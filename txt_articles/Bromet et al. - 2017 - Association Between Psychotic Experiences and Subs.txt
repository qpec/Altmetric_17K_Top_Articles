IMPORTANCE Community-based studies have linked psychotic experiences (PEs) with
increased risks of suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs). However, it is not known if these
associations vary across the life course or if mental disorders contribute to these associations.
OBJECTIVE To examine the temporal association between PEs and subsequent STBs across
the life span as well as the influence of mental disorders (antecedent to the STBs) on these
associations.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A total of 33 370 adult respondents across 19 countries
from the World Health Organization World Mental Health Surveys were assessed for PEs,
STBs (ie, ideation, plans, and attempts), and 21 DSM-IV mental disorders. Discrete-time
survival analysis was used to investigate the associations of PEs with subsequent onset
of STBs.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Prevalence and frequency of STBs with PEs, and odds ratios
and 95% CIs.
RESULTS Of 33 370 included participants, among those with PEs (n = 2488), the lifetime
prevalence (SE) of suicidal ideation, plans, and attempts was 28.5% (1.3), 10.8% (0.7), and
10.2% (0.7), respectively. Respondents with 1 or more PEs had 2-fold increased odds of
subsequent STBs after adjusting for antecedent or intervening mental disorders (suicidal
ideation: odds ratio, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.8-2.6; suicide plans: odds ratio, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.7-2.6; and
suicide attempts: odds ratio, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.5-2.5). There were significant dose-response
relationships of number of PE types with subsequent STBs that persisted after adjustment for
mental disorders. Although PEs were significant predictors of subsequent STB onset across
all life stages, associations were strongest in individuals 12 years and younger. After
adjustment for antecedent mental disorders, the overall population attributable risk
proportions for lifetime suicidal ideation, plans, and attempts associated with temporally
prior PEs were 5.3%, 5.7%, and 4.8%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Psychotic experiences are associated with elevated odds of
subsequent STBs across the life course that cannot be explained by antecedent mental
disorders. These results highlight the importance of including information about PEs in
screening instruments designed to predict STBs.

 P
rior studies suggest that psychotic experiences (PEs)
are associated with an elevated risk of suicidal
thoughts and behaviors (STBs). A 2016 meta-analysis
by Honings et al1 based on 21 studies reported a 3-fold
increased risk of STBs in people with PEs (odds ratio
[OR], 3.2; 95% CI, 2.3-4.4). Other studies have doc-
umented a significant dose-response relationship between
the number of PEs and increased odds of STBs.2-5 Worry-
ingly, prospective studies of school-aged children have
reported strong associations between PEs and suicide
attempts, with children with PEs having an approximately
11-fold increased odds of suicide attempts during the follow-
ing 12 months (OR, 11.3; 95% CI, 4.4-28.6) compared with
those without PEs.6
Despite the growing body of evidence linking the pres-
ence of PEs with STBs, several research questions warrant
closer attention. First, there is considerable variation in effect
size estimates for these associations across studies, likely
owing to differences in methods and analysis.1,7,8 Thus, it
would be informative to examine these associations across
different sites using similar methods. Second, prior studies
have documented that most common mental disorders are
associated with increased odds of both PEs9 and STBs.10-12
However, it is unclear whether the presence of mental disor-
ders explains the associations of PEs with subsequent STBs.13
Third, although it has generally been assumed that mental
disorders could increase the risk of each of 3 main STB out-
comes (ie, ideation, plans, and attempts), recent studies have
shown that only a subset of those with ideation also have sui-
cide plans and attempts.14-16 We examine the role of PEs with
respect to the odds of transitioning between ideation, plans,
and attempts. Fourth, there is evidence to suggest that the
association between PEs and STBs may be stronger in
samples based on children6 compared with estimates based
on adult samples.1 Thus, it would be of interest to examine if
the strength of the association between PEs and STBs
differed across age groups within one study. If children
and/or adolescents with PEs are differentially prone to STBs
compared with older age groups, then this could have impor-
tant clinical implications for screening in pediatric and
adolescent settings.6 Fifth, there is considerable uncertainty
about the population attributable risk proportions (PARPs)
for STBs that are associated with PEs. For example, DeVylder
et al16 reported that about 29% of suicide attempts
were attributable to PEs among US adults. Kelleher et al6
have found that 56% to 75% of suicide attempts among
adolescents aged 13 to 16 years were attributable to PEs
(however, these estimates were imprecise; OR, 67.50; 95% CI,
11.41-399.21). Accurate and age-range specific estimates of
these PARPs are important for policy-making and prevention
purposes.
Specifically, we aimed to examine the association
between PEs (and related PE type and frequency metrics)
and subsequent STBs across the life span and the influence
of mental disorders on these associations. We also exam-
ined the associations between PEs, suicide plans and
attempts among individuals with suicidal ideation, and the
PARPs of various STBs.
Method
Samples
The data were derived from 19 WHO World Mental Health
(WMH) surveys, a coordinated set of community surveys ad-
ministeredinprobabilitysamplesofadultrespondents(18years
and older) in countries throughout the world17 (eTable 1 in the
Supplement). The weighted (by sample size) average re-
sponse rate across the 19 surveys was 72.3%, with the highest
response rate in Iraq (95.2%) and the lowest in France (45.9%).
Further information on details of the procedure and the as-
sessment of mental disorders can be found in the eMethods
in the Supplement. A human subjects review board or ethics
committee approved the survey protocol in each country
(eTable 2 in the Supplement), and all respondents gave in-
formed consent; the mode of consent (written vs oral) varied
by survey.
Measures
Psychotic Experiences
The Composite International Diagnostic Interview Psychosis
Module included questions about 6 PE types—2 related to hal-
lucinatory experiences and 4 related to delusional experi-
ences. We excluded PEs experienced while dreaming, half-
asleep, or under the influence of alcohol or drugs (eTable 3A
and B in the Supplement). In this article, we present esti-
mates of STBs for “Any PEs” only (ie, not individual types of
PEs). In addition, we included 2 key PE variables: (1) number
of PE types; and (2) an annualized frequency metric based on
the frequency of PE episodes (ie, the count of PE occurrences
per year). We derived the latter by dividing the total number
of PE episodes by the time since onset of the first PE (age at
interview minus age at onset plus 1 in order to avoid zero as a
denominator). Age at onset of PEs was also assessed.
Suicidality
Lifetime STBs were assessed using the Composite Interna-
tional Diagnostic Interview Suicidality Module.17 Separate
questions were asked about the lifetime occurrence of sui-
cidal ideation (“Have you ever seriously thought about com-
mitting suicide?”), suicide plans (“Have you ever made a plan
forcommittingsuicide?”),andsuicideattempt(“Haveyouever
Key Points
Question Are psychotic experiences associated with subsequent
suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs), and do mental disorders
(antecedent to the STBs) contribute to these associations?
Findings Based on 33 370 adult survey respondents drawn from
19 countries, those with psychotic experiences had 2-fold
increased odds of subsequent STBs (after adjusting for mental
disorders). Psychotic experiences were predictors of subsequent
STB onset across all life stages; however, the strength of the
association was strongest in individuals 12 years and younger.
Meaning Screening for psychotic experiences may assist in the
prediction of subsequent STBs.

 attempted suicide?”). Information on the age at first occur-
rence for each of these outcomes was obtained retrospec-
tively. Consistent with our goals of examining associations of
PE with a continuum of suicidal behaviors, we considered each
of these 3 primary outcomes in the total sample. In addition,
we examined 3 secondary nested STB outcomes: (1) suicide
plans among respondents with ideation; (2) suicide attempts
among those with both ideation and a plan (ie, planned at-
tempts); and (3) suicide attempts among respondents with ide-
ation but without a plan (ie, unplanned attempts).
Statistical Analysis
The predictive associations of temporally prior PEs with each
STBoutcomewereestimatedusingdiscrete-timesurvivalmod-
els, with person-year as the unit of analysis. A person-year data
set was constructed, where each year in the life of each re-
spondent (up to and including the age of STB onset or age at
interview, whichever came first) was treated as a separate ob-
servational record, with the year of STB onset coded as 1 and
earlier years coded as 0. Psychotic experiences were coded as
1 a year after the first PE onset to ensure that a PE occurring in
the same year as STBs did not count as a predictor. We first es-
timated models of PE and subsequent STBs adjusting for re-
spondent’
s age at time of interview, sex, person-year dum-
mies, and country. In addition, we built models adjusted for
age at time of interview, sex, person-year dummies, country,
and 21 antecedent mental disorders (ie, mental disorders that
had onsets prior to the STBs) to examine the influence of men-
taldisordersontheassociationbetweenPEsandSTBs.Thejoint
significance test and test for linear trend were computed. We
also conducted a post hoc analysis stratified by mental illness
(yes/no)inexaminingwhethertheassociationbetweenPEsand
STBs was observed in both the groups.
Next, we reestimated the associations between PEs and
subsequent STBs after stratifying the sample into 4 life
course stages: childhood (12 years and younger), adoles-
cence (aged 13-19 years), young adulthood (aged 20-29
years), and later adulthood (30 years and older). This
allowed us to examine whether the associations varied
across the life course and the strength of association (in early
vs later years of life), given previous findings of large effect
sizes among adolescents (ORs >10).6,18 Finally, PARPS were
calculated by converting the ORs obtained from the survival
models as approximation of relative risk based on the
assumption that the survival coefficients represented causal
effects.19
As the WMH data are both clustered and weighted, the de-
sign-basedTaylorserieslinearizationimplementedinSUDAAN
software (RTI International) was used to estimate the SEs and
evaluate the statistical significance of the coefficients. Sur-
vival coefficients and their SEs were exponentiated to gener-
ate ORs and 95% CIs. All statistical tests (Wald χ2 based on dis-
crete-timesurvivalmodels)wereevaluatedusing2-sidedtests.
Statistical significance was set at P<.05.
Results
Prevalence of STBs
The lifetime prevalence (SE) of suicidal ideation, plans, and
attempts in all respondents was 9.2% (0.2), 3.1% (0.1), and
2.8% (0.1), respectively (Table 1). Among 5106 individuals
with suicidal ideation, 2000 (33.6%; SE, 0.9) reported a sui-
cide plan. Among the subset of 2000 individuals with sui-
cidal ideation with a plan, the prevalence of suicide attempts
was 55.5% (SE, 1.5). Among the subset of 3106 individuals
with suicidal ideation without a plan, the prevalence of sui-
cide attempts was 17.0% (SE, 0.9). (The proportions for the
nested suicide outcomes reflect different denominators;
eTable 4 in the Supplement.) The lifetime prevalence of
STBs was substantially higher among those with PEs com-
pared with those without PEs (Table 1). Specifically, among
respondents with PEs, the prevalence (SE) of suicidal ide-
ation, plans, and attempts was 28.5% (1.3), 10.8% (0.7), and
10.2% (0.7), respectively, compared with 8.0% (0.2), 2.6%
(0.1), and 2.3% (0.1) for respondents without PEs.

 Associations Between Lifetime PEs and Subsequent Onset
of STBs
Compared with those without PEs, those with any PEs had
3-fold the odds of a subsequent first onset of each STB out-
come after adjusting for demographic factors (Table 2), with
adjusted ORs for suicidal ideation, plans, and attempts of
3.0 (95% CI, 2.6-3.6), 3.4 (95% CI, 2.8-4.1), and 3.1 (95% CI,
2.4-3.9), respectively. Overall, the PE-type metric was sig-
nificant in predicting 3 STBs (χ2 ranged between 137.5 and
256.2; P < .001). The tests for linear trend were also signifi-
cant, with χ2 ranging between 15.0 and 24.7, indicating that
there was a dose-response relationship. The ORs for STBs
among those experiencing 3 or more PE types ranged from
7.1 for ideation (95% CI, 4.9-10.3) to 11.1 for plans (95% CI,
7.1-17.4). There was also a 3-fold to 4-fold increased odds of
various STBs in those with more frequent annualized PEs
(more than 0.3 episodes per year) compared with those with
less frequent annualized PEs (0.3 episodes or less per year),
with ORs ranging from 3.0 for attempts (95% CI, 2.3-4.1) to
3.8 for plans (95% CI, 2.9-5.1).
When we adjusted for 21 antecedent mental disorders,
the effect sizes attenuated but remained statistically signifi-
cant. After adjustment, those with any PEs had twice the
odds of subsequent onset of all 3 STBs. The significant dose-
response relationship between higher PE frequency metrics
and STBs also persisted.
When we restricted the analysis to the subset with sui-
cidal ideation, the associations of any PEs with suicide plans
and suicide attempts were not significant, indicating that PEs
are associated with increased odds of suicidal ideation but not
with an increased odds of planning or attempting suicide
amongthosereportingsuicideideation(eTable5intheSupple-
ment). As a post hoc analysis, we also repeated the analysis
stratified by mental disorders (yes/no). While the 95% CIs were
wider in the subgroup with no mental disorders, the general
pattern of findings persisted (eTable 6 in the Supplement).
Associations Between Lifetime PEs and Subsequent Onset
of STBs Across 4 Life Course Stages
Table3showstheassociationsbetweenPEsandsubsequenton-
set of STBs in 4 life course stages. In the basic demographic ad-
justment models, we found strong and significant associations
between occurrence of PEs and subsequent onset of STBs in all
4lifecoursestages(childhood,adolescence,earlyadulthood,and
later adulthood). The effect sizes were significantly higher in
childhood compared with other age groups (ideation: χ2 = 14.7;
P < .001; plans: χ2 = 17.6; P < .001; and attempts: χ2 = 8.8;
P = .003). The ORs for suicidal ideation, plans, and attempts in
childhoodwere4.0(95%CI,2.3-6.8),7.8(95%CI,3.4-17.9),and
5.4 (95% CI, 2.6-11.3), respectively. When adjusted for anteced-
ent mental disorders, the pattern of associations remained sig-
nificant though the effect sizes were attenuated.

 PARPs Between PEs and STBs
The overall PARPs for suicidal ideation, plans, and attempts
ranged between 8.4% and 11.0% (Table 4) in the basic demo-
graphic adjustment models. After adjustments for anteced-
ent mental disorders, the overall PARPs were smaller, rang-
ing from 4.8% to 5.7%. When examined across the life course,
comparedwitholderagegroups,children12yearsandyounger
consistently had the highest PARPs (9.0%, 20.0%, and 11.1%
for suicidal ideation, plans, and attempts, respectively) after
adjustment for antecedent mental disorders.
Discussion
The results reported here are based on, to our knowledge, the
largest and most detailed study of PEs and STBs reported to
date.WefoundthatcommunityrespondentswhoreportedPEs
had 2-fold increased odds of subsequent suicidal ideation,
plans, and attempts after adjustment for antecedent mental
disorders. These estimates are broadly consistent with sev-
eral longitudinal studies1,5,13,20 but slightly lower than the
pooled estimate from a 2016 meta-analysis.1 We also found a
dose-response relationship between (1) higher numbers of PE
types (in keeping with previous literature)2-5 and (2) higher an-
nualized PE frequency with subsequent STBs. Additionally,
these results shed new light on 4 issues. First, the association
between PEs and STBs persisted after adjustment for anteced-
ent mental disorders. Second, among the subset of respon-
dents reporting suicidal ideation, PEs did not contribute sig-
nificantly to increased odds of subsequent suicide plans or
attempts. Third, the association between PEs and STBs was
most prominent in children 12 years and younger. Fourth, PEs
accountedforanappreciableproportionofSTBs(9%-20%)dur-
ing childhood, even when adjusted for antecedent mental dis-
orders. We discuss each of these in turn.
First, although the association between PEs and STBs was
attenuatedafteradjustmentfor21antecedentmentaldisorders,
appreciableORs(atleast2-fold)werestillfoundbetweenPEsand
STBs.Thesefindingareconsistentwithpreviousstudies1,3,21and
lend weight to the hypothesis that the experience of PEs, even
intheabsenceofmentaldisorders,maybesufficienttoinfluence
thesubsequentonsetofSTBs.Thisisanimportantfindingfrom
aclinicalpointofviewbecauseitsuggeststhatPEsmaybeapre-
dictor of subsequent STBs even in individuals who do not
meet criteria for mental disorders. In keeping with a 2017
commentary,22 we do not propose that the presence of isolated

 PEs is sufficient to identify individuals with an ultrahigh risk of
later transition to psychotic disorder; however, these individu-
alsdohaveanincreasedriskofarangeofotheradverseoutcomes,
includingSTBs.Psychoticexperiencesandsuicidalitymayshare
commonriskfactors(eg,traumaticlifeeventsorfamilyhistory).
Previous research found that the association between PEs and
STBs persisted after adjusting for trauma and experiencing
harm.3,4WehypothesizethatasPEsareassociatedwithbothpsy-
chologicaldistress23anddisability,24,25thesefactorsmaybesuf-
ficienttocontributetotheemergenceofsubsequentSTBs.How-
ever, we note that it is conceivable that PEs and STBs may both
emerge during a prodromal phase of a later mental disorder (ie,
a disorder with an age at onset after prior STBs). Although this
analysisisbeyondthescopeofthecurrentarticle,suchresearch
couldfurtherreinforcetheclinicalutilityofroutinemonitoring
ofPEsinat-risksamples.Futurestudiesmaywishtoincludemea-
sures of disorganized speech, which is a clinical feature of psy-
chotic disorder not routinely included in PE assessment.
Second, we demonstrated, to our knowledge for the first
time, that although PEs were associated with an overall in-
crease in STBs, among those with suicidal ideation, they did
not make an additional contribution to the subsequent tran-
sitiontosuicideplansorplanned/unplannedattempts.Inother
words, while those with PEs had an increased odds of each of
the 3 STB outcomes (ie, suicidal ideation, suicide plans, and
suicideattempts),ourfindingssuggestthatthepresenceofPEs
did not alter the odds of transition from suicidal ideation to
planned or unplanned attempts. This general pattern is con-
sistent with previous research that explored the associations
of mental disorders and these nested STB outcomes.11 How-
ever, the results are in contrast to DeVylder et al,16 who found
that respondents with PEs and suicidal ideation had more than
3-fold increased risk of attempting suicide. This discrepancy
may reflect differences in methods related to the use of tem-
poral ordering between the variables of interest.
Third, we found that PEs were associated with the subse-
quent onset of STBs in each of the 4 life course stages and that
this pattern of associations persisted after adjustment for ante-
cedent mental disorders. Mindful that PEs have a wide age-
at-onset distribution (median [interquartile range], 26 [17-41]
years),26 our findings support the hypothesis that PEs are asso-
ciated with an increased odds of subsequent STBs regardless of
age. However, we confirmed that the association between PEs
and STBs was indeed more prominent in childhood, consistent
with previous findings based on longitudinal studies.5,6,20,27
While our study was based on adult respondents (18 years and
older),itisreassuringtonotethatthestrongassociationbetween
childhood-onsetPEsandSTBshasbeenconfirmedinbothbroad
cross-sectionally ascertained samples, like the WMH, and pro-
spectivelystudiedadolescentcohorts.Futurestudiesmaywish
toexplorebiologicalandpsychosocialfactorsthatcouldexplain
whytheassociationbetweenPEsandsubsequentSTBsisstron-
gerinyoungchildrencomparedwithotheragegroups(eg,adif-
ferential sensitivity to stress28,29).
Finally, we showed that after adjustment for antecedent
mentaldisorders,theoverallPARPestimates(between4.8%and
5.7%)weresmallerthanpreviouslyreported.6,16However,inchil-
dren, the adjusted PARPs (between 9% and 20%) were similar
topreviouslyreportedPARPs.Werecommendcautionwhenin-
terpretingPARPs—theseestimatesassumecausalitybetweenthe

mendation by Kelleher et al6 that clinicians should include PEs
whenassessingriskofSTBsinyoungpeopleandthatfutureclini-
calandepidemiologicstudiesofSTBsshouldincludePE-related
items in their risk factor battery.
Limitations
Thecurrentstudyhasseveralstrengths(largesamplesize,range
ofcountries,uniformmethodsfordatacollection,temporallyor-
dered variables, etc). However, it is important to note the study
limitations. First, although we excluded people who were
screenedpositiveforpossiblepsychoticdisorders,theWMHsur-
veyswereadministeredbylayinterviewers,andclinicalvalida-
tion of self-reported diagnoses of psychosis or mania was not
available.Second,wealsousedretrospectivereportsofageaton-
set of the PEs, STBs, and mental disorders; although rigorously
obtained,30 this is subject to some level of recall bias. However,
we note that 5 prospective studies have confirmed the associa-
tionbetweenPEsandsubsequentSTBs.5,6,20,27,31Third,thesur-
veyswerecross-sectional,andwithoutadditionalfollow-up,we
were unable to examine the association between PEs and com-
pletedsuicide.Weareawareof2prospectivecommunity-based
studies that explored this question, but both lacked sufficient
power (ie, small number of completed suicides) to confidently
estimatetheinfluenceofPEsonthisoutcome.20,32Fourth,itwill
be of interest to explore if particular types of PEs (eg, hallucina-
tions or delusions) are differentially associated with STBs in fu-
ture analyses.
Conclusions
We found that PEs were independently associated with sub-
sequent STBs regardless of antecedent mental disorders.
There were significant dose-dependent relationships
between both number of PE types and annualized frequency
of PEs with subsequent STBs. The association was found at
all ages, with a stronger effect at younger ages, and were
associated with appreciable PARPs. From a public health
perspective, we speculate that the inclusion of PE items in
routine screening tools could improve the prediction of sui-
cide risk. Our study lends additional weight to the call for
the routine inclusion of PE items when assessing STBs in
both research and clinical settings.
