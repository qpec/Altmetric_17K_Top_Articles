Teen childbearing can have negative health, economic, and 
social consequences for mothers and their children (1) and 
costs the United States approximately $9.4 billion annually 
(2). During 1991–2014, the birth rate among teens aged 
15–19 years in the United States declined 61%, from 61.8 
to 24.2 births per 1,000, the lowest rate ever recorded (3). 
Nonetheless, in 2014, the teen birth rate remained approxi-
mately twice as high for Hispanic and non-Hispanic black 
(black) teens compared with non-Hispanic white (white) teens 
(3), and geographic and socioeconomic disparities remain 
(3,4), irrespective of race/ethnicity. Social determinants asso-
ciated with teen childbearing (e.g., low parental educational 
attainment and limited opportunities for education and 
employment) are more common in communities with higher 
proportions of racial and ethnic minorities (4), contributing 
to the challenge of further reducing disparities in teen births. 
To examine trends in births for teens aged 15–19 years by 
race/ethnicity and geography, CDC analyzed National Vital 
Statistics System (NVSS) data at the national (2006–2014), 
state (2006–2007 and 2013–2014), and county (2013–2014) 
levels. To describe socioeconomic indicators previously associ-
ated with teen births, CDC analyzed data from the American 
Community Survey (ACS) (2010–2014).  Nationally, from 
2006 to 2014, the teen birth rate declined 41% overall with 
the largest decline occurring among Hispanics (51%), fol-
lowed by blacks (44%), and whites (35%). The birth rate 
ratio for Hispanic teens and black teens compared with white 
teens declined from 2.9 to 2.2 and from 2.3 to 2.0, respec-
tively. From 2006–2007 to 2013–2014, significant declines 
in teen birth rates and birth rate ratios were noted nationally 
and in many states. At the county level, teen birth rates for 
2013–2014 ranged from 3.1 to 119.0 per 1,000 females aged 
15–19 years; ACS data indicated unemployment was higher, 
and education attainment and family income were lower in 
counties with higher teen birth rates. State and county data 
can be used to understand disparities in teen births and imple-
ment community-level interventions that address the social 
and structural conditions associated with high teen birth rates.
NVSS natality files are compiled annually by CDC’s 
National Center for Health Statistics and include demographic 
information, such as maternal age, race, and Hispanic ethnicity, 
for births in all 50 states and the District of Columbia (DC) 
(3). CDC calculated teen birth rates (number of births per 
1,000 females aged 15–19 years) at the national, state, and 
county level, and birth rate ratios (the birth rates for black

teens and for Hispanic teens compared with white teens), as 
measures of disparities at the national and state level. This 
report includes national data for 2006–2014. For state-specific 
comparisons, 2 years of data were combined for 2006–2007 
and 2013–2014 to provide reliable estimates for each race/
ethnicity group (numerators ≥20). Changes over time were 
evaluated using a Z-test (for birth rates based on counts ≥100), 
or through a comparison of Poisson probability distributions 
(for birth rates based on counts <100, and for birth rate ratios). 
County-specific data were reported for 2013–2014 combined, 
and excluded counties with <20 teen births in total, resulting 
in a final data set accounting for 76% of all counties and 99% 
of all teen births in the United States.
The most recent 5-year estimate (2010–2014) from the U.S. 
Census Bureau’s ACS was used to describe key socioeconomic 
indicators. The ACS is a continual nationwide survey that col-
lects detailed information on demographic, social, economic, 
and housing characteristics (5). Three markers of economic 
opportunity and perceived potential for future opportunities, 
previously used as indicators of social determinants for teen 
childbearing (6), were selected (i.e., percentage of the popula-
tion aged ≥16 years unemployed, percentage of the population 
aged ≥25 years with an associate’s degree or higher, and median 
family income). The value for each indicator was compared 
between U.S. counties in highest and lowest quintiles of teen 
birth rates for 2013–2014. T-tests were used to evaluate dif-
ferences (p<0.05).
Nationally, from 2006 to 2014, the teen birth rate declined 
41% overall (from 41.1 per 1,000 to 24.2 per 1,000). The 
largest decline occurred among Hispanics (51%, from 77.4 to 
38.0), followed by blacks (44%, from 61.9 to 34.9), and then 
whites (35%, from 26.7 to 17.3) (Figure 1). Correspondingly, 
the birth rate ratio for Hispanic teens and black teens com-
pared with white teens declined from 2.9 to 2.2 and from 2.3 
to 2.0, respectively.
The teen birth rate and racial/ethnic disparities for 2013–
2014 ranged widely across states (Table). In some states, these 
disparities reflected very low rates of birth among white teens. 
For example, in New Jersey, the teen birth rate among whites 
(4.8) was well below the national rate for this group (18.0); 
whereas teen birth rates in this state among blacks (27.4) and 
Hispanics (31.3) were also lower than the national rates for 
these groups (blacks: 37.0; Hispanics: 39.8), they were approxi-
mately 6–7 fold higher than the rate for whites. In other states, 
disparities reflected birth rates for black and Hispanic teens 
that exceeded national rates for these groups. For example, in 
Nebraska, the birth rate for white teens (16.2) approximated 
the national rate, whereas rates for black and Hispanic teens 
(42.6 and 53.9, respectively) far exceeded the national rate 
for these groups. Finally, other states had smaller disparities, 
because teen birth rates were relatively high among all racial/
ethnic groups. In Arkansas, for example, the teen birth rate 
was above the national rate for whites (37.7), blacks (54.6) 
and Hispanics (46.5).

From 2006–2007 to 2013–2014, the overall birth rate for 
teens declined significantly in every state, with the percentage 
decline ranging from 13% (North Dakota) to 48% (Arizona). 
In nearly every state, there was a significant decline for all three 
racial/ethnic groups assessed (Table). In many states disparities 
also declined significantly from 2006–2007 to 2013–2014; the 
birth rate ratio declined significantly for black teens compared 
with white teens in 28 states and for Hispanic teens compared 
with white teens in 37 states (p<0.05). However, states with 
the largest percentage decline in teen births did not necessarily 
have the largest declines in racial/ethnic disparities (Table).
U.S. county-level teen birth rates for 2013–2014 ranged 
from 3.1 to 119.0, with median rates of 14.6 and 57.1 for 
the counties in the lowest and highest quintiles for teen birth 
rates, respectively (Figure 2). Many counties with teen birth 
rates in the highest quintile were clustered in the south and 
southwest; some states with low overall birth rates also had 
counties in the highest quintile.
Data from ACS indicated that among counties in the high-
est quintile for teen birth rates, the mean percentage of the 
population aged ≥16 years unemployed, mean percentage of the 
population aged ≥25 years with an associate’s degree or higher, 
and mean family income were 10.5%, 19.9% and $46,005, 
respectively. By comparison, values for all three socioeconomic 
indicators were more favorable among counties in the lowest 
quintile for teen birth rates, at 7.6%, 40.4% and $73,967, 
respectively (p<0.001, for all comparisons).
Discussion
Significant declines in racial/ethnic disparities have accom-
panied the historic decline in the overall teen birth rate in the 
United States since 2006. Nationally, and in many states, the 
largest decline occurred among Hispanic teens followed by 
black and then white teens. Nonetheless, racial/ethnic and 
geographic disparities remain, both within and across states, 
and even where large declines in teen birth rates have occurred. 
The variation in county-level data reinforces the need to use 
local data to focus teen pregnancy prevention efforts on com-
munities with the greatest need.
To address persistent disparities in teen births, the U.S. 
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office of 
Adolescent Health partnered with CDC during 2010–2015 
to fund community-wide initiatives in nine communities with 
some of the highest teen birth rates in the United States (7,8).

This effort focused on black and Hispanic teens and integrated 
activities that addressed social determinants of health at the 
community level (8). Participating communities examined 
local data to develop their activities. Examples of activities 
included presenting community-specific teen birth data to civic 
leaders; encouraging health care providers to offer evening and 
weekend hours and low-cost services to increase access; having 
teen-focused, culturally appropriate materials available dur-
ing health care visits; and implementing evidence-based teen 
pregnancy prevention programs to reach teens of both sexes 
both inside and outside of schools (e.g., through Job Corps, 
alternative schools, churches, and community colleges) (8). 
Preliminary data (9) indicate that each community increased 
the number of teens who received reproductive health services 
and evidence-based interventions, as well as the proportion of 
teens who received moderately or highly effective contraceptive 
methods. Many aspects of the community-wide initiatives have 
been incorporated in Teen Pregnancy Prevention Replication 
grants awarded in 2015 by the Office of Adolescent Health to 
communities with the greatest need (10).
The findings in this report are subject to at least three limi-
tations. First, teen birth rate estimates for some racial/ethnic 
groups (i.e., American Indian/Alaskan Natives and Asian 
Pacific Islanders in all states; blacks in Montana; Hispanics 
in Vermont; and all racial/ethnic groups by county) were not 
available at the state and county level because of small popula-
tion sizes. Second, while this report examined each major race/
ethnicity group overall, there are differences in teen birth rates 
among subgroups within these populations, such as Mexican, 
Puerto Rican, and Cuban persons of Hispanic ethnicity (3). 
Finally, information on economic data, unemployment, and 
educational attainment provides useful information about 
community context for preventing teen pregnancy, but does 
not provide a direct link with individual-level factors.
Despite substantial declines in teen births in the United 
States, disparities by race/ethnicity and geography persist,

highlighting the continuing need for teen pregnancy preven-
tion efforts. Understanding disparities in teen birth rates and 
the multiple causes at the local level can help target effective 
interventions for populations with the greatest need (4). 
Ongoing efforts to integrate social determinants of health 
into teen pregnancy prevention program play a critical role in 
addressing racial/ethnic and geographical disparities observed 
in teen births in the United States.
Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Despite record declines in the rate of births among teens, racial/
ethnic and geographic disparities persist.
What is added by this report?
From 2006 to 2014, the birth rate for teens aged 15–19 years 
declined 41% overall (from 41.1 to 24.2 per 1,000 females). The 
greatest decline was for Hispanics (51%), followed by non-
Hispanic blacks (blacks) (44%), and non-Hispanic whites (whites) 
(35%). From 2006–2007 to 2013–2014, the overall birth rate for 
teens declined significantly in every state, with declines ranging 
from 13% in North Dakota to 48% in Arizona; the birth rate ratio 
also declined for black teens compared with white teens in 
28 states and for Hispanic teens compared with white teens in 
37 states. County-level teen birth rates for 2013–2014 ranged 
from 3.1 to 119.0 per 1,000 females aged 15–19 years; 
unemployment was higher, and education attainment and family 
income were lower in counties with higher teen birth rates.
What are the implications for public health practices?
Community-level interventions that address the social condi-
tions associated with high teen birth rates might further reduce 
racial/ethnic and geographic teen birth disparities in the United 
States. State and county-level data can be used to identify 
populations with the greatest need.
