Objectives. To review the contributions of the Nurses’ Health Studies (NHSs) to the
understanding of cardiovascular disease etiology in women.
Methods. We performed a narrative review of the publications of the NHS and NHS II
between 1976 and 2016.
Results.Dietslowintransfat,saturatedfat,refinedcarbohydrates,andsugar-sweetened
beverages and rich in fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and sources of unsaturated fats
are associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. Healthy lifestyle choices include
smoking avoidance, regular physical activity, maintaining a normal body mass index, and
moderate alcohol consumption. Adherence to a combination of these healthy diet and
lifestyle behaviors may prevent most vascular events. Studies also covered oral contra-
ceptive use, postmenopausal hormone therapy, shift work, sleep duration, psychosocial
factors, and various biomarkers and genetic factors. Findings, such as the association
of trans fat with cardiovascular disease, have helped shaped medical guidelines and
government policies.
Conclusions. The NHS has provided compelling evidence that the majority of vascular
events may be prevented by avoiding smoking, participating in regular physical activity,
maintaining normal body mass index, and eating a healthy diet. (Am J Public Health. 2016;

ardiovascular disease (CVD) has
remained the leading cause of death in
the United States for more than 8 decades.1
Since their inceptions in 1976 and 1989,
the Nurses’ Health Studies (NHS) I and II,
respectively, have contributed much new
knowledge with the goal of reducing CVD
incidence and mortality. A search on PubMed
forthe“Nurses’HealthStudy,”“cardiovascular
disease,” “myocardial infarction,” “heart dis-
ease,” and “stroke” yields more than 300
primary articles. Many more have been
published related to the risk factors of CVD,
such as hypertension.
The breadth of exposures examined is
great: dietary variables include macronutri-
ents, micronutrients, nonnutrient dietary
constituents, foods, beverages, and dietary
patterns; lifestyle and other factors such
as smoking, physical activity, adiposity,
body fat distribution, sleep-related and
psychosocial exposures characterize earlier
studies from the NHS. The NHS research on
exogenous hormone use, including oral
contraceptives and postmenopausal hor-
mone therapy, is addressed in Bhupathiratju
et al. in this issue. More recently, biomarkers
in plasma and red blood cells, as well as
genetic factors, have been investigated.
These articles have been included in
many systematic reviews and have greatly
contributed to clinical guidelines, public
health campaigns, and government policies.
DIETARY FACTORS
Table 1 details the major findings of dietary
factors and CVD in the NHS.
CVD was once thought to be an inevitable
consequence of aging and related risk
factors,2 but evidence from cross-country
comparisons by Keys suggested that diet was
an important determinant of CVD risk.3
However, this ecological analysis was limited
by intractable confounding and limited
dietary data. A theoretical framework for
modern nutritional epidemiology research
initially arose largely out of work from the
NHS, and these techniques have become
the basis for a large body of research relating
diet to CVD.4 See Hu et al. in this issue
(p1567) for additional discussion on the
development of these techniques.
Macro- and Micronutrients
Initial dietary advice for the prevention of
coronary heart disease (CHD), largely on the
basis of small controlled feeding studies with
serum cholesterol as the outcome, emphasized
replacing saturated fat with polyunsaturated
fat.4 It is likely that the early decline in
CHD mortality in the United States was
largely owing to the resulting replacement
of saturated fat with polyunsaturated fat.
However, beginning in the early 1980s,
dietary guidelines emphasized that Americans
should limit their total fat intake, including
both saturated and unsaturated fats. Today,
we have a clearer picture of the role of types

 of fats and carbohydrates and their relation-
ships to disease risk.
Although ideally these questions would be
settled by large randomized trials, problems,
such as high rates of attrition, nonadherence,
incomplete blinding, short follow-up time,
and unethicality of studying harmful in-
terventions, have largely prevented such
trials from yielding informative results.4
Conversely, prospective cohort studies allow
the study of a wide range of exposures in
free-living populations. Thus, a combination
of replicated long-term prospective studies,
such as the NHS, combined with controlled
feeding studies with intermediate risk
factors as outcomes, will usually provide
the best evidence for causal effects of
dietary factors.
One of the major achievements of
nutritional epidemiology research is the near
elimination of industrial trans-fatty acids
from diets of the United States and many
other countries. In 1993, the first study of
trans-fatty acids in a large prospective cohort
showed that intake was strongly associated
with CHD risk,5 and this was confirmed in
subsequent analyses in the NHS and other
cohorts.6,7 With findings that trans-fatty
acids are even worse than are saturated fatty
acids because they lower high-density
lipoproteins (HDL) and elevate low-density
lipoproteins,8 the US Department of
Agriculture Dietary Guidelines in 2000
recommended a reduction in trans fat intake,9
which has been emphasized in subsequent
dietary guidelines in the United States and
elsewhere.
The role of saturated fatty acid intake
in the etiology of CHD has been a point
of contention, with recent meta-analyses
concluding that saturated fatty acid intake has
no role in CHD risk. The most important
reason for the null results is that contributing
studies typically did not specify the reference
macronutrient in an isocaloric model.
Because about half of total energy in most
Western diets consists of carbohydrates
(mostly refined starch and sugar), saturated
fat was compared mainly with these un-
healthy forms of carbohydrates by default. In
a recent analysis, the intake of saturated fat
was compared with the same number of
calories from unsaturated fats and from
different sources of carbohydrates in relation
to CHD risk in the NHS and the Health
Professionals’ Follow-up Study (HPFS).10
Replacing saturated fat with equivalent
energy from polyunsaturated fats, mono-
unsaturated fats, or carbohydrates from whole
grains was associated with a significant
reduction in CHD risk, whereas replacing
saturated fat with carbohydrates from refined
starches or added sugars was not associated
with CHD risk. This finding, together
with findings on the effects of these fats on
blood lipids, indicates that unsaturated fats,
especially polyunsaturated fats, or high-
quality carbohydrates can be used to replace
saturated fats to reduce CHD risk. However,
as reported in an earlier pooled analysis of
cohort studies, replacing saturated fat with
overall carbohydrates is not associated with
a lower risk of CHD.
Traditionally, carbohydrates have been
classified as simple or complex on the basis of
chemical structures. However, many com-
plex carbohydrates or starchy foods, such
as baked potatoes, corn, and white bread,
produce even higher glycemic responses

 than do simple sugars. Thus, the concept
of glycemic index was introduced to rep-
resent the quality of carbohydrate-containing
foods on the basis of their ability to raise
postprandial blood sugar. Glycemic load, the
product of the glycemic index value of a food
and its carbohydrate content, first described
in an NHS report, has been developed to
represent the quality and quantity of carbo-
hydrates consumed.11 In the NHS, a higher
dietary glycemic load was associated with an
elevated risk of CHD and ischemic stroke,
possibly via an HDL cholesterol lowering and
fasting triacylglycerol-raising effect of high
glycemic load. The increased risk was more
pronounced among overweight and obese
women, suggesting that the adverse effects of
a high glycemic load diet are exacerbated by
underlying insulin resistance. A diet rich in
fiber, especially cereal fiber, was associated
with a lower CHD risk in the NHS.12
In addition to macronutrients, various
micronutrients have been the subject of
investigation in the NHS. Both vitamin E13
and vitamin C14 intake, mainly from sup-
plementation sources, were associated with
reduced incidence of CHD in mostly healthy
participants. However, these results have
not been replicated in randomized trials of
high-risk patients, perhaps because of the
dissimilarity of participants with regard to
baseline risk and because most primary
prevention trials had shorter durations of
exposure and follow-up times. Higher folate
and vitamin B6 intake was associated with
lower risk of CHD, and the inverse associ-
ation was particularly strong among women
who regularly drank alcohol. Calcium was
reported to predict lower rates of stroke but
not CHD.
Conversely, 2 separate analyses indicated
that dietary magnesium intake was associated
with lower rates of sudden cardiac death
but not stroke or CHD, although plasma
magnesium appeared to be inversely
associated with stroke. Finally, studies of
plant-derived compounds found that both
carotenoid15 and flavonoid16 intake was
associated with lower CVD risk. Specifically,
flavonones (derived primarily from citrus
fruits) and anthocyanidins (derived primarily
from berries) showed the strongest inverse
associations with CHD mortality, although
no significant relationships were observed
with stroke mortality.16
Foods and Beverages
Before the NHS, analyses of the associ-
ation of individual foods and beverages with
the risk of CVD were limited. The gradual
shift from small case–control studies to
large prospective cohort studies using vali-
dated food frequency questionnaires allowed
these scientific questions to be investigated
with less concern about reverse causation,
selection bias, and recall bias.
One of the early reports from the NHS
was published in 1988; it showed that mod-
erate alcohol intake was related to a reduced
risk of stroke.17 Follow-up articles confirmed
inverse associations of alcohol intake with
CHD and ischemic stroke, and more recent
publications corroborate the relationship
between light to moderate alcohol intake and
risk of myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac
death, and hypertension.18 Using a Mendelian
randomization approach, studies of variants
of alcohol dehydrogenase and cholesteryl ester
transfer protein indicate that genetically
associated moderate alcohol intake was related
to higher HDL levels and a substantially
decreased risk of CVD, providing causal
evidence for this relationship. See Mostofsky
et al. in this issue for additional discussion
on research involving alcohol.
Results from the NHS have provided
strong evidence to counter earlier concerns
that coffee consumption may increase the risk
of CHD. A meta-analysis of case–control
and cohort studies in 1994 suggested a mod-
erate increase in risk when drinking 5 cups
versus none, whereas a publication from the
NHS found a null association.19 The picture
became clearer by the late 2000s, with newer
studies indicating no increased risk of CHD
with regular consumption of coffee and even
a modest reduction in stroke risk. An updated
analysis of the NHS found that moderate
coffee consumption (3–5 cups per day) is
associatedwitha significantlylower riskoftotal
and CVD mortality.20 Earlier findings linking
coffee to increased CVD risk may be owing
torecallbias, whichiscommonincase–control
studies, and confounding by smoking.
The consumption of sugar-sweetened
beverages has been implicated in weight gain
and type 2 diabetes in the NHS,21 and recent
studies have found a deleterious effect of
sugar-sweetened beverages on heart health.
Two articles found positive relationships of
sugar-sweetened beverage intake with CHD
and stroke. These reports add to the growing
body of evidence that sugar-sweetened bev-
erage consumption is an important driver of
the obesity epidemic and its cardiometabolic
complications, laying the foundation for
current public health recommendations and
policies to reduce sugar-sweetened beverages.
The NHS group has examined other
individual foods in relation to CVD. For
example, regular consumption of nuts was
associated with lower CHD incidence and
CVD mortality22; egg consumption was not
associated with risk except in those with
diabetes, signifying that dietary cholesterol
in and of itself may not predict disease
incidence; and increased whole grain
consumption was associated with a lower risk
of CVD. In addition, higher consumption
of fruits and vegetables was associated with
a lower risk of CVD incidence and mor-
tality.23 An updated analysis in NHS and
HPFS found that the total amount of fruits
and vegetables consumed was a more im-
portant determinant of CHD than was the
variety of fruits and vegetables. Plausible
biological mediators include potassium,
which reduces blood pressure, and phy-
tochemicals such as carotenoids15 and
flavonoids,16 which have both been linked
to lower CHD risk in the NHS.
Red meat has been a recent target of
investigation. Four articles from the NHS
point to heightened risks of CHD incidence
and CVD mortality as well as unfavorable
plasma concentrations of inflammatory
biomarkers with a higher consumption of
red meat, especially processed meat, than
of other major protein sources, such as
poultry, fish, nuts, and legumes. The high
levels of both saturated fatty acids and heme
iron in red meats have been implicated
in this relationship. Dairy intake has been
inconsistently associated with CVD out-
comes, depending on the types of dairy
and the types of CVD endpoints,24 and
additional investigation is needed.
Dietary patterns, specifically the Medi-
terranean diet, have garnered significant
interest in the scientific community. In the
NHS, a significant inverse association was
observed between adherence to a Mediter-
ranean diet pattern and the risk of CHD
and stroke.25 In addition, a study using
principal component analysis reported that

 a Western diet, which is characterized by
a high intake of processed meats, refined
grains, and French fries, was independently
associated with a higher risk of CHD,
whereas adherence to the prudent diet
characterized by a high intake of fruits,
vegetables, legumes, fish, poultry, and whole
grains was related to a lower risk.26
Similarly, adherence to a Dietary
Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet
predicted lower CHD and stroke incidence.
Finally, the NHS group developed the
Alternative Healthy Eating Index-2010,
which is a tool grounded on 11 of the most
important components of a healthy diet
within the cohort. This new index, designed
to overcome the limitations of the US
Dietary Guidelines for Americans, was
associated with substantially lower CVD
incidence and mortality in the NHS, the
HPFS, the NIH-AARP Diet and Health
Study, the Whitehall cohort, and the
Women’s Health Initiative.
NONDIETARY LIFESTYLE
FACTORS
Table 2 details the major findings for
nondietary lifestyle factors and the risk
of CVD in the NHS.
Aspects of lifestyle in addition to diet
have been examined in the NHS in relation
to risk of CVD. Although perhaps sur-
prising to some readers, the relationship
between smoking and CHD in women was
a matter of controversy in the early 1970s.
This question was the subject of an early
publication from the NHS in 1987,27 which
found a clear dose–response relationship
between the number of cigarettes smoked
daily and the risk of nonfatal myocardial
infarction and fatal CHD. A follow-up
article showed a similar positive relationship
with stroke and provided convincing
evidence that smoking was associated with
CVD in women. Later analyses concluded
that smoking cessation was associated
with a lower risk of stroke and CHD and
that passive smoking was related to CHD.
Although smoking cessation is reported
to be associated with weight gain, the net
effect is in favor of cessation to lower
CVD risk.
The data from the NHS have demon-
strated the critical role of physical activity in
preventing CVD. In middle-aged and older
women, even moderate intensity physical
activity such as brisk walking was associated
with a lower risk of CHD.28 Likewise,
higher physical activity levels were associated
with a lower risk of total and ischemic
stroke. A brisk or striding walking pace
was related to a lower risk of both CHD
and stroke compared with an average or
casual pace.
The range of optimal body weight has
been a long-standing subject of NHS in-
vestigations, in part because of the 1990
Dietary Guideline conclusion that optimal
body weight increased with age and was
above a body mass index (BMI; defined as
weight in kilograms divided by the square of
height in meters) of 25.0 for those older
than 35 years. In a 1990 report, BMI was
monotonically related to a higher incidence
of nonfatal and fatal CHD.29 At the time,
obesity was not an established risk factor
for CHD despite strong links with diabetes,
hypertension, and dyslipidemia. An analysis
conducted in response to the 1990 US
weight guidelines concluded that the
positive association existed even within
the recommended “normal” (at the time):
a BMI range of 21.0 to 27.0.2,30 This study
helped shift the definition of a normal BMI
range to the 18.5–24.9 we know today.
Later studies linked elevated BMI with
stroke and high blood pressure31 and in-
creased abdominal adiposity with CHD.
An article in 2001 warned against being
overweight or even in the upper end of the

 new normal weight range, because this was
linked with a significantly increased risk
of total CVD and stroke. In 2008, the first
analysis on waist circumference implicated
high waist circumference in excess CVD
mortality.32 Several analyses from the NHS
showed that even moderate weight gain
since young adulthood (aged 18 years) was
associated with a subsequent risk of CHD
incidence and CVD mortality.30 In addition,
being physically active did not completely
mitigate the deleterious effects of being
overweight or obese on CVD risk. Fur-
thermore, obesity and physical inactivity
independently contributed to CHD risk in
the NHS, underscoring the importance of
both maintaining a healthy weight and en-
gaging in regular physical activity in pre-
venting CHD.33
The complex relationship between ex-
ogenous hormone use (oral contraceptives
and postmenopausal hormone therapy) and
CVD outcomes has been extensively studied
in the NHS and NHS II. These findings
are discussed in detail in Bhupathiraju et al.
in this issue (p1631).
The nature of the nursing occupation has
allowed our researchers to conduct unique
analyses regarding sleep and shift work. In
1995, we conducted the largest investigation
of shift work and CVD and found that
performing shift work for 6 or more years
was associated with a 51% increased risk of
CHD.34 This conclusion was confirmed
for stroke. With regard to sleep duration,
findings point to a U-shaped relationship,
with an optimal length of 8 hours of sleep
a day. Additionally, snoring was associated
with a modest but significantly increased
risk of CVD in women, independent of age,
smoking, BMI, and other cardiovascular risk
factors. Later analyses demonstrated that
longer sleep duration was associated with
higher concentrations of circulating
C-reactive protein and that a short or longer
sleep duration was associated with lower
levels of HDL, providing plausible biological
mechanisms for these relationships.
With respect to psychosocial factors,
high levels of phobic anxiety were associ-
ated with an increased risk of fatal CHD and
sudden cardiac death, perhaps owing to
elevated levels of leptin and inflammatory
markers. In 1992, participants were asked
about caregiving, employment
characteristics, and depressive symptoms.
High levels of caregiving responsibilities
and depression but not job strain were as-
sociated with higher CHD incidence.
Dietary and lifestyle factors together
have a more powerful effect on CVD risk
than does any single factor alone. In the
NHS, the incidence of CHD was 80%
lower among women who did not smoke,
were not overweight, maintained a healthful
diet (high in cereal fiber, fish, folate, and
polyunsaturated fats and low in saturated
fatty acids, trans-fatty acids, and glycemic
load), exercised moderately or vigorously
for 30 minutes on most days, and consumed
alcohol moderately (half a drink per day
or more) compared with the rest of the
cohort.35
Similar findings were recently reported
for younger women in the NHS II.36

 A healthy diet and lifestyle pattern was also
associated with a 54% lower risk of ischemic
stroke, a 40% lower risk of total stroke,37
and an 81% lower risk of sudden cardiac
death.38 These data indicate that diet and
lifestyle modification could prevent most
CVD events. An online risk calculator was
developed using these results to help in-
dividuals track their own risk and target
those areas that need the greatest
improvement.
BIOMARKERS AND GENETIC
FACTORS
Tables 3 and 4, respectively, detail the
major findings of biomarker and genetic
studies and CVD in the NHS.
In additional to general diet and lifestyle
research, biomarker and genetic data from
the NHS has helped enrich the fields of
clinical, genetic, and basic biological research
regarding CVD. The first NHS analyses
on biomarker data in relation to CVD risk
linked inflammatory markers, such as
C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and
tumor necrosis factor receptors I and II
to CHD incidence and found that these
markers were predictive of coronary
events.39,40 In addition, low levels of HDL
and high levels of homocysteine and lipo-
protein(a) were associated with elevated
CHD risk. Also, higher levels of plasma long
chain n-3 fatty acids were associated with
a lower risk of nonfatal myocardial in-
farction. Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate,
a precursor to androgen and estrogen,
was associated with a heightened risk of
myocardial infarction but a lower risk of
stroke, warranting further investigation.
Plasma insulin-like growth factor 1 and
binding protein 3 were not related to
myocardial infarction risk, although the
results were limited by low statistical power.
Furthermore, fasting levels of plasma vitamin
B6 were inversely related to myocardial
infarction incidence. Other analyses
concluded that toenail nicotine, placental
growth factor, N-terminal pro-B-type
natriuretic peptide, lipoprotein-associated
phospholipase A2, HDL with apoC-III,
hemoglobin A1c, oxidized phospholipids
on apolipoprotein B, and retinol-binding
protein 4 were associated with an elevated
risk of CVD; greater plasma high molecular
weight adiponectin, magnesium,41,42 and
25-hydroxyvitamin D were associated
with a lower CVD risk; dairy biomarkers,
oxidized low-density lipoprotein, ferritin,
toenail mercury, telomere length, and
fetuin-A had null relationships with
CVD risk.
In the NHS, parental history of myo-
cardial infarction was associated with an
increased risk of CHD.43 Within the NHS,
the first investigation of a single gene and
CVD risk was for alcohol dehydrogenase, as
mentioned by Hines et al.44 Later candidate
gene or gene score analyses characterized
CVD risks for variants in the genes for
adiponectin, aP2, CCR2 and CCR5,

 PPARG2, lymphotoxin-a, complement
factor H, ABCA1, C-reactive protein,
cardiac sodium channels, endothelial lipase,
lipoprotein lipase, a common variant at
chromosome 9p21, a genetic risk score for
BMI,several CHD susceptibilityloci,NFKB1,
ADRB1, blood type, and haptoglobin.
Using a genome-wide association study in
the NHS, a variant for glutamate metabolism
was found to predict CHD incidence only
among patients with diabetes. A genome-
wide association study analysis from the
NHS and HPFS demonstrated that an
integrative systems biology approach could
successfully replicate previous findings of loci
associated with low-density lipoproteins,
HDL, apoB, and triglycerides.45 Gene–
environment interactions have also been ex-
plored, with the finding that a polymorphism
in the CETP gene modifies the effect of
alcohol on HDL cholesterol. Altogether, these
publications add to previous reports by
allowing further insight into the biochemical
and genetic basis of CVD.
CONCLUSIONS
Compelling evidence from the NHS
suggests that the incidence of CVD is
strongly influenced by dietary and lifestyle
factors. Robust data from the cohort have
identified unhealthy diet, smoking, obesity,
physical inactivity, and unhealthy sleep
patterns as important determinants of CVD
in women. These results have been con-
firmed in men and in other cohorts.
Consistent with results from dietary in-
tervention studies, the NHS findings support
the notion that the types of fats and car-
bohydrates are more important than the
total amounts in determining the risk of
CVD. Data from the NHS provide strong
evidence that dietary patterns rich in fruits,
vegetables, whole grains, nuts, and seafood
and low in red and processed meats, sugar-
sweetened beverages, and refined grains
reduce the risk of CVD. The NHS data
indicate that approximately 80% of CHD
incidence could be prevented by avoiding
smoking, consuming a healthful diet,
engaging in moderate to vigorous physical
activity for at least 30 minutes most days,
and consuming alcohol moderately (half
a drink to 1 drink per day).
The large volume of evidence generated
from the NHS in the past 4 decades has
contributed not just to science but also to
public health recommendations and polices
in developing guidelines regarding diet,
obesity, and physical activity (see Hu et al.
[p1567] and Colditz et al. [p1540] in this
issue). As we continue to investigate various
aspects of diet, lifestyle, and environmental
exposures, we have unique opportunities to
examine novel biomarkers, genetics, gene–
environment interactions, epigenetics,
metabolomics, and the gut microbiome in
relation to the risk of CVD. These new
investigations will afford us additional in-
sight to elucidate CVD pathways and to
develop innovative approaches to reduce
vascular risks.
