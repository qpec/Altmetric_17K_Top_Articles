Abstract
Background—Laboratory-based studies on neuromuscular control after concussion and 
epidemiological studies suggest that concussion may increase the risk of subsequent 
musculoskeletal injury.
Objective—The purpose of this study was to determine if athletes have an increased risk of lower 
extremity musculoskeletal injury after return-to-play from a concussion.
Methods—Injury data were collected from 2006–2013 for men’s football and women’s 
basketball, soccer, and lacrosse at a NCAA Division I university. Ninety cases in 73 athletes (52 
Male, 21 Female) of in-season concussion with return-to-play at least 30 days prior to the end of 
the season were identified. A period of up to 90 days of in-season competition following return-to-

 play was reviewed for time-loss injury. The same period was studied in up to two control athletes 
who were without a concussion within the prior year and were matched on sport, starting status, 
and position.
Results—Lower extremity musculoskeletal injuries occurred at a higher rate in the concussed 
athletes (45/90 or 50%) compared to the non-concussed athletes (30/148 or 20%) (p < 0.01). The 
odds of sustaining a musculoskeletal injury were 3.39 times higher in the concussed athletes (95% 
CI = 1.90, 6.05; p < 0.01). Overall, the number of days lost due to injury was similar between 
concussed and non-concussed athletes (Median = 9 vs 15, p = 0.41).
Conclusions—The results of this study demonstrate a relationship between concussion and an 
increased risk of lower extremity musculoskeletal injury after return to play, and may have 
implications for current medical practice standards regarding the evaluation and management of 
concussion injuries.
Introduction
Sports and recreation-related concussion is a common injury with an estimated incidence of 
1.6 to 3.6 million annually in the United States [1, 2]. Concussions are known to result in 
transient decrements of neurocognitive function; however, previous studies have 
demonstrated that alterations may exist across multiple domains of function, including 
neuromuscular control. For example, there is a growing body of evidence that post-
concussion neuromuscular control impairments are present during simple gait-related tasks 
such as obstacle navigation, obstacle clearance, gait initiation, and gait termination [3–9]. 
These neuromuscular control impairments extend well beyond symptomatic recovery and 
fulfillment of return to play criteria [6, 10]. Given the limited challenge posed by these gait 
tasks, neuromuscular control impairments are likely to be accentuated during high-demand 
athletic tasks.
Poor neuromuscular control has been demonstrated to be a risk factor for musculoskeletal 
injury. For example, abnormal movement patterns in the lower extremity and trunk have 
been shown to be different between high and low risk groups for anterior cruciate ligament 
injury; in particular, excessive frontal plane motion at the knee and poor trunk control have 
been found to be predictive of injury [11, 12]. As neuromuscular performance impairments 
have been demonstrated in concussed athletes even after the point of return to play, there 
may be an undefined ”window of susceptibility” during which the risk of experiencing 
serious musculoskeletal injuries is increased.
The potential for such an increased risk of musculoskeletal injury after concussion has been 
observed in recently published studies in professional athletes. Nordstrom et. al. examined 
an injury registry comprised of 46 elite male professional soccer clubs from the 2001/02 to 
2011/12 seasons [13]. Sixty-six cases of concussion were examined and were found to have 
a hazard ratio of 1.70 for sustaining an acute-onset musculoskeletal injury in the year after 
concussion compared to the year prior to concussion. The hazard ratios for acute-onset 
injury in comparison to non-concussed players ranged from 1.76 to 3.69 depending on the 
duration of time from the concussion injury. Cross et. al. noted similar findings among 
professional rugby players, with the incidence of any injury for players who returned to play

 in the same season following a diagnosed concussion being 60% higher compared to non-
concussed players [14]. Finally, Pietrosimone et. al. employed a survey of 2429 retired 
professional football players and demonstrated an association of multiple injury types in 
players who also reported a history of concussion [15]. The number of injuries experienced 
was also found to increase with increasing number of concussions.
Similar findings have been noted in collegiate populations. Lynall et. al. examined the risk of 
injury of concussed collegiate athletes in comparison to their risk of injury over the prior 
year and to that of matched non-concussed control athletes [16]. They reported that 
concussed athletes were 1.97 times more likely to have experienced an acute lower extremity 
musculoskeletal injury in the 365 days post-concussion than prior to concussion, and 1.64 
times more likely to have such an injury in comparison to the matched controls. Brooks et. 
al. also examined the risk of musculoskeletal injury in concussed collegiate athletes 
compared to non-concussed controls, finding that the odds of concussed players 
experiencing an injury to be 2.48 times that of the control athletes over a 90 day follow up 
window [17].
However, there are limitations to this data. In particular, some of the above studies [13–15] 
lack controls for relative amounts of participation; hence, it is possible that the relationship 
between concussion and musculoskeletal injury may have been a function of higher rates of 
exposure (e.g. starters versus reserve players). In addition to recall bias associated with 
retrospective survey data, the temporal relationship between the injuries is not known in the 
study by Pietrosimone et. al. [15]; that is, the concussions experienced may or may not have 
been prior to the reported musculoskeletal injuries. Finally, with the exception of the study 
by Pietrosimone et. al., the number of athletes studied has been relatively limited; while 
Lynall et. al. used a mixed-sex cohort, there have been no sex-specific comparisons of injury 
rates after concussion.
In summary, there is evidence from both laboratory-based studies on neuromuscular control 
after concussion and epidemiological studies to suggest that concussion may increase the 
risk of subsequent musculoskeletal injury. An increased risk of musculoskeletal injury 
following concussion may necessitate changes in clinical management and rehabilitation of 
concussion injuries; thus accurate knowledge of the parameters of this potential relationship 
is required. The purpose of this study was to determine the risk of experiencing a time-loss 
lower extremity musculoskeletal injury after return to play from concussion in collegiate 
athletes (“time-loss” defined as being withheld from competition for at least one day). We 
hypothesized that athletes who had experienced a concussion would be at higher odds for 
injury during an in-season period of up to 90 days after return to play compared to non-
concussed athletes matched on sport, starting status, and position. Furthermore, we 
hypothesized that the severity of injuries experienced would be greater in the athletes who 
had experienced a concussion (“severity” defined as number of time-loss days).

 Study design
This investigation was designed as an observational historical cohort study. Exposed athletes 
were those with an in-season concussion as diagnosed by the university primary care sports 
medicine certified physician assigned to each athlete’s sport team. Non-exposed athletes 
were those without a concussion. Exposed and non-exposed athletes were matched by sport, 
starting status (starter, reserve), and main position played. Players were determined to be 
starters if they started in 50% or greater available matches during the season studied, and 
were classified as reserves if they started in less than 50% available matches. The goal ratio 
of non-exposed to exposed players was 2 to 1. In the event that more than two non-exposed 
athletes were qualified to be matched to a given exposed athlete, the two non-exposed 
athletes used for analysis were selected from the pool of available non-exposed athletes 
using a random sequence generator. A given non-exposed athlete was only matched to one 
exposed athlete at any given time during the study.
Exclusion criteria
Athletes were excluded if 1) there was a history of concussion within the prior six months 
(either group), 2) the concussion occurred outside the competitive season (e.g. off-season or 
spring football), 3) the player had time loss within 30 days of return to play due to issues 
unrelated to a musculoskeletal injury (e.g. suspension), or 4) the duration of the remaining 
competitive season at the time of return to play from a concussion was less than 30 days.
Outcomes
The main outcome of interest was the first time-loss lower extremity musculoskeletal injury 
(yes, no) in athletes exposed to concussion and the matched non-exposed athletes within up 
to 90 days of in-season return to play after the concussion. Time-loss was defined as being 
withheld from competition for at least one day. Each exposed athlete and their respective 
matched non-exposed athlete(s) were followed for the outcome of interest along the same 
exact time line starting at day one of the exposed athlete’s full return to play after 
concussion and ending after 90 days. Any injuries which occurred after the first 
musculoskeletal injury during the 90 day follow-up period were not included in the analysis. 
A musculoskeletal injury was defined was a strain, sprain, dislocation, or rupture but did not 
include overuse injuries, fractures, or contusions. A secondary outcome of interest was 
severity, defined as the number of days the player was withheld from competition due to 
lower extremity musculoskeletal injury.
Data collection
Training room-base injury surveillance data (SIMS, Iowa City, IA) from an elite Division I 
collegiate athletics program (The University of Florida Athletic Association) was queried for 
cases of concussion from the 2006/07 to 2012/13 seasons for men’s football and women’s 
basketball, soccer, and lacrosse. For each study subject, the following data were collected: 
player identification number, status (exposed, non-exposed to concussion), gender (male, 
female), age (years), sport (football, basketball, soccer, lacrosse), main position played (see 
Table 1), starting status (starter, reserve), lower extremity musculoskeletal injury (yes, no) 
and time lost from any lower extremity musculoskeletal injury (days).

 Data analyses
The incidence of sustaining a lower extremity musculoskeletal injury was compared between 
athletes exposed or non-exposed to concussion by using a chi-square test. Univariate 
conditional logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the odds of sustaining a lower 
extremity musculoskeletal injury in athletes with a recent concussion compared to athletes 
without concussion. In addition, the odds of lower extremity musculoskeletal injury were 
compared between athletes exposed or non-exposed to concussion on the basis of sex (male, 
female) and starting status (starter, reserve). Survival curves for time (days) to lower 
extremity musculoskeletal injury during competition in athletes affected and non-affected 
with concussion were estimated by using the Kaplan-Meier test. Median time to injury 
(days) during competition and median time to lost due to lower extremity musculoskeletal 
injury (days) were compared between groups using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.
Results
The study sample included 52 male and 21 female athletes with a total of 90 qualifying 
exposures (Table 1). Two matching non-exposed athletes (82M, 34F) were available for 58 
cases, while only one matching non-exposed athlete (24M, 8F) was available for 32 cases. 
Thirty-nine of the exposed athletes were classified as starters (23M, 16F), while the 
remaining 51 cases were classified as reserves (42M, 9F). Athletes were followed for an 
average of 80 days (Range = 35 – 90, SD = 15) due to 38 of the exposed athletes being 
returned to play less than a full 90 days due to the end of the season. The average period for 
return to play after concussion was 9 days (SD = 7).
The incidence of sustaining the outcome of interest (first time-loss lower extremity 
musculoskeletal injury) during the follow-up period was significantly higher in exposed 
athletes (45/90 or 50%), compared to non-exposed athletes (30/148 or 20%) (p < 0.01). A 
list of injuries observed in the athletes can be found in Table 2. Using univariate conditional 
logistic regression analysis, the odds of sustaining a lower extremity musculoskeletal injury 
was 3.39 times higher in exposed athletes compared to non-exposed (OR = 3.39; 95% CI = 
1.90, 6.05; p < 0.01). Median time lost after a lower extremity musculoskeletal injury was 
not significantly different between exposed athletes (9 days; range 1 – 261), compared to 
non-exposed athletes (15 days; range 3 – 213) (p = 0.41).
Secondary analyses were also performed by sex and starting status. Among male athletes, 
the odds of sustaining a lower extremity musculoskeletal injury was 3.72 times higher in 
athletes with concussion, (OR = 3.72; 95% CI = 1.84, 7.54; p < 0.01) whereas in female 
athletes, the odds of sustaining a lower extremity musculoskeletal injury was 2.75 times 
higher in athletes with concussion (OR = 2.75; 95% CI = 0.98, 7.69; p = 0.05). With respect 
to starting status, the odds of sustaining a lower extremity musculoskeletal injury was 2.84 
times higher in athletes with concussion (95% CI = 1.20, 6.71; p < 0.01), whereas among 
reserves, the odds of sustaining a lower extremity musculoskeletal injury was 3.90 times 
higher in athletes with concussion (OR = 3.90; 95% CI = 1.78, 8.54; p < 0.01).

 Discussion
We hypothesized that athletes who had been exposed to a concussion would be at higher 
odds for sustaining an in-season time-loss lower extremity musculoskeletal injury after 
return to play compared to matched non-exposed athletes. The study results indicated 
statistically significant odds of 3.39 for sustaining a lower extremity musculoskeletal injury 
in the concussed athletes, thus confirming the hypothesis. The main strength of this 
investigation is that it was designed as a historical cohort study, where exposed and non-
exposed athletes to concussion were matched by sport, position played, and starting status 
and followed in a prospective fashion. These results support previous studies which 
demonstrated an increased risk of musculoskeletal injury in players with a history of 
concussion [13–17]; however, as previously noted, three of these studies are limited in part 
by lacking controls for participation rates [13–15] and lacking a definitive temporal 
relationship between concussion and injury [15]. Hence, the results of this study add 
particular strength to the current literature as our study design controlled for both 
participation (in terms of starting status and position played) and established a clear 
temporal relationship between concussion and any subsequent lower extremity 
musculoskeletal injury. The studies by Lynall et. al. and Brooks et. al. also had similar 
features with respect to participation, with the latter being very similar in terms of design, 
follow-up, and statistical analysis. The odds ratio of 3.39 for the current study is high in 
comparison to Brooks et. al. (OR = 2.48). This could be due to differences in reporting 
injuries among players, institutional differences accounting for or defining time-loss, and/or 
difference in style of play or coaching (e.g. more/less contact practices and hitting drills).
We also hypothesized that the severity of injuries experienced would be greater in the 
athletes who had experienced a concussion. As the median number of days lost in training 
after sustaining a lower extremity musculoskeletal injury was not significantly different 
between the two groups, this hypothesis was rejected. The study size potentially limited our 
ability to test this hypothesis as the incidence of particularly severe injuries such as ACL 
ruptures was limited. Study designs featuring much larger sample sizes are needed to 
provide sufficient power to compare groups based on particular injury types and severities.
Although the number of females was limited relative to the males, this study is the first to 
our knowledge to report increased odds for sustaining an in-season time-loss lower 
extremity musculoskeletal injury after return to play from concussion specifically for female 
athletes. Previous studies have either been limited to male athletes [13, 15] or have used a 
mixed-sex cohort without reporting sex-specific risk [16]. Our results demonstrated an odds 
ratio for a lower extremity musculoskeletal injury of 2.75 for exposed female athletes 
compared to matched non-exposed female athletes, which was lower than the 3.72 odds ratio 
demonstrated by male athletes; however, the number of female athletes in this study was 
relatively limited and the study design was not adequate to make direct sex-based 
comparisons. We speculate that differences in the magnitude of the odds ratios between the 
sexes may be a function of sport played (football for males vs soccer, lacrosse, and 
basketball for females). Further research is needed to better characterize any differences in 
lower extremity musculoskeletal injury risk after concussion based on athlete sex. Care

 should be taken to make sex-based comparisons within sports using similar styles of play 
(e.g. soccer) as opposed to those using dissimilar styles of play (e.g. lacrosse).
The finding of an increased risk of musculoskeletal injuries after concussion may be due to 
persistent subclinical effects of concussion. Neuromuscular control may be directly impaired 
secondary to reduced excitability of the motor cortex. Prior studies on concussed athletes 
have noted reduced maximal voluntary muscle activation, motor evoked potential amplitude, 
and intra-cortical facilitation, as well as increased intracortical inhibition and motor evoked 
potential latencies [18–20]. Such alterations have been noted to potential persist well past 
the point of symptomatic resolution [21–23]. Maintaining optimal force-generating capacity 
throughout athletic activity is likely to be beneficial in reducing injury risk and improving 
functional performance. Altered motor cortex excitability has been observed in populations 
with a history of ACL injury, chronic ankle instability, and low back pain, and may be 
correlated with neuromuscular control and subject functionality [24–27]. In light of this 
evidence, it is possible that the elevated risk for lower extremity musculoskeletal injury 
observed in the concussed athletes may be mediated through changes in motor cortex 
function.
This increased risk may also be caused by persistent alterations in neurocognition. Athletes 
with low neurocognitive performance may not able to interpret environmental cues or 
anticipate the actions of opponents. This may inhibit their ability to create appropriate 
neuromuscular responses to perform an athletic maneuver in a safe manner, successfully 
dodge an opponent, or brace for a collision, thus leading to an elevated risk of injury [28]. 
Indeed, athletes who have experienced ACL injuries have previously been found to 
demonstrate significantly worse performance across all testing domains on a pre-season 
computer-based neurocognitive testing program compared to non-injured matched control 
athletes [29]. Poor reaction time on a pre-season computer-based neurocognitive test has 
also been demonstrated to be predictive of lower extremity strains and sprains in college 
football players [30].
A similar relationship may be playing a role in the relationship between concussion and 
subsequent musculoskeletal injury risk. Studies have indicated that there may be 
neurocognitive deficits from concussion that persist past the point of return to play [31, 32] 
that current clinical neurocognitive assessments may not be able to detect under current 
standard testing protocols [33, 34]. Similarly, there is a growing body of evidence that 
persistent neuromuscular performance impairments are present in concussed athletes during 
relatively simple gait tasks; furthermore, these impairments are more prominent when a 
concomitant dual-attention cognitive task is employed [3–9]. Although the criteria for return 
to play for athletes in this study and at many institutions include a return to baseline 
neurocognitive and balance measures, it is possible that subtle neurocognitive and 
neuromuscular impairments were present at the time of return to play. These neurocognitive 
and neuromuscular deficits are likely subtle and not easily detected with current assessment 
strategies, yet they may have a significant clinical impact on subsequent injury risk as such 
deficits are likely to be magnified with more challenging athletic tasks [28]. Hence, these 
deficits may create a “window of susceptibility” to musculoskeletal injury following return 
to play after concussion.

 The duration of this “window of susceptibility” to musculoskeletal injury is not well 
understood. It is interesting to note that the rate of injuries sustained after concussion as 
viewed by the approximate slope of the line in the survival plot (Figure 1) remained 
relatively constant through the 90 day follow-up period. This implies that the magnitude of 
risk for a musculoskeletal injury was similarly constant throughout this period, and suggests 
that the increased risk for injury may extend well beyond the 90 day follow-up period used 
in this study. This is in contrast to Cross et. al. who noted significantly shorter time to injury 
following return to play in concussed athletes (mean 53 days) compared to non-concussed 
athletes (mean 114 days) with a resulting curvilinear survival analysis plot [14]. On the other 
hand, Nordstrom et.al. noted a time-dependent elevation in risk of injury out to twelve 
months after a concussion, whereas Lynall et. al. detected a difference in injury risk between 
concussed and non-concussed athletes over 365 days but not over 90 or 180 days [13, 16]. 
This underscores the need to gain a better understanding of the duration of this elevated risk 
of injury and factors which may modify the magnitude of this effect.
The results of the current study may have implications for current practice standards 
regarding the evaluation and management of concussion. The presence of this “window of 
susceptibility” to musculoskeletal injury following concussion implies that current return to 
play guidelines may not be sufficient as currently designed to protect athletes from potential 
significant post-concussion sequelae. Musculoskeletal injury risk may need to be an item of 
consideration in the development of future guidelines. Current clinical tools may also be 
insensitive at detecting meaningful post-concussion deficits, or provide insufficient coverage 
of possible domains of effect (such as neuromuscular function). Continued development of 
clinical tests, potentially including novel testing paradigms incorporating measures of 
neuromuscular control, may be required to adequately assess athletes for suitability for 
return to play. Finally, post-concussion rehabilitation strategies may also need to be altered 
to account for this relationship. This may include incorporating aspects of neuromuscular-
based injury prevention strategies that have been used with evidence of success for reducing 
the risk of injuries such ankle sprains and ACL ruptures [35–37].
Limitations
The current study is not without its limitations. The data was collected at a single institution, 
which may limit the overall generalizability of the results. The study utilized historical data 
in a prospective design with a relatively small sample size. As such, comparisons of 
subsequent injury risk based on injury type or comparisons by sport or position were not 
feasible. The study also used a relatively short duration of observation after concussion 
injury, which limits our understanding of the possible duration of this increased risk of 
injury. Similarly, it is possible that this window of susceptibility has a very long duration, 
and as such our exclusion criteria of concussion within the prior six months may not be of 
sufficient duration. The duration of observation after return to play was not completely 
uniform across all athletes, with some cases censored short of the full 90 days due to the end 
of the season studied; however, this would likely reduce the magnitude of the difference in 
injury risk between the groups.

 Any effects of a history of prior lower extremity injury were not included in the current 
analysis. This decision was made due to multiple factors. One, we had a lack of reliable 
information on pre-collegiate injury history. There was also a lack of consensus on what 
would qualify as a meaningful prior injury history both in terms of the injury experienced 
and the historical timeframe for inclusion given our limited sample size and the breath of 
reported injuries. In light of these issues, prior injury history was not included in the 
analysis; however, we attempted to control for this factor in part by limiting our analysis to 
the first musculoskeletal injury experienced during the 90 day follow-up period. it is 
possible that our findings are somewhat amplified relative to these studies due to this 
missing factor, and future studies utilizing large sample sizes should certainly take this 
possible confounding factor into account.
Although the data was from a single institution with a single training protocol for injury 
documentation, it is possible that there were differences in injury documentation and 
reporting among the training room staff using the medical record system. There is a risk that 
athletes were misclassified as being exposed or non-exposed to concussion; however, due to 
the fact that all concussions were diagnosed by a sports medicine fellowship-trained 
physician, we feel it is unlikely that exposed athletes were misclassified. On the other hand, 
in light of the well-documented under-reporting of concussion symptoms among athletes we 
feel it is likely that some non-exposed athletes were potentially misclassified; the effect 
would likely result in a underestimation of the odds of experiencing a lower extremity 
musculoskeletal injury after concussion.
Conclusions
Athletes who have experienced a concussion are at an elevated risk for lower extremity 
musculoskeletal injury within the first 90 days after return to play. Future research is 
warranted to determine the duration of this risk; factors such as age, sport, or gender which 
may modify this risk; and methods by which this risk may be mitigated.

 Key Points
Athletes who experience a concussion may be at elevate risk for experiencing a 
lower extremity musculoskeletal injury after return to play.
This risk of lower extremity musculoskeletal injury may be elevated in both male 
and female athletes.
The duration of this elevated risk for lower extremity musculoskeletal injury is 
currently unknown and may extend beyond the end of the season during which the 
concussion occurred.
