Summary
Background—Smokers increasingly use e-cigarettes for many reasons, including attempts to 
quit combustible cigarettes and to use nicotine where smoking is prohibited. We aimed to assess 
the association between e-cigarette use and cigarette smoking cessation among adult cigarette 
smokers, irrespective of their motivation for using e-cigarettes.
Methods—PubMed and Web of Science were searched between April 27, 2015, and June 17, 
2015. Data extracted included study location, design, population, definition and prevalence of e-
cigarette use, comparison group (if applicable), cigarette consumption, level of nicotine 
dependence, other confounders, definition of quitting smoking, and odds of quitting smoking. The 
primary endpoint was cigarette smoking cessation. Odds of smoking cessation among smokers 
using e-cigarettes compared with smokers not using e-cigarettes were assessed using a random 
effects meta-analysis. A modification of the ACROBAT-NRSI tool and the Cochrane Risk of Bias 
Tool were used to assess bias. This meta-analysis is registered with PROSPERO (number 
CRD42015020382).
Findings—38 studies (of 577 studies identified) were included in the systematic review; all 20 
studies with control groups (15 cohort studies, three cross-sectional studies, and two clinical trials) 
were included in random effects meta-analysis and sensitivity analyses. Odds of quitting cigarettes 
were 28% lower in those who used e-cigarettes compared with those who did not use e-cigarettes 
(odds ratio [OR] 0·72, 95% CI 0·57–0·91). Association of e-cigarette use with quitting did not 
significantly differ among studies of all smokers using e-cigarettes (irrespective of interest in 
quitting cigarettes) compared with studies of only smokers interested in cigarette cessation (OR 
0·63, 95% CI 0·45–0·86 vs 0·86, 0·60–1·23; p=0·94). Other study characteristics (design, 
population, comparison group, control variables, time of exposure assessment, biochemical

 verification of abstinence, and definition of e-cigarette use) were also not associated with the 
overall effect size (p≥0·77 in all cases).
Interpretation—As currently being used, e-cigarettes are associated with significantly less 
quitting among smokers.
Introduction
E-cigarettes (also known as electronic cigarettes, electronic nicotine delivery systems, 
vapour pens, and many other terms) are battery-powered devices that heat a solution of 
humectants (usually propylene glycol or glycerol), nicotine (in most cases), and flavourings 
(in many cases), to deliver an aerosol that is inhaled by the user. E-cigarette use is increasing 
in many countries.1,2 Adults report various motivations for e-cigarette use, including to help 
them quit cigarettes and allowing them to continue to use nicotine in areas where smoking is 
prohibited,3–7 which are common themes in e-cigarette marketing and promotion.8–10
In 2015, the US Preventive Services Task Force concluded that evidence was insufficient to 
recommend e-cigarettes for tobacco cessation in adults because of conflicting and limited 
evidence available at the time the recommendation was prepared.11 Two meta-analyses of 
combined results from clinical trials have assessed whether e-cigarette use is associated with 
smoking cessation.12,13 The first,12 based on two randomised trials,14,15 concluded that 
participants using nicotine e-cigarettes were more likely to have abstained from smoking 
cigarettes for 6 months (relative risk 2·29, 95% CI 1·05–4·96) than were participants using 
no-nicotine e-cigarettes, although the authors had little confidence in the results because of 
the small number of trials and small sample sizes. The second,13 based on six studies (the 
same two randomised trials,14,15 two cohort studies,16,17 and two cross-sectional 
studies18,19) found the proportion of individuals using nicotine-containing e-cigarettes who 
quit cigarettes to be 20% (95% CI 11–28). These meta-analyses did not compare e-cigarette 
users to a control group not using e-cigarettes. A third meta-analysis20 of five population-
level studies (four longitudinal21–24 and one cross-sectional25) found that e-cigarette use 
was associated with a significant depression in smoking cessation (odds ratio [OR] 0·61, 
95% CI 0·50–0·75).
The different results of the meta-analyses of clinical trials and observational studies may 
relate to discrepancies in how e-cigarettes are used in a controlled study setting versus in the 
real world. Clinical trials evaluating a treatment or intervention under ideal conditions may 
differ from observational studies evaluating how a product is actually used in a real-world 
setting in study design, study population, study environment,26 and ability to control for 
potential confounders, which can compromise the generalisability of results of observational 
studies.27 These differences are potentially important for e-cigarettes, which, unlike 
prescription-only nicotine inhalers, are mass-marketed consumer products. We conducted a 
systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials and observational real-world studies to 
assess the association between e-cigarettes (as available and used) and cigarette smoking 
cessation among adults, including all smokers as well as only those interested in quitting 
smoking.

 Panel: Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed and Web of Science between April 27, 2015, and June 17, 2015, 
for articles that evaluated the association between e-cigarette use and cigarette smoking 
cessation among adult cigarette smokers. All relevant papers were included, irrespective 
of where the research was conducted or quality of the studies. There were no language 
restrictions, although all the papers were written in English. We included two additional 
studies published while this report was under peer review. Two earlier meta-analyses, 
one based on two randomised trials, and another based on six studies (the same two 
randomised trials plus two cohort studies and two cross-sectional studies), suggested that 
e-cigarettes might assist smokers in quitting cigarettes. These meta-analyses did not 
compare e-cigarette users to a control group not using e-cigarettes. The first meta-
analysis (of two randomised trials) concluded that participants using nicotine e-cigarettes 
were more likely to have abstained from smoking cigarettes for at least 6 months (relative 
risk 2·29, 95% CI 1·05–4·96) than were participants using no-nicotine e-cigarettes. The 
second meta-analysis concluded that the proportion of individuals using nicotine-
containing e-cigarettes who quit cigarettes to be 20% (95% CI 11–28). A third meta-
analysis of five population-level observational studies found that e-cigarette use was 
associated with a significant depression in smoking cessation.
Added value of this study
We include all available (38) studies in our systematic review and all 20 studies with 
control groups (15 cohort studies, three cross-sectional studies, and two clinical trials) in 
our meta-analysis. Odds of quitting cigarettes were 28% lower in those who used e-
cigarettes compared with those who did not use e-cigarettes (odds ratio 0·72, 95% CI 
0·57–0·91). Sensitivity analysis showed that the results were not affected by a wide range 
of study design factors.
Implications of all the available evidence
As currently being used, e-cigarettes are associated with significantly less quitting among 
smokers. According to the results of our systematic review and meta-analysis, e-
cigarettes should not be recommended as effective smoking cessation aids until there is 
evidence that, as promoted and used, they assist smoking cessation.
Methods
Data sources and searches
To identify studies, we began by manually searching the references from the three earlier 
meta-analyses12,13,20 and completed a comprehensive literature search of PubMed and the 
Web of Science Core Collection between April 27, 2015, and June 17, 2015. As detailed in 
the appendix, search terms included “electronic cigarette”, “e-cigarette”, “electronic nicotine 
delivery”, “stop”, “quit”, “cessation”, “abstain”, and “abstinence”. Search results were not 
limited by language, but all identified studies were in English. There was no search 
limitation on publication dates. We continued to monitor the scientific literature after

 completing the formal search; this report includes two studies that were published while it 
was in initial peer review.28,29 Both abstracts and full manuscripts were considered.
Study selection
One investigator (SK) did the search, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment, which was 
subsequently reviewed by a second investigator (SAG). Clinical trials, whether randomised 
and controlled or not, cohort studies, and cross-sectional studies were all considered. We 
included studies that evaluated the relationship between e-cigarette use and cigarette 
smoking cessation among adult cigarette smokers; therefore, two studies on adolescents 
were excluded.30,31 We considered all study populations that were defined as “adult” by the 
study authors (youngest age varied from 15 to 30 years in the studies that defined “adult”; 
detailed descriptions of each article are provided in the appendix). We included studies of 
participants who were interested in quitting cigarette smoking and studies of all smokers 
irrespective of interest in quitting. We excluded one cross-sectional study25 because the 
primary outcome was e-cigarette use, not smoking cessation.
Data extraction
Studies that included cigarette smoking cessation as a primary outcome were evaluated for 
inclusion. The definitions of cigarette smoking cessation included in this systematic review 
and meta-analysis included both self-reported abstinence from smoking cigarettes and 
biochemically-validated measures of abstinence (eg, cotinine or exhaled carbon monoxide 
measurements). All studies were included irrespective of the duration of abstinence from 
cigarettes. Those who quit cigarettes could have still been using e-cigarettes; quitting e-
cigarettes was not used as an outcome.
Data extracted from each study included study location, design, population, definition and 
prevalence of e-cigarette use, comparison group (if applicable), cigarette consumption, level 
of nicotine dependence, other confounders measured, definition of quitting smoking, and 
odds of quitting smoking. We attempted to contact study investigators for missing 
information. Risk of bias was assessed using a modification of the ACROBAT-NRSI tool32 
for observational studies and the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool33 for clinical trials, 
implemented as detailed in the appendix.
Data synthesis
For studies comparing nicotine e-cigarettes with nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), no-
nicotine e-cigarettes, or no cessation aid, all ORs are presented; when several ORs were 
provided, we included only the comparison with no e-cigarette use (when available) or no 
cessation aid in the meta-analysis. Adjusted ORs were used when available, otherwise 
unadjusted ORs were used. For one cohort study,7 two different ORs were reported for e-
cigarette users of different intensities and a pooled estimate was not provided; the ORs for 
those two groups are presented separately.
Statistical analysis
We computed pooled estimates of the odds of smoking cessation among smokers using e-
cigarettes compared with smokers not using e-cigarettes using a random effects meta-

 analysis with the metan command in Stata version 13.0. Adjusted ORs were used when 
available, with unadjusted ORs for the remaining studies in the meta-analysis. Statistical 
heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic.
We did a sensitivity analysis of the effects of study type (real world vs clinical), longitudinal 
versus cross-sectional data analysis, sample frame (smokers interested in quitting vs all 
smokers), control group (NRT users vs all no-e-cigarette users), study population (mental 
illness or no mental illness), whether the study controlled for level of nicotine dependence, 
time of e-cigarette assessment (whether e-cigarette use was assessed at baseline or follow-up 
in longitudinal studies), whether abstinence was biochemically defined, and whether the 
definition of e-cigarette use was current (past 30 day) use versus ever-use or not within the 
past 30 days on the results using separate random effects meta-regressions with each factor 
entered as a dummy variable with the Stata metareg command. We considered the nine 
sensitivity analyses to be a family of comparisons and controlled for multiple comparisons 
using the Holm-Sidak method to obtain adjusted p values. We tested for the presence of 
publication bias using a funnel plot and Egger’s test.
The meta-analysis was registered with PROSPERO on May 11, 2015, number 
CRD42015020382.

Results
Of 577 studies identified, 38 were included in the systematic review (appendix) and 20 
(table 1) in the meta-analysis. Studies excluded from the systematic review did not include 
smoking cessation as an outcome, did not include adults as the study population, were 
opinion pieces or commentaries, or were review articles (figure 1). Of the 38 studies 
included in the systematic review, 16 were excluded from the meta-analysis because they 
lacked a control group that did not use e-cigarettes,15–17,19,45–56 and two57,58 were excluded 
because they used the same dataset as another study included in the meta-analysis.14,38 15 of 
the studies included in the meta-analysis were longitudinal cohort studies (ten assessed e-
cigarette use at baseline, five assessed e-cigarette use only at follow-up), three were cross-
sectional studies, and two were clinical trials.
Odds of quitting (only provided for studies with a control group) are described with point 
estimates and 95% CIs and whether these point estimates differed significantly from 1·00.
15 longitudinal real-world studies assessing smoking cessation in e-cigarette users compared 
with those who did not use e-cigarettes.7,21–24,34–43 Point estimates in 13 of the 15 studies 
indicated decreased smoking cessation among those who used e-cigarettes, six of which 
reported statistically significant results.24,34,36,40,41,43 One study7 found that intensive e-

 cigarette users (those who used e-cigarettes daily for at least 1 month) had significantly 
increased smoking cessation and that intermittent e-cigarette users had a non-significant 
decrease in smoking cessation. In three studies without control groups (excluded from the 
meta-analysis),16,45,46 smoking cessation rates among e-cigarette users ranged from 17% at 
8 weeks,45 to 41% at 1 year,46 to 46% at 1 year.16
Three cross-sectional studies compared e-cigarette users to those who did not use e-
cigarettes:18,28,44 two28,44 showed significantly lower smoking cessation among smokers 
using e-cigarettes compared with those who did not, and the other study18 (of smokers who 
had made a quit attempt in the past year) found significantly higher smoking cessation in 
those who used e-cigarettes compared with those who used NRT or no smoking cessation 
aid. Cigarette quit rates in cross-sectional studies that included only e-cigarette users (ie, 
studies without control groups, which were excluded from the meta-analysis) ranged from 
10% to 66%.19,47–49
The one randomised controlled trial comparing cigarette quit rates of e-cigarette users with 
those of NRT users showed a non-significant increase in quitting associated with e-cigarette 
use.14 A secondary analysis of a subset of participants with mental illness in this study 
showed a non-significant decrease in quitting among those who used e-cigarettes compared 
with those who used NRT.58 A non-randomised clinical trial found a non-significant 
increase in quitting among individuals electing to use e-cigarettes for smoking cessation 
compared with those not using e-cigarettes.29 For trials without control groups17,50–56 (ie, 
all participants used e-cigarettes), cigarette quit rates ranged from 12·5% to more than 40%. 
A randomised trial comparing users of e-cigarettes with and without nicotine (without a 
control group of non-e-cigarette users or conventional smoking cessation therapy) found a 
non-significant increase in quitting cigarettes for those using nicotine-containing e-cigarettes 
compared with those using non-nicotine e-cigarettes.15
Combining the 18 real-world studies7,18,21–24,28,34–44 (treating one study7 with estimates for 
two types of e-cigarette users as two studies, yielded 19 real-world estimates of the 
relationship between e-cigarette use and quitting smoking) and the two clinical trials14,29 in 
a random effects meta-analysis (figures 2, 3) indicated that the odds of quitting smoking 
were 28% lower in those who used e-cigarettes compared with those who did not use e-
cigarettes (OR 0·72, 95% CI 0·57–0·91).
Studies that included only smokers interested in quitting cigarettes yielded a pooled OR for 
quitting of 0·86 (0·60–1·23) for those using e-cigarettes compared with those not using e-
cigarettes. Studies of all smokers (irrespective of motivation to quit) yielded a pooled OR of 
0·63 (0·45–0·86), which is not significantly different from studies limited to smokers 
interested in quitting (p=0·94).
All of the observational studies had low risk of selection bias, half (nine of 18) controlled for 
confounders, and seven of 15 longitudinal studies had follow-up periods of at least 6 months 
(appendix). The overall risk of bias from exposure measurement was unclear, given that the 
definition of e-cigarette use in all but two7,39 of the studies could have included people who

 only used e-cigarettes once; risk of bias from outcome assessment was unclear or high due 
to objective or poorly defined measurements.
The one randomised clinical trial14 had a low risk of selection, detection, and reporting bias, 
but a high risk of performance and attrition bias, because participants randomly assigned to 
e-cigarettes were provided with the e-cigarettes, whereas the individuals randomly assigned 
to nicotine patches were provided a voucher that they could take to a pharmacy to obtain the 
patches; additionally, the nicotine patch group had a higher loss to follow-up than did the e-
cigarette group (appendix). The non-randomised controlled trial29 had low risk of detection, 
attrition, and reporting bias, but high risk of selection and performance bias because 
participants were not randomised and had chosen to use e-cigarettes.
We did not find evidence of publication bias by Egger’s test (p=0·91) or by visualisation of 
the funnel plot (appendix).
There was evidence of heterogeneity of the studies (I2 77·4%, p<0·0005). In particular, 
heterogeneity was higher for the cross-sectional studies (I2 94·4%, p<0·0005) than the 
longitudinal studies (I2 61·5%, p<0·0005). In addition to using a random effects model to 
control for heterogeneity, we assessed the possible reasons for heterogeneity in a sensitivity 
analysis (table 2). In the sensitivity analyses, sample frame, study type (longitudinal vs 
cross-sectional data analysis), control group, study population, level of nicotine dependence, 
time of e-cigarette assessment (in longitudinal studies), biochemical verification of smoking 
cessation, and definition of e-cigarette use were not associated with overall effect size 
(p≥0·77 in all cases).
Discussion
In this systematic review and meta-analysis, pooled results from 18 real-world observational 
studies and two clinical trials showed 28% (OR 0·72, 95% CI 0·57–0·91) lower odds of 
cigarette smoking cessation among those who used or had used e-cigarettes compared with 
those who had not used e-cigarettes. This conclusion was insensitive to a wide range of 
study design factors, including whether or not the study population consisted only of 
smokers interested in smoking cessation, or all smokers (irrespective of quit intention).
The results of this meta-analysis are consistent with those of the previous meta-analysis of 
five real-world studies,20 which found a pooled OR for quitting of 0·61 (95% CI 0·50–0·75) 
for those who used e-cigarettes compared with those who did not use e-cigarettes.
By contrast, two previous meta-analyses,12,13 which both included the same two clinical 
trials to compare nicotine e-cigarette users with non-nicotine e-cigarette users,14,15 showed 
the odds of quitting cigarettes to be twice as high in those using e-cigarettes with nicotine 
compared with those using e-cigarette without nicotine (2·29, 95% CI 1·05–4·96).12 One of 
the previous meta-analyses,13 based on six studies, found that 20% (95% CI 11–28) of users 
of nicotine-containing e-cigarettes went on to quit cigarettes. By contrast with our analysis, 
the estimates did not include a comparison to standard therapy or no e-cigarette use, so they 
cannot be used to determine whether e-cigarettes are associated with greater cigarette 
abstinence than current practice.

 So far, no clinical trials have done a true head-to-head comparison of e-cigarettes with 
standard therapies (ie, nicotine patch, gum, or inhaler) approved by the US Food and Drug 
Administration for smoking cessation. The one randomised clinical trial included in this 
meta-analysis14 compared e-cigarettes with nicotine patches, but was subject to performance 
bias because individuals randomly assigned to e-cigarettes were provided with them by the 
investigators, whereas participants randomly assigned to NRT were given only a voucher 
that they could redeem at a pharmacy to obtain NRT patches. Although this practice is 
consistent with standard care in the country in which the study was done (New Zealand), it 
potentially biases the study against NRT. As a result, true head-to-head comparisons of e-
cigarettes with approved therapies in a clinical setting are needed to evaluate the usefulness 
of e-cigarettes for smoking cessation. In the USA, such studies require Investigational New 
Drug approval from the Food and Drug Administration Center for Drug Evaluation and 
Research. If e-cigarette companies do not request this approval (as has been the case to 
date), such studies will be difficult, if not impossible, to conduct, unless at the request of the 
companies.
Heterogeneity was higher for the cross-sectional studies (I2 94·4%, p<0·0005) than the 
longitudinal studies (I2 61·5%, p<0·0005). This increased heterogeneity might result from 
the fact that there were only three cross-sectional studies (compared with 18 longitudinal 
estimates), and that they differed in terms of countries (one in the UK18 and two in the 
USA28,44), study population (two only of smokers interested in quitting,18,28 one of all 
smokers44), comparator group (one compared e-cigarettes with NRT18 and the other two 
compared with no e-cigarette use28,44), and adjustment for nicotine dependence (one18 was 
adjusted, two28,44 were not). There was no evidence of study type (longitudinal vs cross-
sectional) being associated with the overall effect size.
There could be a number of explanations for why e-cigarette use was associated with less 
quitting in this meta-analysis combining observational and clinical studies. When 
considering e-cigarettes as a potential smoking cessation aid, the fact that they are freely 
available consumer products could be important. The situation may be similar to the 
differences between the clinical efficacy of approved NRT therapies for smoking cessation 
in clinical trials versus actual use in non-clinical settings. A few studies have evaluated the 
association of other forms of over-the-counter nicotine with smoking cessation. Data from 
the large population-based California Tobacco Surveys, showed that NRT was associated 
with long-term success in quitting cigarettes when available by prescription only, but this 
association was lost when NRT became available over the counter.59 In a prospective cohort 
study of adult smokers in England, prescription medication combined with behavioural 
counselling was associated with increased smoking cessation, whereas over-the-counter 
NRT was associated with a significant reduction in smoking cessation (OR 0·68, 95% CI 
0·49–0·94) that was similar to the association between e-cigarette use and quitting smoking 
that we observed.60
In observational studies evaluating e-cigarette use, participants are choosing to use e-
cigarettes unlike clinical trials where they are being randomly assigned to receive them. 
From one perspective, this self-selection of product use by individuals would be a potential 
source of selection bias61 when evaluating e-cigarettes as a smoking cessation aid. However

 e-cigarettes are not being used just as smoking cessation devices in the real world. Indeed, 
one important motivation for using e-cigarettes is to self-administer nicotine in places where 
smoking is prohibited.3,62
Interest in quitting cigarette smoking is a common reason for using e-cigarettes,3,4 probably 
because claims of efficacy as a cessation aid have appeared in e-cigarette advertisements in 
the USA,9 UK,8 and China10 even though such claims had not been accepted by regulatory 
authorities. E-cigarettes are also marketed as a way to circumvent smoke-free policies,8,9 
and could be used as such by nicotine-dependent individuals who have lower baseline 
intentions of quitting.
Subgroup analyses in two of the studies suggest that specific use patterns may be important. 
Biener and colleagues7 found that intermittent e-cigarette users (more than once or twice but 
less than daily use) were less likely to quit smoking one year later than non-e-cigarette users, 
but those who had used e-cigarettes daily for at least one month were significantly more 
likely to quit cigarettes. Similarly, Hitchman and colleagues38 found that all “cig-alike” 
users and non-daily tank system users had lower odds of quitting cigarettes, whereas daily 
tank system users were significantly more likely to quit. By contrast, Manzoli and 
colleagues39 found a non-significant (OR 0·83, 95% CI 0·53–1·29) reduction in quitting 
cigarettes among cigarette smokers who regularly used e-cigarettes (defined as using both 
cigarettes and e-cigarettes within the same week for 6 months) compared with cigarette-only 
smokers. These data suggest that e-cigarette use patterns might be important in the 
association between e-cigarettes and smoking cessation.
E-cigarette regulation has the potential to influence marketing and reasons for use. The 
inclusion of e-cigarettes in smoke-free laws and voluntary smoke-free policies could help 
decrease use of e-cigarettes as a cigarette substitute and, perhaps, increase their effectiveness 
for smoking cessation. The way e-cigarettes are available on the market—for use by anyone 
and for any purpose—creates a disconnect between the provision of e-cigarettes for 
cessation as part of a monitored clinical trial and the availability of e-cigarettes for use by 
the general population. Therefore, careful attention to how the products are marketed and 
actually used will be necessary in evaluating e-cigarettes as a smoking cessation aid and 
their ultimate public health impact.63
The studies we reviewed controlled for many confounding variables, including level of 
nicotine dependence, whether the subject was trying to quit smoking cigarettes, 
demographics, past quit attempts, medical and psychiatric comorbidities, cigarette 
consumption, intention or motivation to quit, study factors, tobacco-related variables and 
behaviours, alcohol use, sensation seeking, number of friends and family who smoke, use of 
other quit methods, and type of tobacco smoked (table 1). Future research should focus on 
determining standard definitions of e-cigarette use; evaluating the association of different 
extents of use and different devices with smoking cessation; conducting more randomised 
clinical trials comparing e-cigarettes to standard therapies such as NRT; evaluating the 
effect of e-cigarette use on factors such as motivation to quit; and distinguishing e-cigarette 
users by their reasons for using the products. An ideal study (whether a clinical trial or 
observational study) would control for all these variables, and be a longitudinal study that

 assessed e-cigarette use at both the start and end, including product type used and frequency 
of use. Additionally, having clear definitions of e-cigarette use (ever use, past 30 day use, 
whether experimentation with e-cigarettes once or twice are included) is important, as is 
how cessation is defined. It will, unfortunately, likely be difficult to obtain all these details 
in any one study.
This study is subject to eight limitations. First, given that there have been very few 
controlled clinical trials exploring e-cigarette use for smoking cessation; all but two of the 
studies used in this meta-analysis were observational studies. Second, the definition of 
smoking cessation used in the studies included in the meta-analysis varied in terms of length 
of abstinence from cigarettes and how smoking cessation was defined. Because we aimed 
for a comprehensive review, we included all definitions of quit as defined by the authors. 
Third, most—but not all—of the observational studies controlled for confounders such as 
nicotine dependence. Sensitivity analysis showed that controlling for nicotine dependence 
was not associated with overall effect size. Other potential confounding variables were 
controlled for in some of the studies, however, sensitivity analyses could not be conducted 
on each of these variables. Nevertheless, it is always possible that other unidentified 
confounders, including biases introduced by those who self-selected to use e-cigarettes, 
might affect the results. Fourth, only two studies7,39 assessed the extent of e-cigarette use in 
their analyses. It is possible that in some included studies, e-cigarettes were only used once, 
which would not be a good predictor of smoking cessation. Fifth, there was variability in the 
quality of the studies. We included them all to provide a comprehensive review of the 
literature and avoid concerns that the results of the analysis were affected by bias in 
selecting which studies to exclude and include. The sensitivity analysis showed that the 
results of the meta-analysis were insensitive to a wide range of aspects of study design. 
Sixth, in the cross-sectional studies, e-cigarette use and cessation were assessed at the same 
time, raising concerns about recall bias. Seventh, e-cigarettes are rapidly evolving products 
and different types and generations of e-cigarettes may have different effects in terms of 
cessation. Finally, both e-cigarette products and the marketing and regulatory environment 
are rapidly evolving, all of which could affect the relationship between e-cigarette use and 
quitting smoking.
As use patterns and product types continue to evolve, the association between e-cigarettes 
and cigarette quit rates may change. In the current regulatory environment, e-cigarette use is 
increasing and, although quitting smoking is a common marketing claim and is often cited as 
a reason for use among cigarette smokers, the overall conclusion from the available studies 
is that e-cigarette use is associated with reduced smoking cessation in the real world.
