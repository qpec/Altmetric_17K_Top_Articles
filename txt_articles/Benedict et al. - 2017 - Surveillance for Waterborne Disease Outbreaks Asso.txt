Provision of safe water in the United States is vital to pro-
tecting public health (1). Public health agencies in the U.S. 
states and territories* report information on waterborne disease 
outbreaks to CDC through the National Outbreak Reporting 
System (NORS) (https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/surveil-
lance/index.html). During 2013–2014, 42 drinking water–
associated† outbreaks were reported, accounting for at least 
1,006 cases of illness, 124 hospitalizations, and 13 deaths. 
Legionella was associated with 57% of these outbreaks and all of 
the deaths. Sixty-nine percent of the reported illnesses occurred 
in four outbreaks in which the etiology was determined to be 
either a chemical or toxin or the parasite Cryptosporidium. 
Drinking water contamination events can cause disruptions 
in water service, large impacts on public health, and persistent 
community concern about drinking water quality. Effective 
water treatment and regulations can protect public drink-
ing water supplies in the United States, and rapid detection, 
identification of the cause, and response to illness reports can 
reduce the transmission of infectious pathogens and harmful 
chemicals and toxins.
To provide information about drinking water–associated 
waterborne disease outbreaks in the United States in which 
the first illness occurred in 2013 or 2014 (https://www.cdc.
gov/healthywater/surveillance/drinking-surveillance-reports.
html), CDC analyzed outbreaks reported to the CDC 
Waterborne Disease and Outbreak Surveillance System 
through NORS (https://www.cdc.gov/nors/about.html) as of 
December 31, 2015. For an event to be defined as a water-
borne disease outbreak, two or more cases must be linked 
epidemiologically by time, location of water exposure, and 
illness characteristics; and the epidemiologic evidence must 
implicate water exposure as the probable source of illness. 
Data requested for each outbreak include 1) the number 
of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths; 2) the etiologic agent 
(confirmed or suspected); 3) the implicated water system; 
* Outbreak reports can be submitted by public health agencies in the U.S states, 
District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, Marshall Islands, Federated States 
of Micronesia, Northern Mariana Islands, Palau, and U.S. Virgin Islands.
† Drinking water, also called potable water, is water for human consumption 
(e.g., drinking, bathing, showering, hand-washing, teeth brushing, food 
preparation, dishwashing, and maintaining oral hygiene) and includes water 
collected, treated, stored, or distributed in public and individual water systems, 
as well as bottled water.
4) the setting of exposure; and 5) relevant epidemiologic 
and environmental data needed to understand the outbreak 
occurrences and for determining the deficiency classifica-
tion.§ One previously unreported outbreak with onset date 
of first illness in 2012 is presented but is not included in 
the analysis of outbreaks that occurred during 2013–2014.
Public health officials from 19 states reported 42 outbreaks 
associated with drinking water during the surveillance period 
(Table 1) (https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/surveillance/
drinking-water-tables-figures.html). These outbreaks resulted 
in at least 1,006 cases of illness, 124 hospitalizations (12% of 
cases), and 13 deaths. At least one etiologic agent was identi-
fied in 41 (98%) outbreaks. Counts of etiologic agents in 
this report include both confirmed and suspected etiologies, 
which differs from previous surveillance reports. Legionella was 
implicated in 24 (57%) outbreaks, 130 (13%) cases, 109 (88%) 
hospitalizations, and all 13 deaths (Table 1). Eight outbreaks 
caused by two parasites resulted in 289 (29%) cases, among 
which 279 (97%) were caused by Cryptosporidium, and 10 
(3%) were caused by Giardia duodenalis. Chemicals or toxins 
were implicated in four outbreaks involving 499 cases, with 
13 hospitalizations, including the first reported outbreaks 
(two outbreaks) associated with algal toxins in drinking water.
The most commonly reported outbreak etiology was 
Legionella (57%), making acute respiratory illness the most 
common predominant illness type reported in outbreaks 
(Table 2). Thirty-five (83%) outbreaks were associated with 
public (i.e., regulated), community or noncommunity water 
systems,¶ and three (7%) were associated with unregulated, 
§ Waterborne disease outbreaks are assigned one or more deficiency classifications 
based on available data. The deficiencies provide information regarding how 
the water became contaminated, characteristics of the water system, and factors 
leading to waterborne disease outbreaks. Outbreaks are assigned one or more 
deficiency classifications based on available data. https://www.cdc.gov/
healthywater/surveillance/deficiency-classification.html.
¶ Community and noncommunity water systems are public water systems that 
have ≥15 service connections or serve an average of ≥25 residents for ≥60 days 
per year. A community water system serves year-round residents of a community, 
subdivision, or mobile home park. A noncommunity water system serves an 
institution, industry, camp, park, hotel, or business and can be nontransient 
or transient. Nontransient systems serve ≥25 of the same persons for ≥6 months 
of the year but not year-round (e.g., factories and schools) whereas transient 
systems provide water to places in which persons do not remain for long periods 
of time (e.g., restaurants, highway rest stations, and parks). Individual water 
systems are small systems not owned or operated by a water utility that have 
<15 connections or serve <25 persons.

†† Classification of all reported Giardia cases has changed from Giardia intestinalis to Giardia duodenalis to align with laboratory standards.
 
§§ Setting is listed as “other” because implicated facility houses both independent living and assisted living facilities.
 
¶¶ This count was not included in the analysis of the current report. This outbreak occurred in 2012 and was not reported in the previous drinking water outbreak report.
 *** Patients’ methemoglobin levels ranged from 1.6% to 32.3%. Water was determined to be the source rather than food because all cases had direct exposure to 
water. Of the 14 cases, five used the water to make oatmeal or cream of wheat.
 ††† This report includes both community and hospital-associated cases (27 of 45 patients reported health care/hospital exposure).
 §§§ This is the first drinking water–associated outbreak of this etiology reported to the National Outbreak Reporting System.
 ¶¶¶ Microcystin was detected in finished water sampled from a community water system; levels exceeded state thresholds and resulted in a “Do not drink” advisory.
 
**** Cryptosporidium was detected in water samples but not in any clinical specimens.
 †††† This system was registered as a community system as a result of the outbreak investigation.

However, individual levels of exposure could not be quantified in clinical specimens. Propylene glycol phenyl ether was also present in the spill at low concentrations.
individual systems. Fourteen outbreaks occurred in drinking 
water systems with groundwater sources and an additional 
14 occurred in drinking water systems with surface water 
sources. The most commonly cited deficiency, which led to 
24** (57%) of the 42 drinking water–associated outbreaks, 
was the presence of Legionella in drinking water systems. In 
addition, 143 (14%) cases were associated with seven (17%) 
outbreak reports that had a deficiency classification indicating 
“unknown or insufficient information.”
Among 1,006 cases attributed to drinking water–associated 
outbreaks, 50% of the reported cases were associated with 
chemical or toxin exposure, 29% were caused by parasitic 
infection (either Cryptosporidium or Giardia), and 13% were 
caused by Legionella infection (Table 2). Seventy-five percent 
of cases were linked to community water systems. Outbreaks 
in water systems supplied solely by surface water accounted for 
most cases (79%). Of the 1,006 cases, 86% originated from

outbreaks in which the predominant illness was acute gastro-
intestinal illness. Three (7%) outbreaks in which treatment 
was not expected to remove the contaminant were associated 
with a chemical or toxin and resulted in 48% of all outbreak-
associated cases.
Discussion
Water treatment processes, regulations, and rapid response to 
illness outbreaks continue to reduce the transmission of patho-
gens, reduce exposure to chemicals and toxins, and protect the 
public drinking water supplies in the United States. Outbreaks 
reported during this surveillance period include the first reports 
of drinking water–associated outbreaks caused by harmful 
algal blooms as well as the continued challenges of preventing 
and controlling illnesses and outbreaks caused by Legionella 
and Cryptosporidium. Outbreaks in community water systems 
caused by chemical spills (West Virginia) (2), harmful algal 
blooms (Ohio), Cryptosporidium (Oregon) (3), and Legionella 
(Michigan) demonstrated that diverse contaminants can cause

interruptions in water service, illnesses, and persistent com-
munity concern about drinking water quality. Outbreaks in 
community water systems can trigger large and complex public 
health responses because of their potential for causing com-
munitywide illness and decreasing the availability of safe water 
for community members, businesses, and critical services (e.g., 
hospitals). These outbreaks highlight the importance of public 
health and water utility preparedness for emergencies related 
to contamination from pathogens, chemicals, and toxins.
Legionella continues to be the most frequently reported 
etiology among drinking water–associated outbreaks (4). All 
of the outbreak-associated deaths reported during this surveil-
lance period as well as all of the outbreaks reported in hospital/
health care settings or long-term care facilities, were caused 
by Legionella. A review of 27 Legionnaires’ disease outbreak 
investigations in which CDC participated during 2000–2014 
identified at least one water system maintenance deficiency 
in all 23 investigations for which this information was avail-
able, indicating that effective water management programs 
in buildings at increased risk for Legionella growth and trans-
mission (e.g., those with more than 10 stories or that house 
susceptible populations) can reduce the risk for Legionnaires’ 
disease (5,6). Although Legionella was detected in drinking 
water, multiple routes of transmission beyond ingestion of 
contaminated water more likely contributed to these outbreaks, 
such as aerosolization from domestic or environmental sources. 
Cryptosporidium was the second most common cause of both 
outbreaks and illnesses, demonstrating the continued threat 
from this chlorine-tolerant pathogen when drinking water 
supplies are contaminated. Existing drinking water regulations 
and filtration systems targeted to control Cryptosporidium 
help protect public health in community water systems that 
are primarily served by surface water sources or groundwater 
sources under the influence of surface water (7). Through the 
Epidemiology and Laboratory Capacity for Infectious Diseases 
(ELC) Cooperative Agreement, CDC has recently begun a 
laboratory-based cryptosporidiosis surveillance system in the 
United States, CryptoNet, to better track Cryptosporidium 
transmission and rapidly identify outbreak sources through 
molecular typing (8). The cyanobacterial toxin microcystin 
caused the largest reported toxin contamination of community 
drinking water in August 2013 and September 2014 and was 
responsible for extensive community and water disruptions. 
In June 2015, the Environmental Protection Agency released 
specific health advisory guidance for microcystin concentra-
tions in drinking water (9). The contamination of a community 
drinking water supply with 4-metholcyclohexanementanol 
(MCHM) also illustrates the importance of source water 
protection from chemicals and toxins (2).
The findings in this report are subject to at least three limita-
tions. First, 17% of drinking water–associated outbreak reports 
could not be assigned a specific deficiency classification other 
than “unknown or insufficient information,” because of a lack 
of information. Furthermore, the deficiency classification most 
frequently reported (“presence of Legionella in drinking water 
systems”) does not provide insight into the specific factors 
contributing to Legionella amplification and transmission. 
Second, the detection and investigation of outbreaks might be 
incomplete. Because of universal exposure to water, linking ill-
ness to drinking water is inherently difficult through traditional 
outbreak investigation methods (e.g., case-control and cohort 
studies) (10). Finally, reporting capabilities and requirements 
vary among states and localities. Therefore, outbreak surveil-
lance data likely underestimate actual occurrence of outbreaks 
and should not be used to estimate the actual number of 
outbreaks or cases of waterborne disease.
Public health surveillance is necessary to detect waterborne 
disease and outbreaks, and to continue to monitor health trends 
associated with drinking water exposure. Despite resource 
constraints, 19 states reported drinking water–associated 
outbreaks for 2013–2014 compared with 14 for the previous 
reporting period (4). In this reporting cycle, more reported 
outbreaks and cases were caused by parasites and chemicals 
than by non-Legionella bacteria, and more cases were reported 
from community systems than from individual systems. Most 
of the outbreaks and illnesses reported in this period were in 
community systems, which serve larger numbers of persons; 
outbreaks in these systems can sicken entire communities. 
Although individual, private water systems likely serve fewer 
persons than community systems, they can still result in rela-
tively large numbers of illnesses. One outbreak reported during 
2013–2014 in an individual system led to 100 estimated ill-
nesses associated with a wedding. The public health challenges 
highlighted here underscore the need for rapid detection, 
identification of the cause, and response when drinking water 
is contaminated by infectious pathogens, chemicals, or toxins 
to prevent and control waterborne illness and outbreaks.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Waterborne disease and outbreaks associated with drinking 
water continue to occur in the United States. CDC collects data 
on waterborne disease outbreaks submitted from all states and 
territories through the National Outbreak Reporting System.
What is added by this report?
During 2013–2014, a total of 42 drinking water–associated 
outbreaks were reported to CDC, resulting in at least 1,006 cases 
of illness, 124 hospitalizations, and 13 deaths. Legionella was 
responsible for 57% of outbreaks and 13% of illnesses, and 
chemicals/toxins and parasites together accounted for 29% of 
outbreaks and 79% of illnesses. Eight outbreaks caused by 
parasites resulted in 289 (29%) cases, among which 279 (97%) 
were caused by Cryptosporidium and 10 (3%) were caused by 
Giardia duodenalis. Chemicals or toxins were implicated in four 
outbreaks involving 499 cases, with 13 hospitalizations, 
including the first outbreaks associated with algal toxins.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Continued public health surveillance is necessary to detect 
waterborne disease and monitor health trends associated with 
drinking water exposure. When drinking water is contaminated 
by infectious pathogens, chemicals, or toxins, public health 
agencies need to provide rapid detection, identification of the 
cause, and response to prevent and control waterborne illness 
and outbreaks. Effective water management programs in 
buildings at increased risk for Legionella growth and transmission 
can reduce the risk for disease from drinking water pathogens.
