Background-—Breastfeeding confers substantial benefits to child health and has also been associated with lower risk of maternal
cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) in later life. However, the evidence on the effects of CVD is still inconsistent, especially in East
Asians, in whom the frequency and duration of breastfeeding significantly differ from those in the West.
Methods and Results-—In 2004–2008, the nationwide China Kadoorie Biobank recruited 0.5 million individuals aged 30 to 79
years from 10 diverse regions across China. During 8 years of follow-up, 16 671 incident cases of coronary heart disease and
23 983 cases of stroke were recorded among 289 573 women without prior CVD at baseline. Cox regression yielded adjusted
hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for incident CVD by breastfeeding. Overall, �99% of women had given birth, among whom 97%
reported a history of breastfeeding, with a median duration of 12 months per child. Compared with parous women who had
never breastfed, ever breastfeeding was associated with a significantly lower risk of CVD, with adjusted HRs of 0.91 (95% CI,
0.84–0.99) for coronary heart disease and 0.92 (95% CI, 0.85–0.99) for stroke. Women who had breastfed for ≥24 months had
an 18% (HR, 0.82; 0.77–0.87) lower risk of coronary heart disease and a 17% (HR, 0.83; 0.79–0.87) lower risk of stroke
compared with women who had never breastfed. Among women who ever breastfed, each additional 6 months of breastfeeding
per child was associated with an adjusted HR of 0.96 (95% CI, 0.94–0.98) for coronary heart disease and 0.97 (95% CI, 0.96–
0.98) for stroke.
Conclusions-—Among Chinese women, a history of breastfeeding was associated with an �10% lower risk of CVD in later life and
the magnitude of the inverse association was stronger among those with a longer duration of breastfeeding. (J Am Heart Assoc.

 in later life,9 which may lead to long-term protective benefits
for cardiometabolic diseases.
A few previous studies of mostly Western populations have
assessed the association between breastfeeding duration and
maternal risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs),10–14 but with
inconclusive findings about the direction, magnitude, and
shape of any putative relationship. Some of these discrepan-
cies may be explained by methodological differences between
studies, such as variation in study design, small sample sizes,
different exposure definitions, or varying levels of covariate
adjustment. Moreover, some studies were restricted to fatal
CVD end points,10,11,14 whereas others only examined
specific types of CVD,12,13 typically coronary heart disease
(CHD), without evaluating other major types of incident CVD,
such as ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke.
Major differences in breastfeeding practices, between and
within populations, may also explain some of the discordance
in study findings.15 Breastfeeding initiation rates are typically
considerably higher and breastfeeding duration is typically
longer in women from low- and middle-income countries,
compared with those in high-income countries. In China,
breastfeeding is almost universal and many women continue
to breastfeed their infants for long durations, particularly in
older generations. While breastfeeding practices in China
have changed considerably over recent decades, with declines
in both the likelihood and duration of breastfeeding, they
remain significantly different from those in the West.16 There
is limited evidence about the long-term relevance of breast-
feeding on the risk of CVD in a contemporary Chinese
population, overall or in different population subgroups. We
examined the relationship between breastfeeding and the risk
of several major CVDs among 300 000 women from the
prospective China Kadoorie Biobank study.17
Methods
Study Population
Detailed information about the study design and procedures of
China Kadoorie Biobank has been previously reported.17 Briefly,
between 2004 and 2008, 302 669 women and 210 222 men
aged 35 to 79 years were recruited from 5 urban and 5 rural
areas of China. At the baseline study assessment clinics,
trained health workers administered a laptop-based question-
naire that covered demographic and socioeconomic status,
lifestyle factors, and medical history. Detailed information on
women’s reproductive factors was also collected, including age
at menarche; the number of pregnancies, abortions, and live
births; and the total duration of any breastfeeding for each live
birth. From this, the mean duration of breastfeeding per child
and cumulative lifetime duration of any breastfeeding for all
children were calculated for parous women. A series of physical
measurements were taken using standard methods and a blood
sample was collected for long-term storage. Central ethical
approvals were obtained from Oxford University and the China
National Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
Approvals were also obtained from institutional research
boards at the local CDCs in the 10 areas. All study participants
provided written informed consent.
Follow-Up for Morbidity and Mortality
Study participants were followed for cause-specific morbidity
and mortality through linkage with regional disease and death
registers and with the national health insurance system. Causes
of death were derived from official death certificates and were,
where necessary, supplemented by reviews of medical records.
Data linkage with health insurance agencies was performed
every 6 months in each region to retrieve all hospitalized events
occurring in that period for study participants. Active follow-up
was performed annually to minimize attrition. The end points for
this study were incident CVD (I00–I99); CHD (I20–I25);
cerebrovascular disease (henceforth, “stroke”) (I60–I69),
including hemorrhagic stroke (I61) and ischemic stroke (I63);
major CVDs (ie, I21–I23, I60–I61, I63–I64 [any] and I00–I20,
I24–I25, I27–I59, I62, I65–I88, I95–I99 [only where fatal]); and
fatal CVDs (I00–I99). Women with a self-reported history of
CHD or stroke at baseline were excluded (n=13 096), leaving
289 573 women for further analyses.
Statistical Analyses
Baseline characteristics are presented as means (SDs) for
continuous variables and as percentages for categorical
variables. Cox proportional hazards models were used to
estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for the study end
points associated with breastfeeding history, comparing
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• While breastfeeding confers substantial benefits to child
health, its effects on maternal cardiovascular health remain
uncertain.
• This large prospective cohort study among nearly 300 000
women in China showed that, among parous women, a
history of breastfeeding was associated with an �10% lower
risk of several major cardiovascular diseases in later life.
• Among women who had ever breastfed, each additional
6 months of breastfeeding was associated with a further
�3% to 4% lower cardiovascular disease risk.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• If causal, these findings suggest that interventions to
increase the likelihood and duration of breastfeeding could
have persistent benefits to maternal cardiovascular health.

 parous women who had never breastfed with nulliparous
women and with parous women who ever breastfed. The Cox
proportional hazards assumption was checked using log
cumulative hazard plots and appeared to be reasonable. For
comparisons
involving
more
than
2
groups,
CIs
were
estimated using floating absolute risks, enabling valid com-
parisons between any 2 groups, even if neither is the baseline
group.18 In analyses restricted to parous women, we obtained
the HRs and CIs associated with mean duration of breast-
feeding per child, comparing those who had never breastfed
with those who breastfed each child for >0 to 6, 6 to 12, 12 to
18, 18 to 24, or >24 months. Among women who had ever
breastfed, we estimated the HRs for each additional 6 months
of breastfeeding per child. Analyses were stratified by age at
risk (5-year age groups) and area of residence (10 areas) and
adjusted for highest level of education attained (none,
primary, secondary, and tertiary or above), household income
(<5000, 5000–19 999, and ≥20 000 yuan), smoking (cur-
rent, former, and never), alcohol use (weekly, occasionally,
and never), physical activity, systolic blood pressure, history
of hypertension, history of diabetes mellitus, and body mass
index.
Several sensitivity analyses were conducted. First, in
analyses among women who had ever breastfed, we addi-
tionally adjusted for other reproductive factors, ie, age at
menarche, age at first birth, and total number of miscarriages,
induced abortions, and stillbirths. Second, among parous
women, we obtained the HRs and CIs associated with
cumulative lifetime duration of breastfeeding, with additional
adjustment for the number of live births. Third, we restricted
the analyses on breastfeeding duration to women who had
given birth to only 1 child. Subgroup analyses were conducted
to obtain the HRs associated with mean duration of breast-
feeding per child, separately by study region and by birth
cohort. Further subgroup analyses by study region, birth
cohort, highest level of attained education, body mass index,
smoking status, and history of hypertension were conducted
to obtain the HRs comparing parous women who had ever
breastfed with parous women who had never breastfed.
Among those who had ever breastfed, we conducted similar
subgroup analyses to obtain the HRs associated with each
additional 6 months of breastfeeding per child. Analyses were
performed using SAS version 9.3 and R version 3.1.2.
Results
Of the 289 573 women included, the mean baseline age was
51 years and 99% reported having at least 1 live birth, among
whom, 97% had ever breastfed and 91% had breastfed each
child for at least 6 months. The median duration of breast-
feeding per child was 12 months. Women who had breastfed
for longer durations were older and were more likely to come
from rural areas compared with women who had never
breastfed or had breastfed for shorter durations (Table 1).
During a median of 8.1 years (quartile 1: 7.2; quartile 3:
9.1) of follow-up, 49 377 incident cases of CVD were
recorded, including 16 671 cases of CHD and 23 983 of
stroke (14 290 ischemic and 2998 hemorrhagic stroke).
History of Breastfeeding and CVD Risk
There were no significant differences in the risk of CVD
between nulliparous women and parous women who had
never breastfed (Table 2). In contrast, parous women who had
ever breastfed were at a significantly lower risk of major CVD
and its main components (ie, CHD and stroke) than parous
women who had never breastfed; the adjusted HRs were 0.88
(95% CI, 0.80–0.97) for major CVD, 0.91 (95% CI, 0.84–0.99)
for CHD, 0.92 (95% CI, 0.85–0.99) for stroke, and 0.88 (95%
CI, 0.79–0.97) for ischemic stroke. The HRs did not vary
materially by study areas, birth cohorts, or other population
subgroups (Figure 1).
Breastfeeding Duration and CVD Risk
Among women who ever breastfed, there was an inverse log-
linear association between the duration of breastfeeding per
child and the risk of several major CVDs, except hemorrhagic
stroke (Figure 2 and Tables S1 and S2). Compared with
women who had never breastfed, women who had breastfed
between 0 to 6 months, 6 to 12 months, 12 to 18 months,
18 to 24 months, or over 24 months had a 1%, 7%, 11%, 13%,
and 18% lower risk of CHD, respectively, with each additional
6 months of breastfeeding per child associated with 4% (2–
5%) lower CHD risk (P for trend <0.001). For stroke, the
association was similar, with each additional 6 months of
breastfeeding per child associated with an adjusted HR of
0.97 (95% CI, 0.96–0.98) for stroke (Table 1), with limited
evidence of substantial differences across population sub-
groups (Figure 3). Additional adjustment for women’s repro-
ductive health factors had little impact on the results
(Table S1). Moreover, analyses by total lifetime duration of
breastfeeding, or restricted to women with only 1 child,
yielded similar associations (Tables S3 and S4). The results
were broadly similar between women in urban and rural areas
and did not vary by different birth cohort (Figures S1 and S2).
Discussion
This large prospective cohort study among nearly 300 000
women in China provides the most comprehensive assess-
ment yet of the effects of breastfeeding on the risk of major

 CVDs in later life. Parous women who had ever breastfed were
at an �10% lower risk of major CVD subtypes compared with
parous women who had never breastfed. Moreover, among
those who had ever breastfed, each additional 6 months of
breastfeeding was associated with a further �3% to 4% lower
CVD risk. These results persisted after adjustment for a range
of potential confounders and were broadly consistent across
major population subgroups.
Previous studies of mostly Western populations have
reported conflicting results on the relationship between
breastfeeding and the risk of CVD.10–14 In the US Nurses’
Health Study of 90 000 parous women with 2500 cases of
CHD, there was a threshold in the association between
breastfeeding and CHD; only women with a lifetime duration
of breastfeeding of ≥2 years had a significantly lower risk of
CHD than those who never breastfed.13 The HUNT trial (Nord-
Trøndelag Health Study)14 of 20 000 Norwegian women
reported that the inverse association between a history of
breastfeeding and CVD mortality was modified by age. Among
women younger than 65 years, there was some evidence of a
U-shaped relationship between lifetime duration of breast-
feeding and the risk of CVD death, with women who reported
lifetime breastfeeding duration of 7 to 12 months having half
the risk than those who had breastfed for ≥2 years. In
contrast, the EPIC (European Prospective Investigation into
Cancer and Nutrition)-CVD case-cohort study, among 15 000
women with 5000 incident cases of CHD, found an inverse
association between breastfeeding and the risk of CHD at all
ages.12 The risk of CHD was the lowest among those who had
breastfed for the longest durations, suggesting that prolonged
durations of breastfeeding confer additional coronary bene-
fits. An additional study among 200 000 parous women in the
EPIC trial reported that a history of breastfeeding was
associated with a 20% and 31% lower risk of mortality from
CVD and CHD, respectively, but did not find any significant
effect of breastfeeding on stroke.11 In China, only 1 prospec-
tive study has previously examined the association between
breastfeeding and CVD risk. In that study among 250 000
textile workers in Shanghai, born between 1925 and 1958,10
there were no consistent associations between breastfeeding
duration and the risk of fatal CHD, ischemic stroke, or
hemorrhagic stroke, which may be attributable to the
relatively small number of deaths included (420 CHD, 575
ischemic stroke, and 1583 hemorrhagic stroke). In contrast,
the present analysis included a substantially larger number of
fatal and nonfatal CVD cases and provides the largest and
most comprehensive analyses to date on the relationship
between breastfeeding initiation and duration and the risk of
several major CVDs among urban and rural Chinese women.
The observational nature of the present study does not
allow us to determine whether the inverse relationship
between breastfeeding and CVD risk is causal. However,

 several mechanisms have been postulated to underpin the
association between breastfeeding and CVD risk in later life.19
Pregnancy is characterized by major changes in the maternal
metabolic system to support fetal growth and in anticipation
of breastfeeding, including accumulation of visceral fat,
increased insulin resistance, and higher circulating lipid
levels.1,2 The “reset hypothesis” posits that breastfeeding
plays a central role in mobilizing these accumulated fat stores
and in resetting the maternal metabolism after birth.3 The
longer a woman breastfeeds, the more completely these
accumulated stores may be deposited, potentially with lasting
benefits for maternal cardiometabolic health. Prolonged
breastfeeding has been associated with improved b-cell
function,20

 profiles,4,21 and lower risks of incident hypertension and type
2 diabetes mellitus.8,9 In contrast, studies on the potential
benefits of breastfeeding on gestational weight retention and
body adiposity in later life have reported mixed results.22–24 In
a previous analysis of this study, we did not find a relationship
between breastfeeding duration and general or central
adiposity.22 Therefore, breastfeeding may also be a marker
of health-promoting behaviors, rather than a causal determi-
nant of improved cardiometabolic outcomes itself. Several
studies in Western populations have demonstrated that
women who breastfeed are generally wealthier and more
likely to engage in other beneficial health behaviors than
women who do not breastfeed.15,25,26 However, this pattern is
reversed in the present study, in which poorer women from
rural areas of China were more likely to breastfeed for a
longer duration than their wealthier urban counterparts.
Moreover, adjustment for various sociodemographic and
lifestyle factors had little impact on our findings.
The strengths of this study include its large sample size, the
prospective follow-up for the occurrence of several major CVDs,
and the availability of detailed information on a range of
reproductive, sociodemographic, and lifestyle-related factors.
The generalizability of the study findings was enhanced by the
inclusion of women from 10 diverse localities across China. The
applicability of our findings to other countries and ethnicities
needs to be addressed in further research. Our study did not
collect data on CVD risk factors either before or during
pregnancy that might determine breastfeeding as well as future
CVD risk. Therefore, we cannot preclude the possibility that the
findings were subject to unmeasured or residual confounding.

 Moreover, our results may be liable to reverse causality as
certain metabolic conditions, such as pregestational diabetes
mellitus or high maternal body mass index, may affect the ability
to initiate and sustain breastfeeding and may also confer a
higher risk of cardiometabolic conditions.27–29 Furthermore, as
in most previous studies, information on breastfeeding was self-
reported and solicited several years after childbirth and
breastfeeding. This could have led to measurement error,
which, if at random, would have underestimated the true
strengths of the observed associations. Information about the
duration of exclusive breastfeeding and the provision of
complementary infant food was also not available, which limits
interpretations of the effects seen.
Breastfeeding is one of the few beneficial health behaviors
that are more common in low- and middle-income countries
than in high-income countries, and within low- and middle-
income countries is more common among poorer than richer
women.15 This socioeconomic gradient in breastfeeding is
particularly relevant to China, a country where breastfeeding
durations have declined dramatically over the past several
decades and where breastfeeding practices continue to vary
greatly across different parts of the country.16 In 2008, fewer
than 16% of women in urban and �30% of women in rural areas
exclusively breastfed their babies throughout the World Health
Organization’s recommended period of 6 months.30 Common
reasons for prematurely ceasing exclusive breastfeeding are
the perceived insufficiency of breast milk, traditions regarding
the introduction of complementary food, and maternal or child
illness. Intensive industry promotion of breast milk substitutes,
limited duration of maternity leave, and inadequate facilities to
continue to breastfeed at the workplace also contribute to
shorter durations of breastfeeding, particularly in urban
China.31 Although there is increasing recognition of the
importance of exclusive breastfeeding, genuine commitment
from policy makers is needed to implement strategies in the
healthcare system, communities and families, and the work
environment that promote and support every woman to
breastfeed.32 If effective and sustained, such efforts are likely
to confer major benefits to the health of children and women,
along with substantial cost savings.15,32
Conclusions
This large prospective study showed that breastfeeding is
associated with an �10% lower risk of several major CVDs in
later life among Chinese women and the magnitude of the
inverse association was stronger among those with a longer
duration of breastfeeding. If causal, these findings suggest
that interventions to increase the likelihood and duration of
breastfeeding could have persistent benefits to maternal
cardiovascular health.

Figure S1: Adjusted* hazard ratios and 95% CIs for incident cardiovascular disease, coronary heart 
disease, and stroke associated with duration of breastfeeding per child among parous women 
who ever breastfed, by region..*Analyses are stratified by age at risk and study area, and adjusted 
for level of attained education, household income, smoking status, alcohol use, systolic blood 
pressure, history of hypertension, physical activity, body mass index, and history of diabetes. The 
hazard ratios (HRs) are plotted on a floating absolute scale. Each square has an area inversely 
proportional to the standard error of the log risk. Vertical lines indicate the corresponding 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs).
