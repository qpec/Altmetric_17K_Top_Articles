Association Between Long-Lasting Intravitreous Fluocinolone
Acetonide Implant vs Systemic Anti-inflammatory Therapy
and Visual Acuity at 7 Years Among Patients With
Intermediate, Posterior, or Panuveitis
Writing Committee for the Multicenter Uveitis Steroid Treatment (MUST) Trial and Follow-up Study Research Group
IMPORTANCE A randomized clinical trial comparing fluocinolone acetonide implant vs
systemic corticosteroids and immunosuppression for treatment of severe noninfectious
intermediate, posterior, and panuveitides did not result in a significant difference in visual
acuity at 2 and 4.5 years; longer-term outcomes are not known.
OBJECTIVE To compare the association between intravitreous fluocinolone acetonide implant
vs systemic therapy and long-term visual and other outcomes in patients with uveitis.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Nonprespecified 7-year observational follow-up of the
Multicenter Uveitis Steroid Treatment (MUST) randomized clinical trial comparing the
alternative treatments. Follow-up was conducted in tertiary uveitis subspecialty practices in
the United States (21), the United Kingdom (1), and Australia (1). Of 255 patients 13 years or
older with intermediate, posterior, or panuveitis (active within �60 days) enrolled in the
MUST trial between December 6, 2005, and December 9, 2008, 215 consented to ongoing
follow-up through at least 7 years postrandomization (last visit, February 10, 2016).
INTERVENTIONS Participants had been randomized to receive a surgically placed
intravitreous fluocinolone acetonide implant or systemic corticosteroids supplemented by
immunosuppression. When both eyes required treatment, both eyes were treated.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary outcome was change from baseline in
best-corrected visual acuity in uveitic eyes (5 letters = 1 visual acuity chart line; potential
range of change in letters read, −121 to +101; minimal clinically important difference, 7 letters),
analyzed by treatment assignment accounting for nonindependence of eyes when patients
had 2 uveitic eyes. Secondary outcomes included potential systemic toxicities of
corticosteroid and immunosuppressive therapy and death.
RESULTS Seven-year data were obtained for 161 uveitic eyes (70% of 90 patients assigned to
implant) and 167 uveitic eyes (71% of 90 patients assigned to systemic therapy) (77% female;
median age at enrollment, 48 [interquartile range, 36-56] years). Change in mean visual
acuity from baseline (implant, 61.7; systemic therapy, 65.0) through 7 years (implant, 55.8;
systemic therapy, 66.2) favored systemic therapy by 7.2 (95% CI, 2.1-12) letters. Among
protocol-specified, prospectively collected systemic adverse outcomes, the cumulative
7-year incidence in the implant and systemic therapy groups, respectively, was less than 10%,
with the exceptions of hyperlipidemia (6.1% vs 11.2%), hypertension (9.8% vs 18.4%),
osteopenia (41.5% vs 43.1%), fractures (11.3% vs 18.6%), hospitalization (47.6% vs 42.3%),
and antibiotic-treated infection (57.4% vs 72.3%).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In 7-year extended follow-up of a randomized trial of patients
with severe intermediate, posterior, or panuveitis, those randomized to receive systemic
therapy had better visual acuity than those randomized to receive intravitreous fluocinolone
acetonide implants. Study interpretation is limited by loss to follow-up.

N
oninfectious intraocular inflammation (uveitis) is an
important cause of visual impairment.1 Intermedi-
ate, posterior, and panuveitides, which involve the
middleandposteriorportionsoftheeye,2,3havebeentheforms
of uveitis most likely to cause vision loss.4-6
Systemic corticosteroids and corticosteroid-sparing im-
munosuppressive drugs have been used to manage a wide
range of inflammatory diseases, including uveitides. This ap-
proach has been the mainstay of treatment for severe nonin-
fectious intermediate, posterior, and panuveitides.3 Even
though systemic adverse effects have been thought to be mini-
mizedbyappropriatetreatmentimplementation,7concernsre-
garding potential systemic adverse effects thereof have lim-
ited the utilization of such therapy.8
In 2005, a local therapy alternative for intermediate,
posterior, and panuveitides was approved by the US Food and
Drug Administration: a long-lasting, surgically placed intra-
vitreous fluocinolone acetonide implant9-11 with minimal sys-
temic absorption, intended to avoid systemic adverse effects
completely. The MUST Trial Research Group directly com-
pared these contrasting long-term strategies in a 2-year ran-
domized clinical trial,12 succeeded by nonprespecified longi-
tudinal follow-up of the trial cohort. Through the primary
2-year time point13 and a subsequent observational cohort
analysis through 4.5 years after randomization,14,15 the 2 strat-
egies demonstrated visual acuity and systemic outcomes
that were not significantly different; significantly better
control of inflammation, with significantly more local ad-
verse outcomes, was observed with implant therapy. Given
considerations that the latter results eventually might alter vi-
sualoutcome,extendedfollow-upofthecohortthrough7years
after randomization was conducted.
Methods
Study Design
The Multicenter Uveitis Steroid Treatment (MUST) trial—a
2-year randomized (allocation ratio, 1:1), 23-center, parallel-
treatment clinical trial—was succeeded by nonprespecified ex-
tended follow-up of the cohort (The MUST Trial Follow-up
Study). The protocol for the original study is available in
Supplement 2; the protocol for the follow-up study is avail-
able in Supplement 3. Previous reports detail the study de-
signs;thetrialhypothesizedsuperiorityofimplanttherapy.12-15
All participants provided written informed consent for
study participation; all governing institutional review boards
providedongoingapprovals.Participantswhohadenrolledinto
the trial over 3 years (between December 6, 2005, and Decem-
ber 9, 2008) were followed up under that protocol until 2 years
after the last patient enrolled. Thereafter, when primary re-
sults were reported showing visual outcomes without statis-
tically significant differences,13 participants agreeing to con-
tinue in the follow-up study were encouraged to continue their
assigned treatment unless contraindicated and were fol-
lowed up until 7 years after their randomization (2 to 5 addi-
tional years, depending on how long they had been followed
up under the trial protocol; last 7-year visit, February 10, 2016).
Enrollment of Participants, Data Collection, and Follow-up
Patients were eligible for the trial if they were 13 years or older
and had noninfectious intermediate, posterior, or panuveitis
in 1 or both eyes (active within ≤60 days) for which systemic
corticosteroids were indicated. Patients requiring systemic
therapy for nonocular indications were excluded. Patients en-
rolled in the trial and subsequently the follow-up study were
treated at uveitis subspecialty centers in the United States (21),
United Kingdom (1), and Australia (1). Study visits were con-
ducted at least semiannually through 7 years (quarterly under
the trial protocol, every 6 months thereafter). Race and ethnic-
ity were evaluated based on self-report among US Census–
defined categories, given that the incidence of some uveitic
outcomes varies with race/ethnicity.16,17
Random Treatment Assignment
Trial participants had been randomized 1:1 to systemic or
implant therapy (both eyes treated when both eyes met eli-
gibility criteria) by variable-length (2-4 per block), permuted
blocks within strata (clinical center; and intermediate vs
posterior or panuveitis, given better reported outcomes for
intermediate vs posterior or panuveitis).18 After eligibility
and stratum were confirmed, the study website revealed the
participant’
s treatment assignment (produced in advance by
the Coordinating Center).19,20
Treatment Protocol
Clinicians and participants were instructed to apply the as-
signed treatment strategy throughout the trial; during the fol-
low-upstudy,theywereencouragedtocontinuethesametreat-
ment regimen unless contraindicated. The implant therapy
protocol required suppression of anterior chamber inflamma-
tion with topical, periocular, and/or systemic corticosteroids,
then placement of an intravitreous fluocinolone acetonide im-
plant (0.59 mg) (Bausch & Lomb) by study-certified surgeons
using a recommended technique10,21 within 28 and 56 days af-
ter randomization in the first and second (if indicated) eyes,
respectively.Thereafter,theprotocolrequiredtaperingandces-
sation of systemic corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, or
both, with reimplantation on occurrence of reactivated in-
flammation sufficiently severe to otherwise require systemic
Key Points
Question Is there a significant difference in visual acuity with
long-term follow-up of treatment with intravitreous fluocinolone
acetonide implant or systemic anti-inflammatory therapy for
severe intermediate, posterior, or panuveitis?
Findings In a nonprespecified 7-year observational follow-up of
215 participants in a randomized clinical trial, systemic therapy was
associated with significantly better visual acuity compared with
implant, by a mean of 7 letters; in contrast, the trial had shown
no significant difference at 2 years.
Meaning After 7 years, systemic corticosteroid and
immunosuppressive therapy was associated with better visual
acuity compared with fluocinolone acetonide implant. However,
these findings are limited by a 30% loss to follow-up, with possible
selection bias.

therapy. Best medical judgment was permitted for initial fail-
ure of implantation to control inflammation, implantation-
limiting toxicity, or incident systemic disease requiring sys-
temic therapy.
The systemic therapy protocol followed expert panel
guidelines,7 under which initially active uveitis was treated
using the lesser of 1 mg/kg/d or 60 mg/d of prednisone, fol-
lowed by prednisone tapering after control of inflammation
to a dose of 10 mg/d or less that was sufficient to maintain
control. The initial prednisone dose was tapered for patients
whose uveitis already was clinically graded as inactive at
baseline (≈20%). The protocol required immunosuppres-
sion for corticosteroid sparing when uveitis consistently
reactivated at prednisone doses above 10 mg/d, if intoler-
able corticosteroid-induced adverse effects were occurring,
for specific high-risk uveitic diseases, and if corticosteroids
failed to control inflammation. When immunosuppression
was required, clinicians selected among standard immuno-
suppressive drugs the ones most suitable for each patient
(see protocol in Supplement 2); administration and monitor-
ing for toxicity followed established guidelines.7
In the follow-up study, these treatments were continued
unless contraindicated per best medical judgment.
Outcomes and Masking
All outcomes were measured in the same way during the trial
and follow-up study, except that measurement of visual acuity
was performed by an unmasked certified examiner instead of
a masked examiner during the follow-up study, and hypergly-
cemia was assessed using fasting glucose levels through
January 2, 2011, and hemoglobin A1c values thereafter. Visual
acuity (during the trial period), glaucoma, and ocular imaging
Reading Center–ascertained outcomes were masked. Patients,
clinicians, and coordinators were not masked.12
Primary Outcome
Change in best-corrected visual acuity from baseline was the
primary outcome, measured by study-certified examiners
using a gold-standard protocol22 enforced by regular site vis-
its. Five letters equals 1 line on a logarithmic visual acuity
chart. The minimal clinically important difference (MCID)
for change in letters read is 7 letters, based on clinical trial
results of pivotal trials of treatments that later were widely
adopted for wet macular degeneration.23-26 The range of
possible values of change in letters read is −121 (+96 letters,
to no light perception scored as −25 letters) to +101 (from
hand motions, the lowest level of visual acuity allowed to
enroll to +96 letters). The observed range of change was
from −102 to +92 letters). Occurrence of legal blindness (20/200
orworse)—analternative,prespecifiedwayofsummarizingthe
gold standard visual acuity data—also was studied.
Secondary Outcomes Prespecified in the Trial Protocol
Overall visual field sensitivity within 24° of fixation was
measured using the mean deviation statistic,27 an overall mea-
sure summarizing the average difference between normative
results and a given eye’
s visual field sensitivity across points
in the central 24° of the visual field, weighted by normal
variability, with negative values representing loss of vision.28
We studied the incidence of a loss of 10 dB from baseline
(−6 to −12 dB is comparable to the visual impact of moderate
glaucoma29). Overall control of intraocular inflammation
(uveitis) was assessed based on clinically graded uveitis activ-
ity or inactivity. The presence or absence of macular edema
was determined by optical coherence tomography images
graded by the Reading Center.30 Regarding local ocular ad-
verse outcomes, intraocular pressure was measured as the me-
dianof3measurements(range,0-80+mmHg;observedrange,
0-60.5 mm Hg). Cataract and vitreous hemorrhage were di-
agnosed clinically. Use of medication or surgery for increased
intraocular pressure, or of surgery for cataract, was based on
the observation of such use.
Regarding systemic adverse events, potential systemic
toxicities of corticosteroid therapy, immunosuppressive
therapy, or both included incident diabetes mellitus
(diabetes-level hyperglycemia [fasting blood glucose level
≥140 g/dL {7.77 mmol/L} or, after January 2, 2011, hemoglo-
bin A1c level ≥6.5%], explicit diagnosis, and/or had started
hypoglycemic therapy); osteopenia (L2-L4 and femoral
next-worst T-score between −1.00 and −2.49) and osteoporo-
sis (T-score ≤−2.50); hyperlipidemia (had started anti-
hyperlipemic treatment); hypertension (had started antihy-
pertensive treatment); weight changes (from baseline
in kg); systemic infection for which anti-infectious therapy
was prescribed; hospitalization (and reasons for hospital-
ization); bone marrow suppression [white blood cell count
≤2500 cells/μL; platelet count ≤100 000/μL; hemoglobin
level ≤10 g/μL]; hepatotoxicity (aspartate aminotransferase
level, alanine aminotransferase level, or both ≥2-fold
above upper limit of normal); nephrotoxicity (drug discon-
tinuation for renal toxicity or observed serum creatinine level
≥1.5 mg/dL [132.6 μmol/L]); incident cancer (excluding non-
melanoma skin cancer); and death. At in-person study visits,
participants were asked about interim fractures, diagnosis of
cancer, treatment for hyperlipidemia or hypertension, hospi-
talization,anduseofantibioticsprescribedforaninfection.The
study team confirmed reported events using medical records.
A periodic audit, supplemented by a Social Security Death
Master File12 search, was conducted to ascertain mortality.
Self-reported quality-of-life (QOL) outcomes were as-
sessed during follow-up visits semiannually. Health utility and
vision- and general health–related quality of life were mea-
sured respectively using the EuroQol EQ-5D (range, less than
0.00 to 1.00, where 0.00 corresponds to immediate death and
1.00 to perfect health; MCID, 0.06-0.07 points), NEI-VFQ
(National Eye Institute Visual Functioning Questionnaire)
(range, 0-100; 0 corresponds to complete loss of visual
function accompanied by eye pain, dependence as a result
of vision loss, and anxiety about blindness; 100 reflects per-
fect visual function with lack of pain, anxiety, and depen-
dence; MCID, 4-6 points), and SF-36 (36-Item Short Form
Health Survey) physical health component (range, 0-100;
MCID, 3-5 points) and mental health component (range, 0-100;
MCID, 3-5 points) instruments (for both, 50 corresponds to
population average scores and 0 and 100 correspond to 5 SDs
above or below average).31-33

Cost-effectiveness analysis was prespecified in the study
protocolsbutwasnotconducted,givenconsiderationsofdomi-
nance when outcomes are as good or better for the less expen-
sive treatment.34
Nonprespecified Outcomes
Nonprespecified outcomes were limited to exploration of the
causes of visual loss by masked, retrospective review of study
forms through 7 years after randomization.
Statistical Analyses
Statistical analyses are detailed in the Statistical Analysis Plan
available in Supplement 4. In brief, the primary analyses were
based on treatment assignment; as-treated sensitivity analy-
ses also were conducted regarding the incidence of ocular ad-
verse outcomes. For the intention-to-treat primary outcome
comparison with the available sample size at the beginning of
the follow-up study—accounting for anticipated losses to
follow-up, crossovers, and correlation between uveitic eyes
of the same patient—the power to detect the prespecified dif-
ference of 7 standard letters in best-corrected visual acuity be-
tween randomized groups exceeded 80% at 7 years, with a
2-sided type I error probability of .05. Generalized estimating
equations with saturated-means models were used to evalu-
ate longitudinal outcomes.35 The unit of analysis was the
(uveitic) eye (including both eyes of a patient if applicable) or
the patient for eye-specific (eg, visual acuity) and patient-
specific (eg, QOL) outcomes, respectively. Bootstrapping ad-
dressed correlations between eyes of the same patient.
Incident adverse systemic and ocular outcomes were com-
paredusingfrailtymodels.Comparisonsbetweenpatientswith
and without a 7-year visit were made using χ2 tests and
Wilcoxon rank-sum tests for person-level characteristics and
mixed effects for eye-level characteristics. Because assess-
ments in this extension of the primary trial protocol were ex-
ploratory, reported 2-sided P values were not adjusted for mul-
tiple comparisons; ie, all tests were considered statistically
significant at the .05 level.
Robust standard errors were computed for all models.
Binary outcomes are summarized both in terms of absolute
(percent) and relative (odds ratio) differences. Worst-outcome
scenarios and mixed-effects models, which are robust to
data missing at random, were used to address loss to follow-up
and missing data.36 The Statistical Analysis Committee
(eAppendix in Supplement 1) conducted the analyses using
SAS version 9.1,37 Stata release 9.0,20 and R version 3.3.1.38
Results
Among the 255 patients enrolled in the trial (479 uveitic eyes;
see Figure 1) the majority were female (71% in implant group;
79% in systemic therapy group) and white (56% in each group).
The median ages were 46 years (interquartile range, 34-56) and
48 years (interquartile range, 35-57), respectively. Randomiza-
tion assigned 129 and 126 patients (245 and 234 uveitic eyes)
to receive implant and systemic therapy, respectively. At base-
line,theonlystatisticallysignificantdifferencesbetweengroups

Seven-year data were obtained for 171 uveitic eyes (70%)
of 90 patients assigned to implant and 167 uveitic eyes (71%)
of 90 assigned to systemic therapy. Characteristics of pa-
tients completing vs not completing that visit are described in
Table 1; potentially important differences were observed be-
tween these groups (regarding the distribution of baseline vi-
sual acuity, sex, white race, Hispanic ethnicity, anatomical lo-
cationoftheuveitis,presenceorabsenceofassociatedsystemic
inflammatory disease, bone density, duration of uveitis in uve-
itic eyes, and lens status), even though the differences were
not statistically significant.
Utilization of treatment over 7 years after randomization is
summarized in eFigure 1 in Supplement 1. Approximately 95%
of patients in the implant and systemic therapy groups ini-
tially received their assigned therapies. Among uveitic eyes of
implant-assigned patients, 84% of eyes had received 1 or more
implants,24%hadreceived2ormoreimplants,and1.2%ofeyes
had 3 or more implants by 7 years (not every second uveitic eye
met indications for implantation, and not all eyes experienced
sufficient reactivation of uveitis to warrant reimplantation).
After the first year, an average of about 20% to 25% implant-
assigned patients were taking systemic corticosteroids, immu-
nosuppressive drugs, or both at any given time. Most im-
planted eyes remained free of active uveitis while not receiving
other treatments longer than the anticipated 3 years9; for most
uveiticeyes,relapsesofinflammationandconsequentneedfor
treatment began approximately 5 years after implantation.
In the systemic therapy group, in addition to corticoste-
roids, 88% of participants assigned to receive systemic
therapy received immunosuppressive therapy during follow-
up; at 7 years, 34% and 43%, respectively, were taking oral
corticosteroids (median dose, 6.25 mg) and 1 or more immu-
nosuppressant or biologic agents. The percentage of systemic
therapy–assigned uveitic eyes treated with implant therapy
increased over time, with 18% of uveitic eyes receiving
an implant by 7 years (5 eyes assigned to receive systemic
therapy received 2 implants).
Primary Outcome: Visual Acuity
At 6 months postrandomization, both groups experienced im-
proved visual acuity (+5.9 vs +2.0 letters in the implant and
systemic therapy groups, respectively), with an early statisti-
cally significant implant advantage in the implant group (+2.8
letters [95% CI on difference, +0.33 to +6.6 letters, favoring im-
plant). Thereafter, with further improvement in the systemic
therapy group, the groups’visual acuity outcomes did not sig-
nificantly differ through 5 years, including at the trial pri-
mary outcome time point of 2 years. However, after 5 years,
the average visual acuity in the implant group began declin-
ing, whereas the systemic therapy group maintained similar
visual acuity on average. By 6 and 7 years, respectively, the
change in visual acuity from baseline (implant, −2.6 and −6.0
letters; systemic therapy, +2.4 letters and +1.2 letters) fa-
vored systemic therapy by a mean of 5.0 letters (95% CI, 0.08
to 9.9) and 7.1 letters (95% CI, 2.1 to 12), respectively (Table 2
and Figure 2).

Sensitivity analysis regarding missing data found that
among those with missing data on the change from baseline
to 7 years, the difference between the change in the implant
and systemic therapy groups would need to be 0.4 and 28.6
letters (both favoring implant) to make the overall differ-
ences nonsignificant or to favor the implant, respectively. This
would represent a reversal of 7.5 and 35.7 letters, respec-
tively, from what was observed. Sensitivity analyses using ran-
dom-effects models to evaluate clinic effects and other pos-
sibilities all showed a statistically significant benefit for
systemic therapy.
The proportion of patients with legal blindness (20/200
or worse), a prespecified way of summarizing the primary out-
come data, at 7 years vs baseline was 8% more in the implant
group and 1% less in the systemic therapy group (difference,
9.1% [95% CI, 1.3% to 17.2%] favoring systemic therapy). A post
hoc assessment of clinic-reported causes of incident visual im-
pairment to 20/50 or worse found that chorioretinal lesion
causes (excluding potentially reversible epiretinal mem-
branes and macular edema) increased more in the implant
group at 6 years (43%, vs 15% in the systematic therapy group;
difference, 29% [95% CI, 11% to 46%]; P < .001) and 7 years

with uveitis in both eyes,
one eye required little or
no treatment. Hence, a total
of 38 eyes either belonged
to these 7 patients or were
mildly affected second eyes
for which implant therapy
was not indicated.

a Snellen 20/40 is the equivalent of 70 letters read; a 5-letter difference is 1 line
of visual acuity. The minimal clinically important difference for change in
letters read is 7 letters (see “Methods”). The range of possible values
of change in letters read is from −121 (+96 letters to no light perception scored
as −25 letters) to +101 (from hand motions, the lowest level of visual acuity
allowed to enroll to +96 letters). The observed range of change from baseline
was −102 to +92 letters.
bPositive numbers favor implant treatment; negative numbers favor
systemic treatment.

(52%vs31%;difference,21%[95%CI,2%to39%]; P = .02).The
distributions of other causes of reduced visual acuity (includ-
ing current uveitis activity, current macular edema, and glau-
coma) did not significantly differ between groups.
Prespecified Secondary Outcomes
Visual Field Sensitivity
The change in the proportion with a −10-dB loss in overall vi-
sual field sensitivity from baseline was not significantly dif-
ferent between groups throughout follow-up (15% vs 8%, re-
spectively;difference,7.0%[95%CI,−3.5%to17.2%])(Table3).
Uveitis Activity and Macular Edema
Throughout follow-up, most uveitic eyes in both groups had
controlled eye inflammation. Significantly fewer eyes as-
signed to receive implant therapy had active inflammation
through 4.5 years, but by 5 years, the proportion of inflamed
eyes in the implant group increased to a level not statistically
significantly different from that in the systemic therapy group
(Figure 3A), as reactivations of uveitis began to occur more fre-
quently. The increased proportion with uveitis activity in the
implant group occurred approximately simultaneously with
divergence of the visual acuity outcomes.
Fewer eyes had macular edema in the implant group than
in the systemic therapy group at 6 months (Figure 3B).13
The reverse pattern was observed at 6 years (reduction from
baseline, −15% vs −28% [95% CI on difference, +0.9% to +25%
favoring systemic therapy])—coincident with the increase in
uveitis activity. At other time points, macular edema out-
comes did not significantly differ between groups.
Ocular and Systemic Adverse Outcomes
Throughout follow-up, the implant group had clinically and
statistically significantly higher incidences of elevated intra-
ocular pressure; need for medical and surgical treatments for
elevated intraocular pressure; and glaucoma (Table 4). By 7
years, 45% of eyes assigned to receive implant therapy vs 12%
assigned to receive systemic therapy had undergone surgery
to lower intraocular pressure, and 90% of phakic eyes as-
signed to receive an implant in the implant group had under-
gone cataract surgery (mostly in the first 2 years) vs 50% in the
systemic therapy group. In as-treated analyses, both intra-
ocular pressure–related and cataract-related differences be-
tween groups were larger, because these outcomes occurred
more often in eyes in the systemic therapy group that had re-
ceived implant therapy (eTable 1 in Supplement 1 reports the
as-treated analysis). Transient vitreous hemorrhage oc-
curred more frequently in implanted eyes (nearly always
surgery-related) but resolved promptly without sequelae.
Among protocol-specified, prospectively collected sys-
temic adverse outcomes (Table 4; eTable 1 in Supplement 1),
the cumulative 7-year incidence in both groups was less than
10%, with the exceptions of hyperlipidemia (6.1% vs 11.2%),
hypertension (9.8% vs 18.4%), osteopenia (41.5% vs 43.1%),
fractures (11.3% vs 18.6%), hospitalization (47.6% vs 42.3%),
andantibiotic-treatedinfection(57.4%vs72.3%)intheimplant

Best-corrected visual acuity results in standard letters are given for the first 7
years of follow-up; Snellen equivalents are provided for key cutpoints on
the right hand side of the plot (20/20 = 85 letters; 20/40 = 70 letters;
20/100 = 50 letters; 20/200 = 35 letters). Count fingers (CF), hand motion (HM),
or light perception (LP) and no light perception (NLP) are assigned values of −10
and −25 letters, respectively, because these levels of visual acuity are much lower
than reading 1 letter on the chart; these values are included in the summary
estimates. The middle line of each box indicates the median; ends of each box
indicate the interquartile range (IQR). The whiskers cover the shorter of 1.5 times
the IQR or the interval to the maximal or minimal value. Circles below whiskers
indicate outlier values; numbers below circles indicate the number of eyes with
a visual acuity of count fingers, hand motion, or light perception and no light
perception. Change from baseline transiently favored implant at 6 months
(P = .03) and favored systemic therapy from year 6 onward (P < .045).

vs systemic therapy groups, respectively. Hospitalizations for
infection were infrequent in both the implant and the sys-
temic therapy groups (9 hospitalizations vs 6, respectively).
Change in weight did not significantly differ between the
groups (eFigure 2 in Supplement 1). Bone marrow suppres-
sion and indicators of liver or renal injury were infrequent in
both groups, sometimes with higher incidence in the implant
group.Overallcancer(excludingnonmelanoticskincancer)and
mortality incidences were low in both groups.
Quality of Life
Mean health utility– and health-related QOL remained simi-
lar to baseline through 7 years in both groups (eTable 2 in
Supplement 1), whereas vision-related QOL improved from
baseline through 7 years to a degree at the low end of a mini-
mally clinically important difference (+4.7 and +5.7 units in the
implant and systemic therapy groups, respectively). Regard-
ing change in QOL measures from baseline for the treatment
groups, most differences between groups were close to zero
by 7 years, whereas most scales had suggested a small advan-
tage for implant therapy on the order of the MCID at 2 years
(eTable 2 in Supplement 1). The only scale exhibiting a MCID
between groups at 7 years (mental health component of the
SF-36, +4.28-unit advantage for implant) was not consistent
in this advantage over time, having also shown a minimally
clinically important difference in favor of implant through 2
years, but not at years 3 through 6.
Discussion
In this 7-year extended follow-up of a randomized trial of pa-
tients with intermediate, posterior, or panuveitis, those ran-
domized to receive systemic therapy had better visual acuity
than those randomized to receive intravitreous fluocinolone
acetonide implants. The mean difference between groups at
7 years was on the order of the average treatment benefit ob-
served in clinical trials foundational to approval of treat-
ments for choroidal neovascularization in the era before
the introduction of vascular endothelial growth factor

the therapies by many ophthalmologists.

gan occurring in many implanted eyes, which a post hoc analy-
sis found to arise disproportionately from irreversible chorio-
retinal lesions in the implant group, possibly related to severe
inflammatory recurrences. Scheduled replacement of im-
plants prior to uveitis relapse may have had better results but
has not been used in clinical practice. While such replacement
may be useful in appropriate cases,39 it would be challenging
to implement across the board because of variation on the or-
der of 1 year in the duration of effect of the implant and the fre-
quent ocular adverse outcomes after first implantation, which
would constrain reimplantation in some cases.
Although eyes assigned to receive systemic therapy had
better visual acuity outcomes, both groups had favorable vi-
sual outcomes overall, with maintenance of baseline vision in

the systemic group and loss of a mean of 6 letters over 7 years
in the implant group. Many eyes, especially in the implant
group, required cataract surgery and other ophthalmic medi-
cal and surgical interventions, indicating that ongoing man-
agement was necessary to achieve and maintain these favor-
able results.
Although both approaches usually were successful in con-
trolling inflammation, implant therapy achieved inflamma-
tory control both faster and more often during the first 5 years
after implantation. Implant therapy sometimes was used to
rescue patients whose uveitis did not respond to systemic
therapy, as reported elsewhere10,40; implant therapy also con-
trolled uveitis about 50% longer than had been anticipated,
suggesting advantages of this approach when systemic ther-
apyfailsorisnotfeasible.After5years,uveitisreactivationsoc-
curred often enough to make the proportion controlled not
significantly different thereafter. Superiority in controlling
inflammation during the first 5 years did not result in better
longer-term visual outcomes; most patients in the systemic
therapy group whose uveitis was incompletely controlled had
improvedinflammation,14whereastheperiodofsevereinflam-
mation at the time of relapse in the implant group may have
caused more damage than lower-grade relapses with slow
tapering of treatment in the systemic group.
Ocular adverse outcomes of uveitis or its treatment were
more common in the implant group, whereas the incidence of
most systemic adverse outcomes was less different between
the 2 groups. Despite prospective follow-up in the context of
a clinical trial and subsequent prospective cohort study, a large
proportion of patients developed glaucoma—mostly with im-
plant therapy—confirming that frequent, diligent monitoring
for elevated intraocular pressure and early aggressive man-
agement (usually surgical) is especially essential after place-
ment of fluocinolone acetonide implants. Serious complica-
tions directly attributable to surgical implant placement
were infrequent.
Oral corticosteroid therapy combined with immunosup-
pressive drugs to achieve low prednisone maintenance
doses—or no prednisone at all—was well tolerated by most pa-
tients, even though continued low-dose corticosteroid treat-
ment was used for many years for a large proportion. The pro-
spectively studied broad range of potential complications of
systemic corticosteroids and of immunosuppressive drugs had
incidences that did not differ much between groups. The ex-
ception of a higher number in the systemic therapy group re-
ceiving antibiotics for infections did not result in poor long-
term outcomes and may have been affected by unmasked
clinicians’and patients’knowledge of treatment with corti-
costeroids and immunosuppression. With the available study
power, increased risk of rare events with one of the treat-
ments would not have been detected, but low increases in risk
on that order for the prespecified systemic outcomes would

diverged further over time. Further study regarding those is-
sues would be valuable. These exploratory observations sug-
gest that use of systemic anti-inflammatory therapy in this
manner, as is done for a wide variety of diseases, is unlikely
to induce large amounts of systemic adverse effect morbidity
at least over a period of up to 7 years.
Limitations
This study has several limitations. The follow-up after
completion of the 2-year clinical trial was not prespecified, so
the associations observed after 2 years should be viewed as
exploratory. Furthermore, losses to follow-up of 30% by 7
years—with some potentially important differences between
patients lost and those followed up—could have introduced a
selection bias if there was a sufficient interaction between
follow-up status and treatment assignment in relation to out-
come (which sensitivity analysis indicated is unlikely).
Incomplete masking (given a surgical treatment with oph-
thalmoscopically visible intraocular implant) raises the

Regarding uveitis activity, there were statistically significant differences from
6 months through 54 months, favoring implant therapy; differences were
not statistically significant thereafter. For macular edema, there were
statistically significant differences only at 6 months (favoring implant therapy)
and 72 months (favoring systemic therapy). See also Table 2.

of evolution of differences in visual acuity did not corre-
spond to the point at which unmasking of the visual acuity ex-
aminer occurred; neither was there a change in the method
of ascertainment of uveitis activity after 5 years. Also, fully
masked outcomes (eg, glaucoma) followed the same pattern
as corresponding unmasked outcomes (treatment for el-
evated intraocular pressure).

Crossover treatment in about 20% in each group affected
ascertainment of comparative efficacy; if systemic therapy has
inherently better outcomes in the long run, then crossovers to
implant per clinician and patient judgment might have led to
underestimation of the benefit. However, most crossovers oc-
curred when patients assigned to systemic therapy could not
achieve adequate control with systemic therapy, when repeat
implant therapy was judged contraindicated owing to adverse
outcomes, or when incident systemic disease required sys-
temictherapy.Inaclinicaltrialcomparinginitialtreatmentstrat-

Conclusions
In 7-year extended follow-up of a randomized trial of pa-
tients with intermediate, posterior, or panuveitis, those ran-
domized to receive systemic therapy had better visual acuity
than those randomized to receive intravitreous fluocinolone
acetonide implants. Study interpretation is limited by loss
to follow-up.
