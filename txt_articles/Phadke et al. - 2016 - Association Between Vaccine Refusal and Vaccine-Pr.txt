Abstract
IMPORTANCE—Parents hesitant to vaccinate their children may delay routine immunizations or 
seek exemptions from state vaccine mandates. Recent outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases in 
the United States have drawn attention to this phenomenon. Improved understanding of the 
association between vaccine refusal and the epidemiology of these diseases is needed.
OBJECTIVE—To review the published literature to evaluate the association between vaccine 
delay, refusal, or exemption and the epidemiology of measles and pertussis, 2 vaccine-preventable 
diseases with recent US outbreaks.
EVIDENCE REVIEW—Search of PubMed through November 30, 2015, for reports of US 
measles outbreaks that have occurred since measles was declared eliminated in the United States 
(after January 1, 2000), endemic and epidemic pertussis since the lowest point in US pertussis

 incidence (after January 1, 1977), and for studies that assessed disease risk in the context of 
vaccine delay or exemption.
FINDINGS—We identified 18 published measles studies (9 annual summaries and 9 outbreak 
reports), which described 1416 measles cases (individual age range, 2 weeks-84 years; 178 cases 
younger than 12 months) and more than half (56.8%) had no history of measles vaccination. Of 
the 970 measles cases with detailed vaccination data, 574 cases were unvaccinated despite being 
vaccine eligible and 405 (70.6%) of these had nonmedical exemptions (eg, exemptions for 
religious or philosophical reasons, as opposed to medical contraindications; 41.8%of total). 
Among 32 reports of pertussis outbreaks, which included 10 609 individuals for whom vaccination 
status was reported (age range, 10 days-87 years), the 5 largest statewide epidemics had 
substantial proportions (range, 24%–45%) of unvaccinated or undervaccinated individuals. 
However, several pertussis outbreaks also occurred in highly vaccinated populations, indicating 
waning immunity. Nine reports (describing 12 outbreaks) provided detailed vaccination data on 
unimmunized cases; among 8 of these outbreaks from 59%through 93%of unvaccinated 
individuals were intentionally unvaccinated.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—A substantial proportion of the US measles cases in the 
era after elimination were intentionally unvaccinated. The phenomenon of vaccine refusal was 
associated with an increased risk for measles among people who refuse vaccines and among fully 
vaccinated individuals. Although pertussis resurgence has been attributed to waning immunity and 
other factors, vaccine refusal was still associated with an increased risk for pertussis in some 
populations.
Vaccine coverage, estimates of the number of people who have received vaccines, remains 
high among young children for most routine vaccines. For example, in 2013 national 
coverage was 91.9% for 1 dose or more of measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine, and 83.1% 
for 4 doses or more of diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine.1 Many 
childhood vaccine-preventable diseases have been effectively controlled.2 However, recent 
outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases in the United States have prompted clinicians, 
public health officials, politicians, the media, and the public to pay greater attention to the 
growing phenomenon of vaccine refusal and hesitancy.3–5
In individual studies, vaccine refusal has been associated with outbreaks of invasive 
Haemophilus influenzae type b disease,6 varicella,7 pneumococcal disease,8 measles,9 and 
pertussis.10 The most direct measure of vaccine refusal is the rate of parents claiming 
nonmedical exemptions to school immunization requirements. Nonmedical exemptions can 
include religious exemptions, if a parent feels that immunizations conflict with their 
religious or spiritual beliefs (eg, objection to the use of fetal tissue in the production of some 
vaccines), or personal belief exemptions, if a parent objects to immunizations for moral or 
philosophical reasons (eg, objection to the use of nonnatural products or the total number of 
vaccines to be administered). Sometimes it is difficult to distinguish between purely 
religious or philosophical objections to immunization and safety concerns about vaccines 
that manifest as nonmedical exemptions.3–5 Over the past 20 years, rates of nonmedical 
exemptions have steadily increased.10,11 Initially this increase in exemptions was seen only 
among states that more readily offered personal belief exemptions (ie, those with easier 
procedures for obtaining such exemptions).10 However, more recently, states with

 moderately difficult exemption procedures and religious exemptions have experienced 
increases in rates.12
An outbreak of measles in late 2014 that originated at Disneyland in Anaheim, California, 
highlighted vaccine refusal and related disease outbreaks.13 This outbreak was associated 
with 111 cases (accounting for two-thirds of the total measles cases reported by April 2, 
2015) in 7 US states, Canada, and Mexico.14,15 Approximately half the cases were among 
unvaccinated persons, most of whom were eligible for vaccination yet intentionally 
remained unvaccinated.14,16 Although previous studies demonstrated associations between 
rates of nonmedical exemption and the risk of acquiring vaccine-preventable diseases, they 
have been of varying design (eg, modeling studies) and quality, and did not systematically 
examine measles (or other vaccine-preventable diseases) and the contribution of refusals to 
disease outbreaks. This review evaluates the available evidence to characterize the 
relationship between vaccine refusal and the epidemiology of measles and pertussis, 2 
vaccine-preventable diseases with recent outbreaks in the United States.
Methods
Measles
We first searched for US-based measles outbreaks using PubMed (http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) for studies published through November 30, 2015, using 
the following search terms: measles vaccinated “United States,” measles unvaccinated 
“United States,” measles outbreak “United States,” measles import* “United States,” 
measles case* “United States,” and measles MMWR. We restricted our search to after the 
measles elimination era (reports published on or after January 1,200017) to provide the most 
relevant review of recent measles epidemiology. To evaluate the risk of measles associated 
with exemptions to vaccine mandates, we also searched using the terms: measles risk 
exemption. For this latter search we used no date restriction because we wanted to capture 
studies that directly assessed risk related to vaccine exemption, regardless of whether the 
outbreak occurred before or after elimination.
Pertussis
Unlike measles, pertussis remains endemic in the United States, and its incidence has been 
steadily rising since it reached a nadir in 1976.18 To account for this important difference 
between measles and pertussis, we adapted the search strategy for pertussis as follows: we 
first searched for US-based pertussis outbreaks, this time restricting our search to reports of 
nonoverlapping community or state pertussis outbreaks that have occurred since the lowest 
point in US pertussis incidence (those published after January 1, 1977). We again searched 
Pub Med for studies published through November 30, 2015, using the following search 
terms: pertussis epidemic, pertussis endemic, pertussis outbreak, and pertussis MMWR. To 
evaluate the risk of pertussis associated with vaccine exemption, we also searched using the 
terms: pertussis vaccine refusal, pertussis vaccine exemption, pertussis vaccine delay, 
pertussis vaccine hesitan*, pertussis undervaccination, and pertussis cluster. For this latter 
search we again used no date restrictions to capture studies that may have been published

 earlier than the start of the pertussis resurgence, because we expected any association 
between vaccine refusal and disease risk to be similar.
Results
Measles
Recent Epidemiology of Measles in the United States—Measles-containing 
vaccines were first licensed in the United States in 1963. Following their widespread 
introduction and 2 intensive elimination efforts over the following 2 decades, the incidence 
of measles fell dramatically, from more than 300 cases per 100 000 population in the 
prevaccine era to a median 1.3 cases per 100 000 from 1982 through 1988.19 From 1989 
through 1992 there was a resurgence of measles in multiple countries, including the United 
States, thought to be primarily due to suboptimal vaccine coverage among preschool-aged 
children, as well as a small number of vaccine failures after a single dose of measles-
containing vaccine. This motivated an intense public health effort to improve vaccine 
coverage in this age group.20 A third elimination effort, which started in the 1990s and 
included formal introduction of a second dose of measles-containing vaccine, further 
reduced the incidence of measles to less than 1 case per 1 million population by 1997–1999, 
culminating in successful elimination of endemic measles in the United States by 2000.17 
Since then, there have been a number of measles outbreaks in the United States, without 
reemergence of indigenous transmission. These importation-related outbreaks (eg, linked to 
individuals who acquired measles outside the United States and introduced it into their 
community upon return) totaled fewer than 250 measles cases annually until 2014, when the 
United States experienced 23 measles outbreaks and the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC) reported 668 measles cases, the highest number recorded since 
elimination (Box 1).15

Vaccine Refusal and Measles Outbreaks—Using the search strategy for measles 
outbreaks, a total of 687 articles were identified (eFigure 1A in the Supplement), of which 
65 were reports of measles outbreaks between 2000 and 2015. Of these 65 reports, we 
excluded 34 that were either duplicate reports (eg, a JAMA republication of an Morbidity 
and Mortality Weekly Report [MMWR] article) or that contained data that were updated or 
summarized in later reports. Of the remaining 31 reports, we selected 18 to generate a 
summary of measles outbreaks in the United States from 2000 through 2015 (Table 
1).14,21–37 Nine of these reports are surveillance summary reports from the CDC, 
summarizing multiple outbreaks during the reporting period.14,21–24,27,33,34,36 The 
remaining 9 reports are investigations related to a specific measles outbreak or 
importation.25,26,28–32,35,37 The 13 reports not used in the summary of measles outbreaks 
described individual outbreaks whose case data were captured and/or updated in the other 18 
summary reports.
Since January 1, 2000, there were 1416 reported measles cases (individual age range, 2 
weeks-84 years; 178 cases younger than 12 months) in the United States associated with

 outbreaks or periodic summary reports published through November 30, 2015.14,21–37 A 
total of 199 cases (14.1%) involved individuals with a history of receiving a measles-
containing vaccine, whereas 804 cases (56.8%) involved individuals with no history of 
receiving a measles-containing vaccine. Additionally, there were 231 cases (16.3%) that 
involved individuals with unknown history of measles-containing vaccine receipt and 174 
cases (16.3%) that involved individuals for whom the reported measles vaccination status 
did not distinguish between unknown or unvaccinated (eg, reported as “unknown or 
unvaccinated”). In 7 of these outbreak reports and annual summaries,14,29,33,34,36–38 there 
was sufficient information to determine the number of unvaccinated individuals with 
nonmedical exemptions. In these 7 reports, there were 970 cases, of which 574 cases 
occurred in unvaccinated individuals who were age-eligible for measles vaccination, and 405 
of the unvaccinated individuals (70.6%) were unvaccinated due to nonmedical exemptions 
(comprising 41.8% of the total cases reported).
There were 18 outbreaks that had sufficient data (ie, day of symptom onset and vaccination 
status for measles cases) to construct a cumulative epidemic curve (Figure 
1).23,26,29,31,35,37–49 These outbreaks consisted of 145 cases (median cases per outbreak, 6.5 
[range, 1–22]); of these cases, 111 individuals were unvaccinated, 11 individuals had 
unknown vaccination status, and 23 individuals had received at least 1 dose of vaccine. 
These 145 cases included index cases (ie, the first case to be identified in an outbreak) as 
well as additional cases that were identified in the course of each individual outbreak 
investigation. Each outbreak investigation classified individual cases within a specific 
“generation of spread” based on an established chain of transmission, or by inferring the 
sequence of transmission based on the date of symptom onset. For example, individuals that 
developed measles following exposure to the index case were considered to be in the first 
generation of outbreak spread, those who developed measles following exposure to those in 
the first generation were considered to be in the second generation of spread, and so on. The 
outbreaks evaluated in the cumulative epidemic curve included cases that occurred up to 5 
generations of spread after the index case, with the latest related case occurring 12 weeks 
after identification of the index case. When viewed by week of outbreak, unvaccinated 
individuals constituted a larger fraction of the total measles cases per week in the earliest 
weeks of an outbreak (eg, earlier generations).
Vaccine Refusal and Measles Risk—We identified 12 articles using the search for 
studies evaluating measles risk in the context of vaccine exemption (eFigure 1B in the 
Supplement). Of these, 10 were excluded: 1 was not published in English, 1 was an outbreak 
investigation, 5 were vaccine coverage analyses, 1 was a surveillance summary, and 2 were 
review articles related to the topic. Two studies directly examined the individual and 
community risks of measles associated with intentionally unvaccinated children (Table 
2).9,50 Both were retrospective cohort studies conducted using measles case data from the 
era before measles elimination (before 2000), and were therefore not included in our 
analysis of recent measles epidemiology. The first study used national measles surveillance 
data reported to the CDC from 1985 through 1992, inclusive of the 1989–1992 measles 
resurgence.9 In this study, unvaccinated children who had a vaccine exemption were 35 
times more likely to contract measles compared with vaccinated children. The epidemic

 curve of measles determined that the resurgence started a year earlier among children with 
exemptions compared with vaccinated children.9 The investigators also used mathematical 
modeling to determine that the prevalence of exemptions in a geographic region was also 
associated with disease risk in the nonexempt population in that region, with high local 
aggregation of individuals with exemptions (ie, clustering) being associated with greater 
measles incidence. A second study used Colorado measles cases from 1987 through 1998 
and found that children with exemptions were 22 times more likely to contract measles than 
vaccinated children.50 The absolute and relative risk of disease was highest among 
individuals with exemptions aged 3 to 10 years. This study also found that the frequency of 
exemptions at the county level was associated with county measles incidence, though there 
was no association between schools with higher rates of exemptions and school-based 
measles outbreaks. Exemptions were more likely to be in the index case and first generation 
(eg, individuals that acquired measles following exposure to the index case) (14.5%) 
compared with later generations (eg, those who acquired measles from individuals in the 
first generation or later rather than the index case) (7.1%). Among vaccinated children who 
contracted measles, 11% contracted it from an individual with an exemption (Box 2).50

Pertussis
Recent Epidemiology of Pertussis in the United States—Unlike measles, pertussis 
remains endemic in the United States. Following the widespread introduction of whole-cell 
pertussis vaccines into the routine childhood immunization schedule in the mid- 1940s, there 
was a marked reduction in pertussis incidence, from 150 000 to 260 000 cases annually to a 
nadir of 1010 cases in 1976.18 Since then, there has been a steady increase in the incidence 
of pertussis in the United States,51–53 with an interepidemic interval similar to the 
prevaccine era.54 For the past 10 years, more than 10 000 cases have been reported annually 
(>25 000 in the last 3 years), matching figures that have not been observed in more than 5 
decades (Box 1).18
This resurgence in pertussis has been attributed to multiple potential factors. Increased 
physician awareness and improvements in diagnostic techniques likely contributed to 
enhanced disease reporting early in the resurgence. Then, beginning in the mid-1990s, 
acellular pertussis vaccines replaced whole-cell vaccines in the childhood immunization 
schedule55—although these acellular vaccines cause fewer local (eg, pain, swelling, and 
redness) and systemic (eg, fever and irritability) reactions,56 they are less effective than 
whole-cell vaccines for preventing pertussis.57 More recently, waning immunity to pertussis 
has been increasingly recognized as an important factor in disease resurgence.58 Multiple 
observational studies, spanning epidemic and interepidemic periods, from a variety of 
geographic regions within the United States, found that a longer interval since receipt of the 
last pertussis-containing vaccine—including both the tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria 
toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) booster for adolescents or DTaP—was associated with 
an increased risk of pertussis.59–64 A recent meta-analysis, which included studies within

 and outside the United States, estimated that the odds of acquiring pertussis increased 1.33 
times for each additional year since the last dose of childhood DTaP.65
Vaccine Refusal and Pertussis Outbreaks—In the context of the now well-
established association between waning immunity to pertussis and increased disease risk, we 
sought to identify the contribution of vaccine exemptions to outbreak-related pertussis. 
Because multiple doses of pertussis-containing vaccine are needed to develop and maintain 
protective immunity to pertussis, pertussis vaccination status can be classified as completely 
unvaccinated (ie, having received no doses of pertussis-containing vaccine) or 
undervaccinated (ie, having received fewer than the recommended number of age-
appropriate doses of pertussis-containing vaccine). The Advisory Committee on 
Immunization Practices currently recommends 5 DTaP doses at age 2, 4, and 6 months, at 15 
to 18 months, and again at 4 to 6 years, as well as a Tdap booster in adolescence (between 
age 11 and 12 years), or adulthood (if the adolescent dose was missed), and during every 
pregnancy.66
We identified 1384 articles pertaining to pertussis outbreaks that have been described since 
the start of the pertussis resurgence (from January 1, 1977, through November 30, 2015). Of 
these, we screened 1123 unique titles and abstracts, and excluded 1028 from further review: 
these were studies conducted outside the United States, articles focusing on nonpertussis 
diseases, or papers deemed not relevant to the search query (eg, review articles, editorials, 
guideline or position statements, studies of vaccine coverage, immunogenicity, or safety, 
articles on general epidemiology that were not specific to pertussis, basic science studies, 
and studies on diagnosis, treatment, and prophylaxis of pertussis). After full-text review of 
the remaining 95 articles, 63 were excluded because they were duplicate reports of the same 
outbreak or they did not provide data relevant to this review, yielding 32 reports of 
nonoverlapping community or statewide pertussis outbreaks that we used for this summary 
(eFigure 2A in the Supplement).67–98 These reports included 10 609 pertussis cases among 
individuals for whom a vaccination status was reported (age range, 10 days-87 years).
In the 5 largest statewide epidemics, unvaccinated (or undervaccinated) individuals 
comprised a substantial proportion of cases in various age groups. For example, 
investigation of 781 cases during the Arizona pertussis epidemic of 1988 revealed that 33% 
of the 598 cases involving individuals who were age-eligible to have received at least 3 
doses of pertussis-containing vaccine (ie, >6 months) were not appropriately immunized.73 
More recently, during the 2010 California pertussis epidemic, among the 4415 pertussis 
cases in children aged 6 months to 18 years for whom a vaccination history was available, 
2001 children (45%) had not received age-appropriate pertussis-containing vaccines (380 
unvaccinated children and 1621 undervaccinated children).88 Similarly, in Washington in 
2012, among 1829 cases in children aged 3 months to 19 years with available vaccination 
histories, 508 children (28%) were not up-to-date with their pertussis immunizations.87 
Oregon also experienced a pertussis epidemic in 2012, and among the pertussis cases aged 2 
months to 6 years, 31% were unvaccinated and 24% were undervaccinated.92 Finally, during 
the most recent 2014 California pertussis epidemic, of the 222 cases among neonates and 
infants under the age of 12 months with detailed vaccine histories only 53 neonates and 
Phadke et al.

 infants (24%) had received any doses of DTaP, even though more than half (51%) of all the 
infants in this age group were age-eligible (older than 2 months) for pertussis vaccination.93
Similar to the 5 statewide epidemics described above, there were 2 previous statewide 
outbreaks68,71 as well as multiple more geographically restricted outbreaks73,74,83,84,90,92,94 
that also had substantial numbers of unvaccinated case patients; however, we also found 
reports of epidemics within populations with high rates of vaccination 
coverage,72,75,80,81,86,89,98 illustrating the important contribution of waning immunity to 
pertussis to disease epidemiology.86,98 Importantly, there was substantial heterogeneity 
among these reports in the criteria used to identify pertussis cases, the types of vaccine 
available for use at the time (ie, whole cell, acellular, and adult boosters), the proportion of 
cases in which an immunization history was available, the methods used to ascertain 
immunization histories, and how immunization status was described (eg, number of previous 
doses, above or below a threshold number of doses). In addition, owing to the inherent 
challenges of accurately identifying and diagnosing pertussis, chains of transmission could 
not be established in the vast majority of pertussis outbreaks. However, in 2 studies, 
secondary cases among fully vaccinated individuals, whose immunity had presumably 
waned and who likely acquired disease from intentionally unvaccinated individuals, were 
clearly identified.73,94
Only 9 reports (describing 12 pertussis outbreaks) characterized the reason(s) that case 
patients were intentionally unvaccinated or undervaccinated—these reasons included 
personal belief (or philosophical) exemptions (70% of unvaccinated cases in Oregon in 
201292), religious beliefs68 or exemptions (84% of unvaccinated cases in Florida in 201394; 
59%–93% of unvaccinated cases in 4 separate outbreaks in Massachusetts from 1986–
198874), cultural norms (72% unvaccinated in an Amish community in Delaware in 2004–
200584; 79% unvaccinated in an Amish community in Illinois in 2009–201090), illness at the

Vaccine Refusal and Pertussis Risk—We identified 383 articles in the search for 
studies evaluating the association between nonmedical exemptions to routine vaccination 
and the individual or community risk for pertussis. Of these, 359 nonduplicate titles and 
abstracts were reviewed and 350 were excluded, yielding 9 studies that were included in this 
summary (eFigure 2B in the Supplement).10,12,50,99–104 The excluded papers included 
studies not specific to pertussis or to its epidemiology in the United States, review articles, 
opinion pieces, studies of vaccine effectiveness, immunogenicity, or safety, and articles on 
the basic science or clinical aspects of pertussis disease.
Three studies evaluated the individual risk of pertussis associated with vaccine refusal—1 
retrospective cohort study used Colorado pertussis surveillance and immunization data from 
1987–1998 and determined that those with exemptions were 5.9 times more likely to acquire 
pertussis compared with fully vaccinated individuals.50 A different case-control study 
analyzed pertussis cases from 1996–2007 within a large managed care organization and 
computed a nearly 20-fold increased risk of pertussis among individuals with 
exemptions100—11% of the pertussis cases in that cohort were attributed to vaccine refusal.

 Another case-control study used pooled longitudinal data (2004–2010) from 8 Vaccine 
Safety Data link sites and determined that even undervaccinated individuals had an increased 
risk of pertussis, with the risk being proportional to the number of missed doses of DTaP.102
We also found 6 observational studies that showed that high rates of vaccine exemption in a 
community or state are associated with an increased risk of pertussis in that community or 
state compared with communities or states without high rates of vaccine exemptions. For 
example, 4 different state-specific studies—in Colorado,50 Michigan,99 New York,101 and 
California (during the 2010 epidemic)12—all demonstrated that schools and communities 
with high vaccine exemption rates also had higher rates of pertussis. The risk for acquiring 
pertussis was higher even for those who were appropriately vaccinated. More generally, 3 
different ecological studies found that states with allowances for personal belief 
exemptions10 or those with easier exemption processes10,104 have an elevated incidence of 
pertussis (approximately 1.5 times higher in 1 study10) compared with states with difficult 
exemption processes, an association that was confirmed using vaccine-specific uptake 
data.103 This geospatial association between clusters of vaccine refusers and pertussis cases 
cannot be adequately explained by waning immunity because there should not be geographic 
heterogeneity in the duration of protection afforded by pertussis-containing vaccines. 
Together these data therefore suggest an association between high rates of vaccine 
exemption and the sustained transmission of vaccine-preventable diseases in the community 
(Box 2).
Discussion
In this review, unvaccinated or undervaccinated individuals comprised substantial 
proportions of cases in measles and some pertussis outbreaks, and vaccine refusal—as 
measured by population-level vaccine exemption rates—was associated with an elevated risk 
for measles and pertussis, including among fully vaccinated individuals. However, the 
available literature also suggests that vaccine refusal is not the only factor associated with 
outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases, and the relative importance of vaccine refusal 
varies by disease (eg, measles more than pertussis) and epidemiological context (eg, 
prevalence and density of individuals with exemptions in a community).
There are several limitations to our review. A formal assessment of study quality was not 
performed. Most, if not all, of the data on measles and pertussis outbreaks can be accessed 
using publicly available resources. We included several studies that analyzed measles and 
pertussis disease risk in the context of vaccine exemption rates, and such studies are subject 
to multiple important biases common to ecological, case-control, or cohort studies, including 
ascertainment and misclassification bias. However, these limitations would tend to bias 
estimates of disease risk toward the null (eg, classifying fully vaccinated individuals as 
exempted would only underestimate disease risk among those with exemptions). Thus the 
association between high rates of vaccine exemption and measles or pertussis risk is likely to 
be even greater than that reported in previous studies. In addition, given that the evidence for 
waning immunity to pertussis has been previously evaluated,65 and its association with 
disease resurgence has been established,59–64 in this review we focused on the additional 
factor of vaccine refusal.

 This review has broad implications for vaccine practice and policy. For instance, 
fundamental to the strength and legitimacy of justifications to override parental decisions to 
refuse a vaccine for their child is a clear demonstration that the risks and harms to the child 
of remaining unimmunized are substantial. Similarly, central to any justification to restrict 
individual freedom by mandating vaccines to prevent harm to others is an understanding of 
the nature and magnitude of these risks and harms. However, the risks of vaccine refusal 
remain imperfectly defined, and the association between vaccine refusal and vaccine-
preventable diseases may be both population- and disease-specific. Vaccine refusal–specific 
strategies to optimize vaccine uptake could include state or school-level enforcement of 
vaccine mandates, or increasing the difficulty with which vaccine exemptions can be 
obtained. At the same time, immunization policy makers must also address the reasons for 
vaccine hesitancy, which may include parental perceptions regarding the risk and severity of 
vaccine-preventable diseases, the safety and effectiveness of routine immunizations, and 
confidence in medical professionals, corporations, and the health care system.105 
Recognizing the limitations of the existing evidence should not stifle practitioners’ and 
policy makers’ ability to counsel families and craft effective policy, but should serve as 
motivation to develop, refine, and improve disease surveillance, detection, and outcomes-
based research.
Conclusions
A substantial proportion of the US measles cases in the era after elimination were 
intentionally unvaccinated. The phenomenon of vaccine refusal was associated with an 
increased risk for measles among people who refuse vaccines and among fully vaccinated 
individuals. Although pertussis resurgence has been attributed to waning immunity and other 
factors, vaccine refusal was still associated with an increased risk for pertussis in some 
populations.
