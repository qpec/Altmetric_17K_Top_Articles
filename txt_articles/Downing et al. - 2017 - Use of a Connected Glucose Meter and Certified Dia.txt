Abstract
Background: The Livongo for Diabetes Program offers members (1) a cellular technology-enabled, two-way messaging device
that measures blood glucose (BG), centrally stores the glucose data, and delivers messages back to the individual in real time;
(2) unlimited BG test strips; and (3) access to a diabetes coaching team for questions, goal setting, and automated support for
abnormal glucose excursions. The program is sponsored by at-risk self-insured employers, health plans and provider organizations
where it is free to members with diabetes or it is available directly to the person with diabetes where they cover the cost.
Objective: The objective of our study was to evaluate BG data from 4544 individuals with diabetes who were enrolled in the
Livongo program from October 2014 through December 2015.
Methods: Members used the Livongo glucose meter to measure their BG levels an average of 1.8 times per day. We estimated
the probability of having a day with a BG reading outside of the normal range (70-180 mg/dL, or 3.9-10.0 mmol/L) in months 2
to 12 compared with month 1 of the program, using individual fixed effects to control for individual characteristics.
Results: Livongo members experienced an average 18.4% decrease in the likelihood of having a day with hypoglycemia (BG
<70 mg/dL) and an average 16.4% decrease in hyperglycemia (BG >180 mg/dL) in months 2-12 compared with month 1 as the
baseline. The biggest impact was seen on hyperglycemia for nonusers of insulin. We do not know all of the contributing factors
such as medication or other treatment changes during the study period.
Conclusions: These findings suggest that access to a connected glucose meter and certified diabetes educator coaching is
associated with a decrease in the likelihood of abnormal glucose excursions, which can lead to diabetes-related health care savings.

Introduction
Diabetes mellitus affects over 387 million people worldwide.
Its prevalence has increased dramatically over the past two
decades (from 9.8% to 12.4% in the United States), with the
costs of diabetes now estimated at over US $150 billion annually
in the United States [1-3]. Blood glucose (BG) excursions out
of the normal range (70-180 mg/dL, or 3.9-10.0 mmol/L [4])
are important drivers of these extraordinary costs, often leading
to unnecessary emergency department visits, hospitalization,
urgent care visits, and office visits as well as missed work days.
Self-monitoring of BG (SMBG) is an integral part of successful
diabetes management. Self-monitoring of BG has been
demonstrated to be a beneficial approach for the achievement

 of long-term glycemic control in patients with both type 1 [5]
and type 2 diabetes [6]. It also supports preventive strategies
for acute and chronic complications of diabetes by increasing
a patient’s awareness of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia [7].
Traditional BG meters provide glucose measurements and store
these data within the meter. These data must be actively retrieved
and analyzed by the user, health care provider, software, or
mobile app to guide treatment decisions [3,8-10]. The Livongo
for Diabetes Program, currently available in the United States
which is offered directly to patients or as a benefit through their
self-insured employer, provider, or health insurance, leverages
cloud 
technology 
to 
offer 
patients 
(1) 
a 
cellular
technology-enabled, two-way messaging device that measures
BG, centrally stores the glucose data and other contextual data,
and delivers relevant algorithmic messages back to the
individual; (2) unlimited glucose test strips, and (3) access to a
team of certified diabetes educators (CDEs) for questions, goal
setting, and immediate support in the setting of extreme glucose
excursions.
An “alert” interaction between patients and a Livongo CDE
coach occurs when a BG value transmitted through the meter
is over 400 mg/dL (22.2 mmol/L) or below 50 mg/dL (2.8
mmol/L), or whatever thresholds a member elects.
Approximately 27% of the members have received alert outreach
from the CDE team. Patients may also interact with a Livongo
CDE coach through a telephonic, one-to-one scheduled coaching
session. Over 10% of members have completed at least one of
these scheduled coaching sessions.
Other educational interactions include algorithmic, personalized
messages that are sent through the meter in response to each
BG reading. For example, if a BG value is below 50 mg/dL, the
message on the BG meter will read “Your reading is very low,
drink 4 oz of juice or take 4 glucose tabs and check BG again
in 15 minutes.” If the BG value is above 400 mg/dL, the message
will read “Drink a glass of water, take medication as prescribed
and check BG again in 30 minutes.”
We hypothesized that the tools provided to Livongo members
would decrease the likelihood of BG excursions outside of the
normal glucose range (70-180 mg/dL or 3.9-10.0 mmol/L).
Methods
Study Design and Data
We collected registration data from individuals with diabetes
who enrolled in the program between October 1, 2014 and
December 30, 2015. This member-input data included sex, date
of birth, diabetes type, insulin use, date of diagnoses, and other
health-related information.
We collected BG data on each member using a cellular,
cloud-connected BG meter that was shipped to each individual
with test strips after registration. The BG readings and
member-input details (such as how the member is feeling;
relation of BG reading to meal or exercise, insulin taken,
carbohydrates eaten) were automatically transmitted to the cloud
in real time. All members used the same version of the glucose
meter, and no significant device changes were made during the
study period. Members with fewer than two total glucose
readings were excluded from the analysis because no BG
comparison could be made over time. No specific guidelines
about BG testing frequency were given to members; rather, they
were instructed to follow their health care provider’s advice.
Key Variables
The main outcomes of interest were binary variables derived
from the BG values collected from the meter. We defined a day
with hyperglycemia as having at least one BG measure above
180 mg/dL in that day. We defined a day with hypoglycemia
as having at least one BG measure below 70 mg/dL in that day.
We linked key variables from the registration data with the BG
data using the individual identifier. These variables were age,
sex (female, male), diabetes type (type 1, type 2, and unknown),
and insulin use.
Statistical Methods
We fit a series of logistic regression models to understand the
predicted probability of hyperglycemia (days with BG >180
mg/dL) or hypoglycemia (days with BG <70 mg/dL) in months
2 to 12 compared with month 1.
In the absence of BG data prior to enrollment in Livongo, we
used month 1 as a proxy for baseline. We hypothesized that
members would have a lower probability of hyperglycemic and
hypoglycemic events as their time in the program increased.
We included a fixed effect for each individual in order to control
for all unobserved heterogeneity across members that may be
correlated with the independent variables (ie, presence of a day
with hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia in a given month),
including lifestyle or the propensity to use technology that might
influence BG control [11]. That is, Yit= βoi + β2month2 +
β3month3 +…+ β12month12 + εit, where Yit is member-days with
BG >180 or <70 mg/dL for individual i in month t; βoi is the
individual intercept that is swept out in the fixed-effects model;
and βs… β12 represents the effects in months 2 to 12 compared
with month 1.
Next, we stratified participants by insulin use, diabetes type,
sex, insulin use, and age group (18-44, 54-64, ≥65). We
conducted all modeling and statistical analyses using Stata 13
(StataCorp LP).
Results
Of 4974 total Livongo members, 4544 had at least two BG
measures during the period and were included in the analysis.
Over the entire study period, members were enrolled for a mean
of 95 days, and the mean total number of BG measurements
was 114. Table 1 reports descriptive statistics for the sample
population and Figure 1 shows the distribution of time in the
program across members.

Over the entire time period, the mean proportion of days with
a BG value above 180 mg/dL was 33.4% with a within-person
standard deviation of 35.2% and between-person standard
deviation of 34.2%. The mean proportion of days with a BG
value below 70 was 6.1% with a within-person standard
deviation of 20.4% and a between-person standard deviation of
11.9%. More than half of individuals were female (55%), 15.6%
had type 1 diabetes, 37.5% used insulin, and over half of the
population (52.1%) had been active on Livongo for 4 or more
months at the time of the analysis.
The mean BG for the entire population was 152 (SD 54) mg/dL
(8.4, SD 3.0 mmol/L) over the 12 months and it was significantly
higher for members with type 1 (163 mg/dL, or 9.0 mmol/L)
compared to those with type 2 diabetes (150 mg/dL, or 8.3
mmol/L P<.001).
Figure 2 displays the predicted probabilities of hyperglycemia
and hypoglycemia for the entire population. On average, the
likelihood of having a day with a high BG reading (>180 mg/dL)
in months 2-12 was 16.4% lower than in month 1. Specifically,
in month 3, the likelihood of having a day with a hyperglycemic
event was 21% lower than in month 1 (95% CI –0.195 to
–0.131). For hypoglycemia, for each month, the likelihood of
having a low BG reading (<70 mg/dL) was 18.4% lower than
in month 1. In month 9, for example, the likelihood of having
a hypoglycemic event was 29% lower (95% CI –0.105 to
–0.018).

 average by 8.4% and the likelihood of hypoglycemia decreased
by 12.5% in months 2-12 compared with month 1 (Figure 3,
top). Individuals who reported not using insulin at registration
experienced the biggest reduction in days with hyperglycemia
by 25.2%, but also experienced an overall increase in
hypoglycemic events of 6.7% starting in month 6 of the program
(Figure 3, bottom). Changes in medication use were not
systematically captured from individuals during the study period.
Discussion
Our findings show that use of a technology-enabled connected
glucose meter combined with open access to CDE support is
effective in improving BG excursions for a diverse real-world
population of adults with diabetes. Health care delivery based
on episodic, in-person interactions between health care teams
and patients does not fully address the real-time needs of patients
with diabetes [12], which is a data-intensive condition requiring
continuous management and the support of a multidisciplinary
team. Tools provided by Livongo enable patients with diabetes
to track their progress, and to collaborate with their providers
and others such as family and friends who are positioned to
provide critical support for patients who want to take an active
role 
in 
managing 
their 
health. 
Additionally, 
this
self-management program, like other technology-enabled
solutions, can be a cost-effective strategy by empowering
patients with engaging tools.
The limitations of this analysis include, first, that we did not
have BG data for members prior to their enrollment in the
Livongo program. We therefore used the first month of program
participation as a proxy for baseline. This may underestimate
the program’s impact, and our results should be interpreted as
conservative.
Second, we were unable to capture medication or other treatment
changes that can affect BG excursions, which could be relevant
to the increased likelihood of hypoglycemia seen in members
who reported not using insulin at the beginning of the program.
In this group, 77.00% (3499/4544) of members reported taking
oral medications and 16.99% (772/4544) reported taking no
diabetes-related medications at baseline. Improved medication
adherence and optimization of these members’ medication
regimen to include starting insulin or an oral medication, such
as a sulfonylurea, that can cause hypoglycemia could explain
this finding.
Third, 
examination 
of 
overall 
diabetes 
control 
by
laboratory-based hemoglobin A1c assessment would have been
useful to better understand whether the reduced frequency of
hyperglycemic events in people with type 2 diabetes drove
overall hemoglobin A1c improvement, since the magnitude of
either hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia was not factored into
our model.
In summary, we examined a real-world population of people
with diabetes using the connected Livongo meter and the
Livongo for Diabetes Program to support diabetes self-care.
Using the first month of the program as a baseline, the likelihood
of both having a day with BG below 70 mg/dL and having a
day with BG above 180 mg/dL decreased across the population.
This is an important finding, as extreme hypoglycemic and
hyperglycemic excursions are significant drivers of quality of
life and health care costs for people with diabetes.
