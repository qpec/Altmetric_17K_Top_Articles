Summary
The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to estimate the
prevalence of personal weight control attempts (weight loss and/or maintenance)
worldwide and to identify correlates, personal strategies used and the underlying
motives. We included epidemiological/observational studies of adults (≥18 years)
reporting prevalence of weight control attempts in the past-year. Seventy-two
studies (n = 1,184,942) met eligibility criteria. Results from high quality studies
showed that 42% of adults from general populations and 44% of adults from
ethnic-minority populations reported trying to lose weight, and 23% of adults from
general populations reported trying to maintain weight annually. In general
population studies, higher prevalence of weight loss attempts was observed in the
decade
of
2000–2009
(48.2%),
in
Europe/Central
Asia
(61.3%)
and
in
overweight/obese individuals and in women (p < 0.01). Of the 37 strategies
(grouped in 10 domains of the Oxford Food and Activity Behaviours Taxonomy)
and 12 motives reported for trying to control weight, exercising and dieting (within
the energy compensation and restraint domains, respectively) and wellbeing and
long-term health were the most prevalent. To our knowledge, this is the first
systematic review to investigate weight control attempts worldwide. Key strategies
and motives were identified which have implications for future public health initiatives
on weight control.
Keywords: Maintenance, motives, strategies, weight loss.
Introduction
The causes of obesity are complex and multifaceted.
Obesity control interventions usually focus on a combina-
tion of physical and dietary aspects of social, economic
and
cultural
environments
together
with
individual
approaches (1,2). Personal weight control efforts (i.e.
intentionally trying to lose or maintain weight) are of
particular relevance for public health as they reflect an
active investment of the population and provide an oppor-
tunity to guide individuals to evidence-based weight control
approaches.
In other areas of public health (e.g. smoking cessation), a
focus on personal behaviour change attempts (e.g. quit
smoking) has been key to understanding and enhancing
effects of public health strategies (3). The relationship
between personal weight loss attempts and obesity is
complex, and well-informed attempts to lose weight (e.g.
those utilizing evidence-based weight loss strategies) may
result in better weight loss and maintenance (1,4). However,
there is also consistent evidence that amongst obese adults
the number of weight loss attempts is a negative predictor
of success in weight loss interventions (5). Recurrent weight
control efforts may negatively impact on self-concept, body

 image, pessimistic attributions and feelings of helplessness,
all of which could predispose individuals to failure (6,7).
Therefore, it is important to understand how many weight
control attempts are made, by whom, how and why, in
order to provide a clearer knowledge base about what peo-
ple seeking weight control are currently doing (and why)
and inform public health policies and interventions regard-
ing changes that need to occur in weight loss/maintenance
attempts to improve population outcomes.
This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to (i) syn-
thesize the available epidemiological data on the prevalence
of weight control (weight loss and weight maintenance)
attempts among adults worldwide; (ii) provide a compre-
hensive description of the personal strategies used and (iii)
describe the motives behind those attempts. To our knowl-
edge, this is the first study providing such a perspective.
Methods
This systematic review and meta-analysis is reported in
accordance with The Joanna Briggs Institute Reviewers’
Manual 2014 for systematic reviews of prevalence and
incidence data (8). Methodological aspects of this review
were specified in advance and documented in a protocol
(PROSPERO registration number: CRD42014010572).
Eligibility criteria
Studies were selected for this review if they were population-
based epidemiological/observational studies that included
samples of adults (≥18 years old). To be eligible, studies
should also include a question on the prevalence of weight
control (loss and/or maintenance1) attempts within a
12-month period preceding the survey (e.g. ‘Are you
currently trying to lose weight?’, ‘Have you tried to lose
weight in the past 6 months?’, ‘Have you tried to lose weight
in the last year?’, ‘Are you now trying to maintain your
weight, that is, to keep from gaining weight?’, ‘Have you
tried to keep from gaining weight during the previous
12 months?’). Past year prevalence was chosen instead of
ever prevalence because it has a greater potential to reflect
changing patterns over time and capture differences (e.g.
between geographical regions). Studies of pregnant women
(or women within 1-year postpartum), athletes and popula-
tions with specific health conditions, disabilities or mental
disorders were excluded.
Search strategy and study selection
A comprehensive search of peer-reviewed articles was
conducted in three electronic databases: PubMed, PsycInfo
and Web of Science (all articles published until December
2015). Searches included various combinations of the
following terms: weight control, weight loss, weight mainte-
nance, diet, attempts, prevalence, strategies, practices, deter-
minants and motives (Full search strategy is available from
the authors upon request). The search was limited to studies
with participants aged 18 years and older. There were no
restrictions regarding the language of publication. Addition-
ally, manual cross-referencing of retrieved articles and
hand-searches of key scientific journals (e.g. International
Journal of Public Health, American Journal of Preventive
Medicine) were performed.
Potentially eligible studies were independently identified
by two authors (IS, EVC), based on titles, abstracts and
references.
Duplicate
entries
were
removed.
Relevant
articles were then retrieved for a full-text review. The same
two researchers independently reviewed the full-text of
potential
studies
and
discrepancies
were
resolved
by
consensus. Endnote® X7 for Mac® OS X® was used to
manage the references.
Methodological quality
The methodological quality of included studies was assessed
using a standardized form based on a short version of The
Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal checklist for
studies reporting prevalence data (8), consisting of a
five-category tool addressing critical issues of internal and
external validity of prevalence data, including (i) representa-
tiveness of the sample; (ii) appropriate recruitment of study
participants; (iii) adequacy of sample size; (iv) non-response
and refusals and (v) use of a standard criteria for the mea-
surement of the condition. For each study, each category
of the checklist was classified as Yes, No, Unclear or Not
applicable. No corresponds to a limitation in the respective
methodological category. Two of three researches (IS, MM
and EVC) independently assessed the methodological qual-
ity of each study and discussed the results of their critical
appraisals. Disagreements were resolved by consensus.
Data extraction
The Joanna Briggs Institute data extraction form for
prevalence and incidence studies (8) was used to extract
relevant information. Data extraction included information
about (i) study details (authors, year, publication journal);
(ii) study methods (design, mode of data collection, year of
survey, geographical region, setting); (iii) subject character-
istics
(sample
size,
age,
gender,
percentage
of
overweight/obesity, response rate) and (iv) outcomes of
interest
(prevalence
of
weight
loss
and
maintenance
attempts, strategies used and motives reported by those
trying to control their weight).
1Maintenance does not necessarily imply previous weight loss.

 Data synthesis and statistical analyses
We conducted separate meta-analyses for the prevalence of
weight loss and weight maintenance attempts in (i) general
populations and (ii) ethnic-minority populations.
Analyses were conducted using the Comprehensive Meta-
Analysis Software version 2.2 (9). Meta-analyses were con-
ducted using random-effects models, in which the summary
effect is an estimate of the mean of a distribution of effect
sizes (10). Pooled effects were the prevalence estimates of
weight loss and maintenance attempts (represented as event
rate plus confidence intervals). To evaluate the amount of
variation in the effects of included studies, we inspected
for heterogeneity using: (i) the Cochran’s Q statistic (11),
for which a significant p-value (<0.05) demonstrates that
studies do not share a common effect size (i.e. there is het-
erogeneity in the effect sizes between studies); and (ii) I2 sta-
tistic
(12)
that
assesses
the
proportion
of
observed
dispersion that is because of real differences in the actual ef-
fect sizes (rather than sampling error). The I2 ranges from 0
to 100%, where a value of 0% indicates no observed het-
erogeneity and values of 25%, 50% and 75% reflect low,
moderate and high heterogeneity, respectively.
Subgroup analyses were conducted to examine whether
prevalence estimates varied according to the decade of the
survey (1970–1979, 1980–1989, 1990–1999, 2000–2009
and 2010–2015) and the geographic region where the
survey took place (coded according with the World Bank
Atlas as Africa, East Asia and Pacific, Europe and Central
Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, Middle East and
North Africa, North America and South Asia). These
subgroup analyses were conducted using mixed-effect
models (i.e. random-effects model is conducted within
subgroups and a fixed effect model was used across sub-
groups) (10). Between-groups Q statistic and corresponding
p-values were used to compare the mean effect across sub-
groups.
Further,
meta-regressions
using
mixed-effects
models were conducted to analyse the moderation effect of
the following continuous variables: (i) percentage of over-
weight and obese individuals in the sample; (ii) percentage
of women in the sample and (iii) mean age of the sample.
Meta-regressions were conducted when there were at least
10 studies/analyses and were analysed based on the Z-value
and associated p-value of the slope (10). Because of the
limited number of studies reporting the prevalence of weight
maintenance
attempts,
we
only
conducted
moderator
analyses for the prevalence of weight loss attempts.
Some studies did not provide separated prevalence rates
of weight loss and maintenance attempts and did not
include sufficient data (e.g. mean age) for subgroup analyses
and meta-regression. Therefore, the number of studies
included in moderation analyses varies.
Personal weight control strategies and motives reported
by those trying to control their weight in the past year were
qualitatively synthetized and presented in tabular form.
Personal weight control strategies were independently
classified within the domains of the Oxford Food and
Activity Behaviours (OxFAB) Taxonomy (13) by two of
three researchers (IS, MM and EVC) and discrepancies were
resolved by consensus. This taxonomy was chosen because
it is a comprehensive tool to systematically describe the
cognitive and behavioural strategies used by individuals
for weight management (13). Only the domains where at
least one strategy fell on were shown. Two additional
domains were included – dietary choices and extreme
strategies – as some of the reported strategies did not fit
within any existing domain. Likewise, some strategies
seemed to fit in more than one domain; nevertheless, we
have selected the one that appeared more appropriate.
Weight control motives were independently extracted by
two of three researchers (IS, MM and EVC).
Sensitivity analyses
Sensitivity analyses were carried out to explore if overall
results were affected by methodological quality. Primary
analyses
were
repeated
excluding
studies
presenting
methodological limitations in either and in all (cumulative)
categories of the The Joanna Briggs Institute critical
appraisal checklist for studies reporting prevalence data
(8). Moderation analyses were also repeated excluding all
studies presenting methodological limitations.
Publication bias was examined by (i) visual inspection of
funnel plot and asymmetry and (ii) Egger’s test (14) to
confirm the visual impression.
Results
The literature search yielded a total of 9,759 records.
Sixteen articles identified through manual searches and
cross-referencing were added, leading to a total of 9,775
potential
articles
(Fig.
1).
After
duplicate
removal
(n = 3,818), 5,957 articles were assessed for eligibility. Of
these, 5,781 were excluded based on title/abstract screening,
leaving 176 eligible for full-text screening. Seventy-two
articles with a total sample size of 1,184,942 met eligible
criteria and were included.
Study and sample characteristics
Characteristics of included studies are summarized in
Table 1. Sixty studies were conducted within general
populations and 12 within ethnic-minority populations.
Most studies had a cross-sectional design (k = 67), and the
remaining five studies were prospective cohorts. Surveys
were
conducted
between
1975
and
2013
across
40
countries within five continents, and data was collected via
in-person/self-administered (k = 41), telephone (k = 17), mail

surveys.
Sixty-two
studies
included mixed-gender samples, nine included only women
and one study was conducted only with men. Eleven studies
targeted overweight and obese individuals only. Sample
sizes in the studies ranged from 123 to 170,971 participants
and response rates from 24% to 97.7%.
Methodological appraisal
Table 1 shows the limitations regarding methodological
quality of the included studies. In 22 (general population:
14; ethnic minorities: 8) of the 72 included studies, the
population was not representative of the country, region
or setting where the studies were conducted (Category 1).
In 15 studies (general population: 8; ethnic minorities: 7),
participants were not randomly selected and/or were not
recruited from an appropriate source (Category 2). Sample
size calculation (Category 3) was not performed in 25
studies (general population: 16; ethnic minorities: 9).
Furthermore,
in
23
studies
(general
population:
16;
ethnic
minorities:
7)
there
was
no
information
on
response/refusals
rate
and/or
no
comparison
between
responders and non-responders (Category 4). All studies
presented a standard criterion for the measurement of
weight control attempts and therefore none presented
limitations in this regard (Category 5).
Prevalence of weight control attempts
Prevalence rates of weight loss and weight maintenance
attempts varied widely across studies, ranging from 9.5%
(21) to 73.8% (33) and 10.4% (58) to 42.1% (36),
respectively (Table 1). Five studies did not report separate
prevalence rates of weight loss and maintenance attempts.
The overall prevalence of weight control (i.e. loss plus
maintenance) attempts ranged between 37% (22) and
81.5% (36).
General population studies
The overall summary prevalence of weight loss and
maintenance attempts in general populations was 34.6%
(95%

24.7%
(95%
CI
[23.7%,
31.7%];
Q = 5,737, p < 0.001; I2 = 99.8%), respectively. Sensitivity
analysis showed that excluding studies with limitations in cat-
egories 1 and 3 led to substantial changes in the overall prev-
alence
estimates
of
weight
loss
attempts
in
general
populations: +7.0% (k = 44) and +7.5% (k = 42), respectively.
Excluding studies with limitations in categories 2 and 4 led to
minimal changes: �0.9% (k = 50) and �1.7% (k = 42), re-
spectively. Figure 2 presents the overall results excluding all
studies with limitations in any methodological category. The
pooled estimate for the prevalence of weight loss attempts in
general populations was 41.5% (95% CI [38.7%, 44.4%];
Q = 27,947, p < 0.001; I2 = 99.9%; k = 34).
For the overall prevalence estimates of weight mainte-
nance attempts in general populations, excluding studies
with limitations led to minimal changes (from �1.5% to
+0.1%). The combined estimate excluding studies with
limitations in any methodological category was 23.2%
(95%
CI
[18.8%,
28.3%];
Q = 4,838,
p < 0.001;
I2 = 99.8%; k = 10).
Regarding publication bias, visual inspections of the
funnel plots did not show the presence of asymmetry, which
was confirmed with Egger’s test (all p > 0.05), either for the
prevalence of weight loss or maintenance attempts in
general populations.
Table 2 presents the results of the subgroup analyses. A
clear significant increase in the prevalence of weight loss
attempts across decades is observed (from 18.6% to
47.7%, Q = 138.454, p < 0.001), until the decade of
2000–2009. Between 2010 and 2015 the combined preva-
lence was 24.1%. High heterogeneity and large proportion
of dispersion in the prevalence rates was observed within

 subgroups
(I2
varied
between
98.8%
and
99.8%).
Sensitivity analysis showed that excluding studies with any
methodological limitation led to important changes in the
overall prevalence estimates of weight loss attempts in the
decade of 2010–2015 (increased to 39.7%). For the other
decades, changes were small.
There were significant differences in the prevalence of
weight
loss
attempts
between
geographic
regions
(Q = 108.335, p < 0.001), in which the highest overall
prevalence was found in North America (44%, 95% CI
[41%, 47.1%]) and the lowest in Africa (16.6%, 95% CI
[12.7%, 21.4%]) (Table 2). All subgroups presented signif-
icant heterogeneity and large proportion of dispersion in the
prevalence rates (I2 varied between 93.1% and 99.9%).
Sensitivity analysis showed that the prevalence of weight
loss attempts in Europe and Central Asia and in Latin
America and the Caribbean, excluding studies with any
methodological limitation, was much higher: from 31.5%
to 61.3% and from 20.6% to 26.6%, respectively. Slight
changes were observed in East Asia and Pacific and in
North America (�1.4%).
Combined prevalence of weight loss attempts increased
significantly with the prevalence of overweight and obesity
(b = 0.018; p < 0.001), with the percentage of women in
the samples (b = 0.011; p = 0.001) and with mean age
(b = 0.038; p < 0.001). Sensitivity analysis showed that
when excluding all the studies with methodological limita-
tions, only the association between weight loss attempts
and mean age became non significant.
Ethnic-minority population studies
Overall results of the meta-analysis for the prevalence of
weight loss attempts in ethnic minorities showed a pooled
estimate
of
39.6%
(95%
CI
[29.7%,
50.4%];
Q = 867.199, p < 0.001; I2 = 98.7%). Combined prevalence
of weight maintenance attempts was 21.1% (95% CI
[19.2%, 23.2%]; Q = 147,583, p < 0.001; I2 = 98.6%).
Sensitivity analysis showed that excluding all studies with
methodological limitations led to an increase in the overall
prevalence of weight loss attempts of 4.5% (44.1%; k = 3).
All of the studies reporting maintenance attempts presented
methodological limitations.
Subgroup analyses by decade of survey showed a preva-
lence of weight loss attempts of 40% between 1980 and
1989, 48.5% between 1990 and 1999 and 44.9% between
2000 and 2009 (Table 3). Subgroup analyses by geo-
graphic region revealed a prevalence of weight loss at-
tempts of 35.6% in Europe and Central Asia and 41% in
North America (Table 3). For both analyses, there were
no
significant
differences
between
groups
(Q = 0.415,
p = 0.813 and Q = 0.305, p = 0.581, respectively). Meta-
regressions by mean age and percentage of women in the
samples were also not significant (b = 0.042; p = 0.118
and b = �0.009; p = 0.440, respectively). Because only three
studies did not present methodological limitations, we did
not conduct sensitivity analyses for this set of moderation
analyses.

 by those trying to control their weight (Table 4). Thirty-
seven strategies were identified across studies, which were
grouped in 10 domains of the OxFAB Taxonomy. Doing
or increasing physical activity – the only strategy that fell
in the energy compensation domain – was the most
frequently assessed strategy (k = 27 for trying to lose and
k = 7 for trying to maintain weight), and results show that
this strategy was used by the majority of participants across
studies. Dieting – within the restraint domain – was the
second most assessed strategy for trying to lose weight
(k = 20) and was even more frequently reported: more than
two-thirds of participants attempted to lose weight using
this strategy. All other strategies were assessed by 1 to 14
studies. The domain that combined more strategies was
the regulation – restrictions (k ranged between 1 and 9):
from 12% to 66% of participants and from 2% to 64%
of participants reported avoiding or restricting specific
foods or behaviours for trying to lose and maintain weight,
respectively. Dietary choices (k = 1–4) and weight manage-
ment aids (k = 1–14) were the other domains were more
strategies fell on: from 39% to 85% of participants reported
choosing specific dietary behaviours and from 1% to 25%
of participants reported using some aid to try to lose weight;
from 36% to 87% of participants reported choosing spe-
cific dietary behaviours and from 1% to 6% of participants
reported using some aid to try to maintain weight.
Weight control motives
Of the 72 included studies, only seven from general popula-
tions reported motives for trying to lose and/or maintain
weight (Table 5). To improve appearance and to improve
health and prevent future diseases were the most frequently
assessed motives for trying to lose weight (k = 5), although
to improve wellbeing was the most frequently reported
motive (95%), followed by to improve fitness condition or
staying fit (85%) and to improve self-esteem (74%). The
most frequently reported motive for trying to maintain
weight was to improve health and prevent future diseases
(98%), followed by to improve wellbeing (91%), to
improve fitness condition or staying fit (87%), to improve
appearance (80%) and to improve self-esteem (71%). All
other motives (e.g. to please or by insistence of spouse/part-
ner, because of health professional advice) were listed by
less than 50% of participants.
Discussion
This comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis
sought to estimate the prevalence of weight control attempts
among adults worldwide, and identify potential correlates,
personal strategies used and the underlying motivations.
Seventy-two studies with more than a million participants
were included, showing that weight is a matter of concern
to a significant portion of the population. Results from high
quality studies showed that about 42% of adults from gen-
eral populations and 44% of adults from ethnic-minority
populations reported trying to lose weight, and about
23% of adults from general populations reported trying to
maintain weight at some point in time. Significant differ-
ences were found between decades and geographic regions:
higher prevalence rates of weight loss attempts among
adults from general populations occurred in the decade of
2000–2009 and in Europe and Central Asia. In the last five
years (2010–2015), about 40% of adults from general pop-
ulations reported trying to lose weight. As expected, higher
prevalence of weight loss attempts among adults was
observed in overweight and obese persons and in women.
Across populations, 37 different personal strategies were
reported for managing weight, standing out physical activ-
ity participation and dieting, which were classified, respec-
tively,
within
the
energy
compensation
and
restraint
domains of the OxFAB Taxonomy. Finally, 12 different
motives for trying to manage weight were cited, the most
common being increasing wellbeing and achieving long-
term health.
To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review and
meta-analysis presenting comprehensive estimates of the
prevalence of weight loss and maintenance attempts and de-
scribing the related factors among adults across the globe.
This is of considerable relevance because accurate informa-
tion in this area should assist in the evaluation of changes
and trends worldwide, in setting priorities for public health
initiatives and in planning management of weight control
services.

*Prevalence indicates the number of respondents out of n study sample that reported using strategies for trying to lose or maintain weight.
1Study (46) was not accounted for sample size or prevalence rate in this strategy because of assessment differences (several low-calorie foods were assessed separately).
2Studies (52,65) were not accounted for sample size or prevalence rates because they did not report separate values for trying to lose and maintain weight.
3Studies (20,40,70,77) were not accounted for sample size or prevalence rates because of assessment differences (only the key method was assessed).
4Studies (24,55,63,74) were not accounted for sample size or prevalence rates because they did not have sufficient data available.
5Study (35) was not accounted for sample size or prevalence rates in this strategy because of assessment differences (only the key method was assessed).
6Studies (15,16) were not accounted for sample size or prevalence rates in this strategy because of assessment differences (fasting was assessed together with skipping meals).
7Study (58) was not accounted for sample size or prevalence rate in this strategy because of assessment differences (vomiting was assessed together with the use of laxatives).
**Exercise/physical activity was considered in the Energy Compensation domain because this strategy is commonly used to compensate energy intake as a way to control weight.

 Prevalence of weight control attempts
The overall summary of prevalence results in general popu-
lations mirrors the overweight and obesity trends world-
wide: prevalence rates have increased in the last decades
and are higher in Europe/Central Asia and in the US (87).
The prevalence of weight loss attempts appears to have
peaked in the beginning of the 2000s. Factors that explain
the growing prevalence of weight loss attempts in the start
of this millennium may include changes in social norms
regarding obesity, an increase in the number of products
and services targeting weight management or greater impor-
tance attributed by the population to weight or body shape
and health. The significant differences observed between
geographic regions may also be linked to the cultural con-
text of each region, as well as to the physical environment
and socioeconomic condition, as these factors may influence
the development of health-promoting behaviours. For
example, individuals from higher socioeconomic groups
and with higher levels of education are more likely to try
to control their weight (88,89), perhaps because they are
exposed to social advantages such as access to weight loss
services,
higher
affordability
of
healthy
choices
and
knowledge, which collectively facilitate the adoption of
energy-balance related behaviours (90,91). Our findings
also highlight the role of gender on weight-related aspects,
with more women attempting to lose weight than men.
One possible explanation for this is that social norms and
cultural pressures to be thin especially affect women (92),
or
that
women
with
normal
weight
often
perceive
themselves as being overweight (65) and consequently
engage in more efforts to become or remain thin.
Although the prevalence of overweight and obesity is
particularly high in some ethnic-minority groups (93), the
overall summary prevalence of weight loss attempts in this
population was only slightly different than that observed
in general populations (+2.6%), apparently presenting its
peak also in the beginning of the 2000s. One possible
justification is a difference in attitudes and cultural norms
regarding weight: for example, previous studies have shown
that non-Hispanic black and Hispanic women are more
satisfied with their body size than Caucasian women, and
individuals who are satisfied with their body size are less
likely to try to lose weight (94). However, it should be noted
that the limited number of studies without methodological
limitations (k = 3, n = 3,217) reduces the confidence in the
results, compared with the analyses with general popula-
tions (k = 34, n = 1,062,133). Also, the limited number of
studies with ethnic-minority populations limits the conclu-
sions that can be drawn from the moderator analyses
because we could not test whether the prevalence of weight
loss attempts varied with the prevalence of overweight and
obesity, and the non-significant effects found may be due
to low statistical power (10).
Personal weight control strategies
The most consistently assessed strategies, which were used
by the majority of individuals trying to lose and maintain
weight, were related with increasing energy expenditure
and reducing energy intake, in line with evidence-based
guidelines for weight management (1). Other strategies
related with improving the quality of the diet – by increasing
the consumption of healthy foods (e.g. eating more fruits
and vegetables) or restricting the consumption of unhealthy
foods (e.g. eating less sugary foods) – were moderately
assessed across studies, and also frequently reported,

 although they may or may not have an impact on body
weight (e.g. (95)). Importantly, several weight management
aids – weight loss pills or supplements, laxatives or
diuretics, diet products and meal replacements – and also
more extreme strategies – fasting or vomiting – were
reported by a low percentage of individuals, mostly for
trying to lose weight. This is encouraging in suggesting that
in the adult population worldwide, weight control appears
to be more associated with health-promoting rather than
potentially harmful strategies. With the exception of a few
of these strategies (e.g. some weight loss pills (96)), there is
no scientific evidence suggesting their effectiveness (e.g.
(59,97,98)), and they may be associated with weight cycling
and regain over time (99), and with eating disorders (100).
Weight control motives
Based on the present findings, the public health message on
managing weight for long-term health, preventing disease,
general wellbeing or improving fitness seem to have been
endorsed across populations. However, reasons such as
enhancing
appearance,
conforming
to
external
request/demands (spouse or doctor), and avoiding discrimi-
nation were also relatively common. Considering the
positive role that more internal motives (e.g. health and
wellbeing) appear to have on long-term weight control
and related behaviours (101,102), the large endorsement
of relatively external motives (e.g. social pressure, even
protecting one’s self-esteem from prejudice) may be a cause
for concern. Research has now clearly shown that having a
more positive body image, not feeling pressured or discrim-
inated against, and losing weight mostly for autonomous
(i.e. more internal) reasons pay off in increased adherence
to weight-healthy behaviours and higher success rates
(103–105).
Strengths and limitations
The present review has a number of strengths but also some
limitations. First, while it includes a large number of epide-
miological studies, which make the findings robust, they are
not all nationally representative and response rates varied
considerably among studies, leading to inexact overall prev-
alence rates. Although nationally representative samples are
preferable, not including the regional representative and the
non-representative samples would limit our results in terms
of time points and geographical regions for which nation-
ally representative data is not available. We performed
sensitivity analyses, repeating the analyses without the
studies with methodological limitations, in an attempt to
partially overcome this limitation.
Second, although surveys have several advantages – they
are the standard way of gathering prevalence data, are
relatively cheap to administer, information is uniform
across the years and privacy can be maintained – they also
have disadvantages. These include being subject to social
desirability and selection bias towards more motivated indi-
viduals; they are also sensitive to the target groups’ literacy
level (106). Also, surveys were administered in different
ways across studies – electronically, via mail, telephone or
in person – which could impact final results. Third,
although important potential moderators of weight control
attempts were tested – percentage of women in the samples,
percentage of overweight individuals in the samples, age,
geographic region and decade of survey – other variables
with potential moderator effect were not assessed, such as
socioeconomic status or education level. The main reason
for not including these variables was the different methodol-
ogies to assess these constructs used across studies, which
makes it difficult to standardize results. Fourth, a great
variety of personal strategies for attempting to control
weight were assessed in a relatively small number of studies,
which makes it difficult to determine the exact prevalence of
usage of each method. This makes results for weight loss
strategies less robust that what is desirable, which should
be seen as an important limitation. A systematic standard-
ized approach in this regard must be taken in future studies
(for example, using validated instruments like the OxFAB
taxonomy (13), which we have used to synthesize results).
Finally, weight control motives, which are particularly
susceptible
to
social
desirability/undesirability,
were
assessed in only a small number of studies and without a
standardized
instrument,
probably
leading
to
over-/
underestimated results.
Conclusions and implications
In summary, this study indicates that in the general popula-
tion about four in 10 adults have tried to lose weight at
some point in time and also in the last five years. Key
strategies and motives associated with weight control were
identified, presenting a clearer picture of weight manage-
ment from the perspective of those actively seeking it.
Although the majority of individuals used strategies in line
with
recommendations
(social
desirability
notwith-
standing), we could not estimate the psychological, econom-
ical or social impacts that these attempts may involve.
Losing weight often involves substantial investments of
time, energy and expectations, sometimes lasting years or
decades, something which cannot be ignored. Finally, there
seems to be a mismatch between prevalent motives to lose
weight
and
those
which
research
indicates
as
more
conducive to long-term success.
We believe that this detailed picture of weight control
attempts among adults worldwide provides valuable infor-
mation for healthcare professionals and policy makers
towards better planning and resource allocation directly
targeting obesity prevention and treatment. From a societal

management solutions,
it
is
imperative
to
rigorously
evaluate the quality of community, public, and especially
commercial weight management services and products,
which are increasingly available, and to respond to this
demand by funding research for, and promoting evidence-
based and safe services and products targeting long-term
weight control. Additionally, in order to better capture
prevalence shifts, surveillance systems should be scheduled,
