Background. Antibiotics are life-saving drugs but severely affect the gut microbiome with short-term consequences including 
diarrhea and selection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Long-term links to allergy and obesity are also suggested. We devised a product, 
DAV132, and previously showed its ability to deliver a powerful adsorbent, activated charcoal, in the late ileum of human volunteers.
Methods. We performed a randomized controlled trial in 28 human volunteers treated with a 5-day clinical regimen of the 
fluoroquinolone antibiotic moxifloxacin in 2 parallel groups, with or without DAV132 coadministration. Two control goups of 8 
volunteers each receiving DAV132 alone, or a nonactive substitute, were added.
Results. The coadministration of DAV132 decreased free moxifloxacin fecal concentrations by 99%, while plasmatic levels were 
unaffected. Shotgun quantitative metagenomics showed that the richness and composition of the intestinal microbiota were largely 
preserved in subjects co-treated with DAV132 in addition to moxifloxacin. No adverse effect was observed. In addition, DAV132 
efficiently adsorbed a wide range of clinically relevant antibiotics ex vivo.
Conclusions. DAV132 was highly effective to protect the gut microbiome of moxifloxacin-treated healthy volunteers and may 
constitute a clinical breakthrough by preventing adverse health consequences of a wide range of antibiotic treatments.

Antibiotics constitute one of the most medically important and 
effective class of drugs. However, during systemic antibiotic treat-
ments, the nonabsorbed part of orally administered drugs, as well 
as the possible fraction excreted into the upper intestine via bile 
for both oral and parenteral antibiotics, reaches the cecum and 
colon where it can exert devastating effects on the gut microbi-
ome, with short- and long-term consequences [1–5]. Short-term 
effects include diarrhea, Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), and 
selection of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms [6–8]. CDI cur-
rently constitutes a major clinical challenge, and antibiotic treat-
ments are the key factor for their occurrence in hospitalized and 
community patients [9–11]. Long-term links to allergy [4] and 
obesity [5] have also been suggested. Indeed, burgeoning research 
in recent years has shown that the intestinal microbiome plays an 
important role in many aspects of human physiology and health 
[12]. In particular, it is involved in the production of metabolites 
that may affect insulin sensitivity [13] and diet-related obesity 
[14]; this state has been shown to correlate with a gut microbi-
ome of lower bacterial richness than in healthy individuals [15].
Strategies that would preserve the intestinal microbiome from 
deleterious consequences of dysbiosis during antibiotic treat-
ments would be highly welcome for immediate protection of 
patients from CDI, and also for long-term public health conse-
quences such as dissemination of resistant bacteria and the occur-
rence of metabolic disorders. Oral administration of a β-lactamase 
[16–20] prevented the impact of parenteral β-lactams on the 
microbiome, which is promising but limited to this class of anti-
biotics. Delivering a nonspecific adsorbent to the colon partially 
decreased fecal concentrations of orally administered ciprofloxa-
cin without significantly affecting its plasma pharmacokinetics in 
rats [21]. We devised a product, DAV132, which delivers a pow-
erful nonspecific adsorbent, a carefully chosen activated charcoal, 
to the late ileum in humans, and have shown in healthy volunteers 
that its administration did not affect the plasma pharmacokinetics 
of amoxicillin, given as a single dose [22]. Here, we performed a 
randomized clinical trial in volunteers receiving a full oral clinical

course of the fluoroquinolone antibiotic moxifloxacin (MXF), and 
assessed DAV132 safety, as well as its resulting effects on MXF 
plasma concentrations, MXF free fecal concentrations, and intes-
tinal dysbiosis. We also evaluated ex vivo the capacity of DAV132 
to adsorb a wide range of clinically relevant antibiotics.
METHODS
Investigational Products
DAV132 was manufactured according to Da Volterra’s specifi-
cations [22] under Good Manufacturing Practice conditions at 
NextPharma (Bielefeld, Germany). The dosage form, consisting 
of 7.5 g DAV132, contained 5.11 g activated charcoal as active 
adsorbing ingredient. To facilitate oral intake, DAV132 pellets 
were suspended in an extemporaneously prepared gel suspen-
sion (batch number C1311007). A negative control (CTL) was 
made of a product similar to DAV132, in which the adsorb-
ent was replaced by microcrystalline cellulose (batch number 
C1311006). MXF was from Bayer (Avalox 400 mg Filmtabletten, 
batch number BXGFBN1).
Subjects and Clinical Trial Design
Male and female healthy volunteers >18 years old having 
given written informed consent were included (body mass 
index <30 kg/m2, normal digestive transit and healthy (by 
medical history, physical examination, vital signs, electro-
cardiography, and blood laboratory results) at a screening 
visit 8–21 days prior to treatment beginning, defined as day 
1. Subjects carrying C. difficile at screening or with a history of 
hospitalization or antibiotic exposure (both past 3 months) or 
vaccination (past 28 days) were not included.
Volunteers were included as outpatients (March–October 
2014) in a prospective, randomized, controlled, repeated doses, 
open-label trial, blinded to analytical and microbiological 
evaluations, at the Clinical Investigation Centre of the Bichat 
Hospital, Paris (France) in respect with Good Clinical 
Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki as last amended. 
Volunteers were randomized (Supplementary Materials) 
to receive either MXF alone (n = 14), MXF + DAV132 (n 
= 14), DAV132 alone (n = 8), or CTL (n = 8) (Figure 1). 
 
The study was carried out after authorizations from French 
Health Authorities and the Independent Ethics Committee 
(“Comité de Protection des Personnes Ile-de-France IV,” 
Paris, France) had been obtained (January and February 
2014, respectively). It was declared in ClinicalTrials.gov 
(identifier NCT02176005) and the French (ID-RCB number 
2013-A01504-41) registers of clinical trials. A study-specific 
scientific committee (A. A., V. A., A. Duc., A. Duf., X. D., C. F., 
J. G., F. M., and M. V.) was set up to ensure scientific integrity.
Treatments
Moxifloxacin 400 mg was administered orally, once a day (after 
breakfast) from day 1 to day 5 under direct observed therapy. 
DAV132 or CTL, 7.5 g, was administered orally, thrice daily 
(before meals) from day 1 to day 7; on day 1, the first DAV132 
dose was given 2 hours before MXF. Morning administra-
tions of DAV132 and of CTL were performed under direct 
observed therapy, while noon and evening intake were reported 
by the subjects. Compliance was assessed by counting empty 
bottles each following day. Follow-up was until day 37. See 
Supplementary Materials for details on collection and storage 
of fecal and plasma samples.
MXF Assay in Plasma and Fecal Samples
Moxifloxacin assays were performed by Amatsi Group 
(Fontenilles, France) using specifically developed and validated 
bioanalytical methods (Supplementary Materials).

Statistical Methods
The primary objective was to evaluate the influence of DAV132 
on free fecal MXF concentrations between day 1 and day 16 
by comparing individuals in the MXF- and MXF + DAV132–
treated groups. The primary endpoint was the area under the 
time curve from D1 to D16 (AUCD1-D16) of free fecal MXF 
concentrations.
The study sample size was calculated at the time of study de-
sign. Assuming an AUCD1-D16 variability similar to that of the 
AUCD1-D14 previously measured from individual data [23], a 
sample size of 11 subjects in each MXF-treated group (MXF 
and MXF + DAV132) would allow to detect a 2-fold change be-
tween these groups (90% power, 2-sided test, type I error 0.05). 
For security, we included 14 subjects in each of these groups. 
Additionally, we randomized 2 groups of 8 volunteers without 
MXF, but with DAV132 or CTL to study secondary objectives 
(DAV132 safety and intestinal microbiota composition).
As preplanned for the primary objective, comparison of 
log(AUCD1-D16) of free MXF fecal concentrations, in groups treated 
with MXF + DAV132 and MXF alone, was performed using a gen-
eral linear model. AUCD1-D16 were calculated by the trapezoidal 
method using the actual time of stool emission and the results were 
expressed as geometric means of AUCD1-D16 and coefficient of varia-
tion. For MXF plasma concentrations, comparisons of log(AUC0-24h) 
and log(Cmax), in groups treated with MXF + DAV132 and MXF 
alone, were performed using a general linear model. AUC0-24h was 
calculated by the trapezoidal method. Statistical analysis of clinical 
and pharmacokinetic data was performed using SAS version 9.4 
software (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina).
Metagenomic Methods and Analysis
Analysis of metagenomic data was exploratory and not prespe-
cified. Essentially, total fecal DNA was extracted as described 
previously [24, 25] and sequenced using SOLiD 5500 Wildfire 
(Life Technologies) resulting in 67.2 ± 19.8 M (mean ± stan-
dard deviation) sequences of 35-base-long single-end reads. 
High-quality reads were generated with quality score cutoff >20. 
Reads with a positive match with human, plant, cow, or SOLiD 
adapter sequences were removed. Filtered high-quality reads were 
mapped to the MetaHIT 3.9M gene catalog [26] using METEOR 
software [27]. The read alignments were performed in colorspace 
with Bowtie software (version 1.1.0) [28] with options: -v 3 (max-
imum number of mismatches) and -k 10 000 (maximum number 
of alignments per reads). The raw SOLiD read data were deposited 
in the European Bioinformatics Institute European Nucleotide 
Archive under accession number PRJEB12391. Details of read 
mapping, data treatment, and statistical methods to analyze 
microbiome data are provided in the Supplementary Materials.
Adsorption of Antibiotics by Activated Charcoal Ex Vivo
To mimic at best the adsorption of antibiotics onto activated 
charcoal in the gut, we used cecal medium obtained from 
extemporaneously euthanized pigs, stored at –80°C. Antibiotics 
(400 µg/mL), and activated charcoal (4 mg/mL) obtained from 
DAV132 deformulated by incubation for 30 minutes at 37°C 
in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.5 containing 80 nM 
sodium chloride, were independently preincubated with cecal 
medium (1:1 v:v) for 2 hours at 37°C. Then, the 2 preincubation 
reactions were mixed and further incubated for 3 hours at 37°C 
with gentle agitation. For antibiotics sensitive to β-lactamases, 
endogenous enzymes were inactivated by heating at 70°C for 1 
hour. Samples were centrifuged 3 minutes at 19 890g, and non-
adsorbed antibiotics in the supernatant were quantified in trip-
licate using a microbiological assay [29].
RESULTS
Subjects
Overall, 71 subjects were included in the DAV132-CL-1002 
study between 20 March 2014 and 1 September 2014. Twenty-
one subjects did not meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria 
and 5 subjects withdrew consent before randomization. Of 
45 subjects randomized, 1 refused to take treatment and 
withdrew from the study; 44 were treated and completed the 
study: n = 14 in groups MXF and MXF + DAV132, n = 8 in 
groups DAV132 and CTL. All subjects meeting the inclusion/
exclusion criteria, having taken at least 20 doses of DAV132 
(95% of expected doses) and 5 doses of moxifloxacin (100% 
of expected doses) were evaluable and included in the per 
protocol population. There were no deviations from protocol 
during the treatment and follow-up periods. Therefore, the 44 
subjects were included in both per protocol and safety anal-
ysis sets. The number of subjects analyzed in groups MFX 
and MFX + DAV132 ensured a study statistical power >90%; 
the characteristics of volunteers were similar in both groups 
(Supplementary Table 2).
MXF Pharmacokinetics in Feces and Plasma
In volunteers with MXF alone, average fecal concentrations of 
free MXF peaked at 136.2 µg/g (with 39% intersubject coeffi-
cient of variation [CV]) at day 6 and returned to undetectable 
levels by day 16 (Figure 2A); they were markedly reduced in 
volunteers that received MXF together with DAV132, with 
free fecal MXF concentrations ranging from 1 to 14 µg/g feces 
between day 1 and day 6. Indeed, coadministration of DAV132 
reduced the AUCD1-D16 of fecal free MXF by >99%, with geomet-
ric means of 699.2 µg/g/day (CV 41%) in the MXF group vs 6.4 
µg/g/day (CV 69%) in the MXF + DAV132 group (p = 3.10–18). 
Despite the low concentrations of free fecal MXF in volunteers 
that were coadministered DAV132, no selection for resistance 
in coliforms was seen; some quinolone- and fluoroquino-
lone-resistant strains emerged, but no difference was observed 
between the treatment groups (Supplementary Table 1). When 
adjusting for each main individual characteristic of the volun-
teers (Supplementary Table 2) in a multivariate analysis, the

effect of DAV132 on reducing logAUCD1-D16 of free fecal MXF 
concentration remained significant (analysis not shown).
By contrast, plasma concentrations of MXF at day 1 and day 
5 were not significantly different in volunteers who received 
DAV132 or not, in addition to MXF, as shown by analysis of the 
geometric means of the AUC0-24h and Cmax (Figure 2B and 2C 
and Table 1).
The safety analysis showed that repeated oral administration 
of DAV132 during 7 days was safe and well tolerated. Only 1 
adverse effect, a per-treatment vulvovaginal mycotic infection, 
possibly related to MXF, was considered as related to a study 
product by the investigator. No adverse effect considered as 
related to DAV132 was reported. No clinically relevant abnor-
mality in vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiographic parameters 
and laboratory results occurred in any subject during the study.
Prevention of Intestinal Dysbiosis by DAV132
The global effect of DAV132 administration on the gut microbiome 
was explored in 2 ways, by assessing microbiome bacterial gene rich-
ness and overall composition. Richness was strongly decreased to 
54.6% of baseline value at day 6 in volunteers who received MXF 
alone, and failed to return to the initial value even at day 37 (Figure 
3A); this decrease was greatly attenuated by coadministration of 
DAV132 (97.8% of baseline value at day 6, close to what was observed 
for the CTL group). We also assessed the impact of treatments on 
bacterial gene richness over the length of the trial by computing the 
AUC, between day 0 and day 16, of its relative change from day 0 for 
each individual (Figure 4A). This interval was chosen because most 
of richness evolution took place within it, and no residual antibiotic 
was present at D16 (Figure 2A). The AUCD0-D16 of gene richness 
change was significantly different among the 4 groups of volunteers 
(p = 4.10–6) (Figure 4A). It was significantly lower in volunteers 
receiving MXF alone than in those in the CTL group (q = 1.10–5); it 
was significantly higher in those treated with MXF + DAV132 than 
in those receiving MXF alone (q = 4.10–7), and not significantly dif-
ferent from those in the CTL group (q = 0.8), thereby showing the 
protective effect of DAV132 (Figure 4A). Finally, the AUCD0-D16 of 
gene richness change was highly correlated with the AUCD1-D16 of 
free MXF fecal concentrations (Figure 4B), further illustrating the 
impact of MXF on richness.
Overall changes of microbiome composition with time were 
assessed by computing, for each individual, the Spearman rank 
correlation coefficient of the relative abundance of bacterial genes 
between each time point and the screening pretreatment day

(Figure 3B). Microbiome composition changed little over time in 
the CTL and DAV132 groups of volunteers that did not receive 
MXF (Figure 3B). By contrast, exposure to MXF resulted in marked 
microbiome changes, detected from D3, maximal at D6, and still 
partially present 30 days after the treatment ended; these changes 
were greatly attenuated by DAV132 (Figure 3B). The comparison 
of Spearman rank correlation coefficient values at D6 across the 4 
groups was significant (p = 2.10–6). Those values were significantly 
lower in the MXF-treated group (median [min, max] 0.44 [0.34, 
0.59]) than in the CTL group (0.65 [0.60, 0.70], q = 2.10–4) and in 
the MXF + DAV132 group (0.62 [0.53, 0.66], q = 1.10–5). DAV132 
exerted an important, but not total protection of the microbiome 
from the effect of MXF, as the median in the MXF + DAV132 
group was slightly lower than in the CTL group (q = 0.03).
Intestinal Microbiota Analysis at the Species Level
Six hundred twenty-nine of 741 (85%) metagenomic species 
(MGSs; see Supplementary Figure 1 and Supplementary Table 
3) found in the MetaHit gut microbial catalogue of 3.9 M genes 
were present in at least 1 sample. The mode of their AUCD0-D16 
distribution was 0 in the CTL group as well as in volunteers 
treated with DAV132 alone, indicating that the abundance of 
most MGSs did not change (Figure 3C). The distribution of 
AUC values for the MXF group was strikingly different, with 
a broad shoulder toward negative values, indicating a decrease 
in the abundance of numerous MGSs. This shoulder was largely 
absent in the MXF + DAV132 group, suggesting that many 
MGSs were protected by DAV132.
A detailed analysis of the MGSs that differed significantly 
between treatment groups (Supplementary Figure 1 and 
Supplementary Table 3) showed that of the 252 MGSs present 
at baseline in at least 4 volunteers per group, 99 were differen-
tially abundant. Only 3 were affected by DAV132 given alone, 
whereas 86 were affected by the MXF treatment; among them, 
81% were fully protected, and a further 12% partially protected 
from the effect of MXF by coadministration of DAV132.
Taxonomical Analysis
Taxonomical characterization at the genus level (Figure 5) 
showed that Alistipes, Bilophila, Butyciromonas, Coprobacillus, 
Fecalibacterium, Odoribacter, Oscillibacter, Parasutterella, 
Roseburia, and Sutterella genera were decreased in MXF-treated 
volunteers, and partially (Bilophila) or fully (all others) pro-
tected by DAV132. In contrast, Bacteroides, Paraprevotella, and 
Lachnoclostridium were unaffected by MXF as well as MXF + 
DAV132 treatments.
We used a set of 34 MGS characteristic of the high-richness 
microbiome of healthy individuals present among the 252 exam-
ined above (Supplementary Table 4) to assess whether MXF 
may induce not only an overall loss of gut microbiome rich-
ness but also a shift to a composition expected in low-richness

microbiomes. The AUCD0-D16 of log10 of relative abundance 
change from D0 of these 34 MGS was significantly different 
among the 4 groups of volunteers (p < 10–4; Supplementary 
Figure 2), being significantly lower under MXF treatment alone 
than under CTL (q = 1.10–4) or MXF + DAV132 (q = 1.10–4); just 
as for overall gene richness, this measure also showed no signifi-
cant difference between the MXF + DAV132 and CTL groups (q 
= 0.6), further attesting to the protective effect of DAV132.
Ex Vivo Adsorption of Other Antibiotics
To assess whether DAV132 could also protect against antibiot-
ics other than MXF routinely used in the clinic, we examined 
the capacity of the activated charcoal released from DAV132 
to adsorb them under ex vivo conditions, that is, in pig cecal 
medium (Table 2). Among the 14 antibiotics routinely used in 
clinic tested, 13 were adsorbed to an extent of at least 95% by the 
charcoal after 3–5 hours of contact with deformulated DAV132. 
Only amoxicillin was a little less adsorbed, to the extent of 92%.
DISCUSSION
Our most important result was that in human volunteers treated 
with a clinical 5-day course of oral MXF, DAV132 spared the intes-
tinal microbiome from exposure to free MXF by >99%, without 
affecting the plasma pharmacokinetics of the antibiotic or caus-
ing any serious adverse effects. This is a major advance over what 
we showed in the first DAV132 phase 1 trial that was limited to a 
small number of volunteers treated with DAV132 for 24 hours and 
receiving only a single dose of amoxicillin [22]. Here, DAV132 was 
associated with a full 5-day clinical course of a widely used fluo-
roquinolone antibiotic. The facts that all randomized volunteers 
completed the study and that only a small amount of data were 
missing ensure the validity of the results. We conclude that the 
coadministration of DAV132 with MXF is safe, and should not 
affect the systemic therapeutic effects of oral as well as parenteral 
antibiotic treatments. The fact that DAV132 is able to markedly 
reduce fecal MXF concentrations without significantly affecting 
systemic exposure to the antibiotic, contrarily to the use of non-
formulated activated charcoal [30], is due to the targeted delivery 
of the adsorbent component to the ileocecal region [22].
Our second most important result was that coadministration 
of DAV132 largely protected richness and composition of the 
intestinal microbiota of MXF-treated volunteers. The changes 
observed with MXF alone that were maximal after 6 days of 
antibiotic, and persisted a month after the treatment ended, 
were reminiscent of those previously observed with cipro-
floxacin [2]. Under coadministration of DAV132 with MXF, 
they were largely reduced and return to baseline was observed 
11 days after treatment ended, suggesting that long-term con-
sequences of antibiotics might be spared. Indeed, a third of the 
252 MGSs identified in the gut microbiota of the volunteers 
were affected by MXF, but the coadministration of DAV132 
fully protected 81% of the affected MGSs, and a further 12%

11.63 [9.50, 13.24] for MFX, 15.34 [14.10, 16.62] for MXF + DAV132, 15.66 [14.91, 17.28] for DAV132, and 15.59 [14.88, 18.25] for negative control (CTL). Of note, in absence 
of any change from D0 the value of AUCD0-D16 would be 16. Median values, quartiles, and 1.5 interquartile range are shown. The distribution of the AUCD0-D16 of gene richness 
was significantly different between the 4 groups (Kruskal–Wallis test p = 4.10–6). In the pairwise comparisons, it was significantly lower in healthy volunteers (HVs) receiving 
MXF alone than in those receiving MXF + DAV132 (q = 4.10–7) or negative control (q = 1.10–5), whereas the difference between HVs receiving MXF + DAV132 and negative 
control was not significant (q = 0.8) as assessed by the Wilcoxon rank-sum test with Benjamini–Hochberg correction for the 4 pairwise comparisons. No difference was 
observed between the group receiving DAV132 alone and CTL (q = 0.8). The number of individuals in different groups was MXF, n = 14; MXF + DAV132, n = 13; DAV, n = 8; 
CTL, n = 8. B, Relationship between AUCD0-D16 of gene richness change from D0 and AUCD1-D16 MXF fecal concentration (r2 = 0.71, p = 4.10–8). Red and blue dots correspond

partially. Of particular interest in that respect was that the 34 
MGSs that had previously been shown to be associated with the 
high-richness microbiome in healthy individuals [15] were well 
protected.
A third important result from the study was that the adsorb-
ent released from DAV132 could efficiently adsorb, under ex 
vivo conditions mimicking the cecum, antibiotics from several 
distinct and therapeutically important classes such as β-lactams 
of all categories (penicillins, cephalosporins, and carbapenems), 
fluoroquinolones, and lincosamides. This indeed suggests that 
the coadministration of DAV132 could protect the human gut 
microbiome against the deleterious effects of many antibiotics, 
including those administered orally, without affecting their 
plasma pharmacokinetics, as we previously showed with the 
β-lactam amoxicillin [22], and here with the fluoroquinolone 
MXF. The nonspecific nature of the adsorbent used in DAV132 
might indeed be advantageous over the use of the recently pro-
posed β-lactamase for prevention of intestinal dysbiosis and 
C. difficile infections, which is limited to association with par-
enteral treatments by penicillins and cephalosporins [20].
Another set of results in this trial was strongly favorable for 
the possibility to further use DAV132 in the clinic. First, con-
cerning safety, despite the relatively important dose of charcoal 
that was given (7.5 g thrice daily), the treatment was associated 
with no significant side effects, in particular intestinal ones 
except for the black darkening of feces. DAV132 had no impact 
on blood electrolytes or coagulation parameters, suggesting 
that it did not interfere with electrolyte exchanges or vitamin K 
production, both of which take place in the colon. Compliance 
to treatment was not an issue for the volunteers. Second, we 
did not observe any remarkable differential modification in 
the emergence of quinolone/fluoroquinolone-resistant coli-
forms between groups of volunteers, even when the free fecal 
antibiotic concentrations were low as in those who received 
MXF+DAV132. Notwithstanding the small number of sub-
jects, this is reassuring because some have suggested that low

 Microbiome Protection From Antibiotics • JID 2018:217 (15 February) • 635
concentrations of fluoroquinolones might be prone to increase 
the selection of resistant bacteria [31]. The small number of 
subjects and the fact that they were naive volunteers might 
also have prevented the observation of a significant difference 
of emergence of fluoroquinolone-resistant enterobacteria in 
those who received MXF vs CTL, as was observed after cip-
rofloxacin treatment, in 10-fold larger groups of hospitalized 
patients [32].
Despite these positive results, our work has limitations. First, 
in this phase 1 trial we did not address directly the efficacy of 
DAV132 to protect patients against immediate consequences 
of antibiotic treatments such as C. difficile colitis. However, we 
recently published preclinical results in hamsters that suggest 
that such might well be the case [33]. Second we did not address 
the possibility that DAV132 might interfere with other drugs 
that could be taken concomitantly for therapeutic purposes by 
patients treated with antibiotics. This was far beyond the pur-
pose of the current study but will have to be determined before 
testing the product in actual patients.
Whatever these limitations, the results of this phase 1 trial 
appear promising: DAV132 may constitute a breakthrough 
product to prevent short- and long-term detrimental effects of 
antibiotic treatments. Further studies are under way to validate 
the potential of DAV132 in a clinical setting.
