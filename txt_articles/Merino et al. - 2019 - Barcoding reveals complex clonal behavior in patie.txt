Primary triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) are prone to dissemination but sub-clonal
relationships between tumors and resulting metastases are poorly understood. Here we use
cellular barcoding of two treatment-naïve TNBC patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) to track
the spatio-temporal fate of thousands of barcoded clones in primary tumors, and their
metastases. Tumor resection had a major impact on reducing clonal diversity in secondary
sites, indicating that most disseminated tumor cells lacked the capacity to ‘seed’, hence
originated from ‘shedders’ that did not persist. The few clones that continued to grow after
resection i.e. ‘seeders’, did not correlate in frequency with their parental clones in primary
tumors. Cisplatin treatment of one BRCA1-mutated PDX model to non-palpable levels had a
surprisingly minor impact on clonal diversity in the relapsed tumor yet purged 50% of distal
clones. Therefore, clonal features of shedding, seeding and drug resistance are important
factors to consider for the design of therapeutic strategies.

ntratumoral heterogeneity is generated through genetic and
non-genetic processes that result in a single tumor com-
prising diverse subclones, which can evolve along complex
trajectories1,2. The implementation of high-throughput geno-
mic sequencing approaches at the population level, and now
single cell level, has demonstrated extensive molecular hetero-
geneity within solid tumors, including breast cancer3. This
complexity has direct bearing on our understanding of tumor
evolution, metastasis, drug resistance, and the sampling of
lesions from patients to identify the most useful therapeutic
targets. One caveat of the single-cell genomics approach is that,
due to current technical limitations, only a minute fraction of
single cells from a whole tumor and distal sites can be sampled.
Furthermore, genomic alterations are only one source of tumor
heterogeneity,
with
transcriptome,
epigenome
and
post-
translational control mechanisms also recognized as con-
tributing to heterogeneity4,5. Critically, a systematic assessment
of the growth and metastatic characteristics of individual cells
within primary tumors in a patient-derived xenograft (PDX)
setting and peripheral organs, and their response to therapeutic
intervention, is lacking.
Breast cancer mortality is caused by metastasis; a complex
process involving dissemination, deposition, and growth of
tumor cells at distant sites6,7. Triple negative breast cancer
(TNBC), characterized by a lack of expression of HER2 and the
hormone receptors estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PR), has a
propensity to disseminate to visceral organs including the lungs
and liver8,9. Studies on paired patient autopsy samples have
highlighted
heterogeneity
between
primary
tumors
and
metastases9–12. Analyses of primary breast tumors and brain
metastases with their counterpart PDX models has indicated
that metastatic lesions contain de novo mutations not present
in the original tumor, and likely arise from a minor subset of
tumor cells13–15. Clonal tracking studies using PDX tumors16,17
or a mouse mammary tumor cell line18 have revealed diverse
clonal growth patterns amongst transplanted tumors in mice,
while single-cell analysis indicated a stem-cell program linked
to metastatic potential19.
We sought to assess the clonal diversity within human drug-
naïve breast tumors and their resulting metastases, and how this
changed with therapeutic intervention. Open questions inclu-
ded: what fraction of clones can disseminate; how reflective are
these of the primary tumor; which clones contribute to meta-
static disease in different organs; and what is the consequence of
therapy to clonal diversity? To this end we utilized breast PDXs,
which largely retain the original patient tumor heterogeneity
and exhibit reproducible kinetics during secondary xenograft-
ing13–15,20,21. Moreover, these models enable studies on the
behavior of human ‘drug-naïve’ tumors in a physiological and
therapeutic context, in contrast to specimen analysis at autopsy,
and are thus considered ‘pseudo-primary’ tumor models. Rather
than assess a subset of sampled cells, e.g. through single cell
genomic means, we sought to capture the majority of tumor
biomass and tumor cells at distal sites, and examine their het-
erogeneity in an unbiased fashion. Distal sites include cells that
have shed from the primary tumor and are found in the blood
stream as circulating tumor cells (CTCs), or in other distal
organs (e.g. lung, bone marrow, ovaries, and kidney) where they
accumulate as disseminated tumor cells (DTCs). We therefore
utilized cellular barcoding, which allows robust assessment of
clonal diversity and numbers at high resolution and depth,
including confident detection of small clones of, e.g. 5–10 cells
amongst millions22. Our findings provide insights into the
spatio-temporal diversity of clones in metastatic disease, and in
response to therapy, with implications for the diagnosis, mon-
itoring, and treatment of patients.
Results
Engraftment and clonal growth of transplanted barcoded
PDXs. We examined 15 TNBC PDXs and found through detailed
analyses of multiple organs that three gave rise to macroscopic
metastases. These three TNBC tumor models, PDX-110 (BRCA1-
mutated), PDX-322, and PDX-744 were derived from samples
taken at the time of surgery from drug-naïve patients. All three
tumors were transplanted and gave rise to primary tumors and
metastases (Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Figure 1A
and B) and were intermediate in their growth kinetics amongst
our PDX bank and comparable to those reported by others23. The
clinical, histopathological, and molecular features of these tumors
have been previously described24,25. PDX-110, PDX-322, and
PDX-744 metastasized to multiple sites including lungs and liver
(Supplementary Figure 1B), while PDX-110 also colonized the
brain and PDX-322 seeded lymph nodes and adrenal glands,
mimicking metastatic sites observed in the corresponding patients
(Supplementary Table 1). Metastases were confirmed to be epi-
thelial in origin by immunostaining for keratin expression
(Supplementary Figure 1C).
We next utilized cellular barcoding to gain insight into the
engraftment and growth characteristics of individual cells within
early passage PDX tumors26. Cell suspensions prepared from
tumor xenografts (XP3) were barcode-labeled (Fig. 1a and
Methods), cultured for 48 h, sorted by flow cytometry for barcode
integration (i.e. GFP expression), and then transplanted into the
mammary fat pads of NSG (NOD/SCID/IL2Rγc-/-) immunodefi-
cient mice. Different numbers of barcoded GFP+ cells (between
500 and 10,000) were sorted 2500 cells per mammary fat pad
were chosen for all subsequent experiments to maximize barcode
number given our barcode library size, while avoiding repeat use
of barcodes26. Barcode composition was assessed by PCR and
sequencing from tumors, CTCs, and distal sites of metastasis at
different stages of disease progression (Fig. 1a). These included
early stage disease (T1), tumors at ethical-endpoint (T2), late
metastatic disease after tumor resection (T3), and tumor relapse
after chemotherapy (T4).
Quantification of the number of barcodes in primary tumors at
T1 and T2 demonstrated an engraftment efficiency of ~10% for
PDX-110 and PDX-322, respectively (Fig. 1b), and ~1% for PDX-
744
(Supplementary
Figure
1D).
The
range
of
observed
efficiencies was variable between PDXs, consistent with previous
findings27.
Notably, the average number of barcoded clones remained
unchanged throughout the course of primary tumor growth for
PDX-110 and PDX-322 (Fig. 1b, T1 vs. T2, p-values based on
Welch two sample t-test: 0.17 (PDX-110) and 0.14 (PDX-322)),
indicating negligible clonal extinction occurred once the tumor
was established. A broad clone size distribution was evident for all
tumors (Fig. 1c, d; Supplementary Figure 1E, F), consisting of
both major and minor clonal populations spanning up to a
million-fold difference in frequency, in tumors of up to 10–100
million cells. Notably, the appreciation of this level of diversity
would not be achieveable with current single cell genomic
strategies. Across replicates, a more consistent distribution of
clone sizes was observed for PDX-110 compared to PDX-322 and
to a larger extent, PDX-744 (Fig. 1d; Supplementary Figure 1F,
average inter-animal p-values using two-sample K–S test: 0.55 ±
0.21 (mean ± SD, PDX-110) and 0.15 ± 0.09 (mean ± SD, PDX-
322)). For PDX-744, this partly reflected the small number of
clones that engrafted (Supplementary Figure 1E).
Due to the low degree of engrafted clones in PDX-744, we
focused on PDX-110 and PDX-322 for our longitudinal analysis
of metastatic properties. Overall, the broad distribution in clone
sizes amongst the different PDXs indicates that clones differ
greatly in their relative expansion from single cells, likely

 reflecting non-mutually exclusive factors including the molecular
nature of individual clones, stochastic effects, and/or the influence
of the microenvironment.
We assessed the genomic heterogeneity of PDX-110 and PDX-
322 in early passage xenografts after their establishment and
observed substantial genetic alterations (Supplementary Figure 2).
Analysis of copy number based on scRNA-seq data from
9939 sorted tumor cells for PDX-110 and 14,463 tumor cells
for PDX-322 using inferCNV28 revealed shared sub-clonal, large-
scale copy number gains, and losses across the genome in both
PDX models. While not able to directly link barcoded clones with
genomic and transcriptional clonal heterogeneity, this analysis
excludes the possibility that the observed heterogeneity was solely
due to random sampling or clonal drift of cells derived from a
genetically homogeneous PDX.
Clonal mosaicism of primary tumors. Tissue sampling, or
biopsy, is a common diagnostic procedure, but the extent to
which a small fragment reflects the composition of the entire
tumor is an open question. To address the clonal and spatial
heterogeneity within PDX-110 and PDX-322, barcoded tumors
were collected at T2 and dissected into pieces of similar size (2–15
pieces of around ~75 mm3, depending on tumor size) (Fig. 2a, b,
representative example). The number and frequency of barcodes
of the entire organ or tumor biomass were determined by
sequencing (Fig. 2c–f, representative example) exhibiting robust,
sensitive, and representative (i.e. non-random) detection (Sup-
plementary Figure 1H). Each piece of primary tumor contained a
unique profile of barcodes, both in their composition and relative
abundance. This was visualized in two ways and illustrated by two
representative examples for PDX-110 and PDX-322. First, using
‘bubble plots’, where barcodes were distributed along the y-axis,
assigned a unique color, and their bubble size scaled according to
clonal abundance (Fig. 2c, d). This allowed ease of comparison
along the x-axis of a given barcode clone across multiple tumor
pieces, within one mouse. Second, heatmaps allowed full appre-
ciation of the number of clones, and allowed hierachical clus-
tering between tumor pieces (Fig. 2e, f). Combined, we observed
that adjacent pieces typically shared some barcodes, while other
barcodes were distributed throughout the tumor. Using a force-
directed graph based on Hellinger distance (Fig. 2g, h), we spa-
tially reconstructed the tumor pieces in two dimensions, which
largely aligned with the known positional relationships of tumor
pieces in Fig. 2a, b. Thus, barcode diversity and composition were
heterogeneous, and fit with a model in which cells grow in spatial
‘patches’ in PDXs, recapitulating clonal heterogeneity in patient
tumors29–33.
As a general trend, the number of pieces in which a barcode
was detected increased with its biomass in the total tumor
(Fig. 2i). As the exception to the rule, however, we also noted
some small clones (<0.1% of tumor biomass) were highly
dispersed throughout the tumor, whereas some large clones
(>1%) were localized to one or a few pieces (Fig. 2i). By pooling
over multiple mice and measuring this ‘dispersion’, defined as the
number of pieces a barcode was detected scaled by the total
number of pieces per tumor, confirmed a consistent positive
correlation of clone size with dispersion (Fig. 2j, Supplementary
Figure 1G). To better visualize the spatial heterogeneity that may
underlie the patterns that we observe in Fig. 2c, d, we minimally
adapted a modeling framework of 3D cancer growth34 to include
barcoding (Fig. 2k), and the virtual cutting of this model closely
mimicked our data (Fig. 2l).
Through whole tumor assessment performed here, our results
suggest that tumor biopsies are unlikely to capture the full clonal

agreement with previous studies using intravital imaging35,36
and genomic sequencing29–33.
Clonal relationships between primary tumors, CTCs, and
DTCs. A central clinical question is the utility of CTCs as liquid
biopsies37,38. For this to be informative of the composition of
primary tumor, the majority of subclones within a tumor must
have the ability to shed progeny into circulation and must persist
sufficiently long in the bloodstream. Clones could conceivably
differ in respect to these processes, including their propensity to
shed, their rate of shedding, and time prior to clearance, such that
the frequency of CTCs may differ in their representation of the
primary tumor. To address how representative CTCs and lung
DTCs were of the primary tumor at a clonal level, we utilized our
models to compare these tissues at T2, where tumors were at
maximum ethical size in order to track putative shedding clones
detectable in distal organs (Fig. 1a).
For analysis of cells at distal sites, we focused on PDX-110 and
PDX-322 due to their greater clonal diversity. The numbers of
CTCs and lung DTCs were ~105-fold lower compared to the
primary tumor (Fig. 3a). Despite this large difference in total cell
number, the reduction in clone number compared to primary
tumor was, although significant (Welch two-sample t-test),
relatively marginal (e.g. 2.3-fold (PDX-110) and 3.5-fold (PDX-
322) reduction between tumor and lung) for PDX-110 and PDX-
322 (Fig. 3b). As a measure of how reflective CTCs and lung
DTCs were of the primary tumor, we determined the proportion
of their parental barcoded clones in the primary tumor biomass
(see Methods). We established that parental clones of those
detected in CTCs contributed to 80% of biomass in PDX-110
tumors, suggesting that most of these represented larger clones.
For PDX-322, however, there was a broad range from 5% to 90%
in different mice (Fig. 3c).
Many clones were detected only in the tumor: on average,
50% of clones for PDX-110 and 70% for PDX-322, which
was significantly different, presumably through differential
rates in either shedding and/or clearance. Clones could also be
detected in lung and/or blood at the time of harvest (Fig. 3d).
This implied that a significant proportion of clones shed

 blood volumes are too small, but those barcodes that remain in
the smallest sample we tested (80 µl) still represented 50% of
tumor biomass. How this relates to a patient setting and CTC
assays where a much smaller relative amount of blood is drawn
(10 ml out of 5 l) is a highly relevant question. The answer will be
highly dependent on the total number of CTCs, the way in which
the cells are isolated and their clonal diversity in each patient.
Overall, these findings are important as they highlight that CTCs
are likely to be unpredictable in the degree to which they
represent clones that comprise the majority of primary tumor,
with potential implications for the use of CTCs in diagnosis. With
our methodology, we could not determine whether this represents
a differential ability to shed, to be cleared by the host, and/or die
when outside the tumor environment.
Hypothetically, if all clones had an equal ability to shed, then
their chance of detection would be proportional to (i) their clone
size in the primary tumor and (ii) the sensitivity of detecting
limited number of cells in blood and lung. To test this, we
performed in silico subsampling using the number of cells
originally sorted from blood and lung (Fig. 3b, c) and based on
the barcode distribution measured in the tumor. We found that
the number of clones and biomass representated in primary
tumor in the sampled and experimental data was comparable for
both PDX models (Fig. 3b, c, triangles), with the exception of
CTC, for which the biomass was significantly lower than expected
from the above hypothesis (p-values: 0.008 for PDX-110 and
0.00018 for PDX-322 using Welch two-sample t-test).
We then determined which barcodes were detected in tumor,
and/or lung, and/or blood to compare the relative frequencies and
correlations. While barcoded clones differed in their relative
frequency within an organ, they generally correlated in frequency
between organs (Fig. 3e–g). Correlation between CTCs and lung
was significantly higher than the correlation between CTCs and
tumor, or lung and tumor (Fig. 3g), in line with CTCs being
trapped in the highly vascularized lung. Compared to in silico
subsampling, however, the correlation was less than expected
(Supplementary Figure 3E), and particularly reduced for PDX-
322 (Fig. 3f, g), indicating that our null hypothesis of direct
proportional sampling is likely to be over simplified. In summary,
large clones in primary tumors gave rise to higher numbers of
detectable cells in peripheral organs, although some clones were
over-represented and under-represented. Clones detected in lung
did statistically contribute more (in average ~9-fold (PDX-110)
and 5-fold (PDX-322)) to tumor biomass (Wilcoxon rank sum
test with continuity correction, p-value: <2.2−16), regardless of
their dispersion (Fig. 3h).
Distinction between shedders and seeders. In order to model
advanced metastatic disease, primary tumors were resected (once
they reached 150 mm3), and mice euthanized after they developed
symptomatic metastatic disease (~1–2 months post-resection at
T3) from pre-existing metastatic tumor cells (Fig. 1a). Surpris-
ingly, we found that the correlation of barcode frequency between
lungs and primary tumors was significantly reduced in both
PDX-110 and PDX-322 (Fig. 4a–c). There were two main aspects
to these findings: firstly, we identified a large drop in barcode
numbers between the time of resection (T1) and late metastatic
disease (T3) (Fig. 4d). This indicated that many clones in primary
tumors were able to disseminate progeny into blood and lung
(‘shedders’), but more than half extinguished at distal sites once
primary tumor was removed. This could be explained if these
clones were merely ‘shedding’ cells into different organs (at a rate
proportional to their size in tumor), while lacking the ability to
grow. On the other hand, those that survive and grow (i.e. ‘see-
ders’) established stable metastases outside the primary tumor,
and this could have occurred either prior or post resection. Sec-
ondly, there was a larger disparity (i.e. loss of correlation) in
frequency between primary tumor at T1 and lung at T3. Rela-
tively minor clones in primary tumor contributed to most of
metastatic burden, while major clones disappeared or diminished
significantly (Fig. 4a, b, e). When barcode frequency was com-
pared as a fold change (Fig. 4f), the number of clones that differed
from their expected frequency (i.e. the frequency in primary
tumor) by more than 10-fold almost doubled in proportion.
Taken together, our results indicate that clone size in primary
tumor at the time of resection (T1) is neither predictive for the
presence or absence of clones in lung at late metastatic disease,
nor predictive of the metastatic contribution of these clones to
lung.
Seeder clones are a smaller subset of shedding clones. Whether
the capacity to ‘seed’ is related to the environment of the distal
site, or an intrinsic property of the clone is not thoroughly
understood. If the capacity to metastasize were an intrinsic
property of a clone, not excluding any niche-specific factors, then
one might expect their detection in multiple organs. Indeed, we
found that several barcoded clones in both models could be
detected in three or more organs, whereas other clones were only
present in one (Fig. 5a, b; Supplementary Figure 4). Overall,
relatively few clones were able to stably metastasize relative to the
number detected in primary tumor and, as observed earlier
(Fig. 4), their prevalence did not correlate with clone size in the
primary tumor. Further studies will be needed to address the
mechanisms underlying these observations.
Impact of chemotherapy on clonal diversity. Given that het-
erogeneity represents an important obstacle for patient therapy,
we next determined the impact of chemotherapy on tumor het-
erogeneity, and the clonal repertoire associated with local and

 distal relapse of disease. Our hypothesis was that tumor relapse
following a near complete pathological response, in which tumors
shrunk to non-palpable levels, would select for a small number of
refractory clones. We selected PDX-110 (BRCA1-mutated; Sup-
plementary Table 1) to examine the impact of chemotherapy on
tumor heterogeneity, as this PDX was highly responsive to cis-
platin therapy. PDX-322 did not respond well to cisplatin nor a
range of alternative agents tested (e.g. taxane) (data not shown).
As tumors never reached non-palpable levels, this model was not
suitable for testing our hypothesis.
When the primary tumors reached 150 mm3, barcoded PDX-
110 was treated with cisplatin (Fig. 1a), which is commonly used
for the treatment of BRCA1-associated TNBC. Despite a
profound reduction in primary tumor biomass after one or two
cycles (Fig. 6a) of treatment to non-palpable levels, tumors
relapsed at both local and distal sites. Surprisingly, on comparison
with vehicle, we observed only a slight decrease in the number of
barcoded clones that constituted the bulk of relapsed tumor
biomass (not significant) (Fig. 6b, pooled over several mice,
Fig. 6c, Supplementary Figure 5). Rather than selecting for a few
refractory clones, the majority of barcoded clones (~80%)
survived cisplatin treatment and regrew in primary tumor, with
50% remaining detectable in the periphery (Fig. 6c). This rejected
our hypothesis and was non-intuitive considering tumor biomass
depleted rapidly within ~20 days, with a 25–30 days delay before
tumors relapsed. It indicates that ~80% of drug-naïve barcoded
clones, large or small, can harbor at least one cell that was
refractory to two doses of cisplatin.
Three months post-chemotherapy with two cycles of cisplatin
(T4), we used two measures to assess changes in clonal diversity;
Shannon diversity and the Simpson index. In both cases, the
parameters did not change significantly for relapsed tumors, and
only slightly changed for CTCs and lung (significant for CTCs)
(Fig. 6d, e). However, the clones found in lungs and CTCs still
correlated with each other in terms of frequency and with the
primary tumor (Fig. 6f, g). Collectively, these data show that
chemotherapy had a remarkably minor effect on the extinction of
barcoded clones within PDX-110 primary tumors, despite a more
profound effect on the number of barcodes detected in the
periphery.
Discussion
Here we combined cellular barcoding with PDX models for high-
resolution clonal assessment of metastatic drug-naïve TNBC,
both longitudinally, under different conditions, and across mul-
tiple tissue sites. Such a holistic assessment of the contribution of
single barcoded cells to PDX tumors and metastases across all
sampled tissues could not be easily achieved through either (i)

cannot disentangle bona fide minor clones of similar frequency or
(ii) assessment of individual tumor cells from treated patients at
autopsy40, which have already undergone clonal evolution and
would potentially require assessment of millions of single cells for
a comprehensive analysis. Moreover, the use of PDXs allowed
comparison of metastatic disease in different temporal, spatial
and treatment scenarios and in a drug-naïve context. Rather than
analysis of genomic heterogeneity in tumors, for which there is a
large body of accumulating data, we focused on a functional read-
out of barcoded clones that revealed their complex clonal beha-
vior across time, space, and in response to treatment.
We demonstrate inter-tumoral and intra-tumoral hetero-
geneity that includes unique features of barcoded clones to dif-
ferentially (a) grow in primary tumors, (b) ‘shed’ into circulation,

 the primary tumor, and (d) contribute to relapse after che-
motherapy. Importantly, our findings indicate that while CTCs
can be reflective of the bulk of primary tumor biomass, most are
shedders that can be sustained by continuous supply from the
primary tumor but do not seed to generate metastases. This
finding is consistent with previous genomic studies that have
elegantly shown that early DTCs are more heterogeneous than
larger metastatic lesions7,41, due to the selection of the ‘fittest’
clones. As a result, the diagnostic utility of CTCs to predict
metastatic disease may be limited. Moreover, PDXs themselves
can differ widely: particularly low engraftment was observed for
PDX-744, while PDX-322 and PDX-110 were very heterogeneous
in terms of their properties of clone size, shedding, seeding, and
the relative clonal frequency between metastases and distal sites,
even between mice.
Another important feature we observed was the multi-organ
metastatic capacity of very few clones, providing a framework to
now test whether this is related to an intrinsic molecular property
of rare clones for multi-organ metastatic capability (<10%).
Therefore, we promulgate the importance of stratifying clones
functionally into shedders and seeders to conceptualize the
biology underlying metastatic cancer. The molecular or stochastic
etiology of these mechanisms, e.g. whether clone size is an
intrinsic property of barcoded single cells or results from sto-
chastic clonal drift remains to determined. While this study has
focussed on the importance of relating barcoded clone relation-
ships between the primary tumor and the periphery, it also cre-
ates a framework for future work on the tracking of clonal
features.
Interestingly, most clones (~80%) survived chemotherapy in a
PDX model that showed a significant tumor remission then
relapse. This is in contrast to previous findings for a variety of
cancers1,16,42,43 and cell lines44,45 treated with chemotherapy,
where most clones were extinguished, and after tumor resection
in this study, where the majority of clones at distal sites were
cleared. This could be explained by the higher sensitivity of clone
detection through cellular barcoding compared to previous stu-
dies, but further investigations are needed. Moreover, testing
other PDXs for their responsiveness to chemotherapy will be
required to understand whether this is a generalizable feature.
These findings in this PDX model can be explained if at least one
cell in ~80% all treatment-naïve clones survived chemotherapy.
This could either indicate that those drug-naïve clones were
intrinsically molecularly resistant to chemotherapy compared to
the ~20% of clones or, more likely, that resistance was acquired
stochastically in a fraction of cells from most clones following
chemotherapy, as most recently exemplified in an in vitro study45.
In addition, single cell DNA and RNA sequencing prior and
post neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with TNBC suggested
that two models of clonal evolution may co-exist in chemo-
resistance: adaptive and acquired chemoresistance43. However,
studying thousands of single cells present in biopsies or larger
pieces of tumor at surgery (a minute fraction of all tumor cells)
would largely fail to detect minor clones present in the original or
residual tumor in patients.
Whether these features of clonal cancer biology are consistent
with real patient scenarios, and whether the immune system
(absent in NSG mice) exerts an influence needs to be determined.
Furthermore, in patients, tumors can disseminate early during the
transformation46 and can be subjected to a genomic ‘parallel
progression’ during the course of their disease47. Currently, it is
not clear whether any of these molecular features of heterogeneity
overlap with the properties we describe here for barcoded clones.
The development of new technologies enabling clone tracking,
together with genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenetic analyses,
may provide a more complete picture of the mechanisms

 governing tumor evolution in PDXs and patients in the future.
Cellular barcoding together with the analysis of clonal relation-
ships in metastatic PDXs that reflect patient outcomes paves the
way for incorporating clonal information in potential diagnosis or
treatment strategies for breast cancer.
Methods
PDX establishment. Treatment naïve breast cancer primary tumors were collected
after consentment of the patients through the Royal Melbourne Hospital Tissue
Bank and the Victorian Cancer Biobank with relevant institutional review board
approval. Human ethics were approved by the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute
(WEHI) Human Research Ethics Committee. To first establish a line of PDX
material, prior to barcoding experiments, cohorts of 3-week-old or 4-week-old
female NOD-SCID-IL2Rγc–/– female mice were seeded with single cell suspensions
of early passage human breast tumors (passage 3). To establish and maintain the
PDXs, tumor cells (150,000–250,000) were resuspended in 10 µl transplantation
buffer (50% fetal calf serum, 10% of a 0.04% trypan blue solution and 40% PBS)
and growth-factor-reduced Matrigel (BD Biosciences) in a ratio of 3:1, and injected
into the cleared mammary fat pads of recipient mice. All animals were bred and
maintained according to institutional guidelines and protocols were approved by
the WEHI Animal Ethics Committee.
Cellular barcoding and transplantation. For the cellular barcoding experiments,
material from above tumors were collected and digested in 150 U/ml collagenase
(Sigma) and 50 U/ml hyaluronidase (Sigma) for 1 or 2 h at 37 °C. The suspension
was then digested with 0.25% trypsin 1 mM EGTA and 5 mg/ml dispase (Roche
Diagnostics) for 1 min at 37 °C and filtered (40 µm). Red blood cells were removed
by lysis. Cells were then plated in ultralow attachment plates (Corning) in serum-
free mammosphere media containing DMEMF12 with Glutamax (Gibco) supple-
mented with B27 (Invitrogen), 20 ng/ml EGF (BD Biosciences) and 20 ng/ml bFGF
(BD Biosciences), 4 μg/ml heparin (Sigma), 1 µg/ml of Hydrocortisone (Sigma),
5 µg/ml of insulin, and Penicillin–Streptomycin (Gibco). Cells were infected with
the barcoded lentivirus library22, which contains ~2500 98-bp semi-random DNA
barcodes and a GFP reporter. Virus concentration was pre-determined to achieve
10–20% GFP+ in PDX cells for 48 h following a 1.5 h spin transduction, which was
consistent for PDX-110, PDX-322, and PDX-744. Over 10 transduction batches,
the proportion of GFP+ cells was 7 ± 4.99% for PDX-110, 12.18 ± 8.13% for PDX-
322, and 20.35 ± 7.71% for PDX-744 (mean ± SD). Other studies have previously
demonstrated that transduction in the order of 10–20% results in 90–95% of GFP+
cells carry a single barcode according to Poisson statistics26. To determine the
upper bound of multiple integrations, we performed PCR on single cells from a
transduction at the higher end (~20% transduction), and found that ~90% of
193 single cells contained a single barcode, which is in line with the expectation
through Poisson statistics of 20% transduction. After 48 h, cells were washed and
GFP+ cells sorted by flow cytometry and injected into a cohort of 3–4-week-old
NOD-SCID-IL2Rγc–/– female mice. For each mouse, 2500 barcoded cells were
resuspended in 10 µl transplantation buffer and growth-factor-reduced Matrigel
(BD Biosciences) in a ratio of 3:1 and injected into the cleared mammary fat pad.
Mice were sacrificed at different times (see Fig. 1a), or if their health deteriorated
for reasons other than disease progression.
Tumor and mouse monitoring. Tumor volume was estimated three times weekly
using electronic vernier calipers and the formula: (minimum diameter)2(maximum
diameter)/2. Randomization and tumor measurements were managed using the
Study Director software (v 3.0, studylog). Mice were sacrificed when primary
tumors reached 150 mm3 (T1), at the first measurement where tumor volume
exceeded 600 mm3 (T2 and T4), or if their health deteriorated due to metastatic
disease (T3) or for reasons other than disease progression.
Tumor resection or cisplatin treatment. Once tumors reached a volume of
150 mm3, mice were randomized into surgery and treatment arms. Resection was
performed and the tumor was cut into pieces and analyzed as described below. In the
absence of local relapse, the organs were collected when the mice succumbed to
metastatic disease. For the treatment experiments, mice were treated with one or two
cycles of cisplatin (at day 0 and 21; 6 mg/kg) or vehicle (at least 10 mice per arm) and
mice were monitored twice per week, until their primary tumors reached ethical
endpoint. Tumors, blood, and lungs were collected and barcoded cells (GFP+) were
sorted prior to analysis. Other organs were fixed in formalin. Cell numbers in
primary tumor were estimated assuming 106 cells per mg of tumor weight.
Organ collection, cell suspension, and FACS-sorting. Blood was collected by
terminal end bleed (~800 μl) and the red blood cells were lysed before sorting
GFP+. Cell suspensions from lungs were prepared by digestion for 1 h at 37 °C with
2 mg/ml of collagenase (Worthington) and 200 U/ml of deoxyribonuclease
(Worthington) in 0.2% of D-glucose (Sigma) in DPBS (Gibco). The suspension was
then filtrated through a 100 μM cell stainer before red blood cell lysis. Brain pieces
were lysed in Viagen buffer (Viagen DirectPCR® with 1:50 Proteinase K 20 mg/ml
(Invitrogen) or cell suspensions were obtained by mincing and dissociation of the
pieces using collagenase and hyaluronidase digestion for 1 h at 37 °C. Ovaries were
analyzed by direct lysis in buffer or mechanical processing and enzymatic pro-
cessing (collagenase/hyaluronidase digestion for 1–2 h). After red blood cell lysis,
GFP+ cells were sorted. Bone marrow from flushed femurs was lysed in Viagen
buffer. Macrodissected metastases from different organs (liver, uterus, kidney,
lymph nodes) were directly lysed in Viagen buffer. For scRNA-seq analysis, after
single cell preparation as described48, Lin–EpCAM+ tumor cells were isolated by
flow cytometry on the AriaC using anti-CD31 (PE; BD Pharmingen), anti-CD45
(PE; BD Pharmingen), anti-CD235a (PE; BD Pharmingen), anti-EpCAM (CD326;
FITC; Stem Cell Technologies), anti-integrin α6 (APC-Cy7; Biolegend), and 7-
AAD (live/dead separation).
Lysis, PCR amplification of the barcodes and sequencing. Pieces of primary
tumors or metastases were resuspended in Viagen buffer containing 400 μg/ml
proteinase K, before incubation for 1 h at 55 °C and then 30 min at 85 °C. Cell
pellets of sorted cells were resuspended in PCR lysis buffer (Viagen) containing
200 mg/ml proteinase K and dispensed into individual wells of a 96-well plate.
Plates were covered with a rubber mat and lysed in a thermocycler at 55 °C for 1 h,
and then at 85 °C for 30 min to inactivate proteinase K. Samples were only stored at
–20 °C after this step. For the first round of PCR, 160 µl of PCR reagents containing
TopLib 59-TGCTGCCGTCAACTAGAACA-39 and BotLib primers 59-
GATCTCGAATCAGGCGCTTA-39 were added to a 40-µl lysate of all samples.
After mixing, 100 µl was transferred to an adjacent empty well before PCR, to
provide the technical replicates to assess barcode detection reliability (Supple-
mentary Figure 1H for an example). Plates were sealed and placed in a thermo-
cycler at 94 °C for 5 min, then cycled 30 times at 57.2 °C for 15 s, at 72 °C for 15 s
and at 94 °C for 15 s, and then at 72 °C for 10 min. The presence of a 150-bp
product was checked for every sample using 2% agarose gel electrophoresis.
In the second round of PCR, a different index primer was used for every sample
and technical replicate. To do this, a library of 384 different 82-bp index primers
containing unique 8-bp indexes were used (sequences available on request). A
mastermix of PCR reagents (24 µl), included a common reverse primer 59-
CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGATTGCTGCCGTCAACTAGAACA-39.
Subsequently, 5 μl of up to 384 samples after second round PCR containing
different index primers were pooled, and used for cluster generation and
sequencing on a Next-seq (Illumina).
Immunohistochemistry. Tumor and metastatic samples were fixed in 4% paraf-
ormaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. Antigen retrieval was performed using
pH9 antigen retrieval buffer (DAKO S2375) at 95 °C for 20 min or citrate buffer
pH6 at 95 °C for 20 min for CC3. Antibodies against ER (NCL-L-ER-6F11,
Novocastra), PR (NCL-L-PGR-312, Novocastra), HER2 (SP3, Spring Bioscience),
or pan-cytokeratin (DAKO, Clone AE1/AE3) were used at 4 °C overnight, followed
by biotinylated anti-IgG secondary antibodies (Vector Labs). The signal was
detected by incubation with ABC Elite (Vector Labs) for 30 min and 3,3′-diami-
nobenzidine (Dako) for 5 min at room temperature.
scRNA-seq and copy number analyses. Cell suspensions were prepared as
described above for PDX-110 and PDX-322 samples. A 10X Genomics Chromium
machine was used to capture 10,000–15,000 single-cells from each tumor into Gel
Bead-In-EMulsions (GEMs) and cDNA prepared according to the Single Cell 3′
protocol recommended by the manufacturer and previously described49. The final
sequencing library contained standard Illumina paired-end constructs flanked by
P5 and P7 and was sequenced on an Illumina Nextseq 500 using run parameters
described in Single Cell 3′ protocol. Cell Ranger v2.0.0 (10X Genomics) and
bcl2fastq v2.19.1.403 were used to generate genewise sequence read counts for each
cell.
inferCNV (v0.3)28 was used to generate by-cell genome-wide relative copy number
estimates for both the PDX-110 and PDX-322 samples. Genes expressed in fewer than
three cells, and cells expressing fewer than 200 genes, were disregarded and a matrix
of log2(1 + count per 100 kb) was input to inferCNV. Gene coordinates were
determined from gene symbols using a query of Ensembl via BioMart. The inferCNV
script was called with default settings (a cutoff value of 1, a noise filter of 0.2, and
visualization thresholds of ±1).
Cellular barcoding computational analysis. Raw sequencing data was pre-
processed using the R package edgeR50 as previously51. In brief, reads were split
according to sample index, and barcodes associated with each sample were
recorded in a barcode-count matrix. To ensure high quality of the data, samples
with <8000 reads, as well as samples with less than two technical replicates having
over 8000 reads were removed from downstream analysis. To filter out non-specific
PCR amplification, barcodes detected in less than two technical replicates per
samples were discarded. Technical replicates were pooled (except for Supplemen-
tary Figure 1H) by adding the reads in each replicate and barcode, and normalized
to one (i.e. such that the sum over all barcodes per sample equaled one). If technical
replicates from the same sample were processed in different sequencing runs, they
were first normalized, then pooled, and normalized again, to mitigate the effects of
differing sequencing library sizes. Filtered and normalized data was analyzed and

 visualized using the statistical computing language R, specifically the package
ggplot252. For determining significance in the differences of means between two
conditions, the Welch Two Sample t-test was performed on log-transformed
values, and p-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.
Sampling of barcodes from primary tumor was performed with replacement,
with the probability of a given barcode being sampled proportional to its measured
frequency in the primary tumor. The sample size equalled the number of cells
sorted by FACS for a given tissue.
For simulating growth of barcoded tumor cells in three dimensions, the C++
code developed in Waclaw, B. et al.34 was run using the original parameters for
growth and migration, but was adapted to include the additional barcode
information. To mimic our experimental data, simulations were initiated with 200
barcoded tumor-initiating cells, and outcomes were rendered using the PyMol
software. Tumor biomass representation in a distal tissue corresponds to sum of
frequencies in primary tumor of barcoded clones that are shared between primary
and the distal tissue.
