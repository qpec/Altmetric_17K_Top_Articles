Abstract: BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is being increasingly per-
formed in patients with bicuspid aortic valve stenosis (AS). OBJECTIVES: This study sought to compare
the procedural and clinical outcomes in patients with bicuspid versus tricuspid AS from the Bicuspid AS
TAVR multicenter registry. METHODS: Outcomes of 561 patients with bicuspid AS and 4,546 patients
with tricuspid AS were compared after propensity score matching, assembling 546 pairs of patients with
similar baseline characteristics. Procedural and clinical outcomes were recorded according to Valve Aca-
demic Research Consortium-2 criteria. RESULTS: Compared with patients with tricuspid AS, patients
with bicuspid AS had more frequent conversion to surgery (2.0% vs. 0.2%; p = 0.006) and a signifi-
cantly lower device success rate (85.3% vs. 91.4%; p = 0.002). Early-generation devices were implanted
in 320 patients with bicuspid and 321 patients with tricuspid AS, whereas new-generation devices were
implanted in 226 and 225 patients with bicuspid and tricuspid AS, respectively. Within the group re-
ceiving early-generation devices, bicuspid AS had more frequent aortic root injury (4.5% vs. 0.0%; p
= 0.015) when receiving the balloon-expanding device, and moderate-to-severe paravalvular leak (19.4%
vs. 10.5%; p = 0.02) when receiving the self-expanding device. Among patients with new-generation
devices, however, procedural results were comparable across different prostheses. The cumulative all-
cause mortality rates at 2 years were comparable between bicuspid and tricuspid AS (17.2% vs. 19.4%;
p = 0.28). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with tricuspid AS, TAVR in bicuspid AS was associated with a
similar prognosis, but lower device success rate. Procedural differences were observed in patients treated
with the early-generation devices, whereas no differences were observed with the new-generation devices.

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is being increasingly performed in patients with
bicuspid aortic valve stenosis (AS).
OBJECTIVES This study sought to compare the procedural and clinical outcomes in patients with bicuspid versus
tricuspid AS from the Bicuspid AS TAVR multicenter registry.
METHODS Outcomes of 561 patients with bicuspid AS and 4,546 patients with tricuspid AS were compared after
propensity score matching, assembling 546 pairs of patients with similar baseline characteristics. Procedural and clinical
outcomes were recorded according to Valve Academic Research Consortium-2 criteria.
RESULTS Compared with patients with tricuspid AS, patients with bicuspid AS had more frequent conversion to surgery
(2.0% vs. 0.2%; p ¼ 0.006) and a significantly lower device success rate (85.3% vs. 91.4%; p ¼ 0.002). Early-generation
devices were implanted in 320 patients with bicuspid and 321 patients with tricuspid AS, whereas new-generation devices
were implanted in 226 and 225 patients with bicuspid and tricuspid AS, respectively. Within the group receiving
early-generation devices, bicuspid AS had more frequent aortic root injury (4.5% vs. 0.0%; p ¼ 0.015) when receiving the
balloon-expanding device, and moderate-to-severe paravalvular leak (19.4% vs. 10.5%; p ¼ 0.02) when receiving the
self-expanding device. Among patients with new-generation devices, however, procedural results were comparable across
different prostheses. The cumulative all-cause mortality rates at 2 years were comparable between bicuspid and tricuspid
AS (17.2% vs. 19.4%; p ¼ 0.28).
CONCLUSIONS Compared with tricuspid AS, TAVR in bicuspid AS was associated with a similar prognosis, but lower
device success rate. Procedural differences were observed in patients treated with the early-generation devices,
whereas no differences were observed with the new-generation devices. (J Am Coll Cardiol 2017;69:2579–89) © 2017 The

 T
ranscatheter
aortic
valve
replace-
ment (TAVR) has evolved from a
novel technology to an established
therapy for high-risk patients with symptom-
atic
severe
aortic
valve
stenosis
(AS).
Numerous studies have demonstrated the
safety and efficacy of TAVR, and more than
250,000 patients have been treated with
this technology (1–6). Although randomized trials
have established TAVR as the standard treatment in
inoperable patients and a reasonable option in high
surgical-risk patients, these trials excluded congen-
ital bicuspid AS due to its unique morphological
features (1,2,5–7).
The experience of TAVR in bicuspid AS is limited to
small series (8–12). Based on data from previous reg-
istries, the proportion of patients with bicuspid AS
may reach 2% to 6% (13,14). Previous studies were
limited by the clear baseline differences in age and
comorbidities favoring the bicuspid AS study group

 compared with the tricuspid AS study group. How-
ever, there is a paucity of data comparing the clinical
outcomes of TAVR in bicuspid and tricuspid AS. Given
the increasing frequency of bicuspid AS in younger
patients, coupled with the worldwide shift toward
treating younger and lower surgical-risk patients with
TAVR, the clinical outcomes of TAVR in bicuspid AS
warrant
special
attention
(6,15,16).
Furthermore,
current TAVR practice is largely based on evidence on
TAVR for tricuspid AS, and thus, understanding the
differences in clinical outcomes of TAVR in bicuspid
and tricuspid AS is meaningful. Therefore, we aim to
evaluate the clinical outcomes of TAVR in bicuspid AS
and compare them to tricuspid AS. In addition, the
differences in outcomes between bicuspid versus
tricuspid AS will be analyzed, taking into consider-
ation
the
technological
developments
in
trans-
catheter valves.
METHODS
STUDY
DESIGN
AND
PATIENT
POPULATION. The
Bicuspid AS TAVR registry is an international, multi-
center, observational study that enrolled all consec-
utive patients with bicuspid AS undergoing TAVR.
The registry was initiated in December 2013, and a
total of 33 centers from Europe, North America, and
the Asia-Pacific region contributed to the registry. We
collected data retrospectively for cases performed
before initiation, and prospectively thereafter. All
inconsistencies
were
resolved
directly
with
local
investigators and on-site data monitoring. For the
purpose
of
this
study,
data
for
all
consecutive
patients with tricuspid AS treated with TAVR during
the same period were collected from 12 participating
centers, and procedural and clinical outcomes of pa-
tients with bicuspid and tricuspid AS were compared.
As a secondary analysis, the outcomes of TAVR in
bicuspid AS were compared with those with tricuspid
AS according to device type. This study was approved
by the institutional review board of each institution,
and all patients provided written informed consent
for TAVR and the use of anonymous clinical, proce-
dural, and follow-up data for research. For a retro-
spective
analysis
of
clinically
acquired
and
anonymized data, the institutional review boards of
some institutions waived the need for written patient
informed consent.
BICUSPID
AORTIC
VALVE. Bicuspid
aortic
valve
morphology was classified as previously described
by
Sievers
and
Schmidtke
(15)
according
to
the
number of cusps and the presence of raphes, as well
as spatial position and symmetry of raphes and
cusps.
Type
0
was
assigned
to
morphologies
characterized by the presence of 2 symmetric cusps
and 1 commissure without evidence of a raphe. Type
1 was assigned to valve morphologies with 1 raphe,
and type 2 when 2 raphes were present. All partici-
pating centers reviewed and subsequently confirmed
the diagnosis and classification of bicuspid AS. When
both
transesophageal
echocardiography
and
pre-
procedural computed tomography were performed,
patients were excluded if the diagnosis of bicuspid
aortic
valve
was
not
consistent
or
remained
speculative.
STUDY DEVICES AND PROCEDURE. Patients were
selected for TAVR at the institutional level after
discussions by the multidisciplinary heart team. The
access site was determined by the multidisciplinary
heart team. All centers adopted a transfemoral-first
approach policy, with criteria for performing a non-
transfemoral approach based on the heart team’s
consideration of the size, calcification, and atheroma
of the aorto-iliofemoral artery. Device sizes were
selected based on 3-dimensional, multidetector-row
computed tomography–based annular measurements
or transesophageal echocardiogram assessment. All
TAVR procedures were conducted in accordance with
local guidelines using standard techniques via trans-
femoral, transapical, trans-subclavian, or transaortic
access, and the early-generation devices (the Sapien
XT [Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, California] and
CoreValve [Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minnesota]) or
new-generation
devices
(the
Sapien
3
[Edwards
Lifesciences],
Lotus
[Boston
Scientific,
Natick,
Massachusetts]
and
Evolut
R
[Medtronic])
were
implanted (17–22).
ENDPOINTS AND DEFINITIONS. The primary endpoint of
the present study was all-cause mortality at 1 and
2 years. Secondary endpoints were 30-day major clin-
ical endpoints using the Valve Academic Research
Consortium (VARC)-2 criteria (23). Device success was
defined as a composite endpoint including: 1) absence
of procedure-related death; 2) correct positioning
of a single prosthetic heart valve into the proper
anatomic location; and 3) intended performance of
the
prosthetic
heart
valve
(no
prosthesis–patient
mismatch, mean aortic gradient <20 mm Hg or
peak velocity <3 m/s, and no moderate or severe
paravalvular leak). Other endpoints included new
permanent
pacemaker
insertion,
procedure-
and
device-related complications, and echocardiographic
assessment of the valve and cardiac function at
discharge.
No
echocardiographic
core
laboratory
was
used,
and
all
echocardiographic
data
were
site-reported.
The
severity
of
regurgitation
was
qualitatively
assessed
and
graded
using

 transthoracic echocardiography at each institution,
according to established guidelines (23).
DATA COLLECTION. Data collection by a dedicated
case report form included baseline clinical, labora-
tory, echocardiographic, and computed tomographic
data, as well as procedural data and clinical follow-up
data at pre-specified time points (1, 6, and 12 months,
and yearly thereafter). Follow-up was obtained by
clinical visits and/or through telephone contacts.
Referring cardiologists, general practitioners, and
patients
were
contacted
whenever
necessary
for
further information. All data provided by each insti-
tution were anonymized, centrally collected, and
assessed for quality.
STATISTICAL
ANALYSIS. Given the differences in
baseline clinical, echocardiographic, and procedural
characteristics between patients with bicuspid and
tricuspid AS, propensity score matching was applied
to identify a cohort of patients with similar baseline
characteristics, and thus, clinical outcomes of pro-
pensity score–matched cohorts were compared. The
propensity score is a conditional probability of having
a particular exposure (bicuspid AS or tricuspid AS),
given a set of covariates measured at baseline. The
propensity score has been developed using a logistic
regression model according to a nonparsimonious
approach,
and
all
clinical
variables
(age,
sex,
New York Heart Association functional class III or IV,
hypertension, diabetes mellitus, creatinine, periph-
eral vascular disease, prior cerebrovascular accident,
chronic lung disease, prior percutaneous coronary
intervention, prior coronary artery bypass graft, mean
gradient, and left ventricular ejection fraction) as well
as procedural data (transfemoral access and device
type were included in the analysis. Additionally, we
created propensity score–matched cohorts for sub-
groups
(early-
and
new-generation
devices),
and
outcomes were compared. The details of the pro-
pensity score method are described in the Online
Appendix.
After matching, continuous variables following a
normal
distribution
were
compared
using
the
paired-sample Student t test; otherwise, the Wil-
coxon
rank
sum
test
was
used.
Differences
for
matched categorical variables were analyzed with
McNemar’s test. For the VARC-2 major endpoints
and other complications, frequencies and relative
numbers were given including the odds ratio (OR)
with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and p values of

RESULTS
BASELINE
CHARACTERISTICS. A
total
of
576
patients with bicuspid AS were treated with TAVR
across 33 participating centers between April 2005
and May 2016. During the same period, a total of
5,900 patients with tricuspid AS were treated with
TAVR across 12 participating centers. Patients with
missing data or those who received TAVR for degen-
erated bioprostheses were excluded from the anal-
ysis. Consequently, 561 patients with bicuspid AS and
4,546 patients with tricuspid AS were included in the
present analysis (Figure 1). The type of bicuspid AS
was diagnosed in 497 patients (88.6%): type 0 was
diagnosed in 63 patients (12.7%), type 1 in 426
(85.7%), and type 2 in 8 (1.6%).
In the unadjusted cohort, patients with bicuspid
AS
were
younger
and
more
likely
to
be
male,
whereas patients with tricuspid AS were more likely
to have multiple comorbidities (Online Table 1). In
terms of surgical risk, patients with bicuspid AS had
a lower Logistic European System for Cardiac Oper-
ative Risk Evaluation (EuroSCORE) (14.8 � 12.3% vs.
16.7 � 11.8%; p ¼ 0.003) and Society of Thoracic
Surgeons (STS) score (5.0 � 5.1% vs. 6.5 � 8.8%;
p < 0.001). Furthermore, large prostheses were used
more often in the bicuspid AS group (34.5% vs.
14.5%;
p
<
0.001),
whereas
the
transfemoral
approach was equally frequent in both groups. After
performing propensity score matching, both groups
were well matched, with no significant differences in
baseline characteristics, except more frequent use of
the largest prostheses in the bicuspid AS group
(Table 1).
PROCEDURAL AND CLINICAL OUTCOMES. Table 2
summarizes the procedural and clinical outcomes of
the propensity score–matched cohort. Compared with
patients with tricuspid AS, patients with bicuspid AS
had more frequent conversion to surgery, implanta-
tion
of
second
valve,
and
moderate
or
severe
paravalvular leak, as well as a lower device success
rate. There was no significant difference in new
permanent pacemaker insertion between the bicuspid
and tricuspid AS groups.
In
terms
of
30-day
clinical
outcomes,
there
were no significant differences between the bicuspid

Outcomes according to device type. When strati-
fied according to whether they received early- versus
new-generation devices, patients with bicuspid AS
had more frequent procedural complications than
those with tricuspid AS when receiving the early-
generation devices (conversion to surgery: 2.5% vs.
0.3%; p ¼ 0.02; second valve implantation: 7.2% vs.
2.2%; p ¼ 0.003; moderate or severe paravalvular
leak: 15.9% vs. 10.3%; p ¼ 0.03) (Figure 2A). However,
there were no significant differences in procedural
complications between the bicuspid and tricuspid AS
groups when receiving the new-generation devices
(Figure
2B).
These
findings
were
consistently
observed in propensity score matched cohorts for
early- and new-generation devices (Online Figure 1).
Procedural and clinical outcomes according to
device type are shown in Online Figure 2. Compared
with
patients
with
tricuspid
AS,
patients
with
bicuspid AS had more frequent aortic root injury
(4.5% vs. 0.0%; p ¼ 0.015) when receiving the Sapien
XT. In addition, patients with bicuspid AS had more
frequent second valve implantation (11.6% vs. 2.9%;
p ¼ 0.002), moderate or severe paravalvular leak
(19.4% vs. 10.5%; p ¼ 0.02), and subsequent lower
device success rate (72.1% vs. 86.0%; p ¼ 0.002) than
those
with
tricuspid
AS
when
receiving
the
CoreValve. However, there were no significant dif-
ferences in these adverse procedural events between
groups when receiving the Sapien 3 and Lotus.
There were no significant differences in 30-day
mortality
and
other
major
clinical
endpoints
between groups, except that patients with bicuspid
AS had a higher rate of major vascular complications
compared with
patients with tricuspid AS when
receiving the Sapien XT (5.8% vs. 0.7%; p ¼ 0.01)
(Online Figures 3 to 5).
In terms of outcomes across bicuspid phenotype,
there were no significant differences in procedural
and clinical outcomes between type 0 and type 1
bicuspid AS (Online Table 2). Of note, moderate or
severe
paravalvular
leak
occurred
in
5
patients
(8.2%)
for
type
0
bicuspid
AS
and
44
patients
(10.8%) for type 1 bicuspid AS (p ¼ 0.54), whereas all
aortic root injury occurred only in patients with type
1 bicuspid AS.
Midterm mortality. Over a median follow-up period
of 460 days (IQR: 90 to 710 days), 66 patients died in
the bicuspid AS group and 73 patients died in the
tricuspid AS group. There were no differences be-
tween the 2 groups in cumulative event rates for all-
cause mortality at the 2-year follow-up (17.2% vs.
19.4%; p ¼ 0.28) (Central Illustration). Furthermore,
there were no significant differences in 1-year all-
cause mortality rates between groups with stratifica-
tion according to early- and new-generation devices
(early-generation devices: 14.5% vs. 13.7%; log-rank
p ¼ 0.80; new-generation devices: 4.5% vs. 7.4%;
log-rank p ¼ 0.64) (Figures 3A and 3B). These findings
were
consistently
observed
in
propensity
score–
matched cohorts for early- and new-generation de-
vices (Online Figures 6A and 6B).
DISCUSSION
The present study is the first large-scale study to
compare the safety, efficacy, and clinical outcomes of
TAVR in patients with bicuspid and tricuspid AS. The
major findings of the present study are as follows:
1. In the propensity score–matched cohort, TAVR in
patients with bicuspid AS was associated with
more
frequent
adverse
procedural
events
compared with those with tricuspid AS. These dif-
ferences were observed among patients treated
with the early-generation devices.

 2. However, there were no significant differences in
procedural complications between groups when
using the new-generation devices.
3. The cumulative event rates for all-cause mortality
at 2-year follow-up were comparable between the
bicuspid and tricuspid groups.
Recently, 2 multicenter studies demonstrated the
acceptable clinical outcomes of TAVR for bicuspid AS
(8,10). However, patients included in those studies
were younger and had less comorbidities compared
with most published trials and observational studies
including patients with tricuspid AS. Given that
patients
with
bicuspid
AS
have
less
coexisting
comorbidities compared with patients with tricuspid
AS, there is a potential risk that clinical outcomes of
TAVR for bicuspid AS could differ from those for
tricuspid AS with equivalent surgical risk. In the
present study, patients with bicuspid AS in the crude
cohort were younger and had less comorbidity than
those
with
tricuspid
AS.
Both
the
bicuspid
and
tricuspid AS groups had an intermediate-risk profile,
with mean logistic EuroSCOREs of 14.8% and 16.7%,
and mean STS scores of 5.0% and 6.5%, respectively.
In the present study, compared with tricuspid AS,
TAVR in bicuspid AS was associated with similar

 developed to mitigate the critical limitations of the
early-generation
devices:
significant
paravalvular
leak, difficulty with optimal positioning, and vascular
complications. All of these adverse events were re-
ported to be associated with worse outcomes (26–29).
The new-generation balloon-expandable Sapien 3,
with an external sealing cuff allowing for effective
sealing, eliminates the extreme oversizing and miti-
gates the morphological challenges of bicuspid AS.
Similarly, the mechanical expanding Lotus valve,
with an outer adaptive seal, as well as retrievability
and repositioning capacity, may ameliorate the diffi-
culties in optimal positioning and prevent para-
valvular leak. The present study showed that the
initial attempt of device advancement succeeded in
overcoming the procedural limitations in tricuspid
AS, and now goes beyond the challenges of treating
bicuspid AS.
Given that a recent randomized trial demonstrated
similar survival rates between TAVR and surgery in
intermediate-risk patients (6), the extension of TAVR
may be considered for younger and lower-risk pa-
tients
with
a
possibly
increased
proportion
of
bicuspid AS. Despite procedural challenges of TAVR
in bicuspid AS, the present study showed similar
overall mortality rates between the bicuspid and
tricuspid AS groups. This suggests that long-term
mortality of patients with bicuspid AS is determined
by multiple factors that also affect the prognosis of
the tricuspid AS population.
Several essential factors should be considered in
treating patients with bicuspid AS. Sievers et al. (30)
showed a similar late survival and freedom from
reoperation after surgery between the different types
of bicuspid aortic valves. However, given the nature
of transcatheter heart valves, future studies should
evaluate
the
association
between
the
types
of
bicuspid aortic valves and outcomes after TAVR.
Furthermore, management of concomitant aortop-
athy in treating patients with bicuspid aortic valve
should be taken into account. The risk of aortic
rupture or dissection is greater in patients with a
bicuspid aortic valve than in the general population
(31), and also increases owing to aging-related pro-
gressive aortic dilation and degeneration (32). Given
the expanding indication of TAVR for younger and
lower-risk patients, physicians will face this dilemma
in treating relatively younger patients with bicuspid
AS
and
concomitant
aortopathy.
Several
factors,
including
age,
comorbidities,
and
additional
risk
factors for aortic complications, must be considered
during the decision-making process to treat patients
with bicuspid aortic valve and concomitant aortop-
athy (33). Nevertheless, longer life expectancy in
those patient populations mandates future studies to
evaluate the effect of concomitant aortopathy, as well
as valve durability for long-term follow-up.
STUDY
LIMITATIONS. First,
this
study
had
the
inherent
limitations
of
an
observational
study
without center-independent adjunction of adverse
events
and
an
independent
core
laboratory
to
diagnose bicuspid AS and assess paravalvular leak.
Moreover, although propensity score matching is a
well-accepted approach in observational research to
address
differences
in
baseline
characteristics,
it
cannot account for unmeasured bias. Last, device se-
lection was not randomized, but was at the operator’s
discretion, and patient selection as well as operator
experience may have affected the observed outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS
Compared with tricuspid AS, TAVR in bicuspid AS was
associated with a similar prognosis, but a lower
device
success
rate.
Procedural
differences
were
observed
in
patients
treated
with
the
early-
generation devices, whereas no differences were
observed with the new-generation devices.

PERSPECTIVES
COMPETENCY IN PATIENT CARE AND
PROCEDURAL SKILLS: Compared with those with
tricuspid AS, patients with bicuspid valves undergoing
TAVR with early-generation devices more often
developed adverse procedural events, but there were
no significant differences between groups in
procedural complications with newer-generation
devices. Cumulative all-cause mortality at 2-year
follow-up was comparable between the bicuspid and
tricuspid groups.
TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Larger studies are
needed to evaluate the long-term outcomes and
durability of TAVR in patients with bicuspid AS.
