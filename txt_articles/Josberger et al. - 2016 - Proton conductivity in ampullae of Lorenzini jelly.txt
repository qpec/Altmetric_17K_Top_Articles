In 1678, Stefano Lorenzini first described a network of organs of unknown function in the torpedo ray—the
ampullae of Lorenzini (AoL). An individual ampulla consists of a pore on the skin that is open to the environment,
a canal containing a jelly and leading to an alveolus with a series of electrosensing cells. The role of the AoL
remained a mystery for almost 300 years until research demonstrated that skates, sharks, and rays detect very
weak electric fields produced by a potential prey. The AoL jelly likely contributes to this electrosensing function,
yet the exact details of this contribution remain unclear. We measure the proton conductivity of the AoL jelly
extracted from skates and sharks. The room-temperature proton conductivity of the AoL jelly is very high at 2 ±
1 mS/cm. This conductivity is only 40-fold lower than the current state-of-the-art proton-conducting polymer
Nafion, and it is the highest reported for a biological material so far. We suggest that keratan sulfate, identified
previously in the AoL jelly and confirmed here, may contribute to the high proton conductivity of the AoL jelly
with its sulfate groups—acid groups and proton donors. We hope that the observed high proton conductivity of
the AoL jelly may contribute to future studies of the AoL function.
INTRODUCTION
In 1678, Stefano Lorenzini observed long, tubular structures in the tor-
pedo ray (1). Named the ampullae of Lorenzini (AoL) in Lorenzini’s
honor, these organs are also present in sharks and skates (Fig. 1, A and
B). The function of the AoL remained a mystery for almost 300 years,
until Murray (2) inferred their electrosensory function in 1960. The
AoL allow sharks, skates, and rays to detect changes in electric fields
generated by muscle contractions and the physiology of their potential
prey (3). An individual ampulla consists of a pore through the skin
that opens to the aquatic environment. This pore is connected to a
collagen canal enclosing an epithelium that secretes a jelly-like sub-
stance (AoL jelly). This canal runs subdermally to an alveolus that
contains electrosensitive cells (Fig. 1C) (4). Within the alveolus, the
electrosensitive cells of the ampullae communicate with neurons (4).
Remarkably, the integration of signals from many ampullae allows
sharks, skates, and rays to detect changes in the electric fields as small
as 5 nV/cm (5–7). It is likely that the electrical properties of the AoL
jelly play a key role in this mechanism. How such weak electric fields
transmit along the AoL canal to electrosensory cells is subject to de-
bate (6, 7). Different electrical properties of the AoL jelly are reported
in the literature (8–11). The AoL jelly is reported either as a semi-
conductor with temperature dependence conductivity and thermo-
electric behavior (8, 9) or as a simple ionic conductor with the same
electrical properties as the surrounding seawater (10, 11). Here, using
proton-conducting devices, we demonstrate that the AoL jelly is a re-
markable proton-conducting material, and we speculate that the poly-
glycans contained in the AoL jelly may contribute to its proton
conductivity.
RESULTS
Materials observations
We collected samples by squeezing AoL jelly from visible surface pores
on the skin of bonnethead shark (Sphyrna tiburo), longnose skate
(Raja rhina), and big skate (Raja binoculata) (Fig. 1, A and B, and fig.
S1). After storing at −20°C, we deposited the AoL jelly directly onto the
sample surface without further processing. For all species, the resulting
AoL jelly is thick, viscous, and optically clear (Fig. 1E). We exposed AoL
jelly samples to 90% relative humidity (RH) for 30 min and hydrated
them to 97% water content as measured by thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA) (fig. S2). This water content is consistent with previous reports
(10, 11). If allowed to dry in air, the volume of the sample decreases by
approximately 80%, corroborating the known fact that the jelly is a
hydrogel with a high water content.
dc electrical measurements with PdHx
proton-conducting contacts
We performed initial electrical measurements in a standard two-
terminal geometry with palladium (Pd) source and drain contacts
(Fig. 2A) (12–15). When Pd is exposed to hydrogen, Pd forms palladium
hydride (PdHx) with a stoichiometric ratio x ≤ 0.6. With a source-drain
potential difference, VSD, the PdHx source and drain inject and drain
protons (H+) into and from the AoL jelly samples, effectively serving
as protodes (12–15). For each H+ injected into the AoL jelly, an excess
electron is collected by the leads, which complete the circuit and result
in a current measured at the drain, ID (Fig. 2A). For an applied VSD =
1 V, we measured ID at room temperature as a function of time (t) in
an atmosphere of nitrogen or hydrogen with controlled RH, as we have
previously done for the biopolymer melanin (16). For RH = 50%, the
AoL jelly samples extracted from R. rhina have very low electrical con-
ductivity with ID ~ 3 nA when measured with electrically conducting
and proton-blocking Pd contacts exposed to nitrogen (Fig. 2B, black
curve). At low RH, the only contribution to ID is likely from electrons,
because ions and protons require a highly hydrated material to con-
duct (17). For RH = 75%, ID increases with a 10-nA peak when mea-
sured with Pd contacts (Fig. 2B, blue curve). The formation of a Debye

 layer from the ions blocked at the contact–AoL jelly interface causes
ID to rapidly decrease to 0.3 nA at t = 20 s. Because Pd contacts block
ions and protons, ID = 10 nA is likely the ionic component to the
transient current in the AoL jelly, which contains the same ionic spe-
cies as seawater (table S1) (11). The observed capacitance (22 nF) is
consistent with the estimated capacitance for ionic charging of the Pd–
AoL jelly interface (26 nF) (table S1). We observed a similar behavior
for ionic currents in the biopolymer melanin (16). This ionic compo-
nent corresponds to an ionic conductivity of the AoL jelly, sion =
100 nS/cm. This sion is rather low compared to the conductivity of
seawater (≈40 mS/cm), which was also attributed to the AoL jelly
by previous work (11). However, larger ions such as Na+ and Cl− re-
quire larger pores in the material to be able to diffuse, and low ionic
conductivity of the AoL jelly was also previously observed (18). For
proton-conducting PdHx contacts at 75% RH, ID peaks at 250 nA,
indicating a strong component of proton conductivity (Fig. 2B, red
trace). This proton conductivity is consistent with the activation
energy for the conductivity of shark AoL jelly (11). With PdHx
contacts, ID drops over time. At first sight, this time dependence may
suggest proton-blocking behavior at the contact. However, we ob-
served similar time dependence when measuring highly proton-
conducting materials such as Nafion with PdHx contacts (14). This
time dependence arises when the diffusion of hydrogen to the PdHx
contact surface is slower than the conduction of H+ in the proton-
conducting material (14).
We also measured the proton conductivity (sH+) of AoL jelly ex-
tracted from big skate (R. binoculata) and bonnethead shark (S. tiburo)
(fig. S3). The AoL jelly for all species is proton-conducting with a five-
fold range in sH+. The AoL jelly from big skate is more conducting
than the AoL jelly from bonnethead shark, which is, in turn, more
conducting than the AoL jelly from longnose skate. The time depen-
dence of ID is consistent with the differences in sH+ and our previous
observations with Nafion (14). Although it is likely that some differ-
ences in sH+ across species are intrinsic to the AoL jelly, the small
differences in sH+ measured with these devices may also arise because
of variance in device geometry. It would be certainly of interest to per-
form a systematic study of the AoL jelly conductivity across species, as
well as age and gender of the subjects.
Four-point probe measurement and kinetic isotope effect
The injection of protons from the contact into the AoL jelly incurs a
significant contact resistance, and the depletion of H at the PdHx
contacts causes a drop in ID as observed in our previous work (14).
To circumvent these issues, we used a modified four-point probe
geometry to measure the proton conductivity (sH+) of the AoL jelly
independently of the PdHx–AoL jelly contact resistance. In this geom-
etry, we added two thin Au contacts between the Pd source and drain,
for a total of four contacts. When we apply VSD to the PdHx source
and drain, a current of H+ flows in the AoL jelly, as demonstrated in the
standard two-probe geometry. We measured the potential difference
between the two Au contacts. This potential difference is proportional
to ID and inversely proportional to the conductivity of the AoL jelly
(Fig. 2C). Because no current flows across the Au–AoL jelly interface,
there is no potential drop and the PdHx contact resistance does not
affect the measurement of the conductivity of the AoL jelly. For Pd
contacts at 90% RH, we find sion ≈ 100 to 1000 nS/cm depending
on VSD (Fig. 2D, blue trace), which is consistent with our observations
in the two-probe geometry (Fig. 2B). For PdHx contacts at 90% RH,
we find sH+ ≈ 6 to 200 mS/cm, peaking at 200 mS/cm for VSD = 1 V
(Fig. 2D, red trace). This conductivity is similar to that of dialyzed AoL
jelly from a shark in a dc measurement (800 mS/cm) (11). In our mea-
surements, the proton conductivity of the AoL jelly depends exponen-
tially on VSD, which is similar to the highly proton-conducting polymer
Nafion (19). To confirm that the AoL jelly conductivity arises from
H+, we repeated the measurements by hydrating the sample with deu-
terated water and by exposing the Pd to deuterium rather than to hy-
drogen. Deuterium ions (D+) transport along hydrated materials in a
similar fashion as protons, but with lower mobility and associated
lower conductivity (20). Hydrating the AoL jelly samples with D2O
substitutes D+ for H+ in the material. A subsequent decrease in con-
ductivity for D+ (sD+)—the kinetic isotope effect—is a well-accepted
signature for conductivity arising predominantly from protons (20).
For the AoL jelly, sD+ = 1/2sH+ for any VSD when measured in the
four-point probe geometry (Fig. 2D, green trace). The kinetic isotope

 effect with this four-point probe measurement unequivocally points to
proton conduction in the AoL jelly (20). However, these measurements
likely underestimate the AoL jelly conductivity (sH+ = 0.2 mS/cm).
In the four-point probe geometry, we find the proton conductivity of
Nafion at sH+ = 2 mS/cm, which is lower than the literature value
(sH+ = 78 mS/cm) (21). This measured conductivity of the Nafion
control sample is smaller than expected. We suspect that non-ideal
geometry is the cause of this variation. The calculated conductivity
assumes that only the material in the channel is relevant to conduc-
tion, because the electric field is highest here. However, if the interface
resistance is comparable to the channel resistance, this assumption
may not be accurate, skewing the calculated results (22). To address
this variation, we measured the proton conductivity of the AoL jelly in
a transmission line geometry.

 Transmission line measurement
We constructed devices with different lengths between the Pd source and
the drain to estimate the proton conductivity of the AoL jelly (Fig. 2E).
This varying source-drain length (LSD) geometry is commonly known
as a transmission line measurement (TLM) (Fig. 2E) (23). We applied
VSD = 1 V on devices with LSD ranging from 0.25 to 5.0 mm, mea-
sured ID, and calculated the resistance of each device, RL. Because dif-
ferent devices contained AoL jelly of different thicknesses, we multiplied
RL by the AoL jelly thickness to get the normalized resistance RLN and
plotted RLN as a function of LSD (Fig. 2F). In this geometry, the resistance
of the AoL jelly increases linearly with LSD, but the contact resistance at
the source–AoL jelly and drain–AoL jelly interface is constant. To ex-
trapolate the resistivity of the AoL jelly, we plot RLN as a function of
LSD. The slope of this plot is proportional to the resistivity of the
AoL jelly, and the intercept on the RLN axis for LSD = 0 is the contact
resistance. For the AoL jelly, we obtain sH+ = 1.8 ± 0.9 mS/cm, which is
only one order of magnitude lower than the proton conductivity of Na-
fion sH+ = 28 ± 14 mS/cm measured in the same geometry (fig. S4).
The proton conductivity of the Nafion control sample (28 ± 14 mS/cm)
measured in a TLM geometry is much closer to the reported value of
78 mS/cm (21). Therefore, we conclude that sH+ = 1.8 ± 0.9 mS/cm
measured for the AoL jelly in the TLM geometry is our best estimate
of the proton conductivity of the AoL jelly.
Materials characterization
When working with biological materials, characterization is often
challenging because many components are present and further pro-
cessing to separate these components may change the materials prop-
erties and function. Here, we chose to perform a preliminary analysis
on the as-extracted AoL jelly to look for the components that might
provide the high protonic conductivity. Although the AoL jelly likely
contains a mixture of proteins and polyglycans, we focus on the sul-
fated polyglycan keratan sulfate (KS) (Fig. 3A) following an early
report by Doyle (24). We characterized the AoL jelly from the skate
(R. binoculata) using monosaccharide compositional analysis and
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. In the monosac-
charide composition analysis, we find a nearly 1:1 ratio of glucosamine
to galactose (Fig. 3B). This ratio is consistent with the presence of KS
in the AoL jelly and corroborates Doyle’s analyses (24). However, the
presence of other sulfated polyglycans or polysaccharides cannot be
completely ruled out at this time. The FTIR spectrum of the AoL skate
jelly also contains the signature peaks of KS (Fig. 3C), including the
peak at 1238 cm−1 attributed to S==O vibrations of the sulfate group
(25). The sulfate group in the KS is an acid [pKa (where Ka is the acid
dissociation constant) = 2] (26), which donates the protons that con-
tribute to the proton conductivity of the material (13, 15). By compar-
ison, the sulfonic group in Nafion is a stronger acid, so Nafion has
correspondingly higher charge carrier density and proton conductivity
(21). However, proton conduction requires both a high carrier density
and a high carrier mobility, so creating pathways for proton transport
is also essential. KS has several hydrophilic groups that may induce the
organization of water in the AoL jelly into hydrogen bond chains,
allowing proton conduction according to the Grotthuss mechanism
(27). Chitin-derived polysaccharides functionalized with acid and base
groups are also good proton conductors and have chemical similari-
ties to KS (12, 13). Charged amino acids in the squid protein reflectin
also contribute to its high proton conductivity (28, 29). Further inves-
tigations into the composition and microstructure of the AoL jelly
and its correlation to the AoL jelly proton conductivity across species
are necessary to create a complete picture of the AoL high proton
conductivity.
DISCUSSION
With two and four terminal devices using proton-conducting PdHx
contacts, we measured the proton conductivity of the jelly extracted
from the AoL of skates and sharks. The proton conductivity of the
AoL jelly is as high as sH+ = 2 mS/cm. This value is the highest reported

 for the proton conductivity of any biological material, and it is only
40 times lower than the proton conductivity for Nafion, the current
state-of-the-art polymer proton conductor (table S2). We performed
preliminary characterization of the AoL jelly, and we reconfirmed
the presence of the polyglycan KS. We propose that the high proton
conductivity of the AoL jelly may arise from protons donated by the
KS acid groups to the water contained in the hydrated jelly. This
high proton conductivity of the AoL jelly is remarkable, and we hope
that the observation of this conductivity may contribute to future
studies of the AoL electrosensing function.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
AoL jelly preparation
We extracted AoL jelly from freshly caught and recently expired R.
binoculata (big skate), R. rhina (longnose skate), and S. tiburo
(bonnethead shark). AoL jelly was pressed from visible surface pores
and collected with a mechanical plunger-style pipette. Samples were
stored at −20°C until use. Just before measurement, the AoL jelly
was thawed at room temperature and then spun in a centrifuge at
6000 rpm to remove air bubbles. The AoL jelly was then drop-cast
onto substrates using a syringe. Because of the thick, viscous nature
of the AoL jelly, precise volume control was difficult.
Electrical measurements
Electrical measurements were performed on a Signatone H-100 probe
station using a custom atmospheric isolation chamber. Dakota Instru-
ments mass flow controllers were used to set the ratio of dry nitrogen,
wet nitrogen, hydrogen, and deuterium controlled by a LabView
DAQ. An Agilent 4155C semiconductor parameter analyzer was used
for all electrical measurements.
dc transient measurements
Two-terminal measurements were performed on Si substrates with a
100-nm SiO2 layer. Pd contacts were deposited by conventional photo-
lithography and e-beam evaporation. Contacts were 30 mm wide with
a 1-mm separation. The Pd contacts were 60 nm thick with a 5-nm Cr
adhesion layer. The AoL jelly layer was typically 50 mm thick.
Kinetic isotope effect measurements
Samples were saturated with either water (H2O) and hydrogen gas
(H2) or deuterated water (D2O) and deuterium gas (D2). Samples
were held for 30 min after switching to allow the diffusive exchange
of ions.
Transmission line measurements
Samples consisted of 100-nm Pd contacts with a 5-nm Cr adhesion
layer deposited on glass slides. Mylar shadow masks were used to
define 5-mm-wide contacts with LSD = 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0,
4.0, and 5.0 mm. The sample thickness was usually around 1 mm.
Measurements were performed at VSD = 1 V.
Four-point probe measurements
Samples were fabricated on Si wafers with a 100-nm SiO2 layer. Con-
ventional photolithography was used to separately pattern Pd and Au
contacts. Pd contacts were 30 mm wide and 60 nm thick and were sep-
arated by a 6-mm gap. Two Au contacts were deposited between the
Pd contacts. Au contacts were 50 nm thick and 1 mm wide and were
separated by a 1.5-mm gap. Both Pd and Au contacts had a 5-nm Cr
adhesion layer. The AoL jelly layer was typically 50 mm thick.
Compositional analysis
An AoL jelly sample was taken from a freshly caught and recently
expired skate (R. binoculata). This sample was separated into 0.5-ml
aliquots and frozen at −80°C. One of the aliquots was sent to the Bio-
technology Core Resources Laboratory in San Diego and used for
monosaccharide compositional analysis via high-performance anion
exchange chromatography (HPAEC) with pulsed amperometric detec-
tion (PAD). The sample (0.1 mg) was treated with 200 ml of 2 M tri-
fluoroacetic acid at 100°C for 4 hours to cleave all glycosidic linkages
and processed further for monosaccharide composition and detection.
This analysis method breaks down polymers into monomers and, in
the process, also breaks down any sulfate and acetyl side chains.
Monosaccharide standards were treated in a parallel fashion and used
for calibration of HPAEC-PAD.
FTIR spectroscopy
FTIR spectra were recorded with a Bruker VERTEX 70 FTIR spectro-
photometer (4000 to 400 cm−1, 4 cm−1 resolution) working in attenuated
total reflectance (ATR) mode. One droplet of skate jelly was carefully
placed on the ATR crystal and allowed to dry for 30 min. Then, we
recorded the FTIR spectrum.
