Guided graded exercise self-help plus specialist medical care 
versus specialist medical care alone for chronic fatigue 
syndrome (GETSET): a pragmatic randomised controlled trial
Lucy V Clark, Francesca Pesola, Janice M Thomas, Mario Vergara-Williamson, Michelle Beynon, Peter D White
Summary
Background Graded exercise therapy is an effective and safe treatment for chronic fatigue syndrome, but it is therapist 
intensive and availability is limited. We aimed to test the efficacy and safety of graded exercise delivered as guided 
self-help.
Methods In this pragmatic randomised controlled trial, we recruited adult patients (18 years and older) who met the 
UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome from two secondary-care 
clinics in the UK. Patients were randomly assigned to receive specialist medical care (SMC) alone (control group) or 
SMC with additional guided graded exercise self-help (GES). Block randomisation (randomly varying block sizes) was 
done at the level of the individual with a computer-generated sequence and was stratified by centre, depression score, 
and severity of physical disability. Patients and physiotherapists were necessarily unmasked from intervention 
assignment; the statistician was masked from intervention assignment. SMC was delivered by specialist doctors but 
was not standardised; GES consisted of a self-help booklet describing a six-step graded exercise programme that 
would take roughly 12 weeks to complete, and up to four guidance sessions with a physiotherapist over 8 weeks 
(maximum 90 min in total). Primary outcomes were fatigue (measured by the Chalder Fatigue Questionnaire) and 
physical function (assessed by the Short Form-36 physical function subscale); both were self-rated by patients at 
12 weeks after randomisation and analysed in all randomised patients with outcome data at follow-up (ie, by modified 
intention to treat). We recorded adverse events, including serious adverse reactions to trial interventions. We used 
multiple linear regression analysis to compare SMC with GES, adjusting for baseline and stratification factors. This 
trial is registered at ISRCTN, number ISRCTN22975026.
Findings Between May 15, 2012, and Dec 24, 2014, we recruited 211 eligible patients, of whom 107 were assigned to the GES 
group and 104 to the control group. At 12 weeks, compared with the control group, mean fatigue score was 19·1 (SD 7·6) 
in the GES group and 22·9 (6·9) in the control group (adjusted difference –4·2 points, 95% CI –6·1 to –2·3 , p<0·0001; 
effect size 0·53) and mean physical function score was 55·7 (23·3) in the GES group and 50·8 (25·3) in the control group 
(adjusted difference 6·3 points, 1·8 to 10·8, p=0·006; 0·20). No serious adverse reactions were recorded and other safety 
measures did not differ between the groups, after allowing for missing data.
Interpretation GES is a safe intervention that might reduce fatigue and, to a lesser extent, physical disability for 
patients with chronic fatigue syndrome. These findings need confirmation and extension to other health-care settings.

Introduction
Chronic fatigue syndrome is characterised by chronic, 
disabling fatigue in the absence of an alternative diagnosis.1 
Myalgic encephalomyelitis is thought by some to be the 
same disorder, whereas others consider it a different 
illness.1 The prevalence of chronic fatigue syndrome in the 
UK and US population varies between 0·2% and 2·6%,1 
depending on definition, and the prognosis is poor if 
untreated, with a median of 5% of patients recovering.2
The UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 
(NICE) recommends graded exercise therapy (GET) and 
cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) as treat 
ments.3 
However, patient organisations in the UK have reported, on 
the basis of survey results, that GET might at times be 
harmful and have recommended different management 
approaches such as pacing (ie, living within the limits 
imposed by the illness).4,5 In a 2016 Cochrane review of 
eight randomised controlled trials,6 exercise therapy was 
more effective in improving both fatigue and physical 
functioning than either passive treatments or no treat 
ment. 
GET delivered by specialist therapists, as used in these 
trials, is intensive and expensive, with up to 15 sessions 
required over a 3–6 month period.6,7 Further 
more, access to 
clinics that provide these inter 
ventions might be 
unavailable.8

Chalder and colleagues9 found that a self-help approach 
based on CBT benefited patients with fatigue in the 
community, but not all patients in this study met the 
criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome. Two trials10,11 of self-
help management approaches for chronic fatigue 
syndrome based on CBT principles have been done, but 
self-help approaches based on GET principles have not 
been tested in clinical trials so far. We designed the 
graded exercise therapy guided self-help trial (GETSET)12 
to compare the efficacy and safety of guided graded ex-
ercise self-help (GES) added to specialist medical care 
(SMC) with SMC alone. We hypothesised that GES plus 
SMC would be more efficacious in improving fatigue 
and physical function than, and as safe as, SMC alone.
Methods
Study design
GETSET was an open-label, pragmatic randomised 
controlled trial done at two UK National Health Service 
(NHS) secondary-care clinics for chronic fatigue 
syndrome in central London and Kent, a more rural area. 
The study was approved by the UK National Research 
Ethics Service Committee London—London Bridge 
(reference 11/LO/1572) on the Nov 23, 2011. We followed 
ethical guidance from the Medical Research Council 
Good Clinical Practice Guide, which recommends 
adherence to the 1996 version of the Declaration of 
Helsinki. The study protocol has been published.12 At the 
time of publication, approvals were being sought to make 
suitably 
anonymised 
data 
available 
for 
external 
researchers to request through the Yale University Open 
Data Access (YODA) Project, which is prepared to share 
these data. The YODA Project is an independent 
organisation that advocates for the responsible sharing of 
clinical research data. Data from available clinical trials 
are shared through the YODA Project with registered 
users with approved proposals for scientific research.
Participants
We recruited adult patients (aged 18 years and older) 
attending these clinics who were diagnosed with chronic 
fatigue syndrome and placed on a waiting list for therapy. 
Several diagnostic criteria exist for chronic fatigue 
syndrome.3,13,14 In this trial, we recruited par 
ticipants who 
met the NICE criteria,3 which are used by NHS clinicians. 
The NICE criteria require at least 4 months of clinically 
evaluated, unexplained, persistent, or relapsing fatigue 
with a definite onset that has resulted in a substantial 
reduction in activity and that is characterised by 
postexertional malaise or fatigue, or both.3 They also 
require at least one of ten related symptoms: difficulty 
sleeping, headaches, cognitive dysfunction, general 
malaise or flu-like symptoms, painful lymph nodes, sore 
throat, physical or mental exertion making symptoms 
worse, dizziness or nausea, palpitations, or multisite 
muscle or joint pain without evidence of inflammation.3 
Medical assessment by the clinic doctor included history, 
physical, and mental state examinations, and laboratory 
tests, as recommended by NICE,3 before trial entry to 
exclude alternative diag 
noses. Participants were also 
assessed by the US Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC) criteria13 and the Oxford criteria14 for 
chronic fatigue syndrome. The structured clinical interview 
from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 
Disorders IV was used to diagnose both exclusionary and 
allowable comorbid psychiatric disorders.15
Patients were excluded if they were younger than 
18 years, had current suicidal thoughts or comorbid 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed, PsychINFO, and the Cochrane Library 
from database inception until Aug 1, 2016, without language 
restrictions, for full reports of randomised controlled trials, 
systematic reviews, and meta-analyses using the search terms 
“chronic fatigue syndrome”, “myalgic encephal*”, “self-help”, 
“self-management”, “self-care”, and “self-instruction”. 
We excluded trials of adolescents, education, and group 
interventions. Chalder and colleagues found that a self-help 
approach based on cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) 
benefited patients with fatigue in the community, but not all 
patients in that study met the criteria for chronic fatigue 
syndrome. After excluding studies in which participants had 
unexplained fatigue but were not diagnosed with chronic 
fatigue syndrome, we identified two randomised controlled 
trials. Knoop and colleagues found that “guided 
self-instruction”, provided by a cognitive behavioural therapist 
using a booklet, improved fatigue and disability more than 
being on a waiting list. Tummers and colleagues found that the 
same approach delivered by psychiatric nurses improved 
fatigue, but not social or physical functioning, more than being 
on a waiting list. We found no trials of self-help management 
for chronic fatigue syndrome based on guided exercise 
therapy principles.
Added value of this study
In GETSET, a guided self-help management approach, when 
added to specialist medical care, improved symptomatic fatigue 
and physical functioning more than did specialist medical care 
alone. This was also the case in two subgroups of patients who 
met the Oxford criteria and US Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome. The 
intervention was at least as safe as specialist medical care alone.
Implications of all the available evidence
Guided exercise self-help might be useful as an initial 
management approach for patients with chronic fatigue 
syndrome, but confirmation and extension to other health-care 
settings are needed.

psychiatric conditions requiring exclusion, had read the 
GES guide previously, had already received GET at one of 
the trial clinics, were unable to speak or read English 
adequately, or had physical contraindications to exercise.12 
Participants provided written informed consent before 
entry into the trial.
Randomisation and masking
Participants were randomly allocated to receive GES plus 
SMC (GES group) or SMC only (control group) by the 
King’s College London Clinical Trials Unit, after baseline 
consent  and assessment, independently of the trial team. 
Block randomisation (randomly varying block sizes) was 
done at the level of the individual with a computer-
generated sequence and was stratified by centre, 
depression score according to the Hospital Anxiety and 
Depression Scale (HADS, ≤10 or ≥11),16 and severity of 
disability according to the Short-Form 36 physical function 
subscale (SF-36 PF, ≤40 and ≥45).17 After notification of 
intervention allocation, the trial manager  informed the 
participant. As with any trial with therapist and participant 
involvement, neither could be masked from intervention 
allocation. The trial manager was responsible for arranging 
remote randomisation and informing the participants and 
therapists of intervention allocation, and therefore could 
not be masked from intervention allocation. The trial 
statistician, Trial Steering Committee, and the Data 
Monitoring and Ethics Committee were masked from 
intervention allocation. 
Procedures
Before randomisation, all patients had at least one SMC 
consultation, delivered by doctors with specialist ex-
perience in chronic fatigue syndrome. SMC could involve 
prescriptions or advice regarding medication, as indi 
cated 
for symptoms or comorbid conditions such as insomnia, 
pain, or depressive illness. Although not routinely 
scheduled during the trial, further SMC sessions were 
available after randomisation for patients who required it, 
but it was not a standardised intervention.
In addition to SMC being available, participants in the 
GES group were given a copy of a self-help booklet18 
describing a six-step programme of graded exercise self-
management. The GES booklet was based on the 
approach of GET developed for the PACE trial7 and on 
NICE recommendations,3 and was iteratively developed 
with pilot patients with chronic fatigue syndrome. 
Participants were encouraged to use the six steps 
described in the booklet: stabilising a daily routine, 
starting regular stretching, deciding on a physical activity 
goal and choosing a type of activity with which to start, 
setting a physical activity baseline, increasing the 
duration of physical activity and finally the intensity.
The most commonly chosen exercise was walking. 
Importantly, if a participant found that their symptoms 
increased after an incremental change in their activity, 
they were advised to maintain their activity at the same 
level for longer than a week, until symptoms had settled, 
before considering another incremental increase. 
In the first session, which lasted 30 min, a physio-
therapist provided guidance on following the booklet and 
answered any questions from participants. This first 
session occurred within 5 working days of randomisation 
and was delivered face to face, by Skype, or by telephone. 
Up to three further appointments of 20 min each were 
offered over 8 weeks, and participants could choose to 
receive the guidance either by Skype or by telephone. 
Two experienced physiotherapists were trained to support 
the participants in using the booklet, but they were explicitly 
told not to provide therapy. During each session, they 
inquired about progress and answered any questions, with 
a focus on moving forward to the next step. They recognised 
achievements and provided feedback to participants on 
their efforts, with the aim of increasing motivation and self-
efficacy. Mid-way through the guidance intervention, the 
physiotherapist discussed setbacks with the participant. 
A therapy leader trained the two physiotherapists until they 
were deemed competent and then provided regular 
individual supervision. The physiotherapists followed a 
manual when delivering the guidance, and all participant 
guidance sessions were audio-recorded for supervision, 
feedback, and monitoring of treatment integrity. If a 
participant could not be contacted by telephone or Skype, 
an email was sent to re-engage them. 
Participants were assessed at baseline and 12 weeks after 
randomisation, roughly 4 weeks after GES guidance had 
ended. Participants were also followed up at 12 months 
after randomisation, and these results will be published in 
a separate paper. The trial manager undertook the baseline 
assessments either face to face in the clinic or via 
telephone or Skype. Follow-up questionnaires were sent 
by mail with freepost envelopes for return. If the follow-up 
questionnaires were not returned after reminders, the 
questionnaire was completed in the waiting room before 
the first clinic therapy appointment. All measures were 
self-rated by the participants.
The number of contacts with the physiotherapist 
during the trial, as well as the mode and duration of each 
contact, were recorded. At 12 weeks, participants were 
also asked in a questionnaire how satisfied they were 
with the help they had received during the study; the 
seven-point scale was condensed into four categories: 
dissatisfied (very or moderately dissatisfied), minimum 
(slightly dissatisfied, neither, or slightly satisfied), 
satisfied (moderately or very satisfied), and “did not 
receive help”. The physiotherapists rated participants on 
their health (with clinical global impression [CGI]), 
adherence to their GES programme on a five-point scale 
(completely, very well, moderately well, slightly, and not 
at all), and their acceptance of the therapy model (also 
completely, very well, moderately well, slightly, and not at 
all). Information was retrieved from NHS service 
computerised attendances to determine how many SMC 
sessions participants had received during the trial.

Outcomes
The two primary outcomes were fatigue—measured by 
the Chalder Fatigue Questionnaire19 (CFQ; Likert scoring 
0, 1, 2, and 3; range 0–33; highest score is most fatigue)—
and physical function, measured by SF-36 PF (range 
0–100; highest score is best function) 12 weeks after 
randomisation.17 These questionnaires are valid and 
reliable measures, and have been used in previous 
trials.6,7 The original protocol had only one primary 
outcome measure, the SF-36 PF. However, when some 
eligible participants were found to have high SF-36 PF 
scores at randomisation (because of their illness affecting 
cognitive or social functions but not physical function), 
we decided to also include fatigue, using the CFQ, as a 
co-primary outcome. This decision was made mid-way 
through trial recruitment (on June 20, 2013, after 
recruitment of 99 [47%] patients), before any outcome 
data had been examined, and was approved by the 
Research Ethics Committee, the Data Monitoring and 
Ethics Committee, and the Trial Steering Committee.12
The main secondary outcome was self-rated CGI score to 
assess change from baseline in overall health (CGI-health) 
and in chronic fatigue syndrome (CGI-CFS). These seven-
point scales were condensed into three categories: negative 
change (very much worse or much worse), minimum 
change (a little worse, no change, or a little better), and 
positive change (much better or very much better) for 
analyses.20 Other secondary out 
comes were anxiety and 
depression (measured by the Hospital Anxiety and 
Depression Scale),16 overall health (measured by Patient 
Health Questionnaire-13 [PHQ-13]),21 quality of life 
(measured by the Euroqol Questionnaire [EQ-5D]), 
22 global 
functioning (measured by the Work And Social Adjustment 
Scale [WSAS]),23 and physical activity (measured by the 
International Physical Activity Questionnaire [IPAQ]).24 We 
removed 
two 
symptoms 
(menstrual 
cramps 
and 
dyspareunia) from PHQ-15 to create PHQ-13 because these 
symptoms were not reported by patients of both sexes.21 
The IPAQ categorises patients as having undertaken a low, 
moderate, or high level of activity in the previous week.25 
Quality of life, (measured by EQ-5D) and economic 
measures will be reported separately in another paper. 
Safety outcomes were non-serious adverse events, 
serious adverse events, serious adverse reactions to trial 
interventions, serious deterioration, and active with-
drawal from intervention.12 Adverse events were self-
reported by participants in the follow-up questionnaire in 
response to specific questions regarding any new health 
problem since the start of the trial. Adverse events were 
considered serious if they involved death, hospital 
admission, increased severe and persistent disability, or 
self-harm, or when they were life-threatening or required 
an intervention to prevent one of these events. SMC 
clinicians and GES physiotherapists reported possible 
serious adverse events and reactions to the centre leader, 
and appropriate action was taken.12  Two suitably qualified 
scrutineers who were masked from intervention 
allocation reviewed all such adverse events, independently 
from the trial team, to establish whether there were any 
further serious adverse events. Disagreements were 
resolved by consensus between the two scrutineers. They 
were then unmasked from intervention allocation to 
establish if any serious adverse events were serious 
adverse 
reactions 
to 
trial 
interventions. 
Serious 
deterioration in health was defined as any of the following 
outcomes: a decrease in SF-36 PF score of 10 points or 
more between baseline and 12 weeks;17 scores of “much 
worse” or “very much worse” on the participant-rated 
CGI-health score;20 or active withdrawal from the 
intervention because of worsening.
Statistical analysis
Our original sample size calculation was based on use of 
the SF-36 PF as our primary outcome measure, but the 
significance level was reduced from 5% to 2·5% to 
accommodate two primary outcomes. In a previous trial 
of chronic fatigue syndrome and myalgic encephalo-
myelitis in secondary care (n=641),7 mean SF-36 PF 
scores were 37 (SD 15) at baseline and 48 (21) after 
12 weeks of practitioner-led GET (ie, an 11-point 
increase).7 On the basis of these findings7 and our 
estimate that GES would be less effective than therapist-
delivered GET, our sample size calculations were based 
on the assumption that a mean difference of 8 (SD 18) 
points between study groups at 12 week follow-up would 
be a clinically meaningful difference on the SF-36 PF 
scale. Thus, assuming a significance level of α=2·5% and 
a power of 80%, we required a minimum of 
98 participants in each group. This sample size was 
upwardly adjusted to allow for loss to follow-up and other 
adherence issues. Based on results from previous trials6,10 
we expected a roughly 10% loss to trial follow-up; 
therefore, we aimed to recruit 109 patients to each group 
(ie, a total of 218). Based on results from a previous trial 
of GET,7 in which the difference between baseline and 
12 weeks was 5·4 points on the CFQ,7 we assumed that a 
mean difference between intervention groups of 3 (SD 6) 
points would represent a clinically meaningful difference 
at 12 week follow-up. Hence, assuming a significance 
level of α=2·5% and a power of 80%, we required a total 
of 154 patients, which was within the 218 already planned.
We assessed data distribution of continuous measures, 
and normality of the data and regression residuals were 
explored. If the data were not normally distributed, they 
were transformed. Items with missing data on the pri 
mary 
and secondary outcome variables at baseline and follow-up 
were imputed with mean replacement (pro 
rating) when 
less than 20% of item responses per scale were missing.
In the primary analysis, we compared results from both 
the SF-36 PF and the CFQ at 12 weeks between study 
groups, adjusted with multivariable linear regression 
analyses. All randomised participants with outcome data 
at follow-up (ie, the modified intention-to-treat population) 
were included in analyses, regardless of any departure

367
from the allocated intervention. We adjusted models for 
study group, baseline measure of the outcome, and 
stratification factors (ie, study centre, depression score 
[high vs low], and baseline physical function [high vs low]). 
We estimated effect sizes using Cohen’s d, calculated by 
the adjusted mean difference between the two groups 
divided by the pooled SD at follow-up.
In the secondary analysis, we used the χ² analysis to 
assess the differences between study groups in the 
number of participants who achieved a clinically 
meaningful improvement on the SF-36 PF (ie, an 8  point 
increase) and the CFQ (ie, a 3-point decrease). We 
dichotomised the outcome measures using their 
corresponding clinically useful criteria and assessed the 
association 
between 
study 
group 
and 
clinically 
meaningful change score using a χ² test. For the two CGI 
scales, we compared the proportions of participants 
reporting a positive change, minimal change, or negative 
change across study groups using ordinal logistic 
regression, adjusting for our stratification variables.
To do a strict intention-to-treat analysis when more than 
20% of data from any questionnaire of any participant was 
missing for either the main outcomes or covariate 
variables, we imputed missing data using multiple impu-
tations by chained equations. Since multiple imputations 
rely on the assumption that data are missing at random, 
we included the prorated baseline outcome measures, 
covariates, and auxiliary variables associated with the 
outcomes and their so-called missingness in our impu-
tation model (ie, IPAQ and PHQ-13). Inclusion of auxiliary 
variables related to missingness has been found to 
produce more accurate estimates;26 therefore, we included 
the following auxiliary variables in the model: ethnic 
origin (white vs other), education level, employment 
status, and national patient organisation membership.
Following recent guidelines,27 we also did a sensitivity 
analysis that took into account the partially nested design 
of the study to assess the potential effect of the so-called 
therapist effect on our results. We did a further sensitivity 
analysis to adjust for potential confounders, including sex, 
age, employment status, ethnic origin, education level, 
anxiety, baseline IPAQ, and stratification factors. We did 
additional sensitivity analyses in the per-protocol 
population to investigate the robustness of the conclusions 
of the primary analysis, following departures from the 
random 
ised intervention policies. We first excluded 
participants in the GES group who did not attend any of 
the four guided support sessions, and then excluded 
participants in the control group who reported using a 
GET self-help approach. We also did a subgroup analyses 
in patients meeting the CDC13 or Oxford14 criteria for 
chronic fatigue syndrome, using regression analyses as 
implemented in our primary intention-to-treat analysis. 
This analysis was done to assess whether results were 
consistent 
regardless 
of 
the 
definition 
criteria 
implemented. We assessed whether the effect in the GES 
group was moderated by baseline levels of depression or 
severity of physical function (eg, our stratification factors). 
These subgroup analyses were exploratory.28
We used χ² tests, or Fisher’s exact test when appro-
priate, to describe differences in proportions of 
participant satisfaction between intervention groups and 
any diff 
erences in proportions with serious adverse 
events, serious adverse reactions to trial interventions, or 
serious deterioration (one or more vs none) between 
study groups. 97 patients from the GES group and 
101 patients from the control group were included in the 
safety analysis.
Finally, we did regression analyses, adjusted for 
baseline scores and stratification factors, for several 
secondary outcomes to assess the effect of study group 
on overall health and physical functioning (ie, WSAS, 
HADS, PHQ-13, and IPAQ). Because of the ordinal

nature of the IPAQ and CGI scales, we used ordinal 
regressions. Before conducting ordinal regressions, we 
checked for the proportional odds assumption using a 
Brent test. The two CGI scales met the assumption, but 
the IPAQ did not. Therefore, when analysing IPAQ 
results, we implemented a more flexible ordered logistic 
regression, which allows for partial proportional odds 
using the Stata command “gologit2”.29 All statistical 
analyses were done with Stata version 13 and SPSS 
version 22.

Results
Between May 15, 2012, and Dec 24, 2014, we screened 
683 patients, of whom 226 (33%) were assessed for 
eligibility and 211 (93%) were subsequently enrolled 
(figure). The most common reason for exclusion at initial 
clinician screening was failure to meet the NICE criteria 
for chronic fatigue syndrome (236 participants). 90 (24%) 
of 378 patients who were clinically eligible declined 
assessment or randomisation, although only 11 (3%) of 
these patients declined because they explicitly did not want 
GES. 104 patients were randomly allocated to the control 
group and 107 to the GES group. Two (2%) patients in the 
control group and ten (9%) patients in the GES group were 
lost to follow up (p=0·03; figure). Two (2%) participants in 
the GES groups and none from the control group actively 
withdrew from the intervention; this was not significantly 
associated with study group (p=0·50).
Baseline characteristics are shown in table 1. Most 
participants in the GES group attended four guidance 
sessions with a physiotherapist, and most reported 
satisfaction with GES (table 2).
12 week outcome data collection was completed on 
April 30, 2015. Follow-up questionnaires were returned 
after a mean of 92 days (SD 31) from randomisation. On 
the SF-36 PF, we had one participant (in the GES group) 
with one item missing at baseline and five (one in GES 
group and four in control group) with one item missing at 
follow-up. For the CFQ, we had five participants (two in 
GES group and three in control group) with one or two 
items missing at baseline and three (two in GES group and 
one in control group) with one item missing at follow-up. 
By prorating values for these participants, our modified 
intention-to-treat population included 102 participants in 
the control group and 97 in the GES group. After adjusting 
for baseline scores and stratification factors, participants 
who received GES scored 4·2 points (95% CI 2·3–6·1; 
p<0·0001) lower on the CFQ scale and 6·3 points 
(1·8–10·8; p=0·006) higher on the SF-36 PF scale than the 
control group at 12 week follow-up (table 3). The absolute 
effect sizes were 0·53 (0·24 to 0·81) for fatigue and 0·20 
(–0·08 to 0·48)  for physical function. Twice as many 
participants in the GES group improved by more than 
8 points on the SF-36 PF scale compared with the control 
group, and more participants in the GES group improved 
by at least 3 points on the CFQ compared with the control 
group (table 3). 33 (34%) of the 97 participants in the GES 
group improved by both at least 8 points on SF-36 PF and 
at least 3 points on the CFQ, compared with 14 (14%) of 102 
in the control group (χ² 11·4; p=0·001).
Strict intention-to-treat analysis, with imputed missing 
information included (n=211), confirmed the findings of 
the main analysis for the primary outcomes (table 4).

Adjustment for clustering at the physiotherapist level did 
not modify the results (intraclass correlation coefficient 0), 
and neither did limiting the analysis to participants who 
met either the Oxford criteria or the CDC criteria (table 4), 
nor adjusting for age, sex, ethnic origin, study centre, 
education level, employment status, high SF-36 PF, high 
anxiety, high depression, and baseline IPAQ scores (low, 
medium, or high). 
Non-serious adverse events were reported by about a 
quarter of participants in both study groups, with no 
significant difference between groups (table 5). Serious 
adverse events were uncommon (a participant attended 
Accident and Emergency [A&E] department after falling 
and damaging an arm; no fracture was found, and they 
were discharged; a participant attended A&E after 
twisting a knee, a damaged cartilage was diagnosed in 
the knee, and they were discharged; and a participant 
was admitted to hospital overnight for numbness in the 
right arm and leg, a neurologist assessed them and they 
were discharged the next day), and no serious adverse 
reactions were reported in either group. The difference 
in serious deterioration was not significant between 
study groups (table 5). Around a quarter of participants 
in both groups had deteriorations of 10 or more points in 
physical functioning, but more participants in the control 
group reported worsening in both CGI-health and CGI-
CFS (table 5). As a post-hoc sensitivity analysis, if we 
assume that all 13 participants without these follow-up 
data would have reported worsening, the two groups 
would not differ in terms of CGI-health (11 in GES group 
vs 11 in control group; χ² 0·01, p=0·94) and CGI-CFS 
(10 vs 12; χ² 0·27, p=0·60).
At 12 weeks, participants in the GES group were more 
likely to have had a positive change in both overall health 
and chronic fatigue syndrome on the CGI scale than did 
those after SMC alone (table 6). Seven (7%) patients in 
the control group reported a negative change for both 
overall health and chronic fatigue syndrome, whereas 
only one (1%) patient in the GES group reported a 
negative change for overall health and none reported a 
negative change in chronic fatigue syndrome. In view of 
the small cell sizes, we did a post-hoc sensitivity analysis 
using 10 000 Monte Carlo permutations to ascertain 
whether results might have been due to chance, and 
results from this analysis confirmed our findings 
(p=0·0002, 95% CI 0·00002–0·001 for overall health; 
p=0·0013, 0·0006–0·002 for chronic fatigue syndrome).
At 12 weeks, participants in the GES groups had better 
outcomes than did participants in the control group for 
work and social adjustment scores, depression, and 
anxiety, but not for general physical symptoms (table 7). 
Similarly, participants in the GES group were more likely 
to score high, rather than moderate or low, on physical 
activity (IPAQ) than those in the control group (table 7).
We found a significant effect for the interaction between 
study group and baseline physical functioning on the 
SF-36 PF scores at 12 weeks (mean difference –10·7, 
95% CI –19·7 to –1·6; p=0·02). After adjustment for 
covariates, patients in the GES group who had worse 
baseline physical functioning (ie, low SF-36 PF score) had

a higher mean score at follow-up (56·9, SE 3·3) than their 
counterparts in the control group (44·2, 3·3). Baseline 
physical function score also predicted the effect of the 
study group on both CGI-health score (odds ratio 0·1, 95% 
CI 0·02–0·64; p=0·01) and CGI-CFS score (0·1, 0·02–0·63; 
p=0·01). Participants in the GES group with poor baseline 
physical functioning were more likely to report 
improvement 
at 
follow-up 
(eight 
[20%] 
reported 
improvement in CGI-CFS and nine [23%] in CGI-health) 
whereas this was not observed in their counterparts in the 
control group (zero patients for both CGI-CFS and CGI-
health). Physical functioning did not moderate the effect of 
study group on fatigue (CFQ) as an outcome (mean 
difference –3.3, 95% CI –7·3 to 0·7; p=0·1). Depression 
did not moderate the effect of study group on the main 
outcomes (SF36: –7·1 [95% CI –16·7 to 2·5], p=0·2; CFQ: 
–3·3 [–7·3 to 0·72], p=0·1,; CGI-health: 2·7 [0·5 to 14·3], 
p=0·2; and CGI-CFS: 1·9 [0·4 to 10·4], p=0·5).
Three participants in the GES group did not attend any 
of the four guidance sessions, and were excluded in the 
per-protocol analysis. Exclusion of these participants did 
not alter the results for SF-36 PF (mean difference 6·5, 
95% CI 2·0 to 11·0; p=0·005) or CFS (–4·1, –6·0 to –2·2; 
p<0·0001). No patient in the control group reported 
using the GES guide at the 12 week follow-up.
Participants in the control group were no more likely to 
receive SMC sessions during the trial than those in the 
GES group. In the GES group, 28 (26%) of 107 patients 
attended one session, two (2%) attended two sessions, 
and none attended three sessions; in the control group, 
28 (27%) of 104 patients attended one session, two (2%) 
attended two sessions, and two (2%) attended three 
sessions (χ² 2·126; p=0·54).
Physiotherapist-rated data on adherence to GES were 
available for 104 (97%) participants offered GES; the 
remainder did not attend enough therapy sessions to be 
rated. The physiotherapists reported that 43 participants 
(42%) adhered to GES completely or very well, 31 (30%) 
moderately well, and 30 (29%) slightly or not at all.
Discussion
When added to SMC, GES significantly improved fatigue 
and physical functioning compared with SMC alone, and 
our findings held for patients meeting different diagnostic 
criteria for chronic fatigue syn 
drome. Significantly more 
participants exceeded pre 
defined clinically meaningful 
changes for fatigue, physical functioning, and both after 
GES plus SMC than after SMC. In the GES group, a 
similar proportion of participants improved by a clinically 
meaningful amount on both primary outcomes (34%) and 
scored themselves in the high range of physical activity 
(IPAQ; 30%) at follow-up, which provides some support 
for these thresholds. The greatest improvements in 
physical functioning after GES occurred in those with 
more physical disability. The mean differences in outcome 
between study groups exceeded a clinically meaningful 
threshold for fatigue but not for physical functioning. 
Since 34% (33 of 97) of participants in the GES group and 
14% (14 of 102) in the control group improved on both 
primary outcomes, five patients would need to be treated 
for one to benefit from GES. Using a higher threshold of 
improvement, 18% (17 of 97) rated their over 
all health as 
“much better” or “very much better” after GES. All but one 
secondary outcome (PHQ) showed similarly significant 
differences. Our sensitivity analyses sup 
ported the main 
findings, indicating that the results are robust. Of 
participants who remained in follow-up, most (85%) were 
satisfied with the support they had received with GES.
We were unable to compare two measures of the safety 
of the interventions because too few serious adverse 
events occurred, and no serious adverse reactions were 
reported in either study group. Significantly more

participants were lost to follow-up in the GES group than 
in the control group; a sensitivity analysis, assuming 
participants who withdrew would report worsening, found 
no significant difference in worsening between study 
groups. Two participants actively withdrew from GES, but 
neither reported their withdrawal as being due to the 
intervention causing them harm. The safety outcomes in 
this trial were consistent with those of physiotherapist-
delivered GET6—namely, no differences between GES 
and the control interventions.
GETSET is the first trial of GES for chronic fatigue 
syndrome to be published, but results from other trials of 
self-help approaches based on cognitive behavioural 
interventions suggest that behaviour-based self-help 
approaches might be helpful.10,11 In one of these studies,10 
the difference in SF-36 PF between intervention groups 
(5·7 points) was similar to our finding (6·3 points), and 
results from another study11 showed no difference in 
functioning 
but 
that 
minimal 
CBT-based 
self-
management significantly decreased fatigue compared 
with patients placed on a waiting list. As expected, a meta-
analysis6 of therapist-delivered, more intensive GET 
showed larger effects, with a 13·1 point difference in 
SF-36 PF at the end of the intervention compared with 
comparison interventions. In our trial, the difference in 
CFQ between groups (4·2 points) was at the upper limit 
of the 95% CI of the mean difference reported in the 
Cochrane review6 of therapist-delivered GET (2·82 points, 
95% CI 1·57–4·07), whereas the difference in SF-36 PF 
(6·3 points) was lower than that in the Cochrane review 
(13·10 points, 1·98–24·22).
To our knowledge, GETSET is the largest trial of self-
help interventions for chronic fatigue syndrome, and 
the findings are strengthened by the small number of 
dropouts (12 [6%] of 211) from trial follow-up. We were 
able to offer GES sessions face to face and by telephone 
and Skype; remote guidance was popular with 
participants, mitigating the fatiguing effects of travel for 
the intervention. Primary outcomes were self-reported 
by participants, thus preventing observer bias. Adverse 
events were categorised by independent scrutineers, 
and the safety outcomes were self-rated. Our finding 
that GES was more useful in those with worse physical 
functioning is reassuring and has been reported 
previously,11 but further exploration is necessary because 
it might be related to a ceiling effect in those with good 
physical functioning at baseline. This ceiling effect 
might also explain the relatively smaller difference in 
the effect size for physical function, which would reduce 
the overall difference between study groups.
Our trial has limitations. The results apply only to 
patients with chronic fatigue syndrome who are diagnosed 
in secondary care and referred for therapy. SMC was not 
standardised and we did not record its content. More 
participants were lost to follow-up in the GES group, 
although results of the sensitivity analysis were reassuring 
because serious deterioration was not different between 
the groups. We had only two physiotherapist clusters, and 
so estimates of the intraclass correlation coefficient might 
be inaccurate. 27 (25%) of 107 participants in the GES 
group received three or fewer sessions of guidance, which 
might reflect disengagement with the intervention; our

qualitative study will address this. All outcomes were self-
rated, which might lead to bias by expectation, although 
the effects of such self-rating are uncertain because of the 
mixed perception of GET.30 We did not measure any 
objective outcomes, such as actigraphy, which might have 
tested the validity of our self-rated measures of physical 
activity. The relative absence of intervention by diagnostic 
subgroup interactions might be related to the study not 
being powered to detect all interactions, including some 
that might have been clinically important. The clinical 
diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome is not straight-
forward, but we believe that our subgroup findings of 
similar efficacy in those meeting the Oxford and CDC 
criteria provide confidence that our findings are general-
isable. It is important to note that this trial was not 
designed to test causative factors in chronic fatigue 
syndrome, and the relative efficacy of a behavioural 
intervention does not imply that chronic fatigue syndrome 
is caused by psychological factors.
We suggest that these findings show that a guided self-
help intervention, when added to SMC, is a moderately 
effective intervention for fatigue, but has less effect on 
physical functioning, for people with chronic fatigue 
syndrome waiting for clinic therapy. These findings need 
confirmation in other health-care settings and testing of 
delivery by other health-care professionals.
