IMPORTANCE Inadequate adherence to recommendations known to reduce the risk of
sudden unexpected infant death has contributed to a slowing in the decline of these deaths.
OBJECTIVE To assess the effectiveness of 2 interventions separately and combined to
promote infant safe sleep practices compared with control interventions.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Four-group cluster randomized clinical trial of mothers
of healthy term newborns who were recruited between March 2015 and May 2016 at 16 US
hospitals with more than 100 births annually. Data collection ended in October 2016.
INTERVENTIONS All participants were beneficiaries of a nursing quality improvement
campaign in infant safe sleep practices (intervention) or breastfeeding (control), and then
received a 60-day mobile health program, in which mothers received frequent emails or text
messages containing short videos with educational content about infant safe sleep practices
(intervention) or breastfeeding (control) and queries about infant care practices.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was maternal self-reported
adherence to 4 infant safe sleep practices of sleep position (supine), sleep location (room
sharing without bed sharing), soft bedding use (none), and pacifier use (any); data were
collected by maternal survey when the infant was aged 60 to 240 days.
RESULTS Of the 1600 mothers who were randomized to 1 of 4 groups (400 per group), 1263
completed the survey (78.9%). The mean (SD) maternal age was 28.1 years (5.8 years) and
32.8% of respondents were non-Hispanic white, 32.3% Hispanic, 27.2% non-Hispanic black,
and 7.7% other race/ethnicity. The mean (SD) infant age was 11.2 weeks (4.4 weeks) and
51.2% were female. In the adjusted analyses, mothers receiving the safe sleep mobile health
intervention had higher prevalence of placing their infants supine compared with mothers
receiving the control mobile health intervention (89.1% vs 80.2%, respectively; adjusted risk
difference, 8.9% [95% CI, 5.3%-11.7%]),
room sharing without bed sharing (82.8% vs 70.4%; adjusted risk difference,
12.4% [95% CI, 9.3%-15.1%]), no soft bedding use (79.4% vs 67.6%; adjusted risk
difference, 11.8% [95% CI, 8.1%-15.2%]), and any pacifier use (68.5% vs 59.8%; adjusted
risk difference, 8.7% [95% CI, 3.9%-13.1%]). The independent effect of the nursing quality
improvement intervention was not significant for all outcomes. Interactions between the 2
interventions were only significant for the supine sleep position.

 A
national public awareness campaign (Back to Sleep) to
improve rates of supine infant sleep positioning to re-
duce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)
was successful in halving the US SIDS rate; however, in 2014
there were still approximately 3500 infant deaths due to SIDS,
accidental suffocation or strangulation in bed, or ill-defined
causes.1 The peak age incidence for these deaths to occur is
at 1 to 4 months, and 90% occur before the age of 6 months.2
Barriers to changing parental behavior regarding infant safe
sleep environments include concerns that the infant will not
sleep as well3-6 or will be more likely to aspirate3-7 when placed
in the supine sleep position. Adherence to supine sleep rec-
ommendations plateaued between 2001 and 2010, never
reaching target levels.8 Furthermore, US public health efforts
have been less successful in changing behaviors with regard
to bed sharing9 and soft bedding use.10 Although pacifier use
is associated with reduced SIDS risk,11 no interventions to in-
crease pacifier use have been published. In addition, there are
racial/ethnic disparities in adherence to infant safe sleep
recommendations.6,9,10,12
To address these issues, 2 separate complementary inter-
ventions to promote infant safe sleep practices were devel-
oped. A nursing quality improvement (NQI) intervention tar-
geted initial adherence,13 and a mobile health (mHealth)
messaginginterventionwasaimedatpromotingcontinuedad-
herence during the first 2 months of the infant’
s life.14,15 These
interventions were designed to use strategies that could be
widely implemented in a cost-effective manner if they are
proven effective. All interventions were branded with a name,
logo, and tagline (TodaysBaby: Helping You Make the Best
Choices for Your Baby).
The Social Media and Risk-Reduction Training (SMART)
study, a 4-group cluster randomized clinical trial (RCT), was
designed to assess these safe sleep interventions with similar
breastfeeding interventions used as controls.
Methods
Study Population
Recruitment
Mothers of healthy term infants were recruited from 16 US hos-
pitals that were selected from a nationally representative
sample of 32 hospitals with more than 100 deliveries annu-
ally (the hospitals are listed at the end of this article). The hos-
pitals were selected based on their history of successful re-
cruitment for the Study of Attitudes and Factors Effecting
Infant Care Practices (SAFE), a national study of infant care
practices,16-18 and their prestudy rates of parental adherence
to infant care practice recommendations. The trial protocol ap-
pears in Supplement 1.
Due to the known racial/ethnic disparities in adherence
to safe sleep recommendations,19 hospitals were provided
target recruitment numbers for Hispanic, non-Hispanic black,
and mothers of all other race/ethnicities in a manner identi-
cal to the strategy used in the SAFE study.16-18 Race/ethnicity
was self-reported using fixed categories from which to select.
Institutional review board approval was obtained from
Boston University, Yale University, the University of Virginia,
and all participating hospitals.
Randomization
A cluster randomized approach allowed hospitalwide imple-
mentation of the interventions. Sixteen hospitals were di-
vided into 4 groups that were balanced based on prestudy rates
of infant care (sleep and feeding) practices and geographic lo-
cation.Eachgroupofhospitalswasrandomlyassignedbycom-
puter-generated random numbers using a blocked randomiza-
tion scheme to 1 of the following 4 intervention combinations:
(1) breastfeeding NQI and breastfeeding mHealth; (2) safe sleep
NQI and breastfeeding mHealth; (3) breastfeeding NQI and safe
sleep mHealth; or (4) safe sleep NQI and safe sleep mHealth.
Enrollment
Enrollment at each hospital began after a median of 86 days
(range, 20-149 days) following NQI completion so that the hos-
pitals could begin enrollment in a rolling fashion between
March 2015 and May 2016. All mothers were enrolled during
the hospitalization for the birth. Mothers were excluded if they
were non-English speaking, did not live in the United States,
did not have custody of the infant, or could not receive daily
email or text messages. Other exclusions included if the in-
fant required hospitalization for more than 3 days, had con-
traindications to breast milk feeding (ie, feeding directly on the
breast or drinking pumped breast milk) or following safe sleep
guidelines, or was deceased.
Data Collection
After written informed consent was obtained, mothers pro-
vided demographic and contact information and were ori-
ented to their preferred email or text message platform. Using
proceduresidenticaltothoseusedintheSAFEstudy,16-18moth-

Key Points
Question Will 2 separate, complementary interventions (nursing
quality improvement intervention and mobile health intervention)
promote safe infant sleep practices?
Findings In a 4-group cluster randomized clinical trial with 1263
families, mothers who received a mobile health intervention with
regular text or email messages and videos reported statistically
significantly higher rates of placing their infants supine to sleep
compared with mothers who received control interventions
(adjusted prevalence, 89.1% vs 80.2%, respectively), room sharing
without bed sharing (82.8% vs 70.4%), no soft bedding use
(79.4% vs 67.6%), and any pacifier use (68.5% vs 59.8%).
A nursing quality improvement intervention did not influence
infant safe sleep practices.
Meaning A mobile health intervention improved adherence with
infant safe sleep practices. Whether widespread use of this type of
intervention is feasible and reduces sudden and unexpected infant
death rates remains to be studied.

 aged 150 days, mothers received reminders to complete the
survey until the infant was aged 240 days. Data collection
ended in October 2016.
Description of Interventions
NQI Interventions
The NQI interventions were designed to ensure that mothers
would hear key messages, and that there was appropriate role
modeling by hospital personnel. Because randomization was
at the hospital level, all mothers who delivered at a given hos-
pital were exposed during routine postpartum care to educa-
tion and role modeling resulting from the assigned NQI inter-
vention, along with any preexisting educational practices
performed at the hospital.
Mothers in all groups received basic information about
breastfeeding and safe sleep per hospital protocols, includ-
ing advice to bring the infant into the parental bed for feed-
ing, but to move the infant back into a separate sleep space
when the parent was ready for sleep, and to postpone paci-
fier use for directly breastfed infants until breastfeeding was
well established.
Study investigators developed the safe sleep and breast-
feeding control NQI interventions using prior successful
interventions,20-23 existing curricula,24-26 prior research on
barriers to adherence,3-5,7,27 and qualitative data from focus
groups with maternity unit staff at 2 large academic hospi-
tals (Yale New Haven Hospital and University of Virginia
Health System) as guides.
The NQI used a train-the-trainer model with local nurse
champions as coordinators, evidence-based educational ma-
terials that provided strategies for addressing barriers to safe
sleep3-5,7,27 and breastfeeding,28-32 and an emphasis on the im-
portance of role modeling best practices. Each hospital team
decided on and implemented NQI initiatives in plan-do-study-
act cycles. Following each cycle, hospital staff conducted un-
announced audits in which they observed maternal practices
and asked mothers about information received from staff.
mHealth Interventions
ThemHealthinterventionsprovidedongoingmessagingtimed
to anticipate likely adherence challenges. Study investigators
developed health messages and educational videos to be de-
livered by email or text messages to parents. The health mes-
sages and educational videos were reviewed by experts in safe
sleep, breastfeeding, health education, and social marketing
and by family caregivers of newborn infants (target audi-
ence). Videos contained parent testimonials, addressed com-
mon questions and barriers to safe sleep (intervention) or
breastfeeding(control),andweredeliveredattimeswhenthese
issues typically arise. For instance, because concern about as-
piration while an infant is placed in the supine sleep position
is a major reason for early prone placement, a video address-
ingthisconcernwasamongthefirstvideosmothersweregiven.
Video topics appear in eTable 1 in Supplement 2.
At enrollment while in the hospital, mothers answered
questions about current infant feeding status and feeding
plans after hospitalization and viewed the first 2 TodaysBaby
videos (safe sleep or breastfeeding; each approximately
3 minutes long). Within 24 hours, participants began re-
ceiving email or text messages (based on participant prefer-
ence) with TodaysBaby videos (lasting 60-90 seconds long).
Messages were delivered centrally by the study data center
using proprietary platforms (Mobile Commons for text mes-
sages; iContact for email). Mothers received daily messages
and videos for the first 11 days and then every 3 to 4 days
for 60 days.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was adherence to the following 4 in-
fant safe sleep practice recommendations from the American
Academy of Pediatrics: (1) infant sleep position (supine vs
other),(2)infantsleeplocation(roomsharingwithoutbedshar-
ing vs other), (3) pacifier use (any use vs no use), and (4) soft
bedding use (no soft bedding use vs other). Adherence was
measured by maternal responses to the survey, which asked
about usual practice during the past 2 weeks. Prespecified sec-
ondary outcomes regarding breastfeeding behavior are not re-
ported in this article.
Statistical Methods
Sample size was determined to provide adequate power of de-
tecting the effect of an individual intervention in the pres-
ence of an interaction. To account for the cluster randomized
design and generalized estimating equation logistic regres-
sion analysis, necessary sample size was determined through
simulation. Based on results from the SAFE study, we as-
sumed prestudy prevalence of a safe sleep practice ranging
from 50% to 60% across hospitals.18
Becauseclinicaltrialshavedemonstratedmodestimprove-
mentsininfantsafesleeppractices(increasesrangingfrom7%-
30% in supine sleep positioning and decreases ranging from
12%-28% in bed sharing14,33), we powered the study to detect
a 10 percentage point difference between 2 groups, and de-
termined that a sample size of 1280 (320 per treatment group)
was needed for 80% power (2-sided P < .05 with a Bonferroni
adjustment for multiple comparisons). Allowing for an antici-
pated 20% loss to follow-up, this led to an enrollment sample
size of 1600 (400 per group).
Surveyrespondentandnonrespondentdemographicchar-
acteristics were compared using a χ2 test. Prespecified statis-
tical analyses evaluated the 2 study interventions (NQI and
mHealth) on the sleep outcomes. Unadjusted and adjusted
analyses, controlling for infant age and sex; mother’
s age, par-
ity, educational level, marital status, and household income;
and the baseline between-group differences were performed
using generalized estimating equation logistic regression mod-
els to account for within-hospital clustering and to allow both
individual-level and hospital-level covariates.
Prevalence of safe sleep outcomes range from approxi-
mately 60% to 90%, and the usual interpretation of odds ra-
tios may be misleading given these common outcomes. There-
fore, we converted adjusted odds ratios and 95% CIs from the
logistic regression models to adjusted risk differences and 95%
CIs using the observed prevalence in the group that received
the control for both the NQI and mHealth interventions as the
control group prevalence.

 We first report on the separate effects of the NQI and
mHealth interventions based on the main effect models
with indicator variables for the 2 interventions. We then
fit multiplicative interaction models with indicator vari-
ables for the NQI intervention, mHealth intervention, and
their interaction. When the interaction between the 2 inter-
ventions was not significant, only the main effect model is
presented. When the interaction between the 2 interven-
tions was significant, the results from the interaction model
are also presented. To account for examining multiple out-
come measures, our original protocol called for calculating
Bonferroni-adjusted P values.

 Bonferroni procedure; therefore, Hochberg-adjusted P values
are presented to account for multiple comparisons. A second-
ary aim was to evaluate mediators of the intervention effects;
however, these analyses are not included in this article.
Imputation was planned if loss to follow-up was greater
than anticipated (ie, >20%). Even though the observed loss to
follow-up was at the anticipated rate of approximately 20%,
post hoc multiple imputation analyses were conducted. Based
on the fraction of missing data, 20 imputed data sets were gen-
erated using fully conditional specification methods. The pro-
cedures described above were followed for the multiple im-
putation analyses.

due to lack of ability to meet with the mother prior to hospi-
tal discharge. Therefore, 2550 (86.8%) were approached and
1600 (100 per hospital) provided written informed consent
(62.7%). The mean (SD) time to complete enrollment was
200 days (76 days; range, 81-361 days) and was largely depen-
dent on the annual number of births at each hospital. All hos-
pitals achieved 90% adherence with all NQI measures except
for encouragement of pacifier use before initiating mother
recruitment. The mHealth messaging intervention was not
correctly enabled on the cell phones of 20 women at enroll-
ment (these women did not receive the videos or queries)
and 337 were lost to follow-up.
The survey was completed by 1263 mothers (78.9% of
those enrolled; Figure). The mean (SD) maternal age was 28.1
years (5.8 years) and 32.8% of respondents were non-
Hispanic white, 32.3% Hispanic, 27.2% non-Hispanic black,
and 7.7% other race/ethnicity. The mean (SD) infant age was
11.2 weeks (4.4 weeks) and 51.2% were female. Survey nonre-
spondents were more likely younger than 30 years, black,
never married, and to not have attended college (P < .001 for
all). The characteristics of the respondents appear in Table 1.
The characteristics of both respondents and nonrespondents
appear in eTable 2 in Supplement 2. The rates of opening and
viewing messages were consistently higher than 50%.
Infant Safe Sleep Outcomes
The prestudy (from SAFE study participants) rates of paren-
tal adherence to infant safe sleep practices that were used as
baseline rates appear in Table 2. The demographic character-
istics of prior SAFE study participants used to calculate base-
line rates appear in eTable 3 in Supplement 2.
Safe sleep outcomes by group assignment appear in
Table 3. Mothers who received both the NQI and mHealth
safe sleep interventions had the highest rates of adherence
to all 4 recommended outcomes (92.5% for supine sleep
position, 85.9% for room sharing without bed sharing,
81.9% for no soft bedding use, and 76.2% for any pacifier
use), followed by mothers who received the breastfeeding
NQI and the safe sleep mHealth intervention (88.3% for
supine sleep position, 79.9% for room sharing without bed
sharing, 77.8% for no soft bedding use, and 69.3% for any
pacifier use).
In the prespecified adjusted analysis for supine sleep
position, the main effect model showed significantly greater
adherence to the safe sleep recommendation for those given
the mHealth intervention (adjusted prevalence in the inter-
vention and control group of 89.1% and 80.2%, respectively;
adjusted risk difference, 8.9% [95% CI, 5.3%-11.7%]) and no
significant effect for the NQI intervention. The interaction
model showed a significant interaction between the 2 inter-
ventions, suggesting that mothers receiving both the NQI and
mHealth interventions had better adherence to supine sleep
recommendations than mothers receiving the mHealth inter-
vention alone.
Because a significant interaction was not observed
between the 2 interventions for the other 3 safe sleep out-
comes, the separate effects of each individual intervention
are reported. In each case, the adjusted independent effect of
the mHealth intervention was significantly greater adherence
to the recommended sleep practice (adjusted prevalence for
usual room sharing without bed sharing was 82.8% in the
intervention group and 70.4% in the control group [adjusted
risk difference, 12.4%; 95% CI, 9.3%-15.1%]; no soft bedding
use: 79.4% and 67.6%, respectively [adjusted risk difference,
11.8%; 95% CI, 8.1%-15.2%], and any pacifier use: 68.5% and
59.8% [adjusted risk difference, 8.7%; 95% CI, 3.9%-13.1%]).
The adjusted independent effect of the NQI intervention did
not show improved adherence for any of these outcomes.

 Post hoc Analyses
Post hoc sensitivity analyses that accounted for loss to
follow-up through multiple imputation (eTable 4 in Supple-
ment 2) showed that the interaction between the NQI and
mHealth interventions was not significant for supine sleep
position. Although the effects for the mHealth intervention
were somewhat attenuated, they remained consistent with
the main analysis.
Aposthocanalysisinwhichthedatawerestratifiedbyrace
showed that even though control rates of the safe sleep out-
comes varied widely depending on race, the rates of benefi-
cialoutcomesforthegroupreceivingboththeNQIandmHealth
safe sleep interventions were similarly high regardless of race
(eTable 5 and eFigure in Supplement 2).
Discussion
In this RCT of 2 complementary interventions to improve in-
fant safe sleep practices, receiving a safe sleep mHealth inter-
vention resulted in increases in supine sleep position place-
ment, room sharing without bed sharing, no soft bedding use,
and any pacifier use at 2 months of age compared with con-
trols. The safe sleep NQI intervention alone did not signifi-
cantly affect any of these outcomes, although the significant
interaction for supine sleep position suggests that mothers re-
ceiving both the mHealth and NQI safe sleep interventions had
the highest adherence to supine sleep position placement.
There have been few RCTs to improve infant safe sleep
practices, and the rates of supine sleeping (92.5%) and room
sharing without bed sharing (85.9%) achieved in this study
are much higher than have been achieved in other trials. A
trial of educational interventions with US child care providers
improved reported supine sleep position placement from
65.0% to 87.8% and observed supine sleep position place-
ment from 51.0% to 62.1%.34 Individual education with
Brazilian mothers improved supine sleep position rates
2.2-fold 3 months after the intervention.35 A recent RCT of
health messages that emphasized the importance of suffoca-
tion prevention had no effect on infant sleep position or sleep
location, but demonstrated small significant decreases in soft
bedding use.36 To our knowledge, there have been no RCTs
to improve pacifier use.
The safe sleep NQI intervention did not influence infant
safe sleep practices. Other studies have found that mothers
usually intend to adhere to infant safe sleep practices before
they are discharged from the hospital, but that the challenges
of caring for a newborn may result in changes in practice.14
It is possible that hospital staff teaching and modeling
(although important in establishing the practice standard)
may not be sufficient, or that already existing hospital educa-
tional policies may have limited the incremental effect of this
NQI intervention.
The safe sleep mHealth intervention was effective in
improving infant safe sleep practices. It was particularly
effective for improving room sharing without bed sharing
and increasing elimination of soft bedding use, both of
which demonstrated absolute risk differences of greater

 than 10 percentage points. Even though improvements in
supine sleep position placement and any pacifier use were
statistically significant, these improvements did not meet
the study sample size–based minimal clinically important
difference of 10%.
The messages and videos were timed to address chal-
lenges and questions that arise at specific time points; there-
fore, providing this additional information to parents at criti-
caltimesmayhavebeenimportantinassuagingconcernsabout
adherence to recommended practices. Furthermore, receiv-
ing frequent videos and email or text messages may have
servedasavirtualsupportsystemformothers,reinforcingsafe
parental practices. Analyses of mHealth interventions for mul-
tiple health issues have found that messages tailored to clini-
cal situations and sent on a daily to weekly basis are associ-
ated with positive effects.37
There are persistent racial/ethnic disparities with regard
to adherence to infant safe sleep practices,6,9,10,12 and this was
reflected in the rates of adherence in the control group. How-
ever, in a post hoc analysis, these disparities were no longer
significant in the group receiving both the NQI and mHealth
safe sleep interventions. This analysis should only be consid-
ered as hypothesis-generating and requires further study be-
fore reaching any conclusions.
An important goal of this study was to test interventions
that, if effective, could be implemented widely and cost-
efficiently. Messages and scripts that could easily be incorpo-
rated in plan-do-study-act cycles to improve safe sleep teach-
ingweredeveloped.Furthermore,becausetheratesofopening
and viewing messages in this study were consistently higher
than 50% and almost all adults now have cell phones or email
access, it is likely that this type of intervention would be fea-
sible and well received by parents. Although it may seem la-
bor intensive to send daily messages, the email and text mes-
sages can be automated to easily reach large populations. In
addition,messagescanberetrievedasynchronouslywhencon-
venient to the patient.38 This study did not measure interven-
tion costs or the efficacy for clinical end points so it is pos-
sible that the intervention may not be cost-effective.
Limitations
This study had several limitations. First, there was a lost to
follow-up rate of 21%. Nonrespondents were predominantly
younger, black, single, and less well educated, which are
all factors typically associated with higher rates of non-
adherence with safe sleep recommendations. Although
this may indicate a lack of engagement in this subgroup,
respondents with similar demographics demonstrated
changes in practice (eTable 5 in Supplement 2). None-
theless, other approaches may be needed to reach these
mothers. Second, because enrollment was limited to English
speakers, the results cannot be generalized to non–English-
speaking populations. Third, the large majority of responses
(72.6%) occurred when infants were aged 8 to 12 weeks. It
will be important to assess continued adherence, particularly
as mothers return to the workplace. Fourth, this study was
not powered to assess adverse events. Fifth, this study did
not measure clinical outcomes (ie, rates of sudden unex-
pected infant death). Sixth, this trial has limitations inherent
in self-reporting.
Mothers who received the NQI and mHealth safe sleep
interventions may have been more reluctant to report prac-
tices inconsistent with the messages received in the interven-
tions, which would overestimate the effect of the messaging.
However, the prestudy levels for each behavior are compa-
rable with other studies,9,12,39 suggesting the validity of the
study methods used and the analyses adjusted for prestudy
between-group differences. Furthermore, to minimize
reporting bias, queries about infant care practices other than
sleep and feeding (eg, immunizations) were in the survey so
that specific outcome measures were less obvious. To mini-
mize contamination of the various intervention groups, a
cluster randomization scheme that randomized by hospital
was used. Given the consistency of results across all end
points, in the different groups, and with SAFE prestudy data,
these results are likely to be valid.
Conclusions
Among mothers of healthy term newborns, a mobile health in-
tervention, but not a nursing quality improvement interven-
tion, improved adherence to infant safe sleep practices com-
pared with control interventions. Whether widespread
implementation is feasible or if it reduces sudden and unex-
pected infant death rates remains to be studied.
