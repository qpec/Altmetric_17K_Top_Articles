oncolytic viral therapy

Abstract
With the recent regulatory approval of Talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC) for the treatment of advanced of
melanoma in the United States, Europe and Australia, oncolytic virus immunotherapy has earned its place in the
clinic. However, the adoption of T-VEC by the U.S. oncology community has been slow, and so far has been largely
limited to specialized cancer centers. Limiting factors include the intratumoral route of administration, which is
unfamiliar to medical oncologists, biosafety concerns related to the use of a live virus in the clinic, and the
explosion of other therapeutic strategies now available for the treatment of advanced melanoma. Herein, we review
the development of T-VEC, and suggest how it fits into the in the current clinical treatment paradigm, and provide
pearls for drug preparation, administration, and monitoring of response to therapy.
Introduction
There have been significant advances in the treatment of
cancer over the last five years. In addition to progress in
the development of targeted therapy and immunother-
apy, oncolytic virus therapy has emerged as another new
therapeutic option. Oncolytic viruses represent a novel
class of drugs in which native or modified viral vectors
are used for the treatment of cancer. The use of viruses
is based on early observations in the mid-1950’s that
some viruses could infect and kill leukemic peripheral
blood cells in vitro. Contemporary oncolytic virus ther-
apy mediates tumor regression through two distinct
mechanisms. First, many viruses possess an innate
tropism for cancer cells where they can preferentially
replicate and kill established tumor cells. Secondly, the
dying tumor cells can serve as a target for cross priming
tumor-specific immune responses generating systemic
anti-tumor immunity. This second mechanism is im-
portant since tumor cells that are not infected by virus
may nonetheless be targeted for elimination by the im-
mune system. While most oncolytic viruses are given by
direct injection into established tumors, several viruses
can be delivered by the intravenous route avoiding the
need for tumor localization and/or complex interven-
tional administration strategies. To date, the virus that
has gained the most attention is an attenuated herpes
simplex virus, type 1 (HSV-1) engineered to express hu-
man granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor
(GM-CSF), termed Talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC).
This virus has been specifically adapted for selective
tumor cell replication and induction of host immunity.
The virus has now been tested in a prospective, ran-
domized phase III clinical trial in which a significant
improvement in durable and objective response rates
were seen in patients with advanced melanoma. Based
on the study results, T-VEC became the first oncolytic
virus to achieve regulatory approval in the United
States, Europe and Australia.
The clinical implementation of oncolytic viruses is
complicated by the need to properly store, prepare and
administer the virus and the use of live, replicating
viruses may not be familiar to many practicing oncolo-
gists. In addition, special attention of biosafety, infec-
tion control and potential close contact transmission of
the virus demand additional education and training by
healthcare providers. In this brief report, we will briefly
characterize the first-in-class oncoloytic virus, describe
the clinical development pathway and safety profile of
the vector, and discuss appropriate systems for the safe

 use of oncolytic viruses in the clinic. Further clinical
studies of T-VEC in combination with other immuno-
therapy agents, as well as the emergence of multiple
new oncolytic viruses, can be anticipated in the near fu-
ture. The availability of T-VEC provides the treating
clinician and patient with another therapeutic options
for the treatment of patients with unresectable melan-
oma and lesions suitable for intratumoral injection.
Construction of Talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC)
T-VEC is a modified herpes simplex virus, type 1 (HSV-1)
[1] that has undergone genetic modifications to promote
selective tumor cell replication, while reducing viral
pathogenicity and promoting immunogenicity. Oncolytic
viruses mediate anti-tumor activity through a dual mech-
anism of action [2]. T-VEC replicates within neoplastic
cells, and accumulation of the virions leads to lysis of the
cancer cell, causing necrosis and cell death, which may
release tumor-associated antigens and prime anti-tumor T
cell responses. The preferential replication within tumor
cells is enhanced by deletion of the herpes virus ICP34.5
genes and this also eliminated the neuropathogenicity as-
sociated with HSV-1 infection [3]. Tumor cell replication
is also aided by the availability of a pool of nucleic acids in
cancer cells for transcription, and the adaptation of cancer
cells that often harbor disrupted anti-viral responses, spe-
cifically defects in interferon and protein kinase R (PKR)
signaling. Another key modification of T-VEC is the inser-
tion of two copies of the human cytokine granulocyte
macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) gene.
Local release of GM- CSF recruits dendritic cells and mac-
rophages into the tumor and promotes their maturation
[4]. The maturation of these cells allows the presentation
of tumor antigen to T cells in the regional lymph nodes,
where stimulation of tumor-specific CD8+ T cells occurs
[3, 5, 6]. In development of the virus, another genetic
modification, deletion of the viral ICP47 gene helps to fa-
cilitate antigen presentation and promotes anti-viral and
anti-tumor immunity [3, 5]. Additional particles are re-
leased when tumor cells lyse, such as damage-associated
molecular patterns (DAMPs) and pathogen associated
molecular patterns (PAMPs) that also attract and stimu-
late inflammatory cells.
Pre-clinical data demonstrated strong lytic activity
against several human tumor cell lines, including melan-
oma cells [5]. In the murine A20 tumor model,HSV-1
viral strains with and without GM-CSF gene expression
were evaluated using a bilateral flank system wherein
one flank was injected with virus and the contralateral
flank was not [5]. While both HSV-1 strains resulted in
regression of the directly injected tumor,, only HSV-1
encoding GM-CSF was able to inhibit tumors in the
contralateral flank. Furthermore, cytotoxic T lympho-
cytes (CTL) recognizing the parental A20 tumor cells
were only found in mice treated with HSV-1-GM-CSF.
Treatment with HSV-1-GM-CSF was also associated
with, protection from re-challenge with the same tumor
cells, suggesting the development of long-term anti-
tumor memory responses [5]. Based on these data, a
modified HSV-1 with deletion of the herpes virus
ICP34.5 and ICP47 genes, and encoding human GM-
CSF was generated. This virus construct was termed
Talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC; Imlygic™), and was
used for clinical evaluation.
Clinical development of T-VEC
In 2006, a Phase I clinical trial of T-VEC was con-
ducted to determine the safety profile, optimal dose
and schedule, and biologic effects of therapy [7]. This
study included 30 patients with refractory breast can-
cer (n = 14), head and neck cancer (n = 5), colorectal
cancer (n = 2), and melanoma (n = 9) who had tumors
in cutaneous, subcutaneous, or nodal sites that were
amenable to direct injection. The trial employed a sin-
gle dosing cohort and a multi-dosing arm in which an
initial low dose of virus was administered to allow
seroconversion of herpes virus naïve subjects. In the
single-dose group, patients were exposed to a single
dose of 106, 107, or 108 plaque-forming units (PFU)/
mL. In this group, the most common adverse event
was pyrexia, which was mostly mild (grade 1). Local
inflammation at the injected tumor site was also ob-
served, which tended to be more severe in herpes sero-
negative patients, especially at higher viral doses.
Injection site erythema was also commonly reported
and tended to subside more quickly in seropositive
patients.
In the multi-dose group, seronegative patients were
given an initial dose of 106 PFU /mL 3 weeks before
escalation to higher viral concentrations up to 108 PFU/
mL, which was then repeated every two weeks [7].
Approximately one third of patients were seronegative
for HSV with all seroconverting 3 to 4 weeks after the
first dose. The seropositive patients also had slight in-
creases noted in antibody titer levels [7]. To date, there
has been no correlation between antibody titters and
therapeutic responses or emergence of adverse events.
Using a lower starting concentration of virus, the pro-
nounced injection site reactions seen in seronegative
patients were avoided even when they were subse-
quently administered higher viral concentrations. No
dose-limiting toxicities were observed when the initial
dose was 106 PFU/ml. This was, thus, selected as the
starting dose, and followed 3 weeks later by a higher
dose of 108 PFU/ml in continued two week intervals
until maximum clinical response, toxicity or confirmed
disease progression. This regimen, designed to reduce in-
jection site reactions and flu-like side effects particularly
Rehman et al. Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer  (2016) 4:53 
Page 2 of 8
 in seronegative patients, became the standard dosing
schedule for subsequent clinical development.
Biological activity was assessed clinically and through
mechanistic correlatives including viral replication and
necrosis at the injection site, GM-CSF expression, cyto-
kine and antinuclear antibody levels [7]. No complete
or partial responses occurred according to standard
clinical response criteria. However, injected lesions and
nearby
lesions
demonstrated
flattening
by
clinical
examination [7]. Histological examination of biopsies
taken following injection showed inflammation and
necrosis in 14 out of 19 biopsies where tumor was
detected. In contrast, non-tumor cells within the tumor
microenvironment showed no evidence of necrosis,
thus supporting the tumor specificity of viral infection.
Furthermore, areas of necrosis strongly stained for HSV
proteins, while non-tumor tissue rarely stained positively
for virus [7]. Baseline serostatus did not negatively impact
cell necrosis following T-VEC administration.
Based on the biologic activity that was seen in the
Phase I study, a Phase II trial was conducted in 50
patients with stage III and IV melanoma that was not
amenable to surgery [8]. Patients received a median of
six T-VEC injection cycles. In this study, 85 % patients
experienced adverse effects, which were most com-
monly mild to moderate flu-like symptoms [8]. The
overall response rate by Response Evaluation Criteria in
Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria was 26 %, with 8
patients achieving a complete response and 5 patients
achieving a partial response. Notably, responses were
seen in injected, uninjected skin and soft tissue sites
and in visceral lesions. The responses observed were
durable, as 92 % of the responses were maintained for 7
to 31 months [8]. The 1-year survival rate was 58 % in
all intention-to-treat patients and 93 % in patients who
demonstrated an initial objective response to T-VEC.
Evidence of anti-tumor immunity was seen in a patient
who achieved a complete response and was found to
have increased local and systemic MART-1-specific
CD8+ effector T cells following treatment [9]. The
frequency of CD4 + Foxp3+ regulatory T cells and
myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) was lower in
tumor samples from T-VEC- treated patients compared
with tumor from non-treated melanoma patients. Within
the same patient, injected tumors had fewer regulatory
T cells than uninjected tumors [9].
A randomized phase III study known as the OPTiM
trial became the first study of an oncolytic virus to
demonstrate a statistically significant clinical benefit for
the treatment of melanoma [10]. In this open-label
study, T-VEC was compared with recombinant GM-CSF
in patients with unresectable stages IIIB, IIIC, and IV
melanoma. Patients were assigned in a 2:1 randomization
to receive intratumoral T-VEC (106 PFU/mL followed
3 weeks later by 108 PFU/mL every two weeks) or
subcutaneous recombinant GM-CSF (125 μg daily for
14 days in a 28 day cycle). The primary endpoint was
durable response rate (DRR), defined as a an objective
response
as
measured
by
modified
World
Health
Organization (WHO) criteria occurring within the first
12 months of therapy and lasting at least 6 months.
Secondary endpoints included progression-free and over-
all survival, objective response rate (ORR) by independent
committee assessment, and duration of response.
Of the 436 patients enrolled, 43 % had stage IV M1b/
c disease and 53 % had received prior systemic therapy.
Analysis of efficacy demonstrated that DRR was signifi-
cantly higher in the T-VEC arm compared with the
GM-CSF arm (16.3 % versus 2.1 %, p < .001). ORR was
also higher in the T-VEC arm (26 %) compared with
the GM-CSF arm (5.7 %). A response in 15 % of vis-
ceral metastases (all uninjected) was observed,. Median
time to treatment failure (TTF) was prolonged in the
T-VEC versus GM-CSF arm (8.2 versus 2.9 months).
Overall median survival was 23.3 months in the T-VEC
arm compared with 18.9 months in the control arm,
which approached but did not cross the significance
threshold (hazard ratio 0.79, p = .051).
T-VEC therapy in OPTiM was associated with an
excellent safety profile. Similar to the experience in the
earlier studies, the most common adverse events were
pyrexia, chills, flu-like symptoms, injection site reactions,
and fatigue. Serious treatment-related side effects were
rare. The only grade 3 or 4 adverse event that occurred in
more than 2 % of patients was cellulitis, which occurred
in 2.1 % of T-VEC treated patients. There were no
treatment-related deaths.
Based on the results of these studies, T-VEC garnered
approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) in October 2015 for the local treatment of unre-
sectable lesions in patients who have recurrent melan-
oma after initial surgery with cutaneous, subcutaneous,
or nodal lesions [11, 12]. This was followed by approval
by the European Medicine Agency (EMA) with T-VEC
approved for the treatment of patients with stage III
unresectable or IVM1a melanoma citing the significant
overall survival benefit seen in this subset of patients
on analysis of the data. Regulatory approval in Australia
quickly followed.
Integration of T-VEC into melanoma treatment
The approval of T-VEC comes at a time of major transi-
tion in the treatment of metastatic melanoma. Advances
in targeted BRAF and MEK in patients whose melan-
oma harbor mutations in BRAF and the emergence of
T cell checkpoint inhibitors alone and in combination
have revolutionized the therapeutic approach to ad-
vanced melanoma. While response rates are high with
Rehman et al. Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer  (2016) 4:53 
Page 3 of 8
 BRAF/MEK inhibitors, these agents are only useful in
patients who have BRAF mutations and most patients
will eventually develop drug resistance. The T cell check-
point inhibitors have been associated with response rates
of 11–15 % for CTLA-4 blockade and 30–40 % for PD-1
inhibitors with many patients achieving long-term benefit
[13–15]. Response rates are higher with combination ipili-
mumab and nivolumab but treatment is often associated
with significant adverse events and some patients are
not able to tolerate treatment. Further, patients may
present with recurrent locoregional disease in which
further surgical management may not be considered
curative, yet patients may not necessarily require poten-
tially toxic systemic therapy. Thus, there are several
clinical scenarios in which T-VEC may be considered.
Although improvement in overall survival in OPTiM
did not cross the threshold for statistical significance, a
subgroup of patients without visceral metastases did
appear to derive significant benefit. In patients with
stage IIIB, IIIC or IV M1a disease overall survival was
significantly improved (hazard ratio 0.57, p < .001). The
durable response rate in Stage IIIB/C patients was also
considerably higher at 33.0 % (95 % CI, 19.1–43.9 %). An
analysis of injected, uninjected non-visceral, and unin-
jected visceral lesions on a subset of patients from the
Phase II trial illustrates the relative potency of the local
and systemic effects of T-VEC [16]. Injected tumors were
more likely to respond and responded more quickly com-
pared with uninjected visceral metastases. Among lesions
directly injected with T-VEC, 86/128 (67.2 %) responded
(defined as a decrease in size by ≥ 30 %), including 59/128
(46.1 %), which completely resolved. Among uninjected
non-visceral lesions, 60/146 (41.1 %) responded, including
44/146 (30.1 %), which completely resolved. While the re-
sponse rate in injected and uninjected non-visceral lesions
was very high, the response rate in visceral lesions was
poor. Four out of 32 (12.5 %) responded, with only 3/32
(9.4 %) complete responses. The median time to response
in injected tumors versus non-visceral uninjected tumors
versus visceral uninjected tumors was 18.4 versus 23.1
versus 51.3 weeks, respectively [16]. These data suggest
that T-VEC is quite effective at controlling local disease,
but the systemic effects are weak and may require com-
bination approaches.
In our clinical practice, we consider T-VEC in several
situations. Patients who present with accessible lesions
for injection can all be potential T-VEC candidates. In
patients who have already failed other treatment regi-
mens, elderly patients or those with significant auto-
immune or other co-morbid conditions, the presence of
injectable lesions leads to a discussion of T-VEC. Patients
with minimal visceral disease may also be treated with T-
VEC first and then proceeds with systemic therapy using
T cell checkpoint inhibitors if T-VEC does not induce
tumor regression. Patients with visible head and neck
lesions are also good candidates for T-VEC since even
localized tumor regression can lead to cosmetic improve-
ment and reduce psychological stress.
Although no molecular biomarkers are known to im-
prove patient selection for T-VEC therapy, the ana-
tomic distribution of metastases is informative and
predicts the chance of response [16]. Thus, T-VEC ther-
apy can be considered for first-line therapy patients
with unresectable Stage III or IV M1a disease, or in
patients with relative contraindications to checkpoint
inhibition, such as those with significant autoimmune
disease, older age, poor performance and those who
have a history of significant adverse events with other
therapeutic agents.
A limiting factor to the widespread adoption of T-VEC
is that not all patients have injectable disease. As melan-
oma has a propensity to form subcutaneous, nodal and
dermal metastases, many patients will have injectable
disease at some point in their treatment course. It is
difficult to estimate what proportion of patients with
surgically refractory disease will have tumors that are
amenable to intratumoral injection in the clinic. Most
clinical trials do not report this specifically, but as a sur-
rogate, approximately 11 % of patients with unresectable
disease are Stage III or Stage IV M1a [17]. This is likely
an underestimate because additional patients who are
categorized as Stage IV M1b/c with injectable disease.
Another consideration may be logistical barriers at
the institutional or physician level to adopting new
technology. Medical oncologist may be concerned that
measuring and injecting tumors is more time-consuming
and the biosafety precautions required may be considered
too cumbersome to implement in busy clinics. A variety
of medical personnel are administering T-VEC injections,
including medical oncologists, surgical oncologists, der-
matologists, and nurses. Administration by nurses or
other healthcare professionals can lessen the hands-on
time required by physicians, as is typically done with ad-
ministration of IV therapies. While there is no formal
training that is required, clinical sites should follow their
standard operating procedures for drug handling and
administration. Immunocompromised and pregnant pro-
viders should not have direct contact with storage, hand-
ling, or administering T-VEC, nor should they come into
contact with the injection site [18].
There are a few contraindications to T-VEC therapy
for which patients should be screened. T-VEC is con-
traindicated in patients who have a clinical or labora-
tory evidence of an active herpetic infection and in
patients who require daily antiviral therapy such as
acyclovir [18]. Since T-VEC is a live, attenuated virus,
patients with a compromised immune status may be at
risk for a life-threatening disseminated herpetic infection.
Rehman et al. Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer  (2016) 4:53

 Therefore, T-VEC should be avoided in severely im-
munocompromised patients, including those with HIV,
leukemia, lymphoma, or patients on high-dose im-
munosuppressive therapy. There have been no studies
conducted in pregnant women or children, making the
use of T-VEC in this population unreasonable. Animal
studies were conducted, and no effects on embryo-fetal
development were noted in immunocompetent mice [18].
Clinical administration of T-VEC
T-VEC is classified as a biosafety level 1 agent, meaning
that it is not known to consistently cause disease in
healthy adult humans. Many centers opt to use biosafety
level 2 procedures as an added handling precaution [18].
T-VEC is prepared in a sterile biosafety cabinet by
thawing frozen vials, stored at −70 °C or colder, at room
temperature until conversion to liquid form. The start-
ing concentration is 106 PFU/ml (yellow-green vials) and
is given initially to allow all patients to seroconvert.
After three weeks, all subsequent injections utilize the
higher concentration of 108 PFU/ml (blue vials), which
is repeated every two weeks until confirmed disease pro-
gression or unacceptable toxicity. Thawed virus can be
refrigerated for 12 or 48 h depending on the concentra-
tion (106 for the former, 108 for the latter). However,
vials should not be refrozen. [18]. Transport also re-
quires maintaining this temperature. Caution should also
be made to avoid any light exposure to the preparation
during storage and thawing. When working with T-VEC,
universal precautions should be followed. These basic
principles include wearing protective clothing, includ-
ing a gown or lab coat, gloves, and face protection [18].
If accidental exposure transpires, the area should be
cleaned with water for at least 15 min. In the event of a
spill, 10 % bleach solution and absorbent materials
should be used to clean the area, as this has been
shown to neutralize the virus after 20 min of contact
[18]. A brief education of the safe handling, preparation
and administration of T-VEC for healthcare providers
can be very helpful.
The cutaneous, subcutaneous, and nodal lesions should
be visible, palpable, or detectable by ultrasound guid-
ance. On the day of injection, all injectable tumors
should be measured clinically using calipers or a ruler
and recorded on a tumor assessment worksheet, which
can be annotated with a sketch of the location of the le-
sions on the body or photographs. It is advisable to use
consistent numbering of lesions throughout the course
of treatment to minimize dosing errors. The longest
diameter of each lesion is used to determine the volume
of T-VEC to be administered, up to a maximum of 4 ml
per visit (see Table 1). In the case of multiple or large
tumors, it may not be possible to inject all the tumors
at each visit due to the maximum dose of 4 mL. It is
generally recommended to prioritize the largest lesions
first, then consider any new lesions, and then any
symptomatic lesions. [18]. It is ideal to prepare one
syringe for each lesion. In our center, we usually start
with the largest lesion, and if this responds, we move
on to smaller lesions. If a new lesion appears during
treatment, this lesion is the priority. If there is a prob-
lematic lesion)i.e. painful, visible location, etc.) this
lesion may be included in the injected tumors. A total
of 4 ml is allowed and as many lesions as possible are
injected up to 4 ml total volume at any one time. If
there is a confluence of lesions, we consider the total
area in the calculation of volume, and photographs can
be helpful for monitoring such collections of lesions. In
general, we prefer cutaneous lesions when present since
these are often easier to access than nodal disease but
clinically palpable or ultrasound imaged lymph nodes
may also be injected.
Premedications, including local anesthetics, are not
required, but may be used if a patient has previously
experienced significant pain during the injections. Before
injecting, the lesion in addition to the surrounding area
should be cleaned with an alcohol swab and allowed to
dry. T-VEC can then be injected into the lesion using
the four quadrant or fan technique (see Fig. 1). A single
insertion point is advised for most lesions, but multiple
insertion points may be required for large, flat lesions.
The needle can be slowly pulled back and redirected into
multiple areas to ensure even and complete dispersion.
The same preparation is required if other lesions are to
be injected with the exception that a new needle is
needed. If a lesion cannot be clearly palpated, ultrasound
can be used to better identify the lesion and visualize the
needle insertion at the time of injection.
After all lesions have been treated, pressure should be
applied to the injected area for 30 s. The injected site is
covered with gauze and occlusive dressing. All materials
in contact with T-VEC should be discarded as outlined
with universal precautions, including vials, syringes,
gauze, and dressings [18]. Clinic rooms in which T-VEC
was administered should be terminally cleaned with
10 % bleach-containing solution after all patients are
treated. The injection site should remain covered for
one week after each treatment visit. If the dressing falls

 off, patients should be instructed to re-dress the site.
Patients should be instructed to place all soiled ban-
dages and dressings into a sealed plastic bag, which can
be disposed of in the household waste.
Patients can continue to be treated until they develop
intolerance, confirmed progressive disease or complete
response. Responses may be delayed or include pro-
gression of disease before regression. Median time to
response in OPTiM was approximately 4 months [10].
Thus, clinical judgment is needed before stopping ther-
apy. Qualitative responses such as flattening, softening,
and eschar formation indicate biologic activity and can
precede quantitative objective responses in lesion size.
A biopsy may be necessary to confirm lesions that are
clinically thought to have resolved completely. Residual
melanophages at the site may result in persistent pig-
mentation in the absence of viable tumor.
Management of adverse events
Acetaminophen or indomethacin can be used for the pre-
vention and treatment of pain, fever or chills. Meperidine
may be given for rigors following injections, although this
is rarely necessary. Patients with hypophysitis or are taking
low dose corticosteroids (prednisone 10 mg or less daily
or equivalent) are candidates for T-VEC. These patients
should be instructed that they should take extra cortico-
steroids if they develop a fever or flu-like symptoms to
address relative adrenal insufficiency. Coordination and
communication with the patient’s endocrinologist may be
helpful.

complete dispersion. Inject within the lesion by pulling the needle back without exiting the lesion. Redirect the needle as many times as necessary in
the shape of a fan while injecting the remainder of the dose of TVEC. Continue until full administration of vial. b Four quadrant technique. Mark the
lesion in four different quadrants 2–3 mm apart. Enter one of the marked areas with the needle and inject virus. Exit the quadrant and move on to
different area and repeat in all four quadrants until complete administration of dose. c Clustered dermal metastases. When lesions are clustered
together, they can be measured and injected as a single lesion. d Ultrasound. Ultrasound assistance can be used for lesions that are difficult to identify

 To ease pain at the injection site, ice bags may be ap-
plied to the area for 5–10 min prior to injection. Oral or
IV analgesics are rarely required as pre-medications.
Dermal metastases tend to be the most painful due to the
rich nerve endings in the dermis, while subcutaneous
nodules and lymph nodes are often injected with little dis-
comfort. Topical anesthetic such as 1 % lidocaine may be
used, but care must be taken to inject that around the
periphery of the tumor (not directly in the tumor) in order
to prevent altered pH affecting the stability of T-VEC.
Injection site reaction, erythema, and cellulitis are
common, and based on results from the OPTiM study
are anticipated to occur in 27.7 %, 5.1 % and 5.8 %, re-
spectively. Acetaminophen or indomethacin can be used
for pain, erythema, and swelling. Cellulitis is a clinical
diagnosis, and it is possible that local erythema and pain
is due to herpes cellulitis, not superimposed bacterial
infection. Herpes cellulitis from T-VEC is typically self-
limiting and clears within 24–48 h whereas persistent
cellulitis or associated fever and leukocytosis suggest
that bacterial causes should be considered. In these
cases, patients should be cultured and antibiotics started.
For those with symptomatic cellulitis and other risk
factors, such as diabetes mellitus, empiric treatment with
antibiotics to cover for the possibility of bacterial cellu-
litis should be considered early.
If viremia or encephalitis is suspected, standard clinical
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for HSV DNA is
reliable in blood and cerebrospinal fluid. These PCR
probes target epitopes in the HSV-1 and HSV-2 gen-
ome that have not been modified in T-VEC, including
glycoproteins, HSV DNA polymerase, or HSV thymidine
kinase, which are all present and unmodified in T-VEC
[19]. If a clinically significant disseminated herpetic infec-
tion occurs, treatment with acyclovir is recommended, as
T-VEC is susceptible to antiviral therapy [20].
Accidental exposure is infrequent, but remains a con-
cern. Four incidents of accidental exposure in health-
care workers have been reported to date out of over
4,000 treatment visits [21]. Patients and healthcare
workers should continuously monitor themselves for
clinical signs of a herpetic outbreak. Isolated incidents
have occurred. Viral genomic testing determined that
the herpetic infection was related to the wild-type
strain, not the genetically modified product. These inci-
dents should be reported if they occur in the patient or
any contacts, including healthcare workers. Acyclovir
or other anti-viral medication is indicated in the event
of accidental exposure to T-VEC.
Future directions
As T-VEC has a tolerable safety profile, is highly effective
in injected lesions and promotes anti-tumor immunity, it
is tempting to combine it with complementary systemic
approaches to promote systemic immunity and treat-
ment of distant, uninjected lesions. T-VEC may support
immunotherapy by enhanced by IFNγ and TNFα pro-
duction, which can increase PD-L1 expression, promote
influx of effector CD8+ T cell to the tumor microenvir-
onment and decrease the number of CD4 + FoxP3+
regulatory T cells [22]. Trials are underway exploring
combinations with other immunotherapies, such as
ipilimumab and pembrolizumab [23, 24]. In a phase I
clinical trial of T-VEC and ipilimumab there were no
unexpected adverse events reported and an objective
response rate of 50 % was seen with 44 % of the pa-
tients experiencing durable responses lasting 6 months
or greater [24]. T-VEC is also being studied in combin-
ation with chemoradiation therapy. A phase I/II dose-
finding study of T-VEC in locally advanced squamous
cell cancer of the head and neck (SCCHN) was con-
ducted to define recommended dosage and interactions
with chemoradiation [25]. Patients received chemoradi-
ation therapy plus T-VEC every three weeks for a total
of four doses. There were no delays to chemoradiation
therapy or dose-limiting toxicities. At a median follow-up
of 29 months, locoregional control was 100 %, disease-
specific survival was 82 %, and relapse-free survival was
76 % [25].
Other important future studies with T-VEC will
include evaluation of T-VEC injections directly into
visceral tumors and neoadjuvant administration to
prevent tumor recurrence following surgical resection.
In addition, T-VEC will be evaluated in other tumors
with studies planned in non-melanoma skin cancers, soft
tissue sarcomas, rectal cancer, pancreatic cancer and
others. Additional investigations into the mechanisms of
anti-tumor activity, induction of host anti-tumor immun-
ity and identification of predictive biomarkers will also be
of major importance.
Conclusions
T-VEC represents the first oncolytic virus, a new class
of drugs that mediate anti-tumor activity by directly
killing tumor cells and secondarily inducing systemic
tumor-specific immunity. T-VEC is now approved for
the treatment of melanoma after demonstrating clinical
benefit in a randomized phase III clinical trial and is
associated with a tolerable safety profile, consisting of
mild constitutional symptoms and local injection site
reactions. The integration of T-VEC into the clinic is
associated with the need for healthcare provider educa-
tion, universal precautions, special storage and handling
procedures and comfort with local injections. T-VEC
can be considered in patients with accessible lesions for
injection by clinical palpation or ultrasound guided in-
jection and is especially useful for older patients, those
with contraindications to other melanoma therapy and

 those that need rapid locoregional control and are not
surgical candidates. Further studies of T-VEC combina-
tions, most notably with T cell checkpoint inhibitors,
will be especially interesting. T-VEC is another immu-
notherapeutic strategy available for the treatment of
advanced melanoma.
