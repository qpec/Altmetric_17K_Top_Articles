Abstract
Background: Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and sepsis are now frequently identified by
observations of vital signs and detection of organ failure during triage in the emergency room. However, there is
less focus on the effect on patient outcome with better observation and treatment at the ward level.
Methods: This was a before-and-after intervention study in one emergency and community hospital within the
Mid-Norway Sepsis Study catchment area. All patients with confirmed bloodstream infection have been
prospectively registered continuously since 1994. Severity of sepsis, observation frequency of vital signs, treatment
data, length of stay (LOS) in high dependency and intensive care units, and mortality were retrospectively
registered from the patients’ medical journals.
Results: The post-intervention group (n = 409) were observed better and had higher odds of surviving
30 days (OR 2.7, 95 % CI 1.6, 4.6), lower probability of developing severe organ failure (0.7, 95 % CI 0.4, 0.9),
and on average, 3.7 days (95 % CI 1.5, 5.9 days) shorter LOS than the pre-intervention group (n = 472).
Conclusions: In a cohort with stable mortality rates, early sepsis recognition by ward nurses may have
reduced progression of disease and improved survival for patients in hospital with sepsis.

Background
The Surviving Sepsis Campaign was launched in 2004 as a
global initiative to improve survival and reduce the mor-
bidity associated with sepsis [1–3]. Rapid response sys-
tems and development of care bundles have been central
to the initiative [4]. However, triggering of evidence-based
treatment systems requires recognition of sepsis and the
initiation of a treatment response as early as possible [5].
For the last two decades, sepsis has been defined as sus-
pected or evident infection accompanied by at least two
signs of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS)
[6]. Observations of patients with suspected infection, in-
cluding vital signs and organ function, have been insuffi-
ciently monitored for development of sepsis, especially at
ward level [5]. Ward nurses, who are at the bedside of pa-
tients in hospital, are in a key position to identify early-
stage sepsis and development of organ failure, yet they
have not been central to the sepsis campaign [7]. It is not
known how a systematic continuation of observations of
SIRS and organ failure in hospitalized patients with sus-
pected or confirmed infection will impact the outcomes of
patients with sepsis. Within the Mid-Norway Sepsis Study,
the rich data source on observations, treatment and out-
come in patients with confirmed bloodstream infection
(BSI) makes it possible to assess the potential effects of
such improvements in the treatment chain.
The aim was to investigate whether implementation of
a clinical tool for triage of SIRS and organ failure at the
ward, an alert and treatment flow chart, reinforced by
training, could improve clinical observations, lead to
fewer patients developing severe sepsis, and thus im-
prove in-hospital survival among patients with BSI.

 Methods
Study population
Since 1994 the Mid-Norway Sepsis Study has continu-
ously prospectively registered patients with confirmed
BSI identified by growth of one or more microbes from
blood
culture,
combined
with
clinical
evidence
of
systemic infection [8]. A new occurrence of BSI was re-
corded for patients if at least 30 days had passed since a
previous incident [9]. Clinical information from the pa-
tients’ records was recorded retrospectively, after stan-
dardized definitions, by a team of trained health care
professionals for all patients admitted before 2014 [8].
Intervention
The intervention was implemented from January to
October 2011 in one emergency community hospital,
serving around 90,000 citizens, in the Mid-Norway
Sepsis Study catchment area. The hospital has 124 beds,
approximately 15,700 admissions annually, and has 6
beds in the intensive care unit (ICU) and 5 in the high
dependency unit (HDU), equivalent to 12.6 ICU and
HDU beds/100,000 citizens. The mean patient load
across all staff-registered nurses who are involved in bed-
side work is 0.24 [10]. The hospital does not have a formal
Critical Care Outreach service, but there is daily dialog be-
tween the ward physician and the ICU doctors to discuss
patients in possible need of transfer to the ICU/HDU.
Acute transfers are handled by the ICU doctor on call.
The intervention was a bundle that included a flow chart
for sepsis identification, treatment and physician response
time (see Additional file 1), a SIRS and organ failure triage
(SOF-Triage) (Fig. 1) that was used on the wards to re-
evaluate for sepsis if clinically indicated. The new flow
chart instructed the ward nurse in charge of the sepsis pa-
tient to call the ICU doctor on call directly if the ward
physician was occupied and prevented from applying
within the time limits of the SOF-Triage. Additionally, the
bundle included information to all physicians and a new
four-hour training course for all nurses and nursing stu-
dents working on the wards (medical, surgical and
gynecological). The training included the pathophysiology,
early signs, and treatment of sepsis. The latter included

suspected infection, and clinical indication for monitoring. GCS Glasgow coma scale

 the importance of prompt intravenous (i.v.) fluids and
appropriate antibiotics, training in the SOF-Triage, and
objective communication about the patients’ status based
on observation of vital signs. Six extra training sessions
(on the background of the project, interpretation of blood
gas analysis, use of the SOF-Triage and flow chart) was
given to twelve expert nurses (at least one nurse in each
ward),
who
assisted
in
the
implementation
of
the
intervention.
The pre-intervention group included patients with
confirmed BSI in the period from January 2008 to
December 2010 as this period had guidelines that man-
dated equal vigilance towards observation of vital signs
as the intervention group (respiratory frequency, heart
rate, and temperature should be observed at least every
4 hours per first 24 hours in patients with suspected
sepsis). The post-intervention group consisted of pa-
tients with BSI admitted after implementation of the
intervention, i.e., from Nov. 2011 to Dec. 2013.
Data collection
The
variables
were
categorized
as
follows:
the
observation-rate of each vital sign the first 24 hours after
drawing a blood culture (temperature, respiratory fre-
quency or heart rate) was graded as poor (0 or 1 re-
corded observation), some (2–4 recorded observations)
or good observation (≥5 recorded observations); sepsis
at admission as BSI without signs of SIRS, sepsis, severe
sepsis, or septic shock [6]; sepsis-related Sequential
Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA score) [11] at baseline
and during follow up was dichotomized as non-severe or
severe organ failure (corresponding to infection-related
SOFA score >2 in any organ) [8]; infection focus as
lungs, urinary tract, and other origin; BSI-type as gram-
negative,
gram-positive,
and
mixed
microbial
BSI
(Additional file 2); length of stay (LOS) in the HDU and
ICU and survival were counted in days, 0–24 hours was
coded as 1 day, >24–48 hours as 2 days and so forth. All
patients were censored after 30 days of observation; age
(in years) at the time of positive blood culture was
treated as a continuous variable and as a categorical
variable
(<65
years,
65–79
years,
and
>80
years);
McCabe score was used to exclude patients with rapidly
fatal illness at admission (death expected within 1 month)
[12]; the Charlson weighted Comorbidity Index (CCI)
was classified as low (no underlying disease score),
medium (score 1–2), or high (score >2) [13]; place of ac-
quisition was categorized as hospital-acquired if a posi-
tive blood culture was drawn >48 hours after admission,
healthcare-associated (HCA) or community-acquired as
defined by Friedman et al. [14], with the exception that
HCA infection was defined for patients hospitalized for
≥2 days in the last 30 days (instead of the last 90) before
admission, as recommended by Schorr et al. [15];
functional status was categorized as independent if the
patient lived at home without any help from the com-
munity health service, partly independent if the patient
had some help from the community health service, e.g.,
with medication or wound care, and dependent if the
patient lived in a nursing home or lived at home with
help in most of the daily life activities [8]; appropriate
empiric antibiotic therapy was defined if (1) given intra-
venously in correct doses within 24 hours after the blood
culture and (2) active in vitro against the isolated mi-
crobe(s) [16]; intravenous fluid was documented as
amount in mL given during the first 24 hours after
diagnosis.
Statistical analysis
We excluded all patients with rapidly fatal illness from
the analysis. The t test for continuous variables, and χ2
test for categorical data were used to compare patient
baseline characteristics and nurses’ observation in pre-
intervention and post-intervention groups. The t test
was used to find the mean difference ± SD (95 % CI) be-
tween groups, and general linear models (GLM) to find
differences between groups adjusted for covariates in
four different models; unadjusted (model 1), age (con-
tinuous variable) and sex (model 2), model 2 plus func-
tional status and Charlson Comorbidity Index (model 3)
and model 3 plus dichotomized SOFA score (model 4).
The χ2 test was used to examine the proportions of pa-
tients who developed severe organ failure during the
hospital stay amongst patients admitted without a severe
SOFA score in pre-intervention and post-intervention
groups, and to examine the difference in the numbers of
patients who were deceased by 7 and 30 days. Logistic
regression analyses with the four previously described
models were used to calculate the odds ratios (ORs) and
95 % CIs for surviving 7 and 30 days after positive blood
culture (the pre-intervention group served as the refer-
ence group). In additional survival analysis, we examined
these variables added one by one to model 4: age cat-
egories, place of acquisition, use of immunosuppression,
and focus of infection.
In sensitivity analyses, all the above analyses were re-
peated restricted to first episodes of sepsis. Finally, we
investigated the potential effect of modifications by sex
and age (dichotomized at age 65 and age 80 years).

Results
Study population
A total of 478 BSI patients were admitted in the pre-
intervention period and 422 in the post-intervention
period. We excluded 19 patients with rapidly fatal ill-
ness, 6 (1.26 %) in the pre-intervention group and 13

 (3.1 %) in the post-intervention group (p = 0.001). Thus,
the pre-intervention group included 472 BSI episodes,
and the post-intervention group included 409 BSI epi-
sodes. The post-intervention group had a higher propor-
tion of patients with a severe SOFA score and the
patients were less in need of help in daily life than in the
pre-intervention group. For more details about the
groups see Table 1. The ratios of gram-negative, gram-
positive and mixed microbial BSI were similar in the two
groups as Table 1 shows.
Observation and treatment of the patients
The nurses in the post-intervention group increased
their observation frequency of all vital signs (see details

 in Fig. 2). The post-intervention group had better obser-
vations of all vital signs in both patients with and with-
out organ failure (p ≤0.002 for all vital signs).
The pre-intervention and post-intervention group had
the same probability of receiving appropriate antibiotics
within 24 hours (p = 0.89). The post-intervention group
received on average 429.6 mL (95 % CI 137.3, 722.0 mL)
more i.v. fluid during the first 24 hours after sepsis diag-
nosis in the GLM model 1. This difference was attenu-
ated after adjustment for dichotomized SOFA score in
model 3 (159.7 mL, 95 % CI-114.3, 433.8 MI). The mean
LOS in the HDU/ICU was 3.7 days (95 % CI 5.9,
1.5 days) shorter in the post-intervention group than in
the pre-intervention group in the full GLM adjustment
models (model 4).
Patient outcomes
In total 375 (79.4 %) of the pre-intervention group had a
non-severe SOFA score on admission compared to 277
(67.7 %) in the post-intervention group. During the hos-
pital stay, more patients in the pre-intervention group
had deterioration classified by SOFA score as severe
(21.3
%)
compared
to
the
post-intervention
group
(15.4 %) (p value = 0.025 for comparison of the two
groups). The OR (95 % CI) for deterioration of the
SOFA score in the post-intervention group was 0.6 (0.4,
0.9) when the pre-intervention group served as the
reference.
At 7 days after confirmed BSI, 22 patients (4.6 %) in
the pre-intervention group had died compared to 14
(3.4 %) patients in the post-intervention group (p = 0.36).
After
30
days
59
(12.5
%)
patients
in
the
pre-
intervention group had died versus 29 (7.1 %) patients in
the post-intervention group (p = 0.035). Table 2 displays
the ORs (95 % CIs) for surviving 7 and 30 days after BSI
diagnosis in the pre-intervention and post-intervention
groups in the different adjustment models.
In additional adjustment analyses for the variables im-
munosuppression, focus of infection, place of acquisi-
tion, and age in categories attenuated the impact of the
intervention from 2.7 towards 2.0 (95 % CI 1.2, 3.3), see
Additional file 3 for the details.
On sensitivity analyses for the first incidents of sepsis
(n = 738) there was a stronger effect on survival in the
post-intervention group than if all episodes of BSI (n = 881)
were included. The post-intervention group with the first
incidents of BSI had an OR of 2.4 (95 % CI 1.0, 5.3) for sur-
viving 7 days and an OR of 3.6 (95 % CI 1.9, 6.9) for surviv-
ing 30 days compared to the pre-intervention group. The
additional analyses for the first incidents of sepsis are
provided in Additional file 4 (baseline characteristics of
first-time incidents of BSIs) and Additional file 5 (odds of
surviving 7 and 30 days in the post-intervention group).
We found no evidence of interaction between survival and
age or sex in any of the analysis (p > 0.1 for all).
Discussion
In this pre-intervention and post-intervention study of
the implementation of a sepsis-specific triage, flow chart
alert and treatment system for inpatients, there was in-
creased 30-day survival, fewer patients deteriorating to
severe sepsis, and shorter LOS in the HDU/ICU in the
post-intervention group.

 The increased survival in the post-intervention group
is important as this has constantly been the primary goal
of the surviving sepsis campaign [6, 17, 18]. These
results must be interpreted with caution as in other co-
horts, as sepsis-related mortality has been reported to
decrease over time [19, 20] and may not be a result of
the intervention. However, there was stable mortality risk
Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae in
the period 1996–2011 for both 30-day and 90-day mortal-
ity in the same population as our cohort [21, 22]. De-
creased mortality in the post-intervention group is thus,
in our opinion, best understood as being related to the
intervention.
We may hypothesize that this effect was due to a com-
bination of several factors, with increased knowledge
amongst all staff, more rigorous protocols including
training in time-critical reporting of information across
health care professions, better adherence to sepsis bun-
dles,
higher
awareness
and
enhanced
performance
amongst all team members in our study, evidenced by
improved observation of patients by nurses [23–27].
Early recognition and prompt management has been hy-
pothesized to prevent patients with suspected infection
from progressing to life-threatening sepsis. However,
earlier research has focused on patients with severe sep-
sis and septic shock [28–30]. Our study is, to our best
knowledge, the first study that includes the effects of
more rigorous re-evaluation of hospital inpatients with
sepsis and confirmed BSI, and it confirms that fewer pa-
tients develop severe sepsis. Our SOF-Triage and flow
chart may thus be valuable tools to evaluate those inpa-
tients with suspected infection who do not meet the new
sepsis criteria [31].
We also found beneficial outcomes in the LOS in the
HDU/ICU. We do not believe that this is due to
organizational factors in the hospitals, as an emphasis to
keep the LOS as short as possible has been in place at
least since 2006 in Norway [32]. LOS in the HDU/ICU
indicates less need for advanced treatment, and may be
the result of more adequate treatment on the ward, less
delay in admission to the ICU/HDU, or both. There are
higher costs associated with caring for patients on ICU
and HDU than caring for ward patients [33], and thus,
an easy and affordable intervention as described in this
study will be cost-efficient in the long term. The study
shows how important it is from the perspective of the
safety of patients with BSI, to allocate resources for
bacteremia registries to evaluate (1) how the quality of
care impacts the morbidity and mortality of patients
with sepsis, and (2) evaluate the impact of patient identi-
fication and treatment flow charts.
The SIRS criteria that were launched in 1991 have been
under debate because of poor sensitivity and specificity for
sepsis [34, 35], and are not feasible for stand-alone diagno-
sis of sepsis. Hence, our SOF-Triage was developed based
on both SIRS and organ failure assessment, which also is
in line with the approach to sepsis in the sepsis guidelines
launched by The Third International Consensus Defini-
tions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3) [31]. In line
with suggestions from earlier literature, we designed it to
assist in the monitoring of sepsis development and also to
help nurses communicate in a precise language when re-
ferring patients to the physicians before severe organ fail-
ure develops [36, 37]. Adherence to observation and
treatment protocols seems to improve when followed up
with organized training and supervision [38], which was
confirmed
in
our
study.
The
nurses
in
the
post-
intervention period were better at monitoring all vital
signs, including observation of respiratory rate. In spite of
the importance of continuous observation of respiratory
rate to detect deterioration, this observation is often miss-
ing in nurse monitoring of patients [39].
The new quick SOFA (q-SOFA) criteria is a simple
and a promising tool for identifying patients at risk of
sepsis with life-threatening organ dysfunction [31]. It is
important to note that many patients in our study, who
were prevented from developing severe sepsis, would
not have been recognized by the q-SOFA criteria. We
believe the SOF-Triage may be a complementary tool for
observing inpatients who are admitted with, or develop
an infection during the hospitalization. The new sepsis
consensus also stresses that the SIRS criteria remain use-
ful for the identification of infection, and the practi-
tioner’s clinical assessments should not lead to a deferral
of investigation or treatment of infection, on failure to
meet the required q-SOFA criteria or SOFA score [31].
Strength and limitations

departmental and cross-professional agreement and

 commitment. Further, all patients diagnosed with evi-
dent
bacteremia
were
included.
Nevertheless,
the
study has important limitations such as the use of a
historical pre-intervention group, which does not en-
sure comparability between pre-intervention and post-
intervention groups. In our analyses, we have also
controlled
for
all
known
differences
between
the
groups at baseline. However, as this was an observa-
tional
study
we
could
not
control
for
a
natural
decline in mortality over time.
The
study
included
patients
with
evident
bacteremia only. Thus, a considerable proportion of
patients with sepsis may have been left out, as posi-
tive blood culture is found in only 30–40 % of
patients with sepsis [31]. However, there is no rea-
son to believe that the proportion of confirmed BSIs
should be different in the pre-intervention and post-
intervention group.
Conclusion
A sepsis specific triage, flow chart alert and treatment
system for inpatients where the ward nurses are re-
sponsible for being in the forefront of sepsis diagno-
sis,
may
lead
to
increased
survival,
decreased
occurrence of severe sepsis/septic shock, and shorter
LOS in the ICU/HDU. Implementation of clinical
tools needs to be discussed within the professional
team and be supported by training to improve clinical
observations. Our study also contributes to the under-
standing of how infection among hospital inpatients,
who do not have a score ≥2 in q-SOFA, but still have
indications for clinical monitoring, should be followed
up on the wards. Thus, the importance of ongoing
sepsis registries and evaluation of innovations of flow
charts for observation and treatment of patients with
BSI is important.
Key messages
� Implementation and training in the use of a SIRS
and organ failure triage (SOF-Triage) together
with a patient flow chart improved the
observations of all vital signs in patients with and
without organ failure, and is believed to help
ward nurses in early identification of patients
with sepsis
� Early recognition and prompt management may
prevent patients with BSI from progressing to life-
threatening sepsis, reduce mean LOS in the HDU/
ICU and increase 30-day survival
� The SOF-Triage may identify hospital inpatients,
who are in need of close monitoring, even though
they do not yet have a score ≥2 in the new quick
SOFA.
