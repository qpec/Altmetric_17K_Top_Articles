Introduction
Despite major advances in treatment, atherosclerosis through its clin-
ical sequelae, heart attack and stroke, is the leading cause of death 
worldwide. Regression of atherosclerosis is a vital goal in the quest 
to reduce cardiovascular risk, given that virtually all people by their 
fourth decade of life have established arterial plaques, some of which 
may ultimately become the culprit lesions causing clinical events.
To better understand the process of atherosclerosis regres-
sion, we and our collaborators have developed a number of sur-
gical and non-surgical mouse models (1–4). In the surgical model, 
an APOE-deficient (Apoe–/–) C57BL/6 mouse aortic arch segment 
with atherosclerotic plaques is transplanted into the abdominal 
aorta of a WT C57BL/6 recipient mouse. This sudden and sus-
tained normalization of dyslipidemia leads to remarkably rapid 
decreases in both plaque size and the content of cells positive for 
the standard macrophage marker CD68 (5–8). Reductions in the 
same parameters have also been noted in other mouse models of 
atherosclerosis regression in which normalization of dyslipidemia 
was induced by non-surgical means (reviewed in ref. 9).
One influential classification of macrophages is based on the 
work of Siamon Gordon and Alberto Mantovani and their col-
leagues, who have broadly described M1 (classically activated) 
and M2 (alternatively activated) states (10, 11). In vitro, macro-
phages can polarize toward either the M1 or M2 state by treatment 
with IFN-γ and LPS, or IL-4 and IL-13, respectively. Notably, in 
regressing atherosclerotic plaques, we have observed that there is 
reduced expression of classical inflammatory genes characteristic 
of M1 macrophages, such as monocyte chemoattractant protein–1 
(MCP-1), TNF-α, and iNOS, coincident with increased expres-
sion of genes encoding markers of alternatively activated, tissue- 
remodeling M2 macrophages, such as arginase 1 (ARG1), mannose 
receptor (MR, also known as CD206), and IL-10 in CD68+ cells 
(2, 3, 5, 12, 13). Importantly, the enrichment of plaque CD68+ cells 
with markers of the M2 phenotype, though initially discovered in 
the transplant model (5, 12), has been subsequently found in sev-
eral different models of atherosclerosis regression (2–4), suggest-
ing this represents a signature of plaque regression.
The mechanisms by which the macrophage phenotype chang-
es from M1 to M2 in regressing plaques and whether this shift is 
Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease, and developing therapies to promote its regression is an important 
clinical goal. We previously established that atherosclerosis regression is characterized by an overall decrease in plaque 
macrophages and enrichment in markers of alternatively activated M2 macrophages. We have now investigated the 
origin and functional requirement for M2 macrophages in regression in normolipidemic mice that received transplants of 
atherosclerotic aortic segments. We compared plaque regression in WT normolipidemic recipients and those deficient in 
chemokine receptors necessary to recruit inflammatory Ly6Chi (Ccr2–/– or Cx3cr1–/–) or patrolling Ly6Clo (Ccr5–/–) monocytes. 
Atherosclerotic plaques transplanted into WT or Ccr5–/– recipients showed reduced macrophage content and increased 
M2 markers consistent with plaque regression, whereas plaques transplanted into Ccr2–/– or Cx3cr1–/– recipients lacked 
this regression signature. The requirement of recipient Ly6Chi monocyte recruitment was confirmed in cell trafficking 
studies. Fate-mapping and single-cell RNA sequencing studies also showed that M2-like macrophages were derived from 
newly recruited monocytes. Furthermore, we used recipient mice deficient in STAT6 to demonstrate a requirement for 
this critical component of M2 polarization in atherosclerosis regression. Collectively, these results suggest that continued 
recruitment of Ly6Chi inflammatory monocytes and their STAT6-dependent polarization to the M2 state are required for 
resolution of atherosclerotic inflammation and plaque regression.

all, these results indicate a previously unappreciated requirement 
for the recruitment of inflammatory Ly6Chi monocytes and their 
STAT6-dependent conversion to tissue-remodeling M2 macro-
phages in the regression of atherosclerosis.
Results
Deficiency of CCR2 or CX3CR1, but not CCR5, in aortic transplant 
recipients prevents plaque regression despite the reversal of dyslipidemia. 
At 4 weeks of age, Apoe–/– mice were fed a standard high-fat high 
cholesterol diet (“Western diet” [WD]) to exacerbate their hyper-
lipidemia so that they developed advanced atherosclerotic lesions 
by 16 weeks (baseline group). The aortic arches from these donor 
mice were then transplanted into Apoe–/–, WT, Ccr2–/–, Cx3cr1–/–, or 
Ccr5–/– mice maintained on a chow diet, as illustrated in the experi-
mental design in Figure 1A. In contrast to the hyperlipidemia of the 
Apoe–/– recipients, which led to atherosclerosis progression, the lipo-
protein profiles showed that the WT and chemokine receptor–defi-
cient mice were all normolipidemic, with total plasma cholesterol 
levels of ~90 mg/dl (vs. ~1,100 mg/dl in the Apoe–/– donors on WD 
and ~400 mg/dl in the Apoe–/– recipients on chow; data not shown).
As we previously reported (5, 6, 12, 24), plaque area as well as 
macrophage (CD68+ cells) and neutral lipid (i.e., staining positive 
for Oil Red O) content in aortic arches transplanted into the regres-
sion environment of the WT mice were significantly decreased 
to <50% of baseline by 5 days (Figure 1, B–E). Similarly, plaque, 
CD68+, and lipid areas decreased in the Ccr5–/– recipients to a level 
comparable to that observed in WT recipients (Figure 1, B–E), con-
sistent with regression of atherosclerosis. However, transfer of aor-
tic segments into Ccr2–/– or Cx3cr1–/– recipients did not lead to sig-
nificantly decreased plaque area or CD68+ cell content compared 
with baseline, despite plasma lipoprotein levels similar to those 
in WT recipients (Figure 1, B, C, and E). Furthermore, CCR2 or 
CX3CR1 deficiency in transplant recipients prevented the decrease 
in plaque neutral lipid content observed in the WT and Ccr5–/– recip-
ients (Figure 1, D and E). These results indicate that CCR2 and 
CX3CR1, which mediate the recruitment of Ly6Chi monocytes into 
progressing plaques (19, 25–27), are essential for the regression of 
atherosclerosis. Furthermore, although CCR5 contributes to ath-
erosclerosis progression by recruiting Ly6Clo monocytes (22), this 
chemokine receptor, and by extension recruitment of Ly6Clo mono-
cytes, is not required for atherosclerosis regression.
Deficiency of CCR2 or CX3CR1, but not CCR5, in transplant 
recipients prevents the accumulation of M2 macrophages in regress-
ing plaques. In various models of atherosclerosis regression, an 
enrichment of M2 macrophage markers accompanies the change 
in plaque content of CD68+ cells (2, 4, 5, 12). To determine whether 
the chemokine receptors CCR2, CX3CR1, and CCR5 contribute to 
the enrichment of M2 macrophages and the reduction of the M1 
inflammatory phenotype in regressing plaques, we transplant-
ed aortic segments into the recipient mouse groups as outlined 
in Figure 1A and examined the expression of the M1 macrophage 
marker MCP-1 and the M2 markers MR and ARG1 by immuno-
histochemical staining. As shown in Figure 2, A–C, the MR- and 
ARG1-positive areas were significantly increased, while MCP-1 
staining was decreased, in plaques transferred to normolipidemic 
WT (as expected) and Ccr5–/– recipient mice compared with those 
from Apoe–/– recipient mice. In contrast, the MCP-1+, MR+, and 
required for regression remain unknown. Based on one study of 
macrophage phenotypes during the progression of atherosclerosis 
in Apoe–/– mice — in which serial immunohistological examinations 
showed that plaque macrophages have M2 phenotypes at the early 
stages of the disease but become M1 macrophages as the lesions 
advance (14) — it is possible that M1 macrophages in the plaques 
retain plasticity and reclaim characteristics of the original M2 
phenotype in the regression environment. Alternatively, the M2 
 
macrophages may be derived through the proliferation of a pool 
of tissue-resident macrophages (15) that originated from the yolk 
sac, as has previously been demonstrated in other tissues (16). 
Finally, M2 macrophages in regressing plaques may be derived 
from newly recruited monocytes.
Based on our earlier studies showing continued recruitment of 
circulating monocytes into regressing plaques (17), we prioritized 
testing this third hypothesis. We focused on two key questions: (a) 
If newly recruited monocytes became M2 macrophages, which 
circulating monocyte subset provided the new cells? (b) Is the con-
version to the M2 phenotype required for plaque regression? 
There are two major subsets of murine monocytes, and they 
are traditionally defined by the expression of different chemok-
ine receptors: CCR2+CX3CR1+Ly6Chi and CCR2–CX3CR1++Ly6Clo 
monocytes. These subsets are characterized by distinct migratory 
and inflammatory properties (reviewed in ref. 16). The classical 
Ly6Chi monocytes efficiently infiltrate inflammatory sites, dom-
inating the acute inflammatory response to pathogens, as well 
as the monocytosis and recruitment into progressing plaques in 
Apoe–/– mice (18, 19). They employ both CCR2 and CX3CR1 to enter 
atherosclerotic lesions and are thought to become M1 macrophages 
in most inflammatory sites (19–21). Thus, Ly6Chi cells are often 
termed “inflammatory monocytes.” In contrast, the nonclassical 
monocytes (CCR2–CX3CR1++Ly6Clo) do not express CCR2, but do 
express the highest levels of CX3CR1 (21). These monocytes patrol 
blood vessels and also accumulate at inflammatory sites, where they 
are thought to give rise to M2 macrophages (21). Because the Ly6Clo 
monocytes do not express CCR2, other chemokine receptors must 
be responsible for their recruitment to atherosclerotic plaques. Sur-
prisingly, despite their high expression of CX3CR1, this chemokine 
receptor was dispensable for nonclassical monocyte recruitment, 
whereas CCR5 was not (19). Notably, the combined inhibition of 
CCR2, CX3CR1, and CCR5 essentially abolished atherosclerosis 
progression in hyperlipidemic mice, suggesting that recruitment of 
both subsets of circulating monocytes into plaques is required for 
their development (22).
To investigate the source of, and functional requirement for, M2 
macrophages in atherosclerosis regression, we employed the aortic 
transplantation model and used recipient mice lacking the major 
receptors required for Ly6Chi and Ly6Clo monocyte recruitment 
into developing plaques (e.g., CCR2 and CCR5, respectively). We 
show herein that recruitment of recipient CCR2-dependent Ly6Chi 
monocytes is essential for atherosclerosis regression and the con-
current reduction in plaque macrophage content and enrichment 
in M2 macrophages. Notably, enrichment in the M2 phenotype and 
reduction in macrophage content were both markedly attenuated 
in regressing plaques when the STAT6 signaling pathway, known 
to be downstream from the M2-polarizing cytokines IL-4/IL-13 
(23), was absent in recipient mouse circulating monocytes. Over-

(16), our findings are in agreement with recent reports that Ly6Chi 
inflammatory monocytes recruited to allergic skin, schistosome 
granulomas, or injured myocardium subsequently acquired the M2 
phenotype (20, 28–31).
Acute inhibition of CCR2 prevents plaque regression and sup-
presses enrichment in the M2 macrophage phenotype. CCR2 is crit-
ical for both egress of Ly6Chi monocytes from bone marrow and 
for their entry into progressing atherosclerotic plaques; indeed, 
Ccr2–/– mice have reduced numbers of circulating monocytes and, 
when crossed to mouse models of atherosclerosis, have smaller 
plaques (22, 25, 26). As the reduction of circulating monocytes in 
Ccr2–/– mice may confound the interpretation of the aortic trans-
plant experiments, we complemented this genetic approach with 
studies using a small molecule inhibitor of CCR2, which does not 
alter the total number of circulating monocytes or their subsets in 
ARG1+ areas did not change significantly in plaques transplanted 
into Ccr2–/– or Cx3cr1–/– recipient mice. Indeed, only a small pro-
portion of plaque CD68+ cells in the Ccr2–/– and Cx3cr1–/– recipi-
ents expressed MR or ARG1, while a significant majority of plaque 
CD68+ cells in WT and Ccr5–/– recipients were MR+ and ARG1+ (Fig-
ure 2, A–C). The results suggest that the recruitment of recipient 
monocytes through CCR2 and CX3CR1 is crucial not only for ath-
erosclerosis regression, but also for the accumulation of M2 mac-
rophages. These results, taken with the data in Figure 1, make the 
possibility that the conversion of M1 cells in the donor plaques is a 
significant source of M2 macrophages unlikely. Rather, they over-
whelmingly appear to be derived from active recruitment of recipi-
ent monocytes from the Ly6Chi subset. Although M2 macrophages 
have been proposed to arise from either the Ly6Clo subset (21) or 
from proliferation of tissue macrophages derived from the yolk sac

monocytes, we used two different labeling methods to track their 
recruitment into plaques. Using EdU (5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine) 
to specifically label Ly6Chi (32–34) circulating monocytes (design 
shown in Figure 4A, labeling efficiency shown in Figure 4, B and 
C), we observed a significant reduction (relative to WT recipients) 
in EdU-labeled monocytes in plaques transplanted into Ccr2–/–, 
but not Ccr5–/–, mice (Figure 4D). This confirms that deficiency of 
CCR2 in recipient mice resulted in decreased recruitment of Ly6Chi 
monocytes into plaques in a regression environment. Second, 
using fluorescent latex beads to specifically label circulating Ly6Clo 
(8, 17, 19) monocytes (Figure 4, E and F), we observed that rela-
tive to WT recipients, there was a reduction (P = 0.05) in bead- 
labeled cells in plaques transplanted into Ccr5–/–, but not Ccr2–/–, 
recipient mice (Figure 4G). There were no significant differences 
 
in macrophage proliferation or apoptosis between the plaques 
transplanted into WT, Ccr2–/–, and Ccr5–/– recipients, as measured 
by staining for Ki67 (Figure 4H) and cleaved caspase 3 (Figure 4I), 
short-term treatment (Figure 3, A and B). Notably, WT recipients 
treated with the CCR2 inhibitor for 48 hours before and 72 hours 
after the transplantation of aortic arches from Apoe–/– mice did not 
demonstrate lesion and CD68+ area reductions, in contrast to the 
WT recipients treated with vehicle (Figure 3, C and D). In addition, 
by immunostaining, CCR2 inhibition prevented the enrichment in 
the M2 marker MR and the decrease in the M1 marker MCP-1 that 
were observed in the WT-vehicle group (Figure 3E). These results 
not only are concordant with the consequences of the genetic 
deficiency of CCR2 (Figures 1 and 2), but also extend those data 
by showing that the role of CCR2 in atherosclerosis regression is 
independent of total circulating monocyte levels.
Assessment of monocyte trafficking shows Ly6Chi monocyte 
recruitment is key to impaired regression in Ccr2–/– mice. To extend 
the results with the inhibitor and to demonstrate that the impaired 
regression of plaques transplanted into Ccr2–/– recipient mice was 
specifically due to the reduced recruitment of the Ly6Chi subset of

~80% of the MR+ cells in the plaques in the WT recipient group 
were of CD45.2 (recipient-derived) origin. Overall, the data are 
consistent with the impaired regression in Ccr2–/– mice being due 
to less recruitment of recipient monocytes, and that the newly 
recruited monocytes become polarized overwhelmingly to the M2 
macrophage state.
Next, we transplanted aortic arches from Apoe–/– mice that 
were fed the WD for 16 weeks (baseline group) into CD68-GFP 
transgenic mice, a model recently introduced for tracking CD68+ 
monocyte–derived cells, including in atherosclerosis (outline 
in Figure 5E) (36, 37). After 5 days, the transplanted arches were 
excised and enzymatically digested to release cells from the 
plaques. Using surface marker labeling and flow cytometry, we 
measured the content of M2 macrophages by gating on CD45+CD-
11b+F4/80+MR+ cells. Notably, we found that 73.9% ± 6.5% (n = 
3) of the M2 macrophages in regressing plaques were CD68-GFP+ 
(representative analysis shown in Figure 5F), indicating that the 
majority of those macrophages originated from the recipient, and 
not donor, mice.
To extend these findings, we also isolated CD45+CD-
11b+F4/80+ macrophages from aortic arches from mice in baseline 
and regression groups subjected to aortic digestion and FACS. Sin-
gle macrophages were then captured in a Fluidigm C1 instrument 
for single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis. As outlined in 
Figure 5G, only newly recruited cells from the WT recipient mice 
will express Apoe mRNA, thus allowing us to use it as a marker for 
macrophage origin during regression. Compared with baseline, 
a large proportion of aortic macrophages from regressing plaque 
samples expressed both Apoe and Cd206 (encoding MR), as well 
as Apoe and Arg1 mRNAs (Figure 5H). This shows at a single-cell 
level that M2 macrophages in regressing plaques originate from 
newly recruited monocytes. Together, these data from three dif-
ferent approaches strongly support that there is recruitment of 
monocytes in transplant recipient mice and that they are the 
sources of the M2 macrophages in regressing plaques.
respectively. As plaques transplanted into Ccr5–/– recipient mice 
show regression similar to those in WT mice, despite the lack of 
recruitment Ly6Clo monocytes, this suggests that this monocyte 
population is not required for the promotion of atherosclerosis 
regression. Furthermore, the recruitment of Ly6Clo monocytes 
into plaques is intact in Ccr2–/– recipient mice, yet regression fails 
to occur, indicating that Ly6Clo monocyte–derived cells cannot 
replace Ly6Chi monocytes in promoting plaque regression.
M2 macrophages originate from newly recruited cells from recip-
ient mice. Though there is concurrent recruitment of recipient 
monocytes and enrichment in plaque CD68+ cells with macro-
phage M2 characteristics, this does not definitely establish a direct 
link between these two findings. To demonstrate, using multiple 
approaches, that recipient mouse monocytes are indeed the source 
of M2 macrophages in regressing plaques, the following experi-
ments were performed. First, we performed fate mapping studies 
using the pan-leukocyte marker CD45, which has two isoforms, 
CD45.1 and CD45.2; these can be distinguished from each other 
by monoclonal antibodies (outline in Figure 5A) (35). Starting at 
4 weeks of age, CD45.1 Apoe–/– mice were fed a WD for 14 weeks 
to induce the development of advanced atherosclerotic lesions 
(baseline group). The aortic arches were then transplanted into 
WT, Ccr2–/–, or Ccr5–/– mice on a CD45.2 background maintained 
on a chow diet. We omitted the Cx3cr1–/– group, because the previ-
ous results in Figures 1 and 2 were essentially the same as in Ccr2–/– 
mice or in mice treated with the CCR2 inhibitor.
Consistent with Figure 1, the plaques in aortic arches trans-
planted into Ccr2–/– mice showed impaired regression compared 
with those transplanted into WT and Ccr5–/– mice (data not shown). 
There was also a significant reduction in CD45.1+ donor-derived 
cells in plaques transplanted into WT and Ccr5–/–, but not Ccr2–/–, 
mice (Figure 5, B and C). Conversely, there was significant accu-
mulation of CD45.2+ newly recruited recipient-derived cells, com-
pared with baseline, in plaques transplanted into WT and Ccr5–/–, 
but not Ccr2–/–, mice (Figure 5, B and C). As shown in Figure 5D,

Deficiency of STAT6 in the monocytes of aortic transplant recip-
ients prevents the accumulation of M2 macrophages and impairs 
plaque regression. To determine whether the M2 enrichment in 
regressing plaques requires the classical IL-4/IL-13/STAT6 signal-
ing pathway (23) in the newly recruited recipient monocytes, we 
transplanted aortic arches from Apoe–/– mice into normolipidemic 
Stat6–/– recipient mice. Notably, our findings in Stat6–/– recipient 
mice recapitulate those in Ccr2–/– and Cx3cr1–/– recipient mice, 
as well as in mice that underwent acute CCR2 inhibition, in that 
plaques showed no significant decrease in lesion area, CD68+ 
content, or Oil Red O neutral lipid area (Figure 6, A–C, and E). 
Furthermore, lack of STAT6 in transplant recipients prevented

groups. Quantifications in D, G, H, and I were done in aortic arch plaques from mice 5 days after transplantation (n = 8–9 per group). #P = 0.05, *P < 0.05 when

Discussion
Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease that develops in 
the setting of hyperlipidemia, with progression a consequence of 
the failure to resolve inflammation (38). Using a number of mouse 
models of atherosclerosis regression, including the aortic arch 
transplant used in the present study, we have previously shown 
that aggressive lipid lowering promotes the resolution of plaque 
M2 macrophage marker enrichment in plaques despite their nor-
molipidemic environment (Figure 6, D and E). Isolation of plaque 
CD68+ cells by laser capture microdissection confirmed higher 
mRNA levels of the M1 marker Ccl2 (encoding MCP-1) and lower 
mRNA levels of the M2 markers Arg1 and Cd206 (encoding MR) in 
STAT6-deficient recipients compared with WT (Figure 6F). Nota-
bly, levels of Apoe mRNA, which, as noted above, is only expressed 
in newly recruited monocyte-derived macrophages from recipient 
mice, were not different in plaques transplanted into Stat6–/– and 
WT recipient mice, suggesting similar levels of monocyte recruit-
ment (Figure 6F). Thus, these data taken with the other results

Though many questions remain, the present results provide 
insights into the dynamic nature of the inflammatory process and 
the role of Ly6Chi monocytes in plaques. These cells were previ-
ously thought to contribute only to plaque progression and inflam-
mation, but are now shown here to be important in regression and 
inflammation resolution. One clinically relevant insight raised 
by our studies is that strategies that promote the accumulation of 
M2 macrophages in atherosclerotic lesions may be a promising 
approach toward promoting plaque regression, consistent with 
recent studies in mice in which treatment with IL-13– or IL-4–based 
therapy was protective against atherosclerosis progression (42, 43).
Methods
Animals and aortic transplantation. The aortic arch transplantation mod-
el has been described previously (5, 6, 8, 12, 17, 24). Briefly, a donor arch 
from an atherosclerotic mouse was interpositioned with the abdomi-
nal aorta in the recipient mouse, and blood flow was directed through 
the graft. The donor Apoe–/– (B6.129P2-Apoetm1Unc/J) mice, in either a 
CD45.1 (Apoe–/– crossed with B6.SJL-Ptprca Pepcb/BoyJ) or CD45.2 back-
ground, were weaned at 4 weeks onto a 21% fat, 0.3% cholesterol WD 
(Dyets Inc.) for 14–16 weeks. Mice were then divided into one group 
(pre-transplant) for baseline analyses and another group to be donors 
of aortic arch segments. The recipients were WT (C57BL/6), CD68-
GFP reporter (C57BL/6-Tg(CD68-EGFP)1Drg/J), Apoe–/–, Ccr2–/– 
 
(B6.129S4-Ccr2tm1Ifc/J), 
Cx3cr1–/– 
(B6.129P-Cx3cr1tm1Litt/J), 
Ccr5–/– 
(B6.129P2-Ccr5tm1Kuz/J), or Stat6–/– (B6.129S2(C)-Stat6tm1Gru/J) mice on 
a CD45.2 background (purchased from The Jackson Laboratory). All 
recipient mice were 20 weeks old and maintained on standard chow 
diet, and were sacrificed 3 or 5 days after transplantation. In some 
experiments, mice were administered an inhibitor of CCR2 (CCX417), 
which was provided by ChemoCentryx. 10 mg/ml stock of CCX417 
was used at a dose of 5 ml/kg subcutaneously once a day, as instructed 
by ChemoCentryx, and administered for 48 hours before and 72 hours 
after the transplantation.
Single-cell RNA-seq cell isolation and flow cytometry analysis. 
CD45+CD11b+F4/80+ macrophages were isolated using the BD 
FACS Aria IIu SORP from pre-transplant baseline and grafted 
arches from WT recipient mice (regression) that were removed after 
perfusion of cold PBS and enzymatic digestion as described in ref. 
44. Cell surface markers were labeled with the following antibod-
ies: CD45 PerCpCy5.5 (BioLegend, catalog 103132), CD11b AF700 
(BioLegend, catalog 101222), and F4/80 PeCy7 (BioLegend, cata-
log 123114). Single cells were captured and processed on a Fluidigm 
C1 instrument in collaboration with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals as 
described in ref. 45.
For analysis of cells isolated from grafted arches from CD68-GFP 
reporter mice, samples were processed as described above, and flow 
cytometry was conducted on a BD LSRII UV. Cell surface markers were 
labeled with CD45 PerCpCy5.5 (BioLegend, catalog 103132), CD11b 
BV650 (BioLegend, catalog 101259), F4/80 PeCy7 (BioLegend, catalog 
123114), and MR/CD206 APC (BioLegend, catalog 141712).
Single-cell RNA-seq analysis. Single-cell RNA-seq reads were mapped 
to the reference mouse genome (GRCm38), including multiple mapped 
reads, using ArrayStudio. Estimated counts of reads that mapped within 
each of 24,475 RefSeq genes, taking into account read-mapping uncer-
tainty, were obtained using the RNA-Seq by Expectation Maximization 
(RSEM) algorithm (46) in ArrayStudio (OmicSoft). We carried out all sub-
inflammation, which is characterized by a decreased content of 
macrophages and an increase in the level of markers of the M2 
state (2, 4, 5, 12). We now extend these findings to show that plaque 
regression and the attendant resolution of inflammation surpris-
ingly require the recruitment of new monocytes, which assume 
the characteristics of M2 macrophages. Furthermore, contrary to 
the prevailing paradigm (16), the newly recruited monocytes are 
drawn from the Ly6Chi circulating subset, generally considered to 
be “inflammation-prone” precursors of M1 macrophages.
These findings are based on a number of experimental 
approaches, which include aortic transplantation of atherosclerot-
ic aortae into recipient mice with normolipidemia and deficiencies 
of various chemokine receptors; monocyte/macrophage traffick-
ing methods; the administration of an inhibitor of CCR2-medi-
ated Ly6Chi monocyte recruitment; the differentiation of donor 
from recipient cells by CD45.1/45.2 fate mapping; determina-
tion of CD68-driven GFP expression; and single-cell RNA-seq 
of plaque macrophages. Together, these data provide a strong 
foundation for our major conclusion, namely that atherosclerosis 
regression after lipid lowering is dependent on the recruitment 
of Ly6Chi monocytes and their polarization toward the M2 phe-
notype. Furthermore, the data also strongly suggest that Ly6Clo 
monocyte–derived cells cannot replace the required Ly6Chi mono-
cytes in promoting plaque regression. While we have reported the 
enrichment in plaques of the M2 phenotype in a number of mouse 
models of atherosclerosis regression (2–4, 5, 12), we recognize that 
the present results are based on a specific aortic transplantation 
model. Whether they explain the M2 phenotypic enrichment more 
generally in other murine models of atherosclerosis regression or 
apply to the clinical setting will require additional investigation.
The characteristic rapid reversal of hyperlipidemia in mouse 
atherosclerosis regression models is likely to reduce the continuous 
stimulation of the plaque inflammatory response by atherogenic 
lipoproteins, but clearly is not sufficient for the resolution of inflam-
mation. Based on our results, M2 enrichment must also occur, and 
how the change in lipoprotein environment causes this to happen 
also remains to be determined. Our finding that it depends on 
STAT6-dependent signaling in the newly recruited monocytes sug-
gests that local factors in the regressing plaque stimulate this sig-
naling pathway. STAT6 is activated by two key cytokines, IL-4 and 
IL-13. However, which of these cytokines is the main player, as well 
as their cellular source(s), in promoting plaque regression is unclear.
A number of potential sources of these cytokines exist, includ-
ing Th2 lymphocytes, which can accumulate in plaques (39). Indeed, 
we have shown that adaptive CD4+ T cells are required for mainte-
nance of M2 macrophages during chronic helminth infection (40). 
Another possibility is suggested by the finding that during acute 
allergic skin inflammation, basophils are a source of the IL-4 that 
polarizes newly recruited Ly6Chi monocytes to M2 macrophages 
(28). Furthermore, eosinophils have been identified as a source of 
IL-4/IL-13 for M2 macrophage polarization in adipose tissue under 
steady-state conditions and during acute helminth infection, and 
invariant NKT (iNKT) cells provide IL-4 to promote monocyte 
differentiation to M2 macrophages in experimental autoimmune 
encephalomyelitis (EAE) (41). Which of these immune cell subtypes 
is important for M2 polarization signaling in atherosclerosis regres-
sion is being actively investigated by our laboratory.

catalog 9661S). ImagePro Plus 7.0 software (Media Cybernetics) was 
used to determine CD68+, MR+, ARG1+, and MCP-1+ areas. Fiji (52) was 
used to determine CD45.1+ and CD45.2+ areas as well as to identify Ki67+ 
and cleaved caspase 3+ cells in the plaques. CD68+ cells were selected 
from atherosclerotic plaques by laser capture microdissection as previ-
ously described (24). RT-PCR was performed using a 7300 Real-Time 
PCR System (Applied Biosystems) and primers listed in ref. 12.
Monocyte subset labeling. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with 1 
mg/mouse EdU (Life Technologies, catalog E10187) to label the Ly6Chi 
subset of monocytes. EdU incorporation into circulating monocytes 
was detecting using the Click-iT Plus EdU Pacific Blue Flow Cytome-
try Assay Kit (Life Technologies, catalog C10636) and in plaque tissue 
using the Click-iT Plus EdU Alexa Fluor 647 Imaging Kit (Life Technol-
ogies, catalog C10640). Mice were injected retro-orbitally with green 
fluorescent latex beads to label Ly6Clo monocytes. Their incorpora-
tion into circulating monocytes was detected and number of beads/
section assessed as described in refs. 8, 17, 19. Circulating monocytes 
were detected by flow cytometry using surface markers CD45 PE/Cy7 
(BioLegend, catalog 103114), CD115 PE (BioLegend, catalog 135506) or 
APC (BioLegend, catalog 135510), and Ly6C APC (BioLegend, catalog 
108412) or PerCP Cy5.5 (BD Bioscience, catalog 560525).
Statistics. Data are expressed as mean ± SEM. Data were typically 
analyzed by 1-way ANOVA (GraphPad Prism 7), with Dunnett’s multiple 
comparisons testing when there were 3 or more groups. Data involving 
comparisons between 2 groups were analyzed using unpaired t testing 
(GraphPad Prism 7). P ≤ 0.05 was considered significant.
Study approval. These studies were performed in strict accordance 
with the recommendations in the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of 
Laboratory Animals (National Academies Press, 2011). The Institu-
tional Animal Care and Use Committee of the New York University 
School of Medicine reviewed and approved the protocol.

sequent RNA-seq analysis steps in the R statistical computing environ-
ment (version 3.2.1; https:/
/www.r-project.org/). We excluded from fur-
ther analysis all genes for which the count did not exceed zero in at least 
two samples. For the remaining 16,294 genes, we rounded the expres-
sion counts to the nearest integer and then adjusted the count values on 
a per-sample basis using DESeq2 (http:/
/bioconductor.org/packages/
release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html) normalization, with size factors based 
on the sample-wise geometric means of the counts for genes with nonzero 
counts in each sample. We then quantile-normalized (47) the count data in 
order to adjust for batch effects. For the global unsupervised two-dimen-
sional visualization of the RNA-seq data, we transformed the normalized 
count matrix by adding one to each entry and then log2 transforming. We 
used multidimensional scaling (MDS) (48) with n = 2 dimensions (includ-
ing only genes for which the normalized count was 50 or greater in at least 
one sample) in order to obtain an unsupervised two-dimensional visual-
ization of the log2-transformed gene expression data on a sample-specific 
basis. We further eliminated any sample from downstream analysis if its 
sum of log2 counts was not at least 1,200. The above sample assignment 
and filtering steps yielded 536 macrophage samples. Next, we filtered 
samples based on library size, numbers of expressed genes, and mito-
chondrial gene counts, as recommended for single-cell RNA-seq analy-
sis (49). For library size, we eliminated samples with extremely low sum 
log2 counts across all genes (with the cutoff defined as the sample-wise 
median of the sum log2 count minus three times the sample-wise median 
absolute deviation) (49). For numbers of expressed genes, we eliminat-
ed samples with an extremely low number of genes with nonzero counts 
(with the cutoff defined as the sample-wise median minus three times the 
sample-wise median absolute deviation). Finally, we eliminated any sam-
ple in which the percentage of counts that were in mitochondrial genes 
was anomalously high (with the threshold defined as the sample-wise 
median plus three times the sample-wise median absolute deviation). 
After this filtering, 452 macrophage samples remained. We tested genes 
for differential expression using the edgeR software package (50), using 
the general linear model (GLM) approach including normalization, which 
enabled us to compare progression to baseline, regression to baseline, 
and regression to progression sample groups. We used a minimum abso-
lute log2 ratio of 1.0 for filtering for differential expression, in addition to 
thresholding the P value for differential expression to limit the estimat-
ed false discovery rate (for each of the sample group comparisons) to 5% 
based on the Benjamini-Hochberg method (51). Data submitted to NCBI 
GEO; accession number, GSE97941.
Lipid and lipoprotein analyses. Plasma total cholesterol levels were 
determined by enzymatic assays (Wako Life Sciences). Plasma HDL 
cholesterol was determined by precipitating non-HDL cholesterol 
(Wako Diagnostic) and then assaying the remaining cholesterol with 
Infinity Total Cholesterol Reagent.
Immunohistochemistry and plaque assessment. The pre-transplant 
baseline and grafted arches were removed after perfusion of cold PBS, 
embedded in OCT, and frozen. Serial sections (6 μm thick) were cut 
and stained for CD68 (AbD Serotec, catalog MCA1957) to detect mono-
cyte-derived cells as previously described (22). The same immunostain-
ing protocol with different primary antibodies was used in order to detect 
CD206, widely known as mannose receptor (MR) (AbD Serotec, catalog 
MCA2235), ARG1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., catalog sc-20150), 
MCP-1 (BioLegend, catalog 505908), CD45.1 (SouthernBiotech, catalog

catalog Ab 16667), and cleaved caspase 3 (Cell Signaling Technology,
