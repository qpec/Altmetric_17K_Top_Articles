Abstract
Background: The morphology of dogs can provide information about their predisposition to some disorders. For
example, larger breeds are predisposed to hip dysplasia and many neoplastic diseases. Therefore, longitudinal
trends in popularity of dog morphology can reveal potential disease pervasiveness in the future. There have been
reports on the popularity of particular breeds and behavioural traits but trends in the morphological traits of
preferred breeds have not been studied.
Methods: This study investigated trends in the height, dog size and head shape (cephalic index) of Australian
purebred dogs. One hundred eighty-one breeds derived from Australian National Kennel Council (ANKC) registration
statistics from 1986 to 2013 were analysed. Weighted regression analyses were conducted to examine trends in the
traits by using them as outcome variables, with year as the explanatory variable and numbers of registered dogs as
weights. Linear regression investigated dog height and cephalic index (skull width/skull length), and multinomial
logistic regression studied dog size.
Results: The total number of ANKC registration had decreased gradually from 95,792 in 1986 to 66,902 in 2013. Both
weighted minimal height (p = 0.014) and weighted maximal height (p < 0.001) decreased significantly over time, and
the weighted cephalic index increased significantly (p < 0.001). The odds of registration of medium and small breeds
increased by 5.3 % and 4.2 %, respectively, relative to large breeds (p < 0.001) and by 12.1 % and 11.0 %, respectively,
relative to giant breeds (p < 0.001) for each 5-year block of time.
Conclusions: Compared to taller and larger breeds, shorter and smaller breeds have become relatively popular over
time. Mean cephalic index has increased, which indicates that Australians have gradually favoured breeds with shorter
and wider heads (brachycephalic). These significant trends indicate that the dog morphological traits reported here
may potentially influence how people select companion dogs in Australia and provide valuable predictive information
on the pervasiveness of diseases in dogs.

Plain English Summary
Some diseases in dogs are related to certain physical
characteristics. For example, larger breeds have a higher
risk of getting hip dysplasia and certain neoplastic dis-
eases while breeds with wider and shorter heads, such as
Pug and French bulldog, are more likely to experience
breathing problems and dystocia. Therefore, if we know
the trends in popularity of dogs of a certain morphology,
we may be able to predict disease pervasiveness.
The study aimed to investigate the trends in the height,
dog size and head shape of Australian purebred dogs. The
numbers of dogs registered within the 181 breeds in
Australian National Kennel Council (ANKC) every year
from 1986 to 2013 were obtained and analysed.
The total number of ANKC registration had decreased
from 95,792 in 1986 to 66,902 in 2013. Compared to

 taller and larger breeds, shorter and smaller breeds have
become relatively popular over time. Also, the data sug-
gest that Australians increasingly favour dogs with shorter
and wider heads for whose welfare veterinarians often ex-
press concern [1, 2].
The results indicate that dog height, dog size and dog
head shape may potentially influence how people select
companion dogs in Australia and provide valuable predict-
ive information on trends in disease prevalence, enabling
the veterinary profession and industry to prepare for
potential future caseloads.
Background
Breed predispositions to disease are well recognized [3].
Regardless of breed, the morphologies of dogs often imply
an individual’s predisposition to some disorders [4]. For
example, hip dysplasia [5, 6], gastric dilatation volvulus
[7, 8] and many neoplastic diseases [9] frequently occur
in larger sized breeds of dogs. In contrast, smaller breeds
of are predisposed to myxomatous mitral valve disease
[10] and tracheal collapse [11–13]. Additionally, brachy-
cephalic breeds are susceptible to several health concerns
such as brachycephalic airway obstruction syndrome
(BAOS) [14, 15], dystocia in dams [16], digestive disor-
ders and multiple eye conditions [4].
People prefer different types of dogs and use various
criteria for selecting their household dogs, which can be
influenced by human lifestyle, cultural backgrounds, media
exposure, education, etc. Therefore, changes in any of these
may impact the decision making process in dog selection.
For example, the purpose of keeping dogs has been shifting
from specific functionalities to primarily companion in the
western world and this would potentially have had impacts
on people’s choice of dogs [17]. Several studies have been
conducted to understand the trends in the popularity of
dogs and their reasons. A previous study on trends in the
popularity of purebred dogs suggested that breeds became
highly favoured mainly by chance without a specific trend
[18]. It was also proposed that social influence (fashion) is
the primary influence on the popularity of companion dog
breeds, which is related to media exposure [19, 20], and
that people showed no preference to breeds with sound
health and good behaviours [19, 21]. However, although
the appearance and the size of the dog are often considered
while selecting a companion dog, we are not aware of any
research conducted to reveal the potential trends in the
popularity of morphological traits of dogs.
This study was conducted to investigate potential trends
in some morphological traits of Australian purebred dogs,
including dog height, dog size and cephalic index (skull
width divided by skull length), by analysing a 28-year-long
(1986–2013) Australian National Kennel Council (ANKC)
dog registration dataset (Additional file 1) [22].
Methods
Data collection and management
ANKC has recorded and published the registration num-
bers of each ANKC-recognised breed on their website each
year since 1986 [22]. For every year from 1986 to 2013, the
numbers of dogs registered for 181 breeds were drawn
from the ANKC registration report. For some breeds, there
were more than one observation due to the breeds’
variation, such as Chihuahua, whose hair can be long
or smooth; therefore, 204 observations (each breed and its
variations) were independently included in the study.
Height and weight references of breeds were obtained
from the ANKC studbook [23] or from the Encyclopedia
of Dog Breeds (EoDB) [24], if not available in the stud-
book. Height is the distance from a dog’s withers to the
ground. The lowest and highest height values in one
breed were chosen as the minimal and maximal heights
for the breed, respectively, and the minimal and maximal
weight were determined likewise. For example, as the min-
imal and maximal heights in male Saint Bernard are 70
and 90 cm and 65 and 80 cm for female, respectively, 65
and 90 cm were then considered as the minimal and max-
imal height values for Saint Bernard. The weight range for
each breed was used to assign breeds to one of the four
size groups, namely, small (less than 10 kg), medium
(10 kg to less than 25 kg), large (25 to less than 40 kg)
and giant (40 kg and over) based on the widely applied
criteria [25–27]. A breed belonged to a size group when
its whole weight range located in the group; otherwise,
it would be classified into the group whose range cov-
ered the average of minimal and maximal weight of the
breed. Breeds with only one weight value were cate-
gorised according to the specified value. Cephalic index
and standard deviations of both sexes for 80 breeds
were drawn from the literature and calculated for each
breed [28]. Larger cephalic index indicates the head
shape of the breed is more brachycephalic, whereas
breeds with smaller values have a more dolichocephalic
shape of head. Characteristics and their source of the
most popular 20 breeds in Australia in 2013 are presented
in Table 1 and Additional file 2 lists the information of all
ANKC-recognised breeds.
Statistical methods
Data were extracted into and cleaned in Microsoft Excel
2010 spreadsheets. Descriptive statistics were generated
for the overall trends in the number of registrations and
in each morphological trait in Microsoft Excel 2010. The
means of minimal height, maximal height, minimal weight,
maximal weight and cephalic index, weighted by the regis-
tration numbers, over the 28 years were calculated and
plotted, as well as the proportions of registration number
of each size group. Correlation between minimal height,
maximal height, minimal weight and maximal weight were
Teng et al. Canine Genetics and Epidemiology  (2016) 3:2

 calculated. To insure that the contribution of each observa-
tion is proportional to the number of registration, weighted
regression analyses were then conducted to examine trends
in each trait, using the trait as the outcome variable, year
as the explanatory variable and numbers of registered dogs
as weights to account for different numbers of registration
of each breed each year. Linear regression investigated dog
height and cephalic index and multinomial logistic regres-
sion studied dog size by using the SAS statistical program,
9.3th edition (SAS Institute, Cary, NC. USA). Normality
and homoscedasticity were assessed by visual inspection
of residual and residual-versus-fitted plots. A two sided
P-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Descriptive statistics
The total number of ANKC registration had decreased
gradually from 95,792 in 1986 to 66,902 in 2013. A
precipitous fluctuation in numbers registered between
1997–1998 was noted (Fig. 1a). The numbers of breeds
and their variations which have at least one registry in-
creased from 144 to 183 from 1986 to 2013. While the
majority of the height records were sourced from the
ANKC studbook (n = 140) and the remaining from the
EoDB (n = 64), similar numbers of weight records were
extracted from the ANKC studbook (n = 86) and the
EoDB (n = 94). Standard Poodle had no maximal height
value, whereas Smooth and Wire Fox Terrier, Toy Poo-
dle, Shih Tzu, Tibetan Spaniel and Welsh Terrier had
no minimal height values. In addition, 23 breeds and
both variations of German Spitz (German Spitz Klein
and German Spitz Mittel) were not classified into any
size groups due to no weight records being available
from the sources consulted. In total, there were 54
small breeds, 62 medium breeds, 42 large breeds, and
22 giant breeds for which data were used in this study.
The weighted mean of maximal height decreased from
50.0 cm in 1986 to 48.3 cm in 2013, and weighted mean
of minimal height decreased from 43.6 cm in 1986 to
42.7 cm in 2013 (Figs. 1b and 2). Weighted mean of
cephalic index increased from 57.7 in 1986 to 62.9 in
2013 (Fig. 1c). The proportions of small, medium and
large breeds ranged between 0.26 to 0.36 in the 28-year
period, while the proportion of giant breed only ranged
from 0.07 to 0.14 (Fig. 1d). The proportion of medium
sized breeds steadily increased over time.

 Modelling results
Correlations between minimal and maximal heights, and
minimal and maximal weights were 0.98 (p < 0.001) and
0.96 (p < 0.001), respectively. Correlations between min-
imal height and weight, and maximal height and weight
were 0.82 (p < 0.001) and 0.86 (p < 0.001), respectively.
The results suggested that both weighted minimal height
and maximal height decreased significantly over time while
the weighted cephalic index increased significantly during
the period (Table 2). The multinomial logistic model
results indicated that odds of registration of medium and
small breeds increased by 5.3 % and 4.2 %, respectively,
relative to large breeds (p < 0.001) and by 12.1 % and
11.0 %, respectively, compared to giant breeds (p < 0.001)
(Table 3) for each 5-year block of time.
Discussion
This study reveals previously undocumented trends in
morphological traits of purebred dogs in Australia by using
the ANKC registry dataset. Shorter and smaller breeds, as

 well as breeds with larger cephalic index, show growing
popularity in ANKC registrations in the 28 years. These
significant trends provide valuable predictive information
on the pervasiveness of diseases in Australian companion
dogs.
The total registration numbers have been continuously
declining with a difference of about 30,000 over the
28 years. This can be due to decreases purely in num-
bers registered to ANKC, purebred dog numbers in
Australia, dog numbers in Australia, or any combination
of these factors. It is noted that the numbers of ANKC
memberships have decreased from 54,590 in 1995 to
33,119 in 2013 [29]. However, new dog registrations
would mostly depend on the number of newborn pedi-
gree dogs rather than the number of ANKC members,
and a breeder can have more than one breeding bitch.
The profile of pedigree dog breeders may have been
compromised by media focus on inherited disorders and
puppy farms; this in combination with the promotion of
adoptions may have reduced the demand for purebred
dogs in Australia. In addition, the recent surges of popu-
larity of designer breeds, those are crossbred with two
different breeds of dogs, is noticed by veterinarians. The
trend can also partially result from reduced dog popula-
tion size in Australia. Pet industry figures indicate a
decreasing trend from 1998 to 2009 [30], although there
are also recent predictions of an upturn in Australian
dog numbers [31].
Changes to human lifestyle, to dwelling types and to
the roles of dogs in human societies can affect dog
owners’ decisions about dog acquisition including pre-
ferred breed or type. From 1995 to 2010, the proportion
of single separate house purchases (excluding semi-
detached/row and townhouse/terrace house) decreased
and flat/unit/apartment purchases increased among first
home buyers with a mortgage in Australia [32], which
may indicate that space available for dogs would also
have shrunk. Moreover, the major purposes of dog own-
ership nowadays have changed from certain functional-
ities such as hunting and guarding properties, for which
dogs are more likely to be larger, to purely companion-
ship, a purpose which can be fulfilled by dogs of various
size [17]. These may be two of the many possible expla-
nations of trends in dog height and dog size observed in
the current study.
The results show that breeds with a larger cephalic
index have steadily become more popular, which indi-
cates that Australians have gradually favoured dogs with
shorter and wider heads (brachycephalic) more than those
with longer and thinner heads (dolichocephalic). The bra-
chycephaly boom seems to be worldwide. In agreement
with our results, brachycephalic breeds such as English
Bulldogs, French Bulldogs, Boxers and Pugs, have been
becoming increasingly popular in the United Kingdom
(UK) over recent years [33], and the numbers of Bulldogs
and French bulldogs registered with the American Kennel
Club have increased by 69 % and 476 %, respectively, in
the past decade [34]. The typical skull shape of a breed
often aligns with the breed’s original purpose. For ex-
ample, medium and large size brachycephalic breeds have
stronger bite force [35], which seems to align with their
common historic role in baiting and fighting context [36].
On the other hand, a dolichocephalic morphology is as-
sociated with a breed’s ability as a visual hunter [37].
However, as functionality has become a minor incentive

 to acquire dogs, the popularity of breeds with larger
cephalic index may have two possible causes instead of
functionality. Firstly, the neotenic appearance of bra-
chycephalic dogs may account for the popularity [38].
Many research studies have shown that the infantile facial
features stimulate affective and caretaking behavioural re-
sponses in human adults, which has the evolutionary
benefits of increasing the survival of the vulnerable in-
dividuals [39–42]. These cute features, defined by
Konrad Lorenz (1943), are called “baby schema” [43],
including large head, round face, chubby cheeks, high
and protruding forehead, big eyes, small nose and mouth,
etc. Interestingly, baby schema effect has been observed
not merely in human infant but also cross species
[44–46]. The head of brachycephalic dogs is characterised
by a round and short face, open orbitae, a small and short
nose, which accord with the baby schema features [38].
Therefore, baby schema effect may explain the increas-
ing popularity of brachycephalic breeds. Secondly, a
flux in perceived aesthetics may be responsible for the
phenomenon. It has been confirmed that human behav-
iours and preferences can be contagious without rationale
[47]. One study endorses this theory by demonstrating
that fads play a major factor in choosing the breed of
companion dogs [19].
Accompanying the trends in the prevalence of the mor-
phological traits revealed in this study, we predict corre-
sponding changes in the patterns of disease occurrence in
dogs in Australia: diseases among smaller breeds and bra-
chycephalic breeds are expected to be seen increasingly by
the veterinary profession in Australia. The predicted in-
crease in veterinary observation of diseases that pre-
dominantly affect these types of dogs can be tracked by
examining and analysing electronic patient health records
from primary care veterinary clinics longitudinally.
With the increase of smaller and brachycephalic dogs,
conditions leading to mortality in small breeds (urogenital
diseases, degenerative diseases, metabolic diseases) will
potentially be seen more, compared to those that have an
increased risk of death in larger breeds, such as diseases of
musculoskeletal and gastrointestinal systems and many
neoplastic diseases [48]. Through reviewing the literature,
we have identified 13 common diseases in smaller breeds,
compared to 25 diseases in larger breeds listed in the
Additional file 3. In larger breeds, 28 % of the diseases
are musculoskeletal, 20 % are nervous/sensory, 16 %
are cardiovascular, and 36 % belong to the rest organ
systems. In contrast, in smaller breeds, no clusters of
diseases of specific organ systems have been noticed.
Among the dog-size predisposed diseases, patellar lux-
ation (PL), portosystemic shunt (PSS) and mammary
tumour (MT) show different forms of predispositions
in smaller and larger breeds. While PL was originally
recognised as a condition to which smaller breeds were
predisposed [49], the occurrence in larger breeds ap-
pears to be increasing [50, 51]. Medial PLs are the pre-
dominant condition regardless of dog size [52], whereas
the lateral form is reported more frequently in larger
breeds [51, 53]. PSS is generally more prevalent in
smaller breeds [54–56], especially in the form of extra-
hepatic PSSs [54, 57]. In contrast, intrahepatic PSS cases
are seen more commonly in larger breeds [54, 58, 59]. Al-
though MT is more frequently seen in smaller breeds of
dogs [60], the MTs with greater malignancy [61] and thus
a more profound effect on life expectancy are encountered
among larger breeds [60]. We would like to acknowledge
that the common diseases and disease occurrence may
not be the same in different continents/countries due to
the divergent gene pool although many of the disease pre-
dispositions are commonly recognised worldwide.
Concerns for the welfare of brachycephalic dogs have
been highlighted recently and, as reported by our results
and the literature, this issue is likely to become an in-
creasing concern for veterinarians and dog owners in
Australia and worldwide. In New Zealand, 4 of the top 5
dog breeds considered by veterinarians to be unsuitable
for continued breeding due to compromised health and
welfare are brachycephalic breeds [1]. The life expect-
ancy is estimated 4 years lower in highly brachycephalic
breeds than those not (8.6 years vs 12.7 years) [62].
BAOS, resulting in mild to life-threatening respiratory
dysfunction [14], has received attention in the UK fol-
lowing the growing popularity of brachycephalic breeds
in that country [33, 63]. However, a UK study showed
that approximately half of the owners of BAOS affected
dogs seem unaware of BAOS in their dogs [64], which

 indicates that they did not make informed decisions
when they purchased them, that dogs might not receive
necessarily medical treatment when BAOS emerges, and
that the use of affected dogs might persist in breeding
programmes. Cephalopelvic disproportion between whelps
and dams is thought to be responsible for dystocia in
brachycephalic dogs and to lead to inevitable caesarean
section [65]. One paper reports caesarean section being
performed to deliver over 80 % of litters for registered
pedigree bitches of Boston Terrier, English Bulldog and
French Bulldog in the UK [66], and the biggest Swedish
insurance company applies special rules for reimburse-
ment associated with caesarean section to these three
breeds [67]. Additionally, there is some suggestion that
pregnant brachycephalic dams often receive caesarean
section before natural parturition begins [66]. Other
brachycephalic-predisposed conditions include mast cell
tumours [68], chemoreceptor system neoplasms [69–71],
hydrocephalus [72] and multiple digestive, ocular and
dermatological disorders [4, 73].
This is the first trend study in the popularity of canine
morphological traits other than those determined solely
by breed. By fitting model of random genetic drift,
Herzog suggests that the randomness of fashion largely
explains the popularity of dog breeds [18, 19]. Another
study shows no correlation between popularity and the
longevity or the desirable behavioural tendencies of
breeds [21]. As our results show linear relationships
between certain morphological traits of dogs and time,
this may suggest that the preference for morphological
features of dogs may be embedded in social changes
and trends, such as urbanisation and pursuit of cuteness,
which influence people’s criteria for selecting household
dogs. By knowing that dog size is often a consideration
while choosing a dog along with our results [74], it is
reasonable to conclude that dog height and dog size
may potentially be one of the major considerations in
decision making process of selecting companion dogs
in Australia. However, we would also like to acknowledge
that there may be other unmeasured factors influencing
trends in dog numbers over time that we cannot capture
from the data we have.
This study has a number of possible limitations that
we wish to acknowledge. Firstly, although the ANKC
dog registration dataset has high data integrity with few
missing data, the results are highly representative of
ANKC-registered dogs, and so may not truly represent
either the purebred population or general dog popula-
tion in Australia. The ANKC estimates that 16.5 % of
newborn puppies in Australia in 2014 were from ANKC
[75]. That said, since the ANKC is the leading kennel
club in Australia, it is plausible that the composition of
dog breeds in the Australian purebred population re-
flects those registered with ANKC. However, this would
be based on the assumption that purebred dogs outside
of ANCK also strictly follow the ANKC breed standards,
which may not be true. Secondly, not all the height and
weight records are representative of Australian purebred
dogs since some are derived from EoDB, where most stan-
dards are from the American Kennel Club. Additionally,
both of these sources adopt various standardising methods
for different breeds, which limits the consistency of our
data. For instance, while most breeds have minimal and
maximal height restriction for both sexes, some have a
height range for the breed or only a mean height. Thirdly,
even though dog size groups are commonly used for re-
search and in everyday veterinary practice, no universal
dog sizing criteria can be found from the literature. For
the current study, we classified dog size according to dog
weight, as is standard practice in academic research and is
considered a better predictor of lifespan than dog height
[76]. Lastly, although significant linear trends appear in
the changes of the morphological traits over time, we
could only postulate about the best explanations for the
identified trends but were not be able to test the causality
in the current study.
Conclusions
This study identifies that, over the 28-year period
(1986–2013), shorter and smaller breeds became relatively
popular, compared to taller and larger breeds, and the
mean cephalic index increased, suggesting that Australians
are tending to prefer breeds with a wider and shorter head.
These significant trends indicate that the dog morpho-
logical traits reported here may potentially influence how
people select companion dogs in Australia and suggest
valuable predictive information on the pervasiveness of dis-
eases, enabling the veterinary profession and industry to
prepare for potential future caseloads. It would be interest-
ing to examine similar datasets from other countries.
