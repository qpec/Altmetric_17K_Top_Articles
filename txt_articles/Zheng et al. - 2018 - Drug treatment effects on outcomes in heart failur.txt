AbsTrACT
background clinical drug trials in patients with heart 
failure and preserved ejection fraction have failed to 
demonstrate improvements in mortality.
Methods We systematically searched Medline, embase 
and the cochrane central register of controlled 
trials for randomised controlled trials (rct) assessing 
pharmacological treatments in patients with heart failure 
with left ventricular (lV) ejection fraction≥40% from 
January 1996 to May 2016. the primary efficacy outcome 
was all-cause mortality. secondary outcomes were 
cardiovascular mortality, heart failure hospitalisation, 
exercise capacity (6-min walk distance, exercise duration, 
VO2 max), quality of life and biomarkers (B-type 
natriuretic peptide, n-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic 
peptide). random-effects models were used to estimate 
pooled relative risks (rr) for the binary outcomes, and 
weighted mean differences for continuous outcomes, 
with 95% ci.
results We included data from 25 rcts comprising 
data for 18101 patients. all-cause mortality was reduced 
with beta-blocker therapy compared with placebo (rr: 
0.78, 95%ci 0.65 to 0.94, p=0.008). there was no 
effect seen with ace inhibitors, aldosterone receptor 
blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists and 
other drug classes, compared with placebo. similar 
results were observed for cardiovascular mortality. no 
single drug class reduced heart failure hospitalisation 
compared with placebo.
Conclusion the efficacy of treatments in patients with 
heart failure and an lV ejection fraction≥40% differ 
depending on the type of therapy, with beta-blockers 
demonstrating reductions in all-cause and cardiovascular 
mortality. Further trials are warranted to confirm 
treatment effects of beta-blockers in this patient group.
InTroduCTIon
Heart failure with preserved left ventricular (LV) 
ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a heterogeneous clin-
ical syndrome defined by the presence of signs 
and symptoms of heart failure without evidence 
of reduced LV ejection fraction (typically consid-
ered as <40%).1 While significant advances have 
been made in the treatment of heart failure with 
reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), randomised 
controlled trials (RCT) of pharmacological thera-
pies in heart failure with an LV ejection fraction 
of 40% or more have been generally disappointing 
with no convincing demonstration of mortality or 
morbidity reduction. Updated guidelines recom-
mend the use of diuretics for symptom relief 
and appropriate management of comorbidities 
(including hypertension), while acknowledging the 
absence of specific disease-modifying therapies in 
this condition.1 2
Although trial evidence demonstrating improve-
ments in mortality have been inconsistent and 
largely neutral, several trials have suggested that 
drug therapy may improve exercise tolerance and 
quality of life.3 Since patients with HFpEF tend to 
be older with more comorbidities than their HFrEF 
counterparts,4 5 the efficacy of drug treatments 
might best be evaluated by their effects on hospi-
talisation, functional status, symptoms and quality 
of life.1
In this study, we aimed to systematically review 
the clinical trials of patients with HFpEF (defined 
as LV ejection fraction ≥40%), and identify treat-
ment effects on mortality, heart failure hospitalisa-
tion, functional status and biomarker levels.
MeTHods
This article has been reported in accordance with 
the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic 
Reviews and Meta-Analyses.6 No published study 
protocol exists for this meta-analysis.
definition of heart failure with preserved 
ejection fraction
The latest European Society of Cardiology guide-
lines introduced the term heart failure with 
mid-range ejection fraction (HFmrEF), categorising 
an intermediate group of patients with an LV 
ejection fraction of between 40% and 49%, with 
HFpEF defined as an LV ejection fraction ≥50% 
with the same echocardiographic criteria.1 The 
American College of Cardiology defines HFpEF 
as an LV ejection fraction >40%, with anything 
from 41% to 49% as borderline HFpEF.2 While 
the terminology has changed in the process of this 
meta-analysis being undertaken, the aim of this 
study was to identify treatment effects in the group 
of patients with heart failure with LV ejection frac-
tion ≥40%, for which no guideline-recommended 
therapies currently exist. In the HFpEF popula-
tion, RCTs have used various LV ejection fraction 
cut-offs, ranging from 40% to 50%, and therefore 
data summarised in this meta-analysis will include 
patients in the mid-range and borderline group.

search strategy and selection criteria
A systematic search of Medline, Embase and the Cochrane 
Central Register of Controlled Trials was performed using the 
search strategy documented in the online supplementary mate-
rials. Results were filtered for randomised controlled trials using 
predesigned and validated filters. The search was run on 1 May 
2016, with results included from database inception to 1 May 
2016. The search was rerun on 1 April 2017 and no additional 
articles were identified. The reference lists of included studies 
were searched for additional analyses. A systematic approach 
was used to identify systematic reviews and meta-analyses 
published during this period, which were hand-screened for 
additional trials.
Trials were considered eligible if they were (a) RCT; (b) 
enrolled participants with heart failure and documented LV ejec-
tion fraction ≥40%; (c) compared drug therapy with placebo, 
no treatment, diuretic treatment or standard medical treat-
ment, with a minimum follow-up of at least 12 weeks and (d) 
provided information on prespecified primary and secondary 
end points that included all-cause mortality, cardiovascular 
mortality, heart failure hospitalisation, exercise capacity (6 
min 
walk distance (6MWD), exercise duration, VO2 max), quality 
of life as measured using the Minnesota Living With Heart 
Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ) and biomarkers (B-type 
natriuretic peptide (BNP), N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic 
peptide (NT-proBNP)). Non-English language publications were 
excluded. We allowed secondary publications of included trials 
if they reported additional outcomes that were not present in the 
original article.
After removal of duplicates, the title and abstracts of initial 
search results were screened for relevance. The full texts of 
remaining results were independently assessed by two authors 
(SLZ, FTC) for inclusion based on predetermined inclusion and 
exclusion criteria. The final list of included studies was decided 
by discussion between authors and required full agreement. No 
disagreements required resolution by a third reviewer. Study 
selection flow diagram is shown in figure 1.

onto a dedicated database. The data extracted from each report 
included baseline patient characteristics (age, sex, comorbidities, 
mean ejection fraction), study inclusion criteria, study drug and 
control treatment, follow-up duration and end point data.
The Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool was used to 
assess risk of bias. Disagreements in abstracted data were adjudi-
cated by a third reviewer (AAN). Egger test was used to identify 
asymmetry of funnel plots for publication bias.
statistical analysis
Random-effects models were used to estimate pooled effect 
size from aggregate data.7 For binary outcomes, estimates were 
summarised as relative risk (RR) and 95% CI. For continuous 
outcomes, weighted mean difference (MD) and 95% CIs were 
calculated. Studies with no outcome events in the treatment 
or placebo groups, and therefore did not contribute to the risk 
ratios, were excluded from the RR pooled estimates, and were 
summarised using risk differences. Estimates and 95% CIs were 
graphically presented using Forest plots.8 χ2 test was used to 
compare differences between stratified subgroup RR.
Results were stratified by drug type (beta-blocker, ACE inhib-
itor, angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), mineralocorticoid 
receptor antagonist (MRA), combined renin-angiotensin-aldo-
sterone system (RAAS) antagonists and other drug types), dura-
tion of follow-up (3–12 months and >12 months), LV ejection 
fraction entry threshold (40%–49% and ≥50%) and mean LV 
ejection fraction (<60% 
and ≥60%). The original protocol did 
not specify stratifying by patient’s LV ejection fraction (40%–
49% and ≥50%). No trials enrolled patients exclusively with LV 
ejection fraction between 40% and 49%, and no trials reported 
subgroup analyses of this group.
Between-study heterogeneity was assessed using I² statistics, 
which describes the percentage of variation across studies that 
is due to heterogeneity rather than chance.9 Publication bias 
was assessed if the number of trials was reasonable (10 or more) 
using funnel plots. No assessment was made for smaller number 
of trials due to the established poor performance of the test.10 
Statistical analysis was performed using the software STATA 
V
.14 and Review Manager V
.5.3.
resulTs
The electronic search identified 4161 articles that were screened 
and evaluated for eligibility based on title and abstract only 
(figure 1). After removal of duplicate (368) and non-relevant 
(3605) articles, 188 articles were evaluated in full-text for 
eligibility. A further 163 articles were excluded, and two addi-
tional eligible articles were identified from searching systematic 
reviews and reference lists. In all, 27 articles were included for 
meta-analysis, comprising data from 25 trials, with 28 separate 
comparisons (see online supplementary file 1). In total, 18 
101 
patients were randomised to either drug intervention or placebo, 
control or standard medical therapy. There were six beta-
blocker trials enrolling 1299 patients, 5 ACE inhibitor (1305 
participants), 6 ARB (9704 participants) and 5 MRA (4003 
participants) trials. Other drugs tested include one digoxin (988 
participants), two calcium channel blocker (242 participants), 
one sildenafil (216 participants), one sitaxsentan (192 partici-
pants) and one doxazosin (145 participants) trial. Seven studies 
used an LV ejection fraction threshold of 40%, and nine used 
LV ejection fraction thresholds of 45% and 50%. The inclu-
sion criteria for Study of Effects of Nebivolol Intervention on 
Outcomes and Rehospitalization in Seniors With Heart Failure 
(SENIORS) included either an LV ejection fraction threshold 
of 35% or previous hospitalisation for heart failure regardless 
of ejection fraction, with subgroup analysis of patients with LV 
ejection fraction ≥40%, and so the study was included in the 
pooled analysis.11
effect of therapy on all-cause mortality, cardiovascular 
mortality and heart failure hospitalisation
Stratification by drug class
The search identified 16 studies that reported all-cause 
mortality events in one or both arms, which were pooled 
for analysis. Beta-blockers were the only pharmacolog-
ical agent that reduced the risk of all-cause mortality 
compared with control (RR: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.65 to 0.94, 
p=0.008, n=1046)11–13 (figure 2, table 1). Pooled analysis 
of ACE inhibitor (RR: 1.10, 95% CI: 0.85 to 1.43, p=0.46, 
n=1234),14–17 ARB (RR: 1.02, 95% CI: 0.93 to 1.12, p=0.71, 
n=7257)14 18–20 and MRA (RR: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.79 to 1.08, 
p=0.32, n=3867)21 22 trials showed no effect on all-cause 
mortality compared with control. Pooled trials of drugs 
blocking the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) 
(ACE inhibitor, ARB and MRA) did not reduce all-cause 
mortality (RR: 1.00, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.08, p=0.97, n=12 358) 
(see online supplementary figure 1A). Pooled effects of other 
drug types showed no difference (RR: 0.95, 95% CI: 078 to 
1.15, p=0.58, n=1576).16 23 24
Cardiovascular mortality was reduced in beta-blocker therapy 
compared with controls (RR: 0.75, 95% 
CI: 0.60 to 0.94, 
p=0.01, n=1046), whereas ACE inhibitors (RR: 0.94, 95% 
CI: 
0.62 to 1.43, p=0.77, n=945) and ARB (RR: 1.02, 95% 
CI: 
0.90 to 1.14, p=0.79, n=7257) had no effect on cardiovas-
cular mortality (figure 3). There was no effect of pooled RAAS 
blockade (RR 0.99, 95% 
CI 0.89 to 1.09, p=0.77) on cardiovas-
cular mortality compared with controls (see online supplemen-
tary figure 2A).
Pooled RAAS blockade reduced the risk for heart failure hospi-
talisation (RR=0.90, 95% 
CI: 0.82 to 0.98, p=0.01, n=11 
765), 
though ACE inhibitors (RR: 0.86, 95% 
CI: 0.64 to 1.15, 
p=0.32, n=1019) and ARB (RR 0.92, 95% 
CI: 0.83 to 1.02, 
p=0.13, n=7301) had no effect individually (online supplemen-
tary figure 3A and figure 4). There was no effect of beta-blocker 
therapy on heart failure hospitalisation (RR: 0.67, 95% 
CI: 0.42 
to 1.07, p=0.10, n=382) (figure 4). Only one trial of MRA 
(Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure With an 
Aldosterone Antagonist trial (TOPCAT)21 reported cardiovas-
cular mortality and heart failure hospitalisation outcomes (HR: 
0.90, p=0.35 
and HR: 0.83, p=0.04, respectively).
Meta-analysis of all trials revealed that pharmacotherapy 
did not improve all-cause (RR: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.90 to 1.03, 
p=0.26) or cardiovascular (RR: 0.95, 95% CI: 0.87 to 1.03, 
p=0.23) mortality, but reduced heart failure hospitalisation 
(RR: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.81 to 0.95, p=0.002). When all trials 
(including trials with no events in both arms) were considered 
using the mean weighted absolute risk difference, no signifi-
cant difference was observed between treatment and control 
groups for all-cause mortality (Risk Difference (RD): −0.00%, 
95% CI: −0.01% to 0.01%, p=0.99, n=15 340), or cardio-
vascular mortality (RD: −0.00%, 95% CI: −0.01% to 0.01%, 
p=0.70, n=14 257) (see online supplementary figure 1B and 
2B). Heart failure hospitalisation showed a small but significant 
difference in risk favouring treatment (RD: −0.02%, 95% CI: 
−0.03 to −0.00%, p=0.005, n=13 491), driven by the treat-
ment effect of RAAS blockade (see online supplementary 
figure 3B). Summary of effects for all primary and secondary

outcomes by stratification is shown in online supplementary 
table 2.
Stratification by LV ejection fraction inclusion threshold
When analyses were stratified by LV ejection fraction inclusion 
threshold (40%–49%, ≥50%), neither group demonstrated 
significant differences in all-cause mortality, with no difference 
between subgroups (χ2=0.05, p=0.83) (see online supplemen-
tary figure 1C). Hospitalisation for heart failure was reduced 
in studies that used LV ejection fraction inclusion cut-offs of 
40%–49% (RR: 0.88, 95% 
CI: 0.82 to 0.96, p=0.002), but not 
in studies using cut-offs of 50% or more (RR: 0.51, 95% 
CI: 
0.18 to 1.48, p=0.22) (χ2=1.01, p=0.31). Only one study 
that reported cardiovascular mortality used an LV ejection frac-
tion inclusion cut-off of 50% making a similar comparison not 
possible for this outcome.
Stratification by mean LV ejection fraction
Comparison of trials with a mean LV ejection fraction <60% 
(five trials, n=7688) with ≥60% (seven trials, n=6062) demon-
strated that neither subgroup reached statistical significance for 
all-cause or cardiovascular mortality, with no difference between 
the subgroups (χ2=1.05, p=0.31) (online supplementary figures 
1E and 2E, table 1). Heart failure hospitalisation was reduced 
in studies with a mean LV ejection fraction <60% (RR: 0.85, 
95% 
CI 0.76 to 0.94, p=0.002), but not in studies with higher 
mean LV ejection fractions (RR: 0.92, 95% 
CI: 0.82 to 1.04, 
p=0.19) (χ2=1.03, p=0.31).

months) demonstrated statis-
tically significant reductions in relative risk for both mortality

effect of therapy on exercise capacity
Ten studies (n=1870 
patients) reported on 6MWD, eight studies 
(n=938) reported on exercise time after treatment and six 
studies (n=924) reported on VO2 max. There was no signifi-
cant difference between groups for exercise time, VO2 max and 
6MWD (see online supplementary figure 4).
effect of therapy on quality of life
Nine trials reported the treatment effects on quality of life as 
measured by the MLHFQ, including a total of 3510 patients 
(beta-blocker: 116 patients, ACE inhibitor: 166, ARB: 2460, 
MRA: 444, other: 324). Overall estimate showed that treatment 
resulted in better quality of life scores (MD: −1.63, 95% 
CI: 
−2.94 to −0.31, p=0.001) (see online supplementary figure 5).

Thirteen trials reported BNP and NT-proBNP levels after 
treatment (see online supplementary table 3). Studies had a 
high degree of heterogeneity (I2=84.4%) and were not further 
analysed.

dIsCussIon
The results of this meta-analysis show significant reductions 
in all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in RCTs using beta-
blockers, while RAAS blockade (using ACE inhibitor, ARB 
and MRA individually) demonstrated no effect on mortality. 
Improvements in functional outcomes and quality of life were 
not significantly or consistently demonstrated using pooled 
results. Heterogeneity within trials that reported biomarker 
outcomes was too high to allow comparison.
The effect of beta-blockade on mortality suggests favourable 
outcomes in patients with LV ejection fraction >40%. Similar 
benefits have been demonstrated in pooled analysis of obser-
vational studies and previous meta-analyses.26–29 Of the three 
beta-blocker trials, only one trial individually showed a signif-
icant reduction in mortality,12 and contributed the greatest 
weight to overall effects due to the high event rate. The two 
larger RCTs showed neutral results, although were both under-
powered to detect effects on mortality.11 13 Notably, all three 
beta-blocker trials used an LV ejection fraction threshold of 40%, 
whereas trials using ACE inhibitor, ARB and MRA tended to use 
higher ejection fraction thresholds. The demonstrated reduc-
tion in mortality with beta-blockers may have been augmented 
by their effects on the HFmrEF population within these trials; 
a group that an emerging body of evidence suggests is more 
closely aligned with HFrEF.30 31 The beneficial effect of beta-
blockers on mortality appears to be through preventing cardio-
vascular death, supported by a 25% reduction in cardiovascular 
mortality. We did not further investigate causes of cardiovascular 
death, although the pleiotropic effects of beta-blocker (such as 
its anti-arrhythmic properties) are likely to be important. Future 
sufficiently powered clinical trials and observational or registry

data will be important in discerning if there is a true effect in 
patients with heart failure with an LV ejection fraction of 40% 
or more, and whether this benefit extends to those with LV ejec-
tion fraction >50%. While we did not demonstrate a benefit for 
beta-blockers in hospitalisation for heart failure, ‘hospitalisation’ 
should not be interpreted in isolation since mortality events will 
impact future hospitalisation events.
Given that patients with HFpEF tend to be older than their 
HFrEF counterparts, and are limited by disabling symptoms with 
poor quality of life, focus of therapy has shifted towards their 
effects on exercise tolerance and quality of life. This meta-anal-
ysis has shown that drug treatment is associated with a trend 
towards improvement in exercise time and significant although 
small improvement in quality of life measured using MLHFQ. 
Previous meta-analyses have been inconsistent in determining 
whether treatment improves exercise capacity,3 32 and the overall 
effects are unlikely to be clinically significant.
Interestingly, we showed that trials with shorter follow-up 
(between 3 and 12 
months) demonstrated greater reductions in 
all clinical end points compared with longer trials. The impor-
tance of follow-up duration in HFpEF clinical trials is best high-
lighted by the Perindopril in Elderly People with Chronic Heart 
Failure (PEP-CHF) study. There was no significant difference in 
its primary outcome of combined all-cause mortality and heart 
failure hospitalisation (p=0.92) after 2.1 
years of follow-up; 
however, a restrictive analysis at 1-year follow-up demon-
strated an important effect in favour of perindopril (p=0.055). 
It is possible that as follow-up duration increases, cross-over of 
patients to unblinded study therapy (eg, for treatment of comor-
bidities) dilutes treatment effects and reduces study power to 
detect statistically meaningful differences. In this cohort of older 
and more comorbid patients, treatment efficacy could wane 
with time as patients develop mortality that is unaffected by 
treatments.
For hard clinical end points, our study did not find any differ-
ence when trials were stratified by LV ejection fraction thresh-
olds (including patients with HFmrEF or not) nor by mean trial 
LV ejection fractions. Stratifying trials in this way results in 
smaller heterogeneous subgroups, and therefore evidence is not 
conclusive. The recently proposed HFmrEF category1 currently 
has no evidence-based treatments, and further clinical trials are 
required to identify whether this group will benefit from existing 
treatments used in HFrEF. Since it will be unlikely that dedicated 
RCTs will be undertaken in this group, meta-analysis using indi-
vidual patient data and post hoc analysis of large trials will be 
important in shedding light on this less studied group. Indeed, 
post hoc analysis of Candesartan in Heart failure: Assessment 
of Reduction in Mortality and morbidity study (CHARM-Pre-
served) demonstrates a significant 24% reduction in CV death 
and time to first heart failure hospitalisation in patients with 
HFmrEF (HR: 0.76, 95% upper CI (UCI) 0.96, p=0.02).33 34 In 
TOPCAT, the potential efficacy of spironolactone was greatest 
in patients with LV ejection fractions <50% (HR: 0.72, UCI 
1.05) compared with ≥60% (HR 0.97, UCI 1.23).35
HFpEF is a highly heterogeneous condition, with interactions 
between comorbidities likely to account for significant cardio-
vascular and non-cardiovascular mortality and morbidity.4 5 The 
effect of treatments on specific HFpEF phenotypes may identify 
subgroups that benefit. Latent class analysis of the I-PRESERVE 
data set identified a group of metabolic phenotype patients 
with HFpEF (high prevalence of diabetes, hyperlipidaemia and 
obesity) that benefited from irbesartan therapy.36 Indeed, further 
understanding of the pathophysiology of HFpEF will help to 
guide research and development of novel therapies.1 5 37
limitations
The aim of the meta-analysis is to determine treatment effects in 
patients with an LV ejection fraction ≥40%. At the time of under-
taking the meta-analysis, these patients were defined as HFpEF, 
and so the nomenclature has been maintained in this article. 
Subsequently, there has been a change in definition with intro-
duction of the HFmrEF category. As a result, pooled analysis is 
for patients with an LV ejection fraction ≥40%, and not ≥50%. 
None of the trials reported subgroup data on patients with an 
LV ejection fraction between 40% and 49%, and therefore we 
are unable to report on the treatment effect in these patients. 
Repeating the meta-analysis with individual patient data will 
provide greater insights into this intermediate group.
Analyses were stratified by drug class (beta-blockers, RAAS 
antagonists and other classes). The drugs in the other category 
include a range of vasodilators, calcium channel blockers and

Heart failure and cardiomyopathies
digoxin and do not exert their effects through the same mecha-
nisms. We have also made aggregate analyses based on all phar-
macological agents, which has limitations, although was used in 
previous HFpEF meta-analyses due to the small number of trials 
in each individual drug class.3 Where data are available, we have 
sought to draw conclusions from comparison within drug classes 
to allow meaningful clinical conclusions to be drawn.
The general limitations associated with meta-analyses extends 
to this current work. We are limited by availability and reporting 
of data.38 Risk ratios were used as only a small number of trials 
reported HRs, which introduces bias associated with comparing 
outcomes in trials of different lengths.
Conclusions
In trials enrolling patients with HFpEF, defined using an LV ejec-
tion fraction ≥40%, beta-blockers reduce all-cause and cardio-
vascular mortality by 22% and 25%, 
respectively. There was no 
significant effect of ACE inhibitors, ARB or MRA on the same 
outcomes. The effect of treatments on functional and quality of 
life outcomes was limited. Further adequately powered RCTs 
in beta-blocker therapy in this patient group is warranted to 
confirm this finding.

Key messages
What is already known on this subject?
There have been no individual large randomised controlled 
trials which demonstrate improvements in clinical outcomes for 
patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction. This 
is represented in the latest European Society of Cardiology Heart 
Failure guidelines, which advocate treatment of comorbidities 
and symptoms.
What might this study add?
This meta-analysis shows that pooled analysis of beta-blocker 
trials demonstrates reductions in all-cause and cardiovascular 
mortality by 22% and 25%, respectively, with no pooled 
effect seen in ACE inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker and 
mineralocorticoid antagonist trials. There may also be a small 
benefit in terms of quality of life with several of the drug classes 
tested, although no difference in functional outcomes.
How might this impact on clinical practice?
Clinicians should consider using beta-blockers when there is an 
existing indication for them. There may be benefit in repeating a 
randomised controlled trial of beta-blockers in heart failure with 
preserved left ventricular ejection fraction with contemporary 
patient cohorts.
