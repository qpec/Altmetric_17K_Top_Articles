Abstract
Introduction While studies have documented racial and eth-
nic disparities in amputation rates for patients with peripheral
artery disease (PAD), the importance of specific factors has
not been quantified. This research seeks to provide such evi-
dence and to quantify how much of the difference reflects
observable versus unexplained factors.
Methods This study used the nationally representative HCUP
inpatient database from 2006 to 2013 for patients with a pri-
mary diagnosis of PAD who were either Caucasian, African-
American, or Hispanic. Multivariable logistic regression
models were estimated to identify the determinants of ampu-
tation rates.
Results Multivariable results revealed that African-Americans
and Hispanics are approximately twice as likely to be ampu-
tated as are Caucasians. Observed factors in the models col-
lectively account for 51 to 55 % of the disparities for African-
Americans and 64 to 69 % for Hispanics. The results suggest
that African-Americans and Hispanics have less access to
care, because they are being admitted when sicker and more
likely on an emergent basis.
Conclusions Racial and ethnic disparities in amputation rates
are substantial, with disease severity and hospital admission
source being key factors.

Introduction
Healthcare disparity is an active area of concern for
policymakers. Since the year 2000, the Department of
Health and Human Services’ Healthy People initiative
has included the elimination of health disparities as an
overarching goal. In Healthy People 2020, the stated goal
is to ‘achieve health equity, eliminate disparities, and im-
prove the health of all groups’ [1]. As reported in the 2014
National Healthcare Quality and Disparities report, signif-
icant disparities remain in many areas of healthcare access,
quality, and outcomes, including in measures of chronic
disease management [2].
Issues relating to racial and ethnic disparity in the treat-
ment, management, and outcomes for patients with peripheral
artery disease (PAD) and critical limb ischemia (CLI) have
been well documented since the 1990s [3, 4]. Compared to
Caucasian patients, several studies have found that African-
Americans with PAD are more likely to be amputated and less

 likely to have their lower limb revascularized either surgically
or via an endovascular approach [3–9]. In an early analysis of
data from acute-care hospitals in Florida, Huber et al. reported
that the incidence of amputation (5.0 vs. 2.5 per 10,000) was
higher and revascularization lower (4.0 vs. 7.1 per 10,000)
among African-Americans compared to Caucasians, even
though the incidence of any procedure for PAD was compa-
rable (9.0 vs. 9.6 per 10,000) [4]. Other studies have reported
that the probability of undergoing a revascularization or an-
gioplasty was reduced by 28–49 % among African-Americans
relative to Caucasians [3 6]. In a recent study that used multi-
ple logistic regression to control for confounding variables,
African-Americans were estimated to be at a 77 % higher risk
of lower extremity amputation versus revascularization when
compared to Caucasian patients [7]. In a multiple logistic re-
gression analysis of inpatient Medicare data (2003 through
2006), Holman et al., determined that African-Americans
diagnosed with PAD who had undergone a major lower
extremity amputation were also significantly less likely
than Caucasians to have undergone revascularization (28 %
less likely), limb-related admission (19 % less likely), or
wound debridement (20 % less likely) in the 2 years prior to
amputation in comparison to Caucasian amputees [10].
Newhall et al., using Medicare data (2007–2011), explored
geographic variation in amputation-free survival
postrevascularization (endovascular or open) for patients di-
agnosed with PAD and diabetes; amputation-free survival at
2 years ranged from 53.7 % in Savannah Georgia to 76.7 % in
Gary Indian for African-Americans and from 64.9 % in
Appleton Wisconsin to 83 % in Yakima Washington for
Caucasians [11]. Data summarized in a recent (2011) review
demonstrates that disparities in pre-amputation care, frequen-
cy of amputation in comparison to limb-salvaging procedures,
and level (above or below knee) of amputation in minorities as
compared to Caucasian patients persist [12]. While revascu-
larization procedures including endovascular interventions
have increased over the past two decades, significant racial
and ethnic disparities remain in the treatment of patients with
PAD and CLI [13].
A recent descriptive study demonstrated the low revascu-
larization and high amputation rates in PAD patients among
African-Americans and Hispanics compared to Caucasians on
a national level [13]. However, it did not provide multivariate
evidence to control for potential confounders, which could
bias the estimated associations between race and amputation
rates. It is plausible that commonly cited reasons, including
racial/ethnic variations in disease or comorbid distribution,
differential access to care, racial bias and/or patient prefer-
ences (e.g., distrust in the medical system by some in the
African-American community), and cultural and/or linguistic
barriers, could explain these ongoing disparities [13, 14].
While there is little literature available that explores these
underlying issues using multivariate methods, a recent study
by Durazzo et al. [7] highlights the complexity of this land-
scape. In a multivariate logistic regression analysis of NIS data
(2002-2008), Durazzo et al. found that the increased risk of
undergoing an amputation for an African-American in com-
parison to a Caucasian rose from 43 to 98 % with the increas-
ing revascularization capacity of the presenting hospital [7].
This seemingly paradoxical result indicates that access to hos-
pitals with greater capacity for limb-salvaging therapies in-
creased racial disparity in treatment. The authors also noted
that while the overall odds of being treated with revasculari-
zation rather than amputation increased with increasing mean
income of the patients’ zip code of residence, the rate of in-
crease was greater for Caucasians than for African-Americans,
resulting in increased disparity in relative amputation rates in
the wealthier zip codes.
The existing research does not support policy efforts aimed
at improving access to limb-saving treatment for African-
Americans and Hispanics because the individual importance
of these potential factors in explaining the disparities has not
been well quantified. Indeed, while the existence of racial and
ethnic disparities in amputation rates has been well document-
ed, there is a paucity of evidence that attempts to explain the
factors behind these disparities. Yet, such evidence is critical
from a policy perspective. For instance, it is important to know
whether differences in patient health, demographic character-
istics, health insurance status, or treatment setting are most
responsible for observed differences in revascularization and
amputation rates. Without such evidence, any future policy
efforts aimed at improving the quantity and quality of care
for minority Americans will be hampered.
The present study seeks to bridge several existing gaps in
the literature. First, we apply Blinder–Oaxaca decomposition
methods to identify and quantify specific factors accounting
for racial and ethnic disparities in amputation rates among
PAD patients [15, 16]. Second, we quantify the aggregate
effects of all observed factors (e.g., patient health, demograph-
ic characteristics, health insurance status, and treatment set-
ting) in explaining these disparities. Finally, we estimate how
much of the racial and ethnic disparities persist even after
accounting for a wide variety of observed factors. This will
highlight the limitations in the ability to reduce disparities by
affecting observable factors and the potential need to explore
other factors that may be more difficult to measure but are
nonetheless important in accounting for these differences.
Methods
This is a retrospective observational study, utilizing the
Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) national in-
patient database. Descriptive statistics by race were prepared
to summarize patient characteristics, comorbidities, and
sociodemographic factors for each inpatient visit with a
J. Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities (2017) 4:784–795
785
 primary diagnosis of PAD. Primary outcomes of interest for
this analysis were amputation and revascularization.
Data Source
Patient visits in the HCUP database from 2006 to 2013, the
largest all-payer inpatient care database in the USA, were
assessed for eligibility. This database contains data from a
family of healthcare databases and related software tools and
products developed through a Federal-State-Industry partner-
ship and sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research
and Quality (AHRQ).
HCUP databases combine the data collection efforts of
State organizations, hospital associations, private data organi-
zations, and the Federal government to create a national infor-
mation resource of patient-level healthcare data. The HCUP is
the largest publicly available all-payer inpatient healthcare
database in the USA, yielding national estimates of hospital
inpatient stays. Unweighted, it contains data from more than 7
million hospital stays each year. Weighted, it estimates more
than 36 million hospitalizations nationally [17]. The HCUP
database enables research on a broad range of health econom-
ics and policy issues, including cost and quality of health
services, medical practice patterns, access to healthcare pro-
grams, and outcomes of treatments at the national level.
Study Population
Selection criteria for this study were designed to be as broad as
possible while maximizing the likelihood that patients are
accurately characterized with respect to having PAD.
Inpatient visits meeting the following criteria were eligible
for inclusion in the study: (1) patient visits must have a pri-
mary diagnosis of PAD (see Online Resource A for complete
list of ICD-9 codes); (2) race or ethnic background of interest
must be reported; and (3) the patient visit cannot contain a
diagnosis for a Btraumatic^ amputation of a limb: 895.x,
896.x, 897.x.
There are three patient cohorts of interest for this analysis:
Caucasians, African-Americans, and Hispanics. Although
HCUP categories included Native Americans, Asian or
Pacific Islanders, and other, our study restricts the sample to
the three main race/ethnic cohorts as stated above. HCUP
coding combines race and ethnicity in one data element. If
the source supplied race and ethnicity in separate data ele-
ments, ethnicity took precedence over race in setting the
HCUP value for race. Thus, a patient that was African-
American and Hispanic would be counted as Hispanic. Not
all state data sources provide information on race and ethnic-
ity. Only hospital visits that had race/ethnicity measures of
interest were utilized for this analysis.
Variable Definitions
Outcome variables used in this analysis included amputation
and revascularization procedures. Leg amputations were cat-
egorized as follows: any amputation (any part of the leg or
foot) or lower leg amputation (below the knee, ankle, foot, or
toe). Revascularization was defined as patient visits with a
record of the following procedures: peripheral artery bypass
graft, peripheral artery angioplasty, peripheral artery stenting,
or atherectomy.
Using these criteria for amputation and revasculariza-
tion, we constructed four outcome variables to investi-
gate the robustness of the results to alternative measures.
The first two examine whether a patient received any leg
amputation (including lower and upper leg) or whether
the patient received a lower leg amputation (e.g., below
the knee). Patients receiving no amputation formed the
reference cohort in each case. The second set of outcome
variables were restricted to patients who either received
an amputation or revascularization procedure. In this
case, we wished to examine potential disparities among
patients who received amputation or revascularization;
hence, medically managed patients were excluded from
these outcomes. Thus, we constructed a variable measur-
ing whether a patient received an amputation or revascu-
larization procedure at any leg site (e.g., including lower
and upper leg) and a corresponding variable indicating
whether a patient received amputation or revasculariza-
tion at a lower limb site. The precise definitions of these
variables are provided in the legend to Table 5.
Covariates considered for this analysis include patient
demographics (age, gender, health insurance type, and in-
come); hospital visit characteristics (such as admission
type, day of week, and number of procedures performed);
diagnosis-related group (DRG)-defined disease severity
and mortality risk; comorbidities (AHRQ-determined co-
morbidity measures and calcium risk factors); hospital
characteristics (bed size, teaching status, Census Region,
urban–rural location); and year of observation.
Comorbidity measures were assigned using the AHRQ
comorbidity software. The AHRQ comorbidity measures
identified coexisting medical conditions that were not di-
rectly related to the principal diagnosis or the main reason
for admission and were likely to have originated prior to
the hospital stay. Comorbidities were identified using
ICD-9-CM diagnoses and the DRG in effect on the dis-
charge date.
Statistical Analyses
Continuous variables were summarized by the mean and stan-
dard deviation. Categorical variables were summarized with
counts and percentages. Summary data tables were generated
786

 by race for the following: patient demographics, hospital visit
characteristics, patient comorbidities and risk factors, hospital
characteristics, and amputation and revascularization out-
comes of interest.
The research relies on the well-known Blinder–Oaxaca
decomposition method to ascertain and quantify the fac-
tors that contribute to the racial/ethnic disparities in the
treatment of PAD patients [15, 16]. This approach, which
originated in labor economics [15, 16], has been increas-
ingly applied in recent years to better understand the
determinants of racial and ethnic disparities in healthcare
utilization, treatment patterns, and outcomes [18]. The
decomposition method proceeds by estimating separate
equations for amputation rates for each racial cohort of
interest. We first compared Caucasians and African-
Americans and then Caucasians and Hispanics by esti-
mating logistic regressions predicting amputation rates as

Equation 1 predicts the likelihood of having an ampu-
tation among African-Americans, Eq. 2 predicts the like-
lihood of having an amputation among Hispanics, and
Eq. 3 predicts the likelihood of this outcome for
Caucasian patients. The βs are coefficients to be estimat-
ed, and X1 and X2 are explanatory variables predicting
the likelihood of getting an amputation in these simple
models.
Using the results from these models, one may decom-
pose the difference in the mean likelihood of getting an
amputation between African-Americans and Caucasians
as well as between Hispanics and Caucasians into two
components. The first component depicts differences in
the values of the estimated coefficients (e.g., βs). The
second component depicts differences in the levels of the
explanatory variables (e.g., the Xs). Using this procedure,
one can estimate not only the mean overall difference in
the likelihood of amputation by race, but how much of
the difference is due to racial differences in the values of
the explanatory variables and how much reflects racial
differences in how each group responds to those vari-
ables (e.g., racial differences in the values of the estimat-
ed βs). Changes due to values in the Xs are interpreted as
observed differences while changes in the βs are due to
unobserved factors. This technique has useful public pol-
icy implications because it can inform how much of the
differences in amputation rates reflect differences in ob-
servable levels of explanatory variables and the relative
importance of each one of those variables in affecting the
disparity.
Results
For all patient visits meeting the inclusion criteria, there were
143,993 Caucasians, 34,612 African-Americans, and 15,277
Hispanics (see Fig. 1 for full attrition diagram). Patient demo-
graphics by race are illustrated in Table 1. Caucasians are
generally older, wealthier, and less likely to have Medicaid
insurance than are either African-Americans or Hispanics.
African-Americans are more likely to be female than are either
Caucasians or Hispanics.
Table 2 describes multiple serious issues that could explain
the worse outcomes and higher amputation rates for African-
Americans and Hispanics. Caucasians are more likely to
schedule an elective procedure. African-Americans and
Hispanics were more likely to present to the emergency
department (ED) for PAD, which is consistent with waiting
too long for treatment. Caucasians are more likely to be
admitted on weekdays than are either African-Americans
or Hispanics. The mean number of chronic conditions is
slightly lower for Caucasian than for African-Americans or
Hispanics.
Table 3 shows a broad summary of the comorbidities that
tend to be associated with poor PAD outcomes. Patient co-
morbidities and risk factors reveal that African-Americans and
Hispanics are at substantially higher risk of mortality than are
Caucasians. African-Americans and Hispanics have more se-
vere disease as measured by DRG severity and are more likely
to have anemia, hypertension, and diabetes than are
Caucasians. But Caucasians are more likely to have chronic
pulmonary diseases and to be smokers. Regarding geograph-
ical differences, African-Americans are more likely to be lo-
cated in the South with Hispanics more likely to be located in
the West than are Caucasians. Racial and ethnic differences by
hospital characteristics are relatively minor (Table 4).
Table 5 displays all outcome variables by race. This reveals
substantial racial and ethnic disparities. In particular, African-
Americans are approximately twice as likely to be amputated
as are Caucasians, and Hispanics are about 50 % more likely
to be amputated.
Results of multivariable models comparing African-
Americans to Caucasians are provided in Table 6. In the in-
terest of brevity, Table 6 only reports those explanatory vari-
ables that contributed 5 % or more in terms of accounting for
the disparities. Tables showing the effects of all explanatory
variables are available from the authors on request. The results
in Table 6 indicate that amputation rates remain twice as high
for African-Americans compared to Caucasians. Moreover,
for African-Americans, observed factors (e.g., all of the vari-
ables in the models) collectively account for about 50 to 55 %
of the disparities in amputation rates. The most important in-
dividual factors accounting for these differences are higher
mortality risk and disease severity among African-
Americans and a higher chance of ED admission. This

 suggests that African-Americans have less access to
care, because they are being admitted when sicker and
more likely on an emergent basis. The corresponding
results comparing Hispanics and Caucasians are given
in Table 7.
Hispanics are about 50 % more likely to be amputat-
ed than are Caucasians. This result is consistent across
amputation measures. For Hispanics, observed factors
(e.g., all of the variables in the models) collectively
account for about 64 to 69 % of the disparities in am-
putation rates, which are significantly higher among
Hispanics, though not so high as for African-
Americans. The most important individual factors ac-
counting for these differences are higher mortality risk
and disease severity among Hispanics, a higher chance
of ED admission, higher prevalence of diabetes, and
anemia. This suggests that, like African-Americans,
Hispanics have less access to care, because they are
being admitted when sicker and more likely on an
emergent basis. Observed factors explain more of the
disparities between Caucasians and Hispanics (64 to
69 %) than between African-Americans and Hispanics
(51 to 55 %). Still, there is a substantial portion left
unexplained.
Discussion
Persistent racial and ethnic disparities in access to care and
medical treatment of PAD/CLI have been well documented in
the literature [3–13, 18–20]. Understanding the reasons for
such differences and their relative importance is critical for
informing policies aimed at reducing or eliminating such dis-
parities. Yet, there is far less evidence on this important ave-
nue of research. This study has sought to help bridge this gap
with respect to PAD treatment.
Consistent with prior research, we find substantial dispar-
ities in PAD-related treatment patterns between African-
Americans and Hispanics compared to Caucasians. Using four
measures of leg amputation rates, we find that African-
Americans are amputated at twice the rate of Caucasians in

 every case. Hispanics are amputated at a rate 50 % higher than
are Caucasians.
As healthcare providers, we are striving to uncover fixable
causes of the lack of fair care to racial and ethnic minority
patients. The discrepancies in care led this group to further
investigate the root cause of the sustained increased amputa-
tion rates among African-Americans and Hispanics. We find
evidence suggesting that Caucasians are accessing advanced
care in the earlier stages of their disease. In particular, an
examination of individual factors associated with these differ-
ences finds that being sicker (e.g., higher mortality risk and
disease severity) and being admitted through the ED as op-
posed to direct inpatient admission are the most important
individual factors explaining these differences. These factors

 reflect, in turn, less access to care overall. Patients who have
less access will generally present in worse health and are more
likely to go to the ED for their care. Thus, we find that less
access translates into substantially different treatment patterns,
with minorities with PAD receiving much higher amputation
rates.
Yet, much of the variation remains unexplained. It is strik-
ing that despite specifying quite detailed models, which in-
clude a wide variety of patient demographics, comorbidities,
hospital characteristics, regional characteristics, and so on,
about 50 % of the disparity in amputation rates between
African-Americans and Caucasians remains unexplained and
approximately 30 % of the variation between Hispanics and
Caucasians.
What factors could account for such unexplained differ-
ences? While it is possible that some critical patient, demo-
graphic, or hospital characteristics have been omitted from our
models, this seems an unlikely explanation, given the rich set
of factors that we were able to control for. Moreover, it would
be quite surprising if adding more of such variables were able
to account for a full half of the disparity, as would be required
to explain all of the disparities between African-Americans
and Caucasians.
A second possibility is that treatment preferences differ by
race and ethnicity. For this to be true, however, African-
Americans and Hispanics would need to have a greater pref-
erence for leg amputation rather than revascularization or
medical management compared to their Caucasian counter-
parts. We are aware of no study that has formally investigated
this issue, but this, too, seems unpersuasive. Simply put, most
people of any race would likely wish to avoid amputation if
medically possible.
A third possibility is that African-Americans and Hispanics
are being systematically treated differently—in terms of hav-
ing higher amputation rates—even after controlling for a wide
variety of patient, demographic, and hospital characteristics.
This phenomenon, known as statistical discrimination, has
received growing attention in the medical literature [21–23].
It is based upon Bayesian decision theory. According to this
theory, physicians decide upon a course of treatment based on

 their perception of an individual patient’s likely candidacy for
that treatment and the past course of treatment for patients
sharing similar characteristics such as race. If—perhaps be-
cause of poorer communication with their minority patients—
physicians have less information about their individual health
states and likelihood of responding to a specific treatment,
they will place greater weight on the treatment patterns re-
ceived in the past by that group. And if those past treatment
patterns called for relatively high amputation rates—as in the
case of minorities—the pattern gets repeated. Of note in this
regard, Newhall et al. [11] find that, among PAD patients who
had been revascularized, African-Americans were significant-
ly more likely to require subsequent amputation than their
Caucasian counterparts were. Perhaps a prior belief that
long-term outcomes are on average worse for revascularized
African-Americans leads to more aggressive amputation rates
for this group. In any event, statistical discrimination provides
a plausible explanation for the large unexplained disparities in
amputation rates between Caucasians and minority patients
that warrants further study.
Moreover, statistical discrimination helps explain seeming-
ly paradoxical results regarding racial and ethnic disparities in
amputation rates that have been reported in the literature.
Thus, Durazzo et al. [7] report that racial and ethnic disparities
increase among hospitals where revascularization capabilities
are greatest. The paradox here is that greater availability of
revascularization exacerbates the disparities. Seen through the
lens of statistical discrimination, however, this finding be-
comes less surprising. First, among hospitals having little or
no ability to revascularize, amputation rates should be similar

 since revascularization is not a viable alternative. In this case,
statistical discrimination—systematically revascularizing
Caucasians more than minorities—is not possible. But when
revascularization is readily available, physicians can statisti-
cally discriminate, and Durazzo et al. find that Caucasians are
substantially less likely to get amputated.
Research has demonstrated that patient–physician commu-
nication with African-Americans differs significantly from
their Caucasian counterparts:
Physicians were 23 % more verbally dominant and en-
gaged in 33 % less patient-centered communication
with African American patients than with White pa-
tients. Furthermore, both African American patients
and their physicians exhibited lower levels of positive
affect than White patients and their physicians did [24].
Moreover, poor communication between physicians
and their minority patients has been cited as a potentially
important factor contributing to racial and ethnic dispar-
ities in other contexts [25, 26]. Kwolek et al. [27] argue
that a more diverse vascular surgery workforce is needed
to help address racial and ethnic disparities in treatment
patterns. Greater diversity should help to improve physi-
cian–patient communication. As statistical discrimination
is itself likely rooted in a lack of communication be-
tween physicians and their minority patients, the poten-
tial for improved communication to reduce disparities in
amputation rates would seem to be quite large. While
these are intriguing possibilities, the actual extent to
which statistical discrimination affects differences in
PAD treatment patterns requires further research.
Study Limitations
This study has some limitations that must be acknowl-
edged. One limitation common to all retrospective re-
search is the lack of an experimental design. But
HCUP data have been widely used to evaluate the asso-
ciation between treatments and clinical outcomes, which
is particularly valuable when a portrayal of patient expe-
rience outside the controlled setting of the clinical trial is
desired. Because HCUP includes a rich variety of vari-
ables, including patient demographic characteristics,

 comorbid conditions, and hospital characteristics, we be-
lieve that important confounding factors may be con-
trolled for, resulting in reliable estimates of the impacts
of race and ethnicity on the outcomes of interest.
Moreover, both discharge and hospital weights are avail-
able in HCUP, enabling one to generate nationally repre-
sentative effects of race and ethnicity on these outcomes.
But while our analysis has identified factors associated
with racial and ethnic disparities in amputation rates, our
lack of an experimental design precludes making causal
inferences. Another limitation is that our inclusion
criteria to identify PAD candidates for amputation or re-
vascularization were based on a primary diagnosis code
for PAD. It is possible that some of these patients were
not candidates for any invasive treatment despite having
this primary diagnosis. Finally, while statistical discrimi-
nation provides a plausible explanation for the unex-
plained racial and ethnic differences in amputation rates,
this must be viewed with caution as it is possible that
other factors may be at work as well.
Conclusion
Racial and ethnic disparities in amputation rates are substan-
tial, with disease severity and hospital admission source being
key factors. As the population ages and comorbidities rise,
these disparities may accelerate unless access among minori-
ties improves. Moreover, because some 30 to 50 % of these
disparities remain unexplained by access or other observed
factors, substantial disparities could persist despite improve-
ments in access. Identifying the precise factors causing these
large unexplained variations is an important direction for fur-
ther study.
