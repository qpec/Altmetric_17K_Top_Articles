ance. The USPSTF does not consider the costs of providing a ser-
vice in this assessment.

Summary of Recommendation and Evidence
The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to
assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for atrial
fibrillation with electrocardiography (ECG) (I statement) (Figure 1).
Rationale
Importance
Atrial fibrillation is the most common type of cardiac arrhythmia
(ie, irregular heartbeat), and its prevalence increases with age, af-
fectingabout3%ofmenand2%ofwomenaged65to69yearsand
IMPORTANCE Atrial fibrillation is the most common type of cardiac arrhythmia (irregular
heartbeat), and its prevalence increases with age, affecting about 3% of men and 2% of
women aged 65 to 69 years and about 10% of adults 85 years and older. Atrial fibrillation
is a major risk factor for ischemic stroke, increasing risk of stroke by as much as 5-fold.
Approximately 20% of patients who have a stroke associated with atrial fibrillation
are first diagnosed with atrial fibrillation at the time of stroke or shortly thereafter.
OBJECTIVE To issue a new US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on
screening for atrial fibrillation with electrocardiography (ECG).
EVIDENCE REVIEW The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on the benefits and harms of
screening for atrial fibrillation with ECG in adults 65 years and older, the effectiveness
of screening with ECG for detecting previously undiagnosed atrial fibrillation compared
with usual care, and the benefits and harms of anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy
for the treatment of screen-detected atrial fibrillation in older adults.
FINDINGS Most older adults with previously undiagnosed atrial fibrillation have a stroke risk
above the threshold for anticoagulant therapy and would be eligible for treatment.
Anticoagulant therapy is effective for stroke prevention in symptomatic persons with atrial
fibrillation and high stroke risk. However, the USPSTF found inadequate evidence to
determine whether screening with ECG and subsequent treatment in asymptomatic adults
is more effective than usual care. At the same time, the harms of diagnostic follow-up and
treatment prompted by abnormal ECG results are well established and include misdiagnosis
and invasive testing. Given these uncertainties, it is not possible to determine the net benefit
of screening with ECG.
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATION The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence
is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for atrial fibrillation
with ECG. (I statement)

 about 10% of adults 85 years and older. Atrial fibrillation is a major
risk factor for ischemic stroke, increasing risk of stroke by as much
as 5-fold. Approximately 20% of patients who have a stroke asso-
ciated with atrial fibrillation are first diagnosed with atrial fibrilla-
tion at the time of stroke or shortly thereafter.
Detection
The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to assess whether screen-
ingwithECGidentifiesadults65yearsandolderwithpreviouslyun-
diagnosed atrial fibrillation more effectively than usual care.
Benefits of Early Detection and Intervention and Treatment
The USPSTF found inadequate evidence directly assessing the
benefit of screening for atrial fibrillation with ECG on clinical out-
comes. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that treatment
with anticoagulant therapy reduces the incidence of stroke in
patients with symptomatic atrial fibrillation. Given the inadequate
evidence on screening with ECG for the detection of atrial fibrilla-
tion in asymptomatic adults, there is inadequate evidence to
determine the magnitude of benefit of screening with ECG fol-
lowed by treatment.

The USPSTF recommends the service. There is high certainty that the net benefit is moderate, or
there is moderate certainty that the net benefit is moderate to substantial.
Offer or provide this service.
C
The USPSTF recommends selectively offering or providing this service to individual patients

that the net benefit is small.
Offer or provide this service for selected
patients depending on individual
circumstances.
D
The USPSTF recommends against the service. There is moderate or high certainty that the service
has no net benefit or that the harms outweigh the benefits.
Discourage the use of this service.
I statement
The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits
and harms of the service. Evidence is lacking, of poor quality, or conflicting, and the balance of
benefits and harms cannot be determined.
Read the Clinical Considerations section
of the USPSTF Recommendation
Statement. If the service is offered,
patients should understand the
uncertainty about the balance of benefits
and harms.
USPSTF Levels of Certainty Regarding Net Benefit
Level of Certainty
Description
High
The available evidence usually includes consistent results from well-designed, well-conducted studies in representative primary care
populations. These studies assess the effects of the preventive service on health outcomes. This conclusion is therefore unlikely to be
strongly affected by the results of future studies.
Moderate
The available evidence is sufficient to determine the effects of the preventive service on health outcomes, but confidence in the estimate
is constrained by such factors as 
the number, size, or quality of individual studies.
inconsistency of findings across individual studies.
limited generalizability of findings to routine primary care practice.
lack of coherence in the chain of evidence.
As more information becomes available, the magnitude or direction of the observed effect could change, and this change may be large
enough to alter the conclusion.
The USPSTF defines certainty as “likelihood that the USPSTF assessment of the net benefit of a preventive service is correct.” The net benefit is defined as
benefit minus harm of the preventive service as implemented in a general, primary care population. The USPSTF assigns a certainty level based on the nature
of the overall evidence available to assess the net benefit of a preventive service.
Low
The available evidence is insufficient to assess effects on health outcomes. Evidence is insufficient because of
the limited number or size of studies.
important flaws in study design or methods.
inconsistency of findings across individual studies.
gaps in the chain of evidence.
findings not generalizable to routine primary care practice.
lack of information on important health outcomes.
More information may allow estimation of effects on health outcomes.

mine the balance of benefits and harms of screening for atrial fibril-
lationwithECGinasymptomaticadults.Evidenceislacking,andthe
balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined.
Clinical Considerations
Patient Population Under Consideration
This recommendation applies to older adults (65 years and older)
without symptoms of atrial fibrillation (Figure 2).
Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement
Potential Preventable Burden
Atrialfibrillationisthemostcommontypeofcardiacarrhythmia,af-
fectingmorethan2.7millionindividualsintheUnitedStates.1Atrial
fibrillation is strongly associated with older age (eg, prevalence in-
creasesfrom0.2%amongadults<55yearsto10%amongthose�85
years)andobesity,bothofwhichareincreasingintheUnitedStates.2
Other risk factors include high blood pressure, diabetes, heart fail-
ure,priorcardiothoracicsurgery,currentsmoking,priorstroke,sleep
apnea, alcohol and drug use, and hyperthyroidism.
Electrocardiography, the intervention considered for this rec-
ommendation, records the electrical activity of the heart using
electrodes (or leads) placed on the skin. It can be measured with
12 leads, fewer than 12 leads, or a single handheld lead. One sys-
tematic review reported a 93% sensitivity and 97% specificity for
12-lead ECG; individual studies in the review reported sensitivity
ranging from 68% to 100% and specificity ranging from 76% to
100%.3 In addition, several medical devices (eg, automatic blood
pressure cuffs and pulse oximeters) are being designed to detect
an irregular heartbeat, and an increasing number of consumer
devices (eg, wearable monitors and smartphones) have the capa-
bility to assess heart rhythm.4
Pulse palpation and heart auscultation can also detect atrial
fibrillation. In the systematic review discussed above, pulse palpa-
tion was reported to have relatively good sensitivity (point esti-
mate,0.87-1.00)butlowerspecificitythanECG(pointestimate,0.77-
0.84)fordetectingatrialfibrillation.3However,toaddressthislower
specificity, confirmatory ECG can be readily performed in practice
in response to an irregular pulse.
Without treatment with anticoagulant therapy, patients with
atrial fibrillation have an approximately 5-fold increased risk of
stroke, and strokes associated with atrial fibrillation tend to be
more severe than strokes attributed to other causes.5 Approxi-
mately one-third of patients with atrial fibrillation who have a
stroke die within the year, and up to 30% of survivors have some
type of permanent disability.6 Atrial fibrillation does not always
cause noticeable symptoms, and some persons may not be aware

Atrial fibrillation is strongly associated with older age and obesity. Other risk factors include high blood pressure, diabetes, heart
failure, prior cardiothoracic surgery, current smoking, prior stroke, sleep apnea, alcohol and drug use, and hyperthyroidism.
The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to assess whether screening with electrocardiography identifies older adults with
previously undiagnosed atrial fibrillation more effectively than usual care.
Treatments and
Interventions
Treatment of atrial fibrillation has 2 components: managing arrhythmia and preventing stroke. In general, these treatment goals
are independent of each other. Arrhythmia can be managed by controlling the heart rate to minimize symptoms (usually through
medication) or by restoring a normal rhythm. Treatment with anticoagulant therapy reduces the incidence of stroke in patients
with symptomatic atrial fibrillation and high stroke risk.
The USPSTF has made recommendations on many factors related to stroke prevention, including screening for high blood pressure,
use of statins, counseling on smoking cessation, counseling to promote healthful diet and physical activity, and use of low-dose aspirin
for certain persons at increased risk of cardiovascular disease.

 that they have it. For approximately 20% of patients who have a
stroke associated with atrial fibrillation, stroke is the first sign that
they have the condition.7 If persons with undiagnosed atrial fibril-
lation could be detected earlier and start preventive therapy ear-
lier, some of these strokes might be avoided.
Potential Harms
TheperformanceofECGitselfisnotassociatedwithsignificantharm,
although abnormal results may cause anxiety. Misinterpretation of
ECG results may lead to misdiagnosis and unnecessary treatment.
Treatment of atrial fibrillation includes anticoagulant therapy for
stroke prevention, which is associated with a risk of bleeding, and
pharmacologic, surgical, endovascular (eg, ablation), or combined
treatments to control heart rhythm or heart rate. In addition, ECG
may detect other abnormalities (either true- or false-positive re-
sults) that can lead to invasive confirmatory testing and treat-
ments that have the potential for serious harm. For example, angi-
ography and revascularization are associated with risks, including
bleeding, contrast-induced nephropathy, and allergic reactions to
the contrast agent.
Current Practice
Few data are available on the current prevalence of screening for
atrial fibrillation with ECG or the frequency with which pulse palpa-
tion or heart auscultation are performed in the United States.
Treatment and Interventions
Treatment of atrial fibrillation has 2 components—managing
arrhythmia and preventing stroke. In general, these treatment
goals are independent of each other, because even restoring sinus
rhythm does not necessarily reduce stroke risk enough to change
how anticoagulant therapy is managed, given the potential for sub-
sequent recurrence of atrial fibrillation. Arrhythmia can be man-
aged by controlling the heart rate to minimize symptoms (usually
through medication) or by restoring a normal rhythm. Methods for
restoring normal rhythm include electrical or pharmacologic cardio-
version and surgical or catheter ablation. Some evidence suggests
that selected patients may be able to reverse atrial fibrillation
through lifestyle changes that address the underlying causes of
atrial fibrillation.8 Stroke risk for persons with nonvalvular atrial
fibrillation can be estimated with tools such as CHADS2 (congestive
heart failure, hypertension, age �75 years, diabetes mellitus, prior
stroke or transient ischemic attack or thromboembolism
[doubled]) (developed by Gage and colleagues, Washington Uni-
versity School of Medicine) or its updated version, CHA2DS2-VASc
(congestive heart failure, hypertension, age �75 years [doubled],
diabetes, stroke/transient ischemic attack/thromboembolism
[doubled], vascular disease [prior myocardial infarction, peripheral
artery disease, or aortic plaque], age 65-74 years, sex category
[female]) (Lip and colleagues, University of Birmingham Centre for
Cardiovascular Sciences). These tools use somewhat different com-
binations of patient characteristics and presence or absence of
comorbid conditions, as outlined above, to estimate annual risk
of stroke and guide decisions about anticoagulation therapy.
For patients with atrial fibrillation and high stroke risk (defined as
a CHA2DS2-VASc score of �2), this risk can be reduced with antico-
agulant therapy—either vitamin K antagonists (eg, warfarin) or,
more recently, non–vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants.
A device that blocks off the atrial appendage to prevent blood clots
has also been recently approved by the US Food and Drug Adminis-
tration as a nonpharmacologic alternative to anticoagulant therapy
for selected patients.

Other Considerations
Research Needs and Gaps
The connection between atrial fibrillation and stroke is well estab-
lished, as is the existence of undiagnosed atrial fibrillation, espe-
cially among older adults. Randomized trials enrolling asymptom-
atic persons that directly compare screening with usual care and
that assess both health outcomes and harms are needed to under-
stand the balance of benefits and harms of screening for atrial fibril-
lation. Other research needs include understanding how to best
optimize the accuracy of ECG interpretation. Although the evi-
dence review for this recommendation statement focused on
screening with ECG, the effectiveness of newer technologies
capable of assessing pulse and heart rhythm as potential screening
strategies should be evaluated. In addition, as ECG and other tech-
nologies (eg, AliveCOR Kardia system [AliveCor Inc], discussed in
the context of the REHEARSE-AF trial below) are used to record
heart activity for longer periods and thus are able to detect shorter
episodes of arrhythmia, understanding the stroke risk associated
with brief episodes of subclinical atrial fibrillation, and the potential
benefit of anticoagulation therapy if risk is significant, is another
important research need.
Several ongoing trials may help to fill these evidence gaps. The
STROKESTOP study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01593553)
randomized 28 768 Swedish adults aged 75 to 76 years to be
invited or not invited for screening, first with 12-lead ECG and
then intermittently with a single handheld lead over 2 weeks.
The primary outcome is stroke incidence. The SCREEN-AF study
(ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02392754) randomized
more than 800 participants to a 2-week ambulatory ECG patch
monitor or usual care. The primary outcome is new diagnosis
of ECG-confirmed atrial fibrillation or flutter, but clinical events
are included as secondary outcomes. The IDEAL-MD study
(ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02270151) randomized 16 000
adults older than 65 years to screening with a single-lead ECG
device or usual care. The primary outcome is new diagnosis of
atrial fibrillation over 1 year; secondary outcomes include major

 cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality. Last, the Detecting
and Diagnosing Atrial Fibrillation (D2AF) study (Netherlands Trial
Register No. NTR4914) is a cluster randomized trial that compares
different approaches to case-finding among adults 65 years and
older. The primary outcome is the difference in detection rate of
new atrial fibrillation cases over 1 year compared with usual care;
however, the study does not include clinical outcomes.

persistent and permanent atrial fibrillation have the highest stroke

counts for 25% of all cases, increases the incidence of stroke.17
Scope of Review
The USPSTF commissioned a systematic review7,18 to evaluate the
evidence on the benefits and harms of screening for atrial fibrilla-
tionwithECGinolderadults,theeffectivenessofscreeningwithECG
fordetectingpreviouslyundiagnosedatrialfibrillationcomparedwith
usual care (including prompted pulse palpation), and the benefits
and harms of anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy for the treat-
ment of screen-detected atrial fibrillation in older adults.
Detection of Previously Undiagnosed Atrial Fibrillation
Three fair-quality randomized clinical trials in the United Kingdom
assessed screening for atrial fibrillation with ECG. The first study
randomized 3001 patients (mean age, 75 years) to prompted pulse
palpation (clinicians and nurses were encouraged to record the
patient’
s pulse and follow up an irregular pulse with 12-lead ECG;
this strategy was termed “
opportunistic screening”in this study
and in the SAFE study, below) or systematic screening (invitation to
attend nurse-led screening with pulse palpation and single-lead
ECG).19 The study found no statistically significant difference
between systematic screening with ECG and prompted pulse pal-
pation (risk difference, 0.003 [95% CI, −0.002 to 0.009]),
although there were few cases of atrial fibrillation and the confi-
dence interval was wide.
The second study (Screening for Atrial Fibrillation in the
Elderly [SAFE]) randomized 50 primary care practices (N = 14 802;
mean age, 75 years) to usual care or intervention; patients in the
intervention practices were randomized to prompted pulse palpa-
tion (clinicians and nurses were encouraged to check the patient’
s
pulse and follow up an irregular pulse with 12-lead ECG) or system-
atic screening with ECG (invitation to attend nurse-led screening
with pulse palpation and 12-lead ECG).20-24 The SAFE study found
that both prompted pulse palpation and systematic screening
increased detection of atrial fibrillation by 0.6% over baseline
prevalence but found no difference between prompted pulse pal-
pation and systematic screening in the detection of new cases.20
The study reported that 29% of cases detected with prompted
pulse palpation and 43% of cases detected with systematic screen-
ing had a CHADS2 score of 2 or greater and thus would be eligible
for anticoagulant therapy for stroke prevention.21 The SAFE study
also reported subgroup analyses by age and sex. Age had no
effect on detection rates; however, while both prompted pulse
palpation and systematic screening significantly increased the
odds of detecting atrial fibrillation among men (odds ratio, 2.33
[95% CI, 1.30-4.15] and odds ratio, 2.68 [95% CI, 1.52-4.73], respec-
tively), neither screening approach improved detection rates
among women.7
The SAFE study also assessed the accuracy of diagnosis by
comparing ECG interpretation at primary care clinics with a refer-
ence standard consisting of 2 cardiologists assigned to interpret
the same results (with a third cardiologist as arbitrator of any dis-
agreements). The primary care clinics, which had general practi-
tioners reading 12-lead ECG results, had relatively low sensitivity
(79.8% [95% CI, 70.5-87.2]) and specificity (91.6% [95% CI, 90.1-
93.1]); sinus rhythm was misinterpreted as atrial fibrillation in 114
of 1355 cases.23 Adding a computer algorithm improved the sensi-
tivity of primary care clinic readings from 80% to 92% but did not
affect specificity.22
The third study, Assessment of Remote Heart Rhythm Sam-
pling Using the AliveCor Heart Monitor to Screen for Atrial Fibrilla-
tion (REHEARSE-AF), randomized 1001 participants (mean age, 73
years) with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 2 or greater to systematic,

onds (plus additional recordings if symptoms occurred) over 12

sonswithsymptomssuggestiveofatrialfibrillationatbaseline.The
study found that more new cases of atrial fibrillation were de-
tected in the screening group than in the no screening group (19 vs
5cases;hazardratio,3.9[95%CI1.4-10.4]).Allnewdiagnosesofatrial
fibrillation were confirmed by a study cardiologist.

Most cases (12/19) detected in the screening group were paroxys-

diagnosed in the control group.

The USPSTF found 1 randomized clinical trial that reported clinical
outcomesfromascreeningprogramtodetectatrialfibrillationusing

strokes or transient ischemic attacks in the ECG screening and con-
trolgroups(6vs10cases;P = .34);however,thisstudywasnotpow-
ered to detect differences in clinical outcomes.25

Response to Public Comment
A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for
public comment on the USPSTF website from December 19, 2017,
to January 22, 2018. In response to comments, the USPSTF clari-
fied the intervention (screening with ECG) and comparison groups
(usual care, including prompted pulse palpation) considered for
this recommendation. The USPSTF also added the REHEARSE-AF
study to the “Discussion”section and added the need to under-
stand the stroke risk associated with brief episodes of atrial fibrilla-
tion to the “Research Needs and Gaps”section. In response to re-
quests that the USPSTF not exclude studies of persons with heart
failure or with implantable cardiac devices, the USPSTF notes that
itischargedwithevaluatingthebenefitsandharmsofscreeningand
clinical preventive services in generally healthy, asymptomatic per-
sons. Last, the USPSTF added the guidelines of the European Soci-
ety of Cardiology to the “Recommendations of Others”section.
Recommendations of Others
In 2014, the American Heart Association and the American Stroke
Association stated that active screening for atrial fibrillation in the
primarycaresettingamongpersonsolderthan65yearsusingpulse
assessment followed by ECG, as indicated, can be useful.27 The
EuropeanSocietyofCardiologyrecommendsopportunisticscreen-
ing by pulse palpation or an ECG rhythm strip in persons older than
65 years and recommends considering systematic screening to de-
tect atrial fibrillation in persons older than 75 years or those at high
risk of stroke.28
