Summary
Background: The impact of vitamin D status on body
composition is not well understood.
Objectives: Evaluate how vitamin D supplementation in
infancy affects body composition at 3 years of age.
Methods: Double-blind randomized trial of 132, 1-month-old
healthy, breastfed infants randomly assigned to receive oral
vitamin D3 supplements of 400, 800, 1200 or 1600IUd�1 for
11months. In the present analysis, 87 (66%) returned at 3years
of age. Body composition was measured using dual-energy
x-ray absorptiometry and plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)
D] concentrations by liquid chromatography tandem mass
spectrometry.
Results: Anthropometry, body composition, diet, activity
and demographics were similar across dosage groups at
3 years. Mean 25(OH)D concentration from 1 month to 3 years
was higher (P <0.001) in the 1200 IU group than 800 and
400IU groups. Children with 25(OH)D concentrations above
75nmol L�1 had lower fat mass (~450 g; P =0.049). In multi-
ple linear regression, mean 25(OH)D was associated with lean
mass percent (β =0.06; CI: 0.00, 0.12; P= 0.042), fat mass
(β = �11.29; CI: �22.06, �0.52; P =0.048) and body fat
percent (β =�0.06; CI: �0.12, �0.01; P= 0.045).
Conclusions: Higher vitamin D status from infancy through
to 3 years of age associates with leaner body composition.
Keywords: 25-hydroxyvitamin D, dose response, fat mass,
lean muscle mass, paediatrics.
Introduction
Circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concen-
trations positively associate with lean body composi-
tion in infants (1) and adolescents (2). Correcting
vitamin D deficiency in pre-pubertal girls increased
lean mass compared with placebo (3). Whether
vitamin D positively relates to lean body composition
in younger children is unknown. Addressing this
knowledge gap could improve understanding of the
nutritional and environmental factors associated with
healthy growth and body composition from birth to
early childhood (4).
Vitamin D status is routinely assessed through total
circulating 25(OH)D concentrations (5). Health guide-
lines recommend a standard-of-care supplemental
intake of 400 IUd�1 for infants to establish a healthy
25(OH)D
concentration
in
the
range
of
50
to
125 nmol L�1 (20–50 ngmL�1) (6,7) and to continue

 supplementation until a dietary source can provide
this amount (8). Our previous dose-response study
demonstrated that vitamin D3 dosages of at least
400 IU d�1 in breastfed infants from 1 to 12months
of age increased 25(OH)D concentrations above
50nmol L�1 (20 ng mL�1) (9) and was associated with
leaner body composition (1). The objective of the
present study was to evaluate whether vitamin D
supplementation in the first year of life (1,9) affects
body composition at 3 years of age. Exploratory anal-
yses tested for predictors of lean and fat mass to
clarify the importance of vitamin D against known fac-
tors in the acquisition of a healthy body composition.
Methods
Study design and participants
This report is on an observational follow-up of
children 3 years of age who participated in a pub-
lished trial (1,9). Briefly, 132 infants at 1 month of
age were randomized to receive one of four dosages
of vitamin D3 (400, 800, 1200 or 1600 IU d�1) until
12months with measurements conducted at 3, 6,
9 and 12months of age. After 12 months, all families
received the same brief education on using food and
supplements for achieving the recommended vitamin
D intake of 400 IUd�1 (7). Ethical approval was ob-
tained from all associated University Institutional
Review Boards. At baseline, demographic informa-
tion for both parents was self-reported, including in-
dicators of socio-economic status, education and
race. Study visits included anthropometry, blood
biochemistry and body composition measures. At
the 3-year visit, parents completed 24 h food recall,
sun index and physical activity surveys. The Peabody
motor assessment (10) was completed by a certified
occupational therapist.
Anthropometry
Height was measured using a stadiometer (Seca
213, Seca Medical Scales and Measuring Systems,
California, USA) and body mass using a calibrated
scale (Detecto, Missouri, USA). Body mass index
(BMI; kg/m2) and weight-for-age (WAZ), height-
for-age (HAZ) and BMI-for-age (BAZ) Z-scores were
derived using World Health Organization (WHO) soft-
ware (WHO AnthroPlus, Switzerland) and the WHO
2007 growth standards (11).
Biochemistry analysis
A non-fasted capillary blood sample (heparinized)
was collected via finger lance and plasma stored at
�80°C until analysis. Liquid chromatography tandem
mass
spectrometry
(LC-MS/MS)
was
used
to
measure 25(OH)D3 as well as 3-epimer-25(OH)D3,
24,25(OH)2D3 by Warnex Bioanalytical Services. This
method is described in detail elsewhere (9); intra-
assay coefficients of variation (CV) were <15% for all
vitamin D metabolites with certification obtained from
the Vitamin D External Quality Assessment Scheme.
The
measured
25(OH)D3
concentrations
of
the
National Institute of Standards and Technology stan-
dard reference materials (SRM 968e), were within
7.0% and 2.5% of the certified values for levels 2
and 3, respectively. Other biochemical measures
included
blood-ionized
calcium
(ABL80
FLEX
Radiometer Medical A/S, Denmark) and intact PTH
using ELISA (Immutopics International, California,
USA) sensitive to 1.26 pmolL�1 (12ngmL�1) and
had an intra-assay CV of <8%.
Body composition
Body composition was assessed using dual-energy
x-ray absorptiometry (DXA; APEX version 13.2 or
13.2.3, Hologic 4500A Discovery Series, Massachu-
setts, USA). Infant whole-body mode was used
between 0–12months, and whole body with paediat-
ric software was used at the 3-year visit. Output
included lean mass (g; LM), LM as a percentage of
total body mass (LM%), fat mass (g; FM), body fat
percentage and total body mass. The CV for quality
control measurements was 1% for bone mineral
content and 0.327% for bone mineral density
using a lumbar spine phantom (Hologic phantom
No. 14774). Values for LM and FM accretion
(g month�1) were calculated as change in LM/FM
from 1 month to 3 years, while LM index (LMI) and
FM index (FMI) were calculated with LM and FM
relative to height2 (kg/m2).
Habitual activity estimation scale
questionnaire
All parents completed the validated Habitual Activity
Estimation Scale (HAES) questionnaire for a weekday
(Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday) and weekend
(Saturday) over the previous 2 weeks (12). For each
time interval in the HAES (wake-up to breakfast,
breakfast to lunch, lunch to dinner and dinner to
bedtime), the percent time spent in each activity level
was used to determine their child’s overall level of
physical activity: ‘inactive’ (sleeping, resting), ‘some-
what
inactive’
(watching
television),
‘somewhat
active’ (playing with toys) and ‘very active’ (activities
that make the subject ‘breathe hard’, including
running and skipping).

 Peabody developmental motor
assessment
The Peabody assessment provides an assessment
of gross and fine motor skills composed of six sub-
tests (reflexes, stationary, locomotion, object manip-
ulation, grasping and visual-motor integration) that
measure interrelated motor abilities that develop early
in life (10).
Dietary intake
Dietary intakes were determined using three 24h
recalls (one in person, two telephone) and nutrient
intake generated using NUTRITIONIST PRO software
version 4.7.0 (Axxya Systems LLC, Washington,
USA) using the 2010b Canadian Nutrient File data-
base (Health Canada). A validated 13-item food fre-
quency questionnaire (FFQ) for preschool children,
completed by the primary caregiver, was used to
capture calcium and vitamin D intake during the
month prior to the 3-year visit (13).
Sun index
Sun exposure, winter travel to more equatorial lati-
tudes, and use of sunscreen were assessed using re-
call questionnaires that provided: percentage of body
surface area exposed, frequency of sunscreen use,
and total hours spent in direct sunlight per day. Sun
index for each child was calculated by multiplying
the percent body surface area exposed by the time
spent outside (minutes per day), although this index
does not consider the use of sun block (14). Season
was defined at the time of visit using the equinox and
solstice dates (15).
Skin pigmentation
Constitutive upper underarm and facultative fore-
head, lateral forearm shin skin pigmentation, were
measured using a spectrophotometer (CM-600D,
Konica Minolta, New Jersey, USA). The individual
typological angle (ITA) of the forehead site was calcu-
lated (ITA° = [arc tangent (L* � 50)/b*)] 180/3.14159)
(16). Infants were classified into five skin types:
dark (≤10°), olive (10–28°), medium (28–41°), fair (41–55°)
and very fair (>55°).
Statistical methods
Baseline and 3-year differences among groups were
tested using ANOVA and X2. The mean 25(OH)D con-
centration across all time points was calculated using
the area under the curve based on the trapezoidal
method. This allowed the examination of each
participant’s 25(OH)D concentration over the entire
study without looking at individual time points (the in-
terpretation was similar when each 25(OH)D assess-
ment was included). The effect of vitamin D dosage
on mean 25(OH)D concentration and body composi-
tion was evaluated. The relationship between vitamin
D status and body composition at 3 years was then
explored as a categorical variable. The Canadian
Paediatric Society (CPS) defines a 25(OH)D status
of <75nmol L�1 (30 ngmL�1) as insufficient for
normal growth and development of 6–11year-old
children (6), whereas the Institutes of Medicine
(IOM) defines <50nmol L�1 (20ng mL�1) as an
insufficient
concentration
(7).
Participants
above
or below these cut-offs were compared for body
composition using t-tests.
Regression models were constructed with variables
important to childhood development including sex,
mother’s race (white or non-white), mother’s educa-
tion, family income (above or below $60 000), mean
25(OH)D concentration, energy intake (kcal d�1) and
relative protein intake (g kg�1d�1). Other variables ex-
plored included 3-epimer-25(OH)D3, 24,25(OH)2D3,
PTH, iCa, HAES (weekdays and weekends), Peabody
scores (stationary, locomotion, and object manipula-
tion), macronutrient, vitamin D (IU d�1) and calcium
(mg d�1) intakes, and sun exposure (sun index and
skin phototype). For models where mean plasma
25(OH)D accounted for a significant amount of the
variation, we substituted 25(OH)D with the IOM
cut-off (50 nmol L�1, 20 ng mL�1) or CPS cut-off
(75 nmol L�1,
30 ng mL�1)
but
neither
improved
the model. Thus, models are presented with plasma
25(OH)D as a linear variable. Standard diagnostic
procedures were performed. To check for multicollin-
earity, we used variance inflation factor using three as
the cut-off and eigan values below 1.55. No colinearity
was detected in the models. Significance for all
statistical analyses was set at P<0.05 and performed
using SAS(version 9.2, North Carolina, USA).
Results
Eighty-seven children (66%) who completed the orig-
inal trial returned for the 3-year follow-up (49 boys, 38
girls). Anthropometric, dietary, activity, Peabody and
demographic variables at 3 years did not differ by
vitamin D supplementation group (Table 1). There
were no differences in treatment group allocation
among returners vs. non-returners; however, mothers
of
returners
were
significantly
older
(P =0.05)
and of white ethnicity (P =0.01) than non-returners
(Table S1). All children grew in lean mass and fat mass
over the duration of the study (Fig. 1).

 point (Fig. 1) show early increases in vitamin D status
from 1 to 3 months followed by declining values
thereafter in all groups to 36 months. There was no
effect of vitamin D dosage on 3-epi-25(OH)D3 or
24,25(OH)2D3 (P = 0.156; Table 1).
Effect of vitamin D on body composition
at 3years
There was no effect of vitamin D dosage group on
any body composition variable (P >0.357; Table 1).
Vitamin D status, lean and fat mass accretion over
the first 36months of life are illustrated in Fig. S1. In
addition, there was no effect of having 25(OH)D
concentration above 50 nmol L�1 for any body com-
position variable (P > 0.096; Table S2). Similarly,
there was no effect of being above >75 nmol L�1
(P > 0.078) for LM, LM %, body fat percentage, LMI
or FMI. However, children >75 nmol L�1 had a lower
FM (~450 g; 4.3 ±0.9 vs. 4.7 ±1.0 kg) compared with
children below (P =0.049).
Effect of level of physical activity on body
composition at 3years
There was a significant effect of level of physical activ-
ity on weekends on FM and BF%. Children rated
‘very active’ (20.0%) had lower FM and BF%
(P < 0.034)
compared
with
‘somewhat
inactive’
(6.2%) and ‘somewhat active’ (46.3%) children.
There were no other differences in any body compo-
sition variable according to level of physical activity on
weekdays (P > 0.547) or weekends (P > 0.255). The
Peabody assessment showed an overall gross motor
quotient of 94.3 ±13.8, and an overall percentile
of 94.0± 14.6; 92% of the children had a motor
quotient within the normal range of 100 ±15 (17).
There was no effect of any Peabody variable on body
composition.
Regression analyses/predictors of body
composition at 3-year
A significant amount of variation (adjusted R2) in
LM (Table 2) was accounted for by energy and
protein (g kg�1) intakes, whereas sex and mean
25(OH)D explained LM% and only sex was associ-
ated with LMI. In the models for FM (Table 2),
sex,
mother’s
education
and
protein
intake
(g kg�1 d�1) accounted for a significant amount of
the variation (adjusted R2) with body fat percent-
age explained by sex and mean 25(OH)D concen-
tration and FMI explained by sex and protein
intake (g kg�1).
Discussion
This follow-up study of a vitamin D supplementation
trial in healthy term-born infants, who received a daily
dose of at least 400 IU from 1 to 12 months of age, is
the first to our knowledge to focus on body composi-
tion. While there were no differences in vitamin D
status or body composition at 3-year across the dif-
ferent vitamin D dosage groups, this study provides
novel findings that suggest higher plasma 25(OH)D
concentrations early in life are associated with leaner
body composition (18). Children with 25(OH)D con-
centrations above the suggested CPS cut-off of
75nmol L�1 at 3years of age had lower FM (~450 g)
than children below 75 nmol L�1. Children with phys-
ical activity levels of ‘very active’ on weekends as
rated by their parents also had lower FM and body
fat percentage compared with children rated as
‘somewhat active’ and ‘somewhat inactive’. After ac-
counting for these important correlates, mean 25(OH)
D concentration over the first 3 years of life explained
a statistically significant amount of variation in LM%,
FM and body fat percentage. Interestingly, rapid
gains in FM during the first 8 months of life predicted
subsequent obesity at 9 years of age (4). Overall, our
data suggest that children with higher vitamin D sta-
tus over their first 3 years have a leaner body compo-
sition and that efforts to achieve healthy status
targets should be made through ensuring adequate
dietary or supplemental vitamin D intakes.
At present, there are two thresholds for evaluating
vitamin D status; the IOM (50nmolL�1) and CPS
(75 nmol L�1) suggested cut-offs. Having a 25(OH)D
concentration
above
the
75 nmol L�1
cut-off
corresponded to lower FM at 3 years of age. Consid-
ering our previous results demonstrating 69% of in-
fants receiving 1200 IUd�1 were able to achieve
75nmol L�1 by 12months as opposed to only 38%
receiving 400 IUd�1 (9) and the results of the present
study, there is a growing body of evidence to support
the CPS cut-off. Additionally, in line with our previous
data in the first year of life (1), it appears that variation
in 3-epi-25(OH)D3 and 24,25(OH)2D3 are not associ-
ated with body composition.
In addition to the mean 25(OH)D concentration
over 3 years, other variables important to body com-
position included sex, mother’s education, energy in-
take and relative protein intake (g kg�1d�1). Although
research has suggested excess FM sequesters cir-
culating vitamin D (19), our previous (1) and current
work do not support this phenomenon in infancy to
3 years of age as FM increases while 25(OH)D pla-
teaus. Male children were leaner as demonstrated
by higher LM% and LMI as well as lower FM, body

 fat percentage, and FMI compared with female
children in line with previous research (20,21).
Mother’s with higher education had leaner children
(decreased FM). Family income showed no effect on
body composition (22), in contrast with previous
research (23), which may be due to the rather homog-
enous study group. With respect to nutrition, children
with higher energy intakes (kcald�1) had higher
amounts of LM but energy intake was not linked to
other body composition variables. A higher relative
protein intake (gkg�1d�1) was inversely associated
with LM, FM and FMI, but not LM% and LMI or body
fat percentage suggesting relatively minimal effects.
Previous research has demonstrated increased protein
intakes can result in lower amounts of FM (24), although
no relationship has also been demonstrated (25) in chil-
dren as young as 3years. However, these studies did
not examine intake relative to body mass (gkg�1d�1).
Interestingly, a child’s level of physical activity on
weekends as rated by their parent was important
for FM and body fat percentage. ‘Very active’ children
had lower FM and body fat percentage than children
rated as only ‘somewhat active’ or ‘somewhat inac-
tive’ demonstrating the importance of physical activ-
ity to a leaner body composition in young children.
Although the rating of physical activity on weekdays
did not relate to body composition, weekends are
less structured implying that families who are more
active on the weekend have leaner children (26).
The present study is not without limitations. The
study group may have been too homogenous to de-
tect some relationships (all were healthy, term born,
appropriate size for gestational age and sex). Infants
were mainly (88%) breastfed until 6 months of age
(9) and demonstrated no differences between groups
in macronutrients or micronutrient intakes. Further,
our sample was predominately white and although
mother’s race had no impact on body composition,
whether this effect would have been observed in
a more demographically diverse group is unknown.
The fact that all children were receiving at least
400 IU d�1 of vitamin from 1 to 12 months likely
contributed to the very good vitamin D status
>50 nmol L�1 25(OH)D and precluded studying chil-
dren with lower vitamin D status. Although we had a
rather large sample for a repeated measures design
of over 3-year, because of the variability in body com-
position variables, a type II error cannot be ruled out.
We also did not capture data between 1 year and
3 years; thus, it is not clear whether the mean vitamin
D status is fully captured using our follow-up data.
Finally, our study cannot provide a possible mecha-
nism for the importance of vitamin D to a leaner body
composition, although previous work has demon-
strated the vitamin D receptor binds the biologically
active form of vitamin D, 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D
[1,25(OH)2D], to signal gene transcription and sensi-
tize the Akt/mTOR pathway involved in protein
synthesis (27,28). More research is certainly war-
ranted, to establish how 25(OH)D contributes to a
leaner body composition.
Conclusion
This long-term follow-up of a vitamin D supplemen-
tation study in children demonstrates no difference
in body composition across any dosage groups
(400, 800, 1200 and 1600 IU). However, a higher
vitamin D status over the first 3 years of life was as-
sociated with a leaner body composition. Further,
children
with
higher
levels
of
physical
activity
(parent-rated) were also leaner compared with less
active children. All children maintained a vitamin D
status >50nmol L�1 of 25(OH)D which is common
in population surveillance in Canada (29) and the
USA (30). This novel study demonstrates higher vi-
tamin D status and physical activity levels associate
with leaner body composition in 3-year-old children.
