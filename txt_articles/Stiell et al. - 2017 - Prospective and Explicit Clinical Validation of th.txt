ABSTRACT
Objectives: We previously developed the Ottawa Heart Failure Risk Scale (OHFRS) to assist with disposition
decisions for acute heart failure patients in the emergency department (ED). We sought to prospectively evaluate
the accuracy, acceptability, and potential impact of OHFRS.
Methods: This prospective observational cohort study was conducted at six tertiary hospital EDs. Patients with
acute heart failure were evaluated by ED physicians for the 10 OHFRS criteria and then followed for 30 days.
Quantitative NT-proBNP was measured where feasible. Serious adverse event (SAE) was defined as death within
30 days, admission to monitored unit, intubation, noninvasive ventilation, myocardial infarction, or relapse
resulting in hospital admission within 14 days.
Results: We enrolled 1,100 patients with mean (�SD) age 77.7 (�10.7) years. SAEs occurred in 170 (15.5%)
cases (19.4% if admitted and 10.2% if discharged). Compared to actual practice, using an admission threshold of
OHFRS score > 1 would have increased sensitivity (71.8% vs. 91.8%) but increased admissions (57.2% vs.
77.6%). For 684 cases with NT-proBNP values, using a threshold score > 1 would have significantly increased

 sensitivity (69.8% vs. 95.8%) while increasing admissions (60.8% vs. 88.0%). In only 11.9% of cases did
physicians indicate discomfort with use of OHFRS.
Conclusion: Prospective clinical validation found the OHFRS tool to be highly sensitive for SAEs in acute heart
failure patients, albeit with an increase in admission rates. When available, NT-proBNP values further improve
sensitivity. With adequate physician training, OHFRS should help improve and standardize admission practices,
diminishing both unnecessary admissions for low-risk patients and unsafe discharge decisions for high-risk
patients.
H
eart failure is a common and serious condition
that affects approximately 5.5 million people in
the United States and Canada.1–3 Heart failure often
coexists with other chronic diseases (such as diabetes
mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and
coronary artery disease), which further contribute to
hospitalization and prolonged lengths of stay. In 2009,
there were more than 1 million U.S primary heart fail-
ure hospitalizations and another 3 million with heart
failure as the secondary diagnosis.4 Patients who are
admitted to hospital for heart failure have readmission
rates as high as 30% to 60% within 3 to 6 months
after initial discharge.5–9 More than 1 million patients
with sudden increase of shortness of breath, due to
acute heart failure, present to U.S. and Canadian
emergency departments (EDs) each year for treat-
ment.10 In the past, virtually all patients with acute
heart failure were hospitalized.11 Today in Canada,
many of these patients are treated in the ED and sub-
sequently discharged home.8,12 Admission rates for
acute heart failure are much higher in the United
States (estimated to be 80%) than in Canada (esti-
mated to be 40%–60%), with some American physi-
cians estimating that 50% of these admissions are
unnecessary.13–15
A serious challenge facing physicians when treating
acute heart failure patients in the ED is deciding upon
disposition: whether to admit, with or without moni-
toring; or whether to discharge, with or without early
follow-up. While current consensus guidelines for
management of acute heart failure provide excellent
recommendations for diagnosis and treatment, none
offer physicians any recommendations as to which
patients should be admitted from the ED.1,16–18
Unfortunately, there is a lack of high-quality evidence
to inform potential disposition guidelines. Several risk-
stratification tools have been developed to predict
mortality for acute heart failure patients, but these
have significant limitations from the perspective of
physicians attempting to make admission decisions in
the ED, typically emergency and family physicians,
internists, and cardiologists. Published risk scales are
limited by the use of large administrative databases
rather than prospective and specific ED data collection
and by including only admitted patients.19–28 These
studies were unable to evaluate the clinical status of
patients after a period of ED management, such as the
ability of patients to ambulate without hypoxia (walk
test). Most of these scales only predict mortality,
excluding other important outcomes such as need for
intubation, myocardial infarction, short-term relapse,
and admission. None of these scales have been
prospectively validated in the clinical setting or imple-
mented into practice.
Our ultimate goal, through a series of studies, is to
prospectively derive, validate, and then implement a
clinically useful risk scoring system to guide ED admis-
sion decisions for acute heart failure patients. We pre-
viously derived the Ottawa Heart Failure Risk Scale
(OHFRS) from prospective ED data collection and
multivariable analysis, in the RAD-1 study.12 OHFRS
is composed of simple bedside variables and estimates
the probability of an adverse event (SAE) in the subse-
quent 14 days (Figure 1). The objectives of the current
study (RAD-2) were to prospectively evaluate the accu-
racy, acceptability, and potential impact of OHFRS in
a real-time clinical setting. This validation process is
important because many statistically derived rules fail
to perform well when tested clinically in a new
population.29–31

 breath (of less than 7 days’ duration) due to acute
heart failure, between 0800 and 2400 hours 7 days a
week. Patients had to be stable enough to be evaluated
for the OHFRS criteria by the attending ED physician.
Eligibility of patients was reviewed by the study steer-
ing committee. We included both patients admitted to
the hospital and those discharged from the ED. As
there is no criterion standard for the diagnosis of
heart failure, we used the criteria recommended by the
Task Force for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Acute
and Chronic Heart Failure of the European Society of
Cardiology.18,34 Patients must have had appropriate
symptoms with clinical signs of fluid retention in the
presence of an underlying abnormality of cardiac func-
tion; a beneficial response to treatment (e.g., brisk
diuresis followed by improved breathlessness) was also
considered.
We excluded patients who did not fit with the
accepted definition of acute heart failure or who were
too ill to be considered for discharge after 2–12 hours
of
ED
management:
1)
resting
oxygen
satura-
tion < 85% on room air or after being on home oxy-
gen level for 20 minutes; 2) heart rate greater than or
equal to 120 beats/min; 3) systolic blood pres-
sure < 85
mm Hg;
4)
confusion,
disorientation,
dementia; 5) primary presentation is for ischemic chest
pain requiring treatment or with acute ischemic ST-T
changes on initial electrocardiogram (ECG); 6) ST-
elevation myocardial infarction on initial ECG; 7) ter-
minal
status—death
expected
within
weeks
from
chronic illness; 8) from nursing home or chronic care
facility (not seniors residence); 9) enrolled in previous
2 months; or 10) on chronic hemodialysis.
The research ethics boards of two hospitals deter-
mined that written informed consent was required,
whereas those at the other four sites waived the need
for
written
consent
for
this
observational
study.
Patients were not involved in the design, conduct, or
interpretation of this study.
Data Collection
Patients were assessed for the original OHFRS by ED
staff physicians (all certified in emergency medicine) or
by supervised residents in emergency medicine train-
ing programs, who were trained by means of a 1-hour
practical session. The component variables and total
score were assessed and interpreted at a target of 2–8
hours after ED treatment (to a maximum of 12 hours)
and were recorded on a physician data form. Physi-
cians were advised not to make their disposition deci-
sions solely based upon the original OHFRS, which
had not yet been validated. Research assistants col-
lected other clinical and laboratory results from the
electronic patient records including standardized vari-
ables from the history, clinical examination, routine
laboratory
values,
cardiac
troponins
(initial
and
repeat < 6 hours within ED; Data Supplement S1
[available as supporting information in the online ver-
sion of this paper] shows specific assays), chest x-ray,
and initial and repeat ECG. B-type natriuretic peptide
samples were drawn from enrolled patients and then
processed in batch by The Ottawa Hospital (NT-
ProBNP with Roche Elecsys 2010 system). We con-
ducted a 3-minute walk test, after treatment, during
which patients were asked to walk at their own pace
in the ED for a fixed period of 3 minutes, regardless

 of the distance covered.12 Patients could use their nor-
mal walking aids (e.g., cane or walker) but could not
be physically supported by another person. Patients
used no supplementary oxygen or their normal home
oxygen flow level. Pulse oximeters were used to record
and continuously measure heart rate and oxygen satu-
ration levels. Not all patients were well enough to
undertake the walk test and some were unable to com-
plete the entire 3 minutes. For each patient, physicians
answered two questions related to interpretation and
use: 1) What is the total score for this patient and
what risk category does this place the patient in? (low,
medium, high, very high); 2) How comfortable would
you be in using the scale to help make a disposition
decision for this patient? (5-point scale from “very
comfortable” to “very uncomfortable”).
Outcome Measures
The primary outcome was SAE defined as:
1). Death from any cause within 30 days of the index
ED visit or
2). Any of the following within 14 days of the ED
visit, regardless of whether initially admitted: a)
Admission to a monitored unit (intensive care,
coronary care, acute monitoring, or stepdown
units; not telemetry); b) endotracheal intubation
or need for noninvasive ventilation (NIV) after
hospital admission, unless on NIV at home; c)
myocardial infarction as defined by the Joint
ESC/ACCF/AHA/WHF
Task
Force
for
the
Third Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarc-
tion;35 d) major procedure defined as unplanned
coronary artery bypass graft, percutaneous coro-
nary intervention, other cardiac surgery, or new
hemodialysis; or e) relapse and hospital admission
for patients who were discharged on the initial
ED visit, defined as a return to the ED for any
related medical problem within 14 days resulting
in admission to hospital, i.e., respiratory distress,
fever, sepsis.36 Relapse without associated admis-
sion was not considered an SAE. Of note, Cana-
dian EDs generally make disposition decisions
within 12 hours of arrival and do not use observa-
tion units.
Assessment of the primary outcome measure was
made by the investigators, blinded to the patient status
for the predictor variables, from these source docu-
ments: 1) ED health records, 2) hospital health
records, 3) computerized hospital patient tracking and
record system, and 4) review of provincial death
records. Patients not identified by hospital records
were followed by telephone at 30 days.
Knowing that the physicians sometimes incorrectly
completed their data form, we established a “criterion
interpretation” of the scale for all patients enrolled.
This criterion interpretation of the point score total
and the risk category (low, medium, high, very high)
was made by the steering committee based on the sta-
tus of the patient for the component variables as docu-
mented in the records and without knowledge of the
outcome status for SAE. This allowed us to evaluate
the performance of the scale when accurately applied.
The secondary outcomes of the study, regarding
OHFRS, were physician accuracy in interpretation,
acceptability to the physicians, and potential impact on
disposition decisions.
Data Analyses: Original OHFRS
The primary analyses used the original OHFRS score
calculated from the criterion interpretation, as deter-
mined by the steering committee. Secondary analyses
evaluated the scale as interpreted by the physicians.
OHFRS is intended to provide clinicians with an esti-
mate of risk rather than a rigid yes/no cut-point to
guide admissions. Regardless, we estimated classifica-
tion accuracy using example cut-points of >1 and >2
points to evaluate the potential impact of implement-
ing OHFRS into practice, using the criterion interpre-
tation. We calculated sensitivity and specificity with
95% confidence intervals (95% CIs), as well as poten-
tial admission rates.
We evaluated clinical sensibility in two ways. 1)
Overall accuracy was calculated as percentages with
95% CIs for interpretation of the original OHFRS by
the treating physicians versus the criterion interpreta-
tion. 2) Data regarding physicians’ theoretical comfort
with using the rule was tabulated in a simple descrip-
tive format. We assessed the potential impact by com-
paring actual admission rates to those predicted at
different threshold levels of point score totals.
RESULTS
Patients and Outcomes
Of 4,999 patients presenting with shortness of breath,
3,130 were not eligible (Figure 2). Of 1,869 eligible
patients seen, 769 were not enrolled, primarily because

 they presented when research staff were not on duty or
clinical staff were busy with patient care responsibilities.
The characteristics of these patients are very similar to
those of the patients enrolled (Data Supplement S2,
available as supporting information in the online ver-
sion of this paper). Table 1 shows the demographic and
clinical characteristics of the 1,100 patients enrolled.
The cohort had a mean (�SD) age of 77.7 (�10.7)
years, 53.1% were male, and 44.4% arrived by ambu-
lance. NT-proBNP was measured in 684 (62.1%)
patients, who were very similar to the overall cohort.
ED treatments included intravenous (IV) diuretics
90.6%, IV nitrates 3.0%, and noninvasive positive-pres-
sure ventilation 6.8%. Of all patients, 280 were deemed
too ill to do the walk test, 463 attempted the walk test,
and 357 were not asked to perform the test. For the lat-
ter group, no point was assigned to the risk scale total.
Follow-up by health records and telephone calls was
very complete and we had only to confirm 30-day sur-
vival with coroner’s records for two patients.
Overall, 57.2% of patients were admitted to hospi-
tal and 42.8% were discharged home from the ED at
the index visit (Table 2). The overall SAE rate was
15.5%, 19.4% for patients admitted, 10.2% for those
discharged from the ED, and 17.4% for those with
NT-proBNP
values.
Also,
16
of
the
41
deaths
(39.0%) during the study occurred in patients dis-
charged home from the ED or later following hospital
admission.
Performance of Predictor Variables
Table 3 displays the univariate association with SAE
for the original 10 OHFRS criteria as well as other
clinical variables that might be useful predictors.
Performance of OHFRS Without NT-proBNP
Table 4 explores the comparison between actual prac-
tice at the six study sites (sensitivity 71.8%, specificity
45.5%, admissions 57.2%) and the potential impact at
various
OHFRS
score
thresholds,
for
all
1,100
patients, without using the NT-proBNP values. We
see an excellent range of probabilities for SAE at dif-
ferent score levels, ranging from 5.7% for a total score
of 0 to 100% for a score of 8. The most useful

 threshold scores appear to be > 1 (optimal sensitivity)
and > 2 (decreased admissions). Compared to actual
practice, using an admission threshold of OHFRS
score > 1 would have increased sensitivity (71.8% vs.
91.8%) but increased admissions (57.2% vs. 77.6%).
Using a threshold > 2 would have led to a similar
sensitivity (71.8% vs. 71.2%) but reduced admission
rates (57.2% vs. 48.3%). These results are very differ-
ent from RAD-1 where only 38.1% of patients were
admitted and with an actual admission sensitivity of
only 50.8%.

 Performance of OHFRS With NT-proBNP
Second, we examined accuracy in the 684 patients for
whom NT-proBNP values were available (Table 5).
This cohort had slightly more SAEs (17.4%). Com-
pared to actual practice, using an admission threshold
of
OHFRS
score > 1
would
have
significantly
increased sensitivity (69.8% vs. 95.8%) while increas-
ing admissions (60.8% vs. 88.0%). Using a thresh-
old > 2 would have led to better sensitivity (69.8% vs.
79.8%) but with similar admission rates (60.8% vs.
63.0%).
Physician Accuracy and Acceptability
We compared risk category (i.e., low, medium, etc.)
classification
of
the
physicians
to
the
criterion
interpretation and found overall agreement of 59.2%
for the exact category and 94.7% for the exact category
�1. Issues identified were not completing the walk
test, not having the NT-proBNP values available clini-
cally, and too many criteria. In 11.9% of cases, physi-
cians indicated that they would be “uncomfortable” or
“very uncomfortable” in using OHFRS to make dispo-
sition decisions for that patient. Commonly expressed
concerns were unavailability of NT-proBNP values and
forgetting to arrange for a walk test.
DISCUSSION
Interpretation
This prospective clinical study found that 15.5% of
1,100 acute heart failure patients experienced SAEs,
with a concerning proportion occurring in those dis-
charged home from the ED. Compared to current prac-
tice,
an
OHFRS
score
threshold
of > 1
would
significantly improve sensitivity but would require more
admissions. Alternately, a threshold of > 2 would offer
similar sensitivity to current practice but reduce admis-
sions. NT-proBNP values were available for about 60%
of patients and their incorporation into the OHFRS
scores led to better sensitivity. Physicians displayed fair
accuracy in interpretation as well as good acceptance of
OHFRS. Issues of concern were lack of real-time avail-
ability of NT-proBNP values and forgetting to request a
walk test. With this successful validation, OHFRS can
now be used as an adjunct for ED disposition decision
making for heart failure patients. The scale offers physi-
cians clear insight into the medical risks and likelihood
of short-term SAEs in their patients but does not explic-
itly direct whether or not admission should occur.
Previous Studies
Several risk-stratification tools have been developed to
predict mortality for heart failure patients, and we will
focus on those for acute heart failure.19–21 We take the
perspective of physicians attempting to make admission
decisions in the ED, typically emergency and family
physicians, internists, and cardiologists. From this view-
point, most published risk scales have significant limita-
tions, particularly 1) the use of large administrative
databases rather than prospective and specific ED data
collection and 2) the use of only admitted patients.22–27
These studies were unable to evaluate the status of
patients after a period of ED management, such as the
ability of patients to ambulate without hypoxia (walk

 test). Most of these scales only predict mortality, exclud-
ing other important outcomes such as need for intuba-
tion, myocardial infarction, short-term relapse, and
admission. None of these scales have been prospectively
validated or implemented into practice. Lee and col-
leagues28 have recently derived and statistically validated
an ED-based risk scale to predict 7-day mortality in a
large sample of patients from a population-based data
set in Ontario. Potential limitations are its 1) develop-
ment from health records and the lack of prospective
“real-time” data such as the walk test or changes in
ECG and troponin, 2) use of only mortality rather than
other important outcomes, 3) complexity in calculating
risk by an on-line tool from 10 variables, and 4) lack of
prospective validation or explicit clinical use.
This RAD-2 study should be compared to RAD-1
where OHFRS was derived.12 This study had a much
higher admission rate at the index ED visit (57.2% vs.
38.1%) and overall SAE rate (15.5% vs. 11.1%). Simi-
larly, SAE rates were higher than RAD-1 for both
patients admitted (19.4% vs. 16.0%) and those dis-
charged from the ED (10.2% vs 9.0%). We wonder if
knowledge of the risk score during the current study
led physicians to be more cautious, leading to more
admissions or if the current cohort contained sicker
patients. We felt that the performance and acceptabil-
ity of OHFRS was very good. In 2014 we completed
an online survey of 195 randomly selected members
of the Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians
regarding the revised OHFRS. We found very good
overall acceptance with only 7.7% indicating OHFRS
was “not useful.”37
LIMITATIONS AND STRENGTHS
We carefully considered the issue of including both
admitted and discharged patients and believe that this
is the correct approach. Admission status may con-
found the likelihood of an SAE occurring, as some
admitted patients will not suffer SAEs because they

 receive more intensive therapy in hospital; the same
patients might have suffered SAEs if they had been
discharged from the ED. Our goal is to develop a risk
scale that aids the appropriate admission of high-risk
patients (i.e., sensitivity) as well as minimizes admis-
sion of low-risk patients (i.e., specificity). We could
only do this by including admitted patients. We chose
to use “admission to a monitored unit” as a SAE.
While there may be some variation from hospital to
hospital, we believe that this is an important indicator
of increased severity of illness.
While we could not collect NT-proBNP samples
for all patients, we believe that 684 cases is still the
largest cohort yet reported for prognosis of acute heart
failure patients. When available, quantitative NT-
proBNP values significantly improve the sensitivity for
SAEs and should be considered for use by clinicians
in the ED.
We were unable to enroll a large number of eligible
patients because they presented outside of normal
business hours and some were missed during study
hours. We could detect neither selection bias nor

Stiell et al. • RISK STRATIFICATION ACUTE HEART FAILURE
 threat to the validity of our findings but such bias may
exist.
The overall agreement of physician interpretation to
the exact risk category was poor but was very high for
the exact category �1. While this has the potential to
limit the scale’s usefulness, we have identified issues
that will improve future physician application of
OHFRS. Implementation of the scale should be
accompanied by physician education on the 10 criteria
and that highlights the importance of performing the
3-minute walk test. We expect that simple smartphone
apps or other memory aids will assist physicians in
remembering the 10 criteria. We believe that the pur-
pose of validation studies is to rigorously assess the
efficacy or accuracy of the rule itself. If the rule proves
to be accurate, then subsequent implementation stud-
ies can serve to assess the effectiveness of the rule in
“the real world.”38
We believe this study has multiple unique strengths
including the prospective and rigorous collection of
real-time clinical data including response to treatment,
ability to perform the walk test, and incorporation of
NT-proBNP values. We were able to evaluate repeat
ECGs and cardiac troponin values. The very large
number of SAE cases from this multicenter study
allowed a very robust analysis with stable estimates of
performance. We believe that the use of other impor-
tant outcomes besides mortality increases the clinical
relevance
of
OHFRS
for
physicians
determining
whether to admit or discharge their acute heart failure
patients.
Clinical Implications
Ideal patient care balances the best interests of patients
with appropriate use of hospital resources, with prior-
ity being given to safety. When treating acute heart fail-
ure patients in the ED, physicians must decide
whether to admit, with or without monitoring, or
whether to discharge, with or without early follow-up.
It is neither necessary nor efficient to admit all
patients as many will respond to therapy in the ED
and will not benefit from hospitalization. We know
that hospitalization itself is associated with risks to
patients, e.g., hospital-acquired infections. Even so,
many admitted acute heart failure patients have SAEs;
i.e., they die, require intensive care therapy, or suffer
myocardial infarction. In addition, a significant num-
ber of patients are discharged from the ED after treat-
ment only to die or relapse back to the ED and
require admission.
We have chosen to develop a risk-stratification scale,
rather than a simple “high-risk low-risk” rule, that allows
the attending physician to better understand the likeli-
hood that a given patient will have a poor outcome. We
intend OHFRS to be used in a pragmatic, rather than
dogmatic, fashion to ensure that patients are managed
in a safe and efficient manner. Depending on local prac-
tice, OHFRS could lead to either an increase or a
decrease in hospital admissions. More important than
altering the admission rate is ensuring admission of the
correct patients, i.e., those at highest risk of a poor out-
come. We recognize that many nonmedical factors are
important in the decision to admit a patient, such as
whether the patient has support at home or whether
early follow-up can be arranged. We see OHFRS as an
important tool to help physicians gauge the medical risk
for their acute heart failure patients, while they deter-
mine the need for admission or early follow-up.
Research Implications
All new clinical tools must be prospectively and explic-
itly evaluated in multiple settings to ensure their use-
fulness in improving patient outcomes. Our research
group has developed and tested many clinical decision
tools for traumatic and medical conditions.39–43 In all
cases we believe that the true clinical effectiveness of
decision tools should be demonstrated in controlled
implementation trials.44,45 We expect to evaluate, by a
randomized trial, the implementation of OHFRS into
clinical practice. In addition we expect there will be a
need to create knowledge translation tools such as
mobile clinical applications for computers and hand-
held devices.
CONCLUSIONS
We have conducted a successful prospective clinical
validation of the Ottawa Heart Failure Risk Scale tool
that can now be used in clinical practice to estimate
the short-term risk of serious adverse events in acute
heart failure patients. When available, NT-proBNP val-
ues improve sensitivity. With adequate physician train-
ing, Ottawa Heart Failure Risk Scale will be a useful
tool for making rational disposition plans in the ED.
This should improve and standardize admission prac-
tices, diminishing both unnecessary admissions for
low-risk patients and unsafe discharge decisions for
high-risk
patients.
This
will
ultimately
lead
to
improved safety for patients and more efficient use of
precious hospital resources.
