Abstract
Epigenetic “readers” that recognize defined posttranslational modifications on histones have 
become desirable therapeutic targets for cancer and inflammation. SP140 is one such 
bromodomain and plant homeodomain (PHD)–containing reader with immune-restricted 
expression, and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within SP140 associate with Crohn’s

 disease (CD). However, the function of SP140 and the consequences of disease-associated SP140 
SNPs have remained unclear. We show that SP140 is critical for transcriptional programs that 
uphold the macrophage state. SP140 preferentially occupies promoters of silenced, lineage-
inappropriate genes bearing the histone modification H3K27me3, such as the HOXA cluster in 
human macrophages, and ensures their repression. Depletion of SP140 in mouse or human 
macrophages resulted in severely compromised microbe-induced activation. We reveal that 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) or B cells from individuals carrying CD-associated 
SNPs within SP140 have defective SP140 messenger RNA splicing and diminished SP140 protein 
levels. Moreover, CD patients carrying SP140 SNPs displayed suppressed innate immune gene 
signatures in a mixed population of PBMCs that stratified them from other CD patients. 
Hematopoietic-specific knockdown of Sp140 in mice resulted in exacerbated dextran sulfate 
sodium (DSS)–induced colitis, and low SP140 levels in human CD intestinal biopsies correlated 
with relatively lower intestinal innate cytokine levels and improved response to anti–tumor 
necrosis factor (TNF) therapy. Thus, the epigenetic reader SP140 is a key regulator of macrophage 
transcriptional programs for cellular state, and a loss of SP140 due to genetic variation contributes 
to a molecularly defined subset of CD characterized by ineffective innate immunity, normally 
critical for intestinal homeostasis.
INTRODUCTION
The epigenome is essential for generating signal-specific, cell lineage–specific, and 
kinetically precise gene expression in diverse cell types. Modifications on histones control 
the accessibility of DNA to transcription factors and serve as docking sites for epigenetic 
“reader” proteins that aid the assembly of transcriptional machinery complexes (1–4). 
Disruption of numerous epigenetic proteins culminates in malignant disease (5); however, 
our understanding of the role of altered epigenome regulators in nonmalignant, immune-
driven disorders is relatively limited.
Epigenetic readers are structurally diverse proteins with evolutionarily conserved domains 
that dock to covalent modifications of histones, DNA, or transcription factors (6–8). They 
hold great promise as therapeutic targets in cancer and inflammation. For instance, members 
of the broadly expressed BET [bromodomain (the interaction module that reads ε-N-
acetylation) and extraterminal] family perform central roles in translating histone 
modifications into context-specific transcription in cancer cells (9, 10), macrophages (1, 3, 
11), and T cells (12, 13); show remarkable therapeutic tractability (3, 9); and are under 
investigation in several clinical trials (7, 14). However, the human proteome contains 46 
bromodomain-containing proteins, each with defined affinities to certain histone acetylation 
sites (8), distinct tissue expression patterns, and unique protein interactors (4)—many of 
which remain uncharacterized. The bromodomain-containing protein SP140 is preferentially 
expressed in cells of the immune system (15), suggesting an immune-specific role for this 
epigenetic reader. Moreover, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within SP140 have 
been significantly associated with immune disorders, such as Crohn’s disease (CD) (16, 17), 
B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (18), and multiple sclerosis (MS) (19), and 
autoantibodies against SP140 have been detected in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis

 (20). Despite these findings, the function of SP140 and the consequence of disease-
associated SP140 SNPs have remained unknown.
SP140 belongs to the speckled protein (SP) family consisting of SP100, SP110, and 
SP140L, which have high sequence homology with the Autoimmune Regulator (AIRE) (21). 
SP family members are components of promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (PML-NBs), 
which are ill-defined subnuclear structures regulated by a variety of cellular stresses [such as 
virus infection and interferon (IFN) and DNA damage], with implicated roles in many 
cellular processes, including higher-order chromatin organization (22). SP140 has several 
features indicative of a transcriptional regulator: an N-terminal HSR domain, a SAND 
domain [named after the few proteins (namely, SP100, AIRE, NucP41/P75, and DEAF) that 
have it] that interacts with DNA directly or through protein-protein interaction (23, 24), a 
plant homeodomain (PHD) that docks to histone methylation, and a bromodomain that binds 
acetylated histones (8). A potential transcriptional activator role for SP140 has been 
proposed (25).
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including CD, is a complex disease involving 
inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract that is triggered by genetic, environmental, and 
possibly epigenetic factors (26, 27). Genome-wide association studies have identified more 
than 160 IBD-associated genetic variants (16), some of which have revealed the importance 
of competent and protective bacterial defense pathways elicited in response to commensal 
microbes in controlling intestinal homeostasis (26, 28–31). In this study, we investigated 
how an IBD-associated genetic variant of the epigenetic reader SP140 might impinge on 
defense responses to microbes that determine intestinal homeostasis.
We show that SP140 is a key orchestrator of transcriptional programs that support 
macrophage activation state attained in response to cytokines and microbes, through 
repression of lineage-inappropriate genes, including HOX genes. These SP140-dependent 
transcriptional programs are indispensable for intestinal and immune homeostasis, as the 
loss-of-expression consequences of CD-associated SP140 SNPs we identified led to 
significantly suppressed innate immune gene signatures in a mixed population of peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), which stratified CD patients carrying SP140 SNPs from 
other CD patients not harboring SP140 polymorphisms. Furthermore, hematopoietic-specific 
depletion of Sp140 in mice led to exacerbated dextran sulfate sodium–induced (DSS) colitis, 
and low SP140 levels in human intestinal tissue correlated with relatively lower innate 
cytokine levels in diseased intestinal tissue and improved response to anti–tumor necrosis 
factor (TNF) therapy.
Thus, the epigenetic reader SP140 is central to the regulation of macrophage transcriptional 
programs critical to the establishment of intestinal homeostasis. This role of SP140 has 
direct relevance to human disease since a loss of SP140 by human genetic variation 
contributes to the development of CD.

 RESULTS
SP140 is critical for mouse and human macrophage transcriptional programs
With the initial aim of identifying bromodomain-containing epigenetic readers that 
preferentially regulate immune cell function, we found SP140 to be selectively expressed in 
cells of the immune system (Fig. 1A) (15), with greatest abundance in mature B cells, 
dendritic cells, macrophages, and granulocytes and low amounts in hematopoietic stem cells 
(HSCs), monocytes, and T cells (fig. S1). SNPs within SP140 have been associated with CD 
(16, 17), and SP family members have previously been identified as IFN-stimulated genes 
(ISGs) (32, 33). We therefore examined a potential role for SP140 in innate immune 
responses and inflammation. We found that SP140 expression was high in both human 
M(IFN-γ) and mouse M[IFN-γ + lipopolysaccharide (LPS)] or M(LPS) macrophages, low 
in M[interleukin-4 (IL-4)] macrophages (Fig. 1, B and C), and up-regulated upon Toll-like 
receptor 2 (TLR2) or TLR4 activation (Fig. 1D and fig. S1). Short hairpin RNA (shRNA)–
mediated knockdown of Sp140 in mouse macrophages resulted in a significant down-
regulation (P < 0.05, >1.5-fold) of almost 50% of all LPS-induced genes (Fig. 1E, fig. S2, 
and table S1), including transcripts that typically characterize M(LPS) activation status, such 
as the cytokines Il6, Il1a, Il15, Tnfsf4, and Tnfsf15 and the chemokines Cxcl10, Cxcl2, 
Ccl5, Ccl2, Ccl7, Ccl17, and Cxcl4. The transcription factors Nfkb2, Rel, Ear2, Ear3, and 
Ear10 and the chromatin modifiers or remodelers Arid2, Hdac2, and Setd3 were also 
significantly down-regulated (Fig. 1E and table S1). A transient, small interfering RNA 
(siRNA)–mediated knockdown of Sp140 with three separate siRNAs or a pool of four 
siRNA sequences in terminally differentiated macrophages (Fig. 1F, looks like fig. S2C, and 
Fig. 1G) also led to a significant reduction in Il6, Tnf, and Ifnb1 transcripts after LPS 
stimulation (Fig. 1G and fig. S2) as well as IL-6 and TNF protein production (fig. S2). 
Similarly, SP140 knockdown with a pool of four different siRNA sequences in human 
peripheral blood–derived macrophages resulted in a significant down-regulation of cytokines 
and cytokine receptors (TNF, TNFSF9, CSF1, CSF3, IL3RA, and IL1RN), chemokines 
(CCL1, CCL20, and XCR1), and transcription factors (SMAD7, SMAD1, and NFATC1) 
typically seen in LPS-induced macrophages differentiated with macrophage colony-
stimulating factor (M-CSF) and IFN-γ (Fig. 1H and table S2). We also saw an 
uncharacteristic up-regulation of T cell receptor components (CD3E, CD3D, CD3Z, CD247, 
and ITK) in SP140 knockdown M(IFN-γ+LPS 4h) macrophages. This suggests that without 
SP140, correct macrophage identity or reprogramming under M-CSF/IFN-γ/LPS 
differentiating and activating conditions is significantly deviated. Gene set enrichment 
analysis (GSEA) of SP140-dependent genes revealed a significant down-regulation of a 
number of inflammatory or innate immune gene set signatures upon SP140 knockdown and 
an up-regulation of Myc, E2F, and oxidative phosphorylation gene sets, where the latter is 
normally down-regulated because of the induction of aerobic glycolysis upon pathogen 
stimulation of macrophages (Fig. 1I) (34). Furthermore, ineffective activation of human 
macrophages with SP140 deficiency was confirmed by quantitative polymerase chain 
reaction (qPCR) of IL6 and TNF transcripts in TLR4-stimulated macrophages from five 
independent donors (Fig. 1J). Thus, SP140 is a critical regulator of TLR4-induced 
transcriptional programs in mouse and human macrophages, and compromised SP140 
expression results in a significantly altered state of macrophage activation.

 SP140 occupies transcriptional start sites in human macrophages
Bromodomain-containing proteins associate with chromatin by binding to acetylated 
histones or transcription factors (6–8). The SP140 bromodomain has a high but nonselective 
affinity for multiple acetylated histone peptide sites in vitro (8). However, SP140 also 
contains a SAND domain predicted to interact with DNA directly or through protein-protein 
interaction (23, 24) and a PHD that reads methylated histones (Fig. 2A). However, the PHD 
of SP140 may be atypical (35, 36). Nevertheless, there is no evidence to date demonstrating 
an association between SP140 and chromatin in cells. We conducted chromatin 
immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) experiments to 
determine the global occupancy of endogenous SP140 in primary human macrophages 
M(IFN-γ) and M(IFN-γ+LPS 4h). This revealed a majority of SP140 occupancy at 
promoters (58.0%), defined as 5 kb upstream and downstream from the transcriptional start 
site (TSS) (Fig. 2B). SP140 was also found at enhancers (11.5%) [defined as regions greater 
than 5 kb from a TSS and marked with either H3K27ac or H3K4me1, or both (37)], within 
gene bodies (20.7%), and at distal intergenic regions (9.8%) (Fig. 2B), all of which did not 
change significantly upon the addition of LPS for 4 hours (fig. S3). Rank ordering of 
promoter SP140 occupancy in unstimulated and LPS-stimulated M(IFN-γ) macrophages 
revealed SP140 enrichment precisely at the TSS (Fig. 2C). The rank ordering of genes 
occupied by SP140 was altered upon LPS stimulation, but the TSS location was not (fig. 
S3). We next established a chromatin landscape for SP140 in human macrophages by using 
publicly available human macrophage ChIP-seq data for H3K4me3 to identify active or 
poised promoters, H3K27me3 to represent transcriptionally repressed regions, and H3K27ac 
or H3K4me1 to identify enhancers. Analysis of SP140 enrichment data as a metagene 
centered on the TSS revealed spatial colocalization of SP140 with H3K4me3 and 
H3K27me3 in promoters (Fig. 2D). We saw co-occupancy of promoter-bound SP140 
(defined as peaks within TSS ± 5 kb) with H3K4me3 or H3K27me3 peaks, with more than 
50% of all promoter-bound SP140 overlapping (within 0.5 kb) with regions marked by 
H3K4me3, H3K27me3, or a combination of these (fig. S4). We also observed SP140 overlap 
at inactive and active enhancers bearing H3K27ac, H3K4me1, or both marks (Fig. 2D and 
fig. S4) but no enrichment at “super-enhancers,” as defined by regions with the highest 
ranking of H3K27ac (fig. S5) (38). These results indicate that SP140 interacts with 
chromatin predominantly at gene promoter regions or TSS in human macrophages.
SP140 occupies repressed genes bearing H3K27me3 with inaccessible chromatin
Changes in H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 ratios on bivalent chromatin domains not only 
underlie cell-specific gene expression during differentiation but also enable fine-tuning of 
gene expression in differentiated cells (39). Therefore, we next examined quantitative 
relationships between SP140 and H3K27me3 or H3K4me3 in human macrophages. SP140 
enrichment (ChIP-seq tag counts) positively correlated with H3K27me3 enrichment, with 
regions of highest SP140 occupancy being concentrated at high H3K27me3 and low 
H3K4me3, considered to be loci with low transcriptional activity (ρ = 0.58; P < 1 × 10−16) 
(Fig. 2, E and F). A correlation analysis of SP140 peak signal compared with ranked 
H3K27me3 ChIP peak signal values in human M(IFN-γ) and M(IFN-γ+LPS 4h) confirmed 
these findings (ρ = 0.64; P < 2.2 × 10−16) (fig. S6). We next performed assays for 
transposase-accessible chromatin (ATAC-seq) (40) in human M(IFN-γ) and M(IFN-γ+LPS

 4h) macrophages and found that genes with the greatest SP140 occupancy (top 10% of 
SP140 ChIP peaks) showed markedly reduced chromatin accessibility at promoters 
compared with genes with low SP140 occupancy (bottom 10% of SP140 ChIP peaks) (Fig. 
2G). We observed a similar trend of reduced chromatin accessibility at regions of high 
H3K27me3, a known repressive modification (fig. S7). Thus, SP140 preferentially occupies 
repressed genes with inaccessible chromatin and high H3K27me3 in human macrophages.
SP140 represses macrophage lineage-inappropriate genes, including HOX genes
To understand the functional significance of SP140 occupancy, we used the Genomic 
Regions Enrichment of Annotations Tool (GREAT) (41) and found the top gene families 
occupied by SP140 in human macrophages to be macrophage-inappropriate transcription 
factors. These included multiple homeobox (HOX) gene families, oligodendrocyte-specific 
basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors, forkhead box (FOX) family members, T-box 
transcription factors, and sex-determining region box (Fig. 3A and fig. S3). Upon siRNA-
mediated knockdown of SP140 in macrophages, we observed a marked increase in 
chromatin accessibility at the TSS of the top 10% of genes occupied by SP140 (Fig. 3B). 
The genes that showed increased chromatin accessibility were both up-regulated and down-
regulated [greater than twofold; false discovery rate (FDR), <0.05] upon knockdown of 
SP140, as determined by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) (Fig. 3C). However, genes with the 
greatest SP140 occupancy (top 5% of ChIP-seq peaks) showed a higher probability of being 
up-regulated upon depletion of SP140 (Fig. 3D), whereas those genes that were down-
regulated did not (Fig. 3D), suggesting an indirect regulation of these genes by SP140.
We next focused on SP140 regulation of HOX genes, which include the HOXL, NKL, PRD, 
LIM, and SIX families, all of which were significantly overrepresented SP140 targets (Fig. 
3A and fig. S3). Of all the HOX cluster genes, SP140 occupancy was highest at HOXA9 
(Fig. 3E), which is the most abundantly expressed HOX in HSCs, a known preserver of HSC 
self-renewal capacity, and is markedly down-regulated upon myeloid differentiation and 
macrophage activation (42). HOXA9 is also a known repressor of several genes controlling 
macrophage differentiation and function (43). At the HOXA cluster, SP140 preferentially 
occupied the “late” HOXA7 to HOXA13 cluster over the “early” HOXA1 to HOXA5 cluster 
in human M(IFN-γ) and M(IFN-γ+LPS 4h) macrophages (Fig. 3E). As reported in 
differentiated mouse macrophages (44), we found that human M(IFN-γ) macrophages 
expressed high HOXA1 and low HOXA9 (Fig. 3F, inset). A knockdown of SP140 resulted in 
a significant up-regulation of HOXA9 expression (Fig. 3G, looks like fig. S12A), assigning a 
repressive role to SP140 occupancy at HOXA9. Consistent with this, human and mouse 
macrophages with a knockdown of SP140 and unrestrained HOXA9/Hoxa9 were incapable 
of fully reprogramming after exposure to LPS (Fig. 1). Furthermore, depletion of both 
SP140 and HOXA9 restored expression of surface markers and cytokines, such as CD11b, 
CSFR1, and IL6, in human macrophages (Fig. 3H). Thus, through repression of lineage-
inappropriate genes and particularly through repression of HOXA9, SP140 promotes the 
emergence and preservation of macrophage activation status.

 CD-associated polymorphisms within SP140 alter SP140 mRNA splicing
We examined the effect of the CD-associated SP140 SNPs on SP140 mRNA expression by 
RNA-seq of whole blood from individuals homozygous for the CD-risk SP140 SNP 
rs7423615 (SNP+/+, red) and sex-and age-matched controls (SNP−/−, black). Multiple SNPs 
are in perfect linkage disequilibrium (LD) (r2 ≥ 0.90; D′ ≥ 0.98) with the top CD-associated 
intronic SNPs rs7423615 and rs6716753 (Fig. 4A) (16, 17), including those associated with 
CLL (rs13397985) (18) and MS (rs10201872) (19), and hence may act coordinately 
(hereafter collectively referred to as SNP+/+). All of these SP140 SNPs are intronic, except 
for a single SNP in exon 7 (rs28445040) that was recently suggested to be the causal SNP 
(45). Of the five known protein-coding mRNA isoforms of SP140 (Fig. 4B), we observed a 
selective and significant elevation in the expression of the SP140 isoform 
ENST00000343805, which is devoid of exons 7 and 11, in peripheral blood from individuals 
carrying SP140 risk alleles (SNP+/+) (fig. S8). Similarly, we observed a specific and 
significant elevation of the SP140 isoform ENST00000343805 as well as a reduction in the 
expression of the SP140 isoforms ENST00000392045, 417495, 420434, and 373645 in 
PBMC RNA-seq data from the extensive BIOS Cohort (46), in individuals carrying one or 
two alleles of the CD-associated SP140 SNPs (SNP−/+, n = 206; SNP+/+, n = 18; SNP−/−, n 
= 428) (Fig. 4C). The expression levels of a shorter SP140 isoform (ENST00000373645) 
was unaffected, implicating SNPs further downstream in causing defective splicing of SP140 
(Fig. 4C). The splicing defect driven by disease-associated SP140 SNPs was also observed 
in type I IFN and influenza-activated dendritic cells (fig. S8) (47). Furthermore, qPCR with 
exon-specific primers for SP140 exons 1 and 7 confirmed low levels of exon 7 but equal 
levels of exon 1 in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)–transformed B cells homozygous for the 
SP140 risk SNPs (Fig. 4D). Thus, our data show that the CD-associated SNPs within SP140 
alter SP140 mRNA splicing, leading to elevated expression of the SP140 isoform 
ENST00000343805 devoid of exons 7 and 11 and an overall reduction in total SP140 
mRNA expression.
Individuals carrying CD-associated SP140 SNPs have reduced and truncated SP140 
protein
We next examined how the CD-associated SP140 SNPs that disrupted mRNA splicing affect 
SP140 protein levels. Exons 7 and 11 of SP140 do not code for any of the chromatin binding 
domains (SAND, PHD, and bromodomain) or nuclear localization sequence, but their 
exclusion is predicted to cause in-frame deletions of 26- and 33-amino acid peptide 
segments (~6.6 kDa) from the SP140 protein product. We assayed endogenous SP140 
protein levels by immunoblot in EBV-immortalized B cell lines from individuals 
homozygous for rs7423615 and associated SNPs (+/+) and observed a truncation of nuclear-
localized SP140 protein isoforms (98- to 86-kDa isoforms) (Fig. 4E, looks like fig. S9C). 
Moreover, a pronounced loss of SP140 protein levels was evident (61 to 76% reduction in 
SNP+/+ cells from Caucasian individuals and 11% reduction in SNP+/+ cells from Sub-
Saharan African individuals) (Fig. 4E), whereas expression of the related SP110 protein, 
whose genomic locus is adjacent to SP140 and appears to share a divergent promoter, was 
unchanged (Fig. 4E). Hence, individuals homozygous for CD-associated SNPs within SP140 
have reduced protein levels of this epigenetic reader.

 PBMCs carrying CD-associated SP140 SNPs have suppressed innate immune gene 
signatures
Given the identified role of SP140 in the maintenance of transcriptional programs that 
uphold macrophage differentiation and activation status and the mounting evidence of 
impaired homeostatic bacterial defense pathways in CD (26), we next assessed the 
consequence of the SP140 CD-risk SNPs on the induction of innate immune responses in 
CD patients. We used global transcriptional profiling by RNA-seq to assess differentially 
expressed genes in PBMCs from healthy controls (HCs), CD patients not carrying SP140 
SNPs (CD+ SP140 SNP−/−), and CD patients homozygous for SP140 SNPs (CD+ SP140 
SNP+/+) before and after LPS stimulation. Similar to what we observed in EBV B cell lines, 
CD patients homozygous for SP140 SNPs had a specific reduction in the expression of 
SP140 exon 7 in whole blood and a marked loss of SP140 protein in PBMCs (Fig. 5, A and 
B, looks like fig. S12B). We did not observe any genotype-specific differences in the 
proportion, activation status, or type of leukocyte subsets within PBMCs, as assessed with 
flow cytometry using established surface markers (fig. S10). However, CD+ SP140 SNP+/+ 
PBMCs showed a considerably enhanced deviation in gene expression from HCs compared 
with CD+ SP140 SNP−/− PBMCs (~1100 compared with ~350 differentially expressed 
genes, respectively) (Fig. 5C). The vast majority of CD+ SP140 SNP+/+ differential genes 
were down-regulated compared with HCs (Fig. 5, D and E). Furthermore, only ~15% of the 
genes were differentially expressed in both SNP+/+ and SNP−/− compared with HCs, 
demonstrating clearly molecularly defined and stratified subsets of CD (Fig. 5C and fig. 
S10). A number of genes (496 or 442) were differentially expressed between CD+ SP140 
SNP+/+ and CD+ SP140 SNP−/− PBMCs, most of which were down-regulated in CD+ SP140 
SNP+/+ (Fig. 5, C and D, fig. S10, and table S3). The genes that stratified SP140 SNP+/+ CD 
patients from other CD patients contain known HOXA9 targets (43) that are associated with 
macrophage differentiation status and identity (CD300A, CD163, CSFR1, CD209, CD36, 
TLR4, and CCR1) and were specifically down-regulated in SP140 SNP+/+ PBMCs at steady 
state. Upon LPS stimulation, a number of cytokines and chemokines such as IL6, IL1A, 
IFNG, CXCL1, CCL1, CCL2, and CCL7 that define M(LPS) cells were uniquely down-
regulated in SP140 SNP+/+ PBMCs (Fig. 5E and table S3). Unbiased GSEA of genes that 
stratified CD+ SP140 SNP+/+ PBMCs from CD SP140 SNP−/− PBMCs revealed 
inflammatory response, TNF–nuclear factor κB, type I IFN, type II IFN, and IL-6–Janus 
kinase–STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) gene sets as the most 
significantly down-regulated in CD+ SP140 SNP+/+ PBMCs (Fig. 5F). Thus, CD patients 
homozygous for SP140 SNPs stratify from other CD patients not carrying SP140 SNPs by 
displaying suppressed innate immune signatures in a mixed population of PBMCs.
SP140 SNP+/+ PBMCs have compromised TLR-induced cytokine production
We next measured cytokine production from CD patient PBMCs with (SP140 SNP+/+) or 
without (SP140 SNP−/−) SP140 SNPs, stimulated ex vivo with TLR4 or TLR3 ligands, and 
observed notable SP140 genotype–specific differences. PBMCs from SP140 SNP+/+ patients 
produced significantly less IL6 and TNF transcript after stimulation with LPS or 
polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (PolyI:C) (Fig. 6A). We also observed significantly reduced 
secretion of cytokines IL-6, TNF, IL-12, IFN-γ, and IL-8, and CCL3 after TLR4 or TLR3 
stimulation of PBMCs from CD+ SP140 SNP+/+ patients and significantly reduced

 production of IL-1β, CCL3, and IL-15 after TLR3 stimulation (Fig. 6, B and C). PBMCs 
from CD+ SP140 SNP+/+ patients displayed significantly enhanced production of IL-13, a 
type 2 cytokine involved in both beneficial tissue repair and pathological fibrosis (48), after 
TLR4 or TLR3 activation (Fig. 6D). Hence, a genetic loss of SP140 prevents proper 
transcriptional reprogramming in response to TLR activation. As a result, CD patients 
homozygous for CD-associated SNPs within SP140 generate compromised innate immune 
responses, a known contributing factor to intestinal imbalance and inflammation (26), 
compared with other CD patients not carrying the SP140 CD-risk allele.
Hematopoietic knockdown of mouse Sp140 exacerbates DSS-colitis
To determine whether a deficiency of Sp140 can drive intestinal inflammation in vivo, we 
performed an inducible shRNA-mediated hematopoietic depletion of Sp140 in mice. Bone 
marrow that was lentivirally transduced with shSp140 or a control shRNA under an 
isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)–inducible promoter was transferred to 
irradiated congenic hosts, and IPTG was administered to trigger shRNA transcription and 
Sp140 depletion after full reconstitution of the hematopoietic system (Fig. 7A). Ficoll-
isolated circulating PBMCs from mice reconstituted with shSp140-transduced bone marrow 
were CD45.1+ (Fig. 7B) and Sp140-depleted (Fig. 7C). Furthermore, an immunoblot of 
splenic lysates confirmed hematopoietic depletion of Sp140 (Fig. 7D, looks like fig. S12C). 
We subjected the mice to a DSS model of colitis, a useful model for studying the 
contribution of the innate immune system to IBD. Mice with a hematopoietic-specific 
depletion of Sp140 (Fig. 7, B and C) displayed exacerbated colitis symptoms, as evidenced 
by significantly more weight loss (Fig. 7E), higher disease activity scores (Fig. 7F), 
increased fecal lipocalin (Fig. 7G), and reduced colon length (Fig. 7, H and I), compared 
with control mice. In addition, SP140-depleted mice had increased intestinal permeability, as 
measured by fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)–dextran in the blood 4 hours after gavage 
administration (Fig. 7J), as well as increased bacterial load in mesenteric lymph nodes (Fig. 
7K). Colonic explants from SP140-depleted mice had elevated cytokine production (Fig. 
7L), and SP140-depleted mice had significantly increased serum IL-6 (Fig. 7M). 
Furthermore, SP140-depleted mice had significantly higher histopathology scores with a 
more severe loss of goblet cell morphology, a diffuse lymphocytic infiltrate to the level of 
the lamina submucosa, a thickening of the mucosa, and extensive edema (Fig. 7, N and O). 
Thus, expression and function of immune-restricted Sp140 is a requirement for intestinal 
homeostasis, and a loss of Sp140 drives intestinal inflammation.
Lower SP140 expression in intestinal biopsies correlates with better response to anti-TNF 
therapy
Given that SP140 SNP CD patients stratified from other CD patients by ineffective innate 
immunity and reduced cytokine production from PBMCs, we next examined whether SP140 
expression correlated with innate cytokine levels in the intestine of IBD patients and their 
responsiveness to anti-TNF therapy. About 20% of patients are primary nonresponders to 
anti-TNF therapy, and 31 to 38% will eventually fail therapy. One predictor of 
responsiveness is a lower baseline expression of TNF and other cytokines in the intestine 
(49). We mined transcript expression data of intestinal biopsies taken before or after anti-
TNF (infliximab) therapy (50) and found significantly lower expression of SP140 in

 intestinal biopsies taken before treatment in patients who ultimately responded to anti-TNF 
(Fig. 8A). After anti-TNF treatment, SP140 levels were further reduced in anti-TNF 
responders but remained elevated in anti-TNF nonresponders (Fig. 8A). Lower SP140 
mRNA levels in intestinal biopsies of TNF responders were independent of the immune cell 
composition (fig. S11). We also found lower levels of many innate immune cytokines in 
intestinal biopsies of patients with low SP140 expression compared with patients with high 
SP140 expression (Fig. 8B). Moreover, Gene Ontology analysis of all genes that positively 
correlated with SP140 expression in intestinal biopsies (r2 > 0.75) revealed gene signatures 
associated with immune cell activation (Fig. 8C). Thus, SP140 levels in intestinal biopsies 
correlate with the intestinal inflammatory state and are predictive of responsiveness to anti-
TNF therapy.
DISCUSSION
Our current understanding of disrupted epigenetic programs in immune-mediated disease is 
limited. Here, we report on SP140, a previously uncharacterized immune-restricted 
epigenetic reader that has previously reported SNPs that associate with CD (16, 17), CLL 
(18), and MS (19). We show that individuals bearing CD-associated SP140 SNPs, most of 
which are intronic and in perfect LD with SP140 SNPs associated with CLL and MS, have 
alterations in SP140 mRNA splicing that ultimately result in loss of SP140 protein, 
consistent with the findings from a recent publication (45). Consequently, CD patients 
deficient in this epigenetic reader exhibited hyporesponsive innate immune responses to 
bacteria or viral ligands that stratified them from other CD patients. The development of 
IBD is influenced by host genetics as well as dysbiosis and impaired handling of commensal 
bacteria and virus communities (16, 26). Our data now provide evidence that an inability to 
interpret the immune epigenome due to loss of SP140 contributes to IBD. Furthermore, it 
adds SP140 to a number of other IBD-associated genes (NOD2, ATG16L1, GPR65, and 
AIM2) that drive innate immunity in the intestine and whose loss or variation results in 
impaired barrier defense, decreased cytokine production, and an inability to maintain gut 
microbial balance, which ultimately enhances intestinal inflammation (26, 28–30, 51).
We demonstrate in human M(IFN-γ) and M(IFN-γ+LPS) macrophages that the 
bromodomain/PHD/SAND domain–containing SP140 interacts with chromatin, 
predominantly at promoters and primarily at silenced, lineage-inappropriate genes marked 
by H3K27me3, to orchestrate macrophage transcriptional programs both at steady state and 
in response to cytokines and microbes. The highest amount of SP140 was found at HOX 
genes, particularly HOXA9, a known promoter of stem-like state in HSCs and an inhibitor of 
macrophage differentiation (42, 43, 52). Our work thus reveals an essential role for the 
epigenome reader SP140 in the coordination of HOX gene expression in mature 
macrophages. Many other epigenetic regulators also contribute to the management of 
hematopoietic HOX gene expression (39). These include two opposing groups of histone 
methyltransferases: MLL (mixed-lineage leukemia) and the EZH2 subunit of PRC2, as well 
as the H3K27me3 demethylase JMJD3. Similar to what we observed after SP140 
knockdown, genetic deletion or chemical inhibition of JMJD3 resulted in significantly 
altered macrophage activation after exposure to helminth or bacteria (53, 54). Further work 
is warranted to understand how the elaborate epigenetic regulation of HOX genes functions

 in a range of macrophage tissue subtypes and precisely at what stage of cellular 
differentiation and/or activation. We also found SP140 occupancy on several other lineage-
determining transcription factors that are repressed in macrophages (the oligodendrocyte-
specific basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors OLIG1 to OLIG3; the FOX family 
members FOXB1, FOXC2, FOXD2, FOXD3, and FOXG1; and the paired box proteins 
PAX2, PAX3, PAX5, PAX6, PAX8, and PAX9). Therefore, we propose that by suppressing 
multiple lineage-inappropriate genes in differentiated macrophages, SP140 coordinates 
transcriptional output that defines the macrophage state, particularly after exposure to 
cytokines and microbial pathogen–associated molecular patterns.
Given that our study is the first to examine the function of the epigenetic reader SP140 in 
any detail, many questions of course remain unanswered. For instance, it remains unclear 
which reading domains (bromodomain, PHD, and/or SAND) render specificity of SP140 
binding to chromatin. Furthermore, a nucleosome affinity purification assay did not identify 
SP140 as a direct interactor of methylated H3K27 nucleosomes, at least in HeLa cells (55). 
Therefore, SP140 may dock to repressed loci in macrophages via other yet-to-be identified 
histone modifications. Moreover, we found SP140 to also occupy active enhancers, the 
repertoire of which is highly cell type– and activation state–specific (37, 56). Hence, 
whether SP140 is solely a repressor or whether its function is altered when docked to 
enhancers, particularly through the bromodomain, ultimately to establish macrophage 
identity, needs to be investigated. Another limitation of our study is that experiments were 
performed in either mouse bone marrow–derived macrophages, human peripheral blood–
derived macrophages, or PBMCs stimulated with bacterial or viral ligands. Future studies 
that probe the function of SP140 in immune cells that reside specifically within the intestine 
may provide greater insight into the precise role of this epigenetic reader in homeostatic 
immunity toward commensal microbes. Also, SP140 function in other immune cell types 
could certainly contribute to CD and should be considered. However, because SP140 shows 
only 54% amino acid homology between mouse and human, studies of this protein solely in 
mice will have limitations. In addition, given the association of SP140 SNPs with CLL and 
MS and the high expression of SP140 in B cells and dendritic cells, the investigation of 
SP140 function in these cells is warranted. However, microbiome alterations that affect 
innate immune pathways have been observed in MS patients (57), and other MS-associated 
mutations (e.g., in TNFRSF1A) block TNF, mirroring the clinical experience of MS patients 
where anti-TNF therapies can exacerbate disease (58). Therefore, a genetic deficiency of 
SP140 could conceivably contribute to MS through a reduction in TNF and other innate 
cytokines and merits investigation. Last, given the growing evidence that epigenetic 
reprogramming dictates antigen-independent trained immunity and tolerance (6, 34), genetic 
variants of SP140 or other epigenome regulatory enzymes may have a broader impact on an 
individual’s immune status than currently appreciated.
Together, our findings identify the epigenetic reader SP140 as a critical regulator of 
macrophage function and innate immunity that enables intestinal homeostasis. Our work 
also uncovers a direct link between a loss of SP140 through genetic variation and IBD. 
Given the enthusiasm surrounding the therapeutic tractability of histone binding domains by 
chemical inhibitors (7), it is worth noting that our results suggest that targeting this 
particular bromodomain-containing epigenetic reader may not be desirable, at least in

 subsets of CD (or CLL or MS) patients bearing SP140 SNPs. Furthermore, this work has 
important implications for understanding how alterations in the epigenome and the 
interpretation of the epigenome via readers can drive immune-mediated disease, which may 
inform better therapeutic strategies.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
The human study population consisted of adult patients enrolled in the Prospective Registry 
in IBD Study at Massachusetts General Hospital (PRISM), a single-center ongoing patient 
registry that aims to understand the causes of IBD and factors affecting disease progression. 
Patients were approached during their regularly scheduled clinic visits at the Massachusetts 
General Hospital (MGH) Crohn’s and Colitis Center. Study research coordinators obtained 
consent, and medical history was obtained and confirmed by review of the electronic 
medical record. Animal studies were conducted under protocols approved by the MGH 
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. All in vitro experiments with primary mouse 
or human macrophages included two to six biological replicates performed in triplicate, as 
indicated in the figure legends. All in vivo experiments were performed independently two 
times, with four to seven animals per group.
SP140 ChIP-seq and analysis
Sixty million naïve or LPS-stimulated (100 ng/ml for 4 hours) human M(IFN-γ) 
macrophages were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde (Fisher Scientific) for 10 min at 
room temperature. Formaldehyde was quenched with 1.25 M glycine for 5 min at room 
temperature. Cells were scraped, washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 
protease inhibitors, and frozen. Nuclei were isolated using the truChIP kit (Covaris Inc.), 
and chromatin was sheared at 4°C, 140 W, and 200 cycles per burst with 10% duty factor for 
8 min and 30 s (Covaris Inc.). Input fraction was saved (0.7%), and the remaining sheared 
chromatin was used for ChIP with a polyclonal SP140 antibody (HPA006162, Sigma) or an 
immunoglobulin G isotype control (Millipore) in immunoprecipitation buffer [0.1% Triton 
X-100, 0.1 M tris-HCl (pH 8), 0.5 mM EDTA, and 0.15 M NaCl in 1× Covaris D3 buffer] at 
4°C, rotating overnight, followed by incubation with Dynabeads Protein G (10003D, Life 
Technologies) for 4 hours. The chromatin-bead-antibody complexes were then washed 
sequentially with three wash buffers of increasing salt concentrations and TE buffer. 
Chromatin was eluted using 1% SDS in Tris-EDTA. Cross-linking was reversed by 
incubation with ribonuclease A (Roche) for 1 hour at 37°C, followed by an overnight 
incubation at 65°C with Proteinase K (Roche). DNA was purified with the QIAquick PCR 
Purification Kit (28104, Qiagen). Libraries of input DNA and ChIP DNA were prepared 
from gel-purified >300–base pair (bp) DNA fragments. Samples were multiplexed and 
sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 in the rapid mode to obtain 50-bp single-ended reads.
Peak calling was carried out with bcbio_nextgen (http://gihub.com/chapmanb/bcbio-
nextgen). Briefly, after quality assessment using FastQC 
(www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/), reads were trimmed using cutadapt 
version 1.9.1 (http://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) with a quality cutoff of 5 to remove

 low-quality 3′ ends from reads, retaining reads with a minimum length of 25 bp. Trimmed 
reads were mapped against the UCSC hg19 reference genome using Bowtie 2 version 2.2.7 
(59) with default parameters. Alignments were sorted and filtered to retain only uniquely 
mapping reads using sambamba version 0.5.9 (60). ChIP peaks were called using MACS2 
version 2.1.0 with broad option (61) for the SP140 M(IFN-γ) and M(IFN-γ+LPS 4h) ChIP 
samples versus input control DNA. Furthermore, relevant H3K27ac (GSE54972), H3K4me1 
(GSE31621), H3K4me3 (GSM1146439), and H3K27me3 (GSM1625982 and 
GSM1625986) ChIP-seq data from human monocyte-derived macrophages were obtained 
from the Gene Expression Omnibus and analyzed in the same way. We used the broad 
option for H3K27me3 chip data and default narrow peak parameters for H3K27ac, 
H3K4me1, and H3K4me3. In the case of H3K27ac, we followed similar preprocessing steps 
to those described in a previously published paper (62): (i) paired-end files were converted 
to single end by retaining one read of each proper pair and removing improperly paired 
reads, (ii) regions corresponding to ENCODE blacklisted sites were removed, and (iii) 
replicates were pooled by merging the BAM files before peak calling. Similarly, replicates 
for H3K4me3 were pooled, and peaks were called on the merged BAM files. To filter the set 
of peak calls for each data set and obtain higher confidence peaks, we plotted histograms of 
the fold enrichment (FE) values and defined the background to be the mode of the FE 
values, that is, the value that occurs most often. This resulted in a cutoff of 3 for H3K27me3, 
3.5 for SP140 M(IFN-γ) and SP140 M(IFN-γ+LPS 4h), 5 for H3K27ac and H3K4me1, and 
6 for H3K4me3.
Assay for transposase-accessible chromatin
Human M(IFN-γ) macrophages were left unstimulated [M(IFN-γ)] or stimulated with LPS 
(100 ng/ml for 4 hours) [M(IFN-γ+LPS 4h)] and subjected to ATAC-seq as previously 
described (40). Briefly, 50,000 cells were pelleted, resuspended in 50 μl of lysis buffer [10 
mM tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 3 mM MgCl2, 10 mM NaCl, and 0.1% NP-40 (CA-630, IGEPAL)], 
and immediately centrifuged at 500g for 10 min at 4°C. The nuclei pellets were resuspended 
in 50 μl of transposition buffer (25 μl of 2× 13 tagmentation DNA buffer, 22.5 μl of dH2O, 
and 2.5 μl of Illumina Tn5 transposase) and incubated for 30 min at 37°C. Transposed DNA 
was purified with the MinElute PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen) and eluted in 10 μl of elution 
buffer (Qiagen). Barcoded ATAC-seq libraries were prepared as previously described and 
sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500.
Hematopoietic depletion of Sp140 in mice
To allow for temporal control of shRNA expression in vivo, we used the TRC905 lentiviral 
vector (Broad Institute), whereby shRNA expression is under the control of an IPTG-
inducible promoter. In this system, IPTG binds to the Lac I repressor protein, preventing it 
from binding to three Lac O repressor binding sites surrounding the U6 promoter required 
for shRNA expression (63). The shRNA target 21-nucleotide oligomer sequences were as 
follows: shGFP, GCAAGCTGACCCTGAAGTTCAT; mouse shSP140, 
GATGATTACTCTTGGTCATAT. Plasmids were purified with a QIAprep Maxiprep kit 
(Qiagen) and transfected into human embryonic kidney–293T cells along with pCMV-dR8.2 
dvpr and pCMV-VSVG for the production of lentivirus. Bone marrow progenitor cells 
obtained from CD45.1 C57BL/6 donor mice were placed in 24-well tissue culture dishes (1

 × 106 cells per well) and infected with 400 μl of unconcentrated shRNA lentiviral 
supernatant and polybrene (7.5 μg/ml) on day 1. Cells were spun for 30 min at 800g and 
placed in fresh medium containing 15% fetal bovine serum, IL-3 (20 ng/ml), IL-6 (50 ng/
ml), and stem cell factor (SCF) (50 ng/ml). On day 2, the bone marrow cells were reinfected 
again. On day 3, puromycin (3 μg/ml) was added to the growth medium. On day 4, the cells 
were harvested and washed twice in PBS. For bone marrow transplantation, CD45.2 
C57BL/6 recipient mice were irradiated with 131Cs at 10 gray on day 0 and injected retro-
orbitally with 2.5 × 106 CD45.1 lentivirus–transduced bone marrow in 200 μl of Dulbecco’s 
modified Eagle’s medium, after which the mice were monitored for 6 weeks to allow for 
immune reconstitution. Six weeks after transplantation, blood was analyzed for 
reconstitution by measuring CD45.1 by flow cytometry. Next, we administered IPTG (1 mg 
intraperitoneally and 10 mM IPTG into the drinking water for 1 week) to induce the shRNA. 
All mice were maintained under specific pathogen–free conditions at the animal facility of 
MGH under a protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Statistical analysis
Comparisons and statistical tests were performed as indicated in each figure legend. Briefly, 
for comparisons of multiple groups over time or with two variables, a two-way analysis of 
variance (ANOVA) was used and corrected for multiple post hoc comparisons, comparing all 
groups to each other, all groups to a control, or selected groups to each other. For 
comparisons of multiple groups with only one variable, a one-way ANOVA was performed 
and corrected for multiple post hoc comparisons. For comparisons of two groups, two-tailed 
paired or unpaired t tests were used, except where indicated. Statistical analyses were 
performed in the GraphPad Prism software. A P value of less than 0.05 was considered 
significant, denoted as *P ≤ 0.05, **P ≤ 0.01, ***P ≤ 0.001, and ****P < 0.0001 for all 
analyses. Correlation analyses for SP140 mRNA expression in individuals carrying none, 
one, or two alleles of SP140 SNPs and SP140 ChIP-seq data with various histone 
modifications were performed with Spearman ranking coefficients. FDR correction was 
performed for all RNA-seq data.
