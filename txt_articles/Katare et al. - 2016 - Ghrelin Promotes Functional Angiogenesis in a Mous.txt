Current therapeutic strategies for the treatment of critical limb ischemia (CLI) have only limited
success. Recent in vitro evidence in the literature, using cell lines, proposes that the peptide hor-
mone ghrelin may have angiogenic properties. In this study, we aim to investigate if ghrelin could
promote postischemic angiogenesis in a mouse model of CLI and, further, identify the mechanistic
pathway(s) that underpin ghrelin’s proangiogenic properties. CLI was induced in male CD1 mice by
femoral artery ligation. Animals were then randomized to receive either vehicle or acylated ghrelin
(150 �g/kg sc) for 14 consecutive days. Subsequently, synchrotron radiation microangiography was
used to assess hindlimb perfusion. Subsequent tissue samples were collected for molecular and
histological analysis. Ghrelin treatment markedly improved limb perfusion by promoting the gen-
eration of new capillaries and arterioles (internal diameter less than 50 �m) within the ischemic
hindlimb that were both structurally and functionally normal; evident by robust endothelium-
dependent vasodilatory responses to acetylcholine. Molecular analysis revealed that ghrelin’s an-
giogenic properties were linked to activation of prosurvival Akt/vascular endothelial growth fac-
tor/Bcl-2 signaling cascade, thus reducing the apoptotic cell death and subsequent fibrosis. Further,
ghrelin treatment activated proangiogenic (miR-126 and miR-132) and antifibrotic (miR-30a) mi-
croRNAs (miRs) while inhibiting antiangiogenic (miR-92a and miR-206) miRs. Importantly, in vitro
knockdown of key proangiogenic miRs (miR-126 and miR-132) inhibited the angiogenic potential
of ghrelin. These results therefore suggest that clinical use of ghrelin for the early treatment of CLI
may be a promising and potent inducer of reparative vascularization through modulation of key
molecular factors. (Endocrinology 157: 432–445, 2016)
C
ritical limb ischemia (CLI) is the severe obstruction of
blood flow to the extremities and is a common man-
ifestation of atherosclerosis and advanced peripheral ar-
tery disease, leading to cell death and tissue necrosis of the
effected limb. CLI is characterized by severe pain at rest,
nonhealing wounds and gangrene, progressing to loss of
limb and high rates of mortality. The leading risk factors
for CLI are diabetes, obesity and age. The incidence of CLI
in the western world is approximately 220 new cases per
million people per year and, with a rapidly increasing
prevalence of diabetes and obesity, the population at risk
of CLI is expected to increase (1–3).

 to improve the blood flow to the affected region, are ef-
fective in only approximately half of CLI patients, with at
least25%ofpatientspresentingwithCLIundergoamajor
amputation within a year (4). Moreover, in 30% of all
patients where vascularization is successfully restored,
vessel patency will subsequently fail within one year (5).
Currently there are no effective pharmacological interven-
tions to treat CLI. The advent of gene therapy has emerged
as a novel and potential strategy for treating CLI and in-
volves the delivery of therapeutic genes into the ischemic
vascular region to promote angiogenesis (6). However ,
despite the large number of preclinical studies around the
world advocating several angiogenic factors such as vas-
cular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and fibroblast
growth factor family members, clinical studies have
shown disappointing results (7). Hence, there still remains
the need to identify a new and effective pharmacological
therapy for the successful treatment of CLI.
The peptide hormone ghrelin, first discovered in 1999
as the endogenous ligand for the GH secretagogue recep-
tor (8), has been implicated in a diverse range of physio-
logical homeostatic systems. In particular, ghrelin has
been implicated as an important therapeutic modulator of
cardiac and vascular function in health and disease (8–
10). We have previously shown, using an animal model of
pulmonary hypertension, that ghrelin therapy attenuates
adverse structural vascular remodeling, (11) opposes pul-
monary vessel rarefaction and preserves vascular function
by preventing endothelial dysfunction (12). Hence, opti-
mal blood perfusion throughout the pulmonary circula-
tion is maintained.
Recent evidence in the literature proposes that ghrelin
has potent angiogenic properties in both an in vitro en-
dothelial cell line (13) and an in vivo model of myocardial
infarction (14). In addition, recent studies also showed
that exogenous ghrelin improves endothelial function in
obese (15) and hypertensive (16) patients through resto-
ration of nitric oxide (NO) availability, further supporting
the angiogenic potential of ghrelin. Although these studies
demonstrate a significant increase in vascular density or
angiogenic factors after ghrelin administration, it is un-
clear whether these newly generated vessels are both struc-
turally and functionally normal, which is critical for op-
timizing the modulation of blood flow to affected regions
of ischemia. Moreover, the underlying molecular mecha-
nisms in ghrelin mediated angiogenic effect is not known
and it is now clear that early molecular alterations forms
the basis for the structural and functional impairment in
the later stages (17–19). Further, to date there have not
been any studies that have demonstrated the effect of ghre-
lin in promoting angiogenesis in CLI.
Recently, microRNAs (miRs) are demonstrated to play
a key role in regulating the pathophysiology of various
diseases including vascular diseases (20, 21). miRs are
small (20–25 nucleotide) noncoding RNA molecules that
regulate the gene expression at the posttranscriptional
level (20). Endothelial cell-enriched miR-126 and miR-
132, also known as angiomiRs have been recently studied
for their role in endothelial dysfunction, angiogenesis, and
vascular diseases (21–24).
In this study, we hypothesized that the therapeutic ad-
ministration of exogenous ghrelin would promote periph-
eral angiogenesis in a mouse model of CLI so as to ulti-
mately reestablish blood flow to the affected limb.
Moreover, we further aimed to identify whether alteration
in the expression pattern of miRs is the major molecular
mechanistic pathway that underpin ghrelin’s proangio-
genic properties. It is anticipated that the results from this
study could provide the foundation for future studies to
demonstrate the therapeutic potential of ghrelin in restor-
ing organ perfusion, via angiogenesis, in pathological con-
ditions that are predisposed to CLI, such as obesity and
diabetes.
Materials and Methods
All experiments were approved by the local Animal Ethics Com-
mittee and conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the
Physiological Society of Japan (http://int.physiology.jp/en/
ethics/). Experiments were conducted on 24 male CD1 mice (10
wk old; body weight �37–47 g). All mice were on a 12-hour
light, 12-hour dark cycle at 25 � 1°C and were provided with
food and water ad libitum. Detailed methods are available in
Supplemental Materials and Methods.
Hindlimb ischemia
Using standard aseptic procedures, mice (n � 16) were anes-
thetized with 3% isoflurane/O2 (1-L O2/min) and unilateral limb
ischemia of the upper left femoral artery as previously described
(25–27). Sham mice (control, n � 8) underwent surgical expo-
sure of the femoral artery, but the artery was not ligated. The
consistency of the level of ischemia induced between ischemic
groups was confirmed by measuring superficial limb perfusion in
the region of adductor muscles using an infrared thermal sensi-
tive camera (Guide Infrared Co, Ltd) immediately after the in-
duction of limb ischemia (Supplemental Figure 1) (28). Ischemic
animals were then randomized to receive daily sc injections of
either acylated ghrelin (Ghr, 150 �g/kg � d; CLI�Ghr, n � 8) or
saline (Sal, CLI�Sal, n � 8) for a total of 14 days.
Synchrotron radiation microangiography
On the day of the angiography experiment, mice were anes-
thetized with 2,2,2 tribromoethanol (0.3 g/kg, ip and intubated;
Avertin) (27). The right femoral artery was cannulated with a
fine PE10 catheter and advanced to the bifurcation of the
common iliac artery and abdominal aorta, so that injection of

 iodinated contrast medium (Iomeron 350), using a high-speed
injector, would selectively perfuse the left (ie, ischemic) limb
circulation. The hindlimb circulation was visualized using syn-
chrotron radiation microangiography at the Super Photon ring-8
GeV (SPring-8) facility BL28B2 beam line, Hyogo, Japan. The
properties of synchrotron radiation that allow superior angiog-
raphy image quality of microvessels, in vivo, are extensively de-
scribed in a recent review (29).
Protocol
After positioning of the mice (Supplemental Figure 2), con-
trast agent was injected as a single bolus dose using an autoin-
jector (a Harvard PHD200 pump; Harvard Apparatus) into the
iliac artery for imaging of right hindlimb vessels. For each 2-sec-
ond period of scanning (a single exposure sequence), 100 frames
were recorded. Mice were given at least 10 minutes to recover
from each bolus injection of contrast agent.
After a baseline image of the left limb circulation to determine
the effect of ghrelin, subsequent hindlimb angiograms were re-
corded in response to: 1) acetylcholine (ACh) (10.0 �g/kg � min
for 5 min, iv) to assess endothelium-dependent vasodilation, 2)
the NO donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP) (5 �g/kg � min for 5
min, iv) to assess endothelium-independent vasodilation, and 3)
the NO synthase (NOS) inhibitor, N�-nitro-L-arginine methyl
ester (L-NAME) (50 mg/kg, iv). Microangiography was per-
formed after the fifth min of ACh and SNP infusion and 20
minutes after the bolus dose of L-NAME. At least 10–15 minutes
was required for all cardiovascular variables to return to baseline
values after ACh and SNP drug interventions.
At the completion of the imaging protocol, animals were eu-
thanizedandtheadductormuscleswerecollectedforhistological
and molecular analysis.
Data analysis
All the angiogram data were analyzed using the computer-
imaging program Image Proplus (version 7.0.1; Media Cyber-
netics) by a researcher who was blinded to the treatment condi-
tion of the animals.
Histological analysis
Muscle cryosections with a thickness of 5 �m were used for
immunohistochemical analysis unless specified. All the analysis
of muscle cryosections were done by a researcher who was
blinded to the treatment condition of the animals.
Assessment of capillary and arteriole density
The capillary and arteriole densities of ischemic adductor
muscles were assessed using isolectin-B4 and �-smooth muscle
actin (Sigma-Aldrich) staining, respectively, as previously de-
scribed (30, 31). Counts of 15 random microscopic fields were
averaged and expressed as the number of capillaries and arteri-
oles per mm2. Arterioles were divided in to 3 subgroups, char-
acterized according to their luminal size (�50 �m, 51–100 �m,
and �100 �m; n � 8 mice in each group).
Assessment of skeletal muscle fibrosis
Cryosectionswerestainedwithpicosiriusred.Skeletalmuscle
fibrosis was analyzed by Sirius red staining using established
protocol, followed by morphometric analysis using the ImageJ
analysis software (NIH) and the data were expressed as the per-
centage of the fibrotic area per section (19).
Assessment of skeletal muscle apoptosis
Skeletal myocytes and endothelial cells apoptosis was quan-
tified by the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated
dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) technique (Click-iT Plus
TUNEL Assay; Life Technologies), according to the manufac-
turer’s instruction. Same sections were then stained with DAPI to
recognize nuclei and isolectin to recognize endothelial cells. Ten
fields were randomly evaluated in each section at �400 magni-
fication. The fraction of TUNEL positive myocyte or endothelial
cell nuclei was then calculated (32, 33).
Assessment of skeletal muscle proliferation
To determine whether ghrelin augmented the proliferation of
myocytes after ischemia, cryosections were incubated overnight
with Ki67 (1:100; Novus Biologicals), followed by incubation
with goat antirabbit secondary antibody conjugated with Alexa
Flour 568 (1:100; Life Technologies) for 1 hour at room tem-
perature. Myocytes were identified by staining with actin (1:100;
Novus Biologicals). Finally, sections were stained with DAPI
(1:1000; Life Technologies) for nuclei identification. The data
were expressed as the number of Ki67 nuclei per 1 million myo-
cytes (18, 23) (for antibodies, please see Table 1).

 Molecular analysis
Western blotting analysis for cell survival factors
Proteins were extracted from adductor muscle using ice-cold
radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer. Detection of proteins by
western blot analysis was done after separation of whole tissue
extracts (50 �g) on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were trans-
ferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham-Phar-
macia) and probed with the next antibodies: Ser473-phospho-Akt
(1:1000; Cell Signaling), Akt (1:100; Life Technologies), VEGF (1:
1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc), and cleaved-caspase-3 (1:
1000; Cell Signaling). �-Actin (1:1000; Cell Signaling) was used as
loadingcontrol.Fordetection,goatantirabbitorantimouseordon-
key antigoat secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish perox-
idase(1:5000;bothfromSantaCruzBiotechnology,Inc)wereused,
followed by chemiluminescence reaction (Amersham Pharmacia).
Density of the bands was analyzed using ImageJ (NIH) software,
and data were expressed as fold changes.
TaqMan array microfluidic card miR profiling
miR profiling was performed using the TaqMan Array Mi-
croRNA Cards customized for miRs that have an established role
in angiogenesis and cell survival (Supplemental Table 1), following
themanufacturer’sprotocolforprofilingwithoutpreamplification.
Each RNA sample was reverse transcribed using RT primer
pool followed by amplification of cDNA using the Microfluidic
Array card according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Quantification cycle (Cq) values were determined using the
ViiA 7 Software v1.2 applying a fixed threshold level of 0.05.
Datawerethenanalyzedusingthe2��Cqmethod(34,35)inboth
the ischemic groups relative to the sham group. miRs with Cq
value more than 35 in every sample analyzed were excluded from
analysis.
In vitro studies
Cell culture
Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were pur-
chased from Lonza and cultured in endothelial cell growth me-
dium (EGM-II; Lonza) as described earlier. Cells were always
used at fourth or fifth passage for the experiments.
Determining the optimal concentration of ghrelin
To determine the optimal concentration of ghrelin for the in
vitro studies, HUVECs (4 � 103 cells) were plated in a 96-well
culture dish for 24 hours, followed by treatment with different
concentration of ghrelin (1nM, 10nM, 100nM, and 1000nM)
for further 72 hours. PBS was used as the vehicle for in vitro
experiments. After 72 hours, the effect of ghrelin on cell prolif-
eration was quantified using the CyQUANT Cell proliferation
assay kit (Life Technologies) following the manufacturer’s in-
structions. In brief, 200 �L of the diluted CyQUANT staining
reagent were added to each sample and control well. After a

 5-minute incubation period in the dark at room temperature, the
fluorescence intensity was measured using a 485/20-nm excita-
tion filter and a 520/20-nm emission filter. The number of cells
in each well was calculated using a standard curve of cell number
vs fluorescence (ranging from 1000 to 40 000 cells). Result was
expressed as mean fold increase in cell number at the end of 72
hours.
In vitro modulation of inhibition of miR-126 and
miR-132
To verify the mechanisms implicated in ghrelin induced an-
giogenesis, we conducted loss- and gain-of-function studies. For
gain-of-function studies HUVECs were transfected with miR-
126, miR-132, or the relevant scrambled miRNA mimics
(5pM/well in a 96-well culture dish; Life Technologies) using
commercially available Lipofectamine RNAiMAX reagent (Life
Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s protocol and our
earlier studies (18, 23). This study will answer whether overex-
pression of miRs will produce comparable effects as ghrelin
treatment. For loss-of-function study, we silenced 2 key proan-
giogenic miRs, miR-126 and miR-132, using anti-miRs (as
in gain-of-function study; Life Technologies). After transfection,
cells were treated with either vehicle (PBS, gain-of-function
study) or ghrelin (100nM, concentration chosen based on the
optimization study above, loss-of-function study) and randomly
assigned to evaluate the effect of treatment on angiogenesis po-
tential (Matrigel tube formation assay), cell death (caspase-3/7
activity; Promega) and proliferation (CyQUANT assay; Life
Technologies).
Matrigel tube formation assay
To investigate whether inhibition of miR-126 and miR-132
affects the angiogenic potential of ghrelin, transfected HUVECs
were cultured with or without ghrelin on Matrigel (BD Biosci-
ences) for 24 hours. Cumulative tube length formation was cal-
culated using Image-Pro Plus software (23).
Cell proliferation assay
HUVECs pretreated with anti-miR-132, anti-miR-126, or
scrambled sequence were seeded in a 96-well culture dish at
15 000 cells/well and supplemented with medium containing ei-
ther ghrelin (100nM) or vehicle. Cells were supplemented every
day with fresh medium containing ghrelin or vehicle. At the end
of72hourseffectofmiRinhibitiononcellproliferationpotential
of ghrelin was measured using CyQUANT Cell proliferation
assay kit (Life Technologies).

 Caspase-3/7 activity
For caspase activity assay, 5 � 103 cells were plated on 96-
well dish and underwent similar transfection and treatment pro-
cedure. At the end of treatment, equal volume of caspase assay
reagent was added to the wells and incubated in dark for 30
minutes at room temperature. The luminescence was read using
BioTek synergy 2 Multi-Mode Microplate Reader (18, 31), and
data were expressed as fold changes to cells treated with vehicle.
Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were conducted using Prism GraphPad
(v6.0a; GraphPad Software, Inc). One-way ANOVA (factorial)
was used to test for significant differences in 1) vessel caliber under
basal conditions compared with each of the experimental condi-
tions(eg,AChandSNP),2)thehistologicalandmoleculardata,and
3) values for control compared with CLI�Sal and CLI�Ghr mice.
Where statistical significance was reached, post hoc analyses were
incorporated using the paired, or unpaired t test with the Dunnet’s
correction for multiple comparisons. P � .05 was predetermined as
the level of significance for all statistical analysis.
Results
Ghrelin treatment augmented the development of
functional new vessels postischemia superficial
limb perfusion
Superficial limb perfusion measurement on day 14 after
ischemia showed increased blood flow in the saline-
treated ischemic adductor muscles, represented as isch-
emia to contralateral ratio (Figure 1A). This effect was
further augmented by ghrelin treatment (1.98 � 0.3 vs
1.29 � 0.1, CLI�Ghr vs CLI-Sal; P � .01) (Figure 1A).
Angiographic assessment of angiogenesis
Using synchrotron radiation angiography, we were
able to clearly assess blood perfusion distribution and,
hence, vessel density of the hindlimb circulation in sham
mice (control) and limb ischemic mice that were treated
with saline or ghrelin for 14 consecutive days (Figure 1B).
One-way ANOVA showed a significant difference in the
generation of new microvessels, primarily of the fourth
generation of branching and typically having an internal
diameter (ID) � 80 �m, within the experiment groups
(P � .05). Although ischemia itself tended to stimulate the
angiogenesis, as evident by a small increase in the number
of radiopaque (micro)vessels (9.7 � 1.1 vessels) (Figure 1,
Bi and Bii), post hoc analysis did not show any significant
difference compared with control mice (7.6 � 0.9 vessels,
not significant [NS]) (Figure 1, Bii and Biii). In contrast,
the magnitude of “angiogenesis” was significantly aug-
mented in ghrelin-treated mice (ie, 13.9 � 1.3 vessels in
CLI�Ghr mice; P � .05) (Figure 1, Bii and Biii). There was
no difference in either mean arterial blood pressure
(MABP) or heart rate (HR) between control mice and both
groups of limb ischemic mice (Supplemental Table 2).
Endothelium-dependent vasodilation
ACh (10.0 �g/kg � min for 5 min, iv) was used to assess
endothelium-dependent vasodilation, particularly of the
newly formed microvessels within the ischemic hindlimb.
ACh caused significant vasodilation in all measured ves-
sels of the hindlimb, which was of similar magnitude for
both control and ghrelin-treated mice, eg, an approxi-

 mately 45% increase in the ID of 30- to 50-�m vessels
(Figure 2A). In saline-treated mice, although vasodilation
of ID � 50-�m vessels was comparatively “normal,” the
vasodilatory capacity of newly formed “microvessels,” ie,
ID � 50 �m was relatively nonresponsive to ACh (15%
increase in ID; P � .05 vs control mice). In all mice, ACh
caused a significant decrease in systemic MABP (�40% de-
crease) and mild decrease in HR (Supplemental Table 2).

 formed microvessels, independent of the endothelium.
SNP caused significant hindlimb vasodilation in all mea-
sured vessels that was of similar magnitude for control and
limb ischemic mice; treated with or without ghrelin (one-
way ANOVA, NS) (Figure 2B). Importantly, although the
vasodilatory response of the newly formed 30- to 50-�m-
sized vessels to ACh (ie, endothelial function) was im-
pairedinthesaline-treatedmice,thevasodilatoryresponse
to SNP (ie, vascular smooth muscle) was “functionally”
normal. SNP caused a significant approximately 25% de-
crease in MABP for all groups of mice, although HR was
not altered (Supplemental Table 2).
Responses to endogenous NOS inhibition
The inhibition of endogenous endothelial nitric oxide
synthase, using L-NAME (50 mg/kg, iv), caused severe
hindlimbvasoconstrictionofvesselswithanID�100�m,
which was of similar magnitude for all groups of mice
(one-way ANOVA, NS) (Figure 2C). Interestingly, the 50-
to 100-�m vessels in control mice did not significantly
constrict in response to L-NAME. However, these vessels
did significantly constrict in limb ischemic mice treated
with or without ghrelin (28% and 31% decrease in vessel
ID, respectively), reflecting the high dependence of the 50-
to 100-�m vessels on endogenous NO for maintaining
vascular tone. The magnitude of vasoconstriction could
not be assessed in the small 30- to 50-�m microvessels,
because these vessels were often no longer visible after
L-NAME administration due to the potent vasoconstric-
tion preventing adequate perfusion of the vessel with io-
dinated contrast agent. L-NAME significantly increased
MABP in all mice (�45% increase), which was accompa-
nied by a reflex decrease in HR (�20% decrease; P � .05)
(Supplemental Table 2).
Ghrelin treatment increased neovascularization
To further confirm the angiogenic properties of ghrelin,
cryosections from the adductor muscles were stained for
endothelial marker isolectin, as well as �-smooth muscle
actin so as to identify and distinguish between capillaries
and arterioles, respectively. One-way ANOVA confirmed
significant increase in the number of capillaries and small
sized (ID � 50 �m) arterioles in all the experiment groups
(P � .05). Although post hoc analysis confirmed signifi-
cant increase in the number of capillaries even with the
saline treatment after ischemia (824 � 84 vs 558 � 78 for
CLI�Sal vs control, respectively; P � .01) (Figure 3A),
there was no significant increase the number of small sized
(ID � 50 �m) arterioles (10.9 � 4.5 vs 7.1 � 0.7, for
CLI�Sal vs control, respectively) (Figure 3B). However,
treatment with ghrelin not only enhanced the generation
of new capillaries (1014 � 148, P � .01 vs both sham and
CLI�Sal groups) (Figure 3A) but also significantly in-
creased the number of small sized arterioles (22 � 3, P �
.001 vs both sham and CLI�Sal groups) (Figure 3B).
Ghrelin treatment activated cell survival factors
and decreased fibrosis
To determine whether the ghrelin-mediated improve-
ment in limb blood flow and perfusion was associated
with reduction in the loss of muscle cells, we measured the
expression level of prosurvival and apoptotic proteins by
western blotting. As illustrated in Figure 4, ghrelin treat-

VEGF (Figure 4B), and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 (P � .05 vs
bothcontrolandCLI�Salgroupforallparameter)(Figure
4C), which was associated with decreased levels of pro-
apoptotic cleaved caspase-3 expression (P � .01 vs
CLI�Sal group) (Figure 4D) and TUNEL positive myo-
cytes and endothelial cells (P � .05 vs CLI�Sal group)
(Supplemental Figure 3). Although the expression of Akt
was also elevated in saline-treated muscles (P � .01 vs
control group) (Figure 4A), it did not affect apoptotic cell
death as evidenced by increased cleaved caspase-3 expres-
sion (P � .01 vs control group) (Figure 4D) and TUNEL
positive myocytes (Supplemental Figure 3), suggesting
that ischemia results in the loss of myocytes.
A decrease in the number of myocytes promotes the
formation of tissue fibrosis. This was evident in our study,
where saline-treated ischemic muscles showed a 3-fold in-
crease in the level of fibrosis (P � .01 vs control group)
(Figure 4E), which was markedly reduced by ghrelin treat-
ment (6 � 1.8% CLI�Sal group vs 2.3 � 0.4% CLI�Ghr
group; P � .001) (Figure 4E). These results are further
supported by increased proliferation of myocytes in ghre-
lin-treated mice, as evidenced by increased Ki-67-express-
ing myocytes (Figure 4F).
Ghrelin treatment modulates angiogenic and cell
survival miRs
Angiogenic growth factors (eg, VEGF) and cellular
kinases (eg, Akt) stimulate the expression of target genes
by inducing phosphorylation of the transcription factor
cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) at Ser133
(24). In doing so, VEGF induces the sustained up-regula-
tion of proangiogenic miR-132 in ECs, which results in
suppression of p120RasGAP and subsequent induction of
endothelial cells proliferation and angiogenesis in vitro
and in vivo (23). Further, ischemic stress leads to the ac-
tivation of miR-126, which has been demonstrated to be
associated with increased VEGF expression (36, 37).
Hence, we next aimed to assess whether ghrelin’s angio-
genic properties are linked to activation of miR-132 and
miR-126. For this purpose, we performed a microarray
analysis of adductor muscle using the TaqMan Array Mi-
croRNA Cards customized for miRs that have an estab-
lished role in angiogenesis and cell survival (Supplemental
Table 1). As shown in Figure 5, ghrelin-treated mice
showed significant up-regulation of both proangiogenic
miR-126 and miR-132 (Figure 5A) and antifibrotic miRs
(miR-30a) (Figure 5C). Importantly, ghrelin treatment
prevented the activation of antiangiogenic (miR-92a and
miR-206) (Figure 5B) and profibrotic miRs (miR-21 and
miR-206) (Figure 5C), which were significantly up-regu-
lated in saline-treated mice (Figure 5, B and C).
In vitro inhibition of proangiogenic miRs reduce
the angiogenic potential of ghrelin
Finally, to verify that activation of miR-126 and miR-
132 play a significant role in the angiogenic potential of
ghrelin, we selectively inhibited miR-126 and miR-132 in
HUVECs using anti-miRs. In addition, separate group of
HUVECs were also overexpressed with only miR-126 and
miR-132 without ghrelin, to determine if the effects are
comparable
with
ghrelin
treatment.
Supplementing
HUVECs with ghrelin caused a dose-dependent augmen-
tation of proliferation, with the peak effect at 100nM (P �
.05 vs vehicle and ghrelin at 1nM and 10nM) (Figure 6A).
At this concentration, ghrelin also markedly improved an-
giogenic potential (P � .01 vs vehicle) (Figure 6C) and
survival (P � .01 vs vehicle) (Figure 6D), and of HUVECs.
RT-PCR analysis confirmed that ghrelin significant in-
creases in the expression of miR-126 (3.37 � 0.4-fold

Importantly,alltheeffectsofghrelinwascomparablewith

(P � .05 for all the parameters) (Fig-

genic potential of ghrelin, evident by
a reduction in proliferation (Figure
6B), tube formation (Figure 6C), and
survival (Figure 6D) of HUVECs
(P � .05 for all the parameters) (Fig-
ure 6C). Interestingly, inhibition of
miR-126 not only had the greatest
attenuation on cell proliferation and

the expression of miR-132 (0.6 �

126 is an important upstream regu-
lator of miR-132. These in vitro re-

Discussion
The fundamental goal of angiogene-
sis as a therapeutic strategy for treat-
ingimpairedflowinconduitarteries,
is to promote the formation of new
blood vessels or structural altera-
tions to existing blood vessels, which
involves the combination and coor-
dination of angiogenesis, arteriogen-
esis, and vasculogenesis, so as to ul-
timately restore adequate perfusion
to previously ischemic tissue (4). The
results from this study implicate
ghrelin as an effective therapeutic
agentforpotentlystimulatingthede-
velopment of new capillaries and ar-
terioles in the ischemic limb. Molec-
ular analysis further revealed that
activation of proangiogenic and an-
tifibrotic miRs are key cellular mech-
anistic pathways underpinning this
protective effect. Importantly, these
newly developed microvessels were
not only structurally well developed but also function-
ally normal with an intact endothelium and NO
dependent.

 Ghrelin was first discovered as the endogenous ligand
for the GH secretagogue receptor by Kojima et al (8).
However, in the last decade several studies have identified
numerous other physiological roles of ghrelin, indepen-
dent of GH, particularly in pathological states (38–41)
including cardiovascular diseases (42). A recent study by
Togliatto et al (43) showed the ability of unacylated ghre-
lin in regeneration of the skeletal muscle, and few in vitro
studies have hinted at acylated ghrelin’s angiogenic po-
tential (13, 44, 45). However, our study is the first to
demonstrate the effects of acylated ghrelin in an in vivo
model of CLI, and further identify the underlying mech-
anistic pathways.
After obstruction of a major artery, restoration of ad-
equate blood flow to the ischemic tissue is highly depen-
dent on the formation of collateral vessels. Moreover, the
intrinsic modulation of blood flow through these newly
formed collateral vessels, to optimize tissue perfusion, is
critically dependent on a fully functional endothelium
(46–49). In our study, evidence of angiogenesis was evi-
dent in both groups of limb ischemic mice. However, the
vasodilatory response of these newly formed vessels in the
saline-treated mice was comparatively impaired, indica-
tive of either a nonfunctional or dysfunctional endothe-
lium in these vessels. In contrast, the ACh-induced vaso-
dilation was comparatively normal in ghrelin-treated
mice, suggesting a functionally intact endothelium in the
newly formed blood vessels. These results further explain
the reason why ghrelin-treated mice, that had an intact
vascular endothelium, had improved modulation of limb
blood flow compared with saline-treated mice.
Diminished perfusion leads to hypoxia, and prolonged
hypoxia activates proapoptotic signaling cascade to trig-
ger the cell death (50–52). In our study, femoral artery
occlusion markedly increased the expression of proapop-
totic caspase-3 in the ischemic muscles. Yu et al (53)
recently demonstrated the ability of ghrelin to inhibit
doxorubicin induced apoptosis in skeletal muscles. In ac-
cordance with this, we showed in this study that ghrelin
significantly reduced apoptotic cell death in vivo in isch-
emic muscles, which is likely through the activation of
antiapoptotic factor Bcl-2. This notion is supported by the
marked activation of its upstream regulator Akt in the
ghrelin-treated muscles. Interestingly, Lee et al (54)
showed that ghrelin stimulates insulin secretion and insu-
lin is a potent activator of Akt. Therefore, it is possible that
Akt activation by ghrelin is mediated through increased
secretion of insulin. This also leads to the possible assump-
tion that ghrelin could mediate the level of blood glucose
through activation of insulin, although further studies are
required to confirm this hypothesis.
Another interesting finding is that,
although saline-treated mice showed
marked activation of Akt, there was
no activation of Bcl-2 which acts to
reduce apoptosis. This is not surpris-
ing, as Pugazhenthi et al (55) showed
that up-regulation of Bcl-2 by Akt re-
quires phosphorylation of CREB. Al-
thoughwedidnotmeasuretheexpres-
sion of CREB, miR analysis showed
no activation of proangiogenic miR-
132 in the saline-treated mice. miR-
132 induces the phosphorylation of
CREB through inhibition of anti-
angiogenic p120RasGTPase-activating
protein (23, 56, 57), thus explaining
the reason for increased cell death in
saline-treated animals irrespective of
Aktactivation.Byinhibitingapopto-
sis, ghrelin prevented the loss of
myocytes and hence its replacement
by fibrotic scar tissue in the ischemic
muscles.
We and others have shown that
selected molecular alterations occur-
ring early after an ischemic insult
Figure 7. Summary showing the mechanisms underlying ghrelin induced angiogenesis and cell
survival in ischemic muscle. Ghrelin activates proangiogenic and antifibrotic miRs (red arrows)
while inhibiting the activation of proangiogenic and profibrotic miRs (green line), thus
modulating the downstream signaling cascades involved in angiogenesis and cell survival.

 forms the basis for the functional and structural altera-
tions (17–19). Recent evidence implicates miRs as major
contributors to these early molecular alterations (20). In
our study, ghrelin treatment activated the expression of
proangiogenic miRs such as miR-126 and miR-132. miR-
126 is mainly expressed in endothelial cells and is dem-
onstrated to accelerate angiogenesis by increasing the
PI3K/Akt/VEGF signaling pathway through inhibition of
Sprouty-related protein (SPRED1) (22). Enhanced VEGF
activity leads to sustained activation of miR-132, which is
rapidly transcribed by CREB to suppress endothelial
p120RasGAP expression, ultimately leading to Ras acti-
vation and induction of neovascularization (24). Our in
vitro studies, which selectively inhibited proangiogenic
miRs, not only provided important insight regarding the
molecular mechanism for ghrelin’s angiogenic potential,
but also implicates miR-126 as a possible upstream reg-
ulator for miR-132, although future in vivo knockdown
studies are warranted to confirm this notion. Further, a
recent study by Wang et al (58) demonstrated the antiox-
idant property of miR-126 on HUVECs. Hence, in addi-
tion to inhibition of Ras activation, it is conceivable that
miR-126 also improves angiogenesis by inhibiting the ac-
tivation of reactive oxygen species.
In addition, ghrelin also inhibited the activation of an-
tiangiogenic miR-206 and miR-92a. miR-206 was dem-
onstrated to negatively regulate the angiogenesis through
direct inhibition of VEGF (59), and miR-92a, another en-
dothelial cell-specific miR negatively regulates integrin,
�5, which is essential for the activation of Akt (60). Fur-
thermore, diminished fibrosis by ghrelin was mediated by
inhibition of profibrotic miR-21 while activation of anti-
fibrotic miR-30a. miR-21 plays a vital role in the devel-
opment of fibrosis by promoting the proliferation of in-
terstitial fibroblasts and is regulated by TGF-�, (61),
whereas miR-30a directly inhibit Smad-2, a downstream
regulator in TGF-� induced fibrotic signaling cascade
(62). Thus, as summarized in Figure 7, ghrelin treatment
modulates a variety of angiogenic and fibrotic miRs,
which through an integrated mechanism, promotes an-
giogenesis and cell survival in ischemic adductor muscles.
Clinically, CLI represents the most advanced form of
peripheral arterial disease and is associated with severe
morbidity and mortality despite improvements in medical
care and revascularization. This incidence is further exac-
erbated in patients with chronic comorbidities as diabetes,
hypertension and hyperlipidemia (63). Current therapies
for the treatment of CLI are surgical and endovascular
procedures and medical management is limited to pre-
venting the symptomatic treatment or other associated
cardiovascular complications (64). Of note, no medical
therapies are effective in improving perfusion to the lower
extremity (65–67). We have shown that medical treat-
ment with ghrelin from the early stages of CLI is a potent
inducer of reparative vascularization through modulation
of key molecular factors (Figure 6). Our results therefore
provide a platform for future studies that examine the
long-term angiogenic potential of ghrelin to determine if it
could become a novel therapeutic agent for the treatment
of CLI.
