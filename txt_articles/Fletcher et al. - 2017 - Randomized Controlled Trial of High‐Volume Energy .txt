Background-—Caffeine in doses <400 mg is typically not considered arrhythmogenic, but little is known about the additional
ingredients in energy drinks. We evaluated the ECG and blood pressure (BP) effects of high-volume energy drink consumption
compared with caffeine alone.
Methods and Results-—This was a randomized, double-blind, controlled, crossover study in 18 young, healthy volunteers.
Participants consumed either 946 mL (32 ounces) of energy drink or caffeinated control drink, both of which contained 320 mg of
caffeine, separated by a 6-day washout period. ECG, peripheral BP, and central BP measurements were obtained at baseline and 1,
2, 4, 6, and 24 hours post study drink consumption. The time-matched, baseline-adjusted changes were compared. The change in
corrected QT interval from baseline in the energy drink arm was significantly higher than the caffeine arm at 2 hours
(0.44�18.4 ms versus �10.4�14.8 ms, respectively; P=0.02). The QTc changes were not different at other time points. While
both the energy drink and caffeine arms raised systolic BP in a similar fashion initially, the systolic BP was significantly higher at
6 hours when compared with the caffeine arm (4.72�4.67 mm Hg versus 0.83�6.09 mm Hg, respectively; P=0.01). Heart rate,
diastolic BP, central systolic BP, and central diastolic BP showed no evidence of a difference between groups at any time point.
Post energy drink, augmentation index was lower at 6 hours.
Conclusions-—The corrected QT interval and systolic BP were significantly higher post high-volume energy drink consumption
when compared with caffeine alone. Larger clinical trials validating these findings and evaluation of noncaffeine ingredients within
energy drinks are warranted.

here are currently more than 500 energy drink products
available on the market purported to boost physical and
mental alertness.1 In line with their increased popularity is a
coinciding rise in energy drink–associated emergency depart-
ment visits and deaths, which has led to questions about their
true safety profile.2–4 In a review of energy drink–associated
adverse cardiovascular events, abnormal heart rhythms such
as atrial and ventricular fibrillation, ST elevation, and QT
prolongation have been reported.5 However, the exact
relationship between energy drinks and these adverse events
has gone primarily unexplained.
Energy drinks usually consist of caffeine plus proprietary
energy blends that vary between products. Caffeine has been
around for centuries and is generally recognized as safe in
doses less than 400 mg by the Food and Drug Administration.6
Caffeine, a natural methylxanthine, acts as a central nervous
stimulant in humans by antagonizing adenosine receptors,
leading to additional cardiovascular effects such as peripheral
vasoconstriction and subsequent increased blood pressure
(BP).7,8 Caffeine alone is not suspected to induce any ECG
changes in healthy volunteers at a dose of 400 mg.9 Typically,
caffeine toxicity–related adverse events have only been
observed in case studies where doses far exceed 400 mg.10,11
Although the cardiovascular safety profile of caffeine has
been relatively well established, there is little published
literature
on
the
electrophysiologic
and
hemodynamic
changes with multi-ingredient energy drinks. We conducted
a randomized controlled trial assessing the cardiovascular
safety of high-volume energy drink consumption.

 Methods
Study Oversight and Patient Population
The protocol and informed consent forms were approved by
the David Grant Medical Center Institutional Review Board
(protocol No. FDG20130042H). All participants provided
written informed consent.
Participants were recruited via email and flyers between
2013 and 2014 on a US Air Force Base installation. Healthy
volunteers between the ages of 18 and 40 years were
included. Participants were excluded if they had a current or
previous diagnosis of abnormal heart rhythm, a BP >140/
90 mm Hg, any comorbid medical conditions, history of
substance abuse, renal or hepatic dysfunction, concurrent use
of drugs or over-the-counter products that may interact with
study drinks or affect ECG or BP parameters (excluding oral
contraceptives), or were pregnant or lactating.
Study Design
This was a randomized, double-blind, caffeine-controlled,
crossover study
in healthy
adults.
Using
a computer-
generated randomization code, participants were assigned
to consume either a 1-time 32-ounce (946 mL) dose of a
commercially available energy drink (containing 108 g of
sugar, vitamin B2, vitamin B3, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12,
and a proprietary energy blend of taurine, panax ginseng
extract,
L-carnitine, caffeine [320 mg], glucuronolactone,
inositol, guarana extract, and maltodextrin) or a matching
32-ounce (946 mL) control drink containing 320 mg of
caffeine, 40 mL of lime juice, and 140 mL of cherry syrup
in carbonated water (Figure 1). Other than the caffeine, all
added ingredients in the control group were expected to have
no impact on any end points and were simply added to match
the active drink. The dose was based on the observation that
cardiovascular adverse effects typically occur with high
consumption of energy drink/caffeine.5 The amount of energy
drink participants were asked to consume (2 cans totaling
320 mg caffeine) correlates to the average daily caffeine
consumption (300 mg) of the US population.12 Further, nearly
15% of military personnel consume 3 cans a day in the
deployed setting, which may predispose them to a higher risk
threshold.5,13 After a minimum 6-day washout period, partic-
ipants proceeded to consume the alternate study drink.
Participants were required to fast for 12 hours, and abstain
from any caffeinated products 48 hours prior to each study
day and throughout the 24-hour follow-up period. All study
drinks were presented in identical containers and were
consumed
over
a
45-minute
period.
End
points
were
measured on each study day at baseline (immediately prior
to study drink consumption), and 1, 2, 4, 6, and 24 hours post
consumption of study drink. Due to the possibility of circadian
rhythm changes, the start time for each patient was
approximately the same on the 2 study days (maximum
difference ≤80 minutes).
End Points and Assessments
The primary end point was the QTc interval. Secondary end
points were uncorrected QT interval, PR interval, QRS
duration, heart rate (HR), peripheral systolic BP (pSBP),
peripheral diastolic BP (pDBP), central systolic BP (cSBP),
central diastolic BP (cDBP), and augmentation index (AI).
Participants were also asked to describe any adverse events
they were experiencing at each time point.
A 12-lead ECG (Philips PageWriter Trim III, Philips Medical
Systems, Andover, MA) was obtained with the participant in the
supine position. The machine was calibrated to a 1-mV/cm
standardization with a paper speed of 25 mm/s. Peripheral BP
measurements were obtained in duplicate after a 5-minute rest
using a standard automated vital signs monitor (Masimo SET
Vital Sign Monitor; Welch Allyn; Skaneateles Falls, NY). Central
BP measurements were obtained using the SphygmoCor PWA
system (AtCor Medical Pty Ltd, West Ryde, Australia).
SphygmoCor is a validated system that uses applanation
tonometry to noninvasively translate a radial pressure wave-
form taken at the wrist to an aortic pressure waveform. AI was
corrected to a HR of 75 beats per minute.
Statistical Analysis
Based on some of our previous data, we expected a change in
the energy drink arm of 10 ms and no change in the caffeine
control arm. To detect a between-group difference of 10 ms

 and assuming an SD of 14 ms (2-sided a=5% and 80% power),
we would need 18 participants for the study. The time-
matched changes from baseline were compared between the
energy drink and control arms using the Wilcoxon signed rank
test. All data were reported as mean�SD unless otherwise
stated. Applanation tonometry requires operator proficiency
and only those with an operator index of 70% or greater were
included. Intention-to-treat analysis using the last-observa-
tion-carried-forward methodology was performed to account
for the missing values.
Results
Baseline Characteristics
Twelve men and 6 women (n=18) were included, of which 11
identified as white, 3 as Asian, 2 as Hispanic, 1 as black, and
1
undisclosed.

were
26.7�4.0 years,
171.9�12.2 cm,
and
74.4�15.0 kg,
respectively. Nine were regular coffee drinkers (≥1 cup of
coffee per day), 5 were occasional drinkers, and 4 reported no
coffee consumption. Four reported regular energy drink use
(≥1 can per day), 5 occasional energy drink use, and 9 no
energy drink use. Data imputation was performed for less
than 4% of central BP parameters. At each time point, the
change from baseline is reported in Table 1.
Baseline QTc interval, uncorrected QT interval, PR interval,
QRS duration, and HR were 413�17.3 ms, 405�26.9 ms,
158�21.0 ms, 89.1�9.69 ms, and 63.4�10.5 beats per min-
ute, respectively. Baseline pSBP, pDBP, cSBP, cDBP, and AI were
117�9.89 mm Hg, 72.0�8.56 mm Hg, 103�9.00 mm Hg,
73.4�8.60 mm Hg, and 5.50�10.1, respectively.
ECG Effects
A significant difference in the baseline-adjusted QTc interval
(Figure 2) was evident 2 hours after energy drink consump-
tion when compared with caffeine (0.44�18.4 ms versus
�10.4�14.8 ms, respectively; P=0.02). There was no evi-
dence of a statistically significant difference in the baseline-
adjusted HR 2 hours after energy drink consumption when
compared with caffeine (3.39�11.04 versus �0.61�9.13,
respectively; P=0.07). There was no evidence of time-matched
intragroup differences with QT interval, PR interval, and QRS
duration (all P>0.14).
Blood Pressure Effects
A significant difference in baseline-adjusted pSBP (Figure 3)
was evident 6 hours after energy drink consumption when
compared with the caffeine arm (4.72�4.67 mm Hg versus
0.83�6.09 mm Hg,
respectively;
P=0.01).
A
significant
decrease in baseline-adjusted AI was evident 6 hours post
energy
drink
when
compared
with
the
caffeine
arm
(�3.72�7.61 versus 1.50�9.85; P=0.02). No evidence of
difference was seen with pDBP, cSBP, or cDBP at any time
point between the 2 groups (all P>0.07).
Adverse Events
Adverse effects were experienced by 15 participants during
the energy drink arm and by 13 participants during the
caffeine control arm (Table 2). Adverse events included
anxiety, difficulty in falling asleep, dizziness, dyspepsia/upset
stomach, epistaxis, headache, jitteriness, nausea, palpita-
tions, and shortness of breath. These effects were reported
throughout the 24-hour monitoring period without a discern-
able pattern. None of the adverse events caused a discon-
tinuation in study participation.
Discussion
QTc prolongation is a recognized marker of increased risk for
fatal arrhythmias. Prolongation of the QT/QTc interval by
more than 60 ms from baseline or a value >500 ms is a
marker for life-threatening arrhythmias. For this reason,
several published studies have assessed QT/QTc effects post
energy drink consumption. This is one of the first caffeine-
controlled studies that shows significant QTc prolongation of
�10 ms 2 hours after high-volume energy drink consumption
in young healthy volunteers. It is possible that previous
published studies showed a lack of effect due to studying a
lower dose of energy drink (250–750 mL), monitoring for an
insufficient amount of time (30–240 minutes), or not having a
control arm.14–19 It also appears that the product and dose
used in our study was different from the other studies, which
might explain our significant findings. Our findings are similar
to another study (n=27), which used the same dose as ours
and found a significant 6-ms prolongation in QTc at 2 hours
when compared with placebo.20 Further, in a noncontrolled
study (n=14) using the same dose (2 cans) as in our study,
57% of participants had a QTc >500 ms post consumption.21
In contrast, a study by Brothers et al22 (n=15), comparing
low- and moderate-dose energy drinks, coffee, and water,
found no changes in the QTc interval.
The Food and Drug Administration requires a thorough
investigation of QT/QTc effects for all new drug entities, with
a prolongation over 10 ms prompting regulatory concern.23
Cisapride and other noncardiovascular drugs have been
withdrawn from the market because of a 5- to 10-ms QT
interval prolongation.24 Ephedra-containing dietary supple-
ments were also pulled from the market partly because of
their association with significant QTc interval prolongation.25

 Our findings are concerning since caffeine likely does not
affect the QTc interval based on previous studies. Further
investigation of other energy drink constituents is necessary.9
Taurine, L-carnitine, and panax ginseng are some additives
found in energy drinks and have conflicting physiologic
effects. The preponderance of evidence suggests taurine is
more likely an antiarrhythmic than a proarrhythmic.26 A
correlation between
L-carnitine deficiency and short QT
syndrome has been postulated.27 However, L-carnitine sup-
plementation is not suspected to result in an overcorrection
or prolongation of the QT interval based on published
literature. Interestingly, panax ginseng, at a dose of 200 mg
in one study, showed a transient prolongation of the QTc
interval 2 hours after ingestion, but this appears to be a
chance finding and not evident in other studies.20,28 Due to
the fact that multiple ingredients in energy drinks have the
ability to alter electrophysiological properties, their sole and
concurrent use needs further scrutiny.
The long-term use of energy drinks also needs particular
attention. In one study, consuming a single energy shot

Impact of Energy Drinks on ECG and BP

ORIGINAL RESEARCH

 In this study, both the energy drink and caffeine arms
exhibited a similar increase in pSBP from baseline for the
initial 4 hours post study drink consumption. Caffeine is
rapidly absorbed and typically peaks at about 1 hour,
explaining the initial BP increase in both study arms.32 This
is similar to results from another study by Svatikova et al33
that also suggested activation of the catecholamine pathway.
However, the sustained pSBP elevation by �4 mm Hg at
6 hours post energy drink consumption suggests that other
ingredients may be hemodynamically active. Guarana, another
common ingredient in energy drinks, may contain 2% to 15%
of its dry weight in caffeine.34 This may or may not explain a
delayed BP response when compared with caffeine alone.35
Taurine, in contrast, is thought to have a BP-lowering effect at
higher doses, potentially altering the overall BP response.36
The current literature is lacking regarding the hemodynamic
profile of the ingredients contained in energy drinks, making it
difficult to ascertain whether it is caffeine interacting with the
other ingredients or the other ingredients alone that are
driving the BP effects.
Although not statistically significant, a trend in the
elevation of cSBP at 6 hours post energy drink consumption
was evident. Central BP indices are emerging as superior
predictors of cardiovascular risk over peripheral BPs as they
better reflect vascular compliance and should be further
investigated in future studies.37 The trend towards a higher
HR at 2 hours and the lower AI at 6 hours in the energy drink
arm are clinically not critical in this acute setting.
Certain populations may consider exercising caution when
consuming energy drinks. Those with congenital long QT
syndrome are at a predisposed risk for arrhythmias, partic-
ularly torsades de pointes.38 More commonly, those with
acquired long QT syndrome induced by concomitant use of
QT/QTc-prolonging drugs, hypokalemia, or hypomagnesaemia
are at a similar risk.39 Obesity has also been associated with
prolongation of the QT interval.40,41 Interestingly, in one
noncontrolled study, the cohort with overweight/obese
participants (n=18) showed significant QT prolongation from
baseline after consuming 5 mL/kg of an energy drink
(340�57 ms versus 357�54 ms, P=0.006).24 The consump-
tion of energy drinks with alcohol is another practice common
in some social settings.42 Caution should be exercised as
combining alcohol or illicit substances with energy drinks may
trigger or exacerbate untoward cardiovascular events.43,44
Study Limitations
Our results should be interpreted with caution due to several
limitations. Importantly, our results only appear to be
significant relative to the caffeine group, and the change
from baseline post energy drinks is not alarming. Of note, the
risk of arrhythmia may be negligible because the QTc
difference is transient. Currently, we cannot explain the
QTc reduction in the caffeine arm. We did not utilize a true
placebo arm in this study, which may be critical for future
studies. As such, in another study using a noncaffeinated
placebo, a mild reduction in QTc was also evident.20 The
hemodynamic changes may be benign if not sustained with
chronic use. While caffeine alone is not expected to shorten
the QTc interval, this possibility cannot be ruled out. We did
not control for food intake post baseline measurement on
study days. Food intake has been linked to shortening of the
QTc interval, which could possibly explain our discordant
findings.45 We also used the machine-calculated values and
did not hand measure the ECG parameters. The latter is
considered as the gold standard by some experts. Our results
can only be generalized to the time points specified in the
study. Consumption of 946 mL (32 ounces) of an energy
drink over 45 minutes may not be representative of normal
consumption patterns. However, it is important to note that
710-mL (24 ounces) energy drink cans are readily available in
the market and it appears that serious adverse events may
be associated with a higher volume of consumption.46 T-wave
peak to T-wave end interval analysis is emerging as a superior
marker of arrhythmic risk and future studies should evaluate
not only the QT/QTc interval, but also the transmural
dispersion of ventricular repolarization to accurately depict
energy drink–related arrhythmic risk.47 Although our sample
size mimics some previous published studies, future studies
may need to employ a larger sample size to capture
differences in sex or dosing.25 Since this was a proof-of-
concept study, we were not powered for multiple compar-
isons and, as a result, the reported P values are not adjusted
for multiple comparisons.

Impact of Energy Drinks on ECG and BP

 Conclusions
Our study findings suggest significant prolongation of the QTc
interval 2 hours after energy drink consumption when com-
pared with caffeine. Systolic BP remained significantly ele-
vated over the caffeine control at 6 hours post energy drink
consumption. Ingredients contained in energy drinks other
than caffeine warrant further investigation. Larger clinical trials
controlling for the limitations of this study are warranted.
