Abstract
The population of patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) is continuously increasing with more and more
patients reaching adulthood. A significant portion of these young adults will suffer from arrhythmias due to the un-
derlying congenital heart defect itself or as a sequela of interventional or surgical treatment. The medical commu-
nity will encounter an increasing challenge as even most of the individuals with complex congenital heart defects
nowadays become young adults. Within the past 20 years, management of patients with arrhythmias has gained re-
markable progress including pharmacological treatment, catheter ablation, and device therapy. Catheter ablation in
patients with CHD has paralleled the advances of this technology in pediatric and adult patients with structurally
normal hearts. Growing experience and introduction of new techniques like the 3D mapping systems into clinical
practice have been particularly beneficial for this growing population of patients with abnormal cardiac anatomy
and physiology. Finally, device therapies allowing maintanence of chronotropic competence and AV conduction, im-
proving haemodynamics by cardiac resynchronization, and preventing sudden death are increasingly used. For phar-
macological therapy, ablation procedures, and device therapy decision making requires a deep understanding of the
individual pathological anatomy and physiology as well as detailed knowledge on natural history and long-term
prognosis of our patients. Composing expert opinions from cardiology and paediatric cardiology as well as from
non-invasive and invasive electrophysiology this position paper was designed to state the art in management of
young individuals with congenital heart defects and arrhythmias.

Introduction
The purpose of the present consensus statement was to summarize
knowledge and provide recommendations on diagnosis and treat-
ment of arrhythmias in patients with congenital heart defects (CHD),
because, in many cases, the anatomy and management of arrhythmias
in adult patients cannot directly be applied to patients with CHD.1–4
This position paper mainly addresses arrhythmias in adult CHD.
A consensus paper on paediatric CHD has been published in 2013.4
Evidence review
Members of the Task Force were asked to perform a detailed litera-
ture review, weigh the strength of evidence for or against a particular
treatment or procedure, and include estimates of expected health
outcomes where data exist. Patient-specific modifiers, comorbidities,
and issues of patient preference that might influence the choice of
particular tests or therapies were considered, as are frequency of
follow-up and cost effectiveness. In controversial areas, or with re-
gard to issues without evidence other than usual clinical practice, a
consensus was achieved by agreement of the expert panel after
discussions.
This document was prepared by the Task Force with representa-
tion from European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA), Association
for European Paediatric
and
Congenital
Cardiology
(AEPC),
European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Working Group on Grown-
up Congenital Heart Disease, Heart Rhythm Society (HRS), Pediatric
and Congenital Electrophysiology Society (PACES), Asia-Pacific
Heart Rhythm Society (APHRS), and Sociedad Latinoamericana de
Estimulacio
´n Cardı
´aca y Electrofisiologı
´a (SOLAECE).
The document was peer-reviewed by official external reviewers
representing EHRA, ESC WG on Grown up Congenital Heart
Disease, AEPC, PACES, HRS, APHRS, and SOLAECE.
Consensus statements are evidence based, and derived primarily
from published data. However, some statements in a consensus doc-
ument are ‘experienced based’ and relate to a low level of evidence
(LE). Furthermore, as in our article, evidence based data from ‘the
regular adult population’ are frequently extrapolated to ‘CHD
patients’. In contrast to guidelines, we have opted for an easier and

 user-friendly system of ranking using ‘coloured hearts’ that should al-
low physicians to easily assess current status of evidence and conse-
quent guidance (Table 1).
Thus, a ‘green heart’ indicates a recommended statement or rec-
ommended/indicated treatment (or procedure) and is based on at
least one randomized trial, or is supported by large observational evi-
dence that it is beneficial and effective. A ‘yellow heart’ indicates gen-
eral agreement and/or scientific evidence favouring a statement or
the usefulness/efficacy of a treatment or procedure. A yellow heart
may be supported by randomized trials based on small number of
patients or not widely applicable. Treatment strategies for which
there have been scientific evidence that they are potentially harmful
and should not be used are indicated by a ‘red heart’.
European Heart Rhythm Association grading of consensus state-
ments does not have separate definitions of LE. The categorization
used for consensus statements (used in consensus documents)
should not be considered as being directly similar to that used for of-
ficial society guideline recommendations which apply a classification
(I–III) and LE (A, B, and C) to recommendations in official guidelines.
Finally, this is a consensus document that includes evidence and ex-
pert opinions from several countries. The pharmacologic and non-
pharmacologic antiarrhythmic approaches discussed may, therefore,
include drugs or devices that do not have the approval of govern-
mental regulatory agencies in all countries.
Relationships with industry and other
conflicts of interest
It is EHRA/ESC policy to sponsor position papers and guidelines
without commercial support and all members volunteered their
time. Thus, all members of the writing group as well as reviewers
have disclosed any potential conflict of interest in detail at the end of
this document.
Scope of the consensus document
Patients with congenital heart disease constitute a heterogeneous
population with unique needs, concerns, and challenges. Current sur-
vival rates of congenital heart disease patients have improved, allow-
ing for an ever-growing population of adult survivors.
Arrhythmias figure foremost among the issues encountered in
this population and are the leading cause of morbidity and mortal-
ity. Several forms of CHD predispose to arrhythmias even without
any surgical intervention due to abnormalities of the conduction
system, intrinsic structural pathology, and impact of pre- or post-
operative cyanosis and volume-/pressure-overload. In general,
surgery for congenital heart defects may result in sinus node dys-
function, atrioventricular (AV) block and a variety of supraventric-
ular and ventricular tachyarrhythmias including the risk of sudden
cardiac death (SCD). Arrhythmia treatment in patients with CHD
requires high expertise of non-invasive and invasive electrophysi-
ology (EP) combined with a thorough knowledge and understand-
ing of the particular congenital heart defect encountered including
anatomy, pathophysiology, and surgical and/or interventional
treatment.
Arrhythmias in congenital heart
disease: general considerations
Arrhythmia substrates in congenital
heart disease
In general, arrhythmias in patients with CHD may be due to abnormal
anatomy or congenitally displaced or malformed sinus nodes or AV

Congenital substrates for arrhythmias in congenital heart
defects
Sinus node
Abnormal position of the sinus node may be found not only in rare
forms of malformed hearts with juxtaposition of the left atrial appen-
dages but may also be present in patients with sinus venosus defects
of superior vena cava (SVC) type. In hearts with left atrial isomerism,
sinus node tissue may be completely absent or may be found as rem-
nants in the inferior atrial wall near the AV junction, whereas in right
isomerism two sinus nodes may be present.4 An abnormal dysfunc-
tional sinus node can be found in usual position in patients with ab-
sence of the right superior caval vein.5
Atrioventricular block
Atrioventricular block in patients with congenitally malformed hearts
is most often observed in patients with congenitally corrected trans-
position of the great arteries (CC-TGA) and in individuals with iso-
meric arrangement of the atrial appendages, i.e. left isomerism, due
to displacement of the specialized conduction system with abnormal

 development of the central fibrous body.6 The life-long risk of com-
plete AV block in patients with CC-TGA is approximately 2% per
year and may reach 50% at 50 years of age.7
Twin atrioventricular nodes
Two distinct AV nodes (‘twin AV nodes’, Mo
¨nckeberg sling) may be
present in congenital heart defects with AV discordance ([S, L, L] or
[I, D, D]) with a malaligned complete AV canal defect and in right and
left atrial isomerism giving rise to paroxysmal supraventricular tachy-
cardia (SVT).8
Accessory atrioventricular connections
Accessory AV connections may be present in a variety of patients
with CHD with Ebstein’s anomaly of the tricuspid valve being the en-
tity with the highest prevalence. Multiple accessory pathways are of-
ten found including special variants with solely anterograde
decremental conduction as Mahaim type pathways. Additional types
of congenital heart defects with increased prevalence of accessory
pathways include heterotaxy syndromes, CC-TGA, AV septal
defects, and univentricular hearts.4
Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia
Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) may develop
in patients with various types of congenital heart defects at any age.
Depending on individual anatomy, localization of the specialized con-
duction system may be less predictable, particularly in patients with
single ventricle (Single V) physiology.9
Post-operative substrates for arrhythmias in congenital
heart defects
Sinus node dysfunction and atrioventricular block
Direct injury to the sinus node may occur by surgical incisions or su-
turing in the high right atrium. Atrial switch procedures for patients
with d-transposition of the great arteries, Fontan procedures for
patients with Single V physiology and rerouting of partial anomalous
pulmonary venous return are the most frequent surgical interven-
tions resulting in chronotropic incompetence. More than 50% of sur-
vivors from the Mustard operation, for instance, have lost reliable
sinus rhythm by adulthood.10 Sinus node dysfunction is often associ-
ated with limited exercise capacity and aggravation of AV valve regur-
gitation
which
in
turn
may
contribute
to
development
of
macroreentrant atrial tachycardia (MRAT).4,10 The conduction sys-
tem is particularly susceptible to injury during surgical and catheter
procedures in patients with ASDs and CC-TGA.10 In addition, peri-
membranous ventricular septal defect is associated with increased
risk for AV block related to percutaneous closure at younger age.
Macroreentrant atrial tachycardias
Macroreentrant atrial tachycardia include incisional intraatrial tachycar-
dias and atrial flutter (AF). Atrial tachycardias (AT) are frequently en-
countered after surgical repair of a wide variety of congenital heart
defects. Incisional atrial arrhythmias may occur even 10 to 15years post-
surgery. Anatomical substrates of reentrant ATs are areas with pre-
existing intraatrial conduction abnormalities as well as suture lines, scar
tissue, and/or prosthetic material. A stable reentrant circuit may occur

 around these structures of electrical isolation and anatomic obstacles,
such as the orifices of the great veins and the AV annuli, often utilizing a
protected zone of atrial tissue with or without slow conduction. Over
60% of these atrial reentrant circuits involve the cavo-tricuspid isthmus
(CTI). Scar-related reentrant AT and AF are the most common types of
SVT in adult CHD patients. Typical congenital heart defects include atrial
septal defects (ASD), tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), Ebstein anomaly of the
tricuspid valve, Single V physiology after Fontan procedure, and d-trans-
position of the great arteries after atrial switch operation1,11 (Figure 2).
Focal atrial tachycardia
This arrhythmia mechanism which is predominantly seen in patients
post-total cavopulmonary Fontan connection and after atrial switch
procedures for D-TGA is highly variable, encompassing simple, and
more complex substrates, such as enhanced automaticity or micro-
reentry with a focal origin [non-automatic focal AT (NAFAT)].12
Discrete areas of heterogenous conduction can be detected as the
source of these tachycardias.13,14
Accessory pathways after Bjo
¨rk-Fontan modification
Occasionally, accessory AV pathways may be created by means of
surgical intervention in patients with tricuspid atresia, connecting the
right atrial appendage to the right ventricular outflow tract (Fontan-
Bjo
¨rk procedure).15
Ventricular arrhythmias
Stable monomorphic ventricular tachycardia
Stable monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) in patients with
CHD is based upon morphological/anatomical variants of the heart
defect itself or to ventricular incisions and prosthetic material like
tubes and patches that allow initiation and perpetuation of a ventricu-
lar macroreentrant circuit. These tachycardias often depend on criti-
cal isthmuses within the right ventricular outflow tract bordered by
patches or scar after ventriculotomy incisions. A unique example is
unoperated/native and post-operative TOF and its variants.16–18
Stable monomorphic VT can be fatal and a cause of SCD dependent
on cardiac function and VT cycle length as in post-operative TOF
patients even with preserved cardiac function. Incidence of sustained
VT/ventricular fibrillation (VF) has been reported at 14.6% in 556
adult patients after TOF repair.19
Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia
Fast polymorphic VT and VF with the risk of SCD may develop in
patients with severely diseased ventricular myocardium, significant fi-
brosis, and myocardial disarray. Typical congenital heart defects in-

Work-up of patients with congenital
heart disease and arrhythmias
Early diagnosis and electrocardiogram (ECG) documentation of the
underlying arrhythmia is of paramount importance for long-term
treatment success, as some arrhythmias have a propensity to degen-
erate into more difficult to treat arrhythmias [e.g. AT into atrial fibril-
lation (AF)]. The first step is consultation to a paediatric or congenital

 cardiologist to exclude haemodynamic or anatomical triggers and to
initiate pharmacological treatment where applicable. Timely referral
to a centre with a multidisciplinary team and expertise in CHD
patients and CHD-related arrhythmia is mandatory.
Acute assessment of the congenital heart disease patient
presenting with arrhythmia
The key task for the physician taking care of the CHD patient pre-
senting with an arrhythmia is to assess the clinical impact of the ar-
rhythmia and to decide if immediate treatment (e.g. direct current
cardioversion) is necessary. Some CHD patients may present in
AT with haemodynamic compromise due to a combination of
rapid AV conduction and impaired ventricular function/haemody-
namics. Particularly, patients with baffle obstruction after atrial
switch procedure may develop significant decrease of ventricular
preload in AF with rapid ventricular response, and individuals with
residual left or right ventricular outflow tract obstruction and
rapid ventricular rhythm are prone to haemodynamic collapse
due to low cardiac output requiring immediate appropriate
treatment.
Besides recurrent need for direct current cardioversion, ineffective
pharmacological treatment and/or intolerance for drugs (e.g. electro-
pysiological side effects or systemic side effects) should prompt refer-
ral of the patient to a dedicated ablation centre experienced in the
management of patients with CHD. While re-entrant AT in patients
with a biventricular heart may be successfully treated by experienced
electrophysiological centres non-dedicated for CHD, the same ar-
rhythmia is very likely not to be handled appropriately at that institu-
tion in complex CHD patients.1,4
Collaboration between specialists in adult congenital
heart disease and arrhythmia specialists
In order to obtain the best outcome for a complex CHD patient
with arrhythmia, multidisciplinary team discussions are recom-
mended to consider all options available. Collaboration should in-
clude
discussion
about
pharmacological
management
and
optimized haemodynamic management. In addition, the congenital
cardiac surgeon plays an important role when surgery combining
haemodynamic optimization and surgical ablation/device implan-
tation is planned. In some instances, a surgical or a hybrid proce-
dure may be considered, as in patients lacking vascular access to a
given target heart chamber like in a patient with both mitral and
aortic mechanical valves and LV-VT. Similarly, if access is not easily
achieved or if local expertise is not sufficient, early referral of the
patient to a dedicated CHD arrhythmia centre is warranted with
the ability of special procedures and technologies like remote
magnetic navigation, transapical or transventricular access, and
baffle puncture. In particular instances, an experienced electro-
physiologist and an experienced interventional congenital cardiol-
ogist may be required to support a local hospital team if transfer
of the patient is not feasible.
General assessment of the congenital heart disease
patient with arrhythmias
When assessing a CHD patient with an arrhythmia, a comprehen-
sive assessment of the individual haemodynamics is required.
Standard diagnostic procedures include detailed history, complete
physical examination, 12-lead ECG, and a transthoracic or trans-
oesophageal echocardiogram in order to establish the function of
both the systemic and subpulmonary ventricle and to identify re-
sidual significant haemodynamic abnormalities like a paravalvular
leak, valvar stenosis, or significant AV or semilunar valve regurgita-
tion (Table 2). Echocardiography is often not completely sufficient
to delineate individual anatomy and particular lesions like systemic
venous baffle obstruction in Mustard and Senning patients. Left
and right heart catheterization is frequently required accordingly.
In patients with univentricular hearts, cardiac magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) is indicated for reliable assessment of ventricular
function. This also applies for TOF patients for evaluation of right
ventricular function. Finally, intracardiac thrombus formation
needs to be excluded before cardioversion or any intracardiac in-
tervention. Optimization of individual haemodynamics should be
sought before/after an intervention.

 In any post-operative CHD patient, a careful review of surgical
note(s) may offer significant insight into post-operative anatomy and
potential arrhythmia substrates like suture lines and atriotomy scars.
When planning an ablation procedure or implantation of a cardiac
device, patency of vessels allowing access to the heart needs to be
established. Especially in patients with multiple previous interven-
tions, vascular access may propose a major hurdle to any invasive ar-
rhythmia management. Appropriate imaging should be performed by
echocardiography, angiography, or MRI/computed tomography (CT)
scans.
Laboratory studies should focus on any inflammatory process, hy-
perthyroidism, anaemia, plasmatic coagulation, and kidney and liver
function.
Arrhythmia management via implanted devices
If an implanted device is present, device memory should be interro-
gated to obtain detailed information about arrhythmia onset, mecha-
nism, and duration. Depending on available leads, overdrive options
may be considered for atrial arrhythmia. Occasionally, leads (mostly
epicardial) may have broken and can not be used for device mediated
overdrive pacing anymore.
Imaging requirements for invasive procedures: road
mapping
If catheter ablation is planned, adequate imaging of individual anatomy
may serve as a roadmap and planning tool for the invasive procedure
especially in patients with complex CHD. Imaging should be per-
formed with the least amount of radiation and contrast agents.
Computed tomography scans may require extensive contrast expo-
sure as cardiac transit times may be prolonged exposing the patient
to increased radiation. Non-contrast MRI uses blood pool imaging.
However, artificial structures such as stents, valves, clips, devices and
(abandoned) leads, and sternal cerclages may create artefacts. Images
need to be critically reviewed to assure that 3D segmentation is feasi-
ble for a given target area. Online imaging should be considered with
transoesophageal (TOE) or intracardiac echocardiogram (ICE) allow-
ing delineation of individual anatomy and monitoring of the
procedure.
Specific arrhythmia types
Supraventricular arrhythmias in patients
with congenital heart disease
Almost 50% of all adult CHD patients will be confronted with the oc-
currence of SVT during their lifetime.21 Intra-atrial re-entrant tachy-
cardias and AF are the most frequent types of SVT in these patients,
but AV re-entrant tachycardia (AVRT) using an accessory pathway
and AVNRT are also encountered.22 Factors such as underlying anat-
omy, age, and surgical repair technique have an impact on prevalence
and arrhythmia substrate.
Accessory pathways and atrioventricular reentrant
tachycardias
Ebstein’s anomaly is the entity most frequently associated with AV re-
ciprocating tachycardia due to the presence of often multiple and
mainly right-sided accessory pathways including pathways of Mahaim
type.23 Up to 20% of Ebstein patients harbour one or more accessory
pathways.24 This unique situation is the consequence of caudal dis-
placement of the septal tricuspid valve leaflet, which is associated
with disruption of the central fibrous body and septal AV ring with di-
rect muscular connections.25 These muscular connections form the
substrate for accessory AV connections. The presence of multiple ac-
cessory pathways may result in a combination of orthodromic and
antidromic AVRT. These types of arrhythmias are also known to oc-
cur in CC-TGA associated with Ebstein’s malformation of the sys-
temic (tricuspid) AV valve.
Atrioventricular nodal re-entrant tachycardia
Atrioventricular nodal re-entrant tachycardia occurs less frequently
in CHD patients.9,26–29 Symptoms may include palpitations and syn-
cope. Displacement of the specialized conduction system in patients
with CHD implies an increased risk of AV block during ablation pro-
cedures. Special attention is required in patients with AV septal
defects, CC-TGA, heterotaxy syndromes, or dextrocardia (Figure 3).
Atrial tachycardias
Atrial tachycardias are common in CHD patients. Incidence is related
to complexity of the congenital heart defect, type of surgical proce-
dure, patient age, and interval post-surgery.25,30 In a series of 38 430
CHD patients, CHD types with the highest prevalence of atrial
tachyarrhythmias were Ebstein’s anomaly (33%), D-TGA after atrial
switch procedure (28%), and ASD (19%).22
In patients with simple, unoperated cardiac defects, such as ASD
who may remain undiagnosed until late in adult life, atrial tachyar-
rhythmias are related to the volume load imposed on the right atrium
by long-standing left-to-right shunting. Atrial flutter has clearly been
associated with significant tricuspid regurgitation in CHD.30,31 In
the majority of patients with CHD, however, ATs result from a
combination of haemodynamic factors and surgical scars or pros-
thetic material used for intracardiac repair30,32 (Figure 4). Atrial
tachyarrhythmias, with AF becoming more common, expose these
patients also to the inherent risks of thrombus formation and stroke.
Prognosis in patients with ATs and complex CHD is often less be-
nign than in patients without CHD or simple CHD substrates (e.g.
MRAT in D-TGA and post-Fontan vs. typical AF in ASD). History of
AF has been identified as a risk factor of SCD in complex CHD
patients.21,33 Since most of these subjects, especially young adults,
have normal AV nodal function, rapid atrial rates may be transmitted
1:1 from atria to ventricles which may lead to syncope and SCD, par-
ticularly when ventricular function is poor, as it is commonly present
in patients with a Syst RV.34
An ASD is often present in patients with CHD and may contribute
to development of atrial tachyarrhythmias.30 In older patients with
unoperated ASD, a history of AF was present in 19% and AF in
61%.35 Electrophysiological studies in ASD patients without previous
episodes of atrial tachyarrhythmias have shown electrical remodelling
of the atria with an increase of atrial effective refractory periods and
conduction delay at the crista terminalis.36 In a large meta-analysis of
26 studies including 1841 patients undergoing surgical closure and
945 undergoing percutaneous closure, prevalence of atrial tachyar-
rhythmias decreased by one-third after closure of the defect.37

 Age plays a major role: older age at the time of closure was one of
the main risk factors for post-closure atrial arrhythmias, accompanied
by the presence of pre-operative AF or flutter.38 The long-term out-
come after ASD closure at young age is excellent.39
The Fontan circulation in patients with a univentricular heart is
prone to atrial tachyarrhythmias both located at the lateral right atrial
wall40 and at the CTI. Prevalence of MRAT was higher in the first
2 years after Fontan and increased again gradually in later childhood.40
The atriopulmonary connection is often associated with a progressive
and massive enlargement of the systemic venous atrium. In a contem-
porary multicentre series, 19% of these patients developed MRAT,
with older series showing even higher rates41 The newer Fontan modi-
fications including intracardiac lateral tunnel, extracardiac lateral tunnel,
or extracardiac conduit were significantly less arrhythmogenic,

 showing MRAT in a range from 2 to 7%.41 Another series also demon-
strated that a lateral tunnel type Fontan was associated with a signifi-
cant decrease in arrhythmias as compared to an atriopulmonary
Fontan with a 39% vs. 13% 15 years of incidence of SVT.41 Improved
results may be explained by less atrial surgery and improved haemody-
namics of the modern Fontan modifications.
Patients after atrial switch procedures (Mustard/Senning) are also
highly prone to develop MRAT. Prevalence may reach up to 27% at
20years
post-surgery,
often
revolving
around
the
tricuspid
annulus.42,43 The arterial switch procedure was less proarrhythmo-
genic with an AF rate of 5% in adulthood.44
It has been hypothesized that development of MRAT may be pre-
vented at cardiac surgery by extending atriotomy incisions to ana-
tomical obstacles of electrical isolation, avoiding development of new
reentry circuits.
Finally, it should be emphasized that surface ECG in complex
CHD patients may be difficult to interpret with regard to ATs as low
amplitude atrial signals are often present. These arrhythmias may
therefore be missed at normal ventricular rates and only slightly ir-
regular rhythm.
Atrial fibrillation
Atrial fibrillation has been reported with increasing prevalence in
patients with congenital heart defects. It is of note that AF occurs at a
younger age in CHD patients than in the general population. A pre-
existing organized AT or frequent atrial ectopy may be present in al-
most two-thirds of these patients.45,46 Atrial fibrillation in CHD
patients considerably increases the risk of stroke and heart failure. In
addition to the known risk factors for AF in the general population as
age, arterial hypertension, New York Heart Association (NYHA)
functional class, obesity and diabetes, adults with CHD carry the ad-
ditional factors of the underlying heart defect as myocardial scarring
and fibrosis, patches/scars from heart surgery, and potential chronic
oxygen desaturation.46
Atrial fibrillation is predominantly seen in adult CHD patients with
left heart obstructive lesions, chronic left atrial dilatation, pre-existing
pulmonary hypertension, Fontan procedures, TOF, and after late
ASD closure.35,40,41 It is of note, that a significant number of patients
with congenital heart defects may develop AF later in life after suc-
cessful ablation of reentrant AT. As more patients with CHD survive
to older ages, AF will attain considerable attention in the future.47
Chronic oral anticoagulation should be considered in adult con-
genital heart patients with history of AF/AF after intracardiac repair,
with cyanosis, after Fontan palliation and in individuals with a Syst RV,
apart
from
those
evaluated
with
the
CHA2DSc
score.
Antiarrhythmic therapy with Class IC antiarrhythmic agents and
amiodarone is effective in almost 50% of the patients, but systemic
side effects and proarrhythmia are of concern and require careful
surveillance.1,48 Direct current cardioversion with appropriate anti-
coagulation is safe and effective for patients with CHD, even in the
presence of an intracardiac shunt and spontaneous contrast on
TOE.49 Haemodynamically, rhythm control may be superior to rate
control for AF in congenital heart patients, but up to now, there are
no data available supporting this hypothesis. Pulmonary vein isolating
catheter ablation procedures for drug-refractory AF may be benefi-
cial in selected patients, but experience is limited.50–52 The same
applies to surgical Maze procedures.53 Prophylactic arrhythmia sur-
gery has been advocated to be incorporated into reparative open
heart procedures for CHD patients, but data on efficacy are lacking.54
In symptomatic patients with AF refractory to pharmacologic and ab-
lation therapy or failure to adequately control the average heart rate,
AV nodal ablation and post-ablation pacing may be considered as
third-line therapy.30,55
Ventricular arrhythmias and sudden
cardiac death in patients with congenital
heart disease
Ventricular tachycardia
Ventricular ectopy and non-sustained VTs (VTs < 30s; NSVT) are
relatively common in adults with CHD. The relationship between
NSVT and sustained VT or sudden death is still a matter of debate in
these patients. In TOF, NSVT may be associated with SCD although

 there is conflicting data.19,56,57 In CHD patients with implantable car-
dioverter-defibrillator (ICD) for primary prevention, the same associ-
ation was found for symptomatic NSVT in a multivariable analysis,58
but results from other studies are equivocal.59,60
Sustained ventricular arrhythmias in adults with congenital heart
disease (ACHD) encompass monomorphic VT, polymorphic VT, and
VF.57,61–63 Based on distribution of CHD across ICD studies and on
population based series on presumed arrhythmic death in CHD, sus-
tained ventricular arrhythmias are more likely to occur in patients
with TOF, complex forms of d-TGA, Syst RVs and left ventricular
outflow tract obstructive lesions.59,63–65
In a multicentre cross-sectional study of 556 patients with TOF,
NSVT was the single most common arrhythmia subtype with a preva-
lence of 14.2%, which markedly increased after the age of 45 years. In
contrast, VF was documented in only 0.5% of the population.19
Additional data on the prevalence of any ventricular arrhythmias
come were derived from ICD interrogation studies.63 There were re-
markable differences in the type of documented ventricular arrhyth-
mias. Monomorphic VTs constituted 81.5% of all ventricular
arrhythmias in TOF.57 In contrast, only 48.9% of all ventricular
arrhythmias in D-TGA were monomorphic VT, the remaining being
polymorphic VT in 34%, and VF in 17%.61 Monomorphic VT in TOF
were typically rapid with median heart rates of 213 bpm.56,66–69
Monomorphic VT due to a specific substrate can be targeted by
catheter or surgical interventions, independent of tachycardia cycle
length, and need to be distinguished from polynorphic VT/VF associ-
ated with advanced ventricular dysfunction with or without surgical
scars.66,67,69,70
Sudden cardiac death
Due to the low prevalence of CHD, patients with such diseases rep-
resent a minority in the overall group of patients suffering SCD.71
Sudden cardiac death, however, represents one of the three main
causes of death in patients with CHD with the other two being pro-
gressive heart failure and perioperative mortality.72,73 Consistent
data in large populations of patients with CHD have shown a per-
centage of SCD among deaths in this population of approximately
20–25%.59,74 The risk of SCD increases with complexity of the dis-
ease.59,74 Nevertheless, it has to be kept in mind that even patients
with mild disease still have a non-negligible risk of SCD. Finally, as
arrhythmias remain the main contributing cause of death in patients
with cyanotic lesions, SCD in patients with non-cyanotic disease and
simple lesions is probably related to coronary artery disease.75
Sudden cardiac death associated with bradycardias and
atrial arrhythmias
The risk of SCD from sinus or junctional bradycardia leading to sinus
arrest is controversial.72,73,76,77 The bradycardia–tachycardia syn-
drome is considered to predispose for SCD.19,78–80 SCD due to AV
block represents probably less than 5% of all SCD in adult CHD
patients.19,73,78–80 Prolonged asystole or bradycardia triggered VT
are potential causes of SCD in untreated AV block.79 Treatment
must be focused on the underlying disease and includes catheter or
surgical ablation and/or antiarrhythmic therapy as well as pacemaker
implantation in bradycardia–tachycardia syndrome.30
Sudden cardiac death due to ventricular arrhythmias
Approximately 20–25% of deaths in adults with CHD are estimated
to be due to sudden cardiac events.59,65,70,81,82 However, identifying
patients at risk for SCD remains a challenge. With the exception of
TOF, specific guidelines regarding ICD implantation for primary pre-
vention in CHD remain elusive. Patients considered as high risk for
SCD include those with systemic ventricular ejection fraction
(EF)<
_35%, biventricular physiology, and NYHA Class II or III symp-
toms. Risk factors for SCD in TOF include left ventricular systolic and
diastolic dysfunction, QRS duration>
_180 ms, extensive right ventric-
ular scarring, NSVT, and inducible sustained VT during the electro-
physiological study.19,30,57
The value of programmed ventricular stimulation beyond TOF is
unknown. In a small group of d-transposition patients with intra-atrial
baffles, positive ventricular stimulation studies were not predictive
for future events.61 Decreased systemic right ventricular function in
patients with D-TGA after atrial switch operations has been identi-
fied as a risk factor of ventricular arrhythmias and SCD.80,83
Unfortunately, no data to date suggest a defined cut-off for right ven-
tricular dysfunction as quantified by EF. Implantation of an ICD may
be considered in patients with low right ventricular EF and additional
risk factors which include complex ventricular arrhythmias, unex-
plained syncope, NYHA Class II or III, QRS duration >140 ms, or se-
vere systemic AV valve regurgitation.33,61,80,83
The risk of inappropriate shocks in CHD patients with primary
prevention ICDs must be outweighed against the benefits.30,84 Rates
of inappropriate shocks were mostly the result of misinterpretation
of sinus tachycardia, supraventricular arrhythmias, T-wave oversens-
ing, and lead failure. Decreased lead longevity and performance must
also be taken into account in this patient population as rates of lead
failure are definetely higher compared to adults without CHD.85
Value of subcutaneous ICD (S-ICD) in CHD patients lacking need for
permanent pacing needs to be established.86
Bradyarrhythmias in patients with
congenital heart disease
Congenital atrioventricular block
Congenital complete heart block (CCHB), first described by
Morquio in 190187 and documented on ECG in 1908,88 is due to dis-
ruption of the electrophysiological continuity between atria and ven-
tricles.89–92 Congenital complete heart block may occur in a
structurally normal heart (isolated CCHB) or in association with a va-
riety of CHD. The frequent aetiologies of CCHB are listed in Table 3.
Symptoms are related to underlying anatomy and ventricular rate
and include heart failure prenatally and in infancy, and reduced exer-
cise tolerance, presyncope, or syncope (Stokes–Adams attacks) at
any age.93–97
Long-term conventional right ventricular apical pacing may result
in desynchronization of ventricular electrical activation leading to del-
eterious left ventricular remodelling, dilatation, and asymmetrical
hypertrophy.98–100 Regular assessment of cardiac function is there-
fore required. Therefore, upgrade to biventricular pacing in patients
with congenital heart block and high rate of right ventricular pacing
(RVP) should be considered.

 Post-surgical atrioventricular block
Post-surgical heart block was first explored in detail by Lillehei in
1963101 and still occurs in 1–3% cases of congenital heart surger-
ies102–105 especially after closure of ventricular septal defects, after
TOF repair, surgery along the left ventricular outflow tract, and left-
sided valve surgery.30 A recent multicentre study demonstrated high-
est incidences of AV block and pacemaker placement after the dou-
ble switch operation (15.6%), tricuspid valve (7.8%) and mitral valve
(7.4%) replacement, atrial switch with ventricular septal defect repair
(6.4%) and Rastelli operation (4.8%).106 Compared to surgery, a
higher rate (3–20%) of complete heart block (CHB) following trans-
catheter device closure of perimembranous ventricular septal defect
has been reported107–110 resulting in abandoning the procedure in
children<30 kg or age <6 years. Complete heart block usually occurs
immediately after surgery or early in the post-operative period and
has been reported only occasionally months or even years
thereafter.
Incidence of late-onset AV block has been reported with a rate of
0.3 to 0.7%.111–113 Late-onset AV block may be due to progressive fi-
brosis and sclerosis involving specialized conduction pathways which
are fragile in CHD.114
Early post-operative CHB can be transient or permanent. Most
patients
with
early
post-operative
AV
block
recover
spontaneously115–119 within the first 7 to 10 days.120 Therefore, at
least 7 days of observation before pacemaker implantation is strongly
recommended. During this period, temporary pacing wires may be
needed to maintain adequate chronotropy. Late recovery has also
been demonstrated by several investigators.121–124 First degree, sec-
ond degree AV block combined with complete right bundle
branch block have been observed after recovery from complete AV
block.105,125 Limited data suggest that residual bifascicular block after
early post-operative complete AV block is a significant risk factor for
late-onset complete heart block and SCD.112
One year of mortality of patients with complete post-surgical AV
block who did not receive permanent pacemaker implantation has
been reported ranging from 28 to 100% in several studies from
30 years ago101,117,126 underscoring undisputable need for permanent
pacemaker therapy.
Sinus node dysfunction
Sinus node dysfunction (SND) encompasses a broad array of distur-
bances in impulse generation of the sinus node and its propagation to
the surrounding atrial tissues. It may be a consequence of specific
congenital structural defects such as left atrial isomerism127,128 and
left-sided juxtaposition of the atrial appendages. In most patients,
SND is secondary to surgical procedures such as repair of sinus veno-
sus ASDs,129 Glenn shunts, Fontan operation,130–134 and Senning or
Mustard procedures.135–137 Post-operative SND may result from di-
rect damage to the sinus node or its blood supply.
Loss of AV synchrony may distinctly worsen AV valve regurgita-
tion, and a low resting heart rate with poor chronotropic response is
associated with reduced cardiac output. Sinus node dysfunction
results in atrial remodelling138 with increasing risks of atrial tachyar-
rhythmias, the tachycardia–bradycardia syndrome.139 Although there
has not been direct evidence of the relationship between SND and
sudden death in patients with congenital heart disease,76 uncon-
trolled atrial tachyarrhythmias may increase the risk of heart failure,
mortality, and SCD,73,140,141 particularly in those with ventricular dys-
function. In addition, thrombo-embolic events including stroke have
been reported, especially in patients with tachycardia–bradycardia
syndrome. Symptoms of SND vary depending on function of the car-
diac conduction system, particular underlying structural heart defect
and age. Fatigue, dizziness, exercise intolerance, and syncope have
been reported in children and adults.142 Twelve-lead ECG, ambula-
tory Holter, event monitors, and exercise stress tests should rou-
tinely be performed for assessment and diagnosis of SND.
Provocative
testing

Management of arrhythmias in
congenital heart disease
Pharmacological management
Arrhythmia mechanisms in adult congenital heart disease classically
are represented by atrial or ventricular macroreentrant circuits ro-
tating around sites of fixed and functional myocardial conduction
block, through areas of slowed conduction, and thereby facilitating
that the wave front captures excitable myocardium. Additional tachy-
cardia types include focal tachycardias, AVRT, AVNRT, and AF.
Pharmacological therapy should be guided by understanding of the in-
dividual cardiac pathology, the specific electroanatomic substrate and
electrophysiological features of the tachycardia (Tables 4–6).
Given the marked heterogeneity and the continued evolution of
adult congenital heart disease, no randomized controlled trial data is
available to guide pharmacological management. Reports encompass
largely retrospective experience with different agents prescribed
based on the specific clinical situation.

 Acute management
Adenosine is the treatment of choice for acute management of AV
nodal dependent mechanisms. Special consideration should be taken
into account when using adenosine in patients with low EF depending
on high heart rate in order to preserve cardiac output. Use of adeno-
sine is not advocated in this instance. In haemodynamically stable
patients intravenous beta-blockers (Class II) or calcium-channel
antagonists (Class IV) may afford rate control prior to spontaneous
conversion or alternative management.1 In a Dutch series of CHD
patients with first presentation of SVT, 14 patients underwent intra-
venous beta-blocker therapy with 100% success, and 34 patients had
oral therapy with 88% success.48 Additional agents included adeno-
sine, sotalol, amiodarone, flecainide, verapamil, metoprolol, and
procainamide.48 In 29 patients with AF or AVRT dofetilide (not avail-
able in Europe) successfully reestablished sinus rhythm in 12, but side
effects were significant (41%).150 Quinidine, disopyramide, and sota-
lol, have been associated with increased all-cause mortality.156 The
potential benefits of intravenous sotalol remain unknown at present.
Negative inotropes such as beta-blockers and verapamil can cause
cardiovascular collapse when ventricular function is compromised.
Prior echocardiography and a slow infusion rate rather than bolus in-
jection should be warranted. In patients with documented SND,

 back-up pacing should be available prior to attempted pharmacologi-
cal treatment.
In view of unpredictable side effects of negative inotropic agents in
CHD patients with paroxysmal SVT or AF, electrical cardioversion
(AF) or i.v. adenosine (SVT) should be the preferred forms of acute
therapy. Acute atrial overdrive pacing is very effective in terminating
AF and MRAT avoiding side effects of pharmacologic agents at all
(Table 4).
Long-term management
Long-term antiarrhythmic therapy is associated with poor long-term
arrhythmia freedom and a high rate of side effects in CHD patients.
At 2.5± 1.4 years follow-up only 45% of 70 patients treated for SVT
with varying anti-arrhythmic agents had freedom from recurrence.
Success was higher in those with heart failure symptoms at baseline
(hazard ratio 1.9; P = 0.023). Amiodarone is an effective agent for
complex CHD (with or without ventricular dysfunction) and for
moderate CHD with ventricular dysfunction, although patients fre-
quently develop side effects requiring discontinuation or dose reduc-
tion.48 Amiodarone as a long-term therapeutic regimen is therefore
not recommended in young CHD patients. Sotalol should not be
used related to increased risk for proarrhythmias and mortality.156
Dofetilide therapy either maintained sinus rhythm or improved ar-
rhythmia control in 49% of patients at a median follow-up of
3 years,150 but side effects were significant.
Given the poor efficacy of antiarrhythmic agents and prevalence of
CTI dependent AF in 75–80% of patients following biventricular re-
pair of CHD, a primary ablative strategy may be157 (Table 5).
Side effects of antiarrhythmic therapy in congenital heart
disease
Antiarrhythmic therapy is associated with a significant potential
for side effects in CHD population, specifically worsening of SND,
negative inotropy, AV block, and aggravation of repolarization abnor-
malities. These problems may be accentuated by altered pharmaco-
dynamics related to circulatory anomalies or hepatic and/or renal
dysfunction, necessitating careful dose adjustment. Efficacy of enteral
agents may be hampered by gastrointestinal congestion resulting in
poor absorption.
Major adverse events including ventricular arrhythmias and stroke
have been reported. Some antiarrhythmics such as IC drugs may
slow the rate of the atrial arrhythmia without blocking AV conduc-
tion and potentially allowing 1:1 conduction of an atrial arrhythmia
with worsening haemodynamics. Thyroid disease is a major issue un-
der amiodarone therapy with a reported prevalence of 33 in

 90 patients. Another 19 patients developed hyperthyroidism after a
median of 2.5years, and 14 developed hypothyroidism after a median
of 3.5years. In general, risk factors for amiodarone toxicity include fe-
male sex, adolescent age, cyanotic heart disease, and a Fontan
circulation.147
Anticoagulation
Thrombo-embolic cerebrovascular complications are a major cause
of morbidity in the CHD population, necessitating individualized risk
stratification and initiation of anticoagulant therapy. Age and sex stan-
dardized incidence rates of ischaemic stroke demonstrate an 9- to
12-fold risk for the CHD population below 55 years of age with heart
failure, diabetes mellitus, and recent myocardial infarction identified
as the strongest predictors.158 Specific anatomic groups have been
shown a particular high risk of thrombo-embolic complications, in-
cluding uncorrected cyanotic heart disease (23%), Eisenmeger physi-
ology (5%), native ASDs (4%), and the Fontan circulation (4%). In
25% of cases, stroke was associated with loss of sinus rhythm.159
Specific groups such as those with the Fontan circulation or those
with residual right-to-left intracardiac shunts (e.g. Eisenmenger syn-
drome) may benefit from anticoagulation. Although patients with
central cyanosis do have a higher risk for thrombo-embolism because
of low flow, remarkably they have also a higher bleeding risk as coag-
ulation is insufficient. In most centres, the current practice is to anti-
coagulate cyanotic patients when suffering from AF/flutter; however,
with accepting increased risk for life-threatening bleeding.
Anticoagulation should always be individualized in discussion with
the patient and based on the relative risks of stroke and haemor-
rhagic compliations. In lower risk patients strategies similar to those
used for other variants of structural heart disease, the CHA2DS2-
VASc risk-factor based approach appears appropriate.160 Stroke pre-
vention is recommended with the same indications as in AF amongst
CHD patients with typical AF or AT (Table 5). Low risk patients with
AF, defined as CHA2DS2-VASc 0 in males or 1 in females, typically do
not need antithrombotic therapy.161
Effective stroke prevention in patients with CHA2DS2-VASc
score >
_1 is oral anticoagulation, whether with well controlled vitamin
K antagonists (VKA) or with a non-VKA oral anticoagulant
(NOAC)—either dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban.162
Catheter ablation
Catheter ablation of congenital (inherited) tachycardia
substrates
Besides the fact that antiarrhythmic drugs are often associated with
negative inotropic and/or dromotropic effects in CHD, the main rea-
son for performing ablation as first-line therapy is its efficacy superior
to pharmacological therapy. Catheter ablation is increasingly used in
CHD patients to treat all types of tachycardias including AVRT,
AVNRT, and VT.29,47 However, while acute success rates of ablation
are high, recurrences are not uncommon, and approximately 50% of
CHD patients remain free of non-CTI dependent MRAT and VT in
the long term.163
Technical challenges and limitations
When planning an ablation procedure, alternative access routes to
the heart may be needed, such as internal jugular, subclavian, femoral
collateral, or transhepatic access.164 Expertise in EP ablation is also
mandatory if transseptal or transbaffle punctures are needed to ac-
cess the pulmonary venous atrium.165–168 This procedure should be
reserved for specialized, dedicated centres with surgical back-up as
an alternative to retrograde transaortic access165 (Table 7). Epicardial
ablation approach in post-operative CHD may be required in se-
lected patients, but data are sparse.
Anatomical challenges
The cornerstone of catheter ablation procedures in CHD patients
with congenital SVT substrate is the correct understanding of site
and course of the specific conduction system and individual cardiac
anatomy.8–10,19,21,23,27,28,43,136,164,175,178–199 In patients with physio-
logically aligned septal structures, such as in VSD and TOF, the trian-
gle of Koch serves as a good reference for location of the compact
AV node, whereas its position is highly variable when abnormal align-
ment of the septum is present8,19,21,23,27,28,136,179–184 Anatomic varia-
tions of the specific conduction tissue have a direct impact on the
rate of major procedural complications, particularly AV block.
Specific arrhythmias and malformations
In patients with Ebstein’s anomaly, episodes of paroxysmal SVT are
frequent, and are typically related to the presence of accessory
pathways.10,185–193 Catheter ablation of accessory AV connections is
the preferred therapeutic option with lower acute success rates189
and higher recurrence rates compared with patients with normal
hearts190,191 (Table 7). With further development of catheter and
sheath technology and by the advent of 3D mapping systems10 suc-
cess rates and safety have been markedly improved.
Congenitally corrected TGA is frequently associated with abnor-
malities of the systemic tricuspid valve, including dysplasia and dis-
placement of the leaflets and shows a high incidence of accessory AV
connections.10 As in patients with Ebstein’s anomaly, ablation is con-
sidered the preferred option. However, the abnormal location of AV
conduction tissue with its fragile condition warrants a supreme care
to avoid AV block and obviate the need for a permanent
pacemaker.193
In patients with AV septal defects, the connecting AV node is dis-
placed to an inferior location at the right AV valve annulus, indepen-
dent from typical margins of Koch’s triangle. The non-branching and
branching bundles are typically exposed by the defect, i.e. not cov-
ered by valvular tissue, making them more susceptible to damage.
Catheter ablation in post-operative settings
Experience with ablation of AVNRT in post-operative CHD patients
is limited.29,47,163 Its occurrence has been highlighted after Mustard
or Senning operation for D-TGA.43,198 The basic principle of ablation
in this particular post-operative anatomy is equivalent to that in nor-
mal hearts. The zone of slow AV nodal conduction in proximity to
the inferior ridge of the coronary sinus ostium at the posterior septal
portion of the tricuspid valve annulus serves as target for radiofre-
quency energy application.29,199 However, accessing this anatomical
region in Mustard/Senning patients as it is most often located in the
pulmonary venous atrium either requires a trans-aortic route, cross-
ing the aortic and subsequently the tricuspid valve, or a trans-baffle
puncture for a direct antegrade approach. Slow-pathway ablation

 occasionally may require additional radiofrequency energy applica-
tion to its ‘left-sided’ atrio-nodal input from the systemic venous
aspect.
Outcome and complications
Acute success of ablation of AVRT and AVNRT in CHD patients is
lower than reported in normal hearts with average rates of 80%.9
However, with increasing experience and implementation of electro-
anatomical mapping systems results could be improved.175 Overall,
major complication rates may reach up to 4.2% and minor complica-
tions rates of 5.5% have been reported. These figures are comparable
with complication rates in normal cardiac anatomy.191
Catheter ablation of post-operative substrates
Arrhythmogenesis
Post-operative CHD patients are prone to develop significant
tachyarrhythmias in their adulthood. Areas of dense fibrosis due to
surgical incisions, patch material, and the valve annuli are regions of
conduction block that create intervening anatomical isthmuses of
myocardium.10 Fibrosis due to longstanding cyanosis, pressure and/
or volume overload and aging may provide the substrate for slow
conduction within these anatomically defined isthmuses.30
Patients with atrial tachyarrhythmias often harbour a multifactorial
proarrhythmic state,178 complicating ablation procedures. There is
variable heterogeneous impulse propagation and slow conduction.
Scars from surgical atriotomies, suture lines for intracardiac baffles or
patches, or even radiofrequency lesions from previous ablations, may
facilitate development of preferential conduction channels or isth-
muses within scars or adjacent to anatomical barriers.178,200
Usually, the more complex the baseline substrate and the surgical
procedure, the higher the chances of developing complex atrial or
ventricular reentries.10 In general, early total repair and evolving sur-
gical strategies will likely lower the risk for acquired substrates in con-
temporary patients. In particular, in TOF patients avoiding a right

 ventriculotomy by using a transatrial–transpulmonary approach and
small transannular patches might positively impact characteristics of
anatomical isthmuses.
Prerequisites, procedural planning, and technical requirements
As ablation procedures in post-surgical patients with CHD are often
complex, a team with expertise in EP and knowledge on CHD is
mandatory in order to achieve ablation success30 (Tables 7–9).
Prerequisites for a successful procedure include evaluation of the
patient’s cardiology and surgery records and thorough pre-
procedure imaging (usually involving CT or MRI± haemodynamic
catheterization).
Fluoroscopy reduction needs to be emphasized. Nowadays elec-
trophysiological procedures should be performed according to the
As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA) principle which includes
the use of 3D mapping technology allowing to identify the exact loca-
tion of the mapping catheter and important anatomical structures
such as valve annuli, His bundle, or phrenic nerve, providing better
long-term outcomes.200,204 For mapping and ablation of AT and VT
in CHD, 3D reconstruction of all potential anatomical isthmuses facil-
itated by the use of 3D mapping systems is highly recommen-
ded.178,200,204–207 The use of irrigated-tip catheters has been
associated with an increase in ablation success rates, to overcome
limitations with lesion formation in thickened, fibrotic atrial, and ven-
tricular myocardium in CHD patients. Contact force may be helpful
as well as intracardiac echocardiography208 in regions with low ampli-
tude signals to establish electrode to tissue contact and to differenti-
ate from myocardial fibrosis. This type of actheter should be used
with caution due to its stiffness. It may be more difficult to move
around in tight channels and where one need to loop.
Catheter ablation of atrial tachycardia

creased in dedicated centres.147,172,176 Concerning ablation, AT can

 be subdivided in localized NAFAT and the more prevalent macro-
reentries. Non-automatic focal AT, defined as localized tachycardias
inducible and terminable with programmed stimulation, either reen-
trant or due to triggered activity, may account for 5–10% of all regu-
lar
ATs.169,209–211
High
ablation
success
rates
have
been
reported.43,209,211 In macroreentries, identification of the critical isth-
mus sustaining the circuit is crucial for proper ablation. The most
prevalent macroreentrant circuit is CTI-dependent, either in oper-
ated and non-operated CHD patients.43,170,171 However, the surface
ECG may not unambiguously look like classic AF depending on al-
tered anatomy. Atypical morphology does not exclude CTI depend-
ence.207 Catheter ablation aims to interrupt electrical conduction
within relevant isthmuses.
In repaired CHD individuals, most non-CTI reentries tend to re-
volve around injured tissue as incisional tachycardias at the lateral
and anterior right atrial wall.43,170,171,210,212 ‘Figure-of-eight’ circuits
may complicate understanding and ablation of such tachycardias.
Subtle abrupt electrogram changes may predict partial interruption
of the double circuit.170,171,212
In Fontan patients, MRAT tend to course along the entire lateral
right atrial wall and in vicinity to the inferior caval vein.12,170,213 In
patients after Mustard/Senning procedure MRAT predominantly in-
volve CTI.12 The same applies to patients after repair of TOF where
the area between atriotomy scar and the inferior vena cava (IVC)
may serve as an additional critical substrate.209
Based on this experience, in patients with non-inducible MRAT or
unmappable circuits, a substrate mapping approach including voltage
and activation mapping can be performed during sinus rhythm or
fixed atrial pacing.214,215 Finally, empirical CTI ablation216 as well as a
corridor between right lateral atriotomy scar and the IVC has been
advocated in non-inducible CHD patients.40
Acute ablation outcomes range between 80% in scar-related
MRAT and reach 90–95% for CTI-dependent MRAT or AF.173,217,218
Electroanatomical mapping, locating the mid-diastolic isthmus, and
adjusting the window of interest are important for ablation. Long-
term success, however, may be impaired by progressive myocardial
fibrosis, especially in complex post-operative CHD. Acute success in
MRAT ablation is defined as achievement of bi-directional conduction
block across any critically conducting myocardial isthmus or CTI.173
In the past, termination of tachycardia with ablation and subsequent
non-inducibility of the tachycardia alone were often used as endpoint
in ablation procedures. Lack of evidence of complete conduction
block, however, was idientified as a risk factor for tachycardia
recurrence.209
Procedural complications are uncommon and are usually related
to vascular access sites or application of radiofrequency near the
phrenic nerve or the His-bundle region.219,220 High-output pacing, in
order to track the course of the phrenic nerve with a electroana-
tomic mapping system, should be performed in advance to radifre-
quency delivery to the posterolateral aspect of the right atrium or
pericaval areas.
Ablation for AF has occasionally been performed in non-complex
CHD patients, basically in ASD patients, by pulmonary vein antral iso-
lation, with some groups even including SVC isolation and additional
left atrial applications in persisting AF.50,52,219–221 Echocardiographic
guidance is recommended for transseptal puncture in case of ana-
tomical distortion confusing radiological orientation, in case of ASD
closure devices or septal patches.51 There are reports that show that
results of AF ablation in CHD patients do not significantly differ from
non-CHD populations.50,219,221
Catheter ablation of ventricular tachycardia
Over the last decade tremendous progress has been made to under-
stand monomorphic sustained VT in CHD, particularly in patients
with TOF.66,67,70,201,202,223,224 The majority of monomorphic VT tar-
geted by catheter ablation are macroreentrant VT with the critical
part of the reentry circuit typically located within anatomically de-
fined isthmuses.66–68,70,201,224,225 The critical isthmus of an induced
VT can be determined by activation and entrainment mapping in hae-
modynamically tolerated VT or by pace-mapping in unstable arrhyth-
mias. Non-inducibility of any monomorphic VT has been a widely
accepted endpoint for VT ablation. In selected patients, VT induction
may no longer be a prerequisite for ablation if narrow, slow conduct-
ing and thereby potential arrythmogenic isthmuses can be identified
by electroanatomical mapping during stable sinus rhythm.67,69,223
These anatomical isthmuses can be transsected by connecting the ad-
joining
anatomical
boundaries
by
linear
radiofrequency
lesions.66,70,201,224 Demonstration of conduction block after isthmus
transection provides a defined procedural endpoint similar to that for
achieving block in the CTI. A combined endpoint of non-inducibility
and conduction block was associated with freedom of VT recurrence
during 46± 29months follow-up in a recent series of 25 CHD
patients.67
Catheter ablation is currently recommended as adjunctive therapy
to ICD patients with CHD who have recurrent monomorphic VT or
appropriate ICD therapies that are not manageable by device reprog-
ramming or drug therapy.20,226 (Table 7).
Considering the high acute success rates and low recurrence rates
VT ablation may offer a reasonable alternative to ICD therapy in
carefully selected patients with preserved cardiac function.66,67,201

 block.66–68,70,201,202,224,225 Reasons for ablation failure include hyper-
trophied myocardium, proximity of the conduction system, and im-
portantly, the protection of portions of anatomical isthmuses by
prosthetic material.66,201 In particular, a pulmonary homograft may
cover parts of the infundibular septum in TOF patients preventing
isthmus transection.
Accordingly, preoperative mapping may be considered in patients
who require reoperation or percutaneous valve replacement for pul-
monary valve regurgitation. Intraoperative cryoablation may be per-
formed in patients with clinical sustained VT and inducible sustained
monomorphic VT with an identified critical isthmus if catheter abla-
tion was unsuccessful.66,67,69,201,203,223 The role of preventive dissec-
tion of potential arrhythmogenic isthmuses in TOF patients remains
to be determined.69 (Table 8).
Surgical treatment
Amongst the three listed options for antiarrhythmic treatment in this
section, surgery plays the smallest role, at least reflected by numbers,
but may have high impact on patients’ course. Due to the growing ar-
rhythmia load in adults with CHD,141,227–232 incorporation of antiar-
rhythmic concepts into primary or particularly re-do surgery for
CHD is increasingly considered, at least in specialized centres.
Preferred targets for such combined procedures are potential future
or already existing substrates for macroreentry circuits. This strategy
may be acknowleged as a more gross strategical concept in avoiding
development of surgical tachycardia substrates.
Preventative surgery
Preventative or ‘prophylactic’ arrhythmia operations may be consid-
ered for patients with specific anatomic substrates as an effort to re-
duce the risk of late arrhythmias.54 Diagnoses include patients with
Ebstein’s anomaly, patients with ASDs over 40years of age, with
Fontan physiology, and with TOF, as those have been identified at sig-
nificant risk for late atrial arrhythmias.19,21,204,232–237 The prophylactic
CTI dissection procedure may be beneficial in selected patients un-
dergoing surgery if not managed by catheter ablation beforehand.
There is no evidence concerning the value of a left-sided Maze proce-
dure as it prolongs surgery and lack of proof of block across the lines
in the non-beating heart. In addition, interoperative Maze procedures
may cause more problems in rapid, difficult to control left ATs than
benefit. Preventive intraoperative ablation in case of re-operation e.g.
pulmonary valve replacement in TOF may be considered.203,238,239
Intraoperative treatment of pre-existing tachyarrhythmia
Intraoperative management may constitute an effective strategy to
address various arrhythmia substrates during CHD surgery, per-
formed either on an empirical basis using the knowledge of potential
arrhythmia mechanisms or ideally using information from pre-
operative endocardial mapping. Atrial fibrillation can be addressed
surgically by pulmonary vein isolation with or without more exten-
sive left atrial ablation.45 Surgical cryoablation of VT may be per-
formed at the time of pulmonary valve replacement guided by
intraoperative epicardial mapping.
Concomitant treatment of MRAT during cardiac surgery for CHD
has been reported as safe and effective with freedom from
recurrence>80% after 5 years.240–250
Indications for surgery of arrhythmias in congenital heart disease
Surgery for arrhythmias assocaited with CHD as a ‘stand-alone
procedure’ is reserved for patients in whom medical treatment and
catheter ablation techniques have failed. When a surgical intervention
is indicated, concomitant antiarrhythmic surgery may be implemented,
especially for treatment of AF, incisional AT, AF, or VT.246–250
Rhyhm control in patients with
congenital heart disease
Rhythm control devices in patients with
congenital heart disease: technical issues
While indications for device implantation in the CHD population are
similar to those with primary electrical disorders and structurally nor-
mal hearts, there are several issues that require attention prior to the
procedure. As for ablation procedures, the legacy from previous car-
diac surgery, loss of vascular access or lack of direct access to cardiac
chambers and residual devices as well as previous complications re-
lated to device implantation may be the starting point when consider-
ing device implantation in adult CHD.251–253 In contrast to patients
with structurally normal hearts, epicardial leads (sternotomy or tho-
racotomy) are frequently required as are hybrid (combined epicardial
and endocardial) and novel systems (intra-operative atrial puncture,
baffle puncture, femoral or hepatic vein access, and S-ICD coils).
Achieving the desired outcome by any route can be challenging.
Epicardial lead placement is favored in patients with intracardiac
shunts. Repeated surgical procedures may induce considerable epi-
cardial scar formation resulting in high thresholds of epicardial leads
which may cause poor system performance.254 Access to suitable
epicardium may be achieved by a partial or complete sternotomy or
right or left thoracotomy. If no suitable epicardium is found, puncture
of the target chamber and direct suture of an endocardial lead may
be an option.255 Extraction of redundant leads may facilitate access
but can be challenging as some leads have been placed for >10years
or even longer.256,257 The low profile 4.1 Fr leads may help to pre-
serve venous patency.258,259 Leadless pacemakers have several
advantages but have not been studied in the CHD population. In se-
lected patients, the S-ICD may offer an alternative solution when per-
manent pacing is not required.260–264
Subcutaneous, intrathoracic, or epicardial defibrillator coils may be
used in patients lacking access to a subpulmonary ventricle.260–262
Placement of a lead in a systemic chamber carries an increased risk of
systemic thrombembolism as long-term anticoagulation is not
completely protective. In patients with intracardiac shunts, prior/si-
multaneous device closure is mandatory.
Patients with narrowed or occluded intracardiac baffles need prior
or simultaneous recanalization and stenting to maintain access and
avoid repeated obstruction. Baffle leaks require closure as they are
also a risk factor for systemic thrombembolism.
Indication for device implantation should result in consideration of
further management strategy in the individual patient:
(1)
What surgery or catheter intervention is likely to be needed in the
short- to medium-term?
(2)
May device implantation cause an obstacle in future procedures, e.g.
tricuspid valve replacement when a transvenous lead is in place?

 (3)
Could the implantation procedure be used for simultaneous TOE, diag-
nostic catheterisation/pulmonary vascular resistance measurement or
intervention (balloon dilation or stent implantation for other lesions)?
(4)
Could device implantation be more reliably achieved during con-
comitant cardiac surgery?
(5)
Is imaging up to date and will device implantation prevent future
MRI scanning? Magnetic resonance imaging compatible systems will
allow future MRI follow-up studies of the underlying congenital
heart disease and should be used whenever possible.
Senning or Mustard repair for transposition of the great
arteries
Standard transvenous pacing with an atrial lead in the systemic ve-
nous atrium and a ventricular lead in the morphologically left ventri-
cle (LV) (subpulmonary chambers) is routinely accomplished. Pacing
the systemic venous atrial appendage may cause phrenic nerve stimu-
lation. The atrial lead should be placed at the roof of the systemic ve-
nous atrium accordingly. Lateral pacing of the morphologically LV
may stimulate the diaphragm and induce ventricular dyssynchrony—
the pacing lead should preferably be placed medially along the sep-
tum. Screw-in leads are preferred for use in the anatomically LV. For
cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), epicardial RVP combined
with transvenous left ventricular pacing is usually used. Transvenous
CRT is technically feasible using a baffle leak or baffle puncture at the
expense of an increased risk of systemic thrombembolism despite
proper anticoagulation.265
Congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries
In patients with CC-GA, CRT is often needed and can be accom-
plished via the coronary sinus if present. 266
Single ventricle physiology: Fontan circulation
Epicardial pacing is usually used. Transvenous pacing is possible by
puncturing from the main or left pulmonary artery that overlies the
atria again at the expense of an increased risk of systemic throm-
bembolism despite proper anticoagulation.267,268 Implantable cardi-
overter-defibrillator systems will need to be epicardial, hybrid, or
completely subcutaneous.
One and a half ventricle circulation
While epicardial pacing is commonly employed, there are transve-
nous strategies. In the Hemi-Fontan procedure, atrial pacing is ac-
complished by placing a lead in the SVC stump while ventricular
pacing can be achieved by puncturing the patch dividing the superor
vena cavae from the right atrium.269 If the azygos vein is patent, an
ICD coil can be placed posteriorly to the heart.270 In the classical
Glenn shunt, puncture is more challenging but the atrium and ventri-
cle can be reached. In this setting as in the Kawashima variant, trans-
hepatic pacing remains an option when no other avenue is
available.271,272
Pacemakers in patients with congenital
heart disease
Patients with CHD and post-operative SND or high degree or com-
plete AV block—even when the underlying defects are ‘structurally
repaired’—are considered to be at a higher risk of SCD. Therefore,
there is a lower threshold for pacemaker implantation even in asymp-
tomatic patients6,103,273–278 (Tables 10 and 11).

 primarily with clinical symptoms and cardiac function rather than pre-
defined heart rate limits. In the last years, several guidelines for device
implantation6,143,277,278 have been published with one study85 mainly
focusing on CHD patients.
Choosing the optimal pacing site
Location of ventricular stimulation plays a decisive role in mainte-
nance of ventricular function especially in young CHD patients who
may be paced for decades.285–289 Detailed information is provided in
the section on CRT.
Lead extraction
In CHD patients, the need for lead extraction has grown. However,
complex vascular and cardiac anatomy may be challenging. Results of
lead extraction in CHD patients are promising.290–292 Guidelines for
lead extraction293 have been published recently and are applicable
for CHD patients after taking into account the venous anatomy and
anatomical connections (Table 12).
Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator in
patients with congenital heart disease
Over the last decades, ICDs have shown to be effective in life-
threatening arrhythmias in patients with CHD. Recommendations
for risk stratification and indications for primary prevention therapy
in this aging and heterogeneous group of patients are still not well de-
fined and are based on observational cohort studies, large registries,
and expert opinions.20,30,58,61,63,294–300 Furthermore, the mode of im-
plantation and long-term management of ICD therapy in CHD
patients remains challenging (Table 13).
Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator cohorts
In CHD patients, ICD showed significant variance in specific CHD
lesions and age at implantation (Table 13). The majority of ICD recipi-
ents in the adult CHD population were young males (66%) with a
mean age at implantation of 36.5± 5.5years. Approximately 50% of
ICD recipients had repaired TOF, followed by D-TGA after atrial
switch procedure (21%), CC-TGA (5%), and septal defects (5%).293
In contrast, a study from the US National Cardiovascular Data
Registry (NCDR) reported that almost 75% of more than 3000 ICD
implants between 2010 and 2012 were performed in patients with
simple types of CHD, mainly septal defects, and probably related to
ischaemic heart disease. The mean age of patients in this registry, in-
cluding all ICD implants, was 53± 18years.300
Recommendations for implantable cardioverter-
defibrillator therapy
Secondary prevention
Evidence based guidelines for secondary prevention of SCD can be
extrapolated to the CHD population.20 Observational studies in
cohorts with different types of CHD have shown the efficacy of ICD
therapy for secondary prevention, with an average appropriate shock
rate of 35% in 4.3± 1.2 years, indicating a high annual shock rate of
8%.300 Indications for ICD implantation are summarized in Table 14.
In patients with CHD and symptomatic sustained VT, catheter abla-
tion can be a reasonable alternative or adjunct to ICD therapy in
highly selected patients with preserved ventricular function.63,294
Primary prevention
Indications for ICD therapy in patients with CHD has shifted from
secondary to primary prevention in the last two decades.
Appropriate shocks for primary prevention were reported on aver-
age in 22% of CHD patients witin 3.3± 0.3 years, indicating the annual
shock rate of 6.6%.63 Indication for primary prevention ICD implanta-
tion are listed in Table 14. Cut-off values for left and right ventricular
function in primary prevention remain undetermined. It is important
to take into account that ICD indications are based on the presence
of several risk factors. Proper selection of candidates for primary

 prevention still remains difficult and should be weighed against the
higher complication rate of ICD in CHD.
There is the general agreement that ICDs are also indicated in
adults with CHD who meet the established ICD criteria, namely a
left ventricular EF < 35%, biventricular physiology, symptomatic
heart failure despite optimal medical treatment, and NYHA func-
tional Class II or III.20 Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators
should be considered in CHD patients with syncope of unknown
origin in the presence of either advanced ventricular dysfunction
or inducible sustained VT or VF on programmed ventricular
stimulation.57

 In D-TGA patients after atrial switch operation systemic right ven-
tricular dysfunction has been identified as risk factor for SCD, but a
cut-off value for EF or other functional parameters remain
undetermined.61,292 In patients with Single V physiology, risk factors
for SCD are largely unknown. Implantation of ICD may be consid-
ered in patients with advanced single or systemic right ventricular
dysfunction, in the presence of other risk factors such as non-
sustained VT, NYHA functional Class II or III symptoms, or severe
systemic AV valve regurgitation.292 In primary prevention of patients
with TGA and Single V physiology, a history of intraatrial re-entry
tachycardia should be considered as additional risk factor and should
be addressed appropriately.
Mortality
A meta-analysis of retrospective ICD series reported an average
overall mortality of 10% during 3.7± 0.9years, indicating an annual
mortality rate of 3%. Sudden cardiac death occurred in 18% of all
deaths and heart failure in 41%. In this meta-analysis, no separate in-
formation was given on both parameters for primary and secondary
prevention. This mortality rate is much lower than reported in the
large randomized ICD trials, which can be explained by the younger
age of ICD patients with CHD as compared to ICD patients with
ischaemic and non-ischaemic cardiomyopathies.63
Complications, inappropriate shocks, and implantable cardioverter-defib-
rillator programming
Transvenous ICD systems account for more than 95% of the total
ICD in the CHD population. Approximately two-thirds were dual
chamber systems.63 Non-transvenous ICD were mostly used in chil-
dren and patients with univentricular hearts.306 The S-ICD has been
used in CHD patients with limited venous access to the ventricle or
intracardiac shunts.261,306 Data demonstrate increased inappropriate
shock rates due to oversensing.310 As the device lacks the features of
antitachycardia pacing and antibradycardia pacing, indications are lim-
ited in CHD patients.
Higher complication rates of ICD therapy during short and long-
term follow-up have been reported.294–300 including lead malfunc-
tion, device related problems, and infections including endocarditis.63
In addition, a higher prevalence of inappropriate shocks has been
reported. This may at least in part be explained by the increased inci-
dence of SVT and active lifestyles with higher risks of lead failure.
Most studies report inappropriate shock rates that equal or exceed

 the appropriate shock rates in the young CHD population. In a meta-
analysis of 518 ICD patients, inappropriate shocks were reported in
25% of patients during 3.8 years follow-up (i.e. 6.5% per year).63
Therapy with ICD may influence quality of life and psychosocial
functioning, especially in patients receiving repeated shocks. Patients
with CHD and ICD reported a high level of anxiety related to shocks
which
in
turn
was
associated
with
depression
and
sexual
dysfunction.86
Data imply that optimization of ICD settings and individual pro-
gramming is of paramount importance to reduce the number of
shocks. Recent trials have demonstrated that increasing detection
heart rates and detection duration resulted in a decrease of inappro-
priate shocks while also decreasing mortality.311,312 Finally, antitachy-
cardia pacing programming has been shown to be safe and effective
in CHD patients resulting in a reduced number of shocks.305
Discriminator algorithms, based on morphology, rhythm stability, and
onset analysis, can be useful to discriminate ATs.313 There are no
data to support the use of dual chamber ICD instead of single cham-
ber ICD in young CHD patients.312 Catheter ablation or antiarrhyth-
mic medication may be indicated in ICD patients with AT and in
selected patients with VT.20,30
Cardiac resynchronization in patients
with congenital heart disease
Dyssynchronous heart failure and cardiac
resynchronization therapy
Pathophysiology
Electromechanical dyssynchrony may cause a sequence of events
that results in pathological ventricular remodelling leading to dyssyn-
chronous heart failure.314 Dyssynchrony amenable to CRT is typically
caused by an electrical activation delay between one and the other
ventricular wall, either caused by bundle branch block or conven-
tional, typically RVP. It is characterized by clustering of early and late
contracting segments, respectively. Early electrical activation and me-
chanical contraction causes initial stretch of late activated segments.
Local myocardial work is decreased in early contracting sites that
have a low local preload and is increased in late sites where preload is
enhanced by preceding stretch.314 Part of the myocardial work is
wasted. At the same time intra-ventricular mechanical dyssynchrony
initiates partially asymmetric cellular remodelling on multiple levels,
which is reversible after CRT.315,316 Mechanical dyssynchrony may,
however, also be caused by contractile disparity and such dyssyn-
chrony is not amenable to CRT.317 Studies in adult patients with idio-
pathic or ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy indicate that the
presence of a left bundle branch block ECG pattern is a major pre-
requisite of CRT response.286,318–320
Epidemiology
Conventional ventricular pacing rather than bundle branch block is
the major source of systemic ventricular dyssynchrony in CHD.317
The exact prevalence of dyssynchronous heart failure in CHD is un-
known. In adults with a Syst RV, 9.3% of patients after Mustard or
Senning procedures and 6.1% of those with CC-TGA would be can-
didates for CRT using current indication criteria.
The most frequent conduction disturbance in CHD is right bundle
branch block in the setting of a sub-pulmonary right ventricle. Right
ventricular electromechanical dyssynchrony and mechanical ineffi-
ciency was recently described.321 However, CRT has been mainly re-
served for patients with systemic ventricular dysfunction so far.
Conventional pacing-associated dyssynchronopathy may be pre-
vented by septal or His pacing and may substantially decrease the
number of CRT candidates among CHD patients.
Imaging
Newer imaging techniques may guide appropriate selection of candi-
dates for CRT with focus on the so-called ‘classical strain pattern’320 in-
cluding speckle tracking derived strain analysis and tissue or vector
velocity imaging. However, the role of echocardiography even applying
advanced speckle tracking has been quite disappointing according to the
results of the ECHO-CRT trial although it may be helpful in selected
patients with CHD. Particularly in patients with subaortic right ventricles
there is need of preprocedural imaging of coronary sinus anatomy.
Clinical studies
Numerous studies on CRT in adults with idiopathic and ischaemic
cardiomyopathy have confirmed restoration of a normal or near-
normal electromechanical activation pattern, increase in myocardial
energy efficiency, reverse structural and cellular remodelling, func-
tional improvement, and a reduction in heart failure-associated mor-
bidity and mortality.318,322,323 Limited evidence suggests a similar role
of CRT in patients with CHD, although none of the larger studies
was prospective or randomized.324–327 Efficacy of CRT in CHD may
vary with the underlying structural and functional substrate, such as
anatomy of the systemic ventricle (left, right, or single), presence and
degree of structural systemic AV valve regurgitation, primary myo-
cardial disease or scarring, and type of electrical conduction delay.
Follow-up was largely limited to a few months, precluding an analysis
of the impact of CRT on long-term morbidity and mortality.
Outcome description was mainly limited to metrics of systemic ven-
tricular function. The following observations may be highlighted for
CRT in adult CHD55,98,283,327–331:
(1)
Conventional single-site ventricular pacing with systemic ventricular
dyssynchrony was the most prevalent (�65%) indication for CRT.
(2)
Presence of left bundle branch block along with a systemic LV in the
absence of ventricular pacing was a minor indication for CRT (9–
17%) while right bundle branch block in the presence of a Syst RV
was an even less common indication for CRT (5–7%).
(3)
The majority of patients (58%) had NYHA Class II symptoms.
(4)
An increase in systemic ventricular EF following CRT ranged be-
tween 6 and 20% while presence of a systemic LV was an indepen-
dent predictor of a greater improvement in systolic systemic
ventricular function.
(5)
The best response to CRT was observed in patients with a systemic
LV who were upgraded to CRT from conventional RVP.
(6)
CRT was effective in combination with corrective or palliative car-
diac surgery, particularly when performed to reduce systemic AV
valve regurgitation.
(7)
The proportion of CRT devices with defibrillation features was low
(<25%).
(8)
Patients with CHD awaiting heart transplantation may benefit from
screening for potentially reversible mechanical dyssynchrony.

respectively.328–330
Technical aspects
Anatomical constraints preclude implantation of transvenous CRT
systems in a significant proportion of patients with CHD necessitating
thoracotomy or hybrid lead implantation. A hybrid approach is typi-
cally used for patients with TGA after the Mustard or Senning proce-
dures. Total non-transvenous lead implantation is mostly required
for univentricular hearts with lead placement on opposing ventricular
walls which is technically very challenging.
Selection of optimal pacing site may be guided by recording the de-
lay in local electrical activation with respect to QRS onset. None of
the CHD studies to date have specifically explored the usefulness of
AV and VV delay optimization during CRT follow-up. However, in
non-responders to CRT and in those in need of atrial pacing, evalua-
tion of AV and VV delay may be justified to correct suboptimal device
settings.
No studies are so far available on the longevity of CRT devices in
the specific CHD population. Due to higher complexity these devices
may be even more susceptible to typical pacing complications.
Indications
Indications for CRT in adults with CHD have recently been
summarized.30 They are based on current European and North
American heart failure and device therapy guidelines addressing
patients with idiopathic or ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy and a
review of data on patients with congenital heart disease (Tables 15
and 16).98,283–285,319,331,335
Optimal medical therapy should be an integral part of heart failure
management prior to CRT implantation. In any individual patient, the
need for primary preventive defibrillation capability (CRT-D) should
be assessed applying current criteria.
Areas for future research
The current consensus statement reflects the tremendous progress
achieved within the last 20 years in diagnosis and management of all
types of arrhythmias in grown-ups with CHD. In addition, it docu-
ments the combined efforts of paediatric and adult electrophysiolo-
gists in the care of this growing population.
There are, however, still significant limitations in understanding
and managing of the various types of arrhythmias that need to be
overcome in the future. Although nowadays the vast majority of
CHD can be repaired by surgical or interventional therapy, there is
still a lack of understanding how arrhythmias develop in our CHD
patients. Further efforts start with optimal timing of the procedure as
well as the type of intervention for a given CHD, particularly in order
to prevent development of arrhythmias at all.
Facing the various problems encountered with pharmacological
therapy for rhythm control in young individuals with CHD, curative
treatment by catheter ablation or device implantation seems prefera-
ble. Further developments in mapping technology allowing precise
identification of the arrhythmia substrate may improve results. The
same applies to ablation technology allowing target-specific ablation.

 Further progress in leadless pacing allowing for AV synchrony in
combination with a S-ICD may help to avoid problems related to
lead failure and infection as currently encountered in device therapy
in adult CHD patients. Indications for CRT in patients with CHD as
stated in this document have been mainly derived from guidelines for
adult patients with idiopathic- or ischaemic-dilated cardiomyopathy
and adapted to the diversity of structural and functional CHD sub-
strates. Research should focus on improvement of both selection of
proper CRT candidates as well as the CRT application which may
eventually identify new patient groups that may profit from CRT.
The goal of future research on arrhythmias in grown-ups with
CHD is to rationalize the wide range of therapeutic modalities to the
diverse underlying substrates. All efforts should focus on the treat-
ment of the underlying arrhythmia, to postpone or avert heart failure,

The present consensus statement summarize knowledge and provide
recommendations on diagnosis and treatment of arrhythmias in
patients with congenital heart defects. This position paper mainly
addresses arrhythmias in adult with congenital heart disease, because,
in many cases, the anatomy and management of arrhythmias in adult
patients cannot directly be applied to patients with congenital heart
disease. There are, however, still significant limitations in understand-
ing and managing of the various types of arrhythmias that need to be
overcome in the future. Although nowadays the vast majority of
CHD can be repaired by surgical or interventional therapy, there is
still a lack of understanding how arrhythmias develop in our congeni-
tal heart disease patients. Further developments in mapping technol-
ogy allowing precise identification of the arrhythmia substrate may
improve results.
