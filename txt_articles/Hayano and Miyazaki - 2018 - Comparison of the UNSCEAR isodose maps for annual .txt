Abstract
In 2016, UNSCEAR published an attachment to its Fukushima 2015 White
Paper, entitled ‘Development of isodose maps representing annual external
exposure in Japan as a function of time’, in which the committee presented an
annual additional 1 mSv effective dose ab extra isodose lines for 1, 3, 5, 10,
30, 50 years after the accident, based on the soil deposition data of radio-
nuclides within 100 km of the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant.
Meanwhile, the median of the ratio, c, between the external effective dose
rates and the ambient dose equivalent rates 1 m above the ground obtained by
airborne monitoring has been established to be c
0.15
~
. Here, we compare
the UNSCEAR predictions with estimates based on the airborne monitoring.
Although both the methods and the data used in the two approaches are
different, the resultant contours show relatively good agreement. However, to
improve the accuracy of long-term annual effective isodose lines, feedback
from continuous measurements such as airborne monitoring is important.

1. Introduction
In 2016, in attachment 2 of UNSCEAR’s Fukushima 2015 White Paper (hereafter referred to
as Att-2) [1], as well as in an animation [2], UNSCEAR published maps showing isodose
lines for an annual additional effective dose of 1 mSv from external exposure in years 1, 3, 5,
10, 30 and 50 years after the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant (FDNPP) accident.
UNSCEAR estimated isodose lines based on radionuclide soil deposition data obtained from
soil samples collected between 6 June 2011 and 8 July 2011 within 100 km from the FDNPP.
The data were released by the Japanese Government in 2011 [3] and were reproduced by
UNSCEAR with geospatial information on a 1 km grid [4]. Att-2 provides a table (table 2 of
[1]) of the conversion coefficients from soil deposition density of radiocaesium to annual
effective dose ab extra (mSv MBqm 2
- ) for each year from years 1 to 10, then at every 10
years from years 10 to 50, and 100. Using the soil deposition data and the effective dose
conversion coefficients, it is possible to estimate the annual additional effective dose from
external exposure at each grid point around the FDNPP.
Meanwhile, Miyazaki and Hayano [5] analyzed data from a large-scale ‘glass-badge’
individual dose monitoring (with geographical information system (GIS) data of the residents’
addresses) conducted by Date City, Fukushima Prefecture, together with the airborne mon-
itoring data collected periodically by the Japanese Government, and found that the ratio c of
ambient dose equivalent rate to the effective dose rate from external exposure is nearly
constant between 5 and 51 months after the accident, at c
0.15
~
[5]. Using this relationship,
it becomes possible to draw annual 1 mSv isodose lines based on the airborne monitor-
ing data.
In this paper, we compare the 1 mSv annual isodose lines predicted by UNSCEAR with
those obtained based on the airborne monitoring for 3 and 5 years after the accident, and
discuss the implications.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Reproduction of the UNSCEAR isodose lines
UNSCEAR’s 1 mSv annual isodose line maps were created by using (1) the 134Cs and 137Cs
soil deposition density data released by the Japanese Government, rebuilt by UNSCEAR on a
1km mesh in units of MBq m 2
- , and (2) dose conversion coefficients from soil deposition
density to the annual additional effective dose (table 2 of Att-2). Since the results are shown
only as maps, we calculated the annual cumulative effective dose at each 1 km grid point, and
reconstructed annual isodose lines of 1 mSv, 3 and 5 years after the accident (by using,
respectively, the difference of 2nd and 3rd year cumulative dose coefficients and that of 4th
and 5th). The agreement was satisfactory but not perfect, due to differences in the inter-
polation algorithms used for each.
2.2. Isodose lines based on the airborne monitoring maps
The isodose lines based on the airborne monitoring maps were generated as follows.
For the annual additional effective dose 3 (5) years after the accident, we used the 8th
(10th) airborne monitoring data for which the reference date of dose calculation is 19
November 2013 (2 November 2015), as indicated in figure 1. By multiplying the ambient

- ) at each airborne monitoring grid point by the factor

[5], the median value of the external effective dose rate of the population living in
the vicinity of the grid point was obtained.
Since the ambient dose equivalent rate 1 m above the ground H

) gradually decreased
over time, we cannot simply use the dose rate on the reference date of airborne monitoring as
a representative of the whole year. We therefore fitted, as shown in figure 1, the ratios of the
ambient dose rate from the 5th through 11th airborne monitoring at each monitoring grid
point to that from the 4th monitoring (AM5 through AM11 in figure 1), with a model function
that considers physical and environmental attenuation,

 additional effective dose from external exposure maps created using the factor c = 0.15 were
interpolated to draw 1 mSv annual isodose lines.
3. Results
In figure 2 top (bottom), isodose lines for an annual additional effective dose of 1 mSv for 3
(5) years after the accident are overlaid on the 8th (10th) airborne monitoring map. The 1 mSv
isodose lines shown in blue are the recalculated UNSCEAR estimate, and the contours in red
are the 1 mSv isodose line estimated from the airborne monitoring results, converted to
annual effective dose rates with the factor c = 0.15. Also superimposed are (hatched regions)
the isodose bands between c = 0.10 (25th percentile) and c = 0.22 (75th percentile),
reflecting the distribution of the factor c as presented in figure 5 of [5]. Presumably, uncer-
tainties may be also inherent in the UNSCEAR’s estimate (blue line), but they are not
explicitly discussed in [1].
In both years, the isodose lines independently calculated with different methods are in
fairly close agreement, but on closer examination, the UNSCEAR predicted isodose line
(blue) encloses a smaller area than the line based on actual measurements derived in this study
(red), the difference being slightly greater for the 5th year.
4. Discussion
After the FDNPP accident, an airborne monitoring method has been established and carried
out regularly [7], and the ambient dose equivalent rates have been released as maps and
numerical data [8]. Using the data of the large-scale individual dose monitoring conducted by
Date City, Fukushima Prefecture, Miyazaki et al [5] found that the personal dose equivalent
(≈the effective dose) monitored by glass-badges, and the ambient dose equivalent of the
residential area from airborne monitoring are closely correlated.
Naito et al [9] used the airborne monitoring database and individual dosemeters (D-
Shuttle) along with a global positioning system, possessed by approximately 100 voluntary
participants, and obtained a conversion factor of c
0.2
~
. In a more recent study by Naito
et al [10], targeting 38 voluntary residents of Iitate village, Fukushima Prefecture, the
coefficient was c
0.13
~
for time spent at home and c
0.18
~
for time spent outdoors.
The results of these well-controlled studies targeting a small number of participants are
thus consistent with the large-scale ‘glass-badge’ result of [5]. These works have established
that the results of the airborne monitoring can be used to assess the median effective doses of
the groups residing in areas defined by the airborne-survey grid points. In the present study,
we used c = 0.15, the coefficient obtained from the Date City glass-badge survey data.
UNSCEAR, in Att-2 of their 2015 White Paper [1], predicted the long-term cumulative
effective dose ab extra after the Fukushima accident. In Att-2, estimates of cumulative
effective dose up to 100 years after the accident are shown in terms of 137Cs deposition
density as of 14 June 2011. They also published a GIF animation their website at the same
time; isodose lines for an annual additional effective dose ab extra in the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 10th,
30th and 50th years after the accident were presented. Comparison of the isodose line of
annual additional effective dose of 1 mSv estimated by UNSCEAR and the isodose line
estimated from the data obtained by airborne monitoring with the factor c = 0.15 [5] shows
relatively good agreement, despite the widely differing methods employed.
However, on a closer examination, a trend in which UNSCEAR’s isodose line encloses a
smaller area than that generated in the present work is evident. The reason for this small but

 noticeable difference can be understood by comparing the attenuation of the ambient dose rate
deduced from the airborne monitoring, with that assumed in the UNSCEAR’s prediction. The
attenuation curve obtained by analyzing the airborne monitoring data (in red), already shown
in figure 1, is reproduced in figure 3. In comparison, a curve (in blue) for the attenuation of
effective dose rates of representative population group calculated from the levels of
deposition of radionuclides on the soil is superimposed using the parameters assumed in
UNSCEAR’s prediction, as described in detail in [11]. In UNSCEAR’s model, the attenuation

asymptote to the physical decay curve. The UNSCEAR’s g(t) has two, almost similar

UNSCEAR’s prediction is useful for policy-makers, it is necessary to update it continuously
based on the latest diachronic monitoring data.
5. Conclusions
In this paper, we compared two different methods to estimate the individual external doses of
the public residing in the Fukushima Prefecture caused by radioactive fallout following the
FDNPP accident in 2011. One is the method adopted by UNSCEAR, which makes use of the
official soil deposition map. The other makes use of airborne monitoring maps, together with
an empirical factor c = 0.15 obtained by comparing the large-scale ‘glass-badge’ dosemeter
measurements and airborne surveys. Although the two are independent and are based on
different data and methodologies, the resultant isodose lines for an annual additional dose of 1
mSv 3 and 5 years after the FDNPP accident show relatively good agreement. However, to
improve the accuracy of long-term annual effective isodose lines, feedback from continuous
measurements such as airborne monitoring is important.
