ABSTRACT
Previous studies suggest that bone loss and fracture risk are associated with higher inflammatory milieu, potentially modifiable by
diet. The primary objective of this analysis was to evaluate the association of the dietary inflammatory index (DII), a measure of the
inflammatory potential of diet, with risk of hip, lower-arm, and total fracture using longitudinal data from the Women’s Health
Initiative Observational Study and Clinical Trials. Secondarily, we evaluated changes in bone mineral density (BMD) and DII scores. DII
scores were calculated from baseline food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) completed by 160,191 participants (mean age 63 years)
without history of hip fracture at enrollment. Year 3 FFQs were used to calculate a DII change score. Fractures were reported at least
annually; hip fractures were confirmed by medical records. Hazard ratios for fractures were computed using multivariable-adjusted
Cox proportional hazard models, further stratified by age and race/ethnicity. Pairwise comparisons of changes in hip BMD, measured
by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry from baseline, year 3, and year 6 were analyzed by quartile (Q1 ¼ least inflammatory diet) of
baseline DII scores in a subgroup of women (n ¼ 10,290). Mean DII score improved significantly over 3 years (p < 0.01), but change
was not associated with fracture risk. Baseline DII score was only associated with hip fracture risk in younger white women
(HR Q4,1.48; 95% CI, 1.09 to 2.01; p ¼ 0.01). There were no significant associations among white women older than 63 years or other
races/ethnicities. Women with the least inflammatory DII scores had less loss of hip BMD (p ¼ 0.01) by year 6, despite lower baseline
hip BMD, versus women with the most inflammatory DII scores. In conclusion, a less inflammatory dietary pattern was associated
with less BMD loss in postmenopausal women. A more inflammatory diet was associated with increased hip fracture risk only in
white women younger than 63 years. © 2016 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

 evidence that chronic inflammation is related to adverse
skeletal outcomes.
Dietary components have been shown to modify inflamma-
tion through both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory
mechanisms.(4–6) However, a single food or nutrient may not be
sufficient to reduce fracture risk in postmenopausal women.(7,8)
Describing the functional effects of combinations of foods as
they are eaten by free-living humans and as they describe
inflammation has proven to be effective at predicting disease
outcomes.(9) Previous research has shown that the overall
dietary pattern or diet quality may be more relevant to disease
risk than intake of individual foods or nutrients.(10–12) Diet
quality, as
measured
by
various
instruments, has
been
associated with markers of inflammation such as C-reactive
protein (CRP).(13–15) Additionally, a growing body of research
suggests that higher-quality dietary patterns are favorably
associated with bone mineral density (BMD)(16–18) and fracture
risk(19) in older adults. However, it is unknown if a dietary pattern
that is associated with more inflammation will increase fracture
risk in older adults.
The Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) was developed to assess
the overall quality of the diet on a continuum from maximally
anti-inflammatory to maximally pro-inflammatory.(14,20) This
index was created by assigning a score for each food and
constituent (eg, nutrients and other parameters, including
flavonoids) reported to positively or negatively affect levels of
specific inflammatory markers (interleukin-1b [IL-1b], IL-4, IL-6,
IL-10, tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNFa], and CRP) using the
available evidence from over 1900 relevant peer-reviewed
journal articles. The DII was designed to quantify the overall
effect of diet on inflammation, using weighted scores based on
quality of study design, type of study (eg, cell, animal, human)
and number of published articles for each food component–
inflammatory biomarker relationship that comprise the DII. An
important unique design feature of the DII is that it is not
dependent on recommendations of intake or findings from
single population means. Rather, it is based on results published
in scientific literature and then standardized to global values of
intake for all DII food parameters. Recently, the DII has been
updated to incorporate studies published from 2007 to 2010.(20)
The DII has been assessed relative to biomarkers of inflamma-
tion: using high-sensitivity CRP in a longitudinal study of healthy
adults(21) and using CRP, TNFa receptor 2 (TNF-R2) and IL-6 in a
subset of participants in the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI)
Observational Study (WHI-OS).(22) Specifically, in the WHI
validation study, a higher inflammatory score on the DII
predicted higher serum IL-6 and higher TNF-R2 (beta estimate,
1.26; 95% CI, 1.15 to 1.38; p for trend <0.0001 and beta estimate,
81.43; 95% CI, 19.15 to 143.71; p for trend ¼ 0.004, respectively).
The DII also has been used in several large cohorts, including the
WHI, to investigate relationships between diet quality related to
inflammation and various outcomes, including metabolic
syndrome, asthma, breast cancer, and colorectal cancer.(9,23–26)
There has been one recent report of a beneficial association with
BMD of the lumbar spine and a less inflammatory DII score in a
small, cross-sectional cohort of Iranian women(27); thus far, no
one has investigated the impact of the DII in relation to
longitudinal changes in BMD or fracture, the final, debilitating
clinical outcome of osteoporosis.
The primary objective of this analysis was to evaluate the
association of an inflammatory diet pattern, as represented by
baseline DII score, with risk of fracture (defined as hip, lower-
arm, and total fracture) using longitudinal data from the WHI.
We also tested for effect modification by age and race/ethnicity,
as well as by calcium intake. Our secondary objectives were (1) to
examine the association of change in DII scores from baseline to
year 3 with risk of fractures and (2) to examine the relation of DII
score to changes in BMD over 6 years of follow-up. Because
fractures were one of the main outcome measures when the
WHI was originally designed, and nutritional data as well as BMD
data were collected in a large subset of the cohort,(28) this offers
a unique opportunity to examine exposure to an inflammatory
diet pattern and risk of fracture and explore underlying
mechanistic pathways involving BMD.
Subjects and Methods
Subjects
The WHI is the largest study of postmenopausal women’s health
ever undertaken in the United States. The focus of the WHI is on
prevention and control of common diseases impacting older
women, including osteoporotic fractures. Details of the study
design and methods have been published.(28) Briefly, ethnically
and racially diverse women (n ¼ 161,808) between 50 and
79 years of age were enrolled between 1993 and 1998. Of these,
68,132 women joined one or more of the three randomized
clinical trials (CT): (1) placebo-controlled hormone therapy (HT)
trials with estrogen alone or estrogen plus progestin; (2) a low-fat
dietary modification (DM) trial compared with usual diet; and
(3) a calcium plus vitamin D supplement (CaD) trial compared
with placebo. Women who were not eligible or interested in the
clinical trials (n ¼ 93,676) enrolled in the observational study
(OS). Procedures were reviewed and approved by the Human
Subjects Review Committee at each of the 40 participating
clinical centers nationwide, at which participants provided
written informed consent. The study population for this analysis
included women from both the OS and CT who completeda food
frequency questionnaire (FFQ) at baseline from which a DII score
was calculated (n ¼ 161,595). We excluded women who reported
history of hip fracture at baseline (n ¼ 1404). A total of 160,191
participants constituted the analytic dataset. BMD data for this
analysis were from the subgroup of 10,290 OS and CT women
who had serial measurements at baseline, year 3, and year 6. The
BMD cohort was oversampled for ethnic/racial minorities and,
therefore, is not representative of WHI as a whole.
Calculation of the DII
The development of the original DII and the revised version have
been described.(10,16) Briefly, to develop the latest DII, scientific
literature published through 2010 was reviewed for relation-
ships between food components or “parameters” and specific
inflammatory markers. Positive or negative values were assigned
to each article based on the effect of the food parameter on
inflammation (ie, þ1 ¼ pro-inflammatory relationship, 0 ¼ no
significant relationship with inflammatory marker, –1 ¼ anti-
inflammatory relationship). Articles were weighted by quality of
study design and type of study (eg, cell study ¼ 3, human
experimental ¼ 10). An inflammatory effect score for each food
parameter was calculated based on the number of pro-
inflammatory and anti-inflammatory articles and adjusted based
on the total weighted number of articles. To avoid over or under
estimation of any one food parameter on overall score, an
individual’s dietary intake was standardized to mean intakes
from a global composite dataset created for this purpose and
converted to percentiles for calculation of an overall DII score.(16)

 The DII was designed to assess the overall inflammatory
potential of the diet; it was not intended for use in evaluating
individual food components included in the index and
relationship of those individual components with health
outcomes.
In this analysis, the DII was calculated for each participant
based on 32 food components (Table 1) obtained from the WHI
FFQ responses that assessed usual food intake in the previous
3 months and data on use of the following dietary supplements:
iron, magnesium, niacin, riboflavin, selenium, thiamine, beta
carotene, zinc, folic acid, and vitamins A, C, D, E, B6, and B12.(29)
The original DII contained 45 food components, but the
following components were not available in the WHI FFQ:
ginger, turmeric, garlic, oregano, pepper, rosemary, eugenol,
saffron, flavan-3-ol, flavones, flavonols, flavonones, and antho-
cyanidins.(22) Because these components are typically consumed
in small quantities in most of the population, previous studies,
including the WHI, indicate that their absence has virtually no
effect on DII scores.(21,22) DII scores for the baseline WHI FFQ
were used for primary analyses in this research. DII scores
computed from FFQ data in year 3 of WHI also were used to
secondarily examine change in dietary pattern in relation to
fracture risk. In order to examine relationships between different
levels of DII scores and outcomes of interest, we divided the DII
into quartiles with the following cut points: Q1: –7.05 to � –2.81;
Q2: > –2.81 to � –1.21; Q3: > –1.21 to � 1.49; and Q4: >1.49 to
5.78. A higher range of DII scores (eg, Q4) represents a more
inflammatory diet pattern.
Fracture and BMD ascertainment
Data on incident fractures were self-reported by participants on
a health update questionnaire, collected every 6 months, either
at clinic visit or by mail or phone for women in the CTs. OS
participants completed the questionnaires by mail or phone
annually. Proxy interviews were conducted for women who
missed clinic visits or were unable to complete questionnaires
alone. Medical records (radiology, surgery reports) were
requested for all hip fractures in the entire WHI cohort, and
for all fractures reported in the clinical trials and at the three
BMD centers. Total fractures were defined as all fractures except
those of fingers, toes, ribs, sternum/chest, skull/face, and cervical
vertebrae. Hip fractures were centrally adjudicated by trained
and blinded physicians. There was 96% agreement between
central and local adjudication of hip fractures.(30) Additionally,
81% of self-reported lower-arm/wrist fractures and 71% of all
single-site fractures were confirmed in a subset of WHI
participants (n ¼ 6652) after an average of 4.3 years of follow-
up(31); however, validity of self-reported clinical spine fractures
was relatively low (51%) in this same subset, therefore, we chose
not to include spine fractures as an outcome in this analysis.
BMD of the total hip, lumbar spine (L2-L4), and total body was
measured in women at three participating US clinical centers
(Birmingham, AL; Tucson/Phoenix, AZ; and Pittsburgh, PA) using
dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (QDR 2000, 2000þ, or 4500 W;
Hologic Inc, Bedford, MA, USA). BMD data were obtained by
certified technicians using standard protocols(32) at baseline
randomization and at annual visits in years 3, 6, and 9. WHI
quality assurance protocols included routine spine and hip
phantoms and a random sample review. Calibration phantoms
between the three clinical sites were in close agreement
(interscanner variability <1.5% for the spine, <4.8% for the hip,
and <1.7% for linearity).(32,33)
Covariate measurement
Covariates, selected based on previously defined impact on
fracture risk, BMD, or inflammation, included age, race/ethnicity,
CT participation, parental history of fracture, personal history of
fracture at 55 years or older, smoking status (current, never,
past),
physical
activity
(recreational
activity
assessed
by
questionnaire and expressed as Metabolic Equivalents), geo-
graphical region, treated diabetes, female hormone use,
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or corticosteroid
use, total calcium intake (diet plus supplements) at baseline,
randomization to CaD treatment arm, inflammatory bowel
disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and baseline weight and height.
We did not include dietary variables such as alcohol and
personal vitamin D supplement use as covariates because they
were included as part of the DII calculation.
Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics by baseline DII quartiles were performed
using ANOVA for continuous variables and chi square test for
categorical variables. We used Cox proportional hazards

 regression model to determine the association between DII
quartiles at baseline and risk of fracture at various sites (total
fracture, lower-arm fracture, and hip fracture). Three models
were examined: unadjusted, age- and race-adjusted, and a fully
adjusted model, which included all covariates described in
Covariate measurement. In order to examine the effect of energy
intake on fracture risk, analyses were repeated with a modified
DII score that did not include energy, and then models were
adjusted for total energy intake (kcal/day). Results did not
change appreciably; therefore, results of analyses using the
original DII score with daily energy intake included are shown.
We also evaluated the relationship of the DII to fracture
outcomes using a continuous scale. Among women who
experienced fracture, follow-up duration was defined as time
to first fracture. For women who did not experience fracture
during the follow-up period (ie, through September 30, 2010),
follow-up duration was defined as time until last follow-up visit,
or death, whichever came first.
Multipleimputations usingdiscriminant functionmethodwere
performed in order to assess the impact of the large amount of
missing responses to questions about personal and parental
historyoffracture.Thesameimputeddata sets(n ¼ 10)wereused
infittingboth Cox modelsandlinear mixed regressionmodels. All
p values are two-sided, and 95% CIs are provided to indicate
precision and statistical significance. SAS software (version 9.3;
SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) was used in all analyses.
We tested the assumption that the hazard ratio of the primary
predictor remained constant over time by introducing a
cross-product term for DII�log (time) into the statistical model.
The proportionality assumption was not violated. For all models,
there were no significant two-way interactions with any of the
covariates and DII quartiles. Tests for linear trend were
performed using standard orthogonal contrasts. We examined
effect modification by stratifying according to calcium intake
(because of the large difference in calcium intake between
women in different quartiles of the DII) and by age and race
(because of changing direction of association in some Cox
models when these covariates were included). In addition, we
performed several sensitivity analyses: (1) excluding women in
the treatment arm of the DM clinical trial; (2) excluding women
who fractured after the end date (2005) of the original WHI
studies; and (3) excluding women in the treatment arm of the HT
trial or those using medications known to affect bone.
To address our secondary aims, a paired t test was used to
compare the baseline DII score versus DII score at year 3. Cox
models were used to determine the association between
change in DII quartiles and risk of fracture at various sites,
using the same covariates as in the fracture models. Incident
fractures occurring before year 3 were excluded from the
change in DII analysis. Linear mixed regression models
were fitted with DII quartiles as predictors and BMD (percent
change from baseline: [(follow-up BMD – baseline BMD)/
baseline BMD]�100) as the primary outcome to examine the
association of DII score to change in BMD over time. This allowed
us to normalize all BMD data to baseline. Bonferroni correction
was used for multiple comparisons.
Results
Participant characteristics
Baseline characteristics of the study population by quartiles (Q)
of the DII score are reported in Table 2. WHI participants were 50
to 79 years old at enrollment; average age of participants in this
sample was 63 years old. A total of 47,974 incident fracture cases,
including 3837 centrally adjudicated hip fracture cases were
identified in the CT and OS as of September 30, 2010. Mean � SD
length of follow-up was 11.4 � 3.3 years. The range of DII scores
in the study population at baseline was from –7.0 to 5.8, with a
mean � SD of –0.7 � 2.7; a lower number indicates a less
inflammatory dietary pattern. Compared to Q1, women in Q4 (a
more inflammatory diet) were younger, more likely to be black
or Hispanic, be current smokers, be treated for diabetes, report
less physical activity and fewer falls, have lower total calcium
intake, and a higher BMI (BMI Q1: 27.25 versus Q4: 28.86 kg/m2).
Fewer women in Q4 were taking female hormones and fewer
reported a family history of fractures or a personal fracture at
�55 years of age.
DII and fracture outcomes
Table 3 details Cox proportional hazard ratios (HRs) for risk of
fracture at various skeletal sites based on quartiles of the DII at
baseline. Women with high DII (more inflammatory) scores had a
significantly higher risk of hip fracture in models adjusted for
age and race (Q4 HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.23; p for linear trend
0.02); however, the association was no longer significant after
multivariable adjustment. Conversely, in fully adjusted models
for lower-arm fracture and total fracture, risk decreased by 8%
(p for linear trend 0.02) and 5% (p for linear trend <0.01),
respectively, in women with the most inflammatory diet. Similar
results were seen when risk of fracture by DII score was evaluated
on a continuous scale. Results are shown in Supporting Table 1.
We found no evidence of interaction or mediation by any of the
covariates in the model. Although we controlled for multiple
covariates in our statistical models, we did not include falls
because falls are inthe causal pathway for fractures. However, we
did test for an association of DII score and risk of falls, and found a
7% lowerrisk inwomen withthe most inflammatoryscore (HRQ4
vs Q1, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.92 to 0.95; p for trend <0.001).
Because of the large difference in calcium consumption
between women in highest and lowest DII quartiles, we
stratified women by daily calcium intake from diet plus
supplements and then constructed fully adjusted Cox models
to determine the association of DII quartiles and fracture by
strata (Supporting Table 2). Risk for lower-arm fracture
decreased significantly only for women who were consuming
at least 1200 mg of calcium per day and had a more pro-
inflammatory DII score (Q4 HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.76 to 1.00; p for
linear trend 0.05); a similar, but nonsignificant association was
noted for total fracture risk. In contrast, there was a trend toward
increased risk of hip fracture in women consuming a more
inflammatory dietary pattern plus at least 1200 mg of calcium
per day, but this association did not reach statistical significance
(Q4 HR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.96 to 1.45; p for linear trend 0.12). No
statistically significant interaction was observed for calcium and
the DII in any of the fracture models (calcium�DII interaction
p values: 0.14 hip, 0.43 lower-arm, 0.78 total fracture).
To further investigate the influence of consuming an
inflammatory diet on fracture risk in younger versus older
women of varying races, we stratified our sample by median age
(63 years) and race/ethnicity (white versus other). Results of fully
adjusted Cox models are presented in Table 4. Risk for hip
fracture significantly increased in women in the most inflam-
matory diet quartile who were younger than 63 years and white
(Q4 HR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.09 to 2.01; p for linear trend 0.01); a similar

DII, BMD, AND FRACTURE RISK IN POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN

 direction of association was seen in women younger than
63 years old of other races/ethnicities consuming more
inflammatory diets, but confidence intervals were wide and
there was no significant linear trend (Q4 HR, 1.32; 95% CI, 0.42 to
4.12; p for linear trend 0.51). In contrast, there was no evidence of
association in older women, with the exception that a
statistically significant linear trend (p ¼ 0.03) toward a very
modest decreased risk of total fractures was observed in women
consuming more inflammatory diets who were 63 years or older
and white, though none of the individual HRs in upper quartiles
were less than 0.95 or statistically significant.
To account for possible changing composition of dietary
intake or changes in the food supply related to fortified foods
over the follow-up period, we analyzed change in DII scores from
baseline to year 3 in relation to fracture risk. The mean change in
DII scores over the 3-year period was small, but statistically
significant, and in the anti-inflammatory direction (mean change
in DII score, –0.4 � 2.4; p < 0.01). There were no significant
associations with change in DII scores and fracture risk at any
skeletal site. Data are available in Supporting Table 3.
To further investigate the association of DII scores to fracture
risk in subgroups within WHI, we conducted several sensitivity
analyses. Results were essentially unchanged when models
excluded women in the dietary treatment arm of the DM trial or
those who fractured after 2005, the end date of the original WHI
studies. Similarly, we controlled for randomization arm to the
CaD trial and found no significant changes in results (data not
shown). However, when we excluded women who reported
taking bone-active medications (female hormones, bisphosph-
onates, corticosteroids, or selective estrogen receptor modu-
lators) at baseline or those in the active treatment arm of the HT
clinical trial, magnitude of risk for hip fracture increased to 15%
in
women

inflammatory
diet
(Q4
multivariable HR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.94 to 1.42), although this was
not statistically significant (p for linear trend 0.35). In contrast,
women in the highest quartile of DII scores had a 13% decreased
risk of lower-arm fractures (Q4 HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.77 to 0.99; p for
linear trend 0.04), and an 8% lower total fracture risk (Q4 HR,
0.92; 95% CI, 0.86 to 0.98; p for linear trend 0.01). Results are
available in Supporting Table 4.
DII and BMD
Percent change in total hip BMD was analyzed by pairwise
comparisons of Q4 versus Q1 baseline DII scores over 6 years of
follow-up. There were 8303 women who had baseline hip BMD
and complete covariate data included in these analyses. After
multivariable adjustment, women with the least inflammatory
dietary pattern (Q1) had a more positive overall change in hip
BMD (p for linear trend <0.001) (Fig. 1A). When BMD was
evaluated by visit year, women in Q1 had lower mean hip BMD at
baseline, but lost less BMD at the hip by year 6 than women with
the most inflammatory dietary pattern. Similar results were seen
in subgroup analysis of approximately 3275 women with BMD
data who were not on bone-active medications (ie, corticoste-
roids, bisphosphonates, SERMS, female hormones, or randomi-
zation to HT treatment arm) at the baseline visit (Fig. 1B).
Discussion
This large prospective study examined the association of an
inflammatory dietary pattern, as measured by the DII, with risk of
fracture and changes in BMD in postmenopausal women who
were part of the WHI. This is the first investigation of the DII and
fracture outcomes and changes in BMD. Women with the lowest
DII scores (least inflammatory diet) lost significantly less BMD at
the hip over 6 years of follow-up compared to women with the
most inflammatory diet pattern. Additionally, in women who
were younger than 63 years and white, a higher DII score was
associated with increased risk of hip fracture.. Conversely, risk of

 total fracture and lower-arm fracture was modestly lower in
women with the most inflammatory DII scores. After stratifica-
tion analysis by age and race, this trend was observed only for
total fractures in white women who were 63 years or older.
A higher-quality diet has been associated with lower
inflammation(13,14,22) and lower fracture risk(34) in older adults.
Diet quality, as measured by mean baseline DII scores in our
sample of WHI women, was similar to other cohorts of older
women and men in the United States(21,35) and varied widely,
similar to a previous analysis of WHI participants.(26) In our
analysis, DII score decreased slightly over the initial 3 years of
WHI enrollment, indicating a small shift toward a less
inflammatory diet during the study period. Nevertheless, we
found no association with change in DII scores and fracture
outcomes. Our results are somewhat similar to those reported
from the WHI-DM trial, in which there was no difference in
fracture risk between controls and women in the intervention
group, who were deliberately changing their diet.(36) Changes in
diet patterns that include foods known to reduce bone
turnover,(18) as well as foods to lower inflammation, may be
required to alter fracture risk in postmenopausal women.
DII and fracture outcomes
Compared to women in the lowest quartile (Q1) of DII scores,
women in our sample with the most pro-inflammatory DII scores
(Q4) had a 12% higher risk of hip fracture in minimally adjusted
models. However, this association was no longer statistically
significant after multivariable adjustment. Further stratification
by age and race/ethnicity revealed an increased risk of hip
fracture in white women younger than 63 years with the most
inflammatory DII scores, and a similar, though nonsignificant
direction of association, in younger women of other races/
ethnicities. This suggests that a high-quality, less inflammatory
diet may be especially important in reducing hip fracture risk in
younger women. A healthy, nutrient-dense dietary pattern was
associated with lower risk of fragility fractures in Chinese men
and women,(34) but unlike our study, older Chinese women
seemed to obtain particular benefit to bone from a healthy diet.
This could be related to differences in instruments used to assess
diet quality, as well as population characteristics. We hypothe-
sized that a more inflammatory DII score would increase risk of
fracture. We found evidence of this only in relation to hip
fracture risk in younger women, particularly those who were
white. There could be several reasons for these results. First, it
could be that the benefits of a less inflammatory dietary pattern
for bone health are overshadowed by the much greater risk
for fracture produced by aging. Robbins and colleagues(37) have
shown in previous work within WHI that age is by far
the strongest predictor of hip fracture. Second, previous WHI
results suggest that levels of inflammatory markers are a
stronger predictor of hip fracture risk in white women compared
to other races and ethnicities.(2) Third, our power to detect
relationships between diet and fracture outcomes was greatest
for white women because 82% of women in our sample were
white. Finally, the dietary intake of minority women, particularly
certain Hispanic populations, may not have been well captured
by the WHI FFQ.(38)
Some nutrients known to be important to bone health,
particularly calcium, are not included in the DII because of lack of
evidence of a relation with inflammation.(20) Other diet quality
indices that include dairy products has been associated with
beneficial trends in risk of hip fractures in a Chinese cohort(34)

 and in the WHI,(39) suggesting that more than just inflammatory
potential needs to be considered when examining diet and
bone relationships. To account for this, we adjusted for calcium
intake and assignment to the active group of the CaD trial in our
statistical models, and examined associations stratified by
calcium intake. Only in women consuming at least 1200 mg/day
of calcium plus a less inflammatory diet, was there a trend
toward lower hip fracture risk, further supporting the impor-
tance of an overall healthy dietary pattern for skeletal benefit in
postmenopausal women.
In contrast to our hypothesis, we found a modestly lower risk
of lower-arm and total fractures in women with the most
inflammatory DII scores. After stratification by age and race/
ethnicity, this trend was significant only in older white women.
We have found this same, unexpected, inverse direction of
association in other analyses of anti-inflammatory dietary
components and risk for lower-arm or total fractures in
WHI.(7,40) It is possible that this linear trend may be related to
increased risk of falls accompanying a more active lifestyle in
women eating a healthy diet. Indeed, we did find that women
with the least inflammatory DII scores were more physically
active and were at slightly greater risk of falls. In other large
studies that have included women, more physical activity in the
perimenopausal and postmenopausal period has been associ-
ated with greater risk of wrist fractures resulting from falls.(41,42)
Furthermore, when we stratified our sample by calcium intake,
only in women consuming at least 1200 mg/day of calcium plus
a less inflammatory diet was lower-arm fracture risk significantly
increased. That risk increased in women with the healthiest
dietary pattern and highest calcium intake supports our
speculation that lower-arm fractures are influenced by non-
dietary factors, such as falls accompanying physical activity.
DII and BMD
In our analysis, women with the least inflammatory dietary
pattern (Q1 of DII) had lower mean hip BMD at baseline. Baseline
BMD represents an accumulation of years of changes in bone,
but the baseline FFQ from which the DII was calculated reflects a
measure of usual intake over the previous 3 months, which may
not accurately represent previous long-term dietary exposure.
Additionally, more women in the lowest quartile of the DII were
older, white, and had lower BMI, which may have increased risk
for lower BMD. However, despite these risk factors, a less
inflammatory dietary pattern appeared to offer some protection
from loss of BMD at the hip over 6 years of follow-up. It is
possible that our results were influenced by regression toward
the mean, but this seems unlikely because our sample size was
large and BMD values were normally distributed. Our results are
similar to the only other analysis of the DII and BMD to date, a
cross-sectional study of 160 postmenopausal Iranian women,
from which researchers reported that a less inflammatory DII
score was associated with significantly higher BMD of the
lumbar spine, and a nonsignificantly higher BMD of the femoral
neck.(27)
Strengths and limitations
The strengths of this study include the prospective design, the
large and well-established cohort of geographically and racially/
ethnically diverse women, central adjudication of hip fracture,
availability of serial measures of BMD in a subset of the sample,
and testing of outcomes in relation to longitudinal change in DII
score. This study also had several limitations. This was an
observational study of postmenopausal women; generalizability
of the results is limited to this high-risk group. The OS and CT
cohorts had different follow-up schedules (CT every 6 months,
OS annually); therefore, precision of follow-up data may differ for
outcomes. Lower-arm fractures and a portion of total fractures
were self-reported, which could result in misclassification error,
although, as previously discussed in section Fracture and BMD
ascertainment, agreement between self-report and adjudicated
fracture outcomes was high. Although the DII was designed to
assess the overall inflammatory potential of the diet, it is possible
that an individual food component or small number of
components may primarily drive the association with fracture
risk. Data from FFQs were used to derive DII scores; self-reported
dietary data have known measurement error. For women who
were part of the DM trial, which excluded women with fat intake
of <32% of kcal at baseline, the measure of % energy from fat (a
component of the DII) calculated from the baseline FFQ, was
upwardly biased due to regression to the mean; lowering fat
intake was a goal of the intervention group,(43) and women
eligible for entry into the DM had reported energy intake values
that were 160 kcal/day lower than expected energy intake values
when compared to ineligible women (ie, those reporting >32%
calories as fat).(44) Thus, we conducted sensitivity analyses
excluding women in the treatment arm of the DM trial. Also, the
DII did not include calcium, a key nutrient in bone health,
therefore we adjusted for calcium in statistical models. Finally, no
data were available for some specific dietary supplements that
may affect inflammation (eg, fish oil).
Conclusions
Postmenopausal women with a less inflammatory DII score had
lower hip BMD at baseline, but lost less BMD at the hip over
6 years compared to women consuming a more inflammatory
diet. Consuming a more inflammatory diet was associated with
increased risk of hip fracture in younger white women. Further
research is warranted to confirm these findings among more
diverse populations.
