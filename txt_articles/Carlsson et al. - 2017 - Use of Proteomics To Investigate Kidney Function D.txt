Abstract
Background and objectives Using a discovery/replication approach, we investigated associations between a
multiplex panel of 80 circulating proteins associated with cardiovascular pathology or inflammation, and eGFR
decline per year and CKD incidence.
Design, setting, participants, & measurements We used two cohorts, the Prospective Investigation of the
Vasculature in Uppsala Seniors Study (PIVUS; n=687, mean age of 70 years, 51% women) and the Uppsala
Longitudinal Study of Adult Men (ULSAM; n=360 men, mean age of 78 years), with 5-year follow-up data on
eGFR. There were 231 and 206 incident cases of CKD during follow-up in the PIVUS and ULSAM studies,
respectively.Proteomicprofilingof80 proteinswasassessedbyamultiplexassay(proximity extensionassay).The
assay uses two antibodies for each protein and a PCR step to achieve a high-specific binding and the possibility to
measure multiple proteins in parallel, but gives no absolute concentrations.
Results In the discovery cohort from the PIVUS Study, 28 plasma proteins were significantly associated with eGFR
decline per year, taking into account the multiple testing. Twenty of these proteins were significantly associated
with eGFR decline per year in the replication cohort from the ULSAM Study after adjustment for age, sex,
cardiovascular risk factors, medications, and urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (in order of significance:
TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptor 2*, CD40L receptor, TNF receptor 1*, placenta growth factor*,
thrombomodulin*, urokinase plasminogen activator surface receptor*, growth/differentiation factor 15*,
macrophage colony-stimulating factor 1, fatty acid-binding protein*, cathepsin D, resistin, kallikrein 11*, C-C
motif chemokine 3, proteinase-activated receptor 1*, cathepsin L, chitinase 3-like protein 1, TNF receptor 2*,
fibroblast growth factor 23*, monocyte chemotactic protein 1, and kallikrein 6). Moreover, 11 of the proteins
predicted CKD incidence (marked with * above). No protein consistently predicted eGFR decline per year
independently of baseline eGFR in both cohorts.
Conclusions Several circulating proteins involved in phosphate homeostasis, inflammation, apoptosis, extracellular
matrix remodeling, angiogenesis, and endothelial dysfunction were associated with worsening kidney function.
Multiplex proteomics appears to be a promising way of discovering novel aspects of kidney disease pathology.

Introduction
CKD affects 10% of the general population worldwide
(1), but the prevalence is expected to increase even
further given the ongoing obesity epidemic and the
growing elderly population (2). CKD has a substantial
effect on public health, as decline in eGFR is closely
associated with the risk of ESRD, cardiovascular disease
(CVD), and mortality (2–5). The complex underlying
pathophysiology leading to kidney disease is still not
completely understood and there is a need for specific,
sensitive, and clinically relevant kidney disease bio-
markers that may help to improve the identification of
individuals at high risk of CKD progression and its
consequences.
Advancement of technology that makes it possible
to simultaneously measure a large number of proteins
(6) provides new opportunities for unbiased discovery
of novel pathophysiologic pathways of disease, as
well as for the identification of novel disease bio-
markers. Yet the utility of proteomic profiling for the
development of kidney disease is less studied, and
previous studies have generally been performed in
small study samples of individuals with CKD or
diabetes (7–11). Importantly, community-based data
are lacking.
Therefore, we aimed to explore and validate the
associations between a multiplex assay panel of 92
plasma proteins involved in CVD pathology or in-
flammation with eGFR decline per year in two in-
dependent community-based cohorts of elderly
people. Given the close interplay between kidney
disease, inflammation, and CVD (12,13), we hypoth-
esized that this particular proteomics panel could be
relevant in this respect.

The Prospective Investigation of the Vasculature in Uppsala
Seniors Study
All 70-year-old men and women living in Uppsala, Sweden,
between the years 2001 and 2004 were eligible for the
Prospective Investigation of the Vasculature in Uppsala
Seniors (PIVUS) Study (described in detail at http://www.
medsci.uu.se/pivus/pivus.htm) (14). Of 2025 invited individ-
uals, 1016 agreed to participate. A second examination cycle
was performed between 2006 and 2009, when participants
were 75 years old. Of 964 invited participants, 827 participated
(86%). Of these, 687 individuals had valid measurements of
the proteomic assay, eGFR at baseline and at follow-up, and
covariates, and thus constitute the present sample.
The Uppsala Longitudinal Study of Adult Men
The Uppsala Longitudinal Study of Adult Men (ULSAM)
was initiated in 1970. All 50-year-old men born in 1920–24
and living in Uppsala, Sweden, were invited to participate
in a health survey, focusing on identifying cardiovascular
risk factors (described in detail at http://www.pubcare.uu.
se/ulsam/) (15). This study used the fourth examination
cycle as baseline, when participants were approximately
77 years old (1998–2001). Of 1398 invited men, 838 (60%)
participated, and data on the proteomics assay were avail-
able in 786 individuals. We used the fifth examination cy-
cle (2003–2005), when participants were approximately 82
years old, as a follow-up examination. To this examination,
952 men still living in Uppsala were invited and 530 men
(56%) participated. After exclusion of individuals without
data on covariates and eGFR at both examinations, the
present sample is comprised of 360 men.
All participants in the PIVUS and ULSAM studies gave
written informed consent and the Ethics Committee of Uppsala
University approved the study protocols. Both studies were
conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki.
Baseline and Follow-Up Investigations
The investigations in the PIVUS and ULSAM studies
were performed using similar standardized methods, in-
cluding anthropometrical measurements, BP, blood sam-
pling, and questionnaires regarding socioeconomic status,
medical history, smoking habits, medication, and physical
activity level (14,15). In both cohorts, venous blood samples
were drawn in the morning after an overnight fast and
stored at 270°C until analysis.
In the ULSAM Study, eGFR was analyzed from serum
cystatin C using latex-enhanced reagent (N Latex Cystatin
C; Dade Behring, Deerfield, IL) on a BN ProSpec analyzer
(Dade Behring), and in the PIVUS Study by an assay from
Gentian (Gentian, Moss, Norway). As the analyses of cystatin
C were performed before the development of the interna-
tional reference standard for cystatin C (16), we used eGFR
equations that were specifically developed for the particular
cystatin C assays at our laboratory (ULSAM Study:
eGFR=77.243cystatin C21z2623; PIVUS Study: eGFR=79.9013
cystatin C21.4389). Both formulae for eGFR are closely correlated
with iohexol clearance (17,18).
In the ULSAM Study, a 24-hour collection of urine was
made and stored at 270°C until analysis. No urine was
collected at baseline in the PIVUS Study. Urine albumin
was measured by nephelometry (Reagent OSAL15 and
OUMS65; Dade Behring, Deerfield, IL) using a BN ProSpec
analyzer (Dade Behring). Urinary creatinine was analyzed
with a modified kinetic Jaffe reaction on an Architect
Ci8200 analyzer (Reagent 3L81; Abbott, Abbot Park, IL)
and urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio was calculated.
Diabetes mellitus was diagnosed as fasting plasma
glucose $7.0 mmol/L ($126 mg/dl) or use of antidiabetic
medication (19).
The Proseek Multiplex Panel
The Olink Proseek Multiplex Cardiovascular 1 96396 kit
was used to measure proteins in plasma by real-time PCR
using the Fluidigm BioMark HD real-time PCR platform,
as described previously (6,20). Of the 96 wells, one is a
negative control and three are positive controls (spiked in
IL-6, IL-8, and VEGF-A), resulting in 92 measured proteins.
Each sample includes two incubations, one extension, and
one detection control used to determine the lower detection
limit and normalize the measurements. The resulting
relative values obtained are log2-transformed for subse-
quent analysis. Twelve proteins where ,85% of the individuals
had a valid measurement of that protein were removed
from further analysis (Supplemental Table 1), Hence, 80
proteins were included in the statistical analysis. Individ-
uals with excess missing protein data were also excluded
(.5% and .3% in the PIVUS and ULSAM studies, re-
spectively). Values below the lower limit of detection (LOD)
were replaced with LOD/2. Each protein was normalized
by plate (by setting the mean=0 and SD=1 within each plate)
and storage time (correction on the basis of the observed
values and predicted values from a spline model). In a
previous validation study of the proteomics assay that
included 90 proteins and seven samples analyzed, the mean
intra-assay coefficient of variation was found to be 8% and
the mean interassay coefficient of variation was 12% (6). A
more detailed information on the coefficients of variation of
specific proteins can be found on the Olink website (www.
olink.com).
We used the Protein Annotation Through Evolutionary
Relationship Pathways annotation data set and literature
review to find common biologic processes between the
replicated proteins (21).
Outcomes
Data on eGFR was available both at baseline and at a
reinvestigation after approximately 5 years in both cohorts.
eGFR decline per year was calculated and used as the
primary end point. Incident CKD was defined as having
eGFR,60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 at the follow-up investigation
in those with eGFR$60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 at baseline.
Statistical Analyses
For the primary analysis, the PIVUS Study was used as
the discovery cohort and the ULSAM Study was used for
replication (22). For discovery, the association between
each of the proteins and eGFR decline per year was
investigated using multivariable linear regression models
adjusting for age, sex, LDL and HDL cholesterol, lipid-
lowering treatment, systolic BP, specified antihypertensive
drug classes (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors,
angiotensin receptor blockers, b-blockers, calcium antago-
nists, and diuretics [mainly thiazides]), body mass index,

 fasting glucose, oral antidiabetic treatment, insulin treatment,
and smoking, all assessed at baseline. We chose this approach
as we primarily wanted to identify proteins that were
associated with eGFR decline independently of established
risk factors for cardiovascular or kidney disease. The proteins
showing a false discovery rate ,0.05 were taken further to
linear regression analyses in the ULSAM Study replication
cohort. In the replication step, baseline urinary albumin-to-
creatinine ratio was also added to the multivariable model. A
nominal P value of ,0.05 for the multivariate-adjusted anal-
ysis was considered statistically significant for the analyses in
the ULSAM Study replication cohort.
Secondary Analyses
In secondary analyses, we added baseline eGFR to the
aforementioned multivariable models. We performed sub-
group analyses in participants without diabetes at baseline
(n=613 for the PIVUS Study and n=320 for the ULSAM
Study). We also investigated the association between the
proteins that were replicated and incident CKD in partic-
ipants with eGFR.60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 at baseline
(n=660 for the PIVUS Study and n=319 for the ULSAM
Study). Finally, we investigated the cross-sectional associ-
ation between the proteins and baseline eGFR in both cohorts.
STATA version 14 was used for calculations (StataCorp.,
College Station, TX).
Results
Baseline characteristics for the covariate factors in the
PIVUS and ULSAM studies are shown in Table 1.
eGFR Decline per Year in the PIVUS Study: Discovery
The multivariate b coefficients and P values for the linear
association between all proteins and eGFR decline per year
in the PIVUS Study are shown in Figure 1. A total of 28
proteins were significantly associated with eGFR decline
per year when using a false discovery rate of 5% (Figure 1).
eGFR Decline per Year in the ULSAM Study: Replication
In the ULSAM Study replication cohort, 20 of these
proteins were significantly associated with eGFR decline
per year (Figure 2A, Table 2).
When excluding participants with a diabetes diagnosis at
baseline, the associations were similar, except for chitinase
3-like protein 1, which was found to be of borderline
significance in the ULSAM Study (P=0.07; Figure 2B).

 CKD Incidence in the PIVUS and ULSAM Studies. In
the subset free from CKD at baseline, 231 of 660 participants in
the PIVUS Study and 206 of 319 participants in the ULSAM
Study developed incident CKD at follow-up. Eleven of the
abovementioned 20 proteins consistently predicted incident
CKD in subgroup analyses in those with eGFR.60 ml/min
per 1.73 m2 at baseline in both cohorts (Figure 3, Table 2).
Cross-Sectional Analyses
Please see Supplemental Tables 2 and 3 for the cross-
sectional association between the proteins and baseline
eGFR in both cohorts. With the exception of a nonsignif-
icant association between cathepsin L and baseline eGFR in
the PIVUS Study, higher levels of 19 of the 20 above-
mentioned proteins were associated with lower baseline
GFR in both cohorts in cross-sectional multivariable linear
regression analyses. Moreover, a total of 60 proteins in the
PIVUS Study and 58 proteins in the ULSAM Study were
significantly associated with baseline eGFR.
Discussion
Principal Findings
Using a multiplex proteomics assay primarily designed
to be relevant for CVD pathology and inflammation, we
discovered and replicated independent associations

 between 20 circulating proteins with kidney function
decline (Table 2). These associations were generally
robust in individuals without diabetes. More than half
of the proteins also predicted incident CKD, suggesting
that pathways that are generally considered to be im-
portant primarily in the later stages of CKD, such as a
disturbed phosphate homeostasis or apoptosis, are also
involved in the early stages of progressive kidney
disease. An impaired phosphate homeostasis appeared
to be a particularly important common pathway for the
proteins associated with kidney function decline because
half of the proteins were involved in this pathway, according
to the functional analyses of our findings. Of all of the individ-
ual proteins, TRAIL-R2 was most strongly associated with
eGFR decline per year.
Comparison with Other Studies
Prior studies trying to identify novel kidney disease
biomarkers have generally been experimental colocaliza-
tion studies or animal studies (23–26), but in recent years
there have also emerged some promising data suggesting
that a panel of 273 urinary proteins (CKD273) could
improve the prediction of kidney function decline and
CKD progression (7,8,10,11). Studies evaluating the asso-
ciation between circulating proteomics and kidney function
decline are more rare. A recent nested case-control study in
patients with diabetes reported that a panel of 14 serum
biomarkers substantially increased the discrimination of
individuals with a rapid decline in eGFR from those with a
stable eGFR (9). It should be noted that most prospective
proteomics studies conducted so far have had small to

1231
 moderate sample sizes, and have lacked external validation
(27). Importantly, we are aware of no previous studies
reporting the association between circulating proteomics
and kidney function decline in the general population.
However, some of the individual proteins that we in-
vestigated in this study have previously been shown to be
associated with eGFR decline: U-PAR (28), GDF-15 (29),
CD40L (30), PlGF (29), RETN (31), sTNFR1 and sTNFR2
(32,33), and mixed results have been reported for FGF-23
(34,35). For the remaining 12 proteins, including TRAIL-R2,
we have not been able to find previous longitudinal stud-
ies investigating the association between plasma levels of
these proteins and kidney function decline, emphasizing
the potential utility of circulating multiplex proteomics for
biomarker discovery in kidney disease.
Potential Mechanisms Explaining Our Main Findings
The 20 proteins share several common biologic pathways
that are important for the progression of kidney disease:
phosphate homeostasis (FGF-23, PAR-1, FABP4, CD40L, U-
PAR, CCL3, sTNFR1, sTNFR2, CHI3L1, and GDF-15),
inflammation (sTNFR1, sTNFR2, U-PAR, hK11, CD40L,
FGF-23, GDF-15, CSF-1, CCL3, CHI3L1, and MCP-1),
apoptosis (TRAIL-R2, GDF-15, sTNFR1, sTNFR2, U-PAR,
PAR-1, CD40L, and CCL3), proteolysis and extracellular
matrix remodeling (U-PAR, CTSD, CTSL, CHI3L1, hK11,
and KLK6), angiogenesis (PlGF, CTSD, and CHI3L1), endo-
thelial function (PlGF, GDF-15, and PAR-1), and thrombosis
(TM, PAR-1, and CD40L).
Specific effects of individual proteins, such as fatty acid
transport (FABP4), lipoprotein formation (RETN), or anti-
gen presentation (CD40L), could also provide explanations
for these associations.
In addition to the aforementioned mechanisms of the
different proteins, many may have pleiotropic effects and
there could also be kidney-specific mechanisms that are not
yet identified. Further experimental studies are warranted
to explain the role of the proteins in kidney disease
progression. Our data provide a basis that may help guide
future directions of such experimental research.
For TRAIL-R2, there are some mechanisms that may
explain why it was the protein that was most closely
associated with eGFR decline. TRAIL-R2 is expressed in
many tissues in the body, including in convoluted tubules
and in the loop of Henle, but not in the glomeruli or in renal
vasculature (36). The overall main function of TRAIL-R2 is
to penetrate cell membranes and to induce an intracellular
reaction leading to apoptotic cell death. The TRAIL-
induced cell death could play an important role in the
progression of diabetic nephropathy (37). Renal TRAIL
expression has been shown to be consistently higher in
animals with diabetes than in those without (36), and
circulating TRAIL levels have also been shown to be higher
in patients with diabetes and albuminuria than in patients
with normoalbuminuria (38). TRAIL has also been sug-
gested to be involved in tubular and glomerular injury and
its expression to be induced after exposure to toxic metals
(36). The TRAIL-R2 receptor is activated by TRAIL, and
in a previous study in patients with CKD, lower levels
of soluble TRAIL were associated with worsening CKD
categories in cross-sectional analyses (39). Our data confirm
and extend the notion that the interplay between TRAIL
and its receptors is an important factor contributing to
kidney disease progression.
There are several common underlying risk factors in the
development of kidney disease and CVD (12), such as
diabetes (40), hypertension (41), dyslipidemia (42), in-
flammation (42), and albuminuria (42). However, the fact
that the association between the proteins and eGFR
decline was independent of all aforementioned risk
factors suggests that these are not major mediators of
the present associations.

 Clinical Implications
Since the 1990s, the global number of deaths due to
CKD has almost doubled (43), and the incidence and
prevalence of CKD is expected to increase even further. In
this moving landscape, an improved understanding of
the underlying causes of CKD and the identification of
high-risk individuals for CKD progression will be in-
creasingly important. Although 20 proteins were identi-
fied as potential risk markers in this study, none of them
were consistently associated with eGFR decline after
taking into account the baseline eGFR. From a mecha-
nistic viewpoint, adjustment for baseline eGFR may not
necessarily be appropriate because lower baseline eGFR
could be regarded as an intermediate state along the
causal pathway for further eGFR decline, and conse-
quently constitutes an overadjustment that hides true
associations. The strong cross-sectional associations be-
tween the proteins and baseline eGFR support this
notion. However, from a clinical perspective, it is essen-
tial that a novel kidney disease biomarker provides

 prognostic information on CKD progression beyond the
baseline eGFR. Thus, our proteomic profiling did not identify
a promising biomarker that seems to have clinical utility
for risk prediction purposes.
Strengths and Limitations
Strengths of our investigation include the longitudi-
nal study design and the replication of findings in an
independent cohort. Limitations include the unknown
generalizability to other age and ethnic groups, and that
there may be healthy cohort effects at play in population-
based invited investigations of elderly individuals. The
healthy cohort effects may be of particular importance in
this study, given that only those surviving 5 years or
more could be included. It is reasonable to assume that
those with the most rapid decline in eGFR did not attend
the re-examination to the same extent as those with a
more stable eGFR. Another limitation is the fact that
our study used single assessments of eGFR and the
proteomic assay. However, the potential misclassifica-
tion because of short-term variability would likely only
result in more conservative estimates. Limitations of the
proteomics assay include that no absolute levels of the
proteins are obtained, which makes comparisons be-
tween studies or defining relevant cut-off limits difficult,
and that the selection process of proteins on the assay
was on the basis of both the availability of high-quality
antibodies and the limits of what range of concentrations
could be measured using the same assay. Moreover, the
coefficients of variation of the proteomics assay were on
the basis of data from a previous publication (6) and on
information provided by the manufacturer Olink (www.
olink.com). Thus, the performance of the proteomics
assay in the clinical practice setting warrants further
study.
Conclusions
The vast number of proteins independently associated
with decline in kidney function show CKD to be a multifac-
torial and highly complex disease, involving an impaired
phosphate homeostasis, inflammation, apoptosis, increased
extracellular matrix remodeling, a disturbed angiogene-
sis, and endothelial dysfunction. The strongest associa-
tion was found for TRAIL-R2, a protein that has not been
associated with eGFR decline previously. Multiplex pro-
teomics appears to be a promising way of discovering novel
aspects of kidney disease pathology. Additional studies are
needed to identify kidney disease biomarkers with potential
for clinical utility.
