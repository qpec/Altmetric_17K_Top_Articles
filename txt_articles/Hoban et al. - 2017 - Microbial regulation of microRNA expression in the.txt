Abstract
Background: There is growing evidence for a role of the gut microbiome in shaping behaviour relevant to many
psychiatric and neurological disorders. Preclinical studies using germ-free (GF) animals have been essential in
contributing to our current understanding of the potential importance of the host microbiome for neurodevelopment
and behaviour. In particular, it has been repeatedly demonstrated that manipulation of the gut microbiome modulates
anxiety-like behaviours. The neural circuits that underlie anxiety- and fear-related behaviours are complex and heavily
depend on functional communication between the amygdala and prefrontal cortex (PFC). Previously, we have shown
that the transcriptional networks within the amygdala and PFC of GF mice are altered. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) act
through translational repression to control gene translation and have also been implicated in anxiety-like behaviours.
However, it is unknown whether these features of host post-transcriptional machinery are also recruited by the gut
microbiome to exert control over CNS transcriptional networks.
Results: We conducted Illumina® next-generation sequencing (NGS) in the amygdala and PFC of conventional, GF and
germ-free colonized mice (exGF). We found a large proportion of miRNAs to be dysregulated in GF animals in both
brain regions (103 in the amygdala and 31 in the PFC). Additionally, colonization of GF mice normalized some of the
noted alterations. Next, we used a complementary approach to GF by manipulating the adult rat microbiome with an
antibiotic cocktail to deplete the gut microbiota and found that this strategy also impacted the expression of relevant
miRNAs.
Conclusion: These results suggest that the microbiome is necessary for appropriate regulation of miRNA expression in
brain regions implicated in anxiety-like behaviours.

Background
One of the most exciting findings in the past decade in
relation to psychiatric disorders has been the discovery
that the gut microbiota may act as a key regulator of the
brain and behaviour [1–3]. Proof-of-principal experi-
ments using microbiota-deficient or germ-free (GF)
rodents have been extremely useful in investigating the
impact of the absence of the gut microbiota on brain
development and behaviour [4], especially regarding the
ability of the gut microbiota to influence normal anxiety
and fear behaviours [5–7]. GF animals not only display
changes in basal anxiety but also have deficits in soci-
ability, cognition and increased depressive-like behav-
iours [8–10]. Some studies that use antibiotic exposure
in order to deplete the gut microbiota have also shown
similarly altered behavioural phenotypes [11–13]. Pre-
clinical evidence also highlights that certain probiotics
and prebiotics have anxiolytic-like activity [14, 15] which
highlights the potential of microbiota-mediated thera-
peutic approaches for treating anxiety-related disorders.

ioural effects in rodent models of microbial disturbances

 is a marked influence on anxiety-related behaviours [4].
The neural systems that govern such behaviours are
complex, with an array of brain regions that intercon-
nect in order to process emotional stimuli and allow
for appropriate responses [16]. Specifically, the amyg-
dala and PFC are key loci that control anxiety and
the response to fearful stimuli [17]. Both regions dis-
play abnormalities in GF animals including hypermye-
lination in the PFC [18], altered morphology of the
amygdala [19] and impaired amygdala-dependent fear
memory recall [7]. A large body of evidence impli-
cates dysfunction of the neural circuits connecting
these two brain regions in the pathophysiology of
fear- and anxiety-like disorders [20, 21].
Over the past few years, attempts to understand the
mechanisms underlying psychiatric disorders have fo-
cused attention on the role of miRNAs [22]. miRNAs
are an expanding class of endogenous small non-
coding RNAs, which function as post-transcriptional
regulators
of
gene
expression,
primarily
through
translational repression. It has been demonstrated that
brain-specific miRNA candidates within the amygdala
and PFC regulate anxiety- and fear-related behaviours
in mice [23–26].
We have previously shown that the absence of micro-
bial exposure throughout life results in altered transcrip-
tional regulation in both the amygdala and PFC [18, 27].
We therefore hypothesized that alterations in miRNA
expression may be associated with some of the noted
molecular changes in these animals. To this end, we
used a number of complementary approaches. Firstly,
we conducted unbiased Illumina® NGS for miRNAs in
the amygdala and PFC of conventionally raised (CON),
GF and colonized GF mice (exGF) to investigate whether
miRNA expression can be influenced by the gut micro-
biota. To delineate specific miRNAs that may be influ-
enced by the gut microbiota during adulthood following
normal assembly patterns in early life, we then examined
miRNA expression in the central nervous system (CNS)
of adult rodents following sustained microbiota knock-
down with antibiotics. We hypothesized that there
would be extensive reorganization of miRNA expression
in these two key brain regions (amygdala and PFC) of
microbiota-deficient rodents.
Methods
Experimental design
Illumina® NGS was conducted in GF mice to determine
whether the absence of microbes throughout life re-
sulted in altered miRNA expression in the amygdala and
PFC. Once validation of sequencing in GF animals was
carried out, we then examined whether these miRNAs
identified in GF mice were affected in other strategies
known to manipulate the gut microbiota. Microbiota
(bacteria)-deficient GF mice were compared to rodents,
the latter with their digestive tract/gut bacteria con-
trolled by antibiotics to delineate/validate common gut
bacteria that influence brain-specific miRNAs. The ra-
tionale for using this complementary approach to GF
was to ensure our findings were not species specific and
to thus identify a lead candidate miRNA under the influ-
ence of the gut microbiota in both mice and rats.
Animals
Germ free
Swiss Webster GF and CON breeding pairs were
obtained from Taconic (Germantown, NY, USA) with
F1-generation offspring used in all experiments. GF mice
were housed in gnotobiotic flexible-film isolators ran-
ging from two to four mice per cage kept on a strict 12-
h light/dark cycle. exGF mice were all initially raised
within the GF isolators until post-natal day 21 where
they were removed and housed in standard animal units
next to CON mice in order to allow for efficient
colonization by environmental microbes [28]. exGF mice
were initially put in cages with dirty bedding from CON;
as
mice
are
coprophagic,
this
allows
for
efficient
colonization [28]. CON mice were housed in controlled
conditions with regulated temperature (20–21 °C) and
humidity (55–60%) with two to four mice per cage on
the same 12-h light/dark cycle as GF mice. All mice,
CON, GF and exGF received the same autoclaved, pel-
leted diet (Special Diet Services, product code 801010).
All experiments were conducted in accordance with
European Directive 2010/63/EU. Approval by the Animal
Experimentation Ethics Committee of University College
Cork was obtained before commencement of all animal-
related experiments. Both the conventional and GF facil-
ities adhere to the same animal care guidelines in terms of
temperature, humidity and noise levels.
Antibiotic treatment
Adult male Sprague Dawley rats (n = 10/group) were
housed five per cage in standard rat cages in our animal
housing facility under a strict 12-h light/dark cycle. Both
antibiotic-treated and vehicle-treated rats received the
same autoclaved diet (Teklad Global 18% Protein Rodent
Diet, product code 2018S). To deplete the gut micro-
biota, rats were treated with a cocktail of antibiotics for
a total of 13 weeks; animals were 9 weeks old before
antibiotic exposure. The antibiotic cocktail consisted of
ampicillin (1 g/L), vancomycin (500 mg/L), ciprofloxacin
HCL (20 mg/L), imipenem (250 mg/L) and metrondia-
zole (1 g/L) in autoclaved water. This was changed every
3 days as previously described to deplete the gut bacteria
[29, 30]. Control animals received autoclaved water
without any antibiotics which was also changed every
3 days. Additional details on experimental design and

 neurochemical and behavioural consequences of chronic
gut microbiota depletion can be found in our previous
publication [30].
RNA extraction
The amygdala and PFC was dissected as previously described
[18, 27]. Following manufacturer’s protocol, a mirVana™
miRNA kit (Ambion/Life Technologies) was used to extract
total RNA from germ-free and antibiotic-treated ani-
mals. A NanoDrop 1000 (Thermo Scientific) and a
Bioanalyzer were used to determine concentration and
RNA integrity number (RIN). Only GF samples, con-
ventional and exGF animals were randomly pooled
within each group by combining equal amounts of
RNA from two to three animals resulting in a final
sample group of four. Experimental pooling for GF
samples was carried out according to a previously pub-
lished protocol [18].
MicroRNA sequencing
Library preparation and next-generation sequencing was
conducted on all samples. Two hundred nanograms of
total RNA was converted into miRNA NGS libraries
using NEBNEXT library generation kit (New England
Biolabs Inc.) according to manufacturer’s instructions.
Each individual RNA sample was converted to comple-
mentary DNA (cDNA) which was pre-amplified. After
15
cycles
pre-PCR,
the
libraries
were
purified
on
QiaQuick columns and the insert efficiency evaluated by
the Bioanalyzer 2100. Based on the quality of the inserts
and the concentration measurements, the libraries were
pooled. Library pools were quantified by qPCR and used
to generate clusters on the surface of a flowcell before
sequencing. A total of 12 samples were sent for Illumina®
NGS for miRNAs to Exiqon (Denmark) to determine
changes in miRNA expression profiles (GF study animals
only).
Annotation
of
the
obtained
sequences
was
performed using the reference annotation miRbase 20
(http://www.mirbase.org/). miRNA sequencing was per-
formed using the NextSeq500 with 50 bd single-end read
sequencing cycles. Expression levels of individual miR-
NAs are measured as tags per million (TPM).
cDNA synthesis and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR)
RNA was reverse transcribed using TaqMan® MicroRNA
Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems) for indi-
vidual miRNAs in a G-storm thermocycler (G-storm,
Surrey, UK). Using AB7300 system (Applied Biosystems)
and TaqMan Gene Expression Assays (Additional file 1:
Table S1) for individual miRNAs, expression levels were
determined within the amygdala and prefrontal cortex.
Each transcript value was averaged from triplicates per
experimental condition. All average values were normal-
ized to expression levels of the housekeeper gene U6, a
small nuclear RNA, for each experimental condition.
Fold change in gene expression was normalized against
expression levels in naïve CON mice. qRT-PCR valid-
ation was conducted on all individual samples used to
construct the pooled sequencing samples: germ-free
(n = 12/group) and antibiotic (n = 10/group).
mRNA target predictions
The miRwalk (http://zmf.umm.uni-heidelberg.de/apps/
zmf/mirwalk2/) prediction database was used to identify
predicted and validated targets for the miRNAs we
found significantly dysregulated due to absence of bac-
terial exposure (GF vs. CON). Using miRwalk, we listed
all predicted and validated messenger RNA (mRNA) tar-
gets for all differentially regulated miRNA in both the
amygdala and prefrontal cortex. We selected for miR-
walk to include predicted mRNA targets from four dif-
ferent prediction databases which included TargetSacn,
miRanda, miRDB and miRwalk. Criteria for prediction
included a minimal seed length of seven base pairs and a
P value < 0.05 was used as a cut-off. For further analysis,
we only chose predicted targets that occurred in three or
more prediction algorithms.
Functional classification of predicted miRNA targets
Predicted mRNA targets of differentially regulated miR-
NAs in GF mice compared to CON were analysed for
enrichment of Gene Ontology (GO) terms and Kyoto
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways
using the DAVID Bioinformatic Resources (v6.8). Lists
of predicted targets were generated for any miRNA that
fell under the selection criteria, and they were used to
determine functionally enriched pathways that these
miRNAs are predicted to be implicated in. FDR P ad-
justed value of 0.1 was used as the significance cut-off as
per previous publications [7, 18, 27].
mRNA interaction analysis
To find the correlation between differential expression
of miRNAs and their target mRNAs, a series of bioinfor-
matic analyses were performed. miRNAs are usually
negatively correlated with their targeted mRNAs, except
in some cases where translation might be enhanced [31].
In order to identify potential miRNA-regulated target
genes in GF mice, the datasets of differentially expressed
miRNA and mRNA transcripts from our previous publi-
cations [18, 27] were integrated. We set the following
criteria
for
potential
predicted
targets.
The
target
mRNAs and miRNAs should be simultaneously and re-
versely changed in our group comparisons. The target
mRNAs should be predicted by miRNA from at least
three different prediction software. The complement
miRNA targets predicted were compared with those
differentially regulated genes (DEGs) from our mRNA

 sequencing to detect overlap. For this analysis, we only
focused on interactions with validated miRNAs in the
amygdala. Since myelination was the strongest represen-
tation at the transcriptional level [18], we investigated
whether any down-regulated miRNAs in the PFC were
predicted to target upregulated myelin-related genes.
Statistics
NGS differential expression analysis used the EdgeR statis-
tical software package (Bioconductor, http://bioconductor.
org/). Differential expression analysis investigates the rela-
tive change in expression (i.e. counts) between different
samples. P values for significantly expressed miRNAs are
estimated by an exact test on the negative binomial distri-
bution. Data is presented with raw P value, Benjamini-
Hochberg FDR correction, and corrected P value as well as
the average read values per group (Additional file 2: Table
S2). For quantification via qRT-PCR, gene expression was
calculated using the 2−ΔΔCt formula [32]. This value was
then normalized to the control group to calculate fold
change. One-way ANOVA, or non-parametric equivalent
as appropriate, was used for gene expression analysis for
GF comparisons. Post hoc analysis was carried out using
Fisher’s Least Significant Difference (LSD) post hoc test.
For antibiotic treatment, a Student t test was carried out
between groups to determine significance. A P value < 0.05
was considered statistically significant.
Results
Altered miRNA expression profile in the amygdala and
prefrontal cortex of germ-free mice
We conducted unbiased Illumina® NGS for miRNAs on
extracted total RNA enriched for miRNA from the amyg-
dala and PFC of male CON mice, GF mice and exGF mice
(Fig. 1a). Initial analysis between CON and GF mice re-
vealed a large number of miRNAs in the amygdala that ap-
peared to have altered expression levels. In total, we found
that 103 (61 downregulated and 42 upregulated) miRNAs
showed changes with a P value of < 0.05 (Fig. 1b and
Additional file 3: Figure S1a, b). In the PFC, we also found
a number of differentially regulated miRNAs, though to a
lesser extent than in the amygdala. A total of 31 miRNAs
(21 downregulated, 10 upregulated) had altered expression
in the PFC (Fig. 1b, Additional file 3: Figure S1c, d). All
miRNAs differentially regulated in the amygdala and PFC
had a fold change higher than 1.2 and changes were found
across a large range of abundances (Log2 TPM) (Fig. 1c).
When GF mice were colonized (exGF), we found that a
proportion of differentially regulated miRNAs exhibited
normalized expression levels, similar to the CON group.
A total of 7 miRNAs in the amygdala and 8 miRNAs in
the PFC were significantly normalized when overlapping
their expression levels with CON vs GF comparison and
GF vs exGF (red circle) (Fig. 1d–f). When we overlapped
miRNAs that were normalized in both brain regions, we
found that miR-219a-2-3p was differentially regulated in
the amygdala and PFC of GF mice (Fig. 1f). Out of the
miRNAs that were commonly dysregulated in both re-
gions, miR-219a-2-3p, together with miR-190a-5p, was
oppositely regulated between both regions (decreased in
amygdala/increased in PFC) (Fig. 1g). Additional file 2:

 miRNAs that fulfilled specific criteria (Fig. 2a): high fold
change, highly expressed (based on TPM), normalized
by colonization, validated mRNA targets with associa-
tions in brain or behaviour research, and conservation
across rodents and humans (Additional file 4: Table S3).
We confirmed several miRNAs to be dysregulated in GF
mice as indicated by Illumina® sequencing in both the
amygdala and PFC (Fig. 2b–p). We demonstrated the
presence of miRNAs that had a large fold increase (miR-
3535, miR-673-5p) or decrease (miR-182-5p, miR-1964,
miR-206-3p), that were normalized
by colonization
(miR-219a-2-3p (PFC), miR-182-5p, miR-183-5p (amyg-
dala)) and that are known to be implicated in influencing
anxiety levels and expression of neurotrophins such as
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (miR-183-5p,
miR-206-3p) [33, 34].
Enrichment of predicted mRNA targets for all
differentially regulated miRNA suggests a role in
neurodevelopment
To elucidate the potential downstream gene networks
relevant in the amygdala and PFC that may be under the
influence of miRNAs in GF animals, we listed all potential
mRNA targets for individual miRNAs that were signifi-
cantly differentially regulated between CON and GF and
that had a PCR-detectable read count (TPM > 100) in
both brain regions (79 miRs in amygdala and 9 in PFC).
We listed all targets that appeared in more than 3 target-
prediction algorithms (miRWalk) and examined GO terms
and KEGG pathways. In the amygdala, we found an
enrichment in GO terms for neuronal development in-
cluding neurogenesis, neuron projection development,
differentiation and morphogenesis (Fig. 3c, highlighted).
KEGG pathway analysis of predicted mRNA targets fea-
tured enrichment for axon guidance, MAPK, oxytocin and
neurotrophic signalling pathways (Fig. 3d). While the indi-
vidual miRNAs were largely different, within the PFC
highly similar GO terms and KEGG pathways were noted
(Additional file 5: Figure S2a–c). In line with a higher
number of differentially expressed miRNAs in the amyg-
dala, several unique GO terms and pathways were found
enriched in this region, with only few pathways enriched
in a region-specific manner in the PFC (Additional file 5:
Figure S2C).
To further highlight the potential regulatory role of
these miRNAs at the transcriptional level, we listed all
predicted targets (< 3 prediction algorithms) of qRT-
PCR-validated miRNAs in the amygdala and overlapped
them with our previously published data on the amyg-
dala transcriptome of GF mice [27]. We found a pre-
dicted interaction with dysregulated miRNAs in the
amygdala that are predicted to target mRNA transcripts
that are also altered in GF mice (Additional file 6: Table
S4). Since hypermyelination was the strongest finding in
the PFC [18], we focused on miRNAs in the PFC that
are predicted to target myelin-related genes (Additional
file 7: Table S5).
Antibiotic exposure alters expression of miRNAs in the
amygdala and PFC in rats
Antibiotic exposure is a useful strategy for directly de-
pleting the gut microbiota in rodents [11, 13]. We inves-
tigated whether miRNAs that were dysregulated in GF
mice had altered expression after antibiotic exposure.
We found a number of miRNAs to be altered in the
amygdala and PFC of rats after chronic long-term anti-
biotic exposure. Specifically, in line with the data from
GF mice, we found a significant decrease in miR-206-3p
and miR-219a-2-3p and an increase in miR-369-3p in
the amygdala of rats exposed to antibiotics (Fig. 4b–d).
Within the PFC of antibiotic-treated rats, we again

 found a significant decrease in the expression of miR-
219a-5p (Fig. 4k), another miRNA found to be differen-
tially expressed in our GF mice; however, the direction
of the change was opposite. Other miRNAs that were
reported and validated to be altered in GF mice were
investigated but did not change following antibiotic
exposure in adulthood (Fig. 4e–j, l–m).
Discussion
A large body of preclinical literature highlights host-
microbe interactions as a key factor in the modulation of
specific brain networks related to a range of psychiatric
disorders [2, 35]. Specifically, using GF animals, many
studies have illustrated the critical role of a functional
host microbiome in the normal expression of anxiety-,
social-, fear- and depressive-like behaviours in these ro-
dents [6, 9, 10, 36] (Additional file 8: Figure S3). Our
findings indicated that two brain regions, the PFC and
amygdala, known to govern the expression of fear, anx-
iety and social behaviours, display a large dysregulated
network of miRNA expression, which may ultimately
contribute to the observed behavioural changes associ-
ated with GF mice. We have also shown that exGF mice
show an alteration in expression of miRNAs. Comple-
mentary approaches using antibiotics offer converging
evidence for microbial regulation of miRNA expression.
To our knowledge, this is the first time that the gut
microbiome has been implicated in miRNA expression
in the amygdala and PFC.
Many studies have shown that when GF animals are
exposed to microbes early in life, between post-natal
weeks 3–6, some of the observed differences can be
reversed or partially reversed [6, 8, 37, 38] (Additional
file 3: Figure S3). Here, when we allowed for colonization
of our GF animals in a conventional facility from post-
natal day 21, we found a proportion of miRNAs to have
normalized expression levels. Additionally, we found that
the majority of differentially regulated miRNAs between
CON and GF mice showed regional specificity. These re-
sults suggest that targeting the microbiota later in life can
have an effect on miRNA expression in the CNS in a brain
region-specific manner. We also noted a large number of
miRNAs that remained altered following post-weaning
exposure to microbes. This supports the concept of crit-
ical neurodevelopmental windows during which the gut
microbiota is essential in influencing brain development
[39]. Previous studies have highlighted that colonization
of GF mice with a conventional or reduced microbiota, or
by mono-association with just one specific bacterial strain,
had the capacity to reverse increased adrenocorticotropic
hormone (ACTH) levels after acute stress [37], increased
tryptophan levels, reduced basal anxiety [6] and altered
social behaviour [8]. It is tempting to speculate that the
subset of miRNAs identified that are normalized by
colonization
may
contribute
to
the
well-established
phenotype of GF mice as they show dynamic expression,
dependent on the presence or absence of a functional
microbiome. However, a recent study investigating the
changes in hippocampal miRNAs using a hybridized
microarray approach in GF and colonized GF mice after
weaning showed normalization of seven miRNAs with no
restoration of behavioural changes in the open field test
[40]. Similarly, we see partial reversibility in miRNAs
within the amygdala and PFC but the majority remain al-
tered in our exGF mice. A recent study has demonstrated
that colonization of GF mice partially restores impaired
amygdala-dependent fear memory recall in GF mice [7].
This partial recovery along with normalization of changes
in miRNAs may aid in identification of microbially regu-
lated brain-specific miRNAs. Further studies should con-
tinue to investigate more precise behavioural tests that
better correlate with specific brain regions.

 Within the amygdala, we found that miR-183-5p and
miR-182-5p were both decreased and subsequently nor-
malized by colonization. Both of these miRNAs have
been previously linked to amygdala-dependent stress-
and fear-related outputs [23, 41]. Specifically, miR-183
has been linked to regulating anxiety-related behaviours
in the Indian field mouse through influencing acetyl-
cholinesterase splicing [33]. This is also in line with the
fact that GF rodents have been shown to display altered
basal anxiety levels under naïve conditions and hyperse-
cretion of corticosterone (CORT) under acute stress
[37]. Clinically, miR-183 has been shown to be upregu-
lated in whole blood samples from depressed patients on
antidepressant treatment [42], highlighting that miR-183
is highly responsive to emotional stimuli. Within the lat-
eral amygdala, miR-182 appears to be essential for long-
term amygdala-dependent memory formation assessed
by auditory fear conditioning [23]. Recently, it has been
revealed that GF animals have impaired fear memory
recall [7]. Future studies may aim to manipulate the
expression of miRNAs such as miR-182 in order to
normalize
the
amygdala-dependent
memory
impair-
ments in these mice.
The GF model has many strengths; however, it has
limitations in regard to investigating the impact of al-
tered gut microbiota later in life [4, 43–45]. Here, we
further validated the lead candidate miRNAs identified
in GF mice by following alternative microbiota manipu-
lation strategy in a different species. We used brain tis-
sue from a separate cohort of rats exposed to antibiotics
during adulthood following normal development of the
gut microbiota prior to weaning [30]. Behavioural assess-
ment of these rodents post microbiota depletion showed
impairments in cognition and induced depressive-like
behaviours [30]. We found that alterations in miR-219a-
2-3p expression in both the amygdala and PFC was a
common feature of both GF status and animals rendered
microbiota-deficient post-weaning by antibiotic expos-
ure. Sequencing-based studies have found miR-219a-2-
3p/miR-219-3p to be altered in the basolateral amygdala
following social defeat [46]. Thus, even when the gut
microbiota is present during early life, subsequent deple-
tion via antibiotics still indicates a role of gut microbiota
in miRNA regulation. Whether gut microbiota-directed
interventions that produce more qualitative differences
in the microbiome also differentially regulate miRNAs is
an open question. Colonization of microbiota-deficient
rodents with the microbiota from mice with different
behavioural phenotypes, as described by Bercik et al., or
incremental antibiotic doses, would also provide valuable
insights [47]. Additionally, direct strain comparison be-
tween GF and antibiotic-treated mice may better reveal
brain-specific miRNAs sensitive to changes in the gut
microbiota.
Both strategies employed in our study to investigate
the effect of the gut microbiota on miRNA expression
implicated miR-206-3p as a target of the gut microbiota,
which was decreased under both conditions (Figs. 2g
and 4b). This particular miRNA is well validated in re-
gard to its role in the regulation of BDNF, an essential
neurotrophin, which promotes growth and development
of new neurons, survival of existing ones, and has an
essential role in synaptic plasticity [48]. Altered BDNF ex-
pression is a hallmark of a disturbed microbiota-gut-brain
axis, and it has been repeatedly shown to be altered in GF
and antibiotic-treated rodents [18, 27, 49, 50]. BDNF
mRNAs are proposed to contain conserved binding sites
for at least 14 different miRNA families with many pre-
dicted interactions validated in vivo [51]. Specifically, miR-
206-3p has been implicated in regulating the levels of
BDNF in different animal models of neurological disorders
[51, 52]. We have previously shown that there is a signifi-
cant increase in the mRNA levels of a specific BDNF tran-
script [27] in the amygdala, consistent with the finding
that miR-206-3p is significantly downregulated in this
region in the current study. Additionally, a decrease in
miR-206-3p in our antibiotic-treated rats coincided with a
decrease in BDNF mRNA [30]. Previous work has re-
vealed that targeting BDNF signalling by miRNAs has
therapeutic potential in neurodegenerative and psychiatric
diseases [48]. Thus, BDNF levels may be regulated by
microbiota-induced alterations in miRNA expression and
thus holds potential for a new treatment strategy in many
CNS-related disorders.
Our analysis of predicted mRNA targets reveals KEGG
pathways enriched for neurotrophin signalling along
with a prominent representation of targets enriched in
GO terms for nervous system development, neurogen-
esis, neuronal development and differentiation. miRNA
dysregulation and/or dysfunction are believed to be
underlying factors contributing to neurodegenerative
diseases and neurodevelopmental abnormalities [53]. In
fact, GF status results in altered stress circuitry along
with several well-documented behavioural alterations,
cognitive impairment, impaired microglial activation and
abnormally altered myelination [4]. A recent study in GF

 mice demonstrated that within the amygdala, there is
significant volumetric expansion within the lateral, baso-
lateral and medial nucleus when compared to CON mice
[19]. Coinciding with this, GF mice display hypertrophy
of aspiny interneurons and pyramidal neurons along
with changes in spine density [19].
Whether this change in gross morphology of the
amygdala in adulthood is related to the large change in
miRNAs remains to be determined. However, linking
changes in miRNAs to changes in amygdala volume has
been demonstrated in a rat model of autism using val-
proic acid. Administration of valproic acid coincides
with an enlarged amygdala and increased miR-30d and
miR-181c (~ 1.2 fold increase). Functional enrichment of
predicted targets of both miRNAs indicates enrichment
in GO terms for tissue morphology, nervous system
development and cellular development, which was con-
firmed by in vitro inhibition of miR-181c [54]. We also
see a trend towards a significant increase in miR-181c-
5p (1.4 fold increase) in our sequencing data (Additional
file 1: Table S1), which may be contributing to the gross
morphological changes seen in GF mice.
The exact mechanism through which the gut microbiota
can influence the expression of non-coding RNAs such as
miRNAs remains unclear. Currently, most evidence sup-
ports signalling through the vagus nerve [14, 55] and bac-
terial metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs),
which indirectly affect the nervous system through their
immunomodulatory functions [56, 57]. Recently, a study
investigating the impact of the gut microbiota on myelin-
ation demonstrated that certain bacterial metabolites in
vitro can impair oligodendrocyte differentiation [58].
Conclusion
In conclusion, the present study indicates that appropriate
regulation of miRNA expression within the amygdala and
PFC is influenced by microbiota composition and activity
and relies on the presence of a functional microbiota
during critical windows of neurodevelopment. In-depth
analysis of mRNA targets predicted to be under the influ-
ence of noted dysregulated miRNAs further suggests these
miRNAs may be implicated in neuronal development,
neurogenesis and appropriate BDNF signalling, all of which
have been shown to be altered in GF mice. Our results fur-
ther highlight that even following normal gut microbiome
development, subsequent knockdown with antibiotics also
impacts CNS miRNA expression and that such effects
generalize to another species (rat). The information gar-
nered from these two commonly applied strategies particu-
larly highlight miR-206-3p, a well-characterized miRNA
that is essential in the regulation of BDNF. Further mono-
association studies may elucidate specific bacterial strains
that mediate the influence over miRNAs, which would
considerably aid our efforts to fully delineate how certain
bacteria influence CNS function. miRNA-based therapeu-
tics for fear and anxiety disorders face a number of obsta-
cles relating to the availability of safe compounds that are
able to cross the blood-brain barrier and target relevant cell
populations and neurocircuitry [59]. Coupled with the
recent data supporting a role for the microbiota in
amygdala-dependent fear recall, the possibility of achieving
the desired impact on miRNA expression in specific brain
regions by targeting the gut microbiota is an appealing pro-
spect. This may expedite the promise apparent in these
two previously disparate approaches.
