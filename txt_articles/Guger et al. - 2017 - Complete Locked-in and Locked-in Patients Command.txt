Many patients with locked-in syndrome (LIS) or complete locked-in syndrome (CLIS)
also need brain-computer interface (BCI) platforms that do not rely on visual stimuli and
are easy to use. We investigate command following and communication functions of
mindBEAGLE with 9 LIS, 3 CLIS patients and three healthy controls. This tests were done
with vibro-tactile stimulation with 2 or 3 stimulators (VT2 and VT3 mode) and with motor
imagery (MI) paradigms. In VT2 the stimulators are fixed on the left and right wrist and the
participant has the task to count the stimuli on the target hand in order to elicit a P300
response. In VT3 mode an additional stimulator is placed as a distractor on the shoulder
and the participant is counting stimuli either on the right or left hand. In motor imagery
mode the participant is instructed to imagine left or right hand movement. VT3 and MI
also allow the participant to answer yes and no questions. Healthy controls achieved a
mean assessment accuracy of 100% in VT2, 93% in VT3, and 73% in MI modes. They
were able to communicate with VT3 (86.7%) and MI (83.3%) after 2 training runs. The
patients achieved a mean accuracy of 76.6% in VT2, 63.1% in VT3, and 58.2% in MI
modes after 1–2 training runs. 9 out of 12 LIS patients could communicate by using the
vibro-tactile P300 paradigms (answered on average 8 out of 10 questions correctly) and
3 out of 12 could communicate with the motor imagery paradigm (answered correctly 4,7
out of 5 questions). 2 out of the 3 CLIS patients could use the system to communicate
with VT3 (90 and 70% accuracy). The results show that paradigms based on non-visual
evoked potentials and motor imagery can be effective for these users. It is also the first
study that showed EEG-based BCI communication with CLIS patients and was able to
bring 9 out of 12 patients to communicate with higher accuracies than reported before.
More importantly this was achieved within less than 15–20 min.

INTRODUCTION
The left panel of Figure 1 categorizes different types of persons
based on their available cognitive and motor functions. Coma
patients do not exhibit cognitive or motor functions, and patients
in the unresponsive wakefulness state (UWS) presumably
have very limited or no motor and cognitive functions.
Minimal consciousness (MCS) patients also do not have reliable
voluntary motor control, and seem to have substantial cognitive
impairment, although their cognitive function may fluctuate.
These three types of patients are typically categorized as
having a disorder of consciousness (DOC). Locked-in (LIS)
and completely locked-in (CLIS) patients show limited or no
motor response, and assessing cognitive function can thus also
be difficult. LIS describes a clinical status of quadriplegia and
anarthria, with preserved eye gaze movements. In CLIS, there is
also oculomotor impairment and no communication is possible
by any mean. LIS and CLIS patients may have healthy cognitive
function, or may exhibit substantial impairment (Kübler et al.,
2001).
To investigate remaining cognitive functions in patients with
DOC, experts rely primarily on tests that require voluntary
motor control, such as the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) or
the Coma Recovery Scale—Revised (CRS-R) (Monti et al.,
2010; Giacino et al., 2012; Risetti et al., 2013; Gibson et al.,
2014). However, recent work has capitalized on brain-computer
interface (BCI) systems, which typically provide communication
or device control via direct measures of brain activity (Wolpaw
et al., 2002; Wolpaw and Wolpaw, 2012). Since EEG BCIs can
assess mental activity and even enable communication without
requiring movement, some groups have extended EEG BCIs to
assessment and communication for persons with DOC (Risetti
et al., 2013; Guger et al., 2016b; Ortner et al., in press). The
EEG-based mindBEAGLE BCI system was recently developed to
provide a convenient, fast, and practical platform for cognitive
assessment of command following and communication system
for such patients (Ortner et al., 2013, in press; Guger et al.,
2016b). This system relies on P300 and motor imagery BCIs
and a step-by-step explanation is given in (Ortner et al.,
in press).
EEG-based BCIs can utilize different approaches, such as:
(i) transient evoked potentials (like the N200 or P300) (Guger
et al., 2009, 2016a; Lugo et al., 2014), (ii) steady-state evoked
potentials (visual or somatosensory) (Bin et al., 2009; Ahn et al.,
2016), or (iii) motor imagery (Guger et al., 2003; Acqualagna
et al., 2016). P300 BCIs are often used for spelling applications,
and were tested with LIS patients in several studies (Fazel-Rezai
et al., 2012). These systems typically flash different characters
on the screen. By silently counting each time a target character
flashes, users can produce a P300 to target flashes only, and
the BCI can use this signal to infer user intent. Group studies
showed classification accuracies of about 90% for 81 subjects
with a black and white speller, and the newer face speller
has led to accuracy as high as 100% for 17 subjects (Guger
et al., 2009, 2016a; Kaufmann et al., 2011). P300 BCIs based on
auditory (Risetti et al., 2013; Rutkowski, 2016) or vibrotactile
stimuli have also been validated (Lugo et al., 2014; Gibson
et al., 2016). Both auditory and vibrotactile P300 BCIs typically
have a smaller vocabulary and lower accuracy than their visual
counterparts. However, they can help patients who cannot see,
and vibrotactile BCIs can be used in loud environments. In
previous work using vibrotactile P300 BCIs for LIS patients, 6
LIS patients attained a mean accuracy of 80% in a paradigm
with 2 tactile stimulators (left and right hand) and 55.3% in a
paradigm with 3 tactile stimulators (left and right hand, neck).
In both paradigms, chance accuracy was 12.5%, and the results
were statistically significant (Lugo et al., 2014). Recently also a
system using functional near infrared spectroscopy was used for
communication with CLIS patients and patients entering CLIS in
more than 40 sessions (Chaudhary et al., 2017). Up to now EEG-
based communication with CLIS was not shown (Chaudhary
et al., 2017).
Motor imagery BCIs usually instruct the user to imagine a
left hand or right hand movement to produce event-related (de-
)synchronization (ERD/S) in the alpha and beta frequency ranges
over the sensorimotor cortex (Guger et al., 2003; Pfurtscheller
et al., 2010; Acqualagna et al., 2016). In a group study, 20
healthy people attained a mean accuracy of 80.7% after 20 min
of training (Ortner et al., 2015). Motor imagery BCIs have also
been validated with LIS patients (Kübler et al., 2005; McFarland
and Vaughan, 2016). Motor imagery paradigms were also used
in 16 UWS patients, and 3 of them were able to control the
BCI system with an accuracy above chance level (Cruse et al.,
2011).
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a well-known cause of
LIS and then CLIS. Patients with ALS, particularly in its later
stages, are more likely to exhibit sleep-wake disturbances than
healthy controls (Lo Coco et al., 2011). Thus, they may have
fluctuating periods of conscious awareness that are not easy to
identify (since their capacity for voluntary movement is reduced
or absent), confounded by the aforementioned possibility of
reduced overall cognitive capacity. These patients may also have
ocular impairments that could limit their use of eye-tracking
devices or other assistive communication tools that require a
healthy visual system (Spataro et al., 2014). These factors suggest
that persons with LIS or CLIS, like persons with DOC, may
benefit from a system designed to assess conscious awareness and
provide communication for persons who can neither move nor
see.
The current study aimed to evaluate mindBEAGLE’s P300 and
motor imagery paradigms for assessment of cognitive function
and communication for LIS patients. Assessment in this context
means to test if a person can follow commands and is able
to perform a paradigm. We also sought to compare these two
approaches to each other. P300 based systems typically need
less training time and achieve higher accuracies than motor
imagery based BCI systems (Guger et al., 2003, 2009; Allison
and Neuper, 2010; Acqualagna et al., 2016), which suggests that
P300 BCIs may be more practical for patients who do not have
time for lengthy training. We also conducted sham runs with
healthy controls to verify system performance. EEG-based BCI
systems were not successfully used with CLIS patients so far and
therefore it is tested if we can establish communication with
them.

FIGURE 1 | mindBEAGLE provides an assessment battery for patients with disorders of consciousness such as unresponsive wakefulness state
(UWS) or minimally conscious state (MCS), as well as locked-in syndrome (LIS) and complete locked-in syndrome (CLIS).
METHODS
Hardware and Software
The mindBEAGLE system provided the hardware and software
platform for all recording, stimulus presentation, and real-time
data analysis. Each system includes a laptop with installed
software, three vibrotactile stimulators, two in-ear headphones,
one g. USBamp biosignal amplifier with 16 channels and 24 Bit
ADC resolution, and one EEG cap with 16 g. LADYbird active
EEG electrodes. The EEG is sampled at 256 Hz and filtered
between 0.1 and 30 Hz. Data were recorded from Fz, C3, Cz,
C4, CP1, CPz, CP2, Pz for the P300 paradigms, and the motor
imagery paradigm used sites FC3, FC4, C5, C1, C2, C6, CP3, and
CP4 as well.
Assessment
This
study
presents
three
of
mindBEAGLE’s
assessment
paradigms:
(1) Vibro-tactile stimulation with 2 tactors (VT2): During
this paradigm, the left and right wrists are randomly
stimulated with a vibro-tactile stimulator for 100 ms each.
One stimulator delivers 87.5% of the stimuli, and the other
stimulator presents only 12.5% of the stimuli. The subject is
verbally instructed to count silently the stimuli on the hand
that receives the less probable target stimuli, which is called
the target hand. During each run, the subject performs this
task four times, with the target hand selected randomly each
time, which results in a recording time of 2.5 min.
(2) Vibro-tactile stimulation with 3 tactors (VT3): During this
paradigm, in addition to tactors on the left and right hands,
one tactor is placed to the back or shoulder of the subject as a
distracter. The distracter receives 75% of the stimuli, while
the left and right wrist each receives 12.5% of the stimuli.
Then, the subject is instructed through earplugs to count
stimuli to the target hand (15 targets, 7∗15 non-targets),
which is either the left or right hand. During each run, the
subject performs this task four times, with the target hand
selected randomly each time, resulting in a recording time of
2.5 min. The VT2 and VT3 paradigms are jointly called the
EP paradigms, as they rely on evoked potentials (EPs) such
as the P300.
(3) Motor imagery (MI): In this paradigm, the subject is verbally
instructed to imagine a left or right hand movement (chosen
randomly) for 4 s. Each such period is followed by a random
interval of 0.5–2 s to avoid adaptation before the next
instruction. The run lasts 9 min and records 30 imagined
movements of each hand.
Signal Processing and Classification
During the assessment runs, the raw EEG data and the
stimulation time points are recorded, and this data is used
to calibrate the BCI for every subject. In the VT2 and VT3
paradigms, data segments of −100 to 600 ms around each
stimulus are extracted and the data is classified using linear
discriminant analysis (LDA) to distinguish target from non-
target stimuli. This results in a classification accuracy ranging
from 0 to 100% that describes how well the data can be
separated. The ratio of target to non-target stimuli is 1: 7,
which results in a chance accuracy of 12.5%. In the MI BCI
system, the data (filtered with 8–30 Hz) from each imagined
movement is used to train a common spatial patterns (CSP)
algorithm that automatically weights each electrode according
to its contribution to discrimination accuracy. In this case, the
data from the window 3–5 s after the instruction is used to
train the CSP algorithm. Next, the variance of a 1.5 s window is
estimated and an LDA classifier is trained to calibrate the system

ALS-BCI
on the subject (Guger et al., 2000). This results in a classification
accuracy ranging from 0 to 100% with a chance accuracy level
of 50% (2-classes are discriminated). The calibration data is
saved for future communication tests, which are described in
the following section. In MI mode the classification accuracy
is calculated with a 10 times 10-fold cross-validation to have
independent training and testing data. In VT2 and VT3 mode
the data is randomly shuffled and 50% are used for training and
50% are used for testing and this procedure is repeated 10 times.
In addition to classification accuracy, mindBEAGLE also
calculates EPs for VT2 and VT3 to compare target and non-
target stimuli. The data is extracted from −100 to 600 ms around
the stimulation, baseline corrected and averaged. A significance
test is performed that presents areas with significant differences
between targets and non-targets as green-shaded areas in the EPs
(p < 0.05). Trials where the amplitude of the EEG signal exceeds
±100 µV are rejected from the EP and classifier calculation.
Communication
A communication test can be performed with VT3 and MI. In the
VT3 paradigm, the operator can ask the subject a question, and
the subject can answer either YES or NO by counting the stimuli
on either the left or right hand. It is necessary to ask questions to
which the answers are known (called copy-spelling mode in the
BCI literature, e.g., Are you born in Italy?) to evaluate the system
accuracy. In the VT3 paradigm, one question can be answered
after 120 stimuli, which requires 38 s. The system only selects YES
or NO if the result is significant. In the MI paradigm, the subject
can answer either YES or NO by imagining either left or right
hand movement for 8 s. In the MI mode the system will always
make a YES or NO decision. In both paradigms, the calibration
data from the previous assessment run is used to calculate a
subject specific classifier that is used for the communication test.
During the task no feedback is provided to the participant, but
after the questions the answer is reported to the patient. During
the communication the subject specific classifier is not updated.
Participants and Recording Locations
Table 1 presents the two locations where data were recorded for
this study: Schiedlberg and Palermo. Each of these locations had
ethical approval for this study from the appropriate supervisory
board at that location (Ethic committee Palermo 1 from the
University Hospital Palermo and Karl Franzens University
Graz). Written informed consent was obtained from all research
participants or legal guardians. Notably, all patient data were
recorded at each patient’s bedside by medical doctors who did
not have an engineering background, without support from any
technical staff. The doctors were trained beforehand to operate
the system and were shown how to check the EEG signal.
This paper presents results from 12 patients (3 CLIS and
9 LIS) and 3 healthy controls. We recruited 12 patients with
a diagnosis of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis according to the
El Escorial diagnostic criteria, regularly followed-up in the ALS
Clinical Research Center and in a LIS or CLIS state.
Details are shown in Table 2. These data were selected to
show the following outcomes, including both assessment and
communication:

Experimental Procedure
LIS Participants’ Procedure
Informed consent was obtained prior to the assessment. Since
most participants were unable to provide consent due to their
disabilities, informed consent was obtained from the patient’s
legal guardian. Patients were lying or sitting in bed during
the assessment and the medical institution selected pseudo-
randomly one of the available paradigms, but VT2 always before
VT3. If the classification accuracy was higher than 60% for the
VT3 (well above the 95% confidence interval with a binomial test
that gives about 23%) and higher than 63.19% (95% confidence
interval for 60 trials using a binomial test) for motor imagery,
the staff may have attempted communication. The decision of
whether to attempt communication included considerations such
as the physician’s assessment of the patient’s fatigue and available
time; thus, clinical considerations were prioritized over research
needs.

ALS-BCI
Healthy Participants and Sham Procedure
The healthy participants gave informed consent directly, without
a legal guardian, and were seated. The experimental protocol
was similar to the LIS patients, with the following changes.
The healthy participants performed two regular runs and one
sham run, across the VT2, VT3, and MI assessment paradigms,
and then across the VT3 and MI communication paradigms.
The order of these runs was determined pseudo-randomly,
and there were nine total assessment runs and four total
communication runs. The communication runs each entailed
five or ten yes/no questions. During the VT2 sham runs, the
vibrotactile stimulators were unplugged. Thus, while subjects still
wore the cap and heard instructions during the VT2 sham runs,
they never received tactile stimuli required to elicit EPs. During
the VT3 and MI sham runs, the system was muted. Thus, during
these two types of sham runs, the patients wore the cap, but
did not hear instructions that were essential for normal system
operation.
This sham assessment was conducted to confirm correct
system operation. We hypothesized that the healthy participants
would exhibit robust EP differences and thus high classification
accuracy in the regular (and not sham) EP paradigms. Indeed,
any other outcome would raise serious concerns about the
other results presented here. We also expected that the healthy
participants would exhibit left vs. right hand imagery differences
in the regular (and not sham) MI runs, although untrained
healthy users can exhibit variable performance with MI BCIs.
RESULTS
Healthy Controls and Sham Results
Table 3 summarizes results from the regular and sham runs
with the three healthy subjects. The table includes classification
accuracies during assessment runs and communication. For the
two EP-based approaches (VT2 and VT3), accuracy is between 60
and 100% in regular runs, and 0 to 25% for sham runs. For the MI
approach, accuracy is above the significance threshold (63.19%)
during the two regular runs, and near chance level (below the
significance level) for the sham run. The column communication
indicates that the accuracy of the communication mode ranged
from 20 to 100%. For assessment, the mean accuracy of VT2 was
higher than the mean accuracy of VT3. VT3 communication was
slightly more accurate than MI communication.
Figure 2 presents results from one healthy control (S1) for
all three paradigms (VT2, VT3, and MI) for one regular run
and one sham run. In the VT2 and VT3 paradigms, the subject
showed a robust P300 response to target events only, and attained
100/100% classification accuracy within less than 12 stimulus
repetitions. As expected, during sham runs, the subject does
not exhibit clear target vs. non-target EP differences, and the
accuracy is below 12.5% (chance accuracy). Please note that the
VT2 paradigm had seven times more non-target trials than target
trials, which explains why the non-target EPs look smoother than
the target EPs. In the VT3 paradigm the distractor had more trials
than the target and non-target. In the MI paradigm, the mean
accuracy from second 5 to 7 is 86.3% for run 2 and 49.0% for the
sham condition.
Patients
Table 4 shows the results over all patients for VT2, VT3 and
MI paradigms, including assessment and communication results.
For assessment, VT2 results are between 20 and 100%, VT3 is
between 10 and 100% and MI is between 42 and 83%. In VT3, all
communication tests resulted in correct answers to at least 7 out
of 10 questions—8 out of 10 on average. If the VT3 assessment
reached 100% accuracy (in 5 runs), then the communication was
between 80 and 90% accurate. MI communication was successful
in all communication tests (3 runs).
Figure 3 shows VT2, VT3, and MI results from LIS patient 5.
The VT2 EP shows significant target vs. non-target differences,
and the P300 is prominent around 300–500 ms. For the VT3, the
EP differences are less prominent to the naked eye. The median
accuracy for VT2 is 100%, and for VT3, it is 100%. The classifier
is able to separate the motor imagery data with 83% accuracy.
Figure 4 shows two interesting cases with atypical EPs. P3
shows a broad negative peak to target stimuli only that is largest
around 250 ms on all 8 channels that are analyzed for the VT3
paradigm used here. The EPs do not exhibit typical peaks such
as the N1, P2, N2, or P3. Nonetheless, the classification accuracy
reached very soon 100% accuracy (median accuracy 100%),
which shows that the target vs. non-target EPs can be separated
despite their unusual waveforms.
P10 also shows an atypical waveform. P10 has an early positive
wave to target stimuli that peaks a little after 200 ms. This signal
has a peak amplitude of 42.5 µV on C4, and is robust on other
sites as well. The non-target stimuli produced a much smaller
positive peak at about the same time. The waveform preceding
this positive peak has very small inflections that look similar
to peaks that precede the P300, but these peaks (like the large
positive peak) seem too early. The median classification accuracy
is 90%, which shows the clear difference between targets and
non-targets.
DISCUSSION
The VT2, VT3, and MI assessment paradigms were used in
healthy persons and LIS/CLIS patients. All healthy controls and
10 out of 12 LIS patients were able to achieve high accuracies
during the assessment runs (≥70%). 9 out of 12 LIS patients
also communicated with the VT3 paradigm, and 3 of these
also communicated with the MI paradigm. More importantly
the system allowed 2 CLIS patients out of 3 to communicate.
This was not shown beforehand with an EEG-based BCI
system (Chaudhary et al., 2017). The VT2 paradigm (76.6%)
allowed a higher mean accuracy than VT3 (63.1%), which was
more accurate than MI (58.2%). There are several reasons for
these accuracy differences. First, the VT2 and VT3 assessment
paradigms are only 2.5 min long, instead of 9 min for the MI
assessment paradigm, and therefore it may be easier for patients
to maintain concentration. Second, the VT2 and VT3 assessment
paradigms have more stimuli per second than the MI assessment
paradigm, which may also help patients maintain concentration.
Third, the VT2 paradigm is the easiest for patients. Unlike
the other two paradigms, it is a passive paradigm, and can

Chance accuracy was 12.5% in both EP runs and 50% in the MI runs. As an example 4/5 means that 4 answers out of 5 questions were given correctly and 1 answer was either

VT2 and VT3 communication it takes 38 s to answer 1 question and in MI communication it takes 8 s to answer 1 question.

yield EP differences to target vs. non-target stimuli even if the
patient is not actively participating. In this study, the patients
were instructed to actively count the target (deviant) stimuli to
produce an active P300 response that is normally higher than a
passive P300 response. Also, the VT3 paradigm exhibits training
effects, presumably because it is slightly harder to learn (Ortner

Communication accuracy is also presented as the number of questions answered correctly out of 10 questions (VT3) or 5 questions (MI). As an example 9/10 means that 9 answers out
of 10 questions were given correctly and 1 answer was either undetermined or wrong in VT3 communication mode and wrong in MI communication mode. Runs are shown in different
rows for a session. A “-“ shows that the paradigm was not performed. The VT2 and VT3 assessment runs last 2.5 min (4 instructions with 15 targets each), the MI assessment runs
lasts 9 min (60 instructions). In VT2 and VT3 communication it takes 38 s to answer 1 question and in MI communication it takes 8 s to answer 1 question.
FIGURE 3 | EPs and accuracies for VT2, VT3, and MI runs of LIS patient 5. The patient achieved an average accuracy of 83% for MI, 100% for VT2, and 100%
for VT3. Communication was possible with the MI and VT3 paradigms. In the bottom figure, the vertical red line indicates when the cue is presented to the subject,
while the horizontal red line represents 50% accuracy (corresponding to chance performance).
et al., 2013). Fourth, the literature has shown that some training
is required to attain good accuracy with MI BCIs, and subjects
in this study were untrained. Fifth, the literature has also shown
that some persons are never able to attain high accuracy with MI
BCIs, which seems to be less problematic with P300 BCIs (Allison
and Neuper, 2010; Acqualagna et al., 2016).

FIGURE 4 | EPs and classification accuracies for patients P3 during the VT2 assessment paradigm (top) and P10 during the VT3 assessment paradigm
(bottom). The number presented in the bottom right of each accuracy plot is the mean accuracy. While both patients attained high accuracies, their EPs exhibit
atypical waveforms.
A recent study achieved a mean accuracy of 80% with VT2 and
55.3% with VT3 in 6 LIS patients. This is a bit better than in this
study for VT2 (+3.4%) and a bit worse for VT3 (−2,9%) but did
not record from CLIS (Lugo et al., 2014). The current study has a
mean accuracy of 80% for VT2 and 57.5% for VT3.
The advantage of the EP assessment paradigms is that both can
be used very quickly to see if the patient is able to perform the
task as shown step-by-step in (Ortner et al., in press). They can
also be used to quickly determine whether the patient is awake
or sleeping during the BCI experiment. 9 of the 12 patients were
able to communicate effectively using the VT3 paradigm. Two
of these patients (P10 and P12) needed an additional assessment
run to achieve a high enough classification accuracy of >60%,
while 7 patients achieved high enough classification accuracy in
the first run. P7 and P9 achieved only 10−50% accuracy across
both types of EP runs, which was too low for communication. P11
achieved 70% with the VT2 run, but this mode does not allow
communication. In the VT3 mode, P11’s accuracy was too low
for communication. This result with P11 may indicate that P11
was able to perform a passive paradigm such as VT2, but not an
active paradigm like VT3. P11 was the only person in this study
diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia, which may explain this
result (see Table 2). Another reason could be that the patient just
needs more training time or that the patient was already tired
after the VT2 run.
If the VT3 assessment accuracy was above 60%, then a
communication run was also performed, in which 10 questions
with a known answer were asked. No patient was able to
answer all questions successfully, but 3 patients answered 9
correctly, 3 answered 8 correctly, and 3 answered 7 correctly.
The healthy persons during the non-sham runs attained an
overall mean communication accuracy of about 80%. Notably, 1
healthy person (S2) achieved only 20% accuracy in the first VT3
run and was able to improve to 100% in the second run. This
result with S2 supports our supposition that the VT3 paradigm
may be more difficult than VT2 and entail some training,
which was also observed in both P10 and P12. The successful
communication in the study showed that the 60% threshold
could eventually also be lowered in the future to establish
communication.

In MI mode, 3 patients’ MI assessments indicated the
potential for communication, and all three of them successfully
communicated. The assessment accuracies were only 73, 83,
and 74%, but they were able to answer 14 out of 15 questions
correctly. The MI classifier is calculated from 60 right and left
motor imagery trials that each entail 4 s of motor imagery. The
communication mode provides 8 s to answer each question,
which provides more data for analysis and results in the higher
communication accuracy compared to the assessment accuracy.
For the healthy controls, the mean MI assessment accuracy was
about 71%, but 33 out of 40 questions were answered correctly
(82.5%).
It is also important to note that participant did not get
any feedback during the assessment or communication runs
while the experimenter was able to see the on-line updated
evoked potentials of all 8 channels or the on-line updated
ERD maps. After a question was answered with the system,
the experimenter communicated the selected answer to the
participant. This could have an important motivation effect for
the patient, but we don’t have enough data to show any training
effects.
The system is using 8 EEG channels for the VT2 and VT3
paradigms and allows us to see which regions are generating
EPs. 8 EEG channels are also used for visual P300 spellers, which
yielded a grand average accuracy of 100% for a 17 healthy subjects
group study (Guger et al., 2016a). The motor imagery paradigm
uses 16 channels to increase classification accuracy with the CSP
algorithm. With healthy controls, an accuracy of around 80%
can be expected with minimal training (Ortner et al., 2015).
Ortner and colleagues used 64 channels for this study, but similar
accuracies can also be achieved with fewer electrodes with a dense
arrangement around the sensorimotor cortex (Guger et al., 2000).
The BCI technology makes it easy to determine whether
target and non-target stimuli can be discriminated, which is
sometimes difficult if the EP waveform is only investigated
visually. Visual inspection of averaged EPs may miss trial to trial
variations in EPs, and the BCI system takes every single trial
into consideration. The BCI system also indicates how many
stimuli are required to reach different levels of classification
accuracy, which reflects the difference in P300 s and other EPs
resulting from attention to the target stimulus. More robust EP
differences will lead to a higher accuracy earlier than weaker
responses.
An important feature of the system is that different paradigms
can be applied for assessment and communication. A recent
study used fMRI and motor imagery EEG to detect command
following and therefore awareness in VS and MCS patients.
3 out of 6 patients showed spatial navigation with fMRI, 1
out of 6 showed motor imagery with fMRI and 2 out of 6
showed motor imagery with EEG (Gibson et al., 2014). Also, in
the current study, only 3 out of 12 patients showed successful
communication with the motor imagery BCI, but 9 out of 12
were able to use the VT paradigm successfully. Therefore, a
system with standardized tests is highly recommended for testing
patients. A further advantage of the current system compared to
fMRI is that it is easy to use, fast to use, portable, and of low cost
(Guger et al., 2016b).
Another study recently published showed that an fNIRS based
system is able to establish yes/no communication with CLIS
(Chaudhary et al., 2017). These patients were trained to regulate
their frontal centered brain regions in response to auditory
questions and were trained in more than 40 sessions to reach
accuracies between 64.3 and 78.8% in LIS and CLIS. In the
current study the grand average communication accuracy was
80% for all patients that were able to communicate and this is
clearly better than with fNIRS. The current study also includes
all patients that were available at the clinical center. A further
advantage of the current system is the short assessment and
communication time. All patients were only trained for 5 to
20 min and communication was established in the majority.
With additional training even a higher success rate can be
expected.
A limitation of the study is the lack of time to perform more
training. It could be that patients that did not communicate in
this study could do that with more training time. Also, several
runs could be done on different days to describe training effects
and fluctuations.
In the study we enrolled all LIS/CLIS patients that were
available for the University of Palermo. Three patients were
diagnosed as CLIS and 9 patients were LIS and the study could
show that a majority of patients can communicate with the
system.
In the future, we will further implement these tests with
VS/USW and MSC patients to study the absence/presence of
vibro-tactile P300 responses and motor imagery responses as
diagnostic tools. In these patients, the EEG has many advantages
compared to fMRI recordings: (i) easy to use, (ii) inexpensive,
(iii) works with patients with metallic implants, (iv) faster brain
response.
SUMMARY
While earlier results have shown that persons with LIS resulting
from ALS can communicate with BCIs that do not rely on
visual stimuli, the present study extends these results in three
ways. First, this is the first study that shows that an EEG-based
BCI system can establish communication with CLIS. Second,
it shows that non-visual BCI technology can be used to assess
command following in these patients. Third, this is the first study
to show that the mindBEAGLE system, which is designed to be
easy to use without technical expertise, can provide a practical
and usable platform for both assessment and communication in
these patients. This outcome is reflected in the right panel of
Figure 1.
Healthy controls achieve higher accuracies in assessment
and communication than LIS patients, but 9 out of 12 LIS
patients could use the VT3 paradigm to answer questions.
Only 3 out of 12 LIS patients could use the MI based system
to answer questions after a training run. Therefore, the VT3
paradigm can provide limited communication with a LIS patient
without substantial training. Although the MI paradigm could
not provide communication for most subjects, it can potentially
provide faster communication than the VT3 paradigm. Like

most BCIs, the trade-off between speed and accuracy is largely a
function of each user’s abilities and preferences; the MI and VT3
paradigms could be faster at the expense of reduced accuracy, and
vice versa.
A big advantage of a flexible assessment and communication
system is the ability to quickly test whether a patient is able to
answer questions, which can provide insight about remaining
cognitive functions. In future the mindBEAGLE system will also
be tested to identify fluctuations of awareness in order to guide
the usage of other BCI-based platforms for communication and
restoration of function.
