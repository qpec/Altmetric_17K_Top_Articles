The vast majority of states have enacted full or partial medical marijuana (MMJ)
programs, causing the number of patients seeking certification for MMJ use to increase
dramatically in recent years. Despite increased use of MMJ across the nation, no studies
thus far have examined the specific impact of MMJ on cognitive function and related
brain activation. In the present study, MMJ patients seeking treatment for a variety of
documented medical conditions were assessed prior to initiating MMJ treatment and
after 3 months of treatment as part of a larger longitudinal study. In order to examine the
effect of MMJ treatment on task-related brain activation, MMJ patients completed the
Multi-Source Interference Test (MSIT) while undergoing functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI). We also collected data regarding conventional medication use, clinical
state, and health-related measures at each visit. Following 3 months of treatment, MMJ
patients demonstrated improved task performance accompanied by changes in brain
activation patterns within the cingulate cortex and frontal regions. Interestingly, after
MMJ treatment, brain activation patterns appeared more similar to those exhibited
by healthy controls from previous studies than at pre-treatment, suggestive of a
potential normalization of brain function relative to baseline. These findings suggest that
MMJ use may result in different effects relative to recreational marijuana (MJ) use, as
recreational consumers have been shown to exhibit decrements in task performance
accompanied by altered brain activation. Moreover, patients in the current study also
reported improvements in clinical state and health-related measures as well as notable
decreases in prescription medication use, particularly opioids and benzodiapezines after
3 months of treatment. Further research is needed to clarify the specific neurobiologic
impact, clinical efficacy, and unique effects of MMJ for a range of indications and how it
compares to recreational MJ use.

MMJ fMRI and Executive Function
INTRODUCTION
Currently, 30 states and the District of Columbia have medical
marijuana (MMJ) programs or pending MMJ legislation, an
additional 16 states have passed laws to allow limited access
to MMJ, and an estimated 2.6 million individuals in the
United States are certified for MMJ use (Procon.org). Since
societal attitudes toward marijuana (MJ) have generally warmed,
an increasing number of individuals are turning to MMJ to
help treat a variety of medical conditions, as patients often
do not achieve full symptom alleviation with conventional
medications and experience unwanted side effects. Data gathered
from several US surveys of MMJ patients indicate that the
most common indications for MMJ use included pain-related
concerns (i.e., chronic pain, headaches), psychiatric disorders
(i.e., anxiety, depression), and insomnia (Nunberg et al., 2011;
Reinarman et al., 2011; Bonn-Miller et al., 2014; Park and Wu,
2017). Although considerable research efforts have clarified the
impact of recreational MJ use, particularly among adolescent and
young adult populations, to date, there is a paucity of research
focused on examining the impact of MMJ use on neurobiologic
measures, including brain function and structure. As the number
of MMJ patients continues to grow, research efforts designed
to understand potential changes associated with MMJ use are
critically important.
A large body of evidence from the past several decades
suggests that recreational MJ use is related to cognitive
decrements, including deficits in verbal memory (Tait et al., 2011;
Auer et al., 2016; Shuster et al., 2016), processing speed (Fried
et al., 2005; Lisdahl and Price, 2012; Jacobus et al., 2015), attention
(Ehrenreich et al., 1999; Cousijn et al., 2013; Becker et al., 2014)
and executive function (Crean et al., 2011; Gruber et al., 2012b;
Solowij et al., 2012; Dougherty et al., 2013; Hanson et al., 2014;
Jacobus et al., 2015; Dahlgren et al., 2016). While these deficits
have been observed in adult MJ users (Nader and Sanchez, 2017),
they are most salient among MJ-using adolescents (Lisdahl et al.,
2014) who are in the midst of critical neurodevelopment (Giedd
et al., 1999). Furthermore, these decrements have also been linked
to alterations in brain structure and function. Although the
directionality of structural alterations appears to be dependent
on the brain region under investigation (Batalla et al., 2013),
studies show that gray and white matter alterations are associated
with increased executive dysfunction (Medina et al., 2009, 2010;
Churchwell et al., 2010; Clark et al., 2012; Price et al., 2015). In
addition, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies
have reported altered activation patterns within the prefrontal
cortex as well as orbitofrontal, cingulate, and subcortical/limbic
regions of recreational MJ users compared to non-using control
subjects during tasks of executive function (Lisdahl et al., 2014,
for review). Further, similar to studies of cognitive performance
and brain structure, fMRI studies have revealed that earlier onset
of MJ use is related to altered patterns of brain activation during
tasks requiring cognitive control and inhibition (Tapert et al.,
2007; Gruber et al., 2012a; Sagar et al., 2015).
Although many have posited that MMJ use would be
associated
with
similar
deficits,
preliminary
studies
have
suggested that this may not be the case. In our own recent
pilot investigation (Gruber et al., 2016), the only study to date
to examine the impact of whole plant-derived MMJ products
on cognitive performance, we found that MMJ patients did
not demonstrate decrements in performance on measures of
executive function following 3 months of MMJ treatment. In
fact, patients generally demonstrated improved performance on
a number of measures, particularly those assessing executive
function. Improvements were also noted on several measures
of quality of life, sleep, and depression relative to pre-MMJ
treatment levels. Differences between recreational and MMJ users
may be related to a variety of factors, including age of onset of
MJ use, duration, magnitude and frequency of use, and choice
of actual cannabis products used. Although products used by
recreational MJ consumers and MMJ patients are derived from
the same plant species, they are generally utilized for different
purposes (i.e., to get high/alter one’
s current state of being
vs. symptom alleviation). Accordingly, recreational and medical
users often seek different MJ products with various constituent
compositions based on the desired effect. Recreational MJ users
often seek products high in �9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the
main psychoactive constituent of the cannabis plant, and while
medical patients may also choose products with high THC levels
they often seek products high in other potentially therapeutic
cannabinoids. Research has begun to focus on the beneficial
effects of cannabidiol (CBD), the primary non-intoxicating
constituent of MJ, which has been touted for its antipsychotic,
anxiolytic, anti-seizure, and anti-inflammatory properties (Rong
et al., 2017). While studies from recreational MJ users have
reported a relationship between higher levels of THC and
poorer cognitive performance (Ramaekers et al., 2006; Kowal
et al., 2015) the acute administration of CBD prior to THC
has been shown to improve cognitive function (Morgan et al.,
2010; Englund et al., 2013), underscoring the need for further
study. Moreover, Yücel et al. (2016) recently found that although
MJ users exposed to THC exhibit alterations in hippocampal
volume and neurochemistry, those who utilized CBD-containing
products did not demonstrate differences relative to healthy
controls. Similarly, a recent review of the effects of THC and CBD
on neuroanatomy concluded that MJ users are prone to brain
alterations in regions with high cannabinoid receptor density,
and although THC exacerbates these alterations, CBD appears to
protect against these deleterious changes (Lorenzetti et al., 2016).
In addition, several researchers have administered pure THC or
CBD to healthy control participants to investigate the impact of
these constituents on brain activation patterns using fMRI. In
general, studies suggest that THC and CBD have opposite effects
on cognition-related brain activation (Bhattacharyya et al., 2010,
2015; Winton-Brown et al., 2011). This may be related to the
fact that THC is a CB1 agonist with strong binding affinity for
CB1 receptors, while CBD appears to exert effects through more
indirect mechanisms, which include additional receptor types
(Zuardi, 2008; Ashton and Moore, 2011). Despite preliminary
work investigating the acute effects of pure THC and CBD on
neural networks associated with cognitive domains impacted by
MJ use, to our knowledge, no studies thus far have examined the
impact of treatment with whole-plant-derived MMJ products on
brain activation patterns.

MMJ fMRI and Executive Function
In order to investigate whether pilot observations of improved
executive function (Gruber et al., 2016) persist with larger sample
sizes and to determine whether these changes co-occur with
altered brain activation patterns, MMJ patients from an ongoing
longitudinal study underwent fMRI while completing the Multi-
Source Interference Test (MSIT). The MSIT is a robust measure
of cognitive interference, a core facet of executive functioning,
which is related to attentional control and inhibitory processing
and requires actively shifting attention by inhibiting automatic
responses (Lezak et al., 2004). This task reliably activates frontal
brain regions associated with executive functioning, particularly
the cingulo-frontal-parietal (CFP) network (Bush and Shin,
2006). Given our previous findings (Gruber et al., 2016), we
hypothesized that following 3 months of treatment, MMJ patients
would demonstrate improved task performance, and that this
improvement would coincide with changes in brain activation
patterns measured by fMRI. We have previously utilized the
MSIT to better characterize patterns of cingulate and frontal
brain activation within clinical and non-clinical cohorts (Gruber
et al., 2012a, 2017), and although no studies thus far have
examined MMJ patients using neuroimaging techniques, we
hypothesized that improved MSIT task performance would be
associated with increased activation in these regions following
3 months of MMJ treatment. We also posited that these changes
would occur in the context of improved mood and quality of life
ratings.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants
To date, of 45 consented participants, 41 MMJ patients were
enrolled and data from 22 patients’
pre-treatment (Visit 1) and
3-month check-in visits (Visit 2) were available for analyses.
In addition, patients who were free of MRI contraindications
also completed neuroimaging procedures (n = 15). In order to
qualify for study entry, patients had to be over the age of 18,
and have an estimated IQ of 75 or higher as assessed by the
Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI; Wechsler,
1999). In order to minimize the effects of previous MJ exposure
on study findings, patients were required to be MJ naïve or be
abstinent from MJ use for at least 2 years for their pre-treatment
visit. Patients were also required to be certified for MMJ use, or
describe a plan to use industrial hemp derived products (which do
not currently require certification). All subjects received payment
for each study visit, and those who completed MRI procedures
were compensated additionally in accordance with Partners IRB-
approved protocol procedures.
Study Design
Prior to participation, all study procedures were explained,
and each participant was required to provide written informed
consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. This
document and all study procedures were approved by the
Partners Institutional Review Board. Eligible participants were
enrolled in a larger longitudinal study designed to assess the
impact of MMJ on cognition and brain function over the course
of 12–
24 months. Patients completed all assessments and imaging
prior to initiation of MMJ treatment and again after 3 months of
treatment.
As part of a larger neuroimaging protocol, participants
completed the MSIT (Bush et al., 2003; Bush and Shin, 2006)
with concurrent fMRI scanning using identical task parameters
as reported in our previous studies of recreational MJ users,
patients with bipolar disorder, and healthy controls (Gruber
et al., 2012a, 2017). Using aspects from well-established measures
of cognitive interference (e.g., Stroop, Simon, and Flanker
tasks), the MSIT incorporates both spatial and flanker types
of interference to measure cognitive control (Bush et al., 2003;
Bush and Shin, 2006). During the task, three-digit stimuli sets
comprised of the numbers 0, 1, 2, or 3 are presented briefly
on a screen. Each set contains two identical distractor numbers
and a target number that differs from the distractors. Using
a button box, participants report the identity of the target
number that differs from the two distractor numbers during two
conditions: during the Control condition, distractor numbers
are always zeros, and the identity of the target number always
corresponds to its position on the button box (i.e., 100, 020,
003). During the Interference condition, patients are required
to inhibit a prepotent response in favor of a less automatic
response (i.e., indicate the identity of the target number rather
its position). Distractor numbers are always numbers other than
0, and the identity of the target number is always incongruent
with its position on the button box (e.g., 211, 232, 331, etc.).
Performance is measured by reaction time and percent accuracy,
which can be further subdivided by error type. Omission
errors occur when no response is given and are typically
reflective of slower or overloaded cognitive processing while
commission errors, or incorrect responses, generally indicate
difficulty inhibiting inappropriate responses. The entire task is
comprised of four blocks of control trials alternating with four
blocks of interference trials; the task begins and ends with
a fixation period (30 s), making the total run time 6 min
and 36 s (see Figure 1 for graphic representation of the task
design).
Patients also completed a battery of self-report rating
scales. Briefly, these included the Profile of Mood States
(POMS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Beck Anxiety
Inventory (BAI), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Barratt
Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11), and the Short Form-36 Health
Survey (SF-36), a measure of functional health and quality
of life. During each study visit, participants also provided
information regarding dose, frequency, and duration of use for all
conventional medications, which were categorized into different
classes, including opioids, antidepressants, mood stabilizers, and
benzodiazepines. Percent change data was calculated to assess
potential changes in medication use from pre- to post-3 months
of MMJ treatment.
After completing pre-treatment assessments, patients began
MMJ treatment at their discretion. Although patients selected
their own products and determined their own treatment
regimens, we collected detailed data about MMJ use patterns
and products. Between study visits, patients submitted biweekly
diaries documenting MMJ use and were contacted by phone on

MMJ fMRI and Executive Function
FIGURE 1 | MSIT task design: the MSIT begins and ends with a 30 s fixation. It contains eight total blocks, which alternate between Control (C) and Interference (I)
conditions: C, I, C, I, C, I, C, I. Each block is 42 s long, containing 24 trials each, for a total of 384 total trails across the task. For each trial, stimuli are presented for
1.25 s with an interstimulus interval of 0.5 s, which yields a total run time of 6 min and 36 s.
a monthly basis to acquire information regarding MMJ product
type, frequency, magnitude, and modes of use using a modified
timeline follow-back procedure (TLFB; Sobell et al., 1998).
Following a minimum of 3 months of regular MMJ treatment,
patients returned for their first of several check in visits (Visit 2)
where they repeated all study measures. In addition, participants
were asked to provide a sample of their most frequently
used MMJ product(s) to an outside laboratory (ProVerde
Laboratories, Inc.) for cannabinoid constituent profiling. These
analyses, which quantified the levels of 10 major cannabinoids
including THC and CBD, will be used to identify the unique
effects of specific cannabinoids in future analyses.
Statistical Analyses
Descriptive statistics were calculated for demographic and MMJ
use variables. Repeated-measure analyses of variance (ANOVAs)
were used to assess changes in clinical state from Visit 1 to Visit
2. The assumption of homogeneity of variance was confirmed
using Levene’
s F; however, Shapiro–
Wilk tests indicated that data
for the MSIT were not normally distributed. Accordingly, non-
parametric, repeated-measures Wilcoxon Signed Rank Tests were
used to assess changes from Visit 1 to Visit 2 for MSIT data.
It is of note, however, that the non-parametric tests resulted in
similar findings as the ANOVAs; all significant results remained.
For the MSIT analyses, alpha was set at 0.05 for the response time
and percent accuracy variables. In cases where percent accuracy
differed significantly between Visits 1 and 2, comparisons of
the two different error types (omission, commission) utilized a
Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons (α/2 = 0.025).
fMRI Methods and Analyses
All imaging was performed on a Siemens Trio whole body 3T
MRI scanner (Siemens Corporation, Erlangen, Germany) using
a 12-channel phased array head coil. For the MSIT, 40 contiguous
coronal slices were acquired from each participant, ensuring
whole brain coverage (5 mm thick, 0 mm skip), and images were
collected with TR = 3000, using a single shot, gradient pulse
echo sequence (TE = 30 ms, flip angle = 90, with a 20 cm field
of view and a 64 × 64 acquisition matrix; in plane resolution
3.125 mm × 3.125 mm × 3.125 mm). A total of 132 images per
slice were collected.
fMRI images were analyzed using SPM8 (version 4667,
Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, University
College, London, United Kingdom) software package running
in
MATLAB
(version
R2010b,
MathWorks,
Natick,
MA,
United States). First, blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD)
fMRI data were corrected for slice timing and for motion in SPM8
using a two-step intra-run realignment algorithm that uses the
mean image created after the first realignment as a reference.
A criterion of 3 mm of head motion in any direction was used
as an exclusionary criterion. The realigned images were then
normalized to an EPI template in Montreal Neurological Institute
stereotactic space using DARTEL. Normalized images were re-
sampled into 3 mm3 voxels and then spatially smoothed using an
isotropic Gaussian kernel with 6 mm full width at half maximum.
Global scaling was not used, high-pass temporal filtering with
a cut-off of 168 s was applied, and serial autocorrelations were
modeled with an AR(1) model in SPM8. Using a general linear
model, statistical parametric images were calculated individually
for each subject showing Interference > Control. These images
were subsequently entered into second level model, subjected to
a voxel-wise contrast and t-test to assess statistical significance.
In addition to the realignment during the preprocessing, effects
of motion were further corrected by removing motion related
components from the data by including the calculated motion
parameters from the realignment as regressors in the GLM
(e.g., six nuisance regressors corresponding to three directions
of translation and three axes of rotation). Regions of interest
(ROI) masks were created using the Wake Forest University
Pickatlas utility (Maldjian et al., 2003) and included cingulate and
frontal regions. Specifically, the cingulate ROI was comprised of
both bilateral anterior and mid cingulate regions (22,302 voxels)
while the frontal ROI was comprised of bilateral superior
frontal, middle frontal and inferior frontal gyri (6,857 voxels;
see Supplementary Figure 1). These regions were selected as the
cingulate (CC) and frontal cortices are associated with inhibitory
processing and are reliably activated during the completion of
the MSIT (Bush and Shin, 2006; Gruber et al., 2012a, 2017).
Contrast analyses consisted of the subtraction of one map from

the other; for example, the cingulate activity of Visit 1 was
subtracted from cingulate activity of Visit 2 to determine which
areas showed increased activity over the course of treatment. As
in previous studies (Heckers et al., 2004; Harrison et al., 2007;
Yucel et al., 2007; Shin et al., 2011; Harding et al., 2012), the
fixation point was not included in planned contrast analyses.
The statistical threshold was set at p < 0.05 for cluster level
family-wise-error (FWE), p < 0.001 for voxel level FWE with a
minimum cluster extent k = 15 contiguous voxels in accordance
with previously published manuscripts that have utilized the
MSIT and have used a k-value of 15 (Gruber et al., 2012a) or
lower (Harding et al., 2012; Bush et al., 2013). In addition to
utilizing previously published k-values, we also conducted Monte
Carlo simulations (Ward, 2000) to determine a more rigorous
cluster extent for p < 0.001 which yielded k = 91. As two ROIs
were used for analyses, data was also corrected for multiple
comparisons, generating a new statistical threshold (p < 0.0005).
One patient was excluded from MSIT analyses as they requested
early termination of scanning procedures.
RESULTS
Demographics and MMJ Use
All patients (11 male, 11 female) were between the ages of 28–
74
(M = 50.64, SD = 13.15) who reported seeking MMJ treatment
for a variety of conditions including pain (n = 13), anxiety/PTSD
(n = 10), sleep (n = 10), mood (n = 8), and “
other”conditions
(n = 8), which included gastrointestinal issues, difficulty with
attention, and additional indications not specified by the state of
Massachusetts. Patients in the current sample were generally well-
educated; all had earned a high school diploma, many completed
advanced education (M = 15.91 years, SD = 1.97), and all
were of at least average intelligence as measured by the WASI
(M = 117.23, SD = 7.63). Upon initiation of MMJ treatment,
all patients reported at least weekly use, which ranged from 1.5
times per week to multiple times per day. As noted in Table 1,
patients reported using MMJ products an average of 5.34 days per
week and 1.83 times per day for an overall average of 10.26 total
episodes of MMJ use per week. Patients also indicated various
routes of administration, including smoking and vaporizing
flower, as well as use of oil and concentrates (vaporized and oral
administration), tinctures, edibles, and topicals.
MSIT Behavioral Performance
Relative to pre-treatment, patients demonstrated improved
MSIT performance following 3 months of MMJ treatment
(Table 2). During the Control condition, patients exhibited
improved performance, marked by fewer omission errors;
however, qualitative analyses revealed that patients approached
near perfect levels of performance pre-and post-treatment for
this condition. During the Interference condition, patients
performed notably better at Visit 2, demonstrating significantly
fewer omission and a trend for fewer commission errors, and
thus significantly improved percent accuracy. In addition, MMJ
patients also demonstrated faster response times during Visit 2,
relative to Visit 1, across both Control and Interference trials.

MSIT fMRI Data
Interestingly, in addition to improved task performance, MMJ
patients exhibited notable changes in brain activation patterns in
terms of both magnitude and location from Visit 1 to Visit 2.
Results are provided in Table 3 which includes data for both
the a priori threshold of k = 15 and also indicates which
values survived the new threshold of k = 91 determined by
the Monte Carlo simulations. After initiating MMJ treatment,
patients generally exhibited increased activation within both
the cingulate and frontal ROIs. Specifically, within the CC
ROI, single-sample analyses revealed no significant activation at
Visit 1, yet at Visit 2 patients exhibited focal activation within
the midcingulate cortex (k = 165). Within-subjects contrast
analyses between Visit 1 and Visit 2 revealed no significant
activation differences for Visit 1 > Visit 2, but the Visit
2 > Visit 1 contrast indicated activation differences within
the right anterior cingulate (k = 43). Within the frontal ROI,
single-sample analyses revealed activation at Visit 1 within the
left superior (k = 65) and the right inferior frontal gyrus
(k = 19), and at Visit 2, within the right inferior (k = 575),
left middle frontal gyrus (k = 217), and the left precentral
gyrus (k = 19). Within-subjects contrast analyses between Visit
1 and Visit 2 yielded no significant activation differences for
the Visit 1 > Visit 2 contrast; however, the Visit 2 > Visit
1 contrast revealed significant activation differences within the
right middle gyrus (k = 88) and superior frontal gyrus (k = 25).

consistent with a previous report (Gruber et al., 2016),
patients reported significant improvements on measures of
depression (BDI), impulsivity (BIS-11), sleep (PSQI), and
quality of life (SF-36). Specifically, on the SF-36, patients
indicated significantly improved energy/fatigue and fewer role
limitations due to physical health, which reflects how often

activities. A trend also emerged suggesting improved social
functioning.
In addition to improvements in clinical state and quality
of life, following 3 months of MMJ treatment, patients
reported reductions in their use of conventional pharmaceutical
products across several drug classes. Specifically, patients
taking opioids reported a 47.69% reduction in use and those
prescribed benzodiazepines reported a 46.91% reduction in
use. Antidepressant use decreased by 22.35% while the use
of mood stabilizers decreased by 28.57% between Visit 1 and
Visit 2.
DISCUSSION
Following 3 months of MMJ treatment, patients exhibited
improved task performance and related alterations in frontal
brain activation patterns during the completion of the MSIT,
a measure of executive function and cognitive control, relative
to pre-MMJ treatment. Within the cingulate cortex (CC),
patients did not exhibit any significant pre-treatment activation
during the Interference condition of the MSIT; however,
after 3 months of treatment, robust activation was noted
within this region. In fact, the magnitude of activation
significantly increased over the course of treatment such that
post-treatment activation patterns appeared more similar to
that of healthy controls observed in previous studies (Bush
and Shin, 2006; Gruber et al., 2012a). Activation within the
frontal ROI was also notably increased following 3 months
of MMJ treatment relative to pre-MMJ treatment. Taken
together, these changes may be reflective of a potential
“
normalization”of brain function following 3 months of MMJ
use.
Further, changes in brain activation patterns were observed
in the context of improved task performance and self-reported
improvements in mood and quality of life as well as reduced
sleep disturbance and lower motor impulsivity, consistent
with previously published preliminary data (Gruber et al.,
2016). It is possible that improvements in symptomatology
(i.e., relief of symptoms, improved mood/sleep) are directly
related to observed improvements in cognitive function and
alterations in brain activation. Patients in the present study
most commonly endorsed pain and anxiety as their reasons for
MMJ certification; both of these conditions have previously been
associated with reduced cognitive performance (Moriarty et al.,
2011; Vytal et al., 2013). Symptom improvement may therefore
result in improved cognitive performance, and subsequently
impact patterns of brain activation during completion of these
tasks.
In addition to reduced symptomatology resulting in improved
cognitive performance, it is also possible that several other
factors may have also contributed to the observed changes.
Patients reported notable decreases in their use of opioids,
benzodiazepines, antidepressants, and mood stabilizers, and
it is possible that reductions in conventional medications
influenced changes in brain activation patterns. In fact, several
studies have shown that mood stabilizers, benzodiazepines,
and antidepressants generally attenuate activation (Bell et al.,
2005; Del-Ben et al., 2005; Paulus et al., 2005; Arce et al.,
2008; Murphy et al., 2009). In particular, Bell et al. (2005)
reported that use of mood stabilizers is related to hypoactivation
of the CFP network, a key region implicated in cognitive
interference processing. While we are not aware of fMRI
research focused on the effects of short-term prescriptive
doses of opioids in humans, one study examining opioid
dependence reported that normalization of frontal brain
activation patterns was related to days since last drug use
(Bunce et al., 2015). Reduction or cessation of use of these
medications may therefore alter patterns of brain activation.
Accordingly, future studies are needed to disentangle the effects

users, have reported decrements in cognitive performance and
accompanying atypical neural alterations. A recent review
highlighting neuroimaging findings in recreational MJ users
found evidence for altered frontal neural function during
completion of executive function tasks (Weinstein et al., 2016), a
finding observed in our own previous research (e.g., Gruber and
Yurgelun-Todd, 2005; Gruber et al., 2012a; Sagar et al., 2015).
A number of critical factors may account for the differences
between our current findings in MMJ patients relative to findings
from recreational MJ consumers. The majority of studies of
recreational MJ use have included adolescent and young adult
populations. Overwhelmingly, studies have demonstrated that
early/adolescent onset of recreational MJ use is related to
poorer task performance and changes in brain structure and
function (Lisdahl et al., 2013, 2014; Jacobus and Tapert, 2014;
Levine et al., 2017). Given that participants in the current
sample are adults (Mean age = 50.64) who are well-beyond
the critical stages of neurodevelopment (Giedd et al., 1999),
they are likely less vulnerable to the adverse neural effects of
THC. Interestingly, recent preclinical evidence indicates that
THC may have the potential to improve cognition in older
individuals (Bilkei-Gorzo et al., 2017). Mature and old mice
administered low doses of THC demonstrated a reversal of
age-related cognitive decline, hypothesized to be related to
upregulation of the aging endocannabinoid system via increased
signaling secondary to low dose THC exposure. Moreover,

the same exposure resulted in cognitive decrements among
young mice. Additional research is needed to more fully
understand the mechanisms underlying these improvements
and to examine the impact of cannabis and cannabinoids in
older adult populations as well as the effects of low doses
of THC, as these factors likely influence the impact of MJ
use.
It is also important to consider patterns of MJ use, including
frequency and duration of use, in order to understand potential
reasons for the different outcomes among recreational users
and medical patients. In the current study, all patients reported
using MMJ at least weekly; on average, they reported using
5 days per week and 1–
2 times per day. Traditionally,
studies of recreational users have examined chronic, heavy
use;
although
criteria
for
“
heavy
use” can
vary
across
investigations, most studies have required participants to
use MJ at least 1–
4 days per week (Tait et al., 2011; Gruber
et al., 2012a; Macher and Earleywine, 2012; Dougherty et al.,
2013; Cousijn et al., 2014), similar to the frequency of use
among the current sample of medical patients. Given these
similarities, it is unlikely that differences between recreational
and MMJ patients are solely attributable to frequency of
use. Additionally, studies of recreational MJ users typically
include consumers with a longer duration of MJ use relative
to the current sample of MMJ patients, and differences in
cumulative exposure should also be considered. For this
reason, our ongoing study is designed to examine MMJ
users after increasingly longer periods of use to explore
the impact of longer durations of MMJ use on cognitive
function.
Further, MMJ patients and recreational MJ users also typically
differ in terms of the products they use. Recreational MJ
products are often prized for high THC levels, and the
goal of the recreational consumer is to change their current
state of being or to ‘
get high.’MMJ patients seek symptom
alleviation and tend to choose products with rich and varied
cannabinoid profiles including constituents other than THC,
which may also impact clinical state, cognitive processing and
other domains. For example, CBD, which has been touted
for its clinical benefits (Rong et al., 2017), has demonstrated
efficacy in mitigating the negative cognitive effects of THC
(Yücel et al., 2016) and appears to exert opposite effects
on task-related brain activation relative to THC (Colizzi and
Bhattacharyya, 2017). In addition, although there is a paucity
of research in this area, some studies have examined the direct
impact of acute CBD administration on cognitive performance.
Englund et al. (2013) reported that administration of CBD
prior to the administration of THC resulted in better episodic
memory relative to placebo pre-treatment in healthy controls.
Morgan et al. (2010) examined verbal memory performance
in current recreational MJ users and found that those using
products without CBD (confirmed by hair sample analysis)
performed more poorly on verbal memory measures than
those with detectable levels of CBD. While no studies have
examined the impact of whole plant-derived MMJ products or
assessed the long-term impact of MMJ treatment, some studies
have utilized fMRI techniques to examine the acute effects of
individual cannabinoids. Borgwardt et al. (2008) studied the
acute impact of THC, CBD, and placebo on executive function
in healthy controls using a Go/No go task. Although the
authors did not report any performance differences between
cannabinoids or placebo, fMRI data demonstrated that THC
reduced activation in frontal and anterior cingulate regions,
while CBD reduced activation in temporal and insular regions
relative to placebo. In addition, Bhattacharyya et al. (2010)
found that intravenous administration of THC and CBD
resulted in opposite effects on brain activation patterns across
multiple regions during the completion of memory, inhibitory
function, and affective measures. Given these findings, data
from the present study may reflect the direct neurobiologic
effects of cannabinoids, as increased endocannabinoid signaling
is associated with improved cognition (Egerton et al., 2006),
reduced stress response, emotional regulation, and increased
endogenous reward signaling (Hill and McEwen, 2010; Befort,
2015), and as previously noted, specific alterations in brain
activation patterns (Borgwardt et al., 2008; Bhattacharyya
et al., 2010). Results may also reflect the indirect impact
of whole plant-derived products, which include an array of
cannabinoid constituents, and may exert downstream affects
on multiple receptor types and neural systems (i.e., pain
and reward circuitry). While THC and CBD are generally
the most abundant cannabinoids in patients’products, and
as noted, several studies have begun to explore their impact
on cognition and brain activation patterns, a number of
other cannabinoids including cannabigerol (CBG), cannabinol
(CBN), cannabichromene (CBC), and tetrahydrocannabidivarin
(THCV), are often present in MMJ products, and may have
moderated or indirectly affected the impact typically associated
with THC exposure (Englund et al., 2016). Further research is
clearly indicated for assessing the specific impact of individual
cannabinoids on cognitive and clinical variables in patients using
cannabis for medical purposes.
Limitations and Future Directions
Despite the compelling nature of the study findings, several
limitations must be noted. First, the current investigation
is designed as an observational, longitudinal pre–
post study
in which patients choose their own products and treatment
regimen. The ability to assess the impact of whole plant-derived
cannabis-based products is more ecologically valid than studies
involving synthetic or non-plant derived products; however,
the current legal landscape prohibits the use of dispensary-
based products within a clinical trial model and allows only
the use of products supplied by the National Institute on
Drug Abuse (NIDA). While NIDA’
s drug supply program
has expanded their portfolio of MJ products available for
research, their supply does not currently include the range
and scope of products (i.e., product type, potency, constituent
profiles, etc.) that patients are seeking and obtaining through
dispensaries and caregivers across the nation. Accordingly, as
a clinical trial model could not be utilized, the present study
collected comprehensive data on product source, selection,
dose, frequency, and mode of use. Further, as previously
noted, patients also provided a sample of their most frequently

MMJ fMRI and Executive Function
used MMJ products for cannabinoid constituent profiling.
Interestingly, 13 of the 22 patients (59%) in the current
study were identified as taking products high in CBD which
may have contributed to study findings given previous data
highlighting its clinical benefits (McGuire et al., 2017; Rong
et al., 2017). As initial laboratory analyses revealed a range
of cannabinoid constituents from patients’
products, additional
analyses will be conducted to examine the impact of specific
cannabinoids and their relationship with cognitive and clinical
variables. Further, future studies will assess potential differences
between patients who choose products high in THC compared
to those using products high in CBD, as these data may
provide critical information regarding efficacy of individual
constituents and combinations of constituents for specific
indications and conditions to better inform selection of MMJ
products.
The current study utilized a pre–
post, within-subjects design
in which all patients are MJ naïve at Visit 1 and are followed
over the course of 12–
24 months in order to clarify the impact
of prolonged duration of exposure to MMJ treatment. As results
from the current study represent only data from baseline and
patients’first check-in visit after 3 months of MMJ treatment,
data must be considered preliminary. Additional analyses, which
are planned for the future, are needed to understand the
impact of MMJ over longer treatment periods. Further, as a
result of the pre–
post study design, repeated administration
of cognitive measures was required, and thus practice effects
cannot be completely ruled out. Although no studies to date
have specifically examined practice effects for the MSIT, given
the lengthy duration of time between visits (at least 3 months)
and the computerized nature of the task, it is highly unlikely that
practice effects would persist. In addition, given the longitudinal
nature of the design, each subject’
s baseline assessment serves as
their own control from which to assess change after initiation
of MMJ treatment. It could, however, prove beneficial for future
investigations to also recruit a control group of patients who
report similar symptoms (i.e., pain, insomnia, anxiety, etc.)
but who do not choose to utilize MMJ. Comparing outcomes
of MMJ patients and “
treatment as usual”patients over time
could strengthen findings if MMJ patients display more positive
outcomes relative to those who do not use MMJ but suffer from
similar symptoms or conditions.
In addition, statistical thresholds for fMRI analyses were set
in accordance with previous investigations (Shin et al., 2011;
Gruber et al., 2012a; Harding et al., 2012) in order to aid in the
interpretation of findings. While more stringent thresholds were
also applied and are noted within the results, it is important to
recognize that some findings did not survive the more rigorous
thresholds, a common issue in fMRI studies with limited sample
sizes.
In order to gain a more thorough understanding of how
MMJ impacts cognitive functioning, it will be important for
future studies to replicate current study findings using other
measures of executive function and to examine additional
cognitive domains. As executive functioning has been shown to
be impacted by recreational MJ use (for review, Crean et al.,
2011), this domain was targeted for the current investigation;
however, it is crucial to examine additional cognitive variables,
including verbal memory, which has also been shown to be
sensitive to MJ use (for review, Solowij and Battisti, 2008; Broyd
et al., 2016).
Finally, this study included MMJ patients using products
for a variety of indications, which resulted in a varied clinical
sample. While this approach provides a broad assessment of
the impact of MMJ, it is likely that individual conditions and
symptoms will have unique patterns of responses associated
with MMJ treatment. A number of medical and psychiatric
conditions have been shown to negatively impact cognitive
processing; accordingly, future studies may derive additional
power by limiting inclusion to patients with a single condition
or indication (i.e., patients using MMJ exclusively for pain) or
including only patients taking medications from a single drug
class.
CONCLUSION
To our knowledge, this study represents the first neuroimaging
investigation of patients using marijuana for medical purposes.
Following 3 months of MMJ treatment, brain activation
patterns appear more similar to those exhibited by healthy
controls from previous studies than at pre-treatment. This
finding provides strong evidence that MMJ treatment may
normalize brain activity. Importantly, these changes were
accompanied by improved task performance as well as positive
changes in ratings of clinical state, impulsivity, sleep, and
quality of life. Further, patients reported notable decreases
in their use of conventional medications, including opioids.
In light of the national opioid epidemic, these data clearly
underscore the need to expand and extend this study to
determine if a reduction in opioid use persists with continued
MMJ treatment. Results from the current study raise the
possibility that the observed improvements in cognition and
related changes in functional activation patterns may be
related to direct and/or indirect effects of cannabinoids,
specifically within an adult population beyond the stages of
critical neuromaturation. Patients utilizing MMJ appear to
use products with different cannabinoid profiles (i.e., high
CBD) relative to recreational users, which is also likely
to impact cognitive function. Observed changes may also
be related to secondary or more indirect effects, including
the reduction of clinical symptoms, improved sleep, and
decreased use of conventional medications. Additional studies
using both observational and clinical trial models to examine
the impact of actual MMJ products used by patients are
needed to clarify the underlying neural mechanisms associated
with clinical and behavioral changes that accompany MMJ
treatment.
