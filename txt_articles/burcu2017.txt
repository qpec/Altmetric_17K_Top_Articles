IMPORTANCE Antidepressants are one of the most commonly prescribed classes of
psychotropic medications among US youths. For adults, there is emerging evidence on the
increased risk of type 2 diabetes in association with antidepressant use. However, little is
known about the antidepressant treatment–emergent risk of type 2 diabetes among youths.
OBJECTIVE To assess the association between antidepressant use and the risk of incident
type 2 diabetes in youths by antidepressant subclass and according to duration of use,
cumulative dose, and average daily dose.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A retrospective cohort study was conducted using
Medicaid claims data from 4 geographically diverse, large states of youths 5 to 20 years of
age who initiated antidepressant treatment from January 1, 2005, to December 31, 2009.
EXPOSURES Antidepressant use (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs] or
serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors [SNRIs], tricyclic or other cyclic
antidepressants, and other antidepressants) was assessed using the following 4 time-varying
measures: current or former use, duration of use, cumulative dose, and average daily dose.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Incident type 2 diabetes was assessed using discrete-time
failure models, adjusting for disease risk score estimated using more than 125 baseline and
time-dependent covariates.
RESULTS In this cohort of 119 608 youths aged 5 to 20 years who initiated antidepressant
treatment (59 087 female youths and 60 521 male youths; 54.7% between 5 and 14 years of
age) with a mean follow-up of 22.8 months, 79 285 [66.3%] had SSRI or SNRI exposure. The
risk of type 2 diabetes was significantly greater during current use than former use of SSRIs
or SNRIs (absolute risk, 1.29 per 10 000 person-months vs 0.64 per 10 000 person-months;
adjusted relative risk [RR], 1.88; 95% CI, 1.34-2.64) and tricyclic or other cyclic
antidepressants (absolute risk, 0.89 per 10 000 person-months vs 0.48 per 10 000
person-months; RR, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.06-4.36), but not of other antidepressants (absolute
risk, 1.15 per 10 000 person-months vs 1.12 per 10 000 person-months; RR, 0.99; 95% CI,
0.66-1.50). Furthermore, for youths currently using SSRIs or SNRIs, the risk of type 2 diabetes
increased with the duration of use (RR, 2.66; 95% CI, 1.45-4.88 for >210 days and RR, 2.56;
95% CI, 1.29-5.08 for 151-210 days compared with 1-90 days) and with the cumulative dose
(RR, 2.44; 95% CI, 1.35-4.43 for >4500 mg and RR, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.07-4.40 for 3001-4500 mg
compared with 1-1500 mg in fluoxetine hydrochloride dose equivalents). By contrast, neither
the duration nor the cumulative dose of other antidepressants was associated with an
increased risk of type 2 diabetes. The risk of type 2 diabetes increased significantly with the
average daily dose among youths with more than 150 days of SSRI or SNRI use (RR, 2.39;
95% CI, 1.04-5.52 for >15.0 vs �15.0 mg/d) but not among youths with 1 to 150 days of SSRI
or SNRI use.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In a large cohort of youths insured by Medicaid, the use of
SSRIs or SNRIs—the most commonly used antidepressant subclass—was associated with an
increased risk of type 2 diabetes that intensified with increasing duration of use, cumulative
dose, and average daily dose.

ntidepressants are one of the most commonly pre-
scribed psychotropic medication classes among US
youths.1,2 In the past 2 decades, there has been a
marked increase in the percentage of US children and adoles-
centswhouseantidepressants(from1.5%in1996-1998to2.6%
in 2010-2012).1 This expansion of antidepressant use among
youths was driven largely by a significantly more rapid in-
crease in antidepressants prescribed to youths by pediatri-
cians and other primary care physicians than by psychiatrists.3
For youths, several antidepressants have evidence-based in-
dications approved by the US Food and Drug Administration,
such as major depressive disorder, obsessive-compulsive dis-
order, and childhood enuresis,4 but their off-label use among
youths is also not uncommon, which is a subject of concern
and debate.5,6
During the past decade, there has been a growing num-
ber of published studies—all conducted for adults—that re-
port a substantially increased risk of type 2 diabetes associ-
ated with antidepressant use.7-14 By contrast, evidence of such
a risk among youths is scarce and limited to only a few
studies,15,16 wherein antidepressant use concomitant with an-
tipsychotics was associated with an additive increased risk of
type 2 diabetes. To our knowledge, no population-based study
has comprehensively examined the independent effect of an-
tidepressants on the risk of incident type 2 diabetes among
youths.

insured by Medicaid who initiated treatment with antidepres-
sants, and we assessed the risk of incident type 2 diabetes by
antidepressant subclass and according to duration of use and
cumulative dose. Subsequently, in a secondary analysis, we as-
sessed the risk of type 2 diabetes according to the average daily
dose and examined the interaction between the duration of
use and the average daily dose for selective serotonin reup-
take inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake
inhibitors (SNRIs), the leading antidepressant subclass.17
Methods
Data Source
The Medicaid Analytic eXtract (MAX) database was obtained
toanalyzecomputerizedadministrativeclaimfilesfrom4large,
geographically diverse states—California, Florida, Illinois, and
New Jersey—from January 1, 2004, through December 31,
2009.18 Medicaid administrative claims data include enroll-
ment files and claim files for inpatient and outpatient ser-
vices and prescription drug dispensings. The enrollment files
contain data on monthly enrollment, eligibility status, and so-
ciodemographic characteristics. An encrypted identification
number was assigned to each enrollee to link enrollment files
to inpatient, outpatient, and prescription drug claim files. The
inpatient and outpatient claim files contain information at the
claim level, including diagnosis and procedure codes. The pre-
scription drug claim file includes information on dispensing
date,daysofsupply,quantityofsupply,andnationaldrugcode,
which was used to identify the name, strength, dosage form,
and formulation of dispensed products. This study was re-
viewed and approved by the University of Maryland institu-
tional review board. As this is a retrospective study with no
patient contact and deidentified patient information, no pa-
tient consent was needed.
Study Design and Population
In this retrospective cohort study, the study population com-
prised youths insured by Medicaid who were 5 to 20 years of
age. To attenuate prevalent user bias,19,20 a new-user design
was applied by restricting the study cohort to those who ini-
tiated treatment with antidepressant medications (SSRIs or
SNRIs, tricyclic or other cyclic antidepressants [TCAs], and
other antidepressants) from January 1, 2005, through Decem-
ber 31, 2009 (eTable 1 in the Supplement).
The flowchart in Figure 1 illustrates the inclusion and ex-
clusion criteria that were applied to define the study cohort
of 119 608 youths who initiated antidepressant treatment. The
antidepressant initiation date served as the index date for co-
hort entry. New users of antidepressants were selected by ex-
cluding youths who received antidepressant medications dur-
ing the 365 days preceding the index date. In addition, we
excluded youths who were partially enrolled during the 365
days preceding the index date. Youths were also excluded if
theyhadanenrollmentinacomprehensiveorbehavioralman-
aged care plan in Florida because of concerns about the qual-
ity of managed care data from Florida. To ensure that there
would be an active contact with the health care system, youths
were required to have at least 2 outpatient visits (on separate
days) in the 365 days prior to the index date. Other criteria (an
admission to a long-term care facility or hospice care and a di-
agnosis of a life-threatening or serious somatic condition
[eTable 2 in the Supplement]) were applied to exclude youths
who might have received frequent care in noncommunity set-
tings. Because gestational diabetes is common during preg-
nancy and oral antidiabetic medications (eg, metformin) are
frequently used to treat women with polycystic ovarian
syndrome,21 these cases were excluded. Finally, because the
main objective of the study was to assess incident type 2 dia-
betes, youths were excluded if they had a diabetes-related in-
Key Points
Question Does antidepressant use increase the risk of incident
type 2 diabetes among youths?
Findings In a cohort study of youths insured by Medicaid that
included 119 608 youths who initiated antidepressant treatment,
the current use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or
serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors—the most
commonly used antidepressant subclass—was associated with an
increased risk of incident type 2 diabetes that intensified with
increasing duration of use, cumulative dose, and average daily
dose.
Meaning The study findings provide an impetus to improve
monitoring for benefits vs risks of antidepressant use in pediatric
care models and to shed light on the underlying biological
mechanism of antidepressant treatment–emergent type 2
diabetes.

 patient or outpatient claim or an antidiabetic medication dis-
pensed during the 365-day period prior to the index date.
Incident Type 2 Diabetes
The main study outcome was diagnosis of incident type 2 dia-
betes, which was identified by the use of a validated, comput-
erized database algorithm. This algorithm—validated in a co-
hort of youths insured by Medicaid—had a positive predictive
value of 83.9%.22 In brief, new cases of diabetes were identi-
fied from inpatient stays or outpatient visits with a diabetes
diagnosis (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revi-
sion,ClinicalModificationcodes250,250.0,250.1,250.2,250.3,
and 250.9), as well as the dispensing of antidiabetic medica-
tions (insulin, insulin adjuncts, or oral hypoglycemic agents).
To meet the case definition of diabetes, we required an inpa-
tient stay with a primary diagnosis of diabetes or a combina-
tion of 2 or more different diabetes-related medical care en-
counters (ie, an outpatient visit with a primary diagnosis of
diabetes, an inpatient stay with a diagnosis [any] of diabetes,
or the dispensing of an antidiabetic medication) within a 120-
day period. The initial diagnosis date of diabetes was re-
corded as the date for the initial diabetes-related medical care
encounter. Youths were excluded from meeting the case defi-
nition if they had a polycystic ovarian syndrome–related medi-
cal encounter within 120 days of the diagnosis date of diabe-
tes. Cases were considered type 1 diabetes if insulin was the
sole treatment within 120 days of the diagnosis date of diabe-
tes. Otherwise, the cases were considered type 2 diabetes.
Theincidenceoftype2diabeteswasexpressedasthenum-
ber of new cases of type 2 diabetes per 10 000 person-
months of follow-up. Youths in the study were followed up un-
til the incident type 2 diabetes, their 21st birthday, the end of
continuous enrollment in the state Medicaid programs, or the
end of the study (December 31, 2009), whichever came first.
During follow-up, youths were also censored if they had a dia-
betes-relatedmedicalcareencounterthatdidnotmeetthecase
definition of type 2 diabetes (ie, type 1 diabetes, having a dis-
pensing of an antidiabetic medication in the absence of a dia-
betes diagnosis, or having a polycystic ovarian syndrome–
relatedmedicalencounterwithin120daysofthediagnosisdate
of diabetes).
Antidepressant Medication Use
In this cohort of youths who initiated antidepressant treat-
ment, medication use was operationalized using 4 time-
dependent measures, which accounted for status of use (cur-
rent vs former use), duration of use (in days), cumulative dose
exposure, and average daily dose. Medication use was con-
sidered current if medications were not discontinued for more
than 90 days. The rationale for the 90-day time period was to
account for carryover effects23 and to allow a reasonable time
window for the latency or detection of antidepressant treat-
ment–emergent type 2 diabetes. Medication use was consid-
ered former if medications were discontinued for more than
90 days. Of note, we also conducted a sensitivity analysis in
which we did not require the 90-day time window to account
for the carryover effects.
The duration of use was calculated in each month of fol-
low-up as the sum of the total days of supply that were avail-
able starting from the cohort entry date (index date). Al-
though the 90-day time period was applied to account for
carryover effects in categorizing months of current use, the
duration-of-use measure was calculated solely using the days
of supply information. Similarly, the cumulative dose was cal-
culated as the sum of total dosage that was available starting
from the index date. To set comparable doses across antide-
pressant medications, the cumulative dosage was calculated
in fluoxetine dosage equivalents (in milligrams) (eTable 3 in
the Supplement). The dose conversion factors were adapted
from previously published clinical research.24,25 Finally, the
average daily dose (milligrams per day) for current users was
calculated (in a time-dependent manner) as the cumulative
dose (in fluoxetine equivalents) divided by the duration of use.
Statistical Analysis
All analyses were conducted using SAS, version 9.3 (SAS In-
stitute Inc). Discrete-time failure models were used to assess
the adjusted incidence of type 2 diabetes. The unit of analy-

 sis in these models was person-months. Discrete-time analy-
ses provide computational efficiency and practical advan-
tages over Cox proportional hazards regression models when
there are multiple time-dependent medication exposure
groups.26,27
To adjust for confounding, we identified more than 125
baseline and time-dependent covariates that encompassed a
wide range of sociodemographic, administrative, and re-
gional characteristics; psychiatric and nonpsychiatric clinical
characteristics; and health care use characteristics (eTable 4
in the Supplement). Because of the high volume of study co-
variates, we used the disease risk score method to generate a
confounder summary score. The disease risk score method—
like the propensity score method—allows for parsimonious
models but provides advantages over the propensity score
when multiple time-dependent main exposure groups are
present.28-30 Because the study cohort was nested in a cohort
of youths who initiated antidepressant treatment, we used the
Miettinen full cohort approach31,32 to calculate the disease risk
score, which was estimated as the probability of incident type
2 diabetes conditional on study covariates. The disease risk
score was estimated in a time-dependent manner for each per-
son in each month of follow-up.
The final regression models that assessed the risk of type
2 diabetes according to antidepressant exposure groups were
adjusted for time-dependent disease risk score, expressed as
percentile rank groups (eFigure in the Supplement), and time
from the index date. First, we assessed the risk of type 2 dia-
betes during current vs former use of antidepressants, as well
as each antidepressant subclass. Subsequent analyses were re-
stricted to current users to evaluate the risk of type 2 diabetes
according to duration of use and dose.
The duration-response and dose-response analyses were
notconductedforTCAsowingtolowfrequencyofuse.Forcur-
rent users of SSRIs or SNRIs, we assessed the risk of type 2 dia-
betes according to the duration of SSRI or SNRI use and the cu-
mulativeSSRIorSNRIdose.Similarly,forcurrentusersofother
antidepressants, we assessed the risk of type 2 diabetes ac-
cording to the duration of use and the cumulative dose of other
antidepressants.
Furthermore, we conducted secondary analyses to ex-
plore whether the average daily dose would be associated with
the risk of type 2 diabetes for SSRIs or SNRIs, the leading an-
tidepressant subclass. Also, we assessed whether the risk of
type 2 diabetes associated with the average daily dose differs
according to the duration of use (ie, the interaction between
the average daily dose and the duration of use).
We conducted several subgroup and sensitivity analyses.
We conducted an analysis of older youths (10-20 years of age)
wherein antidepressant use was most prevalent.1,17 In an-
other analysis, we did not require the 90-day time window to
account for the carryover effects. Moreover, we excluded
youths who used any other psychotropic medication prior to
theindexdate.Thelatteranalysis(inpsychotropicmedication–
naive youth) attempted to attenuate confounding by disease
severity because prior use of other classes of psychotropic
medicationscouldsuggestgreaterseverityofapsychiatriccon-
dition.Finally,toattenuateconfoundingbyindication,wecon-
ducted an analysis by restricting the cohort to youths with a
diagnosis of depressive disorders.
Results
Characteristics of the Study Cohort
The study cohort comprised 119 608 youths aged 5 to 20 years
who initiated treatment with antidepressants from 2005
through 2009 (Table 1). The study cohort largely represented
youths who were between 10 and 17 years of age (83 122
[69.5%]), nonwhite (64 170 [53.7%]), and eligible for Medic-
aid based on low family income (81 219 [67.9%]). Male and
female youths were equally represented.
In rank order, the most common clinician-reported psy-
chiatric diagnoses were depressive disorders (44 753 [37.4%]),
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (30 975 [25.9%]), and
anxiety disorders (21 189 [17.7%]). Most of the study cohort
(77 210 [64.6%]) did not have a dispensing of any other psy-
chiatric medication class in the year prior to antidepressant
initiation.
The study cohort had a mean follow-up of 22.8 months
(median, 19.0 months; interquartile range, 9.0-35.0 months).
During follow-up, SSRIs and SNRIs (79 285 [66.3%]) were the
most commonly used antidepressant subclass with a mean du-
ration of 179.7 days (median, 90.0 days; interquartile range,
30.0-213.0 days) (eTable 5 in the Supplement). The use of an-
tidepressants that were not SSRIs or SNRIs, particularly TCAs
(22 143 [18.5%]), was less common.
Risk of Incident Type 2 Diabetes
During follow-up, there were 233 incident cases of type 2 dia-
betes, of which 156 occurred during current use (absolute risk,
1.16 per 10 000 person-months) and 77 occurred during for-
mer use of antidepressants (absolute risk, 0.56 per 10 000 per-
son-months) (Table 2). Overall, when compared with former
use, current use of antidepressants was associated with a 1.92-
fold increased risk of type 2 diabetes (95% CI, 1.43-fold to 2.57-
fold increased risk). The risk of type 2 diabetes according to
current vs former use differed by antidepressant medication
subclass (in terms of both absolute risk and relative risk [RR]
estimates). Compared with former use, current use of SSRIs
or SNRIs (absolute risk, 1.29 per 10 000 person-months vs 0.64
per10 000person-months;RR,1.88;95%CI,1.34-2.64)orTCAs
(absolute risk, 0.89 per 10 000 person-months vs 0.48 per
10 000 person-months; RR, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.06-4.36) was as-
sociated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. By con-
trast, current use of other antidepressants was not signifi-
cantly associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes
compared with former use (absolute risk, 1.15 per 10 000 per-
son-months vs 1.12 per 10 000 person-months; RR, 0.99; 95%
CI, 0.66-1.50).
Furthermore, for youths currently using SSRIs or SNRIs,
the risk of type 2 diabetes intensified with increasing dura-
tion of SSRI or SNRI use, with an RR of 2.66 (95% CI, 1.45-
4.88) for more than 210 days of use and an RR of 2.56 (95%
CI, 1.29-5.08) for 151 to 210 days of use compared with 1 to 90
days of use (Table 3). By contrast, for current users of other

 antidepressants, the duration of use was not significantly
associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes.
Similar significant findings were observed when the risk
of type 2 diabetes was assessed according to the cumulative
dose. For youths currently using SSRIs or SNRIs, the risk of
type 2 diabetes intensified with increasing cumulative dose
(in fluoxetine hydrochloride dose equivalents) (Table 3).
Compared with youths with a 1- to 1500-mg cumulative SSRI
or SNRI dose exposure, there was a 2.44-fold increased risk
(95% CI, 1.35- to 4.43-fold increased risk) of type 2 diabetes
among youths with more than a 4500-mg SSRI or SNRI
cumulative dose and a 2.17-fold increased risk (95% CI, 1.07-
to 4.40-fold increased risk) of type 2 diabetes among youths
with a 3001- to 4500-mg cumulative SSRI or SNRI dose. By
contrast, for youths who were currently using other antide-
pressants, the cumulative dose was not significantly associ-
ated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes.
Finally,becauseboththedurationandthecumulativedose
were associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes in
youths currently using SSRIs or SNRIs, we explored the inter-
action between the duration of use and the average daily dose
on the risk of type 2 diabetes (Figure 2). Overall, for youths cur-
rently using SSRIs or SNRIs, the risk of type 2 diabetes in-
creased significantly with the average daily dose (in fluoxetine
hydrochloride dose equivalents), with an RR of 1.96 (95% CI,
1.05-3.64) for more than 30.0 mg/d and an RR of 1.83 (95% CI,
1.04-3.24)for15.1to30.0mg/dcomparedwith15.0mg/dorless.
However, the risk of type 2 diabetes associated with the aver-
agedailydosedifferedaccordingtothedurationofSSRIorSNRI
use. There was a significant interaction between the duration
of SSRI or SNRI use and the average daily SSRI or SNRI dose on
the risk of type 2 diabetes. For youths with more than 150 days
of SSRI or SNRI use, more than 15.0 mg/d was associated with

Sensitivity and Subgroup Analyses
The risk of incident type 2 diabetes remained elevated dur-
ing current use of SSRIs or SNRIs compared with former
SSRI or SNRI use across all the subgroup and sensitivity
analyses (eTable 6 in the Supplement): (1) for youths 10 to
20 years of age (RR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.32-2.60), (2) when the
90-day time window was not allowed to account for carry-
over effects (RR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.30-2.43), (3) when youths
with any psychotropic medication use prior to the index
date were excluded (RR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.18-2.99), and (4) for
youths with a diagnosis of depressive disorders (RR, 2.73;
95% CI, 1.64-4.56). By contrast, there was no significant dif-
ference in the risk of type 2 diabetes between current and
former use of other antidepressants in all the listed sub-
group and sensitivity analyses, consistent with the main
study findings.

 Discussion
In this large cohort of youths insured by Medicaid who initi-
ated treatment with antidepressant medications, our main
finding indicates that there was a substantially greater risk of
incident type 2 diabetes for those currently using SSRIs or
SNRIs than for those who formerly used these medications.
Furthermore, for youths currently using SSRIs or SNRIs, the
risk of type 2 diabetes intensified with increasing duration of
use, cumulative dose, and average daily dose. The increased
risk was most apparent for youths with long-term SSRI or SNRI
use at higher average daily doses. Current use of TCAs was also
associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. By con-
trast, current use of other antidepressants was not associated
with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Moreover, for pa-
tients currently using other antidepressants, neither dura-
tion nor cumulative dose was associated with an increased risk
of type 2 diabetes.
There is a dearth of published reports examining the risk
of type 2 diabetes associated with pediatric use of antidepres-
sants.Toourknowledge,thisisthefirstpopulation-basedstudy
of youths that comprehensively examines the risk of incident
type 2 diabetes following treatment initiation with an antide-
pressant. Previous population-based studies reported that,
among youths insured by Medicaid who were treated with an-
tipsychotics, concomitant antidepressant use was associated
with an increased risk of incident type 2 diabetes.15,16 In an-
other study also focused on antipsychotics,33 there was a sta-
tistically increased risk of incident type 2 diabetes among
youths treated with antipsychotics when compared with those
who did not use psychotropic medications but not when com-
pared with youths treated with antidepressants.
There is a growing number of studies7-14 of adults that cor-
roborate the increased risk observed in our study. For ex-
ample, long-term use of SSRIs in moderate to high daily doses
by adults was associated with an increased risk of type 2
diabetes.7 Adult studies also suggest that long-term use of an-
tidepressants, particularly those with a high affinity for sero-
tonin receptors, may be associated with increased weight gain,
albeit not substantially.8,34,35 Mechanisms other than weight
gain may play a greater role in serotonin reuptake inhibitor
treatment-emergent type 2 diabetes, including disturbances
in glucose homeostasis,36 decreased pancreatic insulin
secretion,12,37 and increased cellular insulin resistance.38 Nev-
ertheless, much remains to be elucidated about the biologi-
cal pathway for incident type 2 diabetes following antidepres-
sant use among youths.
Strengths and Limitations
In this large cohort of youths insured by Medicaid, we used a
new-user design to mitigate prevalent user bias,20 and we used
a previously validated algorithm to assess incident type 2
diabetes.22 Also, we nested our study solely in a cohort of
youths who initiated antidepressant treatment wherein the in-
cidence of type 2 diabetes was assessed according to current
vs former use (rather than comparing users vs nonusers). This
approach aimed to attenuate bias due to unmeasured con-
founding since current users should be more similar to for-
mer users than to nonusers regarding factors associated with
antidepressant use.39-41 In addition, for current users, we con-
ducted duration-response and dose-response analyses, all of
which provided consistent estimates for SSRIs and SNRIs
(significantly increased risk) and other antidepressants (no sig-
nificantly increased risk). Several limitations should also be
noted. First, causality cannot be inferred from observational
studies; thus, the study findings should be interpreted with
caution. Nevertheless, the study used a rigorous design and
rigorousstatisticalapproachestoaccountforconfounding,and
it provides new information on the risk of a rare, but serious,
adverse outcome that is often difficult to assess in random-
ized clinical trials owing to limited sample size and inad-
equate follow-up.42 Second, drug dispensings are not com-
mensurate with actual use, but the emphasis on duration and
cumulative dose increases the likelihood of actual use. Third,
duration-response and dose-response analyses could not be
conducted for TCAs or for individual drugs owing to limited
exposure, but the study provides compelling safety informa-
tion for SSRIs and SNRIs, the major antidepressant subclass.
Finally, previous research on adults suggests that depres-
sion, in itself, may be associated with weight gain, which
may, in turn, increase the likelihood of developing type 2
diabetes.8,43 However, in the present study, most youths who
initiated antidepressant treatment (74 855 [62.6%]) did not
have a clinician-reported diagnosis of depressive disorders. A
large majority of youths who initiated antidepressant treat-

The risk of type 2 diabetes increased significantly with the average daily dose
(in fluoxetine hydrochloride dose equivalents), with a relative risk [RR] of

1.04-3.24) for 15.1 to 30.0 mg/d compared with 15.0 mg/d or less. For youths
with 1 to 150 days of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or
serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) use, the average daily
dose was not significantly associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes
(RR, 1.22; 95% CI, 0.57-2.63). For youths with more than 150 days of SSRI or
SNRI use, more than 15.0 mg/d was associated with a 2.39-fold (95% CI, 1.04-
to 5.52-fold) increased risk of type 2 diabetes compared with 15.0 mg/d or less.
Relative risk is adjusted for disease risk score (expressed as percentile ranks),
time from cohort entry (ie, follow-up month), and exposures to tricyclic and
other related cyclic antidepressants and other antidepressants. Error bars
indicate 95% CIs.

 ment had a clinician-reported psychiatric diagnosis other than
depression. Also, compared with antipsychotics (a drug class
knowntoinduceweightgain),treatment-emergentweightgain
with SSRIs or SNRIs appears to be more limited.8,34 Further-
more, to attenuate confounding by indication, when the study
cohort was limited to youth diagnosed with depressive disor-
ders, the findings were consistent with the main study re-
sults (eTable 6 in the Supplement).
Conclusions
In a large cohort of youths insured by Medicaid, the use of
SSRIs and SNRIs was associated with an increased risk of type
2 diabetes, which intensified with increasing duration of use,
cumulative dose, and average daily dose. The increased risk
was particularly prominent for long-term use of SSRIs or
SNRIs that occurred in greater daily doses. In the face of re-
centgrowthinthepediatricuseofantidepressantsintheUnited
States,aswellasotherWesterncountries,17,44thefindingsfrom
this study support the need for further research to shed light
on the underlying biological mechanism of treatment-
emergenttype2diabetesassociatedwithantidepressants.Also,
given that more than half of antidepressant prescriptions to
US youths occur in outpatient visits to pediatricians and other
primary care physicians,3 the study findings provide an im-
petus for policy development to improve monitoring for the
benefits vs risks of antidepressant use in pediatric care mod-
els,specificallyforserotoninreuptakeinhibitors,themostcom-
monly used antidepressant subclass.
