SUMMARY
The encoding of information into long-term declara-
tive memory is facilitated by dopamine. This process
depends on hippocampal novelty signals, but it re-
mains unknown how midbrain dopaminergic neu-
rons are modulated by declarative-memory-based
information. We recorded individual substantia nigra
(SN) neurons and cortical field potentials in human
patients performing a recognition memory task. We
found that 25% of SN neurons were modulated by
stimulus novelty. Extracellular waveform shape and
anatomical location indicated that these memory-se-
lective neurons were putatively dopaminergic. The
responses of memory-selective neurons appeared
527 ms after stimulus onset, changed after a single
trial, and were indicative of recognition accuracy.
SN neurons phase locked to frontal cortical theta-fre-
quency oscillations, and the extent of this coordina-
tion predicted successful memory formation. These
data reveal that dopaminergic neurons in the human
SN are modulated by memory signals and demon-
strate a progression of information flow in the hippo-
campal-basal ganglia-frontal cortex loop for memory
encoding.
INTRODUCTION
The formation of declarative memories relies on the ability of
hippocampal synapses to rapidly change their strength through
long-term potentiation and depression [1]. The strength and
duration of synaptic plasticity depends on extracellular dopa-
mine levels [2, 3], a neuromodulator that is released in the hippo-
campus from axonal terminals projecting from dopaminergic
neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) and ventral tegmental
area (VTA) [4]. The strength of hippocampal declarative mem-
ories is modulated by dopamine release: both the extent of
SN/VTA activation [5, 6] and levels of dopamine within the
hippocampus [2, 7] modulate the success of encoding. When
animals are exposed to new environments, dopamine levels
rise and facilitate long-term potentiation in the hippocampus.
This enhanced memory for novel environments, however, is
lost when hippocampal dopamine receptors are blocked [8].
Although these and other observations suggest a critical role
for dopamine released by SN/VTA neurons in declarative mem-
ory [9–11], the underlying mechanisms that regulate this
response are poorly understood.
Studying how SN/VTA dopaminergic neurons signal reward
and reward expectation errors [12–14] has revealed a mecha-
nistic understanding of the role of the SN/VTA in classical condi-
tioning and reinforcement learning [15]. In addition, in humans,
SN neurons also respond to infrequent sounds in an odd-ball
paradigm [16] and encode decision outcomes [17]. In contrast,
little is known about the role of SN/VTA in the acquisition of
declarative memories. Although SN dopaminergic neurons
respond to novel stimuli during conditioning [13, 18–20], no re-
cordings exist of SN neurons during declarative memory tasks.
It therefore remains unknown whether SN neurons differentiate
familiar from novel stimuli and whether such activation is related
to memory encoding success.
It has been proposed that the dopaminergic system and the
hippocampus form a multisynaptic loop that starts with a hippo-
campal novelty signal that transiently excites dopaminergic
neurons in the SN/VTA, which in turn leads to strengthening of
hippocampal plasticity through the activation of hippocampal
dopamine receptors (Figure 1A) [9, 23]. Although the original hy-
pothesis concerns both the SN and the VTA, our focus here is
only on the SN, and we thus restrict the following discussion to
predictions relevant to the SN. Also, we do not limit the discus-
sion to dopaminergic SN neurons, because GABAergic neurons
in turn inhibit dopaminergic (DA) neurons [24], making their
response equally relevant to the hypothesis. The hippocam-
pus-SN/VTA loop hypothesis [9, 23] makes three specific pre-
dictions with respect to declarative memories: first, it predicts
that the activity of SN neurons is modulated by stimulus novelty
during declarative memory tasks. Second, it predicts that
this modulation appears, relative to stimulus onset, first in the

 hippocampus followed by the SN. Third, if relevant for declara-
tive memory, SN activity during novel stimuli should be predic-
tive of the success or failure of memory formation as assessed
by later behavior. Here, we test these three predictions directly
in humans by recording the activity of individual SN neurons
and relating their activity to behaviorally assessed memory
strength.
Our subjects performed a recognition memory task for which
we and others have described novelty-signaling neurons in the
human hippocampus [25]. The extent to which these memory-
selective neurons are modulated by ongoing theta oscillations
is predictive of the success or failure of memory formation [26].
Dopamine is thought to be essential for the success of memory
formation in this task, raising the question whether or not the ac-
tivity of SN neurons is additionally coordinated by ongoing theta
oscillations. Theta-frequency and other low-frequency oscilla-
tions are critical in coordinating information flow between
cortical and subcortical areas [27–29], including the SN/VTA,
the hippocampus, and cortex. However, it remains unknown
whether coordination of neural activity between SN neurons
and cortex also plays a role in declarative memory formation.
Here, we simultaneously recorded the activity of SN neurons
together with cortical field potentials over the frontal lobe to
assess whether the activity of SN neurons is coordinated with
cortical activity and whether such coordination is predictive of
the success of memory formation.
RESULTS
Task and Behavior
23 subjects (28 sessions; see Table S1) undergoing implantation
of a deep-brain stimulation (DBS) device in the subthalamic nu-
cleus (STN) for the treatment of either Parkinson’s disease (PD)
or essential tremor performed a continuous recognition memory
task. Two recording sessions were excluded because subjects
performed at chance level, and three sessions were excluded
because recordings were made outside of the SN (see Figures
1D and 1E). Thus, 23 sessions remained for analysis.
Subjects were asked to view a sequence of images and to
identify each image as novel or familiar (Figure 1B). Subjects
pressed either the ‘‘new’’ or ‘‘old’’ button to provide their an-
swers (button identity was reversed in the middle of the experi-
ment). Each image was presented up to three times. The first
presentation is referred to as ‘‘novel’’ and the remaining two pre-
sentations as ‘‘familiar’’. Subjects performed well, with an
average recognition accuracy of 82% (±8%, ±SD; Figure 1C).
Also, subjects continued learning as demonstrated by a signifi-
cant performance increase during the second familiar presenta-
tion (87% ± 13%) compared to the first one (74% ± 12%, t [22] =
5.62, p = 0.0005, permutation paired t test). Only correct trials
were used for analysis unless stated otherwise. The median
time between onset of the question screen and button press
was 0.69 ± 0.99 s, with no significant difference in reaction

 time between novel (1.12 ± 1.06 s) and familiar responses (1.05 ±
0.90 s, t [22] = 1.17, p = 0.26, permutation paired t test). The
images we used each belonged to one of three different visual
categories (animals, landscapes, and fruits). There were no sig-
nificant differences in reaction time as a function of visual cate-
gory (one-way permutation ANOVA: F [2,44] = 2, p = 0.13).
Together, these behavioral data show that patients performed
the task accurately. Pre-operative neuropsychological evalua-
tion testing was consistent with this observation (see Table S1).
Electrophysiology
We identified 66 well-isolated putative single neurons recorded
from the SN. Figures 1D and 1E show the locations of all
recording sites in Talairach space as determined from stereotac-
tic coordinates (also see STAR Methods and Figures S2E and
S2F). Neurons were well isolated as assessed quantitatively us-
ing spike sorting quality metrics (Figure S1). Throughout the
manuscript, we use the terms neuron, unit, and cell interchange-
ably to refer to a putative single neuron. From each microelec-
trode, we also recorded field potentials using the low-impedance
electrode contact located 3 mm above the microelectrode tip
(Figure S2A). In addition, we recorded cortical surface (electro-
corticography [ECoG]) signals using a subdural strip electrode
placed along the dorsal fronto-parietal brain surface, extending
anterior and posterior to the central sulcus (Figures S2B–S2D).
We localized the position of the ECoG electrodes and their
related cortical areas using a combination of intraoperative im-
aging and median nerve stimulation (see STAR Methods and Fig-
ures S2C and S2D). The median location of all ECoG recordings
is shown in Figure 1F.
SN Neurons Respond to Visual Stimuli
We first tested whether neurons changed their firing rate in
response to image onset when considering all trials together,
regardless of novelty/familiarity (see STAR Methods). We found
that 14/66 (21.2%, p = 0.002, compared to null distribution; Fig-
ure 2A) of neurons changed their firing rate in response to image
onset (comparing spikes in a window 0–1.5 s following stimulus
onset with a window �0.5–0 s preceding stimulus onset). Of
these ‘‘image responsive’’ neurons, five increased their firing
rate relative to baseline (example neuron shown in Figure 2C)
and 9 decreased their firing rate (example neuron shown in
Figure 2D). The neurons that increased their firing rate re-
sponded significantly faster than those that decreased their
firing rate (224.8 ± 138.5 ms versus 426 ± 141.9 ms, t [12] =
2.58, p = 0.03, permuted t test; see Figure 2B).
In many human brain areas, neurons differentiate between vi-
sual categories [30]. We therefore next asked whether the
response of SN neurons differentiated between the three
different visual categories (animals, landscapes, and fruits) of
the images. We did not find evidence for SN category neurons:
a one-way permutation ANOVA did not reveal a significant num-
ber of neurons tuned to visual category (N = 6, 9.1%, p = 0.16;
Figure 2A). In contrast to the medial temporal lobe (MTL) [30],
we did not find a visual category signal in the SN.
SN Neurons Differentiate between Novel and Familiar
Stimuli
We next tested whether SN neurons signaled that a stimulus is
novel (shown the first time) or familiar (shown the second or third
time). Here, we refer to such neurons as memory-selective (MS)

 neurons [25]. We tested whether the response of SN neurons ex-
hibited this pattern by comparing the responses of neurons
following stimulus onset between novel and familiar trials. We
first focused on the subgroup that had a larger firing rate for novel
relative to familiar stimuli (see STAR Methods). We identified 11
such neurons (Figures 3A–3C; 16.6%, p = 0.002, compared to
null distribution; see also Figure S3A). We refer to this subset
of MS neurons as ‘‘novelty’’ neurons. This difference in response
between novel and familiar stimuli was already apparent when
the image was seen the second time (Figure 3D, middle). The
response remained but did not strengthen further when
comparing the second and third presentation of the same image
(t [10] = 1.36, p = 0.21, permuted paired t test; see Figure 3D,
right). Additionally, the difference in response between novel
and familiar stimuli did not depend on the delay between two
consecutive presentations of the same image (F [3,30] = 0.22,
p = 0.88, one-way permutation ANOVA; see Figure 3E).
We next tested whether other SN neurons increase their firing
rate in response to familiar images. We found that 6 neurons (9%,
p = 0.01, compared to null distribution; see also Figure S3B)
showed a significant increase for familiar compared to novel
images. Similar to novelty neurons, the response of such ‘‘famil-
iarity’’ neurons did not change further between the second
and third presentation of the same image (t [5] = 0.7, p = 0.06;

 Figure 3D) and was not modulated by the length of the delay be-
tween consecutive presentations of the same image (F [3,15] =
2.12, p = 0.14; Figure 3E). Together, these data demonstrated
that the firing rates of a substantial proportion of SN neurons
(16.6% and 9.0%; Figure 3A) were modulated by the novelty or
familiarity of images in a declarative memory task. Importantly,
this change in response was visible after a single learning trial
(Figure 3D) for both novelty and familiarity neurons.
We refer to the 17 novelty and familiarity neurons together as
MS neurons (Figure 3A). 4 MS neurons also qualified as image-
responsive neurons (i.e., they showed a change in firing rate
for all trials considered together; see Figure 2). The reason for
this small overlap is the absence of a response to the non-
preferred stimulus category. To show this, we compared the
firing rate of only the novel or familiar trials (depending on what
type of trial the neuron was sensitive to) with the baseline firing
rate. This revealed that MS cells had a significantly higher firing
rate during image presentation (0–1.5 s, 7.23 ± 17.9 Hz)
compared to baseline (�0.5–0 s, 6.2 ± 20.9 Hz, t [16] = 1.38,
p = 0.042, permuted paired t test), but only for their preferred
type of trial (novel or familiar; note that this is not by selection
because the baseline firing rate is not considered when selecting
MS neurons).
We performed additional control analyses to verify that this
memory signal was not due to other factors, such as electrode
drift or slow firing rate changes. First, we verified that no similar
difference existed during the baseline period: neither novelty-
nor familiarity-type MS neurons showed such a difference (Fig-
ure 3D, left; not significantly different versus 0 for novelty neu-
rons [t [10] = 0.07, p = 0.94] and familiarity neurons [t [5] =
0.58; p = 0.54]). We also tested how many MS neurons would
be selected if we used the baseline period (�0.5–0 s) rather
than the after-stimulus onset period for selection. This analysis
revealed only 1 (1.5%) out of 66 units with a significant difference
between novel and familiar images. Finally, we used a mixed-ef-
fect regression model to identify factors that explain variance in
the firing rate of MS neurons. As predictors, we used image fa-
miliarity and trial number (plus neuron cluster ID was used as a
random effect). This analysis revealed that the image familiarity
regressor was significant even after accounting for effects of trial
number and was much stronger than the trial number regressor
for both MS neuron types (novelty neurons: t [864] = 8.95,
p < 1e�30 for new/old regressor versus t [864] = 1.67; p = 0.09
for trial number regressor; familiarity neurons: t [501] = 7.24,
p < 1e�12 for new/old regressor versus t [501] = 3.67,
p = 0.0002 for trial number regressor). Lastly, note that we
randomly intermixed novel and familiar stimuli throughout the
experiment. Together, these control analyses verify that the dif-
ference in responses cannot be attributed to electrode drifts.
SN MS Neurons Predict Behavior
We next investigated whether the response of MS neurons
(tested separately for novelty- and familiarity-preferring neurons)
was related to memory by assessing whether their response
co-varied with the behavior of the subject. Specifically, we
compared the neural responses to familiar stimuli (those which
have been shown at least once before) that the patients correctly
remembered (response ‘‘old’’) to those they mistakenly forgot
(response ‘‘new’’). Behaviorally, patients showed good perfor-
mance: they remembered (true positive rate) 74% of images dur-
ing the first repetition (‘‘familiar 1’’) and 87% after the second
repetition (‘‘familiar 2’’). We found that the response of novelty
cells was significantly attenuated during trials in which familiar
images were mistakenly rated as novel compared to when they
were correctly rated as familiar, with a firing rate difference of
0.36 ± 0.36 Hz for incorrect and of 0.60 ± 0.24 Hz for correct trials
(see Figure 3F; t [11] = 2.72, p = 0.02, permuted paired t test; the
metric used was the difference in firing rate between when an
image was novel and familiar normalized by the baseline firing
rate). For this comparison, we excluded trials for which the initial
novel presentation was incorrect (a false positive), so the differ-
ence observed could only be attributed to forgotten images
(false negatives). However, although smaller, the response to
forgotten familiar stimuli was still significantly different from
zero (Figure 3F; t [11] = 3.98, p = 0.002, permuted t test).
Together, this analysis shows that the response of novelty neu-
rons was indicative of whether a familiar stimulus would be
remembered or forgotten. For neurons that increase their firing
rate (n = 6) to familiar images, this behavior-neuronal activity cor-
relation was quantitatively similar, but not significant (Figure 3F;
t [5] = 2.31, p = 0.056).
Latency of Response
How quickly after stimulus onset did the response of MS SN neu-
rons differentiate between novel and familiar images? To answer
this question, we next estimated the first point in time at which
responses differed between novel and familiar images. We
compared the cumulative sum of the spike trains, a method
that provides an estimate of the differential latency of a neuron
with high precision [31]. We found that the average differential
latency was 527 ms after image onset (Figure 3G). We compared
this latency with the latency of MS neurons (n = 122) recoded in
the MTL during a similar new/old recognition task in another pa-
tient population [32, 33]. MS neurons in the MTL had an average
differential latency of 311 ms, which was significantly faster
compared to the SN (p = 0.013, estimated based on an empiri-
cally estimated null distribution for which area labels were
randomly re-assigned). This result was also true when consid-
ering MS neurons that increased their firing rate to novelty and
familiar stimuli separately (p = 0.002 and p = 0.002, neurons,
respectively, compared to n = 64 novelty and n = 58 familiarity
neurons in MTL). This order of responses is compatible with
the Lisman and Grace model of the interaction between the hip-
pocampus and the VTA/SN [9].
Cell Type Analysis
The SN contains two principle types of neurons: inhibitory
GABAergic neurons and dopaminergic neurons that project to
remote targets, including the striatum, amygdala, and hippo-
campus [4, 34–36]. Using extracellular recordings, different cell
types can often be distinguished based on a combination of
the width of the extracellular spike waveform and mean firing
rate [37]. In particular, in the SN, it is known that dopaminergic
neurons have wider waveforms and lower firing rates compared
to GABAergic neurons [38, 39], which results in a bimodal distri-
bution of the waveform width across all neurons. We found that,
across all recorded neurons (N = 66), the distribution of spike
widths was bimodal (Hartigan’s dip statistic: 0.0717, p = 0.006

 [40]; see Figures 3H and 3I). We thus next investigated whether
MS neurons were preferentially of a certain cell type. We found
that MS neurons were on average characterized by longer wave-
forms compared to non-MS neurons (1.15 ± 0.23 ms versus
0.96 ± 0.32 ms; waveform length was measured as the time
that elapsed between the two positive peaks [14] of the wave-
form; t [65] = 2.65, p = 0.012, permutation t test; Figures 3H
and 3I). Additionally, MS neurons satisfied the criteria for DA neu-
rons established by previous work: 15/17 MS neurons had wave-
forms longer than 0.8 ms and firing rates lower than 15 Hz
[14, 41]. We also found that the recording sites where MS neu-
rons were identified were predominantly in the dorsal parts of
the SN (Figures 1D and 1E). These results are consistent with
the location of the pars compacta, in which the majority of dopa-
minergic neurons are located [42, 43]. Together, these analyses
support the view that the MS neurons we identified were puta-
tively dopaminergic.
SN-Cortex Interactions
Was the activity of SN neurons related to field potential activity
recorded from the basal ganglia and/or the cortical surface?
We quantified spike-field interactions using spike field coher-
ence (SFC) as a metric to answer this question. First, the SFC be-
tween SN neurons and the field potentials recorded in the basal
ganglia (STN) was significantly above chance in the theta-fre-
quency band (Figure 4A, left panel; significant at p < 0.05 in

 2–5 Hz across all N = 56 neurons with enough spikes). Note that
here the field potential was most likely recorded from the STN
and not the SN due to the location of the recording contact
3 mm above the microelectrode tip (see STAR Methods and Fig-
ure S2A). Second, SN neuron activity was also coordinated with
cortical field potentials: SN neurons had a preference to fire more
during certain phases of the theta and alpha frequency band of
ECoG signals recorded from the cortical surface (SFC was signif-
icantly different in the 6�12 Hz frequency band, N = 61, p < 0.05;
Figure 4A, right panel; see legend for statistics; see also Fig-
ure S4 for all electrodes). This was true only for one pair of
ECoG contacts located anterior to the central sulcus (labeled
as +2; other contacts were not significant; see Figure S4).
The +2 ECoG contacts were located on the superior frontal gyrus
in Brodmann area 6 (premotor cortex). This finding indicates that
SN neuronal activity is functionally connected to this region of
the frontal lobe (see Discussion). We next tested whether this
functional connection was behaviorally relevant by comparing
its strength between novel trials that were later remembered
with novel trials that were later forgotten.
Based on previous research and model predictions [26], we
hypothesized that the extent of spike-field coherence during en-
coding of novel images predicts whether subjects would suc-
cessfully encode a new memory or not. To test this hypothesis,
we compared the SFC during viewing of novel images between
trials that were later remembered correctly versus trials that were
later forgotten (i.e., identified as novel). This difference-due-to
memory comparison showed that images that were later remem-
bered were accompanied by higher SFC in the theta frequency
range for ECoGs measured anterior to the central sulcus during
encoding (N = 58 neurons, 3–9 Hz, p < 0.05; Figure 4B, right
panel; see legend for statistics). Note that this calculation only in-
cludes trials during which the image was seen for the first time
(novel) and which the subject correctly labeled as ‘‘new.’’ There-
fore, the response was always the same (‘‘new’’), excluding the
possibility that this difference was due to differences in motor
planning. Similar to the SFC considering all trials, this difference
was only significant for field potentials recorded from the
anterior
+2 contact
located
on
premotor
cortex
(central
sulcus +2; Figure 4B; Figures 4C and 4D show an example neu-
ron’s SFC and spike triggered average). We did not observe a
similar relationship with field potential recordings from the basal
ganglia (STN; Figure 4B, left panel; all p > 0.05). As a control, we
also compared ECoG power between the two conditions
but found no significant differences (Figure 4E; all p > 0.05).
Together, this shows that the extent of long-range SFC between
SN neuronal activity and frontal cortical field potential activity re-
corded from premotor cortex was predictive of successful mem-
ory formation.
How could this long-distance spike/field coordination be
achieved? To answer this question, we next performed a
phase-coherence analysis between the field potential record-
ings in basal ganglia (STN) and ECoG recordings from cortex
obtained while patients viewed the novel images (0–1.5 s relative
to stimulus onset; see STAR Methods). This analysis showed
that successful encoding of new memories was associated
with significantly higher phase coherence in the theta frequency
range (5–10 Hz; Figure 4F; p < 0.05; see legend for statistics).
Similar to the SFC finding, this effect was observable only on
the central sulcus +2 electrode (Figure 4G). The power of the
ECoG signals recorded from the central sulcus +2 electrode ex-
hibited a prominent beta-band power decrease starting about
500 ms after stimulus onset, which was most likely related to
movement preparation (Figure 4H). This beta decrease was pre-
ceded by an increase in theta frequency power (Figure 4H),
which started shortly following stimulus onset. This pattern
shows that processing an image increases the power of theta os-
cillations in frontal cortex, which provides a potential mechanism
by which SN neurons could modulate the extent of coordination
between their activity and frontal cortical theta. Here, we show
that the extent of such phase locking is predictive of memory en-
coding success, which suggests that theta frequency range os-
cillations coordinate information transfer between areas during
memory encoding.
DISCUSSION
We found that the activity of individual neurons in the human sub-
stantia nigra differentiates between novel and familiar images in
a hippocampal-dependent declarative memory task. Addition-
ally, we found that the degree of coordination of the activity of
SN neurons with frontal theta frequency oscillations was predic-
tive of successful memory formation. Although previous work
shows that human SN neurons respond to reward prediction
errors [14] and infrequent sounds in an odd-ball paradigm [16],
our data are, to our knowledge, the first study describing
SN neuronal activity during declarative memory formation in
humans.
The electrophysiological properties of the memory selective
cells we describe indicate that these cells are most likely dopa-
minergic. This conclusion rests on two pieces of data: the width
of their waveforms and anatomical location. Dopaminergic neu-
rons have considerably wider extracellular waveforms compared
to the GABAergic neurons also located in SN [38, 39, 44]. Also,
although dopaminergic neurons exist throughout the SN, the
majority are located in the pars compacta subregion of the SN
[42, 43]. Most dopaminergic neurons should therefore be located
in the dorsal-medial part of the SN, which is the area where we
found the majority of MS neurons. Together, these criteria have
been demonstrated to reliably separate dopaminergic and
GABAergic neurons in the SN based on electrophysiological
features alone [38, 39, 44–46]. A definitive confirmation of this
assertion will require either histological analysis [47] or genetic
targeting [38]. Here, we refer to these neurons as putatively
dopaminergic to indicate that this conclusion rests on extracel-
lular recordings alone.
A second consideration is the effect of ongoing neurodegener-
ation on our results. The majority of the subjects in the study had
PD and therefore suffered from a substantial loss of dopami-
nergic cells in the SN. However, our recordings accessed an
anatomical area where a sufficient population of dopaminergic
neurons is still functional even in PD. Dopaminergic loss in
PD progresses unevenly [48, 49], targeting some areas more
severely than others. Post mortem tissue analyses in PD patients
typically show high loss of dopaminergic neurons in the caudal
part of the SN, with approximately 90% of cells lost. In contrast,
cell loss in more dorsal areas is more moderate (50% or less) to a
degree comparable with what can be observed in normal aging
Current Biology 28, 1333–1343, May 7, 2018

 [49]. Indeed, several studies have succeeded in recording from
putative dopaminergic neurons in patients with PD undergoing
STN DBS surgery [14, 41]. With the surgical target in the STN,
it is reasonable to expect SN recordings to be located predom-
inantly in the dorsal area of the SN. This assumption was
confirmed by the analysis of our electrode positions, which
showed most recordings located in the dorsal part of the SN,
where disease impact is expected to be relatively minor [49]. It
remains unknown, however, whether PD could have influenced
the waveforms of the remaining DA neurons that we recorded.
Although we did not detect a correlation of disease severity
with waveform duration (see STAR Methods), this issue remains
an open question. Finally, the patients enrolled in our study were
at considerably earlier PD stages than those included in post
mortem analysis [48, 49], therefore preserving a higher density
of dopaminergic cells in the dorsal areas of the SN.
It has been proposed that the role of dopaminergic mod-
ulation of hippocampal memory processes is to enhance syn-
aptic plasticity for important events, such as those that are
rewarding, aligned with a subject’s goals, or that attract atten-
tion [9, 23]. The proposed pathway for this signal to reach the
SN/VTA is through afferents from the nucleus accumbens
(NA) and pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPTg), which
are both structures involved in mediating motivational and
attentional processes [50, 51]. Both NA and PPTg in turn
receive inputs from the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the hippo-
campus, enabling them to integrate signals about current goals
and stimulus novelty [23, 50, 51]. It has been hypothesized
that hippocampal novelty signals cause dopamine release
within the hippocampus through this multisynaptic pathway
[9, 23]. Here, we identified putative dopaminergic neurons
within the SN that are compatible with this hypothesis because
they respond with an increase in firing rate to novel stimuli.
Interestingly, in addition to novelty neurons, we also identified
a smaller group of putative dopaminergic neurons that re-
sponded with an increase in firing rate to familiar stimuli. The
response characteristics of this group of neurons were other-
wise similar to novelty neurons (Figures 3D, 3E, and 3H), with
the exception that they were not significantly indicative of
whether a familiar stimulus would be remembered or forgotten
(but note that this is most likely due a lack of statistical power).
Although those neurons are not directly predicted by the theo-
retical model of Lisman and Grace, it is likely that they also play
a role in learning. For example, different concentrations of
DA can lead to either synaptic depression or potentiation [52]
and levels of DA can control the long-term potentiation
(LTP)/long-term depression (LTD) threshold [53]. This suggests
that neurons that increase levels of DA for familiar stimuli
might participate in maintaining this homeostasis. Additionally,
different types of dopamine receptors have different sensitiv-
ities and activation thresholds and mediate different aspects
of plasticity, including encoding versus consolidation of mem-
ories [54, 55]. Together, this literature combined with our
finding supports the hypothesis that familiarity neurons have
a role in the plasticity mechanisms that serve to strengthen
already encoded memories. Future work is needed to directly
test this hypothesis.
The latency of the SN responses was also compatible with
the Lisman and Grace model, namely that SN MS responses
emerged significantly later compared to those observed in the
MTL [33]. Here, we found that SN responses were first visible
527 ms after stimulus onset, a time which was larger than
the 311 ms interval observed in the MTL [32]. A caveat of this
comparison is that it was derived from two different patient pop-
ulations (PD and epilepsy, respectively). Together, our results
support the idea that the information about stimulus novelty
observed in the SN originates in the MTL. Importantly, the extent
of the modulation of SN cells was indicative of whether a subject
would correctly recognize a familiar stimulus. This result indi-
cates that the response of SN cells was behaviorally relevant
for the declarative memory task that our subjects performed.
This finding is also in line with human studies showing that SN
fMRI-blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) activity predicts
successful memory formation [5, 6]. However, it remains un-
known what the relationship is between the activity of different
cell types in the SN and the BOLD signal (but see [56]). In
contrast, here we identified specific SN cell types electrophysio-
logically and showed that it is the phasic activity of putative DA
neurons shortly after stimulus onset that is predictive of memory
formation.
We observed that the activity of SN neurons was systemati-
cally related to the phase of ongoing theta oscillations in the
frontal cortex (measured over the premotor cortex). This coordi-
nation was behaviorally relevant because the extent of phase
locking was predictive of memory formation success. Oscilla-
tions in the theta frequency range are thought to coordinate
information flow between the MTL, basal ganglia, and frontal
cortex [27–29]. Here, we now show that, in humans, SN neuronal
firing is related to cortical theta frequency oscillations and that
such coordination is behaviorally relevant for memory formation.
The importance of theta synchrony between the basal ganglia
and frontal cortex has been established by previous recordings
of human patients performing cognitive tasks [57, 58]. Interest-
ingly, slow 4 Hz stimulation of the STN improves performance
in cognitive tasks [58]. A key unknown question is whether the
theta oscillations we quantified are related to or synchronized
with hippocampal theta [27–29].
Antidromic stimulation of the STN evokes short latency re-
sponses in premotor cortex, which is compatible with a ‘‘hyper-
direct’’ pathway in humans [59]. There are thus at least three
pathways by which information from the MTL could reach the
SN: (1) via the NA and PPTg; (2) via the hyperdirect route;
and (3) through the striatum, which is interconnected with
most of the frontal cortex [60]. This rich innervation most likely
gives rise to the functional dependency of SN and frontal cortex
as observed using BOLD-fMRI [61, 62]. Also, BOLD activity in
frontal cortex predicts successful encoding of new memories
[63], a signal which is thought to be a reflection of the role of
frontal cortex (including premotor areas) in facilitating the en-
coding of goal-relevant information and in organizing multiple
pieces of information into an individual memory [63]. Here, we
now show a possible mechanism by which such information
could influence the strength of memory encoding by modu-
lating dopaminergic SN activity. A key future experiment
will be to determine whether SN neuronal activity is also coor-
dinated with hippocampal theta oscillations and how these
theta oscillations relate to the frontal cortical theta oscillations
measured here.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
23 patients with Parkinson’s Disease (PD) and two with Essential Tremor undergoing implantation of a DBS electrode in the subtha-
lamic nucleus (STN) volunteered for the study and gave written informed consent (see Table S1). Surgical indications for DBS fol-
lowed established guidelines [64]. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. All
patients undergoing surgery underwent pre-operative neuropsychological testing that confirmed the absence of severe cognitive
abnormalities that would have precluded DBS (see Table S1 for neuropsychological scores). For patients requiring bilateral implan-
tation a second surgery was performed 1-2 weeks after the first surgery. To test whether the severity of PD of a patient could have
affected our recordings we correlated electrophysiological measures (waveform properties, mean firing rate, proportion of novelty
neurons identified) with the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) score (measured when DBS was Off). However,
we did not find any significant correlations. Here we report some of the correlations: UPDRS versus mean waveform
length r = �0.25 p = 0.34; UPDRS versus mean firing rate r = �0.21 p = 0.43; UPDRS versus number of novelty neurons
r = �0.45 p = 0.11. This shows that in this surgical patient sample, PD severity did not correlate with features of our electrophysio-
logical recordings.
METHOD DETAILS
Task
Subjects performed a continuous recognition memory task, during which they classified a series of images as novel or familiar (Fig-
ure 1B). Images were shown on an LCD screen positioned 60 cm in front of the subject’s face, resulting in an image size of 18 degrees
of visual angle. Each trial started with fixation cross shown for 0.5-1.0 s (randomized). Afterward, an image was shown for 1.5 s. Each
image belonged to one of three visual categories (animals, landscapes, fruits; one third each). After image offset, a fixation cross was
shown for 0.5 s, followed by the question screen (Figure 1B). This screen stayed on the screen until patients made a response
(no timeout). Participants responded by pressing either the green or red button on a response pad (RB-844, Cedrus Inc) using the
hand contralateral to the side of recording. Which color corresponded to ‘new’ and which to ‘old’ was shown at the top of the question
screen. We used this approach to switch the location of the ‘new’ and ‘old’ buttons in the middle of the experiment as a control. This
switch did not significantly impact behavioral performance (accuracy just before switch was 86% ± 34%, compared to 82% ± 28%
after the switch (t [24] = 0.37; p = 0.97). Trials with new and old images were intermixed. Each session of the experiment consisted
of 108 trials, during which 54 unique images were shown up to three times. The task was implemented in MATLAB using the Psy-
chophysics Toolbox [65].

 Target planning
DBS electrodes were inserted using a well-established technique [66]. Briefly, prior to surgery patients underwent a 3T T1 weighted
and T2 weighted high resolution (2mm slice thickness) MRI of the brain. The MRI provided high resolution visualization of the STN and
other deep brain nuclei to aid in surgical planning. On the morning of surgery, patients had a stereotactic frame (CRW, Integra)
secured to their head, followed by a CT scan (1.25 mm contiguous slices from vertex to foramen magnum, 0-degree gantry angle)
with a fiducial localizer attached to the frame during scanning. The CT scan and the previously acquired MRI scan were then co-regis-
tered (Framelink, Stealth Station Medtronic, Inc; see Figure S2E). Next, we defined the location of the anterior and posterior commis-
sures, with the resultant mid-point of the AC-PC (commissural) line defining the center (X = 0, Y = 0, Z = 0) of the coordinate system
used. The STN target was then selected using standard atlas based methods (x = +/�12.0, y = �4.0, z = �4.0) and refined based on
patient specific anatomy. An entry point was selected, typically anterior to the coronal suture and approximately 3 cm lateral to
midline, roughly 60 degrees anterior and 15 degrees lateral to the vertex of the frame. The entry and target points (and associated
trajectory) were then further adjusted based on each patient’s anatomy. The goal of planning was to define a trajectory that minimized
traversing of brain sulci, avoided the lateral ventricle of the brain, and traversed along the long axis of the STN. The SN is typically
situated 2-3 mm below the STN, but can vary from being directly adjacent to up to 4-5 mm deep.
Surgery
In the operating room, the patient was sedated and long-lasting lidocaine was used to anesthetize the skin. The planned entry site
was shaved, prepared, and draped in sterile fashion. The target coordinates were manually set on the CRW arc and placed onto the
frame. The microdrive (Alpha Omega, Nazareth, Il.) was positioned on the frame and once the skin was opened, the exact angle and
location of the entry point was marked on the skull using a guide cannula. A drill was then used to create a 10mm bur hole directly over
this site. Once the hole was drilled a plastic outer ring was placed around the hole for later locking of the electrode. The dura was then
opened widely and the cortex exposed. An 8-contact strip (Ad-Tech, IS08RSP10X-0T1) electrode was then passed into the subdural
space in a posterior and slightly lateral trajectory until all electrodes made contact with the brain surface. The strip electrode invariably
extended posterior to the central sulcus, with electrodes covering the pre- and post-central sulci as well as the pre-motor cortex (see
Figures 1F, S2C, and S2D). The microdrive was then aligned directly over the bur hole and one or two guide cannulas (15mm length,
Alpha Omega STR-000021) were inserted into the brain, one aimed directly along the planned target, and a second one 2mm either
lateral, medial, anterior, or posterior to the target trajectory as indicated by the likely best secondary trajectory to the STN. Once both
guide cannulas were placed the burr hole was covered with a dural sealant (DuraSeal, Integra) to prevent egress of CSF and minimize
brain shift. Microelectrodes were then inserted and recordings were started 25mm above the planned target.
Electrophysiology
We used a microelectrode (Alpha Omega, STR-000080-0024950; see Figure S2A) that contains both a tungsten microeletrode
(�0.5 MU impedance) and a lower impedance (3.2 kU) macro contact for field potential recordings that is located 3 mm above
the microelectrode tip. For signal acquisition, we used either an Alpha Omega MicroGuide or Neuroomega system. ECoG and field
potentials signals were recorded using a 1-1000 Hz bandpass filter. Microelectrode recordings were performed using a 250 – 6000 Hz
bandpass filter. As reference for the ECoG recordings we used one of the contacts located on the cortical strip. As reference for the
microelectrode we used the electrode cannula. Because of technical problems we did not record the basal ganglia field potentials
signal in two sessions. Also, a further session did not have usable ECoG recordings.
Localization of electrodes
Once the electrodes were placed the patient was awakened from sedation. Recordings were not started until the patient was alert
and responsive. Continuous ECoG was recorded while the microelectrodes were advanced toward the STN, typically in increments
of 1 mm until the STN was encountered and 0.3-0.5mm steps once the STN was encountered. The STN was identified based on the
characteristic neuronal discharge pattern of large, irregular, high amplitude and high frequency discharges with a thickened baseline
[67]. The STN was typically recorded for a length of 2.5-5 mm, after which a quiet zone was encountered, with re-emergence of high
amplitude, high frequency neurons at 0-3 mm below the STN, identifying the SN [67]. Microelectrode recording locations were iden-
tified and documented based on the pre-operative planning (Figure S2E). In addition, in a subset of cases where localization was
uncertain, we used electrical microstimulation (10 mA, 500 ms duration, 200 Hz frequency) to further confirm positioning (Figure S2F).
This stimulation procedure allowed us to reliably differentiate STN from SN because weak electrical stimulation transiently inhibits
activity of SN but not STN neurons (see Figure S2F for an example) for several hundred ms after the offset of stimulation [67]. Talairach
coordinates of the final recording position were determined using the StealthStation software by appropriately adjusting the original
plan with modifications made during surgery. Talairach coordinates for one session were unrecoverable for technical reasons.
The ECoG strip was localized based on two methods: first, we used median nerve stimulation of the contralateral hand (20 – 30 mA,
Cadwell Elite system; see Figure S2B for an example) in order to locate the central sulcus based on the location of the evoked po-
tential polarity reversal [68]. Second, in a subset of cases (6 sessions), we acquired intra-operative X-ray images (lateral and AP) while
the ECoG strip was in place. We then utilized the LOC software package [22] to merge this image with the FreeSurfer reconstructed
cortical surface [69] (see Figures S2C and S2D for an example) as determined from the pre-operative MRI scans [70]. Comparing the
results of this procedure with the result of median nerve stimulation revealed that median nerve stimulation alone was highly accurate.
For this reason, we subsequently relied exclusively on median nerve stimulation to localize the ECoG strip. For analysis purposes, we
Current Biology 28, 1333–1343.e1–e4, May 7, 2018
e2
 assigned to each pair of channels a number of �1, 0, +1, +2 or +3, which indicates the location of an ECoG contact relative to the
central sulcus (see Figure 1F). All ECoG analysis was based on bipolar re-referenced channels to remove common effects of activity
present on the reference (see Figure 1F for pairs used). Thus, the numbers �1 through +3 indicate pairs of channels that were sub-
tracted from each other before analysis.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Spike sorting and quality metrics of single units
The raw signal was filtered with a zero-phase lag filter in the 300 to 3,000Hz band, and spikes were detected and sorted using a semi-
automated template-matching algorithm [71]. We computed the following spike sorting quality metrics for all identified putative single
units to assess their quality (Figure S1): (i) the percentage of interspike intervals (ISIs) below 3 ms was 0.22% ± 0.43%; (ii) the ratio
between the s.d. of the noise and the peak amplitude of the mean waveform of each cluster was 2.92 ± 1.07 (peak SNR); (iii) the pair-
wise projection distance in clustering space between all neurons isolated on the same wire was 12.31 ± 6.67 (projection test; in units
of s.d. of the signal) [72]; (iv) the modified coefficient of variation of variability in the ISI (CV2) was 0.9 ± 0.08; and (v) the mean isolation
distance [73] was 102.2. We calculated the isolation distance in a ten-dimensional feature space (energy, peak amplitude, total area
under the waveform and the first five principal components of the energy-normalizes waveforms [73]).
Statistics
Unless otherwise noted, all statistical comparisons were conducted using non-parametric permutation tests. The null distribution for
each statistic was estimated by scrambling the order of trial labels randomly (repeated 2000 times). This procedure was used as im-
plemented in the EEGLAB toolbox [74]. For comparisons between two groups, we used t-statistics (referred to as permuted t test).
For comparisons with more than two conditions, we used F-statistics. In either case, the t and F statistics were estimated using the
empirically estimated null distribution instead of their parametric versions. As a consequence, note that the reported p values may
differ from those expected from the t- and F-distribution.
Single neuron analysis
The mean activity of each cell was computed in bins of 400 ms width that were advanced in steps of 1ms. To determine whether the
activity of a cell differentiated between two conditions (three for visual categories), we statistically compared the mean activity in each
group in every such bin located within the time period of 0-1.5 s relative to stimulus onset (see above for description of the permuted
t-and F statistics used).
We used a cluster-based approach to correct for multiple comparisons [75]. For this purpose, a cluster is defined as a group of
adjacent tests that are all significant at p < 0.05. For all such identified clusters, we tested whether the summed value of the test sta-
tistic across all values that are part of the cluster was larger than the 95th percentile of the same value estimated from the null dis-
tribution (based on scrambled labels). Clusters that did not exceed this value were removed from the list of significant time points.
When at least one cluster passed this correction for multiple comparisons, that neuron was considered as significant. To determine
whether the number of selected neurons for a given comparison was larger than that expected by chance we compared the number
of actually selected neurons to that selected when repeating the same procedure after randomly scrambling the trial labels (repeated
500 times). This provided a null distribution for assessing the probability of observing a given number of neurons by chance. To test if
the firing rate of a neuron changed in response to the onset of a stimulus we compared mean firing rates between the period of time
before image onset (�0.5-0 s relative to image onset) with each bin of the PSTH after image onset (0-1.5 s, corrected for multiple
comparisons as described above). To determine whether the number of selected neurons for this selection was larger than that
observed by chance we compared the number of actually selected neurons to that selected when repeating the same procedure
on data with scrambled labels (baseline versus after image onset period, repeated 500 times).
To select MS neurons, we used the following procedure. We first compared whether the firing rate, after stimulus onset (0-1.5 s),
differed between novel and familiar stimuli (as described above using a two-tailed permutated t test with cluster correction [75]). For
every neuron that satisfied this criterion, we then labeled the neuron as a novelty- or familiarity-type according to which trial type had
a higher firing rate relative to the other condition (novel > familiar and familiar > novel, respectively).
To summarize the response of MS neurons, we used as a metric the ratio between the mean response to novel minus the mean
response to familiar stimuli (counting only spikes that occurred during the period of time during which the comparison used to select
the neuron was significant), divided by the baseline firing rate of the neuron over the entire task (Figures 3D–3F). We multiplied this
metric by �1 for neurons that responded more strongly to familiar than to novel images.
Differential latency analysis
To compute the point in time at which a neuron’s response first differentiated between two conditions we used a differential latency
approach. We first binned the spike trains of each trial into 1-ms bins and computed the cumulative sum [31]. Second, we averaged
the cumulative sums of all trials of a neuron that belong to the same condition. We then compared the difference between the two
cumulative sums with zero using a permutation t test to find the points of time at which they were significantly different. The latency is
defined as the first significant bin which passes the cluster correction for multiple comparisons [75].

 Field potential analysis
The SFC is the ratio of the spectrum of the spike triggered average (STA) normalized by the averaged spectra of the traces used for
constructing the STA [26, 76]. The STA was computed by averaging short segments of 1 s length (±500 ms centered on each spike) of
the field potential. Field potentials were high-pass filtered at 1Hz before the spike-triggered snippets were extracted. All spikes from
0-2.5 s following stimulus onset were used. The spectrum was calculated using multitaper analysis using 5 tapers and a time-band-
width product of 3 (Chronux toolbox [77]). For Figure 4A, the null distribution was estimated by adding a random time (at least 1s, at
most the remaining length of the experiment -1s, uniformly distributed; spike times were wrapped around to assure that none were
located outside of the experiment) to the entire spike train and repeating this procedure 500 times. Using this null distribution, we then
tested whether the observed SFC value at a given frequency was larger than expected by chance using a permutation t test. For each
SFC comparison we used a cluster-based approach to correct for multiple comparisons [75]. To compare the SFC between two
experimental conditions, we equalized the number of spikes used for each condition by taking a random subset of spikes from
the condition with more spikes. The reason for this is that the SFC is biased by the number of spikes used [78]. For visualization
only, we in addition z-scored the SFC with respect to the mean and standard deviation across all conditions and frequencies of a
cell before averaging across cells. When comparing forgotten and remembered familiar trials, only the first repetition (‘‘familiar 1’’)
was used. The computation of SFC for basal ganglia and cortex include different numbers of cells (56 versus 61, respectively)
because we did not record basal ganglia field potentials signal in two sessions due to technical problems. Also, a further session
did not have usable ECoG recordings due to problems inserting the electrode strip. For the remember-forgotten comparison we
in addition also discarded two additional units because these units fired no spikes during the presentation of the forgotten stimuli
(making it impossible to estimate their SFC).
For time-frequency decompositions and phase-coherence analysis we used wavelets as implemented in the EEGLAB toolbox [74].
We used morlet wavelets composed of 3 cycles for time- frequency analysis and 1 cycle for phase-coherence analysis. For
comparing the phase-coherence and power between remembered and forgotten images we also equalized the number of trials.
To exclude artifacts, trials during which the absolute value of the ECoG or field potentials exceeded 3x the s.d. were excluded.
