BACKGROUND
Glioblastoma is associated with a poor prognosis in the elderly. Survival has been 
shown to increase among patients 70 years of age or younger when temozolomide 
chemotherapy is added to standard radiotherapy (60 Gy over a period of 6 weeks). In 
elderly patients, more convenient shorter courses of radiotherapy are commonly used, 
but the benefit of adding temozolomide to a shorter course of radiotherapy is unknown.
METHODS
We conducted a trial involving patients 65 years of age or older with newly diagnosed 
glioblastoma. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either radiotherapy alone 
(40 Gy in 15 fractions) or radiotherapy with concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide.
RESULTS
A total of 562 patients underwent randomization, 281 to each group. The median age 
was 73 years (range, 65 to 90). The median overall survival was longer with radio-
therapy plus temozolomide than with radiotherapy alone (9.3 months vs. 7.6 months; 
hazard ratio for death, 0.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.56 to 0.80; P<0.001), as 
was the median progression-free survival (5.3 months vs. 3.9 months; hazard ratio 
for disease progression or death, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.60; P<0.001). Among 165 
patients with methylated O6-methylguanine–DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) status, 
the median overall survival was 13.5 months with radiotherapy plus temozolomide 
and 7.7 months with radiotherapy alone (hazard ratio for death, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.38 
to 0.73; P<0.001). Among 189 patients with unmethylated MGMT status, the median 
overall survival was 10.0 months with radiotherapy plus temozolomide and 7.9 
months with radiotherapy alone (hazard ratio for death, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.56 to 1.01; 
P 
= 
0.055; P 
= 
0.08 for interaction). Quality of life was similar in the two trial groups.
CONCLUSIONS
In elderly patients with glioblastoma, the addition of temozolomide to short-course 
radiotherapy resulted in longer survival than short-course radiotherapy alone. (Funded

G
lioblastoma is a fatal illness that 
is associated with a median survival of 
less than 2 years. Population studies of 
glioblastoma have shown that survival declines 
with increasing age,1,2 and the incidence of glio-
blastoma is increasing, especially among the el-
derly.3 Older patients have been underrepresented 
in most randomized trials, in which the average 
age of participants is approximately 55 years, as 
compared with the population-based median for 
patients with glioblastoma of 65 years of age.2 In 
2005, a phase 3 trial of radiotherapy alone (60 Gy 
over a period of 6 weeks) versus radiotherapy plus 
temozolomide showed longer survival with the 
combination.4 However, that trial included only 
patients 70 years of age or younger. Exploratory 
analyses have suggested less effect from the addi-
tion of temozolomide with increasing age, with 
less survival benefit among patients 65 to 70 years 
of age (hazard ratio for death, 0.78; 95% confi-
dence interval [CI], 0.50 to 1.24; P 
= 
0.29) than 
among younger patients.2
Management of glioblastoma in patients 65 
years of age or older is difficult given the poor 
prognosis, frequent coexisting conditions, and an 
increased risk of toxic effects from radiotherapy 
on the aging brain5; however, phase 3 studies 
have shown the effectiveness of shorter courses 
of radiotherapy as compared with supportive care 
alone6 or standard radiotherapy (60 Gy over a 
period of 6 weeks).7 There is also evidence that 
temozolomide alone may be more effective than 
radiotherapy alone for elderly patients with methy-
lation of the O6-methylguanine–DNA methyltrans-
ferase (MGMT) gene promoter region.8 Although 
the incidence of MGMT promoter methylation is 
not age-dependent, data are lacking with respect 
to the benefit of adding temozolomide to short-
course radiotherapy in elderly patients with glio-
blastoma and its dependence on status regarding 
MGMT promoter methylation in tumors (MGMT 
status).5,9,10 We tested whether a new chemoradia-
tion strategy for elderly patients with glioblasto-
ma would confer a survival advantage over short-
course radiotherapy alone, especially among 
patients with methylated MGMT status.
Methods
Trial Oversight
Each participating center obtained approval from 
the local ethics board, and each patient provided 
written informed consent. All data were collected 
and maintained by the Canadian Cancer Trials 
Group (CCTG) in Kingston, Ontario. The trial 
was sponsored in Canada by the CCTG, in Europe 
by the European Organisation for Research and 
Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), and in Australia 
and New Zealand by the Trans Tasman Radiation 
Oncology Group. Trial medication was supplied 
by Schering-Plough (now Merck), which had no 
role in the design of the trial, the collection or 
analysis of data, or the preparation of the manu-
script. The trial was designed by the cochairs of 
the cooperative groups, and the first draft of the 
manuscript was prepared by the first author with-
out writing assistance. All the authors partici-
pated in the preparation of the manuscript and 
the decision to submit it for publication, and all 
vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the 
data and for adherence of the trial to the proto-
col, which is available with the full text of this 
article at NEJM.org.
Key Eligibility Criteria
This randomized, phase 3 trial enrolled patients 
65 years of age or older who had newly diagnosed 
glioblastoma (World Health Organization grade IV 
astrocytoma), which was histologically confirmed 
after surgery or biopsy performed less than 28 
days before randomization. Patients were deemed 
by their physicians not to be suitable to receive 
conventional radiotherapy (60 Gy in 30 fractions 
over a period of 6 weeks) in combination with 
temozolomide. Eligible patients had an Eastern 
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance 
status of 0, 1, or 2 (on a scale ranging from 0 to 4, 
with higher values indicating greater disability) 
and were receiving glucocorticoids at a stable or 
decreasing dose. Adequate hematologic, renal, 
and hepatic function, as specified in the proto-
col, was required. Protocol treatment began with-
in 2 weeks after randomization.
Treatment
Patients were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, 
to receive either radiotherapy alone or radiother-
apy plus temozolomide. Radiation was planned 
with the use of three-dimensional planning sys-
tems for a total dose of 40.05 Gy, administered 
in 15 daily fractions over a period of 3 weeks. 
Concurrent temozolomide was administered with 
radiotherapy at a dose of 75 mg per square meter 
of body-surface area per day for 21 consecutive 
days from day 1 until the final day of radio-
therapy. Adjuvant temozolomide was administered

Short-Course Radiation plus Temozolomide in Glioblastoma
at a dose of 150 to 200 mg per square meter per 
day for 5 consecutive days of a 28-day cycle for 
up to 12 cycles or until disease progression. Use 
of antiemetic and infection prophylaxis was at the 
discretion of the investigator.
Radiotherapy Quality Assurance
The procedure for radiotherapy quality assurance 
involved a single dry-run case from each center 
that was reviewed by the chair of radiotherapy 
quality assurance. If a dry run was deemed un-
satisfactory, enrollment at that center was sus-
pended until acceptable changes were made. The 
gross tumor volume was defined as the contrast-
enhancing volume on the postsurgical planning 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan and in-
cluded the surgical bed. The clinical target vol-
ume was a 1.5-cm margin respecting anatomical 
boundaries beyond the gross-tumor-volume con-
tour, and a planning target volume margin of 
0.5 cm was applied. Planning specifications are 
provided in the trial protocol.
Patient Evaluation and Follow-up
Local pathological diagnosis was accepted, with 
a requirement for provision of tissue for central 
histologic review and assessment of MGMT sta-
tus. Baseline tests included neurologic examina-
tion, Mini–Mental State Examination (MMSE; 
scores range from 0 to 30, with higher scores 
indicating better cognitive function), and MRI. 
Follow-up requirements were identical for both 
groups. Quality-of-life instruments were adminis-
tered weekly on day 1 of weeks 1, 2, and 3 during 
radiotherapy, then 1 week after the last day of 
radiotherapy, and then every 3 months until dis-
ease progression. The instruments were the EORTC 
Quality of Life Questionnaire–Core 30 (QLQ-C30) 
and the EORTC brain module (QLQ-BN20). The 
QLQ-C30 has five function domains (physical, role 
[work and household activities], emotional, cog-
nitive, and social) and three symptom domains 
(fatigue, nausea and vomiting, and pain). It also 
includes five single-symptom domains (dyspnea, 
sleep, appetite, constipation, and diarrhea) and a 
global assessment domain. The QLQ-BN20 has 
four brain-cancer symptom clusters (visual, motor, 
communication, and uncertainty about the future) 
in addition to seven disease and treatment assess-
ments (headache, seizures, drowsiness, hair loss, 
itching skin, leg weakness, and trouble control-
ling bladder function). For each function do-
main and symptom item, a linear transforma-
tion was applied to standardize the raw score to 
a range of 0 to 100. Full details of the analytic 
methods are in the Supplementary Appendix, 
available at NEJM.org.
Pathological Review and MGMT 
Determination
Central pathological review was mandatory. For-
malin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections of tis-
sue blocks or tumor microarrays were subject to 
immunohistochemical staining for isocitrate de-
hydrogenase mutation with anti–IDH1 R132H 
antibody, as described in the Supplementary 
Appendix. Methylation status of the MGMT gene 
promoter region was tested as described previ-
ously11; testing was performed retrospectively, 
with the evaluators unaware of the treatment 
assignments and outcome data. (For details of 
the analysis, see the Supplementary Appendix.)
Determination of Disease Progression
Progressive disease was defined as objective (ra-
diologic) progression. For patients with complete 
resections at trial entry, progressive disease was 
defined as recurrent contrast-enhancing tumor 
detected on subsequent brain imaging. For pa-
tients with measurable disease at trial entry, 
progressive disease was defined as a new lesion 
or an increase by 25% or more in the estimated 
tumor area (two perpendicular diameters). Be-
cause early contrast enhancement can occur in 
at least the first 3 months after radiotherapy, the 
protocol anticipated cases of pseudoprogression. 
If brain imaging could not be performed, symp-
tomatic progression was used to define progres-
sion. Symptomatic progressive disease was de-
fined as a deterioration in health in the absence 
of both radiologic progression and clinical ex-
planations other than true progressive disease 
(e.g., seizures, stroke, or toxic effects of anticon-
vulsant agents). The determination of deteriora-
tion in health was at the discretion of the local 
principal investigator, but radiologic confirmation 
was strongly recommended and symptomatic 
progressive disease was used only when imaging 
could not be performed. The date of progressive 
disease was defined as the first time that the 
criteria were met.
Statistical Analysis
The primary end point was overall survival, mea-
sured from the date of randomization until death 
or censoring at the last day that the patient was

known to be alive. Progression-free survival was 
measured from the date of randomization until 
disease progression or death (if no progression 
was reported) or until the last evaluation date. We 
used the log-rank test adjusted for the stratifica-
tion factors at randomization to test for differ-
ences in overall and progression-free survival.
We calculated that at least 520 events (deaths) 
would be required for the trial to have 90% 
power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.75 (median 
overall survival of 8 months with radiotherapy plus 
temozolomide vs. 6 months with radiotherapy 
alone), at a two-sided 5% level. Treatment assign-
ment was performed centrally with the random-
ization algorithm dynamically minimizing the 
chance of an imbalance between trial groups 
with respect to the following stratification factors: 
center, ECOG performance status (0 or 1 vs. 2), 
age group (65 to 70 years vs. 71 to 75 years vs. 
≥76 years), and extent of resection (biopsy only 
vs. partial or complete resection). A single interim 
analysis of overall survival to assess futility was 
planned when 120 events (deaths) had occurred; 
the two-stage stopping rule of Ellenberg and 
Eisenberger was used.12 Final analysis populations 
included the intention-to-treat population (all 
randomly assigned patients) for all efficacy end 
points and the as-treated population (all patients 
who received at least one dose of trial treatment) 
for safety and drug-exposure analyses.
Results
Patient Characteristics
Patients underwent randomization from Novem-
ber 2007 through September 2013. The prespeci-
fied interim analysis occurred in April 2011, and 
the independent data and safety monitoring com-
mittee recommended continuation. After the 
number of prespecified events was reached, the 
last evaluation date for data was March 3, 2015, 
and the final database was locked for analysis 
on March 1, 2016. All 562 randomly assigned 
patients (281 in each group) were included in the 
intention-to-treat analysis, including 3 patients 
who did not receive the assigned intervention 
(2 assigned to radiotherapy plus temozolomide 
and 1 assigned to radiotherapy alone) (Fig. 1). 
Almost all the patients were followed until they 
died: 263 (93.6%) assigned to radiotherapy plus 
temozolomide and 272 (96.8%) assigned to ra-
diotherapy alone. For the small group of patients

central laboratory. Twelve of the 515 tissue sam-
ples were nondiagnostic owing to a paucity of non-
necrotic tissue. Among the 503 samples examined 
centrally, glioblastoma was confirmed in 480 
(95.4%), high-grade glioma in 15 (3.0%), diffuse 
glioma lacking high-grade features in 5 (1.0%), 
and anaplastic oligodendroglioma in 3 (0.6%). 
Immunohistochemical staining for the IDH-1 
R132H mutation was positive in only 4 of the 
481 specimens that were suitable for analysis.
Treatment Adherence
Treatment adherence was high and, with respect 
to radiotherapy, did not differ significantly be-
tween trial groups. The median duration of radio-
therapy was 3 weeks (15 fractions) and the me-
dian dose delivery was 40.05 Gy in both groups. 
The median duration of concomitant temozolo-
mide was 21 days, as planned. The median num-
ber of adjuvant cycles delivered was five. A total 
of 11 of the 281 patients assigned to radiotherapy 
plus temozolomide did not receive any protocol 
treatment. In all, 86 patients did not receive ad-
juvant temozolomide: 31 had symptomatic pro-
gression before adjuvant therapy, 25 had inter-
current illness, 11 had adverse effects related to 
temozolomide, 9 declined treatment, 8 died, 1 was 
not adherent to treatment, and 1 was removed 
after randomization and received a full course of 
radiotherapy plus temozolomide. After disease 
progression, 197 of 493 patients (40.0%) received 
other anticancer therapies, and the percentage of 
patients was similar in the two groups. As ex-
pected, temozolomide was more commonly used 
in the radiotherapy-alone group, and non-temozo-
lomide systemic therapies were more commonly 
used in the radiotherapy-plus-temozolomide group. 
(For details, see the Supplementary Appendix.)
Toxic Effects
Toxic effects were assessed according to the 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, 
version 3.0, and were as expected with temozolo-
mide. As expected, radiotherapy plus temozolo-
mide was associated with a slightly higher rate of 
adverse events than radiotherapy alone; the worst 
recorded hematologic toxic effects are listed in 
Table 2. The rates of grade 3 or 4 events were as 
follows: lymphopenia, 27.2% with radiotherapy 
plus temozolomide versus 10.3% with radiother-
apy alone; thrombocytopenia, 11.1% versus 0.4%; 
and neutropenia, 8.3% versus 0.8%. Low-grade 
opportunistic infection was reported in 2 patients 
who received radiotherapy plus temozolomide, 
with no other significant between-group dif-
ferences in reported infections. Serious adverse 
events leading to death were reported in 38 pa-
tients who received radiotherapy plus temozolo-
mide and in 35 patients who received radio-
therapy alone; two of these events in each group

Short-Course Radiation plus Temozolomide in Glioblastoma
were attributed by the investigators to treatment, 
with the rest due to disease progression.
Overall Survival
The Kaplan–Meier estimates of median overall 
survival were 9.3 months with radiotherapy plus 
temozolomide and 7.6 months with radiotherapy 
alone (Fig. 2A). The risk of death was lower by 
33% with radiotherapy plus temozolomide than 
with radiotherapy alone (hazard ratio, 0.67; 95% 
CI, 0.56 to 0.80; P<0.001). In Cox regression 
modeling with adjustment for baseline factors, 
radiotherapy plus temozolomide remained signifi-
cantly better than radiotherapy alone with respect 
to overall survival, with an estimated hazard ratio 
of 0.67 (95% CI, 0.56 to 0.80; P<0.001). Baseline 
factors that correlated with overall survival in-
cluded the extent of resection and MMSE score: 
patients with biopsy only had shorter survival 
than those with partial or complete resection 
(hazard ratio for death, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.38 to 2.02; 
P<0.001), and patients with higher MMSE scores 
had longer survival than those with lower scores 
(hazard ratio for death with a 1-unit increase as a

continuous variable, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.94 to 0.98; 
P<0.001).
In proportional-hazard models assessing the 
interaction between treatment and stratification 
factors, treatment effect appeared to increase mar-
ginally with age. Patients 65 to 70 years of age 
derived less benefit from the addition of temo-
zolomide than those 71 to 75 years of age or 76 
years of age or older (P 
= 
0.06 for interaction). 
Among patients 65 to 70 years of age, the median 
overall survival was 8.7 months with radiotherapy 
plus temozolomide and 8.3 months with radio-
therapy alone (hazard ratio for death, 0.93; 95% 
CI, 0.68 to 1.27). Among patients 71 to 75 years of 
age, the median overall survival was 9.3 months 
versus 7.6 months (hazard ratio, 0.63; 95% CI, 
0.48 to 0.83). Among patients 76 years of age or 
older, the median overall survival was 10.0 months 
versus 7.1 months (hazard ratio, 0.53; 95% CI, 
0.38 to 0.73). No significant differences of treat-
ment effect across levels of other stratification 
factors were observed. Exploratory analyses of 
overall survival at 12, 18, and 24 months favored 
radiotherapy plus temozolomide over radiother-
apy alone at all time points (Table 3).
Progression-free Survival
The median progression-free survival was 5.3 
months with radiotherapy plus temozolomide as 
compared with 3.9 months with radiotherapy 
alone (hazard ratio for disease progression or 
death, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.60; P<0.001) (Fig. 2B). 
A Cox regression model adjusting for other base-
line factors showed that radiotherapy plus temo-
zolomide remained significantly better than 
radiotherapy alone with respect to progression-
free survival (hazard ratio, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.43 to 
0.63; P<0.001). Baseline factors that correlated 
with progression-free survival included the ex-
tent of resection and MMSE score; patients with 
biopsy only had shorter progression-free survival 
than those with partial or complete resection 
(hazard ratio, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.20 to 1.75; P<0.001), 
and patients with higher MMSE scores had lon-
ger progression-free survival than those with 
lower scores (hazard ratio with a 1-unit increase 
as a continuous variable, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.95 to 
0.98; P<0.001). As with overall survival, younger 
age was associated with less benefit from treat-
ment (hazard ratios, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.55 to 1.05] 
for patients 65 to 70 years of age vs. 0.42 [95% 
CI, 0.3 to 0.57] for patients 71 to 75 years of age 
vs. 0.49 [95% CI, 0.35 to 0.68] for patients ≥76 
years of age; P 
= 
0.02).
Results According to MGMT Status
A total of 462 tissue samples were able to be 
evaluated in an MGMT gene promoter analysis, 
and MGMT results were successfully obtained 
from 354 samples (181 from patients assigned to 
radiotherapy plus temozolomide and 173 from 
patients assigned to radiotherapy alone). In the 
radiotherapy-alone group, MGMT status was not 
a prognostic factor (overall survival, 7.9 months 
with unmethylated status and 7.7 months with 
methylated status; hazard ratio for death with

Short-Course Radiation plus Temozolomide in Glioblastoma
unmethylated status, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.68 to 1.21; 
P 
= 
0.64). As anticipated, MGMT status predicted 
longer survival with radiotherapy plus temozolo-
mide than with radiotherapy alone. Although the 
greatest benefit was observed in patients with 
methylated MGMT status (median survival, 13.5 
months with radiotherapy plus temozolomide vs. 
7.7 months with radiotherapy alone; hazard ratio, 
0.53; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.73; P<0.001), a clinically 
meaningful overall survival advantage, which did 
not reach statistical significance, was also ob-
served in patients with unmethylated MGMT sta-
tus (median survival, 10.0 months vs. 7.9 months; 
hazard ratio, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.56 to 1.01; P 
= 
0.055; 
P 
= 
0.08 for interaction) (Fig. S19 and S20 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). In addition, a survival 
advantage was observed at 12, 18, and 24 months 
in patients with methylated MGMT status (Table 3).
Quality of Life
Baseline quality-of-life scores for symptom and 
function domains were similar in the two groups. 
Nausea and constipation were worse during 
chemoradiotherapy than during radiotherapy 
alone, but changes in the scores on all other 
symptom and function domains were similar in 
the two groups. We conducted further quality-
of-life analyses using time to deterioration (with 
deterioration defined as a 10-point decrease in 
the score on the function domain or a 10-point 
increase in the score on the symptom domain) 
and plots of quality-of-life scores over time (Fig. S1 
to S18 in the Supplementary Appendix). In this 
trial involving elderly patients with glioblastoma, 
disease progression occurred early, and the ad-
herence rate for completion of instruments re-
ported by the patient declined during the trial, 
as expected. Because the number of data points 
decreased over time, it is problematic to use 
more complex models for these analyses. As in 
the overall quality-of-life response analysis, only 
nausea and vomiting and constipation were as-
sociated with significant differences in time to 
deterioration (shorter in the radiotherapy-plus-
temozolomide group than in the radiotherapy-
alone group), and there was a significantly 
greater treatment-by-time interaction in the radio-
therapy-plus-temozolomide group than in the 
radiotherapy-alone group for nausea and vomit-
ing and constipation. There were no other clini-
cally important differences between trial groups, 
which supports our observation that quality of 
life was similar in the two treatment groups.
Discussion
In this phase 3 trial, the addition of temozolo-
mide to short-course radiotherapy was associat-
ed with significantly longer progression-free and 
overall survival than short-course radiotherapy 
alone among patients 65 years of age or older 
with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. In subgroup 
analyses, the benefit of chemoradiotherapy was 
particularly evident in patients with methylated 
MGMT status, in whom median survival with 
temozolomide added to short-course radiotherapy 
was nearly twice that with short-course radio-
therapy alone, but benefit was also observed 
in patients with unmethylated MGMT status 
(P 
= 
0.055). The survival advantage of temozolo-
mide was conferred without a sacrifice in qual-
ity of life and with manageable chemotherapy-
related toxic effects.
There has been no clear standard of care for 
the treatment of glioblastoma in the elderly.13 
Practice patterns show less use of surgical resec-
tion, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy with in-
creasing age.14-16 However, elderly patients with 
glioblastoma have been shown to benefit from 
these treatments. One trial randomly assigned 
85 patients 70 years of age or older (median, 73 
years; range, 70 to 85) to either postoperative 
radiotherapy (50.4 Gy in 28 fractions) plus sup-
portive care or supportive care alone.6 Those who 
received radiotherapy plus supportive care had 
longer overall survival than those who received 
supportive care alone (median, 6.7 months vs. 
3.9 months), with no significant differences in 
quality of life or in cognition. Shorter-course 
hypofractionated radiotherapy is commonly used 
in the elderly, because it appears to be at least as 
effective as longer-duration radiotherapy.6,17,18 In-
deed, in the Nordic Clinical Brain Tumour Study 
Group (NCBTSG) trial, patients 60 years of age 
or older who were randomly assigned to a longer 
course of radiotherapy had worse outcomes than 
those assigned to a shorter course of radiother-
apy or temozolomide chemotherapy.7 Adherence 
was worse in the group assigned to 6 weeks of 
radiotherapy; only 72 of 100 patients (72.0%) in 
that group, as compared with 93 of 98 (94.9%) 
in the hypofractionated radiotherapy group,

completed the assigned therapy. Dropout was 
usually due to clinical worsening or disease pro-
gression.
The use of chemotherapy in elderly patients 
with glioblastoma is associated with improved 
survival, especially in patients with MGMT meth-
ylated status.19-22 The NOA-08 randomized trial 
compared temozolomide alone with 6 weeks of 
radiotherapy alone in patients 65 years of age or 
older with malignant glioma.8 Overall survival 
was similar in the two groups (8.6 months with 
temozolomide and 9.6 months with radiother-
apy). The longest survival was observed among 
patients with methylated MGMT status who were 
assigned to temozolomide alone. Similarly, in the 
NCBTSG trial, the median overall survival was 
9.7 months among patients with methylated 
MGMT status who were assigned to the temo-
zolomide group. Survival was similar among all 
patients assigned to temozolomide or short-course 
radiotherapy and was significantly longer than 
among patients assigned to 6-week radiotherapy 
(8.3 months with temozolomide, 7.5 months 
with short-course radiotherapy, and 6.0 months 
with 6-week radiotherapy).7 Taken together with 
our results, these findings suggest that abbrevi-
ated radiotherapy schedules are effective and in-
clude the benefit of high completion rates and 
reduced treatment time for patients who often 
have short survival and limited mobility.
Given the detrimental effect of increasing age 
on survival in patients with glioblastoma, it is 
surprising that patients 70 years of age or young-
er appeared to benefit somewhat less than older 
patients in our trial. Our decision to include 
patients as young as 65 years of age was based 
on current practice in our centers and on the 
results of previous randomized studies suggest-
ing less benefit of radiotherapy plus temozolo-
mide in patients 65 to 70 years of age than in 
younger patients. We recognized that patients 
65 to 70 years of age may still be offered a full 
6-week course of radiotherapy plus temozolo-
mide, so we deliberately included only patients 
who were deemed to be unfit for that schedule. 
Whether the patient met this criterion was deter-
mined on the basis of the considered opinion of 
the treating physician and patient preferences for 
care. It is therefore possible that our subgroup 
of patients 65 to 70 years of age was enriched 
with patients who were more likely to have worse 
outcomes. That said, we were unable to detect any 
significant differences between age subgroups 
in known prognostic factors, such as extent of 
resection, MGMT status, ECOG performance 
status, quality of life, or score on the MMSE.
