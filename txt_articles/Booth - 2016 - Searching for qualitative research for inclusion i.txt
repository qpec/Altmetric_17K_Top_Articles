Searching for qualitative research for
inclusion in systematic reviews: a
structured methodological review
Andrew Booth
Abstract
Background: Qualitative systematic reviews or qualitative evidence syntheses (QES) are increasingly recognised as a
way to enhance the value of systematic reviews (SRs) of clinical trials. They can explain the mechanisms by which
interventions, evaluated within trials, might achieve their effect. They can investigate differences in effects between
different population groups. They can identify which outcomes are most important to patients, carers, health
professionals and other stakeholders. QES can explore the impact of acceptance, feasibility, meaningfulness
and implementation-related factors within a real world setting and thus contribute to the design and further
refinement of future interventions. To produce valid, reliable and meaningful QES requires systematic identification of
relevant qualitative evidence. Although the methodologies of QES, including methods for information retrieval, are
well-documented, little empirical evidence exists to inform their conduct and reporting.
Methods: This structured methodological overview examines papers on searching for qualitative research identified
from the Cochrane Qualitative and Implementation Methods Group Methodology Register and from citation searches
of 15 key papers.
Results: A single reviewer reviewed 1299 references. Papers reporting methodological guidance, use of innovative
methodologies or empirical studies of retrieval methods were categorised under eight topical headings: overviews and
methodological guidance, sampling, sources, structured questions, search procedures, search strategies and filters,
supplementary strategies and standards.
Conclusions: This structured overview presents a contemporaneous view of information retrieval for qualitative
research and identifies a future research agenda. This review concludes that poor empirical evidence underpins current
information practice in information retrieval of qualitative research. A trend towards improved transparency of search
methods and further evaluation of key search procedures offers the prospect of rapid development of search methods.
Keywords: Qualitative research, Systematic reviews, Literature searching
Background
The contribution of qualitative evidence to health care
decision-making is increasingly acknowledged. Qualita-
tive evidence syntheses (QES) now occupy an important
role within the activities of international collaborations,
such as the Cochrane Collaboration [1], as part of the
guidance production processes of national organisations
such as the UK National Institute for Health and Clinical
Excellence (NICE) and the US Agency for Healthcare
Research and Quality (AHRQ) and as a genuine aca-
demic endeavour funded by private, public and charit-
able funding bodies. Increasingly, QES are viewed as a
putative mechanism by which the systematic review “cat-
echism” can be advanced from “what works” to “what
happens” [2]. Milestones for the development of QES
methodology are well-documented [3]. They include the
publication of the first methodology for qualitative syn-
thesis (meta-ethnography) in 1988 [4], the formal recog-
nition
of
the

 Methods Group in 2006 and publication of the first
Cochrane QES in 2013 [5].
Data compiled for the annual Evidence Synthesis of
Qualitative Research in Europe (ESQUIRE) workshop in
2015 suggests that between 40 and 70 qualitative synthe-
ses are published each month across a wide range of disci-
plines with 2–5 methodological references on qualitative
synthesis appearing within the same period.
The most cited QES methodological guidance is Chapter
20 of the Cochrane Handbook, authored by co-convenors
of the Cochrane Qualitative Methods Group [6]. This was
the first document to recognise the potentially important
role of qualitative research within the Collaboration. Space
constraints limited the searching section to three para-
graphs which covered the usefulness of filters, the import-
ance of supplementary searching strategies, an early
attempt to highlight the importance of sampling decisions
and a cursory sentence on reporting standards. Following
receipt of a methodology grant and subsequent methodo-
logical summit in Adelaide, the Cochrane Qualitative
Methods Group produced supplementary guidance hosted
on the Group’s Website. Chapter 3 of this supplementary
guidance covered searching for studies [7] mirroring the
trial-focused chapter on searching from the Cochrane
Handbook. Then, Cochrane policies confined qualitative
research to a supporting role within collaboration activities
[3] which resulted in potentially useful guidance on supple-
mentary approaches to searching being relegated to an
Appendix.
At about this time, the Centre for Reviews and Dissemin-
ation was revising its guidance on conducting systematic
reviews. For the first time, a chapter on qualitative system-
atic reviews was included in this seminal guidance. Chapter
6 entitled “Incorporating qualitative evidence in or along-
side effectiveness reviews” consisted of 20 pages including
just over two pages related to identification of the evidence
[8]. Topics covered included a characterisation of search
procedures, single paragraphs on sampling approaches and
supplementary strategies, respectively, a lengthy discussion
of search strategies and filters and a single sentence on
reporting standards.
Despite considerable advances in QES methodology,
many gaps remain to be addressed. While this is true for
all stages of the review process, the place of searching at
the beginning of the process renders it a particular prior-
ity. Our knowledge of searching for qualitative research
is founded primarily on custom and practice. Very few
empirical studies exist to inform information retrieval
practice. Consequently, we have an imperfect knowledge
of the most effective retrieval terms, partial understand-
ing of the respective yield of different sources and, in
particular, an incomplete insight of the appropriateness
of different sampling methods as they relate to different
types of QES.
This methodological review was compiled to support
the work of the author and other co-convenors of the
Cochrane
Qualitative
and
Implementation
Methods
Group in writing updated guidance on literature search-
ing for qualitative evidence. In conjunction with a pend-
ing major revision of the Group’s chapter in the
Cochrane Handbook, the co-convenors of the Group
have developed a publishing plan for supplementary
guidance, including a chapter on searching. This meth-
odological overview does not duplicate the forthcoming
guidance. It documents the evidence base that will in-
form the guidance, much as a systematic review might
inform subsequent clinical guidelines. The aim is to pro-
duce a summary of the evidence base for searching for
QES that is not constrained by current interpretations of
the role of QES within the Cochrane Collaboration. Such
a methodological summary may conceivably inform
handbooks and other guidance as produced by health
technology assessment (HTA) agencies, guideline pro-
ducers and other review organisations.
Specifically, the author sought to address three meth-
odological questions:
� What is the current state of knowledge in relation to
this aspect of searching practice?
� How robust is the evidence base for this aspect of
searching practice?
� What are the main gaps and future research
priorities for this aspect of searching practice?
Methods
Systematic approaches to searching may be typified by
seven characteristics (“the 7S structure”). As highlighted
in a recent paper, systematic retrieval requires a trans-
parent method for producing a structured review ques-
tion, the availability of search strategies (or filters) to
assist in sifting relevant studies from those likely to be
irrelevant, and replicable and evidence-based search
procedures that can be enhanced and adapted to each
particular review [9]. An additional challenge is associ-
ated with choosing which sources to search and learning
the idiosyncrasies of each source [10]. These require-
ments extend to three further characteristics—standards
for reporting search strategies, an informed strategy for
sampling studies and judicious use of supplementary
search methods. These seven characteristics were used
to structure findings from the review, following a sum-
mary of existing overviews and guidance for information
retrieval in QES.
Typically, a methodological review requires the con-
duct of sensitive searches across multiple databases.
However, for the last 7 years, the author has maintained
the study register of the Cochrane Qualitative and Im-
plementation Methods Group. This is populated on a

 monthly basis by sensitive keyword searches of PubMed
MEDLINE (Appendix) and the ISI Web of Science and
by citation searches for key methodological books and
journals on ISI Web of Science and Google Scholar. Ref-
erence lists from new articles and book chapters are
checked regularly for further additions to the register.
The register is the single most comprehensive database
source of (i) methodological references on all aspects of
QES and (ii) published examples of QES. A sensitive
search was therefore conducted of the study register on
Reference Manager 12 using such terms as “search*,”
“retriev*” and “database*.” Six hundred fifty-four refer-
ences were retrieved, and these were reviewed for rele-
vance by the author. A high proportion of references
were anticipated to be “false hits” as they reported the
search methods used for specific QES. However, this
sensitive search strategy increased confidence that all
relevant methodological sources would be retrieved.
Previous guidance on searching for qualitative evi-
dence was used to compile a list of 15 key citation pearls
on various aspects of retrieval. A citation pearl is an
authoritative article, typically identified by experts, of
particular relevance to the topic of inquiry that can be
used to search for relevant and authoritative materials
sharing common characteristics with the original pearl
[11]. Searches on Google Scholar using each title in
quotation marks were used to identify all references citing
these pearls (i.e. as indicated with “Cited By”). Including
duplicates, 1063 references were identified from these 15
citation pearls (Table 1). Therefore, 1717 references were
identified through the two search approaches. Once dupli-
cates were removed, 1299 records were available.
Relevant references were coded under one or more of
eight headings used to structure this review, namely Over-
views and Methodological Guidance, Sampling, Sources,
Structured Questions, Search Procedures, Search Strat-
egies and Filters, Supplementary Strategies and Standards.
Searching, sifting and coding were conducted in July/
August 2015 [10, 12–25].
The author examined the full-texts of all items identified
for inclusion from the searches, most having been previ-
ously assembled to support the methodological work of
the Cochrane Qualitative and Implementation Methods
Group. Two types of evidence were used in compiling this
structured methodological review. Empirical studies were
examined to assess their practical implications for those
conducting QES. Methodological commentaries, over-
views and guidance handbooks were inspected in order to
construct a snapshot of current practice.
Data to answer the three review questions was ex-
tracted into a single spreadsheet using Google Forms.
The 7S framework was used as a structure for data ex-
traction. Narrative text extracts from each article were
cut and pasted into the data extraction framework. In
addition, papers were categorised for study design and
empirical studies examined for the quality of their de-
sign. A narrative commentary was produced to summar-
ise both the included references and findings from the
extracted data.
Results
A total of 113 items were identified for inclusion in the
methodological review [10, 12–120]. Of these, 46 were
characterised as overviews of QES methodology, 13 rep-
resented formal guidance on conduct or reporting with a
further 3 being narrative reviews specifically of the QES
search process. One paper was a short general summary
and could thus not be classified as an overview in the lit-
eral sense. Seven papers used a hybrid design that com-
bined an overview with one (n = 4) or multiple (n = 2)
case studies and, in one case, with both a survey and a
case study. The remaining 43 papers employed a formal
study design and are described more fully below.
With regard to the seven components of the 7S frame-
work, the papers were distributed as follows: Sampling
(n = 47), Sources (n = 22), Structured Questions (n = 17),
Search procedures (n = 6), Search Strategies and Filters
(n = 16), Supplementary Strategies (n = 24), and Standards
(n = 17). The aggregate number of papers exceeded 131
items indicating that some papers, particularly overviews,
contributed to more than one of the 7S components
(Fig. 1—flow chart). Although conclusions based simply

 on “vote-counting” should be resisted, it is noteworthy
that issues of sampling are frequently discussed, in marked
contrast to a default of comprehensive sampling typically
used when conducting quantitative systematic reviews. In
comparison with quantitative systematic reviews, there
was also greater emphasis on the use of a variety of
sources and of supplementary search methods.
With regard to the quality of the included papers, it
was not possible to perform quality assessment for the
body of included papers because (i) many papers were
narrative offerings (n = 68) and (ii) even where a formal
study design (n = 43) was present, the heterogeneity of
these designs and the lack of a common appraisal instru-
ment made comparability across studies prohibitively
challenging. Observations on the robustness of the evi-
dence base for each aspect of searching practice were
therefore constrained to types of supporting designs.
Specific observations are included within each of the
following component sections. However, overall, the
studies can be characterised as follows: case study (25);
comparative study (7); literature surveys (5); multiple
case studies (1); surveys (1); and validation study (4).
Unsurprisingly, case studies of individual QES were the
most common investigative design with a single paper
reporting multiple case studies within the same paper.
Five literature surveys identified a set of eligible studies
and then examined reporting of methods within the
study set. One study surveyed those who conduct litera-
ture searches. In terms of more robust designs, seven
studies used a comparative design and four studies in-
vestigating the use of search filters attempted validation
against a gold standard.
Many authors document the perceived complexity of
searching for qualitative research, either in comparison
with quantitative research (particularly randomised con-
trolled trials) [8, 14, 36, 39] or in its own right [10, 25].
As a consequence, searching for, and identifying, appro-
priate qualitative research is characterised as “frustrating
and difficult” [22]. Table 2 summarises the most fre-
quently documented challenges.
While some challenges are being addressed, for ex-
ample with the addition of the Medical Subject Heading

 (MeSH) term to MEDLINE in “Qualitative Research” in
2003 [34] and with the trend towards more informative
titles and abstracts, progress appears slower than in the
more researched domain of quantitative research. Estab-
lished methods for identifying quantitative research do
not necessarily translate into effective strategies for
qualitative research [34]. Dixon-Woods et al. [30] re-
ported that 23 % of records screened for a qualitative
review of support for breastfeeding did not include an
abstract. As a consequence, a higher proportion of full-
text articles may need to be screened to make decisions
about inclusion [45].
Overviews, summaries and guidance
For inclusion in this section, a publication (i.e. peer-
reviewed book chapter, journal article or report) was
required to either (i) provide an overview of the entire
literature searching process, or substantive components
of this process, in the specific context of qualitative
research or (ii) attempt a methodological overview or
analysis of one or more methods of qualitative synthesis
including a consideration of literature searching methods.
Forty-six items were overviews of QES methodology
[14, 15, 18, 26–28, 30–32, 35, 36, 38, 43, 47–51, 53–
55, 57–59, 61, 63, 64, 66, 67, 69, 70, 75–79, 83, 85,
86, 89, 91, 98, 99, 102, 103, 113], and further seven
overviews were combined with one [10, 29, 41, 52] or
multiple case studies [37, 40] and, in one instance,
with both a survey and a case study [46]. Thirteen
papers represented guidance on conduct or reporting
[6–8, 33, 34] [80, 88, 97, 100, 117–120], three were
narrative reviews of the QES search process only
[106, 111, 112] and there was one general summary [71].
These overview texts reflect a range of approaches to
literature searching. Some simply translate the compre-
hensive model for quantitative studies to a qualitative
context [47]. However, increasingly, overviews acknow-
ledge differences between aggregative and configurative
reviews [48] and the respective merits of comprehensive
and purposive sampling [49].
Sampling
For inclusion in this section, a publication was required to
either (i) provide an overview of sampling in the context
of QES or (ii) include a substantive discussion of the topic
of sampling within a published synthesis, or (iii) mention
sampling within works identified for the “Overviews, sum-
maries and guidance” section. Forty-seven items were thus
included in this section [4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 30, 32, 34, 35, 37,
38, 40, 42, 45–47, 49–66, 68–76, 78–80, 82].
While there is general agreement on the need for
search strategies to be systematic and explicit, recent
debate focuses on whether QES share the need for com-
prehensive, exhaustive searches [69]. Some argue that a
more purposive sampling approach, aiming to provide a
holistic interpretation of a phenomenon, where the
extent of searching is driven by the need to reach theor-
etical saturation rather than to identify all eligible studies
[6, 30, 34, 46], might be more appropriate. Systematic
reviews of qualitative research inhabit the point at which
two research traditions meet [38]. On the one hand, the
methodology of systematic reviews, developed princi-
pally over the last two decades, has been dominated by
quantitative systematic reviews. Systematic reviews (SRs)
of trials attempt to locate every possible study on a given
topic or intervention [35]. Some authors [10, 63] advo-
cate a similar approach for QES. On the other hand,
Booth [54] argues that, rather than adopting a “trials-
type search,” authors should use a “theory” driven ap-
proach, resembling “diversity” or “saturation” sampling
approaches used in primary qualitative studies. The in-
terpretive nature of QES suggests the value of methods
derived from primary qualitative research, such as the
use of theoretical sampling until data saturation is
reached [54]. Whereas in quantitative meta-analysis,
omission of a key paper is critical to statistically drawn

Campbell et al. affirm that “omission of some papers is
unlikely to have a dramatic effect on the results” [37].
The creative tension that results from bringing together
these two traditions, labelled as a “dual heritage” [38], is
most clearly seen in the literature that describes how to
select an appropriate sample.
Selection of an appropriate sample of participants is
fundamental to quantitative and qualitative research
[121]. Similarly, selection of an appropriate sample of
papers is essential for a successful evidence synthesis
[38]. In quantitative reviews, this is typically framed in
terms of a “comprehensive” sample, by implication a
universal sample, to minimise bias and to permit subse-
quent generalisation. Conceptually, however, a compre-
hensive sample is problematic as it constrained by the
number and type of resources to be searched, the diver-
sity of materials contained within such sources and the
time available. Recently, I proposed that “exhaustive” be
preferred over “comprehensive” because it conveys the
finite nature of resources (e.g. searcher time, money, and
access to databases; time to sift). “Exhaustive” is relative
to the purpose and type of review rather than referen-
cing some mythical absolute [76]. However, such debate
is clouded by the tendency to use “comprehensive” and
“exhaustive” interchangeably. Brunton et al. [76] observe
that “exhaustive searching is improbable,…the obligation
on reviewers is to plan a thoughtful and clearly de-
scribed plan [sic] to locate the sample of studies most
likely to answer their research question[s] reliably.” Key
difficulties include how to establish the population of
potentially relevant studies without identifying all rele-
vant studies [45]. Data or theoretical “saturation” could
have limitations in this context; importantly, how can a
reviewer know that an additional study will not add
important insights? [46].
Early commentators expressed anxiety that selective
sampling may result in the omission of relevant data, thus
limiting understanding of the phenomenon [50, 53, 60].
Gallacher et al. [40] characterise two schools: those who
advocate using purposeful sampling to retrieve materials
until data saturation is reached [51] and those who aim to
retrieve all relevant studies in a field rather than a sample
of them [8]. The first approach has logistic and epistemo-
logical drivers and is often taken when review teams face a
large and diverse set of resources [61] or when they are
developing concepts and theories [65].
Studies aimed at comprehensively summarising the lit-
erature include a comprehensive and rigorous search
using predefined index/subject heading/free-text terms,
informed by an initial scoping search [10, 30, 64]. Thus,
aggregative reviews, characterised by the Joanna Briggs In-
stitute’s proprietorial meta-aggregation method, explicitly
seek to mirror the breadth of sources included within an
effectiveness review [49]. Such an approach facilitates
comparability between quantitative and qualitative out-
puts. However, it pays scant recognition to the different
epistemological traditions underpinning different types of
qualitative synthesis.
For a qualitative reviewer, time is best spent not “piling
up examples of the same finding, but in identifying studies
that contain new conceptualisations of the phenomena of
interest” [76]. Notwithstanding good methodological justi-
fications for searching comprehensively in SRs of trials,
not least to protect against systematic errors such as pub-
lication bias [76, 80], qualitative data collection is charac-
terised, not by “statistical representativeness” but by
“systematic non-probabilistic sampling” [122]. Several au-
thors [52, 54, 55, 65] suggest drawing on the sampling
techniques of primary qualitative research, including the-
oretical sampling and theoretical saturation, when synthe-
sising qualitative literature. Booth [54] states that the
intention of QES is not to identify all literature on a par-
ticular topic, the aim being identification of papers with
characteristics relevant to the phenomenon being studied,
not statistical representativeness [54]. Innovative tech-
niques might be “borrowed” from primary qualitative re-
search such as deliberately seeking studies to act as
negative cases, aiming for maximum variability and de-
signing results set to be heterogeneous, as an alternative
to “the homogeneity that is often the aim in statistical
meta-analyses” [32].
Downe [71] describes how theoretical saturation might
be operationalised in terms of whether additional studies
continue to reinforce the line of argument. Under such
circumstances, the author reasons, a search for new
studies will reap increasingly diminutive returns, offering
justification for truncating the search. O’Connell and
Downe [73] describe how they identified a point of the-
oretical saturation “when two articles identified late in
the search process did not add anything new to the
emerging synthesis.” One reviewer reflects that their
background as a quantitative systematic reviewer pushed
them towards a higher threshold: “I support the ‘data
saturation approach’ and think if the next twenty papers
don’t offer anything new, what’s the likelihood of the
21st (reflexive statement)” [46]. A more mechanical, ra-
ther than interpretive, interpretation of saturation relates
to the recurrence of studies, rather than themes [63], as
references to the same study begin to reappear repeatedly.
The benchmark of a comprehensive sampling frame
persists despite the methodological innovation offered
by purposive and theoretical sampling approaches. Add-
ing additional electronic databases to a search protocol
(i.e. to search for more of the same) [22] runs counter to
the strategy of seeking to diversify a sample (i.e. purpos-
ively to move on to different, more productive lines of

 inquiry). Several authors comment on the value of iden-
tifying the disconfirming case [30, 38, 54, 71], and search
strategies may be targeted specifically to achieve such
insights [38].
A reconciled position would state that the sampling
method should be appropriate to the type of review and
its purpose. The Centre for Reviews and Dissemination
(CRD) guidance recognises the absence of consensus
over the issue of sampling [8]. Rather than predicate
their guidance on epistemological concerns, they suggest
that if the number of studies is too large to work
through, researchers may decide to adopt a strategy for
limiting the number of included studies. Purposive and/
or theoretical sampling are the main choices, with pa-
pers selected for inclusion on the basis of such criteria
as rich description or conceptual clarity [8]. The guid-
ance highlights a role for random sampling, probably
most appropriate when constructing a test set for a
methodological investigation. Cited examples include
purposive
sampling
derived
from
qualitative
meta-
synthesis [58] and critical interpretive synthesis [65].
Reconceptualising literature searching for QES, and
indeed knowledge synthesis more generally, around the
appropriateness of the sample rather than its complete-
ness opens up an exciting variety of sampling approaches
derived from qualitative research [78, 79]. Patton’s 16
strategies [123] could ultimately be matched to the full
range of synthesis types in an expanded version of Table 3
and then translated into corresponding search techniques
for each sampling method.
How many studies are enough?
A further cause for debate relates to the number of stud-
ies to include within a QES [34, 71]. Some methods of
synthesis, such as meta-aggregation and meta-study,
make a virtue of being able to handle large numbers of
studies. More interpretive approaches privilege smaller
numbers of studies [12, 71]. While it is undesirable to
talk in terms of specific numbers [124], the amount of
relevant data may be a function both of the number of
studies and their conceptual richness and contextual
thickness [8]. Furthermore, data considered rich and
thick in relation to one aspect of the review question
may be scarce in relation to another aspect, even within
the same set of studies. Too few studies may limit the
support for the entire synthesis or for individual con-
stituent themes. Too many included studies may impair
the data analysis, making conceptual analysis “unwieldy”
or making it difficult to maintain insight or “sufficient
familiarity,” [37] thereby obscuring patterns that are ap-
parent within a smaller set of studies [46, 59, 68]. In
seeking such a balance, we typically arrive at a preferred
number of between 6 and 14 studies. Campbell et al.
[37] suggest that “a maximum of about 40 papers is
realistic because it is difficult to maintain sufficient
familiarity with >40 papers when trying to synthesise
them all….” Where the number of studies to be included
falls short of the total population of eligible studies, for
whatever reason, it becomes critical that “reviewers ex-
plicitly and transparently state their criteria for including
studies” [34].
When can I stop searching?
In qualitative research, analysis and data collection occur
simultaneously, often to the point where no new ideas
are developing [46]. Thus, it is unlikely that a reviewer
can pre-specify a set number of studies without consid-
ering their richness, thickness and overall quality. For
situations other than exhaustive sampling, a reviewer
must develop clear explanations for the circumstances
under which searching was terminated. Stopping rules
have been proposed, initially for methodological reviews,
but these may apply, by extension, to reviews that seek
to achieve saturation [82]. Quantitative reviewers cur-
rently seek methods to define a point beyond which fur-
ther literature searching has little justification [30]. For
qualitative reviews, the answer may lie in the principles
of data saturation [30].
Sampling issues
The use of alternatives to comprehensive searching po-
tentially creates several problems, particularly where a
reviewer has chosen to locate their QES within a system-
atic review paradigm [34]. Some commentators express
concern that alternative sampling approaches open a
QES to allegations of subjective decision-making [75] or
assertions that such reviews are no longer transparent or
reproducible [30, 34]. Others respond that “systematic”
should not be misappropriated to favour one research
system over an equally legitimate alternative [38]. Never-
theless, pressure to observe quantitative systematic re-
view conventions persists with 81 % of published
meta-ethnographies using exhaustive search strategies
[42]—this for a methodology that, as seen in Table 3,
recognises the appropriateness of purposive sampling
approaches.
Indeed,
the
originators
of
the
meta-
ethnographic approach caution against exhaustive inclu-
sion of data as it is likely to lead to over-generalisation
and “trite conclusions” [4].
Just as there is no consensus regarding the number of
interviews required for a “good” qualitative study, there
is no consensus on what type of sample is required for a
good qualitative synthesis [46]. France et al. [42] identify
a need for further exploration of those circumstances
under which exhaustive searches are desirable or neces-
sary. Pragmatically, review teams need to bear in mind,
when sampling, the underlying theoretical perspective
together with a need to be explicit about any strengths

 Table 3 Synthesis methods with appropriate sampling methods
Synthesis method
Description
Sampling method
Rationale for sampling method
Critical interpretive
synthesis
A method of synthesis that offers a means of systematically
producing explanatory theories directly from the data.
(1) Purposive sampling;
(2) Theoretical sampling [65]
(1) Purposive sampling of representative cases used to immerse
team in area of investigation.
(2) Followed up by pursuit of further lines of theoretical inquiry.
Grounded theory-
based approaches
An interpretive approach to synthesis that is modelled on the
primary research methods of grounded theory.
Theoretical sampling [34]
Further lines of inquiry and hence routes for searching emerge
from ongoing analysis of the data and hence require follow up
along lines suggested by theory.
Meta-aggregation
A structured, process-driven approach to systematic review of
qualitative research modelled on the conventional systematic
review of quantitative literature as practised by the Cochrane
and Campbell Collaboration.
Comprehensive sampling [49, 68]
Seeks to identify all relevant studies in order to establish credibility
in conventional systematic review terms.
Meta-ethnography
An interpretive method for synthesising qualitative research
of particular value in developing models that interpret findings
across multiple studies.
Purposive sampling [56, 57]
Theoretical sampling [34]
Interpretive focus places premium on identifying studies to contribute
added value over and above current version of synthesis and thus requires
sampling on a theoretical basis.
Meta-interpretation A meta-synthetic approach used specifically in interpretative
synthesis.
Maximal divergent sampling/maximum
variation sampling [70, 72]; Theoretical
sampling [70]
Focus on interpretation requires that insights are maximised by
exploring papers that are not characteristic of the “average sample.”
Meta-narrative
synthesis
Takes paradigmatic approach to map literatures from different
research traditions.
Purposive sampling of key papers
[35, 62]
Seeks an illuminative sample of papers from within different research
traditions.
Qualitative meta-
synthesis
Attempts to integrate results from multiple different but
inter-related qualitative studies with interpretive, rather than
aggregating, intent, in contrast to meta-analysis of quantitative
studies.
Comprehensive (representative)
sampling [55]
Patterned on conventional systematic review methods therefore
seeks all relevant studies to represent entire phenomenon of interest.
Realist synthesis
Approach to complex social interventions or programmes which
provides explanatory analysis aimed at discerning what works for
whom, in what circumstances, in what respects and how.
At different points uses variously:
(a) Comprehensive sampling [74];
(b) Purposive sampling [66];
(c) Theoretical sampling [34];
(d) Snowball sampling [61]
Comprehensive sampling (a) used to explore key focus of review.
Becomes starting point for more explanatory exploration (b–d) of
associated literature and mechanisms.
Scoping review
Rapid review that aims to map existing literature in a field of
interest in terms of volume, nature, and characteristics of
primary research.
Random sampling [74]
Aims to characterise literature, not to document studies in minute
detail, sampling representative body of literature may suffice for
planning purposes.
Booth Systematic Reviews  (2016) 5:74 
Page 8 of 23
 and weaknesses of their approach [71]. This includes a
requirement to communicate their sampling approach,
methods used and the rationale that underpins the
sampling approach.
Finally, while epistemological distinctions may occa-
sion different sampling strategies, this distinction may
not be quite so apparent in searching practice. The need
to search extensively and to follow up any potentially
useful lines of inquiry, while not driven by statistical
considerations, may be no less present when seeking to
find qualitative studies [32].
Sources
For inclusion in this section, a publication was required
to either (i) provide an overview of sources to be used in
the context of QES or (ii) include a substantive discus-
sion of the topic of selection of sources within a pub-
lished synthesis or (iii) mention the selection of sources
within any of the works identified for the “Overviews,
summaries and guidance” section. A total of 22 items
was thus included in this section [6, 8, 14, 18, 22, 34, 37,
39, 45, 46, 63, 83–85, 87–94].
Coverage of databases
In a sample of QES published in 2012–2013, Wright et
al. [94] reports the number of databases searched per re-
view ranged from 3 to 20, with 37 % searching from 3–5
databases, 28 % searching from 6–8 databases, 14 %
searching 9–11 databases and another 14 % searching 12
to 14 databases. Seven per cent of reviews searched over
16 databases. Reliance on MEDLINE alone is particularly
discouraged [83]. However, a meta-ethnographic study
in complementary and alternative medicine searched 67
different database sources and yet found 87 % of in-
cluded qualitative studies from PubMed alone [90].
CINAHL and DIMDI (a German database) also yielded
a high number of relevant hits.
Several authors point to the superiority of CINAHL’s
coverage of qualitative research [6, 8, 14]. The Cochrane
Handbook [6] and CRD [8] highlight that CINAHL
introduced “qualitative studies” in 1988, reflecting a par-
ticular interest in qualitative studies for nursing re-
searchers while MEDLINE did not add a corresponding
subject heading until 15 years later. However, technical
efficiency should not be confused with coverage with
CINAHL at 4.5 million records covering approximately
a quarter of the records included by MEDLINE. In their
recent study of multiple QES, Wright et al. [94] demon-
strate that, assuming a rigorous search strategy and ac-
curate indexing, CINAHL is a good source of primary
studies with the potential to yield unique studies.
Surveys consistently report MEDLINE and CINAHL
as the two most frequently searched sources of qualita-
tive research [39, 84]. CRD guidelines [8] stipulate that
“assuming that the topic of interest falls within their
scope, then searching both MEDLINE and CINAHL is
likely to be important.” CINAHL and MEDLINE re-
trieved references most relevant to a search on nursing
manpower and EMBASE did not provide substantive
additional information [22]. They recommend that both
CINAHL and MEDLINE be consulted when planning an
optimal bibliographical search related to nursing topics
as differences in coverage were striking.
While publication bias possesses a lower profile within
qualitative than quantitative research, review authors
must be aware that limiting a search to well-known da-
tabases may result in missing useful information. In par-
ticular, review teams should identify specialist databases
that relate to a particular topic and databases that
contain particular types of publication, e.g. Dissertation
Abstracts and supplementary search strategies that may
increase the chance of finding grey literature or of re-
trieving journals not indexed by the mainstream data-
bases [34]. McGinn et al. [91] report the performance of
databases across a small set of social care topics;
CINAHL performed at a consistently moderate level of
sensitivity across topics, and Social Care Online per-
formed consistently poorly. Social Services Abstracts
(SSA) was the best performing database [91] although
this again is likely to be topic specific [125] with certain
databases being indicated for certain kinds of questions
[87]. Some databases favour organisational-type ques-
tions while others privilege more clinical-type questions.
McGinn and colleagues [91] observe an “unpredictabil-
ity” around database performance across topics. This
occasions researchers to use conservative risk-averse
strategies such as consulting greater numbers of data-
bases and screening larger numbers of hits. As in the
relatively well-developed area of health care, there is an
ongoing need for database comparison case studies
across a wider variety of subtopics, thereby building up a
body of evidence on retrieval for qualitative research.
National bodies commissioning reviews typically seek
strong representation of indigenous studies within the
evidence base for a particular review question. Stansfield
et al. [92] demonstrated that a UK-fortified set of seven
additional databases (British Education Index, Child
data, IBSS, Index of British Theses, Social Care Online,
The British Library Integrated Catalogue and Zetoc)
yielded additional unique studies. Importantly, they did
not only limit themselves to examining retrieval rates
but also attempted to assess the impact on findings from
the final review. Of five studies identified through UK-
fortified strategies, one study was central to development
of a descriptive theme while the other four less influential
studies added detail and strength to the review’s findings.
Furthermore, these studies were of generally high quality,
contrasting with the methodological “futility” encountered
Booth Systematic Reviews  (2016) 5:74 
Page 9 of 23
 in a corresponding investigation of effectiveness studies
[126]. This represents an important future direction for
evaluation of search sources, strategies and procedures.
Grey literature sources
Grey (or “fugitive”) literature (e.g. technical reports, work-
ing papers) is frequently cited as an important source.
Commonly, reviewers pay homage to the potential value
of searching grey literature and then reject its feasibility,
citing limitations of time and costs [22, 37, 91]. In actual-
ity, we know little about the impact of publication bias
specifically on qualitative research. We understand that
researchers will often want to avoid opening up the pro-
spect
of
time-consuming
and
minimally
productive
follow-up of the unpublished literature. Nevertheless, it is
unhelpful for reviewers to imply through terse reporting
that they have “taken care of” this uncontrollable mass of
alternative publications. McGinn et al. [91] describe how
they pragmatically accepted grey literature, identified
serendipitously, when an item satisfied search selection
criteria but not specifically searching for it. This may open
up a review team to charges of being “unsystematic.” We
consider it unhelpful either to plan to search the “grey lit-
erature” or to claim to have done so—it is preferable to
pre-specify exactly what forms of literature are being
sought and then to select sources and strategies for these
specific forms, e.g. theses, process evaluations, hospital in-
ternal reports, research reports, conference proceedings,
studies produced by charities. Some authors have com-
piled lists of grey literature sources specific to health care
[85] and social care [87, 127].
Books and book chapters
Several commentators highlight that qualitative research
is published in books as well as journal articles. Strat-
egies for searching books and book chapters require par-
ticular consideration [34, 37, 45, 63]. Some differences
relate to the social science disciplinary background being
substantively different from the literature of medicine
[18, 37]. Campbell et al. describe inclusion of books and
book chapters in their two meta-ethnography case stud-
ies [37]. They identify the limitation of “truncation bias”
in connection with journal articles as the full details of a
descriptive qualitative study are unlikely to be published
in a short article. Campbell et al. therefore recommend
using multiple databases and search strategies in order
to maximise the yield of relevant qualitative papers [37].
Searching for books may be achieved through relevant
organisational websites, book catalogues, Google Scholar
and consultation with librarians [88, 89]. The determin-
ing factor is likely to be the resources available to an
individual project [37].
Theses
Further potentially useful sources, particularly given that
a qualitative research project is typically feasible within
the constraints of an academic qualification, are disserta-
tions and theses [46]. Some authors exhibit a similar re-
sistance to including theses as they do for grey literature
in general. Stated reasons for this range from practical
considerations, to keep the number of papers manage-
able [37, 46] and to prioritise the literature that is easier
and quicker to access [37], through to concerns about
items not being peer reviewed and published reports
[46]. Searching for theses is challenging as they are not
indexed in the same way as journal articles and may be
accessible only from experts (researchers, providers, pol-
icy makers) or via specialist theses databases [37, 93].
Access to relevant studies may be achieved by searching
relevant organisational websites, Google Scholar, thesis
databases, specialist journals and consultation with li-
brarians [88, 89]. It may be feasible to include only re-
cent theses as they are less likely to possess published
journal counterparts [37]. A unique methodological
issue is the depth of reporting possible in a PhD thesis.
If one or two theses are included alongside a larger
number of published articles, constrained by word
limits, they may “swamp” the data from these naturally
thinner studies. It is preferable, where possible, to iden-
tify published journal articles derived from theses,
thereby making the units of analysis more readily com-
parable. Nevertheless, the volume of data from more
extensively reported theses is not an argument against
their inclusion per se, simply against the uncritical use
of theses, making procedures of quality assessment cor-
respondingly more critical.
Structured questions
To be included in this section, a publication should (i)
provide an overview of structuring of review questions
within the context of QES or (ii) include a substantive
discussion of structuring review questions within a pub-
lished synthesis or (iii) any relevant mention in works
identified for the “Overviews, summaries and guidance”
section. A total of 17 items was included in this section
[9, 10, 13, 15, 28, 30, 31, 34, 41, 65, 73, 95–98, 101, 102].
The literature on qualitative searching tends to reflect
four approaches to use of a structured, formulated review
question. A minority of commentators assume that the re-
quirement to formulate the question as a Population-
Intervention-Comparison-Outcome
(PICO)
is
shared
across quantitative and qualitative review types [101]. The
PICO format is underpinned by assumptions derived from
epidemiological study design seen in the terminology
used. A large majority of variants propose modifications
that reinterpret the PICO approach, e.g. 3WH [28], PEI-
CO(S), PICo, PICOC, PICOS, SPICE, SPIDER [98].
Booth Systematic Reviews  (2016) 5:74 
Page 10 of 23
 Several commentators suggest specific question formula-
tions for specific purposes, e.g. CIMO [96], ECLIPSe [95]
BeHEMoTh [9]. Noticeable among these second and third
approaches are the typical addition of elements capturing
context (aka environment or setting, e.g. BeHEMoTh,
CIMO, PEICO(S), PICo, PICOC, SPICE) and the stance of
the affected party (e.g., perspective in SPICE and stake-
holders in PEICO(S)) (Table 4).
A significant few question the appropriateness of a pre-
specified (i.e. a priori) question at all. Drawing upon the
primary qualitative heritage of grounded theory, they
assert that the review question only emerges from a pre-
liminary analysis of the data. Related to this issue are two
other considerations; first, whether iterative approaches
are appropriate to searching for qualitative research and
second, when a QES accompanies an SR of trials, whether
the scope of the review questions should be coterminous.
As with quantitative reviews, there is little empirical data
to support the merits of question formulation [13, 101].
With regard to the choice of specific frameworks, limited
evidence suggests that PICO may be preferred when the
primary objective is sensitivity whereas SPIDER favours
specificity [101]. The authors recommend a modified PICO
with added qualitative search terms (PICOS) which opti-
mises the trade-off between sensitivity (not missing rele-
vant items) and specificity (only retrieving relevant items)
for circumstances when a fully comprehensive search is
not feasible.
Differences between quantitative and qualitative review
questions
Lorenc et al. [41] describe circumstances where the
qualitative review question may not directly mirror the
PICO of an SR of trials. In their review of preventive
interventions for skin cancer, they identified useful non-
interventional studies that were about attitudes to sun
behaviours or skin cancer in general [41]. They reinter-
preted their inclusion criteria to include any study
reporting qualitative evidence relating to sun protection
beliefs or behaviours, regardless of a link to a specific
intervention. They conclude that this finding might
translate to public health, and social and health research
more generally, where relatively little qualitative evi-
dence on specific interventions is available. Data linked
to specific interventions were not necessarily of greater
value than data related to broader attitudes.
Where QES are conducted in parallel with SRs of trials,
review teams may have to adopt different conceptual sche-
mata for their inclusion criteria and search strategies [41].
In contrast to current guidance, that seeks a common
question structure (e.g. PICO) for the SR of trials and the
QES, the authors flag that “structural divergence” between
the two questions may be inevitable [41].
O’Connell and Downe [73] attempt to reconcile the
tension between the need to preserve flexibility and yet
“maximise rigour” through an explicit two-stage process.
This process involved iteration in regard to topic defin-
ition followed by tight control over inclusion and exclu-
sion,
study
quality
and
analysis.
Scoping
a
topic,
primarily performed for logistic considerations in an SR
of trials, becomes correspondingly more important if the
review team is to ensure “secure” concepts within the
context of a QES. Divergence between commentators on
the need for a pre-specified formulated question is partly
explained by whether they consider the scoping process
to be preliminary to, or integral to, the review process.
So Ring et al. [34] state that QES typically start with a
relatively well-defined research question and yet ac-
knowledge, with Dixon-Woods et al. [30] that, according
to their philosophical approach, some QES reviewers
modify their initial research question in response to
literature searching and screening [34].
Some commentators make a useful distinction between
summative or aggregative QES, where research questions
are generally established a priori and relevant research re-
ports are identified exhaustively, and knowledge-building
or theory-generating QES where such pre-specification
may inhibit creativity [15]. The latter, they argue, starts
from a less-clearly defined focus and evolve iteratively
[10]. Within such a context, the expansive, as opposed to
exhaustive, literature search can be viewed as a creative
vehicle for continually redefining the research question
and
exploring
the
emergence
of
research
findings.

 Consequently, Dixon-Woods and colleagues [65] evoke
earlier qualitative researchers in suggesting that this
process, with the review question being highly iterative
and modified in response to search results, treats the
question as a compass rather than an anchor.
Search procedures
Publications in this section should either (i) provide an
overview of topic-based database search procedures
within the context of QES or (ii) include a substantive
discussion of topic-based database search procedures
within a published synthesis or (iii) mention database
search procedures within works identified for the “Over-
views, summaries and guidance” section. Six items were
thus included in this section [15, 21, 34, 35, 37, 103].
A literature searcher faces a dual challenge in how best
to optimise the trade-off between recall and precision,
thereby keeping the expenditure of resources within
manageable limits [37]. Several variables determine ap-
propriate search procedures. These include how diffuse
or broad the topic for review or synthesis is which re-
quires a wider net and inclusion of more databases [37].
Exhaustive searches often necessitate “trawling” to identify
every possible study. They often prove time-consuming
and result in large numbers of non-relevant studies [34].
Strategies that attempt to maximise the number of poten-
tially relevant records (high sensitivity) often result in a
large number of non-relevant studies (low specificity) [21].
A review team should seek to optimise the ratio between
the number of relevant references and the number of re-
trieved references (the “hit rate”) for sensitive topic-based
searches and reflect whether available time might be
better spent conducting citation searches on the Web of
Science or Google Scholar (see the “Supplementary strat-
egies” section). Finfgeld-Connett and Johnson [15] distin-
guish between extensive search approaches (that map to
exhaustive searches) and expansive approaches (which
progressively explore emerging lines of inquiry).
Mackay [103] differentiates between “qualitative” and
“quantitative” searching approaches highlighting a similar-
ity to the difference between qualitative and quantitative
research methods. A quantitative searching approach is
linear and structured based on objective and reproducible
identification of pre-specified literature. Qualitative search
approaches are concerned with the essential and peculiar
character of phenomena and recognise that searching is
never value free. Qualitative searching strategies are slow,
labour intensive and difficult to replicate (because of the
amount of time needed). They may be used when a topic
is not dominant in the discourse of the literature and/or
the topic is not well-conceptualised in the literature. The
comprehensive a priori quantitative search contrasts with
the intuitive and recursive follow-up of the purposive, it-
erative qualitative search. Both strategies can be systematic
or not depending on how disciplined the searcher is.
Documentation of the a priori (protocol-driven) search
strategy (e.g. using screen captures) ensures that the
search is explicit and thorough. For the iterative searching
approach, a process analogous to memoing may be used
to record the working notes of the searcher. Thus, both
qualitative (iterative) and quantitative (a priori) search ap-
proaches can be systematic if the searcher is explicit about
their searching processes.
Even though all synthesis methods include iteration,
the degree, and the review stage at which iteration takes
place, varies. Framework synthesis and critical interpret-
ive synthesis explicitly involve iterative literature search-
ing while realist synthesis and meta-narrative involve
iteration at every stage [35]. Several synthesis methods
do not explicitly mention iterative searching and thus
implicitly subject themselves to a priori and positivist
assumptions [35]. Meta-aggregation follows closely the
single pass a priori-formulated search strategy model, the
“big bang approach” which relies upon pre-identification
of searching strategies, inclusion/exclusion criteria etcet-
era and implementing these with fidelity [35]. Increasing
awareness of the array of sampling methods available and
appropriate for synthesis coupled with the pragmatic
demands of conducting reviews in public health or
social work practice is likely to result in wider uptake
of iterative searching. However, iterative searching poses
significant challenges to the reporting of search strategies
and may well subvert the discipline imposed by the
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flow diagram [128].
The process of development of a search strategy for a
QES is not demonstrably different from that for an SR
of trials [34]. In both cases, searches need to be devel-
oped for the topic area and, separately, for the types of
studies to be included [34]. The searcher must judge the
optimal balance between sensitivity (not missing relevant
items) and specificity (only retrieving relevant items) for
both the topic and the study type. A very specific inter-
pretation of qualitative research might involve only
searching for words relating to ethnographies. A sensi-
tive interpretation might involve specifying the types of
phenomenon (e.g. views, attitudes, feelings), the study
types (e.g. phenomenology), the data collection methods
(e.g. interviews, questionnaires and focus groups) and
the types of data (stories, narratives, etcetera).
A related issue concerns the type of data source to be
included within the QES. The Cochrane Qualitative and
Implementation Methods Group concurs with other
review teams (e.g. [10, 28, 37]) by operationalising
“qualitative research” as research using a recognised
method of qualitative data collection and a recognised
method of qualitative data analysis. More forgiving inter-
pretations might include data from open-ended responses
Booth Systematic Reviews  (2016) 5:74 
Page 12 of 23
 to questions in an otherwise quantitative questionnaire or
survey. A narrow set of studies might be retrieved by only
synthesising qualitative data reported in or alongside ran-
domised controlled trials (e.g. from pilot studies, feasibility
studies, process evaluations). We coined the concept “sib-
ling studies” to characterise studies that derive from the
same parent study but that report a particular slice of the
data [7, 110]. Glenton et al. [104] explored the use of dir-
ectly related (sibling) qualitative studies in connection
with a Cochrane review of lay health workers. Only a
small proportion of included trials had carried out some
form of qualitative data collection during or after the
intervention. Data were “sparse” with methods and results
being poorly described. Their findings echo an earlier
study by members of the same team [105] that found only
30 of 100 trials had associated qualitative work. Further-
more, around half of these sibling studies pre-dated publi-
cation of the trial [104].
Reviewers may also decide either to include or exclude
mixed-methods studies and may choose either to syn-
thesise such studies in their entirety or to focus only on
the qualitative component of the larger study [8]. How-
ever, CRD guidance cautions against relying on strategies
designed to retrieve clinical trials as a route to identify-
ing qualitative associated or linked counterparts, citing
the Cochrane Handbook requirement for structured
searching [129].
The scope of an SR of clinical trials may differ from
that for an accompanying QES [41]. Qualitative re-
searchers may not have conducted research around a
particular intervention, particularly where it is novel or
experimental. A review team may need to access re-
search about the patient’s experience of their condition,
barriers and facilitators for existing treatments, and the
characteristics of an “ideal” intervention to address re-
view questions relating to feasibility and acceptability.
Furthermore, few primary studies are likely to share the
same research question or focus as the planned synthe-
sis. However, this does not mean that these studies may
not yield relevant data [34]. “Dropping” the interven-
tion concept makes the search strategy broader for the
qualitative component than for its quantitative counter-
part. Alternatively, for interventions where context is
important (e.g. cultural attitudes or health service spe-
cific effects), a qualitative synthesis may implement a
narrower interpretation of scope, such as countries with
a comparable health system (to facilitate transferability)
compared with the SR of clinical trials (which aspires
to generalisability). The Cochrane Handbook [6] cau-
tions that seeking to retrieve qualitative studies from a
topic-based search strategy designed to identify trials is
methodologically unsound. A trial-based search strategy
is not designed to identify qualitative studies. Indeed,
the trial-based strategy may well achieve a measure of
specificity by purposefully excluding many qualitative
research types.
Where the scope of quantitative and qualitative re-
views is co-terminous a review team can employ a broad
approach using subject and topic terms without specify-
ing the study type(s) of interest [8]. Both quantitative
and qualitative studies would be identified. However, this
method generates large numbers of retrieved records
and requires those sifting the abstracts to be equally
adept at identifying both types of study. Such an approach
is employed at the EPPI-Centre where they routinely
conduct reviews of “views studies” alongside reviews of
effectiveness [130].
In reviewing the quality of reported search procedures
in a sample of published qualitative syntheses, Dixon-
Woods et al. observe that search techniques often lack
sophistication and are thus likely to miss relevant mater-
ial [88]. They suggest a need to involve an information
specialist in the search process, already well-recognised
for quantitative systematic reviews.
Search strategies and filters
For inclusion in this section, a publication was required to
either (i) provide an overview of search strategies and/or
methodological filters within the context of QES or (ii) in-
clude a substantive discussion of search strategies and/or
methodological filters within a published QES or (iii) any
mention of search strategies and/or methodological filters
within works identified for the “Overviews, summaries
and guidance” section. Sixteen items were included in this
section [8, 16, 17, 19–25, 34, 37, 44, 77, 88, 90].
The development of pre-specified search strategies
using methodological terms has an extensive pedigree
within quantitative research, particularly for randomised
controlled trials. Methodological “filters” or “hedges” are
specially designed search strategies used to retrieve
citations of clinically relevant and scientifically sound
studies (or reviews) [131]. These search terms are ini-
tially suggested by librarians and clinical users, and
then, performance metrics are generated for these
terms both singly and in combination. The performance
of hedges for clinical trials was subsequently enhanced by
a Cochrane-associated retrospective indexing initiative.
Almost a decade later, the Hedges Project at McMaster
University expanded its battery of empirically tested meth-
odological filters to include qualitative research filters for
the four principal health-related databases, namely MED-
LINE [25], CINAHL [24], PsycINFO [19] and EMBASE
[23]. A range of filters (sensitive—to minimise the poten-
tial of missing relevant references, specific—to minimise
the potential of including irrelevant references and opti-
mal—to determine an efficient trade-off between sensitiv-
ity and specificity) is available for each database (Table 5),
supported by information about how the filters were

 developed to help in selecting an appropriate filter
(http://hiru.mcmaster.ca/hiru/HIRU_Hedges_home.aspx).
A survey of members of the Cochrane Qualitative Methods
Network revealed some resistance to the use of filters with
associated concerns about whether filters were suitably
comprehensive
[17].
Notwithstanding
these
concerns,
qualitative filters demonstrate a performance that com-
pares favourably with that for retrieval of trials. More re-
cently, the InterTASC Information Specialists’ Sub-Group
(ISSG) of information professionals has produced a Search
Filter Resource (www.york.ac.uk/inst/crd/intertasc/) docu-
menting the evidence base for published filters.
The performance of filters is liable to change over time
[22, 125], with new terms being added by the user com-
munity, changes to indexing terminology and journal
coverage and the appearance of specialist qualitative
journals. The utility of the MEDLINE empirically tested
filter [25] was compromised, albeit to a minor degree, by
the appearance of the MeSH term “qualitative research”
in 2002, subsequent to creating the test and validation
sets. Differences exist in the indexing of qualitative re-
search within electronic databases such as MEDLINE,
EMBASE, PsycINFO and CINAHL [77, 88]. Reviewers
should avoid running a filter devised on one database
against another database or, less obviously, translating
terms on a one-by-one basis from one database to
another. In the context of research syntheses, more
generally, Cooper [132] encourages searching multiple
databases simultaneously where possible, to avoid exces-
sive duplication. However, a simultaneous searching of
multiple databases requires that the searcher develop a
strategy that is not overly reliant on specific indexing
terms, particularly as they might be artificially inverted
(e.g. education, professional) and thus retrieve zero hits
on databases other than their parent source.
Optimally, a sensitive strategy retrieves individual
terms regardless of how they occur within indexing lan-
guages although in the example of “Professional AND
Education” the numbers of retrieved results and the high
proportion of “false hits” would prove prohibitive. It may
be useful to undertake a content analysis of the subject
headings assigned in each database to determine why
indexing terms diverge across databases [22]. The more
varied the databases, the more challenging creation of a
“standard” search filter for application to all databases
becomes, suggesting that search strings need to be
“adapted to the idiosyncrasies of each synthesis to
achieve the best results” [37]. Generally, methodological
filters for qualitative research have undergone little
replication and validation [16, 34, 88]. It is not known
whether search filters, as developed for health care
[20, 23–25], are equally feasible and useful within dis-
ciplines such as social work or education.
In the context of filters in general, Jenkins [106] at-
tempts to identify different generations of search filters
with corresponding degrees of rigour. Foremost among

Page 14 of 23
 these are filters developed from a single “gold standard”
set of unequivocally relevant references (i.e. identifiable
qualitative research studies) and then randomly splitting
these records into a development and validation set. Un-
fortunately, few available filters or hedges for qualitative
research meet this empirical standard.
A search strategy to be effective requires (i) that it re-
trieves relevant records, (ii) that it does not retrieve ir-
relevant references and (iii) that the collective terms be
parsimonious, thereby avoiding redundancy. The third
requirement is a particular current concern for the
qualitative searching community. Lengthy filters have
been devised, collecting together research methodology
terms or all possible terms to capture “patient views.”
However, once a particular record is retrieved by one
term, there is little value in retrieving it again using sub-
sequent terms. A reviewer is primarily interested in re-
trieving additional different records or in retrieving a
record on a subsequent database if it has been missed
because of the indexing particularities of a previously
searched database [77]. Two case studies [16, 44] suggest
that a parsimonious strategy involving the terms qualita-
tive, findings and interview* (as both text word and index
term) may perform acceptably well when conducting a
search for qualitative research across a range of databases.
Such a broad free-text strategy performed particularly well
on the CINAHL database [8]. It is critical that this finding
is tested across multiple topics and time spans.
Searching with “broad terms” such as “qualitative re-
search,” “qualitative studies” and “interview,” together with
their topic terms, may be equally applicable for all data-
bases [90]. In contrast, specific MeSH terms or methodo-
logical index terms that aid the identification of qualitative
research (“exploratory,” “grounded theory,” “content ana-
lysis,” “focus groups” and “ethnography”) provided no
additional results and delivered numerous false hits. An
evaluation by Shaw et al. [21] confirms that an optimal
strategy for retrieving qualitative research will combine
specific free-text terms, broad terms and thesaurus terms;
relying on one strategy alone would fail to identify rele-
vant records. This evaluation identified low precision for
all three types of strategy, with only 4 % of papers proving
to be relevant at full-text screening. Campbell et al. [37]
describe using the single term “qualitative” for title
searches of the ZETOC contents database. Anecdotally,
searches of Google Scholar enjoyed some success by
adapting the MEDLINE-based “qualitative OR findings
OR interview*” strategy, either combined with subject
terms or within the “Search within Cited Articles” feature
for already-identified relevant citations.
Supplementary strategies
To be included, a publication was required to either (i)
provide an overview of supplementary (i.e. non-topic-
based) search strategies within the context of QES or (ii)
include a substantive discussion of supplementary (i.e.
non-topic-based) search strategies within a published QES
or (iii) include any mention of supplementary search strat-
egies within works identified for the “Overviews, summar-
ies and guidance” section. A total of 24 items was thus
included in this section [8, 10, 14, 20, 30, 34, 37, 39, 42,
45, 62, 63, 84, 94, 107–116].
Guidance on meta-ethnography advocates that, in
order to minimise the risk of missing studies, searchers
conduct supplementary searches alongside topic-based
database searching [37]. The authors propose a multi-
pronged approach; hand-searching relevant journals;
contacting experts in the field of enquiry for curricula vi-
tae and information; and examination of the “grey litera-
ture,” conference proceedings etcetera [37]. They rightly
advise that decisions should be made at each stage
depending on the resources available. Search strategies
for qualitative research should extend beyond electronic
databases [20, 30, 63] but knowledge about which strat-
egies to use for particular topics is not forthcoming
[109]. Several commentators report that supplementary
search strategies are useful in compensating for deficien-
cies of indexing terms and the limited value of “proto-
col-driven search strategies” [8, 10, 14, 62]. Key journals
are hand-searched in case electronic searches are not
sufficiently sensitive or where indexers have not assigned
adequate keywords [37].
Noticeable is a trend to favour creative approaches to
retrieval—most notably Bates’ berry picking approach
[107]. Barroso et al. [10] used berry picking as a frame-
work for their search techniques for a meta-synthesis
project on women with HIV infection. Combining for-
mal search strategy methods with berry picking may
help to expand searching from a broad topic towards
“new, unpredictable ideas and directions” and even re-
formulation of the original query [108]. More recently,
berry picking has been revisited, as an alternative to
extensive keyword-based approaches [15, 40].
Booth et al. [110] have designed a search approach
that seeks to place Bates’ berry picking [107] on a
more systematic footing. The CLUSTER approach
seeks to maximise identification of associated or linked
studies, identifying not only studies that are instru-
mentally linked as “sibling studies” but also studies
that are theoretically or conceptually associated, “kin-
ship studies” [110]. From a single “key pearl citation,”
the authors conduct searches to find contextually or
theoretically proximate documents. They follow up

mnemonic) [110].
Booth Systematic Reviews  (2016) 5:74 
Page 15 of 23
 Increasingly, reviews of complex interventions require
that a review team identifies the conceptual underpin-
nings and explores the contextual detail. The CLUSTER
method aims to retrieve both concepts and contexts
[110]. While not all commentators acknowledge that
theory can be retrieved in a systematic way, Booth and
Carroll [9] have recently devised a structured procedure,
BeHEMoTh, of steps to retrieve papers reporting theory.
Dixon-Woods et al. [84] reported that the most com-
mon supplementary strategies used alongside biblio-
graphic databases were following up reference lists and
hand searching. Subsequently, Hannes et al. [39] found
that reference or citation searching was used in more
than half the QES in their sample. Other popular search
strategies included hand-searching journals, contacting
experts or authors or web searching. Reviewers also men-
tioned personal correspondence, related paper options in
existing databases, email discussion lists, footnote chasing,
or searching conference abstracts, etc. Other approaches
include scanning conference proceedings, contacting pro-
fessional bodies, searching for grey literature and looking
at included studies of earlier reviews, personal corres-
pondence, related paper options in existing databases,
email discussion lists, footnote chasing or searching
conference abstracts [39, 42].
Greenhalgh and Peacock, frequently cited in support
of deficiencies of topic-based search strategies, report an
audit of sources for a review of complex interventions,
of which a proportion relates to qualitative evidence
[62]. Only 30 % of included studies were identified from
databases and hand searches. About half of studies were
identified by “snowballing” (e.g. reference, footnote and
citation tracking) and another 24 % by personal know-
ledge or personal contact. However, the team had
recognised a priori that their topic area was diffuse and
ill-suited to keyword-based strategies (in essence be-
coming self-fulfilling) and report relative percentages
where increased effort aimed at one source, e.g. per-
sonal contact, makes the remaining sources appear less
useful. A rigorous evaluation would study whether items
could have been identified using databases, regardless of
how they were actually identified. In another case study,
citation searching, reference checking and contact with
experts yielded 11 of 41 included studies [20]. The use of
citation pearl growing (i.e. using known relevant items to
identify supplementary search terms) was of limited value
because none of the 10 candidate databases, from which
the other 31 included studies were derived, included more
than four relevant items and therefore did not offer suffi-
cient data for analysis.
Reference checking
Gomersall et al. [115] report that using reference lists of
relevant literature identified 38 relevant articles. Critical,
however, is how many included studies were identified
uniquely from reference lists. Similarly, Steen et al. [116]
found that backchaining (i.e. checking of reference lists
from included studies) identified a further six studies of
potential relevance. However, their paper is unclear on
how many of these were uniquely identified and subse-
quently included in the review. Malpass et al. [114]
checked reference lists and contacted authors unearthing
one relevant paper which was of sufficient quality to be
included in the synthesis. Checking the context of a
citation within the paper, not just its appearance in a
reference list, is particularly helpful when titles are not
informative [34]. There is a compelling argument to sug-
gest that checking of references in the full-text of already
included, or indeed potentially includable retrieved stud-
ies, should not be regarded as a supplementary tech-
nique but rather simply as standard good practice.
Hand searching
Several reports rate hand searching of relevant journals
as “useful” [109]. However, such anecdotes usually lack
data on yields or time spent hand searching. Hand
searching is particularly indicated where relevant data is
“buried” within the text of a paper and the study is not
retrieved through electronic searches [34]. Typically,
hand searching is a misnomer as browsing of titles and
abstracts is facilitated online or, where available, a jour-
nal’s search facility offers full-text searching over and
above the title and abstract facility offered by most
bibliographic
databases.
Additional
time
should
be
allowed for supplementary activities [34]. In published
audits, Qualitative Health Research [84] and Journal of
Advanced Nursing [39] were the most common outlets
for QES. For meta-ethnographies, France et al. [42] re-
ported that the majority (41 %) were published in nursing
or midwifery journals, a higher proportion than identified
in an earlier audit (32 %) [39]. Such data may however be
confounded by the reported superiority of CINAHL when
indexing qualitative publications.
Citation checking
Citation checking harnesses the degree of “relatedness”
between an original source and its citing paper. How-
ever, “related” items may share a topic, methodology or
some tangential or obscure connection. Citation check-
ing (forward chaining) may variously and unpredictably
perform better or worse when compared to a keyword-
based subject search. Atkins et al. [45] found citation
searching of limited use locating only three of 44 in-
cluded studies through this method and consulting with
experts combined. Even though some review teams re-
port limited success from citation checking, they may
differ in their thoroughness or the extent that they use
Booth Systematic Reviews  (2016) 5:74 
Page 16 of 23
 complementary search strategies and so citation check-
ing should not be ruled out.
Contact with authors/experts
The use of experts as a source of potentially relevant
citations has received mixed verdicts, from being vital
[62, 63] through to simply useful [111–114]. Campbell
et al. [37] describe the “striking” importance of consult-
ation with experts, alongside hand searching. As men-
tioned above, Atkins et al. [45] found consulting with
experts of limited use. Again, the performance of supple-
mentary strategies is relative and depends upon what they
are compared with. Greenhalgh and Peacock [62] reported
that contacts with experts yielded significant suggestions
of potentially relevant reports when reviewing service-
level innovations in health care organisations. Pearson et
al. reported that contacting authors of included reports
was not an effective use of time or resources. Contact with
authors yielded 13 potential leads of which only one poor-
quality report was included [109]. In part, these differ-
ences may be topic-specific, but they may equally reflect
how good a review team’s networks are and thus represent
a source of potential bias [109].
Other methods
Pearson et al. [109] identify a further targeted search
strategy using programme names for particular initia-
tives. This supplementary technique is one component
of the CLUSTER methodology [110]. Pearson et al. [109]
conclude that it is unclear from published reports why
certain topics or supplementary approaches yield more
positive results than others. Rather than endorsing one
approach over another, this evidence illustrates the chal-
lenges of searching across topics that are poorly defined
by database keywords. Retrospective analyses of different
search approaches require more detailed reporting than
presently available [94]. For the moment, a review team
must judge how they should allocate their overall search
resource between topic-based searching and other ap-
proaches for their specific topic. However, a multiple search
strategy is more likely to identify relevant qualitative re-
search than one relying solely on electronic searching [37].
Standards
For inclusion, a publication should either (i) provide a
standard for reporting literature searches within the con-
text of QES or (ii) include standards for reporting of litera-
ture searching within a wider reporting standard or (iii)
any mention of reporting or documentation of search
strategies for QES within works identified for the “Over-
views, summaries and guidance” section. Seventeen items
were included in this section [6, 8, 12, 14, 15, 21, 39, 42,
45, 46, 54, 70, 84, 88, 89, 101, 117].
There remains a high degree of consensus that QES
should be systematic, explicit and reproducible [8, 54, 89].
Weed [70], creator of meta-interpretation, observes that
the audit trail serves not to enable “member checking”
but to make the search transparent and “demonstrate
the ‘reasonableness’ of the analysis.” Weed [70] subse-
quently suggests a level of detail in QES reports that
should include the extent of theoretical sampling and
how and why and on what basis studies have been
chosen for inclusion in each iteration. He further advo-
cates that complete reporting should include processes
by which studies are subsequently excluded, reasons for
their exclusion; an interim analysis at the end of each
iteration and processes by which concepts for further
theoretical sampling has been identified.
Audits of reports of published qualitative evidence
syntheses reveal disappointingly low standards of report-
ing of search processes [12, 39, 84]. Typically, neither
the search strategy nor the databases searched are de-
tailed in the published report [84]. Similar limitations in
reporting of search strategies were observed in a recent
survey of meta-ethnographies [42]. Both CRD [8] and
Cochrane [6] champion the importance of reporting
standards for search methods, including documenting
the methods for sampling. They highlight proposed
Standards for Reporting Literature searches (STARLITE)
as a useful resource [12].
Reporting of systematic reviews is prescribed by the
PRISMA, formerly QUOROM, statement. In an attempt
to mirror this approach within QES, an international
collaboration has produced a tentative reporting stand-
ard. The ENhancing Transparency in REporting the syn-
thesis of Qualitative research (ENTREQ) draft statement
[88] recommends the use of the PRISMA flowchart
[128] for reporting, searching, screening and identifying
studies for inclusion in the QES. ENTREQ is influenced
by STARLITE [12] in recognising the need to specify the
sampling strategy (item 3)—a feature not typically in-
cluded when searches are comprehensive by default.
Table 6 presents the four items from ENTREQ that
specifically relate to literature searching and maps these
to the elements of the STARLITE mnemonic. However,
uptake of ENTREQ [88] is low. A recent review of meta-
ethnography reporting [42] observed that only one of 19
papers published since ENTREQ’s publication had used
the proposed standard to guide its reporting.
Several authors have identified a corresponding need
to improve the quality of reporting of primary qualitative
research, many focusing on the utility of structured ab-
stracts [45]. Although this review emphasises potential
differences with searching for an SR of clinical trials,
both types of review benefit from attempts to improve
reporting of search methods. Thus, Kable et al. [117]
provide a 12-step general strategy for documenting the
Booth Systematic Reviews  (2016) 5:74 
Page 17 of 23
 search process for a literature review, heavily informed
by qualitative work [12, 14, 21, 101]. Niederstadt and
Droste [133] specify requirements for reporting and pre-
senting information retrieval processes for health tech-
nology assessment, and these too inform presentation of
search results for a QES.
Finally, we remark upon a paradox, now recognised in
the QES community, that iterative approaches using
innovative, yet appropriate, sampling techniques may
reflect more informed sophisticated and topic-specific
approaches to searching and yet be correspondingly
more difficult to report. Reviewers face a choice between
a simple, yet easily reported, strategy and a complex,
“messy” but accurate, strategy that is more difficult to
describe and present. Reviewers should make literature
search processes as transparent as possible, even when
complex [15]. However, little practical guidance exists
on how to achieve such transparency. France et al. [42]
speculate that one reason why comprehensive searches
persist may be attributed to the dominance of estab-
lished methods and guidance for conducting and report-
ing quantitative reviews of trials [8, 128, 129]. Toye and
colleagues [46] reflect on how the shaping influence of
the Cochrane Collaboration impacted on their decisions
to conduct and report their QES and thus satisfy exter-
nal expectations for rigour.
Discussion
While there appears to be considerable consensus in
relation to the methodology of searching for qualitative
research, the findings from this methodological overview
should be treated with caution. A limited number of au-
thors and teams are particularly influential within this
narrow, specialist area of information retrieval. Further-
more, much accepted opinion can be attributed to the
fact that different commentators are drawing upon and
citing the same limited set of references in support of
their opinions. The methodological guidance is particu-
larly derivative from a few key influential works. Further-
more, retrospective analyses limit the extent to which
investigators can take account of search strategy design,
database interface and accuracy of database indexing
[94]. Future analyses should collect data on search strat-
egy design, database interface and indexing prospectively
to allow review teams to consider the impact of these
factors on overall search performance. Finally, the review
reveals a paucity of empirical data. Much guidance is
based on personal or organisational experience, limited
case studies or overworked, and occasionally misapplied,
empirical studies, for example the implication that the
specific emphasis of search approaches appropriate to a
meta-narrative on diffusion of innovations is generically
transferable to all QES topics [62]. Table 7 tentatively
suggests some starting principles, with reference to the
7S sections of this review, to inform guidance irrespect-
ive of the review producer. On a positive note, we can
detect increasing transparency in search methods. Hannes
et al. [3] compared published data from 2005 to 2008 [39]
with data from 1988 to 2004 [84]. Considerably, more
QES papers described the databases they had searched,
more reported supplementary search strategies and more
chose to specify their search terms.
Towards a research agenda
McGinn et al. [91] recommend that review teams part-
ner with librarians or information specialists to share
the outcomes of case studies that showcase thorough
searches and examine their yield. There is a particular
need to report data, either within reviews themselves or
in subsequent retrospective methodological studies, on
where included studies could have been found as well as
how they actually were found. The caveat is that re-
viewers report considerable differences in yields from
different sources for different topics (e.g. even for two
meta-ethnography case studies by the same team [37]).
Consequently, review teams cannot predict whether
topics are more likely to be similar or different, with
what has worked previously not being a guarantor of
subsequent success in a different topic [37]. Indeed, the
degree to which past performance is a predictor of
future performance is currently unknown [94].

 A review of the methodological guidance reveals a need
to balance development of generic guidance with develop-
ment of guidance specific to particular methods of synthe-
sis. The development of specific guidance, where methods
of sampling, searching and synthesis are all aligned, is a
potential route for reconciling the comprehensive versus
purposive sampling debate. Important developments for
QES reporting standards are the National Institute for
Health Research funded Realist And Meta-narrative Evi-
dence Syntheses: Evolving Standards (RAMESES) project
for meta-narrative [118] and realist reviews [119] and the
Meta-Ethnography Reporting Guideline (eMERGe) pro-
ject for meta-ethnographies [120].

This
review
possesses several limitations. For inclusion, references
must include terms specifically related to searching or
retrieval in their titles or abstracts, or cite a limited
number of key texts, or be referred to from previously
identified items. It is increasingly prohibitive to exam-
ine the full-text of all papers reporting QES. Individual
reviews may explore innovative methods of information
retrieval but not showcase their methodology. However,
it is unlikely that this review has completely overlooked
important issues given the extent of included articles,
studies and guidance. While patterns of co-citation or
theoretical saturation are largely unexplored within a
methodological context, the reviewer reached a point
where no additional items were being identified. Some
key items were purposely excluded because they did
Table 7 Some starting principles for qualitative searching
Component
Starting principles
Sampling
Where approaches other than comprehensive sampling are used, reviewers must justify their sampling
strategy, match it to their synthesis method and describe fully how it was implemented.
Sources
For health topics, MEDLINE and CINAHL are considered a minimum, augmented by topic-specific and
setting-specific sources. Reviewers should devise specific strategies to find specific types of grey literature,
where included.
Structured questions
In the absence of empirical data on effectiveness of structured approaches, the question structure should
be selected to match the purpose and focus on the review. When accompanying a review of clinical trials,
the two review questions may or may not be co-terminous.
Search procedures
Given the comparatively low yield of qualitative topic-based searches, reviewers should privilege specificity
(retrieval of relevant items). Retrieved relevant items can then be used as a starting point for developing
supplementary search techniques. Reviewers should compensate for reported deficiencies in indexing by
using a broad range of supplementary strategies.
Search strategies and filters
Filters should be commensurate with the intended purpose of the review. When extensive supplementary
strategies are being employed to offer improved sensitivity, the topic-based searches may use a simple filter
(using terms such as qualitative OR findings OR interview).
Supplementary strategies
Reference checking must be a default for every review. For diffuse topics, or those with significant variation
in terminology, hand searching, citation searching or contact with authors/experts may be relatively productive.
Where context or theory is particularly important, the CLUSTER method [110] may be appropriate. Trial identifiers
(ISRCTN or trial name) may be useful for sibling or kinship studies for trials.
Standards
In the absence of a consensual standard for reporting, ENTREQ [88], supplemented by PRISMA [128] and
STARLITE [12] where necessary, should be used when reporting a search.

ally based on or supported by one or more case studies. In-
deed, case studies were the most prevalent method used to
advance observations on search methodology, with the cor-
responding weakness that lessons from individual case
studies may not be transferable. The shortage of compara-
tive designs or validation studies is likely to be indicative of
a corresponding dearth of funded projects exploring meth-
odological aspects of searching for qualitative studies. Simi-
larly, outside the case study evidence base, wider insights
derive either from opportunistic samples or from analysing
convenience samples of published QES. Notwithstanding
the fact that many guidance documents exist in this
domain, these too are limited by the weak quality of the
evidence used to underpin published recommendations.
Conclusions
QES is an exciting and rapidly developing methodological
field, evidenced by a proliferation of methods and of pub-
lished examples. Decisions regarding search strategy and
screening hinge upon such considerations as the review
aims, resources, availability of studies and epistemological
viewpoint [46]. However, the popularity of QES should
not mask the poor empirical base that exists for many
decisions within the searching process. Methodological
overviews are largely populated by common empirical
studies which are frequently referenced as authoritative.
As with quantitative reviews, there is little empirical data
to support the merits of question formulation [101]. Yields
from particular databases appear to be largely review spe-
cific. Empirical research is required to examine sugges-
tions in the literature that thorough searching of a small
number of databases [16, 22, 90], supplemented by other
searching methods, may be more efficient than searching
across a wider range of databases. We are beginning to
learn the merits of different sampling approaches and
their alignment to named qualitative synthesis method-
ologies [38]. Limited but important evidence exists to
suggest that a few qualitative methodology keywords
may perform equally well to more extensive filter terms
[8, 16, 17, 44]. Strategies for retrieving books and theses
need to be specified with specific agendas remaining to
be advanced in terms of searching for process evalua-
tions or mixed-methods studies. Finally, progress has
been made in reporting QES, but these standards have
neither been validated in the appropriate community
nor extended to cover a broad range of QES method-
ologies [88]. The QES search methodology research
agenda remains ripe for harvesting.
