Background: Only one-third of young people who experience suicidal ideation attempt suicide. It is important to
identify factors which differentiate those who attempt suicide from those who experience suicidal ideation but do not
act on these thoughts. Methods: Participants were 4,772 members of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and
Children (ALSPAC), a UK population-based birth cohort. Suicide ideation and attempts were assessed at age 16 years
via self-report questionnaire. Multinomial regression was used to examine associations between factors that
differentiated adolescents in three groups: no suicidal ideation or attempts, suicidal ideation only and suicide
attempts. Analyses were conducted on an imputed data set based on those with complete outcome data (suicidal
thoughts and attempts) at age 16 years (N = 4,772). Results: The lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation and
attempts in the sample was 9.6% and 6.8% respectively. Compared to adolescents who had experienced suicidal
ideation, those who attempted suicide were more likely to report exposure to self-harm in others (adjusted OR for
family member self-harm: 1.95, for friend self-harm: 2.61 and for both family and friend self-harm: 5.26). They were
also more likely to have a psychiatric disorder (adjusted OR for depression: 3.63; adjusted OR for anxiety disorder:
2.20; adjusted OR for behavioural disorder: 2.90). Other risk factors included female gender, lower IQ, higher
impulsivity, higher intensity seeking, lower conscientiousness, a greater number of life events, body dissatisfaction,
hopelessness, smoking and illicit drug use (excluding cannabis). Conclusions: The extent of exposure to self-harm in
others and the presence of psychiatric disorder most clearly differentiate adolescents who attempt suicide from those
who only experience suicidal ideation. Further longitudinal research is needed to explore whether these risk factors
predict progression from suicidal ideation to attempts over time. Keywords: Suicide attempt; ideation; suicidal
thoughts; ALSPAC; self-harm.
Introduction
Thoughts of suicide (suicidal ideation) are common
in adolescents and are a well-established risk factor
for suicidal behaviour (Nock et al., 2008). Although
many risk and protective factors for suicidal beha-
viour have been identified, little is known about the
factors that differentiate those most likely to attempt
suicide from those who only think about suicide.
Recent findings from epidemiological and meta-
analytical studies suggest that many well-estab-
lished risk factors for suicide (including depression,
hopelessness and impulsivity) strongly predict the
development of suicidal ideation, but only weakly
predict attempts among those thinking about suicide
(Kessler, Borges, & Walters, 1999; May & Klonsky,
2016; Nock et al., 2009, 2013). Identifying factors
that best distinguish between these groups of ado-
lescents has important implications for both clinical
practice and suicide theory.
Recent theoretical models of suicide, including the
interpersonal theory (IPT) (Van Orden et al., 2010),
the integrated motivational–volitional (IMV) model
(O’Connor, 2011) and the three-step theory (3ST)
(Klonsky & May, 2015) all fit within an ‘ideation to
action’ framework (Klonsky, Qiu, & Saffer, 2017),
which posits that the development of suicidal ideation
and progression from ideation to attempts are distinct
processes with separate risk factors and explana-
tions. According to the IPT, perceptions of low belong-
ingness and high burdensomeness contribute to
desire for suicide, but acquired capability for suicide
is required to facilitate a potentially lethal attempt.
The IMV model proposes that defeat and entrapment
(termed ‘motivational factors’) increase the likelihood
that suicidal ideation will emerge, and that a collec-
tion of ‘volitional’ factors (e.g. acquired capability,
access to lethal means, exposure to suicidal beha-
viour, impulsivity) explains the propensity to act on
suicidal thoughts. The 3ST is the most recently
developed theory and suggests that suicidal ideation
and attempts are explained by a combination of four
factors: pain, hopelessness, connectedness and sui-
cide capability (dispositional, learned and practical).
Suicide capability (i.e. the degree to which an
individual feels able to make a suicide attempt) is a

 key determinant in each of the three models. Factors
thought
to
be
related
to
this
concept
include
increased
fearlessness
about
death;
persistence
through pain and distress; exposure to self-harm in
others; knowledge about and access to lethal means;
and previous non-suicidal self-harm. A recent review
of the literature found factors related to increased
suicide capability were consistently associated with
suicide attempts amongst those with ideation (Klon-
sky et al., 2017).
There is increasing evidence from both clinical and
population-based samples that one of these risk fac-
tors, exposure to self-harm in others, reliably distin-
guishes between young people with suicidal ideation
and attempts (Asarnow et al., 2008; Dhingra, Bodus-
zek,&O’Connor,2015;O’Connor& Nock, 2014).Other
factors that have been found to be associated with
suicide attempts amongst ideators in this age group
include mental health problems, aggression, impulsiv-
ity, substance abuse, female gender, stressful life
events,
abuse,
relationship
problems,
pregnancy
events and factors relating to service use/treatment
(Asarnow et al., 2008; Borges, Benjet, Medina-Mora,
Orozco, & Nock, 2008; Goldston et al., 2016; Nock
et al., 2013; O’Connor, Rasmussen, & Hawton, 2012;
Taliaferro & Muehlenkamp, 2014). However, effect
sizes are often small,andfindings havefrequently been
inconsistentacrossstudiesorhavenotbeenreplicated.
Therefore, more research is needed to understand this
important issue, including the consideration of addi-
tional risk factors which have not previously been
investigated using an ‘ideation to action’ approach.
Much of the existing research in this area has been
limited to small and/or unrepresentative samples.
Previous studies have also typically relied on retro-
spective reporting of the occurrence and timing of
risk factors which may be subject to recall bias. The
present study uses data from a large UK population-
based birth cohort to (a) explore risk factors for
adolescent suicidal ideation and attempts and (b)
identify
factors
that
distinguish
between
these
groups. We compared a wide range of recognised risk
factors
between
three
groups:
those
who
had
attempted suicide, those who had thought about
suicide but never made an attempt and those without
any suicide history. Our analyses were exploratory,
given the limited research in this area. However, as
suicide capability is a key component of the theoret-
ical models of suicide, we hypothesised that putative
risk factors related to increased suicide capability
(such as exposure to self-harm in others) would most
clearly differentiate between those with a history of
ideation and those who had attempted suicide.
Methods
Sample
The
Avon
Longitudinal
Study
of
Parents
and
Children
(ALSPAC) is a population-based birth cohort study examining
influences on health and development across the life course.
The ALSPAC core enrolled sample consists of 14,541 pregnant
women resident in the former county of Avon in South West
England
(United
Kingdom),
with
expected
delivery
dates
between 1 April 1991 and 31 December 1992 (Boyd et al.,
2013). Of the 14,062 live births, 13,798 were singletons/
firstborn of twins and were alive at 1 year of age. Participants
have been followed up regularly since recruitment through
questionnaires
and
research
clinics.
Information
about
ALSPAC is available at (http://www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac),
which includes details of all available data via a fully search-
able data dictionary (http://www.bris.ac.uk/alspac/researc
hers/data-access/data-dictionary). Ethical approval for the
study was obtained from the ALSPAC Law and Ethics commit-
tee. Written informed consent was obtained after the procedure
(s) had been fully explained.
The present investigation is based on the subsample of
4,772 children who completed a self-report questionnaire on
suicidal ideation and behaviours at mean age of 16 years
8 months (Kidger, Heron, Lewis, Evans, & Gunnell, 2012). The
postal questionnaire was sent to 9,370 participants of whom
4,850 (51.8%) returned it, and 4,772 responded to the ques-
tions
on
self-harm
and
suicidal
ideation.
Questionnaire
responders were more likely than non-responders to be female,
to be white, have a lower parity, have a mother with higher
education, have a higher household income and a higher
parental social class; they were also less likely to have
experienced overcrowding (Table S1).
Measures
Outcome measure: Lifetime history of suicidal
ideation and attempts.
The questions included in the
ALSPAC questionnaire were based on those used in the Child
and Adolescent Self-harm in Europe (CASE) study (Madge
et al., 2008). Suicidal ideation was assessed with the question
‘Have you ever thought of killing yourself, even if you would not
really do it?’ Response options for this question were ‘yes’ or
‘no’. Self-harm was assessed with the question ‘Have you ever
hurt yourself on purpose in any way (e.g. by taking an overdose
of pills, or by cutting yourself)?’ Those who responded posi-
tively were then asked a series of follow-up questions to
establish suicidal intent. Participants were classified as having
self-harmed with suicidal intent if (a) when asked about the
reasons why they hurt themselves on the most recent occasion,
they selected the response option ‘I wanted to die’ or (b) they
responded positively to the question ‘On any of the occasions
when you have hurt yourself on purpose, have you ever
seriously wanted to kill yourself?’. Individuals may self-harm
on multiple occasions for different reasons. Throughout the
paper, we refer to those with a lifetime history of suicidal self-
harm as having ‘attempted suicide’, but recognise that many
individuals in this group will have also engaged in episodes of
non-suicidal self-harm.
Risk factors.
A description of the risk factors examined in
this study is provided in Table 1. The selection of risk factors
was informed by psychological models of suicide and by
previous literature. These risk factors are all known to be
associated with self-harm/suicide; however, many have not
been examined within an ‘ideation to action’ framework before.
ALSPAC is a longitudinal study and participants have
completed regular assessments since birth. The timing of risk
factors was dependent on the age at which the data were
collected and ranges from birth to age 16 years. Several risk
factors were collected at the same time as the outcome
measures (age 16 years). These included sensation seeking;
exposure to self-harm in friends and family; life events; and
hopelessness. Risk factors collected prior to the age 16-year
assessment
included
gender;
IQ;
executive
function;

Possible confounders.
Additional analyses controlled for
the possible confounding effects of child gender and socioeco-
nomic position (SEP). We did not adjust for additional con-
founders, as our aim was to identify potential differences in
risk factors for suicidal thoughts and attempts rather than to
build the most parsimonious prediction model.
Socioeconomic position was assessed via maternal question-
naire and included (a) average weekly household disposable
income recorded at age 3 and 4 years, divided into quintiles and
rescaled to account for family size, composition and estimated
housing benefits (Gregg, Propper, & Washbrook, 2008); (b)
social class (professional/managerial or other, the highest of
maternal or paternal social class was used) identified during
pregnancy and (c) highest maternal educational attainment
(less than O-level, O-level, A-Level or university degree) mea-
sured during pregnancy (O-levels and A-levels are school
qualifications taken around age 16 and 18 years respectively).
The number of participants with complete data on suicidal
outcomes and all included covariates was 4,097.
Statistical analysis
Multinomial regression was used to examine associations
between each individual risk factor and a three-category
outcome: no suicidal ideation or attempts, suicidal ideation
only and suicide attempts. Models were adjusted for sex and
SEP. To obtain a direct comparison between suicidal ideation
and attempts, each model was re-estimated with an alternative
reference group to provide this additional information. A risk
factor was considered to be associated with an outcome if the
confidence interval did not include the null (p value <.05).
Continuous risk factors were standardised before analysis to
create Z scores with a mean of 0 and a SD of 1. We explored the
possibility of nonlinearity by dividing continuous risk factors
into quintiles and testing whether a categorical variable was a
better fit to the data using the likelihood ratio test. Extraver-
sion showed evidence of a ‘J-shape’ relationship, and so this
variable was split into three categories prior to analysis (lowest
quintile, highest quintile, middle quintiles). All analyses were
conducted using Stata version 14.
Primary analyses were conducted on an imputed data set
based on those with complete data on suicidal ideation and
attempts (n = 4,772) (see Appendix S1). Results of the primary
analysis are presented in Table 2 and Table S3. A comparison
of the estimates from the complete case and imputed data
analysis is presented in Table S4a,b; effect estimates were
broadly consistent in the imputed and complete case analysis.
Results
Of the 4,772 participants with complete outcome data
at age 16 years, 3,991 (83.6%) reported no suicidal
ideation
or
attempts,
456
(9.6%)
reported
suicidal ideationonly and 325 (6.8%) reporteda suicide
attempt.
Descriptive
information
on
risk
factors
according to outcome group is provided in Table S2.
Those with a history of suicidal ideation or attempts
generally had higher levels of risk factors than those
without. Risk factor levels were also generally higher
amongst those who had made a suicide attempt than
those who had only thought about suicide.
Findings from the multinomial logistic regression
analyses are shown in Table 2 and Table S3. These
analyses
are
based
on
an
imputed
data
set
(N = 4,772). The ORs in Table S3 indicate the like-
lihood of membership in the suicidal ideation group
and the suicide attempt group relative to the group
without suicidal ideation or attempts. Most of the
risk factors we investigated were associated with
either suicidal ideation, suicide attempts or both
outcomes when compared to those without any
suicidal ideation or attempts (Table S3). The ORs in
Table 2 indicate the likelihood that individuals with
suicidal ideation also attempted suicide.

Distinguishing suicide ideators from attempters
95
 and those who had made an attempt. Over half of the
risk factors we considered distinguished between
those with ideation and attempts, however, many
had small effects. Notably larger effect sizes were
found for exposure to self-harm in family/friends,
mental health disorders and also smoking and illicit
drug use (excluding cannabis).
Recent theoretical models all emphasise the role of
‘suicide capability’ in the progression from suicidal
ideation to attempts (Klonsky & May, 2015; O’Connor,
2011; Van Orden et al., 2010). This capability is
thought to be developed and enhanced through expo-
sure to painful and provocative events, which lead to
an increased tolerance to pain, fear and death. Our
findings are consistent with this idea, as one of the
factors which most clearly differentiated between
ideation and attempts – exposure to self-harm in
friends/family – may serve to increase the acquired
capability for suicide. Another factor thought to
increase suicide capability is non-suicidal self-harm;
however, it was not possible to identify whether
participants in this study who reported a suicide
attempt had also engaged in non-suicidal self-harm.
Compared to ideators, those who acted on their
thoughts were more likely to have been exposed to
self-harm in others. Moreover, there was evidence of
a dose–response effect, as associations were notably
larger when participants were exposed to self-harm
in both friends and family [OR 5.26]. Previous
research has shown family history to be a risk factor
for suicidal behaviour, over and above the risk
associated with psychiatric disorder, and exposure
has been shown to differentiate between suicidal
ideation
and
attempts
in
several
other
studies
(Asarnow et al., 2008; Dhingra et al., 2015; O’Con-
nor et al., 2012). The potential mechanisms under-
lying this relationship require further study but
could include genetic influences, imitation, social
transmission and assortative relating. In contrast to
these findings, a recent study of hospitalised ado-
lescents found no association between family history
of
suicidal
behaviour
and
suicidal
ideation/be-
haviours (Goldston et al., 2016). Our sample was
population-based, and we were not able to explore
associations
with
hospitalisation/service
use.
Future research is needed to explore whether those
who are hospitalised for mental health problems are
more likely to be exposed to self-harm as this would
have important implications for treatment.
Other
risk
factors
that
distinguished
suicide
attempters from ideators were smoking and illicit
drug use (excluding cannabis). In contrast, heavy
drinking and cannabis use did not differ across
these groups, highlighting the importance of exam-
ining substances individually. Alcohol is the sub-
stance that has been researched most widely in the
literature, as it is thought that its intoxicating
effects may increase aggression, impair decision-
making and lower inhibition, making it more likely
that
someone
will
act
on
suicidal
thoughts.
However, most previous studies, including a recent
meta-analysis of adults, have not found alcohol
problems to be elevated amongst attempters com-
pared to ideators (Borges et al., 2008; ten Have, van
Dorsselaer, & de Graaf, 2013; May & Klonsky,
2016; Nock et al., 2009; Taliaferro & Muehlen-
kamp, 2014). The same meta-analysis reported a
moderate effect for drug use disorders (May &
Klonsky, 2016), which is consistent with our find-
ings. It may also be that substance use is a proxy
for particular types of coping in response to stress
which are maladaptive.
Strong associations have previously been reported
between smoking and a range of suicide-related
outcomes, even after adjustment for potential con-
founders, such as depression (Bronisch, H€
ofler, &
Lieb, 2008; King et al., 2001). However, few studies
have examined smoking within an ‘ideation to action’
framework. A cross-sectional study found suicide
attempters were more likely than ideators to be
current smokers (King et al., 2001). However, in the
National
Comorbidity
Survey,
Kessler,
Borges,
Sampson, Miller, and Nock (2009) found that early-
onset nicotine dependence was prospectively asso-
ciated with suicide plans but not attempts amongst
those with ideation.
With regard to mental health disorders, previous
studies of adolescents suggest that depression/dys-
thymia and disorders characterised by agitation and
poor impulse control best distinguish between those
with ideation and attempts, as found in this study
(Nock et al., 2013). However, like for many risk
factors, findings have been conflicting. Although
depressive disorder at age 15 years clearly distin-
guished between those with ideation and attempts in
this sample, it was relatively uncommon (2.6% of
ideators and 8.3% of attempters) and so would have
limited sensitivity as a predictor.
Other variables that have been highlighted in the
literature
include
hopelessness
and
impulsivity.
Whilst we found both these factors differentiated
between thoughts and attempts, effects were rela-
tively small, indicating that other factors may be
more useful at distinguishing between these groups.
In addition, given the debate about how impulsivity
is operationalised (Gvion & Apter, 2011) and that the
assessment of hopelessness was limited to two
items, future research should explore the respective
roles of these factors in the context of ideation to
action in more detail.
Strengths and limitations
This study offers many improvements over previous
work. Data were from a large population-based birth
cohort containing information on suicidal ideation
and attempts from over 4,000 adolescents. This is
important as most episodes of suicidal behaviour do
not present to specialist services (Kidger et al.,
2012). We also explored a wide range of risk factors

 from multiple domains. However, findings need to be
interpreted in light of several limitations. First,
whereas ALSPAC is a longitudinal study, lifetime
history of suicidal ideation and attempts were both
assessed at the same time point, when participants
were aged 16 years. These outcomes were assessed
via self-report, which may be subject to misreporting
(Mars et al., 2016). For example, we have previously
shown that more recent and more severe episodes of
self-harm are more likely to be reported consistently
over time (Mars et al., 2016). Suicidal thoughts are
less severe than suicide attempts and may be more
easily forgotten. This may explain why our ratio of
ideation to attempts is lower than found in some
previous studies (Nock et al., 2013; O’Connor &
Nock, 2014; Taliaferro & Muehlenkamp, 2014).
Moreover, our measure of suicidal ideation was
assessed with a single item, which does not allow
us to establish severity. It is possible that findings
may differ for more ‘active’ rather than passive
suicidal ideation.
Second, the age of onset of suicidal ideation and
attempts was not known; therefore, for some variables,
(particularly those measured close to age 16) reverse
causation is possible. We found that associations
tended to be stronger for those variables measured
more proximally to the outcome (e.g. exposure to self-
harm, psychiatric disorders), although this was not
always the case (e.g. there was little evidence of an
association for alcohol or cannabis use). Moreover, for
some variables (gender, IQ, executive functioning,
personality), the timing of assessment would have little
or no impact on the results, as these variables are fairly
stable or fixed over time. As the study involved sec-
ondary analysis of an existing data set, the selection of
measures was dependent on data availability, and we
were not able to test hypotheses regarding the timing of
exposure, or whether the findings would differ accord-
ing to developmental stage.
Third, we only adjusted for a limited number of
confounding variables (gender and SEP) and it is
possible that there may be residual confounding.
However, it was not our aim to identify independent
predictors and to examine this adequately would
require a separate theory-driven analytical model for
each exposure. This was beyond the scope of the
current paper but is an important area for future
research. We did not correct for multiple testing as
analyses were exploratory, and a number of risk
factors are likely highly correlated. Our results are
therefore in need of replication, given the large
number of tests conducted.
Fourth, analyses were conducted on an imputed
data set based on those with complete outcome data
at age 16 years (N = 4,772). Our imputation analysis
assumes follow-up depends only on those individual
characteristics observed and included in the impu-
tation model (see Appendix S1). If this assumption
(the missing at random, MAR, assumption) is not
true, then these results may be biased. Moreover,
responders and non-responders to the self-harm
questionnaire differed on a range of characteristics
(see Table S1), and it is possible that this non-
random non-response may limit the generalisability
of our results.
Finally, our study sample was a population-based
sample of 16-year-old adolescents, and findings may
not generalise to fatal attempts, clinical samples or
to other age groups (including younger adolescents).
It is likely that the risk factors involved in progres-
sion from ideation to attempts may vary across the
life course. This possibility should be investigated in
future research.
Conclusion and clinical implications
The results of this study have important implications
for both clinical practice and suicide theory. Identify-
ing factors that differentiate between those with
suicidal ideation and attempts can help to improve
risk assessment (when treating individuals with sui-
cidal ideation) and identify potential targets for inter-
vention. Our findings suggest that youths who make
suicide attempts are likely to have had exposure to
self-harm in others, underscoring the importance of
practitioners considering the social context in which
suicide attempts occur and the possibility of mod-
elling, contagion and environmental reinforces of self-
harm behaviour. Our results also highlight the con-
tinued importance of identifying and treating mental
health problems, as they are strongly associated with
the development of suicidal ideation and likely have a
role in progression from thoughts to behaviour. It is
also important for suicide prevention efforts to con-
sider
disorders
other
than
depression.
Future
research should build on these findings and prospec-
tively follow-up those with suicidal ideation, to explore
whether the factors identified in this study predict
subsequent suicide risk.

Key points
• A third of young people who experience suicidal ideation attempt suicide. However, little is known about the
factors that differentiate those most likely to attempt suicide from those who only think about suicide.
• We examined this issue in a population-based sample of over 4,700 adolescents.
• The factors that most clearly differentiated between those with a history of suicidal ideation and attempts
were exposure to self-harm in friends/family and psychiatric disorder.
• Prospective studies are needed to explore whether these risk factors predict future suicide attempts.
