esides maintaining normal oxygen saturation, adequate 
blood pressure control is one of the major concerns of 
anesthesia providers caring for patients undergoing 
surgical procedures. Although it is commonly accepted that 
severe hypotension is poorly tolerated, there is mounting evi-
dence that longer-term outcomes may be affected by extended 
periods of less severe hypotension in patients surviving the 
immediate perioperative period.1–12 However, relatively little 
is known about what blood pressure may be acceptable with 
the goal of getting patients not only through the surgery alive 
(without major intraoperative complications), but also mini-
mizing any longer-term adverse outcome. Efforts to date have 
been largely concerned with trying to identify some distinct 
blood pressure threshold deemed to be critically low, consis-
tent with the design limitation of conventional blood pressure 
monitors, which typically lack the ability to alert to anything 
but the most recent reading falling below a certain threshold, or 
the time spent below some particular threshold. In either case, 
patients are being categorized in an essentially binary fashion 
with regard to risk such that any potential intervention is either 
deemed unnecessary or basically too late by the time the cri-
terion indicating significant hypotension is met. Therefore, it 
would be desirable to find a method that might allow risk to be 
quantified in a progressive rather than binary fashion.

BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that longer-term postsurgical outcome may be adversely 
affected by less than severe hypotension under anesthesia. However, evidence-based guide-
lines are unavailable. The present study was designed to develop a method for identifying 
patients at increased risk of death within 30 days in association with the severity and duration 
of intraoperative hypotension.
METHODS: Intraoperative mean arterial blood pressure recordings of 152,445 adult patients 
undergoing noncardiac surgery were analyzed for periods of time accumulated below each one 
of the 31 thresholds between 75 and 45 mm Hg (hypotensive exposure times). In a develop-
ment cohort of 35,904 patients, the associations were sought between each of these 31 
cumulative hypotensive exposure times and 30-day postsurgical mortality. On the basis of 
covariable-adjusted percentage increases in the odds of mortality per minute elapsed of hypo-
tensive exposure time, certain sets of exposure time limits were calculated that portended cer-
tain percentage increases in the odds of mortality. A novel risk-scoring method was conceived 
by counting the number of exposure time limits that had been exceeded within each respec-
tive set, one of them being called the SLUScore. The validity of this new method in identifying 
patients at increased risk was tested in a multicenter validation cohort consisting of 116,541 
patients from Cleveland Clinic, Vanderbilt and Saint Louis Universities. Data were expressed as 
95% confidence interval, P < .05 considered significant.
RESULTS: Progressively greater hypotensive exposures were associated with greater 30-day mor-
tality. In the development cohort, covariable-adjusted (age, Charlson score, case duration, history 
of hypertension) exposure limits were identified for time accumulated below each of the thresholds 
that portended certain identical (5%–50%) percentage expected increases in the odds of mortality. 
These exposure time limit sets were shorter in patients with a history of hypertension. A novel risk 
score, the SLUScore (range 0–31), was conceived as the number of exposure limits exceeded for 
one of these sets (20% set). A SLUScore > 0 (average 13.8) was found in 40% of patients who had 
twice the mortality, adjusted odds increasing by 5% per limit exceeded. When tested in the valida-
tion cohort, a SLUScore > 0 (average 14.1) identified 35% of patients who had twice the mortality, 
each incremental limit exceeded portending a 5% compounding increase in adjusted odds of mor-
tality, independent of age and Charlson score (C = 0.73, 0.72–0.74, P < .05).
CONCLUSIONS: The SLUScore represents a novel method for identifying nearly 1 in every 
3 patients experiencing greater 30-day mortality portended by more severe intraoperative hypo-
tensive exposures.  (Anesth Analg 2017;124:1135–52)

ANESTHESIA & ANALGESIA
Hypotensive Exposures and Adverse Outcome
In this regard, modern electronic anesthesia information 
management systems (AIMS) offer the potential of more 
sophisticated clinical decision support (DSS) functionality 
by being able to take into consideration more comprehensive 
information, including pertinent preexisting conditions (such 
as a history of hypertension), as well as both the severity and 
the duration of patients’ deviation from certain vital sign 
ranges over the course of an entire case. Ideally, one of the 
desirable features of such systems could be “smart” alarms 
designed to detect and, preferentially, notify providers to cer-
tain levels of progressive risk for adverse outcome attribut-
able to such deviations that may be amenable, to some extent, 
to their mitigation.
With this goal in mind, the hypothesis was tested that 
postoperative outcome may be associated with not only the 
severity of hypotension, but also the duration of hypoten-
sive periods of time accumulated below a range of mean 
arterial blood pressure (MAP) thresholds that are com-
monly encountered during anesthesia. The specific goals 
were not to derive a predictive model for 30-day mortal-
ity; that is, to try to predict which patients will die. Rather, 
the goal was to create a method that would allow certain 
fractions of patients to be identified who may be at some 
increased risk portended by hypotensive exposures.
Toward that end, the specific objectives of the present 
study were 4-fold: (1) to assess the prevalence of intraopera-
tive hypotensive exposures; (2) to determine the association 
of intraoperative hypotensive exposures with 30-day postsur-
gical mortality after adjustment for those main confounding 
factors that are principally unalterable at the time of surgery 
(primarily patient age and comorbidity, but not necessarily 
surgical procedures that could conceivably be modified in 
the future in such a way that these might incur less risk and 
also potentially less hypotension if that should be deemed 
harmful and contributing to the overall risk); (3) to create a 
(logarithmic) ratio scale quantifying such (partially) adjusted 
risk associated with hypotensive exposures; (4) to accom-
plish the above while solely depending on routinely cap-
tured clinical information, with all its associated limitations 
including those of International Classification of Diseases, Ninth 
Revision (ICD-9) coding and the fact that vital signs may not 
be acquired more often than every 5 minutes consistent with 
the applicable monitoring standard. This was done to make 
any potential findings as easy as possible for other investiga-
tors to replicate without requiring any special equipment or 
technology other than the availability of a generic electronic 
medical record (EMR) and off-the-shelf AIMS.
METHODS
With approval from their respective institutional review 
boards, the Cleveland Clinic Anesthesia Information 
Management System, the Vanderbilt Medical Center, and 
the Saint Louis University Medical Center anesthesia data-
bases were queried for the intraoperative records of adult 
patients undergoing noncardiac procedures. Extracted 
information included patient demographics (age, sex); 
Charlson comorbidity score, derived from the patients’ list 
of preexisting diagnoses (problem list ICD-9 codes)13; type 
of anesthetic; case duration; cumulative amount of docu-
mented blood loss; minute-to-minute MAP values; and all-
cause mortality within 30 days of surgery, derived from the 
US Social Security Death Index Master File. As indicated 
above, while likely a rather strong confounding variable 
(for overall risk, as well as for the occurrence and sever-
ity of hypotension, see Discussion), procedural codes were 
not included nor was their actuarial risk adjusted for in the 
model for several reasons, including (1) that it would be dif-
ficult to do so given the wide variety of types of procedures 
and small numbers of sufficiently homogeneous procedures 
(see Discussion); (2) to not inadvertently adjust for some, 
as yet unidentified components of actuarial risk of these 
procedures which, once identified, might allow these risk 
portions to be potentially reduced in the future, such as, for 
instance, by becoming less invasive and incurring less exten-
sive hypotensive exposures that might possibly account for 
some portion of the total risk historically associated with 
certain procedures. This conundrum was discussed recently 
in connection with the “triple low” concept.7 Thus, “adjust-
ment” will be meant to indicate the limited adjustment of 
the various models for only explicitly stated confounding 
variables, not the types of procedure or their actuarial risk. 
The diagnosis of preoperative hypertension was considered 
and determined according to the presence of any one of 
several ICD-9 codes (401.xx; 402.xx; 403.xx; 404.xx; or 405.
xx). For each minute of every case, patients’ effective MAP 
was deemed to have been the largest of the most recent 
automatically acquired noninvasive MAP value (obtained 
within the immediately preceding 5-minute period) or the 
most recent invasive MAP value acquired contemporane-
ously (continuously recorded at 1-minute intervals), reject-
ing values of less than 30 mm Hg as presumed artifacts. For 
every patient, the cumulative periods of time were calcu-
lated for which the effective MAP was below each one of 
the array of 31 hypotensive thresholds ranging from 75 to 
45 mm Hg, using SQL Management Server 2008 and EXCEL 
2010 with VBA (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA).14 
An example of the cumulative hypotensive exposure times 
found in 1 patient is shown in Table 3 (on the left, with the 
gray background). Multivariable logistic regression analy-
ses were performed using Unistat 6.0 software (London, 
UK) to determine the association with mortality. Confidence 
intervals of interacting variables were calculated from the 
applicable covariance matrices. Data were expressed as 
median and quartiles or as mean and 95% confidence inter-
vals (CIs). P values less than .05 were considered indicating 
statistical significance.
Development Cohort
Multivariable logistic regression was employed to ascer-
tain within a development subset of patient records (35,904 
patients, undergoing surgery on Cleveland Clinic’s main 
campus between January 1, 2009, and September 30, 2010) 
any factors associated with increased 30-day mortality, 
including the respective amounts of time spent below each 
one of the 31 MAP thresholds between 75 and 45 mm Hg. A 
separate regression model was constructed for the respec-
tive times accumulated below each one of these 31 MAP 
thresholds. As a result, for each MAP threshold, the per-
centage increase in the odds of 30-day mortality was deter-
mined per minute of time accumulated. From these values, 
the numbers of minutes were calculated, for each of the 
MAP thresholds, to be expected as having to accumulate,

below that threshold, to portend certain identical percent-
age increases in the odds of 30-day mortality in the range 
between 5% and 50%. Within each of the resulting “smart 
exposure limit sets” of exposure times portending the same 
expected percentage increases in mortality odds, the fol-
lowing information was obtained: (1) fraction of patients 
exceeding one or more of these exposure limits; (2) num-
ber of exposure limits exceeded; (3) observed mortality of 
patients exceeding none of the limits; (4) observed mortal-
ity of patients exceeding one or more of these limits; (5) the 
adjusted increase in the odds of mortality per exposure time 
limit that had been exceeded. The exact algorithm of how to 
determine the number of exposure time limits exceeded for 
each of the “smart exposure limit sets” is described in detail 
in Table 3. The number of exposure limits exceeded of one 
of these “smart exposure limit sets,” the 20% limit set, was 
eventually selected to represent the SLUScore, a novel risk 
score portending an approximate 5% expected compound-
ing progression of the odds of 30-day mortality per incre-
ment (each additional exposure time limit exceeded). This 
selection was based on the slightly highest C-score of the 
regression model for this particular set of limits.
Validation Cohort
The validity of SLUScore in identifying fractions of patients 
at an increased risk of adverse outcomes was assessed in a 
validation cohort of another 116,541 patient records from 
3 different care settings (40,065 patients from Cleveland 
Clinic main campus, operated on between October 2010 
and May 2012; 26,676 patients from Vanderbilt Medical 
Center, operated on between January and December 2011; 
and 49,800 patients from Saint Louis University Medical 
Center, operated on between October 2007 and October 
2013), by comparing these patients’ cumulative intraopera-
tive hypotensive exposure times against the various “smart 
exposure limit sets” and calculating the numbers of expo-
sure limits exceeded, including the SLUScore, by using 
the algorithm described in Table 3. Within each “expo-
sure limit set,” the following information was reported: 
(1) fraction of patients exceeding any one or more of these 
exposure limits; (2) number of exposure limits exceeded; 
(3) observed mortality of patients exceeding none of the 
limits; (4) observed mortality of patients exceeding one or 
more of these limits; (5) the covariable-adjusted increase 
in the odds of mortality per exposure time limit exceeded.
RESULTS
Development of the SLUScore (Development 
Cohort)
Of a total of 44,968 cases originally retrieved from 
Cleveland Clinic’s main campus, complete sets of data 
were obtained for 35,904 cases of patients who survived 
the intraoperative period and experienced an overall all-
cause 30-day mortality of 1.8%. The median case duration 
was 179 (118–259) minutes, with anesthetic techniques 
consisting of inhalational anesthesia (82.9%), intravenous 
anesthesia (7.2%), spinal (4.9%), epidural (0.9%), periph-
eral nerve block (0.3%), and monitored anesthesia care 
(3.9%). Intraoperative hypotension was common, with 
MAP dropping below 75 mm Hg in 92% of cases and 
below 45 mm Hg in 10% of cases (Figure 1). Worsening 
hypotension (any amount of time spent below progres-
sively lower MAP thresholds) was reflected in larger 
cumulative amounts of time spent below each of the 31 
thresholds across the entire array of MAP thresholds 
(Figure 1; Table 1) and, associated with this, a progressive 
increase in 30-day mortality (Figure 1).4
Multivariable logistic regression (mean [CI]) identi-
fied patient age (1.043 [1.037–1.049], per year), Charlson 
comorbidity score (1.193 [1.161–1.227], per increment), and 
cumulative amount of blood loss (1.038 [1.027–1.049], per 
500 mL) as independent factors associated with increased 
30-day mortality. All subsequent analyses involving MAP 
were adjusted for these, as well as case duration. Two dif-
ferent models were constructed, one considering blood 
loss and one without. The reason for this distinction is that 
blood loss is typically only known after the fact (at the end 
of surgery), whereas the other data are available in real time 
when information gleaned from these risk models might be 
most useful in the future. The essentially analogous results 
for both these approaches are listed in Table 2. The rela-
tionship between the severity of hypotension (the hypo-
tensive MAP threshold dropped below), the cumulative 
amount of time spent below that threshold, and adjusted 
odds of 30-day mortality is listed in Table 2 and graphically 
depicted in Figure 2. As demonstrated in the figure, as well 
as in Table 2, dropping below progressively lower MAP 
thresholds portended a progressively greater increase in 
30-day mortality per unit of time accumulated below that 
threshold. For any given MAP threshold, patients carrying 
a preoperative diagnosis of hypertension (prevalence of 
40% according to the definition above) required less cumu-
lative time to be accrued below that threshold to incur the 
same increase in 30-day mortality as did patients without a 
history of hypertension (see Table 2, as well as red lines in 
Figure 2, depicting the intersection with the plane indicat-
ing identical 20% increases in the odds of mortality). The 
cumulative exposure times expected to portend the same 
percentage increase in the odds of 30-day mortality (“smart 
set exposure limits”), shown in Table 2 (pink background), 
were used to compare patients exceeding these limits with 
those not exceeding these limits, using the method and 
algorithm described in Table 3. The result of these analy-
ses is listed in Table 4. Within each set of “smart exposure 
limits,” patients exceeding these limits exhibited greater 
mortality than patients not exceeding these limits. The total 
increase in mortality depended on the number of exposure 
limits exceeded, with each incremental limit exceeded por-
tending a compounding further increase in the odds ratio 
for 30-day mortality (Table 4). On the basis of the slightly 
highest C-score of 0.80 (0.78–0.82), the 20% “smart set” of 
exposure limits resulting from the model without consid-
ering blood loss was selected as the basis for determining 
the so-called SLUScore, the novel risk score. The SLUScore 
was calculated, along with the number of exposure time 
limits exceeded of each of the other “smart exposure limit 
sets,” for each patient in the following analyses, to quantify 
hypotensive exposures and examine their association with 
outcome. The SLUScore exposure limits for patients with 
and without a history of hypertension are listed separately 
in Table 5.

ANESTHESIA & ANALGESIA
Hypotensive Exposures and Adverse Outcome
Validation of the SLUScore (Validation Cohort)
In an additional 116,541 patients studied at the 3 differ-
ent US health systems, cumulative hypotensive exposure 
times were compared with the various “smart set exposure 
limits” including the SLUScore limits (Table 5), choosing 
the limits according to whether or not patients carried a 
history of hypertension and calculating the total number 
of exposure limits that had been exceeded as described 
in Table 3. Within each set of “smart exposure limits,” 
patients exceeding one or more of these limits exhibited 
greater mortality than patients not exceeding any of these 
limits. The increase in mortality depended on the number 
of exposure limits exceeded, with each incremental limit 
exceeded portending a compounding further increase in 
the odds of mortality (Table 6). With overall 30-day mor-
tality being in the same range (between 1.4% and 1.8%), 
there was a similar experience with regard to incidence 
and impact of the SLUScore in patients from each of the 
3 health systems: the SLUScore was >0 in about one-third 
of patients, and 30-day mortality was approximately dou-
bled in patients with a SLUScore > 0 compared with that 
of patients with a SLUScore of 0, associated with an aver-
age SLUScore of 14.1 and an approximate 5% compound-
ing increase in adjusted odds per SLUScore increment 
(Table 7; Figure 3).
When studied in these same 116,541 patients, the asso-
ciation of a progressive SLUScore with 30-day mortal-
ity was independent of that of the Charlson comorbidity 
score (Table 6; Figure 3). Given the fact that lower Charlson 
comorbidity scores were more prevalent than higher ones, 
overall more patients’ adverse outcomes were associ-
ated with their higher SLUScore than their comorbidity 
as reflected in the Charlson comorbidity score (Table 6; 
Figure 3).15
Because the SLUScore exposure limits had not been adjusted 
for the types of surgical procedure or their actuarial risk—for 
the reasons mentioned above—we attempted to examine the 
potential post hoc association of patients’ SLUScores with 
observed total risk for 5 distinct types of procedures identified 
in the Saint Louis University patient cohort subset (Figure 4). 
As shown in the figure, procedures carrying a progressively 
greater observed total risk were associated with a progressively 
greater fraction of patients with a SLUScore > 0, a greater aver-
age SLUScore > 0, as well as a greater average overall SLUScore 
(Figure 4), thus reinforcing the concern about confounding. 
However, the uniformly small numbers of deaths precluded a 
determination as to what extent greater mortality risk may have 
been attributable to a (as yet unknown) procedural versus some 
other risk portion that was ostensibly at least associated with (if 
not potentially caused or mediated by) hypotensive exposures. 
Regardless of this eventual distinction, which remains to be 
sorted out in future studies, ideally ones that either adjust for 
procedure or are designed to specifically apply only to certain 
types of procedures, the SLUScore as currently conceived man-
aged to do what it had been designed for, namely to identify 
that fraction of patients whose greater risk was portended by 
greater hypotensive exposures (a SLUScore > 0). This latter, 
most salient observation would of course remain no less true 
if the SLUScore limits had not been determined by any logis-
tic regression analyses but rather arbitrarily set and merely 
applied as nominal limits for maximum permissible hypoten-
sive exposure times.
DISCUSSION
Although considered important, the role of intraopera-
tive blood pressure with regard to long-term outcome after 
surgery remains poorly understood. The present findings 
demonstrate a significant independent association between 
the cumulative times accrued below a wide range of MAP 
thresholds commonly experienced during noncardiac anes-
thesia (and not generally considered to be of concern by 
most anesthesia providers) and increased all-cause mortality 
within 30 days after surgery. Consequently, an approximate 
doubling of mortality was observed in 1 of every 3 of over 
Figure 1. Different hypotensive thresholds are 
indicative not only of time spent below that 
threshold but of differences in the average cumu-
lative time spent below any mean arterial blood 
pressure (MAP) between 75 and 45 mm Hg. While 
nearly all patients crossed the 75 mm Hg thresh-
old, incidence decreased (right blue plane, black 
curve), whereas 30-day mortality increased (red 
curve) of patients crossing progressively lower 
MAP thresholds.4

ANESTHESIA & ANALGESIA
Hypotensive Exposures and Adverse Outcome
150,000 patients at each of the 3 different health care institu-
tions. With approximately 200 million surgical procedures 
being performed annually worldwide, universally rather 
high mortality has raised questions regarding underlying 
causes.16 Unlike previous attempts at identifying risk con-
ceivably associated with intraoperative hypotension, this 
novel approach considers any blood pressure a patient may 
have experienced for the amount of time it was observed 
over the course of an entire case. Accordingly, in agreement 
with the existing literature, there does not seem to be one 
particular pressure threshold having to be dropped below 
to portend greater risk for 30-day mortality versus being 
spared from such an effect. Rather, increased risk appears to 
be related to an interaction between severity and duration of 
hypotension below a wide range of commonly encountered 
MAP thresholds over periods of time that are well within the 
currently accepted standard of care. This important, recipro-
cal relationship between severity and duration of hypoten-
sion is captured by the SLUScore, a novel risk index based on 
time accumulated at hypotensive MAPs (below 75–45 mm 
Hg) exceeding certain exposure limits, with each incremental 
limit exceeded (SLUScore increment) determined to portend 
a further compounding approximate 5% progression in the 
odds of mortality. In this sense, “smart set exposure limits” 
appear to be somewhat analogous to diving charts, suggest-
ing that less time may be permissible to be spent at a lower 
MAP (a greater depth) while incurring a similar amount of 
risk (Table 5). The idea of accrual of time spent below a cer-
tain threshold (80 mm Hg systolic) exhibiting an association 
with progressively worse longer-term outcome was intro-
duced by the pioneering work of Monk et al.1 The present 
data suggest that such progressive risk does not appear to 
be sufficiently quantified by examining time accrued below 
just one MAP threshold but rather below a wide range of 
commonly encountered MAP thresholds. Varying limits of 
cumulative exposure time need to be exceeded below these 
MAP thresholds to incur the same percentage increases in 
risk, each of these time limits being different for patients 
with or without a preoperative diagnosis of hypertension 
(Figure 2; Tables 2 and 5). A reason this type of approach 
might not have been contemplated in the past is that its inher-
ent complexity would have made it impractical to be applied 
manually in the operating room or to be implemented by 
device manufacturers of free-standing blood pressure moni-
tors. However, with the increasing availability of AIMS and 
the arrival of DSS functionality offering nearly instanta-
neous access to all required information, it has become con-
ceivable to be able to detect and provide notification to more 
complex information such as the SLUScore in near real time. 
It is not clear whether patient outcome might be improved 
by knowing and acting on this information in the operating 
room, such as through elevating the patient’s blood pres-
sure, opting for an intervention that would ideally correct 
the underlying pathophysiologic abnormality. At present, it 
is not conclusively clear what any such underlying patho-
physiologic abnormality might be. However, two indepen-
dent observations and considerations point at the likelihood 
that hypotensive exposures might be associated with hypo-
perfusion, most likely of splanchnic vascular beds. First, 
when examining the observed SLUScore limits in relation to 
the MAP deviation from 75 mm Hg, it appears that every 
5.2 mm Hg decrease in MAP caused the SLUScore limits to 
be reduced by 50%, suggesting that any (hypothetical) blood 
flow deficit would have to have approximately doubled to 
produce an ischemic insult of equivalent severity (implied 
flow deficit × SLUScore time limit), portending identical 
risk. This apparent decrease in blood flow not being linear 
with decreasing MAP would suggest a progressive increase 
in vascular resistance, leading to an estimated 85% reduction 
in blood flow to occur between an MAP of 75 and 60 mm Hg 
 
(Figure 5). Because it is well understood that systemic hypo-
tension is being responded to physiologically with sympa-
thetic vasoconstriction and renin-angiotensin activation, 
both of which would tend to spare the heart and brain at the 
expense of other vascular, most notably splanchnic beds, it 
is conceivable that hypotensive vasoconstriction might have 
led to splanchnic hypoperfusion.17 This notion is supported 
by a second observation: when examined in 2618 general 
surgical patient records captured in Saint Louis University’s 
American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality 
Figure 2. Relationship between severity (x-axis) 
and duration (y-axis) of cumulative hypotensive 
exposures with 30-day mortality (z-axis).4 Although 
even extended exposures below a mean arterial 
blood pressure (MAP) of 75 had relatively little 
impact, even just a few minutes accumulated 
below an MAP of 50 portended a sharp increase 
in 30-day mortality. Note that for each hypoten-
sive MAP threshold, less time was required to be 
accumulated in patients with a history of hyper-
tension than in normal patients to incur the same 
relative increase in the odds ratio for 30-day mor-
tality, the red lines indicating a 20% increase in 
normal patients (dotted line) versus patients with 
a history of hypertension (solid line).

Let xi be the number of minutes a given patient has accumulated below MAP i, with 75 ≥ i ≥ 45 (shown with gray background, medians in Table 1).
Let yi,j be a certain exposure limit in minutes, accumulated below an MAP of i (with 75 ≥ i ≥ 45), representing an increase in mortality odds by j% (Table 2).
Let ∑j be the sum of the number of times xi is greater than yi,j for the set of exposure limits listed in Table 2 (representing increases in mortality odds by j%): >>

Thus, the sum of exposure limits exceeded ∑j (x,y) of a given set of limits j representing an increase in mortality odds by j% is incremented by 1 for each MAP i where xi > yi,j. If none of the limits is exceeded for the limit 
set j, the result is ∑j = 0. Otherwise the result ∑j is the sum of limits exceeded, with a maximum value of 31 (in case each of the 31 applicable exposure limits yi,j are exceeded by the patient’s observed hypotensive 
exposure times xi).
Example (using the exposure limit sets derived from the model without blood loss for normotensivec patients, see Table 2).
Patient is normotensive. The numbers with the gray background submission represent the cumulative number of minutes the patient spent below the various MAP thresholds.
Shown limits apply to patients without a history of hypertension.
aSee Table 2.
bSLUScore. This patient has the indicated numbers of limits exceeded for each of the various limit sets and, in particular, a SLUScore of 20 (j = 20).
cThe limit sets established for hypertensive patients are applied for those patients with a history of hypertension (see Table 2, right half).

Improvement Program (NSQIP) outcomes database for 
which the SLUScore happened to have been determined as 
part of the above analysis, a progressively greater SLUScore 
was found to be associated with progressively greater post-
operative morbidity in terms of worse renal function, deep 
(but not superficial or incisional) wound infection, and 
septic shock (Figure 6, unpublished data). Together, these 
findings support the possibility of ischemic injury and sug-
gest that, in most circumstances, benefit of any potential 
intervention might likely depend on the ability to improve 
blood flow rather than subjecting it to even greater reduc-
tion through the indiscriminate administration of vasopres-
sors. It, of course, remains unknown whether (any type of) 
intervention in response to a rising SLUScore in the oper-
ating room might lead to improved outcome. This intrigu-
ing question is being addressed in an upcoming prospective 
clinical effectiveness trial,18,19 in which DSS functionality 
is being used not only to detect hypotensive exposures in 
real time, but also to randomize provider notification to 
these conditions. This is similar to how DSS is being lever-
aged in other studies that were either recently completed20

SLUScore limits for cumulative time spent below the various MAP thresholds 
between 75 and 45 mm Hg.
The SLUScore of any given patient is calculated by comparing exposure 
times accumulated at an MAP below these various thresholds against the 
above exposure time limits (the 20% “smart set” limits), choosing the limits 
according the absence or presence of a history of hypertension. If none of 
the limits are exceeded, the SLUScore is 0. Otherwise, the SLUScore is 
calculated as the sum of the number of exposure time limits exceeded as 
described in greater detail in Table 3 (patent pending14).

> 0 observed in 116

30-day mortality to be approximately doubled in around that one third of patients with a SLUScore > 0.15
Figure 3. Number of deaths and 30-day all-cause mortality of a total of 116,541 patients from the 3 different organizations with regard to their 
Charlson comorbidity score and SLUScore. Both scoring systems independently portended decreased 30-day survival in association with progres-
sively greater scores. With nearly 90% of patients having a Charlson score ≤2, overall more patients’ decreased survival occurred in association with 
a progressively greater SLUScore than a progressively greater Charlson score.15
Figure 4. Association between the observed mortality (red, left abscissa) of 5 distinct, sufficiently homogeneous surgical procedures identified in 
the limited Saint Louis University patient cohort subset (ranging from inguinal hernia repairs to abdominal aortic aneurysm repairs, performed in the 
indicated number of patients) with these patients’ final SLUScores in terms of incidence of SLUScore > 0 (orange, left abscissa), average SLUScore > 
0 (light blue, right abscissa), overall average SLUScore (blue, right abscissa), and observed number of deaths (black, right abscissa). Please note that 
progressively “higher risk” procedures (those with a higher observed mortality) were also associated with progressively higher SLUScores, meaning 
that these procedures were associated with greater hypotensive exposures as quantified by their SLUScore. This finding reinforces the idea that the 
SLUScore cannot be interpreted as any direct measure of the risk associated with hypotensive exposures alone because the type of surgical proce-
dure during which they occur remains a confounding factor that could not be adjusted for because of the low absolute number of deaths incurred with 
each type of procedure. Still, the SLUScore accomplishes what it was meant and designed to do, namely to help allow those substantial fractions of 
patients to be identified who are at some greater risk, portended by their greater hypotensive exposures, because of whatever (essentially unknown) 
procedural risk in conjunction with worse hypotension, independent of other less modifiable factors such as patient age and comorbidity. Both proce-
dural risk (through more refined and potentially less-invasive surgical procedures) and ostensibly some portion of overall risk apparently associated 
with—if not potentially caused by—accompanying hypotensive exposures (through efforts aimed at minimizing any prolonged periods of hypotension) 
may be principally amenable to potential future reduction resulting in lower SLUScores and improved outcomes.

or are currently still underway,21 examining the impact of 
intraoperative anesthesia provider notification to systolic 
hypotension20 or to the “triple low” condition, a condition 
thought to represent the possibility of cerebral hypoper-
fusion portending adverse outcome.21 Incidentally, and 
pertinent to the present study, the “triple low” condition 
is defined as spending any 2 or more consecutive minutes 
below an MAP of 75 mm Hg in conjunction with a bispectral 
index value considered too low (45) to be solely reflective 
of central nervous system-depressant anesthetic action of an 
end-tidal inhaled anesthetic concentration equivalent to 0.8 
minimum alveolar concentration.3 As in the present study, 
prolonged periods of time spent in the “triple low” state 
portended worse outcome, suggesting that outcome may be 
improved by limiting the amount of time a patient is permit-
ted to accrue below an MAP of 75 mm Hg.3,11 A more recent 
finding disputing such an association of duration of “triple 
low” with outcome may point to one potential weakness of 
the “triple low” concept being that it considers all MAPs 
below 75 mm Hg equally, a suggestion in stark contrast 
with findings underlying the SLUScore limits (Tables 2  
and 5).6,7
Although hypotension might theoretically be escaped 
altogether by keeping a patient’s MAP above 75 mm Hg at 
all times, this would be neither feasible in the reality of clini-
cal practice nor likely desirable. In our findings, over 90% 
of patients’ MAP dropped below 75 mm Hg at some point 
during their anesthetic (Figure 1); however, only approxi-
mately one third of patients did so long enough to exceed 
at least one of the SLUScore limits (Tables 4, 6, and 7). The 
conceivable benefit of knowing a patient’s SLUScore in real 
time might be that this might allow permissive hypoten-
sion to be instituted whenever indicated (such as to mini-
mize bleeding) while still keeping track of cumulative times 
spent in a hypotensive state and providing notification only 
to (approximate 5%) increments of risk resulting from more 
extended periods of hypotension. Patient benefit might be 
derived from not only avoiding more severe hypotension 
below an MAP of 60 mm Hg, but also minimizing extended 
periods at an MAP between 60 and 70 mm Hg, a pressure 
range traditionally considered only mildly hypotensive 
and not perceived as posing a hazard for the patient but 
as remaining well within the prevalent standard of care. 
Finally, regardless of whether or not provider knowledge 
of the SLUScore in real time may or may not demonstrate 
to help improve patient outcome,18–20 off-line calculation 
of the SLUScore after a case finishes may still allow those 
fractions of patients to be identified who appear to be at 
some significantly increased risk (because of unrecognized, 
deliberate, or insufficiently treated hypotensive exposures) 
and stratified for more selective follow-up care. This would 
apply especially to those generally healthier patients with 
elevated SLUScores who might not otherwise be deemed 
to be at much of an increased risk based on their lower 
comorbidity.
An important limitation of this study remains the fact that 
the SLUScore limits inherently incorporate, by virtue of having 
been generated by a less than completely adjusted model for all 
potential pertinent factors, including the types of procedures, 
some confounding portion of risk conceivably posed by the 
procedures themselves with which these hypotensive expo-
sures were associated (Figure 4). Thus, it is conceivable that 
the true risk progression attributable to hypotensive exposures 
might amount to less than the proposed 5% relative increase 
Figure 5. Association between the SLUScore 
time limits (see Table 5) and the magnitude of 
the decrease in mean arterial blood pressure 
(MAP) relative to 75 mm Hg. Approximately every 
5.2 mm Hg decrease in MAP caused the associ-
ated SLUScore time limits to be reduced by 50%, 
suggesting progressively decreased blood flow. 
Because the association with MAP is not linear 
but exponential, it is suggestive of a progressive 
increase in vascular resistance with hypotension. 
Given the well-known relative sparing of cardiac 
and cerebral vascular beds, hypotensive vasocon-
striction would have most likely produced splanch-
nic ischemic injury, leading to adverse outcome.17
Figure 6. Association between patients’ SLUScore and the inci-
dence of various postoperative complications as captured in Saint 
Louis University’s NSQIP database. A progressive SLUScore por-
tended an increased risk of postoperative renal failure, (deep) organ 
space infection, and septic shock, suggesting possible splanchnic 
hypoperfusion as the pathophysiologic abnormality associated with 
hypotensive exposures.17

in mortality odds per increment or to a potentially different 
value for different types of procedures. These possibilities will 
require more comprehensive model revisions, which should 
ideally account for the types of procedures and might also 
benefit from the results of the planned SLUScore trial,19 by iso-
lating the potential impact of anesthetic interventions aimed 
solely at minimizing the progression of hypotensive expo-
sures, regardless of the specific types of surgical procedures 
during which they occur.19 In due course, future SLUScore 
models might need to be revised to take into account the types 
of procedures, continually improving procedural techniques, 
as well as foreseeable anesthetic practice adjustments because 
even less than severe hypotension is being increasingly cited 
as a source of concern and potential opportunity for contribut-
ing to improved patient outcomes. E
