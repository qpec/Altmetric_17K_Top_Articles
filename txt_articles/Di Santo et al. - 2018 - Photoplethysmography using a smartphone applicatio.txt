he radial artery is used commonly for coronary angiog­
raphy, percutaneous coronary intervention and invasive 
hemodynamic monitoring. Transradial access for coron­
ary and peripheral interventions is used increasingly because of a 
lower incidence of vascular complications, patient preference and 
reduced mortality in patients with acute coronary syndrome.1–4 
Many of these benefits are attributed to superior postprocedural 
hemostasis given the superficial course and small calibre of the 
radial artery relative to the deeper and larger femoral vessel. 
However, this small calibre also renders the radial artery prone to 
occlusion if proper anticoagulation and hemostatic practices are 
not followed5,6 — a complication that is reported to occur in up to 
one­third of patients.7 Despite dual blood supply to the hand via 
the ulnar and radial arteries, rare cases of substantial limb com­
promise have been reported after catheterization of the radial 
artery.8–10 Evaluating the competency of this dual blood supply

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: Radial artery access is 
commonly performed for coronary angi­
ography and invasive hemodynamic mon­
itoring. Despite limitations in diagnostic 
accuracy, the modified Allen test (manual 
occlusion of radial and ulnar arteries fol­
lowed by release of the latter and assess­
ment of palmar blush) is used routinely to 
evaluate the collateral circulation to the 
hand and, therefore, to determine patient 
eligibility for radial artery access. We 
sought to evaluate whether a smartphone 
application may provide a superior alter­
native to the modified Allen test.
METHODS: We compared the modified 
Allen test with a smartphone heart 
rate–monitoring application (photople­
thysmography readings detected using 
a smartphone camera lens placed on 
the patient’s index finger) in patients 
undergoing a planned cardiac cathe­
terization. Test order was randomly 
assigned in a 1:1 fashion. All patients 
then underwent conventional plethys­
mography of the index finger, followed 
by Doppler ultrasonography of the 
radial and ulnar arteries (the diagnostic 
standard). The primary outcome was 
diagnostic accuracy of the heart rate–
monitoring application.
RESULTS: Among 438 patients who were 
included in the study, we found that the 
heart rate–monitoring application had a 
superior diagnostic accuracy compared 
with the modified Allen test (91.8% v. 
81.7%, p = 0.002), attributable to its 
greater specificity (93.0% v. 82.8%, p = 
0.001). We also found that this applica­
tion had greater diagnostic accuracy for 
assessment of radial or ulnar artery 
patency in the ipsilateral and contralat­
eral wrist (94.0% v. 84.0%, p < 0.001).
INTERPRETATION: A smartphone applica­
tion used at the bedside was diagnostically 
superior to traditional physical examina­
tion for confirming ulnar patency before 
radial artery access. This study highlights 
the potential for smartphone­based diag­
nostics to aid in clinical decision­making at 
the patient’s bedside. Trial registration:

remains endorsed by current interventional cardiac societies,13,14 
as well as the World Health Organization.15
Colour Doppler ultrasonography imaging is the gold standard 
method for assessing arterial patency and collateral competency 
in this setting,16 but it is relatively resource­intensive and, there­
fore, seldom feasible or cost­effective in routine clinical practice. 
Assessment at the bedside using the modified Allen test is widely 
accepted as the clinical standard. Despite this test’s known diag­
nostic and prognostic shortcomings16,17 and the low incidence of 
clinically significant ulnar artery occlusion,18 results from modi­
fied Allen tests have served to exclude as many as 27% of 
patients from transradial approaches for cardiac catheterization, 
and an abnormal modified Allen test remains a relative contra­
indication for placement of invasive hemodynamic monitoring.19 
Plethysmography, which is the measurement of changes in 
amplitude of a photoelectric signal based on changes in blood 
volume pulsations,20 and pulse oximetry (commonly referred to 
as the Barbeau test) have been described as alternatives; how­
ever, the need for a dedicated oximeter has precluded its wide­
spread use. Therefore, the modified Allen test remains the pre­
ferred method for assessment of dual circulation.11,21
Because of the widespread availability of smartphones, they 
are being used increasingly as point­of­care diagnostics in clinical 
settings with minimal or no cost. For example, built­in cameras 
with dedicated software or photodiode sensors using infrared 
light–emitting diodes have the potential to render smartphones 
into functional plethysmographs. However, robust evaluation of 
these technologies in clinical settings is lacking. We sought to 
evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of a smartphone­based heart 
rate–monitoring application compared with the modified Allen 
test for assessing dual circulation to the hand (ulnar artery 
patency) for transradial angiography.
Methods
Study design and participants
The CAPITAL iPhone­based evaluation of dual circulation before 
transRadial Access for DIagnostic Angiography triaL (CAPITAL 
iRADIAL) was a prospective randomized clinical trial (RCT) con­
ducted at the University of Ottawa Heart Institute between July 
2015 and March 2016. We recruited patients from the hospital’s 
coronary care unit, inpatient cardiology service and Regional 
Referral Centre/Day Unit if their clinical care plan included 
assessment for cardiac catheterization that included possible 
transradial access (Figure 1). Patients with a planned cardiac 
catheterization were eligible for inclusion. We excluded patients 
if hemodynamic instability was present, there was a need for 
emergent angiography (ongoing cardiac ischemia or ST­segment 
elevation myocardial infarction), the patient could not or would 
not provide informed consent or the patient had undergone pre­
vious surgical removal of the radial or ulnar artery. All partici­
pants provided written informed consent.
Randomization and masking
We randomly assigned participants 1:1 to either the modified 
Allen test or heart rate–monitoring application by using con­
cealed envelopes prepared with a computer random sequence 
generator. Either the modified Allen test or heart rate–monitoring 
application were performed as the initial assessment based on 
group allocation. Subsequently, all participants underwent 3 
additional assessments: either a modified Allen test or heart 
rate–monitoring application (whichever was not performed 
first), followed by plethysmography (Barbeau and reverse Barbeau) 
and Doppler ultrasonography of the radial and ulnar arteries. All 
assessments were conducted by the same co­investigator, and, 
therefore, blinding was not performed.
The modified Allen test was performed on all participants by 
having the patient make a fist for 30 seconds and with pressure 
applied over the radial and ulnar arteries to occlude them. The 
participant was then instructed to open the fist, and the ulnar 
artery was selectively released while the co­investigator moni­
tored for return of colour to the hand (Figure 2, supplementary 
video 1 [Appendix 1, available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/
doi:10.1503/cmaj.170432/­/DC1]). We coded the result as either 
ulnar artery patent (maximal palmar blush ≤ 5 s) or occluded 
(maximal palmar blush occurring > 5 s). This technique was then 
repeated by maintaining compression over the ulnar artery and 
releasing the compression over the radial artery (“reverse modi­
fied Allen test”) and using the same coding criteria. A 5­second 
cut­off for arterial patency was chosen because it has been 
shown to maximize diagnostic accuracy (79.6%), with a sensitivity 
of 75.8% and specificity of 81.7%.16
We conducted the smartphone­based evaluation by using the 
Instant Heart Rate application (version 4.5.0; Azumio) on an 
iPhone 4S (Apple). We selected this application because it per­
mits direct visualization of the photoplethysmography tracing on 
the screen, is commercially available free of charge on both 
Apple and Android operating systems and is the most down­
loaded heart rate–monitoring application worldwide. The appli­
cation software was initially developed for tracking heart rate in 
individuals without the need for dedicated equipment, using a 
proprietary algorithm by Azumio that was validated by compar­
ing data collected via the application to electrocardiograms. The 
software utilizes the smartphone’s camera light and lens to 
reflect light on an individual’s finger, resulting in colour and 
brightness changes that are then extracted by the camera lens 
and interpreted as changes in pulse, reflected both as a numer­
ical value (i.e., heart rate) and as a photoplethysmography 
 
tracing on the phone’s screen. 
We acquired photoplethysmography readings by placing the 
camera lens over the pulp of the participant’s index finger with 
the hand resting on a firm surface and light pressure applied over 
the back of the camera (Figure 2, supplementary video 2 [Appen­
dix 2, available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/
cmaj.170432/­/DC2]). Readings were recorded before and imme­
diately after isolated radial artery compression for 2 minutes or 
less and were divided into 4 categories as previously described 
by Barbeau and colleagues21 (i.e., A, no damping of pulse tracing 
immediately after radial artery compression; B, damping of pulse 
tracing; C, loss of pulse tracing followed by recovery of pulse 
tracing within 2 minutes; D, loss of pulse tracing without recov­
ery within 2 minutes). Readings categorized as A or B indicated

adequate flow, whereas those characterized as C or D indicated 
inadequate circulation.
We used a portable plethysmograph and pulse oximeter 
(Summit DME) for all participants after the assessments using the 
modified Allen test and heart rate–monitoring application, and 
before the assessments conducted with Doppler ultrasonog­
raphy. We classified readings from plethysmography by using the 
same criteria as for the heart rate–monitoring application. We 
performed Doppler ultrasonography by using a linear transducer 
probe at both left and right wrists (Hitachi Noblus). We used both 
short and long axis views to visualize and measure radial and 
ulnar arteries. We measured maximum lumen diameter, intimal 
thickness and colour Doppler with pulse wave velocities at 1 cm 
proximal to the styloid process of the radius.22
Outcomes
Our primary outcome was overall diagnostic accuracy (the total 
number of true positives and true negatives as a proportion of the 
entire sample size) of the heart rate–monitoring application or 
modified Allen test for assessing collateral blood supply to the 
hand. For the primary analysis, we used only the first test to which 
the patient was randomly assigned to evaluate diagnostic accu­
racy, and then we compared test accuracy between the 2 ran­
domly asssigned groups. We used the complete absence of any 
detectable Doppler flow of the ulnar artery as the reference stan­
dard for a positive modified Allen test or heart rate–monitoring 
application. We used the diagnostic accuracy of the heart rate–
monitoring application for radial or ulnar artery patency from 
both right and left wrists (irrespective of expected primary access 
site) as a secondary outcome. 
We evaluated prespecified variables to determine the predic­
tors of poor diagnostic performance for the heart rate–monitoring 
application. We also compared the diagnostic accuracy of the 
application to that of conventional plethysmography. In addition, 
we conducted a post hoc analysis to determine if a stepwise 
approach to dual circulation assessment, specifically performing

the modified Allen test followed by the use of the heart rate–
monitoring application in cases of positive modified Allen test 
results, resulted in greater diagnostic accuracy compared to the 
modified Allen test alone.
Statistical analysis
We assumed a diagnostic accuracy of 80% using the modified 
Allen test,16 and 438 participants were calculated to achieve 80% 
power to detect a 10% difference in diagnostic accuracy using 
the heart rate–monitoring application. All continuous variables 
are reported as means (standard deviation). Categorical vari­
ables are described as number (%). Comparisons between diag­
nostic arms were performed using χ2 or Fisher exact tests. Within 
arm comparisons were performed using McNemar tests when 
comparing proportions for paired data. We analyzed artery­level 
data by using generalized estimating equations. We took cluster­
ing into account for those participants who had multiple arteries 
assessed. We used logistic regression to generate the model for 
predictors of false­positive assessment. All calculations were per­
formed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute). Our research proto­
col can be found in Appendix 3 (available at www.cmaj.ca/
lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.170432/­/DC3). The study was 
registered with clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02519491).
Ethics approval
The study was approved by the Ottawa Health Science Network 
Research Ethics Board.
Results
A total of 536 patients were screened, of whom 438 were included 
(Figure 1). Patient characteristics were comparable between the 
modified Allen test and heart rate monitoring application arms 
(Table 1). Nearly half of the participants in each group had previ­
ously undergone coronary angiography or had a documented his­
tory of arterial line insertion. Medical therapy, including nitrates and 
anticoagulants, was similar between the groups. The right radial 
artery was the potential primary access site in 75.8% of participants, 
and maximal vessel and lumen diameters were similar between the 
2 groups. The median baseline lumen diameter was 2.1 (interquar­
tile range 1.8–2.5) mm, and comparable proportions of patients 
within each Barbeau class were randomly assigned to the arms.

Primary outcome: ulnar artery patency 
assessment
Absence of ulnar flow by Doppler ultrasonography 
in the homolateral limb was found in 10 partici­
pants (6 in the heart rate–monitoring application 
group and 4 in the modified Allen test group). Diag­
nostic accuracy was 10.1% higher using the heart 
rate–monitoring application compared to that with 
the modified Allen test for determining ulnar artery 
patency (91.8%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 87.3% 
to 95.1% v. 81.7%, 95% CI 76.0% to 86.6%, p = 0.002, 
Table 2). This was caused by greater specificity with 
the heart rate–monitoring application (93.0%, 
95% CI 88.7% to 96.0% v. 82.8%, 95% CI 77.1% to 
87.6%, p = 0.001). On a per­participant basis, 15 par­
ticipants (6.8%) in the heart rate–monitoring appli­
cation group and 37 (16.9%) in the modified Allen 
test group had false­positive results and would 
have been incorrectly excluded from radial artery 
access. Neither sensitivity (50.0%, 95% CI 11.8% to 
88.2% v. 25.0%, 95% CI 0.6 to 80.6, p = 0.6) nor posi­
tive predictive value differed between the heart 
rate–monitoring application and the modified Allen 
test groups (16.7%, 95% CI 3.6% to 41.4% v. 2.6%, 
95% CI 0.7% to 13.8%, p = 0.09). The negative pre­
dictive value was 98.3% (95% CI 95.2% to 99.7%) for 
the modified Allen test group compared to 98.5% 
(95% CI 95.7% to 99.7%) in the heart rate–monitoring 
application group (p = 1.0).
Dual circulation assessment in all arteries
In total, 1472 arteries were assessed using the 
modified Allen test, heart rate–monitoring applica­
tion, plethysmography and Doppler ultrasonogra­
phy in both homolateral and contralateral limbs 
(Table 3). The discriminatory power of the heart 
rate–monitoring application remained greater 
than that of the modified Allen test, with a diagnos­
tic accuracy of 94.0% (95% CI 91.9% to 95.6%) 
compared to 84.0% (95% CI 79.9% to 97.4%), 
respectively (p < 0.001). We did not observe any dif­
ferences in diagnostic performance of the modified 
Allen test or heart rate–monitoring application 
when we compared radial and ulnar assessments 
(p > 0.05).
Predictors of false-positive assessments
We included age, sex, body mass index (BMI) and 
presence of a palpable pulse as variables in the 
model. Thirty­seven participants in the modified 
Allen test cohort and 15 in the heart rate–monitoring 
application cohort had false­positive assessments. 
In the modified Allen test cohort, we found that 
age, male sex and BMI were not significant; however, the presence 
of a palpable ulnar artery significantly decreased the odds of hav­
ing a false­positive result (odds ratio [OR] 0.06, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.25). 
Similarly, for the heart rate–monitoring application cohort, the 
only significant variable in the model was the presence of a palpa­
ble pulse (OR 0.04, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.15).

Stepwise evaluation of dual circulation
We evaluated the clinical utility of sequential testing by deter­
mining the impact of the heart rate–monitoring application on 
participants who had a positive modified Allen test (i.e., palmar 
blush > 5 s). Of the patients randomly assigned to the modified 
Allen test cohort for our primary analysis, 38 (17.4%) participants 
had a positive modified Allen test and would be excluded from 
radial instrumentation. Of these participants, 36 had a subse­
quent normal heart rate–monitoring application assessment, 
thereby reclassifying these participants as having a patent ulnar 
artery. When compared with the use of the modified Allen test 
alone, this stepwise approach had a superior diagnostic accuracy 
(95.4%, 95% CI 91.8%–97.8% v. 81.7%, 95% CI 76.0%–86.6%, 
p < 0.001). This improved accuracy was caused predominantly by 
a superior specificity with the heart rate–monitoring application 
(96.7%, 95% CI 93.4%–96.7% v. 82.8%, 95% CI 77.1%–87.6%, 
p < 0.001).
Comparison of the heart rate–monitoring application 
and conventional plethysmography
To further evaluate its performance, we compared the overall 
diagnostic accuracy of the heart rate–monitoring application 
with that of conventional plethysmography. The application had 
a 94.0% accuracy compared to 93.5% with conventional plethys­
mography in all of the arteries that were assessed (p = 0.7). 
Although the heart rate–monitoring application showed superior 
accuracy relative to the modified Allen test, it was comparable to 
that of conventional plethysmography.
Adverse events
There were no procedural related complications during this 
study. Fourteen participants had an in­hospital major adverse 
cardiac event (i.e., myocardial infarction, stroke or death); 10 
were in the modified Allen test cohort (5 patients with stroke, 1 
with myocardial infarction and 4 deaths) and 4 were in the heart 
rate–monitoring application cohort (2 patients with myocardial 
infarctions and 2 deaths).
Interpretation
This proof of concept study implemented the photoplethysmo­
graphic capability widely available in smartphones for point­of­
care evaluation of arterial patency — in this instance, for the 
assessment of dual circulation before radial artery access for car­
diac catheterization or hemodynamic monitoring. We have shown 
that use of a heart rate–monitoring application has the potential 
to improve diagnostic accuracy relative to the modified Allen 
test — the widely used clinical standard. In our study, the inci­
dence of ulnar artery occlusion as assessed by Doppler ultra­
sonography was low, and the increased diagnostic discriminatory 
power of the heart rate–monitoring application was primarily 
caused by a reduction in false­positive tests. Thus, our study

shows the utility of a smartphone for point­of­care diagnostics 
with numerous clinical applications.
Mobile digital technology has been ubiquitously and rapidly 
integrated into workplaces, yet the development, evaluation and 
validation of smartphones for point­of­care diagnostics has 
lagged.23 Barriers to the acceptance of mobile health technol­
ogies among health care providers include concerns regarding 
their efficacy and safety, ease of use, risk to patient confidential­
ity and diagnostic accuracy.24 For example, a recent study high­
lighted inaccuracies in assessments of blood pressure by an 
application sold to nearly 150 000 users, by providing falsely 
reassuring blood pressure levels with hypertensive readings.25 
Although such cases warrant concern, considerable effort and 
resources are being invested in integrating diagnostics into 
smartphones for a wide array of conditions (e.g., Apple’s 
ResearchKit).26 The current report highlights that a smartphone 
application can outperform the current standard of care and pro­
vide incremental diagnostic yield in clinical practice. However, as 
with all new interventions and technologies, rigorous and sys­
tematic evaluation is needed before clinical integration.
Although not our primary goal, our study adds to the growing 
body of evidence that assessment of dual circulation by current 
standards is inadequate and may be irrelevant to the selection of 
patients for transradial access for cardiac catheterization. First, 
our findings show the low incidence of ulnar artery occlusion and 
the lack of sensitivity associated with abnormal results from the 
modified Allen test or heart rate–monitoring application. Thus, 
routine assessment will both inappropriately exclude a higher 
number of patients from the benefits of transradial access while 
simultaneously failing to identify a substantial proportion of those 
patients with inadequate ulnar reserve. Second, some studies 
have shown the presence of recruitable vascular reserve in the 
hand that can prevent clinically evident ischemia after mechanical 
manipulation of the radial artery.27,28 This concept is supported 
clearly by studies that show the safety of using the homolateral 
ulnar artery for access in patients with occluded or unavailable 
radial artery access.29,30 Finally, no substantial numbers of isch­
emic complications were reported in our study or in other RCTs 
that evaluated transradial access.2,12,31 Thus, although the practice 
of assessment of dual circulation is prevalent and rooted in the

culture of medicine and guidelines, the practice remains without a 
reasonable foundation of evidence to support its use.
Performing the modified Allen test before radial artery access is 
recommended currently by numerous medical societies — includ­
ing before transradial cardiac catheterization,13,14 acquisition of 
arterial blood gases15 and harvesting of the radial artery for coron­
ary artery bypass grafting.32 In addition, the reverse modified Allen 
test is performed commonly to assess for radial artery occlusion 
after transradial artery catheterization. Although Doppler ultra­
sonography remains the gold standard, the modified Allen test 
remains the predominant form of ulnar patency assessment 
because this test can be performed at point of care. Based on our 
results, if the modified Allen test is to be used, replacing it with a 
photoplethysmography­based assessment using a smartphone 
application has the potential to increase the number of patients 
eligible for radial artery access by 10% over standard clinical care.
Limitations
Our study has some limitations. As a proof of concept study, we 
wanted to show the utility of a smartphone to improve diagnos­
tic accuracy, but it was not designed to detect any difference in 
ischemic adverse events from transradial access. However, given 
the low prevalence of clinically meaningful outcomes in trans­
radial studies, adequately powered studies would be prohibi­
tively large. Instead, if dual circulation assessment is to be used, 
our data support the use of the heart rate–monitoring applica­
tion to achieve a higher diagnostic accuracy and specificity, 
thereby allowing clinicians to offer transradial access to a greater 
number of patients. We also used the absence of documented 
Doppler flow in the ulnar as the gold standard for inadequate 
ulnar collateral supply. In addition to static testing, methods that 
employ dynamic assessment of Doppler signals during radial 
artery compression have been described;22 however, none of 
these techniques are associated with better prognostication of 
adequate collateral flow, and thus we elected to use the most 
extreme case (i.e., absence of flow) as our standard. Further­
more, all testing was performed by the same co­investigator, 
which predisposed our study to verification bias; however, ran­
domly assigning participants to either the heart rate–monitoring 
application or the modified Allen test for the initial assessment 
and then comparing the result to our reference standard was 
important in mitigating this bias. Finally, all testing was per­
formed using an iPhone 4s smartphone and a specific version of 
the heart rate–monitoring application. Given the differences in 
software and hardware specifications, these results are not 
 
necessarily generalizable to all smartphone platforms nor to dif­
ferent photoplethysmographic applications.
Conclusion
We found that using a smartphone heart rate–monitoring appli­
cation to assess ulnar artery patency had superior diagnostic 
accuracy than the clinical standard (modified Allen test). 
Although this application is not certified at present for use in 
health care by any regulatory body, our study highlights the 
potential for smartphone­based diagnostics to aid in clinical 
decision­making at the patient’s bedside.
