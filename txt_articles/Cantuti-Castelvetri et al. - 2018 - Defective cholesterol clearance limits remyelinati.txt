Age-associated decline in regeneration capacity limits the restoration of nervous system
functionality after injury. In a model for demyelination, we found that old mice fail to
resolve the inflammatory response initiated after myelin damage. Aged phagocytes
accumulated excessive amounts of myelin debris, which triggered cholesterol crystal
formation and phagolysosomal membrane rupture and stimulated inflammasomes.
Myelin debris clearance required cholesterol transporters, including apolipoprotein
E. Stimulation of reverse cholesterol transport was sufficient to restore the capacity
of old mice to remyelinate lesioned tissue. Thus, cholesterol-rich myelin debris can
overwhelm the efflux capacity of phagocytes, resulting in a phase transition of
cholesterol into crystals and thereby inducing a maladaptive immune response that
impedes tissue regeneration.
R
emyelination restores rapid transmission
of nerve impulses and axonal function in
the central nervous system (CNS) of pa-
tients with demyelinating diseases such as
multiple sclerosis (MS). Although remyeli-
nation can occur in MS, age-associated decline in
myelin repair contributes to chronic progressive
disease and disability (1). Thus, understanding
the cause of and preventing this decline are key
goals in regenerative medicine (2–4). So far, ep-
igenetic changes within aging oligodendrocyte
progenitor cells and declines in phagocytic ca-
pacity of aged blood-derived monocytes have
been identified as possible mechanisms (5, 6).
We implemented a toxin-induced model, in which
a single injection of lysolecithin (lysophosphati-
dylcholine) induces a focal demyelinating lesion
in the white matter of the brain or spinal cord of
mice. In lesioned animals, demyelination is com-
plete within 4 days, followed by a repair process
that is maximal between 14 and 21 days post-
injection (dpi) and requires rapid clearance of
damaged myelin for regeneration to occur (7).
We induced focal demyelinating lesions in the
corpus callosum of young (3 months) and old
(12months)miceby lysolecithininjections. Lesions
were of similar size at 4 dpi but not at 14 dpi,
confirming the poor regenerative capacity of
old mice (Fig. 1, A to C, and fig. S1, A to E). Sus-
tained immune infiltration, as determined by
IBA1-positive and MAC2-positive cells, was de-
tected in old mice at 14 dpi (Fig. 1, A and E, and
fig. S1G). Myelin debris accumulation within
lysosomes of phagocytes (Fig. 1, D and F) and
numerous foam cells harboring lipid droplets
and needle-shaped cholesterol crystals—a typical
hallmark of cholesterol overloading—were found
in old mice (Fig. 1, G and H, and fig. S2G). More-
over, by a combination of laser reflection and
fluorescence confocal microscopy (reflection mi-
croscopy) we confirmed the increase of crystal
deposition in spinal cord lesions of old mice
(Fig. 1, I and J). Crystals were similarly observed
in two other models of myelin injury (fig. S2).
Toxic overload of cholesterol drives the forma-
tion of foamy macrophages and maladaptive
immune responses in atherosclerosis. We hypoth-
esized that the accumulation of cholesterol, the
major component of myelin, may overwhelm the
cholesterol transport capacity of phagocytes,
thereby forming a bottleneck for successful re-
pair in the aged CNS. Because cholesterol cannot
be broken down, it must be transferred from the
phagocytes back to the extracellular space via
the transporters ABCA1 and ABCG1 [adenosine
triphosphate–binding cassette (ABC) A1 and G1]
in the plasma membrane where it binds high-
density lipoprotein particles [e.g., apolipoprotein E
(APOE)] (8). Real-time quantitative reverse tran-
scription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analy-
ses revealed that the expression of ApoE, Abca1,
and Abcg1 was reduced in 4-dpi lesions of old mice
compared with young mice (Fig. 1, K to M, and
fig. S3). Oxysterols (hydroxylated cholesterol me-
tabolites) such as 24S- and 27-hydroxycholesterol
are endogenous ligands for the liver X receptor
(LXR), therebycontrollingthe expression of genes
involved in cholesterol efflux in cholesterol-loaded
cells(9).Relativeamountsof24S-hydroxycholesterol
did not differ in lesions of young and old animals,
but 27-hydroxycholesterol levels were reduced in
lesions of old mice (fig. S3). One possible explana-
tion for lesion restitution failure in old mice is the
inability to clear excessive myelin-derived choles-
terol from phagocytes. Thus, weexaminedwhether
the LXR agonist GW3965 (10) improve lesion
recovery in old mice by inducing the expression
of genes involved in lipid efflux, such as Abca1,
Abcg1, and ApoE (fig. S3). GW3965 led to mark-
edly improved lesion regeneration in old mice,
with a reduction in the number of IBA1-positive
and MAC2-positive phagocytes (Fig. 1, A to C). In
addition, the number of phagocytes containing
myelin debris, the number of foam cells, and the
amount of cholesterol crystals were reduced by
treatment with GW3965 (Fig. 1, A to J).
Because accumulation of cholesterol in phago-
cytes may pose a barrier for successful tissue re-
generation, we analyzed the regenerative capacity
of mouse mutants lacking central factors of the
reverse cholesterol transport pathway. We in-
duced demyelinating lesions in 3-month-old
NR1H3 (or LXRa) knockout (KO) mice and ob-
served, as in aged wild-type (WT) mice, impaired
lesion restitution and sustained phagocyte infil-
tration at 21 dpi (fig. S4, A to C). In addition, we
detected accumulation of myelin debris in lyso-
somes of phagocytes and crystal deposition in
lesions of LXRa KO mice (fig. S4, D to G).
Next, we analyzed the role of APOE, the major
CNS cholesterol carrier that supports lipid efflux
from cells (11). We induced focal demyelination
in the corpus callosum of 12-week-old APOE KO
and WT control mice and quantified lesion size
and recovery. Lesion size did not differ initially,
at 4 dpi (fig. S4, H to J). However, when lesions
were analyzed at 21 dpi, we observed impaired
lesion restitution. We detected increased numbers
of IBA1-positive, MAC2-positive, and major histo-
compatibility complex class II (MHC II)–positive
phagocytes, as well as enhanced crystal deposition
and myelin debris accumulation within lysosomes
of phagocytes in spinal cord and corpus callosum
lesions of APOE KO animals as compared with
control mice (Fig. 2 and fig. S5). Because APOE
has functions beyond cholesterol transport (11),
we tested the efficacy of cyclic oligosaccharide
2-hydroxypropyl-b-cyclodextrin (HbCD), a com-
pound that increases cholesterol efflux and sol-
ubility (12), and found that HbCD treatment
attenuated the phenotype of APOE KO animals
(Fig. 3 and fig. S6).
Together with Abca1 and Abcg1, ApoE repre-
sents one of the major nuclear LXR–regulated
genes involved in mediatingcholesterol efflux from
phagocytes. We thus crossbred CX3CR1CreER
animals with Abca1fl/fl and Abcg1fl/fl mice to ob-
tain microglia- and macrophage-specific double-
KO mice (ABCA1 and ABCG1 KO). We observed

II–positive phagocytes, an increase in crystal
deposition, and fewer myelinated axons in 21-dpi
lesions of ABCA1 and ABCG1 KO animals as com-
pared with controls (fig. S7).
Because excessive cholesterol accumulation
in phagocytes limits lesion recovery, we turned
to cell culture experiments to determine the
mechanisms involved. We prepared phagocytes
[primary microglia or bone marrow–derived mac-
rophages (BMDMs)] from APOE KO and WT
mice and examined the phagocytic uptake of
myelin debris, which did not differ in cells
prepared from WT or APOE KO mice (fig. S8, A
and B). Because APOE is also produced by as-
trocytes, we incubated cells in the presence of
serum-free conditioned media prepared from
either WT or APOE KO astrocytes and observed
the clearance of the internalized myelin particles
from phagocytes. Myelin debris persisted within
lysosomes of APOE KO cells that were incubated
with conditioned media from APOE KO astro-
cytes. Clearance could be improved by an APOE-
derived mimetic peptide, ATI5261 (13), which
contains an amphipathic a-helical motif responsi-
ble for lipid binding and cholesterol efflux (Fig. 3,
E and F). Moreover, myelin debris treatment

 resulted in crystal formation, which was in-
creased in APOE KO macrophages and reduced
by GW3965 treatment (fig. S8, C to G).
In atherosclerosis, cholesterol crystals can
induce inflammation by phagolysosomal mem-
brane rupture and subsequent stimulation of the
caspase-1–activating NLRP3 (NALP3 or cryopyrin)
inflammasome and secretion of interleukin
(IL)–1 cytokines (14, 15). Myelin debris treatment
resulted in lysosomal permeabilization and
caspase-1 cleavage in WT but not in NLRP3-
deficient macrophages (Fig. 4, A to H, and fig. S9,
A and B). More pronounced caspase-1 activation
was observed in APOE KO as compared with WT
macrophages, which was confirmed in vivo in
APOE KO mice after lysolecithin injection (Fig.
4E and fig. S9C). Myelin overloading induced cell
death, which resulted in DNA fragmentation
[detected by TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase–mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate
nick end labeling) assay], was cholesterol de-
pendent (fig. S9, D and E), and was rescued by
caspase-1 inhibitors, pointing to an inflammasome-
mediated pyroptotic cell death pathway (Fig. 4G
and fig. S10). Thus, cholesterol derived from
myelin debris can activate the NLRP3 inflamma-
some in macrophages when toxic levels build up
intracellularly in the absence of sufficient lipo-
protein carriers.
Because jamming the lysosomal system with
myelin debris resulted in cholesterol crystalliza-
tion and inflammasome activation, we asked
whether this pathway was responsible for
limiting regeneration in old mice. To examine
whether increased inflammasome activation
contributed to the poor recovery of old mice, we

 analyzed spinal cord lesions of aged WT and
NLRP3-deficient mice. As in GW3965-treated
old animals (Fig. 4, I and J), we found signifi-
cantly improved remyelination in aged NLRP3-
deficient mice as compared with aged WT mice
at 21 dpi. Thus, inflammasome activation, pos-
sibly downstream of cholesterol accumulation,
drives a maladaptive immune response that
hampers inflammation resolution and repair
in aged mice.
Self-resolving inflammation is essential for a
proper restorative process after tissue damage,
whereas uncontrolled inflammation can leave
lasting marks that permanently alter tissue
homeostasis (16). We made the surprising discov-
ery that the self-limiting inflammatory response,
which is necessary to initiate a regenerative pro-
cess, is maladaptive in the CNS of aged mice. It
appears that the inability of aged phagocytes to
clear the enormous amounts of cholesterol that
are released from myelin after myelin breakdown
in demyelinating diseases results in a phase tran-
sition of free cholesterol into crystals, inducing
lysosomal rupture and inflammasome stimula-
tion, consistent with the beneficial effects of
nuclear receptor agonists in remyelination (17, 18).
The unexpected link between lipid metabolisms
and tissue regeneration provides opportunities
for the development of regenerative medicines
for remyelination and for improving functional
recovery after CNS injury (19).
