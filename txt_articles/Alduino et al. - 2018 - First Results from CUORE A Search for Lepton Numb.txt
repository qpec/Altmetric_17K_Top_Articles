(Dated: February 23, 2018)
The CUORE experiment, a ton-scale cryogenic bolometer array, recently began operation at the
Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso in Italy. The array represents a significant advancement in
this technology, and in this work we apply it for the first time to a high-sensitivity search for a
lepton-number–violating process:
130Te neutrinoless double-beta decay. Examining a total TeO2
exposure of 86.3 kg·yr, characterized by an effective energy resolution of (7.7±0.5) keV FWHM and
a background in the region of interest of (0.014 ± 0.002) counts/(keV·kg·yr), we find no evidence for
neutrinoless double-beta decay. Including systematic uncertainties, we place a lower limit on the
decay half-life of T 0ν
1/2(130Te) > 1.3 × 1025 yr (90% C.L.); the median statistical sensitivity of this
search is 7.0 × 1024 yr. Combining this result with those of two earlier experiments, Cuoricino and
CUORE-0, we find T 0ν
1/2(130Te) > 1.5 × 1025 yr (90% C.L.), which is the most stringent limit to date
on this decay. Interpreting this result as a limit on the effective Majorana neutrino mass, we find
mββ < (110 − 520) meV, where the range reflects the nuclear matrix element estimates employed.
The existence of nonzero neutrino masses is well es-
tablished by precision measurements of neutrino flavor
oscillation [1]. This discovery has given renewed impetus
to long-standing questions as to the Dirac or Majorana
nature of the neutrino [2], the role of Majorana neutri-
nos in cosmological evolution [3], and the absolute neu-
trino mass. Neutrinoless double-beta (0νββ) decay is a
lepton-number–violating process that can occur only if
neutrinos are Majorana fermions [4–7]. The discovery of
this decay would unambiguously demonstrate that lepton
number is not a symmetry of nature and that neutrinos
are Majorana particles [8].
If it occurs, 0νββ decay has a robust experimental sig-
nature: a peak in the summed energy spectrum of the
final state electrons at the Q-value of the decay (Qββ).
To maximize sensitivity to this signature, an experiment
must have a low background rate near Qββ, good energy
resolution, and a large source mass. The Cryogenic Un-
derground Observatory for Rare Events (CUORE) [9] is a
new detector that applies the powerful macro-bolometer
technique [10, 11] at an unprecedented scale to search
for 0νββ decay of tellurium isotopes. In this work, we
focus on 0νββ decay of 130Te to the ground state of
130Xe.
Our sensitivity benefits from the high natural
abundance of 130Te, (34.167 ± 0.002)% [12], and large
Qββ of (2527.515 ± 0.013) keV [13–15].
CUORE is composed of 988 5 × 5 × 5 cm3 TeO2 crys-
tals [16], each having a mass of 750 g, which we can
cool to temperatures as low as 7 mK. When a crystal
absorbs energy, we exploit the resulting temperature in-
crease to measure that energy.
Each crystal is instru-
mented with a thermistor [17] to record thermal pulses,
and a heater [18, 19] for thermal gain stabilization.
The crystals are arranged into 19 copper-framed tow-
ers, with each tower consisting of 13 floors of 4 crys-
tals. The crystals are held in the tower frame by poly-
tetrafluoroethylene supports.
The towers are arranged
in a close-packed array and thermally connected to the
mixing chamber of a 3He/4He dilution refrigerator[20],
which is precooled by five two-stage (∼40 K and ∼4 K)
pulse tube cryocoolers [21] and a Joule-Thomson expan-
sion valve.
To suppress external γ-ray backgrounds, two lead
shields are integrated into the cryogenic volume: a 30-cm
thick shield at ∼50 mK above the detectors and a 6-cm
thick shield at ∼4 K around and below the detectors.
The lateral and lower shields are made from ancient Ro-
man lead with extremely low levels of radioactivity [22].
An external lead shield (25 cm thick) surrounded by bo-
rated polyethylene and boric acid (20 cm thick) provide
additional shielding. More details on the experimental
subsystems and shielding can be found in Refs. [23–27].
A prototype detector equivalent to a single CUORE
tower, CUORE-0, operated at Laboratori Nazionali del
 3
Gran Sasso from 2013 to 2015 and served to validate
the materials and low-background assembly techniques
used for CUORE [16, 28–31]. Before the current work,
the strongest probe of ββ decay of 130Te came from
CUORE-0 [32–35].
The data presented here are from two month-long
datasets collected from May to June (Dataset 1) and Au-
gust to September (Dataset 2) of 2017. Between the two
datasets, we improved the detector operating conditions;
in particular, we implemented an active noise cancella-
tion system on the cryocoolers [36] and improved the elec-
trical grounding of the experiment. The detector operat-
ing temperature is a compromise between minimizing the
heat capacity of the crystals, thus maximizing the ther-
mal gain, and optimizing the signal bandwidth. To select
the optimal operating temperature, we performed a tem-
perature scan to study the energy resolution achieved by
a representative subset of detectors. An operating tem-
perature of approximately 15 mK was selected for both
datasets.
Each dataset is bookended by periods devoted to en-
ergy calibration with 232Th γ-ray sources [37]; the clos-
ing calibration is performed to verify the stability of the
detector response over the dataset. We use the data col-
lected between calibrations, which we refer to as physics
data, for our 0νββ decay search.
The voltage across each thermistor is amplified and fil-
tered [26, 38–40] and continuously digitized with a sam-
pling rate of 1 kHz [41–43]. A total of 984 of 988 chan-
nels are functioning. Thermal event pulses are identified
by a software derivative trigger with channel-dependent
thresholds ranging from 20 to a few hundred keV; we an-
ticipate reducing these thresholds for future low-energy
studies [44, 45]. The rise and fall times of thermal pulses
are on the order of 100 ms and 400 ms, respectively. We
analyze a 10-s window consisting of 3 s before and 7 s
after each trigger.
The pre-trigger voltage provides a
proxy for the bolometer temperature before the event,
while we determine the event energy from the pulse am-
plitude. The average event rate per detector is ∼50 mHz
in calibration data and ∼6 mHz in physics data. In ad-
dition to triggered pulses, every few minutes each heater
is injected with a stable voltage pulse (∼1 ppm absolute
stability) [46] to generate tagged reference events with
fixed thermal energy. To monitor and characterize noise
we also analyze waveforms with no discernible thermal
pulses.
To improve the signal-to-noise ratio we use an optimal
filter [47], which exploits the distinct frequency charac-
teristics of particle-induced and noise waveforms.
The
pulse amplitude is determined from the maximum value
attained by the filtered waveform. To monitor and cor-
rect for possible drifts in the energy-to-amplitude re-
sponse of the detection chain (e.g., due to small drifts
in operating temperature), which could otherwise spoil
the energy resolution, we apply thermal gain stabiliza-

tion (TGS) to each event amplitude.
We apply one
of two methods:
the first uses monoenergetic heater
pulses (heater-TGS), and the second uses pulses in-
duced by γ rays from the 2615-keV 208Tl calibration line
(calibration-TGS). Both methods were developed and
used in CUORE-0 [33]. Heater-TGS is our default al-
gorithm, while we use calibration-TGS for the ∼3% of
bolometers without functioning heaters and for channels
in which calibration-TGS yields a statistically significant
improvement in sensitivity compared to heater-TGS. In
total, 96.6% of our exposure utilizes heater-TGS while
the remainder uses calibration-TGS.
To calibrate the detectors, we use six γ lines from
the
232Th calibration sources ranging from 239 keV
to 2615 keV. We estimate the mean stabilized ampli-
tude of each line and create a calibration function for
each bolometer in each dataset (each bolometer–dataset),
which maps stabilized pulse amplitudes to physical en-
ergies.
We find that the calibration functions of each
bolometer–dataset are well described by a second-order
polynomial with zero constant term throughout the cal-
ibrated energy range. After calibrating, to blind the re-
gion near Qββ, we take events that reconstruct within
20 keV of the 2615 208Tl line in physics data and move
a blinded fraction of them down by 87 keV; this proce-
dure produces an artificial peak at Qββ [33] and is later
reversed once the 0νββ search analysis is finalized. The
calibration and unblinded physics spectra are shown in
Figure 1.
To select 0νββ decay candidates in the physics data,
we apply the following selection criteria. Firstly, we dis-
card periods of noisy data caused, for example, by ac-
tivity in the laboratory. This reduces the exposure by
1%. Next, we impose basic pulse quality requirements
 4
to each event, requiring a single pulse-like feature in the
event window and a stable pre-trigger voltage. We then
require the shape of each waveform to be consistent with
that of a true signal-like event. We build a signal-like
event sample in physics data from events that reconstruct
within 10 keV of the γ lines from 40K at 1461 keV and
60Co at 1173 keV and 1332 keV. We characterize event
waveforms with six pulse-shape parameters and repre-
sent each event with a point in this 6-dimensional space.
We calculate the Mahalanobis distance DM [48] for each
event from the mean position of the signal sample. We
choose the upper limit on DM that maximizes the discov-
ery sensitivity [49]. Throughout this optimization, data
from the region of interest for 0νββ decay (ROI) are not
used. In calculating the figure of merit for a given DM
cutoff, we estimate the signal selection efficiency from
40K events near 1461 keV and the background selection
efficiency from events with energy between 2700 − 3900
keV. Events in this latter energy range are dominated by
partially contained alpha particles and are representative
of the dominant background in the ROI. Once the opti-
mal DM cutoff is chosen, we evaluate the efficiency of the
pulse shape selection using events belonging to the 208Tl
2615-keV line.
To reduce backgrounds from decays depositing energy
in multiple crystals (e.g., α particles on crystal surfaces
or multiple Compton scatters of γ rays), we reject events
that occur within 10 ms of an event in a different bolome-
ter (anti-coincidence selection). The width of the coin-
cidence window is chosen after correcting for differences
in detector rise times and trigger configurations that can
affect the timestamp assigned to an event.
The inter-
bolometer timestamp differences are determined using
physically coincident multi-detector events, such as pair-
production events occurring in calibration data.
The
energy threshold for coincident events in the current
analysis is set to 150 keV. The anti-coincidence selec-
tion efficiency has two components: the probability for a
0νββ decay to be fully contained in a single crystal and
the probability to not accidentally coincide with another
event. We estimate the former from simulation [50, 51]
and the latter we determine using the 1461-keV γ ray
from 40K electron capture, which is a single-event decay
that is not expected to produce physical coincidences.
We evaluate the trigger efficiency as the fraction of
tagged heater pulses that produce an event trigger. The
heater pulse amplitude is scanned to study the energy
dependence of the trigger efficiency.
We also exploit
heater events to measure the basic pulse quality selec-
tion efficiency mentioned above and the energy recon-
struction efficiency (i.e., the probability that a monoen-
ergetic pulse reconstructs correctly). The combined trig-
ger, basic pulse quality, and reconstruction efficiency, de-
noted by base efficiency, is averaged over all channels
with functioning heaters and applied to all channels. In
cases where a step in the event reconstruction procedure

We establish the detector response to a monoenergetic
event near Qββ using the high-statistics 208Tl 2615-keV
γ line from calibration data. The CUORE detectors ex-
hibit a slightly non-Gaussian line shape, as was observed
in CUORE-0 [33] and Cuoricino [52, 53]. The origin of
this structure is under investigation; however, we model
it empirically with a primary Gaussian component cen-
tered at 2615 keV and two additional Gaussian compo-
nents, one on the right and one on the left of the main
peak. We find this model provides a better description of
the data compared to other models considered, for exam-
ple, a single- or double-Gaussian photopeak. The choice
of line shape is treated as a systematic uncertainty. The
three Gaussian components are parametrized with the
same bolometer–dataset dependent width. The normal-
ized line shape function of each bolometer-dataset thus
has 6 parameters: the means of the main peak and two
subpeaks, the relative intensities of the subpeaks, and
the common peak width.
We estimate the line shape
parameters for each bolometer–dataset with a simulta-
neous, unbinned extended maximum likelihood (UEML)
fit performed on each tower in the energy range 2530–
2720 keV. The simultaneous fit over a tower helps con-
strain common nuisance parameters such as relative in-
tensity of x-ray escape peaks and continuum background.
A simultaneous fit over the full array was not performed
due to the computational demands. A comparison of the
fit results with the calibration data and a breakdown of
the fit model are shown in Figure 2.
To characterize possible differences in the detector
response between physics and calibration data we fit

prominent background peaks in the physics data, with
known energies between 800 and 2615 keV, using the
best-fit line shape parameters determined above for each
bolometer–dataset.
At each energy this fit includes a
dataset-dependent (i.e., channel independent) energy off-
set variable to parametrize energy misreconstruction.
In addition, as the calibration line shape study was
performed near 2615 keV, each fit includes a dataset-
dependent(channel independent) energy resolution scal-
ing variable to parameterize energy dependence of the
resolution or a difference between background and cali-
bration resolution. We find the energy misreconstruction
is less than 0.5 keV over the calibrated energy range.
The best-fit resolution scaling parameters at 2615 keV
are 0.95 ± 0.07 and 1.01 ± 0.06 for the first and second
dataset, respectively. To parametrize the energy depen-
dence of the resolution scaling, we fit the set of scal-
ing parameters determined at each peak energy studied
with a quadratic function. The resulting best-fit function
is then used to estimate the resolution scaling at Qββ.

of the detectors (denoted effective resolution) in physics
data, extrapolated to Qββ, is given for each dataset in
Table I; to quote a single characteristic energy resolu-
tion for our entire exposure, we combine these, finding
(7.7 ± 0.5) keV FWHM.

FIG. 3.
Bottom: Best-fit model from the UEML fit (solid
blue line) overlaid on the spectrum of 0νββ decay candidates
observed in CUORE. The peak near 2506 keV is attributed
to 60Co [33]. The normalized residuals of this model and the
binned data are shown in the top panel. The dashed (blue)
curve shows the best-fit for a model with no 0νββ decay com-
ponent. The vertical band is centered at Qββ; the width of the
band reflects the systematic uncertainty on the reconstructed
energy.
Before unblinding the physics data, we fix the model
and fitting strategy to search for the 0νββ decay of 130Te.
The ROI is taken from 2465 keV to 2575 keV. The model
for each bolometer–dataset is composed of a 0νββ decay
peak, a peak for 60Co coincident γ rays, and a flat back-
ground. Each peak is modeled using the line shape dis-
cussed above, with the line width scaled by the resolution
scaling extrapolated to the peak energy. All detectors are
constrained to have the same 0νββ decay rate Γ0ν, which
we allow to vary freely in the fit; the position of the 0νββ
decay peak is fixed to Qββ for each bolometer-dataset.
The 60Co peak position is a dataset-dependent free pa-
rameter; the 60Co rate is a single free parameter but the
known isotope half-life is used to account for its decay.
The background rate is a dataset-dependent free param-
eter and is not scaled by the event selection efficiency.
Figure 3 shows the 155 candidate events in the ROI
that pass all selection criteria together with the result of
the UEML fit described above. The total TeO2 expo-
sure is 86.3 kg·yr, corresponding 24.0 kg·yr for 130Te.
The best-fit Γ0ν is (−1.0 +0.4
−0.3 (stat.) ± 0.1 (syst.)) ×
10−25 yr−1.With zero signal, the best-fit background
in the ROI averaged over both datasets is (0.014 ±
0.002) counts/(keV·kg·yr).
To evaluate the goodness of fit, we prepare a large set of
pseudo-experiments, each with a number of events deter-
mined by a Poisson distribution with a mean of 155 and
energy distributed according to the best-fit zero-signal
model. Repeating our 0νββ decay search fit on each of
these, we find that 68% yield a negative log likelihood
(NLL) larger than that obtained with our data.

We conclude there is no evidence for 0νββ decay and
set a 90% confidence Bayesian upper limit on the rate,
finding Γ0ν < 0.50 × 10−25 yr−1 (stat. only) or T 0ν
1/2 >
1.4 × 1025 yr. In constructing the posterior pdf for Γ0ν,
we approximate the marginalized likelihood with the pro-
file likelihood and use a flat prior for Γ0ν >= 0. This ap-
proximation speeds up the computation and is valid when
the marginalization is dominated by the most probable
values of the nuisance parameters. We expect this for
our likelihood as the number of events is large and the
background dominates. To confirm this we perform an
independent analysis using the BAT toolkit [54] with the
same prior but marginalize over the nuisance parameters.
The results agree with those above to the percent level.
We repeat our analysis on a large set of pseudo-
experiments generated in the same way as for the good-
ness of fit study.
We find the median 90% confidence
lower limit (sensitivity) for T 0ν
1/2 is 7.0 × 1024 yr, and
there is a 2% probability of obtaining a more stringent
limit than the one obtained with our data.
We estimate the systematic uncertainties following the
same procedure used for CUORE-0 [33].
We perform
a large number of pseudo-experiments with zero and
nonzero signals assuming different detector line shape
models and background shapes (flat and first-order poly-
nomial), varying the energy resolution scaling parameters
within their uncertainty, and shifting the position of Qββ
by ±0.5 keV to account for the energy reconstruction un-
certainty. The results are summarized in Table II. We
find the fit bias on Γ0ν to be negligible. Including these
systematic uncertainties, the 90% confidence limits are
Γ0ν < 0.52 × 10−25 yr−1 and T 0ν
1/2 > 1.3 × 1025 yr. A
frequentist analysis [55] yields T 0ν
1/2 > 2.1 × 1025 yr at
90% C.L. with a median 90% C.L. lower limit sensitivity
for T 0ν
1/2 of 7.6 × 1024 yr.
We combine our profile likelihood curve with those
from 9.8 kg·yr of 130Te exposure from CUORE-0 [32] and
19.8 kg·yr from Cuoricino [56] (see Figure 4). The com-
bined 90% C.L. limits are Γ0ν < 0.47 × 10−25 yr−1 and
T 0ν
1/2 > 1.5 × 1025 yr.
The frequentist technique yields
Γ0ν < 0.31 × 10−25 yr−1 and T 0ν
1/2 > 2.2 × 1025 yr.

1/2 > 1.5 × 1025 yr, as a limit on the effective Majorana
neutrino mass (mββ) in the framework of models of 0νββ
decay mediated by light Majorana neutrino exchange.
We use phase-space factors from [57], nuclear matrix
elements from a broad range of models [58–68], and
assume the axial coupling constant gA � 1.27; this yields
mββ < (110 − 520) meV at 90% C.L., depending on the
nuclear matrix element estimate employed.
In summary, we find no evidence for 0νββ decay of
130Te and place the most stringent limit to date on
this decay half-life. The observed background, (0.014 ±
0.002) counts/(keV·kg·yr), is in line with our expecta-
tions [51]. The characteristic energy resolution at Qββ is
(7.7 ± 0.5) keV, which we foresee improving to ∼5 keV
by optimizing operating conditions and through analysis
improvements.
A study of our future sensitivity for a
number of scenarios is presented in Ref. [69]. The exper-
imental progress in 0νββ decay searches has been dra-
matic in recent years; half-lives greater than 1025 yr are
now probed by several experiments [70–73]. CUORE is
the first ton-scale cryogenic detector array in operation,
more than an order of magnitude larger than its prede-
cessors. The successful commissioning and operation of
this large-mass, low-background, cryogenic bolometer ar-
ray represents a major advancement in the application of
this technique to 0νββ decay searches.
The CUORE Collaboration thanks the directors and
staff of the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso and our
technical staff for their valuable contribution to building
and operating the detector. We thank Danielle Speller
