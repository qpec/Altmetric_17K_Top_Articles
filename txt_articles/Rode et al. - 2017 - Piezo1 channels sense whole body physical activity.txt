Mammalian biology adapts to physical activity but the molecular mechanisms sensing the
activity remain enigmatic. Recent studies have revealed how Piezo1 protein senses
mechanical force to enable vascular development. Here, we address Piezo1 in adult endo-
thelium, the major control site in physical activity. Mice without endothelial Piezo1 lack
obvious phenotype but close inspection reveals a specific effect on endothelium-dependent
relaxation in mesenteric resistance artery. Strikingly, the Piezo1 is required for elevated blood
pressure during whole body physical activity but not blood pressure during inactivity. Piezo1
is responsible for flow-sensitive non-inactivating non-selective cationic channels which
depolarize the membrane potential. As fluid flow increases, depolarization increases to
activate voltage-gated Ca2+ channels in the adjacent vascular smooth muscle cells, causing
vasoconstriction. Physical performance is compromised in mice which lack endothelial Piezo1
and there is weight loss after sustained activity. The data suggest that Piezo1 channels sense
physical activity to advantageously reset vascular control.

 T
he health value of exercise has been described since the
time of Hippocrates, but it was not until 1953 that it was
demonstrated scientifically1. It is now known that whole
body physical activity and other forms of physical exercise afford
major protection against chronic disease2, 3. Such protection
seems likely to have evolved because animals survived by tuning
their biology to regular physical activity to avoid predators and
source prey and other food. Without this activity many humans
today are in suboptimal environments, increasing the risk of
dysregulation and disease. Therefore there has been intense
research into exercise2. However, the existence and identity of
molecular sensors of exercise has remained unclear. If we could
identify such sensors, we might find ways to better tune human
biology to advanced societies. Because the likely site of exercise
sensors is the endothelium2, we were interested in whether Piezo1
might act as an exercise sensor. Piezo1 is a relatively recently
discovered membrane protein which assembles as a trimer to
form Ca2+-permeable non-selective cationic channels activated by
physical force4–6. It is highly expressed in endothelial cells and
known to be important for integrating vascular architecture with
physical force during embryonic development7, 8.
In this study, we conditionally disrupted Piezo1 in the endo-
thelium to investigate its relevance to adult mice. We found that
elevated blood pressure of whole body physical exercise depended
on endothelial Piezo1. The mechanism was a vascular bed-
specific effect of Piezo1 which opposed endothelium-dependent
relaxation mediated by endothelium-derived hyperpolarization
(factor) (EDH(F)) to cause vasoconstriction when fluid flow was
elevated. We conclude that endothelial Piezo1 is an exercise
sensor which enables optimized redistribution of blood flow to
enhance physical performance.
Results
Mice with disrupted endothelial Piezo1 are superficially normal.
To investigate the relevance of Piezo1 in the adult endothelium,
we engineered mice with conditional Cre-Lox-mediated disrup-
tion of Piezo1 in the endothelium (Piezo1ΔEC mice) (Supple-
mentary Figs. 1 and 2). The mice appeared normal and had
normal body weights, weight gains and organ weights and serum
urea, K+ and Na+; gross anatomies and functions of the heart and
aorta were also normal (Fig. 1a–m) (Supplementary Fig. 3).
Retinal vasculature and endothelial response to injury were
normal (Fig. 1n–q). Therefore endothelial Piezo1 in the adult
appeared to be without consequence.
To investigate the mice in more detail, we made isometric
tension recordings from second-order mesenteric arteries, look-
ing for relevance of Piezo1 to endothelium-dependent tone. As
expected, arteries from control genotype mice contracted in
response to the α1-adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine and then
relaxed in response to the endothelium-dependent vasodilator
acetylcholine (Fig. 2a, b). Arteries from Piezo1ΔEC mice behaved
similarly (Fig. 2c, d). These data also suggested that endothelial
Piezo1 in the adult was of no consequence.
Endothelial Piezo1 channels have an anti-EDH(F) effect. The
Ca2+-permeable non-selective cationic pathway generated by
Piezo1 channels4–6 poses an intriguing dichotomy for endothelial
biology (Fig. 2e). Ca2+ entry theoretically drives Ca2+ dependent
mechanisms such as activation of endothelial nitric oxide
synthase7, 9. But cation entry as a whole (and especially entry of
the monovalent ion Na+) theoretically drives membrane potential
depolarization which could be important as a vasoconstrictor
mechanism because EDH(F) is well established as a mechanism
for
endothelium-dependent
vasodilatation10.
Therefore,
we
investigated the effect of inhibiting EDH(F) by the established
method of combining apamin and charybdotoxin; toxin inhibi-
tors of two K+ channels which are critical for EDH(F)10. In
mesenteric arteries from control genotype mice the toxins caused
slight inhibition of the ACh response but they strongly inhibited
the ACh response in arteries from Piezo1ΔEC mice (Fig. 2f–i).
Other properties of the arteries were unchanged by Piezo1ΔEC
(Supplementary Figs. 4, 5). The data suggest that endothelial
Piezo1 channels oppose EDH(F) and may have specific roles
under certain circumstances.
Importance for elevated blood pressure in exercise. Because of
the relevance of mesenteric arteries to peripheral resistance and
thus blood pressure, we inserted telemetry probes for continuous
recording of blood pressure. Mice were provided with free access
to a running wheel. Blood pressure was not different in Piezo1ΔEC
mice during periods of physical inactivity (Fig. 3a). In contrast,
the increase in blood pressure seen during physical activity was
reduced (Fig. 3b). The data suggest that endothelial Piezo1 has
specific importance in blood pressure regulation during whole
body physical activity.
Constitutive and flow-induced Piezo1 in mesenteric artery.
To investigate how Piezo1 might mediate an anti-EDH(F)
effect and elevation of blood pressure, we first developed a
unidirectional monovalent cation flux assay for Piezo1 channels
which showed strong monovalent cation permeability when the
channels were over-expressed in HEK293 cells or natively
expressed in cultured endothelial cells (Supplementary Fig. 6).
Constitutive monovalent cation flux was evident, suggesting
non-inactivating Piezo1 channels capable of mediating sustained
depolarization (Supplementary Fig. 6).
To determine the relevance to physiological cells, we acutely
isolated endothelial cells from second-order mesenteric arteries.
Cell-detached outside-out membrane patches were used to enable
identification of Piezo1 channels by their unitary current size
(and therefore unitary conductance) and avoid contaminating
effects from the cytosol and intracellular organelles. Outside-out
patches are outwardly convex11 and so the patch pipette did not
protect the membrane from fluid flow. Dominant constitutive
channel activity was observed with the expected 25 pS unitary
conductance of Piezo1 channels (Fig. 4a, b)4, 5. Fluid flow
enhanced the activity (Fig. 4a, c). Piezo1 channel identity was
confirmed by sensitivity to inhibition by Gd3+ (Fig. 4a, c) which
blocks Piezo1 channels4, and absence of the channels in patches
from Piezo1ΔEC mice (Fig. 4c, d). There was no response to fluid
flow in the absence of Piezo1 (Fig. 4c, d). Moreover the fluid flow
effect was mimicked by Yoda1 (Supplementary Fig. 7), a small-
molecule activator of Piezo1 channels12, 13. The data suggest that
constitutive and fluid flow-enhanced Piezo1 channel activity is
common in mesenteric artery endothelial cells and that these
channels do not inactivate or depend on intracellular factors.
To explore the significance in membrane potential control,
freshly isolated sheets of mesenteric endothelium were used for
measurements without contamination from other cell types. The
sheets were syncitia of endothelial cells14 to which a patch-clamp
pipette was attached in whole-cell recording mode. The resting
membrane potential averaged about −46 mV in static resting
conditions and application of fluid flow caused reversible
depolarization (Fig. 5a, b). Importantly, application of the Piezo1
channel inhibitor Gd3+ or deletion of Piezo1 (Piezo1ΔEC) caused
hyperpolarization of the resting potential to an average of about
−60 mV, and fluid flow and Yoda1 now had no depolarizing
effect (Fig. 5a, b) (Supplementary Fig. 7). Incremental increases
in fluid flow up to and above fluid flow rates reported in

 anaesthetised mice15 incrementally depolarized the membrane
potential in a Piezo1-dependent manner (Fig. 5c).
The observations suggested a type of Piezo1 channel which is
sufficiently abundant and active to strongly regulate the resting
membrane potential. It is a specialised non-inactivating form of
Piezo1 channel but otherwise it has the expected unitary
conductance
and
pharmacology.
The
channel
is
strongly
constitutively active but can further activate in proportion to
fluid flow. The commonly reported inactivation of exogenously
over-expressed Piezo1 channels has previously been found to be
lost
after
pulses
of
mechanical
force
and
suppressed
by
application of force to extracellular domains without effect on
channel unitary conductance16, 17. There is therefore precedence
for Piezo1 channels adopting a non-inactivating state.
Coupling to voltage-gated Ca2+ entry in smooth muscle cells.
To understand how the Piezo1 mechanism could become relevant
at times of whole body physical activity, we hypothesized that the
increased blood flow in exercise drives depolarization which has
been shown previously to be efficiently coupled to the adjacent
vascular smooth muscle cells10, 18, 19 and could be sufficient to
activate pro-contractile voltage-gated Ca2+ channels20 only when
the depolarization reaches a particular range of values. To test this
hypothesis, we recorded from vascular smooth muscle cells
freshly isolated from second-order mesenteric artery. Increasing
depolarizations were applied by voltage-clamp to activate voltage-
gated Ca2+ currents. As expected these currents were small, close
to the technical limits of detection (Fig. 5d). Such channels have
no distinct threshold for activation but show exponential

 increases in opening probability with depolarization20. To take
account of this behaviour, we fitted the data with the Boltzmann
equation, leading to the suggestion that increases in Ca2+ entry
occurred progressively from −40 mV to more positive (Fig. 5e). In
the whole body, the cell-rich fluid of blood causes shear stress at
the endothelium and whole body physical activity increases shear
stress21. We demonstrated the principle that increasing fluid flow,
and thus shear stress, caused depolarization which reached the
activation range for voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (Fig. 5e). To test
this idea in the intact artery, we cannulated segments of second-
order mesenteric artery to apply pressure and flow to the lumen.
Importantly, increased flow caused vasoconstriction which was
inhibited by nicardipine, a blocker of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels
(Fig. 6a–c). In Piezo1ΔEC mice, flow-induced vasoconstriction
was absent (Figs. 6d, e). These data support a hypothesis whereby
precipitous increases in voltage-gated Ca2+ entry occur in smooth
muscle cells, leading to vasoconstriction when fluid flow along the
endothelial surface is sufficiently high.
There is absence of specific information on the absolute shear
stress experienced by endothelial cells in second-order mouse
mesenteric arteries at rest or during whole body physical activity.
In vivo, shear stress is complicated by the pulsating cardiac
rhythm, vascular architecture and arterial calibre, viscosity and
cellular content of the blood, and glycoprotein-polysaccharide
structures
between
blood
and
membrane
proteins
of
the
endothelial cells. Nevertheless, shear stress in mice is considered
to range from about 3 to 60 Pa22–24, consistent with our studies
(Fig. 5e). Values in humans are usually lower22, 23.
Endothelial Piezo1 is important for physical performance.
Based
on
the
above
findings,
we
hypothesised
a
Piezo1
mechanism which senses whole body physical activity in order to
constrict mesenteric resistance arteries with the purpose of
directing mesenteric blood flow away from the gastrointestinal
tract25, 26 to other organs—in particular skeletal muscle—to
improve physical performance. To test this idea, we quantitatively
investigated running wheel performance. Although the Piezo1ΔEC
mice were superficially normal (Fig. 1), their performance was
compromised (Fig. 7a–d) (Supplementary Fig. 8). The impact
of Piezo1ΔEC declined with continued exposure to the wheel,
suggesting compensated performance due to physical training
(Fig. 7a–c) despite the blood pressure lowering effect being
sustained (Fig. 3b). Although Piezo1ΔEC mice gained weight
normally in the absence of the wheel (Figs 1b and 7e), they lost
more weight than controls once they had access to the wheel,
suggesting that they were working harder to achieve their
expectations (Fig. 7e).
Therefore, we suggest a molecular mechanism for sensing
whole body physical activity: specialised Piezo1 channels in the
endothelium which beneficially impact on overall physical
performance. We outline a mechanistic principle by which the

 muscle increases2, so a vasodilator rather than vasoconstrictor
mechanism must dominate in resistance arteries of skeletal
muscle2. Similarly, blood flow to the brain is maintained or
slightly increased during physical activity to avoid syncope2.
Therefore, we investigated the significance of endothelial Piezo1
in saphenous artery, which supplies the leg, and carotid artery,
which supplies the brain. Saphenous artery was similar in calibre
to second-order mesenteric artery: its external diameter when
pressurized to 60 mm Hg was 284.2 ± 13.4 μm (n = 15) compared
with 279.8 ± 12.7 μm in mesenteric artery (n = 17). Carotid artery
was 428.8 ± 17.4 μm under similar conditions (n = 8). In contrast
to mesenteric artery (Fig. 2) the EDH(F) effect was not amplified
by Piezo1 disruption in saphenous or carotid artery (Fig. 8a–h)
(Supplementary Fig. 9). The data suggest vascular bed specificity
of Piezo1 in a way which enables it to enhance physical
performance.
Discussion
We have described the challenge presented by the Ca2+ and
depolarizing effects of Piezo1 channels in endothelial cells and
suggested a role for the depolarising effect in whole body physical
activity. Here, however, we have not addressed the relationship
between Piezo1 and nitric oxide synthase and nitric oxide sug-
gested previously7, 13. When we studied flow-induced vasocon-
striction, an inhibitor of endothelial nitric oxide synthase was
present in order to focus on the Piezo1 depolarization mechanism
(Fig. 6). Importantly, the Piezo1-dependence of increased blood
pressure in whole body physical activity suggests dominance of
the vasoconstrictor mechanism in vivo even without exogenous
nitric oxide synthase inhibition (Fig. 3b). This implies that the
nitric oxide mechanism is naturally suppressed in mesenteric
arteries and perhaps also in other arteries which constrict during
whole body physical activity such as those of the kidneys and
liver2. A flow-induced vasodilatation mechanism exists in
mesenteric arteries13, 27 but our data suggest that it is less
important than vasoconstriction during whole body physical
activity. The vasodilatory effect might of course be important in
other circumstances. The role of endothelial Piezo1 has been
studied in sedate mice where relevance of the nitric oxide
mechanism has been suggested13. The effect reported was how-
ever on systolic blood pressure, with no diastolic data shown13.
Because vasodilatation should affect diastolic pressure, it remains
to be clarified if endothelial Piezo1 is important for vasodilation
in vivo in sedentary mice. Our data suggest no role of endothelial
Piezo1 when mice are inactive between periods running on a
wheel (Fig. 3a).
The principles we describe here in the mouse may be impor-
tant in people because Piezo1 is a functional endothelial protein
in humans28 and whole body physical activity increases vascular
wall shear stress in humans21. In healthy individuals, systolic
blood pressure usually increases due to increased cardiac output
whereas
diastolic
blood
pressure
may
remain
unchanged
depending on the extent of vasodilation in skeletal muscle2.
Nevertheless, whole body physical activity redistributes blood
away from the intestines, suggesting importance of vasocon-
striction in the mesenteric bed25, 26. Exercise is commonly used as
an approach for protecting against or reducing hypertension in

and,
conversely,
exercise-induced
hypertension is suggested as an important predecessor of
persistent hypertension, which remains one of the major health
concerns of the twenty-first century30. Therefore developing
further methodologies and tools for studying Piezo1 and its
relationships to exercise-induced adaptations should be a valuable
area for future research.
Methods
Piezo1-modified mice. All animal use was authorized by the University of Leeds
Animal Ethics Committee and The Home Office, UK. All animals were maintained
in GM500 individually ventilated cages (Animal Care Systems), except during
telemetry recordings, at 21 °C 50–70% humidity, light/dark cycle 12/12 h on RM1
diet (SpecialDiet Services, Witham, UK) ad libitum and bedding of Pure’o Cell
(Datesand, Manchester, UK). Genotypes were determined using real-time PCR
with specific probes designed for each gene (Transnetyx, Cordova, TN). C57BL/6 J
mice with Piezo1 gene flanked with LoxP sites (Piezo1flox) were described pre-
viously7. To generate tamoxifen (TAM) inducible disruption of Piezo1 gene in the
endothelium, Piezo1flox mice were crossed with mice expressing cre recombinase
under the Cadherin5 promoter (Tg(Cdh5-cre/ERT2)1Rha and inbred to obtain
Piezo1flox/flox/Cdh5-cre mice. TAM (Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in corn oil
(Sigma-Aldrich) at 20 mg ml−1. Mice were injected intra-peritoneal with
75 mg kg−1 TAM for 5 consecutive days and studies were performed 10–14 days
later. Piezo1flox/flox/Cdh5-cre mice that received TAM injections are referred to as
Piezo1ΔEC. Piezo1flox/flox littermates (lacking Cdh5-cre) that received TAM
injections were the controls (control genotype). For experiments, mice were males
aged 12–16 weeks, except for telemetry (14–18-week old) and femoral artery injury
(18–22-week old).
Analysis of Piezo1 deletion. Samples (about 10 mm3) of liver, lung, aorta, femoral
artery and mesenteric artery were digested overnight at 37 °C in a lysis buffer
containing 10 mM Tris pH 7.4, 50 mM EDTA, 1 % SDS; 5 µg ml−1 proteinase K
(Sigma-Aldrich). Samples were then vortexed and 400 µl of phenol/chloroform/
isoamyl (Sigma-Aldrich) was added. Tubes were mixed by inverting/shaking 20
times every 15 min for 1 h then centrifuged at 13,000×g for 15 min at room tem-
perature. Four-hundred microliter of the top layer was transferred to a new tube
followed by an addition of 440 µl of isopropanol and 40 µl of 3 M NaCl. Tubes were
mixed by gentle inverting and left to stand for 1 h at room temperature. DNA was
pelleted by centrifugation at 13,000×g for 30 min at room temperature. The
supernatant was discarded and the pellet was washed with 70% ethanol, briefly air
dried and resuspended in 60 µl of TE buffer. DNA was amplified using 12.5 µl
Bioline MyTaq Red Mix, 0.5 µl of DNA solution, 1 µM of each primer. Sequences of
PCR primers are specified in Supplementary Table 1. PCR was 95 °C for 5 min; 32
cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s; 72 °C for 5 min. PCR products
were electrophoresed on 2 % agarose gels containing SYBR safe (Roche) at 80 V for
45 min.

lated using an immunomagnetic separation technique. A whole mouse liver was

 minced using 2 scalpel blades and resuspended in a dissociation solution consisting
of 9 ml 0.1 % collagenase II, 1 ml 2.5 U ml−1 dispase, 1 µM CaCl2 and 1 μM MgCl2
in Hanks Buffer solution. The tissue-dissociation mix was incubated at 37 °C for 50
min in a MACSMix Tube Rotator (Miltenyi Biotech) to provide continuous agi-
tation. At the end of enzymatic digestion the sample was passed through 100 and
40 μm cell strainers to remove any undigested tissue. Cells were washed twice in
PEB buffer consisting of Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS), EDTA 2 mM and 0.5%
Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA), pH 7.2. The washed pellets were resuspended in
1 ml of PEB buffer and 200 µl of dead cell removal paramagnetic microbeads per
1 × 107 cells (Miltneyi Biotec) at room temperature for 15 min. After incubation the
cells were passed through an LS column prepared with 1 × binding buffer (Miltenyi
Biotec) in a magnetic field (MiniMACS Separator, Miltenyi Biotec). The eluate was
then incubated with 20 ml red blood cell lysis buffer consisting of 0.206 g Tris base,
0.749 g NH4Cl in 100 ml PBS pH to 7.2. Cells were washed again in PEB buffer, and
the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml PEB buffer and 30 µl CD146 microbeads
(Miltenyi Biotec) at 4 °C for 15 min under continuous agitation. After incubation
this solution was passed through an MS column prepared with PEB buffer. CD146
positive cells were retained in the column and CD146 negative cells passed through
as eluate. CD146 positive cells were washed through with warm EGM-2 media and
the CD146 selection process was repeated a second time. After a second pur-
ification cells were plated and grown in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Media were
changed at 12 h and then every 24 h until confluent.
Piezo1 inducible cell line. Piezo1-GFP7 was used as a PCR template to clone
human Piezo1 coding sequence into pcDNA™4/TO between HindIII and EcoRI
restriction sites. Piezo1 was amplified as two fragments using the following
primers: (HindIII-Piezo1-Fw: AATAAGCTTATGGAGCCGCACGTG and
BamHI-Int.Piezo1-Rv: AATGGATCCCCCTGGACTGTCG) and (BamHI-Int.
Piezo1-Fw: AATGGATCCTCCCCGCCACGGA and EcoRI-Piezo1-Rv: AATGAA
TTCTTACTCCTTCTCACGAGT). The two fragments were fused using BamHI
restriction site, resulting in the full length Piezo1 coding sequence with the c4182a
silent mutation. T-RExTM-293 cells were transfected with pcDNA4/TO-Piezo1
using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Subsequently cells were
treated with 10 μg ml−1 blasticidin and 200 μg ml−1 zeocin (Invitrogen, Thermo
Fisher Scientific) to select stably transfected cells. Single cell clones were isolated
and analysed individually. Expression was induced by treating the cells for 24 h
with 10 ng ml−1 tetracycline (Sigma-Aldrich) and analysed by quantitative RT-PCR
and western blot.
Fura-2 Ca2+ measurements. Intracellular Ca2+ was measured using the ratio-
metric Ca2+ indicator dye fura-2. Experiments were performed on confluent cells in
a 96-well plate. Cells in each well were incubated with 50 μl fura-2 AM loading
solution for 1 h at 37 °C. The loading solution consisted of 2 µM fura-2 AM and
0.01% pluronic acid in Standard Bath Solution (Ca2+-SBS) consisting of 130 mM
NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1.2 mM MgCl2, 1.5 mM CaCl2, 8 mM D-glucose and 10 mM
HEPES (pH 7.4). After 1 h the loading solution was removed and 100 μl of
Ca2+-SBS was added to each well and left at room temperature for 30 min. A
compound plate was prepared at twice the final concentration tested in Ca2+-SBS.
The FlexStation II384 was set to add 80 μl of the compound solution to each well on
the test plate containing 80 μl of Ca2+-SBS. Baseline fluorescence ratios were

 recorded before addition of the compound solution to the cell plate after 60 s, with
regular recordings thereafter for a total of 5 min.
Thallium FluxOR measurements. Cells were plated at 80–90% confluence in
96-well plates 24 h prior to recordings (5 × 104 Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK)
T-REx cells; 1.92 × 104 Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs)). HEK
T-Rex cells were from Thermo Fisher Scientific (catalogue #R71007) and HUVECs
were from Lonza (catalogue #CC-2519). HEK T-Rex cells were validated to be
tetracycline-responsive (as expected) (Supplementary Fig. 6). HUVECs were
validated by positive staining with anti-CD31 antibody, response to vascular
endothelial growth factor, and alignment of the cells to shear stress; human
nucleotide sequences were detected, confirming human origin. To measure
thallium (Tl+) influx, cells were loaded with the FluxORTM dye for 1 h at room
temperature, transferred to assay buffer and stimulated with a Tl+ containing K
+-free solution as per the manufacturer’s instructions (Molecular Probes). Mea-
surements were made on a fluorescence plate reader (FlexStation II384). FluxOR
was excited at 485 nm and emitted light collected at 520 nm, measurements
expressed as a ratio increase over baseline (F/F0), with vehicle (DMSO) values
subtracted from Yoda1 values at each time point (ΔF/F0). Rates of increase in
fluorescence intensity were determined between 7.5 and 35 s after injection of
Yoda1
(ΔF/F0/ms).
Arterial contraction studies. Animals were culled by cervical dislocation
according to Schedule 1 procedure approved by the UK Home Office. Mesenteric
arcades were dissected out and placed immediately into ice-cold Krebs solution
(125 mM NaCl, 3.8 mM KCl, 1.2 mM CaCl2, 25 mM NaHCO3, 1.2 mM KH2PO4,
1.5 mM MgSO4, 0.02 mM EDTA and 8 mM D-glucose, pH 7.4). Second-order
mesenteric, saphenous or carotid arteries were cleaned of fat and connective tissue
under a dissection microscope. Segments of 1 mm length were mounted in an
isometric wire myograph system (Multi Wire Myograph System, 620 M), bathed
with Krebs solution warmed at 37 °C and gassed with 95% O2/5% CO2 then
stretched stepwise radially to their optimum resting level to an equivalent trans-
mural pressure of 100 mm Hg and equilibrated for 1 h prior to experiments.
For studies of luminal flow in second-order mesenteric artery, vessel segments
were mounted on glass cannulas in a pressure myograph (Model 110p, Danish
Myo Technology A/S, Denmark). Flow was generated by increasing the pressure
difference (ΔP) between inflow and outflow without change in the absolute
intraluminal pressure. The outer arterial diameter was monitored using a CCD
camera (DMX41 AU02, Imaging Source Europe, Germany) and recorded with
MyoView II software. Arteries were only used for investigation if they
constricted in response to phenylephrine (PE) and dilated in response to
acetylcholine (ACh).
Blood pressure measurements. Conscious long-term recordings of arterial blood
pressure (mean, systolic and diastolic) were achieved via a radiotelemetry probe
(model TA11PA-C10, Data Sciences International). Adult male mice (14–18-week
old) were anaesthetised with isoflurane (5% induction 1.5% maintenance) in 95%
O2 and body temperature maintained via a heating pad. The probe catheter was
advanced, via the left carotid artery, into the ascending aorta. The body of the
transmitter was placed in a subcutaneous pocket along the left flank. A period of at
least 14 days was allowed for recovery from surgery before the start of experimental
recordings. TAM treatment started 4 days after probe implantation and recordings
started 10 days after the last TAM injection. Mice were housed singly in cages and
synchronized to a light–dark cycle of 12:12 h with lights on at 06:00 h. Cages were
positioned over receivers connected to a computer system for data recording. Blood
pressure waveforms and parameters were analysed using DSI analysis package,
Dataquest ART 4.1. Continuous 24 h recordings were begun 3 days following
singular housing and obtained over a 7 day period. During the recording period
animals were allowed free access to a voluntary running wheel.
Freshly isolated mesenteric endothelial cells. Endothelial cells were freshly
isolated from second-order branches of mouse mesenteric arteries as described
previously14. Briefly, dissected second-order mesenteric arteries were enzymatically
digested in dissociation solution (126 mM NaCl, 6 mM KCl, 10 mM Glucose,
11 mM HEPES, 1.2 mM MgCl2, 0.05 mM CaCl2, with pH adjusted to 7.2)
containing 1 mg ml−1 collagenase Type IA (Sigma-Aldrich, Dorset, UK) for 14 min
at 37 °C and then triturated gently to release the endothelial cells on a glass
coverslip.
Patch-clamp electrophysiology. Membrane potential was measured using the
perforated whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique in current clamp
mode with an Axopatch-200A amplifier (Axon Instruments, Inc.) equipped with
Digidata 1440 A and pCLAMP 10.6 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA,
USA) at room temperature. Outside-out membrane patch recordings were made
using the same equipment but in voltage-clamp mode. Endothelial cells and
endothelium were bathed in a solution consisting of 135 mM NaCl, 4 mM KCl,
2 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 10 mM glucose and 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4). Heat-
polished patch pipettes with tip resistances between 3 and 5 MΩ were used. For
membrane potential recordings, amphotericin B (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as the
perforating agent, added in the pipette solution composed of 145 mM KCl, 1 mM
MgCl2, 0.5 mM EGTA and 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.2). For application of fluid flow,
endothelium or membrane patches were manoeuvred to the exit of a capillary tube
with tip diameter of 350 μm, out of which ionic (bath) solution flowed at rates
specified in the main text and figure legends. Calculation of shear stress (τω) was
achieved using the Hagen-Poiseuille formula31 (τω = 4μQ/πR3) where μ is dynamic
viscosity, Q is flow rate and R is radius of the capillary tube.
Echocardiography. Animals were maintained under steady-state isofluorane
anaesthesia and placed on a heated platform with ECG and respiration monitoring.
Core temperature was measured using a rectal probe (Indus Instruments) and
maintained at 37.5 °C throughout recording. Echocardiography was performed
using a Vevo2100 high resolution, pre-clinical in vivo ultrasound system (Visual-
Sonics) with the MS-550D transducer at 40 MHz frequency and 100% power.
Imaging was performed on a layer of aquasonic gel after the pre-cordial skin had
been clipped and de-epliated with cream (Veet). Parasternal long-axis view (PLAX)
images were obtained in EKV mode (set at 1000 Hz for recording) over the entire
cardiac cycle. The left ventricular area was traced in end-distole (LVAd) and end-
systole (LVAs) and used to derive the ejection fraction (EF) with the Vevo LAB
cardiac package software. The investigator performing sonography was blinded to
the genotype of the animals. Transverse EKV recordings were also obtained over
the abdominal aorta just below the diaphragm using the same settings as described
for the heart. These images were evaluated in the VevoVasc software package to
determine vessel distensibility. Maximal anteroposterior aortic diameter (from
inner wall to inner wall) was measured in the same images in systole and diastole
using Vevo LAB general imaging package software.
Retina vasculature staining and analysis. Retinas were dissected from eyes after
fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 4 h at room temperature, then stored
overnight at 4 °C in permeabilisation and blocking buffer (PBS; 0.5% triton; 1%
BSA; 0.01% sodium deoxycholate; 0.02% sodium azide; 0.1 mM CaCl2; 0.1 mM
MgCl2; 0.1 mM MnCl2). Retinal vasculature was then stained overnight at 4 °C with
isolectin B4 Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate (Molecular Probes, Thermo Fisher), diluted
1:100 in PBLEC buffer (PBS; 1% triton; 0.1 mM CaCl2; 0.1 mM MgCl2; 0.1 mM
MnCl2). Retinas were washed with 0.25% Triton in PBS, then flat-mounted
on slides with ProLong Gold (Molecular Probes, Thermo Fisher). Confocal
microscopy (LSM 880, Zeiss) was used to image retinas, with analysis blinded to
genotype conducted using ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD). Distal arterial
diameter was analysed 1500 μm from the optic disc in the largest branch of each
artery emanating from the disc. Capillary area was determined in regions of
interest, which excluded arteries and veins, using the threshold function and
fractional area measurement.
Femoral injury. Experiments were carried out on 18–22-week-old male mice.
Femoral injury was performed 12–16 days after the last TAM injection. Mice were
anesthetized with isoflurane (1.5–2%) before a small incision was made in the mid-
thigh and extended. Having carefully isolated the femoral artery, an arteriotomy
was made in the saphenous artery using iris scissors (World-Precision Instruments,
Sarasota, FL) and a 0.014-inch-diameter angioplasty guidewire with tapered tip
(Hi-Torque Cross-It 200XT, Abbott-Vascular, IL) was introduced. The guidewire
was advanced 1.5 cm in to the femoral artery, and three passages performed per
mouse, resulting in complete endothelial denudation. The guidewire was removed
completely and a suture tightened rapidly immediately distal to the bifurcation of
the femoral artery. The skin was closed with a continuous suture. Animals received
peri-operative analgesia with buprenorphine (0.25 mg kg−1 s.c.). Mice were anes-
thetized at 5 days after wire injury and 50 μl of 0.5% Evans blue dye injected into
the inferior vena cava. The mice were perfused/fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in
PBS before the femoral arteries were collected. The vessels were opened long-
itudinally. The areas stained and unstained in blue were measured in a 5 mm
injured segment beginning 5 mm distal to the aortic bifurcation, and the percentage
areas were calculated using ImagePro Plus 7.0 software (Media Cybernetics,
Bethesda, MD).
Running wheel analysis. Mice were individually housed and had free access to a
running wheel. Custom-built hardware and software allowed detailed character-
istics of running activity to be recorded for each animal. A mouse was considered
to be active when there were ≥ 2 revolutions of the running wheel during each 1
min recording period. This equates to ≈10% of the mean dark cycle velocity of
running for control animals (0.34 m/s). Continuous periods of activity (bouts) were
defined as activity seen in two or more consecutive minutes. One Piezo1ΔEC mouse
showed complete inactivity for the first 3 days and was excluded from the analysis
along with its control genotype pair.
Cell and tissue staining. Epididymal fat pad and liver tissues were fixed for 48 h in
4% PFA at 4 °C prior to processing on a Leica ASP 200 and embedding in CellWax
(Cellpath) on a Leica EG1150H embedding station. Sections of 4 μm were cut on a
Leica RM2235 microtome onto Plus Frost slides (Solmedia) and allowed to dry at
37 °C overnight prior to staining. Slides were de-waxed in xylene and rehydrated in

 ethanol. H&E was performed by staining in Mayer’s Haematoxylin for 2 min and
eosin for 2 min. Slides were imaged on an Aperio AT2 (Leica Biosystems) high
definition digital pathology slide scanner with a maximal magnification of ×20.
Tissue processing and imaging were performed at Section of Pathology and
Tumour Biology, Leeds Institute of Cancer and Pathology. For CD31 immuno-
fluorescence, cells were fixed on coverslips in 4% paraformaldehyde and
permeablised with 0.1% TritonX-100 at room temperature. Cells were blocked
with donkey serum for 30 min to prevent non-specific binding. Cells were then
incubated with 1% BSA in PBS containing rabbit anti-mouse CD31 (1:50,
Abcam ab28364). Following incubation with primary antibody, cells were washed
in PBS and incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated affinipure donkey anti-
rabbit IgG (1:300, Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories) for 45 min at room
temperature. Cells were mounted with Prolong Gold Antifade Reagent containing
DAPI (Invitrogen) and visualised using a LSM 880 confocal microscope (Zeiss).
RNA isolation and quantitative PCR. Total RNA was isolated using a standard
TriReagent protocol and treated with DNAse (TURBO DNA-free, AM1907M,
Ambion). An aliquot was used for cDNA synthesis using a High Capacity RNA-to-
cDNA kit (Applied Biosystems, UK) containing Oligo-dT and random primers.
Real-time PCR was performed using Roche Fast Start SYBR Green I on a Light-
cycler2 with Lightcycler 3.5 software or using Roche 480 SYBR Green I on a
Lightcycler480II with Lightcycler 1.5.62 software. DNA amplification was for 35
cycles with an initial 10 min at 95 °C followed by 10 s at 95 °C, 6 s at 55 °C and 14 s
at 72 °C. Primers were used at 0.5 μM. Sequences of PCR primers are specified in
Supplementary Table 1. The specificity of PCR was verified by reactions without
RT (-RT) and by melt-curve analysis. PCR cycle crossing-points (CP) were
determined by fit-points methodology. Relative abundance of target RNA
was calculated from (E18sCp)/(EtargetCp). All quantitative PCR reactions
were performed in duplicate and the data averaged to generate one value per
experiment.
Data analysis. Genotypes of mice were always blinded to the experimenter and
mice were studied in random order determined by the genotype of litters. Data
were generated in pairs (control mice and Piezo1ΔEC mice) and data sets compared
statistically by independent t-test without assuming equal variance. Paired t-tests
were used when comparing data before and after application of flow or a substance
to the same membrane patch or cell. Statistical significance was considered to exist
at probability (P) < 0.05 (* < 0.05, ** < 0.01, *** < 0.001). Where data comparisons
lack an asterisk, they were not significantly different. The number of independent
experiments (mice or independent cell cultures) is indicated by n. For multi-well
assays or multiple cell on coverslip studies, the number of replicates is indicated by
N. Descriptive statistics are shown as mean ± s.e.m. unless indicated as mean ± s.d.
(standard deviation). Origin Pro software was used for data analysis and
presentation.
