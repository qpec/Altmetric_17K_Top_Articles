Abstract 
 
∆9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) consumption during adolescence is reported to be a risk 
factor for the appearance of psychiatric disorders later in life. The interaction between 
genetic or environmental events and cannabinoid exposure in the adolescent period can 
also contribute to exacerbate behavioural deficits in adulthood. Here we investigate the 
effects of THC treatment as well as the consequences of concomitant THC and stress 
exposure during adolescence in the extinction of fear memory in adult mice. Adolescent 
mice treated with THC and exposed to stress exhibit impaired cued fear extinction in 
adulthood. However, no effect was observed in animals exposed to these two factors 
separately. Notably, resistance to fear extinction was associated with decreased neuronal 
activity in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and the infralimbic prefrontal cortex, 
suggesting a long-term dysregulation of the fear circuit. These changes in neuronal 
activation were paralleled with structural plasticity alterations. Indeed, an increase of 
immature dendritic spines in pyramidal neurons of the BLA was revealed in mice 
simultaneously exposed to THC and stress. Corticosterone levels were also enhanced 
after the cued fear conditioning session in the same experimental group. These results 
show that an interaction between cannabis exposure and stress during adolescence may 
lead to long-term anxiety disorders characterized by the presence of pathological fear.

1. Introduction  
Cannabis remains the most widely used illicit substance worldwide. The regular use of 
cannabis often begins during adolescence which is of particular concern because this 
period is crucial to generate efficient neuronal pathways by constant neuroplastic shaping, 
synaptic reorganization and neurochemical changes (Sturman and Moghaddam, 2011). 
Pharmacological and/or environmental factors affecting the endocannabinoid system 
during the adolescent period can lead to altered brain maturation considering the 
important role played by this system in the neurodevelopmental changes that occur during 
this time (Fernández-Ruiz et al, 2000; Harkany et al, 2007). As a consequence, preclinical 
and epidemiological data suggest that adolescent cannabinoid exposure may increase the 
risk for the appearance of psychiatric diseases in adult life (Malone et al, 2010; Higuera-
Matas et al, 2015), including emotional dysregulation. Recent studies relate cannabis use 
in adolescence with amygdala hypersensitivity to signals of threat (Spechler et al, 2015), 
and with an increased likelihood of having posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms in 
adulthood (Lee et al, 2017). Other disturbances associated with adolescent cannabis use 
may include psychotic-like symptoms, cognitive deficits, and increased addiction 
vulnerability (Silins et al, 2014; Renard et al, 2016).  
Most psychiatric disorders involve multiple ethiopathological factors that can interact 
across the lifespan and trigger disease onset (Caspi and Moffit, 2006). The interaction 
between cannabis consumption and genetic or environmental factors during adolescence 
may have a crucial influence in the detrimental effects of this drug later in life (Rubino 
and Parolaro, 2016). Adult mice with genetic mutations in some genes involved in 
schizophrenia (O’Tuathaigh et al, 2012; Long et al, 2013; Ballinger et al, 2015) or 
exposed to stressful events early in life (Llorente-Berzal et al, 2011; Zamberletti et al, 
 4 
 
2012; Klug and van den Buuse, 2012) showed altered behavioural responses due to ∆9-
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) adolescent treatment. This interaction of cannabis exposure 
and genetic/environmental events produces protective or negative effects depending on 
the genetic profile, sex, and stress level (Rubino and Parolaro, 2016).  
The most consistent consequences of adolescent cannabinoid exposure are related to 
long-term impairments in cognitive function. Thus, numerous studies have shown 
working memory deficits in animals exposed to different cannabinoid agonists during 
adolescence (Renard et al, 2016). The consequences in emotional memory have been less 
studied, although adolescent THC administration did not produce lasting effects in this 
behaviour (Ballinger et al, 2015; Rubino et al, 2009a; Rubino et al, 2009b). However, 
whether adolescent cannabinoid exposure alone or in combination with environmental 
factors such as stress affects the extinction of fear memory in adult life remains to be 
elucidated. Cannabis consumption and stressful events are often associated (Ketcherside 
and Filbey, 2015). The effects in adulthood of cannabis consumption during adolescence 
may be exacerbated by stress exposure in this period of life. Moreover, stress and fear 
responses share common neural circuits, and the neuronal structures involved in fear 
acquisition and extinction are also highly sensitive to stress effects (Stockhorst and 
Antov, 2016). 
Here, we reveal that concomitant THC and stress adolescent exposure induces long-term 
impairment in fear extinction. This effect is associated with reduced neuronal activity and 
structural plasticity changes in key limbic brain regions. These findings suggest that THC 
chronic consumption under stress conditions during adolescence may increase the risk for 
the appearance of anxiety disorders related to trauma exposure.

2. Materials and Methods   
2.1. Animals 
Adolescent female and male, and adult male C57BL6/J mice (Charles River, France) were 
used in these experiments. Animals were housed 3-5 per cage in a room with controlled 
temperature (21±1ºC), and humidity (55±10%) and with a 12h light/12h dark cycle. All 
behavioural studies were conducted during the light period. Food and water were 
available ad libitum. Animal procedures were performed in accordance with the 
guidelines of the European Communities Council Directive 2010/63/EU and approved by 
the local ethical committee (CEEA-IMAS-UPF), and the statement of compliance with 
standards for use of laboratory animals by foreign institutions nr. 5388-01 approved by 
the National Institutes of Health. All behavioural data were obtained by experimental 
observers blinded to the experimental conditions.  
 
2.2. Drugs                                                                                                                                                                          
THC stored at 100 mg/ml in ethanol (THC-Pharm-GmbH, Germany) was diluted in 5% 
Tween-80 and physiological saline solution to achieve doses of 3, 6 and 12 mg/kg (5 
ml/kg of body weight). 
 
2.3. Experimental designs 
2.3.1. Adolescent THC treatment 
The long-term effects of THC administration in anxiety-like responses, locomotor 
activity, and fear conditioning expression and extinction were evaluated in adolescent 
 6 
 
male and female mice. Adolescence, which is a vulnerable period for the onset of 
neuropsychiatric disorders, covers the complete time span from childhood (shortly before 
puberty) to adulthood, including the pubertal period (Schneider, 2013). The timing of 
human adolescence is difficult to define (Schneider, 2008), and therefore the exact timing 
of this period in laboratory rodents represents a challenge in animal research (Schneider, 
2013). Starting at PND 35, mice were subcutaneously administered with increasing doses 
of THC (PND 35-39: 3 mg/kg, PND 40-44: 6 mg/kg, and PND 45-49: 12 mg/kg) or 
vehicle during 15 days in order to counter the development of drug tolerance (Renard et 
al, 2017). Similar protocols using escalating doses of THC during adolescence have been 
previously used in numerous studies (Rubino et al. 2008; Llorente-Berzal et al. 2013; 
Cadoni et al. 2015). Moreover, comparable time frames for adolescent cannabinoid 
treatment in both male and female rodents have been previously reported (Biscaia et al, 
2003; Rubino et al, 2008; Realini et al, 2011; Bartolato et al, 2014; Zamberletti et al, 
2014). Male and female mice could be at different stages of the development at the onset 
and during the treatment schedule. However, the objective of our study was to evaluate 
in adult mice the possible effects of THC treatment during the adolescent period, a crucial 
life stage for the neuronal development. From PND 50 to 69, animals remained 
undisturbed. At PND 70, behavioural evaluation was carried out in the order described in 
Fig. 1A for male and in Fig. S1 for female mice. The interval of time between adolescent 
THC or vehicle treatment and adult behavioural experiments is similar to those used in 
previous reports (Quinn et al. 2008; Llorente-Berzal et al. 2013). On the other hand, long-
term stress of injection effects during adolescence (Keeley et al, 2015; Simone et al, 
2018a; Simone et al, 2018b) have been previously reported, which may reflect a greater 
vulnerability of adolescent animals to repeated physical stress exposure. However, 
 7 
 
control groups were injected with vehicle in our experimental protocols suggesting that 
the effects observed in mice treated with THC were due to this drug.   
2.3.2. Concomitant THC and stress adolescent exposure  
To assess the interaction between THC and mild stress, adolescent male mice treated with 
THC or vehicle, as previously described, were exposed to different stressors: forced 
swimming, tail suspension and restraint. Similar stressors, applied singly or in 
combination, either acutely or chronically, have been used in previous studies to 
investigate the role of stress in fear processing (Maren and Holmes, 2016). At the end of 
each 5-days vehicle or THC exposure, one stressor was applied as shown in Fig. 2A. 
Moreover, two additional stressors were applied at PND 60 (forced swimming) and 65 
(tail suspension) (Fig. 2A). Behavioural evaluation was carried out at PND 70 in the order 
shown in Fig. 2A. 
2.3.3. Concomitant THC and stress adult exposure 
To evaluate whether the long-term effects of simultaneous THC and stress exposure were 
age dependent, a similar experimental design was performed in adult male mice (Fig. 
S2A). Starting at PND 56, mice were subcutaneously administered with increasing doses 
of THC (PND 56-60: 3 mg/kg, PND 61-65: 6 mg/kg, and PND 66-70: 12 mg/kg) or 
vehicle during 15 days. At the end of each 5-days THC exposure one stressor was applied 
as previously described (Fig 2A and Fig. S2A). Two additional stressors were applied at 
PND 80 (forced swimming) and 85 (tail suspension). Behavioural evaluation was carried 
out at PND 90 in the order described in Fig. S2A.

2.4. Stress procedure 
2.4.1. Forced Swimming 
Mice were placed in a clear Plexiglas cylinder containing water (20 ± 1ºC) for 6 min. The 
depth of the container and the volume of water were enough to prevent the animal 
touching the bottom, thus forcing mice to swim. 
2.4.2. Tail Suspension 
Animals were suspended by a 15 cm thin string hanged from a metal rod and stuck with 
adhesive tape 1cm from the tip of the tail. The front paws were sufficiently distant to the 
ground to avoid mice touching it. Tail suspension was performed during 6 min. 
2.4.3. Restraint 
Stress was induced by immobilizing the animal with a restrainer apparatus. Mice were 
placed individually inside a 50 ml conical tube with 0.5 cm air holes for breathing without 
access to food or water for 30 min. 
 
2.5. Behavioural experiments 
2.5.1. Locomotor Activity 
Changes in horizontal activity were assessed by using locomotor activity boxes (9 x 20 x 
11 cm, Imetronic, France). Mice were placed in locomotor cages with low luminosity. 
Activity was measured as the total number of horizontal photocell counts during 15 min. 
2.5.2. Elevated Plus Maze  
Elevated plus maze was performed to evaluate anxiety-like responses (Rubino et al, 
2008). The maze consisted of four arms (16 x 5 cm) extended from a central square (5 x 
 9 
 
5 cm) shaping a cross. Two opposite arms were delimited by vertical walls (closed arms), 
whereas the two other opposite arms had unprotected edges (open arms). The apparatus 
was elevated 30 cm above the floor and indirectly illuminated from the top (50-60 lux in 
the open arm). A 5 min trial was conducted by placing each animal in the central square 
and facing one of the open arms. The performance was recorded with a video camera 
system located above the maze. Results are expressed as the total entries to the closed and 
open arms, and the percentage of time spent in the open arms with respect to the total 
amount of time spent in both arms. An arm entry was counted when the animal moved 
both front paws into the arm.  
2.5.3. Fear Conditioning  
Training and testing were conducted as described previously with some modifications 
(Bilkei-Gorzo et al., 2012; Na et al., 2012; Flores et al., 2014; Soria-Gómez et al., 2015). 
Mice were individually placed in a shuttle chamber (LE918, Panlab, Barcelona) 
surrounded by a sound-attenuating cabinet (Flores et al, 2014). The chamber floor was 
formed by parallel stainless-steel bars connected to a scrambled shock generator. On the 
training day, mice were habituated to the chamber during 180 s before the exposure to an 
acute beeping 30 s sound (80 dB) repeated 3 times with a 10 s silenced interval. Each 
animal received an unconditioned stimulus (US) (0.7 mA footshock during 2s) paired 
with the end of each sound (conditioned stimulus, CS). After the third shock, the animal 
remained 30 s in the shuttle chamber. To test context-induced fear conditioning, mice 
were placed in the shuttle chamber 24 h after the training. Fear memory was assessed as 
the percentage of time that mice spent freezing during the first 3 min. Freezing response, 
a rodent’s natural response to fear, was evaluated by direct observation and defined as 
complete lack of movement, except for respiration for more than 1 s. To evaluate cued 
 10 
 
fear conditioning (session 1), mice were re-exposed to the CS in a novel environment (a 
wide dark cylinder) 24 h after context acquisition. Mice were allowed to adapt for 3 min 
to the new environment which was followed by 30 s of the sound used in the training day. 
This sound was repeated 4 times with a 10 s interval. Freezing was scored during the time 
the sound was active. After the last sound trial, mice remained in the cylinder for 30 s. 
2.5.4. Extinction training 
Extinction training was initiated 24 h after the cue-dependent fear conditioning test. Mice 
were placed in the fear conditioning cylinder with a novel environment as described 
above. Mice were given once daily extinction training sessions for 5 days (sessions 2-6). 
The percentage of freezing time was calculated by following the same experimental 
procedure as in the session 1. The habituation time was reduced to 1 min as mice were 
previously adapted to the new context. Data from fear extinction in adult male mice 
exposed to THC and stress during the adolescent period were expressed as percentage of 
freezing behaviour and as area under the curve (AUC). AUC was calculated by using a 
standard trapezoid method, AUC=[0.5 × (B1+ B2) × h] + [0.5 × (B2+ B3) × h] +…[0.5 
× (Bn+ Bn+1) × h], where Bn were the percentage of freezing behaviour for each mouse 
and h was the time (days) passed between the consecutive measurements (Gibaldi and 
Perrier, 1975). 
 
2.6. Immunoblot analysis 
Amygdala tissue was extracted 25 days after the last THC or vehicle administration 
(PND74). Tissue was immediately frozen and store at -80ºC. Amygdala was 
homogenized in 30 volumes lysis buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors. 
Samples were then centrifugated to eliminate any solid residue. Equal amounts of protein 
 11 
 
samples (20μg/well) were separated in 10% polyacrylamide gels before electrophoretic 
transfer onto to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked during 
1h in 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA)-T-TBS prior incubation for 2 h with the primary 
antibodies: CB1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1R) (rabbit polyclonal, 1:500) and anti-
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH, mouse monoclonal, 1:15000) 
form Frontier Institute (Cb1-Rb-Af380-1) and Santa Cruz Biotechnology (sc-32233), 
respectively. Then, membranes were rinsed 3 times and incubated for 1 h with their 
corresponding secondary antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase: rabbit (1:10000) 
and mouse (1:10000) from Cell Signaling. Immunochemiluminescence was produced by 
incubation of the membranes with West-femto ECL substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific). 
Images of immunoreactive bands were acquire on a ChemiDoc XRS System (Bio-Rad) 
and quantified by The Quantity One software v4.6.3 (Bio-Rad). The values obtained for 
CB1R were normalized to the detection of GAPDH in the same sample and expressed as 
a percentage of the control group (Vehicle-Non stress) (Fig. S3).   
 
2.7. Plasma corticosterone quantification  
Blood samples were collected at different time points: immediately after restraint (PND 
49), at PND 67 (basal), and 30 min after training (PND 72), cued-fear conditioning 
(session 1) (PND 74) and cued-fear extinction (session 5) (PND 78) (Fig. 3A). Blood 
samples were obtained from the tail in tubes containing ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. 
Double-antibody radioimmunoassay (RIA) was used to determine plasma corticosterone 
levels. RIA used 125I-corticosterone-carboximethyloxime-tyrosine-methyl ester (ICN-
Biolink 2000, Spain), synthetic corticosterone (Sigma, Spain) as the standard, and an 
antibody raised in rabbits against corticosteronecarboxi-methyloxime-BSA kindly 
provided by Dr G. Makara (Institute of Experimental Medicine, Budapest, Hungary). 
 12 
 
Plasma corticosteroid-binding globulin was inactivated by low pH. All samples to be 
statistically compared were quantified in the same assay to avoid inter-assay variability. 
 
2.8. Immunofluorescence  
Two h after the last cued fear extinction session or just before behavioural testing, mice 
were deeply anesthetized by ip injection (0.2 ml/10g body weight) of a mixture of 
ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (20 mg/kg) prior to rapid intracardiac perfusion. Mice 
were intracardically perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) solution. Brains were 
removed from skull and post-fixed in PFA for 24 h at 4ºC. Then, brains were transferred 
to a solution of 30% sucrose in PB 0.1M and kept at 4ºC. Coronal sections of 30 µm 
containing the prelimbic (PL) and infralimbic (IL) prefrontal cortex (from bregma 1.98 
mm to 1.54 mm) and the basolateral amygdala (BLA) (from bregma -1.22 mm to -1.82 
mm) were obtained using a microtome. Brain slices were stored in a solution of 5% 
sucrose PB 0.1M. Free floating slices were rinsed in PB 0.1M and after blocked in a 
solution containing 3% donkey serum and 0.3% Triton X-100 in PB 0.1M (DS-T-PB) 
during 2 h at room temperature. Slices were incubated overnight with the primary 
antibody anti-c-Fos in DS-T-PB at 4ºC (1:500, rabbit, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (sc-
7202). Next day, after three rinses with PB 0.1M, slices were incubated with the 
secondary antibody AlexaFluor-555 donkey anti-rabbit (1:500, Life Technologies) at 
room temperature for 2 h in DS-T-PB. Then, slices were rinsed three times and mounted 
with Mowiol onto glass slides coated with gelatin. 
 
 
 13 
 
2.9. Immunofluorescence Image Analysis 
The stained sections were analyzed at 10x objective using a Leica DMR microscope 
(Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) equipped with a digital camera Leica DFC 
300FX (Leica Microsystems). For PL and IL analysis, a 430 µm sided square region of 
interest (ROI) was delimited for quantification. The expression of cFos in the images was 
quantified using the ImageJ analysis software. The option “particle counting” under a 
fixed threshold configuration was used to detect cFos positive cells. For all areas, 4 
images per mice were quantified. Data are expressed as density of cFos positive cells per 
mm2 (6-9 mice per each experimental condition). 
 
2.10. Ballistic labeling with the fluorescent dye DiI 
Mice were deeply anesthetized after the last cued fear extinction session by ip injection 
(0.2 ml/10g body weight) of a mixture of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (20 mg/kg) 
prior to rapid intracardiac perfusion. Mice were perfused with 10 ml of PBS 0.1M, pH 
7.5 followed by 40 ml of 4% (PFA) in PB 0.1M. Brains were postfixed in 4% PFA for 10 
min. Then, brains were kept in PBS 0.1M for 12 h. Brain coronal sections (100 µm) 
containing the amygdala (from bregma -1.22 mm to -1.82mm) were obtained by using a 
vibratome (Leica VT 1000 S) and kept in PBS 0.1M until fluorescent labeling processing.  
Brain slices were labeled by ballistic delivery of fluorescent dye DiI (Molecular Probes) 
using a gene gun apparatus (Helios Gene Gun System, Bio-Rad) as described previously 
(Gan et al, 2009) and postfixed with PFA for 4 h at room temperature to further preserve 
structures and to allow the diffusion of the dye DiI. Sections were placed on microscope 
gelatine-coated slides and coverslipped with mounting medium (Mowiol). Images were 
acquired using a confocal microscope (Leica TCS Sp5 STED) with a glycerol immersion 
 14 
 
lens (63X/1.30). Individual pyramidal neurons from the BLA were chosen for spine 
analysis based on several criteria, as previously described (Saravia et al, 2017). Briefly, 
(i) there was minimal or no overlap with other labeled cells to ensure that processes from 
different cells would not be confused, (ii) at least 3 primary dendrites needed to be visible 
for cells to be used for analysis and (iii) distal dendrites (from secondary dendrites to 
terminal dendrites) were examined. In addition, we chose only one apical or basal dendrite 
per neuron and quantified a minimum of 6 dendrites per animal. To calculate spine 
density, a minimum dendrite length of 20 μm long was required. All images of dendrites 
were taken at different z levels (0.13 μm depth intervals) to examine the morphology of 
dendritic spines. Reconstruction of dendrites and spine classification was performed 
using the IMARIS software (Bitplane). Protrusions from dendrites were classified into 5 
types based on their morphology: class 1 or stubby protuberances were 0.5 μm in length, 
lacked a large spine head, and did not appear to have a neck; class 2, or mushroom-shaped 
spines were between 0.5 and 1.25 μm in length and were characterized by a short neck 
and large spine head; class 3, or thin spines ranged between 1.25 and 3.0 μm and had 
elongated spine necks with small heads; class 4, or filipodia were 1.0 and 2.5 μm in length 
and were characterized by a large neck without spine head; and class 5 or branched spine 
ranged between 1.25 and 3.0 μm and had elongated spine necks with 2 or more spine 
heads.  Quantification of dendritic spine densities was performed in blind conditions. 
 
2.11. Data Analysis 
Data were analyzed by using unpaired Student t-test, two-way ANOVA or two-way 
ANOVA with repeated measures followed by subsequent post hoc analysis (Fisher LSD) 
when required. The Pearson correlation coefficient was used to analyse the relationship 
 15 
 
between cFos expression and freezing values. A p value < 0.05 was used to determine 
statistical significance. The statistical analysis was performed using STATISTICA 
(StatSoft) software.

3. Results 
3.1. Adolescent THC treatment does not modify fear extinction in adulthood 
Adolescent male mice were treated with increasing doses of THC during 15 days (PND 
35-39: 3 mg/kg, PND 40-44: 6 mg/kg, and PND 45-49: 12 mg/kg). Body weight was 
daily evaluated along THC treatment. When mice reached adulthood, the effects of 
adolescent THC administration on fear memory processing were analyzed (Fig. 1A). 
Possible changes in locomotor activity and anxiety-like behaviour were also examined 
(Fig. 1A). The weight gain of mice treated with THC was lower than those exposed to 
vehicle (Fig. 1B), as previously reported (Rubino et al., 2008; Stopponi et al., 2014; 
Scherma et al, 2016). An anxiogenic-like effect induced by a high dose of THC could 
explain the changes in body weight. Indeed, one week after the finishing of the treatment, 
a higher level of anxiety-like behaviour in adolescent rodents exposed to THC compared 
to controls was found in the elevated plus maze (EPM) test in previous studies (Stopponi 
et al., 2014). Non-specific inhibition of ingestion, secondary to the sedative effects of 
THC could also be involved in this effect on body weight. Locomotor activity (p=0.96, 
Student t test) (Fig. 1C) and anxiety-like responses (p=0.44, Student t test) (Fig. 1D) (Fig. 
S2A) of adult mice were not affected by the chronic treatment with THC. The 
administration of THC did not modify the acquisition of fear memory as shown by similar 
freezing behaviour in both contextual (p=0.94, Student t test) and cued (p=0.78, Student 
t test) fear conditioning tests (Fig. 1E and F (Session1)). In addition, cued fear extinction 
was similar in adult animals exposed to THC or vehicle (Fig. 1F). Thus, two-way 
ANOVA of repeated measures showed no interaction between THC treatment and day 
(F5,130=1.22, p=0.30) (Fig. 1F).  
In an additional experiment, fear memory processing was not modified either in female 
mice (Fig. S1), in spite of the different sensitivity observed in several behavioural 
 17 
 
responses after treatment with cannabinoid agonists between sexes (Rubino and Parolaro, 
2011). Our results indicate that THC administration during adolescence does not alter 
locomotion, anxiety and fear memory processing in adult male and female mice. 
 
3.2. Concomitant THC and stress exposure during adolescence impairs fear 
extinction in adulthood 
Cannabis consumption and environmental factors, such as stressful events, often coexist 
during adolescence and these factors could exacerbate the detrimental effects of cannabis 
use in adulthood. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the consequences of simultaneous 
adolescent THC and stress exposure on locomotion, anxiety-like behaviour and fear 
memory processing in adult male mice. For this purpose, one stressor was applied at the 
end of each THC exposure period as shown in Fig. 2A. Two additional stress exposures 
were applied before behavioural evaluation (Fig. 2A). Adolescent mice receiving THC, 
independently of stress exposure, showed again a significant resistance to gain weight 
(Fig. 2B). Locomotor activity during adulthood was not modified by THC treatment, 
stress exposure or by the interaction of both factors (Fig. 2C). Mice that underwent stress, 
independently of THC exposure, showed an increase in anxiety-like behaviour. Thus, 
adolescent stressed mice spent significantly less time in open arms in the EPM (stress 
effect: F1,60=4.17, p<0.05) (Fig. 2D), without significant interaction between THC and 
stress. This effect was not due to differences in the total number of entries (Fig. S2B). 
The acquisition of fear memory was not altered in adult mice exposed to stress, THC or 
both factors simultaneously during adolescence. Thus, freezing levels were similar in 
both contextual (F1,58=2.62, NS) and cued (F1,59=2.69, NS) fear conditioning tests (Fig. 
2E and F (S1)). Notably, concomitant THC and stress exposure impaired cued fear 
 18 
 
extinction (Fig. 2F). Two-way ANOVA with repeated measures revealed a significant 
interaction between THC and stress (F1,59=9.38, p<0.01), without other two-way or three-
way interactions. Two-way ANOVA analyzed for each individual session revealed a 
significant interaction between stress and THC from session 4 to session 6 (F1,59=10.26, 
p<0.01 at session 4; F1,59=5.45, p<0.05 at session 5; F1,59=15.56, p<0.01 at session 6). 
Subsequent post hoc analysis showed higher freezing levels in mice simultaneously 
exposed to THC and stress in comparison with those treated with THC (p<0.05 at session 
5; p<0.01 at session 4 and 6), exposed to stress (p<0.01 at session 4, 5 and 6), and vehicle 
non-stress mice (p<0.01 at session 4 and 6; p<0.05 at session 5) (Fig. 2F). In agreement, 
freezing levels expressed as AUC (Fig. 2G) were higher in mice exposed simultaneously 
to THC and stress in comparison with the other experimental conditions, as revealed by 
two-way ANOVA (interaction THC x stress: F1,59=8.51, p<0.01) and post hoc analysis 
(p<0.01). We next evaluated whether the impairment in cued fear extinction could be 
related to an alteration of CB1R levels in the amygdala. CB1R in this brain region plays 
a crucial role in the modulation of fear processing (Gunduz-Cinar et al., 2013). Western 
blot analysis showed no differences in total CB1R levels in the amygdala of adult mice 
exposed to THC and/or stress during the adolescent period (interaction THC x stress: 
F1,19=1.99, p=0.17) (Fig. S3). This result suggests that, under our experimental 
conditions, impairment in fear extinction is not influenced by a reduced expression of 
CB1R in the amygdala of adult animals. However, changes in the efficacy or efficiency 
of the receptor binding can occur independently from the status of the receptor density, 
contributing to the observed phenotype.  
To elucidate whether immature brain represents a period of development more 
susceptible to the effects of THC and stress, we compared the consequences of exposing 
the same type of stressors and THC treatment during adolescence and adulthood period 
 19 
 
(Fig. S4A). For this purpose, changes in behaviour in adult male animals were evaluated 
exactly 20 days following the final day of THC administration (Fig. S4A), as previously 
studied after exposure during the adolescent period. Notably, no differences in cued fear 
processing were observed between the different experimental groups exposed to THC 
and/or stress in adulthood period (Fig. S4B and C), suggesting that adolescence is a 
sensitive window for the harmful consequences of concomitant THC and stress exposure.  
  
3.3. Concomitant THC and stress exposure during adolescence increases 
corticosterone levels following cued fear conditioning session  
Stress during early-stages can impair fear extinction by modulation of glucocorticoid 
activity (Green et al, 2011). Therefore, we next evaluated possible changes in plasma 
corticosterone levels due to THC and stress exposure during adolescence at different time 
points (Fig. 3A). Corticosterone levels measured immediately after restraint stress 
exposure were significantly increased in stressed mice (stress effect: F1,27=300.43, 
p<0.01) (Fig. 3B), without influence of THC treatment (Veh-non stress: 68.38 ± 8.8 
ng/ml; Veh-stress: 333.57 ± 11.57 ng/ml; THC-non stress: 82.25 ± 19.44; THC-stress: 
365.38 ± 19.12 ng/ml). Basal levels of corticosterone after previous THC and stress 
exposure (PND 67) were unaltered in the different experimental groups (Fig. S5). 
Corticosterone levels measured 30 min after fear conditioning training were higher than 
in basal conditions, but remained similar in all experimental groups (Fig. 3C). 
Interestingly, previous simultaneous exposure to THC and stress increased plasma 
corticosterone 30 min after cued fear conditioning testing, as shown by two-way ANOVA 
(interaction treatment x stress: F1,27=5.76, p<0.05) (Fig. 3D), and post hoc analysis 
(p<0.01, THC-stress (132.88 ± 8.06 ng/ml) versus THC-non stress mice (89.13 ± 5.33 
 20 
 
ng/ml) (Fig. 3D). This imbalance of corticosterone activity was temporal since similar 
levels were again observed after the fifth cued extinction session (Fig. 3E). These results 
suggest that glucocorticoid sensitization after cued fear conditioning may contribute to 
the extinction deficits revealed in mice exposed to THC and stress during the adolescent 
period.  
 
3.4. Impaired fear extinction induced by concomitant THC and stress exposure is 
associated with reduced activity of the infralimbic prefrontal cortex and the 
basolateral amygdala 
To identify the brain areas responsible for the resistance to fear extinction induced by 
simultaneous THC and stress exposure, we analyzed the possible activation of brain 
regions closely involved in the extinction circuit by using cFos immunofluorescence. 
cFos expression in the PL, IL and BLA was evaluated 2 h after the last cued fear extinction 
session, as behavioural alteration remained present at this time point. cFos expression in 
the PL was not altered in the different experimental groups (F1,20=1.05, NS) (Fig. S6). 
Interestingly, IL activation was reduced by the previous concomitant exposure to THC 
and stress (p<0.01), as shown by two-way ANOVA (interaction treatment x stress 
F1,32=6.70, p<0.05) (Fig. 4A and B). Values of cFos expression in the IL for the different 
experimental groups were the following: Veh-non stress: 247.10 ± 16.10 cFos+ 
cells/mm2; Veh-stress: 249.47 ± 25.36 cFos+ cells/mm2; THC-non stress: 253.76 ± 8.92 
cFos+ cells/mm2; THC-stress: 171.00 ± 12.16 cFos+ cells/mm2). Likewise, simultaneous 
THC and stress adolescent exposure reduced the activity of the BLA as revealed by two-
way ANOVA (interaction treatment x stress F1,28=4.51, p<0.05), and post hoc analysis 
(p<0.05) (Fig. 4C and D). Values of cFos expression in the BLA for the different 
 21 
 
experimental groups were the following: Veh-non stress: 144.03 ± 12.21 cFos+ 
cells/mm2; Veh-stress: 149.97 ± 14.12 cFos+ cells/mm2; THC-non stress: 138.60 ± 7.98 
cFos+ cells/mm2; THC-stress: 108.83 ± 9.75 cFos+ cells/mm2). These results show that 
the impaired fear extinction induced by adolescent THC and stress exposure is associated 
with reduced activity of the IL and the BLA, which are key regions involved in the 
extinction of aversive memories. Indeed, a significant negative correlation (p<0.05) 
between fear memory (freezing values) and IL activity (density of cFos+ cells) was 
observed (Fig. 4E), whereas a clear tendency (p=0.058) was revealed in the BLA (Fig. 
4F). In an additional experiment cFos expression was analyzed in the BLA and the IL in 
adult mice exposed to THC and stress during the adolescence just before and after the 
fear conditioning and extinction paradigm. These experiments were carried out in order 
to investigate whether the reduction in the activity of these brain areas was due to the 
THC-stress treatment or if these changes were influenced by the dynamic interplay among 
THC, stress and fear conditioning/extinction. Simultaneous THC and stress adolescent 
exposure reduced the activity of the BLA (interaction THC x stress: F1,23=9.52, p<0.05) 
(Fig. S7A) and the IL (interaction THC x stress: F1,22=5.66, p<0.05) (Fig S7B) after cued 
fear extinction, as previously reported. Interestingly, cFos expression was higher in adult 
animals exposed to THC and stress during the adolescence that did not undergo fear 
conditioning/extinction in both the BLA (p<0.05) (Fig. S7A) and the IL (p<0.01) (Fig 
S7B) in comparison with mice that followed the behavioural paradigm. These results 
suggest that the reduced activity observed in the BLA and the IL depends on the dynamic 
effect of THC-stress exposure followed by fear conditioning and extinction behavioural 
testing.     
 
 22 
 
3.5. Impaired fear extinction induced by concomitant THC and stress exposure is 
associated with structural plasticity alterations in the basolateral amygdala  
Stress has been reported to alter structural plasticity in the amygdala (Leuner and Shors, 
2013), affect fear extinction (Maren and Holmes, 2016), and THC exposure during 
adolescence can induce changes in dendritic spines in several brain regions (Rubino and 
Parolaro, 2016). Given the crucial role played by the BLA in fear extinction, we 
investigated whether concomitant exposure to THC and stress could affect structural 
plasticity in this brain area. Mice were sacrificed after the last cued extinction session and 
brains were processed for ballistic delivery to label whole neurons with the dye DiI. Total 
dendritic spine density of BLA pyramidal neurons was not modified by THC, stress or by 
the combination of both factors (Fig. 5A). Dendritic spines are dynamic and can be 
classified into different categories depending on their morphology (stubby, mushroom, 
thin, branched and filopodia). Density of mushroom (mature) spines was reduced in 
adolescent mice treated with THC (independently of stress exposure) (p<0.01), as 
revealed by two-way ANOVA (treatment effect: F1,23=9.35, p<0.01) (Fig. 5B and C). 
THC treatment increased the density of thin (immature) spines (treatment effect: 
F1,23=7.43 p<0.05) (Fig. 5B and C). Notably, this effect was mainly due to the 
concomitant exposure to THC and stress as revealed by post hoc comparisons. Thus, 
THC-stress mice showed higher density of thin spines in comparison with THC-non stress 
(p<0.05), vehicle-stress (p<0.05), and vehicle-non stress (p<0.01) mice (Fig. 5B and C).  
These data suggest that changes in the density of immature spines in the BLA might be 
involved in the impairment of fear extinction associated with the combination of THC 
and stress exposure during the adolescence.

4. Discussion 
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating synergistic detrimental 
effects of simultaneous adolescent THC and stress exposure on the extinction of aversive 
memory in adulthood. Notably, impaired fear extinction was associated with a temporal 
imbalance of plasmatic corticosterone levels, decreased activity of key regions involved 
in fear regulation, such as the IL and the BLA, and changes in structural plasticity 
revealed by increased immature dendritic spines density in pyramidal neurons of the 
BLA.  
The administration of THC during adolescence in male and female mice did not induce 
any modification in locomotor activity, anxiety-like responses, and fear regulation later 
in life. Controversial results have been previously reported after adolescent THC 
exposure since general anxiety by using EPM was not modified in adult rats (Rubino et 
al, 2008; Cadoni et al, 2015), whereas an anxiogenic-like effect was revealed in adult 
CD1 mice (Murphy et al, 2017). In agreement with our data, no lasting effects by 
adolescent THC exposure were previously observed in aversive memory as revealed by 
the lack of deficits in passive avoidance task (Rubino et al, 2009a; Rubino et al, 2009b) 
or cued and contextual fear conditioning (Ballinger et al, 2015). However, a long-lasting 
impairment of fear conditioning has been described after chronic administration of the 
synthetic cannabinoid WIN 55,212-2 during adolescence (Gleason et al, 2012; Tomas-
Roig et al, 2017), which has a higher intrinsic activity on cannabinoid receptors than THC 
(Kuster et al, 1993). On the other hand, repeated adolescent CB1R antagonism induced 
greater contextual fear memory recall in adult female, but not male, rats in comparison 
with control animals (Simone et al, 2018b). Fear extinction, which has not been 
 24 
 
previously evaluated, was not affected in either male or female mice by adolescent THC 
treatment under our experimental conditions.  
Although the exact cause of most psychiatric illnesses is not well known, it is becoming 
clear that many of these conditions are caused by the combination of genetic and 
environmental factors or by the association between different environmental events 
(Caspi and Moffit, 2006; Rubino and Parolaro, 2016). Stress has a critical role in the 
development of many psychiatric conditions including trauma-related disorders (Maren 
and Holmes, 2016). Fear extinction deficits have been reported following exposure to 
various types of stressors in either animal models (Maren and Holmes, 2016) or humans 
(Hartley et al, 2014). Thus, adolescent rodents exposed to chronic stress usually show 
impaired extinction when tested as adults (Judo et al, 2010; Ishikawa et al, 2012; Toledo-
Rodriguez et al, 2012; Skelly et al, 2015), although different results have been reported 
depending on the sex and the modality, chronicity and precise timing of stress exposure 
during adolescence (Morrissey et al, 2011; McCormick et al, 2013; Schayek and Maroun, 
2015; Deng et al, 2017). We found that adolescent stress exposure enhanced anxiety-like 
behaviour, but did not modify fear conditioning in adult mice. In contrast, concomitant 
adolescent THC and stress exposure induced an impairment of fear extinction in 
adulthood without affecting the acquisition of fear memory or general anxiety. Notably, 
the effect of this THC/stress exposure was age-dependent as revealed by the lack of 
deficits in fear extinction when the same exposure was performed directly in adulthood. 
Impaired extinction was not observed by the individual exposition to each factor 
suggesting synergistic detrimental consequences of adolescent cannabis and stressful 
events. In this regard, chronic adolescent treatment with THC induced a deficit in cued 
fear conditioning only in adult mice with a mutation in disrupted-in-schizophrenia 1 gene 
 25 
 
(Ballinger et al, 2015), although the influence of this genetic and environmental 
interaction in fear extinction was not evaluated in this study.   
Animals simultaneously exposed to THC and stress during adolescence showed a 
temporal imbalance of plasmatic corticosterone levels in the adult period as revealed by 
the increase of this hormone following the cued fear conditioning session. Although the 
association between glucocorticoids and fear extinction is complex, this enhancement of 
the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity could participate in the extinction 
deficits and changes in structural plasticity revealed in our study. Thus, a single exposure 
to immobilization stress in adult male mice activates the HPA axis by increasing 
corticosterone plasma levels (Andero et al, 2011). A week after this stress exposure mice 
present impaired cued-fear extinction and enhanced levels of corticosterone after both 
fear acquisition and fear extinction (Sawamura et al, 2016). Moreover, acute 
corticosterone administration in adult rats induced dendritic hypertrophy of BLA neurons 
and enhanced anxiety 12 days after the treatment (Mitra and Sapolsky, 2008; Kim et al, 
2014). 
IL and BLA are key structures involved in the neurobiological substrate underlying fear 
extinction (Sierra-Mercado et al, 2011). IL facilitates the activation of the subpopulation 
of BLA neurons directly involved in fear extinction (Herry et al, 2008). Several studies 
evaluating immediately-early gene (IEG) expression conclude that impaired fear 
extinction is associated with reduced activity of the cortico-amygdala circuit (Herry and 
Mons, 2004; Holmes and Singewald, 2013), while increased IEG levels in those brain 
areas is related to a complete extinction of conditioned fear (Herry and Mons, 2004; 
Flores et al, 2014). Notably, our data reveal a reduced cFos expression in the IL and the 
BLA in adult mice simultaneously exposed to THC and stress during the adolescent 
 26 
 
period suggesting the existence of a long-lasting dysregulation of the fear circuit. In 
contrast, PL activity was not modified consistent with a role for this brain area in fear 
expression, but not extinction (Sierra-Mercado et al, 2011). Besides these modifications 
on brain region activity, we found structural plasticity changes in pyramidal neurons of 
the BLA in adulthood as a consequence of adolescent THC treatment, alone or in 
combination with stress. A decrease of mushroom (matures) dendritic spines was revealed 
in mice previously exposed to THC congruent with previous studies showing reduced 
spine density in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus (Rubino et al, 2009b) and the 
prefrontal cortex (Rubino et al, 2015) of adult male and female rats, respectively. 
Interestingly, simultaneous adolescent THC and stress exposure induced an increase of 
thin (immatures) spines in pyramidal neurons of the BLA in adult mice. These dendritic 
morphology modifications in BLA neurons associated with the decreased activity of this 
nucleus could be responsible of the deficits in the extinction of aversive memories. In 
agreement, fear extinction deficits following acute stress have been related to dendritic 
retraction in pyramidal neurons of both BLA (Maroun et al, 2013) and IL (Moench et al, 
2016).   
In summary, our data show lasting neurobiological changes associated with resistance to 
fear extinction due to concomitant adolescent THC and stress exposure. This study 
identifies a potential social group highly vulnerable to develop anxiety disorders 
characterized by pathological fear after cannabis consumption, which contains multitude 
bioactive compounds (ElSohly et al, 2017). Although our study was performed using pure 
THC, significantly higher THC concentrations in cannabis derived extracts over the years 
have been reported (Cascini et al, 2012; ElSohly et al, 2016), which could cause an 
increase of the total amount of THC consumed. This increase poses higher risk of 
cannabis use, particularly among adolescents (ElSohly et al, 2016). Taking into account 
 27 
 
the high rate of cannabis intake during this period which usually entails stressful events, 
the combination of both factors may increase the risk to suffer anxiety disorders in the 
adult period. Indeed, the exposure to stressful events during adolescence that often occur 
in cannabis consumers may represent an important risk factor to suffer anxiety disorders 
in adulthood.
