ABSTRACT
Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists are potent enhancers of innate antiviral immunity and may also reverse HIV-1 latency. There-
fore, TLR agonists have a potential role in the context of a “shock-and-kill” approach to eradicate HIV-1. Our extensive preclini-
cal evaluation suggests that a novel TLR9 agonist, MGN1703, may indeed perform both functions in an HIV-1 eradication trial.
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from aviremic HIV-1-infected donors on antiretroviral therapy (ART) that were
incubated with MGN1703 ex vivo exhibited increased secretion of interferon alpha (IFN-�) (P � 0.005) and CXCL10 (P �
0.0005) in culture supernatants. Within the incubated PBMC pool, there were higher proportions of CD69-positive CD56dim
CD16� NK cells (P � 0.001) as well as higher proportions of CD107a-positive (P � 0.002) and IFN-�-producing (P � 0.038) NK
cells. Incubation with MGN1703 also increased the proportions of CD69-expressing CD4� and CD8� T cells. Furthermore,
CD4� T cells within the pool of MGN1703-incubated PBMCs showed enhanced levels of unspliced HIV-1 RNA (P � 0.036). Im-
portantly, MGN1703 increased the capacity of NK cells to inhibit virus spread within a culture of autologous CD4� T cells as-
sessed by using an HIV-1 p24 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (P � 0.03). In conclusion, we show that MGN1703
induced strong antiviral innate immune responses, enhanced HIV-1 transcription, and boosted NK cell-mediated suppression of
HIV-1 infection in autologous CD4� T cells. These findings support clinical testing of MGN1703 in HIV-1 eradication trials.
IMPORTANCE
We demonstrate that MGN1703 (a TLR9 agonist currently undergoing phase 3 clinical testing for the treatment of metastatic
colorectal cancer) induces potent antiviral responses in immune effector cells from HIV-1-infected individuals on suppressive
antiretroviral therapy. The significantly improved safety and tolerability profiles of MGN1703 versus TLR9 agonists of the CpG-
oligodeoxynucleotide (CpG-ODN) family are due to its novel “dumbbell-shape” structure made of covalently closed, natural
DNA. In our study, we found that incubation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with MGN1703 results in natural killer cell
activation and increased natural killer cell function, which significantly inhibited the spread of HIV in a culture of autologous
CD4� T cells. Furthermore, we discovered that MGN1703-mediated activation can enhance HIV-1 transcription in CD4� T cells,
suggesting that this molecule may serve a dual purpose in HIV-1 eradication therapy: enhanced immune function and latency
reversal. These findings provide a strong preclinical basis for the inclusion of MGN1703 in an HIV eradication clinical trial.
E
ffector cells of the innate immune system (e.g., natural killer
[NK] cells and natural killer T [NKT] cells) possess the poten-
tial to mount a rapid and potent response toward viral challenges.
Over the past decade, the importance of NK cells in controlling
human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in vivo
has become increasingly clearer (1–3). In response, novel ap-
proaches to induce NK cell-directed enhancement of immune
function are being developed (4). One approach to improving NK
cell function is via Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) activation.
TLR9 ligands stimulate potent antiviral responses via an acti-
vation pathway initiated by the TLR9 recognition of nonmethy-
lated cytosine-guanine dinucleotide (CG) motifs found in bacte-
rial, viral, and mitochondrial DNAs (5). This pathway is initiated
by pattern recognition in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and
B cells, as these cells exhibit high levels of TLR9 expression. Fol-
lowing TLR9 engagement, type I interferon (primarily interferon
alpha [IFN-�]) is produced and secreted by pDCs. IFN-� activates
NK cells as well as the promoters of interferon-stimulated genes
(e.g., CXCL-10), resulting in a targeted antiviral inflammatory
environment. T and NK cells within this local environment be-
come further activated (e.g., upregulated CD69 surface expression
on NK and T cells and altered expression of NK cell receptors) (6).
The overall function of activated T and NK cells is to clear the
pathogen that initiated the cascade in the TLR9-expressing cells.

 MGN1703 is a novel, dumbbell-shaped, covalently closed
DNA construct, synthesized from nonmodified natural DNA, that
we used to agonize TLR9 (7–9), and we refer to cells activated via
this TLR9-triggered pathway as “MGN1703-activated” cells here.
We previously examined the effect of a class B oligodeoxy-
nucleotide of the CpG-oligodeoxynucleotide (CpG-ODN) mo-
lecular family of TLR9 agonists in HIV-1-infected individuals as a
vaccine adjuvant and observed increased levels of antigen-specific
antibodies (10). Interestingly, participants randomized to TLR9-
adjuvanted immunization had a minor but significant decrease in
the HIV-1 proviral reservoir compared to those receiving immu-
nization not adjuvanted by TLR9 activation (11). This unexpected
finding led us to further investigate the potential impact of TLR9
activation on immune cells from HIV-infected individuals. How-
ever, the significant toxicity associated with treatment with such a
CpG-ODN is a significant barrier to clinical development (10, 12,
13). The phosphorothioate backbone that prevents nuclease-me-
diated degradation of CpG-ODN molecules has off-target immu-
nostimulatory effects, which may increase and/or worsen adverse
events (14). Because MGN1703’s unique structure, comprising
only natural DNA, obviates the need for such chemical modifica-
tions, MGN1703 has an excellent safety profile, which has been
demonstrated during clinical testing (15, 16).
The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that
MGN1703 may have dual favorable effects in the context of a
“shock-and-kill” HIV-1 eradication approach (17–21).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Reagents. MGN1703 (dSLIM-30L1, i.e., double-stem-loop immuno-
modulator 30L1, as an active ingredient) and noCG-MGN1703 (both
from Mologen AG, Berlin, Germany) were used. The noCG-MGN1703
molecule, which is otherwise identical to MGN1703, does not contain the
CG motifs triggering TLR9 (and thus served as a negative control for the
potential non-CG-specific effects of MGN1703). CpG-ODN2006 (class B
CpG-ODN human TLR9 agonist) (InvivoGen, Denmark) and panobi-
nostat (LBH589) (Selleck Chemicals, USA) were also used.
Donors and PBMCs. This study was approved by the Research Ethics
Committee of the Central Denmark Region (reference no. 37852). All
donors provided written informed consent prior to sample collection.
Our a priori goal with this study was to investigate the immunomodula-
tory effect of MGN1703 on HIV-infected individuals. Based on experi-
ments done on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from
healthy individuals (9), we designed our study using HIV donor cells to
focus primarily on determining whether MGN1703 also induced IFN-�
release and/or NK cell activation (via CD69 upregulation) in this HIV-
infected population. Our donor inclusion targets (n � 4 or 5) were there-
fore determined based on data from healthy donors. PBMCs from HIV-
1-infected donors (viral load of �50 copies/ml and CD4 count of �350)
on combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) were isolated from periph-
eral blood by using Ficoll (GE Healthcare) density separation. PBMCs
were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 2%
fetal bovine serum (FBS) and then resuspended in cRPMI (RPMI 1640
medium with L-glutamine [Gibco, Life Technologies] supplemented with
10% FBS, penicillin [100 IU/ml], and streptomycin [100 �g/ml]). Cells
were incubated for 2 h at 37°C in 5% CO2 before utilization in any assays.
HIV-1 latency reversal in ACH2 and U1 cells. The ACH2 (22) and U1
(23, 24) latently HIV-1-infected CD4� T cell lines were seeded in cRPMI
in 96-well plates (Nunc, Denmark). Cells (2 � 105 cells/well) were coin-
cubated with MGN1703, CpG-ODN2006, or culture supernatants from
MGN1703-stimulated PBMCs for 48 h in triplicates. Virus was inacti-
vated with 1% Empigen (Albright & Wilson UK Ltd.), and an HIV-1 p24
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed on super-
natants and lysates as described previously (25).
Activation of NK cells and T cells. PBMCs were incubated with vari-
ous concentrations of MGN1703 for 48 h in triplicates. cRPMI alone was
used as a reference, and noCG-MGN1703 was used as a non-TLR9-spe-
cific control. Cells were pooled; washed; and stained with NearIR-Live/
Dead (Invitrogen), CD3-phycoerythrin (PE) (BioLegend), CD14-allo-
phycocyanin (APC) (M5E2; BioLegend), CD16-peridinin chlorophyll
protein (PerCP)-Cy5.5 (3G8; BD Pharmingen), CD56-BV421 (HCD56;
BioLegend), CD8-BV605 (BioLegend), CD25-fluorescein isothiocyanate
(FITC) (BD Biosciences), and CD69-PC7 (FN50; BioLegend). All cells
were gated as live, single lymphocytes; NK cells were further gated as
CD14neg CD3neg and either CD56dim CD16�, CD56bright, or CD56neg
CD16�. Due to the downregulation of CD4, CD4� T cells were defined
as CD3� CD8neg CD14neg. CD8� T cells were defined as CD3� CD8�
CD14neg. Fluorescence-minus-one (FMO) controls were used to define
positive gates for CD16, CD56, CD25, and CD69.
Expression of NK cell receptors. PBMCs were incubated with the
indicated concentrations of MGN1703 for 48 h in triplicates. Cells were
pooled; washed; and stained with NearIR-Live/Dead (Invitrogen),
CD3-PE (BioLegend), CD14-APC (M5E2; BioLegend), CD16-PerCP-
Cy5.5 (3G8; BD Pharmingen), CD56-BV421 (HCD56; BioLegend),
CD335-BV605 (NKp46) (BioLegend), CD161-FITC (NKR-P1A) (Bio-
Legend), and CD159a-PC7 (NKG2A) (Beckman Coulter). FMO controls
were used to define positive gates for CD16, CD56, CD335, CD159a, and
CD161.
Cytokine measurements. Levels of cytokines and chemokines in cul-
ture supernatants (duplicates) were measured by using electrochemilu-
minescence-based multiplex technology assays (V-Plex custom human
cytokine, catalog no. K151A0H-1, and Ultra-Sensitive human IFN-
alpha2a, catalog no. K151ACC-1; Meso Scale Diagnostics, USA) as rec-
ommended by the manufacturer.
Ex vivo induction of HIV-1 usRNA transcription. PBMCs were in-
cubated for 16 h with the indicated concentrations of MGN1703, CpG-
ODN2006, panobinostat, or cRPMI alone in triplicates. Following incu-
bation, CD4� T cells were isolated by negative magnetic selection (catalog
no. 130-096-533; Miltenyi Biotec), and RNA was extracted by using a
High Pure RNA isolation kit (catalog no. 11828665001; Roche), both
according to the manufacturers’ instructions. HIV-1 unspliced RNA
(usRNA) was measured by using a seminested reverse transcription-
quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) procedure modified a procedure described
previously by Lewin et al. (26), performed in triplicates with the following
primers: MH535 (first-round forward 3= long terminal repeat [LTR])
(5=-AACTAGGGAACCCACTGCTTAAG-3=), SL19 (second unspliced
forward) (5=-TCTCTAGCAGTGGCGCCCGAACA-3=), and SL20 (un-
spliced reverse) (5=-TCTCCTTCTAGCCTCCGCTAGTC-3=). Melting-
curve analysis was performed to check the specificity of amplification. 18S
rRNA was used as a reference gene to normalize the initial cell input. We
used HIV-1 usRNA as a measure of latency reversal for primary CD4� T
cells. We chose this measure because there are low numbers of latently
infected cells, meaning that HIV-1 p24 antigen levels in supernatants
would not be quantifiable poststimulation.
NK cell degranulation and intracellular IFN-� production. CD107a
lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP-1) expression was used
as a marker for NK cell degranulation. PBMCs were incubated with
MGN1703, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or cRPMI only for 48 h in triplicates
(occasionally duplicates if not enough cells were available) and then
washed twice before being cultured alone or with HLA class I-deficient
K562 target cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) at an
effector-to-target cell ratio of 1:1 for 6 h in the presence of 4 �g/ml brefel-
din A (Sigma-Aldrich), Golgi Stop (BD Biosciences, USA), and CD107a-
APC (BD Biosciences). Cells were then collected, washed twice, and
stained additionally with NearIR-Live/Dead (Invitrogen), CD3-PE (Bio-
Legend), CD14-PC7 (M5E2; BD Biosciences), CD16-PerCP-Cy5.5 (3G8;
BD Pharmingen), and CD56-BV421 (HCD56; BioLegend). Cells were
washed twice and then fixed and permeabilized with BD Cytofix/Cy-
toperm (BD Biosciences), followed by intracellular IFN-�–FITC

 (25723.11; BD Biosciences). NK cells were gated as live, single, CD14neg
CD3neg CD56� lymphocytes. FMO controls were used to set gates for
CD56, CD107a, and IFN-�. Cells cultured without target cells (see Fig. 6A,
top) were used to measure unspecific background degranulation and
IFN-� production, and values were subtracted from values for target cell
stimulations for individual donors.

activated with 1% phytohemagglutinin (catalog no. 10576-015; Gibco)
for 1 day. Cells were washed and then cultured in the presence of 50 U/ml
interleukin-2 (IL-2) for two additional days. Simultaneously, PBMCs
were rested overnight before being incubated with MGN1703 (3 �M) for
48 h, and NK cells were subsequently purified via negative selection (cat-
alog no. 19055; StemCell Technologies). On day 0, activated CD4� T cells
were cultured with HIV-1 (HXB2D) (27) (multiplicity of infection of
0.01) for 4 h, washed 3 times, and rested overnight. On the next day, CD4�
T cells and NK cells were washed, counted, and cocultured (1:1 or CD4
only) in triplicates in 96-well plates. Culture supernatants were collected
on days 1, 3, and 5, and HIV-1 p24 antigen was measured by an ELISA as
previously described (25). Cells from day 5 were collected; stained with
NearIR-Live/Dead (Invitrogen), CD3-BV421 (OKT3; BioLegend), and

 sequently stained for intracellular HIV-1 p24-RD1 core antigen (KC57;
Beckman Coulter). CD4� T cells were defined as live, single, CD14neg
CD3� CD8neg lymphocytes. Gates for p24 positivity were set by using the
FMO control.
Flow cytometric acquisition and analyses. All samples were acquired
on a FACSVerse instrument (BD Biosciences, USA), and data analyses
were performed by using FlowJo software (v. 10.0.8) (TreeStar, Inc.,
USA).
Statistics. A paired t test on log-transformed absolute data was used
for comparing treatment conditions. As fold changes already reflect
paired data, fold changes were analyzed by using a one-sample t test, also
on log-transformed data. For easier interpretation of the results by the
reader, we portray the actual values and fold changes in the graphs rather
than the log-transformed data. Comparisons to untreated samples were
performed. All statistical analyses and graphs were made by using Graph-
Pad Prism (v.6.0f) (GraphPad Software, Inc., USA).
RESULTS
Cytokine release from PBMCs following incubation with
MGN1703. Since TLR9 is primarily expressed on pDCs and B
cells, the activation of NK and T cells by TLR9 ligands is mediated
indirectly via cytokine release and cell-cell contact (reviewed in
reference 28). Therefore, we first measured cytokine release from
PBMCs incubated ex vivo with MGN1703 (Fig. 1). We found that
MGN1703 induced IFN-� (P � 0.005) and CXCL10 (P � 0.0005)
from PBMCs and that the magnitude of the response varied be-
tween human donors. Importantly, when we quantified the levels
of IL-2, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-�), we did not
detect evidence of a global inflammatory response, although
TNF-� was slightly induced (P � 0.007). In contrast, exposure of
PBMCs to either CpG-ODN2006 or low-dose LPS induced very
high levels of IL-6 and TNF-� (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental
material). Collectively, the observed cytokine induction patterns
suggest that MGN1703-mediated activation induces a potent type
I interferon response in most donors but does not induce a broad
inflammatory response in cultures from any donor. This is an
important observation from a safety perspective.
Activation of primary NK cells and T cells by MGN1703.
Next, we investigated the impact of MGN1703-mediated activa-
tion on the activation of specific NK and T cell subsets. The pro-
portion of CD69-positive CD56dim (CD56dim CD16�) NK cells
increased 7.5-fold (P � 0.004) in response to MGN1703. Also,
CD56bright (CD56bright CD16�/�) and CD56neg (CD56neg CD16�)
NK cells increased the proportion of CD69-positive cells by 2.2-
fold (P � 0.02) and 5-fold (P � 0.005), respectively (Fig. 2A to C).
Also, CpG-ODN2006 increased the proportions of CD69�
CD56dim (P � 0.004) and CD56neg NK cells (P � 0.01) (see Fig.
S2B and S2C in the supplemental material). Similarly, the propor-
tions of activated CD4� and CD8� T cells were also significantly
increased following incubation with MGN1703 (Fig. 2D to F),
whereas the expression of CD25 on CD4� T cells was unchanged
(Fig. 2G). Together, these findings confirm that MGN1703 acti-
vates the specific immune effector cells that play a role in the
control of HIV-1 infection.
MGN1703-mediated upregulation of NK cell receptors
NKp46andNKG2A.Followingtheobservedincreasesinlympho-
cyte activation, we next investigated whether the proportions of
NK cells expressing activating (e.g., NKp46) or inhibitory (e.g.,
NKG2A) receptors were altered by MGN1703, assuming that an
activated phenotype could augment killing of HIV-1-infected
CD4� T cells. On CD56dim NK cells, the primary effector NK cells
(29), we observed a significant increase in the number of NKp46-
expressing cells (P � 0.049) (Fig. 3B). In addition, we found an
increase in the number of NKG2A-expressing cells (P � 0.01)
(Fig. 3D). In contrast, among CD56bright and CD56neg NK cell
subsets, expression levels of NKp46 and NKG2A were not altered
by MGN1703 exposure (see Fig. S3A to S3F in the supplemental
material). The percentage of NK cells expressing the activating
receptor NKR-P1A increased from 36% to 43% (P � 0.07) (Fig.
3C). CpG-ODN2006 did not alter the expression of any of the
markers on NK cells (see Fig. S4 in the supplemental material).
Thus, MGN1703-mediated activation also resulted in significantly
increased proportions of NKG2A� and NKp46� NK cells, the
latter being important for lysis of HIV-1-infected cells (30).
MGN1703-mediated activation is consistent during histone
deacetylase inhibitor coadministration. Histone deacetylase in-
hibitor (HDACi) administration has been used to reverse HIV-1
latency and increase the production of latent virus (17–21),
whereas MGN1703 may primarily be used as an immune en-
hancement therapy to augment the killing of virus-expressing
cells. However, a recent study suggested that certain HDACis
might impair cellular antiviral immune responses, with obvious
implications for their inclusion in shock-and-kill strategies (31).
Therefore, we evaluated the potential interaction between a po-
tent HDACi, panobinostat, and MGN1703 by analyzing the same
parameters as those displayed in Fig. 1 to 3. To do this, we exposed
PBMCs to MGN1703 and panobinostat simultaneously. We ex-
amined 13 different immune functions and/or activation param-
eters (e.g., IFN-� production, CXCL-10 production, and CD69
expression on NK and T cells) but did not observe any statistically
significant differences between the outcomes of MGN1703 alone
and MGN1703 plus panobinostat (Fig. 4; see also Fig. S5 in the
supplemental material). These data suggest that MGN1703 en-
hancement of immune function during a shock-and-kill eradica-
tion trial would persist during concurrent HDACi dosing.
MGN1703-enhanced HIV-1 transcription. To assess the po-
tential of TLR9 agonists to reverse HIV-1 latency, we first stimu-
lated U1 and ACH2 cells with MGN1703 but did not observe
increases in HIV-1 p24 antigen production (Fig. 5A and B). How-
ever, when we incubated PBMCs from uninfected donors with
MGN1703 and transferred the culture supernatants to U1 cells, we
found a significant increase in HIV-1 p24 production up to 2.2-
fold (P � 0.047) (Fig. 5C). Furthermore, when we assessed the
latency-reversing effect ex vivo, MGN1703 significantly enhanced
levels of HIV-1 usRNA in CD4� T cells by a median of 1.4-fold
(P � 0.036) (Fig. 5D). In comparison, panobinostat alone (7.5
nM) enhanced the transcription of usRNA by 3.3-fold and by
3.6-fold when cells were costimulated with panobinostat and
CpG-ODN2006 (see Fig. S5F in the supplemental material). In
conclusion, MGN1703 as well as CpG-ODN2006 are capable of
enhancing HIV-1 transcription in both latently infected cell lines
as well as CD4� T cells ex vivo through an indirect mechanism
although to a lesser extent than that observed following HDACi
stimulation.
NK cell degranulation and IFN-� production following
MGN1703-mediated activation. Degranulation of cytotoxic mol-
ecules by NK cells is one of the main pathways for direct killing of
target cells. Especially cells lacking major histocompatibility com-
plex class I (MHC-I) are more likely to be killed by NK cells than
cells expressing MHC-I, known as the “missing-self” hypothe-
sis (32). To further assess the immunomodulatory effects of

 MGN1703, we examined the ability of MGN1703 to increase the
degranulatory potential of NK cells, as measured by the expression
of the degranulation marker CD107a. We found that 47% more
NK cells expressed CD107a in the presence of MHC-I-deficient
K562 cells when treated with MGN1703 than when left untreated
(P � 0.002) (Fig. 6B). Furthermore, the level of intracellular
IFN-� production was 1.89-fold higher in MGN1703-activated
than in nonactivated NK cells (P � 0.038) (Fig. 6C). Although
HIV-1 is well known to downregulate MHC-I expression (33, 34),
MHC-I molecules are still expressed on CD4� T cells to some
extent, which is not the case for K562 cells. Therefore, we supple-
mented the conventional method of assessing degranulation using
K562 target cells by also using latently HIV-1-infected T cell-de-
rived ACH2 cells as targets. Like primary CD4� T cells, ACH2 cells
express MHC-I molecules that are partially downregulated upon
activation by TNF-� (35). When cocultured with latently HIV-1-
infected ACH2 cells, MGN1703-activated NK cells likewise up-
regulated CD107a by 1.86-fold compared to untreated NK cells
(P � 0.014) (Fig. 6E). Collectively, the findings suggest that
MGN1703-mediated activation increased the degranulatory and
antiviral capacity of NK cells.
MGN1703-activated NK cells mediate HIV-1-specific viral
inhibition. Having shown that NK cells are activated and exhibit a
greater
degranulatory
capacity
following
activation
with
MGN1703, we next speculated whether this TLR9 agonist treat-
ment would augment NK cell-mediated inhibition of autologous
HIV-1-infected CD4� T cells. Cultures that included MGN1703-
activated NK cells exhibited a significant reduction in virus spread
versus cultures that included nonactivated NK cells (day 5, P �
0.021) (Fig. 7A). Furthermore, we determined the percentage of
intracellular p24 HIV-1-positive CD4� T cells on day 5 and ob-
served a trend toward reduced numbers of HIV-1-positive cells in
cultures (P � 0.018) (Fig. 7B). To assess the effect of MGN1703
longitudinally, we analyzed the areas under the curves (AUCs),
which comprise p24 antigen release from day 1 through day 5. For
MGN1703-treated NK cells, the AUC comparisons showed signif-
icantly reduced levels of p24 antigen in the supernatants com-
pared to those for untreated NK cells (Fig. 7C).
DISCUSSION
Here we report a comprehensive preclinical evaluation of the
novel TLR9 agonist MGN1703 in an HIV-1 eradication context.
FIG 2 MGN1703 activates NK cells. PBMCs from ART-suppressed HIV-1-infected donors were incubated for 48 h with MGN1703 at the indicated concen-
trations. Controls included noCG-MGN1703 as a TLR9-specific negative control or cRPMI as an untreated control. Cells were stained and then assessed by flow
cytometry. (A to C) The median percentage of CD69-positive CD56dim (CD56dim CD16�) NK cells increased up to 7.5-fold in response to MGN1703. Also,
CD56bright (CD56bright CD16�/�) and CD56neg (CD56neg CD16�) NK cells increased the proportion of CD69-positive cells by 2.2- and 5-fold, respectively (for
comparative results for CpG-ODN2006, see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material). (D and E) The proportions of activated CD8� and CD4� T cells were
significantly increased. (F and G) Marginally more CD8� T cells were CD25 positive, while the proportion of CD25-positive CD4� T cells did not increase. (H)

 Using PBMCs from HIV-infected donors, we performed ex vivo
assessments of this molecule’s capacity to enhance immune effec-
tor functions as well as HIV-1 transcription. We found that
MGN1703 induces potent antiviral NK cell responses capable of
inhibiting virus spread in a culture of autologous CD4� T cells. In
addition, CD4� T cells isolated from MGN1703-incubated
PBMCs showed enhanced HIV-1 transcription. These data
suggest that this molecule may serve a dual purpose in HIV-1
eradication therapy: enhanced immune function and potential
latency reversal.
FIG 3 MGN1703 upregulates NK cell receptors NKp46 and NKG2A. PBMCs from ART-suppressed HIV-1-infected donors were incubated for 48 h with
MGN1703 (3 �M). cRPMI was used as an untreated control. Cells were stained and then assessed by flow cytometry. (A) Representative flow diagram for one
donor (represented by open black diamonds) showing expression of NK cell receptors on CD56dim NK cells. Initial gating was done as described in the legend of

the activating receptor NKp46. (C and D) For NKR-P1A, there was no significant change (C), while 1.08-fold more CD56dim NK cells increased the expression
of the inhibitory receptor NKG2A (D). NKp46 and NKG2A were exclusively upregulated on CD56dim NK cells by MGN1703 but not on CD56bright and CD56neg
subsets (see Fig. S3 in the supplemental material). Each donor in Fig. 1 to 4 is represented by the same distinct symbol. Lines represent the median.

 Since stimulations were done on PBMCs, and not isolated cell
types, we expected to see natural variation among the donors, at
the levels of both basal expression (untreated) and responsiveness
to MGN1703. The reasons why donors respond differently can be
numerous. Potential explanations could be differences in PBMC
compositions (e.g., the percentage of plasmacytoid dendritic
cells), basal immune activation levels, cytokine profiles, TLR9 ex-
pression, and/or TLR9 signaling cascade differences.
To understand the impact of incubation with MGN1703 on
donor PBMCs, we assayed the culture supernatants and observed
that MGN1703 significantly increased the production of IFN-�
and CXCL-10, without substantial increases in TNF-� and with
no induction of IL-2 and IL-6. This has several advantages. First,
the TLR9 agonists activated the anticipated pathways of type I
interferon and interferon-stimulated genes. Second, there was no
massive or broad release of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6
and TNF-�. These observations are particularly important in light
of the large body of evidence of pathological conditions associated
with elevated inflammation in HIV-1-infected individuals (36).
Because activation via IL-2 signaling through CD25 (the IL-2 re-
ceptor � chain) is a powerful mediator of T cell homeostatic pro-
liferation (37), and homeostatic proliferation of CD4� T cells
could potentially lead to an expansion of the HIV-1 reservoir (38),
we examined CD25 expression on T cells and IL-2 levels in the
FIG 4 Panobinostat does not alter MGN1703 activity. PBMCs from ART-suppressed HIV-1-infected donors were stimulated for 16 h with either MGN1703 (3
�M), CPG-ODN2006 (0.75 �M) (see Fig. S5 in the supplemental material), panobinostat (7.5 nM), or cRPMI as an untreated control. Cells were stained and
then assessed by flow cytometry. Cytokine levels were measured in culture supernatants. (A to D) Overall, there was no significant difference between a TLR9
agonist alone and coadministration with panobinostat. Specifically, panobinostat did not inhibit the MGN1703-induced production of IFN-� (A) or CXCL-10
(B). Furthermore, panobinostat did not inhibit the percentage of NK cells expressing NKG2A (C) or CD69 (D). NS, not significant. (E and F) Representative flow

 culture supernatants. We did not observe increases in the num-
bers of CD4� T cells expressing CD25, nor did we observe an
increase in IL-2 secretion from PBMCs following incubation with
MGN1703. Together, these observations indicate that MGN1703
can activate immune cells from HIV-1-infected individuals with-
out inducing a broad cytokine response or indicators of increased
proliferation.
A key observation from our study is that incubation with
MGN1703 led to the activation of NK cells. Of note, the propor-
tion of CD69-expressing CD56dim NK cells, which is the major
subset responsible for degranulation (29), increased 7.5-fold with
MGN1703-mediated activation. This finding is particularly rele-
vant in light of our recent clinical trial assessing panobinostat as a
latency-reversing agent (LRA) in 15 HIV-infected individuals
(19). A substudy analysis revealed that the proportion of CD69-
expressing CD56dim CD16� NK cells was inversely associated with
HIV-1 DNA levels throughout the study (39). This observation
could be interpreted to mean that activated CD56dim CD16� NK
cells, which are efficiently activated by MGN1703, are particularly
important for efficient killing of HIV-1-infected cells.
To prevent killing of uninfected autologous cells, triggering of
NK cell effector functions is tightly regulated by several surface-
expressed receptors, balancing between activating and inhibitory
signals (40). We examined the expressions of three different
receptors, NKp46, NKG2A, and NKR-P1A, to assess whether
MGN1703-mediated activation would increase the preexisting
FIG 5 MGN1703 enhances HIV-1 transcription ex vivo. (A and B) ACH2 and U1 cells were stimulated with MGN1703 in 2-fold serial dilutions from 6 nM to
6 �M. HIV-1 p24 antigen (ELISA) was used as a measure of latency reversal. Direct MGN1703 exposure did not increase HIV-1 production in these latently
infected cell models. (C) PBMCs from HIV-1-negative donors were stimulated for 48 h with MGN1703. Culture supernatants were then transferred to U1 cells
and incubated for 36 h before the level of HIV-1 p24 antigen in the supernatant was quantified. In response to supernatants from MGN1703-stimulated PBMCs,
U1 cells were shown to significantly increase median HIV-1 production up to 2.2-fold. (D) PBMCs from ART-suppressed HIV-1-infected donors were incubated
for 16 h with MGN1703 (3 �M) or cRPMI as an untreated control, CD4� T cells were then isolated by negative selection, and RNA was extracted. HIV-1 usRNA
levels were measured by using seminested RT-qPCR. MGN1703 significantly enhanced the transcription of HIV-1 usRNA ex vivo by a median of 1.4-fold. Lines

 balance of activating over inhibitory receptors, which potentially
could lead to increased degranulation and killing. We in fact ob-
served an increased percentage of NK cells expressing the activat-
ing NK cytotoxicity receptor NKp46. Interestingly, NKp46 is im-
portant for NK cell-mediated lysis of HIV-1-infected CD4� T cells
(30). Also, reduced surface expression of NKp46 has been associ-
ated with poor cytolytic function during HIV-1 disease (41). The
expression level of the inhibitory NK cell receptor NKG2A also
increased although not to the same extent as that for NKp46.
These findings indicate that the ability of MGN1703 to induce the
expression of NKp46 might enhance NK cell-mediated killing of
HIV-1-infected cells.
We next evaluated the potential interaction between a potent
HDACi, panobinostat, and MGN1703 on the findings described
above. We examined 13 immune functions and/or activation pa-
rameters (e.g., IFN-� production, CXCL-10 production, and
CD69 expression on NK and T cells) and did not observe any
statistically significant differences between the outcomes of
MGN1703 alone and MGN1703 plus panobinostat for either
IFN-� or CXCL-10 production or the activation of NK cells or T
cells and expression of NK cell receptors (Fig. 4). These data sug-
gest that MGN1703-induced immune activation during a shock-
and-kill eradication trial would persist during concurrent HDACi
dosing.
Recent data suggest that TLR agonists may function as LRAs.
Whitney et al. recently reported that a TLR7 agonist given to sim-
ian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected ART-suppressed rhe-
sus macaques caused transient but consistent increases in levels of
plasma virus (500 to 1,000 SIV RNA copies/ml) (42). Also, Novis
et al. reported that agonists of TLR1/TLR2 (but not TLR3 or
TLR9) induced HIV-1 transcription in their latently infected pri-
mary T cell model but not in HIV-1 patient CD4� T cells stimu-
lated ex vivo (43). We considered that the lack of TLR9 expression
on T cells could account for their observation that TLR9 did not
activate transcription. Therefore, our evaluation of the LRA capa-
bilities of MGN1703 and CpG-ODN2006 was performed using
total PBMCs, not isolated CD4� T cells, allowing the evaluation of
an indirect LRA mechanism. When we incubated freshly isolated
PBMCs and measured the levels of HIV-1 usRNA transcription in
subsequently isolated CD4� T cells, we found that MGN1703
caused relatively small, but significant, increases in HIV-1 usRNA
transcription (Fig. 5D). Furthermore, we found that incubation
of U1 cells directly with MGN1703 did not yield a change in
virus transcription; however, transfer of the supernatant from
MGN1703-incubated PBMCs to U1 cells increased the levels of
viral transcription significantly (Fig. 5C). Together, our data sup-
port the concept that MGN1703 potentially can function as a LRA
via an indirect mechanism.
During NK cell-mediated killing of target cells, like, e.g., reac-
tivated latently HIV-1-infected CD4� T cells, it is crucial that NK
cells deliver cytotoxic payloads via degranulation. We therefore
examined the ability of MGN1703 to increase the degranulatory
potential of NK cells, using the degranulation marker CD107a.
We indeed found that a larger amount of NK cells expressed
CD107a when cocultured with MHC-I-deficient K562 cells. Fur-
thermore, the intracellular production of IFN-� was also sig-
FIG 7 MGN1703 enhances NK cell-mediated inhibition of HIV-1-producing autologous CD4� T cells. PBMCs from ART-suppressed HIV-1-infected donors
were stimulated for 48 h with MGN1703 (3 �M) or cRPMI as an untreated control. NK cells were subsequently purified by negative magnetic selection and
cocultured with autologous HIV-1-infected CD4� T cells as target cells at a ratio of 1:1. HIV-1-infected CD4� T cells cocultured without NK cells served as a
relative parameter for maximal HIV-1 p24 antigen release, measured on days 1, 3, and 5 by an ELISA. (A and B) Cross-sectional analysis on day 5 revealed
significantly less p24 antigen in the culture supernatant for MGN1703-treated NK cells than in untreated NK cells (n � 5; lines represent the median) (A) and a
trend toward reduced numbers of p24� CD4� T cells in wells with MGN1703-treated NK cells (P � 0.18) (B). To determine this, cells from day 5 (n � 4) were
collected, stained for intracellular HIV-1 p24 antigen, and analyzed by flow cytometry (B). CD4� T cells were gated as live, single, CD3� CD8neg T cells. Data from
all donors were normalized to data for CD4� T cells cultured without NK cells. (C) By analyzing these data longitudinally, instead of cross-sectionally at day 5,
the AUCs encompass p24 antigen release from day 1 through day 5, showing significantly reduced levels of p24 antigen in the supernatants. This confirms the
impact of MGN1703 on the ability of NK cells to inhibit viral spread over time. Depicted are the mean values (� standard errors of the means) (n � 5) at each
time point, with connecting lines generating a curve for each condition. For each individual, an AUC was calculated for each condition and used to make AUC
comparisons. Each donor in panels A and B is represented by the same distinct symbol.

 nificantly increased (Fig. 6B and C). Although ACH2 cells do
not trigger NK cell degranulation as potently as K562 cells,
MGN1703-activated NK cells were also significantly better at
degranulation in response to latently HIV-1-infected ACH2
cells than untreated NK cells (Fig. 6E). This indicates that
MGN1703 increases the ability of NK cells to degranulate in
response to different triggering mechanisms, as would also be
the case in vivo.
After establishing that MGN1703-mediated activation en-
hanced NK cell activation, degranulation, and IFN-� production,
we tested the function of these NK cells in an HIV-1 spreading
assay (Fig. 7). Given the variation of quantitative viral outgrowth
assays and the fact that they may require two or even more stim-
ulations to initiate virus production (44–46), we determined that
a viral inhibition culture with active replication would be a greater
challenge for the NK cells to overcome while providing a more
reliable assessment of the MGN1703-induced NK cell-mediated
effect on viral challenge. We indeed found that MGN1703-acti-
vated NK cells could limit the spread of HIV-1 in autologous
CD4� T cells. We also tested MGN1703-activated CD8 T cells
in the assay on two donors, finding no difference between
MGN1703-treated and untreated groups. Given that MGN1703-
activated NK cells became highly activated, we considered the pos-
sibility that the observed inhibition of virus spread in culture
could be due to autoreactivity toward the autologous CD4� T
cells. This was not the case, however, as our data showed that
CD4� T cells positive for intracellular HIV-1 p24 were preferen-
tially absent from the cultures that included MGN1703-activated
NK cells, a finding that could be explained by either lysis of HIV-
infected cells, inhibition of virus production (e.g., by �-chemo-
kines), or both.
In conclusion, we found that ex vivo incubation of PBMCs
from HIV-infected donors with MGN1703 led to (i) the release of
large amounts of IFN-� and CXCL-10, (ii) increased activation of
NK cells and T cells, (iii) increased NK cell degranulatory capacity
and intracellular IFN-� production, and (iv) efficient inhibition
of autologous HIV-1-producing CD4� T cells. These findings,
combined with the observations that MGN1703 stimulation in
addition enhanced HIV-1 usRNA transcription, provide a strong
preclinical basis for the inclusion of MGN1703 in future HIV-1
eradication trials.
