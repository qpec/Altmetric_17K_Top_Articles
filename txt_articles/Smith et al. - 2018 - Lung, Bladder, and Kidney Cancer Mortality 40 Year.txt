Abstract
Background: Region II in northern Chile (population 442 570) experienced a sudden major increase in arsenic water
concentrations in 1958 in the main city of Antofagasta, followed by a major reduction in exposure when an arsenic removal
plant was installed in 1970. It provides a unique opportunity to study latency effects of exposure to arsenic, and this is the
first study with mortality data up to 40 years after exposure reduction.
Methods: We previously identified high mortality rates in Region II up to the year 2000. Here we present rate ratios (RRs) for
Region II compared with all the rest of Chile from 2001 to 2010, and with unexposed Region V (population 1 539 852) for all
years from 1950 to 2010. All statistical tests were one-sided.
Results: From 2001 to 2010, comparing Region II with the rest of Chile, lung and bladder mortality were still greatly elevated
(RR ¼ 3.38, 95% confidence interval [CI] ¼ 3.19 to 3.58, P < .001 for lung cancer in men; RR ¼ 2.41, 95% CI ¼ 2.20 to 2.64, P < .001
for lung cancer in women; RR ¼ 4.79, 95% CI ¼ 4.20 to 5.46, P < .001 for bladder cancer in men; RR ¼ 6.43, 95% CI ¼ 5.49 to 7.54, P
< .001 for bladder cancer in women). Kidney cancer mortality was also elevated (RR ¼ 1.75, 95% CI ¼ 1.49 to 2.05, P < .001 for
men; RR ¼ 2.09, 95% CI ¼ 1.69 to 2.57, P < .001 for women). Earlier short latency acute myocardial infarction mortality
increases had subsided.
Conclusions: Lung, bladder, and kidney cancer mortality due to arsenic exposure have very long latencies, with increased
risks manifesting 40 years after exposure reduction. Our findings suggest that arsenic in drinking water may involve one of
the longest cancer latencies for a human carcinogen.
Inorganic arsenic is naturally present at high levels in the
groundwater of many countries, creating an important public
health issue affecting millions of people (1,2). Severe health
effects have been observed in populations drinking arsenic-
contaminated water over long periods, and research has estab-
lished that drinking water contaminated with arsenic causes
skin cancer and several internal cancers such as lung, bladder,
and kidney cancer, as well as cardiovascular disease and other
adverse outcomes (3–7). Major efforts have been made to reduce
arsenic exposure, but with long latency patterns, increased risks
will continue for many years.
Although little is known about the latency period between
exposure to arsenic and the risk of many arsenic-associated
noncancer diseases, a few earlier studies in Taiwan and Japan
and our own studies in Chile are consistent in suggesting that
internal cancers associated with arsenic ingestion have sub-
stantial latency periods, frequently in excess of 20 years from
the beginning of exposure (8–13). The knowledge of latency
effects is an important factor in assessing the public health
implications of arsenic exposure.
Our mortality study in Region II from 1950 to 2000 found
marked increased mortality from many cancers and other

 diseases (8,14–18). It also yielded important findings of latency
patterns between onset and decline of arsenic exposure and in-
creased lung, bladder, and kidney cancer mortality, and it was
the first study to map out latency for noncancer outcomes such
as acute myocardial infarction (AMI). We discovered that lung,
bladder, and kidney cancer mortality rates started to increase
about 10 years after the high exposures commenced and did not
peak until at least 20 years after exposure reduction began. AMI
mortality rates increased during and immediately after the
high-exposure period, and decreased 10 years after exposure re-
duction, but lung, bladder, and kidney cancer mortality for both
men and women remained elevated up to the year 2000, which
was 30 years after the highest exposures stopped (8,16,17). We
later conducted a population-based case–control study in north-
ern Chile from October 2007 to December 2010, involving 232
bladder, 306 lung, and 122 kidney cancer case patients, along
with 640 matched control subjects, with data on individual life-
time arsenic exposure and potential confounding factors. This
study identified clear dose-response relationships between ar-
senic exposure and lung, bladder, and kidney cancer (15,19).
The purpose of the present analysis is to extend our 1950–
2000 mortality investigation to cover 10 additional years, from
2001 to 2010, to see how mortality rates changed during 2001 to
2010, up to 40 years after the highest exposures stopped in 1970,
and thus assess their latency up to 52 years from when the
highest exposures started in 1958. We also wanted to check the
validity of our 2007–2010 cancer case–control study findings,
which were based on relatively small numbers of incident cases
compared with the much larger numbers of cancer deaths in
Region II from 2000 to 2010.
Methods
Exposure Data
The north of Chile (Figure 1) is the driest inhabited place on earth,
with only one water source for each city (9). Bottled water was
rarely used until recently; in a case–control study we are cur-
rently conducting among 296 participants who were residing in
Region II before 1970, only one reported using bottled water while
a resident there. Details concerning the historical arsenic concen-
trations in water in Region II have been reported previously
(4,16,20–22) and are summarized in Table 1 and Figure 2. Before
1958, the population-weighted average water arsenic concentra-
tion in Region II was 116.8 mg/L, but in 1958 when the major city
of Region II, Antofagasta, changed its water source, the average
for the Region increased more than fivefold to 600 mg/L (Table 1).
After the arsenic removal plant was installed in 1970, the
population-weighted average fell threefold to 193.3 mg/L, and by
1978 the average for the Region was 108.9 mg/L, which was lower
than the arsenic concentrations before 1958. Water arsenic con-
centrations have since been reduced further in subsequent years.
Arsenic concentrations across Region II are now mostly below
the current World Health Organization (WHO) guideline level of
10 mg/L (23). In summary, in Region II, there was a major increase
in water arsenic concentrations in 1958, a sudden threefold re-
duction in 1970, and by 1978 the average concentrations were
lower than they were before the high exposures began.
Mortality Data
Mortality data collection for the period from 1950 to 2000 was
detailed elsewhere (8,16). In short, computerized mortality data
for 1971 to 2000 for all of Chile were obtained from the Chilean
National Institute of Statistics and from the Ministry of Health.
Because mortality data are not available electronically for the
years 1950 to 1970 and it would have been impractical and pro-
hibitively expensive to collect mortality data ourselves for all
of Chile, we chose to compare Region II in these years with a
reference subpopulation within Chile. The key factors in
selecting this reference subpopulation were selecting 1) a pop-
ulation with very low to no arsenic exposure, 2) a population
that was sociodemographically similar to Region II, and 3) a
population that was large enough to maximize statistical pre-
cision but not so large that manually entering mortality infor-
mation would be unmanageable. Region V, with a population
of 1 539 852 in the 2002 Census, was selected as the most ap-
propriate reference population. Region V is located in the
northern half of Chile, with a population about 3.5 times that
of Region II (population 442 570), with no major sociodemo-
graphic differences from the rest of the country and no known
arsenic exposure. Detailed justification for selecting Region V
has been presented elsewhere (16). More than 200 000 death
certificates for Region II and Region V for the years 1950 to 1970
were photographed and coded by trained nosologists accord-
ing
to the
International Classification
of
Diseases
Ninth
Revision (ICD-9) who were blinded to the region of origin of
each death certificate.
Computerized mortality data for 2001 to 2010 were obtained
from the Ministry of Health for all of Chile, including 25 361
deaths for Region II and 102 544 deaths for Region V. The
International Classification of Diseases Tenth Revision (ICD-10)
codes had been used for these data. For our analysis, all the
ICD-10 codes were translated back to ICD-9 codes. The ICD code
189 for kidney cancer combines renal cell carcinoma and transi-
tional cell carcinoma.
The 1992, 2002, and 2012 census data were obtained for all of
Chile from the National Institute of Statistics, for men and
women separately, in 10-year age groups. Annual estimates of
the population living in Region II, Region V, and the rest of
Chile, stratified by age and sex for 2001 to 2010, were then esti-
mated by linear interpolation for years between each census.

 Statistical Analysis
We estimated Poisson regression rate ratios (RRs) for Region II
compared with all of the rest of Chile in 2001 to 2010, for lung
(ICD-9 code 162), bladder (ICD-9 code 188), and kidney cancer
(ICD-9 code 189), and acute myocardial infarction (ICD-9 code
410). Because these diseases were rare in persons younger than
age 30 years, the analyses were restricted to those age 30 years
and older. Ten-year age groups starting with age 30 to 39 years
and continuing to age 80 years and older were used for age
adjustment because the census data were available in this
form. Poisson regression analysis was performed using the
PROC GENMOD procedure provided in SAS software (version 9.4;
SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC). Analyses were conducted with the
link function as the log and the offset as the log of the total pop-
ulation in each region, sex, and age stratum.
To further assess latency patterns in mortality for Region II
compared with Region V for each year from 1950 to 2010, we cal-
culated and plotted the rate ratio (95% confidence interval [CI])
for each year combined with the two years before and two years
after it, thus smoothing short-term fluctuations. One-sided P
values from the Wald chi-square test were used in statistical
testing of the mortality of Region II compared with the rest of
Chile because the hypothesis was clearly unidirectional given
the earlier findings of marked increase in mortality from these
causes up to the year 2000.
Results
Table 2 presents lung, bladder, and kidney cancer and AMI mor-
tality rates per 100 000 persons and rate ratios comparing Region
II with the rest of Chile for 2001 to 2010, stratified by age and sex.
Lung and bladder mortality were still greatly elevated across al-
most all age groups (age-adjusted RR¼ 3.38, 95% CI ¼ 3.19 to 3.58,
P < .001 for lung cancer in men; RR ¼ 2.41, 95% CI ¼ 2.20 to 2.64, P
< .001 for lung cancer in women; RR ¼ 4.79, 95% CI ¼ 4.20 to 5.46,
P < .001 for bladder cancer in men; RR ¼ 6.43, 95% CI ¼ 5.49 to
7.54, P < .001 for bladder cancer in women). Kidney cancer mor-
tality was also moderately elevated across almost all age groups
(age-adjusted RR ¼ 1.75, 95% CI ¼ 1.49 to 2.05, P < .001 for men;
RR¼ 2.09, 95% CI ¼ 1.69 to 2.57, P < .001 for women). Arsenic may
only cause transitional cell carcinoma (19), but we are not able to
separate transitional cell kidney cancer from renal cell carci-
noma using death certificate data. AMI mortality for men was
slightly elevated compared with the rest of Chile (age-adjusted
RR¼ 1.14, 95% CI ¼ 1.07 to 1.21), while that for women was
slightly reduced (RR¼ 0.91, 95% CI ¼ 0.83 to 0.99).

 Table 2 also presents mortality findings in the period from
2001 to 2010 for all other cancer deaths, and also for all other
causes of death excluding AMI and cancer deaths. In contrast to
lung, bladder, and kidney cancer, there are only minor increases
in mortality from these combined causes, with age-adjusted
rate ratios being generally less than 1.1.
Figures 3 and 4 display the age-adjusted mortality rate ratios
from lung and bladder, comparing Region II with unexposed
Region V from 1950 to 2010. As explained previously, the com-
parison was with Region V because data for all of Chile were not
available for the period from 1950 to 1970. The very high expo-
sure in Region II commenced in 1958, and the arsenic removal
plant commenced operations in 1970. Lung and bladder cancer
mortality rate ratios started to increase about 10 years after the
high exposures commenced and did not peak until at least
20 years after the start of reductions in exposure, which was ap-
proximately 40 years after the high exposures commenced.
Kidney cancer mortality showed a similar trend (data not
shown), but with lower increased mortality and wider confi-
dence intervals due to smaller numbers; lung, bladder, and to a
lesser extent kidney cancer mortality, for both men and women,
remained elevated up to the year 2010 in Region II, 40 years after
the highest exposures were stopped. Even though they remain
elevated, it appears that the mortality rate ratio estimates have
started to decline for both lung and bladder cancer, after reach-
ing peaks in the 1980s and 1990s.
Discussion
The current study extends our previous investigations (8,16–18)
on latency patterns between onset and decline of arsenic expo-
sure and increased mortality from lung, bladder, and kidney
cancer and AMI. It provides clear evidence that lung, bladder,

remained elevated up to 40 years after very high arsenic expo-
sures ended, indicating very long latency patterns, while earlier
AMI mortality increases had subsided. This study also confirms,
with much larger numbers, the findings from our 2007–2010
population-based case–control study that there was increased
cancer incidence for lung, bladder, and kidney cancer 40 years
after high arsenic exposures ended (15).
Arsenic is rapidly excreted from the body either as inorganic
arsenic itself or the methylated metabolites MMA and DMA
(24–26). Within one week, more than half the ingested inor-
ganic arsenic will have been excreted in the urine (27,28),
which on the surface makes it surprising that cancer risks
should persist more than 40 years after exposure. Cigarette car-
cinogens are also rapidly excreted and cancer risks persist for
many years, with elevated lung cancer risks still detectable
30 years or more after smoking cessation, although in contrast
to our arsenic findings, relative risks after smoking cessation
compared with continuing smokers are already reduced by
10 years after quitting and are markedly reduced 30 years after
smoking cessation, with most studies reporting lung cancer rel-
ative risks of less than 2 (29–32). The longest latency so far
established for a human cancer is that between asbestos and
malignant mesothelioma, with risks continuing and even in-
creasing more than 40 years after exposure ceases (33,34).
Asbestos fibers can be highly persistent in the body, but as the
persistence is in lung tissue, where mesotheliomas do not arise
(35,36), this persistence is probably not relevant to mesotheli-
oma latency. We plan to continue studying this arsenic-
exposed population, but we can already conclude that the la-
tency from exposure to arsenic-caused cancer could be one of
the longest latencies for any human cancer.
The elevated mortality rates among those age 40 to 59 years
in the current study are consistent with early life exposure

 effects. Those who died in this age range between 2000 and
2010 would have been born before 1970 when high exposures
ceased, and at the extreme would have been born in 1940, and
therefore age 18 or younger when exposures commenced. Based
on 1989–2000 data, we previously reported increased mortality
in young adults age 30 to 49 years following early life exposure
to arsenic for lung cancer, bladder cancer, kidney cancer, and
AMI (8,9,16,17). However, with no data on birth location, we can-
not confirm early life exposure. We are currently working on a
computer linkage study in which we connect individual death
certificate date with the corresponding birth certificate data,
aiming to reach a definitive conclusion where we can separate
those born in the high-exposure region from those born
elsewhere.
Our study is not without limitations. It is ecological, which
usually carries some disadvantages, including lack of individual
exposure data and individual information on confounding fac-
tors. However, our study has several advantageous features for
evaluating causality, with several factors that minimize the
impacts of confounding and the ecologic fallacy. The arsenic ex-
posure scenario in Region II is highly unusual. As the driest
inhabited place on earth, everyone had to drink from city sour-
ces with known arsenic concentrations. Therefore, living in
Region II from 1958 to 1970 establishes exposure to arsenic in
drinking water. Including those who did not live there but mi-
grated to Region II in recent years would result in an underesti-
mation of the mortality risk from arsenic in drinking water. As
we have detailed elsewhere (4), we know of no other environ-
mental exposure situation in the world in which many more
than 100 000 people have been uniformly exposed during such a
distinct and well-documented period to high levels of a drinking
water contaminant.

 An advantage of our study design is the large number of sub-
jects that can be included in the analysis. Other types of studies,
such as case–control or cohort studies, have fewer subjects and
often limited longitudinal exposure data. In most studies where
exposure is from private wells, it is usually impossible to work
out what individual exposures were many years ago (16,37–40).
The highly unusual exposure scenario that occurred in Region II
allows assessment of the long-term impacts of arsenic exposure
on more than 100 000 people because arsenic measurements
are available for water supply from the 1950s onward, so reliable
arsenic exposure data are available for more than 60 years.
Region II, with the existence of accurate records on past expo-
sure, the availability of historic mortality records, and the pres-
ence of demographically similar reference areas, has provided
us with an excellent opportunity to investigate the long-term
effects of arsenic exposure on mortality from cancer and other
diseases.
Another advantage of the ecologic study is that it enables us
to assess many different causes of death at once. Further
individual-level studies can be conducted based on the results
from
the
ecologic
studies.
In
addition
to
our
published
population-based northern Chile case–control study (15), we
have also begun other studies for lung and cardiovascular dis-
eases. The design and prioritization of these studies are highly
dependent on our prior ecologic mortality results.
As mentioned previously, individual data on confounding
factors were not available for our study, but there are three rea-
sons that our findings could not be due to confounding. The first
reason is timing. We have previously noted that for confound-
ing factors to explain the rise and fall in AMI mortality, they
would have to have a similar trend in time to the rise and fall of
arsenic concentrations (16). For example, if smoking were to ex-
plain the changing mortality rate ratios between Regions II and
V, there would have to be a sudden increase in smoking rates in
Region II compared with Region V in the 1950s, followed by a re-
turn to similar smoking rates in the 1970s. Smoking is a major
risk factor for lung cancer. But the persisting high lung cancer
rate ratios in the period from 2000 to 2010, when AMI rates had
fallen back down close to those in the rest of Chile before 2000
(18), is evidence that smoking was not the cause of the continu-
ing high lung cancer mortality.
The second reason for rejecting confounding is the magni-
tude of mortality rate ratios identified. The rate ratio estimate
for bladder cancer mortality among men in Region II was 4.74
(95% CI ¼ 3.19 to 6.8) during the period from 2000 to 2010
compared with the rest of Chile, and it was even higher in ear-
lier years. The relative risk for smokers dying from bladder can-
cer compared with nonsmokers is usually in the range of 2 to 4
(41), and in our case–control study in northern Chile, it was 2.7
for those who smoked more than 10 cigarettes per day (9). So
even if everyone in Region II smoked cigarettes from 1958 to
2000 and nobody in the rest of Chile smoked, you would not ex-
pect the bladder cancer mortality relative risks in Region II to be
as high as we found. The bladder cancer mortality rate ratios we
report for women were even higher than for men. The lung can-
cer mortality rate ratios for both men and women are also far
greater than could result from confounding (42). We have previ-
ously reported detailed reasoning for rejecting smoking as the
explanation of our cancer findings in the north of Chile (16).
The third reason for rejecting confounding is that we have
evidence, both from smoking survey data and from our case–
control studies with individual smoking data, that smoking was
not a confounding factor for lung and bladder cancer findings in
Region II of Chile. Although case–control studies with individual
data on smoking found that arsenic increased the risk of lung
and bladder cancer, smoking did not confound the relationship
(9,21,22). In addition, survey data from 1990 up to 2014 showed
that the smoking rates were similar in Region II, Region V, and
all of Chile (Table 3) (17,43–45). No major differences were found
between Region II and all of Chile in demographic characteris-
tics and other factors (17).
In conclusion, this study provides evidence of increases in
lung, bladder, and kidney cancer even 40 years after high arse-
nic exposures ended. These findings not only add important sci-
entific information on latency patterns that may be as long or

 longer than for any other cause of cancer, they also have direct
public health implications. The long latency after exposure re-
duction means the incidence of arsenic-related diseases is likely
to remain very high for many years after arsenic exposures
have stopped, highlighting the importance of eliminating expo-
sures as soon as possible and the importance of public health
efforts to reduce mortality and morbidity long after high expo-
sures are stopped. Possible long-term interventions include dis-
ease screening, reducing important co-exposures, treatment
and health services resource planning, and increasing public
awareness of arsenic health effects.
