S
troke is a major cause of death and disability worldwide.1,2 
Although traditionally perceived as a disease of older 
age, stroke in younger individuals is increasingly emerging 
as a public health issue,3,4 the average age at stroke onset is 
decreasing, and stroke incidence and hospitalization rates are 
rising among young in some countries.5–8 A better understand-
ing of contributions of modifiable risk factors to the burden 
of stroke in young adults is important for effective preventive 
strategies. Only recent studies have provided evidence that 
established stroke risk factors are more common in the young 
than previously assumed.3,9–13
The contribution of cardiovascular risk factors to the overall 
stroke risk was assessed previously.13–16 Depending on the num-
ber of included risk factors, ≈90% of strokes can be explained by 
high blood pressure, smoking, obesity, diet, physical inactivity, 
diabetes mellitus, alcohol consumption, mental distress, heart 
disease, and lipid disorders.13–16 However, these studies were 
mostly conducted in older populations, whereas stroke in the 
young is generally assumed to differ in risk factors and patho-
genesis.3,17,18 The INTERSTROKE study recently provided evi-
dence for the importance of established stroke risk factors for 
stroke in the young in a subgroup analysis.13 However, the study 
sample was very heterogenous due to different sampling meth-
ods across countries and differences between stroke subtypes, 
sex, age groups, or regions remained unrevealed.
We aimed to examine the contribution of 8 established 
stroke risk factors to the risk of stroke in young and middle-
aged adults (≤55 years) in Germany. Furthermore, we explore 
differences in the contribution to ischemic and hemorrhagic 
stroke, ischemic stroke subtypes, sex, and age strata.
Background and Purpose—As stroke in young adults is assumed to have different etiologies and risk factors than in older 
populations, the aim of this study was to examine the contribution of established potentially modifiable cardiovascular 
risk factors to the burden of stroke in young adults.
Methods—A German nationwide case–control study based on patients enrolled in the SIFAP1 study (Stroke In Young Fabry 
Patients) 2007 to 2010 and controls from the population-based GEDA study (German Health Update) 2009 to 2010 was 
performed. Cases were 2125 consecutive patients aged 18 to 55 years with acute first-ever stroke from 26 clinical stroke 
centers; controls (age- and sex-matched, n=8500, without previous stroke) were from a nationwide community sample. 
Adjusted population-attributable risks of 8 risk factors (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, coronary heart 
disease, smoking, heavy episodic alcohol consumption, low physical activity, and obesity) and their combinations for all 
stroke, ischemic stroke, and primary intracerebral hemorrhage were calculated.
Results—Low physical activity and hypertension were the most important risk factors, accounting for 59.7% (95% 
confidence interval, 56.3–63.2) and 27.1% (95% confidence interval, 23.6–30.6) of all strokes, respectively. All 8 risk 
factors combined explained 78.9% (95% confidence interval, 76.3–81.4) of all strokes. Population-attributable risks of all 
risk factors were similar for all ischemic stroke subtypes. Population-attributable risks of most risk factors were higher 
in older age groups and in men.
Conclusions—Modifiable risk factors previously established in older populations also account for a large part of stroke in 
younger adults, with 4 risk factors explaining almost 80% of stroke risk.

Methods
Study Sample
We performed a nationwide case–control study of patients with first-
ever stroke aged 18 to 55 years in Germany who were matched by age 
and sex to population controls without history of stroke.
Cases were patients with first-ever stroke across Germany enrolled 
in the SIFAP1 study (Stroke In Young Fabry Patients), a multicenter 
observational study from 2007 to 2010 which included 5023 patients 
with stroke or transient ischemic attack aged 18 to 55 years in 47 
centers in 15 European countries (26 in Germany). Details of the 
study have previously been published.19 Sociodemographic, clinical, 
neuroimaging, and laboratory data were collected by clinical assess-
ment, by personal or proxy interview, and from medical records. 
Median time between stroke onset and study enrollment was 4 days 
(interquartile range, 2–8 days). Stroke was diagnosed based on clini-
cal diagnosis of study neurologists and results of magnetic resonance 
imaging scans and classified as ischemic stroke, primary intracere-
bral hemorrhage (PICH), or other cerebrovascular disease.9,19 Patients 
receiving thrombolysis and those with clinical transient ischemic 
attack (symptoms <24 hours) but evidence of an acute ischemic 
lesion on magnetic resonance imaging were also classified as hav-
ing ischemic strokes. Ischemic stroke cases were categorized into 
etiologic subtypes according to the TOAST (Trial of ORG 10172 in 
Acute Stroke Treatment) classification.20
After excluding 1715 patients from other countries and 604 
German patients with transient ischemic attack, 2704 patients from 
26 German centers were eligible for this study. Of these, we excluded 
409 patients with a history of stroke prior to the index event, 46 with 
other cerebrovascular disease (eg, cerebral venous thrombosis, sub-
arachnoid hemorrhage, cerebral vasculitis), and 124 with missing 
information on pathological stroke subtype, leaving 2125 cases of 
first-ever stroke for analyses.
Controls were drawn from waves 2009 and 2010 of the nationwide 
population-based study GEDA (German Health Update).21 GEDA is a 
cross-sectional health interview survey in independent nationally rep-
resentative samples of the general population aged ≥18 years living in 
private households in Germany.21 Study participants were selected by 
random sampling of all landline telephone numbers. Comprehensive 
data on physician-diagnosed diseases, health-related behaviors, 
sociodemographics, and other characteristics were collected using 
standardized computer-assisted telephone interviews.21
Of all 43 312 GEDA participants, we excluded 13 373 who were 
>56 years, 181 with a history of physician-diagnosed stroke, and 
26 with missing information on previous stroke. From the resulting 
29 732 eligible GEDA participants, 8500 controls were matched to 
cases in a 4:1 ratio for sex and age ±1 year.
All patients participating in the SIFAP1 study or their legal repre-
sentatives gave written informed consent. The study was approved 
by local ethical committees of all participating centers. Each GEDA 
wave was approved by the Federal Commissioner for Data Protection 
and Freedom of Information, and verbal informed consent was 
obtained from all participants.21
Assessment of Risk Factors
Comparable information for cases and controls was available on 8 
established stroke risk factors: hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabe-
tes mellitus, coronary heart disease, smoking, heavy episodic alcohol 
consumption, low physical activity, and obesity.
Data on lifetime history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes 
mellitus, and coronary heart disease (defined as myocardial infarction 
or other clinical manifestation, eg, angina pectoris) were collected 
by study physicians from medical records and patient self-reports 
using standardized case report forms in SIFAP9,19 and based on self-
reported physician diagnosis using standardized computer-assisted 
telephone interviews in GEDA.21,22
Smoking behavior was classified as never, former, and current 
smoking in SIFAP10 and GEDA.23 Heavy episodic alcohol con-
sumption was defined as >5 alcoholic drinks per day at least once 
a month in SIFAP.10 In GEDA, alcohol consumption was assessed 
using the 3-question Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test,24,25 
and heavy episodic alcohol consumption was defined as >5 drinks 
per occasion at least once a month. Physical activity was assessed 
by questions on frequency and duration of physical activity per day 
and week in SIFAP10 and GEDA23 and classified as low, moderate, 
or high (Table 1). Body mass index (BMI) was calculated based on 
measured body height and weight in SIFAP10 and self-reported height 
and weight in GEDA23 and categorized into <25 kg/m2, 25–<30 kg/m2 
(overweight), and ≥30 kg/m2 (obesity).
Statistical Analysis
We calculated population-attributable risks (PAR) of individual risk 
factors for stroke and their combinations using the method introduced 
by Bruzzi et al, which is based on logistic regression models and 
allows adjustment for confounding.26
To account for the matching, we used conditional logistic regres-
sion. Regression models were adjusted for all other risk factors to 
control confounding. For binary risk factors, the reference was the 
category that describes absence of the risk factor. For categorical risk 
factors, the reference was the category with the lowest risk of stroke. 
In additional analyses, PARs were calculated for a 1-step improve-
ment in the categorical risk factors of smoking (current to former 
smokers), physical activity (low to moderate or moderate to high 
physical activity), and BMI (obesity to overweight or overweight to 
<25 kg/m2).
Combined PAR estimates are derived for different sets of variables, 
sequentially combining risk factors with the highest individual PAR 
for all stroke and grouped into behavioral and medical risk factors. 
We additionally estimated PAR for all stroke stratified by sex and age 
groups (18–34, 35–44, and 45–55 years) and PAR for ischemic stroke 
stratified by TOAST etiologic subtypes.
We estimated 95% confidence intervals using a jackknife (leav-
ing 10 out) estimation of the variance,27 in contrast to the parametric 
variance estimation for PAR introduced by Benichou and Gail28 that 
was applied in the INTERSTROKE study14 and in the INTERHEART 
study29 via its implementation in the Interactive Risk Attributable 
Program software (US National Cancer Institute, 2002). For all anal-
yses, the statistical software R was used.30 The PAR point estimator 
based on conditional logistic regression and the variance estimator 
based on jackknife are implemented in the R package attribrisk.27
To take into account all information of the data set, we used mul-
tiple imputation based on 10 imputed data sets generated by the R 
package mice.31 Subsequently, the PAR point estimate and variance 
estimates were pooled according to Rubin.32

controls, and 38% were female. The prevalence of all risk fac-
tors was higher in cases than in controls. Difference in preva-
lence between cases and controls was highest for low physical 
activity (30%), hypertension (22%), heavy episodic alcohol 
consumption (15%), and current smoking (12%). Compared 
with ischemic stroke cases, PICH cases had a higher preva-
lence of hypertension and a lower prevalence of hyperlipid-
emia, diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, and current 
smoking.
PAR for All Stroke, Ischemic Stroke, and PICH
Low physical activity and hypertension were the 2 most 
important individual risk factors for all stroke, with adjusted 
PARs of 59.7% and 27.1%, respectively (Table 3). In com-
bination with heavy episodic alcohol consumption and 
smoking, the combined PAR for these 4 risk factors was 
77.6%. Diabetes mellitus explained 4.4% of all stroke, 
while hyperlipidemia, coronary heart disease, and over-
weight/obesity did not contribute to the risk of all stroke. 
All 8 examined risk factors together explained 78.9% of all 
strokes (Table 3).
In additional analyses using 1-step-improvement scenarios 
for categorical risk factors, the PAR of smoking for all stroke 
increased to 14.0% (95% confidence interval, 8.1–19.9); the 
PAR of physical activity decreased to 44.0% (95% confidence 
interval, 41.0–47.0), and the PAR of BMI decreased to 5.1% 
(95% confidence interval, 0.5–9.8).
For ischemic stroke, similar contributions of individual and 
combined risk factors were found (Table 3). The combined 
PAR of low physical activity, hypertension, heavy episodic 
alcohol consumption, and smoking was 77.5%, and the total 
PAR of all 8 risk factors was 79.1%. Unlike for all stroke, 
overweight/obesity contributed significantly to the risk of 
ischemic stroke and accounted for 6.9% of cases.
Compared with ischemic stroke, PICH were to a greater 
extent explained by hypertension (PAR, 55.8%) and heavy 
episodic alcohol consumption (PAR, 23.8%), while low phys-
ical activity accounted for a similar proportion of PICH (PAR, 
61.8%; Table 3). These 3 risk factors combined explained 
86.5% of PICH cases. In contrast to ischemic stroke, diabetes 
mellitus, smoking, and overweight/obesity did not contribute 
to PICH risk.
PAR by Sex, Age Groups, and 
Ischemic Stroke Subtypes
PARs of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking, and alcohol 
consumption for all stroke were higher in men than in women, 
while women had higher PAR of low physical activity and 
overweight/obesity (Figure 1). Confidence intervals, however, 
overlapped widely, except for diabetes mellitus and alcohol.
The contribution of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smok-
ing, alcohol consumption, and low physical activity to the risk 
of all stroke was higher in 45- to 55-year-old groups, compared 
with younger age groups (Figure 2). Combined PAR of all risk 
factors was still 56% in those <35 years, mostly because of the 
contribution of low physical activity (PAR, 50.6%).
PAR of all risk factors were similar for all ischemic 
stroke subtypes, with widely overlapping confidence intervals 
(Figure 3) and without evidence for distinct differences in 
PAR between subtypes.
Discussion
In this case–control study with young stroke patients (18–55 
years) and population-based controls in Germany, the 4 poten-
tially modifiable risk factors hypertension, low physical activ-
ity, smoking, and alcohol consumption explained ≈78% of all 
stroke, with low physical activity and hypertension being the 
2 most important risk factors, accounting for ≈70% of stroke. 
Contribution of risk factors differed between ischemic and 
hemorrhagic stroke. PARs of most risk factors were similar 
for all ischemic stroke subtypes. Men had significantly higher 
PAR for diabetes mellitus and alcohol consumption than 
women. Comparing age groups, the contribution of some risk

factors increased with increasing age. However, total PAR of 
all risk factors in those <35 years was still 56%, mostly driven 
by low physical activity. Our findings add to and extend pre-
vious study results by providing information on differences 
according to stroke subtypes, sex, and age groups.
Comparison to Other Studies
Some recent studies have reported adjusted PAR of estab-
lished cardiovascular risk factors and their combination 
for overall stroke in older populations.13–16 Of these, the 
INTERSTROKE study also reported results for younger 
stroke patients.13 We examined 8 of the 10 risk factors associ-
ated with stroke in the INTERSTROKE study, a case–control 
study in 32 countries worldwide, including 13 447 cases with 
first-ever stroke and 13 472 controls.13 In a subgroup analy-
sis including 4216 cases aged ≤55 years, all factors together 
explained 92% of strokes. Most risk factors were similarly 
important for older and younger individuals, but PAR for 
smoking, waist-to-hip ratio, alcohol, and psychosocial factors 
were somewhat higher for younger individuals. Similar to our 
study, hypertension, low physical activity, alcohol consump-
tion, and smoking were the most important risk factors for 
younger adults.
Our study, however, provides important additional infor-
mation on sociodemographic subgroups and highlights 
differences between ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke not 
assessed in INTERSTROKE. Most notably, the contribu-
tion of risk factors differed considerably between ischemic 
stroke and PICH in our study. With regard to sex differ-
ences, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, alcohol, and smok-
ing are more important risk factors in men than in women. 
The subdivision into 3 age groups shows that total PAR is 
as high as 56.4% even among those aged 18 to 34 years, 
although the contribution of most risk factors was higher in 
older age groups. The total PAR in this youngest age group 
<35 years was almost completely because of low physical 
activity. The individual contributions of hypertension, dia-
betes mellitus, and smoking (Figure 2), and consequently

also the total PAR, were higher among those aged 35 to 44 
(PAR=74.2%) and the 45 to 55 years (PAR=84.7%). The 
large total PAR of 79% for the overall sample may, there-
fore, partly be explained by the dominance of the highest 
age group (45–55 years), accounting for 61% of the cases. 
However, our study had a much higher proportion of individ-
uals aged ≤45 years (44%) than in INTERSTROKE (12%) 
among individuals aged ≤55 and was, therefore, even able to 
compare age groups within this age range. The total PAR in 
our study was lower than that in the INTERSTROKE study

for those aged ≤55 years,13 which could partly be because 
of the younger sample in our study and also because of the 
fact that some important risk factors were not examined, 
notably atrial fibrillation, psychosocial factors, diet, and 
waist-to-hip ratio.15,33 In line with other studies, including 
the INTERSTROKE study,13,34,35 obesity measured with BMI 
was not a risk factor in our study. Low physical activity was 
the most important contributor to the total PAR for all stroke 
and ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke in both sexes and all 
age groups. This finding is biologically plausible given that 
physical inactivity is itself a risk factor for most metabolic 
risk factors (such as diabetes mellitus, obesity, and hyperten-
sion) and is correlated with other unhealthy behaviors (such 
as unhealthy diet and alcohol consumption). However, our 
high PAR estimates for low physical activity may partly be 
explained by unmeasured confounding from stroke risk fac-
tors, which are also known to be correlated with physical 
inactivity, such as lower socioeconomic status and mental 
disorders (eg, depression), and which we could not adjust 
for in our analyses. The contribution of low physical activity 
to total PAR was slightly lower in INTERSTROKE, which 
adjusted analyses for psychosocial factors and diet.
Two other recent studies have examined PARs of individ-
ual risk factors for stroke in younger adults in Asia, but their 
findings are difficult to compare with our findings and those 
of the INTERSTROKE study.36,37 A study from Indonesia 
estimated individual PARs of 5 risk factors in people aged 
<55 and ≥55 years, but PAR estimates were not adjusted for 
other risk factors, and no combined PARs were estimated.36 
A case–control study from South Korea estimated adjusted 
PARs of 7 risk factors in different age groups.37 However, 
subjects with previous stroke were not excluded, age groups 
were not comparable to other studies, and combined PARs 
were again not estimated.
The interpretation of PARs has to take into account that 
diseases are often multicausal. Therefore, a combination 
of PARs is not simply the addition of individual PARs. 
The chosen method of combining PARs assumes no devia-
tion from multiplicative interaction between the risk fac-
tors, which might not always be the case. Nonetheless, this

method is also applied in other stroke studies, leaving the 
comparison between our results and other studies still fea-
sible. Furthermore, PARs are a function of both prevalence 
and relative risk of the factor of interest, rendering it pos-
sible that some relatively common risk factors have higher 
PARs compared with others despite lower relative risks. 
Therefore, the reported PARs depend on the choice of expo-
sure categories.
Strengths and Limitations
The main strength of this study is the large sample of young 
stroke patients assessed with standardized diagnostic tests 
and measures and the large nationwide sample of community 
controls, allowing a good representation of the general popu-
lation, comparative analyses for ischemic and hemorrhagic 
stroke and ischemic stroke subtypes, and stratified analyses by 
sex and age group. Moreover, we estimated adjusted PARs to 
derive the independent contribution of risk factors. Some of the 
included risk factors may be highly correlated with each other, 
but in sensitivity analyses, there was no indication of collin-
earity when comparing point and variance estimates for BMI, 
physical activity, and diabetes mellitus from models with and 
without mutual adjustment for the respective other variables 
(data not shown). In contrast to the heterogeneous sample 
from many diverse developed and developing countries of the 
INTERSTROKE study,13 we only analyzed PARs for stroke in 
Germany, used stricter matching criteria (age matching±1 year 
instead of ±5 years), and used a case–control ratio of 1:4 instead 
of 1:1 to optimize power and account for variation in controls.
The main limitation of our study is that cases and commu-
nity controls were derived from different studies and assessed 
using telephone interviews for controls and personal inter-
views and clinical assessments for cases. This may, on the 
one hand, cause an underreporting of vascular risk factors 
in controls. On the other hand, it may result in potentially 
different definitions of risk factors as, for example, alcohol 
consumption and BMI, and may, therefore, have caused bias. 
However, through careful post hoc harmonization of risk 
factor information, we think that sufficiently comparable 
data on 8 modifiable risk factors were available for cases and 
controls. For example, in sensitivity analyses using BMI val-
ues that were corrected for potential bias from self-reports 
in GEDA and a different definition of heavy episodic alco-
hol consumption, total PAR of all risk factors combined did 
not materially change, and changes to individual PAR were 
small. Not all important risk factors could be included in this 
analysis because some were not assessed in controls, such 
as atrial fibrillation. However, in line with other studies,38 
atrial fibrillation had a prevalence of only 2.6% in cases and 
is, therefore, unlikely to have contributed on a large scale to 
stroke in our study. Some other important risk factors that 
could not be examined include waist-to-hip ratio, diet, or 
psychosocial factors, such as depression. A final limitation is 
that the size of subgroups is sometimes small (eg, for PICH, 
younger age groups, and TOAST subgroups).
Implications of Findings
Stroke in the young may be associated with nonatheroscle-
rotic arteriopathies (most commonly dissection; present in 
9.9% of SIFAP patients), rare genetical disorders (such as 
CADASIL [Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy 
With Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy], 
Fabry, and MELAS [Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathy, 
Lactic Acidosis, and Stroke-Like Episodes]; confirmed 
to be rare in SIFAP), and a long list of other rare causes. 
However, our study adds to the increasing evidence that 
established modifiable risk factors of stroke are indeed 
related to a major proportion of stroke in young adults, 
even in a similar magnitude as in older stroke patients.13,14 
Even though the true impact of lifestyle interventions 
requires further study in controlled trials, our results sug-
gest that a more active, healthy lifestyle would reduce the 
number of young stroke patients and reduce stroke burden 
on the level of the individuals and the population. Yet, this 
does not contradict existing evidence that stroke in young 
subjects is more often caused by rare causes of stroke. 
Stroke in young adults differs from stroke in elderly. First, 
the distribution of etiologic subtypes is different, suggest-
ing different etiologic mechanisms. Second, even though 
traditional risk factors do contribute to stroke incidence in 
young, their relative contribution is smaller in young stroke 
patients, as can be extrapolated from our age subgroup 
analyses. Interestingly, behavioral risk factors alone seem 
to play a role in the youngest age group, such as alcohol 
consumption and low physical activity. Therefore, young 
stroke patients constitute a separate patient group, even 
though traditional risk factors should not be overlooked in 
research, clinical, and a public health setting.
Conclusions
Risk factors for stroke previously established in older pop-
ulations also account for a large part of stroke in younger 
adults. Targeted population-based risk factor prevention 
measures and interventions may have a substantial effect in 
reducing stroke in the young. As all risk factors included in 
the study are either modifiable through behavioral change 
or treatment, the study results have high relevance for the 
planning of preventive measures in the German population 
and governmental and health sector actions on prevention of 
stroke in the population.
