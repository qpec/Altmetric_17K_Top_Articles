IMPORTANCE Cervical cancer can be prevented with detection and treatment of
precancerous cell changes caused primarily by high-risk types of human papillomavirus
(hrHPV), the causative agents in more than 90% of cervical cancers.
OBJECTIVE To systematically review benefits and harms of cervical cancer screening for
hrHPV to inform the US Preventive Services Task Force.
DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, PubMed, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Collaboration Registry
of Controlled Trials from January 2011 through February 15, 2017; surveillance
through May 25, 2018.
STUDY SELECTION Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and cohort studies comparing primary
hrHPV screening alone or hrHPV cotesting (both hrHPV testing and cytology) with cytology
(Papanicolaou [Pap] test) screening alone.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Two investigators independently reviewed abstracts and
full-text articles and quality rated included studies; data were qualitatively synthesized.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Invasive cervical cancer; cervical intraepithelial neoplasia
(CIN); false-positive, colposcopy, and biopsy rates; psychological harms.
RESULTS Eight RCTs (n = 410 556), 5 cohort studies (n = 402 615), and 1 individual participant
data (IPD) meta-analysis (n = 176 464) were included. Trials were heterogeneous for
screening interval, number of rounds, and protocol. For primary hrHPV screening, evidence
was consistent across 4 trials demonstrating increased detection of CIN 3 or worse (CIN 3+)
in round 1 (relative risk [RR] range, 1.61 [95% CI, 1.09-2.37] to 7.46 [95% CI, 1.02-54.66]).
Among 4 hrHPV cotesting trials, first-round CIN 3+ detection was not significantly different
between screening groups; RRs for cumulative CIN 3+ detection over 2 screening rounds
ranged from 0.91 to 1.13. In first-round screening, false-positive rates for primary hrHPV
screening ranged from 6.6% to 7.4%, compared with 2.6% to 6.5% for cytology. For
cotesting, false-positives ranged from 5.8% to 19.9% in the first round of screening,
compared with 2.6% to 10.9% for cytology. First-round colposcopy rates were also higher,
ranging 1.2% to 7.9% for primary hrHPV testing, compared with 1.1% to 3.1% for cytology
alone; colposcopy rates for cotesting ranged from 6.8% to 10.9%, compared with 3.3% to
5.2% for cytology alone. The IPD meta-analysis of data from 4 cotesting trials and 1 primary
hrHPV screening trial found lower risk of invasive cervical cancer with any hrHPV screening
compared with cytology alone (pooled RR, 0.60 [95% CI, 0.40-0.89]).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Primary hrHPV screening detected higher rates of CIN 3+
at first-round screening compared with cytology. Cotesting trials did not show initial
increased CIN 3+ detection. Both hrHPV screening strategies had higher false-positive and
colposcopy rates than cytology, which could lead to more treatments with potential harms.

igh-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) is readily trans-
mitted through sexual contact1,2 and is recognized as a
causative agent in more than 90% of cervical cancers.3
Persistent infection with hrHPV types 16 and 18 is responsible for
most cases.4,5 Although a high proportion of sexually active
women become infected with some human papillomavirus type
by age 25 years, most infections resolve spontaneously.6 Effec-
tive screening and treatment for precancerous lesions are associ-
ated with low rates of cervical cancer mortality in the United
States.7 Annual age-adjusted cervical cancer incidence in the
United States was 7.4 cases per 100 000 women and mortality
was 2.3 deaths per 100 000 women (2011-2015), with the high-
est incidence among black (8.4 per 100 000) and Hispanic (8.9
per 100 000) women. Black women also had the highest mortal-
ity rate (3.7 deaths per 100 000 women).8
In 2012, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) rec-
ommended screening women aged 21 to 65 years for cervical
cancer with cytology (Papanicolaou [Pap] smear) every 3 years,
with an option for women 30 years and older for hrHPV co-
testing (cytology and cervical swab for hrHPV) every 5 years
(A recommendation).9 This systematic review, conducted to
update evidence on cervical cancer screening, focused on the
effectiveness of hrHPV screening strategies relative to cytology-
based screening to support an updated USPSTF recommendation.
Methods
Scope of Review
Cytology is the foundation for long-standing cervical cancer
screening recommendations, with well-established benefits and
harms. The USPSTF commissioned this review to evaluate direct
evidence from trials and large observational cohort studies on the
comparative effectiveness of screening approaches that use
hrHPV screening. Specifically, the 2 key questions (KQs) (Figure 1)
aimed to identify the benefits (KQ1) and harms (KQ2) of cervical
cancer screening using hrHPV screening alone as the initial test
(primary screening) or paired with cytology (cotesting), com-
pared with screening with cytology as the primary test. Additional
methodological details regarding the review search strategies,
including detailed study inclusion criteria, excluded studies, and
description of data analyses, are available in the full evidence
report at https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page
/Document/UpdateSummaryFinal/cervical-cancer-screening2.
Data Sources and Searches
Comprehensive literature searches were performed for primary lit-
erature in MEDLINE, PubMed, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Col-
laboration Registry of Controlled Trials from January 2011 through
February 15, 2017, bridging from the dates of the previous USPSTF
review.11 Database searches were supplemented with experts’sug-
gestions and by reviewing reference lists from other relevant sys-
tematic reviews. After February 2017, ongoing surveillance contin-
ued through article alerts and targeted searches of high-impact
journals to identify major studies published in the interim that
could affect the conclusions or understanding of the evidence and
the related USPSTF recommendation. The last surveillance was
conducted on May 25, 2018, and resulted in the addition of the
initial results of the Compass trial.12 The final results of the HPV
FOCAL trial, published in JAMA in July 2018, have also been incor-
porated in this review.13
Study Selection
Two reviewers independently reviewed 2972 unique citations and
164 full-text articles against specified inclusion criteria (Figure 2).
Discrepancies were resolved through consensus and consultation
with a third investigator when required.
Eligible studies were rated as fair or good quality, published in
English, and conducted in highly developed countries.15 Quality
assessment criteria are reported in eTable 1 in the Supplement.
Studies had to be conducted in primary care or generalizable set-
tings (eg, family planning clinics); studies based on laboratory
results alone without an identified cohort were excluded. Ran-
domized clinical trials (RCTs), individual participant data (IPD)
meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and large ( � 10 000 women)
longitudinal cohort studies that examined the benefits or harms
of primary hrHPV screening or cotesting among average-risk
women 21 years and older were included. Studies in women
without a cervix, at high risk for cervical cancer, or who were
pregnant were excluded. Studies evaluating hrHPV as a triage
test after cytology compared with cytology alone were ex-
cluded. Cohort studies including fewer than 10 000 women were
excluded, unless they addressed a subpopulation of interest
(eg, underscreened women).
Invasive cervical cancer generally develops over years, pre-
ceded by progressive precancerous changes of the cervix, defined
as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) categorized as CIN 1, CIN
2,andCIN3.16ForKQ1,becauseinvasivecervicalcancerisarareevent
incountrieswithorganizedscreeningprogramssuchthatevenlarge
trialsdidnothavesufficientsamplesizeordurationtodetectchanges
in invasive cervical cancer incidence, CIN 3 or worse (CIN 3+) was
chosen as the primary outcome. CIN 3+ was consistently reported
because of broad consensus that detection and treatment of CIN 3
can prevent progression to invasive cervical cancer. For KQ2, stud-
ies were included if they reported false-positive CIN 2+ or false-
negativeinvasivecervicalcancerscreeningtestresults;biopsyrates,
colposcopy rates, or both; or psychological harms (eg, labeling,
stigma, distress, quality of life).
Data Extraction and Quality Assessment
Two investigators independently assessed the quality of included
studies using USPSTF design-specific criteria for RCTs17 and the
Newcastle-OttawaScaleforobservationalstudies.18Eachstudywas
rated as good, fair, or poor (eTable 1 in the Supplement). Disagree-
mentsinqualityratingswereresolvedbyconsensusandbyconsul-
tationwithathirdinvestigatorifrequired.Poor-qualitystudieswith
majorflaws(eg,attrition>40%,differentialattrition>20%)ormul-
tipleimportantlimitationsthatcouldinvalidatetheresultswereex-
cluded. One investigator extracted study-level data (study design
details,populationandinterventioncharacteristics,outcomes)into
standardized evidence tables and a second investigator confirmed
the accuracy of the data.
Data Synthesis and Analysis
Because of the heterogeneity of screening tests, screening proto-
cols, follow-up protocols, and settings, results were qualitatively

 synthesized. Summary tables of study design, population charac-
teristics, protocols, and intervention and follow-up details for each
round of screening were created. Results were synthesized by KQ
and screening strategy, either primary hrHPV screening or cotest-
ing.Whenpossible,resultswerealsostratifiedbyage(<30-35years
vs �30-35 years) because of lower prevalence of hrHPV in women
30 years and older. Results were based on a “number of women
screened”denominator, rather than intention-to-treat calcula-
tions using all women randomized. Relative risks (RRs) and 2-sided
95%confidenceintervalswerecalculatedwhennotreportedinthe
study. Stata version 15.1 (StataCorp) was used for all analyses.
To estimate potential harms or burden of screening, test posi-
tivity,colposcopyrates,andfalse-positiverateswerereportedorcal-
culated from available data. The false-positive rate was reported to
quantify the extent to which women in a cervical cancer screening
program experienced positive screening test results necessitating
further follow-up (ie, triage testing, repeat screening, colposcopy,
andbiopsy)andwerenotfoundtohaveprecancerouslesionsorcer-
vical cancer (ie, CIN 2+). This was calculated as the number with a
positive screening test result without diagnosis of CIN 2+ as a pro-
portion of women screened who were not diagnosed with CIN 2+.
This pragmatic definition relies on colposcopy as a reference stan-
dard, recognizing that there is variability in the accuracy of colpos-
copy and biopsy.19 False-negatives were defined as the proportion
ofinvasivecervicalcancercasesoccurringamongwomenwithnega-
tiveprecedingscreeningresults.Psychologicalharms,includingad-
verse effects on anxiety, distress, and sexual satisfaction, were ab-
stracted when reported.

Effectiveness of Screening
Key Question 1. What is the effectiveness of human papillomavirus
for hrHPV testing, with or without cytology, as a primary screening
strategy for reducing cervical cancer mortality and incidence com-
paredwithcurrentlyrecommendedscreeningstrategiesforwomen
in the United States?
Four fair- or good-quality cervical cancer screening RCTs were
identified that compared primary hrHPV screening with cytology
(n = 282 838),12-14,19-23 and 4 RCTs compared cotesting with cytol-
ogy (n = 127 717) (Table 1).14,25-35 One IPD meta-analysis combined
176 464 women from 1 primary hrHPV screening trial and 4 hrHPV
cotesting trials to examine invasive cervical cancer incidence.47
Four large cohort studies were included: 1 of primary hrHPV screen-
ing (n = 48 736),24 2 of cotesting (n = 351 613),36-42,48,49 and 1
reporting on cotesting outcomes in 1832 unscreened women.42
Trials varied in the number of reported screening rounds (1 or 2),
the screening interval (3-5 years), consistency between screening
rounds (eg, randomization maintained, cytology only or cotesting
for both intervention and control groups in the second screening
round), and the protocols for evaluation of abnormal screening
results. For primary hrHPV screening, follow-up varied and
included cytology triage from a specimen obtained at the time of
initial screening and held, hrHPV genotyping with follow-up based
on viral type, or immediate colposcopy (Table 1). Four RCTs offered
consistent evidence that primary hrHPV screening will detect

 higher rates of CIN 3+ at an initial screening round compared with
cytology, while trials of cotesting did not show initial increased
CIN 3+ detection at round 1. Data on mortality from cervical cancer
were not reported in any included studies.
Primary hrHPV Compared With Cytology Screening
Across 4 trials with variable protocols and hrHPV test types, con-
ducted in women aged 25 to 65 years, evidence was consistent in
demonstratingthatprimaryhrHPVscreeningledtoastatisticallysig-
nificant increased detection of CIN 3+ in the initial round of screen-
ing (RR range, 1.61 [95% CI, 1.09-2.37]) to 7.46 [95% CI, 1.02-
54.66]) (Table 2).12,13,19,21,22 The New Technologies for Cervical
Cancer (NTCC) Phase II trial of primary hrHPV screening (in which
all women with a positive hrHPV test result were referred to col-
poscopy) had complete results from 2 rounds of screening, but the
screening strategy was not maintained (at round 2 screening, all
women received cytology testing).14,20 In that study, CIN 3+ detec-
tioninround1was3timeshigherinthehrHPVscreeninggroup,with
cumulative detection 1.8 times higher after the second round of
screening.Intherecentlypublished48-monthscreeningresultsof
the HPV FOCAL trial, all women received cotesting at the second
roundofscreening.13CIN3+detectioninthehrHPVscreeninggroup
was higher in round 1 (RR, 1.61 [95%CI, 1.09-2.37]) but significantly
lowerinround2(RR,0.42[95%CI,0.25-0.69]).Resultsofasingle-
group cohort study of primary hrHPV screening at 3-year intervals
were consistent with trial findings (eTable 2 in the Supplement).24
Cotesting Compared With Cytology Screening
Four cotesting trials followed up enrolled women aged 25 to 64
years through 2 rounds of screening, but only 1 trial (A Random-
ized Trial in Screening to Improve Cytology [ARTISTIC]) main-
tained the randomly assigned screening protocol in the second
round (Table 1).32-35 None of the trials demonstrated significantly
higher detection of CIN 3+ with cotesting in the first round of
screening, with the RR ranging from 0.96 (95% CI, 0.74-1.23) to
1.31 (95% CI, 0.92-1.87) (Table 2). By the second round of screen-
ing 3 to 5 years later, CIN 3+ detection in 2 trials was significantly
lower, with RRs ranging from 0.53 (95% CI, 0.29-0.98)30,31 to
0.73 (95% CI, 0.55-0.96).27-29 Cumulative detection of CIN 3+
over 2 rounds was similar in all trials, with no RR significantly dif-
ferent than 1.0. Long-term follow-up was reported for 2 cotesting
trials: the Swedescreen trial reported up to 13 years by tracking
study participants in the National Quality Registry for Cervical
Cancer Prevention,31 and the Population-based Screening Study
Amsterdam (POBASCAM) trial reported 14 years of follow-up
tracked through the nationwide network and registry of histopa-
thology and cytopathology.29 In both studies, no statistical differ-
ence in cumulative CIN 3+ rates was detected between the inter-
vention and control groups.
Two large single-group cohort studies of cotesting showed
higher detection of CIN 3+ in the first screening round relative to a
follow-up round (eTable 2 in the Supplement).24,37,43,44 Long-term

 cotesting negative was very low 3 and 5 years after testing (0.06%
and 0.1%, respectively).49
To examine the effect of hrHPV screening on invasive cervical
cancer in cervical cancer screening trials, Ronco et al conducted an
IPD meta-analysis of 5 trials: 4 trials of cotesting and a single trial of
primary hrHPV screening (NTCC Phase II).47 Participant data were
pooled,althoughthesetrialshaddistinctlydifferentscreeningpro-
tocols, screening intervals, and hrHPV test types. The IPD meta-
analysisincluded176 464womenwith1 214 415person-yearsoffol-
low-up,withatotalof107casesofinvasivecervicalcancerinamedian
follow-upperiodof6.5years.Cumulativedetectionofinvasivecer-
vical cancer was 46.7 per 100 000 in the hrHPV-screened women,
compared with 93.6 per 100 000 women in the cytology groups.
With a random-effects model, the overall pooled rate ratio for inva-
sive cervical cancer in the hrHPV-screened women was 0.61 (95%
CI, 0.41-0.91). The I2 test for statistical heterogeneity was not sig-
nificant (0.0%, P = .52).
Key Question 1a. Does the effectiveness of hrHPV testing to re-
ducecervicalcanceroutcomesvarybysubpopulation(eg,age,race/
ethnicity,screeninghistory,hrHPVimmunizationstatus,andsocio-
economic status)?
No trials provided data on race/ethnicity, screening history, or
socioeconomic status for primary hrHPV screening. Several stud-
ies reported on outcomes by age group (eTables 3 and 4 in the
Supplement),and1studyreportedonoutcomesbyagecorrespond-
ing to the introduction of a population-based hrHPV immunization
program.12 One cohort study reported outcomes of a single round
of cotesting in underscreened women.42
Primary hrHPV Compared With Cytology Screening Stratified by Age
In 4 trials of primary hrHPV screening, first-round CIN 3+ detection
with hrHPV screening was consistently higher (range, 0.6%14,20 to
2.4%13,19,21,22)amongwomenyoungerthan35years(eTable4inthe
Supplement) than for women older than 35 years (range, 0.2%23 to
0.5%13,19,21,22) (eTable 3 in the Supplement). The RR for CIN 3+ de-
tectionbetweenscreeninggroups,however,wassimilartotheover-
all findings in both the younger (<30-35 years) and older (�30-35
years)agegroups.IntheCompasstrial,12participantswererecruited
from a population having 70% hrHPV vaccination coverage among
women 33 years and younger. Primary hrHPV screening detected
higher rates of CIN 3+ compared with cytology for both the younger
(25-33 years) and older (34-64 years) age groups. Absolute detec-
tion rates were higher for women younger than 30 to 35 years, re-
gardless of the screening test, in all primary hrHPV screening trials.
Cotesting Compared With Cytology Screening Stratified by Age
Three trials of cotesting reported outcomes by age group (eTables
3 and 4 in the Supplement). CIN 3+ detection was higher in women
younger than 30 to 35 years compared with older women, but no
trialfoundasignificantlyhigherRRforcotestingcomparedwithcy-
tologyamongwomenyoungerthan30to35years.Amongwomen
35 years and older, only NTCC Phase I had a significantly higher RR
for cotesting compared with cytology at round 1 (RR, 1.57 [95% CI,
1.02-2.43]). The effect estimates for CIN 3+ detection between
screeninggroupsweregenerallysimilaracrossagegroups,withthe
exception of NTCC Phase I, with an RR of 0.89 (95% CI, 0.51-1.57)
forwomenyoungerthan35yearsand1.57(95%CI,1.02-2.43)among
women 35 years and older.
Gageetalpublishedanage-stratifiedanalysisof1 313 128women
in a large US-based cohort who were screened for cervical cancer
with cotesting from 2003 to 2013.50 The 5-year risk of CIN 3+ was
highest for women aged 25 to 29 years (1.23% [95% CI, 1.09%-
1.39%]) and lowest for women aged 50 to 64 years (0.25% [95%
CI, 0.22%-0.28%]).
In summary, while risks of hrHPV-positive results were consis-
tently higher in women younger than 30 to 35 years, in most stud-
iesdifferencesinCIN3+detectionbetweenscreeningmethodswere
consistent across age groups.
Screening With hrHPV Cotesting in Underscreened Populations
A prospective single-cohort study from Spain described the out-
comes of initial cotesting in a cohort of 1832 women older than 39
years with no documented cervical cancer screening in the previ-
ous5years.42Nocomparisongroupwasincluded,andwomenolder
than 65 years were excluded after receiving negative initial cotest-
ing results. Of 1494 remaining women, 767 (51.3%) completed fol-
low-up.NinewomenwerediagnosedwithCIN3+,and2womenhad
invasive cervical cancer (eTable 2 in the Supplement). Two women
with CIN 3 were detected only by the hrHPV test.
KeyQuestion1b.Foreachprimaryscreeningstrategy,howdoesthe

Data were not adequate to compare outcomes of different re-
screeningintervals.Onetrial(HPVTestingforCervicalCancerScreen-
ing[HPVFOCAL])13,19,21,22wasdesignedtodirectlycomparediffer-
entrescreeningintervals(2yearsforcytologyvs4yearsforprimary

roundscreencomparedwiththecytologygroup(0.2%vs0.6%;RR,
0.42 [95% CI, 0.25-0.69]) (Table 2).13 The POBASCAM trial with
5-year screening intervals exhibited CIN 3+ detection and RRs for
cotesting similar to those reported in cotesting trials with 3-year
screening intervals.27-29 In 13- to 14-year follow-up of the Swede-

Recently published analyses of the large US-based cotesting
cohort48,49 evaluated the risk of CIN 3+ and invasive cervical can-
cer at 3 and 5 years after screening and found that after a negative
hrHPV test result (regardless of the cytology result), risk of subse-
quent CIN 3+ was very low at 5 years (0.114% [95% CI, 0.106%-
0.122%]) and only slightly lower at 3 years (0.085% [95% CI,
0.079%-0.092%]). Women with a negative cotesting result fol-
lowed by a second negative hrHPV test result had risks of CIN 3+ of
0.04% (95% CI, 0.04%-0.05%) at 3 years and 0.06% (95% CI,
0.05%-0.07%) at 5 years. For each of 3 age groups (30-39, 40-49,
and �50 years), each consecutive negative hrHPV test result was
associated with progressively lower risk of CIN 3+. No cases of in-
vasive cervical cancer were detected.48

 Harms of hrHPV Screening
KeyQuestion2.WhatarethepotentialadverseeffectsofhrHPVtest-
ing, with or without cytology, as a primary screening strategy com-
paredwithcurrentlyrecommendedscreeningstrategiesforwomen
in the United States?
The same 8 RCTs,12-14,19-23,25-35 IPD meta-analysis,47 and 3 ob-
servationalcohortstudiesdescribedabove24,37,44wereincludedfor
harms, along with an additional cross-sectional study that assessed
psychologicalharmsamong428women.45Studiesreportedscreen-
ing test performance (ie, false-negative and false-positive results),
procedures conducted to evaluate positive screening test results
(ie, colposcopy and biopsy), and potential psychological harms
(eg, quality of life, anxiety or distress, partner discord). Overall,
screeningwithhrHPVprimaryorcotestingwasassociatedwithmore
false-positive results and higher colposcopy rates. Limited evi-
dence suggested that positive hrHPV test results may be associ-
ated with greater psychological harm than abnormal cytology re-
sults.Noneoftheincludedstudiesreportedonharmsoccurringfrom
the screening test, diagnostic testing, or treatments.
Primary hrHPV Screening
Trial differences in the protocol for follow-up of positive hrHPV
screening test results affected colposcopy and false-positive rates.
In the NTCC Phase II protocol, all hrHPV-positive results were
referred directly to colposcopy.14,20 Accordingly, the false-positive
rate for CIN 2+ was higher with hrHPV screening (7.4% vs 3.2%),
as was the colposcopy rate (7.9% vs 2.8%), than with cytology
screening in the trial (Table 3). Most women referred to colpos-
copy underwent the procedure (93.6% in the intervention group,
90.6% in the control group), and more women in the hrHPV
screening group underwent biopsy (3.2% vs 1.3% in the control
group). The HPV FOCAL trial used a liquid-based cytology triage
strategy for hrHPV-positive results.13,19,21,22 In round 1 of screen-
ing, 5.7% of women in the hrHPV testing group were referred to
colposcopy, compared with 3.1% in the cytology-only control
group, and 94.1% of the trial participants referred to colposcopy
attended.13 Colposcopy referral rates in round 1 of the Compass
trial for hrHPV screening compared with cytology screening were
3.8% vs 2.7%.12 In the FINNISH trial,23 primary hrHPV screening
false-positive rates (7.2%) and colposcopy referral rates (1.2%)
were similar to cytology screening false-positive (6.5%), and col-
poscopy referral (1.1%) rates. In 3 trials reporting age-stratified
results, colposcopy referrals in round 1 of screening for women
younger than 30 to 35 years ranged from 2.3% to 13.1% with
hrHPV testing, compared with a range from 1.9% to 4.7% for
cytology screening (eTable 7 in the Supplement). Among women
older than 30 to 35 years, colposcopy referrals ranged from 0.9%
to 5.8% for hrHPV testing, compared with 1.0% to 2.5% for cytol-
ogy screening (eTable 6 in the Supplement).
False-negativeresultsforinvasivecervicalcancer(basedonin-
terval detection) were uncommon. The NTCC Phase II trials re-
ported no CIN 3 or invasive cervical cancer cases among screen-
negativewomenineithergroupinfollow-upafterthefirstroundof
screening (3.5 years maximum).14,20 The larger FINNISH trial re-
ported invasive cervical cancer among screen-negative women in
0.01% (5/57 135) of the hrHPV testing intervention group partici-
pants and 0.003% (2/61 241) of the cytology control group partici-
pantsafter1roundofscreeningwith5yearsoffollow-up.23Dataon
invasive cervical cancer among screen-negative women were not
available for the HPV FOCAL or Compass trials.
No studies reported on the psychological effects of primary
hrHPV screening.
hrHPV Cotesting
Colposcopyrateswerereportedinonly2trialsofcotesting(ARTISTIC
and NTCC Phase I) (Table 3).32-35 In the ARTISTIC trial, higher false-
positive rates were observed with cotesting relative to the cytol-
ogyscreeningcontrolgroupatround1(19.9%vs10.9%)andround
2 (11.2% vs 4.6%). Colposcopy rates in round 1 were 6.8% in the co-
testing group and 5.2% in the cytology group.32-35 The proportion
ofwomenattendingcolposcopyandundergoingbiopsywasnotre-
ported. Only the NTCC Phase I trial reported age-stratified colpos-
copyandfalse-positiverates.Inthattrial,hrHPV-positivewomen35
years and older and those with results positive for atypical squa-
mous cells of undetermined significance were referred directly to
colposcopy;colposcopyrateswere3timeshigherforcotestingcom-
paredwithcytology(10.6%vs3.0%).14,25,26Ofthosereferred,94%
in the intervention group and 91% in the control group received a
colposcopy. For the Swedescreen trial,30,31 colposcopies were not
reported and false-positive rates could not be calculated. The
POBASCAM27-29 trial did not report colposcopy rates, but false-
positive rates were twice as high with cotesting (5.8% vs 2.6%) at
round1andsimilaratround2,inwhichboththeinterventiongroup
and the control group received cotesting (6.4% vs 6.5%).
The IPD meta-analysis obtained additional data from 5 trials
(4 trials of cotesting and a single trial of primary hrHPV screening)
and reported similar overall biopsy rates for women assigned to
hrHPVcotestingorprimarytestingcomparedwithcytologyinanaly-
sisofthePOBASCAM,Swedescreen,andARTISTICtrials,whichhad
a fixed-effects pooled rate ratio for biopsy of 1.02 (95% CI, 0.97-
1.07;I2 = 30.7%;P = .24).ApooledestimatecalculatedwiththeNTCC
trial biopsy rate included had unacceptably high statistical hetero-
geneity(I2 = 99.1%;P < .001).TherateratioforbiopsyfromtheNTCC
trials was 2.24 (95% CI, 2.09-2.39) with hrHPV testing, likely be-
cause of the direct-to-colposcopy triage protocol.47
False-negative rates were difficult to estimate. No invasive
cervical cancer cases were observed in screen-negative women
in either screening group in 2 studies,14,25,26,32-35 and 1 did not
report rates of invasive cervical cancer among screen-negative
women.30,31 In the POBASCAM trial, 1 case of invasive cervical can-
cer was detected in a screen-negative woman in the control group
and no cases in the intervention group, with 4 years follow-up on
the first screening round.27-29 In 14 years of long-term follow-up,
there were no statistically significant differences in incidence of
invasive cervical cancer among women in the intervention group
who screened hrHPV-negative and cytology-normal at baseline
and among those in the control group with normal cytology find-
ings at baseline.29 Findings of a large US-based cohort of women
who received cotesting suggested that hrHPV testing has few
false-negative cases of CIN 3+ detected by cytology: the 5-year risk
of CIN 3+ was 0.12% (95% CI, 0.11%-0.12%) for women testing
hrHPV-negative, compared with 0.10% (95% CI, 0.09%-0.10%)
for women with negative cotesting results.49

ing(n = 19 795),3.9%ofwomenwerereferredtocolposcopyatthe

Two included studies reported psychological effects of hrHPV
cotesting.32,45 In a substudy of the ARTISTIC trial,45 samples of
womenaged20to64yearsweresurveyedapproximately2weeks
afterreceivingscreeningresults(n = 2508).Womenassignedtothe
study intervention screening group who received hrHPV results in
addition to their cytology screening results reported lower sexual
satisfactionbutsimilarlevelsofdistressandanxietyintheshortterm.
A smaller cross-sectional study (n = 428) by McCaffery et al45 sur-
veyed women 1 week after they received cervical cancer screening
resultsandfoundthatforwomenwhounderwentcotestingandhad
normal cytology findings, those with hrHPV-positive results were
more distressed and anxious than women with hrHPV-negative re-
sults and had worse feelings about their current, past, and future
sexual partners regardless of cytology results.
Key Question 2a. Do the adverse effects vary by subpopulation
(eg, age, race/ethnicity, and hrHPV immunization status)?
Three primary hrHPV screening trials and 1 cotesting trial re-
portedage-stratifiedcolposcopyrates(eTables6and7intheSupple-
ment).Inalltrials,womenyoungerthan30to35yearsscreenedwith
primaryhrHPVtestingorcotestinghadhigherreferralratesforcol-
poscopy (range, 2.3%-13.1%) than women screened with cytology
(range,1.9%-4.7%).14,20,22,23IntheCompasstrialofprimaryhrHPV
screening, colposcopy referrals were higher with hrHPV screening
amongwomenaged25to33years(8.5%intheinterventiongroup
vs 4.7% in the control group) and lower for women aged 34 to 64
years (2.6% in the intervention group vs 2.2% in the control group)
in both screening groups, despite expected vaccination rates in
younger women of approximately 70%.12
KeyQuestion2b.Doadverseeffectsvarybyscreeningstrategy,in-
cluding by rescreening interval?
The influence of screening interval and strategy on potential
harms of missed cancer cases or possible overdetection could not
be directly ascertained from available evidence because of lack of
within–trialintervalcomparisonsandvariabilityofprotocolsacross
studies.Screeningintervalsofincludedtrialsrangedfrom2to5years,
with the longest intervals from FINNISH23 and POBASCAM.27-29
Thetrialswithlongerintervalsreportedsomeinvasivecervicalcancer
casesamongwomenwhohadtestedhrHPV-negative,butthesetrials
(FINNISH and POBASCAM) also had larger samples and there were
very few invasive cervical cancer cases overall, limiting inferences
that can be drawn from between-study comparisons. After 2 nega-
tive cotesting results, rates of invasive cervical cancer in the
US-based cohort were very low (0.003% [95% CI, 0.002%-
0.006%]) and equal at 3- and 5-year screening intervals.48
Discussion
A summary of the evidence for this review is shown in Table 4. Four
RCTs of primary hrHPV screening and 4 of cotesting (both hrHPV
testing and cytology) compared the use of hrHPV screening for cer-
vical cancer screening with cytology alone for the detection of
CIN 3+ and invasive cervical cancer. The evidence was consistent
across trials that primary hrHPV screening increased detection
of CIN 3+ in the initial round of screening by as much as 2 to 3 times
when compared with cytology. Evidence was mixed in cotesting
trials; CIN 3+ detection in round 1 was not significantly higher for
cotesting. No trials compared hrHPV primary testing with cotest-
ing. Evidence on subgroups was limited to age and a single-cohort
study focused on previously underscreened women. Women
younger than 35 years had consistently higher rates of hrHPV posi-
tivity and of CIN 3+, but the RR of CIN 3+ detection with primary
hrHPV screening or cotesting compared with cytology was similar
between younger and older women.
False-positive rates were higher in the intervention group for
both primary hrHPV screening and cotesting in the first screening
round. Colposcopy referrals were often reported but biopsy rates
were not, limiting estimation of the downstream harms of screen-
ing.In3primaryhrHPVscreeningtrialsandallcotestingtrials,rates
of colposcopy referral were higher in the intervention group, indi-
cating a greater relative burden with hrHPV screening and poten-
tial differences in downstream consequences of treatment com-
pared with screening cytology. Harms of treatment of the cervix to
remove precancerous cells were not reported in any of the in-
cluded studies but include pain and bleeding, which on rare occa-
sion requires vaginal packing or transfusion.52,53 Harms related to
subsequent pregnancy outcomes, particularly risk of second-
trimester pregnancy loss and preterm birth, may occur after cold
knife conization or loop electrosurgical excision procedure deeper
than 10 mm.54,55 Limited evidence suggested that, compared with
abnormalcytologyresults,hrHPVtestpositivitymaybeassociated
with greater short-term psychological harm.32-35
Cervical cancer incidence and mortality have substantially de-
creasedsincetheintroductionofscreeningprogramsmorethanhalf
a century ago; the lowest rates are found in countries with orga-
nizedscreeningprograms.AlloftheRCTsincludedinthisreviewwere
conducted in countries with robust, organized screening pro-
grams.Organizedscreeningprogramsarewell-suitedforcompara-
tivetrialsofscreeningstrategies;however,thegeneralizabilityoffind-
ingsfromthisreviewtowomenintheUnitedStatesislimitedbythe
lack of organized screening programs for the majority of US-based
women. Most cervical cancer screening in the United States is op-
portunistic, without population-based registries or regular invita-
tions to screening. More than 50% of women diagnosed with cer-
vicalcancerintheUnitedStateshavenotbeenscreenedintheprior
3 to 5 years.56 The highest proportions of unscreened women are
those without insurance (23.1%) or no regular clinician (25.5%).57
Cervical cancer predominantly affects underscreened women
in the United States; thus, a substantial effect on cervical cancer
incidence and mortality requires the identification of effective out-
reach strategies. Limited evidence from a single cohort study of
poorly screened women in Spain suggests that the increased
sensitivity of hrHPV screening may be particularly important
for early detection among underscreened women.42 Several
systematic reviews summarize evidence that hrHPV screening via
self-collection of samples may be a sufficiently accurate and
acceptable strategy for reaching underscreened and unscreened
populations.10,58,59 Further research is needed to examine the
effect of self-collection screening strategies on overall screening
rates, adherence to follow-up, and health outcomes for women
with limited access to health care or low rates of participation in
screening programs.60,61

 Limitations
This review was limited by the quality and heterogeneity of the in-
cludedstudies.First,thequalityofmanyoftheincludedstudieswas
rated as fair because of problems with attrition, protocol changes,
andlackofblindingofoutcomeassessment.Second,theoverallbody
of evidence was limited by trials having no more than 2 and often
only1randomizedroundofscreeningavailableforcomparisons.Only
1 trial (ARTISTIC) maintained the same strategy over 2 rounds of
screening.32-35 Third, outcome reporting on colposcopy and bi-
opsy rates was inconsistent, and none of the trials reported on ad-
verse events associated with the screening tests or with diagnostic
andtreatmentproceduresresultingfromscreening.Fourth,thetrial
evidence was supplemented with results of large cohort studies of
primaryhrHPVscreeningorcotestingover2screeningrounds;how-
ever, none of the cohort studies had a comparison group screened
with cytology only.
Conclusions
Primary hrHPV screening detected higher rates of CIN 3+ at first-
round screening compared with cytology. Cotesting trials did
not show initial increased CIN 3+ detection. Both hrHPV screen-
ing strategies had higher false-positive and colposcopy rates
than cytology, which could lead to more treatments with poten-
tial harms.
