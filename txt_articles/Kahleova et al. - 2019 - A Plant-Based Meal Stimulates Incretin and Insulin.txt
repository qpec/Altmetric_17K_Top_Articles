Abstract: Diminished postprandial secretion of incretins and insulin represents one of the key
pathophysiological mechanisms behind type 2 diabetes (T2D). We tested the effects of two energy-
and macronutrient-matched meals: A standard meat (M-meal) and a vegan (V-meal) on postprandial
incretin and insulin secretion in participants with T2D. A randomized crossover design was used
in 20 participants with T2D. Plasma concentrations of glucose, insulin, C-peptide, glucagon-like
peptide-1 (GLP-1), amylin, and gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP) were determined at 0, 30, 60,
120, and 180 min. Beta-cell function was assessed with a mathematical model, using C-peptide
deconvolution. Repeated-measures ANOVA was used for statistical analysis. Postprandial plasma
glucose responses were similar after both test meals (p = 0.64). An increase in the stimulated secretion
of insulin (by 30.5%; 95% CI 21.2 to 40.7%; p < 0.001), C-peptide (by 7.1%; 95% CI 4.1 to 9.9%; p < 0.001),
and amylin (by 15.7%; 95% CI 11.8 to 19.7%; p < 0.001) was observed following consumption of the
V-meal. An increase in stimulated secretion of GLP-1 (by 19.2%; 95% CI 12.4 to 26.7%; p < 0.001) and
a decrease in GIP (by −9.4%; 95% CI −17.3 to −0.7%; p = 0.02) were observed after the V-meal. Several
parameters of beta-cell function increased after the V-meal, particularly insulin secretion at a fixed
glucose value 5 mmol/L, rate sensitivity, and the potentiation factor. Our results showed an increase
in postprandial incretin and insulin secretion, after consumption of a V-meal, suggesting a therapeutic
potential of plant-based meals for improving beta-cell function in T2D.

1. Introduction
The role of diet in the development of glucose intolerance and progression to type 2 diabetes
(T2D) has been studied intensively [1–3]. Gastrointestinal hormones play a key role in glucose
metabolism, energy homeostasis, satiety, and regulation of body weight [4]. Incretin hormones, namely
glucagon-like peptide -1 (GLP-1) and gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP), which are released from the
small intestine in response to nutrient ingestion to enhance glucose-dependent insulin secretion, aid in
the overall maintenance of glucose homeostasis [5]. Furthermore, GLP-1 [6], and amylin [7] play a role
in energy intake through appetite regulation. The release of these satiety hormones depends on meal

composition. It has been suggested that particularly processed meat consumption leads to impaired
release of gastrointestinal hormones [8].
Prospective observational studies indicate a positive relationship between a high consumption of
red meat and T2D incidence [9,10]. This relationship is especially strong for processed meat. People
who eat any processed meats are one third more likely to develop diabetes compared with those who
do not consume any [11]. Several studies have pointed out a harmful effect of saturated fat on insulin
resistance, glycemic control [1,12], and cardiovascular disease [13]. In contrast, vegetarians are about
half as likely to develop diabetes, compared with non-vegetarians [14]. Randomized clinical trials
showed a greater improvement in insulin sensitivity and glycemic control with a plant-based diet
when compared with a conventional diet in participants with T2D [15,16].
We have investigated postprandial incretin and insulin secretion after ingestion of two meals
matched for energy and macronutrient content: a standard meat burger and a plant-based burger,
in men with T2D. Our hypothesis is that a plant-based meal stimulates the postprandial incretin and
insulin secretion. Our results provide insight into the pathophysiology of T2D and potentially help
build the evidence base for dietary recommendations for people with T2D.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Trial Design
This is a randomized crossover study of 20 men diagnosed with T2D, with two interventions.
Written informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to enrollment in the study. This study
was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Thomayer Hospital and Institute for Clinical and
Experimental Medicine in Prague, Czech Republic on August 13, 2014. The protocol identification
number is G14-08-42. The trial is prospectively registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (ID: NCT02474147).
2.2. Participants and Eligibility Criteria
Participants were men diagnosed with T2D aged between 30 and 65 years with a body mass index
between 25 and 45 kg/m2; treated by lifestyle alone or with oral hypoglycemic agents (metformin
and/or sulfonylureas) for at least one year, who had an HbA1c from ≥42 to ≤105 mmol/mol, (≥6.0 to
≤11.8%) and at least three symptoms of the metabolic syndrome. Exclusion criteria were renal, liver or
thyroid disease, drug or alcohol abuse, unstable drug therapy, or a significant weight loss of more than
5% of body weight in the last three months.
2.3. Randomization and Masking
Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to start with the vegan meal (V-meal) or
a meat sandwich (M-meal) based on a computer-generated randomization protocol by a study nurse.
The randomization protocol could not be accessed beforehand. The interventions were unmasked.
2.4. Interventions
The participants fasted overnight for at least 10 to 12 h and they did not take any of their diabetes
medication the evening or the morning before the assessments. The meal consisted of either a processed
meat burger (M-meal), or a plant-based tofu burger (V-meal). Meals were delivered fresh from the
manufacturer. Both meals were served with a hot drink: The M-meal with café latte and the V-meal
with green tea. Tap water was allowed ad libitum. Plasma concentrations of glucose, immunoreactive
insulin, C-peptide, incretins, and amylin were measured at baseline, at 30, 60, 120, and 180 min after
the meals. The participants came to our laboratory in the morning and, not knowing the sequence of
the interventions, they were assigned to start with one of the test meals according to the randomization
protocol. After a washout period of 1 week, the participants came back and completed the second
meal test.

2.5. Measurements
The primary outcome was the area under the curve (AUC) for postprandial insulin secretion.
The secondary outcome was the AUC for postprandial GLP-1 secretion. Tertiary outcomes included
insulin resistance and beta-cell function.
2.5.1. Anthropometric Measures and Blood Pressure
Height and weight were measured using a stadiometer and a periodically calibrated scale accurate
to 0.1 kg, respectively. Resting blood pressure was measured after participants had been in a seated
position for 5 min using a digital M6 Comfort monitor (Omron, Kyoto, Japan) three times at 2-min
intervals. A mean value was calculated from the last two measurements.
2.5.2. Metabolic Parameters
Plasma glucose was determined with the glucose-oxidase method using a Beckman Analyzer
(Beckman Instruments Inc., Fullerton, CA, USA). Serum immunoreactive insulin and C-peptide were
analyzed by radioimmunoassay using Immunotech Insulin and C-Peptide IRMA kits (Immunotech,
Prague, Czech Republic), and glycated hemoglobin was assessed by a Bio-Rad Haemoglobin A1c
Column Test (Bio-Rad Laboratories GmbH, Munich, Germany).
2.5.3. Gastrointestinal and Appetite Hormones
The concentrations of GLP-1 active, GIP, and amylin total were measured via multiplex
immunoanalyses based on xMAP technology using a Milliplex MAP Human Metabolic Hormone
Magnetic Bead Panel (HMHEMAG-34K) (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) and a Luminex 100 IS analyzer
(Luminex Corporation, Austin, TX, USA).
2.5.4. Beta-cell Function and Insulin Resistance
Beta-cell function was assessed by a mathematical model [17–19], as follows: Insulin secretory
rates were calculated from plasma C-peptide concentrations by deconvolution [17] and expressed
per square meter of estimated body surface area. The dependence of insulin secretory rates on
glucose concentrations was modeled separately for each participant and each diet. Insulin secretion
consists of two components.
The first represents the static dependence of insulin secretion on
glucose concentration and is characterized by a dose-response function. Relevant parameters include
insulin secretion at 5 mmol/L glucose (fasting glucose level) and mean slope in the glucose range.
The dose response is modulated by a potentiation factor, quantified as its ratio between 160 and
180, and 0 and 20 min values. The second component represents a dynamic dependence of insulin
secretion on the rate of change of glucose and is determined by the rate sensitivity [18,19]. The model
parameters (i.e., the parameters of the dose response, and the potentiation factor) were estimated from
glucose and C-peptide concentration by regularized least squares [17–19]. Regularization involves the
choice of smoothing factors that were selected to obtain glucose and C-peptide model residuals with
standard deviations close to the expected measurement error (~1% for glucose and ~5% for C-peptide).
Plasma insulin has been used for the assessment of insulin sensitivity, both in fasting and stimulated
conditions. Estimation of the individual model parameters was performed by an investigator masked
to group assignment.
Insulin resistance was calculated by the Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA-IR) index [20].
In addition, PREDIM index (Predicted clamp-derived insulin sensitivity index from a standard meal
test) was calculated as a measure of dynamic postprandial insulin sensitivity. It has been previously
validated against clamp-derived measures of insulin sensitivity [21].

2.6. Statistical Analysis
We estimated the sample size using a power calculation with an alpha of 0.05 and a power of 0.80 to
detect differences between the test meals in AUC for postprandial insulin secretion. This required 14
participants to complete both interventions. Using the trapezoid rule based on five time points (0, 30,
60, 120, and 180 min), we calculated the AUC for each plasma marker. We used repeated-measures
ANOVA to analyze the data. Spearman’s correlations were calculated to test the relationship between
postprandial changes in gastrointestinal hormones and changes in insulin secretion.
They were
calculated for the fasting plus for changes (30 to 0, 60 to 30, 120 to 60, and 180 to 120 min after ingestion
of standard breakfast): For each period separately, and then for all 5 values combined. Analyses
were undertaken using PASS 2005 statistical software (Number Cruncher Statistical Systems, Kaysville,
UT, USA), with the statistician blinded to the analyses. All results are presented as means with 95%
confidence intervals (CI).

3.1. Postprandial Glucose and Insulin Response
Postprandial plasma glucose responses were similar after both test meals (p = 0.64; Figure 1A).
An increase in the stimulated secretion of immunoreactive insulin (by 30.5%; 95% CI 21.2 to 40.7%;
p < 0.001; Figure 1B), C-peptide (by 7.1%; 95% CI 4.1 to 9.9%; p < 0.001; Figure 1C), and amylin (by 15.7%;
95% CI 11.8 to 19.7%; p < 0.001; Figure 1D) was observed following consumption of the V-meal.
3.2. Incretins
An increase in stimulated secretion of GLP-1 was evident (by 19.2%; 95% CI 12.4 to 26.7%; p < 0.001;
Figure 1E) after the V-meal. A decrease in postprandial concentrations of GIP (by −9.4%; 95% CI −17.3
to −0.7%; p = 0.02; Figure 1F) was observed after the V-meal. The detailed time flow of postprandial
concentrations of glucose, insulin, and incretins, are shown in Figure S2.

Parameters of beta-cell function and insulin resistance are shown in Table 3. Insulin secretion at
a fixed glucose value 5 mmol/L was higher after the V-meal by 11.4% (95% CI 1.6 to 22.4%; p = 0.04).
Rate sensitivity was increased after the V-meal by 55% (95% CI 3.0 to 132.1%; p = 0.04), and so was the
potentiation factor by 13.3% (95% CI 6.7 to 20.0%; p = 0.02). No differences between the meals were
observed in glucose sensitivity or insulin resistance assessed by HOMA-IR and PREDIM.

3.4. Correlations of Changes in Gastrointestinal Hormones with Glucose Metabolism
Postprandial secretion of GLP-1 and amylin increased in parallel with C-peptide concentrations in
each participant group in time span from 0 to 180 min after the meal ingestion, as shown in Figure S3.
A positive relationship was found between ∆ GLP-1 and ∆ C-peptide (r = 0.416, p < 0.001), and between
∆ amylin and ∆ C-peptide (r = 0.829, p < 0.001).
4. Discussion
Our study showed different postprandial incretin and insulin secretion following the ingestion of
a V-meal when compared with a standard M-meal, matched for energy and macronutrient composition.
Overall postprandial plasma glucose responses did not differ between meals, and we detected
significantly higher stimulated insulin and C-peptide responses, higher concentrations of GLP-1,
and lower levels of GIP, after the plant-based meal compared with the standard M-meal. Several
parameters of beta-cell function were improved after the plant-based meal, namely total insulin
secretion, insulin secretion at a fixed glucose value 5 mmol/L, rate sensitivity, and the potentiation
factor. No difference was observed in HOMA-IR or PREDIM as measures of insulin resistance.
4.1. Insulin Secretion and Beta-cell Function
That a single plant-based meal can increase postprandial insulin secretion has direct implication
for diabetes treatment. Preserving the capacity of beta-cells to produce insulin according to changing
need is a cornerstone in the treatment of diabetes [22]. Insulin secretion and beta-cell function may be
improved by different treatment options that lower body fat (such as diet and exercise, GLP-1 agonists,
or bariatric surgery) or change fat distribution (such as thiazolidinediones) [22,23]. As medications
and bariatric surgery are expensive and introduce potential side effects, lifestyle interventions should
be the first-choice treatment. It has been demonstrated that a 16-week vegan diet improves insulin

resistance and beta-cell function in overweight individuals, addressing both core pathophysiologic
mechanisms involved in diabetes at the same time [24].
4.2. Incretins
We observed an increase in postprandial GLP-1 concentrations and a decrease in GIP levels after
the V-meal. In addition, there was a strong positive relationship between the changes of GLP-1 and
changes in C-peptide secretion. The incretin release accounts for 50% to 70% of total postprandial
insulin secretion. GLP-1 has been primarily associated, together with GIP, with the incretin effect,
the postprandial augmentation of insulin secretion by gut hormones [25]. It is well understood that in
patients with diabetes, the incretin effect is diminished [26,27] due to impaired beta-cell sensitivity [28].
Several hypotheses have been formulated to explain loss of beta-cell sensitivity. Widely accepted
concepts include hyperglycemia- and hyperlipidemia-associated receptor desensitization [29].
We have demonstrated previously that a processed M-meal leads to postprandial hyperlipidemia,
increased lipoperoxidation, persistent postprandial hyperinsulinemia, and lower secretion of
gastrointestinal hormones, including GLP-1, compared with an energy-matched V-meal in people
with T2D [8]. Interestingly, in the previous study, V-meal resulted in higher GLP-1 and GIP secretion.
It has been shown that GIP secretion may also reflect the quality of carbohydrates [30], which may have
influenced the findings. The current study used cooked meat in the standard M-meal and we matched
both meals in macronutrient content in order to provide further insights into the pathophysiology of
incretin and insulin secretion in T2D. It is also important to note that some dietary interventions, such as
a whole grain diet, have been shown to improve beta-cell function independent of incretin secretion.
In this particular study, GLP-1 secretion was lower and GIP remained unchanged after 8 weeks of
a whole-grain diet compared with a refined-grain diet in people with prediabetes [31].
Several studies have suggested that a high intake of saturated fat naturally present in meat
contributes to the risk of glucose intolerance [1,12] due to impaired beta-cell sensitivity and function.
Fat quantity and quality have been shown to affect the gastrointestinal peptide release in people with
metabolic syndrome [32].
In addition to fat quality, carbohydrate quality needs to be taken into account. The V-meal
contained naturally more fiber and less sugar than the M-meal and these differences may have
influenced the findings [32].
Another important mechanism is replacing animal protein with plant protein, which has been
shown to reduce blood lipids and blood pressure [33], to lower fasting plasma glucose and fasting
insulin levels, and to improve glycemic control in diabetes [34]. It is important to note that in order to
see changes in fasting plasma glucose and insulin levels, a longer-term intervention is needed. As our
study was an acute feeding trial, we were only able to track the differences in postprandial changes.
Additionally, plant-foods are naturally rich in fiber, which may have influenced postprandial
insulin levels [35,36]. Furthermore, micronutrients, such as zinc [37], polyphenols [38], and other
phytochemicals may also have played their positive role in postprandial incretin and insulin secretion.
Our results are in line with these hypotheses and further demonstrate that a plant-based meal
may improve the secretion of incretins and insulin in people with T2D where secretion has already
been compromised.
The decreased postprandial plasma concentrations of GIP detected following ingestion of the
V-meal compared with the M-meal are a further positive finding, as increased levels of the anabolic
hormone GIP have been shown to directly promote fat storage and energy deposition [39]. While GLP-1
levels are usually diminished in T2D, GIP levels may be increased due to lowered beta-cell GIP-receptor
expression, resulting in GIP resistance in T2D [40]. Interestingly, not only dietary interventions,
but also metabolic surgery affects the secretion of incretins. For example, duodenal-jejunal bypass
liner, and endoscopic method that mimics small intestine mechanisms of a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass,
has also been shown to increase GLP-1 and decrease GIP concentrations [41]. Therefore, decreased
GIP concentrations in our study may reflect lower GIP resistance after the plant-based meal.
 Nutrients 2019, 11, 486

A consensus report by the American Diabetes Association and the European Association for
the Study of Diabetes recommends an incretin-based therapy (GLP-1 analogue or DPP-4 inhibitor)
following the failure of metformin monotherapy [42]. Improvement in beta-cell function is considered
one of the main benefits of incretin-based therapy [43]. Our data suggest that plant-based meals may
also improve beta-cell function, which may have important clinical implications for dietary treatment
of T2D.
4.3. Amylin
Amylin concentrations were higher after the V-meal, a result substantiated by the positive
relationship between changes in amylin and changes in C-peptide. Amylin is understood to regulate
both glucose and energy homeostasis [44] and is one of the prominent satiety signals, reducing eating
by promoting satiation [45]. Therefore, the increase in postprandial concentrations of amylin after the
V-meal observed in our study is a positive finding.
4.4. Strengths and Limitations
The main strength of this study is our comprehensive measurement of the postprandial state in
a physiological setting, after ingestion of two sandwiches. We identified the mechanisms behind the
improvements in glucose metabolism associated with plant-based diets. We recorded markers of both
signal and response to better consider the interplay of digestion and metabolism. Finally, our meals
were commonly consumed meals served in amounts corresponding to those ingested during a typical
meal, making the study results highly applicable and practical.
We also recognize several limitations. The diabetes duration was fairly short in our study
participants, increasing the likelihood to observe an increase in postprandial incretin and insulin
secretion. This observation may not be generalizable for people with T2D with a long duration of
the disease. Furthermore, our study included two test meals, and did not reflect habitual dietary
patterns. The differences in postprandial incretin and insulin secretion identified in this study suggest
that longer-term studies would be beneficial to show if a vegan diet may prevent the development
of diabetes or slow down diabetes progression. The meals differed in saturated fat, dietary fiber,
sugar content, amino acid composition, micronutrient content, polyphenols, and other phytochemicals,
all of which may have influenced our results. Additionally, although we used two hot caffeinated
drinks with both meals, coffee and green tea may have influenced glucose and insulin secretion slightly
differently [46]. Furthermore, we have not matched the meals in micronutrient content and have
not tested the bioavailability of these micronutrients after digestion of both meals. However, these
components are characteristic for plant-based meals compared with standard meals containing meat
and other animal products, so while this difference is not controlled for in this study, it does increase
the generalizability of our results.
5. Conclusions
In conclusion, our study results indicate an improvement in postprandial incretin and insulin
secretion in people with T2D, following consumption of a V-meal, suggesting a therapeutic potential
of plant-based meals for improving beta-cell function in T2D.
