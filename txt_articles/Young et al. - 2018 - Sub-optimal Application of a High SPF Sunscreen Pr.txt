SIGNIFICANCE
Skin cancer is an increasing public health burden in many 
countries. Most skin cancers are caused by DNA damage 
from ultraviolet radiation in sunlight. This study shows that 
a very high sun protection factor sunscreen can inhibit DNA 
damage in the skin caused by high doses of artificial sun-
light, even when the sunscreen is used less than optimally. 
The data suggest that sunscreen use is likely to reduce 
skin cancer and that there should be more emphasis in 
communicating how to best use sunscreens in public health 
campaigns.
The cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) is a potential-
ly mutagenic DNA photolesion that is the basis of most 
skin cancers. There are no data on DNA protection by 
sunscreens under typical conditions of use. The study 
aim was to determine such protection, in phototypes 
I/II, with representative sunscreen-user application. 
A very high SPF formulation was applied at 0.75, 1.3 
and 2.0 mg/cm2. Unprotected control skin was expo-
sed to 4 standard erythema doses (SED) of solar si-
mulated UVR, and sunscreen-treated sites to 30 SED. 
Holiday behaviour was also simulated by UVR exposu-
re for 5 consecutive days. Control skin received 1 SED 
daily, and sunscreen-treated sites received 15 (all 3 
application thicknesses) or 30 (2.0 mg/cm2) SED dai-
ly. CPD were assessed by quantitative HPLC-tandem 
mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) and semi-quantita-
tive immunostaining. In comparison with unprotected 
control sites, sunscreen significantly (p 
≤ 
0.001–0.05) 
reduced DNA damage at 1.3 and 2.0 mg/cm2 in all ca-
ses. However, reduction with typical sunscreen use 
(0.75 mg/cm2) was non-significant, with the exception 
of HPLC-MS/MS data for the 5-day study (p 
< 
0.001). 
Overall, these results support sunscreen use as a stra-
tegy to reduce skin cancer, and demonstrate that pu-
blic health messages must stress better sunscreen 
application to get maximal benefit. 
Key words: sunscreen; photoprotection; DNA protection; cyclo-
butane pyrimidine dimers.

S
olar ultraviolet radiation (UVR) causes skin cancers 
derived from epidermal melanocytes (melanoma) and 
keratinocytes (basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous 
cell carcinoma (SCC)). Skin cancer incidence is increa-
sing in many countries with predominantly fair-skinned 
populations (1, 2). Epidemiology has shown a relationship 
between sunburn (erythema) and malignant melanoma 
(MM), especially with childhood exposure (3). There is 
also evidence for such a relationship for BCC. The epi-
demiology for SCC supports a role for chronic low dose 
(sub-erythemal) solar UVR exposure (4).
Keratinocyte cancers (KC) are initiated by UVR-
induced DNA damage, in particular the cyclobutane py-
rimidine dimer (CPD) that results in characteristic C to T 
transition mutations in key regulatory genes such as p53 
(5). There is evidence for a role for such mutations in MM 
(6), though its molecular pathogenesis is more complex. 
Sunscreens increase the dose required to induce ery-
thema for which their index of efficacy is the sun protec-
tion factor (SPF) that is determined by exposing the skin 
to solar simulated radiation (SSR) with the sunscreen 
applied at 2 mg/cm2. However, sunscreens may not fully 
inhibit sunburn (7, 8). This is because people typically 
overestimate protection indicated by the label, by using 
much less sunscreen than 2 mg/cm2 with a commensurate 
reduction of actual SPF (9).
Sunscreen use is widely advocated as a means of re-
ducing skin cancer risk and this has been supported by a 
randomised trial of sunscreen use (SPF 16) which showed 
protective effects for actinic keratoses (AK) (10), and also 
for SCC (11) in a high-risk population in sub-tropical 
Australia. To date, there is no convincing evidence that 
sunscreen use has any significant impact on BCC. Meta-
analyses of several case-control studies have shown no 
effect of sunscreen use on melanoma (12). However, more 
recently, a reduction of melanoma in the same Australian 
study population as described above (13) and also a large 
prospective population-based study reported that use of 
sunscreens with SPF ≥ 15 vs SPF < 15 reduced the risk of 
melanoma (hazard ratio  0.67 (95% confidence interval 
(CI) 0.53–0.83) in Norway (14). Long-term sunscreen use 
has also been shown to inhibit photoageing (15). 
Prospective trials for skin cancer prevention by 
sunscreens are complex and the International Agency 
for Research on Cancer (IARC) identified the need for 
sunscreen studies on biomarkers, such as DNA damage,

that are predictive of cancer risk (16). A few studies have 
assessed the ability of sunscreens at 2 mg/cm2 to inhibit 
DNA photodamage in human skin in vivo but some have 
design flaws and other limitations (recently reviewed by 
Olsen et al. (17)), such as the use of non-solar UVB (280–
320 nm) sources, sampling too late after UVR exposure 
(e.g. 24–48 h and longer), when many/most lesions will 
have been repaired (18, 19), and using the same low UVR 
challenge dose for sunscreen-protected and unprotected 
skin that is a very undemanding test for a sunscreen. 
However, no study has assessed the effect of lowering 
sunscreen application thickness below 2 mg/cm2 on DNA 
protection, or on photoprotection in the basal layer that 
contains keratinocyte stem cells and melanocytes. We 
report on studies of which the primary aim was to assess 
the ability of a very high SPF sunscreen to inhibit overall 
epidermal CPD in sun sensitive skin types I/II after (i) a 
single SSR exposure and (ii) repeated SSR exposures to 
simulate a short holiday at tropical latitude. The secondary 
aim was to assess CPD in basal cell keratinocytes and 
melanocytes. Good ethical practice required that SSR 
doses on unprotected sites be sub-erythemal or borderline 
erythemal.  
METHODS
This study, approved by the Cambridge South, UK, Ethics Com-
mittee (ref: 13/EE/0268), was conducted in accordance with the 
Declaration of Helsinki, at St John’s Institute of Dermatology, 
London, UK from December 2013 to April 2014.
People use sunscreens to extend their intentional solar exposure 
time (20) so higher, but realistic, SSR doses were used on protected 
sites to ensure a robust test of the sunscreen in question. DNA pho-
todamage was assessed, in the same skin samples, by quantitative 
mass spectrometry and semi-quantitative immunostaining that 
enables damage location within the epidermis. The thymine dimer 
(TT) was chosen as the primary biomarker because it is the most 
frequent CPD (21, 22), but other di-pyrimidine lesions were also 
quantified in the acute study. Biopsies were taken immediately after 
irradiation (last irradiation in repeated exposure study) to minimise 
any confounding impact of DNA repair.
Volunteers
Sixteen healthy young phototype I and II volunteers were re-
cruited by internal advertisement and gave written informed 
consent before participation. There were two groups, each with  8 
persons (3 women, 5 men with one skin type I, and 7 skin types 
II). One group received a single UVR exposure (hereafter called 
the acute exposure group). The other received exposures on 5 
consecutive days (hereafter called the repeated exposure group). 
The mean 
± standard deviation (SD) ages of the acute and repeat 
exposure groups were 23 
± 3.7 and 25 
± 3.5 years, respectively. 
Irradiation: solar simulated radiation source and dosimetry
SSR was obtained from a Solar® Light 16S-001 v4.0 (Solar® Light, 
Glenside, Pennsylvania) and delivered by a liquid light guide (7 
mm exit diameter). The irradiance was spectroradiometrically 
determined (23) and the emission spectrum (Fig. 1) was compliant 
with the International Organization for Standardisation (ISO) Stan-
dard 24444 and Cosmetics Europe 2006. Irradiance was measured 
routinely with a Solar® Light PMA 2100 radiometer (Solar® Light, 
Glenside, Pennsylvania) after calibration by spectroradiometry. 
Exposure was expressed as standard erythema doses (SED). One 
SED was typically delivered in about 6 s. For comparison, Fig. 
1 also shows a simulated noon mid-summer solar spectrum from 
Tenerife (28.3° N, 16.6° W) (24). The SSR spectrum contains 
relatively less UVA1 (340–400 nm) than natural sunlight, but the 
overall UVA (320–400nm) erythemally effective energies (EEE) of 
each spectrum were similar; SSR = 13.2% and Tenerife = 15.2%. 
Experimental and analytical protocols
Sunscreen and application. The sunscreen (SPF 50+) was provided 
by Laboratoires Pierre Fabre (Toulouse, France). It complied with 
all relevant EU regulations with no evidence of phototoxicity. 
The filters were bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazine 
(Tinosorb S®), diethylhexyl butamido triazone (Uvasorb®HEB), 
butyl methoxydibenzoyl methane (Parsol®1789) and methylene 
bis-benzotriazolyl tetramethylbutylphenol (Tinosorb M®). The 
product also contained the antioxidant tocopheryl glucoside (pre-
tocopheryl®) (25). The mean 
± SD SPF (2 mg/cm2) was 64.0 
± 15.8 
and the in vitro UVA protection factor (UVA-PF) (ISO 24443 
Standard) was 25.3 with a critical wavelength of 379 nm. The 
mean ± SD SPFs at 0.75 and 1.3 mg/cm2 were 20.9 ± 3.3 and 
42.5 
± 8.4, respectively (Pierre Fabre Dermo-cosmetique internal 
files). 
The study site was the sun-protected upper buttock in which 
1 minimal erythema dose (MED) of SSR is ~3 SED in types II 
(23). The sunscreen was applied to three 5 × 7 cm2 zones of skin 
to achieve target application thicknesses of 2 mg/cm2, 1.3 mg/cm2 
and 0.75 mg/cm2. Each volunteer had a personally pre-assigned 
tube of sunscreen. The product was decanted onto a weighing boat 
per test site/per person and the boat was re-weighed after appli-
cation. The sunscreen was “spotted” evenly over the application 
area and then lightly spread transversely and then perpendicularly. 
This was done with a finger cot pre-applied with a small amount 
of sunscreen to prevent loss by absorption by the cot and a new 
finger cot was used for each sunscreen thickness. The mean 
± SD 
amounts (mg) applied (over 35 cm2) in the acute exposure study 
were 70.38 
± 0.74, 45.01 
± 0.54 and 26.03 
± 0.72 corresponding 
to 2.01, 1.29 and 0.74 mg/cm2, respectively. Comparable daily 
quantities were achieved in the repeated exposure study. Sum-
maries of the experimental set-up are shown in Fig. 2. In the 
acute exposure group, the sunscreen treated sites were exposed 
to 30 SED (~3 h tropical exposure). A positive control site, not

treated with sunscreen, was exposed to 4 SED and a completely 
untreated site served as a negative control. In the repeated SSR 
exposure group, treatments were given for 5 consecutive days. 
The daily dose was 15 SED with the sunscreen at 1.3 mg/cm2, 
0.75 mg/cm2 and 2 mg/cm2. An additional site with the sunscreen 
at 2 mg/cm2 was exposed to 30 SED/daily. One positive control 
site was exposed to 1 SED daily with no sunscreen. Irradiations 
were within 15 min of sunscreen application in both groups. The 
same procedure, dosing and application density was used for skin 
phototypes I and II. Sites were not randomised but all assessments 
of DNA damage were undertaken blinded.
Biopsy procedure
Punch biopsies (4 mm) were taken under local anaesthetic from 
the centre of each treated site. This was within 15 min of the 
single and 5th irradiations in the acute and repeated exposure 
groups respectively. 
The biopsies were trimmed to remove most of the dermis and 
divided into two halves. One half was analysed by immunostaining 
and the other by HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/
MS). There was one exception to this with the acute study, for 
which there was a full biopsy for each type of assay with the 
sunscreen application at 2 mg/cm2. Tissue for immunostaining was 
paraffin-embedded and cut into 4 µm sections. Tissue for HPLC 
was immediately snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80°C 
until transport on dry ice (temperature logged) to Grenoble, France 
and stored at –80°C until analysis. 
HPLC tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) 
The techniques have been previously described (26). Results were 
expressed as the number of bipyrimidine photoproducts/106 normal 
bases. The main analysis was for TT because they are the most 
frequent CPD. However, in the acute group, we also analysed TC 
and CT CPD, as well as TT and TC pyrimidine (6-4) pyrimidone 
photoproducts (6-4PP) and their Dewar photoisomers. 
Cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer immunostaining (keratinocytes 
and melanocyte double staining)
Sections were deparaffinised with xylene and microwaved for 12 
min in citrate buffer (pH6) (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, USA). Slides 
were then submerged in cold running tap water for 3 min, further 
washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated 
in 0.6% H202 and 0.1% triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. Slides 
were washed again in PBS, incubated for 45 min in blocking 
buffer (10% goat serum, 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% 
tween-20 in PBS) and further incubated with 2 monoclonal anti-
bodies overnight at 4°C. The 2 primary antibodies were Anti-CPD 
(Clone TDM-2) (Cosmobio, Tokyo, Japan) at 1:1000 and Anti-
TRP1 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) at 1:100 to identify melanocytes. 
Slides were washed twice in PBS and incubated with 2 secondary 
antibodies: Alexa Fluor goat anti-mouse 488 (Invitrogen, Paisley, 
UK) and Alexa Fluor goat anti-rabbit 555 (Invitrogen, Paisley, 
UK), both at 1:200 for 30 min. Slides were then washed 3 times 
(twice in PBS and once in distilled water) counterstained with 
prolong gold anti-fade with DAPI, cover-slipped and left at room 
temperature in the dark for 2 h prior to image capture. 
Fluorescence microscopy and image analysis
Image capture was carried out using a Zeiss Axio-Observer Z1 
Microscope (Carl Zeiss, Cambridge, UK) and AxioVision Rel. 
4.8 software (Carl Zeiss). All fluorescent channel exposures were 
measured at the beginning of each batch of pictures taken and 
remained constant throughout each experiment. All samples from 
a given volunteer were stained in the same batch, to minimize 
the effects of variation between stain runs, and all pictures from 
a given batch were captured at the same time. Three sections of 
each biopsy were stained and 3 photographs of each section were 
taken. We captured ~80 nuclei per photograph (termed whole 
epidermis) including ~20 basal keratinocytes and ~3 melanocytes, 
that were also assessed separately. 
Analysis was carried out using AxioVision Rel. 4.8 software 
(Carl Zeiss, Cambridge, UK). Analysis parameters were establi-
shed at the beginning of each sample batch to set the upper and 
lower limits of signal, which eliminated as much background 
staining as possible. For each individual picture, the regions 
included in analysis were checked and any dermal artefacts/cells 
were deleted. In the case of melanocyte/basal layer analyses all 
cells apart from those being analysed were deleted. The software 
gave a value for the mean intensity (grey scale) of each picture; 
i.e. TT/picture. Values for the positive controls of each person 
(SSR without sunscreen) were set at 100% and all other values 
were expressed as a percentage of this value because it was not 
possible to stain all biopsies in a single batch.
Statistical methods
The data were analyzed parametrically with STATA v12 (Stata-
Corp, College Station, Tx, US). The endpoints for the statistical 
assessment were %TT CPD relative to the no-sunscreen positive 
control (set at 100%) for the immunostaining markers, and number 
of TT CPD/106 normal bases in the HPLC-MS/MS assay. The ne-
gative controls (0 SED) sometimes gave a low level of background 
noise. A paired t-test was used to demonstrate the effect of SSR by 
comparing positive and negative controls. A one-sample t-test was 
used when the reference values were either 0% (i.e. no background 
noise) or 100%. Some sites treated with sunscreen and SSR had 
zero TT CPD values (DNA damage below the detection limit), 
which were included in the calculations because they show a high 
level of protection. The difference across experimental treatments 
was analysed using a repeated one-way ANOVA for 3 or more 
conditions. When ANOVA results suggested differences in mean 
values (p < 0.05) post hoc tests were performed to determine where 
these differences lay. The p values were adjusted for multiple 
comparisons using a Bonferroni correction, with significance set 
at p ≤ 0.05. The effect of sunscreen application thickness on the 
endpoints was assessed with a generalised estimating equation 
(GEE) approach to linear regression.

cm2 for which there were duplicate sites; one for HPLC/MS-MS and one 
for immunostaining.

RESULTS
Acute exposure group
Table I shows the results for all bipyrimidine photopro-
ducts assessed by HPLC-MS/MS. There were 31.1 
± 14.8 
TT CPD/106 bases with 4 SED compared with 6.0 
± 6.4 
with 30 SED and sunscreen at 2.0 mg/cm2. Thus, the 
sunscreen treated sites, with a 7.5 fold higher SSR dose, 
had ~20% of the DNA damage of the positive control. 
Fig. 3 shows representative immunostaining, with more 
CPD after 4 SED without sunscreen than 30 SED with 
sunscreen at 0.75 and 2.00 mg/cm2. All TT CPD data are 
shown in Fig. 4. The HPLC technique could not detect 
TT CPD in 3/8 and 5/8 test sites with sunscreen at 2.0 
and 1.3 mg/cm2 respectively (zero values included in the 
analyses), as was the case with immunostaining in some 
basal and melanocyte assessments (≤ 3/8). There were sig-
nificantly (p < 0.001) more TT CPD at 4 SED than 0 SED 
for all endpoints. ANOVA of all SSR treated sites/assays 
showed p < 0.001, except for melanocytes with p = 0.045. 
Table II shows the results of the Bonferroni-adjusted post 
hoc tests. There was significantly more damage for all 
endpoints with 4 SED without sunscreen than with 30 SED 
with sunscreen at 1.3 and 2.0 mg/cm2. The damage was 
also lower with the sunscreen at 0.75 mg/cm2 but the diffe-
rence was not significant for any endpoint. ANOVA of the

sunscreen treated sites/assays alone gave p-values from 
< 0.001 to 0.014 for all endpoints, except for melanocytes 
(p = 0.254). The Bonferroni adjusted post hoc test p-values 
for the comparisons between sunscreen treated sites show 
significant differences between 0.75 mg/cm2 and the other 
two application thicknesses (p < 0.001–0.035), but no dif-
ferences between 1.3 and 2.0 mg/cm2 (p = 0.145–0.999). 
The GEE analysis (Table II) showed a significant linear 
trend for TT CPD protection with increasing sunscreen 
application thickness except for melanocytes. 
Repeated exposure group
The analysis of the HPLC-MS/MS data was restricted 
to TT CPD because this was the most frequent lesion in 
the acute group (Table I). The trends for all endpoints are 
very similar (Fig. 5). Unlike the acute study, there were 
no HPLC/MS-MS samples with zero values. There were 
also no zero values in the immunostained samples with 1 
SED daily positive control exposures without sunscreen, 
and only 1 zero value (melanocytes) with the sunscreen 
at 0.75 mg/cm2. However, ≤ 4/8 of the other sunscreen 
treated samples had zero values. The highest numbers 
of zero values (overall epidermis, basal layer and mela-
nocytes) were seen with 15 SED daily and the sunscreen 
at 1.3 and 2.0 mg/cm2. Zero values were included in the 
analyses. Considerable DNA damage is seen immediately 
after the 5th consecutive 1 SED SSR exposure without 
sunscreen vs. 0 SED (p ≤ 0.002) for all assays. ANOVA 
of all SSR treated sites/assays showed p ≤ 0.014. The 
Bonferroni-adjusted post hoc tests are shown in Table II. 
There was significantly less damage with 15 SED/day with 
sunscreen at 1.3 and 2.0 mg/cm2 than 1 SED/day with no 
sunscreen for all assays. There was also less damage with 
the sunscreen at 0.75 mg/cm2, but this difference was only 
significant for the HPLC-MS/MS assay. A comparison of 
30 SED/day with the sunscreen at 2 mg/cm2 showed sig-
nificantly less damage than 1 SED/day without sunscreen 
for all assays. ANOVA of the sunscreen-treated sites/
assays alone showed no significant differences between 
any of the sunscreen treated sites (p = 0.054–0.437). How-
ever, GEE analysis showed a significant linear trend for 
increasing protection with increasing sunscreen thickness 
with 15 SED/day except for melanocytes. A paired t-test 
comparing 15 and 30 SED with the sunscreen at 2.0 mg/
cm2 showed less damage with 15 SED in all assays, but 
no difference was significant (p > 0.07). 
DISCUSSION
High solar UVR doses can be achieved at tropical and 
sub-tropical latitudes where many fair-skinned Caucasi-
ans take their holidays. For example, exposures of 20–60 
SED per day are possible in Brazil from 15–24°S, and 
30 SED is achievable from 10.00–14.00 in mid-summer 
in São Paulo (24°S) (27). Sixty SED daily is possible in 
Southern Europe and 40–50 SED in Northern Europe 
(8). Considerable epidermal DNA damage (TT CPD) 
was measured in European holidaymakers after a week 
in March in Tenerife (28.3°N – comparable latitude to 
the holiday destination of Florida) (28), during which a 
mean cumulative dose of 57 SED over the week (range 
21.0–115.0) was received by Danish holidaymakers (29), 
that was estimated to be 43% of their annual UVR burden. 
Furthermore, all the Danes had sunburn (7) despite the 
use of sunscreens. Thus, our experiments involved envi-

Sunscreen prevents epidermal DNA photodamage
Acta Derm Venereol 2018
ronmentally relevant exposures of 15 and 30 SED, and 
resulted in cumulative doses of 75 and 150 SED (~25 and 
~50 MED) in the repeated exposure group. 
The HPLC-MS/MS assay quantified overall epidermal 
TT CPD but the data also include some dermal lesions, 
the relative proportion of which will be very small (esti-
mated < 5%) because the dermis (which was trimmed) is 
mainly an acellular tissue. The HPLC-MS/MS data were 
supported by immunostaining assessments of the epider-
mal location of CPD. Comparable trends and statistical 
outcomes were observed for all assays (see Table II) in 
both study groups. DNA protection was dependent on 
sunscreen application thickness in all assays except for 
melanocytes, but a linear trend was indicated. An acute 
exposure of 30 SED, with sunscreen at 1.3 and 2.0 mg/
cm2, caused significantly less damage than 4 SED without 
sunscreen in all assays. However, there was no significant 
difference between DNA damage at 1.3 and 2.0 mg/
cm2 application thicknesses in any of the assays. This, 
coupled with the zero values, may explain why there are 
more CPD with 2 mg/cm2 than 1.3 mg/cm2 in the HPLC/
MS-MS assay (see Fig. 4a). Thirty SED plus sunscreen at 
0.75 mg/cm2 also resulted in fewer TT CPD than 4 SED 
without protection. This difference was not significant 
in any assay, but shows less damage with 7.5 times the 
SSR control dose. Fig. 3b shows CPD hotspots with the 
sunscreen at 0.75 mg/cm2. This is not surprising because 
sunscreen films on the skin are composed of many dif-
ferent thicknesses, as formulations tend to fill valleys 
and leave peaks that are only partially protected (30). 
The acute study also showed similar trends in the 
formation and protection of TT, TC and CT CPD (Table 
I). Cytosine containing CPD cause mutagenic C to T 
transitions in model systems (31) and skin tumours (32, 
33). There was also a comparable induction of 6-4PP and 
their Dewar valence isomers on the various treatment 
sites. The respective photoproduct yields in the acute 4 
SED positive controls agree with previous reports in skin 
exposed to UVB (280–315 nm) (21, 22) and SSR (34), 
which show fewer 6-4PP and their Dewar valence isomers 
than CPD, and that the Dewar TC derivatives are more 
frequent than the TT. Furthermore, we report here for the 
first time, the presence of Dewar isomers in human skin 
exposed in vivo to SSR. This confirms the major role of the 
solar UVA in the photoisomerization of 6-4PP (35–37). It 
should be noted that the relative frequencies of different 
types of DNA photoproducts in vitro depends on solar 
spectrum (latitude) (38). However, the UVB and UVA 
EEE of SSR and the Tenerife spectrum are very similar, 
but the spectrum that reaches the viable epidermis will be 
modified by a sunscreen’s optical properties. 
Acute studies do not represent holiday exposure. 
Epidermal CPD accumulation in DNA occurs with 
daily sub-erythemal SSR exposure (39) because of slow 
nucleotide excision repair (NER). This is illustrated by 
the persistence of TT CPD in human skin in vivo with 
a half-life of 33.3h (18). An acute control exposure of 
4 SED (~1.3 MED) gave a mean 
± SD of 30.1± 14.8 TT 
CPD/106 bases whereas 5 daily 1 SED (~0.3 MED) 
induced 16.8± 4.9 TT CPD/106 bases. The lower value 
(56%) with the higher cumulative dose is indicative of 
NER during the 5-day study. 
The repeated exposure studies showed that protection 
was significantly dependent on sunscreen application 
thicknesses for all assays except melanocytes. Daily high 
dose exposure with sunscreen at 1.3 mg/cm2 and 2.0 mg/
cm2 resulted in significantly less DNA damage than 1 
SED/day without protection in all assays. This was also 
the case for sunscreen at 0.75 mg/cm2 with the quantitative 
HPLC-MS/MS assay but not for the immunostaining end-
points. The lack of detectable lesions by immunostaining 
in some cases with the sunscreen at 1.3 and 2.0 mg/cm2 
is also indicative of a high level of protection. 
The SPF is a function of sunscreen application thick-
ness (9, 40), which we also show for DNA protection, 
for the first time, under acute and repeated SSR exposure 
conditions. A recent study of holidaymakers in Egypt (9) 
showed a mean sunscreen application thickness of 0.79 
mg/cm2 (labelled average SPF=15 with estimated real 
SPF=3), which is very similar to our value of 0.75 mg/
cm2. This typical “real life” application thickness in the 
acute exposure group showed no significant difference 
in TT CPD, in any assay, compared with unprotected 
skin (see Fig. 4). The SSR dose was 7.5 times higher 
in the acute study for protected skin (at 0.75 mg/cm2) 
compared with unprotected skin, which indicates a DNA 
protection factor (DNA-PF) of ≥ 7.5 (30/4 SED). A com-
parable analysis with the immunological data indicates

a DNA-PF of ≥ 15 (15/1 SED) in the repeated exposure 
group. However, the difference was significant with the 
HPLC-MS/MS assay with 40% TT CPD on sunscreen 
treated sites compared with 1 unprotected SED (see Fig. 
5a), giving a crude estimated DNA-PF of 37.5 (15/0.4). 
Overall, our data demonstrate considerable DNA pro-
tection by a sunscreen even under typical conditions 
of application, intense tropical holiday insolation and, 
importantly, repeated SSR exposure. 
“Dark” CPD have been recently described in a murine 
model and in vitro after UVA radiation. These lesions 
are formed post-irradiation, with a peak of 3–4 h after 
exposure (41, 42). Vitamin E (α-tocopherol) inhibited 
the formation of “dark” CPD in the in vitro studies. We 
have reported the presence of “dark” CPD in human skin 
in vivo after SSR exposure (Fajuyigbe et al, manuscript 
under preparation). The sunscreen contained a vitamin 
E based antioxidant (25). It is possible that some of its 
CPD protective effects were mediated via the inhibition 
of “dark” CPD. However, the taking of the biopsies 
immediately after exposure (or the last exposure in the 
repeated exposure group) was not designed to assess the 
effect of the sunscreen on “dark” CPD. 
A recent study has reported the effect of the same 
sunscreen at 2 mg/cm2 after individualised MED-based 
SSR exposures in skin type I/II volunteers (43). Ana-
lyses by HPLC-MS/MS were done on epidermal DNA 
samples derived from suction blisters. TT CPD (and CT 
and TC CPD) were detected after 2 MED (~4–6 SED 
(21)) in the same rank order and at comparable quantities 
with our 4 SED control data. However, no lesions were 
detected after 15 MED (~30–45 SED) in the presence 
of sunscreen. 15 MED though an SPF = 64 sunscreen is 
0.25 MED (0.5–0.75 SED). The blisters were taken at 
~4 h after exposure, which will also have allowed time 
for maximal “dark” CPD to be formed and very limited 
repair of “light” CPD (18).
The introduction reports that sunscreen use can signi-
ficantly inhibit melanoma, SCC but not BCC. However, 
the sunscreen protection against skin cancer offered by 
sunscreen is very modest; for example rate ratio of 0.62 
(95% CI 0.38–0.99) for SCC with long-term follow 
up (11) and hazard ratio of 0.50 (95% CI 0.24–1.02) 
for melanoma in the Australian study population (13); 
in effect the sunscreen offered “skin cancer protection 
factors” of ≤ 2 with a labelled SPF of 16 but in practice 
likely to have been considerably lower (44). It is well 
established that the incidence of all types of skin cancer 
is much lower in black skin compared to white (45). For 
example, the incidence of melanoma is ~30 times greater 
in white vs. black Americans (46). The DNA-PF that con-
stitutive melanin (on sun protected skin) affords against 
SSR-induced CPD has been determined by comparing 
black (type VI) and white (types I/II) skins (47). The 
DNA-PF was dependent on epidermal location, ranging 
from 5.0 (95% CI 4.5–5.5) in the upper epidermis to 59.0 
(95% CI 24–110) in the basal layer that has the greatest 
concentration of melanin. This suggests that high SPF 
sunscreens are necessary to have a major impact on skin 
cancers, especially those that originate in the basal layer. 
The study strengths are the assessment of the sunscreen 
under conditions that simulate intense real life holiday 
solar exposure and typical application thickness of 
sunscreens. The comparable outcomes with quantitative 
HPLC-MS/MS and semi-quantitative immunostaining 
add robustness to our conclusions. Protection is also 
shown in the basal layer that contains keratinocyte stem 
cells and melanocytes from which skin cancers can 
arise. The trends with the melanocytes were similar to 
the other endpoints but with higher p-values; almost 
certainly due to their relatively small number compared 
to the other endpoints. The weakness of the study is the 
relatively small numbers of participants, though, as shown 
in Table II, most of the comparisons show a high level of 
significance. Furthermore, this study was not designed to 
determine sunscreen DNA-PF, which is an important pa-
rameter for future research. Prevention of CPD provides 
a mechanistic basis for the ability of sunscreens to inhibit 
SCC, and possibly melanoma (48). Our data support the 
role of regular sunscreen use to reduce the risk of skin 
cancer and the application of very high SPF sunscreens, 
even if they are typically used at ~1/3 of the thickness 
required for SPF labelling.
