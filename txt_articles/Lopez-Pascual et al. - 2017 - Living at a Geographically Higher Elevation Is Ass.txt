Living in a geographically higher altitude affects oxygen availability. The possible
connection between environmental factors and the development of metabolic syndrome
(MetS) feature is not fully understood, being the available epidemiological evidence still
very limited. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the longitudinal association
between altitude and incidence of MetS and each of its components in a prospective
Spanish cohort, The Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra (SUN) project. Our study
included 6860 highly educated subjects (university graduates) free from any MetS
criteria at baseline. The altitude of residence was imputed with the postal code of each
individual subject residence according to the data of the Spanish National Cartographic
Institute and participants were categorized into tertiles. MetS was defined according to
the harmonized definition. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the
association between the altitude of residence and the risk of MetS during follow-up.
After a median follow-up period of 10 years, 462 incident cases of MetS were identified.
When adjusting for potential confounders, subjects in the highest category of altitude
(>456 m) exhibited a significantly lower risk of developing MetS compared to those
in the lowest tertile (<122 m) of altitude of residence [Model 2: Hazard ratio = 0.75
(95% Confidence interval: 0.58–0.97); p for trend = 0.029]. Living at geographically
higher altitude was associated with a lower risk of developing MetS in the SUN project.
Our findings suggest that geographical elevation may be an important factor linked to
metabolic diseases.

Altitude and Metabolic Syndrome
INTRODUCTION
The metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of interrelated
physiopathological comorbidities identified as a risk factor for
cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes (Wilson et al., 2005).
These factors include obesity (especially central adiposity),
hyperglycaemia, dyslipidaemia and hypertension (Grundy et al.,
2005). Therefore, this syndrome requires a multiple approach due
to its complex and uncertain causes (Grundy et al., 2005; Alberti
et al., 2009). The prevalence of MetS is increasing all over the
world, closely related to higher obesity and sedentary lifestyle
rates (Alberti et al., 2009). Thus the MetS is a public health
problem, which could be reduced by means of healthy lifestyle
policies and programmes (Lucini et al., 2016).
Despite the fact that some risk factors for developing MetS
are widely recognized (e.g., smoking, unhealthy dietary habits,
sedentary behavior) (Grundy et al., 2005), insufficient reports
about protective factors, such as healthier dietary patterns (Abete
et al., 2010), can be found. Concerning modifiable factors, the
environment has been suggested to potentially influence the
development of metabolic diseases (Friel et al., 2011; Dhurandhar
and Keith, 2014; Valdes et al., 2014). Moreover, some studies on
subjects living at high altitudes have reported lower incidence
rates of conditions linked to MetS such as obesity (Voss et al.,
2013; Woolcott et al., 2014; Diaz-Gutierrez et al., 2016), heart
disease (Ezzati et al., 2012; Faeh et al., 2016), hypertension
(Norboo et al., 2015) or type 2 diabetes (Woolcott et al.,
2014).
Previous trials have assessed the role of hypoxia on metabolic
and physiologic characteristics (Millet et al., 2016). For instance,
body weight was significantly lower in obese subjects exposed
to hypobaric hypoxia at geographical altitude (Lippl et al., 2010;
Vats et al., 2013). Furthermore, increased basal metabolic rate and
leptin levels together with decreased food intake and diastolic
blood pressure have been associated with the exposure to higher
altitudes (Westerterp-Plantenga et al., 1999; Lippl et al., 2010).
The previously mentioned clinical trials suggest that not only
normobaric hypoxic exposures, but also hypobaric hypoxia could
drive some beneficial effects commonly associated with living
at geographical altitude. Some studies have reported beneficial
effects of a short-term geographical altitude exposure in subjects
with MetS (Schobersberger et al., 2003; Greie et al., 2006;
Neumayr et al., 2014; Gutwenger et al., 2015). On the other hand,
some investigations have reported non-significant changes in
obesity or cardiovascular risk factors in obese individuals treated
with sham intermittent hypoxia during exercise (Gonzalez-
Muniesa et al., 2015b,c; Gatterer et al., 2015) or without exercise
(Querido et al., 2012). Likewise, the effects of exercise recovery
in hypobaric hypoxia were analyzed in previous studies, with no
statistically significant results (Gatterer et al., 2015). Few studies
have observed a reduction in body weight of obese subjects
treated with physical exercise under normobaric intermittent
hypoxia compared to sham hypoxia group (Netzer et al., 2008;
Kong et al., 2014). However, higher oxygen availability has been
related with beneficial effects in several clinical disorders with an
underlying inflammatory cause (Gonzalez-Muniesa et al., 2015a).
However, to our knowledge, no prospective study has analyzed
the association between living at different altitudes and the risk
of MetS in healthy participants. This analysis hypothesized that
living at a geographically higher elevation may protect against
metabolic syndrome. Hence, the aim of the present study was to
evaluate the longitudinal long-term association between altitude
of residence and incidence of MetS in a prospective cohort of
Spanish university graduates.
METHODS
Study Population
The
SUN
project
(Seguimiento
Universidad
de
Navarra,
University of Navarra Follow-up) is a prospective, dynamic,
multipurpose cohort study conducted in Spain. The objectives,
design and methods of the SUN cohort have been previously
described (Martinez-Gonzalez et al., 2002; Martinez-Gonzalez,
2006; Segui-Gomez et al., 2006). Briefly, using biennial mailed
questionnaires participants have been continually followed-up.
Participants’ recruitment started in December, 1999 and it is
permanently open. All subjects have obtained a university degree.
Up until March, 2012 to have enough time for a 2-year follow-up,
the SUN project recruited 21,291 participants. The subjects that
ceased to respond the questionnaires of the study (n = 1881) were
considered lost to follow-up leaving a total of 19,410 (retention
rate = 91%). Participants who had not a minimum follow-up
of 6 years were excluded from the study (n = 4205). To avoid
reverse causality bias, 3890 individuals who met at least one
MetS criterion at baseline were excluded. Pregnant women at
baseline and during the follow-up were excluded (n = 2652). In
addition, participants suffering from a chronic disease (diabetes,
cancer or cardiovascular disease) at baseline were also excluded
(n = 625). For the present study, a subsample of the cohort was
selected for the final analysis with a total of 6860 participants over
25 years old that had answered the postal code in the baseline
questionnaire (Figure 1). The study was conducted according
to the guidelines laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki and
it was approved by the Human Research Ethical Committee of
the University of Navarra. Voluntary completion of the first self-
administered questionnaire was considered to imply informed
consent.
Assessment of Habits and Lifestyles
The baseline questionnaire collected subjects’ clinical history,
daily habits, lifestyle, social characteristics, the time of residence
at the current city and self-reported anthropometric information.
Leisure-time physical activity was calculated through a baseline
17-item questionnaire. The reproducibility and validity of self-
reported physical activity was assessed in a subsample of the
cohort (Martinez-Gonzalez et al., 2005). Adherence to the
Mediterranean dietary pattern was determined through the score
(0–9 points) proposed by Trichopoulou et al. (2003).
Assessment of Altitude
The postal code of each participant’s residence and the
time they have been living in their city/village was recorded
using the baseline questionnaire. We imputed the altitude of
each postal code according to Spanish National Cartographic

harmonized
definition
(IDF-
AHA/NHLBI) (Alberti et al., 2009). According to it, the MetS
diagnosis requires the occurrence of at least three of the following
five criteria: central adiposity (according to the country-specific
definition waist circumference: ≥94 cm in males and ≥80
cm in females), hypertriglyceridemia (≥150 mg/dL or specific
medication), low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol
(HDL-c: <40 mg/dL for men and <50 mg/dL for women),
elevated blood pressure (BP: systolic ≥130 and/or diastolic ≥85
mmHg or antihypertensive drug treatment in a patient with
a history of hypertension), and impaired glucose metabolism
(fasting glucose ≥100 mg/dL or drug treatment of elevated
glucose).
For a comparison between different MetS diagnosis criteria
AHA/NHLBI, IDF and Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III)
MetS definitions were used (Alberti et al., 2009). These
requirements differ from those in the harmonized definition in
the following terms: AHA/NHLBI defines central adiposity when
waist circumference ≥102 cm in males and ≥99 cm in females
or when diagnosed of type 2 diabetes; IDF specifies the central
adiposity as mandatory criterion and at least two of the four
criteria (equal to harmonized definition items); ATP III defines
central adiposity as waist circumference ≥102 cm in males and
≥88 cm in females.
Self-reported information about each specific MetS criterion
was collected in the Q_6 and Q_8 questionnaires (6th and 8th
year follow-up respectively). Additionally, a measuring tape was
sent to each participant including an explanation of how to
measure their own waist.
Diagnosis of MetS itself, the same as each MetS criterion was
previously validated in a subsample of the cohort, finding an
agreement between self-reported MetS and MetS diagnosis of at
least 90% (Barrio-Lopez et al., 2011).
Statistical Analyses
Estimated tertiles according to their baseline altitude of residence
were used to classify the participants included in the study:
0–121 meters (m) as the reference level, 122–456 m and ≥457 m.
Baseline characteristics according to their altitude of residence
were described using relative frequencies, means and standard
deviations.
Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the
association between the tertiles of altitude level and the risk of
MetS during follow-up. Person-time of follow-up was calculated
for each participant, from the date of completion of the baseline
questionnaire until the date of completion of the last follow-
up questionnaire, or date of death, whichever occurred first.
For the cases of incident MetS, the person-time follow-up
was set as the date of the follow-up questionnaire where they
met the criteria for MetS diagnosis. The Cox model included
age as the underlying time scale for all analyses. All models
were stratified by years living in the city/village, categories of
participants according to their date of entry into the cohort and
categories of age (deciles). An initial model adjusted for gender
was calculated. Two multivariable-adjusted models were fitted
for potential baseline confounders. Model 1 was adjusted for
gender, BMI (Kg/m2), total energy intake (Kcal/d), adherence to
Mediterranean dietary pattern (0 to 9 score), physical activity
(METs-h/week), sedentary behavior (h/d), hours sitting (h/d),
smoking status (non-smoker, smoker, former smoker), snacking
between meals (yes/no) and following special diets (yes/no).
Model 2 was additionally adjusted for sleeping time (h/d) and
alcohol intake (g/d).
Tests for linear trends across increasing categories of
altitude were conducted by assigning the median altitude of

residence within each category and treating this variable as
continuous. The specific relationship between each of the 5
components of the MetS and the altitude levels was assessed.
As sensitivity analyses, the risk of developing MetS living
at geographically higher altitude was calculated excluding
participants with family history of chronic diseases such as
obesity, diabetes, stroke and high blood pressure. Hazard
Ratios (HR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were
calculated. The proportional-hazards assumption was tested
with the Schoenfeld residual method and time dependent
covariates.
All p-values presented are two-tailed; p < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant. Analyses were performed
using STATA/SE version 12.0 (StataCorp, College Station,
TX, USA).
RESULTS
The

characteristics
of
participants
according
to
their altitude of residence are shown in Table 1. Higher
altitudes
on
average
were
associated
with
younger
age,
greater proportion of women, lower BMI and less physical
activity. No significant differences were found in baseline
sedentary behavior, smoking status, alcohol consumption,
adherence to the Mediterranean dietary pattern, special diets
or sleeping time. Participants in the highest category of altitude
had higher energy intake and were more likely to snack
between-meals.
Participants were followed-up for a median time of 10 years.
During the follow-up period 462 (6.73%) incident cases of
MetS were observed (Table 2A). Subjects in the highest category
of altitude (>456 m) exhibited a significantly lower risk of
developing MetS during follow-up compared to those in the
lowest category (<122 m) of altitude of residence [Model 2: HR =
0.75 (95% CI: 0.58–0.97); p for trend = 0.029]. Participants who
lived between 123 and 456 m did not show significantly lower risk
of developing MetS compared to those in the tertile 1. Moreover
a linear trend was observed (p = 0.029 in Model 2). In addition
to this, a multivariable linear regression showed that for every
additional 100 meters of altitude the MetS incidence (each MetS
criteria considered qualitatively on yes or no with a maximum
of 5 points) is expected to decrease slightly, but significantly
(p-value = 0.003), in the 8-year follow up.
The null hypothesis that the relative hazard was constant
over time was confirmed, as a non-significant result was found
(p = 0.19). The time-dependent covariates were tested using this
method, which gave a non-significant result indicating a non-
zero slope, and confirming that the relative hazard is constant
over time.
The risk of developing each component of MetS according to
the altitude level is shown in Figure 2. The HR and 95% CI for the
criteria of MetS were non-statistically significant after adjusting
for potential confounders.
Four different definitions of MetS were used to study the
hypothesis. These results, illustrated in Table 2B, were all in
the same direction showing little variations among them. The
reduction in the risk of developing MetS corresponded in all cases

DISCUSSION
The current study showed that living at geographically higher
altitude was significantly associated with a decreased risk of
developing MetS in a Spanish population of relatively young
university graduates. Moreover this effect followed a linear trend.
The Cox model included age as the underlying time scale for
all analyses. All models were stratified by years living in the
city/village, categories of participants according to their date
of entry into the cohort and categories of age (deciles). A
model adjusted for gender, and two multivariable models were
calculated. The first model with common dietary and lifestyle
co-variables and the second model additionally adjusted for other
potential confounders.
The higher concentration of oxygen (O2) that can be found
in the earth corresponds to sea level (21%). At this altitude level
the O2 partial pressure (pO2) is around 160 mmHg. Every 300 m
reduces the pO2 1% (McElroy et al., 2000; West, 2002). Our
study suggests a potential preventive effect of living at moderately
geographical altitude where the participants are exposed to lower

pO2, pressure, humidity and temperature. In this sense, the
prevalence of obesity has been positively associated with ambient
temperature in two different observational studies (Valdes et al.,
2014; Yang et al., 2015). It is also possible that other factors such
as polymorphisms for high altitude adaptation were involved
in this effect (Bigham et al., 2013; Huerta-Sanchez et al., 2013;
Valverde et al., 2015). In our study the participants in the
higher altitude category were at a median of 591 m and were
exposed, for a median time of 20 years, to a standard barometric
pressure of 95 kPa, which is 94% of the oxygen available at the
sea level. This oxygen pressure translated to the body’s oxygen
supply taking 14 breaths per minute as the respiratory frequency
and a tidal volume of 0.65 liters means an arterial pO2 of 12
kPa, and an oxygen saturation in blood (SaO2) of 97%. By
contrast, the median altitude of those who were living in the
lowest altitude (43 m) had an atmospheric pO2 of 100 kPa (with
almost 100% of oxygen available at sea level). Using the same
previous conditions this atmospheric pO2 means an arterial pO2
of 13.2 kPa and a SaO2 of 98% (Cruickshank and Hirschauer,
2004).
This difference of 1.2 kPa is not large, and these calculations
have limitations due to the possible adaptive response over years
and generations, nonetheless arterial hypoxemia induced by
exercise is defined as a reduction in the arterial oxygen pressure
only higher than 1 kPa (Nielsen, 2003). This leads to various
physiological mechanisms following adaptation due to chronic
lower hypoxia. In addition, from a population perspective we
have to take into account the potential existence of Rose
prevention paradox where factors that make a small difference to
the population distribution may be more important than factors
that have a clinical impact on a small number of people (Rose
et al., 2008).
A significant reduction in the risk of developing MetS
associated with living at geographically higher altitudes was
found. However, this outcome was only statistically significant
for the MetS as a whole but not for each one of its components
separately. This lack of significance might be explained by the
low incidence of the criteria of MetS in this young cohort (1.3%
hypertriglyceridemia, 4.0% low HDL-c, 6.7% hypertension and
2.5% type 2 diabetes). Only central adiposity showed a relatively
high incidence in our cohort (27.2%).
The reduction in the risk of developing MetS living at
geographical high altitude followed a similar trend to the main
analysis in those subjects with no family history of chronic
diseases. These results suggest that the genetic background of
chronic disease does not interfere with the potential benefits of
living at geographical high altitude.
Our results are novel, but they are in line with other studies
that did not specifically assessed MetS. Regarding to living
at high altitudes, several observational studies have reported
lower incidence rates of metabolic diseases in different large
cohorts (Ezzati et al., 2012; Voss et al., 2013, 2014; Woolcott
et al., 2014; Faeh et al., 2016). Obesity was significantly higher
at lower altitude category (<500 m) in an US cross-sectional

study after controlling for urbanization, temperature, behavioral
and demographic factors (males and females had 5.1 and 3.9
times the odds of obesity, respectively, compared to participants
over 3000 m) (Voss et al., 2013). A study about the incidence
of overweight/obesity at geographical altitude performed in
the SUN cohort found a reduction in the risk of developing
overweight or obesity (Diaz-Gutierrez et al., 2016). Lately, a
quasi-experimental study carried out with military population
observed that individuals with frequent migration stationed
at high altitude had 41% lower HR of obesity after multiple
adjustment (Voss et al., 2014). Another trial, also performed
in a US population, observed a lower risk of developing both
obesity and type 2 diabetes (OR: 0.77 and 0.88 respectively) at
high altitudes (from 1500 to 3000 m) (Woolcott et al., 2014).
In addition, two studies found an inverse association between
altitude (more than 1500 m) and mortality from ischemic heart
disease, while a positive association was established between
altitude and mortality from chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (Ezzati et al., 2012). The mortality rate from coronary
heart disease was also reduced in men living above 1220 m
(Faeh et al., 2016). These outcomes are consistent with our
results, although they enrolled participants living at considerably
higher altitudes than those in our cohort (up to 3500 m vs.
< 2000 m in our study). Higher hypertension prevalence was
associated to highest altitudes (more than 2000 m) in highlanders
of India (Norboo et al., 2015), which is opposed to our
results concerning hypertension, possibly because their study was
carried out with very high altitudes. As previously discussed, to
date there are no longitudinal studies analyzing the association
between living at geographical high altitude and the incidence of
MetS.
Notwithstanding that metabolic syndrome definition is
controversial (Balarini and Braga, 2016), we have considered
the most widely accepted definitions of this concept to test our
hypothesis. Comparisons conducted with different definitions
of MetS showed similar results to the main analysis. However,
diagnosis criteria influenced the association of altitude living
and the risk of developing MetS, being AHA/NHLBI definition
the most modified. This finding could be explained due to
the central adiposity criterion, included in the AHA/NHLBI
criteria, as high waist circumference (≥102 cm in males and
≥88 cm in females) or diagnosed type 2 diabetes (under drug
treatment). AHA/NHLBI and ATP III share the cut-off point of
waist circumference, as they do with the reduction in the risk of
developing MetS (AHA/NHLBI 39% and ATP III 34% less odds).
On the contrary, the other definitions (IDF and harmonized
IDF-AHA/NHLBI) share the limit waist circumference (waist
circumference: ≥94 cm in males and ≥80 cm in females) and
their results were similar (Harmonized 25% and IDF 23% less
odds).
Some
limitations
should
be
noted.
Participants’
high
educational level increases the internal validity of the results, even
though it could make our study population less representative.
This feature might influence on their willing to participate
in epidemiologic cohorts as they usually are healthier than
the general population (Alonso et al., 2006). We should be
cautious to generalize the results to the general population. A
different sample may produce different results and therefore,
it could be interesting to test our hypothesis in a different
sample with participants other than graduates. However, several
potential confounding factors related to lifestyle were used for
adjustments. Another potential limitation is the way of collecting
data relative to altitude, as it was only measured at baseline
assuming that the participants remained at the same altitude
over the follow-up period. Moving to a different altitude might
be a limitation in our study, since some participants may have
changed their permanent residence. Moreover, the exposure
variable has a limiting factor in this study since in Spain there are
few people living over 1500 meters. Atmospheric characteristics
(temperature, humidity or pressure) and population density-
related features (pollution from urban areas, migrations or
food accessibility) were not available in our study, but they
could be involved in the effects of living at geographical
high altitudes. These data would help to clarify the role of
environmental factors in the development of chronic diseases;
nonetheless urban areas are more or less well distributed due to
the presence of big cities both in the lower and in the other two
tertiles of altitude. Finally, some clinical parameters could have
helped to avoid potential confounders as self-reporting could
lead to bias. Nevertheless, participants were not aware of the
objective of the study when they answered the questionnaires
of the project. Finally, although we have adjusted for potential
confounders, we cannot rule out the existence of residual
confounding.
Major advantages are its prospective design with at least
6 years of follow-up to avoid reverse causation bias, the
previously validated methods to assess the main variables
(Barrio-Lopez et al., 2011), the use of a large sample of
participants and their university education, which helped
them to provide a high quality of information in their
answers to the questionnaires and also adds homogeneity
to the cohort regarding socio-demographic factors. These
features of the SUN cohort may reduce the potential for
confounding.
CONCLUSIONS
In this study of a Spanish population composed of university
graduates, we found that to live at geographically higher altitude
was directly associated with a lower risk of developing MetS
after 6 and 8 years of follow-up. This association was only
significant when MetS was analyzed as a whole. However, this
is a preliminary result and future studies with longer follow-
up periods, larger sample size and higher altitudes are needed.
Additional research, even including the future (but remote)
possibility of conducting a randomized preventive intervention,
should clarify the mechanisms of this relationship, and assess
the pros and cons of geographical high altitude residency on
MetS prevention. Moreover, our results need further validation
in the general population. Up to date, this is apparently the
first large longitudinal study analyzing the association between
MetS and altitude. Our findings suggest that geographical
elevation may be an important factor linked to metabolic
diseases.
