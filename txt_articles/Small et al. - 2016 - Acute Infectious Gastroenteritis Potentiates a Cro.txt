Abstract
Crohn’s disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory condition of diverse etiology. Exposure to
foodborne pathogens causing acute gastroenteritis produces a long-term risk of CD well
into the post-infectious period but the mechanistic basis for this ongoing relationship to dis-
ease onset is unknown. We developed two novel models to study the comorbidity of acute
gastroenteritis caused by Salmonella Typhimurium or Citrobacter rodentium in mice colo-
nized with adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC), a bacterial pathobiont linked to CD.
Here, we show that disease activity in the post-infectious period after gastroenteritis is
driven by the tissue-associated expansion of the resident AIEC pathobiont, with an atten-
dant increase in immunopathology, barrier defects, and delays in mucosal restitution follow-
ing pathogen clearance. These features required AIEC resistance to host defense peptides
and a fulminant inflammatory response to the enteric pathogen. Our results suggest that
individuals colonized by AIEC at the time of acute infectious gastroenteritis may be at
greater risk for CD onset. Importantly, our data identify AIEC as a tractable disease modi-
fier, a finding that could be exploited in the development of therapeutic interventions follow-
ing infectious gastroenteritis in at-risk individuals.
Author Summary
Western societies have a disproportionately high rate of inflammatory bowel disease
(IBD), with growing incidence especially in the adolescent population. A large body of evi-
dence supports the view that bacteria in the gut participate in the pathophysiology of
human bowel diseases. The unifying concept is chronic inflammation that is driven by
microbial stimulation of the mucosal immune system. However, the mechanisms by
which pathogenic or commensal microbes work in concert with each other and with host
responses to perpetuate this inflammation is not well known. Adherent-invasive E. coli

 (AIEC) are Crohn’s disease (CD)-associated bacteria that are implicated in disease pathol-
ogy. AIEC are pro-inflammatory and may play a central role in maintaining chronic
inflammation in response to other CD risk factors, such as acute infectious gastroenteritis.
Here, we show that indeed, acute infectious gastroenteritis creates an inflammatory envi-
ronment in the gut that drives AIEC expansion and worsens disease severity. The increase
in disease severity strictly correlates with this AIEC bloom because blocking this bloom by
sensitizing AIEC to host defenses also improves the health status of the host. The long
time period between recovery from acute gastroenteritis and new onset CD may allow for
targeted interventions to mitigate the risk of CD in AIEC-positive individuals.
Introduction
Inflammation in Crohn’s disease (CD) can involve the small and large bowel and is accompa-
nied by changes in the microbial composition and distribution at these sites [1–3]. Clinical
observations have been consistent in finding increased numbers of bacteria associated with the
epithelial mucosa in Crohn’s patients, including members of the Enterobacteriaceae that are
enriched in virulence and secretion pathways as determined by culture and molecular methods
[4–6]. Although a detailed microbiologic analysis of this population has not been done and
their role in disease has not been described,these data imply that the environment favoring
bacterial expansion at the mucosal surface is inflammatory in nature and that this particular
bacterial bloom is of pathogenic significance in the disease.
Among bacteria linked to CD, adherent-invasive E. coli (AIEC) have emerged as having
likely pathogenic significance.Since its discovery in 1998 [7], several laboratories have reported
a higher prevalence of AIEC in CD patients compared to healthy subjects and confirmed their
pro-inflammatory potential [5, 8, 9]. Although AIEC share evolutionary ancestry with extrain-
testinal pathogenic E. coli [10], their infection biology suggests a pathobiont lifestyle that is dis-
tinct from frank enteric pathogens. A growing body of work indicates that different host
environments can select for AIEC. For example, AIEC isolated from adults [5, 10–12], children
[13, 14], and companion animals [15] exhibit a degree of genetic diversity that has made it dif-
ficult to discriminate this E. coli pathotype at a molecular level. AIEC can also be isolated from
seemingly healthy individuals (albeit much less frequently than in CD), implying that interac-
tions between AIEC and other microbes or host genes might be needed to elicit their patho-
genic character.
CD is more common in individuals exposed to acute infectious gastroenteritis caused by
Salmonella and other enteric pathogens, sometimes with onset times on the order of years after
the infectious episode [16–18]. The mechanistic basis for this long-term risk association follow-
ing an acute event lasting ~2 weeks is unresolved, however one possibility is that resident gut
microbes could perpetuate inflammatory reactions in the post-infectious period. This relates to
several clinical observations [19, 20]. First, acute infectious gastroenteritis increases the risk of
CD onset, often through an intermediate state of post-infectious-irritablebowel syndrome
(IBS) [16–18]; second, gastroenteritis causes inflammation that selectively disrupts the resident
intestinal microbiota in favor of some members of the Enterobacteriaceae [21, 22]; and third,
intestinal infections with frank enteric pathogens have been implicated as a probable cause of
relapse in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients [23, 24].
We developed two new models to study comorbidity following acute infectious gastroenteri-
tis in hosts colonized by an AIEC pathobiont from a Crohn’s disease patient. We show that

 enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium), or the attaching and effacing mouse patho-
gen Citrobacter rodentium, have a worsened outcome compared to AIEC-naïve animals
exposed to the same infection stimuli. Bacterial gastroenteritis induced an AIEC bloom in the
ileum and colon accompanied by an increase in disease severity. The increase in disease sever-
ity strictly correlated with this AIEC bloom because blocking AIEC expansion by sensitizing
the bacteria to host defenses ameliorated disease status, providing a direct correlation between
AIEC and host damage. These data are the first to show that acute gastroenteritis modulates
AIEC levels in the colonized gut, and establish AIEC as an active yet tractable disease modifier
in response to acute infectious gastroenteritis.
Results
AIEC modifies disease outcome following S. Typhimurium-induced
gastroenteritis
To study the link between acute infectious gastroenteritis and susceptibility to CD we developed
a co-infectionmodel that leveraged a model of chronic colonization of wild type mice with
AIEC strain NRG857c [25]. This isolate from a patient with Crohn’s disease colonizes both 129e
and C57BL/6 mouse strains, allowing for non-lethal secondaryinfections with S. Typhimurium
and C. rodentium, respectively. First, groups of 129e mice were colonized with AIEC for 14 days
or remained AIEC-naïve, and then exposed to S. Typhimurium to invoke acute infectious gas-
troenteritis (Fig 1A). Polymicrobial infection with AIEC and S. Typhimurium lead to signifi-
cantly worsened clinical outcome in 129e mice compared to mono-infected mice. All mice
infected with either AIEC or S. Typhimurium alone survived for the duration of the experiment
(35 days), whereas ~ 50% of the co-infectedmice died over a 6-week period after the secondary
Salmonella infection (Fig 1B). More severe disease was evident in the co-infected cohort, which
had diarrhoea, dehydration, hunched posture, and significant body weight loss at ~ day 5 after
infectious gastroenteritis was initiated (Fig 1C). Overall these results indicated that prior coloni-
zation by AIEC worsened the clinical outcome of infectious gastroenteritis.
Prior AIEC colonization worsens pathology following S. Typhimurium
infection
Infection of AIEC-colonizedmice with S. Typhimurium was accompanied by non-segmented
watery stool, a reduction in cecal and colon size and a hardened rubberytexture of the gut with
occasional ulcerations (Fig 2A). Histochemical analysis performed on H&E-stained cecal sec-
tions from S. Typhimurium infected mice showed only focal submucosal edema and mild to
moderate epithelial hyperplasia, whereas co-infected mice had dramatic epithelial destruction
along with extensive transmural inflammation, edema, and loss of crypt architecture (Fig 2B).
When quantified, the histopathology in co-infected mice was significantly greater than in mice
monocolonized with either AIEC or S. Typhimurium (Fig 2C).
Nitric oxide is a biomarker for active bowel inflammation and is directly correlated with dis-
ease activity in IBD patients [26]. We measured nitrite levels in the cecum from animals either
monocolonized with AIEC or S. Typhimurium, or co-infected with both. Cecal nitrite levels
were significantly higher in mice co-infected with AIEC and S. Typhimurium, consistent with
the immunopathology observedpreviously (Fig 2D). Ulceration and damage to the mucosal
epithelium in co-infected mice suggested permeability defects in the epithelial barrier. To test
this we gavaged mice with fluorescein isothicyanate (FITC)-dextran (FD4) and measured
translocation of FD4 from the gut lumen to the serum. These results showed a significant

 increase in serum FD4 in all infected mouse groups compared to uninfected control mice, with
the largest increase seen in S. Typhimurium-infected mice pre-colonized with AIEC (Fig 2E).
Acute infectious gastroenteritis causes expansion of the tissue-
associated AIEC population
The higher rates of mortality seen in S. Typhimurium-infected 129e mice harbouring resident
AIEC was reminiscent of mortality profiles in susceptible mouse lines such as C57BL/6 that do
not constrain S. Typhimurium and develop lethal levels of bacteremia. Therefore, we hypothe-
sized that prior AIEC colonization was driving a Salmonella-induced disease process, however
this was inconsistent with the S. Typhimurium colonization data. By measuring S. Typhimur-
ium loads in the feces over time we found that 129e controlled S. Typhimurium similarly in
both AIEC-colonized and AIEC-naïve animals, with colonization rates similar to that found in
other studies [27]. Indeed, Salmonella colonization levels decreased over time in line with the
ability of 129e mice to restrict the growth of S. Typhimurium [28] (Fig 3A). Consistent with
these data, the tissue-associated levels of S. Typhimurium in the cecum, ileum and spleen were
similar in monocolonized and co-infected animals (Fig 3B), indicating that AIEC did not alter
the ability of the host to control S. Typhimurium.
After AIEC colonization, 129e mice maintain stable AIEC levels [25]. In contrast to Salmo-
nella loads in our model, we found dramatic and reproducible increases in the levels of AIEC
following acute infectious gastroenteritis that was reflected only in the tissue-associated bacte-
rial population. This bacterial bloom was not evident in the bulk luminal population isolated
from the feces, however we found a 2-log and 3-log increase in tissue-associated AIEC levels in
the cecum and ileum, respectively (Fig 3C). Culture-independent methods have found that
ileal CD lesions are enriched in Enterobacteriacae containing pathobiont-associated properties
such as adhesion and invasion [5], a finding that has been confirmed in functional metage-
nomic studies [4]. To test whether this AIEC bloom was specific to this pathobiont or reflected
a more generalized permissive niche for E. coli, we repeated these experiments with mice colo-
nized with a rifampicin-resistant derivative of the human commensal E. coli K12. Despite
showing stable colonization levels before infectious gastroenteritis, Salmonella infection caused
a dramatic decrease in E. coli K12 levels in both the feces and tissue-associated samples (Fig
3D), which was in contrast to the bloom seen by AIEC. These results are consistent with the
susceptibility of commensal E. coli to Salmonella-induced inflammation, leading to E. coli kill-
ing in the inflamed gut [29]. Together these results support the hypothesis that acute infectious
gastroenteritis creates a specializedniche permissive for the AIEC pathobiont with enhanced
fitness under inflamed conditions, and are consistent with the selective increase in invasive tis-
sue-associated E. coli in CD biopsies [4, 5].
Prior AIEC colonization leads to heightened cellular and
proinflammatory cytokine responses in the cecum following S.
Typhimurium infection
CD is characterized by a heightened inflammatory state in the gut [30]. We next characterized
the inflammatory environment in the gut that selected for AIEC outgrowth five days after
infectious gastroenteritis was initiated. Immunohistochemical analysis showed a significant
increase in the number of infiltrated F4/80+, GR1+, and CD3+ cells in the cecum of AIEC-colo-
nized mice at day 5 after S. Typhimurium infection, compared to the monocolonized or unin-
fected control groups (Fig 4A and 4B). These immune cell populations were heavily
concentrated in the lamina propria compared to the singly infected groups as well as the PBS
control group. The lamina propria of CD lesions contains elevated levels of tumour necrosis

 proinflammatory cytokine involved in the secondary induction of chemokines and is the target
of biologic therapy used in CD [32]. Consistent with the TNF-α and cellular responses seen in
the cecum there was increased levels of released MIG, IP-10 and MIP-1β chemokines in AIEC
colonized mice exposed to S. Typhimurium (Fig 4E). Together these data indicated that prior
AIEC status of the host had a dramatic impact on disease outcome following acute infectious
gastroenteritis. Whereas AIEC-naïve hosts developed a self-limiting infectious gastroenteritis,
hosts with indwelling AIEC had heightened immunopathology, immune cell infiltration, and a
marked expansion of tissue-associated AIEC loads in the gut.
Resistance to host defense peptides is required for AIEC expansion in
the inflamed gut and immunopathology
We previously discovered a genomic island (PI-6) on an extrachromosomal plasmid in AIEC
strain NRG857c that confers resistance to human host defense peptides through the action of
antimicrobial peptide resistance locus, arlABC. ArlA is a Mig-14 family member protein impli-
cated in defensin resistance in Salmonella, ArlB is a predicted NAD-dependent epimerase, and
ArlC is an OmpT family outer membrane protease that cleaves cationic antimicrobial peptides
[33, 34]. In order to test whether the worsened disease outcome following infectious gastroen-
teritis was directly linked to expansion of AIEC in the gut, we colonized mice with an AIEC
ΔPI-6 mutant that is sensitive to killing by defensins, cathelicidins, and by the antimicrobial
activity of the monokine MIG/CXCL9 [34], and tested whether this peptide-sensitive mutant
could expand in the post-infectious period following gastroenteritis. Consistent with previous
experiments, wild type AIEC expanded 2–3 logs in the cecum and ileum following S. Typhi-
murium gastroenteritis and lead to ~50% host mortality. In contrast, the ΔPI-6 mutant showed
no expansion following infectious gastroenteritis in either the cecum or the ileum and none of
these co-infected mice succumbed to infection (Fig 5A and 5B), providing a direct link between
AIEC expansion and disease outcome. To confirm that fulminant gastroenteritis elicited by S.
Typhimurium was required for maximal AIEC expansion and for AIEC-dependent pathology,
we used an avirulent Salmonella mutant that invokes less host inflammation due to loss of the
type 3 secretion system-1 (T3SS-1) and T3SS-2 [29] (ΔinvA ΔssaR; labeled S.tmAvir). Co-infec-
tion with this Salmonella mutant blunted the AIEC expansion compared to that seen following
wild type Salmonella infection in both the cecum (Fig 5C) and ileum (Fig 5D). Histochemical
analysis of H&E-stained cecal sections showed that preventing AIEC expansion mitigated the
tissue pathology compared to mice in which wild type AIEC blooms were present (Fig 5E and
5F). In mice colonized with AIEC ΔPI-6, crypt architecture and goblet cells were largely intact
and there were fewer necrotic cells in the lumen. Also, when S.tmAvir was used for the second-
ary infection in AIEC-colonized mice there was a significant reduction in immunopathology
(Fig 5F), a blunted TNFα release from explanted cecal tissue (Fig 5G), and a significant reduc-
tion in fecal lipocalin-2 output (Fig 5H).
Infectious colitis prevents convalescence from AIEC colonization
In addition to Salmonella gastroenteritis being a risk factor for new onset CD [18], entero-
pathogenic E. coli (EPEC) has been associated with both first onset IBD [16, 17, 35] and relaps-
ing disease requiring surgical intervention [23, 24]. The Citrobacter rodentium murine model
of infectious colitis, resembling the disease course of EPEC in humans, is well established [36].
The disease course in C57BL/6 mice is acute and self-limiting, providing an opportunity to val-
idate our findings on AIEC potentiation in a secondaryco-infection model. To test this we col-
onized groups of C57BL/6 mice with AIEC, which, in contrast to 129e mice that are colonized
for the lifetime of the animal, are colonized transiently with AIEC over a 3–4 week timeframe

 immunity towards C. rodentium (Fig 6B). Similar to what we observedin previous studies,
C57BL/6 mice monocolonized with AIEC cleared the bacteria around day 25 (Fig 6C). In con-
trast, C. rodentium infection caused an outgrowth of AIEC, which was detectable in the feces
beginning ~ 4 days after C. rodentium infection and reaching significance by day 10 and there-
after until day 36 when the experiment was stopped (Fig 6C). Interestingly, this AIEC expan-
sion persisted into the post-infectiousperiod after C. rodentium was cleared, and lasted well
after monocolonized mice typically clear AIEC, indicating that infectious colitis prevents nor-
mal convalescence from AIEC colonization in this host background. C. rodentium infection
initiates in the cecum and progresses to the colon. These sites are the primary targets of host
inflammation whereas the small intestine is generally neither colonized nor inflamed by C.
rodentium [37]. We measured the tissue-associated AIEC loads at these sites and found a sig-
nificant AIEC bloom in the cecum at day 21, and in the colon at both day 14 and 21 after C.
rodentium infection (Fig 6D and 6E).
Mucosal epithelial restitution is delayed by AIEC following infectious
colitis
C. rodentium levels in the colon peak 10 days after infection, followed by the onset of peak
inflammation at day 14 when pathology is maximal. Histological analyses of H&E-stained
colonic sections showed that by day 14, C. rodentium had induced colon pathology in both
AIEC-colonizedand AIEC-naïve hosts (Fig 7A). This early pathology was primarily driven by
C. rodentium because the degree of pathology was similar in both infection groups (Fig 7B). By
day 21, the pathogenic features in C. rodentium monocolonized mice were largely normalized,
however significant pathological features persisted on day 21 in AIEC-colonized mice exposed
to C. rodentium despite the fact that C. rodentium had been cleared by this time point. The sur-
face epithelium and mucosa were the main sites of persistent host damage, and to a lesser
extent the sub-mucosa (Fig 7C), indicating that AIEC potentiated tissue damage in the post-
infectious period.
C. rodentium induces transient crypt hyperplasia and goblet cell depletion in the colon that
begins to normalize following the peak inflammatory period as the pathogen is cleared by ~
day 21 [36, 38]. On day 14, both infection groups exposed to C. rodentium had significant
crypt hyperplasia (Fig 7D) and goblet cell depletion (Fig 7E) compared to mice singly colonized
with AIEC. However on day 21, a time point at which C. rodentium had been cleared and the
crypt length and goblet cell phenotype had normalized in mice singly infected with C. roden-
tium (Fig 7D and 7E), mice harbouring AIEC prior to infectious colitis had a significant defect
in mucosal reconstitution, displaying persistent crypt hyperplasia and a sustained defect in
goblet cell numbers (Fig 7D and 7E). Given the high AIEC expansion in the colon at this time
point, these findings indicated that AIEC drives intestinal pathology and delayed mucosal epi-
thelial restitution in the post-infectiousperiod following infectious colitis.
Discussion
Despite decades of research, a unifying etiologic pathway to CD has been elusive. Genome-
wide association studies have now revealed close to 200 IBD susceptibility alleles. However, in
aggregate these loci account for only ~30% of CD heritability with a dominant contribution of
three common NOD2 variants [39]. The discordance rate of CD among monozygotic twins
also highlights the importance of environmental factors in disease pathogenesis [30]. Thus,
while genetic susceptibility remains a key consideration for risk assessment it must be consid-
ered among a constellation of other additive risk factors. Recent attention has turned towards a
‘multi-hit’ model of CD pathogenesis that reflects this conceptual framework [19]. In this

 model the cumulative effects of several factors presents a ‘tipping point’ between homeostasis
and protracted intestinal inflammation, a concept that was recently validated in a mouse model
involving a genetic TLR1 deficiency[40]. Another risk factor in this multi-hit framework is
acute infectious gastroenteritis caused by exposure to relatively common zoonotic pathogens
[16–18]. Although such infections tend to be self-limiting, these episodes confer long-term risk
of CD well into the post-infectiousperiod, suggesting a sustained imbalance of intestinal
homeostasis. Given that healthy subjects can carry AIEC as part of the microbial composition in
their gut [41], one possibility is that infectious gastroenteritis elicits the pathogenic character of
quiescent AIEC that subsequently exacerbates host damage. Indeed, our report suggests that
Crohn’s-associated AIEC exploit the unique host environment imprinted by the action of path-
ogenic microbes that have been linked to short- and long-term risk of IBD.
AIEC expansion and host damage following S. Typhimurium gastroenteritis required the
resistance of AIEC to host defense peptides. One of the first CD susceptibility genes was
NOD2/CARD15,in which loss-of-function mutations increase the risk of disease [42, 43]. Early
studies reported that loss of NOD2 signaling produced defects in the manufacture of some
human defensins by Paneth cells and offered a mechanism to account for the altered microbial
composition in CD. However these data have been challenged based on human [44, 45] and
better-controlled mouse studies [46] that show antimicrobial peptide production by Paneth
cells appears to be independent of NOD2 status. This is more in keeping with observations that
many antimicrobial peptides are instead increased in inflamed Crohn’s lesions [47, 48]. It also
implies that bacteria living at the mucosal surface with an active role in Crohn’s pathogenesis
would require mechanisms to resist antimicrobial peptides in the inflamed gut, at least in some
patients. Indeed, we found that when AIEC were rendered susceptible to host defense peptides
they could no longer expand following infectious gastroenteritis and produced moderating
effects on disease severity. Previous work found that, among AIEC isolates from IBD patients
that were phenotypically resistant to antimicrobial peptides (MIC >8 μg/ml), many of these
strains contained at least one resistance gene from the arlABC locus [34]. Interestingly, none of
the E. coli isolated from healthy subjects were resistant to host defense peptides, suggesting that
the host might imprint a selective pressure for the evolution of such traits. Whether this selec-
tive host environment arises as a result of genetics, the endogenous microbiota, or even xenobi-
otics used in the management of CD remains an open question. The fact that AIEC are
genetically diverse [12] suggests that a number of different founder populations are capable of
giving rise to this pathobiont type and understanding what shapes this evolutionary trajectory
will be an important topic for future studies.
The effect of infectious gastroenteritis on eliciting the pathobiont characteristics of AIEC is
consistent with other inflammation models using either chemical colitis or host genetic defi-
ciencies. For example, mouse colon injured by the sodium salt of dextran sulfate produces pan-
colitis that is further aggravated by AIEC strain LF82 [49, 50]. A genetic deficiencymodel
using TLR5-/- mice that can develop spontaneous colitis showed that transient colonization by
AIEC strain LF82 promoted the development of a colitic microbiota that persisted after AIEC
was cleared by the host [51, 52]. At this time, we cannot rule out wholesale changes in the
microbiota of our co-infection model in favor of a more proinflammatory composition, how-
ever our data suggests this is not the main driver. The expansion of tissue-associated AIEC and
its direct correlation with pathological outcomes in our study is consistent with human studies
showing that the severity of ileal CD is directly correlated with the tissue-associated E. coli bur-
den [3–5]. Thus, if global changes in the microbiota are present, it does not alter the disease
course in the absence of AIEC expansion.
In summary, exposure to pathogens that trigger acute gastroenteritis creates an environ-
ment favorable to colonization by AIEC in otherwiseuncontrived hosts. AIEC can be detected

 in a proportion of healthy individuals, which bears relevance to the finding that infectious gas-
troenteritis in the general population is a risk factor for IBD. This work provides rationale for
the development of novel diagnostic methods that could help identify AIEC-colonized individ-
uals who may be at greater risk following an episode of acute gastroenteritis. It is also possible
that infectious gastroenteritis in humans renders them more susceptible to de novo acquisition
of AIEC through vulnerabilities created by the disruption of the resident microbiota, a loss of
so-called colonization resistance. If so, efforts to understand the provenance of AIEC and its
transmission mechanisms should be intensified. Finally, the often long prodromal period for
CD [53] and the observedlatency between recovery from acute gastroenteritis and CD onset
may create intervention opportunities to mitigate or neutralize disease risk in a subset of
individuals.
Methods
Ethics statement
Animal experiments were conducted according to guidelines set by the Canadian Council on
Animal Care using protocols approved by the Animal Review Ethics Board at McMaster Uni-
versity under Animal Use Protocol #13-07-20.
Bacterial strains
AIEC strain NRG857c (serotype O83:H1) was isolated from an ileal tissue biopsy from a CD
patient in Charite Hospital (Berlin, Germany) and its genome sequence was determined previ-
ously [10, 54]. A mutant that is sensitized to the action of host defense peptides by deletion of
the genes arlABC (NRG857c ΔPI6) was characterized previously [34]. NRG857c and ΔPI-6
were cultured in Luria-Bertani(LB) broth containing chloramphenicol (34 μg/mL) and ampi-
cillin (100 μg/mL). Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strain SL1344 was cultured in LB
broth containing 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Escherichia coli K-12 strain MG1655 was cultured in
LB broth with 50 μg/ml rifampicin. Citrobacter rodentium strain DBS100 was cultured in LB
broth with no antibiotics. For mouse infections, AIEC was grown for 16–18 h at 37°C with
shaking, washed, diluted, and resuspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Prior to infec-
tion experiments S. Typhimurium was resuspended in HEPES buffer (pH 8.0), 0.9% NaCl.
Animal infections
Eight- to ten-week-old female 129e and C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Charles River Lab-
oratories. Animals were housed in a specific pathogen-free barrier unit under Level 2 condi-
tions at the Central Animal Facility at McMaster University. 129e mice were given 20 mg of
streptomycin by orogastric gavage 24 h before infection with 2 x 109 colony forming units (cfu)
of AIEC NRG857c. Control groups remained AIEC naïve by gavage with sterile PBS. Two
weeks later, AIEC-colonized and control mice were infected with 0.8 x 108 cfu of S. Typhimur-
ium. In the C. rodentium model, C57BL/6 mice were challenged with 2 x 108 cfu of C. roden-
tium at 1-week post-AIEC infection. Control groups received an equal volume of sterile PBS.
Bacterial enumeration in tissues
AIEC and the secondary acute pathogen were measured in fecal output. At various time points
after secondaryinfections, tissue-associated bacteria were enumerated in the cecum, colon and
ileum. Tissues were harvested into cold PBS at necropsy and flushed with PBS. Samples were
homogenized (Retsch), serially diluted in PBS, and plated on LB agar containing either chlor-
amphenicol and ampicillin to select for AIEC NRG857c; rifampicin to select for K-12; Brilliant

 green (BG) agar with no antibiotics to select for C. rodentium; or BG containing streptomycin
to select S. Typhimurium. After 24 h of incubation at 37°C, colonies were counted and
expressed as cfu per gram of tissue.
Histopathological evaluation and immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis
At various time points after secondaryinfection, sections of the cecal tip, distal colon or ileum
were collected and fixed in buffered 10% formalin for 72 h, paraffin-embedded,sectioned into
5-μm slices and then stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) by Histology Services
(McMaster University, Hamilton, ON). In some experiments tissues were flash frozen in opti-
mal cutting template compound (OCT; Sakura, Fisher) for immunohistochemical analysis. A
minimum of 5 views per section were analyzed for each sample and scored according to previ-
ously defined criteria summarized in S1 Table [25]. Crypt length measurements and goblet cell
quantification was done using ImageJ software on a Leica HC microscope with at least five
well-oriented crypts measured per field. Immunohistochemical staining of formalin- and
OCT- fixed tissue sections were performed using antibodies against F4/80 (1:600), CD3
(1:1000) and GR1 (1:500) at the Histology Services.Quantification was done on six to eight
views per section with at least six formalin-fixed sections per group.
Cytokine quantification
Tissues removed at necropsy on day 5 following infection with the secondary pathogen were
washed with cRPMI (10% fetal bovine serum, 1% L-glutamine and 50 μg/mL gentamicin), cut
into pieces, placed in 1 mL of cRPMI and incubated overnight at 37°C, 5% CO2. Supernatants
were removed after incubation and levels of cytokines and chemokines were determined using
the Mouse 32-Plex Discovery Assay by Eve Technologies (Calgary, AB) or Quantikine murine
ELISA kits from R&D systems (Minneapolis, MN).
Intestinal permeability assay
To measure intestinal permeability, mice were gavaged with 150 μl of 80 mg/ml FITC dextran
(4kDa) in PBS 4 h prior to sacrifice. Blood was collected by cardiac puncture or tail bleed into
15% v/v acid-citrate- dextrose. Plasma was collected by centrifugation and fluorescence was
measured at 530 nm with excitation at 485 nm.
Nitrite determination
Nitrite concentration in cecal supernatants was determined in a 96-well microplate by adding
50 μl of supernatants to 50 μl of Greiss reagent (Sigma-Aldrich) following incubation for at
least 10 min in the dark as describedin the manufacturer’s protocol. The absorbance (A550)
was measured and the concentration was determined from a standard curve.
Lipocalin determination
Fecal pellets were collected, weighed, homogenized in PBS using a Mixer Mill and then centri-
fuged at 13,000 rpm for 5 min. Following centrifugation, supernatants were removed and levels
of lipocalin were determined using a Quantikine murine ELISA kit from R&D systems (Minne-
apolis, MN).
Statistical analysis
Mann-Whitney or one-way ANOVA with Tukey or Dunnett post-test was performed using a
95% confidence interval to determine difference among infection groups. Kaplan-Meier

 survival curves were analyzed with the log rank test. All analyses were performed using Graph
Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software Inc. San Diego, CA). A P value of 0.05 or less was considered
significant.
