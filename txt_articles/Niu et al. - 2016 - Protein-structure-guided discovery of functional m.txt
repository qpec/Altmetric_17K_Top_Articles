Abstract
Local concentrations of mutations are well-known in human cancers. However, their 3-
dimensional (3D) spatial relationships have yet to be systematically explored. We developed a 
computational tool, HotSpot3D, to identify such spatial hotspots (clusters) and to interpret the 
potential function of variants within them. We applied HotSpot3D to >4,400 TCGA tumors across 
19 cancer types, discovering >6,000 intra- and inter-molecular clusters, some of which showed

 tumor/tissue specificity. In addition, we identified 369 rare mutations from genes including TP53, 
PTEN, VHL, EGFR, and FBXW7 and 99 medium recurrence mutations from genes such as 
RUNX1, MTOR, CA3, PI3, and PTPN11, all residing within clusters having potential functional 
implications. As a proof of concept, we validated our predictions in EGFR using high throughput 
phosphorylation data and cell-line based experimental evaluation. Finally, drug-mutation cluster/
network analysis predicted over 800 promising candidates of druggable mutations, raising new 
possibilities for designing personalized treatments for patients carrying specific mutations.
Introduction
With tens of thousands of tumor-normal pairs already sequenced, accumulation of cancer 
genomic data continues to accelerate. The vast majority of mutations are incidental with no 
discernable role in tumor development. Various computational approaches1–6 have been 
developed to winnow mutation lists down to the drivers, including searching for genes or 
pathways having mutation rates higher than that explained by chance, genes having either 
mutually exclusive or co-occurring mutations, or those having neighboring mutations on the 
linear DNA/protein sequences.
Mutational impact on protein structure has not yet been systematically analyzed, but recent 
developments are moving in this direction. For example, MuPIT7, an extension of LS-
SNP/PDB8, maps sequence variants onto protein structures, Interactome3D9 annotates 
protein-protein interactions with structural details, other web tools10–12 map and visualize 
variants on protein structures, SpacePAC13 identifies mutation clusters via simulation, 
CLUMPS14 clusters cancer genes and examines protein-protein interactions where at least 
one protein is known to be cancer related, and Mechismo identifies interaction sites 
contributing to the binding forces between proteins and other peptides15. However, no 
system yet provides comprehensive analysis for understanding mutational consequences or 
implications for drug delivery.
Here we present a novel computational tool, HotSpot3D, which identifies mutation-mutation 
and mutation-drug clusters using three-dimensional structures and correlates these clusters 
with known or potentially interacting functional variants, domains, and proteins. We 
describe its testing and subsequent application to more than 4,000 TCGA tumors across 19 
cancer types. Over 6,000 interacting cluster discoveries are identified, many of which are 
likely undetectable by conventional approaches, with a subset supported by high throughput 
phosphorylation data and cell-line based experimental evaluation included in this study as 
well as accumulated experimental evidence16–18. We also report 800 promising candidate, 
druggable mutations, generally characterized by complex, multi-dimensional interactions 
between drugs and mutations. The list furnishes substantial possibilities for future 
therapeutics.

Intra- and inter-mutation clusters across 19 cancer types
HotSpot3D is a multifaceted tool that integrates sequence mutations with three dimensional 
protein structures (Methods and Supplementary Note). It identifies significant spatial 
mutation and mutation-drug clusters in the form of novel or rare mutations co-clustering 
with known hotspot residues, medium recurrent mutations that collectively exhibit 
enrichment, cancer type-specific mutation clusters within and between proteins, and 
mutations potentially interacting with cancer drugs. HotSpot3D utilizes structures from the 
Protein Data Bank (PDB)19 and mutation/drug co-structures from DrugPort (Methods and 
Figure 1a). We evaluated HotSpot3D clustering performance and compared it to existing 
tools to demonstrate its advancement for mutation cluster analysis (Figure 1a–d and 
Supplementary Note).
We applied HotSpot3D to somatic non-truncational mutations (549,295 unique missense 
mutations and 4,201 in frame indels) in 4,405 samples from 19 major cancer types 
(Methods). To identify potential intra-molecular (within a single protein), inter-molecular 
(between proteins in a complex), and drug-mutation interactions (e.g. near drug binding 
pocket), we focused on detecting pairs within the typical protein interaction range of 10Å20. 
We applied Hotspot3D to specifically target intra-molecular mutation pairs separated by at 
least 20 amino acids (Methods). Clustering was performed on pairs within significant 
proximity (P < 0.05) and ultimately compared to a known cancer gene list of 624 genes 
(Supplementary Table 1).
Among the 5,822 intra-molecular clusters identified, 698 clusters are from 244 known 
cancer genes and 5,124 clusters are from 2,275 non-cancer genes (Supplementary Table 2 
and 3). 38 clusters (35 “cancer genes” and 3 “non-cancer genes”) were above the cluster 
closeness (Cc) threshold (Cc > 10.3, see Methods). The top 5 cancer genes exhibiting high 
cluster closeness are TP53, KRAS, BRAF, IDH1, and PIK3CA, as expected and due largely 
to their high mutation rates in cancer (Figure 2a). TP53 has the highest cluster closeness, a 
result of both numerous mutations in close proximity (192 unique mutations) and mutation 
recurrence (38 hotspot residues) throughout the gene. We observed a shift towards higher 
cluster closeness for mutation clusters in cancer genes as compared to non-cancer genes (P ≈ 
5.3e-13) (Figure 2a inset) (Methods).
Clustering analysis of protein complexes resulted in 488 clusters, of which 34 were 
comprised only of cancer genes, 122 contained at least one cancer gene, and 332 contained 
no cancer genes (Supplementary Table 2 and 4). Similar to the intra-molecular analysis, we 
selected top inter-molecular clusters (Cc > 4.1, see Methods) for downstream analyses 
(Figure 2b). Of the 22 clusters that passed the threshold, clusters containing cancer genes 
exhibit significantly higher cluster closeness than those having no cancer genes (Figure 2b 
inset).
Oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) have distinct mutation signatures, the former 
characterized by recurrent mutations at activating sites and the latter having higher 
abundances of truncations scattered across their sequences21. However, the mutational

 patterns of non-truncational mutations in TSGs have not been intensively studied. Using 64 
oncogenes and 74 TSGs classified by Vogelstein et al.21, we observed 124 and 89 intra-
molecular clusters in 36 oncogenes and 38 TSGs, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 1 and 
Supplementary Tables 5 and 6). Nine oncogenes (HRAS, KRAS, IDH1, IDH2, BRAF, 
PPP2R1A, SPOP, PIK3CA, and MAP2K1) and five TSGs (TP53, CDKN2A, B2M, 
FBXW7, and MAP2K4) account for >50% of non-truncational mutations included in 
clusters; Difference between oncogene/TSG in the number of genes with a majority of 
mutations in clusters is not significant (P ≈ 0.4). Clusters in both categories tend to correlate 
with known functional domains, suggesting functional implications (Supplementary Tables 7 
and 8).
Significant mutation clusters with cancer type specificity
To explore cancer type specificities within significant clusters, we performed unsupervised 
clustering of cancers with the 38 intra-molecular clusters (Cc > 10.3) and 22 inter-molecular 
clusters (Cc > 4.1) (Methods and Figure 3a,c). Non-specific intra-molecular clusters 
included those from TP53, PIK3R1, and KRAS (Figure 3a). We further identified 18 intra-
molecular clusters that were at least 50% specific to one cancer type (Supplementary Table 
9), suggesting diverse roles in different cell types. High specificity is associated with VHL 
and MTOR (Supplementary Fig. 2a), having 95% and 86% of their respective mutation 
clusters specific to KIRC, and DNMT3A with 91% specificity to AML. High-specificity 
clusters can be the result of a hotspot site having most of its mutations in one cancer type, as 
is the case with DNMT3A residue Arg882. Conversely, VHL and MTOR show distribution 
across multiple residues.
PIK3CA has 6 top-scoring, distinct clusters, exhibiting both UCEC and BRCA specificity 
(Figure 3b and Supplementary Fig. 2b). The PIK3CA(4) cluster at centroid Arg88 is 
primarily UCEC specific (54% of its mutations) and is distributed among three different 
residues (Arg38, Glu39, and Arg88) that show little BRCA specificity. Conversely, the 
PIK3CA(1) cluster is primarily BRCA specific (69% of its mutations), and the His1047 
centroid is primarily responsible for the overall BRCA specificity. Finally, the PIK3CA(5) 
cluster with centroid Cys420 shows distribution across multiple cancer types. We found mild 
GBM specificity in PIK3CA across 4 residues (Arg38, Glu39, Arg88, and Cys90) in the 
PIK3CA(4) cluster and CESC specificity at Glu726 in the PIK3CA(6) cluster. EGFR also 
has two different clusters that contribute to different cancer types (Figure 3b): an 
extracellular cluster, EGFR(1), with centroid at Ala289 enriched in LGG/GBM and the 
kinase domain cluster, EGFR(2), with centroid at Leu858 enriched in LUSC/LUAD.
Several inter-molecular clusters also showed tumor specificity, with 8 clusters >50% specific 
to one cancer type, including well-known oncogenic protein complexes ASB9/SOCS4/
TCEB1/VHL (KIRC), BTRC/CTNNB1 (UCEC), AKAP13/ARHGEF12/RHOA (HNSC), 
PPP2R1A/PPP2R2A (UCEC), and CBFB/RUNX1 (BRCA) (Figure 3c and Supplementary 
Table 10). KEAP1/NFE2L2 showed mutual exclusivity, with KEAP1 mutations in 
adenocarcinomas LUAD and STAD and NFE2L2 mutations in multiple other cancer types 
(Figure 3d). Two of the residues, Arg415 and Arg483 from KEAP1, have been 
experimentally validated and shown both to be in the KEAP1 binding pocket and to play a

 major role in the stability of the KEAP1/NFE2L2 complex22. We also identified 4 TCEB1 
residues, Arg82, Ser67, Ser86, and Tyr79 in UCEC, BRCA, UCEC, and KIRC, respectively, 
clustering with 7 VHL residues, Cys162, Leu153, Leu158, Leu169, Ser168, Gly114, and 
Val165 in KIRC; Tyr79 has been experimentally validated to disrupt the TCEB1/VHL 
complex16 (Figure 3d and Supplementary Table 11).
Rare and medium recurrence functional mutation discovery
Rare and medium recurrent drivers are often missed by frequency-based approaches1, 2. We 
define hotspot residues as those mutated in at least 5 different patient samples, regardless of 
the amino acid change. Mutations that fall in the same cluster as the hotspot residues are 
considered potential novel functional mutations.
We found 100 hotspot residues and 249 potentially novel functional mutations 
(Supplementary Table 12 and Figure 4a) clustered with hotspot residues from intra-
molecular analysis. TP53, PTEN, VHL, EGFR, and FBXW7 contain the top 5 clusters 
contributing the most novel functional mutations. A KRAS cluster had the second highest 
cluster closeness across all clusters, which is a consequence of the high frequency of 
mutations at the centroid and nearby hotspots. The centroid is at Gly12 (found in 198 patient 
samples) and has multiple amino acid changes (Gly12Cys/Asp/Ser/Val/Ala/Phe). For this 
particular cluster, we have 3 hotspot residues Gly12, Gly13, and Gln61 (Figure 5a). 
Additional possible functional mutations outside of hotspot residues are Ile36M, 
Ala59Glu/Gly/Thr (each in one sample), and Glu62Lys. Importantly, mutations 
Ala59Glu/Gly/Thr have a geodesic length of only 3Å from the highly mutated centroid 
Gly12 in 3D space, even though they are 47 amino acids away in the linear sequence. Ala59 
has a higher closeness centrality than expected due to its close proximity to highly mutated 
residues (Gln61, Gly12, and Gly13). Likewise, Ile36Met is more than 20 amino acids away 
from all other hotspot residues in the cluster, but has a geodesic distance of only 5.8Å from 
Gly12. These 5 potential novel functional mutations could be good candidates for 
subsequent functional validation. Another interesting observation is a MAP2K1 cluster with 
centroid at Pro124, which is recurrently mutated in 7 patient samples. Additionally, it 
contained another hotspot at Glu203, mutated 5 times (Figure 5b). Other potential functional 
candidates in this cluster are Arg47Gln (mutated only once, but having geodesic length of 
5.9 Å from the centroid) and Asn122Asp and Glu333Ala (likewise mutated once, but 
geodesics within 10 Å of centroid). Experimental evidence exists for our prediction that rare 
mutation Arg47Gln is functional in cancer (Supplementary Table 11). Arg47Gln led to 
increased phosphorylation of downstream kinases ERK1/2, supporting the activating 
potential of the mutation17.
Similarly, we can uncover potentially novel, functional variants from inter-molecular 
clusters. We found 33 hotspot residues and 120 potentially novel functional variants, 4 of 
which were already observed in intra-molecular clusters (Supplementary Table 13 and 
Figure 4b). Notable examples are the SMAD2, SMAD3, and SMAD4 complexes. Two 
separate inter-molecular clusters (Figure 5c) account for 28.6% of the SMAD2/SMAD3/
SMAD4 missense mutations and in-frame indels. For one of the complexes (purple cluster, 
Figure 5c), we were able to identify 7 rare variants, each mutated only once from SMAD2

 (Leu442Val, Leu446Val, Ser276Leu), SMAD3 (Gln405Leu), and SMAD4 (Asp355Gly, 
Pro356Leu, Ser357Pro) and all in close spatial proximity with the SMAD4 Arg361 hotspot 
(Arg361Cys/His/Pro/Ser). In addition, Asp450Asn in SMAD2 is mutated only once and is 
the closest spatially (2.6Å) to the SMAD4 hotspot residue, making it another functional 
candidate. Recent work confirms our prediction that mutations (Asp450 and Ser276 from 
SMAD2) in close proximity to the Arg361 hotspot on SMAD4 destabilize the SMAD2/4 
and SMAD3/4 complexes18 (Supplementary Table 11).
Our analysis also identified five such intra-molecular cases above the cluster closeness 
threshold involving RUNX1, MTOR, CA3, PI3, and PTPN11. None have hotspot residues, 
but all contain mutations having medium recurrence or rare variants that are spatially dense. 
All of the mutations in each of the five clusters collectively contribute to the high cluster 
closeness and could all be novel functional mutations (Supplementary Table 14). For 
example, the cluster in RUNX1 contains Arg162 recurrently mutated 4 times, Pro113 
mutated twice, and four other singleton mutations (Leu161Pro, Val118Ala, Asp160Gly, and 
Ala134Pro). In terms of inter-molecular cases, there are 9 clusters with significant cluster 
closeness, but no hotspot residues (Supplementary Table 15). The other SMAD2/3/4 cluster 
(orange cluster, Figure 5c) contains Asp537 (SMAD4) mutated 4 times, Arg268 (SMAD3) 
mutated 3 times, Pro305 (SMAD2) mutated twice, and four singletons (Arg531 and Leu533 
from SMAD4, Asp304 and Asp300 from SMAD2). Additionally, RBX1, CUL1 and GLMN 
form a cluster, but none are on the cancer gene list. This cluster contains Arg506, Gly543, 
and Glu758 from CUL1 and Met50 from RBX1, which are all mutated twice, and 6 
remaining mutations that are singletons (Supplementary Table 16).
Validation by protein array and functional experiment
In cancer, mutations within extracellular and kinase domains of Receptor Tyrosine Kinases 
(RTKs) can cause ligand-independent activation, leading to autophosphorylation. We keyed 
on this phenomenon to validate the performance of HotSpot3D for identifying functional 
variants. Specifically, we first conducted validation using Reverse Phase Protein Array 
(RPPA) expression data to assess whether predicted clusters in EGFR actually have higher 
levels of protein expression/autophosphorylation than either the wild type or mutations 
outside clusters. EGFR is an excellent test case because of the high number of mutations 
found across multiple patient samples and the two most significant clusters being highly 
cancer specific. The latter is important because RPPA varies by cancer type. We used the 
RPPA values to examine EGFR protein expression and site-specific phosphorylation at 
major autophosphorylation sites pTyr1173 and pTyr1068.
We validated the two clusters in EGFR that exceeded the Cc threshold, one specific to GBM 
with centroid at Ala289 from the extracellular domain and the other specific to LUAD with 
centroid at Leu858 from the kinase domain. The mean protein and phosphoprotein 
(pTyr1173 and pTyr1068) levels were significantly higher in GBM samples with mutations 
from the Ala289 cluster as compared to wild type EGFR, P=2.3e-8, P=1.9e-5, P=1.5e-6, 
respectively (Figure 6a) Means were also higher than for samples with EGFR mutations 
outside of any cluster, but there were insufficient data to establish this observation as 
statistically significant. Almost all of the mutations for LUAD in the kinase domain are from

 the L858 cluster, so here we focus on comparing it to the wild type. Mean protein and 
phosphoprotein (pTyr1173 and pTyr1068) levels were again significantly higher for samples 
containing a mutation in the Leu858 cluster, P=0.01, P=0.04, P=4.6e-5, respectively (Figure 
6a). We also conducted validation on one ERBB2 cluster in the kinase domain having its 
centroid at Val842Ile using RPPA data for ERBB2 protein expression and 
autophosphorylation site pTyr1248. This cluster exhibited the same trend as the two EGFR 
clusters; the mean protein and phosphoprotein (pTyr1248) levels were the highest for 
samples having mutations in the Val842Ile cluster (Methods).
We also performed EGFR phosphorylation experiments on mutations from the EGFR 
Leu858Arg cluster in cultured NIH3T3 cells to more conclusively assess functional 
predictions from HotSpot3D. This cluster included well-known mutations such as 
Leu858Arg, Gly719Ala, and Thr790Met. Additional rare mutations, having no available 
direct evidence of autophosphorylation consequence, include Asp761Asn, Ile789Met, 
Arg831His, and Leu833Phe, although a few reports suggested weak/partial response to 
tyrosine kinase inhibitors in samples with other known druggable mutations23–25. Our 
phosphorylation experiment targeting autophosphorylation site pTyr1068 showed a low level 
of pTyr1068 phosphorylated EGFR (pEGFR, 0.21, normalized by the total EGFR) in the 
wild type without EGF treatment (Figure 6b). Leu858Arg, Gly719Ala, and Thr790Met have 
higher levels of normalized pEGFR (0.79, 0.89, and 1.08, respectively), indicating ligand-
independent activation. Asp761Asn, Ile789Met, Arg831His, and Leu833Phe also yielded 
higher levels of normalized pEGFR (0.78, 0.38, 0.32, and 0.55, respectively), suggesting 
potential ligand-independent activation as well (Figure 6b). In addition, similar to 
Thr790Met and Gly719Ala, Asp761Asn shows a much higher normalized pEGFR level 
(1.76) when compared to the wild type (1.08) under EGF stimulation. These observations 
demonstrate that some of the variants do not just have ligand-independent activation; their 
levels of autophosphorylation upon EGF stimulation can be higher than that of the wild type 
(Figure 6b and Supplementary Table 17). Furthermore, we performed an experiment 
examining sensitivity of the EGFR variants to gefitinib. We found that Thr790Met is 
resistant to gefitinib, consistent with previous reports26. The other 6 variants are all sensitive 
to gefitinib (Figure 6c). In aggregate, these results furnish convincing evidence of the 
HotSpot3D approach.
Mutation-drug networks and clinical implications
The HotSpot3D drug module targets mutations in spatial proximity to actionable sites for 
pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals derived from DrugPort (Methods). We identified 394 
significant drug-mutation clusters involving 153 drugs and 359 genes (Supplementary Table 
2, 18). Top HGNC gene families and drug classes are in Supplementary Note (Figure 7a and 
Supplementary Tables 19, 20, 21). While we have obtained drug-mutation relationships from 
multiple databases (Methods), only 14 unique mutations (with different amino acid position 
and/or change) in the clusters have been reported in these sources, implying the remaining 
844 unique mutations are potentially novel drug interacting candidates.
Of particular interest, we have detected 48 protein kinases, interacting with 21 drugs (Figure 
7b) with strong mutation-drug clusters found in EGFR, BRAF, KSR2, ERBB3, CDK7/8, 
Niu et al.

 and ABL1. Our analysis also showed that 24 out of the 394 mutation-drug clusters have 
cluster closeness scores greater than 2.5 (Table 1), including several protein kinases (BRAF, 
ERBB3, EGFR, PDK3, and NTRK1), nuclear hormone receptors (ESR1 and PPARD), CD 
molecules (ACE, CD40LG, and ITGAX), as well as tumor suppressors (TP53 and VHL). 
Among the kinase-drug clusters, BRAF (a serine/threonine kinase) with sorafenib (a 
tyrosine kinase inhibitor) tops the list due to hotspots at Val600 and Lys601. Interestingly, 
there are 8 unique BRAF mutations in this cluster: Arg462Lys, Gly469Ala/Arg, 
Asp594Gly/His/Asn, Gly596Asp, and Val600Arg that are each observed in one or two 
samples. Three of these mutations (Arg462Lys, Gly469Arg, Gly596Asp) are not in the 
current releases of MyCancerGenome (MCG), CancerDR (CDR), Personalized Cancer 
Therapy (PCT), or Gene-Drug Knowledge Database (GDKD), and eight (Gly469Ala, 
Asp594Gly/His/Asn, Val600Glu/Lys/Arg, and Lys601Glu) are present in at least one or 
more of these databases, but have unknown effects on drug binding affinity. Our analysis 
lends weight to the potential druggability of the 3 functionally unknown, unique BRAF 
mutations (Figure 7c). We also found two drug-mutation clusters of ERBB3 in which 8 of 
the 9 unique mutations were not catalogued in these databases (from the extracellular 
domain cluster: Val104Leu/Met, Ala245Val, Gly284Arg in GDKD, Lys329Glu/Thr, R103H, 
and R388Q and from the kinase cluster: L792V) and V104 is the centroid mutated in 11 
samples. The larger ERBB3 cluster evidently interacts with 4 n-acetyl-d-glucosamine (NAG) 
molecules throughout the extracellular domain spanning both receptor L domains and the 
Furin-like cysteine rich region. The second ERBB3 cluster involves bosutinib, a tyrosine 
kinase inhibitor. Two EGFR drug-mutation clusters were found in which 11 out of 16 unique 
mutations are novel (Figure 7d). None of the three mutations of the PDK3 drug-mutation 
cluster have been reported in the four druggable mutation databases (Arg299Cys/Ser and 
Phe324Leu). The three mutations of NTRK1 were likewise not found in these databases 
(Arg649Leu/Trp and Arg702Cys) and are observed with an acetic ion binding in the C-
terminal lobe adjacent to the binding pocket and DFG motif (within 10Å).
ESR1, PPARD, and PPARG top the nuclear hormone receptor family of mutation-drug 
clusters (Supplementary Table 18). The ESR1 cluster with Cc = 4.6, has 4 unique mutations 
interacting with 5 different compounds: raloxifene, estradiol, estrone, estriol, and 
diethylstilbestrol (Figure 7e). Raloxifene is a FDA-approved estrogen receptor modulator for 
reducing the risk of invasive breast cancer27, while estradiol, estrone, and estriol are 
estrogenic hormones functioning through ESR1. Arg394His/Leu mutations in ESR1 form 
significant pairs with all 5 compounds and could potentially affect their responses (Figure 
7e). HotSpot3D analysis suggests multiple putative therapeutic options for one mutation, but 
functional validation will still be required for confirmation and to determine which drug is 
most appropriate. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPARD) is found with 2 
unique mutations, His287Arg and His287Tyr, adjacent to icosapent, a micronutrient which 
has been used to treat a variety of symptoms and diseases and most notably has been 
suggested to improve chemotherapy response28. Another PPAR drug-mutation cluster 
involves 6 unique PPARG mutations that are associated with 4 drugs (indomethacin, 
pioglitazone, rosiglitazone, and telmisartan) (Supplementary Table 18). The action site for 
indomethacin, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), neighbors all 6 mutations 
of the cluster, while the sites for pioglitazone and rosiglitazone (anti-diabetic drugs) and

Ile290Met), three (Ile290Met, Arg316Cys, and His494Tyr), and two (Arg316Cys and 
E352K) mutations, respectively. It is significant that, although none of these drugs has any 
previously known use in treating cancer, their action sites have all been found near a 
frequently mutated binding pocket in cancer. Both clusters of ESR1 and PPARG exist in the 
hormone receptor domain, suggesting that drug binding in this region may be affected by 
cancer mutations.
The drug-module in HotSpot3D allows users to identify mutation-drug clusters involving 
multiple drugs, independent of on-label (drug approved for a specific mutation manifested 
by a specific disease) status, as well as drugs interacting with mutations from multiple genes. 
For example, ABL1, from the 8th ranked kinase cluster, interacts with four tyrosine kinase 
inhibitors (TKIs): bosutinib, dasatinib, imatinib, and nilotinib; each has been used for 
treating chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) patients with the BCR-ABL fusion29, 30. 
Although there are only three unique mutations (Val390Leu, Asp400Tyr, and Phe401Leu) 
observed in the ABL1 drug cluster, the cluster closeness measure is significantly increased 
due to the four drugs involved. Each of the Asp400 and Phe401 residues, from the DFG 
motif, controls blocking of the binding pocket by conformational changes and therefore 
modulates the binding of imatinib and nilotinib. The gatekeeper in ABL1, Thr315, which 
controls ATP access to the binding pocket, was not found to be mutated in the TCGA dataset 
studied, but the gatekeeper in EGFR, Thr790, is found in its own TKI drug-mutation cluster 
with erlotinib, gefitinib, and lapatinib. Both Thr315 in ABL1 and Thr790 in EGFR are 
shown to confer drug resistance to TKI therapy, indicating similarly positioned mutations in 
drug families have the same effects within a drug class31. Further, we found that the DFG 
motif is also mutated in BTK (PheGly540LeuCys), another tyrosine kinase. Notably, 
mutations in three genes, ABL1, BTK (including Leu528Phe), and BMX (Gly424Glu), are 
within the spatial interaction range of dasatinib (Supplementary Fig. 3). Overall, HotSpot3D 
provides the means to identify complex, multi-dimensional interactions among drugs and 
mutations and consequently to find alternative therapeutics that may provide greater 
flexibility in treating a wide range of genetic diseases.
Discussion
The enormous numbers of available variants and protein structures offer an unprecedented 
resource for investigating the direct impact these variants have upon protein structures, 
which is fundamentally important to the design of targeted cancer drugs. Here, we developed 
HotSpot3D to provide novel capabilities not found in existing tools: 1) It handles any 
mutation and variation data, has no limitation on the number of clusters per protein, and 
considers all available structures, thus maximizing the potential for novel cluster/interaction 
discovery for studies not limited to cancer. 2) It unifies discovery of many different entities 
under a single algorithm: significant clusters within a single protein, at the interface of 
protein-protein complexes, and near drugs. It is the first tool to effectively handle drug-
mutation clusters. 3) It provides comprehensive downstream analyses in prioritizing clusters 
that are significantly enriched in mutations from multiple patient samples and supports rare/
medium recurrent functional mutation discovery.

 We used HotSpot3D to analyze TCGA Pan-Cancer data, discovering a large set of mutations 
and revealed their relationships with known drivers. This is a rich resource for future 
functional explorations (Supplementary Table 22). Our HotSpot3D drug analysis also 
indicated that only 14 unique mutations in the significant mutation-drug clusters have been 
reported in the four standard databases we searched, implying discovery of over 800 novel 
drug interacting candidate mutations. The larger implications of this work are threefold: 1) 
using non-cancer drugs for treating cancers, 2) applying cancer-type specific drugs for 
treating patients with other types of cancers, and 3) employing targeted drugs for treating 
patients with non-canonical cancer mutations that cluster with known druggable mutations.
Although we have experimentally validated a small subset of predictions using high 
throughput phosphorylation data and in vitro cell-based assay, additional experimental 
testing of all putative novel drivers and drug interacting mutations discovered in our study is 
required to confirm their biological functions. We envision that structure-based analyses 
using HotSpot3D will lead to discoveries of many types of relationships among variants 
undetectable by conventional approaches, for example, in human variations identified from 
population-based studies, as well as germline variations and de novo mutations that play 
roles in many common diseases.
Online Methods
HotSpot3D and code comparison
HotSpot3D (see URLs) has three parts: data preprocessing, structural analyses, and 
visualization (Figure 1a). For SpacePAC comparison, we used the “SimMax” option, cluster 
radii 2-10 angstroms, up to 3 clusters, and 1000 simulated configurations. We restricted 
HotSpot3D to the single molecule information available to SpacePAC and configured its 
parameters for an unbiased comparison: no linear separation, links formed with distance p-
values, and 10 angstrom maximum cluster radius. We retained only the most significant 
clusters for SpacePAC and used the average inner cluster distance between constituent 
residues as a test statistic. Permutation testing was performed for each cluster residue mass 
(number of residues in a cluster) for each structure. For cluster k of mass m, there are n = 
m(m-1)/2 residue pairs among all residues, which have an average of d̄k. For each m, we 
sampled 106 sets of n random pairs, and for the lth set we obtained the average inner cluster 
distance, d̄l. The p-value for the kth cluster of mass m is the proportion of sets with average 
inner distance less than d̄k.
Data preprocessing
Genes and their transcripts and proteins are procured from public sources, including the 
Human Genome Organization (HUGO). Preprocessing extracts four features from the 
HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) (see URLs): HGNC gene name, Universal 
Protein Resource (UniProt32) ID, gene synonyms, and description.
UniProt is a comprehensive database for protein sequence and annotation data. For each 
HUGO gene, UniProt ID was used to retrieve PDB IDs from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) 
(see URLs), transcript and protein IDs from Ensembl, sequence from UniProt, and region of

 interest (ROI) information. For each ROI, corresponding information contains initial and 
destination coordinates of UniProt sequence and specific function description. By comparing 
each UniProt sequence with all known and novel peptide sequences of human build GRCh37 
(Ensembl release 74), we identified and kept only those transcripts having the same 
translated length and sequence identity ≥98%. We only allowed one top Ensembl transcript 
match based on alignments with UniProt sequences.
This process culminates in an association table containing each HUGO gene, its UniProt, 
PDB, and transcript IDs, and sequence identity with UniProt sequence (Supplementary 
Table 23). This table was used for PDB-related 3D distance calculations and conversion 
between PDB and UniProt coordinates. This information is stored in a MySQL database and 
a flat file.
3D proximal pairs analysis
3D distance calculation—UniProt ID enables protein structure data to be extracted from 
PDB33. For each of the 25,627 PDB structures, one or more chains could correspond to the 
UniProt sequence. Here, we used the longest chain containing the amino acid of interest to 
calculate 3D distances between amino acids. In case of multiple identical MODELs, one is 
picked randomly. We take intra-molecular interactions as any pair from the same UniProt 
ID, regardless of chain in homomer complexes. Inter-molecular pairs are between amino 
acid pairs from different UniProt ID’s within the same PDB structure.
Distance is calculated as follows. Given a pair, AA0 and AA1, and their respective sets of 
atomic coordinates in space, AA0 and AA1, the distance between them, D(AA0,AA1), is the 
minimum 3D distance between all atoms of AA0 and of AA1:
(1)
where d is the distance between atoms i and j from AA0 and AA1, respectively, and the 
amino acids range either over a single chain or over two chains, depending on context.
Significance determination and prioritization—To calculate significance of distance 
between mutations, we statistically analyzed all possible 3D distances within each PDB 
structure. Permutation-based P-value for each pair of amino acids is the proportion of all 
pairwise 3D distances less than or equal to D(AA0,AA1). To reduce false-positives due to 
proximal residues in primary sequence, amino acid pairs must be separated by at least ΔN 
residues along the protein sequence. Here, we use the following empirically derived criteria: 
P < 0.05, D ≤ 10Å, and ΔN > 20 for intra-molecular clusters, while D ≤ 20Å was allowed for 
inter-molecular and drug-mutation clusters. This procedure generates a data set consisting of 
the residue pairs and their 3D distance, linear distance, and p-value for each PDB structure.
Variant List Input—For a given MAF or VCF input, transcript ID and amino acid change 
information from Ensembl annotation must be provided for each variant. Based on the 
association table, variants map to specific UniProt IDs. From the 3D proximity results, the

 amino acid change information was then used to map the variant to a specific location within 
the UniProt sequence. Using 3D proximity results, COSMIC annotation information, and 
ROI information, we conducted 3D proximal pairs analysis for a given variant list. 
Ultimately, our method reports 5 kinds of proximity information: mutations in ROI, close to 
ROI, close to each other, at COSMIC locations, and close to COSMIC mutations. Users can 
extract pairs of mutations that are in close proximity to each other within a single protein, as 
well as on protein-protein complexes.
Drug interaction module
HotSpot3D includes a drug-protein interaction module based on data from DrugPort (see 
URLs), which contains structures of drugs and their target proteins in PDB, the latter derived 
from DrugBank34. The version of DrugPort used here contains 1,492 approved drugs and 
1,664 unique protein targets, in which there are 480 molecules in all (425 drugs and 55 
nutraceuticals) contained within 21,603 PDB structures. Each drug, has four attributes: 
number of different targets, number of targets with known structure in PDB, number of 
drug-bound target structures, and total number of drug-bound structures. There is an 
important preprocessing step to establish the relationship between mutations and PDB 
structures containing each pharmaceutical. Using the DrugPort API, we parsed the raw 
DrugPort data file, obtaining DrugPort ID, PDB Het Group, drug molecule position in the 
PDB structure, and flag information. Het records describe non-standard residues, such as 
prosthetic groups, inhibitors, solvent molecules, and ions for which coordinates are supplied. 
Flag information identifies whether the structure is a target protein or not a target protein but 
which nevertheless contains this drug molecule. Using these pre-processing results as input 
for each drug, the HotSpot3D drug-protein interaction module can search mutations to 
determine whether any are within the three-dimensional distance cutoff of each drug.
Cancer mutation data set and cancer types
We analyzed somatic mutations (Supplementary Table 24) from 4,405 TCGA tumor samples 
from 19 cancer types: bladder urothelial carcinoma (BLCA), breast adenocarcinoma 
(BRCA), cervical squamous cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma (CESC), 
colon and rectal carcinoma (COAD, READ), glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), head and 
neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC), kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), kidney 
renal papillary cell carcinoma (KIRP), acute myeloid leukaemia (LAML; conventionally 
called AML), low-grade glioma (LGG), lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), lung squamous cell 
carcinoma (LUSC), ovarian serous carcinoma (OV), pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD), 
prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD), skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM), stomach 
adenocarcinoma (STAD), thyroid carcinoma (THCA), and uterine corpus endometrial 
carcinoma (UCEC).
Identifying mutation and drug-mutation clusters
Mutations in proximal pairs are assigned to different clusters. To seed initial clusters, we 
start from significant proximal pairs, iteratively adding new mutations if they are 
significantly paired with a mutation already in that cluster. Because this procedure can form 
large clusters by the “chaining effect”, as each addition lacks knowledge of the overall 
cluster size, we require a “stopping rule” to limit growth. Specifically, we identify the

 centroid of the cluster as the mutation having the highest closeness centrality and discard 
mutations outside its threshold radius (see below).
Formally, a cluster is an undirected graph G = (V,E), where V is a subset of the 
nonsynonymous mutations from the input and E is the set of proximal pairs from V 
identified by HotSpot3D. Two options are available for selecting V: 1) the set of all non-
truncational mutations, V = V1 2) the set of unique mutations affected by the mutation 
cohort without recurrence, V = V2 (a proximity only approach). Let νi, νj ∈ V for i, j ∈ 
{1,2,…,N} where N is the number of vertices in V. Edges ei,j ∈ E are distances, where |ei,j| = 
di,j for paired elements vi and vj, and |ei,j| = ∞ for vertices that are not paired. For V = V1, |
ei,j| = di,j = 0 if vi and vj are recurrent mutations as well as different amino acid changes at 
the same residue, and for V = V2, |ei,j| = di,j = 0 if vi and vj are different amino acid changes 
at the same residue. Clusters are built-up by the Floyd-Warshall shortest paths algorithm, 
initialized by the distance matrix of the edges, to obtain the geodesics, gi,j between each vi 
and vj. Unique clusters emerge as disjoint subsets in V having infinite geodesics between 
any two elements from different clusters. For each νi ∈ V, we then calculate the closeness 
centrality35, c(vi),
(2)
where N is the number of vertices in the cluster. For each cluster, the centroid is the vertex 
whose closeness centrality is the maximum. Finally, clusters can be focused according to 
user input for the cluster radius limit. The cluster radius limit is the maximum geodesic 
measured from the cluster centroid; any vertices outside this bound are pruned. For intra-
molecular clusters, we used a radius limit of 10Å to keep clusters small and dense spatially. 
For inter-molecular, we used a larger limit of 20Å, since we are spanning across multiple 
proteins.
Clustering for drug-mutation pairs follows the same approach. Multiple instances of the 
same drug in a single protein are considered a single entity, despite the possibility of binding 
in several places. All mutations significantly paired with the drug, regardless of binding 
location, are included in the initial cluster, even if the mutations themselves are not close to 
one another. Conversely, one drug binding within a protein is treated separately from the 
same drug bound to other proteins, forming disjoint clusters; each cluster only includes 
mutations from a single protein. The cluster radius is again 20Å.
Prioritizing clusters with high cluster closeness
We focused on top clusters for downstream analyses using cluster closeness (Cc) as a 
measure to establish thresholds. Cc is simply the sum of the closeness centralities over each 
mutation in a cluster. High Cc indicates spatially dense clusters enriched in mutations from 
multiple patient samples. Here, we distinguished between clusters with cancer genes and 
non-cancer genes. We generated Cc distributions for both groups, using Wilcoxon testing to 
verify that they were significantly different and that Cc was in fact a good metric to 
determine functionality of clusters. We observed that clusters with cancer genes had

 significantly higher Cc than clusters without (P ≈ 5.3e-13). We could use the Cc threshold to 
identify novel cancer genes that exhibit similar tightness and enrichment of mutations in 
clusters as cancer genes. We wanted a stringent Cc threshold focusing on a small, 
conservative subset of intra-molecular clusters, so we defined the threshold as the top 5% 
cutoff of the cancer gene group (Cc = 10.283) (Figure 2a). To get an idea of the spatial 
“tightness” this threshold implies, an idealized equilateral tetrahedron having all equal 
geodesic distances, g, would indicate threshold of N2/2g ≥ 10.283 from Eq. (2), whereby g ≤ 
ln(N2/10.283)/ln(2). Substituting N=4 for the tetrahedron, each vertex would be a distance of 
0.64Å at most from all the others. For inter-molecular analysis, we distinguished clusters 
with all cancer genes, at least one cancer gene, and no cancer genes. We created Cc 
distributions for all three groups. Here, clusters with cancer genes also had significantly 
higher Cc than clusters having none. Due to significantly fewer inter-molecular clusters, we 
defined the threshold as the top 20% cutoff for the all cancer gene group (Cc = 4.118) 
(Figure 2b), which equates to a maximum geodesic distance of 1.96 Å in the idealized 
tetrahedron model.
Cluster conservation score
The phastCons score36 quantifies conservation of mutated and deleted bases. Each cluster is 
scored by the weighted average of its variants’ phastCons scores, with variants weighted by 
recurrence. For each intra-molecular cluster, we compared Cc to cluster conservation score 
to evaluate whether clusters occur in functionally important regions: 70% (4,083 out of 
5,822 intra-molecular clusters) have a high score (above 0.95). T-testing on mutations within 
clusters versus mutations not in clusters showed clustered mutations’ preference for 
conserved regions (P < 2.2e-16). Clusters with high Cc tend to have a high conservation 
score, and we found 547 clusters from 542 cancer genes, including all 38 of the top intra-
molecular clusters, among the high cluster conservation score group. Clusters of cancer 
genes segregate as oncogene, TSG, or unclassified (general) cancer genes, and cluster 
conservation between groups is compared for clusters exhibiting high Cc. T-tests on clusters 
with top Cc failed to show significant difference between oncogenes and TSGs in terms of 
cluster conservation, both for the top 38 intra-molecular clusters and the top 100 clusters (p-
values of 0.1036 and 0.7733, respectively).
Cluster validation
Reverse Phase Protein Array (RPPA) data—Using the subset of the TCGA cohort 
having available RPPA data, we examined EGFR protein expression and site-specific 
phosphorylation at major autophosphorylation sites pTyr1173 and pTyr1068. Here, we 
discarded the linear limit on clustering because proximal mutations in the linear sequence 
may be functionally significant. We examined GBM samples, dividing them into 3 
categories: having mutations from the EGFR Ala289 cluster, having mutations outside of 
any cluster, and having no EGFR mutation. The same method was applied to LUAD 
samples, the cluster of interest being Leu858Arg. Protein and phosphoprotein levels were 
retrieved for the 3 categories. Welch’s t-test was used to determine if the mean protein and 
phosphoprotein levels were significantly higher in samples from the first category, as 
compared to samples from the other two categories. Similar methodology was used for 
ERBB2.

 Phosphorylation functional experiments: NIH3T3 (clone2.2) cells were kindly provided 
by Dr. Robert Friesel (Maine Medical Center Research Institute). These cells have typical 
fibroblast morphology, undetectable levels of endogenous EGF receptor, characteristic of 
this subclone37, and were negative for mycoplasma, based on the absence of extranuclear 
signals by DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) staining. Cells were cultured in DMEM 
(Corning) supplemented with 10% calf serum (ThermoFisher) and penicillin/streptomycin 
(Life Technologies). All plasmids for the expression of EGFR variants were generated from 
the wild-type EGFR plasmid (Sino Biological) using Q5 site–directed mutagenesis (New 
England Biolabs). All constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Cells were transiently 
transfected with wild-type or mutant EGFR constructs using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent 
(Life Technologies) in 6-well plates. 24 hours after transfection, cells were switched to 
medium containing 0.5% calf serum for 24h before stimulation with 50ng/ml recombinant 
human EGF (R&D Systems) for 10 minutes. Cells were lysed in buffer containing 20mM 
Tris-HCl (pH7.5), 150mM NaCl, 1mM Na2EDTA, 1mM EGTA, 1% NP-40, 1% sodium 
deoxycholate, 2.5 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1mM c-glycerophosphate, 1%, 1mM 
Na3VO4, 1ug/ml leupeptin (Cell Signaling). Protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche) 
were added immediately before use. Samples were boiled in buffer and subjected to SDS-
PAGE on 10% polyarcrylamide gels and Western blotting was done on Immobilon-P PVDF 
membranes (Millipore). The following antibodies were used for immunoblotting: anti-
phospho-EGFR Tyr1068 (Abcam, Tyr1092 in the unprocessed EGFR), anti-EGFR (Abcam) 
and anti-β-Tubulin (DSHB). Appropriate secondary antibodies with infrared dyes (LI-COR) 
were used. Protein bands were visualized using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-
COR).
Mutation and drug annotations
ClinVar contains clinical variant annotation for 19,801 genes and 129,758 variants (see 
URLs). The Pancan19 MAF was annotated with available ClinVar clinical variant 
information. Of the 549,295 unique mutations observed in the TCGA dataset, 805 had 
pathogenic information from ClinVar.
We curated mutations from 4 databases: MyCancerGenome, PCT, GDKD, and CancerDR. 
MyCancerGenome catalogs cancer mutations, therapeutic options, available clinical trials, 
and druggability information for 43 genes (including receptor tyrosine kinases like EGFR, 
KIT, and PDGFRA) and 289 relevant variants. PCT, or the Personalized Cancer Therapy, 
contains druggability information for variants of 24 cancer-related genes and over 140 gene 
variant-drug interactions supported by clinical evidence. GDKD, or the Gene-Drug 
Knowledge Database, provides information on predictive genomic markers for over 40 
malignancies and tumor-type sensitivity/resistance for specific gene variants to approved or 
experimental drugs. More than 700 variant-specific gene–drug interactions with therapeutic 
relevance were curated for this effort. CancerDR lists 148 anticancer drugs and their 
effectiveness against 1000 cancer cell lines. Pharmacological profiles of these drugs were 
collected from the CCLE and COSMIC databases as IC50 values. CancerDR contains 
information for 116 drug targets, including their corresponding gene sequences in cancer 
cell lines. Drug/sequence interactions that resulted in an IC50 value ±2 S.D. of the mean 
were used.

 Prioritized variant list for functional validation
We prioritized putative drivers that would be good candidates for experimental validation 
(Supplementary Table 22), based on rare and medium recurrent variants appearing in 
clusters above the intra-molecular and inter-molecular Cc thresholds. The variants were 
ranked according to closeness centralities and only the top 10 variants were included per 
gene.
Software engineering aspects
We developed an interactive browser-based visualization portal (see URLs) to help assess 
whether a mutation interaction is likely to have functional importance. It maps individual 
mutations onto a PDB structure, displays potentially interacting mutation pairs or clusters, 
and provides for graphic annotation. Users can load individual mutations, multiple 
mutations, or HotSpot3D results and review all protein structures that contain the residues of 
the mutations. As an example, Supplementary Figure 4 shows two mutations from TCGA 
kidney cancer data, one from TCEB1 and the other from VHL. The client side of the portal 
runs within any native browser implementation, depending only on the Java plug-in to run 
the open-source Jmol Java applet for displaying protein structures. The webserver is Apache 
Tomcat 7 running JSP programs and a Java servlet as an interface to access the underlying 
MySQL database of pre-processed biological information. The entire server runs on a Dell 
PowerEdge M620 blade server, with one 8-core Intel Xeon E-2603 1.8 GHz CPUs, and 128 
GB of RAM.
We analyzed clustering algorithm performance using robustness trials (Supplementary 
Note), where random mutations were chosen and run through the HotSpot3D clustering 
module. We observed O(n3) time where n represents the number of input mutations, which is 
consistent with the characteristic time complexity of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm. Other 
algorithms that might provide performance gains would do so only under special constraints 
on the graph that are not guaranteed to exist for problems of this type.

 Figure 1. HotSpot3D workflow, robustness simulations, and comparison to SpacePAC
a) HotSpot3D work-flow can be grouped to three processing steps, (from left to right), Data 
Preprocessing, Structural Analysis, and Post Processing. First, annotation resources from 
several databases are used to contextualize input datasets, including user-defined DNA 
variants. Variants are then annotated and mapped onto appropriate PDB structures. DrugPort 
annotations are used to map pharmaceutical/nutraceuticals onto PDB molecules as a part of 
the drug module. Mutation pairwise calculations are performed and users can perform 
clustering of the paired mutations. Users can then visualize mutation clusters along with

 annotated information. Analyses by users can then lead to in silico discoveries for functional 
validation hypotheses. b) Robustness simulations show a steady reduction in the percentage 
of clusters found relative to the percentage of the variant set used. Error bars represent one 
standard deviation from the mean over 50 random trials. c) Cluster mass distributions show 
steady decline in clusters of all sizes. Each variant percentage curve (below 100%) is an 
average over the random trials represented in panel b. d) Significant mutation clusters (P ≤ 
0.05) are shown as circles found by HotSpot3D (red) and SpacePAC (blue). The number of 
residues in each cluster is shown for each structure, labeled by HUGO Symbol and PDB ID. 
Centers are slightly offset from each residue number, with SpacePAC on the left and 
HotSpot3D on the right. For all structures, molecule chain A was used. The size of each 
circle indicates the average inner cluster distance.

 Figure 2. Significant spatial clusters
Panels are divided into intra-molecular (a) and inter-molecular (b) results and purple and 
green shading denoting gene type, i.e. cancer and non-cancer genes, respectively. a) List of 
intra-molecular clusters having the highest cluster closeness as defined by the same type of 
threshold procedure on cluster closeness distribution (inset). b) List of inter-molecular 
clusters having the highest cluster closeness, with threshold set at top 20% (inset). Here, 
inter-molecular clusters are divided into 3 groups: clusters of strictly cancer genes (purple), 
clusters with at least one cancer gene (blue), and cluster composed solely of non-cancer 
genes (green) and axis labels only include the top two genes contributing the most number 
of mutations. Multiple clusters within a single protein or protein complex are differentiated 
with a numerical suffix in parentheses.

 Figure 4. Intra-molecular and inter-molecular clusters with unique hotspot mutations and novel 
mutations
Numbers of unique hotspot and novel mutations are indicated by bubble area and y-axis 
position, respectively. a) Intra-molecular clusters: Proteins are labeled on the x-axis and each 
bubble denotes a cluster from each protein. b) Inter-molecular clusters: Clusters are labeled 
on the x-axis and bubble colors correspond to member proteins (multiple clusters involving 
the same proteins are designated in parenthesis). Hollow bubbles indicate that a protein has 
novel unique mutations but does not have a hotspot.

 Figure 5. Polar plots showing rare/medium recurrent functional mutation discovery in intra-
molecular and inter-molecular clusters
Centroids (black) and mutations are represented by bubbles. The latter are ordered clockwise 
according to primary sequence position, with the radial extent proportional to centroid-
mutation spatial distance (rather than geodesics used for clustering). Bubble area indicates 
number of samples in which the mutations are found. Outer and inner rings represent, 
respectively, the entire protein linear sequence and a subsection within which the mutations 
are found. Corresponding clusters on the 3D protein structure are shown below each polar

 plot. Although there is a linear limit of 20 peptides between paired mutations (Methods), 
clusters represent networks with edge lengths as the pairwise distance, thus picking up 
mutations between linearly limited mutations through chaining mutations. a) KRAS Gly12 
cluster, with colors indicating mutation distance from the centroid, and corresponding 3D 
protein structure. b) MAP2K1 Pro124 cluster with same scaling as panel (a) and 
corresponding 3D structure. c) SMAD2/3/4 clusters with centroid located at SMAD4 
Arg361 (top left) and SMAD4 Asp537 (top right). The three proteins are distinguished on 
the polar plots by differing colors of the outer and inner rings (which correspond to protein 
backbone color on 3D structure) and slight variation in hue for the bubbles. SMAD3/
SMAD4 complex 3D structure on bottom left shows SMAD4 Arg361 (purple) and SMAD4 
Asp537 (orange). SMAD2/SMAD4 complex 3D structure is on bottom right with same 
color key.
