ABSTRACT
Influenza virus vaccine production is currently limited by the ability to
grow circulating human strains in chicken eggs or in cell culture. To facilitate cost-
effective growth, vaccine strains are serially passaged under production conditions,
which frequently results in mutations of the major antigenic protein, the viral hem-
agglutinin (HA). Human vaccination with an antigenically drifted strain is known
to contribute to poor vaccine efficacy. To address this problem, we developed a
replication-competent influenza A virus (IAV) with an artificial genomic organization
that allowed the incorporation of two independent and functional HA proteins with
different growth requirements onto the same virion. Vaccination with these viruses
induced protective immunity against both strains from which the HA proteins were
derived, and the magnitude of the response was as high as or higher than vaccina-
tion with either of the monovalent parental strains alone. Dual-HA viruses also dis-
played remarkable antigenic stability; even when using an HA protein known to be
highly unstable during growth in eggs, we observed high-titer virus amplification
without a single adaptive mutation. Thus, the viral genomic design described in this
work can be used to grow influenza virus vaccines to high titers without introducing
antigenic mutations.
IMPORTANCE
Influenza A virus (IAV) is a major public health threat, and vaccina-
tion is currently the best available strategy to prevent infection. While there have
been many advances in influenza vaccine production, the fact that we cannot pre-
dict the growth characteristics of a given strain under vaccine production conditions
a priori introduces fundamental uncertainty into the process. Clinically relevant IAV
strains frequently grow poorly under vaccine conditions, and this poor growth can
result in the delay of vaccine production or the exchange of the recommended
strain for one with favorable growth properties. Even in strains that grow to high ti-
ters, adaptive mutations in the antigenic protein hemagglutinin (HA) that make it
antigenically dissimilar to the circulating strain are common. The genomic restructur-
ing of the influenza virus described in this work offers a solution to the problem of
uncertain or unstable growth of IAV during vaccine production.

nfluenza A virus (IAV), a member of the family Orthomyxoviridae, is a negative-sense
RNA virus with a segmented genome (1). Seasonal IAV is a major public health
concern, causing nearly 5 million cases of severe illness a year and an estimated 250,000
to 500,000 deaths (2). Vaccination is the main strategy used for limiting the public
health burden of this virus, and neutralizing antibodies (Abs) directed against the
hemagglutinin (HA) protein are thought to be the most important contributors to

 protection (3). Influenza virus vaccines are normalized based solely on HA content (4),
and recombinant HA protein-only vaccines are FDA approved and currently in use (5).
Current trivalent and quadrivalent inactivated egg- and cell-based influenza vac-
cines rely on incorporating the glycoproteins from one of the desired strains into a
standardized influenza virus genetic background, amplifying the virus, and then inac-
tivating and partially purifying viral proteins for vaccination (6). The vaccine production
process can be delayed due to poor growth of the reassortant viruses under laboratory
conditions (7–9), and in extreme cases, the failure to grow a desired strain for vaccine
production can lead to its complete exclusion from a multivalent vaccine formulation
(10). This has been a problem particularly for recent human subtype H3 IAV strain-
derived HA proteins that frequently display poor infectivity in embryonated chicken
eggs (11–13).
Further, IAV vaccines are notorious for displaying variable rates of protection (14,
15). Poor vaccine efficacy is frequently blamed on improper vaccine strain selection or
antigenic drift of circulating viruses; however, recent work has shown that the viral
antigens acquire mutations during vaccine production, which leads to human vacci-
nation with an antigenically dissimilar virus (16, 17). Thus, the ability to predictably
grow any influenza virus strain to high titers, without altering the structure or antige-
nicity of the HA protein, would represent a significant improvement to current influ-
enza virus vaccine production.
RESULTS
To improve the vaccine production process, we decided to generate a replication-
competent IAV that incorporated two different HA proteins onto the same virion. We
reasoned that by pairing a laboratory-adapted HA with a second HA protein, derived
from a circulating pathogenic IAV strain, we could ensure robust growth of the
resultant IAV regardless of the growth characteristics of the second HA and thereby
reduce the selective pressure on this HA to mutate.
To accomplish this goal, we needed to establish a genomic organization that would
encode two functional HA proteins. There have been reports of successful exogenous
expression of foreign reporter proteins from the polymerase segments as well as IAV
segments 8 and 6 (reviewed in references 18 and 19). All of the previously published
reports, however, either generated virus-reporter fusion proteins or left residual amino
acids that would inactivate a second HA protein. Since all previously published strat-
egies were unsuitable for our purposes, we first needed to develop new methods to
insert proteins into IAV that would not result in modifications to these proteins. For a
rapid readout of virus rescue, we began by attempting to insert fluorescent proteins.
Since the IAV HA gene encodes an N-terminal signal peptide which mediates
appropriate subcellular localization and then is removed to generate the mature HA
(20), we reasoned that encoding a fluorescent mRuby2 gene before the protein would
not leave any additional amino acids on HA after signal peptide removal. To ensure that
the signal peptide was recognized during translation, we engineered a porcine tescho-
virus 2A (PTV1-2A) motif to separate the fluorescent reporter and HA (Fig. 1A). Thus, the
mRuby2 sequence should be released from the nascent polypeptide as the ribosome
translates the PTV1-2A sequence and remain in the cytoplasm, while the HA signal
peptide should be recognized and then removed during normal HA trafficking to the
plasma membrane. We were able to rescue this virus in the H1N1 A/Puerto Rico/8/1934
(PR8) background and show that the resultant virus grew to high titers (Fig. 1B). In
multicycle growth, the kinetics were similar to those of the parental strain (Fig. 1C). The
HA segment is normally highly expressed in infected cells, and we were readily able to
detect infected cells via microscopy and flow cytometry assays, with the brightness of
the reporter related to the multiplicity of infection (MOI) (Fig. 1D and E). While red
fluorescent proteins are useful to minimize signal overlap with green autofluorescence
in tissue sections (21, 22), they display lower brightness than do green or yellow
fluorescent proteins (23, 24). We therefore also rescued a virus expressing the excep-
tionally bright mNeonGreen protein (25) in the HA segment and performed flow

 cytometry (Fig. 1E and F). Quantification of the brightness of infected cells for both
viruses was performed at 24 h postinfection, with an observed ~35-fold increase for the
mRuby2 virus and an ~300-fold increase for the mNeon virus (Fig. 1F). Thus, we were
able to encode foreign proteins in segment 4 of IAV with minimal effects on virus
growth and no residual amino acids left on the viral HA protein. Finally, we assessed the
stability of our mRuby2-HA virus over 4 serial passages in eggs. We observed no change
in segment length or loss of fluorescence (Fig. 1G and H), indicating that the virus
tolerates these manipulations. We also verified that the brightness of the virus did not
decrease during the passaging, as well as performing plaque assays to ensure that no
minor population of the stock had lost fluorescence (see Fig. S1A to C in the supple-
mental material).
While our segment 4 design was successful in producing wild-type HA protein, there
were residual C-terminal amino acids left from the PTV1-2A motif on the mRuby2
protein. Thus, we would ultimately not accomplish our goals by simply incorporating
two HA proteins in segment 4. However, previous work has shown that foreign proteins
can be expressed on the C terminus of the neuraminidase (NA) encoded in segment 6.
Importantly, in those reports NA was forced to tolerate residual amino acids left on the
C terminus after 2A-mediated protein separation (26, 27). To generate an untagged NA
protein as a second, complementary approach to HA expression, we aimed to take
advantage of cellular peptidases to remove tags left on the proteins at a PTV1-2A
cleavage site. Previous work on recombinant protein expression has shown that after
introduction of the furin cleavage site RKRR, recognition by furin protease and subse-
quent cleavage by carboxypeptidases completely eliminate the residual motif (28). We
adapted this approach and encoded mNeon after the NA protein, separating the two
proteins by a furin cleavage site and a PTV1-2A site (Fig. 2A).
Rescue and characterization of this virus showed that the virus grew to high titers
and replicated with kinetics similar to those of the parental PR8 virus (Fig. 2B and C).
Infected cells were readily detected, and the brightness was quantified via flow
cytometry (Fig. 2D and E). To assess the activity of NA-furin-mNeon versus wild-type
(WT) NA, we rescued viruses with FLAG-tagged versions of both neuraminidases (29)
and then purified NA and performed a sialidase assay (Fig. 2F). The slight reduction in
activity likely indicates that not all of the NA is fully processed by the furin protease as
intended, potentially leaving some amino acids on the N terminus (diagrammed in
Fig. S2). Finally, we assessed the stability of our NA-furin-mNeon virus over 4 serial
passages. We again observed no loss of the reporter gene or decrease in brightness
(Fig. 2G and H; Fig. S3A to C). Thus, we have developed two ways to express foreign
proteins, one in segment 4 and one in segment 6, which leave little to no residual
modification on the viral proteins and are well tolerated by the virus.
We theorized that by combining these strategies we could express both the HA and
the NA glycoprotein from a single viral segment. We therefore encoded the NA protein,
followed by a furin cleavage site, then PTV1-2A, and finally the HA protein, in segment
4 (Fig. 3A). Since seven-segment influenza viruses are known to grow poorly (30), we
encoded the fluorescent protein ZsGreen in segment 6, where NA is normally encoded,
as a placeholder (Fig. 3A). We successfully rescued this virus and observed that the virus
expressed the reporter protein and grew to high titers (Fig. 3B and C) despite the
reorganization of the glycoproteins. We also observed extremely high expression of the
ZsGreen reporter protein (Fig. 3D and E), likely due to the addition of an artificial
consensus Kozak signal in front of the reporter protein.
Since expressing HA and NA in a single segment was well tolerated by the virus, we

 returned to our original goal of a dual-HA IAV and designed a virus to express both a
subtype 1 and a subtype 3 HA simultaneously (Fig. 3F). We encoded the original PR8 H1
protein in segment 4 (along with the NA protein) and encoded an additional H3 protein
(from A/Hong Kong/1968) in segment 6 (where NA is normally located). We chose H1
and H3 HAs because these two IAV subtypes are currently circulating in humans, and
we wanted to assay the ability of this technology to allow the incorporation of both
subtype H1 and H3 HA proteins on the same virion. We were able to rescue this virus
and found that it grew to high titers, with no statistical difference in endpoint titer from
the parental PR8 strain, but with a delay in the kinetics of viral growth (Fig. 3G and H).
We were also able to detect viral plaques with antibodies specific for either subtype 1
or subtype 3 HAs after infection with the H1/H3 dual-HA virus (Fig. 3I). The plaque size
of the dual HA virus was reduced compared to the parental PR8 strain but was similar
to the A/Hong Kong/1968-PR8 reassortant strain X31 (Fig. S4). We also determined the
levels of the HA proteins in the dual-HA background relative to the H1 parent PR8 or
the H3 parent X31 via Western blot analysis. Using purified virions, we observed that
the H1/H3 virions packaged similar levels of the H1 and H3 glycoprotein to the
single-HA parent strains (Fig. 3J).
To quantify the total amount of HA on the surface of the virion, we rescued a double
PR8 H1/H1 dual-HA virus and performed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) on the purified virions with an H1-specific antibody. We observed that the
double-HA virus packaged more HA protein than the single HA parent, as expected
from our Western blot analysis (Fig. 3K). NA activity levels were slightly reduced relative
to parental PR8, likely indicating a slight reduction in the amount of the NA protein
packaged (Fig. S5). We also performed a sandwich ELISA with monoclonal antibodies
specific for the PR8 or HK68 HA to demonstrate that the two HA proteins were being
packaged onto the same virion (Fig. 3L). In order to assay the stability of the second HA
protein, we injected 20 embryonated chicken eggs with the dual H1/H3 virus. After 72 h
of viral growth, a plaque assay was performed with each of the 20 viral populations.
Plaques visible to the eye were stained with an H3-specific monoclonal antibody; we
observed that every plaque was positive for the HK68 HA protein (Table S1).
We next tested the functionality of both the H1 and H3 HAs in our dual-HA virus. We
incubated our dual-HA virus with neutralizing monoclonal antibodies specific for either
the H1 or the H3 HA. We observed that only when we mixed the two antibodies
together were we able to completely neutralize the dual H1/H3 virus (Fig. 3M and N).
We reasoned that the delay in viral replication kinetics due to increased genome size
would significantly attenuate the virus. We therefore tested the ability of the H1/H3
virus to act as a live attenuated vaccine without additional mutations. C57BL/6 mice
were infected with a range of doses of either the parental PR8 strain or the H1/H3 strain.
Despite high morbidity and mortality of the parental PR8 strain, our H1/H3 virus caused
no mortality at the tested doses (Fig. 4A to D). Despite the difference in disease, high
levels of antibodies were elicited by the H1/H3 virus infection in surviving animals
(Fig. 4E and F). Furthermore, these antibodies were found to neutralize virus at similar
levels as those elicited from the parental PR8 infection, as determined by HA inhibition
(HAI) and plaque reduction assays (Fig. 4G to J). Sera used for both HAI and plaque
reduction assays were treated with sialic acid receptor-destroying enzyme (RDE) to
eliminate nonspecific inhibition of viral binding mediated by serum components other
than antibodies (31, 32).
Since most IAV vaccines are inactivated, we also wanted to evaluate the dual-HA

 virus in this context. To inactivate the virus for administration, we formalin treated
either the H1N1 (PR8), H3N2 (X31), or H1/H3 dual-HA virus and intramuscularly vacci-
nated mice. After vaccination and a single boost, we found that mice vaccinated with
either PR8 or X31 produced high levels of the corresponding HA antibodies (Fig. 5A and
B). Mice vaccinated with PR8 and X31, however, showed no detectable antibody
response to the reciprocal HA, while the dual-HA H1/H3 virus vaccination led to equal
or higher levels of antibodies to both of the HAs relative to the single-HA vaccines.
We next wanted to characterize the safety profile of our dual-HA virus in more detail.
We therefore incubated the H1/H3 virus with polyclonal sera reactive against either PR8
or X31. Both of these sera were able to completely neutralize the dual-HA virus,
showing that preexisting immunity from vaccination to one of the HA subtypes is
sufficient to neutralize a “bivalent”virus (Fig. 5C). HAI and plaque reduction assays with
RDE-treated sera raised against the H1/H3 virus revealed functional inhibition of PR8
and X31 receptor binding and virus infection, respectively, with the same efficacy as
sera derived from vaccination with either of the single-HA parents alone (Fig. 5D to G;

 Fig. S6). Finally, we performed challenge experiments to show protection after vacci-
nation in vivo. While vaccination with PR8 was able to protect from PR8 challenge, it
was unable to protect from X31 challenge (Fig. 5H and I; Fig. S7A and B). Similarly,
vaccination with the monovalent X31 virus was able to protect against X31 challenge,
but it was not able to protect against PR8 challenge (Fig. S7C to F). Vaccination with the
H1/H3 dual-HA virus, however, fully protected mice from challenge with either PR8 or
X31 (Fig. 5H and I; Fig. S7A and B), indicating that the antibodies generated after H1/H3
virus vaccination are protective.
We next evaluated the breadth of HA proteins that could be expressed in the
context of a double-HA virus. Current quadrivalent IAV vaccines are a mixture of IAVs
with a subtype 1 and subtype 3 HA, as well as influenza B viruses from both the Victoria
and Yamagata lineages. We therefore rescued double-HA viruses with the PR8 HA and
a representative HA from each of these strains. We observed robust growth (without
any HA mutations) for all of the recombinant viruses (Fig. 6A and B), indicating that
there was no functional interference between the two HA proteins. To test our
approach with a current and clinically relevant H3 strain, we rescued a dual-HA virus
expressing the HA from the A/Victoria/210/2009 strain, which was included in the
Fluarix quadrivalent vaccine produced by GlaxoSmithKline for 2017 to 2018. As ex-
pected, this virus grew to levels similar to those of our other bivalent viruses, and upon
sequencing after several rounds of growth in eggs, we detected no mutations in the
entire open reading frame (ORF) of the A/Victoria/210/2009 HA (Fig. S8).
Finally, we wanted to evaluate the antigenic stability of an HA protein that is
normally unstable during growth in embryonated chicken eggs. We selected the HA
from A/Fujian/411/2002 (Fujian02), which is a well-characterized H3N2 strain that is
known to grow extremely poorly in eggs and rapidly acquires adaptive HA mutations
to facilitate growth (9, 10, 33). After rescuing a dual PR8/Fujian02 HA virus and growing
a purified stock (which represents several rounds of growth), we observed high-titer
growth in embryonated chicken eggs that was significantly increased (~4 orders of
magnitude) compared to the standard 6�2 reassortant in the PR8 background (Fig. 6C
to E). Previous work has shown that robust growth of A/Fujian/411/2002 requires the
acquisition of several characteristic mutations to the HA protein (9, 10, 33). We
therefore extracted RNA from our egg-grown dual PR8/Fujian02 population and se-
quenced the A/Fujian/411/2002 HA encoded in segment 6. Sequence analysis con-
firmed that the HA sequence of our dual-HA virus did not contain any of the previously
identified adaptive mutations (Fig. 6F and G). In fact, there was not a single adaptive
mutation in the entire ORF of the A/Fujian/411/2002 HA.
DISCUSSION
We began this study with the goal of developing a viral genetic system that would
allow antigenically stable, high-titer growth of influenza viruses for vaccine production
regardless of the intrinsic properties of a specific HA protein. We accomplished this task
by expressing two functional HA proteins on a single, replication-competent virus. We
first developed new methods to express untagged proteins from IAV segments 4 and
6 and subsequently combined the HA and NA proteins into segment 4. The final step
was to add an additional HA into segment 6. Previous attempts to make bivalent
influenza viruses have had limited success; the viruses required extensive genome
alterations, which resulted in a major decrease in fitness—greater than a 3-log10
reduction in titer (34, 35). Our dual-HA viruses grew to high titers (~108 PFU/ml) and in
some cases grew to titers indistinguishable from the parental PR8 strain (~109 PFU/ml).
Our approach required modifications to only segments 4 and 6. Thus, this technology
is fully compatible with current vaccine production methods which insert segments 4
and 6 from a circulating strain into a standardized genetic background (36). Impor-
tantly, our dual-HA viruses displayed fundamentally reduced virulence, almost certainly
due to the drastically increased genome size and the resulting effects on viral replica-
tion kinetics. The virus is also completely neutralized by polyclonal sera raised against
either of the hemagglutinins, further highlighting the safety of this design.

 Our dual-HA virus approach was designed to promote recombinant virus growth
irrespective of the nature of the specific HA used and to fully preserve the viral
antigenic epitopes. Some human strains of influenza virus (especially H3N2 strains)
initially grow poorly as reassortants in embryonated chicken eggs (11, 37), which delays
vaccine production. Recently, in 2009, poor growth of pandemic A/California/07/2009
H1N1 swine flu vaccine candidates delayed vaccine production by months (7, 8), and in
2002, the H3N2 A/Fujian/411/2002 strain grew so poorly that although it was the major
circulating strain at the time, it could not be included in the seasonal vaccine (9, 10).
This led to vaccine/circulating strain mismatch and poor vaccine efficacy in 2003 and
2004 (38). We have directly demonstrated the utility of our approach by generating a
dual-HA version of the A/Fujian/411/2002 strain. We observed immediate, robust virus
growth in chicken eggs that was substantially higher than that with a standard
reassortant of A/Fujian/411/2002, and there was no requirement for adaptive muta-
tions. The implication of our data is that, had this technology been available in 2002,
A/Fujian/411/2002 could have been grown and included in the seasonal vaccine and
human influenza that season likely would have been significantly reduced.
The other major goal of this study was to preserve the antigenicity of a human HA
protein during growth in embryonated chicken eggs, where variants with altered
antigenicity frequently arise due to differences in virus receptor structures between
mammals and birds (39–41). Studies have shown that even in years when the strain
selected for vaccine production matches the circulating strain, mutations acquired
during amplification of the vaccine strain can lead to poor protection after vaccination
(16, 42). Our results showed that by pairing an HA that allows high-titer growth under
the growth conditions of interest (such as that from PR8) with a clinically relevant HA
that is known to mutate easily (such as that from A/Fujian/411/2002), the selective
pressure to fix adaptive mutations in the second HA can be entirely eliminated. While
difficult-to-grow strains can eventually be adapted to grow to high titers in eggs, this
requires the serial passage of the relevant IAV reassortant in eggs, resulting in the
acquisition of adaptive mutations in the viral glycoproteins, which must then be
carefully screened for effects on antigenicity (37). Our dual-HA genetic approach
completely eliminated the need for this time-consuming step.
We also observed increased HA density on the surface of the dual-HA virion, which
by definition increases the amount of HA antigen relative to other viral proteins. Thus,
a dual-HA virus has the potential to deliver the same amount of HA antigen in a smaller
amount of total protein, which may increase vaccine tolerance and decrease side
effects. Finally, this technology is not restricted to expressing solely influenza virus
proteins. It can theoretically also be used as a platform to produce vaccines with a
combination of influenza virus and non-influenza virus antigens while nevertheless still
utilizing the current influenza vaccine production infrastructure.
In conclusion, we have developed two independent ways to express foreign pro-
teins in IAV and combined those approaches to generate a replication-competent,
dual-HA “bivalent” virus. We have shown that our viruses require no adaptation step
and allow high-titer, antigenically stable growth of essentially any clinically relevant
influenza A or B virus HA protein. This technology is fully compatible with current
vaccine production practices and can be immediately utilized to facilitate rapid and
cost-effective production, as well as to potentially increase the protective efficacy, of
influenza virus vaccines.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cells and antibodies. Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were grown in minimal essential
medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, HEPES, NaHCO3, GlutaMAX, and penicillin-
streptomycin. 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco’
s modified Eagle’
s medium (DMEM) supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum, GlutaMAX, and penicillin-streptomycin. Monoclonal antibodies specific for PR8
H1 (PY102), HK68 H3 (XY102), and influenza virus M1 (E10) were provided by Tom Moran at the
Experimental Therapeutics Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.
Cloning and rescue of recombinant viruses. Recombinant viruses were generated as previously
described (43) by use of the bicistronic pDZ rescue plasmid system. Viral protein sequences were
generated from rescue plasmids from the A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 H1N1 background. Fluorescent proteins

 and linker sequences were synthesized using influenza A virus codon usage preferences (IDT), and viral
packaging signals were used as previously described (44). Primer sequences are listed in Table S2 in the
supplemental material. The PR8 NA FLAG virus has been previously described (29). InfusionHD (Clontech)
or the NEBuilder HiFI DNA assembly kit (NEB) was used to assemble DNA fragments before transforma-
tion into Clontech Stellar competent cells, per the manufacturer’
s instructions. Insert size was then
confirmed by colony PCR, and inserts were sequenced via Sanger sequencing before use in viral rescue.
The plasmid (kindly provided by Richard Webby) for the rescue of the WT A/Fujian/411/2002 reassortant
virus has the same sequence as that deposited in GenBank under accession number CY112933.1 with
three nonsynonymous nucleotide changes, a T to A at position 610 and an A to G at positions 736 and
987. The following viral HA genes were synthesized (IDT) with silent mutations to eliminate the normal
packaging signals. The sequence used for the A/Fujian/411/2002 dual-HA virus is the same as that
deposited in GenBank under accession number CY112933.1 with one nonsynonymous nucleotide
change, a G to T at position 769. The sequence used for the A/Victoria/210/2009 dual-HA virus is the
same as that deposited in GenBank under accession number HM459583.1. The sequence used for the
B/Malaysia/2004 dual-HA virus is the same as that deposited in GenBank under accession number
CY119706.1 with two nonsynonymous nucleotide changes: an A to G at position 42 and a C to T at
position 638. The sequence used for the B/Yamagata/1988 dual-HA virus is the same as that deposited
in GenBank under accession number CY018765.1 with three nonsynonymous nucleotide changes, a G to
A at positions 484 and 645 and a C to A at position 652. Virus rescue plasmids were transfected into 293T
cells using the Mirus TransIT-LT1 reagent along with the remaining viral RNA segments from WT PR8.
Rescued virus was then propagated in 10-day-old chicken eggs (Charles River) at 37°
C for 72 h.
Viral titer. Prior to titer determination, 30 to 50 PFU of each dilution-purified stock of virus was
injected into eggs and incubated at 37°
C for 72 h. Then, the allantoic fluid was collected, and viral titer
was determined via standard plaque assay procedures on MDCK cells. Cells were incubated for 1 h in
333 �l of diluted virus suspension at 37°
C, before removing the virus and applying the agar overlay. Cells
were then incubated at 37°
C for 72 h before being fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in phosphate-
buffered saline (PBS) for at least 4 h. The 4% PFA was then aspirated, and the agar layer was removed
before washing cells in PBS and incubating them at 4°
C overnight in mouse serum from PR8-infected
mice. Mouse serum was diluted 1:2,000 in antibody dilution buffer, which was made using 5% (wt/vol)
nonfat dried milk and 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS. After the overnight incubation in primary antibody, plaque
assays were washed with PBS three times and then incubated for 1 h in anti-mouse IgG horseradish
peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated sheep antibody (GE Healthcare) diluted 1:4,000 in antibody dilution buffer.
Assays were then washed three additional times with PBS and incubated in 0.5 ml of True Blue reagent
for 30 min to allow for the staining of plaques. Once plaques were visible, plates were washed with water
and allowed to dry before counting (only wells with greater than 5 plaques were used for the calculation
of endpoint titer).
Microscopy time course. Microscopy images were taken using MDCK cells infected with various
MOIs of either the reporter virus or WT virus. Cells were infected in 300 �l of virus for 1 h at 37°
C; after
this incubation period, the infection medium was removed and cells were placed in complete medium.
At the indicated time after infection, MDCK cell medium was removed and replaced with 1 ml of warm
PBS. Cells were then incubated with Hoechst stain (0.5 �l/ml of PBS) to allow for the staining of nuclei,
and imaging was performed on the Zoe fluorescent cell imager (Bio-Rad). Images were then processed
with ImageJ (NIH).
Flow cytometry. MDCK cells were infected for approximately 24 h before being trypsinized and
collected for flow cytometry. Raw data were collected on a FACSCanto II (BD) machine, and data were
processed with FlowJo software.
Viral passaging and RT-PCR. Virus was passaged in 10-day-old eggs purchased from Charles River
Laboratories, Inc. Thirty to 50 PFU of each virus was injected into two eggs for each passage. Eggs were
incubated for 72 h at 37°
C in a humidified egg incubator before collection of the allantoic fluid. Virus was
confirmed in the sample by hemagglutination assay before being injected into a new set of eggs. The
passage 0 and 4 samples were subjected to Trizol RNA extraction. Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) was
performed using the Superscript III one-step RT-PCR kit according to the manufacturer’
s instruction with
segment-specific primers. Samples were run on a 1% agarose gel and imaged. Microscopy images were
taken 24 h postinfection, and microscopy was performed in the same manner as that described
previously for time courses.
Western blotting. Virions were concentrated using a 30% sucrose cushion for 1 h at 25,700 rpm on
the Sorvall TH-641 swinging bucket rotor. Equal amounts of protein were loaded into 4 to 20%
acrylamide gels and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Five percent nonfat dry milk in PBS plus
0.1% Tween 20 was used to block for 1 h, and a 1:1,000 dilution of primary antibody PY102, XY102, or
E10 was incubated overnight. An anti-mouse–HRP secondary antibody was incubated for 1 h, and the
blot was exposed to film. The membrane was then stripped for reprobing with the E10 M1 antibody.
HAI assay. Hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assays were performed using 107 PFU of virus per well,
diluted in cold PBS. These samples were then mixed with a range of dilutions of monoclonal antibodies
or sera collected from vaccinated mice. All data shown containing sera are from pooled, receptor-
destroying enzyme (RDE)-treated samples. All samples were treated according to Denka Seiken Co.’
s
protocol with RDE (II) Seiken (catalog no. 370013). Once virus and antibody were mixed together, an
equal amount of chicken blood diluted 1:40 in cold PBS was mixed with each sample and incubated at
4°
C for approximately 30 min.
Plaque reduction assay. All plaque reduction assays were performed on MDCK cells. Virus was
diluted to 50 PFU and mixed with antibody before being incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The

 virus-antibody mixture was then applied to the cells and incubated for an additional 30 min at 37°
C,
shaking the samples every 10 to 15 min to ensure that cells were evenly covered by the mixture. After
the incubation, the solution was aspirated and an agar overlay was applied. Plaque assays were then
performed as described above, and plaques were counted. All data shown containing sera are from
pooled, receptor-destroying enzyme (RDE)-treated samples. All samples were treated according to Denka
Seiken Co.’
s protocol with RDE (II) Seiken (catalog no. 370013).
Sandwich ELISAs. For the sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), 96-well plates
were coated with 100 �l of 5 �g/ml of mouse anti-H3 XY102 (IgG2) by overnight incubation at 4°
C in a
carbonate buffer. Plates were then washed twice with 150 �l of PBS and blocked with 1% bovine serum
albumin (BSA) in PBS for 1 to 2 h at room temperature. A 2-fold serial dilution in the blocking buffer was
then added to the plate and incubated overnight at 4°
C (a starting concentration of 5% BSA was used
for the BSA control). After this incubation, plates were washed twice with PBS and then incubated with
100 �l of 1 �g/ml of the subtype H1-specific antibody PY102 (IgG1) for 3 h at 37°
C, and the antibody was
detected by goat anti-mouse IgG1 conjugated with HRP (Thermo Fisher Scientific) (1:2,000).
ELISAs. Virions were concentrated using a 30% sucrose cushion for 1 h at 25,700 rpm on the Sorvall
TH-641 swinging bucket rotor. Samples were then resuspended in 1 ml of PBS, and protein concentration
was determined via the Bradford method. Ninety-six-well plates were then coated at 4°
C with a range of
protein concentrations using a carbonate buffer overnight. All samples were diluted to the same starting
concentration (5% BSA was used as the starting concentration for the BSA control). Plates were then
washed twice with 150 �l of PBS and blocked with 1% BSA in PBS for 1 to 2 h at room temperature. After
this incubation, plates were washed twice with PBS and then incubated overnight at 4°
C in 100 �l of a
mixture of 1:2,000 PY102 (an H1-specific mouse antibody) and 1:1,000 XY102 (an H3-specific mouse
antibody) diluted in 1% BSA-PBS. Plates were then washed twice with PBS and incubated for 1 to 2 h at
room temperature in 100 �l of 1% BSA-PBS containing 1:5,000 goat anti-mouse HRP-conjugated
antibody (Ab). Plates were then washed twice with PBS and incubated in tetramethylbenzidine (TMB)
HRP substrate for approximately 20 min. At this time, or when the lowest dilution began to saturate with
color, 100 �l of 1 M sulfuric acid was added to each well to stop the reaction and absorbance was
measured at 450 nm on a plate reader.
Animal infections. Eight- to 10-week-old C57BL/6 mice were used for all experiments, with a sample
size of at least 4 mice per dose of virus. Prior to infection, mice were anesthetized with a 100-�l injection
of a ketamine-xylazine mixture. Mice were weighed and marked, and 40 �l of virus diluted in
pharmaceutical-grade PBS was administered intranasally. Mice were weighed daily and euthanized once
their body weight reached 80% of the starting weight measured prior to infection as a humane endpoint.
Euthanasia was performed via CO2 as the primary method, and a bilateral thoracotomy was performed
as the secondary method. Viral challenge of vaccinated mice was performed using this procedure as well.
All procedures were approved by the Duke University IACUC.
Vaccination of mice. Mice were vaccinated with inactivated virus in order to examine the potential
efficacy of our virus as a vaccine. Virus was concentrated and inactivated with PFA. Prior to injection, PFA
was removed with Thermo Scientific Slide-a-Lyzer dialysis cassettes according to manufacturer instruc-
tions. Protein samples were then diluted to 70 �g/ml in pharmaceutical-grade PBS. Mice were sedated
as previously mentioned, and a 100-�l vaccination was administered intramuscularly into the right leg
of each mouse. After 2 weeks, mice were vaccinated once more in the same fashion and given another
2-week period before challenge or collection of serum.
Cell-based ELISA. 293T cells were trypsinized and resuspended in 293T medium at a concentration
of 1 � 105 cells/ml and plated on 96-well plates that were poly-L-lysine treated. A transfection mixture
was made with 900 �l of Opti-MEM, 30 �l of TransIT-LT1, and 10 �g of DNA (either PR8 [H1]
hemagglutinin in the pDZ plasmid or HK68 [H3] hemagglutinin in the pDZ plasmid). This mixture was
incubated for 5 min before being added to the 293T cells in suspension. Plates were incubated at 37°
C
for 2 days before fixation in 100 �l of 4% PFA for 5 min. Plates were then put through the same ELISA
procedure listed above.
Neuraminidase activity assay. FLAG-tagged neuraminidase from both WT PR8 and the NA-furin-
mNeon virus was concentrated and purified from virions using Sigma-Aldrich anti-FLAG M2 magnetic
beads (M8823) according to the manufacturer’
s protocol. A Bradford assay was then performed to
measure protein concentration and standardize the samples. Once this was done, the Sigma-Aldrich
neuraminidase activity assay kit (MAK121) was used according to the manufacturer’
s protocol to evaluate
the activity of the respective neuraminidase proteins.
Statistical analysis. Comparison of data sets was performed using an unpaired, two-tailed Student
t test unless otherwise stated. Analysis was performed using Prism 7 (GraphPad) software.
