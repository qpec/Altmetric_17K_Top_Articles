Abstract
Background
Differences in asthma severity may be related to inflammation in the airways. The lower air-
way microbiota has been associated with clinical features such as airway obstruction, symp-
tom control, and response to corticosteroids.
Objective
To assess the relationship between local airway inflammation, severity of disease, and the
lower airway microbiota in atopic asthmatics.
Methods
A cohort of young adult, atopic asthmatics with intermittent or mild/moderate persistent
symptoms (n = 13) were assessed via bronchoscopy, lavage, and spirometry. These individ-
uals were compared to age matched non-asthmatic controls (n = 6) and to themselves after
six weeks of treatment with fluticasone propionate (FP). Inflammation of the airways was
assessed via a cytokine and chemokine panel. Lower airway microbiota composition was
determined by metagenomic shotgun sequencing.

 Results
Unsupervised clustering of cytokines and chemokines prior to treatment with FP identified
two asthmatic phenotypes (AP), termed AP1 and AP2, with distinct bronchoalveolar lavage
inflammatory profiles. AP2 was associated with more obstruction, compared to AP1. After
treatment with FP reduced MIP-1β and TNF-α and increased IL-2 was observed. A module
of highly correlated cytokines that include MIP-1β and TNF-α was identified that negatively
correlated with pulmonary function. Independently, IL-2 was positively correlated with pul-
monary function. The airway microbiome composition correlated with asthmatic pheno-
types. AP2, prior to FP treatment, was enriched with Streptococcus pneumoniae. Unique
associations between IL-2 or the cytokine module and the microbiota composition of the air-
ways were observed in asthmatics subjects prior to treatment but not after or in controls.
Conclusion
The underlying inflammation in atopic asthma is related to the composition of microbiota
and is associated with severity of airway obstruction. Treatment with inhaled corticosteroids
was associated with changes in the airway inflammatory response to microbiota.
Introduction
Asthma is a heterogeneous disease. Asthma phenotypes have been established on the basis of
underlying inflammation that may be predictive of treatment response and severity of disease.
For example, atopic asthma has been associated with T-helper (Th) 2 responses and develop-
ment of symptoms early in life, whereas other phenotypes have been associated with non-Th2
inflammation and development of symptoms later in life [1–3]. Recently, additional T-cell sub-
sets have been determined to have a role in the pathogenesis of atopic asthma, such as Th17
and T-regulatory (Treg) cells [4–9]. These subsets are responsible for immunity to specific
microbes or regulation of inflammation.
The composition of the airway microbiome in asthmatics has been associated with clinical
features, such as symptom control, severity of airway obstruction, and response to corticoste-
roid therapy [10–13]. Pathogenic bacteria (e.g., Haemophilus, Streptococcus, Moraxella, Kleb-
siella, and Rickettsia) in the upper and lower airways have been associated with the diagnoses
of asthma and potentially hold prognostic value for future diagnosis of asthma. [12, 14–16].
Bacteria of the upper airway and oral cavity can also be identified within the lower airways.
Notably, a high abundance of supraglottic taxa in the lower airways of healthy individuals has
been associated with Th17-like cytokine profiles in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) along with
increased lymphocyte and neutrophil counts in BAL [17, 18]. Thus, there is a strong link with
the airway microbiome and local airway inflammation, specifically with respect to T-cell phe-
notypes, in healthy individuals.
Recently, the relationship between the microbiome of the airways and immune response in
the airway of asthmatics has been explored [12, 19, 20]. Prior studies focused on changes in the
airway microbiome related to the presence of Th2 or Th17 responses in bronchial epithelium
and the cellularity of eosinophils and neutrophils in the airways. We hypothesized that there
are unique associations between inflammation, airway microbiome, and pulmonary function
in asthmatics. We analyzed cytokine concentrations in bronchoalveolar lavage of young adult,
atopic asthmatics (n = 13) and their relationship to the airway microbiome and lung function.

 In addition, we tested the impact of a short term, commonly used asthma medication, flutica-
sone propionate (FP) on airway inflammation and microbiome. Asthmatics were compared to
age matched non-asthmatic individuals (n = 6) and to themselves after treatment with flutica-
sone propionate. The subjects were free of smoking, signs of respiratory infection, and cortico-
steroid therapy in the preceding months to control for potential confounders that can affect
the microbiome and inflammation [11, 21, 22]. We identified two unique cytokine profiles
that were associated with airway obstruction and compositional changes in the microbiome.
These inflammatory changes were reduced after FP therapy, as well as association between the
cytokines and the microbiome composition. This indicates that the relationship between
inflammation and the microbiome is associated with pulmonary function in asthmatics.
Materials and methods
Subjects
The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in
the Sydney South West Area Health Service, protocol number X02-0137. Written informed
consent was obtained from all subjects, and no minors were included. BAL samples were
transferred and processed under our University of Illinois at Chicago approved IRB protocol
number 2015–0085.
Method and subject recruitment for bronchoalveolar lavage, allergen testing, serum IgE,
exhaled nitric oxide (NO), and spirometry has been described previously [23]. Briefly, bron-
choscopy took place following fasting for the previous 12 hours. Subjects were sedated with
doses of midazolam and alfentanil, based upon the subject’s initial response to treatment. Top-
ical anaesthesia (lidocaine) was introduced through the fiberoptic bronchoscope, with the
maximum dose determined by the subject’s weight. Following wedging of the bronchoscope in
the sub segmental airways, 4 x 60 ml (i.e. 240ml) aliquots of warmed sterile sodium chloride
(0.9% W/V) were instilled, with suctioning after each, into a single, sterile, ice-cold glass reser-
voir. Pooled bronchoalveolar (BAL) fluid was placed on ice and transported to the laboratory
for processing. BAL was centrifuged at 500 x g for 10, and BAL fluid aspirated and stored at
-80 until use. Adult volunteers between the ages of 19–30 years were recruited to participate in
the study. Asthmatic volunteers with intermittent or mild persistent or moderate persistent
atopic asthma (according to Global Initiative for Asthma, Global Strategy for Asthma Manage-
ment and Prevention, NIH Publication, Updated 2005) were included if they met the following
inclusion criteria: asthma symptoms in the preceding 12 months and positive mannitol bron-
chial provocation test. Individuals were excluded from the study if they had baseline FEV1 less
than 60% predicted, inhaled or systemic corticosteroid treatment in the preceding 2 months,
smoking in the preceding 12 months, greater than 5 pack year smoking history and symptoms
of upper respiratory tract infection in the past 6 weeks.
Study design
Subjects were initially screened at a baseline visit for their medical history, physical examina-
tion, exhaled NO, spirometry, mannitol challenge, allergen skin test, and Juniper Asthma Con-
trol Questionaire Score. One to four weeks post-intial visit subjects underwent bronchodilator
challenge, blood draw for serum IgE, and bronchoscopy with lavage and biopsy. As part of the
original Baraket et al. study [23], asthmatic subjects were then randomized into two dosing
strategies of inhaled fluticasone propionate (100 μg/BID and 500 μg/BID) delivered by metered
dose aerosol and large volume spacer. Subjects were provided with salbutamol metered dose
aerosol (100 μg) to be used as needed for asthmatic symptoms. Subjects were on no other med-
ications during the study period. Asthmatic subjects were assessed six weeks after initiating of

 inhaled fluticasone propionate for exhaled NO, spirometry, mannitol challenge, and Juniper
Asthma Control Questionaire Score. Seven weeks after initiating inhaled fluticasone propio-
nate subjects underwent bronchodilator challenge, and bronchoscopy with lavage and biopsy.
Spirometry and lung function reference values
Spirometric measurements were performed with a Vmax spirometer (SensorMedics, Yorba
Linda, California) using the closed circuit technique. Subjects were asked to withhold short
acting bronchodilators for at least 8 hours prior to the visit. No subjects were taking long act-
ing beta-2 agonists. Subjects were asked to not to consume caffeine or engage in vigorous exer-
cise on the morning of the visit. Predicted values were determined based on race, height, age,
and sex using the reference equations derived from NHANES III. Spirometry values were
interpreted using the ATS/ERS guidelines [24, 25].
Multiplex cytokine and chemokine assay
100 μL of BAL was centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 10 min to clear any cellular debris. Acellular
BAL was assessed for concentrations of sCD40L, MCP-1, MIP-1β, TNF-α, G-CSF, GM-CSF,
IFN-γ, IL-1β, -2, -4, -5, -6, -7, -8, -10, -12(p70), -13, -17A, -17F, -21, -22, -23, -25, -31, and -33
using Bio-Plex Pro™ Human Th17 Cytokine Panel 15-plex and Human Cytokine 17-plex
assays (Bio-Rad). Concentrations were determined using the Bio-Plex1 200 system and soft-
ware. IL-5 was excluded from analysis as no samples had concentrations within the detectable
range. Samples outside detectable limits were given the concentration of zero.
DNA extraction, metagenomic DNA library construction, and sequencing
BAL was removed of eukaryotic cells by centrifugation at 1000 x g for 10 min. To extract
microbial DNA from BAL, 1 mL of BAL was centrifuged at 22,000 x g for 2 hours at 4˚C.
Supernatants were removed and the pellet was treated with Lysozyme (Fisher Bio) in AL Buffer
(Qiagen) to lyse microbial cells. DNA was extracted from lysed pellets using QIAamp Virus
Spin Minelute kit (Qiagen) per manufacturer’s protocol. DNA libraries for sequencing were
constructed using Nextera XT DNA Library Prep Kit (Illumina). The quality and quantity
of all the DNA libraries were analyzed with DNA High Sensitivity Kit (Agilent) on the 2100
Bioanalyzer Instrument (Agilent) and Qubit (Invitrogen). The samples were sequenced as
described previously [26]. DNA libraries were pooled in equimolar concentration and were
sequenced following manufacturer’s protocol by multiplexing on Illumina MiSeq using the v3-
600 kit for 301 paired-end read length and included an additional 6 cycles for the index. The
average sequencing depth was 5,065,879 reads per sample.
De novo genomic assembly and annotation of metagenomic sequences
FASTQ files for each sample were mapped against the human genome at a fraction size of
0.500 bp and 95 percent identity to remove contaminating human genomic DNA. There was
an average of 116,200 unmapped reads (i.e. non-human or microbial reads) and 18,900,000
base pairs per sample. Unmapped reads were assembled into contiguous sequences at mini-
mum 300 base pair using CLC Genomics Workbench (CLC Bio). The assembly files were
uploaded on to the public database server MG-RAST [27] and taxonomy was assigned with
the minimum parameters of 60% identity, 10−5 e-value, and 60 amino acids alignment length
using MG-RAST’s M5NR database. Data for the samples that were sequenced have been
uploaded onto MG-RAST and are available under the Project ID: 12564.

 Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed in R (Version 3.3) unless otherwise specified. Cytokines
were standardized using z-score and principal component analysis (PCA) was performed
using Euclidean distances. Differential centroid testing for PCA was performed by permuta-
tion ANOVA (PERMANOVA) using Adonis. For determination of asthmatic phenotypes,
unsupervised clustering of the first six principal components was used for hierarchical cluster-
ing using Pearson’s correlations as distances and Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arith-
metic Mean (UPGMA) as the clustering algorithm. Optimal cluster number was assessed
using average silhouette width and cluster stability was determined using consensus clustering
[28]. Cytokine and chemokine concentration differences were tested using limma and pair-
wise contrasts [29]. Linear regression and ordinal logistic regression for cytokines or modules
was performed using univariate or multiple predictors. For multiple adjustment, modules
were adjusted for treatment with FP and the interaction of the module with treatment. Mod-
ules of cytokines were identified using significant Pearson’s correlations controlled for multi-
ple hypothesis testing (P < 0.05, Q < 0.05) and clustered using complete-linkage algorithm.
Clusters were said to be modules if five or more cytokines had interactions with each other to
control for clusters composed of spurious interactions. Detrended correspondence analysis
and microbiome correlation with phenotypes and clinical variables was performed using
vegan. Differential abundance of specific species was tested by pair-wise contrasts using
DESeq2 [30]. Slopes of univariate linear regressions with DCA1 as a linear predictor of cyto-
kines or modules were compared using ANCOVA. All subject’s clinical data was tested for sig-
nificant differences via Student’s T-test for continuous data or Chi-squared analysis with
bootstrap approximation for distribution for categorical data. P < 0.05 was considered statisti-
cally significant. For multiple testing procedures, Q values were determined to control for
Type I error [31]. P < 0.05 and Q < 0.1 was considered significant for multiple testing
procedures.
Results
Unsupervised clustering of cytokines and chemokines identifies
asthmatic phenotypes
We first assessed markers of inflammation between asthmatics and controls. We analyzed
bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cytokines and chemokines associated with T-cell responses and
found no significant differences between asthmatics and controls using principal coordinate
analysis (PCoA) and permutational MANOVA (PERMANOVA) (Fig 1A). We next queried
whether sub-classifications of asthmatics were present utilizing unsupervised hierarchical clus-
tering (S1 Fig). Two clusters of asthmatics were identified. We termed these clusters asthma
phenotype (AP) 1 and AP2. AP1 and AP2 were found to have high within cluster consensus
(AP1: 0.99 [95% CI 0.99–1.00], AP2: 0.97 [95% CI 0.96–0.98] Consensus Index) and low out of
cluster consensus (0.04 [95% CI 0.02–0.05] Consensus Index) (Fig 1B). Using the new classifi-
cation, there was significant separation between controls, AP1, and AP2 utilizing PCoA and
PERMANOVA (Pseudo-F test, P = 0.005) (Fig 1C).
The immunologic phenotypes, AP1 and AP2, differed in pulmonary function. AP2 was sig-
nificantly more obstructed with a lower FEV1 (% predicted). More individuals had mild or
moderate obstruction compared to AP1 (Table 1). Both phenotypes had positive bronchial
provocation tests with AP2 individuals requiring less mannitol to induce airway hyper-reactiv-
ity indicating more airway hyper-responsiveness in AP2 individuals. Though there were no
significant increases in AP2 compared to both control and AP1, there was a significant linear

vs. 13[7–25] vs. 24[12–47] (ppb), control vs AP1 vs. AP2, P = 0.007), basement membrane
thickness (mean [SD]: 8.1[1.0] vs. 9.1[1.2] vs. 9.5[0.7] (μM), control vs AP1 vs. AP2,
P = 0.038), and total serum IgE (GM [95% CI]: 51[11–229] vs. 204[60–698] vs. 303[88–1043]
(kU/L), control vs AP1 vs. AP2, P = 0.027), suggesting a more severe asthmatic phenotype (Fig
1D). With regards to age, sex, or body mass index (BMI), there were no significant differences
between controls, AP1, or AP2 (Table 1).
Significant differences in concentrations of BAL cytokines and chemokines were deter-
mined between controls, AP1, and AP2. AP1 had significantly decreased concentrations of
G-CSF, IFN-γ, and IL-17F compared to AP2 and controls (Fig 1E, Table A in S1 File). Con-
versely, AP2 had significantly decreased IL-2 and -10 compared to both controls and AP1.

ANOVA and Tukey’s post-hoc t-test, P < 0.05 was considered significant. BAL cytokines and chemokines were compared between controls and
asthmatic phenotypes by pair-wise comparisons using limma. Cytokines and chemokines are shown that were found to be significantly (P < 0.05,
Q < 0.1) enriched or depleted in (E) AP1 and (F) AP2. Each group is represented as mean and error bars are standard error of mean.

 AP2 also displayed increased concentrations of MIP-1β (CCL4) and TNF-α (Fig 1F, Table A
in S1 File).
Differentially expressed cytokine associate with airway obstruction
We assessed whether the cytokines and chemokines that were differentially abundant between
controls, AP1, and AP2 were also associated with the enhanced airway obstruction noted in
AP2. To test for associations with airway obstruction, we constructed models where cytokine
or chemokine concentrations were used as linear predictors of FEV1 (% predicted). IL-2 (β
[95% CI] = 9.922[1.243–18.600], R2 = 0.255, P = 0.027) and MIP-1β (β [95% CI] = -17.220
[-33.480–-0.921], R2 = 0.226, P = 0.039) significantly associated with FEV1 (% predicted) using
univariate linear regression (Fig 2A and 2B). To confirm that these were not only correlated
with low FEV1 (% predicted) in non-obstructed individuals, ordinal probabilistic models were
constructed for no, mild, and moderate obstruction. Both inflammatory mediators, IL-2 (β
[95% CI] = -1.841[-3.911–-0.160], P = 0.047) and MIP-1β (β [95% CI] = 3.861[0.897–7.471],

gest a role for IL-2 and MIP-1β in defining obstructive airway status.
Altered cytokine concentrations and reduced obstruction is observed
after inhaled corticosteroids
After six weeks of therapy with fluticasone propionate (FP) individuals in both phenotypes
had improved lung function with all but one individual in each group demonstrating airflow
obstruction (Table B in S1 File). There was no significant difference between AP1 and AP2
with regards to pulmonary function or symptom control after FP treatment. This improve-
ment in lung function corresponded to significantly (Tukey Post-hoc T-test, P < 0.05)
increased concentrations of IL-2 and decreased concentrations of MIP-1β, TNF-α, and frac-
tional exhaled nitric oxide in AP2 but not AP1 (Fig 3). There was no significant increase or
reduction in IL-10, G-CSF, IFN-γ, or IL-17F (data not shown).
Cytokine modules associate with asthmatic phenotypes and pulmonary
function
To determine if the cytokines that were differentially abundant between controls and asth-
matic phenotypes have effects that are independent or are correlated with other cytokines, we
constructed a correlation network of cytokines across all subject samples (n = 30) using signifi-
cant associations (Pearson’s correlations P < 0.05, Q < 0.05) (S2 Fig). We identified two mod-
ules of cytokines, Module 1 and Module 2 (Fig 4A and 4B). Module 1 was comprised of IL-1β,
-8, -31, -33, TNF-α, G-CSF, and MIP-1β. Module 2 was comprised of IL-17F, -21, -22, -25,

phenotypes pre- and post-FP (ANOVA P = 0.004), whereas Module 2’s variance was not sig-
nificantly associated with controls and asthmatic phenotypes pre- and post-FP (ANOVA
P = 0.349) (Fig 4C and 4D). In addition to Module 1 having increased abundance in AP2 pre-
FP, Module 1 had a significant negative association with both FEV1 (% predicted) and FEV1/
FVC (Table 2). Module 2 had a significant positive association with exhaled NO. Neither mod-

 within each module, we identified both MIP-1β and IFN-γ to have the highest correlation
(eigennode significance) with the abundance of their modules and influence over their module
(closeness centrality) (Fig 4E and 4F).
The airway microbiome varies between asthmatic phenotypes, non-
asthmatics, and after inhaled corticosteroid treatment
We hypothesized that the difference in cytokine profile in BAL was related to microbial com-
position that could be detected in the BAL. To test this we utilized shotgun sequencing of BAL
to determine the composition of the microbiome. We detected 656 taxa at the species level
with mean read count of one across all samples. We assessed for differences in α-diversity
across samples (S3A Fig). We found no difference between phenotypes and controls. There
was a significant increase in diversity after corticosteroid treatment in both phenotypes. To
assess between group diversity (β-diversity), taxa counts were normalized using median sum
scaling (see Methods) and fit onto detrended correspondence analysis to determine if there
was separation of samples along species gradients (S3B Fig). There was significant separation
of the phenotypes along the first correspondence axis (DC1) (Table C in S1 File).
To test which taxa were differentially abundant between controls, AP1, and AP2, normal-
ized taxa counts were fit to generalized linear models using the negative binomial distribution
(S4 Fig) and sample classification (control, AP1 pre-FP, AP2 pre-FP, AP1 post-FP, and AP2
post-FP) as linear predictors (Table D in S1 File). A trend toward higher error was noted with
taxa with low fitted counts, likely due to insufficient modeling of excess zeroes (S4C Fig). We
therefore choose to focus our analysis on the top 25 most abundant species, which all had a
mean abundance greater that 30 normalized counts. We detected seven species that were dif-
ferentially abundant (FDR adjusted P < 0.05) between controls, AP1 pre-FP, and AP2 pre-FP
(Fig 5A).
An increased abundance of Streptococcus pneumoniae was found in AP2 pre-FP compared
to AP1 pre-FP (Log2 Fold Change (L2FC) [95% CI]: 3.504[1.815–5.192], adjusted P = 0.002,
AP2/AP1) and controls (L2FC [95% CI]: 2.909[1.219–4.598], adjusted P = 0.002, AP2/control).

 There was also a trend toward increased abundance in Neisseria meningitidis in AP2 pre-FP
compared to AP1 pre-FP (L2FC [95% CI]: 1.998[0.586–3.409], adjusted P = 0.055, AP2/AP1)
and controls (L2FC [95% CI]: 3.216[1.774–4.659], adjusted P = 0.002, AP2/control). The
increase in these pathogenic species was not observed in AP1 pre-FP (S. pneumoniae adjusted
P = 0.816 and N. meningitidis adjusted P = 0.654). There was decreased abundance of Rothia
mucilaginosa, Actinomyces odontolyticus, and Actinomyces sp. oral taxon 180 in AP1 compared
to controls and AP2. Whereas, AP2 had decreased abundance of Enterococcus faecalis and fae-
cium compared to AP1 and controls (Tables E-G in S1 File).
After six weeks of FP treatment there were significant reductions in the abundance of S.
pneumoniae, N. meningitis, E. faecium, and E. faecalis (Fig 4). AP1 showed a significant reduc-
tion in E. faecalis (L2FC [95% CI]: -1.576[-0.854–2.298], P < 0.001, AP1 pre-FP/post-FP) and
E. faecalis (L2FC [95% CI]: -1.802[-2.987–4.277], P < 0.001, AP1 pre-FP/post-FP). AP2 had a
significant decrease in abundance of S. pneumoniae (L2FC [95% CI]: -3.139[-1.390–4.889],
P < 0.001, AP2 pre-FP/post-FP) and N. meningitis (L2FC [95% CI]: -1.708[-0.241–3.174], P =

cus, and A. sp. oral taxon 180 in either phenotype after fluticasone propionate treatment
(Tables H-J in S1 File).

 The airway microbiome is associated with differential cytokine
production observed in asthmatics
To further assess if the differences in the microbiome were related to differences in cytokines
we performed multiple regressions with DC1 as a linear predictor for cytokines in controls,
asthmatics pre-FP, and asthmatics post-FP. DC1 represents a gradient for the differentially
abundant species identified using generalized linear models (Fig 5B). Notably, E. faecalis and
E. faecium decrease along the gradient, whereas A. odontolyticus, A. sp. oral taxon 180, R. muci-
laginosa, and S. pneumoniae increased along the gradient. The relationship between cytokines
and DC1 was significantly different for IL-2, IFN-γ, TNF-α, and Module 1 (ANCOVA
P = 0.006, 0.030, 0.002, 0.007, respectively) when comparing controls, asthmatics pre- and
post-FP (Table 3). There were also trends in G-CSF, MIP-1β, and Module 2 (ANCOVA P =
0.096, 0.058, respectively). IL-2 had a significant negative association with DC1 in asthmatics
pre-FP not seen in controls or asthmatics post-FP. Conversely, Module 1 had significant posi-
tive associations with DC1 in asthmatics pre-FP not seen in controls or asthmatics post-FP
(Fig 5C and 5D). Differences in microbiome composition, pulmonary function, and cytokine
concentrations were not attributable to differences in FP dosing (S5 Fig).
Discussion
Within a homogenous group of atopic asthmatics (i.e. positive skin prick tests, elevated total
serum IgE, and elevated exhaled NO), we identified two distinct asthmatic phenotypes (AP)
termed AP1 and AP2. These are associated with differences in the local inflammatory milieu,
lower airway microbiota composition, and pulmonary function. We identified MIP-1β and IL-
2 as cytokines associated with the obstructive status in asthmatics. The abundance of these
cytokines was associated with composition of the microbiome. IL-2 dominant profiles were
associated with increased Enterococcus species, whereas MIP-1β dominant profiles were associ-
ated with Streptococcus pneumoniae and Oral taxa. We observed a reduction in MIP-1β and an
increase in IL-2 after inhaled corticosteroid therapy. Additionally, the associations between
the microbiome composition and cytokine profiles were diminished after inhaled corticoste-
roid therapy.
Interestingly, with regards to baseline pulmonary function, AP1 and AP2 resemble cluster 1
and 2 from Moore WC et al. (2010). In this large analysis, asthma phenotypes were identified
using unsupervised clustering of asthmatics based on clinical parameters [3]. All individuals in
our study had onset of asthma in childhood, positive skin prick tests, and elevated IgE, which
is consistent with atopic asthma and the individuals identified in cluster 1 and 2. Similar to
cluster 1, AP1 had preserved baseline pulmonary function parameters (FEV1 (% predicted):
102 vs. 90, and FEV1/FVC: 0.78 vs. 0.79, cluster 1 vs. AP1), whereas AP2 moderately reduced
pulmonary function baseline more comparable to cluster 2 (FEV1 (% predicted): 82 vs. 76, and
FEV1/FVC: 0.74 vs. 0.73, cluster 2 vs. AP2). Importantly, this suggests a link between pulmo-
nary function and the immunology of the airway as we had defined these clusters based on
immunologic profiles. In asthmatics prior to treatment the immunologic profiles were highly
associated with the composition of the microbiota in airway. These data indicate that in atopic
asthmatics differences in pulmonary function may be mediated by unique immune responses
to the airway microbiome.
AP1 exhibited significantly decreased concentrations of cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-17F, and
G-CSF) associated with microbial pathogens [12, 18]. In contrast, AP2 had decreased concen-
trations of cytokines associated with reduced airway inflammation (IL-2 and IL-10) [9, 32, 33].
Additionally, AP2 exhibited higher concentrations of TNF-α and MIP-1β. Notably, the con-
centrations of IL-2 and IL-10 were independent of other cytokines. In contrast, TNF-α and

 MIP-1β were highly correlated with IL-1β, -8, -31, and -33, which we identified as Module 1.
MIP-1β was identified as a hub in Module 1. The pro-inflammatory Module 1 was associated
with a greater likelihood of airway obstruction, negatively correlating FEV1 (% predicted) and
FEV1/FVC. Importantly, IL-8, -31, and -33 have been shown to negatively correlate in inde-
pendent associations with FEV1 (% predicted) [34–36]. The abundance of Module 1 was
reduced by treatment with the inhaled corticosteroid, fluticasone propionate. Future

 investigations may identify specific cell populations secreting cytokines related to changes in
the microbiome.
The composition of the airway microbiome also significantly differed between asthmatic
phenotypes. AP2 was enriched with species from the upper airways, Actinomyces ondontolyti-
cus, Actinomyces oral taxon 180, Neisseria menigiditis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, whereas
AP1 was enriched with Enterococcus species. These species varied along the constructed eco-
logical gradient DCA1. Similar to previous reports, these data suggest that the lung micro-
biome can vary with regards to abundance of upper airway taxon [17, 18]. Interestingly,
asthmatic individuals may have impaired mucocilliary clearance upon allergen exposure and
therefore might have different rates of elimination of upper-airway species [37]. Unlike what
has been previously reported in non-asthmatic individuals, in asthmatics prior to FP treatment
the increasing abundance of these upper airway species was not associated with Th17
responses but was highly associated with decreasing IL-2 and increasing Module 1.
Interestingly, the abundance of Streptococcus pneumoniae was reduced after FP treatment
which correlated with the reduction in concentration of Module 1 (IL-1β, -8, -31, -33, TNF-α
and MIP-1β). Previously, the abundance of Streptococcus in sputum has been shown to posi-
tively correlate with IL-8 and neutrophils [35]. Actinomyces and Neisseria species have been
shown to be enriched in asthmatics but also increased in abundance with lower BAL eosino-
phils [20]. In our study, DCA1 represented an increasing gradient of Actinomyces ondontolyti-
cus, Actinomyces oral taxon 180, Neisseria menigiditis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. DCA1
had unique associations with IL-2 and Module 1 in asthmatics prior to FP treatment. In
murine infection models, Streptococcus pneumoniae induces increased production of many of
the cytokines in Module 1 [38].
Our study, though limited in sample size and racial diversity, highlights the heterogeneous
nature of asthma. Even within asthmatics that fit the picture of atopic asthma, there appears to
significant variation within local inflammation and the lower airway microbiome, thus allow-
ing us to discern two distinct phenotypes. Our observation may have been strengthened by the
strong exclusion criteria: no history of smoking in the past year, less than a five pack year his-
tory of smoking, and no symptoms of respiratory infection in the proceeding 6 weeks.
Although the inclusion and exclusion criteria control for several potential confounders, the
small sample size of this study limits the data to be less generalizable to all asthmatics and
effects covariates associated with disease severity might be missed, such as BMI which made
up 50% of AP1 subjects. In addition to larger sample sizes, future investigations of smokers
and those after an infection or asthma exacerbation would be of interest to test for subtypes
similar to AP1 and AP2.
In addition to small sample size, our analysis did not include assessment of BAL cellular
profiles (e.g. % of eosinophils in BAL) nor did it include a placebo arm for treatment compari-
son. It should be noted that BAL cellular profile are associated with differences in the airway
microbiome [39, 40]. Notably, in these studies the taxa Streptoccocus, Neisseria, Actinomyces,
and Rothia were identified as differentially abundant between asthmatics with different granu-
locytic profiles. The lack of placebo arm reduces conclusions that can be drawn after steroid
treatment, as it is not known whether the changes in the microbiome or inflammation are due
to random temporal exposures to bacteria. Due to clinical limitations of obtaining serial sam-
ples from the same individuals, this area of literature is lacking. The association between the
exposure to different microbiota and the detected inflammation was not significant after treat-
ment (Table 3). These data suggest that even if the bacterial variation is due random temporal
variation, ICS therapy may reduce the inflammation associated with exposure to specific bacte-
rial species, such as those from the oral cavity.

 Currently, more personalized approaches are being developed for treatment of the most
severe forms of asthma. Our study indicates that even in mild to moderate asthmatics with
intermittent or persistent symptom there are distinct sub-phenotypes (AP1 and AP2) that dif-
fer in their immune response and microbiome. These sub-phenotypes are associated with
important aspects of airway physiology. Additionally, monitoring for microbiological changes,
such as an abundance of Streptococcus pneumoniae and oral-pharyngeal taxa, may allow for
personalized approaches for patient monitoring.
