Introduction: Data suggest dietary modification can improve clinical responses in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The goal of this study was to
determine the efficacy of an autoimmune protocol diet in patients with Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis.
Methods: We enrolled adults with active IBD (Harvey–Bradshaw index $ 5 or partial Mayo score $3 and erosions on endoscopy and/or elevated fecal
calprotectin). For the autoimmune protocol, patients underwent 6-week elimination followed by 5-week maintenance phase. Clinical indices, laborato-
ries, and biomarkers were assessed at baseline and weeks 6 and 11. Endoscopy was performed at study completion.
Results: The final cohort included 15 patients with IBD, with mean disease duration 19 years (SD 14.6) and active biological use in 7 (47%) patients.
Nutrient repletion was initiated for deficiencies in vitamin D (n ¼ 3) and iron (n ¼ 6). From week 0 to weeks 6 and 11, mean partial Mayo score
significantly improved from 5.8 (SD 1.2) to 1.2 (SD 2.0) and 1.0 (SD 2.0) for ulcerative colitis, and mean Harvey–Bradshaw index significantly improved
from 7 (SD 1.5) to 3.6 (SD 2.1) and 3.4 (SD 2.6) for Crohn’s disease. C-reactive protein did not significantly change during study. Mean fecal cal-
protectin improved from 471 (SD 562) to 112 (SD 104) at week 11 (P ¼ 0.12). Among those with follow-up endoscopy at week 11 (n ¼ 7),
improvements were noted in simple endoscopic score for Crohn’s disease (n ¼ 1), Rutgeerts score (n ¼ 1), and Mayo endoscopy subscore (n ¼ 4).
Discussion: Dietary elimination can improve symptoms and endoscopic inflammation in patients with IBD. Randomized controlled trials are warranted.

I
nflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), which include both Crohn’s
disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are complex gastroin-
testinal disorders that arise in a genetically susceptible host due to
factors involving T-cell dysregulation, gut dysbiosis, environmental
exposures, and dietary factors. More than 200 genes have been
identified that may increase the risk of IBD, but account for only
a modest proportion of the disease variance (;13% for CD, ;7%
for UC).1,2 Therefore, IBD is considered a complex polygenic
disease that is strongly influenced by environmental factors.
Among these, diet and the gut microbiome, 2 related environmental
factors, are hypothesized to be particularly important risk factors
and can be modified to influence disease risk and course.3
Despite diet being implicated in the pathogenesis of IBD,4
we have limited data to guide the use of nutritional therapy as either
primary or adjunctive treatment for these conditions. Conventional
medical therapy for IBD focuses on suppression of the immune
system by targeting a variety of pathways, yet response rates con-
tinue to remain suboptimal. Therefore, there is an important need to
study dietary factors that may not only help improve response to
conventional treatment but also potentially be used as primary
therapy or maintenance therapy for patients with IBD. A Western
diet, high in refined carbohydrates, omega-6 fatty acids, saturated
fat, low in fiber, vitamins, and generally nutrient dense foods, are
associated with an increased risk of IBD.4 Recent albeit limited data

 suggest that a semivegetarian diet5 (allowing milk and eggs, fish
once per week, and other meat once every 2 weeks), specific car-
bohydrate diet6–8 (removal of all grains, most dairy products, and
sweeteners except for honey), or anti-inflammatory diet9 (modified
carbohydrate and fatty acid intake, and increased prebiotic/probiotic
ingestion) can be associated with improved rates of achieving or
maintaining clinical response.
The autoimmune protocol (AIP) diet is an extension of the
Paleolithic diet10 and incorporates some of the dietary changes
previously studied in IBD, including avoidance of gluten and
refined sugar. The AIP diet focuses on an initial elimination phase
of food groups including grains, legumes, nightshades, dairy, eggs,
coffee, alcohol, nuts and seeds, refined/processed sugars, oils, and
food additives.10,11 The rationale is to avoid foods, additives, or
medications (e.g., nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) that can
trigger intestinal inflammation, dysbiosis, and/or symptomatic food
intolerance.10,12–14 It also emphasizes consumption and preparation
of fresh, nutrient dense foods, bone broth, and fermented foods,
while addressing factors that are known to associate with disability
due to IBD, such as sleep and sleep hygiene, stress management,
forming a support system, and physical activity.15 The elimination
phase is followed by a maintenance phase, the duration of which
can vary by individual, until they achieve a measurable improve-
ment in their symptoms and overall well-being. Staged reintroduc-
tion of food groups is then initiated gradually, as patients identify
unique foods or food groups that may contribute to symptoms
while liberalizing their diet.10,11
Based on increasing evidence suggesting an impact of diet on
clinical disease activity and IBD, and our clinical experience with
patients pursuing the AIP diet for their symptomatic IBD, we
performed a prospective study to evaluate the potential efficacy of the
autoimmune protocol (AIP) diet in patients with active CD and UC.
METHODS
We conducted a single-center, open-labeled uncontrolled
study designed to determine potential efficacy of an AIP diet in
patients with active CD and UC. Eligible patients were enrolled
through the Scripps Clinic Medical Group Division of Gastroenter-
ology (La Jolla, CA). Study participants provided written informed
consent under a protocol approved by the Institutional Review
Board of Scripps. Eligible patients included adults ages 18 and over
with either symptomatic CD (defined as Harvey–Bradshaw index
[HBI] $ 5) or UC (partial Mayo clinic score $3). Objective evi-
dence of active disease was also required for study inclusion either
by endoscopy (colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy) or imaging
(video capsule endoscopy or enterography) within 7 months of
enrollment, or elevated calprotectin (.50 mg/g) within 1 month of
enrollment. Additional inclusion criteria included an established
Facebook account and being comfortable with the use of internet-
based surveys and email. Exclusion criteria included pregnant or
breast-feeding women, patients with known celiac disease or history
of positive TTG antibody, evidence of untreated infection (e.g.,
Clostridium difficile), presence of stoma or J pouch, bowel surgery
within 12 weeks before enrollment or deemed likely during study
period, use of tube or enteral feeding, elemental diet, or parenteral
alimentation within 4 weeks of study initiation. Dosage of medica-
tions being used to treat IBD before enrollment was advised to
remain stable during the study period with the exception of tapering
of corticosteroids. As a pilot study examining efficacy of the AIP
diet in active IBD, no minimum duration of medication use was
required before study enrollment.
Dietary Intervention
The AIP dietary intervention consisted of a 6-week
elimination phase (staged elimination of grains, legumes, night-
shades, dairy, eggs, coffee, alcohol, nuts and seeds, refined/
processed sugars, oils, and food additives) followed by a 5-week
maintenance phase (during which no food group reintroduction
was allowed), using the “SAD to AIP in 6” diet transition pro-
gram.16 All participants began the study on September 5, 2016,
and completed the study on November 18, 2016. As an initial
pilot study of the AIP diet for active IBD, we did not formally
examine reintroduction of food groups after the maintenance
phase. The study incorporated a certified health coach, who con-
ducted the dietary intervention, and a registered dietician to pro-
vide one-to-one feedback to participants. The program also
counseled participants on forming a support system, grocery
shopping and food preparation, sleep and sleep hygiene, educa-
tion regarding nutrient density and fermented foods, stress man-
agement, incorporation of bone broth and physical activity, and
avoidance of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Health and
group-based coaching and dietary counseling were provided
through individual email and a private Facebook group accessible
by invited members only. Because participants began the study at
the same time, they could communicate with one another through
the Facebook group, but study investigators and staff were not
part of this group. During the study, participants were asked to
record dietary intake, which was communicated through email
and reviewed by the health coach and dietician. Participants also
completed quality of life assessment during the study using the
Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (SIBDQ).
Before the study, participants received 2 books on AIP diet
and recipes: “The Paleo Approach: Reverse Autoimmune Disease
and Heal Your Body” by Ballantyne, published 2014 and “The
Autoimmune Paleo Cookbook: An Allergen-Free Approach to
Managing Chronic Illness” by Trescott, published 2014.
Office visits (at baseline before study start, and end of
study) and laboratories (baseline, week 6, and week 11) were
conducted at Scripps Clinic. Endoscopy, radiology, and/or bio-
marker assessment were performed at baseline and at study
completion to assess for mucosal healing. At the end of the study,
participants were provided guidance on any continuation of
maintenance phase and staged reintroduction of food groups.
Outcome Measures
The goal of this study was to evaluate the potential efficacy
of the AIP diet on for patients with active CD and UC. The

 primary outcome was to examine the proportion of patients
achieving clinical remission for CD and UC at study completion
(11 weeks). Clinical remission was defined as HBI , 5 for CD
and partial Mayo score (sum of individual scores for stool fre-
quency, rectal bleeding, and physician global assessment) #2 for
UC.17 Secondary measures included achievement of clinical out-
come measures at week 6 (end of elimination phase), changes in
biomarkers and endoscopic disease activity from baseline to
weeks 6 and 11, changes in steroid use (among those with active
use at baseline), and examination of any adverse events during the
follow-up period. Analyses of clinical outcomes were performed
for those patients with follow-up data at both weeks 6 and 11,
whereas analyses of biomarker (C-reactive protein [CRP] or fecal
calprotectin [FC]) were performed for those with follow-up data at
weeks 6 and/or 11. Only 1 patient with CD was lost to follow-up
during the study before assessments were made at week 6 or 11.
Secondary analyses of clinical outcomes carrying forward this
patient’s baseline data were conducted to minimize bias due to
loss of follow-up (see “Results”).
Statistical Analysis
Analyses were conducted for participants with CD or UC and
for the entire cohort. Paired t test was used to examine differences
between baseline and week 6 or 11 outcomes among those with
follow-up data at those time points. Fisher’s exact test was used to
examine whether IBD type was associated with the primary outcome.
RESULTS
We enrolled 18 adult patients. Three patients withdrew before
study start because of inability to commit to dietary change. The final
cohort included 9 participants with CD and 6 with UC (Table 1).
Among the 9 patients with CD, 5 (56%) had postoperative recurrence
of CD (3 ileal and 2 ileocolonic). Before study start, 8 of the 9
participants with CD had active disease on endoscopic evaluation
(with visible erosions or ulcers in diseased regions), 5 of whom had
elevated FC (.50 mg/g). One participant with Crohn’s enrolled in
the setting of only an elevated FC (79 mg/g), with colonoscopy
within 1 month of study showing no active erosion or ulceration.
At baseline, CRP was elevated (.10 mg/L) in 33% participants (5/
15), with mean CRP 7.3 (SD 10.7) and mean FC was 392 mg/g (SD
448 mg/g) (Table 1). All 6 participants with UC had active disease on
baseline endoscopy, with Mayo endoscopic subscores (MESs) of 1
(n ¼ 3), 2 (n ¼ 2), and 3 (n ¼ 1). Five of the 6 patients with UC had
elevated FC at baseline (mean 447 mg/g, SD 426 mg/g).
Mean IBD duration was 19 years (SD 14.6) and active
biological use in 7 participants (Table 1). Types of therapy among
those with active biological use (n ¼ 7) included infliximab
monotherapy (n ¼ 2), adalimumab monotherapy (n ¼ 2), vedoli-
zumab monotherapy (n ¼ 1), and vedolizumab combination ther-
apy with thiopurine (n ¼ 1) or methotrexate (n ¼ 1). Mean
duration of biological use before study was 1.8 years (SD 2.5).
Two patients started infliximab or vedolizumab within 3 months
of study start; 1 patient with severe UC initiated infliximab mono-
therapy 20 days before study start and 1 patient with ileocolonic
CD with postoperative recurrence and anastomotic stricture on
oral methotrexate initiated vedolizumab therapy (in addition to
methotrexate) 75 days before study start. Excluding these 2 pa-
tients, mean duration of biological use before study start was 2.5
years (SD 2.7). Nutrient repletion was initiated for deficiencies in
vitamin D (n ¼ 3) and iron (n ¼ 6).

 Outcome Measures
Clinical remission was achieved at week 6 by 11/15 (73%)
study participants (6 CD and 5 UC), and all 11 maintained clinical
remission during the maintenance phase of the study. Mean total
SIBDQ scores significantly improved from 46.5 (SD 12.5) at
baseline to 53.3 (SD 10.9) at week 6 (P ¼ 0.017) and 60.5
(SD 4.8) at week 11 (P ¼ 0.045). One patient with postoperative
recurrence of ileal CD (without stricture) continued to have mild-
moderately active CD (HBI range, 7–11) throughout the study,
although noted resolution of joint pains. Two other patients with
CD were either lost to follow-up or withdrew from the study
before week 6 (see “Adverse Events”). One patient with left-
sided UC continued to have mildly active symptoms (partial
Mayo score remained at 5).
Among participants with UC with complete follow-up data
at weeks 6 and 11 (n ¼ 6), from week 0 to 6, mean partial Mayo
score improved from 5.8 (SD 1.2) to 1.2 (SD 2.0) (P , 0.01), and
this was sustained through week 11 (partial Mayo score 1.0, SD
2.0, P value for comparison between week 11 and 0 was ,0.01)
(Table 2).
Among participants with CD with complete follow-up data
at weeks 6 and 11 (n ¼ 7), mean HBI score improved from 7 (SD
1.5) to 3.6 (SD 2.1) (P , 0.01) at week 6, and at week 11 was
3.4 (SD 2.6) (P value for comparison between week 11 and
0 was ,0.01). The 1 participant with a baseline FC of 79 mg/g
and normal colonoscopy had a baseline HBI of 7 that improved to
2 by week 6 and remained at 2 at week 11. Sensitivity analyses
excluding this patient, and thus only including patients with CD
with active erosion or ulceration on endoscopy or imaging, did
not alter the primary results: mean HBI score improved from 6.7
(SD 1.6) to 3.5 (SD 1.9) (P , 0.01) at week 6 and to 3.7 (SD 2.7)
(P ¼ 0.01) at week 11.
Achievement of clinical remission did not differ signifi-
cantly between CD and UC (pexact ¼ 0.60). Secondary analyses
conducted including the 1 participant with CD who was lost to
follow-up did not alter the primary results. Mean HBI score
improved from 7 (SD 1.6) to 4 (SD 2.6) (P , 0.01) at week 6
and at week 11 was 4.1 (SD 3.1) (P , 0.01).
Sensitivity analyses excluding the 2 participants (1 with CD
and 1 with UC) initiating biological therapy within 3 months of study
start did not alter the primary outcome results. Excluding these
patients, mean HBI improved from 6.7 (SD 1.5) to 3.3 (SD 1.8) (P ,
0.01) at week 6 and at week 11 was 3.4 (SD 2.6) (P , 0.01). Mean
partial Mayo score improved from 5.4 (SD 0.5) to 1.4 (SD 2.2) (P ¼
0.02) at week 6 and at week 11 was 1.2 (SD 2.2) (P ¼ 0.02).
Among those with laboratories completed at baseline and
week 6 or week 11, mean CRP and FC decreased, but the
results were not statistically significant (Table 3). Among those
with a baseline FC .50 mg/g, mean FC decreased from 701
(SD 563) to 139 (SD 113) (P ¼ 0.09). Among the 11 participants
achieving clinical remission, 6 participants provided stool samples
at baseline and week 11, with mean FC decreasing from 471 (SD
562) to 111 (SD 104), although not statistically significant (P ¼
0.12). No statistically significant differences were observed for
hemoglobin, hematocrit, albumin, transaminases, bilirubin, creat-
inine, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, triglycerides, or
low-density lipoprotein between week 0 and 6 or 11. There was
no significant change in patient weight from baseline to study
completion (P ¼ 0.30).
Among those with follow-up endoscopy at week 11 (n ¼
7), improvements were noted in simple endoscopic score for
Crohn’s disease (n ¼ 1, rectum 8, left colon 5 / rectum 4, left
colon 0), Rutgeerts score (n ¼ 1, i3 / i1, this patient did not
achieve clinical remission by HBI at week 6 or 11), and Mayo
endoscopy subscore (n ¼ 4). Specifically, among those with UC,
MES improved by 1 point in 3 participants (MES 2 / 1 [n ¼ 1]
or 1 / 0 [n ¼ 2]), 3 points in 1 participant (MES 3 / 0), and no
change in 1 participant (MES 1). Among participants with IBD
achieving mucosal improvement, mean FC improved from 390
(SD 4812) at baseline to 110 (SD 94) at week 11 (P ¼ 0.26), and
mean CRP improved from 4.6 (SD 5.2) at baseline to 2.8 (SD 6.3)
at week 11 (P ¼ 0.60).

 Although we advised no medication change before study
start, 1 participant discontinued oral mesalamine therapy but
achieved clinical remission by week 6 (partial Mayo clinic score
decreased from 6 at baseline to 0 at week 6). Another participant
self-discontinued oral mesalamine but continued mesalamine
suppository, and also noted a decrease in partial Mayo score
from 5 to 0 by week 6. Two of the 3 participants were able to
discontinue steroid therapy (in both, partial Mayo clinic score
decreased to 0 by week 6). One patient on systemic steroids was
lost to follow-up because of insurance change (see “Adverse
events”).
Adverse Events
One participant with postoperative recurrence of ileal CD
with known ileocolonic anastomotic stricture required hospitali-
zation for partial small bowel obstruction approximately 3 weeks
after study start. This was attributed to a significant increase in
raw vegetables, salad, and meat consumption. This participant did
not communicate with health coach or dietician regarding dietary
changes in the setting of known stricture. Participant’s symptoms
resolved overnight with the use of intravenous steroids, and
patient was discharged on rapid steroid taper. This patient was
subsequently lost to follow-up, and we were unable to make
assessments at week 6 or 11.
Another participant with ileal CD with ileocecal valve
stricture withdrew before the end of elimination phase because of
worsening symptoms. Week 6 assessment was not made. Notably,
this participant experienced increase in biomarkers from week
0 to 6, with FC increasing from 449 to 758 mg/g, and CRP
increasing from 36 to 41.2 mg/L.
Although there were no significant differences in lipid
subtypes between weeks 0 and 6 or weeks 0 and 11, some
participants did experience small rises in triglycerides or low-
density lipoprotein that prompted dietary modification by the
registered dietician and health coach.
DISCUSSION
Increasing evidence suggests that dietary modification can
modulate inflammation and improve clinical responses in IBD.
Our prospective observational study indicate that an AIP diet,
involving an elimination phase followed by a maintenance phase,
demonstrates preliminary efficacy in patients with active IBD. We
also identified improvements in FC along with endoscopic
improvements in the mucosal appearance in most patients
undergoing follow-up endoscopy.
Our results support the use of dietary modification as an
adjunct to IBD therapy. Clinical remission was achieved by week
6 by 11/15 (73%) of study participants, and all 11 maintained
clinical remission during the maintenance phase of the study. We
did not hypothesize, a priori, that clinical remission would be
achieved so early (week 6). Indeed, this proportion of participants
with active IBD (HBI $ 5 or partial Mayo clinic score $3, and
objective evidence of active inflammation) achieving clinical
remission by week 6 rivals that of most drug therapies for IBD;
importantly, our dietary study was performed as an adjunct to
medical therapy, and almost 50% of patients in our study were
on biological therapy. Therefore, our results suggest that dietary
modification can be used as an adjunct to conventional IBD ther-
apy, even among those with moderate-to-severe disease.
Importantly, the 2 participants with CD with ileal strictures
(native or anastomotic) developed either worsening disease
activity or partial small bowel obstruction. Therefore, although
dietary elimination can be helpful, consideration should be given
to anatomical variation and requires counseling and close
follow-up.
The premise of the AIP diet, as a whole, involves a staged
elimination of food groups that may be associated with immune
stimulation and intolerance, maintenance of the eliminated foods,
followed by staged reintroduction of certain foods or food groups
over time. The purpose of our study was to examine the potential
efficacy of the AIP diet for IBD, and as such we focused on the
elimination phase and a minimum 1-month maintenance phase.
Our study design was adapted from our health coach’s online
program, which focuses on the 6-week elimination phase.16 The
maintenance phase, in practice, can occur for participants any-
where from 30 to 90 days, although some continue it even longer,
before starting to reintroduce food groups. The protocol empha-
sizes healthy food behaviors aimed at increasing the nutrient den-
sity of the diet, incorporating fresh fruits and vegetables, healthy
sources of fats, lean proteins, fermented foods, and, for our study,
modifying intake according to IBD phenotype (e.g., strictures).
The protocol also recommends avoiding nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs and low–nutrient-density processed foods,
which may also contain emulsifiers or additives that can perpet-
uate inflammation, while improving lifestyle behaviors including
sleep and sleep hygiene, stress management, and physical activity.
Given the associations of stress with IBD flare18 and low physical
activity or nighttime sleep with risk of IBD,19,20 addressing these

 As such, it was not possible to determine how much the apparent
effectiveness of the dietary/lifestyle intervention was due to these
nondietary aspects.
An important goal of therapies for IBD is to reduce
inflammation. Although not statistically significant, we did note
decreases in FC, particularly in the patients with UC. Further-
more, rectal bleeding was significantly reduced by week 6 and 11
among patients with UC. The baseline CRP was also within
normal limits (,10 mg/L) in most (66%) participants, and no
statistically significant differences were noted between baseline
and follow-up CRP measurements. Among those with endoscopic
improvements in mucosal inflammation, we noted decreases in
FC, consistent with studies demonstrating better correlation of
mucosal findings with FC than clinical symptoms or indices.21
Our study, although small, suggests dietary modification has the
potential to reduce inflammation, as measured by FC and
endoscopy.
The strengths of our study include a prospective design and
focus on patients with not only clinically active IBD but also
objective evidence of inflammation. Nutrient repletion was also
initiated for patients with baseline deficiencies in vitamin D or iron,
which would have helped to reduce confounding influences of
micronutrient depletion on disease activity, but whose repletion may
have also impacted improvements in general well-being noted during
the study. Through our novel study design incorporating social
media, study participants also had a unique ability to communicate
with one another and our health coach and dietician, through a secret
and private Facebook group. Poststudy follow-up visits suggest that
online engagement, sharing of similar experiences and recipes, and
convenience of communicating with health professionals directly
were viewed favorably by participants.
Limitations of the study include small size, lack of
a randomized trial design involving a control group, lack of
blinding, and potential for selection bias among those enrolling in
the study. We included 1 participant with active CD by HBI and
FC, with no objective evidence of active inflammation by
colonoscopy. However, analyses excluding this patient did not
alter the primary outcome, and indicated significant improvement in
HBI among patients with CD. Two patients in our study (1 CD and
1 UC) had initiated biological therapy within 3 months of study
start, which could potentially confound the results of our study.
However, secondary analyses excluding these 2 patients also did
not alter the primary outcome results for CD or UC. Although
endoscopic improvement was noted in 6 of the 7 participants
completing endoscopic reassessment at study completion, it is
important to acknowledge that 8 participants did not pursue
endoscopic reassessment, and as such we could not perform
statistical analysis to examine effect of the dietary intervention on
mucosal healing. Another limitation includes lack of detailed
assessment of the impact other recommendations such as physical
activity, sleep and sleep hygiene, social support, and stress
management had on their clinical course.
In conclusion, our study demonstrates that dietary
modification
focused
on
elimination
of
potentially
immunogenic or intolerant food groups has the potential to
improve symptoms and endoscopic inflammation in patients
with IBD. Dietary change can be an important adjunct to IBD
therapy not only to achieve remission but perhaps improve the
durability of response and remission. Perhaps for a subset of
patients, dietary and lifestyle modification alone may be
sufficient to control underlying luminal inflammation. Patients
wishing to incorporate dietary therapy should be counseled on
options assessed for micronutrient deficiencies and monitored
routinely.
Integrating
and
coordinating
care
with
health
coaches and registered dieticians can allow for effective
education and implementation of dietary modification over
time, in accordance with unique patient goals as well.
Larger randomized trials are needed to validate these findings
and
examine
the
long-term
course
of
patients
during
reintroduction.
