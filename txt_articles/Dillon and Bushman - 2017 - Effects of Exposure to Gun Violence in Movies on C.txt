 Effects of Exposure to Gun Violence in Movies
on Children’s Interest in Real Guns
Kelly P. Dillon, PhD; Brad J. Bushman, PhD
IMPORTANCE More US children die by accidental gun use than children in other developed
countries. One factor that can influence children’
s interest in guns is exposure to media
containing guns.
OBJECTIVE To test whether children who see a movie containing guns will handle a real gun
longer and will pull the trigger more times than children who see the same movie not
containing guns.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS One hundred four children aged 8 to 12 years recruited
through advertisements were randomly assigned in pairs to watch a 20-minute PG-rated
movie containing or not containing guns in a university laboratory. Children then played with
toys and games in a room for 20 minutes while being video recorded. A cabinet in the room
contained a real (disabled) gun with a sensor counting trigger pulls. Recordings were coded
for the time spent holding the gun and in aggressive play. Data were collected from July 15,
2015, through January 1, 2016, and analyzed using generalized estimating equations (Tweedie
log-link for time spent holding the gun; Poisson log-link for pulling the trigger).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The 2 main outcomes were time spent holding the gun and
the number of trigger pulls. Control variables included sex, age, trait aggressiveness,
exposure to violent media, interest in guns, and number of guns at home.
RESULTS Among the 104 study participants (62 boys [59.6%] and 42 girls [40.4%]; mean
(SD) age, 9.9 [1.5] years), the adjusted median number of trigger pulls among children who
saw the movie containing guns was 2.8 (interquartile range [IQR], 0.2-2.8) compared with
0.01 (IQR, 0.01-0.2) among children who saw the movie not containing guns (adjusted odds
ratio, 22.3; 95% CI, 6.0-83.4; P < .001). The adjusted median number of seconds spent
holding the gun among children who saw a movie containing guns was 53.1 (IQR, 35.5-53.1)
compared with 11.1 (IQR, 10.7-16.7) among children who saw the movie not containing guns
(adjusted odds ratio, 3.0; 95% CI, 0.9-9.9; P = .07). Qualitative analyses on 4 pairs from each
condition found that children who saw the movie containing guns also played more
aggressively and sometimes fired the gun at people (ie, self, partner, or passersby on street).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Children in the United States frequently have access to
unsecured firearms and frequently consume media containing guns. This experiment shows
that children who see movie characters use guns are more likely to use guns themselves.

early 60% of US households with guns do not secure
them.1 If children find these guns, the consequences
can be deadly. Most unintentional gun shootings hap-
pen at home, typically as a result of children playing with a
loaded, unlocked gun.2 Children in the United States are 10
times more likely to die by unintentional gun shootings than
children from other developed countries.3
Many factors can influence children’
s interest in guns. Pre-
vious research has shown that children exposed to movie char-
acters who smoke are more likely to smoke4 and that chil-
dren exposed to movie characters who drink alcohol are more
likely to drink alcohol.5 This experiment focuses on exposure
to movie characters with guns. We hypothesized that chil-
dren exposed to movie characters who use guns will be more
likely to use guns.
Gun violence in movies is increasing, especially in mov-
ies that target younger viewers. An analysis of top-selling films
found that the depiction of guns in violent scenes in films rated
PG-13 (parental guidance suggested for viewers younger than
13 years) has more than doubled since 1985 when the rating
was introduced, increasing from the rating levels of G (gen-
eral audience) and PG (parental guidance suggested) films to
the rating level of R films (for viewers aged ≥17) by 2005.6 A
follow-upstudyfoundthattheamountofgunviolenceinPG-13
films continued to increase through 2015.7
Thisexperimentteststhehypothesisthatchildrenwhosee
movie characters use guns are more likely to use a real gun.
Specifically, we hypothesized that children aged 8 to 12 years
who see movie scenes containing guns will hold a real gun
longer and will pull the trigger more times compared with chil-
dren who see the same movie scenes not containing guns.
Methods
Participants
Participants included 104 children in 52 pairs aged 8 to 12
years (Table 1). To be included in the experiment, the partici-
pant was required to bring another child aged 8 to 12 years
(ie, sibling, step-sibling, cousin, or friend). Participants were
recruited using advertisements in university employee news-
letters, community websites, public spaces, and through
ResearchMatch.org, a national registry for research studies.8
Each participant was compensated $25 for the hour that they
spent in the laboratory. All methods, measures, and materials
were approved by the institutional review board of The Ohio
State University, Columbus. Parents were made aware of the
true purpose of the experiment before giving written
informed consent (rate, 100%); children also provided assent
(rate, 100%). We did not prospectively register this random-
ized trial because there was no institutional requirement to
register it as a randomized clinical trial prior to publication,
but we have now done so at the request of the journal. The
trial protocol is available in the Supplement.
Procedure
Study data were collected from July 15, 2015, through Janu-
ary 1, 2016. Participants were told: “This study is about what
kids like to do in their spare time, such as watching movies,
and playing with toys and games.” Before viewing the movie,
participants completed a 9-item measure of how often they
engaged in aggressive behaviors such as yelling, arguing,
kicking, and hitting (0 indicates never; 1, sometimes; and
2, often; Cronbach α = .76).9,10 They also completed a 15-item
measure of their attitudes toward guns (eg, “Carrying a gun
makes people feel safe,
” “I wish everyone would get rid of their
guns[reversescored],
”where0indicatesstronglydisagreeand
4, strongly agree; Cronbach α = .80).11,12 Next, participants
listed their 3 favorite movies, television shows, and video
games and indicated how often they watched or played them
each week (1 indicates only once in a while; 2, a lot but not
always; and 3, many times). Ratings on each media were stan-
dardized using the Motion Picture Association of America film
ratings system13 for movies, Common Sense Media14 for tele-
vision shows, and Entertainment Software Rating Board15 for
video games, in which lower numbers indicated more permis-
sive ratings (eg, 1 for video games rated E for everyone) and
higher numbers indicated more violent content (eg, 4 for
video games rated M for mature players aged ≥17 years). We
multiplied the frequency of engagement with media rating
and then calculated the mean values for the 3 platforms
(Cronbach α = .71).
Next, each pair was randomly assigned (using a random
number generator before arrival) to watch a 20-minute
edited version of a PG-rated film (The Rocketeer [1991] or
National Treasure [2004]) containing or not containing guns
on a 99-cm (39-in) screen. The gun version contained por-
tions of the film as they were distributed. Scenes showing guns
were edited out for the no-gun version, but the action and nar-
rative of the film was not altered. Two different movies were
used to increase the generalizability of findings. After watch-
ing the film clip, participants indicated whether they had seen
it before (no or yes) and rated how exciting, boring, fun, and
violent it was; how much they liked it; whether they felt like
they were part of the action; and whether they wanted to see
therestofthemovie(0indicatesnotatall;4,verymuch).While
thechildrenwatchedthemovie,parentscompletedaformwith
demographic information (eg, race, sex, and age), their child’
s
presumed interest in guns (0 indicates not at all interested; 4,
very interested), and how many firearms were in their home.
Key Points
Question What are the immediate effects of exposure to movie
characters with guns on children’
s unsupervised play with guns?
Findings This randomized experiment included 104 children aged
8 to 12 years who were tested in pairs. Children who viewed a
PG-rated movie containing guns played with a real gun longer and
pulled the trigger more times than did children who viewed the
same movie not containing guns.
Meaning The connection shown in this experiment is a
compelling start to a broader conversation on the various factors
that can increase a child’
s interest in guns and violence, including
gun violence in movies.

 Next, participants went to a different room with a cabinet
containing toys (eg, Lego bricks [The Lego Group], Nerf guns
[Hasbro]) and games (eg, checkers). They were told they could
play with any of the toys and games in the room. One of the
cabinet drawers contained a real semiautomatic 9-mm hand-
gun that was modified so that it could not fire. The gun’
s ham-
mer and trigger were still functional to allow an individual to
pull the trigger, but no other components of the gun were func-
tional.Themagazineheldtheinfraredwiringtocountthenum-
ber of times the trigger was pulled with sufficient force to dis-
charge the gun. The gun looked and felt as it would normally.
Parents were informed about the gun before giving their con-
sent. The campus police chief examined and gave written ap-
proval for the modified gun to be used.
Participants were given 20 minutes to play in the room to-
gether with the door closed. Their parents and the experi-
menter secretly watched the children from a separate room via
a hidden camera. A research assistant was always in the exte-
riorgreetingroomincasetheparticipantshadquestions.Ifpar-
ticipants opened the laboratory door and told the research as-
sistant about the gun or gave it to the research assistant, the
gun was removed and the children were permitted to con-
tinue playing. After the play period ended, participants were
thoroughly debriefed and given an opportunity to ask ques-
tions. Information for counseling resources and gun safety
training were made available to all participants and parents.
Statistical Analysis
Quantitative Analyses
A generalized estimating equation (GEE) with an exchange-
able correlation structure was used to contrast between movie
conditions, with pairs as units. A log-link model with Poisson
distribution was used to analyze the number of trigger pulls. A
log-link model with Tweedie distribution was used to analyze
time spent handling the gun (in seconds). The main indepen-
dent variable in each model was movie condition (guns vs no
guns). The first set of models included movie condition (guns
vsnoguns),movie(NationalTreasurevsTheRocketeer),andthe
participant’
s sex (male vs female). A second set of models in-
cludedmoviecondition,movie,sex,age,numberofgunsinthe
home, attitudes toward guns, trait aggressiveness, consump-
tion of violent media, and parental estimation of their child’
s
interestinthegun.AllanalyseswereperformedusingSPSSsoft-
ware (version 22; SPSS, Inc). P < .05 indicated significance.
Qualitative Analyses
Two trained research assistants blinded to movie condition
and hypotheses independently watched and transcribed vid-
eos of each play session and recorded type of play (ie,
aggressive, gentle, independent, together, or taking turns),
type of verbal communication (ie, swearing, compliment-
ing), any interpersonal aggression between participations
(ie, punching, wrestling, or shooting a Nerf gun at partner),
and pointing the real gun at self, partner, or others. One of us
(K.P.D.) conducted random quality assurance checks to con-
firm codings. From these recordings, 4 videotaped sessions
from each condition were randomly selected and interpreted
using grounded theory.16

 compared with 42 nonwhite participants (40.4%). Sixty-two
were boys (59.6%), and 42 were girls (40.4%).
Manipulation Checks
Random Assignment Check
Children randomly assigned to watch a movie clip containing
guns did not significantly differ from children randomly
assigned to watch a movie clip not containing guns in any
covariates (Table 1). The sex difference was significant (38 of
54 paticipants [70.4%] who watched movie clips containing
guns were boys compared with 24 of 50 [48.0%] who
watched movie clips not containing guns), but we random-
ized by pair rather than by sex. Sex was included as a covari-
ate in the analyses.
Movie Violence Manipulation Check
Asexpected,participantsratedthemovieclipscontainingguns
to be more violent than the movie clips not containing guns
(mean [SD], 2.76 [1.40] vs 1.69 [1.16]; P < .001). However, the
2 types of movie clips did not differ on the other rating
dimensions (Table 2).
Found Gun
Of the 52 pairs of participants, 43 pairs (82.7%) found the gun
in the cabinet drawer. Fourteen pairs (26.9%) gave the gun to
the research assistant or told him or her about it. In total, 22
pairs (42.3%) had 1 or both participants handle the gun. The
type of movie clip (ie, containing or not containing guns) did
not influence whether participants found the gun (40 of 54
[74.1%] vs 35 of 50 [70.0%]; P = .40) or handled it (17 of 54
[31.5%] vs 15 of 50 [30.0%]; P = .52).
Quantitative Analyses
Trigger Pulls
Ashypothesized,onaverage,participantswhosawmoviescon-
taining guns pulled the trigger more times than those who saw
the movie not containing guns. The adjusted median number
of trigger pulls among participants who saw a movie contain-
ing guns was 2.8 (interquartile range [IQR], 0.2-2.8) com-
pared with 0.01 (IQR, 0.01-0.2) among participants who saw
the movie not containing guns. In the GEE model using only
movie condition, movie, and sex as in the model, the ad-
justed odds ratio (AOR) was 17.1 (95% CI, 4.2-70.7; P < .001).
In the GEE model using all covariates, the AOR was 22.3
(95% CI, 6.0-83.4; P < .001).
Time Spent Holding Gun
As hypothesized, children who saw movies containing guns
held the gun longer when at play than children who saw mov-
ies not containing guns. The adjusted median number of sec-
onds spent with the gun among participants who saw a movie
containing guns was 53.1 (IQR, 35.5-53.1) compared with 11.1
(IQR, 10.7-16.7) who saw the movie not containing guns. This
difference was significant in the first model only. In the GEE
model using only movie condition, movie, and sex as risk fac-
tors,theAORwas3.2(95%CI,1.1-9.3;P = .03).IntheGEEmodel
using all covariates, the AOR was 3.0 (95% CI, 0.9-9.9; P = .07).
Covariates
When we kept condition and all other covariates equal, sex af-
fected trigger pulls but not the time spent with the gun. Being
male was associated with an increased number of trigger pulls
compared with being female (AOR, 19.8; 95% CI, 2.5-155.6;
P = .005). Sex was not associated with any differences in the
number of seconds spent handling the gun (AOR, 2.0; 95% CI,
0.6-6.6; P = .25). When we kept condition and all other covar-
iates equal, attitudes toward guns were found to influence trig-
ger pulls but not time spent with the gun. More positive atti-
tudes toward guns, as indicated by higher mean scores on the
Attitudes Toward Guns and Violence Questionnaire,11,12 was
associated with an increased number of trigger pulls (AOR, 3.6;
95% CI, 1.7-7.3; P = .001). Attitude toward guns was not asso-
ciated with time spent with the gun (AOR, 2.2; 95% CI, 0.8-
6.3; P = .15). None of the other covariates significantly influ-
enced trigger pulls (P > .67) or seconds spent handling the gun
(P > .13).
Qualitative Analyses
Pairs Who Saw a Movie Containing Guns
To provide a robust description of the data, qualitative analy-
ses were conducted on a random selection of 4 pairs who saw
a movie containing guns and 4 pairs who saw a movie not con-
taining guns. All of the randomly chosen pairs (pairs 49, 20, 1,
and 52) found the gun during the play session. Pair 49 found
the gun and immediately opened the door and gave it to the
research assistant. Afterward, the pair vocalized regret, wish-
ing they had kept the real gun to play with. They proceeded
to play violently, pretended their Nerf guns were M14s (semi-
automatic rifles), and talked about killing zombies and “blow-
ing heads off.” Pair 20 found the gun but did not touch it. This
pair opened the door and asked for permission to play with the
Nerf guns but did not mention the real gun. They played with
the Nerf guns for nearly the entire session.
The 2 remaining pairs chose to play with the gun. In pair
52, 1 child held the gun for 18 minutes of the 20-minute play
period and pulled the trigger 26 times. He also pulled the trig-
ger at the temple of his partner’
s head. For 1.5 of the remain-
ing minutes, he held the Nerf gun and shot 12 Nerf bullets at
his partner. His partner appeared to be disinterested in the real
gun and the Nerf gun, playing along with whatever the other

 child instructed. In pair 1, 1 boy pulled the trigger 35 times,
pointed the real gun out the laboratory window at people in the
street, threatened to hit his friend with the gun, and attempted
to steal toys and games from the play room. This pair also used
aggressivelanguage(eg,“Itoldyoudon’
tmesswithmeb—!”and
“Are you dumb as f—?!”) The other boy held the gun for 30 sec-
ondsandpulledthetrigger4times.For18oftheother18.5min-
utes, he held the Nerf gun and shot it 66 times at his partner.
Pairs Who Saw a Movie Not Containing Guns
Four randomly selected pairs in the no-gun condition (6, 24,
42, and 48) also underwent analysis. All but pair 48 found the
gun during the play session. Both children in pair 6 found the
real gun, but neither handled it nor told an adult about it. They
instead played with checkers and Legos for most of the play
session. Pair 24 found the gun shortly after the play session
began and later opened the drawer 4 more times to look at it.
Neither child touched the gun during the play session until one
handed it to the experimenter at the end the session. When
playing with the Nerf guns, this pair mainly fired at a pretend
target on the wall rather than at each other. When they did fire
the Nerf gun at each other, they avoided headshots and gave
each other time to reload. Pair 42 found the gun almost im-
mediately, and 1 child stated, “uh-uh, uh-uh, no, no, no” be-
fore taking the gun and opening the door to give it to the re-
search assistant. They played with the Nerf gun for nearly 14
minutes but mainly shot at a pretend target on the wall. Simi-
lar to pair 24, when they fired the Nerf gun at each other, they
avoided headshots and gave each other time to reload.

Thepresentresearchextendspreviousresearchbyshowingthat
children who see movie characters use guns are more likely to
use guns. The children in this experiment were randomly as-
signed to watch a 20-minute movie clip containing or not con-
taining guns and then were given the chance to play with the
sametoysinthesameroom,whichalsocontainedarealgunhid-
den in a drawer. Viewing a movie containing guns was associ-
ated with higher rates of trigger pulls, longer time handling the
gun, and playing more aggressively compared with viewing a

gest that exposure to gun violence in movies increases interest
in guns in the real world. Of note, the movies that we showed
children were age appropriate (rated PG) and not very graphic
intermsofgunviolence.Theeffectsmightbegreaterwithnewer
films containing more graphic gun violence.
Limitations
Like all studies, this study has limitations. Only 1 modified
handgun was available for the participants to find and with
which they could engage, but 2 Nerf guns were available. This
may have inadvertently invited coplay with Nerf guns but not
with the real handgun. Although the hidden camera could rec-
ord the entire room, it was stationary and unable to capture
all actions of all participants. Finally, most participants were
from suburban or urban neighborhoods, possibly limiting their
exposure to and training with firearms. Rural households tend
to have a greater likelihood of gun ownership,17 and exposure
and experience with firearms may negate the novelty of find-
ing a hidden gun, resulting in less curiosity and play. We also
did not ask parents or participants about previous gun safety
training, such as the National Rifle Association’
s Eddie Eagle
program. Although these programs have been found to be
helpful in teaching children to repeat verbal commands,18 they
havealsobeenfoundtoincreasethelikelihoodofchildrenhan-
dling found guns.19 Future research should take into account
previous experience and training as a covariate.
Additional research on this topic is necessary. Future re-
search could examine other types of media that contain guns,
such as video games. Future research in a more natural set-
ting (eg, a real home) would enhance the generalizability of
these findings. Longitudinal research with similar depen-
dent variables would allow researchers to examine the long-
term effects of exposure to gun violence in the media. Regard-
less of design, research on this topic could be life-saving.
Conclusions
Every day in the United States, nearly 40 children are shot.20
More than 1.7 million children live in a home with unsecured
guns. Nationwide campaigns by organizations such as Every-
town for Gun Safety21 and the National Rifle Association22 aim
toeducateparentsandhomeownersonresponsiblegunsafety.
OrganizationssuchastheMotionPictureAssociationofAmerica
and the Entertainment Software Rating Board provide infor-
mation to parents about media content using ratings. How-
ever,theseratingsareofteninaccurateforviolentcontent.23The
present experiment aimed to understand the connection be-
tweenexposuretogunviolenceinthemediaandinterestinand
playing with guns in the real world. We believe that these data
are a compelling start to the conversation on the various fac-
tors that can increase children’
s interest in guns and violence.
