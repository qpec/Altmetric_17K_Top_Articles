Key points
r Skeletal muscle hypertrophy is one of the main outcomes from resistance training (RT), but
how it is modulated throughout training is still unknown.
r We show that changes in myofibrillar protein synthesis (MyoPS) after an initial resistance
exercise (RE) bout in the first week of RT (T1) were greater than those seen post-RE at the
third (T2) and tenth week (T3) of RT, with values being similar at T2 and T3.
r Muscle damage (Z-band streaming) was the highest during post-RE recovery at T1, lower at
T2 and minimal at T3.
r When muscle damage was the highest, so was the integrated MyoPS (at T1), but neither
were related to hypertrophy; however, integrated MyoPS at T2 and T3 were correlated with
hypertrophy.
r We conclude that muscle hypertrophy is the result of accumulated intermittent increases in
MyoPS mainly after a progressive attenuation of muscle damage.
Abstract Skeletal muscle hypertrophy is one of the main outcomes of resistance training (RT),
but how hypertrophy is modulated and the mechanisms regulating it are still unknown. To
investigate how muscle hypertrophy is modulated through RT, we measured day-to-day integrated
myofibrillar protein synthesis (MyoPS) using deuterium oxide and assessed muscle damage at the
beginning (T1), at 3 weeks (T2) and at 10 weeks of RT (T3). Ten young men (27 (1) years, mean
(SEM)) had muscle biopsies (vastus lateralis) taken to measure integrated MyoPS and muscle
damage (Z-band streaming and indirect parameters) before, and 24 h and 48 h post resistance
exercise (post-RE) at T1, T2 and T3. Fibre cross-sectional area (fCSA) was evaluated using biopsies
at T1, T2 and T3. Increases in fCSA were observed only at T3 (P = 0.017). Changes in MyoPS
post-RE at T1, T2 and T3 were greater at T1 (P < 0.03) than at T2 and T3 (similar values between
T2 and T3). Muscle damage was the highest during post-RE recovery at T1, attenuated at T2
and further attenuated at T3. The change in MyoPS post-RE at both T2 and T3, but not at T1,
was strongly correlated (r � 0.9, P < 0.04) with muscle hypertrophy. Initial MyoPS response
post-RE in an RT programme is not directed to support muscle hypertrophy, coinciding with the
greatest muscle damage. However, integrated MyoPS is quickly ‘refined’ by 3 weeks of RT, and is
related to muscle hypertrophy. We conclude that muscle hypertrophy is the result of accumulated
intermittent changes in MyoPS post-RE in RT, which coincides with progressive attenuation of
muscle damage.

Introduction
Increases in skeletal muscle cross-sectional area (CSA)
(i.e. muscle hypertrophy) are a hallmark adaptation
of resistance training (RT). The processes modulating
muscle hypertrophy during RT are still surprisingly
obscure (Phillips, 2012; Schoenfeld, 2012; Damas et al.
2016a,b). RT-induced muscle hypertrophy is the result
of an accumulation of intermittent increases in myo-
fibrillar muscle protein synthesis (MyoPS) in response to
each resistance exercise (RE) bout (Moore et al. 2009b;
Brook et al. 2015). Indeed, we had previously reported
that acute increases in MyoPS aligned qualitatively
with hypertrophy-related chronic RT outcomes, such
as increases in muscle volume and muscle fibre CSA
(fCSA) (West et al. 2009, 2010; Burd et al. 2010; Mitchell
et al. 2012). Conversely, we (Mitchell et al. 2014) and
others (Mayhew et al. 2009) have reported that the
increases in protein synthesis after an initial RE bout,
measured by infusion trials over hours, did not align
with the eventual muscle hypertrophy after RT. The
reason for the incongruence between acute and chronic
hypertrophy-related responses is unknown, but could be
due to a physiological mechanism or a methodological
issue of evaluating protein synthesis over a short time
period (Mitchell et al. 2014).
Physiologically, unaccustomed RE results in muscle
damage
evidenced
directly
by
assessing
muscle
ultrastructure changes (e.g. Z-band streaming) (Gibala
et al. 1995; Stupka et al. 2001; Beaton et al. 2002b),
and indirectly by proxy indices (e.g. loss of muscle
strength, increases in muscle soreness (SOR) and creatine
kinase (CK) activity in the blood) (Clarkson et al. 1992;
Conceic
¸˜
ao et al. 2012; Nogueira et al. 2014). After the
initial muscle damage, growth mechanisms are triggered
(Vierck et al. 2000; McKay et al. 2008; Mackey et al. 2011)
producing an increase in protein synthesis to support, at
least in part, tissue repair (Moore et al. 2005). Thus, the
lack of correlation between the initial post-RE increase
in protein synthesis and chronic muscle hypertrophy
(Mitchell et al. 2014) could be due to damage to protein
structuresthatwouldrequirerepair,andthereforeagreater
increase in protein synthetic response. This large protein
synthetic response has led researchers to propose that
muscle damage is concomitant with and a prerequisite
for muscle hypertrophy (Moore et al. 2005; Shepstone
et al. 2005). However, muscle damage is rapidly attenuated
(i.e. the repeated bout effect) (Clarkson & Hubal, 2002;
Chen et al. 2009), raising uncertainty as to the role of
muscle damage per se in long-term RT-induced muscle
hypertrophy.Additionally,regularRTmodifiestheprotein
synthetic response to become much shorter in duration
after each RE bout (Phillips et al. 1999, 2002; Kim et al.
2005; Tang et al. 2008). Considering that the initial acute
protein synthetic response does not correlate with muscle
hypertrophy (Mitchell et al. 2014), and the pattern of
increase in protein synthetic responses is modulated with
RT, it seems plausible that at later times during the
course of RT there is an attenuation and ‘refinement’ of
the protein synthetic response (Wilkinson et al. 2008),
which would result in the protein synthetic response being
directed less toward repair of muscle damage and more
toward muscle fibre hypertrophy.
Methodologically, the use of deuterium oxide (D2O)
ingestion to evaluate MyoPS allows capturing variations
in the protein synthetic response over days to weeks,
thus enabling a more integrative measure not seen in
the hour-to-hour method of tracer infusion. For example,
Brook et al. (2015) showed that MyoPS measured by D2O
ingestion over a 3 week period (RT three times weekly)
was related to the extent of increase in muscle thickness
seen with RT. A subsequent 3 week period (weeks 3–6) of
RT showed that integrated MyoPS had returned to basal
levels and no further relationship with increase in muscle
thickness was found. The return of MyoPS rates to baseline
after only 3 weeks of RT observed by Brook et al. (2015)
is in contrast to multiple studies that have shown that,
even in the trained state, individuals mount a robust acute
(hour-to-hour) protein synthetic response post-RE with
or without nutrition (for review see Damas et al. 2015).
We propose that measuring MyoPS on the days following
RE, rather than over weeks, would provide a more refined
estimation of the contribution of MyoPS to hypertrophy.
We
investigated
how
muscle
hypertrophy
was
modulated throughout RT assessing MyoPS and muscle
damage at the first week (T1), 3 weeks into training
(T2), and at the end of a 10 week RT (T3). MyoPS was
measured using an integrated approach by D2O ingestion
(MacDonald et al. 2013; Wilkinson et al. 2014; Brook et al.
2015) on a day-to-day basis after RE with the rationale
that this would capture an acute but integrated response
over 48 h post-RE. We hypothesized that MyoPS would be

highest at T1, concomitant with highest muscle damage,
but that MyoPS would be attenuated at T2 and T3. We also
hypothesized that muscle damage would be progressively
attenuated throughout the RT programme. Finally, we
hypothesized that the initial MyoPS responses would not
be related to muscle hypertrophy; however, integrated
MyoPS would be related to muscle hypertrophy at T2
and T3.
Methods
Participants
The present study was approved by The Human
Research Ethics Committee of the University of S˜
ao
Paulo (no. 608.754, 27 March 2014) and all procedures
performed were in accordance with the Declaration of
Helsinki. All individuals signed an informed consent
form before participation. A total of 10 healthy young
men (age 27 (1) years, mean (SEM); body mass index
23.6 (1.0) kg m−2; complete participants’ characteristics
arepublishedelsewhere,Damasetal.2016a)withprevious
experience in lower limb RT, but who had not engaged in
lower limb RT for at least 6 months prior to the study and
did not use vitamin supplements or anti-inflammatory
medications chronically, were recruited.
General design
A schematic illustration of the experimental design is
shown in Fig. 1. Participants performed RT for their lower
limbs (bilateral 45 deg leg-press exercise and leg extension)
for 10 weeks (twice a week, totalling 19 workouts). We
studied the participants at three training phases during
the RT programme: T1 (at baseline and after their initial
workout), T2 (at 3 weeks of RT, before and after the
fifth workout) and T3 (at 10 weeks of RT, before and
after the 19th workout). Muscle samples were collected
through biopsies and used to analyse fCSA, MyoPS and
Z-band integrity. At T1, muscle samples were collected
1 day before RE (−24 h), immediately pre-RE (0 h)
and 24 h and 48 h post-RE. At T2 and T3, muscle
biopsies were collected at immediately pre-RE (0 h) and
24 h and 48 h post-RE. fCSAs were assessed using 0 h
biopsies at T1, T2 and T3. Regarding MyoPS, at T1,
we could calculate values for resting MyoPS (difference
between 0 h and −24 h), 24 h (difference between 24 h
post-RE and 0 h), 48 h post-RE (difference between
48 h post-RE and 24 h post-RE) and the integrated first
48 h post-RE (difference between 48 h post-RE and 0 h).
For T2 and T3, we could only calculate MyoPS 24 h and
48 h post-RE, and integrated first 48 h post-RE. Two days
beforethefirstbiopsyineachevaluationweek,participants
ingested a bolus of 100 ml of 70% deuterated water (D2O,
Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Tewksbury, MA, USA)
for the MyoPS analysis, and saliva samples were collected
daily to measure the decay of D2O in total body water. For
Z-band streaming, we used 0 h and 48 h biopsies at T1,
T2 and T3. In addition, we evaluated maximum voluntary
isometric contraction torque (MVC) and SOR before and
24 h and 48 h post-RE at T1, T2 and T3. Blood samples
(4 ml) were collected before and 48 h post-RE for analysis
of CK activity.

Diet and physical activity
Three days before the beginning of the study and
throughout the study period participants were instructed
to maintain their normal eating habits, to not consume
supplements (except those we provided), and to refrain
from other physical activities. Immediately after every
RE bout throughout the RT period each participant
was provided with 25 g of whey protein in order to
maximally stimulate MyoPS (Tipton et al. 1999; Moore
et al. 2009a; Cermak et al. 2012). Importantly, the diet in
the days of biopsies was standardized (22% protein, 41%
carbohydrates and 37% lipids).
Resistance training
TheREprotocolwascomposedof45deginclinedleg-press
and leg extension exercises (3 sets each, 9–12 maximum
bilateral repetitions per set, 90 s rest between sets), with
loadadjustmentsthroughsetsandsessionstomaintainthe
same repetition range (Damas et al. 2016a). Importantly,
every set was performed to volitional fatigue.
Muscle biopsy
Muscle samples from the vastus lateralis were obtained
throughpercutaneousmusclebiopsywithmanualsuction.
Sequential samples were taken from alternate legs;
however, the pre-RE biopsies were always performed in the
same leg at T1, T2 and T3. This procedure was conducted
so the same sequence of legs were biopsied at T1, T2 and
T3 and thus, reducing variability among evaluation weeks.
The biopsy procedure involved administration of local
anaesthesia (2–3 ml of 1% Xylocaine (lignocaine)) and via
a small incision �100 mg of muscle was collected. The
tissue was dissected free from blood and connective tissue.
A small portion (20–30 mg) from the biopsies obtained
before the RE at T1, T2 and T3 was placed in optimum
cutting temperature (OCT) embedding medium with
its fibres perpendicular to the horizontal surface and
quick-frozen in isopentane cooled by liquid nitrogen to
perform fCSA analysis. A larger portion (40–50 mg)
was used to quantify the rate of MyoPS in all of the
muscle specimens collected. Finally, 5–10 mg from the
biopsies obtained before and at 48 h post-RE were
placed in a fixative (2% gluteraldehyde) for staining with
toluidine blue for further light microscopy analysis. After
separation in aliquots, all tissue samples were immediately
frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C until
analysis.
Fibre cross-sectional area (fCSA)
Muscle samples were sectioned at 7 μm, brought to
room temperature and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde
(PFA) for 10 min, washed and then blocked for 90 min
in PBS (containing 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA),
5% fetal bovine serum, 0.02% Triton X-100, 0.1%
sodium azide and 5% goat serum). Subsequently, samples
were incubated overnight with primary antibody (rabbit,
Abcam, Toronto, ON, Canada) against laminin (1:500)
diluted in 1% BSA at 4°C. The next day, slides were
incubated with the secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor
488-R, Invitrogen, Toronto, ON, Canada) at 1:500 in
1% BSA in the dark for 2 h at room temperature.
Samples were then re-washed and coverslipped. Images
were observed and captured using the Nikon Eclipse 90i
microscope at a magnification of ×20 and the Photo-
metrics Cool SNAP HQ2 fluorescent camera (Nikon
Instruments, Melville, NY, USA), respectively. Fibres
were then delineated using the Nikon NIS-Elements AR
software (Nikon Instruments) on a large-scale image. A
mean of 80 fibres were analysed per time point by the
same investigator in a blinded fashion. The reliability
between two blinded measurements was good (typical
error = 2.1%).
Integrated muscle protein fractional synthetic rate
To determine the MyoPS rate, we used the ingestion of
deuterated water (D2O) that has been used previously to
measure protein fractional synthetic rate (FSR) in humans
(Gasier et al. 2012; MacDonald et al. 2013; Wilkinson et al.
2014; Bell et al. 2015). D2O was given to the participants
as a bolus (100 ml of 70% D2O) 48 h before the first biopsy
at T1, T2 and T3. The enrichment of body water with D2O
was assessed through daily saliva samples.
Muscle samples were prepared (isolation, hydro-
lysing, purification and derivatization of the myofibrillar
proteins) following procedures described by Moore et al.
(2009b) and Burd et al. (2012). Briefly, a portion of
muscle (40–50 mg) was homogenized on ice in buffer
(10 μl mg−1 25 mM Tris, 0.5% v/v Triton X-100 and
protease/phosphatase inhibitor cocktail tablets (Complete
Protease Inhibitor Mini-Tabs, Roche, Indianapolis, IN,
USA; PhosSTOP, Roche Applied Science, Mannhein,
Germany)). Samples were then centrifuged at 1500 g for
10 min at 4°C to separate the supernatant (sarcoplasmic)
and pellet (myofibrillar) fractions. The myofibrillar
fraction was stored at −80°C for future processing. The
myofibrillar pellet was solubilized in 1 ml NaOH (0.3 M)
and heated to 50°C for 30 min with vortex mixing every
10 min. Samples were centrifuged at 4000 g for 5 min at
4°C, the supernatant containing the myofibrillar fraction
was collected and the collagen pellets discarded. Myo-
fibrillar proteins were precipitated by adding 1 ml of
1 M perchloric acid (PCA) and spinning at 700 g for
10 min at 4°C. The supernatant was discarded and the
pellet was washed using 1 ml of 70% ethanol. Amino
acids from myofibrillar proteins were released using
acid hydrolysis by incubating in 1 ml HCl (1 M) and

1 ml of Dowex resin (50WX8-200 resin; Sigma-Aldrich)
with HCl (0.5 M) and heated to 100°C for 72 h with
vortex mixing every 24 h. Samples were eluted from
the resin with 2 M NH4OH and evaporated to dryness.
Muscle preparations were analysed by Metabolic Solutions
for incorporation of deuterated alanine with a Thermo
Finnigan Delta V IRMS coupled to a Thermo Trace GC
Ultra with a GC pyrolysis interface III and Conflow IV
(gas chromatograph (GC)-pyrolysis-isotope ratio mass
spectrometer (IRMS)) (Metabolic Solutions, Nashua,
NH, USA). The N-acetyl-n-propyl ester of alanine was
analysed using a splitless injection with a CTC Pal auto-
sampler (1 μl), at an injection temperature of 250°C,
and using a Zebron ZB-5 column of 30 m × 0.25 mm
× 0.50 μm film thickness (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA,
USA). The GC oven was programmed with an initial
column temperature of 80°C with a 2 min hold, followed
by a ramp of 30°C per minute up to 330°C. Compounds
eluting off the column were directed into the pyrolysis
reactor, heated at 1450°C and converted to hydrogen gas.
The deuterated enrichment was first initially expressed
in δ values compared to a calibrated hydrogen gas
and then converted to atom% by standard equations.
Methylpalmitate (courtesy of Dr Arndt Schimmelmann,
Biogeochemical Laboratories, Indiana University) was
used as the calibration standard.
Saliva samples were analysed for deuterium enrichment
by cavity ring-down spectroscopy using a Liquid Water
Isotope Analyser with automated injection system, version
2 upgrade (Los Gatos Research, Mountain View, CA,
USA).Sampleswerevortexedandspunat2000gtoremove
any particulates. The water phase of saliva was injected
6 times and the average of the last three measurements
used for data analysis. A standard curve was run before and
after samples for calculation of deuterium enrichment.
Intra-run precision was less than 2δ per millilitre (parts
per thousand) and inter-run precision was less than 3.5δ
per millilitre.
Myofibrillar protein fractional synthetic rate (FSR,
% day−1) was determined from the incorporation
of deuterium-labelled alanine into protein, using the
enrichment of body water (corrected for the mean number
of deuterium moieties incorporated per alanine, 3.7, and
the dilution from the total number of hydrogens in the
derivative,11)asthesurrogateprecursorlabellingbetween

Toluidine blue-stained light microscopy
Tissuesampleswerefixedinosmiumtetroxide,dehydrated
in graded ethanol baths and embedded in epoxy resin
(Spurr’s) with fibres oriented longitudinally. Each block
was sectioned (0.5 mm) and marked with toluidine blue.
Individual fibres for each section of longitudinal muscle
were examined at ×1000 magnification in a light micro-
scope for areas of Z-band streaming. In a pilot experiment,
we selected sections identified to be damaged using
toluidine blue staining/light microscopy and confirmed
the disruption with ultrathin sections from the same
blocks under electron microscopy examination; in this
experiment there was excellent inter-rater agreement
(intraclass correlation coefficient 0.97) on damaged
sections. Z-band streaming was scored by two methods
always using longitudinal cuts. First, the total visible
fibre area and Z-band streaming area were calculated
in each image and percentage area occupied by Z-band
streaming per total fibre area analysed was recorded.
Second, the number of fibres that showed a visible area
of Z-band streaming was counted and the percentage of
affected fibres per total number of fibres analysed was
determined. We analysed the images acknowledging if we
were analysing the same fibre as in the previous image or
a new fibre. Several times, different parts of the same fibre
were analysed in more than one image. The mean number
(SD) of fibres analysed per subject per time point was:
23 (15), range 10–60, and the number of images analysed
was 28 (20), range 10–96. Figure 2 depicts an example of
a normal (non-affected) fibre (i.e. no Z-band streaming;
Fig. 2A) and a fibre exhibiting Z-band streaming (Fig. 2B).
With the 0 h biopsy (i.e. pre-RE) sample as the basis of
comparison, we ensured that no damage had occurred as
a result of the biopsy procedure. The same investigator
analysed all images in a blinded fashion and the reliability
betweentwoblindedmeasurementswasverygood(typical
error = 1%).
Indirect markers of muscle damage (MVC, SOR
and plasma CK activity)
Participants were evaluated for their knee extension
MVC in an isokinetic dynamometer (Biodex System
Pro 4, Biodex Medical Systems, Shirley, NY, USA).
Extraneous movements were restrained by straps across
their chest, waist and thigh of their dominant leg. The
hip joint was fixed at 85 deg of flexion and arms
were folded across their chest. A specific warm-up
composed of two sets of three knee extensions/flexions
contractions (90 deg s−1; 90 deg of range of motion)
separated by 30 s rest interval was performed before
measurements. After 60 s, the participants performed
three knee extension MVC attempts (5 s duration) at
60 deg of knee extension to the horizontal, separated by
C

60 s rest intervals (Damas et al. 2016a). The highest peak
torque obtained among the three attempts was considered
as the MVC value. All participants were verbally
encouraged to contract as hard as possible. The reliability
between two repeated measures was good (typical
error = 3.6%).
Perceived SOR was assessed using a 100 mm visual
analog scale (0 mm: ‘not sore at all’, 100 mm: ‘very, very
sore’) (Nogueira et al. 2014). Participants assessed their
SOR by placing a mark on the scale after sitting and rising
from a chair without any help of the arms two times. The
distance in millimetres between zero and the mark on the
scale was used for subsequent analyses.
Blood samples (4 ml) were drawn from an antecubital
vein for CK analysis. Samples were centrifuged for 10 min
to obtain plasma and stored at −80◦C. CK activity was
measured using a colorimetric kit (Sigma, MAK116;
Oakville, ON, Canada). The normal reference range for
CK activity using this method is 20–180 U l−1. The
intra-assay coefficient of variation on 10 repeat samples
was <5%.
Statistical analysis
TotestfortheeffectsofRTinfCSAandthechange(0–48h)
in the dependent variables, a mixed model analysis was
used having training phase (T1, T2 and T3) as fixed factor
and subjects as a random factor. To analyse the changes
in the change in MyoPS two procedures were conducted.
Firstly, we tested if MyoPS 24 h and 48 h post-RE at T1,
T2 and T3 were different from resting MyoPS (−24 h to
0 h) at T1 (i.e. control condition) using a Dunnett’s test.
Secondly, to investigate if changes in MyoPS 24 h and 48 h
post-RE were different among training phases we applied
a mixed model assuming acute time changes (24 h and
48 h) and training phase (T1, T2 and T3) as fixed factors
and subjects as a random factor. To analyse differences in
the changes in indirect markers of muscle damage over
time at different training phases a mixed model assuming
time and training phase as fixed factors and subjects as a
random factor was used. In all models when a significant
F value was obtained, a Fisher’s LSD was used for pair-wise
comparisons. We performed a series of correlations using
the Pearson’s product moment correlation between hyper-
trophic variables (MyoPS, fCSA and vastus lateralis (VL)
CSA (VL CSA data from Damas et al. 2016a)) and muscle
damage variables (Z-band streaming, MVC, SOR and
CK), and between acute measurements of hypertrophic
responses (MyoPS) and chronic hypertrophic outcomes
(fCSA and VL CSA). Correlation coefficients |r| < 0.2
were considered small; 0.2 < |r| < 0.7, moderate; and
|r| > 0.7, high. Significance level was set as P � 0.05.
Data are presented as means (SEM) unless otherwise
stated.

Figure 5A shows that MyoPS increased significantly 24 h
and 48 h T1, 24 h T2 and 24 h T3 compared to resting value
at T1 (P � 0.05). There were greater changes in MyoPS
at T1 than at both T2 and T3 (P < 0.03), but similar
changes were found at T2 and T3 (P = 0.748). In addition,
MyoPS values 24 h were higher than 48 h independent
of training phase (P = 0.003). Integrated MyoPS over the
first 48 h (0–48 h) after RE indicated higher values for
T1 compared with T2 and T3 (P < 0.03) (values at T2
and T3 were similar, P = 0.8) (Fig. 5B). In an attempt
to account for the amount of MyoPS required only to
repair (not induce hypertrophy) the ‘damaged’ area we
corrected the MyoPS for the Z-band streaming area (using
the first method for Z-band streaming calculation that
considers the ‘area’ explained in the Methods) using the
formulae: MyoPS × (100 − Z-band streaming)/100. After
the correction, no differences were found between T1, T2
and T3 (P > 0.05; Fig. 5C).

Z-band streaming
Figure 6 shows the two scores of the magnitude of muscle
damage through Z-band streaming. Figure 6A reveals the
change after RE in the percentage of Z-band streaming
area per total fibre area at T1, T2 and T3. The change
from baseline in the areas with Z-band streaming after RE
at T1 was greater than at T3 only (P = 0.006) (Fig. 6A).
Figure 6B depicts the change in the percentage of fibres
that presented any sign of Z-band streaming after RE at
the three training phases (i.e. T1, T2 and T3). At T1, there
was a higher percentage of affected fibres than at T2 and
T3 (P < 0.001) (Fig. 6B).
Indirect markers of muscle damage
Baseline values for MVC at T1, T2 and T3 are reported
in Damas et al. (2016a). We reported there that the RT
protocolwaseffectivetoincreasemusclestrength,i.e.MVC
pre-RE at T3 was greater than before the beginning of
RT (baseline at T1) (Damas et al. 2016a). All indirect
markers of muscle damage (MVC, SOR and CK) showed
significant changes from baseline at T1: MVC decreased
and SOR increased at 24 h and 48 h and CK increased at
48 h compared to baseline (P < 0.001 for all). At T2, only
SOR slightly increased at 24 h versus baseline (P = 0.033),
but no other change was found at T2 or T3 from baseline
for the other variables. In addition, MVC and SOR at 24 h
and 48 h T1, and CK at 48 h T1, were significant different
(P < 0.001) from the same time points at T2 and T3. The
CK value was slightly higher at 48 h T2 compared with
48 h T3 (P = 0.035) (Table 1).

Discussion
We discovered that both MyoPS and muscle damage were
highest after an initial bout of RE, but neither were
correlated with RT-induced skeletal muscle/fibre hyper-
trophy, which is in agreement with our earlier work
(Mitchell et al. 2014). Despite the lack of correlation
between initial MyoPS and muscle hypertrophy, we
observed that early (T2) and later (T3) rates of MyoPS,
while attenuated compared to T1, were correlated with
muscle hypertrophy. We also report that directly measured

Muscle protein synthesis, hypertrophy and muscle damage in humans
5217
muscle damage, which was progressively mitigated
throughout RT reaching a minimal magnitude at the end
of 10 weeks of RT, did not correlate with MyoPS or hyper-
trophy at any time point during RT. Our data provide
novel insight into the antecedents of RT-induced muscle
hypertrophy showing that at both early and later training
phases, when muscle damage progressively subsides, the
change in MyoPS after RE is directed to support muscle
fibre hypertrophy.
Our data are in agreement with the thesis that, in an
untrained state, MyoPS would be increased to a larger
extent than in a trained state (Damas et al. 2015). We
used an integrated approach and measured MyoPS over
days (as opposed to hours), with the participants in fed
and fasted states, and showed that the rise in MyoPS is
attenuated in a trained state (T3) in comparison with
an untrained state (T1). Interestingly, we also show an
early (at T2) attenuation in MyoPS post-RE compared
with that observed at T1, with no difference between the
attenuated MyoPS rates post-RE at T2 and T3. Despite
a potent increase in integrated MyoPS in the first 48 h
after the very first bout of RE, this rise did not correlate
with long-term muscle hypertrophy (Table 2); a finding
that is congruent with previous results using infusion
trials (Mayhew et al. 2009; Mitchell et al. 2014) in which
hour-to-hour protein synthetic rates were measured.
Importantly, we demonstrate that the change in integrated
0–48 h MyoPS post-RE at the end of the RT period
(T3) was correlated (r = 0.91) with the increase in fCSA
after 10 weeks of RT, and further, the changes in MyoPS
0–48 h post-RE at both T2 and T3 were significantly and
also highly correlated (r = 0.86 and r = 0.94) with the
increases in VL muscle CSA (data from Damas et al.
2016a) after 10 weeks of RT (Table 2). It is worth noting
that the integrated 0–48 h MyoPS response at T2 showed
a reasonable agreement (r � 0.7) with the increase in
fCSA after 10 weeks of RT. A recent study measured the
integrative MyoPS throughout the first 3 weeks of RT
(participants trained three times a week) and found a
significantcorrelation(r�0.7)withtheincreaseinmuscle
thickness (Brook et al. 2015). The authors also showed a
down-regulation in MyoPS with further training (decline
in 3 weeks integrated – weeks 3–6 – MyoPS), which
returned to pre-training values. In agreement with Brook
et al. (2015), our results demonstrate an early attenuation
of MyoPS at T2 versus T1 with no further changes from T2
toT3;however,weobservedsignificantincreasesinMyoPS
during the first 24 h of post-RE at T2 and T3. While our
results may appear discordant with those of Brook et al.
(2015), we propose that the difference is explained by
the fact that our measurements were over days (24 h and
48 h) while theirs were taken over weeks. Based on our
present and previous data (Phillips et al. 1997), MyoPS
peaks 24 h post-RE and begins to decline, thus measuring
MyoPS across 3 weeks (Brook et al. 2015) would have
yielded a less temporally resolved picture of the increase
in MyoPS after each RE bout. Additionally, we show that
beyond 3 weeks of RT the changes in MyoPS post-RE
are attenuated compared to the change post-RE in the
first week. Thus, what Brook et al. (2015) reported, we
suggest, were progressively smaller increments in MyoPS
after each RE beyond 3 weeks and these increments would
have been ‘diluted’ by measuring MyoPS over a 3 week
period. In turn, this would lead to a reduction in over-
all MyoPS returning to pre-training values and a lack of
correlation between MyoPS with muscle hypertrophy in
that phase of RT. Therefore, our results expand on those of
Brook et al. (2015) by allowing a more temporally resolved
picture of MyoPS during an RT programme. We report
that integrative 48 h post-RE MyoPS is already lower at an
early phase (week 3; T2) but is not further attenuated after
10 weeks of RT. Importantly, and in general agreement

with Brook et al. (2015), we report that MyoPS at T2 was
correlated with muscle hypertrophy (increase in VL CSA
at T3 − T1), but we expand the findings showing that the
change in MyoPS post-RE after 10 weeks of RT (at T3) is
also highly correlated with hypertrophy (increase in fCSA
and VL CSA at T3 − T1).
Our RT programme promoted significant muscle fibre
hypertrophy (�14%) that was evident only at the end
of the RT period (T3; Fig. 3). This finding corroborates
our previous proposal that early increases in VL muscle
CSA measured using ultrasound imaging are, to some
extent, due to oedematous muscle swelling (i.e. not
true fibre hypertrophy) probably induced by muscle
damage caused by the early RE bouts in an RT programme
(Damas et al. 2016a,b). As expected, the first RE bout
promotedsignificantmuscledamage,asevidencedbyboth

found at T1 is lower than in previous investigations
utilizing eccentrically biased RE (Gibala et al. 1995; Beaton
et al. 2002a). Accordingly, the magnitude of changes in
indirect markers are representative of mild-to-moderate
damage (Paulsen et al. 2012) and are not indicative of loss
of myofibrillar proteins (Stupka et al. 2001; Yu & Thornell,
2002;Cramerietal.2004,2007;Coronaetal.2010;Murphy
etal.2013).Indeed,allchangesinindirectdamagemarkers
returned to baseline values at T2 and the magnitude
of change in MVC, SOR and CK after RE at T2 was
substantially attenuated. This RT-induced attenuation of
damage Z-band streaming was not complete at T2 (Fig. 6).
The early potent repeated bout effect (i.e. within the
first RE bouts) extensively demonstrated in the literature
(Nosaka et al. 2007; Chen et al. 2009, 2012, 2013; Muthalib
et al. 2011; Starbuck & Eston, 2012) is only manifest by
indirect markers (e.g. MVC, SOR and CK), not by Z-band
streaming, at least when using a continuous traditional
RT regimen. After 19 RE bouts (at T3) we were able
to detect an attenuation of Z-band streaming, but we
acknowledge that the attenuation might have happened
earlier (somewhere between T2 and T3). Previously,
a study using a cross-sectional design demonstrated
that the amount of muscle damage shown by Z-band
streaming after RE is higher for untrained versus trained
individuals (Gibala et al. 2000). We expand these findings
providing longitudinal (intra-individual) evidence of the
difference in Z-band streaming at different training
status.
We
noted
a
moderate
correlation
between
the
magnitude of Z-band streaming and the change in MyoPS
post-RE at T1 (r � 0.6, P = 0.09; Table 2). This, added
to the fact that MyoPS at T1 does not correlate with
hypertrophy, leads us to speculate that the increase in
MyoPS seen at T1 is related more to ‘repair’ of damaged
proteins resulting from the unaccustomed RE bout. Our
proposal is that the initial response of MyoPS may be
directed more toward increasing sarcomeres in series (Yu
et al. 2004), rather than in parallel (i.e. muscle hyper-
trophy). Indeed, Fig. 5C supports this notion since when
the overall change in MyoPS in the 48 h after RE is
normalized to the percentage area with Z-band streaming
(which can be considered a rough way of accounting for
the amount of MyoPS required to repair a ‘damaged’
area), the increase in MyoPS at T1 (Fig. 5A and B) is
no longer significant and all three training phases (T1,
T2 and T3) showed similar MyoPS values. Thus, when
the stress of RE is novel, it promotes a potent increase
in MyoPS to support muscle repair rather than promote
increases in muscle fibre CSA. Nonetheless, the MyoPS
response rapidly adapts and by the third week of RT (T2)
or even earlier, indirect markers of muscle damage show
potent attenuation post-RE, and even though Z-band
streaming is still present (albeit attenuated in magnitude),
MyoPS is directed more to support an increase in fCSA.
Altogether, our data indicate that muscle damage does
not have a role in skeletal muscle hypertrophic responses
during prolonged RT. That is, individuals who present
more muscle damage do not necessarily have a greater
hypertrophic response.
One limitation of our work was that we did not measure
restingMyoPSatT2andT3.Avarietyofresistancetraining
studies have shown either no change (Phillips et al. 1999;
Tangetal.2008)orincreased(Phillipsetal.2002;Kimetal.
2005) hourly rates of mixed but not myofibrillar protein
synthesis (Kim et al. 2005; Wilkinson et al. 2008). Thus,
we speculate that either a small increase or, more likely, no
change would have occurred in resting MyoPS rates at T2
and T3, compared to T1. Importantly, however, despite
our choice not to measure resting MyoPS at T2 and T3 we
still observed that the change in MyoPS after RE was lower
at T2 and T3 than at T1 and that there were significant
correlations between the integrated MyoPS response (i.e.
0–48 h MyoPS after RE at T2 and T3) and hypertrophy.
We speculate that our ability to see these correlations was
due to the fact that changes in resting MyoPS with RT are
not the main reason for hypertrophy and that despite an
attenuated change in MyoPS after RE as RT progresses the
periodic increases in MyoPS are still the main contributor
to protein accrual.
In summary, we report that the first RE bout in an
RT programme promotes the largest change in MyoPS,
marked Z-band streaming, and changes in indirect
markers of damage, but none of these variables correlate
with hypertrophy. Early in an RT programme (week 3,
T2) there was an attenuation of MyoPS after RE, Z-band
streaming was present, but attenuated. Also, MyoPS,
but not muscle damage, correlated with hypertrophy at
week 3. At 10 weeks, changes in damage markers
(including Z-band streaming) after RE were potently
attenuated, but changes in MyoPS after RE were similar
to those observed at the third week of RT and still
highly correlated with muscle/fibre hypertrophy. When
changes in MyoPS were normalized to the area of Z-band
streaming, the response of MyoPS was similar at all
times. We propose that the initial RE bout(s) promotes
a robust but potentially non-hypertrophy-directed but
instead ‘repair-oriented’ increase in MyoPS; nonetheless,
early on in the RT programme, adaptations in the changes
in MyoPS after RE occur to promote primarily muscle
hypertrophy. Thus, muscle hypertrophy is the result of
accumulated increases in MyoPS after RE mainly after
attenuation of muscle damage.

Author contributions
All experiments were conducted at the University of Sao Paulo.
F.D., S.M.P., C.A.L., F.C.V., M.E.L., V.T., H.R. and C.U. designed
the study. Participants were recruited and tested by F.D., F.C.V.,
M.E.L. and P.R.J. F.D. also had the initial idea for the study,
analysed the fCSA, Z-band streaming and muscle damage
indirect markers, prepared the muscle for MyoPS, performed
all statistical analyses, designed the graphs/tables, and wrote the
first version of the manuscript. P.R.J.also prepared the tissue
for Z-band streaming analyses. L.A.R.C. performed the muscle
biopsies. A.V.B. prepared the muscle tissue for muscle fibre area
analyses. T.S. and G.P. helped with the fibre area analyses. All
authors contributed to the manuscript, reviewed it, approved
