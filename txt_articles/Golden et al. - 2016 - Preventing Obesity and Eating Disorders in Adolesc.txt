abstract
Obesity and eating disorders (EDs) are both prevalent in adolescents. There 
are concerns that obesity prevention efforts may lead to the development of 
an ED. Most adolescents who develop an ED did not have obesity previously, 
but some teenagers, in an attempt to lose weight, may develop an ED. This 
clinical report addresses the interaction between obesity prevention and 
EDs in teenagers, provides the pediatrician with evidence-informed tools 
to identify behaviors that predispose to both obesity and EDs, and provides 
guidance about obesity and ED prevention messages. The focus should be 
on a healthy lifestyle rather than on weight. Evidence suggests that obesity 
prevention and treatment, if conducted correctly, do not predispose to EDs.
CLINICAL REPORT
Guidance for the Clinician in Rendering Pediatric Care
INTRODUCTION
The prevalence of childhood obesity has increased dramatically over the 
past few decades in the United States and other countries, and obesity 
during adolescence is associated with significant medical morbidity 
during adulthood. 
1 Eating disorders (EDs) are the third most common 
chronic condition in adolescents, after obesity and asthma. 
2 Most 
adolescents who develop an ED did not have obesity previously, but 
some adolescents may misinterpret what “healthy eating” is and engage 
in unhealthy behaviors, such as skipping meals or using fad diets in an 
attempt to “be healthier, 
” the result of which could be the development 
of an ED. 
3 Messages from pediatricians addressing obesity and reviewing 
constructive ways to manage weight can be safely and supportively 
incorporated into health care visits. Avoiding certain weight-based 
language and using motivational interviewing (MI) techniques may 
improve communication and promote successful outcomes when 
providing weight-management counseling. 
4
This clinical report complements existing American Academy of 
Pediatrics (AAP) reports on EDs 
5 and obesity prevention. 
6 The aim is to 
address the interaction between obesity prevention and EDs in teenagers 
and to stress that obesity prevention does not promote the development

of EDs in adolescents. This report 
provides the pediatrician with office-
based, evidence-informed tools to 
identify behaviors that predispose to 
both obesity and EDs and to provide 
guidance about obesity and ED 
prevention messages.
INCREASING PREVALENCE OF 
ADOLESCENT OBESITY
Data from the NHANES on adolescent 
obesity prevalence revealed that, 
in 2011–2012, 20.5% of 12- to 
19-year-olds were obese (BMI ≥95th 
percentile according to the 2000 sex-
specific BMI-for-age growth charts 
of the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention). 
7, 
 
8 Combining 
the definitions of overweight 
(BMI between the 85th and 95th 
percentiles) and obesity, according 
to the NHANES 2011–2012 data, 
34.5% of 12- to 19-year-olds were 
overweight or obese. 
7, 
 
8 Disparities 
exist in obesity rates among minority 
youth, with Hispanic, American 
Indian, and African-American 
adolescents having the highest 
prevalence of obesity. Over the 
past 30 years, the rate of childhood 
obesity has more than doubled, and 
the rate of adolescent obesity has 
quadrupled. However, more recent 
data over the past 9 years between 
2003–2004 and 2011–2012 have 
revealed no significant changes in 
obesity prevalence in youth or adults. 
Although halting the increase in the 
rate of obesity is a step in the right 
direction, the prevalence of obesity 
remains high, and its health care 
burden and costs remain significant.9
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CHILDHOOD 
OBESITY AND ADULT HEALTH STATUS
Most studies have found that children 
and adolescents who are obese, 
especially those in the higher range 
of BMI percentiles, are more likely 
to be obese as adults. 
10 
– 
12 The health 
consequences of obesity can manifest 
during childhood, but the longer a 
person is obese, the more at risk he 
or she is for adult health problems. 
A high adolescent BMI increases 
adult diabetes and coronary artery 
disease risks by nearly threefold 
and fivefold, respectively. 
13 Type 2 
diabetes is one of the most serious 
complications of childhood obesity. 
Risks of other common comorbid 
conditions, such as hypertension, 
abnormal lipid profiles, nonalcoholic 
fatty liver disease, gallstones, 
gastroesophageal reflux, polycystic 
ovary syndrome, obstructive sleep 
apnea, asthma, and bone and 
joint problems, are significantly 
increased in both obese adolescents 
and adults who were obese as 
adolescents.1, 
 
14 
– 
16 In addition, the 
psychosocial morbidities associated 
with childhood obesity, such as 
depression, poor self-esteem, and 
poor quality of life, are of significant 
concern.

PREVALENCE OF EDS IN CHILDREN AND 
ADOLESCENTS AND CHANGES IN DSM-5 
DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA
The onset of EDs usually is during 
adolescence, with the highest 
prevalence in adolescent girls, 
but EDs increasingly are being 
recognized in children as young as 5 
to 12 years. 
20 
– 
22 Increased prevalence 
rates also have been noted in males 
and minority youth. 
23 The peak age 
of onset for anorexia nervosa (AN) 
is early to mid-adolescence, and 
the peak age of onset for bulimia 
nervosa (BN) is late adolescence. 
Although overall incidence rates 
have been stable, there has been a 
notable increase in the incidence of 
AN in 15- to 19-year-old girls.24 In 
the United States from 1999 to 2006, 
hospitalizations for EDs increased 
119% for children younger than 12 
years. 
25 The lifetime prevalences of 
AN, BN, and binge eating disorder 
in adolescent females are 0.3%, 
0.9%, and 1.6%, respectively. 
26 The 
reported female-to-male ratio is 9:1, 
but increasing numbers of males with 
EDs are being recognized, especially 
among younger age groups. 
20 
–22
The Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth 
Edition (DSM-5) criteria for EDs are 
listed in  
Table 1. 
27 The diagnostic 
criteria for both AN and BN in the 
DSM-5 are less stringent than in the 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of 
Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text 
Revision, so the numbers of reported 
cases likely will increase. For AN, the 
85% expected body weight threshold 
and the amenorrhea criterion 
from the Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth 
Edition, Text Revision, both have 
been eliminated in the DSM-5. For 
BN, DSM-5 modifications from the 
previous edition include reducing 
the threshold of the frequency of 
binge eating and inappropriate 
compensatory behaviors (self-
induced vomiting, periods of 
starvation, compulsive exercising 
or the use of laxatives, diuretics, or 
diet pills) from twice a week for 3 
months to once a week for 3 months. 
Binge eating disorder now is officially 
recognized in the DSM-5 as a distinct 
disorder characterized by recurrent 
episodes of bingeing at least once 
a week for 3 months, but without 
compensatory behaviors, and is 
associated with the development of 
obesity. 
28 “Atypical AN” describes 
a subset of patients who lost a 
significant amount of weight and then 
returned to normal weight but who 
continue to have preoccupations with 
body shape and weight, comparable 
to patients with “classic” AN.
MEDICAL COMPLICATIONS ASSOCIATED 
WITH EDS
The medical complications of EDs 
have been well described elsewhere. 
5 
In general, medical complications 
are either the result of physiologic 
adaptations to the effects of 
malnutrition or a consequence of 
unhealthy weight-control behaviors. 
Young people who have lost large 
amounts of weight or lost weight too 
rapidly can develop hypothermia, 
bradycardia, hypotension, and

orthostasis even if their current 
weight is in the normal range. 
29, 
 
30 
Rapid weight loss can be associated 
with acute pancreatitis and gallstone 
formation. Electrolyte disturbances 
can occur secondary to self-induced 
vomiting or the use of laxatives or 
diuretics or can develop when food is 
reintroduced after prolonged periods 
of dietary restriction (the so-called 
refeeding syndrome). Dietary 
restriction can lead to primary or 
secondary amenorrhea in adolescent 
girls of even normal weight as a 
result of the suppression of the 
hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis, 
which is mediated in part by leptin. 
31 
Prolonged amenorrhea results in 
a low-estrogen state, which can 
contribute to osteoporosis.23
THE INTERACTION BETWEEN EDS AND 
OBESITY PREVENTION IN ADOLESCENTS
Most adolescents who develop an 
ED were not previously overweight. 
However, it is not unusual for an ED 
to begin with a teenager “trying to 
eat healthy.” 
32 Some adolescents and 
their parents misinterpret obesity 
prevention messages and begin 
eliminating foods they consider 
to be “bad” or “unhealthy.” 
32 US 
Food and Drug Administration–
mandated nutrition facts on food 
labels list percent daily values based 
on a 2000-kcal diet. Moderately 
active adolescent girls require 
approximately 2200 kcal/day, and 
moderately active adolescent boys 
require 2800 kcal/day for normal 
growth and development. Teenagers 
who are athletes require even higher 
caloric intakes. 
33 Strict adherence 
to a 2000-kcal/day diet may lead to 
an energy deficit and weight loss for 
many growing teenagers.
Adolescents who are overweight may 
adopt disordered eating behaviors 
while attempting to lose weight. In 
cross-sectional studies, adolescents 
who are overweight have been shown 
to engage in self-induced vomiting 
or laxative use more frequently than 
their normal-weight peers. 
34, 
 
35 Some 
adolescents who were overweight 
or obese previously can go on to 
develop a full ED. 
3, 
 
30, 
32 In 1 study 
in adolescents seeking treatment of 
an ED, 36.7% had a previous weight 
greater than the 85th percentile 
for age and sex. 
3 Initial attempts to 
lose weight by eating in a healthy 
manner may progress to severe 
dietary restriction, skipping of meals, 
prolonged periods of starvation, or 
the use of self-induced vomiting, diet 
pills, or laxatives. Initial attempts 
to increase physical activity may 
progress to compulsive and excessive 
exercise, even to the point at which 
the teenager awakens at night to 
exercise or continues excess exercise 
despite injury. EDs that develop in 
the context of previous obesity can 
present with challenges that delay 
treatment of the ED. 
32 At first, weight 
loss is praised and reinforced by 
family members, friends, and health 
care providers, but ongoing excessive 
preoccupation with weight loss can 
lead to social isolation, irritability,

Key Features of DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Feeding Disorders and EDs
AN
 • Restriction of food eaten leading to lower than expected body weight
 • Intense fear of weight gain or being fat
 • Body image distortion
 Types: restricting or binge eating/purging
BN
 • Binge eating in which
  o a larger amount of food is eaten within a 2-hour period compared with peers; and
  o there is a perceived lack of control during the time of the binge
 • Repeated use of unhealthy behaviors after a binge to prevent weight gain: (vomiting; abuse of 
laxatives, diuretics, or other medications; food restriction; or excessive exercise)
 • Behaviors occur at least once a week for 3 months
 • Self-worth is overly based on body shape and weight
 • Behaviors occur distinctly apart from AN
Binge-eating disorder
 • Recurrent episodes of binge eating in which
  o a larger amount of food is eaten within a 2-hour period compared with peers; and
  o there is a perceived lack of control during the time of the binge
 Bingeing episodes are associated with at least 3 of the following:
  o eating faster than normal;
  o eating until overly full;
  o eating large quantities of food when not hungry;
  o eating alone because of embarrassment about the quantity of food eaten; and
  o feeling badly emotionally after eating

BN
Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder
 • A feeding problem that results in at least one of the following:
  o signifi
 cant weight loss or failure to meet the expected weight or height gain in children;
  o signifi
 cant nutritional defi
 ciency;

difficulty concentrating, profound 
fear of gaining the lost weight 
back, and body image distortion. 
If the pediatrician only focuses on 
weight loss without identifying the 
associated concerning symptoms 
and signs, an underlying ED may be 
missed.
EVIDENCE-BASED MANAGEMENT 
STRATEGIES ASSOCIATED WITH BOTH 
OBESITY AND EDS IN TEENAGERS
Cross-sectional and longitudinal 
observational studies have identified 
the following certain behaviors 
associated with both obesity and EDs 
in adolescents:
1. Dieting. Dieting, defined as 
caloric restriction with the goal 
of weight loss, is a risk factor 
for both obesity and EDs. In a 
large prospective cohort study in 
9- to 14-year-olds (N = 16 882) 
followed for 2 years, dieting 
was associated with greater 
weight gain and increased rates 
of binge eating in both boys and 
girls. 
36 Similarly, in a prospective 
observational study in 2516 
adolescents enrolled in Project 
Eating Among Teens (Project 
EAT) followed for 5 years, dieting 
behaviors were associated 
with a twofold increased risk 
of becoming overweight and a 
1.5-fold increased risk of binge 
eating at 5-year follow-up after 
adjusting for weight status at 
baseline. 
37 Stice et al 
38 showed 
that girls without obesity who 
dieted in the ninth grade were 3 
times more likely to be overweight 
in the 12th grade compared with 
nondieters. These findings and 
others 
36, 
38, 
 
39 suggest that dieting 
is counterproductive to weight-
management efforts. Dieting 
also can predispose to EDs. In a 
large prospective cohort study 
in students 14 to 15 years of age 
followed for 3 years, dieting was 
the most important predictor of 
a developing ED. Students who 
severely restricted their energy 
intake and skipped meals were 
18 times more likely to develop 
an ED than those who did not 
diet; those who dieted at a 
moderate level had a fivefold 
increased risk. 
40
2. Family meals. Family meals have 
been associated with improved 
dietary intake and provide 
opportunities for modeling 
behavior by parents, even though 
family meals have not been shown 
to prevent obesity across ethnic 
groups. 
41 
– 
43 A higher frequency 
of family meals is associated 
with improved dietary quality, 
as evidenced by increased 
consumption of fruits, vegetables, 
grains, and calcium-rich foods and 
fiber and reduced consumption 
of carbonated beverages. 
44 
Eating family meals together 7 
or more times per week resulted 
in families consuming 1 serving 
more of fruits and vegetables 
per day compared with families 
who had no meals together. 
These improvements in dietary 
intake were sustained 5 years 
later during young adulthood.45 
Family meals also have been 
shown to protect girls from 
disordered eating behaviors. 
46 
– 
48 
Most recently, a prospective 
study in more than 13 000 
preadolescents and adolescents 
found that eating family dinners 
most days or every day during 
the previous year was protective 
against purging behaviors, binge 
eating, and frequent dieting. 
The trend was similar in both 
females and males, although not 
statistically significant in males. 
48 
In girls, family meals perceived 
to be enjoyable were protective 
from extreme weight-control 
behaviors.46 Postulates for why 
family meals are protective 
include the following: families 
will consume healthier foods than 
teenagers would choose on their 
own; parents can model healthy 
food choices; family meals provide 
a time for teenagers and parents 
to interact; and parents can 
monitor their child’s eating and 
address issues earlier when they 
are aware of their child’s eating 
behavior. 
49
3. Weight talk. Weight talk by family 
members refers to comments 
made by family members about 
their own weight or comments 
made to the child by parents 
to encourage weight loss. Even 
well-intended comments can 
be perceived as hurtful by the 
child or adolescent. Several 
studies have found that parental 
weight talk, whether it involves 
encouraging their children to diet 
or talking about their own dieting, 
is linked to overweight 
37, 
 
50 and 
EDs. 
51 Project EAT linked weight 
talk to higher rates of overweight 
5 years later. Loth et al 
51 
interviewed patients in recovery 
from EDs and found that weight 
talk affected them negatively. 
Parents who had conversations 
about weight had adolescents 
who were more likely to engage 
in dieting, unhealthy weight-
control behaviors, and binge 
eating. However, if the focus 
of the conversation was only 
on healthful eating behaviors, 
overweight adolescents were less 
likely to diet and to use unhealthy 
weight-control behaviors.52
4. Weight teasing. In overweight 
adolescents, weight teasing 
by peers or family members is 
experienced by 40% of early 
adolescent females (mean age: 
12.8 ± 0.7 years), 28.2% of 
middle adolescent females (mean 
age: 15.9 ± 0.8 years), 37% of 
early adolescent males, and 29% 
of middle adolescent males. 
53 
Family weight teasing predicts 
the development of overweight 
status, binge eating, and extreme 
weight-control behaviors in girls 
and overweight status in boys. 
Adolescent girls who were teased

about their weight at baseline 
were at approximately twice the 
risk of being overweight 5 years 
later. 
37 A 10-year longitudinal 
study found that the prevalence 
of weight teasing did not 
decrease as children matured 
into young adults, despite 
the fact that the relationship 
between bullying and obesity 
had received a great deal of 
attention in the news. 
53 A group 
of subjects who were studied in 
their young teenage years were 
studied again in young adulthood 
to evaluate the role of hurtful 
weight-related comments and 
eating behaviors (n = 1902; mean 
age: 25 years). For both males 
and females, hurtful weight-
related comments from family 
members and significant others 
were associated with the use 
of unhealthy weight-control 
behaviors and binge eating in 
both males and females. 
54
5. Healthy body image. 
Approximately half of teenage 
girls and one-quarter of teenage 
boys are dissatisfied with their 
bodies; these numbers are higher 
in overweight teenagers. 
55 
Body dissatisfaction is a known 
risk factor for both EDs and 
disordered eating; higher scores 
of body dissatisfaction are 
associated with more dieting 
and unhealthy weight-control 
behaviors in both boys and 
girls, reduced physical activity 
in girls, and more binge eating 
in boys. 
56 Body dissatisfaction 
and disordered eating occur in 
minority populations and are not 
limited to white girls and boys. 
57 
Adolescents who were more 
satisfied with their bodies were 
more likely to report parental and 
peer attitudes that encouraged 
healthful eating and exercising 
to be fit, rather than dieting; they 
were less likely to report personal 
weight-related concerns and 
behaviors. 
58
MI IS USEFUL IN ADDRESSING WEIGHT-
RELATED ISSUES
MI was developed by Miller and 
Rollnick in 1991 to treat patients 
with addiction. Although MI has 
been well studied in adults with 
addictions and obesity, fewer studies 
have evaluated the effect of MI on 
patients with EDs and the use of MI in 
children and adolescents. 
59 
– 
61 Studies 
to date on the use of MI for patients 
with EDs 
60, 
61 and for children and 
adolescents with obesity have been 
promising. 
62 
 
– 
65 The most recent 
book on MI by Miller and Rollnick 
defines MI as “a collaborative, goal-
oriented style of communication 
with particular attention to the 
language of change. It is designed 
to strengthen personal motivation 
for and commitment to a specific 
goal by eliciting and exploring the 
person’s own reasons for change 
within an atmosphere of acceptance 
and compassion.”66 This counseling 
approach involves 4 broad processes 
listed in  
Table 2. 
67
A study conducted through the AAP 
Pediatric Research in Office Settings 
(PROS) network assessed the effect 
of MI delivered by pediatricians 
and found that pediatricians and 
dietitians who used MI to counsel 
families with overweight children 
were successful in reducing 
children’s BMI percentile by 3.1 more 
points than a control group in which 
MI was not used. 
68 The AAP Web 
and mobile app called “Change Talk: 
Childhood Obesity” (http:// 
ihcw. 
aap. 
org/ 
resources) uses an interactive 
virtual practice environment to train 
pediatricians about the basics of 
MI. Pediatricians can successfully 
facilitate their patients’ lifestyle 
behavior changes. Concerns from 
pediatricians and parents that 
obesity counseling can lead to an ED 
can be addressed by understanding 
the effectiveness of family-centered 
MI to promote healthy behaviors.
WHAT TO DO IF AN ED IS SUSPECTED
The pediatrician often is the first 
professional consulted by a parent or 
the school when there is a concern 
about a possible ED. Height, weight, 
and BMI should be plotted on the 
2000 growth charts available from 
the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention (www. 
cdc. 
gov/ 
growthcharts), and the current data 
should be compared with as many 
previous data points as possible. 
A BMI below the fifth percentile is 
underweight and may indicate an 
ED. Other possible indicators of an 
ED include missed menstrual periods 
in girls, an unusually rapid decline 
in BMI, or engaging in disordered 
eating behaviors by normal-weight 
and overweight adolescents who are 
dissatisfied with their body image. 
Early diagnosis and intervention are 
associated with improved outcome. 
69 
EDs are best evaluated and managed 
by a multidisciplinary health care 
team, with the pediatrician as an 
important member of that team. 
70 
A thorough physical examination 
and review of systems can help to 
identify any underlying medical 
and psychiatric causes for weight 
loss. This comprehensive clinical 
assessment has been described in 
detail elsewhere. 
5 High-risk eating 
and activity behaviors and clinical 
findings of concern are outlined 
in  
Table 3. The pediatrician may 
feel comfortable performing this 
evaluation or may prefer to refer 
the patient to a specialized ED 
center, if one is available in the

local community. A psychological 
assessment by a mental health 
professional can assist with the 
evaluation for comorbid psychiatric 
illnesses (eg, affective or anxiety 
disorders).
In children and adolescents with 
AN and BN, family-based therapy 
(FBT), in which the parents control 
the refeeding process, has been 
shown to be an effective first-line 
method of treatment. 
71, 
 
72 With FBT, 
the pediatrician can assist with 
monitoring the patient for weight 
gain and vital sign stability and 
can communicate with the patient, 
family, and therapist. Becoming 
familiar with the general principles 
of FBT can assist the pediatrician in 
understanding his or her role in this 
form of treatment ( 
Table 4).

AN INTEGRATED APPROACH TO 
OBESITY AND ED PREVENTION 
FOCUSES ON HEALTHY FAMILY-BASED 
LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION
Obesity prevention and treatment, 
if conducted correctly, does not 
predispose to EDs. On the contrary, 
randomized controlled trials of 
obesity prevention programs have 
shown a reduction in the use of self-
induced vomiting or diet pill use 
to control weight 
74 and a decrease 
in concerns about weight in the 
intervention groups. 
75
Family involvement in the treatment 
of both adolescent obesity and EDs 
has been determined to be more 
effective than an adolescent-only 
focus. 
73, 
 
76 An integrated approach 
to the prevention of obesity and EDs 
focuses less on weight and more 
on healthy family-based lifestyle 
modification that can be sustained. 
Pediatricians can encourage 
parents to be healthy role models 
and supportively manage the food 
environment by creating easy 
accessibility to healthy foods (eg, 
fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans 
and other legumes, and water) and by 
limiting the availability of sweetened 
beverages, including those containing 
artificial sweeteners, and other foods 
containing refined carbohydrates. 
Discussions between pediatricians 
and parents about increasing 
physical activity and limiting the 
amount of total entertainment screen 
time to less than 2 hours/day are 
important and may lead to changes 
in family behavior. 
77 Another area of 
prevention is avoiding the presence 
of a television in the teenager’s 
bedroom, because having a television 
in the room predicts significantly less 
physical activity as well as poorer 
dietary intakes compared with not 
having a television in the room. 
78, 
79 
Other evidence-based approaches 
encourage parents to include more 
family meals, home-prepared meals, 
and meals with less distractions 
as well as fewer discussions about 
weight and about dieting. 
6, 
 
80 
Understanding that poor body image 
can lead to an ED, parents should 
avoid comments about body weight 
and discourage dieting efforts that 
may inadvertently result in EDs and 
body dissatisfaction.
ROLE OF THE PEDIATRICIAN IN THE 
PREVENTION OF OBESITY AND EDS IN 
ADOLESCENTS
Observations that can be concluded 
from current research summarized 
in this report to help prevent 
weight-related problems including 
both obesity and EDs include the 
following:
1. Discourage dieting, skipping of 
meals, or the use of diet pills; 
instead, encourage and support 
the implementation of healthy 
e6
TABLE 3  
High-Risk Eating and Activity Behaviors and Clinical Findings of Concern
High-risk eating and activity behaviors
 • Severe dietary restriction (<500 kcal/d)
 • Skipping of meals to lose weight
 • Prolonged periods of starvation
 • Self-induced vomiting
 • Use of diet pills, laxatives, or diuretics
 • Compulsive and excessive exercise
 • Social isolation, irritability, profound fear of gaining weight, body image distortion
Clinical fi
 ndings of concern
 • Rapid weight loss
 • Falling off percentiles for weight and BMI
 • Amenorrhea in girls
 • Presence of vital sign instability
  o Bradycardia (heart rate <50 beats/minute during the day)
  o Hypotension (<90/45 mm Hg)
  o Hypothermia (body temperature <96°F [<35.6°C])
  o Orthostasis (increase in pulse >20 beats/min) or decrease in blood pressure (>20 mm Hg systolic 
or >10 mm Hg diastolic) on standing
TABLE 4  
Principles of Family-Based Treatment of EDs and Role of the Pediatrician
Principles of treatment
 • Parents are not to blame
 • Parents are vital to therapeutic success
 • Parents are responsible for weight restoration
 • Separate the child from the illness
 • Nonauthoritarian approach
Three phases of treatment
 • Phase 1: parents restore patient’s weight
 • Phase 2: control transferred back to the child or adolescent
 • Phase 3: focuses on adolescent developmental issues and termination of treatment
Examples of the role the pediatrician can play
 • Act as a consultant to the parents and therapist
 • Explain the medical seriousness of the ED
 • Monitor and manage the medical status of the adolescent
 • Empower the parents in decision-making
 • Communicate with the patient, family, and therapist

eating and physical activity 
behaviors that can be maintained 
on an ongoing basis. The focus 
should be on healthy living and 
healthy habits rather than on 
weight.
2. Promote a positive body image 
among adolescents. Do not 
encourage body dissatisfaction or 
focus on body dissatisfaction as a 
reason for dieting.
3. Encourage more frequent family 
meals.
4. Encourage families not to talk 
about weight but rather to talk 
about healthy eating and being 
active to stay healthy. Do more at 
home to facilitate healthy eating 
and physical activity.
5. Inquire about a history of 
mistreatment or bullying in 
overweight and obese teenagers 
and address this issue with 
patients and their families.
6. Carefully monitor weight loss in 
an adolescent who needs to lose 
weight to ensure the adolescent 
does not develop the medical 
complications of semistarvation.
Time constraints in a busy pediatric 
practice are significant. Weight issues 
can be a topic of sensitivity and 
therefore can be time consuming. 
The evidence-based suggestions in 
this report can be implemented in 
relatively brief encounters and can be 
an excellent first step for teenagers 
and families to promote a healthy 
lifestyle.
