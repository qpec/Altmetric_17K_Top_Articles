Disorderly resolution of conflict is costly, whereas orderly resolution by consent rules enables
quick settlement. However, it is unclear whether non-human animals can make and observe
rules to resolve conflict without aggression. Here we report a new behavioral paradigm for
mice: a modified two-armed maze that uses wireless electrical brain stimulation as reward.
First, the mice were individually operant-trained to initiate and then receive the reward at the
signaled arm. Next, two mice were coupled and had to cooperate to initiate reward but then
to compete over reward allocation. Mice develop and observe a rule of reward zone allocation
that increases the total amount of reward and reward equity between the pair. In the mutual
rule-observance behavior, positive reciprocity and tolerance to the other’s violation are also
observed. These findings suggest that rodents can learn to make and observe rules to resolve
conflict, enhancing long-term benefit and payoff equity.

ocial conflict occurs when the available resources are
insufficient as animals compete to maximize individual
benefit1. Competition is a common and natural strategy that
nature favors2, yet competition is costly3 and stressful4. Costly
fighting is largely continued until one party submits, and coun-
terblows of the other are always risky. Worst of all, competitors
may both suffer severe injuries. One party may give up early to
save cost after rapid evaluation of the other’s potential in battle,
which may depend on size, appearance, experience and so on5,
but there is nothing to be gained in this scenario besides a likely
safer exit. In this sense, disorderly competition is often wasteful in
a society6.
In contrast, the orderly resolution of conflict by making and
observing rules (or conventions), could save costs and ultimately
increase mutual benefits. These social rules include examples as
the first to arrive is the first who is served/has the first choice, and
respect of ownership7. In game theory, such conflict resolution
has been called a ‘Bourgeois’ strategy8. In ecological systems, a
Bourgeois strategy is found in some species displaying territorial
ownership, e.g., butterfly, damselfly and social spiders9–12. In
these species, when an individual finds a prior resident in a new
territory, it retreats from the place, regardless of the resident’s
resource holding potential in battle. However, if it finds no resi-
dent, it occupies the place and then repels intruders, using
aggression if necessary. Repeated interaction between two indi-
viduals using the Bourgeois strategy corresponds to mutual rule-
observance. Such a strategy incurs little cost and distributes the
resources equally, if the role of resident/intruder is determined
stochastically during long-term interactions7, 8, and can resolve
conflicts quickly12.
Evolutionary studies have suggested that natural selection
favors individuals that use such strategies, thereby limiting
aggression and saving cost3. Resolving conflicts by using rules is
indeed often better than costly competition in terms of saving
cost7, and the Bourgeois strategy is one that can be dominant in
certain populations13, 14. Humans, for example, are a species that
utilizes the Bourgeois strategy, making and observing rules that
are learned in the course of socialization15. These learned stra-
tegies can then be transmitted generation by generation; yet when
the capacity to learn such rules evolved remains unknown16.
Thus, it is not known whether fellow mammals, such as rodents,
have the cognitive capability to develop the Bourgeois strategy
and, if they do, how such rule observance behavior is sponta-
neously learned during social conflict over limited rewards.
Impulsivity has been suggested as a factor that prohibits ani-
mals from learning higher-level cooperative resolution17–19. Non-
human animals are often impulsive and choose immediate,
smaller rewards rather than waiting for larger, future rewards; this
choice often leads them into potentially unnecessary conflict19.
Impulsive animals therefore find it difficult to learn mutual rule-
observance behavior, because it requires patience for potentially
uncertain long-term profits. On the other hand, it has been
argued that this observed impulsivity in animals is largely due to
heightened food-deprivation20. Food is essential for survival and
has been used as a primary reinforcement in animal experiments
and, therefore, food-deprived animals become impulsive and tend
to choose immediate rewards. Moreover, computer simulations
suggest that cooperative self-reinforcing solutions can be pro-
duced in social conflict as long as the individuals involved possess
a sufficient ability to learn such rules21. Put another way, indi-
viduals who are cognitively able to will develope and adopt simple
behavioral rules, such as habits, rituals, routines and norms, when
these rules are beneficial22. Yet it remains unclear whether non-
human animals, such as mice, can spontaneously learn to adopt
this Bourgeois strategy to save time, energy or other conflict-
induced costs12.
Here, we establish a new assay to investigate the emergence of
interactive social behavior in mice. This behavioral paradigm
required mice to first be trained on an operant conditioning
paradigm in a two-armed maze, with wireless deep-brain sti-
mulation into the medial forebrain bundle as a reward. Then, two
mice were paired and had to share the same space to initiate the
reward. However, the reward was only received by the mouse who
reached the end of the arm, the reward zone, first, and could be
disrupted by the entry of the other mouse into this same zone.
Our results show that these mice settle the potential social conflict
induced by this design by developing and observing the rule of
reward zone allocation. More specifically, each mouse in the pair
prefers one of the two reward zones, and lets their partner
experience the reward in the non-preferred side. This behavior
results in a maximization of the total amount of reward, as well as
ensuring that the two mice are rewarded approximately equally.
Taken together, these results suggest that mice in social conflict
are able to develop and follow rules that enhance their long-term
benefit.
Results
Wireless brain stimulation effectively trains mice to seek reward.
The aim of this study was to investigate whether or not mice can
learn to make and observe rules that allow them to resolve con-
flict over limited rewards in an orderly fashion. To do so, we
developed an operant system that utilizes wireless electrical brain
stimulation (WBS) as reward (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1).
Electrical brain stimulation has been previously used in animal
operant conditioning23–25; it has an incentive salience24, and
rarely induces satiation, unlike food23. Importantly, it does not
require animals to be deprived of food, which is thought to make
animals impulsive20.
The WBS headset was small (1.5 × 1.5 cm) and lightweight (1.2
g), and generated an electrical current when it sensed an infrared
signal from the external controller. The WBS headset was
connected to a bipolar electrode that was implanted into a part of
the reward circuitry in the brain, the medial forebrain bundle24, 25
(Supplementary Fig. 2). We chose mice (C57BL/6J) as the subject
species, because they possess measurable levels of social traits and
learning ability26, 27, and because they are a representative
mammalian species.
First, we compared the conditioning efficacy and provocation
of aggression between a WBS- and food-reward condition. Mice
in the food reward condition were food-deprived (see Methods),
while those in the WBS-reward condition were not. We
conditioned individual mice in a two-armed maze that was
operated in a self-directed manner, and thus enabled spontaneous
learning and performance (Fig. 1b). Briefly, the two-armed maze
consisted of three zones: a central zone (start zone); a left zone
(reward zone); and a right zone (reward zone). A mouse could
initiate a round by entering the start zone, which activated a
visual cue (blue light) to randomly denote the reward zone, which
could be either the left zone or the right zone, The frequency of
the designated zones was counterbalanced (left zone: right zone =
0.5:0.5). We utilized a food-pellet (20 mg) for the food-reward
condition and five-second WBS for the WBS-reward condition
(Supplementary Movies 1 and 2).
The WBS reward was found to be a very effective positive
reinforcement for the operant training, as shown by the steeper
learning curve (Fig. 1c) and the faster movement toward the
reward zone in response to the cue (Fig. 1d; one-way ANOVA on
ranks, Dunn’s correction, *P < 0.05, n = 15, 50, 11, for food-,
WBS-, sham-WBS group, respectively), compared to those of the
sham-WBS control group. Next, we selected the mice that had
successfully obtained reward. These mice performed at 75% above

 chance (which was determined using a binomial test, with
maximum trial number, 20; probability value, 0.5; criterion value,
P < 0.05) and performance was based on the mean value of
correct choice percentage throughout last three sessions. These
criteria ensured that the mice were well trained. We then placed
pairs (five pairs for food-reward group, 19 pairs for the WBS
group) of well-conditioned mice in an open field for 30 min to
observe their spontaneous aggressive interactions, such as
chasing, biting, poking and mounting28. Pairs from the WBS
condition showed shorter periods of aggression, whereas pairs
from the food condition exhibited longer periods of aggression
(Fig. 1e, t-test, *P < 0.05 and Supplementary Movies 3 and 4).
These results indicate that, for this operant conditioning task,
WBS is efficient as a reward and does not provoke much
aggressive behavior
Aggressive behavior is not shown in the mice over WBS
reward. To examine how two mice resolve conflict over limited
resources, we conducted a ‘conflict resolution test’ (Fig. 2a). We
put two well-conditioned mice in the same two-way maze, and
motivated them to move quickly toward the denoted zone to
obtain reward exclusively—i.e., based on winner-take-all para-
digm. Briefly, pairs in the WBS condition could initiate a round
only by entering the start-zone together. Then the visual-cue
randomly denoted the reward-zone (counterbalanced between the
two arms). WBS was immediately provided to any mouse that
reached the denoted zone first. Unless the other mouse entered
this zone, the first-comer received WBS for 5 s (we call this an
intact round). However, if the other, late arriving mouse also
entered the zone, we instantly stopped WBS, thereby finishing the
round (we call this a disrupted round).
Regardless of the outcome of a round (i.e., intact or disrupted),
the two mice could start the next round by re-entering the central
zone together. Each pair of mice could repeat rounds up to 40
times in a session (which lasted for 20 min), and a given pair of
mice performed 20 sessions over 20 days, i.e., one session per day.
The conflict resolution test in the food condition was structured
similarly to that in the WBS condition, except that a round was
finished right after the food pellet was dispensed. The food
condition experiment had no separation of intact vs. disrupted
round because it was physically impossible in this set-up.
In this conflict resolution test, we first observed that the
number of rounds increased with experience in both conditions
(WBS reward group, from 16.84 ± 1.33 rounds to 33.16 ± 1.80
rounds; Food reward group, from 14.00 ± 1.14 rounds to 33.80 ±
3.06 rounds, mean ± S.E.M., Fig. 2b), indicating that mice
successfully learned how to initiate a round together. Next, we
found that aggression was observed in 57% of sessions in the food
condition, and only in 8% of the sessions in the WBS condition,
and the amount of time showing aggression in the food condition
was significantly longer than that of the WBS condition
(Mann–Whitney Rank Sum Test, P = 0.005, Fig. 2c). In the food
condition, for example, one dominant mouse occasionally pushed
the submissive mouse to the start zone at the beginning of a run,
or attacked the submissive mouse when the submissive mouse

 took the pellet (Supplementary Movie 5), resulting in the
establishment of hierarchy and an unequal distribution of food
(Supplementary Fig. 3). In the WBS condition, however,
aggression was rarely observed (seen only in 31 sessions out of
380 sessions, and only occurring 47 times throughout the
31 sessions, Fig. 2c and Supplementary Movie 6). These
observations suggest that the mice often resolved conflict over
the limited rewards by aggression in the food condition, but did
not use aggression to solve the conflict in the WBS condition.
Mice develop and observe a rule of reward zone allocation.
How did the mice resolve conflict over the limited WBS without
aggression? To understand this better, first, we made pixel-based
representation of the reward zone occupation rate by the two
competing mice through the twenty sessions for each of the 19
pairs (Fig. 3a). In the early sessions, two mice in a pair competed
for both of the reward zones. Eventually, however, the two mice
showed a split behavior: when the left zone was denoted by the
light cue, one mouse predominantly occupied the left zone. We
called this mouse as ML. When the light cue denoted the right
zone, the other mouse (called MR) predominantly occupied the
right reward zone. As a result, ‘reward zone allocation’ was
established. The time for establishing this reward zone allocation
greatly varied among the pairs, with some pairs never reaching
that level. For further analysis, we picked the pair #8, which

 gradually developed the reward zone allocation, as a representa-
tive pair, and generated a space occupancy map for three different
time points of a trial (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 7). We
compared these space maps for the earlier sessions (Quarter 1,
sessions 1–5) and later sessions (Quarter 4, sessions 16–20). This
pictorial presentation of the occupancy map clearly showed that
the reward zone allocation was well established in Quarter 4.
Once their preferred zones were determined, when the left zone
was lit up and taken by ML, MR mostly stayed in the start-zone or
in few cases ran toward its own side (the right side) which was
unlit (Fig. 3b); ML, the partner mouse, behaved similarly in
rounds with the opposite situation. To show the gradual devel-
opment of reward zone allocation, we plotted the mean value of
the differential occupation of each reward zone by the two mice
throughout the sessions. For ZL, number of occupation by ML—
number of occupation by MR. For ZR, in the opposite direction
(Fig. 3c). The two mice behaved as if they used the light cue for
allocating the reward zones and taking turns in reward reception.
We
defined
this
observed
behavior
of
the
mice
as
‘rule-observance’:
neither
a
preemptive-occupation
nor
a
reward-disruption when the opponent received reward in its
preferred zone. Preoccupancy or reward-disruption under the
same condition was defined as ‘rule-violation’ (Fig. 4a). We
successfully identified mice performing rule-observance (MObs)
above chance level using the binomial test (maximum trial
number, 40; probability value, 0.5; criterion value, P < 0.05). The
other mice were regarded as rule-violation mice (MVio, binomial
test, P > 0.05).
One important prerequisite to conclude that this behavior is
rule-observance rather than simple learning is to show that mice
are capable of perceiving that the amount of reward is reduced
when their competitor/partner enters the reward zone. To
confirm that mice do indeed associate the presence of a
conspecific with a decrease in reward, we carried out a control
experiment with a modified protocol that was the same as the
initial
experiment
except that
the WBS
reward
was not
discontinued when the competitor/partner mouse entered the
reward zone (Supplementary Fig. 4a). The greatest difference in
the behavioral pattern generated by these two protocols is
observed at the reward termination, especially in the later
sessions: Essentially all 40 trials end with the two mice within
the reward zone (Supplementary Fig. 4b). Furthermore, only the
pairs that went through the modified protocol (eight pairs)
reached the maximum trial number per session (40 trials within
20 min) while none of the pairs in the main protocol (19 pairs)
did (two-way repeated measure (RM) analysis of variance
(ANOVA), F1,25 = 6.681, P = 0.016, Holm–Sidak post hoc test,
P < 0.05, Supplementary Fig. 4c). These differences in the
animals’ behavior between the two protocols suggest that, in
the original protocol in which the presence of a conspecific could
disrupt the reward, both mice were able to perceive that
disrupting the others’ reward would result in a diminished

 amount of the reward. This perception may have driven them to
establish the rule observance behavior, which in turn allowed
them to mutually enhance the amount of time each one got to
experience the reward.
The proportion of MObs was 60% of all mice (23/38). We
plotted the level of rule-observance of ML and MR in a two-
dimensional graph along with the binomial test result (Fig. 4b).
This shows the presence of three separable sub-groups under the
WBS conditions: mutual rule-observance pairs (MObs and MObs),
mutual rule-violation pairs (MVio and MVio), and mixed pairs
(MObs and MVio).
Rule-observance enhances long-term benefit and payoff equity.
Why did 60% of mice use the rule observance strategy to resolve
conflict over limited rewards and what would be the potential
advantages of the this rule observance vs. violating this rule? To
address
this
issue,
we
investigated
whether
mutual
rule-
observance enhanced the amount of acquired reward (i.e.,
WBS) in a pair. We found that the degree of rule-observance in a
pair was positively associated with the amount of acquired WBS
in the pair (R = 0.73, ***P < 0.001, Pearsons’ R, Fig. 4c). In
addition, we compared MObs in mutual rule-observance pairs
with MVio in mutual rule-violation pairs on the following para-
meters. MObs clearly increased the frequency of rule-observance
over time, indicating that rule-observance was learned in this
group of mice, whereas MVio did not (One-way RM ANOVA,
quarter, F3,45 = 26.4, P < 0.001, Fig. 4d). The WBS acquisition in
MObs, but not in MVio, showed a significant rise over training
time, (One-way RM ANOVA, quarter, F3,45 = 69.9, P < 0.001,
Fig. 4e). The rise of WBS acquisition in MObs was likely due to an
increase in the number of rounds they played. In fact,
MObs–MObs pairs took part in the increased number of rounds
throughout the sessions and finally were able to participate in
twice as many rounds 2.26 ± 0.15 rounds/min) as MVio–MVio
pairs (1.39 ± 0.32 rounds/min) for a given period of time (One-
way RM ANOVA, quarter, F3,21 = 57.1, P < 0.001, Fig. 4f).
In addition, we determined how the mutual rule observance
strategy influenced the degree of payoff equity between the two
mice participating this conflict resolution test. To do this, we
calculated the reward acquisition ratio of the mouse that obtained
less over the other mouse that obtained more. If two mice had
acquired rewards equally during the test, the payoff equity value
becomes close to 1. We found that the payoff equity value
significantly increased from the third session (0.52 ± 0.07, mean
± S.E.M.) to the 20th, final, session (0.82 ± 0.04) (open circle,

d.f. = 19,
P < 0.001, Supplementary Fig. 3). Moreover, the proportion of
rule observance in a pair was positively associated with the payoff
equity: the mutual rule-observance pairs achieved the highest
level of payoff equity (>0.9) (R = 0.83, ***P < 0.001, Pearson’s R,
Fig. 4g). This finding strongly suggests that mutual rule-
observance is an efficient way to achieve high payoff equity in
conflict over limited rewards.
Rule violation behavior also evolved over the course of the
sessions. A common pattern was observed in pair types that
included Mobs. The mean value of the actual number of pre-
emptive occupation decreased gradually (1.16 ± 0.19 trials in the
first quarter, 0.8 ± 0.05 trials in the last quarter) and the
proportion of violation through disruption decreased (first
quarter 35.19%, last quarter 19.27%), while rule-observance
increased throughout the sessions (5.2 ± 0.50 trials in the first
quarter, 15.05 ± 0.20 trials in the last quarter, Fig. 4h and
Supplementary Fig. 5).
Finally, we examined whether differences in traits between the
two mice—including body weight, familiarity and learning ability
—were associated with the level of payoff equity in the WBS
condition; however, none of them showed a significant associa-
tion with payoff equity (R = − 0.26; Mann–Whitney Rank Sum
Test, P = 0.899; R = −0.15, Supplementary Fig. 6).
Position of the mouse pair during reward distribution. Con-
sidering that rule-observance behavior requires one mouse to
abstain from disrupting the other’s reward (based on territory),
the behavior of the mice who did not receive the reward while
their partners receive reward is the key for establishing rule-
observance. To understand the evolution of territory establish-
ment in MObs–MObs pairs compared to MVio–MVio pairs, we
analyzed the position of the mouse who did not receive the
reward at the time point when the WBS reward was initiated or
terminated to their partner (for the last five trials only; see Sup-
plementary Table 2, Supplementary Fig. 7). At reward initiation
in MObs–MObs pairs, the majority of the opponents remained in
the center zone (86.0 ± 2.5%) and very few moved into the correct
arm (2.0 ± 0.5%). At reward termination, 5 s later, a large

 proportion of the mice who were staying in the center area moved
out into the arms. Interestingly, the majority of them moved into
the incorrect arm, thereby staying away from the correct arm in
which their partner was receiving the reward. In contrast, the
majority of opponents in the MVio–MVio pairs at reward initiation
time were in the correct arm (56.4 ± 15.1%). At the reward ter-
mination time, even more mice were positioned in the correct
arm (65.4 ± 13.3%). Taken together, these results imply that the
rule-observant mice exerted an active effort not to disrupt their
partner’s reward.
Mutual rule-observance is strategic not habitual. To test whe-
ther mutual rule-observance was strategic or arose from a habi-
tual preference for one side of the two-armed set up, we shuffled
rodent pairs exhibiting mutual rule-observance: two MLs (or

 MRs) were chosen from two different MObs–MObs pairs and
performed another 20 session of the conflict resolution test
(Fig. 5a). In psychology and human neuroscience, a flexible and
immediate adaption of one’s behavior to a suddenly changed rule
is called rapid rule-transfer29. In these re-organized pairs, the
degree of rule-observance increased more rapidly compared to
the learning curve of the original pairs (two-way RM ANOVA,
F19,209 = 3.445, P < 0.001, Holm–Sidak post hoc test, *P < 0.05,
Fig. 5b). As this is similar to rapid rule transfer in humans, we call
this phenomenon rapid rule-transfer29. This finding suggests that
the mice adopted mutual rule-observance due to strategic reasons
rather than habits.
Tolerance and reciprocity in mutual rule-observance behavior.
Despite the higher profitability of cooperative, rule-observance
behavior, it is potentially vulnerable to violation or mistake. We
investigated whether reciprocity was present in the mutual rule-
observance strategy we observed in our mice. Mice may mirror
each others’ behaviors (i.e., tit-for-tat strategy)30 or be tolerant of
mistakes that their partner may make31. Reciprocity would best
be shown in two successive rounds where the direction of cue
alternated, (~60% of all rounds). In these sorted rounds, we
estimated the negative reciprocity (p(vio|vio*)), that is, the
number of cases in which one mouse showed rule-violation (vio)
after the other mouse exhibited rule-violation in the previous
round (vio*) over two successive rounds where the direction of
cue alternated. This analysis revealed that MObs showed a
decreased p(vio|vio*) from 0.59 ± 0.05 in the beginning to
0.23 ± 0.03 to the end, i.e., an increased tolerance; MVio on the
other hand, exhibited a high level of p(vio|vio*) through training
until the end (MObs pairs, one-way RM ANOVA, quarter,
F3,45 = 12.8, P < 0.001, Fig. 6a). This result shows that MObs
behaved tolerantly during their partner’s reward even after a trial
in which that same partner disrupted its own reward. This pro-
vides further evidence that these mice adopted a Bourgeois
strategy.
We calculated the probability of positive reciprocity (p(obs|
obs*)) using the same logic. We found that MObs had increased p
(obs|obs*) from 0.38 ± 0.05 in the beginning to 0.72 ± 0.03 at the
end of training, whereas MVio retained the low level of p(obs|
obs*) throughout the trials (MObs pairs, One-way RM ANOVA,
quarter, F3,45 = 19.8, P < 0.001, Fig. 6b). Furthermore, to quantify
the stability of the rule-observance behavior, we looked at the
mice who showed positive reciprocity in a preceding unrewarded
trial, to see how they behaved in an immediately following,
unrewarded trial (obs**). The probability of persistent positive
reciprocity (p(obs|obs**)) of MObs was significantly higher than
that of MVio (two-way RM ANOVA, F1,24 = 252.30, P < 0.0001,
Fig. 6c). This finding indicates that positive reciprocity behavior
was stable in the mutual rule-observance pairs.
Discussion
Non-human animals are thought to be impulsive, often choosing
immediate reward even if it results in conflict, thereby failing to
resolve potential social conflicts rationally18, 19. Here we have
shown that mice find an orderly resolution to social conflict over
limited rewards by making and observing the rule of ‘reward zone
allocation’. The current study further shows that this cooperative,
rule-observance behavior is learned by both mice in a pair,
thereby enhancing the long-term benefit and payoff equity for
both mice. Thus, our study suggests that rule-observance beha-
vior is a powerful, higher-level mechanism for conflict resolution,
and suggests that mice can use it in addition to the well-
established lower-level strategies, such as hierarchy, threat-dis-
play, ritual and war of attrition5.
Research in game theory has shown that the orderly resolution
of conflict by establishing and observing rules may eventually
increase mutual benefits. Here, we see that the rule-observing
mice gradually increased their tolerance and positive reciprocity
towards their partners, while the mice who did not observe these
rules also did not develop either tolerance or reciprocity. This
rule-observing behavior seen in these mice may correspond to the
Bourgeois strategy, as defined by classical game theory. Futher-
more, we show that mice persistently observe this established rule
even when the partner is rewarded in consecutive times, i.e., in a
situation that is more costly for that mouse. Such results suggest
that rule-observance behavior is stable once established. Con-
sidering the low positive reciprocity of MVio, it was surprising to
see that the probability of persistent rule-observance behavior in
MVio was higher than 0.5 and even increased throughout the
sessions. These MVio mice represent a subgroup of the tested
sample who showed rule-observance in the previous round. In
other words, there is heterogeneity among MVio in rule-obser-
vance/violation behavior. In addition, the total rule-observance
behavior of MVio increased slightly throughout the sessions. This
suggests that MVio may also be able to learn rule-observance,
albeit at a much slower rate than MObs.
The novel paradigm we use to demonstrate this behavior
should be developed further to allow for future studies on diverse
cognitive/social behavioral questions, for example, to investigate
how familiarity between a pair affects their rule-observance
behavior, how the asymmetry of the amount of reward between
the two arms affects the behavior, or what will happen to the rule-
observance behavior of the trained mice when there is only one
reward zone available. Moreover, diverse tools available for stu-
dies in the mouse should allow further research on the brain
mechanisms underlying different stages of the behaviors involved
in this assay.
In conclusion, here we show that mice in potential conflict over
a limited reward can develop and observe the rule of reward zone
allocation, thereby enhancing each individual mouse’s benefit and
payoff equity. These mice also show tolerance and positive reci-
procity toward the partner’s behavior, requiring active efforts not
to disrupt their partner’s reward.
Methods
Mice. Male C57BL/6J mice were used for the current study. Four or five mice were
housed together in a cage under a 12:12 light-dark cycle. During the time, food and
water were accessible ad libitum. Mice were provided by the animal facilities in the
Institute for Basic Science, Daejeon, Korea. All animal studies and experimental
procedures were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Institute
for Basic Science, Daejeon, Korea.
Stereotaxic surgery. At the 11th week in age, stereotaxic surgery to implant a
bipolar electrode (MS303T/2-B/SPC, Plastics One, Roanoke, Virginia) onto the
right medial forebrain bundle (+1.2; −1.2; −5, AP; ML; DV, in millimeter from the
bregma) was performed. Ketamine (120 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) was
administered to anesthetize mice before the stereotaxic surgery. After the electrode
implantation, each mouse was housed alone until the end of behavioral test.
Location of electrode was confirmed after sacrifice. After 1-week recovery from
surgery, food was restricted in the food-group, which was randomly destributed
among all mice. Care was given to keep mice body weight above 85% of the
reference body weight, as measured 1 day before food-restriction. The reference
body weight of mice was 27.6 ± 0.41 g (mean ± S.E.M.). In our animal care system,
supplying food as much as 10% of reference body weight after a session of behavior
test was sufficient to maintain target body weight. The average body weight during
the food-restriction was 25.4 ± 0.45 g, equivalent to 92% of the reference body
weight. For the WBS-group, ad libitum feeding was applied.
Apparatus and materials. The WBS system was primarily comprised of an
infrared pulse emitter and a lightweight WBS-headset (1.2 g). First, a home-made
electrical pulse generator sent pulse signal onto an infrared emitting diode (SIR-
568ST3F, Rohm, Kyoto, Japan). Peak light emitting wavelength of the diode was
850 nm and the luminous output was 13 mW. Second, the WBS-headset sensed the
infrared light signal through an infrared light sensitive phototransistor (RPT-

 34PB3F, Rohm, Kyoto, Japan; 750–900 nm in spectral length). The WBS-headset
transformed the sensed infrared light pulse into electrical pulse. Finally, the
transformed electrical pulse was delivered to the medial forebrain bundle through
the pre-implanted bipolar electrode. The headset was set to charge maximum 6.2 V
onto brain tissue with impedance over 47 KΩ by installing a Zener diode (break-
down voltage, 6.2 V) and a resistor (R, 47 KΩ). Brain tissue impedance was over 47
KΩ in all mice. The average impedance was 115 ± 4 KΩ. In current study, we used
five trains of infrared pulses to generate one time of WBS reward. Each train was
generated every second. The number of pulses in a train was 30. A light pulse was
given for 0.2 ms with10-ms interval. The total length of a train was 0.3 s and resting
time between two trains was 0.7 s. Corresponding to the light pulses, the WBS-
headset generated five trains of electrical pulses. An individual electrical pulse was
1 ms long (from rise to half-decay) and 6.2 V in peak amplitude. The headset
operated by a 12 V rechargeable battery pack (a serial connection of four ML-414,
Panasonic, Japan). A red or green light-emitting diode (LED) -indicator was
attachable onto the WBS-headset. We used LEDs to detect the location of mice.
Behavioral study design. In our operant conditioning box, a two-armed maze (50
cm × 50 cm × 30 cm, width × depth × height), a camera, an automatic color detec-
tion software, two blue LEDs, a speaker, two micro-pellet dispensers and the WBS-
reward system were equipped. The two-armed maze was made by dividing an open
field arena into three sections through the use of two transparent partitions. We
virtually set a start zone in the central section (body) and two payoff zones in the
left/right sections (two arms). The camera and the color detection software enabled
us to monitor the location of the mouse inside the two-armed maze continuously.
Through the location information, we controlled the function of components. Two
blue LEDs were placed beside the payoff zones. Micro-pellet dispensers were also
fixed adjacent to the payoff zones. The infrared pulse emitters for the WBS-reward
system was installed on the ceiling of the operant conditioning box above 40 cm
from the bottom.
We defined one trial as one chance to obtain a payoff. The trial was initiated
when the freely moving mouse entered into the start zone. One of two blue LED
was turned on to denote the correct-choice zone, where a positive reward would be
supplied. If the mouse chose the denoted zone (correct choice), a micro-pellet (20
mg, F0163, BioServ, NJ, USA) was provided to mice in the food-group (n = 15). 5 s
of WBS-reward was given to mice in the WBS-group (n = 50). During WBS-reward
delivery, if the mouse leaves the reward zone and re-enters without disruption by
the opponent, it would receive the stimulation for the remaining reward duration.
For Sham-WBS-group, the headset was switched off, although the IR signal was
provided as for WBS-reward group (n = 11). In the case that mice chose the unlit
payoff zone (incorrect-choice zone), a negative reinforcement (loud tone, 75 dB,
0.5 s) was given. After the mouse received the reward, the trial was terminated and
the operant conditioning system returned to idle state.
Unlike the freezing behavior demonstrated in response to fear, there are no
simple behavioral markers for quantifying reward in mice. We can only tell
whether mice prefer a longer reward to a shorter reward by comparing the time
they visit the two reward zones with different duration of IR lighting time. In the
preliminary experiments where we try to establish the stimulation reward protocol,
we found that mice chose the longer over shorter stimulation reward: 6 s over 2 s
(n = 10), or 6 s over 4 s (n = 10), conforming to ‘the matching rule’. We could
interpret these results that they can distinguish the different durations of the
stimulus, and thus perceive them as different amounts of reward (Supplementary
Table 1).
A daily training session allowed the mouse maximum 20 trials within 40 min.
The denotation side was counterbalanced and randomized by pseudo-random
sequences, which was designed to prevent four successive cues in a side. We
prepared 10 sequences and each sequence was used every 10 days. This
experimental system was fully automated from cue-presentation to rewarding to
minimize the interruption by researchers during the test.
We evaluated the performance of each mouse by two criteria: a well-trained
mouse should achieve the maximum number of trials during the last three sessions
(60 trials) and the number of correct choices during that period should be over 45
(binomial test, 20 trials, 0.5 of probability, P < 0.001). In the food-group, mice were
trained for 30 sessions and 11 out of 15 (73%) passed the criteria. In the WBS-
group, 38 out of 50 (76%) passed the criteria in 20 sessions. In Sham-WBS-group,
no mice passed this criterion.
Regarding pellet priming, the same micro-pellet was used before the operant
conditioning. We put six micro-pellets in front of the two food-dispensers and
exposed each mouse into the maze for 30 min. We repeated the priming until the
mouse consumed all pellets inside the maze. Five days were sufficient for pellet
priming.
In the WBS conditioning, almost all mice stayed in the correct-choice zone
while the WBS was continuing. In the early period, some mice occasionally came
out from the payoff zone while the WBS was continuing. That behavior was usually
disappeared in a few trials in well-trained mice. As a consequence of operant
conditioning, five pairs for the food-group and 19 pairs for the WBS-group were
prepared. In pairing, response time for reward, the time from the start zone to the
payoff zone, was considered primarily. We averaged the response times in the last
three sessions. By the value, all mice were ranked by descending order and we
paired every two mice from above. In the food-group, the response time of 10 well-
trained mice was 7.3 ± 0.84 (mean ± S.E.M., in seconds). The difference in response
time between mice in pair was 1.3 ± 0.57 s. In the WBS-group, the response time of
38 well-trained mice 4.4 ± 0.40 s. The difference in response time was 0.54 ± 0.14 s.
In the conflict resolution test, two well-trained mice were put in the same arena
where those were trained. There are three additional rules in this test, as follows:
First, the incorrect-choice condition was removed. If any mouse visited the unlit
zone during a trial, no tone was given and the trial just continued. Second, a trial
was initiated by a joint action, where two mice should be at the start zone together.
Third, there was the disruption condition in WBS-group, in which one of the mice
could disrupt their partners’ reward by entering the reward zone. The mice were
wearing one of two different colored headset (red or green) during the test. To
measure the payoff, we counted the number of pellets each mouse consumed.
Occasionally, the late mouse snatched the pellet that the first-comer was holding in
its front paws. In such cases, the pellet was attributed to the late mouse. In the
WBS-group, the time spent receiving the WBS in the payoff zone was measured. In
the trials in which the other mouse stayed out the payoff zone, the rewarding time
was 5 s. However, in the case of a disruption, only the duration from reward
initiation to the onset of disruption was considered. Rarely, the first-comer
temporarily left the payoff zone and re-entered within the maximum 5-second
potential WBS-reward. In this case, we did not deduct the time that the first-comer
was outside the reward zone.
To quantify the length of aggressive interactions, we measured the distance
between two mice. We extracted video sections that the distance between two mice
was less than 7 cm for over 3 s (first selections). Among the first selections, we
manually identified sections that contained chasing, biting, pushing, poking or
mounting (these we call second selections). In the case of two adjacent video
sections that were thought to be fractions of a continuous action, we merged the
two. Three observers participated in the manual second selection and were blinded
to the experiment. To refine the second selections, three observers who did not
participate in the behavioral experiment manually reconfirmed the video clips.
In WBS-group, seven pairs were made: two mice were housed together until
11th week in age, just before the surgery (familiar pairs). Twelve pairs were made
with mice from different cages (unfamiliar pairs).
Data analysis. We analyzed our data using Matlab. There are no statistical
methods for pre-determination of sample sizes, but we employed similar sample
sizes to those that are generally accepted in the field. All statistical tests were non-
parametric and two-tailed.
Data availability. The data supporting this study are available from the corre-
sponding author for reasonable request. The computer code (MATLAB code) used
