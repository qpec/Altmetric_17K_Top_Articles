Abstract
This study aimed to establish whether vigorous-intensity exercise offers addi-
tional adipose-related health benefits and metabolic improvements compared
to energy-matched moderate-intensity exercise. Thirty-eight sedentary over-
weight men (n = 24) and postmenopausal women (n = 14) aged 52 � 5 years
(mean � standard deviations [SD]) were prescribed a 3-week energy deficit
(29302 kJ∙week�1) achieved by increased isocaloric moderate or vigorous-
intensity exercise (+8372 kJ∙week�1) and simultaneous restricted energy intake
(�20930 kJ∙week�1). Participants were randomly assigned to either an energy-
matched vigorous (VIG; n = 18) or moderate (MOD; n = 20) intensity exercise
group (five times per week at 70% or 50% maximal oxygen uptake, respec-
tively). At baseline and follow-up, fasted blood samples and abdominal subcu-
taneous adipose tissue biopsies were obtained and oral glucose tolerance tests
conducted. Body mass was reduced similarly in both groups (Δ 2.4 � 1.1 kg
and Δ 2.4 � 1.4 kg, respectively, P < 0.05). Insulinemic responses to a stan-
dard glucose load decreased similarly at follow-up relative to baseline in VIG
(Δ 8.6 � 15.4 nmol.120 min.l�1) and MOD (Δ 5.4 � 8.5 nmol.120 min.l�1;
P < 0.05). Expression of SREBP-1c and FAS in adipose tissue was significantly
down-regulated, whereas expression of PDK4 and hormone-sensitive lipase
(HSL) was significantly up-regulated in both groups (P < 0.05). Thus, when
energy expenditure and energy deficit are matched, vigorous or moderate-
intensity exercise combined with energy restriction provide broadly similar
(positive) changes in metabolic control and adipose tissue gene expression.
Introduction
We recently showed that vigorous-intensity exercise has
enormously beneficial effects on systemic and adipose tis-
sue measures of metabolic health when young men were
challenged with an energy surplus from combined over-
feeding
and
reduced
physical
activity
(Walhin
et al.
2013). Notably, the effects from vigorous-intensity exer-
cise were evident within subcutaneous adipose tissue even
when this depot was actively expanding, and despite addi-
tional energy intake to account for the energy expended
through exercise (i.e., a standardized surplus). In the
opposite scenario of weight loss or maintenance, some
studies suggest that vigorous high-intensity exercise is
superior to energy-matched moderate-intensity exercise
for improving glucose control and insulin action (Kang
et al. 1996; Swain and Franklin 2006; Trapp et al. 2008).
Thus, we hypothesized that, during energy restriction,
vigorous-intensity exercise would provoke more beneficial
systemic and adipose-related changes than moderate-
intensity exercise.
Many
intervention
studies
have
investigated
the
effects of either dietary restriction (e.g., Fontana et al.
2007; Hammer et al. 2008; Larson-Meyer et al. 2006;
Wolever et al. 2008) or exercise alone (e.g., Balducci
et al.
2010;
Imayama
et al.
2012;
Jorge
et al.
2011;
Thompson et al. 2010) on metabolic and inflammatory
outcomes. Improvements in systemic markers of low-
grade inflammation often seem to increase with greater
weight/fat
loss
(Selvin
et al.
2007).

 scientific support for combining regular physical exer-
cise with an energy restricted diet as the most effective
treatment for obesity (Hsueh and Buchanan 1994; Bro-
chu et al. 2000; Poirier and Despres 2001) and in the
management of type 2 diabetes (Nathan et al. 2009).
Surprisingly, few studies have examined the impact of
exercise intensity combined with energy restriction on
changes within the primary tissue that responds to an
energy deficit (i.e., adipose tissue). However, in support
of our hypothesis that vigorous-intensity exercise would
confer additional benefits, there is one report that vig-
orous-intensity exercise combined with energy restric-
tion
increases
hormone-sensitive
lipase
(HSL)
gene
expression,
whereas
moderate-intensity
exercise
com-
bined with energy restriction does not have this effect
(You et al. 2012).
The purpose of this study was therefore to investigate
whether vigorous-intensity exercise combined with energy
restriction would further improve measures of metabolic
health and the expression of key genes within adipose
tissue compared to energy-matched moderate-intensity
exercise.
Methods
Participants
Thirty-eight sedentary men (n = 24) and postmenopausal
women (n = 14) with overweight (BMI >25 kg.m�2) com-
pleted this study. Participants were 45–64-years old with a
mean age of 52 � 5 years (mean � SD), and a maximal
oxygen uptake (V
̇ O2max) of 31.5 � 4.5 mL.kg�1.min�1,
body mass index (BMI) of 30.5 � 2.5 kg.m�2 and physical
activity level (PAL; total energy expenditure/resting energy
expenditure) of 1.58 � 0.17. Volunteers were recruited
from the local community. Participants had been weight
stable (�3 kg) for at least 6 months. Women were required
to be postmenopausal in order to take part in the study (no
menstruation for at least a year, Witteman et al. 1989). To
be eligible, participants were required to report no partici-
pation in regular structured exercise and that they did not
do >30 min of moderate-intensity exercise, accumulated in
10 min bouts, on most days of the week. Participants com-
pleted a health questionnaire and Physical Activity Readi-
ness Questionnaire (PAR-Q) to further verify eligibility and
provided written and verbal consent prior to taking part.
The protocol was approved by the Bath NHS Research
Ethics Committee (REC reference number: 08/H0101/194)
in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Individuals
who smoked, suffered from a condition known to interact
with the study measures or took regular medication that
may have interfered with the results were excluded from
the study.
Experimental design and protocol
A randomized parallel group design was used for this trial
(registration number: ISRCTN86152135). Participants were
randomly allocated by a third party to experience a fixed
energy deficit of 29302 kJ∙week�1 (7000 kcal∙week�1),
induced by energy restriction and increased physical activ-
ity via either moderate (MOD, n = 20) or vigorous (VIG,
n = 18) intensity physical exercise for 3 weeks. Volunteers
in both groups were asked to reduce their energy intake by
under-consuming their habitual diet in order to create an
energy deficit of 20930 kJ.week�1 (5000 kcal∙week�1). In
addition, participants in the MOD group increased their
physical activity by walking on a treadmill five times per
week at 50% of their maximum oxygen uptake while par-
ticipants in the VIG group increased their physical activity
by walking on a treadmill five times per week at 70% of
their maximum oxygen uptake. Importantly, both groups
expended 8372 kJ.week�1 (1674 kJ/400 kcal per session for
both groups) above rest through increased physical activity.
Participants also abstained from tea/coffee and alcohol the
day immediately before each trial.
On Day 1, participants arrived at the laboratory at
0700 � 0.5 h following an overnight fast (≥10 h). Body
mass was measured to the nearest 0.1 kg using electronic
scales (Tanita Corporation, Japan). Anthropometric mea-
surements were made in triplicate using a metallic tape
measure (Lufkin, US) before lean and fat mass were
determined
using
Dual-Energy
X-ray
absorptiometry
(DEXA; Discovery, Hologic, Bedford, UK). A baseline
blood sample was collected and a subcutaneous abdomi-
nal adipose tissue sample was then obtained before an
Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) was performed.
Blood pressure was measured in triplicate at the end of
each trial. This entire protocol was then repeated at fol-
low-up (Day 21).
Preliminary measurements
Participants recorded their food and fluid intake for a
typical 7-day period prior to taking part in the study
using a set of digital weighing scales (Model 3001, Salter,
Kent, UK). Dietary records were analyzed using the soft-
ware CompEat Pro Version 5.8.0 (Nutrition Systems,
UK), which is based on food composition tables for UK
foods. Energy intake was estimated using this software
and Diet Induced Thermogenesis (DIT) was estimated
preintervention as 10% of energy intake (Westerterp
2004). Combined heart-rate/accelerometry (Actiheart™)
was used to determine habitual physical activity thermo-
genesis at baseline.
Participants underwent a maximal oxygen uptake test
on a treadmill prior to the intervention (Woodway, ELG

Taylor et al. (1955). The percentage of O2 and CO2 in
expired air samples was determined using paramagnetic
and infrared gas analyzers, respectively (Series 1400, Ser-
vomex Ltd., Sussex, UK).
During the days leading up to the first trial, volunteers
followed their normal lifestyle and consumed their habit-
ual diet.
Intervention description and assumptions
The reported 7-day food and fluid intake from each par-
ticipant was used to calculate the energy intake required
to cause an energy deficit of 20930 kJ.week�1 (5000
kcal.week�1) from energy restriction alone. This was
achieved
by
subtracting
20930 kJ.week�1
(5000 kcal.
week�1) from their recorded total weekly energy expendi-
ture (assessed by the Actiheart™ during the diet recall
week, Thompson et al. 2006). The dietary energy restric-
tion was based on participants’ energy expenditure as
individuals with overweight and obesity have been shown
to under-report food intake (Macdiarmid and Blundell
1998). Based on this, participants’ recorded diets were
scaled down in order to induce the desired energy deficit
during the intervention. This was achieved by multiplying
the weight of all individual foods from the 7-day record
by a factor derived from the energy expenditure data in
order to achieve the desired energy intake during the
intervention. Participants repeated this 1 week diet three
times during the intervention.
Volunteers in both groups were required to perform
five exercise sessions a week at the correct speed and gra-
dient required for them to achieve either 50% V
̇ O2 max
for the MOD group or 70% V
̇ O2 max for the VIG group.
A corresponding heart rate (HR) at this gradient and
speed was estimated from the relationship between HR
and % V
̇ O2 max. Energy expenditure at the desired inten-
sity was utilized to calculate a set distance (km) required
to expend 1674 kJ (400 kcal) above resting energy expen-
diture. In order to account for post-exercise oxygen con-
sumption, measured oxygen consumption was adjusted
by an extra 5.4% for the MOD group and by 6.4% for
the VIG group to derive energy expenditure for each
exercise bout (Gore and Withers 1990). Participants were
asked to complete this distance at predicted HR below
50% V
̇ O2max for the MOD group or at least 70% V
̇ O2max
for
the
VIG
group.
Assuming
a
linear
relationship
between speed and energy expenditure when walking at a
set gradient (Franklin 2000), participants were then able
to adjust the speed in order to achieve the target heart
rate
and
intensity.
All
participants
confirmed
they
adhered to the exercise training by filling out an exercise
log and attending a weekly supervised exercise session.
They also confirmed to have only consumed the pre-
scribed foods over the course of the intervention. All par-
ticipants performed the final exercise bout prescribed
48 h before follow-up measurements were collected.
Blood sampling & analysis
Following the application of a topical local anesthetic
(1.5 mL Ametop gel, Smith & Nephew, Hull, England) an
18-gauge 1.3 9 45 mm cannula (BD Venflon Pro) was
inserted into an antecubital vein and a baseline blood sam-
ple collected. For the OGTT, participants ingested 113 mL
(75 g) of glucose (maltodextrin) solution (Polycal, Nutricia,
UK) within 5 min. Once ingested, blood samples were col-
lected every 15 min for 2 h. Blood samples were processed
and analyzed as previously described (Walhin et al. 2013).
Adipose tissue biopsy and processing
Adipose tissue biopsies were performed under local anes-
thesia (1% lidocaine) after insertion of the cannula and
before the OGTT. Subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue
was biopsied 4–7 cm lateral of the umbilicus with a 14-
gauge needle using the needle aspiration technique, with
follow-up biopsies sampled from the opposite side. The
sample was cleaned with isotonic saline and any clot was
manually removed. After weighing the sample, it was
homogenized in 5 mL of Trizol (Invitrogen, UK) and
placed on dry ice before being stored at �80°C. Subse-
quently, samples were defrosted and spun at 2500g for
5 min at 4°C. The top layer and pellet were removed and
200 lL of chloroform was added per 1 mL of Trizol.
After shaking the mixture vigorously for 15 sec samples
were incubated at room temperature for 3 min and then
centrifuged at 2500g for 5 min at 4°C. The aqueous phase
was removed and used for gene expression. Participants
were given the option to opt out of this procedure, adi-
pose tissue biopsies were collected from a subset of par-
ticipants, as a result there are n = 12 in both groups.
Quantitative real-time PCR
The aqueous phase was mixed with an equal volume of
70% Ethanol before being loaded on an RNeasy mini col-
umn for extraction (Qiagen, Crawley, UK) as previously
described (Walhin et al. 2013). Assays from Applied
Biosystems were used: ADIPONECTIN (Hs00605917_m1),
LEPTIN (Hs00174877_m1), SREBP-1c (Hs01088691_m1),
PDK4(Hs00176875_m1), FAS (Hs00188012_m1), PPARc

Real-time PCR was performed using a StepOne™ (Applied
Biosystems, Warrington, UK). PPIA (Peptidylpropyl iso-
merase A) was used as an endogenous control. The com-
parative Ct method was used to process the data where
DCt = Ct Target gene – Ct Endogenous control. Data were
normalized to an internal calibrator and baseline.
Statistical analysis
To simplify data analysis and facilitate a more meaning-
ful
interpretation
of
an
otherwise
complex
factorial
research design (Matthews et al. 1990; Hopkins et al.
2009), serial measurements of glucose and insulin at
baseline and follow-up were converted into simple sum-
mary statistics to illustrate the net response of each
parameter (i.e., within-subject peak concentrations, time
to peak and incremental area under curve, Wolever and
Jenkins 1986). Preplanned contrasts (#) were conducted
in relation to the absolute group differences both at
final follow-up and the relative change from baseline
(Atkinson 2002). The precise time course of responses
within and between trials were analyzed using factorial
2-
and
three-way
mixed-model
analysis
of
variance
(group 9 day & group 9 day 9 time, respectively)
irrespective of minor deviations from a normal distribu-
tion
(Maxwell
and
Delaney
1990)
but
with
the
Greenhouse-Geisser correction applied to intraindividual
contrasts for ɛ<0.75 and the Huynh-Feldt correction
adopted
for
less
severe
asphericity
(Atkinson
2002).
Where significant interactions were observed, multiple t-
tests were applied to determine the location of variance
both
between
treatments
at
level
time
points
and
between time points within each treatment relative to
baseline, with both methods subject to a Holm–Bonfer-
roni correction (Atkinson 2002). For all the above sta-
tistical approaches, statistical significance was set at an
alpha level of P ≤ 0.05. Data are presented in text as
means and standard deviations (SDs), whereas the vari-
ance bars on figures are confidence intervals (CIs) that
have been corrected to remove interindividual variation
(Masson and Loftus 2003). For reference, the magnitude
of these CIs illustrate the change at each time point rel-
ative to baseline such that, in general, plotted means
whose CIs do not overlap by more than one-half of one
side of an interval are likely to be deemed statistically
different according to conventional significance testing
(Masson and Loftus 2003).
A main effect of day denotes an effect of energy deficit
per se (†: Day 1 vs. Day 21 both groups), whereas a
day 9 group interaction means there is a mediating effect
of exercise intensity (*). Statistical analysis for the gene
expression data was carried out on the log-transformed
data following normalization to a housekeeper, an inter-
nal calibrator and baseline (Livak and Schmittgen 2001).
Any change score (normalized follow-up data vs. normal-
ized baseline data) that was over 3 SD from the mean
were excluded from the presentation shown in Figure 2
but were included in the statistical analysis. Samples out-
side the detectable limit (Ct>35) were excluded from the
analysis. The Pearson rank correlation was employed to
determine the strength of relationships between parame-
ters. For CRP and IL-6, the mean and standard deviation
of the change (Δ) were calculated using all data points.
Any change score that was over 3 SD away from the
mean were excluded from analysis as this would likely
have been due to an acute inflammatory response. This is
mentioned in the Figure legend when this rule has been
applied.
Results
Anthropometric and physiological measures
Anthropometric and physiological measures pre- and
postintervention are summarized in Table 1. Body mass,
waist and hip circumference, fat mass, abdominal fat, sys-
tolic and diastolic blood pressure significantly decreased
(P ≤ 0.05) in both groups. There was no day 9 group
interaction.
Insulin & glucose responses to OGTT
The insulinemic response following the OGTT was signifi-
cantly reduced (P = 0.005) at follow-up for both groups
with a decrease in 2 h insulin iAUC as shown by Fig-
ure 1. The plasma glucose concentrations in response to
the OGTT at follow-up were unaffected in both groups
(see supplemental data Figure S2). The glycemic response
following the OGTT decreased in the MOD group while
the 2 h venous glucose iAUC modestly increased in the
VIG group postintervention (day 9 group interaction
P = 0.04; Figure 1).
The Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resis-
tance (HOMA-IR) and the Homeostasis Model Assess-
ment of b-cell function (HOMA-b) decreased (P = 0.001)
at follow-up in both groups. The Matsuda Index or Com-
posite Index (ISI comp) increased (P = 0.007) at follow-
up in both groups. Data is summarized in Table 2.
Fasted blood measurements
Serum adiponectin, leptin, cholesterol, HDL cholesterol,
LDL cholesterol, TAG, ALT, CRP and whole blood WBC
concentrations significantly decreased (P ≤ 0.05) at fol-
low-up in both groups. Data are summarized in Table 2.

The Impact of Exercise Intensity on Adipose Tissue
J.-P. Walhin et al.
 Discussion
This study assessed the impact of energy restriction com-
bined with energy-matched moderate or vigorous-inten-
sity
exercise
in
sedentary
men
and
postmenopausal
women with overweight/obesity. We demonstrated that
3 weeks of energy restriction and increased physical activ-
ity improved fasting measures of metabolic control and
inflammation, responses to an OGTT, and expression of
several key genes within adipose tissue. These positive
changes were mostly unaffected by exercise intensity.
In order to investigate whether vigorous-intensity exer-
cise offers added benefits compared to moderate-intensity
exercise in improving metabolic control and inflammatory
markers in sedentary individuals with overweight/obesity,
we used a model where energy restriction and physical
exercise
energy
expenditure
were
carefully
matched
between groups. This combined approach has been success-
fully used in several other studies for similar purposes (You
et al. 2004; Nicklas et al. 2009). We successfully induced a
standardized negative energy balance, resulting in a weight
loss of 2.4 � 1.4 kg and 2.4 � 1.1 kg in MOD and VIG
groups, respectively. Our data suggest that after 3 weeks of
energy restriction and increased physical exercise, improve-
ments in insulin sensitivity and metabolic control were evi-
dent as illustrated by a similar reduction in waist/hip
circumferences, fat mass, blood pressure, total cholesterol
and LDL cholesterol, TAG, ALT, CRP, whole blood WBC,
and by the improvement in the expression of four key genes
expressed within adipose tissue. Notably, the majority of
these changes were unaffected by exercise intensity.
Although the benefits of energy restriction combined
with increased physical activity on human health are well
documented, little is known about the impact on the
transcriptome of adipose tissue during energy deficit in
humans. The adipose organ is a major site for energy
storage and one of the main tissues being impacted dur-
ing a period of negative energy balance (Capel et al. 2009;
Bouchard et al. 2010). SREBP-1c was down-regulated to a
similar degree in both groups in this study. SREBP-1c is a
transcription factor that regulates the expression of the
lipogenic enzyme FAS (Minehira et al. 2003) and our
data support this as there was a strong positive correla-
tion between changes in the expression of SREBP-1c and
changes in the expression of FAS (r = 0.77; P < 0.001)
which was also similarly down-regulated in both groups.
Changes at the mRNA level have been shown to translate
to similar changes in the active form of the protein for
SREBP-1c (Repa et al. 2000) and FAS (Claycombe et al.
1998). SREBP-1c mediates the effects of insulin and glu-
cose on the regulation of key genes associated with glu-
cose
metabolism;
there
was
an
inverse
correlation
between changes in insulin iAUC and changes in the
expression of SREBP-1c (r = �0.47; P = 0.03). Tsintzas
et al. (2006) showed that SREBP-1c mRNA was down-
regulated 2.5 fold in skeletal muscle following 48 h of
starvation in healthy males. Conversely, overfeeding has
been shown to increase the expression of SREBP-1c
mRNA in the adipose tissue of participants with a range
of BMI (Minehira et al. 2004; Walhin et al. 2013). Gene
expression of PDK4 in adipose tissue increased in both
groups, potentially highlighting a switch of oxidative fuel
from glucose to fatty acids by the adipose tissue. Expres-
sion of this gene is regulated by glucocorticoids, retinoic
acid, and insulin (Kwon and Harris 2004). During starva-
tion, the activation of PDK4 results in a switch of oxida-
tive fuel use from glucose to fatty acids (Wu et al. 2000;
Jeoung et al. 2006; Tsintzas et al. 2006). The model used
in this study decreased HOMA-IR, HOMA-b and the
insulinemic response to a standard glucose load, while
increasing ISI similarly in both groups, potentially favor-
ing a switch to fatty acid metabolism. Hormone-sensitive
lipase (HSL) is an enzyme that regulates adipose tissue
lipid metabolism as it catalyzes the hydrolysis of triglyc-
erides and diglycerides (Holm et al. 2000) and plays an
important role in chronic exercise-induced changes in
adipose tissue metabolism. Gene expression of HSL in
adipose tissue significantly increased in both groups.
Changes in HSL mRNA and protein levels have been
shown to be correlated (Jocken et al. 2007) and HSL is a
major determinant of the maximum lipolytic capacity of
human adipocytes (Large et al. 1998). Collectively, our
results indicate that combined energy restriction and
increased physical activity leads to an increase in the oxi-
dation of fatty acids by adipose tissue independent of
exercise intensity (as indicated by changes in the follow-
ing transcripts: ↓ SRPBP-1c, ↓ FAS, ↑ PDK4, ↑ HSL).
Short-term negative energy balance positively impacts
metabolic control whether that is induced through energy
restriction alone (Weiss et al. 2006; Fontana et al. 2007;
Lagerpusch et al. 2011) or exercise alone (Oshida et al.
1989; Kang et al. 1996; Tjonna et al. 2008). A review of
epidemiological data by Swain & Franklin (Swain and
Franklin 2006) examined the benefits of moderate versus
vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise in improving cardio-
vascular health and reducing the risk of coronary heart
disease. They concluded that if the total energy expendi-
ture of exercise is held constant, exercise performed at a
vigorous-intensity appears to further reduce the risk of
cardiovascular disease compared to moderate-intensity
exercise. Conversely, a study by Nicklas et al. (2009)
found that the combination of energy restriction and
increased physical activity (independent of intensity) pro-
duced similar weight loss and changes in lipids, glucose,
and insulin metabolism across treatment groups. The pre-
sent study also suggests that, during energy restriction,

The Impact of Exercise Intensity on Adipose Tissue
 the intensity of exercise is less important when exercise
energy expenditure is carefully matched.
The results of this study indicate that while vigorous-
intensity exercise has a dramatic positive impact on
maintaining metabolic control during a short period of
positive energy balance (Walhin et al. 2013), it does not
appear to provide profound additional health-related ben-
efits compared to moderate-intensity exercise during a
negative energy balance. Interestingly, the genes that were
up-regulated (SREBP-1c & FAS) and down-regulated
(PDK4, HSL) by a period of positive energy balance
(Walhin et al. 2013) were down-regulated (SREBP1c &
FAS) and up-regulated (PDK4, HSL) by a period of nega-
tive energy balance in this study. Collectively, these results
highlight the adaptability of human adipose tissue during
manipulations of energy balance. Although we cannot
determine this conclusively based on the current design
and available information, we tentatively propose that
vigorous-intensity exercise has a more powerful effect on
these genes in the context of an energy surplus and a less
powerful effect during an energy deficit. This may be
related to the sophisticated and carefully orchestrated
mechanisms that have evolved to mount a powerful
defense against fat loss (Badman and Flier 2007; Friedman
2009; Oswal and Yeo 2010) and that these systems over-
whelm the more subtle impact from differences in exer-
cise intensity during energy restriction.
To conclude, this experiment shows that short-term
energy restriction combined with either vigorous or mod-
erate-intensity physical exercise improves insulin sensitiv-
ity, lipid profiles, and markers of inflammation. The
expression of several key genes in adipose tissue of seden-
tary men and postmenopausal women with overweight/
obesity was also positively and similarly altered with
either
vigorous
or
moderate-intensity
exercise
when
energy expenditure and energy deficit were matched.
Thus, the benefits of increased physical exercise combined
with energy restriction are mostly independent of exercise
intensity.
