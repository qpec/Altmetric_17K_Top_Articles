Introduction England introduced a tobacco display 
ban for shops with >280 m2 floor area (’partial ban’) 
in 2012, then a total ban in 2015. This study assessed 
whether these were linked to child awareness of and 
access to cigarettes.
Methods Data come from the Smoking, Drinking and 
Drug Use survey, an annual survey of children aged 
11–15 years for 2010–2014 and 2016. Multivariate 
logistic regression models assessed changes in having 
seen cigarettes on display, usual sources and ease of 
access to cigarettes in shops
Results During the partial display ban in 2012, 89.9% 
of children reported seeing cigarettes on display in 
the last year, which was reduced to 86.0% in 2016 
after the total ban (adjusted OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.50 to 
0.66). Reductions were similar in small shops (84.1% 
to 79.3%)%) and supermarkets (62.6% to 57.3%)%). 
Although the ban was associated with a reduction in the 
proportion of regular child smokers reporting that they 
bought cigarettes in shops (57.0% in 2010 to 39.8% in 
2016), we did not find evidence of changes in perceived 
difficulty or being refused sale among those who still did.
Discussion Tobacco point-of-sale display bans in 
England reduced the exposure of children to cigarettes in 
shops and coincided with a decrease in buying cigarettes 
in shops. However, children do not report increased 
difficulty in obtaining cigarettes from shops, highlighting 
the need for additional measures to tackle tobacco 
advertising, stronger enforcement of existing laws and 
measures such as licencing for tobacco retailers.
bACkgRounD
Most people who smoke start smoking during child-
hood.1 This means that measures to reduce child 
uptake of smoking are essential to bring the tobacco 
epidemic to an end, delivering the objective of a 
‘smoke free generation’. One such strategy is the 
introduction of point-of-sale display bans to reduce 
the visibility and appeal of tobacco products. There 
is evidence that exposure to retail tobacco displays 
increases desire to smoke and to make unplanned 
purchases while reducing the likelihood of making 
a successful quit attempt.2–5 Children are partic-
ularly susceptible to tobacco marketing that can 
influence their behaviour as well as altering their 
perception of the acceptability of smoking and esti-
mates of peer smoking rates.6–8 
The WHO MPOWER strategy includes ‘Enforce 
bans on tobacco advertising, promotion and spon-
sorship’ as one of its six pillars, and Article 13 of 
the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco 
Control, which came into force in 2005, advocates 
a complete ban on any display of tobacco prod-
ucts at points of sale.9 Tobacco display bans are 
popular,10 but policies in this area face pushback 
from the tobacco industry and its proxies,11 so data 
evaluating their impact should form a useful guide 
for legislators considering implementing this policy. 
Ecological data from countries that have imple-
mented such bans have found them to be linked to 
declines in adult smoking prevalence, as has individ-
ual-level data on the impacts of banning the display 
of cigarettes from large shops in England.12 13 Avail-
able analyses so far, however, have not considered 
the impacts of the policy on children.
A ban on the display of tobacco products was 
introduced in England for large shops (>280 
m2 
floor area) from 6 April 2012 and this was extended 
to all shops on s6 April 2015.14 15 We used data from 
the annual English Smoking, Drinking and Drug 
Use (SDDU) survey of children to assess whether 
there had been a change in children’s exposure to 
cigarette packets, where children who smoked are 
obtaining cigarettes and ease of accessing cigarettes 
in shops.
MeThoDs
Data for this study come from the SDDU survey 
for England, which is used by the government to 
monitor performance of the Tobacco Control Plan 
in terms of youth smoking.16 17 The survey includes 
schoolchildren in years 7–11 (mostly aged 11–15 
years) with data collected by a self-completion paper 
questionnaire during school time in ‘exam condi-
tions’ with pupils unable to discuss questions or 
look at each other’s answers. The survey is designed 
to be representative of the sex, school year and 
region of children in England with schools selected 
to provide a mixture of school types (comprehen-
sive, secondary modern, grammar, private, single 
sex and mixed), by each region of England. Survey 
sampling was between September and January for 
each year, and thus the 2012 data are from at least 
5 
months after the introduction of the partial ban, 
and the 2016 data are from at least 15 months after 
the introduction of the total ban. The timings of 
data collections in relation to the policy changes are 
displayed in figure 1.
SDDU is cross-sectional with no repeated 
measures on the same children, with sample sizes 
for each year ranging from 6173 (2014) to 12 051 
(2016). We used complete case analysis, and as the 
different outcomes were asked in different years, 
there were differing sample sizes for each anal-
yses. Numbers of respondents in each analysis are 
detailed in the appropriate tables.

Variables
This study investigated a number of outcomes that were assessed 
as follows. Exposure to cigarette packaging was assessed in 
2012, 2014 and 2016 using the question, ‘In the past year, 
have you seen cigarette packets on display in any of the shops 
listed below? Only include shops where you have seen cigarette 
packets displayed on a shelf or counter. Do not include signs or 
adverts saying cigarettes can be bought.’. Children could tick 
all responses that applied, and answers were: a supermarket; 
a newsagent, tobacconist or a sweet shop; a petrol station or 
garage shop; and some other type of shop.
Sources of cigarettes were assessed in 2010, 2012, 2014 and 
2016 using the question, ‘Where do you usually get your ciga-
rettes from?’. Children could tick more than one box from a 
possible 14 responses. We grouped these into buying from 
shops (supermarkets, newsagents, garages or ‘some other type 
of shop’), buying from other sources (buying from friends, 
machines, the internet or street markets) and being given ciga-
rettes (by friends, parents, siblings or ‘someone else’). We also 
additionally investigate buying from small shops, buying from 
large shops (supermarkets) and buying from friends individually.
We used two measures of ease of access to cigarettes in shops 
collected in 2010, 2012, 2014 and 2016. First, being refused 
sale of cigarettes in a shop was assessed using the question, ‘The 
last time you went into a shop to buy cigarettes, what happened?’ 
with possible responses, ‘I bought cigarettes’ and ‘the shopkeeper 
refused to sell me cigarettes’. Second, reported difficulty in 
obtaining cigarettes in shops was assessed using the question, 
‘On the whole, do you find it easy or difficult to buy cigarettes 
from a shop?’, which was categorised into ‘fairly or very easy’ 
versus ‘very or fairly difficult’.
The SDDU collects other data from children that we have 
included as potential confounders of the main relationships of 
interest. These were age, sex, ever use of alcohol (yes/no) and 
ever use of drugs (yes/no). We also use data on the smoking 
status of children. In line with the official SDDU reports, we 
categorise this into non-smokers, occasional smokers (children 
reported smoking fewer than one cigarette a week) and regular 
smokers (smoking at least one cigarette a week).16
Analyses
All outcomes were first explored descriptively. Logistic regres-
sion models assessed whether levels of exposure to cigarette 
packaging in 2014 and 2016 were different to those in 2012 after 
controlling for age, sex, ever use of drugs, ever use of alcohol 
and smoking status. These models were performed separately 
for small shops and large shops, then exposure in any shop. We 
also present subgroup analyses of changes in exposure in any 
shop stratified by each of our age, sex, alcohol use, drug use 
and smoking status subgroups. In order to investigate potential 
differences in changes across groups, interaction tests were used 
to assess the statistical significance of changes between 2016 and 
2012 across each subgroup of age, sex, ever use of alcohol and 
drugs and smoking status studied.
In order to assess changes in usual source of cigarettes among 
regular smokers, we first ran logistic regression models assessing 
differences in buying in shops, buying from other sources and 
being given cigarettes. Then, to assess potential differences due to 
the legislation targeting first large and then small shops, we used 
three separate models for each of small shops, large shops (super-
markets) and in buying cigarettes from friends. These models used 
2010 (before any display bans) as a reference and controlled for 
age, sex, ever use of alcohol and ever use of drugs. The primary 
analyses for all of these outcomes are based only on children cate-
gorised as regular smokers. We additionally present these same 
analyses in the appendix based on both regular and occasional 
smokers. We used the same modelling strategy to examine our 
two measures of ease of access to cigarettes in shops. All regression 
analyses employed survey weights derived by the SDDU team to 
correct for unequal probabilities of selection between sex, school 
year and regions.
ResulTs
A percentage of 89.9 of children reported being exposed 
to cigarette packaging in shops in 2012, which increased to 
92.6% in 2014 (adjusted OR (AOR) 1.26, 95% CI 1.10 to 
1.44 and decreased to 86.0% in 2016 (AOR 0.58, 95% CI 
0.50 to 0.66) (table 1). A similar trend was observed for small 
shops: 84.1% of children were exposed in 2012, 86.1% in 
2014 (AOR 1.11, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.24) and 79.3% in 2016 
(AOR 0.65, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.73). For large shops there were 
declines in exposure from 62.6% in 2012 to 61.1% in 2014 
(AOR 0.89, 95% CI 0.83 to 0.96) and 57.3% in 2016 (AOR 
0.70, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.77).
All of the groups we studied experienced statistically significant 
declines in exposure to cigarette packaging in shops over the study 
period (figure 2). Interaction testing of changes between 2012 and 
2016 for different groups find that there were larger reductions 
among individuals aged 15 
years than individuals aged 11 
years, 
from −2.1% for individuals aged 11 
years to −5.5% for individ-
uals aged 15 
years (p value for difference=0.033; supplementary 
appendix table A1). There were also larger reductions among 
Figure 1 Data collection points and tobacco display ban policy changes.

regular smokers (−15.6%) than among non-smokers (−3.5%, p 
value for difference=0.001).
Buying from a shop was a usual source of cigarettes for 57.0% 
of the sample regular child smokers in 2010, and this was not 
significantly different in 2012 or 2014. In 2016, this declined 
to 39.8% (AOR 0.42, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.70) (table 2). Buying 
from sources other than a shop was a usual source for 39.3% of 
regular child smokers in 2010, which declined to 28.0% in 2014 
(AOR 0.62, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.93) and 26.1% in 2016 (AOR 
0.41, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.70). Being given cigarettes was a usual 
source for 62.4% of regular child smokers in 2010, and this did 
not change over the study period, for example, 60.9% in 2016 
(AOR 0.81, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.38).
A percentage of 51.1 of regular child smokers noted small shops 
as a usual source of cigarettes in 2010, which was unchanged in 
2012 and 2014 but declined to 34.2% in 2016 (AOR 0.31, 95% 
CI 0.18 to 0.51). A percentage of 14.9 of regular child smokers 
used supermarkets as a usual source for cigarettes in 2010, and 
this was not found to change statistically significantly during 
the study period. A percentage of 34.3 of children reported that 
buying cigarettes from friends was a usual source of cigarettes 
in 2010, which declined to 25.5% in 2016 (AOR 0.50, 95% CI 
0.29 0.83)
Unweighted percentages show that the most common source of 
cigarettes in 2010 was being given by friends, followed by buying 
from a newsagent and that there was relatively little change in 
these rankings between 2010 and 2016 (online supplementary 
appendix table A2). Logistic regression analyses of changes in 
sources of cigarettes over time among both regular and occa-
sional smokers give similar results to our main analyses among 
regular smokers only (online supplementary appendix table A3)
A percentage of 31.2 of regular child smokers reported being 
refused the sale of cigarettes at their last attempt, and this was 
not found to be statistically significantly different in any of 
the later years (table 3). For example, 32.5% of regular child 
smokers reported being refused in 2016 (AOR 1.23, 95% CI 
0.58 to 2.66). A percentage of 61.0 of children reported that it 
was easy or very easy to buy cigarettes in shops in 2010, which 
also was not found to be statistically significantly different in any 
of the later years. For example, 64.7% of regular child smokers 
reported that cigarettes were easy or very easy to buy in 2016 
(AOR 0.60, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.13).
Sensitivity analyses of both of these outcomes among both 
regular and occasional smokers do not suggest any changes in 
ease of accessing cigarettes in shops for children attempting to 
buy them in shops (online supplementary appendix table A4).

tobacco packaging in shops; (2) there was a substantial reduction 
in children who smoked obtaining cigarettes from shops; and (3) 
we did not find evidence of changes in the perceived difficulty 
of obtaining cigarettes among children who did buy them from 
shops.
The present data suggest that there was a modest fall in the 
proportion of children reporting exposure to cigarette pack-
aging in shops following the partial and complete bans on 
tobacco displays. Since tobacco displays stimulate the desire to 
smoke, a reduction in their visibility to children is welcome and 
suggests that the ban is working as intended. The reduction in 
exposure was found to be consistent between sexes but with 
potentially larger associations among individuals aged 15 
years 
than individuals aged 11 
years. The reduction in reports of 
having seen cigarettes in shops was greatest in those who were 
regular smokers (93.2% in 2012 to 77.6% in 2016 following the 
total ban), who may be more accurate in their recall of tobacco 
packaging display. The findings are consistent with Australian 
data on the effectiveness of tobacco control policies that suggests 
a significant link between the extent of implementation of point 
of sale and outdoor advertising and adolescent smoking rates.18 
Our findings do suggest, however, that the majority of chil-
dren still report seeing cigarettes in the previous year, which is 
consistent with international evidence on tobacco display bans, 
where large numbers of people still report seeing cigarettes on 
display despite official reports of compliance being high.19 20 
In England, a 2016/2017 report by Trading Standards, which 
enforces tobacco promotion and sale legislation on behalf of the 
Department of Health, found that there was 92% compliance 
with tobacco display bans in England.21 Even perfect compli-
ance with the display ban will still provide some opportunities 
for children to see cigarettes packaging if they are waiting to be 
served when the display cabinet is opened for another customer. 
However, the exact mechanism then by which so many children 
report seeing cigarettes on display deserves further investigation 
and may suggest that more rigorous assessments of compliance 
would be beneficial, especially in order to assess whether any 
impacts of the display ban changes over time. Nonetheless, 
display bans can also be effective in reducing smoking behaviour 
as part of general efforts to denormalise tobacco use, as well 
as communicating negative perceptions of society as a whole to 
tobacco use.19
The survey period also show changes over time in where 
children who are regular smokers obtain cigarettes. The most 
common method of obtaining cigarettes remains being given 
them by friends and fewer children now report that they buy ciga-
rettes themselves. These data also reinforce the important role of 
small shops such as newsagents and garages in allowing children 
to obtain cigarettes, which is now becoming less common. For 
example, there were substantial falls in the proportion of regular 
smokers reporting that they bought them from newsagents 
(46.1% 2010 to 30.4% 2016) or garages (15.4% to 6.8%)%). 
In all forms of shops, the additional need for tobacco displays 
to be opened may act as a psychological deterrent for some chil-
dren or may serve as a reminder to people working in shops that 
they are selling a product that has age restrictions. However, 
during the time period studied here, there have been substantial 
falls in funding for enforcement of age of sale and other tobacco 
sale restrictions; – there has been a 56% reduction in full-time 
equivalent Trading Standards staff in England between 2009 
and 2016.22 Local directors of public health have also expressed 
concerns about levels of funding available for the enforcement

of such legislation among other policies such as smoking cessa-
tion.23 International evidence is clear that even modest invest-
ments in enforcement of existing laws has an impact on sales to 
minors, and additionally that enforcement can assist with the 
effectiveness of other policies to reduce smoking among youth 
and in adults.24–27 Together these findings suggest that the legis-
lation is having some success despite these falls in enforcement 
spending and that greater reductions could be achieved if this 
spending was increased. They also suggest that a tobacco retailer 
scheme may be required if access to cigarettes among children 
is to be fully controlled.28 Finally, while data limitations means 
we were unable to examine the issue here, existing evidence 
also suggests that enforcement of age of sale laws has impacts 
on smoking that are similar across markers of socioeconomic 
circumstances.29 30
Displays of cigarettes at the point of sale are only one method 
among many by which tobacco is advertised, which includes 
in social media and on cigarette packets. Point-of-sale display 
bans are thus an important intervention to reduce the exposure 
of populations to tobacco advertising, but a comprehensive 
approach is needed. For example, interventions to either remove 
protobacco messages or promote antismoking are both effective 
at reducing smoking levels.31 32 Both antismoking advertising 
intensity and duration are important for ensuring reductions in 
adolescent smoking prevalence and must receive an appropriate 
level of funding.33 34 More recently, some countries, including 
the UK, have moved to restrict the potential for tobacco to be 
advertised on cigarette packets by implementing standardised 
packaging for tobacco, which is reducing smoking levels.35–37 
The increasing influence of social media as a vehicle for adver-
tising cigarettes has also been noted, and this may need addi-
tional legislation.38
strengths and limitations
This study presents the first national analysis of the impacts of 
banning tobacco displays at the point of sale in England on chil-
dren’s exposure and access to tobacco products. It relies on data 
used by the government to monitor smoking prevalence among 
children and allowed consideration of data from a number of 
years. However, there are some limitations to consider. During 
the study period, there has been both a secular fall in smoking 
prevalence as well as other changes in legislation, such as the 
ban on cigarette vending machines, publicity around stan-
dardised packaging and bans on smoking in cars with children 
as well as steady increases in the price of cigarettes. Nonethe-
less, the SDDU does reflect the behaviours, experience and 
attitudes of children who continue to smoke in England. The 
period covered (2010– 2016) also includes the emergence of 
e-cigarettes into the UK market. The 2016 SDDU asked chil-
dren about e-cigarettes and found that regular use was 2% in 
2016, and in line with other data found that the majority of use 
was among current tobacco users.39 40 Similar to cigarettes, the 
most common sources of e-cigarettes were being given by friends 
(35% of regular users), although other common methods of 
obtaining them included buying from an e-cigarette shop (24% 
of regular users) and buying from the internet (23% of regular 
users). While positive for health, the declining rate of smoking 
among young people does mean that our analyses of sources of 
cigarettes and ease of access among regular smokers are based on 
small sample sizes. In line with the official reports from SDDU, 
we restrict our main analyses on sources of cigarettes to regular 
child smokers, the numbers of which have been declining over 
this time period, which could lead to an underestimate of the 
impact of the display ban. However, we have tried to limit these 
problems by including sensitivity analyses from the larger group 
of current smokers, which gave similar results to our main find-
ings. It is also possible that point-of-sale display bans have played 
a direct role in this fall in prevalence, with those who find it 
more difficult to obtain cigarettes either quitting smoking or not 
becoming smokers, but we have no data to address this directly.
The SDDU survey contains limited covariate data that restricts 
our ability to control for potentially important confounders that 
may influence exposure to tobacco or the sources children who 
smoke make use of. Particularly, for 2016, the survey did not 
ask children about their eligibility for free school meals, which 
is a good marker of deprivation and has been used in previous 
research.41 42 This omission means that we cannot assess whether 
the total display ban had an impact on inequalities in our 
outcomes nor whether deprivation may have affected our esti-
mates of effect size as factors such as smoking among friends and 
family are linked to socioeconomic status. Additionally, ques-
tions on the display of cigarettes were only added to the SDDU 
from 2012, which means we were unable to assess the levels of 
this exposure before the introduction of the partial point-of-sale 
display ban as well as whether any impacts have changed due to 
the introduction of the partial ban. Also, the questions covered 
seeing cigarettes on display in the previous 12 months, which 
may introduce some inaccuracy to reporting, although our data 
from 2016 are a full 15 months after the introduction of the 
total ban on cigarette display in shops. Other potential source 
of inaccuracy for the analyses of exposure to cigarette packaging 
include the long time period assessed by our exposure question 
(12 months) and children remembering signs such as ‘we sell 
cigarettes here’ or advertisements for e-cigarettes.
ConClusIon
The introduction of point-of-sale display bans for tobacco prod-
ucts has been associated with a reduction in children’s expo-
sure to tobacco products in shops. It has also coincided with 
a substantial reduction in the proportion of children buying 
tobacco in shops, though those who continue to do this do 
not appear to be finding it more difficult. Point-of-sale display 
bans have a role in reducing child access to tobacco, but addi-
tional measures, in particular enforcement of age restrictions on 
purchase and schemes to license retailers, are likely to be needed 
to further reduce child uptake of smoking.
What this paper adds
 
► This study of nationally representative data for England 
provides the first assessment of the impacts of the tobacco 
display ban on children as well as detailed data on the extent 
of child exposure to tobacco packaging in shops and their 
sources of buying cigarettes.
 
► We find that tobacco point-of-sale display bans may have 
a role in reducing child smoking, being associated with a 
reduction in exposure in shops and a reduction in buying 
from shops. Nonetheless, levels of exposure to cigarettes in 
shops remains high, and those who continue to buy from 
shops do not appear to be finding it more difficult.
