BACKGROUND
In a previous study, a single injection of inclisiran, a chemically synthesized small 
interfering RNA designed to target PCSK9 messenger RNA, was found to produce 
sustained reductions in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels over the 
course of 84 days in healthy volunteers.
METHODS
We conducted a phase 2, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-
ascending-dose trial of inclisiran administered as a subcutaneous injection in 
patients at high risk for cardiovascular disease who had elevated LDL cholesterol 
levels. Patients were randomly assigned to receive a single dose of placebo or 200, 
300, or 500 mg of inclisiran or two doses (at days 1 and 90) of placebo or 100, 200, 
or 300 mg of inclisiran. The primary end point was the change from baseline in 
LDL cholesterol level at 180 days. Safety data were available through day 210, and 
data on LDL cholesterol and proprotein convertase subtilisin–kexin type 9 (PCSK9) 
levels were available through day 240.
RESULTS
A total of 501 patients underwent randomization. Patients who received inclisiran 
had dose-dependent reductions in PCSK9 and LDL cholesterol levels. At day 180, 
the least-squares mean reductions in LDL cholesterol levels were 27.9 to 41.9% 
after a single dose of inclisiran and 35.5 to 52.6% after two doses (P<0.001 for all 
comparisons vs. placebo). The two-dose 300-mg inclisiran regimen produced the 
greatest reduction in LDL cholesterol levels: 48% of the patients who received the 
regimen had an LDL cholesterol level below 50 mg per deciliter (1.3 mmol per liter) 
at day 180. At day 240, PCSK9 and LDL cholesterol levels remained significantly 
lower than at baseline in association with all inclisiran regimens. Serious adverse 
events occurred in 11% of the patients who received inclisiran and in 8% of the 
patients who received placebo. Injection-site reactions occurred in 5% of the patients 
who received injections of inclisiran.
CONCLUSIONS
In our trial, inclisiran was found to lower PCSK9 and LDL cholesterol levels among 
patients at high cardiovascular risk who had elevated LDL cholesterol levels. (Funded 
by the Medicines Company; ORION-1 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02597127.)

Inclisiran in Patients with Elevated LDL Cholesterol
L
ow-density lipoprotein (LDL) choles-
terol is a causal factor in atherosclerotic car-
diovascular disease. Statins have been shown 
to reduce LDL cholesterol levels and cardiovascu-
lar events in large outcome trials, findings that 
have made them the therapeutic cornerstone of 
clinical practice.1 Despite the proven efficacy of 
statins, there is considerable variability in indi-
vidual responses to these drugs.2 Furthermore, 
some observational data suggest that as many as 
half of persons who begin statin therapy discon-
tinue it within a year.3 Moreover, among patients 
receiving statin therapy who are at high risk for 
cardiovascular disease and who have persistent 
elevation of LDL cholesterol levels, the rates of 
cardiovascular events remain high, necessitating 
the development of additional therapies.
The discovery that the serine protease propro-
tein convertase subtilisin–kexin type 9 (PCSK9) 
promotes the degradation of the LDL receptor 
affords an additional route through which LDL 
cholesterol levels in plasma can be controlled.4 
Initial therapeutic approaches to reducing circu-
lating levels of PCSK9 have focused on the use 
of monoclonal antibodies. This approach seques-
ters virtually all PCSK9 in the reticuloendothelial 
system, thus preventing it from binding to the 
LDL receptor.5,6 Circulating PCSK9 is derived 
almost entirely from the liver7; hence, therapeu-
tic approaches that target hepatic production 
of PCSK9 may offer an alternative to the use of 
monoclonal antibodies.
RNA interference and related RNA silencing 
pathways provide an opportunity to harness a 
highly specific endogenous mechanism for reg-
ulating gene expression.8 Small interfering RNAs 
(siRNAs) selectively and catalytically silence the 
translation of their complementary target mes-
senger RNAs (mRNAs) in a sequence-specific 
manner through the formation of effector RNA-
induced silencing complexes.9,10 Inclisiran is an 
investigational, chemically synthesized siRNA 
molecule that has produced sustained hepatocyte-
specific, PCSK9-specific RNA silencing in healthy 
volunteers to 84 days after administration.11 Here, 
we present the results of the phase 2 ORION-1 
trial, a dose-finding trial evaluating the efficacy 
of different inclisiran dosing regimens among 
patients who have elevated LDL cholesterol levels 
despite receiving the maximum possible dose of 
a statin and who are considered to be at high 
risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. 
Within the limits of the trial, we also evaluated 
the safety and efficacy of inclisiran in lowering 
LDL cholesterol levels.
Methods
Trial Design and Oversight
ORION-1 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled, phase 2, multicenter trial. The objec-
tive was to evaluate the effects of different doses 
and dosing intervals for the use of inclisiran. 
The trial was designed by the principal investiga-
tor (the first author) and the sponsor, the Medi-
cines Company, and was performed by the spon-
sor and World Wide Clinical Trials. Data were 
collected by the investigators, and data analyses 
were conducted by Statistics Collaborative and 
the Medicines Company. Ethics committee ap-
proval was obtained at all participating institu-
tions. The first two authors wrote the first draft 
of the manuscript; editorial assistance was pro-
vided by Greensplash and funded by the Medi-
cines Company. All the authors participated in 
revising the manuscript and vouch for the accu-
racy and completeness of the data and the fidel-
ity of the trial to the protocol, which is available 
with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.
Patients
Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria are de-
scribed in the Supplementary Appendix, available 
at NEJM.org. Men and women 18 years of age or 
older were eligible for participation in the trial if 
the LDL cholesterol level at screening was higher 
than 70 mg per deciliter (1.8 mmol per liter) (for 
patients with a history of atherosclerotic cardio-
vascular disease) or higher than 100 mg per deci-
liter (2.6 mmol per liter) (for patients without a 
history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease). 
Patients were required to have been receiving the 
maximum possible dose of a statin with or with-
out additional lipid-lowering therapy at stable 
doses for at least 30 days before screening and 
were required to have no planned changes in back-
ground therapy during the course of the trial. 
Any use at any time of a monoclonal antibody 
drug targeting PCSK9 was an exclusion criterion 
and was prohibited during the trial. Written in-
formed consent was obtained from all the pa-
tients before participation in the trial.

Trial Procedures
An interactive Web response system was used to 
randomly assign patients to one of eight study 
groups (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix); 
a single dose of placebo or 200, 300, or 500 mg 
of inclisiran on day 1 or two doses of placebo or 
100, 200, or 300 mg of inclisiran on day 1 and 
day 90. Study-group assignments were stratified 
according to country and current use of statins 
or other lipid-modifying medications. End-of-trial 
evaluations were conducted at day 210, with the 
exception of those for patients whose LDL cho-
lesterol levels had not returned to within 20% of 
the starting level. For these patients, evaluations 
were conducted at day 210 and subsequently at 
follow-up visits every 30 days until day 360 or 
until the LDL cholesterol level returned to within 
20% of the starting level (whichever came first).
Efficacy
Fasting blood samples were obtained at each study 
visit, and LDL cholesterol levels were measured by 
combining ultracentrifugation with precipitation 
(beta quantification)12 at Medpace laboratories that 
had been accredited by the National Heart, Lung, 
and Blood Institute Part III Lipid Standardization 
Program. A full description of the methods used 
to measure prespecified biomarkers is available 
in the Laboratory Analytical Methods subsection 
and Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix.
Safety
Data on adverse events, vital signs, clinical labo-
ratory values, and electrocardiograms were ob-
tained at specified follow-up visits through the 
end-of-trial visit (day 210). Adverse events were 
classified as mild, moderate, or severe by the in-
vestigator with the use of standard Medical Dic-
tionary for Regulatory Activities terms and according 
to system organ class. Injection-site reactions 
were an adverse event of special interest, and 
antidrug antibodies to inclisiran were evaluated.
Statistical Analysis
The primary efficacy end point was the percent-
age change from baseline in LDL cholesterol level 
at day 180. Secondary efficacy end points includ-
ed the percentage change in serum PCSK9 levels, 
lipid measures, and high-sensitivity C-reactive 
protein levels at day 180 and changes in these 
measures as well as in levels of LDL cholesterol 
at other time points.
A total of 480 randomly assigned patients were 
planned for inclusion in the trial: 60 patients in 
each of the six inclisiran treatment groups and 
in each of the two placebo groups (3:1 ratio of 
patients assigned to receive inclisiran or placebo). 
Under the assumption of a 15% dropout rate, the 
sample required would be 50 patients who could 
be evaluated in each of the six inclisiran groups 
and approximately 100 patients who could be 
evaluated in total across the placebo groups (for 
a total of ≥400 patients) to detect a 30-percentage-
point difference in the percentage reduction from 
baseline in LDL cholesterol level between at least 
one inclisiran dose group and its corresponding 
placebo group with more than 90% power.
The primary end point was analyzed as the least-
squares mean percentage change from baseline 
to day 180. This was calculated with a repeated-
measurement linear-effects model, which included 
study group, baseline value, scheduled follow-up 
visit, and the interaction of study group with 
scheduled visit. The analysis was performed 
with the use of the PROC MIXED procedure in SAS 
software with an auto-regressive variance structure 
that incorporates treatment at each visit as fixed 
effects and patients as random effects. For both 
the primary and secondary end points, P values 
were adjusted for multiple comparisons with the 
use of Dunnett’s test for comparison among the 
six inclisiran groups and the placebo comparator 
groups. Separate analyses were performed for 
each dosing strategy — that is, a single dose and 
two doses. The type I error significance level was 
0.05 for a two-sided test.
All patients who received at least one dose of 
inclisiran or placebo were included in the safety 
analysis (safety population). The prespecified mod-
ified intention-to-treat population was defined 
as all randomly assigned patients who received 
at least one dose of study agent and for whom 
both the baseline and the 180-day follow-up LDL 
cholesterol level measurements were available. An 
intention-to-treat analysis was performed with the 
use of imputation, as described in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix, for patients with missing data.
Time-course data are presented as means with 
95% confidence intervals. Variation in responses 
among patients is depicted graphically with water-
fall plots. Analyses were performed with SAS 
software, versions 9.2 and higher (SAS Institute). 
Full details of the statistical analysis plan are 
available at NEJM.org.

Inclisiran in Patients with Elevated LDL Cholesterol
Results
Patients
A total of 646 patients were screened, and 501 
patients were randomly assigned to one of the 
two placebo groups or one of the six inclisiran 
groups (Figs. S1 and S2 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). Of these patients, 497 received incli-
siran or placebo (1 patient each in the single-
dose 300 mg, single-dose 500 mg, double-dose 
100 mg, and double-dose 200 mg inclisiran groups 
did not receive an injection of inclisiran) and 
comprise the efficacy and safety populations. The 
baseline characteristics of the patients in each 
study group are provided in Table 1 and in Table 
S2 in the Supplementary Appendix. At study 
entry, 73% of the patients were receiving statin 
therapy, and 31% of the patients were receiving 
ezetimibe.
PCSK9 Levels
Fourteen days after a single injection of incli-
siran, PCSK9 levels were reduced from baseline 
levels by a mean of 59.6 to 68.7% across the 
range of inclisiran doses from 100 mg to 500 mg, 
whereas mean PCSK9 levels increased by 3.8% 
with placebo (Fig. 1A and 1C). At day 30, PCSK9 
levels were reduced further, to between 66.2 and 
74.0% below baseline levels, with similar reduc-
tions observed at day 60 and day 90. Among the 
patients who received a single-dose regimen, the 
mean reductions in PCSK9 levels at day 180 (a 
secondary end point) ranged between 47.9 and 
59.3% (P<0.001 for each dose vs. placebo) (Ta-
ble 2). In comparison, among the patients who 
received a two-dose regimen, further reductions 
in PCSK9 levels were observed after the second 
dose. At day 90, these patients had reductions of 
47.0 to 62.8%, and at day 120, they had reduc-
tions of 60.4 to 74.5%. At day 180, the mean re-
ductions from baseline in PCSK9 levels among pa-
tients who received a two-dose regimen ranged 
between 53.2 and 69.1% (P<0.001 for each dose 
vs. placebo) (Table 2). In association with both 
the single-dose and two-dose inclisiran regimens, 
the reductions in PCSK9 levels at day 240 were 
greater than 40% (Fig. 1A and 1C).
LDL Cholesterol Levels and Other Laboratory 
Measures
LDL cholesterol levels were already declining from 
baseline levels at 14 days after the first injection 
of inclisiran, and by day 30, the mean reductions 
in LDL cholesterol level ranged between 44.5 and 
50.5% below baseline across all inclisiran doses 
tested (Fig. 1B and 1D), with a nadir at approxi-
mately day 60 for the single-dose regimens and 
at day 150 for the two-dose regimens. The pri-
mary end point was the percentage reduction 
from baseline in LDL cholesterol level at day 180: 
the least-squares mean reductions were signifi-
cantly greater after a single dose of inclisiran 
(27.9 to 41.9% reduction) than in association with 
placebo (2.1% increase) (P<0.001 for all inclisiran 
doses with regard to the primary efficacy end 
point) (Table 2). At day 240, the mean reductions 
in LDL cholesterol level from baseline ranged be-
tween 28.2 and 36.6% (Fig. 1B).
After the second dose of inclisiran, LDL cho-
lesterol levels were decreased (with respect to 
levels at baseline) by 34.2 to 44.1% at day 90 and 
by 41.1 to 54.6% at day 120. The differences be-
tween the two-dose regimens and placebo with 
regard to the primary end point were significant: 
at day 180, the least-squares mean reductions in 
LDL cholesterol levels from baseline among pa-
tients who received a two-dose inclisiran regimen 
ranged from 35.5 to 52.6%, whereas the placebo 
group had an increase from baseline of 1.8% 
(P<0.001 for all comparisons vs. placebo) (Ta-
ble 2). Similar results were obtained with the use 
of imputation and an intention-to-treat analysis 
(Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). At 
day 240, the mean reductions in LDL cholesterol 
levels from baseline ranged between 26.7 and 
47.2% (Fig. 1D).
Among patients who received placebo against 
a background of the maximum possible dose of 
a statin, there was considerable variation at day 
180 in the changes in LDL cholesterol levels 
from baseline (mean [±SD] absolute difference, 
−0.7±25.6 mg per deciliter [−0.02±0.66 mmol 
per liter]) (Fig. 2A). In contrast, all patients who 
received two 300-mg doses of inclisiran had 
a decline in LDL cholesterol level at day 180 
(mean absolute change in LDL cholesterol level, 
Figure 1 (facing page). Effect of Inclisiran on PCSK9 
and Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL) Cholesterol Levels.
The data points are means, and the I bars indicate 
95% confidence intervals. The dashed vertical line in 
each panel indicates day 180, the day on which these 
end points were assessed.

Plus–minus values are means ±SD. Data are presented for the modified intention­to­treat population, which consisted of all patients who underwent randomization, who received at 
least one dose of study agent, and in whom both the baseline and day 180 LDL cholesterol measurements were available. The numbers of patients who were excluded because of miss­
ing data at day 180 were as follows: for the single­dose regimens, 1 in the placebo group (2%), 2 in the 300­mg inclisiran group (3%), and 6 in the 500­mg inclisiran group (9%); for the 
two­dose regimens, 1 in the placebo group (2%), 3 in the 100­mg inclisiran group (5%), 3 in the 200­mg inclisiran group (5%), and 6 in the 300­mg inclisiran group (10%). The P values 
for the treatment­by­visit interaction are 0.11 for the single­dose regimen and 0.07 for the two­dose regimen. This analysis is based on modeling percentage change from baseline with 
treatment, planned visits through day 180, the treatment­by­visit interaction, and baseline LDL cholesterol level.

Inclisiran in Patients with Elevated LDL Cholesterol
−64.2±20.7 mg per deciliter [−1.66±0.54 mmol 
per liter]) (Fig. 2B), and 54% of the patients had 
a reduction of 50% or more (see the Supplemen-
tary Appendix). In this inclisiran dose group, 5%, 
48%, and 66% of the patients had LDL choles-
terol levels at day 180 of less than 25 mg per 
deciliter (0.65 mmol per liter), less than 50 mg 
per deciliter (1.3 mmol per liter), and less than 
70 mg per deciliter (1.8 mmol per liter), respective-
ly. At day 240, the individual cholesterol levels 
remained lower than at baseline in the same 
patient group (Fig. 2C).
We found significant reductions in levels of 
non-HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein B and no 
significant change in levels of high-sensitivity 
C-reactive protein among patients randomly as-
signed to receive inclisiran. The percentage chang-
es from baseline for additional lipid measures are 
shown in Table 2.
Safety
Adverse events were reported in 76% of the pa-
tients who received inclisiran and in 76% of the 
patients who received placebo (Table 3). Most of 
these events (95%) were mild or moderate in 
severity (grade 1 or 2). The incidence of serious 
adverse events was 11% among patients who re-
ceived inclisiran and 8% among patients who 
received placebo. Two patients discontinued par-
ticipation in the trial because of adverse events: 
one because of a herpes zoster infection (placebo 
group) and the other because of influenza or naso-
pharyngitis (two-dose 100-mg inclisiran group). 
The most common adverse events (occurring in 
>2% of patients) were myalgia, headache, fatigue, 
nasopharyngitis, back pain, hypertension, diar-
rhea, and dizziness, and the incidences of these 
events did not differ significantly between groups 
receiving inclisiran and those receiving placebo. 
Injection-site reactions occurred in 4% of the 
patients who received a single dose and in 7% of 
the patients who received two doses (after one or 
both doses) of inclisiran (combined rate, 5%); 
injection-site reactions occurred in no patients 
assigned to placebo (Table 3).
Two patients had increased levels of hepatic 
aspartate aminotransferase (>3 times the upper 
limit of the normal range), one in the single-dose 
placebo group and one in the single-dose 300-mg 
inclisiran group; the patient in the 300-mg incli-

Inclisiran in Patients with Elevated LDL Cholesterol
siran group also had elevations in hepatic alanine 
aminotransferase levels. Two additional patients 
(one in the two-dose 100-mg inclisiran group 
and one in the two-dose 300-mg inclisiran group) 
also had elevations in alanine aminotransferase 
levels. All aminotransferase elevations were tran-
sient. There were no increases in bilirubin levels 
that occurred in association with inclisiran or 
placebo among patients who had normal levels 
of bilirubin at baseline, and no case met the 
definition of Hy’s law, which states that a patient 
is at high risk for a fatal drug-induced liver injury 
if given a medication that causes hepatocellular 
injury (not cholestatic injury) with jaundice. One 
patient was positive for antidrug antibodies be-
fore the first injection; no other cases of anti-
drug antibody were reported.
Two deaths occurred late in the trial. The first 
occurred in a patient who had been randomly 
assigned to the single-dose 500-mg inclisiran 
group and who had long-standing vasculopathy 
and frequent angina. He had a witnessed cardiac 
arrest and died at 104 days. The second death 
occurred in a man in the two-dose 200-mg incli-
siran group who had a thoracic aortic aneurysm 
repaired percutaneously after study entry and in 
whom a fistula and sepsis subsequently devel-
oped; he died 198 days into the trial.
Discussion
Among patients who had a high risk of cardio-
vascular disease and had high LDL cholesterol 
levels despite receiving the maximum possible 
dose of statin therapy, inclisiran treatment re-
sulted in a significantly greater reduction in LDL 
cholesterol levels at 180 days than did placebo. 
In a finding consistent with this result, as well 
as with the design of the drug, levels of PCSK9 
were also significantly reduced at 180 days among 
patients who received inclisiran.
The greatest reduction (52.6%) in LDL choles-
terol levels was observed in association with the 
two-dose 300-mg regimen of inclisiran, a reduc-
tion that is in a range similar to that achieved 
with monoclonal antibodies designed to target 
PCSK9. Changes in other lipid measures in pa-
tients who received inclisiran were also broadly 
concordant, in both direction and magnitude, 
with results reported among patients who received 
anti-PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies. In the two-
dose 300-mg inclisiran group, every patient had 
a reduction in LDL cholesterol level, with a mean 
reduction of 64.2 mg per deciliter (1.66 mmol per 
liter) at 180 days. At day 240, PCSK9 levels were 
56.1% lower and LDL cholesterol levels 47.2% 
lower than at baseline, with a mean absolute 
reduction in LDL cholesterol level of 58.9 mg per 
deciliter (1.52 mmol per liter). Taken together, 
these data suggest that inhibiting the translation 
of PCSK9 mRNA in the liver represents an alter-
native to targeting circulating PCSK9 and would 
almost certainly involve a lower injection burden.
Maintaining consistent and effective reductions 
in LDL cholesterol levels in the long term through 
the use of statins is, in part, hindered by adher-
ence. Variability in adherence can result in consid-
erable variability in the long-term, time-averaged 
reduction in LDL cholesterol levels achieved. A 
body of evidence now suggests that lower long-
term variability in causal biologic factors is asso-
ciated with a lower risk of cardiovascular dis-
ease.13-15 Hence, approaches that not only lower 
LDL cholesterol levels safely but also can main-
tain reductions consistently over time, when 
applied either in lieu of or simultaneously with 
statin therapy, are being sought.
The usefulness of targeting circulating PCSK9 
as a means of reducing LDL cholesterol levels 
and cardiovascular risk is demonstrated by the 
Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research with 
PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects with Elevated Risk 
(FOURIER) trial,16 in which evolocumab was 
shown to have efficacy in reducing major cardio-
vascular events (primary end point) and the com-
posite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarc-
tion, or stroke (secondary end point) in patients 
with established cardiovascular disease and elevat-
ed LDL cholesterol levels. However, this approach 
comes with a minimal injection burden of a 
3.5-ml injection 12 times per year, or a maximal 
burden of 26 1-ml injections per year, and it still 
remains unknown whether the LDL cholesterol–
lowering effects achieved with evolocumab and 
inclisiran will translate into similar reductions 
in cardiovascular events.
During 210 days of exposure to inclisiran, the 
rates of serious adverse events were 11% among 
patients receiving the drug and 8% among pa-
tients receiving placebo. Injection-site reactions 
were uncommon and occurred in 4% of the pa-
tients who received one dose of inclisiran and 
7% of the patients who received two doses of 
inclisiran; these rates are similar to the rates

Inclisiran in Patients with Elevated LDL Cholesterol
observed with monoclonal antibodies to PCSK917,18 
and are in contrast to the rates of 76 to 84% 
reported with first-generation antisense oligo-
nucleotides for LDL cholesterol reduction.19,20 
Symptoms of immune activation, which is often 
a concern with therapies targeting RNA, were 
rare in association with inclisiran; there were 
few instances of flulike symptoms and no ob-
served elevations in C-reactive protein. We ob-
served no effects on platelet levels among patients 
receiving inclisiran, in contrast to recent reports 
from studies of antisense oligonucleotides and 
other siRNA molecules.21 We observed transient 
elevations in hepatic enzyme levels in three pa-
tients receiving inclisiran.
A trial of this size and duration cannot rule 
out infrequent serious side effects or side effects 
that might emerge after a longer period of ob-
servation. Hence, patients in this trial will be 
offered the chance to enter an open-label long-
term safety study, although larger studies are 
clearly also warranted. The large majority of 
patients in the ORION-1 trial were of European 
descent: further study is warranted to determine 
whether inclisiran has the same effects in persons 
of non-European ancestry.
