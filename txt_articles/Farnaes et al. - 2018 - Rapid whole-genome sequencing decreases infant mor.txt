Genetic disorders are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in infants. Rapid whole-genome sequencing (rWGS) can diagnose
genetic disorders in time to change acute medical or surgical management (clinical utility) and improve outcomes in acutely ill
infants. We report a retrospective cohort study of acutely ill inpatient infants in a regional children’s hospital from July 2016–March
2017. Forty-two families received rWGS for etiologic diagnosis of genetic disorders. Probands also received standard genetic testing
as clinically indicated. Primary end-points were rate of diagnosis, clinical utility, and healthcare utilization. The latter was modelled
in six infants by comparing actual utilization with matched historical controls and/or counterfactual utilization had rWGS been
performed at different time points. The diagnostic sensitivity of rWGS was 43% (eighteen of 42 infants) and 10% (four of 42 infants)
for standard genetic tests (P = .0005). The rate of clinical utility of rWGS (31%, thirteen of 42 infants) was significantly greater than
for standard genetic tests (2%, one of 42; P = .0015). Eleven (26%) infants with diagnostic rWGS avoided morbidity, one had a 43%
reduction in likelihood of mortality, and one started palliative care. In six of the eleven infants, the changes in management reduced
inpatient cost by $800,000–$2,000,000. These findings replicate a prior study of the clinical utility of rWGS in acutely ill inpatient
infants, and demonstrate improved outcomes and net healthcare savings. rWGS merits consideration as a first tier test in this
setting.

INTRODUCTION
Genetic disorders and congenital anomalies affect ~6% of live
births, and are the leading reason for hospitalization and mortality
in infants.1–4 Of 14% of US newborns admitted to neonatal
intensive care units (NICU), those with genetic disorders have
longer hospitalizations and higher resource utilization.1,5 While
early etiologic diagnosis in such infants enables optimal out-
comes, it is exceptionally difficult to deliver for genetic diseases
since they number over 8000 and presentations are often atypical
from classical descriptions.6 Moreover, they represent the leading
cause of NICU and paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) mortality,
with most deaths following palliative care decisions. Family
counselling regarding palliative care often is impeded by absence
of etiologic diagnosis.7
Rapid whole-genome sequencing (rWGS) provides a faster
diagnosis, enabling precision medicine interventions in time to
decrease the morbidity and mortality of infants with genetic
diseases.6 Furthermore, rWGS facilitates end-of-life care decisions
that can alleviate suffering and aid the grieving process. However,
published evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of rWGS in
improving outcomes in infants is insufficient to endorse large-
scale implementation;8 It is limited to case reports, and one
retrospective study (Level III evidence).9 Examination of reprodu-
cibility is imperative. Here, we report such an examination.
RESULTS
Parents provided consent for 42 of 48 eligible infants (88%,
Fig. 1). While the intent was trio rWGS (parents and affected
infant), rWGS was performed on 29 trios and 1 quad (parents and
two affected siblings), nine mother–infant duos, and three
singletons.
Most probands were term births with normal weight (Table 1).
Fifty nine percent were Hispanic/Latino. Consanguinity was
uncommon (2%). The severity of illness was high: 71% were in a
regional
NICU,
PICU
or
cardiovascular
intensive
care
unit,
76% received respiratory support and 40% inotropic support.
Disease phenotypes were highly diverse (Table 1, S1). Most
presentations were complex, with several systems affected.
The most common presentation was multiple congenital anoma-
lies (29%).
While disease phenotypes were typically present at birth, the
median age at nomination was 62 days (range 1–301 days;
Table S5). The median time from admission to nomination was
5 days. The range of the interval between admission and
nomination varied from nomination at a prior admission (in two
infants) to 194 days. The median enrolment interval was 5 days
(range 0–62 days), and enrolment–receipt of proband blood
sample was zero days (range 0–6 days).

 Diagnostic sensitivity of rWGS and standard of care
rWGS diagnosed 19 genetic diseases in 18 of 42 infants (Fig. 1,
table S3). Of the patients who received a genetic diagnosis only 3
(6002, 6018 and 6024) had their phenotypes only partially
explained by the genetic findings. The remaining 16 diagnoses
completely explained the phenotype. All were confirmed with
standard genetic tests. Concomitantly, 33 (79%) of 42 infants
received 144 standard genetic tests, as clinically indicated
(table S6). The most common was chromosomal microarray
(CMA) (18 infants, 43%). The diagnostic sensitivity of standard
genetic tests (10%) was significantly less than rWGS (43%) (P
= .0026). rWGS identified all diagnoses made by standard genetic
testing. In addition, one infant was incidentally diagnosed with
adenovirus infection by metagenomic analysis of WGS (Supple-
mental Methods). Thus 19 (45%) infants received etiologic
diagnoses by rWGS. No diagnoses were considered false positives
by clinicians (diagnostic specificity 100%).
The most common presentations receiving diagnoses were
multiple congenital anomalies (six (50%) of 12 were diagnosed),
and neurologic (five (56%) of nine were diagnosed; Table 1). No
demographic or clinical characteristic was significantly associated
with diagnosis.
In seven (17%) very ill infants, rWGS was performed with two
day time to interpretation. The remaining 35 (83%) families
received rWGS using less costly methods with five days to
interpretation. In six families (33% of positive results) WGS
established a diagnosis for which a specific treatment was
available to prevent morbidity or mortality, thus prompting
results to be verbally, provisionally reported ahead of medically
accepted confirmatory testing. All were subsequently confirmed,
with specific therapy initiated before this confirmation.
Clinical utility
Specific changes in medical or surgical treatment occurred as a
result of molecular diagnoses (clinical utility) in 13 (31%) of 42
infants receiving rWGS (including all who received provisional
diagnoses, Table 2). Conversely only one child (2%) received
changes in care from standard genetic diagnostics (P = 0.0015).
Seven medications were started in five infants, and medications
were discontinued in two (excluding discontinuation of empiric
antibiotics prescribed in 82% of infants, Table 1). For example,
infant 6056, was diagnosed with megacystic microcolon intestinal
hypoperistalsis syndrome, which is lethal in most infants.10
Treatment with cisapride resulted in marked improvement in
gut motility, such that intestine transplant may not be necessary.11
In four infants (22% of diagnosed), surgical procedures were
changed. Three were major surgeries. In toto, rWGS-predicated
precision medicine was judged to have prevented morbidity in
eleven (61%) of eighteen diagnosed infants, compared with none
by standard of care (Table 2). Four infants (22% of diagnosed)
avoided major morbidity (discussed below; Table 2). Mortality
through median day of life (DOL) 430 was two (11%) of 18
diagnosed by rWGS (infant 6012 and 6034), compared with seven
(29%) of 24 infants who did not receive diagnoses (Table 1, S4).
Mortality was bimodal, with four deaths at DOL 29–35, and five at
DOL 209–561.
Impact of rWGS-associated precision medicine on healthcare
utilization
It has been previously shown that WGS, while an expensive test,
may actually decrease overall cost (particularly downstream cost)
of
diagnostic
evaluations
of
medically
complex
children.12
Although also appearing to reduce rather than increase costs in
our cohort, the impact of precision medicine could not be
quantified in seven of 13 infants without a group of matched
historical controls and/or long-term follow up (see Supplementary
Results). However, the short-term impact on healthcare utilization
was quantified in the remaining six infants (Table 3, Fig. 1). Infant
6011 (previously published13) was admitted at seven weeks of age
with persistent jaundice and poor weight gain. He was nominated
for rWGS, but Spanish consent forms had not yet been approved.
Despite extensive evaluation, the aetiology of cholestasis was not
identified. He was discharged after eight days, but readmitted four
days later due to α-fetoprotein levels of >200,000 ng/mL. rWGS
revealed a diagnosis of Niemann-Pick disease, type C1 (NPC1). He
started treatment with miglustat with plans for intrathecal
cyclodextran and remains without neurologic symptoms.13 Using
a modified Delphi method, the consensus of an international
panel of paediatricians was that, had rWGS been performed on his
first
admission,
the
second
admission
would
have
been
unnecessary.
Infant 6012 was admitted to the NICU at birth with congenital
heart disease (Shone’s complex) and congenital diaphragmatic
hernia. She had an extremely complicated course with multiple
surgical interventions, including post-cardiac surgery extracorpor-
eal membrane oxygenation, gastrostomy tube placement with
Nissen fundoplication, tracheostomy for respiratory failure, and
treatment for recurrent sepsis. She was enrolled on DOL 224,
shortly after the study commenced. A diagnosis of Coffin-Siris
syndrome was reported on DOL 250, at which time she had septic
shock, requiring inotropic support with multiple agents. A six
week course of intravenous antibiotics had been planned. Upon
diagnosis, in light of the prognosis, the family elected for comfort
care, and the patient expired that day. Time to death after
withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment is not commonly a
protracted event.14,15 The Delphi panel could not achieve

 consensus with respect to earlier election of palliative care if the
diagnosis had been known soon after birth. However, there was
consensus that without rWGS, NICU care and therapy for sepsis
would have continued until resuscitation was no longer possible.
Neonate 6014 was admitted to the NICU at birth with
respiratory distress. He was hypotonic and aspirated feeds,
resulting in gastrostomy tube placement. He was enrolled on
DOL 35, and a provisional diagnosis of Nemaline Myopathy was
communicated on DOL 42. The panel consensus was that having
the molecular diagnosis avoided the need for muscle biopsy, and
that it was reasonable to compare projected costs of this
procedure (from a matched control infant).
Infant 6026 was admitted to inpatient gastroenterology on DOL
76 with severe cholestasis. He was noted to have congenital heart
disease. On DOL 78 he developed respiratory distress and
metabolic acidosis, and was transferred to the PICU. He was
scheduled for intraoperative cholangiogram with reflex to Kasai
hepatoportoenterostomy on DOL 83 for evaluation of suspected
biliary atresia (see supplementary results). He was enrolled on DOL
80 and received a provisional diagnosis of Alagille syndrome on
DOL 83. This provisional diagnosis was reported to the operating
room immediately before induction of general anaesthesia for
intraoperative cholangiogram and Kasai procedure. The diagnosis
was confirmed by CMA several days later. Control infant 2 was

 admitted to inpatient gastroenterology with cholestasis one
month later, and underwent hepatoportoenterostomy for biliary
atresia, costs were included for an expected additional two days of
PICU recovery. Estimated rWGS-associated savings were $44,451.
Given that 90% of infants with Alagille syndrome have abnormal
intraoperative cholangiograms, the panel consensus was that he
had 83–94% reduction in mortality as a result of cancellation of
hepatoportoenterostomy, and 70–80% reduction in likelihood of
liver transplant.16–18 Estimates of the cost of a subsequent liver
transplant were based on an average charges of $812,50019 given
the typical 25% cost to charge ratio, estimated costs would be
$203,125. Based on two previous publications16,17 which showed
total of 14 out of 24 patients with Alagille who had a Kasai
requiring liver transplant compared with seven out of 46 patients
with Alagille syndrome without Kasai requiring liver transplant it
was estimated that Kasai increased rate of liver transplant by 43%.
Consequently the likelihood weighted saving was $87,344 for liver
transplant. Total estimated savings were $131,795.
Neonate 6041 was born by normal delivery at term, and
immediately admitted to the NICU for tonic-myoclonic seizures.
While seizures were largely controlled by phenobarbital, levetir-
acetam, and topiramate, she was too sedated to tolerate oral
feeds. Upon dose reduction, the seizures returned. Electroence-
phalogram revealed multifocal, epileptiform abnormalities, and
burst suppression. She was enrolled on DOL 1, and a provisional
diagnosis of Early Infantile Epileptic Encephalopathy type seven
was communicated on DOL 4. Carbamazepine was added to
levetiracetam,20,21 providing complete seizure control without
sedation, and she was discharged home on DOL 19, in time for a
family Christmas. Control neonate 3 was admitted to the same
NICU sixteen months earlier, with the same presentation and
molecular diagnosis. However, he was diagnosed by standard
tests, which took an additional six weeks to return, during which
he continued to have uncontrolled seizures. He has severe
developmental delay. His 59 day hospitalization cost $211,484.
An estimate assuming that the actual cost of $4,426/day for Case
6041 would have persisted for the additional 42 inpatient days,
produced estimated rWGS-associated cost savings of $181,481. At
thirteen months of age, she remains seizure free and has minimal
developmental delay. The panel consensus was that she avoided
likely neurologic damage associated with prolonged uncontrolled
seizures.20–24 Cost savings of preventing neurological devastation
were not calculated.
Neonate 6053 was transferred to the RCHSD NICU at birth with
hypoglycaemia and suggestion that she was the infant of a
diabetic mother. She was enrolled on DOL 5, and a provisional
diagnosis of focal hyperinsulinemic hypoglycaemia was commu-
nicated on DOL 12, indicating the need for surgical evaluation. The
median age at surgery for infants with focal hyperinsulinemic
hypoglycaemia is 78 days.25 Blood sugars remained brittle during
the hospitalization. Persistent or recurrent hypoglycaemia in
neonates with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycaemia is associated with
neurologic damage, epilepsy, and intellectual disability.9,25–27 She
had surgery on DOL 28, at least 21 days earlier than possible by
standard testing.25 The panel consensus was that it was reason-
able to compare Case 6053 actual utilization (Fig. 1b) vs actual
costs plus 21 additional days of NICU stay.
In total, in the six infants, rWGS improved the care of the
patients and reduced the costs by at least $803,200 (Table 3).The
current full cost of rWGS as a CLIA Laboratory Developed Test,
including indirect costs and treatment guidance, was $8482–
$22,128 (singleton, duo, trio, and quad, table S4). The total cost of
rWGS in 42 families was $674,645. Net of rWGS cost in the whole
cohort, inpatient cost was estimated to be reduced by $128,555.

 DISCUSSION
The systematic evidence for clinical utility of rWGS in infants with
likely genetic diseases, while dramatic, has been limited.9,13,28
Here, we report the impact of rWGS on clinical outcomes and
healthcare utilization in 42 infant inpatients. In contrast to two
prior studies, enrolees were predominantly Hispanic/Latino, and
enrolled from various inpatient settings, with 71% from intensive
care units. Forty percent received inotropic cardiac support and
76% received ventilatory support. Severity of illness and mortality
were similar to the prior study.9 This cohort was well suited to
examine clinical utility.
rWGS had a significantly higher diagnostic sensitivity (43%) than
standard of care (10%), in agreement with published rates of
diagnosis of genetic diseases by WGS (average 40%, range
32–57%).9,29,30 Of note, the diagnostic sensitivity was high despite
broader
enrolment
than
prior
studies.9
This
supports
the
diagnostic sensitivity of rWGS as a first tier test in a substantial
subset of infants admitted to children’s hospitals for reasons other
than prematurity.29,31
The types of genetic diagnoses herein were similar to prior
studies of symptomatic infants:7,9,32 Autosomal dominant dis-
orders were the most common, and causative variants were de
novo as frequently as inherited. There were no recurrent
diagnoses, reflecting genetic heterogeneity in inpatient infants.
From blood sample receipt to provisional diagnosis, rWGS is
possible in 26–48 h. Herein, however, median time from enrol-
ment to final report in the medical record was 23 days (range
5–69 days), similar to prior studies.9 Two factors slowed diagnoses:
first, confirmatory clinical testing was required before final
reporting (adding up to 16 days to time-to-report). Secondly,
not all rWGS was performed with the fastest methods, since it was
more than two-fold more expensive. In six acutely ill infants (33%
of diagnoses), provisional diagnoses were communicated before
confirmatory testing (median 7 days, range 3–12 days), since
treatments existed that could reduce morbidity or mortality. In the
prior two studies, only one infant met these criteria (3% of
diagnoses), and diagnosis was in 3 days.9 The clinical utility of
rWGS was measured by acute precision medicine interventions,
defined as a change in management which physicians agreed
resulted directly from the rWGS diagnosis and that occurred
promptly
after
reporting.

counselling, subspecialty consultation, or empiric antibiotics,13
(72%) of 18 rWGS diagnoses (31% of 42 infants tested) received
precision medicine. This concurred with prior studies.9,31 In a
paired test, the rate of clinical utility was significantly greater by
rWGS (33%, 11 of 33) than by standard of care (2%, P = 0.0015).
The most important measure of clinical utility is improved
outcomes. Herein, rWGS-based precision medicine was adjudged
to avoid morbidity in 26% (11) of 42 infants, major morbidity in
four (10%), and reduced likelihood of acute mortality by 43% in
one (2%). Two prior studies reported acute health outcomes of
rWGS or exome-based precision medicine in infants. They found
that major morbidity was avoided in 3% (four) of 115 infants, and
mortality in 3% (three).9,31 Two diseases identified in these studies
were also observed in this series, with the same avoided
morbidity: one was recurrent hypoglycaemia due to focal type 1
familial hyperinsulinism. rWGS enabled expedited partial pancrea-
tectomy, avoiding hypoglycaemic neurologic damage.9,25–27 The
other was Ohtahara syndrome, where rWGS enabled complete
control of seizures without sedation, potentially avoiding neuro-
logic damage.9,20–22,24 Thus, the magnitude and types of impact of
rWGS on outcomes in inpatient infants was replicated in Hispanic/
Latino infants in urban southern California.
In addition, the prior study showed rWGS to aid palliative care
decisions.9 Herein, diagnosis led to palliative care in one (6%) of 18
infants, less than that study (six (30%) of 20 diagnoses; P = 0.09).
When considering introducing new methods in healthcare,
improved clinical outcomes are the most important factors.
However, these outcomes must be considered in the context of
health care utilization and cost. To date, studies of genome-wide
sequencing have limited financial modelling to compare with the
cost of standard genetic tests.32 Here, we examined healthcare
utilization associated with precision medicine interventions in six
infants (46% of 13 receiving rWGS-associated precision medicine).
rWGS was estimated to reduce the length of stay by 124 days, and
inpatient professional and facility cost by at least $803,200. These
estimates are very conservative and reflect the judgement of a
Delphi panel (Supplemental Methods). For the palliative care
patient, the parents elected to end heroic measures once they
were aware of the genetic diagnosis. Had this finding occurred
earlier in the patient’s care it is possible palliative care would have
started earlier saving an additional $1.2 million. This would have
made gross savings from the study $2 million. In addition the
diagnoses that were made could have very likely been made with
proband only analysis which would have yielded a cost of
$356,244 for the sequencing.
There were several limitations to the cost analysis. First, it was
based on only six “case” infants, two historical “controls”, and
published literature values. However, since preparation of this
manuscript, we have studied the clinical utility of rWGS in an
additional ~250 infants. Amongst these, we have had two
additional diagnoses of early infantile epileptic encephalopathies
in neonates with status epilepticus, in which diagnosis resulted in
targeted therapy and prompt cessation of seizures akin to case
6041. We have had a second diagnosis of nemaline myopathy in a
neonate with hypotonia, who avoided a muscle biopsy akin to
case 6014. Second, consensus of a physician panel and the Delphi
method were used to judge the impact of precision medicine, and
may have been incorrect. Third, utilization was only calculated
during that hospitalization, with the exception of a rapid re-
admission in infant 6011, and a liver transplant in infant 6026.
Children with genetic disorders have substantial ongoing health-
care utilization. We did not include the likely avoidance of a gut
transplant in infant 6056, nor avoidance of neurologic damage in
infant 6041. Further, infant genetic diseases exert profound
emotional, financial, social, and physical stress within families.
These include parental divorce, depression and anxiety, and
sibling behavioral, developmental, and persistent health compli-
cations. The costs of these complications were omitted. Finally,
palliative care is not uncommon in regional NICUs, and decisions
are often delayed by absence of etiologic diagnoses.7 We did not
estimate the optimal rWGS-associated precision medicine sce-
nario, in which rWGS would have been ordered at time of
admission.
In conclusion, rWGS is a unique, high-cost healthcare innovation
that appears to improve healthcare outcomes while decreasing
cost of care. While rWGS merits consideration as a first tier test in a
subset of acutely ill inpatient infants, further studies are needed to
delineate clinical presentations for which outcomes are consis-
tently improved and optimal timing of rWGS orders and time-to-
result.
METHODS
Full methods are described in the Supplementary Material.
Study design
Retrospective comparison of clinical utility, outcomes, and healthcare
utilization of rWGS and standard of care (including genetic testing) was
approved by the institutional review board (IRB) at Rady Children’s
Hospital-San Diego (RCHSD) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA;
ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02917460; figure S1). Inpatient infants at RCHSD
without etiologic diagnoses, in whom a genetic disorder was possible,

 were nominated by diverse clinicians from 26 July 2016–8 March 2017.
Informed consent was obtained from at least one parent or guardian.
rWGS, interpretation, and reporting
Clinical features were extracted from electronic medical records (EMR,
table S1) and mapped to genetic diagnoses.13,28 Trio blood samples were
obtained where possible. rWGS was performed to ~45-fold coverage as
previously described.13,28 Structural variants were identified with Manta
and CNVnator, a combination that provided the highest sensitivity and
precision on 21 samples with known structural variants.33,34 Structural
variants were filtered to retain those affecting coding regions of known
disease genes and with allele frequencies <2% in the RCIGM database. If
WGS established a diagnosis for which a specific treatment was available
to prevent morbidity or mortality, this was immediately conveyed to the
clinical team. All causative variants were confirmed by Sanger sequencing
or CMA, as appropriate. Secondary findings were not reported.
Clinical utility and healthcare utilization
Acute clinical utility of diagnoses and impact on outcomes were evaluated
by EMR review, interviews with clinicians, published values, and consensus
of at least two paediatricians, one of whom was a relevant paediatric
subspecialist and one a medical geneticist. Outcomes were assessed until 9
October 2017.
The effect on healthcare utilization was modelled in six infants in whom
diagnoses changed treatment and outcomes, by comparing actual
healthcare utilization with that of a counterfactual diagnostic trajectory.
A modified Delphi method was used to establish consensus for counter-
factual trajectories.35 In five infants, the counterfactual trajectory was
molecular diagnosis following standard testing based on recent control
subjects from the same NICU prior to rWGS and/or literature values. Impact
was calculated by the proportionate increase pain length of stay multiplied
by the actual average daily utilization after one off tests such as MRI scans
were excluded. In one infant we considered a counterfactual trajectory as if
rWGS was ordered during a prior admission, with correspondingly earlier
implementation of precision medicine. In this infant, retrospective impact
was calculated by avoidance of the second admission. The cost of rWGS
was calculated, including pretest consultation, Sanger confirmation,
counselling, result disclosure, and precision medicine guidance (table S4).
Statistical analysis
Diagnostic sensitivity and the rate of clinical utility for standard care and
rWGS were compared using McNemar’s test for paired nominal data.
Fisher’s exact test was used to compare the rate of palliative care initiation
with another study. Two-tailed p-values less than 0.05 were considered
statistically significant.
