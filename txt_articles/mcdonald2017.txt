IMPORTANCE Many studies that found improved quality of life (QOL) after radiotherapy of
bone metastases have small sample sizes and do not use specific questionnaires. How soon
after radiotherapy one can expect an improvement in QOL is unknown.
OBJECTIVE To investigate QOL at days 10 and 42 after radiotherapy with a bone
metastases–specific QOL tool.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this secondary analysis of the NCIC Clinical Trials
Group Symptom Control Trial SC.23, a double-blind randomized clinical trial that investigated
dexamethasone for the prophylaxis of pain flare after radiotherapy, patients were accrued
from 23 Canadian centers from May 30, 2011, to December 11, 2014, and were followed up for
42 days after treatment. Participants referred for radiotherapy for bone metastases were
required to have a pain score at the site(s) of treatment of at least 2 (range, 0-10).
INTERVENTIONS Patients were treated with a single 8-Gy radiotherapy dose for 1 or 2 bone
metastases.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Patients reported their worst pain score and analgesic intake
at baseline and days 10 and 42 after treatment. Pain response was assessed with International
Bone Metastases Consensus Endpoint Definitions. Self-reported QOL was completed using the
European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire
Bone Metastases Module (QLQ-BM22) and the European Organisation for Research and
Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Core 15 Palliative (QLQ-C15-PAL) at the same time points.
RESULTS A total of 298 patients were accrued (median age, 68.8 [range, 32-94] years at day
10 and 68.0 [range, 34-90] years at day 42). A total of 122 patients (40.9%) responded to
radiotherapy at day 10 and 116 patients (38.9%) at day 42. At day 10, compared with
nonresponders, patients with a pain response had a greater reduction in pain (mean
reduction, 17.0 vs 1.8; P = .002) and pain characteristics (mean reduction, 12.8 vs 1.1;
P = .002), as well as greater improvements in functional interference (mean increase, 11.6 vs
3.6; P = .01) and psychosocial aspects (mean increase, 1.2 points in responders vs mean
decrease of 2.2 points in nonresponders, P = .04). Comparing changes in QOL from baseline
to day 42, responders had significantly greater improvements in the physical (mean increase,
6.2 vs −9.0; P < .001), emotional (mean increase, 12.3 vs −5.5; P < .001), and global domains
(mean increase, 10.3 vs −4.5; P < .001) of the QLQ-C15-PAL compared with nonresponders.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Forty percent of patients experienced pain reduction and
better QOL at day 10 after radiotherapy with further improvements in QOL at day 42 in
responders. A single 8-Gy radiotherapy dose for bone metastases should be offered to all
patients, even those with poor survival.

S
equelae of bone metastases, including pain, hypercal-
cemia, pathologic fractures, and spinal cord compres-
sion,cancausesignificantmorbidityanddecreasedqual-
ity of life (QOL).1,2 Radiotherapy is a key treatment modality
for symptomatic uncomplicated bone metastases. Studies3-6
have demonstrated its efficacy in relieving pain, with approxi-
mately 60% to 70% of patients experiencing benefit and
one-quarter to one-third of patients achieving a complete
response (CR), independent of whether single or multiple
fractions are prescribed.
Although reduction of pain is an important end point, pal-
liative-intent treatment should also focus on maintenance and
improvement of QOL.7 Understanding QOL has historically
been difficult because of its many dimensions and potential
confounding factors. More recently, tools have been de-
signed to measure the QOL of patients with palliative cancer
and,evenmorespecifically,thosewithbonemetastases.These
tools include the European Organisation for Research and
Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire
Core 15 Palliative (QLQ-C15-PAL)8 and the EORTC Quality of
Life Questionnaire Bone Metastases Module (QLQ-BM22).9
Because increased pain is associated with a lower QOL in
patients with symptomatic bone metastases,10 a reduction in
pain after radiotherapy is hypothesized to translate to an im-
provement in QOL. A few studies11-13 conducted to date have
demonstratedthis;however,manyinvolvesmallpatientpopu-
lations and do not use the bone metastases–specific QOL mea-
surement tools currently available. Furthermore, the time
points at which QOL have historically been evaluated are not
the same among all studies. Previous studies have found that
pain response may occur 1 week after radiotherapy14 and that
QOLimprovesbetween1weekand1month.13,15However,these
studies13-15 accounted for analgesics differently than what the
currentinternationalconsensusendpointdefinitionssuggest.16
Similarly, they did not use QOL instruments that were vali-
dated specifically for patients with advanced cancer and, in
particular,forthosewithbonemetastases.Theobjectiveofour
study was to investigate pain and QOL at days 10 and 42 after
radiotherapy using the QLQ-C15-PAL and QLQ-BM22 as mea-
surement tools. Specifically, we aimed to determine whether
there are differences in QOL between responders and nonre-
sponders as determined by the International Bone Metastases
Consensus Endpoint Definitions.16

wereaccruedfromMay30,2011,toDecember11,2014,andwere
followed up for 42 days after treatment. All participating cen-
ters received approval from their local research ethics boards

obtained from all participants, and all data were deidentified.
Allpatientswereprescribedsingle8-Gy(toconverttorads,
multiply by 100) radiotherapy to 1 or 2 painful bone metasta-
ses. Patients were randomized to receive two 4-mg tablets of
dexamethasone or 2 placebo tablets at least 1 hour before ra-
diotherapy, then every day for 4 days after radiotherapy. To
be eligible for participation, patients were required to have a
worstpainscoreofatleast2onascaleof0(nopain)to10(worst
possiblepain).Patientsreportedtheirworstpainscoreanddaily
opioid analgesic intake at baseline, days 1 to 10 after treat-
ment, and day 42 after treatment. Patient-reported QOL was
evaluated using the QLQ-C15-PAL and QLQ-BM22 at baseline
and days 10 and 42 after treatment.
ShortenedfromtheparentEORTCQOLQuestionnaireCore
30, the QLQ-C15-PAL contains 15 questions that assess QOL in
patients with palliative cancer.8 Five symptoms (nausea and
vomiting, dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, and constipa-
tion) are assessed as single-item symptom scales, whereas 2
symptoms (fatigue and pain) are assessed on multi-item symp-
tom scales. The questionnaire also consists of 2 multi-item
functional scales (physical and emotional functioning) and
1 question that pertains to overall QOL. Each question is rated
on a Likert scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 4 (very much),
except for overall QOL, which is assessed on a scale of 1 (very
poor) to 7 (excellent). All scores were linearly transformed to
a scale ranging from 0 to 100. Higher scores for the multi- and
single-item symptom scales indicate higher symptom bur-
den,whereashigherscoresforthemulti-itemfunctionalscales
and overall QOL indicate better functioning and QOL.

The QLQ-BM22 is a module designed specifically for
patients with bone metastases.9 It consists of 22 questions
divided into 4 subscales: painful sites, pain characteristics,
functionalinterference,andpsychosocialaspects.Similartothe
QLQ-C15-PAL, all items in the QLQ-BM22 are rated on a 4-point
Likert scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 4 (very much).
All items were linearly transformed to a scale ranging from 0
to 100. For painful sites and pain characteristics, higher scores
signify greater symptoms. Conversely, greater scores indicate
better functioning for functional interference and psycho-
social aspects.
Changes in the QOL scores reported using the QLQ-C15-
PAL and QLQ-BM22 were interpreted according to the guide-
lines suggested by Osoba et al.18 Changes in QOL scores were
calculatedafterallitemsweretransformedtoalinearscalefrom
0 to 100. Clinically meaningful changes were those that dif-
fered by 10 or more points from the baseline. For the symp-
tomdomainsoftheQLQ-C15-PALandQLQ-BM22(painfulsites
and pain characteristics), a decrease of 10 or more points in-
dicates less symptom burden, whereas an increase of 10 or
more points indicates greater symptom burden. On the other
hand, for the functional interference domains of the QLQ-C15-
PAL (functional scales and QOL) and QLQ-BM22 (functional
interference and psychosocial aspects), an increase of 10 or
more points indicates improvement, whereas a decrease of 10
or more points indicates deterioration. Pain response was as-
sessed according to the International Bone Metastases
Consensus Endpoint Definitions16 (eTable 1 in the Supple-
ment). Patients with CR and partial response (PR) were con-
sidered responders, whereas those with pain progression
or a stable pain were considered nonresponders.16 Overall
response was the sum of CR and PR.
Descriptive statistics were used to summarize baseline
demographic information. Differences in demographics be-
tween responders and nonresponders at day 42 were com-
pared using the χ2 test for categorical variables and 2-sample
ttestforcontinuousvariables.TheWilcoxonranksumtestwas
used to test for differences in baseline, day 10, and day 42 QOL
scores between responders and nonresponders. Similarly, the
Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to test the differences be-
tween responders and nonresponders in terms of the changes
of QOL scores between (1) baseline and day 10 and (2) base-
line and day 42. Differences between the patients with and
without clinically meaningful changes in QOL were com-
pared using the χ2 test. A 2-sided P < .05 was considered sta-
tistically significant. All analyses were conducted using SAS
software, version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc).
Results
A total of 298 patients were enrolled in the study (median age,
68.8[range,32-94]yearsatday10and68.0[range,34-90]years
at day 42). At day 10, 122 patients (40.9%) responded to radio-
therapy (37 CRs and 85 PRs), and at day 42, 116 patients (38.9%)
were responders (61 CRs and 55 PRs). Of the 298 patients, 215
(72.1%) had complete day 10 QOL data, and 187 (62.7%) had
complete day 42 QOL data. For the 187 patients with pain re-
sponse at day 42 with QOL data, prostate (54 [28.9%]), breast
(51 [27.3%]), and lung (43 [23.0%]) were the 3 most common
primary sites of cancer. Baseline worst pain scores ranged from
2 to 10, with 86 patients (46.0%) reporting a pain score of 7 to
10 at first site.
Of 187 patients with evaluable QOL data, 102 (54.5%) ex-
perienced a pain response at day 42. There were no statisti-
cally significant differences in baseline demographics (Table 1)
or QOL scores between responders and nonresponders at day
42 except for primary cancer site, with patients with prostate
cancerbeingmorelikelytorespondtoradiotherapy(40[39.2%]
of responders vs 14 [16.5%] of nonresponders, P = .007). Be-
tweenincludedandexcludedpatientswithnoday42QOLdata,
there were no statistically significant differences in most base-
line demographics except for primary cancer (54 included pa-
tients with prostate cancer [28.9%], 51 with breast cancer
[27.3%], 43 with lung cancer [23.0%], and 39 with other cancer
[20.9%] vs 20 excluded patients with prostate cancer [18.0%],
15 with breast cancer [13.5%], 41 with lung cancer [36.9%], and
35 with other cancer [31.5%]; P < .001) and Karnofsky Perfor-
mance Status (scores of 40-60, 27 [14.4%] included patients vs
41 [36.9%] excluded patients; scores of 70-80, 106 [56.7%] in-
cluded patients vs 59 [53.2%] excluded patients; scores of
90-100, 54 [28.9%] included patients vs 11 [9.9%] excluded
patients; P < .001) (eTable 2 in the Supplement).
Day 10
Comparing patients who had experienced a pain response on
day 10 with those who did not, there was no statistically sig-
nificant difference in baseline QOL scores. Patients with re-
sponse reported better physical functioning (mean [SD] score,
76.1 [24.8] vs 69.1 [26.3]; P = .03), less pain (mean [SD] score,
43.9 [25.4] vs 61.0 [27.9]; P < .001), and improved constipa-
tion (mean [SD] score, 25 [29.3] vs 35.9 [34.2]; P = .02) com-
pared with nonresponders.
On the QLQ-BM22, responders also reported fewer pain-
ful sites (mean [SD] score, 28.5 [16.5] vs 34.2 [18.5]; P = .03)
and pain characteristics (mean [SD] score, 31.6 [20.6] vs 44.6
[24.4]; P < .001) and improved functional interference (mean
[SD] score, 63.5 [20.6] vs 54.1 [23.9]; P = .007) compared with
nonresponders. The greatest difference observed was in the
pain item of the QLQ-C15-PAL, where responder-reported
scores were a mean of 17.1 points lower than scores reported
by nonresponders (mean scores, 43.9 in responders vs 61.0 in
nonresponders; P < .001) (eTable 3 in the Supplement).
When observing the change in QOL scores from baseline to
day 10, patients with a pain response had a significantly greater
reductioninpain(meanreduction,17.0vs1.8;P = .002)andpain
characteristics(meanreduction,12.8vs1.1;P = .002).Thisgroup
also experienced greater improvements in functional interfer-
ence (mean increase, 11.6 vs 3.6; P = .01) compared with non-
responders. A significant difference was observed in change in
thepsychosocialaspects,whererespondersimprovedbyamean

When patients were classified by clinically meaningful
changes in QOL (change ≥10 points), a greater portion of re-
sponders also had a QOL improvement in pain characteristics

(Table 2).
Day 42
Respondersandnonrespondersasdeterminedonday42didnot
have statistically significant differences in baseline QOL scores
on the QLQ-C15-PAL or the QLQ-BM22. Responders reported
better QOL scores in every item of the QLQ-C15-PAL except for
dyspnea(mean[SD]score,18.6[20.8]vs28.2[30.6];P = .06)and
insomnia (mean [SD] score, 24.5 [25.7] vs 33.3 [32.3]; P = .09).
In all domains of the QLQ-C15-PAL (physical, emotional, and
global), mean scores reported by responders were at least 10
pointsgreaterthanthosereportedbynonresponders,represent-
ing significant differences. The greatest difference between
respondersandnonresponderswastheirpainscore(29.9forre-

cal (mean increase, 6.2; P < .001), emotional (mean increase,
12.3; P < .001), and global domains (mean increase, 10.3;

Discussion
The international consensus end points take into account the
pain score and analgesic consumption,16 which lowers the CR
and PR rates when compared with the pain-only end points.19
Despite that, by intent-to-treat analysis, 40% of patients ex-
perienced pain reduction at day 10 after radiotherapy using the
international consensus end points in our study. To our knowl-
edge, this study is the first to report significant improve-
ments in certain domains of QOL in those who responded to
radiotherapyasearlyas10daysaftertreatmentforpainfulbone
metastases using the international consensus end points and
QLQ-BM22. At day 10, responders had significantly greater re-
ductions in pain and pain characteristics and better improve-
mentsinfunctionalinterferenceandpsychosocialaspectscom-
pared with nonresponders.

in nonresponders. Our study similarly found a significant dif-

tween responders and nonresponders in our study; however,
their study did not use the EORTC bone-specific module, the
QLQ-BM22, and patient questionnaire completion rates were
low (38% at week 1, 37% at week 2, 68% at month 1, and 40%
at month 2).11

ThestudywiththelargestpatientpopulationexploringQOL
changesafterradiotherapytopainfulbonemetastaseswasare-
cently published secondary analysis of the Dutch Bone
Metastasis Study.13 Patients were asked to complete several
questionnaires, including a pain scale, medication list, the
RotterdamSymptomChecklist,andavisualanalogscaleforgen-
eral health weekly for 12 weeks and monthly thereafter until 2
years, death, or study closure. A total of 956 patients accrued
between 1996 and 1998 were eligible for analysis. Responders
and nonresponders were observed to have significant differ-
ences in QOL at week 12 after radiotherapy: psychological dis-
tress, physical symptom distress, visual analog scale for gen-
eral health score, and overall evaluation of life score improved
in responders and deteriorated in nonresponders. In addition,
activity-level impairment deteriorated in nonresponders but
remained stable in responders.13 The authors report that these
differences were minimal immediately after radiotherapy and
increased with time until 12 weeks after treatment, when sig-
nificance was evaluated. Although their study was robust, our
studyfoundsignificantdifferencesatearliertimepoints,namely,
at day 10 after treatment for certain components of QOL and at
day 42 after treatment for most QOL domains.
Of interest, when patients with a pain response after ra-
diotherapyalsoexperiencedimprovementsinpsychosocialas-
pects at day 10, nonresponders experienced deterioration in
the same domain. Finally, the day 42 results of our study con-
firm previous findings that a greater proportion of those who
have a pain response after radiotherapy will also have a clini-
cally meaningful response in many QOL domains.11,13 In this
study, these items were pain, fatigue, constipation, painful
sites, pain characteristics, physical functioning, emotional
functioning,functionalinterference,psychosocialaspects,and
globalQOL.Becausethemainpurposeofradiotherapywaspain
relief, the most significantly improved QOL outcomes in the
present study were pain-related outcomes, such as pain char-
acteristics, number of painful sites, and functional interfer-
ence. The QOL items that were not expected to improve with
pain reduction, including dyspnea and insomnia, did not sig-
nificantly improve in responders. Thus, physicians should use
other more appropriate treatment modalities to address these
symptoms separately.
After rescaling the pain severity to 0 to 100 as that of the
pain item score in QOL, at day 10, a mean 20-point reduction
in pain severity and an 8-point improvement in QOL were ob-
served. At day 42, the magnitude in mean QOL improvement
increased to 20 points for a 20-point reduction in pain sever-
ity. In addition, more QOL items were improved at day 42 com-
pared with day 10. Therefore, although improvements in pain
may occur by day 10, QOL may require more time to improve
because it encompasses all aspects of well-being.
Limitations
Our study is limited by the attrition rates in follow-up at day
42, leading to a high exclusion rate as in most palliative trials.
In addition, the study patients may not be fully representa-
tive of all patients with short life expectancy.
Conclusions
Our study reports clinically meaningful improvements in pain
and QOL as early as 10 days after radiotherapy and more exten-
sive improvements in QOL at 42 days after treatment. These re-
sultsconfirmthatradiotherapyforpainfulbonemetastasescan
improve pain and QOL quickly after treatment and therefore
should be offered even for those with a limited expected sur-
vival.Ourevaluationtimepoints(days10and42)shouldbeused
in future studies that involve similar patient populations be-
cause they are more relevant than evaluating those with poor
expected survival at 2 or even 3 months after treatment.
