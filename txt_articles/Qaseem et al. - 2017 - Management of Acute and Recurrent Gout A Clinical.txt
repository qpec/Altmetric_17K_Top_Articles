 Management of Acute and Recurrent Gout: A Clinical Practice
Guideline From the American College of Physicians
Amir Qaseem, MD, PhD, MHA; Russell P. Harris, MD, MPH; and Mary Ann Forciea, MD; for the Clinical Guidelines Committee of
the American College of Physicians*
Description: The American College of Physicians (ACP) devel-
oped this guideline to present the evidence and provide clinical
recommendations on the management of gout.
Methods: Using the ACP grading system, the committee based
these recommendations on a systematic review of randomized,
controlled trials; systematic reviews; and large observational
studies published between January 2010 and March 2016. Clin-
ical outcomes evaluated included pain, joint swelling and ten-
derness, activities of daily living, patient global assessment, re-
currence, intermediate outcomes of serum urate levels, and
harms.
Target Audience and Patient Population: The target audi-
ence for this guideline includes all clinicians, and the target pa-
tient population includes adults with acute or recurrent gout.
Recommendation 1: ACP recommends that clinicians choose
corticosteroids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs),
or colchicine to treat patients with acute gout. (Grade: strong rec-
ommendation, high-quality evidence)
Recommendation 2: ACP recommends that clinicians use
low-dose colchicine when using colchicine to treat acute
gout.
(Grade:
strong
recommendation,
moderate-quality
evidence)
Recommendation 3: ACP recommends against initiating long-
term urate-lowering therapy in most patients after a first gout at-
tack or in patients with infrequent attacks. (Grade: strong recom-
mendation, moderate-quality evidence)
Recommendation 4: ACP recommends that clinicians discuss
benefits, harms, costs, and individual preferences with patients
before initiating urate-lowering therapy, including concomitant
prophylaxis, in patients with recurrent gout attacks. (Grade:
strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence)

G
out, one of the most common forms of inflamma-
tory arthritis, is caused by accumulation of excess
urate crystals (monosodium urate) in joint fluid, carti-
lage, bones, tendons, bursas, and other sites. Patients
experience joint swelling and pain during gout attacks,
known as acute gouty arthritis. In some patients, the
frequency and duration of acute attacks increase over
time and lead to chronic gout, which may be associated
with deposits of uric acid crystals known as tophi. Risk
factors for gout include overweight or obesity; hyper-
tension; alcohol intake; diuretic use; a diet rich in meat,
seafood, and high-fructose food or drinks; and poor
kidney function (1–4). About 3.9% of U.S. adults older
than 20 years report being told at some point that they
had gout (5). This percentage increased by about 1% in
the 10 years before 2007, probably because of a paral-
lel increase in conditions associated with hyperurice-
mia. An estimated $1 billion is spent annually on
ambulatory care for gout, largely on treatments and
prescription medications (6).
Management of gout includes both pharmacologic
and nonpharmacologic approaches. Pharmacologic
therapies focus on urate-lowering strategies and anti-
inflammatory drugs (Table 1). Nonpharmacologic man-
agement focuses on dietary and lifestyle changes, in-
cluding weight loss and exercise.
GUIDELINE FOCUS AND TARGET POPULATION
The purpose of this American College of Physicians
(ACP) guideline is to provide guidance on the manage-
ment of acute and recurrent gout in adults. These rec-
ommendations are based on a background evidence
paper (7) and a systematic evidence review sponsored
by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality
(AHRQ) (8). For guidance on the diagnosis of gout,
please refer to the accompanying ACP guideline (9).

 METHODS
Systematic Review of the Evidence
The
evidence
review
was
conducted
by
the
AHRQ's Southern California Evidence-based Practice
Center—RAND Corporation. Additional methodological
details can be found in the Appendix (available at www
.annals.org), as well as in the accompanying article (7)
and full report (8). Reviewers searched several data-
bases for studies published from January 2010 to
March 2016. Reviewers combined data when possible
using meta-analysis and assessed risk of bias and qual-
ity of studies according to established methods. The
study population included all adults (aged ≥18 years)
diagnosed with gout.
The review evaluated nonpharmacologic interven-
tions, including dietary interventions, dietary supple-
ments, and alternative treatments; pharmacologic inter-
ventions, including anti-inflammatory drugs, colchicine,
urate-lowering
therapies,
and
combination
drug
bxtherapies; and combinations of drug and dietary or
alternative treatments. Evaluated outcomes included
intermediate outcome of serum urate levels; health out-
comes, such as recurrence, pain, joint swelling and ten-
derness, activities of daily living, patient global assess-
ment, and development of tophi; and harms.
Grading the Evidence and Developing
Recommendations
This guideline was developed by ACP's Clinical
Guidelines
Committee
(CGC)
according
to
ACP's
guideline development process, details of which can
be found in the methods paper (10). The CGC used the
evidence tables in the accompanying systematic review
(7) and full report (8) when reporting the evidence and
graded the recommendations by using the GRADE
(Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Develop-
ment, and Evaluation) approach (Table 2). The authors
of the evidence review considered prior physiologic
knowledge and indirect and direct evidence when
grading the evidence (11, 12).
Peer Review
The AHRQ evidence review was sent to invited
peer reviewers and posted on the AHRQ Web site for
public comments. The guideline underwent a peer re-
view process through the journal and was posted on-
line for comments from ACP Regents and ACP Gover-
nors, who represent ACP members at the regional
level.

 acute gout from 5 randomized, controlled trials (RCTs)
(17, 18, 47–49). High-quality evidence showed that col-
chicine reduces pain in patients with acute gout (17,
18). Moderate-quality evidence from 1 study (17)
showed that lower doses of colchicine (initial dose of
1.2 mg followed by 0.6 mg after 1 hour) are as effective
as higher doses (1.2 mg followed by 0.6 mg/h for 6
hours) for reducing pain and are associated with fewer
gastrointestinal adverse effects (for diarrhea: 77% in the
high-dose group, 23% in the low-dose group, and 14%
in the placebo group). Colchicine is also associated
with other gastrointestinal adverse effects, including
nausea, vomiting, cramps, and pain (50), and is infre-
quently associated with headache and fatigue.
Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs
One placebo-controlled trial of tenoxicam (40 mg
once daily) showed that it reduces pain but is no differ-
ent from placebo for swelling in patients with acute
gout. High-quality evidence from 1 RCT (38) and ob-
servational
data
showed
that
nonsteroidal
anti-
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) reduce pain in patients
with
acute
gout.
These
drugs
have
known
anti-
inflammatory activity and have been shown to reduce
pain in many conditions. Further, they have been suc-
cessfully used to prevent gout flares during urate-
lowering therapy. The main harms of NSAIDs are gas-
trointestinal
adverse
effects
ranging
from
minor
(dyspepsia) to serious (perforations, ulcers, and bleed-
ing). Long-term use of higher doses can cause chronic
renal insufficiency.
Corticosteroids
There were no placebo-controlled trials of oral cor-
ticosteroids. High-quality indirect evidence suggested
that systemic corticosteroids reduce pain in patients
with acute gout. Although there was no direct evidence
assessing the efficacy of systemic corticosteroids to
treat
gout,
corticosteroids
have
a
proven
anti-
inflammatory effect and were shown to be equivalent to
NSAIDs for various outcomes in 6 RCTs (15, 24, 28, 35,
36, 40). Long-term use of corticosteroids is associated
with adverse effects that are dose- and duration-
dependent and affect almost all organs of the body.
These include dysphoria, mood disorders, elevation of
blood glucose levels, immune suppression, and fluid
retention.
Animal-Derived Corticotropin
Although no placebo-controlled RCTs were identi-
fied, moderate-quality evidence suggested that paren-
teral corticotropin reduces pain in patients with acute
gout. Corticotropin has known anti-inflammatory activ-
ity, and evidence from 2 comparative effectiveness
trials showed that it was similar to NSAIDs (29) and cor-
ticosteroids (30) for various outcomes. Harms of corti-
cotropin are likely similar to those for corticosteroids,
due to similar biologic activities.
Comparative Effectiveness (Benefits and Harms)
of Pharmacologic Treatments
NSAIDs Versus NSAIDs
Moderate-quality evidence from 16 RCTs (13, 14,
16, 19–23, 25–27, 31–34, 39) showed no clinically im-
portant differences in comparisons of different types of
NSAIDs with one another in patients with gout.
Corticosteroids Versus Corticotropin
One RCT (30) showed no difference in the duration
of acute gout attacks or the number of joints affected
when
comparing
corticotropin
with
intramuscular
triamcinolone.
Corticosteroids Versus NSAIDs
Six RCTs (15, 24, 28, 35, 36, 40) showed no differ-
ence in time to resolution of symptoms, clinical joint
status at follow-up, or pain reduction between NSAIDs
and corticosteroids. However, NSAIDs were associated
with more frequent gastrointestinal, nongastrointesti-
nal, and serious adverse events (46).
NSAIDs Versus Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors
Four RCTs showed no difference in pain, joint
swelling,
global
improvement,
and
health-related
quality
of
life
when
comparing
NSAIDs
and
cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors. Cyclooxygenase-2 inhibi-
tors were associated with fewer total adverse events
(38% vs. 60%) and fewer withdrawals due to adverse
events (3% vs. 8%) than NSAIDs.
NSAIDs Versus Parenteral Corticotropin
One RCT (29) showed that time to pain relief was
shorter with corticotropin than with indomethacin, 50
mg 4 times daily (3 vs. 24 hours). No adverse effects
were reported for patients treated with corticotropin,
whereas NSAIDs were associated with abdominal dis-
comfort or dyspepsia (55%) and headache (38%).
Effectiveness Based on Subgroups
No studies presented effectiveness data for sub-
groups based on sex, acute episode, history of gout,
HLA-B*5801 status, tophi, or comorbidities.

 DIETARY AND LIFESTYLE MANAGEMENT
OF GOUT
Effectiveness (Benefits and Harms) of Dietary
and Lifestyle Management
Evidence from 4 systematic reviews of RCTs (42,
51–53) and 2 new RCTs (54, 55) was insufficient to de-
termine the efficacy of dietary therapies on symptom-
atic outcomes. Low-quality evidence from 1 systematic
review (52) of 13 trials with high heterogeneity showed
that vitamin C supplementation reduced serum urate
levels (�20.8 μmol/L [�0.35 mg/dL] [95% CI, �39.3 to
�1.8 μmol/L {�0.66 to �0.03 mg/dL}]).
Low-quality evidence from 1 study (54) showed
that gout-specific counseling about dietary changes
(such as reducing intake of red meat, shellfish, and
yeast-rich foods and increasing intake of low-fat dairy
products, vegetables, and cherries) is not more effec-
tive than general dietary counseling (promoting weight
loss and reducing alcohol intake) for reducing serum
urate levels in patients with gout.
Evidence from 5 systematic reviews (41, 56–59) was
insufficient to determine the effectiveness of traditional
Chinese medicine, including herbs and acupuncture,
on symptomatic outcomes.
Effectiveness Based on Subgroups
There were no effectiveness data based on sex,
acute episode, history of gout, HLA-B*5801 status, to-
phi, or comorbidities.
PHARMACOLOGIC MANAGEMENT OF
HYPERURICEMIA TO REDUCE RECURRENT
GOUT OR OTHER HEALTH OUTCOMES
Effectiveness (Benefits and Harms) of
Pharmacologic Therapy
High-quality
evidence
from
4
RCTs
(60–63)
showed that urate-lowering therapy (allopurinol and
febuxostat) reduces serum urate levels. High-quality ev-
idence
from
2
RCTs
showed
that
urate-lowering
therapy does not reduce the risk for gout attacks within
the first 6 months. There were no long-term RCTs
that compared gout flares between patients treated
versus those not treated with urate-lowering therapy.
Observational evidence from follow-up of 2 RCTs
(64) and several retrospective cohort studies (65–67)
consistently showed that patients with lower serum
urate
levels
had
fewer
flares
than
those
with
higher
levels.
Together
with
the
fact
that
urate
crystalizes at a level greater than about 416 μmol/L
(7 mg/dL), the evidence is graded as moderate-quality
that longer-term urate-lowering therapy (>1 year) re-
duces gout flares. We consider the magnitude of this
reduction uncertain.
The most common adverse event with allopurinol is
rash. Most of the serious adverse effects associated
with allopurinol (≥40 years of history) are rare, mild,
and reversible; however, fatal hypersensitivity reactions
have also been reported with the drug (68). Persons
with the HLA-B*5801 haplotype, which is prevalent in
Asian persons (including those of Han Chinese and
Thai descent) and in Korean persons with stage 3 or
worse chronic kidney disease, may have an increased
risk for serious adverse effects with allopurinol (69–75).
The most commonly reported adverse events from lim-
ited trials of febuxostat were abdominal pain, diarrhea,
and musculoskeletal pain. There is more uncertainty
about the harms of febuxostat because there are no
large data-based studies and the clinical experience
with this drug is more limited than with older urate-
lowering medications.
Comparative Effectiveness (Benefits and Harms)
of Pharmacologic Therapy
Evidence was gathered from 4 high-quality system-
atic reviews (76–79) comparing the efficacy of febuxo-
stat and allopurinol. Gout flare incidence was higher at
high doses of febuxostat (120 or 240 mg/d) compared
with allopurinol (100 to 300 mg/d). There was no differ-
ence in gout flare incidence between lower doses of
febuxostat (40 or 80 mg/d) and allopurinol (100 to 300
mg/d). The evidence was inconclusive with regard to
changes in tophi. High-quality evidence from 1 RCT
showed no difference between febuxostat (40 mg/d)
and allopurinol (300 mg/d) for decreasing serum urate
levels, and 80 mg of febuxostat per day was more ef-
fective than either 40 or 300 mg of allopurinol per day
for decreasing serum urate levels (62).
Evidence comparing harms between allopurinol
and febuxostat was inconclusive, partly because of
limited
information
about
the
adverse
effects
of
febuxostat.
Prophylactic Therapy Against Acute Gout Flares
in Patients Initiating Serum Urate–Lowering
Therapy
High-quality evidence from 1 RCT (47) and obser-
vational evidence from 3 RCTs (60–62) showed that use
of low doses of colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily) or
NSAIDs for prophylactic therapy reduces risk for gout
attacks in patients initiating urate-lowering therapy.
Moderate-quality evidence from 1 RCT (59) and indi-
rect evidence from 3 RCTs (51, 52, 80) suggests that
use of prophylactic colchicine or NSAIDs for longer du-
rations (>8 weeks) is more effective at reducing gout
flares than use for shorter durations in patients initiating
serum urate–lowering therapy.
Effectiveness Based on Subgroups
Low-quality evidence from subgroup analyses of 1
RCT (81) showed no difference in the efficacy of fe-
buxostat or allopurinol for decreasing serum urate lev-
els based on age (82) or race (83). Evidence was insuf-
ficient for sex, baseline tophi, baseline serum urate
level, or comorbidities. No studies presented data on
HLA-B*5801 status.
Monitoring Serum Urate Levels in Patients
With Gout
No studies have assessed the effect of monitoring
serum urate levels in patients with gout on adherence
or treatment outcomes.

 Evidence was insufficient to conclude whether the
benefits of escalating urate-lowering therapy to reach a
serum urate target (“treat to target”) outweigh the
harms associated with repeated monitoring and medi-
cation escalation. There is no evidence from an exper-
imental study that examined the health outcomes of
treating to one serum urate level versus another, nor is
there a trial comparing a strategy of basing treatment
on attaining a specific urate level versus basing treat-
ment on reduction in symptoms (such as gout flares).
The evidence review looked for other studies to evalu-
ate whether achieving lower subsequent serum urate
levels (<297 vs. 297 to 416 μmol/L [<5 vs. 5 to 7 mg/
dL]) is associated with decreased risk for recurrent gout
attack, progression to chronic arthritis or disability, res-
olution of tophi, or other clinical outcomes. A post hoc
observational analysis (64) from 2 large trials (60, 61)
showed that patients who attained a urate level less
than 357 μmol/L (<6.0 mg/dL) had fewer gout flares at
12 months than those who did not (about 5% of pa-
tients with serum urate level <6.0 mg/dL vs. 10% to
15% of those with levels >6.0 mg/dL). Eight other ret-
rospective cohort studies (65, 67, 84–89) found similar
associations. Although these studies showed an associ-
ation between lower urate levels and fewer gout flares,
they did not establish that urate-lowering therapy
rather than other underlying patient characteristics
caused the reduction in flares. Further, even if urate-
lowering therapy does reduce gout flares, these studies
do not help us understand the tradeoff between the
magnitude of benefit and the harms and costs incurred
by treatment and monitoring. Thus, we remain uncer-
tain about the value of a treat-to-target strategy com-
pared with a strategy of basing treatment intensity on
minimizing symptoms.
DISCONTINUATION OF PHARMACOLOGIC
TREATMENT OF ACUTE OR CHRONIC GOUT
Treatment of Hyperuricemia
Evidence was insufficient to determine criteria for
discontinuing urate-lowering therapy. Three prospec-
tive observational studies (90–92) showed that urate-
lowering therapy can be discontinued without increas-
ing the risk for acute gout attacks in some patients, but
there were no applicable RCTs. One cohort study
showed that urate-lowering therapy can be discontin-
ued in asymptomatic patients who have maintained se-
rum urate levels less than 416 μmol/L (<7 mg/dL) after
5 years of treatment and in whom annual serum urate
levels remained below this level (91).
Prophylaxis During Urate-Lowering Therapy
Moderate-quality indirect evidence from compari-
sons of 3 RCTs (60–62) suggests continuing prophy-
laxis during urate-lowering therapy using low-dose col-
chicine or low-dose NSAIDs for more than 8 weeks to
prevent acute gout flares. Evidence showed that the
rate of acute gout flares approximately doubled when
anti-inflammatory prophylaxis was discontinued after 8
weeks (60, 61). Acute gout flares did not increase in a
trial that continued prophylaxis for 6 months (62).
SUMMARY
Evidence was insufficient for gout-specific dietary
advice or therapies (such as reduced intake of red
meat, fructose, and alcohol) to improve symptomatic
outcomes. Although 1 systematic review (52) and 1 RCT
(55) found that dietary changes reduced urate levels,
no study examined the effect of any dietary intervention
on clinical outcomes, such as acute gout flares. Low-
quality evidence showed that gout-specific dietary ad-
vice is similar to general dietary counseling with regard
to the effect on serum urate levels in patients with gout.
Evidence from placebo-controlled trials and head-
to-head comparisons showed that colchicine, NSAIDs,
corticosteroids (high-quality evidence for each), and
animal-derived
corticotropin
(moderate-quality
evi-
dence) are effective for reducing pain in patients with
acute gout. Lower doses of colchicine are as effective
as higher doses and are associated with fewer adverse
effects. Evidence also showed that NSAIDs are effective
as a class, regardless of choice of the individual drug.
Harms associated with colchicine include gastrointesti-
nal adverse events, such as diarrhea, nausea, cramps,
and vomiting. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are
associated with dyspepsia and potential gastrointesti-
nal perforations, ulcers, and bleeding. Corticosteroids
are associated with mood disorders and dysphoria, el-
evation of blood glucose levels, immune suppression,
and fluid retention. Corticotropin is less well-studied;
thus, harms are largely unknown but are likely to be
similar to those associated with corticosteroids due to
similar biologic activity. Fair prices are highest for cor-
ticotropin, and colchicine is currently the most expen-
sive nonbiologic.
High-quality evidence showed that urate-lowering
therapy does not reduce the risk for acute gout attacks
in the first 6 months in patients with gout. Observa-
tional evidence showed that patients who attained
lower urate levels after 1 year of urate-lowering therapy
had fewer gout flares. High-quality evidence showed
no difference between lower doses of febuxostat and
allopurinol for gout flares. The most common adverse
events are rash with allopurinol and abdominal pain,
diarrhea, and musculoskeletal pain with febuxostat. Fe-
buxostat is associated with higher costs than allopuri-
nol. High-quality evidence shows that prophylactic ther-
apy with low-dose colchicine or low-dose NSAIDs
effectively reduces acute gout flares in patients initiat-
ing urate-lowering therapy, and moderate-quality evi-
dence supports continuing prophylactic therapy for
more than 8 weeks. Evidence was insufficient about
whether urate-lowering therapy can be safely discontin-
ued after 5 years.
Evidence is insufficient for monitoring of serum
urate levels in patients with gout.
Target thresholds for serum urate levels rely on the
chemistry of urate, which is soluble up to a concentra-

 tion of about 404 μmol/L (6.8 mg/dL), above which pre-
cipitation may occur. However, this threshold is not ab-
solute because patients with higher serum urate levels
may still be asymptomatic, and some may have acute
flares below this threshold. Although there is an asso-
ciation between lower urate levels and fewer gout
flares, the extent to which use of urate-lowering therapy
to achieve various targets can reduce gout flares is
uncertain. The Figure summarizes the recommenda-
tions and clinical considerations.
RECOMMENDATIONS
Recommendation
1:
ACP
recommends
that
clinicians
choose
corticosteroids,
nonsteroidal
anti-
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or colchicine to treat pa-
tients with acute gout. (Grade: strong recommendation,
high-quality evidence)
High-quality evidence showed that corticosteroids,
NSAIDs, and colchicine are effective treatments to re-
duce pain in patients with acute gout. Gout symptoms
are mostly caused by inflammatory reaction to the de-
position of urate crystals, which results from an increase
in serum urate level above its saturation point in the
blood. Hence, most medications that are used to target
anti-inflammatory responses help to reduce the symp-
toms. Contraindications, harms, and costs vary among
treatments.
Corticosteroids should be considered as first-line
therapy in patients without contraindications because
they are generally safer and a low-cost treatment op-
tion. Steroids are among the most effective anti-
inflammatory medications available and have been
shown to be as effective as NSAIDs for managing gout,
with fewer adverse effects. Prednisolone at a dose of 35
mg for 5 days has been successfully used to treat acute
gout (15). Adverse effects associated with long-term
use of corticosteroids include dysphoria, mood disor-
ders, elevation of blood glucose levels, immune sup-
pression, and fluid retention. Corticosteroids are con-
traindicated in patients with systemic fungal infections
or known contraindications.
Moderate-quality evidence showed no difference
between different types of NSAIDs, including indo-
methacin. Adverse effects associated with NSAIDs in-
clude dyspepsia and potential gastrointestinal perfora-
tions, ulcers, and bleeding. Patients in whom NSAIDs
may be contraindicated include those with renal dis-
ease, heart failure, or cirrhosis. Although indomethacin
is commonly considered as the first-line NSAID for
treatment of acute gout, there is no evidence that it is
more efficacious than other NSAIDs, such as naproxen
and ibuprofen.
A generic formulation of colchicine is now available
for gout treatment, but it is still more expensive than
NSAIDs or corticosteroids. Adverse effects associated
with colchicine include gastrointestinal issues (such as
diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, cramps, and pain) and, in-
frequently, headache and fatigue. Colchicine is contra-
indicated in patients with renal or hepatic impairment
who are using potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors
or P-glycoprotein inhibitors.
Recommendation 2: ACP recommends that clini-
cians use low-dose colchicine when using colchicine to
treat acute gout. (Grade: strong recommendation,
moderate-quality evidence)
Moderate-quality evidence suggests that lower
doses of colchicine (1.2 mg followed by 0.6 mg 1 hour
later) are as effective as higher doses (1.2 mg followed
by 0.6 mg/h for 6 hours) at reducing pain and are
associated
with
fewer
gastrointestinal
adverse
effects.
Recommendation
3:
ACP
recommends
against
initiating long-term urate-lowering therapy in most pa-
tients after a first gout attack or in patients with infre-
quent
attacks.
(Grade:
strong
recommendation,
moderate-quality evidence)
Although evidence supports the benefits of using
urate-lowering therapy for shorter durations to re-
duce gout flares, the benefits of long-term use (≥12
months) in patients with a single or infrequent gout
attacks (<2 per year) have not been studied. Urate-
lowering therapy is not necessary in cases where the
patient would have no or infrequent recurrences. In
cases of recurrent gout (≥2 episodes per year) or
problematic gout (for example, gout associated with
tophi, chronic renal disease, or urolithiasis), shared
decision making with the patient is warranted to re-
view possible harms and benefits of urate-lowering
therapy.
Recommendation 4: ACP recommends that clini-
cians discuss benefits, harms, costs, and individual pref-
erences with patients before initiating urate-lowering
therapy, including concomitant prophylaxis, in patients
with recurrent gout attacks. (Grade: strong recommen-
dation, moderate-quality evidence)
After resolution of acute gout, some patients may
have recurrent episodes. Some patients have no or few
attacks over many years, whereas others have more fre-
quent attacks. Although evidence is inadequate to pre-
dict which patients will have more problems, those with
higher serum urate levels (especially >476 μmol/L [>8
mg/dL]) are at greater risk. Some may prefer to initiate
long-term therapy to prevent future gout attacks,
whereas others may prefer to treat flares if they occur.
Patients who decide not to initiate urate-lowering ther-
apy can revisit their decision if they have multiple recur-
rences of acute gout.
Febuxostat (40 mg/d) and allopurinol (300 mg/d)
are equally effective at decreasing serum urate levels.
However, these drugs are associated with adverse
effects, including rash with allopurinol and abdomi-
nal pain, diarrhea, and musculoskeletal pain with
febuxostat.
Data on the most appropriate duration of urate-
lowering therapy are insufficient. Moderate- to high-
quality evidence suggests that urate-lowering therapy
reduces the risk for acute gout attacks after 1 year, but
not within the first 6 months of treatment.

Summary of the American College of Physicians Guideline on Management of Acute and Recurrent Gout
Disease/Condition
Acute or recurrent gout
Target Audience
All clinicians
Clinicians should select from among corticosteroids, NSAIDs, or colchicine as first-line therapy on the basis of costs when
treating patients with acute gout who do not have contraindications to these drugs. Colchicine, including the current generic
version, is the most expensive of these medications. Clinicians should also carefully consider and discuss the benefits, harms,
and costs of initiating urate-lowering therapy with the patient immediately after an episode of acute gout and if the patient
has recurrent flares. The intensity of urate-lowering therapy and monitoring of urate levels should be based on
discussions with individual patients, given the uncertainties of different treatment strategies.
Target Patient Population
Adults with acute or recurrent gout
Treatments Evaluated
Dietary interventions; other lifestyle measures (smoking cessation, exercise, hydration); dietary supplements and alternative
treatments (vitamin C supplementation, traditional Chinese medicine); pharmacologic agents, including anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs, corticosteroids), colchicine, and urate-lowering therapies (xanthine oxidase inhibitors, uricosuric agents); combination
drug therapies; or combination drug and dietary or alternative treatments
Outcomes Evaluated
Efficacy, including short-term (pain, joint swelling, and tenderness) and long-term (serum urate levels, pain, joint swelling, and
tenderness) outcomes; activities of daily living; patient global assessment; recurrence; intermediate outcome of serum urate
levels; and harms
Benefits
Acute gout treatment (colchicine, NSAIDs, corticosteroids, corticotropin): reduction of pain
Prophylaxis during serum urate–lowering therapy (low-dose colchicine and low-dose NSAIDs): reduced acute gout flares
Harms and Adverse
Effects
Colchicine: gastrointestinal adverse effects, such as diarrhea, nausea, cramps, and vomiting
NSAIDs: dyspepsia and potential gastrointestinal perforations, ulcers, and bleeding
Corticosteroids: mood disorders and dysphoria, elevation of blood glucose levels, immune suppression, and fluid retention
Corticotropin: unknown, but probably similar to those of corticosteroids
Serum urate–lowering therapy:
   Febuxostat: abdominal pain, diarrhea, and musculoskeletal pain
   Allopurinol: rash and reactions (including potentially serious ones)
Recommendations
High-Value Care
Treatment of gout flares should be started as soon as possible for quicker resolution of symptoms.
Not all patients with elevated serum urate levels have gout symptoms or recurrent gout attacks, and some patients with urate
levels below the commonly identified threshold of 357 µmol/L (6 mg/dL) may have symptoms.
Allopurinol is associated with an increased risk for serious adverse events in persons with the HLA-B*5801 haplotype, which
is prevalent in certain Asian populations.
Clinical Considerations
Recommendation 1: ACP recommends that clinicians choose corticosteroids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs),
or colchicine to treat patients with acute gout. (Grade: strong recommendation, high-quality evidence)
High-quality evidence showed that corticosteroids, NSAIDs, and colchicine are effective treatments to reduce pain in patients
with acute gout.
Recommendation 2: ACP recommends that clinicians use low-dose colchicine when using colchicine to treat acute gout.
(Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence)
Lower doses of colchicine (1.2 mg followed by 0.6 mg 1 h later) are as effective as higher doses (1.2 mg followed by
0.6 mg/h for 6 h) at reducing pain and are associated with fewer gastrointestinal adverse effects.
Recommendation 3: ACP recommends against initiating long-term urate-lowering therapy in most patients after a first
gout attack or in patients with infrequent attacks. (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence)
Although evidence supports the benefits of using urate-lowering therapy for shorter durations to reduce gout flares, the
benefits of long-term use (≥12 mo) in patients with a single or infrequent gout attacks have not been studied.
Recommendation 4: ACP recommends that clinicians discuss benefits, harms, costs, and individual preferences with patients 
before initiating urate-lowering therapy, including concomitant prophylaxis, in patients with recurrent gout attacks.
(Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence)
Upon resolution of acute gout, some patients have no or few attacks over many years, whereas others have more frequent or
recurrent attacks. Febuxostat (40 mg/d) and allopurinol (300 mg/d) are equally effective at decreasing serum urate levels, and
prophylactic therapy with low-dose colchicine or low-dose NSAIDs reduces the risk for acute gout attacks in patients initiating
urate-lowering therapy.
NSAID = nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug.

 High-quality evidence showed that prophylactic
therapy with low-dose colchicine or low-dose NSAIDs
reduces the risk for acute gout attacks in patients initi-
ating urate-lowering therapy. Moderate-quality evi-
dence also showed that continuing prophylactic treat-
ment for more than 8 weeks was more effective than
shorter durations to help prevent gout flares in patients
initiating urate-lowering therapy.
AREAS OF INCONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE
Treatment Strategy for Patients With Gout
Receiving Urate-Lowering Therapy
A paradigm has developed that monitoring serum
urate levels and targeting therapy to achieve a specific
urate level (treat to target) reduces acute gout attacks
and subsequent joint damage. An alternative strategy
bases the intensity of urate-lowering treatment on the
goal of avoiding recurrent gout attacks (“treat to avoid
symptoms”), with no monitoring of urate levels. Com-
parative effectiveness studies that evaluate the incre-
mental benefits and harms of a treat-to-target strategy
over a treat-to-avoid-symptoms strategy should be a
priority.
Effect of Urate-Lowering Treatment on Adverse
Health Outcomes Beyond Acute Gout
The importance of decreasing urate levels to pre-
vent adverse health outcomes beyond acute gout is un-
certain.
Duration of Urate-Lowering Treatment
Insufficient evidence suggests that some patients
with annual urate levels less than 416 μmol/L (<7 mg/
dL) may be able to stop urate-lowering treatment after
about 5 years.
Treatment in Different Patient Groups
Evidence is insufficient to determine whether treat-
ment of patients with gout should vary according to
such variables as patient demographic characteristics,
comorbidities, gout severity, clinical presentation, or
laboratory values.
Effect of Dietary Treatments
Although many patients are counseled to change
various dietary factors or supplements, we found insuf-
ficient evidence to recommend these changes.
Long-Term Effects of Febuxostat
Although patients may be prescribed this medica-
tion for longer periods, we have little evidence about
its long-term benefits or harms.
HIGH-VALUE CARE
Clinicians should select from among corticoste-
roids, NSAIDs, or colchicine as first-line therapy on the
basis of costs when treating patients with acute gout
who do not have contraindications to one of these
drugs. Colchicine, including the recently introduced
generic version, is the most expensive of these medica-
tions. Clinicians should also carefully consider and dis-
cuss the benefits, harms, and costs of initiating urate-
lowering therapy with the patient after an episode of
acute gout and if the patient has recurrent flares. The
intensity of urate-lowering therapy and monitoring of
urate levels should be based on discussions with indi-
vidual patients, given the uncertainties of different
treatment strategies.

APPENDIX: DETAILED METHODS
The evidence review was conducted by the South-
ern California Evidence-based Practice Center—RAND
Corporation.
Key Questions Addressed
Key Question 1: Acute Gout Treatment
a. In patients with acute gout, what are the benefits
and harms of different pharmacologic therapies?
b. Does effectiveness (benefits and harms) differ
according to patient baseline demographic character-
istics
and
comorbid
conditions
(including
renal
function)?
c. Does effectiveness (benefits and harms) differ ac-
cording to disease severity, including initial clinical pre-
sentation (e.g., extent of joint involvement and time
since start of flare) and laboratory values (serum urate
[UA] levels)?
Key Question 2: Dietary and Lifestyle Management
of Gout
a. In adults with gout, what are the benefits and
harms of different dietary therapies and lifestyle mea-
sures on intermediate (serum UA levels) and final
health outcomes (including recurrence of gout epi-
sodes and progression [e.g., development of tophi])?
b. Does effectiveness and comparative effective-
ness of dietary modification differ according to disease
severity (including presence of tophi and baseline se-
rum UA level), underlying mechanisms of hyperurice-
mia,
or
baseline
demographic
and
comorbid
characteristics?
Key Question 3: Pharmacologic Management of
Hyperuricemia in Patients With Gout
a. In adults with gout, what are the benefits and
harms of different pharmacologic therapies on interme-
diate (serum UA levels) and long-term clinical health
outcomes (including recurrence of gout episodes and
progression)?
b. Does effectiveness and comparative effective-
ness
of
urate-lowering
therapy
differ
according
to disease severity (including presence of tophi and
baseline serum UA), underlying mechanisms of hyper-
uricemia, or baseline demographic and comorbid
characteristics?
c. What is the effect of dietary modification in com-
bination with pharmacologic therapy?
Key Question 4: Treatment Monitoring of Patients
With Gout
a. In adults with gout, does monitoring serum urate
levels with pharmacologic treatment and/or dietary
and/or lifestyle change measures (e.g., adherence) im-
prove treatment outcomes?
b. Is achieving lower subsequent serum urate levels
(<297 vs. 297 to 416 μmol/L [<5 vs. 5 to 7 mg/dL])
associated with decreased risk for recurrent acute gout
attack, progression to chronic arthritis or disability, res-
olution of tophi, or other clinical outcomes (including
risk for comorbidities or progression of comorbidities)
or patient-reported outcomes?
Key Question 5: Discontinuation of Pharmaceutical
Management for Patients Receiving Acute or Chronic
Gout Medications
a. In adults with gout, are there criteria that can
identify patients who are candidates for discontinuing:
i. Urate-lowering therapy?
ii. Anti-inflammatory prophylaxis against acute gout
attack, for patients receiving urate-lowering therapy af-
ter an acute gout attack?
Search Strategy
The systematic literature search included studies
published between 1 January 2010 and 1 March 2016,
identified using PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Li-
brary, and the Web of Science (also for unpublished or
non–peer-reviewed studies), as well as ClinicalTrials
.gov (from inception until 1 March 2016). Manufacturers
of prescription medications used to treat gout were
contacted in July 2014 for recently completed studies
and unpublished or non–peer-reviewed study findings.
Studies were not limited to those published in English.
Quality Assessment
The Cochrane risk-of-bias tool was used to assess
the quality of individual studies for risk of bias, and
AMSTAR (A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic
Reviews) was used to assess the quality of existing sys-
tematic reviews (93, 94). This guideline rates the evi-

 dence and recommendations by using the ACP's
guideline grading system (Table 2).
Population Studied
The population included all adults aged 18 years or
older with a diagnosis of gout.
Interventions Evaluated
Nonpharmacologic
Nonpharmacologic interventions included dietary
interventions
(low-purine
diet,
fructose
restriction,
other carbohydrate restriction, ethanol restriction, sour
cherry juice, dairy products and vegetables, Mediterra-
nean diet, and DASH [Dietary Approaches to Stop Hy-
pertension] diet), other lifestyle measures (smoking
cessation, exercise, and hydration), and dietary supple-
ments and alternative treatments (vitamin C supple-
mentation and traditional Chinese medicine).
Pharmacologic
Pharmacologic
interventions
included
anti-
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs and corticosteroids), col-
chicine, urate-lowering therapies (xanthine oxidase in-
hibitors and uricosuric agents), and combination drug
therapies.
Co-interventions
Co-interventions included combination drug and
dietary or alternative treatments.
Comparators
Comparators included placebo or usual care, other
interventions, usual diet or level of activity, and early
initiation of treatment.
Outcomes
Diet and Lifestyle Therapy
Outcomes included intermediate outcomes of se-
rum urate tests; health outcomes, such as recurrence;
and harms.
Acute Gout
Outcomes included efficacy, including short-term
health outcomes of pain and joint swelling and tender-
ness; long-term outcomes, including serum urate level,
pain, joint swelling and tenderness, activities of daily
living, patient global assessment, and recurrence; and
safety, including gastrointestinal and renal adverse ef-
fects, steroid-induced osteoporosis, and diabetes.
Chronic Gout
Outcomes included intermediate outcomes (serum
urate level), final health outcomes (pain, joint swelling,
tenderness associated with the development of tophi,
activities of daily living, patient global assessment, risk
for comorbidities or death, and recurrence of gout at-
tacks), and safety (inflammatory, hematologic, cardio-
vascular, liver dysfunction, and renal dysfunction).
Timing
Studies of short-term treatment (24 to 72 hours'
follow-up), long-term treatment (any follow-up time),
and
delayed
versus
immediate
treatment
were
included.
Setting
Studies in primary care settings, including urgent
care clinics and emergency departments, were in-
cluded. If evidence from primary care was limited, stud-
ies of patients in specialty clinics and emergency de-
partments were included.
Target Audience
The target audience for this guideline includes all
clinicians.
Target Patient Population
The target patient population includes adults diag-
nosed with acute or chronic gout.
Peer Review
The AHRQ evidence review was guided by a tech-
nical expert panel that included rheumatology and
general
medicine
specialists
and
methodologists.
These same consultants also examined and com-
mented on the draft final review. The draft final review
was posted on the AHRQ Web site for public com-
ments. The guideline went through a peer review pro-
cess through the journal and was posted online for
comments from ACP Governors and Regents. All com-
ments were read and carefully considered by the au-
thors, and important issues were also discussed by the
CGC.
Details of the ACP guideline development process
can be found in ACP's methods paper (10).
