Summary
Unrecognised postoperative residual neuromuscular block remains a frequent occurrence in recovery rooms. Evi-
dence indicates that current practice continues to perpetuate the status quo, in which 10–40% of patients experience
postoperative residual weakness. A departure from the current practice requires small efforts on the clinicians’ part.
This review addresses several selected core questions regarding neuromuscular blockade monitoring and provides a
framework to rationally discuss and develop basic guidelines for the use of neuromuscular blocking agents in patient
care.

Introduction
In the mid-1950s, inadequate recovery of neuromuscu-
lar function at the end of surgery was a common
occurrence.
It
was
termed
‘neostigmine-resistant
curarisation’ [1] and was attributed to mechanisms
such as depression of the acetylcholine cholinesterase
system rather than the failure of neostigmine to antag-
onise a profound block induced by d-tubocurarine [2].
Therefore, it is not surprising that the use of neuro-
muscular blockers during this time was associated with
a mortality rate that was six times greater (1:370
anaesthetics) than when neuromuscular blockers were
avoided (1:2100 anaesthetics) [3]. Noticeably, 63% of
deaths that involved the use of a neuromuscular
blocker were caused by respiratory failure.
In 1958, the use of a peripheral nerve stimulator
(PNS) was suggested for the diagnosis of prolonged
apnoea after the use of neuromuscular blockers [4]. In
1965, Churchill-Davison [5] opined, ‘The only satisfac-
tory method of determining the degree of neuromus-
cular block is to stimulate a motor nerve with an
electric current and observe the contraction of the
muscles innervated by that nerve.’ Although the ability
to monitor neuromuscular blockade has been available
for decades, clinical management of neuromuscular
blocking drugs remains suboptimal because the use of
intra-operative neuromuscular monitoring devices is
not routine [6] and patients still suffer from potentially
serious morbidity due to the residual effects of neuro-
muscular blocking drugs [7, 8]. This review addresses

 several selected core questions regarding neuromuscu-
lar blockade monitoring (Table 1) and provides a fra-
mework
to
rationally
discuss
and
develop
basic
guidelines for use in patient care.
Postoperative residual neuromuscular
weakness: how frequent is it and does
it matter?
The currently accepted definition for ‘adequate recov-
ery’ from neuromuscular block is the return of the
train-of-four (TOF) ratio to ≥ 0.9. It is believed that
this level of recovery restores the functional integrity of
the muscles involved in airway protection [9, 10].
Naguib et al. [11] conducted a meta-analysis of 24 tri-
als (3375 patients) that were published between 1979
and 2005 and noted that the incidence of postoperative
residual neuromuscular weakness (defined as a TOF
< 0.9) following the use of intermediate-acting neuro-
muscular blocking drugs was ~41%. Table 2 depicts the
various studies that document the incidence of residual
neuromuscular block in the past 10 years. The inci-
dence of short-term critical respiratory events in the
postoperative care unit is approximately 0.8% [12].
Thus, it is possible that > 100,000 patients annually in
the USA alone are at risk of adverse events associated
with undetected residual neuromuscular blockade [13].
Residual neuromuscular block is inherently associated
with increased risk of morbidity and patient discomfort
[7, 8], and increased length of stay in postoperative
care units/recovery [14]. Monitoring the effects of neu-
romuscular blocking drugs ensures their appropriate
intra-operative use [15], guides effective antagonism
and helps prevent residual neuromuscular weakness.
Why is there such a reluctance to use a monitor-
ing device routinely whenever a non-depolarising neu-
romuscular blocker is administered? In a survey of
anaesthesia providers, Naguib et al. [6] found that
19.3% of European and 9.4% of American anaesthetists
never use a device to guide management of intra-
operative
non-depolarising
neuromuscular
blockers.
These anaesthetists believe that they can safely manage
neuromuscular blockade without using a conventional
PNS (which requires the clinician to evaluate the
evoked response visually or tactilely; see Nomenclature
and definitions, below) or a quantitative monitor (that
measures and displays the TOF ratio in real-time)
[16]. A substantial proportion of anaesthetists in the
USA and Europe believe that their patients never expe-
rienced clinically significant adverse outcomes related
to residual neuromuscular block [6]. Evidence, how-
ever, contradicts these beliefs [16–19].
The 5th National Audit Project (NAP5) on acci-
dental awareness during general anaesthesia has con-
cluded that the use of neuromuscular blocking drugs
has been associated with a substantially high inci-
dence of unintended awareness during surgery in
paralysed patients [20]. In 2016, the Association of
Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland (AAGBI)
Standards of Monitoring recommended the use of a
monitoring device whenever neuromuscular blocking
drugs are used [21]. There is a growing interest in
establishing similar practice guidelines in different
European countries [22]. We need to recognise, how-
ever, that the impact of guidelines can be negligible
[23] unless they are supported by implementation
strategies [24, 25].

 Nomenclature and definitions
Monitoring can be broadly defined as undertaking and
analysing routine measurements aimed at detecting a
change in the environment or health status of a person
(population). It is clear from the voluminous literature
that the term ‘monitoring’ is misused. Therefore, a
brief discussion of the correct terminology is war-
ranted. Most of the published clinical and research
reports describe clinicians as ‘monitoring’ peri-opera-
tive neuromuscular function. In fact, in the vast major-
ity of publications, clinicians evaluate neuromuscular
function either by subjective means (i.e. clinicians
guess or estimate the strength of muscle contractions
in response to train-of-four stimulation by visual or
tactile means), or they infer adequate return of neuro-
muscular function by assessing clinical signs, such as
5s head-lift, tidal volume, grip strength or 5s leg lift.
Such evaluations are inaccurate and rarely protect
patients from residual weakness [26]. These evalua-
tions should not be termed ‘monitoring’ since they do
not involve actual measurement of function or analysis
of evoked responses. Objective assessment (i.e. mea-
surement of response and analysis) is the only type of
monitoring that will assure adequate return of neuro-
muscular function and patient safety, and should be
used in appropriate context [25, 26]. Similarly, there is
an important difference between peripheral nerve stim-
ulators (PNS) that clinicians use to stimulate a nerve
(and guess the adequacy of muscular responses), and
neuromuscular
monitors
(such
as
mechanomyo-
graphic, acceleromyographic, electromyographic and
kinemyographic devices) that measure and analyse
muscle responses (see below). From the preceding, it
should be clear that neuromuscular monitoring can
only be performed with objective monitors. Any other
assessment of muscle function (whether determined by
visual or tactile estimation or by clinical tests) has very
limited reliability and cannot assure patient safety.
Why monitor?
Monitoring neuromuscular function guides the clinical
management of neuromuscular blockade and helps to
minimise the incidence of postoperative residual weak-
ness. This can be achieved easily by using of a quanti-
tative monitor. If these devices are unavailable, the use
of a PNS, which requires the clinician to evaluate the
evoked response visually or tactilely, is strongly recom-
mended. The use of a monitoring device in all patients
who receive neuromuscular blocking drugs should not
be optional (and in the UK at least, no longer is). Evi-
dence indicates that residual neuromuscular block is
common [11] and that all clinical signs of recovery
such as the ability of a patient to lift his/her head or
sustain a hand grip for 5 s, are inaccurate and insensi-
tive (Fig. 1), and should not be relied upon to exclude
the presence of residual neuromuscular block [26, 27].
Tidal volume and vital capacity have returned to nor-
mal when the TOF ratio is between 0.4 and 0.6 [28],
and in a patient whose trachea is still intubated, vital
capacity and PaCO2 can be normal despite consider-
able muscle weakness. In such patients, tracheal extu-
bation can lead to airway obstruction and serious
morbidity and mortality.
A number of factors can complicate a patient’s
clinical reaction to neuromuscular blockers. First, most
patients appear to tolerate substantial and variable
degrees of residual block because of the existence of a
substantial margin of safety in respiratory muscles [29,
30]. For instance, in one study, none of the 12 volun-
teers experienced any airway obstruction or arterial
oxygen desaturation at a TOF ratio < 0.4 [28]. In
another study [12] that investigated the clinical conse-
quences of residual neuromuscular block, only a small
fraction of patients developed clinical manifestations of
residual weakness. The authors noted that the majority
of patients (91%) with evidence of residual block (TOF
ratio between 0.7 and 0.9) did not experience adverse
respiratory events [31]. The question remains, how-
ever: what happens to patients at risk, such as those
suffering from chronic obstructive airway disease or
sleep apnoea?
In addition, the variability in the duration of effect
for a specific dose among patients is a well-recognised
phenomenon (Fig. 1). The clinical duration of a typical
dose of rocuronium (0.6 mg.kg�1) during propofol–opi-
oid–nitrous oxide–oxygen anaesthesia has a median
duration of effect of 31 min in adults, but the duration
can substantially vary from patient to patient and range
from 15 min to 85 min [32, 33]. In another study, 10%
and 37% of patients 2 h after administration of an inter-
mediate neuromuscular blocker still had a TOF ratio
< 0.7 and < 0.9, respectively [34]. Recovery times after

 the administration of neostigmine are also variable. The
median time from the administration of 70 lg.kg�1of
neostigmine upon reappearance of the third tactile TOF
response until TOF recovered to 0.9 was 17.1 min
(range of 8.3–46.2 min) [35].
Genetic factors also contribute to the variability in
response to these drugs. For example, recovery of the
first twitch height to 90% of the baseline following the
administration of 1 mg.kg�1 succinylcholine ranges
from 6 min to 13 min in patients with genotypically
normal butyrylcholinesterase activity, vs. 9 min to
21 min in patients with low enzymatic activity [36]. In
patients with mutations in the butyrylcholinesterase
gene (BCHE), the duration of succinylcholine-induced
neuromuscular blockade can be several hours [37].
Patients with underlying disease (such as hepatic or
renal dysfunction) also show marked variability in
their response to drugs [38, 39]. In order to capture
the aforementioned variability in individual responses
to neuromuscular blocking drugs and hence, ensure
patient safety, the significance of using a monitoring
device becomes self-evident.
Peripheral nerve stimulation:
technological principles
Proper
evaluation
of
neuromuscular
response
to
peripheral nerve stimulation requires that minimal
basic criteria are met. This section provides an outline
for the desired characteristics for peripheral nerve
stimulation (Table 3).
Supramaximal stimulation. Why?
An action potential can be elicited when an electrical
stimulation of sufficient magnitude is applied to a
nerve. Every nerve is composed of many fibres that
vary in size, each with its own critical stimulating
threshold [40]. In order for a muscle to contract, a
certain minimum number of muscle fibres must to be
depolarised. As the current amplitude (in milliamperes,
mA) increases, progressively more muscle fibres are

count; TOFR, train-of-four ratio. TOFC and PTC can be assessed by subjective (tactile or visual) means using a
peripheral nerve stimulator (PNS). In addition to TOFC and PTC, a quantitative monitor measures TOFR. The time
range of recovery of clinical signs (e.g. head lift) and sustained response to 50 Hz tetanic stimulation is presented in
the yellow box. It is important to note that all the clinical signs of recovery from neuromuscular blockade are insensi-
tive and unreliable [26]. *At the deeper level, a higher dose of sugammadex (8 mg.kg�1) may be required ‘off-label’.

 depolarised, and the current at which sufficient muscle
fibres are activated to result in a detectable muscle
contraction is termed ‘threshold’ current. As the cur-
rent increases, more muscle fibres are depolarised –
the last ones being those with the highest threshold for
stimulation. Once all fibres in a certain muscle are
depolarised, any further increase in stimulating current
will no longer be able to recruit additional fibres. This
current intensity is termed, ‘maximal’ current. To
ensure that all fibres in a muscle will be depolarised by

 the stimulus despite changes in skin resistance over
time, the stimulating current is increased by 20–30%.
The resultant ‘supramaximal’ current will then assure
that all muscle fibres will continue to be depolarised,
and any subsequent decreases in the force of muscle
contraction (if any) are due to the effects of neuro-
muscular blocking drugs, and not changes in skin
resistance.
How strong should the stimulating current be to
achieve supramaximal stimulation?
In practice, stimulation should be increased gradually,
starting from 10 mA to 20 mA towards a level that
achieves the strongest repeatable muscle contraction.
This level should then be exceeded by 20–30% to ensure
the delivery of a supramaximal stimulation. A current of
40–70 mA is usually sufficient to provide supramaximal
stimulation in anaesthetised patients, although in some
patients, higher current amplitudes may be necessary
[41, 42]. According to Ohm’s Law, the current (I) is
directly related to the voltage (V) and inversely related
to the ‘resistance’ or impedance (R) (I = V/R). In the
presence of oedema [43] or in morbidly obese patients,
the impedance is substantially increased, and higher
currents may be required in order to ensure the delivery
of supramaximal stimuli. In fact, what is delivered to
the nerve is the charge (in microcoulombs, lC), which
is the product of current intensity (in milliamperes,
mA) and stimulus duration (in milliseconds, ms) [42].
A nerve stimulator that generates a constant current
is recommended because the stimulus intensity will not
be affected by variations in tissue impedance. In other
words, the stimulus current remains constant, with the
output voltage varying automatically as skin resistance
changes over time. In contrast, stimulators that are
designed to regulate voltage (constant-voltage devices)
will not guarantee the delivery of supramaximal stimuli
because the current delivered decreases as the skin
impedance increases (Ohm’s Law) during anaesthesia
[44] or when the batteries start to deplete. In such
instances, the clinician may overestimate the depth of
neuromuscular blockade.
Duration of the stimulus
The stimulus must be applied for a minimum duration
(should
not
exceed
0.3 ms)
in order
to elicit a
response but to avoid direct muscle stimulation. After
the nerve is depolarised there is a brief period during
which it is completely unresponsive to further stimuli
(refractory period). This is followed by a longer period
when only a stronger stimulus produces a response. If
the initial stimulus duration outlasts the refractory per-
iod of the nerve, it may re-depolarise the nerve so that
a second action potential is generated.
There is an inverse relation between the current
required to obtain a supramaximal response and the
stimulus pulse duration. A current intensity of 30 mA
generated by a stimulator that delivers a pulse duration
of 0.2 ms will result in a charge of 6 lC. In general,
charges of 12–15 lC are required for a maximal mus-
cle response, although some muscles have even higher
requirements [42]. Reducing pulse duration to a briefer
time (e.g. 0.1 ms) will require substantially higher cur-
rents (> 120 mA) to elicit a supramaximal response
[42], but such current intensities cannot be delivered
by any of the current nerve stimulators; their maximal
current output is 70–80 mA.
Characteristics of the stimulus
Ideally, the stimulus should be monophasic and have a
square waveform with an amplitude that rises and
decays rapidly. These characteristics reduce the possi-
bility of accommodation, when the activation threshold
of the nerve rises with a slowly generated stimulus. It
is also important that the stimulator produces only a
single monophasic pulse. Biphasic waveforms consist
of a repeating current pulse that has a negative phase
followed by a positive phase, and are not used for
monitoring neuromuscular function.
Frequency of stimulation
Higher frequencies of nerve stimulation generally pro-
duce a stronger mechanical response. Because there is
no refractory period for the mechanical event of mus-
cle contraction, a subsequent contraction can start
before any relaxation has occurred. The effect of
repeated stimuli within a brief period on muscle con-
traction is known as ‘temporal summation.’ If the fre-
quency of stimulation exceeds 30 Hz, fusion of the
individual muscle contractions occurs, and such a
response is called a tetanic response, which is charac-
terised by a sustained muscular contraction. Although
22

Naguib et al. | Basis of neuromuscular monitoring
 a tetanic contraction can produce a tension that is four
to five times greater than that produced by a single
maximal stimulus, tetanic contraction is associated
with muscle fatigue.
Patterns of nerve stimulation
For a summary of the most important characteristics
of the various neurostimulation patterns used in the
clinical setting, please refer to Table 3.
Single twitch (ST) stimulation
In unparalysed subjects, when supramaximal single
electrical pulses are applied to a peripheral nerve at
rates of 0.1 or 0.15 Hz (1 twitch every 10 s or 6.7 s,
respectively), they evoke single contractions (Fig. 2).
The proper use of ST stimulations requires standard-
isation and calibration of the ST amplitude before
the administration of a neuromuscular blocker in
order to have a valid comparison (‘baseline’ or ‘con-
trol’)
with
subsequent
responses.
This
pattern
of
stimulation is primarily used for determining the
potency (dose–response) of neuromuscular blocking
drugs. Higher frequencies of stimulation (e.g. 1 Hz)
will induce muscle fatigue and may result in the
overestimation of the potency of non-depolarising
neuromuscular blocking drugs [45]. This stimulus
pattern cannot differentiate between depolarising and
non-depolarising neuromuscular blockade. Subjective
evaluation of ST has little clinical application except
as
part
of
a
post-tetanic
twitch
count
(PTC)
sequence (see below).
Train-of-four (TOF) stimulation
This pattern of stimulation is composed of four stimuli
each separated by 0.5 s (a frequency of 2 Hz) delivered
to a peripheral nerve that will elicit four successive
muscular contractions in unparalysed subjects [46–48].
Train-of-four is usually repeated every 10–15 s and the
TOF ratio (TOFR) or ‘fade’ ratio is calculated by
dividing the amplitude of the fourth response (T4) by
the amplitude of the first response (T1); T4/T1. Unlike
ST, no control value needs to be determined for TOF
stimulation because TOF sequence measures the rela-
tionship between the fourth and the first twitches, thus
serving as its own control.
In the unparalysed individual, the TOF ratio is 1.0
(Fig. 3a) (when measured by mechanomyography or
electromyography only) and in the presence of a shal-
low block induced by a depolarising block (Fig. 3b).
During block induced by a non-depolarising neuro-
muscular blocking drug, TOF fade (the amplitude of
T4 is less than T1) can be detected (Fig. 3c); thus, the
TOF becomes < 1.0. After the administration of a
non-depolarising neuromuscular blocking drug, a pro-
gressive reduction in the amplitude of four twitches is
noticed (Fig. 3d) with the fourth twitch being most
affected. As the block progresses, the first response to
disappear is the fourth twitch, followed by the third,
second and finally the first twitch. This order of re-
appearance is reversed during the recovery phase (T1
is the first twitch to recover) (Fig. 3e). The TOF count
(TOFC) is defined as the number of evoked responses
that can be detected (0–4).

ered at a frequency of 0.1 Hz during normal conduction (Control, a); partial depolarising block (b); and moderate,
shallow or minimal non-depolarising block (c). Note the lack of fade between the first ST and subsequent ST evoked
responses during both depolarising and non-depolarising block when stimuli are delivered at this slow, 0.1 Hz fre-
quency. For this and other figures, the control value is that of the evoked mechanical response of the adductor polli-
cis muscle (in N) to a supramaximal stimulation of the ulnar nerve.

 In contrast with non-depolarising neuromuscular
blocking agents, succinylcholine, a depolarising neuro-
muscular blocker, causes a progressive reduction in
the amplitude of all four twitches of more or less the
same magnitude with virtually no fade (i.e. TOF ratio
is
maintained
around
unity)
until
all
twitches
disappear. The recovery phase follows the same pat-
tern (Fig. 3f). Train-of-four fade is only seen if phase
2 block develops when succinylcholine is administered
in large doses (usually > 3 mg.kg�1) [49].

Figure 3 Train-of-four (TOF) stimulation. Train-of-four (TOF) pattern in the absence of neuromuscular block (a,
Control). The TOF ratio (TOFR) is calculated as the ratio between the fourth twitch of the TOF sequence (T4) and
the first (T1). In the unblocked muscle, the TOF ratio is 1.0. During a partial depolarising block, there is minimal, if
any, fade such that the TOF ratio remains close to 1.0 (b). During a partial non-depolarising block, T4 decreases
preferentially, followed by T3, then T2 and lastly, T1. The decrease in TOF ratio from the normal ratio of 1.0 is
called ‘fade’ (c). In panel d, a set of two TOF stimuli are recorded, followed by administration of rocuronium. Over
the ensuing three sets of TOF stimuli, the TOF ratio remains at baseline (1.0), followed by progressive increase in
fade (decrease in TOF ratio) from 0.81 to 0.0 during neuromuscular block onset. During recovery of block (e), the
TOF ratio increases progressively towards 1.0. During recovery from 1.0 mg.kg�1 succinylcholine (f), there is no sig-
nificant fade in the train-of-four (TOF) response during recovery. At 8% recovery of T1 (the first twitch in the train-
of-four), the TOF ratio was 0.89 and at 96% recovery of T1, the TOF ratio was 1.04. Roc, rocuronium.

 measures and displays the TOF ratio in real time.
With the use of a quantitative monitoring device, one
can
also
discriminate
between
a
non-depolarising
(TOF fade present) and phase 1 depolarising (virtu-
ally no TOF fade) neuromuscular blockade (Fig. 3).
A TOF of 0.9 or more should be achieved before tra-
cheal extubation following the administration of non-
depolarising neuromuscular blocking drugs. Subjective
evaluation of TOF stimulation with the use of a PNS
requires the observer to determine (i) the number of
twitches (TOFC), and (ii) the strength of the first
response in the train and compare it with the fourth
evoked response by tactile or visual means. TOFC of
1, 2, 3 and 4 corresponds approximately to 10%,
20%, 30% and 40% of ST control twitch height [50,
51]. The limitation of TOF ratio is that once it
approaches 0.40, most clinicians cannot detect the
presence of fade by subjective assessments, and may
therefore not administer a reversal drug to ensure
adequate recovery of neuromuscular function before
tracheal extubation.
Train-of-four is the most appropriate mode of
neuromuscular assessment in clinical practice, and it
can be tolerated by awake patients in recovery and the
ITU the post-anaesthesia and intensive care units.
Brull et al. [52] reported that TOF stimulation can be
performed accurately using a submaximal current in
awake individuals once all four evoked responses are
present.
Tetanic stimulation (TET) and post-tetanic
twitch count (PTC)
A 5-s tetanic stimulation (TET) at 50 Hz is the most
common high-frequency stimulation pattern used in the
clinical setting. Post-tetanic twitch count (PTC) is
assessed by counting the number of responses when a
sequence of ST stimulation at 1 Hz is applied for 20 s
following a 5-s, 50-Hz tetanus [53]. In the unparalysed
subject, the mechanical response to a 50-Hz tetanic stim-
ulation is characterised by a sustained and intensified
contraction with no fade or post-tetanic potentiation
(Fig. 4a). Tetanic stimuli of higher frequencies (100–
200 Hz) are unphysiological as they may induce muscle
contraction fade even in the absence of neuromuscular
blocking drugs, and should not be used clinically [54–
56]. Tetanic fade (muscle fatigue) and post-tetanic
potentiation (increased muscle contractility) are charac-
teristics of non-depolarising block and phase 2 depolar-
ising block. Figure 4b–d illustrates that as the recovery
from deep non-depolarising neuromuscular blockade
progresses, the number and amplitude of PTC increases.
Tetanic stimulation results in an apparent acceleration
of recovery during the period of post-tetanic potentia-
tion (Fig. 5). This may have significant and important
clinical implications. Brull and Silverman [57] stated that
tetanic stimulation ‘. . .may lead to unnecessary repeated
administration of neuromuscular blocking agents, or at
the other extreme, to false estimation that adequate
neuromuscular
function
exists.’
Therefore,
tetanic
Figure 4 Tetanic stimulation and post-tetanic count (PTC). (a) In the unblocked muscle, the mechanical response to
a 50 Hz tetanic stimulation is characterised by a sustained contraction with no fade or post-tetanic potentiation. (b)
Application of tetanus during deep block resulted in a faint contraction for 5 s, and post-tetanic potentiation that
results in eight progressively weaker contractions (PTC = 8). Note that when measuring the PTC one always uses
1 Hz stimulation. (c) Single twitch is repeated every 12 s, followed by a 5-s tetanus, then decay to an amplitude
lower than the pre-tetanic single twitch amplitude. The pre-tetanic stimulus twitch amplitude is 16% of the control
value and the first post-tetanic twitch amplitude increased to 76% of the control value. (d) With further spontaneous
recovery of neuromuscular blockade, the tetanic and post-tetanic twitch amplitudes increase.

 stimulation should not be repeated for a period of 2–
3 min [57]. Train-of-four stimulation every 15 s, unlike
tetanic stimulation, does not potentiate subsequent neu-
romuscular responses after its application [58]. Tetanic
stimulation is painful and should never be applied to
awake subjects.
In the clinical settings, PTC is used to monitor the
depth of neuromuscular blockade when a deep block (a
PTC = 1 or greater; but a TOFC of zero) is required
until the end of a surgical procedure, as in open-globe
ophthalmic
surgery
under
general
anaesthesia
or
intracranial surgery [59, 60]. Post-tetanic twitch count
can also be utilised to roughly estimate the time needed
for the first twitch of TOF to recover from a deep block
[61]. Once the PTC approximates 10–12, a TOFC of 1
appears when intermediate-duration non-depolarising
neuromuscular blocking agents are used.
Mechanisms
Post-tetanic potentiation: A tetanic stimulus is associ-
ated with an increase in intraterminal calcium concen-
tration, which induces an increase in the mobilisation
of acetylcholine vesicles and fusion between vesicles at
the motor nerve presynpatic area [62, 63]. Exocytosis
of these fused vesicles increases quantal size [64]. The
net result is a transient increase in subsequent end-
plate potentials and temporary increase in the strength
of muscle contractions.
Fade: The mechanism of fade seen with repeti-
tive nerve stimulations as in TOF and tetanic stimu-
lations is poorly understood. It was proposed that
twitch depression and fade are a separate and inde-
pendent phenomena – twitch depression results from
the block of postsynaptic a2bde nicotinic receptors,
while fade results from the block of presynaptic
a3b2 nicotinic receptors [65, 66]. It has been sug-
gested that the presynaptic nicotinic receptors act in
a positive feedback mechanism to maintain acetyl-
choline release during repetitive nerve stimulation.
The
blockade
of
the
presynaptic
receptors
by
neuromuscular blockers prevents acetylcholine from
being made available to sustain muscle contraction
during high-frequency (tetanic or train-of-four) stim-
ulation. Because the released acetylcholine does not
match
the
demand,
fatigue
occurs
and
fade
is
observed in response to stimulation. This mecha-
nism, however, has been questioned, as fade also
appears to occur after the block of postsynaptic
receptors alone [67].
Double burst stimulation (DBS)
Double burst stimulation has been introduced as an
alternative to TOF stimulation in an attempt to
improve the ability to detect residual neuromuscular
blockade by subjective means [68]. The two commonly
used patterns are DBS3,3 and DBS3,2. The pattern
Figure 5 Tetanic stimulation results in apparent accel-
eration of recovery during the period of post-tetanic
potentiation. Train-of-Four count (TOFC) is 3 before
the tetanus and the recovery is falsely accelerated to a
TOFR of 0.30 due to post-tetanic facilitation.
Figure 6 Different patterns of stimulation (single
twitch at 1 Hz, double burst stimulation (DBS3,2) and
train-of-four). The pre-DBS twitch height was 14% of
the control value. The amplitude of the first stimulus
of DBS (D1) reaches 66% of Control amplitude. The
train of four ratio is 0.18.

 DBS3,3 consists of a mini-tetanic sequence of three
stimuli at 50 Hz, followed 750 ms later by an identical
sequence. The pattern DBS3,2 consists of brief three
50 Hz tetanic stimuli, followed 750 ms later by two
short 50 Hz stimuli (Fig. 6). The evoked responses fol-
lowing DBS are higher in amplitude than those elicited
by TOF, and because the subjective evaluation consists
of direct comparison of two sequential contractions (as
opposed to comparing the fourth and first responses
in a train of four rapid contractions), the subjective
evaluation
of
DBS-induced
fade
is
marginally
improved: this sequence generally can be used to
detect fade until the TOF ratio reaches 0.60 [69]. It
must be noted, however, that even this pattern of stim-
ulation is inadequate to ensure adequate recovery
(TOF > 0.90) by subjective means.
Is there a difference between the
various muscle groups in their
response to the administration of a
muscle relaxant?
Different groups of skeletal muscles perform different
functions and exhibit marked fibre heterogeneity at the
cellular and subcellular structures that reflect an adapta-
tion to the different patterns of activity. For example,
the myosin composition of the muscle fibres of the dia-
phragm is substantially different from that in leg mus-
cles [70]. Neuromuscular blockers are used as adjuvants
to anaesthetic drugs to achieve adequate relaxation of
the upper airway, vocal cords and diaphragm in order to
facilitate tracheal intubation and surgery. The depth of
neuromuscular blockade is typically assessed by stimu-
lating the ulnar nerve and monitoring the response of
Figure 7 Recovery characteristics of different muscles. Neuromuscular blockade develops faster, lasts a shorter time
and recovers faster at the laryngeal and diaphragmatic muscles than the adductor pollicis muscle, although the
laryngeal and diaphragmatic muscles are more resistant to neuromuscular blocking drugs. This figure depicts a
computer simulation based on Sheiner’s model [102] and data reported by Wierda et al.[103]. Concentrations
(panel A) and effect (panel B) over time for a 0.45 mg.kg�1 rocuronium i.v. bolus. The ED95 of rocuronium at
the adductor pollicis from this model is 0.33 mg.kg�1. Rocuronium 0.45 mg.kg�1 is given as a bolus at time zero.
Muscle X represents a muscle (such as the diaphragm, the laryngeal adductors, or corrugator supercilii muscle),
which is less sensitive to the effects of non-depolarising relaxants than the adductor pollicis muscle but has greater
blood flow. Panel A presents the predicted rocuronium plasma and effect site concentrations at the adductor polli-
cis muscle and muscle X. Note that that concentration of rocuronium reaches higher levels at a faster rate in
muscle X than in the adductor pollicis muscle. Panel B presents the predicted T1% as a percentage of control at
muscle X and the adductor pollicis muscle. The CE50 represents the effect site concentration at which there is a
50% probability of effect. The ke0 represents the micro rate constant for drug leaving the effect site compartment.
The Hill coefficient represents the slope of the effect site concentration vs. effect curve (not shown). In this exam-
ple, the concentration of rocuronium producing 50% block (EC50) of muscle X is 2.5 times that of the adductor
pollicis muscle, but the half-life of transport between the plasma and effect compartment (t½ke0) of muscle X is
only half as long. The rapid equilibration between plasma concentrations of rocuronium and muscle X results in
the more rapid onset of blockade at muscle X than at the adductor pollicis muscle. The greater EC50 at muscle X
explains the faster recovery of this muscle from neuromuscular block (faster rocuronium wash-out) than at the
adductor pollicis muscle.

 the adductor pollicis (thumb) muscle. Nevertheless, the
sensitivity of the diaphragm and airway muscles to neu-
romuscular blocking drugs is different from that of the
adductor pollicis muscle (Fig. 7). Therefore, the onset
and speed of recovery following the administration of
neuromuscular blocking drugs is dependent on which
muscle is being monitored [71, 72].
Airway muscles
Compared with peripheral muscles, the laryngeal and
diaphragmatic muscles are more resistant to the effects
of neuromuscular blocking drugs [71, 72]. Neuromus-
cular blockade develops faster, lasts a shorter time and
recovers faster at the laryngeal and diaphragm muscles
compared with the peripheral, thumb muscle. These
observations may seem contradictory because there is
also convincing evidence that the effective plasma con-
centration of the drug necessary to achieve 50% of the
intended effect (EC50) for almost all drugs studied is
between 50% and 100% higher at the diaphragm or
larynx than it is at the adductor pollicis (i.e. the dia-
phragm and the larynx are more resistant to the effects
of drugs than the muscles of the hand). This apparent
contradiction can be explained by the rapid equilibra-
tion
(shorter
mean
equilibration
half-life,
t½ke0)
between plasma and the effect compartment at these
muscles [73]. The greater total blood flow per gram of
muscle at the diaphragm or larynx results in a higher
peak plasma concentration of drug than at the adduc-
tor pollicis in the brief period before rapid redistribu-
tion is well under way (Fig 7).
Facial muscles
Stimulation of the facial nerve will evoke contraction
of the orbicularis oculi muscle (the eyelid) as well as
of corrugator supercilii muscle (the eyebrow). The cor-
rugator supercilii muscles follow the time course of
paralysis and recovery of the laryngeal adductor mus-
cles, while the orbicularis oculi muscles follow those of
peripheral muscles such as the adductor pollicis muscle
[74]. Monitoring of facial muscles is a poor substitute
for monitoring the adductor pollicis muscle. A recent
report showed a 52% incidence of residual paralysis in
the recovery room using subjectively assessed eyebrow
responses, compared with 22% incidence of residual
paralysis with hand muscle monitoring [75].
Where should we monitor?
Stimulation of the ulnar nerve and measuring the eli-
cited response at the adductor pollicis muscle is the
preferred site of monitoring neuromuscular function.
The ulnar nerve innervates the adductor pollicis,
abductor digiti quinti and first dorsal interosseous mus-
cles. Electrical activation of peripheral motor nerves
requires two electrodes to produce a current flow,
which are typically arranged in a monopolar configura-
tion. The stimulating electrode creates a localised elec-
tric field that depolarises the membrane of a nearby
nerve. In the monopolar configuration, the depolarising
(negative) electrode is placed distally 1 cm proximal to
the wrist crease on the radial side of the flexor carpi
ulnaris, while another is placed proximally on the volar
forearm as shown in Fig. 8 [42, 76]. This orientation
ensures maximal neuronal stimulation and muscular
response (Fig. 9) [42]. The evoked contraction of the
adductor pollicis muscle can be assessed by tactile
(Fig. 10) or visual means (subjectively) or recorded and
measured with the use of an appropriate transducer
and monitoring device, as described below.
If the hand is not accessible, stimulation of the
facial nerve may be used as long as the limitations of
facial muscle monitoring and potential confounding
variables associated with this monitoring site are fol-
lowed [75, 77]. The electrodes should be placed near
the stylomastoid foramen (just below and anterior to
the mastoid bone) (Fig. 11a) or just anterior to the ear
lobe (Fig. 11b) to evoke contraction of the orbicularis
oculi or the corrugator supercilii muscles. The evoked
response can be assessed tactilely (not recommended)
(Fig. 12) or quantified using an acceleromyography
transducer (Fig. 13). The stimulator electrodes should

 be placed along the ulnar nerve at the end of the sur-
gical procedure (once the patient’s hand becomes
available) to ensure adequate recovery of neuromuscu-
lar function before tracheal extubation.
An alternative site for monitoring when the hand
is not available is the posterior tibial nerve behind the
medial malleolus (Fig. 14); the response of the flexor
hallucis brevis is assessed by subjective (plantar flexion
of the foot, not recommended) or objective means
such as acceleromyography (Fig. 15) [78].
Quantitative modalities
Having described the key differences between peripheral
nerve stimulators (PNS) and neuromuscular monitors,
we will concentrate on describing the various types of
technologies that can be used to stimulate, analyse,
record and display (‘monitor’) neuromuscular function.
Acceleromyography (AMG)
Acceleromyography has been in clinical use for three
decades, and it is based on Newton’s Second Law
(Force = mass 9 acceleration): the force of muscle
contraction is proportional to acceleration, as mass
remains
constant.
Acceleromyography
involves
measurement of the acceleration of a muscle (usually
the adductor pollicis) in response to nerve (usually the
ulnar) stimulation (Fig. 16). If the hand is not avail-
able for monitoring the adductor pollicis muscle, other
sites can be used. The flexor hallucis longus (toe) mus-
cle in response to posterior tibial nerve innervation
can be measured (Fig. 15), or the orbicularis oculi or
corrugator supercilii muscles can be measured in
response to facial nerve stimulation (Fig. 13).
Although acceleromyography has de facto become
the ‘standard’ of clinical care, it has significant limita-
tions that continue to prevent the technology from
achieving wide clinical adoption [79]. In addition to
the need for pre-use calibration, AMG monitors can-
not be used clinically when unencumbered movement
of the thumb is not assured, such as surgical proce-
dures in which the arms are placed at the patient’s side
under surgical drapes. A work-around may be to pro-
tect the monitored arm and thumb inside a TOF-tube,
but the limits of agreement between mechanomyogra-
phy (see below) and AMG were in the range of -19%
to +24% when the TOF ratio was 0.9 [80]. Further-
more, the use of the recommended Hand Adapter that
maintains a preload to improve precision [81] also
increases the average control TOF ratios from 1.07 (no
pre-load) to 1.13 (with a significant range between
TOF = 1.01–1.23). This significant overshoot of the
baseline TOF measured with AMG, the so-called ‘re-
verse fade’ [82, 83] prompted the recommendation to

cular responses at the adductor pollicis (thumb) mus-

 consider a TOF > 1.0 as minimum recovery threshold
when a calibrated AMG is used [79]. Similarly, when
comparing AMG obtained evoked responses to those
obtained with EMG, the AMG TOF ratio is signifi-
cantly higher than the EMG TOF [82] (Fig. 17).
Despite its limitations, the strength of AMG is that
it can continuously record, analyse and display impor-
tant parameters, such as ST and TOF, making it usable
for the clinician and facilitating a rational approach to
administration of neuromuscular blocking agents and
their antagonists (Fig. 18).
Mechanomyography (MMG)
Mechanomyography is based on the measurement of
the force of muscular contraction in response to
nerve
activation.
Most
commonly,
the
thumb
is
placed in a holder that is attached to a force trans-
ducer (Fig. 19), and the force of thumb adduction
resulting from ulnar nerve stimulation is recorded
and measured. Although it has long been considered
the standard of neuromuscular monitoring, the MMG
set-up is cumbersome to use, bulky, and similar to
AMG, it requires unencumbered thumb movement
[84]. Additionally, MMG requires stringent prepara-
tion and maintenance of a constant preload; it is very
sensitive to repetitive stimulation and MMG-mea-
sured force of contraction increases as much as 35–
50% in the first few minutes of stimulation [85]. For
these reasons, MMG as a method of measurement of
neuromuscular function in the clinical setting has
been abandoned.

tive electrode is distal to the positive electrode) will
result in contraction of the eye muscles, which is mea-
sured by the accelerometer. The results are displayed
on the monitor’s screen.

 Kinemyography (KMG)
Kinemyography is based on a mechanosensor strip
that contains a piezoelectric polymer. The strip is
placed between the base of the thumb and the base of
the index finger (Fig. 20), and when the thumb
adducts in response to ulnar nerve stimulation, the
polymer strip generates an electrical current that is
proportional to the degree of bending. The KMG is
simple to use clinically, but the results obtained are
not interchangeable with other monitoring technolo-
gies. For instance, the TOF ratio of 0.90 obtained with
KMG is equivalent with an EMG TOF of 0.80 (with
TOF limits of agreement of 0.65–1.0) [86]. With
repeated use, the mechanosensor strip may slide out of
its intended location, and clinicians may tape the strip
in place. Although this procedure maintains the strip
in its intended location, the tape may actually also
interfere with accurate measurement of responses.
Despite this limitation, KMG is an easy to use technol-
ogy that will give the clinician much more reliable
information than that obtained subjectively, and its use
is recommended.
Electromyography (EMG)
Electromyography is one of the oldest technologies
used for monitoring the neuromuscular function. Like
the other technologies, it involves stimulation of a
peripheral nerve and measurement of the muscle
action potential (MAP) that is generated by the
contraction
of
the
innervated
muscle
(Fig. 21).

measured. The results are displayed on the monitor’s
screen.

 Electromyography measures an electrical event that
occurs at the neuromuscular junction: the activation of
postsynaptic receptors by acetylcholine (a chemical
process) that converts it to a mechanical response (ex-
citation–contraction coupling that results in muscle
contraction). For this reason, EMG is less prone to
interference from presynaptic or postsynaptic events,
and is likely a better indicator of pure neuromuscular
function.
In contrast with monitoring of MMG, in which
repetitive stimulation may induce an amplification of
responses, EMG amplitude is stable over time, decreas-
ing less than 2% per hour during constant stimulation
[85]. Similarly, temperature affects the EMG amplitude
to a much lesser extent than it affects MMG: EMG
amplitude increases by 2–3% for every 1°C tempera-
ture decrease [85]. Much like the subtle differences in
TOF ratios measured with KMG compared with EMG
there is also a difference between responses obtained
with EMG and MMG, although this difference may be
clinically insignificant [87].
What are the specifications of the ideal
monitor?
The ideal neuromuscular monitor would not have the
current limitations. It would be portable so it could be

acceleromyographic (AMG) twitch height (T1) as a
function of the train-of-four (TOF) fade ratio. Note
that at 95% recovery of T1, TOF ratio is higher as
measured by AMG than by EMG (~0.88 vs. ~0.68,
respectively) because acceleromyographic TOF values
tend to overestimate the extent of EMG recovery.

Monitor software. Time course of 0.3 mg.kg�1 rocuro-
nium dose is shown on the lower panel. The control
acceleromyographic TOF response is at the extreme
left of the lower panel (the train-of-four ratio, TOFR,
is shown as red dots as 100%). In the upper panel, the
highlighted time (in blue) indicates that the TOFR at
that time is 0.38 (or 38%, where T4/T1 = 24/62). The
actual recordings corresponding to this time are indi-
cated by the black markers on both the middle and
lower panels. Please note that the single twitch returns
to baseline before the TOF ratio.

adductor pollicis (thumb) muscle using mechanomyo-
graphy. A force transducer ring is attached to the
thumb, and the fingers are secured to prevent move-
ment during nerve stimulation. Ulnar nerve stimula-
tion (note that the negative electrode is distal to the
positive electrode) will result in the contraction of the
adductor pollicis muscle, and the force of contraction
is measured by the force transducer. The results are
displayed on an interfaced screen.

 used in remote locations away from the anaesthesia
workstations (cardiac catheterisation units, radiology
suites, endoscopy units, etc.), yet be easily integrated
into the workstation and the electronic medical record;
it would display graphically the ST as a percent of
control (T1/TC) and the TOF; it would have the ability
to provide a graphical display of the block onset and
recovery history, so the clinician would be able to
make projections and plan optimal management; and
ideally, be integrated into neuromuscular monitoring
feedback loops that will guide administration of neuro-
muscular blocking agents and optimise the timing of
pharmacologic antagonism.
What are the most common mistakes
clinicians make in monitoring?
(1)
Not using a neuromuscular monitor. As presented
above, subjective evaluation of responses and clin-
ical testing of patients have not decreased the
incidence of postoperative residual weakness. Best
practice is to use objective monitors whenever
possible; if monitors are not available, do not
administer anticholinesterase reversal until spon-
taneous recovery indicates at a minimum a TOF
count of 3, and wait at least 15 min after reversal
before extubating the trachea.
(2)
Use of facial muscles for subjective monitoring.
This practice usually leads to overdosing of neu-
romuscular blocking agents, because the facial
muscles are much more resistant to muscle relax-
ants, and because of the potential for direct mus-
cle stimulation. Best practice is to always establish
a baseline TOF response at the adductor pollicis
muscle (hand) before moving the site of monitor-
ing to the face, if hands are not available intra-
operatively. Before tracheal extubation, always
recheck for adequate reversal at the adductor pol-
licis muscle.
(3)
Using 5-s TET for less than 5 s.: All of the studies
that describe the effects of tetanic stimulation on
subsequent responses have employed a 5-s dura-
tion, so any information obtained following lesser
tetanic durations is likely wrong. Best practice is
always to use the appropriate duration (5 s); teta-
nic stimulation should only be administered to
anaesthetised patients, and it will not harm them.
Conversely, obtaining false information about the
degree of neuromuscular recovery may do so.
(4)
Using subjective evaluation of TOF count. Studies
have documented that subjective evaluation of
TOF count most often overestimates (rather that
underestimates) the degree of recovery, such that

and 2) along the ulnar nerve; and of the recording

Figure 20 Apparatus for objective monitoring of the
adductor pollicis (thumb) muscle contraction using
kinemyography. A mechanosensor (metallic strip) is
placed in the groove between the thumb and index fin-
ger; ulnar nerve stimulation produces adductor pollicis
muscle contraction that bends the strip, generating a
current, which is proportional to the strength of mus-
cle contraction. The results are displayed on the moni-
tor’s screen.

 the dosing and/or the timing of antagonism will
likely be inadequate. Best practice is when phar-
macological reversal with both anticholinesterase
drug (neostigmine) and selective relaxant-binding
agents (sugammadex) is based on the degree of
recovery indicated by TOF count obtained objec-
tively (i.e. measured).
(5)
Determining the onset of neuromuscular block by
ST at 1 Hz. The relatively high frequency of stim-
ulation (one stimulus per second) will increase
the local blood flow and speed delivery of neuro-
muscular blocking agent to the monitored muscle,
falsely indicating a faster onset of block than at
the laryngeal muscles. This may make tracheal
intubation more difficult and increase the poten-
tial for vocal cord injury. Best practice is always
to monitor TOF rather than ST for assessment of
neuromuscular block onset.
(6)
Assessing neuromuscular function < 3 min after
TET. High frequency stimulation (TET) will lead
to a 2–3-min period in which subsequent evoked
responses are potentiated (period of post-tetanic
potentiation). Best practice is only to use TET
when the TOF = 0 and the TOC count = 0, and
wait at least 3 min between TET and a subse-
quent TET, ST or TOF stimulation.
(7)
Not maintaining monitored muscle normothermia.
Particularly when the patient’s arms are away from
the body, the hand may become exposed to the
cold operating room environment. The resultant
hypothermia of the monitored muscle (adductor
pollicis) will significantly affect neuromuscular
transmission and give erroneous information about
the depth of block or degree of recovery. Best prac-
tice is to maintain the peripheral muscle normoth-
ermia with the use of heat warmers.
(8)
Not ensuring good skin contact. Best practice is to
decrease skin resistance by cleaning and degreas-
ing the skin with an abrasive paste before placing
the electrodes, and use fresh wet-gel electrodes to
decrease
the
impedance
at
the
electrode-skin
interface and prevent skin burns.
Conclusions
Drugs that provide neuromuscular blockade and its
reversal
have
enjoyed
widespread
use
among
anaesthesiologists for many decades. Although perhaps
not viewed as an essential tool to administering these
types of drugs, neuromuscular blockade monitoring
should not be difficult to interpret and should always
be used. The intent of this review was to clarify key
elements of neuromuscular monitoring. In conclusion,
the authors encourage consistent use of a neuromuscu-
lar monitoring device any time a neuromuscular block-
ing
drug
is
used,
whether
depolarising
or
non-
depolarising, and recommend the development of edu-
cational activities that make anaesthesia practitioners
aware of important misunderstandings in the manage-
ment of neuromuscular block that directly and fre-
quently impact patient safety.
