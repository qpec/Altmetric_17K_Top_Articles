Abstract
Aims/hypothesis Although the Diabetes Prevention Program
(DPP) established lifestyle changes (diet, exercise and weight
loss) as the ‘gold standard’ preventive therapy for diabetes, the
relative contribution of exercise alone to the overall utility of
the combined diet and exercise effect of DPP is unknown;
furthermore, the optimal intensity of exercise for preventing
progression to diabetes remains very controversial. To estab-
lish clinical efficacy, we undertook a study (2009 to 2013) to
determine: how much of the effect on measures of glucose
homeostasis of a 6 month programme modelled after the first
6 months of the DPP is due to exercise alone; whether
moderate- or vigorous-intensity exercise is better for improv-
ing glucose homeostasis; and to what extent amount of exer-
cise is a contributor to improving glucose control. The primary
outcome was improvement in fasting plasma glucose, with
improvement in plasma glucose AUC response to an OGTT
as the major secondary outcome.
Methods The trial was a parallel clinical trial. Sedentary, non-
smokers who were 45–75 year old adults (n=237) with ele-
vated fasting glucose (5.28–6.94 mmol/l) but without cardio-
vascular disease, uncontrolled hypertension, or diabetes, from
the Durham area, were studied at Duke University. They were
randomised into one of four 6 month interventions: (1) low
amount (42 kJ kg body weight−1 week−1 [KKW])/moderate
intensity: equivalent of expending 42 KKW (e.g. walking
∼16 km [8.6 miles] per week) with moderate-intensity (50%
V
:O2reserve ) exercise; (2) high amount (67 KKW)/moderate
intensity: equivalent of expending 67 KKW (∼22.3 km [13.8
miles] per week) with moderate-intensity exercise; (3) high
amount (67 KKW)/vigorous intensity: equivalent to group 2,
but with vigorous-intensity exercise (75% V
:O2reserve ); and
(4) diet+42 KKW moderate intensity: same as group 1 but
with diet and weight loss (7%) to mimic the first 6 months of
the DPP. Computer-generated randomisation lists were pro-
vided by our statistician (G. P. Samsa). The randomisation list
was maintained by L. H. Willis and C. A. Slentz with no
knowledge of or input into the scheduling, whereas all sched-
uling was done by L. A. Bateman, with no knowledge of the
randomisation list. Subjects were automatically assigned to
the next group listed on the randomisation sheet (with no
ability to manipulate the list order) on the day that they came
in for the OGTT, by L. H. Willis. All plasma analysis was
done blinded by the individuals doing the measurements (i.e.
lipids, glucose, insulin). Subjects and research staff (other than
individuals analysing the blood) were not blinded to the group
assignments.
Results Number randomised, completers and number
analysed with complete OGTT data for each group were:

 moderate-intensity (61, 44, 40); high-amount/vigorous-inten-
sity (61, 43, 38); diet/exercise (54, 45, 37), respectively. Only
the diet and exercise group experienced a decrease in fasting
glucose (p<0.001). The means and 95% CIs for changes in
fasting glucose (mmol/l) for each group were: high-amount/
moderate-intensity −0.07 (−0.20, 0.06); high-amount/vigor-
ous 0.06 (−0.07, 0.19); low-amount/moderate 0.05 (−0.05,
0.15); and diet/exercise −0.32 (−0.46, −0.18). The effects
sizes for each group (in the same order) were: 0.17, 0.15,
0.18 and 0.71, respecively. For glucose tolerance (glucose
AUC of OGTT), similar improvements were observed for
the diet and exercise (8.2% improvement, effect size 0.73)
and the 67 KKW moderate-intensity exercise (6.4% improve-
ment, effect size 0.60) groups; moderate-intensity exercise was
significantly more effective than the same amount of vigorous-
intensity exercise (p < 0.0207). The equivalent amount of
vigorous-intensity exercise alone did not significantly improve
glucose tolerance (1.2% improvement, effect size 0.21).
Changes in insulin AUC, fasting plasma glucose and insulin
did not differ among the exercise groups and were numerically
inferior to the diet and exercise group.
Conclusions/interpretation In the present clinical efficacy trial
we found that a high amount of moderate-intensity exercise
alone was very effective at improving oral glucose tolerance
despite a relatively modest 2 kg change in body fat mass.
These data, combined with numerous published observations
of the strong independent relation between postprandial glucose
concentrations and prediction of future diabetes, suggest that
walking ∼18.2 km (22.3 km prescribed with 81.6% adherence
in the 67 KKW moderate-intensity group) per week may be
nearly as effective as a more intensive multicomponent approach
involving diet, exercise and weight loss for preventing the pro-
gression to diabetes in prediabetic individuals. These findings
have important implications for the choice of clinical intervention
to prevent progression to type 2 diabetes for those at high risk.

Studies of Targeted Risk Reduction
Interventions through Defined Exercise [in in-

Introduction
Type 2 diabetes is one of the leading health threats in the
developed world. The landmark Diabetes Prevention
Program (DPP) established lifestyle changes (diet, exercise
and weight loss) to be the ‘gold standard’ therapy for preven-
tion of diabetes [1]. However, efficient and effective imple-
mentation of lifestyle interventions to prevent diabetes re-
quires the following issues to be established: the relative con-
tribution of exercise alone to the overall diet and exercise
effect of DPP; whether moderate- or vigorous-intensity exer-
cise is better for improving glucose homeostasis; and whether
the amount of exercise is an important variable for improving
glucose control. Resolution of these issues is important for
implementation of the optimal lifestyle programme for pre-
vention of diabetes. If providers in busy clinical practices find
it necessary and effective to counsel only one component of a
lifestyle intervention at a time and/or patients are more likely
to undertake a single lifestyle change at a time (e.g. an
exercise-only programme), it is critical to understand how
much of the beneficial effects of the diet and exercise pro-
gramme they are likely to expect.
The most efficacious exercise intensity for control of glu-
cose metabolism remains controversial. Many studies suggest
that moderate-intensity exercise may be more beneficial than
vigorous-intensity exercise for some outcomes [2–13]. In
STRRIDE (Studies of Targeted Risk Reduction
Interventions through Defined Exercise), we observed that
moderate-intensity training was more effective at improving
insulin sensitivity [2, 3], the metabolic syndrome [6], triacyl-
glycerols [4, 13] and beta cell function [5] than an energy
equivalent amount of vigorous-intensity exercise training. In
contrast, one recent study [14] implies that vigorous-intensity
exercise is superior to moderate-intensity exercise for glucose
control. Few studies have tested head to head the effects of
exercise intensity for glucose homeostasis while simulta-
neously controlling for total exercise energy expenditure or
the effect of exercise amount while controlling for intensity.
To better understand the exercise benefit relative to a com-
bined exercise/diet programme, and to explore the indepen-
dent influence of exercise intensity and amount for improve-
ment in glucose homeostasis in those at risk for diabetes, we
undertook STRRIDE-PD (STRRIDE in individuals with
Prediabetes; i.e., in individuals at risk for progression to dia-
betes with fasting plasma glucose of 5.3 to 6.9 mmol/l on two
consecutive occasions, separated by at least 1 week), a clinical
efficacy trial. The study goals meant that the study design
incorporated qualitative comparisons with a diet and exercise
programme modelled after the first 6 months of the DPP (rath-
er than with a non-exercising control group). To investigate
the role of intensity and amount, direct statistical comparisons
were made among the exercise-only groups. Based on our
previous observations—and perhaps contrary to ‘common
Diabetologia (2016) 59:2088–2098
2089
 wisdom’—we hypothesised that: a high percentage of the diet
and exercise effect on measures of glucose control would be
achieved with a high amount of moderate-intensity exercise;
moderate-intensity exercise would be superior to vigorous-
intensity exercise training, controlling for amount; and a high
amount would be superior to a low amount of moderate-
intensity exercise.
We are not aware of any other studies that have studied the
effects of different intensities of exercise training controlling
for total energy expenditure on oral glucose tolerance in indi-
viduals with prediabetes.
Methods
Study design
The protocol was approved by the Duke Institutional Review
Board and informed written consent obtained. Participants
were recruited continuously between 2009 and 2012 from
Durham (NC, USA) and the surrounding area. We randomised
237 sedentary 45–75 year old adults with BMI 25–35 kg/m2.
A statistician (G. P. Samsa) provided four computer-generated
randomisation lists by sex/race (white women, white men,
non-white women, non-white men) in blocks of 12. The
randomisation lists were maintained by L. H. Willis and
C. A. Slentz with no knowledge of, and no input into, sched-
uling, whereas all scheduling was done by L. A. Bateman with
no knowledge of the randomisation list. Participants were au-
tomatically assigned to the next group on the randomisation
list (with no ability to manipulate the list order) on the day that
they came in for their glucose tolerance test by L. H. Willis.
Recruited individuals had two consecutive fasting glucoses
between 5.28 and 6.94 mmol/l taken 1 week apart.
Exclusion criteria included smoking, diabetes, uncontrolled
hypertension, musculoskeletal disorders and cardiovascular
disease. The study design was listed on clinicaltrials.gov (reg-
istration number NCT00962962) prior to initiation of the study.
Interventions
Participants were randomised into one of four 6 month inter-
vention groups consisting of exercise predominantly on tread-
mills, but also elliptical trainers, rowing and cycle ergometers:
(1) low amount/moderate-intensity exercise (42 kJ kg body
weight−1 week−1 [KKW]), exercise energy expenditure of 42
KKW at 50% V
:O2reserve; (2) high amount/moderate-intensity
exercise (67 KKW), 67 KKW at 50% V
:O2reserve; (3) high
amount/vigorous-intensity exercise (67 KKW), 67 KKW at
75% V
:
O2reserve; and (4) clinical lifestyle intervention (diet+
exercise): 42 KKW at 50% V
:O2reserve plus a diet designed to
reduce body weight by 7% over 7 months.
V
:
O2peak was determined by a graded maximal treadmill test
which started at 3 mph/0% grade and then increased speed
and/or grade such that the metabolic demand increased at
approximately 3.5 ml kg−1 min−1 per stage. V
:
O2reserve (50%
or 75%) was chosen for the exercise prescription and defined
as 0.50 or 0.75 × (V
:O2peak – resting V
:O2 ) + resting V
:O2.
Energy (kJ) expended during exercise per week was deter-
mined based on the per cent of V
:
O2reserve only, without includ-
ing the resting V
:
O2. This is the most accurate way to compare
groups exercising at differing intensities [15]. The heart rate at
any given intensity was determined by a progressive exercise
test with gas exchange. Exercise frequency was up to the
participant; a frequency was recommended with the goal of
a 60 min maximum for a single session. Participants were
asked to exercise under supervision on at least 2 days per
week; at these sessions, we downloaded their heart rate mon-
itors and discussed training progress. Participants were
allowed to exercise at our fitness centre without supervision
on the other days.
A 10 week ramp period gradually increased exercise
amount to the prescribed level. Exercise intensity was main-
tained by using a target heart rate range confirmed by a sub-
maximal oxygen consumption testing at the midpoint of the
exercise programme. Thus, as fitness increased, participants
worked harder to achieve a similar heart rate, which required
reducing weekly exercise time to maintain constant weekly
energy expenditure. All exercise was verified by Garmin
(Olathe, KS, USA) downloadable heart rate monitors.
Maximal exercise duration was capped at 6 h/week to limit
participant burden—women have lower V
:
O2peak so had to
exercise longer to expend the same total energy per week,
and we believed this would have placed a disproportionate
time burden on women and reduced compliance. Similarly,
participants with low exercise capacity had to exercise for a
longer time to achieve the desired weekly energy expenditure.
Participants randomised to the diet and exercise group re-
ceived an intervention modelled after the DPP [1], designed to
achieve a 7% weight reduction via energy-intake restriction,
low-fat diet and exercise. Following four initial counselling
sessions, participants attended 12 bi-weekly intensive group
sessions adapted from the DPP manual.
Body composition Body composition was determined using
air displacement plethysmography (BOD POD Life
Measurement, Concord, CA, USA).
OGTT and lipids Before training and between 16 and 24 h
after the last exercise training bout, after a 10 h fast, partici-
pants drank a 75 g glucose drink with blood samples taken at
0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min. Participants were asked to eat their
normal diet the evening before each test. Glucose, total cho-
lesterol, HDL-cholesterol and triacylglycerol were measured
2090

 with a Beckman-Coulter DxC600 clinical analyser (Brea, CA,
USA). Insulin was measured by electrochemiluminescent
plate assay, Meso Scale Discovery (Gaithersburg, MD,
USA). AUCs of the glucose and insulin curves were calculat-
ed by the trapezoid method. Matsuda index was calculated as
described in Matsuda and Defronzo [16].
Outcomes The primary outcome for this trial was fasting glu-
cose. Other strong secondary outcomes included other mea-
sures of glucose control: specifically, changes in glucose
tolerance (AUCs for glucose, and 1 h and 2 h glucose values),
fasting insulin and insulin AUC. Additional outcomes includ-
ed measures of cardiometabolic health (lipids, waist circum-
ference, cardiorespiratory fitness, body weight and body
composition).
Sample size Based on our experience from STRRIDE [2, 3],
we estimated we would need 35–45 finishers per group to
have adequate power to detect significant changes within
groups for cardiometabolic variables and that this sample size
would provide enough power to detect differences between
groups. While neither we nor others have specific data on
the improvement in glucose tolerance expected for different
exercise intensities, the study by Houmard et al [3] had ade-
quate power to detect a difference in insulin sensitivity
between the low amount/moderate intensity and the low
amount/vigorous intensity groups (p<0.05), which strongly
supported an intensity effect (i.e. moderate intensity was
superior). While we hoped to finish with 50 participants in
each group, funding cuts meant we had to stop just short of
that goal (within 10%).
Statistical analyses A priori, the study was designed to make
only qualitative comparisons (per cent comparisons, non-
statistical) among the three exercise-only groups when com-
pared with the diet, exercise and intentional weight loss group;
therefore, there was no inactive control group in this study. To
address the question of how the exercise-only interventions
compared with the lifestyle intervention, percentages of the
effect observed with each of exercise-only intervention rela-
tive to that obtained with the diet-exercise group is reported.
This is justified based on the findings of DPP, in which the
lifestyle intervention was superior to metformin and control
[1]; therefore, it was not clinically useful to compare the
effects of our interventions with a control.
The primary quantitative comparisons were assessing the
independent effects of exercise intensity and amount on out-
comes. The study was powered for two statistical compari-
sons: (1) an exercise-intensity effect was tested by comparing
the two 67 KKW groups (high amount/moderate vs high-
amount/vigorous); and (2) an exercise amount effect was test-
ed by comparing the two moderate-intensity groups. Group
comparisons were performed with ANCOVA and included
baseline values as covariates (Statview, Cary, NC, USA).
Post hoc analyses were confined to the two comparisons
among the exercise groups (of intensity and amount): the crit-
ical α was p<0.025 to account for two major comparisons. To
determine whether within-group changes (i.e. not between
groups) were significant, we used two-tailed paired (pre-inter-
vention vs post-intervention) t tests, where critical α was
p < 0.05. The analyses presented were performed ‘per
protocol’.
Results
Figure 1 shows the flow diagram of screening, randomisation
and dropout numbers. Demographic baseline characteristics
and exercise prescriptions are presented in Table 1. Baseline
values and change scores for body composition and metabolic
variables are shown in Table 2. The two high-amount groups
were significantly older than the low-amount and diet/exercise
groups. There were no other baseline differences between
groups for variables in Tables 1 or 2. Participants who dropped
out were heavier (92.2 vs 87.2 kg), had greater fat mass (38.0
vs 35.5 kg) and larger waist circumferences (102.8 vs
99.2 cm) compared with the completers at baseline (all
p<0.05, data not shown). No other differences between com-
pleters and dropouts were observed for variables presented in
Tables 1 and 2. There were no differences for any metabolic
outcome variable at baseline between intervention groups or
between completers and dropouts.
Exercise prescriptions are in Table 1. The time required to
expend 67 KKW is based on fitness levels (oxygen consump-
tion rate; ml kg−1 min−1; 1 l O2 consumption is roughly equiv-
alent to 21 kJ energy use) and exercise training intensity (mod-
erate or vigorous). Individuals with lower maximal fitness
levels required more time to complete the energy-
expenditure-based exercise prescriptions at either 50% or
75% of this value. While energetically equivalent, moderate-
intensity exercise appears to improve some key metabolic
variables more than vigorous-intensity, vigorous-intensity ex-
ercise improved fitness levels to a greater degree.
Table 2 presents baseline and change scores for key vari-
ables. As expected, all groups lost weight (though the weight
lost by the low amount/moderate intensity group was not sig-
nificant). Also, when expressed in ml kg−1 min−1, the
diet/exercise group and both high-amount exercise groups ex-
perienced significant improvements in cardiorespiratory fit-
ness. Importantly, this increase in fitness was due entirely to
weight loss for the diet/exercise group, because when
expressed as l/min there was no increase for this group.
Changes in body composition were greatest for the
diet/exercise group; and for the exercise-only groups,
corresponded to total exercise energy expenditure.

 Magnitude of exercise contribution Only the diet/exercise
group experienced significant reductions in fasting glucose
(Table 2). Diet/exercise also had the most robust effects on
fasting insulin, HOMA, Matsuda index and insulin AUC. As
indicated by changes in insulin AUC and Matsuda index score,
all interventions improved insulin sensitivity. For improving
glucose tolerance, the low amount/moderate intensity group
was half as effective as diet/exercise (53%) and twice as effec-
tive as the high amount/vigorous intensity group.
Intensity effects For both the diet/exercise and the high
amount/moderate intensity group, changes in glucose AUC
were similar and quite robust (Fig. 2a). The high amount/
moderate-intensity exercise group achieved 79% of the im-
provement in glucose tolerance of the diet/exercise group
(t test for within-group change for high/moderate group,
p=0.0005; Table 2). The glucose incremental AUC data show
that the main difference between lifestyle and high amount/
moderate was due to the decrease in fasting glucose by the
lifestyle group. The AUC incremental improvement was
actually higher for the high/moderate group.
In contrast, the high amount/vigorous intensity group
experienced a very small, non-significant, change in glucose
AUC (t test, p=0.20). Importantly, the high amount/moderate
intensity group was statistically superior to the high amount/
vigorous group (p=0.0207; effect size=0.445; Fig. 2a). The
low amount/moderate intensity group was intermediate
between the high-amount exercise groups; however, the
improvement was not quite significant (p<0.10).
Amount effects The high amount/moderate intensity group
experienced larger quantitative improvements than the low
amount/moderate-intensity exercise group for most, but not
all, of the glucose homeostasis variables (Fig. 2a–d, Table 2),
although there were no statistically significant differences be-
tween the two moderate-intensity groups. The effects of the
different interventions on the glucose and insulin curves are
shown in Fig. 3a–d (glucose) and Fig. 4a–d (insulin). Glucose
values at 30, 60 and 90 but not 120 min were significantly
improved after exercise training in the high amount/moderate
intensity group, whereas the reverse occurred in the high
amount/vigorous intensity group (Fig. 3a). When a separate
ANCOVA was performed between the high amount/moderate
vs high amount/vigorous groups on each time point (30, 60, 90
and 120 min) the p values for statistical comparisons at these
four time points were: 0.035; 0.086, 0.081 and 0.597,

 respectively. The high amount of moderate-intensity exercise
resulted in significant improvements in glucose at 30 min.
Though the high amount/vigorous group experienced a signif-
icant improvement in glucose at 120 min, this improvement
was not different from the improvement in the high amount/
moderate intensity group. As was expected, the largest and
most consistently significant improvement was observed in
the clinical lifestyle group. As illustrated in Fig. 4a–d, all four
interventions resulted in robust reductions in overall insulin
levels and in reductions in insulin at all time points.
Discussion
There were two major goals for our study: (1) to determine, in
individuals at risk for diabetes, what percentage of the ‘gold
standard’ effect of diet and exercise can be achieved with
aerobic exercise alone on glucose homeostasis measures
(fasting glucose, oral glucose tolerance and measures of insu-
lin sensitivity); and (2) to determine the independent effects of
exercise intensity and amount on these same measures in in-
dividuals at risk of developing diabetes. We are not aware of
any other studies that have investigated the effects of different
intensities of exercise training on oral glucose tolerance in
individuals with prediabetes. For the primary outcome, fasting
glucose, there was significant improvement only in the diet
and exercise group. The exercise-only groups did not experi-
ence any change in fasting glucose. With respect to glucose
tolerance, there were two major findings. First, the effect of a
high amount/moderate-intensity exercise on glucose tolerance
was essentially the same as that for the diet/exercise group;
this exercise-only group achieved 79% of the improvement in

Prescribed exercise amounts (42 and 67 KKW) are approximately equivalent to 8.6 and 13.8 miles of walking/jogging per week
Amount completed = exercise amount × adherence
Actual time (min/week) = exercise time × adherence
As exercise prescription is made equivalent per unit of body mass, the only factors that determines the amount of time required to expend the appropriate
number of kJ is fitness (V
:O2peak ) and number of KKW (i.e. in this study, either 42 or 67 KKW); this explains why women, who have on average lower
fitness levels when expressed per kg body weight, have a higher number of prescribed min for any given exercise prescription, when compared with men

 glucose tolerance that was obtained with the combined thera-
py group. Second, high amount/moderate-intensity exercise
robustly improved glucose homeostasis and had a statistically
superior effect on AUC for glucose during an OGTT com-
pared with the same amount of vigorous-intensity exercise.
These observations are remarkable. They confirm and
build on our earlier findings regarding exercise training inten-
sity effects. In STRRIDE [17], a large randomised controlled
trial, we observed that, compared with vigorous-intensity ex-
ercise, the same amount of moderate-intensity exercise train-
ing led to greater improvements in: insulin sensitivity [2, 3],
the metabolic syndrome [6], triacylglycerols [13] and beta cell
function [5]. That is, while we [18] and others have observed
that vigorous intensity is clearly superior for improvements in
cardiorespiratory fitness, our previous findings, taken together
with the current study, suggest that moderate-intensity exer-
cise may be better than vigorous-intensity exercise for main-
taining cardiometabolic health and preventing the develop-
ment of diabetes in at-risk individuals.
Recently, in a large and well-designed exercise study
[14], Ross and colleagues reached an opposing conclusion
that vigorous-intensity exercise outperformed moderate-
intensity exercise in measures of glucose control; however,
most of their observations were remarkably similar to those
made in our study. In the study by Ross et al, 300 abdomi-
nally obese individuals unscreened for baseline glucose
abnormalities were randomised to high amount/vigorous
intensity, high amount/moderate intensity, low amount/
moderate intensity or control group; this was very similar
to our study design. In the study by Ross et al, changes in
waist circumference and the 2 h glucose time point during
the OGTT were considered primary outcomes. The vigo-
rous intensity/high amount group outperformed the con-
trols at the 120 min OGTT glucose time point. The effect
for the moderate intensity/high amount group was non-
significant at this time point; however, direct comparison
of intensity effects controlling for amount in Ross’s Table 3
reveals that the effects of the high amount/vigorous and

 high amount/moderate exercise on 2 h glucose were not
different. Inspection of our Fig. 3c and Table 2 also reveal
that, of the exercise-only interventions, only with vigorous-
intensity exercise did we observe a significant change in 2 h
glucose. One should note that in the study by Ross et al,
both high-amount groups improved several health-related
measures compared with controls: insulin AUC, Matsuda
index, HDL-cholesterol, fasting insulin, HOMA, and sys-
tolic and diastolic blood pressure (Appendix and Table 3
from the Ross paper). However, in Ross’s study, only the
high amount/moderate-intensity exercise (and not vigorous
intensity) was significantly different from the control group
for these measures. Thus, despite some differences in the
study population and approach, our findings—if not our
conclusions—are remarkably concordant with those in the
Ross study. The exception is a substantial difference with
our findings of a significant difference between the two
high-amount groups on improvement in AUC for glucose.
This may be due to the different participant populations. In
the present study, participants were recruited specifically to
select for abnormal glucose; in the Ross study, participants
were selected for abdominal obesity. In summary the
outcome of the dispute may depend on which variable is
chosen as the primary outcome measure.
We conclude that the large improvement in post-load glu-
cose observed with high amount/moderate-intensity exercise
suggests this may be a very effective intervention for reducing
the risk of diabetes. Several studies have observed that post-
load glucose is superior to fasting glucose for predicting all-
cause mortality, cardiovascular disease incidence and mortal-
ity, and incident diabetes [19–32]. In the San Antonio Heart
Study [32] and the Botnia Study [29], 1 h glucose was the best
single predictor of incident diabetes, significantly better than
both fasting and 2 h glucose [30, 29]; this is particularly rele-
vant, as moderate-intensity exercise appears especially effec-
tive at lowering 1 h glucose (Fig. 3a).
The diet/exercise group experienced a robust reduction in
fasting glucose, while the exercise-only groups had no effect
on fasting glucose; this was an expected finding. It is intrigu-
ing to speculate about the mechanisms mediating this effect.
Impaired fasting glucose is generally considered to be indica-
tive of hepatic insulin resistance, whereas impaired glucose
tolerance is considered to be reflective of peripheral insulin
resistance [33]. While we did not statistically compare the diet

Awith baseline values as a covar-
iate, with post hoc testing between the two groups differing in exercise
intensity and between the two groups differing in amount (controlling for
baseline values) revealed a statistically significant difference (*p < 0.05
[p = 0.0207]) between the high amount/moderate intensity and the high
amount/vigorous intensity groups for glucose AUC. The improvement in
the high amount/moderate intensity group was superior to, but not statis-
tically different from, the low amount group. Mod, moderate; vig,

 and exercise group with the exercise-only groups, the diet and
exercise group experienced between 188% and 269% greater
improvement in the Matsuda index (Table 2) than the
exercise-only groups. The Matsuda index includes all glucose
and insulin values obtained from the 2 h glucose test; thus, the
robust improvements seen in these individual variables by the
diet/exercise group was reflected in the Matsuda index.
We were surprised to observe that vigorous-intensity exer-
cise training had no significant effect on glucose AUC when
measured 16–24 h after the last exercise training bout. While
this group experienced reductions in insulin AUC, it will be
important to understand (through future mechanistic studies)
why vigorous-intensity training did not improve glucose tol-
erance. Perhaps vigorous-intensity exercise—but not
moderate-intensity exercise—results in increases in glucose
counter-regulatory hormones or skeletal muscle adaptations
to acute exercise that prevent the maximum benefit of training
to be accrued between 16 and 24 h after the last bout of
exercise.
It is important to note the limitations of this study.
Obtaining a high amount of moderate-intensity exercise in
individuals with low fitness is challenging. Participants in

 our study required, on average, 4.8 h of moderate-intensity
exercise (more for women) to expend 67 KKW. Importantly,
the diet part of the diet/exercise weight loss group was much
more intensive and included many additional one-on-one and
small-group interactions; this resulted in the lowest dropout
rate of all of the groups. We did not control for the greater
amount of personal contact time received by the diet/exercise
relative to the exercise-only groups. Finally, we can only infer
the effects of the different interventions on true diabetes inci-
dence and progression. In reality, only a diabetes outcome
study would be able to determine whether moderate-
intensity exercise is superior to vigorous-intensity exercise in
the prevention of type 2 diabetes, and whether it is similar to
diet/exercise in effectiveness.
In summary, a high amount of moderate-intensity exercise
achieved 79% of the glucose-lowering effect that was experi-
enced by an intensive combined lifestyle intervention
consisting of diet and exercise designed to effect a 7% weight
loss over 6 months. In addition, moderate-intensity exercise
was significantly superior to the energy-equivalent amount of
vigorous-intensity exercise for improvements in glucose tol-
erance. Taken together with the numerous findings of strong
independent relations between postprandial glucose levels and
prediction of type 2 diabetes, these observations suggest that a
high amount of moderate-intensity exercise may be a very
effective intervention for preventing progression to diabetes
in at-risk individuals. However, other than the significant dif-
ference in glucose tolerance, there were no other significant
differences between the moderate- and vigorous-intensity ex-
ercise training groups for any other cardiometabolic health-
related variable.
