 During the past century, dramatic modifications in life­
style have radically changed the health priorities in most 
areas of the world, owing to a growing incidence of non­
communicable disease. The new epidemic in chronic liver 
disease is related to the burden of NAFLD, parallel 
ing 
the worldwide increase of obesity. The global prevalence 
of NAFLD is currently estimated to be 24%1. Commu­
nity surveys utilizing ultrasonography or proton NMR 
 
spec 
tro 
scopy have assessed the prevalence of NAFLD 
across geographical locales (FIG. 1), whereas studies 
based on elevated liver enzymes systematically under­
estim 
ated the true prevalence1. NAFLD is highly preva­
lent in all continents, but the highest rates are reported 
from South America (31%) and the Middle East (32%), 
 
followed by Asia (27%), the USA (24%) and Europe 
(23%), whereas NAFLD is less common in Africa (14%)1.
NAFLD, particularly its histological phenotype 
NASH, can potentially progress to advanced liver dis­
ease, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)2. 
The prevalence of NAFLD is constantly increasing 
(15% in 2005 to 25% in 2010) and similarly the rate of 
NASH in the same timeframe has almost doubled (59.1% 
versus 33%)1. NASH is now considered the  
second 
most  
common indication for liver transplantation in 
the USA after chronic hepatitis C, and is still growing2. 
This Review will provide evidence of the global burden 
of NAFLD and its clinical and economic implications, 
which should be considered by health policies to secure 
a better future for coming generations.
NAFLD in the USA and South America
Prevalence of NAFLD in the USA. Over the past two 
decades, there has been extensive research to accurately 
determine the prevalence of NAFLD in the USA3–10. 
These data were summarized in a meta­analysis pub­
lished in 2016 reporting the worldwide prevalence 
of NAFLD1. In most of these studies, the prevalence of 
NAFLD in the general population was determined by 
imaging or other indirect methods. In this context, the 
prevalence of NAFLD in the USA diagnosed by ultra­
sonography was estimated to be 24.13% (95% CI 19.73–
29.15%). On the other hand, the prevalence of NAFLD as 
determined by any other noninvasive methods (such 
as the Fatty Liver Index, International Classification of 
Diseases (ICD) 9 or ICD 10 coding) was reported to be 
~21.09% (95% CI 15.0–28.8%), suggesting that diagnosis 
of NAFLD solely based on blood testing or ICD coding 
can lead to under­reporting of its true prevalence1.
In the USA, the prevalence of NAFLD can vary by 
the ethnicity. In this context, the prevalence of NAFLD 
is reported to be highest in Hispanic Americans, fol­
lowed by Americans of European descent and then 
African Americans3–11. Although still not fully resolved, 
a number of factors could explain these reported 
 
ethnic disparities in the prevalence of NAFLD in the 
USA, including genetic factors, environmental  
factors, 
access to health care and presence of chronic diseases 
such as the meta 
bolic syndrome1,6–8. The lower preva­
lence of NAFLD among African Americans than

Abstract | NAFLD is one of the most important causes of liver disease worldwide and will probably 
emerge as the leading cause of end-stage liver disease in the coming decades, with the disease 
affecting both adults and children. The epidemiology and demographic characteristics of NAFLD 
vary worldwide, usually parallel to the prevalence of obesity, but a substantial proportion of 
patients are lean. The large number of patients with NAFLD with potential for progressive liver 
disease creates challenges for screening, as the diagnosis of NASH necessitates invasive liver 
biopsy. Furthermore, individuals with NAFLD have a high frequency of metabolic comorbidities 
and could place a growing strain on health-care systems from their need for management. 
While awaiting the development effective therapies, this disease warrants the attention 
of primary care physicians, specialists and health policy makers.

 Hispanic Americans5,8 is especially surprising because 
of the higher preva 
lence of obesity and hypertension in 
 
African American patients5,8.
By contrast, a study using data from the US Third 
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 
(1988–1994) reported that the metabolic syndrome was 
the primary driver of NAFLD among non­ 
Hispanic 
black patients and Mexican Americans, but not for white 
Americans. Despite some contradictory data regarding 
the interaction of NAFLD and components of the meta­
bolic syndrome in African Americans, this study suggests 
that the association of the metabolic syndrome with 
NAFLD might be influenced by ethnicity12.
In another study using data from the Nonalcoholic 
Steatohepatitis Clinical Research Network (NASH CRN), 
investigators compared Latino patients with NASH with 
non­Latino white patients with NASH13. The study found 
that Latino patients with NASH were younger (mean 
44.2 years of age versus 50.9 years of age), undertook less 
physical activity, but had a higher carbohydrate intake 
than non­Latino white patients. Furthermore, they 
reported that the effect of insulin resistance as defined 
by the homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) on the 
risk of NASH was modified by ethnicity. In this context, 
HOMA was not a risk factor for NASH among Latino 
patients (odds ratio (OR) 0.93, 95% CI 0.85–1.02), but 
was an important risk factor among non­Latino white 
patients with NASH (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.01–1.11). These 
data confirm that factors associated with NAFLD can be 
influenced by the ethnic background of the patient13.
It is also important to recognize that even within 
 
certain ethnic groups in the USA there might be differ­
ences in the prevalence of NAFLD. In fact, the prevalence 
of NAFLD among Hispanic Americans can vary accord­
ing to the country of origin8,14,15. In one study, investi­
gators compared the prevalence of NAFLD in Hispanic 
individuals of Mexican origin and Hispanic individuals 
of Dominican and Puerto Rican origins (Caribbean 
area). Using data from the Multi­Ethnic Study of 
Atherosclerosis (MESA) cohort, the overall prevalence 
of NAFLD in Hispanic people was 29%14. However, 
Hispanic individuals of Mexican origin had a higher 
prevalence of NAFLD, at 33%, whereas Hispanic individ­
uals of Dominican origin had a prevalence of only 16% 
and Hispanic individuals of Puerto Rican  
origin had a 
prevalence of 18%. After multivariate analysis controlling 
for age, sex, BMI, waist circumference, hypertension, 
level of education, HOMA and serum HDL, triglycer­
ide and C­reactive protein levels, Hispanic individ 
uals 
of Mexican origin continued to remain at higher risk of 
 
having NAFLD than individuals of Dominican and 
Puerto Rican origin14.
Although the ethnic and country of origin data 
regarding the prevalence of NAFLD is interesting, the 
exact explanation for these ethnic differences remains 
unknown. Some of these differences can be explained by 
the genetic factors that are described later in this Review 
(nature), whereas others can be explained by environ­
mental factors (nurture), such as diet, exercise and alco­
hol consumption. Finally, the prevalence of NASH in 
the general population remains unknown. Nevertheless, 
there are indirect estimates for these rates, derived by 
calcu 
lating prevalence of NASH in NAFLD and preva­
lence of NAFLD in the general population. In this 
context, the prevalence of NASH among patients with 
NAFLD in the USA is reported to be 21% (95% CI 19.85–
22.95%)1. Using this rate, prevalence of NASH in the US 
population is estimated to be around 3–4%1. The corres­
ponding prevalence of comorbid conditions associ 
ated 
with NASH in these individuals has been reported to be: 
obesity in 82%; type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in 48%; 
hyperlipidaemia in 82%; the metabolic syndrome in 76%; 
and hypertension in 70%1.
Prevalence of NAFLD in South America. The preva­
lence of NAFLD in South America seems to be higher 
than the rate reported for the USA. Specifically, NAFLD 
prevalence (assessed by ultrasonography) for South 
America has been estimated to be ~30.45% (95% CI 
22.74–39.4%)1. The majority of studies reporting the 
preva 
lence of NAFLD from South America have been 
performed in Brazil15–17. Nevertheless, in a study reported 
from Chile, the prevalence of NAFLD (diagnosed using 
Key points
• As a consequence of the pandemic spread of obesity, NAFLD is one of the most 
important causes of liver disease worldwide in adults and children, although some 
patients are lean
• Global prevalence of NAFLD is estimated at 24%; the highest rates are reported from 
South America and the Middle East, followed by Asia, the USA and Europe
• The large volume of patients sets NAFLD apart from other liver disease, meaning the 
major focus of clinical care is discerning those at highest risk of progressive liver disease
• Being overweight in childhood and adolescence is associated with increased risk of 
NAFLD later in life; consequently, the threshold of liver-related morbidity and/or 
mortality is reached at a younger age
• Patients with NAFLD have a high risk of liver-related morbidity and mortality along 
with metabolic comorbidities and might place a growing strain on health-care systems
• While awaiting effective therapies, NAFLD warrants the attention of primary-care 
physicians, specialists and health policy makers, starting with prevention of excessive 
weight gain during childhood

 ultrasonography) was estimated to be 23%18. Another 
study from Columbia, also using ultrasonography, 
reported a prevalence of 26.6% in men19. Furthermore, 
the same investigators have estimated that the prevalence 
of ‘probable NAFLD’
, inferred from the rates of obesity, in 
Peru, Argentina, Ecuador, Paraguay, and Uruguay, could 
be as low as 13% (Peru) to as high as 24% (Uruguay)19. 
Although there are estimates for the prevalence of 
NAFLD in South America, the data on the prevalence 
of NASH is even more scarce. Nevertheless, in one study, 
61% of the morbidly obese patients with NAFLD in South 
America were found to have NASH, which could make 
the prevalence of NASH 6–18%20. Again, these rates can 
be influenced by genetic predisposition, as described later.
In summary, NAFLD prevalence rates differ by 
 
ethnicity within the USA1,18–21. The Hispanic population 
has the highest prevalence whereas African Americans 
are reported to have the lowest prevalence, despite hav­
ing higher prevalence of hypertension and obesity, both 
NAFLD risk factors. Ethnic differences are also noted 
within South America, with Brazil reporting the highest 
NAFLD prevalence and Peru the lowest.
Incidence of NAFLD and future projections in the USA 
and South America. Longitudinal studies of the gen­
eral population are lacking in both the USA and South 
America. As a result, there are no true population­ 
based 
incidence data reported for NAFLD. However, Kanwal 
and colleagues10 have suggested that the annual incidence 
of NAFLD based on liver enzyme levels in veterans from 
the USA who were younger than 45 years old increased 
from 2.32% to 4.26% (P <0.001). Furthermore, NAFLD 
is known to be highly associated with several meta­
bolic conditions (T2DM, obesity, the metabolic syn­
drome, hypertension and hyperlipid 
aemia)22,23. Thus, 
it is expected that the incidence of NAFLD should rise 
in paral 
lel to the increasing incidence of obesity and 
T2DM24. In addition to obtaining data about the true 
incidence of NAFLD, it is also important to determine 
the long­term outcomes of patients with NAFLD. In this 
context, develop 
ing algorithms to define which patients 
with NAFLD will develop the progressive form of NASH, 
cirrho 
sis, liver­related mortality or cardiovascular 
 
mortality will be of great importance.
NAFLD in Europe
Epidemiology of NAFLD in Europe. In Europe, a gradi­
ent of increasing prevalence from north to south has 
been described for most forms of chronic viral or non­ 
viral hepatitis, but this observation does not hold true 
for NAFLD. Rather, the globalization of NAFLD runs 
parallel to the prevalence of obesity and varies accord­
ingly, with degree of hepatic triglyceride accumulation 
being directly proportional to the severity of each ele­
ment of the metabolic syndrome25. Although prevalence 
varies according to the modality used to detect NAFLD, 
approximately one­quarter of the European population 
is affected by this liver disease. A meta­analysis published 
in 2016 reported an average prevalence of 23.71% in 
Europe, varying from 5% to 44% in different countries1.

 Data from the Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP) 
cohort in northeastern Germany estimates the preva­
lence of NAFLD to be ~30% when diagnosed by 
ultra 
sonography26. A UK­based community study deter­
mined that NAFLD was the most common aetiology for 
asymptomatic abnormal liver biochemistry, accounting 
for 26.4% of cases (of whom 7.6% were predicted to have 
advanced liver disease)27. Similarly, a series of liver biop­
sies in individuals with unexplained abnormal liver tests 
conducted in France reported simple steatosis in 26.8% 
of patients, of whom 32.7% had NASH28. In the Dionysos 
Study, the prevalence of NAFLD assessed by ultra­
sonography in northern Italy was similar in those with 
and without suspected liver disease (25% versus 20%, 
P = 0.203), defined as altered circulating liver enzyme 
levels or hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and/or 
anti­HCV positivity29. Notably, only 54% of NAFLD 
cases occurred in patients with elevated serum alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) levels, but the vast majority of 
these individuals had many features of the metabolic 
syndrome. Epidemiological data from Spain describe 
similar rates, with a NAFLD prevalence of 25.8% in 
the adult population30. Only a few studies are available 
from eastern Europe. In Romania, NAFLD (assessed 
by ultrasonography) was found in 20% of 3,005 hospi­
talized patients without liver disease31, whereas a study 
on healthy Hungarian adults confirmed a 22.6% overall 
prevalence of ultrasonographically detected fatty liver32.
As expected, the prevalence of NAFLD increases 
substantially in ‘at risk’ groups such as patients with 
T2DM2. The two major available studies, conducted on 
a large cohort of Italian patients with T2DM, reported 
NAFLD prevalence of 60–70%33,34; data from the UK 
suggests that NAFLD, detected ultrasonographically, 
is present in 42.6% of patients with T2DM35. Prevalence 
of NAFLD also increases with BMI, such that in an 
 
unselected Italian population sample 91% of patients 
who were obese (BMI ≥30 kg/m2), 67% of those who 
were overweight (BMI 25–30 kg/m2) and 25% of individ­
uals at a normal weight (BMI 18–25 kg/m2) had ultra­
sonographical evidence of NAFLD36. The prevalence 
of NAFLD among patients matching at least one of the 
Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) criteria for serum 
lipid level alterations is similarly high at 78.8%33.
Data regarding the prevalence of advanced forms of 
NAFLD and NASH in the general European popula­
tion are more limited. A community­based study from 
the Netherlands using a transient elastography reading 
of ≥8 kPa for the diagnosis of liver fibrosis estimated 
that clinically significant fibrosis was present in 5.6% 
(169 of 3,041) of total, nonselected individuals and 8.4% 
(69 of 822) of those with NAFLD, and was positively 
associated with steatosis and T2DM37. In this respect, the 
influence of T2DM on risk of progressive NAFLD is sup­
ported by a UK­based paired­biopsy study that showed 
incident T2DM to be the strongest predictor of progres­
sive disease38. A postmortem study conducted in Greece 
on 498 cases of ischaemic heart disease or traffic accident 
deaths revealed simple steatosis in 31.3% and NASH in 
39.8% of individuals39. In a study of Spanish patients 
with gallstone disease scheduled for cholecystectomy, 
51.6% of them had histological evidence of NAFLD and 
19.8% of NASH40. Of note, in this cohort, ultrasono­
graphy confirmed a fatty liver in only 67.6% of the histo­
logically diagnosed patients with NAFLD. Similar rates 
of NAFLD are reported in healthy  
people evalu 
ated in 
transplantation units as potential living liver donors. In a 
single retrospective study performed in a mixed US and 
Italian cohort in this setting, the histological prevalence 
of steatosis and steatohepatitis was 48.5% and 15.5%, 
resepctively41. However, both NAFLD and NASH were 
more frequently found in Americans compared with 
Italians (54% versus 34% for NAFLD and 17.6% versus 
16.2% for NASH, respectively). The rates of NASH are 
clearly increased in patients referred to tertiary centres 
for NAFLD. In a meta­analysis published in 2016, the 
pooled NASH prevalence in Europe among patients 
with NAFLD with an indication for biopsy was 69.25% 
(95% CI 55.93–79.98%)1.
Incidence of NAFLD and future projections in Europe. 
Only a small number of studies explored the incidence 
of NAFLD in the general population. Over a follow­up of 
8.5 years, the incidence of ultrasonographically detected 
NAFLD was 18.5 per 1,000 person­years in a sample 
representative of the general Italian population36. Data 
gathered in the past few years are clarifying the natural 
history of histologically diagnosed NAFLD. In a Swedish 
cohort of 229 patients with biopsy­proven NAFLD 
with a mean longitudinal follow­up of 26.4 ± 5.6 years, 
patients with NAFLD had increased all­cause mortality 
(hazard ratio (HR) 1.29, 95% CI 1.04–1.59), exhibited 
an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (HR 1.55, 
95% CI 1.11–2.15), HCC (HR 6.55, 95% CI 2.14–20.03) 
and cirrhosis (HR 3.2, 95% CI 1.05–9.81), compared 
with a matched reference population sample42. The pres­
ence of fibrosis was found to be the strongest prognostic 
factor for liver­related events and mortality42. Consistent 
with this finding, the burden of NAFLD­related HCC 
is also increasing dramatically. A study conducted in 
northeast England found that NAFLD­associated HCC 
accounted for 35% of all HCC cases (41 of 118) in 2010, 
representing a greater than tenfold increase in 10 years43. 
Finally, results from the UK National Health Service 
Blood and Transplant Agency show that decompensated 
NASH cirrhosis accounted for an increased proportion 
of patients undergoing liver transplantation (12% in 
2013 compared with 4% in 1995)44.
NAFLD in the Asia–Pacific and Africa
NAFLD prevalence varies widely within the Asia–Pacific 
region, as would be expected from a region comprising 
at least 55 countries with marked disparities in levels of 
economic, political and educational development, and 
which are associated with variations in nutrition, lifestyle 
and sedentary behaviour. Furthermore, there is a bias 
towards reporting studies that emanate from more afflu­
ent economics in the region with better health­care sys­
tems. Unlike data from Europe and North America, data 
from the Asia–Pacific region and Africa are not as com­
prehensive both between and within countries, and there 
is a total absence of this information from many countries.

 Although there are no nationwide epidemiological 
surveys that include an assessment of liver fat, there can be 
striking differences in the prevalence of NAFLD between 
different subnational regions and over time. As an exam­
ple, NAFLD prevalence in the populations of Chengdu 
(southwest China), Shanghai (east China), Guangdong 
(south China) and central China was 12.5%, 15.0%, 
17.0% and 24.5%, respectively45–47. On the other hand, 
an ultrasonography study of 7,152 workers in Shanghai 
published in 2012 suggested that NAFLD prevalence was 
as high as 38.17%48. In Hong Kong, a community­based 
study employing state­of­the­art proton­ 
magnetic 
reso 
nance spectroscopy to quantify liver fat estimated 
a NAFLD prevalence of 28.8%: 19.3% in individuals 
who were not obese and 60.5% among those who were 
obese49. Similarly, in Taiwan, the preva 
lence of NAFLD 
was reported to be 11.4% in the  
general community50 but 
higher in  
certain sub 
populations, including the elderly 
(mean age 70.3 ± 4.6 years, 50.1% prevalence)51 and in 
those with a typically inactive  
lifestyle (66.4% prevalence 
in taxi drivers)52.
The community prevalence of NAFLD was ~25% 
in Japan in 2005, increasing from 12.6% before 1990 
to 30.3% in 1998 (REF. 53). A report published in 2005 
suggests that 23–26% of individuals undergoing routine 
health screening have fatty liver diagnosed by abdominal 
ultrasonography54. Using similar methodology, the preva­
lence of NAFLD in South Korea in 141,610  
individuals 
was 27.3% when reported in 2013  (REF. 55).
South Asia and the Indian subcontinent are currently 
in the throes of rapid economic and social change, with 
trends towards urbanization and an urban–rural eco­
nomic divide. Not unexpectedly, in rural India, a region 
characterized by traditional diets and lifestyles, the preva­
lence of NAFLD is low (~9%), whereas it mimics Western 
prevalence trends in urban populations, with rates 
vary 
ing between 16% and 32%56–58. A similar drama 
tic 
 
variation in NAFLD prevalence between urban and rural 
regions and along racial, economic and cultural bound­
aries (5–30%) was observed from smaller surveys in Sri 
Lanka, Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia59–62. Overall, 
NAFLD prevalence varies but is increasing across Asia. 
Given that this region is subject to the same global forces 
of change towards increased energy­dense food con­
sumption and reduced physical activity, NAFLD rates in 
the East and West are more similar than different, in the 
context of a similar obesogenic environment.
The scant available data on the prevalence of NAFLD 
in Africa suggests that Africans tend to have lower preva­
lence of the condition, consistent with what has been 
reported in African Americans. In Nigeria, NAFLD preva­
lence of 9.5–16.7% in individuals with diabetes and 1.2–
4.5% in individuals without diabetes has been reported63,64. 
Similarly, in South Africa, the prevalence in individuals 
who were obese or overweight was 45–50%65. A small 
population­based study published in 2014  
suggested 
 
a  
prevalence of 20% in the Sudanese population66.
Lean NAFLD
Initially described in Asian populations, NAFLD in the 
absence of obesity, so­called ‘lean NAFLD’
, can develop 
in ~10–20% of Americans and Europeans5,67 (FIG. 2; see 
Supple

This manifestation of NAFLD deserves clinical attention 
as many physicians have a perception that lean NAFLD is 
more benign in nature than NAFLD in individuals who are 
obese. Lean NAFLD encompasses a heterogeneous spec­
trum of disease arising from different aetiologies (BOX 1). 
Increased visceral obesity (as opposed to general obesity), 
high fructose and fat intake and genetic risk factors, includ­
ing congenital defects of metabolism, might be associ 
ated 
with lean NAFLD. A very large proportion of lean NAFLD 
cases probably belong to the ‘metabolically obese, normal 
weight’ pheno 
type79, described in at least 5% of the popu­
lation in the West. This subgroup comprises individuals 
who are non­obese, frequently sedentary, and who have 
impaired insulin sensitivity, increased cardio 
vascular 
risk and increased liver lipid levels, the consequence of 
decreased capacity for storing fat and reduced mitochon­
drial function in adipose tissue and increased hepatic

 de novo lipogenesis79. When compared with patients who 
have NAFLD and are overweight or obese, patients with 
NAFLD who are lean are younger and have a lower preva­
lence of the metabolic syndrome (2–48% versus 22–64% 
in patients who are overweight or obese)67,80. However, 
these patients are usually insulin­ 
resistant and have higher 
plasma triglyceride levels when compared with matched 
controls without NAFLD74,80. In a cohort of patients with 
biopsy­proven NAFLD who were not obese and not dia­
betic, the metabolic milieu was similar to that observed in 
patients with NAFLD who are obese, with  
adipose tissue 
insulin  
resistance having an important role81.
As lean NAFLD is usually present with fewer obesity­ 
related comorbidities, it is commonly believed that this 
subgroup would follow a relatively benign clinical course. 
Within the cohort of the National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Survey III79, mortality of patients with meta­
bolically normal NAFLD was similar to the cohort with­
out liver disease. Unfortunately, most reports are limited 
by the use of imaging modalities rather than liver biopsy 
to confirm the diagnosis of fatty liver5,74,79–84. In a study 
conducted in Italy by Fracanzani et al.82 that included 
430 cases of biopsy­proven NAFLD, 55% of patients 
without visceral obesity had NASH and a fibrosis stage 
≥F2 despite milder metabolic alterations than patients 
who were obese with biopsy­proven NAFLD. In a study 
published in 2017 (REF. 83), similar proportions of patients 
who were obese and non­obese had NASH (51.9% versus 
43.5%, respectively, P = 0.217), although the latter group 
had a lower degree of hepatic steatosis and hepatocyte 
ballooning. Consistent with a report from a decade 
 
earlier79, the proportion of patients with advanced fibro­
sis at baseline was not different between those who were 
obese and non­obese, suggesting that once an individual 
has been diagnosed with NASH, obesity might not be the 
main driver of fibrosis progression. Genetic factors might 
be involved in risk of lean NAFLD, however, the presence 
of NASH in these patients was not explained by muta­
tions in genes that can influence either insulin resistance 
(ENPP1 and IRS1 polymorphisms) or the severity of 
 
steatosis (PNPLA3 and TM6SF2 polymorphisms)82.
The longitudinal risk of mortality in lean NAFLD has 
not been explored in any detail. In the study by Fracanzani 
et al.82 discussed earlier, clinical events occurred in 11.9% 
of patients who were obese and 8.3% of patients who 
were not obese (P = 0.190) after a median follow­up of 
49 months. Cardiovascular events accounted for about 
two­thirds of all major events in both groups. All deaths 
(n = 6) occurred in the obese group, but definitive con­
clusions are difficult to make as follow­up was short. 
An international cohort study including 483 patients with 
biopsy­diagnosed NAFLD with a mean follow­up period 
of over 11 years85, published in abstract form, challenged 
the concept that the prognosis of patients with NAFLD 
who have a normal BMI is benign. Despite presenting 
 
with a healthier metabolic profile and less advanced liver 
fibrosis, median survival free of liver transplantation was 
 
shorter in patients who were lean than in patients who were 
not lean (18.1 versus 26.6 years, respectively, P <0.001).
The final question is how to manage patients who 
are lean and diagnosed with NAFLD, given that it might 
be harder to correct the underlying risk factors in these 
individ 
uals. Careful identification and correction of 
environmental causes, such as substantial fructose con­
sumption, might be particularly effective in children 
and adolescent patients, in whom the intake of sugar­ 
sweetened drinks can be high. Weight loss remains the 
background therapy in all patients with NAFLD and 
overweight or obesity, but habitual physical activity should 
also be emphasized in patients with NAFLD who are 
lean. More studies are urgently needed to understand the 
 
natural history of the disease, but also to promote greater 
awareness among practitioners about the potential health 
risks associated with lean NAFLD.
The future effect of paediatric NAFLD
The obesity rate in children has risen from 5.0% in 1960 
to 16.9% in 2009–2010 (REF. 86). The obesity­ 
related risk 
of future liver disease is alarming, as weight gain during 
school­years carries a higher risk of NAFLD than weight­
gain in late adulthood. In a longitudinal study conducted 
in Denmark87, a weight increase during childhood and 
early adolescence was related to all histo 
logical features 
of adult NAFLD, even after adjusting for initial as well as 
attained BMI. Among children with similar attained BMIs 
at 13 years of age, the risk of cirrhosis in adulthood was 
increased by 16% per 1­unit gain in BMI z­score at every 
age from 7 through 13 years87. Similarly, weight gain dur­
ing late adolescence is able to induce an increased suscep­
tibility to developing NAFLD later in life. Another study 
tested the association of basal BMI on the development of 
end­stage liver disease or liver­ 
related death in a general 
population cohort of 44,248 men aged 18–20 years that 
attended military service in Sweden between 1969 and 
1970  (REF. 88). After a  
follow­up of almost 38 years, being 
overweight in late adolescence increased the risk of liver­ 
related outcomes by 64% compared with those with a low 
to normal BMI, with risk increased 5% for each unit of 
BMI above the  
normal range (BMI 18–25 kg/m2)88. Obesity 
early in life also increases the risk of HCC in adulthood. 
Another study conducted in Denmark that included 
schoolchildren aged from 7 to 13 years old89 showed that

 each unit increase in BMI z­score increased the risk of 
liver cancer by 20–30% 30 years later. In other words, 
compared with an average height and weight 13­year­old 
boy, a boy of similar height but who weighed 6 kg more 
would have a 30% increased risk of HCC89. Besides body 
weight trajectory, other mechanisms seem to influence 
the spectrum of liver damage in NAFLD later in life. 
In the Cardio 
vascu 
lar Risk in Young Finns Study90, after 
a follow­up of 31 years, adult NAFLD was predicted by 
modifiable as well as non­ 
modifiable risk factors during 
childhood, including BMI and plasma insulin levels, male 
sex, genetic background (that is, PNPLA3 and TM6SF2 
variants) and low birth weight, an emerging risk factor 
for adulthood NAFLD. Overall, these observations mean 
that NAFLD and its complications, including HCC, are 
more likely to be antici 
pated at younger age, yielding a 
possible  
reduction of life expectancy and an additional 
societal burden.
Risk factors: nature or nurture?
Evidence from patients that have undergone serial liver 
biopsies over an interval of several years demonstrates 
that the progression of NAFLD from steatosis to NASH 
and fibrosis is not linear and is probably more dynamic 
than previously thought; the fibrosis progression rate 
in simple steatosis is estimated to be 14 years per stage 
of fibrosis, and the fibrosis progression rate in NASH is 
estimated at 7 years per stage of fibrosis. Data published 
in the past few years suggest that risk of liver­related 
mortality in NAFLD grows exponentially as the stage 
of fibrosis increases38,91,92. Furthermore, evidence from 
familial aggregation and twin studies have shown a herit­
able component to NAFLD93,94. Interestingly, the genetic 
susceptibility for the development of steatosis and fibrosis 
might be shared95. Different ethnic groups have disparate 
propensities to advanced disease, with Hispanic individ­
uals being more susceptible than white patients, whereas 
the lowest susceptibility is observed in black individuals96. 
An interesting systematic review suggested that the lead­
ing explanations for the lowest incidence and prevalence 
of both NAFLD and NASH in African Americans in the 
USA is related to genetic differences in lipid metabolism; 
that is, this group have lower serum triglyceride levels and 
higher serum HDL cholesterol levels than patients with 
NAFLD who are Hispanic or white97.
Genetic associations with NAFLD. In NAFLD, genome­
wide association studies have identified novel loci associ­
ated with disease severity phenotypes. A full discussion is 
beyond the scope of this article, but the available liter 
ature 
has recently been reviewed elsewhere98. To date, non­ 
 
synonymous SNPs in two genes in particu 
lar, PNPLA3 
(encoding patatin­like phospholipase domain­ 
containing 
protein 3) and TM6SF2 (encoding transmembrane 6 
superfamily member 2), have most consistently been 
validated as associated with NAFLD in separate large 
cohorts99,100. FIG. 1 shows the geographical distrib 
ution 
of PNPLA3 genotypes in patients with NAFLD. PNPLA3 
is presented as minor allele frequency (that is, the fre­
quency at which the second most  
common PNPLA3 
allele occurs in a population). Among the emerging newly 
 
discovered risk loci, variants near the genes  
encoding 
for membrane­ 
bound O­acyltransferase domain­ 
containing 7 (MBOAT7) and transmembrane channel­ 
like 4 (TMC4) have been shown to be associated with 
development and severity of NAFLD in patients of 
European descent101. Similarly, within the Latino popu­
lation in South America, the TM6SF2 Glu167Lys and 
PNPLA3 Ile148Met protein  
variants seem to confer 
 
susceptibility to progressive NASH102.
Epigenetic factors and NAFLD. Although there have 
been major advances uncovering the genetic basis for the 
heritability of NAFLD, heritable mechanisms other than 
those encoded within the nucleotide sequence of genes 
are emerging. Discordant NAFLD in genetically identical 
twins has been shown to be explained by microRNAs103. 
Epigenetic factors might also be a mechanism through 
which environmental exposures exert a heritable effect 
on disease risk. Remodelling of DNA methylation at key 
fibrosis modifier genes underpinned protection against 
carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)­induced liver fibrosis in male 
offspring of male mice that were themselves subjected to 
CCl4­mediated liver injury104. Remarkably, DNA methyl­
ation remodelling occurred in the same genes in patients 
with NASH with mild fibrosis and intriguing data sug­
gests that epigenetic signatures present on circulating cell­
free DNA could be a potential biomarker of this effect 
and, therefore, disease severity104,105.
Role of environmental factors. Genetic  
predisposition 
must be placed in the context of environmental factors 
that also have an important role. The most rele 
vant fac­
tors are dietary habits, activity and socioeco 
nomic  
factors. 
Although large amounts of data suggest that dietary 
composition might predispose individuals to NAFLD, 
evidence at the population level is less well characterized. 
In this context, a study published in 2014 reported that 
patients with NAFLD tended to reside in areas with many 
food source options including grocery stores, restaurants 
and fast food places. Furthermore, those with NAFLD 
were more likely to report having the unhealthiest eating 
habits (eating processed foods and/or foods with a high 
content of fat, salt and sugar or corn syrup) and reported 
eating more frequently at restaurants106. Other studies 
focused on the nutritional assessments of patients with 
NAFLD have further documented increased consump­
tion of low­nutrient, high­sodium and high­fat foods, 
especially diets high in meat­derived fats and lower 
amounts of fresh fruits107,108. In addition to these dietary 
habits, individ 
uals with fatty liver were found to have very 
low physical activity levels and increased sitting times 
 
compared with healthy individuals109–111.
The prevalence of NAFLD is also related to socioeco­
nomic factors, but their exact role is debated. In a study 
exploring the role of environmental factors in different 
ethnic groups with NAFLD, acculturation, education 
level, health­care use and income, along with dietary and 
lifestyle factors and sleep, were not found to be indepen­
dently associated with risk of developing NAFLD, suggest­
ing that environmental factors might have a role on a 
background of genetic predisposition16.

 Alcohol consumption in the context of NAFLD 
should be carefully considered. Data from the SHIP study 
demonstrates that the presence of obesity and alcohol 
consumption are not mutually exclusive. In patients with 
radiologically diagnosed hepatic steatosis, 27.3% of men 
and 9.7% of women fulfilled criteria for both obesity and 
high alcohol consumption (that is, dual aetiology fatty 
liver disease)112. Prospective data from the UK in 9,559 
men with up to 42­years of follow up unequivocally show 
that alcohol consumption and the presence of obesity act 
synergistically to increase the risk of liver disease mor­
bidity and mortality113. Furthermore, the risk of incident 
HCC is multiplied (HR 7.19, P <0.01) in individuals 
who consume alcohol and are obese relative to non­
obese, non­drinkers114. To fully address the effect of even 
moderate alcohol consumption on NAFLD will require 
prospective, longitudinal studies recording cumulative 
lifetime alcohol consumption.
Overall, these data confirm the concept that NAFLD 
is a complex disease that is affected by inter­related 
environ 
mental factors and genetic predisposition. The 
exact contribution of each of the genetic or environ­
mental components in the promoting the burden of 
NAFLD is not known and could vary in different regions 
of the world. Therefore, future studies need to focus on 
this knowledge gap to better determine treatment and 
improve patient outcomes.
Global perspectives
Challenges for health care. With an estimate of 64 mil­
lion individuals affected in the USA and 52 million in 
European countries1,115, what clearly sets NAFLD apart 
from other common liver diseases is the sheer volume of 
patients. In this context, the major focus of clin 
ical care is 
discerning patients with NAFLD at highest risk for liver­ 
related complications. Joint guidelines on the manage­
ment of NAFLD released by the European Association for 
the Study of the Liver (EASL), European Association 
for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) and the European 
Association for the Study of Obesity (EASO) recommend 
that individuals with obesity or any component of the 
metabolic syndrome should undergo ultrasonography 
and have steatosis biomarkers and serum liver enzyme 
levels measured116. Furthermore, a burning issue is the 
development of HCC in NASH even in the absence of 
cirrhosis, for which no indication is currently provided 
by guidelines116.
Economic burden of NAFLD. As the clinical conse­
quences of NAFLD grow, the economic consequences 
will also increase. A model on the population of US and 
of four European countries (Germany, France, Italy 
and the UK) published in 2016 estimated the annual bur­
den associ 
ated with all incident and prevalent NAFLD 
cases at US$103 billion in the USA ($1,613 per patient) 
and at €35 billion in the four Europe countries (from €354 
to €1,163 per patient)115. In a study of Medicare patients 
with NAFLD, the mean yearly inflation­adjusted charges 
from the outpatient setting increased from $2,624 ± 3,308 
in 2005 to $3,608 ± 5,132 in 2010 (REF. 117). If the annual 
rate of increase in the costs related to NAFLD is assumed 
to parallel the annual growth in the prevalence of obesity, 
the expected 10­year burden of NAFLD could increase to 
an estimated $1.005 trillion in the USA and €334 billion 
in the Europe115.
The main question is whether the enormous cost of 
screening and management would be justified, prov­
ided it will be affordable. Cost–utility analysis of NASH 
screening is hampered by the lack of evidence for benefit 
during the early stages of disease progression, uncertain­
ties around the accuracy of noninvasive markers of liver 
damage and the lack of effectiveness data relating to 
treatment in patients with NASH. Steatosis testing has 
not been recommended by the UK National Institute for 
Health and Care Excellence (NICE) NAFLD Guideline 
Committee owing to the uncertainty both in the cost­ 
effectiveness results for all tests and in the clinical 
evidence base118. On the other hand, the EASL–EASO–
EASD 2016 guidelines and the UK NAFLD Guideline 
Committee recommend biomarkers (NAFLD fibro­
sis score, FIB­4) and transient elastography or acous­
tic radiation force impulse imaging to screen patients 
with NAFLD for advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis116,118. 
Ultimately, screening for NASH will probably be cost­ 
effective when medications with reasonable efficacy and 
adverse effects are available.
Conclusions
NAFLD is now the leading cause of chronic liver dis­
ease in the USA and Europe and is increasing worldwide, 
but there is a paucity of prospective population­based 
cohort studies from other geographical areas, including 
South America, Asia, Australia and Africa, which are 
needed to better understand the global burden of disease 
(BOX 2). Understanding the genetic and environmental 
risk factors of NAFLD and NASH and their distribution 
across different countries is of paramount importance to 
develop strategies to implement a multipronged public 
health policy and deal with this important chronic liver 
disease (BOX 2).
