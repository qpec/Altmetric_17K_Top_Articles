ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder is increasingly recognized to involve functional deficits in both gamma-
aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic and glutamatergic synaptic transmission. To elucidate the relationship between these
phenotypes, we used GABAA receptor γ2 subunit heterozygous (γ21/2) mice, which we previously characterized as a
model animal with construct, face, and predictive validity for major depressive disorder.
METHODS: To assess possible consequences of GABAergic deficits on glutamatergic transmission, we quantitated
the cell surface expression of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-type and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole
propionic acid (AMPA)-type glutamate receptors and the function of synapses in the hippocampus and medial
prefrontal cortex of γ21/2 mice. We also analyzed the effects of an acute dose of the experimental antidepressant
ketamine on all these parameters in γ21/2 versus wild-type mice.
RESULTS: Modest defects in GABAergic synaptic transmission of γ21/2 mice resulted in a strikingly prominent
homeostatic-like reduction in the cell surface expression of NMDA-type and AMPA-type glutamate receptors, along with
prominent functional impairment of glutamatergic synapses in the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex. A single
subanesthetic dose of ketamine normalized glutamate receptor expression and synaptic function of γ21/2 mice to wild-
type levels for a prolonged period, along with antidepressant-like behavioral consequences selectively in γ21/2 mice. The
GABAergic synapses of γ21/2 mice were potentiated by ketamine in parallel but only in the medial prefrontal cortex.
CONCLUSIONS: Depressive-like brain states that are caused by GABAergic deficits involve a homeostatic-like
reduction of glutamatergic transmission that is reversible by an acute, subanesthetic dose of ketamine, along with
regionally selective potentiation of GABAergic synapses. The data merge the GABAergic and glutamatergic deficit
hypotheses of major depressive disorder.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of total
disability with limited treatment options that are often ineffective
(1,2). The etiology of MDD is poorly understood but thought to
involve combinations of endogenous vulnerability factors and
precipitating life events, such as uncontrollable stress (3).
Potential
vulnerability
factors
include
diverse
defects
in
gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic inhibitory neurotrans-
mission, such as reduced concentrations of GABA (4–9),
reduced expression of glutamic acid decarboxylase (10,11),
reduced expression of GABAA receptors (GABAARs) (12), and
impaired function of GABAergic interneurons (10,13,14) [all
reviewed by Luscher et al. (15)].
The GABAergic deficit–induced changes in neural excitability
(16) and reduced glutamic acid decarboxylase–mediated con-
version of glutamate to GABA may conceivably be responsible
for increased glutamate concentrations found in the brains of
patients with MDD (17,18). However, some studies of MDD
point to reduced rather than increased brain content of
glutamate [reviewed by Niciu et al. (19)], suggesting a dynamic
relationship between changes in GABAergic and glutamatergic
transmission. Additional evidence suggestive of altered gluta-
matergic neurotransmission in MDD includes reduced expres-
sion and altered function of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors
(NMDARs) (20,21) and rapid therapeutic efficacy of subanes-
thetic doses of ketamine (22–24). Ketamine exerts antidepres-
sant activity as a noncompetitive antagonist of NMDARs
by ultimately enhancing glutamatergic synaptic transmission
(25,26). Ketamine is especially effective in otherwise treatment-
resistant forms of MDD associated with high anxiety (27).
However, it is unclear how alterations in glutamatergic trans-
mission and antidepressant efficacy of ketamine are functionally
related to GABAergic deficits associated with MDD.

 Stable functioning of neural networks in the face of rapid
changes in neural excitability is critically dependent on
homeostatic self-tuning mechanisms that, on a slower time
course, preserve the balance of excitation and inhibition and
the average firing rates of neurons (28). Homeostatic mecha-
nisms have been studied most extensively in cultured neurons.
Of particular interest in the context of the present study is a
slow form of homeostatic synaptic plasticity whereby pharma-
cologically induced hyperexcitability of cultured neurons is
compensated by global scaling down of glutamatergic syn-
apses and scaling up of inhibitory synapses (29–32).
Mice rendered hemizygous for the γ2 subunit gene (Gabrg2)
of GABAARs (γ21/2 mice) have been extensively characterized
as a model with construct, face, and predictive validity for
anxious MDD (15,33). These mice exhibit a modest impairment
of GABAergic transmission characterized by loss of the γ2
subunit in �15% of GABAARs averaged across brain regions,
with the most prominent reductions in neocortex and hippo-
campus (225% to 235%) (34). The γ2-lacking GABAARs are
functionally impaired as indicated by their reduced channel
conductance (12 vs. 28 pS) and failure to accumulate at
synapses (34–36). Behaviorally, γ21/2 mice exhibit signs of
heightened
anxiety,
despair,
anhedonia,
and
constitutive
stress axis activation, and all these phenotypes are normalized
by long-term treatment with the antidepressant desipramine
(34,37,38). Cognitive alterations of γ21/2 mice in ambiguous
cue conditioning tests mimic emotional pattern separation
defects
associated
with
MDD
(34,39,40).
Moreover,
a
phospho-site mutation that increases the cell surface expres-
sion of γ2-GABAARs has antidepressant-like behavioral con-
sequences (41). Thus, the γ21/2 model lends support for a
causative role of GABAergic deficits in the etiology of anxious
MDD (15,33).
In this study, we explored the consequences of GABAergic
deficits on glutamatergic synapses. We found that γ21/2 mice
exhibit
reduced
cell
surface
expression
and
function
of
NMDARs
and
alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole
propionic acid receptors (AMPARs), along with reduced expres-
sion of the synaptic adhesion molecule neuroligin 1 (NL1) and
defects in the density and function of glutamatergic synapses in
the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex. Similar defects
were observed in γ21/2 cultured neurons. Moreover, treatment
of γ21/2 mice (or cultures) with a subanesthetic dose of
ketamine resulted in lasting ($3 days) enhancement and
normalization of glutamate receptor (GluR) expression and
glutamatergic synapse function. Thus, depression-related brain
states of γ21/2 mice involve a homeostatic-like reduction of
glutamatergic transmission that can be normalized for a
prolonged period by the rapidly acting antidepressant ketamine.
Ketamine also potentiated the function of GABAergic synapses
but only in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). These data unite the
GABAergic and glutamatergic deficit hypotheses of MDD,
suggest that MDD may be caused by aberrant homeostatic
plasticity, and provide novel insights into the synaptic mecha-
nisms underlying antidepressant efficacy of ketamine.
METHODS AND MATERIALS
See the more detailed and complete version in Supplemental
Methods and Materials.
Production and Husbandry of Mice
Two different GABAAR γ21/2 mouse lines were used as part of
this study, with virtually identical germline deletions of exon 8
of the Gabrg2 locus. A first line of γ21/2 mice was maintained
on
a
129X1/SvJ
background
as
previously
described
(34,38,42). A second line was generated on the C57BL/6J
background by mating γ2f/f mice (43) with an oocyte-specific
Cre line followed by outcrossing of the Cre transgene. Mice
used for experimentation were littermates produced by cross-
ing of γ21/2 mice and wild-type (WT) mice. The 129X1/SvJ line
was used for preparation and analyses of cortical cultures as
well as biochemical and electrophysiologic analyses of brain
slices. The C57BL/6J line was used for biochemical and
behavioral experimentation involving ketamine treatment.
Drug Treatments
For treatment of cultures, the drugs were diluted or dissolved in
culture media to the following final concentrations: keta-
mine, 10 μmol/L (Ketaject; Phoenix Pharmaceutical, Inc.,
St. Joseph, MO); D-(-)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid
(D-APV),
100
μmol/L
(Sigma-Aldrich,
St.
Louis,
MO);
bicuculline (BIC), 20 μmol/L (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN);
and Ro 25-6981, 10 μmol/L (Sigma-Aldrich). For treatment of
mice (8–9 weeks old), ketamine (Ketaject diluted to 1 mg/mL in
0.9% saline) was administered at 10 mg/kg (biochemical and
electrophysiologic analyses) or 3 mg/kg (behavioral analyses)
(intraperitoneal injection [i.p.]) as previously described (26,44).
Cell Surface Biotinylation
Cortical cultures from γ21/2 and WT mice were generated from
embryonic day 14–15 embryos (129X1/SvJ line) and subjected
to cell surface biotinylation at 21 days in vitro and purification
using NeutrAvidin agarose beads (Thermo Scientific, Rockford,
IL) as described previously (45). For biotinylation of brain slices,
we adapted the protocol of Terunuma et al. (46). The biotinylated
proteins were quantitated by sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacryl-
amide gel electrophoresis/western blot using an Odyssey CLx
infrared imager (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). Amounts of
cell surface biotinylated proteins were normalized to amounts of
β-tubulin in total extracts quantitated on parallel gels.
Immunofluorescent Staining of Cortical Cultures
Immunofluorescent staining of neurons employed glia-free cortical
cultures prepared from embryonic day 14–15 embryos as pre-
viously described (47). The cells were fixed, permeabilized, and
stained at 21 days in vitro as described (47) using rabbit anti-MAP2
(1:1000, Ab5622; EMD Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA), guinea pig
anti-VGluT1 (1:500, LV1439669; EMD Millipore Corp.), mouse
anti-PSD95 (1:1500, No. 28879; EMD Millipore Corp.), mouse
anti-gephyrin (1:500, No. 147111; Synaptic Systems GmbH,
Goettingen, Germany), and rabbit anti–vesicular GABA transporter
(1:1000, No. 131002; Synaptic Systems GmbH). Synaptic immu-
noreactivities were developed and quantified as described (47).
Electrophysiology
Coronal slices (350 μm) containing the dorsal hippocampus or
ACC were prepared using a vibratome (Leica VT1200S; Leica
Biosystems, Inc., Buffalo Grove, IL) from 7- to 13-week-old

RESULTS
GABAergic Deficits of γ2-Deficient Neurons Result in
Homeostatic Downregulation of GluRs
Chronic blockade of GABAARs in cultured neurons with BIC
results in homeostatic downregulation of NMDA and AMPAR
function (Supplemental Figure S1A) (29). Therefore, to begin to
test whether similar changes in GluR expression might occur in
γ21/2 mice, we began our analyses in γ22/2 and WT cultured
cortical neurons (21 days in vitro). As a proxy for NMDARs, we
quantitated the cell surface expression of the obligatory subunit
GluN1 as well as the GluN2B subunit, which is part of an

that remained elevated thereafter (p ,

cantly increased first at 4.5 hours and

 NMDAR subtype that is implicated in mediating the detrimental
effects
of
excess
glutamate
(48)
and
antidepressant
effects of ketamine (49). In addition, we quantitated the cell
surface expression of NL1, a postsynaptic cell adhesion
molecule that controls the accumulation of NMDARs at syn-
apses (50). Lastly, we surveyed the expression of AMPARs
using antibodies for GluA2/3 subunits. Using cell surface
biotinylation assays, we found that the plasma membrane
accumulation of all four proteins was drastically reduced in
γ22/2 compared with WT cultures (Figure 1A). The cell surface
expression of the same four proteins also was reduced in
γ21/2 compared with WT cultures (Figure 1B), with effect sizes
comparable to those in γ22/2 versus WT cultures (Figure 1A)
and BIC-treated WT cultures (Supplemental Figure S1A).
Total expression of GluN1 and GluA2/3 was unaffected in
γ22/2 compared with WT cultures and BIC-treated WT cultures,
suggesting that the changes at the cell surface were due
to impaired trafficking of receptors (Supplemental Figure S1A,
B).
Therefore,
a
modest
defect
in
GABAAR
function
in
γ21/2 cultures (36,51) leads to a profound downregulation of
GluRs that is reminiscent of homeostatic scaling down of
synapses
induced
by
complete
pharmacologic
blockade
of GABAARs.
Ketamine-Induced Reversal of GluR Deficits
We hypothesized that downregulation of GluRs was related to
the depressive-like brain state of γ21/2 mice (37,38) and that it
should be reversible by antidepressant concentrations of keta-
mine. We treated γ21/2 cultures with ketamine (10 mmol/L) for
variable amounts of time and found that GluN1 cell surface
expression was increased significantly within 3 hours of treat-
ment (Figure 1C). Cell surface AMPARs were increased similarly
but with about a 1.5-hour delay. Ketamine also increased cell
surface expression of NL1, with a time course similar to that of
GluN1 (Supplemental Figure S2A), which is consistent with a
role of NL1 in cell surface trafficking of NMDARs (50). The effect
of 10 mmol/L ketamine on cell surface GluRs of γ21/2 cultures
was reproduced by the GluN2B specific antagonist Ro 25-6981
(10 mmol/L) and the competitive NMDAR antagonist APV (100
mmol/L) (Supplemental Figure S2B, C).
Glutamatergic Synapse Density Is Reduced by
GABAAR Deficits and Normalized by Ketamine
Treatment
To address whether GABAAR deficits and ketamine impact the
density of glutamatergic synapses, we immunostained cultured
cortical neurons for the presynaptic and postsynaptic markers
vGluT1 and PSD95. The density of punctate immunoreactivity for
both markers and their colocalization along dendrites was
reduced in γ21/2 compared with WT neurons (Figure 2A–E).
Treatment of γ21/2 cultures with ketamine (10 mmol/L, 6 hours)
normalized the expression and colocalization of vGluT1 and
PSD95 to WT levels (Figure 2A–E), whereas the size of immunor-
eactive puncta was unaffected by genotype and drug treatment
(Figure 2F). Thus, GABAAR deficit–induced reductions in GluR and
NL1 cell surface expression and their normalization by ketamine
correlate with changes in the number of synapses, rather than a
change in protein accumulation at individual synapses.
GABAAR γ21/- Model Shows Increased Sensitivity to
Anxiolytic-like and Antidepressant-like Behavioral
Effects of Ketamine
Assuming that ketamine-induced surface expression of GluRs
was related to its antidepressant activity, we predicted that
ketamine exerts increased antidepressant behavioral effects in
γ21/2 compared with WT mice. However, preliminary experi-
ments designed to address behavioral effects of ketamine
revealed, inexplicably, that γ21/2 and WT mice maintained on
a 129X1/SvJ strain background failed to show antidepressant-
like behavioral responses to ketamine (not shown), reminiscent
of other mouse strains that are insensitive to ketamine (52,53).
Therefore, we re-derived γ21/2 mice on a C57BL/6J genetic
background, which has been widely used for studies of
ketamine. The anxiety-like phenotype of γ21/2 mice in the
elevated plus maze was fully normalized to WT levels 8 hours
after a single dose of ketamine (3 mg/kg, i.p.), without
effects in WT mice (Figure 3A). Moreover, ketamine had
antidepressant-like consequences in the forced swim test
selectively in γ21/2 mice but not WT mice (Figure 3B). Thus,
γ21/2 mice are more sensitive than WT mice to the anxiolytic-
like and antidepressant-like behavioral effects of ketamine.
GABAAR Deficits of γ21/2 Mice Result in
Downregulation of GluRs In Vivo
To begin to assess the fate of glutamatergic synapses in vivo,
we quantified the cell surface expression of GluRs in acute
brain slices of the hippocampus and the ACC/prelimbic cortex
(PLC), which are among the brain areas with the greatest
GABAAR deficit in γ21/2 mice (34) and essential for antide-
pressant drug–induced behavioral effects in rodents (54,55).
The cell surface AMPARs and NMDARs were drastically
reduced in γ21/2 mice compared with WT mice in both
hippocampus and ACC/PLC (Figure 4A).
Subanesthetic Dose of Ketamine Given to γ21/2 Mice
Normalizes NMDAR Cell Surface Expression In Vivo
To examine whether ketamine affected expression of GluR
in vivo, we treated γ21/2 mice with ketamine (C57BL/6J,
strain, 10 mg/kg, i.p.) and 24 hours later harvested hippo-
campal and ACC/PLC brain slices for quantification of cell
surface proteins. Ketamine treatment of γ21/2 mice resulted in
significant upregulation and normalization of cell surface
NMDARs in both hippocampus and ACC/PLC (Figure 4B).
Expression of the GluN2B subunit appeared increased to
similar levels as GluN1, although the effect was more variable
and significant only in hippocampus. Total expression of
NMDARs remained unaltered, indicating that ketamine acted
posttranslationally to normalize impaired cell surface accumu-
lation of NMDARs. In contrast to NMDARs, cell surface
AMPARs of γ21/2 mice were upregulated by ketamine only
in hippocampus and were unaffected in ACC/PLC (however,
see below for effects of ketamine at 3 days after treatment;
Figure 4C). Moreover, this drug effect in hippocampus involved
increased total expression of AMPARs, rather than merely a
change in cell surface accumulation (Figure 4B). Comparing the
hippocampal cell surface expression of GluRs of ketamine-
treated γ21/2 mice and drug-naïve WT mice (Figure 4A, B, data

Biological
Psychiatry
 normalized to values of drug-naïve γ21/2 mice) indicated that
ketamine fully restored the expression of GluRs from γ21/2 to
WT levels (γ21/2 plus ketamine vs. WT, p 5 not significant,
n 5 9–12, for both GluN1 and GluA2/3, ANOVA, Tukey test).
Given the lasting therapeutic effects of ketamine in pa-
tients (23), we further assessed whether the drug effects on
GluR expression seen 1 day after treatment remained meas-
urable 3 days after treatment. In hippocampus, both GluN1
and GluA2/3 remained significantly elevated compared with
vehicle-treated γ21/2 mice 3 days after treatment (Figure 4C).
By contrast, in prefrontal cortex, the effects of ketamine on
GluN1 were no longer detectable. Instead, there was a strong
trend for upregulation of GluA2/3 that was not observed 1 day
after treatment (Figure 4B, C). Thus, a subanesthetic dose of
ketamine can reverse homeostatic downregulation of gluta-
matergic synapses in the hippocampus induced by impaired
GABAergic transmission for at least 3 days after treatment.
Moreover, ketamine-induced augmentation of AMPAR expres-
sion in prefrontal cortex may be delayed relative to that of
NMDAR and slower than in hippocampus.
Ketamine had no effect on GluR cell surface expression in WT
mice, independent of brain region analyzed (1-day treatment)
(Figure 4D) and consistent with the selective behavioral effects of
ketamine in γ21/2 but not WT mice described in Figure 3.
Downregulation of GluRs was evident in γ21/2 mice of both
genetic backgrounds, C57BL/6J (Figure 4A) and 129X1/SvJ
(Supplemental Figure S1C), suggesting that differential behav-
ioral sensitivity of the two genetic backgrounds to the effects of
ketamine was due to strain differences acting downstream of
altered GluR expression.
GABAAR Deficits Reduce the Number of Functional
Glutamatergic Synapses In Vivo and This Defect Is
Reversed by a Single Dose of Ketamine
We next assessed functional defects in glutamatergic trans-
mission using voltage clamp recordings of CA1 pyramidal cells
in hippocampal slices. The frequency of spontaneous EPSCs
(sEPSCs) was drastically reduced in γ21/2 compared with WT
cells, whereas the amplitude was unaffected (Figure 5A–C).
Ketamine administered to mice 24 hours before recordings
normalized the sEPSC frequency of γ21/2 mice to WT levels
and had no effect in WT mice (Figure 5C). Neither ketamine nor
genotype affected the amplitude of sEPSCs (Figure 5B).
Consistent with results obtained by immunostaining of cul-
tures (Figure 2), these findings suggest that GABAAR deficits

 and

affect
glutamatergic
transmission
through
a change in the number of functional synapses, rather
than through changes in the abundance of AMPARs at
synapses.
Chronic stress has been shown to preferentially affect tempor-
oammonic (TA) synapses onto CA1 pyramidal neurons rather than
Schaffer collateral (SC) synapses (56). To further characterize the
synaptic deficits of γ21/2 CA1 pyramidal cells, we recorded
AMPAR and NMDAR EPSCs evoked by selective stimulation of
either the SC or the TA pathway. The AMPAR EPSC amplitudes
were significantly reduced in γ21/2 compared with WT slices, with
a more pronounced effect at TA synapses (Figure 5D–G). More-
over, ketamine treatment of γ21/2 mice normalized SC-evoked
AMPAR EPSCs to WT levels, without corresponding effects in
WT mice (Figure 5E). At TA synapses, ketamine potentiated the
AMPAR responses, with greater effects in γ21/2 than WT mice
(WT ketamine as % WT vehicle vs. γ21/2 ketamine as % γ21/2
vehicle [F1,163 5 17.73, p , .0001, two-way ANOVA]) (Figure 5F,
G). Similar to AMPAR EPSCs, NMDAR currents of SC-CA1
and TA-CA1 synapses of γ21/2 mice were impaired at base-
line and restored to WT levels by ketamine pretreatment
(Figure 5H–K).
To further examine the idea that the reduced sEPSC
frequency of γ21/2 neurons reflected a reduction in the density
of synapses (Figure 5A, B), we assessed the synaptic release
probability by measuring paired pulse ratios from SC and TA
path-stimulated pyramidal cells (Supplemental Figure S3).
The paired pulse ratios were unaffected by genotype for both
types of synapses and increased by ketamine selectively at
TA-CA1
synapses.
Thus,
genotype-dependent
and
trea-
tment-dependent alterations of glutamatergic transmission
primarily reflect changes in synapse number rather than
release probability. Furthermore, neither genotype nor ket-
amine

affected

stimulation
(Supplemental Figure S4), indicating that the calcium perme-
ability of AMPARs does not play a significant role in the forms
of plasticity examined here.

toward a genotype 3 treatment inter-

Ketamine treatment resulted in an
anxiolytic-like increase in the percen-

percentage of open arm entries (B) showed a significant overall treatment effect (F1,51 = 7.71, p , .008, two-way ANOVA) and a significant anxiolytic-like
effect of ketamine selectively in γ21/- mice (γ21/2 ketamine vs. vehicle, p , .01, n = 12–14) but not WT mice (WT ketamine vs. vehicle, p = not significant,
n = 14–16, Fisher tests). The four groups were indistinguishable with respect to closed arm entries (C) (genotype: F1,51 = 0.52, p = not significant, treatment: F1,51 =

n = 18–27, two-way ANOVA) and a genotype 3 treatment interaction (F1,90 = 4.45, p = .038). Post hoc group comparisons showed a reduced latency to first
immobility specifically in vehicle-treated γ21/2 vs. WT mice (γ21/2 vehicle vs. WT vehicle, p , .001, n = 18–25; WT ketamine vs. vehicle, p . .05, n = 20–21, t tests)
and an increased latency to first immobility in ketamine-treated γ21/2 vs. vehicle-treated γ21/2 mice (γ21/2 vehicle vs. γ21/2 ketamine, p , .01, n = 18–23, t test),
consistent with the depressive-like phenotype previously reported for γ21/2 mice on the 129X1/SvJ background (37,38) and with ketamine-induced changes in
glutamate receptor expression and synapse function that were limited to or greater in γ21/2 vs. WT mice. Measurements of total time spent immobile (E) showed an
overall treatment effect (F1,90 = 9.32, p. , .030, n = 18–27, two-way ANOVA) and an antidepressant-like drug effect specifically in ketamine-treated vs. vehicle-treated
γ21/2 mice but not WT mice (γ21/2 ketamine vs. vehicle, p , .01, n = 18–25; WT ketamine vs. vehicle, p . .05, n = 20–21, Fisher tests).

 Ketamine Enhances GABAergic Synaptic Inhibition
in Frontal Cortex
Ketamine has potent seizure-suppressing effects in animal
models
of
epilepsy
and
in
patients
(57–59).
Therefore,
we wondered whether ketamine-induced potentiation of glu-
tamatergic transmission was accompanied by an increase in
GABAergic inhibition. Comparison of γ21/2 and WT cultured
cortical
neurons
by
immunofluorescent
staining
for
the
presynaptic and postsynaptic markers vesicular GABA trans-
porter and gephyrin revealed a significant reduction in the size
and density of punctate gephyrin immunoreactivity in γ21/2
versus WT cultures, with both of these defects fully reversed

mate receptors in γ21/2 vs. wild-type

(Ket) treatment. (A) The cell surface
expression of GluN1 and GluA2/3 was
reduced in γ21/2 vs. WT mice both
in hippocampus (GluN1, p , .001;
GluA2/3, p , .05, n = 12–13 mice
for both comparisons) and in anterior
cingulate
cortex/prelimbic
cortex
(ACC/PLC) (p , .05, n = 12–13, for
both comparisons). GluN2B cell sur-
face expression was reduced in hip-
pocampus of γ21/2 mice (γ21/2 vs.
WT, p , .05, n = 6–7) and trended
lower in ACC/PLC (p = .15, n = 6–7).
(B) In γ21/2 mice analyzed 24 hours
after an acute dose of ketamine (10
mg/kg, i.p.), the cell surface expres-
sion of N-methyl-D-aspartate recep-
tors (NMDARs) and alpha-amino-3-
hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole

γ21/2 control mice (p , .05, n =

3 comparisons) to levels comparable
to WT mice in (A) (γ21/2 plus keta-
mine vs. WT, p = not significant, n =
9–12). In ACC/PLC, ketamine treat-
ment
of
γ21/2
mice
resulted
in
increased
expression
of
NMDARs
(γ21/2 ketamine vs. vehicle, GluN1,
p , .05) but not AMPARs (GluA2/3,
p = not significant, n = 8–9 for both
comparisons). Cell surface GluN2B
levels trended in the same direction
as GluN1, but the effect was not
significant (p = .12, n = 3). (C) In
hippocampus of γ21/2 mice analyzed
3 days after ketamine treatment, the
cell surface expression of NMDA and
AMPARs remained increased com-
pared with control mice (p , .05,
n
=
10–12,
for
both
GluN1
and
GluA2/3). By contrast, in ACC/PLC,
the
GluN1
cell
surface
level
had
returned to baseline (p = not signifi-
cant, n = 8–9), but the GluA2/3 cell
surface expression showed a strong
trend of an increase (p = .08, n =
6/group) that was not yet evident at 1
day after treatment (B). (D) In WT
mice analyzed 24 hours after keta-
mine treatment, the expression of
NMDA and AMPARs was unchanged
compared with vehicle controls in hippocampus and ACC/PLC (WT vehicle vs. ketamine, p = not significant, n = 5–6, for all four comparisons). Data are from
mice maintained on a C57BL/6J background. The genotype differences were reproduced with 129X1/SvJ mice (Supplemental Figure S1C). Data represent

 after 6 hours of treatment of γ21/2 cultures with 10 μmol/L
ketamine (Figure 6A–G). A modest but significant increase in
the density of gephyrin puncta was also observed in WT
cultures (Figure 6F). Vesicular GABA transporter staining of
γ21/2 cultures was increased by ketamine in parallel with
gephyrin (Figure 6G), suggesting that ketamine potentiated the
postsynaptic apparatus, while increasing the number of
GABAergic synapses in γ21/2 cultures. Consistent with this
interpretation, the colocalization of vesicular GABA transporter
and gephyrin was unaffected by genotype or ketamine

recorded from CA1 and L2/3 ACC pyramidal cells of γ21/2
brain
slices
was
reduced
compared
with
WT,
whereas
the frequency was unaltered (Figure 6I–L). Therefore, γ21/2
neurons display a defect in GABAergic inhibition that is not
compensated for by any process resembling homeostatic
scaling up of inhibitory synaptic strength seen after prolonged
treatment of cultured neurons with BIC. We found that keta-
mine had no effect on mIPSCs recorded from CA1 neurons
of γ21/2 mice (Figure 6I, J). However, ketamine fully restored

 the amplitude of mIPSCs recorded from γ21/2 L2/3 ACC
pyramidal cells to WT levels, along with a prominent increase
in the frequency of mIPSCs observed selectively in γ21/2 mice
but not WT mice (Figure 6K, L). Ketamine did not affect the
amplitude or frequency of mIPSCs of WT mice, consistent with
our other observations that showed that ketamine effects on
GluR expression, synapse density, and emotional behavior
were enhanced or specific for γ21/2 mice representing the
pathologic condition. Glutamatergic synapses of L2/3 pyra-
midal cells were downregulated in γ21/2 mice and restored by
ketamine administration to WT levels (Supplemental Figure
S5A, B), similar to results obtained with CA1 pyramidal cells.
Thus, GABAergic synapses in ACC of γ21/2 mice are poten-
tiated by ketamine both presynaptically and postsynaptically,
in concert with restoration of glutamatergic synapses and
antidepressant behavioral effects.
DISCUSSION
We have shown in the present study that the depression-
related brain state of γ21/2 mice induced by GABAergic deficit
involves a homeostatic-like reduction of glutamatergic trans-
mission. A modest reduction in GABAergic transmission in
γ21/2 mice, consisting of �20% reduction in the mIPSC
amplitude of principal cells, leads to a robust �30%–50%
reduction in cell surface NMDA and AMPARs and �50%
reduction in sEPSC frequency. Hyperexcitability of cultured
neurons induced by chronic BIC treatment is known to result
in homeostatic scaling down of glutamatergic synapses
in concert with scaling up of inhibitory synapses (29,30) and
increased expression of postsynaptic GABAARs (31). Com-
pared with complete (but transient) blockade of GABAARs by
BIC treatment of cultures, γ21/2 mice and cultures display only
a modest reduction of GABAAR function. However, in contrast
to
in
BIC-treated
cultures,
inhibitory
synapses
are
not
strengthened in γ21/2 mice, possibly as a result of the limiting
amounts of γ2-GABAARs. It is conceivable that homeostatic
mechanisms of γ21/2 mice that serve to restore the balance of
excitation and inhibition ended up exacerbating downregula-
tion of glutamatergic transmission. Similar homeostatic mech-
anisms are likely to operate under conditions of chronic or
repeated stress, which are used to model depression in
rodents, involve downregulation of AMPARs and NMDARs
(60), result in increased behavioral responsiveness to ketamine
(61), and hence involve changes in glutamatergic transmission
comparable to changes observed in the γ21/2 model. Chronic
stress also increases the chloride reversal potential, which
renders GABAergic inhibition ineffective or excitatory (62–64).
Thus, stress-induced downregulation of GluRs may be a
consequence of excessive excitatory drive and impaired
upregulation of inhibition analogous to mechanisms observed
in the γ21/2 model. Our findings merge the GABAergic (15,16)
and glutamatergic (21,60) deficit hypotheses of MDD and
provide a novel mechanism for how these two neurotransmit-
ter systems interact in the etiopathology of MDD.
Second, we showed that the GABAergic deficit–induced
adaptations of glutamatergic synapses in γ21/2 mice are
reversed by an acute subanesthetic dose of ketamine. Nor-
malization of GluR expression and synapse density was also
observed in γ21/2 cultures in the continuous presence of
ketamine or APV or Ro 25-6981, whereas WT cultures were
unaffected by ketamine or Ro 25-6981. These observations
suggest that downregulation of NMDARs in γ21/2 cultures and
mice involves excessive or untimely activation of NMDARs,
most likely as a result of chronically increased release of
glutamate. Evidence indicates that the initial effect of a
subanesthetic dose of ketamine is to block a subpopulation
of NMDARs that are active at rest (44), followed by increased
expression of AMPARs (26). Our data extend these findings
and show that initial antagonistic effects of ketamine on
NMDARs are followed by restoration of previously compro-
mised expression and function of postsynaptic NMDARs, in
addition to increased expression and function of AMPARs.
Moreover, the effects of ketamine were greatly enhanced or
specific for γ21/2 mice compared with WT mice (i.e., under
conditions representing the pathologic condition).
Third, we showed that in concert with enhanced glutama-
tergic transmission, ketamine potentiates the presynaptic and
postsynaptic function of GABAergic inhibitory synapses of
L2/3 ACC pyramidal cells of γ21/2 mice. This drug effect
occurred despite the impairment of inhibitory synapses that is
evident in untreated γ21/2 mice. An enduring potentiation of
synaptic inhibition is consistent with the known seizure-
suppressing effects of ketamine (57–59).
Fourth, downregulation of cell surface NMDARs in γ21/2
neurons and its reversal by ketamine were paralleled by
corresponding changes in the cell surface expression of
NL1, a synaptogenic cell adhesion protein that contributes
to activity-dependent balancing of glutamatergic and GABAer-
gic synaptic transmission (65) and controls the synaptic
accumulation of NMDARs (50). Thus, aberrant trafficking of
NL1 may play a key role in maladaptations observed in γ21/2
mice and their reversal by ketamine.
In conclusion, GABAAR deficit–induced downregulation of
cell surface GluRs is reminiscent of chronic stress–induced
downregulation of AMPARs and NMDARs in medial prefrontal
cortex (66–68) and downregulation of AMPARs selectively at
TA-CA1 synapses (56,69). Similar to selective stress-induced
impairment of TA-CA1 synapses, the functional deficit in γ21/2
mice was greater at TA-CA1 than at SC-CA1 synapses (TA-
CA1 γ21/2 as % WT vs. SC-CA1 γ21/2 as % WT [F1,120 =
5.714, p = .0184, two-way ANOVA]) (Figure 5E vs. G). The TA-
CA1 synapses map to distal apical dendrites of CA1 pyramidal
cells that are targets of somatostatin-positive oriens-lacuno-
sum moleculare cells (70). Somatostatin interneurons are
highly sensitive to stress and functionally impaired in patients
with MDD (71). Thus, endogenous or stress-induced GABAer-
gic deficits may be key for stress-induced downregulation of
CA1 pyramidal neuron glutamatergic synapses. Elucidating
the signaling pathways underlying homeostatic plasticity of
GABAergic and glutamatergic synaptic transmission should
lead to novel approaches for the treatment of MDD.
