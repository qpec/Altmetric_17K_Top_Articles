SUMMARY
Age-related human hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) exhaustion and myeloid-lineage skewing 
promote oncogenic transformation of hematopoietic progenitor cells into therapy-resistant 
leukemia stem cells (LSC) in secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML). While acquisition of 
clonal DNA mutations have been linked to increased rates of sAML for individuals over 60, the 
contribution of RNA processing alterations to human hematopoietic stem and progenitor aging and 
LSC generation remains unclear. Comprehensive RNA-sequencing and splice isoform-specific 
PCR uncovered characteristic RNA splice isoform expression patterns that distinguished normal 
young and aged HSPCs, compared with malignant MDS and AML progenitors. In splicing 
reporter assays and in pre-clinical patient-derived AML models, treatment with a pharmacologic

 splicing modulator, 17S-FD-895, reversed pro-survival splice isoform switching and significantly 
impaired LSC maintenance. By comparing splice isoform biomarkers of normal HSPC aging with 
those of LSC generation, splicing modulation may be employed safely and effectively to prevent 
relapse – the leading cause of leukemia-related mortality.
Graphical Abstract
INTRODUCTION
Age-related defects in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) function (Essers et al., 2009) are 
typified by myeloid lineage bias (Pang et al., 2011), altered survival, dormancy and 
regenerative capacity. Microenvironmental alterations (Rossi et al., 2008) and clonal DNA 
mutations in HSCs are acquired during aging and may set the stage for hematopoietic 
malignancy development (Corces-Zimmerman et al., 2014; Genovese et al., 2015; Jaiswal et 
al., 2014; Shlush et al., 2014). Notably, myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), 
myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) and therapy-resistant secondary AML (sAML) harbor 
characteristic splicing factor mutations suggesting that the accumulation of DNA mutations 
over time is a major determinant of lifetime leukemia risk (McKerrell et al., 2015). However, 
these observations do not completely explain the exponential increase in leukemia incidence 
with advanced age (Adams et al., 2015), in part because they do not take into account 
microenvironment-responsive RNA processing events that promote leukemic transformation.
Recent RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) studies comparing aged versus young mouse HSC 
identified changes in TGF-β signaling, epigenetic regulator expression and alternative 
splicing (Sun et al., 2014). Although disruption of cell cycle and differentiation programs 
were identified by RNA-seq at the single cell level during mouse HSC aging (Kowalczyk et 
al., 2015), fundamental differences in mouse and hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell 
(HSPC) pre-mRNA processing (Abrahamsson et al., 2009; Crews et al., 2015; Goff et al., 
2013; Han et al., 2013; Holm et al., 2015; Jiang et al., 2013; Pan et al., 2005) preclude a

 direct extrapolation of these data to human HSPC. Thus, a comparative RNA-seq analysis of 
RNA processing alterations governing human HSPC aging and LSC generation will be 
required to identify mechanisms of therapeutic resistance in sAML.
Seminal studies have shown that subversion of stem cell regulatory pathways (Bonnet and 
Dick, 1997; Eppert et al., 2011), combined with epigenetic alterations and mutations in 
splicing regulatory genes (Bartholdy et al., 2014; Eppert et al., 2011; Lindsley et al., 2015; 
Shlush et al., 2014; Yoshida et al., 2011), portends a poor prognosis in sAML. Recently, pre-
mRNA splicing alterations (Abrahamsson et al., 2009; Adamia et al., 2014; DeBoever et al., 
2015; Goff et al., 2013; Holm et al., 2015), together with RNA editing and lncRNA 
deregulation, were associated with therapeutic resistance in leukemia (Crews et al., 2015; 
Jiang et al., 2013; Trimarchi et al., 2014). With regard to the functional impact of RNA 
processing alterations on therapeutic resistance, we discovered that malignant 
reprogramming of human pre-leukemic progenitors into self-renewing LSC was enhanced 
by missplicing of a stem cell regulatory transcript, GSK3β (Abrahamsson et al., 2009), 
through RNA editing (Crews et al., 2015; Jiang et al., 2013; Zipeto et al., 2016) and pro-
survival BCL2 family splice isoform switching in CML (Goff et al., 2013). Moreover, 
reversion to an embryonic splicing program by MBNL3 downregulation also promoted acute 
leukemic transformation (Holm et al., 2015) and underscored the importance of splicing 
deregulation in human LSC generation.
Recent MDS (Dolatshad et al., 2015) and de novo AML (Adamia et al., 2014) studies 
demonstrate that differential exon usage in epigenetic modifier and tumor suppressor 
transcripts contribute to myeloid malignancy pathogenesis. However, whether differences 
exist in alternative splicing regulation between aged human HSPC and LSC, and whether 
RNA splicing alterations selectively sensitize LSC to splicing modulator therapy had not 
been determined (Bonnal et al., 2012). Thus, we sought to identify RNA processing 
signatures of malignant versus benign HSPC aging and to evaluate the LSC-selective 
efficacy of a pharmacological splicing modulator, 17S-FD-895, a member of the 
pladienolide family of splicing modulatory compounds.
RESULTS
Splice Isoform Signatures of Human Hematopoietic Stem and Progenitor Cell Aging
Mutations in various components of the human RNA splicing machinery (Figure 1A) have 
been associated with age-related hematopoietic malignancies. However, whether normal 
aging sets the stage for RNA processing deregulation in cancer, and whether non-mutation-
based splicing alterations are associated with human stem cell aging or malignant stem cell 
generation has not been established. To generate a comprehensive transcriptome expression 
map of human HSPC aging, we performed RNA-Seq of highly purified normal young and 
aged HSC (CD34+CD38−Lin−) and hematopoietic progenitor cells (CD34+CD38+Lin− 
HPC) from human bone marrow (Figure S1A) followed by whole gene, splice isoform, 
transcription factor and lncRNA analyses. In FACS-purified HSC from aged versus young 
adults, gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA) revealed disruption of vital stem cell 
regulatory pathways such as oxidative phosphorylation, DNA replication, and proteostasis 
(Signer et al., 2014) (Figure S1B, Table S2). In aged versus young HPC, deregulation of

 DNA mismatch repair and recombination and inflammation-associated pathways was 
observed (Figure S1C). Genes encoding signal transduction molecules such as protein 
phosphatases (DUSP1) were commonly upregulated during human HSC and HPC aging. 
Additionally, in aging human HPC, expression of DNA damage (GADD45A, GADD45B) 
and pro-inflammatory genes (CXCL2) was increased (Figure S1D, E; Table S3). Notably, 
KEGG spliceosome pathway genes revealed distinctive expression changes between young 
and aged HSC compared with HPC suggestive of differential splicing regulation during 
aging (Figure 1B, Table S2).
Next, we evaluated splice isoform profiles of aged versus young human HSC and HPC. 
Utilizing an isoform-specific alignment algorithm that incorporates all known transcript 
sequences from Ensembl (GRCh37) (Barrett et al., 2015; Jiang et al., 2013) and a false 
discovery rate (FDR) of <5% (Table S4), we identified splice isoform signatures of human 
HSC and HPC aging (Figure 1C–E) that were distinct from normal young and cord blood 
(CB) progenitors (Figure 1E, S1F). Commonly upregulated transcripts during HSC and HPC 
aging included isoforms of transcription factors and histone regulatory gene products 
(Figure 1F), indicative of a prominent epigenetic contribution to HSPC aging. These 
transcripts were abundant in both aged HSC and HPC, as confirmed in validation cohorts of 
additional young and aged HSC and HPC (Figure S1G).
To investigate the mechanisms governing cell fate commitment during human HSC and HPC 
aging, we utilized a human transcription factor database (Supplemental Experimental 
Procedures) to analyze RNA-seq data. Significantly upregulated transcription factors 
distinguished both aged HSC and aged HPC from their younger counterparts (Figure 1G; 
Table S3). Consistent with a role for inflammation in human aging and myeloid lineage 
skewing of hematopoiesis, we found increased expression of inflammation-responsive 
(NFIL3, IRF1) and myeloid lineage-directing (ETV3, CEBPB) transcription factors in the 
HPC compartment.
Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as key determinants of mouse HSC cell 
fate commitment (Luo et al., 2015) and alternative splicing. LncRNA profiling revealed 
upregulation of the nuclear transcriptional regulator NEAT1 in HSC and HPC, along with 
HPC-specific upregulation of MALAT1 (also known as NEAT2, Figure 1H), which 
influences alternative splicing through regulation of serine/arginine (SR) splicing factors 
(Tripathi et al., 2010). Together, these whole gene and splice isoform expression signatures 
of human HSC and HPC aging identify pathways that are deregulated during stem cell 
aging.
Splicing Deregulation Distinguishes sAML, MDS and Normal Aging Progenitors
To determine if sAML evolves as a result of splicing deregulation in aged and MDS 
progenitors, we performed whole transcriptome analyses of FACS-purified progenitors 
(CD34+CD38+Lin−) isolated from sAML samples along with de novo AML and MDS 
samples (Table S1). Comparative RNA-Seq and GSEA of purified sAML progenitors 
revealed that the spliceosome was the top disrupted KEGG gene set compared with age-
matched progenitors (Figure 2A, Table S2). Additionally, in sAML there was enrichment of 
genes involved in hematopoiesis, cell adhesion, and signal transduction (Figure S2A, B; 
Crews et al.

 Tables S2, S3). Similar to our previous findings of inflammatory mediator upregulation in 
CML LSC (Jiang et al., 2013), GSEA (FDR<25%) of sAML LSC showed upregulation of 
pro-inflammatory signaling and anti-viral response pathways (Figure S2B; Table S2). 
Together, these results suggest that deregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine signal 
transduction mechanisms represents a common feature of HSPC aging and LSC generation.
While mutations in splicing factor genes have been associated with transformation to sAML, 
the role of non-mutation driven splicing alterations has been less extensively studied. Thus, 
we further examined spliceosome components in sAML LSC. Single nucleotide resolution 
analysis of our RNA-Seq datasets for known mutations in MDS/sAML associated loci in 
splicing regulatory genes (Lindsley et al., 2015; Yoshida et al., 2011) revealed only one 
sAML sample harboring a heterozygous mutation in the U2 splicing factor SF3B1, as 
validated by PCR and Sanger sequencing (Figure S2C, Table S5). Quantitative real-time 
(qRT)-PCR analysis of a subset of wild-type SF3B1 samples showed increased SF3B1 
expression in AML LSC (Figure S2C), suggesting that splicing factor gene expression 
alterations in MDS/sAML may occur in a mutation-independent manner. Interestingly, 
GSEA of purified progenitors from MDS samples revealed similar disruption of the 
spliceosome compared with normal age-matched controls (Figure S3A). Pathway-specific 
analyses of RNA-Seq data revealed significant alterations in gene expression of many 
splicing factors in sAML, including upregulation of PRPF6, SF3B2, and ACIN1, and 
downregulation of the SRSF family of splicing regulatory gene products (Figure 2B). 
Among the upregulated transcripts, SF3B2 is a component of the U2 complex that promotes 
splicing, and ACIN1 participates in the exon junction complex (EJC) where it regulates 
production of the pro-survival splice isoform of the BCL2 family member BCL2L1 (BCL-
XL) (Michelle et al., 2012), which contributes to LSC generation (Goff et al., 2013). 
Together, these data suggest that spliceosome disruption is prevalent in sAML and may drive 
splicing alterations of stem cell regulatory genes contributing to LSC generation.
A splice isoform signature of sAML LSC was identified by ranking all significantly 
differentially expressed transcripts (L2FC>1, FDR<5%) from greatest to least distance from 
the origin on a volcano plot (Figure 2C, Supplemental Experimental Procedures). A 
complete list of all significantly differentially expressed transcripts is provided in Table S4. 
The top 75 splice isoform signature of sAML LSC was typified by several alternatively 
spliced signal transduction (PTPN6, PTK2B) and cell adhesion gene products (e.g. CD44 
and ITGB2; Figure 2C, D; Figure S2D; Table S4). Notably, misspliced gene products of the 
non-receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPN6 (also known as SHP-1) and the focal 
adhesion kinase (FAK)-related tyrosine kinase PTK2B (PYK2) have been associated with 
AML (Beghini et al., 2000; Despeaux et al., 2012; Weis et al., 2008) or other hematological 
malignancies (Salesse et al., 2004). Cytoscape analysis of the gene networks associated with 
the top differentially expressed splice isoforms revealed inflammatory signaling genes 
including hubs at PTK2B and the stem cell regulatory factor and adhesion molecule CD44, 
linked by transcription factors such as STAT3 and NFKB1 (Figure 2E, F). Consistent with 
the hypothesis that global spliceosome disruption alters pre-mRNA processing in sAML 
LSC, enriched splice isoforms in sAML included transcripts with retained introns (non 
protein-coding PTPN6-003) and protein-coding transcripts with exon skipping (PTK2B-202; 
Figure 2G, H). In a validation cohort of additional young, aged, and cord blood HPC, the

 sAML LSC splice isoform signature also distinguished between normal and cord blood HPC 
(Figure S2D), and MDS progenitors clustered with sAML LSC when compared with age-
matched HPC (Figure 2D).
To explore the potential clinical relevance of this splice isoform signature, sAML-associated 
transcripts were quantified in TCGA isoform datasets from RNA-Seq studies performed on 
unsorted leukemic cells from 164 AML samples. Unsupervised clustering using the sAML 
LSC splice isoform expression signature revealed six distinct subgroups (Figure S2E). One 
group, consisting of 19 samples (12%), displayed significantly reduced overall survival 
compared with a favorable expression profile observed in a separate group of 10 samples 
(6%), with an overall hazard ratio of 4.26 between these two groups (Figure 2I). These 
TCGA RNA-seq data highlight the potential clinical relevance of LSC splice isoform 
patterns and suggest that they may have utility as prognostic biomarkers.
Recently, MYC-driven cancers were reported to exhibit a high degree of splicing due to 
global upregulation of transcription (Hsu et al., 2015). We hypothesized that a similar 
mechanism may disrupt spliceosome function and promote transcriptome instability in 
sAML. Thus, we established a transcription factor signature of sAML LSC compared with 
normal young and aged progenitors (Figure 2J). Differential gene expression of 
inflammation-responsive transcription factors including STAT6, IRF4, IRF5, and IRF8 
typified sAML progenitors, along with deregulation of several zinc-finger transcription 
factors (Table S3). Notably, decreased expression of tumor suppressor genes, such as TP53 
and IRF8 (Will et al., 2015), could lead to widespread upregulation of transcription, thus 
increasing pre-mRNA burden on the spliceosome. Moreover, lncRNA profiling revealed an 
sAML LSC-specific lncRNA, MEG3 (Figure 2K), which interacts with p53 and regulates 
p53 target gene expression.
Pro-survival Splice Isoform Switching Distinguishes Malignant from Normal Progenitor 
Aging
To further explore the relationship between malignant and normal HPC aging, we utilized 
custom gene sets developed from the splice isoform signatures of HPC aging and sAML. 
Notably, GSEA revealed a negative enrichment score (NES −2.59) of aged HPC-associated 
transcripts in sAML progenitors (Figure 3A). In contrast, select young HPC-associated 
transcripts, such as LAIR1-001, were among the increased transcripts in sAML progenitors 
(Table S4). In keeping with our previous findings of a reversion to a more embryonic 
transcriptome signature in advanced stage leukemias (Goff et al., 2013; Holm et al., 2015), 
LAIR1-001 was also highly expressed in cord blood progenitors (Figure S1F). Moreover, a 
principal components analysis (PCA) demonstrated that expression of HPC aging-associated 
isoforms distinguished young and aged HPC from sAML and MDS progenitors (Figure 3B). 
Additionally, genes associated with sAML-enriched isoforms were highly enriched in MDS 
progenitors (Figure S3B). Other enriched genes sets in sAML versus MDS progenitors 
included several inflammation-associated pathways, along with HPC aging-associated genes 
(Figure S3C).
Alternative splicing has been implicated as a crucial mechanism regulating cell survival and 
LSC generation (Goff et al., 2013; Schwerk and Schulze-Osthoff, 2005). Long isoforms of

 the Bcl2 family of apoptosis regulatory genes, including BCL2, BCL2L1 (BCLXL), 
BCL2A1 (BFL1), and MCL1, promote cell survival, while short isoforms are pro-apoptotic 
(Goff et al., 2013). Notably, GSEA revealed that apoptosis regulators were among the most 
enriched gene sets in sAML compared with normal age-matched controls (Figure 3C). In 
particular, expression of a pro-survival isoform, BCL2L1-001 (BCL-XL), was increased in 
sAML (Figure 3D). In contrast, aged HPC had decreased pro-survival BCL2 isoform 
expression (FDR<10%; Figure 3E, F). Hence, pro-survival splice isoform switching may 
have clinical utility in predicting malignant HPC aging.
Selective Spliceosome Modulation Reverses sAML Splicing Deregulation In Vitro
Based on spliceosome deregulation patterns in sAML LSC and a recent report showing that 
aberrant splicing represents a therapeutic vulnerability in MYC driven solid tumors (Hsu et 
al., 2015), we hypothesized that pharmacological spliceosome modulation might have potent 
LSC inhibitory effects. Several natural products with anti-tumor properties, including the 
macrolide pladienolide B, target the SF3B subunit of the spliceosome (Kotake et al., 2007). 
Until recently, structural complexity constrained development. The natural product 
pladienolide B and derivatives, including FD-895 (Villa et al., 2012), demonstrate poor 
stability in aqueous and biological media. The short half lives (t1/2≤15 min) of these 
compounds and toxicity (Hong et al., 2014) arising from hydrolyzed seco-acids highlight the 
need for development of stabilized and selective spliceosome-targeted compounds. We 
previously described a series of synthetic analogues of FD-895 that demonstrate enhanced 
activity and metabolic stability, including a stereoisomer (17S-FD-895) with 25-fold higher 
activity (Villa et al., 2012). Thus, we evaluated FD-895 and 17S-FD-895 (Figure 4A) in 
splicing reporter activity, PCR, and functional hematopoietic progenitor assays.
In a dual fluorescence splicing (pFlare) reporter assay (Stoilov et al., 2008) (Figures 4B and 
S4A, B), there was a dose-dependent increase in RFP/GFP ratios in HEK293 cells (Figures 
4B and S4C) indicative of potent spliceosome disruption. Time-lapse confocal fluorescence 
microscopy confirmed increased RFP fluorescence following 17S-FD-895 treatment (Movie 
S1). In keeping with previous research showing pladienolide derivatives alter intron 
retention of DNAJB1 (Kotake et al., 2007), PCR demonstrated a time- and dose-dependent 
increase in DNAJB1 intron 2 levels following 17S-FD-895 treatment of MOLM-13 sAML 
cells, which occurred as rapidly as 30 minutes after the initiation of treatment (Figure 4C) 
and to a lesser extent in KG1a AML cells and HEK293 cells (Figure 4D, E). Because 
previous studies involving genetic and pharmacologic modulation show SF3B1 inhibition 
alters splicing and pre-mRNA nuclear retention (Kaida et al., 2007) of vital cancer-related 
and cell survival transcripts (Wang et al., 2011), such as MCL1 (Kashyap et al., 2015), we 
analyzed MCL1 isoform expression. PCR analyses revealed that pharmacologic splicing 
modulation triggered MCL1 exon 2 skipping, producing MCL1-S. At high concentrations, 
17S-FD-895 treatment induced an array of other intron-retained and unspliced products 
specific to sAML cells (Figure 4F, G), suggesting that sAML cells harbor marked sensitivity 
to splicing modulation. In addition, 17S-FD-895 reduced expression of the sAML-associated 
transcript PTK2B-202 (Figure 4H), indicating splicing modulation could suppress sAML 
splice isoform expression patterns, or favor survival of cells with less-perturbed spliceosome 
function.

 Splicing Modulation Impairs LSC Maintenance in Stromal Co-cultures
Previous studies identified an in vitro therapeutic index for FD-895 (the parent compound 
for 17S-FD-895), in CLL cells compared with normal B cells (Kashyap et al., 2015). 
However, the LSC inhibitory efficacy of FD-895 was not established. Moreover, decreased 
in vivo stability limited potential clinical utility. Thus, we compared FD-895 with the more 
stable analogue, 17S-FD-895, in LSC-supportive stromal co-culture assays (Figure 5A) 
(Crews et al., 2015; Goff et al., 2013). Hematopoietic progenitor assays demonstrated a 
dose-dependent reduction in AML LSC clonogenicity and self-renewal (Figure 5B, C; S5A) 
with a favorable therapeutic index after two weeks of stromal co-culture (Figure S5B) with 
17S-FD-895 (Figure 5C) compared with vehicle-treated and normal controls. Notably, 
sAML samples were more sensitive to splicing modulation than relapsed de novo AML 
(Figure 5D). In normal bone marrow HSPC, minimal changes were observed in myeloid 
colony survival, with no significant effects on erythroid colony maintenance (Figure S5C). 
Normal CB samples were unaffected by splicing modulator treatment even at high doses, 
possibly due to differences in their splice isoform expression profiles compared with aged 
normal controls (Figure 5D, S1F, S2D).
Because SF3B1 has been implicated as a target of 17S-FD-895, we performed lentiviral 
shRNA SF3B1 knockdown studies in MOLM-13 cells, primary CD34+ HSPC and AML 
samples. Colony formation and serial replating assays revealed that aged HSPC survived 
lentiviral-shRNA SF3B1 knockdown while AML samples and MOLM-13 cells were 
exceptionally sensitive (Figure S5D–G), indicating that the spliceosome represents a 
therapeutic vulnerability in AML.
Splicing Modulation Impairs LSC Maintenance While Sparing Normal Hematopoietic Cells 
In Vivo
Since the 17S-FD-895 analogue showed a favorable therapeutic index and greater functional 
potency than FD-895 in LSC assays, we performed pre-clinical 17S-FD-895 efficacy studies 
in normal HSPC and AML primagraft models (Figure 6A). Consistent with in vitro normal 
HSPC assays, 17S-FD-895 treatment of normal cord blood CD34+ cell engrafted mice 
showed no effect on total human hematopoietic cell or HSPC survival (Figure S6A, B). 
Transplantation of CD34+ LSC-enriched fractions from three AML patient samples (Table 
S1; Figure S6C, D; n=25 mice transplanted with primary human cells) serially engrafted 
human LSC (n=111 mice) after 7–28 weeks (Figure S6E). Because of relatively high human 
engraftment, two sets of engrafted mice were deemed to be amenable to statistically 
quantifiable treatment with 17S-FD-895 (n=13) or vehicle control (n=9), followed by FACS, 
RNA-Seq, and splice isoform PCR analyses (Figure 6A). The treatment was well tolerated, 
with no significant weight changes detected (Figure S6F). In contrast to the in vivo normal 
HSPC model (Figure S6B), FACS analysis revealed a decrease in human HSPC frequency in 
the spleens of AML primagrafted mice treated with 10 mg/kg of 17S-FD-895 compared with 
vehicle (Figure 6B, C; S6G). Because LSC have been detected in CD34+CD38− or 
CD34+CD38+ compartments (Eppert et al., 2011), which are comprised of an expanded 
granulocyte-macrophage progenitor (GMP) population (Goardon et al., 2011; Jamieson et 
al., 2004), we analyzed these subpopulations in hematopoietic tissues of treated mice. In 
17S-FD-895 treated mouse bone marrow, leukemic GMP frequency was significantly

 reduced resulting in reversion to normal progenitor frequencies (Figure 6D, S6G). 
Consistent with the impaired LSC replating potential observed after 17S-FD-895 treatment, 
serial transplantation studies revealed a marked decrease in human leukemic cells in 
recipients of CD34+ cells from mice in the 10 mg/kg treatment group versus vehicle controls 
(Figure 6E) in all hematopoietic tissues analyzed. In a de novo AML primagraft model with 
high disease burden (Figure S6H), there was a similar trend towards decreased circulating 
leukemic cells in secondary recipients of CD34+ cells from mice treated with a lower dose 
of 17S-FD-895 (Figure S6I). Taken together, these data demonstrate that short-term 
treatment with a pharmacological splicing modulatory compound reduced AML LSC burden 
and self-renewal potential in serial transplantation assays.
To quantify splice isoform modulation by 17S-FD-895 in the primagraft setting, human 
CD34-selected cells from treated mice were analyzed by RNA-seq, PCR and splice isoform-
specific qRT-PCR. Consistent with in vitro 17S-FD-895 mechanism of action studies, PCR 
analyses demonstrated increased DNAJB1 intron 2 retention and a significant reduction in 
BCL2L1-L/S or BCL2-L/S and MCL1-L/S expression ratios in CD34+ cells from 17S-
FD-895-treated compared with control mice (Figure 7A–D; S7A–C). Pooled CD34+ cells 
from 17S-FD-895-treated mice used for serial transplantation assays displayed MCL1 exon 
skipping and intron inclusion, along with significantly reduced MCL1-L/S expression ratios 
(Figure 7E; S7D). Comparative RNA-Seq analysis was performed on CD34+ cells pooled 
from the spleens and bone marrow of each group of treated AML primagrafts. GSEA 
included all KEGG pathways and custom gene sets comprising genes related to 
overexpressed splice isoforms in sAML versus normal progenitors (“sAML up”), and the 
genes associated with decreased isoforms in sAML vs normal age-matched progenitors 
(“aged up”). As expected, the “sAML up” signature was enriched in cells isolated from 
vehicle-treated mice (Figure S7E). Conversely, the “aged up” signature was enriched in the 
10mg/kg 17S-FD-895 treated mice (Figure S7E), suggesting that reversion to an aged splice 
isoform signature is a biomarker of LSC eradication. Moreover, expression profiles of genes 
associated with differentially expressed transcripts identified in the sAML versus normal 
bone marrow HPC signature (Figure 2E) showed opposite trends in bone marrow from 
treated mice (Figure 7F), supporting a trend towards reversion to a normal bone marrow 
transcriptome profile.
To further investigate specific molecular signatures of in vivo response to 17S-FD-895, 
sAML-associated transcripts (Table S4) were assessed to identify those that changed 
(absolute L2FC>0.5) in response to the higher treatment doses in both bone marrow and 
spleen. Notably, sAML-specific transcripts, such as STAT6-016 and ITGB2-201, reverted to 
a normal expression pattern (Figure 7G). Notably, PTK2B transcripts were decreased after 
treatment in both spleen and bone marrow (Figure 7G). Notably, TCGA splice isoform 
analyses revealed that low AML LSC splice isoform levels were associated with improved 
overall survival (Figure 7H). Moreover, RNA-Seq data from primagrafted mice showed 
normalization of expression levels of several splicing factor genes that were disrupted in 
sAML (Figure S7F), further supporting the possibility that splicing modulation can restore 
HSPC splicing patterns by favoring survival of cells with more normal spliceosome function 
and splice isoform expression profiles. SF3B1 expression levels were unchanged after 
treatment in individual mice and in pooled samples utilized for serial transplantation studies

 (Figure S7G–I). Thus, pharmacological splicing modulation with 17S-FD-895 promoted 
reversion to a normal splicing pattern typified by a reduction in sAML-specific transcripts 
and pro-apoptotic BCLX-L, BCL2 and MCL1 splice isoform switching. Cumulatively, these 
data suggest that inhibition of pro-survival gene splicing may contribute to the impairment 
of AML LSC maintenance by 17S-FD-895.
DISCUSSION
The heterogeneity of molecular abnormalities in sAML combined with a paucity of effective 
treatment options has resulted in high relapse-related mortality rates. In addition to approved 
therapies, such as the DNA-modifying agents 5-azacytidine and decitabine, many 
experimental agents also target epigenetic regulators of gene expression in clinical trials for 
sAML (Kantarjian et al., 2010). However, most of these agents fail to improve patient 
survival (Burnett et al., 2013), suggesting that epigenetic modifier therapies may reduce 
leukemic burden but may not effectively target a subpopulation of therapy resistant LSC that 
drive relapse. Hence, there is a critical need for developing clinical candidates with different 
modes of action.
Here, we demonstrate that selective splicing modulation impairs AML LSC maintenance 
and promotes splicing patterns more typical of normal aged HPC expression profiles. 
Comparative RNA-Seq analyses demonstrate that aging human progenitors display pro-
apoptotic BCL2 splice isoform switching, while sAML LSC favor pro-survival expression of 
BCL2L1 (Bcl-xL). Notably, global spliceosome deregulation sensitizes therapy-resistant 
AML LSC to pharmacological splicing modulation. In particular, a potent and stable FD-895 
analogue, 17S-FD-895, reverted sAML isoform expression and pro-survival BCL2 family 
splicing patterns, and reduced AML LSC survival and self-renewal in a dose-dependent 
manner in pre-clinical models. Moreover, 17S-FD-895 exhibited a favorable therapeutic 
index, impairing LSC maintenance while sparing normal HSPC in humanized hematopoietic 
progenitor assays.
Alternative splicing occurs in up to 95% of human multi-exon genes during human 
development and aging (Johnson et al., 2003; Pan et al., 2005), and widespread changes in 
pre-mRNA splicing have been implicated in various age-related disorders (Mazin et al., 
2013). Seminal DNA sequencing and microarray gene expression studies suggest that the 
risk for transformation to AML is governed by mutations in splicing-related genes (Graubert 
and Walter, 2011; Li et al., 2011) and epigenetic modifiers of gene expression (Graubert and 
Walter, 2011; Yoshida et al., 2011). However, the contribution of mutation-dependent or 
independent spliceosome alterations and other primate-specific RNA processing alterations 
to LSC generation has not been elucidated.
Here, we provide RNA-Seq based whole transcript, lncRNA and splice isoform expression 
signatures of human HSC and progenitor aging. Together, these whole gene and splice 
isoform expression signatures of identify key pathways that are deregulated during human 
stem cell aging. Unlike HSC, HPC harbor select alterations in inflammatory pathways and 
alternative splicing of pro-survival genes during aging that may be utilized as biomarkers of

 premature aging and to identify the therapeutic index provided by splicing modulator 
therapy.
In contrast to normal aging, widespread disruption of splicing factor gene expression and 
alternative splicing was observed in sAML LSC and MDS progenitors. Recent studies 
implicate the spliceosome as a therapeutic vulnerability in solid tumors (Hsu et al., 2015), 
and here we show that pharmacological splicing modulation with a potent and stable SF3B1-
targeted agent selectively eradicated sAML LSC and promoted BCL2 family splice isoform 
switching, while sparing normal stem and progenitor cells. Notably, genetic and epigenetic 
alterations typical of AML can induce dependence on BCL2 pro-survival activity (Chan et 
al., 2015). Moreover, a recent study demonstrated that BCL2-targeted small molecules have 
the capacity to rejuvenate aged HSC in mice, and may represent a new class of anti-aging 
molecules (Chang et al., 2016). Thus, splicing modulation leading to BCL2 family splice 
isoform reprogramming may represent a key component of therapeutic strategies aimed at 
inducing selective clearance of senescent HSC during normal aging, and eradicating 
therapy-resistant AML LSC. The results of the present study indicate splicing modulation 
impairs LSC maintenance primarily through reducing LSC self-renewal, which has direct 
relevance to the treatment of a variety of advanced stage hematopoietic malignancies and 
cancer stem cell-driven solid tumors (Barrett et al., 2015; DeBoever et al., 2015; Ferrarese et 
al., 2014; Salton et al., 2015). Additionally, these studies provide the necessary rationale for 
carrying out pharmacokinetic analyses including in vivo monitoring of 17S-FD-895 and 
potential generation of breakdown products, to provide important information on the 
stability and distribution of this compound compared with less stable spliceosome-targeted 
small molecules (Hong et al., 2014).
In addition to establishing the in vitro and in vivo LSC inhibitory efficacy of a potent 
splicing modulatory agent, 17S-FD-895, at doses that spare normal hematopoietic cells, 
RNA-seq analyses distinguished sAML LSC-specific splice isoforms that may represent 
predictive biomarkers of disease progression that would enable early intervention. 
Furthermore, normal versus malignant aging splice isoform switching profiles could be 
exploited in companion diagnostics to evaluate the efficacy of splicing modulators or other 
LSC-targeted agents. Together, these results support further development of splicing-
targeted LSC eradication strategies, representing an important step forward in preventing 
disease relapse in AML and other recalcitrant malignancies typified by splicing deregulation 
(Mazin et al., 2013).
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Patient Samples and HSPC Purification
A collection of AML and MDS patient samples from peripheral blood or bone marrow 
(Table S1) and normal age-matched controls (Figure S1A) were obtained from patients who 
gave informed consent in accordance with Institutional Review Board-approved protocols at 
UCSD (Human Research Protections Program) and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research 
Center’s Leukemia Repository. Bone marrow samples from young donors (Figure S1A) and 
CB were obtained from AllCells (Alameda, CA). Purified human HSPC and LSC were

 isolated by FACS and processed for RNA extraction as previously described (Jiang et al., 
2013).
Whole Transcriptome Sequencing Analyses
Gene and isoform expression values in FPKM were obtained from RNA-Seq data essentially 
as previously described (Jiang et al., 2013) and as detailed in the Supplemental Experimental 
Procedures. Similar to previous reports (Kirschner et al., 2015), for each comparison, 
positives for differentially expressed transcripts were identified by the L2FC of the per-
group average FPKM+1, then a Benjamini-Hochberg FDR correction was applied using the 
p.adjust method in the R statistical package. RNA-sequencing data will be deposited in a 
publicly available database and the accession number is currently pending. In the interim, 
please send requests for human genetics data related to this manuscript directly to the 
authors and we will supply the relevant raw data.
Chemical Synthesis and Preparation of Splicing Modulatory Compounds
Synthesis of FD-895 and 17S-FD-895 compounds was performed as previously described 
(Villa et al., 2012). For in vivo studies, 17S-FD-895 was prepared in DMSO at a 
concentration of 10 mg/mL.
In vitro Stromal Co-Culture and Splicing Modulation
As previously described (Goff et al., 2013), humanized bone marrow SL/M2 monolayers 
were inactivated (irradiated) and then human CD34+ cells selected from AML primary 
samples and normal controls were added for two weeks of co-culture, followed by 
methylcellulose-based colony and replating assays. FD-895 or 17S-FD-895 were added at 
the initiation of co-culture, with DMSO as a vehicle control.
AML LSC Primagraft Assays and In Vivo 17S-FD-895 Treatment
All animal studies were performed in accordance with UCSD and NIH-equivalent ethical 
guidelines and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Three 
AML primagraft models were established from AML LSC-enriched cell fractions (1–2 × 
105 CD34+ cells) transplanted intrahepatically into neonatal Rag2−/−γc−/− as previously 
described (Abrahamsson et al., 2009), or intravenously into sublethally irradiated adult (6–8 
weeks old) NOD/SCID-IL2RG mice (NSGS, Jackson Laboratory) (Figure S6). AML-
engrafted mice were dosed intravenously with 17S-FD-895 (5–10 mg/kg) or vehicle (15–
20% DMSO in PBS) three times over a two-week period (day 1, day 7, and day 14). After 
treatment, hematopoietic tissues were analyzed as described in Supplemental Experimental 
Procedures.
Additional study design, methods, and detailed statistical analyses are described in 
Supplemental Experimental Procedures.

 Figure 1. Splice Isoform Signatures of Human Hematopoietic Stem and Progenitor Cell Aging
Whole transcriptome sequencing was performed on RNA from FACS-purified HSC 
(CD34+CD38− Lin−) and HPC (CD34+CD38+ Lin−) cells from normal young and aged 
samples (HSC: n=4 young, n=4 aged; HPC: n=6 per group plus a validation set of 2 
additional samples per group). Gene and isoform expression data in FPKM were used to 
calculate average log 2 fold change (L2FC) and p values and FDR correction.

 Figure 3. Splice Isoform Switching Distinguishes Malignant from Normal Progenitor Aging
Gene and isoform expression data in FPKM were obtained from sAML LSC, MDS 
progenitors, and normal aged and young HPC RNA-Seq datasets using Cufflinks. GSEA 
was performed using all KEGG pathways plus custom gene sets including genes associated 
with the top differentially expressed transcript signatures in aged versus young HPC, and 
sAML versus aged HPC. Specifically, the sets of genes associated with isoforms that were 
enriched (AGED_VS_YOUNG_SPLICE_ISOFORM_SIGNATURE_GENES_AGED_UP) 
or depleted 
(AGED_VS_YOUNG_SPLICE_ISOFORM_SIGNATURE_GENES_YOUNG_UP) in HPC 
aging were used to query the sAML versus aged normal progenitor datasets for GSEA. 
Similarly, the sAML signature was used to generate a custom gene set representing genes 
associated with isoforms enriched 
(SAML_VS_AGED_SPLICE_ISOFORM_SIGNATURE_GENES_SAML_UP) or depleted 
(SAML_VS_AGED_SPLICE_ISOFORM_SIGNATURE_GENES_AGED_UP) in sAML.
