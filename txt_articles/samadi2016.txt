Abstract
Background: To define the pathologic and functional outcomes of men 50 years of age and younger with prostate cancer in a
contemporary robotic cohort, this study was designed.
Methods: Patients undergoing robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy from April 2002 to April 2012 (n ¼ 2,495) formed the base
population for the current analyses. The patients were dichotomized according to their age r50 (n ¼ 271) and 450-year-old (n ¼ 2,224).
Clinicopathological and health-related quality-of-life outcomes were recorded and analyzed for differences. Propensity score matching was
used when assessing urinary and sexual function outcome.
Results: Baseline prostate-specific antigen and clinical stage were similar between men older than 50 years and those younger. Younger
patients had less severe disease (D'Amico risk and Gleason scores) and smaller prostates. Young men had higher rates of erectile function at
all time points, including baseline (94% vs. 83% at 12 mo, P o 0.01). Continence was similar at all time points except for 6 months, where
younger patients experienced a faster return than older patients and then remained constant, while older patients continued to improve (96%
vs. 89%, P o 0.01). After matching process, the difference in erectile function at 6-month follow-up was lost.
Conclusion: Most men aged 50 years and younger who received robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy had clinically significant
prostate cancer. Although histopathologic and short-term oncologic outcomes were nearly identical when compared to older patients,
younger men had a more rapid and superior return of erectile function. r 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction
Prostate cancer remains the most common cancer among
men in the United States. Prostate cancer detection has
increased over previous years. With the widespread use of
prostate-specific antigen (PSA), incidence of prostate cancer
increased over the previous decade, contributing to a 5.7-
fold increase in the detection of prostate cancer in younger
American men [1]. In Australia, the incidence of prostate
cancer in the past decades has experienced a 17-fold
increase in men younger than 50 years, even without a
nationwide screening program [2]. Although United States
Preventive Task Force has commented against the wide-
spread use of PSA in general population as cancer screening
tool due to ineffectiveness in lowering mortality, recent
debates on the methodology of the interpreted data chal-
lenge the practice recommendation [3].
Early detection of prostate cancer has resulted in early
treatments, and survival data suggest 98.9% 5-year survival
based on 2005 to 2011 data reported by Surveillance,
Epidemiology, and End Results Program [4]. Prior reports
have shown differences in the pathologic features between
younger and older men, but the results have been contra-
dictory. Studies conducted before the PSA era suggested that
younger patients had more aggressive tumor characteristics

 than older men [5,6]. More recent analyses, however, have
demonstrated that younger patients had better outcomes than
a corresponding older cohort [7–10]. Furthermore, men at
age r50 years presumably are healthier and have better
baseline functional status than older men. As postoperative
outcomes are highly correlated with preoperative functional
status [11,12], it is reasonable to expect that younger men
would
have
improved
functional
outcomes
following
prostatectomy.
To address these issues, we reviewed the histopatho-
logic, oncologic, and functional outcomes of a large
contemporary prostatectomy database, comparing men 50
years of age or less to the remainder of the cohort.
2. Materials and methods
After institutional review board approval, we retrospec-
tively reviewed our prospectively maintained, oncologic
database for all patients undergoing robotic-assisted laparo-
scopic prostatectomy (RALP) by a single surgeon between
April 2002 and April 2012. Patients were dichotomized into
2 following groups according to their age at surgery: r50
and 450-year old.
Functional outcomes and PSA were collected at baseline,
6 weeks, and then every 3 months for the first year after
surgery. The International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS)
and Sexual Health Inventory for Men (SHIM) were used for
functional outcome assessments. The SHIM and IPSS were
administered before surgery and collected during office
visits at each patient's follow-up appointment. Categorical
potency and continence were also assessed by our medical
staff. Continence was defined as the use of either no pads or
1 security pad daily [13]. Postoperative erectile function
was defined as an erection sufficient for intercourse
(categorically) or a SHIM score Z17 with or without the
use of phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors in patients who
attempted sexual activity and were preoperatively without
erectile dysfunction [14]. A postoperative PSA 4 0.2 ng/ml
beyond 6 weeks from surgery was considered as biochemical
recurrence [15]. Patients with inadequate follow-up data,
inadequate functional status before surgery, and missing
demographic variables, were excluded.
The prostate specimen was sectioned in 4 quadrants and
mounted in standard fashion. Volume of cancer was
estimated based on the percentage of slides containing
tumor (the positive-block ratio) [16]. Tumor at the inked
resection margin was considered a positive surgical margin
(PSM), which was dichotomized into “focal” or “extensive”
if the length of the PSM was less than or greater than 2 mm,
respectively.
2.1. Statistical analysis
Preoperative and pathologic characteristics of patients
undergoing
RALP
were
calculated
using
means
for
continuous variables and proportions for categorical varia-
bles. Significance was defined as P o 0.05 and was
calculated using t tests for continuous variables and chi-
square tests for categorical variables. Biochemical disease-
free
survival
was
calculated
using
the
Kaplan-Meier
method. Median and interquartile range were used for
follow-up data. Multivariable analysis of standard predic-
tors of potency was calculated using backward stepwise
regression. All tests were two-sided. To further analyze the
results of the study, a propensity score matching method
was used. Characteristics including race, American Society
of Anesthesiology (ASA) risk assessment, D'Amico classi-
fication, urinary continence, and potency status before
surgery were used to select proper matches for young
patients in elderly group. The propensity scoring and
matching process was done via R statistical software
essential package for SPSS. Matching procedure was
performed using “MatchIT” package in R. Matching with
replacement was performed and propensity score with an
absolute bias measure of o0.2 was obtained. The matching
process included a 1:7 match ratio. Further analyses
including graphical representations were conducted using
SPSS versions 17.0 (SPSS, Inc. Chicago, IL) and 22.0
(IBM, Inc. Armonk, NY).
3. Results
Of patients undergoing RALP, 2,495 patients had
clinical, demographic, and follow-up data eligible for the
analyses. Of the patients eligible for the study, 271 (10.8%)
were 50 years of age or younger and 2,224 were older than
50 years. In the younger cohort, prostate biopsy was
performed for elevated PSA in 223 patients (82.4%),
abnormal digital rectal examination in 37 (13.6%), and
combined abnormal digital rectal examination and elevated
PSA in 11 (4.0%).
The mean age of the younger cohort was 46.9 � 3.0,
compared with 61.2 � 5.8 in the older group (P o 0.001).
A family history of prostate cancer was present in a larger
proportion of the younger cohort than the older cohort (36%
vs. 26%, P o 0.01). Similarly, African American men
represented a larger portion of the younger group (21.4%
vs. 10.3%, P o 0.001). The younger patients also had a
superior ASA score, a crude measure of overall health
(P o 0.001). Younger patients had lower D'Amico risk
overall comparing to older group (P ¼ 0.01) and had lower
Gleason scores at biopsies (P ¼ 0.02) (Table 1).
Functionally, the 2 groups had similar rates of preoper-
ative continence, but the younger patients had higher rates
of preoperative potency, 87.8% compared with 73.9%
(P o 0.001). The younger cohort also had lower scores
on preoperative IPSS scores (P o 0.001) (Table 1).
Histopathologic characteristics were similar between the
2 cohorts with the exception of lower prostate weight in
younger patients (41.0 � 10.5 vs. 52.8 � 20.5, P o 0.001)

 (Table 2). Specifically, patients in the younger cohort had
similar Gleason scores after pathologic evaluation. Similar
proportion of patients had an upgrade in Gleason score after
pathologic examination of prostatectomy tissue (37.0% in
younger and 35.9% in older patients, P ¼ 0.45). Rates of
PSMs and extraprostatic disease were similar between the 2
cohorts (Table 2). A substantial number of younger patients
had adverse pathologic features, including 20.6% with
locally advanced disease, 65.7% with pathologic Gleason
score Z 7, and 5.5% with pathologic Gleason score Z8,
and these features were similar to older group of patients.
Biochemical disease-free survival was also similar at 1 and
3 years (P ¼ 0.39). There were no differences between the
groups in any pathologic variable, including PSA, Gleason
score, pathologic staging, and biochemical disease-free
survival at short follow-up.
Bilateral nerve preservation was performed in a similar
percentage of patients in both cohorts (92% vs. 89%,
P ¼ 0.18). Patients in the younger cohort recovered potency
faster than their older counterparts (Fig. 1). At each
postsurgical follow-up date, from 6 weeks to 12 months,
more preoperatively potent younger men had recovered
potency than their older counterparts (P o 0.05). At 12
months postoperatively, 221 of 238 (92.8%) preoperatively
potent patients r50-year old had recovered potency, com-
pared with 1,365 of 1,645 (82.9%) older patients (P o 0.01).
When potency was stratified by age in 5-year increments,
there was a progressive decrement in potency with increasing
age. In multivariable analysis, nerve-sparing status, comor-
bidity (as defined by ASA scores), and age dichotomized at
50 years were independent predictors of recovery of potency.
The rate of continence recovery did not differ between the
2 cohorts at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 12 months after surgery;
however, younger patients gained urinary continence faster
than elder counterparts as evident by the difference at
6-month follow-up (Fig. 2).
Further analyses were performed using propensity score
matching. Figure 3 shows the change in the absolute
standard difference after matching process. In matching
process, 1,348 matches were found for 229 men r50 years.
In the matched dataset of patients, the difference in recovery
of erectile function and urinary continent was still signifi-
cant (Figs. 4 and 5). Younger patients recovered urinary
continence faster than older counterparts and had faster and
better recovery in erectile function in terms of potency.
However,
at
6-month
follow-up
data,
the
difference
in
potency
recovery
was
not
statistically
significant
(P = 0.17). Biochemical recurrence rate was not different
in the matched dataset as well (P = 0.19).
4. Discussion
In this study, 271 young men (r50 years) were studied.
Young patients constituted 10.8% of our patients. In the
report of an Australian study [17], only 2.6% of primary
patient population were younger than 50 years, similarly a
study in Germany [10] on 13,268 men diagnosed with
prostate cancer, only 3.3% of men were younger than 50
years. Our data represents that 10.8% patients are younger
than 50 years which is higher rate than the previously
reported studies. Australian [17] and German [10] studies
showed lower grade tumor in younger population. Results
of the pathological features of prostate cancer in our dataset
of young patients were different. Our study revealed same
histopathologic characteristics as older men. Our data could
not show a lower-risk classification or lower-stage disease

 in young patients. The findings of our study are in line with
previous studies [18] indicating more aggressive pattern of
prostate cancer in younger population [19]. Difference
might arise from the referral setting of the study population.
However, the German study reported a tertiary care center
experience as well. A higher proportion of young patients in
our cohort might also be the result of patient-requested
check of PSA. The incidence of prostate cancer has changed
over the time in different age groups based on the use of
PSA as a screening tool [20]. After recommendation of
United States Preventive Task Force against the use of PSA
as a screening measure in men, regardless of age, a decrease
in incidence of prostate cancer is observed [20].
A possible explanation to the different pathologic find-
ings in this study could arise from different races of patients
in Europe and Australia. African American patients, con-
stituting 21.4% of younger cohort, are known to have more
aggressive tumors at younger ages relative to other races
[21]. Studies have shown than African American men had a
decreased likelihood of definitive treatment in epidemio-
logical analyses [22]. Considering the higher incidence and
more aggressive tumors in African American patients,
should the African American population require a separate
screening program for prostate cancer has been discussed in
the literature [23].
Previously, the American Urological Association rec-
ommended lowering its screening threshold from 50 to 40
years [24]. PSA is more specific test for younger men as
there is less confounding from benign prostatic enlarge-
ment, a well-described age-related phenomenon [25]. PSA
value, even in the normal range (o2.5 ng/ml), has been
shown to work as a predictive tool for men in their 40s.
Men in their 40s with a baseline PSA above the
age-specific median (0.6–0.7 ng/ml) are at increased risk
of subsequently being diagnosed with prostate cancer [26].
Obtaining
a
baseline
PSA
level
also
enables
the
calculation of PSA velocity in the future, which has
been demonstrated to be predictive of prostate cancer
outcomes [27].
Screening strategy in young population would lead to an
increase in the diagnosis of prostate cancer, both clinically
significant and insignificant, in young men. It is thus
important
to
understand
their
likely
oncologic
and
functional outcomes following definitive therapy. Although
many would be diagnosed at a low-grade and stage,
a significant proportion of these younger men would

 have aggressive disease. Of our cohort of 271 patients aged
r50 years, 20.6% had locally advanced disease and 71.2%
had Gleason score 7 or higher in their prostatectomy
specimen. These outcomes were similar to those of older
men, with the expected exception of a lower prostate weight
in younger patients. The pathologic data in our younger
cohort were consistent with other reports in the PSA era,
which have shown equivalent pathologic outcomes in younger
patients [18].
A large number of patients (2,255/2,495) in our cohort
underwent nerve-sparing surgery. This is in contrast to the
previous studies where low proportion of patients are
reported for nerve-sparing surgery; younger patients were
more likely to undergo nerve-sparing surgery in previous
studies [10]. However, rates of nerve sparing in our cohort
was higher and similar in both young and elderly popula-
tion, 93.7% vs. 77.4% and 89.9% vs. 61.5% in young and
elderly population, respectively.

 Age has been found to be an independent predictor of
long-term potency outcomes [28]; high proportion of
patients r50 years have been shown to recover erectile
function [12]. However, the rate of return of erectile
function has not been studied in such a cohort. Our data
could show that young patients gain potency in a shorter
time following surgery compared with elderly patients. The
findings of primary analyses were also obtained after
incorporating a propensity score matching process. How-
ever, the overall return of erectile function was reduced in
matched dataset. Age has also been identified as an
independent risk factor for biochemical recurrence [29].
However, time of follow-up data limits our interpretation of
biochemical recurrence analyses.
This information is valuable not only for younger men
who are deciding among treatment alternatives following
the diagnosis of prostate cancer, but also for those debating
PSA screening. If men are aware that they have a high
likelihood of maintaining continence and erectile function
after definitive treatment, they may be less reluctant to
undergo screening. Men at age 47, the mean age of our
younger cohort, have an actuarial life expectancy of 31
years; men in the healthiest quartile can expect to live 50%
longer than that [30]. Although an earlier initiation of
screening likely adds to the already substantial lead-time
bias of prostate cancer, men diagnosed at an early age with
Gleason score 7 cancer would likely have developed
clinically significant disease within their lifetime and
probably benefited from definitive treatment [31]. It remains
unknown whether delaying the diagnosis in these men until
after age 50 years would have changed their long-term
outcomes.
This long life expectancy also means that patients have a
longer time to deal with the potential adverse effects of
prostate cancer treatment on their quality of life. Patients
rendered incontinent or impotent would have to live with
these consequences for several decades. As advanced age
has been associated with worse and slower recovery of
continence and potency following prostatectomy [32], it is
logical to assume that younger age would be associated
with improved functional outcomes. Our findings reflected
this with regard to erectile function. Our younger cohort
was healthier and had better preoperative erectile function
than the older patients. This could contribute to the faster
recovery of erectile function in the younger cohort [11,28],
with higher proportions of younger patients achieving
potency at all time points of follow-up. However, using a
propensity
matching
analyses
considering
race,
ASA,
D'Amico risk group, and preoperative continence and
potency status, the difference in regaining urinary con-
tinence and erectile function after surgery remained statisti-
cally significant. However, rates of urinary continence were
similar between the 2 groups except at 6 months, in both
sets of analyses. The significant difference in gaining
potency at 6-moth follow-up was lost in matched dataset.
Our functional results were consistent with previous reports,
which also demonstrated improved erectile function but
equivalent
continence
among
the
younger
patients
[10,12,18,22,33]. Long-term erectile outcomes of men
undergoing prostatectomy who regain their erections are
still to be studied. Erectile dysfunction develops in men as
they age, and it is unclear whether prior prostatectomy
accelerates this decline [34].
4.1. Limitations
These results must be tempered by the inherent biases of
our study design. It is also difficult to place an objective
value measurement on outcomes that can be viewed differ-
ently and subjectively depending on age. Although the
functional outcomes of young men seem better than their
older counterparts, the decrement in function that they do
suffer may represent a more severe disruption, and therefore
a more important loss, than a greater degree of dysfunction
in an older patient. Our older cohort is also heterogeneous
owing to the age range within it (age: 51–78 y), and
functional outcomes of the group were depressed in the
more elderly men. We tried to perform a propensity score
matching process to reduce the bias resulting from demo-
graphic and preoperative characteristics. Data on volume of
the tumors in patients or results of imaging, that is,
magnetic resonance imaging, were not available uniformly
for all patients. We could not provide detailed pathologic
data specifically on patients with Gleason score 6 under-
going RALP. Moreover, functional outcome stratification
by race was not feasible according to the available data.
Reflecting prior screening guidelines, our younger cohort
contained a higher proportion of African Americans and
those with a family history of prostate cancer, and it is
unclear how this may have affected our pathologic results.
Despite the large size of our database, it is largely referral
based. As such, one cannot draw epidemiologic conclusions
from our data. We do not know the true denominator of
patients diagnosed with prostate cancer in our catchment
area. It is also possible that younger patients with more
advanced disease were referred for surgery, whereas others
with very low-risk disease were put on active surveillance
protocols. Similarly, it is possible that older patients with
higher-risk disease were referred for radiotherapy.
Additionally, while the number of study participants is
quite large, the actual number of patients r50-year-old is
relatively small. This is likely a reflection of the lower
prevalence of prostate cancer among such patients in the
overall population. However, future studies involving larger
numbers of these younger patients for comparison would be
insightful and relevant in the context of our findings.
5. Conclusions
In a large, single-surgeon cohort, men aged r50 years
undergoing RALP had similar pathologic outcomes as older

 men, with high rates of advanced grade and stage. Although
the rates of continence among the 2 age groups remained
similarly high postoperatively, the younger men recovered
erectile function faster than their older counterparts, perhaps
owing to improved overall health and baseline function.
Given our relatively low number of younger patients, future
studies among larger groups are necessary.
