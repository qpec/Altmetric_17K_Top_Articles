Abstract
Background: Almonds may increase circulating HDL cholesterol when substituted for a high-carbohydrate snack in an
isocaloric diet, yet little is known about the effects on HDL biology and function.
Objective: The objective was to determine whether incorporating 43 g almonds/d in a cholesterol-lowering diet would
improve HDL subspecies and function, which were secondary study outcomes.
Methods: In a randomized, 2-period, crossover, controlled-feeding study, a diet with 43 g almonds/d (percentage of total
energy: 51% carbohydrate, 16% protein, and 32% total and 8% saturated fat) was compared with a similar diet with an
isocaloric muffin substitution (58% carbohydrate, 15% protein, and 26% total and 8% saturated fat) in men and women
with elevated LDL cholesterol. Plasma HDL subspecies and cholesterol efflux from J774 macrophages to human serum
were measured at baseline and after each diet period. Diet effects were examined in all participants (n = 48) and in normal-
weight (body mass index: <25; n = 14) and overweight or obese ($25; n = 34) participants by using linear mixed models.
Results: The almond diet, compared with the control diet, increased a-1 HDL [mean 6 SEM: 26.7 6 1.5 compared with
24.3 6 1.3 mg apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I)/dL; P = 0.001]. In normal-weight participants, the almond diet, relative to the
control diet, increased a-1 HDL (33.7 6 3.2 compared with 28.4 6 2.6 mg apoA-I/dL), the a-1 to pre–b-1 ratio [geometric
mean (95% CI): 4.3 (3.3, 5.7) compared with 3.1 (2.4, 4.0)], and non–ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 cholesterol efflux
(8.3% 6 0.4% compared with 7.8% 6 0.3%) and decreased pre–b-2 (3.8 6 0.4 compared with 4.6 6 0.4 mg apoA-I/dL)
and a-3 (23.5 6 0.9 compared with 26.9 6 1.1 mg apoA-I/dL) HDL (P < 0.05). No diet effects were observed in the
overweight or obese group.
Conclusions: Substituting almonds for a carbohydrate-rich snack within a lower-saturated-fat diet may be a simple
strategy to maintain a favorable circulating HDL subpopulation distribution and improve cholesterol efflux in normal-weight
individuals with elevated LDL cholesterol. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01101230.

Introduction
Contemporary dietary guidance includes food-based dietary
pattern guidelines together with recommendations to decrease
saturated fat, sodium, and added sugar (1, 2). Reduced saturated
fat intake has been associated with a decreased risk of cardio-
vascular events (3). In addition, reducing dietary saturated fat
decreases cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, including
total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol (2). This dietary change
also results in lower HDL-cholesterol concentrations (4). Op-
timal macronutrient distribution remains controversial, espe-
cially concerning the replacement of saturated fat (5, 6). Evidence
from the OmniHeart Trial, a randomized, controlled-feeding
intervention comparing carbohydrate (58% carbohydrate,
15% protein, and 21% MUFAs and PUFAs), protein (48%
carbohydrate, 25% protein, and 21% MUFAs and PUFAs), and
unsaturated-fat (48% carbohydrate, 15% protein, and 31%
MUFAs and PUFAs) diets matched for saturated fat (6%),
showed that the unsaturated-fat diet prevented decreases in
HDL cholesterol compared with the carbohydrate and protein
diets, whereas all 3 diets elicited the same LDL-cholesterol-
lowering effect (7).
We previously showed that a cholesterol-lowering diet with
almonds (43 g/d) improves HDL cholesterol (51 6 2 compared
with 49 6 2 mg/dL; P < 0.01) compared with a similar diet
containing a high-carbohydrate snack isocalorically substituted
for almonds (8). The almond diet, relative to the control diet,

 also increased HDL2 and HDL3, HDL subfractions deter-
mined by ultracentrifugation (HDL2: 11.3 6 0.7 compared with
10.6 6 0.6 mg/dL; P = 0.02; HDL3: 38.8 6 1.3 compared with
37.4 6 1.1 mg/dL; P = 0.01) (8).
Current evidence suggests that the cardioprotective effects
of HDL may be more dependent on subpopulation distribution
and function than on absolute HDL-cholesterol concentrations
(9, 10). Therefore, on the basis of this and our preliminary
findings, we hypothesized that incorporating 43 g almonds/d
in a cholesterol-lowering diet would improve HDL function
(i.e., cholesterol efflux to apoB-depleted serum) and HDL sub-
species compared with a traditional cholesterol-lowering, lower-
fat diet. We also sought to evaluate the effects of weight status
and body composition on HDL function in response to the treat-
ment and control diets because adiposity has been shown to affect
HDL cholesterol (11).
Methods
Subjects. Stored samples from a previous study (8) were used for the
current analysis. Detailed methods and participant characteristics were
described previously (8). Briefly, men and women (ages 30–65 y) with a BMI
(in kg/m2) of 20–35 and LDL cholesterol $121–190 mg/dL for women and
128–194 mg/dL for men (50th–95th percentile based on NHANES 1999–
2000) were eligible for the study. Exclusion criteria included the
following: tobacco use; alcohol consumption of $14 drinks/wk
(i.e., $196 g ethanol/wk); chronic illness; refusal to stop vitamin or
mineral, lipid-lowering, or other supplements; use of prescription
cholesterol-lowering medications; vegetarian diet; weight gain or loss of
$10% within the previous 6 mo; and pregnant, lactating, or wanting to
become pregnant before or during the study. Each participant signed a
written informed consent to participate. The study protocol was approved
by the Institutional Review Board of The Pennsylvania State University.
This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01101230.
Intervention. A randomized, crossover, 2-period (6 wk/period),
controlled-feeding study (October 2009 to February 2012) was conducted
to investigate the effects of almonds (43 g/d) within the context of a
cholesterol-lowering diet on cardiometabolic risk factors. The almond
and control diets were identical with the exception of the snack that was
provided: 42.5 g (1.5 ounces) unsalted, whole, natural almonds with
skins (253 kcal/d) or 106 g banana muffin + 2.7 g butter (273 kcal/d),
respectively. All of the meals and snacks were provided to partic-
ipants. The nutrient compositions of both the almond diet (percentage
of total energy: 51% carbohydrate, 16% protein, and 32% total and
8% saturated fat) and the control diet (percentage of total energy:
58% carbohydrate, 15% protein, and 26% total and 8% saturated fat)
were reported previously (8). At the beginning of the study (baseline) and
at the end of each diet period, on 2 consecutive days participants
underwent a series of clinical and physical assessments. On test
mornings, participants arrived in the fasting state (12 h with only water,
48 h without alcohol, and 12 h without vigorous exercise) to the General
Clinical Research Center. Trained research staff measured their height,
weight, and body composition and obtained a fasting blood sample
(;30 mL on each day). Whole blood was drawn into either serum
separator tubes and allowed to clot or into EDTA-containing tubes.
Blood was centrifuged at 1500 3 g and 4�C for 15 min, and aliquots of
serum and plasma were stored in a 280�C freezer and not thawed until
further analyses were conducted.
Serum lipids, lipoproteins, and apolipoproteins. Serum lipids,
lipoproteins, and apolipoproteins were measured by both standard
enzymatic and spectrophotometric methods and the vertical auto profile
technique described previously (8).
Plasma HDL subpopulations. Plasma apoA-I–containing HDL sub-
populations were determined by 2-dimensional (nondenaturing agarose-
polyacrylamide) gel electrophoresis, immunoblotting, and image analysis
(Boston Heart Diagnostics) as described (12, 13).
Cholesterol efflux to serum. Cholesterol efflux was determined by
using J774 macrophages (Vascular Strategies LLC) as previously
described (14). Macrophages were labeled with
3H cholesterol for
24 h and allowed to equilibrate overnight with or without cAMP for the
assessment of global cholesterol efflux and ATP-binding cassette
transporter (ABC) A1 efflux, respectively. Polyethylene glycol was used
to precipitate apoB-containing lipoproteins from serum samples to
isolate the HDL fraction as previously described (15). The efflux
acceptor medium (i.e., apoB-depleted serum) contained HDL in the
supernatant at a concentration of 2.8% vol:vol. Acceptor medium for
assay controls contained 20 mg human apoA-I (lipid-free) or 2% human
serum/mL. Acceptor media was added to cells for 4 h; medium and cell
monolayers were analyzed to determine the percentage of cholesterol
released from cells. Results from multiple assays were normalized by
using the human serum control in each assay.
Body-composition distribution. Body composition was measured by
using DXA (QDR-4500W; Hologic Corp) as previously described (8).
Statistical analysis. Statistical analyses were performed by using SAS
(version 9.3; SAS Institute). One-factor ANOVA was used to determine
significant differences between pre- and postmenopausal women and
men at baseline. Normality was assessed by using univariate analysis to
quantitatively evaluate skewness and to visually inspect box and
probability plots. Treatment effects were tested per protocol (partic-
ipants completing the entire study were included in the analysis) and
with the use of a linear mixed model, with treatment, visit (first or
second), and their interaction as fixed effects and subject as a random
effect. In addition, a linear mixed model was used for subgroup
analyses to investigate whether participant baseline characteristics
(i.e., BMI or sex) modified the effects of treatment on outcome
variables. Baseline characteristics were stratified into categories on the
basis of established cutoffs (i.e., BMI <25 or $25). For this secondary
analysis, treatment, visit (first or second), group (BMI or sex),
treatment-by-visit, and treatment-by-group were considered as fixed
effects and subject as the random effect. The Bonferroni correction was
used to adjust for multiple comparisons. Pearson correlations were
used to evaluate associations between both baseline variables and
change values for each diet period. Significance was set at P < 0.05. A
sample size of 45 was determined on the basis of earlier studies (16, 17),
which detected significant changes in LDL cholesterol, our primary
outcome, and abdominal adiposity, a secondary outcome, with an a set
to 0.05 and power set to 0.90.
Results
As previously reported (8), participants (n = 48; 26 women,
22 men) were middle-aged (50 6 9 y) and overweight (BMI:
26 6 3) with elevated LDL cholesterol (149 6 20 mg/dL) and
normal HDL cholesterol (55 6 16 mg/dL). Baseline measures

 of apoA-I–containing HDL subpopulations and global and
transporter-specific cholesterol efflux in pre- and postmeno-
pausal women and men are presented in Table 1.
There were no baseline differences between pre- and postmen-
opausal women; thus, all women were combined for analyses. Men
had significantly less a-1 HDL and cholesterol efflux from non-
ABCA1 transporters than did pre- and postmenopausal women.
Men also had reduced a-2 HDL compared with postmenopau-
sal women. Despite these differences at baseline, no significant
interactions of treatment by sex were observed (data not shown).
Baseline correlations. Correlations for baseline measures of
HDL cholesterol, apoA-I, HDL subspecies, cholesterol efflux,
BMI, abdominal fat, and leg fat are presented in Table 2 and
Figure 1. HDL cholesterol and apoA-I were highly correlated
(P < 0.0001) and similarly associated with pre–b-2 HDL, a-1
HDL, a-2 HDL, global cholesterol efflux, and non-ABCA1
cholesterol efflux (P < 0.05 for all). HDL subspecies a-1 and
a-2 were also highly correlated (P < 0.0001), and both were
associated with global efflux and non-ABCA1 efflux (P < 0.01
for all). BMI was inversely correlated with HDL cholesterol,
apoA-I, a-1 HDL, a-2 HDL, global efflux, and non-ABCA1
efflux (P < 0.05 for all). In addition, abdominal fat was
inversely associated with a-1 HDL (P < 0.05) and leg fat was
positively associated with HDL cholesterol, apoA-I, and a-1
HDL (P < 0.05 for all). Correlations for outcome changes from
baseline for each treatment period are presented in Supple-
mental Tables 1 and 2.
apoA-I-containing HDL subspecies. The almond diet im-
proved a-1 HDL compared with the control diet (Table 3).
There was a treatment-by-visit interaction (P = 0.04) for the a-1
to pre–b-1 ratio, with a significant post hoc difference between
the almond and control diets at diet period 2 [geometric mean
(95% CI): 3.7 (3.1, 4.4) compared with 2.5 (2.0, 3.1); P = 0.04].
There were no treatment effects for the remaining apoA-I–
containing HDL subspecies.
Cholesterol efflux. There were no treatment effects for global
or transporter-specific cholesterol efflux to apoB-depleted serum
(Table 3).
Diet comparisons in normal-weight and overweight or
obese participants. There were no treatment differences for
total body weight or BMI (data not shown). Subgroup analysis
showed that baseline BMI (<25 compared with $25) influences
HDL cholesterol, pre–b-2 HDL, a-1 HDL, a-3 HDL, pre–a-1
HDL, pre–a-2 HDL, the a-1 to pre–b-1 ratio, and non-ABCA1
cholesterol efflux responses to diet (treatment-by-baseline BMI
group interaction; Table 4). In normal-weight participants
(BMI: 24 6 1; range: 22–25; n = 14), the almond diet improved
HDL cholesterol, a-1 HDL, the a-1 to pre–b-1 ratio, and
cholesterol efflux via non-ABCA1 transporters compared with
the control diet. In addition, the almond diet decreased pre–b-2
and a-3 HDL compared with the control diet in normal-weight
individuals. Overweight and obese participants (BMI: 28 6 2;
range: 25–33; n = 34) did not experience any within-group

 effects of the almond diet on HDL subspecies or cholesterol
efflux outcomes.
Furthermore, BMI group comparisons showed that HDL
cholesterol, a-1 HDL, the a-1 to pre–b-1 ratio, and cholesterol
efflux via non-ABCA1 transporters were greater after almond
consumption in the normal-weight group than after both the
control and almond diets in the overweight or obese group
(Table 4).
Discussion
This is the first study, to our knowledge, to evaluate the effects of
almond consumption on HDL subspecies and HDL function as
assessed by global and transporter-specific cholesterol efflux. We
found that including almonds in a cholesterol-lowering diet
(moderate in total fat due to the almonds; percentage of total
energy: 32% total and 8% saturated fat, 16% protein, and 51%
carbohydrate) prevented decreases in a-1 HDL that are observed
with a traditional lower-fat diet (26% total and 8% saturated
fat, 15% protein, and 58% carbohydrate). A previous study (18)
in male participants showed that a-1 HDL was a better predictor
of ischemic heart disease (IHD) than total HDL cholesterol. In
this same cohort, each 1-mg apoA-I increase/dL in a-1 HDL was
associated with a 26% decrease in the odds of IHD, whereas
each 1-mg apoA-I increase/dL in a-3 HDL was associated with
an 18% increase in the odds of IHD (18). Furthermore, in the
current study, an overall improvement in the subpopulation
profile was evidenced by the preservation of the a-1 to pre–b-1
ratio with almond consumption. Low concentrations of a-1
HDL and high concentrations of pre–b-1 HDL, individually or
in combination, have been shown to increase CVD risk (18, 19).
The a-1 to pre–b-1 ratio allows a proportional comparison of
antiatherogenic a-1 HDL to immature, proatherogenic pre–b-1
HDL, providing additional information about HDL maturation
and CVD risk.
The PREDIMED (Prevenci´
on con Dieta Mediterr´
anea) trial
found a reduction of ;30% in major cardiovascular events in
individuals who consumed a Mediterranean diet (MedDiet)
supplemented with either 30 g nuts/d (walnuts, almonds, and
hazelnuts) or 50 g (1 L � wk21 � family21) extra-virgin olive oil/d
compared with individuals who were given advice to decrease
their dietary fat intake (20). However, contrary to our findings,
the PREDIMED trial found no changes in large, medium, or
small HDL particle number, as measured by NMR spectroscopy,
with the MedDiet supplemented with nuts compared with the
MedDiet with olive oil or with the lower-fat control diet (21).
This discrepancy could be due to differences in measurement
technique, dietary intervention (both treatment and control diets

 effects in the overweight or obese group; however, lean indi-
viduals had pronounced effects, including significantly higher
a-1 HDL– and a-1–to–pre–b-1 ratios and lower pre–b-2 and
a-3 HDL concentrations with the almond diet, relative to the
control diet.
In the current study, we saw no treatment effects on global
or transporter-specific cholesterol efflux; however, with both
diets there were decreases in global, ABCA1, and non-ABCA1
efflux compared with baseline. Conversely, results from a pre-
vious study in our laboratory showed a 3.3% increase in
postprandial (4 h) cholesterol efflux relative to fasting baseline
after consumption of whole walnuts (85 g) (22). Inherent study
design differences preclude direct comparison between studies
but emphasize distinctions that may account for discrepancies
in the literature. For example, our study on walnut consump-
tion (22) was an acute-feeding exposure, measuring postpran-
dial cholesterol efflux to whole serum and including all efflux
pathways, whereas in the current study, we investigated the
effects of chronic almond intake on fasting cholesterol efflux
to apoB-depleted serum (HDL fraction) via global, ABCA1-
mediated, and non-ABCA1–mediated routes.
Several comparable dietary interventions (23–25) also
reported no treatment effects of a MUFA-rich diet on choles-
terol efflux capacity when compared with carbohydrate (23),
saturated fat (24), or linoleic acid (18:2n–6) (25)–rich diets,
despite a reduction in both atherogenic lipoproteins (23, 24)
and HDL oxidative modification (25) with the MUFA-rich
diets. Blanco-Molina et al. (23) conducted a study investigating
the effects of a National Cholesterol Education Program
(NCEP) step 1 diet (28% total fat, 9% saturated fat, 14%
MUFAs, 5% PUFAs, and 0.027 mg cholesterol/kJ) compared
with a MUFA diet (39% total fat, 9% saturated fat, 25%
MUFAs, 5% PUFAs, and 0.027 mg cholesterol/kJ) with or
without added cholesterol (0.068 mg cholesterol/kJ) on cho-
lesterol efflux to whole serum from rat hepatoma cells. Their
results showed a benefit of the MUFA-rich diet on apoB, the
total-cholesterol to HDL-cholesterol ratio, and the apoB to
apoA-I ratio compared with the NCEP step 1 diet; however,
the MUFA-rich diet had no effect on cholesterol efflux (23).
Moreover, this group did observe an increase in cholesterol
efflux with the consumption of the high-cholesterol NCEP step
1 diet compared with the low-cholesterol NCEP step 1 diet,
suggesting that dietary cholesterol intake may have a regula-
tory effect on cholesterol efflux (23). This finding has been
corroborated in a study in mice, which showed that a high-fat,
high-cholesterol diet increases cholesterol efflux from macro-
phages compared with both a high-fat, low-cholesterol diet
and a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet; increases in the expression
of liver ABCG5 and ABCG8 with the high-fat, high-cholesterol
diet may explain a mechanism by which dietary cholesterol
influences efflux capacity (26). Therefore, in the current study,
decreases in overall cholesterol efflux may be due to the low
cholesterol content of the study diets.
Furthermore, we were interested to find a treatment effect
on non-ABCA1 cholesterol efflux when participants were strat-
ified by BMI, similar to previous findings that lean individuals
respond more sensitively to dietary interventions aimed at
lowering LDL cholesterol (27, 28). In normal-weight individ-
uals, the almond diet prevented decreases in non-ABCA1 efflux
that occurred with consumption of the control diet. Global
efflux to apoB-depleted serum encompasses cholesterol efflux
via passive diffusion, secretion of sterol 27-hydroxylase metab-
olites, the ABC transporters, particularly ABCA1 and ABCG1,
and scavenger receptor class B type 1 (SR-B1) (29–31). ABCA1
efflux quantifies cholesterol removed by the ABCA1 trans-
porter, and non-ABCA1 (global efflux minus ABCA1 choles-
terol efflux) represents all of the aforementioned pathways
except for the ABCA1 transporter. In the current study, baseline
ABCA1 efflux was associated with lipid-poor pre–b-1, which
has been shown previously in healthy men (15), whereas
baseline non-ABCA1 efflux was associated with HDL choles-
terol, apoA-I, pre–b-2 HDL, a-1 HDL, and a-2 HDL. In
addition, changes in non-ABCA1 efflux were positively asso-
ciated with changes in HDL cholesterol, apoA-I, pre–b-1 HDL,
a-1 HDL, and a-2 HDL.
Absolute concentrations of HDL cholesterol are associated
with a decreased risk of CVD in observational studies, and
strategies to increase HDL cholesterol have been explored as a
way to decrease CVD risk (32). However, current pharmaco-
logic interventions with niacin and cholesteryl ester transfer
protein inhibitors have not shown a benefit on CVD events or
mortality, despite an increase in HDL-cholesterol concentrations
(33, 34). Therefore, it is important to quantify functional and
biological characteristics of HDL, in addition to measuring
HDL-cholesterol and apoA-I concentrations.
A potential limitation of the current study, and all studies
evaluating HDL biology and function, is a lack of method
standardization across trials. HDL subclasses can be mea-
sured by a variety of methods, including ultracentrifugation,
NMR spectrometry, and 1-dimensional gel electrophoresis.
The method we chose uses 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis,
which separates HDL subclasses by size and charge and then
quantifies apoA-I in each subparticle, providing the most
comprehensive measure of HDL subspecies distribution. In
addition, cholesterol efflux methods can vary by cell line, use
of whole serum or the HDL fraction, and global or transporter-
specific outcomes. Furthermore, the sample size for this cohort
was determined on the basis of the primary outcome measures,
LDL cholesterol and abdominal adiposity (8); therefore,
power to detect differences in secondary outcomes by BMI
group may be limited. Post hoc power analyses, with the use of
sample size and SDs from the current analysis, indicated that
differences of 8–28% and 3–13% were detectable for HDL
subspecies in the normal-weight and overweight or obese
groups, respectively, whereas, differences of 7–23% and 3–
15% were detectable for cholesterol efflux outcomes in the
normal-weight and overweight or obese groups, respectively.
Strengths of the current study include the controlled die-
tary intervention and novel HDL subpopulation and function
measures.
In conclusion, incorporating almonds in a lower-saturated-
fat diet improves HDL subspecies, specifically by preventing
decreases in a-1 HDL caused by a traditional low-fat diet.
Furthermore, almond consumption improves HDL subpopula-
tion distribution and non-ABCA1–mediated cholesterol efflux,
relative to the control diet, in normal-weight participants.
Therefore, substituting almonds for a carbohydrate-rich snack
within a lower-saturated-fat diet maintains favorable circulating
HDL subpopulation distribution and function in normal-weight
individuals with elevated LDL cholesterol.
