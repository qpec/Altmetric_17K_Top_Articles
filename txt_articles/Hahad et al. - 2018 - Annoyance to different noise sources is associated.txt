Background: Annoyance is a common reaction in populations exposed to environmental noise and is associated
with cardiovascular diseases. We investigated for the first time the existence of an association between noise an-
noyance and atrial fibrillation (AF).
Methods and results: Cross-sectional data from 14,639 participants of the Gutenberg Health Study were collected
between 2007 and 2012. Annoyance from road traffic, aircraft, railways, industrial/construction and neighbourhood
noise during daytime and sleep were collected from all participants through questionnaires using a 5-point scale. AF
was assessed via self-reported medical history and/or documentation of AF on the study electrocardiogram. 80% of
the study participants were annoyed by noise to a certain degree. The major sources of annoyance during daytime
and sleep were aircraft, road traffic and neighbourhood noise. We found significant associations between annoy-
ance (per point increase) and AF for aircraft noise annoyance during daytime (odds ratio (OR) 1.04; 95% confidence
interval (CI) 1.00–1.08) and during sleep (OR 1.09; 95% CI 1.05–1.13), road traffic noise annoyance during sleep (OR
1.15; 95% CI 1.08–1.22), neighbourhood noise annoyance during daytime (OR 1.14; 95% CI 1.09–1.20) and during
sleep (OR 1.14; 95% CI 1.07–1.21), industrial noise annoyance during daytime (OR 1.11; 95% CI 1.04–1.18) and rail-
way noise annoyance during sleep (OR 1.13; 95% CI 1.04–1.22). Different degrees of annoyance were not associated
with changes in cardiovascular risk factors.
Discussion: The results suggest for the first time that noise annoyance is associated with AF. Further studies are war-
ranted to gain insight in the mechanisms underlying the noise-annoyance-disease relationship.

1. Introduction
The key message of the World Health Organization (WHO) report on
the global assessment of the burden of disease from environmental risks
is that “an estimated 12.6 million deaths each year are attributable to
unhealthy environments, which mean that 23% of all global deaths are
linked to the environment” [1]. Like other forms of pollution, environ-
mental noise exposure belongs to environmental hazards and has an
important role in their relationship with adverse health outcomes [2].
The WHO estimates that in Western European countries each year
nearly 1 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) are lost due to
noise exposure, while noise-induced annoyance accounts for 587,000
DALYs [3].
The noise and stress-reaction model proposed by Babisch describes
two general pathways that may result in adverse health effects [4].
The direct pathway is characterised by the direct subcortical interaction
between the central auditory system and other regions of the central
nervous system in response to very high sound levels. The indirect/
non-auditory pathway is mediated by the cognitive elaboration of the
sound, followed by cortical activation resulting in emotional responses
such as annoyance [5]. In this pathway, the negative perception of the
sound acts as psychosocial stressor and activates self-regulatory mech-
anisms including the sympathetic and neuroendocrine system. The sub-
sequent increases in blood pressure and heart rate, glucose and lipid
levels and blood viscosity are some examples of the implications of
this pathway [4]. In sum, noise acts at both with the cortical and

 subcortical level to induce cardiovascular diseases (CVD) [6,7]. Simi-
larly, chronic stress per se has been shown to be associated with an in-
creased risk of CVD [8,9].
Accordingly, annoyance was linked with an increase in risk of CVD
[5,10,11], in particular arterial hypertension and ischemic heart disease.
Also, we have previously shown noise annoyance to be strongly associ-
ated with depression and anxiety [12]. Since annoyance reflects emo-
tional stress, an important risk factor for the development of AF [13],
the aim of the present study was to examine the relationship between
noise annoyance and AF in the population-based Gutenberg Health
study (GHS) [14].
2. Methods
2.1. Study population
The study population included 15,010 participants of the GHS enrolled in the period
from 2007 to 2012 at the University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg-
University Mainz, Germany. The rationale and design of the GHS have been published pre-
viously [14]. Briefly, the GHS is a population-based, single-center cohort study with an age
range of 35 to 74 years and a proportion of 49% women. The aim of the GHS is to obtain
extensive knowledge about etiology, pathogenesis and risk factors of common diseases.
The study population includes the city of Mainz and the district of Mainz-Bingen. The ran-
dom sample is stratified in equal strata for sex, residence and decades of age, study proto-
col and documents are approved by the local ethics committee of the Medical Chamber of
Rhineland-Palatinate and the local data safety commissioner. Participants are included
after informed consent, insufficient knowledge of German language, psychological or
physical impairment with regard to participation are the only exclusion criteria. All
study investigations are conducted in line with the Declaration of Helsinki and principles
outlined in recommendations for Good Clinical Practice and Good Epidemiological Prac-
tice. Participants of the GHS undergo a 5-hour standardized baseline examination and
comprehensive deep clinical phenotyping including collection of data on lifestyle informa-
tion, exposure to environmental factors, psychosocial situation, cardiovascular risk factors
(CVRFs), laboratory-chemical parameters and clinical data. All operations are performed
by trained professionals and in accordance with standard operating procedures. The re-
sponse to invitation is 60.3%. For the purposes of the present analyses, participants who
did not provide complete information about exposure to noise were excluded.
2.2. Data assessment
2.2.1. Annoyance
The main exposure variable was noise annoyance as measured by questions in ac-
cordance with Felscher-Suhr, Guski and Schluemer [15]. On a 5-point scale from “not”
to “extremely” participants were asked to rate “how annoyed have you been in the
past years by …?” Here, noise annoyance resulting from road traffic, aircraft, railways,
industrial/construction and neighbourhood were assessed “during the day” and “in
your sleep”.
2.3. Outcome
We defined AF as either previous diagnosis of AF and/or documentation of AF on the
study electrocardiogram (ECG). History of AF was self-reported. Cardiac rhythm analysis
was performed automatically (GE Healthcare, CardioSoft v6) and confirmed by at least
two cardiologists. ECG-based diagnosis of AF was defined as absolutely irregular R peak in-
tervals and an absence of P waves. Further methodological details have been described
elsewhere [16].
2.4. Potential confounders
Selections of confounders were done a priori. Socioeconomic status (SES) was mea-
sured in accordance with Lampert and Kroll (score range 3 to 21 with higher values indi-
cating higher SES), which combines information about educational background, current
occupation and income [17]. Night shift work was considered as current or noncurrent.
Depressive disorder was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). The
questionnaire contains 9 questions (score range 0–27 with higher values indicating in-
creased depressive symptom severity), which are based on diagnostic criteria of major de-
pression from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. The caseness for
depression was based on a PHQ-9 score of ≥10 [18]. Personal medication history was de-
rived from baseline-screening and drug packaging. Diabetes mellitus was defined as
self-reported history of diabetes, corresponding medical therapy, or fasting blood glucose
≥126 mg/dL or non-fasting blood glucose ≥200 mg/dL. Mean systolic blood pressure
(≥140 mm Hg) or mean diastolic blood pressure (≥90 mm Hg) or use of antihypertensive
medications was used for the diagnosis of hypertension. Never and former smokers were
defined as nonsmokers and current smokers as smokers. Waist to hip ratio was used for
the diagnosis of obesity following the WHO criteria [19]. Dyslipidemia diagnosis was
based on present intake of lipid-modifying drugs or a LDL/HDL ratio N 3.5.
2.5. Statistical analysis
Discrete variables were presented as numbers and/or percentages and continuous
variables were described by mean values ± standard deviation or median and interquar-
tile range. According to Beutel et al. [12], noise annoyance was defined as the highest an-
noyance rating from any of the categories of noise, regardless of the specific noise source
(aircraft, road traffic, railway, etc.) and time period (daytime or sleep). Source-specific
combined daytime and sleep annoyance was defined as the highest annoyance rating dur-
ing daytime and sleep due to each specific source. Logistic regression models were used to
analyze the association between noise annoyance (per point) and AF in three models with
increasing adjustment. Adjusted ORs are given with 95% CI and p-value.
Model 1: adjustment for age and sex
Model 2: further adjustment for SES, night shift work (yes/no) and depression (yes/no)
Model 3: further adjustment for medication use (antihypertensives, diuretics, beta-
blockers, calcium channel blockers, agents acting on the renin-angiotensin-
aldosterone system (RAAS), lipid modifying agents, diabetic drugs, antithrombotic
agents-all yes/no), diabetes mellitus (yes/no), hypertension (yes/no), smoking (yes/
no), obesity (yes/no), dyslipidemia (yes/no) and family history (FH) of MI/stroke
(yes/no)
Model 3 is considered the most comprehensive model. Further, the introduction of a
night flight ban by the Frankfurt Airport in October 2011 was considered as additional var-
iable by comparing annoyance before and after October 2011 by using the Student's t-test.
All tests were two-sided with a significance level of 5%. As we pursued an explorative de-
sign, no adjustments of p-values for multiple testing were done. Relevant p-values are
highlighted in bold font and the expression “statistical significance” is used for descriptive
reasons only. The statistical analyses were performed using the software R version 3.3.1
(R Core Team. R: A language and environment for statistical computing. R Foundation
for Statistical Computing. Vienna, 2016. http://www.r-project.org/).
3. Results
Of the study cohort of 15,010 people, a total of 14,639 participants an-
swered the questions about noise annoyance of whom 18% (n = 2704)
had a diagnosis of AF (ECG documentation n = 2297, history of AF n =
200, both n = 207). The characteristics of this study population weighted
for the age and sex distribution of the general population (N = 210,867;
Statistisches Bundesamt, Wiesbaden 2011) and stratified by degree of
total noise annoyance are summarized in Table 1.
About 80% of the study participants reported annoyance by noise
(no: 20.7%, slight: 26.6%, moderate: 25.0%, strong: 17.3%, extreme:
10.5%). Compared to participants reporting no annoyance, participants
who reported extreme annoyance had a higher prevalence of AF
(14.6 vs. 23.4%, Fig. 2). The prevalence of depression increased steadily
with the degree of total noise annoyance (6.1 to 11.6%). Midregional
pro atrial natriuretic peptide (MR-proANP) levels tended to increase
with the degree of total noise annoyance (65.7 to 71.5 pmol/L).
Blood pressure, heart rate and CVRFs were not modified by
annoyance. Also no differences in cardiovascular medication and social
variables were found.
Table 2 summarizes specific sources of noise annoyance (binary N 0)
according to the degree of total noise annoyance during daytime and
during sleep. On the total annoyance scale, 84% of the persons were ex-
tremely annoyed by aircraft noise during daytime (69% during sleep),
whereas only 22% were extremely annoyed by railway noise (15% dur-
ing sleep) (Fig. 1).
Table 3 (online only) displays the ORs and 95% CI for AF in relation to
the five different sources of noise annoyance during daytime and
during sleep. There were significant associations between aircraft,
neighbourhood noise annoyance and AF after adjustment for age and
sex, socioeconomic status, depression, nightshift work, CVRFs and
medication (model 3) both during daytime (aircraft: OR 1.04, 95% CI
1.00–1.08; neighbourhood: OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.09–1.20) and during
sleep (aircraft: OR 1.09, 95% CI 1.05–1.13; neighbourhood: OR 1.14,
95% CI 1.07–1.21).
Further, road traffic and railway noise annoyance during sleep (road
traffic: OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.08–1.22; railway: OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.04–1.22) as
well as industrial noise annoyance during daytime (OR 1.11; 95% CI
1.04–1.18) were significantly associated with AF (Table 3).

O. Hahad et al. / International Journal of Cardiology 264 (2018) 79–84
 Associations of road traffic during daytime (OR 1.05; 95% CI 0.99–
1.09) and industrial noise annoyance during sleep (OR 1.14; 95% CI
0.99–1.31) with AF showed borderline (p b 0.10) statistical significance.
No significant association between railway noise annoyance and AF dur-
ing daytime (OR 1.02; 95% CI 0.95–1.09) was found.
Table 4 (online only) displays the associations between source-
specific combined daytime, sleep annoyance and AF. Significant associ-
ations between road traffic, aircraft, neighbourhood, industrial noise an-
noyance and AF were observed, while no association between railway
noise annoyance and AF was found.
Since aircraft noise was the major source of (extreme) annoyance in
the population (Table 2), we further investigated the introduction of a
night flight ban by comparing annoyance before and after October
2011 (Table 5; online only). Interestingly, aircraft noise annoyance dur-
ing daytime and sleep as well as total noise annoyance were signifi-
cantly higher after introduction of the ban. Sex age, SES, time of
current residence, night shift work and depression did not differ signif-
icantly between these groups.
4. Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first study investigating the association
between noise-induced annoyance and the prevalence of AF in a large
cohort. We found that aircraft, road traffic and neighbourhood noise
are the predominant sources of annoyance and that increases in noise
annoyance are associated with a “dose-dependent” increase in AF in
the population analysed (during daytime and/or during sleep). Impor-
tantly, these associations remained valid after controlling for a broad
spectrum of potential confounders.
In our population, we observed a much higher prevalence of AF com-
pared with previous studies [20]. Previous studies made solely based on
history the diagnosis of AF, while the present approach combines re-
ported AF and ECG documentation allowing a more reliable assessment.
Additionally, we performed a sensitivity analysis considering ECG-
diagnosed cases of AF, for which the ORs were similar as compared
with the approach of including history- and/or ECG-diagnosed cases of
AF. Importantly, history-based diagnosis of AF just accounted for 8% of
the total.
Noise is a major source of annoyance in Western European Countries
due to growing urbanisation and increasing demand for transportation.
Noise annoyance is regarded as a complex multidimensional construct,
reflecting the negative connotation that a person attributes to a noise
source. Noise annoyance leads to stress, a condition that has been
shown to be associated with an increase in CVD [4].
As previously reported, most of the study participants were annoyed
by aircraft noise, followed by road traffic noise and neighbourhood
noise [12]. Aircraft noise also represented the leading source of extreme
noise. These observations go along with previous studies demonstrating

 a clear increase in annoyance within the last decade in response to air-
craft noise while annoyance reactions to road noise remained rather
constant [10]. This suggests that different noise sources have a different
impact on annoyance, which stresses the importance of focusing on an-
noyance reactions and not on noise levels.
When comparing the influence of noise annoyance during daytime
and during sleep on AF, we could observe a more frequent AF triggering
effect of annoyance in response to noise during sleep. This might reflect
an adverse effect of noise on sleep quality, which in turn leads to stron-
ger annoyance reactions. Sleep disturbances per se, including short
sleep and fragmentation of sleep are among of the most prevalent rea-
sons for noise complaints and are associated with activation of sympa-
thetic nervous system, thus markedly increasing the risk of ischemic
heart disease, stroke and arrhythmia [21].
The design of the study does not allow inferring causal associations.
There are however, numerous studies linking psychosocial factors with
AF. For example, the Framingham offspring study has reported that the
traits anger, hostility and symptoms of anger increased the risk of AF
substantially [22]. Further evidence was provided by studies in patients
with panic disorders and job strain [23]. In addition, negative emotions
have been shown to be associated with a 3–6 fold increase in AF, while
happiness had a protective effect [24]. Thus it is tempting to speculate
that annoyance-induced stress is contributing at least in part to the in-
creased prevalence in AF. Blood pressure and CVRFs did not change in
relation to the degree of total noise annoyance, an observation that
might be explained by the high prevalence of hypertension, indepen-
dently of noise annoyance. Moreover, we found elevated levels of the
atrial stress marker MR-proANP to be associated with the degree of
total noise annoyance. Importantly, this biomarker has been shown to
have prognostic value in AF [25].
As already reported, we found an association between noise annoy-
ance and depression [12,26]. Depression and CVD are known to affect
each other reciprocally [27]. Depression and noise annoyance are the re-
sult of adaptive processes that synergistically interact in determining
the risk of AF. There is a large body of evidence showing that psychoso-
cial distress is related to CVD by influencing hemodynamics, hemostasis,
inflammatory processes, vascular function and autonomic tone [28,29].
By using the GHS cohort, we recently demonstrated that depression is
significantly associated with AF [30]. Importantly, the quantitative ef-
fects of annoyance and depression were comparable, but independent
of each other as our analysis revealed. Further, we performed a stratified
analysis by depression which showed no significant interaction be-
tween annoyance and depression. Given this framework of depression
and CVD, bidirectional effects between noise annoyance and AF might
be conceivable, such that suffering from AF might trigger stress re-
sponses and impair adaptation, which may further lead to increased
vulnerability to stress and decreased stress resistance in order to cope
with an unpleasant noise source. Longitudinal designs are necessary to
define further causal pathways.
A recent study investigating the relationship between residential ex-
posure to traffic noise and risk of incident AF found that road traffic
noise was significantly associated with higher risk for AF. This associa-
tion was lost after further adjustment for air pollution (NOx or NO2
[31]). Also, no significant association was found with exposure to rail-
way noise. Regarding railway noise, the authors explained the lack of
significance due to the circumstance that exposure to railway noise is
perceived as less annoying than road traffic noise, revealing the impor-
tance of annoyance in this framework. Further, efforts should be made
to distinguish adequately between the effects of noise exposure and
air pollution on CVD (for review see [32]).
As exposure to aircraft noise was the major source of (extreme) an-
noyance in the population, we have further investigated the introduc-
tion of a mitigation manoeuver such as the night flight ban by
Frankfurt Airport in October 2011, by comparing annoyance before
and after October 2011. Our results suggest that the introduction of
the night flight ban was not effective in order to reduce annoyance. An-
noyance reactions during daytime as well as during sleep were rather
increased after introduction of night flight ban. Thus, the ban on sched-
uled movements between 11:00 p.m. and 5:00 a.m. is probably not suf-
ficient to ensure a positive effect on annoyance rates. Of note, parallel to

 the night flight ban, a new runaway was implemented in 2011, resulting
in increased flight movements during daytime and heavy aircraft traffic
load in the hours immediately before and after the no-fly time period
(10 to 11 p.m., 5 to 6 a.m.). Nevertheless the total number of flights dur-
ing 24 h did not change. In addition, annoyance reactions may have
been enhanced by increased sensitivity and awareness for this specific
issue secondary to discussion of environmental policy and strong atten-
tion to this topic by media. Thus, people are getting more aware that
traffic noise has adverse effects for their health, which of course may
further increase their level of annoyance in a positive feedback fashion.
Nevertheless, the introduction of the night flight ban was not associated
with a reduction in annoyance. Therefore, protected nighttime should
be prolonged and flight movements during daytime should be reduced,
to decrease the annoyance of population and thus adverse effects for
their health.
A strength of the present study is the large sample size of the
population-representative GHS. The comprehensive and standardized
assessment of noise annoyance, AF and potential confounders repre-
sents a unique resource enabling analysis of subgroups (e.g. coverage
of multiple annoyance sources during daytime and during sleep). More-
over, a further strength is the definition of AF through ECG-based diag-
nosis in addition to a physician-diagnosed history of AF, and the
inclusion of a wide range of age groups. In addition, we were able to ad-
just the results for a broad spectrum of associated variables in order to
ensure the validity of the results.
The prevalence of AF was higher compared with previous studies
[20], which might be explained by the fact that our diagnosis also in-
cluded incidental findings of AF at the time of inclusion in the study,
thus allowing a more reliable assessment. In a sensitivity analysis in-
cluding ECG-diagnosed cases of AF only the ORs were similar to the
overall cohort. Importantly, history-based diagnosis of AF accounted
for only 8% of the total. A limitation of the study is the cross-sectional
design, which hampers causal interpretations. Longitudinal studies
would provide useful information to further determine causal links.
The prevalence of AF should be treated with caution because AF is
often subclinical and asymptomatic and therefore remain undiagnosed.
We cannot rule out the possibility of selection, recall and self-report re-
sponse bias. Although the present study had a high response rate of 60%,
selection bias might still have occurred due to self-selection of people
based on motivational differences for participating in the GHS, e.g. peo-
ple with chronic conditions are more likely to participate in a health
study. Self-report response bias targets the participants' abilities for in-
trospection and tendency to respond in certain ways. Also, there is a risk
for recall bias due to the circumstance that cases potentially recall noise
annoyance and associated variables different than non-cases. We also
cannot exclude that air pollution annoyance may have interacted with
noise annoyance although more recent studies indicated that both
may impact health independently [33]. Lastly, as the present study re-
lies on noise annoyance as a proxy for the actual noise exposure, expo-
sure misclassification has most likely occurred. Also, misclassification
may differ between people with or no disease simply because they are
more noise sensitive, all of which may have biased our results. On the
other hand, there is an ongoing debate in the current literature whether
the noise level or the annoyance to noise is a more eligible indicator or
maker of CV risk. Noise annoyance reflects an individual cognitive-
evaluation of a noise source and thus may be more suitable for assessing
noise-induced impairment, while its direct biological impact remains
still unclear. In turn, there are non-acoustical factors, notably noise sen-
sitivity, which has been shown to moderate negative health impacts and
affects annoyance reactions [34]. The present study cannot resolve this
issue as no data were available on noise levels and sensitivity.
In summary, the current study describes a significant association
between noise and the arrhythmia AF. Although hypotheses about
the emotional reactions and the development of arrhythmia are rea-
sonable, this is to our knowledge the first paper to show an associa-
tion between annoyance and AF. Thus, future studies addressing the
pathophysiology of annoyance-induced AF should be conducted
and interventions to prevent annoyance-induced AF should be
implemented.
