Abstract
Older men (n = 12) and women (n = 18) 65–80 years of age completed 12 weeks of exercise and took either a placebo or resveratrol (RSV) (500 
mg/d) to test the hypothesis that RSV treatment combined with exercise would increase mitochondrial density, muscle fatigue resistance, and 
cardiovascular function more than exercise alone. Contrary to our hypothesis, aerobic and resistance exercise coupled with RSV treatment did 
not reduce cardiovascular risk further than exercise alone. However, exercise added to RSV treatment improved the indices of mitochondrial 
density, and muscle fatigue resistance more than placebo and exercise treatments. In addition, subjects that were treated with RSV had an 
increase in knee extensor muscle peak torque (8%), average peak torque (14%), and power (14%) after training, whereas exercise did not 
increase these parameters in the placebo-treated older subjects. Furthermore, exercise combined with RSV significantly improved mean fiber 
area and total myonuclei by 45.3% and 20%, respectively, in muscle fibers from the vastus lateralis of older subjects. Together, these data 
indicate a novel anabolic role of RSV in exercise-induced adaptations of older persons and this suggests that RSV combined with exercise might 
provide a better approach for reversing sarcopenia than exercise alone.
Key words: Mitochondria—Sarcopenia—Fiber type—Exercise—Muscle—Strength—Fatigue
Sarcopenia is predictive of falls and is associated with periods of 
hospital-associated immobilization (1). This is noteworthy, as aging 
muscles display an impaired or failed recovery following immobili-
zation-induced muscle atrophy (2,3). Several potential countermeas-
ures to unloading-induced atrophy have been tested, but most have 
only been partially successful. For example, taurine was shown to 
prevent the slow to fast myosin shift with unloading (4), but it did 
not prevent the loss of muscle mass. Insulin growth factor-I overex-
pression during hindlimb unloading in rodents induced some poten-
tial molecular signaling improvements, especially the atrogen Muscle 
RING-finger protein-1 (MuRF1), but there was no overall change 
in muscle protein loss or fiber type transition with this treatment 
(5). In addition, β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate, a leucine metabolite, 
provided modest protection against skeletal loss of muscle mass 
during disuse in sarcopenic rats (6). We have found that green tea 
extract increased satellite cell proliferation and differentiation in rat 
plantaris and soleus muscles during recovery from hindlimb suspen-
sion as compared to vehicle-treated muscles and decreased oxidative 
stress and the abundance of the Bcl-2–associated X protein (Bax), a 
proapoptotic protein, yet this did not further improve muscle recov-
ery in reloaded muscles over placebo (PL) treatments (7).
In vitro studies have shown that resveratrol (3,5,4′-trihydrox-
ystilbene; RSV) increases protein synthesis (8), inhibits protein deg-
radation, and attenuates atrophy of skeletal muscle fibers (9–12). A 
high dose of RSV in vivo (400 mg/kg/d) was reported to attenuate 
muscle fiber atrophy following hindlimb suspension (13) in rodents.

We have found that a low dose (12.5 mg/kg/d) of RSV (14) had a 
trend (p = .06) to blunt the loss of muscle mass during hindlimb 
suspension in old rats but it did not improve recovery or increase 
the number of satellite cells or muscle mass after disuse in old ani-
mals (15). Nevertheless, other data failed to identify RSV-mediated 
improvements in metabolic function in rodents (16). Furthermore, 
while exercise adaptations in the elderly are typically attenuated 
as compared to responses in young adults (17), it is not known if 
RSV coupled to exercise provides a stronger stimulus for reducing or 
reversing sarcopenia in humans (18) than exercise alone.
Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine if 12 weeks of 
exercise would improve muscle fatigue resistance more than exer-
cise alone in older men and women. We tested the hypothesis that 
RSV treatment would increase mitochondrial density, which would 
decrease muscle fatigue resistance, and improve indices for cardio-
vascular risk as compared to exercise alone in older men and women.
Methods
Detailed methods are provided in Supplementary Methods.
Subjects
Healthy older men (n = 12) and women (n = 18) completed this 
study. The subjects were randomly assigned in a balanced design to 
include the same number of males (n = 6) and females (n = 9) in each 
experimental group. A resting 12-lead ECG and a symptom-limited 
maximal graded exercise test (GXT) were conducted to rule out 
heart disease and to establish proper cardiovascular function. The 
study was approved by the West Virginia University Institutional 
Review Board for Human Research, and all participants signed 
informed consent prior to participating in the study.
Body Mass Index and Body Fat
Trained personnel measured height, weight, and waist and hip cir-
cumference. Body composition was estimated via air displacement 
plethysmography (BOD POD, COSMED, Inc.). The body mass 
index was calculated as weight (kg) divided by height (m) squared.
Blood Indices
Venous blood from the antecubital vein was obtained after a 
12-hour overnight fast. Fasted post-training samples were collected a 
minimum of 48 hours after the last exercise session. Plasma obtained 
from blood sampling was analyzed at West Virginia University 
Hospital’s analytical laboratory.
Assessment of Maximal Oxygen Uptake
Oxygen consumed (VO2), carbon dioxide produced (VCO2), respira-
tory exchange ratio = VCO2/VO2, ventilation-expired (VE), ventila-
tion-inhaled (VI), ventilatory threshold (VT), ventilatory equivalent 
for CO2 (VE/VCO2), and O2 (VE/VO2) were measured using a vali-
dated (19), twenty-second averaging breath-by-breath analysis sys-
tem (TrueOne 2400; ParvoMedics, Sandy, UT).
Muscle Function and Fatigue
Maximal torque
Measures of muscle strength and fatigue were obtained using a veloc-
ity-dependent Biodex System 3 dynamometer (Biodex, Inc., Shirley, 
NY) because function and fatigue are compromised in aging (20). 
Maximal knee extension torque was evaluated at 60, and 240°/s. 
Data were calculated for peak torque (Newton-meters), total work 
in one repetition (Joules), total work over seven repetitions (Joules), 
work fatigue (%), average power (Watts), and average peak torque 
over seven repetitions (Newton-meters). Subjects were not provided 
with encouragement but the investigator counted each repetition 
loudly during the test.
Isokinetic fatigue
Fatigue data were calculated from the decline in torque over 32 
isokinetic contractions at 240°/s on the Biodex unit. This repre-
sents a moderate load for older subjects (21). Muscular fatigue was 
expressed as a fatigue index (fatigue index = [1 − (initial torque − 
final torque)/initial torque]). These are similar to methods used pre-
viously in our labs (22,23).
Muscle Samples
Needle biopsies of the vastus lateralis muscle were collected under 
local anesthesia with 2% lidocaine using a Bergstrom needle as 
described previously (17,24,25). The subjects refrained from strenu-
ous activity for 36 hours prior to the biopsy and for 48 hours after 
the biopsy. Visible blood and connective tissue were removed from 
the biopsy sample and the tissue was frozen in isopentane cooled to 
the temperature of liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C until analysis.
Muscle Myosin Composition and Morphology
Frozen tissue sections were cut at −20°C and placed on glass slides, 
air-dried, and incubated overnight at 4°C with antibodies from the 
Hybridoma Bank against: myosin heavy chain (MHC) IIA (SC-71), 
MHCI (BAF8S), and MHC IIX (6H1). Fiber area and the minimum 
Feret diameter was determined from the digital images and quanti-
fied by Image J software (NIH) from a minimum of 500 fibers. All 
analyses were performed with the investigator blinded to treatment 
(RSV or PL) using established methods (26,27).
Muscle Ultrastructure
Fifty fibers were randomly selected from five specimen blocks for 
ultrastructural analyses. The electron micrographs were analyzed 
by a stereological 168-point short-line test grid (28). Morphometric 
measures were made of the proportion of fibers occupied by the 
mitochondria. The stereological measures were made without the 
investigator’s knowledge of the group that was analyzed.
Mitochondria Biogenesis
The relative number of copies of human mitochondrial DNA 
(mtDNA) was quantified by real-time PCR using a Human mtDNA 
Monitoring Primer Set (Takara/Clontech). Nuclear DNA (nDNA) 
content was used as a standard. Two mtDNA targets (ND1, ND5) 
and two nDNA targets (SLCO2B1, SERPINA1) were used for the 
detection assay. The manufacturer has designed the primers to avoid 
amplification of pseudogenes. DNA was purified from skeletal mus-
cle biopsies (Qiagen) and amplified with the primers according to the 
manufacture’s recommendation. The CT value for each mitochon-
dria and genomic DNA primer was determined and 2(−ΔΔCT) for the 
primer pairs and the mtDNA copy number was determined.
PCR Arrays for Mitochondrial Metabolism
RNA was purified from muscle biopsies and mRNA for mito-
chondrial genes was assessed using the Human Mitochondria RT2 
Profiler PCR Array (Qiagen). ΔCT was calculated for each gene

and the housekeeping genes and the fold change between pre-
exercised and post-exercised groups for each gene was calculated 
using 2(−ΔΔCT). The fold differences of 2(−ΔΔCT) between exercise and 
PL groups were reported as log base 2 fold differences between 
genes in pre- to post-training conditions, or between pre-exercise 
and between post-exercise conditions for PL and RSV treatments.
Satellite Cell and Myonuclei
Antibodies against paired box transcription factor 7 (Pax7; 
Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa city, IA) was used 
to identify satellite cells and laminin (Developmental Studies 
Hybridoma Bank) was used to identify the boundaries of muscle 
fibers. The sections were counter stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phe-
nylindole (DAPI) to visualize all of the nuclei in each tissue section 
(Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The number of nuclei that 
were positive for Pax7 and the total number of DAPI-positive nuclei 
were counted from digital confocal images (Zeiss) by an investigator 
who was blinded to the experimental groups.
DNA Oxidative Damage
Fixed tissue sections were incubated with 8-hydroxyguanosine 
(8-OHdG; Santa Cruz) an indication of oxidative damage to skel-
etal muscle nuclear DNA. To confirm that the nuclei were inside the 
boundary of the muscle fibers, the tissue sections were also incubated 
with antibodies against dystrophin and laminin (Developmental 
Studies Hybridoma Bank). The sections were counter stained with 
DAPI and then examined by an investigator who was blinded to the 
experimental groups.
Exercise 
Training and RSV 
Treatment
As exercise provides health benefits for older subjects, all subjects 
were exercised for 12 weeks in this study. Resistance training was 
given to provide an anabolic effect for muscle growth. Aerobic train-
ing was added to improve mitochondrial biogenesis and function, as 
mitochondria are central to aging-associated signaling for cell death 
including apoptosis (7,29,30) and autophagy (31,32).
The subjects were randomly assigned in a double-blind manner 
into either a 12-week exercise group that took 500 mg RSV/d in cap-
sule form (RSV; 80% female) or a 12-week exercise control group 
that took 500 mg/d of a corn starch PL in capsule form (PL; 80% 
female). The code identifying the PL and RSV groups was not broken 
until the data analysis was completed, and then the subjects were 
placed in the appropriate groups for data analyses.
Statistical Analysis
Pre-exercise variables were compared between groups with a one-
way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and post-training data were 
compared with a two-way repeated measures ANOVA as group (PL 
vs RSV) and condition (pre- vs post-exercise). A Tukey’s post hoc test 
was conducted if a main effect or an interaction effect was identified 
by the ANOVA. A Condition (ie, training) × Group interaction indi-
cates that the response to training differed between the PL and RSV 
groups. The data are reported as means ± SEM. P ≤.05 was defined 
as statistically significant.
Results
Effects of Exercise 
Training on Body Composition 
and Metabolic Biomarkers
One subject in the PL group and four subjects in the RSV group 
reported a lack of time to commit to training and withdrew from the 
study and additional subjects were recruited to the subject groups 
so that 15 subjects completed the study in both PL and RSV groups.
The characteristics of the subjects that completed the study are 
shown by treatment group in Table 1. Data are separated by sex 
for each group and are given in Supplementary Table 1. Both PL 
and RSV groups had similar characteristics at the beginning of the 
study. Three-way ANOVA analysis showed that there were subject 
group differences based on the sex of the subjects with men having 
greater body weight (p < .001), body fat (p = .026), and lean body 
mass (p < .001) than women, but there were no differences in these 
variables between women in the two groups or men in the PL or RSV 
groups (Supplementary Table 1); however, there were no differences

between groups when males and females were averaged within each 
group.
Exercise resulted in significant reductions in total triglycerides, 
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein choles-
terol, and serum insulin, but RSV did not change these metabolic 
variables further (Table 1). This exercise effect and lack of RSV 
effect was similar in both men and women (Supplementary Table 
1). Neither the exercise nor the RSV treatment significantly altered 
bodyweight, body fat, body mass index, or lean body mass in older 
subjects (Table 1).
Effects of RSV on Improvements in Oxygen Uptake 
to 12 Weeks of Exercise
Cardiovascular adaptations to exercise training are best reflected by 
changes in absolute maximal oxygen uptake as relative measures of 
oxygen uptake can be affected by changes in bodyweight. Before 
exercise, absolute VO2 max was similar in PL- and RSV-treated 
groups. The ANOVA analysis revealed a significant main effect (p < 
.05) in absolute VO2 max on condition (pre- to post-exercise). While 
the post hoc analyses to identify the source of the main effect showed 
that the absolute VO2 max was significantly improved by exercise 
in only the RSV-treated subjects (p = .028), there appeared to be no 
central improvement in absolute VO2 max in the exercise-trained PL 
group (p = .286). There was no statistically significant interaction 
(p = .09) between Group (PL vs RSV) × Condition (pre- vs post-
exercise). The absolute VO2 max data are shown in Figure 1A.
Similarly, the ANOVA analysis showed that there was a signifi-
cant main effect for condition (pre- vs post- exercise differences; p < 
.05) in the relative maximal oxygen uptake when the subjects were 
considered as a single group. There was not a statistically significant 
interaction between Group (PL vs RSV) × Condition (pre- vs post-
exercise) (p = .71). Post hoc analyses identified a significant improve-
ment in relative VO2 max in RSV-treated subjects (24.0 ± 1.3 mL/
kg/min vs 28.7 ± 1.7 mL/kg/min, p < .05) but relative VO2 max was 
unchanged in PL-treated subjects who exercised (23.7 ± 1.3 mL/kg/
min vs 26.1 ± 1.4 mL/kg/min, p = .13). This improvement in relative 
maximal oxygen uptake likely reflects a central adaptation in RSV-
treated subjects because bodyweight did not differ before or after 
exercise in RSV-treated subjects, and bodyweight in PL and RSV 
groups were not changed by treatment or exercise (Table 1).
Mitochondrial Density
There was a significant main effect of condition (pre- vs post-exer-
cise) for mitochondrial volume density (p < .05). Without consider-
ing the apparent health of the mitochondria, quantification of the 
volume density of mitochondria from longitudinal sections was 
9.3% ± 1.3% before exercise, and 13.5% ± 2.3% post-training in 
muscle samples from the PL group but post hoc analyses following 
the identification of the significant main effect of condition showed 
that this did not represent a statistically significant improvement in 
mitochondrial volume density (p = .093). On the other hand, post 
hoc analysis of the significant main effect of condition revealed that 
mitochondria volume density in the vastus lateralis significantly 
increased from 9.8% ± 1.7% pre-training to 16.8% ± 2.5% (p < 
.05) in the RSV group post-training. The fiber type of the samples 
could not be determined from the electron micrographs. Of inter-
est, apparently morphologically normal (red arrows) and abnormal 
mitochondria (blue arrows) could be identified before and after 
exercise in PL- and RSV-treated samples (Figure 1B), although these 
were not quantified. Nevertheless, it was apparent that mitochondria 
with normal morphological characteristics (eg, normal cristae and 
mitochondria boundaries etc.) were abundant in the RSV-treated 
longitudinal muscle samples, but abnormal mitochondria (broken 
cristae etc.) were readily obvious in the post-trained PL-treated sam-
ples. However, the two-way ANOVA did not identify a significant 
effect for group (PL vs RSV) and no significant interaction effect 
between group and condition were found.
Signaling for Mitochondrial Biogenesis and 
Mitochondrial Function
Total RNA was isolated from muscle biopsies before and after 
exercise after PL and RSV treatments. The RNA was used for mito-
chondrial microarray analyses. The fold difference values of altered 
mRNAs are presented as heat maps of log2 transformed fold change 
from pre- to post-exercise (Figure 1C). Scatter plots showing nor-
malized log 10-transformed signal intensities for each comparison 
show global gene fold differences between PL or RSV groups before 
and after exercise training (Supplementary Figures 1–4).
RSV promoted proapoptosis signaling
The expression of apoptotic genes BCL2 antagonist/killer 1 (BAK1), 
BH3-interacting domain death agonist (BID), cyclin-dependent 
kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A), phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate-
induced protein 1 (PMAIP1), strafin (SFN), dynamin 1-like protein 
(DNM1L), and prefoldin-like chaperone (UXT) had a 3- to 11-fold 
greater pre- to post-exercise change in RSV as compared to PL mus-
cle samples (Table 2; Supplementary Results).
RSV promoted antiapoptotic changes
Two antiapoptotic proteins, B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) and BCL2-
like 1 (Bcl-xL), had approximately twofold greater gene expres-
sion differences pre- to post-exercise in RSV as compared to PL 
treatments.
RSV regulation of mitochondrial metabolic genes
Several mitochondrial metabolic genes were expressed to higher lev-
els from pre- to post-exercise in RSV versus PL subjects. This included 
carnitine/choline acetyltransferase (CPT1B, 4-fold), COX18 (3-fold), 
uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2, 6-fold), uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3, 
5-fold), and hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (HPRT1, 
16-fold) (Table 2).
RSV regulation of mitochondrial morphology
Mitofusin 1 (MFN1), mitofusin 2 (MFN2), and morphology regula-
tor (MSTO1) had approximately 7-, 2.5-, and 3-fold greater gene 
level pre- to post-exercise in muscles from RSV versus PL subjects, 
respectively (Table 2; Supplementary Results).
Carrier/shuttle/import proteins
Compared to PL, RSV had two- to fourfold greater pre- to post-
exercise increases in gene expression for solute carrier family 25 
(SLC25) members, including SLC25A10, SLC25A22, SLC25A27, 
SLC25A31, and SLC25A37, and StAR-related lipid transfer domain 
containing 3 (STARD3) (Table 2). Similarly, genes for members of 
the translocase of inner mitochondrial membrane (TIMM) fam-
ily transport protein, including TIMM10, TIMM10B, TIMM44, 
TIMM50, and TIMM8A, and translocase of outer mitochondrial 
membrane (TOMM) family members, TOMM34 and TOMM40L, 
inner mitochondrial membrane peptidase subunit 2 (IMMP2L), and 
leucine-rich pentatricopeptide repeat containing (LRPPRC) protein 
had 3- to 13-fold greater gene differences in muscles of RSV-treated

Genes 
That Had a Lower Increase With RSV versus 
PL 
Treatments
The genes in which there was a twofold or more lower in RSV-
treated versus PL-treated genes are shown in Table 3 and Figure 1C.
Apoptosis/autophagy
SH3 domain containing GRB2-like endophilin B1 (SH3GLB1) 
and Ras homolog family (RHOT) members T1 (RHOT1) and T2 
(RHOT2) had a approximately 5-, 2.5-, and 7-fold lower gene differ-
ences in RSV versus PL pre- to post-exercise, respectively (Table 3).
Carrier/shuttle/import proteins
Gene expression differences from pre- to post-exercise in SLC25A4, 
SLC25A13, SLC25A14, SLC25A15, SLC25A19, SLC25A20, 
SLC25A21, and SLC25A30, mitochondrial import proteins, metaxin 
2 (MTX2), and translocase of inner mitochondrial membrane 23 
(TIMM23) were two- to eightfold lower in RSV- versus PL-treated 
muscles (Table 3; Supplementary Results).
Decreased RSV regulation of mitochondrial metabolic genes
The gene expressions levels of COX10, and carnitine palmitoyltrans-
ferase 2 (CPT2), GrpE-like 1, and mitochondrial (GRPEL1) and 
mitochondrial intermediate peptidase (MIPEP) were two- to fourfold 
lower in RSV-treated muscles as compared to PL-treated muscles.
Muscle Strength and Fatigue
Subjects who exercised and consumed RSV had an 8.5% (p < .05) 
increase in knee extensor peak torque that was measured at 60°/s as 
compared to the pre-training data, whereas there was no change in 
maximal torque production in the subjects who consumed the PL 
and exercised for 12 weeks. In a similar fashion, average knee exten-
sion torque that was measured at 60°/s, increased by 14.1% (p < .05) 
in subjects that had taken RSV from pre- to post-training, whereas, 
there was no significant change in the average peak torque at 60°/s in 
subjects who consumed the PL and trained for 12 weeks.

Muscle power was unchanged in PL-fed subjects from before to 
after 12 weeks of exercise training. However, RSV-treated subjects 
had a 14.0% (p < .05) increase in knee extensor muscle power after 
training as compared to before training (Figure 1E). The interaction 
between Session (pre- or post-training) × Group (PL vs RSV) was 
significant for average power in knee extension (Watts) at 60°/s (p 
= .004) and average peak torque over seven repetitions in extension 
(Newton-meters) at 60°/s (p = .038) (Figure 1D). Other indices of 
muscle function were unchanged by RSV treatment as compared to 
PL treatment (Supplementary Tables 2–7).
Muscle Fiber Characteristics
Fiber type
An example of tissue cross-sections that were used for fiber type 
and fiber size distribution is shown in Figure 2. Before training, 
type I fiber distribution was not statistically different in the vastus 
lateralis of PL-treated (68.3% ± 6.3%) and RSV-treated (51.9% ± 
5.5%) groups. Type I fiber composition was not significantly altered 
after 12 weeks of exercise training in PL-treated (50.4% ± 6.9%) or 
RSV-treated (43.0% ± 5.5%) subjects. In the PL group, the distribu-
tion of type IIA fibers was unchanged before (31.2% ± 6.0%) as 
compared to after training (48.3% ± 5.9%). Similarly, in the RSV-
treated group, the distribution of type IIA fibers was unchanged 
from pre-training (47.8% ± 5.5%) to post-training (55.6% ± 5.1%). 
A small number of fibers co-expressed type I and type IIA myosin 
heavy chain. There was no difference before exercise in the percent 
of type IIA/I co-expressing fibers between the PL group (0.45% ± 
0.32%) and the RSV group (0.33% ± 0.35%). There was no sta-
tistically significant change in the percent distribution of type IIA/I 
co-expressing fibers after exercise in either the PL-treated (1.37% ± 
0.96%) or RSV-treated (1.39% ± 0.56%) subjects. Type IIX fibers 
were rare and made up less than 0.1% of the total population of 
fibers that were examined in muscle biopsies of the subjects in this 
study. Consequently, few fibers co-expressed IIA/IIX in this sample. 
The IIA/IIX fibers made up 0.014% ± 0.01% and 0.05% ± 0.02% 
of the fiber population in the PL group before and after exercise, 
respectively. Similarly, the percentage of type IIA/IIX fibers was and 
0.017% ± 0.02% and 0.09% ± 0.03% in the RSV group.
Type I fiber size
To test if fiber size were improved with RSV treatment, we obtained 
fiber cross-sectional area and Feret diameters from tissue sections 
that had been incubated in antibodies against type I, type IIA, and 
type IIX myosin heavy chain (Figure 2A). The data suggest that fiber 
area adaptations to exercise and treatment were fiber type specific. 
Twelve weeks of exercise significantly improved mean fiber type I 
area (Figure 2B) and Feret diameter (There was a shift to the right in 
the fiber area-frequency histogram of PL-treated subjects especially 
in the 5,000–6,000 µm2 range (Figure 2D). RSV-treated fibers also 
had a shift to the right of the fiber area-frequency distribution and a 
significantly greater percentage of fibers larger than 7,000 µm2 after 
training as compared to before training (Figure 2E).
These differences can be seen readily in the cumulative frequency 
distribution for type I fibers, where there is a small shift towards 
larger fibers in the PL trained group but a clearer shift to larger fib-
ers was found in the RSV-treated group (Figure 2F; Supplementary 
Figure 5).
Type IIA fiber size
Unlike the adaptations in type I fibers, 12 weeks of exercise failed to 
improve mean type IIA fiber area or Feret diameter in the PL group 
(Figure 3A). In contrast to the PL group, in the subjects treated with 
RSV, type IIA fiber area and Feret diameter were 32.2% and 11.9% 
greater, respectively, after 12 weeks of training as compared to pre-
training (Figure 3B). Exercise training in the PL group had a right-
ward shift in the type IIA fiber area-frequency distribution with a 
greater frequency of fibers with sizes exceeding 6,000 µm2 (Figure 
3C). Type II fibers from the RSV-treated group had a shift to the right 
of the fiber area-frequency distribution and a significantly greater 
percentage of fibers larger than 5,000 µm2 after training as com-
pared to before training (Figure 3D). The similarity in the pre- and 
post-training type IIA cumulative frequency distribution can been 
readily seen for the PL trained group (Figure 3C), whereas a shift to 
larger fibers can be seen in the trained RSV treated type IIA fibers as 
compared to before training (Figure 3E). Although the cumulative 
frequency curves for the type IIA fibers shifted to the right after exer-
cise as compared to before exercise, the shift to larger fibers (shift to

the right) was more pronounced in type IIA fibers of the RSV group 
(Figure 3D–F; Supplementary Figure 6).
Type IIA/type IIX co-expressing fiber size
There did not appear to be any fibers that were solely expressing type 
IIX myosin heavy chain in the biopsy samples. There were very few 
fibers that co-expressed type IIA and type IIX myosin heavy chain 
before exercise in most subjects. Although there was a tendency for 
more fibers to co-express both type IIA and type IIX myosin heavy 
chain after exercise, there was considerable variability among the 
subjects in both groups. Type IIA/IIX co-expressing fibers were rela-
tively small and averaged 1677.8 ± 246 µm2 after exercise in the 
PL group and 1834.4 ± 537.1 µm2 after exercise in the RSV-treated 
group but the low number of fibers and the large variation in size 
prevented any statistically important observations in this fiber type.
Nuclei and Satellite Cell Content
Although there was no statistical change in the number of nuclei/
fiber with the PL treatment after training as compared to the pre-
training data, the total number of nuclei (satellite cell + myonuclei) 
was increased by 20% (p < .05) in the RSV-treated tissue samples 
of RSV-treated muscles as compared to the pre-training samples. 
The number of Pax7 positive nuclei (satellite cells) was significantly 
increased from 0.45 to 1.1 Pax7 satellite cells/fiber (p < .05) in the 
post-trained sample of the RSV-treated subjects, but total satellite 
cell content/fiber did not change in the PL-treated samples (Figure 
4A–D).
Oxidative Damage
8-OHdG-positive nuclei were used as an indication of oxidative 
DNA damage in nuclei. No nuclei that resided between the basal 
lamina and sarcolemma were 8-OHdG positive. However, nuclei 
that were either inside the basal lamina or outside the basal lamina 
were identified to have oxidative damage. 8-OHdG-positive nuclei

that were located outside of the basal lamina were not quantified. 
Oxidative damage of DNA as measured by 8-OHdG-positive nuclei 
inside the basal lamina was 20.9% and 18.8% in muscles from the 
pre-training biopsies of PL and RSV treatment groups. Exercise 
decreased the number of nuclei that were located inside the basal 
lamina with oxidative damage in both PL (5.6% of the total nuclei) 
and RSV (3.7% of the total nuclei) groups, but there was some vari-
ability between subjects in each group and there were no statistically 
significant differences between RSV and PL groups (Figure 4E–G). 
These data suggest that there is less oxidative damage after 12 weeks 
of exercise training but that RSV treatment did not reduce the per-
cent of total muscle nuclei (inside the basal lamina) with DNA dam-
age further.
Discussion
VO2 max and fatigue resistance have been reported to improve 
when RSV was combined with endurance exercise training (33,34). 
However, other preclinical long-term studies have also reported that 
RSV provided modest or no increases in reducing aging-associated 
decrements in muscle mass or oxidative stress (16,35). In addition, 
several clinical RSV studies in humans have shown no, or only minor 
improvements in function (36–38). In contrast, our data suggests 
that RSV acts synergistically with exercise-induced signaling path-
ways to enhance cellular and molecular adaptations that lead to 
improved mitochondria density, oxygen uptake, fiber area, and mus-
cle function in aged persons.
Mitochondria and Oxygen Consumption
Consistent with our hypothesis, we found that RSV improved 
maximal oxygen consumption and mitochondrial volume density 
more so than exercise alone (Figure 1). We noticed that in the elec-
tron micrographs, some of the mitochondria appeared to be mor-
phologically appropriate, while others appeared to have increased 
spacing of the cristae and less dense packing of the mitochondrial 
membrane. The RSV-treated samples appeared to have fewer mito-
chondria with abnormal morphology as compared to PL-treated 
muscles. The implications are of course that more mitochondria 
that are not “healthy” would not be of any advantage to the 
muscle; whereas if the mitochondria are morphologically sound 
and presumably fully functional then we might assume that, the 
increase in mitochondrial density could be of benefit for improved 
energy production in the muscle cells. Based on the subjective 
evaluation of the micrographs, we speculate that the better mito-
chondrial morphology along with greater mitochondrial volume 
density in RSV-treated muscles after exercise training as compared 
to PL conditions may have occurred in part to removal or repair 
of the mitochondria with abnormal morphology. Nevertheless, we 
have no way of knowing if the appearance of abnormal mitochon-
dria had any negative effect on the mitochondria’s ability to gener-
ate ATP or to oxidize substrates.
Consistent with the increase in mitochondria volume density, 
there was some enhancement of gene expression with RSV treat-
ment in genes associated mitochondrial morphology, and mito-
chondrial import (Table 2). It was also particularly interesting to 
note that RSV also increased genes associated with mitochondrial-
regulated apoptotic signaling. However, apoptotic signaling might 
be an important mechanism to remove dysfunctional organelles 
and this could be part of a process to “clean” up and remove

counted as it was not possible to tell if they were migrating from another 
muscle fiber, or if they would contribute to new de novo muscle fibers.

dysfunctional proteins in aging. However, this is not a simple rela-
tionship because several apoptotic genes were also decreased as 
were genes associated with autophagy in RSV- versus PL-treated 
muscle cells (Table 3). Furthermore, a number of import genes 
were downregulated in RSV-treated samples pre- to post-exercise 
as compared to PL-treated samples (Table 3), perhaps as a result 
of a greater magnitude of proapoptotic signaling and removal of 
dysfunctional proteins (Table 3). This varied gene regulation of 
mitochondrial-associated apoptotic and import signaling war-
rants further investigation, to determine if these changes provide 
an improved muscle environment for adaptation to exercise with 
RSV in elderly subjects.
Our results in older subjects in the current study differ some-
what with data from Scribbans and colleagues (39) who reported 
no additive effects of RSV supplementation on aerobic exercise per-
formance. Gliemann and colleagues (40) have reported that RSV 
might blunt the effects of aerobic exercise training on low-density 
lipoprotein, total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein ratio, and tri-
glycerides. However, we did not observe any blunting of these meas-
ures in our study, but rather we found a small synergistic effect of 
combining RSV with exercise training (aerobic + resistance exercise) 
on maximal oxygen uptake but no synergistic improvement in the 
lipid profiles in older subjects (Table 1).
It is unlikely that RSV either blunted or prevented some of the 
improvements in cardiovascular indices or mitochondrial function 
that might have been expected as part of exercise-induced adapta-
tions. Otherwise, we would have expected to have poorer functional 
outcomes (VO2 max, fatigue resistance, mitochondrial volume etc.), 
in RSV-treated muscles, but this was not the case.
Our data do not support a RSV-mediated improvement in lipid pro-
files, or a reduction in oxidative damage that is additive to exercise in 
older subjects. However, it is possible that the dose that we gave the sub-
jects (500 mg/d) was not sufficient to result in some of the metabolic and/
or mitochondrial enhancements that have been reported in preclinical 
animal models. Metabolic rates differ in humans and rodents, and after 
a first pass through the liver and perhaps the active RSV per se or active 
metabolites of RSV may have differed or been proportionally lower in 
humans who took RSV and exercised.
Muscle Function
Exercise improvements were observed in knee extension strength 
(peak torque, average peak torque, and average power) in RSV-
treated subjects but not in PL-treated subjects who exercised for 
12 weeks. As the randomly assigned RSV group tended to have a 
lower starting torque as compared to the PL group, we examined if 
the greater difference in the strength of the RSV group post-training 
could be due at least in part to the lower starting point in this group 
as compared to the PL group, and the RSV group simply caught 
up to the PL group by the post-training measurement. However, we 
observed only small differences from comparing the group means 
from the pre- and post-training data for each subject in each group 
(see Supplementary Results). Thus, the data strongly suggest that 
RSV provided a greater benefit for developing maximal torque as 
compared to the PL treatment in response to exercise in elderly 
subjects.
However, the longer time to peak torque along with no differ-
ences in power or average absolute torque suggests that while RSV 
increased torque production, it may have slowed torque develop-
ment. This conclusion is consistent with the shift towards slower 
myosin heavy chain characteristics of type I fibers (41,42) and the 
approximately 30% greater type I fiber area in vastus lateralis mus-
cles of RSV-treated as compared to PL-treated subjects in the current 
study. Thus, the greater relative area that is comprised of type I fibers 
may account for the lower rate of torque production after exercise 
in the muscles of RSV-treated subjects.
Fiber Area and Satellite Cells
The improvement in muscle function (Figure 1E) suggests a new role 
for RSV-mediated contractile protein accumulation (Figures 2 and 3), 
to regulate at least in part, muscle force and power. Furthermore, 
RSV induced an improvement in fiber cross-sectional area of exer-
cised muscles (Figures 2 and 3). Additional evidence for this adap-
tion is observed by a shift to the right in fiber area-fiber frequency 
histograms (Figures 2 and 3). Of particular interest, type IIA fiber 
area did not improve with exercise in the PL group, but it increased 
in the subjects who consumed RSV and exercised. This contrasts to 
data that showed a RSV-associated blunting of both hypertrophy and 
satellite cell proliferation in muscles of old mice (43). Nevertheless, 
our current results are consistent with data from reloading after atro-
phy in rodents, where improvement in especially type II fiber size was 
reported in animals given RSV (15).
Along with the larger fibers (Figure 4), RSV induced an increase 
in the exercise-associated nuclear and satellite cell numbers (Figure 4). 
While it is clear that muscle satellite cells are critical for successful mus-
cle regeneration/repair (44), the idea that satellite cells are essential for 
increasing fiber size during muscle hypertrophy (45–49) has been chal-
lenged from preclinical rodent models (50). However, it is not necessary 
for RSV to enhance satellite cell proliferation, as RSV could potentially 
contribute to a greater total nuclear pool by reducing apoptotic signal-
ing such as proapoptotic proteins Bax, cleaved caspase 3, and cleaved 
caspase 9 in exercised muscles (15), and therefore reducing the potential 
for elimination of muscle nuclei. As we did not conduct a time course 
evaluation, we do not know if the total satellite cell and nuclear abun-
dance was increased early as a result of hypertrophic adaptations to 
exercise training, or if it were accomplished more slowly and in part by 
eliminating fewer nuclei through apoptotic pathways. The association 
of RSV-mediated increase in fiber size and total myonuclei (satellite cells 
and muscle nuclei) is consistent with the nuclear domain hypothesis, 
but additional time course studies should be conducted to provide a 
better documentation of satellite cell and myonuclei accretion with the 
combined effects of exercise and RSV treatments.
Study Limitations
A potential limitation of this study is that we used a somewhat 
moderate training protocol, where only small or in some cases, no 
changes were noted in the variables that where measured. Thus, we 
cannot rule out the possibility that if we had used a training protocol 
that had been more intensive and had resulted in greater exercise-
induced improvements, that the effects of RSV might have been dif-
ferent than what we report in this study. However, the intensity of 
the exercise protocol that we used in this study is in our opinion, 
more “translationally relevant” than if we had used a more aggres-
sive training protocol similar to that used in other studies. This is 
because our findings will be relevant for average older persons who 
are interested in increasing their physical activity but who are not 
interested in engaging in training at high intensity. However, it is 
exciting to note that even with this modest training approach, we 
saw some very important structural adaptations in muscle to exer-
cise with RSV treatment.

Conclusion
We propose that exercise-initiated an overall improvement in mito-
chondrial function that was linked to improved anabolic signaling 
pathway leading to hypertrophy of type I and IIA fiber sizes, and 
an increase in total muscle nuclei (satellite cells and myonuclei) that 
was enhanced in muscles from RSV-exercised versus PL-exercised 
subjects. The greater fiber sizes account for the RSV-induced eleva-
tion in muscle torque and power. These data support a role for RSV 
treatment combined with exercise as a potential means for reducing 
or reversing sarcopenia in elderly persons.
