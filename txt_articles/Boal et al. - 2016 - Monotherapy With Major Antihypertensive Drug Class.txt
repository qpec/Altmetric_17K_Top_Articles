epression and cardiovascular disease are both common 
disorders and major contributors to the global burden of 
disease. A bidirectional relationship between depression and 
cardiovascular disease is thought to exist mainly because of 
the overlapping pathophysiological processes that underlie 
both conditions.1,2 Bipolar disorder (BD) is associated with a 
1.5- to 2.5-fold increased risk of cardiovascular mortality and 
hypertension,3 whereas major depressive disorder (MDD) has 
a 1.3-fold increased risk of hypertension.4 There is accruing 
data from animal model, epidemiological, and genomic stud-
ies that pathways and molecular targets of commonly used 
antihypertensive drugs may have a role in the pathogenesis or 
course of mood disorders. Genome-wide association studies 
support an association of CACNA1C polymorphism with BD5–8 
and unipolar depression,5,9 implicating dysfunction of L-type 
calcium channels in neuropsychiatric disorders. Because 
L-type calcium channels are the target of the commonly used 
dihydropyridine (DHP) calcium channel blockers (CCB) com-
monly used to treat hypertension, there may be potential impli-
cations in prescribing these drugs in hypertensive patients who 
may have an underlying mood disorder. There is also evidence 
that the brain renin–angiotensin system is involved in proin-
flammatory mechanisms that mainly affect regions responsible 
for emotion, which is implicated in mood states of BDs.10,11 
However, epidemiological evidence for an association between 
any antihypertensive drug and neuropsychiatric consequences 
is inconclusive, and it is unclear whether this relationship is 
because of hypertension per se, its treatment, or both.12–14 In 
this study, we propose to determine whether antihypertensive 
drugs have an impact on mood disorders through the analysis 
Abstract—Major depressive and bipolar disorders predispose to atherosclerosis, and there is accruing data from 
animal model, epidemiological, and genomic studies that commonly used antihypertensive drugs may have a role 
in the pathogenesis or course of mood disorders. In this study, we propose to determine whether antihypertensive 
drugs have an impact on mood disorders through the analysis of patients on monotherapy with different classes of 
antihypertensive drugs from a large hospital database of 525 046 patients with follow-up for 5 years. There were 
144 066 eligible patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria: age 40 to 80 years old at time of antihypertensive prescription 
and medication exposure >90 days. The burden of comorbidity assessed by Charlson and Elixhauser scores showed 
an independent linear association with mood disorder diagnosis. The median time to hospital admission with 
mood disorder was 847 days for the 299 admissions (641 685 person-years of follow-up). Patients on angiotensin-
converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers had the lowest risk for mood disorder admissions, and 
compared with this group, those on β-blockers (hazard ratio=2.11; [95% confidence interval, 1.12–3.98]; P=0.02) and 
calcium antagonists (2.28 [95% confidence interval, 1.13–4.58]; P=0.02) showed higher risk, whereas those on no 
antihypertensives (1.63 [95% confidence interval, 0.94–2.82]; P=0.08) and thiazide diuretics (1.56 [95% confidence 
interval, 0.65–3.73]; P=0.32) showed no significant difference. Overall, our exploratory findings suggest possible 
differential effects of antihypertensive medications on mood that merits further study: calcium antagonists and β-
blockers may be associated with increased risk, whereas angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin 
receptor blockers may be associated with a decreased risk of mood disorders.  (Hypertension. 2016;68:1132-1138.

of patients on monotherapy with different classes of antihyper-
tensive drugs from a large hospital database of 525 046 patients 
with follow-up for 5 years.
Methods
Study Setting and Study Population
The study was conducted on anonymized administrative data from 
2 large secondary care hospitals (Western Infirmary and Gartnavel 
General Hospitals) in the West of Scotland obtained from the 
National Health Service (NHS) Information and Statistics Division 
(ISD).15 These anonymized data are approved for research by the 
NHS ISD committee, and the use of the data was reviewed and 
approved by the Caldicott Guardian (NHS person responsible for 
protecting the confidentiality of patient and service-user informa-
tion and enabling appropriate information sharing). The ISD of the 
NHS in Scotland collects data on all discharges from NHS hospitals 
using the Scottish Morbidity Record scheme. In Scotland, primary 
and secondary health care is provided to all citizens, free at point of 
access, by the NHS. NHS hospitals deliver virtually all elective and 
emergency hospital care. Data from patient case records are used to 
code ≤6 diagnoses at the time of discharge according to the World 
Health Organization Classification of Diseases (ICD-9 before 1996 
and ICD-10 after 1996). The database contains hospital admissions 
and mortality data on 525 046 patients admitted at least once between 
1980 and March 2013. Pharmacy refill prescriptions were available 
from January 2004 onward. The main inclusion criteria were age 40 
to 80 years at prescription start date with a medication duration of 
>90 days. Four mutually exclusive groups based on antihypertensive 
monotherapy were selected: angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibi-
tors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) grouped as 
angiotensin antagonists (AA), β-blockers (BB), CCB, and thiazide 
diuretics (TZ), and a fifth no-antihypertensive therapy (NoAntiHTN) 
group who were not exposed to any of these 4 antihypertensive drug 
classes during the study period. A new prescription was defined if 
the drug was dispensed with at least 3 months of nonreceipt of the 
drug beforehand.
Mood Disorder and Comorbidity Coding
Mental health hospital admissions were available from 1980 to 
March 2013. The diagnoses from the patients’ admissions were 
available from ISD coding using ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes. We ana-
lyzed hospital admissions for major depressive disorders and BDs, 
and these were defined using the ICD-10 classification system. 
Using ICD-10 classification system, a diagnosis of major depres-
sion requires symptoms to be present >2 weeks and must include 
2 key symptoms of low mood, anhedonia, or fatigue along with at 
least 2 other core symptoms. The symptoms of BDs vary between 
patients, but classically patients experience periods of prolonged 
depression alternating with manic episodes. ICD-10 F30-39 codes 
encompassing mood-affective disorder admissions were selected, 
and ICD-9 codes were mapped to these to ensure we included all 
mood disorder admissions (please see Table S1 in the online-only 
Data Supplement for full coding information). Both the primary and 
the secondary diagnoses recorded for each hospital admission were 
included for analysis. Comorbidities at baseline for each subject 
were determined using 2 indices—Charlson (CCI) and Elixhauser 
comorbidity index (ECI) scores. These were calculated using the 
enhanced ICD-9 codes and ICD-10 codes as described in the study 
by Quan et al.16 Because depression is included in Elixhauser index, 
we repeated the analysis using a modified ECI (mECI) score, which 
excluded depression in the scoring. All scores were grouped into 3 
categories 0, 1, and >1 for analysis.
Statistical Analysis
Continuous variables were examined using independent t tests and 
1-way ANOVA and are shown as mean (SD). Categorical variables 
were compared between groups using χ2 tests of association and 
trend where appropriate and are shown as counts and percentages. 
Significance was set at P<0.05.
Multivariable adjusted binary logistic regression was used to de-
termine predictors of mood disorder. Regression models were con-
structed adjusting for age and sex in all models and adding each 
comorbidity score (CCI, ECI, and mECI) separately in different mod-
els. Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine the risk 
of incident hospital admission for mood disorder in the antihyperten-
sive monotherapy and NoAntiHTN groups during a 5-year follow-up. 
The baseline was the date of first prescription of the antihypertensive 
drug and April 1, 2004, for the NoAntiHTN group. Model 1 was ad-
justed for age at baseline and sex, and then, the 3 comorbidity scores 
were then added individually to this original model (models 2–4). 
Fulfillment of proportionality assumptions were checked by inspect-
ing log minus log plots. The referent group was AA for each model. 
We also conducted a sensitivity analysis for MDD only. All analyses 
were performed using SPSS version 20.0.0 (IBM Corp) and R version 
3.2.0 (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing).
Results
Demographic and Clinical Characteristics
After all exclusions, there were 144 066 eligible individu-
als; the study flow chart is presented in Figure. The mean 
age was 55.5 years, and 52% were female patients, and 
there were 299 incident admissions with mood disorders 
(84% MDD, 15% BD, and 1% manic episode, persistent or 
unspecified mood disorder), and of these, 251 were because 
of MDD (Table 2). There were 18 799 deaths during the 
5-year follow-up period. There were 111 936 NoAntiHTN 
subjects and 32 130 patients on monotherapy (AA 33.7%; 
BB 36.1%; CCB 18.3%; and TZ 11.9%). More than half 
the patients had a CCI, ECI, and mECI score of 0 (61.9%, 
53.5%, and 53.8%, respectively).
Comparing the groups with and without an incident 
admission with mood disorder, the group with mood disor-
der admissions were predominantly women (62%) and had a 
higher burden of comorbidities at baseline (Table 1).
Compared with the NoAntiHTN group, the antihyperten-
sive monotherapy groups were older and also had a higher 
burden of comorbidities (Table 2). The AA group had a higher 
proportion of men (56%), whereas TZ was predominantly of 
women (71.5%).
Multivariable adjusted binary logistic regression analysis 
showed a linear increase in odds of mood disorder hospital 
admissions with Elixhauser score irrespective of the inclu-
sion of depression in the calculation of the score and female 
patients had a 1.5-fold increased odds (Hosmer–Lemeshow 
goodness-of-fit P>0.05 for ECI and mECI models, C statis-
tic=0.584 [95% confidence interval: 0.551–0.617]; please 
see Table 3 for ECI and Tables S2 and S3 for CCI and mECI 
models).
Antihypertensive Drugs and Risk of Mood Disorder 
Admission
The median time to mood disorder hospital admission was 
847 days for the 299 admissions (641 684 person-years of 
follow-up). Kaplan–Meier analysis showed that the CCB 
group is associated with the highest risk of mood disorder 
admissions and AA with the lowest (log-rank P=0.006). The 
median time to admission for TZ, BB, NoAntiHTN, CCB, 
and AA were 436.5, 451, 710.5, 744.5, and 933.5 days,

respectively. Kaplan–Meier analysis showed a significant dif-
ference in the survival times between groups (Mantel-Cox 
log-rank test P=0.006).
The results of the multivariable adjusted Cox proportional 
hazards models are presented in Table 4 and in Figure S1 AA 
group was associated with the lowest risk of mood disorder 
admissions. Compared with the AA group, the CCB and 
BB groups were associated with a 2-fold increased risk of 
mood disorder admissions. Interestingly, compared with the 
NoAntiHTN group, AA group showed a 53% decreased risk 
of mood disorder admissions, suggesting a possible protective 
role. The risk associated with TZ did not attain statistical sig-
nificance in any of the models.
Sensitivity Analysis
We repeated the analysis for MDD admissions only. 
Multivariable binary logistic regression analysis showed 
a similar linear increased odds of mood disorder admis-
sions with higher levels of the Elixhauser scores, and female 
patients had a 1.7 increased odds (Tables S4 and S5). In all 
Cox proportional hazards models (Table S6), the AA group 
was again associated with the lowest risk of admission and 
CCB, and BB and NoAntiHTN groups were associated with 
2-fold increased risks of events, although CCB did not reach 
statistical significance in these models.
Discussion
In our exploratory large cohort study, we show that antihy-
pertensive drug classes may have different effects on risk 
of hospital admissions with mood disorder diagnosis. An 
increased risk of mood disorder admissions was associated 
with BB and CCB therapy. Interestingly, we found that ACEi/
ARB therapy had a neutral effect (or reduced risk) on mood 
disorders because this group showed the lowest risk of admis-
sions across all groups including the group that received no 
antihypertensive drugs. We also show that the presence of 
comorbidities significantly increased the risk of mood disor-
ders in the 5-year follow-up period, and this is in line with 
literature indicating individuals with serious mental illnesses 
have an increased number/risk of comorbidities.17–20 Our find-
ing that female patients have an increased risk of mood disor-
der admissions is not novel. It is well established that female 
patients have a 2-fold increased risk of depression21 and pos-
sibly also a higher risk of BD.22

Multiple lines of evidence suggest a role for CCB in 
mental disorders, but no conclusive results have been drawn 
thus far. Mouse models of CCB therapy have shown vari-
able results, but evidence from these models should be 
approached carefully because of differences between spe-
cies such as transport across the blood–brain barrier.12 DHP 
CCB in mouse models of depression have shown promis-
ing evidence of antidepressant effects, with antidepressants 
facilitating this effect, but non-DHP CCBs have been shown 
to lack activity or produce the opposite effect.12 Despite this 
promising evidence, most clinical trials have focused on 
manic phase or rapid cycling BD.12 Clinical studies have 
been underpowered with heterogeneous designs,12 but they 
have found preliminary positive findings with symptom 
improvement with DHP in BD12,23 and depression second-
ary to cerebrovascular disease.24 For example, a recent pilot 
clinical trial by Ostacher et al23 of isradipine in 10 normoten-
sive BD patients showed a promising reduction in depressive 
symptoms with no significant adverse effects despite a high 
drop-out rate. We studied 144 066 individuals and found that 
CCB increased the risk of mood disorder hospital admis-
sion 2-fold in comparison to ACEi/ARB. Our study expands 
on previous research and shows a negative effect of CCB 
in mood disorders in comparison to previous clinical trials. 
However, in our large cohort on monotherapy prescription, 
we investigated incident hospital admissions in comparison 
to changes in symptoms. We also investigated all classes 
of CCB, and as such, we cannot comment on DHP specifi-
cally, but further research could examine the relationship 
between DHP and non-DHP CCBs and hospital admissions. 
It is important to study CCB in neuropsychiatric disorders 
as genome-wide association studies have implicated the 
dysfunction of L-type calcium channels in both BD5–8 and 
unipolar depression,5,9 but the direction of this effect is still 
in question. In addition, there are conflicting results of vera-
pamil and its possible antimanic efficacy, but a recent clini-
cal trial showed that its combination with lithium was highly 
efficacious, whereas monotherapy was not. The authors 
hypothesized that this effect may be because of the additive 
attenuation of protein kinase C.25 Overall, although we showed 
a negative effect of CCB leading to an increase in incident 
hospital admissions, further investigations are required.
We showed BB to be associated with an increase in 
mood disorder admission, which aligns well with depres-
sion being listed as an uncommon side effect of this drug 
class. However, a recent large systematic review in 2002 
showed that BB therapy was not associated with a signifi-
cant increase in reporting depressive symptoms,26 but we 
investigated severe mood disorders requiring hospitalization 
and not symptom reporting. Furthermore, previous research 
from the 20th century found that although propranolol 
use was variably associated with depression, results from

observational studies showed conflicting results. For exam-
ple, one study looking at the incidence of depression with a 
new antihypertensive prescription found no additional risk 
with BB compared with other antihypertensives; however, 
there were limitations such as only achieving modest sta-
tistical power.27 Thiessen et al28 showed that patients newly 
commenced on BB had a higher rate of antidepressant pre-
scriptions compared with diuretics. In contrast to these stud-
ies, our study looked at the more severe end of the spectrum 
of mood disorders requiring hospital admissions where we 
show a clear increase in risk between with BB and CCB. 
Autonomic dysfunction is a proposed mechanism for both 
BD and MDD, and this is reflected by patients having higher 
heart rates and lower heart rate variability, which is known to 
lead to an increased cardiovascular disease risk.29 Recently, 
Taylor29 put forth a suggestion that BB could be considered 
in depression on a case-by-case basis as they reduce heart 
rates while increasing heart rate variability.
Of greater interest is the lower risk for mood disorders 
seen in those on ACEi/ARB monotherapy in our study. People 
with a history of depression have been reported to be at an 
increased risk of dementia,30 and interestingly, antihyperten-
sives targeting the renin–angiotensin system have recently 
shown a possible reduction in the incidence and progression 
of Alzheimer disease.31 A recent systematic review including 
>1 million individuals found that all antihypertensive drugs 
had benefits on overall cognition, with ARB being more effec-
tive than ACEi.32
TZ showed a nonsignificant increased risk of mood 
disorder admission in comparison to ACEi/ARB, and this 
may reflect the low number of events in this group. Further 
studies with larger sample sizes are required to establish 
a detrimental effect of TZ on mood disorders. It is known 
that TZ minimally cross the blood–brain barrier but can 
affect sodium and calcium levels, resulting in psychiatric 
complications.13
Several interacting biological systems might contribute to 
shared pathophysiological mechanisms between mood disor-
ders and cardiovascular disease. These include overactivity of 
the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis,1,33,34 neuroinflamma-
tion, oxidative stress,1 and endothelial dysfunction.1,35 Some of 
these systems, particularly the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal 
axis, may be influenced by antihypertensive medications. 
There is now evidence that the renin–angiotensin system, 
especially in the brain, plays an important role in cognition, 
depression, and behavior and that inhibition of the renin–
angiotensin system may have therapeutic potential in mood 
disorders.36,37
The strengths of this study include the observation of a 
large cohort with longitudinal follow-up data; the ability to 
study groups on monotherapy with different antihyperten-
sive drugs and a large NoAntiHTN group; the availability of 
hospital morbidity data for at least 20 years preceding the 
study start date, enabling an accurate calculation of comor-
bidity scores; and the availability of refill prescription data, 
which is a better marker of patient receipt of the drugs. Our 
study has important limitations. We only investigated the 
incidence of severe mood disorders coded on hospital dis-
charge data, and thus, our results do not include milder lev-
els of mood disorders that are treated in the community. The 
results of our study may be the result of confounding through 
unmeasured covariates, and further validation in independent 
studies is required. The absolute risks for admissions with 
mood disorders are small, and future prospective studies 
should incorporate more granular measures of neuropsychi-
atric evaluation for assessment of outcomes. Our population 
cohort, although large, is derived from 2 large secondary and 
tertiary care hospitals, and hence, the generalizability of our 
findings is unknown, and further studies are needed to vali-
date our results. The global prevalence estimates from the 
WHO for depression and BD are 350 million and 60 million, 
respectively38; thus, it is not surprising that >77% of incident 
admissions in each monotherapy group are because of MDD. 
Through this and our sensitivity analysis, we expect that most 
of our results are driven by MDD, but an effect of CCBs on 
BD outcomes cannot be discounted as we are underpowered 
to comment on this, but we show a direct effect of MDD 
admissions. Adherence and exposure to the drugs and ethnic-
ity of individuals are unknown.
Perspectives
Mental health is an under-recognized area in hypertension 
clinic practice, and our study highlights the importance of 
reviewing mental health diagnoses and progression. Until

validated, it is worthwhile remembering that antihypertensive 
drugs may have an impact on mental health. The neutral effect 
(or reduced risk) exerted by ACEi/ARB could lead to consid-
eration of these drugs in certain subgroups of patients at risk 
of mood disorders.

What Is New?
• Antihypertensive drug classes have a differential effect on hospital ad-
missions for mood disorders. β-Blocker and calcium channel blocker 
therapies seem to be associated with a higher risk for mood disorder 
hospital admissions. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and an-
giotensin receptor blockers may exert a protective effect compared with 
other antihypertensive drugs and no exposure.
What Is Relevant?
• Mental health is under-recognized in hypertension clinical practice, and 
the possible impact antihypertensive drugs has on mental health is im-
portant to be aware of.
Summary
The effect of antihypertensive drug therapy on mental health of 
patients warrants further study.
