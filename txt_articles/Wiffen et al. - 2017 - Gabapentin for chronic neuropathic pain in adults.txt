Background
Gabapentin is commonly used to treat neuropathic pain (pain due to nerve damage). This review updates a review published in 2014,
and previous reviews published in 2011, 2005 and 2000.
Objectives
To assess the analgesic efficacy and adverse effects of gabapentin in chronic neuropathic pain in adults.
Search methods
For this update we searched CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and Embase for randomised controlled trials from January 2014 to January
2017. We also searched the reference lists of retrieved studies and reviews, and online clinical trials registries.
Selection criteria
We included randomised, double-blind trials of two weeks’ duration or longer, comparing gabapentin (any route of administration)
with placebo or another active treatment for neuropathic pain, with participant-reported pain assessment.
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality and potential bias. Primary outcomes were participants with
substantial pain relief (at least 50% pain relief over baseline or very much improved on Patient Global Impression of Change scale
(PGIC)), or moderate pain relief (at least 30% pain relief over baseline or much or very much improved on PGIC). We performed
a pooled analysis for any substantial or moderate benefit. Where pooled analysis was possible, we used dichotomous data to calculate
risk ratio (RR) and number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNT) or harmful outcome (NNH). We assessed the
quality of the evidence using GRADE and created ’Summary of findings’ tables.
Main results
We included four new studies (530 participants), and excluded three previously included studies (126 participants). In all, 37 studies
provided information on 5914 participants. Most studies used oral gabapentin or gabapentin encarbil at doses of 1200 mg or more
daily in different neuropathic pain conditions, predominantly postherpetic neuralgia and painful diabetic neuropathy. Study duration
was typically four to 12 weeks. Not all studies reported important outcomes of interest. High risk of bias occurred mainly due to small
size (especially in cross-over studies), and handling of data after study withdrawal.

Gabapentin for chronic neuropathic pain in adults (Review)

 In postherpetic neuralgia, more participants (32%) had substantial benefit (at least 50% pain relief or PGIC very much improved) with
gabapentin at 1200 mg daily or greater than with placebo (17%) (RR 1.8 (95% CI 1.5 to 2.1); NNT 6.7 (5.4 to 8.7); 8 studies, 2260
participants, moderate-quality evidence). More participants (46%) had moderate benefit (at least 30% pain relief or PGIC much or
very much improved) with gabapentin at 1200 mg daily or greater than with placebo (25%) (RR 1.8 (95% CI 1.6 to 2.0); NNT 4.8
(4.1 to 6.0); 8 studies, 2260 participants, moderate-quality evidence).
In painful diabetic neuropathy, more participants (38%) had substantial benefit (at least 50% pain relief or PGIC very much improved)
with gabapentin at 1200 mg daily or greater than with placebo (23%) (RR 1.7 (95% CI 1.4 to 2.0); NNT 6.6 (5.0 to 10); 6 studies,
1331 participants, moderate-quality evidence). More participants (52%) had moderate benefit (at least 30% pain relief or PGIC much
or very much improved) with gabapentin at 1200 mg daily or greater than with placebo (37%) (RR 1.4 (95% CI 1.3 to 1.6); NNT
6.6 (4.9 to 9.9); 7 studies, 1439 participants, moderate-quality evidence).
For all conditions combined, adverse event withdrawals were more common with gabapentin (11%) than with placebo (8.2%) (RR 1.4
(95% CI 1.1 to 1.7); NNH 30 (20 to 65); 22 studies, 4346 participants, high-quality evidence). Serious adverse events were no more
common with gabapentin (3.2%) than with placebo (2.8%) (RR 1.2 (95% CI 0.8 to 1.7); 19 studies, 3948 participants, moderate-
quality evidence); there were eight deaths (very low-quality evidence). Participants experiencing at least one adverse event were more
common with gabapentin (63%) than with placebo (49%) (RR 1.3 (95% CI 1.2 to 1.4); NNH 7.5 (6.1 to 9.6); 18 studies, 4279
participants, moderate-quality evidence). Individual adverse events occurred significantly more often with gabapentin. Participants
taking gabapentin experienced dizziness (19%), somnolence (14%), peripheral oedema (7%), and gait disturbance (14%).
Authors’ conclusions
Gabapentin at doses of 1800 mg to 3600 mg daily (1200 mg to 3600 mg gabapentin encarbil) can provide good levels of pain relief
to some people with postherpetic neuralgia and peripheral diabetic neuropathy. Evidence for other types of neuropathic pain is very
limited. The outcome of at least 50% pain intensity reduction is regarded as a useful outcome of treatment by patients, and the
achievement of this degree of pain relief is associated with important beneficial effects on sleep interference, fatigue, and depression,
as well as quality of life, function, and work. Around 3 or 4 out of 10 participants achieved this degree of pain relief with gabapentin,
compared with 1 or 2 out of 10 for placebo. Over half of those treated with gabapentin will not have worthwhile pain relief but may
experience adverse events. Conclusions have not changed since the previous update of this review.

Gabapentin for chronic neuropathic pain in adults
Bottom line
There is moderate-quality evidence that oral gabapentin at doses of 1200 mg daily or more has an important effect on pain in some
people with moderate or severe neuropathic pain after shingles or due to diabetes.
Background
Neuropathic pain comes from damaged nerves. It is different from pain messages that are carried along healthy nerves from damaged
tissue (for example, from a fall or cut, or arthritic knee). Neuropathic pain is often treated by different medicines (drugs) to those used
for pain from damaged tissue, which we often think of as painkillers. Medicines that are sometimes used to treat depression or epilepsy
can be effective in some people with neuropathic pain. One of these is gabapentin. Our definition of a good result was someone with
a high level of pain relief and able to keep taking the medicine without side effects making them stop.
Study characteristics
In January 2017 we searched for clinical trials in which gabapentin was used to treat neuropathic pain in adults. We found 37 studies
that satisfied the inclusion criteria, randomising 5914 participants to treatment with gabapentin, placebo, or other drugs. Studies lasted
4 to 12 weeks. Most studies reported beneficial outcomes that people with neuropathic pain think are important. Results were mainly
in pain after shingles and pain resulting from nerve damage in diabetes.
Key results
In pain after shingles, 3 in 10 people had pain reduced by half or more with gabapentin and 2 in 10 with placebo. Pain was reduced
by a third or more for 5 in 10 with gabapentin and 3 in 10 with placebo. In pain caused by diabetes, 4 in 10 people had pain reduced

 by half or more with gabapentin and 2 in 10 with placebo. Pain was reduced by a third or more for 5 in 10 with gabapentin and 4 in
10 with placebo. There was no reliable evidence for any other type of neuropathic pain.
Side effects were more common with gabapentin (6 in 10) than with placebo (5 in 10). Dizziness, sleepiness, water retention, and
problems with walking each occurred in about 1 in 10 people who took gabapentin. Serious side effects were uncommon, and not
different between gabapentin and placebo. Slightly more people taking gabapentin stopped taking it because of side effects.
Gabapentin is helpful for some people with chronic neuropathic pain. It is not possible to know beforehand who will benefit and who
will not. Current knowledge suggests that a short trial is the best way of telling.
Quality of the evidence
The evidence was mostly of moderate quality. This means that the research provides a good indication of the likely effect. The likelihood
that the effect will be substantially different is moderate.

Gabapentin for chronic neuropathic pain in adults (Review)

This is an update of a Cochrane Review titled ’Gabapentin for
chronic neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia in adults’, published
in 2014 (Moore 2014a). The review has now been split and this
update will consider only neuropathic pain. A separate updated
review of gabapentin for fibromyalgia has been published (Cooper
2017).
Earlier versions of this review include ’Gabapentin for chronic
neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia in adults’ (Moore 2011a), and
’Gabapentin for acute and chronic pain’ (Wiffen 2005). That was
itself split out of a review previously published in the Cochrane Li-
braryon’Anticonvulsantdrugsfor acute and chronicpain’ (Wiffen
2000), an update of yet an older systematic review (McQuay
1995).
At a meeting in Oxford in early 2009 with Cochrane’s Editor-in-
Chief, it was decided to create separate chronic pain and acute pain
reviews from the then current review on acute and chronic pain to-
gether (Wiffen 2005). The meeting was in response to controversy
in the USA over the effectiveness of gabapentin as an analgesic
(Landefeld 2009), together with calls for the 2005 review to be up-
dated with the inclusion of unpublished information made avail-
able through litigation (Vedula 2009). It was agreed to update the
2005 review by splitting the earlier one into two components: one
review looking at the role of gabapentin in chronic neuropathic
pain (including neuropathic pain of any cause, and fibromyal-
gia), and a second one to determine the effects of gabapentin in
acute postoperative pain. Other reviews may examine gabapentin
in chronic musculoskeletal pain. The unpublished data were in-
cluded in the 2011 review on chronic neuropathic pain and fi-
bromyalgia (Moore 2011a), and in established acute postoperative
pain (Straube 2010).
This latest update is based on a template for drugs to treat neuro-
pathicpain,usingcurrentstandardsfor Cochrane Reviews, includ-
ing assessment of the reliability of the evidence with GRADE, and
based on criteria for what constitutes reliable evidence in chronic
pain (Moore 2010a; Moore 2013a; Appendix 1).
Description of the condition
Neuropathic pain is a consequence of a pathological maladaptive
response of the nervous system to ’damage’ from a wide variety of
potential causes (Colloca 2017). It is characterised by pain in the
absence of an noxious stimulus, or where minor or moderate noci-
ceptive stimuli evoke exaggerated levels of pain. Neuropathic pain
may be spontaneous (continuous or paroxysmal) in its temporal
characteristics or be evoked by sensory stimuli (dynamic mechan-
ical allodynia where pain is evoked by light touch of the skin).
Neuropathic pain is heterogeneous in etiology, pathophysiology,
and clinical appearance. The 2011 International Association for
the Study of Pain definition of neuropathic pain is “pain caused
by a lesion or disease of the somatosensory system” (Jensen 2011),
based on a definition agreed at an earlier consensus meeting
(Treede 2008). Neuropathic pain is associated with a variety of
sensory loss (numbness) and sensory gain (allodynia) clinical phe-
nomena, the exact patterns of which vary between people and dis-
ease, perhaps reflecting different pain mechanisms operating in an
individual person and, therefore, potentially predictive of response
to treatment (Demant 2014; Helfert 2015; von Hehn 2012). A
new approach of subgrouping people with peripheral neuropathic
pain of different etiologies according to intrinsic sensory profiles
has generated three profiles that may be related to pathophysiolog-
ical mechanisms and may be useful in clinical trial design to enrich
the study population for treatment responders (Baron 2017).
Pre-clinical research hypothesises a bewildering array of possible
pain mechanisms that may operate in people with neuropathic
pain, which largely reflect pathophysiological responses in both
the central and peripheral nervous systems, including neuronal
interactions with immune cells (Baron 2012; Calvo 2012; von
Hehn 2012). Overall, the treatment gains in neuropathic pain, to
even the most effective of available drugs, are modest (Finnerup
2015; Moore 2013b), and a robust classification of neuropathic
pain is not yet available (Finnerup 2013).
Neuropathic pain is usually classified according to the cause of
nerve injury. There may be many causes, but some common causes
of neuropathic pain include diabetes (painful diabetic neuropa-
thy (PDN)), shingles (postherpetic neuralgia (PHN)), amputation
(stump and phantom limb pain), neuropathic pain after surgery
or trauma, stroke or spinal cord injury, trigeminal neuralgia, and
HIV infection. Sometimes the cause is unknown.
Many people with neuropathic pain conditions are significantly
disabled with moderate or severe pain for many years. Chronic
pain conditions comprised five of the 11 top-ranking conditions
for years lived with disability in 2010 (Vos 2012), and are respon-
sible for considerable loss of quality of life and employment, and
increased healthcare costs (Moore 2014a). A US study found the
healthcare costs were threefold higher for people with neuropathic
pain than matched control subjects (Berger 2004). A UK study
and a German study showed a two- to threefold higher level of
use of healthcare services in people with neuropathic pain than
those without (Berger 2012; Berger 2009). For PHN, for exam-
ple, studies demonstrate large loss of quality of life and substantial
costs (Scott 2006; Van Hoek 2009).
In systematic reviews, the overall prevalence of neuropathic pain
in the general population is reported to be between 7% and 10%
(Van Hecke 2014), and about 7% in a systematic review of stud-
ies published since 2000 (Moore 2014a). In individual countries,
prevalence rates have been reported as 3.3% in Austria (Gustorff
2008), 6.9% in France (Bouhassira 2008), and up to 8% in the UK
(Torrance 2006). Some forms of neuropathic pain, such as PDN
and post-surgical chronic pain (which is often neuropathic in ori-
gin), are increasing (Hall 2008). The prevalence of PHN is likely
to fall if vaccination against the herpes virus becomes widespread.

 Estimates of incidence vary between individual studies for partic-
ular origins of neuropathic pain, often because of small numbers
of cases. In primary care in the UK, between 2002 and 2005, the
incidences (per 100,000 person-years’ observation) were 28 (95%
confidence interval (CI), 27 to 30) for PHN, 27 (95% CI, 26 to
29) for trigeminal neuralgia, 0.8 (95% CI, 0.6 to 1.1) for phan-
tom limb pain, and 21 (95% CI, 20 to 22) for PDN (Hall 2008).
Other studies have estimated an incidence of 4 in 100,000 per
year for trigeminal neuralgia (Katusic 1991; Rappaport 1994), and
12.6 per 100,000 person-years for trigeminal neuralgia and 3.9
per 100,000 person-years for PHN in a study of facial pain in the
Netherlands (Koopman 2009). One systematic review of chronic
pain demonstrated that some neuropathic pain conditions, such
as PDN, can be more common than other neuropathic pain con-
ditions, with prevalence rates up to 400 per 100,000 person-years
(McQuay 2007). It is also the case that pains not classified as neu-
ropathic can have neuropathic features. In a community study of
recent joint pain, features of neuropathic pain were common and
were present in over half of those reporting pain of at least mod-
erate severity (Soni 2013).
Neuropathic pain is difficult to treat effectively, with only a mi-
nority of people experiencing a clinically relevant benefit from
any one intervention (Kalso 2013; Moore 2013b). A multidis-
ciplinary approach is now advocated, combining pharmacologi-
cal interventions with physical or cognitive (or both) interven-
tions. The evidence for more invasive interventional therapies
such as neural blockade or intrathecal medication is very weak,
or non-existent (Dworkin 2013). Conventional analgesics such
as paracetamol (acetaminophen) and nonsteroidal anti-inflamma-
tory drugs (NSAID) are not thought to be effective, but without
evidence to support or refute that view (Moore 2015a; Wiffen
2016). Some people may derive some benefit from a topical li-
docaine patch or low-concentration topical capsaicin, although
evidence about benefits is uncertain (Derry 2012; Derry 2014).
High-concentration topical capsaicin may benefit some people
with PHN (Derry 2017). Treatment is often by so-called ’un-
conventional analgesics’ (pain modulators) such as antidepressants
(duloxetine and amitriptyline; Lunn 2014; Moore 2014b; Moore
2015b; Sultan 2008), or antiepileptics (gabapentin or pregabalin;
Moore 2009; Moore 2014b; Wiffen 2013). Evidence for efficacy
of opioids is unconvincing (Derry 2016; Gaskell 2016; Stannard
2016; Wiffen 2015).
The proportion of people who achieve worthwhile pain relief (typ-
ically at least 50% pain intensity reduction; Moore 2014c) is small,
generally only 10% to 25% more than with placebo, with num-
bers needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNT)
usually between 4 and 10 (Kalso 2013; Moore 2013b). Neuro-
pathic pain is not particularly different from other chronic pain
conditions in that only a small proportion of trial participants have
a good response to treatment (Moore 2013b).
The current National Institute for Health and Care Excel-
lence (NICE) guidance for the pharmacological management
of neuropathic pain suggests offering a choice of amitriptyline
(Moore 2012b), duloxetine (Lunn 2014), gabapentin, or prega-
balin (Moore 2009) as initial treatment for neuropathic pain (with
the exception of trigeminal neuralgia), with switching if the first,
second,orthirddrugstriedare noteffective ornottolerated(NICE
2013). This concurs with other recent guidance (Finnerup 2015).
Description of the intervention
Gabapentin is licensed for the treatment of peripheral and central
neuropathic pain in adults in the UK at doses up to 3.6 grams
(3600 mg) daily. It is given orally, usually as tablets or capsules,
but sometimes as an oral solution (50 mg/ml). Guidance suggests
that gabapentin treatment can be started at a dose of 300 mg
per day for treating neuropathic pain. Based on individual patient
response and tolerability, the dosage may be increased by 300 mg
per day until pain relief is experienced or adverse effects make
taking the drug intolerable (EMC 2017). US marketing approval
for gabapentin was granted in 2002 for postherpetic neuralgia; in
Europe, the label was changed to include peripheral neuropathic
pain in 2006. Gabapentin has the trade name NeurontinT M, and
is also available as generic products in some parts of the world.
Gabapentin has a half-life of five to seven hours. It is absorbed
through a saturable transport system, so that absorption is not
linear, and the transporter is found only in the proximal small
bowel. This means that the drug needs to be administered at least
three times daily, and may result in plasma trough levels. Two
new formulations have attempted to improve the availability of
the drug. The first is an extended release, gastro-retentive formu-
lation, designed to provide continuous delivery at the optimal site
of absorption over 8 to 10 hours (Sang 2013). The second uses an
extended-release prodrug (gabapentin encarbil) that is absorbed
through a high capacity transport system found throughout the
intestine, and then undergoes rapid hydrolysis to gabapentin. It
is claimed to provide sustained, dose-proportional gabapentin ex-
posure (Backonja 2011), and can be administered twice daily.
Gabapentin can also be formulated as an aqueous solution for in-
jection. This formulation is not available commercially or licensed
for treatment of any type of neuropathic pain or fibromyalgia.
Gabapentinmisuse hasbeenreported,andthe consequencesdocu-
mented and systematically reviewed (Evoy 2017; Quintero 2017).
How the intervention might work
Gabapentin’s mechanism of action is primarily attributed to its
effect on calcium channels located throughout the peripheral and
central nervous systems, which modify the release of neurotrans-
mitters and reduce excitability of nerve cells (Boyle 2014; Chang
2014). This mode of action confers antiepileptic, analgesic, and
sedative effects. Research also indicates that gabapentin acts by
blocking new synapse formation (Eroglu 2009).

 Why it is important to do this review
Some, but not all, antiepileptics can reduce neuropathic pain (
Wiffen 2010). Gabapentin is an antiepileptic widely prescribed for
neuropathic pain, and it is common practice in some countries to
aim for the maximum tolerated dose. There is growing controversy
over whether this practice is justified by experimental evidence
from double-blind randomised trials. Guidance on prescribing
typically puts gabapentin amongst the first-line agents (Finnerup
2015; NICE2013). Despite thisguidance basedongoodevidence,
prescribing for neuropathic pain often involves paracetamol or
paracetamol combined with opioids (Hall 2013), for which there
is no evidence of efficacy (Wiffen 2016).
The standards used to assess evidence in chronic pain trials have
evolved substantially in recent years, with particular attention be-
ing paid to trial duration, withdrawals, and statistical imputation
following withdrawal, all of which can substantially alter estimates
of efficacy (Appendix 1). The most important change is the move
from using mean pain scores, or mean change in pain scores, to
the number of people who have a large decrease in pain (by at
least 50%) and who continue in treatment, ideally in trials of 8
to 12 weeks’ duration or longer. Pain intensity reduction of 50%
or more correlates with improvements in co-morbid symptoms,
function, and quality of life. These standards are set out in the
PaPaS Author and Referee Guidance for pain studies of Cochrane
Pain, Palliative and Supportive Care (PaPaS 2012).
This Cochrane Review assesses the evidence using methods that
make both statistical and clinical sense, and uses developing crite-
ria for what constitutes reliable evidence in chronic pain (Moore
2010a). Trials included and analysed meet a minimum of report-
ing quality (blinding, randomisation), validity (duration, dose and
timing, diagnosis, outcomes, etc), and size (ideally at least 500 par-
ticipants in a comparison in which the NNT is 4 or above; Moore
1998). This approach sets high standards for the demonstration of
efficacy and marks a departure from how reviews were conducted
previously.

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with double-
blind (participant and observers) assessment of participant-re-
ported outcomes, following two weeks of treatment or longer, al-
though the emphasis of the review was on studies of eight weeks
or longer. We required full journal publication, with the exception
of online clinical trial results summaries of otherwise unpublished
clinical trials, and abstracts with sufficient data for analysis.
We did not include short abstracts (usually meeting reports with
inadequate or no reporting of data). We excluded studies of ex-
perimental pain, case reports, and clinical observations.
Types of participants
We included adult participants aged 18 years and above, with one
or more chronic neuropathic pain condition including (but not
limited to):
1. cancer-related neuropathy;
2. central neuropathic pain;
3. complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) Type II;
4. HIV neuropathy;
5. painful diabetic neuropathy;
6. phantom limb pain;
7. postherpetic neuralgia;
8. postoperative or traumatic neuropathic pain;
9. spinal cord injury;
10. trigeminal neuralgia.
Where we includedstudieswith more thanone type of neuropathic
pain, we analysed results according to the primary condition if
identifiable.
Types of interventions
Gabapentin in any dose, by any route, administered for the relief
of neuropathic pain and compared to placebo or any other active
comparator.
Types of outcome measures
We anticipated that studies would use a variety of outcome mea-
sures, with most studies using standard subjective scales (numer-
ical rating scale (NRS) or visual analogue scale (VAS)) for pain
intensity or pain relief, or both. We were particularly interested
in Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in
Clinical Trials (IMMPACT) definitions for moderate and substan-
tial benefit in chronic pain studies (Dworkin 2008). These were
defined as:
1. at least 30% pain relief over baseline (moderate);
2. at least 50% pain relief over baseline (substantial);
3. much or very much improved on Patient Global Impression
of Change scale (PGIC; moderate);
4. very much improved on PGIC (substantial).
These outcomes concentrate on dichotomous outcomes where
pain responses do not follow a normal (Gaussian) distribution.

Gabapentin for chronic neuropathic pain in adults (Review)

 People with chronic pain desire high levels of pain relief, ideally
more than 50% pain intensity reduction, and ideally having no
worse than mild pain (Moore 2013c; O’Brien 2010).
Primary outcomes
1. Participant-reported pain intensity reduction of 30% or
greater
2. Participant-reported pain intensity reduction of 50% or
greater
3. Patient-reported global impression of clinical change
(PGIC) much or very much improved
4. Patient-reported global impression of clinical change
(PGIC) very much improved
Secondary outcomes
1. Any pain-related outcome indicating some improvement.
2. Withdrawals due to lack of efficacy, adverse events, and for
any cause.
3. Participants experiencing any adverse event.
4. Participants experiencing any serious adverse event. Serious
adverse events typically include any untoward medical
occurrence or effect that at any dose results in death, is life-
threatening, requires hospitalisation or prolongation of existing
hospitalisation, results in persistent or significant disability or
incapacity, is a congenital anomaly or birth defect, is an
’important medical event’ that may jeopardise the patient, or
may require an intervention to prevent one of the above
characteristics or consequences.
5. Specific adverse events, particularly somnolence and
dizziness.
Search methods for identification of studies
Electronic searches
For this update we searched the following databases, without lan-
guage restrictions:
1. Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials
(CENTRAL) via the Cochrane Register of Studies Online
(CRSO), 1 January 2014 to 16 January 2017;
2. MEDLINE via Ovid, 1 January 2014 to 16 January 2017;
3. Embase via Ovid, 1 January 2014 to 16 January 2017.
See Appendix 2 for the CENTRAL search strategy, Appendix 3 for
the MEDLINE search strategy, and Appendix 4 for the Embase
search strategy.
Searching other resources
We reviewed the bibliographies of any RCTs identified and re-
view articles, and searched clinical trial databases (ClinicalTri-
als.gov ( ClinicalTrials.gov) and World Health Organization (
WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform ( ICTTRP)
( apps.who.int/trialsearch/)) to identify additional published or
unpublished data. We did not contact investigators or study spon-
sors.
Data collection and analysis
We performed separate efficacy analyses according to particular
neuropathic pain conditions, and combined different neuropathic
pain conditions in analyses for adverse events and withdrawals
only.
Selection of studies
We determined eligibility by reading the abstract of each study
identified by the search. We eliminated studies that clearly did not
satisfy the inclusion criteria, and we obtained full copies of the
remaining studies. Two review authors made the decisions. Two
review authors (RAM, SD) then read these studies independently
and reached agreement by discussion. We did not anonymise the
studies in any way before assessment. We have provided a PRISMA
flow chart to illustrate the flow of studies (Moher 2009) (Figure
1).

 Data extraction and management
Three review authors (RAM, PW, SD) extracted data indepen-
dently, using a standard data extraction form, and agreed data be-
fore entry into Review Manager (RevMan) 5 (RevMan 2014) or
any other analysis method. We included information about the
pain condition and number of participants treated, drug and dos-
ing regimen, study design, study duration and follow-up, analgesic
outcome measures and results, withdrawals and adverse events
(participants experiencing any adverse event, particular adverse
events, or a serious adverse event).
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
We used the Oxford Quality Score as the basis for inclusion (Jadad
1996), limiting inclusion to studies that were randomised and
double-blind as a minimum.
Two review authors (SD, PW) independently assessed risk of bias
for each study, using the criteria outlined in the Cochrane Hand-
book for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Chapter 8, Higgins
2011), and adapted from those used by Cochrane Pregnancy and
Childbirth, with any disagreements resolved by discussion. We as-
sessed the following for each study:
1. Random sequence generation (checking for possible
selection bias). We assessed the method used to generate the
allocation sequence as: low risk of bias (any truly random
process: random number table or computer random-number
generator); unclear risk of bias (when the method used to
generate the sequence was not clearly stated). We excluded
studies at a high risk of bias that used a non-random process
(odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number).
2. Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection
bias). The method used to conceal allocation to interventions
prior to assignment determines whether intervention allocation
could have been foreseen in advance of, or during, recruitment,
or changed after assignment. We assessed the methods as: low
risk of bias (telephone or central randomisation; consecutively-
numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes); unclear risk of bias (when
method not clearly stated). We excluded studies that did not
conceal allocation and were therefore at a high risk of bias (open
list).
3. Blinding of participants and personnel (checking for
possible performance bias), and blinding of outcome assessment
(checking for possible detection bias). We assessed the methods
used to blind study personnel and participants (all outcomes
were self-assessed) from knowledge of which intervention a
participant received. We assessed the methods as: low risk of bias
(study stated that it was blinded and described the method used
to achieve blinding, for example, identical tablets, matched in
appearance and smell); unclear risk of bias (study stated that it
was blinded but did not provide an adequate description of how
it was achieved). We excluded studies at a high risk of bias that
were not double-blind.
4. Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition
bias due to the amount, nature, and handling of incomplete
outcome data). We assessed the methods used to deal with
incomplete data as: low risk of bias (fewer than 10% of
participants did not complete the study or used ’baseline
observation carried forward’ (BOCF) analysis, or both); unclear
risk of bias (used ’last observation carried forward’ (LOCF)
analysis); or high risk of bias (used ’completer’ analysis).
5. Size of study (checking for possible biases confounded by
small size (Dechartres 2013; Dechartres 2014; Moore 1998;
Nüesch 2010; Thorlund 2011)). We assessed studies as being at
low risk of bias (200 participants or more per treatment arm);
unclear risk of bias (50 to 199 participants per treatment arm); or
high risk of bias (fewer than 50 participants per treatment arm).
Measures of treatment effect
We calculated the number needed to treat for an additional ben-
eficial outcome (NNT) as the reciprocal of the absolute risk re-
duction (ARR) (McQuay 1998). For unwanted effects, the NNT
becomes the number needed to treat for an additional harmful
outcome (NNH) and was calculated in the same manner. We used
dichotomous data to calculate risk ratio (RR) with 95% confi-
dence intervals (CI) using a fixed-effect model unless significant
statistical heterogeneity was found (see below). We did not use
continuous data in analyses.
Unit of analysis issues
The unit of analysis was the individual participant. For cross-over
studies we planned to use first period data where possible, but
otherwise to use available data and consider any potential bias that
this study design presented.
Dealing with missing data
We used intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis where the ITT pop-
ulation consisted of participants who were randomised, took at
least one dose of the assigned study medication, and provided at
least one post-baseline assessment. We assigned zero improvement
(baseline observation carried forward (BOCF)) to missing partic-
ipants wherever possible.
We paid particular attention to methods used for imputation of
missing data due to withdrawals for adverse events and lack of
efficacy.

 Assessment of heterogeneity
We dealt with clinical heterogeneity by combining studies that
examined similar conditions. We assessed statistical heterogeneity
visually (L’Abbé 1987) and with the use of the I2 statistic (Higgins
2003). When the I² value was greater than 50%, we considered
possible reasons for this.
Assessment of reporting biases
The aim of this review was to use dichotomous outcomes of known
utility and of value to people with neuropathic pain (Hoffman
2010; Moore 2010a; Moore 2010b; Moore 2010c; Moore 2014c).
The review did not depend on what the authors of the original
studies chose to report or not, and studies that did not report
dichotomous results for an outcome did not contribute to pooled
analyses for that outcome. We extracted and used continuous data,
which probably reflect efficacy and utility poorly, for illustrative
purposes only.
We assessed publication bias using a method designed to detect the
amount of unpublished data with a null effect required to make
any result clinically irrelevant (usually taken to mean a NNT of
10 or higher in this condition; Moore 2008).
We looked for effects of possible enrichment, either complete
or partial, in enrolment of participants into the studies. En-
richment typically means including participants known to re-
spond to a therapy, and excluding those known not to respond,
or to suffer unacceptable adverse effects, though for gabapentin
no significant effects have been shown from partial enrichment
(Straube 2008). Enrichedenrolmentrandomisedwithdrawal stud-
ies, known to produce higher estimates of efficacy, would not be
pooled (McQuay 2008).
Data synthesis
We used a fixed-effect model for meta-analysis, unless there was
significant clinical heterogeneity and it was still considered appro-
priate to combine studies. In such cases we would use a random-
effects model.
Quality of evidence
Quality of the evidence
We used the GRADE system to assess the quality of the evidence
related to the key outcomes listed in Types of outcome measures,
as appropriate (Appendix 6). Two review authors (RAM, SD) in-
dependently rated the quality of the evidence for each outcome.
We paid particular attention to inconsistency, where point esti-
mates varied widely across studies or confidence intervals (CIs) of
studies showed minimal or no overlap (Guyatt 2011), and poten-
tial for publication bias, based on the amount of unpublished data
required to make the result clinically irrelevant (Moore 2008).
In addition, there may be circumstances where the overall rating
for a particular outcome needs to be adjusted as recommended
by GRADE guidelines (Guyatt 2013a). For example, where there
were so few data that the results were highly susceptible to the
random play of chance, or if a study used last observation carried
forward (LOCF) imputation in circumstances where there were
substantial differences in adverse event withdrawals, one would
have no confidence in the result, and would need to downgrade
the quality of the evidence by three levels, to very low quality. In
circumstances where there were no data reported for an outcome,
we would have reported the level of evidence as very low quality
(Guyatt 2013b).
In addition, we are aware that many Cochrane Reviews are based
largely or wholly on small underpowered studies, and the danger
of making conclusive assessments of evidence based on inadequate
information (AlBalawi 2013; Brok 2009; Roberts 2015; Turner
2013).
’Summary of findings’ table
We have included a ’Summary of findings’ table as set out in
the PaPaS author guide (PaPaS 2012), and recommended in the
Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Chap-
ter 11, Schünemann 2011a). The table includes, where possible,
outcomes equivalent to moderate or substantial benefit of at least
30% and at least 50% pain intensity reduction, PGIC (possibly
at least substantial improvement and at least moderate improve-
ment) (Dworkin 2008), withdrawals due to lack of efficacy, with-
drawals due to adverse events, serious adverse events, and death (a
particular serious adverse event).
For the ’Summary of findings’ table we used the following descrip-
tors for levels of evidence (EPOC 2015):
High: this research provides a very good indication of the likely
effect. The likelihood that the effect will be substantially different
† is low.
Moderate: this research provides a good indication of the likely
effect. The likelihood that the effect will be substantially different
† is moderate.
Low: this research provides some indication of the likely effect.
However, the likelihood that it will be substantially different† is
high.
Very low: this research does not provide a reliable indication of
the likely effect. The likelihood that the effect will be substantially
different† is very high.
† Substantially different: a large enough difference that it might
affect a decision.
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
We planned for all analyses to be according to individual painful
condition, because placebo response rates with the same outcome
can vary between conditions, as can the drug-specific effects (
12
Gabapentin for chronic neuropathic pain in adults (Review)
Copyright © 2019 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 Moore 2009). We also planned subgroup analysis according to
dose of gabapentin, and duration of study if sufficient data were
available.
Sensitivity analysis
In the 2014 review we considered a sensitivity analysis for for-
mulation of gabapentin (standard, gastroretentive, slow-release),
but there were insufficient data for meaningful analysis, and there
were no additional data for these formulations. We planned no
other sensitivity analyses because the evidence base was known to
be too small to allow reliable analysis. Performing analyses that
might inform on which patients were most likely to benefit from
gabapentin treatment would require efficacy data together with
detailed assessment of the exact nature and type of neuropathic
pain at the individual participant level (Tölle 2013). No such data
were expected to be available.
R E S U L T S
Description of studies
Results of the search
In the previous version of this review we considered 36 studies
in 37 reports examining oral gabapentin, involving 5483 partic-
ipants with chronic neuropathic pain in various different condi-
tions, mainly PHN, PDN, or mixed neuropathic pain.
Updated database searches from January 2014 to 17 January 2017
identified 107 potentially relevant reports in CENTRAL, 237 in
MEDLINE, and 484 in Embase. No additional studies were iden-
tified in clinical trials registries or reference lists of included studies
or reviews.
After de-duplication and screening of titles and abstracts, we ob-
tained the full text of seven reports. Of these, we included three
new studies, with 468 participants (Atkinson 2016; Cohen 2015;
Gong 2008). We also identified one report that was a secondary
analysis of a study that was already included (Calkins 2016, see
Zhang 2013), and two reports of pooled analyses of two studies
that were already included (Freeman 2015 and Metha 2016, see
Sang 2013; Wallace 2010).
One study that was previously ongoing has now completed.
We could not identify a published article for this study, but
we did find a synopsis with some results on the pharmaceu-
tical company’s website (NCT00904202). The study satisfied
our inclusion criteria and was therefore included in this re-
view (62 participants). We could not find any updated informa-
tion on the remaining three ongoing studies (Fleckstein 2009;
IRCT201212019014N14; NCT00674687).
We reassessed and excluded one study that had been included in
the earlier review (Ho 2009). This small (18 participants) cross-
over study in small fibre sensory neuropathy used a one-week titra-
tion period, followed by one week at the maximum dose and one
week of wash-out, then crossed over to repeat the sequence with
the other treatment. We excluded it because of the very short treat-
ment periods (only one week at a stable dose), there was some
uncertainty about the dosing schedule (although the maximum
dose was clearly stated), and participants could take additional
gabapentin to a maximum of 1200 mg daily if they required res-
cue medication and paracetamol was inadequate. There was no
information about the use of this additional gabapentin, or how
data from participants using it were analysed. Two further studies
from the previous review are in conditions not now considered
neuropathic pain (Kimos 2007; Van de Vusse 2004).
Figure 1 illustrates the flow of studies for this update.
Included studies
This update therefore includes four additional studies involving
530 participants, bringing the total for the review to 37 studies
involving 5914 participants, although not all of the participants
took all the study medication, and not all the participants were
included in results.
The majorityof studiesinvolvedparticipantswith PHN andPDN.
Otherneuropathicpainconditionsstudiedwere spinal cordinjury,
phantom limb pain, cancer, nerve injury pain, CRPS, HIV, and
radicularlegpain.Fourstudiesenrolledparticipantswith amixture
of types of neuropathic pain.
Four studies (Irving 2009; Sandercock 2012; Sang 2013; Wallace
2010) used a gastroretentive, extended-release formulation of
gabapentin, and four others (Backonja 2011; Harden 2013;
Rauck 2013a; Zhang 2013) used an extended-release prodrug,
gabapentin encarbil.
Twenty-five studies had a parallel-group design and 12 had a cross-
over design (Bone 2002; Gilron 2005; Gilron 2009; Gordh 2008;
Gorson 1999; Harden 2013; Levendoglu 2004; Morello 1999;
Rao 2007; Rintala 2007; Smith 2005; Tai 2002). We used what-
ever data were available from the cross-over studies, including first
period or multiple periods, though there are major issues with
what constitutes the ITT denominator where there are significant
withdrawals.
Parallel-group trials were larger than cross-over trials. The 25 par-
allel-group studies involved 5298 participants (mean 204, median
162 participants, range 26 to 452), while the 12 cross-over stud-
ies involved 621 participants (mean 48, median 40 participants,
range 14 to 120). Not all studies reported the results on an ITT
basis, and this was particularly the case for cross-over studies with
multiple comparisons.
Twenty-eight studies either described enrolment processes that
were not enriched, or had no exclusion criteria that would raise
the possibility of enrichment (Straube 2008). Seven studies were
13

 partially enriched (Caraceni 2004; Irving 2009; Rice 2001; Sang
2013; Serpell 2002) or excluded participants with previous in-
adequate response to treatment with gabapentin or pregabalin
as an exclusion criterion, which may have led to enrichment
(Cohen 2015; Wallace 2010). Two studies enriched for tolerance
to gabapentin, but not response (Backonja 2011; Harden 2013),
which is probably equivalent to partial enrichment. Participants in
these two studies were treated with gabapentin encarbil, a prodrug
of gabapentin; these are analysed alongside the other studies, but
with a view to sensitivity analysis.
Three studies reported using baseline observation carried forward
(BOCF) imputation for the primary outcome (Sandercock 2012;
Sang 2013; Wallace 2010), sometimes alongside last observation
carried forward (LOCF) analyses, and one reported using BOCF
imputation for the responder analyses (Rauck 2013b). Thirty-one
studies either made no mention of an imputation method for miss-
ing data (19) or declared use of LOCF (12). Others performed
analyses on completers only (Atkinson 2016 (for responder analy-
sis); Rintala 2007), and one presented results without imputation
(Rao 2007).
Details of all eligible studies are given in the ’Characteristics of
included studies’ table.
Excluded studies
We excluded 25 studies from this review. The earlier review ex-
cluded 21 studies because they were open-label studies, were stud-
ies in chronic conditions not considered for this review, investi-
gated related acute conditions or preventive strategies, or did not
have an appropriate comparator.
We excluded one new study because it did not have an appropri-
ate comparator and did not appear to be blinded (Ding 2014).
We reassessed and excluded three previously included studies, one
because of its short duration, use of gabapentin as rescue medica-
tion, and unclear methods of analysis (Ho 2009), and two because
definitions of chronic neuropathic pain had changed, and these
two were now outside the current definitions (Kimos 2007; Van
de Vusse 2004).
Risk of bias in included studies
The risk of bias assessments identified that adequate sequence
generation and allocation concealment were often inadequately
reported. Additional risk of bias also derived from studies being
small, and rarely describing how efficacy data were handled on
withdrawal (Figure 2).

 Allocation
All studies were described as randomised, but only 22 adequately
described the method used to generate the random sequence. Only
19 adequately described how the sequence was concealed. We
judged studies with inadequate descriptions at unclear risk, al-
though in most cases the methods were probably adequate but not
reported.
Blinding
All studies were described as double-blind (participants, who also
assessed outcomes, and personnel), but six did not adequately de-
scribe the method used to achieve and maintain blinding (Gorson
1999; Harden 2013; Mishra 2012; Perez 2000; Sandercock 2012;
Simpson 2001). We judged studies with inadequate descriptions
at unclear risk, although in most cases the methods were probably
adequate but not reported.
Incomplete outcome data
We judged four studies at high risk of bias because they reported
only on participants who completed treatment phases (Atkinson
2016; Rintala 2007), did not report groups or reasons for with-
drawal and used LOCF imputation where there was 7% attrition
(Gong 2008), or did not report all expected outcomes in the re-
sults synopsis and used LOCF imputation (NCT00904202). We
judged five studies at low risk of bias for this domain (Rao 2007;
Rauck 2013b; Sandercock 2012; Sang 2013; Wallace 2010), and
the remaining 28 at unclear risk, mainly because they used LOCF
imputation for early withdrawals.
Other potential sources of bias
We judged one study to be at low risk of bias due to study size
(more than 200 participants each treatment arm; Sang 2013),
18 at unknown risk, with between 50 and 200 participants per
treatment arm, and 18 of the included studies at high risk of bias
due to study size smaller than 50 participants per treatment arm.

ies.
Analyses 1.1 to 1.5 show results for the following outcomes: at least
50% reduction in pain (Analysis 1.1; Figure 3); Patient Global
Impression of Change (PGIC) very much improved (Analysis 1.2;
Figure 4); PGIC much or very much improved (Analysis 1.3;
Figure 5); IMMPACT outcome of substantial improvement in
pain (Analysis 1.4; Figure 6); IMMPACT outcome of at least
moderate improvement in pain (Analysis 1.5; Figure 7).

Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN)
Of the 11 studies in PHN, nine (Backonja 2011; Gong 2008;
Irving 2009; NCT00475904; Rice 2001; Rowbotham 1998; Sang
2013; Wallace 2010; Zhang 2013) had a placebo control, and
two (Chandra 2006; Harden 2013) an active control only. All
nine placebo-controlled studies had a parallel-group design, with
study duration of four to 12 weeks; daily gabapentin doses varied
between 1800 mg and 3600 mg, while the dose of gabapentin
encarbil was 1200 mg to 3600 mg daily.
In seven studies reporting the outcome, at least 50% pain intensity
reduction occurred in 33% of participants given gabapentin and
19% of those given placebo by the end of the study, with consid-
21

 erable consistency between studies (Summary of results A; Figure
8). Available data on dosing regimens were too sparse to establish
a dose-response relationship. A number of outcomes consistent
with IMMPACT recommendations for substantial and moderate
benefit were reported in two or more placebo-controlled studies,
and the results showed gabapentin at doses of 1800 mg daily or
more, or gabapentin encarbil at 1200 mg daily, to be more effec-
tive than placebo (Summary of results A). For a PGIC of much
or very much improved, 39% of participants achieved this level
of improvement with gabapentin and 29% with placebo. Other
outcomes are reported in Summary of results A.

 Only two of these studies (Gong 2008; Rice 2001; 24% of par-
ticipants) used a standard formulation of gabapentin, and remov-
ing them from the analysis did not significantly change the re-
sult. Similarly, removing the two studies using gabapentin encarbil
(Backonja 2011; Zhang 2013; 21% of participants) did not affect
the result. There were insufficient data for subgroup analyses based
on dose or duration of studies.
We assessed the quality of evidence as moderate. Results were con-
sistent between studies, but there were uncertainties and differ-
ences between dosing and dosing schedules, formulation, and im-
putation methods used.

In the active controlled study involving 76 participants,
gabapentin at doses of up to 2700 mg daily was compared to nor-
triptyline at doses of up to 150 mg daily over nine weeks. At least
50% improvement in pain over baseline using a VAS pain scale
was achieved by 13/38 (34%) with gabapentin and 14/38 (37%)
with nortriptyline, broadly in line with event rates in placebo-
controlled studies (Chandra 2006). Harden 2013 compared two
dosing regimens of gabapentin encarbil in previous low dose treat-
ment failures and found that about 13% did respond at the 50%
pain reduction level.
Painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN)
Seven of the nine studies in PDN were of parallel-group design
(Backonja 1998; CTR 945-1008; CTR 945-224; Perez 2000;
Rauck 2013a; Sandercock 2012; Simpson 2001); two had a cross-
over design (Gorson 1999; Morello 1999). Eight had a placebo
comparator, while one (Morello 1999) had an active control only.
Seven placebo-controlled parallel-group studies had a study dura-
tion between four and 14 weeks; all but one (Sandercock 2012)
of seven weeks or longer. Daily gabapentin doses varied between
600 mg and 3600 mg; doses below 1200 mg were used in two
studies, 900 mg daily as the only gabapentin dose in one (Gorson
1999), and 600 mg daily in one arm of another (CTR 945-224).
Gabapentin encarbil at doses of 1200 and 3600 mg daily was
compared with pregabalin 300 mg daily and placebo in one study
(Rauck 2013a).
At least 50% pain intensity reduction occurred in 38% of par-
ticipants given gabapentin and 23% of those given placebo by
the end of the study, with considerable consistency between stud-
ies (Summary of results B; Figure 9). Available data on dosing
regimens were too sparse to establish a dose-response relation-
ship. A number of outcomes consistent with IMMPACT recom-
mendations for substantial and moderate benefit were reported in
two or more placebo-controlled studies, and the results showed
gabapentin at doses of 1200 mg daily or more to be more effective
than placebo (Summary of results B). For PGIC much or very
much improved; 50% of participants achieved this level of im-
provement with gabapentin and 30% with placebo. We obtained
very similar results when we omitted data from Simpson 2001
because of concerns one peer reviewer expressed about this study
in a previous version of the review; no other efficacy outcome data
were included from this study. Other outcomes are reported in
Summary of results B.

Gabapentin 600 mg daily produced lesser effects than 1200 mg
and2400mgdailyinastudythatcomparedthem(CTR 945-224).
In one placebo-controlled cross-over study involving 40 ran-
domised participants, moderate or excellent pain intensity reduc-
tion was achieved by 17/40 (43%) with gabapentin 900 mg daily
over six weeks, compared with 9/40 (23%) with placebo (Gorson
1999).

participants,

by 6/21 (29%) with gabapentin and 5/21 (24%) with amitripty-
line (Morello 1999).
Mixed neuropathic pain
One exploratory study (Rauck 2013b) examined the effects of
intrathecal gabapentin in participants with chronic, intractable
non cancer pain, the majority (147/170; 86%) of whom were
classified as having pain of neuropathic or mixed types. Three
different doses (1 mg, 6 mg, and 30 mg daily) were compared
with placebo. There was no significant reduction in group mean
pain scores within and between groups over the 22 day treatment
period. The number of participants experiencing at least 30%

 reduction in pain was 4/42, 4/41, 1/41, and 2/44 for the 1 mg, 6
mg, 30 mg, and placebo groups, respectively.
Four studies examined the effects of oral gabapentin in mixed
neuropathic painful conditions (Gilron 2005; Gilron 2009;
NCT00904202; Serpell 2002); two included participants with
PHN and PDN (Gilron 2005; Gilron 2009); in another the most
common conditions were CRPS and PHN (Serpell 2002); and
the fourth study enrolled participants with PHN, DN, CRPS,
carpel tunnel syndrome, HIV neuropathy, idiopathic sensory neu-
ropathy, and other peripheral neuropathy (proportions not re-
ported, NCT00904202). One had a parallel-group comparison
with placebo over eight weeks (Serpell 2002), and one had a
parallel-group comparison with placebo, lidocaine patch, and
gabapentin in combination with lidocaine patch over five weeks
(NCT00904202). The others had cross-over designs that included
placebo and morphine alone and in combination with gabapentin
over five weeks (Gilron 2005), and nortriptyline alone or in com-
bination with gabapentin over six weeks (Gilron 2009).
One parallel-group comparison with placebo used gabapentin
titrated to a maximum of 2400 mg daily in 305 participants
(Serpell 2002). Only for the PGIC outcome of much or very much
improved was there a significant benefit of gabapentin (Summary
of results C).

The other parallel-group comparison used gabapentin titrated to
1800 mg daily over one week in 62 participants (NCT00904202),
and did not report any of our specified efficacy outcomes. It did
report the group mean change in pain intensity at the end of the
study as 44% for gabapentin alone, 39% for lidocaine patch alone,
50% for the combination, and 26% for placebo (ITT analysis
assumed). The number of participants who were satisfied or very
satisfied with treatment were 65% for gabapentin alone, 69% for
lidocaine patch alone, 69% for the combination, and 64% for
placebo. There were no statistically significant differences between
treatment groups.
One placebo-controlled cross-over study (Gilron 2005) over five
weeks provided results for moderate pain relief for participants
whocompletedagiventreatmentperiod.Gabapentin alone (target
dose 3200 mg daily), morphine alone (target dose 120 mg daily),
and the combination (target dose gabapentin 2400 mg plus 60 mg
morphine daily) were significantly better than placebo (Summary
of results D). These results were calculated from the numbers and
percentages with a moderate response. The total was larger than
the 57 randomised, because some participated in more than one
treatment arm.

The other cross-over study compared gabapentin alone (target

the combination (target dose 3600 mg gabapentin plus 100 mg
nortriptyline daily) over six weeks (Gilron 2009). Pain intensity
was significantly lower with the combination, by less than 1 point
out of 10 on a numerical rating pain scale.

of studies, participants, and events.
Radicular leg pain
One study compared gabapentin, titrated to a maximum of 3600
mg daily, with placebo over 12 weeks in 108 participants, 46 of
whom had radicular pain (Atkinson 2016). Although results were
not reported separately for these participants, the investigators did
report that there was no difference between those with and with-
out radicular pain. In an exploratory analysis of completers, 36%
of participants in both groups reported a 30% or more decrease in
pain intensity, and 26% and 29% reported a 50% or more decrease
with gabapentin (34 participants) and placebo (38 participants),
respectively. There was also no difference between groups for ’pa-
tient estimation of pain improvement’ at the end of the study.
Another study compared gabapentin, titrated to a target of 1800
to 3600 mg daily, with epidural steroid over three months (Cohen
2015). The study reported only group mean decreases in average
and worst leg pain at the end of treatment, which ranged from
1.6 to 2.7, with large variation within groups. There were no
significant differences between the groups.
We assessedthe qualityof evidence asverylowwith a small number

Spinal cord injury
The efficacy of gabapentin in spinal cord injury pain at maximum
doses of 1800 mg or 3600 mg daily was compared with placebo in
three cross-over trials (Levendoglu 2004; Rintala 2007; Tai 2002)
over periods of four and eight weeks. None of the studies reported
dichotomous outcomes equivalent to moderate or substantial pain
relief.
One eight-week study randomised 20 participants to a maxi-
mum of 3600 mg gabapentin daily or placebo over eight weeks
(Levendoglu 2004) and reported a 62% average fall in pain with
gabapentin compared with a 13% fall with placebo.
A second eight-week study randomised 38 participants to a max-
imum of 3600 mg gabapentin daily, amitriptyline 150 mg daily,
or placebo over eight weeks (Rintala 2007). It claimed statistical
superiority for amitriptyline for the 22 participants completing all
three phases, and no benefit of gabapentin over placebo.
The final study comparing gabapentin with placebo over four
weeks in seven participants had no interpretable results (Tai 2002).
We assessedthe qualityof evidence asverylowwith a small number

Nerve injury pain
A single cross-over study evaluated the efficacy of gabapentin at
a maximum of 2400 mg daily compared with placebo over five-
week treatment periods (Gordh 2008). Among the 98 participants
of the 120 randomised who completed both treatment periods,
at least 50% pain intensity reduction was achieved by 13 (13%)
with gabapentin and 9 (9%) with placebo, which did not reach
statistical significance. At least 30% pain intensity reduction was
achievedby29(29%)with gabapentinand19(19%)with placebo,
which did not reach statistical significance.

Phantom limb pain
Two cross-over studies evaluated the efficacy of gabapentin com-
pared with placebo in phantom limb pain (Bone 2002; Smith
2005). Bone 2002 randomised 19 participants to a maximum of
2400 mg gabapentin daily, or the maximum tolerated dose, with
six-week treatment periods. Using an ITT approach, weekly VAS
pain scores were lower at week six only with gabapentin, but not
at any other time, nor with categorical pain measures. Smith 2005
randomised 24 participants to gabapentin titrated to a maximum
daily dose of 3600 mg. A “meaningful decrease in pain” (the top

 of a five-point scale) was achieved by 13 participants (54%) with
gabapentin and 5 (21%) with placebo.

Cancer-related neuropathic pain
Three studies examined gabapentin in the short term in cancer-re-
lated neuropathic pain (Caraceni 2004; Mishra 2012; Rao 2007).
A parallel-group study (Caraceni 2004) randomised 121 partic-
ipants to titration to a maximum of gabapentin 1800 mg daily
or placebo, with 10 days of treatment. The average pain intensity
was somewhat lower with gabapentin than with placebo, but the
number of participants described as having pain under control was
very similar with both treatments after six days, with 50% to 60%
with pain under control over six to 10 days. A cross-over study
(Rao 2007) compared gabapentin titrated to 2700 mg daily with
placebo in chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain over three
weeks. There was no significant difference between gabapentin
and placebo, but the study did recruit participants both with pain
or sensory loss or paraesthesia, and baseline pain scores were only
about 4/10 on a numerical rating scale. The study probably lacked
sensitivity to detect any difference.
The third study compared gabapentin 1800 mg daily with prega-
balin 600 mg daily and amitriptyline 100 mg daily for a total of
four weeks (Mishra 2012). No dichotomous data were reported; a
decrease in pain scores in all groups in all weeks was reported, to-
gether with a morphine-sparing effect and improvement in func-
tional capacity. Morphine-sparing and functional capacity were
significantly better with pregabalin than the other treatments.

HIV-associated sensory neuropathies
A single parallel-group study compared gabapentin titrated to
2400 mg daily with placebo over four weeks in 24 participants
with painful HIV-associated neuropathies (Hahn 2004). On av-
erage, pain and sleep improved substantially with both gabapentin
and placebo, though the time courses differed. After four weeks,
there was no difference in median pain scores, though the placebo
response had an unusual time course in 11 participants.

Withdrawals (see Summary of results E)
We pooled data from participants with different types of neuro-
pathic pain for analyses of withdrawals.
All-cause withdrawals
Twenty-two studies with 4617 participants reported on with-
drawals for any cause, which occurred in 20% of participants with
gabapentin at daily doses of 1200 mg or more, and in 19% with
placebo (Analysis 2.1). The risk ratio was 1.0 (0.92 to 1.2). The
NNH was not calculated.
Adverse event withdrawals
Twenty-two studies with 4346 participants reported on adverse
event withdrawals, which occurred in 11% of participants with
gabapentin at daily doses of 1200 mg or more, and in 8.2% with
placebo (Analysis 2.2). The risk ratio was 1.4 (1.1 to 1.7), and the
NNH was 30 (20 to 66).
Lack of efficacy withdrawals
Fifteen studies with 3559 participants reported on lack of effi-
cacy withdrawals, which occurred in 1.9% of participants with
gabapentin at daily doses of 1200 mg or more, and in 3.3% with
placebo (Analysis 2.3). The risk ratio was 0.57 (0.37 to 0.88), and
the number needed to treat to prevent one withdrawal (NNTp)
NNTp was 73 (41 to 360).
We assessed the quality of evidence for withdrawals as high, based
on a reasonable number of events and generally good reporting.
Adverse events (see Summary of results E)
We pooled data from participants with different types of neuro-
pathic pain for analyses of adverse events.
Participants experiencing at least one adverse event
Eighteen studies with 4279 participants reported on participants
experiencing at least one adverse event, which occurred in 63% of
participants with gabapentin at daily doses of 1200 mg or more,
and in 49% with placebo (Analysis 3.1). The risk ratio was 1.3
(1.2 to 1.4), and the NNH was 7.5 (6.1 to 9.6). We assessed the
quality of evidence as moderate, based on a reasonable number
of events and consistency, but limited quality of reporting adverse
events.
Serious adverse events
NIneteen studies reported on 3948 participants experiencing a
serious adverse event, which occurred in 3.2% of participants with
gabapentin at daily doses of 1200 mg or more, and in 2.8% with
placebo (Analysis 3.2). The risk ratio was 1.2 (0.83 to 1.7). The
NNH was not calculated. We assessed the quality of evidence as
moderate due to the limited number of events.

 Particular adverse events
Somnolence, drowsiness, or sedation was reported as an adverse
event in 20 studies with 4288 participants, and it occurred in 14%
of participants with gabapentin at doses of 1200 mg daily or more,
and in 5.2% with placebo (Analysis 3.3). The risk ratio was 2.8
(2.3 to 3.5), and the NNH was 11 (9.4 to 14).
Dizziness was reported as an adverse event in 21 studies with
4739 participants, and it occurred in 19% of participants with
gabapentin at doses of 1200 mg daily or more, and in 6.6% with
placebo (Analysis 3.4). The risk ratio was 2.9 (2.4 to 3.4), and the
NNH was 8.0 (7.0 to 9.4).
Peripheral oedema was reported as an adverse event in 12 studies
with 3325 participants, and it occurred in 6.7% of participants
with gabapentin at doses of 1200 mg daily or more, and in 1.7%
with placebo (Analysis 3.5). The risk ratio was 4.1 (2.7 to 6.4),
and the NNH was 20 (16 to 27).
We assessedthe qualityof evidence forthese outcomesasmoderate.
While there was a reasonable number of events, definitions of
adverse events and reporting was not consistent.
Ataxia or gait disturbance was reported as an adverse event in four
studies with 510 participants. It occurred in 14% of participants
with gabapentin at doses of 1200 mg daily or more, and in 2.6%
with placebo (Analysis 3.6). The risk ratio was 5.5 (2.5 to 12), and
the NNH was 8.5 (6.1 to 14).
We assessed the quality of evidence for ataxia as low. There was a
small number of studies and events.

 Death
Deaths were rare in these studies. Five deaths occurred in PHN
studies; three with placebo: one in 231 participants (Sang 2013),
one in 116 (Rowbotham 1998) and one in 133 (Wallace 2010);
two with gabapentin: one in 223 participants (Rice 2001),
and one in 107 (Irving 2009). An unpublished study (CTR
945-1008) reported two deaths: one of 200 participants treated
with gabapentin, and one of 189 treated with placebo. A fur-
ther study reported two deaths in 152 participants taking placebo
(Serpell 2002). Overall, three deaths occurred with gabapentin
and five with placebo. We assessed the quality of evidence as very
low due to the very small number of events.

Gabapentin for chronic neuropathic pain in adults (Review)
Copyright © 2019 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 D I S C U S S I O N
Summary of main results
Gabapentin is a reasonably effective treatment for a variety of
neuropathic pain conditions. It has been demonstrated to be bet-
ter than placebo across all studies for IMMPACT outcomes of
substantial and at least moderate improvement, producing almost
identical results for all trials and those in parallel-group studies last-
ing six weeks or longer. Numbers needed to treat for an additional
beneficial outcome (NNTs) were between 5 and 7 for substantial
and at least moderate improvement in PHN and PDN (moderate-
quality evidence). Results were consistent across the major neuro-
pathic pain conditions tested, though gabapentin was tested only
in small numbers in uncommon neuropathic pain conditions. The
review concentrated on doses of gabapentin of 1200 mg daily or
greater, though a wide range of fixed doses and dose titration reg-
imens were used.
Gabapentin was tested in nine different chronic pain conditions
generally considered to be neuropathic in origin. For only three
neuropathic pain conditions was there sufficient information to be
confident that it worked satisfactorily, namely PHN, PDN, and
mixed neuropathic pain, itself principally, though not exclusively,
PHN and PDN.
Benefit was balanced by more withdrawals due to adverse events
(high-quality evidence), and participants taking gabapentin ex-
perienced more adverse events (high-quality evidence), including
somnolence, dizziness, peripheral oedema, and gait disturbance
than did those taking placebo (moderate-quality evidence). Seri-
ous adverse events were no more common with gabapentin than
placebo (moderate-quality evidence), and death was an uncom-
mon finding in these studies (very low-quality evidence).
Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
Efficacyandadverse eventoutcomeswere notconsistentlyreported
across the studies, and this limited the analyses to some extent.
However, for the most important efficacy and adverse event out-
comes, analyses across all conditions were mostly based on between
1000 and about 4700 participants. All the larger studies (typically
those with more than 100 participants) reported some efficacy
outcome equivalent to one or both of the IMMPACT outcomes
of at least moderate or substantial benefit. Clearly, analysis at the
level of the individual participant would facilitate a more robust
estimate (Moore 2013a). Such analysis can also demonstrate a link
between benefit in terms of pain and benefit in other outcomes,
including quality of life (Hoffman 2010).
Possible sources of bias that could have affected the results of the
review included the following.
• Duration - NNT estimates of efficacy in chronic pain
studies tend to increase (get worse) with increasing duration
(Moore 2010e). However, limiting studies to those of six weeks
or longer did not change the main efficacy outcomes, mainly
because most participants were in longer-duration studies.
• Outcomes may affect estimates of efficacy, but the efficacy
outcomes chosen were of participants achieving the equivalent of
IMMPACT-defined moderate or substantial improvement, and
it is likely that lesser benefits, such as ’any benefit’ or ’any
improvement’, are potentially related to lesser outcomes, though
this remains to be clarified.
• The dose of gabapentin used differed between studies, in
terms of maximum allowable dose, and whether the dose was
fixed, titrated to effect, or titrated up to the maximum
irrespective of beneficial or adverse effects. We chose to pool data
irrespective of dose, within broad limits, because it was the only
practical way to deal with dose in a pooled analysis, and because
of a lack of good evidence of any clear dose-response effect for
gabapentin in neuropathic pain.
• In some circumstances cross-over trials have been shown to
exaggerate treatment effects in comparison with parallel-group
designs (Khan 1996), but the extent is unclear, and it is unlikely
to be the source of major bias (Elbourne 2002). Withdrawals
from cross-over studies meant that any results were likely to be
per protocol for completers rather than a true ITT analysis.
Parallel-group studies were larger than cross-over studies, and
dominated the analyses in terms of number of participants. The
25 parallel-group studies involved 5298 participants (median
204), while the 12 cross-over studies involved 621 participants
(median 40 participants). Additionally, few cross-over studies
reported outcomes that could be used in the analyses.
• The absence of publication bias (unpublished trials showing
no benefit of gabapentin over placebo) can never be proven.
However, we can calculate the number of participants in studies
of zero benefit (risk ratio of 1) required for the absolute benefit
to reduce beneficial effects to a negligible amount (Moore 2008).
If an NNT of 10 were considered a level that would make
gabapentin clinically irrelevant, then the number of participants
with zero benefit would be 2448 for a moderate response and
1113 for a substantial response in PHN, and 741 for a moderate
response and 887 for a substantial response in PDN. With
median study size for parallel-group studies of about 200
participants, this would require a minimum of seven unavailable
studies in PHN and four in PDN. While not impossible, this
seems unlikely given the paucity of new data in the last three
years.
There isone importantunknownformoststudies,namelywhether
the definition of response in the trials included only partici-
pants who had both an analgesic response and were able to take
gabapentin. If response included an LOCF assessment of efficacy
from those who discontinued, this could have affected the results
(Moore 2012a). LOCF tends to overestimate treatment effects
when adverse event withdrawals with drug are higher than that
with placebo. For gabapentin, the excess adverse withdrawal over
placebo was about 3%. This is not likely to result in significant

 overestimationintreatmenteffect(Moore 2012a). Inasimilarsitu-
ation, duloxetine produced little different NNTs using LOCF and
BOCF in four different chronic pain conditions (Moore 2014b).
Another issue is how to deal with relatively short term, small,
multiple cross-over studies that intensively study participants on
a daily basis (Gilron 2005; Gilron 2009), and do not report out-
comes of clinical relevance (participants with adequate pain re-
lief), but rather average pain scores, whose relevance has been
questioned because of underlying skewed distributions (McQuay
1996; Moore 2010a; Moore 2013a). This study design can provide
useful and clinically relevant information, such as the relatively
rapid onset of effect of therapies in neuropathic pain, or how indi-
vidual patients respond to several different drugs. However, they
are difficult to include in pooled analyses, and their small size and
brevity come with significant potential biases. Small size has be-
come a particular issue, with increasing association of small study
size with positive bias (Dechartres 2013; Dechartres 2014; Fanelli
2017; Nguyen 2017). Cochrane Reviews have received criticism
for being overly confident with inadequate data (AlBalawi 2013;
Brok 2009; Roberts 2015; Turner 2013).
There were almost no data for direct comparisons with other active
treatments. It is questionable how important direct comparisons
may be; they compare average efficacy rates between different ac-
tive therapies, but individual people may respond to one drug, but
not another (Moore 2013b).
Finally, there was no way to incorporate into the review impor-
tant observations on the timing and consistency of analgesia with
gabapentin in neuropathic pain. In PHN, individual participant-
level pooled analyses of several large trials have demonstrated that,
judged by the proportion of participants with a 1 out of 10 point
pain intensity reduction, around 20 to 40 days is needed for effects
to be seen (Rauck 2013c). Early response, defined as a 30% pain
intensity reduction or greater, was predictive of response after 10
weeks, while pain intensity reduction of less than 10% at week 5
was the best early predictor of lack of response at week 10 (Jensen
2012).
While there was considerable information about withdrawals and
adverse events, rare but serious adverse events could not be ad-
dressed in these studies. We are aware that erectile dysfunction has
been a cause for concern for younger men treated with antiepilep-
tic drugs for epilepsy (Smalldone 2004), and anorgasmia has been
reported with gabapentin (Perloff 2011). Adverse event reporting
of erectile dysfunction or anorgasmia in these trials was sparse or
not present, and the effects of gabapentin on sexual function may
not be well represented. Moreover, the included studies did not
address gabapentin misuse (Evoy 2017; Quintero 2017).
Quality of the evidence
The studies included in this review covered a large number of dif-
ferent painful conditions. The main quality issues involve report-
ing of outcomes of interest, particularly dichotomous outcomes
equivalent to IMMPACT, appropriate analysis of data for par-
ticipants who withdrew, and better reporting of adverse events.
The earliest study was published in 1998, and the past decade or
so has seen major changes in clinical trial reporting. The studies
themselves appear to be well-conducted, and individual partici-
pant analysis could overcome some of the shortcomings of report-
ing.
Potential biases in the review process
We know of no potential biases in the review process.

Gabapentin for chronic neuropathic pain in adults (Review)

 Other systematic reviews
A number of guidelines based on systematic reviews have con-
cluded that gabapentin is helpful in neuropathic pain (Finnerup
2015; Moulin 2014; NICE 2013; SIGN 2013). In PHN, a sys-
tematic review found that higher gabapentin doses may not pro-
vide greater benefit, but may increase the risk of adverse events
(Wang 2017).
One other review has provided NNTs for gabapentin in different
neuropathic pain conditions based on 50% pain relief, quoting
NNTs of 4.7 and 4.3 for neuropathic pain and peripheral pain,
and 4.6 for PHN and 3.9 for PDN (Finnerup 2005). A systematic
review of therapies for PHN considered gabapentin effective, with
an NNT of 4.6 (Hempenstall 2005). These efficacy estimates are
more optimistic than NNTs for the IMMPACT substantial bene-
fit calculated for this review, and more optimistic than NNTs cal-
culated for the same outcome of at least 50% pain relief for PHN
of 5.7 and PDN of 5.8. The use of more stringent criteria for ef-
ficacy, and availability of more information from longer duration
studies has led to more conservative efficacy results. Both prega-
balin and duloxetine have NNTs in the region of 5 to 6 for at least
50% pain relief over eight to 12 weeks compared with placebo in
PHN and PDN (Lunn 2009; Moore 2009; Sultan 2008).
A numberof othersystematicreviewshave examinedthe efficacyof
gabapentin in neuropathic pain. Systematic reviews of gabapentin
for neuropathic pain in spinal cord injury (Tzellos 2008) and fi-
bromyalgia (Hauser 2009; Tzellos 2010) found no more studies
than those reported here. An examination of the effects of en-
riched enrolment found no more studies, and gave similar results
for withdrawals and adverse events based on a more limited data
set (Straube 2008). A review comparing gabapentin and duloxe-
tine in PDN was limited to two gabapentin studies, was statisti-
cal in nature, and restricted to average changes in some efficacy
parameters (Quilici 2009). The most directly relevant review was
a comparison between gabapentin and tricyclic antidepressants
(Chou 2009), in which a meta-analysis of six placebo-controlled
gabapentin studies in PHN, PDN, and mixed neuropathic pain
was performed. Using a mixture of outcomes the relative bene-
fit compared with placebo was 2.2, similar to the benefits found
for the ’all studies’ analysis and for analyses for PHN, PDN, and
mixed neuropathic pain in this review. Phillips 2010 examined the
same single study of gabapentin (Hahn 2004) as part of a wider
review of pharmacological interventions for HIV neuropathy and
came to similar conclusions. The UK NICE guidance on pharma-
cological management of neuropathic pain has gabapentin as one
of four drugs to try initially, with early switching if pain relief is
not forthcoming (NICE 2013).
One further review in the public domain (Perry 2008) was per-
formed as part of a legal case in the USA ending in 2009. Perry
2008 considered similar outcomes to this review; NRS or VAS
pain score was given hierarchical priority between 50% or greater
reduction in pain score (higher priority) and PGIC (lower prior-
ity) mainly because it was the pre-defined primary end point in al-
most all studies, and for some studies it was difficult to determine
how the secondary endpoints were manipulated during post hoc
changes in statistical analysis plans. The Perry conclusions are very
similar to those of the present review. The likely real differences
would lie in the fact that Perry excluded Perez 2000 and Simpson
2001, and did not have access to Sandercock 2012, Irving 2009,
and Wallace 2010.
Perry’s conclusion on effectiveness was a clinical judgement based
on balancing NNH against NNT, using the Cochrane Glossary
definition of effectiveness, and presuming that inherent biases in
the studies (enrichment, exclusion of many typical real world pa-
tients) implied that on balance the benefit of gabapentin use on
average does not exceed the harm, which is a somewhat different
issue than addressed by this Cochrane Review.

Implications for practice
For people with neuropathic pain
Gabapentin at a dose of 1800 to 3600 mg daily (1200 to 3600
mg gabapentin encarbil) can provide good levels of pain relief to
some people with postherpetic neuralgia and peripheral diabetic
neuropathy. Evidence for other types of neuropathic pain is very
limited. The outcome of at least 50% pain intensity reduction is
regarded as a useful outcome of treatment by people with chronic
neuropathic pain, and the achievement of this degree of pain relief
isassociatedwith importantbeneficial effectson sleepinterference,
fatigue, and depression, as well as quality of life, function, and
work. Around 3 to 4 out of 10 achieved this degree of pain relief
with gabapentin, compared with 1 to 2 out of 10 for placebo. Over
half of those treated with gabapentin will not have worthwhile
pain relief.
For clinicians
Gabapentin at a dose of 1800 to 3600 mg daily (1200 to 3600
mg gabapentin encarbil) can provide good levels of pain relief to
some people with postherpetic neuralgia and peripheral diabetic
neuropathy. Evidence for other types of neuropathic pain is very
limited. No evidence regarding a dose-response effect was available
for doses above 1200 mg daily, but limited evidence suggested that
doses lower than 1200 mg daily were less effective. Over half of
those treated with gabapentin will not have worthwhile pain relief.
For policy makers
Gabapentin at a dose of 1800 to 3600 mg daily (1200 to 3600
mg gabapentin encarbil) can provide good levels of pain relief to
some people with postherpetic neuralgia and peripheral diabetic
neuropathy. Evidence for other types of neuropathic pain is very
limited. The level of efficacy found for gabapentin is consistent

Implications for research
General
The design of studies in neuropathic pain, and the outcomes, are
well understood, but as the number of people experiencing good
pain relief with gabapentin over the longer term (12 weeks) is
likely to be small, an enriched-enrolment randomised-withdrawal
(EERW) design might provide the highest sensitivity to detect a
signal (Moore 2015c). Since combination therapy for neuropathic
pain has been reported to be more effective than monotherapy
with any drug (Chaparro 2012), and combination therapy is com-
mon clinical practice, studies examining gabapentin in combina-
tion with an antidepressant could be of interest. Combinations
with strong opioids are likely to be used less, owing to their limited
efficacy and known harms. More interesting might be the com-
bined use of gabapentin with tricyclic antidepressants, weak opi-
oids, or tramadol, and examination of the timings and sequencing
of these drugs with gabapentin.
More research is warranted into the efficacy of gabapentin in
painful neuropathic pain conditions where there is currently in-
adequate information. These conditions tend to be uncommon,
and studies can be difficult, with few possible participants.
Design
Reporting of clinically relevant outcomes using appropriate impu-
tation for withdrawal would improve the relevance of the findings
for clinical practice. The use of EERW designs for comparison
with classic trial designs indicates that good quality EERW designs
of long duration may be appropriate for neuropathic pain.
Stratification by phenotype might be an interesting possibility for
future studies (Baron 2017), as well as the possibility of measur-
ing pain scores with activity (including dynamic tactile allodynia)
versus at rest or on average/worst/best over prior 24 hours. Partic-
ipant-level data might be of importance in identifying responder
clusters and characteristics.
While pain is important, other outcomes relating to function,
sleep, fatigue, and quality of life are also important, and are prob-
ably closely linked (Hoffman 2010). Participant-level data could
shed light on these relationships.
The main issue, though, is not whether gabapentin is effective, but
how best to use it in clinical practice to generate the best results
for most people with a chronic neuropathic pain condition, in the
shortest time, and at the lowest cost. New study designs have been
proposed to examine this (Moore 2010f).
Measurement (endpoints)
Assessment of neuropathic pain and other symptoms should be
based on dichotomous participant-reported outcomes of proven
clinical utility.
Comparison between active treatments
There seems little point in comparing gabapentin directly with
other treatments; the issue is what works for whom.

 Serpell 2002
Methods
Multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel groups, partial en-
richment. No imputation method mentioned. Participants withdrawing due to lack of
efficacy were defined as non-responders (n = 6), but treatment of substantial AE with-
drawals (n = 49) and all-cause withdrawals (n = 73) not reported
Titration over 5 weeks from 900 mg daily until pain controlled, or to maximum of 2400
mg daily, then fixed dose (8 weeks in total)
Participants
Mixed neuropathic pain, most common conditions were CRPS (28%), PHN (14%). PI
at randomisation ≥ 4/10
Excluded: individuals who had previously failed to respond to gabapentin at ≥ 900 mg
daily, or had experienced intolerable side effects at any dose
N = 305
Median age 57 years, 53% women
Initial mean pain score 7.2/10
Interventions
Gabapentin 2400 mg daily (max), n = 153
Placebo, n = 152
101 took 2400 mg, 189 took 1800 mg, 27 took 900 mg
Stable antidepressant therapy and NSAID/opioid therapy for other conditions allowed
Paracetamol 500 mg/codeine 30 mg or paracetamol 500 mg (max 8 tablets daily) allowed
as rescue medication

Appendix 1. Methodological considerations for chronic pain
There have been several changes in how the efficacy of conventional and unconventional treatments is assessed in chronic painful
conditions. The outcomes are now better defined, particularly with new criteria for what constitutes moderate or substantial benefit
(Dworkin 2008); older trials may only report participants with ’any improvement’. Newer trials tend to be larger, avoiding problems
from the random play of chance. Newer trials also tend to be of longer duration, up to 12 weeks, and longer trials provide a more
rigorous and valid assessment of efficacy in chronic conditions. New standards have evolved for assessing efficacy in neuropathic pain,
and we are now applying stricter criteria for the inclusion of trials and assessment of outcomes, and are more aware of problems that
may affect our overall assessment. To summarise some of the recent insights that must be considered in this new review:
1. Pain results tend to have a U-shaped distribution rather than a bell-shaped distribution. This is true in acute pain (Moore
2011b), back pain (Moore 2010d), and arthritis (Moore 2010e), as well as in fibromyalgia (Straube 2010); in all cases average results
usually describe the experience of almost no-one in the trial. Data expressed as averages are potentially misleading, unless they can be
proven to be suitable.
2. As a consequence, we have to depend on dichotomous results (the individual either has or does not have the outcome) usually
from pain changes or patient global assessments. The Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials
(IMMPACT) group has helped with their definitions of minimal, moderate, and substantial improvement (Dworkin 2008). In
arthritis, trials of less than 12 weeks’ duration, and especially those shorter than eight weeks, overestimate the effect of treatment
(Moore 2010d); the effect is particularly strong for less effective analgesics, and this may also be relevant in neuropathic-type pain.
3. The proportion of people with at least moderate benefit can be small, even with an effective medicine, falling from 60% with an
effective medicine in arthritis to 30% in fibromyalgia (Moore 2009; Moore 2010d; Moore 2010e; Moore 2013b; Moore 2014b;

 Straube 2008; Sultan 2008). One Cochrane Review of pregabalin in neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia demonstrated different
response rates for different types of chronic pain (higher in diabetic neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia and lower in central pain
and fibromyalgia) (Moore 2009). This indicates that different neuropathic pain conditions should be treated separately from one
another, and that pooling should not be done unless there are good reasons for doing so.
4. Individual patient analyses indicate that people who get good pain relief (moderate or better) have major benefits in many other
outcomes, affecting quality of life in a significant way (Moore 2010c; Moore 2014b).
5. Imputation methods such as last observation carried forward (LOCF), used when participants withdraw from clinical trials, can
overstate drug efficacy especially when adverse event withdrawals with drug are greater than those with placebo (Moore 2012a).

Appendix 6. GRADE: criteria for assigning grade of evidence
The GRADE system uses the following criteria for assigning a quality level to a body of evidence (Cochrane Handbook of Systematic
Reviews of Interventions, Chapter 12, Schünemann 2011b).
1. High: randomised trials; or double-upgraded observational studies
2. Moderate: downgraded randomised trials; or upgraded observational studies
3. Low: double-downgraded randomised trials; or observational studies
4. Very low: triple-downgraded randomised trials; or downgraded observational studies; or case series/case reports
Factors that may decrease the quality level of a body of evidence are:
1. limitations in the design and implementation of available studies suggesting high likelihood of bias;
2. indirectness of evidence (indirect population, intervention, control, outcomes);
3. unexplained heterogeneity or inconsistency of results (including problems with subgroup analyses);
4. imprecision of results (wide confidence intervals);
5. high probability of publication bias.
Factors that may increase the quality level of a body of evidence are:
1. large magnitude of effect;
2. all plausible confounding would reduce a demonstrated effect or suggest a spurious effect when results show no effect;
3. dose-response gradient.

Comment: Written by Michael Chan BSc(Pharm), Danielle Ghag BSc(Pharm), Aaron Tejani PharmD
Dear Cochrane Review Team,
We read with great interest the systematic review of Gabapentin for chronic neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia in adults by Moore
2014. Although this systematic review has taken on the arduous task of ascertaining the highest level of available evidence, it is made
difficult by the inherent bias that plagues the trials in the literature. This was evidenced upon further analysis of the 6 trials that were
included in outcome 1.1, “At least 50% pain reduction over baseline”. The results of this outcome were subject to the limitations of
the methodology in these studies that were not adequately accounted for in this review article.
The five-point Oxford Scale was included for each study to assess the risk of bias. This scale has been shown to provide unreliable
validity assessments and its use is discouraged because it does not address important biases such as allocation concealment. Moreover,
since gabapentin has a profound side effect profile, participants may have correctly anticipated which treatment they received. Thus, we
feel that blinding is not adequately assessed through the Oxford scale, as points are allocated for double blinding without considering
whether blinding was maintained throughout the study. In these cases, the risk of bias due to blinding may be better represented as an
unclear risk or as some may argue, high risk. This would lead to reclassification of Sang 2013, Wallace 2010 and Zhang 2013 from low
risk to unclear or high risk of bias, which may impact our interpretation of outcome 1.1. Furthermore, the effect size of gabapentin
may be an overestimation as compromised blinding may account for an exaggerated effect of 13% (Savovi
2012).
The aforementioned risk of bias due to blinding may be exacerbated by partial enrichment of the population that was enrolled. Studies
by Sang 2013, Wallace 2010 and Zhang 2013 included patients who had previously responded to gabapentin, and excluded those who
did not respond or tolerate gabapentin. This subset of participants who have already received the active drug, may be able to determine
which drug they are receiving based on their knowledge of its anticipated effects, therefore jeopardizing blinding. Thus, enrichment
can introduce performance and selection bias, which falsely inflates the proportion of patients who respond to active treatment.
This review assumed that treatment effects were not significantly affected by partial enrichment based on the results of the systematic
review by Straube 2008, which examined the effects of enrichment in 21 trials of gabapentin or pregabalin. Of the 12 studies that
examined gabapentin specifically, 10 were not enriched and 2 were partially enriched. A limitation of Straube 2008 was that the 2
partially enriched studies did not provide the proportion of patients taking gabapentin at baseline. This makes it difficult to determine
the degree and implications of enrichment. Also, Straube 2008 stated it was difficult to make meaningful comparisons between trials
using different doses of gabapentin and enrolment strategies.
123

 The issue of enriched enrolment is exemplified by the poorly described baseline characteristics in most of the studies for outcome
1.1. Although, Sang 2013 specified that 43.6% and 39.6% of those in the gabapentin and placebo groups respectively had received
gabapentin or pregabalin prior to enrolment, other studies did not disclose this information. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the
impact that enrichment has on the treatment effects of gabapentin, we believe that a subgroup analysis may be appropriate to analyze
enriched and non-enriched studies independently. The impact of enrichment may jeopardize internal and external validity, which we
feel were not adequately addressed in the “Overall Completeness and Applicability of the Evidence”.
The majorityof the includedstudiesreportedinoutcome 1.1didnotdisclose the proportionof patients receiving tricyclicantidepressants
concomitantly or specify whether the dose was altered during the study. Since there is uncertainty surrounding the maintenance of
blinding, this could lead to researchers favoring the gabapentin group by altering TCAs or other analgesics accordingly.
The review article stated that a fixed-effects model would be used if statistically significant heterogeneity was found. Despite this, even
though there was statistically significant heterogeneity for outcomes 1.2.2 and 1.3.1, a fixed effects model was still used. Moreover, the
review did not provide an assessment of possible reasons for heterogeneity. A random-effects model meta-analyses would be a more
conservative approach to address the heterogeneity to provide a more meaningful conclusion (Higgins 2011).
For outcome 1.1 Baseline Observation Carried Forward (BOCF) was utilized to address attrition in two of the six studies, which
accounted for over half of the weight. Although deemed a conservative approach, it can lead to an overestimation or underestimation
of the number of patients with greater than 50% improvement from baseline. For example, the BOCF may indirectly overestimate
the treatment effect of gabapentin by not taking into account the proportion of those receiving placebo who experienced a 50%
improvement. This is of particular concern since we believe that blinding may have been compromised in these trials as described
above. This unclear risk of bias is not captured in the summary tables which classifies BOCF as low risk. Moreover, the Summary of
Findings Table for Main Comparisons for postherpetic neuralgia states that “Imputation method used [was] (LOCF) and small study
size could influence results to reduce gabapentin efficacy”. This statement is not entirely accurate as Sang 2013 and Wallace 2010,
which account for approximately 58.1% of the weight of outcome 1.1, use BOCF. Even so, we disagree with the fact that the Last
Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) would reduce the treatment as it may in fact increase or decrease it. Despite our best efforts
to postulate whether or not LOCF and BOCF would alter treatment effects, the best approach would be delving into the individual
studies and contacting the authors for missing information.
One possible intervention to increase the confidence of the results in this review would be to conduct a sensitivity analysis. We would
have liked to see a sensitivity analysis performed regardless of the number of studies available. Sensitivity analysis would help to
characterize the impact of methodological limitations on the results of the systematic review.

Chan and colleagues begin by suggesting that the presence of adverse events with an active drug may compromise an overall blinding of
the trial by an external observer, as they would anticipate that a person with adverse events had had an active drug, while those without
had placebo. That would be even when, as in the three studies you mentioned, there was a matched placebo so that neither patients
nor observers were aware of the allocation initially.
Of course, for the individual patient, who cannot see the overall picture, that would not be the case. And since the individual patient
makes their own judgment about pain and other outcomes, the position of the outside observer is irrelevant. Moreover, when you look
at the actual event rates for adverse events in these three trials, and overall, there is a rather low increase in adverse event rates (RR 1.25
overall). Wallace and Zhang showed no difference in event rates between gabapentin and placebo, which makes it especially hard to see
how this suggested bias would act.
In this circumstance, it is hard to see what justification they can have for their statements, unless supported with empirical evidence
from elsewhere. We have been looking for some years now, as we have an interest in the methodology of systematic reviews and sources
of bias, and are aware of none.
In passing, we use both the Oxford Quality Score (to help justify inclusion and exclusion - studies must be randomised and double
blind to be accepted) and a version of Risk of Bias. The OQS now has well over 10,000 citations, and is validated. Cochrane RoB omits
several important, and possibly crucial, sources of bias. Neither is perfect, but when detecting bias we need all the tools at our disposal.
They also make a point about partial enrichment. The situation right now is that there is zero empirical evidence that partial enrichment
makes any difference to results of clinical trials in neuropathic pain. It may well be, as they say, that some residual bias is not accounted
for, but that is speculation, and not fact. The fact is that the three studies that they seem to be concerned about are not out of line with
others in the analyses, and one of them, for analysis of PGIC, was not different from placebo.
Chan and colleagues are also concerned with patients receiving TCAs. Actually, it is very unlikely that TCA prescribing changes affected
the results. Most trials indicated that any concomitant therapies would not be changed during the course of the trial. It is an interesting
speculation, but since tricyclic efficacy is as low as all others in NP (based on the rather inadequate evidence we have, as well as clinical
experience), one would really need to push this to an extreme to explain any result. Is there any evidence that increasing doses of TCAs
has any dramatic effect on analgesia? We know of none, and we also know that most people do not respond to TCAs while many suffer
adverse events, which often make them desist. It is a hard argument to maintain.
Issues around statistics refer to situations with only a handful of studies, or where one study (Zhang) gave a result favouring placebo.
Random effects models are more appropriate where there is clinical heterogeneity, which we try to avoid. Changing to random effects
does not change the result, but we might revisit this. Actually RE is more appropriate where there are a number of small studies, which is
where heterogeneity can occur - but there are number of issues intertwined here, so it isn’t simple. For example, examples of fraudulent
research often show high degrees of homogeneity, and heterogeneity tests can be used to detect fraud. We may need to reword the
methods and revisit thinking on this.
We found their point about imputation rather difficult to understand. We cannot see why that should be because the imputation is
applied equally to both active and placebo. In several individual patient level calculations that have used LOCF and BOCF there has
been little effect of imputation method on placebo, only on active treatments where there is a large adverse event withdrawal rate, as
we pointed out in our analysis in Pain. And there is good evidence of potentially very large positive bias for opioids in chronic non-
cancer pain.
We are sorry Chan and colleagues disagree with the current evidence on imputation method. We use BOCF to produce a result where
patients who are able to remain on treatment with tolerable adverse events have a high degree of pain relief. That makes clinical sense,
and is what systematic reviews tell us that patients want. It also makes sound economic sense. Using LOCF to impute results where up
to 65% of patients drop out over 12 weeks (as in opioid studies in chronic non-cancer pain) might be of some statistical interest, and
might produce significant results where BOCF does not, but it takes some explaining as to its relevance to the real world. Unless and
until that is explained to us and supported with empirical evidence, we are more than happy to stick to our guns on this.
As to contacting authors, we have done - or rather had discussions with pharmaceutical companies about the possibility of obtaining
individual patient level data for gabapentin. This will not be possible. It is a shame, because in other circumstances where we could
obtain patient level data we have been able to make some interesting and important methodological advances, even though you appear
not to agree with them.

 We find it hard to understand why Chan and colleagues would want sensitivity analysis with inadequate data. What we know is that
small studies, and small numbers of small studies, can give us the wrong answer. This has been evident for at least 20 years, and is
supported by several recent major studies, often in pain topics. To use unreliable evidence on which to base judgments like that seems
retrograde.

I am writing to pass along what appears to be a data transcription error within the recent Cochrane Review, Gabapentin for Chronic
Neuropathic Pain in Adults, CD007938, published in June 2017. While reading one of the articles included in the Cochrane Review,
referenced as Rauck 2013a (1), it appears there is a data transcription error in the Cochrane analysis in which data from the pregabalin
active control group seems to have been used in place of data from the placebo control group. It looks like the data in question are
reported from Rauck’s table 7. In the Cochrane Analysis 1.1, At least 50% pain reduction over baseline, the placebo group from Rauck
is reported as 14/66 which seems to be data from the pregabalin group in the original paper. The placebo group in Rauck table 7 should
be reported as 35/120. Similarly in Analysis 1.4, IMMPACT outcome of substantial improvement, it appears the same data was used
from Rauck as in analysis 1.1, so a similar issue exists with pregabalin results (14/66) being reported as the placebo (35/120). In the
rest of the Cochrane analyses, the placebo group from Rauck is reported with a denominator of 120, and appears accurate. Thank you
for your ongoing work on the Cochrane reviews and in how outcomes are reported. They are consistently very useful in trying to sort
out the clinical utility of these medications, and in informing frameworks of how to approach pain conditions.

Thank you for spotting this. You are of course correct. We have made the correction, and the result is that, compared with placebo and
for at least 50% pain relief, the RR falls from 1.9 (1.5 to 2.3) to 1.7 (1.4 to 2.0), while the NNT increases from 5.9 (4.6 to 8.3) to
6.6 (5.0 to 9.7); the number in the analyses increases slightly. The same change was made to the IMMPACT substantial outcome, that
uses identical data. That’s analyses 1.1 and 1.4 (Analysis 1.1; Analysis 1.4).
We have also made the changes in the Abstract, Results section (including a new version of Figure 9), SoF tables (Summary of findings
for the main comparison; Summary of findings 2; Summary of findings 3), and in the Discussion, where relevant.
As you point out, the correction makes no clinical difference.
While it is annoying that a mistake occurred, it is terrific in a living document like this that it can be corrected as soon as it is spotted
and verified.

The protocol for the original gabapentin review (Wiffen 2005) was superceded and split, and an updated protocol produced for the
2011 review (Moore 2011a), to reflect, at least in part, the more recent developments in understanding of potential biases in chronic
pain trials, and new outcomes of direct relevance to people with neuropathic pain. The main difference between the original review
and the updated protocol was more emphasis being given to a set of core outcomes, although all of those outcomes were included in
the updated protocol.
In the 2014 update we emphasised the difference between first tier and second tier evidence, and also emphasised the differences
between conditions now defined as neuropathic pain, and other conditions such as masticatory pain, complex regional pain syndrome-
1, and fibromyalgia.
In the 2017 update, we have removed tiers of evidence as these are now largely superceded by GRADE. We have set a minimum study
duration of two weeks for this chronic pain condition, in keeping with other reviews in this area that now use only longer duration
studies. We are using newer definitions for what constitutes neuropathic pain.
N O T E S
No new studies likely to change the conclusions are expected. Therefore, this review has now been stabilised following discussion with
the authors and editors. If appropriate, we will update the review if new evidence likely to change the conclusions is published, or if
standards change substantially which necessitate major revisions.
