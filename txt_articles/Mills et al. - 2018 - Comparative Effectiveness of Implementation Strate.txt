 Data Extraction—Two investigators independently extracted trial data. Trials were grouped by 
implementation strategy, and BP reduction effects were compared using multivariate-adjusted 
generalized estimating equations. A modified Cochrane Risk of Bias tool was used for trial quality 
assessment.
Data Synthesis—A total of 121 comparisons from 100 articles with 55,920 hypertensive 
patients were included. Multilevel, multicomponent strategies, such as team-based care with 
medication titration by non-physician [−7.1 mmHg (95% CI: −8.9, −5.2)], team-based care with 
medication titration by physician [−6.2 mmHg (−8.1, −4.2)], and multilevel strategies without 
team-based care [−5.0 mmHg (−8.0, −2.0)] were most effective for systolic BP reduction. Patient-
level strategies also resulted in significant systolic BP reductions of −3.9 mmHg (−5.4, −2.3) for 
health coaching and −2.7 mmHg (−3.6, −1.7) for home BP monitoring. Similar trends were 
observed for diastolic BP reduction. Provider training was tested in few trials and resulted in non-
significant BP reduction.
Limitations—Sparse data from low- and middle-income countries, few trials of some 
implementation strategies, and possible publication bias.
Conclusions—Multilevel, multicomponent strategies, followed by patient-level strategies, are 
most effective for BP control in patients with hypertension and ought to be used to improve 
hypertension control.

Introduction
Hypertension is a major public health challenge due to its high prevalence and associated 
cardiovascular disease and premature death (1,2). Pharmaceutical treatment and lifestyle 
modifications have been shown to reduce blood pressure (BP) and cardiovascular disease 
risk in randomized clinical trials (3,4). Despite these proven-effective BP interventions, only 
13.8% of adults with hypertension and 37.1% of patients with treated hypertension had their 
BP controlled worldwide in 2010 (1). Barriers to hypertension control at health care system, 
health care provider, and patient levels have been identified (5). For example, limited health 
care resources, lack of performance standards, and limited reimbursement for health 
coaching are major barriers to BP control at the health care system level; lack of adherence 
to clinical guidelines is a major barrier to BP control at the health care provider level; and 
lack of adherence to prescribed medications and lifestyle modifications are major barriers at 
the patient level (5).
Implementation strategies to overcome the barriers to BP control, such as home BP 
monitoring, health coaching, provider training, and team-based care have been tested in 
randomized trials (6,7). Most trials, however, have relatively small sample sizes and limited 
statistical power to provide a reliable estimate of intervention effects. Two previous reviews 
of implementation strategies for BP reduction included studies published up to 2003 and 
2008, respectively (6,7). They showed that compared to usual care, a number of 
implementation strategies, including team change and home BP monitoring, significantly 
improved BP control (6,7). However, the effects of various implementation strategies on BP 
control have not been directly compared in these meta-analyses. In addition, many

 implementation strategy trials have been published in the recent years. In the current meta-
analysis, we aim to assess the comparative effectiveness of various implementation strategies 
on BP reduction in patients with hypertension by direct comparison. This information could 
be used by government and non-government organizations to select the most effective 
implementation strategies for hypertension control in communities.
Methods
We developed and followed a protocol for all steps of the review and meta-analysis 
(Supplement 1).
Data Sources and Searches
MEDLINE and Embase were searched from inception to September 11, 2017 with search 
terms “hypertension” or “blood pressure” and an extensive list of terms related to provider 
education, team-based care, patient education, provider feedback and guideline adherence, 
and home BP monitoring (Appendix Table 1 and Appendix Table 2) (6–9). The search was 
restricted to clinical trials in human adults and had no language restrictions. Additional 
studies were identified by manual review of references cited in reviews, meta-analyses, and 
original articles. An extensive search of clinicaltrials.gov was also conducted to find 
additional trials and to assess publication bias by identifying completed trials without 
published results.
Study Selection
A study was eligible for inclusion if 1) it was a randomized controlled trial; 2) study 
participants were adults with hypertension defined as average systolic BP ≥ 140 mmHg, 
average diastolic BP ≥ 90 mmHg, and/or use of antihypertensive medication; 3) a main trial 
outcome was the net change in systolic BP or diastolic BP; 4) the trial intervention targets 
barriers to hypertension control at one or more of the patient, provider, and healthcare 
system levels; 5) the control group received usual care or minimal education ; 6) the trial 
duration was at least six months; 7) variance of BP changes (or data to calculate it) was 
reported; and, 8) if a trial was cluster-randomized, clustering must be accounted for in the 
analysis. No language restrictions were made. Two investigators independently screened all 
abstracts to determine initial eligibility. They further reviewed full texts for potentially 
eligible studies. Disagreements were resolved by consensus.
Data Extraction and Quality Assessment
Two investigators independently extracted data from each included trial using a standardized 
data collection form. Extracted data included study design, participant characteristics, 
intervention descriptions and study results. Data from the two investigators were compared, 
and discrepancies were resolved by consensus. For trials reporting results at more than one 
time point, the report closest to the end of the intervention was selected.
Trials were divided into eight implementation strategy categories based on intervention 
descriptions (Table 1). Categories were created based on prior literature and availability of 
trials meeting our inclusion criteria (6,7). Two categories address patient-level barriers to BP

 control only: (1) health coaching and (2) home BP monitoring; three categories target 
provider-level barriers only: (3) provider training, (4) audit and feedback, and (5) electronic 
decision support systems; and three categories are multilevel strategies: (6) multilevel 
strategies without team-based care, (7) team-based care with physicians titrating 
medications, and (8) team-based care with non-physician providers titrating medications.
Health coaching strategies could be delivered in-person or by telephone at multiple 
individual or group sessions over the intervention period. The strategies are patient-centered 
with a component of behavioral self-monitoring. A health coach (case manager, nurse, 
medical assistant or community health worker) and patients worked together using self-
discovery or active learning processes to improve medication adherence and lifestyle 
modification (10). Provider-level strategies aim to improve BP management performance of 
healthcare professionals primarily responsible for patient hypertensive care. Multilevel 
implementation strategies are aimed at overcoming barriers to hypertension control at two or 
more levels of patients, providers, health care systems, and communities. Team-based care is 
characterized by inter-professional collaboration, a patient-centered approach, and an 
integrated care process (12). In this meta-analysis, team-based care implementation 
strategies involve task-shifting or task-sharing from primary care physicians in hypertension 
patient care to nurses, pharmacists, or community health workers. Team-based care is 
divided into two categories depending on whether or not the non-physician provider can 
titrate medications. The multilevel strategies without team-based care category includes any 
intervention that targets more than one level of barriers to BP control, but does not include 
team-based care, such as patient health coaching combined with provider training. 
Multicomponent strategies are those that combine more than one approach regardless of 
barrier level.
Trials were included if their control groups were either usual care or minimal education. 
Usual care is defined as hypertension management conducted by patients’ normal care 
providers with no trial intervention. Minimal education includes the provision of educational 
materials or a brief educational session to either patients or providers.
The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool was modified to make it applicable to cluster trials in 
implementation research and used for assessing trial quality (13). In this meta-analysis, we 
have focused on the following domains for study quality assessment: random sequence 
generation, objective outcome assessment (blinding of BP observers or use of automatic BP 
cuffs), incomplete outcome data, and selective outcome reporting. Participant recruitment 
bias was also considered for cluster-randomized trials. Funding sources for all trials were 
also recorded. Risk of bias assessments were done at the trial level.
Data Synthesis and Analysis
For each trial the net change in mean BP and associated standard error was calculated from 
available data and defined as the difference (intervention minus control) in the changes of 
mean values (follow-up minus baseline). If BP was measured at multiple time points during 
follow-up, the measurements taken closest to the end of the intervention were used. In 
addition, the changes in mean BP and associated standard errors in each randomized group 
were calculated separately for comparing effects among implementation strategies.

 Random effects models using the Sidik-Jonkman residual heterogeneity estimator with the 
Knapp-Hartung small sample adjustment were used to calculate pooled mean differences 
within implementation categories using inverse variance weighting (14–16). In some trials, 
multiple intervention arms were compared to the same reference group. In these cases, 
robust variance estimation was used to account for non-independent estimates (17). 
Heterogeneity was evaluated using the Q test and quantified with the I2 index and 95% 
confidence interval calculated using the test-based method (18). Publication bias was 
assessed using Begg’s rank correlation test and Egger’s weighted linear regression test for 
implementation strategies with at least ten studies due to low statistical power with small 
sample sizes. When possible publication bias was observed, the trim-and-fill method was 
used to estimate the number of missing studies not published, augment the data to make the 
funnel plot more symmetrical, and calculate a summary estimate based on the augmented 
data (19).
Generalized estimating equations (with an exchangeable correlation matrix between 
estimates within a study) were used to compare BP reductions associated with each 
implementation strategy after important covariate adjustment and for pairwise comparisons 
between implementation strategies. Indicator variables were used for each implementation 
strategy category with the common control group as the reference. Weights for these models 
were exported from a random effects meta-analysis including all changes in mean BP and 
associated standard errors from all treatment groups. As such, these weights take into 
account within and between trial variance. Trial was treated as a cluster to maintain 
randomized comparisons, and trial-level baseline characteristics were adjusted: logit-
transformed proportion male, centered mean age, centered mean systolic BP, centered trial 
duration, and whether the control group was usual care or minimal education. A sensitivity 
analysis was conducted including only trials where all participants had uncontrolled 
hypertension at baseline.
Analyses were conducted using packages metafor, robumeta, and forestplot in R version 
3.3.2 (R Project for Statistical Computing) and PROC GENMOD in SAS version 9.4 (SAS 
Institute, Cary, NC).
Role of the Funding Source
This work was supported in part by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences under 
award number P20GM109036 and by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute under 
award number U01HL114197. The funding sources had no role in the design, conduct, or

Results
After excluding duplicates, our search strategy identified 6,697 references, of which 958 
underwent full text review (Figure 1). In total, 100 articles reporting 121 comparisons with 
55,920 participants were included (Appendix Table 3). The median of the study-specific 
mean ages was 60 years (range: 33–77), and the median of the study-specific mean baseline 
systolic and diastolic BP were 148 mmHg (range: 124–190) and 86 mmHg (range: 70–105). 
Trials ranged in length from 6 months to 5 years (median: 6 months). The number of

 comparisons per implementation category ranged from 38 for health coaching to 2 for audit 
and feedback (Table 2). Among all trials, none were identified at high risk of bias for 
random sequence generation, three for objective outcome assessment, 13 for incomplete 
outcome data, two for selective reporting, and one for recruitment bias (Appendix Tables 4 
and 5). Of the 88 studies reporting funding information, 17% reported receiving full or 
partial funding from pharmaceutical firms. The rest were funded from federal, state, and 
local governments, foundations, and universities.
Effects of implementation strategies
All five patient-level and multilevel implementation strategies were associated with 
significant reductions in systolic BP (Appendix Figure 1). Health coaching and home BP 
monitoring significantly reduced systolic BP by −4.3 mmHg (95% CI: −5.9, −2.6; p<0.001) 
and −2.2 mmHg (95% CI: −3.5, −1.0; p=0.001), respectively. The multilevel strategies 
without team-based care reduced systolic BP by −3.9 mmHg (95% CI: −6.5, −1.3; p=0.003). 
Team-based care with physicians and non-physician providers titrating medications had the 
largest pooled mean systolic BP reductions of −5.7 mmHg (95% CI: −7.9, −3.6; p<0.001) 
and −6.6 mmHg (95% CI: −9.0, −4.2; p<0.001), respectively. Strategies targeting provider-
level barriers to BP control did not significantly reduce BP compared to the control group. 
Some evidence of publication bias was observed for health coaching (Egger p=0.27; Begg 
p=0.051) and team-based care with physicians titrating medications (Egger p=0.146; Begg 
p=0.020). However, trim-and-fill analysis showed that publication bias did not account of 
the observed associations for health coaching [−4.3 mmHg (95% CI: −6.1, −2.6; p<0.001)] 
or for team-based care with physicians titrating medications [−4.2 mmHg (95% CI: −6.5, 
−1.8; p<0.001)]. In addition, a search of clinicaltrials.gov identified 191 trials potentially 
eligible for inclusion in these analyses. Of these, only three (one home BP monitoring and 
two health coaching) met our inclusion criteria, completed primary outcome collection more 
than two years ago, and had not reported results. This suggests reported results are not 
attributed to publication bias.
Similar results were observed for diastolic BP (Appendix Figure 2). Health coaching [−1.9 
mmHg (95% CI −2.8, −1.0; p<0.001)], home BP monitoring [−1.5 mmHg (−2.0, −1.0; 
p<0.001)], team-based care with titration by a physician [−2.5 mmHg (−3.9, −1.1; 
p=0.002)], and team-based care with medication titration by a non-physician provider [−3.5 
mmHg (−4.6, −2.5; p<0.001)] were all associated with a significant reduction in diastolic BP 
compared to the control group. Multilevel strategies without team-based care [−2.7 mmHg 
(−6.0, 0.6; p=0.114)] was not significantly associated with significant diastolic BP reduction. 
Provider training, audit and feedback, and electronic decision support systems were also not 
associated with a significant decline in diastolic BP.
Comparative effectiveness of implementation strategies
After adjustment for important covariates and all implementation strategies simultaneously 
using generalized estimating equations, the three multilevel strategies were the most 
effective for systolic BP reduction (Figure 2). Team-based care with medication titration by 
a non-physician [−7.1 mmHg (95% CI: −8.9, −5.2; p<0.001)] had the greatest reduction in 
systolic BP, followed by team-based care with medication titration by a physician [−6.2

 mmHg (95% CI: −8.1, −4.2; p<0.001)], and multilevel strategies without team-based care 
[−5.0 mmHg (95% CI: −8.0, −2.0; p=0.001)]. The patient-level strategies of health coaching 
[−3.9 mmHg (95% CI: −5.4, −2.3; p<0.001)] and home BP monitoring [−2.7 mmHg (95% 
CI: −3.6, −1.7; p<0.001)] were also significantly associated with reductions in systolic BP. 
After multivariate adjustment, electronic decision support systems [−3.7 mmHg (95% CI: 
−5.2, −2.2; p<0.001)] was associated with a significant systolic BP reduction, but provider 
training, and audit and feedback were not. Likewise, team-based care with medication 
titration by a non-physician [−3.1 mmHg (95% CI: −4.1, −2.2; p<0.001)] had the greatest 
reduction in diastolic BP, followed by multilevel strategies without team-based care [−2.9 
mmHg (95% CI: −5.4, −0.4; p=0.025)] and team-based care with medication titration by a 
physician [−2.7 mmHg (95% CI: −3.8, −1.5; p<0.001)]. The patient-level strategies of health 
coaching [−2.1 mmHg (95% CI: −2.9, −1.3; p<0.001)] and home BP monitoring [−1.5 
mmHg (95% CI: −2.3, −0.8; p<0.001)] were also significantly associated with reductions in 
diastolic BP. Electronic decision support systems [−1.5 mmHg (95% CI: −1.9, −1.1; 
p<0.001)] was the only provider-level strategy associated with a significant reduction in 
diastolic BP. Similar results were observed for patient-level and multilevel interventions 
when analyses included only trials where all participants had uncontrolled BP at baseline 
(Appendix Figure 3). There were insufficient studies meeting this criteria to estimate 
summary effects for audit and feedback and provider training.
Pairwise comparison of implementation strategies
Table 3 provides a pairwise comparison of the intervention strategies ordered by effect sizes 
of systolic BP reduction and adjusted for covariates. Team-based care with titration by a 
non-physician resulted in significantly greater systolic BP reductions than any of the patient-
level and provider-level strategies ranging from −3.22 to −6.29 mmHg for systolic BP and 
significantly greater diastolic BP reductions than home BP monitoring and all the provider-
level strategies ranging from −1.60 to −2.52 mmHg for diastolic BP. Team-based care with 
titration by a physician also resulted in a significantly greater reduction in systolic BP 
compared to all patient-level and provider-level strategies except health coaching.
Conclusions
Our findings indicate that implementation strategies targeting multiple-level or patient-level 
barriers are effective for BP reduction. Specifically, team-based care with and without a non-
physician team member titrating medications and multilevel strategies without team-based 
care were the most effective implementation strategies for hypertension control. In addition, 
patient health coaching and home BP monitoring were also effective.
These findings have important public health implications. Despite strong evidence that 
antihypertensive medications and lifestyle modifications reduce BP and subsequent 
cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality, hypertension control rates are low 
worldwide (5). The US Institute of Medicine and the National Heart Lung and Blood 
Institute have both called for research focusing on integrating evidence-based strategies into 
routine health care for hypertension control (20,21). Our findings provide evidence that 
multilevel, multicomponent implementation strategies are most useful and should be

 recommended in clinical practice and public health policy for hypertension control in 
communities.
Two previous meta-analyses of intervention strategies for BP reduction reviewed studies 
published up to 2003 and 2008 and showed that a number of implementation strategies, 
including team-based care and home BP monitoring, compared to the control group 
improved hypertension control (6,7). Since 2008 through September 2017 (MEDLINE 
search), meta-analyses for some individual implementation strategies have been published 
(8,22–25), but none that included all implementation strategies for BP control. Our study 
expanded on the previous meta-analyses by including many trials published since 2008. 
Moreover, our meta-analysis is the first study to directly compare the effectiveness of 
various implementation strategies on BP control after adjusting for key trial and participant 
characteristics. Generalized estimating equations using studies as clusters allowed for 
comparisons of intervention strategies while still preserving individual study randomization.
Team-based care strategies, where hypertension management responsibilities are shared 
among team members (i.e., nurses, pharmacists, medical assistants, or community health 
workers) in addition to primary care physicians, were found to be most effective for BP 
control in our analyses. Santschi and colleagues reported that compared with usual care, 
pharmacist-led interventions showed greater reductions in systolic (7.6 mmHg, 95% CI: 6.3 
to 9.0) and diastolic BP (3.9 mmHg, 95% CI: 2.8 to 5.1) in a meta-analysis of randomized 
controlled trials (22). In addition, Clark and colleagues reported that compared with usual 
care, nurse-led interventions with a nurse prescribing medications showed greater reductions 
in systolic (8.9 mmHg, 95% CI: 5.3 to 12.5) and diastolic BP (4.0 mmHg, 95% CI: 2.7 to 
5.3) in a meta-analysis of four trials (23). Team-based care is particularly effective because it 
frees physicians’ time to focus on urgent and complex cases, while allowing for patient-
centered care that is tailored, frequent, and collaborative (28). Taken together, our findings 
and those from previous research provide strong evidence that team-based care is an 
effective approach for BP control among hypertensive patients (24,27,28).
Among the included trials reporting positive findings, pharmacist-led team-based care often 
includes provider training, health coaching, and/or home BP monitoring, in addition to task-
sharing by pharmacists (29–34). Likewise, nurse-led team-based care usually includes health 
coaching and/or home BP monitoring (35,36). Community health worker-led team-based 
strategies typically include health coaching, home BP monitoring, and provider training 
(37). Multilevel implementation strategies without team-base care commonly consist of 
health coaching, home BP monitoring, and/or provider training (38,39). In some multilevel 
intervention trials, pharmacists conducted medication titration, health coaching, and/or home 
BP monitoring independent of the primary care team (40). Clearly, multilevel, 
multicomponent strategies, combining team-based care, health coaching, home BP 
monitoring, and provider training, have been proven to be the most effective strategy for BP 
control among patients with hypertension.
Our findings also showed that health coaching and home BP monitoring alone resulted in 
significant BP reduction among hypertensive patients. Health coaching is effective for 
behavioral change, including lifestyle modification and antihypertensive medication

 adherence (41). Therefore, in settings where multilevel strategies are not feasible due to 
limited resources, health coaching, especially when combined with home BP monitoring, 
might be an effective alternative for BP control. Future studies testing whether health 
coaching plus home BP monitoring provides a cost-effective approach could help to inform 
BP control strategies in populations with health disparities.
A few trials tested strategies targeting only physician-level barriers to hypertension control 
(i.e., provider training, audit and feedback, and electronic decision support systems), and 
only electronic decision support systems was significantly association with BP reduction 
after multivariate adjustment while contributing only four trials to the analysis. Although 
provider-level strategies had limited effect on their own, these intervention strategies were 
commonly a part of multilevel, multicomponent strategies shown to be effective. For 
example, Veterans Affairs medical centers and Kaiser Permanente have seen improvements 
in BP control among their patients after adopting multilevel strategies that included audit 
and feedback and electronic decision support systems (42–44). Due to the limited number of 
trials available in this category, the positive findings for electronic decision support systems 
after adjustment, and the effective use of these interventions as part of multicomponent 
interventions, future clinical trials are needed to test additional physician-targeted 
implementation strategies, such as physician-patient communication which could improve 
patient engagement and adherence to hypertension treatment (45,46).
Our analyses have several limitations. First, despite the inclusion of a large number of trials 
in this meta-analysis, some implementation strategies did not have sufficient numbers of 
studies. For example, provider training, audit and feedback, electronic decision support 
systems, and multilevel strategies without team-based care all had less than 10 comparisons. 
Second, very few multilevel intervention trials addressed system-level barriers (i.e., lack of 
performance standards, leadership commitment, and reimbursement of physician-to-patient 
health coaching). These factors could have a substantial impact on BP control among 
patients with hypertension and should be evaluated in future studies. Third, few clinical 
trials tested the effect of implementation strategies for free or low cost medications or 
financial incentives on BP control. They did not meet our inclusion criteria and were not 
included in this meta-analysis. Fourth, there were insufficient studies conducted in 
subgroups of interest, such as patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease, to estimate 
associations within these groups. Finally, only 20% of included trials were from low- and 
middle-income countries where uncontrolled hypertension is a serious public health 
problem. However, many studies included were conducted in low-income, ethnic minority, 
and other populations with health disparities in the US and other high-income countries. 
Furthermore, sixteen studies funded by the Global Alliance for Chronic Disease will help to 
partially fill this knowledge gap (37,47).
In order to translate these findings into routine clinical practice through scale-up and 
dissemination at the healthcare system level, additional research is needed on cost-
effectiveness and sustainability of implementation strategies for BP control (20, 26). While 
some trials included in this meta-analysis conducted cost-effectiveness analyses (31, 33, 34, 
37, 38, 48–52), there were not enough data for a systematic review. In addition, there were 
no long-term follow-up studies after trial completion to assess intervention sustainability.

 In conclusion, multilevel, multicomponent implementation strategies with and without team-
based care are most effective for BP control among patients with hypertension. In addition, 
health coaching and home BP monitoring targeting barriers at the patient level are also 
effective. These strategies should be disseminated and scaled up in clinical practices and 
public health programs to improve hypertension control in communities.

Implementation Strategy Category Descriptions
Implementation Strategy Category
Description
Patient-level
Health Coaching (10)
Multiple sessions for patient-centered health education and motivation delivered with 
the goal of facilitating lifestyle modification and/or medication adherence.
Home Blood Pressure Monitoring
Self-monitoring of patient blood pressure and recording of measurements either 
manually or by automatic electronic transmission; blood pressure readings provided to 
providers.
Provider-level
Provider Training
Education or training targeting providers on hypertension management, including 
guideline adherence (treatment goals, lifestyle intervention, and medication titrations), 
and/or patient communication
Audit and Feedback (11)
Repeated, periodic summaries of patient outcomes given to providers, such as blood 
pressure values, so they can evaluate and improve patient care; could also include 
provider training
Electronic Decision Support System (11)
Computerized alerts, reminders, or order sets intended to aid providers in point of care 
decision making; could also include provider training
Multilevel
Multilevel Strategy without Team-based Care
Interventions that target barriers to hypertension control at multiple levels but do not 
include team-based care, such as a combination of provider training and patient health 
coaching
Team-based Care with Physicians Titrating 
Medications (12)
Collaborative provision of care for hypertension by at least two providers, including a 
primary care physician who titrates medications, working collaboratively with patients 
to accomplish shared treatment goals.
Team-based Care with Non-Physician Providers 
Titrating Medications (12)
Collaborative provision of care for hypertension by at least two providers, including a 
non-physician team member who titrates medications, working collaboratively with 
patients to accomplish shared treatment goals.

Audit and feedback
Adjusted for sex, age, baseline systolic blood pressure (or diastolic blood pressure), trial duration, and type of control group. Strategies are ordered by rankings of net reduction in mean systolic blood pressure. Blood pressure reduction differences are in the cell in common 
between the row-defining and column-defining implementation strategy. For the mean difference in systolic blood pressure, the difference is the row strategy blood pressure reduction minus the column strategy blood pressure reduction. For the mean difference in diastolic blood 
pressure, the difference is the column strategy minus the row strategy. For example, the differences in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure reduction between team-based care with titration by a non-physician and health coaching are −3.22 (95% CI: −5.72 to −0.72) and 
−1.08 (−2.29 to 0.14), respectively.
