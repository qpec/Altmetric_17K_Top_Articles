Alzheimer’s disease is characterized by the deposition of amyloid-b as extracellular plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau as
intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. Tau pathology characterizes not only Alzheimer’s disease, but also many other tauopathies,
presenting tau as an attractive therapeutic target. Passive tau immunotherapy has been previously explored; however, because only
a small fraction of peripherally delivered antibodies crosses the blood–brain barrier, enters the brain and engages with tau that
forms intracellular aggregates, more efficient ways of antibody delivery and neuronal uptake are warranted. In the brain, tau exists
as multiple isoforms. Here, we investigated the efficacy of a novel 2N tau isoform-specific single chain antibody fragment, RN2N,
delivered by passive immunization in the P301L human tau transgenic pR5 mouse model. We demonstrate that, in treated mice,
RN2N reduces anxiety-like behaviour and phosphorylation of tau at distinct sites. When administration of RN2N was combined
with focused ultrasound in a scanning mode (scanning ultrasound), RN2N delivery into the brain and uptake by neurons were
markedly increased, and efficacy was significantly enhanced. Our study provides evidence that scanning ultrasound is a viable tool
to enhance the delivery of biologics across the blood–brain barrier and improve therapeutic outcomes and further presents single-
chain antibodies as an alternative to full-length antibodies.

Introduction
Alzheimer’s disease is characterized by the deposition of
amyloid-b as amyloid plaques and hyperphosphorylated
tau as neurofibrillary tangles, together with synaptic and
neuronal degeneration (Ising et al., 2015; Nisbet et al.,
2015). Reducing tau levels abrogates amyloid-b-mediated
toxicity (Ittner et al., 2010), making tau an attractive
therapeutic target in Alzheimer’s disease. Furthermore,
immunization with anti-tau antibodies has proven effica-
cious in multiple preclinical models (Boutajangout et al.,
2011; Yanamandra et al., 2013; Castillo-Carranza et al.,
2014; Ittner et al., 2015). It has been estimated, however,
that only �0.1% of a peripherally administered anti-

 amyloid-b antibody enters the brain (Levites et al., 2006;
Golde, 2014), challenging the therapeutic potential of
antibody-based treatments of neurodegenerative diseases.
We have previously shown that transiently opening the
blood–brain barrier by repeated focused ultrasound in a
scanning mode (scanning ultrasound, SUS) reduces the
amyloid-b burden in an Alzheimer’s disease mouse model
(Leinenga and Go
¨tz, 2015). Others have used magnetic res-
onance-guided focused ultrasound to reduce amyloid-b
pathology by delivering a low dose of an anti-amyloid-b
antibody across the blood–brain barrier (Jordao et al.,
2010). However, anti-tau therapeutics present an additional
challenge because they must also cross the neuronal cell
membrane to interact with tau.
Single chain variable fragments (scFvs) of immunoglobulins
(IgG) lack the Fc domain and are generated from fused vari-
able domains. Their low molecular weight enables increased
tissue penetration, which may facilitate transfer across the
blood–brain barrier and into brain cells. An additional advan-
tage is the lack of the Fc domain, preventing effector function-
mediated inflammatory responses in the brain and microhae-
morrhages (Wilcock et al., 2006). Therapeutic effects have
been previously demonstrated for scFvs targeting amyloid-b
(Cattepoel et al., 2011; Fernandez-Funez et al., 2015).
Here, we have generated an anti-tau scFv, RN2N, specific
for the 2N isoform of tau. We show that intravenous treat-
ment of human 2N tau-over-expressing transgenic pR5 mice
with RN2N reduces anxiety-like behaviour and tau hyperpho-
sphorylation. Furthermore, when delivery is combined with
SUS, RN2N uptake by the brain and into neurons is signifi-
cantly increased, allowing for an enhanced therapeutic effect.
Materials and methods
Antibodies
Primary antibodies used for western blot (WB), immunohisto-
chemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF) in this study were
as follows: Tau 5 (Millipore; WB 1:1000), HT7 (Thermo Fisher;
IHC: 1:500), AT180 and AT8 (Thermo Fisher; WB: 1:1000,
IHC: 1:500), pS404 (Thermo Fisher; WB: 1:1000, IHC: 1:250),
12E8 (Prothena; WB: 1:5000; IHC: 1:2000), myc (Sigma; WB:
1:2000), EEA1 (Millipore; IF: 1:500), LAMP1 (Sigma; IF:100), p-

GAPDH
(Millipore;

GSK-3b
(Cell
Signaling Technology; WB: 1:2000). The secondary antibodies
used in this study were as follows: polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse
IgG biotinylated and polyclonal goat anti-rabbit IgG biotinylated
(Dako; IHC: 1:500), goat anti-mouse IR680 and goat anti-rabbit
IR800 (Li-cor; WB:1:10000), and Alexa Fluor
� 488 donkey anti-
rabbit (Life Technologies; IF: 1:500).
Generation of the RN2N single chain
variable fragment
RN2N is an scFv derived from a 2N tau-specific mouse IgG2a
antibody raised against the tau peptide TEIPEGITAEEAGI (aa
84–97 of the longest human tau isoform, tau441) (Liu and
Go
¨tz, 2013; Liu et al., 2016a). The variable light (VL) and
heavy (VH) domains were cloned as described (Johnson and
Bird, 1991), joined by a (Gly4Ser)3 linker and placed in frame
with an N-terminal PelB sequence and C-terminal His6 and
myc tags that were synthesized (GeneArt) and cloned into
the pDEST42 expression vector (Life Technologies). For deter-
mination of the IgG EC50, the scFv gene was cloned into a
mouse
IgG2a
framework
(a
generous
gift
from
Stephen
Mahler, The University of Queensland) as previously described
(Jones et al., 2010).
Expression and purification of RN2N
Expression and purification of RN2N (29.8kDa) and a control
scFv (28.2kDa) was performed as described (Nisbet et al., 2013).
Endotoxins were removed using High Capacity Endotoxin
Removal Resin (Pierce) and levels determined using a LAL
chromogenic Endotoxin Quantification kit (Pierce).
Expression and purification of
recombinant tau
Human and mouse tau expression and purification were per-
formed as described (Liu et al., 2016a).
ELISA
The binding specificity of purified RN2N scFv was determined
using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Liu
et al., 2016a).
Mice
All animal experiments were conducted with female mice
under the guidelines of the Australian Code of Practice for
the Care and Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes and
approved by the University of Queensland Animal Ethics
Committee
(QBI/412/14/NHMRC;
QBI/027/12/NHMRC).
pR5 mice express 2N4R tau with the P301L mutation under
the control of the mThy.1.2 promoter (Go
¨tz et al., 2001).
Generation of microbubbles
Lipid-shelled microbubbles were generated in-house (Leinenga
and Go
¨tz, 2015). DSPC and DSPE-PEG2000 (Avanti Polar
Lipids) were dissolved at a 9:1 molar ratio in chloroform
(Sigma) and the solvent was evaporated under vacuum. The
dried phospholipid cake was then dissolved in phosphate-buf-
fered saline (PBS) with 10% glycerol to a concentration of 1 mg/
ml and heated to 55�C and sonicated in a sonicator water bath.
The solution was placed in 1.5ml glass HPLC vials and the air
in the vials was replaced with octafluoropropane (Arcadophta).
Microbubbles were generated on the day of the experiment by
agitating in a dental amalgamator at 4000 rpm for 40 s.

 transducer with a focal length of 80 mm, a radius of curvature
of
80 mm,
a
spherical
shell
of
80 mm
with
a
33 mm
central opening, and a motorized 3D positioning system.
The
Focus
6 dB
size
(elevation � lateral � axial)
was
1.5 mm � 1.5 mm � 12 mm at 1 MHz. The ultrasound settings
that were applied were 1 MHz centre frequency, 0.7 MPa peak
rarefactional pressure applied outside the skull, 10 Hz pulse
repetition frequency, 10 ms pulse length and a 10% duty
cycle. The entire forebrain of the mouse was sonicated by se-
quential 6 s sonications per spot.
Immunization and scanning ultra-
sound treatment
Four and a half-month-old pR5 mice were randomly assigned
to the following groups: anaesthetic only, SUS only, RN2N
only, and combined SUS and RN2N. Six to eight mice were
used per experimental group and mice were treated once a
week for 4 weeks. All animals were anaesthetized and pre-
pared as previously described (Leinenga and Go
¨tz, 2015).
RN2N (30 mg) and microbubble solution (30 ml) were mixed
in a 29 G insulin syringe (Trumo), incubated for 2 min and
then injected retro-orbitally. Animals that did not receive SUS
were placed under the ultrasound transducer without ultra-
sound application. Animals that did receive SUS were placed
in a head frame (Narishige) and SUS was applied to the entire
brain as previously described (Leinenga and Go
¨tz, 2015).
Upon completion of the study, anaesthetized mice were trans-
cardially perfused with PBS, their brains harvested and the
hemispheres separated. One hemisphere was snap-frozen, and
the other immersion-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma).
Elevated plus maze
Anxiety-like behaviour was assessed by the elevated plus maze
as previously described (Koss et al., 2016) with some changes.
Briefly, mice were placed in the central area of the maze (ele-
vated cross-shaped apparatus with a central square, and closed
as well as open arms with unprotected edges). The time spent
in the three zones over a 5-min period was recorded using an
overhead
camera
with
EthovisionXT
TM
tracking
software
(Ethovision). The percentage time spent in each arm was cal-
culated. Seven untreated wild-type littermates were used as
controls. Analysis was conducted blinded.
Histology
Paraffin-embedded brain sections between Bregma �1.34 mm
and �2.06 mm were analysed by immunohistochemistry as
described (Ittner et al., 2008), using at least four sections per
mouse. The mean percentage area showing tau-positive immu-
noreactivity was calculated by drawing a rectangular region of
interest around the amygdala and the ICH profiler plug-in for
ImageJ (Varghese et al., 2014). Due to the high level of back-
ground staining observed in some 12E8 sections, the use of
IHC profiler plugin was not appropriate. For these sections,
we defined tau-positive immunoreactivity as areas having a
DAB intensity more than one standard deviation higher than
the mean DAB intensity of the entire section. On sections
where background staining was low, 12E8 sections were
analysed by both this method and the IHC profiler which
gave comparable results. Analysis was conducted blinded.
In vitro phosphorylation assay
The ability of GSK-3b to phosphorylate tau in the presence of
RN2N scFv was analysed by incubating 10 mM tau alone or
with either RN2N or control N1 scFv at a concentration of
0.1, 1 and 10 mM, respectively, for 1 h at room temperature.
Samples were then incubated with or without 9 units GSK-3b
and 80 mM ATP in kinase buffer (New England Biosciences) at
30�C for 8 h. Phosphorylation was determined by electrophor-
esis on 10% polyacrylamide gels followed by Coomassie stain-
ing or western blotting with the phosphorylated tau-specific
antibodies AT8, AT180, 12E8, pSer404, as well as Tau5 for
total tau and myc for myc-tagged scFv detection using the
LiCor Odyssey system.
RN2N brain delivery assessment
RN2N was conjugated with Alexa Fluor
� 647 (Thermo Fisher)
and
purified
by
size
exclusion
chromatography
using
a
Superdex 200 10/300 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated
in PBS pH 7.4 at 0.5 ml/min.
pR5 mice aged 6 or 8 months were randomly assigned to the
following groups: SUS only, RN2N only and combined SUS
and RN2N. Three mice were used per group and treatment
was conducted as described above. Different from above, to
assess antibody delivery pR5 mice were injected with a higher
dose of 90 mg RN2N. At 30 min after delivery, mice were given
an overdose of sodium pentabarbitone and transcardially per-
fused with PBS. The brains were dissected as described above.
For analysis of brain uptake of Alexa Fluor
� 647-conjugated
RN2N, the fixed hemispheres of the mice were imaged in a Li-
COR Odyssey Fc near-infrared scanner (700 nm laser 2 min
scan time) before being cryo-protected by immersion in 30%
sucrose and then sectioned at 40-mm thickness on a freezing
sliding microtome. For immunofluorescence, sections were
incubated with primary antibodies against tau (HT7), EEA1
and LAMP1 overnight, followed by 2 h incubation in Alexa
Fluor
� 488-conjugated secondary antibodies. Sections were
mounted on slides and stained with 1 mg/ml DAPI in PBS for
10 min, and cover-slipped with fluorescent mounting medium
(Dako). Images were taken with a Zeiss LSM510 scanning
confocal microscope.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed with GraphPad Prism 6.0c
software using one-way ANOVA or t-test. All values are given
as mean � standard error of the mean (SEM).

 and the presence of three or four microtubule-binding
repeat domains. We have previously performed co-immu-
noprecipitations followed by mass spectrometry, which sug-
gested that 2N tau interacts preferentially with proteins
implicated
in
neurodegenerative
diseases
(Liu
et
al.,
2016a).
We

raised
a

antibody,

IgG,

2N
tau
(Supplementary Fig. 1A). The specificity of RN2N IgG
was confirmed by western blotting (Supplementary Fig.
1B) and compared to the monoclonal antibody, Tau-5,
that recognizes all tau isoforms (Supplementary Fig. 1B).
To minimize the size and remove the potentially immuno-
genic Fc region, we generated an RN2N scFv by genetically
fusing the VH and VL chains. The resulting myc-tagged
antibody
fragment
existed
as
a
stable
monomer
(Supplementary Fig. 1C) and had an approximate size of
28 kDa (Supplementary Fig. 1D).
To ensure uncompromised binding and specificity of
RN2N scFv to 2N tau, ELISA was performed. While the
binding of RN2N scFv to tau was reduced compared to the
parental IgG (EC50 of 86 nM for the scFv compared to
12 nM for the IgG) (Supplementary Fig. 1E), its specificity
for 2N tau was, however, retained (Supplementary Fig. 1F).
RN2N single chain variable fragment
combined with scanning ultrasound
reduces anxiety in pR5 tau transgenic
mice
We next sought to determine whether passive immuniza-
tion with RN2N ameliorates the tau-related phenotype
in vivo and to investigate the effect of combining delivery
with SUS (Fig. 1A). The pR5 strain presents with a pro-
gressive tau pathology in several brain areas that is initiated
with pronounced accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau
in the amygdala from around 4 months of age onwards
(Go
¨tz et al., 2001; Pennanen et al., 2004). The amygdala
is involved in creating, maintaining and modifying anxiety
and fear responses. Furthermore, increased anxiety is com-
monly observed in patients with Alzheimer’s disease or
frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) (Porter et al.,
2003), and increased anxiety-like behaviour has been
found in FTLD-Tau mouse models, as assessed by the ele-
vated plus maze (Walf and Frye, 2007; Koss et al., 2016).
Age-matched pR5 mice were split into four treatment
groups (Fig. 1B). The first underwent anaesthesia only,
the second received microbubbles followed by SUS, the
third received RN2N, and the fourth received both micro-
bubbles and RN2N followed by SUS (Fig. 1B). SUS was
conducted under settings that have previously been shown
to cause no damage (Leinenga and Go
¨tz, 2015). A group of
wild-type mice did not undergo any treatment. pR5 mice
were treated once per week for 4 consecutive weeks, after
which anxiety-like behaviour was tested in the elevated plus
maze (Fig. 1C). To ensure the anaesthetic was not having
an effect on anxiety, wild-type mice were treated for 4
weeks with anaesthetic and compared to untreated mice.
No significant difference in the percentage time spent in
the
open
arm
was
observed
between
these
groups
(16.44 � 3.74 of total time for the treated group compared
to 13 � 3.70 for the untreated group, n = 6, mean � SEM).
pR5 mice demonstrated increased anxiety-like behaviour
characterized by a decreased percentage time spent in the
open arms (2% of total time for pR5 mice compared to
18% for wild-type controls) (Fig. 1D and E). Treatment
with RN2N alone resulted in a slight but significant in-
crease in the percentage time spent in the open arms
(6%) that was not observed in the SUS only group (2%)
(Fig. 1D and E). Combining RN2N and SUS, however,
further increased the percentage time spent in the open
arms (10%) (Fig. 1D and E), suggesting that RN2N is cap-
able of reducing anxiety-like behaviour in pR5 mice, an
effect that is greatly improved when RN2N is delivered
with SUS.
RN2N delivery in combination with
scanning ultrasound reduces phos-
phorylated tau levels in pR5 mice
We
next
determined
if
the
behavioural
improvement
observed with RN2N alone or in combination with SUS
was
associated
with
a
reduction
in
tau
hyperphosphorylation.
While western blotting and ELISA of total brain hom-
ogenate were not sensitive enough to accurately detect p-
tau levels in the treated mice, staining of brain sections for
tau phosphorylated at the AT8 epitope pSer202/pThr205
(Biernat et al., 1992) and the AT180 epitope pThr231
(Goedert et al., 1994; Amniai et al., 2011), both major
phosphorylation sites in tauopathy and pR5 mice revealed
phosphorylated tau predominantly in the amygdala (Fig.
2A–D) (Deters et al., 2008). The total AT8-immunoreactive
area in the amygdala of the pR5 group was 51% (Fig. 2C).
Treatment with RN2N or SUS alone significantly reduced
the AT8-immunoreactive area to 33% and 34%, respect-
ively, compared to the pR5 control (Fig. 2D). Treatment
with the combination of RN2N and SUS further reduced
the AT8-immunoreactive area to 15% (Fig. 2C). These re-
sults were mirrored by those observed with AT180, with
the total AT180-immunoreactive area in the amygdala of
the pR5 group being 57% (Fig. 2D). Treatment with
RN2N or SUS alone significantly reduced the AT180-
immunoreactive area to 37% and 36%, respectively, com-
pared to the pR5 control (Fig. 2D). Combined treatment
with RN2N and SUS further reduced the immunoreactive
area to 17% (Fig. 2D). In contrast, the total 12E8-immu-
noreactive area in the amygdala of the pR5 group was
36% and treatment with RN2N or SUS alone did not
reduce this (Fig. 2E). The combined treatment however,
reduced the 12E8-immunoreactive area to 20% compared
to the pR5 only (Fig. 2E). Furthermore, the total pSer404-
immunoreactive area in the amygdala of the pR5 mice was

 35% and this was not reduced in any of the treatment
groups (Fig. 2F). Preliminary work demonstrated a signifi-
cant reduction (17%, P = 0.008, t-test) of total GSK3,
but not p-GSK3, in the brains of the SUS-only treated
group compared to the anaesthetic only controls, which
may explain the decreased p-tau levels in this treatment
group.

 been reported to be responsible for tau hyperphosphoryla-
tion and converting amorphous into fibrillar tau in pR5
mice (Ko
¨hler et al., 2013). To determine whether RN2N
binding to tau inhibits GSK3b, recombinant human tau
was incubated in the presence of RN2N and GSK3b.
Although tau did undergo phosphorylation in the presence
of RN2N scFv, as indicated by the mobility shift of tau,
AT8 and AT180 phosphorylation were inhibited (Fig. 3A
and B). This was not observed when tau was incubated in
the presence of the control scFv, suggesting that inhibition
of AT8 and AT180 phosphorylation occurs because of a
direct interaction between tau and RN2N scFv (Fig. 3A). In
Figure 2 Delivery of RN2N in combination with SUS significantly reduces phosphorylated tau levels in the amygdala.

treatment group (Scale bar = 100 mm). (B) Representative images of the AT180 phosphorylated tau immunoreactivity observed in the amygdala of
pR5 mice in each treatment group (Scale bar = 100 mm). (C) AT8 phosphorylated tau in the amygdala was significantly reduced in all treatment
groups compared to the pR5 group (****P 4 0.0001). Comparison of the pR5 + RN2N + SUS group to the pR5 + SUS and pR5 + RN2N groups
demonstrates a further reduction in AT8 tau-positive area in the amygdala (####P 4 0.0001). (D) AT180 phosphorylated tau in the amygdala was
significantly reduced in all treatment groups compared to the pR5 group (****P 4 0.0001). Comparison of the pR5 + RN2N + SUS group to the
pR5 + SUS and pR5 + RN2N groups demonstrates a further reduction in AT180 tau-positive area in the amygdala (###P = 0.0002). (E) 12E8
phosphorylated tau in the amygdala was significantly reduced in the RN2N + SUS group compared to the pR5 group (**P 5 0.01), and was
reduced in comparison to pR5 + SUS and pR5 + RN2N groups (#P 4 0.05). (F) Ser404 phosphorylated tau in the amygdala was not significantly
reduced in any treatment group compared to the pR5 group (mean � SEM, one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison test, n = 5).

 contrast, phosphorylation at the C-terminal epitopes, 12E8
and Ser404, was not inhibited in the presence of RN2N
(Fig. 3A), suggesting that RN2N inhibition of GSK3b phos-
phorylation is limited to the N-terminus of tau.
Ultrasound-enhanced RN2N delivery
across the blood–brain barrier leads
to neuronal uptake
To investigate whether the enhanced therapeutic effect of
RN2N when delivered by SUS was due to increased levels
of brain RN2N, we delivered Alexa Fluor
� 647-conjugated
RN2N with microbubbles into the peripheral circulation
and performed SUS or sham treatment. Using Li-COR in-
frared imaging, Alexa Fluor
� 647-labelled RN2N was de-
tectable in the brain of both 6- and 8-month-old pR5 mice
30 min after SUS treatment, but not when RN2N was in-
jected without SUS, or when SUS was applied without
RN2N (Fig. 4A). When quantified, the mean scFv fluores-
cent intensity in the brain increased from 57.7 to 662 ar-
bitrary units when SUS was applied (11-fold increase) (Fig.
4A). Furthermore, confocal imaging of brain sections
showed widespread hippocampal and cortical delivery of
RN2N when SUS was applied (Fig. 4B). The cytoarchitec-
ture of the hippocampus allowed demonstrating not only
an uptake and distribution into the cell body, but also into
proximal and distal dendrites, a compartment where tau
toxicity is believed to be exerted (Fig. 4B, inset). To deter-
mine if RN2N is contained within endosomes or lysosomes,
we performed immunofluorescence for EEA1 (Fig. 4C) and
LAMP1 (Fig. 4D). These stainings indicate that RN2N is
not confined to the endosomal pathway after uptake and is
distributed
throughout
neurons.
Importantly,
neuronal
uptake of RN2N was also observed in the amygdala after
SUS treatment where it co-localized with tau (Fig. 4E). We
therefore conclude that the enhanced effect of RN2N when
delivered by SUS occurs conjointly with increased brain
levels and efficient neuronal uptake of the scFv.
Discussion
Here we show that a tau-isoform specific scFv, RN2N, can
reduce anxiety-like behaviour and tau phosphorylation in
pR5 mice, and that this effect is significantly enhanced
when delivery is combined with SUS. RN2N specifically
recognizes the 2N tau isoform, which has not previously
been targeted therapeutically. In the adult human brain, 2N
tau is under-represented compared to the 0N and 1N iso-
forms and is estimated to comprise �9% of total tau
(Goedert and Jakes, 1990). Considering that 2N tau has
been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases (Liu et al.,
2016a), targeting only this subset of tau may be sufficient
to delay or halt the disease.
We have demonstrated in vitro that RN2N inhibits the
GSK3b phosphorylation of tau at N-terminal sites (Ser202
and Thr231) but not at a C-terminal site (Ser404). GSK3b
is a proline-directed kinase that plays a major role in reg-
ulating tau under both physiological and pathological con-
ditions (Cho and Johnson, 2003; Hanger and Noble,
2011). GSK3b can phosphorylate its substrate on either
unprimed
Ser/Thr-Pro
motifs
or
a
primed
motif
{(S/
T)XXX(S/T)[P]}, which is first phosphorylated at a serine
or threonine, four residues C-terminal to its target (Cho
and Johnson, 2003). We therefore hypothesize that binding
of RN2N to tau prevents the interaction between GSK3b
and tau required for phosphorylation of more N-terminal
epitopes. This may be caused by direct blocking of GSK3b
or alternatively, as some GSK3b phosphorylated epitopes
require a prior phosphorylation by a priming kinase, it is
possible that RN2N blocks the priming required for GSK3b
phosphorylation at the more N-terminal epitopes. Our
in vitro data could explain the reduction in tau phosphor-
ylation that we observed at the AT8, AT180 and to a lesser
extent 12E8 epitopes after treatment with RN2N and SUS
in the pR5 mice, although further work is required to de-
termine the exact mechanism. Nonetheless, it is reasonable
to assume that the reduction in phosphorylated tau in the
amygdala after the combined RN2N and SUS treatment led
to a reduction in anxiety-like behaviour characteristic of
the pR5 mice. Future studies will determine whether this
treatment strategy can also clear phosphorylated tau and
prevent memory impairment in older pR5 mice.
We had aimed to determine changes in tau levels and tau
phosphorylation by both ELISA and western blotting; how-
ever, because the mice were analysed at an age of disease
onset with low total levels of p-tau, levels of different forms
of p-tau were at or below the limit of detection. Therefore,
we used immunohistochemistry, which allowed us to moni-
tor changes in p-tau in the amygdala, where disease in the
pR5 mice is initiated. Interestingly, we also observed
reduced tau phosphorylation in the SUS-only group, sug-
gesting that SUS may specifically influence tau phosphoryl-
ation. However, as no decrease in anxiety-like behaviour
was observed in this group, the mechanism by which SUS
decreases tau phosphorylation most likely differs from that
of RN2N. Ultrasound has previously been demonstrated to
increase the ubiquitination of proteins specifically within
neurons (Alonso et al., 2010). It is therefore possible that
SUS increases the turnover of phosphorylated tau in the
pR5 mice through the ubiquitin pathway. One possible
mechanism by which SUS is reducing tau phosphorylation
is by an effect on kinases such as GSK3. Preliminary work
from our group demonstrated a significant reduction of
total GSK3, but not p-GSK3, in the brains of the SUS-
only treated group compared to the anaesthetic only con-
trols, which may also explain the decrease in p-tau levels in
this treatment group. We have not analysed other kinases
at this stage, and plan to explore this further. Investigating
the role of SUS alone in tau transgenic mice as well as the
underlying mechanisms will determine if this approach can
be used as a therapy for Alzheimer’s disease and related
tauopathies.

 In addition to demonstrating that a 2N tau isoform-spe-
cific scFv reduces anxiety-like behaviour and tau phosphor-
ylation in vivo, we have also demonstrated that SUS
enhances RN2N delivery across the blood–brain barrier
and into neurons. Focused ultrasound has previously been
demonstrated to increase the CNS uptake of a full-sized
IgG by 5.7 to 56.7-fold (Liu et al., 2016b). Although we
did not compare the delivery of the RN2N IgG to that of
Figure 4 SUS enhances RN2N scFv delivery across the blood–brain barrier and into neurons. pR5 mice under anaesthesia were
injected retro-orbitally with either microbubbles only (SUS), RN2N conjugated to Alexa 647 only (RN2N) or a combination of both
(RN2N + SUS). SUS was then applied to SUS and RN2N + SUS groups. After 30 min mice were sacrificed and tissue analysed by fluorescence
imaging. (A) Fluorescence imaging indicates widespread brain uptake of RN2N in 6-month and 8-month-old RN2N + SUS treated mice.
Quantification of the fluorescent intensity demonstrates an approximate 11-fold increase in scFv uptake in the RN2N + SUS treated mice
(mean = 662 � 119) compared to the RN2N only treated mice (mean = 58 � 32) (grouping 6-month-old mice = red squares; and 8-month-old
mice = black circles; mean � SEM, P 5 0.0001, one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post-test). (B) Post-sectioning, RN2N was only detectable in the
RN2N + SUS treated mice as shown for the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Inset: Zoomed-in image of RN2N + SUS treated mouse brain tissue
with RN2N observed within neuronal cell bodies and apical dendrites (arrow). (C) Co-immunofluorescence staining for EEA1 (green) and RN2N
(magenta) and (D) LAMP1 (green) and RN2N (magenta) indicates that the internalized RN2N is not confined to endosomes or lysosomes (Scale
bar = 10 mm). (E) In the RN2N + SUS treated mice, RN2N is also observed in the amygdala where it co-localized with HT7 staining (human tau).

 the scFv, it is possible that the smaller size of the scFv
compared to a full-sized antibody may optimize SUS-
mediated delivery of RN2N into the brain. Ultrasound de-
livery studies using dextrans of varying sizes suggest that
this might be the case, with smaller dextrans being de-
livered into the brain at higher levels and more homoge-
nously with ultrasound than larger dextrans. This also
correlates with ultrasound pressure, suggesting, from a
safety point of view, that there is a size limit associated
with the technique (Choi et al., 2010). Furthermore,
in vitro ultrasound-enhanced cellular uptake of different
dextrans demonstrated that, although the percentage of
cells that internalized dextran was independent of the mo-
lecular weight, the number of internalized molecules was
higher for smaller dextrans (Afadzi et al., 2013). Increased
neuronal uptake of an anti-tau scFv compared to the IgG
has previously been shown in a tau transgenic mouse model
after intracarotid injection (Krishnaswamy et al., 2014).
Increased neuronal delivery has also been demonstrated
with an anti-tau fragment antigen-binding (Fab) fragment
compared to the IgG in vitro (Gu et al., 2013). These stu-
dies suggest that the scFv format of RN2N may also en-
hance its SUS-mediated neuronal uptake. The mechanism
by which RN2N enters the neuron, however, is yet to be
investigated. Previous studies with anti-tau antibodies have
demonstrated that antibody uptake levels correlate with
neuronal tau levels, suggesting that the presence of tau is
required for the antibody uptake (Congdon et al., 2013;
Collin et al., 2014). This process primarily occurs via cla-
thrin-dependent
Fc�II/III
endocytosis
(Congdon
et
al.,
2013). Interestingly, bulk endocytosis is the major mechan-
ism by which ultrasound-enhanced cellular internalization
of dextran occurs (Afadzi et al., 2013) and is the proposed
mechanism by which an anti-tau Fab fragment is thought
to be internalized (Gu et al., 2013), presenting a similar
mechanism for SUS-enhanced neuronal uptake of RN2N,
despite the lack of the Fc region. Following neuronal
uptake we observed RN2N was not confined to endosomes
and therefore avoids immediate lysosomal degradation. It is
therefore likely that RN2N binds to tau in the cytoplasm.
Whilst the mechanism by which RN2N escapes endosomes
in unknown, it is possible that this process is mediated by
the C-terminal histidine tag. In drug delivery, histidine rich
peptides are widely used as powerful endosomal escape
agents. Within endosomes, the imidazole group of histidine
gets protonated under the acidic conditions. This step re-
cruits chloride ions, which results in osmotic swelling and
endosomal cracking leading to the cytoplasmic release of
the histidine-tagged molecule (Vazquez et al., 2008; Ferrer-
Miralles et al., 2011).
In summary, we have demonstrated that passive immun-
ization against 2N tau with RN2N scFv effectively de-
creases tau phosphorylation and anxiety-like behaviour in
pR5 mice. Furthermore, SUS-enhanced delivery of RN2N
significantly increases its efficacy by increasing the amount
of antibody delivered to the brain, as well as into neurons,
where tau is predominately localized. While RN2N only
targets a subset of tau and its ability to reduce tau path-
ology in a model expressing all isoforms of tau needs to be
investigated, our proof-of-principle study demonstrates SUS
may be applied to any therapeutic antibody to increase
their efficacy. The therapeutic delivery combined with
SUS could offer significant clinical benefits for the treat-
ment of patients with Alzheimer’s disease and related tauo-
pathies by reducing both treatment cost and duration.
