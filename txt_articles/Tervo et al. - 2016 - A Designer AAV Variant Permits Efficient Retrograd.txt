Summary
Efficient retrograde access to projection neurons for the delivery of sensors and effectors 
constitutes an important and enabling capability for neural circuit dissection. Such an approach 
would also be useful for gene therapy, including the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders 
characterized by pathological spread through functionally connected and highly distributed 
networks. Viral vectors, in particular, are powerful gene delivery vehicles for the nervous system, 
but all available tools suffer from inefficient retrograde transport or limited clinical potential. To 
address this need, we applied in vivo directed evolution to engineer potent retrograde functionality 
into the capsid of adeno-associated virus (AAV) — a vector that has shown promise in 
neuroscience research and the clinic. A newly evolved variant, rAAV2-retro, permits robust 
retrograde access to projection neurons with efficiency comparable to classical synthetic 
retrograde tracers, and enables sufficient sensor/effector expression for functional circuit 
interrogation and in vivo genome editing in targeted neuronal populations.

 Introduction
Brain functions such as perception, cognition, and the control of movement depend on the 
coordinated action of large-scale neuronal networks, local circuit modules linked together by 
long-range connections (Miller and Vogt, 1984; Tomioka et al., 2005; Ramón y Cajol, 1911). 
Such long-range connections are formed by projection neurons that often comprise several 
intermingled classes, each projecting to a distinct constellation of downstream targets. 
Projection neurons have also been implicated in the spread of several neurodegenerative 
diseases from spatially localized sites of onset (Guo and Lee, 2014; Seeley et al., 2009). 
Thus, the ability to selectively target specific classes of projection neurons for transgene 
delivery (e.g. for activity monitoring or manipulation, or genome editing for targeted gene 
knock-outs or repair of pathological mutations) will be important both for gaining insights 
into how large-scale networks contribute to brain function and, in the long-run, for 
therapeutic intervention in neurodegenerative diseases.
Viral vectors constitute an important class of tools for introducing transgenes into specific 
neuronal populations and are by far the best option for genetic access to target projection 
neurons through entry at axonal terminals and retrograde transport of their payload to the 
cell nuclei. A number of naturally evolved neurotropic viruses exhibit retrograde spread as 
part of their lifecycle, including rabies (Baer et al., 1965; Callaway and Luo, 2015; 
Wickersham et al., 2007), poliovirus (Ohka et al., 1998) and herpes simplex virus (HSV) 
(Ugolini et al., 1987) among others. Of these, rabies virus is particularly neuro-invasive 
(Coulon et al., 1989) and quickly propagates through the nervous system through trans-
cellular transfer (Kelly and Strick, 2000). However, its potential for both biological 
investigation and gene therapy is hampered by excessive virulence (Schnell et al., 2010), 
though progress is being made to reduce its toxicity (Reardon et al., 2016). In addition to 
naturally neurotropic strains, many other viruses can infect neurons when administered 
directly to the nervous system, with “pseudorabies” (SuHV1, actually a herpesvirus), 
adenoviruses and lentiviruses used most commonly in animal research. Canine adenovirus-2 
(CAV-2) displays the best infectivity and retrograde transport of this class of viruses 
(Soudais et al., 2001) and has increasingly become the reagent of choice for accessing 
projection neurons (Junyent and Kremer, 2015). However, CAV-2 permits only modest levels 
of transgene expression, displays some toxicity (Piersanti et al., 2013; Simão et al., 2015) 
and is currently not easily compatible with scalable, robust production for the generation of 
clinical-grade or even large animal studies (Kremer et al., 2000). Thus, the development of a 
non-toxic, readily manufactured viral vector that affords flexible packaging of different 
transgenes, is robustly internalized and retrogradely transported by axons, and supports 
long-term, high-level payload expression remains a pressing need.
Recombinant adeno-associated viruses (rAAVs) have emerged as an effective platform for in 
vivo gene therapy, as they mediate high-level transgene expression, are non-toxic, and evoke 
minimal immune responses (Kaplitt et al., 2007). These properties were at the core of the 
decision to grant the first full regulatory approval of any gene therapy treatment to rAAV-
mediated restoration of lipoprotein lipase deficiency (Gaudet et al., 2010). rAAVs hold great 
promise in clinical trials for a range of neurological disorders (Ojala et al., 2014), and they 
constitute some of the most widespread vectors in neuroscience research (Murlidharan et al., 
Tervo et al.

 2014). Since the original discovery that AAV can undergo retrograde transport (Kaspar et al., 
2002), rAAVs have afforded some degree of retrograde access to projection neurons in select 
circuits (Castle et al., 2014; Hollis Ii et al., 2008; Kaspar et al., 2002; Kaspar et al., 2003; 
Rothermel et al., 2013; Taymans et al., 2007; Towne et al., 2010), but their natural 
propensity for retrograde transport is low, hampering efforts to address the role of projection 
neurons in circuit computations or disease progression. Here we describe the in vivo directed 
evolution (Kotterman and Schaffer, 2014) of a new rAAV variant (rAAV2-retro) that – in 
addition to its regular ability to infect neuronal cell bodies at the site of exposure – is 
robustly internalized by axons and mediates retrograde access to projection neurons with 
efficiency comparable to classical retrograde labeling reagents such as synthetic dyes. The 
rAAV2-retro gene delivery system can be used on its own or in conjunction with Cre 
recombinase driver lines to achieve long-term, high-level transgene expression that is 
sufficient for effective functional interrogation of neural circuit function, as well as for 
genome editing in targeted neuronal populations.
Results
Directed evolution of rAAV2-retro
To engineer novel rAAVs with enhanced retrograde transport, we designed an in vivo 
directed-evolution approach to enrich for rAAV capsid variants that were efficiently 
transported to cell bodies of neurons sending long-range projections to the site of virus 
injection in the mouse brain (Figure 1A and Experimental Procedures). To maximize the 
likelihood of recovering a variant with the desired properties, we started with a diverse 
mixture of previously described libraries of rAAV cap variants (Koerber et al., 2008; 
Koerber et al., 2009; Koerber et al., 2006; Müller et al., 2003). Viral particles were packaged 
in a way that linked each capsid variant to the AAV genome containing the corresponding 
cap gene, and the final pool of capsid variants included point mutants, variants with a 
random 7-mer (plus 3 constant flanking residues) peptide insertion into the region AAV2 
utilizes to bind its co-receptor heparin (Kern et al., 2003), and random chimeras of capsid 
gene sequences from seven parental serotypes (Figure 1A and Experimental Procedures). To 
identify variants with broad retrograde tropism, we targeted two independent populations of 
projection neurons: striatal GABAergic neurons projecting to substantia nigra pars reticulata 
(SNr) and glutamatergic hindbrain neurons projecting to the cerebellar cortex. Three weeks 
following injection of the entire pool of rAAV variants into the SNr or cerebellum (one 
injection per animal), striatal or hindbrain tissue, respectively, was removed, the cap 
sequences were recovered by PCR, and virus was repackaged (Figure 1B). After two more 
selection steps, error-prone PCR was performed to further diversify the library, followed by 
two final in vivo selection steps.
We sequenced 30 cap variants after the fourth round of evolution, and the majority 
originated from the insertion library and contained exogenous 10-mer peptides between 
N587 and R588 of the wild-type AAV2 VP1 capsid gene (Müller et al., 2003) (see 
Experimental Procedures). Intriguingly, all of the recovered inserts were of the form 
LAxxDxTKxA or LAxDxTKxxA; mutations elsewhere in the sequence were also enriched 
(Table S1). We sequenced a further 22 clones after the fifth round of evolution, and with this

 additional round of evolution, all sequences were AAV2 mutants with LAxxDxTKxA/
LAxDxTKxxA insertions (Table S1), demonstrating a marked degree of further 
convergence. Such convergence suggested that specific peptide insertions into the heparin-
binding loop were largely responsible for the retrograde functionality, with potential 
secondary contributions from the other sites (see Discussion).
We next focused a secondary screen (not shown) on seventeen isolated variants possessing 
different combinations of peptide insertions and point mutations in the capsid sequence. To 
apply a high level of stringency, the chosen variants were packaged with enhanced green 
fluorescent protein (EGFP) transgene driven by the CMV promoter, which is typically weak 
in neurons. For each capsid variant, we evaluated its ability to deliver sufficient payload to 
cell bodies in key afferent regions to permit the detection of non-antibody-amplified EGFP 
signal three weeks after injection. The clone (insert LADQDYTKTA+ V708I + N382D) that 
displayed the strongest retrograde transport in two independent circuits in this secondary 
screen (cortex to globus pallidus and inferior olive/basal pontine nuclei (BPN) to 
cerebellum) was chosen for further analysis and named rAAV2-retro. When we assessed two 
additional promoters more commonly used in rodent in vivo studies (CAG – Figure 1B, or 
human Synapsin-1, data not shown), we observed remarkable retrograde labeling efficiency 
with this rAAV variant in a range of different circuits in mice and rats (Figure 1B, Figure S1, 
Movie S1 and see below). Swapping the 7-mer insertion to one of the other recovered 
sequences or adding additional point mutations identified in the screen did not lead to further 
increases in retrograde transport (data not shown).
Efficient retrograde access to projection neurons
The corticopontine tract is a remarkably convergent descending motor pathway, contributing 
more than95% of the afferents to the basal pontine nuclei (BPN) (Brodal and Bjaalie, 1992). 
This pathway is therefore particularly advantageous for quantifying the efficiency of viral 
uptake and retrograde transport by axonal terminals of projection neurons. Indeed, injection 
of rAAV2-retro into the BPN resulted in dense labeling of layer V neurons (Figure 2A), 
consistent with past tracing studies (Legg et al., 1989).
We therefore next compared the efficacy of retrograde transport in the corticopontine circuit 
for rAAV2-retrovs. several commonly used AAV serotypes, under identical infection and 
processing conditions (Figure 2B–D, Experimental Procedures). To ensure quantification 
accuracy and to eliminate the possible confound of cell-to-cell variability in transgene 
expression level, we used the AAV to deliver Cre recombinase to Rosa26-Lox-STOP-Lox-
H2B-EGFP (histone-fused EGFP) transgenic mice (He et al., 2012). Even a low 
concentration of the Cre enzyme is sufficient to turn on the expression of such a Cre-
dependent cassette (Nagy, 2000), and the stringent nuclear localization of the histone-fused 
reporter affords unambiguous identification of infected cells, without confounding neuropil 
signal.
We used a semi-automated analysis procedure to calculate the linear density of infected 
cortical projection neurons in imaged sagittal sections from mouse brains harvested three 
weeks after local virus injection in the BPN (Figure 2C, Experimental Procedures). For 
animals infected with rAAV2, we observed minimal cortical GFP expression (linear density

 0.98 ± 0.20 neurons/mm, mean ± S.E.M., n=5; Figures 2B, middle panel). In contrast, and in 
agreement with the earlier observation (Figure 2A), a dense layer of GFP-positive layer V 
projection neurons could be observed throughout the rostro-caudal axis of the cortex in 
rAAV2-retro-injected animals (linear density 130.11±11.08 neurons/mm, n=4; Figure 2B, 
lower panel). None of the other commonly used AAV serotypes, nor the canine 
adenovirus-2,matched the retrograde efficiency of the engineered rAAV2-retro variant 
(linear density AAV1: 0.05 ± 0.04, AAV2: 0.98 ± 0.2, AAV5: 2.38 ± 1.24, AAV8: 1.43 
± 1.43, AAV9: 1.98 ± 0.86, DJ: 24.82 ± 14.32, CAV-2: 5.56 ± 4.13, n=3 to 5 each; Figure 
2D, Figure S2). The poor performance by the common AAV serotypes could not have arisen 
simply as a result of differences in infectivity since even the serotypes displaying similar 
labeling efficiency at the injection site to that of rAAV2-retro (rAAV2, rAAV9) did not 
permit efficient retrograde access to corticopontine neurons (Figure S3). Strikingly, the 
density of cortical projection neurons labeled by rAAV2-retro was comparable to that 
achieved with Fluoro-Gold (Schmued and Fallon, 1986), a robust synthetic retrograde tracer 
(linear density 81.03 ± 11.08 neurons/mm, n=3). Thus, rAAV2-retro exhibits up to two 
orders of magnitude enhancement over existing serotypes in retrograde access to 
corticopontine projection neurons, and rivals the efficacy of synthetic retrograde tracers.
Generality of retrograde functionality
We next examined whether the retrograde functionality of rAAV2-retro extended to other 
circuits, specifically by characterizing the extent to which it labeled various afferents to the 
dorsomedial striatum (DMS) – a part of the basal ganglia that receives long-range inputs 
from a variety of cortical and subcortical areas (Pan et al., 2010). We found that the efficacy 
of rAAV2-retro-mediated retrograde access to the strongest afferent inputs into DMS—
cortex, thalamus and amygdala—was comparable to that of fluorescent beads classically 
used for retrograde tracing (Figure 3A). To provide an unbiased estimate for the number of 
retrogradely labeled neurons in all brain areas known to provide significant long-range input 
to the DMS, we next assigned any detected fluorescent label in an imaged section of the 
mouse brain to specific brain areas by aligning the section to the annotated Allen Brain Atlas 
(Figure 3B–C). Quantitative analysis (Figure 3B-C) revealed that strong retrograde labeling 
was found in the vast majority of regions that have been previously reported to send 
prominent projections to the striatum (Pan et al., 2010). In one noticeable exception, only 
modest labeling was observed in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), despite it being 
the source of a strong dopaminergic input to the DMS (Figure 3C, arrow at cell count for 
SNc). A small subset of projection neuron classes was found to be similarly refractory to 
retrograde access by rAAV2-retro in some of the other circuits tested (Table S2; note that all 
other AAV serotypes tested also failed to label these projections). Despite these exceptions, 
rAAV2-retro is broadly applicable for retrograde access to projection neurons within the 
central nervous system. We note that no rAAV2-retro-mediated labeling of unexpected 
pathways has been reported to date (Table S2), however additional studies will be necessary 
to fully rule out its ability to infect axons of passage.
Retrograde access to genetically defined neuronal populations
We also determined whether the retrograde functionality of rAAV2-retro could be combined 
with the specificity of Cre transgenic lines to enable the interrogation of specific classes of 
Tervo et al.

 projection neurons. Specifically, we asked whether we could combine rAAV2-retro and Cre 
transgenic lines to segregate two functionally distinct long-range connections that run in 
parallel between two brain areas. Projections from cerebral cortex to the striatum arise 
primarily from neurons in layer V but some neurons in layers II and III also provide striatal 
inputs. It has been suggested that inputs to the striatum from different cortical layers 
constitute separate pathways, with neurons in layer V projecting to the patch compartment 
of the striatum, and neurons in layers II and III to the matrix (Gerfen, 1989). The 
interdigitated nature of patch and matrix micro-compartments makes it difficult to 
selectively target these pathways for functional interrogation with the rAAV2-retro system 
alone. We therefore explored whether we could segregate the two inputs by combining 
rAAV2-retro with a transgenic line that expresses Cre recombinase in most layer V neurons 
(Gerfen et al., 2013), but not in neurons in layers II and III (Figure 4A).
To highlight both pathways in the same experiment, we chose a Cre-dependent color-
flipping payload, which expresses tdTomato in the absence of Cre, but inverts to drive the 
expression of EGFP in Cre-positive cells (Saunders et al., 2012). When rAAV2-retro 
carrying this payload was injected into the dorsomedial striatum of a layer V-specific Cre 
driver line, Rbp4_KL100 Cre (Gerfen et al., 2013), layer V, but not layer II/III, neurons 
projecting to the striatum were robustly labeled with EGFP. Furthermore, the corticostriatal 
pathway originating in layer II/III was clearly distinguishable by the expression of tdTomato 
(Figure 4B). In accordance with the topographic nature of the corticostriatal projection, 
highly localized injections of the virus into the dorsomedial striatum led to a labeling of 
correspondingly small sections of the cortex. Cortical regions with selective layer II/III 
labeling were not observed, however, suggesting that the two pathways from the same 
cortical area traverse through the neighboring matrix and patch micro-compartments within 
striatum.
While this experiment highlighted both pathways, choosing a “Cre-on” or a “Cre-off” 
payload will permit selective interrogation of one at the exclusion of the other. This example, 
therefore, highlights the added specificity of circuit interrogation that can be achieved by 
combining a highly efficient retrograde virus with available Cre (or Flp) driver lines.
UsingrAAV2-retro for circuit interrogation and gene manipulation
The utility of rAAV2-retro for circuit interrogation will depend on its ability to mediate high 
levels of expression of genetically encoded indicators and effectors. We first assessed the 
ability to monitor neural activity in defined classes of projection neurons, through rAAV2-
retro-mediated expression of GCaMP6f (Chen et al., 2013) (Figure 5A-C). Using in vivo 
two-photon Ca2+ imaging, we detected dendritic and somatic Ca2+ transients in the primary 
motor cortex as early as 7 days after viral delivery to the BPN (Figure 5D). The temporal 
profile of Ca2+ signals reflected the structure of a cued reaching task, with the signal in 
many corticopontine neurons being tightly linked to the “go” cue (Figure 5E–F) (Li et al., 
2015). Repeated recordings from identified neurons were possible both across trials within a 
session early in the expression time course (Figure 5E, F), and across many behavioral 
sessions for over two months post-infection. Thus, rAAV2-retro confers the ability to 
express sensors in projection neurons at levels sufficient for imaging, creating many new

 opportunities for deciphering the contributions of specific projections to neural circuit 
computations.
Finally, we evaluated the utility of rAAV2-retro for delivery of effectors, such as the 
CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system, to projection neurons (Figure 6). Specifically, we 
packaged into rAAV2-retro the Staphylococcus aureus Cas9 (SaCas9, (Slaymaker et al., 
2016)) and a single guide RNA designed to ablate the expression of tdTomato (Experimental 
Procedures). Delivery of rAAV2-retro-SaCas9-anti-tdTomato to the BPN of animals 
expressing tdTomato in cortical layer V excitatory neurons resulted in suppression of 
tdTomato expression in 88.6 ± 0.7% of SaCas9-expressing layer V neurons (Figure 6B, 
bottom panel and Figure 6C, n=3). In contrast, delivery of a non-targeted SaCas9 did not 
lead to any discernible changes, with only 4.4 ± 3.2% of cells displaying potential reduction 
in tdTomato expression (Figure 6B, top panel, and Figure 6C, n=3). Furthermore, tdTomato 
expression remained unaffected in layer V neurons that were inaccessible via pontine 
injection. The rAAV2-retro system thus permits efficient gene modification selectively in 
neurons projecting to specific areas of interest.
Collectively, these observations establish rAAV2-retro as an effective reagent to genetically 
access projection neurons for functional interrogation of neural circuits and, in the long run, 
for possible therapeutics.
Discussion
Recombinant adeno-associated viruses (rAAVs) can greatly facilitate the functional 
dissection of mammalian neural circuits, and hold promise for therapeutic intervention in 
disorders of the nervous system. We have used directed evolution to endow the AAV capsid 
with the additional capacity for efficient retrograde access to projection neurons in many 
neural circuits. The newly engineered rAAV2-retro offers up to two orders of magnitude 
enhancement in retrograde transport compared to commonly used AAV serotypes, matching 
the efficacy of synthetic retrograde tracers in many circuits. The level of transgene 
expression achieved with rAAV2-retro via retrograde access is ample for interrogating 
neural circuit function, as well as for targeted manipulations of the neuronal genome. Thus, 
by enabling selective monitoring and manipulation of projection neurons connecting 
different brain areas, rAAV2-retro based tools are poised to provide insights into how large-
scale networks enable brain function, and may form the basis for future therapeutic 
intervention in diseases characterized by progressive large-scale network dysfunction.
The markedly increased efficacy of retrograde access afforded by rAAV2-retro compared to 
its parental serotype AAV2 might have been enabled through an insertion-mediated 
disruption of the native binding site for heparin and/or through the creation of a new binding 
surface that incorporates the inserted peptide. This variant does have reduced heparin affinity 
(Figure S4), which could decrease virus sequestration in the extracellular matrix of the 
synaptic cleft and enhance local vector spread, as has been observed with rAAV1 and 
rAAV6 (Arnett et al., 2013). However, the resulting increase in vector spread alone cannot 
explain the efficacy of retrograde transport, as other inserted 7-mer sequences disrupt 
heparin binding similarly but do not affect retrograde transport (Dalkara et al., 2013). 
Tervo et al.

 Furthermore, rAAV5 and rAAV9 do not bind heparin, yet their retrograde transport 
efficiency is similar to that of rAAV2. In support of the alternative explanation, the peptide 
insertions selected in the original selection (LAxxDxTKxA/LAxDxTKxxA) share the same 
overall composition, differing simply in the register of the conserved motif. The engineered 
peptide insertion might support enhanced binding to an existing cellular co-factor in the 
AAV pathway (e.g. the recently identified common AAV receptor (Pillay et al., 2016)), or it 
might create a novel interaction with the cellular machinery such as a cell surface receptor 
and/or a component of the vesicular trafficking or nuclear entry pathway. Further 
experiments will be required to elucidate the mechanism of the profound enhancement in the 
efficacy of retrograde transport.
Despite the multiple orders of magnitude improvement in retrograde transport that rAAV2-
retro offers over existing serotypes, a small set of projection neuron classes appears 
refractory to efficient retrograde infection by this newly evolved rAAV variant (Table S2). It 
should be noted, however, that other AAV serotypes fail to label these projections as well. 
Whether the expression level of the critical cellular factor that interfaces with this novel 
AAV variant in these neurons is just extremely low—a conclusion supported for the 
corticothalamic and corticocollicular projections, for instance, by the observation that 
rAAV2-retro could still deliver sufficient Cre recombinase to cell bodies to direct high-level 
of expression for locally delivered Cre-dependent payloads (Table S2, highlighted entries)—
or whether the factor is missing entirely, remains to be determined in each case. Other viral 
reagents with retrograde functionality (such as HSV1 (Enquist et al., 1998) or Hi-Ret 
lentivirus (Kato et al., 2010)) might prove useful for targeting some of these projection 
neuron classes. Alternatively, additional AAV capsid engineering could extend retrograde 
transduction to all neurons.
Since gaining access to individual classes of projection neurons will be a critical enabling 
step in elucidating how local circuit dynamics and large-scale network function are 
coordinated, the rAAV2-retro vector system provides an important addition to the genetic 
toolkit for dissecting neural circuit function. Local circuit computations are increasingly 
thought to depend on the dynamics of the entire neuronal population within a particular local 
circuit module (Fusi et al., 2016). How these dynamics map onto the different classes of 
projection neurons—and thus what information is passed on to the different downstream 
targets—remains unresolved for most circuits. rAAV2-retro based vectors, alone or in 
combination with specific Cre transgenic lines, permit genetic access to specific populations 
of projections neurons. In turn, rAAV2-retro carrying rabies G glycoprotein can be used to 
trans-complement conditional rabies vectors (e.g. the newly developed, less toxic version 
described by Reardon et al., 2016) for access to presynaptic microcircuits impinging on 
particular classes of projection neurons (Brown and Hestrin, 2009). The resulting ability to 
selectively monitor and manipulate activity of individual projection neuron classes and their 
local microcircuits should provide insight into how projection neurons translate local circuit 
dynamics for their respective large-scale networks.
rAAV2-retro also holds promise for therapeutic intervention, with several possible 
applications. For example, in situations where pathology impacts large volumes of neural 
tissue—such as Alzheimer's or lysosomal storage diseases—multiple injections pose a safety

 risk and may be insufficient to achieve the needed levels of transduction. However, a small 
number of injections in strategic locations can enable vector dispersal over large volumes 
(e.g. corticopontine tract from the point of convergence in the BPN), or difficult-to-access 
tissue (e.g. spinal motor neurons from the muscle (Kaspar et al., 2003)). Furthermore, large-
scale functional networks have been implicated in the spread of many neurodegenerative 
disorders from their spatially localized onset. A prominent emerging view posits that 
deposition of abnormal protein assemblies in vulnerable neuronal populations triggers a 
pathological cascade of aberrant neuronal activity within, and disintegration of, large-scale 
functional networks, ultimately leading to failure of neurological functions (for a recent 
review see (Brettschneider et al., 2015)). Intriguingly, the affected neural networks appear 
capable of transiently overcoming the aberrant dynamics early in the disease, as patients 
with many neurodegenerative diseases often display periods of dramatic improvement. Thus, 
early intervention aimed at slowing down the spread of aggregates from the cortical origin of 
pathology might be sufficient to stabilize, or even restore, cognitive function. From this 
perspective, subcortically-projecting neurons in the mesocortical regions where pathological 
protein aggregates first appear, in both Alzheimer's (Braak and Braak, 1996) and Parkinson's 
(Braak et al., 2003) disorders, constitute an attractive intervention target. Accessing those 
projection neurons with rAAV2-retro-based tools designed, for instance, to introduce a 
mutation that is capable of arresting further aggregation in cis (Gregoire et al., 2014) or to 
deliver chaperones capable of dissembling the aggregates (Jackrel et al., 2014) thus has the 
potential to slow down the progression of the most debilitating, cognitive, symptoms. 
Evaluating the efficiency and long-term safety of rAAV2-retro reagents in non-human 
primates will pave the path to their eventual consideration for these, and other, gene therapy 
approaches.
Experimental Procedures
All procedures were in accordance with protocols approved by the Janelia Research Campus 
and the University of California Berkeley Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees.
Library generation and viral production
Four previously generated virus libraries were used at the start of the directed evolution 
procedure: 1) a random mutagenesis library, generated by subjecting the AAV2 cap gene

(Maheshri et al., 2006); 2) library of AAV2 cap gene variants containing 7-mer randomized 
peptide within a 10-mer insert of the form LAXXXXXXXA between N587 and R588 
(Müller et al., 2003); 3) library of AAV2 cap gene variants containing randomized loop 
regions (Koerber et al., 2009); and 4) a DNA shuffling library generated from wild-type 
AAV1, AAV2, AAV4, AAV5, AAV6, AAV8 and AAV9 cap gene sequences (Koerber et al., 
2008). Each pool of mutant DNA had been originally sub-cloned into the replication-
competent AAV packaging plasmid to create a viral plasmid library that, when packaged 
into AAV virions, can be selected for any new property or function. The replication-
competent AAV system incorporates the mutant cap gene into the viral payload, and thus the 
genotype of each variant is linked to its phenotype. Capsid sequences of the desired property 
can then be recovered by DNA sequence analysis of the encapsulated AAV genome.

 The four replication-competent AAV libraries were packaged by calcium phosphate transient 
transfection of HEK293-T cells followed by virus harvest, iodixanol gradient centrifugation, 
and Amicon filtration (Maheshri et al., 2006).
In vivo virus or tracer injections
For virusinjections, ∼50-100 nl (mice) or ∼250-500nl (rats) of virus-containing solution was 
slowly injected at each depth into the tissue. For tracer injections, 50 nl of 5% Fluoro-Gold 
(Fluorochrome, Denver, CO) in 0.9% NaCl, or 100 nl of retrobeads (LumaFluor, Durham, 
NC) diluted 1:1 in 0.9% NaCl were injected at the same set of sites for each injection target.
Library selection and evolution
The four mutant virus libraries were pooled and injected either into the SNr or into the 
cerebellum of adult (6-8 week old) wild-type C57/Bl6J mice (either sex; Charles River). 
Three weeks following injections, striatal or hindbrain tissue was accordingly removed, 
DNA was extracted, and virions that had successfully reached the remote retrograde target 
tissue were PCR-amplified and recloned into an rcAAV packaging plasmid to create a new 
replication competent AAV library for the next round of selection. After three selection 
steps, the rescued cap genes were randomly mutated by error prone PCR using 5′-
ACGCGGAAGCTTCGATCAACTACGCAG-3′ and 5′-
AGACCAAAGTTCAACTGAAACGAATTAAACGG-3′ as forward and reverse primers, 
respectively. Two additional in vivo selection rounds were then performed. Individual 
isolates were sequenced after rounds 4 and 5 to evaluate the degree of library enrichment 
(Table S1). Seventeen variants were chosen for secondary screening at the end of round five, 
and the corresponding cap gene sequences were re-cloned into an rAAV helper plasmid. 
Individual high-titer preps of the parental wild type AAV2 and of each of the seventeen 
chosen mutant variants carrying a CMV-EGFP payload were then performed by Vector 
BioLabs, Inc (Philadelphia, PA). The CMV promoter is typically weak in neurons, and thus 
this secondary screen provided a stringent test of the efficiency of retrograde transport. The 
individual AAV variants were injected either into the cerebellum or into the globus pallidus. 
After three weeks, endogenous, unamplified EGFP fluorescence was visualized in the 
regions expected to be labeled if retrograde transport was efficient. Mutant r5H6 (insert 
LADQDYTKTA + V708I + N382D) displayed the strongest retrograde transport in both 
circuits, and was thus chosen for further analysis and named rAAV2-retro (see Supplemental 
Information for the complete gene sequence).
Payloads and promoters used in the study
For all subsequent experiments, the CMV promoter was replaced with a promoter known to 
be more robust in adult neurons. Cre recombinase and the GCaMP6f calcium sensor were 
driven by the human Synapsin-1 (hSyn1) promoter; all of the fluorophores were driven by 
the CAG promoter; and the color-flipping construct was driven by the EF1α promoter.
Virus production for the quantification of retrograde efficiency
hSyn-Cre payload was packaged using rAAV1, rAAV2, rAAV5, rAAV8, rAAV9, DJ and 
rAAV2-retro capsids at the Janelia Virus Shared Resource. All seven virus preparations were

 processed in parallel, and were titer matched before in vivo injections. All lots were diluted 
to the lowest measured titer (1.3 E12 GC/ml), and each virus was injected into the right 
pontine nucleus of three to five adult Rosa26-Lox-STOP-Lox-H2B-EGFP mice (He et al., 
2012).
Histology
Animals were sacrificed two-three weeks following virus injections, at which point the 
brains were harvested and the right hemisphere was sagittally sectioned at a thickness of 50 
μm. In the triple labeling experiment in Figure 1B and Movie S1, the fluorphores were 
antibody-amplified; otherwise, unstained sections were used. The sections were mounted in 
VECTASHIELD Antifade Mounting Medium containing DAPI (Vector Laboratories), and 
imaged using a P-E Pannoramic slide scanner (3D Histech) using a 20× objective and FITC 
and DAPI filters.
Retrograde transport quantification
To quantify retrograde transport, the extent of corticopontine labeling was assessed in 
sagittal sections lateral to the injection tract (∼1 mm lateral with respect to midline) taken 
from Rosa26-Lox-STOP-Lox-H2B-EGFP animals injected in the basal pons with various 
AAV serotypes carrying a Cre recombinase transgene. Images obtained with the Pannoramic 
slide scanner were stitched together and then analyzed using custom software written in 
Matlab (Mathworks) to detect the GFP-labeled nuclei across the cortex.
For each chosen sagittal section, a region of interest (ROI) was manually drawn around the 
cortex to isolate the area in the image for automated cell counting. To enhance the detection 
of nuclei, the image was then convolved with a “Mexican Hat” kernel comprising the 
difference of two Gaussians (26.00 μm variance and 3.25 μm variance). Image noise was 
reduced using a median filter, and peak detection was then performed. Linear density was 
computed as the number of labeled nuclei per mm of the total length of a line drawn 
manually to trace the outline of cortical layer V.
Quantification of infection efficiency at the injection site
For rAAV2, rAAV9 and rAAV2-retro, additional analysis of infection efficiency at the 
injection site was performed. A single sagittal section spanning the middle of the injection 
site—as judged by the presence of extensive labeling along the injection tract—was chosen 
for each of the injected brains. The green channel was convolved with the “Mexican Hat” 
kernel (see above), and peaks were then detected as local maxima on these threshold images 
using custom functions written in Matlab. An ROI was drawn over the midbrain area 
containing the basal pontine nuclei but excluding the injection tract, and the total number of 
labeled nuclei within the ROI was tabulated.
Analysis of the generality of retrograde transport
Rosa26-Lox-STOP-Lox-H2B-EGFP mice were injected with 25 nl of rAAV2-retro hSyn1-
Cre (1.3E12 GC/ml) in the dorsal striatum. Three weeks after injection, coronally-sectioned 
brains were imaged using a Pannoramic Scanner to visualize DAPI stained nuclei and green 
fluorescence from H2B-GFP expressing nuclei. The green channel was similarly used for

 the detection of labeled nuclei (see above). The blue channel of each section was aligned to 
the Nissl images from the Allen Brain Institute's standardized mouse brain atlas using 
custom analysis routines written with the help of the Matlab Image Processing Toolbox. The 
annotated regions from the Allen Brain Institute's mouse brain atlas were then used to assign 
detected neurons in aligned sections to specific brain regions (Kuan et al., 2015).
We note that finite precision of the reference atlas together with anatomical variability of 
individual brains limit the robustness of this semi-automated process to prominent afferent 
inputs.
Imaging of neuronal population activity in vivo following retrograde delivery of GCaMP6f
Seven adult mice were implanted with custom-made headposts as previously described 
(Osborne and Dudman, 2014). rAAV2-retro carrying a hSyn1-GCaMP6f (1.0E13 GC/ml) 
payload was injected into the BPN using a Nanoliter 2010 injector (World Precision 
Instruments). A cranial window was placed over the primary motor cortex. All animals had 
visually identifiable GCaMP6f expressing cells in layer V of M1 one-week post injection. 
Then the animals were habituated to head fixation in a custom-built apparatus, trained to 
retrieve a food pellet as previously described (Guo et al., 2015). Calcium transients during 
behavior were imaged by exciting GCaMP6f at 920 nm. Emission light passed through a 
565 DCXR dichroic filter (Chroma Technology) and an ET525/70m-2p filter (Chroma 
Technology) and was detected by a GaAsP photomultiplier tube (10770PB-40, Hamamatsu). 
Images (512 × 512 pixels) were acquired at ∼30 Hz with resonating scanners using 
ScanImage software.
CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing
The CMV promoter in pAAV-CMV-SaCas9-empty (Slaymaker et al., 2016) was replaced 
with hSyn1 to generate pAAV-hSyn1-SaCas9-empty. Oligonucleotides encoding sgRNA 
protospacer sequences were custom ordered, phosphorylated, hybridized and ligated into the 
BsaI restriction sites of pAAV-hSyn1-SaCas9-emtpy to generate pAAV-hSyn1-SaCas9-
tdTomato-1 to -10 (see Supplemental Information for oligonucleotide sequences tested and 
details of the in vitro selection procedure). sgRNA 7—one of two that appeared to direct two 
cleavage events within the tdTomato sequence in vitro—was packaged into AAV2-retro and 
used for in vivo genome editing.
Approximately 100 nl of rAAV2-retro-hSyn1-SaCas9-tdTomato (5.0 E13 GC/ml) or rAAV2-
retro-hSyn1-SaCas9-empty was then injected into the BPN of Rbp4_KL100 Cre × tdTomato 
mice as described above. Six weeks after injections, brains were harvested and 40 μm-thick 
coronal sections were cut, stained against the HA-tagged Cas9 and imaged using a Zeiss 
Axio Observer A1 inverted microscope. Quantification of immunostaining was performed 
using ImageJ analysis software (NIH).

 Figure 1. Directed evolution of rAAV2-retro
(A) Schematic of the directed evolution procedure. Plasmid libraries containing variant AAV 
cap genes previously generated by error prone PCR, peptide insertion, randomization of loop 
regions, and DNA shuffling were packaged, and the resulting viral vector libraries were 
injected into substantia nigra or cerebellar cortex. Three weeks later, striatal or hindbrain, 
respectively, tissues were removed, viral genomes isolated, and selected cap genes amplified 
and packaged for the next round of selection.(B) Example retrograde labeling of projection 
neurons with the final chosen variant, rAAV2-retro. Retrograde access to intermingled sub-
populations of neurons in various brain regions projecting to three striatal compartments was 
assessed two weeks after delivery of rAAV2-retro carrying different fluorescent proteins into 
the corresponding axonal fields. rAAV2-retro-tdTomato was injected into dorsolateral 
striatum (DLS), rAAV2-retro Ruby2_FLAG into dorsomedial striatum (DMS), and rAAV2-
retro EGFP into ventrolateral striatum (VLS). Unlike in subsequent experiments (see Figures 
2-6), the three probes were visualized by immunohistochemistry to ensure robust detection 
of retrograde transport at this early time point. Ctx: cortex; BLA: basolateral amygdala; IL 
TH: intralaminar thalamic nuclei; CL: centrolateral thalamic nucleus; CM: centromedial 
thalamic nucleus. Scale bar: 1mm. See also Figures S1 and S4, and Movie S1.

 Figure 2. Quantification of retrograde transport efficiency
(A) Efficient labeling of the corticopontine tract throughout the rostro-caudal axis via basal 
pontine injection of rAAV2-retro-DIO-CAG-tdTomato in a layer V-specific Cre mouse line 
(Rbp4_KL100 Cre). Top panel: schematic of the experiment. Injection site was marked by 
co-injecting rAAV1-CAG-EGFP. BPN: Basal pontine nuclei. Bottom panel: unamplified 
tdTomato and EGFP expression three weeks after injection. Scale bar: 1 mm. (B) 
Quantification assay design. Top panel: schematic of the experiment. Corticopontine 
labeling was assessed in sagittal sections lateral to the injection tract (∼1 mm lateral with 
respect to midline) taken from Rosa26-Lox-STOP-Lox-H2B-EGFP animals injected in the 
BPN with various AAV serotypes carrying Cre recombinase transgene. Arrow indicates 
expected nuclear GFP labeling in cortical neurons of the corticopontine tract. Middle panel: 
representative image of an rAAV2-injected brain. Bottom panel: representative image of 
rAAV2-retro-injected brain. Scale bar for both the panels: 1 mm. (C) Schematic of the semi-
automated quantification procedure. Fluorescent nuclei (green) were automatically detected 
and counted along a manually drawn line that traced the length of cortical layer V (black). 
(D) Retrograde transport efficiency for different AAV serotypes and for canine adenovirus 
type 2 (CAV-2) (See Experimental Procedures). Error bars represent the S.E.M. See also 
Figures S2 and S3.

 Figure 3. Generality of retrograde transport afforded by rAAV2-retro
(A) Representative images showing extensive labeling in the main input structures to the 
dorsal striatum including cortex (panel 1), amygdala (panel 3), and thalamus (panel 4). Scale 
bars: 800 micrometers for panels 1 and 2,200 micrometers for panels 3 and 4.Ctx: cortex; 
CP: caudate/putamen; BLA: basolateral amygdala; Th: thalamus; (B) Schematic of 
automated whole-brain quantification of retrograde labeling. Brains of Rosa26-LSL-H2B-
EGFP injected with rAAV2-retro-hSyn1-Cre were imaged to visualize DAPI stained nuclei 
and green fluorescence from H2B-GFP expressing nuclei. The green channel was used to 
detect labeled neurons; the blue channel was aligned to the Nissl images from the Allen 
Brain Institute's standard mouse brain (see Experimental Procedures). The alignment 
permitted detected neurons to be assigned to different regions using the annotation provided 
by the brain atlas. Scale bar: 1.25 mm. (C) Whole-brain quantification of retrograde labeling 
out of a small region of the dorsomedial striatum. Abbreviations for the different brain areas 
are given according to the Allen Brain Atlas. Arrow highlights the SNc. Error bars represent 
the S.E.M.

 Figure 4. Combining rAAV2-retro system with Cre driver lines for selective access to parallel 
corticostriatal pathways
(A) Schematic of the experiment. rAAV2-retro carrying a Cre-dependent color flipping 
fluorescent reporter was injected into the striatum of a cortical layer V-specific Cre line. (B) 
Two corticostriatal pathways differentially labeled through a Cre-dependent inversion of the 
reporter in one (layer V), but not the other (layer II/III), pathway. A presumed Cre-
independent inversion— typical for all AAV vectors—was observed in a small fraction of 
corticostriatal neurons in layer II/III (white arrows). Scale bar: 50 micrometers.

 Figure 6. rAAV2-retro system enables in vivo genome editing using CRISPR/Cas9
(A) Schematic of the experiment. Top panel: The rAAV2-retro system was used to deliver 
Staphylococcus aureus Cas9 (SaCas9) single guide RNA combination engineered to ablate 
expression of tdTomato. Bottom panel: rAAV2-retro carrying the SaCas9-anti-tdTomato 
payload was injected into the BPN of mice expressing tdTomato from a single genomic 
locus in layer V neurons. SaCas9 was epitope tagged, permitting identification of 
retrogradely labeled neurons (green channel). Upward arrows: expected labeling following 
successful ablation of tdTomato. Downward arrows: expected labeling if tdTomato 
expression is unaffected. (B) Representative images from brain sections of animals that 
received the CRISPR/Cas9 system targeted against tdTomato or carrying a non-targeted 
guide. tdT: tdTomato. Scale bar: 50 micrometers. (C) Efficiency of ablation. Error bars 
represent the S.E.M.
