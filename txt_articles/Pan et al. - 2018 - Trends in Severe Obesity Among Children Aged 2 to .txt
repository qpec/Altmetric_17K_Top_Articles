IMPORTANCE Severe obesity in childhood is associated with negative health consequences.
A previous study examined trends in severe obesity among preschool-aged children in
low-income families during 1998 to 2010. No recent trends have been reported.
OBJECTIVE To examine trends in severe obesity by age, sex, and race/ethnicity among
enrollees in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children
(WIC) aged 2 to 4 years during 2000 to 2014.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Serial cross-sectional data from 22.6 million young
children enrolled in WIC from 50 states, the District of Columbia, and 5 US territories from
2000 to 2014. Data analysis was conducted from February 16, 2017, to March 9, 2017.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Prevalence of severe obesity. Severe obesity was defined as
a sex-specific body mass index-for-age 120% or more of the 95th percentile on the 2000
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention growth charts. Children’
s weights and heights
were measured. Children whose sex, weight, height, or body mass index was missing or
biologically implausible were excluded.
RESULTS The prevalence of severe obesity was 1.96% in 2014. During 2000 to 2004, the
prevalence increased significantly overall from 1.80% to 2.11% (adjusted prevalence
difference [APD], 0.26%) and among all the age, sex, and racial/ethnic groups except for
Asian/Pacific Islander (APD, 0.05%-0.54% across groups with increases). The largest relative
increase occurred in children aged 4 years (adjusted prevalence ratio [APR], 1.21) and
non-Hispanic white (APR, 1.22) and American Indian/Alaska Native children (APR, 1.19).
During 2004 to 2010, the prevalence decreased significantly overall (APD, −0.05%), among
boys, children aged 2 and 3 years, and non-Hispanic black and Asian/Pacific Islander children
(APD, −0.05% to −0.18%). During 2010 to 2014, the prevalence decreased significantly
overall from 2.12% to 1.96% (APD, −0.14%) and among all demographic groups (APD, −0.04%
to −0.30% across groups). The largest relative decrease occurred in children aged 2 years
(APR, 0.88) and Hispanic (APR, 0.92), American Indian/Alaska Native (APR, 0.89), and
Asian/Pacific Islander (APR, 0.87) children.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study provides updated prevalence and trends of severe
obesity among young children enrolled in WIC and reports recent modest declines in severe
obesity in all subgroups. Ongoing surveillance can assess whether declines continue into the
future among low-income children.

 C
hildhood obesity remains a public health concern. Data
from the National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES) indicated that obesity prevalence in-
creased from 7.2% in 1988 to 1994 to 13.9% in 2003-2004 and
then decreased to 9.4% in 2013 to 2014 among children aged
2 to 5 years.1 Despite the recent declines, the prevalence of
childhood obesity remains high, especially among children liv-
ing in low-income families because obesity disproportionally
affects this vulnerable group.2,3 According to a previous Cen-
ters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) study, the preva-
lence of obesity was 14.5% among young children who were
enrolled in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for
Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) in 2014.3 Obesity and se-
vere obesity in childhood have been associated with other car-
diovascular risk factors, impaired glucose tolerance, respira-
tory problems, increased health care costs, and premature
death.4-7Thosewhohaveobesityorsevereobesityduringearly
childhood are also likely to have obesity during middle or late
childhood, and obesity often persists into adulthood.8,9 Adults
who have obesity and severe obesity are at increased risk for
stroke, coronary heart disease, diabetes, and many other com-
mon and costly chronic diseases.10
In the United States, 1.7% of children aged 2 to 5 years had
severeobesityin2011to2014.1Childrenwithsevereobesityface
even greater health and social challenges; for example, the
prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors increases with the se-
verity of childhood obesity.5 Children with a body mass index
(BMI) over the 99th percentile (calculated as weight in kilo-
gramsdividedbyheightinmeterssquared)areatincreasedrisk
forcardiovasculardisease,andthelikelihoodofadipositytrack-
ingintoadulthoodisextremelyhigh.5Theselifelonghealthrisks
associated with severe obesity during early childhood indicate
theimportanceofpreventingandidentifyingsevereobesity.On-
going surveillance among children enrolled in WIC can help to
evaluate the effectiveness of obesity prevention efforts among
childrenfromlow-incomefamilies.Onepreviousanalysisusing
CDC Pediatric Nutrition Surveillance System (PedNSS) data
found that the prevalence of severe obesity increased during
1998to2003anddecreasedslightlyduring2003to2010among
children aged 2 to 4 years who were enrolled in WIC and other
nutrition and health programs.11 The CDC stopped operation of
PedNSS in 2012, and no updated prevalence and secular trends
have been reported since then. In this study, we used the WIC
Participant and Program Characteristics (WIC PC) data col-
lected by the US Department of Agriculture to examine the
prevalence and trends of severe obesity among children aged
2to4yearswhowereenrolledinWICfrom2000through2014.
Methods
Study Population
The WIC PC is a biennial census of US WIC enrollees who are
certified to receive benefits in April of the even years. It is used
tomonitorthenutritionalstatusoflow-incomepregnant,post-
partum, and breastfeeding women and children younger than
5 years who are enrolled in WIC. The program is administered
in each state or territory by state health departments or Indian
tribal organizations. To be eligible, WIC applicants must live in
the state where they apply and have certain medical or dietary
conditions.Furthermore,applicantsneedtohaveagrosshouse-
hold income 185% or less of the US poverty level or have proof
of participation in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Pro-
gram,TemporaryAssistanceforNeedyFamilies,orMedicaid.12
The initial study population contained 22.8 million chil-
dren aged 2 to 4 years who were enrolled in WIC state agen-
cies in 50 states, the District of Columbia, and 5 US territories
during 2000 to 2014. Because certain prevalence in a state dif-
fered substantially from the estimates in adjacent years, we
used a robust regression model to predict annual prevalence
foreachstate.Weexcludedall24 472(0.11%)childrenfromHa-
waii in 2002 and 2004 because these prevalence estimates dif-
fered by more than 10 percentage points from the values pre-
dicted by a robust regression model. In addition, we excluded
1062 (0.005%) children whose weight and height were mea-
sured more than 1 year before the reporting year, and 194 526
(0.85%) whose sex, weight, height, or BMI were missing or bio-
logically implausible. Biologically implausible z Scores were
defined as height for age less than −5.0 or above 4.0, weight
for age less than −5.0 or above 8.0, and BMI for age less than
−4.0 or more than 8.0.13 The final analytic sample included
22 553 518children.Annualsamplesizesrangedfrom2 352 648
in 2000 to 3 307 442 in 2010. The study was exempt from eth-
ics reviews by the CDC and the US Department of Agriculture.
Children’s Anthropometric Measurements
Children’
s anthropometric measurements were taken by
trained staff during their certification or recertification visits.
Standard data collection and recording protocols were used in
all participating jurisdictions.14 Weights were reported to the
nearest quarter pound and heights to the nearest eighth inch.
Approximately 75% of the anthropometric data in the pres-
ent study were collected within 6 months before April of the
reporting year.
Documenting severe obesity has been inconsistent in the
past because of lack of a standard definition. One study pro-
posed that children with BMI over the 99th percentile be con-
sidered as having severe obesity because they are at elevated
Key Points
Question What were the trends in prevalence of severe obesity
among children aged 2 to 4 years who were enrolled in the Special
Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children
during 2010 to 2014?
Findings In this cross-sectional study of 22.6 million children aged
2 to 4 years, the overall adjusted prevalence of severe obesity
increased during 2000 to 2004, decreased slightly during 2004
to 2010, and decreased further during 2010 to 2014; all changes
were statistically significant. During 2010 to 2014, the prevalence
decreased significantly among all demographic groups.
Meaning The findings indicate recent progress in reducing the
prevalence of severe obesity among young children in the United
States enrolled in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for
Women, Infants, and Children.

Flegal and colleagues16 suggested approximating the empiri-
cal99thBMIpercentilebymultiplyingtheBMIvaluesatthe95th

canHeartAssociationrecommendedthatsevereobesityinchil-
dren aged 2 years or older and adolescents be defined as BMI
35 kg/m2 or more or 120% of the 95th percentile, whichever is
lower, based on age and sex.17 Because BMI 35 kg/m2 is a higher
threshold than BMI 120% or more of the 95th percentile for
youngchildren,17 theCDCusesacutoffof120%ofthe95thBMI
percentileforsevereobesity.13Inthisstudy,weadoptedtheCDC
definitionanddefinedsevereobesityassex-specificBMIforage
of120%ormoreofthe95thpercentileonthe2000CDCgrowth
charts. We further defined class II severe obesity as a BMI of
140% or more of the 95th percentile.
Statistical Analysis
SAS software, version 9.3 (SAS Institute) was used to esti-
mate the annual unadjusted prevalence of severe obesity from
2000 to 2014, both overall and by age (2, 3, or 4 years), sex,
and race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black,
Hispanic, American Indian/Alaska Native [AIAN], or Asian/
Pacific Islander [PI]).
We identified statistically significant changes in overall
secular trend of severe obesity using Joinpoint, version 4.3.1
(National Cancer Institute, https://surveillance.cancer.gov
/joinpoint). The Joinpoint regression fits a series of joined
straight lines on a logarithmic scale and identifies the best joint
pointswherestatisticallysignificantchangesoccur.18Thenum-
ber and location of significant join points is determined with
Monte Carlo samples from permuted data sets, with Bonfer-
roni adjustments to control for increases in type 1 errors.18 Data
analysiswasconductedfromFebruary16,2017,toMarch9,2017.
Because Joinpoint regression identified 2004 and 2010 as
the inflection years for overall trend of severe obesity, changes
inprevalencewerefurtheranalyzedfor3periods—2000to2004,
2004 to 2010, and 2010 to 2014—using SAS. To account for an-
nual differences in population distribution, log binomial
regression controlling for age, sex, and race/ethnicity was used
to estimate adjusted prevalence ratios (APRs), which repre-
sent relative changes in prevalence for the 3 periods. Adjusted
prevalencedifferences(APDs)werethencalculated([prevalence
atbeginningofperiod] × [APR] − [prevalenceatbeginningofpe-
riod]). We considered increases or decreases in prevalence sta-
tistically significant if the 95% CIs for APD did not include 0.

wider z Score cutoffs (height for age,<−5.0 or >7.0, weight for
age,<−5.0 or >9.0, and BMI for age,<−4.0 or >9.0).
Results
The demographic distribution of the study population was
slightly different in 2000, 2004, 2010, and 2014 (Table 1). In
2010 and 2014, there was a lower proportion of non-Hispanic
whitechildrenandhigherproportionsofHispanicandAsian/PI
children. Additionally, the 2004 and 2010 WIC enrollees had
a slightly lower proportion of non-Hispanic black children than
the enrollees in other years (Table 1).
During2000to2004,theoverallprevalenceofsevereobe-
sity increased significantly from 1.80% to 2.11% (APD, 0.26%)
(Figure and Table 2). The crude prevalence was similar in 2004
and 2010; however, there was a small but significant de-
crease from 2004 to 2010 after adjusting for age, sex, and race/
ethnicity (APD, −0.05%). During 2010 to 2014, the overall
prevalence decreased significantly from 2.12% to 1.96% (APD,
−0.14%) (Figure and Table 2).
Girls had a slightly higher prevalence of severe obesity in
all years than boys (Figure and Table 2). From 2000 to 2004,
the adjusted prevalence of severe obesity increased signifi-
cantly among boys and girls; the relative increase was greater
among boys than girls based on APRs (Table 2). From 2004 to
2010, the adjusted prevalence decreased significantly among

 boys but remained relatively unchanged among girls. How-
ever, from 2010 to 2014, the adjusted prevalence decreased
significantly among both groups (Figure and Table 2); the rela-
tive decrease was greater among boys than girls.
The prevalence of severe obesity increased with age.
Among children aged 2 and 3 years, the adjusted prevalence
increased significantly from 2000 to 2004 and decreased sig-
nificantly afterward. For children aged 4 years, the adjusted
prevalencewentupfrom2000to2004,levelledbetween2004
and 2010, and declined significantly from 2010 to 2014 (Figure
and Table 2). Children aged 2 years had the smallest relative
increase during 2000 to 2004 and the greatest relative de-
crease during 2010 to 2014 based on APRs (Table 2).
The prevalence of severe obesity in all years was highest
among AIAN and Hispanic children. During 2000 to 2004,
the adjusted prevalence increased significantly among all
the racial/ethnic groups except Asian/PI, for which the
adjusted prevalence remained relatively unchanged. The
largest relative increase occurred in non-Hispanic white and
AIAN children based on APRs (Table 2). During 2004-2010,
the adjusted prevalence declined significantly among non-
Hispanic black and Asian/PI children and levelled among
the remaining racial/ethnic groups. During 2010 to 2014, the
adjusted prevalence decreased significantly among all the
racial/ethnic groups (Figure and Table 2). The relative
decline was greater among Hispanic, AIAN, and Asian/PI
children than that among non-Hispanic white and non-
Hispanic black children.
ThetrendinoverallprevalenceofclassIIsevereobesitywas
similartothatforsevereobesityoverall.Theprevalenceofclass
II severe obesity increased significantly from 0.27% in 2000 to
0.33% in 2004, decreased slightly but significantly to 0.32% in
2010, and then further decreased to 0.30% in 2014.
Discussion
Ouranalysesfoundthattheprevalenceofsevereobesityamong
USWICenrolleesaged2to4yearsincreasedfrom2000to2004
and decreased from 2004 to 2014. For the first time, we found
that the decrease between 2010 and 2014 was statistically sig-
nificant in all age, sex, and racial/ethnic subgroups.
Previous research11 based on PedNSS data from 30 states
and the District of Columbia found that the prevalence of
severe obesity increased significantly during 1998 to 2003
overall and in all racial/ethnic groups except Asian/PI and de-
creased significantly during 2003 to 2010 overall and in all
racial/ethnic groups except AIAN. Unlike WIC PC, PedNSS
collecteddatainJanuarythroughDecembercalendaryearsand
did not have consistent data for all state agencies over time.
InadditiontoWICenrollees(>80%),PedNSSalsoincludedpar-
ticipants in other child health and nutrition programs in cer-
tain states.20 Although the present study based on WIC PC is
not directly comparable with the previous PedNSS research11
because of differences in methodology, the present study also
found a similar upward trend until 2004 and a downward
trend afterward for severe obesity overall. Furthermore, the
present study suggested that the overall decline continued to
2014 and a significant decrease between 2010 and 2014
occurred in all WIC population subgroups.
Previous studies have examined the prevalence of severe
obesity among young children from US families of all income

US children aged 2 to 5 years was 2.2% in 1999 to 200616,22 and
1.7% in 2011 to 2014.1 To compare our study results with the
NHANES prevalence estimate in a comparable age group, we
estimated the prevalence of severe obesity based on a sample
of5000childrenaged2to4yearswhoparticipatedinNHANES
from 1999 to 2014. We found that 1.4% of US children had se-
vere obesity, which was lower than the prevalence among WIC
enrollees included in our study. Skelton et al23 (severe obe-
sity defined as BMI≥99th percentile) and Claire Wang et al22
(severe obesity defined the same way as in the present study)
examined trends in severe obesity among NHANES partici-
pants aged 2 to 5 years and reported that the prevalence mark-

complex. Differences in genetic, behavioral, and environmen-
tal factors across years may have contributed to the decreases
in prevalence of severe obesity. A number of federal programs
promotedhealthfulfoodchoicesandincreasedsupportforfami-
lies and communities. For example, the US Department of
Agriculture promotes healthy eating and nutrition education
through many of its child nutrition programs, including the
Federal WIC Program. The US Department of Agriculture pub-
lished an interim rule in 2007 to revise the WIC food packages
by October 2009 to align more closely with updated nutrition
science, the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, and the in-
fant feeding practice guidelines of the American Academy of
Pediatrics.26,27Therevisedfoodpackagespromotedfruits,veg-

preferences.26StudieshavefoundthatchangestotheWICfood
packages have led to reductions in fruit juice purchases, in-
creasesinHealthyEatingIndexscoresandfruit,vegetable,and

communities, and improved WIC staff competence in provid-
ing counseling for children with overweight.28-31
Recommendations and activities from CDC and compre-
hensive public health strategies from the Institute of
Medicine32 to prevent and manage childhood obesity may
have also played important roles for the declining trends in
severe obesity. The CDC provided funding, training, and

a Defined as sex-specific body mass index for age 120% or more of the 95th
percentile on the 2000 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention growth
charts.
bCrude prevalence of severe obesity.
c Represents relative changes in prevalence of severe obesity between 2
inflection years; calculated from log binomial regression models adjusted for
age, sex, and race/ethnicity.
dCalculated as ([prevalence at beginning of period] × [adjusted prevalence
ratio] − [prevalence at beginning of period]).
e Includes data from all the WIC state agencies in 50 states, District of Columbia,
and 5 US territories except for Hawaii data in 2002 and 2004.
f Statistically significant change based on log binomial regression model
adjusted for age, sex, and race/ethnicity.

 technical assistance to a variety of state and community
agencies to increase access to healthful foods and more
opportunities for physical activity. The State Public
Health Actions grant funded all 50 states and the District
of Columbia on promoting breastfeeding, implementing
nutrition standards, and improving physical activity in
communities.33 The CDC provided technical support for
states to work with hospitals,34 and there have been
improved food and beverage and physical activity environ-
ments in hospitals34 and enhanced maternity care policies
and practices supportive of breastfeeding in birth facilities.35
Furthermore, the CDC provided resources and support for
Early Care and Education providers to embed Caring for Our
Children Standards for obesity prevention into state Early
Care and Education systems and increase their knowledge
about nutrition, breastfeeding, screen time, and physical
activity standards.36
Limitations
Our study is subject to at least 3 limitations. First, the study is
not representative of US children from families of all income
levels. Furthermore, only approximately 50% of WIC-eligible
young children were enrolled in WIC,37 so our findings may not
be representative of all low-income US children aged 2 to 4
years. In addition, we included only children enrolled in non-
tribal WIC programs; the observed trend in severe obesity
among AIAN children may not be representative of WIC en-
rollees in AIAN tribes. Second, although there is a high corre-
lation between BMI and body fat for children with higher BMI
levels, BMI does not precisely approximate adiposity or per-
centageofbodyfatinchildren.38Forexample,thelevelofbody
fat is lower among non-Hispanic black children than that
among non-Hispanic white children with the same BMI
levels.39 Our study findings did not account for differences in
body fat distributions across racial/ethnic groups. Third, our
findings may have been affected by our inclusion of children
with high BMIs but whose weight or height entries were
incorrect. We may have also excluded children valid for study
because their weight or BMI exceeded our upper cutoff points
for biological implausible values. However, our sensitivity
analyses using the narrower World Health Organization cut-
offs or the wider cutoffs for biologically implausible z Scores
indicated the same rate of increase from 2000 to 2004 and the
same rate of decrease from 2010 to 2014 in overall preva-
lence of severe obesity. However, the results based on the nar-
rower World Health Organization cutoffs showed no statisti-
cally significant change between 2004 and 2010 and the
analysis using the wider z Score cutoffs indicated a slightly
greater decrease in overall prevalence than the findings of the
present study for this time.
Conclusions
Our findings indicate recent progress in reducing the preva-
lence of severe obesity among young US children enrolled in
WIC. However, severe obesity in early childhood remains a
serious public health concern because of its common
adverse health and social consequences. Future surveil-
lance that monitors severe obesity and related behavioral
risk factors will help to determine whether the downward
trends in severe obesity are continuing in all groups and
whether racial/ethnic gaps in prevalence are narrowing.
More evaluative research could determine whether the
recent reversal in the prevalence of severe obesity may be
attributable to obesity prevention initiatives for all children
or to initiatives specifically targeting children enrolled in
WIC. Continued implementation of population-based strat-
egies to support environmental and policy change in health
care, Early Care and Education, and community settings,
and culturally appropriate intervention efforts focusing on
low-income children and their caregivers may be important
for further reducing the prevalence of severe obesity among
young children.
