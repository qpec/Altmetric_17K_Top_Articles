Abstract
Objective—Among older persons, disability and functional decline are associated with increased 
mortality, institutionalization, and costs. To determine whether illnesses and injuries leading to an 
emergency department (ED) visit but not hospitalization are associated with functional decline 
among community-living older persons.
Methods—From a cohort of 754 community-living older persons who have been followed with 
monthly interviews for up to 14 years, we matched 813 ED visits without hospitalization (ED-
only) to 813 observations without an ED visit or hospitalization (control). We compared the course 
of disability over the following 6 months between the 2 matched groups. To establish a frame of 
reference, we also compared the ED-only group with an unmatched group who were hospitalized 
after an ED visit (ED-hospitalized). Disability scores (range: 0 [lowest] to 13 [highest]) were 
compared using generalized linear models adjusted for relevant covariates. Admission to a nursing 
home and mortality were evaluated as secondary outcomes.
Results—The ED-only and control groups were well matched. For both groups, the mean age 
was 83.6 years, and 69% were female. The baseline disability scores were 3.4 and 3.6 in the ED-
only and control group, respectively. Over the 6-month follow-up period, the ED-only group had 
significantly higher disability scores than the control group, with an adjusted risk ratio (RR) of 
1.14 (95%CI, 1.09–1.19). Compared with participants in the ED-only group, those who were 
hospitalized after an ED visit had disability scores that were significantly higher (RR 1.17, 95%CI,

 1.12–1.22). Both nursing home admissions (HR 3.11, 95%CI, 2.05–4.72) and mortality (HR 1.93, 
95%CI 1.07–3.49) were also higher in the ED-only group versus control group over the 6-month 
follow-up period.
Conclusions—Although not as debilitating as an acute hospitalization, illnesses and injuries 
leading to an ED visit without hospitalization were associated with a clinically meaningful decline 
in functional status over the following 6 months, suggesting that the period after an ED visit 
represents a vulnerable time for community-living older persons.
INTRODUCTION
Background and Importance
Patients aged 65 years or older account for more than 15% of all emergency department 
(ED) visits each year in the United States,1 and most of these patients are discharged home.2 
Among older persons, disability and functional decline are associated with increased 
mortality, institutionalization, and costs.3,4,5 The estimated additional cost of medical and 
long-term care for newly disabled older persons in the United States is $26 billion per year.6
Previous work has shown that illnesses and injuries leading to hospitalization are associated 
with functional decline.4,7–9 Prior studies have also suggested that older patients discharged 
from the ED may experience some functional decline, but these studies were limited by the 
absence of suitable comparison groups and by retrospective reports of pre-illness 
function.10–16
Goals of this Investigation
The objective of this study was to evaluate the burden of disability over a 6-month period in 
older persons who were discharged from the ED (ED-only) by comparing them with a 
matched control group (control) and with a group that was admitted to the ED and 
hospitalized (ED-hospitalized). We hypothesized that older persons who visited the ED and 
were discharged would experience a greater burden of disability over the following 6 months 
as compared with those who did not visit the ED, but a lower burden of disability as 
compared with those who were hospitalized. Admission to a nursing home and mortality 
were evaluated as secondary outcomes.
METHODS
Study Design and Setting
This study is part of the Yale Precipitating Events Project, an ongoing prospective, 
longitudinal study of 754 initially non-disabled, community-living persons aged 70 years or 
older. The study was designed to elucidate the epidemiology of disability, with the goal of 
informing the development of effective interventions to maintain and restore independent 
function. Methods of this longitudinal study have been described in detail elsewhere.8,17,18 
Briefly, the cohort was assembled between March 1998 and October 1999 from a 
computerized list of 3157 age-eligible members of a large health plan in greater New Haven. 
Eligibility was determined during a screening telephone interview and was confirmed during 
an in-home assessment. 75.2% of the eligible members agreed to participate in the project,

 and persons who declined to participate did not significantly differ in age or sex from those 
who were enrolled. The Yale Human Investigation Committee approved the study protocol, 
and all participants provided informed consent.
Data Collection and Processing
From 1998 to 2012, participants completed comprehensive, home-based assessments at 18-
month intervals and were interviewed monthly by telephone to reassess their functional 
status, ascertain intervening illnesses and injuries leading to ED visits and hospitalizations, 
and identify nursing home admissions and deaths. For participants with significant cognitive 
impairment, a proxy informant was interviewed using a rigorous protocol with demonstrated 
reliability and validity, as described elsewhere.19 During the comprehensive assessments, 
data were collected on demographic characteristics, chronic conditions, body mass index, 
cognitive impairment, depressive symptoms, and physical frailty.
Definition of Variables
Age was measured in years at the time of the index ED visit. Nine self-reported, physician-
diagnosed chronic conditions were assessed: hypertension, myocardial infarction, congestive 
heart failure, stroke, diabetes, fractures, arthritis, chronic lung disease, and cancer (excluding 
minor skin cancers). Cognitive impairment was defined as a score less than 24 on the 
Folstein Mini-Mental State Examination.20 Depressive symptoms were defined as a score 
greater than or equal to 20 on the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale.21 
Body mass index (BMI) was assessed as self-reported weight in kilograms divided by height 
in meters squared.22 Physical frailty was defined on the basis of slow gait speed, as 
previously described.23
Assessment of Disability
Complete details regarding the assessment of disability are provided elsewhere.17–19,24 
Briefly, during the monthly interviews, participants were asked, “At the present time, do you 
need help from another person to (complete the task)?” for each of the 4 basic activities 
(bathing, dressing, walking across a room, and transferring from a chair), 5 instrumental 
activities (shopping, housework, meal preparation, taking medications, and managing 
finances), and 3 mobility activities (walk 1/4 mile, climb flight of stairs, and lift/carry 10 
pounds). For each of these 12 activities, disability was defined as the need for personal 
assistance or being unable to perform the activity. Participants were also asked about a 
fourth mobility activity, “Have you driven a car during the past month?” Participants who 
responded “No” were deemed to have stopped driving. To maintain consistency with the 
other activities, these participants were classified as being “disabled” in driving that 
month.35 The number of disabilities overall and for each functional domain (basic, 
instrumental, mobility) were summed.
Assessment of ED visits, Hospitalizations, Nursing Home Admissions, and Deaths
The primary source of information on ED visits and hospitalizations was linked Medicare 
claims data, which were available for nearly all hospitalizations and for ED visits among 
fee-for-service participants.25 Of the ED-only observations and ED-hospitalized

 observations, 605 (74.4%) and 619 (98.1%) were identified from the Medicare claims, 
respectively. For participants in managed Medicare, information on ED visits and some 
hospitalizations (i.e. those without a Medicare claim) was obtained during the monthly 
interviews. Participants were asked whether they had visited an ED or stayed at least 
overnight in a hospital since the last interview. Among a subgroup of 191 participants, we 
found that the accuracy of self-reported ED visits, compared with Medicare claims data, was 
high (κ=0.80, 95%CI, 0.78–0.82). The raw agreement was 98.4%. The accuracy of self-
reported hospitalization, based on an independent review of hospital records, was also high 
(κ=0.92, 95%CI, 0.90–0.95). The raw agreement was 98.8%.26
Participants who reported visiting the ED were asked the primary reason for their visit. 
These self-reports were complemented by Medicare claims data when needed. The list of the 
visit reasons was independently reviewed by two physicians (JMN and WF), and the reasons 
were grouped into distinct diagnostic categories using a revised version of a previously 
published protocol,27 as shown in Table 1.
Participants, or their proxies, were also asked whether they had been admitted to a nursing 
home during the past month. The accuracy of these reports was high when compared with 
Medicare claims data, with a sensitivity of 96% and specificity of 100%.8 Deaths were 
ascertained by review of the local obituaries and/or from a proxy during a subsequent 
telephone interview, with a completion rate of 100%.
Assembly of Analytic Sample
To test our hypotheses, we used a matched cohort design. This design reduces bias with little 
loss of precision and permits the use of generalized estimating equations (GEE), which 
accounts for the correlation of observations within each cluster of matched 
observations.28–30 We compared the course of disability over 6 months among 3 groups: 
those who had an ED visit but were not hospitalized (ED-only), a matched group who did 
not visit an ED (control), and an unmatched group who were hospitalized after an ED visit 
(ED-hospitalized). The pool of potential observations was not sufficiently large to permit 
concurrent matching for the ED-hospitalized group in addition to the control group.
Participants were included only if they had been living in the community immediately prior 
to their ED visit (or corresponding time point for the control group). To make full use of our 
longitudinal data, participants were allowed to contribute more than one qualifying ED-only 
or ED-hospitalized event, but only the first event was included from a specific 18-month 
interval, which was the time period between the comprehensive assessments. This 
combination of a participant and their event within an 18-month interval defined an 
“observation” and was our unit of analysis. Similarly, only one control observation per 
participant was permitted within a specific 18-month interval.
To assemble the control group, we used a SAS macro31 to sequentially match each ED-only 
observation with an unexposed, or control, observation on the following four features: (1) 
sex; (2) participant age (± 4 years) at the time of ED visit; (3) number of disabilities (± 1) 
out of the 13 possible in the month prior to the ED visit; and (4) number of months since the 
previous comprehensive assessment. The analytic sample included 813 observations (from 
Nagurney et al.

 430 participants) in the ED-only group, 813 observations (from 442 participants) in the 
control group, and 631 observations (from 390 participants) in the ED-hospitalized group. 
One hundred twenty-one participants had observations in both the ED-only and Control 
groups, 97 in both the ED-only and ED-hospitalized groups, and 139 in all the 3 groups.
Outcome measures
The primary outcome was the number of disabilities in the 13 basic, instrumental, and 
mobility activities during 6 months following the ED visit, hospitalization, or corresponding 
time point for the control group. Hereafter, we refer to this time-point as the index month. To 
determine whether our findings were consistent across these three functional domains, we 
also evaluated the number of disabilities in the 4 basic, 5 instrumental, and 4 mobility 
activities, respectively. While there is some debate about whether these activities should be 
considered on an ordinal or interval scale,32 we have chosen to analyze them on an interval 
scale as in prior studies.8 We chose the 6-month time period as it has previously been used 
when evaluating disability following hospitalization.33 As secondary outcomes, we 
evaluated nursing home admissions and deaths over the 6-month period following the index 
month.
Statistical analysis
The reasons for the ED visits were tabulated. Demographic and clinical characteristics were 
summarized by means with standard deviations and frequencies with proportions for the ED-
only group, the matched control group, and the unmatched ED-hospitalized group.
Because each outcome represents a count, we fit Poisson GEE models to evaluate 
associations between the two primary comparison groups (ED-only and control) and 
disability scores over the 6 months of follow-up. The GEE Poisson models were adjusted for 
the 4 matching criteria, non-white race, education< 12 years, living situation (alone versus 
with others), number of chronic conditions, body mass index, cognitive impairment 
(MMSE<24), depressive symptoms (CES-D≥20), physical frailty, and calendar year. Based 
on prior recommendations,34 the model adjusts for matching variables to address residual 
confounding and censoring. A compound symmetry covariance structure accounted for 
correlations among multiple intervals from the same participant and matching between the 
ED-only and control groups. These models yielded adjusted relative risks (RR), which 
denote the increase in disability burden over the 6-month follow-up period for the ED-only 
group relative to the control group. These analyses were repeated for comparisons between 
the ED-only and unmatched ED-hospitalized groups. All models were checked for fit using 
the Quasi-information Criterion (QIC).
For the secondary outcomes, we plotted the percentage of observations with a nursing home 
stay and the percentage of reported deaths in the 6 months following the index month. We 
then used multivariable Cox regression models to assess the independent associations 
between exposure to ED-only (versus matched control) or ED-hospitalized (versus ED-only) 
and time to nursing home admissions and death, respectively, while adjusting for the 
previously described set of covariates. The correlation among multiple intervals from the 
same participant for the nursing home outcome was accounted for as a cluster, while

 matching between the ED-only and control group was accounted for using a conditional 
model.
All analyses were performed using SAS (version 9.4), and P < 0.05 (2-tailed) was used to 
indicate statistical significance.
RESULTS
Table 1 provides the reason for ED visits for the ED-only and the ED-hospitalized groups. 
The most common reasons for an ED visit in both groups were musculoskeletal complaints, 
cardiac complaints, and “other” medical problems, such as feeling weak, tired, or unwell.
Table 2 provides the characteristics of the three groups. As expected, the ED-only and 
control groups were well matched on age, sex, number of disabilities, and number of months 
since the prior comprehensive assessment. The mean age in both groups was 83.6 years, and 
68.9% were female. The baseline disability scores were 3.4 and 3.6 in the ED-only and 
control groups, respectively.
Figure 1A shows the disability scores in all 13 activities over the 6-month follow-up period. 
Throughout the follow-up period, the ED-only group had disability scores that were higher 
than the control group but lower than the ED-hospitalized group. In the longitudinal model, 
the ED-only group had significantly higher overall disability scores than the control group, 
with an adjusted risk ratio (RR) of 1.14 (95%CI, 1.09–1.19). Compared with participants in 
the ED-only group, those who were hospitalized after an ED visit had disability scores that 
were significantly higher, with an adjusted RR of 1.17 (95%CI, 1.12–1.22). Comparable 
results were observed for each of the 3 functional domains (basic, instrumental and mobility 
activities), as shown in Figure 1B–1D and Table 3.
Figure 2A provides descriptive results on the percentage of participants living in a nursing 
home during the 6-month follow-up period according to study group. Nursing home 
utilization was highest in the ED-hospital group, intermediate in the ED-only group, and 
lowest in the control group. In the multivariable analysis, nursing home stays were more 
likely in the ED-only group than the control group (hazard ratio [HR] 3.11, 95%CI 2.05–
4.72) and in the ED-hospitalized group than the ED-only group (HR 3.57, 95%CI 2.83–
4.50). Figure 2B provides descriptive results on the percentage of participants dying during 
the 6-month follow-up period according to study group. On average, mortality was highest 
in the ED-hospitalized group, intermediate in the ED-only group, and lowest in the control 
group. In the multivariable analysis, the likelihood of dying was greater in the ED-only 
group compared to the control group (HR 1.93, 95%CI 1.07–3.49) and in the ED-
hospitalized group compared to the ED-only group (HR 3.11, 95%CI 2.05–4.72).
LIMITATIONS
Our study has important limitations. First, because the study was observational, the 
associations identified cannot be interpreted as causal. However, the frequency of our 
assessments increases the likelihood that the intervening illnesses and injuries leading to an 
ED visit were temporally related to the worsening course of disability, an important criterion

 for causality. Second, to make full use of our longitudinal data, we analyzed observations, 
rather than participants. Rigorous methods were used to match the ED-only and control 
group intervals and to reduce bias and collinearity among observations. The multiple entries 
for a single participant could be construed as posing a violation of the independence 
assumption, but rigorous statistical methods were used to account for within-participant 
correlations. Lastly, our cohort was limited to members of a single health plan in a small 
urban area, and may not be generalizable to other areas. The demographics of our cohort, 
however, were similar to those of the U.S. as a whole, with the exception of race, and the 
generalizability of our results is enhanced by the high participation rate, which was over 
75%.
DISCUSSION
In this matched cohort study of community-living older persons, we found that participants 
who presented to the ED and were discharged had a worse functional course and higher 
nursing home utilization and mortality over a 6-month period than participants who did not 
present to the ED, but they had better outcomes than those who presented to the ED and 
were hospitalized. These results were observed for all three functional domains and persisted 
despite adjustment for multiple potential confounders. Collectively, our findings provide 
strong evidence that illnesses and injuries leading to an ED visit without hospitalization have 
serious adverse consequences among community-living older persons.
Much of the previous work on functional outcomes after an acute illness or injury has 
focused on the course of disability after hospitalization, but less is known about the 
functional consequences of an illness or injury leading to an ED visit without 
hospitalization. Our findings are consistent with those of prior studies showing that older 
persons who present to an ED with traumatic injuries experience a short-term decline in 
function of 7% to 42%.10–12,14 Instead of focusing on a single presenting problem, our study 
included ED visits for a large number of reasons, the most common being musculoskeletal, 
which represented almost one third of the ED-only visits. Although beyond the scope of the 
current study, determining whether the course of disability after an ED visit differs 
according to the presenting problem should be the focus of future research.
Our findings are also consistent with studies in the U.S. and Canada, which found that 20% 
to 25% of older ED patients experience some functional decline in the 6 months after an ED 
visit.13,15 These studies, however, were limited by the absence of suitable comparison 
groups and by retrospective reports of pre-illness function. In contrast, our study included a 
matched comparison group of older persons with no ED visit and included prospective 
reports of pre-illness function. To our knowledge, the current study is the first to evaluate the 
course of disability following an ED visit in a general cohort of community-living older 
persons in the U.S.
In contrast to prior studies, the current study included nursing home utilization and mortality 
as additional outcomes. The higher rates of nursing home stays and mortality among 
participants with an ED visit but not hospitalization strengthen our primary finding of

 increased disability in the ED-only group, and support the clinical significance of the 
observed functional decline.
Additional strengths of the current study include its prospective, longitudinal design, high 
participation rate, and minimal attrition for reasons other than death; the rigorous 
ascertainment of ED visits and hospital admissions through claims data supplemented by 
self-reported information with demonstrated validity; the monthly assessments of disability 
with 13 basic, instrumental and mobility activities for more than 14 years; and adjustment 
for a comprehensive set of potential confounders, which were updated every 18 months. 
Although residual confounding is always a possibility in an observational study, participants 
in the ED-only group and control group were well matched on the most important 
prognostic characteristics, including pre-ED function.
Previous work has shown that disability results from a combination of preexisting 
vulnerability (such as frailty and cognitive impairment) and subsequent precipitating events, 
including hospitalization.4,7 The results of the current study indicate that illnesses and 
injuries leading to an ED visit without hospitalization have serious adverse consequences, 
including worsening disability and increased nursing home utilization and death. These 
results provide strong evidence that an ED visit often acts as precipitating event of disability, 
and they suggest that the period after an ED visit represents a vulnerable time for 
community-living older persons. Our findings should spur ongoing efforts 35–38 to provide 
functional assessments and appropriate interventions for older patients who present to the 
ED, and they support the need for further research to evaluate new models of care for this 
population.

aValues denote the relative increase in disability burden over the 6-month follow-up period for the two comparison groups. For each of these 13 
activities, disability was defined as the need for personal assistance or unable to do. The number of disabilities overall and for each group of 
activities (basic, instrumental, mobility) were summed. Abbreviations: RR, relative risk; CI, confidence interval.
bADLs (activities of daily living) included bathing, dressing, walking across a room, and transferring from a chair.
cIADLs (instrumental activities of daily living) included shopping, housework, meal preparation, taking medications, and managing finances.
dMobility activities included walking 0.40 km, climbing one flight of stairs, lifting and carrying 4.5 kg, and driving a car in the past month.
