IMPORTANCE Despite lack of evidence of their utility, biomarkers of ovarian reserve are being
promoted as potential markers of reproductive potential.
OBJECTIVE To determine the associations between biomarkers of ovarian reserve and
reproductive potential among women of late reproductive age.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Prospective time-to-pregnancy cohort study (2008 to
date of last follow-up in March 2016) of women (N = 981) aged 30 to 44 years without a
history of infertility who had been trying to conceive for 3 months or less, recruited from the
community in the Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina, area.
EXPOSURES Early-follicular-phase serum level of antimüllerian hormone (AMH),
follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and inhibin B and urinary level of FSH.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcomes were the cumulative probability of
conception by 6 and 12 cycles of attempt and relative fecundability (probability of conception
in a given menstrual cycle). Conception was defined as a positive pregnancy test result.
RESULTS A total of 750 women (mean age, 33.3 [SD, 3.2] years; 77% white; 36% overweight
or obese) provided a blood and urine sample and were included in the analysis. After
adjusting for age, body mass index, race, current smoking status, and recent hormonal
contraceptive use, women with low AMH values (<0.7 ng/mL [n = 84]) did not have a
significantly different predicted probability of conceiving by 6 cycles of attempt (65%; 95%
CI, 50%-75%) compared with women (n = 579) with normal values (62%; 95% CI, 57%-66%)
or by 12 cycles of attempt (84% [95% CI, 70%-91%] vs 75% [95% CI, 70%-79%],
respectively). Women with high serum FSH values (>10 mIU/mL [n = 83]) did not have a
significantly different predicted probability of conceiving after 6 cycles of attempt (63%;
95% CI, 50%-73%) compared with women (n = 654) with normal values (62%; 95% CI,
57%-66%) or after 12 cycles of attempt (82% [95% CI, 70%-89%] vs 75% [95% CI,
70%-78%], respectively). Women with high urinary FSH values (>11.5 mIU/mg creatinine
[n = 69]) did not have a significantly different predicted probability of conceiving after 6
cycles of attempt (61%; 95% CI, 46%-74%) compared with women (n = 660) with normal
values (62%; 95% CI, 58%-66%) or after 12 cycles of attempt (70% [95% CI, 54%-80%] vs
76% [95% CI, 72%-80%], respectively). Inhibin B levels (n = 737) were not associated with
the probability of conceiving in a given cycle (hazard ratio per 1-pg/mL increase, 0.999; 95%
CI, 0.997-1.001).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among women aged 30 to 44 years without a history of
infertility who had been trying to conceive for 3 months or less, biomarkers indicating
diminished ovarian reserve compared with normal ovarian reserve were not associated with
reduced fertility. These findings do not support the use of urinary or blood follicle-stimulating
hormone tests or antimüllerian hormone levels to assess natural fertility for women with
these characteristics.

 W
omen are delaying their attempts to conceive until
older ages.1 As a woman ages, her oocyte and fol-
licular pool declines.2 As the oocyte and follicular
pool declines, granulosa cells secrete less inhibin B and anti-
müllerian hormone (AMH).3,4 Lower inhibin B levels lead to
an earlier and more rapid increase in follicle-stimulating hor-
mone (FSH) during the follicular phase.5 Collectively, AMH,
early-follicular-phase FSH, and inhibin B have been referred
to as biomarkers of ovarian reserve.
The ability of these biomarkers to predict reproductive po-
tential is uncertain. Antimüllerian hormone has been associ-
ated with time to menopause in a number of cohorts.6,7 Among
women with infertility undergoing controlled ovarian hyper-
stimulation for in vitro fertilization, AMH is an excellent pre-
dictor of oocyte yield.8 Studies on the ability of these biomark-
ers to predict which women will conceive with in vitro
fertilization have had inconsistent findings.9-11 Despite lack of
evidenceoftheirutility,biomarkersofovarianreservearebeing
used as markers of reproductive potential or fertility tests.
Home fertility tests based on day 3 urinary FSH levels are com-
mercially available. Additionally, clinicians use these tests
when counseling about elective oocyte cryopreservation.
The objective of this study was to determine the extent to
which biomarkers of ovarian reserve (early-follicular-phase se-
rum AMH, serum FSH, serum inhibin B, and urinary FSH) were
associated with reproductive potential, as measured by the
probability of conceiving naturally, in a cohort of women of
older reproductive age recruited from the community. It was
hypothesized that women with biomarker values suggesting
diminished ovarian reserve would have a lower probability of
conceiving in a given cycle (fecundability) by 6 cycles and by
12 cycles of trying to conceive.
Methods
The Time to Conceive study, a prospective time-to-pregnancy
cohort study, was conducted from April 2008 to March 2016
(date of last follow-up). Women were eligible to participate
if they were between 30 and 44 years of age, had been attempt-
ing to conceive for 3 months or less, and were cohabitating
with a male partner. Women were excluded if they had known
fertility problems (history of sterilization, diagnosis of poly-
cystic ovarian syndrome, previous or current use of fertility
treatments, known tubal blockage, surgically diagnosed en-
dometriosis) or a partner with a history of infertility. Women
who were currently breastfeeding or had used injectable hor-
monal contraception in the preceding year were also ex-
cluded. This study was approved by the institutional review
board of the University of North Carolina; all participants pro-
vided written informed consent.
Women were recruited through flyers in the community,
radio and print ads, informational letters, and mass emails.
They were screened for eligibility by telephone using a stan-
dardized questionnaire. Women who met eligibility criteria
completed a questionnaire including demographics and in-
formation on factors potentially related to fertility. To char-
acterize the study population, this questionnaire included a
question about race. Women self-selected their race from cat-
egories provided. Women were instructed to contact the study
coordinator with their subsequent menses. They were sched-
uled for a study visit on cycle day 2, 3, or 4 of their menstrual
cycle. Women were mailed a urine collection kit and in-
structed to collect a first-morning urine sample on the day of
their study visit. At that visit, a blood sample and urine sample
(if not collected at home) were obtained from the participant.
Women were provided with home urine pregnancy tests
(sensitivity: 20 mIU/mL human chorionic gonadotropin). For
the first 3 years of the study, women were instructed to per-
form the pregnancy test with missed menses; subsequently,
women were instructed to test starting on menstrual cycle day
28 and every 3 days thereafter.
While attempting to conceive, women completed a daily
diary in which they recorded bleeding, intercourse, medica-
tions, and results of pregnancy tests. Women completed these
diaries for up to 4 months and then subsequently completed
monthly questionnaires. Initial versions of the question-
naires were on paper and later versions were web-based.
Women were instructed to contact study personnel if they
tested positive for pregnancy. They were provided a free
pregnancy ultrasound between 6 and 8 weeks’gestation to en-
courage communication of results. Women were initially fol-
lowed up for up to 6 months, but the protocol was subse-
quently modified in March 2010 to follow up with all women
for up to 12 months of pregnancy attempt. Women were with-
drawn from the study at initiation of fertility medication, on
request(mostcommonlybecausetheyweremovingorstopped
trying to conceive), or when lost to follow-up.
Serum Analysis
Serum samples were stored at −30°C until analysis. Samples
were shipped frozen in a single batch to the University of
Southern California Reproductive Endocrinology Labora-
tory. There, they were assayed using sensitive and specific as-
says for FSH (Immulite analyzer, Siemens), inhibin B (enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA], Ansh Laboratories), and
AMH(ultrasensitiveAMHELISA,AnshLaboratories;lowerlimit
of detection, 0.078 ng/mL). Interassay coefficients of varia-
tion ranged from 4% to 5% for FSH, 5% to 8% for inhibin B, and
9% to 11% for AMH.
Key Points
Question Is diminished ovarian reserve, as measured by low
antimüllerian hormone (AMH), associated with infertility among
women of late reproductive age?
Findings In this time-to-pregnancy cohort study of women aged
30 to 44 years without a history of infertility, women with a low
AMH value had an 84% predicted cumulative probability of
conception by 12 cycles of pregnancy attempt compared with 75%
in women with a normal AMH value, a nonsignificant difference.
Meaning Among women attempting to conceive naturally,
diminished ovarian reserve was not associated with infertility;
women should be cautioned against using AMH levels to assess
their current fertility.

 Urine Analysis
Urine samples were stored and shipped frozen to the Na-
tional Institute for Occupational Safety and Health Reproduc-
tive Endocrinology Laboratory, Cincinnati, Ohio. There, they
were assayed for FSH and creatinine as described previously.12
To adjust for urine flow rate, urinary FSH values were di-
vided by the respective creatinine concentration. Results are
presented as milli–international units of FSH per milligram of
creatinine. Intra-assay coefficients of variation were 3.5% for
FSH and 1.5% for creatinine.
Statistical Analysis
The primary outcome measures for the study were the cumu-
lative probability of conception by 6 menstrual cycles and by
12 menstrual cycles and relative fecundability. There were no
secondary outcomes, but planned exploratory analyses
examined associations between levels of AMH and the pri-
mary outcomes among age subgroups and between parity
subgroups.
The biomarkers of ovarian reserve were considered as cat-
egorical variables where informed choices for cut points were
available. It was hypothesized that the relationship between
AMH and fertility would be nonlinear. After exploring clinical
AMH cutoff values of 0.4 ng/mL, 0.7 ng/mL, and 1.0 ng/mL,
the middle cutoff value of 0.7 ng/mL was selected based on
previous research.13 The 90th percentile was selected as the
upper-level AMH cutoff value (8.5 ng/mL). The clinical value
of 10 mIU/mL was selected a priori as the serum FSH cutoff
value.14 For urine, the corresponding FSH value is 11.5 mIU/mg
creatinine, as documented previously.13 Inhibin B was mod-
eled as a continuous variable because no clinical cutoff val-
ues were available.
Nonparametric bivariable analyses were used to com-
pare median biomarker levels by participant characteristics.
Because women did not all enter at the same point during their
attempts to conceive and some women withdrew, started fer-
tilitymedications,orwerelosttofollow-up,thecohortwasana-
lyzed using a discrete-time Cox proportional hazards model.
Time was menstrual cycles at risk of pregnancy (pregnancy at-
tempt cycle). Pregnancy attempt cycle was determined from
the time a woman started trying to conceive, not from the time
of enrollment. Attempt cycle at enrollment was defined by the
pregnancy attempt cycle (usually cycle 1, 2, or 3) in which the
woman began participation (completed diaries or baseline
questionnaire). Women were censored at the time they with-
drew, started fertility medications, or were lost to follow-up.
Thus, cycles from enrollment to censoring were included in
theanalysis.Becausetimeinthesemodelsismeasuredbymen-
strual cycles (and not chronologic time) the hazard ratios (HRs)
are referred to as fecundability ratios, which are the relative
probability of pregnancy in a given cycle for the exposed group
relative to the reference group.15 In such models an HR of less
than 1 suggests reduced fecundability in the exposed (or non-
referent) group.
TheCoxproportionalhazardmodelswerethenusedtocal-
culate the cumulative probability of conceiving (with 95% con-
fidence intervals) at 6 and 12 cycles of attempt for each bio-
marker level. All models were adjusted for age (3 categories:
<35, 35-37, or 38-44 years),16 body mass index (4 categories:
<18.5, 18.5-24.9, 25-29.9, or ≥30; calculated as weight
in kilograms divided by height in meters squared),17 race
(white or nonwhite), current smoking status (yes or no), and
hormonal contraceptive use in the preceding year (yes or no).
Adjusted Kaplan-Meier curves with 95% confidence inter-
vals were also constructed. The predicted probabilities and
Kaplan-Meier curves were calculated by setting all of the co-
variates to the mean of the cohort. Planned subgroup analy-
ses were conducted by age and parity. To test for interaction
by age and parity, a likelihood ratio test was used to compare
the fit for the model without the interaction term with that of
the model including the interaction term. In addition, post hoc
sensitivity analyses were conducted by creating additional Cox
models to assess different cutoff values and to evaluate po-
tential biases.
A sample size of 750 women was selected based on an a
priori power analysis. A 10% loss to follow-up, 70% preg-
nancy rate in the control group, 57% pregnancy rate by 6
months in the diminished ovarian reserve group, and 80%
power at a type I error rate of .05 was conservatively pre-
sumed based on the pilot study.13 SAS version 9.3 (SAS Insti-
tute Inc) and R version 3.3.0 (R Project) were used for statis-
tical analysis. All testing was 2-sided. P<.05 was considered
statistically significant; there was no adjustment for multiple
comparisons.
Results
Study flow is presented in Figure 1. Nine hundred eighty-one
women were enrolled; 770 of these women had a study visit;
750 women were ultimately included in the analysis. Of
these, 37 (5%) withdrew, 47 (6%) started fertility medica-
tions, 56 (7%) were lost to follow-up, 487 (65%) conceived,
and 123 (17%) completed the study but did not conceive. Of
the analyzed cohort, 69% of participants were aged 30 to 34
years, 19% were aged 35 to 37 years, and 12% were aged 38
years or older. Most participants were white (77%) and highly
educated (62% with a graduate degree). The majority of
women had a normal body mass index (62%), while 3% were
underweight and 36% were overweight or obese. Cox analy-
sis showed that the probability of conception was 65% by 6
cycles of attempt and 77% by 12 cycles of attempt. Fecund-
ability over each attempt cycle is presented in Table 1.
The distributional statistics for the observed biomarkers
of ovarian reserve are as follows. Serum AMH, inhibin B, and
FSH values were missing for 13 study participants (2%), who
were excluded from AMH, inhibin B, and FSH analyses
accordingly. Urinary FSH values were missing for 21 partici-
pants (3%), who were excluded from the analyses of urinary
FSH. Each participant had at least 1 biomarker value
recorded. Eleven percent of women had an AMH value of 0.7
ng/mL or less; by design, 10% had an AMH value of 8.5
ng/mL or higher. Eleven percent had a serum FSH value of 10
mIU/mL or higher; 9% had a urine creatinine-corrected FSH
value of 11.5 mIU/mg creatinine or higher. The median value
for inhibin B was 70 (interquartile range, 38-102) pg/mL.

 Table 2 presents the unadjusted median values of each
biomarker (with interquartile ranges) by participant charac-
teristics. As expected, AMH levels decreased and urinary FSH
values increased with age. Compared with nonobese women,
obese women had lower AMH (P = .007) and inhibin B
(P = .005) values. Biomarker values did not significantly dif-
fer by education level, race, smoking status, hormonal con-
traceptive use in the preceding year, or cycle of pregnancy
attempt in which the study participant was enrolled. Women
who had previously been pregnant had significantly lower
AMH values and higher urinary FSH values in this unad-
justed analysis.
Antimüllerian hormone values were not statistically dif-
ferent across years of sample collection (Kruksal-Wallis test:
P = .83),suggestingthatAMHlevelsasmeasuredusingtheAnsh
assay are stable over prolonged storage at −30°C. A subset of
samples (n = 99) were analyzed for AMH using the Diagnostic
Systems Laboratory assay, Gen II assay (Beckman Coulter), and
Ansh assay. There was high pairwise correlation between as-
say values (Pearson r = 0.96-0.97; P < .001).
Primary Outcomes
The predicted probability of conceiving by 6 cycles or 12 cycles
of attempt, as calculated from the Cox models, was not lower
for women with low AMH or high FSH, as had been hypoth-
esized (Table 3). Women with low AMH values (<0.7 ng/mL)
did not have a significantly different cumulative probability
of conceiving by 6 cycles of attempt (65%; 95% CI, 50%-75%)
comparedwithwomenwithnormalvalues(62%;95%CI,57%-
66%)orby12cyclesofattempt(84%[95%CI,70%-91%]vs75%
[95% CI, 70%-79%], respectively). Women with high serum
FSH values (>10 mIU/mL) did not have a significantly different

(63%; 95% CI, 50%-73%) compared with women with normal
values (62%; 95% CI, 57%-66%) or after 12 cycles of attempt

Meier curves comparing adjusted cumulative probabilities of

sented in Figure 2. Although the curves suggest longer times
to pregnancy in women with higher AMH values and for those
with lower FSH values, confidence intervals overlap for both
biomarkers. High and normal urinary FSH value curves are al-
most indistinguishable from one another.

of conceiving in a given cycle (HR per 1-pg/mL increase, 0.999;

Secondary Analyses
Planned subgroup analyses by age and parity were con-
ducted (Table 4). In every age group, low AMH was not asso-
ciated with diminished fecundability. Point estimates sug-
gested higher fecundability among women with low AMH at
any age. The relationship between high AMH and fecundabil-
ity appeared to differ by a woman’
s age. In younger women,
high AMH suggested reduced fecundability. However, among
older women, high AMH suggested higher fecundability. Al-
though these point estimates differed, the confidence inter-
vals overlap and the age interaction was not found to be sta-
tistically significant (P = .35). Subsequent subgroup analysis

In sensitivity analyses, different cutoff values for AMH
were examined. Women with AMH values of 0.4 ng/mL or
lower had an HR of 1.40 (95% CI, 0.95-2.07) compared with
women with AMH values between 0.4 ng/mL and 5.0 ng/mL.

Discussion
In this cohort of women of older reproductive age attempting
to conceive naturally, biomarkers of diminished ovarian
reserve (low AMH or high FSH) were not associated with
reduced fecundability or a lower cumulative probability of
conceiving by 6 or 12 cycles of pregnancy attempt. Early-
follicular-phase inhibin B levels were also not associated with
fertility outcomes.
In an earlier, small pilot study (n=100 women), we found
that low AMH (≤0.7 ng/mL) as measured using the Diagnostic
Systems Laboratory assay was associated with a 60% reduc-
tion in the day-specific probability of conception.13 Those
findings are different from current findings in this larger
cohort, most likely because of sample size. Also, the pilot
study used a day-specific probability analysis. This method
uses information on intercourse patterns around the time of
ovulation that relied on a calendar method that could have
led to misclassification. Additionally, a different AMH assay
was used. There is some evidence that the Ansh assay results
in higher values compared with other assays.18 However,

 a sensitivity analyses with the higher (AMH ≤1.0 ng/mL) and
lower (AMH ≤0.4 ng/mL) cutoff values was conducted, and
there was still no evidence of reduced fecundability in either
of the low AMH groups.
Three other publications examined AMH and fecundabil-
ity in women attempting to conceive naturally and none re-
ported significant associations.19-21 In a prospective study of
186 Danish women, Hagen et al19 found that fecundability was
notsignificantlyreducedinwomenwithlowAMH(≤10pmol/L;
approximately ≤1.4 ng/mL) compared with women with nor-
mal AMH levels (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.44-1.40). The cohort in-
cluded women aged in their mid-20s and had a smaller sample
size (n = 186). A secondary analysis of the EAGER study, which
was a randomized clinical trial of aspirin for women (average
age, 28.7 [SD, 4.8] years) with a prior pregnancy loss, found
no statistically significant association between low AMH and
fecundability using the Gen II assay with a cutoff value of
1.0 ng/mL (HR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.85-1.49).20
Given that prior studies were small or based on second-
ary analyses, the finding in the current study that women with
diminished ovarian reserve did not have reduced fertility was
surprising and contrary to the hypothesis. Although both ovar-
ian reserve and fertility decline with chronological age when
looking at cross-sectional data, there may be little associa-
tion between a given woman’
s ovarian reserve and factors that
affect her fertility, such as egg quality. Antimüllerian hor-
mone and FSH levels may, however, affect follicular recruit-
ment in those with diminished ovarian reserve. It is possible
that low AMH allows for a greater proportion of the remain-
ing primordial follicle pool to activate and become growing
follicles. Additionally, high FSH seen in women with low re-
serve could lead to “superovulation” with multifollicular ovu-
lation, increasing the odds of pregnancy. It has previously been
shown that women of advanced maternal age are at higher risk
of dizygotic twins.22
It was hypothesized that younger women with dimin-
ished ovarian reserve might not have decreased fertility but
that older women would. However, the exploratory sub-
group analysis did not support this. Neither the younger (30-35
years of age) nor the older women with diminished ovarian re-
serve (as measured by AMH) showed reduced fecundability.
However, high AMH was nonsignificantly associated with re-
duced fecundability in the younger women and increased fe-
cundability in the older women. Hagen et al similarly found
that young women with high AMH levels had reduced fecund-
ability(HR,0.62;95%CI,0.39-0.99).19Antimüllerianhormone

 is not only a marker of ovarian reserve but also a potential
marker for polycystic ovarian syndrome. While the appropri-
ate AMH cutoff value for polycystic ovarian syndrome is de-
bated, multiple studies have shown that AMH is elevated in
women with polycystic ovarian syndrome.18,23 In younger
women, high AMH values may suggest undiagnosed polycys-
tic ovarian syndrome. High AMH may inhibit follicle sensitiv-
ity to FSH and subsequent follicular recruitment.24 In older
women, high AMH may simply reflect higher-than-normal
ovarianreserve.FurtherstudyofwomenwithhighAMHacross
various age groups and over time is warranted.
This study has several strengths. First, it was specifically
designed to address an important public health question:
Is diminished ovarian reserve a cause of infertility in women
of late reproductive age? Second, the sample size is large
enough to detect even relatively small effects. Third, its pro-
spective design allows for biomarker testing at the appropri-
ate time and inclusion of participants with the full range of
natural fertility. Fourth, most women were enrolled during
their first 3 menstrual cycles of attempting to conceive.
Enrolling women later selects a less fertile cohort, as 50% of
women are likely to conceive within the first 3 cycles.25 Fifth,
the age range studied (30-44 years) focuses on women at risk
of diminished ovarian reserve. Sixth, the study protocol stan-
dardized the outcome measure (whether a woman conceived
in any given menstrual cycle). This was done by providing
women free pregnancy tests and instructing them on when
to test for pregnancy. Thus, the sensitivity of the test was the
same for all, and the set timing of testing minimized the
potential for differential identification of pregnancies. Sev-
enth, the ovarian reserve markers evaluated include urinary
FSH, which is used in the commercially available test kits
marketed for women to assess their natural fertility. Thus,
the findings relate directly to the usefulness of such tests.
Eighth, biomarkers were measured in all study participants
during the early follicular phase, minimizing potential varia-
tion in biomarkers due to the phase of the menstrual cycle.
This study has several limitations. First, conception, not
live birth, was the primary outcome. Fecundity, the capacity
to reproduce, is composed of the ability to both conceive and
carry a fetus to viability. Diminished ovarian reserve could
affect fecundity by increasing the risk of miscarriage, perhaps
through an effect on egg quality. Prior studies to date have
failed to show such an association.26,27 Second, not all
women remained in the study for 12 cycles of attempt. This
was anticipated given the older-reproductive-age cohort.
Current recommendations advise women older than 35 years
to obtain an infertility evaluation after 6 months of attempt.
The median attempt cycle at which women started infertility
treatment in the study was 8 cycles. For this reason, concep-
tion by 6 cycles of attempt was calculated, and Cox models,
which allow participants who initiate fertility medications to
contribute time to the analysis until they are censored for
their fertility medication use, were constructed. Third, ovula-
tion was not assessed. This information would have allowed
us to evaluate the strictest definition of fecundability (the
probability of conceiving in a given ovulatory menstrual
cycle). Fourth, male partners did not provide a semen sample
for analysis. However, there is no reason to believe that
women with diminished ovarian reserve would be more or
less likely to be partnered with a man with abnormal semen
parameters. Fifth, not all women were enrolled in their first,
second, or third cycle of attempt; however, when the less
than 10% of women who entered after their third cycle of
attempt were excluded, the findings did not differ. Sixth,
although various AMH cutoff values were explored, the
study was not powered to look at very low (≤0.1 ng/mL) AMH
values, which reflect diminished ovarian reserve more con-
sistent with the late perimenopausal transition. It is possible
that in such advanced stages, fecundability may be affected,
especially if it results in frequent anovulation.
Conclusions
Among women aged 30 to 44 years without a history of infer-
tility who had been trying to conceive for 3 months or less, bio-
markers indicating diminished ovarian reserve compared with
normal ovarian reserve were not associated with reduced fer-
tility. These findings do not support the use of urinary or blood
FSH tests or AMH levels to assess natural fertility for women
with these characteristics.
