Background: Cancer fear and fatalism are believed to be higher in ethnic minorities and may contribute to lower engagement
with cancer prevention and early detection. We explored the levels of cancer fear and fatalism in six ethnic groups in the United
Kingdom and examined the contribution of acculturation and general fatalism.
Methods: A cross-sectional survey of 720 White British, Caribbean, African, Indian, Pakistani, and Bangladeshi women (120 of
each) was conducted. Three items assessed cancer fear and two cancer fatalism. Acculturation was assessed using (self-reported)
migration status, ability to speak English, and understanding of health leaflets; general fatalism with a standard measure.
Results: Relative to White British women, African and Indian women were more fearful of cancer, Bangladeshi women less fearful,
and Pakistani and Caribbean women were similar to White British women. Cancer fatalism was higher in all the ethnic minority
groups compared with White British women. Less acculturated women were less likely to worry (ORs 0.21–0.45, all Po0.05) or feel
particularly afraid (ORs 0.11–0.31, all Po0.05) but more likely to feel uncomfortable about cancer (ORs 1.97–3.03, all Po0.05).
Lower acculturation (ORs 4.30–17.27, Po0.05) and general fatalism (OR 2.29, Po0.05) were associated with the belief that cancer is
predetermined.
Conclusions: In general, cancer fear and fatalism are more prevalent among ethnic minority than White British women and even
more so in less acculturated ethnic minorities. This may affect their participation in cancer prevention and early detection.
Cancer fear and fatalism are associated with lower uptake of cancer
screening (Straughan and Seow, 1998; Austin et al, 2002; Robb
et al, 2008; Vrinten et al, 2015) and may contribute to delayed
presentation of cancer symptoms (Robb et al, 2009; Beeken et al,
2011; Bergamo et al, 2013; Jones et al, 2014; Balasooriya-Smeekens
et al, 2015; Lyratzopoulos et al, 2015). It is therefore increasingly
recognised that fatalistic beliefs and emotional factors such as
cancer fear need to be addressed in public health campaigns to
successfully change behaviour (Niederdeppe and Levy, 2007; Robb
et al, 2009). Messages such as ‘cancer screening saves lives’, ‘finding
cancer early makes it more treatable’, and ‘your mind will be put at
rest (if you see your doctor about a symptom)’ are becoming core
components of cancer awareness campaigns, such as the ‘Be Clear
on Cancer’ campaigns in the United Kingdom (Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, 2009; Public Health England, n.d.).
Cancer fear is defined as a negative emotional reaction to the
threat of cancer (Hay et al, 2005). Cancer fatalism is the belief that
a cancer diagnosis is a matter of fate and therefore beyond the
individual’s control (Straughan and Seow, 1998) or the belief that
death is inevitable when cancer is present (Powe and Finnie, 2003),
although some measures include both (e.g., the Powe Fatalism
Index; Powe, 1995). Cancer fear and fatalism are distinct, but
associated, constructs: cancer fear refers to the affective response to
the threat of cancer, while cancer fatalism refers to cognitions
about cancer. The two are moderately correlated; more fatalistic
attitudes towards cancer tend to be associated with being more
fearful of cancer (Miles et al, 2008; Beeken et al, 2011).
Women and those with lower levels of education tend to
have higher levels of cancer fear and fatalism (Powe and Finnie,
2003; Consedine et al, 2004b; Kudadjie-Gyamfi et al, 2005;

 Vrinten et al, 2014). Associations with age are less consistent, with
higher levels of fear in those who are younger (Consedine et al,
2004b; Kudadjie-Gyamfi et al, 2005; Vrinten et al, 2014) and higher
fatalism in those who are older (Powe and Finnie, 2003). Cancer
fear and fatalism also tend to be higher in ethnic minority groups.
For example, data from a large population-based survey in the
United States showed that Latino, Black, and Asian minority
groups were more fatalistic about the preventability of cancer than
those from White non-Latino backgrounds (Ramı
´rez et al, 2013).
These differences remained significant for the Latino and Asian
groups after controlling for age, gender, and level of education. A
number of qualitative studies have suggested that higher levels of
cancer fear and fatalism may be one explanation for ethnic
inequalities in cancer screening uptake and delayed symptom
presentation (Randhawa and Owens, 2004; Thomas et al, 2005).
This suggestion also gained support from several quantitative
studies (Austin et al, 2002; Johnson et al, 2008; Bergamo et al,
2013). For example, a large population-based study in the
United Kingdom showed that those from Asian and Black
backgrounds
were
more
fearful
and
fatalistic
about
bowel
cancer than those from White ethnic backgrounds, and this
was associated with lower uptake of colorectal cancer screening
(Robb et al, 2008).
However, levels of cancer fear and fatalism are not the same
across all ethnic minority groups (Jacobson, 1999). In a large study
conducted in the United States, up to 62% of Latinos believed that
cancer was not preventable as against 33% of Asians, 29% of
Blacks, and 22% of Whites (Ramı
´rez et al, 2013). Another large
US-based study found that breast cancer worry was highest in
Haitian and Dominican women, followed by Eastern European,
English Caribbean, and African American women, whereas
European American women had the lowest levels of worry
(Consedine, 2012). A similar pattern was observed for breast
cancer fatalism in this study.
The differences in levels of cancer fear and fatalism across
ethnic
groups
suggest
that
other cultural
factors,
such
as
language spoken and migration status, may have a role in
explaining variations in these variables. For some ethnic groups,
language
barriers
may
impede
understanding
of
the
preventive purpose of cancer screening tests, which may increase
levels of cancer fear when offered one (Meana et al, 2001;
Austin, 2009). Language barriers may also have a role in
perpetuating fatalistic beliefs: 62% of Spanish-speaking Latinos
believed that cancer was not preventable, vs 40% of English-
speaking Latinos (Ramı
´rez et al, 2013). In addition, in some
cultures, the word ‘cancer’ itself is an object of fear, and it is instead
referred to as ‘the big C’ or ‘that disease’ (Taha, 2012; Jones et al,
2014). This may lead to reluctance to read public health
messages about cancer and may also perpetuate cancer fear and
fatalistic beliefs.
A fatalistic outlook on life in general may also shape fatalistic
beliefs about cancer (Straughan and Seow, 1998; Powe and Finnie,
2003). A general sense of fatalism may be more prevalent among
certain ethnic groups, for whom cycles of poverty, unemployment,
racism, and discrimination could have fostered the belief that
events in life are beyond the individual’s control (Powe and Finnie,
2003). This may lead to cancer fatalism when a lack of health-care
access subsequently leads to poor health outcomes for cancer
(Powe and Finnie, 2003). In addition, some ethnic groups are more
likely to believe that God is in control over what happens in life,
and this belief may also extend to whether or not someone will get
cancer (Koffman et al, 2008).
In the present study, we explore cancer fear and fatalism among
women from six different ethnic backgrounds living in the United
Kingdom. We also explore the role of language spoken, migration
status, and general fatalistic beliefs in explaining cancer fear and
cancer fatalism among ethnic minority women.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants. Participants were recruited via the commercial
sampling service Ethnic Focus, which uses quota sampling to
recruit participants from ethnic minority backgrounds across
England. We commissioned them to recruit 120 women aged 30–
60 years from each of the following ethnic backgrounds: Indian,
Pakistani, Bangladeshi, African, Caribbean, and White British, for
a total sample size of 720 women. Data for the present study come
from a wider study on attitudes to cancer and cervical cancer
screening (Marlow et al, 2015), a cancer screening programme
which is implemented in the United Kingdom via GP practices.
However, Chaturvedi and McKeigue (1994) argue that recruitment
of ethnic minority samples into epidemiological studies via GP
practices may be problematic because of higher proportions of
people not registered with GP practices or contact details registered
with GPs not being up-to-date, especially in inner city areas, where
large proportions of those from ethnic minority backgrounds tend
to live. We therefore opted for a commercial sampling service with
extensive
experience
in
recruiting
respondents
from
ethnic
minority backgrounds to make sure that recruitment into the
study was not dependent on being registered with a GP and the GP
contact details of potential participants being up-to-date and to
reduce language and literacy barriers, which could have influenced
recruitment rates.
Sampling. Data were collected across 35 sampling points (post-
code sectors), which were randomly selected from a larger list
maintained by Ethnic Focus of 370 postcode sectors in England
with varying concentrations of ethnic minority groups according to
census data. Sampling points were inspected for representation of
high (10 þ %), medium (7–9%), and low (5–7%) concentrations of
ethnic minority residents, and properties within each sampling
point were visited by a multi-lingual interviewer to determine
whether eligible adults lived in the household based on age, gender,
and ethnicity. Three call back visits to interview an eligible
participant were made at a different time of day and week to the
original call before considering them as a non-responder. No
incentives were offered for study participation. The study was
considered exempt from ethics approval under the UCL Research
Ethics Committee Guidelines because participants were not
considered to constitute a vulnerable group, participation was
not deemed to cause undue stress or anxiety, and anonymous
survey and interview procedures were used.
Materials. Although data come from a wider study on cervical
cancer, all items used for the present analyses were about cancer in
general, not specifically cervical cancer. Women completed closed
questions with a multi-lingual, female interviewer. Interviewers
were competent in Gujarati, Hindi/Urdu, Syletti, French, Bangla,
Punjabi, English, and Somali.
Interview materials were extensively piloted. First, the English
language questionnaire was piloted with eight English-speaking
women from Caribbean, African, and Asian backgrounds for
comprehension of the questions. The questionnaire was then
translated into the languages most commonly spoken by the target
groups: Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Punjabi, Somali, and Urdu. After
translation, questions were checked for consistent meaning by six
bilingual researchers (Bengali, Urdu, Hindi, Punjabi, and Gujarati;
we could not find a bilingual researcher for Somali), and
interviewers were provided with an instruction sheet to clarify
any items for which the meaning could be misinterpreted.
Respondents could choose their preferred language from the seven
languages in which the questionnaire was provided.
Cancer fear. Cancer fear was assessed using three items adapted
from Berrenberg’s Cancer Attitude Inventory (Berrenberg, 1991):
BRITISH JOURNAL OF CANCER
Cancer fear and fatalism in ethnic minority women
598
www.bjcancer.com | DOI:10.1038/bjc.2016.15
 ‘Of all diseases, I am most afraid of cancer’ (greatest fear), ‘I worry
a lot about cancer’ (worry), and ‘It makes me uncomfortable to
think about cancer’ (discomfort). In a previous study (Vrinten
et al, 2014), participants from ethnic minority backgrounds were
more likely to endorse all three items than White British
participants, but differences by ethnicity could not be explored
further owing to the small number of ethnic minorities in that
sample. Inter-item correlations in this study were moderate
(ranging from 0.35 to 0.42), suggesting that the items tap different
aspects of cancer fear (Vrinten et al, 2014). They were therefore
analysed separately. All three items were measured on a 5-point
Likert scale and dichotomised into ‘No’ (0: ‘strongly disagree’,
‘disagree’, and ‘not sure’) vs ‘Yes’ (1: ‘agree’ and ‘strongly agree’).
Cancer fatalism. Cancer fatalism was measured using two items
from the Powe Fatalism Inventory (Powe, 1995). One item assessed
the belief that cancer is predetermined: ‘If someone is meant to get
cancer, they will get it no matter what they do’ (predetermination).
The second item assessed the belief that cancer is incurable: ‘If
someone has cancer, it is already too late to get treated’
(incurability). The inter-item correlation for the entire sample
was significant but small (r ¼ 0.19, Po0.001), indicating that these
items tap into different components of cancer fatalism, and they
were therefore analysed separately. Responses were made on a
5-point scale (0 ‘strongly disagree’ to 4 ‘strongly agree’) and were
dichotomised into ‘No’ vs ‘Yes’, analogous to the cancer fear items.
Ethnicity, language, migration status, and literacy. Ethnicity was
self-reported and assessed using a question from the 2011 census
with 18 options (Office for National Statistics, 2011), but women
were only included if they selected one of the six preset quotas.
Migration status and ability to speak English were assessed using
questions from the Office for National Statistics (2011) Census
household questionnaire for England. Migration status was
computed using date of birth, country of birth, and date of most
recent arrival to live in the United Kingdom. We assessed health
literacy using the question ‘How easy do you find it to understand
leaflets and letters about your health?’ (response options: ‘very
easy’, ‘fairly easy’, fairly difficult’, ‘very difficult’) adapted from the
European Health Literacy Project (HLS-EU Consortium, 2012).
General fatalism. General fatalism refers to the belief that events
in life are determined by fate and this was assessed with a four-item
measure (Jacobson, 1999), used in previous cancer-related studies
(Lyratzopoulos et al, 2015). These questions were completed at the
beginning of the survey before any cancer-specific questions were
asked. Responses were made on a 5-point scale (0 ‘strongly
disagree’ to 4 ‘strongly agree’) and a sum score was calculated
(potential range: 0–16). Scale reliability in this sample was
acceptable (Cronbach’s alpha 0.61). Because of heterogeneity of
variances between the ethnic groups and for ease of interpretation,
fatalism scores were dichotomised according to the median of the
overall sample (scores X9 indicated high fatalism, scores o9
indicated low fatalism).
Sociodemographic factors. Data on age, educational qualifications,
and marital status were assessed using 2011 census questions
(Office for National Statistics, 2011). Age was categorised into
three groups: ‘30–40’, ‘41–50’, and ‘51–60’. Educational level was
categorised into ‘no formal qualifications’, ‘some education’,
‘degree level education’, and ‘other’. Marital status was dichot-
omised into ‘married or cohabiting’ vs ‘not married’ (i.e., single/
widowed/divorced).
Analysis. Chi-square tests were used to explore differences in
cancer fear and fatalism across all six ethnic groups using
dichotomised variables and between the White British group and
each of the ethnic groups separately. Focussing on Black, Asian,
and Minority Ethnic (BAME) women only, we used logistic
regression analyses to explore the role of ethnicity, migration
status, ability to speak English, health literacy, and general fatalism
on cancer fear and fatalism. Analyses were adjusted for socio-
demographic differences (age, education, marital status, and
ethnicity). We also conducted a sensitivity analysis by excluding
all those who responded ‘not sure’ to the cancer fear and cancer
fatalism items and comparing those who disagreed and strongly
disagreed with those who agreed and strongly agreed to these
items. All analyses were carried out using SPSS 22.0 (IBM Corp.,
Armonk, NY, USA) and an alpha level of Po0.05 to indicate
significance.
RESULTS
Sample characteristics. In total, 1116 women were approached to
obtain 720 completed surveys (response rate 64.5%). Of these, 52
women (7.2%) were excluded from the analyses because of a self-
reported diagnosis of cancer (13 White British, 9 Caribbean, 6
African, 8 Indian, 8 Pakistani, 8 Bangladeshi). This left a sample of
668 women, of whom 561 (84.0%) were of non-White British
ethnicity. Demographic characteristics of the sample are presented
in Table 1. There were differences between ethnic groups in the
level of education and marital status, reflecting differences in the
population as a whole.
All of the White British women and about half of the Caribbean
women were born in the United Kingdom with a further 43% of
Caribbean women migrating to the United Kingdom as a child. For
the other ethnic groups, about half to two-thirds had migrated to
the United Kingdom as an adult. All of the White British and
Caribbean women and most of the African women (64%) had
English as their main language, compared with one-third of Indian
and Pakistani women (35% and 34%, respectively), and a quarter
of Bangladeshi women (26%). Again, these percentages reflect the
census data for this age range. All Caribbean (100%) and nearly all
White British women (93%) found it easy to understand letters and
leaflets about health, vs two-thirds of African (68%), and less than
half of Indian, Pakistani, and Bangladeshi women (45, 44, and 28%,
respectively). There were large ethnic differences in general
fatalism: few White British (11%), Caribbean (17%), or African
women (27%) scored high on general fatalism, but most Indian
(76%), Pakistani (81%), and Bangladeshi women (82%) did.
Ethnic differences in cancer fear and cancer fatalism. Inter-item
correlations for cancer fear and cancer fatalism are shown in
Table 2. There was a strong, positive correlation between having
cancer as the greatest health fear and cancer worry (r ¼ 0.61).
Other items were not at all, or only weakly, correlated (Pearson’s r
0.01–0.23).
Univariate analyses showed that there were ethnic differences in
cancer fear as indexed by having cancer as the greatest health fear
(Po0.05) and worrying about cancer (Po0.001), with more
Indian women having cancer as the greatest health fear than White
British women and African women being more worried about
cancer than White women (see Table 3). There were no ethnic
differences in discomfort when thinking about cancer (P ¼ 0.14).
Bangladeshi women were least likely to fear cancer more than
other diseases (15%), followed by White British and Caribbean
(19% and 22%, respectively), African and Pakistani (25% and 27%,
respectively), and Indian women (34%). A similar pattern was
observed for cancer worry: percentages of worry were lowest in the
Bangladeshi, Caribbean, and White British groups (9, 14, and 16%,
respectively), and highest in Indian and African women (21% and
33%, respectively).

 BAME women were more fatalistic about cancer than White
British women. Very few White British women (6%) believed that a
diagnosis of cancer was predetermined, vs 11% of African women,
23% of Caribbean women, and at least half of Indian, Pakistani,
and Bangladeshi women (50, 52, and 63%, respectively; Po0.001).
Furthermore, White British women did not believe that cancer is
incurable, but a quarter to a third of all BAME women held this
belief (Po0.001; see Table 3).
Predictors of cancer fear. We examined associations between
migration status, ability to speak English, health literacy and
general fatalism, and cancer fear and cancer fatalism in BAME
women (n ¼ 561), using the Caribbean group as the reference
category because they were most similar to White British women.
The results of the unadjusted and adjusted analyses were very
similar, so only the adjusted analyses are presented in Table 4.
After adjusting for age, education, and marital status, Indian
women were more likely to fear cancer more than other diseases
compared with Caribbean women (34% vs 22%), African women
were more worried about cancer (33% vs 14%), and Bangladeshi
women were less likely to feel uncomfortable at the thought of
cancer (18% vs 23%), with no significant differences for the other
groups compared with the Caribbean group.
When also adjusting for these ethnic differences, those who had
migrated to the United Kingdom as an adult were less likely to
have cancer as their greatest health fear (15%, vs 37% of those born
in the United Kingdom), with similar findings for those whose
main language was not English (14–21% vs 32%) and who found
letters and leaflets about health difficult to understand (6–22% vs
33%). The same pattern was found for worrying about cancer a lot
(migration: 15% vs 24%; English as a main language: 10–20% vs
25%; understanding health leaflets: 6–22% vs 24%). However, we
found the opposite effect for feeling uncomfortable when thinking
about cancer: those who were not born in the United Kingdom
(30% vs 15%), who did not speak English as their main language
(31–38% vs 19%), and who had some difficulty understanding
health
leaflets
(35–41%
vs
18%)
were
more
likely
to
be
uncomfortable about cancer. General fatalism marginally decreased

 feeling particularly fearful of cancer vs other diseases (21% vs 29%)
but was not associated with the other two cancer fear measures.
Predictors of cancer fatalism. Adjusting for differences in age,
education, and marital status, African women were less likely to
believe that a diagnosis of cancer is predetermined compared with
Caribbean women (11% vs 23%; see Table 4), while Pakistani and
Bangladeshi women were more likely to hold this belief (52% and
63%, respectively). Bangladeshi women were also more likely to
believe that cancer is incurable (38% vs 26%). When also adjusting
for these ethnic differences, those who were not born in the United
Kingdom (37–56% vs 16%), whose main language was not English
(59–68% vs 16%), and who had difficulty understanding health
leaflets (43–74% vs 16%) were more likely to feel that a diagnosis of
cancer is predetermined. The belief that cancer is incurable was not
associated with any of these variables. Similarly, general fatalism
was positively associated with believing that cancer is predeter-
mined (56% vs 19%) but not with the belief that cancer is incurable.
Sensitivity analysis. Excluding those who responded ‘not sure’ did
not make much difference to the endorsement rates of the cancer
fear items by each ethnic minority group (results not shown) or for
the belief that a diagnosis of cancer is predetermined. However,
endorsement rates for the belief that it is too late to get treated if
cancer is found increased across all ethnic minority groups, likely
owing to the high numbers of women who responded ‘not sure’ to

 this item (15% of Caribbean women, 28% of African, 36% of
Indian, 41% of Pakistani, and 34% of Bangladeshi women were
excluded). After excluding ‘not sures’, endorsement rates for cancer
being incurable were 31% for Caribbean, 49% for African, 53% for
Indian, 46% for Pakistani, and 58% for Bangladeshi women.
Rerunning the logistic regression analysis on this smaller sample
did not change the direction of the associations between ethnicity
and cancer fear or the belief that a diagnosis of cancer is
predetermined. However, women from all ethnic backgrounds
were more likely than Caribbean women to believe that cancer is
incurable (African OR ¼ 2.66, 95% CI 1.38–5.15; Indian OR ¼ 2.82,
95% CI 1.35–5.87; Pakistani OR ¼ 2.18, 95% CI 1.03–4.58,
Bangladeshi OR ¼ 3.85, 95% CI 1.79–8.29; full results available
from the first author upon request).
DISCUSSION
This study suggests that cancer remains widely feared, and that
cancer fear and fatalism vary across BAME groups in the United
Kingdom. Caribbean and Pakistani women show similar levels of
cancer fear to White British women, while Bangladeshi women are
less afraid of cancer, and African and Indian women are more
afraid. Among BAME women, those who had migrated to the
United Kingdom as adults and did not speak English very well
were less likely to worry about cancer or fear it more than other
diseases, but more likely to feel uncomfortable about cancer.
Cancer fatalism was higher in all BAME women than White British
women. Beliefs about cancer predetermination were associated
with lower acculturation and a more fatalistic outlook on life in
general, but these factors were unrelated to the belief that cancer is
incurable.
The similar levels of cancer fear for Caribbean and White British
women could reflect the fact that Caribbean women are more
acculturated: most had lived in the United Kingdom since
childhood and used English as their main language. Bangladeshi
women also formed an exception: they scored consistently lower
than White British women on all measures of cancer fear. Some
authors suggest that both high and low levels of fear can impede
cancer screening uptake (Andersen et al, 2003; Champion et al,
2004; Consedine et al, 2006), owing to a lack of threat (at low levels
of fear) or paralysing fear (high levels). Asian women (who in our
sample scored both the highest and the lowest on cancer fear) have
been shown to have high rates of non-attendance at cervical cancer
screening (Marlow et al, 2015). Future research should explore
whether this is due to particularly high or low levels of cancer fear
in these groups.
We found that those who were less acculturated (i.e., had
migrated to the United Kingdom as adults, did not speak English,
or found health letters and leaflets difficult to understand)
were less likely to worry about cancer or be particularly fearful of
the disease. One possible explanation for this finding comes
from qualitative studies that suggest that cancer fears in less
acculturated samples may be more reflective of the country of
origin and that other threats may be more prominent in
particular countries (Buki et al, 2004; Marlow et al, 2014).
Cancer is also sometimes seen as a ‘Western disease’ (Jackson
et al, 2000; Buki et al, 2004; Kwok, 2005), which could contribute
to lower levels of cancer worry, especially when compared
with other illnesses. Alternatively, greater exposure to cancer
awareness campaigns in the host country (i.e., the United
Kingdom) may also increase cancer worries and feelings of
susceptibility to cancer, particularly in those who are better
equipped to engage with these campaigns (i.e., the more
acculturated), raising important questions about the origins of
cancer fear.
Our findings have implications for public health, in particular
cancer awareness and early diagnosis campaigns. Remarkably, no
White British women believed that cancer was incurable, but a
significant proportion of BAME women endorsed this belief,
regardless of acculturation and general fatalism, raising questions
about the origins of this belief. One possibility is that previous
encounters with cancer influence beliefs about survivability and
that these are particularly bad in ethnic minorities. In some
cultures, cancer is considered a ‘taboo’, and services may therefore
not be accessed until a late stage in the disease when it is no longer
curable (Randhawa and Owens, 2004; Opoku, 2012; Granado et al,
2014). This idea is supported by findings that some BAME groups
have worse cancer survival for certain cancers, which is partially
attributable to an advanced stage at diagnosis (Jack et al, 2009;
National Cancer Intelligence Network, 2009). Regardless of the
origins of this belief, our findings suggest that messages about
increased cancer survival are not reaching all BAME women,
which was also reflected by the large proportion of women who
were excluded from the sensitivity analyses because they were ‘not
sure’ about whether cancer is curable (15–34%). It is likely that the

influences

engagement with cancer awareness campaigns and early detection
services. If so, it is important that these disparities are addressed.
Examining the effects of these ethnic differences in fear and
fatalism on early detection of cancer and screening uptake in
specific ethnic groups could help inform more targeted campaigns.
For example, Bangladeshi women not only had the lowest levels of
cancer fear and worry but also the highest endorsement levels for
fatalistic beliefs about cancer. Low levels of cancer worry could be
due to a perceived lack of susceptibility to cancer. In that case,
campaigns targeted at Bangladeshi women should address the
combination of low perceived susceptibility and beliefs about the
incurability and predetermination of cancer to encourage health-
protective behaviour in this group. African and Indian women,
and, to a lesser extent, Pakistani women, on the other hand,
experienced
high levels of cancer fear together with high
endorsement of fatalistic beliefs about cancer. Campaigns to
promote cancer early detection and screening in these groups may
need to focus on addressing fatalistic beliefs about cancer in
combination with reducing the high, possibly debilitating, levels of
fear associated with cancer in these groups. There are also stark
differences by acculturation, regardless of ethnicity: those who
migrated more recently, whose main language is not English, and
who have difficulty understanding health information are more
likely to believe that cancer is predetermined and to feel
uncomfortable discussing cancer. This may constitute an impor-
tant barrier towards engagement with cancer awareness and early
detection campaigns that may need to be addressed in these
groups.
This study also has implications for future research. The two
fatalistic beliefs about cancer used in this study (predetermination
and incurability) are not usually distinguished; even if a measure
includes both, such as the Powe Fatalism Index (Powe, 1995),
results are usually not reported by subscale. However, it may be
important to examine these beliefs separately, especially when
exploring their contributions to non-uptake of cancer screening, as
this may have practical consequences for the design of public
health campaigns. For example, the belief that cancer is incurable
may be much easier to address than the belief that a cancer
diagnosis is predetermined, especially if the latter belief stems from
a belief that events in life are generally predetermined.
We found a small but significant, negative correlation between
cancer worry and cancer predetermination, which could suggest
that the belief in cancer predetermination may partially protect
against cancer worry. Negative emotional states such as cancer
worry tend to be regulated (Consedine et al, 2004a), and a belief
that a diagnosis of cancer is predetermined may make worrying

 redundant. Empirical support for this notion comes from a
Japanese study that found that lung cancer patients who were
‘fatalistic’ (defined as being accepting that they had no control over
their prognosis) were less likely to suffer from significant anxiety
(Shimizu et al, 2015), again suggesting that there is a possible
emotional benefit of predetermination beliefs. However, most
studies on cancer fear and fatalism, including the current one, are
cross-sectional. Thus conclusions about the causal relationship of
fear and fatalism cannot be drawn. Longitudinal studies would be
needed to create a better understanding of the causal pathways
between cancer fear and fatalism.
Another implication for future research comes from our finding
that correlations between the cancer fear and fatalism items were
generally modest and that their associations with the acculturation
and fatalism variables varied. This supports the idea that the items
tap into different components of fear and fatalism. Previous research
has shown that the sociodemographic associations and the effects of
the three cancer fear components on colorectal cancer screening
uptake vary (Vrinten et al, 2014, 2015), and future studies should
address whether this is similar for the two fatalistic beliefs.
Our study has several limitations. It was part of a larger study that
was not designed primarily to look at cancer fear and cancer fatalism
in ethnic minority women. The sample was limited to women, and
quotas for ethnicity were used to ensure equal representation of
ethnicities across the sample; thus the sample was not representative
of the UK population or the UK ethnic minority population. Care
was taken to preserve the meaning when translating the surveys into
the languages most commonly spoken by the target groups, but there
may have been slight cultural differences in meaning between the
translations. The components of cancer fear and cancer fatalism were
measured with single items, which may have limited the reliability of
these measures. The measure for educational attainment was based
on the UK 2011 Census measure, which asks about UK qualifica-
tions. Respondents with foreign qualifications are encouraged to map
their foreign qualifications onto their equivalents within the UK
educational system, but the high proportions of Indian, Pakistani,
and Bangladeshi women reporting ‘other’ types of qualifications may
indicate that these groups found it difficult to do so. This is part of a
wider problem of accurately measuring educational attainment or
socioeconomic status in ethnic minority groups, especially women.
Future studies may want to consider including measures that do not
require mapping onto the UK educational system, such as age at
which the respondent left school. Finally, marital status was adjusted
for because previous research has shown that those who are not
married tend to be more fatalistic and fearful about cancer (Hall et al,
2008; Vrinten et al, 2014), but we did not explore whether these
associations were dependent on the ethnicity of the partner.
CONCLUSION
Cancer fear and fatalism are generally more prevalent among
BAME women than White British women and are influenced by
migration status, language spoken, and fatalistic beliefs about life in
general. Those who are less acculturated are less likely to worry
about cancer but are more likely to feel uncomfortable about
cancer and to believe that a cancer diagnosis is a matter of fate.
These beliefs may affect their engagement with cancer early
detection campaigns and participation in cancer screening.
