 Diabetes mellitus is one of the largest 
epidemics the world has faced, both in 
developed and developing nations. Diabetes 
mellitus is a syndrome currently recognized 
and classified as a group of diseases 
characterized by signs and symptoms of 
chronic hyperglycaemia. Type 2 diabetes 
mellitus (T2DM), type 1 diabetes mellitus 
(T1DM) and gestational diabetes mellitus 
are by far the most frequent forms, but 
other specific types exist that are much 
less common1. This Perspectives article 
focuses primarily on T2DM, the type mainly 
responsible for the current global epidemic 
of this disease2.
Globally, the number of people with 
T2DM has more than doubled during the 
past 20 years. The latest global estimate from 
the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) 
is that in 2015 there were 415 million people 
with diabetes mellitus and that by 2040 
the number will be 642 million3. The NCD 
Risk Factor Collaboration and the WHO 
gave a similar estimate of 422 million in 
the UN General Assembly made a political 
declaration on the prevention and control of 
NCDs7, which was followed by a call by the 
World Health Assembly to reduce avoidable 
mortality from NCDs by 25% by 2025 
(REF. 8). Although these calls were welcomed, 
the practicalities of attaining such targets are 
fraught with difficulties — including that of 
defining diabetes mellitus, its complications 
and prediabetes to enable estimation of the 
burden of T2DM and its complications both 
nationally and globally.
Historical view — definitions
Published in 1978, the late Kelly West’s 
book ‘Epidemiology of Diabetes and its 
Vascular Lesions’ (REF. 9) provided the 
impetus for increased attention to the 
epidemiology of diabetes mellitus and the 
need to define internationally accepted 
diagnostic criteria. This book foresaw the 
emergence of epidemiology as a major area 
of diabetes mellitus research — diabetes 
mellitus epidemiology was coming of 
age. West’s book brought together almost 
all the contributions (clinical and popu-
lation-based) on the subject of diabetes 
mellitus epidemiology up to that time. In 
particular, it highlighted the many gaps in 
our knowledge, particularly the difficulties 
of comparing studies.
Kelly West was prophetic in predicting 
some of the issues that are under critical 
(and sometimes not so critical) debate 
today, particularly in respect to classification 
and criteria of diabetes mellitus and its 
complications. One resounding question 
that he asked was “What is diabetes?” West 
was a great proponent of standardization of 
diagnostic criteria and he reported polling 
20 international diabetologists on their views 
of the appropriate diagnostic criteria. He 
developed some hypothetical blood glucose 
results and circulated them to the group 
40 years ago. Even these experts showed 
great disparity on the diagnoses — West 
received at least 10 different sets of criteria 
from these ‘experts’ (REF. 10)!
Important milestones in diabetes mellitus 
epidemiology were the international 
workshop convened in April 1978 by 
the US National Diabetes Data Group 
(NDDG), of the NIH, USA11, followed by 
a conference held by the Kroc Foundation 
2014 (REFS 4,5). Numerous studies continue 
to confirm large increases in prevalence 
over time2. Until a decade ago, and despite 
calls from the international diabetes 
community to address the prevention of 
diabetes mellitus as a global public health 
epidemic, many international health 
agencies and national governments had 
given fairly low priority to the increasing 
frequencies of diabetes mellitus and other 
noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). 
Funding for the prevention and control of 
NCDs (including diabetes mellitus) had 
been, and generally has remained, a low 
priority compared with that for the control 
of communicable diseases2.
Against this background, in 2006, the 
United Nations (UN) General Assembly 
unanimously passed Resolution 61/225 
(REF. 6). This resolution called for diabetes 
mellitus to be recognized as an international 
public health challenge and for each nation 
to target prevention and control of the 
emerging threat. Furthermore, in 2011,

Abstract | Diabetes mellitus is one of the most important public health challenges 
of the twenty-first century. Until the past decade, it has been seriously underrated 
as a global health threat. Major gaps exist in efforts to comprehend the burden 
nationally and globally, especially in developing nations, due to a lack of accurate 
data for monitoring and surveillance. Early attempts to obtain accurate data, 
discussed in this article, seem to have been cast aside so, at present, these needs 
remain unmet. Existing international efforts to assemble information fall far short 
of requirements. Current estimates are imprecise, only providing a rough picture, 
and probably underestimate the disease burden. The methodologies that are 
currently used, and that are discussed in this Perspectives article, are inadequate 
for providing a complete and accurate assessment of the prevalence of diabetes 
mellitus. International consensus on uniform standards and criteria for reporting 
national data on diabetes mellitus prevalence as well as for common complications 
of diabetes mellitus and mortality need to be developed.

 at the McDonald Ranch in the Santa Ynez 
Valley, near Santa Barbara, California, USA 
(FIG. 1). Proceedings of the Kroc conference 
were published in Diabetes Care in March 
1979 (REF. 12) and contain extensive debate 
on issues of classification, diagnostic criteria 
and appropriate methodology for diabetes 
mellitus epidemiological studies. Later that 
year, following these meetings, the WHO 
convened its Second Expert Committee on 
Diabetes13.
The NDDG11 and WHO 
Expert Committee13 reports made 
recommendations on the classification 
and criteria for diabetes mellitus and 
associated categories of glucose intolerance. 
In particular, they recommended 
standardization of methodologies for 
epidemiology studies in diverse populations 
to facilitate comparisons within and 
between national and ethnic populations. 
Such studies were regarded as having the 
capacity to provide direction for research 
into the possible genetic and environmental 
determinants and biochemical mechanisms 
underlying T1DM and T2DM, as well as 
being able to provide important information 
on geographic, social, cultural, behavioural 
and economic risk factors. The WHO 
recommendations13 became the first widely 
recognized international criteria for the 
classification and diagnosis of diabetes 
mellitus and the newly introduced risk 
category of impaired glucose tolerance 
classification and revised criteria. The 
fasting plasma glucose (FPG) threshold for 
diabetes mellitus diagnosis was lowered 
from 7.8 mmol/l to 7.0 mmol/l and a new 
category of abnormal glucose metabolism 
was introduced — impaired fasting 
glycaemia (IFG), which is defined as an FPG 
of 6.1–6.9 mmol/l, that is, fasting glycaemia 
above ‘normal’
, but with levels not high 
enough to be diagnostic of diabetes mellitus.
Furthermore, the ADA report (but not 
the WHO report) recommended the use of 
FPG rather than the oral glucose tolerance 
test (OGTT) as the diagnostic test of 
choice both for clinical and epidemiologic 
purposes17. This recommendation was 
based on the inconvenience and cost of the 
OGTT as a result of the 2 h time interval 
and the number of blood tests involved. 
This practical yet controversial decision 
was pivotal in initiating a situation that 
has resulted in many researchers and 
countries now using the FPG as the standard 
procedure for diagnosing diabetes mellitus.
Further confusion emerged in 2003 when 
the ADA Expert Committee recommended 
that the threshold for identification of IFG 
be lowered from 6.1 mmol/l to 5.6 mmol/l 
(REF. 18). The 2006 WHO–IDF consultation 
group rejected this proposal19 and has 
retained 6.1 mmol/l as the threshold for IFG 
to the present time. The various suggestions 
from NDDG and WHO Expert groups 
for diagnostic criteria for states of glucose 
intolerance from 1964 to 2009 are shown  
in TABLE 1.
Measuring levels of HbA1c then emerged 
as a potentially attractive means to diagnose 
diabetes mellitus and other forms of 
dysglycaemia20. This measurement reflects 
glycaemia over the previous 2–3 months, 
shows less day to day variation than 
measures of FPG or 2 h post-load plasma 
glucose (2 h PG) and can be measured at 
any time of day. Use of HbA1c levels for the 
diagnosis of diabetes mellitus was formally 
recommended by an International Expert 
Committee convened by the ADA in 2009 
(REF. 20) and endorsed by the WHO in 2011 
(REF. 21) with the criterion of HbA1c ≥6.5% 
as diagnostic of diabetes mellitus. This 
recommendation comes with the caveat that 
HbA1c can be used as a diagnostic test for 
diabetes mellitus providing that stringent 
quality assurance tests are in place. In 
addition, assays need to be standardized to 
criteria aligned to international reference 
values. An additional caveat is that the 
individuals tested do not have conditions 
that change the half-life of red blood cells, 
which could preclude its use as an accurate 
(IGT). These recommendations were soon 
adopted and were used in both clinical and 
epidemiological research. However, in the 
past 15 years, there has been a renewed 
and continuing international debate, and 
considerable confusion, regarding how best 
to define and classify diabetes mellitus and 
other categories of dysglycaemia14.
Classification and criteria
The first WHO Expert Committee 
on Diabetes Mellitus was convened in 
Geneva, Switzerland, in 1965 (REF. 15). 
The report includes one of the first 
attempts at international consensus on 
a classification of diabetes mellitus but 
its impact was minimal as interest in the 
epidemiology of diabetes mellitus was still 
in its infancy. Although a number of sets of 
nomenclature and diagnostic criteria were 
subsequently proposed for diabetes mellitus, 
no systematic uniform categorization 
existed until 1980, as discussed earlier. The 
contemporary classification of diabetes 
mellitus and other categories of glucose 
intolerance began with, and are still based 
largely on, those developed in 1979 by the 
NDDG11 and the second WHO Expert 
Committee on Diabetes Mellitus in 1980 
(REF. 13). The first major revision of the 
1980 WHO classification was published 
in 1999 (REF. 16). This report, preceded by 
an American Diabetes Association (ADA) 
report17, generated a new international

 measurement of glycaemia (for example, 
haemoglobinopathies). In 2010, an ADA 
position statement indicated that people 
with HbA1c levels of 5.7–6.4% were also 
at increased risk of developing diabetes 
mellitus and should be considered to have 
‘prediabetes’ (REF. 22). However, due to lack of 
clear evidence, no such recommendation has 
been made by the WHO.
Consequently, a range of methods and 
criteria are now used to diagnose diabetes 
mellitus: FPG ≥7.0 mmol/l; or a 75 g OGTT 
2 h PG ≥11.1 mmol/l; or HbA1c ≥6.5%23. Not 
surprisingly these different criteria do not 
identify all the same individuals as having 
diabetes mellitus and the different criteria 
result in large variations in the estimated 
prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes mellitus 
(FIG. 2). In a US population, the prevalence 
of previously undiagnosed diabetes mellitus 
was 2.5% by FPG, 4.9% by 2 h PG and 
1.6% by HbA1c, with only 1.2% meeting 
all three of the criteria23. Furthermore, the 
relative frequencies and extent of overlap 
of individuals who meet these criteria 
vary considerably from one population to 
another24.
The controversy about prediabetes
Although the criteria for diabetes mellitus 
are problematic, those for people at high risk 
of developing T2DM who are designated 
as having ‘intermediate hyperglycaemia’ by 
the WHO19 or ‘prediabetes’ by the ADA25 
are even more confusing. The WHO 
criteria for intermediate hyperglycaemia 
are 2 h post 75 g OGTT plasma glucose 
levels of 7.8–11.0 mmol/l (IGT) or FPG of 
6.1–6.9 mmol/l with 2 h PG <7.8 mmol/l 
(IFG). These levels are in accord with the 
with or without IFG, and to be ineffective in 
those with isolated IFG30. Such disparities 
in the interpretation of the condition of 
prediabetes clearly causes difficulty in 
comparing the prevalence of the condition in 
different countries and also in defining who 
might best benefit from intervention26,31,32.
Correct measuring of plasma glucose
A further major consideration in this debate 
is the actual practical measurement of FPG 
and indeed the 2 h PG. A considerable 
number of individuals will not actually fast, 
and for the 2 h glucose test it is critical that 
people have an adequate carbohydrate intake 
on the day before the OGTT16. In addition, 
globally, variable attention is paid to both 
quality assurance and to sample handling. 
It is very unlikely that appropriate quality 
assurance measures have been applied to 
all the field studies of diabetes mellitus 
prevalence or that samples have been rapidly 
assayed or the blood separated quickly 
enough to prevent some loss of glucose in 
the sample16. These factors should be taken 
into account when estimating the prevalence 
of dysglycaemia in any population.
The need for reliable estimates
Reliable data on the burden posed by major 
types of diabetes mellitus are needed for 
many reasons beyond just raising and 
maintaining awareness of diabetes mellitus33. 
These include meeting national and local 
needs for planning purposes to identify 
current and future health-care priorities, to 
estimate direct and indirect economic and 
societal costs of the disease and to allocate 
appropriate health-care resources and 
expenditures for health-care delivery. These 
1997 ADA criteria17, but in 2003 the ADA 
lowered the threshold of FPG for IFG to 
5.6 mmol/l, increasing the prevalence of IFG 
twofold to threefold26,27 (FIG. 3). The incidence 
of diabetes mellitus in people with FPG 
levels of 5.6–6.0 mmol/l is much lower than 
in people with FPG levels of 6.1–7.0 mmol/l, 
who have an incidence of diabetes mellitus 
that is similar to that seen in people 
with IGT28.
After HbA1c was accepted as a basis for 
diagnosing diabetes mellitus, the ADA then 
indicated that people with levels of HbA1c 
≥5.7–6.5% should also be considered as a 
high risk category (prediabetes)25. The WHO 
guidelines committee, despite accepting 
HbA1c for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, 
rejected this proposal and retained the 
FPG and 2 h PG as the only criteria for 
intermediate hyperglycaemia.
By the ADA definition, if one or more of 
HbA1c, FPG or 2 h PG are measured, there are 
18 possible combinations of criteria that can 
designate people as having prediabetes! These 
criteria identify much larger numbers of 
people as having prediabetes than the WHO 
criteria for intermediate hyperglycaemia, 
where there are only three possible 
combinations: IFG; IGT; or IGT and IFG19. 
The extent to which these many combinations 
overlap is unclear, but emerging evidence now 
suggests that the aetiology of hyperglycaemia 
in people with only IFG (that is, isolated IFG) 
differs from that in people with IGT29,30. These 
findings might have profound implications 
on the optimal ways to prevent progression to 
diabetes mellitus in people with isolated IFG. 
Up to the present time, prevention of diabetes 
mellitus by lifestyle intervention has only 
been shown to be effective in people with IGT

 data are also very important for identifying 
groups or populations that might have 
unique or special needs related to diabetes 
mellitus, and to help define and set research 
priorities. Ongoing reliable data are also 
needed not only to project future trends, 
but to monitor the effects of treatment and 
to determine the needs, plans, design and 
effectiveness of prevention activities.
Incidence and prevalence
Traditionally, the incidence of T1DM 
in children and adolescents has been 
determined on the basis of registries of newly 
diagnosed patients with insulin-treated 
diabetes mellitus within defined populations, 
which assumes that almost all cases represent 
T1DM and that few cases escape early 
detection34,35. However, during the past 
30 years, it has become apparent that the 
majority of patients with diabetes mellitus 
have the T2DM form1,16. Furthermore, 
monogenic forms of diabetes mellitus 
such as maturity-onset diabetes in the 
young, although fairly uncommon, are 
also increasingly being recognized1,19. In 
addition to the emergence of T2DM in this 
age group, an unexplained but increasing 
incidence of T1DM has also been observed 
during the past 25 years34–36. This changing 
landscape now requires new and improved 
approaches to documenting the occurrence 
and types of diabetes mellitus in childhood 
and adolescence, such as that developed 
in the USA for the SEARCH study. This 
presently limited to a few affluent nations, 
but could become more widespread in future 
with the development of electronic medical 
record systems.
Integrity of the global estimates
As we are now faced with a global epidemic 
of T2DM and evidence of substantial 
secular increases in many nations2, as well 
as the need for accurate monitoring and 
surveillance, the expectation might be that the 
majority of prevalence studies would follow a 
standardized protocol to ensure comparability. 
Given the variations in diagnostic methods 
and criteria that are currently used around 
the world, this expectation and requirement is 
clearly not being met4.
In 1995, McCarty and Zimmet made 
the first attempt to estimate the global 
and regional burden of both T1DM and 
T2DM41. They estimated that in 1994, 
110 million people had diabetes mellitus 
and that by 2010 the number would be 
almost 240 million. This was clearly an 
underestimate given the subsequent 
predictions3,42,43. Following this initiative, 
the WHO and the IDF have produced 
estimates on the growth of diabetes mellitus 
worldwide, starting in 1998. For example, 
in 1998, it was estimated that there were 
135 million people with diabetes mellitus 
in 1995 and it was predicted that there 
would be 300 million by 2025 (REF. 42). A 
subsequent estimate proposed that there 
were 171 million people with diabetes 
mellitus in 2000 and predicted that this 
figure would rise to 366 million by 2030 
(REF. 43), a number that had already been 
surpassed in 2013 (REF. 44).
Quite apart from the lack of 
standardization of many studies, another 
major problem in obtaining an accurate 
picture of the global burden of diabetes 
mellitus is that very few developing nations 
have national data. In fact, Makaroff and 
Cavan reported in 2015 that ‘high quality’ 
prevalence surveys of diabetes mellitus 
are available for only 57% of 221 countries 
and territories and only 19% of countries 
have OGTT-based prevalence data45. Many 
middle and low income nations lack the 
resources to undertake large surveys. As 
a result, the estimates of diabetes mellitus 
prevalence are obviously nothing more 
than rough guesses! Despite this limitation, 
global estimates are now provided in the 
IDF Diabetes Atlas every 2 years3. Some will 
agree that updating the Atlas so frequently 
serves a useful purpose and keeps diabetes 
mellitus ‘on the radar’ as an important health 
issue for governments, maintaining pressure 
study requires ongoing ascertainment and 
careful characterization of cases in sentinel 
communities to determine incidence37,38.
In adults, the frequency of diabetes 
mellitus is usually quantified from prevalence 
studies as the disease is common enough to 
justify contacting and testing all members, 
or a representative sample, of the target 
population. Although previously diagnosed 
diabetes mellitus can be ascertained by 
interview or questionnaire, previously 
undiagnosed diabetes mellitus, which 
usually constitutes a sizeable proportion of 
those affected, is identified by performing 
diagnostic testing on those not already 
known to have the disorder. A diagnosis is 
made by measuring plasma levels of glucose 
either while fasting and/or 2 h after a 75 g oral 
glucose load, with levels of HbA1c being used 
in some of the latest studies20,21. Generally, 
the majority of newly recognized cases are 
assumed to have T2DM.
The incidence of T2DM is rarely 
determined as this requires repeated tests in 
the same individuals over a defined period 
of time to ascertain the proportion of the 
population with newly developed diabetes 
mellitus. Such studies are usually conducted 
primarily for research to identify risk and 
causative factors. However, the incidence of 
clinically diagnosed T1DM or T2DM can 
be determined over time in communities 
or countries39,40 with ongoing registries of 
diabetes mellitus linked to demographic 
data. Such studies are infrequent and are

 on them to address the epidemic. However, 
given the paucity of valid new data, whether 
the biannual IDF Diabetes Atlas updates 
serve the needs of epidemiology and public 
health in providing appropriate and timely 
information on the real burden for future 
planning is open to vigorous debate. In 
addition, an unfortunate outcome is that 
these global and national estimates are used 
without question by both the media and the 
scientific community.
To derive estimates for the many 
countries without national data, the IDF 
relies on extrapolating data from other 
nations with similar features (such as 
demography and ethnicity), which is a 
very fragile methodology3. Some examples 
of countries used in estimates from the 
past few years are shown in BOX 1 and 
some of these extrapolations can clearly be 
challenged as being inappropriate on ethnic 
and socio-economic grounds. For example, 
the use of South Africa as a comparator for 
Malawi, one of the poorest nations in Africa, 
is deemed to be inappropriate and Korea and 
Japan for Brunei Darussalam, equally so.
The WHO developed the STEPS 
programme in an attempt to address the 
problem of obtaining more accurate data46. 
This programme aims to provide rough 
estimates of the NCD load in a given nation. 
This strategy has its own notable limitations 
with lack of standardization of methodology 
and the diagnostic criterion for diabetes 
mellitus even within, and certainly 
between, countries. In addition, the STEPS 
programme has used FPG for the diagnosis 
mortality from NCDs, and diabetes 
mellitus in particular, we need to measure 
mortality related to diabetes mellitus in an 
appropriate way.
Assessing mortality related to diabetes 
mellitus presents particular challenges. It 
cannot be accurately assessed from death 
certificates as deaths in patients with 
diabetes mellitus usually result from one 
of its complications (such as heart disease, 
stroke or renal failure), which are listed 
as the cause of death48. Furthermore, the 
cause of death often does not mention 
diabetes mellitus as either an underlying or 
contributory cause48.
An optimal way to assess the number 
of deaths attributable to known diabetes 
mellitus is from ongoing registries of 
prevalent and new cases that can be linked 
to death registration data. However, such 
data are available in only a few developed 
countries, such as Denmark39 and Sweden49. 
An alternative method is to apply the age 
and sex-specific relative risks of death in 
people with and without diabetes mellitus 
to diabetes mellitus prevalence data50. This 
method is used to calculate mortality related 
to diabetes mellitus in the IDF Diabetes 
Atlas3. The accuracy of this method depends 
on having sound diabetes mellitus prevalence 
data and reliable estimates of the relative risks 
of death in those with and without diabetes 
mellitus. The relative risks can be calculated 
from population-based longitudinal 
cohort studies such as DECODE51, Da 
Qing52 and AusDiab53 or from death rates 
in representative cohorts of patients with 
diabetes mellitus compared with those in the 
general population, such as the South Tees 
study54 and a Taiwanese national study40. 
However, most published studies of relative 
risk are from developed countries. Relative 
risks in developing countries might be 
different from those in developed countries, 
being higher because of poorer medical care, 
or lower because of high rates of competing 
causes of death55–57. Nevertheless, when 
appropriately applied, such calculations 
provide reasonable approximations of excess 
deaths attributable to diabetes mellitus, but 
with potentially large uncertainty intervals.
Excess mortality
On the basis of death certificates, the 
GBDC reported the number of deaths 
worldwide due to diabetes mellitus in 
2013 as 1.3 million, with an additional 
173,000 deaths from chronic kidney 
disease due to diabetes mellitus, giving a 
total of 1.47 million47. Similarly, the NCD 
Risk Factor Collaboration4 and the WHO5 
of diabetes mellitus, which both grossly 
underestimates the prevalence of this disease 
and introduces methodological differences 
that make comparisons between national 
studies fraught with difficulty.
It is important to realise that the IDF3, the 
WHO5, the NCD Risk Factor Collaboration4 
and the Global Burden of Disease 
Collaboration (GBDC)47 initiatives all have 
serious limitations from an epidemiological 
standpoint. These limitations mean that only 
very broad conclusions can be drawn from 
these attempts to estimate the prevalence 
of diabetes mellitus and its outcomes. The 
estimates should not be taken as ‘gospel’ 
truth and used without the relevant 
qualifications in citations in publications by 
other researchers. Certainly, definitive action 
is needed to develop improved processes for 
obtaining accurate data that reflect the true 
situation.
Methodology for mortality data
Although prevalence data are important 
they provide only an immediate and limited 
view, or snapshot, of the magnitude and 
importance of diabetes mellitus as a global 
public health problem. The prevalence 
might rise and fall as a result of increasing 
incidence or decreasing mortality, and vice 
versa. Mortality data are important as they 
provide information not only on the number 
of deaths attributable to a disease, but for 
calculation of life expectancy, lifetime risk 
and numbers of years of life lost due to the 
disease. To address the call by the World 
Health Assembly8 to reduce avoidable

 reported that 1.5 million deaths were caused 
by diabetes mellitus in 2012. However, their 
reports cite a further 2.2 million deaths 
attributable to excess risks from other causes 
related to high blood glucose levels, to give 
a total for 2012 of 3.7 million4,5. By contrast, 
the latest IDF Diabetes Atlas estimated 
that approximately 5.1 million deaths were 
attributable to diabetes mellitus among 
people aged 20–79 years in 2013 (REF. 3).
These major discrepancies largely stem 
from the futility of reporting mortality 
related to diabetes mellitus solely on the 
basis of death certificates, as used in the 
GBDC report47 in 2013 and by the WHO58 
in 2014. The 2015 IDF estimate of 5 million 
deaths per year places diabetes mellitus, 
along with ischaemic heart disease and 
cerebrovascular disease (5.73 million and 
4.58 million deaths per year, respectively), as 
one of the top three major worldwide causes 
of death from an NCD3. A similar figure is 
seen for accidental injuries (of all types), 
which are responsible for ~4.8 million 
deaths per year. A very disturbing feature is 
the extent that mortality related to diabetes 
mellitus has increased in recent years from 
about 2.0 million deaths in 2000 (REF. 50) to 
about 5.0 million in 2015 (REF. 3).
Increases in the global prevalence 
of diabetes mellitus in the past decade, 
especially in younger and middle aged 
adults1,2 in developing countries, will lead to 
yet further increases in deaths attributable 
to diabetes mellitus in the future.
The consequences of high and increasing 
mortality from diabetes mellitus include 
rising numbers of life years lost, increases 
in disability adjusted life years and reduced 
The economic cost of diabetes mellitus is 
enormous. Some 12% of global expenditure 
on health is attributable to the care of 
patients with diabetes mellitus and related 
complications3. The continuing global 
diabetes mellitus epidemic is very likely to lead 
to a massive increase in health expenditure in 
both developed and developing countries.
Conclusions
A number of approaches could address 
the issues raised in this Perspectives 
article. Firstly, there is a compelling need 
for international consensus on uniform 
standards and criteria for reporting 
national data on the prevalence of 
diabetes mellitus. Secondly, better and 
up-to-date prevalence data from countries 
that lack such information are needed. 
Thirdly, information on relative risk of 
death is needed, especially in developing 
nations, to measure and monitor diabetes 
mellitus mortality. Fourthly, international 
standardized criteria for recognition, 
diagnosis and reporting for common 
complications of diabetes mellitus need to be 
developed. Finally, there must be a greater 
emphasis on the importance of monitoring 
secular changes to enable us to address the 
UN7 and World Health Assembly8 mandates.
Clearly, diabetes mellitus has become, 
and remains, perhaps the single most 
important public health challenge of the 
twenty-first century2. Major gaps still exist 
in our capacity to understand the burden it 
imposes both globally and nationally, and 
especially in low and middle income nations. 
For these reasons, international consensus 
and action is needed to ensure that the data 
needs are fulfilled by united global action. 
Only then will the real effect of diabetes 
mellitus on health, its socioeconomic burden 
and the range of interventions and resources 
needed to address and turn the epidemic 
around be understood.

life expectancy, all of which have important 
social and economic consequences. The one 
glimmer of hope is that in some developed 
countries, such as Sweden49 and the USA59, 
the individual risk of death in people with 
diabetes mellitus now seems to be falling 
as a result of improved management 
and treatment. However, the increases 
in diabetes mellitus prevalence in most 
nations over the past few years are likely to 
outweigh these improvements and lead to 
further future increases in mortality related 
to diabetes mellitus.
Assessing complications
Most of the global burden of diabetes mellitus 
is due to morbidity and mortality that arises 
from complications of the disease2,47,60. These 
complications commonly include excessive 
rates of coronary heart disease, heart failure, 
stroke, renal insufficiency and end-stage renal 
disease, retinopathy and blindness, peripheral 
sensory and motor neuropathy and lower 
extremity amputations60. The incidence of 
these and other complications increases with 
duration of diabetes mellitus and leads to 
disability and reduced life expectancy60.
Unfortunately, no internationally 
recognized standardized classification, 
definitions or diagnostic criteria for the 
complications of diabetes mellitus are 
currently available. Consequently, the 
extent that they contribute to morbidity 
and mortality is unknown. If this issue 
were addressed, important advances in 
describing and understanding the burden 
they represent as well as help in defining 
eligibility and outcome measures for clinical 
trials would ensue.
