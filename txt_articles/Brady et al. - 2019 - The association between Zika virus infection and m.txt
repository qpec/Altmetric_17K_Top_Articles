Abstract
Background
In 2015, high rates of microcephaly were reported in Northeast Brazil following the first
South American Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak. Reported microcephaly rates in other Zika-
affected areas were significantly lower, suggesting alternate causes or the involvement of
arboviral cofactors in exacerbating microcephaly rates.
Methods and findings
We merged data from multiple national reporting databases in Brazil to estimate exposure
to 9 known or hypothesized causes of microcephaly for every pregnancy nationwide since
the beginning of the ZIKV outbreak; this generated between 3.6 and 5.4 million cases
(depending on analysis) over the time period 1 January 2015–23 May 2017. The association
between ZIKV and microcephaly was statistically tested against models with alternative
causes or with effect modifiers. We found no evidence for alternative non-ZIKV causes of
the 2015–2017 microcephaly outbreak, nor that concurrent exposure to arbovirus infection
or vaccination modified risk. We estimate an absolute risk of microcephaly of 40.8 (95% CI
34.2–49.3) per 10,000 births and a relative risk of 16.8 (95% CI 3.2–369.1) given ZIKV infec-
tion in the first or second trimester of pregnancy; however, because ZIKV infection rates
were highly variable, most pregnant women in Brazil during the ZIKV outbreak will have
been subject to lower risk levels. Statistically significant associations of ZIKV with other birth

analyse the data publicly available and provided
extensive summaries of the dataset in S1 Text,
section 1.1 and 1.2 to increase transparency:
 defects were also detected, but at lower relative risks than that of microcephaly (relative risk
< 1.5). Our analysis was limited by missing data prior to the establishment of nationwide
ZIKV surveillance, and its findings may be affected by unmeasured confounding causes of
microcephaly not available in routinely collected surveillance data.
Conclusions
This study strengthens the evidence that congenital ZIKV infection, particularly in the first 2
trimesters of pregnancy, is associated with microcephaly and less frequently with other birth
defects. The finding of no alternative causes for geographic differences in microcephaly rate
leads us to hypothesize that the Northeast region was disproportionately affected by this
Zika outbreak, with 94% of an estimated 8.5 million total cases occurring in this region, sug-
gesting a need for seroprevalence surveys to determine the underlying reason.
Author summary
Why was this study done?
• In late 2015 above average rates of the congenital malformation microcephaly were
reported in Northeast Brazil.
• This coincided with the first introduction of Zika in the Americas, and evidence of the
association between Zika virus infection in pregnancy and microcephaly shortly
followed.
• However, considerably lower rates of microcephaly were later observed elsewhere in
Brazil and in other areas to which Zika subsequently spread.
• This led to suggestions of alternative causes or cofactors present in Northeast Brazil and
uncertainty over the magnitude of risk that women infected with Zika in pregnancy
faced.
What did the researchers do and find?
• In this study we attempted to assemble information on 9 known or hypothesized causes
of microcephaly for every birth in Brazil since the beginning of the Zika outbreak. We
then statistically tested different hypotheses about the cause of the 2015–2017 micro-
cephaly outbreak nationwide.
• We found no evidence for alternative non-Zika causes of the microcephaly outbreak
nor did we find evidence that microcephaly risk was modified by concurrent dengue
infection or previous yellow fever vaccination.
• Women infected with Zika virus early in pregnancy were 17 times (95% confidence
interval 3–369) more likely to have a child with microcephaly.
• We found that microcephaly risk was highest in women with Zika infection in the first 2
trimesters, and that these women may also be at higher risk of developing other non-
microcephaly birth defects, but that this is a rarer outcome of congenital Zika infection.

 What do these findings mean?
• These findings add to the growing evidence that Zika infection early in pregnancy has a
generalisable association with microcephaly and, to a lesser extent, a range of other
birth defects.
• What this study adds is the ability to map the impact of Zika across broad areas, and it
leads us to hypothesize that Northeast Brazil experienced a significantly more substan-
tial Zika outbreak than the rest of the country, with 92% of an estimated 8.5 million
Zika cases.
• Community-representative seroprevalence surveys across Brazil are needed to test this
hypothesis and give insights into the risk of further Zika outbreaks in Brazil.
Introduction
Near the end of 2015, an abnormally high rate of the congenital malformation microcephaly
was reported from the 7 of the states in Northeast Brazil [1]. This event coincided with the first
known introduction of the Zika virus (ZIKV) into South America, which subsequently spread
throughout the continent, causing the World Health Organization to declare a Public Health
Emergency of International Concern in February 2016 [2].
Since then, a growing body of evidence has linked ZIKV infection during pregnancy with
microcephaly and other adverse birth outcomes [3–6]. There are also suggestions that ZIKV
could be associated with a wider range of congenital and developmental abnormalities, some
of which may not be apparent until later in a child’s life [4,7,8]. The rates of microcephaly ini-
tially reported in states in Northeast Brazil (up to 56.7 per 10,000 births) have not been docu-
mented in other Brazilian states (5.5–14.5 per 10,000 births) nor in other countries to which
ZIKV has since spread [9–11].
Microcephaly is a manifestation of in utero growth abnormalities that lead to an abnormally
small head size. In more severe cases, growth restriction affects the brain and central nervous
system (CNS), which may lead to considerable permanent cognitive impairments, if the infant
survives. Microcephaly is a known outcome of a variety of factors, including chromosomal dis-
orders and other genetic syndromes, infections during pregnancy (e.g., rubella, toxoplasmo-
sis), and exposure to harmful toxins during pregnancy. In the absence of major viral
outbreaks, the condition affects between 0.4 and 4.3 individuals per 10,000 births [12]. Mea-
suring this baseline rate in Brazil has been challenging due to changing definitions of the con-
dition [11] and considerable subnational variation. In Brazil at the time of the Zika epidemic, a
diagnosis of ‘suspected microcephaly’ was given if the infant’s head circumference was signifi-
cantly below average at birth (<2 standard deviations below the mean for gestational age and
sex). Presence of CNS growth defects can only be confirmed through cranial imaging tech-
niques, typically via computerised tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
scans. Children with a small head circumference at birth and with imaging evidence of abnor-
mal brain or CNS development were given a definition of ‘confirmed microcephaly’ in routine
reporting systems. Limited availability of diagnostic imaging in Brazil in late 2015 meant many
suspected cases were still under investigation, thus hampering the interpretation of reported

 rates at the time. Since then, follow-up testing of affected children has addressed some of these
gaps in surveillance for microcephaly.
Geographic differences in microcephaly rates since the ZIKV outbreak began have
prompted suggestions that there may be additional, as-of-yet unknown effect modifiers or
causes at play in Northeast Brazil [13]. These could include coinfection with, or immune
enhancement following past exposure to, flaviviruses and alphaviruses that are closely related
to ZIKV such as dengue and chikungunya viruses. Enhancement of Zika disease following
prior dengue virus exposure has been demonstrated in vitro [14] and in mice models [15] but
has been questioned in analyses of human sera [16]. The rural distribution of reported micro-
cephaly cases in some areas (an unusual feature given the urban preference of ZIKV-transmit-
ting Aedes mosquitoes) has also led some to suggest the possible involvement of drinking
water contamination [13] or zoonotic causes such as bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV),
which can cause birth defects in cattle [17].
Testing such hypotheses has been challenging for a combination of practical and theoretical
reasons. First, sample sizes for prospective cohort studies would need to be prohibitively large
to test multiple effect modifier hypotheses for a disease where up to 65%–83% of cases may be
asymptomatic [18,19] and at a time when the epidemic is in decline. Second, retrospective
analyses of routine surveillance data need to account for changing definitions of microcephaly
and changing practices in Zika case notification over time and be at a sufficiently fine geo-
graphic scale to relate one to another. Third, there remains considerable uncertainty in the
baseline rate of non-ZIKV-attributable microcephaly and its subnational variation.
In this study, we tested for an association between ZIKV and a range of congenital malfor-
mations while controlling for other causes that may have influenced the increase in micro-
cephaly observed in Brazil. We used multiple national-level databases to estimate the level of
ecological exposure to ZIKV and other known and hypothesized causes of microcephaly for
each pregnancy since the beginning of the ZIKV outbreak. We then used this large dataset to
statistically compare different hypotheses for the observed pattern of microcephaly, with the
aim of characterising the magnitude and statistical significance of the ZIKV–microcephaly
association.
Methods
Data sources
For every live birth in Brazil, the presence or absence of congenital abnormalities is recorded
in national health statistics. Information on exposure of each of these pregnancies to a range of
harmful pathogens, such as ZIKV, is usually not obtained or recorded, however. As a result,
our approach relied on producing an individually tailored high-resolution estimate of likely
exposure over pregnancy by matching pregnancy timing (week between conception and birth)
and location (municipality of residence of the mother) to information on candidate exposures
(Zika, dengue, chikungunya, BVDV, and water toxins) contained in other databases. Given
the brief duration of the ZIKV outbreak in most municipalities (mean of 3 weeks; S1 Text, sec-
tion 1.1), this approach provides a much more specific measure of exposure than aggregated
data.
Individual-level data on all live births between 1 January 2015 and 23 May 2017 were
extracted from the Sistema de Informac
¸ões sobre Nascidos Vivos (SINASC) database, which
also included data on age and race of the mother, sex of the baby, pregnancy date, and munici-
pality of residence of the mother (5,485 municipalities). Any birth defects apparent at birth
were recorded in SINASC using ICD-10 standards. Since the beginning of December 2015,
notification of microcephaly to the Registro de Eventos em Sau
´de Pu
´blica (RESP) system—

 manifest in utero, at birth, or postpartum—has been mandatory. Here we distinguish 2 types
of microcephaly: morphological microcephaly (MM) and microcephaly with structural CNS
defects (hereafter termed microcephaly with structural brain defects [MWSD]), originally
reported as ‘suspected microcephaly’ and ‘confirmed microcephaly’, respectively.
From 13 March 2016 onwards [20,21], MM was diagnosed if the infant’s head circumfer-
ence at birth was less than or equal to 31.9 cm for male or 31.5 cm for female babies. MWSD
was diagnosed if subsequent imaging techniques (primarily CT and MRI scanning; S1 Text,
section 1.2) revealed brain or CNS developmental abnormalities. Here we focus our analysis
on births with MWSD, as MWSD is the more severe outcome of the condition and is less
affected by natural variations in infant growth size. We also performed the same analyses on
MM and report all results in S2 Text, section 2.4. Records with MWSD in RESP (cases) were
standardised to the definition used from March 2016 onwards, then matched to their corre-
sponding record in SINASC using a deterministic matching algorithm (S1 Text, section 1.6),
with identified duplicates removed from SINASC. All MWSD cases (RESP) were then com-
pared to all control (non-microcephaly) births (SINASC).
Weekly Zika, dengue, and chikungunya PCR-confirmed cases in each municipality were
obtained from the Sistema de Informac
¸ão de Agravos de Notificac
¸ão (SINAN). We only consid-
ered Zika data as reliable after the date of 8 December 2015; before this date Zika reporting was
sporadic, non-compulsory, and not PCR tested, and therefore we assign ‘no data’ values to all
weeks before this date. Weekly counts were converted into incidence rates using municipality-
level population data to give a probability of infection within each municipality for each week
[22]. For each pregnancy, the mean weekly incidence experienced between conception and the
week of birth (candidate cause and other birth defect models; Fig 1) and the mean weekly inci-
dence among defined stages of pregnancy (time-specific exposure models) were calculated.
Weeks with missing data were omitted from the mean calculation (i.e., we assumed these data
were missing at random). We chose to focus our analysis on PCR-confirmed cases due to a lack
of specificity of clinical diagnosis among arboviral diseases with similar symptoms. As much of
the PCR testing was done at central laboratories, little geographic variation in testing rate or
positivity rate was observed (S1 Text, section 1.1). We also repeated the analysis using clinically
suspected cases of Zika, dengue, and chikungunya and report the results in S2 Text, section 2.4.
Yellow fever vaccination coverage in each municipality in the year 2016 was obtained from
Shearer et al. [23] (untargeted unbiased scenario), which used multi-year data on age-specific
doses delivered from the Brazilian national immunisation programme. National data on inci-
dence of waterborne pesticides and toxins were not available. Instead we used a proxy of expo-
sure, a time-varying drinking water quality index (S1 Text, section 1.3). For exposure to
potential bovine viruses, viral agent testing data were unavailable, so we used the density of
farms per square kilometre in each municipality as a proxy for exposure.
The socio-demographic status of each municipality was quantified using a socio-demo-
graphic index (S1 Text, section 1.5) that distinguishes levels of income, education, and fertility
between areas using data from the 2010 Brazilian census [22].
All disease incidence rates, yellow fever vaccination rates, and cattle density variables were
zero-inflated by half the minimum observed incidence value then log transformed. No collinear-
ity was detected between all combinations of covariates (all variance inflation factors below 2.5).
Data selection
Missing or implausible information at the individual level was found in a small number of rec-
ords (0.28%; S1 Text, section 1.4), which were removed from the regression analysis (assumed
missing at random, minimal difference in characteristics; S1 Text, section 1.4).

 Because ZIKV surveillance was only established nationwide in December 2015, and the
majority of MWSD cases occurred in early 2016, we were not able to identify full exposure his-
tories for the majority of MWSD cases. We therefore generated 2 separate datasets: (i) a ‘sum-
mary exposure history’ dataset that requires information on exposure to ZIKV during 1 or
more weeks of pregnancy and (ii) a ‘full exposure history’ dataset that requires information on
exposure to ZIKV in at least 1 week in each of trimesters 1, 2, and 3 as well as the time period
10 weeks prior to conception (Fig 1 and S1 Text, section 1.4). These 2 data selections balance
minimising data selection (and thus selection bias and maintaining sample size) and accurately
defining exposure.

 Hypothesis testing for causes of MWSD
To identify the most likely cause of the excess MWSD cases observed in Brazil, a number of
candidate statistical models with different hypothesized exposures were formally compared.
Candidate primary exposures during pregnancy included (i) Zika, (ii) dengue, (iii) chikungu-
nya, (iv) BVDV, and (v) water toxins. In addition, we also tested for interaction exposures
between Zika and (i) dengue, (ii) chikungunya, and (iii) prior yellow fever vaccination. Inter-
action exposures are intended to test if coinfection (or sequential infection within pregnancy)
confers risk beyond ZIKV exposure alone or if prior yellow fever vaccine elevates risk for expo-
sures to ZIKV in pregnancy. Interaction exposures were calculated by multiplying the ZIKV
exposure variable by the candidate interaction exposures. Due to the rarity of some congenital
abnormalities, including MWSD, Firth’s penalised logistic regression [24] was chosen to test
for associations in all analyses. The summary exposure history dataset was chosen for this anal-
ysis because of its high representativeness of the early stages of the outbreak; however, this
does mean that the estimates of relative risk may be unreliable (biased towards the null) if
exposure in early pregnancy has a greater effect than exposure at the end (see timing of expo-
sure analysis).
Because MWSD can also be caused by numerous other causes other than our candidate
exposures (e.g., environmental causes, genetic causes, and toxoplasmosis, other, rubella, cyto-
megalovirus, herpes, and syphilis [TORCH(S)] infections), in all exposure models we tested
for the inclusion of the following baseline risk factor variables: (i) mother’s age, (ii) sex of the
baby, and (iii) socioeconomic status. These variables have all previously been found to be asso-
ciated with a range of birth defects [25–27]. We also included variables for week (beginning 1
January 2015) and region (5 regions) to account for spatio-temporal variance not explained by
any of the other covariates.
All combinations of baseline risk factors were tested in combination with each hypothesized
exposure (32 baseline risk factor combinations × 8 hypothesized exposures = 256 candidate
models). The optimal combination of baseline risk factors for each exposure was chosen by
minimum Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), which was also used to compare between
exposures to identify the most parsimonious explanation for the observed pattern of MWSD.
Testing for associations between ZIKV and non-microcephaly birth defects
To test for an association between ZIKV and multiple non-microcephaly birth defects while
maintaining family-wide error rates, we prioritised hypothesis testing of (i) groups of birth
defects suspected or previously linked to maternal ZIKV infection and (ii) high-frequency (at
least 2 per 10,000 births) specific birth defects (S2 Text, section 2.6). For each birth defect out-
come, optimal baseline risk factor variables were selected by minimum AIC to account for
non-ZIKV causes of each birth defect. This analysis also used the summary exposure history
dataset to preserve sample size and because we had no prior suggestion that exposure late in
pregnancy differed from early exposure. Because of the large number of outcomes tested for
association (n = 12), Bonferroni correction was used to adjust p-values to maintain p = 0.05
equivalence.
Assessing timing of risk during pregnancy
To identify in which gestational periods maternal ZIKV infection was associated with
increased MWSD risk, we repeated the regression analysis with exposure disaggregated into 1
of 4 categories: prior to conception (up to 10 weeks prior), trimester 1, trimester 2, and trimes-
ter 3. This required using the full exposure history dataset that excluded many of the cases
from the first phase of the epidemic but had more complete information on each mother’s

 exposure over the duration of her pregnancy. Baseline risk factors were included and selected
by minimum AIC; however, the single continuous covariate for ‘week’ and the 5-category
‘region’ covariate were further disaggregated to better account for residual spatial and tempo-
ral correlation and thus provide unbiased estimates of ZIKV relative risk. A fixed effect term
for each month between October 2015 and July 2016 (coinciding with the main MWSD out-
break) as well as terms for the years 2015, 2016, and 2017 for months outside this range were
included (increase from 1 to 12 temporal effects). Additionally, all births in states with inci-
dence greater than 9 MWSD cases per 10,000 live births were assigned a state-level fixed effect
(increase from 5 to 12 spatial effects).
The cumulative ZIKV incidences in trimesters 1 and 2 were found to be partially colinear
(R2 = 0.75) and were combined into a single covariate (cumulative Zika incidence in the first 2
trimesters). Further analysis with separated trimester data (detailed in S2 Text, section 2.5)
investigated the possible differential effects between exposure in trimesters 1 and 2.
Mapping MWSD relative and absolute risks and estimating Zika case
burden
Because microcephaly is a rare pregnancy outcome, a large number of births are required to
give accurate crude estimates of the true rate of microcephaly in each municipality. Because
such large numbers of births did not occur in many municipalities (S1 Text, section 1.2), we
generated smooth surfaces of microcephaly rate (averaged over the period January 2015–May
2017) that accounted for variable birth counts using a generalised additive model (GAM).
The GAM included counts of births with and without MWSD as the response and (i) a
2-dimensional thin-plate spline of latitude and longitude, (ii) the municipality-wide mean pre-
dicted ZIKV probability of occurrence from a Zika ecological niche map [28], (iii) the mean
socio-demographic index level of mothers in each municipality, and (iv) the mean age of
mothers in each municipality. Thin-plate splines were chosen for their 2-dimensional support,
with smoothing parameters selected by generalised cross validation with high starting optimi-
sation values (k = 1,000) to capture high spatial heterogeneity.
To estimate Zika case burden over the course of the entire epidemic, we back-projected the
incidence of Zika needed to generate the rate of MWSD cases observed according to our best
estimates of the ZIKV–MWSD association. We used the results from the time-specific expo-
sure model (Fig 1); while it was fit mostly to records in the second wave of the epidemic (Fig
1), it contained the most precise definition of exposure and generated the best estimate of
absolute and relative risk. For each municipality, all births over the time period were collated,
and the regression model coefficients (mean and 95% confidence intervals) were used to pre-
dict the baseline (i.e., in the absence of Zika) expected rate of MWSD cases (Jan 2015–May
2017). The residual between the predicted and observed rate of MWSD cases (after smoothing
with the mean prediction from the GAM mapping analysis) was combined with the parameter
estimates from the regression equation and used to solve for the ZIKV incidence needed in
each pregnancy to generate the observed MWSD rates.
All analyses were conducted in R version 3.3.3 [29] using the ‘logistf’ and ‘mgcv’ packages.
While we are not able to publicly share the individual-level data on pregnancies and their
health outcomes used in this analysis due to identifiability concerns, summaries aggregated at
a high spatio-temporal resolution (municipality and week) are freely available from the follow-
ing online repository: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.7359197.v1. We have made the code
used to analyse the data publicly available and have provided extensive summaries of the data-
set in S1 Text, section 1.1 and 1.2, to increase transparency (https://github.com/obrady/Brazil_

submission can be found in S1 IRB, the statistical analysis plan in S1 Analysis Plan, and the
STROBE checklist in S1 STROBE. Subsequent deviations from the analysis plan are detailed in
S1 Text, section 1.9, which included the need to define separate summary and full exposure
datasets due to the late establishment of Zika surveillance. Initial and modified results and a
discussion of the relevant changes are given in S1 Text, section 1.9.
Results
A total of 6,860,743 births occurred between 1 January 2015 and 23 May 2017. A total of 2,791
of these births resulted in MWSD, with the largest concentration between November 2015 and
May 2016 and elevated levels continuing to be observed throughout the rest of 2016 (Fig 1).
Because Zika surveillance was sporadic before December 2015, we selected 2 separate datasets:
summary exposure history (information on exposure at some point in pregnancy) and full
exposure history (information on exposure throughout pregnancy). In the summary exposure
dataset 2,202,714 (41%) pregnancies were potentially exposed to ZIKV at varying levels.
Cause of the 2015–2017 microcephaly outbreak
First, we tested for the presence of effect modifiers and alternative causes most likely to explain
the microcephaly epidemic observed in Brazil. This analysis was performed on the summary
exposure history dataset (Fig 1; 5,360,851 pregnancies with 2,282 MWSD cases). This main-
tained representativeness of the early stages of the outbreak but may bias estimates of relative
risk towards the null.
To distinguish the causes of this microcephaly epidemic from the long-term average back-
ground rate of MWSD and its spatial variation, we included a range of background risk vari-
ables in each regression. In nearly all models the covariates of sex of the baby and region were
retained (higher risk in the Northeast region and in female babies) while mother’s age, week,
and socio-demographic index level were removed by model selection (Fig 2).
Fig 2 shows the relative risks of MWSD given exposure to a range of candidate causes and
effect modifiers before and after adjusting for the local background rate. Exposure to ZIKV
alone is the most likely explanation of the observed pattern of MWSD, showing a significantly
larger reduction in AIC value over the baseline (no exposure) model than other hypothesized
exposures or models that considered arboviral effect modifiers (Fig 2). While other exposures
do show smaller magnitude but statistically significant associations with MWSD (e.g., dengue
and chikungunya in Fig 2), these were likely due to partial collinearity with Zika transmission
as they did not explain additional variance in models that also contained a Zika exposure vari-
able (Fig 2). This finding was also robust to the lower than average birth size usually observed
in the Northeast region (S2 Text, section 2.0) and the 15% reduction in birth rate that occurred
during the Zika outbreak (S2 Text, section 2.1). ZIKV was also identified as the most likely
cause when using aggregated data with an alternative (Poisson) model structure (S2 Text, sec-
tion 2.2). We also found no evidence for the involvement of race of the mother in this associa-
tion (S2 Text, section 2.3). Similar associations were found for MM and when using suspected
Zika cases instead of PCR-confirmed Zika cases (S2 Text, section 2.4).
Infection with ZIKV in the first 2 trimesters confers the greatest risk of
MWSD
Disaggregation of the ZIKV–microcephaly association by timing of infection during preg-
nancy using the full exposure history dataset (Fig 1) showed that risk is concentrated in the
first 2 trimesters of pregnancy (Fig 3). Due to collinearity between exposure in trimester 1 and

 trimester 2, we were unable to definitively state which conferred the higher risk. However, test-
ing model combinations with either trimester 1 or trimester 2 omitted (S2 Text, section 2.5)
gave some evidence that infection in the second trimester conferred a higher risk of MWSD.
We found that ZIKV infection preconception (up to 10 weeks) may also confer elevated
risk, but at a lower level than infection in trimester 1 or 2. We found no association between
third trimester infection and elevated risk of MWSD. The same findings were reached using
MM (S2 Text, section 2.4), except relative risk was nonsignificant for preconception ZIKV
infection.

 Estimating absolute and relative risk of MWSD given ZIKV infection in
pregnancy
The time-specific exposure models provide the most precise estimate of the magnitude of the
association between ZIKV and MWSD because it clearly defines exposure and includes a
larger number of spatio-temporal covariates to appropriately capture the variation in MWSD
due to background non-ZIKV causes, e.g., genetic, environmental, and TORCH(S) infections.
Using the predictions from this model in the absence of any Zika suggested a mean national
MWSD rate of 0.94 (95% CI 0.02–2.71) per 10,000 births, with the highest background rates in
the Central-West and Northeast regions (S1 Text, section 1.7). When using the expanded defi-
nition of MM, this background rate increased to 1.80 (95% CI 1.77–1.82), which is likely to be
a more comparable figure with ongoing microcephaly surveillance efforts outside Brazil [12].
Predicted baseline rates were also marginally higher in female babies (relative risk 1.25 [95%
CI 1.05–1.48]), higher in the latter half of 2016 towards the end of the ZIKV outbreak, and
higher in the northern state of Amapa
´, with the last 2 findings possibly due to increased sur-
veillance efforts.
This would imply that 645 (95% CI 149–1,854) of the 2,791 MWSD cases were due to non-
Zika background causes. Over the same time period 152 TORCH(S)-positive MWSD cases
were reported; however, only a subset were tested (2,004 of 2,791 tested), and the test covered
only a small number of potential causes of microcephaly, and may have been used at the
wrong time in pregnancy.
Women whose first or second trimester of pregnancy occurred during a Zika outbreak had,
on average, a 4.55 (95% CI 3.14–6.52) relative risk of MWSD compared to women pregnant
before or after the outbreak (Fig 3); however, this relative risk varied considerably depending
on the size of the ZIKV outbreak in the municipality of residence. To the best of our knowl-
edge, only 1 study has measured true ZIKV attack rate in humans using population representa-
tive IgG seroprevalence surveys [30], finding an attack rate of 66% in the northeastern city of
Salvador, Bahia. Adjusting our estimate for this municipality (Table 1) yields a relative risk of
MWSD for an individual mother infected during pregnancy of 16.80 (95% CI 3.21–369.10).

 Mapping ZIKV-attributable MWSD rate and relative risk (Fig 4A and 4B) showed high het-
erogeneity in exposure and subsequent risk. Some women living in the Northeast region expe-
rienced a relative risk closer to 20–30, which corresponded to a rate of 15–27 MWSD cases per
10,000 births, whereas in most other areas rates were much lower.
A consistent association suggests ZIKV disproportionately impacted
Northeast Brazil
Regular and reliable Zika surveillance was not established until December 2015, by which time
ZIKV had already been circulating in Brazil for 9–22 months [31–33], causing an unknown
number of cases. Using the rate of reported MWSD cases and the ZIKV–microcephaly associa-
tion quantified above, we estimated the number of cases that would have been identified had
the surveillance system been in place since January 2015 and assuming Zika was the only cause
of the excess microcephaly rates observed (i.e., no unmeasured confounding; S2 Text, section
2.5). This approach suggests 8.5 (95% CI 1.1–29.8) million symptomatic Zika cases have
occurred in Brazil since the beginning of the outbreak (Table 2 and Fig 4D). Northeast Brazil
has been the worst affected region, with 94% (95% CI 90%–97%) of total estimated cases.
There was also considerable heterogeneity in incidence within the Northeast region, with the
coastal states of Rio Grande do Norte, Paraı
´ba, Pernambuco, Alagoas, and Sergipe worst
affected. Some areas of the North region also experienced Zika incidence levels comparable to
that of the Northeast region, particularly the state of Roraima (Fig 4C). Comparisons between
estimated and reported cases (Table 2) suggest that only a small fraction (<1%) of the total
Zika cases were reported in areas where the outbreak began, such as the Northeast region,
whereas underreporting was much lower in areas that didn’t see significant transmission until
later in the outbreak (e.g., Southeast region, 3% of cases reported).
Zika also shows lower magnitude associations with some other congenital
abnormalities detectable at birth
To test for any other potential congenital impacts of ZIKV, we repeated this test for association
between ZIKV and different types of non-microcephaly congenital outcomes. This involved
using the summary exposure history dataset with 5,360,851 births and 34,757 notified birth
defects (Fig 1). These only included birth defects that were apparent and diagnosable at birth,
were reported through routine birth reporting systems (SINASC), and were independent of
the microcephaly reporting system (RESP).
After adjusting for non-ZIKV causes with the basic variables, we found a statistically signifi-
cant association between Zika and polydactyly, hypospadias, feet deformities, hydrocephalus,
and a larger group of eye, head and neck, and brain defects (chi-squared, all p < 0.01; Fig 5).
In addition, musculoskeletal birth defects were also significant in the MM analysis (S2 Text,
section 2.4). While statistically significant, the Zika-attributable rate and relative risk of these
defects was considerably lower than that of microcephaly (1.1–1.5 versus 4.1; Fig 5 and
Table 1), suggesting they were a rarer outcome of congenital ZIKV infection compared to
microcephaly.
Discussion
Here we present to our knowledge the first individual-level analysis of all births in Brazil since
the beginning of the most recent ZIKV outbreak. We show that despite lower rates of micro-
cephaly being reported outside Northeast Brazil, there was a consistent association between
Zika and microcephaly that was not modified by arboviral effect modifiers or other

 environmental causes. Infection in the first 2 trimesters is likely to confer the greatest risk,
with women living in average ZIKV outbreak areas subject to a 4.55 (95% CI 3.14–6.52) rela-
tive risk of MWSD and possible minor increased risk of other birth defects. This consistent
association suggests that an estimated 8.5 (95% CI 1.1–29.8) million symptomatic Zika cases

 have occurred in Brazil since the beginning of the outbreak, with the majority (>90%) concen-
trated in the Northeast region.
A major limitation of this study is the use of an observational ecological measure of expo-
sure, made necessary by the low rates of reliable ZIKV testing in pregnant women during the
ZIKV outbreak. We have tried to limit the impact of this by using individual-level data to cre-
ate a much higher spatio-temporal resolution match than is normally possible in ecological
studies. One advantage of this ecological approach is its insensitivity to underreporting and
the proportion of ZIKV infections that are symptomatic, if both remain consistent over space
and time. This is important as a large proportion of Zika [34] and potentially microcephaly
[35] cases are likely to have not been reported by routine surveillance. For our analysis, this
may bias estimates of absolute risk, but not estimates of relative risk or strength of association.
We were also able to translate our community-level estimates of relative risk to an individual
level using data on ZIKV infection rates from the city of Salvador, estimating that a mother
infected in pregnancy has a 16.80 (95% CI 3.21–369.10) relative risk of her child being born
with MWSD. This individual-level relative risk overlaps with estimates from case–control—73
(95% CI 13–1) [5]—and population-level observational studies—53.4 (95% CI 6.5–1061.2)
[36] and 18–127 [9]. This analysis refines the evidence base that ZIKV infection in pregnancy
is associated with an approximate 15- to 75-fold increase in microcephaly risk, highly depend-
ing on local baseline rate in the settings concerned. For the first time, to our knowledge, we
also show that this association is consistent across a wide area including a range of settings.
Our results suggest that the ZIKV–microcephaly association was not modified by coinfec-
tion with dengue or chikungunya viruses, nor was it modified by prior vaccination for yellow
fever. We were not able to test if dengue or chikungunya infection prior to pregnancy affected
the ZIKV–MWSD relationship. Due to limitations of passive data including misdiagnosis and
underlying immunity, prospective dengue cohort studies such as those established in Nicara-
gua [37] and Peru [38], where the timing of past exposure of individuals to dengue is well char-
acterised, offer the best opportunity for investigating the effect of possible ZIKV–dengue virus
cross-reaction on acute Zika disease severity. However, existing studies have not found strong
correlations between Zika disease severity and the risk of congenital outcomes [39,40].
Throughout the Zika epidemic, there has been concern that microcephaly may have been
the most apparent and most severe manifestation of a wide range of congenital abnormalities
caused by ZIKV [41]. The evidence presented here contests this hypothesis, with a significant,
high-magnitude association between ZIKV and microcephaly and a lack of any significant
association or only low-magnitude associations between ZIKV and other common birth
defects. While the specific links with eye defects, hypospadias, feet defects, and polydactyly
merit further investigation, especially given the implications of some for fertility [42], these
results suggest clinicians should focus principally on diagnosis of microcephaly in pregnant
women with suspected ZIKV infection. However, these findings are based on a basic clinical
assessment of newborns at the time of birth, and defects that only become apparent later in life
will not have been recorded in these databases. Recent evidence suggests that up to 24% of
microcephaly may only be diagnosable postnatally and that further developmental abnormali-
ties may also occur [43]. Further longer term studies are needed in children born to ZIKV-
infected (and non-ZIKV-infected) mothers to describe and measure the full lifetime burden of
ZIKV, such as ongoing studies by the EU-funded ZIKAllliance, ZikaPLAN, and ZIKAction
consortia.
A key weakness with retrospective data analyses, such as this, is the assumption of consis-
tency in reporting of exposure and outcomes. One alternative explanation for our findings
could be that the observed microcephaly epidemic may have, at least in part, been due to
improved reporting of microcephaly given the high public profile of the ZIKV–microcephaly

 association at the time. Despite considerable differences in laboratory testing and MRI/CT
scanning capacities in different parts of Brazil, we found no significant differences in testing
rate or positivity rate between states in Brazil (S1 Text, section 1.1 and 1.2), probably due to
the priority of Zika at the time and the high level of retrospective testing of samples. We also
found no evidence of testing fatigue (where cases are no longer tested after the first confirmed
case is reported; S1 Text, section 1.1.7). This means that even though not every suspected case
of Zika or microcephaly was tested, the data are still a good representation of the profile of
exposure and outcomes, supporting the validity of our assessment of association. We also (i)
endeavoured to standardise all notifications to the latest, most specific case definition of
microcephaly, (ii) included ‘time’ and ‘region’ variables to capture spatio-temporal variations
in reporting, vector control efforts, and treatment-seeking behaviours, and (iii) performed sen-
sitivity analyses using MM and suspected Zika cases, which gave similar results. Furthermore,
no increases in the rate of other notified birth defects were observed over this time period (S2
Text, section 2.7). Despite this, there remains some significant spatial and temporal autocorre-
lation in the residuals of our best-fitting Zika model, in particular model overestimation of risk
towards the end of the outbreak and in the state of Sao Paulo that could not be explained by
known factors (S2 Text, section 2.8). These unexplained patterns could be related to Zika (e.g.,
complex changes in the way cases of the disease are reported) or due to some other unknown
factor. Changes in surveillance practices would only bias our estimates of the magnitude of the
association between Zika and microcephaly, not reduce our statistical confidence or our find-
ings of Zika’s relative likelihood over other causes.
Because ZIKV surveillance was only established in December 2015, when the microcephaly
outbreak had already begun, a major limitation of our study was our inability to assemble full
exposure histories for over 3 million pregnancies, including for many of the MWSD cases
from the first wave of the outbreak. This shaped our decision to assemble separate summary
exposure history and full exposure history datasets. The full exposure history dataset may have
been subject to selection bias as it disproportionately samples cases from the second wave of
the epidemic and undersamples cases from the Northeast region. Aside from spatio-temporal
differences, however, we found no age, sex, or socio-demographic differences between the
population and selected records (S1 Text, section 1.2.1). The summary exposure dataset may
suffer from misclassification of exposure due to the censored nature of the data; this was not
formally accounted for in our model. Formally accounting for censoring in future modelling
analyses using Bayesian hierarchical frameworks with multiple imputation for missing data
may explain more of the spatio-temporal variation in MWSD and lead to more precise risk
estimates for the ZIKV–MWSD association. We were also limited to the spatial scale of munic-
ipality for our analyses; variable municipal size across Brazil may introduce variation in spatial
precision when mapping the rate of MWSD.
The observational nature of the analysis also means it may be subject to unmeasured con-
founding, especially given the multiple causes of microcephaly. In particular, we did not
include exposure measures for TORCH(S) pathogens due to incomplete testing data. Our
model-predicted baseline rate of 11% [4–32] of MWSD cases being due to non-ZIKV causes
was comparable with the observed 8% of MWSD cases that were TORCH(S) positive among
those who were tested. Due to computational constraints, we were not able to assess the stabil-
ity of included baseline risk covariates through bootstrap sampling [44], which may limit our
ability to accurately identify factors associated with the baseline risk of MWSD. Finally, we did
not propagate record linkage uncertainty between the SINASC and RESP databases, which
may have led to a small number of duplicates in our dataset and a very small bias towards the
null, which could have been resolved with the use of multiple imputation.

 We found that risk of MWSD was highest when ZIKV infection occurred in the first 2 tri-
mesters of pregnancy. This is consistent with previous studies on ZIKV [6,36,39] and other
acute infectious diseases where there is not only a hypothesized impact on the early fundamen-
tal stages of neurodevelopment, but also impacts that make subsequent development and mat-
uration more likely to malfunction [45].
The finding that ZIKV infection prior to conception confers no elevated risk of microceph-
aly may be subject to survivor bias as we had no way to detect fetal demise with the databases
used in this analysis. Fetal demise would also have the effect of underestimating relative risk of
MWSD given ZIKV infection and underestimating the strength of association between these
variables.
The strength of this analysis is its broad geographic scope and scale. We were able to analyse
outcomes of between 3.6 and 5.9 million births in Brazil since 2015, allowing new levels of pre-
cision and generalisability in assessing rare congenital defects. With the now declining ZIKV
epidemic limiting opportunities for new data collection, retrospective analyses of routinely col-
lected data may provide the best possible approach to characterise the association between
Zika and congenital abnormalities.
Conclusions
This study adds further evidence that ZIKV infection in the early stages of pregnancy is associ-
ated with an elevated risk of microcephaly, with relative risk 16.80 (95% CI 3.21–369.10). Con-
centration of this risk in the first 2 trimesters of pregnancy suggests that women infected prior
to conception or late in pregnancy are unlikely to be at excess risk. Here we found no evidence
that the association between ZIKV and microcephaly was modified by arboviral exposure nor
did we find strong evidence of alternative causes, and thus we hypothesize that the most likely
reason why Northeast Brazil reported higher microcephaly rates was because it had more cases
of Zika. We know that ZIKV circulated undetected, and thus uncontrolled, in the region for
9–22 months [31–33], and that year-round transmission suitability [46] in the Northeast
region has historically led to higher dengue attack rates [47]. However, only seroprevalence
surveys across the country can confirm this hypothesis and help us understand why the North-
east region was so adversely impacted. Such studies are vital for estimating the future risk of
Zika and microcephaly outbreaks across the region.
