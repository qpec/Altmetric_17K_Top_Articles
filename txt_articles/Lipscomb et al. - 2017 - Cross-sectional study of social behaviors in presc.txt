Abstract
Background: Children are exposed to flame retardants from the built environment. Brominated diphenyl ethers
(BDE) and organophosphate-based flame retardants (OPFRs) are associated with poorer neurocognitive functioning
in children. Less is known, however, about the association between these classes of compounds and children’s
emotional and social behaviors. The objective of this study was to determine if flame retardant exposure was
associated with measurable differences in social behaviors among children ages 3–5 years.
Methods: We examined teacher-rated social behaviors measured using the Social Skills Improvement Rating Scale (SSIS)
and personal exposure to flame retardants in children aged 3–5 years who attended preschool (n = 72). Silicone passive
samplers worn for 7 days were used to assess personal exposure to 41 compounds using gas chromatography-mass
spectrophotometer. These concentrations were then summed into total BDE and total OPFR exposure prior to natural log
transformation. Separate generalized additive models were used to evaluate the relationship between seven subscales of
the SSIS and lnΣBDE or lnΣOPFR adjusting for other age, sex, adverse social experiences, and family context.
Results: All children were exposed to a mixture of flame retardant compounds. We observed a dose dependent
relationship between lnΣOPFR and two subscales where children with higher exposures were rated by their preschool
teachers as having less responsible behavior (p = 0.07) and more externalizing behavior problems (p = 0.03). Additionally,
children with higher lnΣBDE exposure were rated by teachers as less assertive (p = 0.007).
Conclusions: We observed a cross-sectional association between children’s exposure to flame retardant compounds and
teacher-rated social behaviors among preschool-aged children. Children with higher flame retardant exposures exhibited
poorer social skills in three domains that play an important role in a child’s ability to succeed academically and socially.

Background
Early childhood is a key developmental period for learning
appropriate social behaviors. Individual differences in ex-
ternalizing behaviors, such as hyperactivity, inattention,
aggressive, and oppositional behaviors, that emerge during
early childhood often persist throughout childhood [1, 2].
Furthermore, children who exhibit more externalizing be-
haviors tend to struggle more in both academic and social
domains [3–5] and are more likely to develop mental ill-
ness by adulthood [6]. In contrast, young children who
show more positive social behaviors, such as cooperation,
assertiveness, and self-control, tend to have more success
in school [7] and show more positive school adjustment,
motivation, and involvement in learning [8].
Much of the prior research on the etiology of social be-
havior in early childhood has focused on children’s social
experiences, at home and preschool, as well as children’s
genetics [9, 10]. Yet there is concern that chemicals com-
monly found in children’s environments may adversely in-
fluence social and emotional behavioral development [11].

 For instance, epidemiological studies have reported that
children with higher lead exposure have a greater prob-
ability of demonstrating negative social behaviors in tod-
dlers, children, and young teens [12–14]. Exposure to
bisphenol A (BPA), an endocrine disrupting chemical, has
also been linked to behavioral outcomes in young children
[15, 16]. Another study reported an association between
polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) exposure during develop-
ment and a greater risk of exhibiting attention-deficit and
autistic-like behavior in childhood [17].
There is also considerable interest in whether exposure
to flame retardants can influence children’s behavioral
development. Flame retardants, namely brominated flame
retardants (BFRs) and organophosphate-based flame retar-
dants (OPFRs) are widely used in furniture, building mate-
rials, plastics, and electronics to reduce their flammability
in order to meet fire safety standards [18]. Biomonitoring
studies show that BFRs have increased in people over time
[19] and are almost an order of magnitude higher in the
U.S. compared to European and Asian populations [20].
Children also appear to have greater exposure to flame re-
tardants as reflected by having much higher levels of BFRs
in their blood compared to their mothers [21]. Several pro-
spective epidemiological studies report that in utero expos-
ure or early life exposure to selected BDE congeners (e.g.
BDE-28, -47, -99, -100, or -153) are associated with adverse
neurological
developmental,
attention
deficits,
poorer
behavioral regulation, or social competence in children
[22–31]. Very little is currently known about how exposure
to OPFRs affect children’s neurodevelopment or social be-
haviors. Although data from experimental studies indicate
that
tris(2-chloroethyl)phosphate
(TCEP)
and
tris(1,3-
dichloropropyl)phosphate (TDCPP) affect neurodevelop-
mental responses in experimental systems [32, 33].
The current study expands prior research on the associ-
ation between flame retardants and social behaviors by
building on an existing study of preschool aged children
[34, 35]. The objective of the study was to examine the as-
sociation between two different classes of flame retardants
(PBDEs and OPFRs) and preschool children’s social be-
haviors as assessed by the Social Skills Improvement Sys-
tem - Rating Scales (SSIS-RS) which is a clinically relevant
assessment [36]. The scores from SSIS-RS also capture
normal variation in children’s behaviors that predicts suc-
cess in academic and social domains [37]. Furthermore,
this study controlled for important psychosocial stressors
that negatively affect behavior [38].
Methods
Study population and procedures
From October 2012 to January 2013, ninety-two children
between the ages of 3–5 years old were recruited from
28 preschool classrooms in two geographic areas of
Oregon, USA. Written informed consent was obtained
from the parent and/or legal guardian for all participants
and from all preschool teachers prior to engaging in any
study activity. Child assent was indicated by their en-
gagement with the materials and/or project staff.
Researchers visited participants’ homes where parents
completed a series of structured questionnaires to capture
socio-demographic information (e.g. household income,
parental education levels, race, etc.) and the home learning
environment. During this visit, each child was given a sili-
cone passive wristband sampler to wear around his/her
wrist or ankle. This sampler was used to assess the child’s
exposure to flame retardants. Parents were requested to
have their child wear the wristband continuously for 7 days,
although it could be taken off at night and placed next to
the child’s bed on a table if preferred. After 7 days, parents
were instructed to seal the wristband in the polytetrafluoro-
ethylene (PTFE) bag, note the number of days the child ac-
tually wore the wristband on the chain of custody tag, and
place it in the mail. The concentration of flame retardants
measured in the silicone passive wristband sampler were
also reported back to the participants. Children’s social be-
haviors were assessed using the Social Skills Improvement
System - Rating Scales by their teacher in the preschools
they were attending.
Of the 92 wristbands distributed to the children, 77 were
returned for analysis. Of those, five samples were excluded
due to parent report of substantial deviance from the proto-
col (e.g. never worn by the child, lost at school for several
weeks, or went through the laundry). Additionally, three
parents chose not to answer questions on the socio-
demographic questionnaire, which left a final sample size of
69 children with complete data that were included in the
final analyses.
Ethical statement
All research activities were approved by Oregon State
University’s Institutional Review Board. All parents gave
informed written consent and children gave assent before
partaking in any research activity. Results from the chem-
ical results from the wristbands were returned to the par-
ents. Due to the novelty of the exposure assessment
methodology there were no other populations that could
serve as a comparison for this study. Subsequently, par-
ents were told which flame retardants were detected in
their children’s sample and where their child’s exposure
ranked within this group of children (e.g. in the lowest
25th percentile, in the 25th to 75th percentile, or highest
25th percentile). Parents were also given resources created
by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry
where they could learn more about flame retardants and
resources created by the Oregon Environmental Council’s
Eco-Health Homes Checkup Kit where they could learn
about how to reduce exposure to pollutants in their home
including flame retardants.

 Social behavior assessment
The teacher form of the Social Skills Improvement System
Rating Scale (SSIS-RS) was used to measure children’s so-
cial behavior in preschool classrooms. The SSIS-RS is a
standardized assessment of social skills and problem be-
haviors for children ages 3–18 years, has strong psycho-
metric properties, and measures both normative and
clinically-relevant variation [36]. Each item asks teachers
to indicate the frequency of children’s behaviors from 0
(never) to 3 (always). We examined seven subscales repre-
senting positive behaviors: Communication, Cooperation,
Assertion, Responsibility, Empathy, Engagement, and Self-
Control; and four subscales representing behavior prob-
lem domains: Externalizing, Bullying, Hyperactivity/In-
attention, and Internalizing. Sample items of positive
behaviors include “follows classroom rules” and “expresses
feelings when wronged” and “makes a compromise during
a conflict.” Sample behavior problem items include “dis-
obeys rules or requests”, “Is aggressive toward people or ob-
jects”, and “acts without thinking”.
Our preliminary analyses indicated similar associations
between flame retardants and the three subscales of exter-
nalizing behavior problems (externalizing, hyperactivity/in-
attention, and bullying). Subsequently, we utilized an
aggregate of these three subscales in the final analyses. Pre-
liminary analyses suggested, however, that the subscales of
positive behaviors were associated differently to PBDEs and
OPFRs. Thus, each of the individual subscales of positive
behaviors were examined in the final analyses. Internal con-
sistencies for the subscales ranged from .81 for assertion to
.93 for self-control and the externalizing aggregate.
Flame retardant exposure
The methodology and results for the detection of flame
retardants in silicone passive sampling devices utilized
in this study have been published elsewhere [34]. Briefly,
silicone wristbands were purchased from a commercial
retailer (24hourwristbands.com) and prepared following
the method described in O’Connell et al. [39]. The
solvent-cleaned wristbands were then packaged in clean,
air-tight PTFE bags along with a chain of custody tag
and given to parents along with instructions to have the
child wear the wristband at all time for 7 days either as
a bracelet or anklet. Parents were instructed to place
the wristband on a table near the child’s bed if he/she
did not want to wear the wristband while sleeping. Par-
ents were then requested to re-seal the wristband in its
PTFE bag, fill in the chain of custody tag with the num-
ber of days the wristband was worn by the child, and
mail it back to Oregon State University using the pro-
vided pre-paid business envelope. The wristbands were
then extracted and analyzed for 41 different flame re-
tardant compounds using gas chromatography mass
spectrophotometry.
This analysis focused on 11 compounds (PBDE-47,
PBDE-99, PBDE-153, PBDE-154, PBDE-49, PBDE28 + 33,
tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate], TPP [e.g. triphenyl-
phosphate], TCPP [e.g tris(1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate],
and TCEP [e.g. tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate) which were
detected in 60% or more of the wristbands. For com-
pounds that were measured below the limits of detection,
a value was assigned which was equivalent to the LOD di-
vided by the square root of 2. The concentration of the
chemical detected in the wristband was then divided by
the number of days the wristband was reported to be
worn which resulted in a unit of nanograms per gram sili-
cone per day (ng/g-day). All the calibration standards were
within 15% of the true value for all compounds on 12 sep-
arate days indicating good instrument performance. Infor-
mation describing the limit of detection and quality
control measurements for these samples has been de-
scribed in detail elsewhere [34].
Congeners in the same class (e.g. 4 BFRs and 7 OPFRs)
were highly correlated with each other (ρspearman > 0.40).
Thus, we created a sum score for the different flame re-
tardant classes and used this as our exposure index. Sub-
sequently,
PBDEs is the total amount of PBDE-47,
PBDE-99, PBDE-153, PBDE-154, PBDE-49, and PBDE28
+ 33; whereas
OPFRs is the total amount of TDCPP
[e.g. tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate], TPP [e.g. tri-
phenylphosphate], TCPP [e.g tris(1-chloro-2-propyl) phos-
phate], and TCEP [e.g. tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate].
Covariates
The primary caregiver of the
child was asked to
complete several structured questionnaires to collect in-
formation about socio-demographics and aspects of the
home environment. Six variables were aggregated into a
covariate to represent the family context: maternal edu-
cation, paternal education, maternal employment, pater-
nal employment, household income, and home learning
environment. Parents reported their total years of educa-
tion (e.g. 12 = completed high school; 16 = 4-yr college
degree, etc.). Parents who reported that they were
employed either part- or full-time were coded as “1”;
others were coded as “0” for not employed. Annual
household income was reported on a scale from 1 = less
than 22,000 to 8 = 70,001 or more. The home learning
environment was measured with 14 items from the Par-
enting Questionnaire [40] related to literacy and numer-
acy activities in the household (e.g. how often do you
read to your child? How often do you encourage your
child to do math-related activities?). Items were stan-
dardized and aggregated into a home learning composite
(Cronbach’s alpha = 0.83). Values for all six variables
were standardized and averaged (Cronbach’s alpha =
0.74). Previous research has documented similar internal
reliabilities for the Parenting Questionnaire [40, 41].

 Parents were also asked to self-report if their child had
ever experienced any of the four following adverse expe-
riences since birth: lived with an adult that had problems
with alcohol or drugs or substance abuse, lived with an
adult that was depressed or mentally ill, or attempted
suicide, experienced violence or trauma (physical, psy-
chological, or sexual abuse) or neglect, witnessed domes-
tic violence. The total number of items children were
reported to have experienced was summed into an ad-
verse experience covariate (range: 0 to 4).
Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics were used to explore the data and
calculate averages, spearman correlations, and percen-
tiles of selected characteristics. The distributions of
ΣBDE and ΣOPFRs were right skewed and subsequently
natural log transformed. We then analyzed the data in
two steps. First, we conducted multiple regression ana-
lysis to test for linear associations between levels of
lnΣBDE or lnΣOPFR and subscales of social behaviors
using Mplus version 6.0 with full information maximum
likelihood estimation (FIML) [42]. These models were
adjusted for children’s age, gender, flame retardant ex-
posure, and family context. While the two flame retard-
ant exposure variables were modestly correlated (ρ =
0.24) including both exposures in the model did not in-
flate standard errors by more than 5%. We then utilized
generalized additive models (GAM) to explore non-
linear associations between lnΣBDE or lnΣOPFR and
subscales of social behaviors using R version 3.3 [43].
The upper limit on the degrees of freedom was set at k-
1 to relax any assumptions about the shape of the
exposure-response curve. Finally, all models were run
with and without the flame retardant exposure variable
to examine the proportion of variance explained by the
chemical exposure.
Results
Ninety-two children were recruited from 28 preschool
classrooms in two geographic areas of Oregon (30%
from site 1 and 70% from site 2). Descriptive statistics of

programs, a federal program in the U.S. that promotes
school readiness for children living in poverty, and 79%
attended community-based preschools. The racial/ethnic
makeup of the sample was 79.3% White, 17.3% Non-
white (5.4% African American, 7.6% Hispanic/Latino,
2.2% Asian, 1.1% Middle Eastern and 1.1% Native
American), and 4.3% unknown race/ethnicity. Overall,
this sample had similar proportions of low (34.8% com-
pleting High school/GED) and high (30.4% completing a
doctorate degree (PhD, MD, JD)) levels of maternal edu-
cation. Additionally, 3.3% of mothers completed an
Associate’s degree, 22.8% completed a 4-year Baccalaur-
eate degree, 1.1% completed a Master’s degree, and 7.6%
declined to answer. The high rates of mothers with doc-
torate degrees is likely due to the fact that our recruit-
ment sites occurred in small towns with universities.
There were no significant differences in characteristics
between those who did (n = 77) and did not (n = 15) re-
turn their wristbands to the lab for analysis.
Bivariate analysis revealed modest correlations be-
tween flame retardant exposure and some of the social
behavior subscales (Table 2). We then used multiple
regression analyses to further examine the association
between flame retardant levels and social behavior sub-
scales. We observed an association between flame re-
tardant exposure and two of the positive social skills
subscales, as well as the aggregate of externalizing be-
havior problems, controlling for child age, gender, family
context, and adverse experiences (Table 3). More specif-
ically, lnΣBDE levels were associated with less assertive
behavior, as rated by preschool teachers (β = −0.31, p <

 0.001), whereas lnΣOPFR levels were associated with
both less responsibility (β = −0.25, p < 0.001) and more
externalizing problems (β = 0.31, p < 0.05) after adjusting
for gender, age, family context, and exposure to adverse
health experiences. Interestingly, the magnitude of the
effect between OPFR exposure and externalizing behav-
ior was only slightly smaller than that of adverse experi-
ences (β = 0.42, p < 0.001). Additionally, the magnitude
of the effect between OPFR exposure and responsible
behavior were similar, albeit in the opposite direction, of
the association between the family context composite
variable, which includes the home learning environment,
and responsibility (β = 0.27, p < 0.001).
Generalized additive models were also used to examine
the associations between flame retardant exposure and
children’s social behaviors to examine the potential for
non-linear exposure-responses (Fig. 1). This approach
showed a positive, linear relationship between lnΣOPFR
levels and children’s externalizing behaviors which ex-
plained 34.8% of the observed deviance controlling for
child age, gender, family context, and adverse experiences
(Fig. 1a, p-value = 0.03). We re-ran this model without
lnΣOPFR to examine the proportion of the deviance ex-
plained by this exposure and noted that the adjusted R2
decreased to 29.4%. The exposure-response relationship
between lnΣOPFR and responsible behavior was non-
linear with the strongest effect among those children with
the highest OPFR exposures (Fig. 1c, p-value = 0.07) after
adjusting for covariates. The model which included
lnΣOPFR explained 47.8% of the observed deviance,
whereas the same model that did not include OPFRs
decreased to 38.3%. No associations were observed be-
tween lnΣBDE levels and externalizing behavior (Fig. 1b,
p-value = 0.30) or responsibility, as rated by preschool
teachers (Fig. 1d, p-value = 0.24). However, a fairly linear
association was observed between lnΣBDE levels and
assertiveness, which appeared to plateau at the highest ex-
posure levels after adjusting for age, gender, family context
and adverse experience (Fig. 1f, p-value = 0.007). This
model explained 46.6% of the observed deviance, whereas
running the same model without lnΣBDE resulted in an
observed deviance of 34.5%. Yet, no association was ob-
served between lnΣOPFR levels and teachers’ ratings of
children’s assertive behavior (Fig. 1e, p-value = 0.12).
Discussion
Our findings indicated only modest associations be-
tween levels of exposure to PBDEs and OPFRs among
preschool-aged children. This begs the question of
whether one of these two families of flame retardants
puts children at greater risk of developmental difficul-
ties, such as with social behavior. The current study
presents initial evidence that PBDEs and OPFRs relate
to children’s development in different ways. In the
current study OPFRs were predictive of more external-
izing behavior problems, including aggression, defi-
ance, hyperactivity, inattention, and bullying, as rated
by children’s preschool teachers. The effect size for the
association between exposure to flame retardants and
these social skills were modest, but was similar in mag-
nitude to the effect sizes for gender and family context,
which are well-established predictors of externalizing
problem behaviors [44, 45]. In the current study, only
children’s early adverse experiences (e.g. abuse, neg-
lect, parent mental illness/substance use) predicted ex-
ternalizing behavior more strongly than OPFR levels.
Children with higher OPFR levels were also rated by
their preschool teachers as less responsible than chil-
dren with lower OPFR levels, controlling for PBDE
levels and covariates. The size of this association was

 modest; it was similar to the effect size for family con-
text, but smaller than the effect sizes for child age and
gender. Children with higher PBDE levels, on the other
hand, were rated by their preschool teachers to be less
assertive than were children with lower PBDE levels. It
is notable that flame retardants were found to be
linked with both more negative and less positive social
behavior. Collectively this represents substantial risk
for difficulty with academics, social relationships, and
mental health [3, 4, 6, 7].
While our study employed a novel exposure assessment
technology to measure personal exposure to flame retar-
dants in early childhood [34] and was cross-sectional, our
results are consistent with other larger prospective epi-
demiological studies that have observed an association be-
tween prenatal or early life BDE exposure and behavior in
young children. For instance, Adgent et al. examined the
association between exposure to PBDEs in breast milk at
3 months of age, an important route of exposure to these
lipophilic compounds, and behaviors at 36 months of age

 using the Behavior Assessment System for Children, 2nd
edition [22]. This study reported that U.S. children with the
highest exposure to PBDEs had higher levels of anxiety
which is considered an internalizing problem. Another
study examined the association between PBDEs in maternal
blood collected during pregnancy and the child’s blood at
age 9 and a suite of behavioral and cognitive outcomes
measured at age 9 and 12 [29]. This study observed a sig-
nificant association between higher PBDE levels and atten-
tion as measured by the Conners’ Continuous Performance
Test II, processing speed as measured by the Weschler
Intelligence Scales for Children, and executive function
scores as measured by the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test
and Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function. An-
other prospective study conducted in the US examined the
association between PBDE levels in maternal blood col-
lected during pregnancy and behaviors in children at age 5
to 8 years using the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive
Function [31]. This study observed that higher maternal
serum PBDE levels were associated with poorer behavior
regulation index scores. While the overall pattern of associ-
ation between higher PBDE concentrations and poorer be-
havioral skills was observed in all of these studies including
ours, the observed effect sizes for different PBDE congeners
often differed in both magnitude and strength. These differ-
ences are likely due to differences in the study design and
their ability to capture important biological and toxico-
logical parameters such as the timing of exposures, com-
position of the chemical exposures, dose and duration of
exposure, as well as the child’s age at the time of behavioral
assessment. Another important difference is that the larger
prospective cohorts were able to capture important critical
windows of early neurodevelopment and utilized bio-
markers of exposure which reduces the potential for
misclassification.
Our study had several strengths, namely the use of the
silicone passive sampler allowed us to measure children’s
personal exposure to a mixture of flame retardants. This
mixture included organophosphate-based flame retar-
dants which have been rarely studied to date. Addition-
ally, this sampler assessed exposure from wherever the
children spent time and reflects both dermal and inhal-
ation pathways. While the silicone passive sampler pro-
vides a measure of external exposures, validation studies
show that the concentration of two OPFRs (TDCIPP
and TCIPP) measured in the sampler were strongly cor-
related with their corresponding urinary metabolites
(BDCIPP, ρ2
spearman = 0.59; and BCIPHIPP ρ2
spearman =
0.62) [46]. This suggests that the silicone wristband cap-
tures personal exposures over a short 5-day period.
However, the silicone wristbands do not capture expo-
sures from ingestion and would only reflect the expo-
sures patterns present while it was being worn. This is a
limitation to our study because our exposure assessment
likely only captures children’s current flame retardant
exposures which may differ from those experienced in
utero or during other critical windows of development.
Additionally, the exposures captured in the wristband
would not reflect internal dose which can be measured
in blood or urine. Thus, future studies should attempt to
validate these findings using biological measurements of
exposure. Our study also had other limitations including
a cross-sectional design, a small sample size, and limited
race/ethnic diversity, and high parent education levels.
There is the potential that the limited diversity and/or
high levels of parent education biased the associations
between flame retardants and children’s developmental
outcomes. For example, if a high level of parental educa-
tion buffers children from deleterious effects of flame re-
tardants on their development. Future research should
examine potentially interactive effects between family
characteristics such as parent education and flame retar-
dants on children’s development. The use of teacher rat-
ings of children’s social behaviors is also a limitation
because ratings are not as objective as direct assess-
ments, yet teacher ratings are also advantageous because
they reliably capture variation in children’s behavior in
classroom contexts that predicts their later success
[47, 48]. Also, the seven subsets of positive behavior
skills are strongly correlated, which is why we mod-
eled them separately. However, this does introduce
the potential for false positive results due to multiple
comparisons. While this is a legitimate concern, the
relationship between PBDEs and assertion, as well as
OPFRs and responsibility remained statistically signifi-
cant using a bonferroni correction (α = 0.05/7). Also,
we obtained similar associations when modeling the
data using GAMs.
Conclusion
Children are exposed to different types of flame retar-
dants from the built environment. These exposures
have been associated with poorer attention and motor
skills in children but less is known about how these
compounds are related to children’s social skills. After
controlling for social experiences and other factors,
children with higher organophosphate flame retardant
exposure were rated by their preschool teachers to
show less responsible behavior and more externalizing
behavior problems. Children with higher exposure to
brominated flame retardants were rated by their pre-
school teachers as less assertive.
