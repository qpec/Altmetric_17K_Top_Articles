While previous research has established that virtual reality (VR) can be successfully used
in the treatment of anxiety disorders, including phobias and PTSD, no research has
examined changes in brain patterns associated with the use of VR for generalized
anxiety management. In the current study, we compared a brief nature-based
mindfulness VR experience to a resting control condition on anxious participants.
Self-reported anxiety symptoms and resting-state EEG were recorded across intervals
containing quiet rest or the VR intervention. EEG activity was analyzed as a function of
global power shifts in Alpha and Beta activity, and with sLORETA current source density
estimates of cingulate cortex regions of interest. Results demonstrated that both a quiet
rest control condition and the VR meditation significantly reduced subjective reports of
anxiety and increased Alpha power. However, the VR intervention uniquely resulted in
shifting proportional power from higher Beta frequencies into lower Beta frequencies,
and significantly reduced broadband Beta activity in the anterior cingulate cortex. These
effects are consistent with a physiological reduction of anxiety. This pilot study provides
preliminary evidence supporting the therapeutic potential of VR for anxiety management
and stress reduction programs.

INTRODUCTION
Anxiety disorders are the most common mental health disorder in the United States. Prevalence
estimates from population-based surveys indicate that as much as 1/3 of the population has
experienced an anxiety disorder during their lifetime (Bandelow and Michaelis, 2015), resulting
in significant loss of productivity, health consequences, and emotional distress (Kessler et al., 2005;
Stein et al., 2005; Sareen et al., 2006; Saarni et al., 2007; Bandelow and Michaelis, 2015). Standard
treatment options include pharmacotherapy and cognitive-behavioral therapy. While there is good
evidence for both of these interventions (Roy-Byrne and Cowley, 2002; Butler et al., 2006; Norton
and Price, 2007), it is also clear that only a fraction of those identified as having a diagnosable
anxiety disorder receive sufficient treatment (Stein et al., 2011). In addition, there are large
numbers of people suffering with undiagnosed anxiety. For example, in a review of epidemiological
studies with a total of 48,214 participants, it was found that the prevalence for subthreshold
generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) was twice that for the full syndrome (Haller et al., 2014).
Studies also indicate that subthreshold GAD tends to be persistent and results in significantly more

While
cognitive-behavioral
therapies
(CBT)
have
been
identified as the treatment of choice for GAD, many successful
CBT protocols include relaxation training as a central component
(Tyrer and Baldwin, 2006). In fact, applied relaxation techniques
have been shown to have comparable effects to CBT in short
term studies (Siev and Chambless, 2007; Cuijpers et al., 2014).
Therapeutic approaches that incorporate mindfulness training
also appear to show promise as a treatment for GAD (Wetherell
et al., 2011; Hoge et al., 2013).
Given the number of people affected, it seems a logical step
to explore the potential of accessible, user-friendly, engaging
technologies to assist in this treatment process. This seems
particularly relevant for the teaching and provision of applied
relaxation and/or mindfulness interventions. Recent evidence
suggests that immersive technologies, such as virtual reality (VR),
when applied in a specific therapeutic context may an appropriate
candidate for this exploration (Maples-Keller et al., 2017).
A review of VR research shows that this modality has been
successfully used in the treatment of a variety of anxiety disorders,
including phobias and PTSD (Motraghi et al., 2014; Morina
et al., 2015). These therapeutic applications have been conducted
in the context of an ongoing therapeutic relationship using
scenes created in a VR environment, thus becoming sophisticated
additions to the traditional model of exposure therapy. In
part, the success of these programs appears to be based on
the understanding that immersive environments, such as those
provided in VR, can generate strong feelings of “
presence”
(Waterworth et al., 2010; Riva et al., 2011; Riva and Waterworth,
2014; Waterworth and Riva, 2014). “
Presence,”in this context, is
defined as the subjective feeling of being in another place and
is a crucial element in exposure-based therapies. Because VR
is immersive, it should not be surprising that this format can
provide more presence than 2-dimensional scenes. For example,
one recent study found that 360-degree video generated more
intense feelings of awe than standard 2-dimensional videos
(Chirico et al., 2017).
While our understanding of immersive technologies in the
treatment of some anxiety disorders is advancing, only one study
to date has explored the use of VR in the treatment of Generalized
Anxiety Disorders (GAD). Gorini et al. (2010) compared the
impact of using VR with biofeedback, VR without biofeedback,
and a wait list control group as an intervention for persons
diagnosed with GAD. The VR experiences used in this study were
combined with additional therapeutic techniques over the course
of 8 weeks. The VR experience itself involved the client exploring
a tropical island leading to either a campfire, beach, or waterfall.
The experience included an audio narrative of a progressive
muscle relaxation technique and/or autogenic techniques. The
biofeedback group was able to use heart rate measurements to
influence fire intensity, or movement of water. Clients were
provided with a simplified version of the experiences using a
mobile phone for home practice (Gorini et al., 2010). Pre–
post
analyses indicated that both experimental groups demonstrated
improved clinical outcomes at the end of the treatment period.
Physiological measures indicated a tendency toward decreased
heart rate and galvanic skin response between the pre- and
post-session measurements with the biofeedback group showing
slightly larger improvements.
While this study suggests that VR may be a useful tool in the
treatment of GAD, it had significant limitations. The sample size
of this study was quite small, with one of the treatment groups
only having four participants, thus limiting confidence in the
results. Additionally, this study included numerous uncontrolled
variables, making it difficult to know which aspects of the VR
or VR plus biofeedback experience were related to the results.
For example, participants focused on various aspects of the VR
experience every 2 sessions, making it difficult to know which
elements were most effective. In short, much more research is
needed in this area.
To examine the potential use of VR as an accessible
intervention for generalized anxiety, we thought it was important
to examine the impact of a single exposure on anxiety levels. In
this study, we examined the impact of a VR experience designed
by StoryUp VR which includes several components designed to
decrease anxiety. Specifically, the design elements were created
based on previous research indicating that both exposure to
nature, and mindfulness practices can aid in relaxation and
anxiety reduction.
Gorini et al. (2010) used a nature-based VR experience
in their study of GAD and obtained positive results. This is
consistent with research showing that exposure to nature reliably
reduces the stress response. This finding has been reported across
multiple studies and was even present when nature was presented
in the form of plants, posters, slides, videos, etc. These changes
in the stress response have been quantified through a variety of
physiological monitoring techniques including muscle tension,
skin conductance, pulse transit time, cardiac response, and
hormone levels (Berto, 2014). Studies examining EEG changes in
response to nature have demonstrated increases in cortical Alpha
amplitude (associated with a relaxation response) when viewing
slides of natural landscapes versus urban scenes (Ulrich, 1981),
when viewing plants with flowers versus pots without flowers
(Nakamura and Fujii, 1990), and when watching a green space
versus a concrete block fence (Nakamura and Fujii, 1992).
There is also growing evidence that mindfulness-based
practices can result in reduced stress and anxiety. In a review and
meta-analysis of meditation programs, Goyal et al. (2014) found
that mindfulness meditation programs demonstrated moderate
evidence as an intervention for anxiety. Perhaps because of this
understanding a recent review on the use of VR technology in
the treatment of anxiety specifically noted that incorporating
mindfulness exercises into a VR experience could be a potentially
helpful intervention in the treatment of GAD (Maples-Keller
et al., 2017).
The EEG patterns most associated with stress and anxiety
are increased fast wave activity (Beta) and decreased slow
wave activity (e.g., Alpha; Price and Budzynski, 2009; Olbrich
et al., 2011). Thompson and Thompson (2007) noted that
anxiety is generally associated with an increase of 19–
22 Hz
activity found in conjunction with a decrease of 15–
18 Hz
activity. Obsessive worry is connected to excessive Beta activity

along the midline and at electrode site Cz (Hammond, 2005b).
Using LORETA (Low Resolution Electromagnetic Tomogrophy)
analyses, Sherlin (2009) indicated that the most common pattern
associated with anxiety is excessive Beta in the anterior cingulate
or midline cortex.
As noted by Sherlin and Wyckoff (2010), it is logical to assume
that the same brain regions aroused by anxiety would show
quieting patterns during relaxation and meditation. In fact, one of
the most common forms of neurofeedback for anxiety treatment
involves Alpha training (Moore, 2000; Hammond, 2005a,b).
Increasing Alpha tends to result in subduing higher frequency
activity and cortical overexcitability across the cortex, much
the way training to increase Beta results in increases in higher
frequency cortical activation. These patterns are seen in other
research relevant to the current study. For example, increases in
Alpha power are associated with lower levels of anxiety, increased
calmness, positive affect, and a range of other autonomic changes
associated with decreased sympathetic arousal (Cahn and Polich,
2006).
Multiple studies have identified specific regions of the brain
associated with stress and anxiety. Most notably, the cingulate
gyrus is thought to play a significant role in the regulation of
nervous system arousal (Critchley et al., 2003). The cingulate
gyrus runs down the midline of the brain, immediately superior
to the corpus collosum. This region has been shown to become
activated during the experience of pain (Vogt et al., 1996),
negative emotions and memories (Maddock et al., 2003a,b), and
anxiety (Fredrikson et al., 1997; Simpson et al., 2001; Lanius
et al., 2003). To examine this region, we used sLORETA (Pascual-
Marqui, 2002) analyses to examine current source density
(CSD) estimates at the anterior and posterior cingulate as these
specific areas contribute important and distinct elements to the
experience of anxiety.
The current study investigated the impact of a mindfulness-
in-nature VR intervention on persons screened as demonstrating
moderate to high levels of generalized anxiety. Changes in
anxiety were assessed through self-report questionnaires (STAI-
state) as well as EEG patterns associated with anxiety and/or
relaxation. We employed a mixed model repeated-measure
approach, whereby EEG recordings and state anxiety ratings
were made across three time points spanning two 5-min
intervals, either containing the meditative VR experience or
5 min of awake, eyes-open rest. For the intervention group
the measurement and interval sequencing was comprised of an
initial EEG baseline, followed by rest, followed by post-rest EEG
and state anxiety measurements, followed by the interval of the
VR meditation experience, followed by a final EEG recording
and state anxiety measurement. The control group followed the
same recording procedures and intervals, with the exception that
they participated in a further interval of quiet rest, rather than
the VR meditation. We hypothesized that the meditative VR
experience, more than rest alone, would result in a significant
reduction in reported state levels of anxiety. Furthermore, we
hypothesized that such reductions in state anxiety would be
accompanied by equally significant changes in overall EEG
activity. More specifically, we anticipated a significant drop in
anxiety to be associated with a reduction in the amount of
high frequency activity in favor of power in lower frequency
ranges.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants
Participants were recruited in two separate rounds through flyers
and marketing on Facebook
R
�. The initial subject pool were all
part of the intervention group. Following preliminary analyses,
it was determined that a control group was necessary to better
interpret the results. Consequently, the same procedures were
repeated for a second group of participants that served as the
control group.
Interested participants called the researcher and completed
a phone screening consisting of exclusion/inclusion criterion
as well as a Generalized Anxiety Disorder screening (GAD-7).
Exclusion criterion included a history of head injury, seizure
activity, or major mental health concerns (schizophrenia and
bipolar disorder). To be included in the study, participants had
to be at least 18 years old with a moderate level of generalized
anxiety (score of 8 or higher on the GAD-7. Intervention
M = 12.6, SD = 3.7; Control M = 12.0, SD = 4.14). A total of
47 respondents were phone screened in the intervention group,
26 were eligible to participate and 21 completed the study.
Of the five that did not complete the study, three canceled
and two did not show for their appointments. The complete
data set of seven participants were removed due to excessive
EEG artifact or incomplete data sets due to researcher error
(N = 14). Eighteen respondents were screened for the control
group, 5 were not qualified due to GAD scores lower than 8
and one of those five had a traumatic brain injury. Of the 13
controls subjects that completed the study, one was removed
due to excessive artifact (N = 12). For demographic information

previously demonstrated an internal consistency of 0.92 and
test-retest reliability of 0.83 (Spitzer et al., 2006).
State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Y (STAI)
The STAI is a commonly used measure of trait and state anxiety.
Form Y has 20 items for assessing trait anxiety and 20 for state
anxiety. Only the state portion of the survey was used in this
study as this segment was designed to measure more immediate
symptoms of anxiety. State items include: “
I am tense;”“
I am
worried;”and “
I feel calm.”All items are rated on a 4-point scale
(e.g., from “
not at all”to “
very much so”
). Higher scores indicate
greater anxiety. Internal consistency coefficients for the scale have
ranged from 0.86 to 0.95; test–
retest reliability estimates have
ranged from 0.65 to 0.75 over a 2-month interval (Spielberger
et al., 1983).
EEG Data Collection
The EEG data in this study was sampled with 19 electrodes
in the standard 10–
20 International placement referenced to
FIGURE 1 | Experimental design. Participants were recruited to either the VR
experience group (EX) or a control group (CN). Each group underwent three
time points of measurement each consisting of 5-min eyes closed EEG
recording and filling out state anxiety questionnaire. EEG recordings were
interleaved by an initial 5 min period of eyes-open rest for both groups,
followed by either a brief 5 min VR meditation intervention (EX) or another
period of 5 min eyes-open rest (CN).

F7, F8, Fz, C3, C4, Cz, P3, P4, Pz, T3, T4, T5, T6, O1, and O2.
Figure 1 illustrates the experimental design and EEG recording
intervals. While all the rest intervals were of quiet, eyes-open rest,
the EEG-recordings were conducted during eyes-closed resting.
Five minutes of eyes-closed data resting was collected at three
recording time points for each subject: Time 1 (Baseline), Time 2
(2nd Baseline), Time 3 (Post Experimental Condition). Between
the recordings, for Time 1 and Time 2, all subjects were instructed
to sit in a state of quiet, natural, eyes-open rest (blinking allowed)
for 5-min. This served as a within-subjects control condition
for the intervention group. Each raw EEG file was uploaded to
Qeeg Pro (QEEG Professionals, The Netherlands) and processed
through a Standardized Artifact Rejection Algorithm (S.A.R.A).
This process removes segments from an EEG recording that are
likely due to other sources, such as eye blinks, muscle tension,
etc. Using an automated process such as this ensures that each
file is handled in the same manner and reduces the possibility of
bias in the artifact removal process. Raw files were then manually
inspected. 11.5% of the experimental group and 7.7% of the
control group EEG recordings were eliminated due to excessive
artifact.
Artifact-free files were then processed through BrainAvatar
software (BrainMaster Technologies, Inc.) to obtain power
estimates for the bands Alpha (8–
12 Hz), Alpha1 (8–
10 Hz)
and Alpha2 (10–
12 Hz) sub-bands, Beta (12–
30 Hz), Low
Beta (12–
18 Hz), and High Beta (18–
30 Hz) sub-bands,
and broadband activity (Sum: 1–
30 Hz) at all 19 electrode
sites. In addition, CSD estimates for the same primary EEG
bands were obtained for specific regions of interest (ROI’
s)
using the sLORETA algorithm (Pascual-Marqui, 2002) in

CSD. While the accuracy of CSD estimates increases with the
number of electrodes (Song et al., 2015), it has been shown
that with as little as 16 electrodes (Cohen et al., 1990), and
using the approximate three-shell head model provided by
the original LORETA equations, “
human in vivo localization
accuracy of EEG is 10 mm at worst”(Pascual-Marqui, 1999,
p. 11). Given that sLORETA provides higher resolution than the
previous solution (LORETA), accuracy of localization should
be improved (Pascual-Marqui, 2002) and sufficient for the
current pilot examination. The specific application utilized in
this study uses 5-mm voxels to compute 6,239 voxels which can
be combined to correspond to 88 specific brain regions (Collura,
2012).
Procedures
Importantly, for testing the VR intervention, our initial
study approach was a within-subject, rest-then-intervention,
experimental design. After more resources became available, the
participants for the control group were then recruited, screened,
and ran, allowing for within- and between-group comparisons.
However, the sequential addition of this more rigorous control
method resulted in non-random assignment to groups. Although
participants in both groups matched closely on all demographic
characteristics (see Table 1), this is still a notable procedural
limitation.
Participating subjects were scheduled for a 75-min office
visit. After a verbal description of the study process and
completing IRB information/consent forms, subjects completed
a demographic, and STAI-state questionnaire. Subjects were then
provided with a non-therapeutic VR experience to orient them to
the experience of VR. During the VR orientation, subjects were
seated in a swivel chair in the center of the research room, given
basic instruction on the VR headgear (Gear VR powered by a
Samsung Android s7 phone), and then given the opportunity
to experience a 2 min, 30 s VR event that involved being on
the field just prior to the beginning of a college football game.
Following this orientation, subjects were fitted with a 19-channel
EEG electrocap (Electrocap International, United States). Each
electrode was prepped using electrogel conductance paste
(Electro-Cap International, Inc., United States). Impedances
for all sites were assessed prior to each recording and kept
below 10 kOhms. Subjects completed a 5-min, eyes-closed EEG
baseline, recorded using a BrainMaster Discovery amplifier
(BrainMaster Technologies, Inc., United States). Following the
initial baseline recording, subjects were asked to remain seated
with eyes open and no verbal interaction for 5 min. After this
resting period, a second eyes closed baseline was recorded for
5 min and subjects were asked to complete a second STAI-state
questionnaire. This process provided a within-subject control,
allowing us to investigate whether the VR experience results in
significantly more change than might be observed simply by
time. Control group subjects repeated a second 5 min, eyes-
open resting period while experimental group subjects returned
to the swivel chair and the VR headgear was placed over the
electrocap. The subject was then instructed to simply enjoy the
mindfulness in nature VR experience and follow along with the
guided meditation.
The Mindfulness in nature experience was 5-min, 41 s
in length and produced by StoryUp VR (Columbia, MO,
United States) using 360◦ video photography. As the scene
opens, there are mountains in the distance and large rocks
all around on the landscape (see Figure 2). The sky is
blue and speckled with clouds and there is a mist rolling
in front of the mountains. There is soft piano and violin
music playing in the background. Approximately 20 s into the
experience, a woman’
s voice begins guiding the viewer through
a mindfulness meditation, directing the attention to elements of
the environment and asking them to connect with what they
are seeing by imagining that they embody the same qualities as
the rocks and sky. Near the end of the scene, an inspirational
quote attributed to Lao Tzu (i.e., “
Nature does not hurry, yet
everything is accomplished”
) is displayed and the screen slowly
dims.
At the conclusion of the second rest period (control group)
or the mindfulness-in-nature VR experience (intervention
group), the headgear was removed, impedance levels were re-
checked, and a post-VR, 5-min EEG was recorded using the
same instructions as the previous recordings. Following the
final EEG recording, subjects completed a post-VR STAI-state
form questionnaire. All subjects completing the study were
incentivized for their participation with a $25 gift card.
Data Analysis
Both mean power and power band ratios from the average of all
19 electrodes were used to test hypotheses about global spectral
state changes across time points. As a pilot study our primary
aim was to capture the spectral changes broadly and not tightly
coupled to topographical restrictions. We anticipated the whole
scalp average approach would be able to capture the predicted
changes in the Alpha and Beta bands, and also limit the number of
statistical comparisons employed to test our hypotheses. As part
of our analyses we also aimed to analyze relative spectral power
shifts in participant EEG profiles between power bands, so simple
power ratios were also calculated from the total electrode power
means. Ratios of interest included each band and sub-band power
over Sum power (1–
30 Hz) as well as Alpha/Beta, Alpha1/Alpha2,
and Low-Beta/High-Beta.
For increased specificity, we divided Alpha (8–
12 Hz) and
Beta (12–
30 Hz) into two sub-components. Alpha1 (8–
10 Hz),
sometimes referred to as “
Low Alpha,” is associated with a
calm and relaxing state in which we are not attending to the
external world (Thompson and Thompson, 2003). In contrast,
Alpha2 (10–
12 Hz), sometimes referred to as “
High Alpha,”
is related to a state of relaxed alertness, such as might be
observed just prior to engaging in an action (Thompson and
Thompson, 2003). The lower end of Beta (12–
18 Hz) activity
has been implicated in, and emerging from, the undertaking
challenging cognitive tasks (Sherlin, 2009). It has also been
associated with the maintenance of cognitive, psychological, and
behavioral processes, with pathological elevations in Beta activity
potentially linked to states of cognitive inflexibility (Engel and
Fries, 2010). High Beta (18–
30 Hz) is most often associated
with higher levels of concentration, but is also observed at
increased levels during anxiety or periods of emotional intensity

Our inclusion of sLORETA ROIs for analysis was also
restricted for minimum variable inclusion. We limited the
analyses to two ROIs: the Posterior Cingulate Cortex (PCC), a
major hub of the default mode network (Shulman et al., 1997;
Raichle et al., 2001), and the Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC),
an area associated with cognitive and emotional processing (Bush
et al., 2000; Holroyd and Coles, 2002; Mansouri et al., 2009).
Both regions have also been associated with state changes during,
and as a result of meditative experiences (Holzel et al., 2011; van
Lutterveld et al., 2016).
Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS software (SPSS
v21; IBM Inc., Armonk, NY, United States). A series of 2 × 3
(Group × Time) mixed model repeated measure ANOVAs were
computed for each EEG frequency band of interest, for both
mean power and band power ratios. EEG activity was computed
across all 19 electrode sites to incorporate the most EEG data
as possible and evaluate changes at the broadest scale. Similarly,
2 × 3 (Group × Time) mixed-model repeated-measure ANOVAs
were also used to analyze the sLORETA estimated current source
densities of ACC and PCC activity in the Theta, Alpha and Beta
range. However, here we limited analyses to the broad band
level (i.e., Theta, Alpha, Beta), and did not include sub-band
computations. Huynh–
Feldt corrections to degrees of freedom
were applied when violations to variable sphericity across time
points were detected. The threshold for evaluating significance
was set to α = 0.05. Follow-up one-way ANOVAs were conducted
when group or interaction differences were detected, followed
by pairwise comparisons, Bonferroni corrected for multiple
comparisons.
Of the 34 total participants, two participant’
s data (one from
each group) was removed because of high levels of artifact EEG
contamination across all time points. In addition, 6 subjects were
missing at least some data in a specific recording condition. For
the final analyses, only the subjects with full data sets were used.
Thus, the final sample (N = 26) was comprised of 14 participants
in the VR group and 12 participants in the control group.
RESULTS
Demographic
Control group data was collected after intervention group data
due to previously noted constraints. Because these circumstances
precluded random assignment between groups, we attempted
to match the subsequent control group to the screening
and demographic characteristics of the previously collected
intervention
group.
Statistical
analyses
with
independent
t-testing, revealed no statistical differences in terms of age, years
of education, GAD, or meditation experience. Table 1 reveals the
comparability between groups across all demographic variables.
State-Trait Anxiety Inventory
To evaluate subject reports of state stress levels across time points,
mean STAI scores were analyzed using a repeated-measures 2 × 3
(Group × Time) ANOVA. A significant main effect for Time was
observed, F1.4,32.7 = 35.54, p < 0.001, η2
p = 0.60, with no between
Group or interaction effects (Group: F1,24 = 1.72, p = 0.202,
η2
p = 0.07; Group × Time: F1.4,32.7 = 0.54, p = 0.522, η2
p = 0.02).
State stress ratings linearly declined across each interval for both
groups, regardless of whether intervals contained rest or the

intervention. Means and standard errors across time points for
STAI respective to group, and all other dependent variables are
contained in Table 2.
Mean Power
To evaluate the electrophysiological markers of cognitive state
change across intervals we first analyzed the mean power from
all electrode sites for each frequency band of interest. Alpha
(F2,48 = 7.06, p = 0.002, η2
p = 0.23) and Beta (F2,48 = 5.84,
p = 0.005, η2
p = 0.20) demonstrated a significant main effect for
time, with both groups demonstrating slight linear increases in
power across intervals. When both Alpha and Beta were broken
down into their sub-bands for increased resolution both Alpha1
(F2,48 = 6.11, p = 0.004, η2
p = 0.20) and Alpha2 (F2,48 = 5.75,
p = 0.006, η2
p = 0.004), as well as Low Beta (F2,48 = 8.92, p = 0.001,
η2
p = 0.26), but not High Beta (F2,48 = 2.59, p = 0.085, η2
p = 0.098),
revealed significant main effect for time. Across intervals, Alpha1
power increased for both groups, but more so for the intervention
group after VR. In contrast, for both groups across rest Alpha2
power shows a small increase, which continues after the second
period of rest for the control group, but demonstrates a slight
decrease after the VR experience for the intervention group.
Group means and standard errors of mean power for each group
can be seen in Table 2, and reveal comparable linear decreases
across all intervals for both groups.
No significant time by group interactions were observed
for Alpha, Beta, or the respective sub-band activity of each.
However, a significant main effect of group difference was
observed for both Alpha (F1,24 = 4.76, p = 0.039, η2
p = 0.17)
and Low Beta (F1,24 = 5.21, p = 0.032, η2
p = 0.18), to the
effect that on average the intervention group had higher power
than the control group. Closer investigation of these differences
with follow-up one-way ANOVAs at each time point revealed
for Alpha initially the intervention and control groups were
statistically comparable (T1: F1,25 = 3.97, p = 0.058), before
becoming increasingly different across subsequent intervals (T2:
F1,25 = 4.94, p = 0.036; T3: F1,25 = 5.14, p = 0.033). Low
Beta was found to be initially significantly higher for the
intervention group (T1: F1,25 = 4.96, p = 0.036; T2: F1,25 = 4.72,
p = 0.040), and similarly to Alpha, was most different between
groups at the last recording time (T3: F1,25 = 5.74, p = 0.025).
In both cases, the intervention group started with higher
average Alpha and Low-Beta spectral power, with the pattern
of results showing further power increases particularly for the
intervention group after the VR meditation experience (Alpha:
T1−2 M±SE = −0.027±.125, p = 0.998, T2−3 M± SE = −0.264±.147,
p = 0.302; Low Beta: T1−2 M ± SE = −0.114±0.083, p = 0.582,
T2−3 M ± SE = −0.232±0.073, p = 0.021) compared to the control
group after their second period of quiet rest (Control Alpha: T1−2
M±SE = −0.341±0.207, p = 0.369, T2−3 M±SE = −0.240±.111,
p = 0.149; Low Beta: T1−2 M±SE = −0.070±0.035, p = 0.205,
T2−3 M±SE = −0.047±0.052, p = 0.137). This difference likely
contributed to the overall group difference effect found in Alpha
and Low Beta revealed by the initial omnibus ANOVA.
Together these results reveal significant increases in Alpha
and Beta power over the study duration, with the power in the
lower, but not higher, Alpha and Beta sub-bands demonstrating
slightly higher power increases on average specifically after the
VR intervention as opposed to rest.
Power Ratios
To further investigate spectral power shifts from the perspective
of relative power changes, we converted the mean power into
ratio form for comparison. We looked at the specific power
dynamic changes on the backdrop of global power (i.e., Sum; 1–
30 Hz), as well as between specific band and sub-band frequency
ranges. A significant main effect for time was observed for
Alpha/Sum (F2,48 = 4.57, p = 0.015, η2
p = 0.16), and Alpha/Beta
(F2,48 = 5.26, p = 0.009, η2
p = 0.18), but not Beta/Sum (F2,48 = 0.67,
p = 0.523, η2
p = 0.03). Overall alpha increased in proportional
power over Sum and Beta activity over the course of the
experiment for both groups, whereas Beta/Sum tended toward a
slight, non-significant decrease across the experimental intervals.
Ratio means for band and sub-band dynamics can be viewed in
Table 3. No significant group differences or interaction effects
were observed for Alpha/Sum, Alpha/Beta, or Beta/Sum.
At sub-band resolution, Alpha1/Sum (F2,48 = 4.00, p = 0.025,
η2
p = 0.14), High-Beta/Sum (F2,48 = 5.81, p = 0.009, η2
p = 0.18),
High-Beta/Alpha (F2,48
= 9.24, p < 0.001, η2
p
= 0.28),
Low-Beta/Alpha (F2,48 = 5.34, p = 0.008, η2
p = 0.18), and
Low-Beta/High-Beta (F2,48 = 13.20, p < 0.001, η2
p = 0.36)
all revealed significant main effects across time, with no
significant differences between groups. Overall, particular to
the second interval, and irrespective of group, Alpha1/Sum
significantly increased (T2−3 M±SE = −0.025±0.009, p = 0.031),
whereas Low-Beta/Alpha (T2−3 M±SE = 0.031±0.011, p = 0.028)
and High-Beta/Alpha (T2−3 M±SE = 0.053±0.014, p = 0.002)
decreased. High-Beta/Sum (T1−3 M±SE = 0.011±0.003, p = 0.009)
demonstrated a slight linear decrease across the experiment,
more pronounced for the intervention group after the VR
experience. Alpha2/Sum (F2,48 = 2.49, p = 0.093, η2
p = 0.09), Low-
Beta/Sum (F2,48 = 0.42, p = 0.660, η2
p = 0.02), Alpha1/Alpha2
(F2,48 = 1.00, p = 0.375, η2
p = 0.04) did not change significantly
across time, or differ significantly between groups. Figure 3
shows the relative sub-band power dynamics across intervals, by
group.
Notably, a significant interaction was observed for Low-
Beta/High-Beta (F2,48 = 3.71, p = 0.032, η2
p = 0.13). Follow-up
ANOVA tests revealed that across the first two recording time
points, interleaved by a period of rest for both groups, each
group’
s Low-Beta/High-Beta power was statistically comparable
(T1: F1,25 = 4.15, p = 0.053; T2: F1,25 = 3.14, p = 0.089). However,
at the last recording, a significant difference was observed (T3:
F1,25 = 4.15, p = 0.040). Looking at the within group patterns for
the intervention group, there was no significant change in Low-
Beta/High-Beta across the rest interval (T1−2 M±SE = 0.007±.010,
p = 0.998), and the significant change only occured after the VR
meditation experience (T2−3 M±SE = −0.054±.014, p = 0.005).
This pattern was not observed across either of rest intervals
for the control group (T1−2 M±SE = −0.011±0.008, p = 0.578;
T2−3 M±SE = −0.012±0.008, p = 0.463). Figure 3F, illustrates this

sLORETA
Next, we wanted to investigate specific anterior and posterior
cortical regions of interest for changes in regional activity
across spectral bands. Specifically, we investigated current source
densities in the ACC and PCC for Theta, Alpha, and Beta
frequencies. In the ACC, a significant main effect for time was
found for Beta (F2,48 = 3.01, p = 0.054, η2
p = 0.11) but not Theta
(F2,48 = 0.41, p = 0.664, η2
p = 0.02) or Alpha (F2,48 = 0.47,
p = 0.649, η2
p = 0.02). There was no between group main effect
for ACC activity, and Theta and Alpha appeared to be quite
stable across intervals for both the experimental and control
groups across intervals. However, a significant Time by Group
interaction emerged for ACC Beta activity (F2,48 = 3.52, p = 0.038,
η2
p = 0.13). Follow-up repeated measures by group indicated
no significant change across rest for the experimental group
(T1−2 M±SE = −0.122±0.105, p = 0.795), followed by a significant
decrease in ACC Beta activity following the VR intervention
(T2−3 M±SE = 0.341±0.010, p = 0.048). The control group did not
demonstrate a significant change across either rest interval (T1−2
M±SE = −0.090±0.042, p = 0.171; T2−3 M±SE = 0.005±0.098,
p = 0.998). Alpha and Beta ACC activity between groups can be
found in Figure 4.
For the PCC, significant main effects for time were found
for Alpha (F2,48 = 4.42, p = 0.017, η2
p = 0.16) and Beta
(F2,48 = 5.61, p = 0.006, η2
p = 0.19), but not Theta (F1.7,41.8 = 2.44,
p = 0.106, η2
p = 0.09). Significant increases, irrespective of group
and interval, were only observed comparing between the first
and last time points (PCC Alpha: T1−3 M±SE = −0.228±0.086,
p = 0.042; PCC Beta: T1−3 M±SE = −0.122±0.039, p = 0.015).
The experimental group demonstrated consistently higher
PCC current source densities than the control group (Alpha:
F1,24 = 4.47, p = 0.045, η2
p = 0.16; Beta: F1,24 = 4.32, p = 0.049,
η2
p = 0.15), but both groups demonstrated the same small pattern
of linear CSD increase over time.
Together these results reveal a significant specific effect on
ACC Beta activity occurring after the VR experience, but not
after rest alone. Alpha activity was uniformly higher in PCC
for the VR group across all intervals, demonstrating similar
incremental increases across the VR interval as rest. It is unclear
what accounts for the group differences in PCC Alpha, however,

it does not appear to be directly related to undergoing the VR
meditation experience.
Correlations
To further quantify the relationship between self-reported
anxiety and changes in electrophysiological profiles we conducted
correlational analyses examining both STAI and GAD scores
in relation to our EEG power ratio and source localization
data (N = 26 for correlational analyses). GAD scores were
significantly inversely correlated with Alpha/Sum across all time
points (T1, r = −0.47, p = 0.019; T2, r = −0.35, p = 0.080; T3,
r = −0.43, p = 0.027). At the sub-band level it was discovered
that there was a proportional increase of slower sub-band Alpha
activity (Alpha1/Sum: T1, r = −0.46, p = 0.018; T2, r = −0.35,

p = 0.078; T3, r = −0.43, p = 0.029) but not higher Alpha sub-
band activity (Alpha2/Sum: T1−3, r’
s = −0.12 –−0.13, p’
s > 0.2)
that supported this relationship. Additionally, and perhaps more
germane to our main findings, across all time points Low-
Beta/High-Beta was similarly significantly inversely related to
GAD scores (T1, r = −0.45, p = 0.023; T2, r = −0.43, p = 0.030;
T3, r = −0.39, p = 0.048). Conversely, High-Beta/Sum activity
was significantly positively associated with GAD across all time
points (r = 0.48, p = 0.013; r = 0.45, p = 0.022; r = 0.44, p = 0.025)
whereas low Beta/Sum was not (T1−3 r’
s = 0.10 –0.12 p’
s > 0.5).
To analyze the STAI ratings, difference scores were calculated
between T2-1, T3-2, and T3-1. Difference scores were also
calculated for Alpha, Beta, and their sub-bands across a number
of variables. The only positive correlation between STAI and EEG
was between T3-2 for mean High-Beta power and higher T3-2
STAI rating (r = 0.456, p = 0.019). That is, higher High Beta
predicted higher state stress ratings, a result which seems to align
with the GAD anxiety rating results.
DISCUSSION
To our awareness, this is the first study to evaluate the
potential anxiety reducing effects of a brief VR intervention
specifically designed to help individuals with trait elevated
general anxiety. Although both our control and experimental
VR intervention groups self-reported decreasing state anxiety
across the experiment, significant objective electrophysiological
markers associated with reduced anxiety states uniquely appeared
only after the VR meditation experience, as opposed to normal
periods of rest. The VR meditation resulted in both global
and regional decreases in Beta activity. Both effects are in
line with electrophysiologically indicating a state of reduced
anxiousness. The results of this pilot study provide preliminary
evidence supporting that VR interventions may be a useful and
effective tool for the treatment of elevated anxiety symptoms.
However, the findings and interpretations of these results fall
on the background of notable study limitations. Future research
is needed to further develop and expand upon the current
level of neural mechanistic and processual understanding with
regards to how meditative VR simulations affect the brain and
mind. As well, further and more robust studies are needed
to continue testing the therapeutic efficacy of similar VR
meditations on clinical populations, and as compared to other
varieties of treatment and control conditions. Despite a number
of limitations, discussed in the subsequent sections, this pilot
study provides a liminary set of results to build upon as both
science and technology continue to advance in this burgeoning
area of applied research and intervention.
In this study, both the VR intervention and control
participants demonstrated linear decreases in subjective anxiety
across all time points. Contrary to our hypotheses, after the
VR meditation experience we did not observe a particularly
notable reduction in self-reported state anxiety, beyond what
the interval of mere quiet rest afforded. Decreases occurred
in similar magnitudes irrespective of group or whether the
preceding interval contained rest or VR. The ubiquity of this
pattern between groups, despite obvious experiential differences
between VR and rest, could be due to a number of factors. First,
is the possibility that the VR experience was indeed completely
comparable to the experience of resting. However, given that
the experience of a quiet rest is quite different from the VR
immersive experience, it is suspect that the exact same anxiety
reducing processes were underway across both intervals for
both groups. Furthermore, the current study demonstrated a
pattern of spectral changes in the intervention group which
differed in significant and important ways from the control
group, which indicates that there were indeed unique differences
in neurophysiological state brought about by the VR meditative
experience.
Alternatively, the observed pattern of STAI responses may
have been the result of other potentially strong experimental
influences such as characteristic demands (expectations to
report reduced anxiety), habituation to the testing environment,
psychometric limitations such as floor and ceiling effects, or
any combination of these factors. We tend to believe these
factors were at least partially influential on the pattern of anxiety
rating responses across the testing sessions. While incorporating
a control group allowed us to account for and mitigate the
confounding effects of some of these considerations (e.g.,
habituation), we believe that incorporating a variety of anxiety
measures in future investigations would help to better delineate
the specific magnitude and nature of subjective psychological
responses to VR interventions.
Importantly, while both groups showed comparable decreases
in self-reported state anxiety, only the VR group, after the
VR intervention, uniquely demonstrated additional physiological
changes in align with reduced hyperarousal and/or anxiety. Our
EEG analysis was focused on Alpha and Beta, and the respective
sub-bandwidths’
activity (Alpha1, Alpha2, Low-Beta, High-Beta).
The amount of EEG activity occurring across these ranges has
been linked with states of relaxation, stress, and anxiety; with
increased Alpha being broadly associated with calm and relaxed
states, and Beta, particularly higher Beta frequencies, associated
with qualitatively anxious states (Thompson and Thompson,
2007; Price and Budzynski, 2009; Olbrich et al., 2011). Our
correlational analyses seemed to support such a relationship.
GAD scores were significantly inversely correlated with the
proportion of Alpha power relative to the full spectrum power
profile (i.e., Sum). Moreover, at the sub-band level it was found
that lower Alpha frequencies (Alpha1), but not higher Alpha
frequencies (Alpha2) supported this relationship. Conversely,
High Beta activity significantly predicted higher anxiety scores on
both the GAD and the STAI, whereas Low Beta activity did not.
We
anticipated
some
degree
of
psychological
and
physiological relaxation response to emerge from a period
of quiet rest, but hypothesized that the VR experience would
result in unique significant psychophysiological effects beyond
experiencing rest alone. Specifically, we hypothesized that
we would observe power shifting from higher frequency
ranges, such as High-Beta, into lower frequency ranges, such
as Alpha. Interestingly, our results tended to indicate power
downshifts occurring within (i.e., sub-bands) - but not between
- conventional bandwidths (e.g., overall significantly reduced

Anxiety, Virtual Reality, and QEEG
broadband Beta activity coinciding with significantly increased
Alpha activity).
Indeed, the pattern of results was much more nuanced.
Looking at absolute mean power in Alpha and Beta bandwidths
revealed similar power increases across groups, with minor,
but not statistically significant divergent patterns when mean
power was evaluated within respective sub-bands across the
experimental intervals. The observed increased Alpha power
for both groups generally fits the narrative of reduced anxiety
and increased relaxation, despite no significant extra or unique
Alpha enhancement emerging from the VR intervention. Overall,
broadband Beta activity demonstrated small but significant
increases over time, irrespective of group. However, sub-
band dynamics within Beta revealed unique VR effects which
supported our general hypotheses.
A more detailed analyses comparing relative power between
EEG bands revealed a significant change in the Low-Beta/High-
Beta power ratio, specifically occurring in the VR intervention
group after the VR experience, but not after rest. While the
High Beta frequency range plateaued across the VR interval
(and actually decreased relative to total broadband power), the
lower Beta range power showed specific increases immediately
following the VR exposure. When these shifts in sub-band Beta
power were directly compared relative to one another, it was
found that the proportion of Low-Beta to High-Beta activity
shifted significantly in favor of Low-Beta activity, only for the
VR group and only after the VR experience. Although on average
the control group had a slightly lower Low-Beta/High-Beta ratio,
similar to the VR group, intervals merely involving rest had no
effect on the Low-Beta/High-Beta power dynamic.
This finding is significant, indicating a relative reduction of
global High-Beta activity only after the VR intervention. This
band is of particular interest as it is a the frequency range notably
associated with elevated stress and anxiety. In their research,
Thompson and Thompson (2007) report that anxiety is generally
associated with an increase of High-Beta found in conjunction
with a decrease of Low Beta activity; which is the exact opposite
of the pattern demonstrated by the VR group in this study.
Indeed, our correlational analyses also revealed and support the
association between elevated anxiety and High Beta activity.
Given our participants were specifically selected based on their
elevated anxiety, these shifts in power away from High-Beta are
consistent with our hypothesis of reduced anxiety as a result of
the VR experience.
Beyond
evaluating
global
electrophysiological
pattern
changes, we were also interested in select regional activity
changes. Using sLORETA, a source localization technique that
has been shown to be reasonably effective and accurate, even
with relatively low electrode densities such as here (Cohen et al.,
1990; Pascual-Marqui et al., 1994; Pascual-Marqui, 1999, 2002,
2007), we examined CSD changes in the anterior and posterior
cingulate cortices.
The ACC is thought to serve as a primary mediator
between the limbic system and the autonomic nervous system.
It is engaged during a range of tasks including decision-
making (Rushworth et al., 2007; Morecraft and Tanji, 2009;
Shackman et al., 2011), reward processing, conflict monitoring,
error detection, and the experience of pain (Vogt, 2005;
Beckmann et al., 2009; Shackman et al., 2011). Due to its role
in focusing attention, appraisal, and cognitive flexibility, it may
come as no surprise that ACC overactivity has also been linked
to stress, worry, and cognitive rigidity (Amen, 2001). Other
research also suggests ACC overarousal is linked to symptoms
of obsessive-compulsive disorder (Rauch et al., 1998; Graybiel
and Rauch, 2000). Consistent with this understanding, studies
designed to reduce anxiety using respiratory sinus arrhythmia
breathing (Sherlin and Wyckoff, 2010) and meditation (Cahn
and Polich, 2006; Fox et al., 2016) have demonstrated reduced
activation of the ACC. Consistent with these roles and intended
goal of anxiety reduction, here we observed a significant decrease
of Beta activity in the ACC in the VR but not control group,
which occurred only after the VR experience as opposed to an
equivalent time of rest. This supports the notion that the VR
intervention resulted in changes beyond that experienced by time
or quiet rest, and implicates the ACC as one specific region likely
affected by the VR meditation, in addition to, or as part of, the
global reduction in physiological arousal suggested by our other
EEG results.
The other region of interest examined was the PCC. This
region is a primary hub of the Default Mode Network (DMN), a
group of neural structures strongly linked to self-referencing and
other self-related processing (Shulman et al., 1997; Raichle et al.,
2001). Recent investigations have identified that the processing
of self-related information in the DMN is largely driven by the
PCC (Davey et al., 2016). Due to its strong role in self-referencing,
research has consistently demonstrated that overarousal of the
PCC is connected to a variety of mental health concerns,
including ADHD (Nakao et al., 2011), depression (Haznedar
et al., 2004), and rumination (Berman et al., 2011). Decreased
activity in the PCC is a common finding in meditation literature,
consistent with the notion of minimizing self-related thinking
(Baerentsen et al., 2010; Fox et al., 2016).
In the current study, we found significant group differences
sustained across all intervals, to the effect that PCC activity was
generally higher in the VR group compared to controls across
Theta, Alpha, and Beta activity ranges. It is unclear why this
difference existed. It may somehow be related to the sequential
nature of our group data collection, a notable limitation of our
study; the precise effects of which are unclear. However, both
groups, irrespective of whether the intervals contained rest or
the VR intervention, demonstrated similar increases in PCC
activation across the duration of the study. Given the broad and
non-specific nature of the PCC, it is not entirely clear what this
pattern of activity means in terms of contributing to particular
psychological or physiological effects. Tentatively, the lack of
between group differences suggests that sitting quietly compared
to engaging in this type of VR mindfulness meditation for brief
periods may have similar impacts on this particular brain region.
The PCC has been identified as a neural region involved in
self-examination and self-referential processing (Cavanna and
Trimble, 2006; Herwig et al., 2012), so it is possible that the
changes in the PCC are associated with participants repeatedly
self-reflecting on their state anxiety across the course of the
study.

Anxiety, Virtual Reality, and QEEG
Unfortunately, for this pilot, we did not formally assess
the content of the subject’
s cognitive processes during the
experimental or control conditions, instead relying on STAI
rating as indicators of cognitive state and stress levels. Despite
this limitation, a number of informal observations were made
suggesting the VR intervention was having the predicted effect.
Some of these observations in experimental group subjects
included relaxed shoulder postures and/or slowing of their
breathing pattern during the VR experience, which tended to
occur between the 2 and 3-min mark of the experience. In
addition, several experimental group subjects made spontaneous
comments after the VR experience, suggesting that they found it
to be enjoyable and/or relaxing. For example, one subject noted
“
I liked the woman’
s voice on the guided meditation. I found it
relaxing.”
Summarizing to this point, both groups showed equivalent
reductions in state anxiety across time based on subjective
ratings. As well, both groups demonstrated increased Alpha
power, a common concomitant associated with taking a period
of rest. However, a unique effect associated with the VR
experience was a global power shift from higher to lower
Beta frequencies. Given that prominent high frequency Beta
activity is a known marker of state hyperarousal and anxiety,
this finding is significant. It tends to support the notion
that the VR intervention successfully reduced an important
psychophysiological aspect of anxiety, in a way that merely taking
a resting break is not able to do.
Limitations and Future Directions
At the broadest experimental level, are some rather conspicuous
limitations. As a pilot evaluation of a newly developed VR
meditation intervention, our sample size was small and lacked
statistical power to do more robust analyses or detect smaller
effects. Future studies evaluating similar interventions on
elevated or clinical levels of general anxiety should include larger,
possibly more representative samples. Regarding our sample
size and composition, here we are somewhat limited in the
generalizability of our results. Our sample was comprised of
predominantly white women between the ages of 35 and 50.
While this may be an important demographic for this type of
intervention, the results tell us little about how other populations
might respond. Similarly, roughly two-thirds of the sample in
this study engaged in some kind of contemplative practice each
week. It is unclear how this may have influenced participant
interaction with the VR meditation experience. An area that
remains to be examined is whether individuals with very different
levels of meditative experience engage or benefit from similar VR
experiences comparably.
As previously pointed out, another notable limitation was
that the two groups, the intervention and the control samples,
were recruited and ran separately. Time and resource limitations
caused a delay in acquiring the control group sample by
about 3 months. The intervention group was fully collected
from September-to-November, while the control group was
fully collected across February-to-May. It is unclear what, if
any, confounding effects resulted from this, suffice to say this
was not experimentally optimal and the exact nature and
consequence of this serial order, non-randomized, data collection
is generally unknown. However, tentatively we did not observe
any irrevocable signs of this causing major effects or influences.
Our samples were identically recruited, closely matching across
demographic characteristics (Table 1), and demonstrated very
comparable electrophysiological and anxiety reporting patterns
across baseline comparisons.
Aside from these more broad-based limitations, we also
acknowledge that the results and interpretations of this pilot
are by no means definitive, and more research is needed
to verify and better elucidate therapeutic mechanisms of
this, or similar, VR interventions. Our primary findings were
that the VR experience uniquely affected broad and regional
Beta activity, with emerging EEG patterns consistent with
reductions in anxiety, and physiological hyperarousal. Again,
previous research supports our interpretation that this effect is
likely indicative of an adaptive state change and a reduction
of experiential anxiety; and our results hold early promise
based on these connections. However, more research must
be conducted to clearly elucidate the nature of high Beta
activity in relation to state and trait anxiety manifestations
and how interventions, such as we have presented here, can
play a maximal therapeutic role. Here, we were restricted in
our ability to address such concerns, limited by our reliance
on the STAI-state as the sole dependent measure of anxiety.
Future research would benefit from including multiple measures
to specifically assess changes in cognitive content or somatic
indicators of arousal or stress. Our results will need to be
replicated and expanded on with a more robust variety of
measures.
It will also be important to devise studies which isolate
the elements of the VR experience to more clearly define the
“
active ingredients” of VR based interventions, such as the
one tested here. Independently, viewing nature, and practicing
mindfulness can both reduce anxiety and promote state changes.
This VR experiment has both elements making it unclear if
one factor played more of a role that the other, or if perhaps
the sum of these parts in the VR experience was/is greater
than each factor additively combined. Future studies could also
expand on this pilot by including an active control group
engaged in a standard relaxation exercise, or an audio-only
guided meditation. Such a comparison between groups would
provide additional clarity about the potential impact of VR
in reducing stress/anxiety above and beyond already existing
interventions. Because this is a relatively new and novel approach,
future studies with this type of experience should also include
follow up questionnaires and/or participant interviews to better
ascertain the internal state and reaction to elements of the
VR experience, making it easier to interpret specific EEG
changes.
Finally, beyond examining the acute effects of a brief single VR
session, as we have investigated here, it will also be important to
study the effects of longer or repeated VR intervention programs,
or to evaluate the potential benefits of VR based meditation
experience as an adjunct to traditional psychotherapy. There are
still a number of important areas still requiring attention, such
as optimal therapeutic VR “
dosages,”session frequencies, and/or

the very nature of how best to integrate VR interventions into
broader treatment plans.
CONCLUSION
Our results support the notion that intentionally crafted VR
experiences can be therapeutically effective, and may result in
immediate, adaptive psychophysiological outcomes. Although
there are a number of limitations present in the current
study, here we have provided early evidence that VR based
meditation interventions have the potential to play an important
role in anxiety management and stress reduction. As VR
technology becomes more accessible and user-friendly, this type
of intervention may find its way into a variety of environments
and applications. Because the technology is relatively easy to use,
it may serve as a wellness tool in work and school environments,
as an intervention for persons with lack of access to nature,
as a calming technique for persons receiving medical/dental
procedures, as an adjunct to traditional therapeutic interventions,
such as CBT programs for GAD, or any number of other
applications to increase the personal psychological wellbeing of
those in need.
