Abstract
Rat somatosensory cortex contains a large sexually monomorphic genital representation.
Genital cortex undergoes an unusual 2-fold expansion during puberty. Here, we investigate
genital cortex development and female rat sexual maturation. Ovariectomies and estradiol
injections suggested sex hormones cause the pubertal genital cortex expansion but not its
maintenance at adult size. Genital cortex expanded by thalamic afferents invading sur-
rounding dysgranular cortex. Genital touch was a dominant factor driving female sexual
maturation. Raising female rats in contact with adult males promoted genital cortex expan-
sion, whereas contact to adult females or nontactile (audio-visual-olfactory) male cues did
not. Genital touch imposed by human experimenters powerfully advanced female genital
cortex development and sexual maturation. Long-term blocking of genital cortex by tetrodo-
toxin in pubescent females housed with males prevented genital cortex expansion and
decelerated vaginal opening. Sex hormones, sexual experience, and neural activity shape
genital cortex, which contributes to the puberty promoting effects of sexual touch.
Author summary
We recently identified the somatosensory representation of rat genitals; remarkably, this
cortical region—genital cortex—is sexually monomorphic, despite the marked sexual
dimorphism of external genitals in rats. Most intriguing was the observation that genital
cortex doubles in size during puberty. In order to shed light on this unusual expansion,
we studied genital cortex development and sexual maturation in the female rat. We first
showed that sex hormones are likely to cause the pubertal expansion of genital cortex.
Next, we examined whether sexual experience affects the development of female genital
cortex. Raising females together with adult males advanced genital cortex expansion, but
cohousing with adult females or exposure to nontactile male cues was not sufficient to
drive genital cortex growth. Surprisingly, artificial genital touch led to an early onset of
female puberty and growth of genital cortex. In line with this finding, we find that if geni-
tal cortex activity is blocked, the advancing effects of adult males on puberty and genital
cortex growth are inhibited. Together, our results point to an important role of genital
cortex in the puberty-promoting effects of sexual touch.

 Introduction
Early analysis of the development of visual cortex by Hubel and Wiesel focused on binocular
interactions and showed that both anatomy and physiology of ocular dominance is plastic and
shaped in a visually-driven, activity-dependent process [1]. In a similar vein, the development
of circuits in the somatosensory cortex (S1) was studied. It was recognized early on that precise
topographic (barrel) representation of the whisker pattern in cortical input layer 4 [2] is
imposed by peripheral inputs and has an early and brief critical period, after which it can no
longer be changed [3]. Subsequent work identified neurogenetic mechanisms of cortical pat-
tern formation [4]. With few exceptions, [5] most of the work provided little evidence for neu-
ral activity dependent processes in the development of S1. From work on the barrel cortex a
consensus emerged that cortical input layer 4 has an earlier critical period and shows less plas-
ticity than other cortical layers [6]. In the light of aforementioned results, the recently described
developmental pattern of cortical input layer 4 of genital S1 was very surprising. Specifically,
layer 4 of rat genital cortex showed a major expansion during puberty [7]. We wondered if this
very late development of genital cortex has implications for the role of activity in cortical devel-
opment and might even allow early sexual experience to impact on cortical development.
We were also interested in the relationship between somatosensory genital cortex develop-
ment and female sexual maturation. In rodents, puberty has been intensely studied and much
is known about changes in subcortical structures, such as the hypothalamus, that are associated
with puberty [8]; there is, however, virtually no information available about changes in cortical
circuits during puberty. A host of studies in a wide variety of species came to the conclusion
that sexual maturation is not a purely age-dependent process but is also under social control.
In mice, studies on female sexual development showed puberty advancing effects of male
(primer) pheromones [9] and puberty delaying effects of adult female pheromones [10]. Most
of the research on the social control of puberty has focused on pheromones [10] and identified
the vomeronasal organ as key mediator of such effects in mice [11]. There is also evidence,
however, that tactile interactions and sexual touch can powerfully influence sexual develop-
ment. For example, the extreme reproductive suppression in the eusocial mole rat appears to
be mediated by tactile rather than olfactory cues [12]. In a landmark study on mice, Bronson
and Maruniak [13] showed that the puberty advancing effects of male pheromones alone are
small. Bronson and Maruniak [13] suggested that the advance in female puberty caused by
adult males results from a synergistic interaction of pheromones and tactile stimulation; Bron-
son and Maruniak [13] also ruled out a role of visual and auditory cues. The underlying neural
mechanisms and pathways mediating male touch induced advance of female puberty are still
unknown.
In primates, the evidence for pheromonal effects on puberty is rather mixed [14]. Sexual
touch, on the other hand, is strictly regulated in most human cultures and this is particularly
true during development. It has also become painfully clear that sexual abuse and inappropri-
ate sexual contact during development have long-lasting detrimental consequences [15,16].
Presumably the long-lasting problems from inappropriate sexual contact during development
reflect brain changes resulting from sexual experience. Remarkably, structural brain imaging
in humans with a history of sexual abuse identified a thinning of putative human genital cor-
tex, as a cortical consequence of childhood sexual abuse [17].
Here we ask the following questions: (1) Are sex hormones required for the pubertal expan-
sion of female genital cortex? (2) What are the structural events underlying genital map
changes? (3) Does sexual experience affect the development of female genital cortex? (4) Does
activity in female genital cortex affect female puberty and does it mediate the female puberty
advancing effects of male sexual touch?

 Results
Pubertal expansion, but not maintenance of an adult size genital cortex,
requires sex hormones
As a first step in our analysis we performed additional experiments to confirm our recently
reported data on the growth of genital cortex during puberty [7]. To this end we analyzed the
layer 4 cortical input maps in the S1 of 6 young (approximate postnatal day [P] 21) and 7 old
(approximately P42) female rats. Specifically, we performed cytochrome oxidase staining,
which reveals granular layer 4 regions (S1A–S1D Fig). We confirmed our earlier conclusions:
whereas the clitoris representation in young prepubescent animals was rather small (Fig 1A), it
appears to be twice as big in adult animals (P42, Fig 1B and 1E; P < 0.01, Student t test). In
contrast, the size of the entire S1 did not differ significantly between young and old females
(Fig 1G; P = 0.3, Student t test).
Next, we examined whether sex hormones play a role during the pubertal expansion of gen-
ital cortex. Hence, we ovariectomized females before (at P21) and after puberty (at P42).
Twenty days after the ovariectomy animals were killed, brains were removed and tangential
sections through the S1 were prepared and stained for cytochrome oxidase activity (S1C and
S1D Fig). We obtained detailed anatomical maps of layer 4 from 7 prepubertal (Fig 1C) and 6
postpubertal (Fig 1D) ovariectomized females. Fig 1C shows a drawing of a complete S1 (thick
outline) body map of a female aged P42, in which we removed the ovaries before puberty (at
P21). The size of the cortical clitoris representation is small and comparable to the one of the
young female, as depicted in Fig 1A. The somatosensory cortical map obtained from a female
rat ovariectomized after puberty at P42 (Fig 1D) allows 2 observations: (1) the clitoris repre-
sentation is much larger than the one of the female rat ovariectomized before puberty; (2) the
size of the genital cortex is comparable to the genital cortex size of an adult female (Fig 1B).
The population data (Fig 1E) suggest the same conclusions. The clitoris representation in
females ovariectomized before puberty (mean genital cortex of S1 1.07% ± 0.09) was compara-
ble to young females (1.07% ± 0.06) but significantly (P < 0.01, Student t test) smaller than the
genital cortex size in animals, which were ovariectomized after puberty (1.6% ± 0.15; Fig 1F).
Comparison of the genital cortex to the posteromedial barrel subfield (PMBSF), instead of
the whole S1, led to the same results (S2A–S2C Fig) with no difference in the variability (S1
Table).
We conclude that sex hormones are required for the pubertal expansion of female genital
cortex but not for the maintenance of an adult size female genital cortex.
Systemic estrogen treatment accelerates genital cortex growth and
advances female puberty
A strong impact of sex hormones on the onset of puberty has been reported using systemic
estradiol injections during prepuberty [18]. We wondered to what extent systemic estrogen
treatment can accelerate genital cortex growth. Female rats enter puberty typically at the age of
P34 to P38 [19]. On that account and based on the study by Ramirez and Sawyer [18], we
chose to treat females aged P26 for 5 days with estrogen and to test a possible effect on genital
cortex at P30. Prepubescent females (P26) were injected over 5 days with either in sesame oil
dissolved estradiol (Fig 2A, upper panel; n = 7 animals; 0.05μg estradiol, dissolved in 0.4 ml of
sesame oil, per 100 g body weight) or with sesame oil alone (Fig 2B, upper panel; n = 7 animals;
0.4 ml of sesame oil, per 100 g body weight). During the fifth day of treatment animals were
killed and cortical hemispheres were flattened, tangentially sectioned and processed for cyto-
chrome oxidase activity (S3A and S3B Fig). In order to obtain cortical body maps, granular

 somatosensory regions were reconstructed through serial sections. To exclude experimenter
biases cortical maps were drawn and analyzed by an experimenter blind to the condition estra-
diol versus oil treated animals.
The lower panel in Fig 2A shows a cortical map obtained from an oil-treated female. A cor-
tical map obtained from a female, which was injected with estradiol, is shown in the lower
panel of Fig 2B. The size of the clitoris representation is much larger in the estrogen treated
female. Population data for all hemispheres confirm this result. The absolute area of genital
cortex (Fig 2C; mean absolute area in oil injected animals was 0.33mm2 ± 0.025 and in estra-
diol injected animals 0.5mm2 ± 0.028; P < 0.001, Student t test) and the mean percentage of
genital cortex of S1 (Fig 2D; mean genital cortex of S1 in estradiol treated animals was 1.6% ±
0.09 and in sesame oil injected animals 1.01% ± 0.06; P < 0.0001, Student t test) was signifi-
cantly greater in estradiol injected animals compared with control animals (oil treated). The
size of S1 was not different (Fig 2E; mean area of S1 in oil treated animals was 32.9mm2 ± 0.76
and in estradiol treated animals 31.2mm2 ± 0.68; P = 0.1, Student t test).
We also assessed parameters indicative of sexual maturation and the onset of puberty.
Thus, we evaluated vaginal opening (an open vagina is typically seen in females, which have
entered puberty, [18]) and the weight of the uterus, which is heavier in females after puberty
[18]. Accordingly, we documented vaginal opening before, during and after the daily injec-
tions. In Fig 2F, 2 photographs show the clitoris and vagina of an oil treated female before the
beginning of daily injections (P25, upper panel) and afterwards (P30, lower panel). Vagina and
clitoris for an estrogen treated animal are shown in Fig 2G, respectively. Whereas the vagina of
the oil treated female was still closed at P30, the estradiol injected animal shows an open vagina
at this stage (Fig 2G, lower panel), indicating that the onset of puberty took place. To quantify
vaginal opening, we gave the following scores for every vaginal opening stage (Fig 2H): a score
of 0 points to a closed vagina, whereas a score of 1 indicates an open vagina. A score of 0.5
represents the intermediate state, during which the vagina was about to open. The majority of
oil treated females (6 out of 7) showed a closed vagina at P30, whereas most of the estrogen
injected animals displayed an open vagina (6 out of 7; P < 0.001, Mann–Whitney U test).
We also removed and weighed the uteri. On average, the oil-treated animals had lighter
uteri (0.15g ± 0.07, Fig 2I) compared to animals, which received daily estradiol injections
(0.29g ± 0.08), but this difference did not reach significance (P = 0.08, Student t test). Taken
together these data suggest that systemic estradiol accelerates genital cortex growth and
advances the onset of puberty.
Genital cortex growth is due to the invasion of dysgranular cortex by
putative genital thalamic afferents
Which cellular changes underlie the unusual genital cortex expansion during puberty? To
answer this question, we first stained alternating tangential sections of flattened cortices for
cytochrome oxidase activity (S4A Fig) and with vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGluT2)
antibodies (S4B Fig). While cytochrome oxidase reports constitutive layer 4 metabolic activity,
VGluT2 is expressed in thalamocortical terminals [20] and, hence, labels thalamic afferents.
S4A Fig (upper panel) shows a tangential section through S1 of a young animal (P14) stained
for cytochrome oxidase activity and in S4B Fig (upper panel) the subsequent section is shown
hemispheres of P25, P42 females, and females which were ovariectomized at either P20 or P42. Note that there is a substantial
growth of the genital cortex between P25 and P42 animals. Female rats ovariectomized during prepuberty had smaller genital
cortices than animals ovariectomized after puberty. (G) Absolute area of S1 in hemispheres of P25, P42, in prepuberty (P20)

 labeled for VGluT2. The labeled structures have the same layout and size, as confirmed by
quantitatively analyzed drawings (S4A and S4B Fig, lower panels). In old animals, alternating
staining for cytochrome oxidase activity and with VGluT2 also led to completely overlapping
results. We conclude from these observations that pubertal genital cortex growth leads to an
expansion of the cortical area innervated by thalamic afferents.
Next, we asked, how the genital cortex is able to increase its thalamically innervated area so
drastically. Does the genital cortex expand like a balloon, pushing the neighboring cortex aside?
Alternatively, do genital afferents invade neighboring territories? To address this issue, we ana-
lyzed S1 maps from young and old animals in more detail (Fig 1A and 1B). Specifically, we
measured the space between fore- and hindpaw, as shown in Fig 3A and 3B, and named it
interlimb cortex. The interlimb cortex (grey zone) is dysgranular in structure (i.e., does not
have a distinct layer 4) and is larger in the map of a young animal (P25; Fig 3A, upper panel)
than in the one of an old animal (P48; Fig 3B, upper panel). This size decrease is very surpris-
ing, as S1 grows overall by approximately 15% during puberty (note that this growth in S1 did
not reach significance between young and old females; Fig 1). Cytochrome oxidase stained
sections (Fig 3A and 3B, lower panels) confirm this result. Whereas the absolute genital cortex
area almost doubles in size from P21 to P42 (Fig 3C), the absolute interlimb cortex area slightly
decreases (Fig 3D; mean interlimb cortex area in S1 maps of young animals was 0.64mm2 ±
0.06 and in old animals 0.56mm2 ± 0.1). Interestingly, the ratio of the genital cortex to the inter-
limb cortex significantly increases during puberty (Fig 3E; mean ratio of genital cortex to the
interlimb area in young animals was 0.35 ± 0.035 and in old animals 0.51 ± 0.017; P < 0.001,
Student t test). The simultaneous increase of genital cortex and decrease of interlimb cortex
suggest that the pubertal genital cortex growth reflects an invasion of dysgranular interlimb
cortex by putative genital thalamic afferents.
Genital cortex growth in prepubescent females is accelerated by tactile
cues from males
Although sex hormones have been identified as important players during the onset of puberty,
there is also evidence that somatosensory stimuli (olfactory or tactile) can influence sexual
development. Thus, we assessed if sexual experience affects the development of female genital
cortex. To this end, we chose the following experimental paradigm, which is inspired by the
seminal work of Bronson and Maruniak [13]. Prepubescent females (P21) were cohoused for 9
days with (1) sexually experienced females (Fig 4A, upper panel), or with (2) sexually experi-
enced males (Fig 4A, middle panel), or with (3) sexually experienced males separated by a wire
mesh (Fig 4A, lower panel). In the first 2 groups, the animals had direct contact to interaction
partners. In the third group, animals were cohoused but had no tactile access to them because
of a wire mesh dividing the cage (Fig 4A, lower panel). Importantly, bedding was swapped

estradiol animals, showed an open vagina at P30. Each dot represents the score of vaginal opening for one
animal. (I) Uterus weights of oil and estradiol treated animals. The uterus in estradiol treated animals is

 between the 2 cage compartments daily, such that females received full exposure to phero-
monal cues. Females were also able to see and hear the adult male. At the age of P30 animals
were killed. Brains were removed and tangential sections through layer 4 of S1 were prepared
and stained for cytochrome oxidase activity. The experimenter reconstructing and analyzing
cortical maps was again blind to the experimental condition.
In Fig 4B somatosensory cortical maps are shown for all 3 experimental conditions (upper
panel: map obtained from a female cohoused with a female; middle panel: map from a female
cohoused with a male; lower panel: map from a female, which sat together with a male, but
with a wire-mesh separating the animals). Note that the cortical clitoris representation is the
largest in the map of the female cohoused together with a sexually experienced male. In fact,
the cortical clitoris representation (Fig 4C) and the fraction of clitoris of the entire S1 (Fig 4D)
increased significantly more, when prepubescent females received male tactile cues (filled blue
circles, mean genital cortex of S1 1.9% ± 0.1) compared to female tactile cues (filled red circles,
mean genital cortex of S1 1.36% ± 0.1). Interestingly, pheromones and audio-visual contact
alone were insufficient to drive genital cortex growth (open blue circle, mean genital cortex of
S1 1.3% ± 0.1). A 1-way ANOVA also reported a significant difference between prepubescent
females cohoused with either males, females, or males without having tactile contact (P = 0.01).
The overall size of S1 (Fig 4E) did not differ between groups (P = 0.67, 1-way ANOVA). Note
that the relative size of genital cortex of the young females, which were cohoused with sexually
experienced males (mean genital cortex of S1 1.9% ± 0.1, Fig 4D filled blue circles), is similar to
that of the adult females (mean genital cortex of S1 1.8% ± 0.1, Fig 1B), even though we killed
these animals at P30, which would correspond to midpuberty group raised animals. These find-
ings suggest, that male sexual touch strongly advances female genital cortex growth.
Artificial genital touch drives genital cortex expansion and promotes
female sexual maturation
We were surprised to observe such big effects following cohousing with sexually experienced
males, while male olfactory cues had no impact on genital cortex development. These observa-
tions made us wonder about the relative contributions of tactile and other cues on female sex-
ual maturation and genital cortex development. What are the contact cues that drive genital
cortex expansion and promote female sexual maturation? It has previously been shown, that
gentle touch of female genitals creates conditioned place preference in female rats [21] and
increases 50kHz range trill calls emitted by hormonally primed females [22]. Similarly, we set
up an experiment, where prepubescent female rats (P23) were exposed to artificial genital
touch (Fig 5). During a 10-minute session, animals were freely moving in a small U-shaped
environment, while the female experimenter repeatedly touched the animals’ clitoris and vulva
with a lubricated brush (artificial genital touch, Fig 5B). Control animals were placed in the
same environment for 10 minutes without genital touch (Fig 5A). For 7 days, each animal
completed 3 sessions distributed across the day. Animals were killed at P30 and S1 maps were
reconstructed with the experimenter being blind to the condition. Control animals (Fig 5C)
had a smaller genital cortex than animals, which received artificial genital touch (Fig 5D). Such
differences in absolute (Fig 5E) and relative size of genital cortex (Fig 5F) were significant. The
effect size was comparable to the differences observed between male and female touch in Fig 4;
young animal and that the clitoris representation is larger. (C) Absolute area of the clitoris representation in hemispheres of young (P25)
and old (P42) animals. The clitoris representation almost doubles in size. (D) Same as (C), but the absolute area of the interlimb cortex is

 the size of the entire S1 was not different (Fig 5G). Artificial genital touch also affected female
sexual maturation. While there was no significant change in vaginal opening (Fig 5J), the uteri
were significantly heavier following artificial genital touch, as compared with control rats (Fig
5H and 5I).
Blockade of neuronal activity prevents genital cortex growth and delays
vaginal opening
In order to better understand the role of female genital cortex during puberty, we blocked gen-
ital cortex activity over a certain time during prepuberty (P23–P30). To do so, P21 animals
received Elvax implants over the area of genital cortex. Elvax sheets were developed for the
slow, gradual release of drugs [23]. Elvax sheets were either soaked with tetrodotoxin (TTX)
(Fig 6B), which blocks voltage dependent sodium channels, or impregnated with Ringer, as a
control condition (Fig 6A). After recovery, the implanted females were cohoused with sexually
experienced males until the age of P30. S1 maps of the brains were obtained as described
above. The experimenter reconstructing cortical maps was again blind to the experimental
condition. A map from a control animal treated with ringer is shown in Fig 6C, while Fig 6D
shows a cortical map obtained from a TTX treated female. In animals, in which genital cortex
was blocked with TTX, the area of clitoris representation (Fig 6E; mean area in maps of control
animals was 0.48mm2 ± 0.02 and in S1 of TTX treated animals 0.32mm2 ± 0.013; P < 0.0001,
Student t test) and the relative size (Fig 6F) was smaller than in control animals. The area of S1
did not show any differences (Fig 6G; mean area of S1 in Ringer treated animals was 32.4mm2
± 1.4 and in TTX implanted animals 33.1mm2 ± 1.1; P = 0.7, Student t test). The difference
between hemispheres from control (mean genital cortex of S1 was 1.49% ± 0.05) and TTX
treated animals (mean genital cortex of S1 was 1.02% ± 0.05) was marked (P < 0.0001, Student
t test). These results immediately suggest 2 conclusions. First, the fact that there was a differ-
ence between control and TTX treated animals indicates that our TTX treatment was effective.
Second, the data indicate that the pubertal expansion of genital cortex requires cortical
activity.
Next, we wondered if an intact genital cortex is required for female sexual maturation.
Therefore, we determined the status of puberty in control and TTX treated animals. Accord-
ingly, pictures of vagina and clitoris were taken before implantation and after the behavioral
experiment. Five out of 13 animals, which received a ringer soaked Elvax sheet above genital
cortex, showed an open vagina at the end of the experiment. The vagina before (left panel) and
after the experiment (right panel) for one of those females is shown in Fig 6H. In contrast,
only 1 of the animals (n = 11), whose genital cortices were blocked with TTX, had an open
vagina. Fig 6I shows the pictures of 1 TTX animal before (left panel) and after (right panel) the
treatment. The scores of vaginal opening are plotted in Fig 6J. The vaginas were closed in 9 out
of 11 animals treated with TTX, and we observed a vagina that was about to open in only 1
TTX treated animal. In contrast, only 2 out of 13 animals in the Ringer group had the vagina
still closed at the end of the experiment. The uterine weights (Fig 6K) were not significantly
but not tactile cues from a sexually experienced adult male. (C) Absolute area of genital cortex in hemispheres

 different, however. Thus, genital cortex activity might relay effects of male sexual touch on vag-
inal opening in rat female puberty.
The relation between relative genital cortex size, estrogens, and uterine
weight
In order to obtain insight in the relationship between female sexual maturation and genital
cortex development, we plotted genital cortex size against uterine weight in all experiments, in
which we collected such data (S5 Fig). As shown in S5A Fig, there was no tight relationship
between relative genital cortex size and uterine weight. Nonetheless, it was obvious that a large
uterine weight (�0.15 g) is rarely associated with a small (�1%) relative genital cortex size. If
one compared genital cortex size and uterine weight across specific experimental conditions
(S5B Fig), it was noticeable that animals with TTX treatment of genital cortex (the experiment
described in Fig 6) never had very large genital cortices, even for cases with a large uterus.
Discussion
Our data confirm a major pubertal expansion of female genital cortex, which—unlike the
maintenance of large genital cortex in adults—requires intact ovaries and sex hormones. The
larger area of genital cortex in adults reflects an invasion of adjacent territories by thalamic
afferents. Such changes in female genital cortex are advanced by sexual touch and require cor-
tical activity. Most interestingly, blockade of genital cortex delays female sexual maturation,
suggesting that genital cortex is the neural structure that mediates the puberty advancing
effects of male sexual touch.
The expansion of layer 4 of genital cortex in puberty [7] is an unusual pattern in the devel-
opment of layer 4 in S1. In contrast, the barrel representation is characterized by a brief
directly postnatal critical period, after which the barrel pattern can no longer be changed [3].
Our data show that intact ovaries and, hence, presumably the sex hormones emitted by the
ovaries are required for the pubertal expansion of genital cortex. The interpretation that sex
hormones drive pubertal expansion is greatly strengthened by observations following the
injection of estradiol, which mimics the pubertal expansion of genital cortex. The mechanisms,
by which sex hormones, and in particular estrogens, drive pubertal expansion of genital cortex,
are yet to be determined; both, a direct sex hormone effect on genital cortex and an indirect
effect via growth stimulation of sex organs (i.e., the clitoris) by sex hormones are conceivable.
Thus, it is possible that cortical changes follow similar mechanism, as described for the hippo-
campus, in which a rapid potentiation of excitatory synapses is achieved by estrogen [24] with
different underlying mechanism in male and female rats [25]. From human studies, it is
known that the hippocampus changes in size along the reproductive cycle with the biggest hip-
pocampus being present when blood estrogen levels are highest [26].
The data discussed below indicate that at least some stage of cortical activity seems to be
required for genital cortex expansion. The visualization of thalamic afferents by VGluT2 anti-
bodies showed that cytochrome oxidase staining reveals maps completely congruent with tha-
lamic innervation. Thus, the size increase of genital cortex in adults indicates that a larger

 cortical area is innervated by thalamic afferents. The detailed analysis of body maps in young
and adult animals is strongly suggestive that the size increase of genital cortex results from an
invasion scenario, in which putative genital afferents innervate neighboring dysgranular
cortex.
Female genital cortex development is strongly affected by tactile sexual experience. Housing
pubescent females with a sexually experienced adult male strongly advances the growth of
genital cortex. Even though we killed such females at P30 (which corresponds in group-housed
animals to midpuberty), they had genital cortices larger than average adult size (compare Figs
2D and 4D). This advancement of puberty was induced specifically by direct male contact and
was not seen in animals cohoused but not touched by males, or in animals cohoused with
females. In line with the idea that genital cortex is altered by sexual experience, we find that
blockade of genital cortex prevents the pubertal layer 4 expansion of genital cortex. The require-
ment of experience and cortical activity for the appropriate development of adult somatotopy is
similar to the requirement of cortical activity for the development of ocular dominance col-
umns in the visual system [27]. It is notably different, however, from the development of the
early postnatal development of the barrel pattern in S1, which occurs despite manipulation of
peripheral [28] or cortical inputs [29]. Thus, genital cortex does seem to differ from barrel cor-
tex not only in the timing of the critical period, but also the cellular mechanisms mediating gen-
ital cortex plasticity seem to differ from barrel cortex.
Whereas our blocking experiments show that genital cortex activity is crucial for the puber-
tal layer 4 expansion, it is questionable to what extent this plasticity is functionally meaningful.
Decorticated animals are still able to mount and reproduce. However, subtle changes in the
pattern of reproduction [30,31] are observed. Furthermore, somatosensory feedback from the
penis was shown to be critical for the achievement of intromission, and somatosensory feed-
back from the preputial region is needed for the execution of copulatory thrusting [32]. Block-
ing genital cortex activity during the critical period of puberty may cause changes in the
pattern of reproduction during adulthood, i.e., that the number of intromissions and time to
ejaculation might be affected (in males); lordosis or place preference behavior could be affected
in females.
As shown many decades ago, the social signals powerfully control the advance of puberty
[33]. While it became clear that pheromonal stimuli mediated by the vomeronasal organ [11]
contribute to the male induced advance in female puberty in mice, the hastening effects of
puberty induced by male pheromones alone are minor. Bronson and Maruniak [13] suggested
that tactile male cues synergistically with pheromones advance female puberty. Further work
showed that androgenized female mice [34], but not castrated male mice [13], provide the tac-
tile female puberty promoting cues. Our artificial genital touch experiment showed a major
effect of genital touch on female sexual maturation. The effects of artificial genital touch on
uterine weight (Fig 5I) were even larger than the male effects seen in some of our control

opened vagina or a half opened vagina, which was about to open after being cohoused for 7 days with sexually experienced adult males.
In contrast, almost all animals implanted with TTX Elvax sheets had the vagina closed at P30. Each dot represents the score of vaginal
opening for 1 animal. (K) Uterine weights of females with implanted Ringer or TTX Elvax sheets after being cohoused with sexually

 experiments (Fig 6K). Thus, our data point to genital touch as a dominant cue for inducing
puberty and question the idea that a sensory synergism is required [13]. Our data show that an
intact female genital cortex promotes vaginal opening. Thus, the data suggest that genital cor-
tex might be a tactile gateway through which sexual touch promotes female puberty. This ques-
tion requires further investigation, however, as we did not observe an effect of genital cortex
blockade on uterine weight, as described previously in rats [33]. The receptive field properties
of genital cortex appear to be tuned to sexual tactile contacts associated with mating [7] and,
hence, seem well-suited to relay signals arising from sexual touch. The ensemble of our sys-
temic female hormone application effects on genital cortex growth and our puberty advancing
effects established by genital touch leads to speculation about a possible bidirectional connec-
tion between genital cortex and the medial preoptic nucleus of the hypothalamus. This region
contains gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons whose activity produces high fre-
quency of GnRH release which, in turn, causes gametogenesis and an increase in gonadal ste-
roid hormone secretion [35].
Materials and methods
Ethics statement
All experimental procedures were performed according to German guidelines on animal wel-
fare under the supervision of local ethics committees (animal permit numbers: G0193/14 and
G0244/16).
Animals
All experiments were conducted on Wistar rats purchased from Janvier Labs. All animals were
kept on a 12 hour to 12 hour, normal light/dark cycle with lights off at 10:00 PM. Rats had ad
libitum access to food and water.
Ovariectomies
Ovariectomies were performed in prepubescent (P21) and adult Wistar rats (P42). For the sur-
gery, animals were anesthetized by injection of an initial dose of 100 mg/kg ketamine and 7.5
mg/kg xylazine. Respiration, blink, and pinch reflex were observed throughout the surgery
and, if needed, animals were injected with an extra shot (25%) of ketamine/xylazine mixture
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) or a 25% dose of ketamine (Sigma-Aldrich) alone. Monitoring
of temperature was done using a rectal probe and could be maintained with a heating pad
(Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL) to 34˚C–36˚C.
To remove ovaries a small incision was made bilaterally on the animal’s bag. The white fat
pad, to which the ovaries are attached to, was pulled out through the body wall. Ovaries were
grabbed with forceps and removed from the fallopian tube using small scissors. After success-
ful removal, the white fat pad with fallopian tube was put back through the body wall. The inci-
sion was sutured using a self-resorbing thread. The wound was disinfected and looked after in
the days following surgery.
Estradiol treatment
Immature Wistar rats (P26) were divided randomly into groups of 3–4 animals. All animals
were weighed daily and the vagina opening was assessed by visual inspection and defined as a
complete separation of the membranous sheath covering the vaginal orifice [36]. Photos of cli-
toris and vagina were taken before the first injection and after the experiment. The assessment
of vaginal opening was not blind but the different stages were very clear to detect.

 Animals in the testing group were injected subcutaneously every morning with 0.05 μg
17β-estradiol (Sigma-Aldrich), dissolved in 0.4 ml of sesame oil (Sigma-Aldrich), per 100 g
body weight. Rats in the control group received the same amount of sesame oil. On day 5 of
the treatment, animals were deeply anaesthetized, perfused, and their brains processed, as
described below. In addition, uteri of every animal in experiment was taken out while perfu-
sion and weighed.
Experiments on sexual touch during development
Wistar rats aged P21 were divided into 3 groups. Each animal of group 1 was housed for 9 days
together with a sexually experienced adult female rat (approximately P60). Every rat of group 2
was put for 9 days together with a sexually experienced adult male rat (approximately P60).
Group 3 rats were also housed together with a sexually experienced adult male rat (approxi-
mately P60), but the cages were separated by a wire-mesh. Whereas the animals of group 1 and
2 were able to interact fully with their housing partner, the rats in group 3 could not touch the
male they were housed together with. However, they were able to smell, see, and hear the male
through the wire-mesh.
Vaginal opening was documented as described above, and pictures of clitoris and vagina
were taken before and after the experiment. After 9 days, at the age of P30, animals of all
groups were anaesthetized, perfused, and their brains histologically processed as described
below. Uteri of all animals were taken out while perfusion and weighed.
Artificial genital touch
Prepubescent female Wistar rats (P23) were divided into 2 groups. Control animals were
placed 3 times for 10 minutes in a small U-shaped arena over 7 days without further treatment
and were then returned to their home cage. Animals in the artificial genital touch group were
placed 3 times for 10 minutes in a small arena over 7 days, and their clitoris and vulva were
contacted with a lubricated brush by a human (female) experimenter (similar to Parada, 2010,
[21]). After 7 days (at the age of P30), animals of all groups were anaesthetized, perfused, and
their brains histologically processed, as described below. Uteri of all animals were taken out
while perfusing and weighed.
Experiments on blockade of S1 with TTX/Elvax
Animals (P21) were divided into 2 groups. The control group received a chronic Ringer-
impregnated Elvax sheet above genital cortex and the rats in the testing group were implanted
with a TTX-impregnated Elvax sheet above genital cortex.
Elvax implants were prepared as described before [29, 37, 38]. Briefly Elvax 40p (ethylene-
vinyl acetate copolymer; DuPont, Wilmington, DE) was washed for one week in 95% of Etha-
nol and afterwards dissolved in methylene chloride to obtain a 10% solution. TTX (Abcam,
Cambridge, UK) or Ringer (control) was then added in order to achieve a final concentration
of 2%. The TTX or Ringer containing Elvax mixture was poured into a glass mold and quickly
frozen for 1 hour at −80˚C. After 30 minutes, the blocks were removed from the mold and put
for another 3 days into the −80˚C freezer. On day 3, the Elvax TTX or control blocks were
transferred to the −20˚C and stored for another 3–4 days. Subsequently, the TTX and Ringer
impregnated blocks were cut on a vibratome (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) into 150 μm sheets,
which were cut into 2 mm squares using a scalpel. Before surgical implantation all Elvax sheets
were washed for at least 8 hours in distilled water.
For surgical implantation P21 Wistar rats were anesthetized by injection of an initial dose
of 100 mg/kg ketamine and 7.5 mg/kg xylazine. Respiration, blink, and pinch reflex were

 observed throughout the surgery and, if needed, animals were injected with an extra shot
(25%) of ketamine/xylazine mixture or a 25% dose of ketamine alone. Monitoring of tempera-
ture was done using a rectal probe and could be maintained with a heating pad to 34˚C–36˚C.
Lidocaine was locally injected in the scalp, which was then removed. A craniotomy was per-
formed above genital cortex, and the dura was removed using a bend syringe. The TTX or
Ringer impregnated sheets were placed on the brain surface and covered with silicone (Kwik-
Cast; World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL). The exposed skull was finally covered with
dental cement. Animals were allowed to recover from surgery for 2 days. Photos of clitoris and
vagina were taken before the behavioral experiment. At the age of P23, implanted animals
were put together with a sexually experienced male. After 7 days (at the age of P30), TTX and
control animals were anaesthetized and their vaginal opening was documented as described
above. Along with the perfusion, the uteri of the animals were cut out and weighed. Brains
were histologically processed as described below.
Histology
At the end of the above-described experiments, animals were anaesthetized using a 20% ure-
thane solution and perfused with phosphate buffer followed by a 2% paraformaldehyde solu-
tion (PFA). Brains were removed, hemispheres were separated, and cortices were flattened
between 2 glass slides separated by clay spacers [39]. Glass slides were weighed down with
small ceramic weights for approximately 3 hours. Afterwards, flattened cortices were stored
overnight in 2% PFA and 80 μm sections were cut on a Vibratome (Leica). Sections were
stained for cytochrome-oxidase activity using the protocol of Divac et al. [40]. After the stain-
ing procedure, sections were mounted on gelatin coated glass slides with Mowiol mounting
medium. Subsequently, pictures were taken on an Olympus BX51 microscope and layer 4
areas of S1 were drawn by using a Neurolucida software. S1 maps were reconstructed through
serial sections. To exclude experimenter biases, cortical maps were drawn and analyzed by an
experimenter blind to the conditions (e.g., estradiol versus sesame oil control group; TTX ver-
sus Ringer-treated group).
For the alternating staining procedure with cytochrome c and VGluT2, immunohistochem-
ical labeling was performed using standard procedures. Briefly, brain sections, which should
be labeled for VGluT2, were preincubated for an hour at room temperature in a blocking solu-
tion (0.1 M PBS, 2% bovine serum albumin, and 0.5% Triton X-100). Afterwards, primary
antibodies were diluted in a solution containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and 1% bovine serum
albumin. The primary antibody against VGluT2 was incubated with the free-floating sections
for at least 24 hours under mild shaking at 4˚C. Incubations with the primary antibody was fol-
lowed by detection with a secondary antibody coupled to the fluorophore Alexa 488. The sec-
ondary antibody was diluted (1:500) in 0.5% Triton X-100 and the reaction was allowed to
proceed for 2 hours in the dark at room temperature. After the staining procedure, sections
were mounted on gelatin coated glass slides with Mowiol mounting medium.
Quantification of somatosensory areas and sizes
The area of various somatosensory regions was measured by outlining the anatomical region
of interest and calculating its area using Neurolucida area calculating tool. The area of the fol-
lowing cortical representations was measured: hindpaw, forepaw, trunk, interlimb cortex, and
clitoris. The fraction of genital cortex of the whole S1 area was calculated by dividing the clito-
ris area by the value of the S1 area. The same was done for the fraction of genital cortex of the
interlimb cortex. All statistic tests were conducted in Matlab.

 Scoring of vaginal opening
In order to quantify the state of vaginal opening after the above described experiments, we
assigned different states with vaginal opening scores. A score of 0 points to a closed vagina,
whereas a score of 0.5 describes a vagina, which was about to open. Finally, a score of 1 repre-
sents an open vagina.
