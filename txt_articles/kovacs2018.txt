INTRODUCTION
The “ABCs” of trauma resuscitation were born from the assumption that correcting
hypoxemia and hypotension reduces morbidity and mortality. Definitive care for
severely injured or polytrauma patients includes the ability to provide advanced airway
management in a variety of settings: in the emergency department, 20% to 30% intu-
bations are for trauma.1,2 Airway management in the trauma patient presents
numerous unique challenges beyond placement of an endotracheal tube (ETT), with
outcomes dependent on the provider’s ability to predict and anticipate difficulty and
have a safe and executable plan.
DOES EARLY DEFINITIVE TRAUMA AIRWAY MANAGEMENT SAVE LIVES?
Despite significant advances in prehospital care, injury prevention, and the develop-
ment of trauma systems, early mortality from trauma has essentially remained

 unchanged.3 R. Adams Cowley, founder of Baltimore’s Shock Trauma Institute,
defined the “golden hour” as a window to arrest the physiologic consequences of se-
vere injury by rapidly transporting trauma patients to definitive care.4,5 The “stay and
play” versus “scoop and run” approach to prehospital trauma care has been a topic of
debate since the early 1980s.6,7 Specific to airway management, there is evidence to
support the argument that advanced airway management can be performed in the
prehospital setting without delaying transfer to a trauma center.8,9 More recent data
suggest that when performed by skilled emergency medical services (EMS) providers,
advanced airway management is associated with a significant decrease in mortal-
ity.9,10 In the hospital setting, delayed intubation is associated with increased mortality
in noncritically injured trauma patients.11
Conversely, there is a growing body of evidence that prehospital advanced airway

circum-
stances.8,12–14 How does one reconcile this seemingly conflicting data? Is endotra-
cheal intubation (ETI) for prehospital trauma patients harmful? The answer is, “it
depends.” The Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST) practice guide-
lines on ETI immediately following trauma acknowledged the conflicting prehospital
data, stating the following:
“No conclusion could be reached regarding prehospital intubation for patients with
traumatic brain injury, with or without RSI [rapid sequence intubation]. Diversity of pa-
tient population, differing airway algorithms, various experience among emergency
medical service personnel in ETI, and differing reporting make consensus difficult.”15
It may be that the technical, procedure-focused management imperative of “getting
the tube” is diverting attention away from the physiologic principles of oxygen delivery.
Translated physiologically, the ABC priorities of trauma resuscitation are “stop the
bleeding, maintain perfusion and oxygenate.” Lifesaving oxygenation maneuvers
may include a jaw thrust, temporary bag-mask ventilation (BMV), placement of a
supraglottic airway device, or ETI. Advanced does not necessarily mean better.
TRAUMA AND THE DIFFICULT AIRWAY
A “difficult airway” is defined as difficulty with laryngoscopy and intubation, BMV,
supraglottic device ventilation, and/or front of neck airway (FONA) access.16,17
Anatomic markers are in general poor predictors of difficulty with airway management,
with 90% of difficult intubations unanticipated, prompting debate about the value of
trying to predict what is usually unpredictable.18–21 The pathophysiology of trauma
adds an additional layer of complexity and difficulty (Table 1).
The “physiologically difficult airway” is used to describe nonanatomic patient fac-
tors that can influence the outcome of airway management. Uncorrected hypoxemia,
hypocapnia, and hypotension can have devastating consequences in the peri-
intubation period. All trauma patients should have both anatomic and physiologic fac-
tors considered, planned for, and ideally corrected as part of their airway plan.22
In patients in whom both ETI and rescue oxygenation (bag-mask or supraglottic
airway ventilation) are anticipated to be difficult, most existing airway algorithms
recommend an “awake” intubation approach, in which the patient maintains sponta-
neous respiration throughout the procedure. There are a variety of reasons why awake
intubation is uncommonly used for the trauma airway, and these are discussed later in
this text.
Although the difficult airway is defined with reference to an experienced airway pro-
vider with an array of available recourses, other context-related challenges, including
human factors, environment, clinician experience, and skill will invariably influence

 outcomes. Understanding when and why trauma patients may encounter difficulty in
airway management can help guide the logistical and mental exercise of developing
specific mitigating strategies and contingency planning. A call for help should always
be viewed as a patient-focused measure, not a sign of provider weakness.
AIRWAY MANAGEMENT TRAUMA SCENARIOS
The Head-Injured Patient
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the most common cause of mortality in trauma patients.
Airway management in this cohort of patients is often performed for airway protection.
Given the relatively high incidence of peri-intubation desaturation, hypocapnea, and
hypotension in emergency intubations, the benefit of ETI for airway protection to pre-
vent aspiration must be weighed against the risk of the occurrence of physiologic
adverse events known to increase morbidity and mortality in TBI patients.23–26 If intu-
bating for the purpose of airway protection, it is usually less time sensitive and should

 not be rushed. Every precaution should be taken to adequately preoxygenate and
resuscitate first.
Apnea resulting from head injury requires immediate intervention. There are 3 mech-
anisms by which apnea may occur in TBI:
1. Severe or catastrophic brain injury
2. Impact brain apnea (IBA)
3. Loss of consciousness with resultant functional airway obstruction
Severe or catastrophic brain injury is usually nonsurvivable, and associated with
early death. Predictions of outcome are usually not made until the patient has under-
gone a full trauma resuscitation, which often includes ETI. Contrastingly, IBA and func-
tional airway obstruction may be correctable with simple airway opening maneuvers,
with or without brief ventilation support. IBA from head trauma results in a primary res-
piratory arrest without significant parenchymal injury to the brain.27 In contrast to pa-
tients with head injury with functional airway obstruction, patients with IBA do not
respond to simple airway opening maneuvers alone, and may require brief ventilation
support to prevent secondary hypoxic insult. With appropriate treatment, prognosis is
generally good.
Head-injured patients with a decreased level of consciousness frequently receive
prehospital advanced airway management.10 In one series, 30% to 40% of patients
are assessed as having partial or complete airway obstruction on EMS arrival.10 A pro-
portion of these patients will respond to basic maneuvers, and those who do not usu-
ally have more severe, less survivable injuries. This observation in part explains the
comparatively poor survival rates for trauma patients who are intubated in the preho-
spital setting.
Airway Management in Patients with Suspected Cervical Spine Injuries
Trauma resuscitations typically proceed under the assumption that the patient has an
unstable cervical spine (c-spine) injury until proven otherwise. In the prehospital envi-
ronment, trauma patients are often placed in a cervical spine collar and secured to a
rigid backboard with blocks. Although a long-standing tradition in emergency medi-
cine and trauma care, there is very limited published evidence to support the notion
that cervical spine collars and immobilization prevent secondary spinal cord
injury.28,29 Although the incidence of c-spine injuries is relatively low (occurring in
approximately 2% in the general trauma population and 6%–8% in patients with
head and facial trauma), practitioners often operate with deep concern that intubation
may cause secondary spinal cord injury, making it one of the most frequently encoun-
tered reasons for difficulty in trauma airway management.30–33
Management pearls for the patient with traumatic brain injury (TBI)
� Hypoxemia and hypotension during airway management significantly worsens outcomes in
patients with TBI.
� Airway management for airway protection should proceed only after adequate measures
have been taken to prevent intubation related physiologic disturbances.
� Postintubation hypocapnia is also associated with poor outcomes in patients with TBI and
often the result of adrenaline induced overzealous postintubation ventilation.
� Postinjury apnea requiring ventilation support does not necessarily predict poor outcome.
Kovacs & Sowers

 A frequently studied outcome is the amount of translational or angular movement of
the cervical spine caused by airway manipulation. Although it appears that spinal
movement occurs to a variable degree depending on the airway technique used, it
is unclear whether or not this results in any important differences in clinical out-
comes.34 In cadaveric studies of unstable c-spine injuries, movement occurring with
both direct laryngoscopy (DL) and indirect laryngoscopy do not significantly exceed
the physiologic values observed with intact spines.35,36 Despite the need to be
cautious, even in patients with known cervical spine injuries, secondary neurologic
deterioration is rare, with a reported incidence of 0.03%.33,37–39
Trauma patients with suspected spinal injury are typically fully supine, inhibiting the
practitioner’s ability to optimally position the patient for DL. Manual inline stabilization
(MILS) worsens the view obtained with DL in up to 50% of cases.40 Minimizing chal-
lenges with laryngoscopy and intubation mandates proper application of MILS,
whereby the provider tasked with this role immobilizes the head and neck without
immobilizing the mandible (Fig. 1). C-spine collars and improperly applied MILS will
restrict mouth opening and tongue and mandibular displacement required for optimal
laryngoscopy. Despite properly applied MILS, the provider should still expect a higher
occurrence of a poor view with DL, longer intubation times, and more frequent failed
intubation attempts.40 This scenario is often easily managed by applying external
laryngeal manipulation or use of a bougie.
Another theoretic concern is that application of MILS results in the need for an
increased applied force during laryngoscopy, which paradoxically may lead to more
movement during intubation than occurs without MILS.40,41 Recognizing our inability
to correct the fundamental geometric challenge of DL, the provider may opt to use a
“look-around-the-corner” indirect device, such as a video laryngoscope with a hyper-
angulated blade. The 3 classes of video laryngoscopes are described in Box 1.42
It would seem intuitive that because indirect hyperangulated video laryngoscopy
(VL) consistently provides an improved glottic view and that c-spine immobilization
consistently impairs the glottic view with DL, that VL is the better choice for trauma
patients.43–45 However, having a good view with VL does not mean that easy ETI
will follow.46 When using a hyperangulated video laryngoscope, a deliberate restricted
view may be desired to facilitate the often seemingly frustrating paradox of having a
great view of the glottis but not being able to deliver the ETT.42,46,47

 Literature comparing intubation devices in c-spine immobilized patients has yielded
inconsistent findings, and no consensus as to the optimal approach.38,44,45,48,49 A
recent meta-analysis by Suppan and colleagues45 reported more failed intubations
for DL compared with several alternative intubating devices in patients with c-spine
immobilization. Although the investigators acknowledge the weaknesses of available
literature, they note there was no statistically significant difference in first-attempt suc-
cess between the more commonly used VL devices (GlideScope, C-MAC) and DL.45 It
is less likely that there is a “the right device” for the unstable c-spine and more impor-
tant is the right experienced practitioner, using a device with which he or she is the
most comfortable.50,51
Airway management in the patient with a possible c-spine injury must strike a bal-
ance between minimizing movement and the need to quickly and successfully intu-
bate on first attempt, thereby minimizing the harm of hypoxemia that may be
associated with multiple attempts at intubation.52 It seems reasonable to consider
that if the patient’s spinal cord has survived the massive forces of the crash, as well
as repositioning during extrication and immobilization, that the chances that move-
ment occurring during controlled airway management will result in cord injury is
extremely low. As suggested by Aprahamian and colleagues,33,53 the primary benefit
of a rigid cervical collar is to serve as a reminder about the potential existence of an
unstable c-spine injury.
Management pearls for patients with unstable cervical spine injuries
� Imaging should not delay airway management and assume all trauma patients have unstable
cervical spines.
� The provider should optimally use the intubation device he or she is most experienced with.
� Be prepared for a poor view with direct laryngoscopy (DL) and always have a bougie ready
for use.
� Rigid cervical collars must be opened or removed and replaced by properly applied manual
inline stabilization (MILS).
� Properly applied MILS should avoid immobilization of the mandible.
� If using a hyperangulated video laryngoscope, a deliberate restricted glottic view may
facilitate difficult ETT advancement.

 The Contaminated Airway
The presence of airway contamination with either blood or vomitus has been shown to
decrease the rate of first-attempt intubation success, regardless of the device used.54
Blood and vomit in the airway can lead to early and late complications related to diffi-
cult airway management and/or aspiration. The bloody airway is not uncommon in
trauma patients with injuries to the face and/or neck and may range in severity from
scant bleeding, which is easily managed, to significant hemorrhage. The combination
of altered levels of consciousness, diminished protective airway reflexes, delayed
gastric emptying, and full stomachs place trauma patients at high risk of vomiting
and aspiration during airway management. Management of contaminated airway
must begin with the expectation that the degree of blood, vomit, and secretions appre-
ciated externally represents only a fraction of what may be encountered on initiation of
an RSI. As such, providers must ensure that adequate suction is available (at least 2
large rigid suction catheters). Consideration must be given to positioning, placing
the patient in reverse Trendelenburg or, if safe to do so, seated upright or even leaning
forward to allow drainage of blood and secretions. For c-spine immobilized patients,
suction must be immediately within reach, and restraints securing the patient to the
bed should be avoided. During the preoxygenation phase, positive-pressure ventila-
tion (PPV) should be used only if necessary balanced against the patient’s oxygena-
tion status, as ventilatory pressures of 20 cm H2O or more are likely to ventilate the
stomach, increasing the risk of regurgitation and aspiration.
When blood or vomitus is overwhelming suction capabilities, the provider may place
either one rigid suction or an ETT in the upper esophagus to divert the offending con-
taminants. The ETT or rigid suction may then be stabilized to the left of the laryngo-
scope and the second suction used during laryngoscopy in search of the epiglottis
(Fig. 2). Often the epiglottis may be “lifted” (more easily accomplished in a reverse
Trendelenburg) out of the contaminant during laryngoscopy, providing an anatomic
reference for placing a bougie.
Most of the literature comparing DL with VL in the bloody or vomitus-filled airway is
simulation-based, and concern exists about the vulnerability of VL camera lens in the
contaminated airway.55,56 Recently, Sakles and colleagues54 retrospectively reviewed

 more than 4600 intubations and demonstrated that, although airway contamination
was associated with a decreased first-attempt success rate, this was irrespective of
the choice of GlideScope or DL as the first-attempt device used. The use of DL or
Macintosh VL, in which a direct approach can be used if the camera is obscured
with the aid of a bougie, may be preferred approaches.
Although not studied in a clinical setting, the Ducanto suction-assisted laryngos-
copy airway decontamination (SALAD) approach has gained acceptance as a method
to manage the soiled airway.57,58 In the uncommon circumstance in which blood or
vomit is overwhelming these management strategies, intubation is not possible and
the patient is critically desaturating, rescue oxygenation with a BVM (bag-valve-
mask) or SGA (supraglottic airway) is unlikely to work and an FONA approach is
indicated.
The Uncooperative or Agitated Patient
Uncooperative, violent, or agitated patients can encumber adequate assessment,
leading to missed injuries and inadequate resuscitation. Agitation can be multifactorial
and may be the result of head injury, hypoperfusion, hypoxemia, or intoxication. It may
not be clear why a patient is agitated and providers must determine if the patient is
agitated AND injured or agitated BECAUSE the patient is injured.
Ducanto suction-assisted laryngoscopy airway decontamination approach to managing
massive airway contamination
� Use rigid large-bore suction to initially decontaminate
� Perform laryngoscopy keeping blade superior against tongue away from fluid
� Advance suction tip into upper esophagus then wedge in place to left of the laryngoscope
� Use second suction as needed
� Rotate laryngoscope blade 30 degrees to the left to open blade channel
� Place endotracheal tube (ETT), inflate the cuff
Management pearls for the patient with the contaminated airway
� Have at least 2 large-bore rigid suction catheters.
� Consider alternative options for hemorrhage control (sutures, packing, epistaxis kit).
� Minimize positive-pressure ventilation (PPV) and use a monometer for provider feedback
when mask ventilation is indicated.
� Look for epiglottis as an important landmark for glottis and have a bougie prepared for use
with DL.
� If a VL is considered the best option, Macintosh VL may be the preferred device, as it may be
used directly if contamination obstructs camera.
� Consider esophageal ETT diversion connected to suction.
� Suction-assisted laryngoscopy airway decontamination (SALAD) approach.
� If intubation fails and patient is desaturating, front of neck airway (FONA) rescue
oxygenation approach is indicated.

 The EAST guidelines recommend that aggressive behavior refractory to initial phar-
macologic intervention is a discretionary indication for intubation; specifically that if a
patient’s level of agitation prevents assessment and resuscitation, intubation and
sedation should follow.15 Sise and colleagues59 reviewed 1078 trauma patients intu-
bated for discretionary indications (eg, agitation, alcohol intoxication) and found that
62% of patients, once investigated, had a significant head injury. Importantly, there
was no significant difference in complications associated with acute airway manage-
ment in patients intubated for discretionary indications, as compared with those intu-
bated for higher acuity reasons.59
In severely agitated patients, RSI is at times undertaken before optimal hemody-
namic resuscitation and preoxygenation has been achieved. Patients rendered apneic
as part of an RSI without adequate preoxygenation are at high risk of desaturation. The
use of ketamine to facilitate cooperation and allow interventions including preoxyge-
nation has been described as “delayed-sequence intubation” by Weingart and col-
leagues.60 If given slowly, a dissociative intravenous dose of 1 to 1.5 mg/kg poses
little risk of respiratory depression. However, the use of any sedative, particularly in
the presence of other intoxicating ingestions, may inhibit airway reflexes. Concerns
that ketamine may raise intracranial pressure and worsen outcomes in TBI is not sup-
ported by evidence.61,62
Maxillofacial Injuries
Maxillofacial fractures may present dramatically and affect airway management in one
of several ways.63 Posterior displacement from fractured maxillofacial segments may
cause soft tissue collapse and occlude the airway, which may be worsened by the
presence of c-spine collar.64,65 Bleeding may be significant and cause airway man-
agement challenges, as previously discussed. In the supine position, the pooling of
blood in the oropharynx may stimulate a gag response or vomiting, which in turn
may worsen bleeding. Although patients with mandibular fractures in 2 or more loca-
tions may be easier to intubate due to increased mobility of the mandible and attached
soft tissues, associated condylar fractures may cause a mechanical obstruction
limiting mouth opening, making laryngoscopy and intubation difficult.64,66 Maxillofacial
fractures may also cause trismus that may resolve with the neuromuscular blockade;
however, differentiating this from a mechanical obstruction before intubation is
required and is often difficult.
Airway management begins with careful consideration to patient positioning.
Awake, neurologically intact patients without neck pain should be allowed to position
themselves however they are most comfortable to control tissue obstruction and allow
drainage of blood and secretions. They may be given a rigid suction catheter to use
themselves, which is more often tolerated, effective, and less likely to stimulate a
gag and resultant vomiting. Adherence to protocols requiring rigid spinal immobiliza-
tion and supine positioning may result in catastrophe.
Management pearls in the agitated trauma patient
� Agitation may be a symptom of traumatic pathology.
� Agitated patients may require facilitated cooperation to ensure adequate preoxygenation.
� Ketamine is an appropriate agent to facilitate cooperation in agitated patients in
preparation for airway management.
� Always be prepared to provide definitive airway intervention before administering sedation.
Trauma Airway
69
 The provider should presume that preoxygenation in patients with facial trauma may
be difficult, and that reoxygenation with mask ventilation during RSI if the first attempt
is unsuccessful may be difficult or impossible. Distortion of facial structures may make
obtaining a seal with a BVM device difficult and patients may poorly tolerate PPV, as
disruption of tissues may result in worsening bleeding and in cases of associated
lower airway trauma, significant subcutaneous emphysema. Practitioners must pro-
ceed with the assumption that structural collapse of the airway may occur during an
RSI.
The choice of approach is based on the patient’s ability to maintain a patent airway
and their oxygenation status. For a “have no time” scenario (obstructing and hypox-
emic), the primary approach may require a FONA, facilitated by a dissociative keta-
mine dosing. Alternatively, a “double set-up” may be used: RSI with a single
attempt at oral intubation followed immediately by FONA rescue if needed (Fig. 3).
If the patient is maintaining adequate oxygenation, the clinician should proceed with
a focused physical examination to assess the specific pattern of facial injury and plan
accordingly. For example, swelling and tenderness at the temporomandibular joints
suggests the presence of condylar factures and the possibility of mechanical trismus.
Because anticipated difficulty in patients with facial trauma may involve challenges
with intubation, mask ventilation, and possibly supraglottic airway rescue, preserva-
tion of spontaneous respiration during attempts to secure the airway should be
considered. These patients may be best served when feasible by an “awake”
approach with a laryngoscope or flexible intubating endoscope (FIE) or in selected
cases a primary FONA.

 The Traumatized Airway
Airway management for the patient with a primary injury to the larynx or trachea is a
high-stakes scenario, in which the loss of a stable airway can happen rapidly and
with little warning. Suspicion of a traumatized airway should initiate a call for help to
an experienced colleague.
Primary airway trauma is relatively uncommon in the civilian urban setting, with a re-
ported incidence of less than 1% (0.4% for blunt and 4.5% for penetrating injuries).67
Accordingly, practitioners have infrequent or limited experience in managing these pa-
tients and existing management guidelines for care of these patients are mostly based
on expert opinion.68
Clinical findings suggestive of significant laryngotracheal airway injury include
dysphagia, hoarseness, stridor, bleeding in the upper airway, subcutaneous emphy-
sema, expanding hematoma, or in open penetrating injuries, obvious disruption of
the larynx or trachea. If airway injury is suspected, aggressive PPV should be avoided.
PPV in the setting of airway disruption can create or worsen pneumothorax, pneumo-
mediastinum, or subcutaneous emphysema. Massive subcutaneous emphysema can
distort airway anatomy, further complicating management. A potentially catastrophic
complication is the conversion of a partial tracheal transection into a complete tran-
section with the force of blindly passing an ETT or a bougie, particularly if relying on
distal “hold-up” to confirm placement.68,69
For patients with known or suspected airway injury, the safest way to facilitate ETI is
placement of the ETT under direct visualization, ideally from the oropharynx to the ca-
rina using an FIE.68,70 Mercer and colleagues68 described an approach to managing
patients with suspected laryngotracheal injury (Fig. 4). In the “have time” scenario in
the patient who is oxygenating with minimal assistance, awake, and cooperative,
the airway can be approached either from above after adequate topicalization, using
a FIE, or infraglottically with a FONA approach (most commonly an awake tracheos-
tomy) depending on the location of the injury.
Careful titration of ketamine is often desirable to improve comfort and cooperation
while maintaining airway reflexes. Use of an FIE allows both a diagnostic and thera-
peutic advantage: visualizing the specific pattern of injury, and facilitating careful
ETT placement, while avoiding conversion to a complete transection. If an area of par-
tial injury is identified, the FIE can be advanced distally and used as a guide to ensure
safe advancement of the ETT beyond the site of injury.
In a “have no time” situation with a deteriorating patient in whom an RSI is consid-
ered the only viable option, a double set-up is mandatory, recognizing that the level of
airway breach will influence whether FONA can occur through the cricothyroid mem-
brane or if a tracheostomy is required. One option to improve visual navigation past
the airway injury is to use a VL-assisted flexible endoscopic intubation.71 In this
Management pearls for the patient with facial injuries
� These patients require careful assessment of damaged anatomy recognizing the unique
airway complications associated with facial fractures.
� Both laryngoscopy and mask ventilation may be challenging and a double set-up should be
prepared for when rapid sequence intubation (RSI) is the chosen approach.
� An awake approach, although not always practical, should be considered.
� Management of aggressive bleeding should be anticipated.
� Allow patients to assume a position of comfort when safe to do so.

 scenario, an RSI is initiated in the usual fashion and a VL is used to control soft tissues
and obtain a view of the glottic inlet. A flexible intubating endoscope is then advanced
through the vocal cords with the visual aid of VL distally to the carina facilitating in-
spection of the airway, and the ETT is advanced over the FIE into position.
THE AWAKE INTUBATION
A successful awake intubation is dependent on careful patient selection, and, in
particular, identifying anatomic, pathologic, or physiologic features that would make
RSI problematic. There are several specific patient populations, including the burn

Management pearls for the patient with a primary airway injury
� Decompensation in the patient with a traumatized airway may be rapid and catastrophic.
� PPV should be avoided if possible.
� An awake approach with appropriate topicalization is the preferred approach.
� If an RSI is chosen, a double set-up with a FONA plan for accessing the trachea based on the
level of the airway breach.

 patient and the patient with penetrating neck injuries, in whom an awake intubation
may be the approach of choice, as a strategy to mitigate both predicted difficulty
and anticipated dynamic changes in airway anatomy and physiology.
The awake intubation is a “have time” approach, involving placement of an ETT
following adequate topicalization in a patient who is able to maintain spontaneous res-
pirations. It is not device-specific and can be performed using DL, VL, or an FIE. Suc-
cess with awake intubation is dependent on meticulous airway topicalization, and in
general requires an awake and cooperative patient.72,73 The use of sedation is not
routine, and has been associated with increased awake intubation failures.74 Specif-
ically, sedation should never be used in place of adequate airway topicalization. A diffi-
cult airway paradox exists here: patients identified as difficult are selected to undergo a
technically more challenging awake approach, a procedure that is performed infre-
quently by most emergency physicians. There is no simple answer to this resource, skill
availability dilemma. It is our opinion that physicians who are responsible for acute
airway management should acquire and maintain the skills required for awake intuba-
tion, as it can be a lifesaving approach in a specific subset of dynamic airway situations.
RAPID SEQUENCE INTUBATION
RSI involves the rapid administration of an induction agent and a neuromuscular
blocking agent in quick succession to facilitate ETT placement in a patient who is pre-
sumed to have a full stomach. RSI is the most common approach for airway manage-
ment in trauma.75,76 Oxygenation with or without ventilation during the procedure
(referred to by some as a “modified” RSI) is considered standard by most acute
care practitioners.77–79 Historically, the application of cricoid pressure (CP) to prevent
passive aspiration has been considered an essential component of an RSI. However,
its routine use remains controversial, with some evidence suggesting it may make
various aspects of airway management more challenging. If cricoid pressure is being
applied and the practitioner experiences difficulty with laryngoscopy, intubation, or
ventilation, CP should be immediately discontinued.80,81
Hemodynamic instability and hypoxemia must be aggressively managed before
attempting RSI.22,23 The “rapid” part of an RSI refers to the delivery of the induction
drug and neuromuscular blocking agent, and is not meant to imply a hurried or rushed
process. RSI in underresuscitated patients may result in unintended poor outcomes,
including critical hypoxemia and circulatory collapse.82,83 The term “resuscitative
sequence intubation” has been suggested as a more representative term used to
describe the preparation and optimization of the patient’s physiologic status before
definitive airway management.84
Preparation
Numerous preparatory airway acronyms and checklists have been proposed to
reduce errors and adverse events associated with RSI.85,86 Although evidence of
outcome benefit may be lacking, based on an increased understanding of the role
of human factors in contributing to adverse airway outcomes, it seems a reasonable
recommendation that an airway checklist be used in the preparation phase of trauma
airway management.87–91 In general, checklists should be simple, use terminology
that is clearly understood by the entire team, and can be performed rapidly (Fig. 5).
Optimizing Hemodynamics
Hemodynamic instability in trauma is most commonly caused by hypovolemia due to
hemorrhage. Intravascular depletion shifts the gradient between right atrial pressure
Trauma Airway
73
 and mean systemic pressure, reducing preload and subsequently mean arterial pres-
sure. The transition to PPV, either through a closed system BVM with an attached with
positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) valve or with mechanical ventilation once
intubated, abruptly increases the intrathoracic pressure, further shifting this gradient.
Postintubation hypotension is defined as a systolic blood pressure (SBP) <90 mm
Hg or a mean arterial pressure <65 mm Hg within 30 minutes of intubation.92 Inade-
quate resuscitation of hemorrhagic shock, transition to PPV, loss of sympathetic drive
associated with general anesthesia, and the hemodynamic effect of many induction
drugs are all contributing factors. The incidence of post intubation hypotension is
high in patients requiring emergency airway management (23%–46%), which is impor-
tant because even transient drops in blood pressure are associated with adverse out-
comes in trauma patients.23,92–94 Patients with a shock index (defined as heart rate
divided by SBP) of greater than 0.8 are at particular risk of developing significant hy-
potension in the postintubation period.82,95,96 The combination of hypoxemia and hy-
potension is additive, with an adjusted odds of death double that of the increased
mortality associated with either event alone.23,97,98
Early use of blood products is recommended when the etiology of shock in trauma is
believed to be from hemorrhage. Vasopressors have traditionally been avoided in
trauma based on concerns that they may worsen bleeding. During the peri-
intubation phase, early aggressive use of blood products and hemorrhage control mea-
sures (splinting, pelvic binding) should remain the mainstay of resuscitation efforts.
Careful use of vasopressors should be strongly considered in at-risk head-injured

 patients to prevent or manage postintubation hypotension. Sustained vasopressor use
by infusion beyond the immediate peri-intubation period may be required to mitigate
the effects of PPV, postparalysis sedation, and ongoing losses unresponsive to fluid
and blood product replacement.
All commonly used induction agents will cause hypotension, particularly when a full
dose is administered to a volume-constricted patient. Dosage recommendations for
RSI induction agents are largely based on patients without hemodynamic instability.
As such, in trauma patients with hypotension or a shock index greater than 0.8, it
seems prudent that the dose of the induction agent be reduced by at least
50%.83,91,95,99 In North America, etomidate has been the most commonly used induc-
tion agent used for RSI. Owing to the association between using etomidate and adre-
nal suppression, many institutions have moved to alternative induction agents.1,100
With a favorable hemodynamic profile and strong analgesic effect, ketamine is quickly
becoming the preferred induction agent for trauma patients.100 A study comparing
standard full-dose ketamine with etomidate in trauma patients showed no survival
benefit of one agent over the other.100 In light of this, it is probably true to suggest
that the dose of the drug is more important than the choice of drug.
Paralysis should have no direct effect on the patient’s hemodynamic status, and in
hypoperfused states their dose should be increased. There is some debate regarding
which neuromuscular blocking agent is superior for an RSI: both succinylcholine and
rocuronium may be safely used and can provide good intubating conditions.101 It
should be emphasized, however, that administering too small a dose (<1.0 mg/kg)
of rocuronium, particularly in low-flow states, will result in inadequate intubating con-
ditions and a larger dose is recommended (1.2–1.6 mg/kg).101,102 Although clinicians
may be weary of the prolonged effect of high-dose rocuronium in potentially difficult
airway cases, extended, deep paralysis is in fact desirable in this circumstance, as
it helps to create optimal conditions for laryngoscopy, BVM and SGA ventilation,
and FONA. Having the sick trauma patient wake up to a state that he or she will be
able rescue his or her own airway is simply not realistic, and will make efforts to secure
the airway even more difficult.
Avoiding Hypoxemia
Hypoxemia during emergency department (ED) RSI is common, occurring in more
than one-third of cases.24 Proceeding with an RSI in a patient who is already hypox-
emic can result in catastrophic complications. Patients with preintubation oxygen sat-
urations of less than 95% are at risk of abrupt desaturation within 90 seconds of the
onset of apnea.103 Although recent literature has focused on extending safe apnea
time with passive high-flow nasal oxygenation (HFNO) with or without noninvasive
ventilation, the most important determinant of time to desaturation remains preoxyge-
nation status.104
Although high oxygen saturation is reassuring, it is not a true measurement of oxy-
gen reserve. Furthermore, oxygen saturation alone provides little information about
Management of peri-intubation hemodynamic instability
� Resuscitation using blood products (packed red blood cells/massive transfusion) should be
done early in the preintubation phase of trauma management.

 the true safe apnea time, which is defined by the relationship between oxygen reserve
and the rate of oxygen consumption. Effective management of the preoxygenation
phase requires both increasing the patient’s oxygen reserve while simultaneously
decreasing the rate of oxygen consumption through aggressive resuscitation.
Increasing the oxygen reserve has 3 components: denitrogenation of the lungs,
recruitment of alveoli with PEEP, and apneic oxygenation.
Denitrogenation is the primary physiologic mechanism of preoxygenation and is
dependent on delivery of a high concentration of oxygen, resulting in a 10-fold in-
crease available oxygen. Increased functional residual capacity (FRC) provides an
ongoing reservoir to keep hemoglobin saturated. Delivery of close to 100% oxygen
for approximately 4 minutes is required to denitrogenate normal lungs and may be
most easily accomplished with high-flow, “flush-rate” (40 LPM) oxygen using a con-
ventional non-rebreather mask.105 In patients with a high minute ventilation or shunt
physiology, a closed system BVM with a PEEP valve and a tight-fitting mask is the
preferred preoxygenation technique. If respiratory effort support is required, this is
best achieved using a mechanical (NIV) as opposed to manual ventilator (BVM).
With atelectasis, pulmonary contusion, and other lung pathologies, the FRC is
diminished and the resultant shunt physiology renders preoxygenation with a high
FiO2 less effective in preventing desaturation.106–108 Alveolar recruitment using an ox-
ygen delivery device with PEEP is necessary to help mitigate the negative effects of
shunt physiology. A PEEP valve should be considered standard when using a BVM
for preoxygenation, as it will prevent entrainment in BVMs without a dedicated expira-
tory valve. A PEEP valve attached to a BVM and applied over conventional nasal
prongs at high flow (�15 LPM) in a spontaneously breathing patient will produce
continuous positive airway pressure–like conditions. Assisted ventilations are best
delivered using a dedicated noninvasive ventilator; however, can be performed with
the same BVM/PEEP, nasal cannula combination. It is advisable to use a pressure
manometer attached to the BVM when using this combination to minimize high pres-
sures that may result in gastric distention and aspiration.
Alveolar oxygen delivery that continues without respiratory effort is referred to as
apneic oxygenation (AO). AO is facilitated by the pressure gradient between the
oropharynx and the alveoli created by the differential uptake of oxygen and delivery
of CO2 to and from the alveoli, resulting in the passive transfer of oxygen.104,107 By
continuously replenishing the FRC oxygen stores, apneic oxygenation using conven-
tional or specialized nasal prongs to administer high-flow oxygen (10–70 LPM) may
extend the safe apnea time after an RSI.103,104 Numerous studies have evaluated to
effectiveness of HFNO as an adjunct to preoxygenation for RSI, and the balance of ev-
idence suggest the procedure as both safe and effective.104
Of note, the ability to extend the safe apnea time must not allow providers to
become cavalier and should not encourage prolonged intubation attempts.106,109 By
the time peripheral oxygen saturation begins to fall, cerebral hypoxemia has already
occurred, a phenomenon known as “pulse-ox lag.”103 Effective situation awareness
is required, even (and perhaps especially) when supporting gas exchange by way of
passive oxygenation, to stay within the “safe apnea” zone.
Preoxygenation: “the rule of 2s”
� Elevate the head (ear to sternum) and the bed greater than 20� (reverse Trendelenburg).
� Two sources of oxygen for all critically ill patients: high-flow nasal prongs �15 L/min and
NRB/bag-mask ventilation �15 L/min.
� Two approaches for obstruction: OPA with a jaw thrust for soft tissue obstruction.

 FRONT OF NECK AIRWAY TO SECURE THE AIRWAY
Numerous methods are used to access the trachea infraglottically, and the terminol-
ogy describing the procedure is as variable as the techniques available to do so.
Perhaps most accurate is the new term “front of neck airway” (FONA), which elimi-
nates ambiguous verbiage like “surgical airway” or “airway rescue.”110 Although
rare (0.05%–1.7% of ED-based intubations), the decision to perform FONA must
begin during the initial assessment of the patient’s airway, long before the “cannot
intubate cannot oxygenate” (CICO) scenario is encountered.111 This begins with a
pre-procedure briefing with team members to define clear triggers for moving ahead
with the procedure. Palpation of the anterior neck, and perhaps even marking the
anticipated location of the cricothyroid membrane should be done routinely for all
emergency airway cases and equipment should be both familiar to team members
and immediately available.
Cognitive and team-based preparation is vital, as the decision to proceed with a
FONA is often delayed until critical hypoxemia has occurred.111 It is widely speculated
that the most significant delay is often the result of hesitant decision-making and a
reluctance to perform a rarely encountered procedure.112 Open discussion of the
emergency surgical airway as a potential outcome familiarizes the team and normalizes
the procedure, shifting from the negative connotation of the “failed airway” to the
recognition of the ultimately inevitable surgical airway.113 By normalizing the proced-
ure, at least cognitively, we aim to reduce the psychological distress associated with it.
No specific oxygen saturation level should be used as a trigger to perform FONA,
recognizing that a failed oxygenation situation is dynamic and characterized by a
rapidly falling oxygen saturation despite maximal efforts to reoxygenate the patient.111
Failed intubation followed by difficult mask ventilation with falling saturations repre-
sents an impending FONA that should be initiated after a single rescue attempt with
supraglottic airway device. In rare situations, FONA may be the first and only invasive
airway technique attempted, even in the setting of normal oxygen saturation; for
example, massive facial trauma disrupting all recognizable airway landmarks. This
“surgically inevitable” airway needs to be identified and declared early, such that
time is not wasted on fruitless efforts to intubate “from above.”
There are several options for the emergency FONA and there remains some contro-
versy regarding the preferred approach. Historically, methods such as transtracheal
jet ventilation and percutaneous cricothyroidotomy with a Seldinger technique, have
been advocated. However, recent reviews have shown that complications associated
with jet ventilation are unacceptably high and wire-guided approaches are not as easy
or successful as once believed.114–117
There has been a recent push to adopt a modified open technique using a scalpel,
finger, and bougie (the “scalpel-bougie” technique). The 2015 Difficult Airway Society
� Two attachments for your BVM: positive end-expiratory pressure valve and pressure
manometer.
� Two hands on all face masks: to ensure closed system oxygenation and ventilation and
perform an aggressive jaw thrust.
� Two providers: the most experienced obtaining a tight mask seal and aggressive jaw thrust
giving feedback to the provider squeezing the bag to avoid overventilation and
hyperventilation.

 guidelines recommend that all clinicians responsible for airway management be able
to perform a FONA, and that the scalpel-bougie technique is the technique of
choice.89 The scalpel-bougie technique has several advantages for the emergency
clinician: it relies on gross motor skills (which are more likely to be preserved during
periods of acute stress), uses familiar equipment (scalpel, bougie, and a #6 ETT),
and has a minimal number of steps.
The body of evidence for this rarely needed procedure is (and will likely remain)
limited, yet all clinicians need to be mentally and technically prepared to rapidly
perform front of neck access to secure the airway. Success for high-acuity, low-op-
portunity events like this requires frequent, deliberate practice using simulation.118
FONA trainers need not be expensive or complicated; motor habit can be developed
using simple models with Venturi oxygen tubing or an empty roll of bathroom tissue.
SUMMARY
Effective trauma care requires a team approach, with resuscitation priorities clearly
communicated and interventions guided by the physiologic priorities that ensure
adequate oxygen delivery. Although ensuring oxygenation and ventilation are prior-
ities, airway management as the technical imperative of putting the “tube in the
hole” must not overshadow other resuscitative elements.
Providing advanced airway management is part of the A and B and C parallel resus-
citative priorities of trauma care. Safely managing both the anticipated and unantici-
pated difficult airway requires technical expertise; however, decisions of when and
how to intervene are equally important determinants of outcome. Airway management
in trauma begins as soon as patient contact is made and rarely starts with placement
of an ETT. Gaining intravenous access, beginning fluid resuscitation, and applying ox-
ygen may be lifesaving and/or bridging interventions that allow for the safe execution
of downstream more definitive procedures. Whether the team is a doctor, nurse, and
transporting paramedics or a group of 10, success is dependent on a shared under-
standing of the importance of resuscitation before intubation and clear communica-
tion of what and when various airway interventions will be performed. Then,
securing the airway will have the best chance of making a positive difference in trauma
patient outcomes.
