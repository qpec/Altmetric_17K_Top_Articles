Crocodiles Alter Skin Color in 
Response to Environmental Color 
Conditions
Mark Merchant1, Amber Hale2, Jen Brueggen3, Curt Harbsmeier4 & Colette Adams5
Many species alter skin color to varying degrees and by different mechanisms. Here, we show that 
some crocodylians modify skin coloration in response to changing light and environmental conditions. 
Within the Family, Crocodylidae, all members of the genus Crocodylus lightened substantially when 
transitioned from dark enclosure to white enclosures, whereas Mecistops and Osteolaemus showed 
little/no change. The two members of the Family Gavialidae showed an opposite response, lightening 
under darker conditions, while all member of the Family Alligatoridae showed no changes. Observed 
color changes were rapid and reversible, occurring within 60–90 minutes. The response is visually-
mediated and modulated by serum α
-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α
-MSH), resulting in 
redistribution of melanosomes within melanophores. Injection of crocodiles with α
-MSH caused the 
skin to lighten. These results represent a novel description of color change in crocodylians, and have 
important phylogenetic implications. The data support the inclusion of the Malayan gharial in the 
Family Gavialidae, and the shift of the African slender-snouted crocodile from the genus Crocodylus to 
the monophyletic genus Mecistops.
The rapid alteration of skin color is well known among a wide assortment of ectothermic vertebrates and inver-
tebrates1. Adaptive skin color changes may occur for a variety of reasons, including communication, thermal 
regulation, and crypsis1. The modification of skin pigmentation is achieved by either physiological or morpho-
logical mechanisms1. Physiological color change is typically influenced by changes in circulating hormone levels, 
that is in turn, controlled by neurological stimuli2, and the molecular mechanisms have been studied in detail3. 
Morphological color change, described in teleost fish4, amphibians5, and reptiles6, is generally slower, and involves 
changes in both the density and morphology of melanophores7.
Color change for the purposes of communication, as described by Korzan et al.8, may signal dominance, 
aggression, or reproductive state9,10. Color change in ectothermic vertebrates may also function to enhance ther-
moregulatory ability11, a phenomenon that has been documented in lizards12–14 and toads15. The change of skin 
color to match environment is typically used for camouflage to either avoid predation or aid in foraging suc-
cess1. Numerous ectotherms across a broad spectrum of taxa6,16 including invertebrates (crustaceans and ceph-
alopods)17–19, and vertebrates (fishes, amphibians, and reptiles)20–22 utilize color change for crypsis. Rapid and 
complex alterations in skin color have been well-documented in cuttlefish, squid, octopuses23 and insects1. In 
addition, several classes of vertebrates have been shown to adapt body shading in response to environmental 
color changes. Chameleons1, anoles24, frogs25–29 and fish21 alter skin color in response to environmental changes.
Crocodylians were first reported to alter skin colors with respect to their backgrounds in 198530. Saltwater 
crocodile (Crocodylus porosus) hatchlings developed a dark or light color when raised in dark or light tanks, 
respectively, for three months. These same animals reverted to the opposite color three weeks after being placed 
in a tank of opposite color. Since crocodylian hatchlings and small juveniles typically experience high rates of 
predation in the wild, and only a small percentage of young survive to adulthood31,32, the ability to adapt to dif-
ferent environments may be a key to avoid predation. In addition, since crocodylians are slow, methodic, stalking 
hunters, the ability to alter skin color to match surroundings would certainly aid in predation33.

Here we report the varying abilities of all 24 species of extant crocodylians to alter skin coloration in response 
to environmental light conditions, as well as the physiological mechanism that regulates color change in the genus 
Crocodylus. The ability to alter skin color, and type of alteration, is strongly divided along phylogenetic lines.
Results and Discussion
Most members of the Family Crocodylidae, and all members of the genus Crocodylus, exhibited alteration of skin 
color in response to background conditions (Fig. 1A). Crocodylids lighten the dorsolateral skin surfaces in light 
backgrounds and darken them in darker ones, but the ventral surface of crocodylids does not change color in 
response to environmental changes. In contrast, members of the Family Alligatoridae exhibit little or no ability to 
alter skin color in differing light conditions (Fig. 1B). These data suggest that development of the ability to change 
color with changing background conditions occurred after the split of these two families, approximately 80 mil-
lion years ago34 (Fig. 2). The only two extant members of the Family Crocodylidae, which are not included in the 
genus Crocodylus, the African dwarf crocodile (Osteolaemus tetraspis) and the African slender-snouted crocodile 
(Mecistops cataphractus), showed little/no ability to change color. This implies that the common ancestor to the 
genus Crocodylus developed the capability to alter skin color after 30–40 mya (when the common ancestor for 
these two species split from the genus Crocodylus) and prior to 12–17 mya, when a rapid divergence of the genus 
Crocodylus occurred (Fig. 2). Alternatively, but a less likely scenario, is that the common ancestor to the Family 
Crocodylidae was able to change color, but the common ancestor to M. cataphractus and O. tetraspsis lost this abil-
ity after they diverged from the genus Crocodylus, but before the further divergence into separate species (Fig. 2).
Social interactions are known to influence skin coloration in some taxa of lizards1,30 and fish35. Since many 
crocodylian species live in communal populations, the chance for social interactions could potentially affect the 
results of color change studies. It is important to note that the color changes described in this study were induced 
in animals housed alone in individual tanks, and thus social interactions should not have influenced the results.
The two members of the Family Gavialidae, Tomistoma schlegelii and Gavialis gangeticus exhibited responses 
that were opposite of those demonstrated by members of the genus Crocodylus, yet similar in magnitude. Gharials 
responded to increased light with darkening of the dorsolateral skin surfaces (Fig. 1C). As mentioned, the ventral

surface of the crocodylids did not change color, while juvenile Malaysian gharials respond to visible light with 
ventral darkening (Fig. 1C).
Maximum color change was achieved two hours after moving animals from white to dark colored enclosures, 
as demonstrated using Philippine crocodiles (C. mindorensis; Fig. 3A). After placement of the animals back into 
the white tank, the skin color reverted back to a lighter color. These changes occurred more quickly than the 
changes described by Kirshner30. The drastic alteration of skin color is visible to the unaided eye, as shown in pairs 
of sibling Philippine (Fig. 3B) and Morelet’s (C. moreletii, Fig. 3C) crocodiles, with one being held in a white tank 
for three hours and the other in a dark tank for the same time period. This relatively rapid change in skin color is 
indicative of a hormonally-controlled physiological response2,3.
To determine if the mechanism by which light exposure influences skin color in crocodylids was physiological 
or morphological, the eyes of several Philippine crocodiles, maintained in light color environments, were taped 
such that no light could penetrate the eyes (Fig. 4A). Although the animals were placed back into their white 
environments, their skin darkened substantially within two hours. The change in skin color was similar to results 
obtained when the same animals were removed from white tanks and placed in black tanks without tape over 
their eyes. In addition, the movement of the crocodiles from white tanks to black tanks that were flooded with 
additional light resulted in only minimal darkening of the skin (Fig. 4A). Similarly, Philippine crocodiles placed 
in white tanks and maintained under low-light conditions exhibited dark skin tones. These results suggest that 
ocular stimulation with light plays a key role in the induction of color change. The black tanks absorb most of the 
light and reduce the amount of luminance reaching the animal’s eyes. Likewise, in a white tank, more indirect 
light is reflected toward the animals, resulting in more ocular stimulation and lighter skin color.
Keeble and Gamble36 proposed that the control of skin tone was dependent on albedo, the ratio of reflected 
light to direct light that reaches the eye. This implies that polarized light, which is more abundant in reflected 
light, might have a role in color change, and would also explain why flooding a black tank with higher intensity 
light does not cause the maximal color change effect (Fig. 4A), since the direct light is less effective and dark tank 
does not effectively reflect light to the animal.
Exposure to increased light intensity resulted in enhanced skin lightening in both Philippine and Morelet’s 
crocodiles (Fig. 4B). The results show that the Philippine crocodile was more sensitive to low light, and exhibited 
significant color changes at light intensities as low as 400 lux (neck and flank), while the tail and head responded 
with significant change at 800 lux (Fig. 4B). Similarly, the neck and flank regions of Morelet’s crocodiles exhib-
ited color change at 500 lux, but the head and tail areas did not respond until 1750 lux. These results could 
be due to different amounts of melanophores in the skin of these crocodiles in different regions of the body. 
Alternatively, Philippine crocodiles might respond to lower light intensities with the production of higher levels 
of α
-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α
MSH). A combination of these and other factors is also possible.
Illumination of Morelet’s crocodiles with light of different spectral properties results in variable intensity of 
changes in skin color (Fig. 4C). We employed spectral filters to allow specific ranges of wavelengths to reach the 
animals. Exposure of these crocodiles to low energy light at the red end of the visible spectrum (500–700 nm,

Fig. 4C) elicited minimal response. However, light of shorter wavelengths (350–450 nm) produced a much 
stronger response. Saltwater (C. porosus) and Australian freshwater (C. johnsonii) crocodiles have cone photo-
receptors which absorb light at 424 and 426 nm, respectively37. Since the wavelength of light for these photore-
ceptors closely match the energy for light that stimulates this response, it is reasonable to expect that they may 
facilitate this physiological response.
Because crocodylians are ectothermic vertebrates, temperature is always a concern in experimental design, 
and adding light to an environment can increase temperature, thus influencing results. The results obtained from 
constant temperature experiments, during which only light was increased, suggest that the reported color change 
is not caused by changes in thermal environment (Fig. 4B). In addition, other mechanistic experiments, during 
which color changes were induced by simply taping the eyes (Fig. 4A), occurred at constant temperature. Due 
to experimental design, it is clear that changes in temperature are not responsible for these modifications in skin 
coloration.
Many vertebrates induce changes in skin color by increasing concentrations of circulating hormones. Changes 
in circulating α
MSH have been linked to skin color changes in frogs38, lizards2, and fish39. The results in Fig. 5A 
show that members of the genus Crocodylus express α
MSH at low levels when adapted to dark tanks, but at much 
higher concentrations when acclimated to lighter environments. Members of the Family Alligatoridae, which 
do not change color (Fig. 1B), also do not express differential levels of α
MSH in response to environmental light 
changes (Fig. 5A). In crocodylids, the changes in circulating α
MSH correlate well with the changes in both neck 
and flank skin color (Fig. 5B). There is a linear relationship between the change in the amount of plasma α
MSH 
and the change in skin color. This provides strong evidence that the increased in expression of α
MSH is linked to 
physiological changes in skin color in response to environmental light conditions.
The ultrastructure and cellular content of crocodylian skin was first described by Spearman and Riley40. 
Crocodylian skin contains a variety of pigment cells distributed throughout various layers41. The areas that are 
lighter in color exhibit sparse distributions of melanophores, while the black areas have two heavily-populated 
layers, one apical (epidermal) and another more basal (dermal). The data shown in Fig. 6A show that, in croco-
diles conditioned to light tanks, the pigment organelles (melanosomes) inside the melanophores are condensed 
in the body of the cell. Under light conditions, when the melanosomes are concentrated in the body of the cell, 
the cells appear to be lighter in color and smaller, causing the skin to appear lighter. In contrast, when animals are 
acclimated to a dark environment, the pigment is distributed into the long cellular processes of the melanophores. 
Not only is the melanin expanded laterally, but is also spread upward toward the apical surface of the skin, making 
the yellow portions of the skin appear darker.

Stress-induced and corticosteroid-mediated interactions influence a broad spectrum of physiological and 
biochemical parameters in crocodylians42,43. Although stress from handling and restraint could have influenced 
the color changes observed in this study, the data suggest that the observed effects are not caused by stress. For 
instance, when the crocodylians were handled and restrained for this study, we measured increases in serum 
corticosteroid levels (Fig. 6C). When animals were placed in dark tanks and skin darkening was measured, corti-
costeroid levels were increased. However, when the animals were placed back in white tanks and the skins became 
lighter (Fig. 1A), the elevated corticosteroid levels persisted, and thus there was no correlation between steroid 
levels and color change. In other experiments (Fig. 3C), animals were handled and placed back into their same 
color environments and corticosteroid levels increased over time with no commensurate change in skin color. 
Changes in the distribution of melanosomes within the melanophores did not correlate with corticosteroid levels 
(Fig. 6C), but did correlate with plasma α
MSH levels and light exposure (Fig. 5B).
Conclusions
The color change response showed clear divisions along crocodylian phylogenetic lines (Fig. 1). While these data 
alone cannot be used as a metric for the determination of taxonomic relationships, they are supportive of the 
current accepted phylogeny (Fig. 2). Members of the genus Crocodylus respond relatively rapidly to ocular light 
stimulation, while other members of the Family Crocodylidae and all members of the Family Alligatoridae do not 
respond in this manner. This response most likely developed to allow the common ancestor to the members of the 
genus Crocodylus to evade predators when they are young, by blending with background color. In addition, this 
adaptation would have given an advantage to feeding adults. The absence of color change response by the dwarf 
crocodile and slender-snouted crocodile, as compared to all other extant members of the Family Crocodylidae 
(Fig. 2), supports the removal of the slender-snouted crocodile from the genus Crocodylus and the generation of 
the monophyletic genus Mecistops44. In addition, the data support the potential for the slender-snouted crocodile 
and dwarf crocodile as an outgroup to the genus Crocodylus with a common ancestor45 (Fig. 2). Members of the

Family Gavialidae exhibit a similar, but opposite effect. Gharial skin coloration darkens when exposed to light 
environments, and lightens in darker environments. This is likely an adaptation to aid in crypsis, similar to the 
countershading response described in fish46–48.
There has been much speculation concerning whether the Malayan gharial (Tomistoma schlegelii) should be 
placed in Family Crocodylidae or Gavialidae. While the morphological information collected from paleontolog-
ical and comparative anatomical studies place the Malayan gharial within the Crocodyloidea49,50, the molecular 
data sets clearly place the it in the Family Gavialidae. The data presented in this study (Fig. 1) support the inclu-
sion of the Malayan gharial in the Family Gavialidae, as a sister taxon to the Indian gharial51–53 (Fig. 2).
Methods
Treatment of Animals. 
Because the animals used in this study were housed in a broad spectrum of zoo 
facilities and private collections, they were maintained in tanks of various dimensions and were fed different

diets. Blood was collected from the spinal vein as previously described54 using 23 ga. needles and 5 mL syringes. 
All of the methods utilized in this study were approved by the McNeese State University Animal Care and Use 
Committee, and when necessary, institutional ACUC protocols were approved. In addition, all of the proce-
dures were conducted such that they were in accordance with the permissions and approvals granted by these 
institutions.
Measurement of skin color. 
Brightness of crocodylian skin was measured using a Konica-Minolta CR-410 
chromameter. The instrument was calibrated prior to every use. The instrument was held perpendicular to the 
skin surface, and the reflective color (L*a*b*)55 measured as the skin reflected the flash from a xenon bulb. 
During the flash, extraneous light was blocked from the skin surface with an aluminum hood. The L* term 
was used to measure lightness of the skin, on a gray scale from 0 (black) to 100 (white). The same person (M. 
Merchant) collected all of the crocodylian skin measurements for this entire study.
Different light intensities to which crocodylians were exposed was measured using a Sinotech digital illumi-
nance meter, and expressed in lux. Animals were exposed to each intensity for two hours, at which time changes 
to the skin color had stabilized. Spectral filters were used to determine the effects of different wavelength ranges. 
The plastic filters were taped to the bulb such that different wavelength ranges were filtered. The illuminance 
meter was used to adjust the light intensities such that they were the same for all treatment groups.
α
-melanocyte stimulating (α
MSH) hormone assay. 
Plasma α
MSH levels were determined by com-
petitive enzyme-linked immunoassay (Lifespan Biosciences, Inc., Seattle, WA, USA) directed toward human 
α
MSH, according the instructions provided by the manufacturer. Crocodylian α
MSH shares 100% amino acid 
sequence identity with the human protein.
Crocodylian skin histology. 
Punch biopsies (8 mm) were collected from crocodilian skin. Biopsies were 
fixed in formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned to 7 µm, and mounted onto glass slides. The tissues were then 
deparaffinized and cover-slipped without staining. Slides were imaged using a Nikon Eclipse 50i microscope and 
DXM 1200 F digital camera.
