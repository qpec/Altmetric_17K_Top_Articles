Objectives. To understand hospital- and county-level factors for rural obstetric unit
closures, using mixed methods.
Data Sources. Hospital discharge data from Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project’s
Statewide Inpatient Databases, American Hospital Association Annual Survey, and
Area Resource File for 2010, as well as 2013–2014 telephone interviews of all 306 rural
hospitals in nine states with at least 10 births in 2010. Via interview, we ascertained
obstetric unit status, reasons for closures, and postclosure community capacity for pre-
natal care.
Study Design. Multivariate logistic regression and qualitative analysis were used to
identify factors associated with unit closures between 2010 and 2014.
Principal Findings. Exactly 7.2 percent of rural hospitals in the study closed their
obstetric units. These units were smaller in size, more likely to be privately owned, and
located in communities with lower family income, fewer obstetricians, and fewer family
physicians. Prenatal care was still available in 17 of 19 communities, but local women
would need to travel an average of 29 additional miles to access intrapartum care.
Conclusions. Rural obstetric unit closures are more common in smaller hospitals and
communities with a limited obstetric workforce. Concerns about continuity of rural
maternity care arise for women with local prenatal care but distant intrapartum care.
Key Words. Rural hospitals, obstetric units, closures, birth volume, obstetric
workforce
Over 28 million reproductive-age women (18–44 years) live in rural areas of
the United States (U.S. Census Bureau 2012), but the number of rural hospitals
providing obstetric care has decreased over the past two decades (Simpson
2011). This decrease raises concerns about access to maternity care and out-
comes for the half million women who give birth each year in rural hospitals
(Lorch et al. 2013; American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists
2014).

 Closure of hospital obstetric units or reduction of maternity services
(e.g., providing only prenatal care, but not labor and delivery services) in rural
areas may prolong travel time for rural women, who already travel further to
access care than their urban counterparts (Rayburn, Richards, and Elwell
2012). Having to travel for obstetric care is associated with higher costs,
greater risk of complications, and longer lengths of stay, along with financial,
social, and psychological stress for patients (Sontheimer et al. 2008; American
College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists 2014).
Hospital closures have been studied extensively (Holmes et al. 2006;
Bazzoli et al. 2012), but few studies have specifically examined reasons for
obstetric unit closures. A few studies have focused solely on obstetric unit clo-
sures in urban hospitals (Smits et al. 2009; Lorch et al. 2013). In one study of
27 rural hospitals that stopped providing obstetric services, the most fre-
quently cited reasons for stopping were the low volume of deliveries in the
hospital, difficulty staffing an obstetric unit, and financial vulnerability due to
high proportions of patients on Medicaid (Zhao 2007).
In this paper, we used qualitative and quantitative methods to identify
hospital and community factors that may precipitate closure of rural obstetric
units.
METHODS
Data and Study Population
We conducted a telephone survey of rural hospitals that provided obstetric
services in nine states: Colorado, Iowa, Kentucky, New York, North Carolina,
Oregon, V
ermont, Washington, and Wisconsin, from September 2013 to
March 2014. The survey sample consisted of all 306 rural hospitals in these
nine states with at least 10 births in the 2010 Healthcare Cost and Utilization
Project’s (HCUP) Statewide Inpatient Databases (SID). The SID all-payer
databases include 100 percent of hospital discharges; obstetric deliveries were
identified using a validated algorithm (Kuklina et al. 2008). The nine states
were chosen because of their sizeable rural population, the number of rural

 hospitals providing obstetric care, their regional distribution, and the avail-
ability of hospital identifiers in the SID data, which allow linkage with other
data sources, including the American Hospital Association Annual Survey
(AHA) and the Area Resource File (ARF). Rural hospitals were identified
based on the Office of Management and Budget nonmetropolitan county
definition.
A multidisciplinary team, including an advisory panel of rural hospital
obstetric unit managers, collaborated to design the survey instrument. A total
of 263 hospitals responded to the survey, yielding an 86 percent response rate.
The 43 nonresponding hospitals were similar to responding hospitals on most
characteristics, but they were less likely to be critical access hospitals or pub-
licly owned and had higher birth volume on average than responding hospi-
tals that continued providing obstetric services or those that closed the units
(Appendix SA2). The survey responses were subsequently merged with SID,
AHA, and ARF data to create an analytic dataset. Nineteen of the 263 hospi-
tals reported no longer doing deliveries; administrators at these hospitals were
asked about the date of closing the obstetric unit, the reasons for closure, and
the availability of prenatal care in the community after unit closures.
This analysis compares the 19 rural hospitals that closed their obstetric
units during 2011–2014 with the 244 hospitals that continued providing
obstetric services.
Dependent and Independent Variables
The primary outcome of analysis was obstetric unit closure. Explanatory vari-
ables of interest were selected based on the literature on obstetric service pro-
vision (Lawhorne and Zweig 1989; Nesbitt 2002; Zhao 2007) and open-ended
responses to our telephone survey. They included system affiliation, owner-
ship, payer mix, nurse staffing, birth volume, distance to and birth volume in
the closest hospital providing obstetrics, and county-level provider supply
and population characteristics. Availability of prenatal care services in the
community was a secondary outcome for the qualitative analysis.
Hospital-Level Characteristics. Hospital organizational characteristics (e.g.,
accreditation, system affiliation, and ownership) were obtained from the 2010
AHA Annual Survey. Due to the small number of for-profit hospitals in the
sample, hospitals were categorized as private (including nonprofit and for-
profit) or public. AHA data were also used to calculate the number of regis-
1548

 tered nurse full-time equivalents (FTEs) per 1,000 adjusted inpatient days, as
well as the distance (geodetic and driving distance in miles) between each sam-
ple hospital and their closest hospital with 10 or more births using the corre-
sponding latitude and longitude, and the number of births in the closest
hospital, to serve as market influences.
Based on the previous literature (Zhao 2007), we hypothesized that hos-
pital-level birth volume and payer mix would be associated with a unit’s finan-
cial viability and ability to remain open. Birth volume and payer mix (the
percentage of women who either had Medicaid as the primary payer or were
uninsured at the time of the birth hospitalization) for the sample hospitals
came from the SID.
County-Level Characteristics. The supply of obstetric providers in a county may
influence a rural hospital’s ability to continue providing obstetric services.
Using ARF data, we calculated the number of obstetrician–gynecologists
(OBGYNs) and certified nurse midwives per 1,000 females aged 18–40 years,
and the number of family physicians per 10,000 population in 2010. To further
capture socioeconomic characteristics in a county where a hospital was
located, we derived the 2006–2010 median family income from ARF data. A
proxy measure for obstetric care demand was the number of females aged 18–
40 years in 2010 in the county where a hospital was located.
Analysis
We employed qualitative analysis of survey responses to determine reasons
for closures and postclosure community capacity for prenatal care. While the
question regarding capacity for prenatal care following closure was open-
ended, responses were easily classified into affirmative or negative responses
regarding continued availability of obstetric services. Responses were further
classified based on whether continued availability of prenatal care was accessi-
ble through the same hospital or clinic system or through another health care
delivery system in the same community. The question regarding reasons for
obstetric unit closure was analyzed using iterative inductive coding to identify
salient themes. An a priori listing of themes was developed based on extant lit-
erature (Zhao 2007), including staffing concerns, low birth volume, low reim-
bursement rates, and other financial concerns (such as administrative issues,
liability costs, etc.). Responses were categorized into the theme that most
closely fit the content of the response. Some responses were categorized under
Why Are Obstetric Units in Rural Hospitals Closing Their Doors?
1549
 more than one theme. Categorization of responses by salient theme was origi-
nally implemented by one author (PH) and confirmed by two coauthors
(KBK, MMC).
In the quantitative analysis, to further examine bivariate relationships
between explanatory factors and closures, two-group t-tests and Fisher tests
were used. We then used logistic regression to estimate the likelihood of
obstetric unit closure across hospitals using birth volume in 2010 when they
were providing obstetric care. The likelihood was measured by odds ratios
(ORs) using a crude model for each variable, and an adjusted model (adjusted
ORs, AORs) controlling for potential confounders previously mentioned. We
calculated the predicted probability of unit closures based on this model and
the mean values for covariates (Table 1), to illustrate the association between
hospital birth volume and obstetric unit closures. We computed robust stan-
dard errors to account for correlation between hospitals within states. To detect
the potential collinearity issues between the covariates, we employed variance inflator
factors (VIF) and tolerance measures from the regression. The VIF for all covariates ran-
ged from 1.08 to 1.58, with the corresponding tolerance level of 1.03 to 1.26.
The descriptive analyses were conducted with SAS version 9.3 (SAS Insti-
tute Inc, Cary, NC, USA); the driving distance was calculated using SAS
URL access method to Google Maps with hospitals’ longitudes and latitudes
from the AHA annual survey (Zdeb 2010). The regression analyses were with
Stata version 13 (StataCorp LP., College Station, TX, USA).
RESULTS
Among the 263 rural hospitals that responded to our survey, 7.2 percent
closed their obstetric units between 2010 and early 2014 (Table 1). Unadjusted
comparisons revealed that rural hospitals that kept their units open differed
significantly from those that closed their obstetric units on several characteris-
tics. Discontinuation of obstetric services was more likely to occur in critical
access hospitals than other rural hospitals (83 percent vs. 51 percent,
p = .006), and less likely in accredited hospitals (33 percent vs. 62 percent,
p = .012). On average, obstetric units that remained open had almost fourfold
the birth volume of closed units in 2010 (328 vs. 87 births, p < .001). Among
the closed units, birth volume ranged from 11 to 726 births in 2010, while the
units remaining open had from 10 to 1,610 births.
The average supply of obstetricians in counties where units remained
open was about twice as high as in counties where units closed (0.55 vs. 0.3 per

 1,000 females 18–40 years old, p = .006). The counties where units closed also
had 0.13 fewer family physicians doing patient care per 1,000 population (0.26
vs. 0.39, p = .005), and over $4,500 lower median family income over the past
5 years ($50,407 vs. $54,928, p = .018) than unaffected counties. Unit clo-
sures did not vary significantly by system affiliation, hospital ownership, dis-
tance from the nearest hospital providing obstetric services, or the proportion
of women who reported Medicaid as a primary payer or were insured for their
birth hospitalization in 2010.
Among the 19 hospitals that closed their obstetric units, the most com-
monly cited reason for closure was difficulty in staffing the unit (n = 15),
including retention, recruitment, and liability issues surrounding obstetri-
cians. Other frequently cited reasons for closure included low birth volume
(n = 9), low reimbursement (n = 3), and other financial issues (n = 6), such as
surgical and anesthesia coverage, the cost of operating the units, and budget
cuts (Table 2).
Most of the rural hospitals that closed their obstetric units stated that
prenatal care was still available in the community through hospital-owned
or affiliated clinics or private practices. However, two hospitals reported
that women in their communities no longer have local access to prenatal
care due to the obstetric unit closure. Rural women in these two commu-
nities will need to travel 25.4 miles and 40.8 miles to the nearest hospitals
where obstetric services are available. Rural women in the 17 communities
where obstetric units were closed but prenatal care is available will need
to travel an average of 29 miles with a range from 9 to 65 miles to the
next available hospital for obstetric care.
The survey responses revealed the challenges that rural hospitals face in
providing obstetric services, as well as some of the trade-offs they made when
deciding to close an obstetric unit. One hospital explained, “A nurse practi-
tioner/nurse midwife is providing care but will be leaving soon. Then there
will be no prenatal care available for the community.” Other hospitals are only
able to offer prenatal care for low-risk women, explaining, “It’s only well-
mom prenatal care up to 36 weeks (no high risk). . .We then hand them off to
an OB doctor. . .or a midwife in another community.”
Table 3 presents the unadjusted and adjusted odds ratio (AORs) for pre-
dictors of obstetric unit closures. The adjusted model, controlling for hospital,
market, and county characteristics, as well as state clustering, explained one-
third of the variation in obstetric unit closures. In the unadjusted analysis,
potential predictors associated with obstetric unit closures include annual
birth volume (OR [95 percent confidence interval] = 0.28 [0.1, 0.75]), county-
1552

 level supply of OBGYNs (0.33 [0.11, 0.95]), county-level supply of family
physicians (0.64 [0.42, 0.98]), and county-level median family income (0.94
[0.86, 0.99]).
Holding other confounders constant, we found that private nonprofit
and for-profit rural hospitals had almost three times higher odds of closing
their units (AORs = 3.84, 95 percent CI = [1.37, 10.77]; p = .008) than public
nonfederal hospitals. Hospitals with 100 more births annually had 90 percent
lower odds of obstetric unit closure (AORs = 0.10, 95 percent CI = [0.02,
0.43]; p < .001). Birth volume alone predicted about 10 percent of variation in
the odds of unit closure. Figure 1 presents the predicted probability that a

 rural hospital would close its obstetric unit, by birth volume, based on mean
values for covariates (Table 1) and the adjusted model (Table 3).
The county-level supply of family physicians, median family income
over the past 5 years, and the population of reproductive-age women were all
negatively associated with unit closure. Rural hospitals in communities with
an additional family physician per 10,000 population had 38 percent lower
odds of obstetric unit closure (AOR = 0.62 [0.43, 0.90]; p = .014), and those
in counties with a $1,000 higher median family income per year had almost 10
percent lower odds of unit closure (AOR = 0.92 [0.86, 0.99]; p = .047).
DISCUSSION
Our analysis identified several significant risk factors associated with rural
obstetric unit closures between 2010 and 2014. These factors include low birth
volume, private hospital ownership, a limited local supply of family physi-
cians, and location in a lower income county.

 Although the predicted probability of obstetric unit closure increased
significantly as birth volume decreased, high birth volume alone does not
assure continued operation. One of the rural hospitals that stopped doing
deliveries, for example, had 726 births in 2010, which is above the median
birth volume for rural hospitals with obstetric units during that year. However,
the significantly higher probability of unit closures among hospitals with lower
than 100 annual births suggests that additional rural hospitals will be vulnera-
ble to obstetric unit closure in the future.
Continued consolidation of obstetric services has potential implications
both for the access and the quality of obstetric care in rural areas. Evidence on
volume–outcome relationships in obstetrics is mixed (Phibbs et al. 2007;
Kozhimannil et al. 2014a; Snowden and Cheng 2015). It is possible that clo-
sures of very low-volume obstetric units may produce net benefits for women
and infants in affected communities, if deliveries move to hospitals with suffi-
cient birth volume to maintain provider skills, and adequate access to prenatal
care is available. In the absence of appropriate regionalization of maternity
care, rural women may end up utilizing local emergency departments for
childbirth, given an average of 29 miles to reach the next nearest hospital with
obstetric services. Further research is warranted to examine the effects of
obstetric unit closures on local women’s maternity care access, childbirth
costs, and maternal/neonatal outcomes, including potential differential
impacts on high-risk and low-risk pregnant women.
The significant association between the local supply of family and
obstetric unit closures reflects the reliance of many smaller rural hospitals on
family physicians to provide obstetric care (Zhao 2007; Tong et al. 2012). This
finding is of particular concern given the challenges faced by rural communi-
ties in recruiting and retaining obstetric providers, as well as decreases nation-
ally in the number of family physicians being trained to provide obstetric care
and choosing to include obstetric care as part of their practices (Cohen and
Coco 2009; Tong et al. 2013).
The lack of a significant relationship between payer mix and obstetric
unit closure was somewhat surprising, given previous research indicating that
a primary reason for closures was high rates of births to women who were cov-
ered by Medicaid or uninsured (Zhao 2007). Differences in payer mix across
rural hospitals may be less important due to high rates of Medicaid coverage
among rural pregnant women; over half of all rural women who gave birth in
2010 had their birth hospitalizations covered by Medicaid (Kozhimannil et al.
2014b). Obstetric unit closure was associated, however, with hospital location
in a county with a lower median family income, suggesting that the overall
1556
HSR: Health Services Research 51:4 (August 2016)
 financial status of the local population may influence a hospital’s capacity to
maintain obstetric services.
The greater likelihood of obstetric unit closures among private rural hos-
pitals in our study, as compared to public hospitals, may be a function of pub-
lic hospitals’ focus on community needs. Previous research has found that
obstetric services are “relatively unprofitable” and that rural public and non-
profit hospitals are significantly more likely to provide obstetric services than
rural for-profit hospitals (Horwitz and Nichols 2011).
A hospital’s decision to discontinue obstetric services may depend on a
wide range of factors, including leadership, political environments, the
dynamics of the obstetric practice model, and patient–provider relationships
(Zhao 2007; Haywood 2011). Change in hospital leadership was stated as one
of the reasons for obstetric unit closures among our sample hospitals. How-
ever, our study was not able to measure hospital policies and obstetric care
provider characteristics, such as specialty and years of practice, as factors that
may have influenced the decision to close an obstetric unit.
Most rural hospitals in our survey reported that women continued
to have access to prenatal care in their communities after closing their
obstetric units. This finding is encouraging in terms of the potential for
maintaining access to adequate prenatal care in these communities, but it
underscores the importance of ensuring communication between local
providers providing prenatal care and more distant delivery hospitals pro-
viding
inpatient
intrapartum
care.
Ongoing
efforts
should
focus
on
encouraging linkages between maternity care providers and hospitals in
perinatal systems of care, including using telemedicine and health infor-
mation technology to help ensure continuity of maternity care.
Limitations
This study used data from nine geographically diverse states with large rural
populations; however, the results may not be generalizable to other states.
There are some limitations to measuring obstetric provider supply and
demand factors at the county level, as care patterns may cross county lines.
On average, 58.6 percent of the rural women in our analysis delivered in a
hospital that was located in the same county as their county of residence. How-
ever, we included market characteristics based on travel distance in our analy-
ses. Additionally, although obstetric units in hospitals with higher overall
nurse staffing levels would likely have higher staffing levels, our hospital-level
nurse staffing variable may not reflect levels in obstetric units.
Why Are Obstetric Units in Rural Hospitals Closing Their Doors?

 In summary, this mixed-method study demonstrated that birth volume,
private hospital ownership, and local characteristics such as lower median
family income and limited family physician supply were associated with
increased odds of obstetric unit closure in rural hospitals.
