Abstract
Adaptive servo-ventilation (ASV) is a form of non-invasive positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy that differs from other PAP devices. It 
includes features to overcome both obstructive and central sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) events. In the Treatment of Sleep-Disordered 
Breathing with Predominant Central Sleep Apnea by Adaptive Servo-Ventilation in Patients with Heart Failure (SERVE-HF) study, ASV 
significantly reduced SDB events in patients with systolic heart failure (HF) and predominant central sleep apnoea (CSA), but did not 
improve outcomes, and there was increased mortality risk in the ASV group. Although the SERVE-HF results represent a paradigm shift 
for ASV, they are only applicable to a small subset of ASV-treated patients, and there is no evidence suggesting that ASV use should stop 
altogether. There are a number of other indications and patient groups for whom ASV may be useful, effective and safe, including patients 
with treatment-emergent CSA, central apnoeas associated with long-term opioid therapy without alveolar hypoventilation, idiopathic 
Cheyne-Stokes respiration, after ischaemic stroke and those with HF with preserved ejection fraction. Additional research is required to 
better define the mechanism of increased risk associated with ASV identified in SERVE-HF and to more clearly characterise the specific 
patient phenotypes who benefit from ASV therapy.

Adaptive servo-ventilation (ASV) is a non-invasive ventilatory 
therapy that provides variable inspiratory positive airway pressure 
(IPAP) to support inspiration when breathing amplitude is reduced, 
ensures sufficient respiration when respiratory effort is absent and 
provides fixed or variable end-expiratory PAP (EPAP) to maintain 
upper airway patency. This approach is designed to mimic nasal 
continuous PAP (CPAP) in terms of pneumatically opening the 
upper airway and to directly suppress central sleep apnoeas 
without causing overventilation.1 In hypocapnic central sleep 
 
apnoea (CSA), where hyperventilation plays a major role, ASV has been 
shown to slightly increase carbon dioxide levels in patients with heart 
failure (HF).1
The pressure profile provided by ASV devices differs from those of other 
PAP therapies (see Figure 1). Although default settings are available, 
sleep laboratory-based individualised titration for each patient is more 
appropriate,2 and the best approach to maintain patient comfort, 
maximise adherence and preserve haemodynamics is to use minimum 
effective settings for IPAP
, EPAP and back-up rate.3 
Latest Trial Data on Adaptive Servo-Ventilation
In general, data on the use of ASV devices have come from small and/or 
uncontrolled studies and mainly from sleep clinics. This changed recently 
with the publication of the results of the SERVE-HF trial.4
SERVE-HF was the first long-term, randomised, controlled, international 
multicentre phase IV trial designed to investigate the effects of adding 
ASV to guideline-based medical management compared with medical 
management alone (control) on survival and cardiovascular outcomes 
in patients with symptomatic HF and reduced ejection fraction (EF) 
(HFrEF; EF ≤45 %) who had predominant CSA. The ability of ASV 
therapy to significantly reduce the apnoea–hypopnoea index (AHI) 
and improve oxygen saturation and other sleep-disordered breathing 
(SDB) parameters was confirmed in SERVE-HF
, but these effects did not 
translate into improved clinical outcomes.4
Unexpectedly, the trial results were neutral for the primary endpoint 
– first event of the composite of death from any cause, a life-saving 
cardiovascular intervention (defined as cardiac transplantation,

implantation of a long-term ventricular assist device, resuscitation after 
sudden cardiac arrest or appropriate shock for ventricular arrhythmia 
in patients with an implanted cardioverter defibrillator) or an unplanned 
hospitalisation for worsening HF – with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.13 
(95 % confidence interval [CI] 0.97, 1.32; p=0.113).4 Perhaps even more 
surprising was the identification of a safety signal in the ASV group, with 
device-treated patients at higher risk of experiencing all-cause (HR 1.28, 
95 % CI 1.06, 1.55; p=0.01) and cardiovascular (HR 1.34, 95 % CI 1.09, 
1.65; p=0.006) death.4 There were no significant differences between the 
ASV and control groups with respect to symptoms, exercise capacity 
or quality of life. The effects of ASV on blood gases, left ventricular EF 
and biomarkers are being assessed in the SERVE-HF major substudy 
(NCT01164592),5 the results of which will be available soon. Such data 
may help to better explain the main SERVE-HF findings.
Although the SERVE-HF results represent a paradigm shift for ASV, they 
are only applicable to a subset of ASV-treated patients (i.e. those with 
HFrEF [EF ≤45 %] and predominant CSA), and there is not any evidence 
to suggest a need to stop considering this therapy altogether. ASV has 
been studied in other indications, and accumulating evidence suggests 
that ASV may have a role in a number of patient groups outside those 
with HFrEF.
Adaptive Servo-Ventilation in Heart Failure 
with Preserved Ejection Fraction
Although the negative prognostic impact of HF with preserved EF 
(HFpEF) is similar to that of HFrEF,6 the two forms of HF represent 
different clinical syndromes and therefore should be studied and 
treated separately.7 HFpEF is more common in women and more often 
has a non-ishaemic aetiology,6,8 and there are currently no evidence-
based treatments available.8 In addition, there are important differences 
between HFpEF and HFrEF with respect to the acuteness and extent 
of myocardial dysfunction, patterns of remodelling in heart chambers 
and at the ultrastructural level, and in the response to therapeutic 
interventions.7 As a result of these differences, outcomes during ASV 
therapy in patients with HFpEF would be expected to be different from 
those of the SERVE-HF study population who had HFrEF.
The results of two small-scale studies9,10 with follow-up periods of 12 
and 18 months, respectively, suggest that the beneficial effects of ASV 
in patients with HFpEF might extend beyond improvements in the AHI 
and sleep parameters. In one study, HFpEF patients with Cheyne-Stokes 
respiration (CSR) who were treated with ASV (n=39) were compared 
with similar patients who refused ASV for various reasons (n=21) over 
a follow-up of 3–24 (mean 11.6) months.9 Sleep study results showed 
that ASV significantly reduced the AHI, longest apnoea and hypopnoea 
and maximum desaturation compared with controls. In addition, during 
cardiopulmonary exercise testing, patients in the ASV versus control 
group had significant increases in peak oxygen uptake (absolute value 
and percent predicted), oxygen uptake at the aerobic–anaerobic 
threshold and oxygen pulse. Significant decreases in left atrial diameter 
and peak early Doppler mitral inflow velocity (E)/peak atrial Doppler 
mitral inflow velocity (A), plus significant increases in A, mean early 
diastolic lengthening velocity (e’) and E/e’ were also reported.
In a randomised study that included 36 stable HFpEF patients with 
central SDB the cardiac event rate was compared between patients who 
received optimised medical treatment alone versus optimised medical 
treatment plus ASV (mean follow-up 543 days). A cardiac event was 
defined as cardiac death or rehospitalisation for HF decompensation. 
Over 6 months of treatment, HFpEF patients in the ASV group had a 
higher event-free rate (94.4 %) than those in the no ASV group (61.1 %; 
p<0.05).10 Significantly greater improvements from baseline were 
also documented in B-type natriuretic peptide levels and New York 
Heart Association (NYHA) functional class in the ASV versus no ASV 
groups, but there was no significant change in echocardiographically 
determined left ventricular EF from baseline to 6 months. From an SDB 
perspective, reductions from baseline in the AHI were 30.2/h in the 
ASV group versus 8.2/h in the no ASV group (p<0.001); corresponding 
reductions the central apnoea index (CAI) and hypopnoea index were 
9.0/h versus 4.3/h (p=0.045) and 12.0/h versus 1.2/h (p=0.011).10
It is possible that the increased sudden cardiac death rate associated 
with ASV treatment of CSA in patients with HFrEF identified in SERVE-
HF4 might be different in HFpEF

cardiac death is lower. However, larger long-term studies with hard 
clinical outcomes (e.g. mortality) are required to definitely answer this 
question. Until such data are available, the decision about whether to 
use ASV for the treatment of CSA in patients with HFpEF needs to be 
made on an individual patient basis, with management by a cardiologist 
(see below for recommendation on monitoring ASV therapy).  
Adaptive Servo-Ventilation Therapy in  
Sleep Apnoea
Treatment-emergent Central Sleep Apnoea
Treatment-emergent CSA, previously known as complex sleep apnoea, 
occurs in about 5–15 % of patients who undergo PAP titration for 
obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). The definition of treatment-emergent 
CSA is the persistence or emergence of central apnoeas and hypopnoeas 
during the initiation of PAP therapy without a backup respiratory rate for 
OSA, despite significant resolution of obstructive respiratory events.11 For 
most patients, treatment-emergent CSA is a transitory phenomenon that 
is not stable over time.12–14 One possible explanation is that the sleep 
fragmentation and sleep stage shifts associated with CPAP titration 
cause ventilatory control instability. This suggestion is supported by the 
finding that treatment-emergent CSA occurs more frequently on nights 
where CPAP-treated patients sleep poorly.12 Other predisposing factors 
might be the presence of coronary artery disease, pre-existing central 
apnoeas, the severity of OSA and use of opioids.12,14 However, treatment is 
required for the subgroup of patients with treatment-emergent CSA that 
persists during continued use of CPAP or bilevel PAP (biPAP) without a 
back-up frequency. In such settings, ASV is the most appropriate therapy. 
The effects of ASV on clinical and polysomnography (PSG) outcomes in 
patients with treatment-emergent CSA were compared with those of 
CPAP in a prospective, randomised clinical trial of 66 patients.15 After two 
nights of titration, AHI was 5.7/h in the ASV group versus 14.1/h in the 
CPAP group (p≤0.0003); corresponding values after 90 days’ treatment 
were 4.4/h and 9.9/h (p=0.0024). The CAI after titration was 1.1/h with ASV 
and 8.8/h with CPAP (p≤0.0003), and after 90 days was 0.7/h versus 4.8/h, 
respectively (p<0.0001). After 90 days, ASV was successful (AHI reduced to 
<10/h) in a higher proportion of patients than CPAP (89.7 % versus 64.5 %; 
p<0.0214). However, there were no significant differences between the 
ASV and CPAP groups with respect to compliance, daytime sleepiness 
and quality of life, and this trial did not assess changes in blood gases 
or cardiac function. In another randomised crossover trial, ASV has been 
shown to be more effective than non-invasive positive pressure ventilation 
for normalising complex, central and mixed apnoea syndromes.16 The 
beneficial effects of ASV in a multicentre, prospective observational trial of 
27 patients with CSA or treatment-emergent CSA included improvements 
in the AHI, CAI, obstructive apnoea index and arousal index during titration 
of therapy, changes that were maintained over 3 months of treatment.17 In 
addition, there was a significant reduction in the Epworth Sleepiness Scale 
(ESS) score during ASV (from 12.8 at baseline to 7.8; p=0.001); mean ASV 
adherence was 4.2 h/night. These data are supported by the results of 
retrospective analyses showing that ASV is more effective than other PAP 
therapies with respect to reductions in the AHI and improvements in sleep 
quality in patients with treatment-emergent CSA.18–20 A summary of the 
results of studies investigating the use of ASV in patients with treatment-
emergent CSA is presented in Table 1.
Opioid-induced Cheyne-Stokes Respiration
Central apnoeas have been detected using PSG in 17–24 % of patients 
receiving long-term opioid therapy for chronic pain.21,22 ASV therapy has 
been shown to improve SDB in opioid users in a number of clinical studies, 
and the result of a meta-analysis showed that treatment with ASV in 
patients with opioid-related CSA resulted in 58 % of patients achieving a 
CAI of <10/h, whereas CPAP was largely ineffective in this setting.23 
Clinically significant reductions in the AHI, CAI and hypopnoea index 
were observed after just 1 night of ASV use in patients receiving 
long-term opioid therapy for non-malignant pain who had CSA in one 
prospective multicentre study; these improvements were maintained 
throughout 3 months of home ASV therapy.24 Both short- and long-term 
reductions in AHI and CAI during ASV therapy were also documented 
in another study of opioid-associated CSA, and long-term adherence 
with ASV therapy in this setting was good (mean 5.1 h/night over a 
follow-up period of 9 months to 6 years).25 The proportion of responders 
also appears to be high, with 59.6 % achieving an AHI of <10/h during 
ASV therapy for CSA associated with chronic opioid use.26 ASV may also 
have the ability to improve obstructive apnoeas in this setting.27
Comparative data show that ASV is more effective at reducing central 
apnoeas in chronic opioid users than both biPAP and CPAP
. In a small 
group of chronic opioid recipients who had no improvement in sleep 
apnoea during 1 night of CPAP therapy, use of ASV for 1 night completely 
eliminated central and obstructive apnoeas and reduced the hypopnoea 
index to 13/h, compared with an AHI of 70/h at baseline and 55/h 
during CPAP
.28 In another study, AHI and CAI values were significantly

lower during short-term use of ASV compared with spontaneous-timed 
mode biPAP (biPAP-ST) (2.5/h versus 16.3/h; p=0.0005 and 0.4/h versus 
9.4/h; p=0.0002, respectively).29 In this prospective, crossover trial, the 
proportion of patients who had normalised respiratory parameters 
was 83.3 % during ASV and 33.3 % during bilevel-ST, and scores on the 
Morning After Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire showed that patients 
felt more awake after ASV versus bilevel-ST treatment (p=0.0337).29 The 
results of studies investigating the use of ASV in patients with sleep 
apnoea receiving long-term opioid therapy are summarised in Table 2.
Idiopathic Cheyne-Stokes Respiration
In some cases, despite extensive investigations, no obvious cause for 
CSA-CSR is found and this is referred to as idiopathic CSR, the exact 
prevalence of which is unknown. The feasibility of using ASV to treat 
idiopathic CSR was assessed in three patients who had not responded 
well to CPAP and oxygen therapy. ASV treatment reduced the abnormal 
events index from 35.2/h to 3.5/h, and there was also a significant 
reduction in the number of arousals (18.5/h to 1.1/h). Importantly, 
follow-up at 6–12 months showed a significant improvement in daytime 
alertness and mood in ASV recipients.30
Sleep Apnoea after Ischaemic Stroke
SDB can be documented in between 50 % and 70 % of patients after 
acute ischaemic stroke31,32 and persists beyond the acute period in a 
substantial proportion of patients.33 The role of ASV for the treatment 
of persistent CSA after acute ischaemic stroke was investigated in 
15 patients, 13 of whom had previously been unsuccessfully treated 
with CPAP or biPAP
.34 AHI was 46.7/h at baseline, and decreased to 
8.5/h (p=0.001) and 10.7/h (p=0.024) after 3 and 6 months of ASV, 
respectively. ASV also improved daytime sleepiness, with a decrease 
in the ESS score from 8.6 at baseline to 5.6 during ASV (p=0.08). In 
patients who used ASV for ≥5 h/night, the ESS score decreased from 9.0 
at baseline to 4.2 (p=0.028). ASV usage during the trial was good, with 
an average of 5 hours 20 minutes per night at 3 months and 6 hours 
 
22 minutes per night at 6 months. ASV was also well tolerated and no 
severe side effects were reported. 
When Not to Use Adaptive Servo-Ventilation
As has always been the case, ASV should not be used in any situation 
where hypoventilation is present in the basal state. Therefore, blood 
gases should be checked before treatment initiation, as for any other 
ventilation strategy. In addition, based on the results of the SERVE-HF 
study, ASV is now contraindicated in patients with HFrEF (left ventricular 
EF of 45 % or less) and predominant CSA. Any current ASV recipients 
who meet these criteria should be advised of the SERVE-HF results and 
their implications and switched to an alternative mode of therapy. 
Monitoring Therapy
There are currently no published guidelines on patient monitoring 
and follow-up during ASV therapy. Therefore, physicians need to 
use their clinical practice experience and common sense. Before 
treatment initiation, it would seem appropriate to check for HF 
symptoms, carefully review the patient’s medical history (paying 
special attention to cardiac events) and, if in doubt, determine the left 
ventricular EF using echocardiography (especially in patients who may 
have cardiovascular disease). Short-term follow-up should involve

checking for leaks, side effects and adherence to therapy. Assessment 
of treatment efficacy with polygraphy or PSG after 1–3 months, 
and a 6-month follow-up consisting of a clinical interview, machine 
download and full clinical assessment seems reasonable. Ongoing 
echocardiographic monitoring of the EF seems prudent when ASV is 
used in patients with cardiac disease. 
Perspective and Future Directions
An important area of ongoing research is to elucidate the 
pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the cardiovascular safety 
signal identified in HFrEF patients treated with ASV in the SERVE-HF study. 
This will allow identification of specific subgroups of HFrEF patients in 
whom ASV should be avoided, and others who may benefit from ASV 
therapy. Data from the SERVE-HF major substudy5 and on-treatment 
analysis, the ADVENT-HF trial (NCT01128816) and ongoing registries, 
such as the French multicentre, prospective FACE cohort study,35 will 
hopefully provide some insight into the use of ASV in subgroups of HFrEF 
patients with CSA, patients with HFrEF and OSA or OSA with coexisting 
CSA and those with HFpEF and both forms of SDB. The effects of ASV 
in patients with acute decompensated HF are being investigated in the 
CAT-HF study (NCT01953874). Outside of HF
, more data are needed on 
the use of ASV in patients with different CSA phenotypes, including 
treatment-emergent and opioid-induced central apnoeas.
Conclusion
There are a number of unanswered questions about the current and 
future place of ASV therapy in patients with various forms of SDB. Based 
on the results of the SERVE-HF study, ASV therapy should be avoided 
in patients with HFrEF and predominant CSA with CSR, and when ASV 
is used in other indications close patient monitoring is recommended, 
especially in subgroups at risk of developing HF. However, currently 
available data do suggest that ASV has beneficial effects in patients 
with treatment-emergent CSA, central apnoeas associated with 
 
long-term opioid therapy without alveolar hypoventilation, idiopathic 
CSR, after ischaemic stroke, and in those with HFpEF. Long-term data 
on the effects of ASV on morbidity and mortality in these patient 
groups are not yet available and therefore initiation of treatment is 
a decision that should be made individually for each patient, and 
therapy continued only if the patient shows subjective and objective 
improvements during treatment. n
