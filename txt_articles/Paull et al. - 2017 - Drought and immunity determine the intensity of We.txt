The effect of global climate change on infectious disease remains hotly debated
because multiple extrinsic and intrinsic drivers interact to influence trans-
mission dynamics in nonlinear ways. The dominant drivers of widespread
pathogens, like West Nile virus, can be challenging to identify due to regional
variability in vector and host ecology, with past studies producing disparate
findings. Here, we used analyses at national and state scales to examine a
suite of climatic and intrinsic drivers of continental-scale West Nile virus epi-
demics, including an empirically derived mechanistic relationship between
temperature and transmission potential that accounts for spatial variability in
vectors. We found that drought was the primary climatic driver of increased
West Nile virus epidemics, rather than within-season or winter temperatures,
or precipitation independently. Local-scale data from one region suggested
drought increased epidemics via changes in mosquito infection prevalence
rather than mosquito abundance. In addition, human acquired immunity fol-
lowing regional epidemics limited subsequent transmission in many states.
We show that over the next 30 years, increased drought severity from climate
change could triple West Nile virus cases, but only in regions with low
human immunity. These results illustrate how changes in drought severity
can alter the transmission dynamics of vector-borne diseases.
1. Background
Climate change and emerging infectious diseases are predicted to have substantial
impacts on human health [1,2]. However, predictions about how these threats will
interact and where disease risk will be greatest have been the subject of substantial
controversy [2–5]. Warming is most likely to increase disease risk in places where
transmission is primarily limited by low temperatures [3–5]. However, public
health efforts may limit the effects of climate on disease risk [6]. Similarly, pre-
cipitation and drought can have contrasting effects on vector population and
host–vector dynamics [7], further complicating prediction efforts.
Although climate change impacts on disease have drawn substantial atten-
tion, acquired immunity also plays a large role in disease dynamics [8,9]. Even
when herd immunity has traditionally been considered less important for disease
transmission (e.g. in cases when seroprevalence is low, or for zoonotic pathogens
for which humans are incidental hosts), host heterogeneity in risk of exposure
to vectors can increase the effective immunity far above measured levels [10].
The interaction of intrinsic and extrinsic factors makes it difficult to examine
immunity or climate alone [11].

 Predicting yearly epidemics of West Nile virus (WNV) is
emblematic of these challenges. Since the introduction of
WNV to the USA in 1999, there has been, on average, 50-fold
interannual variation in the number of cases in each state
where WNV occurs [12,13]. This enormous variability makes
public health allocation decisions difficult, and highlights the
utility of accurate predictions of future case burdens [14].
Transmission of vector-borne pathogens like WNV is influ-
enced by multiple climatic drivers (figure 1a). Temperature

 because increases in replication rates of pathogens and vectors
are eventually overwhelmed by accelerating decreases in
vector survival at high temperatures [5,20] (figure 1b–e).
Increased precipitation could either increase or reduce mosquito
abundance by creating breeding sites or flushing container-
breeding mosquitoes, depending upon the intensity [21,22].
Additionally, mosquito populations could either decline
during droughts due to reduced breeding habitat, or increase
in abundance due to increased habitat quality or reduced
predators [23]. Furthermore, drought—which is influenced by
both precipitation and temperature—could increase WNV
prevalence in mosquitoes via increased contact (due to host
movement to mosquito habitats [24]), or higher vector-to-
host ratios (due to drought-induced reductions in juvenile
birds [25,26]).
Our analyses build upon previous studies of climate–
WNV associations that were conducted over smaller state- or
county-level areas [7,27–31] or for shorter periods of time
[22,32,33], or that analysed dichotomized values of WNV
[34,35]. We have added key mechanistic drivers including
human population immunity and a temperature-dependent
R0, and we project WNV incidence, rather than changes in
the
distribution
or
probability
of
above-average
years
[32,35,36] or changes in vector populations [37] under future
climate change. We analysed the intrinsic (immune) and extrin-
sic (climate) factors driving interannual variation in West Nile
neuroinvasive disease (WNND) incidence across the continen-
tal USA since WNV introduction (1999–2013), and explored
potential mechanisms by analysing vector transmission data
from a WNV hotspot. State-level analyses allowed us to exam-
ine regional variation in WNV drivers that arise from varying
host and vector ecologies and infection histories in different
parts of the country. Specifically, we hypothesized that temp-
erature would be most important at the colder edges of
the vector distributions, and that immunity would be most
important in states that had previously had large epidemics.
2. Material and methods
(a) Models
We fitted annual numbers of human WNND cases, N, to the fol-
lowing model:
LnðNÞ ¼ LnðN0Þ þ lI þ aT þ vP þ dD þ gF,
ð2:1Þ
where I is cumulative incidence (see the electronic supplementary
material, figure S1), T is the value of the mosquito species-
specific temperature-driven relative R0 value (using mean May–
August temperatures; see the electronic supplementary material),
P is total May–August precipitation, D is average May–August
values of the Palmer Drought Severity Index [38] and F is winter
severity (freezes: the number of weeks in the previous winter
with average temperature below 08C). The parameters l, a, v, d
and g are the fitted coefficients for these predictors.
We chose these weather factors because they were biologically
relevant to vector and host species involved in WNV transmission,
and they were correlated with WNV risk in previous local-scale
studies [27,28,39]. There was relatively low correlation among
these predictors; the maximum variance inflation factor was 2.17,
below a suggested cut-off of 3 [40]. We used county-level values
of these weather variables to create state-wide weighted averages,
with counties weighted by the relative number of WNND cases
recorded in each county between 1999 and 2009; county-level
WNND data after 2009 were not available from the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention (CDC). We used precipitation and
temperature data from May through August, because these are
the months when the majority of WNV infective mosquitoes
become infected [41].
We estimated three temperature-dependent R0 relationships,
one for each of the three most important WNV mosquito vector
species, using the fitted relationships for temperature-dependent
biting rates, mortality rates and inverse of the extrinsic incubation
period for Culex tarsalis, C. quinquefasciatus and C. pipiens (elec-
tronic supplementary material). To calculate the vector-specific
temperature–R0 curve shown in figure 1e, we derived the equation
for effective reproductive ratio. We inserted the fitted relationships
with temperature into the equation to estimate values of relative R0
at a given temperature for each mosquito species, which we used in
place of raw temperature values (electronic supplementary
material).
We constrained the parameters for the slope of the relation-
ship between log cases and both cumulative incidence (l) and
number of freezes (g) to be negative, and temperature-driven
R0 (a) to be positive, to reflect the biological mechanisms these
parameters represent. To fit this model at the national level, we
used a generalized linear mixed effects model by penalized
quasi-likelihood with a negative binomial distribution and log
link, allowing the slope of the immunity term to vary as a
random effect of state using function glmmPQL in the MASS
package in R v. 3.0.2. At the state level, we fitted the same
model (without the state random effects) using glm.nb in the
MASS package. There was no evidence of significant temporal
autocorrelation in the residuals of the fitted models. We excluded
initial years in which human WNND was found in less than 30%
of counties making up the final distribution in a state to ensure
we analysed trends only after full establishment. We also
excluded states with less than 10 total cases or less than 6
years of data. We performed analyses at the state level because
this is the highest spatial resolution for which the CDC provides
access to ArboNET data differentiated by case definition (e.g.
fever, encephalitis, etc.). We calculated the relative importance
of predictor variables based on the magnitude of coefficients of
standardized (Z-transformed) predictor variables. We performed
cross-validation of the fitted models by re-fitting the final models
while excluding each year of data sequentially, and using the
new fitted model to predict the excluded datapoints. We then
generated a prediction accuracy value for each state (electronic
supplementary material, table S2) as follows:
Pmod ¼ 1 �
Pt
t¼2 ðPt � CtÞ2
Pt
t¼2 ðCt � Ct�1Þ2 ,
ð2:2Þ
where t is the year, P is the predicted value and C is the number
of cases. We chose an autoregressive null model since our model
showed immunity to be important in some states and a grand
mean null would always include the first year when there was
no immunity built up in the population.
(b) Historical meteorological and future climate
data sources
To build our predictive models, we used bias-corrected daily mini-
mum and maximum temperature and precipitation data from 1999
to 2013 in the National Centers for Environmental Prediction
North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) data [42]. Owing
to biases in the NARR data that can affect the frequency of occur-
rence of critical biological thresholds [43], we bias-corrected
temperature and precipitation variables at the monthly scale
using Oregon State University’s monthly PRISM climate data as
our observational standard [44] (see the electronic supplementary
material). To project the influence of future climate change on the
prevalence of WNND cases, we used bias-corrected data from an
ensemble of 10 realizations of the International Center for Theoreti-
cal Physics regional climate model (‘RegCM4’) [45] using the
rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org
Proc. R. Soc. B 284: 20162078
3
 RCP8.5 scenario, which is the IPCC scenario that is most consistent
with the recent trajectory of historical emissions [46] (electro-
nic supplementary material). Bias correction with historically
observed standards assumes that the structure of biases in the
historical period will remain similar in future projections [47].
(c) Future case projections
We generated projections for current and future numbers of
WNND cases using fitted models that included only the significant
predictors. We estimated mean current (MC) and extreme current
(EC) cases by taking the mean (MC) and 95th percentile (EC) of pro-
jections for each year using the 1999–2013 bias-corrected NARR
climate. For future projections, we estimated cases using climate
data from the years 2036–2049 for each of the 10 climate model
realizations in each year. We then averaged across years within
each of the model realizations to get 10 projected values (one for
each model realization), and calculated the mean (MF) and 95th
percentile (EF) of those values. Error bars include both the standard
error of the mean and the standard deviation of the residuals
between current projected and actual numbers of cases nationally
from 2003 to 2013 (after WNV had spread across the USA). Extreme
outliers (e.g. values for Michigan and one model realization in
Maryland) were excluded from the national case totals because
they resulted from a non-asymptotic relationship between R0 and
incidence (see the electronic supplementary material).
(d) Local mosquito data
Mosquitoes were collected from 15 counties in Colorado between
2003 and 2008 using CDC light and hay-infusion baited gravid
traps that were run one night per week from June to September.
Culex mosquitoes were pooled by species and tested for WNV
using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in pools
of up to 50 [48]. To determine whether there were more human
infections at a given level of entomological risk in the first
year, when all humans were naive, as compared with subsequent
years after immunity had built up, we tested for an effect of the
density of infected mosquitoes (DIM) and year (either 2003, or all
subsequent years combined) on the number of human WNND
cases. To do this, we used a generalized linear mixed effects
model with a negative binomial distribution and log link, treat-
ing county as a random effect, and using function glmmPQL
in the MASS package in R v. 3.0.2. We also used a generalized
linear model to test for relationships between drought and
vector abundance (using a negative binomial distribution) and
vector WNV prevalence (using a binomial distribution) in each
transmission season.
(e) Effective herd immunity
Previous research on fine-scale spatial variation in mosquito
abundance suggests that 90% of transmission occurs in just
20% of locations for vector-borne infections (averaged from
Woolhouse et al. [10]; figure 1a). While these data are for parasitic
diseases within Anopheles mosquitoes, the general principle of
heterogeneity has been found to be remarkably consistent
across a range of disease systems [49]. If 90% of WNV-infected
bites occur in a subset of 20% of a state’s population, the effective
herd immunity could be as much as 0.9/0.2, or 4.5 times, higher
than the seroprevalence that is calculated by assuming that 100%
of the population is at risk.
3. Results
Both intrinsic (immunity) and extrinsic (climate) drivers were
important predictors of WNND incidence, with immunity and
droughtbeingthestrongestpredictorsofthenumberof observed
annual WNND cases at the national and state levels (figures 2
and 3; electronic supplementary material, figures S2–S6 and
tables S1 and S2). Local data from Colorado, one of the states
hit hardest by WNV, further support a mechanistic link between
WNV incidence and drought and immunity. Drought was corre-
lated with elevated infection prevalence in the two most
importantmosquitovectors in thestate (C. pipiens and C. tarsalis),
but was uncorrelated with mosquito abundance (electronic sup-
plementary material, figure S7). Additionally, in the first year
that WNV had spread across the full state of Colorado, when
most of the population was naive, there were more human
cases than expected for a given DIM [48] than in subsequent
years (figure 3c; year coeff. ¼ 1.7, t ¼ 12.7, p , 0.001; DIM
coeff. ¼ 0.2, t ¼ 13.8, p , 0.001). For instance, when the DIM
was one infected mosquito per trap-night, there were five pre-
dicted cases in the first year, compared with just one predicted
case in subsequent years. Temperature-driven R0 (calculated
using May–September mean temperature), winter severity (no.
of weeks below freezing) and total May–September precipi-
tation were weakly significant predictors at the national level,
and present in only 24%, 7% and 27% of states, respectively.
The explanatory power of state-level models was rela-
tively high, except in the few states where variation in cases
was uncorrelated with measures of climate and immunity.
The null model was the best fit in states with relatively few
cases (e.g. West Virginia and New Jersey), as well as in
some large, climatically variable states (e.g. Texas, Arizona,
New Mexico and Minnesota). Finer-spatial-scale analyses of
weather drivers in these larger states may reveal additional
weather drivers whose effects may have been masked when
averaged across a climatically variable state [27]. Addition-
ally, some of the unexplained variation may be due to
factors that we were unable to include in the model, such
as vector control efforts, and changes in virus genetics, host
resistance [50] or bird communities [51]. Models explained
an average of 58% of the non-stochastic variance in the
number of neuroinvasive WNV cases in the 38 states where
the best model was not the null (electronic supplementary
material, table S2). Similarly, cross-validation techniques
using the model to predict data not used to build the
model indicated that fitted models had a prediction accuracy
of 65% across the 31 states where they were a better predictor
than the null hypothesis value of the previous year’s case
burden (electronic supplementary material, table S2 and
figure S8). Prediction accuracies were highest in states
where immunity was a significant predictor. In addition,
models for states where immunity was not significant
occasionally predicted larger than observed epidemics in
some years (electronic supplementary material, figure S8).
We used the fitted models described above, along with an
ensemble of high-resolution climate model simulations [45], to
estimate current and future WNND cases in each state. The
models project an average of 991+683 WNND cases each
year under average current climate conditions and 2013 levels
of acquired immunity, whereas up to 1331+712 cases could
occur in a relatively intense year (95th percentile of projected
cases) driven by climate variation (figure 4a). Climate change is
projected to nearly double the mean WNND burden (1814+
783 cases) by the mid-twenty-first century, while the 95th per-
centile is likely to increase by a factor of 2.5 (3297+1123 cases),
assuming current immunity levels and no viral evolution that
substantially increases competence in hosts or vectors, or
allows re-infection of previously exposed individuals.

 4. Discussion
WNV has been called ‘unpredictable’ because of enormous
local- and continental-scale variability in WNV incidence,
and variation in avian host and mosquito vector ecology
[14]. However, our results suggest that models that incorpor-
ate mechanistic hypotheses and both intrinsic and extrinsic
drivers can improve the accuracy of predictions for complex
multi-host, multi-vector pathogens like WNV. We found
that the primary drivers of interannual variation in WNV
across the USA include drought and immunity, and that
increases in drought could potentially double WNV epidemic
intensity nationally, with epidemics in areas of low immunity
being even larger.
The projected future increase in WNV incidence is pri-
marily due to a doubling of the drought index. The positive
relationship between drought and WNV infection prevalence
in Colorado mosquitoes suggests that drought alters trans-
mission in this state not by reducing mosquito abundance,
but by increasing infection prevalence. This could occur if
lower avian reproduction [52] increases the vector–host
ratio, or if patterns of host–vector contact are altered due to
congregation
[24]
or
avian
stress
[53].
Similarly,
dry
summer soil moisture conditions have been positively corre-
lated
with
WNV
prevalence
in
Culex
mosquitoes
in
New York [39] as well as with spatial variation in the preva-
lence of the closely related Usutu flavivirus in Culex
mosquitoes in Italy [54]. Increased aridity is projected in
many regions of the USA in spite of increases in mean pre-
cipitation
[55,56],
highlighting
the
importance
of
considering moisture availability directly rather than relying
on precipitation as a proxy measure, because precipitation
alone was a poor predictor of WNV cases in most states.
The impact of immunity at both the national and state
levels was evident through a large reduction in human
cases in response to increasing cumulative incidence. At a
local level, during the first year that WNND reached epi-
demic levels across Colorado (and a majority of humans
were naive), the number of human cases for a given DIM
was higher than in subsequent years (figure 3c). This differ-
ence in human cases at the same level of entomological risk
suggests that human immunity rather than bird immunity
was driving the decrease in incidence, because bird immunity
can only affect human infections via mosquito infection, and
this is already taken into account by using DIM as the predic-
tor. Because humans are dead-end hosts for WNV, human
immunity does not reduce transmission between mosquitoes
and birds, but reduces human WNV cases by depleting
the susceptible human population. Human immunity has

 frequently been dismissed as a factor in patterns of WNV
incidence, because estimates of population-wide seropreva-
lence are uniformly low (less than 14%) [57,58], indicating
most of the population remains susceptible. However, hetero-
geneity in the risk of mosquito exposure means that only a
small subset of the population is likely to be at risk for
WNV, and the effective seroprevalence may be 4.5-fold
higher [10] (see Material and methods).
Although increased drought severity could approximately
double the number of WNV cases annually, the projected
increase would have been even greater without the limiting
role of immunity, and the actual increase in WNV incidence
may be smaller if herd immunity in human populations
increases before drought increases. Without the observed
build-up of human immunity, the number of projected
future cases would be sixfold higher nationally (11 673+
1921 cases; figures 2 and 4b). Nonetheless, despite accumulat-
ing immunity, the number of WNND cases in each state does
not always decline over time, because entomological risk
varies from year to year [48], and both transmission and the
build-up of herd immunity is spatially heterogeneous. In
states where acquired immunity is already relatively high,
intense future WNND epidemics are unlikely (electronic
supplementary material, figure S9). For example, no more
than 18 WNND cases are projected to occur in Wyoming
under current or future climate conditions, which is less
than 20% of the previous maximum of 92 cases. This state
recorded only five and two WNND cases in 2014 and 2015,
respectively, years not used to build the models [59]. How-
ever, states with above-average immigration or birth rates,
or changes in human behaviour or age structure that increase
their exposure to vectors or likelihood of developing the neu-
roinvasive form of the disease [57], and thus the at-risk
population, could lead to more cases than projected in regions
with high estimated immunity. Additionally, viral mutations
that would allow WNV to re-infect previously exposed indi-
viduals could limit the effect of immunity. Furthermore, in
states
where
there was
little
evidence
of
accumulated
human immunity, such as Virginia, models suggest that up
to 163 WNND cases could occur in an extreme year under
future climate conditions, which is over eight times higher
than the previous maximum of 20 cases. Our results thus
identify states most likely to experience future WNV epi-
demics, which could be used by federal agencies to allocate
control resources. An important question for future research
is how population immunity in humans will change with
variable yearly WNV transmission, and population turnover
through births, deaths and immigration.
The effects of temperature observed at finer spatial scales in
other studies may be less apparent at the state level, or after
accounting for immunity, and warmer temperatures may
increase incidence in areasthat are on the edge of being suitable
for transmission [27,35] (electronic supplementary material), as
is the case for malaria [4]. Previous studies have demonstrated

 positive effects of temperature and precipitation on vector
abundance [60–63], which can affect vector-borne disease
transmission [64]; however, the strong effects of drought on
infection prevalence in mosquitoes may overwhelm these
effects in some areas (electronic supplementary material).
The anticipated regional variability in which predictors
were most important can be partly explained by vector ecology
and geography. For instance, temperature-driven R0 values
tended to explain WNND cases in the northern range limits
of C. quinquefasciatus, as well as in several far northern states
(e.g. Montana, Idaho and Michigan). This is consistent with
the idea that warming at northern boundary edges will push
temperatures into more optimal ranges for transmission [3,5].
Winter freezes appear to be most important in extreme
southern portions of the USA where vectors may be more
poorly adapted to freezing temperatures. Precipitation had
generally positive effects in the eastern portion of the country
and negative effects in the west, consistent with the idea that
container-breeding mosquitoes may benefit from rain that
fills containers, while higher rain could increase wetland per-
manence
and
predation
[22,23].
Additionally,
irrigation
appears to influence WNV transmission in the western USA
[65],
which
could alter the importance of rainfall for
mosquito populations there.
Our analyses, which incorporated laboratory-derived
temperature–R0 relationships and immunity as a key intrin-
sic driver, has allowed us to determine the dominant
drivers of WNV incidence across the USA. The projected
future increase in WNV in the USA indicates a need for
increased resources for WNV surveillance, mitigation and
research, at a national scale. Furthermore, our results can
improve allocation of WNV mitigation resources in areas
where drought is a major driver, because the drought index
(PDSI) is calculated in real time. Because drought severity
is likely to alter transmission of other vector-borne diseases
in ways not captured by analyses of temperature and precipi-
tation alone, variations and changes in drought severity
should be examined as potential drivers of disease dynamics.
