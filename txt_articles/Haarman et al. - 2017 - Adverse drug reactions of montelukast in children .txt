Abstract
Montelukast, a selective
leukotriene receptor antagonist, is recommended in
guidelines for the treatment of asthma in both children and adults. However, its
effectiveness is debated, and recent studies have reported several adverse events
such as neuropsychiatric disorders and allergic granulomatous angiitis. This study
aims to obtain more insight into the safety profile of montelukast and to provide
prescribing physicians with an overview of relevant adverse drug reactions in
both children and adults. We retrospectively studied all adverse drug reactions
on montelukast in children and adults reported to the Netherlands Pharmacovig-
ilance Center Lareb and the WHO Global database, VigiBase� until 2016.
Depression was reported most frequently in the whole population to the global
database VigiBase� (reporting odds ratio (ROR) 6.93; 95% CI: 6.5–7.4). In the
VigiBase�, aggression was reported the most in children (ROR, 29.77; 95% CI:
27.5–32.2). Headaches were reported the most frequently to the Dutch database
(ROR, 2.26; 95% CI: 1.61–3.19). Furthermore, nightmares are often reported for
both children and adults to the Dutch and the global database. Eight patients
with allergic granulomatous angiitis were reported to the Dutch database and 563
patients in the VigiBase�. These data demonstrate that montelukast is associated
with neuropsychiatric adverse drug reactions such as depression and aggression.
Especially in children nightmares are reported frequently. Allergic granulomatous
angiitis is also reported, a causal relationship has not been established.

Introduction
Montelukast is a selective leukotriene receptor antagonist
(LTRA) and is prescribed in both children and adults for,
that is, the maintenance treatment of asthma and allergic
rhinitis. Although the effectiveness is debated, (Hon et al.
2014; Brodlie et al. 2015, 2016) guidelines recommend
montelukast for treatment of asthma (British Thoracic
Society;
Scottish
Intercollegiate
Guidelines
Network,
2014). The most common adverse events in adults
according to the summary of product characteristics
(SmPC) are upper airway infections (in >10% of all
users) fever, rash, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and elevated
levels of liver enzymes (Dutch Farmacotherapeutic Com-
pass, 2016). Most common adverse events in children (1–
10% of all users) according to the SmPC are headaches,

 abdominal pain, rash, thirst, hyperkinesia, asthma, and
eczema (Dutch Children’s Formulary, 2016). Recent stud-
ies have also reported adverse events such as sleeping dis-
orders and psychiatric disorders (Calapai et al. 2014). In
addition, allergic granulomatous angiitis (Churg-Strauss
syndrome) may also be associated with the use of mon-
telukast (Calapai et al. 2014).
The aim of this study is to obtain more insight into
the safety profile of montelukast in daily practice to pro-
vide prescribing physicians with an overview of relevant
adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in children and adults. We
therefore studied the reports of ADRs associated with
montelukast in the Dutch spontaneous reporting database
of the Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Center Lareb and
the WHO Global Individual Case Safety Report (ICSR)
database VigiBase�, maintained by the Uppsala Monitor-
ing Center (UMC) in Sweden.
Materials and methods
We retrospectively examined all ADRs on montelukast
(Anatomical
and
Therapeutic
Chemical
classification
(ATC) code R03DC03) in children aged 0–18 years and
adults aged 19 years and older reported to the Nether-
lands Pharmacovigilance Center Lareb and the WHO
Global ICSR database, VigiBase� until 2016.
The reports in the Dutch spontaneous database (until
13-07-2016) were coded with the Medical Dictionary for
Regulatory
Activities
(MedDRA�)
and
individually
assessed for causality by trained assessors.
For the Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Center Lareb,
data, including suspect drug, co-medication, age and sex
of the patient, and the suspected ADR, were extracted
from the database. Reported ADRs were classified into
the categories “non-serious” and “serious” based on inter-
national criteria. The latter included fatal outcome, life-
threatening, requiring (prolongation of) hospitalisation,
resulting in significant disability/incapacity, and other
medically important conditions. All other ADRs were
classified as nonserious (European Medicines Agency,
2009).
We report the serious and most often reported ADRs.
In selected cases, we reassessed the causality of the
reported drug reactions based on the Naranjo score.
Moreover, the reporting odds ratio (ROR) was calculated
for selected associations.
The Naranjo score is a quantitative method for deter-
mining the likelihood that an ADR is due to the drug
(Naranjo et al. 1981). The ROR compares the rate of
reporting a specific adverse effect in a drug with the rate
of reporting the same adverse effect in all other drugs.
The ROR is calculated by the following division: the
numerator is the number of cases in which montelukast
was used and a specific ADR was reported divided by
the number of cases using montelukast in which this
ADR was not reported; the denominator is the number
of pediatric and adult cases using other suspected drugs,
reporting a specific ADR divided by the number of cases
using
other
suspected
drugs
without
reporting
that
specific ADR. It is expressed as a point estimate with
corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Fur-
thermore, at least three reports have to be present in
the database to compute a reliable ROR (Rothman et al.
2004). We calculated RORs for ADRs associated with
montelukast based on the whole database and a separate
ROR restricted to children <19 years of age. The ROR
offers insight into disproportionality of an association,
not into causality.
For the global database VigiBase�, we obtained num-
bers of reports and disproportionality (ROR) per reported
association,
both
in
adults
and
children
through
VigiLyze�, which is a search and analysis tool (available
to member countries of the WHO Program for Interna-
tional Drug Monitoring).
Because no patients were involved, we did not ask the
Institutional Review Board for approval.
Results

In
the
Dutch
spontaneous
reporting
database,
331
reports on ADRs after montelukast were present of
which 124 (37.5%) were reported in men and 203
(61.3%) in women. In 4 cases (1.2%), the gender was
unknown. In almost a third (107; 32.3%), the reports
concerned individuals aged between 0 and 18 years and
in 214 cases (64.7%), adults aged 19 years and older. In
10 cases of ADRs (3%) age was not reported. Of all
reports, 45 (13.6%) were reported as serious (Table 1).
There were two deaths: a 20-year-old woman with pul-
monary embolism with a doubtful relation between the
use of montelukast and the reaction, and a woman of
unknown age with renal failure with a possible relation
between the use of montelukast and the reaction. In 26
cases, the ADR led to hospitalisation; 10 patients recov-
ered completely, seven patients have not yet recovered,
three patients did not recover, and the recovery status
of six patients was not known; none of them died.
Reasons for hospitalisation were epilepsy, chest pain,
insomnia, movement disorder, toxic skin eruption, neu-
rological disorder, vasculitis, anesthesia, urticaria, gas-
trointestinal tract bleeding, abnormal liver function test,
angioedema, general health deterioration, membranous
lipodystrophy, eosinophilia, coughing, and anaphylactic
reaction. In 16 patients, the adverse event was called

patients had allergic granulomatous angiitis of which six
patients were hospitalised; all patients survived. Their

WHO global ICSR database, VigiBase�
In the global spontaneous reporting database, 17,723
reports on ADRs after montelukast were present of
which 6960 (39.3%) were reported in men and 9732
(54.9%) in women. In 1031 cases (5.8%), the gender was
unknown. Approximately a third (5743; 32.4%) of the
reports concerned individuals aged 0–18 years old. Addi-
tionally, age was not reported in 3,665 cases of ADRs
(20.7%).

Table 3 depicts the most frequent ADRs with RORs for
all cases and for individuals under <19 years of age
reported to both the Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Cen-
ter Lareb and the WHO Global ICSR database, VigiBase�.
As can be observed, depression was reported most fre-
quently in the whole population to the global database,
VigiBase�. The ROR is 6.93 (95% CI: 6.5–7.4). In the
VigiBase�, aggression was reported the most in children
<19 years of age. The ROR in children is 29.77 (95% CI:
27.5–32.2).
The highest RORs were found for aggression (24.99;
95% CI: 23.5–26.6), suicidal ideation (20.4; 95% CI: 19–
22), abnormal behavior (34.05; 95% CI: 31.8–36.5), and
nightmares (22.46; 95% CI: 20.9–24.2).
Other common ADRs in the whole population were
headaches (ROR 1.85; 95% CI: 1.75–1.970), insomnia
(5.08; 95% CI 4.8–5.4), anxiety (5.11; 95% CI: 4.8–5.5),
dyspnea (1.30; 95% CI: 1.20–1.41), dizziness (0.89; 95%

muscle spasms (2.44; 95% CI: 2.17–2.74).
Headaches were most frequently reported to the Dutch
database for both the whole population and children. The
RORs were 2.26 (95% CI: 1.61–3.19) and 3.18 (95% CI: 2.66–
3.70), respectively. Other common ADRs in the whole popu-
lation were aggression, insomnia, anxiety, abnormal behavior,
dyspnea, rash, abdominal pain, and muscle spasms. The RORs
and 95% CIs for these ADRs can be found in Table 3.
To the Dutch and the global database, nightmares were
reported frequently for both children and adults aged
19 years and older. For VigiBase�, the RORs were 22.48
(95% CI: 20.8–24.2) and 78.04 (95% CI: 70.0–87.1) for
the
whole
population
and
children
aged
<19 years,
respectively. For Lareb, the RORs were 19.29 (95% CI:
12.8–29.2) for all cases and 56.72 (95% CI: 56.1–57.4) for
individuals under 19 years of age.
In the VigiBase�, allergic granulomatous angiitis was
reported in 563 patients.
Discussion
In this study, we found several reported adverse drug
events that were deemed serious, and we saw a high
number of patients with allergic granulomatous angiitis in
both the Dutch and the global database. Most of all, we
found a high number of patients with neuropsychiatric
adverse effects.
A fatal outcome was reported in two reported adverse
drug events in the Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Center
database. One patient, a 20-year-old woman, died after
pulmonary embolism, and another woman of unknown
age died due to renal failure. The relation between mon-
telukast and the adverse event in the first patient was
considered doubtful, and in the second patient, the rela-
tion between the use of montelukast and the reaction was
possible. However, due to the limited information in both
reported cases, we cannot confirm that these adverse
events are caused by the use of montelukast. As far as we
could establish, there are no other known cases reported
in the literature nor were pulmonary embolism and renal
failure found in the VigiBase�. Furthermore, we could
not detect a specific pattern in the other reports of seri-
ous ADRs.
Allergic granulomatous angiitis was reported in eight
patients in the Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Center
Lareb and in 563 patients in the WHO Global ICSR data-
base, VigiBase�. Allergic granulomatous angiitis is a rare

Adverse Drug Reactions and Montelukast
 disease, and it is stated that allergic granulomatous angi-
itis will occur in <0.01% of patients treated with mon-
telukast
(Dutch
Farmacotherapeutic
Compass,
2016;
Dutch Children’s Formulary, 2016). Former studies have
revealed that the association between montelukast and
allergic granulomatous angiitis is somewhat doubtful. To
illustrate, Calapai et al. (2014) argued that most of the
patients treated with montelukast who developed symp-
toms
of
allergic
granulomatous
angiitis
were
also
receiving other medications such as corticosteroids or
salbutamol, making the relationship with montelukast
uncertain. Moreover, all patients with allergic granuloma-
tous angiitis only exhibited symptoms after montelukast
had been administered, yet some patients had a decrease
in the intake of oral corticosteroids concomitantly. This
means that the disease could be masked by the use of cor-
ticosteroids and the patient already had angiitis. However,
it has been reported that the symptoms of allergic granu-
lomatous angiitis disappeared in some patients after with-
drawing montelukast. This can be seen regarded as an
argument for a causal relationship.
In an earlier study, it was found that patients treated
with montelukast had a 4.5-fold higher risk of allergic
granulomatous angiitis onset within 3 months. Nonethe-
less, the authors questioned a causal relationship because
there could be confounding by a general escalation of
asthma therapy before allergic granulomatous angiitis
onset (Hauser et al. 2008). We could not find animal
studies in which a relation between allergic granuloma-
tous angiitis was established. Further prospective studies
in larger patient populations are needed to discern the
exact relation between montelukast and the occurrence of
allergic granulomatous angiitis. Until then, patients trea-
ted with montelukast should be followed to detect signs
and symptoms of allergic granulomatous angiitis.
Former studies have provided contradictory reports
on neuropsychiatric adverse events in montelukast users.
In 2009, the US Food and Drug Administration man-
dated a label change for montelukast and other leuko-
triene receptor antagonists to include neuropsychiatric
adverse events (e.g., depression and suicidality) as a
precaution (FDA, 2017). Nonetheless, Ali could not
establish a significant association between montelukast
and neuropsychiatric events in children with asthma
(Ali et al. 2015).
Our data indicate that neuropsychiatric symptoms,
such as depression, aggression, suicidal ideation, abnor-
mal behavior, and nightmares, were significantly fre-
quently reported in children and in adults in both the
Dutch and the global database. The RORs found in these
adverse events were high, pointing to a strong relation-
ship. In addition, although Aldea Perona et al. have
argued
that
more
neuropsychiatric
symptoms
were
reported more frequently in children compared to adults
(Aldea Perona et al. 2016), we cannot confirm this.
In a recent Spanish study, 24 patients (17 children and
seven adults) reported nightmares after montelukast. In
18 patients, the nightmares appeared within the first week
of treatment. In 21 cases, the nightmares rapidly resolved
after montelukast had been discontinued (Cereza et al.
2012). The relatively high ROR indicates a strong statisti-
cal relation between montelukast and nightmares. This
was true for both the Dutch and worldwide population.
Although nightmares are often transient in children, they
can be frightening for both child and parents and can
influence school performance. In adults, sleep disorders
can lead to potential dangerous situations in traffic or
working with machines (Levin and Nielsen 2007; Simor
et al. 2012). This means that the clinician must discuss
the possibility of these adverse events with the patient
and parents.
As a probable mechanism for the development of neu-
ropsychiatric symptoms, it has been postulated that mon-
telukast causes a higher blood-brain permeability and
inhibits the production of neurotransmitters such as sero-
tonin and noradrenalin. Yet, human studies have revealed
that the brain does not express leukotriene receptors
(Singh et al. 2013) and that montelukast may even cause
an inhibition of the blood-brain barrier permeability
(Biber et al. 2009). A reason for the higher incidence of
agitation in children can be that children have more
energy because their symptoms of asthma and/or allergic
rhinitis are being tempered by montelukast and parents
may interpret this as abnormal behavior or aggression (de
Vries and van Hunsel 2016). As of yet, no pathophysio-
logic explanation is found.
It has been established that asthma symptoms are asso-
ciated with depression and a lower quality of life (Gold-
ney et al. 2003). This means that in some cases, the
adverse effect is not a result of the drug but merely a
result of unresolved asthma. Further research is required
to reveal the mechanism for the higher incidence of neu-
ropsychiatric symptoms in patients using montelukast in
comparison with other medications.
The strength of this study is that the study material
consisted of all pediatric and adult ADRs reports on
montelukast located in both the database of the Nether-
lands Pharmacovigilance Center Lareb and the WHO
Global ICSR database, VigiBase�. As far as we are aware,
this is the first study that reports both ADRs in children
and adults extracted from two large databases.
However, underreporting is a limitation of using a sys-
tem of voluntary spontaneous reporting. This entails that
the true occurrence of ADRs associated with montelukast
cannot be extrapolated from these data. On the other
hand, because reporting is voluntary, it will only occur

Adverse Drug Reactions and Montelukast

 when patients, parents, or professionals suspect a correla-
tion. Moreover, a voluntary reporting system provides
early warnings of drug-related harm. Another limitation
of voluntary reporting data is that the causality of the
reported ADRs is not always certain.
Conclusion
This article offers a comprehensive overview of the safety
of montelukast in clinical practice. Serious ADRs include
allergic reactions and chest pain. Although the relation
between allergic granulomatous angiitis and montelukast
is not elucidated, the prescribing physicians should be
alert for signs and symptoms of this rare disease. Severe
neuropsychiatric symptoms can occur after montelukast
in both adults and children for whom montelukast was
prescribed; especially nightmares may occur soon after
starting montelukast.
