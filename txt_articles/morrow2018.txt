IMPORTANCE The American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG) Z0011 study
demonstrated the safety of sentinel node biopsy alone in clinically node-negative women
with metastases in 1 or 2 sentinel nodes treated with breast conservation. Little is known
about surgeon perspectives regarding when axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) can be
omitted.
OBJECTIVES To determine surgeon acceptance of ACOSOG Z0011 findings, identify
characteristics associated with acceptance of ACOSOG Z0011 results, and examine the
association between acceptance of the Society of Surgical Oncology and American Society for
Radiation Oncology negative margin of no ink on tumor and surgeon preference for ALND.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A survey was sent to 488 surgeons treating a
population-based sample of women with early-stage breast cancer (N = 5080). The study
was conducted from July 1, 2013, to August 31, 2015.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Surgeons were categorized as having low, intermediate, or
high propensity for ALND according to the outer quartiles of ALND scale distribution.
A multivariable linear regression model was used to confirm independent associations.
RESULTS Of the 488 surgeons invited to participate, 376 (77.0%) responded and 359
provided complete information regarding propensity for ALND derived from 5 clinical
scenarios. Mean surgeon age was 53.7 (range, 31-80) years; 277 (73.7%) were male; 142
(37.8%) treated 20 or fewer breast cancers annually and 108 (28.7%) treated more than 50.
One hundred seventy-five (49.0%) recommended ALND for 1 macrometastasis. Of
low-propensity surgeons who recommended ALND, only 1 (1.1%) approved ALND for any
nodal metastases compared with 69 (38.6%) and 85 (95.5%) of selective and
high-propensity surgeons (P < .001), respectively. In multivariable analysis, lower ALND
propensity was significantly associated with higher breast cancer volume (21-50: −0.19; 95%
CI, −0.39 to 0.02; >51: −0.48; 95% CI, −0.71 to −0.24; P < .001), recommendation of a
minimal margin width (1-5 mm: −0.10; 95% CI, −0.43 to 0.22; no ink on tumor: −0.53; 95% CI,
−0.82 to −0.24; P < .001), participation in a multidisciplinary tumor board (1%-9%: −0.25;
95% CI, −0.55 to 0.05; >9%: −0.37; 95% CI, −0.63 to −0.11; P = .02), and Los Angeles
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results site (−0.18; 95% CI, −0.35 to −0.01; P = .04).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study shows substantial variation in surgeon acceptance
of more limited surgery for breast cancer, which is associated with higher breast cancer
volume and multidisciplinary interactions, suggesting the potential for overtreatment of
many patients and the need for education targeting lower-volume breast surgeons.

hanges in our understanding of the biology of breast
cancer, the development of effective targeted sys-
temic therapies, and the use of systemic therapy for the
majority of small, node-negative breast cancers have altered
the landscape of the surgical management of breast cancer in
recent years. The American College of Surgeons Oncology
Group(ACOSOG)Z0011trialwasapractice-changingstudythat
demonstrated no significant differences in locoregional recur-
rence, disease-free survival, or overall survival in women
with clinically node-negative breast cancer with metastases
in 1 or 2 sentinel nodes (SNs) who were treated with breast-
conserving surgery with whole-breast irradiation and random-
ized to axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) or sentinel node
biopsy(SNB)alone.1Subsequentprospectiverandomizedtrials
have demonstrated that ALND may be safely omitted in clini-
cally node-negative patients with micrometastases in the SNs
(International Breast Cancer Study Group [IBCSG] 23-01)2 or
when axillary irradiation is given after SNB alone (After Map-
ping of the Axilla: Radiotherapy or Surgery? [AMAROS] trial).3
In 2014, the Society of Surgical Oncology (SSO) and the
American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) published
a guideline recommending no ink on tumor as an adequate
margin for patients treated with lumpectomy and whole-
breast irradiation,4 which was associated with a 16% de-
creaseinadditionalsurgeryuseafterinitiallumpectomywithin
2 years of guideline dissemination.5 The concept underlying
both the omission of ALND and use of smaller negative-
margin widths is the same, namely, that the systemic therapy
and radiotherapy given to women undergoing breast-
conserving surgery are contributors to local control and al-
low more limited, less-morbid surgical approaches.
Although new treatments with small incremental ben-
efits are often embraced by the medical community, studies
supporting the use of less therapy have been adopted more
slowly.6-8 The ACOSOG Z0011,1 AMAROS,3 and IBCSG 23-01
trials2 provide high-quality evidence that ALND is no longer
necessary for all women with SLN metastases, but little is
known about current surgeon attitudes toward ALND and ac-
ceptance of omission of ALND in patients meeting clinical trial
eligibility criteria. Herein, we examine surgeon perspectives
regarding clinical circumstances in which ALND could be omit-
ted and identify characteristics of surgeons associated with ap-
proval of omission of ALND in appropriate clinical circum-
stances. In addition, to determine whether these perspectives
were particular to management of the ALNs or reflective of
more general attitudes toward less surgical therapy, we exam-
ined the association between acceptance of the SSO-ASTRO
minimal negative-margin width of no ink on tumor and sur-
geon propensity for ALND.
Methods
Sampling and Data Collection
The Individualized Cancer Care study is a population-based
survey of patients with early-stage breast cancer and their
clinicians. Women aged 20 to 79 years with ductal carcinoma
in situ and stages I and II breast cancer who underwent de-
finitive surgical therapy were identified using rapid case as-
certainment from the Georgia and Los Angeles County Sur-
veillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registries
between July 1, 2013, and August 31, 2015. Of the initial 7810
women selected, 7303 were eligible and 5080 patients re-
sponded (69.6% of those eligible). Patients were asked to iden-
tify their attending surgeon; 4755 (93.6%) did so. The 488 sur-
geons were mailed surveys toward the end of the patient data
collection period; 376 (77.0%) responded. A modified Dill-
man method9 was used to maximize response. Surgeons were
mailed a packet containing an introductory letter, the survey,
and a cash gift. A second survey was mailed to nonrespon-
dents 4 weeks later, followed by a telephone call 4 weeks
after that. A third survey was mailed to nonrespondents.
The surgeon questionnaire content was extensively pre-
tested, as done in prior clinician surveys conducted by our
team, and included (1) demographic/practice information, (2)
scenario-based queries of attitudes about testing and treat-
ment strategies, and (3) attitudes about patient communica-
tion and decision making.10 This study was approved by the
UniversityofMichiganInstitutionalReviewBoardandtheneed
for written consent was waived, as survey completion was be-
lieved to constitute consent.
Measures
The dependent variable—surgeon propensity to recommend
ALND—was derived from 5 short clinical scenarios that were
presentedtothesurveyedsurgeons.Thescenariosqueriedsur-
geon recommendation of ALND for a case typical of those
included in the ACOSOG Z0011 and other trials. The case pre-
sented was a 48-year-old woman with clinically node-
negative cancer with a 1.5-cm, palpable, grade 3, infiltrating
ductal carcinoma, estrogen receptor (ER) positive, progester-
one receptor (PR) positive, and HER2 negative, undergoing
lumpectomy and SNB. Surgeons were asked, “In a case like
this, would you recommend axillary dissection for (1) iso-
lated tumor cells in 1 SN, (2) micrometastases in 1 SN, (3) mi-
crometastases in 2 SNs, (4) macrometastases in 1 SN, and (5)
macrometastases in 2 SNs?” Response categories for each item
Key Points
Question Have surgeons accepted sentinel node biopsy alone for
axillary management in patients undergoing breast-conserving
surgery?
Findings In this survey of 376 surgeons, 49% would definitely or
probably recommend axillary dissection for 1 sentinel node
macrometastasis and 63% would definitely or probably
recommend axillary dissection for 2 sentinel node
macrometastases. In multivariable analysis, a lower propensity for
axillary dissection was significantly associated with treatment of
more breast cancer cases, acceptance of a lumpectomy margin of
no ink on tumor, multidisciplinary tumor board participation, and
Los Angeles Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results site.
Meaning The potential for overtreatment identified in this study
indicates the need for education targeted toward lower-volume
breast surgeons.

 were: definitely yes, probably yes, probably no, and defi-
nitely no. Item responses were fit by a graded item response
model to create a latent scale, with greater value indicating
higher surgeon propensity to recommend ALND.11 Scale val-
ueswerecalculatedfor359ofthe376respondingsurgeonswith
sufficient item information.
Additional measures of surgeon attitudes toward aspects
of surgical management were evaluated in this study. For the
48-year-old woman in the case presentation above, we asked
surgeonswhetherthey:(1)wouldrecommendALNDinthesce-
nario of macrometastases in 3 SNs, (2) would say that “ALND
should be done for any SN macrometatases” when discussing
axillary management, and (3) would recommend a frozen sec-
tion of the SN in such a case. Surgeons were also questioned
if, for a patient undergoing mastectomy, they agreed that,
“There is an option to omit ALND for macrometastasis in 1 or
2 SNs even if radiation therapy is not given.
” The response cat-
egories for these measures again ranged from definitely yes to
definitely no. Surgeons were also asked whether they thought
they performed ALND less often, about the same, or more
often than other surgeons treating breast cancer in their
community.
Last, we evaluated surgeon acceptance of a lumpectomy
margin of no ink on tumor for invasive cancer in accordance
with new guidelines.4 The case scenario referenced for this
question was a 60-year-old woman with a 0.8-cm mass in the
upper quadrant of a large breast and a core biopsy showing
grade 3 infiltrating ductal carcinoma, ER/PR positive/HER2
negative, who received a lumpectomy and SNB to be fol-
lowedbywhole-breastirradiation.Surgeonswereasked,“What
negative margin width precludes the need for re-excision af-
ter lumpectomy with radiation?” with allowable responses of
tumorcellsnottouchingtheink,greaterthan1to2mm,greater
than 5 mm, and greater than 1 cm. Other surgeon measures in-
cluded number of years in practice, sex, breast cancer patient
volume, percentage of newly diagnosed breast cancer pa-
tients discussed in a multidisciplinary meeting, and geo-
graphic practice site.
Statistical Analysis
We first described surgeon demographic and practice factors
ofinterest(Table).Wethenevaluatedsurgeons’reportsoftheir
recommendation of ALND for the 5 clinical SNB scenarios. Fol-
lowing development of the 5-item scale for propensity to rec-
ommend ALND, surgeons were scored and categorized as hav-
ing low, selective, or high propensity for recommending ALND
using the outer quartiles of the ALND scores. We then exam-
ined the distribution of the ALND propensity groups by sur-
geon’
s annual breast cancer patient volume. We also assessed
the distribution of ALND propensity groups by surgeon’
s re-
ported negative margin needed to avoid re-excision follow-
ing lumpectomy and irradiation in a 60-year-old woman with
an ER/PR-positive tumor. Finally, we used a multivariable lin-
ear regression model to confirm the independent association
between surgeon ALND propensity and breast cancer patient
volume, controlling for geographic site, sex, years in practice,
percentage of patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer
discussed in a multidisciplinary meeting, and preferred nega-
tive margin. All analyses were conducted using SAS, version
9.4 (SAS Institute Inc). PROC GLM was used for multivariable
linear regression. All statistical tests were 2-sided, with con-
fidence at the 95% level; χ2 tests were used to determine sta-
tisticalsignificanceforalldifferencesinproportions,andFand
t tests were used for linear regression effects.
Results
The Table summarizes the characteristics of the 376 respond-
ing surgeons; data on some variables were missing. The mean
surgeon age was 53.7 years (range, 31-80) and 92 (24.5%) were
women. Practice volume was varied, with 142 (37.8%) of re-
spondents treating 0 to 20 breast cancer cases per year, and
108 (28.7%) treating more than 50 breast cancer cases per year.
Although women constituted only 24.5% of the study partici-
pants, they represented 52.4% of the high-volume surgeons.
Substantial variation in report of recommendations for
ALND was observed in response to the clinical scenarios
(eFigure 1 in the Supplement). Surgeons were least likely to
recommend ALND for patients with isolated tumor cells or mi-
crometastases in a single SN, with 12.7% and 12.6% of sur-
geons, respectively, probably or definitely recommending

 ALND for this minimal volume nodal disease. When a single
nodal macrometastasis was present, 175 (49.0%) of the sur-
geons would definitely or probably recommend ALND, and for
patients with macrometastasis in 2 nodes, 221 (62.6%) would
recommend ALND.
Using outer quartiles of the ALND scale values, surgeons
were categorized into low (89 [25%]), selective (181 [50%]),
or high (89 [25%]) ALND propensity groups. Of surgeons
who responded to the 5 items or questions from which the
scale was created asking whether ALND should be done for
any SN macrometastases, 1 of the 87 (1.1%) low ALND pro-
pensity group surgeons said that ALND should definitely or
probably be done for any SN macrometastases compared
with 69 (38.6%) of the selective ALND group (n = 179) and 85
(95.5%) of the high (n = 89) ALND propensity surgeons
(P < .001). In addition, when asked whether they would rec-
ommend an intraoperative frozen section of the SN, 25
(28.7%) of responding surgeons in the low (n = 87) ALND
propensity group would recommend the procedure com-
pared with 78 (44.1%) of selective (n = 177) ALND propensity
surgeons and 77 (86.5%) of high (n = 89) ALND propensity
surgeons (P < .001).
Figure 1 shows the percentage of surgeons in each pro-
pensity group by breast cancer patient volume (n = 346).
Forty-three of the 105 (41.0%) high-volume total surgeons
(>50 cases/y) had a low propensity for ALND compared with
19 of 133 (14.3%) of low-volume surgeons (≤20 cases/y). Con-
versely, 40% of low-volume surgeons had a high propensity
for ALND compared with 9% of high-volume surgeons. Sur-
geons with a high propensity for ALND were also less likely
to accept lumpectomy margins of no ink on tumor
(Figure 2). In the scenario of a 60-year-old woman with an
ER/PR-positive, HER2-negative clinical T1bN0 cancer, 85%
of respondents with a low propensity for ALND believed that
a margin of no ink on tumor definitely or probably precluded
the need for re-excision compared with 128 of 178 (71.9%) of
those with a selective propensity for ALND and 40 of 88
(45.5%) responding surgeons with a high propensity for
ALND.
A minority of surgeons appeared to extrapolate the re-
sults of clinical trials eliminating ALND in patients who did not
meet trial selection criteria for whom guidelines continue to
recommend ALND. Twenty-eight (7.8%) of surgeons did not
recommend ALND for macrometastases in 3 SNs in a patient
having breast-conserving therapy (BCT), and 2 (0.6%) stated
that there was definitely an option to omit ALND in patients
undergoing mastectomy without planned radiotherapy; 33
(9.2%) stated there was probably that option. Surgeons with
a high propensity for ALND had a high level of awareness that
they perform the procedure more frequently than their peers
(eFigure 2 in the Supplement). High ALND propensity sur-
geons composed only 5.8% of the group who stated they per-
formed ALND less frequently than their peers and 55.6% of the
group who believed that they performed ALND more fre-
quently than other surgeons.
Results of a multivariable linear regression analysis of
factors associated with surgeon propensity for ALND are
shown in eFigure 3 in the Supplement. The dependent vari-
able, surgeon ALND propensity, had a mean (SD) of 0.04
(0.86) (range, −1.20 to 2.11) with lower scores indicating a
lower propensity to recommend ALND and higher scores
indicating a greater propensity to recommend ALND in the
clinical case scenario. After adjustment for other factors,
lower propensity to use ALND was significantly associated
with higher annual patient volume (21-50: −0.19; 95% CI,
−0.39 to 0.02; >51: −0.48; 95% CI, −0.71 to −0.24; P < .001),
surgeon recommendation of minimal margin width (no ink
on tumor) (1-5 mm: −0.10; 95% CI, −0.43 to 0.22; no ink on
tumor: −0.53; 95% CI, −0.82 to −0.24; P < .001), higher pro-
portion of cases being discussed in a multidisciplinary tumor
board (1%-9%: −0.25; 95% CI, −0.55 to 0.05; >9%: −0.37; 95%
CI, −0.63 to −0.11; P = .02), and Los Angeles County SEER site
(−0.18; 95% CI, −0.35 to −0.01; P = .04).

 Discussion
We have demonstrated variation among surgeons in omis-
sionofALND,withamajorityofsurgeonsrecommendingelimi-
nation of ALND for isolated tumor cells and micrometasta-
ses, but approximately half continuing to favor ALND for SN
macrometastases. This is evidence of the potential for over-
treatmentinmanypatientsbasedondatafromprospectiveran-
domized trials indicating that ALND does not improve out-
comes in these clinical scenarios.1-3 In a prospective study
performed at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center of 793
consecutive women meeting ACOSOG Z0011 eligibility crite-
ria and found to have SN metastases, ALND was avoided in
84%,12suggestingthatthewidespreadadoptionoftheACOSOG
Z0011, AMAROS, and IBCSG 23-01 results could substantially
decrease the burden of breast cancer treatment. The use of
ALND for isolated tumor cells is particularly concerning be-
cause such patients are classified as node-negative in the
American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system.13 This
level of variation in a heterogeneous surgeon sample likely re-
flectsthegenerallyslowacceptanceoflesssurgicaltherapyand
the controversy that surrounded the ACOSOG Z0011 trial when
it was initially published. Despite 6 prospective randomized
trials supporting the safety of BCT and a 1990 National Insti-
tutesofHealthconsensuspanelrecommendingitsuse,14fewer
than 50% of women with early-stage breast cancer treated in
1994 underwent BCT,8 and rates of use did not peak until
2005.15 When ACOSOG Z0011 was initially published in 2011,
concerns were raised regarding the representativeness of the
patient population as well as the safety of eliminating ALND
in younger women and those with HER2 overexpressing or
triple-negative breast cancers, and the 6.3-year median fol-
low-up was believed to be too short for a population of women
with ER-positive breast cancer in whom late recurrences are
frequent.16,17 Our survey was conducted prior to the publica-
tion of the 10-year outcomes of ACOSOG Z0011,18 which con-
firmed no significant differences in local control or survival
based on the performance of ALND, and it is possible that these
mature data may lead to greater acceptance of omission of
ALND among surgeons.
Ourfindingsalsoindicatedifferencesinacceptanceofmore
limited surgical approaches among surgeons based on vol-
ume of breast cancer cases seen annually. Lower-volume sur-
geons were less likely to omit ALND and more likely to favor
obtaining margins more widely clear than no ink on tumor in
patients having BCT despite a 2014 meta-analysis and multi-
disciplinary guideline approved by the SSO, ASTRO, Ameri-
can Society of Clinical Oncology, and American Society of
Breast Surgeons recommending no ink on tumor as an ad-
equate margin for patients undergoing lumpectomy with
whole-breast irradiation.4 It is possible that the conceptual
basis for the smaller surgical procedures or the body of evi-
dencesupportingthemislesswellknowntolower-volumesur-
geons,indicatinganeedforeducationtargetingthisgroup.Pre-
sentation of cases at a multidisciplinary tumor board was an
independent variable associated with decreased ALND use,
providing a practical avenue for surgeons not fully comfort-
able with omission of ALND to discuss when it is appropriate
to adopt this practice.
In addition to continued recommendation of ALND in situ-
ations where it is not warranted, such as patients with iso-
lated tumor cells, micrometastases, or macrometastases in 1
to 2 SNs who are undergoing breast-conserving surgery with
whole-breast irradiation, we also found evidence of extrapo-
lation of existing evidence to clinical circumstances not ad-
dressed in randomized trials. Twenty-eight (7.8%) percent of
surgeons would definitely or probably omit ALND for macro-
metastases in 3 or more SNs in a patient having BCT; this fact
is evidence of undertreatment, as, to our knowledge, no data
exist to support the safety of this practice. In ACOSOG Z0011,1
the presence of macrometastases in 3 or more SNs was an
indication for ALND, and in the AMAROS trial,3 only 5% of
randomized patients had metastases to 3 or more SNs. Omis-
sion of ALND for patients with SN macrometastases under-
going mastectomy without radiotherapy was considered
definitely or probably an option by 10% of the respondents,
despite the fact that this scenario was not included in
ACOSOG Z00111 or AMAROS3 and is being addressed in an
ongoing clinical trial.16
Strengths and Limitations
Strengths of this study include the diverse sample of attend-
ing surgeons drawn from a contemporary population-based
sample of patients from 2 large regions of the United States,
thehighsurgeonresponserate,andourabilitytoexamineboth
practice attributes and surgeon attitudes toward clinically rel-
evant scenarios commonly encountered in clinical practice.
However, there were limitations. We relied on surgeon re-
ports of whether or not they would perform ALND and did not
have actual utilization data. Results were limited to surgeons
who treated patients in Georgia and Los Angeles County.
Conclusions
Our findings have implications for clinical practice and health
policy. Although ALND and SNB are both outpatient surgical
procedures with a negligible risk of perioperative mortality,
ALNDisalongeroperationthanSNB,withasignificantlyhigher
riskofperioperativecomplications19andtheirassociatedcosts.
ALND is also associated with a longer period of disability for
patients and, most significantly, a higher lifetime risk of
lymphedema.19,20 Patients report that lymphedema is the
most-feared long-term consequence of breast cancer treat-
ment, and behaviors adopted to minimize the risk of lymph-
edema may interfere with employment or negatively affect
quality of life.21 As demonstrated in our study, the decision to
perform ALND is usually made with an intraoperative frozen
section by surgeons with a high propensity for ALND, so in-
terventions to reduce the use of ALND must take place prior
to surgery. Women with clinically node-negative cancer un-
dergoing BCT with whole-breast irradiation who are advised
that ALND is routine for the finding of any SN metastases
should seek a second opinion or reserve consent for ALND un-
til final surgical pathologic test results are available to ensure

 a complete discussion of the alternatives to ALND when SN
metastases are present.
Educational programs targeting surgeons treating lower
volumes of breast cancer, as well as their counterparts in ra-
diation oncology and medical oncology that clearly articulate
the available evidence in this area and define patient selec-
tion criteria for lesser surgical approaches, should be devel-
oped to avoid both harmful overtreatment and undertreat-
ment. Appropriate axillary management now varies based on
clinical nodal status, number of SNs containing metastases,
choice of lumpectomy or mastectomy, and whether neoadju-
vanttherapyisgiven.Developmentofanevidence-based,prac-
tical guideline outlining acceptable alternatives to ALND in
these patient subgroups should be a priority.
