IMPORTANCE Unintentional weight loss has been associated with risk of dementia. Because
mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a prodromal stage for dementia, we sought to evaluate
whether changes in weight and body mass index (BMI) may predict incident MCI.
OBJECTIVE To investigate the association of change in weight and BMI with risk of MCI.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A population-based, prospective study of participants
70 years of age or older from the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging, which was initiated on October
1, 2004. Maximum weight and height in midlife (40-65 years of age) were retrospectively
ascertained from the medical records of participants using a medical records–linkage system.
The statistical analyses were performed between January and November 2015.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Participants were evaluated for cognitive outcomes of
normal cognition, MCI, or dementia at baseline and prospectively assessed for incident
events at each 15-month evaluation. The association of rate of change in weight and BMI with
risk of MCI was investigated using proportional hazards models.
RESULTS Over a mean follow-up of 4.4 years, 524 of 1895 cognitively normal participants
developed incident MCI (50.3% were men; mean age, 78.5 years). The mean (SD) rate of
weight change per decade from midlife to study entry was greater for participants who
developed incident MCI vs those who remained cognitively normal (−2.0 [5.1] vs −1.2 [4.9] kg;
P = .006). A greater decline in weight per decade was associated with an increased risk of
incident MCI (hazard ratio [HR], 1.04 [95% CI, 1.02-1.06]; P < .001) after adjusting for sex,
education, and apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele. A weight loss of 5 kg per decade
corresponds to a 24% increase in risk of MCI (HR, 1.24). A higher decrease in BMI per decade
was also associated with incident MCI (HR, 1.08 [95% CI, 1.03-1.13]; P = .003).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These findings suggest that increasing weight loss per decade
from midlife to late life is a marker for MCI and may help identify persons at increased risk
for MCI.

M
ild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a prodromal stage
of dementia that provides us with the opportunity
to study risk factors for dementia and to identify
persons at increased risk of dementia. Approximately 5% to
15% of persons with MCI will progress to dementia per
year.1,2 Therefore, the delay or prevention of MCI could also
reduce the public health impact of dementia. Several modi-
fiable risk factors are associated with an increased risk of
MCI, including education, vascular risk factors, and related
outcomes.1
Changes in body mass index (BMI, calculated as weight in
kilograms divided by height in meters squared) and weight are
also associated with increased risk of dementia, but, overall,
the findings of different studies have been inconclusive. Some
studies have reported associations of lower late-life BMI and
faster decline in weight or BMI in late life with increased
risk of dementia3-7; others suggest that being overweight at
older ages,8 central obesity in midlife,9 or higher midlife
BMI10,11 increase the risk of dementia and Alzheimer
dementia. In contrast, one study12 found that being under-
weight or overweight in midlife may increase the risk of
dementia in late life. Furthermore, other investigators have
reported that obesity in midlife is associated with a
decreased risk of cognitive decline and dementia,13 or they
have not observed a predictive role of high BMI in late life
for cognitive decline.14 The association of BMI with MCI is
even less certain. Few investigators have observed a decline
in BMI prior to a diagnosis of MCI.15,16 The association of
declining weight and BMI with MCI may have implications
for preventive strategies for MCI. The objective of our study
was to examine associations of longitudinal changes in
weight and BMI with incident MCI among participants in
the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging.
Methods
Study Participants
The study design and method have been previously
published17-19 and are only briefly described herein. Partici-
pants were enrolled in the population-based Mayo Clinic Study
of Aging established in Olmsted County, Minnesota. At the ini-
tiation of the study, a sampling frame of Olmsted County resi-
dents who were 70 to 89 years of age on October 1, 2004 (with
a total population of 9953), was constructed using the medi-
cal records–linkage system of the Rochester Epidemiology
Project.17 Participants were randomly selected from this sam-
pling frame, and those who were eligible (ie, without demen-
tia or in hospice care) were recruited to the study. Recruit-
ment is ongoing to maintain the sample size, and participants
are seen every 15 months. The present study includes partici-
pants who were cognitively normal at the baseline evalua-
tion, had at least 1 follow-up evaluation, and had data on maxi-
mum weight and height in midlife (40-65 years of age; mean
age, 58.6). Our study was approved by the institutional re-
view boards of the Mayo Clinic and the Olmsted Medical Cen-
ter. Written informed consent was obtained from each partici-
pant prior to participation.
Participant Evaluation
Participants were evaluated by a nurse or a study coordinator
who assessed their memory and administered the Clinical
Dementia Rating scale20 and the Functional Activities
Questionnaire21 to the participant’
s informant. Each partici-
pant underwent neuropsychological testing using 9 tests to
assess performance in 4 cognitive domains: memory, execu-
tive function, language, and visuospatial skills.18,19,22,23 Par-
ticipants also underwent a neurological evaluation by a
physician.
Identification of MCI/Dementia
The nurse or the study coordinator, the physician who
evaluated the participant, and a neuropsychologist
reviewed all data collected for each participant. A diagnosis
of MCI, dementia, or normal cognition was made by
consensus.18 Participants were classified as cognitively nor-
mal if they performed in the normative range and did not
meet criteria for MCI24 or for dementia.25 Incident MCI
cases were classified as amnestic MCI if the memory domain
was impaired or nonamnestic MCI if the memory domain
was not impaired.26
Assessment of Weight, Height, and BMI at Baseline and
Follow-up Evaluations
Weight and height were measured at each evaluation, and BMI
was computed. The maximum weight and height in midlife
(mean age, 58.6 years) were ascertained from the medical rec-
ord of each participant by trained nurse abstractors using the
medical records–linkage system of the Rochester Epidemiol-
ogy Project.
Assortment of Other Covariates
Demographicvariables(includingage,sex,andeducation)were
obtained at the baseline visit for each participant. A history of
type 2 diabetes, hypertension, coronary heart disease, and
stroke were abstracted from the medical records at baseline
and during follow-up. Depressive symptoms were assessed
with the Beck Depression Inventory. History of cigarette smok-
ing (never, former, or current) and diagnosed alcohol prob-
lemswereassessedfromself-report.Currentmedicationswere
assessedfromthemedicationbottlesateachevaluation.Geno-
typing was performed to determine apolipoprotein E ε4
(APOE*E4) carrier status at baseline.
Key Points
Question: Is there a loss of weight prior to the diagnosis of mild
cognitive impairment (MCI) as observed with Alzheimer dementia?
Findings: In a prospective, population-based, cohort study of 1895
cognitively normal persons 70 years of age or older at enrollment,
a greater loss of weight per decade from midlife to late life was
significantly associated with an increased risk of incident MCI.
Meaning: Increasing weight loss per decade from midlife to late
life is a marker for MCI and may help identify persons at increased
risk for MCI.

Statistical Analysis
All cognitively normal participants at baseline were consid-
ered at risk for incident MCI. Onset of MCI was assigned at the
midpoint between the last assessment as cognitively normal
and the first-ever assessment as having MCI. Persons who de-
veloped dementia without an intervening MCI diagnosis were
presumed to have had an undetected MCI phase. We com-
puted the follow-up duration from baseline to MCI onset for
incident cases and through the date of the last follow-up for
participants who remained cognitively normal. Participants
whorefusedtoparticipate,whocouldnotbecontacted,orwho
died during follow-up were censored at their last evaluation.
We computed the rate of weight change (kilograms per
decade) from the maximum weight in midlife through follow-
up, including late-life weight measurements as a time-
dependent variable. We investigated the association of weight
change with incident MCI using the Cox proportional hazards
model and reported hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs; in sepa-
rate models, we included maximum weight in midlife or
late-life weight. We examined confounding by APOE*E4,
diabetes, hypertension, stroke, and cigarette smoking, with
each variable added separately, and effect modification by
age, sex, and APOE*E4 by including interaction terms of
these covariates with rate of weight change.
The multivariable models were as follows: Model 1 in-
cluded sex (where applicable), education, and APOE*E4 geno-
type (APOE*E4 carrier vs noncarrier), and model 2 included
the model 1 variables and the following potential confound-
ers: alcohol problem (yes vs no), depressive symptoms (Beck
Depression Inventory score of ≥16), use of statins, diabetes, hy-
pertension, coronary heart disease, cigarette smoking (never
vs former or current), and stroke.
Wealsoexaminedtheeffectofincludingheightinthemod-
els. In a separate model, we included both maximum weight
in midlife and late-life weight, but not weight change, in the
same model and examined the associations with MCI. We
repeated the analyses using rate of change in BMI (unit/
decade). All hypothesis testing was conducted assuming an
α = .05 significance level and a 2-sided alternative hypoth-
esis. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS, ver-
sion 9.3 (SAS Institute).
Results
The characteristics of the 1895 cognitively normal partici-
pants at baseline (50.3% men; mean age, 78.5 years) are
summarized by sex in Table 1. Men had a higher frequency of
former or current smoking (61.2% vs 36.0%; P < .001), diabe-
tes (20.4% vs 14.3%; P = .001), and coronary artery disease
(49.2% vs 29.1%; P < .001) than women. Women had a non-
significantly greater mean rate of weight change per decade
from midlife to study entry compared with men, but a lower
mean maximum weight and a lower mean BMI in midlife com-
pared with men.
Over a mean (SD) follow-up of 4.4 (2.4) years, 524 partici-
pants developed incident MCI (Table 2). Participants who de-
veloped incident MCI were older, more likely to be carriers of
APOE*E4, and more likely to have diabetes, hypertension,
stroke, or coronary artery disease compared with partici-
pantswhoremainedcognitivelynormal.Themean(SD)weight
change was greater for participants who developed incident
MCIthanforthosewhoremainedcognitivelynormal(−2.0[5.1]
vs −1.2 [4.9] kg; P = .006). The mean (SD) loss of weight per

decade was greater in men who developed incident MCI than
in men who did not (−2.1 [5.3] vs −1.0 [4.6] kg; P = .02) but was
similar for women who developed incident MCI and women
who did not (−1.9 [4.8] vs −1.5 [5.3]; P = .12).
A loss of weight from midlife was associated with an in-
creased risk of incident MCI after adjustment for sex, educa-
tion, and APOE*E4 (Table 3, model 1). Based on our propor-
tionalhazardsmodels,aweightlossof5kg/decadecorresponds
to a 24% increase in risk of MCI (HR, 1.24). Table 3 also de-
scribes the effects of adjusting for maximum midlife weight
and weight in late life, separately or simultaneously, in mod-
els with or without weight change.
When maximum midlife weight and late-life weight were
included in the same model as weight change, neither was sig-
nificantly associated with MCI, but weight change remained
significantly associated with MCI. However, when both maxi-
mum midlife weight and late-life weight, but not weight
change, were included in the same model, a higher maxi-
mum midlife weight and a low late-life weight were associ-
ated with an increased risk of MCI. Consistent with results for
weight change, a greater decrease in BMI per decade (ie, unit
decrease) was associated with an increased risk of MCI (HR,
1.08 [95% CI, 1.03-1.13]; P = .003), but the model fit was bet-
ter using weight change.
When we simultaneously adjusted for potential confound-
ers, the associations of weight change with MCI persisted
(Table3,model2).However,simultaneouslyadjustingforthese
variables in a multivariable model with weight change could
result in overcontrolling because these conditions are in the
causal pathway from obesity to cognitive impairment.
There was no significant interaction of sex with weight
change; however, given the higher risk of MCI in men than
womeninourcohort,wehavereportedresultsbysex(Table3).
The effect sizes were greater in men than in women. There was
a significant interaction between age and maximum midlife
weight with regard to MCI risk (P = .02 for interaction). The as-
sociationsofa5-kgdifferenceinmaximummidlifeweightwith
MCI were stronger for persons older at baseline (HR, 1.05 [95%
CI, 1.01-1.10] for those 70-74 years of age [P = .03]; HR, 1.07
[95% CI, 1.03-1.12] for those 75-79 years of age [P = .001]; HR,
1.08 [95% CI, 1.04-1.12] for those 80-84 years of age [P < .001];
and HR, 1.09 [95% CI, 1.04-1.14] for those ≥85 years of age
[P < .001]). There was no interaction of vascular risk factors
with weight change (data are not presented).
The Figure illustrates interrelationships of midlife weight,
weight change, and MCI risk. There is no association of midlife
weight with MCI after weight change is taken into account. The
Figure demonstrates that the slopes for the 4 quartiles of
midlife weight do not significantly differ. For persons in the
upper midlife weight quartile (ie, the fourth quartile), the risk
of MCI increased by 39% (HR, 1.39 [95% CI, 1.02-1.82]) for a
weightchangeof−10kg/decade.Forpersonsinthelowestquar-
tile (ie, the first quartile), the risk of MCI increased by 78% (HR,
1.78 [95% CI, 0.99-3.21]) for a decrease of −10 kg/decade. The
corresponding increases in risk of MCI per −10 kg/decade were
69% (HR, 1.69 [95% CI, 1.04-2.74]) for the second quartile and
61% (HR, 1.61 [95% CI, 1.08-2.38]) for the third quartile. Thus,
there is no significant interaction between midlife weight and
weight change in determining the risk of MCI (P = .80). Simi-
larly, there was no significant difference in the intercepts of
the 4 lines based on the general test comparing the 4 groups
(P = .47); that is, after taking into account the rate of weight
change, we found that there was no significant contribution
of midlife weight to incident MCI. The specific test directly
comparing the slopes in the upper and lower quartiles was not
significant(P = .43).Whenwestudiedtheassociationofweight

change with MCI subtypes separately, we found that weight
change was significantly associated with amnestic MCI but not
with nonamnestic MCI (Table 4), which suggests that loss of
weight may involve Alzheimer dementia–related mecha-
nisms.
Discussion
The results of this population-based elderly cohort study dem-
onstrate that a higher rate of weight loss from midlife to late
life and a lower weight in late life are markers of risk for MCI.
A greater rate of weight loss or decrease in BMI from midlife
to late life was associated with an increased risk of MCI. After
takingintoaccountrateofweightchange,wefoundthatmidlife
weight and late-life weight do not contribute to risk of MCI.
However, without accounting for rate of change in weight, we
found that a higher maximum weight in midlife is associated
with an increased risk of MCI and that lower weight in late life
is also associated with an increased risk of MCI.
The association of greater weight loss with MCI suggests
that weight loss may be a marker for risk of MCI. While weight
loss may not be causally related to MCI, we hypothesize that
weight loss may represent a prodromal stage or an early mani-
festation of MCI. Consistent with this, there was no interac-
tion of weight loss with midlife weight; even among persons
who were of normal weight in midlife, a greater weight loss
was associated with an increased risk of MCI in late life.
An important strength of our study is the ability to assess
maximum midlife weight from the medical records of partici-
pants and from direct measurements in late life. From these
measurements, we demonstrated that the age at which
weight is assessed is important when investigating the asso-
ciation of weight with risk of MCI. Specifically, when we

simultaneously considered maximum midlife and late-life
weight in the same model, a higher maximum midlife weight
and lower weight in late life were both associated with inci-
dent MCI. However, our findings suggest that weight loss is
the key weight-related marker of incident MCI in the elderly.
The association of weight loss per decade with incident MCI
was stronger than estimates for maximum midlife weight or
for low weight in late life when these latter variables were
simultaneously considered.
Our findings for MCI are consistent with the findings of
other prospective studies that correlated weight loss with the
increased risk of dementia. In a study of controls for a demen-
tia cohort, greater weight loss preceded the diagnosis of Alz-
heimer dementia.27 In a community-dwelling elderly cohort,
men and women who developed probable or possible Alzhei-
mer dementia experienced significant weight loss preceding
the diagnosis compared with persons who remained cogni-
tively normal.28 In a small study of participants with MCI,29 a
low initial BMI and weight loss during follow-up were associ-
ated with a significantly greater risk of developing dementia.
In a population-based cohort, a higher midlife BMI was re-
lated to a higher risk of dementia and Alzheimer dementia, in-
dependent of obesity-related risk factors and comorbidities.30
In an elderly African American cohort, participants who de-
veloped MCI had a greater rate of weight loss (revealed by
repeated BMI measurements) compared with elderly partici-
pants who remained cognitively normal.16 Similarly, in a case-
control study in Olmsted County, weight loss was associated
with a greater risk of dementia in women but not in men.31 In
the prospective Honolulu Aging Study, weight loss preceded
onset of dementia in a cohort of men who were followed up
for 26 years.7,27,31
Contrary to our findings, a higher BMI in both midlife and
late life was associated with decreased risk of dementia in a
large population-based retrospective study.13 Potential is-

The estimates are based on a model adjusted for sex, years of education,
APOE*E4, and weight at study entry, with age as the time scale. The mean (SD)
maximum weight measurements in midlife were 62.0 (5.1) kg for the first
quartile (Q1), 75.9 (3.6) kg for the second quartile (Q2), 86.8 (2.9) kg for the
third quartile (Q3), and 103.7 (11.8) kg for the fourth quartile (Q4). The observed
median (fifth and 95th percentile) rates of weight change from midlife to study
entry for the 4 weight quartiles were −0.4 (−6.5 to 5.2) kg per decade for Q1,
−1.0 (−8.2 to 5.2) kg per decade for Q2, −1.7 (−9.4 to 6.0) kg per decade for Q3,
and −2.3 (−14.4 to 7.7) kg per decade for Q4. We provided the fifth and 95th
percentiles to give a broader sense of the distribution of weight change for each
midlife weight quartile.

if there is a mix of timings of age at assessment of weight and
BMI, with the majority of people being assessed at older ages.
In another large population-based prospective study,32 being
overweight or obese in midlife was not associated with in-
creased risk of dementia.
Weight loss prior to MCI or dementia may be a component
ofthepredementiasyndrome.Ifweightlossisaprodromalstage
of dementia, we would expect the association between weight
lossandMCItobesimilaracrossmidlifeweightclasses.Indeed,
the associations between weight loss and MCI did not differ
across midlife weight quartiles, suggesting that the hypothesis
of weight loss as a prodromal predementia stage is likely.
The association of weight loss with cognitive impairment
may involve direct causal mechanisms or may be due to re-
versecausalityorasharedetiology.Withregardtocausalmecha-
nisms, weight loss prior to cognitive impairment may be re-
latedtowhathasbeentermedanorexiaofaging.Whilethedirect
cause of this anorexia is not clear, we speculate that the dys-
functional production of certain hormones (cholecystokinin,
leptin, cytokines, dynorphin, neuropeptide Y, and serotonin)
on dietary intakes and energy metabolism may lead to re-
duced dietary intakes that affect MCI risk. With regard to re-
verse causality, neuropsychiatric symptoms such as depres-
sionandapathy,whichareprodromalandpredictorsofMCIand
dementia,maycontributetodecreasedappetiteandweightloss
prior to the diagnosis of these conditions.33-35 Finally, with re-
gard to a shared etiology, protein deposits including Lewy bod-
ies, tau, or amyloid have been identified in the olfactory bulb
and central olfactory pathways prior to the onset of dementia,
and olfactory dysfunction is a marker for cognitive impair-
ment and dementia.36-40 Thus, impairment in smell with re-
latedchangesintastemaycontributetodecreasedappetite,re-
duced dietary intake, and the weight loss observed with MCI,
Alzheimer dementia, and other neurodegenerative conditions.
The association of high midlife weight with MCI may in-
volve effects of obesity on the brain through cerebrovascular
disease and metabolic abnormalities (eg, glucose metabolism
and insulin signaling).41 Obesity-related brain pathology likely
includes hypoperfusion,42 neuronal injury and death,42 brain
atrophy,43 cerebrovascular dysfunction,42 increased levels of
β-amyloid precursor protein,44 increased tau expression,45
blood-brain barrier dysfunction,46 systemic47,48 and central49
inflammation-related pathologies, and dysfunction of microg-
lia and astrocytes.50,51
A potential limitation of our study is that it was not pos-
sible to determine whether weight loss was intentional or un-
intentional. Given the consistency of the association of weight
loss with incident MCI across all midlife weight quartiles, it is
most likely unintentional weight loss. Despite the limited eth-
nic diversity of the study cohort, our findings are consistent
with the findings from an African American cohort.16
Additional strengths of our study include the large co-
hort and population-based design. Participants were clini-
cally assessed for risk of MCI or dementia. Furthermore, in-
formation on clinical conditions was abstracted from the
medical record rather than from self-report.
Conclusions
In summary, our findings suggest that an increasing rate of
weight loss from midlife to late life is a marker for MCI and may
help identify persons at increased risk of MCI.
