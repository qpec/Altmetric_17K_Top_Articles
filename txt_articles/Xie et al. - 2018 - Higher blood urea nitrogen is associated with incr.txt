Experimental evidence suggests that higher levels of urea
may increase insulin resistance and suppress insulin
secretion. However, whether higher levels of blood urea
nitrogen (BUN) are associated with increased risk of
incident diabetes mellitus in humans is not known. To
study this, we built a national cohort of 1,337,452 United
States Veterans without diabetes to characterize the
association of BUN and risk of incident diabetes. Over a
median follow-up of 4.93 years, there were 172,913 cases of
incident diabetes. In joint risk models of estimated
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and BUN. there was no
association between eGFR and the risk of incident diabetes
in those with a BUN of 25 mg/dl or less. However, the risk
was significantly increased in those with a BUN over 25 mg/
dl at all eGFR levels, even in those with an eGFR of 60 ml/
min/1.73m2 or more (hazard ratio 1.27; confidence interval
1.24-1.31). The risk of incident diabetes was highest in
those with BUN over 25 mg/dL and an eGFR under 15 ml/
min/1.73m2 (1.68; 1.51-1.87). Spline analyses of the
relationship between BUN and risk of incident diabetes
showed that risk was progressively higher as BUN
increased. In models where eGFR was included as a
continuous covariate, compared to a BUN of 25 mg/dl or
less, a BUN over 25 mg/dl was associated with increased
risk of incident diabetes (1.23; 1.21-1.25). Every 10 ml/min/
1.73m2 decrease in eGFR was not associated with risk of
incident diabetes (1.00; 1.00-1.01). Two-stage residual
inclusion analyses showed that, independent of the impact
of eGFR, every 10 mg/dL increase in BUN concentration was
associated with increased risk of incident diabetes (1.15;
1.14-1.16). Thus, higher levels of BUN are associated with
increased risk of incident diabetes mellitus.

C
hronic kidney disease (CKD) is characterized by dis-
turbances in glucose and insulin homeostasis.1 In a
cohort of 4680 participants without diabetes mellitus
in the Cardiovascular Health Study, Pham et al.2 reported
that a decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)
is associated with increased insulin resistance; however, over
a median follow-up of 12 years, participants with a
decreased eGFR did not have an increased risk of incident
diabetes mellitus. It was noted that the majority of cohort
participants had mild CKD, and the number of participants
with an eGFR <45 ml/min per 1.73 m2 was small
(N ¼ 282), which may not have allowed a more nuanced
characterization of the risk of diabetes mellitus in those with
a very low eGFR. In an elegant subsequent study of 59
participants with nondiabetic CKD (mean eGFR, 37.6
ml/min per 1.73 m2) and 39 healthy controls, de Boer et al.
reported that those with CKD had lower insulin sensitivity,
reduced insulin clearance, and inadequate augmentation of
insulin secretion.3,4 The investigators suggested that the
combination of insulin resistance and an inability to
adequately augment insulin secretion led to the observation
of a higher prevalence of glucose intolerance in moderate to
severe CKD.
Experimental evidence identifies urea as a putative culprit
of reduced insulin sensitivity and defective insulin secre-
tion.5,6 Studies by D’Apolito et al.5 suggest that cultured
adipocytes treated with urea (at disease-relevant concentra-
tions) exhibited decreased insulin sensitivity. In a mouse
model of surgically induced kidney failure, uremic mice
displayed insulin resistance and glucose intolerance, and urea
infusion produced the same degree of insulin resistance in
normal mice.5 Recent seminal observations by Koppe et al.6
and Thomas et al.7 suggest that defective insulin secretion
in CKD is mechanistically caused by elevated levels of circu-
lating urea, a condition that becomes manifest in advanced
stages of CKD.
The disturbances of glucose and insulin homeostasis in
CKD are complex and represent 2 opposing forces at play.

 On the one hand, CKD decreases insulin sensitivity (and
increases insulin resistance) and, in advanced stages, results
in beta-cell dysfunction and defective insulin secretion.8 On
the other hand, CKD leads to decreased insulin clearance,
thus prolonging its half-life.1,9 The balance of these 2
opposing forces shapes the state of glucose metabolism and
ultimately the risk of diabetes mellitus in any individual
patient. We hypothesized that as CKD progresses and blood
urea
nitrogen
(BUN)
increases,
both
reduced
insulin
sensitivity and defective insulin secretion become more
pronounced and result in a state of clinically evident
diabetes mellitus and that, congruent with the experimental
evidence of urea suppressing insulin sensitivity and insulin
secretion, higher levels of BUN are associated with an
increased risk of incident diabetes mellitus. Taking a big data
approach, we used the US Department of Veterans Affairs
(VA) databases to build a national cohort of 1,337,452 US
veterans without diabetes mellitus and followed them over
time to characterize the association of BUN and the risk of
incident diabetes mellitus.
RESULTS
There were 1,337,452 cohort participants followed for a
median of 4.93 years (interquartile range, 4.93–4.93). Table 1
details the demographic and health characteristics of the
overall cohort by BUN category (#25 and >25 mg/dl) at time
of cohort entry (T0). Supplementary Table S1 describes
baseline characteristics by eGFR category. Overall, cohort
participants were mostly of white race and male sex (Table 1).
Cohort participants had an average first eGFR and first BUN
level of 75.55 � 19.94 ml/min per 1.72 m2 and 16.78 � 7.04
mg/dl, respectively (Table 1). There were 172,913 (12.93%)
incident cases of diabetes in the overall cohort. In inverse
probability weighting analyses (which account for the uneven
probability of experiencing competing risk in BUN cate-
gories) (weighted N ¼ 1,340,998), there were 210,873
(15.73%) cases of incident diabetes: 23,649 (19.85%) in those
with a BUN level >25 mg/dl and 187,224 (15.32%) in those
with a BUN level #25 mg/dl (Table 1). The 5-year diabetes-
free survival probability by time-updated eGFR category and
time-updated BUN category are presented in Figures 1 and 2,
respectively.
Association between time-updated eGFR and the risk of
incident diabetes mellitus
In Cox survival models adjusted for age, race, sex, and time-
varying variables including body mass index (BMI), serum
carbon

albuminuria,
frequency
of
outpatient
encounters,
frequency
of
hospitalizations,
and
relevant
comorbidities and health characteristics, compared with those
with an eGFR $60 ml/min per 1.73 m2, there was a gradual
increase in the risk of incident diabetes mellitus with a
decreasing eGFR (Table 2). Risk was pronounced in those
with an eGFR <30 and $15 ml/min per 1.73 m2 and those
with an eGFR <15 ml/min per 1.73 m2 with a hazard ratio
(HR) of 1.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.12–1.22, and an
HR of 1.64, 95% CI 1.48–1.82, respectively (Table 2). Spline
analysis of the relationship between the eGFR and the risk of
incident diabetes mellitus suggested an exponential relation-
ship in which risk progressively increased as eGFR decreased
(Figure 3).
Association between time-updated BUN and the risk of
incident diabetes mellitus
Using a big data approach, we tested the question of
whether elevated levels of urea are associated with an
increased risk of incident diabetes mellitus. In a joint risk
model (of eGFR and BUN), we examined the risk of inci-
dent diabetes by BUN and eGFR category (Table 3). In
cohort participants with low BUN (#25 mg/dl), there was
no significant relationship between the eGFR and the risk
of incident diabetes in any eGFR category. In cohort par-
ticipants with BUN >25 mg/dl, the risk of incident diabetes
was significantly increased at all eGFR levels, even in those
with an eGFR $60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (HR, 1.27; 95% CI
1.24–1.31) (Table 3). The risk of incident diabetes was
highest in those with BUN >25 mg/dl and an eGFR <15
ml/min per 1.73 m2 (HR, 1.68; 95% CI 1.51–1.87)
(Table 3). A joint risk model with BUN categorized in
quintiles
yielded
consistent
findings
(Supplementary
Table S2). A spline analysis of the relationship between
BUN and the risk of incident diabetes showed that the risk
of incident diabetes was progressively higher as BUN
increased (Figure 4).
In models in which eGFR was included as a continuous
covariate, compared with BUN #25 mg/dl, BUN >25 mg/dl
was associated with an increased risk of incident diabetes
mellitus (HR, 1.23; 95% CI 1.21–1.25). In the same model,
every 10-ml/min per 1.73 m2 increase in the eGFR was not
associated with the risk of incident diabetes mellitus (HR,
1.00; 95% CI 1.00–1.01). Spline analysis, which included
both the eGFR and BUN, showed that although the risk of
incident diabetes mellitus increased with increased BUN
concentrations, the risk was decreased with decreased eGFR
(Figure 5). Because the eGFR and BUN are inherently
correlated, we applied a 2-stage residual inclusion method to
account for this correlation and evaluate the independent
impact of BUN on the risk of incident diabetes.10 Results
showed that, after accounting for the effect of eGFR and its
correlation
with
BUN,
every
10
mg/dl
increase
in
BUN concentration was associated with a significant increase
in the risk of incident diabetes mellitus (HR, 1.15; 95%
CI 1.14–1.16). However, independent of the impact of BUN,
every 10 ml/min per 1.73 m2 increase of eGFR yielded no
significant change in the risk of diabetes mellitus (HR, 1.01;
95% CI 1.01–1.01).
Formal interaction analyses were undertaken and showed
that increasing age attenuated the association of BUN and the
risk of incident diabetes (P value for interaction <0.001).
BUN >25 mg/dl was more strongly associated with an
increased risk of diabetes among cohort participants who were
younger than the median age of the overall cohort (65.1 years

 of age) (HR, 1.35; 95% CI 1.33–1.37) than those who were
older than 65.1 years of age (HR, 1.20; 95% CI 1.16–1.24).
Race also modified the association of BUN and the risk of
incident diabetes mellitus (P value for interaction <0.001);
BUN >25 mg/dl was more strongly associated with an
increased risk of diabetes among blacks (HR, 1.38; 95% CI

1.38) than whites (HR, 1.21; 95% CI 1.20–1.22).
Association between baseline (T0) BUN and the risk of
incident diabetes
We repeated the primary analyses in models in which we
considered baseline BUN (at T0) as the primary predictor.
However, individuals with a high BUN level have a signifi-
cantly increased risk of ESRD and early death and thus have a
much higher probability of experiencing a competing risk
than cohort participants with a BUN level #25 mg/dl. We
therefore used an inverse probability weighting approach to
address this bias. The 5-year diabetes-free survival probability
by BUN at T0 is depicted in Figure 6. In a joint risk model (of
eGFR and BUN), the risk of incident diabetes was signifi-
cantly increased at all eGFR levels in those with a BUN level
>25 mg/dl (Table 4). A spline analysis of the relationship
between BUN level and the risk of incident diabetes showed
that the risk of incident diabetes was progressively higher as
BUN increased (Figure 7). In models in which eGFR was
included as a continuous covariate, compared with a BUN
level #25 mg/dl, a BUN level >25 mg/dl was associated with
an increased risk of incident diabetes mellitus (HR, 1.18; 95%
CI 1.15–1.20). In the same model, every 10 ml/min per 1.73
m2 increase in eGFR was not associated with the risk of
incident diabetes mellitus (HR, 1.00; 95% CI 0.99–1.00). In
2-step residual inclusion models, every 10-mg/dl increase in
BUN concentration was associated with a significant increase
in the risk of incident diabetes mellitus (HR, 1.09; 95% CI
1.08–1.10), whereas every 10 ml/min per 1.73 m2 increase in
eGFR yielded no significant change in the risk of diabetes

excluded cohort participants who experienced kidney trans-
plantation, dialysis, or death during follow-up yielded
consistent results.
Sensitivity analyses
In order to test the robustness of our study results to changes
in epidemiologic design and statistical specifications, we
performed the following sensitivity analyses. All sensitivity
analyses were undertaken using time-updated models. We
considered, in a joint risk model, the association between
BMI and eGFR category and the risk of incident diabetes. The
results suggest that in those who were underweight, of normal
weight, or overweight, as the eGFR decreased, the risk of
incident
diabetes
increased
significantly
(Supplementary
Table S3, Supplementary Figure S1). In cohort participants
with obesity (BMI $30 kg/m2), the risk of diabetes was
uniformly elevated in all eGFR categories. We then considered
the joint association of BMI and BUN level (categorized as
>25 or #25 mg/dl and separately in quintiles) with the risk of
incident diabetes. As the BUN level increased, the risk of
incident diabetes increased in the following BMI categories:
underweight, normal, and overweight. The risk was uni-
formly increased in those with obesity (BMI $30 kg/m2)
(Supplementary
Tables
S4
and
S5
and
Supplementary
Figures S2 and S3). Because gastrointestinal bleeding may
lead to an increased BUN level, we repeated the analyses in
which we considered gastrointestinal conditions associated
with bleeding as covariates; the results were consistent
(Supplementary Table S6). Exposure to corticosteroids may
also elevate BUN levels and increases the risk of diabetes
mellitus. Including exposure to corticosteroids as a covariate

 in the models yielded results consistent with those shown in
the primary analyses (Supplementary Table S7). We repeated
the analyses using the MDRD (Modification of Diet in Renal
Disease) study equation to compute the eGFR, and the results
were consistent (Supplementary Table S8). Because the
presence of albuminuria may in some instances triggers the
discovery of underlying diabetes (where it was long present
but undiagnosed), we repeated the analyses excluding all
participants with albuminuria during follow-up; the results
were consistent with those shown in primary analyses
(Supplementary Table S9). Because the existence of albu-
minuria at cohort entry (T0) may be caused by existing
diabetes that has not yet been diagnosed and documented, we
repeated the entire cohort building process in which we
excluded those with any albuminuria within 5 years before T0
from cohort entry; the analyses yielded findings consistent
with the primary results (Supplementary Table S10). Because
the diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy in a newly diagnosed
individual with diabetes likely suggests that diabetes was
present (but undiagnosed for a prolonged period of time), we
also considered analyses in which we excluded participants
with diabetic retinopathy during follow-up, and the results
were consistent (Supplementary Table S11). Analyses in
which we excluded secondary diabetes during follow-up also
yielded consistent results (Supplementary Table S12). Because
the frequency of eGFR and BUN measurements may bias the
results, we conducted analyses in which we additionally
controlled for the number of eGFR and BUN measurements,
and the results were consistent (Supplementary Table S13).
Because baseline HbA1c may influence the future risk of
diabetes and may potentially confound a putative indepen-
dent relationship between the BUN level and the risk of
diabetes, we controlled for baseline HbA1c in a subcohort of

 and an increased risk of diabetes defined by diagnostic codes,
use of diabetic medications, or HbA1c >6.4 (HR, 1.24; 95%
CI 1.21–1.27).
Because the frequency of HbA1c testing may bias the
results, we (i) used the overall cohort and included the time-
updated number of HbA1C measurements as a covariate; a
BUN level >25 mg/dl was associated with an increased risk of
diabetes (HR, 1.22; 95% CI 1.20-1.24); and (ii) restricted the
analyses to a subcohort of those with at least 1 HbA1c mea-
surement (N ¼ 677,234) while also controlling for the
number of HbA1C measurements; a BUN level >25 mg/dl
was associated with an increased risk of diabetes (HR, 1.22;
95% CI 1.20–1.25).
We examined the relationship between BUN and the risk
of each component of the composite outcome separately;
BUN level>25 mg/dl was associated with an increased risk of
diabetes defined by diagnostic codes (HR, 1.18; 95% CI 1.16–
1.21), use of diabetic medications (HR, 1.13; 95% CI 1.09–
1.17), and HbA1c >6.4 (HR, 1.25; 95% CI 1.22–1.28).
Finally, we considered eGFR and BUN on the log10 scale;
a per-unit increase in log10 eGFR was associated with a
decreased risk of incident diabetes (HR, 0.80; 95% CI 0.77–
0.83) (Supplementary Figure S4); a per-unit increase in log10
BUN level was associated with an increased risk of incident
diabetes (HR, 1.56; 95% CI 1.51–1.61) (Supplementary
Figure S5). Spline analyses in which both log10 eGFR and
log10 BUN level were included suggested that whereas the
risk of incident diabetes mellitus increased with increased
BUN
concentrations,
the
risk
was
decreased
with
a
decreased eGFR (Supplementary Figure S6).
DISCUSSION
Using a big data approach, we examined the association
between BUN and the risk of incident diabetes in a cohort
of 1,337,452 US veterans followed for a median of 4.93 years
(5,609,802.38 person-years). Our findings show that as the
eGFR decreased and the BUN level increased, the risk of
incident diabetes became progressively more pronounced.
Results from joint risk models of eGFR and BUN (in which
BUN was considered as >25 mg/dl and #25 mg/dl and
separately in quintiles), spline analyses, which allow for the
examination of the association of BUN and risk of incident
diabetes in a nonlinear form while considering BUN as a
continuous variable,11 analyses that included both eGFR and
BUN concurrently and 2-step residual inclusion models
(which allow examination of the impact of BUN indepen-
dent of its correlation with the eGFR) support the conclu-
sion that a higher concentration of BUN is associated with
an increased risk of incident diabetes mellitus. The results
were robust to challenges in multiple sensitivity analyses.
The kidney is an important organ in glucose homeosta-
sis,7,12 which relies on the adequate production of insulin
from pancreatic beta cells and adequate action of insulin in
peripheral tissues.6 Both production of insulin and tissue
sensitivity to insulin are impaired in the setting of CKD.1,13,14
The mechanisms underlying the disturbances of glucose
homeostasis are becoming clearer and likely involve retention
of uremic metabolites including urea, and p-cresyl sulfates,
modification
of
gut
microbiome,
oxidative
stress,
and
inflammation. Other conditions including metabolic acidosis,
aging, and excess angiotensin II may result in insulin resis-
tance.1,8,14 Earlier observations by Pham et al.2 and de Boer
et al4 clearly demonstrated that kidney disease results in a
state of increased insulin resistance (and reduced insulin
sensitivity). In an elegant body of work, Koppe et al.13
demonstrated that retention of renally excreted compounds
including p-cresyl sulfate mechanistically contributes to the
genesis of the state of insulin resistance in the setting of
kidney disease. D’Apolito et al.5 reported that urea caused
increased reactive oxygen species production, increased
insulin resistance, and glucose intolerance in uremic mice and
that treatment with a superoxide dismutase/catalase mimetic
normalized these defects. This treatment also abrogated the
development of insulin resistance in normal mice following
infusion of urea.5 In recent seminal observations, Koppe
et al.6 further demonstrated that beta-cell dysfunction is an
important contributor to deranged glucose homeostasis in
experimental CKD and that kidney disease is associated with
defective insulin secretion and that insulin secretory defects in
CKD are mechanistically linked to elevated levels of the major
uremic metabolite urea. A few small studies reported a rela-
tionship between low eGFR and elevated levels of cystatin C
and the odds of diabetes mellitus.15,16
Our results provide epidemiologic evidence to support
those mechanistic studies by D’Apolito et al.5 and Koppe
et al.6 in that we found that risk of diabetes is increased in
those with a higher BUN level (>25 mg/dl) regardless of
eGFR levels (and that the relationship between the eGFR and
the risk of diabetes was nonsignificant in those with a BUN
level #25 mg/dl); the risk relationship (between the BUN
level and the risk of diabetes) appears exponential in nature in
that risk progressively increased with increased BUN levels.

747
 Furthermore, our 2-stage residual inclusion analyses (which
account for the intimate correlation between eGFR and BUN)
suggest that the significant increase in the risk of diabetes as
the eGFR decreased is most likely due to its correlation with
the BUN level. Spline analyses that included both the eGFR
and BUN level showed that the risk of diabetes was increased
with an increased BUN level and the risk was decreased with a
decreased eGFR; therefore, endorsing the finding that the risk
of diabetes seen with a low eGFR is most likely accounted for
by a high BUN level in that context. Taken together, the
constellation of findings suggests that in advanced kidney
disease and consistent with the experimental evidence, an
elevated BUN level is associated with an increased risk of
incident diabetes mellitus.
Although increased insulin resistance in CKD is now a
universally recognized concept, the notion of beta-cell
dysfunction (and possibly an insulin secretory defect) in
CKD is still not yet widely accepted.1,6,13,17 That our study
results are congruent with the experimental observations of
Koppe et al.1,6 and D’Apolito et al.5 lends validity and
provides epidemiologic evidence in humans of an associ-
ation between circulating levels of urea and the risk of the
development of diabetes in patients with nondiabetic kid-
ney disease. However, our studies cannot attribute the
effect seen to decreased insulin secretion (and beta-cell
dysfunction) or increased insulin resistance or a combi-
nation of both. Further studies are required to validate
these findings in other cohorts and to examine whether
interventions
(by
pharmacologic
means,
microbiome
manipulation, or other methods) to reduce urea or its
downstream effects will result in a decreased risk of
diabetes mellitus.
Because obesity is an important driver of both kidney
disease and diabetes, we evaluated the risk of diabetes in joint
risk models of eGFR and BMI and separately of BUN and
BMI, the results show that as kidney function deteriorates, the
risk of diabetes increases in all BMI categories except for those
with obesity, most likely owing to the profoundly increased
risk of diabetes in that setting, which may have dwarfed a
relatively less strong risk factor (decreased eGFR and elevated
BUN level).18,19
Although experimental evidence identifies urea as a
putative culprit and although our epidemiologic human
observations suggest an association between the BUN level
and the risk of diabetes, it is important to note that our
studies focused on urea; however, in the setting of CKD, a
significant number of metabolites including indoxyl sulfate,
p-cresyl
sulfate,
and
numerous
others
are
increased,
and they may either have contributed to or were responsible
for
the
association
described
in
this
report.20
The
furan fatty acid metabolite 3-carboxy-4-methyl-5-propyl-2-
furanpropanoic acid, at concentrations found in CKD
patients, also impairs insulin secretion via a mechanism
involving mitochondrial dysfunction and abrogation of
insulin biosynthesis in beta cells.21 Furthermore, metabolic
derangements associated with CKD including metabolic
acidosis, dyslipidemia, hyperuricemia, hypovitaminosis D,
disordered bone and mineral metabolism, and, in particular,
secondary hyperparathyroidism may result in beta-cell
dysregulation.1,6,21–26
Our study has a number of limitations. The analytic cohort
included mostly older white male US veterans, which may
limit the generalizability of study results. Although we
accounted for known confounders, we cannot exclude the
possibility of residual confounders (either unmeasured or
unknown). de Boer et al.4 described reduced insulin sensi-
tivity and clearance that are, in part, explained by differences
in lifestyle and body composition; our databases did not
include information on these parameters. A low-protein diet
ameliorates insulin sensitivity27; although we included serum
bicarbonate, a surrogate marker of protein intake, as a
covariate in the models, our datasets did not include infor-
mation on dietary intake. Because declining kidney function
may lead to increased health care use, it is likely that this
increased intensity of care may have resulted in the identifi-
cation of diabetes and hence explains the risk seen in this
report (Berksonian bias).28,29 We have, however, taken care to
include measures of health care use and intensity of care as
covariates in the models. In addition, we have considered
analyses in which we excluded participants in whom albu-
minuria developed before cohort entry (as it might be caused
by diabetes that has not been yet diagnosed) or during the
time in cohort (as it is likely to trigger the discovery of
otherwise occult diabetes) and diabetic retinopathy (which is
likely indicates that diabetes was present for a long time but
was not diagnosed) during the time in the cohort, and the
results remained robust. In addition, given the correlated
relationship between eGFR and BUN level, we developed
analytic strategies to disentangle the effects of eGFR and BUN
for which we built joint risk models and used 2-step residual
estimation methods to evaluate the independent impact of
BUN on the risk of incident diabetes.10 The study has a
number of strengths including the use of national large-scale
data from a network of integrated health systems that were
captured during routine medical care, which minimizes
selection bias. In sum, our results show an association
between higher levels of BUN and the risk of incident diabetes
mellitus. A nexus (and, more specifically, a bidirectional
relationship) likely exists between diabetes mellitus and
kidney disease in that diabetes is (indisputably) a driver of
kidney disease, and emerging evidence suggests that urea (and
possibly other uremic components) may increase the risk of
diabetes. Future research should examine whether higher
levels of urea are associated with poorer diabetes control and
poorer outcomes among diabetic patients and whether
elevated levels of urea are associated with an increased risk of
failure of oral hypoglycemic agents and increased need for
insulin.

 MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cohort participants
Using the US Department of Veterans Affairs administrative data-
base, we selected 4,605,535 participants enrolled in the VA Health
Care System before October 1, 2003. We then excluded those without
an outpatient serum creatinine measurement between October 1,
2007 and October 1, 2008 (2,199,385 participants); for those with a
measurement in this period, we designated the date of last eGFR
measurement as T0. We then additionally excluded those with dia-
betes mellitus before T0 (906,523 participants) (where washout
period spanned at least 5 years [October 1, 2003–October 1, 2008] or
longer for those enrolled in the US Department of Veterans Affairs
health care system before October 1, 2003), yielding an intermediate
cohort of 1,499,627 participants. We further removed those with
missing data on weight, height, BUN level, and serum carbon di-
oxide before T0 (157,140 participants) and those who underwent
dialysis or kidney transplantation before T0 (5035 participants),
yielding the final analytic cohort of 1,337,452 participants (Figure 8).
The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the VA
St. Louis Health Care System, St. Louis, MO.
Data sources
Veterans Health Administration Medical SAS Inpatient and Outpa-
tient Datasets that contain national Veterans Health Administration
health care encounters data were used to collect information on

on height and weight to compute BMI. The VA Beneficiary Identi-
fication Records Locator Subsystem files, Medical SAS, and Vital
Status datasets provided demographic characteristics.30 Information
about occurrence of dialysis and kidney transplantation was obtained
from the United States Renal Database System.34
Primary predictor variables
The primary predictor variables were time-varying outpatient eGFR
and outpatient BUN level. Because the eGFR and BUN level were not
measured at every time point, the values were imputed by the
measurements before and closest to the time point when no mea-
surements were taken. The eGFR and BUN level measurements were
carried forward 154.89 days (interquartile range, 102.65–252.68) and
150.24 days (interquartile range, 100.57–231.78), respectively. The
eGFR was computed based on the Chronic Kidney Disease Epide-
miology Collaboration equation and was classified into 5 categories:
eGFR $60 ml/min per 1.73 m2, 60 > eGFR $ 45 ml/min per 1.73
m2, 45 > eGFR $ 30 ml/min per 1.73 m2, 30 > eGFR $ 15 ml/min
per 1.73 m2, and, eGFR<15 ml/min per 1.73 m2 with no kidney
transplant or dialysis. BUN levels were classified as high (BUN >25
mg/dl) and low (BUN #25 mg/dl) categories and as quintiles based
on the ranking at each time point.
Outcome
The outcome of this study was incident diabetes mellitus. Diabetes
mellitus was defined as any occurrence of the following: Interna-
tional Classification of Diseases 9 codes 250.X, 357.2, 362.0, and
366.41; diabetes medication prescription (including insulins and oral
hypoglycemic agents); or an HbA1c test result >6.4%.35

 Covariates
Covariate curation was informed by previous evidence.28,29,36–38
Covariates were measured from 5 years before T0 until the end of
follow-up. Comorbidities included cardiovascular disease, peripheral
artery
disease,
cerebrovascular
disease,
chronic
lung
disease,
dementia, cancer, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hepatitis C, and
HIV. All comorbidities were assigned based on relevant International
Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification
diagnostic codes except for hepatitis C and HIV, which were assigned
based on laboratory results.28,29,36–40 Comorbidities were time
varying and considered to exist until the end of follow-up once
diagnosed. BMI was categorized into underweight (BMI <18.5 kg/
m2), normal (18.5 kg/m2 # BMI <25 kg/m2), overweight (25 kg/
m2 # BMI <30 kg/m2), and obese (30 kg/m2 # BMI). Albuminuria
status was a dichotomous variable for which a microalbumin/
creatinine ratio >30 mg/g was considered albuminuria. Serum
carbon dioxide
was treated as a continuous variable.
BMI,
albuminuria, and serum carbon dioxide at time t were considered to
have the same value as the measurement at or before and closest to
time t. The number of hospitalizations and outpatient encounters
were accumulated from 5 years before T0 and grouped into 4 groups
based on ranking at each time point. Based on the number, fre-
quency of hospitalizations was then classified into never hospitalized
or split into tertiles (low, medium, and high), whereas frequency of
outpatient encounters was grouped into quartiles. Information about
medications that increase the risk of diabetes mellitus (including
corticosteroids, tacrolimus, cyclosporine, pentamidine, nicotinic
acid, and some antiretrovirals) were used to create a 4-level
time-varying variable at time t, where users were categorized as
never use when there was no record of medication use between
October 1, 2003 and time t, past use when the last record of
medication was between October 1, 2003 and time t; current
use <90 days when the last record of medication is at time t but does
not extend 90 days before time t; and current use 90 days or greater
when the prescription is current at time t and extends $90 days
before time t. Besides time-varying variables, time-independent
variables including age; race defined as white, black and other; and
sex were also included in multivariate analyses as covariates.
Participants with missing baseline covariates were excluded from
study entry. A value carry forward approach was applied to the data
missing during follow-up.
Statistical analyses
Means and SDs, counts and percentages, and medians and inter-
quartile ranges were used to describe cohort characteristics at T0.
The Simon and Makuch method for diabetes-free survival curves,
which evaluates a participant’s exposure status at each event time and
takes into account the change in exposure status over time, was used
for time-dependent eGFR categories and BUN categories.41 Kaplan-
Meier curves were used to depict diabetes-free survival probability by
baseline BUN categories.
Assuming a nearly contemporaneous relationship between
exposure and outcome, time-varying multivariate Cox survival
models, which included a time-varying primary predictor and
covariates,
were
used
to
examine
the
relationship
between
the predictor and risk of incident diabetes mellitus. Because
time-varying analyses with large datasets are computationally
demanding, the time unit of analyses was set at 10 days. Multiple
approaches were applied to evaluate the relationship between BUN
level and diabetes mellitus while accounting for eGFR: we built
joint risk models in which the predictor was categorized based on
BUN and eGFR categories; we controlled for eGFR as a continuous
variable in order to account for possible reverse causation; we
applied a 2-stage residual inclusion method to examine the effect
of BUN uncorrelated with eGFR.10 The residual inclusion method
involved 2 regressions. In the first stage, BUN level at each time
point was regressed on the log of eGFR to yield a residual. In the
second stage, the residuals, as time varying, were used in place of
BUN as the primary predictor in a Cox survival model while
controlling for covariates and the log of eGFR. All models
controlled for age, race, sex, chronic lung disease, peripheral artery
disease, cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, dementia,
hyperlipidemia, hepatitis C, HIV, cancer, BMI, serum carbon
dioxide, frequency of hospitalization, frequency of outpatient
encounters, albuminuria, and use of medications that increase the
risk of diabetes mellitus. Death and end-stage renal disease (ESRD)
during follow-up were considered competing risks; therefore, in all
analyses, we used competing risk models to estimate the cause-
specific hazards.42–45 Cubic spline regressions were used to
examine
the
nonlinear
relationship
between
the
predictor
and outcomes,46 where eGFR was restricted to between 5 and 120
ml/min per 1.73 m2 and the BUN level was restricted to between 5
and 100 mg/dl to avoid the influence of extreme values.
In addition, we also examined the association between baseline
exposure and outcome. This analytic strategy is guided by the
notion that exposure to higher levels of BUN must occur for a
sufficient duration of time to eventually result in reduced insulin
sensitivity and reduced insulin secretion and subsequently manifest
in clinically diagnosable diabetes (the outcome in this study). The
probability of experiencing competing risk (of ESRD and death)
was significantly higher among those with a high BUN level. We
therefore applied an inverse probability weighting approach to
resample a pseudo population from cohort.47,48 In detail, each
cohort participant’s probability of not experiencing competing risk
during follow-up given baseline variables was calculated from
logistic regression. Then those who did not experience competing
risk were weighted by the inverse of the probability to create the
pseudo population. Analyses were done within the pseudo popu-
lation to examine the association between baseline exposure (BUN
at T0) and outcome given baseline covariates in the situation that
no competing risk occurs. We also built analyses to examine the
association in a cohort where we excluded those with a competing
risk.
In analyses, a 95% CI that does not include 1.00 was considered
statistically significant. All analyses were performed using SAS
Enterprise Guide version 7.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
Sensitivity analyses
To evaluate the association between the predictor and risk of
diabetes mellitus in different settings, we conducted multiple
sensitivity analyses. (i) We built a joint risk model to evaluate the
effect of eGFR and BMI categories on developing diabetes. (ii) We
built a joint risk model to evaluate the association of BUN level
and BMI categories with diabetes. (iii) We additionally controlled
for gastrointestinal bleeding, which would affect BUN levels. (iv)
We additionally controlled for steroids, which may also affect BUN
levels and increase the risk of diabetes. In this analysis, we did not
control for other medications that increase the risk of diabetes
mellitus to avoid collinearity. (v) We repeated the analyses using
the MDRD (Modification of Diet in Renal Disease) Study equation
to calculate eGFR. (vi) We excluded participants with albuminuria
during the follow-up to modify the outcome definition as diabetes

 mellitus without albuminuria. (vii) We excluded those who expe-
rienced albuminuria within 5 years before T0 because such albu-
minuria may have been caused by existing diabetes that has not yet
been diagnosed and documented. (viii) We excluded participants
with diabetic retinopathy during follow-up. (ix) We excluded
participants diagnosed with secondary diabetes mellitus during
follow-up. (x) To account for the potential confounding related to
the frequency of eGFR and BUN measurements, we additionally
controlled for the number of eGFR and BUN measurements
during follow-up. (xi) We controlled for baseline HbA1c within
those with available baseline HbA1c data. (xii) To account for
potential bias introduced by the frequency of HbA1c measure-
ments, we controlled for the time-updated number of HbA1c
measurements and examined the association in those with at least
1 HbA1c measurement. (xiii) We examined the relationship
between BUN level and risk of each component of the composite
outcome separately. (xiv) We also considered analyses in which
eGFR and BUN were log10 transformed.
