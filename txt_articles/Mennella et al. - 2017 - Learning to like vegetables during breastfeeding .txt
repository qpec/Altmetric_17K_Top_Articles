ABSTRACT
Background: What lactating mothers eat flavors breast milk and, in
turn, modifies their infants’ acceptance of similarly flavored foods.
Objective: We sought to determine the effects of the timing and
duration of eating a variety of vegetables during breastfeeding on
the liking of vegetables in both members of the dyad.
Design: We conducted a randomized controlled study of 97 mother-
infant dyads. Lactating mothers drank vegetable, beet, celery, and
carrot juices for 1 mo beginning at 0.5, 1.5, or 2.5 mo postpartum or
for 3 mo beginning at 0.5 mo postpartum. The control group drank
equal volumes of water and avoided drinking the juices. Mothers
rated the tastes of the juices and self-reported dietary intakes at each
monthly visit (0.5–4.5 mo). After weaning, when 7.9 mo of age, in-
fants’ acceptance of plain, carrot-flavor (exposed flavor), and broccoli-
flavor (nonexposed flavor) cereals was assessed on separate days.
Results: The timing of exposure affected the acceptance of the carrot
flavor that did not generalize to the novel broccoli flavor. A relatively
brief experience (1 mo) with vegetable flavors in mothers’ milk, starting
at 0.5 mo postpartum, was sufficient to shift the hedonic tone, which
resulted in a faster rate of eating carrot-flavored cereal than that in infants
who were exposed during subsequent months or not at all. One month of
exposure had a greater effect than 3 mo of exposure or no exposure.
Regardless of when exposure occurred, infants were less likely to display
facial expressions of distaste initially when eating the carrot cereal. Over
time, mothers liked the tastes of carrot, beet, and celery juices more, but
no changes in dietary intake of vegetables were observed.
Conclusions: Early life may be an optimum time for both infants
and their mothers to learn to like the taste of healthy foods. More
research is needed to facilitate the liking and eating of these
foods by mothers, which will, in turn, increase the likelihood of
their feeding these foods to their children. This trial was regis-
tered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01667549.

INTRODUCTION
Diets that are insufficient in vegetables are one of the top
dietary risk factors that contribute to both the global burden of
disease and mortality (1, 2). Unfortunately, the current reality is
that 1 in 4 American toddlers do not consume even one vegetable
on a given day (3–5) and, instead, like their mothers and other
adults (6), are more likely to consume sweet- and salty-tasting
snacks and sweetened beverages (3, 4), all of which have de-
sirable sensory properties that are inborn (7). By 4 y of age, most
children have diets that include only a small portion of vege-
tables (w5% of calories), whereas .15% of calories come from
sweets (8–10). Not surprisingly, Healthy People 2020 includes
as one of its goals an increase in the variety and contribution
of vegetables in the diets of all Americans $2 y of age (11).
Similar recommendations will most likely be made for even
younger Americans (12).
How do we help children get off to a healthy start by making
vegetables a part of their diet? Infants’ chemosensory systems are
functioning early in life and are open to learning (13). Research
has shown that infants learn about the flavors of foods, including
vegetables, before their first taste of solid foods, via the trans-
mission of a variety of dietary volatiles from the mothers’ diet to
the infants’ first foods [i.e., amniotic fluid and breast milk (re-
viewed by Mennella (14)]. Breastfeeding confers a greater ac-
ceptance of these foods but only if they are part of the mother’s
diet (15–17) particularly during the first 4 mo of life (16). The
more varied the mother’s diet is during lactation, the more
varied the flavor of her milk will be (14), which could explain
why children who were breastfed are less picky and more
willing to try new foods as they grow (18).
One challenge in investigating how children learn to like
healthy foods such as vegetables is to determine whether there are
optimum times when an experience promotes greater liking (19).
A previous trial showed a greater liking of carrot-flavored cereal
by infants whose lactating mothers were randomly assigned,
during the first 3.5 postpartum months, to drink carrot juice,

 which flavored their breast milk (20), compared with avoiding
carrot juice and drinking water (16). Therefore, we aimed to
determine whether the timing and duration of the exposure to
vegetable flavors in breast milk were important in shifting the
hedonic tone of the taste of vegetables. Because babies breastfeed
more often during the first months of life (21), we hypothesized
that learning may be more effective earlier rather than later.
Because research in weaned infants has revealed that repeated
exposure to a variety of vegetable flavors increases the infants’
acceptance of the exposed as well as novel vegetables (22–25),
we provided mothers with different types of vegetable juices to
drink during the exposure period.
A second, related challenge in investigating how children learn
to like healthy foods is that the overall diet quality, particularly
vegetable intake, in women remains below current recommenda-
tions (9, 26, 27). Because mere exposure to the taste of a bitter-sweet
beverage can shift the liking of its taste in adults (28), we explored
whether manipulating the diets of lactating mothers and repeatedly
having them taste a variety of vegetable juices could also modify the
liking of the taste of vegetables for both members of the dyad.
METHODS
Participants and random assignment
Pregnant women or newly parturient women who intended to
exclusively breastfeed their infants .4 mo were recruited from
advertisement in local newspapers, websites, and Philadelphia
Women, Infants, and Children offices. Inclusion criteria included
a healthy, term, singleton birth, an establishment of lactation with
the intention to exclusively breastfeed for .4 mo, and no reported
allergies to fruit or vegetables. When infants were w2 wk of age,
the dyads came to the Human Sensory Testing Facility at the
Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,
whereupon they were randomly assigned into 1 of 5 groups who
differed in the timing and duration of when mothers drank veg-
etable juices during their infants’ first 4 mo postpartum. The
randomization scheme was generated by a statistician before any
subject enrollment, and the random assignment was stratified to
ensure a sex balance in the groups.
On the basis of our previous study that focused on the timing and
duration of a sensitive period during formula feeding whereby the
intake response within each group was normally distributed with
an SD of 96.0 (29), we determined that a target sample size of
10–12 subjects/group would provide 95% power to detect a
change at the 5% level. Study staff and mothers were not aware of
the hypotheses and were blinded to the group assignment or order
of testing. All procedures were followed in accordance with the
ethical standards of and approved by the Office of Regulatory
Affairs at the University of Pennsylvania. Informed consent was
obtained from each mother before inclusion. This trial was reg-
istered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01667549.
Trial design
As shown in Figure 1, when infants were 0.5 mo of age (61 wk),
dyads were randomly assigned into the following groups who
differed in the timing and duration of when lactating mothers
drank vegetable juices during their infants’ first 4 mo post-
partum as follows: exposure from 0.5 to 1.5 mo (1M0.5),
exposure from 1.5 to 2.5 mo (1M1.5), exposure from 2.5 to 3.5 mo
(1M2.5), exposure from 0.5 to 3.5 mo, or no exposure (control
group). Mothers in all groups were given 118-mL cups from
which to drink the juice (exposure group) or water (control
group). Women in the experimental groups were provided with
monthly supplies of the juices gratis at the beginning of the
exposure month (i.e., 0.5, 1.5, or 2.5 mo) or months (0.5–2.5 mo).
The women were instructed to drink a cupful (118 mL) of the
vegetable juices per occasion during their particular month or
months of exposure (resulting in 24 total exposures/mo; 8 carrot
juice exposures; and 8 vegetable juice exposures, 4 beet juice
exposures, and 4 celery juice exposures). The women were given
the following instructions. First, they could choose in which
order they drank the 4 juices, but once they began drinking one
type of juice, they were to finish that bottle before moving on to
the next; the number of exposures was based on the size of the
juice bottles provided. Second, they were to drink the juice w1–2 h
before breastfeeding to maximize the likelihood that the infants
were exposed to the flavors in breast milk. Previous research
established that a variety of volatiles, including those found
in carrot juice, transmit to human milk 1–3 h postingestion
(14, 20). Third, during the nonexposed months for the experi-
mental groups or during each month for the control group,
mothers were instructed to drink an equal volume of water and
to refrain from ingesting the exposure juices (or their solid
forms). Finally, the mothers recorded what time that they drank
the juices (or water) each day and when and how often they
breastfed their infants afterward, and telephone contact was

2.5 mo postpartum (1M1.5 group), from 2.5 to 3.5 mo postpartum (1M2.5
group), from 0.5 to 3.5 postpartum (3M0.5), or not at all (control group).
During the nonexposed months for the experimental groups or each month
for the control group, mothers drank an equal volume of water (gray boxes).
When infants were introduced to complementary foods (6–8 mo of age), they
were videotaped as they consumed, in counterbalanced order and on separate
days, cereal prepared with water, carrot juice (exposed flavor), or a broccoli
juice (novel flavor). 1M0.5, exposure from 0.5 to 1.5 mo; 1M1.5, exposure

from 0.5 to 3.5 mo.

 made weekly during the first 4 mo of the study to encourage, and
later to verify, compliance with study protocols and breast-
feeding exclusivity. Every month thereafter, telephone contact
was made monthly to determine when mothers began to com-
plement breastfeeding with solid foods.
At the first visit (0.5 mo), each month thereafter for the next
4 mo (at 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, and 4.5 mo), and for the vegetable acceptance
test visit (at 6–8 mo), dyads came to the Monell Center at the
same time of day that the mothers drank the juices during the
exposure period. At each visit, mothers and infants were weighed
and measured, and weight-for-height z scores for the infants were
calculated with the use of Anthro software (version 3.2.2; WHO),
and infants were observed breastfeeding from their mothers. At
the start of the study, mothers were asked about their motivations
to promote vegetable consumption (30) to establish levels of
motivations in the groups. No instructions were given regarding
when to wean the infants or what foods to feed them.
Food stimuli
For each month of maternal exposure, mothers consumed
118 mL of one type of the following juices on each of 24 d/mo as
follows: carrot juice (946 mL bottle; Lakewood Juices), beet juice
(500 mL bottle; Biotta Products), celery root juice (500 mL
bottle, Biotta Products), and vegetable juice (eight 163-mL cans;
V8 Campbell Soup Co.). These same juices, along with apple
juice (Ocean Spray), were used during the psychophysical testing
of the mothers. The food stimuli that were used for the vegetable
acceptance testing at weaning were plain rice cereal (84 g; Gerber
Products Co.) that was made with 16 g H2O or equal volumes of
carrot juice (exposed flavor) or broccoli juice (novel flavor).
Infants: vegetable acceptance tests
Several weeks after the mothers began complementing their
infants’ breast-milk diet with solid foods, dyads returned to the
Monell Center for 3 d and were videotaped as the mothers fed
their infants, in a counterbalanced and randomized order, plain,
carrot-flavored, or broccoli-flavored cereal. Testing, which oc-
curred in a private 108-sq ft testing room, was conducted under
naturalistic conditions in which infants determined the pacing and
duration of feeding (16). During feeding, mothers refrained from
talking or making faces to eliminate any potential influence on
their infants’ behaviors (31). To minimize possible effects that
were due to different levels of satiation, the testing sessions,
which lasted 2–3 h each, took place at the same time of day that
the mothers drank the juice or water during the exposure periods
and that the infants were usually fed (0010 to 1400). The infants,
who sat in a high chair (Flair Pedestal Highchair; Boon), were fed
until they refused the food on 5 consecutive occasions with the
criterion that the infant exhibited such behaviors as turning his or
her head away, pushing the spoon away, crying, or becoming
playful; the experimenter monitored the behaviors and signaled to
the mother when to stop feeding (15, 16). Immediately after each
feeding session, the mothers, who were unaware of the hypoth-
eses, rated, on a scale of 1 (extreme dislike) to 9 (extreme like),
their infants’ enjoyment of the food.
The infants’ behaviors were monitored via videotape. The
number of minutes that elapsed from the start to end of feeding
was the duration of the feed, and the amount consumed was
determined by weighing the bowl immediately before and after
each feed on a Mettler balance (model SG1600; Mettler-
Toledo). All food that was spilled onto the tray or bib during
the feed was placed in the bowl before weighing. Mothers were
never told how much their infants had ingested and were blind to
the hypotheses. Each videotape was subjected to a frame-by-
frame analysis to determine whether infants made a facial ex-
pression of distaste in response to the first 5 spoons offered. The
raters focused on brow movements (i.e., brow lowering and
inner brow raises), nose wrinkling, upper-lip raising, and
squinting because these facial expressions have been identified
as prototypical of distaste and are discriminating in gauging
infants’ like and dislike of tastes and flavors (15, 32). Intercoder
reliability was established by the common scoring of 198 feeds
[r(196 df) = 0.99, P , 0.0001], which indicated good reliability.
Mothers: psychophysical testing and diet records
At baseline (0.5 mo) and at the end of each of the first 4 monthly
visits, mothers rated their liking of the taste of the juices used
during the exposure (e.g., carrot, beet, celery root, and vegetable
juice) as well as of a sweet-tasting apple juice. After tasting each
juice, which were presented in a randomized order, for 5 s via a
swish-and-spit protocol (without swallowing), participants rated its
taste with the use of the general labeled magnitude scale (gLMS) to
measure taste intensities (e.g., bitterness and sweetness; scores
range from not detectable to strongest imaginable) and the hedonic
gLMS to measure ab affective experience in terms of the liking
(positive) and disliking (negative) on a computer with Compusense
5 Plus software (Compusense). Both measures are validated
psychophysical tools for taste research, and participants are trained
in their use before testing. In brief, participants score experiences
with the use of a vertical axis that is lined with adjectives that are
spaced semi-logarithmically on the basis of experimentally de-
termined intervals to produce ratio-quality data that can yield valid
group comparisons that cannot be made via other types of rating
(e.g., Likert) scales because the labels on the latter are not assumed
to be equal (33, 34). For the hedonic gLMS scale, scores range
from 295 to 95 with the anchors falling approximately as fol-
lows: strongest imaginable like = 95, very strong like = 50, strong
like = 33, moderate like = 16, weak like = 6, barely detectable
like = 1.4, neutral = 0, barely detectable dislike = 21.4, weak
dislike = 26, moderate dislike= 216, strong dislike = 233, very
strong dislike = 250, and strongest imaginable dislike = 295.
One minute separated the presentation of each stimulus during
which subjects rinsed their mouths with water.
Self-reported dietary intake data were recorded with the use of
the Automated Self-Administered 24-Hour Recall System that was
developed by the National Cancer Institute (35). During each study
visit, mothers reported a 24-h dietary recall to a trained researcher.
After a subject reported a specific food or beverage, the Automated
Self-Administered 24-Hour Recall System provided a visual de-
piction of the item in an appropriate dish, which allowed subjects
to accurately estimate portion sizes. Response sets with implau-
sible energy intake on the basis of estimated energy needs were
eliminated before analyses (36). From the data collected, we fo-
cused on daily caloric intake (kilocalories per day) and cup
equivalents of daily fruit and vegetable intakes, and we determined
whether the mother was meeting daily recommendations for fruit
(2 cups/d) and vegetables (2.5 cups/d) (37).

 Statistics
Primary outcome measures for the infants were total intake
(grams), the rate of feeding (grams per minute), and maternal
perceptions of the infants’ enjoyment after eating each of the
different flavored test foods (plain cereal, carrot-flavored cereal,
and broccoli-flavored cereal). To determine whether there were
main effects, we conducted a repeated-measures ANOVA with
test foods as the within-subject factor and the experimental
group as the grouping factor. Planned comparisons were carried
out to test our timing and duration hypotheses. First, we con-
ducted separate ANOVAs with a priori contrasts that were
specified to determine whether the 1-mo exposure groups
(1M0.5, 1M1.5, and 1M2.5) differed from the no-exposure
control group to test the hypothesis that the timing of exposure
would affect acceptance (timing hypothesis). Second, we con-
ducted separate ANOVAs with a priori contrasts that were
specified to determine whether 1 mo of exposure differed from
3 mo of exposure (1M0.5 group and the group with exposure
from 0.5 to 3.5 mo) and whether these groups differed from
the no-exposure control group (duration hypothesis). Because
3 comparisons were made for each outcome measure, a Bon-
ferroni adjustment was made such that only a planned com-
parison with P , 0.02 was considered significant.
Primary outcome measures for the mothers were gLMS ratings
of the juices and dietary intake over time, which were analyzed
with the use of repeated-measures ANOVAs with the type of juice
as the within-subject factor and the experimental group as the
grouping factor. Pearson correlations were conducted to determine
associations between continuous variables, and Fisher’s exact
probability tests were used to determine the effect of the group on
nonparametric data (e.g., demographics and parenting attitudes
toward vegetables). Analyses were conducted with the use of
Statistica software (version 12; StatSoft). All summary statistics
are expressed as means or least-squares means 6 SEMs.
RESULTS
Study participants
Of the 97 dyads who were randomly assigned, 77% of the
dyads completed the study. As shown in Supplemental Figure 1,
the remaining women dropped out of the study because they no
longer wanted to participate (n = 8), did not comply with the
drinking of the juices (n = 3), moved out of the area (n = 3), or
were lost to follow-up (n = 8). There were no differences in the
groups regarding the reasons why they did not complete the study.
Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of 75 dyads of mothers
and infants who completed the study. All but 3 women exclusively
breastfed for at least the first 3.5 mo of life (the remaining mothers
exclusively breastfed for 2.5 mo and predominantly breastfed
the subsequent month). The race/ethnicity of the dyads and the
mother’s highest educational level reflected the racial and socio-
economic diversity of the Philadelphia area (38). There were no
significant group differences in the weight-for-length z score, race-
ethnicity, sex ratio of the infants, or age of the infants at the time of
the vegetable acceptance tests, and there were no group differences
in maternal parity, education, income levels, or quality of the
maternal diet related to vegetable and fruit intake at study entry.
During the month of exposure for the experimental groups,
groups significantly differed in the number of times that mothers
breastfed their infants per day. For example, mothers in the 1M0.5
and 1M1.5 groups breastfed more often during the month that
they drank the juices (9.6 and 9.3 times/d, respectively) than did
those in the 1M2.5 group (7.6 times/d; F[2,43] = 5.65, P = 0.007).
Most infants (83%) were breastfed for .10 mo and, thus, were
breastfeeding at the time of the vegetable-flavor acceptance tests;
only 8% of the infants were weaned from the breast between the
ages of 3.5 and 7 mo. The groups did not differ in terms of when
mothers started complementing breastfeeding with solid foods
(P = 0.93); all infants were introduced to solid foods before the
age of 8 mo with most infants (67%) being introduced to solid
foods between 4 and 8 mo. Most lactating mothers (69%) pre-
pared their infants’ cereal with liquids other than water (e.g., fruit
juices, mother’s milk, and commercial baby foods). When
mothers introduced solid foods, they fed their infants pureed table
foods along with commercial baby foods; 20% of the mothers
never fed their infants commercial baby foods.
Infants: vegetable acceptance at weaning
The groups did not differ in terms of the timing of testing
relative to the number of hours since infants last fed (P = 0.22); the
infants were fed 2.6 6 0.1 h before the test sessions. Also, there
was not an effect of the order of presentation on intake of the
cereals (P = 0.81). Six infants refused to eat any food on all
3 testing days; 1 infant refused to eat on 2 test days, and 2 infants
refused to eat on 1 test day (Supplemental Figure 1, Table 2).
The repeated-measures ANOVA revealed a main effect of the
flavor of the food that the infants were eating. As a group, the
infants preferred some flavors more than others as was evidenced
by how much they ate (F[2,122] = 6.96, P = 0.001) and their
mothers’ perception of their enjoyment of the food (F[2,120]
= 14.47, P , 0.0000). Infants ate significantly more of the carrot-
flavored cereal (53.1 6 5.6 g) than either of the broccoli-flavored
cereal (32.8 6 4.9 g; P = 0.0003) or plain cereal (42.0 6 4.8 g;
P = 0.05). Likewise, mothers gave significantly higher scores,
although in the neutral range, when rating how much they thought
that their infants enjoyed eating the cereal that was flavored with
carrot juice (6.1 6 0.3) than either the broccoli-flavored cereal
(4.1 6 0.3; P = 0.0000) or plain cereal (4.6 6 0.3; P = 0.0003).
Table 2 shows the results of the planned comparisons that
followed from the timing and duration hypothesis. As shown in
Figure 2, the timing of when mothers drank the vegetable juices
affected their infants’ acceptance of the carrot-flavored cereal
but not of the plain or broccoli-flavored cereals (Table 2). Infants
who had 1 mo of exposure to the vegetable flavors beginning when
they were 2 wk of age were more accepting of the carrot-flavored
cereal as determined by how fast they ate the food (P = 0.008)
and how much they ate (P = 0.03). There were no differences
between the groups whose exposure began either at 1.5 or 2.5
mo and the control group. Timing was more important than
duration. The infants’ intake and rate of feeding the carrot-
flavored cereal was greater in those who had 1 mo of exposure,
but not 3 mo of exposure, than in the group with no exposure
(P , 0.02). One month of exposure was no different from 3
mo of exposure. Regardless of the timing and how long
mothers drank the juices, infants in the 4 experimental groups
tended to be less likely to display a facial expression of dis-
taste to their first spoonful of the carrot-flavored cereal (29%)
than were the control infants (53%; P = 0.08).

 Mothers: psychophysical ratings of vegetable flavors,
dietary intake, and attitudes about vegetables
Of the 75 women, 2 women did not participate in the gLMS
testing on 1 of the test days, and therefore, they were excluded
(Supplemental Figure 1). There was an interaction between the
type of juice and the time postpartum on how much mothers liked
or disliked the tastes of the juices (P = 0.02). At the start of the
study, mothers liked the taste of apple juice the best and the taste
of celery the least; vegetable juice was liked more than carrot
juice, which was similar in liking to beet juice (P = 0.0001).
Regardless of the experimental group, maternal hedonic ratings
for carrot (P = 0.002), beet (P = 0.001), and celery (P = 0.006)
juices increased over time (Figure 3). For carrot juice, the
change in liking first occurred on the second visit; ratings in-
creased from barely detectable dislike at baseline to weak like at
4.5 mo. For celery and beets, changes did not occur until the
third visit; hedonic ratings for celery went from weak-moderate
dislike to barely detectable-weak dislike and, for beets, went
from barely detectable like to weak-moderate like. Paralleling
the increases in liking were decreases in how bitter the mothers
rated each of these juices (carrots: P = 0.02; beets: P , 0.0001;
celery: P , 0.0001); there were no such time-related differences
in perceived sweetness (all P . 0.14). Hedonic ratings for the
more-preferred juices (i.e., apple and vegetable) did not differ
between the groups or over time.
Total daily caloric intake reported by the mothers did not
change during the exposure period (P = 0.67) and did not differ
by group (P = 0.38). Fruit intake significantly decreased over
time in all groups (P = 0.01) from 1.6 6 0.2 cups/d at 0.5 mo
postpartum to 1.1 6 0.1 cups/d at 4.5 mo. Vegetable intake (P = 0.91)
did not change. Like that observed at study entry, most mothers
did not meet the daily recommendations for either fruit intake
(81% of mothers ate ,2 cups/d) or vegetable intake (87% of
mothers ate ,2.5 cups/d) at 4.5 mo postpartum.
Regardless of the group assignment, all but one (99%) of the
mothers reported at the start of the study that it was either very
important or important to them that their children’s future diet
include vegetables. Mothers also reported that it was very im-
portant or important to them that their children’s diets also in-
clude fruit (99%) and, to a lesser extent, meats (76%).
DISCUSSION
The current study builds on the evidence base that mammalian
infants learn about the food environment in which they live and
their mothers’ diet during breastfeeding (13, 14, 39) and pro-
vides further evidence that there is a period during early life
when the hedonic response to food flavors experienced in
mother’s milk can be enhanced. Infants whose mothers drank a
variety of vegetable juices, including carrot juice, were more
accepting of cereal that was flavored with carrot juice (as de-
termined by intake and rate of feeding) than were infants in the
control group whose mothers drank water and avoided intake of
the same vegetables. One month of exposure was more effective
when it began at 0.5 mo postpartum than when it began at either
1.5 or 2.5 mo postpartum, which indicated a timing effect. In
infants whose lactating mothers began drinking the juices
shortly after birth (2 wk postpartum), those whose mothers

 drank the juices for 1 mo were more accepting of carrot-flavored
cereal than were infants whose mothers drank the juices for
3 mo, thereby indicating that the duration was less important
than the timing. But regardless of when and how long the flavor
exposure were, infants in each of the exposure groups displayed
fewer faces of distaste during the early parts of feeding than
control infants did, which indicated that there was a shift in the
hedonic tone of the carrot-flavored cereal.
Why was there an effect of the timing of exposure and not of
the duration on how much babies ate and how fast they ate the
carrot cereal? One hypothesis is that the timing was confounded
by compliance with the protocol. Mothers may have been more
motivated to drink the juices during the early postpartum period
perhaps because of the rewarding properties of lactating on the
mothers (40) or because drinking the juices for 3 mo was too
burdensome. However, there were no differences in the groups in
compliance or willingness to participate as was assessed by
dropout rates or the evaluation of the logs. Neither were there
group differences in maternal motivations because the vast
majority of mothers reported that it was important that their
children’s future diets include vegetables. Another hypothesis is
that the timing of exposure is related to the amount and frequency
that infants experience the flavors. Infants breastfeed more often
during the first few months of life, and thus, they may have more
opportunity to experience the flavors of vegetables in their
mothers’ milk. However, mothers who drank the vegetable juices
from 1.5 to 2.5 mo postpartum nursed as often as those who drank
the juices from 0.5 to 1.5 mo postpartum, and thus, changes in the
composition of milk (41) and the quantity of milk ingested by the
infants (42) may have contributed to a varying potency of flavor
experiences during the first 2.5 mo of life.
The timing of the plasticity of the neural substrates that un-
derlie the observed developmental transition in human flavor
learning remains unknown (43). Knowledge about the sensitive
periods for learning about flavors that are not associated with the
maternal diet (19, 29) and for other senses, particularly vision
(44), may shed light on aspects of flavor learning that have not
been explored. Most likely, there are multiple sensitive periods
especially because learning about flavors and foods does not end
with breastfeeding but continues throughout complementary
feedings (13). Changes in intake after repeated exposure to fruit
and vegetables during infancy contrast with slower changes
that have been shown in toddlers (45), thereby suggesting that
plasticity is more pronounced early (46). Such functional plas-
ticity, which one of the main characteristics of the brain, high-
lights the ability to change behavior on the basis of previous
experience (47).
Although the timing of exposure had significant effects on
infants’ acceptance of the carrot-flavor foods, as a group, only
8% (6 of 75) of the breastfed infants rejected all of the foods.
Although there was personal variation in feeding behaviors at
this age, most infants ate sufficient amounts, preferring the fla-
vor of carrot to broccoli and preferring the carrot-flavored cereal
to the unflavored cereal. In addition, infants in the experimental
groups liked the taste of the carrot-flavored cereal more than the
control infants did as was evidenced by the facial expressions

 that were made during the early part of the feeding. Such he-
donic shifts that are based on an experience with flavor in milk
may underlie the finding that breastfed infants are more ac-
cepting of flavored foods after repeated exposure to a vegetable
than are formula-fed infants (17). Mothers often used liquids
other than water to prepare the first complementary foods and
fed their infants commercial baby foods less often, which may
have been related to their infants’ greater acceptance of foods at
weaning (17) and the decreased likelihood that they will be picky
eaters as they grow (18). However, we showed no effect of
mothers drinking a variety of vegetable juices during lactation on
their infants’ acceptance of the novel broccoli-flavored cereal.
Two explanations, which are not mutually exclusive, are
suggested. First, although we established that the sensory prop-
erties of human milk change when mothers drink carrot juice
(20), to our knowledge, such research has not been conducted
with the other juices (e.g., beet and celery). Thus, infants may not
have been exposed to a variety of flavors. However, the evaluation

infants’ intake. Infants whose mothers drank a variety of juices (carrot, celery, vegetable, or beet) from 0.5 to 1.5 mo postpartum (1M0.5 group) ate more carrot-
flavored cereal and ate it at a faster rate than did those whose mothers did not drink the juices and avoided vegetables (control group). There were no differences
between the groups who drank the juices either from 1.5 to 2.5 mo (1M1.5 group) or from 2.5 to 3.5 mo (1M2.5 group) and the control group. (B) Effect of the
duration of maternal drinking of the vegetable juices on infants’ intake. Infants whose mothers drank the juices for 1 mo (1M0.5) ate more carrot-flavored cereal

 of the taste of mothers’ milk by sensory panelists in the 1980s
revealed a wide range of flavors that acted in an additive manner
(48). Second, the taste of green vegetables is initially disliked by
both infants and children (4). Because the rejection of a bitter
taste is inborn, a repeated experience with the actual bitter taste
of broccoli rather than an experience with the flavors of a variety
of vegetables may be required to shift the hedonic tone (13, 15).
Consistent with previous research (30), mothers were motivated
for and desired their children to have a healthy diet, which included
vegetables, fruit, and meats. Such beliefs and parenting practices
have been shown to be effective modifiers of vegetable and fruit
intake in children (49). In the present study, we focused on another
important barrier that needs to be addressed: how to get mothers to
like how vegetables taste. How much mothers liked the vegetable
juices increased over time, and how bitter the vegetable juices
tasted decreased over time; this pattern was particularly true for
the vegetable flavors that they initially did not like. Because the
mothers in the control group tasted each of these drinks during the
5 psychophysical test sessions at the Monell Center, mere exposure
to the taste, separated by as much as 1 mo (during nonexposure
periods), resulted in mothers liking the taste of the juices more over
time, which is a finding that is consistent with previous results that
relatively few repeated tastings of a bitter-sweet beverage can
significantly increase the hedonic evaluation of the taste of the
beverage in adults (28). However, although liking modestly in-
creased, vegetable and fruit intakes in these new mothers, as has
been reported previously (27, 50), was well below current rec-
ommendations, and fruit intake, which is typically higher during
pregnancy perhaps because of cravings for fruit (51, 52), began to
decrease, which highlighted the problem at hand. The monitoring
of changes in taste hedonics during future interventions may shed
light on how much of a hedonic shift and how much exposure are
needed to have a positive effect on vegetable intake. Pregnant
women and new mothers are often motivated to improve their diets
(53), and intervention studies have shown that they can change
food habits, but this change will require more than just tasting
vegetables a few times (54–57). In addition to taste, core barriers
for healthy eating that have been reported by caregivers include
a lack of meal preparation skills, difficulty in changing eating
habits, and costs and availability (58).
Getting children off to a healthy start requires more than
having their mothers eat vegetables during breastfeeding. Al-
though we have identified a period during early life during which
infants may be more receptive to learning about dietary volatiles
of vegetables in mothers’ milk, learning to like foods has to
continue throughout childhood. Although vegetables, in partic-
ular, have been most cited as being a food children do not like
(59), children learn through imitation and observation and the
contingencies between their action and its consequence; what
infants observe influences what they do, and what they do
changes behaviors (60). Children are quicker to try a new food,
and they like and eat more healthy foods such as fruit and
vegetables when the eating of these foods is modeled by an
important other, such as a parent (61–64). The more fruit and
vegetables that are eaten by the mother, the more likely it is that
her preschooler will follow her lead (65). Also, more fruit and
vegetables in the home result in greater consumption of fruit and
vegetables by the child at school (66). Because learning to like
healthy foods such as vegetables requires repeated and contin-
ued exposures to learn to like them, if vegetables are part of the
mothers’ own diets, the mothers will not consider buying veg-
etables to be a waste of money even if their children reject the
vegetables initially (67).
In conclusion, the challenge is to start early and to understand
how infants develop healthy eating patterns that are sustainable,
particularly in today’s food environment, which is rich in added
sugars. Also, starting early cannot only focus on children but
must also include their mothers and other family members. The
time is ripe to focus on the diets of women during motherhood
and, in turn, the types of foods the women proffer (and model) to
their children to learn how to better transition children to eating
healthy foods such as vegetables.
