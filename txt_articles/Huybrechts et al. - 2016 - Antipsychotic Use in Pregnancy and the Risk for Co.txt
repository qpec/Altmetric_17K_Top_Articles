Abstract
IMPORTANCE—The frequency of antipsychotic (AP) use during pregnancy has approximately 
doubled during the last decade. However, little is known about their safety for the developing 
fetus, and concerns have been raised about a potential association with congenital malformations.
OBJECTIVE—To examine the risk for congenital malformations overall and cardiac 
malformations associated with first-trimester exposure to APs.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS—This nationwide sample of 1 360 101 pregnant 
women enrolled in Medicaid with a live-born infant constituted the pregnancy cohort nested in the 
Medicaid Analytic Extract database, which included data from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 
2010. Participants were enrolled in Medicaid from 3 months before their last menstrual period 
through at least 1 month after delivery. Relative risks (RRs) were estimated using generalized 
linear models with fine stratification on the propensity score to control for the underlying 
psychiatric disorders and other potential confounders. Data were analyzed during 2015.

 EXPOSURES—Use of APs during the first trimester, the etiologically relevant period for 
organogenesis.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES—Major congenital malformations overall and cardiac 
malformations identified during the first 90 days after delivery.
RESULTS—Of the 1 341 715 pregnancies that met inclusion criteria (mean [SD] age of women, 
24.02 [5.77] years), 9258 (0.69%) filled at least 1 prescription for an atypical AP and 733 (0.05%) 
filled at least 1 prescription for a typical AP during the first trimester. Overall, 32.7 (95% CI, 
32.4–33.0) per 1000 births not exposed to APs were diagnosed with congenital malformations 
compared with 44.5 (95% CI, 40.5–48.9) per 1000 births exposed to atypical and 38.2 (95% CI, 
26.6–54.7) per 1000 births exposed to typical APs. Unadjusted analyses suggested an increased 
risk for malformations overall for atypical APs (RR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.24–1.50) but not for typical 
APs (RR, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.81–1.68). After confounding adjustment, the RR was reduced to 1.05 
(95% CI, 0.96–1.16) for atypical APs and 0.90 (95% CI, 0.62–1.31) for typical APs. The findings 
for cardiac malformations were similar. For the individual agents examined, a small increased risk 
in overall malformations (RR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.02–1.56) and cardiac malformations (RR, 1.26; 
95% CI, 0.88–1.81) was found for risperidone that was independent of measured confounders.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—Evidence from this large study suggests that use of APs 
early in pregnancy generally does not meaningfully increase the risk for congenital malformations 
overall or cardiac malformations in particular. The small increase in the risk for malformations 
observed with risperidone requires additional study.
Exposure to antipsychotics (APs) during pregnancy is increasingly common. Most newer 
atypical drugs are less likely to affect fertility than the older typical APs. This unimpaired 
fecundity combined with deinstitutionalization of patients with psychiatric illness and more 
widespread off-label use of these drugs have resulted in a doubling in the use of APs during 
pregnancy in the last decade.1,2
Since the first systematic review on this topic,3 clinicians continue to have very little 
information regarding the safety of these drugs for the developing fetus despite the growing 
use of atypical APs. Registry studies have been small (<250 exposed women) and have 
yielded mixed results; one study4 reported higher than expected rates of malformations 
(particularly cardiac), whereas another study5 did not find this association. Results from 
epidemiologic studies have also yielded inconsistent evidence. The 2 largest epidemiologic 
studies available to date—which included 570 and 561 exposed women6,7—reported a 1.5- 
to 2-fold increase in the risk for congenital malformations, in particular atrial and ventricular 
septal defects. Another study based on 151 exposed women1 suggested that atypical APs are 
not associated with an increased risk for major malformations. However, this study was 
underpowered to detect a less than 5-fold increase in risk. Given the need for additional 
information to enable psychiatrists and their patients to weigh the risks of using these 
medications during early pregnancy, our objective was to examine the risk for congenital 
malformations, and in particular cardiac malformations, associated with first trimester 
exposure to different APs in a large cohort.

 Methods
Data Source and Study Cohort
We used the pregnancy cohort nested in the nationwide Medicaid Analytic Extract database, 
which included data from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2010. The Medicaid Analytic 
Extract data include demographic and insurance enrollment information, medical visits and 
hospitalizations, inpatient and outpatient diagnoses and procedures, and prescriptions filled 
on an outpatient basis. The development of this cohort has been described in detail 
elsewhere.8 The cohort consisted of all pregnancies that resulted in live births for which 
Medicaid covered the health care expenses. Women and girls aged 12 to 55 years 
(hereinafter referred to as women) were required to have coverage through Medicaid from 3 
months before the date of their last menstrual period (start of pregnancy) to 1 month after 
delivery. Infants were required to have coverage through Medicaid for the first 3 months of 
life unless they died sooner. Pregnancies with exposure to a known teratogenic medication 
during the first trimester (n = 8246) and pregnancies with a chromosomal abnormality (n = 
2550) were excluded. This study was approved by the institutional review board of Brigham 
and Women’s Hospital, which waived the need for informed consent.
Antipsychotics
Exposure to AP was defined based on filling at least 1 prescription during the first 90 days 
of pregnancy (first trimester), which is considered the etiologically relevant period for 
organogenesis. We evaluated typical and atypical APs (eTable 1 in the Supplement) as 2 
separate classes, as well as the most frequently used individual medications, including 
aripiprazole, olanzapine, quetiapine fumarate, risperidone, and ziprasidone. Women were 
considered unexposed if they did not fill an AP prescription during the 3 months before the 
start of pregnancy or during the first trimester.
Congenital Malformations
The presence of congenital malformations was defined on the basis of inpatient or outpatient 
diagnoses and procedure codes from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth 
Revision (ICD-9) in the maternal (first month after delivery) or infant (first 3 months after 
date of birth) record. The maternal record was considered because Medicaid claims are 
sometimes recorded under the mother before the infant’s eligibility has been processed.9 We 
defined 13 specific malformation groups (central nervous system, ear, eye, cardiovascular, 
other vascular, respiratory, oral cleft, gastrointestinal tract, genital, urinary, musculoskeletal, 
limb, or other) and considered a malformation to be present if (1) an ICD-9 diagnosis was 
recorded for the specific malformation on more than 1 date, (2) a diagnosis was recorded on 
1 date as well as a relevant surgery or procedure code, or (3) a diagnosis was recorded on 1 
date and the infant died before 90 days. If the malformation was identified using codes from 
the maternal record only and these codes were also present during the first 105 days of 
pregnancy, the outcome was excluded under the assumption that it reflects a preexisting 
malformation in the mother. An infant was considered to have a major congenital 
malformation if any of the 13 specific malformations were present. Because of earlier 
findings of a possible increased risk,4,6,7 we evaluated the risk for cardiac malformations 
separately (eTable 2 in the Supplement).

 Covariates
We considered a broad range of potential confounders or proxies for potential confounders, 
including calendar year, age, race, smoking, multiple gestation, indications for APs, other 
maternal morbidity, concomitant medication use, and general markers of the burden of 
illness. Maternal morbidity and concomitant medication use were measured from 3 months 
before the start of pregnancy to the end of the first trimester. General markers of the burden 
of illness were assessed during the 3 months before pregnancy to avoid these measures of 
intensity of health care use being affected by early awareness of possible pregnancy 
complications (eFigure 1 in the Supplement). Indications for AP use included schizophrenia, 
bipolar disorder, psychosis, depression, anxiety, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and 
other psychiatric disorders. Other maternal morbidities included other psychiatric and 
neurologic conditions (personality disorder, adjustment disorder, delirium, sleep disorders, 
chronic fatigue syndrome, alcohol and other drug abuse or dependence, epilepsy or 
convulsions, migraine, and other headaches) and chronic maternal illness (diabetes, 
hypertension, renal disease, and obesity). Concomitant medications assessed included other 
psychotropic medications (anticonvulsants, antidepressants, anxiolytics, benzodiazepines, 
other hypnotics, barbiturates, and stimulants), antidiabetic medications, antihypertensives, 
and suspected teratogens, as well as methadone hydrochloride, naloxone hydrochloride, 
naltrexone hydrochloride, and opioid use as possible proxies for drug abuse or dependence. 
Finally, general markers of comorbid illness included the Obstetric Morbidity Index10 and 
numbers of distinct prescriptions for medications other than APs, distinct diagnoses, 
outpatient visits, hospitalizations, and emergency department visits.11
Statistical Analysis
Data were analyzed in 2015. Baseline characteristics were assessed in women treated and 
not treated with the various APs, and balance was assessed using the standardized mean 
difference. We calculated absolute risks for any congenital malformation and for cardiac 
malformations and unadjusted relative risks (RRs) with their 95% CIs. Use of the robust 
variance estimator to account for correlations within women with multiple pregnancies did 
not appreciably change the CIs, so correlation structures were omitted from all analyses.
In the first adjusted analysis, we accounted for psychiatric and neurologic conditions and the 
use of other psychotropic medications to adjust for the possible confounding effect of the 
underlying disease and its associated factors. In the second adjusted analysis, we accounted 
for all potential confounding variables described earlier. Given the large number of 
covariates considered, propensity scores (PS)—estimated using logistic regression—were 
used as a data reduction technique. We trimmed the cohort by excluding observations from 
the nonoverlapping regions of the PS distributions and created 50 equal-sized PS strata 
based on the distribution among the treated women.12 In the outcome models, the untreated 
observations were weighted using the distribution of the treated women among PS strata. 
Adjusted RRs were estimated using generalized linear models (PROC GENMOD [SAS 
Institute Inc] with a weight statement and loglink function).

 Sensitivity Analyses
Sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the robustness of the findings. To account for 
potential residual confounding, we conducted high-dimensional PS analyses that included 
200 empirically defined covariates, in addition to the investigator-defined covariates, to 
account for additional proxies of unmeasured confounders.13 To ensure that the results do 
not change when restricted to women with the main US Food and Drug Administration–
approved indications for APs, we restricted the treated and untreated populations to women 
with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or psychosis and adjusted for other psychiatric 
disorders. To evaluate the potential impact of exposure and outcome misclassification, we 
redefined exposure as having filled at least 2 prescriptions for an AP during the first 
trimester and having at least a 1-day supply that overlapped with the first trimester, and we 
defined the outcomes based on infant claims only. We evaluated the presence of a dose-
response association using strata based on dose tertiles for the first prescription filled during 
the first trimester. Because the cohort included live births only, we examined the potential 
impact of differences in the proportion of terminations among women treated with APs vs 
those untreated within levels of covariates used in the adjustment.14
Exploratory Analyses
Exploratory analyses were conducted to further test potential safety signals emerging from 
the study. We adjusted for high-dimensional PS in the analyses in which exposure was 
defined based on filling at least 2 prescriptions. We compared the risk for malformations 
between women who were treated with APs during the 3 months before the start of 
pregnancy and continued treatment during the first trimester (continuers) and women who 
discontinued treatment before the first trimester (discontinuers). The rationale for this 
analysis is that discontinuers might be more comparable to continuers than women who 
were never treated with APs. We increased the length of the gap between the last 
prescription fill and the start of pregnancy for the discontinuers (0, 4, 6, and 8 weeks) to 
reduce the likelihood of misclassifying as unexposed any women who still had medication 
from their last fill available to consume early in pregnancy. All analyses were conducted 
using the SAS System for Unix (version 9.3; SAS Institute Inc).
Results
The study cohort included 1 341 715 pregnancies (mean [SD] age of women, 24.02 [5.77] 
years) who met the inclusion criteria (eFigure 2 in the Supplement). Among those, 9258 
women (0.69%) filled a prescription for an atypical AP during the first trimester, and 733 
women (0.05%) filled a prescription for a typical AP. The most frequently used atypical AP 
was quetiapine (n = 4221), followed by aripiprazole (n = 1756), risperidone (n = 1566), 
olanzapine (n = 1394), and ziprasidone (n = 697). A total of 1 331 910 women had no AP 
dispensed from 3 months before the start of pregnancy through the end of the first trimester.
Women taking APs during the first trimester were older, more likely to be white, and more 
likely to deliver prematurely. They had a much higher burden of comorbid illness than 
untreated women as judged by the differences in baseline characteristics. They had more 
psychiatric and neurologic conditions and other comorbid conditions, used more

 psychotropic medications and suspected teratogens, and were generally in poorer health. 
These patterns were observed for atypical and typical APs and for each of the individual 
atypical agents (Table 1 and Table 2 and eTables 3–9 in the Supplement).
The absolute risks for congenital malformations overall per 1000 live-born infants were 
higher among treated women, with 38.2 (95% CI, 26.6–54.7) for those treated with typical 
APs and 44.5 (95% CI, 40.5–48.9) for those treated with atypical APs vs 32.7 (95% CI, 
32.4–33.0) for untreated women. Higher risks were also observed for women treated with all 
individual atypical medications, ranging between 37.3 and 51.1 per 1000. Likewise, 
increased risks for cardiac malformations were observed for all AP exposures (Table 3). 
Unadjusted analyses suggested a significantly increased risk for malformations overall for 
atypical APs (RR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.24–1.50) and for the individual agents within that class 
with the exception of ziprasidone (Figure 1A and eTable 10 in the Supplement). The 
findings for cardiac malformations were similar, but the effects were less precisely estimated 
(Figure 2A and eTable 10 in the Supplement). A small, nonsignificant increase in the 
unadjusted risk was seen for typical APs (RR for overall malformations, 1.17 [95% CI, 
0.81–1.68]; RR for cardiac malformations, 1.18 [95% CI, 0.64–2.18]).
These associations were attenuated when we adjusted for psychiatric indications, but the risk 
for malformations overall, although small, remained significantly increased for atypical APs 
(RR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.02–1.23), with the largest increase seen for risperidone (RR, 1.31; 
95% CI, 1.05–1.63) (Figure 1B). The corresponding RRs for cardiac malformations were 
1.15 (95% CI, 0.98–1.35) and 1.39 (95% CI, 0.96–2.01) for atypical APs and risperidone, 
respectively (Figure 2B and eTable 10 in the Supplement).
The AP-treated and untreated populations were well balanced in terms of baseline 
characteristics once we accounted for all potential confounding variables and their proxies, 
as evidenced by the absolute value of the standardized differences less than 0.1 (Tables 1 and 
2). In this fully adjusted analysis, the RR further shifted to the null for atypical APs for 
malformations overall (RR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.96–1.16) and for cardiac malformations (RR, 
1.06; 95% CI, 0.90–1.24). In contrast, the risk remained elevated for risperidone for overall 
malformations (RR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.02–1.56) and cardiac malformations (RR, 1.26; 95% 
CI, 0.88–1.81). None of the other medications were associated with an increased risk 
(Figures 1C and 2C and eTable 10 in the Supplement).
Sensitivity Analyses
Use of the high-dimensional PS and restriction to women with schizophrenia, bipolar 
disorder, or psychosis did not affect the findings, but the associations were less precisely 
estimated in the restricted analyses (eTable 11 in the Supplement). Redefining exposure as 
having filled at least 2 prescriptions for an AP or having at least a 1-day supply that 
overlapped with the first trimester also did not meaningfully change the results, although the 
association appeared to strengthen somewhat for risperidone in analyses based on filling at 
least 2 prescriptions (RR for any malformation, 1.46 [95% CI, 1.01–2.10]; RR for cardiac 
malformations, 1.87 [95% CI, 1.09–3.19]). Restricting the outcome definition to 
malformation codes in the infant’s record only did not alter the results (eTable 12 in the 
Supplement). We found no evidence of a dose-response relationship for any of the individual

 APs except for risperidone. Dosages of at least 2 mg/d were associated with an increased 
risk for cardiac malformation (RR, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.32–3.28) (eTable 13 in the Supplement). 
The RR for any congenital malformation associated with atypical AP use increased from 
1.05 to 1.09 and 1.14 after accounting for potential differences in the probability of 
termination of malformed fetuses among treated and untreated women, respectively, using 
the best estimates based on the literature (eResults in the Supplement).
Exploratory Analyses
Adjusting for the high-dimensional PS in analyses in which exposure was defined based on 
filling at least 2 prescriptions for risperidone did not attenuate the associations (eTable 14 in 
the Supplement). Finally, comparing risperidone continuers with discontinuers, the strength 
of the association between risperidone continuation and congenital malformations was null 
without a gap between the last prescription fill and the start of pregnancy for the 
discontinuers but increased in a monotonic manner when defining discontinuation with 
increasing levels of strictness (eTable 15 in the Supplement).
Discussion
We examined the association between AP use during the first trimester of pregnancy and the 
risk for congenital malformations overall and cardiac malformations in a cohort of 1 341 715 
Medicaid-insured women. We did not observe a significant increased risk for either outcome 
for typical or atypical APs after controlling for potential confounding by mental and 
physical comorbid conditions and their associated behaviors, with the exception of 
risperidone.
The small increase in absolute risk and RR for malformations observed with risperidone 
should be interpreted with caution because no apparent biological mechanism can readily 
explain this outcome, and the possibility of a chance finding cannot be ruled out. This 
finding should therefore be interpreted as a potential safety signal that will require follow-up 
in other studies, which also should attend carefully to confounding and have adequate 
statistical power. Ennis and Damkier15 reported an unadjusted RR of 1.5 (95% CI, 0.9–2.2) 
for risperidone for major congenital malformations based on a systematic review of the 
evidence available through May 2014 (432 exposed pregnancies). Although this estimate is 
similar to our unadjusted estimate (RR, 1.56), it is based on a population reference value 
with no confounding control. The extent to which this association can be attributed to 
confounding is therefore not known.
Our study has several strengths, including its large size. Our cohort included 9258 women 
exposed to an atypical AP during the first trimester compared with 570 in the largest study 
available to date.6 This number enabled us to assess the risks associated with individual 
agents. The richness of the source data allowed for careful control of potential confounders 
through the use of PS methods, including more than 50 variables in conventional analyses 
and more than 250 variables in high-dimensional PS analyses.
The study limitations are those characteristic of studies that use large health care utilization 
databases or nationwide registries and center around the potential for misclassification and

 selection bias. To guard against exposure misclassification (ie, false-positives), we favored 
specificity over sensitivity in our primary exposure definition, which required women to 
have filled a prescription during the first trimester. Requiring women to have filled at least 2 
prescriptions under the assumption that filling multiple prescriptions increases the likelihood 
that the medication is being taken as prescribed did not affect the conclusions. However, 
neither of these definitions guarantees that the medication was actually—although likely—
consumed during the first trimester. No risk for recall bias exists given the data source used, 
and no risk for false-negatives given that APs are not available over the counter. Similarly, 
we used a highly specific outcome definition because this will result in an unbiased estimate 
of the RR as long as the sensitivity is nondifferential. Using this definition, the risks among 
the unexposed were in line with expectations given the known prevalence of congenital 
malformations, and we previously reproduced the known associations between diabetes and 
overall and organ-specific malformations.16Moreover, the definition for cardiac 
malformations has previously been validated.17 The absence of a validation study for the 
noncardiac malformations is a limitation, however. Potential confounding by variables 
incompletely or not captured in the data source (eg, smoking, obesity, alcohol or other drug 
abuse or dependance, or body mass index) is not a major concern given our null findings. 
Whereas residual confounding could theoretically be an explanation for the increased risk 
observed with risperidone, it is unlikely to affect the findings for risperidone but not for 
other agents. Finally, a potential for selection bias exists because the cohort was restricted to 
live births. Spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, or planned terminations owing to congenital 
malformations diagnosed early in pregnancy would therefore be missed. Previous studies1,7 
have documented that the rate of therapeutic abortions may be 10% to 20% higher among 
AP users. The quantitative bias analysis that assessed the potential impact of such missed 
terminations suggested that selection bias is not a major explanatory factor for our findings.
Whenever possible, given incomplete knowledge regarding the reproductive safety profiles 
of many pharmacologic agents, medications should be avoided during pregnancy. However, 
frequently avoidance is not possible, as is the case for women with schizophrenia, bipolar 
disorder, or major depressive disorder, in which few alternative treatment options are 
available.
Conclusions
Our findings suggest that use of APs early in pregnancy does not meaningfully increase the 
risk for congenital malformation or cardiac malformation, with the possible exception of 
risperidone. The findings for risperidone should be viewed as an initial safety signal that will 
require confirmation in other studies.

 Key Points
Question
Does the use of antipsychotics during pregnancy increase the risk for congenital 
malformations?
Findings
In this cohort study of 1.3 million pregnant women, after accounting for psychiatric 
conditions and other potential confounding variables, no increased risk for congenital 
malformations was found for typical or atypical antipsychotics, with a possible exception 
for risperidone.
Meaning
These findings suggest that antipsychotics have no important teratogenic effects; the 
initial safety signal for risperidone requires further study.

Abbreviations: ADHD, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; AP, antipsychotic; PS, propensity scores.
aAll APs were administered orally except for risperidone in 22 users, who received injections.
bAll characteristics included in PS. To account for PS, the untreated observations were weighted using the distribution of the treated observations among 50 PS strata. Observations from the nonoverlapping 
regions of the PS distributions were trimmed.
cDetermined on the basis of information submitted to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services by individual states, which was based on information that had been collected and coded from Medicaid 
applications.
dIncluded fluconazole, methimazole, danazol, propylthiouracil, progestins, and corticosteroids. Women exposed to known teratogens (warfarin, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, antineoplastic 
agents, lithium, isotretinoin, misoprostol, and thalidomide) were excluded from the cohort.
eScores range from 0 to 45, with higher scores indicating greater comorbidity.

aAll characteristics included in PS. To account for PS, the untreated observations were weighted using the distribution of the treated observations among 50 PS strata. Observations from the nonoverlapping 
regions of the PS distributions were trimmed.
bDetermined on the basis of information submitted to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services by individual states, which was based on information that had been collected and coded from Medicaid 
applications.
cIncluded fluconazole, methimazole, danazol, propylthiouracil, progestins, and corticosteroids. Women exposed to known teratogens (warfarin, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, antineoplastic 
agents, lithium, sotretinoin, misoprostol, and thalidomide) were excluded from the cohort.
dScores range from 0 to 45, with higher scores indicating greater comorbidity.
