SUMMARY
Neural stem cell (NSC) transplantation can influence
immune responses and suppress inflammation in the
CNS. Metabolites, such as succinate, modulate the
phenotype and function of immune cells, but whether
and how NSCs are also activated by such immuno-
metabolites to control immunoreactivity and inflam-
matory responses is unclear. Here, we show that
transplanted somatic and directly induced NSCs
ameliorate chronic CNS inflammation by reducing
succinate levels in the cerebrospinal fluid, thereby
decreasing mononuclear phagocyte (MP) infiltration
and secondary CNS damage. Inflammatory MPs
release succinate, which activates succinate recep-
tor 1 (SUCNR1)/GPR91 on NSCs, leading them to
secrete prostaglandin E2 and scavenge extracellular
succinate with consequential anti-inflammatory ef-
fects. Thus, our work reveals an unexpected role
for the succinate-SUCNR1 axis in somatic and
directly induced NSCs, which controls the response
of stem cells to inflammatory metabolic signals
released by type 1 MPs in the chronically in-
flamed brain.
INTRODUCTION
Advances in stem cell biology have raised hopes that diseases of
the CNS may be ameliorated by non-hematopoietic stem cell
medicines (Martino and Pluchino, 2006). We have provided
compelling evidence that the transplantation of somatic neural
stem cells (NSCs) improves the clinico-pathological features of
animal models of inflammatory CNS disorders. Beyond the struc-
tural replacement of injured CNS cells, our work has shown that
transplanted NSCs engage in complex stem cell graft-to-host
communication programs, overall leading to trophic support
and modulation of adaptive and innate immune responses (Baci-
galuppi et al., 2009, 2016; Pluchino and Cossetti, 2013; Pluchino
et al., 2005, 2009b). Specifically, NSC transplants reduce the
burden of inflammation at site of injury (Pluchino et al., 2005,
2009a),decreasethenumberoftype1inflammatorymononuclear
phagocytes (MPs) (Cusimano et al., 2012), and promote
the healing of the injured CNS via yet poorly characterized
mechanisms.
However, the clinical translation of experimental NSC thera-
pies is still limited by the sources from which human NSCs
(hNSCs) are derived (Anderson et al., 2017), the intrinsic immu-
nogenicity of allogeneic hNSC lines (Ramos-Zu
´ n
˜ iga et al.,
2012; Rice et al., 2013), and the stability of the so-called ‘‘in-
tended clinical cell lot’’ (Anderson et al., 2017; Wright et al.,
2006). Autologous and stably expandable directly induced
NSCs (iNSCs) from patients’ dermal fibroblasts are emerging
as a valid alternative to NSC therapies (Lu et al., 2013; Meyer
et al., 2015; Thier et al., 2012). The direct reprogramming into
iNSCs avoids the laborious progression through a pluripotent
state and subsequent differentiation into desired lineages
described for induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology
(Meyer et al., 2015; Thier et al., 2012). Therefore, making stably
expandable iNSCs from somatic cells represents the most
feasible way of obtaining autologous brain stem cells for down-
stream clinical applications (Wo
¨ rsdo
¨ rfer et al., 2013). However,
the efficacy of directly reprogrammed iNSCs in treating inflam-
matory CNS disorders has not yet been tested.
In progressive forms of multiple sclerosis (MS), chronic CNS
inflammation is sustained by widespread activation of MPs
that include both CNS resident microglia and monocyte-derived
infiltrating macrophages (Mallucci et al., 2015). MPs are found in

 gray matter lesions, close to degenerating neurites and neuronal
cell bodies (Peterson et al., 2001), and in white matter lesions,
where the external rim of activated microglia is associated with
chronic tissue damage (Bramow et al., 2010; Prineas et al.,
2001). Areas of normal-appearing white matter are also charac-
terized by MP accumulation, which leads to the formation of
microglial nodules that drive disease pathology irrespective of
concomitant T cell activation (Moll et al., 2011). The detrimental
role of chronic MP-driven inflammation in progressive MS is also
supported by evidence in animal disease models, where its over-
all burden correlates with impaired neuronal function (Planche
et al., 2017), brain atrophy (Tambalo et al., 2015), and reduced
regenerative responses (Jiang et al., 2014).
Activation of MPs by pro-inflammatory stimuli causes a meta-
bolic switch toward glycolysis and reduced oxidative phosphor-
ylation (OXPHOS) (Kelly and O’Neill, 2015). Recent evidence
suggests that, within this metabolic rewiring, type 1 inflammatory
MPs accumulate succinate, with important pathophysiological
implications (Tannahill et al., 2013). Intracellular succinate inhibits
the activity of prolyl hydroxylases enzymes (PHDs), thereby sta-
bilizing hypoxia responsive element (HIF)-1a and inducing the
transcription of interleukin (IL)-1b (Tannahill et al., 2013). Further-
more, oxidation of succinate by succinate dehydrogenase (SDH)
repurposes mitochondria from ATP synthesis to reactive oxygen
species (ROS) production as additional pro-inflammatory signal
(Mills et al., 2016). Type 1 inflammatory MPs also release succi-
nate extracellularly and upregulate its cognate succinate recep-
tor 1 (SUCNR1), a G-protein-coupled receptor (also known as
GPR91), which functions as autocrine and paracrine sensor to
enhance IL-1b production (Littlewood-Evans et al., 2016).
As such, metabolism is emerging as an important therapeutic
target to modulate the activation of both macrophages (Kelly and
O’Neill, 2015) and microglia (Orihuela et al., 2016), and succi-
nate-related pathways have key immune modulatory functions
for acute and chronic inflammatory diseases (Ryu et al., 2003;
Tannahill et al., 2015).
Given the established immune modulatory properties of NSCs
(Pluchino and Cossetti, 2013), we hypothesized that NSCs may
exert their therapeutic effects in chronic neuroinflammation by
modulating MP metabolism toward reduction of secondary
CNS damage.
In this work, we investigated the molecular mechanisms that
underpin the capacity of somatic and directly induced NSCs to
counteract the metabolic changes of type 1 inflammatory MPs
both in vivo and in vitro. We show that transplanted iNSCs and
NSCs are functionally equivalent in ameliorating chronic neuroin-
flammation in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalo-
myelitis (EAE). Transplanted iNSCs/NSCs switch in the activation
profile of CNS-resident microglia and monocyte-derived infil-
trating macrophages toward an anti-inflammatory phenotype,
as well as reduce the levels of the immunometabolite succinate
in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). iNSCs/NSCs also decrease
extracellular succinate released by type 1 inflammatory MPs to
reprogram their metabolism toward OXPHOS in vitro. Mechanis-
tically, we show that succinate secreted by type 1 MPs elicits in
iNSCs/NSCs a signaling cascade downstream SUCNR1, which
enables their anti-inflammatory activity. This succinate-licensed
anti-inflammatory function of iNSCs/NSCs is mediated by the
secretion of prostaglandin (PG) E2, as well as by considerable
scavenging of extracellular succinate. Loss of Sucnr1 function
in NSCs leads to significantly reduced anti-inflammatory activ-
ities in vitro and in vivo after transplantation in EAE.
Our study uncovers a succinate-SUCNR1 axis that clarifies
how NSCs respond to inflammatory metabolic signals to inhibit
the activation of type 1 MPs in chronic neuroinflammation.
RESULTS
NSC Transplantation Ameliorates Chronic
Neuroinflammation and Is Coupled with Reduction of the
Immunometabolite Succinate in the Cerebrospinal Fluid
We first assessed the effects of the intracerebroventricular (icv)
transplantation at peak of disease (PD) of iNSCs or NSCs in
mice with MOG35-55-induced chronic EAE and compared it to
PBS-treated control EAE mice. Prior to transplantation, iNSCs
and NSCs were expanded, characterized (Figure S1), and
labeled with farnesylated (f)GFP in vitro. At 30 days post-trans-
plantation (dpt), iNSC and NSC transplants survived, distributed,
and integrated within the EAE brain and spinal cord (Figure S2).
Only a minority of retrieved fGFP+ cells (iNSCs: 2.1% ± 0.9%;
NSCs: 1.7% ± 0.1%) were proliferating (Figure 1A) or expressing
neuronal (Figure 1B), astroglial (Figure 1C), or oligodendroglial

 (Figure 1D) lineage markers (Figure S2). The majority (�75%) of
iNSCs surviving to transplantation were found instead not to
be expressing any of the neural lineage markers tested and local-
izing around meningeal perivascular niche-like areas close to
F4/80+ endogenous MPs (Figure 1E), as observed in somatic
NSC grafts (Cusimano et al., 2012; Pluchino et al., 2003). The
transplantation of iNSCs induced a significant and long-lasting
(up to 90 dpt) amelioration of EAE scores, which started from
15 to 20 dpt onward (Figures 1F and S2). Functional recovery
was also confirmed by computer-assisted automated gait anal-
ysis (Figure S2). Overall, icv-transplanted iNSCs were safe and
led to behavioral and pathological recovery.
We then analyzed the composition of CNS inflammatory infil-
trates via ex vivo flow cytometry in iNSC- and NSC-transplanted
versus PBS-treated control EAE mice. The transplantation of
iNSCs or NSCs had no effects on the fraction of CNS-infiltrating
T cells, B cells, and total MPs, as well as in that of CD3+/CD4+
T cell subsets (including Th1, Th2, Treg, ThGM-CSF, and Th17
subsets) at 30 dpt (Figure S3). Instead, iNSC- or NSC-trans-
planted EAE mice showed a significant switch in the activation
profile of CX3CR1+ cells with �1.5-fold decrease of the CD80+
type 1 inflammatory microglia and parallel increase of the
MRC1+
anti-inflammatory
microglia
(Figure
1G).
Likewise,
CNS-infiltrating (monocyte-derived) CCR2+ macrophages from
iNSC- or NSC-transplanted EAE mice underwent significant
phenotype switch with �1.3-fold decrease of the CD80+
type 1 inflammatory macrophages and parallel �1.8-fold
increase of the MRC1+ anti-inflammatory macrophages (Fig-
ure 1H). This effect was accompanied by a significant reduction
of the expression of the type 1 inflammatory MP marker induc-
ible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) by F4/80+ MPs in vivo (Figures
1I and S3).
We then analyzed the expression levels of the main pro- and
anti-inflammatory genes in the whole CNS. iNSC- and NSC-
transplanted EAE mice both exhibited significantly reduced
levels of interleukin-1 beta (Il1b) in the brain and spinal cord
and increased levels of mannose receptor C type 1 (Mrc1) in
the spinal cord, both at 10 dpt (Figure 1J).
We found no significant differences in blood-brain barrier
(BBB) permeability at 30 dpt when comparing iNSC-/NSC-trans-
planted with PBS-treated control EAE mice (Figure S3).
Finally, iNSC- and NSC-transplanted EAE mice accumulated
significantly reduced axonal loss (Figure 1K) and demyelination
(Figure 1L) in the spinal cord.
Given the established importance of metabolism in regulating
the phenotype and function of MPs, we investigated whether
NSC transplants affected the neuroinflammatory metabolic
microenvironment. To this end, we performed an untargeted
metabolic profiling of polar metabolites by liquid chromatog-
raphy coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) of matched CSF
and plasma samples (Table S1). PBS-treated control EAE mice
showed a significant increase of several CSF (but not plasma)
metabolites, among which succinate only peaked at 45 days
post-immunization (dpi) (corresponding to 30 dpt; Figure 1M).
EAE mice not subjected to surgery also showed a significant
increased succinate only in the CSF at 45 dpi (versus healthy
control mice), which was not different from the levels of succi-
nate in the CSF PBS-treated control EAE mice (Figure S3).
Whereas we did not detect any significant change in
plasma metabolite levels between iNSC/NSC-transplanted and
PBS-treated control EAE mice (Table S1), we found that the
transplantation of iNSCs or NSCs led to a significant drop in
CSF succinate at 30 dpt (Figure 1M; Table S1).
Further, we found no significant differences in CSF succinate
when comparing PBS-treated EAE mice versus EAE mice
injected icv with mouse fibroblasts (MFs) as control cells
(Figure S3).
Thus, iNSCs and NSCs directly injected into the EAE CNS
induce a specific phenotype switch of MPs, which is associated
with reduction of the immunometabolite succinate in the CSF
only and amelioration of chronic neuroinflammation.
NSCs Reduce Succinate Levels and Reprogram the
Metabolism of Type 1 Inflammatory M4 In Vitro
We then investigated the molecular mechanisms through which
iNSCs/NSCs display anti-inflammatory activities on type 1 MPs,
using an in vitro system that recapitulates the interactions
between MPs and iNSCs/NSCs. Naive bone-marrow-derived
macrophages (M4) were polarized into a type 1 inflammatory
phenotype with LPS (M4LPS), as described (Tannahill et al.,
2013). M4LPS were then co-cultured with iNSCs (M4LPS-iNSCs)
or NSCs (M4LPS-NSCs) in a trans-well system that avoids cell-
to-cell contacts (Figure 2A). Unpolarized M4 were used as
controls.
Microarray gene expression profiling showed significant tran-
scriptional changes in M4LPS with 7,401 genes affected (versus
M4; adjusted p value < 0.1; Figure 2B; Table S2) and 51 genes
differentially expressed in M4LPS-iNSCs or M4LPS-NSCs (versus

 M4LPS; adjusted p value < 0.1; Figures 2B and 2C; Table S2).
This latter set of genes was enriched in biological processes
related to positive regulation of leukocyte activation (GO:
0002696), myeloid leukocyte differentiation (GO: 0002761),
and immune system processes (GO: 0002376). Independent
qRT-PCR validation of selected M4 pro-inflammatory genes
confirmed significant downregulation of the expression levels
of Il12b, Il15, Il15ra, and Cd69, as well as the classical inflamma-
tory genes Nos2, tumor necrosis factor (Tnf), and Il1b in M4LPS-
iNSCs and M4LPS-NSCs (versus M4LPS; Figure 2D). This effect
was coupled with the concomitant upregulation of the expres-
sion levels of genes associated with an anti-inflammatory M4
phenotype, such as uronyl-2-sulfotransferase (Ust) and bone
marrow stromal cell antigen 1 (Bst1) (Al-Shabany et al., 2016;
Martinez et al., 2015), as well as arginase 1 (Arg1) and Mrc1
(versus M4LPS; Figure 2E). When iNSCs/NSCs were co-cultured
with lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated mouse BV2 microglial
cells as before, significant reduction of the expression levels of
the pro-inflammatory genes Nos2 and Il1b was also observed
(Figure 2F).
To link gene expression profiles with functional metabolic
states, we assessed the basal oxygen consumption rate (OCR)
and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) of M4LPS as readouts
of their tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and glycolytic activities,
respectively. We found a significant reduction of OCR and a sig-
nificant increase of ECAR in M4LPS (versus M4s). Instead,
M4LPS-iNSCs and M4LPS-NSCs underwent significant restora-
tion of both OCR and ECAR values (versus M4LPS; Figures 2G
and 2H), as observed in M4 switching to an anti-inflammatory
phenotype (O’Neill and Pearce, 2016).
In an effort to clarify the metabolic determinants of these
anti-inflammatory effects, we performed an untargeted LC-MS
analysis of the extracellular and intracellular small-molecule
metabolite content of M4LPS. As expected, LPS stimulation pro-
foundly changed the extracellular and intracellular metabolic
milieu of M4 (M4LPS) (versus M4; Table S3). In co-cultures,
M4LPS-iNSCs and M4LPS-NSCs both showed significant reduc-
tion of extracellular glutamate, GABA, and succinate (versus
M4LPS; Figure 2I; Table S3). Furthermore, M4LPS-iNSCs and
M4LPS-NSCs also displayed a significant reduction of intra-
cellular succinate and itaconate (versus M4LPS; Figure 2J;
Table S3).
Consistent with the reduction of succinate levels, we found
that M4LPS-iNSCs and M4LPS-NSCs exhibited significantly
reduced levels of HIF-1a, of the upstream protein pyruvate
kinase isozyme M2 (PKM2) (Palsson-McDermott et al., 2015;
Figure 2K), as well as of IL-1b (versus M4LPS; Figure 2L).
Altogether, these in vitro data provide evidence that iNSCs/
NSCs reduce the accumulation of both intracellular and extracel-
lular succinate in co-cultures with type 1 inflammatory MPs,
reprogramming them toward an OXPHOS anti-inflammatory
phenotype.
Succinate Signals via SUCNR1/GPR91 in Mouse and
Human NSCs
Given the importance of succinate as immunometabolic signal,
we investigated whether succinate released by type 1 pro-in-
flammatory MPs could regulate the activity of surrounding cells
in situ, including that of transplanted iNSCs/NSCs.
We found that transplanted iNSCs/NSCs detected in proximity
to meningeal perivascular areas (Figures 3A and 3B) and F4/80+
MPs (Figure 3C) expressed SUCNR1 in vivo in the CNS. SUCNR1
was also expressed at protein level on both iNSCs and NSCs
in vitro, but not in MFs (Figure 3D).
To further assess whether SUCNR1 in iNSCs/NSCs was func-
tionally activated by succinate, we investigated its downstream
signaling cascade in vitro. When exposed to succinate (Fig-
ure 3E; Rubic et al., 2008), 34.2% (±7.4%) of iNSCs and 31.7%
(±6.5%) of NSCs showed a release of intracellular calcium stores
(Figures S4 and 3F). This response was followed by a significant
upregulation of the phospho-p38 mitogen-activated protein
kinase (Figure 3G), indicative of its activation. We confirmed
the expression of SUCNR1 and SUCNR1 also in human fetal
NSCs (hNSCs) and human iNSCs (hiNSCs) (Figures 3H and 3I).
As in mouse iNSCs, succinate-dependent p38 signaling was
evoked in hiNSCs, but not in hiNSCs pre-treated with the selec-
tive SUCNR1 inhibitor 4c (Figure 3J).
Thus, mouse and human iNSCs and NSCs express functional
SUCNR1, which induces a signaling pathway downstream of its
stimulation with the immunometabolite succinate.
SUCNR1 Stimulation Initiates the Secretion of
Prostaglandin E2 by NSCs
To clarify the functional consequences of SUCNR1 signaling
in NSCs, we generated NSCs from mice lacking Sucnr1
(Sucnr1�/� NSCs) (Rubic et al., 2008; Figure S4). Compared to
control NSCs, Sucnr1�/� NSCs showed similar growth curves
and differentiation in vitro (Figure S4). However, when exposed
to succinate at different time points and concentrations,
Sucnr1�/� NSCs showed no upregulation of phospho-p38 (Fig-
ure S4). Stimulation with glutamate or ATP + thapsigargin
induced in Sucnr1�/� NSCs a calcium response similar to that
of control NSCs (Figure S4). On the contrary, succinate treat-
ment did not elicit release of calcium from intracellular stores
(Figure S4), which indicated a defective SUCNR1 signaling in
Sucnr1�/� NSCs.
We then performed a gene expression profiling microarray
following
treatment
with
succinate
in
control
NSCs
and
Sucnr1�/� NSCs (Table S4). We found that prostaglandin-endo-
peroxide synthase 2 (Ptgs2), the key enzyme in PG biosynthesis
encoding the inducible PTGS2, was the most upregulated gene
in succinate-stimulated control NSCs (log2 fold change 1.05),
but not in succinate-stimulated Sucnr1�/� NSCs (log2 fold
change �0.43; Figure 4A). We validated these results on Ptgs2
by qRT-PCR, confirming that its expression levels were signifi-
cantly upregulated (2.1- to 2.7-fold change) in succinate-stimu-
lated iNSCs and NSCs, whereas they were not in succinate-
treated Sucnr1�/� NSCs (Figure 4B).
Given the role of PGE2 as regulator of the immunosuppressive
effects of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) (Vasandan et al.,
2016; Yan
˜ ez et al., 2010), we tested its accumulation in tissue
culture media from iNSCs, NSCs, and Sucnr1�/� NSCs after
stimulation with succinate. iNSCs and NSCs, but not Sucnr1�/�
NSCs, showed significant (>2.5-fold) increase of their basal
release of PGE2 as early as 30 min after succinate. This succi-
nate-induced effect was abolished by pre-treatment with the
irreversible PTGS2 blocker SC-58125 (Figure 4C). As in mouse
iNSCs, exposure of hiNSCs to succinate elicited a significant

 increase of PGE2 concentrations in tissue culture media,
whereas again pre-treatment with either SC-58125 or 4c pre-
vented its release (Figure 4D).
To further extend the relevance of these findings to co-cultures
between NSCs and M4LPS, we analyzed the levels of PGE2 in tis-
sue culture media. We found that M4LPS-NSCs accumulated
higher levels of PGE2 compared to M4LPS, whereas pre-treat-
ment of co-cultured NSCs with SC-58125 significantly reduced
PGE2 levels (Figure 4E). SC-58125 pre-treatment of NSCs was
also coupled with a significant increase of Il1b expression in
M4LPS (Figure 4F) and with a reduction of OCR values indicative
of a pro-inflammatory phenotype (Figure 4G). However, we
noticed that NSCs pre-treated with SC-58125 retained some
residual anti-inflammatory effects on M4LPS compared to
Sucnr1�/� NSCs (Figure 4F). On the contrary, Sucnr1 loss of
function in NSCs completely abolished their anti-inflammatory
effects on M4LPS (Figures 4F and 4G). We also show that the
observed PGE2-dependent anti-inflammatory ability of NSCs is
conserved and relevant for human NSCs.
As such, hiNSCs induced a significant reduction of Il1b
expression in M4LPS in co-cultures (Figure 4H), which was
coupled with a restoration of OCR values (Figure 4I) and
increased PGE2 levels in tissue culture media (Figure 4J). These
effects were completely suppressed by pre-treatment of hiNSCs
with the selective SUCNR1 inhibitor 4c (Figures 4H–4J).
Thus, the activation of SUCNR1 signaling pathway in mouse
and human NSCs triggers the release of PGE2 leading to anti-in-
flammatory effects on type 1 MPs.
However, inhibition experiments targeting either PTGS2
or SUCNR1 anticipate that additional SUCNR1-dependent—
PGE2-independent—mechanisms are likely to play a key role
in the anti-inflammatory effects of NSCs.

 SUCNR1 Stimulation Triggers the Uptake of Succinate
by NSCs
Gene expression arrays of succinate-stimulated NSCs revealed
that, besides Ptgs2, NaCT/Slc13a5 was among the most upre-
gulated genes in wild-type (WT) NSCs (log2 fold change =
0.49), but not in Sucnr1�/� NSCs (log2 fold change = �0.12).
SLC13A5 is a dicarboxylate co-transporter known to be involved
in succinate transport (Srisawang et al., 2007). Given the consis-
tent depletion of succinate found both in vivo in the CSF of iNSC-
or NSC-transplanted EAE mice and in vitro in co-cultures with
M4LPS, we hypothesized that iNSCs/NSCs would activate
SLC13A5 to scavenge succinate.
We found that the expression of SLC13A5, as well as of the
high-affinity dicarboxylate co-transporter SLC13A3, were signif-
icantly increased in iNSCs and NSCs, but not in Sucnr1�/�
NSCs, upon succinate stimulation (Figure 5A). Similarly, hiNSCs
exposed to succinate upregulated the protein expression levels
of both these SLC13 co-transporters in vitro (Figure 5B).
We next investigated the role of these co-transporters by
measuring succinate uptake in iNSCs and NSCs. We found
that both iNSCs and NSCs significantly accumulated [14C]-
succinate (Figure 5C) while reducing the amount of extra-
cellular [14C]-succinate in tissue culture media (Figure 5D).

Sucnr1�/� NSCs neither accumulated
[14C]-succinate
intracellularly
nor
did
they deplete it extracellularly (Figures 5C
and 5D). Interestingly, Sucnr1�/� NSCs,
which we have shown to have no effects
on Il1b expression in M4LPS (Figure 4F),
failed to reduce the extracellular succi-
nate levels in co-cultures with M4LPS (Fig-
ure 5E). As further proof of the importance
of succinate depletion in modulating the
phenotype of type 1 pro-inflammatory
MPs, we show that treatment with active
recombinant
(r)SDH
complex
subunit
A is able to significantly reduce the expression of Il1b in M4LPS
(Figure S5).
Thus, SUCNR1 signaling in NSCs prompts the uptake of the
immunometabolite succinate, thereby depleting the available
extracellular pool sustaining the autocrine and paracrine activa-
tion of type 1 MPs.
Transplantation of Sucnr1 Loss-of-Function NSCs
Shows Impaired Ability to Ameliorate Chronic
Neuroinflammation In Vivo
To confirm the role of the succinate-SUCNR1 axis in mediating
the response of NSC grafts to succinate in vivo, we assessed
the effects of the icv transplantation of Sucnr1�/� NSCs in
mice with chronic EAE.
At 30 dpt, Sucnr1�/� NSCs survived, distributed, and inte-
grated within the EAE brain and spinal cord with no significant
differences compared to control NSCs (Figure S6). However,
the transplantation of Sucnr1�/� NSCs induced only a slight
recovery of EAE behavioral deficits versus PBS-treated control
EAE mice (EAE score—Sucnr1�/� NSCs: 2.9 ± 0.2; PBS: 3.6 ±
0.4), which was significantly less pronounced (50% of the effect)
than that observed in EAE mice transplanted with control NSCs
(EAE score—NSCs: 2.1 ± 0.3; Figure 6A).
Cell Stem Cell 22, 355–368, March 1, 2018
363
 Ex vivo flow-cytometry-based analysis of the composition of
CNS inflammatory infiltrates showed that transplantation of
EAE mice with Sucnr1�/� NSCs failed to shift the proportions
of type 1 inflammatory and anti-inflammatory MPs—including
CX3CR1+ microglia and CCR2+ monocyte-derived infiltrating
macrophages—in contrast with the effects of control NSCs (Fig-
ures 6B and 6C). Post mortem tissue pathology further
confirmed the reduced tissue-protective effects of Sucnr1�/�
NSC grafts (Figures 6D and 6E).
We then investigated the levels of PGE2 and succinate in
matched CSF and plasma samples from NSC-transplanted
and PBS-treated control EAE mice. We found that both
Sucnr1�/� NSCs and control NSCs failed to induce significant
changes of the levels of PGE2 in the CSF. Plasma PGE2 signifi-
cantly increased in EAE mice only (versus healthy controls), with
no treatment effect observed (Figure 6F). Importantly, whereas
transplantation of control NSCs reduced CSF succinate (HC:
5.524 3 107 a.u. ± 0.19; PBS: 9.35 3 107 a.u. ± 0.14; NSCs:
5.64 3 107 a.u. ± 0.44), Sucnr1�/� NSC grafts showed no effects
(Sucnr1�/� NSCs: 10.40 3 107 a.u. ± 2.59; Figure 6G).
These data confirm the requirement of a functional SUCNR1
signaling pathway in the regulation of the anti-inflammatory
and neuroprotective effects of NSC transplants in vivo and
underline the importance of succinate scavenging as a predom-
inant anti-inflammatory mechanism of action of NSCs.
DISCUSSION
There is an unmet clinical need to develop cellular and molecular
approaches to target core drivers of the pathophysiology of
chronic neuroinflammatory conditions that include progressive
forms of MS (Volpe et al., 2016). In principle, stem cells possess

 a therapeutic potential that is distinct from that of small mole-
cules and biologics and extend far beyond the classical regener-
ative medicine arena. Part drug and part device, stem cells could
work as biological disease-modifying agents (DMAs) that sense
diverse signals, migrate to specific sites in the body, integrate
inputs to make decisions, and execute complex response be-
haviors in the context of a specific tissue microenvironment
(Fischbach et al., 2013). All these attributes could be harnessed
to treat several disease processes, including the persistent
MP-driven inflammation and tissue degeneration that occur in
progressive MS.
Here, we used accessible, autologous, and stably expandable
iNSCs (Thier et al., 2012), as well as somatic NSCs, to investigate
the effects of brain stem cell transplantation in a mouse model of
chronic neuroinflammation, which mimics the inflammatory
cascade observed in progressive MS.
We found that the transplantation of iNSCs into the CSF circu-
lation of EAE mice promotes equivalent outcomes to those
previously observed in mice transplanted with somatic NSCs
(Pluchino et al., 2003). Transplanted iNSCs or NSCs induced sig-
nificant clinical amelioration, as well as reduced axonal and
myelin damage, with no significant reduction of BBB permeability
at 30 dpt. Further studies will help clarify whether changes of BBB
permeability or recruitment of inflammatory monocytes to the
CNS occur immediately following the transplantation of iNSCs/
NSCs. Whether such an effect is likely to change the main clinical
outcomes of diseases with high prevalence of CNS infiltration by
inflammatory cells, such as EAE/MS, is hard to anticipate.
Instead, we found that our paradigm of transplantation was
associated with a specific switch in the activation profile of
both CX3CR1+ microglial cells and CCR2+ monocyte-derived
infiltrating macrophages with a decrease of the CD80+ type 1
inflammatory MPs and parallel increase of the MRC1+ anti-in-
flammatory MPs. Transplanted iNSCs/NSCs distributed and sur-
vived in the CNS of EAE mice, while preferentially accumulating
at the level of meningeal perivascular areas in juxtaposition to
endogenous MPs. Altogether, these findings would imply the
presence of some yet unknown mechanisms of intercellular
coupling between grafted stem cells and inflammatory MPs.
Whether this iNSC/NSC-MP communication in vivo takes place
only in perivascular niches or also at the level of other emerging
immune sensor-like structures of the brain that include the
choroid plexus remains to be addressed (Ge et al., 2017).
We then investigated the underlying immunological mecha-
nisms driving the beneficial effects of NSCs on MPs during
chronic neuroinflammation. Untargeted small molecule analysis
of matched CSF and plasma samples revealed profound meta-
bolic changes in the CSF of EAE mice, with differences between
the early and the delayed phases of disease.
Carnitine, leucine + isoleucine, citrulline, allantoin, ornithine,
and uric acid were all significantly increased in the PBS-treated
control EAE mice at the peak of disease. Our findings are consis-
tent with published evidence showing that leucine, as well as uric
acid and its by-product allantoin, are all increased in the CSF of
subjects with MS (Amorini et al., 2009; Hooper et al., 1998;
Monaco et al., 1979). Whereas increased CSF carnitine has not
been reported in MS, important increases have been described
in non-MS inflammatory conditions of the CNS, such as enceph-
alitis (Wikoff et al., 2008) and meningitis (Shinawi et al., 1998).
Conversely, only succinate showed a delayed (i.e., 45 dpi) in-
crease in the CSF of PBS-treated control EAE mice. Succinate is
becoming a valuable in vivo biomarker of metabolic distress and
inflammatory activity (Littlewood-Evans et al., 2016; Mills and
O’Neill, 2014). Importantly, we found that succinate was signifi-
cantly decreased in the CSF of iNSC-/NSC-transplanted mice.
The reduction of CSF succinate following iNSC or NSC trans-
plantation was of interest and might have a prominent role in
interfering with chronic neuroinflammation.
Succinate released from type 1 inflammatory MPs is a key in-
flammatory signal that interacts with its specific G-protein-
coupled receptor SUCNR1. SUCNR1 acts as an early detector
of metabolic stress in several physiological and pathological
conditions, including renin-induced hypertension, ischemia/
reperfusion injury, inflammation, platelet aggregation, and retinal
angiogenesis (de Castro Fonseca et al., 2016; Gilissen et al.,
2016). Notably, we found that the expression of SUCNR1 is
required for the therapeutic effects of transplanted NSCs in vivo.
Succinate-mediated activation of SUCNR1 on rodent and hu-
man iNSCs and NSCs activates calcium signaling and mitogen-
activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation in vitro, thus
eliciting the acquisition of a concerted anti-inflammatory pheno-
type in NSCs. On the one hand, SUCNR1 activated the secretion
of PGE2, a well-established pleiotropic immune modulator,
whose function targets multiple cell types within the inflamed
microenvironment, including MPs (Kota et al., 2017; Vasandan
et al., 2016). On the other hand, succinate-SUCNR1 signaling
in iNSCs and NSCs led to the upregulation of two members of
the
SLC13
family
of
co-transporters
(i.e.,
SLC13A3
and
SLC13A5) and uptake of extracellular succinate.
In vivo, we demonstrate effective scavenging of extracellular
local succinate by NSCs injected in EAE mice through the CSF
circulation, which is predominant, compared to the secretion
of PGE2. The loss of SUCNR1-dependent signaling in trans-
planted NSCs led to significant reduction in their anti-inflamma-
tory and neuroprotective effects, whereas Sucnr1�/� NSC grafts
showed no difference of survival, distribution, and differentiation
versus control NSCs.
We then hypothesize that the extracellular succinate secreted
by type 1 inflammatory MPs initiates a scavenging behavior that
transplanted NSCs adjust in response to increased substrate
availability (Srisawang et al., 2007). This novel intercellular meta-
bolic coupling fits well with the available literature showing that,
within specific microenvironments, cells compete for available
nutrients, affecting each other’s function and fate (Pearce and
Pearce, 2013).
We anticipate that succinate depletion by SUCNR1-express-
ing iNSCs and NSCs might play a crucial role in reducing the
availability of a key metabolic signal in inflammatory contexts
where the interactions between transplanted stem cells and
host immune cells become complementary (Pluchino and
Cossetti, 2013). More generally, our findings are in line with the
provocative, yet still emerging, concept of NSCs as ancestral
guardians of the brain capable of exerting several complemen-
tary immune modulatory and tissue trophic effects (Martino
and Pluchino, 2007).
Additional studies are needed to further characterize the
function of the succinate-SUCNR1 axis in neuro-immune inter-
actions, provide additional insights on the critical role of cellular

 metabolism for neural stem/progenitor cells (Knobloch and
Jessberger, 2017), and develop complementary pharmacolog-
ical interventions targeting this pathway in the chronically
inflamed brain.
In conclusion, we show here that NSCs sense the extracellular
succinate that accumulates in the chronically inflamed CNS to
ameliorate neuroinflammation via succinate-SUCNR1-depen-
dent mechanisms. Our work identifies a novel anti-inflammatory
mechanism that underpins the regenerative potential of somatic
and directly induced NSCs, thus paving the way for a new era of
personalized stem cell medicines for chronic inflammatory and
degenerative neurological diseases.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Six independent in vivo transplantation studies were performed on a total n = 175 C57BL/6 female mice (weight 20 gr) affected by
myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) (Pluchino et al., 2003).
Mice were housed in a controlled environment with a 12:12 hr light-dark cycle with food and water provided ad libitum. This research
has been regulated under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 Amendment Regulations 2012 following ethical review by the
University of Cambridge Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Body (AWERB). Animal work was covered by the PPL 80/2457 (to S.P.).
All human cell lines were cultured at 37�C in a controlled humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Human BJ fibroblasts (hBJFs) were
purchased from ATCC (CRL-2522) and cultured as adherent cells in hBJF medium [DMEM high glucose (GIBCO), 10% FBS, 1%
GlutaMAX (GIBCO), 1% pen/strep (Invitrogen)] until they reached confluency (80%–90%). The day of passage, hBJFs were washed
with PBS. Trypsin (0.05% in DMEM) was added at 37�C and inactivated after for 3 min with hBJF medium (2:1). Cells were collected
and then split 1:3 for expansion.
Human induced Neural Stem Cells (hiNSCs) were obtained from direct reprogramming of hBJFs in Edenhofer’s lab, as previously
described (Meyer et al., 2015). Briefly, hBJFs were infected with Oct4-, Klf4-, Sox2- and c-myc-Sendai viruses and cultured in neuro-
induction medium (NIM) [1:1 DMEM/F12 (Life Technologies): NeuroCultTM basal medium (GIBCO), 1X B27 (GIBCO), 1X N2
(ThermoFisher), 1% pen/strep (Invitrogen), 1% GlutaMAX(GIBCO), 10 ng/ml hLIF (GIBCO), 3 mM ChiR (Axon MedChem), 2 mM SB
(Invitrogen)]. 17 days after infection cultures showed morphological changes and NSC colonies formation. hiNSCs were cultured
as adherent monolayers in NIM and culture media was completely replaced every other day. When cells reached confluency of
50%–60%, they were enzymatic dissociated with AccumaxTM (Ebioscience) at 37�C for 5 min. Cells were then centrifuged at
300 g for 5 min and re-plated 1:6 on 6 well plates pre-coated with MatrigelTM (BD Bioscience). 10 mM ROCK inhibitor Y27632
(Calbiochem) was added upon seeding. Mycoplasma negative human cells at passage n % 20 were used in all experiments. RNA
and protein extracts from human fetal NSCs (hNSCs) (Mazzini et al., 2015) were provided by Angelo Vescovi (Milano, Italy).
All mouse cell lines were cultured at 37�C in a controlled humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Mouse induced Neural Stem Cells
(iNSCs) were obtained from direct reprogramming of Oct4-GiP Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEFs) from C57BL/6 mice in
Edenhofer’s lab. Briefly, Oct4-GiP MEFs were infected with retroviruses encoding for Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc, as previously described
(Thier et al., 2012). iNSCs colonies were picked 19 days post infection and cultured as either small cellular aggregates (i.e., neuro-
spheres) or adherent monolayers in iNSCs medium [DMEM/F12 (Life Technologies), 1% pen/strep (Invitrogen), 1X N2
(ThermoFisher), 10 ng/ml purified human recombinant (EGF, Peprotech), 10 ng/ml human recombinant basic fibroblast growth factor
(bFGF, Peprotech)]. For maintenance of adherent cells, laminin (1:100, Roche) was added to the iNSCs medium upon seeding. When
neurospheres reached a diameter of 150-200 mm (or confluency of 70%–80% for adherent cells), cells were collected and harvested
in a 15 mL tube (Falcon) and centrifuged at 300 g for 8 min. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was dissociated by enzy-
matic digestion with AccumaxTM (Ebioscience) at 37�C for 10 min. In case of adherent cells, culture medium was instead removed,
cells were washed in PBS, detachment was performed with AccumaxTM (Ebioscience) at 37�C for 10 min. Then fresh iNSCs medium
was added, and cells were centrifuged at 300 g for 8 min. The number of viable cells was determined by trypan blue exclusion and
viable cells were re-seeded at clonal density 9,700 cells/cm2. New iNSCs medium was added to each flask every other day.
Mycoplasma negative iNSCs at passage n % 25 were used in all experiments.
Somatic NSCs and Sucnr1�/� NSCs were obtained in Pluchino’s lab from the subventricular zone (SVZ) of 7-12 week old (18-20 g)
female C57BL/6 mice (Charles River, UK) and Sucnr1�/� C57BL/6 mice (Rubic et al., 2008) respectively, as previously described
(Vescovi and Snyder, 1999). C57BL/6 Sucnr1�/� mice were provided by Jose
´ M. Carballido (Novartis) (Rubic et al., 2008). Briefly,
mice were humanely culled by cervical dislocation followed by decapitation, the parietal bones were cut cranially to caudally using
micro-surgery scissors, and the brains removed. A brain slice matrix was used to obtain 3 mm thick brain coronal sections starting

 from 2 mm after the anterior pole of the brain. The SVZ of the lateral ventricles was isolated from coronal sections using iridectomy
scissors. Tissues derived from at least 2 mice were pooled to generate cultures. Dissected tissues were transferred to a 15 mL tube
with digestion medium [early balance salt solution (EBSS, GIBCO), papain (1 mg/ml, Worthington), ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid
(EDTA) (0.2 mg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich) and L-cysteine (0.2 mg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich)] and incubated for 45 min at 37�C on a rocking plat-
form. At the end of the incubation, the tube was centrifuged at 200 g for 12 min, the supernatant was removed and the pellet was
mechanically disaggregated with 2 mL of EBSS. The pellet was centrifuged again at 200 g for 12 min and then dissociated with a
200 mL pipette and seeded in complete growth medium (CGM). CGM was constituted of mouse NeuroCultTM basal medium
(Stem Cell Technologies) plus mouse NeuroCultTM proliferation supplements (Stem Cell Technologies) added with 2 mg/ml heparin
(Sigma-Aldrich), 20 ng/ml EGF and 10 ng/ml bFGF. After approximately 4-7 days, a small percentage of the isolated cells begun to
proliferate, giving rise to neurospheres. When neurospheres reached the necessary dimension (150-200 mm diameter), the cells were
harvested in a 15 mL tube and centrifuged at 100 g for 8 min. The supernatant was then removed and the pellet dissociated by enzy-
matic digestion with AccumaxTM at 37�C for 10 min. The number of viable cells was determined by trypan blue exclusion and viable
cells were re-seeded at clonal density 8,000 cells/cm2. Mycoplasma negative NSCs at passage n % 25 were used in all experiments.
Mouse Fibroblasts (MFs) were prepared in Pluchino’s lab from the kidneys of adult C57BL/6 female mice as previously described
and immortalized (Grupp and M€
uller, 1999). MFs were cultured as adherent cells in fibroblasts medium [DMEM high glucose (GIBCO),
10% FBS, 1% GlutaMAX (GIBCO), 1% pen/strep (Invitrogen)] until they reached confluency (80%–90%). The day of passage, cells
were washed with PBS. Trypsin (0.05% in DMEM) was added at 37�C and inactivated for 3 min with fibroblasts medium (2:1). Cells
were collected and then split 1:3 for expansion.
Bone marrow derived macrophages (M4) were obtained in Pluchino’s lab from the bone marrow of C57BL/6 female mice, as pre-
viously described (Masters et al., 2010). Briefly, 9-10 weeks-old C57BL/6 female mice were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane and
killed by cervical dislocation. Bone marrow was flushed from femurs and tibiae and bone marrow progenitor cells were cultured
for 6 days on Petri dishes (Thermo Scientific) in M4 medium [DMEM high glucose (GIBCO), 10% FBS, 1% pen/strep (Invitrogen)
and 10% of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) conditioned media from L-929 fibroblast cells].
L-929 fibroblast (NCTC clone 929) cells were purchased from ATCC and grown as adherent cells in L-929-medium [RPMI media,
10% Foetal Calf Serum (GIBCO) and 1% pen/strep (invitrogen)] until they reached confluency (80%). The day of passage cells were
washed with PBS. Trypsin (0.05% in DMEM) was added at 37�C and inactivated after for 10 min with, L-929-medium (2:1). Cells were
collected and spun at 300 g for 5 min, and then re-seeded 1:10. Conditioned medium was collected from cultures and filtered through
a membrane filter (0.22 mm pore diameter) to remove cells and debris and frozen (�80�C) until use. M-CSF conditioned media from
L-929 fibroblast cells were used for M4 cultures unless otherwise stated.
The BV2 microglial cell line was provided by Maria Grazia Spillantini (Cambridge, UK). For normal expansion, cells were cultured in
BV2 expansion medium [DMEM high glucose (GIBCO), 2% FBS, 1% pen/strep (Invitrogen)] until they reached confluency (70%). The
day of passage cells were washed with PBS. Trypsin (0.05% in DMEM) was added at 37�C and inactivated after for 3 min with BV2
expansion medium (2:1). Cells were collected and spun at 300 g for 5 min, and then re-seeded at 4,200 cells/cm2 for expansion.
METHOD DETAILS
Mouse iNSC/NSC proliferation, viability and differentiation in vitro
Cellular viability of iNSCs/NSCs was assessed by vital stain exclusion (trypan blue staining) and a continuous growth curve was built
up by seeding cells at clonal density. The linear growth curve was generated extimating the total number of cells by multiplying the
growth rate (i.e., number of live cells divided by the number of seeded cells) for the total number of cells present at the previous time
point. The mean number of cells per time point (±SEM) was reported to build the linear trend line. The daily growth rate was obtained
dividing the growth rate by the number of days per passage. Viability was defined as the percentage of viable cells over dead cells
(±SEM). For differentiation, cells were seeded on 13 mm glass coverslips pre-coated with MatrigelTM (8x104 cells/coverslips, BD
Bioscience) and cultured in 400 mL differentiation medium [NeuroCultTM basal medium (Stem cells Technologies), 10% mouse dif-
ferentiation supplement (Stem cells Technologies), 1% pen/strep (Invitrogen)], as previously described (Pluchino et al., 2008). Half
of the medium was replaced with fresh differentiation medium after 3 days. After 3 more days (6 days in total), coverslips were washed
with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA, Sigma-Aldrich) and 2% sucrose in PBS.
For immunofluorescence staining, cells were rinsed with PBS, and then blocked for 1 hr at room temperature (RT) in blocking buffer
(0.1% Triton X-100 and 10% secondary antibody species serum in PBS). The following primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer
were used: anti-nestin (1:200, Abcam), anti-SOX2 (1:100, Abcam), anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (1:500, Abcam), anti-
b-tubulin-III (1:500, Covance), anti-O4 (1:400, R&D). Primary antibodies were incubated at 4�C overnight. Cells were then washed
in PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100 and incubated with the appropriate fluorescent secondary antibodies (1:1,000 Alexa Fluor 405,
488, 555, 647, Invitrogen) 1 hr at RT. After washing in PBS, nuclei were counterstained with 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)
(1:10,000, Invitrogen) for 3 min and then mounted with Dako mounting kit (Fluka). Nonspecific staining was observed in control
incubations in which the primary antibodies were omitted. For quantification, images were acquired on a CCD camera (DC 480, Leica)
under a fluorescence microscope (Olympus, BX51) with a 40X objective on 6 regions of interest (ROI) of each coverslip. Images were
analyzed and prepared using ImageJ software. Data were represented as the percentage of positive cells over the total of DAPI pos-
itive cells ± SEM, from a total of n R 3 independent experiments.

 Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis
For the analysis of the expression of surface molecules on iNSCs/NSCs, cells were harvested and dissociated for counting, as
previously described. A total of 5x105 cells were kept in the blocking solution [2% FBS (GIBCO) in PBS] for 15 min. Cells were
then incubated for 30 min, at RT with fluorescence-conjugated antibodies: anti-CD44-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) (1:100,
BD Biosciences), anti-alpha-4-integrin-phycoerythrin (PE) (1:100, Abcam), anti-L-selectin-allophycocyanin (APC) (1:100, BD
Biosciences), anti-CX3C chemokine receptor 1 (CX3CR1)-PE (10 ml, R&D), anti-CXC chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4)-PE (1:3,
BD Biosciences), anti-C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2)-APC (10 ml, R&D). After incubation cells were rinsed with PBS and fixed
in 0.5% PFA in PBS. FACS analyses were carried out on a Cyan-ADP (Dako Cytomation) and data were analyzed using FlowJo
(Treestar).
Ex vivo FACS characterization of inflammatory infiltrates was performed as it follows. Mice were deeply anesthetized, perfused
with saline-EDTA. Tissues were isolated, kept in ice-cold complete IMDM medium [5% FBS, 1% GlutaMAX (GIBCO), 1% pen/strep
(Invitrogen) in IMDM (GIBCO)], sectioned into small pieces (z5-10 mm3) and incubated at 37�C with 1 mL of digestion buffer [2 mg/ml
collagenase (Sigma), 0.2 mg/ml dispase (MP Bio), 0.1 mg/ml DNase (New England) in complete IMDM medium] on a shaking platform
for 30 min at 700 rpm. After digestion, the cloudy suspension was filtered through 70 mm cell strainer and 9 mL of complete IMDM
medium was added.
To remove myelin and debris, 3.3 mL of isotonic 90% percoll solution was added to the samples. Samples were gently mixed and
centrifuged at 800 g for 20 min at 4�C with brake speed 0. Myelin debris were carefully removed and pellets were washed 2 times in
cold buffer [5% autoMACS Rinsing Solution (Milteny) in 1x MACS BSA solution (Milteny)] and centrifuged at 300 g for 5 min at 4�C.
Pellets were then suspended in 100 mL of cold buffer, counted and CD45+ cells sorted using CD45- separation beads (Milteny) and LS
columns (Milteny). Cell number was adjusted by pulling together n = 2 EAE mice from the same treatment group and sorting were
performed according to manufacturer’s recommendations. After sorting, cells were divided in two different staining protocols.
1x106 CD45+ cells/sample were incubated with rat anti-mouse FcyIII/II receptor (CD16/CD32) blocking antibodies (1:50, BD) for
10 min at 4�C. Samples were then incubated for 30 min at 4�C with the following antibodies: FITC-CD11b (1:200, BD), BUV395-
CD3e (1:100, BD), PE-Cy7-CD19 (1:100, BD), APC/Cy7-F4/80 (1:20, Biolegend), AlexaFluor594-GR-1 (1:50, Biolegend), PE-CX3CR1
(1:500, Biolegend), AlexaFluor647-CCR2 (1:50, Biolegend), BV605-CD80 (1:100, BD) and Brilliant Violet 711-CD206/MRC1 (1:40,
Biolegend). 7-amino-actinomycin D (7AAD) (1:50, Biolegend) was used to stain dead cells.
1x106 CD45+ cells/sample were instead seeded with lympho-medium [10% FBS, 1% GlutaMAX (GIBCO), 1% pen/strep (Invitro-
gen), 10 mM HEPES (Sigma), 55 mM b-mercaptoethanol (GIBCO), 1 mm sodium pyruvate (GIBCO) in RPMI medium (GIBCO)] in a 12
well plate (1x106 CD45+ cells/well). Cultured cells were supplemented with 1x Leukocyte Activation Cocktail (GolgiPlug, BD) and
incubated for 4 hr at 37�C and 5% CO2. Cells were then harvest and incubated for 30 min at 4�C with the following antibodies:
BUV395-CD3e (1:100, BD), AlexaFluor 647-CD4 (1:100, BD), BV786-IL-4 (1:100, BD), BV421-GM-CSF (1:100, BD), PerCP-Cy5.5-
IL-17A (1:100, BD), AlexaFluor 488-Foxp3 (1:100, BD), PE-RORgt (1:100, BD) and AlexaFluor 700-IFN-g (1:100, BD). LIVE/DEAD
Fixable Cell stain Kit (ThermoFisher) was used to stain dead cells.
Ex vivo FACS samples were acquired using a BD LSRFortessa cell analyzer flow cytometer and data were analyzed using FlowJo
(Treestar). Fluorochrome compensation was performed manually based on single color-marked samples and/or compensation
beads (BD Biosciences) when appropriate. All gates were set based on specific fluorescence minus one (FMO) control samples.
The following hierarchical gating strategy was employed: 1) exclusion of doublets on an area (FSC-A) versus peak (FSC-H)
plot; 2) exclusion of debris on a physical parameter plot (FSC-A versus SSC-A); 3) dead cells were excluded by 7AAD or LIVEDEAD
staining; and 4) phenotypic identification of subpopulations (combination of up to 8 markers).
Type-1 inflammatory M4 or BV2 cells co-cultures with iNSCs/NSCs
After 6 days from bone marrow isolation, M4 were re-seeded with fresh M4 medium on 6 or 12 well plates (5x105 or 1x105 cells/well
respectively) for co-culture experiments. For gene microarrays and metabolomic studies, recombinant mouse macrophage colony-
stimulating factor (M-CSF) (50 ng/ml, Miltenyi Biotec) and dialyzed (d)FBS were used instead of M-CSF conditioned media from
L-929 fibroblast cells and FBS. After 18 hr from re-seeding, M4 were stimulated by adding 50 ng/ml LPS (Enzo life sciences). To
assess the metabolic profile of LPS-activated type-1 inflammatory M4 (M4 LPS), intracellular and extracellular metabolites were
collected at given time points (see also section: Metabolite extraction and LC-MS analysis).
For co-culture experiments, treatment cells were dissociated, counted and re-suspended directly in M4 medium. For co-culture
experiments in which specific blockers were used, iNSCs/NSCs/Sucnr�/�NSCs/hiNSCs were kept in an Eppendorf tube at 37�C ±
the irreversible blocker of COX2 SC-58125 (10 mM, Sigma-Aldrich), the specific inhibitor of human SUCNR1 4c (1 mM, Advinus
Therapeutics), or PBS (control) for 1 hr prior co-cultures. Cells were then spun at 400 g for 5 min, washed with PBS and re-suspended
in M4 medium. Co-cultures of M4 and treatment cells were all started 1 hr after LPS stimulation using 0.4 mm-pore size trans-well
inserts (Millipore) at a 1:1 ratio. 24 hr after the start of the co-cultures, inserts were removed and M4/culture media were isolated for
subsequent analysis.
After BV2 cell line reached �70% confluence, cells were collected and re-seeded at a density of 1x105 cells/3.7 cm2 on 12 well
plates in BV2 experiment medium [DMEM high glucose (GIBCO), 1% pen/strep (Invitrogen)] to avoid excessive activation. After
12 hr from re-seeding 50 ng/ml LPS (Enzo) was added to the medium for stimulation. For co-culture experiments, treatment cells
were dissociated, counted and re-suspended in BV2 experiment medium. Co-cultures of BV2 and treatment cells were all started
Cell Stem Cell 22, 355–368.e1–e13, March 1, 2018
e7
 1 hr after LPS stimulation using 0.4 mm-pore size trans-well inserts (Millipore) at a 1:1 ratio. 6 hr after the start of the co-cultures,
inserts were removed and BV2 were isolated for subsequent analysis.
Recombinant SDHA activity and treatment of type-1 inflammatory M4
Mouse recombinant succinate dehydrogenase complex subunit A (rSDHA) was purchased from Cloud-Clone Corp. (RPJ784Mu01),
reconstituted on ddH20 and kept at �80�C (stock solution 0.1 mg/ml). Activity measurements were performed using a SDH Activity
Colorimetric Assay Kit (#K660-100, BioVision) following manufacturer’s instructions. For mouse rSDHA treatment, M4LPS were
activated as described and rSDHA was added to the M4 medium (0.05 mg/ml) 1 hr after LPS stimulation. After 24 hr M4 were isolated
for subsequent gene expression analysis.
Lentiviral fGFP tagging
Cells used for transplantation studies were transduced in vitro using a third-generation lentiviral carrier (pRRLsinPPT-hCMV) coding
for the enhanced farnesylated (f)GFP, which targets the fluorescent protein to the inner plasma membrane of transduced cells
(Cusimano et al., 2012). The functional stability of these cells (in the absence or in the presence of the lentiviral transcript) has
been confirmed with clonal and population studies (Pluchino et al., 2003). Briefly, neurospheres were harvested, dissociated to a
single cell suspension and seeded at high density [1.5x106 in a T75 cm2 flask (Sigma-Aldrich)] in 5 mL fresh medium. After 12 hr,
3x106 T.U./ml of lentiviral vectors were added and 6 hr later additional 5 mL of fresh medium were added. 72 hr after viral transduc-
tion, cells were harvested and re-seeded at normal concentration. Transgene expression was measured by FACS analysis before
transplantation and > 98% of cells were found to be labeled.
EAE induction, transplantation and behavioral studies
For EAE induction, mice were anaesthetized with isoflurane (4% induction, 1.5% maintenance), and received n = 3 subcutaneous
(s.c.) injections (2 flanks and 1 at the base of the tail) of 50 mL containing 200 mg/mouse MOG35-55 (Multiple Peptide System)
(Espikem), incomplete Freund’s Adjuvant (IFA) and 8 mg/ml Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Scientific Laboratories Supply). 100 mL
of Pertussis Toxin (5 ng/ml) (List Biological Laboratories) was injected intravenously (i.v.) on the day of the immunization and again
after 48 hr.
Body weight and EAE clinical score (0 = healthy; 1 = limp tail; 2 = ataxia and/or paresis of hindlimbs; 3 = paralysis of hindlimbs
and/or paresis of forelimbs; 4 = tetraparalysis; 5 = moribund or death) were recorded daily (Pluchino et al., 2003).
After 11-19 days post immunisation (dpi), mice developed the first clinical signs of diseases (disease onset). At 3 days after disease
onset, mice with similar scores were randomly assigned to the different treatment groups. After randomization, mice received a single
intracerebroventricular (icv) injection (AP �0.15, ML +1.0 left, DV �2.4) of fGFP+ NSCs, or fGFP+ iNSCs or fGFP+ Sucnr1�/� NSCs
(1x106 in 5 mL PBS). EAE mice untreated or transplanted icv with 1x106 MFs or injected icv with 5 mL PBS were used as controls.
Body weight and EAE clinical score were recorded daily up to 50 dpi or 110 dpi. Data were expressed as the mean of EAE score
(±SEM) from a total of n R 6 mice per group per time point.
Gait kinematics was assessed using a DigiGaitTM (Mouse Specifics Inc., Boston, MA) ventral plane treadmill videography before
EAE onset (baseline) and at 10-30 days post transplantation (dpt), as previously described (Eftaxiopoulou et al., 2014). Briefly, the
treadmill speed was set at either 10 or 5 cm/sec (depending on each mouse fitness), and the gait of the mice was recorded. An analyz-
able run was defined as a 5 s video segment without wall or bumper contacts. The mouse was designated as noncompliant and the
test was stopped if the mouse failed to accomplish an analyzable run after 3 trials (a 30 s rest was allowed between trials). Criteria for
test failure where (i) at least 2 min of test without capturing an analyzable run, and/or (ii) the mouse could not run without contacting
the rear wall of the enclosure.
Ex vivo tissue pathology
All pathological quantifications were performed by investigators blind to the treatment groups. The day of sacrifice, mice were deeply
anesthetized with an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of ketamine 10 mg/ml (Boehringer Ingelheim) and xylazine 1.17 mg/ml (Bayer) in
sterile water and transcardially perfused with 1ml EDTA 5M in 500ml saline 0.9% NaCl for 5 min, followed by a solution of 4% PFA in
PBS for another 5 min.
Brains and spinal cords were isolated and post-fixed in 4% PFA in PBS at 4�C overnight. Tissues were then washed in PBS and left
for at least 48-72 hr in 30% sucrose in PBS at 4�C for cryo-protection. Brains and spinal cords were then embedded in optimum cut-
ting temperature (OCT) medium, frozen with liquid nitrogen and cryo-sectioned (25 mm coronal section thickness for brains and 10 mm
axial section thickness for spinal cords) using a cryostat (CM1850, Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) with a microtome blade (A35, Feather,
Osaka, Japan). Sections were then stored at �80�C until use.
For quantification of graft survival and inflammatory infiltrates, sections were pre-treated with peroxidase 3% for 15 min, and then
were incubated in the blocking solution [PBS + 10% normal goat serum (NGS, Sigma-Aldrich) ± 0.1% Triton X-100] for 1 hr at RT.
Primary antibodies were diluted in a solution of PBS + 1% NGS ± 0.1% Triton X-100, and incubated at 4�C overnight. The following
primary antibodies were used: anti-GFP (1:250, Invitrogen), anti-CD45 (1:100, Serotec), anti-F4/80 (1:100, Serotec), anti-CD3 (1:250,
Abcam), anti-CD20 (1:100, Santa Cruz). The following day, tissues were washed with PBS and incubated for 1 hr with the appropriate
secondary biotinilated antibody (1:500, Sigma-Aldrich) diluted in a solution of PBS + 1% NGS, ± 0.1% Triton X-100. Components ‘‘A’’
and ‘‘B’’ of Vectastain Elite ABC kit were mixed for 45 min and the reaction developed by means of 3,30-Diaminobenzidine (DAB) as
e8

 per manufacturer’s instructions. The reaction was blocked dipping the section into distilled water and sections were counterstained
with hematoxylin. The tissues were then dehydrated (with increasing alcohol solutions), washed in xylene (Merck, Darnstadt,
Germany) and mounted with a synthetic mounting medium (EUKITT, Hatfield, PA, USA). The numbers of transplanted fGFP+ cells
and the areas of CD45+/F4/80+/CD3+/CD20+ inflammatory infiltrates were calculated on n = 10 equally spaced sections axial brain
sections and n = 15 equally spaced axial spinal cord sections. fGFP+ cells and inflammatory contours were outlined using an
Olympus BX53 microscope with motorized stage and Neurolucida software (11.07 64-bit, Microbrightfield) and descriptive 3D
brain/spinal cord reconstructions were obtained.
For quantification of demyelination and axonal damage, cryostat 10 mm thick spinal cord sections were stained for Luxol fast blue
(LFB)/periodic-acid Schiff and Bielschowsky silver impregnation respectively, as previously described (Pluchino et al., 2003). The
LFB/Bielschowsky negative areas of n = 15 equally spaced axial spinal cord sections were outlined using an Olympus BX53 micro-
scope with motorized stage and Neurolucida software (11.07 64-bit, Microbrightfield) and descriptive 3D spinal cord reconstructions
were obtained. Data are expressed as the percentage (%) of damaged tissue per section (±SEM).
For the quantification of stem cell differentiation and of the % of MPs expressing pro/anti-inflammatory markers in vivo, sections
were rinsed with PBS, and then blocked for 1 hr at RT in blocking buffer (0.1% Triton X-100 and 10% secondary antibody species
serum in PBS). A Fab fragment affinity purified IgG anti-mouse was applied if anti-mouse antibodies were used (1:10, Jackson
ImmunoResearch). The following primary antibodies, diluted in blocking buffer, were used at 4�C overnight: anti-GFP (1:250, Invitro-
gen), anti-nestin (1:200, Abcam), anti-Ki67 (1:250, Abcam), anti-GFAP (1:500, Abcam), anti-NeuN (1:250, Chemicon), anti-
MBP (1:100, AbD SeroTec), anti-OLIG2 (1:500, Millipore), anti-von willebrand factor (vWF) (1:200 Abcam), anti-doublecortin (DCX)
(1:250, Abcam), anti-fibronectin (1:400, Sigma-Aldrich), anti-CD31 (1:20, BD PharMingen), anti-F4/80 (1:100 Serotec), anti-iNOS
(1:100, BD Bioscience), anti-MRC1 (1:400, Abcam). Sections were then washed in PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100 and incubated
with the appropriate fluorescent secondary antibodies (1:1,000 Alexa Fluor 405, 488, 555, 647, Invitrogen) for 1 hr at RT. After
washing in PBS, nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (1:10,000, Invitrogen) for 3 min and then mounted with Dako mounting kit
(Fluka). Nonspecific staining was observed in control incubations in which the primary antibodies were omitted.
Quantification of graft differentiation was obtained from randomized n R 3 brain ROIs and n R 5 brain spinal cord ROIs acquired
using a confocal microscope (Leica TCS SP5 Microscope). Data are expressed as % of double positive cells over total fGFP+ cells
(±SEM) (R95 fGFP+ cells for each marker of interest were counted). Quantification of MPs expressing pro/anti-inflammatory markers
was obtained from the brain (n R 25 randomized ROIs) and the spinal cords (n = 6 equally spaced entire sections) of EAE mice using a
fluorescence microscope (Leica DFC 3000G). Data are expressed as % of double positive area over total F4/80+ area (±SEM).
Blood brain barrier functional analysis
Blood brain barrier (BBB) functional analysis in EAE mice was performed at 30 dpt, as it follows. Briefly, 2% Evans blue dye (EBD,
Sigma Aldrich) in physiological saline solution was administered at a dose of 5 mL per g body weight through the tail vein and allowed
to circulate for 1 hr. Mice were then deeply anesthetized, perfused with saline-EDTA and the brains snap frozen on dry ice. Brains
were cryo-sectioned (25 mm coronal section thickness) using a cryostat (CM1850, Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) with a microtome blade
(A35, Feather, Osaka, Japan). Sections were then stored at �80�C until use. To analyze the peri-vascular BBB permeability, sections
were fixed in 4% PFA for 15min at RT, washed twice in distilled deionized water and blocked for 1h at RT in blocking solution (0.3%
Triton X-100 and 10% goat serum in PBS). Anti-CD31 antibody (1:20, BD PharMingen) was diluted in a solution of PBS + 1% NGS ±
0.3% Triton X-100, and incubated at 4�C overnight. The following day, sections were washed with PBS and incubated for 1h with the
appropriate secondary antibody diluted in a solution of PBS + 1% NGS, ± 0.3% Triton X-100 (1:1000, Alexa Fluor 488, Invitrogen).
After washing in PBS, nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (1:10,000, Invitrogen) for 3 min and mounted with Dako mounting kit
(Fluka). EBD fluorescence intensity (excitation at 620 nm, emission at 680 nm) was calculated on constant ROI areas within the brain
(n = 3 mice per group, n R 13 ROI areas per mouse) using ImageJ software.
Quantification of BBB permeability on brain samples was performed as previously described (Wang and Lai, 2014). Briefly, 50 mg
of brain slices were incubated in 500 mL of 0.9% saline for 60 min and centrifuged at 10,000 g for 10 min. Supernatants were treated
with 1:1 volume-ratio of 50% TCA and centrifuged at 10,000 g for 20 min. Samples were diluted 1:3 with 95% ethanol and absorbance
were read at 620 nm. Data are expressed as mg of EBD per g of tissue (±SEM).
Plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sampling
For plasma sampling (at 10 and 30 dpt), the tail vein was punctured and whole blood was sucked by capillarity in EDTA filled
Microvettes (Sarstedt) (10-30 ml/mouse). Samples were kept at 4�C until centrifugation (950 g for 5 min). Plasma was then collected
from supernatant and stored at �80�C for subsequent analysis.
For CSF sampling (at 10 and 30 dpt), mice were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane (4% induction, 1.5% maintenance), and CSF
(3-5 ml/mouse) was obtained as part of a terminal procedure from the cisterna magna, as previously described (Liu and Duff, 2008).
CSF samples were initially put on dry ice and then stored at �80�C for subsequent analysis.
Calcium imaging
Cells were counted after dissociation and seeded in their own specific medium plus laminin (Roche) 1:100 (laminin was not added for
MFs) on 35 mm glass bottom culture dishes (MatTek Corporation) (1.5x105 cells/dish). After 2 days in culture, media was changed
with Tyrode’s solution (isotonic solution resembling CSF composition and containing 129 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 3 mM
Cell Stem Cell 22, 355–368.e1–e13, March 1, 2018
e9
 MgCl2, 30 mM Glucose, 25 mM HEPES) with 5 mM Fluo-4AM (Life Technologies) for 30 min at 37�C. Cells were then washed twice
(15 min) with fresh Tyrode’s solution. The dish was then mounted in a home-made microfluidic chamber and put on the stage of a
Leica DMI 6000B inverted live imaging microscope in a controlled humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37�C. The chamber was
connected to a perfusion system to allow a continuous/regular flow of solutions and stimulation with 500 mM succinate dibasic
hexa-hydrate (Sigma-Aldrich), 1 mM monosodium glutamate (Sigma-Aldrich) or 1 mM ATP (Sigma-Aldrich) and 10 mM Thapsigargin
(Sigma-Aldrich), when necessary.
Cells were recorded for 200 s: 50 s of baseline, 100 s of stimulus and 50-180 s of recovery. Images were acquired with a frequency
of 2 frames per sec (fps) using a live cell imaging fluorescence microscope. For quantification, acquired time-lapses were analyzed
using ImageJ software. The changes of fluorescence intensity overtime of individual ROIs corresponding to the soma of each cell
were quantified and normalized over the background fluorescence. The mean intensity of 10 s (corresponding to 20 fps) of basal
recording was considered as F0. Changes in fluorescence intensity are expressed as DF/F0, where DF = Fi-F0 and Fi is the fluores-
cence intensity of a ROI at a given time point. Signal quantifications were averaged on the top 25 most responsive cells. Percentage of
responsive cells was calculated as % of cells showing a DF/F0 R 0.07. Representative pictures of baseline and succinate iNSCs/
NSCs/MFs and SUCNR NSCs were pseudolored applying an RGB color model assigning red (RGB: 255, 0, 0) or violet (RGB: 68,
0, 96) according to high or low fluorescence intensities.
ELISA
For measurements of prostaglandin (PG) E2 levels after succinate stimulation, cells were dissociated, counted, and
5x105 cells/500 ml/well per condition were seeded in a 24 well plate. After 6 hr, sodium succinate dibasic hexa-hydrate (500 mM,
Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS (or PBS alone) was added to the wells. Cells pre-treated (1 hr before succinate stimulus) with ± SC-58125
(10 mM, Sigma-Aldrich) or ± 4c (1 mM, Advinus Therapeutics) were used as controls. After 30 min from succinate stimulation, media
were collected, spun at 1,000 g for 5 min, and supernatants stored at �80�C for subsequent analysis.
For measurements of PGE2 levels after co-cultures, media were collected at 24 hr of co-culture spun at 1,000 g for 5 min, and
supernatants were stored at �80�C for subsequent analysis.
For ex vivo measurements of PGE2 levels in CSF, frozen samples were thawed on ice and n R 2 samples from EAE mice were
pulled together. For ex vivo measurements of PGE2 levels in plasma, frozen samples were thawed on ice (n = 1 sample from
each EAE mouse). Samples were then diluted in ice-cold ELISA buffer (1:10) and analyzed the same day.
All PGE2 levels were determined using PGE2 ELISA kit (Caymanchem) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 50 mL of
samples were added to 96 wells pre-coated plates and incubated for 18 hr at 4�C. Plates were then washed, developed for 60-90 min
at RT, and read at 405-420 nm. PGE2 concentration was determined by comparison to the standard curve performing 4-parameter
logistic fit.
Uptake experiments with [14C] - labeled succinate
Cells were counted after dissociation and re-plated at high cell-density (2.4x105 cells/cm2) the day before the experiment.
The following day cells were collected and centrifuged at 300 g for 8 min. Pellet was re-suspended in CGM or iNSCs medium
(previously adjusted at pH 6.8) and cells were seeded in a 6 well plate at a final concentration of 5x105 cells/ml/well. Each well
was respectively stimulated with [14C] - labeled succinate (American Radiolabelled Chemicals) at final concentration 500 mM
(80 nCi [14C] - succinate/mL) in PBS. PBS alone was used as controls. At the corresponding time points, culture media and cells
were collected, and centrifuged at 400 g for 5 min. To isolate the extracellular fraction, 500 mL of supernatant from each sample
was added to tubes containing 3 mL of Ultima Gold liquid scintillation cocktail (PerkinElmer). To isolate the cellular fraction, the
remaining volume in the tube was removed first after a 1,000 g for 5 min spin. Another 1,000 g for 1 min spin was then performed
to better separate the pellet from the residual supernatant. Finally, each pellet was dried with blotting paper (to further avoid any
extracellular fraction’s contamination) and 40 mL of Triton X-100 was added. Cellular fraction was then added to tubes containing
3 mL Ultima Gold liquid scintillation cocktail (PerkinElmer). Total radioactivity was then measured using a TriCarb LSC Counter
(PerkinElmer). Radioactive counts were converted into decays per min and subsequently converted into amounts of succinate using
a final specific activity of 0.15 mCi/mmol. Data were normalized on total proteins content evaluated by BCA Protein assay kit (Thermo
Scientific).
Immunoblotting
Western blots for SUCNR1 were performed on freshly dissociated cells. Cells were collected and spun at 16,000 g for 30 s. Pellets
were washed with PBS, and then re-suspended in 50 mL of 1X RIPA buffer (Abcam) with protease (Roche) and phosphatase inhibitors
(Thermo Fisher Scientific). Samples were frozen at �80�C until further use.
Western blots after succinate stimulation were performed as it follows. Cells were dissociated, counted, and 1.5x106 cells/1ml/well
per condition were seeded in a 6 well plate. After 6 hr, either sodium succinate dibasic hexa-hydrate (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS (final
concentration 500 mM, unless otherwise stated) or PBS alone (control) was added to each well. Cells pre-treated (1 hr before
succinate stimulus) with ± 4c (1 mM, Advinus Therapeutics) were used as controls for hiNSCs studies. After given time points
(0min-5min-10min-15min-2hr-6hrs) cells were collected and spun at 16,000 g for 30 s. Pellets were washed with PBS, and then
re-suspended in 50 mL (or 25 mL for pP38/P38 WB) of 1X RIPA buffer (Abcam) (with protease/phosphatase inhibitors). Samples
were frozen at �80�C and electrophoresis was performed the following day.

Cell Stem Cell 22, 355–368.e1–e13, March 1, 2018
 Western blots for IL-1b on M4 were performed after 24 hr of co-culture. Proteins were extracted by pooling 3 wells of a 12 well plate
per condition (3x105 cells in total). First, cells were washed with PBS, and then 1X RIPA buffer (Abcam) with protease (Roche) and
phosphatase inhibitors (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added to each well (30 ml/well). Cells were frozen at �20�C for 1 hr, and then
scraped before pooling. Samples were frozen at �80�C and electrophoresis was performed the following day.
Western blots for Hif-1a/PKM2 on M4 were performed after 24 hr of co-culture. Proteins were extracted by pooling 6 wells of a 12
well plate (6x105 cells in total) per condition. First, cells were washed with PBS, and then Laemmli buffer (Sigma-Aldrich) 1X final
concentration with protease (Roche) and phosphatase inhibitors (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added to each well (50 ml/well). Cells
were scraped before pooling, samples were heated 95�C for 5 mins, and the same volume of extract (25 ml) was loaded for electro-
phoresis on the same day on a 10% Bis-Tris precasted gel (Life technologies).
For all the other samples (i.e., those stored at �80�C), extracts were instead defrosted, sonicated and proteins were quantified
using Pierce BCA Protein Assay kit (Thermo scientific). These samples were then heated at 95�C for 5 mins, and the same amount
of protein (50-60 mg of extract for P-p38/p38 or 10-20 mg of extract for all the other targets) per each condition was loaded with
1X NuPAGE LDS sample buffer and NuPAGE sample reducing agent 1X on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel.
After running at 120V, samples were then transferred on Immobilon PVDF filter paper sandwich at run completion (Millipore). The
membrane was then blocked with 5% non-fat milk in 0.1% PBS-Tween 20 for 1 hr and then incubated with primary antibodies diluted
in 5% non-fat milk in 0.1% PBS-Tween 20 [with phosphatase inhibitors (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in case of P-p38/p38 WB] overnight
at 4�C.
The following primary antibodies were used for immunoblotting: anti-HiF1a (1:1,000, Novus Biologicals), anti-PKM2 (1:1,000 Cell
Signaling), anti-IL-1b (1:1,000 R&D systems), anti-SUCNR1 (1:500 Novus Biologicals), anti-P-p38 MAPK (1:1,000 Cell Signaling),
anti-p38 MAPK (1:1,000 Cell Signaling), anti-SLC13A5 (1:400 ThermoFisher), anti-SLC13A3 (1:1,000 Aviva Systems Biology), anti-
b-actin (1:10,000 Sigma-Aldrich), anti-b-tubulin (1:1,000 Sigma-Aldrich). After 3 washes in 0.1% PBS-Tween 20, membranes were
incubated for 1 hr at RT with the appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies: anti-rabbit HRP conjugated secondary
(1:10,000 Thermo Scientific), anti-mouse HRP conjugated secondary (1:20,000 Thermo Scientific). Proteins bands were developed
using Enhanced Chemiluminescence Substrate (Perkin Elmer) and acquired using a Biorad Chemidoc MP system. The density of
each band was quantified using ImageJ software and normalized to housekeeping bands (b-actin or b-tubulin) measured in the
same membranes.
Extracellular flux (XF) assays
A XF24e Extracellular Flux Analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience, Billerica, MA) was used for all XF assays.
For XF assay on M4 co-cultures, M4 were seeded 6 days after bone marrow isolation, with fresh M4 medium on a 24 well XF24 cell
culture microplate (1x105 cells/well) for co-culture experiments. After approximately 18 hr from seeding, M4 were stimulated by
adding 50 ng/ml LPS (Enzo life sciences). Treatment (or control) cells were added at 1:1 ratio, 1 hr after LPS stimulation, using
0.4 mm-pore size trans-well inserts (24 well-size, Millipore). 24 hr after the start of the co-culture the inserts were removed, M4
medium was replaced with XF medium [Seahorse salt solution (Seahorse Bioscience), 1% glutamine 200 mM, 1% pyruvate
100 mM, 1% FBS, D-glucose (225 mg/50ml final volume)] pH 7.35-7.45, and baseline oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracel-
lular acidification rate (ECAR) were measured for 10 reads.
For XF assay on all other cell types, cells were counted after dissociation and seeded in their own specific medium plus
laminin (Roche) 1:100 (laminin was not added for MFs) on a 24 well XF24 cell culture microplate (1x105 cells/well). When cells
reached > 90% confluency, media were replaced with XF medium pH 7.35-7.45. Mitochondrial stress protocol was performed using
oligomycin, FCCP, rotenone and antimycin (1 mM final concentration).
After the completion of each XF assay, cells were washed with PBS and 25 mL of 1X RIPA buffer (with protease/phosphatase
inhibitors) were added to each well. The total protein amount/well was estimated with a BCA Protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific)
and used to normalize the OCR and ECAR values of the single well.
Gene expression analysis (microarrays and qRT-PCR)
Ex vivo samples were collected at 10 and 30 dpt. Mice were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane (4% induction) and decapitated. The
entire brain and spinal cord were exposed, isolated and stored in RNAlater (QIAGEN) at 4�C until use. Samples were homogenated
using a potter and total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Plus Universal Midi Kit (QIAGEN) following manufacturer’s instructions.
Total RNA from M4 or BV2 microglial cell line in co-cultures was collected at given time points. Before collection, cells were
washed with PBS, 350 mL of RLT buffer were added, and samples stored at �80�C until extraction.
Total RNA after succinate stimulation was collected as it follows. Cells were dissociated, counted, and 1.5x106 cells/ml/well per
condition were seeded in a 6 well plate. After 6 hr, sodium succinate dibasic hexa-hydrate (500 mM, Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS or PBS
alone (control) was added to each well. After 15 min cells were collected and spun at 16,000 g for 30 s. Pellets were washed with PBS,
resuspended in 350 mL of RLT buffer and stored at �80�C until extraction.
Total RNA from all in vitro samples was extracted using the RNeasy Micro Kit (QIAGEN) following manufacturer’s instructions.
For microarrays, samples were prepared according to Affymetrix protocols (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). RNA quality and quantity
were ensured using the Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) and NanoDrop (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) respectively. For RNA
labeling, 200 ng of total RNA was used in conjunction with the Affymetrix recommended protocol for the Clariom_S chips. The hy-
bridization cocktail containing the fragmented and labeled cDNAs was hybridized to the Affymetrix Mouse Clariom_S GeneChip. The
Cell Stem Cell 22, 355–368.e1–e13, March 1, 2018
e11
 chips were washed and stained by the Affymetrix Fluidics Station using the standard format and protocols as described by Affyme-
trix. The probe arrays were stained with streptavidin phycoerythrin solution (Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA) and enhanced by using
an antibody solution containing 0.5 mg/mL of biotinylated anti-streptavidin (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). An Affymetrix
Gene Chip Scanner 3000 was used to scan the probe arrays. Gene expression intensities were calculated using Affymetrix AGCC
software. Downstream analysis was conducted in R/Bioconductor.
The annotation package for the Clariom_S chips was generated with pdInfoBuilder (https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/
release/bioc/html/pdInfoBuilder.html) using the platform files provided by Affymetrix. The CEL files were then loaded into R, RMA
normalized with the oligo package, and filtered to only retain probes annotated as ‘‘main’’ (Carvalho and Irizarry, 2010). Differential
expression testing was performed using limma (Ritchie et al., 2015) and the resulting p.values were corrected with the Benjamini-
Hochberg method.
GO enrichment analyses were performed using the topGO package (https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/
topGO.html) with the classic algorithm and Fisher statistic. Microarray heatmaps were generated with the heatmap.2 function of
the gplots package with the default clustering methods. The microarray raw data were deposited in ArrayExpress with the accession
numbers E-MTAB-5579 and E-MTAB-5586.
For qRT-PCR analysis, equal amounts of RNA were reversed-transcribed using the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription
Kit (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA was then quantified with the NanoDrop 2000c
instrument (Thermo Scientific) and qRT-PCR was performed with the TaqMan� Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems)
and TaqMan� Gene Expression Assays for: Il12b (Mm01288989_m1, Life Technologies), Il15 (Mm00434210_m1, Life Technologies),
Il15ra (Mm04336046_m1, Life Technologies), Cd69 (Mm01183378_m1, Life Technologies), Nos2 (Mm00440502_m1, Life Technolo-
gies), Tnf (Mm00443258_m1, Life Technologies), Il1b (Mm00434228_m1, Life Technologies), Bst1 (Mm00477672_m1, Life Technol-
ogies), Ust (Mm00616790_m1, Life Technologies) Arg1 (Mm00475988_m1, Life Technologies), Mrc1 (Mm00485148_m1, Life

SUCNR1
(Hs00908230_m1,
Life
Technologies),
Ptgs2
(Mm00478374_m1, Life Technologies), and Actb/18S (Life Technologies) were used as internal calibrators. All samples were tested
in triplicate on a 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) and analyzed with the 2-DDCT method.
Metabolite extraction and LC-MS analysis
Ex vivo CSF/plasma samples (stored at �80�C) were thawed on ice for metabolites extraction. Samples were diluted in cold methanol
(1:10) and put in agitation for 15 min at 4�C (800 rpm). After a centrifugation (20,000 g for 10 min), the supernatants were transferred to
a new pre-chilled Eppendorf tube. Samples were concentrated using a SpeedVac (ThermoScientific Savant DNA 120) for 15 min and
the pellet was dissolved in cold acetonitrile/water (1:1) using 16X of the initial sample volume. Samples were transferred to pre-chilled
autosampler vials (Thermo Fisher) and stored at �80�C for subsequent liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry
(LC-MS) analysis.
In vitro samples were collected from M4 (INTRA_Metab) and cell culture media (EXTRA_Metab). INTRA_Metab were collected from
M4 at 1-2-4-6-8-12-25 hr upon LPS stimulation and at 24 hr after the start of co-cultures (for co-culture experiments). For INTRA_
Metab extraction, M4 (originally re-seeded as 1x105 cells/well in a 12 well plate) were washed with PBS and kept on ice throughout
the procedure. 200 mL of Metabolite Extraction Buffer (MEB) (50% Methanol, 30% Acetonitrile, 20% water, with 100 ng/mL HEPES)
was added to each well, and after scraping, extracts from each single well were collected separately. Samples were kept in agitation
at 4�C (800 rpm) for 15 min, and then spun at 13,000 g for 15 min at 4�C. 100 mL of the supernatant was transferred to a pre-chilled
autosampler vial and stored at �80�C for subsequent LC-MS analysis. EXTRA_Metab were collected from M4 media at 25 hr from
LPS stimulation and at 24 hr after the start of co-cultures (for co-culture experiments). For EXTRA_Metab extraction, media were
collected from M4, spun at 1,000 g for 5 min, and 50 mL of the supernatant transferred to a pre-chilled Eppendorf containing
750 mL of MEB. Samples were kept in agitation at 4�C (800 rpm) for 15 min, and then spun at 1,000 g for 10 min at 4�C. 600 mL of
the supernatant was transferred to a pre-chilled autosampler vial and stored at �80�C for subsequent LC-MS analysis.
LC-MS analysis was performed on a QExactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer coupled to a Dionex U3000 UHPLC system (Thermo).
The liquid chromatography system was fitted with a Sequant ZIC-HILIC column (150 mm x 2.1 mm, 5 mm) and guard column
(20 mm 3 2.1 mm, 5 mm) from HiChrom, Reading, UK. The mobile phase was composed of 0.1% formic acid (v/v) in water
(solvent A), and 0.1% formic acid (v/v) in acetonitrile (solvent B). The flow rate was set at 300 mL/min with the following gradient:
0 min 80% B, 5 min 30% B, 15 min 10% B, 20 min 10% B, 21 min 80% B, 30 min 80% B. The mass spectrometer was operated
in full MS and polarity switching mode. Samples were randomized in order to avoid bias due to machine drift. The acquired spectra
were analyzed using XCalibur Qual Browser and XCalibur Quan Browser software (Thermo Scientific) by referencing to an internal
library of compounds.
QUANTITATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSES
Statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism (version 5.00 for Mac, GraphPad Software), unless otherwise stated.
Statistical analyses of EAE score and mitochondrial stress protocol were performed using a two-way ANOVA analysis, followed
by Holm-Sidak post-test. Statistical analysis of DigiGait data was performed with SPSS (version 21 for mac, IBM Software) and out-
comes were analyzed using a multivariate general linear model. Metabolic changes were analyzed using a one-way ANOVA, followed
by Bonferroni post-test, unless otherwise stated. All remaining differences among groups were tested using a Kruskal-Wallis test,

 followed by a Mann-Whitney post-test. Information on number of subjects and experimental replicates are given in the figure legends
of the corresponding experiments.
All values are given in the text as mean (±SEM) and a p value < 0.05 was accepted as significant in all analyses, unless otherwise
stated.
