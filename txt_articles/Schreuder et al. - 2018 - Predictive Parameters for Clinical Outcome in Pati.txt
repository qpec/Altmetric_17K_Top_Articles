Abstract
Purpose To identify possible risk factors in predicting
clinical outcome in critical limb ischemia (CLI) patients
undergoing percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA).
Materials and Methods PubMed and EMBASE were
searched for studies analyzing CLI and clinical outcome
after PTA from January 2006 to April 2017. Outcome
measures were ulcer healing, amputation free survival
(AFS)/limb salvage and overall survival. Data on predic-
tive factors for ulcer healing, AFS/limb salvage and sur-
vival were extracted.
Results Ten articles with a total of 2448 patients were
included, all cohorts and based on prospective-designed
databases. For ulcers, it seems that complete healing can be
achieved in most of the patients within 1 year. No signif-
icant predictive factors were found. AFS/limb salvage:
AFS rates for 1, 2 and 3 years ranged from 49.5 to 75.2%,
37 to 58% and 22 to 59%, respectively. Limb salvage rates
for 1, 2 and 3 years ranged from 71 to 95%, 54 to 93.3%
and 32 to 92.7%, respectively. All studies had different
univariate and multivariate outcomes for predictive factors;
however, age and diabetes were significant predictors in at
least three studies. Survival: Survival rates for 1, 2 and
3 years ranged from 65.4 to 91.5%, 45.7 to 76% and 37.3
to 83.1%, respectively. Different predictive factors were
found; however, age was found in 2 out of 5 studies
reporting on predictive factors.
Conclusions In several studies two factors, age and dia-
betes, were found as predictive factors for AFS/limb sal-
vage and survival in patients with CLI undergoing PTA.
Therefore, we believe that these factors should be taken
into account in future research.

Introduction
Critical limb ischemia (CLI) due to peripheral arterial
disease is a condition in which the lower extremity is
threatened and is defined by ischemic rest pain, with or
without ischemic tissue loss [1]. CLI has a great impact on
healthcare and associated healthcare budget [2]. A number
of risk factors are known to be associated with the devel-
opment of CLI, which are diabetes mellitus, smoking,
increased age, lipid abnormalities and low ankle-brachial
pressure index [2].
Of the CLI patients, 10–40% will lose their leg within
6 months and the 1-year mortality rate is 25% in CLI
patients who are not able to be revascularized [2–4].
Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA), with or
without stenting, is an alternative approach to surgical bypass
as a revascularization method in patients with CLI [5, 6].
Compared to surgery, it involves advantages such as minimal
access trauma and shorter hospital stay. Therefore, PTA is
more suited and often suggested as first-line therapy for high-
risk CLI patients with a lower life expectancy [7–10].
To identify the effect of PTA, clinical outcomes such as
wound healing, amputation free survival (AFS) and sur-
vival during follow-up are recorded and presented [11–17].

 However, interpreting these clinical outcomes in this
patient group is difficult, because of its heterogeneity in the
risk factors such as comorbid diabetes, difference in age,
renal failure or lifestyle factors such as smoking and obe-
sity. We often see a discrepancy between a good revas-
cularization result of the PTA, identified on digital
subtraction angiography (DSA) and an unexpected poor
clinical outcome with early amputation [9, 18, 19]. For
future analysis of study results concerning endovascular
treatment in CLI patients, it is important to identity which
risk factors are associated with poor outcome.
Therefore, the aim of this systematic review was to
identify risk factors in predicting poor clinical outcome in
patients with CLI undergoing PTA with or without stenting.
Drug eluting technologies were not included in the review to
try to maintain homogeneity in the study population.
Materials and Methods
This review was conducted according to the preferred
reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis
(PRISMA) guidelines [20]. The review protocol was not
published or registered in advance.
Search Strategy
An electronic search was performed in the databases
PubMed and EMBASE for studies analyzing CLI and
clinical outcome after percutaneous revascularization. The
search period was from January 2006 to April 2017. Search
terms used for PubMed and EMBASE are listed below.
PubMed ‘‘Critical limb ischemia OR critical limb
ischemia AND (angioplasty OR endovascular revascular-
ization OR percutaneous intentional extraluminal revas-
cularization OR subintimal OR endovascular therapy)

OR survival) AND Humans’’.
Embase: (Critical limb ischamia OR critical limb

Study Selection
Step 1
All retrieved articles were checked on title and
abstract
by
one
observer
(X2).
Duplicates,
reviews,
guidelines, comments, letters to the editor, conferences,
case reports, study protocol and articles not containing CLI
were excluded.
Step 2
All remaining articles were also checked on
abstract by the same observer (X2). When studies con-
tained less than fifty patients, patients did not receive PTA,
the study was retrospective (we considered prospective
database as prospective study) or the follow-up period was
less than 1 year, these studies were excluded. To avoid
exclusion of relevant articles, ambiguous articles were
retrieved as full text and treated as potentially eligible
articles. The observer double-checked step 2 and was not
blinded to author and journal names.
Inclusion of Relevant Articles
Three observers (X1, X2 and X3) independently checked
all remaining articles for inclusion and exclusion criteria.
Two observers (X1 and X2) each checked half of the rel-
evant articles, and the findings were discussed with
observer 3 (X3) who has experience on data extraction of
25 meta-analyses.
The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) prospective
study or prospective database (we considered prospective
database as prospective study, hospital billing and other
registries as retrospective); (2) patients with CLI as defined
by Fontaine class III–IV or Rutherford class IV–VI (rest
pain, non-healing ulcer or gangrene); (3) patients under-
went (regular) PTA (no drug eluting stents); (4) [
50
patients with CLI undergoing PTA; (5) data on outcome
were available for at least 1 year of follow-up (outcomes
were healing, AFS (major of minor) and overall survival);
(6) separate data on CLI and PTA were available (in
studies that included a variety of patients or treatments, for
example data on CLI patient who underwent PTA or
bypass surgery); and (7) finally, data on predictive factors
were reported. Exclusion criterion was duplicate data.
Data Extraction
Two
reviewers
(X1,
radiologist
with
experience
in
extracting data of two reviews and X2, medical student)
used a standardized form to extract data independently on
study design characteristics, patient selection, baseline
patient characteristics, procedure description, angiographic
outcomes
and
complications,
follow-up
and
dropout
patients, clinical outcomes and predictive factors. Again,
each observer extracted data of half of the articles and were
double-checked by the third reviewer with experience on
data extraction of 25 meta-analyses.
Study design characteristics The following data on
study design characteristics were extracted: (1) study type
(cohort, part of RCT or other); (2) study design (single
center or multicenter and prospective study or prospective
database retrospectively analyzed); (3) setting initiation
institute (academic, tertiary or other); (4) department

 initiation by first author (radiology, surgery or other); (5)
period of recruitment; (6) institutional review board
approval (approved and informed consent obtained/waived,
not approved or unclear); and (7) funding or a potential role
of funders in the study (conflict of interest).
Patient selection The following data on patient selection
were retrieved: (1) consecutive sample of patients enrolled
(yes or no); (2) inclusion and exclusion criteria defined;
and (3) spectrum of patients representative for CLI patients
normally receiving PTA.
Baseline patient characteristics There were no age
limits applied regarding patients. The following data on
patient population were extracted: (1) number of patients
included in the study and (2) analyzed in the final analysis;
(3) age of patients (mean ± SD, median and/or range); (4)

did not undergo primary or standard PTA (e.g., use of primary
stenting or drug eluting stent) or it was not clear what number of
patients did undergo PTA. bIn several studies patients did undergo
PTA; however, no data were separately mentioned from other
procedures (e.g., bypass surgery)

 (mean ± SD in mmHg), ulcer classification (n ? percent-
age), Fontaine classification (III or IV), Rutherford classi-
fication (IV, V and VI) and other characteristics when
cited; and (15) anticoagulation/antiplatelet medication at
baseline (n ? percentage).
Procedure description The following data were extrac-
ted: (1) who performed the procedure (interventional
radiologist, vascular surgeon or other); (2) experience
defined (number of procedures performed or years of
experience); (3) which procedure was performed (only
PTA (balloon), PTA ? stent placement or other); and (4) if
the study was described in sufficient detail to permit its
replication (if information was provided as stated in pre-
vious items 1–3).
Angiographic outcomes and complications data were
extracted on how articles defined (1) technical success; (2)
partial success/failure; (3) complete technical failure; (4)
major complications; and (5) minor complications and how
many successes, failures and complications occurred.
Follow-up and dropout patients The following data
were extracted regarding follow-up: (1) a summary of
follow-up time and scheme; (2) if all patients underwent
the same follow-up (yes or no) and (3) were dropout
patients adequately reported (yes or no, with or without
reasons for dropout or unclear).
Clinical outcomes and predictive factors Data were
extracted on the three previously defined outcome vari-
ables: (1) ulcer healing; (2) AFS (major of minor) or limb
salvage and (3) overall survival at baseline and at least
1-year follow-up with a maximum of 5-year follow-up.
Data on predictive factors either in terms of regression
analysis (univariate or multivariate) were extracted.
Data Analysis
All data at baseline were presented as number plus per-
centage, with the exception of age, which is presented as a
mean. Because standard deviation was not available in all
datasets, result on baseline could not be pooled.
Data on ulcer healing, AFS and overall survival at
baseline and at least 1-year follow-up were recorded. Data
on predictive factors for ulcer healing, AFS (also limb
salvage) and survival were extracted as reported in papers.
As anticipated, the number of studies was limited. The data
were heterogeneously presented so even meta-analysis with
random effect approach would not be suitable for pooling
predictive values. All data are therefore presented per
study.
Results
Search, Selection and Inclusion of Relevant Articles
The search yielded 1635 studies: 734 from Pubmed and
901 from EMBASE (see Appendix 1).
After excluding duplicates (240), letters/comments/edi-
torials (57), conferences (354), case reports (42), other
languages than English, Dutch, French or German (38),
reviews and guidelines (228), study protocols (7), articles
not involving CLI (37) and seven articles of which the full
article could not be obtained, 625 articles on CLI remained.
Subsequently, articles were excluded based on title and
abstract because they had less than 50 patients (136), they
did not undergo PTA (152), were retrospective in nature
(146) or had less than 1 year of follow-up (8) which yiel-
ded 183 potentially relevant articles. Full texts of these
articles were checked on inclusion criteria: 173 articles did
not meet the inclusion criteria and ten studies were inclu-
ded for data extraction (see Fig. 1) [21–30].
Study Design Characteristics
Of the ten articles included, all were cohort studies; most
studies were performed based on prospective-designed
databases and were single center. In all studies, there was
no role of funders (see Table 1).
Patient Selection
The patient selection was consecutive in most of the
studies. In all studies, patients were included with CLI;
however, the spectrum of patients was equivocal, as in one
study only patients [ 80 years were included [21], only
diabetic patients [22], only hemodialysis patients [27] or
patients with Rutherford V and VI [28] (see Table 2).
Baseline Patient Characteristics
In total, 2448 patients were included who were CLI
patients and underwent PTA with or without bare metal
stent placement. Mean ages ranged from 50 to 85.9 years.
Male-to-female ratio was 816:534 in the seven studies
mentioning this ratio [21–23, 27–30]. In addition, a broad
range of risk factors was present: smoking rate from 6.9 to
58.3%, diabetes from 49.1 to 100%, hypertension from
51.6 to 98%, dyslipidaemia from 21.1 to 65% and renal
disease up to 100%. Other risk factors such as coronary
artery disease, cerebrovascular disease and stroke were also
present in the majority of patients (see Table 3).
ABI was mentioned in only small number of studies,
other measurements such as toe pressure and ankle pressure
4
S. M. Schreuder et al.: Predictive Parameters for Clinical Outcome in Patients with Critical…
123
 were only mentioned in the study of Strom et al. (toe
pressure mean 30 mmHg [range 0–60 mmHg] and ankle
pressure mean 50 mmHg [range 0–60 mmHg]) [30]. The
TcPO2 was not mentioned in any of the studies. The dis-
ease severity in terms of Fontaine classification or
Rutherford category was described heterogeneously (see
Table 4).
Procedure Description, Outcomes
and Complications
In most studies, it was not clear who performed the pro-
cedure. Moreover, the experience of the operator was not
defined in any of the studies. In none of the studies, the
procedure was described in sufficient detail to replicate.
The angiographic outcome in terms of technical success
was defined well, and complications were reported in
detail.
All data on procedure description and outcomes are
given in detail in Table 5.
Follow-Up and Dropout Patients
The follow-up was not homogeneous, but in general
1 month, 3-, 6- and 12-month follow-up was done. Patients
did not undergo the same follow-up in seven studies, while
in three studies patients did undergo the same follow-up.
Dropout rates are poorly reported. Only one study [24]
accurately reported dropouts, with missing baseline infor-
mation as most frequent reason for dropout. Follow-up
ranged from less than 1 month up to 109 months. All
details are given in Table 6.
Clinical Outcomes: Ulcer Healing, AFS/Limb
Salvage and Survival
Ulcer Healing
In three studies [22, 25, 28], data on ulcer healing were
given. It seems that complete healing can be achieved in
most of the patients within 1 year [25, 28]. Details are
given in Table 7.
AFS or Limb Salvage
In all studies [21–30], data on AFS or limb salvage were
given. One-year AFS ranged from 49.5 to 75.2%, 2-year
AFS from 37 to 58% and 3-year AFS from 22 to 59%. The
limb salvage rates for 1 month, 1 year, 2 year and 3 year
range from 95 to 97.4%, 71 to 95%, 54 to 93.3% and 32 to
92.7%, respectively. All data are given in Table 8.

 Survival
Survival rates were described in nine studies [21–29] with
at least 3-year follow-up in most of the studies (see
Table 9). The survival rates for 1 month, 1 year, 2 years
and 3 years range from 94 to 100%, 65.4 to 91.5%, 45.7 to
76% and 37.3 to 83.1%, respectively.
Predictive Factors
When data were available on predictive values, these data
were also extracted (see Table 10). However, these data
were presented heterogeneously. We extracted all data as
given in the studies. In general for univariate analysis, data
were given either (1) at a time point (e.g., AFS at 2 years)
by Fisher exact test or Chi-square test (2 9 2 tables) or
Student’s t test (continuous normally distributed data) or
Mann–Whitney tests (continuous not normally distributed
data) or by association tests (continuous data) or (2) as time
dependent by Kaplan–Meier analysis (with log rank test,
for binary data) or Cox regression analysis (for multino-
mial or continuous data). Finally, multivariate analysis in
either stepwise multiple regression analysis was used (at
one time point) or Cox proportional regression analysis (for
time dependent data) was performed.
Predictive Factors in Ulcer Healing
Number of studies reporting predictive factors is limited
[22, 28] with different predictive factors (see Table 10).
Predictive Factors in AFS or Limb Salvage
Predictive factors for AFS or limb salvage were reported in
nine studies [21, 23–30]. All studies had different uni-
variate and multivariate outcomes; however, age and dia-
betes were found to be significant predictors in at least
three studies [21, 23, 24, 27]. See details in Table 10.
Predictive Factors in Survival Analysis
Also for the survival analysis, different predictive factors
were found; however, age was found in 2 [22, 25] out of 5
studies reporting on predictive factors (see Table 10).
Based on these findings, age and diabetes should be at least
taken into account when searching for predictive factors.

 Discussion
Summary
In this review, we summarized the findings on predictive
factors for wound healing, AFS and survival in CLI
patients who underwent a PTA. As stated, the data were
heterogeneously reported and presented. In addition, none
of the studies found the same predictive factors. However,
in several studies age and diabetes were found as predictive
factors for AFS or limb salvage and survival. Several
univariate studies showed age and diabetes as predictors
[12, 31–33].
Compared with Other Studies
To our knowledge, no such systematic review has been
published. There is a review [34] in which the authors

 summarized risk stratification models for CLI with a
summary of the respective strengths and limitations of
each. These models were developed from prospective
cohorts to identify and quantify variables that can subse-
quently predict outcome in individual patients. In the
prospective
cohort,
treatment options generally
were
compared (e.g., open and endovascular therapies) and new
therapeutics were evaluated. The outcomes were not
specific for defining risk models in patients with CLI
patients undergoing PTA.
Strength of this Review
The major strength of our study is that we focussed on
patients with CLI who underwent PTA to identify possible
predictive factors for clinically relevant outcomes. We
have done this to create a homogeneous and clinically
relevant population, in order to draw conclusions.
We included studies which aimed to study predictive
values of all types of risk factors. In addition, we only
selected
prospective
studies
or
studies
that
used
a
prospective database, to have a predefined design without
missing a lot of data. It is known that missing data are
much more common in retrospective studies, in which
routinely collected data are subsequently used for a dif-
ferent purpose [35].
Limitations of this Review
Although all studies were performed prospectively or a
prospective database was present with a spectrum of
patients which are represented, the data were presented too
heterogeneously. Even the AFS or survival analysis was
not reported homogeneously. The presented data on the
predictive values varied even more, making general con-
clusions difficult.
Conclusion and Recommendations
It is not clear which risk factors should be taken into
account. However, in several studies two factors, age and
diabetes, were found as predictive factors for AFS or limb

 salvage and survival in patients with CLI undergoing PTA.
Therefore, we believe that these factors should be taken
into account in the future when searching for predictive
factors and when analyzing study data on endovascular
treatments for CLI. More research on this topic is needed.
A trial with registry of all risk factors and the outcomes up
to 12 months would be very important. Future research is
needed to simplify and improve the accuracy and gener-
alizability of risk stratification in CLI.
