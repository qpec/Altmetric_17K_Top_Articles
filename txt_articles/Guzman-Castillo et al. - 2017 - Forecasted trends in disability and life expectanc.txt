Summary
Background Reliable estimation of future trends in life expectancy and the burden of disability is crucial for ageing 
societies. Previous forecasts have not considered the potential impact of trends in disease incidence. The present 
prediction model combines population trends in cardiovascular disease, dementia, disability, and mortality to forecast 
trends in life expectancy and the burden of disability in England and Wales up to 2025.
Methods We developed and validated the IMPACT-Better Ageing Model—a probabilistic model that tracks the 
population aged 35–100 years through ten health states characterised by the presence or absence of cardiovascular 
disease, dementia, disability (difficulty with one or more activities of daily living) or death up to 2025, by use of 
evidence-based age-specific, sex-specific, and year-specific transition probabilities. As shown in the English 
Longitudinal Study of Ageing, we projected continuing declines in dementia incidence (2·7% per annum), 
cardiovascular incidence, and mortality. The model estimates disability prevalence and disabled and disability-free life 
expectancy by year.
Findings Between 2015 and 2025, the number of people aged 65 years and older will increase by 19·4% (95% uncertainty 
interval [UI] 17·7–20·9), from 10·4 million (10·37–10·41 million) to 12·4 million (12·23–12·57 million). The number 
living with disability will increase by 25·0% (95% UI 21·3–28·2), from 2·25 million (2·24–2·27 million) to 
2·81 million (2·72–2·89 million). The age-standardised prevalence of disability among this population will remain 
constant, at 21·7% (95% UI 21·5–21·8) in 2015 and 21·6% (21·3–21·8) in 2025. Total life expectancy at age 65 years 
will increase by 1·7 years (95% UI 0·1–3·6), from 20·1 years (19·9–20·3) to 21·8 years (20·2–23·6). Disability-free 
life expectancy at age 65 years will increase by 1·0 years (95% UI 0·1–1·9), from 15·4 years (15·3–15·5) to 16·4 years 
(15·5–17·3). However, life expectancy with disability will increase more in relative terms, with an increase of roughly 
15% from 2015 (4·7 years, 95% UI 4·6–4·8) to 2025 (5·4 years, 4·7–6·4).
Interpretation The number of older people with care needs will expand by 25% by 2025, mainly reflecting population 
ageing rather than an increase in prevalence of disability. Lifespans will increase further in the next decade, but a 
quarter of life expectancy at age 65 years will involve disability.

Introduction
The substantial expansion in life expectancy and 
population ageing during the 20th century is continuing 
into the 21st century. Life expectancy at age 65 years 
among the 27 countries of the European Union has 
increased from 17·8 years in 2002, to 20·0 years in 2014.1 
Rapid ageing of populations in developed countries is set 
to continue; however, evidence about trends in morbidity 
and disability prevalence in the past few decades is 
inconsistent.2,3
Policy makers, service planners, and clinicians need 
reliable forecasts of future trends in life expectancy and 
the burden of disease and disability. Current projections 
involve simple extrapolations that fail to consider the 
combined effect that trends in disease incidence, 
particularly cardiovascular disease and dementia, will 
have on the health status of older people. In the UK, 
concerns exist regarding potential increases in age-
related disability. Between 1991 and 2011, findings from 
the Cognitive Function and Ageing Study (CFAS)4 
showed that although total life expectancy and disability-
free life expectancy increased, the proportion of life 
without disability decreased.
Trends in life expectancy and disability are shaped 
primarily by trends in the burden of cardiovascular 
disease and dementia.5–7 Both conditions are important 
underlying causes of age-related disability, particularly 
in middle-income and high-income countries.7 Cardio-
vascular disease morbidity and mortality have fallen 
greatly in the past few decades.8,9 The associated 
prolongation of life expectancy has enlarged the pool of 
individuals surviving to old age and hence susceptible 
to dementia. Furthermore, because dementia and 
cardiovascular disease share behavioural and biomedical 
risk factors,5,10 reduction in vascular risk might also reduce 
age-specific dementia incidence.11–13 On the basis of these

two opposing effects, forecasting of the projected 
prevalence of disability requires simultaneous modelling 
of both conditions.
Previous studies have not considered the complex 
synergies of life expectancy, cardiovascular disease, and 
dementia, nor the contribution of these chronic conditions 
to disability over time.14 We therefore aimed to forecast 
trends in disability and life expectancy in England and 
Wales up to 2025, simultaneously accounting for time-
varying trends in morbidity and mortality.
Methods
Model design
We developed and validated the IMPACT-Better Ageing 
Model (IMPACT-BAM)—a discrete-time probabilistic 
Markov model that follows the progression of a healthy 
population (aged 35–100 years) of England and Wales 
from 2006 to 2025 into eight different states characterised 
by the presence or absence of cardiovascular disease, 
cognitive impairment, and moderate-to-severe functional 
impairment (moderate-to-severe disability), and two states 
for death from cardiovascular disease and non-
cardiovascular disease causes (appendix p 14). Movements 
of the population between these ten states are governed 
by 1 year age-specific, sex-specific, and year-specific 
probabilities of transition. IMPACT-BAM is a population 
model such that for each year in the simulation, a new 
cohort of 35-year-olds enters the system through the 
disease-free state.
Data sources
We combined age-specific and sex-specific population 
estimates from the Office for National Statistics with 
prevalence data from the English Longitudinal Study of 
Ageing (ELSA)15 to populate all the states in the model at 
the start of the simulation. We used projections from the 
Office for National Statistics until 2025 to create the 
input population vector of 35-year-olds assumed to be 
disease-free at entry. Data for calculation of probabilities 
of transition were also from ELSA.15
Health states
We defined cardiovascular disease as a diagnosis of 
cardiovascular disease; myocardial infarction; or stroke 
or angina, or both. We defined cognitive impairment 
without dementia as impairment in two or more domains 
of cognitive function tests applied to ELSA participants 
(such as orientation to time, immediate and delayed 
memory, verbal fluency, and numeracy function). For 
individuals who were unable to take the cognitive 
function tests, the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive 
Decline (IQCODE) was administered to a proxy 
informant (usually an immediate family member).16 A 
score higher than 3·6 on the IQCODE was used to 
identify cognitive impairment without dementia. We 
defined functional impairment or disability as the 
inability to independently do one or more activities of 
daily living, which included getting in or out of bed, 
walking across a room, bathing or showering, using the 
toilet, dressing, cutting food, and eating. This definition 
of disability captures numbers of individuals who have 
difficulty maintaining self-care independence and 
require supportive care.
We defined dementia on the basis of the coexistence of 
cognitive impairment and functional impairment, or a 
report of a doctor diagnosis of dementia by the participant 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Between Oct 1, and Oct 30, 2016, we searched PubMed for 
studies forecasting future trends in disability or dementia in the 
UK, with the search terms “disability”, “dementia”, “longevity”, 
“life expectancy”, “forecasting”, “simulation”, “model” and 
synonyms of “United Kingdom”. The appendix (pp 12, 13) lists 
our complete PubMed search strings and shows results of our 
systematic review of the literature. We did additional hand 
searches with lists of references retrieved from relevant papers. 
We identified only two studies forecasting total life expectancy at 
age 65 years, neither of which investigated disability or 
disability-free life expectancies, and two studies reporting a 
future number of cases with disability in England and Wales. 
None of these studies modelled future trends in disability and life 
expectancy while explicitly including interactions between trends 
in cardiovascular disease and dementia.
Added value of this study
To our knowledge, this is the first study to model future trends 
in disability in the UK using empirical longitudinal data for 
England and Wales while also taking into account interactions 
over time between cardiovascular disease, dementia, and 
disability. Our findings show that people in England and Wales 
will live longer but, on average, a quarter of the extra years 
gained after age 65 years will involve disability. The overall 
burden of disability will grow primarily as a consequence of 
population ageing rather than an increase in the prevalence of 
disability. These predictions have profound individual and 
societal implications.
Implications of all available evidence
Changes in vascular risk factors are considered to be the primary 
drivers of trends in cardiovascular disease and dementia 
incidence; therefore, future forecasts of disability need to take 
into account the interaction of these conditions over time. 
Simulation modelling offers a platform to gain new insights to 
inform these projections and highlight opportunities for 
further refinement. Subsequent research should identify which 
prevention strategies might provide the biggest health and 
economic benefits in the future.

or caregiver. Transitions to the two death states (cardio-
vascular disease or non-cardiovascular disease causes) 
were possible from any health state (appendix p 14). We 
distinguished four disability states: cardiovacular disease-
related disability; dementia-related disability; cardio-
vacular disease-related and dementia-related disability; 
and other disease-related disability, defined as other 
forms of disability not linked to cardiovascular disease or 
dementia.
Model assumptions and outputs
We assumed that population trends in cardiovascular 
disease incidence would parallel the rate of decline in 
cardiovascular disease mortality up to 2025, as observed 
in ELSA for the period 2002–13.15 We further assumed 
that dementia incidence would follow a 2·7% relative 
annual decline, as also observed in ELSA.
IMPACT-BAM was used to calculate future trends in 
the prevalence of disability (both age-specific and 
age-standardised using the population in 2015), life 
expectancy, disabled life expectancy, and disability-free 
life expectancy according to the Sullivan method.17 
The model was implemented as a statistical package 
in R software. Appendix pp 13–23 provide detailed 
information about data sources, definitions of health 
states, and methods.
Sensitivity analyses
In view of uncertainty regarding trends in dementia 
incidence, we tested two alternative assumptions for the 
trend in future dementia incidence: constant incidence 
(no annual decline) and an annual decline of 4% in 
dementia incidence (appendix pp 24, 25).
To explore the effect of parameter uncertainty on model 
outputs, we did a probabilistic sensitivity analysis using 
Monte Carlo simulation. The procedure entailed 
iterative sampling from specified distributions for the 
input parameters used in the model and recalculation 
of the outputs. We did 1000 iterations to estimate 
95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) for the output variables. 
Appendix p 25 provides additional details of distributions 
and statistical functions.
Model validation
To validate cardiovascular disease and non-cardiovascular 
disease deaths, we compared our model estimates with 
observed mortality data from the Office of National 
Statistics for the period 2006–12. For cardiovascular 
disease prevalence, we compared our model estimates 
with those published by the Health Survey for England 
2011. For disability prevalence, we compared 2014 
prevalence estimates from the most recent wave in ELSA 
(not used in the design of the model) with our estimates. 
For dementia prevalence, we compared our model 
estimates with those reported in the CFAS II.3 Finally, we 
compared our estimates of life expectancy at age 65 years 
for the period 2006–12 with those reported by the 
European Health and Life Expectancy Information 
System (EHLEIS) and the Office of National Statistics 
(appendix pp 27–31).

The funder of the study had no role in study design, data 
collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of 
the report. The corresponding author had full access to 
all the data in the study and final responsibility for the 
decision to submit for publication.
Results
Our projections indicate that the number of people in 
England and Wales aged 65 years and older will increase 
by roughly 19·4% (95% UI 17·7–20·9), from 10·4 million 
(10·37–10·41 
million) 
in 
2015, 
to 
12·4 
million 
(12·23–12·57 million) in 2025. Notably, the number of 
people aged 85 years and older will increase by 38·9% 
(95% UI 31·9–45·5), from 1·4 million (1·38–1·45 million) 
in 2015, to 2·0 million (1·87–2·07 million) in 2025.
The age-specific disability prevalence between 2002 
and 2013 in ELSA ranged from 14% in people aged 
65–69 years to 57% in those aged 90 years and older 
(appendix p 26). Additionally, we estimated that 53% of 
all people aged 65 years or older with disability had 
cardiovascular 
disease 
or 
cognitive 
impairment 
(appendix pp 26, 27). We predict that, between 2015 and 
2025, the number of people living with disability will 
increase by about 2·3% per annum (table 1). By 2025, 
roughly 2·8 million people will be living with disability, 
an additional 560 000 cases compared with 2015 (a 
25·0% overall increase; table 1). The number of men 
living with disabilities will increase by roughly 3% per 
year to reach 1·24 million cases in 2025, whereas the 
number of women living with disabilities will increase 
by 1·7% per year to reach 1·58 million cases in 2025 
(table 1, figure 1).

Between 2015 and 2025, other disease-related disability 
will remain the most frequent type of disability among 
people aged 65–84 years, whereas dementia-related and 
cardiovascular disease-related disability will persist as the 
most common types of disability among people aged 
85 years or older (table 2). The numbers of other disease-
related disability cases among people aged 65–84 years 
will increase in the next decade by about 31%, and the 
number of dementia-related disability cases by about 
40%; however, the cases of cardiovascular disease-related 
disability will decline by about 17% (table 2). In people 
aged 85 years or older, the numbers of other disease-
related disability, dementia-related disability, and cardio-
vascular disease-related disability will increase by 84%, 
63%, and 6%, respectively (table 2).
The age-standardised prevalence of disability in the 
population aged 65 years or older will remain broadly 
constant to 2025 in both men and women (figure 1). 
A modest increase of 1·6% in prevalence is predicted in 
the oldest men in the next decade (table 3); however, 
trends in age-standardised prevalence will differ by type 
of disability: prevalence of cardiovascular disease-related 
disability will decline by about 30%, whereas prevalence 
of dementia-related and other disease-related disability 
will increase by about 14% (appendix pp 4–6).
Overall in people aged 65 years, total life expectancy, 
disability-free life expectancy, and life expectancy with 
disability will increase in the entire population between 
2015 and 2025 (table 4), and there will be increases in life 
expectancy in all age groups (figure 2). Appendix p 31 
compares the life expectancy estimates in our study with 
those from other studies. Disability-free life expectancy 
at age 65 years will increase by 1·0 years, from 15·4 years 
to 16·4 years; however, life expectancy with disability will 
grow more in relative terms (about 15% increase from 
2015; table 4). For both health expectancies, bigger 
increases are predicted for men than for women (table 4). 
Overall, the proportion of the life expectancy lived with 
disabilities at age 65 years will increase from 21·4% to 
24·0% in men and 24·9% to 25·8% in women (table 4).
Results of our sensitivity analysis showed that estimates 
of numbers of people with disability remained almost 
unchanged despite different calendar trends in incidence 
of dementia (appendix p 8). Furthermore, the proportion 
of life expectancy lived with disability will remain 
virtually unchanged from the baseline scenario for both 
men and woman (appendix p 11). However, the 
two alternative assumptions regarding the trend in 
future dementia incidence do affect the numbers in the 
disease-specific disability (appendix pp 7–11). If dementia 
incidence remains unchanged over the next decade, the 
cases of dementia-related disability will increase 
compared to our main prediction. This increase will be 
counterbalanced by a decrease in the number of cases of 
other types of disability, including cardiovascular disease-
related disability. Conversely, a faster annual decline in 
dementia incidence would result in fewer cases of 
dementia-related disability, but an increase in the 
numbers of other types of disability.
We validated key model outputs against empirical 
observations. The model provided a good match with 
the Office for National Statistics estimates of the 
number of cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular deaths 
(appendix pp 28, 29). Our estimates of cardiovascular 
disease prevalence in 2011 were similar to those reported

by the Health Survey England, particularly for men 
(appendix p 29). Our findings for disability prevalence in 
2014 for women were very similar to those reported by 
ELSA wave 7; however, our model estimates a slightly 
lower prevalence of disability in men (appendix p 30). 
Our age-specific estimates of dementia in 2011 were 
similar to those reported in CFAS II (appendix p 30). Our 
estimates of life expectancy at 65 years for 2006–15 were 
similar to those reported by the Office of National 
Statistics and EHLEIS (appendix pp 30, 31).
Discussion
Our life expectancy and disability forecasts are based on a 
Markov model, which, for the first time, synthesises 
the combined effects of present trends in incidence of 
cardiovascular disease, dementia disability, and mortality. 
Our findings show that the number of people aged 65 years 
or older with care needs in England and Wales could reach 
2·8 million by 2025. This 25% increase will mainly reflect 
population ageing rather than an increase in the prevalence 
of disability. Lifespans will increase further, but a quarter 
of life expectancy at age 65 years will involve disability.
Other forms of disability not linked to cardiovascular 
disease or dementia will persist between 2015 and 2025 as 
the most frequent type of disability among people aged 
65–84 years. Our findings are consistent with those from 
a 2016 analysis of the most important contributors to 
global disability burden for this age group.18 For people 
older than 85 years, future disability levels will be 
influenced mainly by the joint evolution of the burdens of 
dementia and cardiovascular disease over time. Evidence 
suggests that declines in cardiovascular disease incidence 
and mortality in the past few decades are set to continue.8,9 
Encouragingly, progressive declines in the incidence of 
dementia have been reported in the past 20 years in 
Europe and the USA;11–13 however, the size of the decline 
varied across these study populations. To account for this 
uncertainty, we modelled the 2·7% annual decline 
observed in ELSA15 and showed that the projected burden 
of disability was robust to two alternative assumptions 
about the future dementia incidence trend, 0% and 4%.
Our projections of life expectancy at 65 years are broadly 
similar to those from the Office of National Statistics and 
other studies;19,20 the largest differences are for women, 
for whom our projections are lower. In developed 
countries, women have tended to live longer, but to have 
worse health than men.21 Excess mortality in men has 
been attributed to higher prevalence of life-threatening 
chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease.22 
Therefore, the higher increment in life expectancy for 
men than for women between 2015 and 2025, could be 
explained by life expectancy in men being more sensitive 
to the declining trends in cardiovascular disease incidence 
and mortality observed in ELSA over the past decade 
and projected forward in our model. Although women 
have poorer health than men, attributable to a higher 
prevalence of dementia and functional limitations, our 
results suggest the present sex difference in disabled life 
expectancy will diminish because men will have a 
relatively larger increase in the burden of disability.
Two previous studies have predicted future numbers 
of disability cases in England and Wales. Jagger and 
colleagues23 used a macro-simulation model of cohort 
transitions between non-disabled, disabled, and death 
states from 1992 to 2026. The investigators estimated 
transition probabilities from CFAS I conditional on the 
prevalence of several chronic conditions and assuming 
their prevalence to be constant over the forecasting 
period. Comas-Herrera and colleagues24 applied age-
specific and sex-specific prevalence of cognitive 
impairment and disability observed in 2002 (also based 
on CFAS I) to Government Actuary Department’s

population projections in 2031, again assuming that 
dementia incidence will be constant over time. 
Comparisons of these studies with ours are indirect 
because the definitions of disability differ. Corres-
pondingly, both previous studies predicted a smaller 
future burden of disability than IMPACT-BAM. This 
divergence arises largely because estimates of disability 
prevalence in the base year of respective models (CFAS 
I: 1992, ELSA: 2002) depend on the number of activities 
included in the activities of daily living instrument. The 
ELSA instrument included six activities, compared with 
three in CFAS I.25 The greater the number of items of 
activities of daily living, the higher the probability of 
detection of disabilities.
Credible predictions of future prevalence of disability 
and life expectancy need to consider the complex 
population dynamics of lifespan and the major disability 
determinants. IMPACT-BAM responds to these require-
ments by modelling two major diseases with shared and 
strongly interrelated determinants, both of which are 
associated with substantial functional impairment.5,10 
Few studies have attempted to estimate future disability 
in England and Wales on the basis of dementia trends.23,24 
Moreover, none has explicitly considered transitions 
between cardiovascular disease, dementia, and functional 
impairment states while simultaneously taking into 
account changing time trends in dementia incidence, 
cardiovascular disease incidence, cardiovascular disease 
mortality, and non-cardiovascular disease mortality. 
Furthermore, our model parameters derive from the best 
available population-based longitudinal evidence in the 
UK, and cross-validation of our projections used external 
data sources and estimates.
Prediction modelling has limitations. First, IMPACT-
BAM aggregates disability caused by conditions such as 
musculoskeletal disorders, mental disorders, diabetes, 
chronic respiratory diseases, and other chronic diseases in 
a single other disease-related disability state. Transitions 
from this state to other states in the model are not 
conditioned to the prevalence of these specific chronic 
conditions. However, because ELSA is representative 
of the English population, the estimated transition 
probabilities to cardiovascular disease, dementia, or death 
from this combined state are likely to represent a weighted 
average of risk across all comorbidities. Although outside 
the scope of our study, consideration of disability on a 
spectrum of severity has important implications for 
health-care planning and policy, because each level of 
severity generates corresponding needs in care and 
assistance. Our binary definition of disability is relevant to 
future demand of long-term care because it provides a 
transparent basis for estimation of the trend in numbers 
of individuals who would require supportive care. Finally, 
the cohort of 35-year-olds populating the model every year 
was obtained from official population projections.26 These 
principal projections are based on assumptions regarding 
future levels of fertility, migration, and mortality, which 
might add uncertainty to our estimates. However, 
population projections have proved to be relatively robust 
to mortality assumptions, whereas fertility and migrant 
variant assumptions only affect the projected numbers of 
children and young adults.26
The societal, economic, and public health implications 
of our forecast are substantial. In particular, our findings 
draw attention to the scale of societal costs associated 
with disability in the coming decade. Public and private 
expenditure on long-term care will need to increase 
considerably by 2025, in view of the predicted 25% rise in 
the number of people who will have age-related disability. 
This situation has serious implications for a cash-
strapped and overburdened National Health Service, 
and an under-resourced social care system.
In the context of the rapid and continuing rise in the 
number of older dependent people in the UK, the 
government needs to give urgent consideration to options 
for more cost-effective health and social care provision in 
all its forms. First, national capacity for institutional care 
needs to increase. Second, informal and home care 
require stronger policy support, for example by means of 
tax allowances or cash benefits. Affected individuals and 
their families pay an estimated 40% of the national cost of 
long-term care from income and savings.27 Notably, the 
disadvantage of older people on lower incomes unable to 
live independently will increase if the shortage of 
caregivers and the precarious state of institutional and 
domiciliary care provision is not addressed.28
Cardiovascular disease and dementia share risk factors—
namely, poor diet, smoking, high alcohol consumption, 
hypertension, diabetes, and physical inactivity. Effective 
prevention strategies are therefore strongly advocated by 
UK health charities, the National Institute of Health and 
Care Excellence, and WHO.29,30 This shared-determinants 
approach is an important but neglected strategy for 
reducing the future burden of disability at the population 
level.

prevention policies could be substantially cost-saving.31 
Policy simulation modelling based on interventions aimed 
at the drivers of disability is needed to inform this debate. 
Potential prevention strategies include healthy food 
interventions, fiscal measures for obesity control, and 
disease-specific health-care-based interventions.
In conclusion, our evidence-based forecasting model, 
incorporating the expected continuing declines in cardio-
vascular disease and dementia incidence, predicts that 
the number of people living with disability will increase 
over the next decade. This increase mainly reflects the 
expected continuing rise in life expectancy and resulting 
upward shift in the age distribution of the population. 
The rising burden of age-related disability accompanying 
population ageing poses a substantial societal challenge 
and emphasises the urgent need for policy development 
that includes effective prevention interventions.
