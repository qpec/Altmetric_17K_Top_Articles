ABSTRACT
Obesity has traditionally been thought of as a state of
caloric imbalance, where the intake of calories exceeds
the expenditure or ‘burning’ of calories. However, a
more nuanced appreciation for the complex
biochemistry and physiology of cellular energy
generation suggests that obesity is a state of hormonal
imbalance causing increased shunting of food energy
into adipose tissue for storage, resulting in decreased
satiety and ultimately leading to increased caloric intake.
Adding to this hypothesis, we propose that obesity is
also a state of nutrient and energy deficit, leading to
decreased fatty acid mobilisation and oxidation, the
result of which may be a natural disinclination towards
physical activity. Added sugars (sucrose, a.k.a. table
sugar and high-fructose corn syrup) may provide
energy (4 kcal/g) but at current intakes they do not
facilitate—and may even hinder—the production of
energy. Not only do added sugars displace nutritionally
superior foods in the diet, but they may also deplete
nutrients from other foods that have been consumed, as
well as from body stores, in order to enable their proper
oxidation and liberate their calories as energy.
Additionally, the consumption of added sugars
damages the mitochondria and hence impairs energy
generation. Moreover, overconsuming added sugars
may result in a kind of ‘internal starvation’ (via leptin
and insulin resistance) leading to further hunger signals
in the body. Added sugars promote nutrient and energy
deficit and through this novel pathway promote obesity.
INTRODUCTION
Nutrient/energy deficit in obesity
Sugar was first extracted from sugar cane and
sugar beets hundreds of years ago, and later
‘purified’ into a white crystalline form. In
modern times, sugar has been isolated and
refined to a degree that allows it to be inte-
grated into the food supply in quantities and
concentrations that do not occur naturally
and are unlikely to have been encountered in
human evolutionary history. Pure crystalline
sugar, high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) and
other caloric sweeteners consumed in bev-
erages and processed foods provide a supra-
physiological glycaemic load,1 overwhelming
the body’s processing capacity and leading to
detrimental metabolic effects (eg, hypergly-
caemia,
hyperinsulinaemia
and
oxidative
stress).1 Because of this refinement, added
sugars now behave like drug-like substances.2 3
Although edible, added sugars cannot be con-
sidered a ‘food’, nor can their consumption
be equated to eating foods that contain
natural amounts of sugar, but which also
provide fibre, vitamins, minerals and other
phytonutrients that combat oxidative stress
produced by the small amounts of fructose
present. As the ‘dose makes the poison’, the
food industry has made it possible for consu-
mers to easily ‘overdose’ on added sugars,
making this an issue of concern for public
health worldwide, wherever there is signifi-
cant
consumption
of
processed,
highly
refined and sugar-dense foods.
Added sugars are not food
Sugar
is
not
among
the
recommended
foods. Its recent rationing will not provoke a
hardship,
for
sugar
supplies
nothing
in
nutrition but calories, and the vitamins pro-
vided by other foods are sapped by sugar to liberate
these calories.4 (Emphasis added) (Wilder—
Handbook of Nutrition)
The definition of food is, ‘Material that con-
tains essential nutrients, which are assimilated
by an organism to produce energy, stimulate
growth and maintain life’.5 Many types of
added sugars do not fit this definition. While
caloric sweeteners such as honey, maple syrup,
molasses and sorghum syrup (also known as
‘free sugars’) may provide trace amounts of
micronutrients, the sweetening agents most
commonly added to processed foods—sucrose
and HFCS—do not. In fact, these added
sugars not only lack essential nutrients, but
they also have detrimental effects on all three
important functions of food (eg, produce
energy, stimulate growth and maintain life).
These two added sugars (sucrose and HFCS)
will be the disaccharides of focus in this review.
Added sugars do not produce energy or
stimulate growth

food—‘produce energy’—added sugars in

 fact deplete energy from the body, either by depleting
tissue nutrient stores or nutrients obtained from other
ingested foods.4 Added sugars also displace nutritionally
superior foods from the diet and at the same time
increase nutritional requirements.4
6 Specifically, vita-
mins such as thiamine, riboflavin and niacin are neces-
sary for the oxidation of glucose, and phosphates are
stripped from ATP in order to metabolise fructose,
which leads to cellular ATP depletion.4 7 The metabol-
ism of fructose also leads to oxidative stress, inflamma-
tion and damage to the mitochondria, causing a state of
ATP depletion.8 Hence, the liberation of calories from
added sugars requires nutrients and increases nutri-
tional demands, but these sugars provide no additional
nutrients. Thus, the more added sugars one consumes,
the more nutritionally depleted one may become. This
may be particularly extreme in individuals whose habit-
ual diet is already insufficient in key micronutrients.
The conversion of food calories into energy in the
form of ATP does not occur by chance, with no require-
ments for input into the biochemical pathways involved.
Via glycolysis and the citric acid cycle, carbohydrates—
including refined sugars—are converted into energy.
The reactions these processes comprise are dependent
on required cofactors in the form of vitamins and miner-
als; however, isolated and refined sugars have been
stripped of their micronutrient content, which may
impair their conversion into energy and/or result in a
net nutrient deficit if such nutrients must be siphoned
from body stores in order to keep these processes
running efficiently. Contrast this with foods consumed
in their whole, unrefined forms, which typically contain
at least some of the nutrients required to liberate their
energy.
The popularity of low-carbohydrate diets for fat loss,
as well as their efficacy for improving a broad range of
health
conditions,9–12
has
led
to
an
unfortunate
across-the-board demonisation of carbohydrates among
some nutrition and healthcare professionals. While indi-
viduals who are insulin resistant or have type 2 diabetes,
pre-diabetes or the metabolic syndrome (which, accord-
ing to the American Diabetes Association, is well over
100 million people in the USA alone, including as
many as 26% of individuals aged 65 or older13) may
manage their blood glucose and insulin levels best on
reduced
carbohydrate
diets,10
11
14
it
is
not
carbohydrate-dense foods, per se, that contribute to
impaired energy production. Rather, it is carbohydrate
foods that have been stripped of their natural comple-
ment of nutrients and fibre and extracted from their
whole-food matrices that may be placing the largest
metabolic burden on the body, particularly when they
contain additional carbohydrates in the form of added
sugars, such as may be found in soft drinks and
cookies, crackers, bread, breakfast cereal, granola bars,
etc, made from refined grains with additional sugars
and
sweeteners
added
as
preservatives
and
for
enhanced palatability.
Glycolysis—the conversion of glucose to pyruvate with
a net yield of 2 ATP—requires magnesium as an enzyme
cofactor in at least six individual reactions. The pyruvate
dehydrogenase complex, which converts pyruvate to
acetyl-coenzyme A and is the link between glycolysis and
the citric acid cycle, requires thiamine, riboflavin, niacin
and pantothenic acid for proper enzymatic function.
B-vitamins are required again for effective functioning
of the citric acid cycle, which will produce an additional
36 ATP
, and is the process by which the majority of
energy is generated in all cells except those lacking
mitochondria.
Unlike
isolated
refined
sugars,
carbohydrate-rich whole foods—such as sweet potatoes,
white potatoes, beets, parsnips and winter squashes, as
well as whole grains, such as hard red winter wheat and
millet—provide critical minerals and B-vitamins required
for the proper use of these foods in the body. Added
sugars provide fuel in the form of carbohydrate but lack
the accessory nutrients needed to convert that fuel into
energy. We are not suggesting that each food consumed
must, in isolation, contain the full complement of nutri-
ents required for its metabolism and oxidation; a varied
omnivorous diet would be expected to meet these basic
nutritional
needs.
However,
consumption
of
large
amounts of added sugars may displace nutritionally
superior foods in the diet, ultimately resulting in a net
deficit
of
vitamin
and
mineral
enzyme
cofactors
required for not only the oxidation of the glucose, itself,
but for that of whole foods.
Additionally,
fructose
consumed
at
current
levels
found in much of the industrialised world has been
found to deplete cellular ATP levels in vascular endothe-
lial cells,15 with as little as 50 g of fructose (found in
approximately one 24 oz soft drink) being able to
deplete hepatic ATP levels in humans.16 17 This results
in appetite stimulation and increased hunger signals,
prompting increased caloric intake, which may ultim-
ately lead to weight gain and obesity.8 As the average
American consumes 83.1 g of fructose per day,18 with up
to
20%
of
the
population
exceeding
100 g/day,15
current levels of fructose consumption may lead to
chronic energy depletion causing increased hunger and
lack of energy to exercise. Thus, increased caloric intake
and reduced physical activity are logical consequences of
overconsuming added sugars. However, while the end
result may be obesity in susceptible individuals who are
simply following the biological cues prompted by these
hijacked metabolic processes, increased caloric intake
and a reduction in physical activity (ie, eating more and
moving less) are merely the proximal causes of body fat
gain; consumption of large amounts of refined sugars is
the ultimate underlying cause, triggering the cascade as
a whole.19 As many soft drinks are produced with HFCS
that contain up to 65% fructose, this is particularly con-
cerning.20–22 The overconsumption of added sugars
does not produce energy despite providing energy,
which is somewhat of a paradox. In order for a sub-
stance to be classified as ‘food’, it must produce or at

 least facilitate the production of energy, not just provide
energy.
The consumption of sugar and of other relatively pure
carbohydrates has become so great during recent years
that it presents a serious obstacle to the improved nutri-
tion of the general public.4 (The Council on Foods and
Nutrition, 1942)
Written over 70 years ago, this observation may be
even more relevant today. Indeed, many of the concerns
about the detrimental effects of sugar stem from its
current excessive consumption worldwide. Recent esti-
mates indicate that the average annual per capita con-
sumption of sugar ranges from 77 to 152 pounds,23 24
which is ∼20-fold to 40-fold greater than estimates of
consumption just a few hundred years ago.25 This level
of consumption equates to around 400–800 calories per
person per day from added sugars. On a diet of 2000
calories per day, 800 calories from added sugars repre-
sents a dilution of 40%, or a 40% displacement of foods
with higher nutrient density by foods that not only
provide fewer nutrients, but which may, in fact, require
increased nutrient intake simply to be metabolised. It is
easy to understand how consuming added sugars leads
to nutritional deficit.4 6
Soft
drink
consumption
is
associated
with
lower
intakes of calcium and other nutrients,26 which may
lead
to
malnutrition,
especially
in
children.2
Additionally, the overconsumption of added sugars is
linked to the development of insulin resistance in
humans and animals,27–30 which decreases the body’s
ability to use glucose as energy. Moreover, the ensuing
rise in insulin levels decreases the body’s ability to use its
other key fuel source, fats. (Via inhibition of hormone-
sensitive lipase, chronically elevated insulin keeps fatty
acids sequestered in adipose tissue, reducing their avail-
ability for β-oxidation and the generation of ATP
.31 32)
In essence, cells are starved for energy because energy
generation from fatty acids is inhibited when insulin
levels are high, resulting in what has been referred to as
‘internal starvation’ or ‘hidden cellular semistarvation’.33
More colloquially, it can be thought of as ‘starvation in
the land of plenty’. Not only that, but elevated insulin
levels increase energy requirements,31 further leading to
a net energy loss with the consumption of added sugars.
Owing to the lack of access to fuel substrates, individuals
with obesity and hyperinsulinaemia/insulin resistance
may fit the description of ‘overfed but undernourished’.
While they are carrying thousands of calories of stored
fuel in the form of adipose tissue, the hormonal pattern
that they are locked into due to the overconsumption of
refined sugars suggests that, at the cellular level, they are
starving.
Sugar also has the ability to derail an appetite for
nutrient-dense foods, causing further nutrient deple-
tion.2 This is likely caused by the elevation in insulin
levels prompted by refined carbohydrates, which may
lead to cravings for yet more carbohydrate due to insu-
lin’s effect on fuel partitioning and its inhibition of
energy generation from fatty acids.31 Animal studies also
show that feeding sugar to rats hinders growth and
shortens lifespan.18 34 Several other experiments in a
variety of animal species show that the addition of sugar
to otherwise adequate diets causes these animals to mal-
nourish themselves to death.35 And numerous studies in
animals indicate that replacing starch with sugar short-
ens their lifespan, so again, it is not carbohydrate, per
se, that has a detrimental effect, but rather, refined and
nutritionally void sugars.36–38 The aforementioned data
do not support the definition of food.
Finally, fructose and glucose favour the growth of bac-
teria and yeast,2 39–41 particularly in those who already
have elevated levels of yeast.42 Glucose has been found
to increase the proliferation and virulence of Candida
albicans.40 43 As C. albicans competes with host cells for
nutrients44 and requires a high influx of glucose (yield-
ing just two molecules of ATP for each molecule of
glucose metabolised via fermentation),45 this may be of
particular concern with added sugars feeding increasing
populations of intestinal yeast that then siphon nutrients
and energy from the rest of the body. Sugar has also
been shown to irritate the linings of the stomach and
intestine,2 25 which may compromise digestive function
and the absorption of nutrients. Finally, the hyperosmo-
lar effect of fructose can induce diarrhoea,46 which may
lead to a further loss of nutrients.2 Box 1 provides an
overview of the mechanisms relating the consumption of
added sugars with overall nutrient and energy depletion,
making added sugars unfit to be considered food.
Box 1
How added sugars promote obesity through
energy/nutrient depletion
▸ Displaces nutritionally superior foods.2
▸ Decreases appetite for more nutritious food.2
▸ Depletes nutrients within the body (in order to liberate the cal-
ories from sugar, as well as from an increase in bacterial and
yeast overgrowth).2
▸ Provides zero nutrition.2
▸ The consumption of added sugars has been shown to cause
insulin resistance.27–30 This will result in decreased use of
glucose for energy (decreased uptake into cells),47 as well as
impaired oxidation of fatty acids for energy.31
32 Energy
requirements are also increased due to elevated insulin
levels.33 Thus, because the consumption of added sugars can
lead to insulin resistance, they can induce a state of ‘internal
starvation’,
also
referred
to
as
‘hidden
cellular
semistarvation’.33
▸ Decreases nutrient absorption due to intestinal irritation/
damage.2 25
▸ Increases nutrient excretion caused by fructose malabsorption
leading to diarrhoea.46
▸ Damages the mitochondria and depletes ATP.8
▸ Produces unnatural drug-like cravings leading to a vicious
cycle of continued consumption and further nutrient depletion.

 Added sugars do not maintain life
Mankind has survived without isolated, refined sugar for
almost 2.6 million years.48 The body—in particular, the
brain—has been thought to require upwards of 200 g of
glucose per day, leading to the often cited dogma that
glucose is ‘essential for life’.1 While it is true that
glucose is essential for sustaining life, there is no
requirement for dietary glucose, as fatty acids can be
turned into brain-fuelling ketone bodies, and amino
acids
and
glycerol
are
gluconeogenic
substrates.49
Indeed, in the relative absence of dietary glucose,
ketone bodies may supply upwards of 75% of the brain’s
required energy, with the remainder supplied by gluco-
neogenesis provided by amino acids (from dietary
protein or catabolism of body proteins) and from gly-
cerol (provided by the breakdown of triglycerides in
adipose tissue).33 Thus, exogenous glucose (eg, from
added sugars) is not essential for sustaining life in
humans, and in most people, restricting dietary carbohy-
drates seems to produce no ill effects.49 In fact, accord-
ing to the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of
Medicine of the US National Academies of Sciences,
‘The lower limit of dietary carbohydrate compatible with
life apparently is zero, provided that adequate amounts
of protein and fat are consumed’.50
Administration of fructose or sucrose in humans has
been shown to cause each of the abnormalities that
define the metabolic syndrome (eg, elevated triglycer-
ides, low high-density lipoprotein, insulin resistance,
glucose intolerance, elevated blood glucose, elevated
blood pressure and weight gain (specifically around the
abdomen)),30 51–55 as well as features found in patients
with coronary heart disease (eg, increased platelet adhe-
siveness and hyperinsulinaemia),56 57 all of which can be
reversed entirely upon reverting to a diet
low in
sugar.47
52
56
58–60 Consumption of added sugars at
current levels of intake is proposed as a contributing
factor in a multitude of other diseases associated with
early mortality, such as cardiometabolic disease,61–64
obesity,30
61
65–68 β-cell dysfunction and type 2 dia-
betes,6 20 69–71 hypertension,51 64 72 non-alcoholic fatty
liver7 and atherosclerosis.6 73 74 Because of this, added
sugars cannot be considered food.
Moving forward
As ∼75% of all packaged foods and beverages in the
USA contain added sugars,75 efforts should focus on
their reduction in order to combat numerous chronic
disease states and improve the general nutritional status
of the population as a whole. We are not here advocat-
ing for the total elimination of added sugars from the
food supply. Such an approach is not only unnecessary,
but
is
also
economically
unrealistic
and
culturally
insensitive, as there are special events and celebrations
that may call for traditional foods that contain large
amounts
of
added
sugars.
Rather
than
complete
removal of added sugars from one’s diet, these metabol-
ically taxing elements should be limited to occasional
consumption
and
not
be
considered
daily
dietary
staples.
There are myriad ways to accomplish a population-
wide reduction in added sugars, including but not
limited to: widespread public education campaigns; revi-
sion of food labels to call attention to added sugar;
increased nutrition education in medical schools and
for other primary healthcare providers; the taxing of
edible goods high in added sugar;76–80 prohibition of
government subsidies for foods high in added sugars;81
restricting the sale of beverages and edible goods high
in added sugars (such as sports drinks, energy drinks
and sodas) in schools and hospitals; and adding warning
labels to sugar-sweetened beverages and other high-
sugar products, similar to those applied to alcohol and
tobacco.81 Such changes could contribute substantially
to reducing population-wide intake of added sugars to a
reasonable 5–10% of total caloric intake, which would
likely lead to substantial improvement in public health.82
CONCLUSION
We propose that obesity is a state of nutrient and energy
deficit brought about, in part, by the overconsumption
of added sugars (specifically high-fructose corn syrup
and sucrose). Added sugars provide energy (calories),
but in the context of consumption at current intake
levels, they hinder
the production
of energy, and
through the direct influence on a wide array of cardio-
metabolic disease processes, they lead to reduced quality
of life and decreased lifespan, and thus cannot be con-
sidered food. As added sugars devoid of micronutrients
displace more nutrient-dense foods in the diet, dilute
nutrients from the body’s stores and promote a host of
disease
states
that
impair
nutrient
absorption
and
energy homeostasis, efforts should be made to reduce
their ubiquity and current levels of consumption.
