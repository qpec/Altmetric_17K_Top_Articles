p to 30% of adults with acute myeloid leukemia fail to achieve
a complete remission after induction chemotherapy - termed
primary refractory acute myeloid leukemia. There is no univer-
sally agreed definition of primary refractory disease, nor have the opti-
mal treatment modalities been defined. We studied 8907 patients with
newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia, and examined outcomes in
patients with refractory disease defined using differing criteria which
have previously been proposed. These included failure to achieve com-
plete remission after one cycle of induction chemotherapy (RES), less
than a 50% reduction in blast numbers with >15% residual blasts after
one cycle of induction chemotherapy (REF1) and failure to achieve com-
plete remission after two courses of induction chemotherapy (REF2). 5-
year overall survival was decreased in patients fulfilling any criteria for
refractory disease, compared with patients achieving a complete remis-
sion after one cycle of induction chemotherapy: 9% and 8% in patients
with REF1 and REF 2 versus 40% (P<0.0001). Allogeneic stem cell trans-
plantation improved survival in the REF1 (HR 0.58 (0.46-0.74),
P=0.00001) and REF2 (HR 0.55 (0.41-0.74), P=0.0001) cohorts. The uti-
lization of REF1 criteria permits the early identification of patients
whose outcome after one course of induction chemotherapy is very
poor, and informs a novel definition of primary refractory acute
myeloid leukemia. Furthermore, these data demonstrate that allogeneic
stem cell transplantation represents an effective therapeutic modality in
selected patients with primary refractory acute myeloid leukemia.

ABSTRACT
Introduction
Up to 30% of adults with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) fail to
achieve a morphological complete remission (CR) after one or two courses of induc-
tion chemotherapy (IC).1 Although the outcome of AML refractory to IC is known
to be poor, the optimal management of this important cause of treatment failure
remains undetermined. 
Whilst a number of recent registry studies have demonstrated long-term survival
after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) in patients with primary refractory
AML (PREF AML), interpretation of these data are complicated by multiple factors,
 including limited cohort size, selection bias and lead time
reporting errors.2-7 Nonetheless, the advent of reduced
intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens, coupled with
increased numbers of alternative stem cell donors, has
resulted in allogeneic SCT becoming an increasingly deliv-
erable treatment option in PREF AML, emphasizing the
importance of defining its curative potential in this setting.
At the same time there remains considerable debate
concerning the definition of primary refractory disease.8
The International Working Group (IWG) and the
European LeukemiaNet (ELN) both define resistant dis-
ease after induction therapy as persistent leukemic blasts
in either the peripheral blood or the bone marrow in a
patient alive seven days or more following treatment.9,10
However, most studies investigating the impact of allo-
geneic SCT in AML refractory to induction therapy have
defined refractoriness as a failure to achieve CR following
two courses of chemotherapy.2,3,5,7,11,12 A number of reports
have demonstrated that failure to achieve CR after one
course of IC is an adverse prognostic indicator; however,
this has not been universally reported.13 The UK Medical
Research Council (MRC) data have previously demon-
strated that patients who had between 5-15% residual
leukemic blasts following their first cycle of IC had similar
relapse rates to those who achieved a CR, although they
demonstrated a reduced overall survival (OS).14 Schlenk et
al. analyzed 223 patients enrolled on the HD93 trial and
defined those with a <50% reduction in bone marrow
blasts following one course of IC as having refractory dis-
ease. In this relatively small study, patients with refractory
disease defined using this criterion demonstrated a lower
OS than patients in CR.15 Previous studies which have
defined refractory disease as failure to achieve a CR after
two courses of IC, have consistently demonstrated an
extremely poor survival rate in this sizeable proportion of
newly diagnosed patients.5,16,17 Importantly, to our knowl-
edge, there have been no systematic comparisons of out-
come according to different definitions of putative refrac-
toriness in a large cohort of patients, nor has the impact of
allogeneic SCT been systematically evaluated.
We have therefore analyzed the outcome of patients
with AML resistant to induction therapy, utilizing differ-
ent definitions of PREF AML, in order to generate diagnos-
tic criteria and examine whether patients genuinely refrac-
tory to IC can be identified earlier in their treatment path-
way. This has allowed us to study the role of allogeneic
SCT in the management of PREF AML - an important but
largely ignored disease entity. 
Methods
We performed a retrospective analysis of patient data on 8907
patients with non-promyelocytic AML treated with intensive
chemotherapy regimens on the MRC/NCRI AML 10, 11, 12, 14,
15 and 16 trials.  The AML 11, 14 and 16 trials were predominant-
ly for older AML patients (>60 years), and their treatment intensity
was reduced compared with trials for younger AML patients. The
trial chemotherapy regimens used have been previously out-
lined,1,18-21 and are summarized in the Online Supplementary Figure
S1. Trials were conducted in accordance with the declaration of
Helsinki, were approved by the Wales multi-center research ethics
committee and participating institutions ethical review commit-
tees, and patients provided written informed consent for their
inclusion in each trial and for the use of their clinical data in the
outcome analysis. Karyotype risk stratification was designated
according to Grimwade et al.22 Bone marrow blasts were analyzed
for FLT3 internal tandem duplications (ITD) and NPM1 mutations
as previously described.1 
Response to IC was assessed by bone marrow evaluation per-
formed 14-21 days after completion of chemotherapy. Complete
response was defined as the presence of less than 5% blasts in the
bone marrow. In patients who failed to achieve a CR after their
first course (C1) of IC response assessment was repeated after a
second course of IC (C2). CR after a second course of IC was
defined as CR occurring within 42 days of commencing C2, or 75
days after trial entry, if the date of administration of C2 was not
available. Patients failing to achieve a CR after two courses of IC
were typically treated off study.  Failure to respond to either the
first or second course of IC was defined according to four defini-
tions of refractoriness, namely: RES: resistant disease with failure
to achieve CR after C1, PR: those deemed to have had a partial
response to IC with failure to achieve CR after C1 and fewer than
15% blasts or a greater than 50% proportional reduction in blast
percentage, REF1: those deemed to have had a minor or no
response to IC with more than 15% blasts and a less than 50%
proportional reduction in blast percentage after C1, and REF2: fail-
ure to achieve CR after two courses of IC (Figure 1). 371 patients
were deemed to be refractory but their blast percentage was not
available, and for the purpose of this analysis these patients were

 classified as PR. Separately, patients fulfilling either REF1 or REF2
criteria were combined and analyzed separately in a compendious
cohort, REF1/2.
Survival in patients fulfilling the different criteria of refractori-
ness was measured from the time at which refractoriness was
ascertained according to the defined criteria. Survival percentages
are measured using the method of Kaplan-Meier, or that of
Mantel-Byar for the analyses of transplant versus not. In comparing
allograft with no transplant, patients receiving other types of
transplant were censored on the date of transplant.  The outcomes
of patients allografted after the year 2000 were analyzed according
to age (greater or less than 50 years), to take into  account the
introduction of reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens in
older patients from this date. Models for risk of refractoriness or
prognosis after being defined as refractory were built using Cox
proportional hazards regression with forward selection; because
molecular data were not uniformly available, this was performed
in 2 stages â first using clinical variables, and then adding the pres-
ence of mutations in the FLT3 or NPM1 genes to the model.

Model without molecular factors
 patients achieved a CR following C1 and there were 879
induction deaths. A total of 2548 patients did not achieve
remission with C1 (RES) of whom 802 fulfilled the criteria
for refractoriness according to definition REF1. Of those
not in CR post C1, 1059 patients achieved a CR after C2,
with 100 patients dying during C2. 473 patients fulfilled
the criteria for REF2. Of 802 patients fulfilling the criteria
for REF1, 204 achieved remission after C2. The total num-
ber of patients who received an allogeneic SCT was 498.
Of these, 351 underwent a myeloablative conditioning
regimen whilst 147 received a RIC regimen. The demo-
graphics of the patients with refractory disease as defined
by these criteria are outlined in the Online Supplementary
Table S1.
Factors predicting resistance to induction 
chemotherapy
The factors determining the presence of refractory dis-
ease after IC, according to the studied definitions, are
summarized in Table 1. Factors common to patients fulfill-
ing REF1, PR and REF2 criteria included the year of diag-
nosis, presentation of white blood cell count (WBC) and
karyotype.
Patient outcomes according to category of refractory
disease
The 5-year OS for patients in RES, REF1 , PR , REF2
and REF1/2 cohorts was 17%, 9%, 21%, 8% and 9%,
respectively, compared with 40% for patients achieving
a CR after one course of IC (P<0.0001). REF1 criteria
identify a distinct sub-population of patients who fail to
achieve CR after course 1, with significantly worse 5-
year OS compared with PR patients (P<0.0001) (Figure
3A). The 5-year OS for REF1 patients (9%) was equiva-
lent to REF2 patients (8%). The 5-year OS for the minor-
ity (204) of REF1  patients who achieved CR with C2 was
markedly reduced compared with patients achieving CR
with their first course of IC (HR 1.39 (1.15-1.69)
P=0.0008) (Figure 3B). 
Factors predicting long term survival in refractory 
disease
The prognostic factors associated with survival for each
of the defined populations with refractory disease are out-
lined in Table 2, and are broadly similar to those which
predicted the presence of refractory disease. Karyotype,
age and performance status were predictive of survival
across all cohorts. When we included the mutational sta-

 tus for FLT3 ITD and NPM1, we found that NPM1 muta-
tions predicted for survival in the REF1 cohort with FLT3
ITD being predictive for survival in the REF1, REF2 and
REF1/2 cohorts.
Identification of treatment factors determining long
term survival
We next studied the impact of allogeneic transplanta-
tion on outcome in the defined groups of primary refrac-
tory disease using a Mantel-Byar approach. Analyses are
presented as Forest plots stratified by age (Figure 4).
Mantel-Byar analysis demonstrated that OS in allografted
patients was significantly improved compared with non-
transplant patients in REF1, REF2 and REF1/2 cohorts,
with roughly equivalent estimates of the hazard ratio for
the benefit of transplantation: REF1 (HR 0.58 (0.46-0.74),
P=0.00001), REF2 (HR 0.55 (0.41-0.74), P=0.0001), and
REF1/2 (HR 0.58 (0.49-0.69), P<0.00001). In the RES
cohort patients over 50 years of age (HR 0.75 (0.62-0.91),
P=0.003), allogeneic transplantation improved survival,
although there was no difference in RES patients under
the age of 50 (HR 1.06 (0.87-1.28), P=0.6; test for interac-
tion P=0.01). When analysis was restricted to PR patients,
there was no benefit for transplantation in either age
group. In the minority of patients in REF1  who achieved
a CR (204/802) with further courses of chemotherapy,
there was a trend towards improved OS after allografting,
but this did not achieve statistical significance (HR 0.77
(0.57-1.05) P=0.09). In patients with REF2 disease survival
after allogeneic transplant was improved in patients who
had achieved a CR with subsequent courses of
chemotherapy (n=49), compared with those transplanted
with active disease (n=37) (38% vs. 17%), although num-
bers were small. In analyses of the REF1/2 group censored
at stem cell transplant, there was no evidence of improve-
ment in survival over time (P=0.3), implying that
improved survival is likely to be related to the use of
transplantation.

 Discussion
This analysis, performed in a large and coherently treat-
ed population of adults, confirms previous reports that
failure to achieve CR after one course of IC is associated
with decreased survival. Furthermore, the presence of
more than 15% blasts and a less than 50% reduction in
blast percentage after the first course of IC identifies a
population of patients whose survival is significantly
worse than those who achieve a CR after course one, and
equivalent to patients who fail to achieve CR after two
courses of IC. Reasoning that the definition of refractori-
ness is failure to achieve long-term survival if treated with
chemotherapy alone, our data support a novel operational
definition of PREF AML based either on a minimal
response to the first course of IC, defined as a less than
50% proportional reduction in blasts and the presence of
more than 15% blasts, or a failure to achieve CR after two
courses of IC. In other words, the outcomes for patients
fulfilling either REF1 or REF2 criteria, if treated with fur-

 ther intensive chemotherapy, is very poor, consistent with
chemorefractoriness. Importantly, our data do not support
the continued use of the RES or PR criteria to define PREF
AML. Our analysis has identified a number of factors
including karyotype, age, sex and diagnostic white cell
count as predicting refractoriness, consistent with previ-
ous studies of high-risk AML. Interestingly, the use of the
MRC risk score designed for risk stratification of younger
patients with AML in conjunction with REF1 criteria iden-
tifies more than 90% of patients within the REF1/2
group.14
Whilst it has been reported that allogeneic SCT may rep-
resent an important treatment modality in patients with
PREF AML, the absence of a consensus concerning the def-
inition of refractory disease and the selection bias inherent
in registry studies has led to skepticism and therapeutic
uncertainty. By applying different definitions of primary
refractoriness it has been possible, for the first time, to
examine the impact of allogeneic transplant in four differ-
ent clinical settings. These data demonstrate that allograft-
ing confers a marked survival advantage in patients fulfill-
ing REF1 and REF2 criteria. There are a number of limita-
tions in the interpretation of our data. Firstly, it is not pos-
sible to quantify the degree to which selection bias con-
tributed to the observed improved outcome in the popula-
tion of patients who proceeded to transplant. Equally, the
impact of an allogeneic transplant may have been underes-
timated because patients often proceeded to transplant
after multiple courses of IC, which has previously been
shown to compromise the outcome of patients allografted
for PREF AML.11,12,23 It is perhaps of no surprise that the out-
come of patients fulfilling REF2 criteria who subsequently
achieved a CR prior to transplant appeared to be improved
compared with those who never achieved CR, but
nonetheless our data demonstrate that allografting repre-
sents the only curative option for a proportion of  REF2
patients; although the degree to which this benefit is
restricted to those who achieve a CR with further
chemotherapy will require further study.  Since time to
transplant is an important predictor of outcome in refracto-
ry AML, the use of REF1 criteria to identify patients with
refractory disease represents an opportunity to improve
transplant outcomes by shortening the time from diagnosis
to transplant. More prosaically, these data also underline
the importance of tissue typing newly diagnosed adult
patients and the commencement of an urgent donor search
as a cornerstone of the management of adult AML. 
An important potential determinant of chemorefractori-
ness in AML is the intensity of induction chemotherapy.
In this study, it was observed that older patients, for
whom lower intensity therapy was felt more appropriate,
were at a higher risk of having refractory disease after two
courses of IC. This underlines the importance of the devel-
opment of either more effective, but well tolerated, novel
chemotherapeutic agents, or improved delivery strategies
such as the use of liposomal preparations.24 This is partic-
ularly pertinent given the higher incidence of PREF AML
in older patients.25 A weakness of this study is that we
have analyzed the outcome in patients treated with stan-
dard doses of induction chemotherapy only, and it will be
important to repeat this analysis in patients receiving high
dose cytosine arabinoside regimens. Our data does, how-
ever, support the further exploration of sequential condi-
tioning regimens which incorporate a cycle of intensive
chemotherapy as an integral component of the preparative
regimen, such as those developed by Kolb and Schmid.12,26
In this context, it is of interest to note the particularly
encouraging results reported by these authors using the
sequential FLAMSA regimen in patients with PREF AML.
Taken together our data support a clarification of the cri-
teria used to define refractoriness to IC in adult AML.
Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of allogeneic
transplantation to improve long-term survival in selected
patients with PREF AML. Adoption of the proposed crite-
ria will assist in the early identification of patients with
PREF AML who have the potential to benefit from allo-
geneic transplantation. Such an approach has the potential
to reduce transplant toxicity and prevent potential selec-
tion of chemotherapy resistant sub-clones.27
