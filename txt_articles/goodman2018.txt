IMPORTANCE Copy number alterations in programmed cell death ligand 1 (PDL1 or CD274),
programmed cell death 1 ligand 2 (PDCD1LG2 or PDL2), and Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) genes
(chromosome 9p24.1) characterize Hodgkin lymphoma, resulting in high response rates to
programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) blockade. The
prevalence and utility of PDL1 amplification as a response biomarker to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade
are unknown in other tumors.
OBJECTIVES To examine the prevalence of PDL1 amplification and its utility as a response
biomarker to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade in solid tumors.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This retrospective study (October 1, 2012, to October 1,
2017) used a deidentified tumor database from a commercial company and annotated clinical
records from a subset of patients treated at a university tertiary referral center. The study
analyzed 118 187 tumors from the deidentified database, including a clinically annotated
subgroup of 2039 malignant tumors.
INTERVENTIONS Comprehensive genomic profiling was performed on all samples to
determine PDL1 amplification, microsatellite instability, and tumor mutational burden (TMB).
A subset of patients was treated with PD-1/PD-L1 blockade.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The prevalence of PDL1 amplification was determined
among 118 187 patient samples that underwent next-generation sequencing. Solid tumors
treated with checkpoint blockade were evaluated for response and progression-free
survival (PFS).
RESULTS Of the 118 187 deidentified tumor samples, PDL1 amplifications were identified in
843 (0.7%), including more than 100 types of solid tumors. Most PDL1-amplified tumors
(84.8%) had a low to intermediate TMB. PDL1 amplification did not always correlate with
high-positive PD-L1 expression by immunohistochemical analysis. Six of 9 patients (66.7%)
from 1 center with PDL1-amplified solid tumors had objective responses after checkpoint
blockade administration. The median PFS among all treated patients was 15.2 months.
Responders included 1 patient with glioblastoma (PFS, �5.2 months), 2 patients with head
and neck squamous cell cancer (PFS, �9 and 15.2 months), 2 patients with metastatic basal
cell cancer (PFS, 3.8 and �24.1 months), and 1 patient with urothelial cancer (PFS, �17.8
months).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The results of this study suggest that PDL1 amplification
occurs in a small subset of malignant tumors. Additional large-scale, prospective studies of
PDL1-amplified cancers are warranted to confirm the responses to checkpoint blockade
described herein, even in the absence of microsatellite instability, high PD-L1 expression,
and a high TMB.

heckpoint blockade with anti–programmed cell death
1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and
anti–cytotoxic T-lymphocyte–associated protein 4
(CTLA4) antibodies has revolutionized the treatment of
solid and hematologic malignant tumors. However, immune
checkpoint inhibitors are only effective in a subset of
patients. Biomarkers for determining response to PD-1/
PD-L1 blockade include PD-L1 expression,1,2 microsatellite
instability (MSI),3 and a high tumor mutational burden
(TMB).4-6
Response rates of 65% to 87% have been reported in
patients with refractory classic Hodgkin lymphoma treated
with checkpoint inhibitors.7,8 In nodular sclerosing Hodgkin
lymphoma, amplification of the chromosomal region
9p24.1, which contains the genes programmed cell death
ligand 1 (PDL1 or CD274) (OMIM 605402), programmed
cell death ligand 2 (PDCD1LG2 or PDL2) (OMIM 605723),
and Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) (OMIM 147796), is directly corre-
lated with increased expression of these proteins on Reed-
Sternberg cells.9 Overall, 105 of 108 biopsy specimens
(97.2%) from patients with newly diagnosed classic Hodgkin
lymphoma10 have had increased PDL1 and PDCD1LG2 copy
numbers. This increase is attributable to 9p24.1 amplifica-
tions, copy number alterations (CNAs), or polysomy of
chromosome 9p. In addition, expression and activation
of JAK2, which is also encoded by a gene residing on the
9p24.1 locus, are increased in Hodgkin lymphoma Reed-
Sternberg cells, further augmenting transcription of the
PDL1 gene.9
The CNAs of the 9p24.1 locus have also been detected in
63% of primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphomas and
50% of primary central nervous system large B-cell lympho-
mas and are associated with high PD-L1 and PD-L2 expres-
sion on immunohistochemical analysis.9,11,12 Recently, a
study13 found that all 5 patients with relapsed or refractory
primary central nervous system large B-cell lymphoma or
testicular large B-cell lymphoma treated with PD-1 blockade
experienced an objective response, and 60% remained pro-
gression free at 13 to 17 months. Taken together, in certain
lymphomas, chromosome 9p24.1 alterations, which include
PDL1, are relatively common and are associated with high
susceptibility to PD-1 blockade.
In contrast, data are limited regarding PDL1 amplifica-
tions in solid tumors. To date, such amplifications have
only been detected in small studies of head and neck squa-
mous cell carcinoma,14 cervical squamous cell carcinoma,15
triple-negative breast cancer,16-18 and non–small cell
lung cancer.19 Consistent with the aforementioned data
on lymphomas, recent case reports found responses
to PD-1 blockade in patients with PDL1-amplified,
microsatellite-stable colon cancer20 and metastatic basal
cell carcinoma,21 suggesting the need for further interroga-
tion of the potential utility of PDL1 amplifications as a bio-
marker for immune checkpoint blockade response. We
describe, to our knowledge, the largest cohort of tumor
samples (N = 118 187) evaluated for PDL1 CNAs and report
the frequency of PDL1 amplification across a variety of
solid tumors.

Profiling and Assessment of PDL1 Amplification,
MSI, and TMB
Comprehensive Genomic Profiling and PDL1 (CD274) Assessment
Comprehensive genomic profiling was performed using the
FoundationOne and FoundationOneHeme assay (Founda-
tion Medicine), as previously described in detail.24,25 In brief,
the pathologic diagnosis of each case was confirmed by re-
view of hematoxylin-eosin–stained slides, and all samples that
advanced to DNA extraction contained a minimum of 20% tu-
mor cells. The fail rate was approximately 1%. Hybridization
capture of exonic regions from 315, 327, or 405 cancer-
related genes was applied to 50 ng or more of DNA extracted
from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded cancer specimens.
These libraries were sequenced to high, uniform median cov-
erage (>500 times) and assessed for base substitutions, short
insertions and deletions, CNAs, and gene fusions and rear-
rangements. Sequencing was performed from October 1, 2012,
to October 1, 2017.24 PDL1 amplification was performed for
6 or more CNAs.
TMB Evaluation

Key Points
Question What is the prevalence and utility of programmed cell
death ligand 1 (PDL1) gene amplification as a response biomarker
to programmed cell death/programmed cell death ligand 1
blockade in solid tumors?
Findings In this study of 118 187 tumor samples from a
deidentified database, including a subset of 2039 samples from a
clinically annotated database, the prevalence of PDL1 amplification
was 0.7%. The objective response rate for patients with solid
tumors that harbored PDL1 amplification was 66.7%, with a
median progression-free survival of 15.2 months.
Meaning The results of this study suggest that PDL1 amplification
occurs in a small subset of malignant tumors; however, testing for
this alteration may be warranted because of the frequent and
durable responses to programmed cell death/programmed cell
death ligand 1 blockade.

 algorithm.26 Alterations likely or known to be oncogenic driv-
ers and germline polymorphisms were excluded. A TMB of
5 mutations per megabase or more was designated as low;
6 to 19, intermediate; and 20 or more, high.
MSI Assessment
The MSI status was calculated using 114 loci determined to be
useful in detecting evidence of polymerase slippage and there-
fore MSI.27 The information from these loci were then used in
principal component analysis to produce an MSI score. Ranges
of MSI scores were assigned as high MSI (MSI-H), microsatel-
lite stable, or intermediate or ambiguous MSI.
Database Analysis for PDL1 Amplification and TMB
To understand the large-scale prevalence of PDL1 amplifica-
tion and its relevant associations, we analyzed 118 187 patient
samples with cancer from the Foundation Medicine deiden-
tified database. Only patients with chromosome 9p24.1 altera-
tions in PDL1, PDL2, and/or JAK2 alterations were further re-
viewed (eFigure 1 in Supplement 1 and Supplement 2). We
focused on patients with solid tumors.
Patient and Sample Selection
ToretrievedatathatwouldprovideclinicalcorrelationsofPDL1
CNAs with checkpoint inhibitor response, we evaluated 2039
consecutive cancer samples from patients at the UCSD Moores
Center for Personalized Cancer Therapy (October 1, 2012, to
October 1, 2017). All patients had undergone comprehensive
genomic profiling (Foundation Medicine; https://www
.foundationmedicine.com/).
Pathology for TILs and Immunohistochemistry
for PD-L1
Tumor samples, when available, were reviewed by a patholo-
gist (H.-Y.W.) for enumeration of tumor-infiltrating lympho-
cytes (TILs) as described by Salgado et al.28,29 The mean per-
centage of TILs was quantified from evaluating 3 high-power
fields (original magnification, ×400). Macrophages were ex-
cluded from the TIL count. Immunohistochemical analysis for
PD-L1 expression was performed using commercially avail-
able assays (eTable 1 and eTable 2 in Supplement 1).
Outcomes
Responses were assessed based on Response Evaluation Cri-
teria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria.30 Progression-free sur-
vival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were calculated using the
Kaplan-Meier method (P values by log-rank test) (starting from
the first day of immunotherapy). The PFS and OS are cen-
sored at the date that the patient was last seen provided that
the patient’
s cancer had not progressed (for PFS) and the pa-
tient had not died (for OS).
Statistical Analysis
The Fisher exact test was used to assess categorical variables.
Bonferroni correction was applied as a multitesting correc-
tion. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad
Prism, version 7.0. A 2-sided P ≤ .05 and Q ≤ .05 were consid-
ered to be statistically significant.
Results
Patient Characteristics
Overall, 843 of 118 187 patient samples (0.7%) that had under-
gone comprehensive genomic profiling had 6 or more CNAs
in PDL1 (Table). A total of 405 gene panels were performed on
15 982 tumor samples, 327 gene panels on 450 tumor samples,
and 315 gene panels on 101 755 tumor samples. PDL1 amplifi-
cation was identified in 88 samples from the 405 gene pan-
els, 5 samples from the 327 gene panels, and 750 samples from
the 315 gene panels (total of 843 samples). PDL1 CNAs
were identified in more than 100 solid tumor histologic types
(eTable 3 in Supplement 1). The tumor type with the highest
percentage of PDL1 amplification was mixed hepatocellular
cholangiocarcinoma (10.5% of samples). Solid tumors with a
significantly increased percentage of PDL1 amplification in-
cluded breast carcinoma (111 [1.9%]; P < .001), head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma (39 [3.1%]; P < .001), lung squa-
mouscellcarcinoma(50[1.7%];P < .001),undifferentiatedsoft-
tissue sarcoma (13 [3.9%]; P < .001), thyroid anaplastic carci-
noma (9 [5.1%]; P < .001), unknown primary squamous cell
carcinoma (16 [2.0%]; P = .01), nasopharyngeal carcinoma (5
[5.1%]; P = .03), and kidney sarcomatoid carcinoma (4 [6.1%];
P = .04) (Table). Neoplasms notable for having a lower fre-
quencyofPDL1CNAsincludedcolorectal,pancreatic,andpros-
tate cancer and melanoma (Table).
TMB and MSI
The mean TMB for PDL1-amplified tumors was 13.3 muta-
tions per megabase, and the median was 6.3 mutations per
megabase. For unamplified tumors, the mean was 7.4 muta-
tions per megabase and the median was 3.6 mutations per
megabase (eTable 3 in Supplement 1). Overall, 128 PDL1-
amplified tumors (15.2%) were classified as having high
TMB compared with 7510 unamplified tumors (6.4%). Most
PDL1-amplified tumors had a low to intermediate TMB
(84.8%). For some tumors (ie, kidney sarcomatoid carci-
noma [n = 4], pancreas ductal carcinoma [n = 1], and pros-
tate cancer [n = 5]), 100% of PDL1-amplified tumors had a
low TMB (≤5 mutations per megabase). The MSI-H and PDL1
amplification were not mutually exclusive. Five of 741
patients (0.7%) with PDL1 amplification (2 gastrointestinal
tumors and 3 carcinomas of unknown primary) who were
tested for microsatellite status were MSI-H; 1435 of 103 373
patients (1.4%) who did not have PDL1 amplification and
were tested for microsatellite status were MSI-H. In the
UCSD cohort (n = 13), the median TMB for PDL1-amplified
tumors was 9 mutations per megabase vs 4 mutations per
megabase for non–PDL1-amplified tumors (P = .007). Nine of
the 13 patients (69.2%) had an intermediate to high TMB,
whereas 4 patients (30.8%) had a low TMB (1-5 mutations
per megabase). Finally, 11 of 13 tumors (84.6%) tested for
MSI were stable.
Clinical Characteristics of the Cohort With PDL1 CNAs
Thirteen patients were identified with PDL1 CNAs from the
2039 patients who had undergone comprehensive genomic

 profiling (eTable 4 and eFigure 1 in Supplement 1). All 13
patients had coamplification of PDCD1LG2 (PDL2), and all
but 1 (92.3%) had coamplification of JAK2. All 13 (100%) had
locally advanced (3 [23.1%]) or metastatic (10 [76.9%]) dis-
ease (2 with hematologic malignant tumors and 11 with solid
tumors). The median time alive with locally advanced or
metastatic disease was 26.5 months (range, 7.9-65.5
months). Nine different malignant tumors were identified
that harbored PDL1 CNAs, including head and neck tumors
(3 patients) and a glioblastoma (eTable 4 in Supplement 1).
Nine patients (69.2%) (all with solid tumors) received
therapy with a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor.
Genomics, PD-L1 Expression, and TILs
in the Cohort With PDL1 CNAs
A total of 70 genes with 143 alterations were identified among
the 13 patients with PDL1 CNAs (Figure 1 and eTable 5 in
Supplement 1). Among the 13 patients, only 5 samples from 5
patients were available for pathologic evaluation for TILs (4
of them were stromal TILs and 1 [B-cell lymphoma] was intra-
tumoral TILs). The TILs ranged from a mean of 10% to 60%
per high-power field (original magnification, ×400). Four
of 6 tumors (66.7%) tested expressed PD-L1 (immunohisto-
chemical analysis) (eTable 1 in Supplement 1). Of note, one pa-
tient with glioblastoma and another patient with metastatic

Additional Alterations in PDL1 and PDCD1L2G (PDL2)
Eleven (0.001%) of the 118 187 samples harbored PDL1 exon 7
truncations. Two individuals in the UCSD cohort had other al-
terations that involved PDL1 and PDCD1LG2 (eTable 6 in
Supplement1).Onepatienthadmetastaticheadandnecksqua-
mous cell carcinoma that harbored a PDL1 exon 7 truncation.

The patient achieved a partial response to treatment with dur-
valumab, a PD-L1 inhibitor. The other patient had metastatic
cholangiocarcinoma with a PKD1P1-PDCD1LG2 rearrange-
ment (but was not treated with checkpoint blockade). This al-
teration was not identified in any of the other 118 186 samples.
Response to Checkpoint Blockade
Nine of the 13 patients (69.2%) with PDL1 amplification were
treated with checkpoint blockade (all solid tumors) (eTable 5
in Supplement 1). The median number of prior therapies in
these 9 patients was 4 (range, 1-7). Five patients were treated
with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor monotherapy, 3 with a PD-1/PD-L1
inhibitorplusaninvestigationalagent,and1withanti–PD-1and
anti-CTLA4combinationtherapy.Theresponseratewas66.7%.
The median PFS among the 9 patients was 15.2 months (range,
1.6 to ≥24.1 months); median OS was not reached from the start
of checkpoint blockade (range, 1.6 to ≥24.1 months) (Figure 2).
Responders included 1 patient with glioblastoma (PFS, ≥5.2
months), 2 patients with head and neck squamous cell cancer
(PFS, ≥9 and 15.2 months), 2 patients with metastatic basal cell
cancer (PFS, 3.8 and ≥24.1 months), and 1 patient with uro-
thelial cancer (PFS, ≥17.8 months). In addition, a patient with
primary mediastinal lymphoma that was refractory to chemo-
therapy, including high-dose chemotherapy followed by au-
tologous stem cell rescue, had an ongoing complete response
to allogeneic stem cell transplantation at 24.1 months.
One patient had progressive glioblastoma after tumor re-
section followed by adjuvant radiation therapy with concur-
rent temozolamide.32 Comprehensive genomic profiling iden-
tified 12 characterized alterations, including PDL1, PDCD1LG2,
and JAK2 amplifications. MET protooncogene (MET) (OMIM
164860) and mouse double minute homolog 2 (MDM2) (OMIM
164785) amplifications were also identified. The case was pre-
sented at the molecular tumor board, and treatment with
checkpoint inhibition was debated because of the presence of
MDM2 amplification, which has been associated with
hyperprogression.33 However, because of the grave progno-
sis of glioblastoma, the patient was prescribed combination
therapy with nivolumab and the MET inhibitor cabozantinib
(after signing consent for an institutional review board–
approved protocol [Study of Molecular Profile-Related Evi-
dence to Determine Individualized Therapy for Advanced
or Poor Prognosis Cancers (I-PREDICT)23]). Brain magnetic
resonance imaging (eFigure 2 in Supplement 1) performed
4 weeks after therapy initiation demonstrated a partial re-
sponse with decreased enhancement within the primary mass

 nivolumab (weeks 11-23) were given secondary to the devel-
opment of a transaminitis. Subsequent brain magnetic reso-
nance imaging demonstrated an improving and ongoing
response at 5.2 months.
Discussion
In our study, the prevalence of PDL1 CNAs in a large cohort of
diverse tumors was 0.7%. These alterations were identified in
asmallsubsetofmultiplesolidtumortypes,includingrareneo-
plasms, such as bladder squamous cell carcinoma, undiffer-
entiated soft-tissue sarcomas, and sarcomatoid renal cell car-
cinoma. Furthermore, we found that PDL1 CNAs can be
associated with responses to checkpoint blockade across a di-
verse spectrum of tumors (eTable 4 in Supplement 1) . Six of
9 patients (66.7%) with PDL1 amplification responded to im-
munotherapy vs 45 of 151 patients (29.8%) in the overall UCSD-
treated cohort (P = .03).5
Althoughrareoutsidecertainlymphomas,identificationof
amplifications in PDL1 is important because this subset of tu-
mors appears to have a high likelihood of responding to check-
point blockade. This situation is analogous to that in patients
withlungcancerthatharborsanaplasticlymphomakinase(ALK)
(OMIM 105590) and V-ROS avian UR2 sarcoma virus oncogene
homolog 1 ROS1 (OMIM 165020) alterations, which both con-
fer sensitivity to ALK inhibitors.34,35 Regarding histologic ag-
nostic responsiveness, MSI-H confers response to checkpoint
inhibitorsacrosscancersandneurotrophictyrosinereceptorki-
nase fusions respond to neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase
targeting in a tissue-agnostic fashion.3,36
Infection has been implicated in certain types of neo-
plasms identified to have a higher prevalence of PDL1 ampli-
fications. These neoplasms include bladder squamous cell
carcinoma associated with Schistosoma hematobium, naso-
pharyngealcarcinoma,Epstein-Barrvirus,headandnecksqua-
mous cell carcinoma, human papillomavirus, and mixed cel-
lularityvariantofHodgkinlymphoma,whichisassociatedwith
Epstein-Barr infection.37 Viral-associated malignant neo-
plasms may be susceptible to tumor immune responses, per-
haps through upregulation of APOBEC (apolipoprotein B mes-
senger RNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like), a
family of cytidine deaminases that help protect from viral in-
fections.APOBECupregulationinturncorrelateswithhighlev-
els of PD-L1.2,38 It is plausible that these tumors are using PDL1
amplification as a mechanism of immune escape from an en-
dogenous immune response.
Sarcomatoid renal cell carcinoma (6.5% of which had PDL1
amplification—oneofthehighestratesforsolidtumors)(Table)
isararesubtypeofrenalcellcarcinoma.Althoughonlyaccount-
ing for approximately 5% of renal cell carcinomas, the aggres-
sivenatureofthisvariantresultsinmanypatientshavingmeta-
static disease at diagnosis.39 In addition, these tumors are
responsivetocheckpointblockadeatleastinasmallseries,with
2 of 6 patients achieving objective response to atezolizumab
(PD-L1 inhibitor).40 PD-L1 expression in sarcomatoid renal cell
carcinoma appears to be higher compared with standard renal
cell carcinoma without sarcomatoid differentiation.41
Glioblastoma is a lethal tumor with limited effective treat-
ment options. Outside MSI-H glioblastoma, checkpoint block-
ade has not been effective.42 In this report, we demonstrate,
for the first time to our knowledge, a response to nivolumab
in a PDL1-amplified glioblastoma.
ExpressionofPD-L1wasidentifiedbyimmunohistochemi-
cal analysis in 4 of 6 patients who were tested. Of interest,
2 of the patients who lacked PD-L1 protein expression (1 with
glioblastomaand1withmetastaticbasalcellcarcinoma)(eTable
5 in Supplement 1) responded to PD-1 blockade. A recent
report14 in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma also found
that PDL1 CNAs were concordant with PD-L1 expression by im-
munohistochemical analysis only 73% of the time. Presence
of gene amplification with no or low-level PD-L1 protein ex-

 pression should make immune checkpoint blockade inhibi-
tors less effective. Posttranscriptional splicing and methyla-
tion could be mechanisms that limit expression. However,
insufficient sampling of tumor and other technical problems
with immunohistochemical analysis, in part related to tumor
heterogeneityandthepresenceofstromaorattributabletodif-
ferences in affinity of distinct anti–PD-L1 antibodies, may limit
the accuracy of the protein expression methods and may ex-
plainresponsesinpatientswholackedPD-L1expressiononim-
munohistochemical analysis. Other mechanisms, such as ex-
pression of PD-L2 rather than PD-L1, may also be operative
when patients respond to anti-PD1 agents in the absence of
PD-L1 expression (because PD-L1 and PD-L2 interact with
PD-1).43 All these issues merit in-depth exploration in larger
cohorts of treated patients to better understand the associa-
tion among PD-L1 expression, PDL1 amplification, and re-
sponse to checkpoint blockade.
Of interest, in addition to the 13 patients in the UCSD
cohort who had PDL1 amplification, 2 patients harbored al-
terations that involved PDL1 and PDCD1LG2 (eTable 4 in
Supplement 1) that were not CNAs. The first alteration, a PDL1
exon 7 truncation, is predicted to disrupt the 3′ untranslated
region of PDL1. Similar alterations have been observed in many
tumor types and correlate with increased PD-L1 expression,
presumablyvialossofinhibitorymicroRNAbindingsites.31,44,45
This patient achieved a partial response that lasted 9 months
with a durvalumab (anti–PD-L1)–based regimen. The other al-
teration, with a PKD1P1-PDCD1LG2 rearrangement, has not
been previously reported or characterized. However, translo-
cations that involve PDCD1LG2 and numerous partners have
been highly characterized in primary mediastinal large B-cell
lymphoma and result in increased PD-L2 expression.2
Limitations
The small number of patients precludes definitive conclu-
sions regarding response rates, PFS, or OS except to suggest
that further additional prospective clinical trials of check-
point blockade in PDL1-amplified cancers are warranted. In ad-
dition,thecurrentassaywasvalidatedfor6ormorecopynum-
bers of PDL1, and future studies should determine the
frequency of CNAs that are less than 6. This study also did not
assess features of the tumor microenvironment, such as the
presence of transforming growth factor β, which can have pro-
found influences on the response to checkpoint blockade.46,47
Thus, application of checkpoint blockade and comparison to
standard-of-carechemotherapyrequireproperlydesignedran-
domized clinical trials with both PFS and OS end points.
Conclusions
Our data suggest that PDL1 CNAs are found in a small sub-
group of diverse solid tumors and may correlate with
responses to checkpoint blockade. Additional prospective
studies are needed to validate this finding and to determine
whether routine testing for this alteration is warranted.
