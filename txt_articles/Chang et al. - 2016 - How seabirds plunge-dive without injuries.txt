In nature, several seabirds (e.g., gannets and boobies) dive into wa-
ter at up to 24 m/s as a hunting mechanism; furthermore, gannets
and boobies have a slender neck, which is potentially the weakest
part of the body under compression during high-speed impact. In
this work, we investigate the stability of the bird’s neck during
plunge-diving by understanding the interaction between the fluid
forces acting on the head and the flexibility of the neck. First, we
use a salvaged bird to identify plunge-diving phases. Anatomical
features of the skull and neck were acquired to quantify the effect
of beak geometry and neck musculature on the stability during a
plunge-dive. Second, physical experiments using an elastic beam as
a model for the neck attached to a skull-like cone revealed the limits
for the stability of the neck during the bird’s dive as a function of
impact velocity and geometric factors. We find that the neck length,
neck muscles, and diving speed of the bird predominantly reduce the
likelihood of injury during the plunge-dive. Finally, we use our re-
sults to discuss maximum diving speeds for humans to avoid injury.

N
ature contains several species of creatures that interact with
the air–water interface (1). A number of bird species are able
to dive into water from the air as a hunting mechanism (e.g.,
kingfishers, terns, and gannets), a behavior known as plunge-diving
(2, 3). Some seabirds, like the northern gannet, are highly spe-
cialized plunge-divers, making 20–100 dives per foraging trip, div-
ing from heights of 5–45 m, and attaining speeds of more than
20 m/s (4–7). Thus, the bird’s structure and behavior have pre-
sumably evolved to withstand a variety of high dynamic stresses,
because no injuries have been reported in plunge-diving seabirds.
Biologists have previously focused on the diving behavior in terms
of ecological factors, such as diving depths, prey species, and
hunting success rate (8–10), and physiological features, such as the
role of vision while crossing the air–water interface (11, 12). Unique
kinematic and morphological features during the dive have also
been observed, such as having a sharp, arrow-like body posture and
a straight, long, and slender neck (13, 14). However, a mechanical
understanding of plunge-diving birds is not well-established.
To study such a phenomenon, Morus bassanus (hereafter gan-
nets) and Sula leucogaster (hereafter boobies), from the Sulidae
family, are used as a model species due to their highly specialized
diving characteristics (5, 13). First, they plunge-dive at very high
speeds, using that momentum to carry them to some depth. Then,
they use their webbed feet and/or wings to propel themselves fur-
ther underwater, like penguins and cormorants (15, 16). Although
plunge-diving at high speeds allows the bird to dive deeper, it in-
duces much larger stresses on the seabird’s body than pursuit diving
alone (13). The two main forms of plunge-diving observed are
known as the V-shaped dive and the U-shaped dive (5). During
V-shaped dives, the seabird impacts the surface at an angle,
whereas during U-shaped dives the impact trajectory is more
perpendicular to the surface (14, 17). Although the mechanical
forces may differ between the two dives, both U-shaped and V-
shaped dives experience an axial force significantly larger than
a transverse force. Therefore, this present study focuses on the
U-shaped dive, which is a model for understanding the effect of
an axial force on the risk of a buckling neck.
From a mechanics standpoint, an axial force acting on a slender
body may lead to mechanical failure on the body, otherwise known
as buckling. Therefore, under compressive loads, the neck is po-
tentially the weakest part of the northern gannet due to its long
and slender geometry. Still, northern gannets impact the water at
up to 24 m/s without injuries (18) (see SI Appendix, Table S1 for
estimated speeds). The only reported injuries from plunge-diving
occur from bird-on-bird collisions (19). However, for humans,
diving into water at speeds greater than 26 m/s risks severe frac-
tures in the cervical or thoracic vertebrae and speeds greater than
30 m/s risk death, regardless of impact orientation (20–26). Un-
derstanding the bird plunge-dive may further explain methods of
injury prevention in human diving.
In this present study, we investigate how birds are able to dive
at high speeds and sustain no injury, given the morphology of the
head and neck. Due to its long, slender geometry, the seabird’s
neck is the region with the greatest potential for mechanical
failure or instability under high dynamic loading. In reduced-
order experiments, we simplify the seabird system as a long, thin,
elastic beam attached to a rigid cone, which represent the bird’s
neck and head, respectively. By modeling the bird’s neck as an
elastic beam, we can use the buckling and nonbuckling behaviors
of the elastic beam to represent the stability of the seabird’s
neck. A linear stability analysis is used to obtain a theoretical
prediction of the buckling transition. The effect of neck muscles
is discussed in terms of modifying the buckling criterion. We then
show that plunge-diving seabirds have a unique morphology,
appropriate diving speeds, and strong neck muscles that will al-
low them to dive safely at high speeds.
Results
Plunge-Diving Seabirds. To characterize the plunge-diving mecha-
nism of seabirds, a salvaged northern gannet is prepared in the
diving posture and is released into a water tank as shown in Fig. 1A
(Materials and Methods). Upon water entry, in which momentum
Significance
Plunge-diving is a very unique foraging method in the animal
kingdom. A limited set of water birds exhibit this behavior, and
only one family of seabirds (Sulidae) exhibit this behavior at high
speeds. We studied the stability of the bird’s slender and seemingly
fragile neck during a plunge-dive by conducting simple experi-
ments that mimic this behavior. An elegant analysis of the in-
teraction among hydrodynamic forces, neck elasticity, and muscle
contraction reveals that seabirds dive at appropriate speeds to
avoid injury. Considering the popular recreational sport of diving,
we also find a diving speed limit for humans to avoid injury.

 carries the bird through the water (11), three different phases be-
come apparent: (i) the impact phase, (ii) the air cavity phase, and
(iii) the submerged phase, which is characteristic of a classic water
entry problem (27). The impact phase occurs when the tip of the
beak first makes contact with the water surface until the head
becomes submerged (t < Hhead=V; Hhead is the head length and V is
the diving speed at impact). The air cavity phase occurs between
the head’s being submerged until the seabird’s chest makes contact
with the water surface [t < ðHhead + LneckÞ=V; Lneck is the neck
length, which is also close Hhead]. The submerged phase occurs
after the bird’s chest impacts the water, closing the air cavity.
The air cavity phase [Hhead=V < t < ðHhead + LneckÞ=V] is the
most interesting because it provides the greatest potential for
neck injuries during the plunge-dive. During the air cavity phase,
the head is subjected to hydrodynamic forces causing the head
to decelerate while the rest of the body continues to descend
downward. This results in an axial compressive load on the neck.
Once the chest makes contact with the water in the submerged
phase, the compressive load on the neck will be alleviated due to
the hydrodynamic force on the chest.

namic drag to the neck’s elasticity [η = ρfV 2R2

of the overall neck, and I is the area moment of inertia of the
neck; Materials and Methods and SI Appendix, Fig. S1] is about
4.7 for birds diving at a speed of 24 m/s. This simple scaling
analysis shows that the drag force may exceed the compliance of
the neck, potentially leading to injuries. However, for a better
assessment of the neck stability, we need to examine the effect of
head shape and neck muscles.
Physical Experiment to Mimic Plunge-Diving. To further explore this
fluid–neck interaction, we design a reduced-order experiment by
approximating the neck (a composition of bone, muscle, and
skin) as an elastic beam and the head as a rigid cone. A cone–
beam system was fabricated to effectively model the head–neck
interaction during impact (Materials and Methods). Various
geometric parameters (i.e., cone angle, cone radius, and beam
length) and impact velocities were tested, producing a range of
drag to elasticity ratio to be η = Oð10−2 − 102Þ, which encom-
passes the drag to elasticity ratio value for plunge-diving birds.
Fig. 2A shows the dynamics of a cone–beam specimen remaining
stable through the air cavity phase, Hcone=V < t < 2Hcone=V. Fig. 2B
shows a specimen with a longer beam length becoming unstable
through the air cavity phase. The effect of other parameters (cone
angle, velocity, and length) on the stability of the beam can be seen
in SI Appendix, Fig. S2. In general, an increase in velocity and beam
length will increase the likelihood of buckling.
Forces on Cone or Head. Hydrodynamic drag is the main force
that acts on the cone during impact. When the cone first enters
the water (during the impact phase), the drag force is primarily
induced by a change in added mass. Hence, the drag force

air cavity phase occurs between the head’s being submerged up until the seabird’s chest makes contact with the water surface. The submerged phase occurs
when the bird’s chest impacts the water, closing the air cavity. Note that the head length (Hhead) and the neck length (Lneck) are approximately the same.

β is the cone half-angle, Rcone is the cone radius, and zðtÞ is the
distance between the cone tip and the free surface (Materials and
Methods). Here, the drag coefficient, Cd, is chosen to be 2/3 as a
fitting parameter. Smaller cone angles will reduce the hydrody-
namic drag forces during the impact phase, but during the air cavity
phase the hydrostatic pressure will increase more rapidly due to the
larger cone height.

and

respectively.
The
measured force initially rises parabolically during the impact phase
due to the strong time dependence in FDragðt < Hcone=VÞ. At later
times (t ≥ Hcone=V), the drag force becomes constant. However,
the hydrostatic pressure force linearly increases during the air
cavity phase, which is predicated by the analytical models dis-
cussed above. So, when the cone has a larger cone height and
impacts at a low speed, the hydrostatic pressure force plays a
larger role because more time is needed for the cone to reach
~
T = 2. Shorter cone heights with higher speeds are less affected by
FHydr at ~
T = 2.
Next, we consider the force on a 3D-printed skull of a northern
gannet. Based on the geometry of the skull, three distinct sections
are identified (Fig. 1B and SI Appendix, Fig. S3). The first section
is between the tip of the beak to its base, where a hinge [naso-
frontal hinge (28)] runs along the dorso between the beak and the
forehead (Fig. 1); the second section is between the naso-frontal
hinge and small protrusions near the back of the skull (zygomatic
process of the Os squamosum); the third section is between the
protrusions and the end of the skull (Prominentia cerebellaris)
(29). Assuming that the skull is two cones of different angles in
tandem, the force measurement during the impact phase shows
two distinct time-dependent curves as predicted by our analytical
expression described above (Fig. 3B). This result indicates that the
axial force acting on the neck of the plunge-diving bird increases
with the skull radius, the impact velocity, and, most importantly,
the beak angle.
Transition to Buckling. The transition from stable to unstable
beams depends on the impact velocity, geometric factors, and
material properties of the beam and the cone. The critical
compressive force to buckle the beam is calculated from a linear
stability analysis resulting in the dispersion relation. In order for
the beam to buckle, the highest growth rate at some given time
must lie in the unstable region (Fig. 4A), in our case non-
dimensional wavenumber greater than π (kL ≥ π) (30, 31). In
other words, buckling only occurs when the most unstable
wavelength is shorter than the beam length. At the moment of
the fully submerged neck (t = 2Hhead=V, or ~
T = 2), we obtain a
buckling criterion based on the spatial condition for the beam as

 the stability of the beam under various conditions, and is in good
agreement with experimental data.
Using morphological and material properties obtained from
the salvaged bird, we find that the plunge-diving birds dive in the
stable region of the transition diagram. However, this analysis
neglects the effects of the neck muscles, which leads to another
question addressed in the next section. What role does the neck
musculature play in preventing neck injuries during the plunge-
diving behavior?
Effect of Muscles. The motion and strength of an animal’s neck
result from the coupling between bone and muscles (32, 33). The
total force generated by the muscle bundle will depend on the
length and cross-sectional area of muscle fibers. Neck muscles in
plunge-diving birds are mostly concentrated near the head and
the thorax of the bird, as shown in Fig. 4C. The muscles connect
the body, the vertebrae, and the skull by a series of thin muscle
sheets and tendons (34). Additionally, the necks of gannets and
boobies, similar to those of other birds, have an S shape, due to
their vertebrae morphology and connecting design (34, 35), in-
creasing the complexity of biomechanical analysis. One may note
that the S shape would serve as a primary mode of buckling in
the neck. However, the fact is that the musculature plays an
important role in stabilizing a straight neck as a whole, and also
maintaining the S shape of the spine. Therefore, we simplified
the complex network of muscles using segmentation and re-
construction of computed tomography (CT) images of the lat-
eral, dorsal, and ventral musculature (Fig. 4C). By muscle
contraction, the tendons put some stabilizing tension on the
bones, straightening the neck out and fixing the bones into place
before the impact. We approximate the effect of the muscles as a
continuously distributed load acting tangentially along the neck
(Fig. 4D) (36). The muscle force fmuscle per cross-sectional area is
estimated by measuring the cross-sectional area of the neck
muscles in CT-scanned images (37). Then, we find that a
resisting bending force is modified as FBend = ð2π2EIÞ1=3f 2=3
muscle
due to the contracting muscle force. In our stability analysis, the
inclusion of the muscle force will place the plunge-diving birds
higher in the transition diagram, thus further away from the
buckling transition line. The critical impact force to overcome
this modified muscle/bending force was estimated to be 3.4 kN,
which is two orders of magnitude higher than the 30 N produced
by the combined hydrostatic and drag force, thus allowing the
bird to dive safely at high speeds.
Discussion
The results help to reveal the mechanisms (in addition to visual
accommodations) by which plunge-diving birds are able to dive
at incredibly high speeds with no injuries (19). This is primarily
attributed to the neck length and chosen diving speeds, which
stay in parameter regimes that prevent the neck from bending
under compressive loads. The neck muscles move plunge-divers
further away from the buckling transition. In fact, it would take
about 80 m/s for the plunge-diving seabird to sustain a neck in-
jury based on our analysis.
Furthermore, this study may elucidate safe diving speeds for
humans. We consider feet-first dives, which gives a higher sur-
vival rate (20). Human feet are flat with large surface areas;
average foot areas for males and females are 0.06 and 0.05 m2
(38), respectively. At a diving speed of 24 m/s, the compressive
force that a human would experience is about 14 kN, which well
exceeds a range of maximum compressive forces (0.3–17 kN) to
cause neck injury (39). The impact force exceeds the critical
maximum compressive force (17 kN) at a diving speed of about
24 m/s (for trained individuals, i.e., stunt divers). This critical
diving speed is consistent with the maximum speed (≈26 m/s) for
spinal fractures reported in case studies (SI Appendix, Table S2).
Materials and Methods
Salvaged Bird. A salvaged northern gannet (M. bassanus) was obtained for
analysis. The elastic modulus of the neck (E ’ 8.6 MPa) was determined based
on the neck’s curvature from an applied load (SI Appendix, Fig. S1B). The bird
was then frozen in a position so that the neck was extended straight. To
understand morphological properties, the frozen bird was CT-scanned
(Toshiba Aquilion 16; 100 kVp, 125 mA, 0.5-mm slice thickness, 512× 512
reconstruction matrix) and the resulting images provided us with the neck
length (Lneck ’ 21 cm), neck and head radius (Rneck ’ 2 cm and Rhead ’ 2.5 cm),
and skull angle (β = 11°) (reconstruction and visualization of images were done
using Horos open-source software, v. 1.0.7, https://www.horosproject.org/).
Therefore, the bending rigidity becomes EI ’ 1.1 N ·m2. Segmentation and
reconstruction of the skeleton and musculature of the neck were done using
Mimics software (Materialise NV), providing the cross-section areas for the
muscle force calculations. The frozen bird was then subjected to a series of
drop tests into a tank of water. High-speed footages of the impact, air cavity,
and submerged phases were acquired.
Skull Specimens. Several skull specimens for different species of gannets and
boobies were acquired from the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History
(M. bassanus, n = 14; Morus capensis, n = 5; Morus serrator, n = 2; Sula
dactylatra, n = 2; Sula sula, n = 3; and S. leucogaster, n = 3). Two distinct
regions are noted: (i) between the tip of the beak to the naso-frontal hinge

hinge to the zygomatic process (from the squamous bone) with β2 = 12.3° ±
0.8°. The average skull radius was measured to be 2.4 ± 0.3 cm. Details of
measurements can be seen in SI Appendix, Fig. S3.
Muscle Cross-Sectional Area. The northern gannet’s neck musculature was di-
vided in dorsal, ventral, and lateral (Fig. 4C; red for dorsal muscle and yellow
for ventral muscle). Mesh masks were created using threshold selection
(Hounsfield unit: −140, 299) and cleaned for segmentation and reconstruction
in Mimics program. To measure the cross-sectional area of the dorsal and
ventral musculature, the neck was divided in anterior (five vertebrae close to
the skull) and posterior (vertebrae 9–14, closer to the thorax) portions; ver-
tebrae 6–8 comprise the midsection of the S-shaped neck. After segmentation,
seven points along the anterior and posterior portions of the neck were se-
lected to extract the cross-sectional area measurements. Mask area measure-
ments (square millimeters) of 10 sequential slice images were averaged for
each of the seven points. Values from the seven points were averaged
(anterior musculature: ventral, 195.87 ± 41.22 mm2 and dorsal, 319.21 ±
186.78 mm2; posterior musculature: ventral, 88.79 ± 23.76 mm2 and dorsal,
181.40 ± 68.44 mm2) to determine musculature forces to avoid neck buckling.
Physical Experiment. To simulate the plunge-diving seabird’s head–neck
coupling, a cone–beam system was developed (SI Appendix, Fig. S5). Cones
with radii of 1.27 cm and 2.0 cm were either 3D-printed (Makerbot Repli-
cator 2X, ABS plastic) or manufactured (acrylic). The cone half-angles, β,
were 12.5°, 30°, 35°, 40°, 45°, 50°, and 58°. Rectangular elastic beams were
created using vinylpolysiloxane (Elite Double 22; Zhermack Co.) (E = 0.95 MPa
and ρb = 1,160 kg/m3). Whereas a bird’s neck has a circular cross-section, the
elastic beams consist of a rectangular cross-section to control the beam’s
bending plane for image analysis. The elastic beam is attached to the cone on
one end and clamped at the other end at some distance L (2–10 cm) from the
cone base. Using the MATLAB image processing toolbox, the amplitude of the
beam (Δ Y) was correlated with the change in distance between the cone and
the clamp (Δ Z).
The cone–beam system is dropped from various heights, resulting in im-
pact velocities ranging from 0.5 to 2.5 m/s, and recorded using a high-speed
camera (IDT-N3, 1,000 frames per s). At least five trials are conducted for
each set of the experimental parameters. The changing vertical distance
(Δ Z) is calculated during a time frame ranging from slightly before impact to
a time when the specimen is submerged a distance equivalent to two cone
heights below the water surface. By measuring Δ Z, we can determine the
amplitude Δ Y while avoiding interference of the water splash. The ampli-
tude is nondimensionalized using the beam’s thickness, ΔY=h, from which
we can sort the data into three separate categories of stability: buckling,
transition, and nonbuckling.
After processing all high-speed videos for both amplitude and velocity
data, our experiments exhibit three states: stable, unstable, and transitionally
unstable. Quantitatively, these states can be characterized by distinct ranges
of the nondimensional amplitude. The stable state is characterized by a
nondimensional amplitude range less than one, which corresponds to the
nonbuckling behavior of the beam; conversely, the unstable state has a
nondimensional amplitude greater than one, which corresponds to the un-
stable buckling behavior. After repeated trials of a single case, the case is
considered stable if fewer than 20% of the trials buckle. If more than 80% of
the trials buckle, then the case is unstable. If 20–80% of the trials buckle, then
the case is characterized as transitionally unstable.
Derivation and Measurement of Forces. The drag force during the impact
phase is derived from the Euler–Lagrange equation. The Lagrangian is
defined as L = K. E. − P. E.
The kinetic energy term is described as
K. E. = 1=2ðmcone + maddÞV2, and the potential energy term, P. E., is neglec-
ted because it is small compared with the kinetic energy term. The added
mass term is dependent on the instantaneous radius of wetted area,
madd = 4=3ρfrðtÞ3. Further relationships to consider are rðtÞ = zðtÞtanðβÞ and
zðtÞ = Vt. Now, the Euler–Lagrange equation, ∂L=∂z − d=dtð∂L=∂ _
zÞ = 0, can be
reduced to FDragðt < Hcone=VÞ = 2ρfV4tan3ðβÞt2. After the impact phase,
the drag force is no longer time-dependent and simply becomes
FDragðt ≥ Hcone=VÞ = π=2ρfCdR2V2tanhðβÞ. The hydrostatic pressure force was
determined by integrating the pressure along the surface of the cone,
resulting in FHydrðtÞ = πρgR2
coneðzðtÞ − 2=3HconeÞ.

105-10; Omegadyne, Inc.). The force transducer is connected to a signal
conditioner (2310; Vishay), which collects data at a sampling rate of 1 kHz. The
high-speed camera was used again to determine the impact velocity at 1,000
frames per s. At least five trials were taken for the cone with β =12.5° and the
3D-printed northern gannet skull impacting the water from 2.0 to 3.2 m/s (SI
Appendix, Fig. S6).
Derivation of Dispersion Relation. Under an axial force, the lateral displace-
ment, YðZ, tÞ, of a slender elastic beam can be described by the linearized
Euler–Bernoulli beam equation, ρbAb∂2Y
∂t2 + ∂
∂Z
�
FðtÞ ∂Y
∂Z
�
+ EI ∂4Y
∂Z4 = 0, where ρb is
the beam density, Ab is the cross-sectional area of the beam, E is the elastic
modulus, I is the area moment of inertia of the beam, and FðtÞ is the axial load.
By assuming the normal mode [YðZ, tÞ = Y0eωt+ikZ] of the beam deflection, the
dispersion relation was determined to be ω2 =
EI
ρbAbk2�
FðtÞ
EI − k2�
. It is notewor-
thy that the axial force [FðtÞ] depends on time and therefore the growth rate
(ω) of perturbations changes over time. Assuming that different wavemodes
are independent, the growth rate, ω, at any given time is dependent only on
the history of the growth rate. Therefore, the growth rate with a time-de-
pendent force can be described by integrating ω over time at a given wave-
length (k). A similar approach has been used previously in the Rayleigh–
Plateau instability of a crown splash (30, 31). We use the time-dependent
force, which has a discontinuity at ~
T = 1.
Fig. 4A shows the dispersion relation between the integrated growth rate
(
R
ωdt) and nondimensional wavelength (kL). At any instance, the most
unstable mode (kL) is determined by finding the maximum of the integrated
growth rate [∂ð
R
ω2dtÞ=∂k = 0], which is marked in solid circles. We find that
the most unstable mode increases in the beginning until ~
T = 1. This trend of
the increasing unstable mode is anticipated primarily due to the increasing
compressive force due to impact. Beyond ~
T = 1, the most unstable mode
either shifts to a lower kL because steady drag is greater than the impact
force (SI Appendix, Fig. S7A; see β = 50°) or continues to increase because the
hydrostatic pressure force is greater than the steady drag (SI Appendix,
Fig. S7B).
Spatial Stability. If we assume force is time-independent (SI Appendix, Fig.
S8), the most unstable mode is given by ∂ω2=∂k = 0. Here, we find the critical
wavemode to be kcrit =
ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi
F=ð2EIÞ
p
. When the most unstable wavelength is less
than the beam length (2π=kcrit < L), the beam is unstable (buckled). As a
result,
the
beam
will
be
unstable
during
impact
when
8EIπ2=Fðt > H=VÞ < ðαLÞ2, where α = 2 is the prescribed boundary condition in
which one end of the beam is fixed and the other end is free to move lat-
erally. After substituting the forces at the moment of ~
T = 2, the resulting
equations yield
FDrag + FHydr − FW > FBend
�
= 2π2EI
L2
�
,
[2]
where FBend, FHydr, and FW are the resistive bending force, hydrostatic pres-
sure force, and weight of the cone, respectively. Rearranging terms in the
above equation yields Eq. 1.
In experiments, we chose a reference moment for the instability of the
beam as when the cone reaches two cone heights (or t = 2H=V) below the
free surface. Therefore, we incorporate the impact force into our analysis,
which produces an instability criterion in terms of geometric factors, mate-
rial properties, and impact velocity.
Neck Muscle Resistance. The results from the previous sections indicate that the
plunge-diving seabirds are able to dive safely at high impact speeds. The
analysis, however, neglects the role of neck muscles. We consider the neck
muscle force as a distributed follower load acting tangentially along the beam:
F = FDrag + FHydr − FW −
Z
fmuscledZ.
[3]
To simplify the analysis, the muscle force can be approximated as a constant
force per unit length, fmuscle. The muscle force per cross-sectional area is
estimated based on the value in ref. 37: 37 N/mm2 for geospiza fortis and
17 N/mm2 for geospiza fuliginosa. In this study, we chose the lowest value
(17 N/mm2) available in the literature to estimate the force generated by the
anterior neck muscle as fmuscle ’ 17 N/mm2 × (196 + 319) mm2/Lneck ’ 4.2 ×
104 N/m. There is a critical length for which a beam retains neutral stability
when an axial force competes with a distributed follower load (36). In our
case, this length is defined by LN = ðFDrag + FHydr − FWÞ=fmuscle. From our lin-
ear stability analysis, we have FDrag + FHydr − FW = 2π2EI=L2
N, which will yield
FDrag + FHydr − FW = FCritical = ð2π2EIÞ1=3f2=3
muscle. If the hydrostatic and drag force
exceeds the critical force, then the neck muscles will not be able to withstand
the hydrodynamic forces, causing the bird neck injuries during the plunge-
dive. By including the effects of the neck muscles, we speculate that the
plunge-diving birds will move even further from the transition line in the
stability diagram.
