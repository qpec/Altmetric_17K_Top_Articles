Aims
Systemic levels of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), a pro-atherogenic and pro-thrombotic metabolite produced
from gut microbiota metabolism of dietary trimethylamine (TMA)-containing nutrients such as choline or carnitine,
predict incident cardiovascular event risks in stable primary and secondary prevention subjects. However, the prog-
nostic value of TMAO in the setting of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) remains unknown.
...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
and results
We investigated the relationship of TMAO levels with incident cardiovascular risks among sequential patients pre-
senting with ACS in two independent cohorts. In the Cleveland Cohort, comprised of sequential subjects (n = 530)
presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) with chest pain of suspected cardiac origin, an elevated plasma
TMAO level at presentation was independently associated with risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE,
including myocardial infarction, stroke, need for revascularization, or death) over the ensuing 30-day (4th quartile
(Q4) adjusted odds ratio (OR) 6.30, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.89–21.0, P < 0.01) and 6-month (Q4 adjusted
OR 5.65, 95%CI, 1.91–16.7; P < 0.01) intervals. TMAO levels were also a significant predictor of the long term
(7-year) mortality (Q4 adjusted HR 1.81, 95%CI, 1.04–3.15; P < 0.05). Interestingly, TMAO level at initial presenta-
tion predicted risk of incident MACE over the near-term (30 days and 6 months) even among subjects who were
initially negative for troponin T (< 0.1 ng/mL) (30 days, Q4 adjusted OR 5.83, 95%CI, 1.79–19.03; P < 0.01). The
prognostic value of TMAO was also assessed in an independent multicentre Swiss Cohort of ACS patients
(n = 1683) who underwent coronary angiography. Trimethylamine N-oxide again predicted enhanced MACE risk
(1-year) (adjusted Q4 hazard ratios: 1.57, 95% CI, 1.03–2.41; P <0.05).

cardiovascular events, and may thus provide clinical utility in risk stratification among subjects presenting with sus-

Introduction
Recent studies highlight the participation of gut microbes in the
pathogenesis of both atherosclerotic heart disease1–4 and its adverse
thrombotic events.5 Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) is a plasma
metabolite shown to be formed through a metaorganismal pathway
involving nutrient precursors abundant in a Western diet (choline,
phosphatidylcholine, and L-carnitine) and the sequential action of
both gut microbiota, initially forming trimethylamine (TMA), followed
by host hepatic flavin monooxygenase-dependent conversion into
trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO).1,6 Numerous studies reveal an as-
sociation between systemic TMAO levels and cardiovascular risks in
a variety of stable cohorts.1–3,5,7–20
The relationship between TMAO levels and incident risks in sub-
jects with acute coronary syndromes has not yet been examined.
This is particularly relevant given that recent human platelet and ani-
mal model studies reveal that TMAO interacts with platelets, altering
stimulus-dependent calcium signalling, fostering platelet hyperreactiv-
ity and enhanced thrombosis potential in vivo.5 Numerous studies
have reported platelet hyperreactivity is a risk factor for incident car-
diovascular events.21,22 Trimethylamine N-oxide was also recently
shown in animal models to promote vascular inflammation, inducing
aortic endothelial cell activation and up-regulation of adhesion pro-
teins.23 Finally, recent clinical studies have shown that elevated sys-
temic levels of TMAO among stable subjects (n = 4007) undergoing
elective diagnostic cardiac evaluations predict incident thrombotic
event risks.5 A rational hypothesis is thus that circulating levels of
TMAO predict incident risks for thrombotic and cardiovascular
events among subjects presenting with acute coronary syndrome
(ACS). Herein, we sought to explore the relationship between sys-
temic levels of TMAO and incident major adverse cardiovascular
events (MACE, including myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, need for
revascularization, or death) and mortality among subjects presenting
with ACS in two independent prospective cohorts.
Methods
Study populations
Plasma samples and associated clinical data were collected from two in-
dependent populations, each of which was divided into a case: control co-
hort based upon clinical evidence of MACE. The Cleveland Cohort
(n = 530) was a single-center, prospective cohort study approved by the
Cleveland Clinic Institutional Review Board. Sequential consenting adult
subjects (ages 18 years and above) who presented to the emergency de-
partment (ED) with chest pain of suspected cardiac origin within 24h of
onset were eligible. Blood samples were drawn at the time of presenta-
tion to the emergency room (baseline) and 4, 8 and 16h later. TMAO
levels were examined, and baseline and serial cardiac troponin (cTnT)
testing were also performed. Of the initial 530 patients, 112 were TnT-
positive (cTnT >
_ 0.1 ng/mL) at initial presentation (baseline), and the 418
initially negative for cTnT were monitored for outcomes (MACE = MI,
stroke, need for revascularization or death at 1 month and 6 month; and
all-cause mortality annually) in the continuing TMAO study. All events
were adjudicated with medical record checks.
The Swiss ACS Cohort is part of the Special Program University
Medicine (SPUM), including all patients who underwent coronary angiog-
raphy for ACS at one of the participating University Hospitals (Zurich,
Bern, Lausanne, Geneva; see www.spum-acs.ch). This prospective multi-
centre cohort was based on consecutive recruitment and follow-up per-
formed at 30 days (phone call) and 1 year (clinical visit) of subjects with
adjudicated ACS. Inclusion criteria where: (1) patients older than 18 years
being admitted within 5 days (preferably within 72h) after pain onset
with the main diagnosis of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI),
non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) or unstable angina
(UA); (2) persistent ST-segment elevation or depression, T-inversion or
dynamic Electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, new left bundle branch block
(LBBB) or (3) evidence of positive troponin by local laboratory reference
values with a rise and/or fall in serial troponin levels; (4) known coronary
artery disease, specified as status after (MI), coronary artery bypass graft
(CABG), or Percutaneous Coronary Intervention or newly docu-
mented>
_ 50% stenosis of an epicardial coronary artery during the initial
catheterization. Exclusion criteria comprised (1) severe physical disability;
(2) inability to comprehend study; (3) less than 1 year of life expectancy
for non-cardiac reasons. All subjects gave written informed consent, and
the study was approved by the institutional review board (Ethical
Committee of the Canton of Zurich, Switzerland).
Medications
For the Cleveland Cohort, patients were treated during their hospital
stay and after discharge according to standard of care by their treating
physicians. For the Swiss ACS Cohort, the protocol for medications dur-
ing hospital stay and follow-up comprised administration of aspirin and an
additional platelet inhibitor (prasugrel or ticagrelor) for 1 year after the
ACS unless an indication for oral anticoagulation was present. Treating
physicians were advised to administer a statin (rosuvastatin 20mg/d), an
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor
blocker and a beta-blocker immediately after the ACS as tolerated by the
patient.
Laboratory testing
For the Cleveland Cohort, routine laboratory testing was performed,
including the Roche cTnT (4th generation) assay. For the Swiss ACS mul-
ticentre cohort, routine laboratory tests were performed according to
laboratories of each Institution. Given the different assays used for tropo-
nin, ratios of values on upper limit of reference (URL) were reported.
Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR; in mL/min per 1.73 m2) was
calculated for each cohort using the modification of Diet in Renal Disease
study equation.24

Quantification of plasma trimethylamine
N-oxide levels
Trimethylamine N-oxide levels in plasma were determined using stable
isotope dilution high-performance liquid chromatography with on line
electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) using
d9-(trimethyl)-labelled internal standard as described previously,25 but
on a Shimadzu 8050 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer interfaced to a
Shimadzu Nexera Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatograph
(UHPLC) system.
Clinical diagnosis
Positive troponin was defined by local laboratory reference values (e.g.
myocardial necrosis was defined by troponin T levels>
_ 0.1 ng/mL in the
Cleveland Cohort). Unstable angina was ascertained on the basis of the
presence of angina at rest, a sudden increase in episodes of previously sta-
ble angina, ST-segment depression, or T-wave inversions, as described
previously.26 For both the Cleveland Cohort and the Swiss ACS Cohort,
electrocardiographic data were verified independently by personnel at
electrocardiography core facilities who were unaware of the patients’
diagnoses. The diagnosis of an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) was
based on the presence of MI or unstable angina, as defined in the proto-
col, and confirmed by a chart review by an investigator who was unaware
of the patients’ diagnoses.
Definitions of outcomes
All-cause mortality included cardiac, vascular and non-cardiovascular
causes of death. Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) were
defined as a composite of MI, stroke, revascularization, or all-cause mor-
tality. Reviews of medical records and follow-up telephone interviews
or clinical visit were conducted for the 30-day, 6-month and 1 year
outcomes. The Cleveland Cohort was followed annually for all-cause
mortality. Repeat revascularization included any repeat coronary revas-
cularization (target and non-target vessel); clinically indicated repeat
revascularization included any clinically driven repeat coronary revascula-
rization (target and non-target vessel)
Statistical analysis
Student’s t-test or Wilcoxon-rank sum test for continuous variables and
v2 test for categorical variables were used to examine the difference be-
tween groups. Odds ratio (OR) for MACE and corresponding 95% confi-
dence interval (CI) were calculated using both univariable (unadjusted)
and multivariable (adjusted) logistic regression models. Hazards ratio
(HR) for incident MACE and corresponding 95% CI were calculated using
both univariable (unadjusted) and multivariable (adjusted) Cox models.
Kaplan–Meier analysis with Cox proportional hazards regression was
used for time-to-event analysis to determine HR and 95% CI for MACE
and all-cause mortality. Adjustments were made for individual traditional
cardiac risk factors including but not limited to age, gender, HDL, LDL,
smoking, presence or absence of a history of diabetes mellitus, hyperten-
sion, hyperlipidaemia, revascularization or coronary artery disease, high
sensitivity C-reactive protein level, eGFR, initial cTnT level, and diagnosis
of either STEMI, NSTEMI or unstable angina. Improvement in model per-
formance that was introduced by the inclusion of TMAO levels was eval-
uated with the use of net reclassification improvement (NRI), we also
calculated the C-statistic using the area under the receiver-operating-
characteristic (ROC) curve.27,28 Model validation and calibration are
shown in the Supplemental Statistical Methods section (Supplementary
material online, Table S1 and Figures S1–S3). All analyses were performed
using R 3.1.3 (Vienna, Austria) and P-values< 0.05 were considered statis-
tically significant.
Results
Characteristics of patients in both
Cleveland and Swiss ACS Cohorts
The Cleveland and Swiss ACS Cohorts examined comprised a total
of 2213 patients with baseline clinical characteristics summarized in
Tables 1 and 2 according to cohorts and stratified by MACE status.
The Cleveland Cohort was composed of 530 sequential patients
who presented to the emergency department with complaint of
chest pain. The average time from the onset of chest pain to presen-
tation and blood draw was 4.0 h. The Swiss ACS population included
1683 patients with ACS and onset of symptoms within 72h. Patients
who experienced MACE following enrolment in either the Cleveland
Cohort (learning cohort) or the Swiss ACS Cohort (validation co-
hort) were older, had a greater prevalence of revascularization and
diabetes, used aspirin and beta-blockers more frequently, and were
more likely to have higher C-reactive protein levels. In the Cleveland
Cohort, 112 patients (21.1%) were noted to be cTnT positive in the
initial evaluation period and 418 patients remained persistently nega-
tive for cTnT testing. In addition, 88 patients (16.6%) had unstable an-
gina and 199 patients (37.6%) had suspected ACS. Follow-up in the
Cleveland Cohort was completed for 30-day and 6-month out-
comes. All-cause mortality at 7 years was available in 89% (n = 474)
of the Cleveland Cohort subjects. Outcomes at 6 months included
MI in 117 patients, stroke in 6 patients, revascularization in 163 pa-
tients, death in 29 patients, and the composite MACE in 220 patients
(41.5%). In initial cTnT negative patients(n = 418), outcomes at 6
months comprised MI in 5 patients, stroke in 4 patients, revasculariza-
tion in 92 patients, death in 13 patients, and the composite MACE in
108 patients (25.8%). In the Swiss ACS Cohort, outcomes at 1 year
included MI in 52 patients, stroke in 21 patients, revascularization in
99 patients, death in 71 patients, and the composite MACE in 190 pa-
tients (11.3%).
The association of trimethylamine N-
oxide levels with incident major adverse
cardiovascular events and long-term
mortality in the Cleveland Cohort
Subjects with a higher plasma TMAO level at presentation were more
likely to experience incident MACE in the ensuing 30-day and 6-month
period. TMAO levels were also higher among subjects who died in the
long-term (7-year) follow-up period (Figure 1A). Kaplan-Meier analyses
of baseline TMAO levels also revealed dose-dependent increases in
mortality rates among subjects (log rank P< 0.001) (Figure 1B). We next
explored the relationship between plasma TMAO levels with incident
MACE risk. The frequency of experiencing a MACE at 30 days and 6
months following presentation increased with increasing quartiles of
TMAO levels as follows: 30-day and 6-month frequency of 30.1% and
31.6% in quartile 1(< 2.56 mM), 32.6% and 37.1% in quartile 2 (2.56–
4.27 mM), 40.2% and 43.9% in quartile 3 (4.28–7.89 mM), and 49.6% and
53.4% in quartile 4 (> 7.9 mM) (P< 0.01 for trend). As compared with
subjects in the lowest quartile of TMAO levels, patients in the highest
quartile (Q4) demonstrated a significantly increased 2.29-fold risk of in-
cident MACE at 30 days (OR, 2.29, 95% CI, 1.39–3.79; P< 0.01) (Figure
1C). Trimethylamine N-oxide levels also predicted the risk of MACE
over the following 6-month (Q4: OR 2.48, 95% CI, 1.51–4.09;

P< 0.001), as well as 7 year mortality risk (Q4 HR, 3.72, 95% CI, 2.23–
6.20; P< 0.001) (Figure 1D and E). To ascertain whether plasma TMAO
levels independently predict incident major adverse cardiac events
and long-term mortality, adjustments were made by using multivari-
able logistic-regression or Cox models for variables associated with
TMAO levels or outcomes in univariable models (age, gender, HDL,
LDL, smoking, presence or absence of a history of diabetes mellitus,
hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, revascularization or coronary artery
disease, C-reactive protein level, eGFR, initial cTnT level, diagnosis
of either STEMI, NSTEMI or unstable angina). Following adjustments,
elevated plasma levels of TMAO remained a significant predictor of
risks of incident MACE at 30 days (Q4 OR 6.30, 95% CI, 1.89–21.00;
P < 0.01), 6 months (Q4 OR 5.65, 95% CI, 1.91–16.74; P < 0.01) and
all-cause mortality at 7 years (Q4 HR 1.81, 95% CI, 1.04–3.15;
P < 0.05) (Figure 1C–E). The inclusion of TMAO as a variable resulted
in a significant improvement in risk estimation over traditional risk
factors for MACE at 30 days as monitored by net reclassification im-
provement (NRI, 0.36 (0.19–0.53), P < 0.001; C statistic, 0.94 (0.92–

The relation of trimethylamine N-oxide
levels and incident major adverse
cardiovascular events risks among
patients initially negative for troponin T
at presentation
Given the recent demonstration that TMAO impacts platelet func-
tion, fostering hyperreactivity and enhanced thrombosis potential,5
we sought to evaluate whether knowledge of TMAO levels at initial
presentation may provide added potential clinical utility in risk stratifi-
cation among patients initially cTnT negative at presentation. Of the
530 subjects enrolled, 418 were persistently cTnT negative during
the initial evaluation period. Within this sub-cohort, TMAO levels
were higher amongst those who subsequently experienced an inci-
dent MACE at 30 days (median (IQR) 5.5 mM (3.5–9.9) vs. 3.7 mM
(2.4–6.9); P < 0.001) and 6 months (median (IQR) 5.3 mM (3.3–9.6)
vs. 3.7 mM (2.4–6.8); P < 0.0001) compared with those who did not.
For patients who were initially negative for troponin T, the frequency
of subsequent MACE at 30 days and 6 months, respectively,
increased with increasing quartiles of TMAO (e.g. 10.5% and 12.4% in
Q1 (< 2.59 mM); 19.2% and 25.0% in Q2(2.59–4.13 mM); 25.2% and
29.1% in Q3 (4.14–7.59 mM); and 31.1% and 36.8% in Q4 (> 7.59
mM) (P < 0.05 for trend)). The relationship of TMAO quartiles as a
predictor for MACE among patients initially (baseline sample) cTnT
negative are shown in Figure 2. Trimethylamine N-oxide levels re-
mained a significant predictor of MACE among these subjects at both
30 days (Q4 OR 5.83, 95% CI, 1.79–19.03; P < 0.01) and 6 months
(Q4 OR 5.51, 95%CI, 1.90–16.01; P < 0.001) after adjusting for risk
factors including age, gender, HDL, LDL, smoking, presence or ab-
sence of a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia,
revascularization or coronary artery disease, C-reactive protein level,
eGFR, initial cTnT level and diagnosis of either STEMI, NSTEMI or
unstable angina. The inclusion of TMAO as a variable resulted in a sig-
nificant improvement in risk estimation over traditional risk factors
for MACE at 30 days (NRI, 0.41 (0.19-0.63), P < 0.001; C statistic,
0.89 (0.85–0.93) (with TMAO) vs. 0.84 (0.78–0.9) (without TMAO),
P < 0.01) and 6 months (NRI, 0.33 (0.12–0.54), P < 0.01; C statistic,
0.87 (0.83–0.91) vs. 0.84 (0.78–0.9), P < 0.05)) (Supplementary mate
rial online, Table S2).
The association of trimethylamine N-
oxide levels with incident major adverse
cardiovascular events and mortality in
the Swiss Acute Coronary Syndrome
Cohort
We next sought to determine whether the strong prognostic value of
TMAO in ACS subjects observed in the single center Cleveland
Cohort could be replicated in an independent multi-site cohort.
Plasma TMAO levels in the Swiss ACS Cohort similarly showed higher
TMAO levels amongst patients who experienced adverse outcomes,
including 1 year MACE (3.75 mM(2.14–7.04), n= 190, vs. 2.80
lM (1.91–4.55), n= 1493; P<0.001), and 1 year mortality (5.95 mM
(2.79–13.08), n= 71, vs. 2.82 mM(1.92–4.61), n= 1612; P<0.001), re-
spectively (Figure 3A). Kaplan–Meier survival analyses revealed quartile
levels of TMAO were associated with a graded increase (log rank
P< 0.001) in incident MACE risk among patients in the Swiss ACS
Cohort, with highest cumulative MACE rate noted especially in the 4th
quartile (Figure 3B). Multilogistic regression analyses of the relationship
between TMAO levels and adverse events at 1 year (adjustments for
age, gender, HDL, LDL, smoking, presence or absence of a history of
diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, revascularization or
coronary artery disease, C-reactive protein level, eGFR, and diagnosis
of either STEMI, NSTEMI or unstable angina) similarly revealed

elevated levels of TMAO remained a significant predictor of MACE
(Q4 adjusted HR 1.57, 95% CI, 1.03–2.41, P< 0.05), while the associ-
ation of TMAO levels with mortality was attenuated following the
adjustments (Figure 3C and D). The inclusion of TMAO as a variable to
the model prediction of MACE resulted in a significant improvement in
risk estimation over traditional risk factors (NRI, 0.3 (0.16–0.44), P <
0.001); but no significant improvement in C-statistic (C-statistic, 0.66
(0.62–0.7) (with TMAO) vs. 0.64 (0.6–0.68) (without TMAO); P =
0.15). Inclusion of TMAO in the model for predicting 1-year mortality
resulted in significant improvement in NRI (0.45 (0.25–0.65), P <
0.001), but no significant improvement in C-statistic (0.78 (0.72–0.84)
with TMAO vs. 0.77 (0.71–0.83) without TMAO; P = 0.26)
(Supplemental material online, Table S2).
Plasma TMAO levels were higher on average in the Cleveland
cohort compared with the Swiss cohort, and the quartile cut-offs
used for each cohort were thus different. In a final set of analyses
we further examined the impact of TMAO cut point selection
across both cohorts. We stratified each cohort based on TMAO
levels ranging from 2.4 to 12.6 lM at every 0.2 lM increment to
define high vs. low TMAO level (Supplemental material online,
Tables S3 and 4). In both the Cleveland and Swiss cohorts, regard-
less of the TMAO cut point, the association between adverse

robustly strong (all P < 0.01).
Discussion
The accurate diagnosis of cardiovascular events in patients presenting
with acute coronary syndromes by electrocardiography (ECG) and
conventional laboratory tests is challenging. The recent demonstration
that the TMAO pathway impacts multiple aspects of ‘patient vulner-
ability’, including development of atherosclerotic plaque,1–4 alteration
in macrophage and endothelial cell phenotype,3,23 and promotion of
platelet hyperresponsiveness,5 makes this circulating metabolite par-
ticularly interesting to explore in the setting of subjects presenting with
chest pain and suspected ACS. The present study demonstrates for
the first time that systemic TMAO levels are associated with both
near-term risk of MACE and long term mortality, among sequential pa-
tients presenting with complaint of chest pain and suspected ACS in
two independent ACS cohorts. TMAO levels showed a dose-depend-
ent relationship between increase in risk of incident MACE and higher
TMAO levels in both the Cleveland and Swiss cohorts (Supplementary
material online Figure S4). These studies thus add to the growing body
of data demonstrating that the gut microbiota dependent metabolite,
TMAO, may serve as a clinically useful and potentially modifiable prog-
nostic marker for both near-term and long-term cardiovascular out-
comes beyond currently used risk factors and laboratory testing.
These findings not only broaden the potential clinical utility of TMAO
as an independent prognostic marker to those presenting with sus-
pected ACS, but also suggest, in combination with the recent studies
linking this metabolite to platelet function, a potential basis for a novel
therapeutic target in the management of ACS patients.
In the quest to improve outcomes in patients with cardiovascular
heart disease, which still remains the leading cause of death world-
wide,29–31 research has focused on novel modifiable risk factors, with a
special attention to environmental sources.32,33 Although nutrition has
always been linked to outcomes of cardiovascular patients, the pivotal
role of the gut microbiome has only recently been recognized in this
context. Hence, we have sought to assess the impact of the gut micro-
biome dependent metabolite, TMAO, on cardiovascular outcomes in
patients with ACS. To strengthen the impact of our findings, after initial
observation of associations with MACE risk in the Cleveland cohort,
we sought to validate these findings by exploring the relationship be-
tween TMAO levels and adverse outcomes in an independent large
prospective multi-center Swiss ACS registry with independent events
adjudication. The prognostic value of TMAO has thus far predomin-
antly been examined in lower risk community based or stable cardiac
cohorts.1–3,5,7–20 Our results are consistent with these other clinical
studies in that they show that elevated levels of TMAO may serve as
an independent risk factor of MACE and long-term all-cause mortality,
including in those presenting with ACS. The impact of risk stratification
by TMAO quartiles was most strikingly evident in patients belonging to
the 4th quartile (Q4), where they faced an approximate two-fold
increased hazard of 7-year mortality when compared with those in the
lowest quartile. It should be noted, however, that while the majority
of studies in different cohorts have observed a positive associ-
ation between systemic TMAO levels and incident cardiovascular
risks,1–3,5,7–20,34 others have not.35,36 The reasons for these differences
are unclear, but it is noteworthy that the negative studies have tended
to be both smaller than comparable alternative positive studies, and in
general to have lower event rates (and often TMAO levels).
Interestingly, a recent large (n> 1000) clinical study exploring the prog-
nostic value of TMAO in subjects on haemodialysis observed that the
strength of the association between TMAO and adverse events dif-
fered somewhat by race, with whites showing a significant association
between higher TMAO levels and heightened incident risk of cardiac
death, sudden cardiac death, first cardiovascular event, and any-cause
death, whereas in blacks, elevated TMAO levels were only significantly
associated with cardiac death.34 It is also noteworthy that in an alterna-
tive recent study, genetic variants in the flavin monooxygenase 3 gene,
the host hepatic enzyme primarily responsible for conversion of TMA
into TMAO,6 were reported to be associated with both rate of chronic
kidney disease progression and mortality risk in patients with impaired
renal function.37 Trimethylamine N-oxide exerts pro-atherosclerotic
effects via a variety of effects, including changes in macrophage and tis-
sue sterol metabolism, and endothelial cell activation1,3,23. In line with
these findings, recent studies reveal that TMAO levels are highly
related to the coronary atherosclerotic burden and plaque complexity
as monitored by the SYNTAX score.19 In addition, TMAO has a pro-
thrombotic effect by altering platelet calcium signalling, rendering plate-
lets more responsive to agonists, increasing the risk of in vivo thrombus
formation.5 All these effects are crucial mechanisms of acute coronary
syndromes and their complications during follow-up. Furthermore, ex-
perimental evidence suggests that the use of a drug that selectively tar-
gets microbial TMA production and lowers plasma TMAO levels in
the host can serve as a means of inhibiting diet-induced atherosclerosis
in animal models.38 Similarly, use of antisense oligonucleotide
approaches to knock down flavin monooxygenase 3, the major hepatic
enzyme responsible for the conversion of microbial-generated TMA
into TMAO,6 suppresses TMAO levels, inhibits atherosclerosis in ani-
mal models, and reveals the TMAO metaorganismal pathway as a cen-
tral regulator of tissue cholesterol cholesterol balance.39–41 Thus,
TMAO appears to not only be a risk marker, but also may serve as a
potential therapeutic target to improve outcomes in patients, including
subjects with ACS. Moreover, as suggested by previous work, TMAO
also appears to exert a particularly profound impact on outcomes in
patients developing post-infarction heart failure, and in animal models
was shown to accelerate adverse ventricular remodeling and dysfunc-
tion.8,42 It is also of interest that in the present study, in the sub analysis
involving patients with chest pain and negative troponin, plasma levels
of TMAO maintained strong prognostic significance beyond traditional
risk factors, biomarkers and electrocardiographic data. It is therefore
tempting to speculate that the ability to generate rapid and accurate
TMAO results through point-of-care testing could significantly im-
prove rapid triaging and risk stratification amongst subjects presenting
with the complaint of chest pain and suspected ACS.
As again exemplified in the patient cohorts of this study, event
rates in ACS remain high in spite of all the progress made in the man-
agement and secondary prevention of ACS over the last few decades.
It is of note that both the plasma levels of TMAO and the event rates
were higher in the US compared with the Swiss patients, and that in-
cident event rates increased dose dependently in both cohorts. The
burden of comorbidities was significantly higher within the Cleveland
cohort, and this may account in part for these observations.
Whether different dietary behaviours may also be involved in these

differences is unknown. As a metabolite produced as a result of gut
microbe action of specific dietary nutrients, TMAO is uniquely pos-
itioned at the interface between our diet and cardiovascular disease
pathogenesis. It is therefore interesting to note that recent
large-scale epidemiological studies examining phosphatidylcholine in-
gestion, a nutrient that is more abundant in animal products, and
mortality risks in>100 000 subjects with over a quarter century of
follow-up, revealed phosphatidylcholine consumption is associated
with increased all-cause and cardiovascular mortality independent of
traditional risk factors.43 Moreover, adherence to a vegetarian or
vegan diet compared with an omnivorous diet is reported to be asso-
ciated with reduced plasma and urinary levels of TMAO.3,44 These
results suggest that studies are needed in patients presenting with
ACS to test whether dietary modification efforts coupled with moni-
toring TMAO levels can serve as an additional potential intervention
to help reduce long term adverse risks. For example, our current
understanding of the biosynthetic pathway of TMAO1,3,45 can pro-
vide additional hints on how one could possibly intervene. Indeed,
consumption of choline and L-carnitine rich diets offer the necessary
precursors for the production of TMAO.2,3 Hence, a change in diet-
ary habits, specifically to that of the Mediterranean type,46 which has
been shown to decrease the risk of adverse cardiovascular events in
both observational and prospective studies,47,48 could be tested to
determine whether diet-induced reduction in TMAO enhances sec-
ondary prevention in patients after ACS. Animal model studies sug-
gest another approach to the high TMAO ACS patient could involve
inhibition of the gut microbial participants involved in metabolic pro-
duction of TMAO.49 Particularly promising is the effective experi-
mental use of 3,3-dimethyl-1-butanol (DMB), which by inhibiting
microbial choline and carnitine TMA lyase activities in vivo appears to
prevent foam cell formation and aortic atherosclerotic plaque forma-
tion, while maintaining a normal gut flora.38
Limitations
This study provides the basis for future studies investigating interven-
tions to lower TMAO levels in ACS patients to confirm a cause effect
relationship. On its own, our findings are hypothesis generating for
such trials, but establish the prognostic information provided by
TMAO in ACS patients. Cause of death was not available for the
Cleveland cohort, so all-cause death was used as the mortality end
point. Another limitation of the present study is that plasma samples
from subjects presenting with suspected ACS were not necessarily
fasting, and no information was collected on timing of presentation
relative to last meal, or dietary patterns preceding presentation in ei-
ther the Cleveland or Swiss ACS cohorts. Nonetheless, the present
studies reveal that the prognostic value of TMAO in the ACS setting
appears to be reproducible in both the US (single site) and Swiss
(multi-site) cohorts.
Conclusion
To the best of our knowledge, we were able to show for the first
time that TMAO is an important prognostic marker in predicting
both near- and long-term adverse cardiovascular events beyond
traditional risk factors and laboratory tests in the setting of acute cor-
onary syndrome. This was not only true for patients with elevated
troponins due to a STEMI or NSTEMI, but also was observed for pa-
tients who did not suffer an infarction, but rather, were negative for
troponin at initial presentation. The importance of our findings is
underlined by the modifiable nature of TMAO, both with diet, and
with potential therapeutics under development, offering new pro-
spects for treatment strategies at both levels of primary and second-
ary prevention.
