Abstract
INTRODUCTION—Cancer is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States and 
results in a high economic burden.
OBJECTIVE—To estimate age-standardized mortality rates by US county from 29 cancers.
DESIGN AND SETTING—Deidentified death records from the National Center for Health 
Statistics (NCHS) and population counts from the Census Bureau, the NCHS, and the Human 
Mortality Database from 1980 to 2014 were used. Validated small area estimation models were 
used to estimate county-level mortality rates from 29 cancers: lip and oral cavity; nasopharynx; 
other pharynx; esophageal; stomach; colon and rectum; liver; gallbladder and biliary; pancreatic; 
larynx; tracheal, bronchus, and lung; malignant skin melanoma; nonmelanoma skin cancer; breast; 
cervical; uterine; ovarian; prostate; testicular; kidney; bladder; brain and nervous system; thyroid; 
mesothelioma; Hodgkin lymphoma; non-Hodgkin lymphoma; multiple myeloma; leukemia; and 
all other cancers combined.
EXPOSURE—County of residence.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES—Age-standardized cancer mortality rates by county, 
year, sex, and cancer type.

 RESULTS—A total of 19 511 910 cancer deaths were recorded in the United States between 
1980 and 2014, including 5 656 423 due to tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer; 2 484 476 due to 
colon and rectum cancer; 1 573 593 due to breast cancer; 1 077 030 due to prostate cancer; 1 157 
878 due to pancreatic cancer; 209 314 due to uterine cancer; 421 628 due to kidney cancer; 487 
518 due to liver cancer; 13 927 due to testicular cancer; and 829 396 due to non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma. Cancer mortality decreased by 20.1%(95% uncertainty interval [UI], 18.2%–21.4%) 
between 1980 and 2014, from 240.2 (95% UI, 235.8–244.1) to 192.0 (95% UI, 188.6–197.7) 
deaths per 100 000 population. There were large differences in the mortality rate among counties 
throughout the period: in 1980, cancer mortality ranged from 130.6 (95% UI, 114.7–146.0) per 
100 000 population in Summit County, Colorado, to 386.9 (95% UI, 330.5–450.7) in North Slope 
Borough, Alaska, and in 2014 from 70.7 (95% UI, 63.2–79.0) in Summit County, Colorado, to 
503.1 (95% UI, 464.9–545.4) in Union County, Florida. For many cancers, there were distinct 
clusters of counties with especially high mortality. The location of these clusters varied by type of 
cancer and were spread in different regions of the United States. Clusters of breast cancer were 
present in the southern belt and along the Mississippi River, while liver cancer was high along the 
Texas-Mexico border, and clusters of kidney cancer were observed in North and South Dakota and 
counties in West Virginia, Ohio, Indiana, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Texas, Alaska, and Illinois.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—Cancer mortality declined overall in the United States 
between 1980 and 2014. Over this same period, there were important changes in trends, patterns, 
and differences in cancer mortality among US counties. These patterns may inform further 
research into improving prevention and treatment.
Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States and globally.1 Moreover, 
cancer is a major cause of morbidity in the United States1 and is associated with a high 
economic burden.2 Overall cancer mortality rates have declined in the United States in 
recent decades; however, major differences in cancer mortality still exist.3
Several studies have reported on the variation in cancer mortality by state.4,5 This variation 
is at least partially explained by differences in risk factors, socioeconomic factors, and 
access to high-quality treatment.6 For example, smoking rates have declined in the United 
States, but this decline varied by location.7 Similarly, while obesity increased in recent years 
throughout the United States,8 the rate of increase varied widely.9 Moreover, access to health 
care and the quality of available health care varies tremendously among states and different 
socioeconomic groups.10
Most previous reports on geographic differences in cancer mortality have focused on 
variation by state, with less information available at the county level.4 There is a value for 
data at the county level because public health programs and policies are mainly designed and 
implemented at the local level. Moreover, local information can also be useful for health 
care clinicians to understand community needs for care and aid in identifying cancer hot 
spots that need more investigation to understand the root causes.
Methods
This analysis used methods reported in detail elsewhere.11 A brief description of this 
approach and its application to cancer mortality is provided below. This research received

 institutional review board approval from the University of Washington. Informed consent 
was not required because the study used deidentified data and was retrospective.
Data
Deidentified death records from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)12 and 
population counts from the Census Bureau,13 the NCHS,14–16 and the Human Mortality 
Database were used.17 Deaths and population were tabulated by county, age group (0, 1–4, 
5–9, …, 75–79, and ≥80 years), sex, year, and (in the case of death data) cause. County-level 
information on levels of education, income, race/ethnicity, Native American reservations, 
and population density derived from data provided by the Census Bureau and the NCHS 
were also used. More detail on these data sources is provided in eTable 1 in the Supplement.
Cause List and Garbage Code Redistribution Methods
The study used the cause list developed for the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and 
Risk Factors Study (GBD).1 This cause list is arranged hierarchically in 4 levels, and within 
each level the list is exhaustive and mutually exclusive. eTable 2 in the Supplement lists all 
causes in the GBD cause list and the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision 
and International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth 
Revision codes that correspond to each cause. Although the focus of this study is cancers, all 
causes of death in the GBD cause list were analyzed concurrently.
Previous studies1 have documented the existence of “garbage codes” in death registration 
data, which may lead to misleading spatial and temporal patterns, as well as misleading 
ranks among causes, as the percentage of deaths assigned garbage codes varies by location, 
year, and true underlying cause. This study used garbage redistribution methods developed 
for the GBD to reallocate deaths assigned garbage codes.1 First, plausible target causes were 
identified for each garbage code or group of garbage codes. Second, deaths were reassigned 
to the specified target codes according to proportions derived in 1 of 4 ways: (1) published 
literature or expert opinion; (2) regression models; (3) according to the proportions initially 
observed among targets; and (4) for HIV/AIDS specifically, by comparison with years 
before HIV/AIDS became widespread.
Small Area Models
The study estimated spatially explicit Bayesian mixed-effects regression models for cancer 
mortality in the GBD hierarchy, separately for males and females. The model for each cause 
was specified as
where Dj,t,a, Pj,t,a, and mj,t,a are the number of deaths, the population, and the underlying 
mortality rate, respectively, for county j, year t, and age group a. The model for mj,t,a 
contained 6 components: an intercept (β0), fixed covariate effects (β1),random age-time 
effects (γ1,a,t),random spatial effects (γ2,j), random space-time effects (γ3,j and γ4,j,t), and

 random space-age effects (γ5,j and γ6,j,a). The model incorporated 7 covariates: the 
proportion of the adult population that graduated high school, the proportion of the 
population that is Hispanic, the proportion of the population that is black, the proportion of 
the population that is a race other than black or white, the proportion of a county that is 
contained within a state or federal Native American reservation, the median household 
income, and the population density. γ1, γ2, γ3, and γ5 were assumed to follow conditional 
autoregressive distributions, which allow for smoothing over adjacent age groups and years 
(γ1) or counties (γ2, γ3, and γ5). γ4 and γ6 were assumed to follow independent mean-zero 
normal distributions.
Models were fit using the Template Model Builder Package18 in R version 3.2.4.19 Model 
predictions were then raked (ie, iteratively scaled along multiple dimensions) to ensure 
consistency between levels of the cause hierarchy and simultaneously ensure consistency 
with existing national-level estimates from the GBD. After raking, age-standardized 
mortality rates were calculated using the US 2010 Census population as the standard, and 
years of life lost were calculated by multiplying the mortality rate by population by life 
expectancy at the average age at death in the reference life table used in the GBD1 and then 
summing across all ages. When measuring changes over time, the change was considered 
statistically significant if the posterior probability of an increase (or decrease) was at least 
95%. No explicit correction for multiple testing (ie, across multiple counties) was applied; 
however, modeling all counties simultaneously is expected to mitigate the risk of spuriously 
detecting changes due to multiple testing. The study reports mortality rates for lip and oral 
cavity; nasopharynx; other pharynx; esophageal; stomach; colon and rectum; liver; 
gallbladder and biliary; pancreatic; larynx; tracheal, bronchus, and lung; malignant skin 
melanoma; nonmelanoma skin cancer; breast; cervical; uterine; ovarian; prostate; testicular; 
kidney; bladder; brain and nervous system; thyroid; mesothelioma; Hodgkin lymphoma; 
non-Hodgkin lymphoma; multiple myeloma; leukemia; and all other cancers combined.
Risk Factors and Population-Attributable Fraction
Full detailed methods for calculating relative risks and population-attributable fractions are 
available elsewhere.20 Briefly, GBD 2015 used the comparative risk assessment framework 
developed for previous iterations of the GBD study to estimate attributable deaths, 
disability-adjusted life-years, and trends in exposure by age group, sex, year, and geography 
for 79 behavioral, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks or clusters of risks 
over the period 1990 to 2015. Two types of risk assessments are possible within the 
comparative risk assessment framework: attributable burden and avoidable burden. 
Attributable burden is the reduction in current disease burden that would have been possible 
if past population exposure had shifted to an alternative or counterfactual distribution of risk 
exposure. Avoidable burden is the potential reduction in future disease burden that could be 
achieved by changing the current distribution of exposure to a counterfactual distribution of 
exposure. Four types of counterfactual exposure distributions have been identified21: (1) 
theoretical minimum risk; (2) plausible minimum risk; (3) feasible minimum risk; and (4) 
cost-effective minimum risk. In GBD studies and in this study, the focus was on attributable 
burden using the theoretical minimum risk level, which is the level of risk exposure that

 minimizes risk at the population level or the level of risk that captures the maximum 
attributable burden.
Results
Table 1 shows the number of deaths, years of life lost, and age-standardized mortality rates 
at the national level as well as the distribution of age-standardized mortality rates at the 
county level for each cancer. The study reported the number of years of life lost in addition 
to deaths to account for the fact that many deaths from certain cancers occur at an older age. 
For example, prostate cancer was the fifth leading cause of death among cancers but the 
ninth leading cause of cancer years of life lost. Lung, colon, and breast cancer were the top 3 
leading causes for all metrics. Lung, colon, and breast cancers also had the largest absolute 
difference in mortality between counties at the 90th percentile and the 10th percentile. Lung 
cancer mortality rates were twice as high among counties in the 90th percentile compared 
with counties in the 10th.
Table 2 shows the 5-year relative survival for selected cancers from the Surveillance, 
Epidemiology, and End Results program22,23 (the corresponding age-specific estimates are 
given in eTable 3 in the Supplement) and the population-attributable fraction from the GBD 
using the comparative risk assessment approach.20 Although cancer survival improved from 
1973 to 2014 for all cancers, 6 cancers (testicular, thyroid, prostate, breast, melanoma, and 
Hodgkin lymphoma)had a 5-year survival rate of more than 85%. The population 
attributable fraction of risk factors was the highest for lung and cervical cancer and the 
lowest for ovarian cancer.
Results for all cancers combined and for 10 specific cancers are presented below and 
graphically in the Figures, with results for the remaining cancers presented in eFigures 1–23 
in the Supplement. The 10 specific cancers highlighted below were chosen because they 
have either high burden (eg, tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer), because they are 
responsive to treatment (eg, testicular cancer), or because screening is an important 
component of the health system response (eg, breast cancer). For cancers that predominantly 
or exclusively affect males or females (eg, breast cancer, prostate cancer), results are 
reported for males or females only, while in all other cases results are presented for both 
sexes combined. Mortality rates by county for each cancer are available in an online 
visualization tool (Interactive).

 All Cancers
From 1980 to 2014, 19 511 910 cancer deaths were recorded in the United States. Cancer 
mortality (Figure 1) decreased from 1980 to 2014, with mortality rates dropping from 240.2 
(95% uncertainty interval [UI], 235.8–244.1) deaths per 100 000 population in 1980 to 192.0 
(95% UI, 188.6–197.7) in 2014, a 20.1% (95% UI, 18.2%–21.4%) decrease. In 1980, the 
lowest mortality rate was 130.6 (95% UI, 114.7–146.0) deaths per 100 000 population in 
Summit County, Colorado, while the highest was 386.9 (95% UI, 330.5–450.7) in North 
Slope Borough, Alaska; in 2014, the lowest was 70.7 (95% UI, 63.2–79.0) deaths per 100 
000 population for Summit County, Colorado, and 503.1 (95% UI, 464.9–545.4) in Union 
County, Florida (eTable 4 in the Supplement). In 2014, there were clusters of high mortality 
in several areas of the South, in Kentucky, West Virginia, Alabama, and along the 
Mississippi River, and in Western Alaska. Moreover, there were some high rates in counties 
in North and South Dakota and Texas, while lower rates were present in Utah and Colorado. 
There were statistically significant increases in cancer mortality between 1980 and 2014 in 
160 counties, with the highest rates of increase observed in Kentucky and scattered across 
regions of the South.
Tracheal, Bronchus, and Lung Cancer
A total of 5 656 423 deaths from tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer were recorded between 
1980 and 2014. Tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer mortality (Figure 2) declined by 21.0% 
(95% UI, 17.9%–24.0%) between 1980 and 2014, from 68.6 (95% UI, 66.8–70.3) deaths per 
100 000 population to 54.2 (95% UI, 52.7–55.6). The West and Northeast experienced 
declines in the mortality rate, as did Florida, while increases were observed in the South, 
Appalachian region, and the Midwest. The largest increase from 1980 to 2014 was observed

 in Owsley County, Kentucky (99.7%; 95% UI, 73.7%–130.8%), while the greatest decline 
was observed in Aleutians East Borough and Aleutians West Census Area, Alaska (63.6%; 
95% UI, 50.3%–73.5%). High mortality rates in 2014 were clustered in Kentucky and West 
Virginia. Because national rates peaked in 1988, women in 2215 counties experienced a 
statistically significant increase in the mortality rate, while this was true for men in only 11 
counties. The highest national mortality rate for men was present in 1980, while the peak in 
mortality rate for women was in 2001. The largest percentage increase (168.3%; 95% UI, 
136.4%207.8) from 1980 to the peak in 2001 for women was observed in Marlboro County, 
South Carolina (mortality rate of 67.1 [95% UI, 61.4–73.5] deaths per 100000 population in 
2001). Mortality rates varied from 10.6 (95% UI, 8.6–12.8) in Summit County, Colorado, to 
334.9 (95% UI, 300.5–375.2) in Union County, Florida, for males and 10.9 (95% UI, 8.3–
13.8) in Summit County, Colorado, to 121 (95% UI, 101.6–142.0) in Owsley County, 
Kentucky, for females. Low rates were observed along the US border with Mexico and in 
Utah, Colorado, and parts of Arizona, New Mexico, and Idaho.
Colon and Rectum Cancer
Between 1980 and 2014, 2 484 476 deaths due to colon and rectum cancer were recorded. 
Mortality from colon and rectum cancer (Figure 3) declined by 35.5% (95% UI, 32.9%–
38.0%) from 1980 to 2014, from 34.3 (95% UI, 33.5–35.3) deaths per 100 000 population to 
22.1 (95% UI, 21.5–22.8), with the largest decline occurring since 2000. The highest rate of 
deaths per 100000 population in 2014 was observed in Union County, Florida (58.4; 95% 
UI, 52.0–65.2), while the lowest was in Summit County, Colorado (8.1; 95% UI, 7.0–9.3). 
There were clusters of high rates in 2014, with the largest along the Mississippi River in 
Missouri, Mississippi, Arkansas, and Louisiana, and others in southern Alabama, Alaska, 
and along the border of West Virginia and Kentucky. Several counties in Nevada, North and 
South Dakota, and Montana also had high rates. Statistically significant declines in mortality 
rates from colon and rectum cancers between 1980 and 2014 were observed in most (2420) 
counties, with the largest declines found in Howard County, Maryland (64.2%; 95% UI, 
60.7%–67.4%) and Nassau County, New York (62.3%; 95% UI, 60.1%–64.3%).
Breast Cancer
A total of 1 573 593 deaths from breast cancer were recorded between 1980 and 2014. 
Nationally, breast cancer mortality (Figure 4) decreased by 32.7% (95% UI, 20.8%–37.1%) 
from 1980 (21.2 [95% UI, 20.2–22.2] deaths per 100 000 population) to 2014 (14.3; 95% 
UI, 13.6–16.6). The largest decreases from 1980 to 2014 were observed in the Northeast, 
southern Florida, and parts of the northern Midwest. Most counties (1910) experienced 
statistically significant declines in the mortality rate among women. Summit County, 
Colorado (55.3%; 95% UI, 40.5%–66.3%), and Nassau County, New York (54.9%; 95% UI, 
58.6%–46.6%), experienced the largest declines in mortality rates for women. Mortality 
rates for women in 2014 ranged from 11.3 (95% UI, 9.1–13.9) per 100 000 in Summit 
County, Colorado, to 51.8 (95% UI, 46.8–60.4) per 100 000 in Madison County, Mississippi. 
Clusters of high rates remained in the southern belt and along the Mississippi River, while 
lower rates were observed in parts of the West, Midwest, and Northeast.

 Prostate Cancer
A total of 1 077 030 deaths from prostate cancer were recorded between 1980 and 2014. 
Prostate cancer mortality (Figure 5) declined by 21.7% (95% UI, 6.3%–31.9%) between 
1980 and 2014 from 13.0(95% UI, 8.6–16.1) to 10.2 (95% UI, 8.4–15.7) deaths per 100000. 
Although many counties (1558) experienced significant declines in mortality rates for men, 
percentage changes in the male mortality rate between 1980 and 2014 ranged from a 
69.4%(95% UI, 52.6%–79.8%) decrease in Aleutians East Borough and Aleutians West 
Census Area, Alaska, to a 26.1%(95% UI, −7.2% to 83.9%)increase in the mortality rate in 
Owsley County, Kentucky. In 2014, the rates for men varied from 64.1 (95% UI, 52.0–96.5) 
deaths per 100000 in Madison County, Mississippi, to 10.0 (95% UI, 7.5–15.4) deaths per 
100 000 in Summit County, Colorado. Cluster patterns similar to those of breast cancer rates 
remained in the southern belt and along the Mississippi River. Alabama, Georgia, South 
Carolina, and Virginia also had counties with very high rates while counties in southern 
Florida and along the US border with Mexico had lower rates.
Pancreatic Cancer
Between 1980 and 2014, 1 157 878 deaths due to pancreatic cancer were recorded. The 
mortality rate from pancreatic cancer (Figure 6) in 2014 (12.8 [95% UI, 12.4–13.2] deaths 
per 100 000) was 1.8% (−2.3% to 5.6%) lower than in 1980 (13.0 [95% UI, 12.6–13.4] 
deaths per 100 000). Across counties, changes from 1980 to 2014 ranged from increases of 
51.7% (95% UI, 31.3%–76.4%) in Union County, Florida, to decreases of 46.2% (95% UI, 
29.0%–60.3%) in Aleutians East Borough and Aleutians West Census Area, Alaska. 
Increases were seen across the nation, with clusters of larger increases in Kentucky, Kansas, 
and northeastern Pennsylvania. Areas of decreasing rates were seen in southern Texas, 
California, and the Dakotas. By 2014, age-standardized rates were lowest in counties in 
Colorado, Florida, Arizona, and 2 regions in Texas. The highest rates were observed in the 
South along the Mississippi River delta and in counties in Alabama, Georgia, North and 
South Carolina, Virginia, and Kentucky.
Uterine Cancer
From 1980 to 2014, 209 314 deaths due to uterine cancer were recorded in the United States. 
Uterine cancer mortality (Figure 7) declined in the United States by 16.1% (95% UI, 5.7%–
22.5%) from 2.5 (95% UI, 2.1–2.7) deaths per 100000 in 1980 to 2.1 (95% UI, 1.8–2.3) 
deaths per 100000 in 2014, but the decline was not steady. Whereas larger declines were 
seen in many counties in California, Colorado, Nevada, and Arkansas, there were clusters of 
counties with increasing rates in northern Maine, Iowa, Texas, the Carolinas, Virginia, and 
West Virginia. In 2014, the highest rates were observed in the regions that saw these 
increases as well as geographically related areas. In addition, high rates were seen in 
selected counties in Montana, New Hampshire, and Vermont.
Kidney Cancer
A total of 421 628 deaths due to kidney cancer were recorded between 1980 and 2014. 
National kidney cancer mortality (Figure 8) in 2014 (4.6 [95% UI, 4.4–4.8] deaths per 
100000) was essentially unchanged from 1980 (4.6 [95% UI, 4.4–4.7] deaths per 100000).

 There were considerable declines in the Northeast and southern Florida and a wide zone of 
increases covering most counties in the South and Midwest, as well as the Pacific Northwest 
and Utah. In 1980, the mortality rate ranged from 3.0 (95% UI, 2.5–3.5) per 100 000 in 
Honolulu County, Hawaii, to 9.5 (95% UI, 7.3–12.2) in Menominee County, Wisconsin, 
compared with a low of 2.1 (95% UI, 1.7–2.6) in Summit County, Colorado, and a high of 
9.7 (95% UI, 7.0–12.9) per 100000 in Buffalo County, South Dakota, in 2014. However, 
parts of Colorado and south Florida had very low rates. In 2014, several clusters of high 
mortality rates existed along the Mississippi Delta, Oklahoma, Texas, North and South 
Dakota, and counties in West Virginia, Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois. High rates were also 
observed in Alaska, as well as selected counties with large Native American populations in 
South Dakota, North Dakota, and the Four Corners area.
Liver Cancer
A total of 487 518 deaths due to liver cancer were recorded in the United States between 
1980 and 2014. Nationally, mortality rates from liver cancer (Figure 9) increased by 
87.6%(95% UI, 77.5%–97.4%) from 3.6 (95% UI, 3.5–3.8) deaths per 100000 in 1980 to 6.8 
(95% UI, 6.6–7.1) deaths per 100000 in 2014. In 1980, the mortality rates spanned from 
11.2 (95% UI, 7.1–16.6) in Kusilvak Census Area, Alaska, to 1.7 (95% UI, 1.3–2.1) in 
Summit County, Colorado. In 2014, the highest rate was 37.6 (95% UI, 30.7–44.3) in 
Anderson County, Texas, while the lowest rate was found to be 2.3 (95% UI, 1.7–3.1) in 
Summit County, Colorado. Almost all counties (3069) had significant increases in liver 
cancer death rates, and many of the counties on the West Coast and in New Mexico and 
West Texas had much larger increases. In 2014, there was a notable cluster of counties along 
the Mexico border in Texas with high rates; there were also high rates in a number of 
counties with large Native American populations in South Dakota, New Mexico, and Alaska.
Testicular Cancer
Between 1980 and 2014, 13 927 deaths due to testicular cancer were recorded. At the 
national level, the mortality rate from testicular cancer (Figure 10) decreased by 36.8% 
(95% UI, 29.3%–43.2%) between 1980 and 2014 from 0.2 (95% UI, 0.2–0.2) to 0.1 (95% 
UI, 0.1–0.1) deaths per 100 000 population. Rates of decline in men varied substantially 
across counties, from a decline of 72.1% (95% UI, 36.2%–88.7%) in Nantucket County, 
Massachusetts, to an increase of 39.3% (95% UI, −18.9% to 124.3%) in Union County, 
Florida. Greater declines were concentrated in New England. By 2014, testicular cancer 
mortality varied substantially across counties, with higher rates present in California and 
Nevada, as well as clusters in Texas, Missouri, and Michigan. However, lower rates were 
observed in parts of Colorado, Georgia (around the Atlanta area), the District of Columbia, 
and Minnesota (around the Minneapolis area).
Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
A total of 829 396 deaths due to non-Hodgkin lymphoma were recorded between 1980 and 
2014. Nationally, non-Hodgkin lymphoma (Figure 11) mortality was essentially unchanged 
between 1980 (8.3 [95% UI, 7.7–9.9] deaths per 100 000) and 2014 (8.3 [95% UI, 7.5–9.4] 
deaths per 100 000). Over the interval 1980 to 2014, age-standardized death rates increased 
substantially in a cluster of counties in West Virginia and eastern Kentucky and in a belt of

 counties from Alabama through South Carolina. At the same time, rates were declining in 
many counties in New England, Nevada, California, Florida, and Alaska. By 2014, low rates 
were observed in the Four Corners area, Alaska, and some counties on the Texas-Mexico 
border. Higher rates were interspersed throughout the Midwest, with areas of especially high 
rates in southern Louisiana, Michigan, Iowa, the Appalachian region, Indiana, Ohio, and 
Pennsylvania.
Other Cancers
Lip and oral cavity, nasopharynx, other pharynx, esophageal, stomach, gallbladder and 
biliary tract, larynx, malignant skin melanoma, nonmelanoma skin cancer, cervical, ovarian, 
bladder, brain and nervous system cancer, thyroid cancer, mesothelioma, Hodgkin 
lymphoma, multiple myeloma, leukemia, and other neoplasms are presented in eFigures 1–
23 in the Supplement. There were 5600727 deaths attributable to these cancers recorded 
between 1980 and 2014. Several patterns of differences existed among these cancers. For 
example, there were clear clusters in the Northeast, parts of northern Idaho and Montana, 
and parts of Oregon, northern California, and Nevada for bladder cancer mortality. 
Moreover, large clusters of brain and nervous system cancer were apparent in Washington, 
Oregon, Kentucky, and Tennessee, while Alaska and the Four Corners area had low rates. 
Thyroid cancer mortality clusters existed on the United States–Mexico border and in parts of 
the Dakotas.
Discussion
The study used an innovative, validated small area estimation approach to estimate age-
standardized cancer mortality rates for every county in the United States from 1980 to 2014. 
The findings show large differences in cancer mortality and the presence of clusters of high 
mortality rates. These local patterns would be masked if a national or a state number were 
provided. Moreover, the study was able to identify clusters of high rates of change among 
US counties, which is important for providing data to inform the debate on prevention, 
access to care, and appropriate treatment. Indeed, monitoring cancer mortality at the county 
level can help identify worsening incidence, inadequate access to quality treatment, or 
potentially other etiological factors involved.
The mortality rate from all cancers combined declined in most counties but increased in 
some. The pattern of changes across counties varied tremendously by type: for some 
cancers, mortality rates declined in nearly all counties (colon and rectum, larynx, lip and oral 
cavity, nasopharynx, other pharynx, stomach, gallbladder and biliary tract, breast, cervical, 
prostate, testicular, Hodgkin lymphoma) or increased in nearly all counties (liver, 
mesothelioma); for the remaining cancers, rates increased in some counties and declined in 
others. The policy response from the public health and medical care communities depends 
on parsing these trends into component factors: trends in cancer incidence driven by known 
risk factors, unexplained trends in incidence, cancers for which screening and early detection 
can make a major difference, and cancers for which high-quality treatment can make a major 
difference.

 There are several potential explanations for the high rates of cancer mortality in certain 
counties and regions. First, cancer incidence could be high due to a combination of risk 
factor profile and poor prevention and screening programs. Second, cancer detection 
happens at a late stage because of the interplay of lack of screening, awareness in the 
population and health care clinicians, and poor access to health care. Third, cancer treatment 
strategies are poor.
The findings showed large differences in breast cancer mortality rates and their decline from 
1980 to 2014. At the national level, previous studies reported a stable increase in breast 
cancer incidence from 1943 to 1979 followed by a rapid increase from 1980 to 1999 and a 
sharp decline from 2000.24 Several factors led to this decline in incidence, including earlier 
detection and improved treatment.25 Several well-known risk factors for breast cancer, such 
as postmenopausal obesity and alcohol consumption, increased in the past 20 years, while 
physical activity remained unchanged.9,20,26 There is a need for comprehensive breast 
cancer care that includes prevention efforts, awareness building, adequate coverage of breast 
cancer screening, access to care, effective systems for timely and accurate diagnoses, and 
availability of surgical services, radiotherapy, medical oncology, genetic counseling, and 
palliative care.
Six cancers had 5-year survival rates (as reported by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and 
End Results program) higher than 85%, and these survival rates improved substantially in 
recent decades22,23: testicular cancer, thyroid cancer, prostate cancer, melanoma, Hodgkin 
lymphoma, and breast cancer. The results for these cancers can perhaps be used as a marker 
for access to quality care. For example, 5-year survival of testicular cancer is approaching 
96%, suggesting that early detection and treatment are the main drivers behind observed 
differences. This study showed high mortality rates for testicular cancer in areas bordering 
Mexico, which have also experienced slower rates of decline than other areas of the country. 
Several studies have previously reported an increased incidence of testicular cancer among 
Hispanics, which maybe related to a range of risk exposures27; nevertheless, with such 
highly effective treatment available, the high rates in these communities raise questions 
about access to quality care.
When considering prostate cancer survival, the effect of screening, overdiagnosis, and lead-
time bias clearly must be taken into account. Current guidelines recommend either against 
prostate cancer screening28 or to individualize prostate-specific antigen screening for high-
risk patients.29 The US Preventive Services Task Force is working on an update of their 
prostate cancer screening guidelines looking into differences in prostate-specific antigen 
screening effectiveness within subpopulations, including race.30 It is unclear how much of 
the mortality difference in counties is based on differences in incidence vs differences in 
access to treatment. However, given the significant advances that have been made in the 
treatment of certain cancers, local health care systems have to ensure that these treatment 
advances are accessible in areas of high incidence.
Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer incidence and mortality.31 In the United States, 
smoking rates among women peaked after those among men.7 As a result, the peak in 
smoking-related cancer mortality also occurred earlier for men than for women. Although

 tobacco smoking prevalence is declining nationally, it remains very high in parts of the 
South,7 where there were clusters of high cancer mortality. Also, many rural areas still have 
high rates of smoking compared with urban areas.7 Moreover, recent studies have shown that 
cigar smoking and use of smokeless tobacco are increasing in the United States.32 Local 
efforts to reduce smoking in poor and rural areas are needed to reduce the burden of 
smoking-related cancer and other diseases.
Obesity is a major risk factor for cancer.20 Rates of overweight and obesity have increased 
steadily in the United States, and recent studies have shown that adult obesity levels 
continue to increase.9,33 Moreover, higher obesity rates have been documented in the 
southern parts of the United States.9 Women and African Americans have the highest rates 
of overweight and obesity.8 Indeed, obesity is a major health challenge for the United States 
and may drive differences among counties in health outcomes. Renewed efforts to reduce 
overweight and obesity are needed with a focus on weight maintenance as a first step.34
Diet is another risk factor for cancer mortality.20 Dietary intake in the United States has not 
improved much since the 1980s.35 Moreover, fast food quality is not improving, with the 
exception of french fries.36 Although recent dietary intake studies in the United States show 
a sign of improvement37 and a decline in consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages,38 US 
residents are not doing enough to improve their diets. Unfortunately, there are no adequate 
data on dietary consumption at the local level. The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance 
System39 included few questions on fruit and vegetable consumption, which did not allow a 
proper dietary analysis. Improving and monitoring dietary intake in the United States should 
be a priority for local, state, and federal agencies.
This study has several limitations. First, US death registration may not have captured every 
death, and the population counts and covariates used may be subject to error. Second, 
garbage codes were reassigned to other causes, which may lead to error in the estimates. 
Third, the garbage code redistribution methods used in this analysis have not been validated 
against a gold standard such as autopsy because of insufficient data. Fourth, although the 
garbage code redistribution methods used in this analysis may be subject to error, this 
uncertainty is difficult to quantify and has not been accounted for in the reported uncertainty 
intervals. Fifth, the models smooth mortality rates over space, time, and age and may result 
in an underestimation of inequalities. However, consistent methods were used to provide 
cancer mortality over an extended period, allowing health care professionals to compare 
across time and counties.
Conclusions
Cancer mortality declined overall in the United States between 1980 and 2014. Over this 
same period, there were important changes in trends, patterns, and differences in cancer 
mortality among US counties. These patterns may inform further research into improving 
prevention and treatment.

 Key Points
Question
What are the trends and differences in cancer mortality rates among United States 
counties from 1980 to 2014?
Findings
In this population-based modeling study of deidentified death records from the National 
Center for Health Statistics, cancer mortality decreased by a relative 20.1% between 1980 
and 2014; however, there were substantial differences among counties throughout this 
period. For many cancers, there were distinct clusters of counties in different regions with 
especially high mortality.
Meaning
From 1980–2014, there were important changes in trends, patterns, and differences in 
cancer mortality among US counties.
