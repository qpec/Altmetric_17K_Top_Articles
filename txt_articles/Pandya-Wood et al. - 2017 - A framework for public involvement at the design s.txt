Plain English summary
Researchers who conduct studies in health and social care are encouraged to involve
the public as early as possible in the process of designing their studies. Before their
studies are allowed to start researchers must seek approval from a Research Ethics
Committee, which will assess whether the study is going to be safe and ethical for
patients or healthy volunteers to take part in. The process of ethical review does
not consider how researchers work with patients and the public early on to design
their studies. Furthermore, there is no requirement for researchers to seek ethical
approval for public involvement. However, in our work advising researchers about
public involvement we have found that the ways in which researchers involve the
public in the design of their studies are sometimes unintentionally unethical, and
this is the focus of our paper. We have observed ten areas where ethical issues may
arise because of the actions researchers may or may not take and which might
consequently have a negative impact. Therefore, we have used these observations to
develop a “framework” to help researchers and the public work together at the early
design stage in ways that are ethical. Our intention for the framework is to help
researchers be mindful of these ten areas and how easily ethical issues can arise. The
framework suggests some ways to overcome the potential issues in each of the ten
areas. The ten areas are: 1) Allocating sufficient time for public involvement; 2)
Avoiding tokenism; 3) Registering research design stage public involvement work
with NHS Research & Development Trust Office at earliest opportunity; 4)
Communicating clearly from the outset; 5) Entitling public contributors to stop
their involvement for any unstated reasons; 6) Operating fairness of opportunity; 7)
Differentiating qualitative research methods and public involvement activities; 8)
Working sensitively; 9) Being conscious of confidentiality and 10) Valuing, acknowledging
and rewarding public involvement.
We looked to see whether any other similar approaches to helping researchers address
potential ethical issues when working with the public on designing studies have been
published and to our knowledge none exist. Our framework is presented as a draft and
believe that it would now benefit from input from researchers and the public to gauge
how useful it is and whether there are any other possible situations that it might
need to cover.

Abstract
The current paper highlights real life examples of how ethical issues can arise
during public involvement activities at the research design stage. We refer to “the
research design stage” as the time between the generation of the research ideas
and when formal permissions to start the work including ethical approval are
granted. We argue that although most researchers work ethically at this early stage,
some may still benefit from being informed about ethically conscious approaches
to involving the public.
The paper highlights 10 ethical issues that we have observed with involving the
public at the research design stage. We provide examples of these observed
scenarios to illustrate the issues and make suggestions for how they can be avoided
to help researchers become more ethically conscious when involving the public at
the research design stage. Currently the draft framework comprises: 1) Allocating
sufficient time for public involvement; 2) Avoiding tokenism; 3) Registering research
design stage public involvement work with NHS Research & Development Trust
Office at earliest opportunity; 4) Communicating clearly from the outset; 5) Entitling
public contributors to stop their involvement for any unstated reasons; 6) Operating
fairness of opportunity; 7) Differentiating qualitative research methods and public
involvement activities; 8) Working sensitively; 9) Being conscious of confidentiality
and 10) Valuing, acknowledging and rewarding public involvement.
The draft framework will help researchers to recognise the ethical issues when
involving the public and is intended to be used voluntarily in a self-regulatory way.
We believe that the draft framework requires further consultation and input from
the wider research community and the public before endorsement by national UK
bodies such as INVOLVE and the Health Research Authority (HRA).

Background
Public involvement work that has shaped the content of this paper
This paper is an opinion piece informed by the authors’ (RPW, DB) first-hand ex-
periences of providing advice on involving the public as part of our National Insti-
tute for Health Research (NIHR) Research Design Service (RDS) roles. It also
builds on consultations with approximately 20 lay people and 25 researchers during
public involvement workshops held in the last 3 years in the East Midlands region.
Prior to this, approximately 20 lay people and researchers gave input to early dis-
cussions on this topic at the 2010 INVOLVE national conference [1]. Finally, two lay
people have read and commented on this paper prior to submission to the journal.
Introduction
Our experience as research advisers tells us that it takes researchers anything between six
and twelve months or more to develop research applications. The “research design stage”
we refer to throughout the paper concerns the time between the generation of research
ideas right through to the point when formal ethical and other approval processes have
begun (see Fig. 1 below) and includes involvement of the public from the earliest stage.
The ‘Public involvement in research: values and principles framework’ [2] developed by
INVOLVE [3], the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) body advising on and
promoting public involvement in England, states under their first principle ‘respect’ that:
Pandya-Wood et al. Research Involvement and Engagement  (2017) 3:6 
Page 2 of 21
 “Public members are involved in the ideas phase of the research, working with researchers
and others to discuss priorities and research questions; public members help to make de-
cisions about the research protocol and ethics application; public members review and
provide feedback on grant applications” [2]. Therefore, the research design stage or “ideas
phase” is a particularly valuable period for public involvement activities [4].
Such early public involvement activities have clearly reported impacts on, among
other aspects, the research design and delivery [5] and add value to a study [6].
However, ethical issues can arise when involving the public at the research design stage
and, in our experience, some researchers do not appear to be aware of them. We have
used our experiences as research advisors to draft a framework to address these
research design stage ethical issues.
Most of this paper has been shaped to address ethical issues concerning research ap-
plications being developed for national peer-reviewed funding competitions. We antici-
pate that the framework will be useful to any researcher.
We follow the definition of public involvement from INVOLVE: “doing research
with or by people, not to, about or for them.” [7] What this means for health
researchers is to meaningfully engage with people and to ask members of the pub-
lic generally or those with lived experiences of a health condition and/or their
carers for their input on research and then acting on that ‘lay’ feedback. When
using the term ‘public’ we include patients, potential patients, carers and people
who use health and social care services as well as people from organisations that
represent people who use services [7]. By ‘ethics’ we mean “the rules of conduct
and moral principles recognized in respect to a class of human actions or a group,
culture, etc.” [8]. Similarly, ‘research ethics’ “refers to the moral principles guiding
research from its inception through to completion and publication of results” [9],
which can also be defined as the “fostering of research that protects the interests
of
the
public”
[10]
and
includes
research
participants
and

researchers
themselves.

The above figure illustrates the stages of public involvement before a study is funded or approved to start. We
believe an ethically conscious framework is required to help researchers understand the ethical issues that can
arise prior to stage 1

 We have drawn up a framework of 10 ethical considerations that can occur when
researchers involve the public at the research design stage. These are intended to
act as a checklist to help sensitise researchers and the public to ethically conscious
working.
Our proposed framework has, after initial consultation, expanded from just three
ethical issues in 2010 [1] to 10 issues in its current form, but we acknowledge it
still may not be exhaustive. We are inviting input from the entire readership, par-
ticularly the public and researchers to help further develop and clarify the frame-
work and related suggested approaches to addressing the issues.
Main text
Public involvement policy
The growth in public involvement across UK public services and health and social
care research is linked to the increase in policy initiatives around citizenship, dem-
ocracy and rights [11]. In the last decade, public involvement has become a key
requisite in applied health research in the UK [12] and the commitment to this
policy has been operationalised by the UK government in many ways. For example,
the context for public involvement in the NIHR is shifting rapidly from health and
social care reform to changes in the way research is conducted. There is also a
growing awareness within the healthcare industry of the benefits that public in-
volvement can bring to their research, resulting in increased involvement reported
in applications for ethical review in recent years. However, the level is still very
low compared to non-commercially funded research [13].
The Breaking the Boundaries strategic review of public involvement in the
NIHR in 2014 resulted in the Going the Extra Mile (GEM) [14] report. This
highlighted 11 recommendations for new ways of working in public involvement
but none cover ethical conduct at the research design stage. At an operational
level, our frontline experience of research design work suggests that ethical issues
can and do arise at the research design stage. Sensitive and ethical working is re-
quired to ensure that research design stage activities are rooted in good practice
and informed by first-hand experiences of the public who have been involved at
this stage.
Statutory policies relating to the ethical conduct of health and social care research
The Health Research Authority (HRA) and the Devolved Administrations for
Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have consulted on and will shortly be
issuing a new UK Policy Framework for Health and Social Care Research [15]
which will replace the Research Governance Framework for Health and Social Care
[12]. The new policy framework (shortly to be introduced) sets out the high-level
principles of good practice in the management and conduct of health and social
care research in the UK, as well as the responsibilities that underpin high-quality
ethical research. Part of this is the requirement for health and social care re-
searchers conducting most types of research in the NHS to submit their study for
ethical review by an NHS Research Ethics Committee (REC) within the UK Health
Departments’ Research Ethics Service. The Research Ethics Service (RES) is a core
Pandya-Wood et al. Research Involvement and Engagement  (2017) 3:6 
Page 4 of 21
 function of the HRA and is committed to enabling and supporting ethical research
in the NHS. The RES is not responsible for university research ethics committees,
although they work to similar standards and governance procedures, and they are
not included in what we refer to as ethical or REC approval in this paper. The
RES has two functions: 1) to protect the rights, safety, dignity and wellbeing of re-
search participants and 2) to facilitate and promote ethical research that benefits
participants, science and society [16]. The HRA clearly value public involvement
stating that “involving patients and the public in health research will improve it by
ensuring it is relevant to the needs of patients and more likely to have an impact
on their health and wellbeing.” [17] (para B2; p.14).
The current Research Governance Framework and new policy frameworks are
the only policies that cover what researchers do in designing new research studies
(through the responsibilities of chief investigators, research teams, sponsors and
employers). However, they do not contain anything specifically focused on how re-
searchers work with the public to design and then conduct their studies.
RECs review applications for research and give an opinion about whether the
proposed research is ethical and will protect the rights, safety, dignity and well-
being of research participants. RECs also consider the safety and well-being of re-
searchers and whether they have the relevant skills and experience to both conduct
the research and to assess and deal with possible risks. Any ethical issues related
to how researchers work with the public will be considered with respect to how
the proposed research will be conducted rather than how the public were involved
in designing it.
Ethical approval should in theory only be granted if everything that has led up to
the application has been done in an ethically acceptable way. However, ethical re-
view happens quite late in the research cycle, after funding has been approved, and
the process focuses on what the research will do and not on how it was designed.
We know through our own work that ethical, good practice and governance issues
can, and do arise early on at the research design stage. REC approval is granted on
the understanding that ethical principles are understood by researchers throughout
the research cycle, but we are concerned that there is no existing specific policy or
guidance relating to public involvement at the research design stage.
Guidance relating to public involvement in research and research ethics committee
review and potential areas of confusion
In May 2016, the HRA and INVOLVE issued an updated joint statement on public in-
volvement in research and research ethics committee review highlighting that:
“You do not need to apply for ethical approval to involve the public in the planning
or the design stage of research… even when those people are approached for this role
via the NHS…” [18] (p.2).
There is an inherent risk that, when communicating that ethical approval for public
involvement in the research design stage is not required, the message researchers may
hear is that there are no ethical issues to be considered with respect to the public in-
volvement at this stage. However, it is simply that public involvement activity in the re-
search design stage does not fall within the statutory responsibilities of a REC, not that
Pandya-Wood et al. Research Involvement and Engagement  (2017) 3:6 
Page 5 of 21
 there are no ethical issues to consider. The point we make is that all formal good
practice checks come only after funding is obtained rather than before and our
concern is that sometimes ethical oversights might occur if the researcher is not
mindful of the issues we highlight in the framework. Our observations from advis-
ing researchers at the research design stage suggest that ethical issues can occur in
health and social care research much earlier than when a decision is made to fund
the study.
There may also be researchers who are concerned that having close contact with
people during the research design stage may by default require ethical approval
since this level of contact with the public (who are also patients) may be no dif-
ferent to collecting research data. It is possible that some researchers are unaware
of the HRA and INVOLVE joint statement. The update and clarification of the
statement by the HRA and INVOLVE are, in part, welcome but wider communi-
cation may still be necessary, particularly, that ethical approval is not required at
the research design stage.
Our proposed framework intends to clarify this grey area and could, once it has
gained wider consultation and acceptance, be endorsed and signposted by the HRA
and INVOLVE. If the framework is endorsed in this way and becomes widely and vol-
untarily used in a self-regulatory way, there is no need for a new formal process for
reviewing public involvement in the research design stage.
The early involvement of the public at the research design stage is regarded by many
as being valuable [5] and is clearly valued by INVOLVE and the HRA. For example, the
briefing note that was issued to accompany the new HRA and INVOLVE joint state-
ment on the ‘impact of public involvement on the ethical aspects of research’ [19]
stresses that:
“Public involvement right at the beginning of a project helps researchers to identify
new research topics and to modify their research questions…Involving the public early
on…also helps researchers design and conduct their research in a way that potential
participants consider to be ethically acceptable.” [19] (p.2).
However, while public involvement is recognised by INVOLVE and the HRA in
helping to produce more “ethically acceptable” research there is no guidance pertaining
to the ethical conduct of the research design stage concerning public involvement
itself.
The new HRA and INVOLVE briefing note and joint statement highlights situa-
tions where the involvement of the public can pose ethical concerns. However, all
the scenarios listed (e.g. helping to conduct interviews) relate to contact with par-
ticipants or study data and would only happen once the study is funded and un-
derway and not at the research design stage. Although researchers are required to
detail in their ethical review application form how the public have contributed to
the design of the study, the focus of ethical review is the future operation and con-
duct of the research and on “…how the public will be involved in…the research”
[18] (p. 2, italics added), rather than how they have been involved at the research
design stage.
The public involvement activities we focus on at the research design stage include
the involvement of the public in the ‘design and development of research’
, which is not
covered by ethical review. This is partly because of the REC focus on how the research
Pandya-Wood et al. Research Involvement and Engagement  (2017) 3:6 
Page 6 of 21
 will be conducted and partly because there is rarely any detailed information in-
cluded in an application that would give a REC cause for concern about the way
that researchers have worked with the public. The HRA and INVOLVE joint state-
ment says that “Involving the public in the design and development of research
does not generally raise ethical concerns” [18]. However, our proposed framework
currently highlights 10 potential areas related to the research design stage where
we have observed ethical issues and which are related to the ways that researchers
work with the public. There may well be others we have yet to be made aware of
via further consultation.
Differentiating between public involvement activities and qualitative research methods
In our experience, some researchers are unclear about the distinction between qualita-
tive research methods and public involvement activities. It is possible that if researchers
believe they are undertaking “interviews” when they are actually consulting the public
at the research design stage then they may, erroneously, believe they require ethical ap-
proval. Defining and referring to information collected during public involvement con-
sultations as “data” [20] is not very helpful and ethically is confusing. The use of
language to refer to the research design stage is a point we address in the proposed
framework and should help allay these concerns. Conscious attempts by researchers to
deliberately combine qualitative research methods with public involvement early on
[20] are, we believe, misguided. Any apparent “interface” between public involvement
and qualitative research would be best acknowledged but kept separate. Engaging the
public as research participants and treating their verbal contributions as data would al-
ways, in our minds, necessitate the gaining of ethical approval. This would, we believe,
also apply if the information gained from consulting the public in the research design
stage is presented as qualitative research data. The next iteration of the INVOLVE/
HRA joint statement could be broadened to clarify these issues. We think this would
be helpful.
In addition, the potential may be heightened for the public to be confused (or misled)
at any time regarding their roles. Are the public always clear, for example when public
involvement and qualitative research methods are being combined? More importantly
are they clear when they are contributing through a public involvement role and when
they are engaged as research participants? Researchers need to be clear about their pur-
pose in consulting the public. If it is to acquire information to answer, in some way or
other, their research question (s) then what they are doing is research and it needs
ethical approval. However, if it is to help them design, conduct and or manage their
study then that is involvement and does not need ethical approval.
The literature supporting our case
We scoped the available literature for guidance explicitly addressing good practice
(or what we refer to as ethically conscious) public involvement at the research
design stage but we could not find anything. This adds support to our view that
the issues we raise are being overlooked. However, we found four papers that dis-
cussed good practice concerning ethical issues related to public involvement in
general.
Pandya-Wood et al. Research Involvement and Engagement  (2017) 3:6 
Page 7 of 21
 Eight ethical considerations when involving the public in research were devised
by Wright et al. [21] and accompanies their critical appraisal guidance as a standa-
lone resource (p. 365). This resonates with good public involvement practice, but
was designed for use by funders or journal reviewers (i.e. once the public involve-
ment activities have already taken place). They were not intended, as far as we are
aware, to specifically help guide the development of the research design stage as
we are suggesting with our framework. However, we acknowledge useful elements
contained in Wright et al’s [21] ‘ethical considerations’ but we feel the research de-
sign stage still requires its own ethical focus. Wright et al’s [21] guidance is being
further developed to include assessments of funding proposals including ethical is-
sues in research design [22].
Various public involvement toolkits exist providing advice on ways of involving the
public in research (see Bagley et al., 2016 for an overview) [23]. For example, the
Guidance for Reporting Involvement of Patients and Public (GRIPP) [24] checklist was
developed to assist authors and reviewers in writing and assessing public involvement
papers and reports (i.e. once the study is complete). It does not include an assessment
of ethical issues, which may be addressed in its successor, GRIPP2 (yet to be published).
The Public Involvement Impact Assessment Framework (PiiAF) [25] was designed to
help researchers consider and work through a plan to capture any impact of public in-
volvement. Researchers are guided to consider the values around public involvement in
research at interpersonal, organisational and societal levels which are likely to impact
on good practice at the research design stage (including issues of respect and trust).
However, there is no direct reference to ethical considerations within PiiAF.
INVOLVE’s Values and Principles Framework [2] covers six areas for organisations,
researchers and the public to consider for involvement at any stage of the research.
While reference is made within the framework to the research design stage or “ideas
phase” of research, it is meant for use across the life cycle of research. Brief mention is
made of the need to involve the public from the outset (including being involved in the
protocol development and ethics application) and to acknowledge their contribution.
While the values and principles framework contains much of value only a few of the
values resonate with the best practice we are proposing. Uniquely, our framework
focuses solely on the research design stage, or “ideas phase”, which we believe requires
quite separate and specific attention.
Also worthy of consideration here are two further papers. The first, the current con-
sultation on ‘Standards for Citizen Science’ drawn up by a network of European univer-
sities [26], proposes that researchers ensure the rights and welfare of the public at any
stage of their participation which can include: “…topic selection and development, re-
search design, execution, dissemination of results and funding.” [25] (p.3). The second
paper sets out ethical guidelines for patient groups contributing evidence to the devel-
opment of health technology assessments [27]. These guidelines cover elements of our
proposed framework but are not focused on the potential ethical issues that researchers
might encounter when involving the public at the research design stage. Both papers
appear relevant to our own framework and we intend to stay informed of their
development.
The above literature helps to contextualise our proposed framework and highlights
its unique position in the discussions regarding the research design stage. We know
Pandya-Wood et al. Research Involvement and Engagement  (2017) 3:6 
Page 8 of 21
 that there is a gap in dealing with ethical issues at this stage and our framework com-
plements existing information. Our concern is that ethically conscious approaches to
public involvement at the research design stage require clarity. There is little value in
attempting to replicate other work that overlaps with our own. Our proposed frame-
work could be readily incorporated into existing public involvement toolkits that aim
to aid the planning, support and evaluation of public involvement and could be sign-
posted as an additional resource within other documents or toolkits, (e.g. in the pilot
clinical trials public involvement toolkit [23]). Website links to other useful resources
within our proposed framework have been included (see Table 1). Feedback on add-
itional useful resources that could be signposted within our framework would be
welcomed.
An ethically conscious framework for public involvement at the research design stage
The following 10 ethical issues relating to involving the public have been observed at
the research design stage by the authors and confirmed in various public involvement
discussions and workshops. We flag them as points of concern, and suggest that our
accompanying framework could address each of them in turn. The issues we highlight
are examples drawn from working with researchers or experienced by the public who
have been involved at the design stage. The framework has been formulated to address
potential ethical issues at the research design stage sequentially in the order that we
think they are most likely to arise in practice. Each of the issues is illustrated with a
scenario drawn from real situations we have observed. As indicated above, we looked
for references to each issue grounded in established principles, frameworks or codes of
conduct but were unable to find any that deal specifically with the relationship between
professional researchers and public contributors. The sources we found are concerned
with the relationship between either health and social care professionals and their pa-
tients or service users or between professional researchers and participants in their
studies. However, we have cited principles we found that are transferrable and relevant
to the relationship between professional researchers and public contributors. Feedback
on the framework order and structure would also be welcome.
Allocating sufficient time for public involvement
This idea of allocating sufficient time for public involvement in research ethics is not
grounded in any previous ethical principles we have come across; however, we believe
that this idea is embedded in the fundamental ethical principle of respect [2, 28]. The
ethical issue we have observed: “Can you ask two people in your group to read this by
tomorrow. I am submitting the bid the next day” (Researcher).
Allowing time for the recruitment of the public to take part in public involvement ac-
tivities is crucial [5]. Time allocated for public involvement activities (e.g. when recruit-
ing the public to take part in consultations and the time allocated for the length of
those discussions) needs careful consideration. Allocating insufficient time for research
design activities may suggest researchers are unlikely to incorporate meaningful input
into their study and that they are not fully engaged or invested in public involvement.
Inadequate allocation of time could result in public involvement not having the optimal
impact on the proposal and may contribute to stress and burden felt by those involved

Areas of concern for Public Involvement at
the Research Design Stage
Potential Ethical Issues for Involving the Public at the
Research Design Stage
Suggested Solutions, including any related guidance
that is available.
1).
Allocating sufficient time for public
involvement
Inadequate allocation of time could result in public
involvement not having the fullest impact upon the
funding application and may contribute to stress and
burden felt by those involved.
Building in realistic timelines, including at the research
design stage: for example, offering the public involved at
least two weeks to read and feedback on a funding application.
2).
Avoiding tokenism
When preparing a funding proposal public involvement
activities at the research design stage are only listed in
a ‘tick box’ (e.g. Stage 1 of the RfPB application process)
without providing details anywhere else in the application.
Make any public contributions visible. Detail throughout the
research application how the public have been involved in the
research design stage and what difference it made. Who was
involved? What did they do and contribute? How exactly did
their input help shape the research proposal?
Funding bodies to provide guidance on how and where research
design stage public involvement activities could be “woven”
throughout the application form? (e.g. how to supplement the
public involvement tick box information for NIHR RfPB stage 1).
3).
Registering of research design stage public
involvement work early with NHS Research
and Development (R&D) Trust Office
Trust R&D offices not being informed of research design
stage public involvement funding (e.g. RDS Public
Involvement Fund) and that involvement of the public
may sometimes occur on NHS premises (which may raise
indemnity issues).
INVOLVE recommend that organisations and researchers include
the governance of public involvement in their research
accountability. Trust R&D offices can provide practical support
around local governance arrangements.
4).
Communicating clearly from the outset
Not communicating clearly about public involvement roles
and expectations at the research design stage can lead to
disengaged and disenfranchised members of the public,
unable to contribute to the study.
The public involved at the research design stage require the
same information as the rest of the research team, but
communicated in ways that they can access and understand.
Use plain English to inform the public about the study and
public involvement roles and responsibilities (verbally and/or print)
to help people make informed decisions about becoming involved
in the first instance (including research design stage). This is more
likely to help them to be well informed and remain engaged.
In consultative activities some group members can
dominate if the consultation is not facilitated skilfully
leading to some people not being able to communicate
their ideas.

5).
Entitling public contributors to stop their
involvement for any unstated reason (s)
In order that the public who get involved do not
become overwhelmed by what they are asked to do
Inform lay people early on that they can cease their
involvement activities (including research design) at any
time and without detailing their reasons for so doing
See also: Wright et al. (2010) [21] Table 2. P.365:
DOI: 10.1111/j.1369-7625.2010.00607.x
6).
Operating ‘fairness of opportunity’
Not taking issues around diversity and inclusion into
account at the research design stage may result in
disempowering, discriminatory research.
Respecting and valuing all forms of difference in individuals.
If a research question is specific to a particular group or
community, it is in the researcher’s interests to specifically
engage and consult that community at the research
design stage.
7).
Differentiating between public
involvement activities and qualitative
research methods
Reference to research design stage public involvement
activities (e.g. consultations) using research terminology
can confuse those who get involved about whether
they are helping design the research or are participants
in the research. It may also lead to conflicts of interest.
Avoid research terminology (e.g. ‘focus groups’) when
referring to consultative public involvement activities.
Do not combine qualitative research methods and public
involvement activities; keep them separate. There is no
reason why those who are involved in a study cannot also
participate in some aspect of it but the difference needs to
be made explicit. Researchers should also carefully consider
whether this might present those involved with any
potential conflicts of interest.
Research Design Services (RDS) can help advise on the use
of qualitative research methods and consistent practice and
terminology in involving the public at the research design stage.
Ambiguity around terminology may be linked to
lack of clarity about exactly when ethical approval
is required.

Working sensitively
Some of those involved at the research design stage may
find the experience emotionally upsetting (particularly
those with lived/carer experience of the condition under
investigation). They may be reminded of negative health
experiences or learn of risk factors or negative long term
consequences of their condition for the first time. They may
Researchers need to avoid emotionally upsetting, sensitive
situations and undertake public involvement sensitively at
all times (including at the research design stage) especially
with those with lived/carer experience of the condition under
investigation and vulnerable people. Counselling or other support
may be required. Additional time may be required if those
involved are too unwell to perform their tasks.

Being conscious of confidentiality
Disclosure of personal, sensitive information during
research design consultations (particularly when these
take place in a group) can occur.
Ensure that a confidential environment is fostered at the
beginning of every research design consultation. If the
discussions are audio recorded, the reason for this and
how the information will be used must be made clear.
Permissions will need to be gained and confidentiality
assured. See also area 7 above: if the information that
was recorded is to be used to answer the research question
in any way then this is research not involvement and ethical
approval will be needed [18].
Permissions to record the consultation may be
overlooked.
Research ideas may be disclosed by public reviewers
who have not been appropriately instructed about
protocol confidentiality.
When the public are involved in reviewing protocols those
doing so must adhere to a confidentiality agreement in the
same way as any other reviewers.

Valuing, acknowledging and rewarding
public involvement
Not valuing, acknowledging and rewarding the
contributions of the public involved at the research
design stage may lead to them feeling disempowered
and marginalised.
Value and acknowledge public involvement at the research
design stage by faithfully capturing contributions from the
public in the research proposal and also via individual
reward and recognition (i.e. payment; training opportunities)
Out of pocket payments should be offered. Alert researchers
to RDS Public Involvement Funding (available for research
design consultations).
There can be financial burdens for those involved at
the research design stage, which if not addressed may
deter people from getting involved.

 [29]. For example, we feel that the public involved should be offered at least 2 weeks to
review a proposal, so that they can fully think about their feedback. This resonates with
INVOLVE’s support value highlighted in their Values and Principles Framework [2] and
the need to build in realistic timelines to the research process, which we stress needs to
commence at the research design stage.
Avoiding tokenism
The issue of tokenism in research ethics concerning public involvement was raised in
Ward et al., 2009 [30] as well as being embedded in the fundamental ethical principle
of respect [28].
The ethical issue we have observed: “The patients’ group didn’t really get what we are
doing so I haven’t included their suggestions in the bid.” (Researcher).
There are concerns that public involvement is frequently undertaken in a tokenistic
manner [21]. Demonstrating involvement in funding applications is sometimes treated
by researchers as unimportant and a ‘box ticking’ exercise [31, 32]. The new National
Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Research for Patient Benefit (RfPB) 2 stage appli-
cation process (which came in to effect in December 2015) in which public involve-
ment is detailed at stage 1 in an involvement tick box is regarded by some as
retrograde since no additional written evidence is required. In addition, researchers de-
claring that they have undertaken public involvement ‘consultations’ (i.e. one of the
RfPB tick box options) may be treated by some as one of the ‘easiest’ of the three
recognised ways (i.e. consultation, collaboration and user-led) in which people can be
involved at the research design stage [33]. Choosing the ‘consultation’ tick box option
should not be a convenient way of getting public involvement ‘brownie points’. One
way of demonstrating good practice is by explaining in the research application how
exactly research design public involvement has occurred and what difference it made to
the proposal. Detailing who was involved and what they did along with exactly how the
input was used, and how it shaped the research proposal should be woven throughout
the relevant sections of a funding application form. Guidance from funders such as the
NIHR on where and how to “weave” public involvement throughout the funding pro-
posal to substantiate the tick box information would be useful.
Registering of research design stage public involvement work early with NHS Research
and Development (R&D) Trust Office
The registering of public involvement in R&D is a governance issue and we believe
grounded in the fundamental ethical principles of safety [12, 15] and transparency
[34, 35]. The ethical issue we have observed: “I don’t need to inform my R&D office
of my public involvement activity until the research gets funded” (Researcher).
Early registering of research design stage public involvement work with NHS Trust
Research and Development (R&D) offices should afford the researchers with practical
and administrative support around local governance arrangements. R&D offices may be
able to facilitate advice on NHS indemnity and whether specific statements apply to
cover groups, such as non-employees or members of the public. However, ‘blanket
cover’ should not be assumed (e.g. GPs are independent contractors and have their
own indemnity providers). R&D offices are likely to be keen to be informed of any

 research design stage consultation funding awarded for public involvement activities
(e.g. RDS Public Involvement Funds) since they will be responsible for the timely reim-
bursement of the public involved. INVOLVE recommend that organisations and re-
searchers include the governance of public involvement in their research accountability
policies (Value 6: Accountability) [2]. We believe these policies should be made explicit
and include the research design stage. Early involvement and support from the
Research and Governance infrastructure will also be valuable when planning public in-
volvement as co-researchers throughout a study and the accompanying organisational
and administrative issues this pose.
Communicating clearly from the outset
The idea behind clear communication in research is grounded in the fundamental
ethical principle of transparency [34], where research is open to public scrutiny through
the publication of protocols and all results [35],. The ethical issue we have observed: “I
was pleased to be involved early on but I really did not understand what I was being
asked to do. Not enough effort was made to explain things to me. I felt left out of the
discussions”. (Public contributor).
The public involved at the research design stage require the same information as
the rest of the research team, but communicated in ways that they can access and
understand. Potentially, not clarifying expectations early on can deter people from
getting involved at the research design stage [36]. Details of the commitment re-
quired and potential burden of public involvement activities should also be com-
municated early on [5]. Providing adequate information about the study and about
involvement roles and responsibilities verbally and/or in print is necessary and ap-
propriate and helps people make informed decisions about becoming involved in
the first instance and is likely to help them remain involved [5]. This may also in-
clude the necessity for clear communication early on about planned roles for the
public as members of the research team (e.g. as co-researchers) in order to be
clear about expectations later in the study and how people may require support to
undertake these roles [37]. Linked to the issue of clear communication is a re-
searcher’s need for facilitation skills (which differ to clinical interactions), to effectively
capture all contributions when involving the public especially when some people may be
more dominant than others [5].
Entitling public contributors to stop their involvement for any unstated reasons
In research ethics, the idea of withdrawing from research is a well-grounded fundamen-
tal ethical principle for participants in studies and concerns respecting people’s wishes
to stop doing something that they no longer wish to do [34, 38]. While the focus of that
is on research participants the principle is equally relevant to public contributors or
other members of a research team. The ethical issue we have observed: A member of
the public saying to a research colleague, “I have agreed to help design a study but I
really feel overwhelmed by the amount of things they are asking me to do, I honestly
haven’t got any more time and don’t want to continue but I feel like I have to help be-
cause I said I would – Initially they said it would be one meeting and so far I have had
four two-hour long meetings with them”. (Public contributor).
Pandya-Wood et al. Research Involvement and Engagement  (2017) 3:6 
Page 14 of 21
 It is important that the public know that they can stop their involvement at any time
and without detailing their reasons for so doing (in a similar way that applies to re-
search participants). Following number 4 above, this may be a issue if roles and expec-
tations have not been adequately communicated early on. It should be made explicit
from the outset that the public can stop their involvement at any time.
Operating ‘fairness of opportunity’
The value of fairness is enshrined in equalities legislation. Researching diverse
groups and individuals falls within the fundamental ethical principle of respect
[28], which includes equality of opportunity [35]. The ethical issue we have ob-
served: “My study is about young black and minority ethnic children but I can’t
find any.” (Researcher).
The backgrounds of who is involved at the research design stage are important to
consider. If a research question is specific to a group or community, it is in the
researcher’s interests to specifically seek to engage that community. Similarly, if the re-
search question affects a broad group of people then the researcher needs to involve a
broader group, considering inclusivity and diversity. INVOLVE define inclusivity and
diversity as ‘respecting and valuing all forms of difference in individuals’ [39]. People
differ in all sorts of ways which may not always be obvious or visible. These differences
might include race and ethnicity, culture and belief, gender and sexuality, age and social
status, ability and disability and use of health and social care services.’ [39] Awareness
of issues concerning diversity and inclusivity demonstrates to people and the wider re-
search team that the research being planned is to be conducted in an empowering and
anti-discriminatory way. Diversity and inclusion are key challenges INVOLVE has
highlighted in GEM that suggest that sometimes public involvement practice “…was
perceived as being exclusive and not always fully meeting the requirements and goals
of equality legislation.” [14] (p.39). Building inclusivity and diversity in to an ethically
conscious approach to research design stage public involvement could help ensure that
equality and anti-discriminatory practice is deeply rooted into the design of the re-
search and therefore benefiting health for all. We have aligned this principle with GEM
[14] replacing ‘diversity and inclusivity’ with ‘fairness of opportunity’ to better reflect
these over-arching ideals. The issue of who best to include would need to also consider
whether and when to include members of the public and/or those with lived experience
of the condition the researcher is focusing on (e.g. when ensuring the relevance of the
contents of a participant information sheet [40]). Consideration of matching the health
experiences of the public involved with those of the target study participants therefore
should be given, but in ways that do not disclose confidential or personal information
in a stigmatising manner [40].
Differentiating between public involvement and qualitative research methods
The blurring of boundaries between public involvement and qualitative research is doc-
umented as a methodological issue [41], but is not covered in any publications on eth-
ics we are aware of. The ethical issue we have observed: “Can I record and transcribe
the data from my focus group with patients” (Researcher) [the researcher was referring
to a public consultation meeting].
Pandya-Wood et al. Research Involvement and Engagement  (2017) 3:6 
Page 15 of 21
 Distinguishing between qualitative research methods and public involvement activ-
ities is often necessary at the research design stage. The use of terminology here is, we
believe, important. Consultation or discussion groups are often referred to using quali-
tative research terms such as ‘focus groups’ and the information collected sometimes
referred to as ‘data’. However, those involved at the research design stage are not re-
search participants and so in our view it is not helpful to refer to these activities using
such accepted research terminology. This ambiguity may be related to researchers
being unclear whether REC approval is required to involve the public at the research
design ethical stage (highlighted earlier). If data is collected and published this would
necessitate REC approval since it is research.
Some researchers advocate the explicit and deliberate combining of public in-
volvement activities with qualitative research methods [20]. As highlighted earlier,
we feel that this is misguided and can lead to considerable confusion and so is not
generally appropriate. Although there is no reason why those who are involved in
a study cannot also participate in some aspect of it the difference between the
roles and what is expected need to be made explicit. Researchers should also care-
fully consider whether this might present those involved with any potential con-
flicts of interest.
Participatory research is a valuable research method that starts with public in-
volvement and ends with the public becoming co-researchers collecting, analysing
and interpreting the data. However, there will, or at least should be, other public
involvement throughout a participatory research project. There cannot be participa-
tory research without involvement but it just adds to the widespread confusion to
deliberately confuse or even combine involvement (which is a way of working
between researcher and the public throughout a study from first concepts through
to implementation of the findings) with a specific method for data collection and
analysis.
The national network of RDSs can advise on the use of qualitative research methods
and consistent and appropriate terminology and practice for involving the public in the
research design stage.
Working sensitively
The axiom ‘do no harm’ is one of the fundamental principles of ethics [28], and is also
related to the notion of respect [34]. The ethical issue we have observed: “I need to find
two people who self-harm to sit on my public involvement group to help me plan the
public involvement bits of my study”. (Researcher).
Sometimes those involved at the research design stage may find the experience emo-
tionally burdening if it reminds them of previously undisclosed, negative aspects of
their (or someone they care for) health or experiences of care [42]. Researchers there-
fore need to involve the public sensitively especially with vulnerable people [43]. Care
should also be taken by researchers not to disclose sensitive information (e.g. risk fac-
tors or negative long term progress or even death associated with a condition) which
some people may not be aware of during early stage involvement. Sensitivity relating to
a person’s own health and the impact it may have on their ability to be involved is also
required [21].
Pandya-Wood et al. Research Involvement and Engagement  (2017) 3:6 
Page 16 of 21
 Being conscious of confidentiality
Research confidentiality and anonymity are well-established ethical principles [28, 34, 35]
concerned with researchers needing to be mindful of an individual’s privacy. The ethical
issue we have observed failed to take account of confidentiality: “The study is on X, [removed
the name of the sexually transmitted disease for confidentiality reasons] and Y [researcher
uses a real patient’s name] has offered to be involved as the patient” (Researcher).
Respecting the confidentiality of personal issues disclosed during research design
stage consultation groups requires fostering a confidential environment. Permissions
and confidentiality challenges may also need addressing if the public involvement con-
sultations are audio recorded and stored. In addition, if the public are involved in
undertaking protocol reviews prior to submission for funding this necessitates adher-
ence to a confidentiality agreement in the same way as for any other reviewers.
Valuing, acknowledging and rewarding public involvement
Researchers openly showing gratitude towards patients and the public in the research
design process is not grounded in ethical principles but we believe forms part of the
principles of respect [28, 34, 35] and integrity [34, 35] that will allow public contribu-
tors to contribute without undue personal burden, for example not being out of pocket
because of their involvement. The ethical issue we have observed: “It’s too expensive to
involve people [at the research design stage]. I am not going to do it and anyway I don’t
have the time”. (Researcher).
Researchers should be encouraged to highlight how involvement at the research de-
sign stage has been incorporated into their study. Valuing people as individuals with ex-
pertise to contribute [5] will lead to meaningful involvement and reduce the likelihood
of them feeling disempowered and marginalised [44]. There can be financial burdens
for those involved at the research design stage [45] and so it is important to also ac-
knowledge involvement through reward and recognition. Out of pocket expenses
should always be offered. Funding for research design stage public involvement is of-
fered by most RDSs [46]. Alerting researchers that such funds are available for public
involvement would be beneficial. However, some people may not accept payment, pre-
ferring other rewards (e.g. training opportunities). This is similar to the respect value in
the INVOLVE’s Values and Principles Framework [2], but again we recommend that it
is stressed and applied at an earlier stage. Individual feedback to those who have been
involved as well as communicating about the progress of the funding application are
also important ways to value them [5].
Conclusion
Reflections on ethical research design stage public involvement practice
We are not proposing a new statutory approval process for public involvement at the
research design stage, but envisage use of the proposed framework would be voluntary.
Hence it will only be useful if there is broad input in to its refinement and wide aware-
ness and adoption by the research community and the public. Discussions with peers
and the public suggest that ethical sensitivity for public involvement at the research
design stage is sometimes overlooked, indicating that this framework is very much
necessary [1].
Pandya-Wood et al. Research Involvement and Engagement  (2017) 3:6 
Page 17 of 21
 It should not be assumed that deliberately unethical practice in involving the
public at the research design stage is common, but in our experience, it is suffi-
ciently frequent to warrant us to propose the above framework to address poor
practices. Some researchers may be unaware of the potential ethical challenges that
can arise when involving the public at the research design stage. Alerting re-
searchers and the public to ethically conscious approaches to public involvement at
the research design stage would benefit their work and strengthen public involve-
ment generally. If research design stage public involvement activities are conducted
to consistent ethical standards by means of the proposed framework, then this
would also enable the research community to better assess the impacts of public
involvement on their research. This would enable the evidence base for the overall
impact of public involvement at all stages of the research journey to be broadened
and underpinned by an ethically strong foundation. In line with other recent calls,
we would suggest that these assessments move away from quantitative measure-
ment and consider context [4, 47].
The 10 ethical issues highlighted above form the basis of an ethically conscious
framework for all researchers embarking on research design stage public involvement
activities. These are summarised in Table 1.
Moving forward
Our framework may not currently be exhaustive and so we would welcome further in-
put from others, including the public, researchers, funders and policy groups. We rec-
ommend that a consultation or Delphi exercise (possibly utilising a Wiki governance
type model to help facilitative broad consultation [48]) is conducted on the above 10 is-
sues in our framework to explore whether there is consensus and whether there are
any additional issues to consider. Input from funders and groups such as the HRA and
INVOLVE would help with the framework’s dissemination and adoption. The public
can often offer unique insights in to ethical issues arising in research [3, 20]. It is there-
fore crucial to gain further input from the public on the proposed framework so that it
has wide relevance, application and adoption.
We believe that there is international transferability to this work; the concepts of re-
search design ethics we raise, we hope are a universal part of any democratic country
with research principles in health and social care. The next stage of this work will re-
quire input from international agencies across health, academia, industry and the
general global public to help join forces to fully understand research design stage ethics
involving the patients and the public. In connection to this, we understand limitations
to our work, in that we are advisers/researchers based in the UK, however to offer a
more rounded picture about the ethical issues we have raised, where possible we have
consulted international literature to strengthen and support case.
The scope of this paper was based on experience of advising on UK peer-reviewed
publicly funded competitions. However, we believe that the issues we raise are relevant
to commercial funding too. The next phase of this work will include consultation with
the healthcare industry.
In addition to the proposed Delphi consultation and to help shape the second stage
of this work we invite responses to our paper via email to: hra.epird@nhs.net.
