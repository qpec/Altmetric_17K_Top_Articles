ABSTRACT
p53 as an effector of nucleolar stress is well de-
fined, but p53 independent mechanisms are largely
unknown. Like p53, the NF-�B transcription factor
plays a critical role in maintaining cellular homeosta-
sis under stress. Many stresses that stimulate NF-�B
also disrupt nucleoli. However, the link between nu-
cleolar function and activation of the NF-�B pathway
is as yet unknown. Here we demonstrate that arti-
ficial disruption of the PolI complex stimulates NF-
�B signalling. Unlike p53 nucleolar stress response,
this effect does not appear to be linked to inhibition
of rDNA transcription. We show that specific stress
stimuli of NF-�B induce degradation of a critical com-
ponent of the PolI complex, TIF-IA. This degradation
precedes activation of NF-�B and is associated with
increased nucleolar size. It is mimicked by CDK4
inhibition and is dependent upon a novel pathway
involving UBF/p14ARF and S44 of the protein. We
show that blocking TIF-IA degradation blocks stress
effects on nucleolar size and NF-�B signalling. Fi-
nally, using ex vivo culture, we show a strong corre-
lation between degradation of TIF-IA and activation of
NF-�B in freshly resected, human colorectal tumours
exposed to the chemopreventative agent, aspirin. To-
gether, our study provides compelling evidence for a
new, TIF-IA–NF-�B nucleolar stress response path-
way that has in vivo relevance and therapeutic impli-
cations.
INTRODUCTION
The nucleolus is a highly dynamic, sub-nuclear organelle.
In addition to its primary function as the hub of ribosome
biogenesis, it acts as a critical stress sensor and coordinator
of stress response (12). The starting point of ribosome bio-
genesis is transcription of ribosomal DNA (rDNA), which
is mediated by the RNA polymerase I (PolI) complex. If cel-
lular homeostasis is challenged, a variety of kinases target
this complex and consequently, rDNA transcription is in-
hibited, the gross architecture of the nucleolus is altered, the
nucleolar proteome is dramatically modified and ultimately,
signals are transmitted to downstream effector pathways
so that cell growth and death are altered accordingly (1–
3). This chain of events is broadly termed ‘
nucleolar stress’
and the most recognised and characterised effector is the
MDM2-p53 axis (4–6). However, it is increasingly apparent
that nucleolar stress can regulate cell phenotype in a p53
independent manner (7–10). Indeed, the mechanisms that
coordinate stress effects on the PolI complex, and integrate
these into individual phenotypic outcomes, remain poorly
understood.
Similar to p53, the NF-�B transcription factor plays a
critical role in regulating cell growth and death in response
to stress (11). The most abundant form of NF-�B is a het-
erodimer of the p50 and RelA (p65) polypeptides which is
generally bound in the cytoplasm by the inhibitor, I�B� .
Upon exposure of the cell to a myriad of stresses, I�B� is de-
graded allowing NF-�B to translocate to the nucleus where
it regulates expression of target genes (12,13). In contrast
to the rapid activation observed in response to classical NF-
�B stimuli, stress stimuli (including serum starvation, UV-C
radiation and chemopreventative/therapeutic agents) gen-
erally induce the pathway with a much slower and delayed
kinetic (14). Although a number of mechanisms have been
proposed, how multiple environmental and cytotoxic stim-
uli induce the delayed activation of NF-�B remains unclear.
In this lab, we noted that a common response to stress
stimuli of the NF-�B pathway is modulation of nucleolar
architecture. In particular, an increase in the size of the or-
ganelle (14). This was of interest because a common de-
nominator of stresses that activate NF-�B is inhibition of
rDNA transcription (some of which are summarised in Sup-

plemental Table S1) (15–17). Furthermore, proteins that
have a role in stress-mediated activation of NF-�B reside
within this organelle (18–21). We have previously demon-
strated that post induction, RelA can accumulate in nucleoli
(14,22) and others have shown modulation of NF-�B sig-
nalling by ribosomal proteins (23,24). However, to the best
of our knowledge, no association between nucleolar stress
and induction of NF-�B signalling has previously been re-
ported.
Here, we investigated the relationship between stress ef-
fects on nucleoli and NF-�B signalling. We identify a novel
mechanism by which stresses act on nucleoli which involves
degradation of the PolI complex component, TIF-IA. We
show that increased nucleolar size and activation of the NF-
�B pathway are a direct downstream consequence of this
degradation. Furthermore, we show that this novel TIF-
IA–NF-�B nucleolar stress response pathway is triggered in
a whole tissue setting and has relevance to the anti-tumour
effects of aspirin.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and treatments
Human SW480, HRT18, RKO and HCT116 colon can-
cer cells, PNT pancreatic cells and Hela Cervical can-
cer cells, are available from the American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC). The p53 null derivative of HCT116
(HCT116p53-/−) was a gift from Professor B Vogelstein
(John Hopkins University School of Medicine, USA) and
has previously been described (25). HRT18SR, a deriva-
tive of HRT18 cells that constitutively expresses a non-
degradable I�B�, was generated in this lab and has been
described (26). All cell lines were maintained at 5% CO2
in growth medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal
calf serum (FCS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Medium
used was: SW480: Leibovitz’
s L-15: PNT, RKO, HCT116,
HCT116p53−/−-DMEM; HRT 18, HRT18SR-RPMI with
Geneticin (Gibco) selection.
All treatments were carried out in reduced serum
(0.5% FCS) medium for the times and concentrations
specified. Aspirin (Sigma) was prepared as previously
described
(26).
ActinomycinD
(Sigma),
Cyclohexam-
ide (Sigma), TNF (R&D Systems), Ceramide C2/C6
(Sigma),
Fumonisin
(VWR
International),
MG132
(Sigma), Lactacystin (Calbiochem), Quinacrine (Sigma),
Roscovitine (Cell Signalling Technology), BafilomycinA1
(Cambridge Bioscience) and Rapamycin (Sigma) were all
prepared as per manufacturer’
s instructions and used at
the concentrations given. For UV-C treatments, cells were
mock treated or exposed to UV-C under the conditions
stated.
The
CDK4
inhibitors
2-bromo-12,13-dihydro-
5H-indolo[2,3-a]pyrrolo[3,4-c]carbazole-5,7(6H)-dione
(CDK4i,
Calbiochem)
and
Palbociclib
(PD-0332991,
Selleckchem) were solubilised in DMSO and used as
indicated. The rDNA transcription inhibitor BMH-21
(12H-Benzo[g]pyrido[2,1-b]quinazoline-4-carboxamide,
N-[2(dimethylamino)ethyl]-12-oxo) was kindly supplied by
Prof. Marikki Laiho (Johns Hopkins University School
of Medicine, USA) and Nutlin-3 by Prof. Kathryn Ball
(University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh Cancer Research
Centre, UK).
Immunocytochemistry, image quantification and FUrd assays
Immunocytochemistry was performed as previously de-
scribed (22). Primary antibodies were TIF-IA (BioAs-
sayTech), Rrn3 (mouse), RelA (C-20), Nucelolin (MS-3),
RPA194 (all Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and Fibrillarin
(Cytoskeleton). Cells were mounted in Vectashield (Vec-
tor Laboratories) containing 1ug/ml DAPI. Images were
captured using a Coolsnap HQ CCD camera (Photomet-
rics Ltd, Tuscon, AZ, USA) Zeiss Axioplan II fluores-
cent microscope, 63 × Plan Neofluor objective, a 100 W Hg
source (Carl Zeiss, Welwyn Garden City, UK) and Chroma
83 000 triple band pass filter set (Chroma Technology, Bel-
lows Falls, UT, USA). Image capture was performed us-
ing scripts written for IPLab Spectrum 3.6 or iVision 3.6
in house. For each experiment, a constant exposure time
was used. Image quantification was carried out using DAPI
as a nuclear marker and fibrillarin as a nucleolar marker
along with ScanR (Olympus), IPLab or ImageJ image anal-
ysis software as specified in figure legends. Nuclear to cyto-
plasmic ratios of RelA were quantified by ImageJ measuring
signal intensity in a defined area of the nucleus (indicated by
DAPI) and an equal area at the sub-nuclear periphery (cy-
toplasm). At least 100 cells, from at least five random fields
of view, were quantified per experiment, for three indepen-
dent experiments or as specified in the text.
For fluorouridine (FUrd) run on assays, cells were treated
with 2 mM FUrd 15 min before harvest. Immunocyto-
chemistry was then performed with an anti-BrdU anti-
body (Sigma). Images were captured using a ScanR high-
content imager (Olympus) with a LUCPLFLN 40× objec-
tive (Olympus) and ScanR Acquisition software (Olympus).
FUrd incorporation was quantified for at least 1000 cells
per slide using ScanR analysis software with particle recog-
nition algorithms.

structs (3× enhancer �B ConA (3× �B ConA-Luc), I�B�
luciferase (I�B�-Luc)) and ��B-deleted derivatives (��B

Quantitative PCR
RNA was extracted from cells using RNeasy mini kit
(Qiagen) following the manufacturer’
s instructions. Ex-
tracted RNA was purified using RQ1 RNase-free DNase
(Promega) then cDNA generated using 1st Strand cDNA
synthesis kit (Roche). Taqman assays (Thermo Fisher Sci-
entific) and a LightCycler 480 system were used to quantify
transcript levels. The Comparative CT Method (or ��CT
Method) was used for calculation of relative gene expres-
sion.
Immunoblotting, luciferase reporter, cell cycle and apoptosis
assays
Immunoblotting, luciferase reporter and AnnexinV apop-
tosis assays were carried out as described previously (14,26).
Primary antibodies used for immunoblots are as fol-
lows: TIF-IA (rabbit, 1:2000, BioAssayTech B8433); Rrn3
(Mouse, 1:500, Santa Cruz sc-390464); RPA194 (POLR1A)
(H 300, Rabbit, Santa Cruz, sc-28714); RelAS536 (Rab-
bit, 1:500, Cell signalling, 3031S); GFP (Rabbit, 1:1000
Santa Cruz, sc-8433) UBF (Mouse, 1:500, Santa Cruz,
sc-13125); UBFS484 (Mouse. Assaybiotech, A8444); p53
(Mouse, 1:2000; Oncogene OP43); I�B (Sheep, 1:5000, gift
from RT Hay, University of Dundee). Cell cycle was anal-
ysed used FACs analysis of fixed, DAPI stained cells as pre-
viously described (28).
Immunoprecipitation
Immunoprecipitation assays were performed using Mag-
netic beads (Dynabeads®, Novex) and 1mg whole cell
lysate, prepared in NP40 lysis buffer. Mouse TIF-IA anti-
body (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used to immunopre-
cipitate the appropriate protein. Mouse IgG (pre-immune
serum) acted as a control. Complexes were resolved by SDS
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis then analysed by west-
ern blot analysis.
Phosphopeptide mapping
TIF-IA phosphorylation status was analysed by mass spec-
trometry as previously described (29). Briefly, SW480 cells
were treated with aspirin (0 or 10 mM, 2 h) then pelleted
cells disrupted in NP40 buffer and TIF-IA immunoprecipi-
tated as above. Tryptic peptides were generated by on bead
digestion and analysed on a Q-Exactive mass spectrome-
ter connected to an Ultimate Ultra3000 chromatography
system (both Thermo Scientific, Germany). Mass spectra
were analysed using the MaxQuant Software package in bi-
ological triplicate and technical replicate. The abundance of
phosphopeptides was determined as the ratio obtained by
dividing the intensity of phosphopeptides by the intensity
of the corresponding non-phosphorylated peptide.
Ex vivo treatment of tumour biopsies and immunohistochem-
istry
Biopsies of colorectal tumours were provided by a patholo-
gist at the time of resection. All patients were consented and
full ethical approval was in place (Scottish Colorectal Can-
cer Genetic Susceptibility Study 3; Reference: 11/SS/0109).
Biopsies were immediately transferred to the lab immersed
in culturing media (MEM supplemented with glutamine,
penicillin/streptomycin and anti-mycotic/antibiotic mix
(1:100, Sigma). Tumours were washed, dissected into 1–2
mM fragments then plated. Treatment (0–100 �M aspirin, 1
h, 37◦C) of tumour explants was performed in 96-well plates
in duplicate in the presence of 10% foetal calf serum (30).
Following treatment, tumours were either frozen for protein
analysis (set 1) or formalin fixed for immunohistochemistry
(set 2). Whole cell extracts were prepared using a TissueL-
yser (Qiagen) and standard whole cell lysis buffer.
Anti-p536RelA immunohistochemistry was carried out
using a DAB protocol on formalin fixed sections, as pre-
viously described (31). A Leica scanner digitised images
then Leica QWin plus image analysis software (Leica Mi-
crosystems Inc., Buffalo, IL, USA) used to analyse cells
for nuclear RelAp536 staining. Three distinct areas of tissue
and at least 1500 cells were analysed per section (average
4650). Scripts written in house determined the percentage of
cells showing negative, weak, moderate and strong RelAp536
staining.
Statistical analysis
P values throughout were calculated using a two-tailed Stu-
dent’
s t-test unpaired with equal variance. For immunocy-
tochemistry, the mean of at least five fields of view was de-
termined for each condition then P values generated using
the mean from at least three independent experiments (or as
specified in the figure legend). P values in Figure 8D were
derived using data from all cells analysed. For quantitative
PCR, P values were generated by comparing the mean of
three technical repeats, for three individual experiments, or
as specified in the figure legend. P values for reporter assays
represent the mean of at least 3 biological repeats. Pearsons
correlation coefficient (r2) was used to examine the relation-
ship between TIF-IA degradation and nuclear intensity of
RelA in patient samples.
RESULTS
Silencing of PolI complex components activates the NF-�B
pathway
To investigate the link between nucleolar perturbation and
NF-�B, we firstly inactivated an essential component of
the PolI pre-initiation complex, upstream binding factor
(UBF), then examined NF-�B pathway activity. This ap-
proach mimics that used by Rubbi and Milner to show nu-
cleolar stress stabilizes p53 (5). We found siRNA silencing
of UBF caused an increase in S536 phosphorylated RelA (a
marker for cytoplasmic activation of the NF-�B pathway), a
significant increase in nuclear RelA, and an increase in NF-
�B-driven transcription comparable to that observed when
cells were treated with the classic NF-�B stimulus, TNF
(Figure 1A). Degradation of I�B�, pRelAS536 phophory-
lation and increased NF-�B-driven transcription were also
observed upon silencing of the PolI components, POLR1A
(RPA194) and TIF-IA (Rrn3p) (Figure 1A and B). Im-
munoblot analysis confirmed that depleting TIF-IA, using

Figure 1. Silencing PolI complex components stimulates the NF-�B pathway. (A–C and E) SW480 cells were transfected with the indicated siRNA species.
(A) Cells were co-transfected with pCMV� and either a wild-type NF-�B-dependent luciferase reporter construct (3× �B ConA) or an equivalent plasmid
with �B sites deleted (ConA��B). TNF (10 ng/ml, 4 h) acts as a control NF-�B stimulant. Luciferase activity was normalized using �-galactosidase activity.
Results are presented as the percentage of relative NF-�B activity compared to cells transfected with 3× �B ConA-Luc/control siRNA (siControl). The
mean of at least 3 repeats (±s.e.m.) is shown. Inset: Levels of pRelA536, nuclear RelA and UBF in whole cell (WCL) or nuclear lysates were determined upon
UBF silencing using Western blot analysis. Actin acts as a control. (B) Immunoblots demonstrate- Left: reduced cytoplasmic I�B�, increased pRelAS536
and decreased cytoplasmic RelA upon silencing of TIF-IA and POLR1A. Nuclear extracts confirm efficient protein depletion. Right: increased nuclear
RelA upon depletion of TIF-IA by two independent siRNAs. �-Tubulin, fibrillarin and actin act as loading controls. (C) Cells were co-transfected with
I�B-luc (luciferase driven by full length I�B promoter) or ��B-I�B-luc (equivalent in which NF-�B sites are deleted) and pCMV�. The percentage
relative luciferase activity compared to siControl was calculated. Mean ± s.e.m. is shown (N = 3). (D) HCT116 cells were transfected as above. qRT-PCR
was performed with primers for the NF-�B target genes I�B� and Bcl-xl. GAPDH was used to normalise. Results are presented as the fold increase in
transcript compared to siControl. The mean (± s.e.m.) is shown. N = 3. (E) qRT-PCR with primers for the 47S pre-rRNA transcript measured levels of
rRNA transcription. GAPDH was used to normalise. Results are presented as the percentage of relative 47S transcription compared to siControl. The
mean (± s.e.m.) is shown. N > 3 (F) SW480 cells were treated with the PolI inhibitors CX5461 (500 nM), BMH-21 (4 uM), ActinomycinD (ActD, 1 ug/ml)
or TNF (10 ng/ml), for 5 h. qRT-PCR measured levels of the 47S transcript as above. Mean ± s.e.m. is shown (N = 2). (G) SW480 cells were transfected
with 3× �B ConA-Luc and pCMV�. Twenty-fours hours later they were treated with inhibitors as in F. Graph shows the mean of at least two individual
repeats ±s.e.m. P values throughout are compared to the respective control and were derived using a two tailed Student’
s t test. N values throughout are
biological repeats. In (C), the P value for siUBF I�B-Luc versus siUBF ��B-I�B-Luc is also given. See Supplemental Figure S1 for additional cell lines
and supporting data.

two independent siRNAs, induces nuclear accumulation of
RelA (Figure 1B).
A link between PolI complex disruption and increased
NF-�B activity was further confirmed using independent
cell lines (Supplemental Figure S1A and C) and an inde-
pendent reporter plasmid in which transcription of the lu-
ciferase gene is driven by the full-length promoter of the
classic NF-�B target, I�B� (Figure 1C). Indeed, depletion
of UBF caused a >5-fold increase in transcription from
the I�B� promotor. This effect was apparent, but signifi-
cantly reduced when an equivalent reporter plasmid lacking
�B sites was utilised (Figure 1C). These data suggest that
the effect of PolI complex disruption on I�B� transcription
is predominantly driven by NF-�B, although other factors
may play a role. qRT-PCR confirmed that silencing UBF or
TIF-IA induces transcription of I�B� and an independent
NF-�B target, Bcl-xl (Figure 1D and Supplemental Figure
S1B).
Given that disrupting nucleoli is linked with dramatic
changes in the nucleoplasmic proteome (3), we did con-
sider that silencing PolI complex components may stim-
ulate NF-�B-driven transcription in the absence of I�B
degradation/cytoplasmic release of NF-�B. However, the
significant increase in NF-�B-driven transcription observed
in control cells upon depletion of UBF and TIF-IA was
blocked in cells we generated to constitutively express su-
per repressor (non-degradable) I�B� (Supplemental Figure
S1C). Hence, we conclude that I�B� degradation is an es-
sential step for nucleolar stress to enhance NF-�B transcrip-
tional activity.
qRT-PCR for the 47S pre rRNA transcript confirmed
that siRNA to UBF, POLRIA and TIF-IA inhibited rDNA
transcription (Figure 1E and Supplemental Figure S1D).
Stabilization of p53 following nucleolar stress is strongly
linked to inhibition of rDNA transcription (6). Therefore,
we considered this may also be the case for activation of NF-
�B. However, actinomycinD and two highly specific small
molecule inhibitors of PolI (CX5461 and BHM-21 (32,33)
had no effect on NF-�B transcriptional activity, while caus-
ing a significant reduction in levels of the 47S transcript
(Figure 1F and G).
Taken together, these data suggest that it is not inhibition
of rRNA transcription per se, but a specific type of pertur-
bation of the PolI complex that activates the cytoplasmic
NF-�B pathway. To test this suggestion, we next examined
the effects of NF-�B stress stimuli on this complex.
Degradation of TIF-IA precedes NF-�B pathway activation
TIF-IA is essential for rDNA transcription as it tethers Pol
I to the rDNA promoter (34,35). It is also the component
of the complex that is targeted by stress/environmental sig-
nals to alter PolI activity (36,37). Therefore, we firstly inves-
tigated this protein. Aspirin was initially chosen as a model
stimulus as we are interested in the pro-apoptotic activity of
this agent and in the absence of additional cytokines, it stim-
ulates NF-�B in a manner characteristic of multiple stress
inducers (14,26).
Figure 2A demonstrates that aspirin not only induces
a decrease in Ser649 phosphorylated TIF-IA, which is a
known response to environmental stress, but also a signif-
icant decrease in native TIF-IA, which is not a reported
stress response (Figure 2A). This decrease in native TIF-IA
was observed by Western blot analysis (Figure 2A) and by
immunocytochemistry (Figure 2B). It was evident in mul-
tiple cell types, was independent of p53 status and most
importantly, was an early response to the agent, preceding
degradation of I�B and nuclear translocation of RelA (Fig-
ure 2C and D and Supplementary Figure S2A to C) (22,26).
qRT-PCR and cyclohexamide run on assays indicated
that the aspirin-induced reduction in TIF-IA was not a
consequence of reduced gene transcription, but caused by
increased protein turnover (Figure 2E and F and Supple-
mental Figure S2D). Neither proteasome nor lysosome in-
hibitors alone could block this increased turnover, which
was only abrogated when inhibitors of both pathways were
combined (Supplemental Figure S2E–H). Nutlin-3, the
MDM2 inhibitor known to block basal TIF-IA turnover,
actually enhanced aspirin-mediated TIF-IA degradation,
suggesting it takes place by an unreported mechanism (Sup-
plemental Figure S2E) (15). Exogenously expressed TIF-IA
was also rapidly degraded in response to aspirin (Supple-
mental Figure S2I). In contrast, the agent had no effect on
levels of UBF or POLR1A (Figure 2A).
Classic hallmarks of nucleolar stress are inhibition of
rDNA transcription, segregation of nucleolar marker pro-
teins and reduced nucleolar area (2). Given the role of
TIF-IA in maintaining nucleolar structure (38), we inves-
tigated these hallmarks. We found aspirin-mediated TIF-
IA degradation was associated with a significant decrease in
rDNA transcription, as indicated by 47S qRT-PCR and 5-
fluorouridine (FUrd) run on assays (Figure 2G and Supple-
mental Figure S3A). It was also associated with nucleolar
segregation, as evidenced by relocation of all three compo-
nents of the tri-partite nucleolar sub-structure to the periph-
ery of the organelle (Figure 2H and Supplemental Figure
S3B). However, in contrast to actinomycinD which caused a
significant reduction in nucleolar area, aspirin induced a sig-
nificant increase in nucleolar area (Figure 2H). This increase
was an early response to the agent, paralleling degradation
of TIF-IA and inhibition of rDNA transcription (Figure 2C
and I and Supplemental Figure S2C).
Generality of TIF-IA degradation in response to stress stimuli
of the NF-�B pathway
Having established aspirin has a unique effect on TIF-IA
and nucleolar structure, we next examined the generality of
this response with regards to stress stimuli of NF-�B. We
found that, like aspirin, UV-C induced a rapid depletion of
TIF-IA (Figure 3A–C). Although this depletion was tran-
sient in SW480 cells, it still preceded degradation of I�B
and was paralleled by enlargement of nucleoli (Figure 3A–
C). In contrast to UV-C, the DNA damaging agent camp-
tothecin, which has previously been shown to cause nucle-
olar stress (Supplemental Table S1), actually increased cel-
lular levels of TIF-IA (Figure 3D). It also had a minimal
effect on nucleolar structure (Figure 3D). Similarly, actino-
mycinD, BMH-21, CX5461 and TNF did not significantly
alter TIF-IA levels (Figure 3E).
Aspirin and UV-C generate ceramide, a crucial lipid sec-
ond messenger that is a potent stimulus of the NF-�B path-

way (39–41). When we tested the C2 and C6 soluble forms
of ceramide, which mimic the lipid increase observed in re-
sponse to stress, we found that they also induced degrada-
tion of TIF-IA (Figure 3F). Furthermore, this occurred in
association with increased nucleolar area, degradation of IB
and nucleolar translocation of RelA (Figure 3F). To further
explore the role of ceramide we utilised the ceramide syn-
thase inhibitor, FumonisinB1. Figure 3G and H demon-
strate that exposure to this inhibitor not only abrogates
aspirin-mediated degradation of TIF-IA, but also signifi-
cantly reduces nucleolar translocation of RelA.
Together, these data suggest that specific stresses target
TIF-IA for degradation through a novel, ceramide depen-
dent pathway, and that this degradation causes distinctive
changes in nucleolar structure and activation of NF-�B.
To explore this possibility, we set out to further elucidate
the mechanism underlying stress-mediated TIF-IA degra-
dation.
CDK4 inhibition mimics stress effects on TIF-IA and nucleoli
A common early response to aspirin, UV-C and ceramide
is reduced activity of the cyclin dependent kinase, CDK4
(42). Since CDK4 targets components of the PolI complex,
we considered that reduced activity of this kinase may play
an important upstream role. To test this possibility, we mim-
icked stress effects on CDK4 using a highly specific, small
molecule inhibitor (CDK4i), then monitored downstream
consequences on TIF-IA and nucleoli.
Immunoblot and immunocytochemical analysis revealed
that exposure of cells to CDK4i induced a substantial, dose
dependent reduction in TIF-IA protein levels (Figure 4A
and B). This reduction was evident in multiple cell types
(Figure 4A). It was also observed in response to an inde-
pendent CDK4 inhibitor, Palbociclib (PD0332991) (Sup-
plementary Figure S4A) and to siRNA depletion of the pro-
tein (Supplementary Figure S4B). Furthermore, it was par-
alleled by the same distinct nucleolar phenotype as stress
stimuli of the NF-�B pathway i.e increased nucleolar size,
segregation of nucleolar marker proteins and inhibition
of rDNA transcription (Figure 4C and D). Like aspirin,
CDK4i-mediated TIF-IA degradation was blocked by pro-
teasome and lysosomal inhibitors and enhanced in the pres-
ence of nutlin-3, suggesting it is mediated through the same
distinctive pathway (Supplementary Figure S4C and D). In
contrast to CDK4 inhibition, Roscovitine, which inhibits
CDK1, CDK2 and CDK5 (but not CDK4/6), had a mini-
mal effect on TIF-IA levels (Supplementary Figure S4E).
We did consider that stress effects on TIF-IA may
be linked to cell cycle, although this did seem unlikely
given that TIF-IA degradation was evident minutes after
aspirin/UV-C exposure (Figures 2A and 3A). Furthermore,
aspirin and Roscovitine arrest cells in the same phase of the
cell cycle (G2/M), but have opposing effects on TIF-IA,
while CDK4i inhibits cells in G1, but has the same effect
as aspirin (Supplemental Figure S4E and F). Therefore, we
concluded that TIF-IA degradation is not a consequence
of stress-mediated cell cycle arrest, but a specific response
to CDK4 inhibition.
Identification of a role for UBF S484 and p14ARF in TIF-IA
degradation
CDK4 regulates rDNA transcription by targeting UBF
(43). Therefore, we considered UBF may be required for
TIF-IA degradation downstream of CDK4 inhibition. In-
deed, siRNA silencing of UBF significantly abrogated
CDK4i-mediated TIF-IA degradation (Figure 4E and F).
Silencing of UBF also abrogated TIF-IA degradation in re-
sponse to the model stress inducer, aspirin (Figure 4E and
F). In contrast, silencing POLR1A did not perturb TIF-IA
degradation in response to either agent, suggesting speci-
ficity (Figure 4E).
CDK4 phosphorylates UBF on Serine 484 and so, we
next explored the role of this residue (43). Figure 4G
demonstrates that both aspirin and CDK4i cause a de-
crease in UBF S484 phosphorylation, in keeping with in-
hibition of the CDK4 kinase. To determine whether this
decrease is essential for TIF-IA degradation we utilised a
mutant that cannot be phosphorylated at this site (Flag-
UBF S484A). SW480 cells were depleted for UBF then
transfected with plasmids expressing either wild type pro-
tein (Flag-UBF-WT) or the Flag-UBF-S484A mutant. If
de-phosphorylation of UBF at S484 was important for TIF-
IA degradation, we would expect that the phospho-mutant
would mimic the effects of CDK4i on TIF-IA, or at least en-
hance CDK4i-mediated degradation of the protein. How-
ever, contrary to this expectation, expression of flag-UBF-
S484A actually blocked TIF-IA degradation in response to
CDK4i and aspirin (Figure 4H). Again, we found that si-
lencing of UBF abrogated CDK4i-mediated degradation of
TIF-IA, while expression of wild type UBF rescued this ef-
fect (Figure 4H). Together, these data indicate a crucial role
for UBF, and in particular residue 484, in stress-mediated
degradation of TIF-IA. However, the fact that the phospho-
mutant blocked TIF-IA degradation would suggest it is not
dephosphorylation at this site that is important.
p14ARF is a nucleolar tumour suppressor that regulates
rRNA synthesis in a manner dependent upon S484 of UBF
(44,45). It is also known to influence NF-�B signalling (46).
Therefore, we considered it may play a role. Indeed, im-
munoprecipitation assays revealed that TIF-IA complexes
with P14ARF in response to aspirin in a time and dose
dependent manner that parallels degradation of the pro-
tein (Figure 5A and Supplementary Figure S5A). Further-
more, immunoblot analysis indicated that siRNA silencing
of p14ARF blocks CDK4i and aspirin-mediated degrada-
tion of TIF-IA, while over-expression enhances this effect
(Figure 5B–D). Aspirin alone did appear to cause a dose de-
pendent reduction in p14ARF levels (Figure 5B). However,
detailed time course studies revealed that TIF-IA degrada-
tion precedes loss of p14ARF (Supplementary Figure S5B).
Immunocytochemical analysis confirmed that aspirin and
CDK4i cause a significant reduction in nuclear TIF-IA in
cells transfected with control siRNA, but not in cells trans-
fected with p14ARF siRNA (Figure 5E and F). Interest-
ingly, in the absence of p14ARF, TIF-IA remained within
nucleoli following aspirin and CDKi exposure suggesting
this protein may play a role in nucleolar export (Figure 5E
and F).

Figure 5. Identification of a role for p14ARF in TIF-IA degradation. (A) TIF-IA interacts with p14ARF in response to aspirin. SW480 cells were treated
with 0–5 mM aspirin for 16 h. Immunoprecipitation was carried out on WCL using antibodies to TIF-IA and IgG control. Precipitated proteins were
subjected to western blot analysis with the indicated antibodies. Input levels are shown. (B–F) Silencing of P14ARF is required for stress-mediated degra-
dation of TIF-IA. (B, C, E and F) SW480 cells were transfected with control or p14ARF siRNA (siARF) then treated for 16 h with CDK4i (0–1 �M) or
aspirin (0–3 mM). (B) Immunoblot analysis was performed on WCL with the indicated antibodies. (C) TIF-IA levels relative to actin were quantified using
ImageJ analysis. Graph shows the mean (±s.e.m.) compared to non-treated, siControl. N = 3. (E and F) Immunomicrographs (×63) show the levels and
localisation of TIF-IA in fixed cells. (E) IPlab software quantified nuclear (as depicted by DAPI staining) intensity of TIF-IA. Data are the mean (±s.e.m.)
of >150 nuclei. N = 3. Inset shows nucleolar (outlined) TIF-A in p14ARF transfected cells treated with aspirin. (D) SW480 cells were transfected with
pcDNA3 control plasmid (–) or pcDNA3-p14ARF (+) then either non-treated or treated with aspirin (3 mM, 16 h). Immmunoblot was performed on
WCL with the indicated antibodies. Actin acts as a loading control throughout. Scale bar = 10 �m. N values are biological repeats. P values were derived
using a two-tailed Student’

Together, these data provide very strong evidence for
a ceramide-CDK4-UBF/p14ARF stress response pathway
that lies upstream of TIF-IA degradation in response to
stress stimuli.
Identification of a link between TIF-IA degradation and ac-
tivation of the NF-�B pathway
Using p14ARF siRNA, we next questioned the role of
TIF-IA degradation in stress effects on the NF-�B path-
way and nucleolar structure. Figure 6A–C demonstrate that
blocking TIF-IA degradation in this manner significantly
abrogates aspirin-mediated inhibition of rDNA transcrip-
tion and enlargement of nucleoli. Furthermore, the sig-
nificant degradation of I�B and nuclear/nucleolar accu-
mulation of RelA observed in response to aspirin in con-
trol siRNA transfected cells was blocked in cells trans-
fected with siRNA to p14ARF (Figure 6B and D–F).
Aspirin-mediated apoptosis was also abolished by silencing
of p14ARF, which would be expected given our data show-
ing NF-�B pathway activation is required for the apop-
totic effects of the agent (26) (Figure 6G). Similar results
were obtained with CDK4i in that p14ARF silencing ab-
rogated CDK4i-mediated nucleolar enlargement, degrada-
tion of I�B and nuclear accumulation of RelA (Figure 7A
and B).
Next, we utilised the UBF-S484A mutant to investi-
gate the link between TIF-IA degradation and NF-�B
signalling. SW480 cells were transfected with control or
UBF siRNA prior to overexpression of Flag-UBF-WT or
-S484A. Quantitative immunocytochemistry was then used
to determine nuclear to cytoplasmic ratios of RelA. (Fig-
ures 7C and D). Figure 7D clearly demonstrates that the sig-
nificant increase in nuclear RelA observed in cells express-
ing Flag-UBF-WT is blocked in cells expressing Flag-UBF-
S484A (Figure 7C and D). Furthermore, it demonstrates
that CDK4i has a greater effect on the NF-�B pathway in
cells expressing the most UBF (control siRNA, Flag-UBF-
WT), which would be expected if UBF is essential. Together,
these data reveal a new pathway by which stresses act on the
PolI complex that involves CDK4-UBF(S484)/p14ARF fa-
cilitated degradation of TIF-IA. They also suggest atypical
changes in nucleolar architecture and activation of the NF-
�B pathway are downstream consequences of this specific
PolI complex disruption.
Dephosphorylation of S44 is critical for stress-mediated
degradation of TIF-IA and nuclear translocation of RelA
To provide further evidence for a direct relationship be-
tween TIF-IA degradation and activation of NF-�B,
we next used label-free quantitative mass spectrometry
(MaxLFQ), performed on immunoprecipitated endoge-
nous protein, to identify post-translational modifications
specifically altered by aspirin. Quantification of phosphory-
lation sites by LFQ revealed that serine 44 of TIF-IA is con-
sistently phosphorylated in control samples, and that this
phosphorylation is significantly reduced in response to the
agent (Figure 8A). To understand the significance of this de-
phosphorylation with respect to TIF-IA degradation, GFP-
TIF-IA mutants were generated in which S44 is mutated
to alanine (A) (which mimics de-phosphorylation) or as-
partic acid (D) (which mimics phosphorylation). Figure 8B
demonstrates that, compared to wild type protein, GFP-
TIF-IA S44A shows enhanced degradation in response to
aspirin while degradation of GFP-TIF-IA S44D is abro-
gated. Exposure to the phosphatase inhibitor, calyculinA,
also blocked aspirin and CDK4i-mediated TIF-IA degra-
dation (Figure 9C). These data confirm a critical role for
S44 dephosphorylation in TIF-IA degradation, and suggest
that protein phosphatases are critical in this process.
Next we used the TIF-IA S44 mutants to determine
whether modulating TIF-IA degradation alters stress ef-
fects on the NF-�B pathway. SW480 cells were transfected
with GFP-TIF-IA-WT, -S44A or -S44D, then quantitative
immunocytochemistry used to analyse aspirin-mediated
nuclear/nucleolar translocation of RelA. As aspirin induces
degradation of GFP-TIF-IA prior to effects on NF-�B sig-
nalling, we could not do this analysis on transfected cells
only. Therefore, we quantified the whole cell population.
These data revealed that nuclear/nucleolar translocation
of RelA was significantly enhanced in populations trans-
fected with GFP-TIF-IA S44A, and significantly abrogated
in those transfected with TIF-IA S44D (Figure 8D). The
number of transfected cells prior to treatment, and the lev-
els of expressed protein, were similar for all constructs, sug-
gesting this difference was not a consequence of differential
transfection efficiency (Figure 8B).
At this time, we cannot establish a link between
UBF/p14ARF and dephosphorylation of TIF-IA at S44.
Nonetheless, these studies reveal a critical role for TIF-IA
S44 in the degradative response to stress and importantly,
provide direct evidence for a link between TIF-IA degrada-
tion and activation of the NF-�B pathway.
Relationship between TIF-IA degradation and stimulation of
NF-�B signalling in human clinical samples
Overwhelming evidence indicates that aspirin has anti-
tumour activity and the potential to prevent colorectal and
other cancers (47,48). To investigate the clinical significance
of our results with regards to this activity, and to determine
whether there is a link between PolI complex disruption
and NF-�B pathway activation in a whole tissue setting, we
treated biopsies of fresh, surgically resected human colorec-
tal tumours with pharmacological doses (0–100 �M, 1 h)
of aspirin ex vivo (Figure 9A). This aspirin concentration is
comparable to salicylate levels we measured in plasma from
patients given a short course of analgesic doses of aspirin
(26). It is also well within the reported therapeutic range
(0.1–3 mM).
Western blot analysis revealed low dose aspirin induces
TIF-IA degradation (as defined by a >2-fold reduction in
protein levels) in 4/7 (57%) tumours exposed ex vivo to the
agent (Figure. 9B). Furthermore, quantitative immunohis-
tochemistry with antibodies to pRelA536 indicated ex vivo
exposure to low dose aspirin induced NF-�B pathway ac-
tivation in 3/6 tumours (Figure 7C). Importantly, for indi-
vidual tumours, there was a very strong inverse correlation
(r2 = –0.85, n = 6) between aspirin effects on TIF-IA and
RelA536 phosphorylation (Figure 9D). That is, the greater
the loss of TIF-IA, the greater the increase in NF-�B path-

Figure 9. TIF-IA degradation correlates with NF-�B pathway activation in human clinical samples. (A) Diagram depicting workflow of ex vivo culture.
Resected colorectal tumour biopsies were immediately transferred to the lab, washed, immersed in culturing media in 96-well plates then exposed to 0 or
100 uM aspirin for 1 h. One piece of tissue was fixed for immunohistochemistry while another was frozen for protein analysis. This was carried out for
seven patients. (B) Immunoblot was performed on WCL with the indicated antibodies. (C) ImageJ quantified TIF-IA intensity relative to actin. * Tumours
showing a >2-fold decrease in relative levels of TIF-IA in response to aspirin were deemed to respond. (D and E) Immunohistochemistry was performed on
sections from paraffin embedded tissue with antibodies to RelAp536. (D) An example immunomicrograph. Arrows indicate epithelial cells. (E) Leica QWin
plus image analysis software, with scripts written in house, was used to quantify the nuclear RelAp536 intensity in digitized images. Three distinct areas of
tissue and at least 1500 cells were analysed per section. Data presented are the % cells showing moderate+strong RelAp536 staining, as indicated by image
analysis software. * Significant (P < 0.05) difference between the % stained cells in treated and non-treated sections. (F) Graph showing the relationship
between aspirin-induced changes in TIF-IA and RelAp536 staining for six individual tumours. Pearsons correlation coefficient (r2) was used to examine
the relationship. (G) Proposed model. Generation of ceramide by specific stresses inhibits CDK4 kinase activity, which induces degradation of TIF-IA
in a manner dependent on UBF/p14ARF. The consequent disruption of the PolI pre-initiation complex causes distinct changes in nucleolar architecture
and triggers a protein or pathway (as yet unknown) which causes phosphorylation and degradation of I�B�, nuclear translocation of RelA and ultimately,
transcription of a gene programme that alters cell phenotype. We propose the nature of this transcriptional program is cell type and stimulus dependent.

way activation. These data confirm that aspirin causes PolI
complex disruption and activates the NF-�B pathway in
primary human tumours and suggests a strong relationship
between these two events in a whole tissue setting. These
data have far reaching implications for understanding of the
anti-tumour effects of this agent.
DISCUSSION
The work presented here has great significance as we iden-
tify a novel mechanism by which PolI activity is inhibited by
stress, and reveal NF-�B activation as a novel downstream
consequence of nucleolar stress response (Figure 9G). We
demonstrate the relevance of this pathway in vivo using hu-
man clinical samples and show it may contribute to the anti-
tumour effects of aspirin. These data shed new light on the
mechanisms by which nucleoli sense stress and coordinate
the downstream consequences.
Identification of an TIF-IA–NF-�B nucleolar stress response
pathway
The paradigm of nucleolar stress response is inhibition
of rDNA transcription leading to stabilisation of p53 (6).
Here, we provide powerful evidence for an independent
nucleolar stress response pathway that is characterised by
degradation of TIF-IA leading to activation of NF-�B.
Firstly, we demonstrate that specifically disrupting the PolI
complex activates the cytoplasmic NF-�B pathway, but that
this effect is not mimicked by potent inhibitors of rDNA
transcription. Secondly, we show that TIF-IA degrada-
tion precedes NF-�B pathway activation in response spe-
cific stimuli. Thirdly, using three independent approaches
(siRNA depletion of P14ARF, expression of mutant UBF
and expression of mutant TIF-IA), we demonstrate that
blocking TIF-IA degradation blocks stress effects on the
NF-�B pathway. Finally, we demonstrate a strong correla-
tion between loss of TIF-IA and activation of NF-�B in a
whole tissue setting. We are currently exploring the mech-
anisms by which TIF-IA degradation induces NF-�B sig-
nalling. Based on the p53 model, we suggest that an NF-�B
activating factor(s) is released from nucleoli upon PolI com-
plex disruption. CK2 is an excellent candidate factor as it is
found as part of the PolI complex (18) and phosphorylates
I�B� in response to UV-C (19). Another kinase of interest
is NIK (NF-�B inducing kinase), which acts upstream of
the IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex and is known to shut-
tle through nucleoli (49). The ribosomal proteins L3 and S3
have also been shown to complex with I�B and modulate
NF-�B activity (24,49–50). We presume that the p53 regu-
latory proteins RPL11 and 5 are not involved as they are
released from nucleoli in response to CX5461 and BMH21,
which we found have no effect on NF-�B signalling.
In support of our notion that the TIF-IA–NF-�B nucleo-
lar stress response pathway is distinct from classical nucleo-
lar stress, we found that it is associated with a distinct nucle-
olar phenotype. That is, inhibition of rDNA transcription
alongside increased nucleolar size. This phenotype would
appear to contradict the belief, used widely by pathologists,
that increased nucleolar size is a marker for enhanced rRNA
transcription. In keeping with our findings, Fatyol et al.
found that MG132 induces a significant increase in nucle-
olar volume while inhibiting rRNA transcription and me-
diating cell death (51). Similarly, Bailly et al found that the
NEDD8 inhibitor, MLN4924, causes an increase in nucleo-
lar size while inducing cell death, although in this case there
was no effect on rRNA transcription (52). More recently,
Buchwalter et al (53) and Tiku et al. (54) reported an as-
sociation between increased nucleolar size and premature
aging. This is extremely interesting given the role of NF-�B
activity in aging disorders (55). Understanding how TIF-IA
degradation alters nucleolar size, and the role this plays in
NF-�B signalling, is now a priority.
Since NF-�B stress stimuli inhibit rRNA transcription, it
is highly likely that they also stabilize p53. We have previ-
ously demonstrated that stimulation of the NF-�B pathway
is absolutely necessary for aspirin-mediated apoptosis, but
that p53 is dispensable (26,56). Here we show that blocking
TIF-IA degradation blocks aspirin-mediated stimulation of
the NF-�B pathway and apoptosis. Therefore, we believe
that in this context, the phenotypic response to nucleolar
stress is governed by the NF-�B pathway.
Identification of a novel pathway to TIF-IA inactivation
It is well documented that the phosphorylation status of
TIF-IA is modulated in response to environmental and
cytotoxic stress so that rates of rRNA transcription can
be adjusted accordingly (34). Here we identify an alterna-
tive mechanism by which stress can act on the PolI com-
plex involving degradation of TIF-IA. We also present sev-
eral lines of evidence to suggest that this degradation lies
downstream of CDK4 inhibition and UBF/p14ARF (Fig-
ure 9G). We demonstrate that stress effects on TIF-IA can
be mimicked by two highly specific CDK4 inhibitors and by
CDK4 depletion. We also demonstrate silencing of UBF or
p14ARF blocks aspirin and CDK4i-mediated degradation
of TIF-IA, while overexpression of either of these proteins
enhances this effect. Furthermore, we show that expres-
sion of mutant UBF (S484A) blocks aspirin and CDK4i-
mediated TIF-IA degradation. Although these studies were
focussed on CDK4, the small molecule inhibitors we used
to block CDK4 also block CDK6 activity and so, we cannot
rule out a possible role for this kinase.
In addition to CDK4-p14ARF/UBF, we identified a
role for serine (S)44 of TIF-IA, and in particular, de-
phosphorylation at this site. Mayer et al have previously
shown that S44 of TIF-IA is dephosphorylated by protein
phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and that MTOR inhibition plays
a role in this process (37). Here show that the PP2A in-
hibitor, CalyculinA, blocks aspirin and CDK4i-mediated
TIF-IA degradation, consistent with a role for this phos-
phatase. However, we found that the specific MTOR in-
hibitor, rapamycin, has a minimal effect on basal TIF-IA
levels and no effect on aspirin-mediated degradation of the
protein (Supplemental Figure S5C). These data would sug-
gest that an alternative, PP2A dependent pathway may be
involved. Defining the nature of this pathway, and how
it combines with CDK4 inhibition-UBF/p14ARF to pro-
mote TIF-IA degradation, is out-with the scope of the cur-
rent study. However, future understanding of this pathway

is critical as it may reveal novel targets to modulate TIF-IA
levels and hence, NF-�B activity and rRNA transcription.
Aspirin degradation of TIF-IA:Identification of a novel mech-
anism of action
Despite the burden of evidence indicating aspirin use can
prevent colorectal cancer, the agent cannot be recom-
mended for this purpose due to its significant side effect pro-
file. Hence, efforts are now focussed on understanding the
mechanism by which aspirin acts against colorectal cancer
cells to identify markers of response and targets for safer,
more effective alternatives. Uncontrolled rDNA transcrip-
tion is a hallmark of colorectal and other cancers and con-
tributes to tumour growth by allowing de-regulated pro-
tein synthesis and uncontrolled activity of nucleolar cell
growth/death pathways (33,57). Here we show for the first
time that aspirin inhibits rDNA transcription in colorectal
cancer. We show this in multiple colorectal cancer cell lines
and demonstrate the agent induces TIF-IA degradation in
a whole tumour setting. These data represent an extremely
exciting, novel mechanism of action that could have a sig-
nificant impact in defining patients that would benefit from
aspirin therapy.
We show aspirin activates the NF-�B pathway both in
vitro, and in a whole tissue setting. While this agent is gener-
ally thought to be an inhibitor of NF-�B activity, its effects
are context dependent. That is, short pre-exposure inhibits
cytokine-mediated activation of NF-�B while prolonged ex-
posure to the agent alone (representing chemoprevention)
activates NF-�B signalling (58,26). These data would sug-
gest that the pathway by which NF-�B is activated in re-
sponse to nucleolar stress differs from that utilised by in-
flammatory cytokines, although this remains to be con-
firmed.
In summary, the data presented here open up new av-
enues of research into nucleolar regulation of NF-�B sig-
nalling and regulation of TIF-IA stability under stress. They
also shed further light on the complex mode of action of
aspirin and related non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs).
