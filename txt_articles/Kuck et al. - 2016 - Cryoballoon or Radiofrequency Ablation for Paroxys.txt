BACKGROUND
Current guidelines recommend pulmonary-vein isolation by means of catheter 
ablation as treatment for drug-refractory paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Radiofre-
quency ablation is the most common method, and cryoballoon ablation is the 
second most frequently used technology.
METHODS
We conducted a multicenter, randomized trial to determine whether cryoballoon 
ablation was noninferior to radiofrequency ablation in symptomatic patients with 
drug-refractory paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. The primary efficacy end point in a 
time-to-event analysis was the first documented clinical failure (recurrence of 
atrial fibrillation, occurrence of atrial flutter or atrial tachycardia, use of antiar-
rhythmic drugs, or repeat ablation) following a 90-day period after the index abla-
tion. The noninferiority margin was prespecified as a hazard ratio of 1.43. The 
primary safety end point was a composite of death, cerebrovascular events, or 
serious treatment-related adverse events.
RESULTS
A total of 762 patients underwent randomization (378 assigned to cryoballoon 
ablation and 384 assigned to radiofrequency ablation). The mean duration of fol-
low-up was 1.5 years. The primary efficacy end point occurred in 138 patients in 
the cryoballoon group and in 143 in the radiofrequency group (1-year Kaplan–
Meier event rate estimates, 34.6% and 35.9%, respectively; hazard ratio, 0.96; 95% 
confidence interval [CI], 0.76 to 1.22; P<0.001 for noninferiority). The primary 
safety end point occurred in 40 patients in the cryoballoon group and in 51 pa-
tients in the radiofrequency group (1-year Kaplan–Meier event rate estimates, 
10.2% and 12.8%, respectively; hazard ratio, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.52 to 1.18; P 
= 
0.24).
CONCLUSIONS
In this randomized trial, cryoballoon ablation was noninferior to radiofrequency 
ablation with respect to efficacy for the treatment of patients with drug-refractory 
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and there was no significant difference between the 
two methods with regard to overall safety. (Funded by Medtronic; FIRE AND ICE

A
ccording to a 2012 expert consen-
sus statement, catheter ablation of drug-
refractory paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is 
a class I level A indication,1 and pulmonary-vein 
isolation is the standard approach.1-3 The two 
most frequently used ablation technologies for 
pulmonary-vein isolation differ in the energy 
source and mode of application. The most com-
mon method is the use of radiofrequency current 
applied in a point-by-point mode, which leads to 
cellular necrosis by tissue heating; the other 
method is the use of cryogenic energy applied 
with a balloon in a single-step mode, which 
leads to necrosis by freezing (Fig. 1). Radiofre-
quency ablation for atrial fibrillation requires 
only limited use of fluoroscopy, because catheter 
guidance is achieved with the use of an electro-
anatomical mapping system,1,4 but the approach 
demands extensive training.1 The complexity of 
radiofrequency ablation technology has restrict-
ed ablation therapy for atrial fibrillation to a few 
specialized centers and has limited the availabil-
ity of ablation therapy. Cryoablation for atrial 
fibrillation requires more extensive fluoroscopic 
guidance to position the balloon catheter at the 
pulmonary veins. The cryoballoon was developed 
to create a circular lesion around each pulmonary 
vein in a relatively simple manner.
Some small studies have compared the two 
types of ablation catheters.5-10 The current study 
was designed to compare the performance of the 
rather complex yet well-established approach of 
radiofrequency ablation with that of the appar-
ently simpler approach of cryoballoon ablation in 
a larger population of patients with paroxysmal 
atrial fibrillation.
Methods
Trial Design
The FIRE AND ICE trial was a multicenter, ran-
domized, noninferiority, parallel-group, open-label 
trial, with blinded end-point assessment, in which 
cryoballoon ablation was compared with radiofre-
quency ablation. The trial was investigator-initi-
ated; the steering committee was responsible for 
design, execution, and conduct of the study (see 
the Supplementary Appendix, available with the 
full text of this article at NEJM.org). Local ethics 
review committees at each center approved the 
study. A data and safety monitoring board re-
viewed interim results and monitored the safety 
of the patients. An end-point review committee, 
the members of which were unaware of the treat-
ment-group assignments, adjudicated primary 
safety and efficacy events. All members of the 
steering committee approved the statistical analy-
ses and interpretation of the data. The decision to 
publish the results and decisions regarding the 
contents of the manuscript were made by the 
steering committee. The authors attest to the ac-
curacy of the data and of all analyses and to the 
fidelity of this report to the trial protocol, which 
is available at NEJM.org.
The trial was funded by Medtronic, with trial 
oversight by FGK Representative Service as legal 
sponsor. A contract research organization (the 
Institute for Clinical Cardiovascular Research, 
Munich, Germany) collected, monitored, main-
tained, and analyzed the data. During the trial, 
the contract research organization became insol-
vent. Legal sponsorship and trial oversight was 
transferred to Medtronic for completion of the 
trial, and a second contract research organization 
(Genae, Antwerp, Belgium) was hired. Data trans-
fer between the two contract research organiza-
tions occurred without the sponsor handling the 
data, and blinding with regard to the treatment-
group assignments was preserved.
Study Participants
Sixteen centers in eight countries participated in 
the trial (see the Supplementary Appendix for the 
list of investigators). Patients with symptomatic 
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation that was refractory 
to class I or class III antiarrhythmic drugs or beta 
blockers were enrolled. Patient eligibility was de-
termined according to the inclusion and exclu-
sion criteria listed in Tables S1 and S2 in the 
Supplementary Appendix.4 All participants gave 
written informed consent. After enrollment, pa-
tients were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to 
undergo ablation with pulmonary-vein isolation 
attempted with the use of a cryoballoon (cryobal-
loon group) or by means of radiofrequency cur-
rent (radiofrequency group). Randomization was 
stratified according to center and age (≤65 vs. 
>65 years).
Interventions
The ablation methods are described in the Sup-
plementary Appendix. In brief, in the cryoballoon 
group, operators attempted pulmonary-vein iso-
lation by placing the device (with fluoroscopic 
guidance) at each pulmonary-vein antrum, ad-
vancing it toward the pulmonary vein to achieve

occlusion, and then cooling the tissue by filling 
the balloon with a liquid refrigerant. In the 
radiofrequency group, operators attempted pul-
monary-vein isolation by creating a contiguous 
circular lesion around each pulmonary-vein an-
trum with point-by-point applications of radio-
frequency energy, using electroanatomical nav-
igation (Fig. 1).

Study Follow-up
After the index ablation procedure, in-office visits 
were scheduled at 3, 6, and 12 months and every 
6 months thereafter (Fig. S1 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix). At each visit, a medical history 
was obtained, a physical examination was per-
formed, and a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) 
and a 24-hour Holter monitor recording were 
obtained. A review of arrhythmia symptoms was 
conducted by telephone interview at 9 months 
and every 6 months thereafter. Patients were 
asked to provide a weekly transtelephonic ECG 
recording during the study and to transmit 
ECGs whenever symptoms of arrhythmia were 
felt. All follow-up assessments were performed 
by study personnel who were unaware of the 
treatment assignments.
End Points
The primary hypothesis was that catheter abla-
tion with the use of the cryoballoon would be 
noninferior to radiofrequency ablation with re-
spect to a prespecified efficacy criterion. This 
primary efficacy end point in a time-to-event 
analysis was the first documented clinical fail-
ure occurring more than 90 days after the index 
ablation procedure. Clinical failure was defined 
as documented recurrence of atrial fibrillation 
(lasting more than 30 seconds), documented oc-
currence of atrial flutter or atrial tachycardia, 
prescription of antiarrhythmic drugs (class I or 
III), or repeat ablation.
Recurrences of atrial fibrillation during the 
first 90 days after the index ablation (the so-
called “blanking period”) were not counted in 
the determination of the first clinical failure for 
the primary end point. Early recurrence of atrial 
fibrillation after ablation, resulting from inflam-
mation or incomplete lesion healing, is common 
and may not predict long-term outcome.1 Within 
the blanking period, recurrent arrhythmias could 
be managed with antiarrhythmic drugs (exclud-
ing amiodarone), cardioversion, or repeat abla-
tion (with the same randomly assigned catheter 
type) without penalty with regard to the primary 
efficacy end point.
The prespecified secondary end points report-
ed in this article include death from any cause, 
death from arrhythmia, total duration of the pro-
cedure, total fluoroscopy time, and first rehospital-
ization for cardiovascular causes. Additional pre-
specified secondary end points (for which results 
are not shown in this article) included the total 
number of hospitalizations for cardiovascular 
causes, time-to-event analyses of the components 
of the primary end point, time to recurrent atrial 
fibrillation, time to symptomatic atrial fibrilla-
tion, and quality of life.
The primary safety end point was a composite 
of death from any cause, stroke or transient is 
che-
mic attack from any cause, and serious adverse 
events. Serious adverse events included cardiac 
arrhythmias (apart from a recurrence of atrial 
fibrillation) that were causally related to the thera-
peutic intervention and procedure-related serious 
adverse events that were judged by the end-point 
review committee to be causally related to the 
treatment. All serious adverse events were pre-
specified. Physicians were required to report all 
adverse events.
Statistical Analysis
Assuming event-free 1-year survival rates of 70% 
in both groups and with a noninferiority margin 
of 10% (corresponding to a hazard ratio of 1.43), 
we calculated that 249 primary-end-point events 
would be required for the trial to have 80% 
power to test the noninferiority of cryoballoon 
ablation to radiofrequency ablation, at a one-sided 
alpha level of 0.025. A sample size of 549 patients 
was originally estimated. A prespecified blinded 
sample-size reestimation was performed before 
enrollment was fully complete. On the basis of 
the reestimation, we calculated that 768 patients 
would have to be enrolled to ensure that 249 
primary-end-point events would be observed.
Two prespecified interim analyses and a final 
analysis were performed when 125, 187, and 249 
primary-end-point events, respectively, had been 
observed. During the study, no early-stopping 
boundaries were met. Two analysis cohorts were 
prespecified (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix). The modified intention-to-treat cohort 
included all patients who underwent randomiza-
tion and their randomly assigned catheter abla-
tion procedure. The per-protocol cohort consisted 
of patients who were treated and did not have a 
major protocol deviation. A major protocol devia-
tion was defined as a deviation that confounded 
the efficacy end point; such deviations included 
amiodarone use, undergoing an ablation with a 
non–study-specified catheter, and undergoing an 
ablation with a catheter that was not in accordance 
with the randomly assigned treatment group.

Cryoballoon or Radiofrequency Ablation
The primary efficacy end point was evaluated 
with the use of a noninferiority log-rank test.11 
In addition, a noninferiority test based on a Cox 
proportional-hazards model was performed. The 
corresponding hazard ratio and 95% confidence 
interval were estimated with a Cox proportional-
hazards model, after confirmation of the pro-
portional-hazards assumption. If noninferiority 
was met in both the modified intention-to-treat 
cohort and the per-protocol cohort, then superi-
ority could be tested in the modified intention-
to-treat cohort with the use of a log-rank test. Cox 
proportional-hazards regression was used to esti-
mate hazard ratios in the primary analysis, 
subgroup analyses, and primary safety analysis. 
The Kaplan–Meier method was used to calculate 
12-month event-rate estimates. For each subgroup 
analysis, a Wald test for interaction was per-
formed. Four separate types of catheter were used 
during the study: the first-generation and second-
generation cryoballoon catheters, the combined 
first-generation radiofrequency catheters (there 
were two types; see the Methods section in the 
Supplementary Appendix), and the advanced-gen-
eration radiofrequency catheter. A log-rank test 
was used to analyze the primary efficacy end 
point according to catheter type.
Because of the blanking period defined above, 
90 days was selected as the landmark (starting 
time) of time-to-event analyses for the primary 
efficacy end point. Analyses were conducted with 
SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute), and the 
R statistical package, version 3.2.2 (www.r-project 
.org). Mean values are presented with standard 
deviations.
Results
Patients
Enrollment of patients started on January 19, 
2012, and was completed on January 27, 2015. A 
total of 769 patients were enrolled (Fig. S2 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). The modified inten-
tion-to-treat population included the 750 patients 
who were randomly assigned to a treatment group 
(376 in the radiofrequency group and 374 in the 
cryoballoon group) and received treatment. Of 
those patients, 352 in the radiofrequency group 
and 341 in the cryoballoon group did not have a 
major protocol violation reported; these patients 
comprised the per-protocol cohort. The charac-
teristics of the patients at baseline were balanced 
between the two groups, with the exception of 
the prevalence of chronic kidney disease and dia-
betes (Table 1). During the procedure, complete 
isolation was achieved in 97.9% of pulmonary 
veins in the radiofrequency group and in 98.9% of 
pulmonary veins in the cryoballoon group.
A total of 85% of the scheduled follow-up 
visits in the radiofrequency group (2007 of a 
total of 2372 visits) and 87% of the scheduled 
follow-up visits in the cryoballoon group (2006 
of 2317 visits) were attended (Table S3 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). Patients transmitted 
transtelephonic ECGs for a mean of 60% of the 
weeks in which they were followed in the radio-
frequency group and for 58% of the weeks in 
which they were followed in the cryoballoon 
group. In the radiofrequency group, 4 patients 
were lost to follow-up, and 32 patients withdrew 
from the trial or were withdrawn by the investi-
gator; in the cryoballoon group, 5 patients were 
lost to follow-up, and 37 patients withdrew from 
the trial or were withdrawn by the investigator. 
In both groups, the maximum follow-up time 
was 33 months, and the mean follow-up time was 
1.5 years.
Efficacy End Points
The number of end-point events required to test 
the primary efficacy hypothesis was achieved on 
September 17, 2015, and data freeze occurred on 
January 29, 2016. In the modified intention-to-
treat analysis, after the 90-day blanking period, 
the primary efficacy end point occurred in 138 
patients in the cryoballoon group and in 143 
patients in the radiofrequency group (1-year Ka-
plan–Meier event-rate estimates, 34.6% and 35.9%, 
respectively; hazard ratio, 0.96; 95% confidence 
interval [CI], 0.76 to 1.22; P<0.001 for noninferi-
ority) (Table 2 and Fig. 2A). In the per-protocol 
analysis, the primary efficacy end point oc-
curred in 118 patients in the cryoballoon group 
and in 131 patients in the radiofrequency group 
(1-year Kaplan–Meier event-rate estimates, 31.9% 
and 35.0%, respectively; hazard ratio, 0.91; 95% 
CI, 0.71 to 1.17; P<0.001 for noninferiority). A 
prespecified superiority test performed for the 
primary efficacy end point did not indicate a 
significant difference between the treatment 
groups (P 
= 
0.74). Prespecified subgroup analy-
ses of the primary efficacy end point revealed no 
significant interactions (Fig. S3 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). A prespecified comparison

Cryoballoon or Radiofrequency Ablation
of the primary efficacy end point among the 
four separate types of catheters revealed no sig-
nificant heterogeneity (P 
= 
0.25) (Fig. 2B).
Results regarding the secondary efficacy end 
points are shown in Table 2. There were two 
deaths in the cryoballoon group; one death (at 
day 366) was of unknown cause, and the other 
death (at day 95) was associated with sepsis and 
was determined by autopsy to be a noncardiac-
related death. The mean total procedure time 
was shorter in the cryoballoon group than in the 
radiofrequency group (124 vs. 141 minutes, 
P<0.001), as was the left atrial dwell time (the 
length of time the catheter was present in the 
left atrium during the procedure), which was a 
post hoc end point (92 vs. 109 minutes, P<0.001). 
The mean total fluoroscopy time was shorter in 
the radiofrequency group than in the cryobal-
loon group (17 vs. 22 minutes, P<0.001). The 
time to first rehospitalization for cardiovascular 
causes did not differ significantly between the 
groups.
Safety End Points
The primary safety end point occurred in 40 pa-

Discussion
The FIRE AND ICE trial was a randomized evalu-
ation of catheter ablation in patients with parox-
ysmal atrial fibrillation, in which we examined 
the efficacy, safety, and procedural profiles of 
the two most commonly used ablation technolo-
gies. The characteristics of the patients were 
consistent with those in other trials5-10,12,13 and are 
representative of patients with paroxysmal atrial 
fibrillation.1 Cryoballoon ablation was found to 
be noninferior to radiofrequency ablation with 
regard to the primary efficacy end point, and 
superiority was not achieved in either group. 
There was no significant difference among the 
four types of ablation catheters with regard to the 
primary efficacy end point. There was also no 
significant difference in the primary safety end 
point between the radiofrequency group and the 
cryoballoon group.
Phrenic-nerve injury was the most common 
safety event in the cryoballoon group, although 
the 2.7% rate in our trial was substantially lower 
than the 13.5% rate reported in the Sustained 
Treatment of Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation 
(STOP AF) trial.12 The most common safety 
events in the radiofrequency group were groin-
site complications, which were unusually fre-
quent in this trial (4.3%). Some groin injuries

and Safety End Points in the Modified Intention-to-
Treat Cohort.
Panel A shows the 90-day landmark analysis of the pri-
mary efficacy end point. The trial confirmed the non-
inferiority of cryoballoon ablation to radiofrequency 
(RFC) catheter ablation. The first 90 days after the 
index ablation was the so-called “blanking period”; 
events during this period were not counted in the 
determination of clinical failure for the primary end 
point. Panel B shows the subgroup test of homogenei-
ty across all four catheter categories; there was no sig-
nificant difference among the catheters (P = 0.25). The 
as-treated cohort was used for this analysis. Five pa-
tients were randomly assigned to the cryoballoon 
group but underwent radiofrequency ablation; they are 
included in the first-generation radiofrequency group; 
four patients who were randomly assigned to the ra-
diofrequency group and were treated with nonstudy 
radiofrequency catheters are not included. Panel C 
shows the analysis of the primary safety end point. 
There was no significant difference between the cryo-
balloon and radiofrequency groups.

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
may be caused by the two-sheath system that is 
often used (a radiofrequency catheter and a sepa-
rate circular mapping catheter).1,13 Serious treat-
ment-related adverse events of atrial arrhythmia 
occurred in 2.7% of the patients in the radiofre-
quency group and in 0.8% of the patients in the 
cryoballoon group (P 
= 
0.09). These new-onset 
arrhythmias may have been caused by incom-
plete pulmonary-vein isolation.
Six previous studies (which were smaller than 
the current trial, nonrandomized, or both) com-
paring radiofrequency ablation with cryoballoon 
ablation have been completed.5-10 With regard to 
efficacy, four of these studies showed statistical 
equivalence between the two technologies,5,6,9,10 
whereas two studies showed a higher efficacy of 
cryoballoon ablation.7,8 With regard to safety, five 
of the studies showed equivalent safety between 
the two technologies.6-10 The FreezeAF trial showed 
a better safety profile with radiofrequency abla-
tion; this result was driven by phrenic-nerve inju-
ries associated with cryoballoon ablation.5 How-
ever, the FreezeAF analysis included episodes of 
phrenic-nerve injury that resolved before dis-
charge.5 Also, the FreezeAF trial was primarily an 
examination of first-generation catheters.
In our trial, procedure duration and left atrial 
dwell time were shorter in the cryoballoon group, 
whereas fluoroscopy time was shorter in the 
radiofrequency group. Single-step circumferen-
tial ablations were probably key to the shorter 
duration of the cryoballoon procedure. Occlu-
sion of the pulmonary vein by the cryoballoon is 
tested by means of contrast injection and fluoro-
scopic examination, and this testing contributed 
to prolonged fluoroscopy time. In contrast, ra-
diofrequency ablation requires no occlusion an-
giography, and catheter steering is achieved by 
means of electroanatomical mapping.
The case-report form used in this trial did not 
record individualized secondary catheter perfor-
mance characteristics. For the cryoballoon cath-
eter, the study did not record pulmonary-vein 
occlusion scores, time to pulmonary-vein isola-
tion, the duration of the freezing procedure, or 
the number of freezes. Similarly, in the radiofre-
quency catheter group, the study did not record 
application times, contact-force measurements, 
peak wattage, or three-dimensional mapping vari-
ables. During trial design, many of these cathe-
ter variables were not routinely reported.
The trial investigators attempted to plan and 
conduct this study so that the most advanced-
generation catheters would be used on approxi-
mately the same date and at approximately equal 
distribution. However, because of an urgent field 
safety notice and voluntary field removal (i.e., re-
call by the manufacturer) in the European Union, 
the advanced-generation radiofrequency catheter 
became unavailable beginning in September 2013, 
with some reshipping started in January 2014. 
This interruption prohibited further statistical 
evaluation of efficacy according to individual 
catheter type.
Pulmonary-vein isolation is the cornerstone 
ablation strategy in the treatment of patients with 
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.1 However, achiev-
ing acute pulmonary-vein isolation does not guar-
antee long-term electrical isolation of the pul-
monary veins.14 The use of newer radiofrequency 
catheters with contact-force sensing has improved 
long-term pulmonary-vein isolation.14-16 The sec-
ond-generation cryoballoon catheter has also 
shown improvement in long-term pulmonary-vein 
isolation,17 which may be attributable to the ex-
tensive wide-area circumferential ablation that is 
achieved.18 Extensive wide-area circumferential 
ablation may have ablation-related benefits beyond 
pulmonary-vein isolation, including concomitant 
ganglionated plexus modification.19 However, our 
trial was not powered to test the superiority of 
either the first-generation or the second-genera-
tion catheters.
In summary, in the FIRE AND ICE trial, we 
found that in the treatment of patients with drug-
refractory paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, pulmo-
nary-vein isolation by means of cryoballoon abla-
tion was noninferior to pulmonary-vein isolation 
by radiofrequency ablation in terms of efficacy 
and safety.
