A 
significant challenge in the treatment of stroke survi-
vors is the rehabilitation of chronic motor disabilities. 
Although behavioral therapies such as constraint-induced 
movement therapy1 or robot-aided sensorimotor stimulation2 
can improve upper-limb motor function, they require some 
level of peripheral motor function to engage with the therapy. 
This residual function is variable across patients and absent in 
the setting of complete hemiplegia. An alternative to behav-
ioral therapies is to engage with the patient’s central nervous 
system directly. Specifically, a brain–computer interface 
(BCI) system can measure movement-related signals from the 
central nervous system and provide meaningful feedback to 
the central nervous system to direct plasticity.
BCIs have recently emerged as novel and potentially power-
ful tools to restore function in chronic stroke survivors.3 Early 
results present promising demonstrations that BCI-controlled 
orthoses or functional electric stimulators can lead to improve-
ments in motor function in chronic stroke survivors.3–8 These 
stroke-specific BCI systems for rehabilitation have focused on 
signals stemming from perilesional cortex, contralateral to the 
Background and Purpose—There are few effective therapies to achieve functional recovery from motor-related disabilities 
affecting the upper limb after stroke. This feasibility study tested whether a powered exoskeleton driven by a brain–
computer interface (BCI), using neural activity from the unaffected cortical hemisphere, could affect motor recovery in 
chronic hemiparetic stroke survivors. This novel system was designed and configured for a home-based setting to test the 
feasibility of BCI-driven neurorehabilitation in outpatient environments.
Methods—Ten chronic hemiparetic stroke survivors with moderate-to-severe upper-limb motor impairment (mean Action 
Research Arm Test=13.4) used a powered exoskeleton that opened and closed the affected hand using spectral power 
from electroencephalographic signals from the unaffected hemisphere associated with imagined hand movements of 
the paretic limb. Patients used the system at home for 12 weeks. Motor function was evaluated before, during, and 
after the treatment.
Results—Across patients, our BCI-driven approach resulted in a statistically significant average increase of 6.2 points in 
the Action Research Arm Test. This behavioral improvement significantly correlated with improvements in BCI control. 
Secondary outcomes of grasp strength, Motricity Index, and the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure also 
significantly improved.
Conclusions—The findings demonstrate the therapeutic potential of a BCI-driven neurorehabilitation approach using the 
unaffected hemisphere in this uncontrolled sample of chronic stroke survivors. They also demonstrate that BCI-driven 
neurorehabilitation can be effectively delivered in the home environment, thus increasing the probability of future clinical 
translation.

affected hand for BCI control. Because the ability to modulate 
perilesional cortical activity decreases with increasing cortical 
damage,9 it may be particularly important for neurorehabilita-
tion systems to focus on the ipsilateral, contralesional cortex 
in those patients who are most severely affected.
Although movement-related neural activity occurs in 
the ipsilateral and the contralateral cortices,10,11 the role of 
the unaffected hemisphere in stroke recovery is uncertain. 
Specifically, decreases in contralesional activity are associ-
ated with optimal recovery in some studies.12,13 Other studies 
show that increases in contralesional activity may be related 
to motor recovery,14,15 particularly in patients with incomplete 
recovery.16 As motor recovery is inversely correlated with the 
extent of corticospinal tract transection,17 we hypothesized 
that using contralesional hemisphere activity to drive a BCI-
controlled exoskeleton may lead to functional improvements. 
Previously, we demonstrated that chronic stroke survivors can 
control BCIs using electroencephalographic (EEG) signals 
from the contralesional hemisphere associated with the inten-
tion to move the affected limb.18 However, it was uncertain 
whether emphasizing the relationship between activation of 
ipsilateral cortex and resultant sensory feedback would be 
beneficial.
This feasibility study tested an EEG-BCI system that used 
signals related to affected hand motor imagery, recorded from 
the unaffected hemisphere, to control the affected hand via 
a powered exoskeleton. This study is the first to specifically 
focus on the unaffected hemisphere with a BCI rehabilita-
tion system and the first to provide BCI-driven therapy in the 
patients’ homes. This setting is important because it increases 
the likelihood that this approach can be scaled more widely 
across the stroke-affected population.
Methods
To determine whether a BCI-controlled exoskeleton using EEG sig-
nals from the unaffected hemisphere can lead to functional rehabilita-
tion, we created a novel home-based system called the IpsiHand. We 
then examined whether a 12-week training period led to functional 
improvements in chronic, hemiparetic stroke survivors.
Patient Characteristics
Ten chronic hemiparetic stroke survivors with moderate-to-severe 
upper-limb hemiparesis, enrolled at least 6 months after first-time 
hemispheric stroke, completed the study. Because motor recovery 
plateaus after 3 months,19 the study was designed as a self-controlled 
study comparing motor function before and after the intervention to 
establish the feasibility of the BCI-driven therapy studied. The Table 
contains patient demographics and baseline motor function. The 
online-only Data Supplement contains detailed inclusion and exclu-
sion criteria. Moderate-to-severely impaired patients were specifically 
targeted because they are less likely to recover through other methods 
and therefore require an alternative rehabilitation strategy, such as 
a BCI. The Washington University School of Medicine Institutional 
Review Board approved the study protocol, and all patients provided 
written informed consent.
BCI System Design
The BCI system (Figure 1A) combined a novel powered exoskeleton 
with a commercial EEG amplifier and active electrodes. The exoskel-
eton opened and closed the patient’s hand in a 3-finger pinch grip (1 
degree of freedom). A detailed description of the system is contained 
in the Methods in the online-only Data Supplement. Consistent with 
our previous work,18 the system used spectral power changes to con-
trol hand position. Because stroke patients typically have difficulty 
extending their extremities, BCI control associated motor imagery 
with opening the affected hand. Each trial began with the hand fully 
closed, and spectral power at the control feature was used to update the 
hand position, providing visual and proprioceptive feedback. During 
rest trials, patients were instructed to try to keep the exoskeleton 
closed by imagining that they were resting. During movement trials, 
patients were instructed to try to open their hand via motor imagery.
EEG Screening
After meeting the inclusion criteria, patients underwent an EEG 
screening protocol to ensure that a consistent control signal was pres-
ent for device control. Each patient completed 3 separate screenings 
to assess the stability of potential BCI control signals. EEG electrodes 
were applied by a trained biomedical engineer, and EEG signals were 
collected while patients performed a visually cued motor screening 
task consisting of trials of (1) rest, (2) unaffected hand movements, 
(3) affected hand motor imagery, and (4) bilateral motor imagery. 
Spectral power, or the power in the EEG signal as a function of fre-
quency, was calculated using an autoregressive spectral estimation 
method. The coefficient of determination (r2), the percent of variance 
in spectral power that was accounted for by the difference between 
affected hand motor imagery and rest trials, was calculated for each 
channel and frequency. After completing 3 EEG screenings, the EEG 
data were examined for the presence of consistent spectral power 
changes during affected hand motor imagery. BCI control features 
were required to be associated with imagined movements of the 
affected hand and located in unaffected hemisphere motor regions. 
These sessions were not designed to achieve BCI mastery but to iden-
tify patients with consistent cortical activations (ie, μ [8–12 Hz] or β 
(12–30 Hz) power decreases) in at least 2 of 3 sessions. The feature 
in the unaffected hemisphere with the strongest r2 value was chosen 
as the patient-specific BCI control feature. Patients without consistent 
spectral power changes were unable to continue in the study.
Outcome Measures
The primary outcome measure was the Action Research Arm Test 
(ARAT).20 Secondary outcome measures included: (1) the Canadian 
Occupational Performance Measure,21 (2) the Motricity Index, (3) 
the modified Ashworth Scale at the elbow joint, (4) grip strength, (5) 
pinch strength, and (6) the active range of motion (AROM) at the 
metacarpophalangeal joint of digits 2 to 5. As this study was the first 
to use a BCI system for stroke rehabilitation in the home setting, we 
measured the BCI control quality by comparing the topographies of 
spectral power changes in the laboratory and home-based sessions. 
We assessed compliance by recording the total number of days and 
time that each patient used the system.
Study Protocol
The study timeline is shown in Figure 1B. After completing the EEG 
screenings, patients completed 2 pretherapy motor evaluations in 
which all primary and secondary outcome measures were measured 
by an occupational therapist. On these days, the exoskeleton was 
also fit to the patient’s hand. In addition, patients and their caregivers 
were trained to use the system. This included (1) donning the exo-
skeleton and EEG cap, (2) examining the EEG readouts to verify that 
physiological signals were collected, (3) software operation, and (4) 
system maintenance. After the baseline motor evaluations and train-
ing, each patient was sent home with a BCI system to complete 12 
weeks of training. Patients were instructed to use the BCI system on 
a minimum of 5 days per week. Patients completed 1 to 12 10-minute 
runs of the BCI task per day depending on their stamina and time 
constraints. At 2-week intervals, patients came to the laboratory for 
follow-up motor evaluations consisting of the ARAT and Canadian 
Occupational Performance Measure. At these follow-up sessions 
and as needed, an occupational therapist or a biomedical engineer 
communicated with the patients to ensure compliance with the study,

answer questions about the device, fix any malfunctions, and discuss 
EEG signal quality, which was assessed regularly by a biomedical 
engineer. After 12 weeks, patients were again tested on all primary 
and secondary outcome measures. Different occupational therapists 
collected baseline and completion outcome measures, and all occupa-
tional therapists were blinded to observed EEG changes.

Figure 1. Study methodology. A, The exoskeleton used attached to a patient’s affected hand via straps on the forearm, palm of the hand, 
and intermediate phalanges of the index and middle finger, whereas the thumb was held stationary. The exoskeleton was controlled by a 
microprocessor in the forearm assembly that processed electroencephalographic (EEG) signals. A linear actuator drove hand movements 
in a 3-finger pinch grip based on the decoded EEG. B, The study tested whether training with the brain–computer interface (BCI)–con-
trolled exoskeleton would lead to functional improvements. Patients that met the inclusion criteria completed 3 EEG screenings. Patients 
with consistent movement-related EEG activations then completed baseline motor evaluations and BCI system training. Finally, patients 
completed a 12-wk home-based BCI protocol with follow-up motor evaluations at 2-wk intervals.

Analysis of Outcome Measures
A paired-sample t test was used to evaluate the statistical significance 
of ARAT changes and continuous secondary outcome measures (grip 
strength, pinch strength, and AROM). Signed-rank tests were used for 
all other outcome measures because their measurement scales were 
ordinal. Because the exoskeleton drove extension of the second and 
third digits, AROM values for the second and third digits and fourth 
and fifth digits were averaged separately. Changes were examined 
for both the overall and subcomponents of the ARAT and Motricity 
Index.
Neurophysiological Correlates
To examine potential mechanisms of action, we calculated the cor-
relation between the change in ARAT and changes in BCI control 
accuracy, total usage time, and EEG modulation changes. To quan-
tify BCI performance, we calculated the average hand position in the 
second half of each trial. The BCI accuracy for each run of the BCI 
task was calculated by taking the difference in this average position 
between movement and rest trials. EEG modulation was determined 
by calculating the coefficient of determination (r2 value) quantifying 
the difference in EEG spectral power between motor imagery and 
rest trials. The change in BCI accuracy and EEG modulation was 
defined as the slope of a robust multilinear regression representing 
the change per run of the BCI task. The relationship between the 
ARAT change and change in both BCI control accuracy and EEG 
modulation was measured with Spearman r. To control for the loca-
tion and frequency used for BCI control, we performed 3 control 
analyses: (1) change in EEG modulation at the same frequency but 
at the location contralateral to the control site (ipsilesional motor 
cortex), (2) change in EEG modulation at the same frequency used 
for control but at a nonmotor electrode site (F3), and (3) change 
in EEG modulation at the location used for BCI control (contral-
esional motor cortex) but at a different frequency (50 Hz). Because 
patients performed the BCI task at home, poor-quality EEG activity 
was observed on some days. Thus, we included only those runs in 
which BCI control signals significantly (P<0.01) differed between 
movement and rest trials.
Results
Ten patients completed the study. Patient characteristics are 
summarized in the Table, and the online-only Data Supplement 
contains a detailed description of patient recruitment. In short, 
of the 22 patients who completed EEG screenings, 18 (81%) 
were suitable for further BCI therapy, 13 (59%) began the 
therapy, and 10 (45%) completed the study. The drop off was 
because of a variety of causes, including unrelated medical 
diagnoses, inability to comply with the time commitment, and 
poor orthosis fit.
BCI Control
After initial training, patients and their caregivers were able 
to apply EEG electrodes in the home setting to record physi-
ological EEG signals. Figure 2 shows exemplary movement-
related EEG activity observed in the laboratory and while 
at home. The patient demonstrated bilateral μ- and β-band 
power decreases in both settings. Furthermore, the patient 
had very similar spatial and spectral patterns of movement-
related EEG activity during both sessions. The significant 
decrease in power during motor imagery in the BCI con-
trol task led to a high level of accuracy with discriminable 
patterns of exoskeleton movement during rest and motor 
imagery.
Because our hypothesis focused on the contralesional hemi-
sphere, the features used to drive the BCI system were from 
electrodes over the contralesional motor cortex. Movement-
related EEG activations were also observed from the ipsile-
sional hemisphere in 8 of the 10 patients. Although the 
frequency used for BCI control varied across patients, all BCI 
control features were μ- and β-band power suppressions, also 
referred to as event-related desynchronization.22 Patients used 
the device on 37 to 72 days. Patients performed 74 to 465 
10-minute runs of the BCI task for a total of 740 to 4650 min-
utes of online BCI control in addition to the daily screening 
task. Details of the patient-specific BCI control are included in 
the online-only Data Supplement.
Functional Outcomes
The 2 baseline motor assessments were averaged to deter-
mine each patient’s baseline motor function. ARAT changes 
throughout the study protocol are shown in Figure 3A. 
Patients had a statistically significant mean ARAT increase 
of 6.2 points. Importantly, 5.7 points has been estimated 
to represent the minimal clinically important difference in 
chronic stroke survivors.23 Specifically, 6 of the 10 patients

based screening session, the patient (patient 10, left affected) demonstrated significant decreases in μ- and β-band spectral power

had ARAT improvements above this level. In addition to 
this per-protocol analysis, a significant increase in ARAT 
score was also found using an intention-to-treat analysis 
as described in the online-only Data Supplement. Grasp 
strength, Motricity Index, the grip and grasp ARAT sub-
scores, and Canadian Occupational Performance Measure 
performance and satisfaction ratings were also significantly 
increased after therapy, whereas pinch strength, AROM, 
and the pinch and gross ARAT subscores were not changed. 
Figure 4 and Table II in the online-only Data Supplement 
summarize changes across outcomes. Other than minor 
fatigue, no negative effects were observed.
Neurophysiological Correlates
Across patients, there was a significant correlation between 
the change in ARAT score and the change in BCI accu-
racy (defined as the difference between the hand position in 
the movement and rest trials) per BCI task run (Figure 3B; 
Spearman r=0.75, P=0.013). There was not a significant 
relationship between the change in ARAT score and the 
total device usage time (Figure 3C; Spearman r=0.47, 
P=0.17).
Finally, we sought to determine whether there was a rela-
tionship between ARAT and EEG changes (Figure 5). There 
was a trend toward a positive relationship between ARAT

score changes and the change in the EEG modulation per run 
of the BCI task at the location and frequency used for BCI 
control and in a site in the contralateral motor cortex (BCI 
control feature: Spearman r=0.48, P=0.16, contralateral motor 
cortex: Spearman r=0.62, P=0.06).
Discussion
This study provides evidence for the potential role of the 
unaffected hemisphere in rehabilitation via a BCI-controlled 
exoskeleton. Specifically, patients had an average ARAT 
improvement surpassing the minimal clinically important 
difference.23 In addition, improvements were observed in 
some, but not all, objective secondary measures of function. 
Although pinch strength, AROM, and the ARAT pinch sub-
component did not change, these measures are less sensitive 
in more severely impaired patients and were likely affected 
by a qualitative increase in spasticity observed, particularly 
in patients who had received botox 90 to 120 days before 
study onset. Furthermore, the grasp and grip ARAT subcom-
ponents and grip strength, which all involve distal hand func-
tion, significantly improved. It is uncertain whether observed 
improvements in general distal hand function that did not 
localize to pinch were because of the poor spatial specificity 
of EEG or the sensitivity of pinch-specific subcomponents. 
Finally, we also observed statistically significant increases 
in a self-scored subjective measure of each patient’s use of 
their affected arm in functional tasks (Canadian Occupational 
Performance Measure). These findings build on previous evi-
dence that BCI-controlled rehabilitation systems can facilitate 
motor recovery.4–8 There are several features that distinguish 
this work from previous studies. First, this study was the first 
to focus exclusively on using the unaffected hemisphere in a 
BCI rehabilitation system. Second, the BCI drove the veloc-
ity of the exoskeleton, providing a closer temporal pairing 
between brain activity and proprioceptive feedback than pre-
vious systems.4,6
The choice of a BCI control signal for poststroke motor 
rehabilitation requires careful consideration, particularly 
given the conflicting evidence on the unaffected hemisphere 
after stroke.12–15,24–28 By pairing cortical activations with 
peripheral feedback, we hypothesized that we would induce 
plasticity in the remaining (ipsilateral) central nervous sys-
tem pathways. As noted, there was a significant relationship 
between the change in ARAT scores and the rate of change 
in BCI control accuracy that could not be explained by the 
volume of device use. Further, there was a trend toward a 
significant relationship between the rate of change in EEG 
activity and ARAT score specific to the bilateral motor 
system, but not in the frontal lobe or at task-irrelevant fre-
quencies. Therefore, although what can be asserted from a 
mechanistic standpoint is somewhat limited, the results indi-
cate that the choice of a BCI control feature in the unaffected 
hemisphere may have played an important role in the ben-
efits of the intervention.

an electrode in the contralateral hemisphere, at the frequency used for BCI control but an electrode in the frontal lobe (F3; serving as a 
spatial control), and at the site used for BCI control but at 50 Hz (serving as a spectral control). B, There was a positive relationship that 
trended toward significance at both the BCI control feature (top left) and in the contralateral motor cortex (top right) but not at a location 
outside the motor cortex (bottom left) or a task-irrelevant frequency (bottom right).

There are many potential explanations that could account for 
the functional improvements observed. Specifically, although 
postrecovery increases in activity have been found in both the 
affected and unaffected hemispheres,16,24,26,29 the reorganization 
of interhemispheric connectivity between the contralesional 
and ipsilesional motor cortices may also play a role in func-
tional recovery.17,28 Further studies designed to better define the 
mechanism of action will be beneficial to better understand the 
characteristics of patients who will benefit optimally from BCIs 
controlled from the unaffected hemisphere. Because the integ-
rity of the ipsilesional corticospinal tract is strongly correlated 
with motor recovery,17 we would hypothesize that the cortico-
spinal tract integrity is essential in determining what role the 
contralesional hemisphere will play in recovery. Specifically, in 
patients with the greatest corticospinal tract damage, we would 
expect recovery to require an alternative pathway, such as fibers 
descending ipsilateral to the contralesional motor cortex.
This study was also unique in that the system was used 
in the home setting without daily oversight. Traditional BCI 
systems for rehabilitation have been used in a laboratory set-
ting with trained experts operating them.4–8 The ability to pro-
vide therapy in a patient’s home without constant supervision 
would likely reduce the cost of therapy, increase the time of 
therapy, and give patients flexibility in scheduling therapy. For 
this approach to achieve large-scale implementation, several 
practical aspects will need to be addressed, including building 
the system in a cost-effective fashion, optimizing the ortho-
sis and EEG headset design for enhanced user experience 
and compliance, and integrating the hardware and software to 
enable seamless remote maintenance and minimize the need 
for EEG quality checks.
There are also several limitations to note. Because of the 
home-based setting, it was impossible to ensure that data 
were free from artifacts. Although the majority of patients had 
good-quality EEG recordings in the majority of sessions, a few 
patients met this standard in <50% of sessions. In addition, 
because the study sample is small in size and was restricted to 
those with enough motivation to complete the study protocol, 
the scope and generalizability of the results is uncertain. Also, 
pinch strength, all Motricity Index subcomponents, ARAT 
pinch and gross subcomponents, and AROM did not improve. 
Whether this was because of the poorer sensitivity of these 
subcomponents combined with the small sample size, the 
poor spatial resolution of the EEG signals used, or a limita-
tion of the therapy is uncertain. Finally, the study was uncon-
trolled. Previous work has shown ARAT improvements can 
be achieved in chronic stroke patients after interventions such 
as constraint-induced movement therapy or standard physi-
cal therapy,30 but patients in these studies began with a much 
higher baseline ARAT score than the current cohort. Also of 
note, while shorter in duration (2 weeks), a randomized con-
trolled trial of a BCI-controlled hand orthosis in patients with 
a similar baseline motor function showed no improvement in 
a control group receiving a sham therapy.6 Taken together, 
there remains an open question of whether more severely 
affected chronic stroke patients benefit from a BCI interven-
tion exclusively versus prolonged physical therapy; a question 
that will ultimately be answered with a randomized clinical 
trial. However, this work provides important early evidence 
that training with a BCI-driven orthosis can be implemented 
in the home environment and is associated with a meaningful 
functional improvement.
Conclusions
This feasibility study shows a statistically significant and 
clinically meaningful improvement in the motor function 
of chronic stroke survivors after using a home-based BCI-
controlled exoskeleton. The use of control features in the 
contralesional hemisphere shows evidence of the potential rel-
evance of the unaffected hemisphere for functional rehabilita-
tion. Collectively, although this study represents an important 
step toward developing and translating BCI-driven rehabilita-
tion protocols for chronic stroke survivors, the effectiveness 
of BCI-driven therapies must be proven in large randomized 
controlled trials before full acceptance.
