Abstract
IMPORTANCE—Changes over time in the incidence of parkinsonism and Parkinson’s disease 
(PD) remain uncertain.
OBJECTIVE—To investigate secular trends (period effects) and birth cohort trends in the 
incidence of parkinsonism and PD over 30 years in a geographically defined American population.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS—We used the medical records-linkage system of 
the Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP) to identify incidence cases of PD and other types of 
parkinsonism in Olmsted County, MN, from 1976 to 2005. All cases were classified by a 
movement disorder specialist using defined criteria through the review of the complete medical 
records within the system.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES—Incidence rates of parkinsonism and PD over 30 
years. We tested for secular trends (period effects) using negative binomial regression models and 
for birth cohort effects using age-period-cohort models.
RESULTS—The overall incidence rates increased significantly over 30 years in men for both 
parkinsonism (RR 1.17 per decade, 95% CI 1.03-1.33) and PD (RR 1.24 per decade, 95% CI 
1.08-1.43). These trends were driven primarily by the older age groups. In particular, for men ≥ 70 
years, incidence rates increased for both parkinsonism (RR 1.24 per decade, 95% CI 1.07-1.44) 
and PD (RR 1.35 per decade, 95% CI 1.10-1.65). The secular trends were not significant for 
women overall or in age strata. We observed an increased risk for both men and women born in the

 1920 cohort (1915-1924). However, this birth cohort effect was significant only for PD and only in 
men.
CONCLUSIONS AND REVELANCE—Our study suggests that the incidence of parkinsonism 
and PD may have increased in recent decades particularly in men 70 years old and older. These 
trends may be related to the dramatic changes in smoking behavior that took place in the second 
half of the 20th century. However, the trends could be spurious, and need to be confirmed in other 
populations.
In 2008, Morozova and colleagues suggested that smokers have a 74% reduction in risk of 
Parkinson’s disease (PD) because some constituents of tobacco may reduce the risk of PD. 
Under the assumption that smoking is causally related to PD, they postulated that the drastic 
decline in smoking frequency that took place in US men after the peak in the 1940s - 1950s 
would predict an increase in the incidence of PD several decades later.1,2 However, their 
predictions have not been tested empirically, and the long-term time trends for PD remain 
uncertain.3-9 Therefore, we studied time trends for parkinsonism overall and for PD over 30 
years in a well-defined US population.3,10-12
Methods
Case Ascertainment
Extensive details about the case ascertainment were reported elsewhere.3,10-12 Briefly, we 
ascertained cases of parkinsonism through the records-linkage system of the Rochester 
Epidemiology Project (REP). This system provides the infrastructure for indexing and 
linking essentially all medical information of the county population.13-16 All medical 
diagnoses, surgical interventions, and other procedures are abstracted and entered into 
computerized indexes using the Hospital Adaptation of the International Classification of 
Diseases, Eighth Revision (H-ICDA)17 or the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth 
Revision (ICD-9).18
We ascertained potential cases of parkinsonism using a computerized screening phase and a 
subsequent clinical confirmation phase, as described in the original reports.3,10-12 The 
complete medical records of all persons who received at least one of the screening 
diagnostic codes from 1976 through 2005 were reviewed by a movement disorders specialist 
using a specifically designed abstracting form (JHB for the years 1976 to 1990; RS for the 
years 1991 to 2005). In addition, we also reviewed the records for all persons who received 
at least one of the screening diagnostic codes in the years 2006 to 2010. This extended 
period of capture ensured that cases that came to clinical attention up to five years after the 
study period were appropriately counted as incident cases, if the onset of symptoms had 
occurred during the study period (lag time between onset of symptoms and clinical 
diagnosis). The movement disorder specialist defined the year of onset of parkinsonism and 
the type of parkinsonism using specified diagnostic criteria and following a manual of 
instructions.10,19-21 To be included in our study, patients were required to reside in Olmsted 
County at the time of onset of parkinsonian symptoms, and we excluded persons who denied 
authorization to use their medical records for research.13 All study procedures and ethical

 aspects were approved by the Institutional Review Boards of Mayo Clinic and Olmsted 
Medical Center.
Diagnostic Criteria
Our diagnostic criteria included two steps: the definition of parkinsonism as a syndrome and 
the definition of the different types of parkinsonism within the syndrome. Parkinsonism was 
defined as the presence of at least two of four cardinal signs: rest tremor, bradykinesia, 
rigidity, and impaired postural reflexes. PD was defined as parkinsonism with all three of the 
following features: no other cause (e.g., repeated stroke with stepwise progression, repeated 
head injury, history of encephalitis, neuroleptic treatment ≤6 mo before onset, 
hydrocephalus, brain tumor); no documentation of unresponsiveness to levodopa at doses of 
at least 1 g/d in combination with carbidopa (applicable only to patients who were treated); 
and no prominent or early (<1 year from onset) signs of more extensive nervous system 
involvement (e.g., dysautonomia) not explained otherwise.10 The other types of 
parkinsonism were classified as reported elsewhere.11
Reliability and Validity of Diagnoses
The case-finding procedures were valid and reliable as described more extensively 
elsewhere.10,11 In brief, an independent records review by the two movement disorders 
specialists who applied the same diagnostic criteria (JHB and RS) showed 90.0% agreement 
on the presence of parkinsonism and 70.0% agreement on the exclusion of parkinsonism 
(sample classified by RS as 30 patients with parkinsonism and 10 persons free of 
parkinsonism from the 1991-2005 incidence study) .11 In general, the agreement on the year 
of onset of parkinsonism was also high (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.85; 95%CI, 
0.77-0.92).11 Finally, a comparison of clinical diagnoses of specific proteinopathies 
(synucleinopathies and tauopathies) with autopsy findings in 65 patients who had died 
showed 81.5% agreement.11
Data Analysis
All individuals who met criteria for parkinsonism and were residents of Olmsted County at 
the time of symptom onset between January 1, 1976 and December 31, 2005 were included 
as incident cases. We calculated incidence rates using incident cases as the numerator and 
population counts from the REP Census as the denominator.13 Consistent with the methods 
used in the initial incidence study,10 and used again in the more recent incidence study,11 the 
denominator person-years were corrected by removing prevalent cases of parkinsonism.22
We computed age-, sex-, and decade-specific incidence rates for parkinsonism (of all types) 
and for PD. In addition, we investigated changes in incidence rates separately for men and 
women in two broad age classes: <70 years and ≥70 years. Incidence rates were directly 
standardized by age to the total US population from the 1990 decennial census (midpoint of 
the 30-year period) when overall rates were compared.23
We performed statistical testing of the time trends (period effects) using negative binomial 
regression models.24 Negative binomial regression was used instead of Poisson regression 
because we had a number of zero counts and larger variance in some models.24 The unit of

 observation was the incidence rate in a single calendar year (directly standardized by age to 
the total 1990 US population). 23 We calculated a relative risk (RR) and the corresponding 
95% confidence interval (95% CI) to measure the average increase in the incidence rate over 
10 calendar years.
Changes in incidence rates of parkinsonism and PD across individuals born at different times 
(birth-cohort effects) were investigated graphically using birth-cohort curves constructed 
with decennium-specific incidence rates for men and women separately. Birth cohorts of 10 
calendar years were considered; the central year served as the cohort label.3 Consistent with 
the 10-year frame of analysis, we also disaggregated the incidence rates by 10-year age 
classes. We also explored birth cohort effects and period effects using age-period-cohort 
models as described elsewhere.25,26 For these analyses, we constructed 5-year period 
incidence rates and 5-year birth cohort incidence rates, and used natural splines to model 
nonlinear effects. All statistical testing was done at the conventional alpha level of 0.05 
(two-tailed). SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) and the EPI package in R (R 
Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) were used for analyses. 25
Results
Secular Trends (Period Effects)
We included 906 incident cases of parkinsonism of any type with onset between January 1, 
1976 and December 31, 2005.3,10,11 Table 1 shows the age- and sex-specific incidence rates 
(cases per 100,000 person-years) for parkinsonism (of all types) and PD in three decades. 
Figure 1 shows incidence rates age-standardized to the total 1990 US population estimated 
using single calendar year data points and negative binomial regression in men and women 
separately for parkinsonism and for PD. The incidence rates for parkinsonism of all types 
and for PD were higher in men than in women across all three decades (Figure 1).
Age-adjusted incidence rates of parkinsonism were stable for women over the 30-year time 
frame; however, they increased in men from 38.8 cases per 100,000 person-years in the 
decade 1976-1985 to 56.0 in the decade 1996-2005 (Table 1). Analyses using negative 
binomial regression models showed a significant increase in incidence rates for men (RR 
1.17 per decade, 95% CI 1.03-1.33, p=0.01, Figure 1, top left panel) but not for women. We 
also observed a significant sex by calendar year interaction (the slope of increase was greater 
in men than women; p for interaction = 0.04). The increase in incidence rates was greater for 
men of age 70 years or older (RR 1.24 per decade, 95% CI 1.07-1.44, p=0.005, top right 
panel) than in men younger than 70 years (Figure 1, top middle panel). However, the age by 
calendar year interaction was not significant.
Similarly, the age-adjusted incidence rate of PD increased in men from 18.2 in the decade 
1976-1985 to 30.5 in the decade 1996-2005 (Table 1). Analyses using negative binomial 
regression models showed a significant increase in incidence rates in men (RR 1.24 per 
decade, 95% CI 1.08-1.43, p=0.003, Figure 1, bottom left panel) but not for women. 
However, the sex by calendar year interaction was not significant. The increase was greater 
for men of age 70 years or older (RR 1.35 per decade, 95% CI 1.10-1.65, p=0.004; Figure 1, 
bottom right panel) than in men younger than 70 year (Figure 1, bottom middle panel).

 However, the age by calendar year interaction was not significant. Women of age 70 years or 
older also experienced an increase in the incidence rate of PD; however, the trend was not 
statistically significant (RR 1.24 per decade, 95% CI 0.94-1.64, p=0.12, Figure 1, bottom 
right panel).
Birth Cohort Trends
Each 10-year birth cohort contributed three 10-year age-specific incidence rates that are 
shown with different colors and symbols in Figure 2. Our graphical analyses of birth cohort 
effects revealed a possible higher incidence of both parkinsonism and PD in men and women 
born in the 1920 cohort. Men and women born in the 1920 cohort (1915-1924) are 
represented by the dotted red line with square symbols. However, in age-period-cohort 
models, the birth cohort effect was significant only for PD and only for men (Figure 3).
Discussion
Our study suggests an increase in the incidence of both parkinsonism of all types and of PD 
over the 30-year period from 1976 to 2005 particularly in men of age 70 years or older. 
Although no trend was evident overall for women, women in the age group ≥70 years 
experienced an increase in the incidence of PD with borderline statistical significance. We 
also observed higher incidence rates of PD for men born in the 1920 cohort. Our study 
provides evidence contrary to two previous US studies and one Canadian study that showed 
no trend, and particularly contrary to three UK studies suggesting a possible decline in the 
occurrence of PD over time.3-8 A study using Swiss mortality data suggested a possible birth 
cohort effect with higher risk for cohorts born before the 1920s.9
The time trends that we observed need to be interpreted with caution. First, the trends may 
be an artifact due to increased awareness of symptoms and improved access to care of 
patients, or to increased awareness of signs and symptoms of parkinsonism by physicians. 
For example, the trends may be due to a better recognition by physicians of parkinsonism 
and PD in the older subjects in recent decades, or to a more inclusive diagnostic adjudication 
in the more recent segment of the study (RS vs. JHB adjudication). It is possible that in the 
earlier years of our study, elderly persons with cardiovascular conditions, cancer, or other 
diseases were not diagnosed with parkinsonism because the symptoms of parkinsonism were 
not considered important in the overall clinical management, and were not considered a 
major cause of disability or of mortality. In the more recent years, physicians may have 
started to recognize parkinsonism even in the context of complex multimorbidity. Against a 
diagnostic artifact is the decline in the incidence of drug-induced parkinsonism observed in 
this same population during the same time period (data not shown). In addition, against a 
diagnostic artifact is the adequate agreement between the two movement disorders 
specialists, and the good validity of the clinical diagnosis compared with autopsy 
findings.10,11 Finally, the observation that the time trends were more evident in men than in 
women may support a genuine trend in incidence because the recognition of the symptoms 
of parkinsonism in the context of multimorbidity should have changed similarly over time in 
men and women.

 A second possible cause for a spurious increase in incidence rates is a change in coding 
practices in the records-linkage system or the switch from ICD-8 to ICD-9 coding in 1994. 
Because our case ascertainment was a laborious process involving a sensitive screening 
phase (inclusion of a large set of diagnostic codes to increase sensitivity even at the expense 
of lower specificity) and a detailed review of the medical records of those subjects who 
screened positive, we did not rely on electronic codes to define the disease.10,11 Although, 
we cannot exclude a trend in coding practices, we do not think that this was sizeable, if any. 
Finally, another possible cause for a spurious trend is a change over time in the percent of 
people who denied authorization to use their medical records for research. However, the law 
requiring authorization was only introduced in 1997 (Minnesota state privacy law), and the 
authorization rate has always been greater than 95% since 1997.15 In summary, over the 30 
years of study, the health care practices in Olmsted County have not changed, the in and out 
migration has been limited, especially in the age groups at risk for parkinsonism, and the 
percent of the population covered by the REP has remained stable.15
If the trend of increasing incidence rates is genuine and can be replicated in other 
populations, it has major implications for etiologic research and for public health. From a 
research perspective, the trend should prompt studies to identify possible environmental or 
lifestyle changes during the life span of the study subjects.1,27,28 If we assume that the 
association of smoking with reduced risk of PD has a biological basis, our findings may be 
explained in part by time trends in smoking.1,2 Smoking behavior in industrialized nations, 
including the United States, has changed dramatically over the second half of the 20th 
century, with diverging patterns in men and women.29 The prevalence of smoking in the 
United States peaked in the 1940s and 1950s at approximately 67% for men and in the 
1960s at approximately 44% for women. However, in the past 25 years, the gap between 
men and women has narrowed. Between 1965 and 2009 (44 years), the frequency declined 
from 51.9% to 23.5% in men, and from 33.9% to 17.9% in women.30 The decline in 
smoking rates in men may explain in part the increasing incidence of parkinsonism and PD.1 
However, other environmental or lifestyle risk or protective factors that are related to sex or 
gender may also be involved such as pesticide use, head trauma, and coffee 
consumption.1,31,32 The possible higher risk of PD for men and women born in the 1920 
birth cohort may suggest exposures that took place during intrauterine life or in early life 
(e.g., intrauterine infection, toxic exposure, or dietary deficiency).33 Further studies are 
needed to confirm these etiologic hypotheses. From a public health perspective, an increase 
in the incidence of parkinsonism and PD would modify our projections for the total number 
of persons suffering from the disease in the coming decades.34,35
Our study has a number of strengths. It is the first to consider long-term secular trends in 
incidence (over 30 years), and to analyze the data both as secular trends (period effects) and 
as birth cohort trends. Our study is also unique in the extent of clinical precision. The full 
record of each patient was reviewed by a movement disorders specialist to confirm the 
diagnosis of parkinsonism and to meticulously classify different types of parkinsonism. This 
level of diagnostic precision is impossible when dealing with death certificate data or with 
administrative data (e.g., billing data). Second, our study was conducted in a relatively stable 
population, using a population-based records-linkage system that spans across the entire life 
of the individuals included.13-16 The case-finding procedures and the diagnostic criteria used

 in the two studies that were combined were similar, so that the observed changes are not due 
to changes in methodology. In addition, all of the patients with parkinsonism were 
adjudicated by a movement disorders specialist at the time of medical record abstraction to 
reduce differences in the diagnostic criteria over time or across the different specialists. 
Third, all of the medical facilities in Olmsted County, MN are included in the REP,13-16 and 
it is unlikely that a patient with parkinsonism would have been seen exclusively outside of 
the county while living in the county. To avoid the risk of underestimating incidence rates of 
parkinsonism in the eldest age groups, we corrected our census denominators by removing 
prevalent cases of parkinsonism. However, the effects of these corrections were small (data 
not shown).
Our study also has a number of limitations. First, our study population was somewhat small 
to provide stable incidence rates and to conduct more definitive age-period-cohort analyses. 
This limitation was insurmountable because our case finding is based on the unique records-
linkage system serving Olmsted County, MN, and a study of time trends for PD would be 
highly impractical in another population without the system. Second, we could not analyze 
the time trends in less common subtypes of parkinsonism (e.g., multiple system atrophy) 
because of sample size limitations. Third, changes in clinical practice and the introduction of 
new sets of diagnostic criteria during the time frame of our most recent study could have 
changed the differential diagnosis by subtypes of parkinsonism, thus creating spurious trends 
in subtypes. As evidence against this possible bias, the overall distribution of subtypes of 
parkinsonism was similar in the previous study and in the more recent study. In addition, a 
trend in the classification of subtypes of parkinsonism should not influence the overall trends 
for parkinsonism.

 Figure 1. Secular Trends in Incidence Rates (Period Effects)
Incidence rate curves for men and women estimated using single calendar year data points 
(directly standardized by age to the total 1990 US population) and negative binomial 
regression (top panels, parkinsonism overall; bottom panels, Parkinson’s disease). The 
relative risk (RR) refers to the average increase in incidence rate over 10 years.

 Figure 2. Birth Cohort Trends in Incidence Rates
Birth cohort curves of age- and sex-specific incidence rates for parkinsonism overall (top 
panels) and Parkinson’s disease (bottom panels). The central year of each 10-year birth 
cohort served as the cohort label. Each birth cohort contributed three age-specific incidence 
rates that are shown with different colors and symbols.

 Figure 3. Analyses Using Age-period-cohort Models
Birth cohort component of the age-period-cohort models for parkinsonism overall (top 
panels) and Parkinson’s disease (bottom panels) in men and women separately. The birth 
cohort effects were displayed relative to 1920 (median year of birth for all parkinsonism 
patients; circle with relative risk of 1.0) and fixing the period component to 1990 (mid-point 
of the study interval). For a given birth cohort year (x-axis), the figure shows the ratio of the 
incidence rate in that year compared with the incidence rate in the 1920 birth cohort (relative 
risk on the y-axis).

aThe number of observed incidence cases is reported in parentheses in the table. Incidence rates were calculated by dividing the number of 
observed incidence cases by the corresponding person-year denominators as listed at the bottom of the table. We did not report confidence intervals 
because the study covered the target population completely (no sampling was involved).
bThe incidence rates were directly standardized by age to the total 1990 US population. The incidence rates directly standardized by age and sex to 
the total 1990 US population were 31.4 for 1976-1985, 28.9 for 1986-1995, 37.9 for 1996-2005, and 33.5 for the full 30 years for parkinsonism, 
and they were 14.0 for 1976-1985, 15.5 for 1986-1995, 20.4 for 1996-2005, and 17.2 for the full 30 years for Parkinson’s disease.
