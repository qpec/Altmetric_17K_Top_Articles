Earlier diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer’s disease would greatly benefit from the
identification of biomarkers at the prodromal stage. Using a prominent animal model of
aspects of the disease, we here show using clinically relevant methodologies that very young,
pre-pathological PDAPP mice, which overexpress mutant human amyloid precursor protein in
the brain, exhibit two cryptic deficits that are normally undetected using standard methods of
assessment. Despite learning a spatial memory task normally and displaying normal brain
glucose uptake, they display faster forgetting after a long delay following performance to a
criterion, together with a strong impairment of brain glucose uptake at the time of attempted
memory retrieval. Preliminary observations suggest that these deficits, likely caused by an
impairment in systems consolidation, could be rescued by immunotherapy with an
anti-b-amyloid antibody. Our data suggest a biomarker strategy for the early detection of
b-amyloid-related abnormalities.

 I
dentifying the onset of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) as early as
possible is now widely recognized as a crucial step in the
development of effective treatments for the disease. It is faced,
however, with the obstacle that the incipient cognitive, physio-
logical and biochemical deficits are extremely difficult to
observe1–6.
Several
biomarker
approaches
are
available
including
biochemical
analysis
of
cerebrospinal
fluid
or
peripheral blood, imaging of Ab plaques in the brain, magnetic
resonance imaging and glucose uptake monitoring using positron
emission tomography7,8. These have been very useful in patient
studies, but prognostic diagnosis will likely require higher
sensitivity and/or convergence towards multiple biomarkers3,9–11.
Studies with animal models derived from the genetics of
familial AD12–16 suggest that subtle changes occur in living
neurons, their synapses and networks, at a stage well before cell
death5,6,17–20. Despite understandable scepticism about such
models, these findings provide important insights towards
pre-pathological biomarkers for AD that could include subtle
alterations in behaviour and/or cerebrovascular metabolism.
Spatial learning and memory in animal models have relevant
validity as deficits in this aspect of behaviour are among the
earliest symptoms observed by patients’ families21. Mediated by
the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex in rodents22,23, spatial
learning requires effective hippocampal synaptic plasticity at the
time of initial memory encoding24. However, lasting changes in
synaptic structure that are the basis of memory consolidation and
storage engages the neocortex25,26, including regions that are at
risk in the earliest stages of AD. Memory encoding may be
normal in the prodromal phase of AD, despite the ability for
lasting changes in synaptic structure and function already being
at risk27,28. A simple if indirect biomarker of synaptic efficacy is
glucose uptake imaging. We wondered if this could be used in
association with behavioural protocols that distinguish initial
encoding from later stages of consolidation in a brain-wide
manner.
The core idea of this study is that it might be possible to
identify cryptic changes in spatial memory in a rodent model at a
very young age when memory encoding is apparently normal.
This would, in humans, correspond to a time when the disease
process is at a pre-diagnosed stage. Using a familial AD genetic
model (the PDAPP mouse), we trained very young (3–4 months)
transgenic and littermate wild-type (WT) control mice in a
watermaze29 using a spatial learning protocol explicitly designed
to dissect learning from forgetting30–32. This involved training
each mouse to a pre-determined criterion of reliable rapid escape
from the water irrespective of how many training trials this might
take (Fig. 1a). Memory retrieval could then be tested immediately,
or consolidation allowed to proceed, with retrieval tested after a
long delay. This behavioural protocol, in which some animals
were allowed to complete only part of the stages, was combined
with analysis of glucose uptake in the brain timed to be specific to
distinct phases of memory processing. We also conducted
preliminary experiments to confirm the specificity of our
observed cognitive and physiological phenotypes to Ab by a
rescue experiment using immunotherapy.
Results
Normal learning and glucose uptake in young PDAPP mice.
We trained a total of 127 mice (3–4 months; PDAPP n ¼ 59; WT
n ¼ 68) through a varying number of stages of training (Fig. 1a).
Training to a visible escape platform in the watermaze was
normal (Fig. 1b), as was swim speed (Supplementary Fig. 1).
Spatial learning to a hidden escape platform proceeded effectively
over days 1–3 of training (from day 4 onwards the mice that
reached the criterion of all daily trials averaging o20 s were not
trained further; Fig. 1c). There was a small but significant
difference in the number of days to reach criterion, apparently
due to overnight forgetting that resulted in higher escape latencies
by PDAPP mice on daily trials 1–2 (Fig. 1d), suggesting that
learning per se is largely normal. In addition, the two groups
showed equivalent navigational performance as they approached
criterion (Fig. 1e and see Supplementary Fig. 2 for details) as
revealed by a ‘backward’ learning graph33. Thus, by analogy to
presymptomatic AD patients, young PDAPP mice harbouring
low levels of soluble Ab (see below) can learn a hippocampal-
dependent task effectively.
Basal glucose uptake in separate animals injected with
[14C]-2-deoxyglucose (2-DG)34, measured across 32 brain areas
(example image in Supplementary Fig. 3), indicated no difference
across groups (Fig. 1f). This is in contrast to deficits previously
observed in older PDAPP mice at a pathological age35. Thus, in
addition to being normal in their capacity to learn, there are no
major
changes
in
brain
glucose
metabolism
in
these
pre-pathological
PDAPP
mice.
Histochemical
analysis
also
confirmed the absence of Ab plaques at this young age
(Supplementary Fig. 4).
Impaired memory retrieval and associated glucose uptake.
However, when these animals were subject to memory retrieval
tests 10 min (short interval) and 7 days (long interval) after
reaching the training criterion, differential rates of forgetting were
unmasked. An ‘Atlantis’ platform was used to avoid memory
extinction36. The escape platform is mounted on a spindle that is
initially at the bottom of the watermaze, and so unavailable for
escape, but which can be raised to within 1.5 cm of the water
surface after a pre-determined time period (in our protocol: 60 s;
Supplementary Fig. 5). The control mice showed very good
memory search performance at both the short- and the long-
retention intervals (Fig. 2a,b). In contrast, the PDAPP mice
showed good recall at 10 min but searched across large areas of
the pool 7 days later, indicative of substantial forgetting
(Fig. 2a,b). The analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed a highly
significant interaction between Groups, Quadrants and Memory-
delay (F2.5,134 ¼ 6.32, P ¼ 0.001, Greenhouse Geisser correction;
Supplementary Table 6). The path-lengths while swimming in the
watermaze were equivalent (Supplementary Fig. 6); what changed
over time was the loss of search focus by the PDAPP mice.
Furthermore, a quantitative comparison of the target quadrant
occupancy scores between the 10-min and the 7-day probe tests
showed no decline in the performance of WT mice after 7 days,
but a strong decline in PDAPP mice (Fig. 2c). Thus, young
PDAPP animals are forgetful over days.
A novel feature of our design was that it offered the
opportunity to examine brain glucose uptake during distinct
phases of memory formation and retrieval. Analysis of glucose
uptake during the final 7-day probe test (‘memory retrieval’
group; Fig. 2d) revealed a highly significant genotype � brain-
regions interaction (F3.1/116.3 ¼ 6.58, Po0.001; Greenhouse-Geis-
ser correction for multiple comparisons; Supplementary Table 1).
This interaction took the form of WT mice mobilizing glucose
availability in specific brain regions during memory retrieval after
a delay in a manner that the PDAPP mice could not. Brain region
specificity was also reported in normal mice in a study of glucose
uptake during memory consolidation that identified the engage-
ment of key hippocampal and cortical regions25. Based on a
similar genotype � brain-regions interaction, we also decided to
focus on changes in uptake in memory-processing regions such as
mid-line cortical regions, namely the prelimbic, cingulate,
retrosplenial
and
orbital
cortices,
as
well
as
the
hippocampus25,26,37. In contrast to basal levels, we observed a

 strong and highly significant impairment in glucose uptake in
PDAPP mice during memory retrieval in the neocortex, and a
smaller but still significant change in hippocampus (Fig. 2e).
Representative autoradiographs for WT and PDAPP mice for
both basal and memory retrieval conditions indicate a striking
hypermetabolism in WT mice in association with retrieval, which
was absent in PDAPP mice (Fig. 2f). We recognize also the
involvement of other parts of the brain in the observed
phenotype, possibly reflecting a more widespread activation
induced by the ‘survival’ nature of the task, but the brain-regions
interaction indicates that differential uptake is not uniform across
the brain.
Memory encoding/consolidation and glucose uptake. We then
investigated the cognitive specificity of this metabolic deficit in
different steps addressing separate questions (Fig. 3). One issue
has to do with memory consolidation being generally considered
to be a slow process37. In our protocol, it is unlikely to be
asymptotic
by
the
time
the
mice
reach
criterion,
and
consolidation would be expected to continue throughout the
7-day post-training interval. Differences in glucose uptake during
memory retrieval 7 days after reaching the criterion may
therefore reflect group differences in either (i) memory retrieval
processing or (ii) time-dependent consolidation, or possibly both
processes. In additional trained groups of mice, we therefore
compared glucose uptake during the 7-day probe test with that
shown by a group given every aspect of the watermaze training
up to but not including this final 7-day test, being injected with
2-DG in their cage at the equivalent time (the ‘training only’
group; Fig. 3a). In this group, analysis of glucose uptake
in the same mid-line structures of the neocortex implicated in
memory
consolidation showed smaller differences
between
PDAPP and WT mice compared with the ‘memory retrieval’

PDAPP mice searched equally well as WT mice in the training quadrant of the watermaze relative to the other quadrants in the probe trial 10 min after
reaching the pre-defined criterion (ANOVA, genotype � quadrant: F2,110 ¼ 1.18, P ¼ 0.31), but displayed significantly less focused searching at 7 days
(genotype � quadrant: F2,120 ¼ 4.05, P ¼ 0.016). The triple interaction of groups � quadrants � memory-delay was highly significant (F2.5,134 ¼ 6.32,
P ¼ 0.001, Greenhouse Geisser correction). A planned orthogonal comparison of training quadrant occupancies by WT and PDAPP mice at 7 days also
revealed a highly significant difference: F1,134 ¼ 11.04, Po0.001). Note: The occupancies in the training quadrant are represented by white bars for WTmice
and by black bars for PDAPP mice. (c) Change in target quadrant occupancy (7 days minus 10 min) shows modest consolidation in WTmice but forgetting
in PDAPP mice (t53 ¼ 3.67, Po0.001). These data establish the greater forgetting by PDAPP mice over the 7-day (7d)retention period. (d) Experimental

of indicating that ‘warm’ colours represent high 2-DG levels, whereas ‘cold’ colours represent low levels (see the Methods for explanation of

 glucose uptake seen after 7 days in our WT mice, but the dual
contribution of this and the act of memory retrieval may be
required to see the full difference between WT and PDAPP mice
in our 2-DG measures.
The second step involved analysis of glucose uptake in
comparator groups at the start of spatial training before
consolidation would have begun to take place. We compared a
‘basal levels group’, a group given normal spatial training for one
day (‘memory encoding’), and a ‘sensorimotor control group’
yoked to the normal spatial training group in terms of mean
escape latency for each of the six trials that day (with curtains
excluding sight of extramaze cues to prevent spatial learning;
Fig. 3a). All three groups showed similar patterns of glucose
uptake across brain areas with no significant differences between
PDAPP and WT mice (ANOVA, genotype � training condition:
Fo1; genotype � training condition � brain-region: Fo1; Fig. 3c
and Supplementary Tables 3 and 4). Note that swimming in the
pool did cause slight reductions in core temperature, but the use
of a heat lamp between trials ensured no major overall change in
body temperature across all six trials that might have affected
glucose uptake (Supplementary Fig. 7). These findings suggest
that mere exposure to the watermaze (irrespective of training
condition) and the process of encoding a new spatial memory
affected glucose uptake in PDAPP and WT mice equivalently.
The third step addressed the gradual time course of the
observed glucose-uptake change. If the differential glucose uptake
seen in PDAPP mice at memory retrieval 7 days after reaching
the criterion is partly due to the time-dependent process of

 memory consolidation, it should be possible to observe this
develop during training by comparing the levels of glucose uptake
on the first day of training with the levels seen upon reaching the
training criterion (days 15 and criterion day; Fig. 3a). Compar-
ison of these conditions revealed significantly higher glucose
uptake in the neocortex in WT compared with PDAPP mice as
criterion was reached (Fig. 3d, left and Supplementary Table 4). A
similar trend was observed for the hippocampal formation, but it
did not reach significance, possibly because of a compensatory
higher glucose uptake by PDAPP mice in hippocampus (Fig. 3d,
right and Supplementary Table 4). Given the absence of
metabolic differences at the earliest stage of training, the
developing phenotype as training proceeds might be a ‘signature’
of metabolic abnormalities in the PDAPP mice that, in relevant
brains areas, would contribute to impairment in systems
consolidation.
Rescue of the phenotypes by immunotherapy. Finally, we con-
ducted preliminary experiments to explore whether these mem-

could
be
rescued by immunotherapy with an antibody directed against
part of the Ab sequence38,39. The animal model we have used
makes use of transgene overexpression that in theory might affect
the phenotypes in a non-specific way related to the insertion of
the transgene in the genome. An immunotherapy rescue

work using older mice at an age when they would normally have
amyloid plaques indicated that preventive rescue can work
behaviourally43,44.
Our
aim
was
to
investigate
whether
immunotherapy could (i) also be effective in restoring memory
function in animals that showed no change in the capacity to
learn but only enhanced forgetting and (ii) rescue the metabolic
deficits. The second of these is a study that, to our knowledge, has
not been reported previously. As the number of animals that we
have used in this part of our study was limited, these results are
reported in the Supplementary Information.
Using young, pre-pathological PDAPP and WT mice, we
examined the impact of weekly i.p. administration of the
previously characterized 10D5 antibody against part of the Ab
sequence,
compared
with
an
isotype
control
antibody
(TY11–15)45
on
memory
retrieval
and
retrieval-associated
glucose uptake. As it was essential to have the antibody present
during both training and the post-training period if its mode of
action was to prevent a disruption of memory consolidation, we
began
administration
4
weeks
before
watermaze
training
(Supplementary Fig. 8a). Analysis of the 7-day probe test
patterns revealed that treatment with 10D5 was successful in
rescuing both the memory retrieval deficit in PDAPP mice and
the memory-associated deficit in glucose uptake. Whereas
PDAPP mice treated with the control antibody searched across
larger areas of the pool, 10D5-treated PDAPP mice displayed a
more
focused
search
pattern
in
the
target
quadrant
(Supplementary
Fig.
8b).
Quantitative
analysis
(ANOVA)
revealed improvement induced by the 10D5 antibody, together
with a significant difference in the target quadrant occupancy
scores between 10D5-treated and control-treated PDAPP mice
(Supplementary Fig. 8c). Swim path-lengths were equivalent
across all four groups, suggesting no adverse effect of the 10D5
antibody on swimming (Supplementary Fig. 9). A separate
indication of the effect by the 10D5 antibody in rescuing the
forgetting
phenotype
involved
comparing
target
quadrant
occupancy scores at 10 min and 7 days in 10D5-treated and
control-treated PDAPP mice (Supplementary Fig. 8d). Analysis of
glucose uptake during the 7-day probe test revealed a significant
effect of the 10D5 antibody in restoring levels of brain
metabolism in PDAPP mice to those of WT mice, whereas this
retrieval-associated glucose uptake in PDAPP mice treated with
the
control antibody
was
lower
than
that
in
WT
mice
(Supplementary
Fig.
10
and
Supplementary
Table
5),
as
observed in our earlier experiments.
To investigate the possible mechanisms of action of 10D5, we
also conducted ELISAs to measure the levels of soluble Ab in the
brain of the same mice. These confirmed that Ab levels (both
mouse and human Ab) in PDAPP mice at this young age
(4–5 months at the time of killing) were higher than endogenous
levels in WT mice, but still relatively low (Supplementary Fig. 11).
The data showed no overall difference in Ab levels between
10D5-treated and control-antibody-treated PDAPP mice, sug-
gesting initially that the mechanism of action of the 10D5
antibody might be by neutralizing the effects of Ab rather than by
altering
its
levels46.
However,
the
ELISA
measured
both
intracellular
and
extracellular
Ab,
of
which
only
the
extracellular
fraction
is
likely
to
compromise
synaptic
function47. We hypothesized that the antibody most likely acts
on the much smaller extracellular fraction of soluble Ab48, either
by affecting Ab levels (which would likely be undetected in the
previous experiment) or by neutralizing Ab without affecting its
levels. To test this, we performed a separate experiment to
measure extracellular Ab in the interstitial fluid by microdialysis
followed by ELISA. We used PDAPP mice treated with either
10D5 or the control antibody. Although a significant decrease was
observed following 10D5, but not control treatment, compared
with the basal levels average, this finding is not entirely conclusive
as we did not observe a significant overall effect by ANOVA
(Supplementary Fig. 12). These results cautiously suggest that
the 10D5 antibody might act by lowering the levels of
extracellular Ab.
Discussion
The main findings of this study are accelerated behavioural
forgetting in young PDAPP mice in the absence of a learning
deficit and an attenuation of memory-associated glucose uptake
measured during the act of retrieval.
The novelty of our behavioural finding is that, in one
prominent transgenic animal model of familial AD, we observe
the paradoxical phenotype of accelerated forgetting of spatial
memory in the absence of any learning impairment. This
dissociation occurs at a very young age when hAPP transgenic
mouse lines are generally considered normal. Murine behavioural
models of AD generally look at learning rather than forgetting,
and have largely focused on older ages when histological
abnormalities
are
widespread.
Often
cognitive
deficits
are
described in older mice, generally correlating with pathological
abnormalities, but the explicit dissociation of distinct learning
and memory mechanisms has not previously been explored. Our
approach was to examine memory retrieval independently of
spatial learning in the watermaze, by precisely matching the levels
of original training across groups. Quite apart from the
equivalence of learning, this enabled a definitive identification
of early-stage forgetting detectable only over a long delay. A
recent optogenetic study has, in parallel, provided evidence that
forgetting in an animal model of AD may sometimes be due to
retrieval failure49.
Interestingly, the second major finding of diminished memory-
associated glucose uptake was also seen at an age when hAPP
transgenic mouse models are generally considered presympto-
matic. Changes in basal glucose uptake (that is, in animals that
are not performing any task) have been observed at older,

 pathological ages in a hAPP mouse model35, but are barely
detected in younger animals. Although we observed no alterations
in glucose uptake during encoding or at criterion, a clear
impairment was identified during delayed memory retrieval. In
normal mice, changes in glucose uptake associated with memory
consolidation have been previously reported25. It is therefore
reasonable to propose that a contribution to the forgetting by our
young PDAPP mice is a failure to meet consolidation-associated
metabolic demands. Hippocampal inactivation in WT rats, using
a GluR1–5 antagonist during the post-learning consolidation
period, is associated with a 23% reduction of glucose uptake in
the dorsal hippocampus and that it causes forgetting50. One effect
of abnormal Ab levels in young PDAPP mice may include
targeting the synaptic stabilization in neocortex relevant for
memory persistence51.
Our immunotherapy study was, unfortunately, conducted with
too few animals for full statistical confidence. Nonetheless, using
a full ANOVA rather than separate t-tests, we did observe a clear
interaction-effect indicating that chronic treatment with an
antibody directed against part of the Ab sequence might protect
against faster forgetting in young PDAPP mice and rescue
retrieval-associated disturbances of glucose uptake. To our
knowledge, our study is the first to demonstrate rescue of a
glucose metabolism phenotype by Ab-related immunotherapy.
The behavioural finding extends a previous report showing a
deficit and rescue of context fear conditioning in a different hAPP
mouse model at the age of 5 months45, to which is now added
that therapeutic rescue can also be seen at the most cryptic stage
of the developing phenotype when learning is normal. Our
findings are also fully consistent with our earlier observation with
PDAPP mice that early immunotherapy can reduce levels of Ab
in a sub-set of mice to a point where, by way of association,
learning and memory is normal52. However, the biochemical
mechanisms of action of the 10D5 antibody remain largely
unclear. The antibody we used targets all forms of Ab, and it
would therefore be of interest, in future work, to explore whether
an antibody that specifically targets oligomeric Ab, such as
A887755 (ref. 53), would alleviate spatial memory forgetting
given its effectiveness in rescuing novel object recognition
memory in older hAPP mice53. It should also be acknowledged
that the phenotypes that we observed in PDAPP mice might be
mediated (either solely or partially) by other APP metabolites
containing the Ab sequence, in addition to Ab itself, given the
role of such metabolites in phenotypes of other hAPP transgenic
mouse models40–42. Given the role of mitochondria in neuronal
glucose metabolism and that mitochondrial transport is hindered
by Ab54, the cellular mechanisms underlying our observed
phenotypes might include impaired synaptic localization of
mitochondria.
The translation of animal data to human studies must always
proceed with caution. The CANTAB test battery represents
one systematic attempt to do this (http://www.cambridgecogni-
tion.com/academic/cantabsuite/tests) with the recent application
of human ‘virtual’ watermaze tasks to diagnosis in mild cognitive
impairment (MCI)/AD being another55. If the idea emerging
from our data can tentatively be extrapolated to humans, it raises
the possibility that the diagnostic application of behavioural
paradigms that examine memory retrieval after a longer delay
than has been used to date, in conjunction with glucose uptake
imaging (by fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography
(FDG-PET)56) or functional magnetic resonance imaging57 might
together serve as highly sensitive biomarkers of the cryptic but
deleterious effects of Ab long before even an MCI diagnosis. It is
noteworthy that in our study glucose uptake at basal levels was
found normal, the equivalent of a negative imaging diagnosis in
humans. Further, we found that PDAPP mice performed very
well in a memory retrieval test after a short delay—analogous to a
negative diagnosis in an MCI test in which memory is tested after
only a short delay. Thus, delay may be a critical parameter to vary
to establish incipient problems. Interestingly, healthy young
adults at genetic risk for AD have been recently shown to exhibit
impaired spatial navigation and grid-cell-like representations58,
further supporting the use of spatial memory paradigms for the
earlier diagnosis of AD. It has also not escaped our notice that
studies with presymptomatic subjects carrying familial AD
mutations, examining episodic memory using delayed story
recall, have revealed abnormalities up to 10 years before expected
symptom onset3,59. Collectively, these findings point to the need
to think beyond presently used cognitive testing paradigms to
ones incorporating delayed testing.
There has been controversy over the apparent partial failure of
immunotherapy in trials of AD patients60,61. However, the design
of these clinical trials has been complicated, to date, by the need
to enroll patients at a well-developed stage of the disease when
treatment may already be less effective62. This has prompted
widespread discussion of the desirability of moving towards
earlier trials, such as those of presymptomatic individuals
carrying mutations for familial AD10. It is noteworthy that the
results of a recent anti-Ab immunotherapy clinical trial, focusing
on the subgroup of patients with mild AD, support a positive
effect for early initiation of treatment63. The present data are
consistent with the view that treatment should start as early as
possible in AD, and they suggest that sensitive biomarkers that
combine cognitive and physiological measures could be used
towards that goal.
Methods
Subjects. A total of 184 hemizygous PDAPP transgenic (n ¼ 87) and littermate
WT (n ¼ 97) female mice were used as subjects (including both watermaze-trained
and untrained groups), derived from sublines 2,613 and 6,648. In the PDAPP mice,
hAPP bearing the familial AD Indiana (V717F) mutation is overexpressed under
the control of the platelet-derived growth factor-b promoter12. PDAPP and WT
mice were supplied by the Janssen Alzheimer Immunotherapy, group housed
(around 4 mice/cage) with free access to food and water, in a 12-h light/12-h dark
cycle, adapted to the vivarium, checked for veterinary health and then subject to
experimentation. The cohorts were derived from a breeding scheme involving
breeding of the original PDAPP line with B6D2F1 mice (F1 generation of C57BL/6
and DBA/2 mice) and then breeding of the offspring with Swiss Webster mice. The
subline 6,648 mentioned above is more recent, a subline started from cryopreserved
embryos and involving the same breeding scheme. The use of the two sublines in
our study has been carefully controlled and all mice used in any given experiment
of our study (including both transgenic and WT mice) were always from the same
subline. Also, all control groups were part of the same cohorts as the experimental
groups that they were compared with (for example, 10D5 treatment versus control-
antibody treatment) control for any instability of the PDAPP phenotype over time.
We occasionally observed hyperactivity of some mice in the cage, but we did not
observe any such behaviour in the watermaze. A small number of animals had
seizures and these were excluded from the study. All animal experiments adhered
to the UK Home Office ethical regulations of animal experimentation (Animals
(Scientific Procedures) Act 1986).
Watermaze. The watermaze was 1.96 m diameter, filled with water (25±2 �C)
made opaque with white latex liquid, placed on a stand such that the water surface
was at waist height, and situated within a room with numerous three-dimensional
cues to enable effective spatial orientation29. The hidden ‘Atlantis’ platform
(diameter 12 cm; Supplementary Fig. 5) was used throughout the spatial reference
memory task and was normally situated such that its top surface was 1.5 cm below
the water surface, but could be secured on its spindle by electromagnets 25 cm
below the water for probe trials before release after 60 s. It occupied a fixed location
for each mouse, counterbalanced across locations within the pool within each
group. For the visual cue task, a larger platform (diameter 20 cm) was used and it
could be made visible by placing an object on its top surface. White curtains
hanging from the ceiling could be pulled around the circumference of the pool to
occlude extramaze cues during the visual cue task and during the equivalent of the
first day of spatial learning in the sensorimotor control group.
Behavioural protocols. All behavioural procedures were conducted blind such
that the experimenter (V.B.) did not know the genotype (PDAPP or WT) or, when

7
 administered, the active or control immunotherapy antibody (10D5 or TY11–15,
respectively). The behavioural protocols were based on those of our previous study
with PDAPP mice32 with some modifications, as described in detail below. Gentle
handling took place before training, during which the animals were calmed for
2–3 min per day for 5 days. Visual cue training involved use of the occluding
curtains, 4 trials per day, for 4 or 5 days, and a changing location of the platform
across trials. The animals were placed into the pool at randomly chosen start
locations, were allowed to search for the platform for a maximum of 90 s and at the
end of the trial were allowed to stay on the platform for 30 s. Spatial training
involved pulling back the curtains to make the three-dimensional cues visible, 6
trials per day, 5 min inter-trial interval and 90 s maximum search time followed by
30 s time on the platform, for 3–10 days until the criterion of a daily session with an
average escape latencyo20 s was reached. In the case of the group of mice analysed
with 2-DG upon reaching the criterion (‘Consolidated memory’ group), training
continued for one more day following reaching the criterion, as it could not be
previously known on which day each animal would reach the criterion, in order to
time the 2-DG administration. Sensorimotor control mice, following handling and
training in the visual cue task as all other groups, were matched to the memory
encoding group for trial duration and staying on the platform (by the use of the
‘Atlantis’ platform) but had curtains around the pool and were therefore not
trained with respect to the formation of spatial memory. Probe tests involved a
single search trial lasting 60 s followed by release of the Atlantis platform to near
(1.5 cm) of the water surface and additional time (30 s) to allow the mouse to find
it. In the case of the 7-day probe test, the Atlantis platform was not used and the
mice were removed from the pool after the end of the 60-s search period. In all
training trials and probe tests, a paint roller was used to remove the mice from the
pool and the mice were then transferred on the roller to a cage under a heat lamp
for 5 min, to prevent hypothermia, before being transferred back to their home
cage or subject to another trial. For the measurements of body temperature,
subcutaneously injected transponders (Plexx, The Netherlands) were used. The
number of animals in Fig. 1b is different compared with Fig. 1c–e, as the mice used
in our ‘Memory Encoding’ and ‘Sensorimotor Control’ groups for 2-DG analysis
(data presented in Fig. 3) were subjected to the full visual cue task (data presented
in Fig. 1b), but only to one day of spatial training, that is, not to the full spatial
training presented in Fig. 1c–e.
Metabolic monitoring. [14C]-2-Deoxyglucose administration was by either an
intravenous (i.v.) or an intraperitoneal (i.p.) route (see below). Mice were killed
45 min after the 2-DG injection by cervical dislocation (without perfusion) and the
brain was dissected, frozen in � 40 �C isopentane and stored at � 80 �C until
cryostat sectioning. A terminal blood sample was taken from each mouse and used
for measurements of glucose and [14C] concentrations. 20 mm sagittal sections were
cut through the right brain hemisphere of the killed mice in a cryostat. Each mouse
that received an i.v. injection was placed in a restrainer and transferred to a heat
chamber (30 �C) for 10 min (to achieve vein dilation) before the injection. Habi-
tuation to the restrainer and heat chamber took place for 3 days before the
injection, with one session per day. Data in Fig. 1f were derived by assessing 2-DG
uptake in WT (n ¼ 14) versus PDAPP (n ¼ 18) mice after the handling phase of the
behavioural protocol without any watermaze training. Each animal was given
0.1 mmol per 5 mCi of 2-DG in 50 ml saline (by i.v. administration). During uptake,
each animal was freely moving in the cage. Data in Fig. 2e and Supplementary
Table 1 were derived by assessing 2-DG uptake in WT (n ¼ 22) versus PDAPP
(n ¼ 18) mice. Each animal was given 0.1 mmol per 5 mCi of 2-DG in 50 ml saline
(by i.v. administration). 25 s after the 2-DG injection, each animal performed a
probe test in the watermaze (lasting 60 s), was transferred to a cage under a heat
lamp for 5 min (freely moving) and then was transferred back to its home cage
where it was freely moving. Identical conditions applied to the experiments
presented in Fig. 3b and Supplementary Table 2 (only in the memory retrieval
group; WT, n ¼ 9; PDAPP, n ¼ 6), in Supplementary Fig. 10 and Supplementary
Table 5 (control antibody group; WT, n ¼ 8; PDAPP, n ¼ 6) and in Supplementary
Fig. 10 and Supplementary Table 5 (10D5 antibody group; WT, n ¼ 5; PDAPP,
n ¼ 4). Data in Fig. 3b and Supplementary Table 2 (training only group with No
Retrieval) were derived by assessing 2-DG uptake in WT (n ¼ 10) versus PDAPP
(n ¼ 6) mice. Each animal was given 0.1 mmol per 5 mCi of 2-DG in 50 ml saline (by
i.v. administration). The
2-DG injection in this group of mice took place at the same time point as the
memory retrieval group (7 days after reaching the criterion), but the mice remained
in the cage (in the vivarium), freely moving, instead of being subject to a watermaze
probe test. Data in Supplementary Table 3 (basal levels group) were derived by
assessing 2-DG uptake in WT (n ¼ 6) versus PDAPP (n ¼ 4) mice after the
handling phase of the behavioural protocol without any watermaze training. Each
animal was given 0.1 mmol per 5 mCi of 2-DG in 400 ml saline (by i.p. adminis-
tration). During uptake, each animal was freely moving in the cage. Data in Fig. 3c
and Supplementary Table 3 (sensorimotor control group) were derived by assessing
2-DG uptake in WT (n ¼ 6) versus PDAPP (n ¼ 5) mice. Each animal was given
0.1 mmol per 5 mCi of 2-DG in 400 ml saline (by i.p. administration). Each animal
was given the 2-DG injection before the watermaze trials of the equivalent of the
first day of spatial training (see the Behavioural protocols) and was killed after the
6th trial of the same day. The six watermaze trials took place around the middle of
the 45-min period between 2-DG injection and killing the mice, and the inter-trial
interval was 5 min, with the mice remaining in a cage under a heat lamp between
trials (freely moving). Identical conditions with respect to 2-DG monitoring
applied to the experiment presented in Fig. 3d and Supplementary Table 4
(memory encoding group, denominator part in Fig. 3d; WT, n ¼ 4; PDAPP, n ¼ 3),
with the only difference being that the cues in the watermaze room were visible and
therefore proper spatial training was applied (see the Behavioural protocols).
Identical conditions with respect to 2-DG monitoring also applied to the experi-
ment presented in Fig. 3d and Supplementary Table 4 (consolidated memory
group, numerator part in Fig. 3d; WT, n ¼ 6; PDAPP, n ¼ 5), in which the cues in
the watermaze room were visible and therefore proper spatial training was applied,
but in contrast to the memory encoding group, in this group 2-DG injection took
place one day after each mouse has reached the criterion in watermaze perfor-
mance (see the Behavioural protocols). The comparisons between different groups
mentioned in the text are always between groups with the same type of 2-DG
injection (i.v. or i.p.). In all the watermaze-trained groups receiving an i.p. injection
of 2-DG, the mice performed six trials in the watermaze (with 5 min inter-trial
interval), and the type of injection was chosen to be i.p. (which has relatively slow
kinetics) in order for the uptake of 2-DG in the brain to coincide as closely as
possible with performance in the watermaze. In all the watermaze-trained groups
receiving an i.v. injection of 2-DG, the mice performed only one trial in the
watermaze (a probe test), immediately (25 s) following 2-DG injection, therefore
timing the peak of 2-DG availability (30 s post-injection when the i.v. route is used)
with the act of memory retrieval. The final concentration of 2-DG in the blood was
found to be B0.5% of the physiological blood glucose concentration, based on our
measurements of blood glucose at the terminal sample (the figure of B0.5% was
not used in the analysis in any quantitative way, and we provide this supplementary
figure solely for the purpose of indicating that the injection of 2-DG involved only
low (tracer level) concentrations, and it was therefore very unlikely to have any
significant impact on the nutritional resources of the animal). Following auto-
radiographic exposure of films by the sections for 7 days, local optical density
values (reflecting glucose uptake) were determined in 32 brain structures using an
MCID image analysis system. These were transformed to radioactivity values (per
gram tissue) by the use of standards of known amounts of radioactivity included
during autoradiography, and normalized by multiplying by the concentration of
glucose in the terminal blood sample and dividing by the concentration of [14C] in
the same sample. The normalization procedure is based on the approximation that
the radioactive signal is inversely proportional to the combined blood concentra-
tion of non-radioactive, physiological glucose plus 2-DG, and proportional to the
[14C] concentration in the blood64. All 2-DG analyses were performed by the same
experimenter (V.B.), who was also ‘blind’ to the genotype and experimental group.
Immunotherapy. Immunotherapy against the impact of elevated Ab in PDAPP mice
was conducted using a 2� 2 design with four groups of mice representing the four
combinations between the two genotypes (PDAPP and WT) and the two antibodies
used (anti-Ab antibody: 10D5; and isotype control antibody: TY11–15). Treatment
took place by weekly i.p. administration of the antibody in PBS (dose: 10mgkg� 1),
beginning 4 weeks before watermaze training and continuing through training.
Immunohistochemistry. Overexpression of hAPP in the brain of PDAPP mice
was confirmed by immunohistochemistry using sections that had been previously
used for 2-DG autoradiography and an anti-APP antibody (8E5), confirming the
correct genotype assignment of the mice. The absence of Ab plaques in the brain of
PDAPP mice at the upper end of the age range at the time of killing (5 months) was
confirmed by immunohistochemistry using an anti-Ab antibody (3D6). Immu-
nohistochemical procedures took place using standard protocols.
ELISA. The concentrations of TBS-soluble Ab40 and Ab42 in the brain of PDAPP
and WT mice (using the other hemisphere from that used for 2-DG analysis) were
determined by sandwich ELISA (Wako Pure Chemical Industries), according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Brains were homogenized in cold TBS, including protease
inhibitors, and homogenates were centrifuged in a microcentrifuge at maximum speed
(supernatant recovered). BNT77 was used as the capture antibody for both Ab40 and
Ab42, recognizing amino acids 11–28 of both human and mouse Ab. The detection
antibodies used were BA27 for the Ab40 assay (recognizing the C-terminus of Ab40)
and BC05 for the Ab42 assay (recognizing the C-terminus of Ab42).
Microdialysis. In vivo microdialysis sampling of brain interstitial fluid Ab was
performed as described previously65. Briefly, the microdialysis probe had a 4-mm
shaft with a 3.0-mm, 1,000-kDa molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) polyethylene
membrane (PEP-4-03; Eicom). Before use, the probe was conditioned by briefly
dipping it in ethanol, and then washed with an artificial cerebrospinal fluid
perfusion buffer containing 0.15% BSA that was filtered through a 0.2-mm-pore
membrane. For probe implantation, the animals were anaesthetized with
isoflurane, while a guide cannula (PEG-4; Eicom) was stereotactically implanted in
the hippocampus (bregma � 3.1 mm, � 2.5 mm lateral to midline, � 1.0 mm
ventral to dura). The guide was fixed using binary dental cement. At 3 days after
the implantation of the guide cannula, the mice were placed in a standard
microdialysis cage, and a probe was inserted through the guide. After insertion of
the probe, in order to obtain stable recordings, the probe and connecting tubes

 were perfused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid for 240 min at a flow rate of
10 ml min � 1 before sample collection. Samples were collected at a flow rate of
0.5 ml min � 1 and stored at 4 �C in polypropylene tubes during collection overnight.
During microdialysis sample collection, mice were awake and freely moving in the
microdialysis cage, designed to allow unrestricted movement of the animals
without applying pressure on the probe assembly (AtmosLM microdialysis system;
Eicom). Samples were first taken at basal levels (before antibody treatment) and
after 48 h following a single dose of antibody treatment (10 mg kg � 1, i.p.).
Antibody treatment took place directly after collecting the basal level sample.
Samples were analysed by ELISA as described in the previous section. Mice were 5
months old at sampling. Levels of interstitial fluid Ab40 were not possible to
analyse (only levels of Ab42 were analysed) because of the assay used not being
sensitive enough.
