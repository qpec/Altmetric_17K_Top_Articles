Abstract
Background: Rates of emergency hospitalisations are increasing in many countries, leading to disruption in the
quality of care and increases in cost. Therefore, identifying strategies to reduce emergency admission rates is a key
priority. There have been large-scale evidence reviews to address this issue; however, there have been no reviews
of medication therapies, which have the potential to reduce the use of emergency health-care services. The objectives
of this study were to review systematically the evidence to identify medications that affect emergency hospital
admissions and prioritise therapies for quality measurement and improvement.
Methods: This was a systematic review of systematic reviews. We searched MEDLINE, PubMed, the Cochrane Database of
Systematic Reviews & Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, Google Scholar and the websites of ten major funding
agencies and health charities, using broad search criteria. We included systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials
that examined the effect of any medication on emergency hospital admissions among adults. We assessed the quality of
reviews using AMSTAR. To prioritise therapies, we assessed the quality of trial evidence underpinning meta-analysed
effect estimates and cross-referenced the evidence with clinical guidelines.
Results: We identified 140 systematic reviews, which included 1968 unique randomised controlled trials and 925,364
patients. Reviews contained 100 medications tested in 47 populations. We identified high-to moderate-quality evidence
for 28 medications that reduced admissions. Of these medications, 11 were supported by clinical guidelines in the United
States, the United Kingdom and Europe. These 11 therapies were for patients with heart failure (angiotensin-converting-
enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, aldosterone receptor antagonists and digoxin), stable coronary artery
disease (intensive statin therapy), asthma exacerbations (early inhaled corticosteroids in the emergency department and
anticholinergics), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (long-acting muscarinic antagonists and long-acting beta-2
adrenoceptor agonists) and schizophrenia (second-generation antipsychotics and depot/maintenance antipsychotics).

Conclusions: We identified 11 medications supported by strong evidence and clinical guidelines that could be considered
in quality monitoring and improvement strategies to help reduce emergency hospital admission rates. The findings are
relevant to health systems with a large burden of chronic disease and those managing increasing pressures on acute
health-care services.

Background
Emergency hospital admissions place a major burden on
patients and health-care systems. Large increases in emer-
gency admissions can cause delays and cancellations of
elective procedures, prolong emergency department wait-
ing times and increase the risk of hospital-acquired infec-
tions [1–5]. Emergency admissions, which comprise 10%
of the total health-care budget in some countries, also
have significant financial effects [6, 7]. Rates of emergency
hospital admissions are rising in many countries, creating
emergency-care crises [6, 8, 9].
Identifying interventions that reduce emergency hospital
admissions is, therefore, a priority for health services glo-
bally, and there have been large-scale evidence reviews to
address this [10, 11]. However, a major gap in these sys-
tematic assessments has been the omission of medication
therapy, which has the potential to reduce use of emer-
gency health-care services. For example, a systematic re-
view of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) has shown
that aldosterone receptor antagonists reduce emergency
admissions for heart failure by 21% over 20 months [12].
Despite these robust data, there have been no comprehen-
sive reviews to identify and compare medications that ef-
fectively
and
safely
prevent
hospital
admissions
in
different patient populations. Systematically identifying
these beneficial medications is the first step towards moni-
toring and improving their use in practice. Given that
there are existing mechanisms for quality measurement
and improvement of clinical practices in many health sys-
tems, monitoring and improving medication use may be a
feasible and efficient strategy to alleviate some of the bur-
den of emergency admissions compared with the lengthy
and expensive process of developing, testing and imple-
menting new complex interventions.
The objectives of this study were to review systematic-
ally the evidence to identify medications that affect hos-
pital admissions and prioritise therapies for quality
improvement by assessing the quality of evidence and
cross-referencing the findings with clinical guidelines.
Methods
Protocol and registration
We developed the methods using guidance on systematic
reviews and overviews described in the Cochrane Handbook
of Systematic Reviews of Interventions [13]. The protocol
was registered (PROSPERO: CRD42014014779) [14] and
published [15]. In our protocol, we specified that we would
search for any type of intervention. This overview focuses
on medications. Our subsequent overviews will describe
the evidence for other types of interventions.
Types of reviews
We included systematic reviews of RCTs published in
English that examined the effect of any medication on
emergency hospital admissions in adults (16 years or
older). We included reviews that searched two or more
electronic databases and assessed and reported the quality
of included studies. We defined a medication as any ad-
ministered chemical or biological product. We included
only reviews that reported at least one meta-analysed ef-
fect estimate for emergency hospital admissions that was
not part of a composite measure. We defined an emer-
gency hospital admission as an unanticipated admission
or readmission to hospital that occurred at short notice
because of a perceived need for immediate health care
[16]. We did not consider admission to an emergency de-
partment or an observational unit to be a hospital admis-
sion. We excluded studies reporting only scheduled or
elective hospital admissions. We excluded superseded
Cochrane reviews. We excluded non-Cochrane reviews if
all the RCT data on hospital admissions were included in
a more recent review of the same intervention and pa-
tients. When two reviews reported identical clinical trial
data, we selected the review that reported more detailed
information, as judged by two of the authors through dis-
cussion and consensus (NB and IO).
Search strategy and study selection
We searched MEDLINE (OvidSP), PubMed, the Cochrane
Database of Systematic Reviews & Database of Abstracts
of Reviews of Effects, Google Scholar and the websites of
ten national funding agencies and health charities, using
broad search criteria from inception to February 2016.
The search strategy was developed by a library and infor-
mation scientist (NR). The websites of national funding
agencies and health charities were identified using Google
searches and by our academic-clinician co-authors. We
also contacted experts in emergency admissions and
Bobrovitz et al. BMC Medicine  (2018) 16:115 
Page 2 of 14
 reviewed the reference lists of included reviews to identify
additional studies. Details of the search can be found in
Additional file 1: Table S1 in the online supplement. Three
authors (NB, IO and BF) independently screened titles,
abstracts and full-text articles for inclusion. Discrepancies
in article inclusion were resolved by discussion. Inter-rater
reliability for agreement between authors for title/abstract
screening and full-text screening was quantified using
Cohen’s kappa statistic .
Data extraction and quality assessment of reviews
In pairs, we independently extracted information in du-
plicate on the characteristics of the reviews and assessed
their quality using the Assessing the Methodological
Quality of Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) tool [17]. We
have provided summary AMSTAR scores when describ-
ing review characteristics to give a broad indication of
quality; however, full results are also provided as sum-
mary scores may obscure important strengths or weak-
nesses [17]. One minor revision to the AMSTAR tool
was made: for item 2 (was there duplicate study selec-
tion and data extraction?) reviews did not score ‘yes’ if
data selection or extraction was done by one reviewer
and checked by another. Information on specific treat-
ment comparisons in the reviews was extracted by one
author (NB) and verified by a second (IO, BF, DC, AT,
JL, RF, DN, BS, JO, OH, BN or SS). Discrepancies in ex-
tracted information or quality assessment scores were
resolved by discussion. All reviews and each extracted
treatment comparison were assigned a unique identify-
ing number (e.g. review 100 or comparisons 100a and
100b).
Prioritising therapies through quality assessment of meta-
analysed effect estimates and cross-referencing
treatments with clinical guidelines
We assessed the quality of meta-analysed effect estimates
showing statistically significant effects on admissions. We
used criteria from the Grading of Recommendations As-
sessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) Work-
ing Group [18]. Using these ratings, we prioritised
therapies based on the strength of their evidence base.
Quality assessments were completed by one reviewer
(NB) and verified by a second (DN). Two generalist clini-
cians (JL and IO) provided judgements for the indirect-
ness
domain,
which
included
assessments
of
the
comparability of populations, interventions, comparators
and outcomes between studies and of the applicability of
the body of studies to the aims of this overview.
A minimal important threshold in effect had to be de-
fined to utilise the GRADE method, specifically, the im-
precision domain [18]. To our knowledge, there is no
consensus on what defines a minimal important thresh-
old for hospital admissions. The goal of this research is
to manage rising rates of emergency hospital admissions;
therefore, we picked a threshold that would achieve this:
a 3% relative risk reduction. This threshold is equivalent
to the population-adjusted average year-on-year increase
in admissions in the UK over the past five years (2011–2016)
[9, 19]. The UK is facing the worst emergency-care crisis of
any high- or middle-income country that we are aware of. If
we were able to identify and implement interventions for
every patient group that reduced admission rates by 3%, then
the overall admissions rate would cease to rise in the UK. In
countries where annual increases are less than 3%, which in-
cludes most other high- and middle-income countries facing
emergency-care pressures, these interventions would operate
to reduce the annual rate of admissions.
We assessed the quality of subgroup effect estimates
only if the subgroup analyses were pre-specified and met
one or more of the following criteria:
� The subgroup estimate was calculated to explain the
presence of substantial heterogeneity in the summary
estimate (I2 ≥ 50% or chi-squared P < 0.1) [20].
� The subgroup estimate was calculated from a subset
of trials at low risk of bias (as assessed by the
original review authors).
� The subgroup estimate showed a significant
reduction or increase in hospital admissions, while
the summary estimate found no effect.
We considered high and moderate GRADE ratings to
represent strong evidence, since the effect estimates are
unlikely to change if additional studies are conducted
[18, 21].
To prioritise the therapies further, we cross-referenced
the
list
of
medications
supported
by
high-
or
moderate-quality evidence with clinical guidelines. We
conducted this analysis to ensure that the overall balance
of benefit to harm for the therapies had been judged ac-
ceptable
by
key
health-care
stakeholders.
We
first
cross-referenced the list with National Institute for
Health and Care Excellence (NICE) clinical guidelines
[22]. NICE is the largest UK-based organisation provid-
ing guidance on clinical care across all disciplines. It was
selected
based
on
a
consensus
among
our
academic-clinician co-authors. NICE recommends ther-
apies based on their clinical appropriateness, safety,
cost-effectiveness and feasibility as judged by clinical ex-
perts, health economists, administrators, regulators and
patients [23]. We then cross-referenced the short list of
NICE-recommended treatments with guidelines in Eur-
ope and America. We identified the most recent guide-
lines by searching the National Guideline Clearinghouse
maintained by the Agency for Healthcare Research and
Quality. If we could not find a relevant guideline, we
then searched for national medical associations and

 professional societies providing guidance on the treat-
ment for the patient population of interest. The follow-
ing guidelines were selected from search results by
consensus
among
our
clinical-academic
co-authors:
European Society of Cardiology [24, 25], European Ath-
erosclerosis Society [26], American Heart Association/
American College of Cardiology [27–29], European Re-
spiratory Society [30], American Thoracic Society [31],
European Psychiatric Association [32] and the American
Psychiatric
Association
[33].
To
be
considered
guideline-based, the treatment must have been recom-
mended by NICE and at least one of the American or
European guidelines.
Data analysis
To standardise reporting, we used international classifica-
tion systems. We described patient populations using the
World Health Organization’s International Statistical Clas-
sification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th Re-
vision (WHO ICD-10) [34]. We classified medications
using the WHO Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (WHO
ATC) classification system [35]. We used the disease defini-
tions and relevant thresholds provided in the reviews, for
example, the cut-off for reduced left ventricular ejection
fraction in heart failure (i.e., 45%). When possible, we con-
verted reported effect estimates into risk ratios (see Add-
itional file 1: Table S2 for conversion methods) [36–39].
For significant effect estimates that underwent quality
assessment, we calculated the number needed to treat to
avoid one hospitalisation and the number needed to
treat to cause one hospitalisation. For each estimate, we
used the median control-group event rate from the
RCTs in the meta-analysis [15, 33, 38–40]. When data
on event rates were unclear or not reported by the re-
view authors, we obtained the original RCTs and ex-
tracted the data.
We used Excel for data extraction and management.
For the quantitative data analysis, we used STATA 14
[41]. The results are reported in accordance with
PRISMA guidance [42].
Results
We screened 11,442 titles and abstracts and 1563 full text
articles (Fig. 1). Of these, 140 systematic reviews met the
inclusion criteria. Agreement between reviewers was good
for both the title/abstract screen (kappa = 0.85, 95% confi-
dence interval, CI 0.83 to 0.87) and full-text screen (kappa
= 0.77, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.82). Complete references, detailed
information and full AMSTAR results for each review are
included in Additional file 1: Tables S3, S4 and S5.
Table 1 describes the summary characteristics of the
140 reviews. The median AMSTAR score for review
quality was 8/11 (interquartile range 6 to 9). Review
quality was most often downgraded because the review
authors did not state their potential conflicts of interest
(AMSTAR criterion 11).
The reviews included an underlying evidence base of
1968 unique RCTs (925,364 patients), of which 690
RCTs reported hospital admission outcomes for 577,604
patients. The number of RCTs underpinning the treat-
ment comparisons ranged from 1 to 184 (median 3),
with patient sample sizes ranging from 18 to 88,367
(median 1116). The reviews contained data on 100
unique medications tested in 47 patient populations
(Additional file 1: Table S6). Altogether, 125 reviews
(89%) examined therapies for patients with chronic dis-
eases. Much of the evidence was for patients with circu-
latory diseases (53 reviews, 38%) or respiratory diseases
(56 reviews, 40%). The most common conditions were
heart failure (35 reviews, 25%), chronic obstructive pul-
monary disease (COPD; 27 reviews, 19%), acute exacer-
bations of asthma (20 reviews, 14%) and chronic asthma
(14 reviews, 10%). Hospital admissions were identified as
a
primary
outcome
in
61
of
the
reviews
(44%).
Seventy-eight reviews (56%) reported significantly fewer
hospital admissions in intervention arms compared with
control arms, while a small minority (8 reviews, 6%) re-
ported significant increases because of the intervention.
Prioritised list of evidence- and guideline-based
medications that significantly reduce emergency hospital
admissions
From the 140 included reviews, we extracted 517 treat-
ment comparisons that reported hospital admission out-
comes (Fig. 2). All treatment comparisons are available
in the online database supplement (Additional file 2:
Database 1). Of the 517 comparisons, 159 had pooled ef-
fect estimates showing a statistically significant effect on
hospital admissions. Using GRADE criteria, we identified
high and moderate evidence for 28 medications that sig-
nificantly reduced hospital admissions in 15 patient pop-
ulations. Evidence summaries for all graded estimates
showing a significant reduction in admissions are given
in Additional file 1: Table S7.
Of the 28 medications with high- or moderate-quality
evidence, 11 were supported by clinical guidelines from
the United States, United Kingdom or Europe. Table 2
shows the evidence summaries for these therapies. These
11 medications were tested in 12 comparisons; aldoster-
one antagonists were tested in two different heart failure
groups. Nine treatments were tested against a placebo
and three against an active comparator.
There were seven treatments that reduced admissions
from out-patient, day-procedure or community settings
in patients with heart failure, stable coronary artery dis-
ease or stable COPD, while two treatments reduced ad-
missions among patients with acute asthma in the

 emergency department, and two treatments reduced
readmissions after index hospitalisation among patients
with schizophrenia.
Information on the drugs, dosing, length of follow-up,
ages and event rates from the RCTs that contributed
data to the high- and moderate-quality effect estimates
is listed in Additional file 1: Table S8. Information on
the GRADE quality assessments for each estimate is pre-
sented in Additional file 1: Table S9.
Medications that increase admissions
While reviewing the evidence for medications that reduced
admissions, we also identified high- and moderate-quality
evidence for three therapies that significantly increased hos-
pital admissions: cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors in
patients for whom non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs) were indicated, intermittent antipsychotic drug
therapy in patients with schizophrenia and fluticasone in
patients with COPD (Table 3). Evidence summaries for

Summary of findings
We examined 140 reviews of 100 medications, and identi-
fied high- to moderate-quality evidence for 28 therapies
that significantly reduced admissions in 15 different popula-
tions. Eleven of these therapies were supported by major
clinical guidelines from the United States, the United King-
dom
or

creased admissions.
In the context of the literature
Previous reviews of interventions to reduce hospital ad-
missions have focused on non-pharmacological initiatives
[10, 43–45]. Our study, therefore, fills an important gap as
the first systematic investigation of medications that affect
hospital admissions. We mapped a large evidence base
and prioritised therapies based on the quality of the evi-
dence and support of clinical guidelines.
Our results complement a growing body of evidence
about drug-related hospital admissions. Several system-
atic reviews of observational studies have shown that ap-
proximately 3% of all emergency hospitalisations are
related to suspected adverse drug reactions and drug–
drug interactions [46–51]. Drugs often associated with
hospital admissions include antiplatelet drugs, diuretics,
renin-angiotensin system blockers, NSAIDs and antico-
agulants. However, the reviews have not considered the
number of admissions these drugs help to avoid and
therefore, have not provided evidence about their net ef-
fects on admissions. Our study complements this litera-
ture, as it shows a strong body of evidence supporting a
beneficial reduction in admissions for renin-angiotensin
system blockers [angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE)
inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers] and al-
dosterone receptor antagonists. We have also identified
strong evidence for a harmful increase in cause-specific
admissions due to heart failure from the use of COX2
inhibitors and pneumonia from the use of inhaled corti-
costeroids in COPD patients. Many of the other drugs

 commonly associated with drug-related admissions did
not appear in our study. Several reviews of RCTs focusing
on antiplatelet drugs and anticoagulants were excluded,
because they reported admissions as part of composite
outcomes. The net effect of antiplatelet drugs and antico-
agulants on hospital admissions is, therefore, not clear
from the published systematic review literature.
Implications for practice
Policymakers and commissioners may use these results to
prioritise quality measurement and improvement efforts.
We have systematically identified a list of 11 evidence-
and guideline-based treatments for five major chronic dis-
eases: heart failure, stable coronary artery disease, COPD,
asthma and schizophrenia. These diseases cause millions
of hospital admissions each year globally [52–56] and ac-
count for about 5% of all emergency admissions in
high-income countries [57–59]. Yet, there is evidence of
significant variation in the prescribing of some these 11
therapies in the United States and Europe, including
under-dosing and under-prescribing [60–62]. Therefore,
improving utilisation of these medications could translate
to substantial reductions in hospital admissions. Potential
improvement targets include minimising gaps in prescrib-
ing, correcting over- and under-dosing, and improving pa-
tient adherence, although the specific target of any
improvement initiatives should be driven by locally identi-
fied shortfalls in care.
The results of this study may be fed into existing mecha-
nisms for tracking and improving clinical practices in health
systems. Prescribing data for some of the 11 evidence- and
guideline-based medications are currently monitored in sev-
eral health systems, for example, use of ACE inhibitors,
angiotensin II receptor blockers and beta blockers is cur-
rently measured as part of the UK Quality and Outcomes
Framework, a pay-for-performance incentive structure that
has demonstrably reduced prescribing gaps for these medi-
cations and improved prescribing efficiency for other medi-
cations [63–65]. All of the top 11 medications we identified
could be considered for inclusion in these types of quality
assurance and incentive structures. This pathway to optimis-
ing medication utilisation may be a feasible strategy to help
reduce emergency hospital admissions.
For some of the therapies in this review, bridging
treatment gaps and improving prescribing may result in
immediate benefits and may rely only on a small number
of stakeholders. For example, we found evidence that
treating patients with acute exacerbations of asthma in
the emergency department with inhaled corticosteroids
or anticholinergics helped to avoid hospital admissions.
Optimal
utilisation
of
these
medications
could
be
achieved through direct efforts by emergency depart-
ment physicians and hospital pharmacists.
However, many of the therapies in this review form
part of ongoing chronic disease management, and bene-
ficial effects occur after months of use. Optimal utilisa-
tion of these medications would require coordination of
multiple stakeholders, including physicians in different
specialties, home care or case management nurses, com-
munity pharmacists and patients.
We can estimate potential reductions in hospital ad-
missions by combining the results of our study with data
on existing treatment gaps and disease prevalence. For
example, in studies of prescribing for heart failure in the
United States and Europe, 13% of patients with reduced
left ventricular ejection fractions who are eligible for
treatment do not receive the first-line therapy [60, 66]. It
has been estimated that 1.5% of people in developed
countries have heart failure, of whom 40% have reduced
ejection fractions [52, 67–69]. Therefore, about 400,000
Europeans and 250,000 Americans with heart failure and
reduced ejection fractions are eligible for first-line ther-
apy but are not receiving it [70]. Based on the numbers
needed to treat and baseline hospitalisation event rates
that we have reported for ACE inhibitors and angioten-
sin II receptor blockers, closing these treatment gaps
could help to avoid approximately 28,000 (95% CI
24,000 to 37,000) hospital admissions in Europe and
18,000 (95% CI 15,000 to 24,000) admissions in the
United States per year.
Our results also reinforce the dangers of prescribing
COX2 inhibitors, particularly for patients at risk of cardio-
vascular disease, inhaled corticosteroids in patients with
moderate to severe stable COPD, and intermittent anti-
psychotic drug therapy for patients with schizophrenia. It
is, therefore, reassuring that the harms associated with the
use of these drugs and steps to ensure that they are used
appropriately, if at all, have been reported widely in clin-
ical and government prescribing guidelines [71–73].
In addition to high- and moderate-quality evidence,
this study identified 28 medications with low- and very
low-quality evidence for reducing admissions. According
to the GRADE working group, these estimates for redu-
cing admissions are likely to change if additional re-
search
were
conducted
[18].
Therefore,
given
the
uncertainty around the estimates of effects for these 28
medications, we would not recommend prioritising these
for reducing emergency admissions. However, we recog-
nise that the level of evidence required to act may vary
depending on the circumstances, the stakeholders in-
volved and the available evidence (which may change
over time). If limited evidence is available and there is a
pressing need to act, lower-quality evidence may be suf-
ficient to justify cautious implementation of an interven-
tion. Our prioritisation of medications with high- and
moderate-quality evidence does not prevent stakeholders
from using the low- and very low-quality evidence if

Implications for research
Only 1% of the reviews examined the effect of medications
in patients with multi-morbidity. Given the challenges of
effective clinical management and high hospitalisation risk
for patients with multiple diseases [47, 74], we need to
identify
which
medication
combinations
most
help
multi-morbid patients to avoid hospitalisation.
Low- and very low-quality evidence indicates the need
for high-quality research to increase confidence in the
reliability of effect estimates. Some of the medications in
this
overview
were
supported
by
low-
and
very
low-quality evidence, suggesting a need for additional
high-quality research. Hospitalisations, however, are only
one important patient and health system outcome. A lar-
ger set of core outcomes that reflect patient and health
system priorities should be considered when establishing
research priorities, including assessment of mortality,
adverse events, quality of life and cost.
Similarly, there were 17 drugs with high- and moderate-
quality evidence that were not supported by clinical guide-
lines. We did not record whether the medications had been
evaluated. In formulating guidelines, the effect of an inter-
vention on reducing emergency admissions would form only
one of many criteria considered by multi-disciplinary panels
of stakeholders. We would not recommend that drugs be in-
cluded in guidelines or considered for inclusion solely be-
cause they reduce hospital admissions.
Researchers should consider reporting rates of hospital
admissions, as opposed to ratio measures; 476 of the 517
(92%) effect estimates we reviewed were reported as odds
or risk ratios. These are crude measures of hospitalisation,
as they assess admission as a binary outcome: present or
absent. These effect measures equate a patient who has
had one admission during follow-up with a patient who
has had five admissions. In patients with chronic diseases,
such as heart failure or COPD, for which hospital admis-
sions are common, rate-based measures may have greater
utility in evaluating the effectiveness of interventions.
Strengths and limitations of the study
This study has three key strengths. First, it was compre-
hensive. We identified, analysed and synthesised informa-
tion on nearly one million patients to identify the highest
quality evidence for medications that affect emergency
hospital admissions. Secondly, we minimised the impact
of duplicate RCT evidence between reviews by excluding
outdated reviews; every review we included has a unique
set of hospital admission data. Thirdly, we classified all pa-
tient populations using ICD-10 and therapies using WHO
ATC. This helped to homogenise and simplify the data,
which was heterogeneously reported in the systematic re-
views. When possible, we also converted quantitative data
to comparable measures and units (i.e. risk ratios for esti-
mates and months for follow-up duration). This will en-
able users of our review to navigate and interpret this
large body of evidence.
This study has some limitations. First, although we ex-
tracted and reported all effect estimates, we have conducted
only quality assessments on significant estimates. While it
may be useful for decision makers to know the quality of
evidence for all tested interventions, our aim was to support
decision-making by identifying and prioritising therapies for
which an effect has been demonstrated. All the estimates
are listed in the online database (Additional file 2). Sec-
ondly, we planned to examine secondary outcomes, such as
mortality and cost; however, feasibility concerns emerged
during the conduct of the review. Therefore, we analysed
only our primary outcome, hospital admissions. To provide
information about other outcomes, we have extracted and
presented conclusions from the abstract of each review.
Furthermore, medications that were supported by high- or
moderate-quality evidence were cross-referenced with clin-
ical guidelines to identify those for which the overall bal-
ance of benefit to harm was judged to be acceptable by key
health-care stakeholders. Thirdly, we excluded reviews that
reported hospital admissions only as part of a composite
end point. We may, therefore, have excluded potentially
valuable therapies. However, by excluding composite out-
comes, we can be confident that the effective therapies we
identified have a significant effect on hospital admissions.
Fourthly, we analysed clinical guidelines from at least one
national organisation in the UK, Europe or America and
identified support for 11 of the medications in this over-
view. However, it is possible that there are other relevant
clinical guidelines that we did not analyse that support add-
itional medications from this study. Readers of the overview
may combine the findings with relevant clinical guidelines
in their field to identify additional medications that may be
considered for quality measurement and improvement to
reduce hospital admissions. Fifthly, our GRADE ratings of
indirectness were assessed by generalist clinicians and it is
possible that clinical specialists (e.g. cardiologists) may have
different opinions regarding the comparability of certain
subgroups
of
patients
and
interventions.
Finally,
we
planned to include reviews in all languages; however, feasi-
bility concerns emerged during the conduct of the review
and as a result we included only reviews published in Eng-
lish. Therefore, we may have missed effective therapies ex-
amined in non-English reviews.
Conclusions
We identified 11 medications supported by strong evi-
dence and clinical guidelines that could be considered in
