Background: Morgellons disease (MD) is a skin condition associated with Lyme disease (LD) 
and tick-borne illness. Patients with this skin disorder experience ulcerative lesions that contain 
multicolored filamentous collagen and keratin inclusions. Infection with various species of 
Borrelia and other tick-borne pathogens has been detected in tissue and body fluid specimens 
from MD patients. We sought to explore this association further in a cohort of MD patients.
Patients and methods: Sera from 30 patients with MD were tested for antibody reactivity 
to antigens from the Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb) group and the relapsing fever Borrelia (RFB) 
group of spirochetes. Tissue and/or body fluid specimens from these patients were also tested 
for the presence of Bb and RFB infection using PCR technology. In addition, tissue and body 
fluid specimens were tested for the presence of Bartonella henselae using PCR, and formalin-
fixed skin sections from a subset of patients were tested using fluorescent in situ hybridization 
(FISH) with B. henselae-specific DNA probes.
Results: Seroreactivity to Bb, RFB or both was detected in 63% of the cohort, while positive 
PCR testing for Bb, RFB or both was detected in 53% of the cohort. Overall, 90% of patients 
tested positive for exposure and/or infection with Borrelia spirochetes. B. henselae infection 
was detected by PCR in skin sections or body fluids from 20% of the subjects, and B. henselae 
FISH testing was positive in 30% of the dermatological specimens submitted for study.
Conclusion: The study demonstrates an association between MD and positive tests for both 
Bb and RFB spirochetes. In conjunction with previous studies, our study provides corroborative 
evidence linking MD to Borrelia infection and tick-borne illness.

Introduction
Morgellons disease (MD) is a dermatological condition characterized by spontane-
ously occurring lesions that contain filamentous inclusions and/or projections.1,2 The 
presence of unusual filaments is the key diagnostic feature of this dermopathy. These 
cutaneous filaments are firmly attached, lying under, embedded in, or projecting from 
skin, and can be white, black or vibrant hues of other colors.1–4
Many physicians maintain that MD is synonymous with delusions of parasitosis 
(DOP), that it is purely psychogenic in origin and that the filaments are implanted 
textile fibers.5,6 In contrast, detailed scientific studies demonstrate that the disorder is 
associated with Lyme disease (LD) and other tick-borne illnesses and that the fibers 
are hair-like collagen and keratin filamentous growths produced by skin cells in the

deeper layers of the epidermis, the upper layers of the dermis 
and the root sheath of hair follicles.2–4,7,8 The coloration of 
blue fibers is due to melanin pigmentation, which is a find-
ing that provides further proof that the fibers are not textile 
in origin.3,4,7,8
MD is not exclusively a skin disorder. It can be accompa-
nied by Lyme-like symptoms such as fatigue, joint inflamma-
tion, cardiac manifestations and neuropathy, which suggest a 
spirochetal relationship.1–4,9–12 Results from two independent 
cohort studies established that LD was present in almost all 
patients with this disorder. A 2010 study reported that 98% 
of its 122 subjects either tested serologically positive for LD 
or were clinically diagnosed with LD.1 Similar results were 
reported in a 2018 study in which 100% of a cohort of 60 MD 
patients tested positive for LD.13 Two independent studies, one 
in Australian patients and one in North American patients, 
reported that MD occurs in a subset of approximately 6% 
of LD patients.13,14 This evidence suggests that MD may be 
a physiological reaction to the presence of Borrelia spiro-
chetes and coinfecting pathogens in genetically predisposed 
LD patients.3,4
Positive serology and/or molecular testing for Borrelia 
burgdorferi (Bb) and relapsing fever Borrelia (RFB) has been 
reported in MD patients, and positive tests for coinfecting 
tick-borne pathogens (Babesia spp., Bartonella, Rickett-
sia, Ehrlichia and Anaplasma) have also been described 
in patients with this dermopathy.3,4,11–13,15 Both arthropod-
vectored (Bartonella spp.) and other non-arthropod-vectored, 
human-associated pathogens (Treponema denticola and 
Helicobacter pylori) have been detected in skin specimens 
from MD patients.3,4 These pathogens may play an etiologi-
cal role in MD evolution or may be exacerbating factors that 
worsen the condition.
Positive testing for Borrelia and other pathogens in MD 
patients has only recently been described, and therefore evi-
dence of an infectious etiology is controversial. We sought 
to undertake a confirmatory study using both serological 
and PCR methods to demonstrate Borrelia infection in 30 
randomly selected MD patients who met the key diagnostic 
criterion of MD. We also performed molecular testing for 
Bartonella henselae to ascertain the prevalence of this infec-
tion in MD patients.
Patients and methods
Patients and specimen collection
Adult participants from across North America either accessed 
the study via the Charles E. Holman Morgellons Disease 
Foundation or contacted the researchers independently. 
Informed consent for specimen collection and study partici-
pation was obtained from each patient, and the identities of 
participants were kept strictly confidential. The study protocol 
was approved by the Western Institutional Review Board 
(WIRB), Puyallup, WA, USA. Additional written consent 
to publish data resulting from this study was obtained for 
each patient. The study was conducted in accordance with 
the Declaration of Helsinki.
Participants were included in the chronological order in 
which they volunteered. All volunteers were included pro-
viding they met the diagnostic criterion for MD: embedded 
or projecting white, black or colored cutaneous filaments 
documented by a healthcare professional. Prior testing for 
LD or other tick-borne illnesses was not required nor was 
that information provided to the researchers. Patient samples 
without demographic information were sent to the laboratory 
conducting the testing, and this information was only added 
to the data and analyzed after laboratory testing had been 
concluded. Participants who had lesions containing thick-
ened callus material were invited to collect and submit skin 
specimens for further evaluation using histological sectioning 
and special staining for Bartonella spp.
laboratory testing
All experimental tests were conducted at IGeneX Laboratory 
(Palo Alto, CA, USA), which is a high-complexity testing 
laboratory with Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amend-
ments (CLIA) certification.
Borrelia Western blot (WB) testing
The WB assays were performed as described previously to 
detect IgM and IgG antibodies reactive to Bb and RFB.16,17 
Nitrocellulose strips for the Bb WB were prepared from 
whole cell lysates of a mixture of the Bbss strains B31 and 
297, as previously described.16 Nitrocellulose strips for the 
RFB WB were prepared from whole cell lysates of two RFB 
species, Borrelia hermsii and Borrelia turcica, that cross-
react with RFB species known to infect human beings.17 Thus, 
the RFB WB assay used in this study detected antibodies 
reactive with RFB but did not differentiate this group at the 
species level.
The Bb and RFB strips were reacted with test sera from 
the MD patients, positive control sera from patients with 
confirmed LD and RFB and negative control sera from 
uninfected people. Each strip was labeled and soaked in 1 
mL of diluent (100 mM Tris, 0.9% NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20% 
and 1% nonfat dry milk) for 5 minutes in a trough; then, 
10 µL aliquots of each test or control serum were added to

Tick-borne infection and Morgellons disease
a separate strip in troughs. The strips were then incubated at 
ambient temperature for 1 hour, followed by three washes 
with wash buffer (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) at ambi-
ent temperature. The remaining final wash solution was 
aspirated, after which the strips were incubated for 1 hour 
with alkaline phosphate-conjugated goat antihuman IgG and 
IgM (KPL) to detect IgG and IgM, respectively, at l:10,000 
dilution for IgG and l:6,000 dilution for IgM, then they were 
washed three times. The bands were then visualized by reac-
tion with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphatenitro-blue 
tetrazolium (BCIP/NBT; KPL). The enzymatic reactions 
were concluded by washing with distilled water at the point 
in time when a calibration control produced a visible band 
at 39 kDa. The calibration control consisted of an alkaline 
phosphatase-conjugated rabbit antibody to the 39/93 kDa 
Bbsl antigens (Strategic Biosciences, Stow, MA, USA) 
diluted in human serum, as previously described.16 Bands 
displaying a lower intensity than the calibration control were 
reported as negative.
Bb WB testing for IgM and IgG reactivity was interpreted 
as positive if two bands from the following 6 antigens were 
reactive: 23, 31, 34, 39, 41 and 93 kDa, with the following 
exceptions: for the IgG WB, if only the 31 and 41 or 31 and 
93 kDa bands were reactive the assay was interpreted as 
indeterminate; and for the IgM WB, if only the 41 and 93 
kDa bands were reactive the assay was interpreted as negative. 
Positive and negative controls were run with all Bb WB tests.
RFB WB testing for IgM and IgG reactivity was performed 
using separate strips for the B. hermsii and B.  
turcica species. 
RFB WB testing for either IgM or IgG was interpreted as 
positive if two bands from the following four antigens were 
reactive on the strips from either species: 21–23, Glycero-
phosphodiester phosphodiesterase (GlpQ), 41 and 70–75kDa. 
Positive and negative controls were run with all RFB WB tests.
Borrelia PCr testing
Clinical samples were tested by multiplex PCR for the detec-
tion of Bb, as described previously.18 PCR testing for RFB 
was performed using quantitative PCR (qPCR) targeting a 
16S rDNA fragment. The Borrelia derivation of all positive 
Bb and RFB amplicons was confirmed by Sanger sequencing.
B. henselae PCr testing
Clinical samples were tested by PCR amplification of a 
Bartonella-specific DNA target. The PCR primers were 
targeted to a 320 bp fragment at the 5′ end of 16S rDNA. 
The Bartonella derivation of these 320 bp amplicons was 
confirmed by Sanger sequencing.
B. henselae fluorescent in situ 
hybridization (FIsh) testing
Formalin-fixed paraffin embedded skin tissue samples were 
deparaffinized as described previously.19 After the final wash 
with phosphate-buffered saline, the slides were dried and 
the skin sections were hybridized with a Bartonella-specific 
probe targeted to the 5′ end of a Bartonella 16S rDNA frag-
ment. The sections were labeled with Alexa 488 fluorescein 
isothiocyanate (FITC) dye in chaotropic buffer at 37°C for 30 
minutes, followed by three 2-minute washes in wash buffer 
(saline–sodium citrate containing SDS) at ambient tempera-
ture. The sections were then counterstained with Sudan Black 
(Sigma-Aldrich Co., St Louis, MO, USA) for 20 minutes and 
dried in complete darkness. A drop of mounting medium 
was then added, and the sections were covered with a glass 
coverslip. Sections were read at 1,000× magnification using 
a light-emitting diode (LED) light source with custom filter 
sets (Fraen Corp, Cusago, Italy) for viewing green (excita-
tion 490 nm; emission 529–530 nm band-pass filter) in an 
Olympus BX laboratory light microscope.
Results
Demographics
The patient cohort consisted of 3 male and 27 female subjects 
ranging in the age from 37 to 87 years with a mean age ± SD 
of 58.1±12.4 years. Patients resided in 10 US states (Texas, 
Virginia, California, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Indiana, Ten-
nessee, Missouri, Washington and Colorado) and in three 
Canadian provinces (Alberta, Quebec and Ontario). The 
majority of patients resided in the province of Alberta (12) 
and the state of Texas (7). The geographic distribution and test 
results of patients are shown in Figure 1, and demographic 
data are listed in Table 1.
Borrelia WB testing
Serum samples from all 30 patients with MD were tested for 
reactivity to Bb and RFB antigens by WB. Of the sera tested 
for each subject, 19/30 (63.3%) were interpreted as positive 
for either Bb and/or RFB. Of these, 4/30 (13.3%) reacted to 
Bb antigens alone, 11/30 (36.7%) reacted to RFB antigens 
alone, and dual reactivity with both Bb and RFB was detected 
in 4/30 (13.3%). Serum from 11/30 patients (36.7%) failed 
to react to antigens of either Bb or RFB group. Borrelia WB 
testing results are summarized in Table 2.
Borrelia PCr testing

using PCR technology. Amplicons to Bb DNA targets were 
obtained for specimens from 16/30 patients (53.3%). Ampli-
cons to RFB DNA targets were obtained for specimens from 
9/30 patients (30%). Of those patients from whom amplicons 
were obtained, 7/30 (23.3%) were positive for Bb amplicons 
but not RFB amplicons, 8/30 (26.7%) were positive for RFB 
amplicons but not Bb amplicons, 1/30 (3.3%) was positive for 
both Bb and RFB amplicons, and 14/30 (46.7%) subjects were 
negative. Borrelia PCR results are summarized in Table 3.
Combined Borrelia WB and PCr testing
All 30 patients with MD were tested for Bb and/or RFB 
infection by both WB and PCR amplification of target DNA. 
Of the subjects tested, 27/30 (90%) had a positive test result 
(either WB or PCR) for either Bb and/or RFB infection. 
Of these, 7/30 (23.3%) tested positive for Bb alone; 15/30 
(50%) tested positive for RFB alone and 5/30 (16.7%) tested 
positive for both Bb and RFB. Only 3/30 (10%) tested nega-
tive for both spirochete species. Of the three patients whose 
tests were negative, two were taking antibiotics at the time 
of sampling. In the MD cohort, 4/30 (13.3%) tested positive 
for Bb alone by both WB seroreactivity and PCR detection 
of Bb DNA, 4/30 (13.3%) tested positive for RFB alone by 
both WB seroreactivity and PCR detection of RFB DNA, 
and 0/30 (0%) tested positive for both Bb and RFB by WB 
seroreactivity to Bb and RFB antigens and PCR detection 
of Bb and RFB DNA. Combined testing of Bb and RFB by 
WB and PCR is summarized in Table 4.
B. henselae PCr testing
Blood specimens from all 30 patients and skin specimens 
from 10 patients with MD were submitted for PCR ampli-
fication of B. henselae PCR gene targets. Amplicons from 
blood and/or skin specimens were obtained for samples from 
6/30 (20%) of the patients. B. henselae PCR results are sum-
marized in Table 5.

for the  
detection of B. henselae target DNA. In the skin 
sections from these subjects, 3/10 (30%) demonstrated 
positive FISH tests. Of the three patients who tested posi-
tive by FISH, two were also positive by PCR amplification 
of target DNA. B. henselae FISH results are summarized 
in Table 5.
Discussion
Positive testing for Borrelia has consistently been detected 
in MD patients, and consequently a spirochetal etiology 
for this filamentous dermopathy has been proposed.3,4,11,12 
Serological and/or molecular positivity for Bbss is most 
consistently detected in MD patients, but positive testing 
for the Bbsl species Borrelia garinii and the RFB species 
Borrelia miyamotoi and B. hermsii has also been found in 
patients with this dermopathy.3,4,11,12,15 Serological and/or 
molecular positivity for Borrelia species was detected in 90%

of the MD subjects in this study, supporting the association 
between Borrelia and MD. Although we did not find positive 
tests in all of our subjects, positive testing for Bb and RFB 
was present at a much higher rate than would be expected 
for the general population.20–22 Positive testing was more 
frequently detected for RFB than for Bb, and a significant 
number of patients had dual positivity for both Bb and RFB. 
Thus, the evidence demonstrates that MD is associated with 
a spectrum of Borrelia organisms rather than Bb alone. This 
variation may complicate the clinical picture in MD patients.

primarily vectored by softbodied (argasid) ticks, and B. recur-
rentis is transmitted by the human body louse. Although most 
tickborne RFB species are transmitted by argasid ticks, B. 
miyamotoi and B. lonestari are transmitted by ixodid ticks.29,30
Testing for Borrelia is primarily focused on LD. The 
commercial two-tier serological test for LD endorsed by 
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is 
highly specific for Bbss because it is based on detection of a 
single Bbss laboratory strain, B31.16,31–34 False negatives are 
common and can be caused by factors such as patient sero-
negativity and genetic diversity among Borrelia strains.31–38 
Thus commercial serological tests for LD fail to capture the 
genetic spectrum of Borrelia capable of causing infection.31–38 
Serological testing for RFB is not commonly performed 
and is currently only available through a limited number of 
laboratories using “home brew” tests.17,29 Testing for MD and 
“Lyme-like illness” should embrace the diversity of Borrelia, 
including both Bb and RFB.17,33,36,38 WB band patterns for Bb 
and RFB are unique, and serological tests based on one group 
of antigens will not adequately detect the other.17 Our study 
emphasizes the necessity of testing for both Bb and RFB, 
not only in the MD population but in all suspected cases of 
tickborne disease.
PCR technology detected Bb and RFB infections in 
53.3% of this cohort of MD patients, including cases that 
were missed by WB serological testing. For LD testing, the 
CDC does not recommend direct detection methods such 
as PCR detection of DNA, antigen detection, or culture.3,4,39 
Serological techniques alone would miss valuable diagnostic 
evidence of infection for a sizable proportion of MD cases, 
particularly if the testing is only based on Bbss strain B31. 
Direct detection methods could offer useful clinical insight 
in suspected cases that are seronegative for LD.
Our study has several limitations, as outlined below. The 
cohort was too small to determine if there is a geographi-
cal pattern of infection among MD subjects. There were

Tick-borne infection and Morgellons disease
significant participant numbers only from the province of 
Alberta and the state of Texas (Figure 1 and Table 1). Our 
study selection was skewed to these two geographical areas 
because the Charles E. Holman Morgellons Disease Foun-
dation is based in Texas and one of the authors of this study 
resides in Alberta. Thus referring doctors and volunteering 
participants had greater awareness of MD in these locations. 
While the numbers are not statistically significant because 
of the small cohort size and weighted recruitment, Bb was 
more frequently detected in Alberta subjects (5/10, 50%) 
than in Texas subjects (2/7, 28%). Further studies with larger 
numbers of patients using broader recruitment methodolo-
gies are needed to better understand the distribution pattern 
of different spirochetal infections.
Of the three subjects who tested negatively, two were tak-
ing antibiotics during the time of specimen collection. This 
may have influenced the test results for these two individu-

als, but no test for Borrelia is 100% sensitive.16 It is possible 
that the negative subjects were infected with Borrelia strains 
that were not captured by the techniques employed in this 
study. However, it is also possible that spirochetes other than 
Borrelia such as Treponema and Leptospira may elicit this 
dermatological condition, and there is published evidence 
supporting this hypothesis. Dual infection with the human 
periodontal spirochete Treponema denticola and Bb has 
been reported in MD subjects.3,4 Spirochetal infection with 
a variety of treponemal species causes a filamentous skin 
disorder in cattle, bovine digital dermatitis, that resembles 
MD.2 In 1935 and 1938, cases of delusional parasitosis bear-
ing symptomatic similarities to MD were published by the 
French physician Vié and the Swedish physician Ekbom who 
reported, respectively, that 6/8 and 3/7 of their case subjects 
had syphilis.4 Thus it is possible that in these cases the etiol-
ogy of MD symptoms was a pathogen other than Borrelia.
Other pathogens have been detected in MD tissue and 
body fluid specimens, some of which can be tickborne (Bar-
tonella and Rickettsia spp.) and others that are commonly 
encountered in humans (Treponema denticola and Helico-
bacter pylori).3,4,14,40–43 We detected B. henselae co-infection 
in our MD cohort using PCR (20% of blood and/or skin 
samples positive) and FISH (30% of skin samples positive). 
Thus positive testing for this pathogen appears to occur in a 
subgroup of MD patients, confirming the findings of previous 
studies.1,13 Co-infecting vector-borne pathogens such as B. 
henselae could be co-involved primary etiological factors in 
some MD patients or they may be secondary or exacerbating 
factors. Likewise, T. denticola and H. pylori could be pri-
mary or secondary etiological factors in MD evolution. As in 
previous studies,1,2,5,13 our cohort was comprised of primarily 
middle-aged Caucasian women. Etiological factors in MD 
such as pathogen variation, genetic background, hormonal 
influences, and immune status remain to be fully elucidated.3,4
Conclusion
MD is associated with positive testing for spirochetal patho-
gens. Both Bb and RFB are encountered in the MD patient 
population and appear to be important primary etiological 
factors. MD may also be associated with tick-borne coinfec-
tions that could play a role in the evolution of dermopathy. 
The fact that RFB infection appears equal to Bb in terms of 
frequency highlights the complexity of Borrelia infection 
in this patient population and the need for better testing that 
reflects spirochetal genetic diversity. The role of Borrelia and 
coinfecting pathogens in the development of MD warrants 
further investigation.
