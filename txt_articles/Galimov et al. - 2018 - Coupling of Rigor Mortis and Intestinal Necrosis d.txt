In Brief
Galimov et al. describe mechanisms of
organismal death in C. elegans. They
document a rigor mortis-like wave of
muscle hyper-contraction accompanied
by Ca2+ release and falling ATP, which is
coupled to the previously described wave
of intestinal necrosis in a process that
resembles a distorted and deadly

SUMMARY
Organismal death is a process of systemic collapse
whose mechanisms are less well understood than
those of cell death. We previously reported that
death in C. elegans is accompanied by a calcium-
propagated wave of intestinal necrosis, marked by
a wave of blue autofluorescence (death fluores-
cence). Here, we describe another feature of organ-
ismal death, a wave of body wall muscle contraction,
or death contraction (DC). This phenomenon is
accompanied by a wave of intramuscular Ca2+
release and, subsequently, of intestinal necrosis.
Correlation of directions of the DC and intestinal ne-
crosis waves implies coupling of these death pro-
cesses. Long-lived insulin/IGF-1-signaling mutants
show reduced DC and delayed intestinal necrosis,
suggesting possible resistance to organismal death.
DC resembles mammalian rigor mortis, a postmor-
tem necrosis-related process in which Ca2+ influx
promotes muscle hyper-contraction. In contrast to
mammals, DC is an early rather than a late event in
C. elegans organismal death.
INTRODUCTION
What is death? Viewed from a medical or legal perspective,
death is the ‘‘permanent cessation of the critical functions of
the organism as a whole’’ (Bernat, 1998), and the criteria for
defining human death are circulatory system failure and brain
death (Bernat, 2013). However, from a biological perspective,
death appears quite different, in that the body of the person
just declared dead actually remains full of life. At that point,
most of the cells and organs are still alive (as demonstrated by
the efficacy of organ transplants from cadavers), and the timing
of the death of specific organs and tissues after legal death
varies considerably, due to differing vulnerability to hypoxia
(Knight et al., 1997). Moreover, complex postmortem changes
in gene expression have been recorded (Pozhitkov et al.,
2017). Thus, in biological terms, death is more a process than
an event (Morison, 1971).
The mechanisms of organismal death, how it happens and
how it is triggered, its exact beginning and ending, are a ne-
glected topic within biology yet important for understanding fatal
diseases, including those caused by aging. Although many major
causes of death involve visible pathology (e.g., cancers), how
exactly many types of pathology lead to death is unclear (with
the notable exception of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular pa-
thologies). Death can also occur without easily identifiable
causes, particularly in the elderly, where it is often ascribed to
‘‘death of old age’’ (Meadows, 2007). Likewise, the exact causes
of death in senescent laboratory rodents are often unclear, with
postmortem (necropsy) studies failing to detect pathology in up
to 10%–30% of mice (Maronpot, 1999; Son, 2003). Furthermore,
in many cases the presence of pathology can prove only that the
animal died with the pathology, not because of it. Studying the
biology of organismal death is worthwhile since the knowledge
obtained can help us to understand how both senescent and
non-senescent pathologies cause organismal death and to
devise treatments to bring back critically ill patients from the
brink of death.
The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is a convenient model
organism for the study of complex biological processes, and it
is well suited for investigations of organismal death. This is
particularly relevant to the ongoing endeavor of understanding
the biology of aging using this organism. While numerous
long-lived C. elegans mutants have been isolated and molecular
pathways influencing lifespan discovered (Kenyon, 2010; Lap-
ierre and Hansen, 2012), the causes of the increase in mortality
rate during aging in C. elegans remain unclear. As the terminal
event that determines lifespan, it is important to understand
organismal death and how it is triggered by senescent
pathology.
Our
previous
study
described
the
occurrence
during
C. elegans organismal death of a calcium-propagated wave of
necrotic cell death in the intestine, typically in an anterior-to-
posterior (AP) direction (Coburn et al., 2013). Under UV light,
this wave is rendered visible as a wave of blue autofluorescence
(death fluorescence [DF]), caused by the release of tryptophan-
derived anthranilates from degenerating lysosome-related or-
ganelles (Coburn et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2016a). It was once
thought that the age increase in intestinal autofluorescence re-
flects the accumulation of the damage product lipofuscin, but
several observations argue against this interpretation (Coburn
et al., 2013; Coburn and Gems, 2013; Pincus et al., 2016).
Organismal death in C. elegans is also accompanied by
changes in body volume, with an initial reduction in size followed
by recovery of pre-death body size (Stroustrup et al., 2013). An

 interesting possibility is that this phenomenon is related to rigor
mortis, another Ca2+ release-driven death-related process. In
rigor mortis (stiffness of death), there occurs a transient postmor-
tem muscle contraction that results from the biochemical
changes that take place in dying muscle cells. In forensic sci-
ence, assessment of rigor mortis can help to estimate time of
death (Mathur and Agrawal, 2011). Rigor mortis is also of interest
to the meat industry since its onset and resolution underlies the
process of meat tenderization (Huff Lonergan et al., 2010; Paredi
et al., 2012). Rigor mortis has been studied previously in several
mammalian species, but not in invertebrates.
The immediate cause of muscle contraction during rigor mortis
appears to be ATP depletion (Bate-Smith and Bendall, 1947; Ka-
wai and Brandt, 1976). In normal muscle physiology, Ca2+ ions
are released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) to initiate
the muscle contraction cycle. During relaxation, calcium is
pumped back into the SR via ATP-dependent channels (Slack
et al., 1997). After death, when respiration in muscles becomes
impossible due to the lack of oxygen circulation, the principal
sources of ATP become glycolysis and creatine phosphate
stores
(Bate-Smith
and
Bendall,
1956).
When
these
are
depleted, Ca2+ cannot be pumped back due to a lack of ATP
and muscles become chronically contracted (Jeacocke, 1993).
Postmortem relaxation of muscle is also promoted by increased
Ca2+ levels, which induce degradation of muscle cell constitu-
ents by Ca2+ proteases (calpains) (Koohmaraie, 1992). It is
notable that both rigor mortis and necrosis are promoted by
increased Ca2+ levels that lead ultimately to proteolytic destruc-
tion of the cell.
Here we describe the occurrence of a rigor mortis-like process
in C. elegans. We report that a transient reduction in body length
occurs during death in young adult worms killed using lethal
stress and during death from old age. We show that such death
contraction is altered by manipulations of muscle function in a
manner consistent with the occurrence of rigor mortis during
C. elegans organismal death. Death contraction also precedes,
and is coupled with, intestinal necrosis. This suggests that an
organism-wide wave of Ca2+ release causes rigor mortis and
intestinal necrosis and is a major event driving organismal death
in C. elegans. We also find that death contraction is suppressed
in long-lived daf-2 insulin/IGF-1 receptor mutants, suggesting
possible organismal death resistance, and that this suppression
requires daf-18/PTEN, but not daf-16/FoxO.
RESULTS
Death in C. elegans Is Accompanied by an AP Wave of
Contraction
Animals dying from old age typically exhibit DF, marking intesti-
nal necrosis (Coburn et al., 2013), and also a transient reduction
in body size (Stroustrup et al., 2013). Since such necrosis and DF
also occur during stress-induced death in young adults, we
asked whether they also show the death-induced reduction in
body size. Changes in worm body length were captured and
converted into kymographs (single images displaying temporal
changes) (Nair et al., 2014; Zhou et al., 2001), from which data
were extracted with MATLAB and analyzed using R scripts
(Experimental Procedures).
Upon killing with an organic peroxide, tert-butylhydroperoxide
(tBOOH, 14%), young wild-type (N2) adults exhibited a transient
reduction in body length shortly after cessation of movement
(Figure 1A) that progressed in an AP wave (Figure 1B; Figure S1).
This reduction in body length was accompanied by a wave of DF
(Figure 1A; Movie S1). It was previously shown that nose muscle
contraction occurs in response to a number of drugs, including
fluoxetine (Prozac, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor)
(Choy and Thomas, 1999). However, this phenomenon is distinct
from the effect of tBOOH-induced killing: fluoxetine-induced
nose contraction was not accompanied by DF, and worms
were still alive 1 hr after treatment (Figure S2). We next killed
worms with thermal injury, induced using a thermoelectrically
heated microscope stage (PE120, Linkam Scientific). Again, a
transient reduction in body length was seen, which occurred at
a faster rate than in response to tBOOH (Figure 1A). However,
here AP progression was not detected in either the contraction
or the DF (data not shown).
We then examined worms dying as the result of aging. Here
again, a reduction in body length was seen, consistent with pre-
vious observations (Stroustrup et al., 2013). However, the magni-
tude of the contraction was smaller than in young adults, and it
was not seen in all animals (Figure 1D; Movie S2). These results
imply that the occurrence of transient body length reduction at
death is a typical feature of organismal death in C. elegans. For
convenience, we will refer to the death-associated reduction in
body length as death contraction (DC).
DC Is Caused by Muscle Contraction
Labeling of
body wall
muscles with fluorescent
myosin,
MYO-3::GFP, revealed a clear AP wave of muscle contraction
during death (Figure 1C; Movie S1), implying that DC is caused
by muscle contraction. To verify this, we tested the effect of
altering muscle function on DC and recovery. We first tested
whether DC was suppressed in mutants incapable of muscle
contraction due to a loss of structural components of the muscu-
lature, namely unc-15(e73) (paramyosin), unc-54(e190) (myosin
heavy chain), and unc-60(e723) (cofilin). All largely suppressed
DC after killing with tBOOH or with heat (Figure 2A).
Then we tested the prediction that DC should be reduced in
worms in which muscles are already hyper-contracted by using
levamisole, an acetylcholine agonist that binds to receptors in
the body wall muscle, causing hyper-contraction. Pre-treatment
with 1 mM levamisole shortened body length, and pre-treated
worms showed reduced DC (Figure 2B). DC was also reduced
in unc-22(e66) (twitchin) mutants, which, due to abnormal mus-
cle structure, are already hyper-contracted (Benian et al.,
1989) (Figure 2C).
Another characteristic of rigor mortis in mammals is that it be-
comes less marked with age, due to an age-related decline in
muscle function (Siegel et al., 2000). Given that senescent decline
of muscle (sarcopenia) also occurs in C. elegans (Herndon et al.,
2002), we tested the effect of aging on DC by examining the ef-
fects of tBOOH-induced death in adult worms at different ages.
This revealed a marked and progressive decline with increasing
age in the magnitude of DC (Figure 2D). Taken together, these
findings clearly imply that C. elegans DC is, like mammalian rigor
mortis, the result of muscle contraction occurring during death.

 Correlation between DC and DF Wave Patterns
The occurrence of DC could provide insight into other aspects of
C. elegans organismal death. Dying worms typically exhibit an
AP wave of intestinal fluorescence, marking an AP wave of intes-
tinal necrosis (Coburn et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2016a). It has
hitherto been unclear how this wave is initiated or how its AP
polarity specified. To investigate a possible link between the
AP waves of muscle contraction and intestinal necrosis, we
examined the correspondence between DC and DF waves dur-
ing tBOOH-induced death at different ages and during death
from old age.
Analysis of death in older worms revealed the occurrence of
additional forms of DC and DF wave. In addition to anterior-to-
posterior DC waves (DC AP), we also observed posterior-to-
anterior (DC PA) and simultaneous anterior and posterior

contraction (DC S). Similarly, there were
a variety of DF wave types in addition
to the anterior-to-posterior DF waves
(DF AP) seen in young adults: in old worms
we also saw posterior-to-anterior waves
(DF PA), waves originating in the mid-
body and propagating outward (DF M),
and complex waves with simultaneous
AP and PA components (DF AP + PA), or
where DF AP (or DF PA) and DF M
occurred within the same worm (DF AP
[or PA] + M).
While 96% of young adults exhibited
DC AP waves during tBOOH-induced
killing, this proportion decreased progres-
sively with age, while in those dying from
senescence, DC AP waves were detect-
able in only 50% of cases (Figure 3A). Meanwhile, DC S and
DC PA waves occurred more frequently in older tBOOH-killed
animals and during death from senescence (Figure 3A). Similarly,
89% of young adults killed with tBOOH showed DF AP waves,
decreasing to 46% in worms dying from old age, while the fre-
quency of DF PA, DF M, and complex waves increased with
age (Figure 3B; Figure S3A). These results imply that aging alters
the process of organismal death.
We also examined DC and DF in senescent worms cultured in
a custom automated vermiculture system (Zhang et al., 2016b).
For this we used the strain AQ2953 (described below) grown at
25�C and rendered sterile by pos-1 RNAi. Under these condi-
tions, DC was less pronounced, but contraction and DF at
the anterior or posterior end or both were detected (Figures
S4A–S4C).
2732
Cell Reports 22, 2730–2741, March 6, 2018
 In killed young adults, DC typically started immediately prior
to DF, while in older killed animals (days 8 and 12) or in those
dying from senescence, DC and DF often occurred simulta-
neously (Figure 3C). Moreover, in killed contraction-defective
unc-15, unc-54, and unc-60 mutants, the appearance of DF
was delayed, relative to both the time of exposure to tBOOH
(Figure 3D; Table S1) and the time of onset of DC (Figure S4D).
This not only suggests that DC triggers DF but also that DF
can occur in the absence of DC. Interestingly, the direction
of

and
DF
waves
was
strongly
correlated,
during
both tBOOH-induced death and senescence-induced death,
both on plates and in the automated system (Figure 3E; Fig-
ures S3B and S4C), implying that DC and DF waves are
coupled.
Overall, these results suggest that organismal death can
involve a two-step process (particularly in younger adults), in
which DC occurs first and then triggers DF. Here either the
orientation of the DC wave determines that of the DF wave or
there exists an underlying determinant of the orientation of
both waves. Supporting the latter interpretation, AP orientation
of DF was still present when DC was reduced using unc muta-
tions (Figure S4E).

 A Wave of Ca2+ Release in Body Wall Muscle during DC
The earlier onset of DC and the close correspondence between
the direction of DC and DF suggest that death could somehow
be transmitted from the body wall muscles to the intestine. Our
findings suggest two possible mechanisms by which intestinal
necrosis might be triggered: mechanical stress as the pharynx
is driven backward into the anterior intestine or effects of
elevated Ca2+ levels in the cytoplasm of muscle cells adjacent
to the anterior intestine.
The first possibility is that DC exerts mechanical stress upon
the anterior intestine. We noticed that, during organismal death,
hyper-contraction of longitudinal body wall muscles in the head
pushes the pharynx backward into the anterior intestine. Obser-
vation of dying young adult worms (n = 24) showed that, in all
cases, shortening of the head caused the pharynx to kink
(Figure 4A). Notably, the impact of pharynx with the anterior in-
testine coincided with the first appearance of DF near the point

(D) Blocking DC delays DF (**p < 0.01 and
****p < 0.0001, one-way ANOVA). This suggests
that DC promotes DF. An alternative possibility that
cannot be excluded is that the delay in DF is due to
reduced tBOOH ingestion rate, resulting from the
slightly reduced pharyngeal pumping rate in these
mutants (Figure S3C).

of impact (Figure 4A; Movie S3). Prior to
death, 13% of the posterior bulb diameter
was within the anterior intestine, but, at
the point of initiation of DF, this rose to
44% (mean value) (Figure 4B). This sug-
gests that mechanical stress could trigger
the wave of intestinal necrosis in a belly
punch-type effect. An analysis of the rela-
tionship between extent of pharyngeal
invagination and the timing of first appear-
ance of DF supports this idea (Figure 4B).
Pharyngeal invagination could act alone
or
in
combination
with
pressure
on
the gut caused by body wall muscle
contraction.
Another possibility is that coupling of
the DC and DF waves is mediated by a
Ca2+ signal. In mammals, rigor mortis is
triggered by a sudden increase in intracel-
lular Ca2+ concentration as ATP-dependent Ca2+ pumps in the
SR are no longer maintained (Jeacocke, 1993). To explore
whether a similar mechanism might cause DC in C. elegans,
we monitored Ca2+ release from the SR of body wall muscle at
death using the strain AQ2953, which expresses the fluorescent
Ca2+ sensor GCaMP3 (Butler et al., 2015; Schwarz et al., 2012).
Induction of death in young adults (tBOOH) caused a large in-
crease in cytoplasmic Ca2+ in body wall muscle (Figure 4C),
which occurred in an AP wave that coincided with DC (Figures
4D and 4E; Movie S4). Furthermore, in all worms tested
(n = 15), the AP intramuscular Ca2+ wave preceded the DF
wave (Figures 4D and 4E; Movie S4).
We also examined body wall muscle Ca2+ in animals dying of
old age in an automated vermiculture system. Here again, Ca2+
release typically occurred simultaneously with DC but preceded
DF (Figure S4F). In this case, the frequency of AP and PA Ca2+
waves was similar (Figure S4G) and both usually co-located
2734
Cell Reports 22, 2730–2741, March 6, 2018
 with DC, though in some cases Ca2+ waves occurred without
detectable DC (Figures S4F and S4H).
Thus, during C. elegans organismal death, as in mammalian
rigor mortis, DC of muscle is accompanied by Ca2+ release
into muscle cytoplasm. This intramuscular Ca2+ wave pre-
cedes the DF wave, which itself is accompanied by a wave
of Ca2+ influx in the intestine (Coburn et al., 2013). Our results
imply that the two Ca2+ waves are coupled, and they suggest
that the Ca2+ muscle wave might trigger the intestinal Ca2+
wave.
A Wave of ATP Depletion during DC
Mammalian rigor mortis is triggered by ATP depletion (Bate-
Smith and Bendall, 1947; Kawai and Brandt, 1976). To test

whether DC is accompanied by ATP
depletion, we constructed a transgenic
C. elegans strain with a fluorescent re-
porter of ATP levels, Queen-2m (Yagi-
numa et al., 2014), expressed in body
wall muscle using the myo-3 promoter.
This
sensor,
not
previously
used
in
C. elegans, is composed of circularly
permuted
EGFP
(cpEGFP)
inserted
between 2 a helices of the bacterial
FoF1-ATP synthase ε subunit, and it acts
as a ratiometric probe where the ATP level
is proportional to the 402/482 excitation
ratio.
This
strain
showed
a
reduced
402/482 excitation ratio upon starvation
or treatment with phenoxy-2-propanol,
sodium azide, or oligomycin, in each
case consistent with the expected reduction in ATP levels
(Figure 5A), thus validating Queen-2m as an ATP sensor in
C. elegans.
In young adults, tBOOH-induced killing resulted in a wave of
ATP depletion, which included a major AP component (Figures
5B and 5C; Movie S5). Moreover, the onset of DC in the head
coincided with a 402/482 excitation decrease of 32% (mean)
(Figure 5D) and preceded DF (p < 0.0001, paired t test). The
simultaneous occurrence of DC and declining ATP is consistent
with rigor mortis. However, it remains unclear whether the rapid
decline in ATP in muscle during organismal death causes DC.
C. elegans in liquid culture shows an age-related decline in
ATP content (Braeckman et al., 1999), suggesting that a senes-
cent decline in ATP might eventually trigger DC and organismal

 death. To test this, we first measured ATP content per worm at
different ages in plate-cultured animals using a biochemical
assay. Here, in contrast to liquid-cultured animals, ATP content
remained relatively constant for much of adult life (Figure 5E).
Thus, C. elegans is capable of maintaining ATP levels up to an
advanced age.
Aging C. elegans may be classified on the basis of level of
motility, where class A animals move normally, class B animals
show reduced movement but are capable of crawling if prod-
ded, and class C animals barely move (Herndon et al., 2002).
Class C worms
are near death
and usually
die within
1–3 days. Comparison of ATP content in class A, B, and C
worms showed a modest decline in class B but a major decline
in class C (Figure 5F), likely reflecting the presence of severe,
terminal pathology and incipient organismal death. Thus, in
plate-cultured C. elegans, declining ATP level is apparently

more a function of terminal pathology
and organismal death than of senes-
cence more broadly.
Insulin/IGF-1 Signaling Promotes DC
Reduced insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS) in-
creases lifespan in C. elegans via proxi-
mate mechanisms that remain unclear
(Kenyon, 2010) but likely entail slower
development of the senescent pathol-
ogies that cause death. However, the
existence of a definable process of organ-
ismal death suggests an additional possi-
bility: that in IIS mutants a given level of senescent pathology is
less likely to trigger organismal death, i.e., they are to some de-
gree death resistant. Consistent with this, mutation of the daf-2
insulin/IGF-1 receptor reduces DF (Coburn et al., 2013), and
shrinking during death in senescent worms is suppressed by
daf-2 RNAi (Stroustrup et al., 2013). Exploring this further, we
found that daf-2(e1370) reduced the magnitude of DC in young
adults, after killing with either tBOOH or heat (Figure 6A;
Figure S5A).
All daf-2 mutant alleles can cause increased longevity, but
some (such as e1370) show multiple pleiotropic effects that
can be dissociated from effects on lifespan (Gems et al., 1998).
We therefore compared DC resistance in two non-pleiotropic
(class 1) alleles, e1368 (weaker) and m41 (stronger), and two
pleiotropic (class 2) mutants, e1370 and m579 (similar severity)
(20�C), and we observed DC resistance in all but e1368
2736
Cell Reports 22, 2730–2741, March 6, 2018
 (Figure 6B). The DC resistance of daf-2(m41) shows that this is
not a class 2-specific pleiotropic trait. That e1370 increases
lifespan more than e1368 (20�C) (Podshivalova et al., 2017)
supports a possible role of DC resistance in daf-2 longevity.
daf-2 mutant longevity requires the DAF-16 FoxO transcription
factor (Kenyon, 2010). Surprisingly, reduction of DC in the daf-2
mutant was largely daf-16 independent (Figure 6A). This, how-
ever, does not rule out the contribution of possible death resis-
tance to increased daf-2 longevity (i.e., daf-16 may be necessary

for daf-2 death resistance to increase life-
span). Other downstream mediators of
daf-2 effects on lifespan include the
SKN-1/Nrf2 transcription factor, which
activates expression of the antioxidant
enzymes of the biotransformation system
(Tullet et al., 2008), and the PQM-1 tran-
scription factor (Tepper et al., 2013). How-
ever, neither are required for daf-2 DC
resistance (Figure 6C). Mutation of daf-2
increases DAF-16, SKN-1, and PQM-1
activity by reducing levels of phosphati-
dylinositol
(3,4,5)-trisphosphate
(PIP3),
and this effect is counteracted by muta-
tion of the PIP3 phosphatase DAF-18
(PTEN) (Mihaylova et al., 1999). Notably,
daf-2(e1370) DC resistance was largely
abrogated by daf-18(nr2037) (Figure 6C),
implying that PIP3 promotes organismal
death
via
another
effector
pathway
(Figure 6D).
A further possibility is that daf-2(e1370)
promotes DC resistance by maintaining
ATP levels in stressful conditions. Consis-
tent with this, daf-2 caused a delay in the
decline in muscle ATP during tBOOH-
induced death (compare Figure 5B and
Figure S5B); however, this delay may
also be attributable to slower tBOOH uptake or increased detox-
ification (see below). It was previously noted that daf-2(e1370)
increases overall ATP content in C. elegans (Houthoofd et al.,
2005). However, ATP levels in muscle in young daf-2 adults
were not increased (Figure S5C).
daf-2(e1370) also caused a significant delay in the onset of
both DC and DF after tBOOH exposure (Figures 6E and 6F; Table
S1). This is consistent with the known daf-2 mutant resistance to
tBOOH (Tullet et al., 2008). It is unclear how reduced IIS
Cell Reports 22, 2730–2741, March 6, 2018
2737
 suppresses DC and DF, but daf-2 did not detectably reduce the
magnitude of the death-associated increase in sarcoplasmic
Ca2+ (Figure S5D). Whether DC resistance contributes to daf-2
longevity remains to be demonstrated.
Evidence that Ca2+-Dependent Osmotic Effects
Promote Recovery from DC
As in mammalian rigor mortis, DC in C. elegans is followed by re-
covery, where the body and muscle sarcomeres regain their
initial length (Figure 1A; Movie S1). In mammals, recovery is pro-
moted by muscle proteolysis caused by Ca2+-dependent prote-
ases (calpains) (Geesink et al., 2006; Huff Lonergan et al., 2010;
Kent et al., 2004), although this has little effect on the migration
properties of myosins on SDS-PAGE (Huff Lonergan et al.,
2010); similarly, we saw no signs of myosin degradation during
recovery in tBOOH-induced death (Figure S6A). To probe
whether recovery from DC in C. elegans is mediated by cal-
pain-mediated proteolysis, we tested for the effects of overex-
pression or deletion of clp-1, the major muscle calpain in
C. elegans (Joyce et al., 2012), but none was detected (Fig-
ure S6B). Possibly other muscle-expressed proteases promote
recovery from DC.
Both rigor mortis and recovery from it are promoted by Ca2+
and, therefore, chelation of Ca2+ is predicted to inhibit both.
Ca2+ chelation with EGTA inhibits rigor mortis in vertebrate mus-
cle (Feinstein, 1966; Weiner and Pearson, 1969). We observed
that EGTA (400 mM) increased rather than decreased tBOOH-
induced DC, but it suppressed recovery (Figure S6C). By
contrast, an iso-osmotic solution of NaCl (660 mM) did not sup-
press recovery, arguing against a non-specific osmotic effect of
EGTA. However, 660 mM NaCl did partially suppress recovery
after death from heat stress (Figure S6D). We also tested
whether EGTA reduces sarcoplasmic Ca2+ levels during DC,
but, against expectation, it did not (Figure S6E). This implies
that the suppression of recovery by EGTA is not due to reduced
Ca2+-dependent processes in muscle. Overall, these results
suggest that a Ca2+-dependent osmotic effect contributes to
the recovery from DC (discussed further below).
DISCUSSION
The process of organismal death and how it is triggered by aging
arenotwell understoodin mammals andbarelyat allin C.elegans.
Three major mysteries relating to death from old age are as
follows: how senescence generates pathologies that cause
death, how these pathologies trigger death, and the mechanisms
of organismal death itself (Figure 7A). This study yields insights
into the two latter issues, implicating Ca2+ release and ATP deple-
tion as triggers of organismal death and suggesting a process in
which coupled waves of rigor mortis and fluorescence-marked
intestinal necrosis are propagated along the organism, in a
terminal process of cellular destruction (Figure 7B; Figure S7).
A Rigor Mortis-like Process Occurs during Organismal
Death in C. elegans
We previously demonstrated that, in dying C. elegans, there is a
wave of intestinal necrosis accompanied by DF (Coburn et al.,
2013). Findings presented here show that organismal death in
C. elegans includes events similar to mammalian rigor mortis.
Both involve muscle hyper-contraction at death, accompanied
by reduced ATP and increased Ca2+; both are followed by recov-
ery from hyper-contraction; and both show a decline in magni-
tude with increasing age as the result of sarcopenia. However,
there are also some differences. First, in mammals, rigor mortis
occurs some time after the main events in organismal death
(cessation of heart function and brain death), whereas in
C. elegans it occurs earlier. This may reflect the fact that, in mam-
mals, anoxia resulting from the loss of circulation promotes
organismal death, whereas C. elegans does not possess a
vascular system due to its small size and, therefore, anoxia is
not expected to play a role in their death; hence rigor mortis is
a relatively early event during death (Figure S7). Second, in mam-
mals, recovery from rigor mortis is promoted by muscle

 proteolysis, whereas we were unable to detect a role of proteol-
ysis in recovery from DC in C. elegans; instead, our results
suggest that recovery from DC is a Ca2+-dependent osmotic ef-
fect (see below for further discussion).
DC and Intestinal Necrosis Are Coupled
Findings presented here show that DC is coupled with and
slightly precedes DF. This suggests that DC can trigger the intes-
tinal necrosis that generates DF, i.e., that death can spread from
the musculature to the intestine. Rigor mortis and necrosis are
similar processes, involving transmembrane gradient collapse
and Ca2+ influx into the cytoplasm that promotes proteolytic
(e.g., calpain-mediated) destruction (Koohmaraie, 1992; Yama-
shima and Oikawa, 2009); consistent with this, DC and DF are
both accompanied by a Ca2+ wave.
In AP DC waves, the muscle Ca2+ wave first approaches the
intestine at its anterior end. One possibility is that a Ca2+ leak
from dying muscle cells onto anterior intestinal cells triggers
the AP DF wave, i.e., the Ca2+ wave jumps from the body wall
muscle (or possibly pharyngeal muscle) to the intestine (Figures
4E and 7B). An additional potential trigger is the pharyngeal-
intestinal collision caused by head muscle hyper-contraction
(Figures 4A and 4B).
The coupling of DC and intestinal necrosis suggests a link be-
tweenthebiologyoforganismaldeathandthatofdefecation.Dur-
ing the latter, peristalsis is affected by a PA intestinal Ca2+ wave
(Peters et al., 2007) that is coupled to muscle contraction by pro-
ton release (Beg et al., 2008). Overall, these results support a
model of C. elegans organismal death in which a Ca2+-triggered
wave of terminal muscle contraction triggers a second, coupled
wave of intestinal necrosis, in a process that in some respects re-
sembles a distorted and destructive defecation cycle.
Osmotic Swelling as a Possible Driver of Recovery
from DC
The apparent differences between vertebrates and C. elegans in
the mechanisms of recovery from DC may in part reflect differ-
ences in size and anatomy. For example, in vertebrates,
muscular elongation during recovery from rigor mortis is
powered by tension transmitted from muscle hyper-contraction
to ligaments and bones. Proteolytic degradation of muscle al-
lows this elongation to occur. Although C. elegans has no bones,
it does possess a hydrostatic skeleton and exoskeleton (cuticle)
against which muscles work (Karbowski et al., 2006). C. elegans
corpses when handled appear limp and floppy, suggesting that
the hydrostatic skeleton collapses during organismal death.
Moreover,
worm
pick-handling
observations
suggest
that
worms during the throes of DC do not develop rigidity (data
not shown). In the absence of the hydrostatic skeleton, it is not
clear what drives the elongation of the worm during recovery.
One possibility is that recovery is driven by the effect of os-
motic swelling in the intestine, occurring as the result of intestinal
necrosis, or osmotic swelling more generally throughout the
worm. That EGTA, but not an iso-osmotic concentration of
NaCl, suppresses recovery could imply that Ca2+-dependent
intestinal necrosis leads to osmotic swelling, which promotes re-
covery. Whether proteolysis of muscle plays a permissive role in
recovery from DC warrants further investigation.
Defining Senescent Death and Its Origins
It is difficult to define exactly when cells and organisms become
inexorably committed to the process of death. One view is that
the point of no return is the inability to maintain transmembrane
gradients and, particularly, those that control Ca2+ levels (Orre-
nius et al., 2003).
Maintenance of transmembrane gradients requires ATP, but
our findings did not support the simple model that gradual
age-related decline in metabolic capacity leads to ATP depletion
and, consequently, death. Instead, ATP levels are well main-
tained into late life, beyond the age at which many major senes-
cent pathologies appear (Ezcurra et al., 2017). By contrast,
during organismal death caused by tBOOH or senescence
(class C animals that include the dying), ATP levels drop dramat-
ically. One possibility is that this reflects the loss of regulation of
ATP production or, more likely, of consumption in dying cells.
The end-of-life crash in ATP level could be a trigger and/or a
consequence of terminal necrosis in muscle and intestine; this
warrants further investigation.
Crashes in ATP level during organismal death have also been
described in mammals. For example, in one study of death in
dogs, ATP levels in the cerebral cortex dropped by �70% within
5 min of cessation of movement (Sarkisian and Adamian, 1970).
Moreover, it is well documented that ATP decline and sub-
sequent Ca2+ overload mediate the necrotic cell death and
excitotoxicity-induced cell death that accompanies stroke and
Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases (Gorman, 2008). Thus,
studies of pathology, ATP, Ca2+ signaling, and organismal death
in C. elegans may provide insights into these fundamental mech-
anisms of pathophysiology.
Conclusions
In this study, we have documented a phenomenon that is part of
the process of organismal death in C. elegans, accompanying in-
testinal necrosis (and death fluorescence): DC, which is driven by
muscle hyper-contraction and shares features with mammalian
rigor mortis. DC is accompanied by a decline in ATP levels and
increased Ca2+, and it is coupled to intestinal necrosis, which it
often precedes and, potentially, triggers, in what resembles a dis-
torted and destructive defecation cycle. These findings show
how C. elegans can be used as a model to understand conserved
mechanisms of organismal death, and they raise questions such
as what are the pathologies that trigger organismal death and
how do they do so and is resistance/susceptibility to organismal
death a determinant of C. elegans lifespan?

DC Assays
For tBOOH-induced death, animals were placed in a drop of 14% tBOOH and
observed using time-lapse photography. For heat-induced death, animals
were placed onto a thermoelectrically heated microscope stage (PE120,
Linkam Scientific) and heated to 52.5�C. Images were captured every 30 s
for 2 hr for tBOOH-induced death and every 2.5 s for 2 min for heat-induced
death. Changes in worm body length were analyzed by converting multiple im-
ages into kymographs, which were then analyzed using a MATLAB script
(MathWorks) (Data S1; for additional details, see the Supplemental Experi-
mental Procedures).
Time-lapse photography was also performed on animals dying of old age.
Barely mobile N2 animals at an advanced stage of senescence (late class C)
(Coburn et al., 2013) were picked, and images were taken every 15 min for
4–20 hr as the worms expired. We also assessed DC, DF, and Ca2+ increases
during death from old age in the strain AQ2953 expressing GCaMP3 in body
wall muscles. AQ2953 worms were grown at 25�C with pos-1 RNAi in a custom
automated vermiculture system (Zhang et al., 2016b), and images were
captured every 15 min over a 6-day period in late life, during which the majority
of animals died of old age. Assessment of presence and orientation of DC,
Ca2+, and DF waves was performed manually and independently by two
people; for additional details, see the Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Calcium Imaging
For Ca2+ imaging, the strain AQ2953 was used, which expresses GCaMP3
together with TagRFP in body wall muscles. DF was observed using a DAPI fil-
ter cube, GCaMP3 with a GFP filter cube, and TagRFP with a Rhodamine filter
cube. In each worm, the GCaMP3/TagRFP ratio for a randomly selected region
of head muscle was measured prior to death and at its subsequent maximal
level. GCaMP3/TagRFP induction was then calculated as a ratio of
GCaMP3/TagRFPMax and GCaMP3/TagRFPInitial.
ATP Measurements
To assay age changes in ATP content per worm, a CellTiter-Glo Luminescent
Cell Viability Assay (Promega) was used with N2 worms of a range of ages
(5 worms per assay) and in worms of different motility classes (A, B, and C)
(1 worm per assay, n = 10 per trial). For estimates of relative ATP levels using
the Queen-2m sensor, lex of 402/15 nm or 482/28 nm and lem of 545/25 was
measured and 402/482 excitation ratio calculated, as described (Yaginuma
et al., 2014); for additional details, see the Supplemental Experimental
Procedures.
Statistical Analysis
Data mean values are presented ± SEM. For tests of statistical significance, a
one-way or two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s honest significant difference (HSD)
correction or a two-tailed t test was performed.
