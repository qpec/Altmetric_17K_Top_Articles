The proportion of US food that is imported is increasing; 
most seafood and half of fruits are imported. We identified 
a small but increasing number of foodborne disease out-
breaks associated with imported foods, most commonly fish 
and produce. New outbreak investigation tools and federal 
regulatory authority are key to maintaining food safety.
A
pproximately 19% of food consumed in the United 
States is imported, including ≈97% of fish and shell-
fish, ≈50% of fresh fruits, and ≈20% of fresh vegetables 
(1). The proportion of food that is imported has increased 
steadily over the past 20 years because of changing con-
sumer demand for a wider selection of food products and 
increasing demand for produce items year round (1).
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 
defines a foodborne disease outbreak as the occurrence of 
>2 persons with a similar illness resulting from ingestion 
of a common food (2). Local, state, and territorial health 
departments report foodborne disease outbreaks to CDC 
through the Foodborne Disease Outbreak Surveillance Sys-
tem. The information collected for each outbreak includes 
etiology (confirmed or suspected on the basis of predefined 
criteria) (2), year, month, state, implicated food, and num-
ber of illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths. Information is 
also collected on where implicated food originated. During 
1973–1997, this information was reported anecdotally in the 
report’s comments section. During 1998–2008, “contami-
nated food imported into U.S.” was included as a location 
where food was prepared. Since 2009, the form has included 
a variable to indicate whether an implicated food was im-
ported into the United States and the country of origin.
The Study
We reviewed outbreak reports to identify outbreaks as-
sociated with an imported food from the inception of 
the surveillance system in 1973 through 2014, the most 
recent year for which data were available. We obtained 
 
additional data for some outbreaks (e.g., country of origin) 
 
from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and 
the US Department of Agriculture Food Safety and In-
spection Service.
We categorized implicated foods by using the schema 
developed by the Interagency Food Safety Analytics Col-
laboration (3). We grouped countries using the United Na-
tions Statistics Division classification (4). We conducted a 
descriptive analysis of the number of outbreaks over time, 
by food category, and by region of origin.
During 1996–2014, a total of 195 outbreak investiga-
tions implicated an imported food, resulting in 10,685 ill-
nesses, 1,017 hospitalizations, and 19 deaths. Outbreaks 
associated with imported foods represented an increasing 
proportion of all foodborne disease outbreaks where a food 
was implicated and reported (1% during 1996–2000 vs. 5% 
during 2009–2014). The number of outbreaks associated 
with an imported food increased from an average of 3 per 
year during 1996–2000 to an average of 18 per year during 
2009–2014 (Figure).
The most common agents reported in outbreaks asso-
ciated with imported foods were scombroid toxin and Sal-
monella; most illnesses were associated with Salmonella 
and Cyclospora (Table). Aquatic animals were responsible 
for 55% of outbreaks and 11% of outbreak-associated ill-
nesses. Produce was responsible for 33% of outbreaks and 
84% of outbreak-associated illnesses. Outbreaks attributed 
to produce had a median of 40 illnesses compared with a 
median of 3 in outbreaks attributed to aquatic animals. All 
but 1 of the outbreaks caused by scombroid toxin was as-
sociated with fish. Most of the Salmonella outbreaks (77%) 
were associated with produce, including fruits (n = 14), 
seeded vegetables (n = 10), sprouts (n = 6), nuts and seeds 
(n = 5), spices (n = 4), and herbs (n = 1).
Information was available on the region of origin for 
177 (91%) outbreaks. Latin America and the Caribbean 
was the most common region implicated, followed by Asia 
(online Technical Appendix, https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/
article/23/3/16-1462-Techapp1.xlsx). Thirty-one countries 
were implicated; Mexico was most frequently implicated 
(42 outbreaks). Other countries associated with >10 out-
breaks were Indonesia (n = 17) and Canada (n = 11). Fish 
and shellfish originated from all regions except Europe but

were most commonly imported from Asia (65% of out-
breaks associated with fish or shellfish). Produce originated 
from all regions but was most commonly imported from 
Latin America and the Caribbean (64% of outbreaks as-
sociated with produce). All but 1 outbreak associated with 
dairy products involved products imported from Latin 
America and the Caribbean.
Outbreaks in this analysis were reported from 31 
states, most commonly California (n = 30), Florida (n = 
25), and New York (n = 16). Forty-three outbreaks (22%) 
were multistate outbreaks.
Conclusions
The number of reported outbreaks associated with imported 
foods, although small, has increased as an absolute number 
and in proportion to the total number of outbreaks in which 
the implicated food was identified and reported. Although 
many types of imported foods were associated with out-
breaks, fish and produce were most common. These findings 
are consistent with overall trends in food importation (5).
Many outbreaks, particularly outbreaks involving pro-
duce, were associated with foods imported from countries 
in Latin America and the Caribbean. Because of their prox-
imity, these countries are major sources of perishable items 
such as fresh fruits and vegetables; Mexico is the source of 
about one quarter of the total value of fruit and nut imports 
and 45%–50% of vegetable imports, followed by Chile 
and Costa Rica. Similarly, our finding that many outbreaks 
were associated with fish from Asia is consistent with data 
on the sources of fish imports (6).
One quarter of the outbreaks were multistate, reflecting 
the wide distribution of many imported foods. Systems like 
PulseNet have helped to improve detection and investiga-
tion of multistate outbreaks, resulting in an increased num-
ber of multistate outbreaks (7,8). The increasing number of 
outbreaks involving globally distributed foods underscores 
the need to strengthen regional and global networks for out-
break detection and information sharing. The importance 
of having standard protocols for molecular characteriza-
tion of isolates and systems for rapid traceability of im-
plicated foods to their source was illustrated during the in-
vestigation of a listeriosis outbreak linked to Italian cheese 
imported into the United States in 2012 (9). Newer tools 
like whole genome sequencing can also help to generate

changed over time; 1973–1997, 
imported foods anecdotally noted 
in report comments; 1998–2008, 
“contaminated food imported 
into U.S.” included as a location 
where food was prepared; 2009–
2014, reporting jurisdictions could 
indicate whether each food is 
imported (yes/no) and the country 
of origin.
 Outbreaks and Food Imported into the United States
hypothetical transmission networks and in some instances 
facilitate traceback of foods to their origin (10). Moreover, 
new tools that aid visualization of supplier networks facili-
tate the investigation of outbreaks involving the increas-
ingly complex global economy (11).
Nearly all of the outbreaks involved foods under FDA 
jurisdiction. Only a small proportion of FDA-regulated 
foods are inspected upon entry into the United States. New 
rules under the Food Safety Modernization Act of 2011, 
including the Preventive Controls Rule for Human Food, 
Produce Safety Rule, Foreign Supplier Verification Pro-
gram, and Accreditation of Third Party Auditors, will help 
to strengthen the safety of imported foods by granting FDA 
enhanced authorities to require that imported foods meet the 
same safety standards as foods produced domestically (12).
Although data collection has improved in recent years, 
these findings might underestimate the number of out-
breaks associated with imported foods because the origin 
of only a small proportion of foods causing outbreaks is 
reported. Similarly, because of how data are collected and 
reported, the relative safety of imported and domestically 
produced foods cannot be compared. Because of changes 
in surveillance and changing import patterns, changes over 
time should be interpreted cautiously.
Our findings reflect current patterns in food imports 
and provide information to help guide future outbreak 
investigations. Prevention focused on the most common 
imported foods causing outbreaks, produce and seafood, 
could help prevent outbreaks. Efforts to improve the safety 
of the food supply can include strengthening reporting by 
gathering better data on the origin of implicated food items, 
including whether imported and from what country.
