During spermatogenesis, a large number of germline genes essential for male fertility are coordinately activated.
However, it remains unknown how timely activation of this group of germline genes is accomplished. Here we show
that Polycomb-repressive complex 1 (PRC1) directs timely activation of germline genes during spermatogenesis.
Inactivation of PRC1 in male germ cells results in the gradual loss of a stem cell population and severe differentiation
defects, leading to male infertility. In the stem cell population, RNF2, the dominant catalytic subunit of PRC1,
activates transcription of Sall4, which codes for a transcription factor essential for subsequent spermatogenic dif-
ferentiation. Furthermore, RNF2 and SALL4 together occupy transcription start sites of germline genes in the stem
cell population. Once differentiation commences, these germline genes are activated to enable the progression of
spermatogenesis. Our study identifies a novel mechanism by which Polycomb directs the developmental process by
activating a group of lineage-specific genes.

Timely activation of spermatogenesis-specific genes is es-
sential for male fertility (Kimmins and Sassone-Corsi
2005). During spermatogenesis, spermatogonial stem
cells, which are capable of self-renewal, develop into dif-
ferentiating spermatogonia, enter meiosis, and undergo
further differentiation into haploid sperm (Fig. 1A; Gris-
wold 2016). The gene expression program of male germ
cells is largely distinct from those of somatic lineages,
and a large number of germline genes are activated specif-
ically during spermatogenesis (Hasegawa et al. 2015; Sin
et al. 2015). Although regulation of gene expression is fun-
damental for spermatogenesis, the underlying mecha-
nism that directs the coordinated activation of germline
genes is largely unexplored.
Polycomb proteins regulate heritable gene silencing and
are responsible for stem cell renewal and development
(Aloia et al. 2013; Simon and Kingston 2013). Polycomb-
based heritable silencing safeguards cell type-specific
gene expression by suppressing non-lineage-specific gene
expression, thereby defining cellular identity (Geisler
and Paro 2015). One of the Polycomb complexes in mam-
mals, Polycomb-repressive complex 1 (PRC1), is a major
modifier of histone H2A through monoubiquitination of
Lys119 (H2AK119ub), a modification usually—but not al-
ways—associated with gene repression (Illingworth et al.
2015; Pengelly et al. 2015). During germ cell development,
PRC1 coordinates timing of sexual differentiation in fe-
male primordial germ cells (Yokobayashi et al. 2013) and
establishes developmental competence of oocytes for
the following generation by silencing genes that induce
somatic differentiation (Posfai et al. 2012). However, the
function of PRC1 in spermatogenesis remains unknown.
To test the function of PRC1 in spermatogenesis, in
this study, we generated a loss-of-function mouse model
of RNF2 (also known as RING1B), a component in the het-
erodimeric E3 ubiquitin ligases of PRC1 (Simon and
Kingston 2013). In the germline stem (GS) cell population,
we demonstrate that RNF2 activates the transcription of

 Sall4, which codes for a transcription factor essential for
subsequent spermatogenic differentiation (Hobbs et al.
2012). Furthermore, RNF2 and SALL4 together occupy
the transcription start sites (TSSs) of a variety of germline
genes in the stem cell population. Once differentiation
commences, the occupied germline genes are activated.
Our study identifies a novel epigenetic mechanism by
which PRC1 directs the timely activation of germline
genes during spermatogenesis.
Results
PRC1 is required for the maintenance of undifferentiated
spermatogonia and for spermatogenic differentiation
In postnatal male germ cells, RNF2 is abundantly ex-
pressed in PLZF+ undifferentiated spermatogonia, which
includes a subpopulation of self-renewing spermatogonial
stem cells, and in c-Kit+ differentiating spermatogonia,
which undergo committed differentiation and mitotic pro-
liferation (Supplemental Fig. S1; Hasegawa et al. 2015). Al-
though RNF2 appears to be the most active component in
the heterodimeric E3 ligases of PRC1, the RNF2 paralog
RING1 (also known as RING1A) can partially compensate
for the loss of RNF2 (Endoh et al. 2012). Ring1 knockout
mice are viable and do not have fertility defects (del Mar
Lorente et al. 2000), but Rnf2 knockout mice are embryon-
ic-lethal (Voncken et al. 2003). Thus, to determine the
global functions of PRC1 in spermatogenesis, we pursued
a genetic strategy to eliminate PRC1’s catalytic activity
for histone H2AK119 ubiquitination: We generated a con-
ditional deletion of Rnf2 (Rnf2 conditional knockout
[cKO]) with Ddx4-Cre, which is expressed specifically in
germ cells after embryonic day 14 (Gallardo et al. 2007),
on a Ring1 knockout background (Ddx4-Cre; Rnf2cKO;
Ring1 knockout). We refer to this mouse line as the
PRC1cKO. The phenotype was compared with littermate
controls that harbored floxed alleles for Rnf2 on a Ring1
knockout background without Ddx4-Cre (termed PRC1
control [PRC1ctrl]). This mouse model enabled us to
define the function of RNF2 without compensation from
RING1 while also representing a “complete” loss of func-
tion of PRC1 as shown in other biological contexts (Endoh
et al. 2012; Posfai et al. 2012; Yokobayashi et al. 2013).
PRC1cKO males were infertile and had small testes
(Supplemental Fig. S2A–C). We confirmed a near-com-
plete rate of Ddx4-Cre-mediated recombination by ob-
serving the depletion of H2AK119ub, a readout of PRC1
activity, in GCNA (a germ cell marker)+ germ cells of
PRC1cKO testes at postnatal day 7 (P7) and at 6 wk; con-
firming the germline-specific nature of the conditional
deletion,
H2AK119ub
deposition
was
preserved
in
somatic cells of PRC1cKO testes (Supplemental Fig.
S2D–F). Furthermore, PRC1cKO males showed smaller
testicular tubules at 6 wk, suggesting germ cell depletion
in the PRC1cKO (Supplemental Fig. S2G,H).
To determine the function of PRC1 in spermatogenesis,
we sought to identify and investigate the stages of sperma-
togenesis affected by the loss of PRC1. In the PRC1cKO,
the proportion of PLZF+ undifferentiated spermatogonia
was comparable with that of the PRC1ctrl at P2
but slowly decreased over a period of 6 wk (Fig. 1B), sug-
gesting that PRC1 is requiredfor the maintenance of undif-
ferentiated spermatogonia. Furthermore, γH2AX+ meiotic
cells, which represent early stages of meiotic prophase,
such as the leptotene and zygotene stages, were greatly di-
minished in the PRC1cKO at 6 wks of age (Fig. 1C), sug-
gesting that a large population of germ cells undergoes
progressive depletion prior to entry into meiotic prophase.
Therefore, we conclude that PRC1 loss of function leads to
germ cell depletion prior to meiosis. γH2AX+ meiotic cells
of the PRC1cKO did not exhibit XY bodies (Fig. 1C, inset),
which represent transcriptionally silent sex chromosomes
during meiotic prophase; additionally, histone variant
H1T, a marker of mid-pachytene spermatocytes, was not
detected (Supplemental Fig. S2I). These results indicate
that PRC1cKO spermatocytes cannot progress into the
mid-pachytene stage. Therefore, PRC1 is required not
only for the maintenance of undifferentiated spermatogo-
nia but also for spermatogenic differentiation.
To determine the cause of germ cell depletion in the
PRC1cKO, we analyzed germ cells for the occurrence of
apoptosis. We found that the frequency of tubules contain-
ing apoptotic cells in the PRC1cKO, as judged by immu-
nostaining of cleaved Caspase-3, was significantly higher
than that of the PRC1ctrl at P7 (Supplemental Fig. S3A).

 was higher among cleaved Caspase-3+ cells of the
PRC1cKO versus the PRC1ctrl (Supplemental Fig. S3B),
suggesting that the loss of PRC1 causes apoptosis in undif-
ferentiated spermatogonia. We next examined whether
the cell cycle is altered in spermatogonia of the PRC1cKO.
By immunostaining against Ki67, a marker of cell prolifer-
ation, and Histone H3 phosphorylated at Ser10 (phospho-
Histone H3), a marker of the M phase of the cell cycle,
we observed that the populations of Ki67+ and phospho-
Histone H3+ germ cells in the PRC1cKO testes were nor-
mal (Supplemental Fig. S3C,D). These data exclude the
possibility that germ cell depletion in the PRC1cKO is
due to cell cycle arrest at a particular cell cycle stage, sup-
porting our assertion that increased apoptosis of spermato-
gonia is a cause of germ cell depletion in the PRC1cKO.
PRC1 is required for the timely activation of germline
genes in spermatogenesis
To investigate gene expression changes underlying the
spermatogenic defects caused by PRC1 inactivation,
we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) using Thy1+
undifferentiated spermatogonia and c-Kit+ differentiating
spermatogonia purified from P7 testes by magnetic-
activated cell sorting (MACS). Our RNA-seq data de-
monstrate that 69 genes were up-regulated in Thy1+
spermatogonia of the PRC1cKO as compared with litter-
mate controls, while we observed a more extensive up-
regulation of 269 genes after differentiation into c-Kit+
spermatogonia in the PRC1cKO (Fig. 2A). Gene ontology
(GO) analysis revealed that up-regulated genes were en-
riched for those that function in cell adhesion, the mor-
phogenesis of epithelial and endothelial tubes, and
programmed cell death (Supplemental Fig. 4A,B). These
broad functions are not directly related to spermatogene-
sis, since they are suppressed in normal spermatogenesis.
Thus, these results suggest that PRC1 suppresses the ex-
pression of non-lineage-specific genes.
Notably, we observed that 116 genes were down-regu-
lated in Thy1+ spermatogonia, and the down-regulation
became more extensive in c-Kit+ spermatogonia of the
PRC1cKO, with decreased expression of 1381 genes (Fig.
2A). Many of the genes down-regulated in Thy1+ cells
were also consistently down-regulated in c-Kit+ cells (78
out of 116 genes) (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, the lowest P-val-
ue for down-regulation in both gene sets was Sall4, a gene
that encodes a transcription factor essential for spermato-
genic differentiation (Fig. 2C,D; Supplemental Table 1;
Hobbs et al. 2012). In addition to Sall4, several genes
that are required for spermatogenesis were down-regu-
lated in both Thy1+ and c-Kit+ spermatogonia of the
PRC1cKO (Fig. 2C). For example, we observed the shared
down-regulation of Plzf, which functions in the mainte-
nance of undifferentiated spermatogonia, and Lin28a,
which functions in the expansion of undifferentiated sper-
matogonia (Buaas et al. 2004; Costoya et al. 2004; Chakra-
borty et al. 2014). We also observed the shared down-
regulation of Morc1, Tdrd9, and Piwil2 (also known as
Mili), all of which are required for repression of transpos-
able elements in spermatogenesis (Kuramochi-Miyagawa
et al. 2004; Shoji et al. 2009; Pastor et al. 2014). Further-
more, the down-regulated genes in c-Kit+ spermatogonia
of the PRC1cKO include genes required for several key
processes of spermatogenesis (Fig. 2D; Supplemental Fig.
S4E); in normal spermatogenesis, these genes are highly
activated during the differentiation from Thy1+ to c-Kit+
spermatogonia (Fig. 2E). The down-regulated genes in c-
Kit+ spermatogonia of the PRC1cKO include those that
function in the differentiation/maintenance of spermato-
gonia (Dmrt1, Nxf2, Sohlh1, and Sohlh2) (Pan et al. 2009;
Matson et al. 2010; Suzuki et al. 2012), meiotic initiation
(Stra8 and Dazl) (Anderson et al. 2008; Lin et al. 2008), and
transposon repression and/or regulation of piRNA (Tdrkh,

This group also includes Scml2, which encodes a germ-
line-specific Polycomb protein that is required for the sup-
pression of somatic genes in spermatogenesis (Hasegawa
et al. 2015); the tumor suppressor gene Rb, which encodes
an essential factor in cell cycle regulation that is also re-
quired for stem cell maintenance (Hu et al. 2013); and sev-
eral DNA damage response, repair, and recombination
genes that are required for spermatogonia and/or meiosis,
including Brca1 (Turner et al. 2004; Broering et al. 2014),
Tex15 (Yang et al. 2008a), Fancd2 (Alavattam et al.

Tex11 (Yang et al. 2008b), Atm (Takubo et al. 2008),
Rad51 (Dai et al. 2017), and Blm (Holloway et al. 2010).
Therefore, we conclude that PRC1 has an essential role
in the timely activation of germline genes during sperma-
togonial differentiation.
Since many of the genes involved in the suppression of
retrotransposons were down-regulated in the PRC1cKO,
we examined the expression of retrotransposons by ana-
lyzing RNA-seq data. However, we found that expression
of retrotransposons did not change between PRC1cKO
and PRC1ctrl spermatogonia (Supplemental Fig. S5A).
On the other hand, we found a modest up-regulation of
GSAT, a representative of major satellite DNA, in both
Thy1+ and c-Kit+ cells and a modest up-regulation of SAT-
MIN, a representative of minor satellite DNA, in Thy1+
cells. To further evaluate changes in retrotransposon ex-
pression, we performed immunostaining against LINE1
ORF1 protein (ORF1p). We found that LINE1 ORF1p
was not derepressed in PRC1cKO testes but was expressed
at a similar level between PRC1cKO and PRC1ctrl testes
(Supplemental Fig. S5B); this expression level was similar
to previous observations of expression in wild-type testes
(Soper et al. 2008). These results suggest that PRC1 is re-
quired for the suppression of major and minor satellite
DNA but not for the suppression of retrotransposons in
spermatogenesis, although PRC1 activates genes involved
in the suppression of retrotransposons.
RNF2 directly binds to TSSs of activated genes
in spermatogonia
Although Polycomb complexes are known as gene sup-
pressors, recent studies have revealed an additional func-
tion of Polycomb in direct gene activation (Creppe et al.
2014; Gao et al. 2014). To determine whether PRC1
directly activates germline genes during spermatogenesis,
we analyzed the genomic distribution of Polycomb
proteins by investigating ChIP-seq (chromatin immuno-
precipitation [ChIP] combined with high-throughput se-
quencing) data of GS cells (Hasegawa et al. 2015), which
are a cultured spermatogonial stem cell population that
retains stem cell potential. In GS cells, RNF2 was present
near TSSs of genes down-regulated in PRC1cKO sperma-
togonia, such as Sall4 (Fig. 3A). Average tag density anal-
ysis
revealed
that
in
GS
cells,
RNF2
was
highly
associated with TSSs of genes down-regulated in Thy1+
spermatogonia of the PRC1cKO and was also associated
with TSSs and gene bodies of genes up-regulated in the
PRC1cKO (Fig. 3B), consistent with a canonical role of
PRC1 in gene repression. These results suggest that, in ad-
dition to its canonical function in gene repression, RNF2
directly binds a group of transcriptionally active germline
genes. The specificity of these peaks was confirmed with
the analysis of input chromatin using GS cells (Supple-
mental Fig. S6A). Importantly, in GS cells, RNF2 was pre-
loaded to genes that are either down-regulated or up-
regulated in subsequent c-Kit+ differentiating spermato-
gonia (Fig. 3C). This result suggests that RNF2 binding
in the stem cell phase predicts gene regulation in later
stages, which is consistent with the notion that unidirec-
tional differentiation of spermatogenesis is preset by epi-
genetic mechanisms in the stem cell stage (Hasegawa
et al. 2015; Sin et al. 2015).
In contrast to RNF2, H2AK119ub and another PRC1
subunit, BMI1, were not highly associated with the TSSs
of down-regulated genes in the PRC1cKO, although they
were highly associated with up-regulated genes (Supple-
mental Fig. S6B–D), suggesting that the function of
RNF2 in gene activation is at least in part independent
of H2AK119ub and BMI1. Between up-regulated and
down-regulated genes in the PRC1cKO, the distinct bind-
ing profiles of RNF2, BMI1, and H2AK119ub suggest that
the mechanisms underlying RNF2-dependent gene acti-
vation and suppression are likely to be distinct.
RNF2 and SALL4 together occupy TSSs of germline genes
for activation
Because our data suggest that RNF2 functions in gene ac-
tivation in a mechanism distinct from its role in gene sup-
pression, we next searched for a cofactor working with
RNF2 in gene activation. Since Sall4 is the gene with
the lowest P-value for down-regulation in both the
Thy1+ and c-Kit+ spermatogonia of the PRC1cKO, we

 examined the genomic localization of the SALL4 tran-
scription factor using published ChIP-seq data of in vitro
cultures of Thy1+ spermatogonia (Lovelace et al. 2016).
SALL4 occupies its own regulatory element in the vicinity
of its TSS at the Sall4 gene locus, and SALL4 peaks largely
overlapped with those of RNF2, although we observed
some RNF2 peaks independent of SALL4 (Fig. 3A). We
also found that, together, RNF2 and SALL4 occupy TSSs
of RNF2-dependent germline genes, such as Tdrkh and
Mael (Fig. 4A). Average tag density analysis revealed
that SALL4 is highly associated with down-regulated
genes in Thy1+ spermatogonia of the PRC1cKO as com-
pared with up-regulated genes, and this tendency is
more evident for genes down-regulated in c-Kit+ sperma-
togonia of the PRC1cKO (Fig. 4B). In addition, enrichment
analysis around TSSs revealed that down-regulated genes
in Thy1+ and c-Kit+ spermatogonia of the PRC1cKO were
enriched with both SALL4 and RNF2, while up-regulated
genes were not (Fig. 4C). Additional enrichment analysis
confirmed that the coenrichment of H2AK119ub and
RNF2 occurred only on TSSs of up-regulated genes in c-
Kit+ spermatogonia of the PRC1cKO and not on TSSs of
down-regulated genes (Fig. 4D).
Consistent with the enrichment of SALL4 in ChIP-seq
data of Thy1+ spermatogonia, SALL4 localized in the nu-
clei of PLZF+ undifferentiated spermatogonia in PRC1ctrl
testes (Fig. 5A). RNF2 localized in the nuclei of prosper-
matogonia through to meiotic pachytene spermatocytes;
SALL4, on the other hand, gradually accumulated in the
nuclei of spermatogonia (Hobbs et al. 2012; Gassei and
Orwig 2013), with its greatest enrichment in differentiat-
ing spermatogonia, after which it disappeared from nuclei
during the leptotene/zygotene stages of meiotic prophase
(Supplemental Fig. S7). However, SALL4 localization was
absent in PLZF+ undifferentiated spermatogonia of the
PRC1cKO (Fig. 5A), in accord with the RNF2-dependent
transcriptional activation of Sall4 (Fig. 2). These results
suggest that RNF2 promotes transcriptional activation
and subsequent nuclear accumulation of SALL4, and
then RNF2 and SALL4 together occupy a cohort of germ-
line genes for activation during spermatogenesis. Consis-
tent with the depletion of SALL4 in the PRC1cKO, the
spermatogenic defects reported for Sall4cKO mice (Hobbs
et al. 2012) are similar to the phenotypes of PRC1cKO
mice with regard to the gradual depletion of the stem
cell compartment and the decreased numbers of differen-
tiating spermatogonia. Thus, it is conceivable that the ap-
optotic cell death observed in the PRC1cKO is due to
defective RNF2-dependent activation of germline genes
such as Sall4.
To further define the mode of gene regulation by RNF2
and SALL4, we performed k-means clustering analysis of
genes up-regulated and down-regulated in the PRC1cKO
(Fig. 5B; Supplemental Fig. S8A; Supplemental Table 2).
Up-regulated

of
the
PRC1cKO comprised three clusters: Cluster 3 (67 genes)
was highly enriched with genes bound by PRC1, including
BMI1 and H2AK119ub, but not with SALL4, thus repre-
senting genes targeted for suppression by PRC1. Cluster
1 (76 genes) was enriched with genes bound by RNF2
and SALL4, suggesting that RNF2 and SALL4 together oc-
cupy a small subset of suppressed genes. Genes in cluster
2 (126 genes) were not highly enriched with PRC1 and
SALL4 and were thus likely to be indirect targets. Con-
trastingly, in down-regulated genes in c-Kit+ spermatogo-
nia of the PRC1cKO, RNF2 and SALL4 enrichment was

 found extensively, as seen in clusters 4 and 6 (respectively,
1035 and 285 genes). Cluster 5 (61 genes) consisted of
genes indirectly activated by RNF2. To determine the
gene expression profiles of PRC1-regulated genes in stages
of spermatogenesis beyond that of differentiating sperma-
togonia, we analyzed RNA-seq data of wild-type meiotic
pachytene spermatocytes and post-meiotic spermato-
cytes (Supplemental Fig. S8B). Our analyses revealed
that genes in clusters 4 and 6 tend to be expressed in
pachytene spermatocytes and round spermatids, although
expression levels vary for each gene.
Finally, we independently confirmed the co-occupancy
of RNF2 and SALL4 using peaks detected through MAn-
orm analysis (Shao et al. 2012). While RNF2 and SALL4
peaks were distributed in different places throughout the
genome, RNF2 and SALL4 common peaks were enriched
in promoter regions (Fig. 5C), suggesting that large sets of
RNF2 and SALL4 peaks occupy TSSs together in undiffer-
entiated spermatogonia.
RNF2 interacts with SALL4 to work together
for gene activation
The above results suggested the existence of an RNF2–
SALL4 complex for gene activation. To test for an in
vivo interaction between RNF2 and SALL4, we performed
coimmunoprecipitation of RNF2 and SALL4 using wild-
type testicular extracts. Our results confirmed an in vivo
interaction between RNF2 and SALL4 (Fig. 6A). To vali-
date the direct function of RNF2 and SALL4 in gene acti-
vation, we performed luciferase reporter assays that
measure the activity of regulatory elements under condi-
tions where RNF2 and SALL4 are expressed. We per-
formed a dual-luciferase reporter assay, in which the
activity of regulatory elements was indicated by the ex-
pression of NanoLuc luciferase (Nluc) driven by a mini-
mal promoter and normalized to the expression of
control firefly luciferase (Fluc) driven by a PGK promoter
(Fig. 6B). First, we performed the dual-luciferase reporter
assay using kidney-derived mK4 cells. While Sall4 regula-
tory regions (the regions near TSSs, shown as the Sall4
TSSs) did not respond with RNF2 and/or SALL4 in mK4
cells (data not shown), RNF2 and SALL4 act on the regu-
latory regions of Mael and Tdrkh (Mael TSS and Tdrkh
TSS) for gene activation (Fig. 6B).
Next, we sought to perform dual-luciferase reporter as-
says with GS cells to test the gene activation function of
an RNF2–SALL4 complex in a context that resembles
the in vivo activation of germline genes. However, we
found that the transient transfection of GS cells was
very inefficient (data not shown). Instead, we tested em-
bryonic stem (ES) cells treated with vitamin C or retinoic
acid (RA), an active metabolite of vitamin A, both of
which induce differentiation and the expression of germ-
line genes (Blaschke et al. 2013; Suzuki et al. 2016). In ES
cells, the Sall4 TSS was activated by RNF2 or SALL4
only after RA treatment, while vitamin C treatment
did not change the responsiveness of the Sall4 TSS
(Fig. 6C). Reverse orientation of the Sall4 TSS did not
work in the assay (Fig. 6C), confirming the specific regu-
latory action of the Sall4 TSS in cis. Intriguingly, the
Mael TSS and Tdrkh TSS were highly activated when
both RNF2 and SALL4 were expressed, and responsive-
ness increased when ES cells were treated with RA
(Fig. 6D). For the Mael TSS, responsiveness further in-
creased when ES cells were treated with both RA and vi-
tamin C. These data indicate that RNF2 and SALL4 act
on regulatory elements of germline genes for activation
during differentiation, supporting the notion that an
RNF2–SALL4-activating complex promotes activation
of germline genes.
Together, our study identifies a mechanism by which a
cohort of germline genes is directly activated in spermato-
gonia, in which RNF2 activates transcription of Sall4, and
RNF2 and SALL4 then act together on target genes for ac-
tivation (Fig. 6E).
Discussion
Our study establishes a framework for the regulation of
germline genes during spermatogenesis. In particular, we
demonstrate that RNF2 is required for the activation of
many critical regulators of spermatogenesis. Importantly,

 spermatogonia is opposite to its role in female primordial
germ cells, in which RNF2 suppresses the expression of
Stra8 to prevent precocious entry into meiosis (Yokobaya-
shi et al. 2013). Our luciferase assays demonstrated that
regulatory elements of germline genes become responsive
when ES cells are treated with RA, the major chemical
determinant of spermatogenic differentiation (Griswold
2016). Since Stra8 is induced by RA, the distinct functions
of RNF2 to regulate Stra8 likely depend on the presence of
RA.
The function of RNF2 in the activation of germline
genes may likely be independent of PRC2, the other major
set of Polycomb complexes, as dysregulation of germline
genes was not observed in spermatogenesis lacking com-
ponents of PRC2 (Mu et al. 2014). A notable common fea-
ture between PRC1 and PRC2 mutant mice is that
Cdkn2a, which encodes an essential cell cycle suppressor,
is a major Polycomb target in somatic cells yet remains re-
pressed in germ cells deficient for PRC1 (data not shown)
and PRC2 (Mu et al. 2014). These results suggest that the
cell cycle undergoes distinct regulation in spermatogonia
versus somatic cells. Because multiple Polycomb sub-
units are exchanged to acquire specific functions for dif-
ferent biological contexts (Gao et al. 2012; Tavares et al.
2012), it is possible that distinct Polycomb complexes
containing RNF2 serve as an activator of germline genes.
One intriguing possibility is that SALL4 dissociates the
PRC1 complex, transforming it from a repressive complex
into an “activating” complex. Since RNF2 stably associ-
ates with nuclei in male germ cells, it is possible that
RNF2 is preloaded to target genes, and, later, SALL4 is re-
cruited to these target loci. In support of this, SALL4 local-
ization is dynamic during spermatogenesis. Furthermore,
literature supports the possibility that RNF2 is preloaded
to target genes. A recent report demonstrated that the
same class of germline genes identified in the present
study (and which includes Mael and Tdrkh) is suppressed
by PCGF6-containing PRC1 (PCGF6–PRC1), a noncanon-
ical PRC1, in ES cells (Endoh et al. 2017). In primordial
germ cells, PRC1 suppresses germline genes (Yokobayashi
et al. 2013). Therefore, it is conceivable that PCGF6–
PRC1 targets germline genes in early development and
continues to suppress them in early germ cell stages until
such time that the germline genes are required for later
stages in germ cell development. This possible function
of PCGF6 may explain why germline genes are not fully
associated with BMI1 (also known as PCGF4): The diver-
sity of PRC1 complexes could depend, in part, on the pres-
ence of distinct PCGF factors (Gao et al. 2012).
The PCGF6–PRC1 complex forms a stable complex
with the core PRC1 subunit RNF2, the epigenetic regula-
tor L3MBTL2, and the transcription factor MAX (Gao
et al. 2012). Both L3MBTL2 and MAX are known to sup-
press germline genes in ES cells (Qin et al. 2012; Maeda
et al. 2013), and, furthermore, the loss of MAX promotes
spermatogenic differentiation and meiotic entry in ES
cells and GS cells (Suzuki et al. 2016). Thus, we speculate
that PCGF6–PRC1 is transformed into an RNF2–SALL4-
activating complex through the progressive removal of
PCGF6, L3MBTL2, and MAX during spermatogenic
differentiation. Interestingly, the suppression of germline
genes in ES cells depends on the deposition of H2AK119ub
(Endoh et al. 2017), and H2AK119ub is depleted from
germline genes in undifferentiated spermatogonia when

 they are activated. Together, these results raise the
compelling possibility that PRC1 has context-dependent
functions through changing subunit compositions and
H2AK119ub deposition. In future studies, it would be in-
triguing to identify Polycomb proteins working with
RNF2 for gene activation.
Materials and methods
Animals
Generation of mutant Ring1 and Rnf2 floxed alleles was reported
previously (del Mar Lorente et al. 2000; Cales et al. 2008).
Ddx4-Cre transgenic mice were purchased from the Jackson Lab-
oratory (Gallardo et al. 2007). For each experiment, a minimum of
three independent mice was analyzed. The Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee approved this work (protocol no.
IACUC2015-0032).
Antibodies
A list of antibodies used in this study is in the Supplemental
Material.
Germ cell fractionation
Spermatogonia, isolated as described previously (Hasegawa et al.
2015), were collected from C57Bl/6N mice at 6–8 d of age. Testes
were collected in a 24-well plate in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (DMEM) supplemented with GlutaMax (Thermo Fisher
Scientific), nonessential amino acids (NEAA) (Thermo Fisher Sci-
entific), penicillin, and streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
After removing the tunica albuginea, testes were digested with
1 mg/mL collagenase for 20 min at 34°C to remove interstitial
cells and then centrifuged at 188g for 5 min. Tubules were washed
with the medium and then digested with 2.5 mg/mL trypsin for
20 min at 34°C to obtain a single-cell suspension. Cells were fil-
tered with a 40-µm strainer to remove Sertoli cells, and the cell
suspension was plated in a 24-well plate for 1 h in medium supple-
mented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), which promoted the
adhesion of the remaining somatic cells. Germ cells were washed
with MACS buffer (PBS supplemented with 0.5% BSA, 5 mM
EDTA) and incubated with CD117 (c-Kit) MicroBeads (Miltenyi
Biotec) for 20 min on ice. Cells were washed and resuspended
with MACS buffer and filtered with a 40-µm strainer. Cells
were separated by autoMACS Pro Separator (Miltenyi Biotec)
with the program “possel.” Cells in the flowthrough fraction
were washed with MACS buffer and incubated with CD90.2
(Thy1) MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec) for 20 min on ice. Cells
were washed and resuspended with MACS buffer, filtered with
a 40-µm strainer, and then separated by autoMACS Pro Separator
(Miltenyi Biotec) with the program “posseld.” Purity was con-
firmed by RNA-seq analysis and immunostaining.
Histology and immunohistochemistry
For preparation of testicular paraffin blocks, testes were fixed
with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) overnight at 4°C. Testes were
dehydrated and embedded in paraffin. For histological analysis,
4-µm-thick paraffin sections were deparaffinized and stained
with hematoxylin and eosin. For immunohistochemistry, 7-µm-
thick paraffin sections were deparaffinized and autoclaved in tar-
get retrieval solution (DAKO) for 10 min at 121°C. Sections were
blocked with Blocking One Histo (Nacalai) for 1 h at room tem-
perature and then incubated with primary antibodies overnight
at 4°C. The resulting signals were detected by incubation with
secondary antibodies conjugated to fluorophores (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Biotium, or Jackson ImmunoResearch). Sections were
counterstained with DAPI. Images were obtained by confocal la-
ser scanning microscope (A1R, Nikon) and processed with NIS-
Elements (Nikon) and ImageJ (National Institutes of Health).
Code availability: analysis of ChIP-seq results
ChIP-seq data for RNF2, input, BMI1, and H2AK119ub in GS cells
were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (accession
no. GSE55060) (Hasegawa et al. 2015). ChIP-seq data for SALL4 in
Thy1+ spermatogonia were downloaded from the Gene Expres-
sion Omnibus (accession no. GSE73390) (Lovelace et al. 2016).
Data analysis was performed in the Wardrobe experiment man-
agement system (https://code.google.com/p/genome-tools) (Kar-
tashov and Barski 2015). Briefly, reads were aligned to the
mouse genome (mm10) with Bowtie version 1.0.0 (Langmead
et al. 2009) before being displayed as coverage on a local mirror
of the University of California at Santa Cruz Genome Browser.
Peaks of RNF2, input, BMI1, H2AK119ub, and SALL4 enrich-
ment were identified using MACS2 version 2.1.0.20140616
(Zhang et al. 2008). MAnorm, software designed for quantitative
comparison of ChIP-seq data sets (Shao et al. 2012), was applied to
compare genome-wide SALL4 and RNF2 profiles. Unique peaks
were defined using the following criteria: (1) defined as “unique”
by the MAnorm algorithm, (2) P-value of <0.01, and (3) raw read
counts of unique peaks >20. Common peaks between the
SALL4 and RNF2 data sets were defined using the following cri-
teria: (1) defined as “common” by MAnorm algorithm and (2)
raw read counts of both stages >20. Average tag density profiles
were calculated around RefSeq TSSs. The resulting graphs were
smoothed in 200-base-pair windows. Enrichment levels for
ChIP-seq experiments were calculated for 4-kb windows at pro-
moter regions of the genes (±2 kb surrounding TSSs). Tag values
were normalized as follows: Read counts were multiplied by
1,000,000 and then divided by the total number of reads in each
nucleotide position. Total amounts of tag values in promoter re-
gions were calculated as enrichment.
RNA-seq
Total RNA was purified from Thy1+ or c-Kit+ spermatogonia us-
ing an RNeasy microkit (Qiagen) according to the manual provid-
ed. RNA quality and quantity were checked using Bioanalyzer
(Agilent) and Qubit (Life Technologies), respectively. The initial
amplification step was performed with the NuGEN Ovation
RNA-seq system version 2. The assay was used to amplify RNA
samples and create double-stranded cDNA. Libraries were then
created with the Nextera XT DNA sample preparation kit (Illu-
mina) and sequenced with an Illumina HiSeq 2500. RNA-seq
data analysis was performed in the Wardrobe experiment man-
agement system (https://code.google.com/p/genome-tools) (Kar-
tashov and Barski 2015). Briefly, reads were mapped to the
mm10 genome using TopHat version 2.0.9 (Trapnell et al. 2012)
and assigned to the RefSeq genes (or isoforms) using the Wardrobe
algorithm. Differential gene expression analysis was performed
using DESeq2 (Love et al. 2014) in the Wardrobe environment.
For GO analysis, the Database for Annotation, Visualization,
and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) was used to identify the GO
terms (Huang et al. 2009).

 A Bowtie2 index was created using the function “bowtie2-build.”
Raw RNA-seq reads were aligned to repetitive sequences using
the default parameters of Bowtie2. A table of aligned read counts
per repetitive element was extracted from sorted .bam files using
the SAMtools function “idxtats.” A read count output file was in-
put to the DESeq2 package (Love et al. 2014); comparison of ex-
pression levels of each repetitive element between the PRC1ctrl
and the PRC1cKO was performed using the functions “DESeq-
DataSetFromMatrix” and “DESeq.” Differentially expressed re-
petitive elements between the PRC1ctrl and the PRC1cKO were
identified by two criteria: more than twofold change and Wald
test (P < 0.05).
Cell culture
The mouse ES cell line J1 was maintained in DMEM (Thermo
Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 20% FBS (HyClone), 25
mM HEPES (pH 7.2–7.5) (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 1% MEM
NEAA (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 1% GlutaMAX-I (Thermo
Fisher Scientific), 100 U/mL penicillin–streptomycin (Thermo
Fisher Scientific), 0.1 mM β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma), and 500
U/mL leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). The cells were cultured
in feeder-free conditions on 0.1% gelatin-coated tissue culture
plates. For differentiation experiments, ES cells were treated for
72 h with 100 µg/mL vitamin C and/or 1 µM all-trans RA without
LIF (Blaschke et al. 2013; Suzuki et al. 2016). The mK4 cells
(Valerius et al. 2002) were cultured in DMEM with GlutaMAX
(Thermo Fisher Scientific), 10% FBS, and 100 U/mL penicillin–
streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Plasmid constructions
For construction of expression vectors for RNF2 and SALL4 with
an N-terminal 3xFlag tag, the full-length RNF2 or SALL4 coding
sequence was amplified by PCR using Q5 High-Fidelity 2X mas-
ter mix (New England Biolabs) with primers containing the
3xFlag tag sequence. The PCR product was inserted into the
pGL3.54 vector (Promega) at the luc2 gene locus. To generate re-
porter vectors, DNA fragments around TSSs of Sall4, Mael, or
Tdrkh were designed based on RNF2- and SALL4-binding sites
detected by MAnorm analysis and synthesized by IDT as gBlocks
gene fragments. We chose the minus strand of chromosome 2
(168,766,670–168,767,574) for the Sall4 TSS, the minus strand
of chromosome 1 (166,238,666–166,239,118) for the Mael TSS,
and the plus strand of chromosome 3 (94,412,744–94,413,466)
for the Tdrkh TSS. The gBlocks gene fragments were inserted be-
tween the XhoI and BglII sites of the pNL3.2 vector (Promega). For
a positive control reporter vector, a DNA fragment of the PGK
promoter was inserted into the pNL3.2 vector.
Dual-luciferase reporter assays
The Nano-Glo dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega)
was used to measure promoter activities. Briefly, 5 × 104 ES cells
or 3 × 104 mK4 cells were seeded in TC-treated 96-well solid
white polystyrene microplates (Corning) 1 d before transfection.
Transient transfections were performed in OptiMEM (Thermo
Fisher Scientific) with Lipofectamine 3000 reagent (Thermo Fish-
er Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The
cells were transfected with combinations of pGL3.54, a control
reporter; pNL3.2 inserted with or without the Sall4 TSS, Mael
TSS, Tdrkh TSS, or PGK promoter as an experimental reporter;
and expression vectors for RNF2 and SALL4. Three to five repli-
cates were used for each condition. For ES cells, the medium
was replaced with vitamin C- and/or RA-containing medium or
LIF-containing medium after 5 h of transfection. The medium
was replaced every 24 h. After 72 h of treatment, dual-luciferase
assays were performed according to the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions (Promega). For mK4 cells, dual-luciferase assays were per-
formed 48 h after transfection. Light signals were acquired with
the Synergy H1 hybrid multimode microplate reader (BioTek),
and the relative response ratio (RRR) was calculated according
to the manufacturer’s instructions (Promega). Normalized RRR
is shown as normalized Nluc/Fluc luminescence.
Coimmunoprecipitation
Single-cell suspension from juvenile whole testes (P12–P19; five
to eight mice) was prepared by treatment with collagenase and
trypsin as described above. Cells were suspended in 1 mL of buffer
A (10 mM HEPES-KOH at pH 7.9, 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2,
0.34 M sucrose, 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, protease inhibitors
[Roche]) and disrupted with 35 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer
with a tight-fitting pestle. Lysates were centrifuged at 1700g for 10
min at 4°C. Nuclear pellets were washed with buffer A and sus-
pended with 500 µL of buffer B (20 mM HEPES-KOH at pH 7.9,
50 mM KCl, 5 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mM
DTT, protease inhibitors, 1 µL MNase [New England Biolabs],
100 U of benzonase [Sigma]). Nuclei were incubated for 10 min
at 37°C and then further disrupted by sonication. EGTA (10 mM
final), 300 mM NaCl (final), and 0.2% NP-40 (final) were added
to the lysates. The lysates were incubated with rotation at 20
rpm for 1 h at 4°C and centrifuged at 8000g for 10 min at 4°C. Su-
pernatant was transferred to a new tube; mixed with an equal vol-
ume of buffer C (20 mM HEPES-KOH at pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 0.5
mM DTT, protease inhibitors); incubated with anti-RNF2 (MBL),
anti-SALL4 (Abcam) antibody, or control IgG overnight at 4°C;
and mixed with Dynabeads Protein G (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
The beads were washed four times with buffer D (20 mM HEPES-
KOH at pH 7.9, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.05% NP-40, 0.5
mM DTT). The bound proteins were eluted with Laemmli buffer
for 5 min at 95°C and analyzed by Western blotting.
