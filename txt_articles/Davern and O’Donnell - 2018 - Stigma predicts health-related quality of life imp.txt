Abstract
Acne vulgaris has been associated with deficits in psychological well-being and health-
related quality of life. Few studies have investigated how stigma contributes to our under-
standing of the well-being of acne sufferers, although it is clear that acne is stigmatized and
stigmatization is associated with impaired well-being. The current study aimed to investigate
the ability of perceived stigma to predict health-related quality of life, psychological distress,
and somatic symptoms over and above established predictors. University students and staff
suffering from acne completed self-report measures online. Hierarchical multiple regression
analyses showed that perceived stigma significantly contributed to the prediction of all three
well-being measures, over and above the effects of gender, acne severity, acne location,
and use of medication. Indeed, perceived stigma made the largest unique contribution to
predicting well-being. Our findings suggest that interventions that attempt to counter stigma
could also improve the overall well-being of people affected by acne.
Introduction
The skin is a highly prominent feature of the human body, is an important element of per-
ceived attractiveness, and is often used to denote information about a person’s health, age and
background. Acne vulgaris is a skin condition that affects up to 80% of the population during
adolescence [1] and is characterized by the manifestation of whiteheads, blackheads, pustules,
papules and cysts that vary in frequency and severity depending on the extent of the sufferer’s
condition. Although adolescents are most commonly afflicted by acne, the condition has been
reported to affect 10.8% of children between the ages of 5–13 years and 12.7% of adults aged
over 59 [2]. The condition has also been associated with several consequences for more general
well-being, including depression [3–5], decreased self-confidence [6], fatigue [7], poorer body
image satisfaction [8, 9], and increased suicidal ideation [10]. The aspects of the acne experi-
ence that contribute most to predicting such impaired well-being have not yet been adequately
explored. In the current paper, we investigate the ability of a social psychological factor, stigma,
to help predict relevant measures of impaired well-being in those who suffer from acne.

 In the literature on dermatological conditions, including acne, health-related quality of life
is a well-being measure that has received substantial attention. It has been defined as the ‘func-
tional effect of an illness and its consequent therapy upon a patient, as perceived by the patient’
[11]. To expand further, health-related quality of life is a multidimensional construct that
accounts for the impact of an individual’s condition on psychological, physical and social
domains of well-being [12]. Measuring dermatology-specific health-related quality of life
allows researchers to assess the efficacy of treatment options and compare the impact of acne
to other skin conditions [13]–and understanding the factors that predict health-related quality
of life is important in this. Evidence from existing research suggests that acne has wide-ranging
effects, including a negative association with health-related quality of life [14–15].
In seeking to understand this effect, to date, researchers have identified a diverse range of
factors that predict the health-related quality of life of acne sufferers; these factors are mainly
demographic and practical in nature. For instance, gender differences have been found in past
research, with females tending to experience greater impairment than males [15–17]. In some
studies, individuals with greater acne severity have been found to have decreased health-
related quality of life compared to those with milder acne [1, 18], though other studies have
documented that the effects of severity are not important [4, 19]. Additionally, it has been sug-
gested that patients’ perceptions of acne severity are more important to consider than physi-
cian-reported severity, due to the consequences that acne has on body image and self-
confidence [20]. Acne location also appears to be important: acne mostly affects the face, and
individuals with facial acne—in comparison to those with truncal acne—have been shown to
have poorer body image satisfaction [9], higher feelings of unattractiveness [21] and decreased
health-related quality of life [22]. Finally, successful response to treatments such as isotretinoin
[16] and erythromycin-zinc [17] has been demonstrated to have a positive impact on health-
related quality of life.
As such, the predictive utility of these demographical and practical factors in determining
levels of health-related quality of life in acne sufferers is clear, but there has been less focus on
factors that could be considered social psychological or social structural. We argue that one
aspect of acne sufferers’ experiences that has not received sufficient attention is the potential
role of stigma. Stigma is a socially constructed process that occurs whereby a person or group
possesses an ‘attribute that is deeply discrediting’ ([23], p. 3) that results in discrimination and
social devaluation. Stigmatization involves identifying an individual or group as being differ-
ent, labelling them with unfavorable stereotypes, and delineating the differences between those
subjected to stigma and others in society [24]. Stigmatized identities can be ascribed due to
physical differences or through association with past events judged negatively by society [25].
In line with this, there is some evidence that acne sufferers perceive greater stigmatization
related to their skin than people without acne [26] and that this is associated with impaired
psychological functioning [15]. These findings, although rare, are reinforced by findings show-
ing the experience of stigmatization for individuals with other skin conditions, such as leprosy
[27], vitiligo [28] and atopic dermatitis [29]. Moreover, there is research evidence demonstrat-
ing that others do stigmatize and discriminate against acne sufferers. For instance, a recent
study demonstrated that non-sufferers perceive those with acne as unattractive, and anticipate
experiencing shame upon developing the condition themselves [30]. Additionally, based on a
qualitative study, Magin et al. [6] noted that acne sufferers reported being subjected to bully-
ing, teasing and social exclusion. As such, we know that those with acne are stigmatized, but
there is not yet much evidence of specifically how this relates to well-being.
To date, one study demonstrated that higher levels of perceived stigma predicted greater
impairment of health-related quality of life, and that perceived stigma contributed more to
predicting health-related quality of life than factors typically examined such as gender, age and

 acne severity [15]. This analysis was the first to examine the effects of perceived stigma on the
health-related quality of life of acne sufferers, and the results have not yet been verified in sub-
sequent research. While Liasides and Apergi [15] solely focused on the association between
perceived stigma and health-related quality of life, the current study seeks to investigate a
wider range of well-being outcomes. In doing so, we seek to contribute meaningfully to litera-
tures on the health outcomes associated with acne, but also stigmatized groups more generally.
Specifically, our study attempts to build on previous research by examining the link
between perceived stigma and health-related quality of life, as well as two further well-being
outcomes that are of interest in the broader stigmatized identities literature; psychological dis-
tress and somatic symptoms. Indeed, an extensive body of research demonstrates that the
experience, anticipation and/or internalization of stigma is associated with increased psycho-
logical distress [24, 31–34] and physical health problems, including increased somatic symp-
toms in those who are unemployed (e.g., sleeplessness, headaches, colds; [35, 36]) and a variety
of negative physical health outcomes in individuals with HIV/AIDS (e.g., coughing, nausea,
chest pain [33]; reduced physical well-being [37]; low CD4 count [38]).
Importantly, while recent developments in this literature often relate to concealable stigma-
tized identities such as HIV/AIDS, there is also a considerable body of research relating to visi-
ble stigma. For example, previous research has illustrated that individuals with visible
differences such as race [39], obesity [40] and hair loss [41] are stigmatized and marginalized
by society due to their distinctions, and that this stigma is associated with impaired well-being
[32]. However, in this body of work there is less focus on skin conditions such as acne, and so
the impact of stigmatization on outcomes such as psychological distress and somatic symp-
toms has not yet been investigated in acne sufferers. The current study will address this gap.
Similarly, in the literature on dermatological conditions, there has so far been less attention
on how stigma relates to health-related quality of life in people who suffer from acne, com-
pared to other skin conditions. We currently know more about how stigmatization has been
linked with poorer health-related quality of life in studies analyzing skin conditions such as
psoriasis [25], vitiligo [28] and atopic dermatitis [29]. As such, it is clear that the current study
can meaningfully develop both literatures by examining the capacity for stigma to predict
well-being outcomes in acne sufferers.
It should be noted that studies in these two literatures tend to use slightly different well-
being outcomes. While some of the psychological literature on stigmatized identities relates to
general well-being outcomes such as quality of life [42–43], more often the focus is on psycho-
logical distress, specifically referring to depression and anxiety, and to some extent physical
health problems including somatic symptoms. Such constructs share similarity with health-
related quality of life, which is more often investigated in relation to dermatological conditions
[25, 28–29], and which focuses on the impact of the condition on psychological, physical and
social domains of well-being. While health-related quality of life is in some senses a broader
measure, it also relates explicitly to the dermatological condition, in this case acne. Conversely,
studies of stigmatized identities tend to take an overall measure of psychological distress and/
or physical health symptoms, and examine to what extent these are predicted by stigmatiza-
tion. As such, in seeking to build upon and extend both literatures, we argue it is important to
investigate how stigmatization of acne contributes to our understanding of all three well-being
outcomes: health-related quality of life, psychological distress and somatic symptoms. In the
present study, we examine to what extent experienced stigmatization of acne can be used to
predict health-related quality of life, psychological distress and somatic symptoms, over and
above established predictors of well-being in this group (gender, acne severity, acne location,
and medication).

 Individuals labelled with stigmatized identities experience shame and dejection due to per-
ceptions that they are not meeting the expectations of wider society [8]. We focus on perceived
stigma; that is, people’s perceptions that they have been subject to discrimination due to having
acne (similar to experienced stigma). We chose this focus because acne is a visible distinction;
as such, other popular measures such as anticipated stigma are less relevant. For example,
anticipated stigma is more relevant in studies of concealable stigmatized identities, where
many people hide the stigmatizing condition yet still anticipate being stigmatized if their secret
was known (e.g., [31]). In relation to the outcomes in our study, we measure health-related
quality of life in terms of self-report of how acne impacts participants’ quality of life, as in prior
studies on skin conditions [25, 28–29]. We operationalize psychological distress as a composite
of the participants’ anxiety and depression levels, as acne sufferers have been documented to
exhibit increased anxiety and depression in comparison to non-sufferers [4–5, 21]. In line with
previous research [44–45], physical health is operationalized by assessing self-reported somatic
symptoms. We predict that stigmatization will contribute significantly towards the prediction
of health-related quality of life, psychological distress, and somatic symptoms, over and above
other established predictors—specifically gender, acne severity, acne location, and medication.
Materials and methods
Procedure
Ethical approval was granted by the Faculty of Education and Health Sciences Research Ethics
Committee at the University of Limerick (approval number: 2016_11_05_EHS), and the
research was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Hel-
sinki. As approved by our Research Ethics Committee, the participants indicated their
informed consent by clicking “Continue” to move from the information page to the start of
the survey, and by completing the survey. The participants in this cross-sectional study were
recruited through convenience sampling. Recruitment emails were sent to all students and
staff members on our university’s directory. The emails contained a hyperlink to the survey
which participants completed online using Questback software. The participants were required
to be at least 18 years of age and have experienced acne at any point two months prior to start-
ing the survey; there were no other inclusion/exclusion criteria. All participants were notified
that they were free to withdraw at any stage. They were debriefed following their participation.
Participants did not receive compensation for taking part in the study.
Measures
Each participant initially responded to demographic items and disclosed their gender, age and
position (staff or student). Additionally, they were presented with non-mandatory questions
regarding the nature of their acne. Specifically, the participants were asked if they consider
their acne to be mild, moderate or severe. Similar self-rated measures of severity have been
used in previous research investigating the psychological consequences of acne [20, 46]. The
participants were also requested to disclose the location of their acne; facial, truncal or facial/
truncal. The relation between acne location and psychological distress has been examined in
this manner previously [9]. Given that acne patients that are administered treatment have
been shown to experience improved psychological functioning [21], participants in the present
study were asked if they were taking medication or not.
Next, participants responded to our variables of interest, in the order presented below. In
our analyses, gender, acne location, acne severity and use of medication were considered con-
trol variables. Perceived stigma served as the predictor variable, while health-related quality of
life, psychological distress and somatic symptoms were the outcome variables.

 Perceived stigma.
Perceived stigma was measured using an adapted version of the Day-
to-Day Discrimination Scale [39]. The original scale describes nine different types of discrimi-
nation and participants indicate how often they have experienced each of these in the past
(e.g., ‘People act as if you are inferior.’) In the current study, the instructions requested the par-
ticipants to indicate on a scale ranging from 1 (Not at all) to 5 (Very often) how often they feel
they have experienced each type of discrimination in the past two months as a direct result of
having acne. Additionally, as in a previous study targeted towards a predominantly university-
age sample [33], we included six additional items that capture scenarios whereby such individ-
uals commonly experience social devaluation. An example is ‘People not wanting to get
involved in an intimate relationship with you’. Total scores could range from 15 to 75, with
higher scores representing greater perceived stigma. As in previous research investigating stig-
matized identities (e.g., [35]), very high internal reliability was found in the current study
(Cronbach’s α = 0.93).
Health-related quality of life. The participants’ health-related quality of life was mea-
sured using a modified version of the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI; [47]). This
10-item measure consists of questions examining how a person’s skin has affected their life in
six domains: symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, school/work, personal relation-
ships and treatments. In the current study, the items and instructions of the questionnaire
were modified to examine how the participants’ acne (as opposed to their skin disease in gen-
eral) has affected their lives in the past two months. The modified version also differed in that
one item which includes mention of gardening was altered to refer to attending college or
work, as much of our recruitment targeted students and gardening was assumed to be unlikely
to be present in a student’s weekly routine. Participants indicated on a scale ranging from 0
(Not at all) to 3 (Very much) how much each aspect of their lives were affected by their acne.
The total scores can range from 0 to 30, with higher scores signifying greater impairment of
health-related quality of life. The original DLQI measure has been used regularly in clinical set-
tings [13] and has been previously demonstrated to be an effective measure of the health-
related quality of life of acne patients [4, 16]. The modified measure demonstrated high inter-
nal reliability in the present study (Cronbach’s α = 0.86).
Psychological distress. Psychological distress was assessed by measuring the participants’
levels of anxiety and depression using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS;
[48]). The 14-item scale consists of statements about symptoms of anxiety and depression and
participants in the present study indicated the degree to which they had experienced each
symptom in the past two months on four-point scales ranging from 0 to 3. Six items were
reverse scored, while the anchors varied depending on the item. Total scores can range from 0
to 42 with higher scores indicating higher psychological distress. HADS has been previously
used in research examining patients with acne [21, 49]. The measure has been demonstrated to
be a valid measure of anxiety and depression symptoms [50]. In the current study, high inter-
nal reliability was observed (Cronbach’s α = 0.88).
Somatic symptoms.
The participants’ somatic symptoms were assessed using the 14-item
Physical Health Questionnaire (PHQ; [51]). The participants indicated on a scale ranging
from 1 (Not at all) to 7 (All of the time) how often they experienced each symptom in the past
two months. The somatic symptoms included sleep disturbances, headaches, respiratory infec-
tions and gastrointestinal problems. As in previous research [35–36, 52], the items were
summed into total scores which can range from 14 to 98. One item was reverse scored, with
higher total scores indicating poorer somatic health. The measure has been utilized in previous
research examining the relationship between perceived facial attractiveness and physical health
[45] and has been shown to be a reliable and valid measure of physical health [44, 51]. In the
present study, high internal reliability was observed (Cronbach’s α = 0.87).

 Participants
A total sample of 276 acne sufferers at a university in Ireland participated in this study (265
students, 11 staff members). Five participants were excluded after screening for outliers,
incomplete responses, and inattentive responding during preliminary analyses, resulting in a
final sample of 271 participants. Of this final sample, 81 participants were male (29.9%) and
190 were female (70.1%). Their ages ranged from 18 to 51 years (M = 21.63, SD = 4.88). Most
participants rated their acne as mild (35.4%) or moderate (52.0%), with a smaller proportion
considering their acne severe (12.6%). The majority were affected by single-domain facial acne
(52.8%) or both facial and truncal acne (39.8%), with single-domain truncal acne affecting the
fewest number (7.4%). In terms of treatment, 39.1% of participants were taking medication to
treat their acne.
Statistical analyses
We utilized IBM SPSS 23 to analyze the data. To test our prediction that stigmatization would
contribute significantly towards the prediction of health-related quality of life, psychological
distress, and somatic symptoms, over and above other established predictors, we conducted
three separate hierarchical linear regression analyses. In all of these analyses, gender, acne
severity, acne location and medication were entered at Step 1, while perceived stigma was
entered at Step 2. Hierarchical regression allows for the comparison of Step 1 and Step 2 mod-
els, so it is possible to determine if the change in R2 between models is significant. In addition,
the effect size of any change can be calculated. In the current study, we use Cohen’s f2 as an
indicator of effect size. Cohen advised that 0.02 represents a small effect size, 0.15 a medium
effect size, and 0.35 a large effect size [53].
In terms of how control variables were treated, given that both acne severity and acne loca-
tion had more than two categories, we generated dummy-coded variables to represent these
contrasts. Mild acne was utilized as the reference group for acne severity as it was the lowest
level of severity measured in the current study. Facial acne was selected as the reference group
for acne location as most participants in this study were affected by single-domain acne mani-
fested on the face [54].
Results
Preliminary analyses
A total of 472 people clicked the link to the online survey, of whom 276 completed the entire
survey (58.5% completion rate). As noted earlier, after initial data screening five participants
were excluded from further analyses. The assumptions of multivariate normality, linearity and
homoscedasticity were then tested and satisfied through analysis of the histograms, normal
P-P plots and scatterplots of the residuals. Although the scores for perceived stigma were posi-
tively skewed, transformation was not carried out due to large sample size and as all assump-
tions were satisfied [55]. We evaluated multicollinearity by assessing the tolerance statistic and
variance inflation factor. In accordance with O’Brien’s criteria [56], tolerance values exceeding
.10 and variance inflation factor values less than 5 were deemed acceptable—no issues with
multicollinearity were identified in the sample.
Descriptive statistics
The means, standard deviations, and intercorrelations between the measures are presented in
Table 1. Mean levels of perceived stigma were relatively low. The mean levels of health-related
quality of life impairment appear relatively high, with acne having a very large effect on the

 participants’ lives [57], although the fact we used a modified version of the DLQI means direct
comparisons should not be made. The mean levels of psychological distress would be consid-
ered normal to mild [50]. Although there are no classifications available for the PHQ, the
mean level was slightly under the midpoint of the scale and can therefore be viewed as
moderate.
As can be seen in Table 1, perceived stigma was significantly and positively associated with
all three well-being outcomes: health-related quality of life, psychological distress and somatic
symptoms. Therefore, acne sufferers that reported higher perceived stigma also reported
greater health-related quality of life impairment, higher psychological distress levels and more
somatic symptoms. In relation to the control variables, gender was found to be significantly
correlated with both health-related quality of life and somatic symptoms, with females
experiencing greater life quality impairment and more symptoms than males. Acne severity
was significantly correlated with health-related quality of life and psychological distress. Acne
location was not significantly correlated with health-related quality of life, psychological dis-
tress or somatic symptoms, indicating that the site of the participants’ acne is not associated
with well-being. Medication was significantly and positively correlated with health-related
quality of life, with individuals taking medication experiencing greater impairment than those
who were not.
Hierarchical regression analyses
As outlined in more detail above, three hierarchical multiple regression analyses were con-
ducted to examine our hypothesis that perceived stigma would add to the prediction of health-
related quality of life, psychological distress and somatic symptoms of acne sufferers after

tions of hierarchical multiple regression were tested and satisfied during preliminary analyses.
Perceived stigma predicting health-related quality of life. As hypothesized, the inclu-
sion of perceived stigma in the hierarchical regression model resulted in a significant increase
in explained variance of health-related quality of life after accounting for all other variables
(see Table 2). The overall regression model at Step 1 was statistically significant, F(6, 264) =
14.69, p < .001, accounting for 25.0% of variance in health-related quality of life. Gender, acne
severity, acne location and medication were all found to be significant predictors of health-
related quality of life.
The overall regression model at Step 2 was statistically significant, F(7, 263) = 39.98, p <
.001, explaining 51.6% of variance in health-related quality of life. The control variables that
were significant predictors of health-related quality of life at Step 1 remained significant at
Step 2. The introduction of perceived stigma explained an additional 26.5% of variance in
health-related quality of life and this change in R2 was statistically significant, F(1, 263) =
143.95, p < .001. The effect size for the addition of perceived stigma to the model was large
(Cohen’s f2 = .56). Perceived stigma was significantly and positively associated with higher
health-related quality of life, such that higher perceived stigma predicted higher levels of
health-related quality of life impairment; standardized β = .548, t(263) = 12.00, p < .001. Fur-
ther analyses demonstrated that perceived stigma made the largest unique contribution,
explaining 26.5% of the variance of health-related quality of life. By comparison, acne severity
accounted for 5.2%, gender accounted for 3.8%, acne location accounted for 2.5% and medica-
tion accounted for 1.9%. In sum, and as predicted, perceived stigma added to the prediction of
health-related quality of life of acne sufferers after statistically controlling for gender, acne
severity, acne location and medication. We conducted post-hoc power analysis using
G�Power, which showed the power to detect the observed effects at the .001 level was 1.00.
Perceived stigma predicting psychological distress. In line with our predictions, the
inclusion of perceived stigma led to a significant increase in explained variance of psychologi-
cal distress after accounting for all other variables (see Table 2). The overall regression model

 at Step 1 was statistically significant, F(6, 264) = 4.78, p < .001, accounting for 9.8% of variance
in psychological distress. Gender and acne severity were found to be significant predictors of
psychological distress. Acne location and medication were not statistically significant predic-
tors of psychological distress.
The overall regression model at Step 2 was statistically significant, F(7, 263) = 19.20, p <
.001, explaining 33.8% of variance in psychological distress. Gender and acne severity
remained significant at Step 2, in particular the mild vs. severe comparison. The introduction
of perceived stigma explained an additional 24.0% of variance in psychological distress and
this change in R2 was statistically significant, F(1, 263) = 95.50, p < .001. The effect size for the
addition of perceived stigma to the model was large (Cohen’s f2 = .36). Perceived stigma was
significantly and positively associated with higher psychological distress, such that higher per-
ceived stigma predicted higher levels of psychological distress; standardized β = .522, t(263) =
9.77, p < .001. Further analyses demonstrated that perceived stigma made the largest unique
contribution, explaining 24.0% of the variance of psychological distress. By comparison, gen-
der accounted for 3.0%, acne severity accounted for 1.1%, acne location accounted for 0.2%;
while medication did not uniquely explain additional variance in psychological distress. There-
fore, as hypothesized, perceived stigma added to the prediction of psychological distress of
acne sufferers after statistically controlling for gender, acne severity, acne location and medica-
tion. Post-hoc power analysis using G�Power showed the power to detect the observed effects
at the .001 level was 1.00.
Perceived stigma predicting somatic symptoms.
As predicted, the inclusion of perceived
stigma in the hierarchical regression model resulted in a significant increase in explained vari-
ance of somatic symptoms after accounting for all other variables (see Table 2). The overall
regression model at Step 1 was statistically significant, F(6, 264) = 4.56, p < .001, accounting
for 9.4% of variance in somatic symptoms. Gender, acne severity and medication were found
to be significant predictors of somatic symptoms. Acne location was not a statistically signifi-
cant predictor of somatic symptoms.
The overall regression model at Step 2 was statistically significant, F(7, 263) = 8.44, p <
.001, explaining 18.3% of variance in somatic symptoms. Gender and medication remained
significant at Step 2, though acne severity was rendered non-significant when perceived stigma
was also taken into account. The introduction of perceived stigma explained an additional
8.9% of variance in somatic symptoms and this change in R2 was statistically significant, F(1,
263) = 28.79, p < .001. The effect size for the addition of perceived stigma to the model was
small to medium (Cohen’s f2 = .11). Perceived stigma was significantly and positively associ-
ated with higher somatic symptoms, such that higher perceived stigma predicted a greater
number of somatic symptoms; standardized β = .318, t(263) = 5.37, p < .001. Further analyses
demonstrated that perceived stigma made the largest unique contribution, explaining 8.9% of
the variance of somatic symptoms. By comparison, gender accounted for 7.9%, medication
accounted for 1.2%, acne location accounted for 0.8% and acne severity accounted for 0.2%.
As such, and as predicted, perceived stigma added to the prediction of somatic symptoms of
acne sufferers after statistically controlling for gender, acne severity, acne location and medica-
tion. Using G�Power, we conducted post-hoc power analysis and found that the power to
detect the observed effects at the .001 level was .98.
Discussion
Previous research shows acne to be stigmatizing and to be associated with impaired quality of
life and other well-being outcomes. However, despite the established link between stigma and
impaired well-being in other samples, it has not previously been conclusively shown that

 stigmatization of acne helps to predict impaired well-being, over and above established demo-
graphic predictors. The present study addresses this gap by investigating whether acne suffer-
ers’ perceptions of stigmatization significantly predict psychological and physical health
outcomes; specifically health-related quality of life, psychological distress, and somatic symp-
toms. Acne sufferers at an Irish university completed online measures investigating perceived
stigma, health-related quality of life, psychological distress and somatic symptoms. As hypoth-
esized, higher levels of perceived stigma predicted greater impaired health-related quality of
life, psychological distress and somatic symptoms, over and above gender, acne severity, acne
location and medication. As such, the current study reinforces previous research investigating
the factors affecting the health-related quality of life of acne sufferers, and presents evidence
regarding the relevance of perceived stigma for the psychological distress and somatic symp-
toms experienced by this group.
Key findings
Our finding that perceived stigma significantly contributed to predicting impaired health-
related quality of life in acne sufferers, over and above the influence of all other variables, illus-
trates the importance of examining factors other than those typically associated with health-
related quality of life impairment in this group. Although the existing psychological and der-
matological literature investigating the health-related quality of life of acne sufferers is highly
informative, these results indicate that perceived stigma is also a highly important factor wor-
thy of greater consideration in future research. The current study reinforces findings from the
study by Liasides and Apergi [15], whereby perceived stigma was the largest contributor to the
health-related quality of life of acne sufferers, with factors such as gender and acne location
having secondary importance. The current study also provides novel evidence regarding the
respective contributions of gender, acne severity, acne location and use of medication to pre-
dicting health-related quality of life. Furthermore, our findings add to the relatively sparse lit-
erature investigating the association between stigmatization and the health-related quality of
life of individuals with visible skin conditions [25, 28–29].
Moving beyond health-related quality of life, the present study is the first to examine the
relation between stigmatization and anxiety/depression and physical health problems experi-
enced by acne sufferers. Indeed, the study by Liasides and Apergi [15] did not include anxiety/
depression or physical health as outcome measures, meaning our study both supports and
advances on their important findings relating to health-related quality of life. By focusing on
psychological distress and somatic symptoms, our findings therefore contribute meaningfully
to the literature on stigmatized identities more generally. In this literature, outcomes such as
psychological distress (and to a lesser extent, somatic symptoms) are quite common, but there
has not yet been a focus on groups such as acne sufferers. As such, the finding that greater per-
ceived stigma predicts higher levels of both psychological distress and somatic symptoms
extends previous research showing that acne sufferers experience anxiety and depression [49,
58] by accounting for the impact of stigma. The finding is also in line with previous research
demonstrating that stigmatized identities are linked with increased physical health problems
[33, 40, 59].
Importantly, the findings also provide further support for the comparatively limited
amount of studies investigating physical health problems experienced by acne sufferers. Partic-
ipants in the present study were found to experience similar levels of somatic symptoms to
other stigmatized groups (e.g., [35]), which reinforces recent research showing that acne suf-
ferers are likely to develop somatic symptoms other than those directly related to the skin con-
dition itself [7, 60], particularly if they feel stigmatized.

 It is also interesting to note the contribution of the current study to the understanding of
established predictors of impaired well-being outcomes in acne sufferers. In our study, as in
previous research [16–17], female participants were found to experience greater impairment
than males. It has previously been suggested that females encounter increased social pressure
to possess clear skin, and are consequently more concerned about the appearance of their acne
than males [61]. The study also reinforces previous work (e.g., [1], [18]) demonstrating that
increased acne severity contributes to decreased health-related quality of life, with individuals
that self-rated their acne as severe experiencing the highest impairment. Acne sufferers’ per-
ceptions of their acne severity are an indicator of self-confidence and body image satisfaction
[20], which in turn could have hindered health-related quality of life. Interestingly and in con-
trast to previous research [22], individuals with single-domain truncal acne experienced
greater health-related quality of life impairment than those with facial acne, suggesting that
decreased visibility did not result in decreased impairment. We speculate that this may be
because although truncal acne is largely concealable, it has nevertheless been linked with
greater self-consciousness of sexual and bodily appearance [61]. Finally, the results indicate
that participants taking medication experienced higher health-related quality of life
impairment than those who were not, possibly due to increased awareness of their condition.
Limitations and future directions
The present study addresses clear gaps in the literature on health-related quality of life in suf-
ferers of acne and other skin conditions, and in the stigmatized identities literature. However,
there are naturally several limitations that should be considered in future research. As this
study was cross-sectional in nature, it is not possible to make inferences about causality. In
order to discern causality, future research could investigate the effects of stigmatization and
factors influencing the health-related quality of life, psychological distress and somatic symp-
toms of acne sufferers on a longitudinal basis. It is also worth noting that the participants in
this study were university students recruited through convenience sampling. Previous research
has indicated that recruiting participants in this manner can lead to biased results, as univer-
sity students often have less-crystallized attitudes than individuals in later adulthood, as well as
greater cognitive abilities and stronger tendencies to comply with authority [62]. Similarly, the
relatively low completion rates could have led to non-response bias [63], while systematic
drop-out patterns can be influenced by survey design features and particular personality traits
[64].
Moreover, self-reported measures were employed to determine well-being and the nature
of acne. Self-reported measures can be influenced by factors such as social desirability and the
participants’ levels of stress and mood during completion [65]. As such, the results should be
evaluated with caution, as the participants self-diagnosed their acne and the extent of their
condition. Given that acne is a complex disease and manifests in various forms, the partici-
pants’ evaluations of their acne may have diverged from their actual clinical diagnosis. Future
research could diagnose acne severity more precisely through assessment via a global measure
such as the Leeds-Revised Acne Grading Scale [66]. It would also be useful to have participants
report specifically what type of medication they are using, if any, to control for this in a more
precise manner.
Although perceived stigma was observed to substantially predict the health outcomes mea-
sured in the current study, the mean levels of perceived stigma were relatively low. This may
not be considered surprising given the high pervasiveness of the condition and mild nature of
the symptoms in comparison to other facial deformities perceived negatively by society, such
as post-burn scarring and severe facial trauma [67]. Indeed, similar levels of stigma have been

 identified in previous research investigating the effects of stigma on psychological and physical
health (e.g., [33]).
The levels of perceived stigma could also be explained by participants’ ages, as previous
research has indicated that acne sufferers are subjected to less teasing and bullying as they
enter adulthood [6]. As such, we might see higher levels of perceived stigma in a sample of
teenage acne sufferers. Therefore, it is advisable that future research investigates this issue
using a more diverse age distribution. In addition, one study has suggested that individuals
without a previous history of acne are more likely to experience health-related quality of life
impairment due to their newly experienced symptoms [15]. Future research could investigate
the manner in which a sufferer’s history of acne and the duration of acne affects psychological
and physical health.
Further, while most participants self-rated their acne as mild or moderate, it should be
noted that acne severity was positively associated with higher levels of perceived stigma. As
such, in order to fully establish the degree to which stigmatization affects the psychological
and physical health of acne sufferers, future research could focus specifically on the impact of
perceived stigma on the health outcomes of sufferers with clinically severe acne as diagnosed
by medical professionals. It would also be possible to extend the results of the current study by
recruiting a sample with more varied experience in terms of acne location, as very few partici-
pants reported having single-domain truncal acne.
Finally, it was interesting that females were found to experience increased health-related
quality of life impairment and more somatic symptoms than males, and indeed this was con-
sistent with previous research. However, over two-thirds of the acne sufferers in our study
were female. This is perhaps unsurprising, given that females have been documented to be
afflicted more commonly by acne than males after adolescence [68]. However, ideally future
studies should investigate the effects of acne stigma with a sample including a greater number
of males, to establish more conclusively whether gender differences are apparent.
Conclusions and implications
The findings of the present study align with previous research showing that individuals with
visible distinctions viewed negatively by society are subjected to stigma, which is associated
with impaired psychological and physical well-being. In terms of theoretical implications, our
analyses further elucidate the important role of stigma in predicting the well-being of individu-
als with chronic skin conditions. Research on the health-related quality of life of acne sufferers
has tended to focus on demographical factors, and research on links between stigmatization
and well-being has largely focused on disadvantaged groups with more conspicuous visible
distinctions such as race [39] and obesity [40]. It is therefore significant for both these litera-
tures that our study indicates stigmatization contributes considerably to our understanding of
the well-being of acne sufferers, in terms of health-related quality of life, psychological distress
and somatic symptoms. To date, few studies have examined the association between stigma
and the psychological and physical health of this group, and thus the empirical evidence pre-
sented in the current study is both valuable and relevant.
The research also has considerable practical relevance and a number of notable clinical
implications. Our findings suggest that interventions that attempt to counter the effects of
stigma could improve the psychological and physical health of acne sufferers. For example,
introducing classes at primary level that teach strategies on how to cope with stigmatization
could prepare young people for the inevitable increase in the scrutiny of their physical appear-
ance as they enter adolescence. Similarly, workshops could be developed to help adult acne suf-
ferers cope with perceived stigmatization, which could in turn decrease health-related quality

 of life impairment, psychological distress and somatic symptoms. Additionally, medical pro-
fessionals and counsellors alike should place increased emphasis on social factors such as
stigma when selecting suitable methods for managing the consequences of the condition.
Although skin conditions are commonly overlooked as mere cosmetic problems, the symp-
toms experienced by sufferers are often unpredictable, difficult to manage, and can have a con-
siderable impact on self-esteem, body image and overall well-being. The current study
substantiates the large body of research demonstrating that acne sufferers are susceptible to an
array of health consequences due to their condition. Our findings illustrate the importance of
examining the potential influence of social factors such as stigma that have not received suffi-
cient attention in previous years. By developing a more complete understanding of the social
factors affecting acne sufferers, it could be possible to improve the techniques for managing
the diverse range of emotional and health consequences associated with the condition.
