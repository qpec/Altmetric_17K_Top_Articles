BACKGROUND
Fabry’s disease, an X-linked disorder of lysosomal α-galactosidase deficiency, leads 
to substrate accumulation in multiple organs. Migalastat, an oral pharmacologic 
chaperone, stabilizes specific mutant forms of α-galactosidase, increasing enzyme 
trafficking to lysosomes.
METHODS
The initial assay of mutant α-galactosidase forms that we used to categorize 67 pa-
tients with Fabry’s disease for randomization to 6 months of double-blind migalastat 
or placebo (stage 1), followed by open-label migalastat from 6 to 12 months (stage 2) 
plus an additional year, had certain limitations. Before unblinding, a new, validated 
assay showed that 50 of the 67 participants had mutant α-galactosidase forms suitable 
for targeting by migalastat. The primary end point was the percentage of patients who 
had a response (≥50% reduction in the number of globotriaosylceramide inclu-
sions per kidney interstitial capillary) at 6 months. We assessed safety along with 
disease substrates and renal, cardiovascular, and patient-reported outcomes.
RESULTS
The primary end-point analysis, involving patients with mutant α-galactosidase forms 
that were suitable or not suitable for migalastat therapy, did not show a significant 
treatment effect: 13 of 32 patients (41%) who received migalastat and 9 of 32 patients 
(28%) who received placebo had a response at 6 months (P 
= 
0.30). Among patients 
with suitable mutant α-galactosidase who received migalastat for up to 24 months, 
the annualized changes from baseline in the estimated glomerular filtration rate 
(GFR) and measured GFR were –0.30±0.66 and −1.51±1.33 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 
of body-surface area, respectively. The left-ventricular-mass index decreased signifi-
cantly from baseline (−7.7 g per square meter; 95% confidence interval [CI], −15.4 to 
–0.01), particularly when left ventricular hypertrophy was present (−18.6 g per square 
meter; 95% CI, −38.2 to 1.0). The severity of diarrhea, reflux, and indigestion decreased.
CONCLUSIONS
Among all randomly assigned patients (with mutant α-galactosidase forms that were 
suitable or not suitable for migalastat therapy), the percentage of patients who had 
a response at 6 months did not differ significantly between the migalastat group 
and the placebo group. (Funded by Amicus Therapeutics; ClinicalTrials.gov numbers,

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
F
abry’s disease is a rare, progressive, 
and devastating X-linked disorder caused 
by the functional deficiency of lysosomal 
α-galactosidase.1 The resultant accumulation of 
glycosphingolipids, predominantly globotriaosyl-
ceramide (GL-3), can lead to multisystem disease 
and early death.2
Binding of the pharmacologic chaperone mi-
galastat to the active site of α-galactosidase stabi-
lizes certain mutant enzymes, thus facilitating 
proper trafficking to lysosomes, where dissocia-
tion of migalastat allows α-galactosidase to ca-
tabolize accumulated substrates.3-7 In patients with 
mutant enzymes that are identified with the 
validated assay, orally administered migalastat 
may be an alternative treatment option for ad-
dressing certain unmet medical needs associated 
with enzyme-replacement therapy — for example, 
antibody formation to enzyme-replacement ther-
apy, which may exacerbate infusion-associated 
reactions and interfere with efficacy.8-10
As an orally administered small-molecule agent 
(see the Supplementary Appendix, available with 
the full text of this article at NEJM.org), migala-
stat may obviate the burden of lifelong admin-
istration of enzyme-replacement infusions every 
2 weeks and immunogenicity associated with 
enzyme-replacement therapy. The higher volume 
of distribution of migalastat (76.5 to 133 liters of 
total body water in adults)11 than of recombinant 
α-galactosidase12,13 hints at the possibility of bet-
ter diffusion in organs and tissues.4 Theoretically, 
chaperoning misfolded α-galactosidase to lyso-
somes may better mimic natural enzyme traffick-
ing and result in more consistent α-galactosidase 
activity than enzyme-replacement infusions every 
2 weeks. We now report the results of a phase 3 
study that evaluated the efficacy and safety of 
migalastat in male and female patients with 
Fabry’s disease.
Methods
Study Design
After eligibility had been determined and baseline 
assessments performed during a 2-month screen-
ing period, patients were randomly assigned to 
stage 1, which included 6 months of double-
blind administration of migalastat hydrochloride 
(150 mg) or placebo every other day. All patients 
who completed stage 1 were eligible to receive 
open-label migalastat in stage 2 (months 6 through 
12) and for an additional year (months 12 through 
24) thereafter (study AT1001-011) (Fig. S1 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). The primary objective 
was to compare the effect of migalastat with 
that of placebo on kidney GL-3 as assessed by 
histologic scoring of the number of inclusions in 
interstitial capillaries after 6 months of treatment. 
The secondary objectives of stage 1 were to com-
pare the effect of migalastat with that of placebo 
on urinary GL-3 levels, renal function, 24-hour 
urinary protein excretion, and safety and adverse 
events. The tertiary objectives were cardiac func-
tion, patient-reported outcomes, exploratory kid-
ney analyses, and α-galactosidase activity in white 
cells. Patients who completed the study were eli-
gible to enroll in the open-label study (AT1001-041) 
for up to 5 years.
Study Oversight
The studies were approved by the institutional 
review board or ethics committee at each partici-
pating center and were conducted in accordance 
with the International Conference on Harmoni-
sation Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the 
principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. All the 
patients provided written informed consent. A 
chartered data and safety monitoring board re-
viewed safety. The study (AT1001-011) was de-
signed by the authors, who vouch for the complete-
ness and accuracy of the data and analyses and 
for the fidelity of the study to the protocol. Data 
collection and analyses were undertaken by the 
sponsor (Amicus Therapeutics) in collaboration 
with a core group of investigators. The first draft 
of the manuscript was written by the first author 
and reviewed by all the authors. All the authors 
made the decision to submit the manuscript for 
publication. A full copy of the protocol and the 
statistical analysis plan is available at NEJM.org.
Patients
Eligible patients were 16 to 74 years of age and 
had genetically confirmed Fabry’s disease, had 
either never received enzyme-replacement therapy 
or had not received it for at least 6 months, had a 
mutation in the gene encoding α-galactosidase 
(GLA) resulting in a mutant protein that would 
respond to migalastat (see the following subsec-
tion), had an estimated glomerular filtration rate 
(GFR) of more than 30 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 
of body-surface area, and had a urinary GL-3 level 
at least four times the upper limit of the normal

range. Patients taking angiotensin-converting–
enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, 
or renin inhibitors had to have been on stable 
regimens of those medications for at least 4 weeks. 
We assessed the baseline globotriaosylsphingosine 
(lyso-Gb3) level, baseline residual α-galactosidase 
activity (in male patients), and number of organ 
systems with Fabry’s disease involvement on the 
basis of the patients’ baseline measurements and 
medical history (see the Methods section in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
Determination of Potentially Suitable 
Mutant α-Galactosidase
Enrollment required patients to have responsive 
mutant α-galactosidase forms on the basis of the 
assay available at the start of the study. This assay 
used human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells 
into which GLA complementary DNA from indi-
vidual patients was transfected and compared with 
wild-type α-galactosidase after exposure to mig-
alastat.14 However, whether a given mutant enzyme 
would respond was ultimately determined by test-
ing with an assay that became available after the 
study had begun, which we have termed the Mig-
alastat “Amenability” Assay, a Good Laboratory 
Practice (GLP)–validated HEK assay. That assay 
includes several modifications to increase the qual-
ity and rigor of the test, including more rigorous 
plasmid DNA quality-control assessments and 
storage specifications (see the Methods section 
in the Supplementary Appendix). Testing was 
completed before unblinding of the stage 1 data. 
The criteria for potentially suitable mutant pro-
teins were identical in the two assays. We have 
referred to mutations that resulted in enzymes 
meeting the GLP-validated HEK assay criteria as 
“amenable” (suitable).
Assessment of Renal Histologic Features
Each patient underwent a baseline kidney biopsy 
and repeat kidney biopsies at 6 months and 12 
months. The number of GL-3 inclusions per kidney 
interstitial capillary per patient at baseline and 
at 6 and 12 months was assessed quantitatively15 
in 300 capillaries by three independent patholo-
gists who were unaware of the study medication 
and study visit. All values for each individual 
biopsy at a given time were averaged before sta-
tistical analysis. The same three pathologists qual-
itatively assessed GL-3 changes in podocytes, en-
dothelial cells, and mesangial cells, as well as 
glomerular sclerosis, in the same blinded fashion 
(see the Methods section in the Supplementary 
Appendix).
Lyso-Gb3 and GL-3
Plasma lyso-Gb3 levels and 24-hour urine GL-3 
levels were analyzed by means of liquid chro-
matography–mass spectroscopy. This involved 
a new stable-isotope–labeled internal standard, 
13C6-lyso-Gb3 (lower limit of quantification, 
0.200 ng per milliliter, or 0.254 nmol per liter).16,17
Renal-Function Assessment
The estimated GFR was determined with the use 
of the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Col-
laboration equation,18 and the measured GFR was 
determined by iohexol clearance.19 Annualized 
rates of change from baseline were calculated. 
(For details, see the Methods section in the Sup-
plementary Appendix.)
Echocardiography
The left-ventricular-mass index, end-diastolic left 
ventricular posterior wall thickness, end-diastolic 
interventricular septum thickness, and other echo-
cardiographic measures were assessed through 
blinded, centralized evaluation. The baseline visit 
of extension study AT1001-041 was used as the 
last assessment (see the Methods section in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
Patient-Reported Outcomes
Patient-reported outcomes were assessed with 
the use of the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating 
Scale,20 the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item 
Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36), version 2,21 
and the pain-severity component of the Brief 
Pain Inventory–Short Form.22 (For more on these 
assessments, see the Methods section in the 
Supplementary Appendix.)
Safety Analysis and Adverse Events
Patients who had received at least one dose of 
study medication were included in the safety 
analysis. Safety outcomes were vital signs, phys-
ical-examination findings, electrocardiographic 
results, clinical laboratory measurements, and 
adverse events.
Statistical Analysis
The intention-to-treat (ITT) population consisted 
of the 67 randomly assigned patients. The primary

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
stage 1 (6-month) end point, assessed in the ITT 
population by means of baseline biopsy samples 
(in 64 patients), was the percentage of patients 
in the migalastat and placebo groups with a de-
crease of 50% or more in the number of GL-3 
inclusions per kidney interstitial capillary. Two 
other stage 1 end points were assessed in the 
modified ITT population (60 randomly assigned 
patients with paired baseline and month 6 biopsy 
samples): percent change in GL-3 inclusions per 
kidney interstitial capillary and percent of kidney 
interstitial capillaries with no GL-3 inclusions. 
Efficacy analyses for GL-3 inclusions per kidney 
interstitial capillary and other prespecified end 
points in stage 2 (months 6 through 12) and the 
open-label extension (months 12 through 24) 
were based on the ITT population with mutant 
α-galactosidase enzyme shown to be suitable for 
migalastat treatment by the validated assay (50 pa-
tients). Changes from baseline were considered to 
be significant if the 95% confidence intervals did 
not include zero or if the P values were less than 
0.05. Additional statistical methods are provided 
in the Supplementary Appendix.
Results
Baseline Characteristics
A total of 67 patients (64% female) with poten-
tially responsive mutant α-galactosidase under-
went randomization (ITT population) (Fig. S1 
and Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
There were no significant differences in baseline 
characteristics between the migalastat group and 
the placebo group among the 50 patients in the 
ITT population with suitable mutant α-galac 
to 
s 
i-
dase (Table 1).
Published reports of clinical phenotypes as-
sociated with the genotypes of the 50 patients 
with suitable mutations indicate that 30 (60%) 
had mutations associated with the classic phe-
notype of Fabry’s disease, 1 (2%) had mutations 
associated with the nonclassic phenotype, 3 (6%) 
had mutations associated with both phenotypes, 
and 16 (32%) had mutations that were not yet 
classified (Tables S2 and S3 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix). Residual activity of α-galactosi-
dase in white cells of less than 3% was found in 
14 of 16 male patients (87%); 29 of 31 male and 
female patients (94%) had elevated plasma lyso-
Gb3 levels, and 47 of 50 male and female patients 
(94%) had Fabry’s disease involvement in at least 
two organ systems (Tables S4A and S4B in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
GL-3 in Kidney Interstitial Capillaries
In the 6-month primary end-point analysis (ITT 
population), 13 of 32 patients (41%) who received 
migalastat and 9 of 32 patients (28%) who re-
ceived placebo had a response (≥50% reduction 
in the number of GL-3 inclusions per kidney in-
terstitial capillary) (P 
= 
0.30). The median change 
in interstitial capillary GL-3 from baseline was 
−40.8% with migalastat and −5.6% with placebo 
(P 
= 
0.10). The mean difference for the change in 
the percentage of interstitial capillaries with no 
GL-3 inclusions was 7.3 percentage points in favor 
of migalastat (P 
= 
0.04).
In stage 1 (6-month) post hoc analysis and 
stage 2 (12-month) prespecified analysis in 45 
patients with suitable mutant α-galactosidase, 
6 months of migalastat was associated with a 
significantly greater reduction in the mean (±SE) 
number of GL-3 inclusions per kidney interstitial 
capillary than was placebo: −0.25±0.10 versus 
0.07±0.13; P 
= 
0.008 (Fig. 1, and Table S5 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). The reduction in inter-
stitial capillary GL-3 at 6 months remained sta-
ble after an additional 6 months of treatment. A 
significant reduction in the mean number of 
GL-3 inclusions per kidney interstitial capillary 
was observed at 12 months in patients who 
switched from placebo to migalastat at 6 months 
(−0.33±0.15, P 
= 
0.01). Patients with mutant 
α-galac 
tosi 
dase that was not suitable for migala-
stat therapy according to the validated assay did 
not show any treatment effect in interstitial 
capillary GL-3 (Table S6 in the Supplementary 
Appendix).
GL-3 in Glomerular Cells
On the basis of qualitative assessments of 23 kid-
ney biopsy samples after 12 months of migalastat, 
patients with responsive mutant α-galactosidase 
showed decreases in GL-3 in glomerular podo-
cytes (5 of 23 samples, 22%), endothelial cells (6 of 
23 samples, 26%), and mesangial cells (11 of 23 
samples, 48%). None of the samples had increas-
es; the remaining samples showed no significant 
change.

mutant α-galactosidase, 6 months of migalastat 
was associated with a significantly lower plasma 
lyso-Gb3 level than was 6 months of placebo 
(P 
= 
0.003) (Fig. 2, and Table S7 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix). Plasma lyso-Gb3 levels remained 
stable without further reduction after 6 addi-
tional months of migalastat. In patients switch-
ing from placebo to migalastat at 6 months, a 
significant reduction in plasma lyso-Gb3 levels 
was observed between month 6 and month 12 
(P<0.001) (Fig. 2, and Table S7 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix). Plasma levels in patients with 
mutant α-galactosidase that was not suitable for 
migalastat therapy were unchanged (Table S8 in 
the Supplementary Appendix).
 
Urinary GL-3 Substrate
In patients with suitable mutant α-galactosidase, 
the mean (±SE) change in the 24-hour urinary 
GL-3 substrate concentration from baseline to 
month 6 was −361±169 ng per milligram of cre-
atinine with migalastat (concentration at month 
6, 555±151) and −147±217 ng per milligram of 
creatinine with placebo (concentration at month 
6, 1017±218) (P 
= 
0.44).
 
Kidney Function
In the modified ITT population with suitable 
mutant α-galactosidase, there were no signifi-
cant between-group differences in the change in 
estimated GFR or measured GFR from baseline 
to month 6 (see the Results section in the Sup-
plementary Appendix). In patients followed for 
up to 24 months of migalastat, the mean (±SE) 
annualized changes from baseline in estimated 
GFR and measured GFR (±SE) were −0.30±0.66 
and −1.51±1.33 ml per minute per 1.73 m2, re-
spectively. Male sex and a higher 24-hour uri-
nary protein excretion at baseline were associ-
ated with a higher rate of annual decline (Table 
S9 in the Supplementary Appendix). There were 
no significant differences in baseline levels or 
changes from baseline between study groups for 
24-hour urinary protein excretion (Table S10 in 
the Supplementary Appendix).
 
Echocardiographic Variables
At baseline, the left-ventricular-mass index was 
similar in the migalastat and placebo groups; there 
were no significant differences during stage 1 
(Tables S11 and S12 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix). In patients in the ITT population with 
Figure 1. Change from Baseline in Kidney Interstitial Capillary Globotriao-
sylceramide (GL-3) in Patients with Mutant α-Galactosidase Forms That 
Were Suitable for Migalastat Therapy.
Baseline values were normalized to zero, and data represent the mean 
change from baseline or from month 6. An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) 
model with covariate adjustment for baseline value and factors for treat-
ment group and treatment-by-baseline interaction was used for the change 
from baseline to month 6; the P value of 0.008 corresponds to the least-
squares mean difference between migalastat and placebo. A mixed-effects 
model for repeated measures was used for the change from month 6 to 
month 12 in patients switching from placebo to migalastat. The model 
used fixed effects for treatment group and time, time-by-treatment interac-
tion, and baseline GL-3 inclusions. I bars indicate standard errors.

Treatment of Fabry’s Disease with Migalastat
suitable mutant α-galactosidase who received 
migalastat for up to 24 months, a significant 
decrease in the left-ventricular-mass index was 
observed overall, with a trend toward a larger 
reduction in patients with left ventricular hyper-
trophy at baseline (Table 2). The annualized rate 
of change from baseline to month 24 is provided 
in Table S13 in the Supplementary Appendix.
The end-diastolic interventricular septum thick-
ness changed by −0.06±0.05 cm (95% confidence 
interval, −1.67 to 0.04) from the baseline value 
of 1.17±0.06 cm, representing a decrease of 5.2%; 
the end-diastolic left ventricular posterior wall 
thickness was stable for up to 24 months (Table 
S14 in the Supplementary Appendix). The changes 
in the left-ventricular-mass index correlated with 
changes in the intraventricular septum thick-
ness (R2 
= 
0.26, P 
= 
0.006) but not with changes 
in the left ventricular posterior wall thickness 
(R2 
= 
0.06, P 
= 
0.23).
Gastrointestinal Symptoms
Among migalastat-treated patients in the ITT 
population with suitable mutant α-galactosidase, 
symptoms decreased in three domains (diar-
rhea, reflux, and indigestion) of five domains in 
the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (Ta-
ble S15 in the Supplementary Appendix). For the 
diarrhea domain, between baseline and month 6 
(stage 1), there was a significant decrease in symp-
toms (P 
= 
0.03); a nonsignificant decrease was 
observed among patients who had symptoms at 
baseline (P 
= 
0.06). Significant changes over a 
period of 24 months were observed for patients 
with or without baseline symptoms.
There was a significant improvement in the re-
flux domain during stage 1 in patients in the ITT 
population with suitable mutant α-galactosidase 
who had baseline symptoms (P 
= 
0.047). Signifi-
cant changes over 24 months were observed in 
the indigestion domain for patients with or with-
out baseline symptoms. There was a trend to-
ward improvement in the constipation domain.

ponent of the Brief Pain Inventory–Short Form 
are provided in the Results section in the Supple-
mentary Appendix.
Safety and Adverse Events
During stage 1, adverse events that emerged after 
the initiation of a study medication were similar 
in the migalastat and placebo groups. Adverse 
events with a higher frequency among patients 
receiving migalastat than among those receiving 
placebo were headache (12 of 34 patients [35%] 
vs. 7 of 33 patients [21%]) and nasopharyngitis 
(6 of 34 patients [18%] vs. 2 of 34 patients [6%]). 
The most frequently reported adverse events dur-
ing stage 2 were headache (9 of 63 patients [14%]) 
and procedural pain (7 of 63 patients [11%] re-
lated to kidney biopsies) during stage 2 and 
proteinuria (9 of 57 patients [16%]), headache

(6 of 57 patients [11%]), and bronchitis (6 of 57 
patients [11%]) during the open-label extension. 
Most adverse events were mild or moderate in 
severity (Table 3). No adverse events led to the 
discontinuation of migalastat. Additional safety 
data are provided in Tables S16 through S18 in 
the Supplementary Appendix.
Serious adverse events were reported in 7 pa-
tients during stage 1 (5 in the migalastat group 
and 2 in the placebo group), 5 during stage 2, and 
11 during the open-label extension. Two serious 
adverse events were assessed by the investigator 
as being possibly related to migalastat: fatigue and 
paresthesia. Both occurred in the same patient 
between months 12 and 24, and both resolved. No 
individual serious adverse event was reported by 
more than 1 patient. Two patients discontinued 
migalastat owing to serious adverse events; both 
events were deemed to be unrelated to migala-
stat. No deaths were reported. All serious adverse 
events and their possible association with a 
study medication are provided in Table 4.
Proteinuria that emerged after the initiation 
of a study medication was reported in 9 of 57 pa-
tients (16%) between months 12 and 24; one case 
of proteinuria was judged to be migalastat-relat-
ed. In 5 patients, the 24-month values were in the 
same range as the baseline values. Three patients 
with suitable mutant α-galactosidase had overt 
proteinuria (urinary protein excretion of >1 g per 
24 hours) at baseline, which worsened over a 
period of 24 months. In 23 of 28 patients who 
had a urinary protein excretion of 300 mg or less 
per 24 hours at baseline, the urinary protein ex-
cretion remained stable during migalastat treat-
ment (Table S19 in the Supplementary Appendix).
No patients had progression to end-stage re-
nal disease, cardiac death, or stroke, as defined 
by Banikazemi et al.23 There was a single case of 
transient ischemic attack, which was judged to 
be unrelated to migalastat. Analyses of vital signs, 
physical-examination findings, clinical laboratory 
measurements, and electrocardiographic results 
did not reveal any clinically relevant effect of 
migalastat.
Discussion
Migalastat, the oral pharmacologic chaperone 
administered in this study, has a unique mecha-
nism of action. The stabilization of suitable 
mutant forms of α-galactosidase by migalastat is 
hypothesized to increase enzyme levels more 
consistently than enzyme-replacement therapy 
given every 2 weeks. The higher volume of dis-
tribution of migalastat than of enzyme replace-
ment11 suggests that migalastat may enhance 
α-galactosidase levels in multiple organs, includ-
ing the central nervous system.4 Migalastat, a 
low-molecular-weight iminosugar, would be ex-
pected to have a low burden of treatment24 and 
would avoid the risk of the immunogenicity re-
actions and complications associated with en-
zyme-replacement therapy.10
The accumulation of GL-3 in different kidney 
cells is a known consequence of Fabry’s disease.1 
Plasma lyso-Gb3 has become recognized as an 
important marker of disease severity.25,26 Al-

Treatment of Fabry’s Disease with Migalastat
though the primary analysis for interstitial cap-
illary GL-3 in stage 1 (baseline to month 6) in 
patients with mutant α-galactosidase forms that 
were suitable or not suitable for migalastat 
therapy did not show a significant treatment ef-
fect, post hoc stage 1 and prespecified stage 2 
(month 6 through 12) analyses in patients with 
suitable mutations provide evidence of a signifi-
cant and durable reduction in kidney GL-3 levels. 
Tertiary analyses in this population also indi-
cated that migalastat treatment was associated 
with reductions in plasma lyso-Gb3 levels. Using 
a qualitative method, we found substrate reduc-
tions in other types of kidney cells. No changes 
in substrate levels were observed in samples from 
patients with mutant α-galactosidase forms that 
were not suitable for migalastat therapy. The clear 
difference in effect on substrate in patients with 
suitable versus nonsuitable mutations supports 
the accuracy and predictive value of the GLP-
validated HEK assay in identifying patients with 
GLA mutations who will have a response to mig-
alastat.
Progressive decline in renal function is a ma-
jor complication of Fabry’s disease.27,28 In stage 1 
(baseline to month 6), there was no significant 
difference in the annualized rate of change in 
GFR between patients who received migalastat 
and those who received placebo; this observation 
period, however, was not sufficiently long to 
assess differences in GFR between groups. After 
up to 24 months (prespecified end point in stage 2 
and open-label extension), the annualized rates of 
change in estimated GFR among migalastat-
treated patients with amenable mutations at all 
baseline levels of urinary protein excretion were 
less than the decline in estimated GFR in pub-
lished cohorts of untreated patients.28,29 We bal-
anced the baseline characteristics of patients in 
our study with those of the published cohorts for 
sex, renal function, and urinary protein excretion. 
Other variables not reported in the published co-
horts (e.g., kidney GL-3) may have differed, thus 
limiting the comparisons. Male sex and higher 
urinary protein excretion are key predictive fac-
tors for more rapid progression of Fabry nephrop-
athy, frequently resulting in dialysis or end-stage 
renal disease.30 The changes that we observed in 
24-hour urinary protein excretion were similar 
to those reported for patients treated with en-
zyme-replacement therapy.31 Our results suggest 
that treatment with migalastat, as compared with 
no treatment, improved renal function in both 
male and female patients with Fabry’s disease at 
all levels of urinary protein excretion.
Cardiac complications are common and the 
main cause of death in Fabry’s disease.32 The most 
frequent cardiac manifestation is left ventricular 
hypertrophy,33 an important risk factor for car-
diac events.34,35 Reduction of left ventricular mass 
has been shown to improve outcomes in these 
patients.36 Migalastat treatment for up to 24 
months significantly reduced the left-ventricu-

lar-mass index, with larger decreases observed 
in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy at 
baseline. These findings suggest that the effects 
of migalastat on the left-ventricular-mass index 
compare favorably with those observed for en-
zyme-replacement therapy; the effect of enzyme-
replacement therapy on left ventricular mass 
may be inconsistent or diminish over time.33,35,36 
This reduction in the left-ventricular-mass index 
by migalastat may contribute to a decrease in 
cardiac complications that are common in Fabry’s 
disease,33-35 but further study is warranted.
Patients with Fabry’s disease frequently have 
debilitating gastrointestinal symptoms.37,38 Six 
months of double-blind migalastat was associ-
ated with improvement in the diarrhea domain 
of the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale as 
compared with placebo. Improvements were seen 
in several of the domains over 24 months. These 
migalastat-associated improvements may have a 
long-term positive effect on quality of life, but 
this observation requires further study.
There were no discontinuations of migalastat 
owing to adverse events related to migalastat 
during the study. No patients had progression to 
end-stage renal disease, had strokes, or died from 
cardiac causes during the study.
In conclusion, among patients with mutant 
α-galactosidase forms that were suitable or not 
suitable for migalastat therapy, the percentage of 
patients who had a decrease of 50% or more in 
the number of GL-3 inclusions per kidney inter-
stitial capillary at 6 months did not differ sig-
nificantly between the migalastat group and the 
placebo group.
