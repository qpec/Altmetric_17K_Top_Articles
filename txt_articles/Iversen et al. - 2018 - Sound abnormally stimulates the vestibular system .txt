Sound abnormally stimulates 
the vestibular system in canal 
dehiscence syndrome by 
generating pathological  
fluid-mechanical waves

Individuals suffering from Tullio phenomena experience dizziness, vertigo, and reflexive eye 
movements (nystagmus) when exposed to seemingly benign acoustic stimuli. The most common cause 
is a defect in the bone enclosing the vestibular semicircular canals of the inner ear. Surgical repair often 
corrects the problem, but the precise mechanisms underlying Tullio phenomenon are not known. In 
the present work we quantified the phenomenon in an animal model of the condition by recording 
fluid motion in the semicircular canals and neural activity evoked by auditory-frequency stimulation. 
Results demonstrate short-latency phase-locked afferent neural responses, slowly developing sustained 
changes in neural discharge rate, and nonlinear fluid pumping in the affected semicircular canal. 
Experimental data compare favorably to predictions of a nonlinear computational model. Results 
identify the biophysical origin of Tullio phenomenon in pathological sound-evoked fluid-mechanical 
waves in the inner ear. Sound energy entering the inner ear at the oval window excites fluid motion at 
the location of the defect, giving rise to traveling waves that subsequently excite mechano-electrical 
transduction in the vestibular sensory organs by vibration and nonlinear fluid pumping.
Babylonian tablets scribed in the second millennium BC describe symptoms of vertigo, nystagmus, nausea and 
loss of balance – often disabling conditions attributed at the time to demonic possession rather than biology1,2. It 
was not until the Greek Hippocratic Corpus that consideration moved from demons to derangements of normal 
physiology to explain neuropsychiatric phenomena, clearing the path to establish a scientific understanding of 
balance disorders. The first key discoveries were made in the mid 19th century when Pierre Flourens and Prosper 
Ménière identified the inner ear semicircular canals (SCC) as the sensory organs responsible for angular motion 
sensation, and Josef Breuer identified the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) as responsible for compensatory eye 
movements that stabilize the visual image on the retina by counteracting head movements3,4. Normally, SCC 
afferent neurons exclusively encode and transmit angular head motion information to the brain, but become 
pathologically sensitive to linear acceleration, vibration, atmospheric pressure, and airborne sound if the tempo-
ral bone encasing the vestibular labyrinth is compromised by a fistula or dehiscence. SCC vestibular sensitivity to 
sound is referred to as Tullio phenomenon, named after Pietro Tullio who discovered that creating a fistula in the 
bony labyrinth leads to pathological SCC vestibular responses to sound5. Patients suffering from Tullio phenom-
enon experience severe symptoms of sound-induced vertigo and ocular nystagmus. Lloyd Minor and colleagues6 
identified dehiscence of the superior canal bony labyrinth as the most common cause, which has led to successful 
methods for diagnosis and surgical repair7. But precisely why a fistula or dehiscence of the bony enclosure leads 
to Tullio phenomenon has remained a mystery for millennia.

Tullio phenomenon is characterized by sound-evoked nystagmus, with the eyes beating primarily in the plane 
of the affected canal7–10. Sound-evoked eye movements are similar to those evoked in normal subjects by con-
tinuous angular acceleration of the head, demonstrating that sound evokes tonic semicircular canal responses in 
these subjects. Recordings from SCC afferent neurons after generating a small fistula in the bony labyrinth have 
revealed two characteristic types of pathological neural responses to pure tones: (1) neurons that lock action 
potential timing to a specific phase of the sinusoidal sound wave (phase-locking), and (2) neurons that increase 
or decrease action potential discharge rate during the sound stimulus without phase-locking (rate encoding)11. 
Phase-locking occurs primarily in neurons that fire action potentials with irregular inter-spike intervals, while 
rate encoding primarily occurs in neurons that that fire action potentials with regular inter-spike intervals12–14. 
The low-frequency VOR relies primarily on inputs from regularly discharging afferent neurons driving the “sus-
tained” vestibular system15, while the high-frequency phasic VOR also relies on irregular phase-locking afferent 
neural inputs driving the “transient” system13,16. Understanding how sound evokes inappropriate sustained and 
phase-locked vestibular inputs to the brain is therefore essential to understanding eye movements and origins of 
Tullio phenomenon.
A fistula or dehiscence is thought to give rise to Tullio phenomenon by introducing a flexible window in the 
bony labyrinth that diverts sound energy away from the cochlea and toward the affected canal5,17. The temporal 
bone encasing the inner ear normally has only two flexible windows, both located in the middle ear. The oval 
window transmits sound from the middle ear stapes to the cochlea, while the round window is the pressure relief 
point. Introduction of a flexible “third window” diverts acoustic energy away from the cochlea and round win-
dow toward the affected semicircular canal, and this energy shunt explains hearing loss for air-conducted sounds 
caused by the condition18,19. The third mobile window also relieves pressure in the perilymph at the point of the 
fistula, thereby leading to a transmembrane pressure difference between endolymph and perilymph that can 
deform the membranous labyrinth, producing flow of endolymph that deflects sensory hair bundles in the SCC 
crista. This mechanism likely contributes to pressure and low-frequency infrasound sensitivity6,20, but cannot 
account for sustained responses of afferent neurons to auditory frequency sound, nor can it account for frequency 
dependence of the magnitude and direction of eye movements. It has been suggested in previous studies of Tullio 
phenomena that nonlinear wave-driven fluid streaming21 or Liebau impedance pumping22–24 might underlie sus-
tained responses to sound. The work of Grieser et al.21 presents strong theoretical arguments that Tullio phe-
nomena likely has origins in wave mechanics and nonlinear endolymph pumping in the deformable labyrinth. 
But sound-evoked neural responses measured in animal models and eye movements measured in humans show 
frequency dependent changes in excitation vs. inhibition that that are not described by current theories.
In the present work we combine theory and experiment to examine the hypothesis that traveling waves in 
the vestibular labyrinth give rise to phase-locked afferent neural responses by vibrating sensory hair bundles 
cycle-by-cycle, and give rise to sustained changes in afferent discharge rate by frequency dependent pumping of 
endolymph. Computational modeling of the human labyrinth25 was performed to elucidate biomechanics of the 
phenomena, and results were used to design specific experiments to confirm biophysics of the phenomena in an 
animal model. Experiments were performed in the oyster toadfish, Opsanus tau, an animal model selected to 
facilitate in vivo recording of afferent neurons and endolymph flow26, and to provide reasonable morphological 
similarity to human27.
Experimental data shows steady endolymph pumping in the semicircular canals evoked by auditory frequency 
stimuli, as well as sustained afferent neuron responses to sound. The direction and magnitude were both fre-
quency dependent, exhibiting multiple peaks and valleys in the auditory frequency spectrum. Results are con-
sistent with mathematical analysis of nonlinear canal biomechanics and explain the origin of both sustained and 
transient vestibular responses in subjects suffering from Tullio phenomena.
Results
To gain insight into the potential mechanical origin of Tullio phenomenon we used the finite element method 
(FEM) to simulate fluid motion and tissue deformation in the vestibular labyrinth. We constructed a simple 
FEM model based on the geometry of the human superior canal (Fig. 1A, SC) with a dehiscence (D) in the bone 
located half way around the loop. Endolymph and perilymph were modeled using the nonlinear Navier-Stokes 
equations and the membranous duct was modeled as a linear elastic tube. The morphology was simplified to an 
endolymph-filled elastic tube inside a rigid perilymph-filled bony tube (Fig. 1A,i). A pure tone acoustic pressure 
(1 A i, black arrows) was applied in the perilymph near the oval window (1 A. OW). Simulations predict the 
presence of traveling waves (TW), propagating away from the location of dehiscence and toward the location of 
acoustic stimulation Po (See Supplemental Video 1). Waves always traveled away from the dehiscence site and 
toward the pressure stimulus. This reverse propagation occurs because conservation of mass in the bony laby-
rinth forces the fluid displacement to be much larger near the small dehiscence relative to fluid displacement in 
the larger vestibule. Nearly identical results were obtained in our finite element model by applying a prescribed 
volume displacement at the site of the dehiscence and allowing pressure relief in perilymph at the round window., 
Hence, because the fluid is essentially incompressible, the mechanics can be examined using a volume velocity 
stimulus at the round window or an equivalent volume velocity at the dehiscence. This reciprocity motivated our 
animal model configuration using auditory frequency indentation in the membranous duct to induce endolymph 
volume velocity at the site of a simulated dehiscence.
Based on FEM simulations we hypothesized that traveling waves give rise to phase-locked afferent responses 
by vibrating sensory hair bundles as the waves pass through the ampulla, and give rise to sustained afferent 
responses by sustained pumping of endolymph in the direction of wave propagation. Cycle-by-cycle vibration 
of hair bundles is clearly supported by the simple FEM model (Fig. 1A,i), but in order for sustained pumping to 
occur in a preferred direction (e.g. counter clockwise, ampullofugal vs. clockwise, ampullopetal) there must be 
some asymmetry in the morphology that allows one of the two traveling waves to dominate. To investigate this

idea we used the morphologically-descriptive 1-D model of Iversen and Rabbitt25 to analyze endolymph pump-
ing. In Fig. 2 the spatial distribution of the sustained component of endolymph pressure caused by nonlinear fluid 
pumping is shown as a color map and the vibrational component of the transmembrane pressure is displayed in 
the polar plot. Like the FEM model, waves are predicted by the 1-D model to travel away from the site of simu-
lated dehiscence (Fig. 2) toward the vestibule (See Supplemental Videos 2–3). However, due to the asymmetric 
geometry, traveling waves on one side of the dehiscence dominate, leading to sustained endolymph pumping in a 
frequency-dependent preferred direction. The reason why one side can dominate is illustrated in Fig. 2C (790 Hz, 
lower panel), where the ampullopetal wave reflects as it travels toward the utricle leading to standing waves (SW) 
while the ampullofugal wave propagates with less reflection. This causes net fluid pumping in the ampullofugal

direction. Local reflection of traveling waves is caused by variations in the acoustic-wave impedance introduced 
by local changes in membranous duct cross-sectional area. The stiffness of the cupula is unimportant relative to 
fluid mass, fluid viscosity, and membranous duct elasticity for auditory frequency stimuli25. Since the wavelength 
is frequency dependent and the vibrational patterns are frequency dependent25, the direction and magnitude of 
nonlinear endolymph pumping also depend on frequency.
If the theoretical predictions in Figs 1 and 2 underlie Tullio phenomena in the living ear, we hypothesized 
it would be possible to generate both phase-locked afferent responses and frequency-dependent sustained 
responses in a simple animal model. To test this hypothesis, we recorded single-unit responses of afferent neu-
rons and endolymph fluid velocity evoked by auditory frequency stimuli. The oyster toadfish lateral canal (LC) 
with a simulated dehiscence (Fig. 1B, SD) was used to facilitate in vivo neural recordings and particle imaging 
velocimetry (PIV)28. As expected from simulations, afferent neurons exhibited both phase-locked and sustained 
responses, depending on the specific neuron and frequency tested. Four examples of phase-locked responses are 
shown in Fig. 3 for stimuli at 422, 500 and 800 Hz. Notice that these afferents had a rapid onset consistent with 
the rapid wave propagation from the site of the simulated dehiscence to the ampulla. Phase-locked units also 
exhibited some adaptation during the stimulus, followed by slow recovery after the stimulus, both consistent with 
slow endolymph pumping superimposed on the vibration. Consistent with previous reports in this species, SCC 
afferents that phase-locked to auditory frequency stimuli had irregular baseline inter-spike-intervals, as quanti-
fied for this specific population by their high coefficient of variation of 0.40 +/−
 0.1914. These units phase-locked 
to the stimulus with high vector strength 0.85 +/−
 0.11 and winding ratios between 2–5.
Responses of regularly discharging afferent neurons did not phase-lock to the auditory frequency stimulus 
but, instead, showed slow changes in discharge rate consistent with those observed during sustained cupula 
deflections26,29. Four examples are provided in Fig. 4 to stimuli at 422, 500 and 850 Hz (Fig. 4A–D). Notice, like 
the simulations, sensitivity was either excitatory or inhibitory depending on the stimulus frequency. Afferents 
that exhibited sustained responses without strong phase-locking had regular baseline inter-spike-intervals 
with a low average coefficient of variation of 0.05 +/−
 0.008. These units responded with low vector strengths 
of 0.34 +/−
 0.25 as expected for regularly discharging afferents14,30. One afferent in Fig. 4B responded with 
mixed-type behavior and phase-locked at decreasing winding ratios during the stimulus onset until reaching 
a sustained increase in firing rate at k = 3. Responses recovered with approximately the same time constant

irrespective of the unit, 15.04 +/−
 1.14 s, which reflects the mechanical time constant governing recovery of the 
cupula to its resting position with very modest neural adaptation in regularly discharging afferents. Whether the 
response to the auditory frequency stimulus in regularly discharging afferents was excitatory vs. inhibitory was 
frequency dependent, but not dependent on the specific neuron tested. To further illustrate frequency depend-
ence, the change in firing rate of an example unit is shown in Fig. 4E in response to auditory-frequency stimu-
lation from ~300–3000 Hz. These results are consistent with the hypothesis of frequency-dependent sustained 
cupula displacement caused by endolymph pumping.
To determine if auditory frequency stimuli indeed generate sustained endolymph pumping, we injected flu-
orescent microspheres into the endolymph through a small fistula in the membranous labyrinth and measured 
endolymph flow using PIV. For these experiments we dislodged the cupula at the apex of the ampulla (Fig. 1iii 
Ap) to improve visualization and allow for continuous endolymph pumping around the canal. Dislodging the 
cupula eliminates the traditional lower corner frequency (~0.06 Hz in the present animal model), but does not 
change the forces responsible for endolymph pumping by waves in the vicinity of the dehiscence25. Supplemental 
movies show endolymph pumping over the top of the dislodged cupula (Fig. 5 Ap) evoked by auditory frequency 
stimuli (Supplemental Video 4). Vector fields show steady endolymph velocity in response to 800 and 2044 Hz 
acoustic stimuli (Fig. 5A,C). Endolymph velocity during stimulation at frequencies from 2 to 3000 Hz shows mul-
tiple peak frequencies in excitatory and inhibitory directions (Fig. 5B). Since the frequency spectra are expected 
to depend on canal morphology, stiffness and stimulation location, as well as on post-mechanical neural signal 
processing, differences in the spectrum of sensitivity between individual animals and species was expected (e.g. 
Fig. 4E). Results in Figs 4–5 confirm steady endolymph pumping occurs in a model of canal dehiscence and 
underlies sustained afferent responses to sound under these conditions.
Discussion
Present results explain the origin of Tullio phenomena, where a dehiscence or fistula in the bony labyrinth results 
in pathological and debilitating vestibular responses to sound. Introducing a flexible window in the bony laby-
rinth alters pressure gradients in the inner ear, which causes hearing loss and introduces abnormal vestibular 
sensitivity to sound. Conductive hearing loss and vestibular sensitivity to low-frequency stimuli are relatively 
straightforward to explain on the basis of pressure-driven displacement of inner ear fluids6,8,9,19, but sustained 
responses of SCC afferent neurons to auditory frequency stimuli are more difficult to explain. Here, we present 
experimental and theoretical evidence that sustained SCC responses to auditory frequency stimuli are due to 
traveling waves arising at the site of the dehiscenc and propagate in both directions to pump endolymph around 
the afflicted SCC. Two consequences of these waves combine to generate vestibular sensitivity to sound. First, the

waves vibrate the membranous labyrinth, leading to cycle-by-cycle displacement of sensory hair bundles, modu-
lation of mechano-electrical transduction currents, and phase-locked action potentials. Second, traveling waves 
pump endolymph around the SCC loop21, mimicking angular head acceleration, leading to tonic hair bundle 
displacements, and evoking sustained changes in action potential firing rate. Notably, sound-evoked vibration 
and endolymph pumping caused by waves are also present in the intact labyrinth, however are decreased by two 
orders of magnitude or more.
The fact that waves originate at the dehiscence and travel in both directions toward the sound source might 
seem counterintuitive, but the phenomenon arises directly from the mechanics. Compressibility of the inner ear 
fluids is negligible at physiologically relevant pressures, so any net inward movement of fluid driven by sound 
pressure at the oval window must be balanced by an outward movement at the dehiscence and the round win-
dow. If the dehiscence size is small compared to the vestibule, the fluid displacement at the dehiscence will be 
relatively large. Hence, the largest pressure modulation acting across the vestibular membranous labyrinth is 
at the dehiscence, giving rise to traveling waves propagating away from the dehiscence (e.g. Fig. 1Ai). Because 
of this, the condition can be modeled experimentally by mechanical stimulation at the site of the dehiscence. 
Notably, in many cases of canal dehiscence, there is sufficient bone loss to allow dura to herniate into the canal,

which defects the membranous labyrinth and induces pulsatile oscillopsia synchronous with heartbeat31–33. 
Frequency-dependent endolymph pumping occurs due to asymmetric traveling wave reflection. Multiple reflec-
tions lead to a combination of standing waves and traveling waves in the both limbs of the dehisced canal (e.g. 
Fig. 2). As a result, pumping occurs ampullofugal or ampullopetal depending on which limb of the canal admits 
the dominant traveling wave. The direction of wave pumping can switch with frequency (e.g. Figs 4E and 5), 
because the extent of reflection in the two directions is dependent on tissue morphology and stimulus frequency. 
Accounting for bi-directional propagation is essential to capture frequency dependence of the direction and mag-
nitude of pumping – features of Tullio phenomena that cannot be explained by unidirectional wave propagation21.
The fundamental mechanisms responsible for waves in the vestibular labyrinth are identical to those respon-
sible for traveling waves in the cochlea. In both cases, the system consists of two fluid compartments separated by 
a flexible partition. The fluids provide the kinetic energy (mass) and the partition provides the potential energy 
(stiffness), which combine with viscosity to give rise to dispersive traveling waves. In the cochlea, the oval and 
round windows are positioned in such a way to preferentially excite traveling waves on the flexible cochlear par-
tition, while avoiding excitation of traveling waves on the flexible “vestibular partition”
. Introduction of a SCC 
dehiscence or fistula adds a third flexible window that allows vibration of the oval window to excite traveling

waves along the vestibular partition. Since the vestibular system lacks the specialized morphology of the coch-
lea, there is no equivalent “place principle” or traveling wave frequency decomposition. Nevertheless, there is 
sound-evoked wave propagation very similar to the cochlea. Waves originate at the dehiscence, propagate in both 
directions, decay with distance, reflect due to changes in geometry, and combine to generate frequency-dependent 
patterns of standing and traveling waves. Like the cochlea, cycle-by-cycle vibration of hair bundles leads to affer-
ent nerve responses phase-locked to auditory frequency stimuli. In addition, nonlinear wave pumping evokes 
slow responses that build up during the acoustic stimulus and decay upon cessation of the stimulus. The same 
wave pump phenomenon is present in the cochlea, but its effect on cochlear mechanics and potential impact on 
the sensation of sound has not yet been examined. Avoiding responses to low-frequency wave pumping might be 
one reason why auditory hair cells evolved to selectively encode to high-frequency signals through the high-pass 
filter characteristics of their mechano-electrical transduction channels34,35. Many SCC hair cells, in contrast, do 
not have this high-pass characteristic29, thus making the canals sensitive to low-frequency physiological stimuli 
as well as pathological nonlinear wave pumping in dehisced canals.
Experimental evidence reported previously demonstrate that a dehiscence in the superior canal can also 
increase sound-evoked responses in the horizontal canal and otolith organs8,11,36–38. Present results indicate this 
occurs through the same two mechanisms that affect the dehisced canal – vibration delivered by waves, and 
wave pumping of endolymph. Waves emanating in both directions from the dehiscence are not restricted to 
the afflicted canal, but instead are partially transmitted at canal bifurcations to spread throughout the vestib-
ular labyrinth25,39. Multiple waves combine to generate complex patterns of sound-evoked standing and trave-
ling waves that vibrate the sensory hair bundles in the sister canals and otolith organs. This increased vibration 
would be expected to preferentially activate a class of auditory-frequency sensitive otolith afferents with irregular 
background discharge statistics at rest, thus explaining the decreased thresholds for eliciting vestibular myo-
genic potentials in patients with a superior canal dehiscence37,40,41. In addition to vibration, wave pumping in 
the afflicted canal stagnates endolymph against the cupula, thus giving rise to a pressure gradient around the 
canal loop (e.g. Fig. 2). The sound-evoked pressure gradient generated by a superior canal dehiscence, for exam-
ple, would act at canal bifurcations to evoke tonic endolymph displacement in the horizontal canal. These two 
mechanical facts likely underlie horizontal canal activation as well as the horizontal component of sound-evoked 
eye movements in patients with superior canal dehiscence8,11.
Results demonstrate why normal physiological function of the semicircular canals and the otolith organs 
requires the entire vestibular labyrinth to be encased in rigid bone. Any condition that opens an additional mobile 
window (or windows) in the bony labyrinth would be expected to increase sensitivity of vestibular organs to 
sound, pressure and vibration because the opening breaks the pressure balance normally present between endo-
lymph and perilymph. Breaking the balance causes pathological responses through deformation/vibration of the 
membranous labyrinth and nonlinear endolymph pumping. The critical importance of the bony labyrinth likely 
explains its early appearance as well as uniform presence in early hominids and extant vertebrate species42–45. 
Conditions such as an enlarged vestibular aqueduct or surgically introduced windows are clinical examples that 
would also break the balance46.
It is important to note that the Tullio phenomenon is only one of many symptoms associated with canal dehis-
cence. For example, patients with a superior canal dehiscence present with an elevated air-bone gap, and increased 
sensitivity to bone-conducted vibration9,47. Present results support two underlying biomechanical mechanisms. 
First, a dehiscence diverts acoustic power away from the cochlea when sound enters the inner ear via the ossicular 
chain19 and second, a dehiscence increases inner ear fluid vibration in response to bone-conducted vibration. In 
the intact bony labyrinth, linear acceleration or vibration of the temporal bone generates nearly equal pressure 
gradients in the perilymph and endolymph that cancel each other and minimize pressure driven deformation 
of the membranous labyrinth. A dehiscence breaks this balance, and introduces pressure driven vibration of 
inner ear fluids. For vibration stimuli, the transmembrane pressure is proportional to frequency squared and 
particularly large at the location of the dehiscence. Based on the present work, this vibration induced pressure 
imbalance would be predicted to trigger traveling waves and fluid pumping. The traveling wave component would 
be expected to excite the cochlea via cycle-by-cycle pressure modulation at the oval window and increasing sen-
sitivity of the cochlea to bone conducted vibration.
The mechanisms described here also might explain changes in electrocochleography (ECoG) in cases of supe-
rior canal dehiscence, where the short-latency stimulus evoked response (SP) increases relative to the long-latency 
response (AP)48. Sound clicks are known to evoke short latency action potentials in vestibular afferent neurons49, 
and to generate short latency extracellular field potentials. Results support the hypothesis that the ECoG SP 
response arises in part from high-frequency responses of vestibular otolith organs (increases with dehiscence), 
while the AP response arises primarily from the cochlea (decreases with dehiscence). Ménière’s disease and other 
conditions that differentially alter vestibular vs. cochlear responses to sound could also alter the SP/AP ratio.
Our results support the hypothesis that sound-evoked eye movements observed in patients with a superior 
canal dehiscence arise from both sustained sound-evoked activation of phase-locking irregularly-discharging 
SCC afferents combined with slowly developing but sustained excitation/inhibition of regularly discharging SCC 
afferents11. The phase-locked afferents would be expected to drive the nonlinear high-frequency vestibulo-ocular 
reflex (VOR) thus leading to rapid onset slow-phase eye movements16. Rapid excitation would almost always be 
excitatory because vibration-evoked phase-locking is excitatory11,14,30,50. The direction of the rapid eye movement 
would be expected to map primarily to the dehisced SCC with a secondary component arising from the sister 
horizontal canal. Superimposed on this rapid excitation is a slower component arising from regularly-discharging 
afferents with onset following the slow time constant of the semicircular canals (e.g. 10–15 s). Present results 
demonstrate that slow inhibition vs. excitation of these afferents depends on frequency. Sound-evoked neuronal 
responses are unilateral, so eye movements are further complicated by the inherent excitatory-inhibitory asym-
metry of the unilateral VOR. These effects likely combine to explain the relatively fast onset of slow phase eye

movements and the predominantly excitatory direction. Upon cessation of the sound, phase-locked afferent 
responses immediately cease (e.g. Fig. 3) while sustained responses slowly return to baseline following the slow 
mechanical time constant of the canal (e.g. Fig. 4, tails). Eye movements recorded during this tail period are 
therefore a more direct measure of sound-evoked cupula displacement, while eye movements during the onset 
also include a vibration-induced response.
Methods
Experimental methods. 
Oyster toadfish, Opsanus tau, (Woods Hole, MA) were prepared using previously 
published methods51,52. The University of Utah Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved all ani-
mal procedures and all experiments were performed in compliance with relevant policies and regulations. In 
brief, fish were anesthetized (MS222, 3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester; Sigma), immobilized (pancuronium bro-
mide; Sigma), and secured in plastic tank filled with oxygenated seawater. A ~2 cm dorsal craniotomy was made 
to give access to the vestibular labyrinth and the perilymph was replaced with fluorocarbon (3 M, FC-880). Lateral 
canal recordings were made with conventional glass microelectrodes. A polished glass pipette fixed to a piezoe-
lectric actuator was used to apply controlled mechanical stimulation of the lateral canal in a location approximate 
to that of a canal dehiscence (Fig. 1B, SD). Mechanical vibration of the membranous duct at auditory frequencies 
was used to model sound-evoked responses in a dehiscent canal. This model was motivated by results of our 
finite-element simulations demonstrating wave propagation away from the dehiscence site as well as reciprocity 
between stimulation of the dehiscence site vs. the vestibule. Eleven fish contributed useful data.
The regularity of neurons was characterized by the coefficient of variation. Firing rate was defined by the 
inverse of the inter-spike-interval, Spks−
1-s, between adjacent action potentials and the mean firing rate (μ
⁎) and 
standard deviation (σ
⁎) of each neuron during spontaneous activity were computed. Coefficient of variation was 
calculated as the standard deviation over the mean. Phase-locking of neurons was quantified by the winding ratio 
and vector strength. The winding ratio is defined as the ratio of action potentials fired for each stimulus cycle (j:k). 
The most sensitive afferent neurons will fire with a winding ratio of 1:1 where an action potential occurs for each 
stimulus cycle. For example, the neuron in Fig. 3A is responding at winding ratios k = 3 and k = 4. Vector strength 
was calculated as =

2 , where ai is the phase angle, and n is the spikes in the inter-
val. Vector strength approaches 0 as the timing of action potential is random relative to the stimulus, and 
approaches 1 as the timing of the action potential is the same phase for each stimulus cycle.
For particle imaging velocimetry, one micron fluorescent microspheres (Bangs Laboratories, FSDG004) were 
soaked overnight in lectin (lectin from Triticum vulgaris (Sigma, L9640) and PBS (1 M, Sigma). The microsphere 
solution was mixed with fluorescent dextran (fluorescein isothiocyanate–dextran; Sigma, FD40S). A small (~20 
um) hole was made in the lateral canal ampulla with an electrosurgical generator (Valleylab) set to a 15 W pure 
cutting waveform with a sharpened tungsten wire as the cutting electrode. The microsphere solution was inserted 
into the hole with a glass pipette and the hole was then sealed (Locktite, 1710908). Images were collected with an 
upright microscope (Axioskop Tech, Carl Zeiss, Germany) and a CCD camera (Retiga-EXi, QImaging, Surrey, 
BC, Canada) at a frame rate of ~150 ms and exposure time of ~100 ms. Images were analyzed in MATLAB 2016a 
with a time-resolved particle imaging velocimetry tool to calculate endolymph velocity direction and magni-
tude53. Magnitude velocity changes were scaled by the amplitude of the stimulus.
Modeling methods. 
We analyzed nonlinear mechanics of the endolymph, perilymph, deformable membra-
nous labyrinth, cupula, and the bony enclosure in the morphology of a single semicircular canal using two com-
plementary approaches: 1) full 3-D finite-element (FE) solution of the nonlinear Navier-Stokes equations coupled 
to a deformable membranous labyrinth (Comsol, Burlington, MA), and 2) a 1-D wave model of a fluid-filled flex-
ible tube inside a fluid-filled rigid tube25. In the finite-element model, we modeled the endolymph and perilymph 
using the 3-D Navier-Stokes equation including viscosity (μ
 = 8.5 ×
 10−
6 kg-s−
1), density (ρ
 = 1000 kg-m3) and 
the convective nonlinearity. Bulk viscosity was neglected. The membranous labyrinth was modeled as a flexible 
elastic shell with elastic modulus (E = 3 kPa), Poisson ratio (v = 0.04) and thickness (h = 2 ×
 10−
5 m). The bony 
labyrinth was modeled as rigid with the exception of the fistula, which was modeled using a pressure relief. The 
model was driven by pressure in the perilymph around the vestibule. The simplified FE morphology shown in 
Fig. 1 was used. Morphology of the human canal was taken from Curthoys et al.54. The 1-D model is similar to 
classical analysis of wave mechanics in deformable blood vessels and fluid filled tubes55–57, and is particularly 
useful because it lends insight into the fundamental mechanism responsible for wave pumping. In the 1-D model, 
conservation of momentum and conservation of mass applied to the endolymph, perilymph, and the membra-
nous labyrinth results in four coupled partial differential equations for the pressure in the endolymph pe, pressure 
in the perilymph pp, volume displacement of the endolymph relative to the duct qe, and volume displacement of 
the perilymph relative to the bone qp, all as functions of time t and position s along the curved centerline of the 
toroidal canal. In the present work we were interested in determining how sound at acoustic frequencies leads to 
steady pumping of endolymph around the toroidal loop. Expanding the 1-D nonlinear conservation of momen-
tum equation for the endolymph (Eq. 4 from Iversen et al.25) for small changes in cross sectional area provides

where Ae0 is the undeformed cross-sectional area of the membranous duct and g(s, t) arises from mechanical 
indentation of the membranous duct (which is zero if no indentation is applied). By conservation of mass, ∂

measures the change in cross sectional area (Eq. 1, Iversen et al.). This nonlinear term introduces parametrically 
driven “wave pumping” of endolymph generated by auditory frequency stimuli.
To quantify wave pumping we note that there are two characteristic time scales in the problem: a “fast time” 
associated with the auditory frequency stimulus, and a “slow time” associated with pumping of endolymph (the 
equations can be written in nondimensional form and solved using the multi-scale perturbation method58 but for 
simplicity we present an approximate solution here obtained by averaging over the fast time scale). We approxi-
mate the endolymph displacement as a sum of two terms, a vibrational term at the fast auditory frequency, and a 
slower pumping term associated with the characteristic slow time constant:

qe0 is the solution of the linear problem when ε
→0, derived previously in the frequency domain25. This is the term 
that vibrates sensory hair bundles at the auditory frequency and is responsible for phase-locked action potentials.

This term is identically zero if the membranous duct is rigid, and hence wave pumping does not occur in rigid 
fluid-filled tubes. Substituting qe0 into Eq. 6 provides f, which is a constant for a given stimulus frequency because 
of the integrations over both time and space. f is nonzero if the membranous duct deforms, but it can have either 
sign based on frequency and the specific spatio-temporal distribution of membranous duct deformation.
Eq. 5 explains how auditory frequency stimuli generate pumping. Consider the case when an auditory fre-
quency stimulus is suddenly turned on at time t = tON, and turned off at time =
t
tOFF. The solution of Eq. 5 in this 
case is
