Study objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical and operational effectiveness of US federal government
guidance (Primary Response Incident Scene Management [PRISM]) for the initial response phase to chemical incidents.
Methods: The study was performed as a large-scale exercise (Operation DOWNPOUR). Volunteers were dosed with a chemical
warfare agent simulant to quantify the efficacy of different iterations of dry, ladder pipe system, or technical decontamination.
Results: The most effective process was a triple combination of dry, ladder pipe system, and technical decontamination, which
attained an average decontamination efficiency of approximately 100% on exposed hair and skin sites. Both wet decontamination
processes (ladder pipe system and technical decontamination, alone or in combination with dry decontamination) were also
effective (decontamination efficiency >96%). In compliant individuals, dry decontamination was effective (decontamination
efficiency approximately 99%), but noncompliance (tentatively attributed to suboptimal communication) resulted in significantly
reduced efficacy (decontamination efficiency approximately 70%). At-risk volunteers (because of chronic illness, disability, or
language barrier) were 3 to 8 times slower than ambulatory casualties in undergoing dry and ladder pipe system
decontamination, a consequence of which may be a reduction in the overall rate at which casualties can be processed.
Conclusion: The PRISM incident response protocols are fit for purpose for ambulatory casualties. However, a more effective
communication strategy is required for first responders (particularly when guiding dry decontamination). There is a clear need to
develop more appropriate decontamination procedures for at-risk casualties. [Ann Emerg Med. 2019;73:671-684.]

INTRODUCTION
Background
Contaminated casualties present unique challenges to
the first-responder community. In particular, toxic
chemicals may rapidly elicit adverse health effects, and thus
quick and effective mitigation strategies are required.1 A
variety of documentation has been developed to cover the
response to hazardous material or chemical, biological,
radiologic, nuclear, and explosive incidents,2-11 with more
recent US federal guidance (Primary Response Incident
Scene Management [PRISM]) incorporating evidence-
based protocols.12 The PRISM model is focused on the
initial “disrobe and decontaminate” response to chemical
incidents. Thus, emphasis is placed on the rapidity of the
initial response to prioritize casualty survival.
Importance
The established emergency response to major chemical
incidents in the United States is the implementation of
“gross decontamination” of casualties. Essentially, this
entails showering individuals with a high-volume, low-
pressure mist of water delivered into a corridor formed by 2
fire engines parked in parallel, with an aerial spray delivered
from a hose strapped to an overhead ladder—hence, the
alternative term “ladder pipe system.”13 Previously, this
emergency form of decontamination was performed on fully
clothed casualties14; this practice is now known to transfer
contamination from clothing to the underlying skin.12
Deployment of the ladder pipe system decontamination is
relatively rapid and so provides an opportunity for early
intervention while advanced facilities are being established,

TRAUMA/ORIGINAL RESEARCH
 Editor’s Capsule Summary
What is already known on this topic
Contaminated victims of hazardous materials or
terrorist attacks need to be decontaminated.
What question this study addressed
Several methods of decontamination have been
proposed and deployed. Their effectiveness and
efficiency had not been rigorously tested previously.
What this study adds to our knowledge
In healthy ambulatory victims, dry decontamination
and ladder pipe decontamination are comparable to
full technical decontamination. In nonambulatory
victims and those with barriers to following
instructions, dry and ladder pipe decontamination
take much longer, so more resources must be
committed to achieve rapid decontamination.
How this is relevant to clinical practice
People tasked with emergency planning and response
for communities, hospitals, and emergency
departments can now choose among
decontamination methods that work well.
such as technical decontamination: specialist units that
provide warm water, a degree of privacy, and containment
of effluent.15 Current planning entails supplementing
this conventional approach with the introduction of a
“disrobe and dry decontamination” stage as part of a revised
initial operational response strategy (Figure 1).
The primary rationale for performing disrobe and dry
decontamination is time; a delay of 10 to 20 minutes to
establish ladder pipe system decontamination is not
unrealistic, and during this time, the window of opportunity
to effectively remove toxic chemicals from hair and skin may
be missed.12 The introduction of a dry decontamination
stage therefore makes full and effective use of this inherent
delay and should not affect the concept of operations for
delivery of the conventional incident response. Any form of
absorbent material will suffice for dry decontamination16; for
example, tissue paper, toilet paper, paper towels, diapers,
or absorbent materials carried routinely on ambulances
(eg, wound dressings, incontinence pads). Therefore, dry
decontamination can be rapidly implemented because it
does not rely on specialist resources.
Goals of This Investigation
The aim of this present study was to evaluate the clinical
and operational benefits of the revised (PRISM) response
process during a multiagency, large-scale exercise (Operation
DOWNPOUR), performed in Rhode Island. The study was
designed to investigate the effects of single or combined
decontamination strategies, with particular reference to the
hair and underlying scalp. A proportion of volunteers
represented “at-risk casualties,” the PRISM definition of
which is “individuals who are unable, for any reason, to
comply with verbal instructions.” The use of at-risk
volunteers was deemed essential to account for and address
meaningful access to decontamination planning and
procedures for the approximately 20% of the current US
population who have a disability,17 thus satisfying the
legal requirements for equal access before, during, and after a
disaster in compliance with extant legislation (Americans
with Disabilities Act, Pub. L. No. 101-336, tit. II, § 202,
104 Stat. 337 [1990]; Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Pub. L.
No. 93-112, § 504, 87 Stat. 394 [29 U.S.C. § 794]).
At-risk volunteers were recruited for the exercise and
comprised individuals with a disability or individuals whose
main language was not English. The primary measure of
clinical effectiveness was quantification of a chemical warfare
agent simulant recovered from the hair and skin of volunteers
at the end of the exercise. This was supplemented with
Figure 1. Traditional and revised (PRISM) chemical incident response models. After a contamination event, there was a delay
between exposure and functional deployment of LPS decontamination during the initial operational response phase. The revised
version reduces the delay by the introduction of a disrobe and DD step. DD, Dry decontamination; LPS, ladder pipe system of

 whole-body fluorescent imaging to visualize the distribution
of simulant on the volunteers. Global Positioning System
(GPS) trackers were used to provide information on casualty
flow and so provided an objective measure of operational
effectiveness. Postexercise questionnaires were used to collate
information from the perspective of the volunteers and
incident response personnel.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
First-responder teams (“players”) were kindly provided
by North Kingstown Fire Department, South Kingstown
Fire Department, Kingston Fire Department, North
Providence Fire Department, Hopkins Hill Fire
Department, the University of Rhode Island Emergency
Medical Services, Rhode Island Department of Health, and
the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Clinical
support (volunteer examination and emergency medical
cover) was provided by the Rhode Island Disaster Medical
Assistance Team.
The exercise was performed on August 3, 2017, at the
University of Rhode Island’s Ryan Center. The prevailing
weather conditions were 24�C to 27�C (75�F to 80�F),
85% relative humidity, with a southerly wind of 16 to 32
km/hour (7.5 to 20 miles/hour). The response teams and
corresponding equipment were predeployed to the parking
lot immediately to the north of the Ryan Center (Figure E1,
available online at http://www.annemergmed.com). When
appropriate, fire department personnel wore full protective
gear with breathing apparatus, in accordance with local
incident response protocols for chemical incidents.
Methyl salicylate (99% purity) and curcumin (98%)
were sourced from Acros Organics (Geel, Belgium).
Propan-2-ol, acetonitrile, methanol, and acetic acid (all
high-performance liquid chromatography grade) were
sourced from FisherScientific (Loughborough, UK), UK.
Deionized water was produced in house by filtration of
tap water through an Integral-3 water purifier (Millipore,
Watford, UK). Multitrauma sterile wound dressings
(30.5�76.2 cm) were purchased from Grainger Inc
(Warwick, RI), disposable cotton towels (80�140 cm;
“Scrummi”) from Fabricsmart Ltd (Kent, UK), cotton
washcloths (30�30 cm; AmazonBasics) from Amazon UK
Services Ltd (London, UK), and Johnson & Johnson’s
Baby Shampoo and baby oil in the UK. GPS trackers
(TK102 Nano GPS) were purchased from Rewire
Security (Bristol, UK) and were used in conjunction with
proprietary analytical software (GPSLive; REM Trading
Ltd, Bristol, UK). Syringe filters (PTFE 0.2 mm) were
purchased from ThermoScientific; syringes (1 mL) and
glass autosampler vials (2 mL), from FisherScientific.
Selection of Participants
The study was conducted in accordance with the
principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and was
independently approved by the University of
Hertfordshire’s Research Ethics Committee and the Rhode
Island Department of Health Institutional Review Board.
Initial recruitment of 103 volunteers was coordinated by
The Olsen Group Ltd (VA), using an online registration
system. After a medical screen by Rhode Island Disaster
Medical Assistance Team health professionals, 16
volunteers were excluded from participation. A total of 87
volunteers (aged 19 to 74 years; 51 men and 36 women)
were subsequently enrolled, of whom one voluntarily
withdrew during the exercise. Twenty-one of the volunteers
(8 men and 13 women) self-declared as being at risk
according to the PRISM definition.12 Of these individuals,
6 had a visual disability, 4 had a chronic illness, 3 had a
cognitive or developmental disability, 5 had a physical
disability requiring mobility assistance, and 3 had a first
language that was not English; the latter were asked to
communicate only in their first language and to act as if
they were unable to understand English. After a briefing,
the volunteers were invited to give written, informed
consent to participate.
Participants were allocated to 1 of 9 treatment groups:
dry decontamination, ladder pipe system decontamination,
technical decontamination, dry decontaminationþladder
pipe system decontamination (dry followed by ladder pipe
system decontamination, also performed on at-risk
individuals), dry decontaminationþtechnical
decontamination (dry followed by technical
decontamination), dry decontaminationþladder pipe
system decontaminationþtechnical decontamination (dry,
then ladder pipe, and then technical decontamination), and
2 control groups ambulant control and at-risk controls)
(Table 1). Allocation of treatments was pseudorandom: on
registration (at 1 of 10 desks operating in parallel) on the
day of the exercise, each ambulant volunteer received a
packet taken from the top of a single stack that had
been arranged in recurring treatment group order (ie, serial
repetition of control, dry decontamination, ladder
pipe system decontamination, technical decontamination,
dry decontaminationþladder pipe system
decontamination, dry decontaminationþtechnical
decontamination, and dry decontaminationþladder pipe
system decontaminationþtechnical decontamination). The
same process was performed for at-risk volunteers.
Therefore, the process was pseudorandom in that the
resulting treatment allocations could not have been
predicted and ensured that the number of volunteers in
each group was the same (before the medical assessment).
Chilcott et al

Volume 73, no. 6 : June 2019
Annals of Emergency Medicine 673
 The packets provided to each volunteer contained relevant
items (T-shirt and shorts to be worn over the participant’s
own swimwear, sandals, a color-coded (treatment-specific)
wristband, volunteer identification number plate, GPS
tracker, clinical record forms, and participant information).
After changing into their exercise attire, attending a safety
briefing, and eating a light lunch, the participants were
organized into treatment groups and transferred to the
relevant exit within the building’s north lobby (Figures E1
and E2) to await dosing with simulant.
The simulant was prepared on the day of the exercise by
dissolving curcumin in methyl salicylate to produce a 10-
mg/mL solution that was then mixed in a 9:1 ratio (weight/
weight) with baby oil. The composition of the simulant was
chosen because methyl salicylate has been extensively used
as a surrogate for lipophilic, medium-volatility, chemical
warfare agents (eg, sulfur mustard, soman) and the
fluorophore (curcumin) provided a noninvasive means of
visually identifying or quantifying the area of exposure. The
lipophilicity of the simulant provided a more robust test of
the decontamination protocols. The resulting solution was
transferred to high-density polyethylene spray bottles (50-
mL capacity; Ampulla Ltd., UK) with a 20-mm-diameter
atomizing orifice. Each spray actuation delivered 240 mg
�12 mg (SD) of simulant. Each spray bottle was fitted with
a spacer (manufactured in house from polylactic acid on an
Ultimaker2 Extendedþ 3D printer; Ultimaker BV,
Netherlands) to ensure a consistent distance between the
spray nozzle and the hair or skin sites on each volunteer.
When placed against skin, each spray actuation resulted in
a reproducible, circular (8-cm-diameter) area of
contamination. Each volunteer was dosed at 3 sites: back of
the head (480 mg), upper chest (240 mg), and palm of the
right hand (240 mg). The back of the head was
contaminated to allow an evaluation of hair
decontamination. The palm of the right hand was dosed to
identify any potential transfer of contaminant to other
areas. The upper chest was selected because it was clothed
and so would provide confirmation of the effectiveness of
disrobing. The higher dose on the head was required to
ensure detectable quantities on the underlying skin because
we have previously demonstrated that hair provides a high
degree of protection against skin contamination.18
At the start of the exercise, volunteers from each
treatment group were dosed simultaneously as they exited
the building into area A or B (Figure E1, available online at
http://www.annemergmed.com), where they subsequently
mixed with individuals from other treatment groups. The
dosing process was completed within 1 minute and
provided a realistic, en masse presentation of casualties.
Volunteers were subsequently guided to relevant treatment
areas by marshals positioned at strategic points throughout
the exercise area (Figure E2, available online at http://www.
annemergmed.com). To limit interference with the
exercise, marshals were instructed not to transfer
participants unless given a clear signal by the exercise
players. Egress of a volunteer from area A (under the
control of emergency medical services [EMS] personnel)
was used as a signal for marshals in area B to send one
volunteer (not undergoing dry decontamination) from each
treatment group to the next appropriate position in the
exercise. The purpose of this was to synchronize the
participation of volunteers not undergoing initial disrobe
and dry decontamination so that (1) all control (untreated)
volunteers were dispatched to the rendezvous point along
timescales similar to those for individuals undergoing
decontamination treatments, and (2) there was an objective
prompt for marshals to introduce volunteers into the
exercise for treatment groups not requiring dry
decontamination (and thus not initially under the direct
control of the exercise players). The routes taken through

 the exercise by individuals in each treatment group are
illustrated in Figure E2, available online at http://www.
annemergmed.com.
Dry decontamination was performed in accordance with
PRISM guidelines.12 Volunteers in area A were instructed
by EMS personnel to disrobe (down to their swimwear).
Decontamination material (packets of wound dressing)
were thrown into the area by EMS staff (Figure E3,
available online at http://www.annemergmed.com), who
constantly provided verbal instruction in alignment with
the PRISM guidance. When deemed appropriate, EMS
personnel instructed volunteers to proceed to the next
phase of the exercise.
Ladder pipe system decontamination was deployed
according to a standard, local protocol. Briefly, 2 fire
engines (Renegade 2,000 gallon/minute pump trucks;
Pierce Manufacturing, Appleton, WI) were parked in
parallel to produce a central corridor approximately 3.7 m
(12 ft) wide, into which a high-volume, low-pressure water
mist was introduced through side nozzles (1.75-in Task
Force Tip). A ladder truck (E-One HP100 series;
Emergency One Inc, Ocala, FL) was used to position a
spray nozzle (Elkhart Brass Manufacturing Company Inc,
IN) directly above the corridor to provide an overhead
source of water (Figure E4, available online at http://www.
annemergmed.com). The time taken to predeploy the
ladder pipe system decontamination was approximately
12 minutes. On arrival at area C, volunteers were instructed
to disrobe (if still wearing outer garments) and subsequently
enter the ladder pipe system decontamination corridor
under the command and supervision of fire department
officers. The ladder pipe system decontamination protocol
involved a 15-second immersion in the middle of the
decontamination corridor. During this time, volunteers were
instructed to rub themselves with their hands from head to
toe. On exiting the corridor, the volunteers were given a
towel and instructed to dry themselves for 30 seconds before
being transferred to the next appropriate area.
Technical decontamination was performed with specialist
decontamination units (FSI North America, Sheffield, OH)
(Figure E5, available online at http://www.annemergmed.
com) in accordance with the Optimisation through Research
of Chemical Incident Decontamination Systems showering
protocol.15,19,20 Each unit contained 6 overhead hoses with
manually activated spray nozzles, which supplied warm
(35�C [95�F]) water at a maximum rate of 56 L/minute from
a water heater (Model 200A; FSI International) connected to
a fire hydrant. Volunteers arriving at area D were instructed
by fire department officers to disrobe (if not already done) and
enter the decontamination unit, where they were asked to
shower while wiping themselves down with a washcloth
(pretreated with 10 mL baby shampoo). After washing for
approximately 90 seconds, the volunteers were asked to
discard the washcloth and exit the unit, where they were given
a clean towel to dry themselves before being directed to area E.
The exercise finished when the last volunteer reached
area E (rendezvous point). Any volunteers who remained
clothed (ie, control treatment groups) were instructed to
disrobe. All volunteers were immediately transferred back
to the Ryan Center for whole-body fluorescence imaging
and skin and hair swabs to visualize and quantify the
recovery of any residual simulant.
Swab samples were taken from 8 sites on each volunteer:
right palm, upper chest, hair at the back of the head,
underlying scalp skin, abdomen, left palm, left cheek, and
lower back. Prepared sets of glass vials containing 3 cotton
swabs or jars containing 3 cotton pads were weighed before
use. A (single-use) plastic template (with a 3-cm-diameter
circular aperture) was applied to each skin site, from which
serial, triplicate swabs of the site were taken with cotton swabs.
The first and last swabs were performed with dry cotton
swabs, whereas the second swab was immersed in solvent
(propan-2-ol) before use. To facilitate access for scalp skin
samples, a comb was used to part the hair at the swabbing site
before application of the plastic template. The cotton swabs
were returned to their original glass vial. The procedure for
acquiring hair swabs was similar, except that an 8-cm-
diameter plastic template was used in conjunction with 3
cotton pads. All hair and skin swab samples were subsequently
immersed in propan-2-ol (10 mL per cotton swab vial and
200 mL per cotton pad jar), reweighed, and stored in
lightproof boxes at ambient temperature before analysis.
Before leaving the exercise, volunteers received a brief
medical assessment and completed a postexercise
questionnaire to elicit opinions on how clean the
individuals felt after their treatment and how they
perceived their interactions with the emergency service
personnel. The response to each question was graded
numerically (1 to 5). First responders attended a “hot
debrief” immediately after the exercise to provide verbal
feedback.
Data Collection and Processing
Whole-body fluorescent imaging was performed within
a lightproof unit. Volunteers entered the unit in pairs and
were illuminated by an array of 12 light-emitting diode
tubes (Arcadia T8, LED Marine Blue; Arcadia Ltd., Surrey,
UK), between which 2 digital single-lens reflex cameras
(EOS 80D; Canon UK Ltd, Surrey, UK) were positioned.
Video footage (30 ft/second) of the front and back of each
pair of volunteers was acquired in less than 10 seconds.
Spatial calibration (pixels/millimeter) was performed with a
Chilcott et al
Mass Decontamination of Casualties During a Chemical Incident

Annals of Emergency Medicine 675
 test card positioned at the same distance from the camera as
each volunteer. Individual frames of the front and back of
each volunteer were extracted from the video footage with
Final Cut Pro software (version 10.3.1; Apple Inc,
Cupertino, CA). The analysis work flow consisted of the
delineation and removal of extraneous areas of fluorescence
(eg, from swimwear) from each image, using a graphics
tablet (Wacom Intuos Pro, Düsseldorf, Germany) in
combination with Adobe Photoshop CC (version 2017.1.1;
Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA). Open-source software
(Fiji, version 1.021)21 was subsequently used to convert each
image to 8-bit format and to extract red-channel data. A
blanket segmentation threshold limit of 75 was selected and
applied for subsequent particle analysis and calculation of
the area of residual contamination (skin fluorescence).
Quantification of the recovery of methyl salicylate in the
swab samples was performed with a ThermoScientific
UltiMate U3000 high-performance liquid chromatography
system (quaternary pump, autosampler, and column oven)
and a ThermoScientific Vanquish Diode Array Detector.
Separation was achieved with a ThermoScientific HyPurity
C18 column (150�2.1 mm, 5-mm internal diameter).
Instrumentation was controlled by proprietary software
(Chromeleon, version 7.2; ThermoScientific). All swab
samples were briefly vortex mixed before being syringe
filtered into vials (2 mL) for direct autosampler injection
(2 mL). The mobile phase comprised 60% aqueous
acetic acid (pH 3) and 40% acetonitrile at a flow rate of
0.4 mL/minute. The column temperature was 30�C (86�F)
and ultraviolet detection was set at a maximum wavelength
of 303 nm. A nonmatrix calibration standard series (0.0289
to 1,184 mg/mL) was analyzed with each batch, with
quality control samples (0.0474, 3.55, and 829 mg/mL)
bracketing up to 20 samples to confirm the acceptable
accuracy (85% to 115%) and precision (�15 [SD]) of the
chromatographic system. Samples were quantified against a
matrix calibration series (0.025 to 1,100 mg/mL) diluted
from a matrix (cotton pad or cotton swab) spiked with the
dosing simulant on the day of the study and extracted in
propan-2-ol as per the exercise samples. Unspiked (blank)
solutions were prepared simultaneously for each sample
matrix.
The time spent by each volunteer in areas A to E was
estimated from the GPS tracking data. Briefly, rectangular
coordinates corresponding to areas A to E were identified
with mapping software (Apple Maps version 2.0; Apple
Inc). The data from each GPS tracker were downloaded
onto a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet (version 15.33;
Microsoft, Redmond, WA) and the cumulative time spent
in each area was calculated. Individuals’ GPS data were
checked visually by plotting the tracker coordinates on a
graph with an overlay of each area (Figure E6, available
online at http://www.annemergmed.com).
Primary Data Analysis
Each data set was evaluated with the D’Agostino-Pearson
omnibus normality test for Gaussian distributions. The data
were found not to be normally distributed, so nonparametric
tests were performed. The 2 control groups were not
significantly different from each other (P>.99) and so these
data were pooled to improve statistical power. Differences
between treatment groups were evaluated with an unpaired
(Kruskal-Wallis) ANOVA, with multiple comparisons
posttest (with Bonferroni correction). Statistical analysis was
performed with GraphPad Prism (version 7.a; GraphPad
Software, La Jolla, CA). The relative effectiveness of each
decontamination protocol was expressed as the reduction in
contamination as a percentage of control,
%E ¼ 100 �
�QD
QC
� 100
�
Equation 1
where decontamination efficiency is the percentage
effectiveness of decontamination and Q is the average
quantity of simulant recovered from the skin surface of
decontaminated (D) or control (C) volunteers.
Empirical modeling of the GPS tracker data was
performed by plotting the time of entry into dry
decontamination (area A), ladder pipe system
decontamination (area C), and technical decontamination
(area D) as a function of the duration in each area, followed
by nonlinear regression using a least squares (ordinary) fit
with asymmetrical 95% confidence levels. The resulting
equations were used to predict the times and duration of
ladder pipe system decontamination and technical
decontamination. These predictions were compared against
those acquired during the exercise by expressing the
outputs in terms of number of casualties per
decontamination area with time.
RESULTS
In control individuals, the largest recoveries of methyl
salicylate (expressed as mean; 95% confidence interval
[CI]) (Figure 2) were from the hair (1,317 mg; 95% CI 296
to 2,337 mg), scalp skin (69 mg; 95% CI 5 to 133 mg),
chest (35 mg; 95% CI –34 to 104 mg), and lower back (29
mg; 95% CI –29 to 88 mg), with relatively small recoveries
from the abdomen (0.6 mg; 95% CI –0.5 to 1.8), right
palm (0.7 mg; 95% CI 0.2 to 1.2 mg), left cheek (0.3 mg;
95% CI –0.2 to 0.7 mg), and left palm (0.05; 95% CI
–0.02 to 0.12 mg). The ratio of methyl salicylate
contamination between the hair and underlying scalp skin

Volume 73, no. 6 : June 2019
 was approximately 20, indicating that the majority of the
dose applied to the head remained in the hair. The
relatively low recoveries of methyl salicylate from the
majority of sites that were not directly contaminated (left
palm, left cheek, and abdomen) implied minimal cross
contamination from exposed skin sites.

 Statistically, the triple-combination process (dry
decontaminationþladder pipe system
decontaminationþtechnical decontamination) provided
the most consistently effective performance, achieving a
significant reduction in methyl salicylate recovery at all 4
sites of initial contamination (Table 2). The 3 double
combinations (dry decontaminationþladder pipe system
decontamination, dry decontaminationþladder pipe
system decontamination [at risk] and dry
decontaminationþtechnical decontamination) and the
ladder pipe system decontamination–only treatments were
significantly effective at 3 of the 4 exposure sites (Table 2).
Of the single-decontamination processes, technical
decontamination was significantly effective at 2 of the 4
initial dosing sites (hair and chest), whereas dry
decontamination was significantly effective at one (chest)
(Table 2). The significant difference between all
decontamination treatments and controls at the chest area
implies a synergistic effect with disrobing (which was
performed by the control volunteers at the end of the
exercise).
The frequent lack of statistical significance in
decontamination efficacy was a consequence of the inherent
variability in methyl salicylate recovery measurements: the
coefficient of variance ranged from 138% (dry
decontaminationþladder pipe system
decontaminationþtechnical decontamination) to 293%
(dry decontaminationþtechnical decontamination), with
the (pooled) control coefficient of variance being 180%.
The statistical analysis detracts from the fact that the
decontamination effectiveness was consistently high
(average decontamination efficiency¼97.3%) in all
treatment groups apart from dry decontamination
(Table 2).
The effectiveness of dry decontamination was apparently
lower than that of all other treatments, particularly on the
hair (88.2%), scalp (78.5%), right palm (14.8%), and right
hand (–2,253%) (Table 2). To investigate this further, we
performed a statistical analysis to identify any outliers
(GraphPad Prism ROUT test, with an aggressive
coefficient [Q] of 0.1%). Two outlier data points were
identified at each anatomic location except the lower back
and left cheek. These 2 data points were consistently from
the same 2 volunteers, who were subsequently identified in
video recordings of the dry decontamination area. Both
individuals were observed to remove the wound pad (dry
decontaminant) from the sachet and hold it in their hands.
There was no video evidence to suggest that they
subsequently engaged in the decontamination process. The
reasons for this inactivity cannot be inferred from the video,
although an obstructed view of the EMS personnel may
conceivably have been a contributing factor. Removal of these
outliers from the dry decontamination data set had a profound
effect: after dry decontamination, recoveries of methyl
salicylate from hair (P¼.04), right palm (P¼.02), and chest
(P¼.04) were significantly lower than those for controls,
with an overall effectiveness (decontamination efficiency,
averaged across all initially contaminated sites) of 99%.
There were no significant differences (P>.05) between
control and decontamination treatment groups in the skin
surface spreading of the simulant, indicating that the
various decontamination methods did not cause visually
detectable transfer of contaminant from the point of
application to other body areas.

Mass Decontamination of Casualties During a Chemical Incident
Chilcott et al
678 Annals of Emergency Medicine
Volume 73, no. 6 : June 2019
 The average durations of ambulatory volunteers within
areas A (dry decontamination), C (ladder pipe system
decontamination), and D (technical decontamination) were
3.6�0.7 minutes (SD), 1.6�0.8 minutes (SD), and
3.5�0.5 minutes (SD), respectively. The times spent by
at-risk volunteers in the dry decontamination (11.8�2.6
minutes [SD]) and ladder pipe system decontamination
(16.8�3.6 minutes [SD]) areas were significantly longer
than those for the corresponding ambulatory treatment
group (Figure 3). The total exercise duration (calculated
from the time each volunteer entered the initial holding
area to leaving the rendezvous point) was 39.1 minutes.
Analysis of the GPS data indicated a trend for the
duration spent in the ladder pipe system decontamination
area to increase with time (Figure 4), with a modest
increase or decrease in duration for dry decontamination
and technical decontamination, respectively. Application of
the resulting curve-fit equations to a simple linear model
(Figure E7, available online at http://www.annemergmed.
com) yielded a predicted maximum throughput of 1.2
casualties per minute (Figure 5).
Participants reported that they received clear instructions
from the first responders during treatment(s) involving
ladder pipe system decontamination or technical
decontamination (Figure E8, available online at http://
www.annemergmed.com). However, the response was
borderline when the treatment(s) included dry
decontamination: several volunteers stated that they could
not adequately hear instructions because of a combined
effect of distance and background noise. This was noted by
one of the volunteers who stated that “There were 4 rows of
40 people out the front.. I couldn’t really hear.so you
needed a couple of people there with a megaphone or
something to broadcast that information or repeat telling
everybody what to do.”
There was agreement that, in a real emergency, the
volunteers would be prepared to remain at the scene of an
incident to undergo decontamination treatments, although
this was less emphatic for participants who had undergone
dry decontamination (Figure E8, available online at http://
www.annemergmed.com). Volunteers who underwent dry
decontamination were also more inclined to report a poor
perceived outcome, whereas participants in the ladder pipe
system decontamination or technical decontamination
groups reported that they felt clean (Figure E8, available
online at http://www.annemergmed.com).
There was consensus across all treatment groups that
further medical assessment would be required after
decontamination (Figure E8, available online at http://
www.annemergmed.com).
The dry decontamination process was deemed to be
successful, although some difficulty communicating with
the volunteers was noted by an EMS responder: “It would
be interesting to see in a real situation how far our voices
can carry and how well the victims may be able to listen.”
When asked whether the volunteers appeared to hear the
instructions, an EMS responder stated, “Yes, most of
them. When you say, ‘Go take off your clothes,’ within
35 to 40 seconds the clothes will be off. It’s kind of hard
to coordinate, as not everybody takes their clothes off at
the same rate, so I found myself repeating myself a lot.
Some [volunteers] were just standing there waiting for
instructions they may have missed. Many were further
back, which made it more difficult to yell instructions.” It
was noted that the wound dressing packs had been
difficult to distribute and that firefighters wearing full
personal protective equipment had needed to intervene by
picking up dressing packs from the floor to hand to the
volunteers.
A ladder pipe operator stated that “It was pretty tough
keeping those people in really cold water, but usually we
were able to communicate with the guys standing on the
end of it demonstrating to make sure you catch as much of
your body as you can. Having a facecloth would have been
really useful.” Although it was agreed that at-risk casualties
clearly benefited from assistance, this raised concerns about

 staffing levels: “Tasking a few of the firefighters to
specifically walk people through that needed additional
assistance.starts messing up the whole process.” It was
thought that 2 additional fire department personnel were
required (to supplement the standard team of 5) to ensure that
the process flowed smoothly and that there would be resource
implications: “If we are going to need 7 people, we need
7 replacements, 7 bottles, 7 packs.. We need to look at
how many pieces of equipment we need, personnel or
resources.” It was also noted that process development was
required to account for different environmental conditions:
“It was a beautiful day, so the people [casualties], they’re going
into this cold water for 15 seconds, which to them seemed an
eternity; there was some screaming going on. But if we
changed this scenario to the middle of winter, then how do we
do the gross decon [ladder pipe system decontamination]
when they’ve had to disrobe.before they to go to technical
decon? That’s another element that will have to be staged.”
Technical decontamination went “smooth and pretty
quick,” and it was confirmed that volunteers received
instructions and guidance for the Optimisation through
Research of Chemical Incident Decontamination Systems
protocol (1.5 minutes, washcloth, and detergent).
LIMITATIONS
Some of the practical limitations of this exercise that
were reported by the players and volunteers have been
detailed above. Such exercises necessarily represent an
artificial operating environment. Therefore, although
measures were taken to minimize artifacts, the outcomes of
this exercise should be interpreted with caution. A clear
limitation of the study design was the inability to blind the
volunteers to the simulant application sites; a more
elaborate, volunteer-blinded method of dosing was not
practically possible, given the need to introduce the large
number of participants quickly into the exercise. A review
of video recordings indicated that the volunteers did not
focus attention on the dosing sites, and so this is unlikely to
have influenced the outcomes of the study. The
pseudorandom allocation of volunteers to respective
treatment groups was also not ideal but a practical necessity
to ensure efficient registration with an even number of
volunteers in each treatment group (before the medical

 evaluations). Finally, the use of local first-responder
agencies undoubtedly introduced a selection bias. Because
the clinical outcomes of the exercise were predominantly
based on “self-help” procedures by the casualties, this is
unlikely to represent a major confounding factor.
Conversely, the exclusive use of local responder agencies
would potentially decrease variation because of differences
in operational response and so increase the statistical power
for discriminating effects between the treatment groups.
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this study is the first to quantify the
operational and clinical effectiveness of combined dry and
wet decontamination protocols for mass casualty chemical
incidents and the first to specifically address the efficacy of
hair decontamination. The exercise was successful in
demonstrating the practical utility and operational
effectiveness of the revised (PRISM) response process and
in confirming the general clinical efficacy of each protocol
for hair and skin decontamination.
The most effective strategy was the triple combination of
dry, ladder pipe, and technical decontamination (dry
decontaminationþladder pipe system decontaminationþ
technical decontamination), which was significantly
superior to controls at all sites that were initially exposed to
the simulant (hair, scalp, right palm, and chest).
Correspondingly, it would be prudent to recommend that
this be adopted as the standard approach to mass casualty
decontamination. The other decontamination treatments
(with the exception of dry decontamination) were also
effective in that there was an average removal of greater
than 97.3% of chemical contaminant from hair and skin
surfaces.
The apparent ineffectiveness of dry decontamination
was due to the noncompliance of 2 volunteers within the
treatment group. When these 2 outliers were removed from
the analysis, the average amount of contaminant removed
was greater than 99% and so was equivalent in performance
to the other decontamination methods and in agreement
with a previous study evaluating an absorbent wound
dressing against the same contaminant (methyl
salicylate).16 It is possible that the noncompliance was a
consequence of the communication problems reported by
the volunteers and exercise players because dry
decontamination is effective when performed under
controlled conditions but less effective in the absence of
explicit guidance and instructions.22 Therefore,
improvements in the delivery and quality of responder
communication should be investigated to ensure that
casualties receive more effective supervision during the dry
decontamination process; the importance of good
communication has been highlighted previously.23 During
an incident response, it may be beneficial to instruct
casualties to repeat the dry decontamination process until
wet decontamination facilities become available. Aside from
providing a distraction, propagation of the process may
improve casualty compliance and so reduce potential
variability in effectiveness. Inadvertent spreading of the
simulant to the left palm, left cheek, abdomen, and lower
back was occasionally observed (Figure 2). However, where
present, the amounts of simulant recovered from
nonexposed areas of decontaminated individuals were
trivial (<1 mg per site, equating to <140 ng/cm2).
Addition of the disrobe and dry decontamination stage
to the conventional incident response should have little
operational effect because it is a parallel process (performed
simultaneously by all casualties) that can be readily
performed before the availability of a functional ladder pipe
system decontamination corridor. The durations of ladder
pipe system decontamination and technical
decontamination prescribed under the PRISM guidance are
15 and 90 seconds, respectively, which equates to a total
wet decontamination duration of 105 seconds (1.75
minutes). Previous guidance recommended 30 seconds to 3
minutes for ladder pipe system decontamination3,13 and up
to 3 minutes for technical decontamination,11 representing
a combined wet decontamination duration of 3.5 to 6
minutes. Therefore, the PRISM incident response is
theoretically 2 to 3.5 times faster. A previous exercise
performed under similar conditions demonstrated that the
PRISM ladder pipe system decontamination protocol was
2.3 times faster than the conventional ladder pipe system
decontamination protocol.12 Given that the duration of the
PRISM technical decontamination protocol is half that of
the conventional approach, adoption of the PRISM
guidance should at least double the throughput of casualties
undertaking disrobe and triple decontamination. Clearly, a
major incident involving several hundred casualties would
require a scaled-up response (involving multiple ladder pipe
system decontamination corridors and technical
decontamination units) to ensure that all casualties can be
processed within an acceptable time.
The integration of a dry decontamination step into the
initial operational response provides a focus for casualties
and the opportunity for first responders to start
communicating advice while providing reassurance and
situational information. The latter may be of benefit in
reducing anxiety and increasing the cooperation of
casualties during an incident.24 Good communication will
also be important for providing reassurance that dry
decontamination provides a tangible clinical benefit: the
average response from ambulatory volunteers whose

Annals of Emergency Medicine 681
 treatment included dry decontamination consistently
indicated a perception of being unclean (Figure E8,
available online at http://www.annemergmed.com). This
was not unexpected because the concept of dry
decontamination would be considered by many to be
incongruous with cleanliness, especially when compared
with the established paradigm of washing with soap and
water. A further benefit of the dry decontamination stage is
the need to disrobe, which may potentially reduce the urge
for casualties to leave the scene of a chemical incident and
thus improve crowd management. From a clinical
perspective, the disrobe and dry decontamination stage
provides an early intervention that allows casualties
compliant with instructions to remove a significant
proportion (>99%) of liquid contaminants before the
delayed arrival and deployment of resources for wet
decontamination. Moreover, dry decontamination will
eliminate the “rinse-in effect”25-27 associated with wet
decontamination methods that may enhance the dermal
absorption of certain chemicals. However, the potential
lack of compliance observed in this exercise and the
ineffectiveness of dry decontamination against particulate
contamination16 clearly demonstrate that dry
decontamination is not a substitute for wet
decontamination, but should form part of an integrated
response process.
The GPS trackers provided an objective means of
quantifying the time spent by volunteers at discrete stages
of the exercise. The calculated durations represent the time
spent within a general area and so will overestimate the
duration of the actual decontamination processes. Taking
this limitation into account, combined disrobe, ladder pipe,
and technical decontamination required approximately
13.5 minutes per ambulatory person. A comparable
measure for at-risk casualties could not be calculated
because at-risk volunteers did not undergo technical
decontamination during the exercise. However, the average
duration for combined dry and ladder pipe system
decontamination for at-risk volunteers (approximately 29
minutes per person) contrasted poorly with that of the
corresponding ambulatory group (approximately 7.5
minutes) and further emphasizes the need to develop more
effective incident response processes specifically for at-risk
individuals. Such a delay may have a detrimental effect on
the clinical benefit of decontamination for both at-risk and
ambulatory casualties.
Modeling of the GPS tracking data indicated that the
rate at which individuals could proceed through combined
decontamination would peak at approximately 1.2
casualties per minute and then start to decrease. Such a
saturation effect would most likely be due to the
accumulation of at-risk casualties within the
decontamination areas. This is supported by the fact that
at-risk casualties were slower to be processed through dry
and ladder pipe system decontamination. Indeed, it was
observed during the exercise that groups of at-risk casualties
were the last to leave the dry and ladder pipe system
decontamination areas. It is conceivable that the slower
throughput of at-risk casualties is related to the limited
number of fire department personnel available to provide
assistance, a potential issue that was raised at the
postexercise debriefing. Therefore, it seems advisable that
decontamination staffing levels be reviewed to
accommodate the enhanced workload associated with
assisting at-risk casualties.
An interesting outcome of the exercise was the apparent
protective effect of hair. In control (untreated) volunteers,
the recovery of simulant from the hair was approximately
20-fold greater than that from the underlying scalp skin.
This is in agreement with a previous in vitro study, in
which recovery of methyl salicylate from the hair was 36-
fold higher than that from the underlying skin.18
Collectively, these data imply that the face and other
exposed skin areas may be prioritized over the hair and
scalp during dry decontamination.
In conclusion, this exercise demonstrated that PRISM
protocols for mass casualty decontamination are effective;
our findings also support the introduction of an
“immediate disrobe and dry decontamination” stage for
casualties who are waiting for wet decontamination assets
to arrive on scene. However, it is clear that further work is
required to develop more effective processes to accommodate
at-risk casualties; this may necessitate a reappraisal of
staffing levels to provide a sufficient number of responders for
ladder pipe system decontamination. Moreover, there is
a need to develop better communication strategies for first
responders to ensure that decontamination protocols are
performed in an optimal manner.
