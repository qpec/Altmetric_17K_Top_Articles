Pharmacological manipulation of specific neural circuits to optimize the therapeutic index is an 
unrealized goal in neurology and psychiatry. AMPA receptors play key roles in excitatory synaptic 
transmission 1, and their antagonists are antiepileptic 2. Although efficacious, AMPA receptor 
antagonists, including perampanel (Fycompa), the only approved antagonist for epilepsy, induce 
dizziness and motor impairment 3,4.  We hypothesized that blockade of forebrain AMPA receptors that 
spared the cerebellum would be antiepileptic and devoid of motor impairment.  Taking advantage of an 
AMPA receptor auxiliary protein, TARP γ-8, which is selectively expressed in the forebrain and 
modulates the pharmacological properties of AMPA receptors 5, we discovered LY3130481 that 
selectively antagonized recombinant and native AMPA receptors containing γ-8-but not γ-2 (cerebellum) 
or other TARP members.  Two amino acid residues unique to γ-8 determine this selectivity. Antagonism 
was also observed in AMPA receptors expressed in hippocampal tissue from an epileptic patient but not 
in tissue from cerebellum.  Corresponding to this selective activity, LY3130481 prevented multiple 
seizure types in rodents and was devoid of motor side-effects.  These findings demonstrate the first 
rationally-discovered molecule targeting specific neural circuitries for therapeutic advantage.

Perampanel (Fycompa) 2, used to control refractory partial seizures, blocks cerebellar AMPA receptors 
with similar potency and efficacy to hippocampal receptors and induces sedation and ataxia in rodents 
and dizziness and falling in patients 3,4  We developed a high-throughput intracellular calcium dye-based 
assay, FLIPR, to identify compounds that specifically block AMPA receptors associated with TARP γ-8.  
Glutamate stimulated an increase in calcium flux in CHO-S cells transfected with GluA1-Flip (GluA1i) 
alone or co-transfected with GluA1-Flop (GluA1o) and either γ-2 or γ-8. Co-application of glutamate with 
cyclothiazide (CTZ), an AMPA receptor potentiator, enhanced the response (Fig. 1a), consistent with 
established electrophysiological data 5,6.   Detection of large kainate-evoked responses in cells 
expressing GluA1o + γ-2- or GluA1o + γ-8, but not in cells expressing GluA1i alone (Fig. 1b), is consistent 
with increased kainate efficacy in the presence of TARPs 7,8.  GYKI53784, which completely blocks AMPA 
receptor-mediated currents, also blocked calcium influx in all transfections (Fig.  1c).  
We then screened several thousand compounds from the Lilly collection for their ability to block 
glutamate/CTZ-stimulated calcium responses in cells expressing GluA1o+ γ-8.  Active compounds were 
examined in cells expressing GluA1i alone and in cells expressing GluA1o + γ-2 to identify TARP-
dependent and TARP subtype-selective activity, respectively. Subsequent chemical structure-activity 
relationship (SAR) studies led to the discovery of LY3130481 (6-((S)-1-{1-[5-(2-hydroxy-ethoxy)-pyridin-2-
yl]-1H-pyrazol-3-yl}-ethyl)-3- H-1,3-benzothiazol-2-one), which potently blocked GluA1o + γ-8, but not 
GluA1i alone or GluA1o + γ-2 (Fig. 1d, e, g).  Detailed chemical synthesis and the SAR of LY3130481 were 
described elsewhere 9. LY3130481 is not related to any known category or class of compounds in clinical 
use. As previously published 10, GYKI53784 inhibited GluA1 receptors without preference for γ-2  vs. γ-8 
(Fig. 1f).   
We further explored the pharmacology of LY3130481 by voltage clamp recordings. Glutamate 
application on GluA1i-transfected cells evoked inward currents, which rapidly desensitized to a small 
steady-state current, and TARP co-transfection dramatically modified these characteristics 
(Supplementary Fig. 1) 5,11. LY3130481 potently and efficaciously blocked glutamate-evoked currents in 
cells transfected with GluA1i + γ-8 (Fig. 2a). LY3130481 had minimal effect on the other recombinant 
channels with the exception of GluA1i + γ-4 (the closest γ-8 homologue) 5, for which it displayed ~100-
fold lower potency. LY3130481 also had no effect on GluA1i alone or GluA1i + CNIH-2 (another AMPA 
receptor associated protein) 12,13 or + γ-5 (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Fig. 1, Supplementary Table 1a). 
Perampanel blocked AMPA receptors independent of TARPs, as did GYKI53784 (Supplementary Fig. 2, 
Supplementary Table 1b, 1c). LY3130481 potently and efficaciously blocked all γ-8-containing 
 4 
 
homomeric AMPA receptors that display measurable steady-state glutamate evoked currents (GluA1i, 
GluA2i, GluA3i, GluA4i and GluA1o) indicating that the γ-8-specific antagonistic actions were not GluA 
subunit-dependent (Fig. 2a-2e, Supplementary Fig. 3, Supplementary Table 1a). GluA2o, GluA3o, GluA4o 
homomers did not show measurable currents. LY3130481 also antagonized γ-8 containing GluA1/2 
heteromers, the primary AMPA receptor in hippocampal neurons 14 . CNIH-2/3 play a critical role in 
native hippocampal AMPA receptors 15 and LY3130481 potently blocked GluA1/2 heteromers containing 
γ-8 + CNIH-2, whereas it only minimally antagonized CNIH-2-containing AMPA receptors with either γ-2 
or γ-4 (Fig. 2f, Supplementary Fig. 4, Supplementary Table 1a). Since CNIH-2 reduces γ-8 stoichiometry of 
AMPA receptors 16, we wondered whether the partial inhibition was explained by fewer γ-8 molecules 
per AMPA receptor. We therefore trimmed γ-8 stoichiometry using a GluA1i/γ-8 tandem construct co-
transfected with GluA1i or GluA2i 13,16. Indeed, LY3130481 was less efficacious and slightly less potent 
against AMPA receptors with lower γ-8 stoichiometry (Fig. 2g, Supplementary Fig. 4a-f, Supplementary 
Table 1a). LY3130481 antagonized GluA2i + γ-8 less efficaciously than the other γ-8 containing AMPA 
receptors (Fig. 2b). This difference is not likely due to low γ-8 stoichiometry to GluA2i, but the intrinsic 
properties of GluA2i + γ-8 with high-γ-8 stoichiometry (Supplemental Fig. 4a, 4g-i). Hill coefficients (nH) 
for LY3130481 antagonism showed no strong cooperativity in either γ-8 containing AMPA receptors 
(Supplementary Table 1a). Glutamate concentration response curves revealed that LY3130481 displayed 
non-competitive antagonist characteristics (Fig. 2h, Supplementary Table 1d).  
Domain swapping and mutational studies between γ-8 and γ-4 revealed that two amino acids (valine 177 
and glycine 210 in transmembrane domains 3 and 4, respectively) close to the extracellular milieu were 
critical for the selectivity of LY3130481 (Fig. 2i, Supplementary Fig. 5-7, Supplementary Table 1e). Since 
these two amino acids are unique to γ-8 and not present in other Type I TARPs (Supplementary Fig. 6f), 
we generated the corresponding γ-2 point mutants. Consistent with the γ-4 mutants, double amino-acid 
substitution in γ-2 conferred high sensitivity to LY3130481 and the single amino-acid substitutions 
yielded moderate sensitivity to  LY3130481 (Fig. 2k, Supplementary Fig. 8, Supplementary Table 1e).   
LY3130481 antagonized AMPA receptors in hippocampal or cerebrocortical neurons, but not cerebellar 
Purkinje neurons (Fig. 3a, Supplementary Fig. 9a, Supplementary Table 1f). The partial inhibition profile 
of LY3130481 in neurons was comparable to that observed in recombinant AMPA receptors with 
reduced γ-8 stoichiometry, i.e. CNIH-2 containing or GluA1i/γ-8 tandem + GluA (Fig. 2f, 2g, 
Supplementary Table 1a).  Crucially, LY3130481 was not active on hippocampal neurons from γ-8-/- mice 
 5 
 
(Fig. 3b, Supplementary Fig. 9b).  In contrast, perampanel did not show brain region specificity for AMPA 
receptor inhibition (Supplementary Fig. 9c, Supplementary Table 1f) 4.   
LY3130481 also antagonized excitatory synaptic transmission.  In rodent hippocampal slices, LY3130481 
gradually and significantly blocked field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) at Schaffer collateral – 
CA1 synapses  (Fig. 3c-3f), whereas it was inactive in γ-8-/- mice (Fig. 3c, 3d). The slow onset of fEPSP 
blockage by LY3130481 in hippocampal slices (Fig. 3d,e) is likely due to slow LY3130481 penetration into 
the slices (Supplementary Fig. 10). Selectivity analyses of LY3130481 to other receptors, ion channels 
and transporters revealed that LY3130481 did not exhibit significant (>40%) modulation of radioligand 
binding (Supplementary Table 2), and FLIPR assays revealed that LY3130481 did not functionally 
modulate any of kainate, NMDA or metabotropic glutamate receptors (Supplementary Table 3a, 3b). To 
assess LY3130481 effects in vivo, we counted the spikes evoked by either iontophoretically-applied 
AMPA or NMDA in CA1 hippocampal regions of anesthetized rats. Both AMPA and NMDA evoked robust 
and transient spikes. Systemically-administered LY3130481 reduced AMPA-evoked, but not NMDA-
evoked activities in a dose dependent manner (Fig. 3g, h).  Critically, AMPA-evoked spiking activity was 
not antagonized in the rat red nucleus, a brain area, like cerebellum, with very low density of TARP γ-8 
(Supplementary Figure 10). The molecular mechanisms underlying the blockage of γ-8-contatning AMPA 
receptors by LY3130481 is not clear. Pharmacological and biochemical analyses suggest that LY3130481 
does not likely involve dissociation of γ-8 from AMPA receptors (Supplementary Fig. 12) 
Oral administration of LY3130481 potently and dose-dependently suppressed the clonic convulsions 
induced by pentylenetrazole (PTZ) in rats (ED50=1.7 mg/kg) (Fig. 4a). No motor deficits were observed up 
to 100 mg/kg (Fig. 4b). In contrast, GYKI52466 and perampanel were anticonvulsant (Fig. 4a) only at a 
dose that produced profound motor impairment (Fig. 4b). LY3130481 and perampanel also functioned 
as an anticonvulsant in rodents fully sensitized to repeated daily exposure to electrically-induced 
seizures (kindling) via the basolateral amygdala (Fig. 4c), without any noted motoric changes after 
LY3130481 dosing in the epileptic animals.  Notably, and in contrast to perampanel, LY3130481 
produced small increases in locomotion, fitting γ-8-/- mice showing hyper-locomotor activities 17 (Fig 4d). 
The anticonvulsant effects of LY3130481 were abolished in γ-8-/- mice, whereas the anticonvulsant 
effects of GYKI52466 and perampanel remained (Fig. 4e). Perampanel (1 and 2 mg/kg) induced tremor, 
ataxia, running, bouncing, and tonic-clonic forelimb seizures with falling in mice with kainate-induce 
mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, effects not observed in non-epileptic mice 18.  Therefore, we conducted 
two experiments to evaluate effects of LY3130481 in epileptic mice.  Mice with kainate-induced mesial 
 6 
 
temporal lobe epilepsy exhibited 16.3 + 1.3 spontaneous recurrent hippocampal paroxysmal discharges 
and these were completely eliminated 15 minutes following treatment with LY3130481 (6 mg/kg, i.p).  
In mice kindled with PTZ (45 mg/kg, s.c., every other day) for 5 days, the percentage of mice exhibiting 
clonus was 83.0 + 7.3 (n=24) on day 8.  Both LY3130481 (10 mg/kg, i.p.) and perampanel (30 mg/kg, i.p.) 
significantly reduced kindled seizures (Fig 4f).  However, perampanel but not LY3130481 engendered 
motor impairment in naïve and PTZ-kindled mice (Fig 4f, insert).   LY3130481 also engendered a 
qualitatively different motor signature in mice than perampanel, with increases in ambulations and 
vertical movements, whereas, perampanel decreased these behaviors (Fig.4g).  . We next reconstituted 
AMPA receptors from hippocampal tissue obtained from an epileptic patient into Xenopus oocytes 4.  
These AMPA receptor currents were dose-dependently attenuated by LY3130481 (Fig. 4h, i), whereas 
comparable AMPA currents from the human cerebellum were not (Fig 4j). Perampanel blocked AMPA 
currents in both cortex and cerebellum {Zwart, 2014 #2859}. 
This work illustrates the engineering of a selective modulator of forebrain function based on a specific 
auxiliary protein for a receptor regulating fast synaptic transmission Although there are marketed drugs 
that interact with auxiliary subunits of other ion channels (e.g. gabapentin for the α2δ subunit of 
voltage-gated calcium channels and sulfonylurea drugs for the SUR subunit of KATP channels), neither the 
drugs nor their mechanisms of action were rationally designed nor directed towards regional circuits. 
Recent studies show that several neurotransmitter receptors contain auxiliary subunits 5,19. Systematic 
screening of compounds that selectively target auxiliary proteins as described here will enable 
identification of chemicals that selectively modulate brain areas involved in disease while minimizing 
side-effects.  Since neuronal receptors can associate with a range of auxiliary proteins that have 
differential localization and functional controls over specific neural circuits, the current strategy has far-
reaching consequences.

Online Methods 
FLIPR screening   Inhibition of glutamate-stimulated activation of AMPA receptors was determined in 
CHO-S cells (InVitrogen) that transiently express human GluA1 and TARPs. For GluA1-γ-8 transfection, 
we constructed the plasmids expressing human GluA1o and human γ-8 bi-cistronically using pBudCE4.1 
vector (Thermo Fisher), and co-transfected it in CHO-S cells with human EAAT3 cDNA in a ratio of 2:3.  
For GluA1-γ-2 transfection of CHO-S cells, bi-cistronically expressing human GluA1o-and human γ-2 
inserted in pBudCE4.1 (Thermo Fisher) was used.  For the TARP-less AMPA receptors, we used human 
GluA1-flip (GluA1i) in pcDNA3.1 (Thermo Fisher). Due to the relatively small dynamic range of calcium 
dyes, we needed to make the FLIPR signals comparable between the AMPA receptors with and without 
TARPs. To solve the issue, we used Flip and Flop isoform for TARP-less and TARP-containing 
transfectants, respectively.  Flip isoforms have greater conductance than Flop isoforms 22, and TARPs 
enhance AMPA receptor functions of both Flip and Flop isoforms 5.  Parental CHO-S cells were grown in 
suspension in 50/50 custom media to a density of 1x107 cells/ml.  50/50 is a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of CD CHO 
(Gibco #10743) and a custom complete media.  The custom complete media was made by adding 0.40 
mg/L tropolone, 5.00 mg/L insulin, 20 mM HEPES, and 0.075% Pluronic® F68 to a custom basal media

15 min. and resuspended in fresh 50/50 custom media at 2x106 cells/ml.  For batch transfection, 2 mg of 
total DNA(s) was used for each liter of cells.  DNA(s) and FreeStyleMAX® (Thermo Fisher cat#16447-500) 
 12 
 
were added to basal custom media (see above) in the proportions of 10 µg total DNA : 10 µl 
FreeStyleMAX® : 1 ml media, to form a DNA complex.  After 15 min., an appropriate volume (20% v/v) of 
DNA complex was added to the prepared cell culture.  Transiently transfected CHO-S cells were 
harvested after 48 hours and frozen in aliquots for later use.  The function and pharmacology of AMPA 
receptors in transfected cells was verified in both freshly prepared and thawed aliquots of cells. Frozen 
transfected CHO-S cells expressing AMPA receptors were thawed and plated in Dulbecco’s Modified 
Eagle Media (DMEM media) (Thermo Fisher, cat# 11960) containing 5% dialyzed Fetal Bovine Serum 
(Thermo Fisher, cat# 26400-036) and 20 mM HEPES at 50,000 cells per well in 384-well Poly-D-lysine 
coated plates (Becton Dickinson, cat#354663) and cultured overnight at 37oC.  On the day of an 
experiment, two fluorescence dye loading buffers were prepared.  Fluo-4-AM dye loading buffer consists 
of 5 µM Fluo-4 AM dye (Molecular Probes, cat# F-14202) in Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) 
containing 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 2.5 mM probenecid (Sigma, cat# P8761), and 5 nM Pluronic® F-127 
(Molecular Probes, cat# P3000MP).  Fluo-4 NW dye loading buffer was prepared by adding 100 ml of 
HBSS containing 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) and 2.5 mM probenecid to one bottle of Fluo-4 NW dye 
(Molecular Probes, high throughput pack, cat# F36205).  Cultured GluA1-γ-8 and GluA1-γ-2 CHO-S cells 
were loaded with Fluo-4 AM dye loading buffer and incubated at 22°C for 2 hr.  GluA1flip CHO-S cells 
were loaded with Fluo-4 NW dye loading buffer and incubated at 37°C for 30 min. followed by 
incubation for 90 min. at 22°C.  Following incubations, the dye loading buffer in the cell plate was 
removed and fresh assay buffer was added.  Assay buffer consisted of HBSS with 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 
2.5 mM probenecid and 4 mM CaCl2.  The assay was initiated by addition of compounds followed 2 
minutes later by addition of glutamate (5 μM final concentration).  Two minutes later, cyclothiazide (20 
μM final concentration) and glutamate (45 μM final concentration) were added.  Changes in intracellular 
[Ca2+] were kinetically recorded by a fluorescence imaging plate reader (FLIPR).  Inhibition of the effect 
of glutamate by test compounds was expressed as a percentage of the responses stimulated by 
glutamate plus CTZ in the presence of test compounds relative to the maximum inhibition defined by 
using 167 µM of GYKI53784, a non-selective AMPA antagonist, and the baseline defined by assay buffer 
alone. The actions of LY3130481 on kainate receptors were evaluated using the HEK293 cells (ATCC) 
stably expressing human GluK2Q. The Fluo-4-AM loaded cells were pre-incubated with 250 μg/ml 
concanavalin A for 30 min.  To evaluate the antagonistic action of LY3130481, we added various 
concentration of LY3130481, and then added 100 μM glutamate. The effect of LY3130481 on NMDA 
receptors was tested using HEK293 cells with human GluN1 / GluN2A or GluN1 / GluN2B cDNA under 
the control of TET-on operator with CMV promotor. The expression of NMDA receptors were induced by 
 13 
 
1 μg/ml doxycycline. To evaluate the potentiator action, we added various concentrations of LY3130481 
and then 0.2 μM glutamate + 2.5 μM glycine. The antagonistic action was evaluated by addition of 
LY3130481 and then 2 μM glutamate + 2.5 μM glycine. To evaluate the effects of LY3130481 on 
metabotropic glutamate receptors, we used AV12 cells (ATCC) stably expressing either of mGluR1, 2, 3, 
4, 5, or 8 with EAAT1. To translate the activation of Gi-coupled mGluRs, mGluR2, 3, 4 and 8, to calcium 
mobilization, we co-expressed with a promiscuous G-alpha protein, Gα15. The cells were loaded with a 
calcium indicator, Fluo-3-AM, Fluo-4-AM or Calcium-5 (Molecular Devices), and measured the change in 
the fluorescent intensity by the additions of 12.5-25 μM of LY3130481 and then glutamate. We used 
EC10 and EC90 concentrations of glutamate to evaluate potentiator and antagonist actions, respectively.  
Chimeric cDNA Constructions   The chimeric γ-8 and γ-4 constructs were engineered out by PCR. The 
junctions of the transmembrane and extracellular / intracellular domains were predicted by the report 
by Burgress 23 and our own sequence alignments. The regions of the designated domains are as follows 
(The number of amino acid residues). γ-8 (human Cacng8), TM1: 1-41, Ex1: 42-129, TM34: 158-228, C-
term: 229-425, TM3: 158-179, Ex2: 180-205, TM4: 206-228. γ-4 (human Cacng4), TM1: 1-30, Ex1: 31-108, 
TM34: 137-207, C-term: 208-327, TM3: 137-158, Ex2: 159-184, TM4: 185-207. Point mutations were 
generated by PCR-based site directed mutagenesis using custom oligonucleotides and Quikchange II kit 
(Agilent Technologies).  GluA1/γ-8 construct was described previously 16. 
Patch Clamp Electrophysiology   Agonist-evoked currents were recorded from transfected HEK293T cells 
(ATCC) and acutely isolated neurons as described 24.  The rat neurons were isolated from 4-10 weeks old 
Sprague Dawley rats. The mouse neurons were from 4-10 weeks old CD-1 mice (γ-8+/+ ) or γ-8-/- mice 25 
that were back-crossed multiple times with CD-1 mice. We used both male and female animals for these 
studies.  Kainate / glutamate ratios were calculated as: 
IKA-steady-state / IGlu-steady-state, 
where IKA-steady-state and IGlu-steady-state are the steady state responses evoked by kainate (1 mM) and 
glutamate (1 mM) application, respectively.   
Resensitization percentage was calculated as: 
IGlu-Resens/ IGlu-steady-state x 100,  
 14 
 
where IGlu-Resens is the current that accrues from the trough of desensitization  15.  We discarded less than 
5% of total recorded the recombinant samples, which did not meet the criteria described in 
Supplementary Fig. 1-4, which validate the expression of the designated AMPA receptors and auxiliary 
subunits. We used all recordings from native neurons with stable and measurable steady-state currents. 
The potency of LY3130481 is calculated as follows. The amplitude of IGlu Steady-state in the presence of 
LY3130481 normalized by that in the absence of LY3130481 was defined it as “Relative IGlu Steady-state”, and 
plotted it as a function of Log10[LY3130481]. The average and SEM of Log10IC50 and efficacy (Imax) are 
calculated using the pooled Relative IGlu Steady-state values recorded from 3-19 cells as indicated in Figure 
Legends using three- or four-parameter sigmoidal curve fit with Prism 6.04 (GraphPad Software Inc.).  
We perfused 5-6 different concentrations of LY3130481 onto each cell. We put zero-drug values, i.e. 
Relative IGlu Steady-state without LY3130481 ( = 1 ), at [LY3130481] = 1 x 10-13 M, which is 3 log unit below 
the lowest LY3130481 concentration tested. We did not constrain either the bottom or top values for 
the curve fitting calculations, so the calculated IC50 is relative IC50, in which halfway between the top 
and bottom plateau. To obtain reliable Hill slopes, we calculated Hill coefficient (nH) when we measured 
more than 12 concentration points.  The potency of glutamate is calculated as follows. We measure the 
IGlu Steady-state without LY3130481 first, and then measure it under the perfusion of a fixed concentration of 
LY3130481 indicated in Fig. 2g.  The IGlu Steady-state in the presence of LY3130481 was normalized by the IGlu 
Steady-state evoked by the initial 1 mM glutamate application without LY 3130481, and plotted as the 
function of Log10[Glu]. We used three-parameter sigmoidal curve fit and calculated the average and 
SEM of Log10IC50 and Emax using the pooled values of Relative IGlu Steady-state recorded from 3 cells for 
each concentration of LY3130481. We tested 4 glutamate concentrations for each cells. We put zero-
glutamate values, i.e. Relative IGlu Steady-state without glutamate ( = 0 ), at [Glu] = 1 x 10-8 M, which is 2 log 
unit below the lowest glutamate concentration tested.  
Field EPSP recordings   Field EPSPs (fEPSPs) were recorded from Schaffer-CA1 synapses of rats or mice 
described above. Parasagittal brain slices (400 µm thick) were prepared from 3-6 weeks old animals 
using Vibroslice (Campden Instruments, London or Leica, Milton Keynes, UK) in carbogenated (95% O2 
and 5% CO2) ice cold slicing solution (concentrations in mM):  NaCl 124, NaHCO3 26, KCl 3, glucose 10, 
CaCl2 0.5, MgCl2 4 with 300-305 mOsm.  The slices are incubated at 30–34oC in carbogenated recording 
solution: NaCl 124, NaHCO3 26, KCl 3, glucose 10, CaCl2 2.3, MgCl2 1.3 with 300-305 mOsm  for 30 
minutes, and then allowed to rest at room temperature for another 30 minutes before recording.  Slices 
were then placed in a submersion type recording chamber (RC-26G, Warner Instruments) mounted on 
 15 
 
an upright microscope (FN-1, Nikon) and continuously superfused (2-3 ml/minute) with carbogenated 
recording solution. A concentric tungsten stimulation electrode and a recording electrode filled with 2 M 
NaCl were placed at stratum radiatum. Test pulses (100 µs pulse width) were applied every 20 s (0.05 
Hz) or 30 s (0.067 Hz). Stimulation intensity was determined to obtain 50~70% of the maximum 
responses that elicit population spikes.  The fEPSP slope after continuous LY3130481 perfusion (28 min 
for 10 µM or 60 min for the other concentrations) was normalized by the baseline, the mean fEPSP slope 
20 min prior to LY3130481 perfusion, and % depression was calculated. We used the data with stable 
baseline. Concentration effect functions were generated and enabled construction of a 
concentration/%depression function with mean + SEM and the estimation of an IC50 value by three-
parameter sigmoidal curve fitting methods within GraphPad Prism 6.04. 
Iontophoretic application of AMPA and NMDA in rat hippocampus or red nucleus   Male Sprague 
Dawley rats (250-350 g body weight) were anesthetized with 1.4 times body weight of 600 mg/mL 
urethane and implanted with a jugular cannula (PE 10 tubing attached to a 30-gauge needle) for 
intravenous (IV) drug administration. Subjects were administered solutions of either LY3130481 (0.1, 0.3 
or 1 mg/kg), GYKI53784 or vehicle (20% Captisol), intravenously. Cannulated subjects were mounted on 
a rat stereotaxic frame, the skull was exposed, and a well opening was created, using a dental drill, at 
the following coordinates:  AP -4.2, ML +2.4 for hippocampus, AP: -5.8 mm, ML: +0.8 – +1.1 mm for red 
nucleus. The dura was then cut, exposing the cortical surface. A 5-barrel micropipette assembly 
mounted onto a Narishige micro-drive was lowered to a depth of DV: 1.8 to 2.6 mm for hippocampus or 
DV: 6.4 to 7.8 mm for red nucleus. The pipette barrels were pre-filled with solutions as follows: Center 
recording barrel: 2 M NaCl; current balancing: 2 M NaCl; ejection vehicle: 190 mM NaCl, pH 8; AMPA: 
1mM dissolved in the ejection vehicle; NMDA: 10 mM dissolved in the ejection vehicle. The pipette was 
slowly lowered to the target depth until a response from a CA1 pyramidal neuron or red nucleus neuron 
could be isolated and held. Signals were amplified by an XCell 3+ differential amplifier (Frederick Hauer 
Corporation). Low frequency cutoff was set to 1000 Hz, high frequency cutoff set to 2000 Hz and gain set 
to 20000. Recordings of the cells’ firing activity were made using Spike2 software. Alternating 
Iontophoretic ejections of AMPA and NMDA were made using a Dagan 6400 Programmable Current 
Generator. Ejections currents were titrated until stable levels of responding to pulses of AMPA and 
NMDA could be established, and then were held fixed. A baseline recording was then made followed by 
recordings of the response to IV administration of eithervehicle, 0.1, 0.3 or 1 mg/kg of LY3130481. Data 
were analyzed using Spike2 software from CED. Cursor placement was used to demarcate AMPA and 
 16 
 
NMDA ejection pulses, and these cursor regions were analyzed for spike frequency across baseline, and 
post-drug administration epochs. Ratios of AMPA to NMDA mean firing rates (MFR) were then 
computed and averaged for each 5-minute time interval post injection, and expressed as percent 
baseline for each drug dose. As variances of percent baseline AMPA to NMDA ratios are not equal as 
they approach 0, data were log transformed (Log10) for further statistical analysis. Statistical evaluation 
of compound-treatment effects were made by one-way ANOVA for repeated measures. Transformed 
values for each 5-minute effect mean, post injection, was treated as a repeated time measure. When 
significant p-values from ANOVA were revealed Dunnett’s within-group dynamic multiple comparisons 
were evaluated to compare the effects of vehicle and drug dose treatments. 
Microtransplantation of brain membrane to Xenopus Oocyte Membranes    Frozen samples of human 
hippocampus and cerebellum were obtained from Oregon Brain Bank (Portland, Orego, U.S.A.) and 
Analytical Biological Services Inc. (Wilmington, Delaware, U.S.A.), respectively. The hippocampal sample 
was from a patient suffering from epilepsy, the cerebellar sample was from a control donor. Brain 
samples were kept frozen at -80°C and transport of the samples from the USA to the UK took place on 
dry ice. Membrane preparations from these tissues were prepared according to the method developed 
and described by 26-28. In short: 0.1 – 0.5 g of tissue was homogenized in ice-cold glycine buffer 
(concentrations in mM: 200 glycine, 150 NaCl, 50 EGTA, 50 EDTA, 300 sucrose) to which 10 µl protease 
inhibitor cocktail (Sigma) was added per ml glycine buffer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 4°C for 
15 min at 9500 g. The supernatant was subsequently centrifuged at 4°C for 2 hrs at 100,000 g with an 
ultra-centrifuge and the pellet was re-suspended in ice-cold assay buffer (5 mM glycine). The protein 
concentration of the membrane preparations were measured using the Pierce BCA protein assay kit 
(Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, U.S.A.) and were around 3 mg/ml. Aliquots of the suspensions were 
kept at -80°C and were thawed just before injection into Xenopus oocytes. Xenopus oocytes (stage V-VI) 
were removed from schedule I sacrificed frogs and defolliculated after treatment with collagenase type I 
(5 mg/ml calcium-free Barth’s solution) for 4 h at room temperature. 60 nl of membrane suspension was 
injected per oocyte using a Drummond (Broomall, PA, U.S.A.) variable volume microinjector. After 
injection, oocytes were incubated at 18°C in a modified Barth’s solution containing (concentrations in 
mM):  NaCl 88, KCl 1, NaHCO3 2.4, Ca(NO3)2 0.3, CaCl2 0.41, MgSO4 0.82 , HEPES 15 and 50 mg/l 
neomycin (pH 7.6 with NaOH; osmolarity 235 mOsm). Experiments were performed on oocytes after 2-5 
days of incubation. Oocytes were placed in a recording chamber (internal diameter 3 mm), which was 
continuously perfused with a saline solution (concentrations in mM):  NaCl 115, KCl 2.5, CaCl2 1.8, MgCl2 
 17 
 
1, HEPES 10, pH 7.3 with NaOH, 235 mOsm) at a rate of approximately 10 ml/min. Dilutions of drugs in 
external saline were prepared immediately before the experiments and applied by switching between 
control and drug-containing saline using a BPS-8 solution exchange system (ALA Scientific Inc., Westbury, 
NY, U.S.A.). Between responses oocytes were washed for 2 min. Oocytes were impaled by two 
microelectrodes filled with 3 M KCl (0.5 – 2.5 MΩ) and voltage-clamped using a Geneclamp 500B 
amplifier (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA, U.S.A.). The external saline was clamped at ground 
potential by means of a virtual ground circuit using an Ag/AgCl reference electrode and a Pt/Ir current-
passing electrode. The membrane potential was held at -60 mV. The current needed to keep the 
oocyte’s membrane at the holding potential was measured. Membrane currents were low-pass filtered 
(four-pole low-pass Bessel filter, -3 dB at 10 Hz), digitized (50 Hz), and stored on disc for offline 
computer analysis. Data are expressed as mean ± SEM. Experiments were performed at room 
temperature. For the inhibition curves, ion currents were evoked by switching from control solution to a 
solution containing 100 µM AMPA and 30 µM cyclothiazide (CTZ). After 5 min of AMPA/CTZ perfusion 
the solution was switched to AMPA/CTZ plus various concentrations of LY3130481 for 5 min. Inhibition 
was calculated from the current amplitude at the end of LY3130481 application and the current 
amplitude of the AMPA/CTZ response just before LY3130481application.. The potency of LY3130481 is 
calculated as follows. The steady-state current amplitude evoked by AMPA + CTZ in the presence of 
LY3130481 was normalized by that in the absence of LY3130481, and was plotted as the function of 
Log[LY3130481]. We used three-parameter sigmoidal curve fit method in Prism 6 software to calculate 
the IC50.  
Selectivity assay by radioligand displacement   This assay was conducted by Cerep (Celle-Lévescault, 
France). The membrane fraction from rat brain or cells with heterologously-expressed recombinant 
receptors was incubated with the radioligand shown in Table 2 in the presence or absence of 1 or 10 μM 
LY3130481 for 30-120 min at 4oC, RT or 37oC.  The binding reaction was terminated with rapid filtration, 
and the radioactivity retained on the filters, which is defined as total binding, were measured with a 
scintillation counter. Non-specific binding was determined by including excess concentration of cold 
competitors shown in Table 2. Specific binding was total binding subtracted by non-specific binding. The 
percent inhibition of specific binding by LY3130481 was calculated as: 
100 – (Specific binding in the presence of LY3130481 / Specific binding in the absence of LY3130481 x 
100) 
 18 
 
Measurement of LY3130481 concentration in hippocampal slices   Transverse hippocampal slices 
(400 µm thick) were prepared from 3-6 weeks old Sprague Dawley rats and allowed to rest at room 
temperature in carbogenated  recording solution: NaCl 124, NaHCO3 26, KCl 3, glucose 10, CaCl2 2.3, 
MgCl2 1.3 with 300-305 mOsm for 30 min as described above. The slices were transferred into a 
chamber with 1 μM LY3130481 in carbogenated recording solution. Ten slices (30-60 mg hippocampal 
tissue) were removed from LY3130481-containing solution washed with ~50 ml of carbogenated 
recording solution three times, and stored at -80oC. The slices were homogenized in 300 μl of 
water/methanol (4:1, v/v). Stock solutions containing 1 mg/ml of LY3130481 were diluted to produce 
working solutions which were then used to fortify control brain homogenate to produce calibration 
standards with concentrations ranging from 1 to 5000 ng/ml. Aliquots of each study sample, calibration 
standard, and control sample were then transferred to 96-well plates, mixed with acetonitrile/methanol 
(1:1, v/v) containing an internal standard to precipitate sample proteins, and centrifuged. The resulting 
supernatants were subjected to liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry analysis using 
an Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex API 4000 (Foster City, CA) equipped with a TurboIonSpray interface, 
and operated in positive ion mode. The analytes were chromatographically separated with a gradient 
liquid chromatography system and detected and quantified with selected reaction monitoring (M+H)+ 
transitions specific to LY3130481, m/z 383.1 > 232.1. The free fraction of LY3130481 was measured by 
mixing placing mixttures of LY3130481 and brain into a dialysis block with buffer on the other side. After 
4.5-h incubation, the samples were taken from both sides. Fraction unbound is calculated by dividing 
the LC/MS/MS area of the buffer side by the LC/MS/MS area of the protein side. 
General statistical considerations:  in vitro data   Experiments with the FLIPR system were conducted 
blind and with randomization.  All other in vitro experiments were semi-randomized without blinding to 
condition. Group sizes were prospectively determined on the basis of previous publications assessing 
concentration response curves 29. Decisions regarding statistical analyses were based upon the nature of 
the data, distributions, homogeneity of variance, and other statistically-validated criteria.  All data for 
ANOVA were evaluated for normally-distributed functions and the statistical analysis was handled 
accordingly as noted. All data are provided with estimated variation which is taken into account in 
statistical treatments. Specific cases are described in the figure legends and table captions.  Data 
exclusion on occasion was determined by a priori and statistically-accepted outlier analyses as described 
in Patch Clamp Electrophysiology section.  
 19 
 
 Animal studies    Studies were performed according to the guidelines set forth by the National Institutes 
of Health and implemented by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Eli Lilly and Company and 
collaborative research institutes.  All rodents used in this report were male.   Group sizes were 
determined by a priori experience in the labs in which they were conducted as appropriately powered to 
identify standard of care anticonvulsant and motor-impairment.  Animals were randomly-assigned to 
treatment groups by independently drawing animals from their housing cages.  For animal studies, the 
experimental observers were blinded to the treatments.  In all studies, homogeneity of variances were 
assessed to determine the proper statistical treatment.  For quantal data, no variances were created; 
data were replicated to assure reliability of findings as noted in figure captions. 
Pentylenetetrazole-Induced Seizures   We administered LY3130481 (orally) or GYKI52466 
(intraperitoneally) 30 min before subcutaneous PTZ dosing (35 mg/kg) to evaluate their ability to 
prevent or dampen seizures induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats (90-100 g, ~5 weeks old). The rats 
were used at this weight so as to better accommodate them on the inverted-screen test described 
below.  After dosing, animals were observed for 30 minutes after PTZ for clonus (defined as clonic 
seizure of forelimbs and hindlimbs during which the mouse demonstrates loss of righting). The dose of 
PTZ was based upon estimated ED90 values for PTZ in these assays. The percentage of rats protected 
from seizure induction was assessed across doses from no effect to full protection and the data were 
analyzed by Fisher’s Exact probability test as per typical for quantal data.  Comparable studies were 
conducted in male, TARP γ-8 -/- and γ-8+/+ mice 17.  Mice were treated as described for rats above except 
that they were given 70 mg/kg PTZ. 
Pentelentetrozole (PTZ)-induced kindled seizures and motor impairment assessments.  Male, CD1 
mice were given PTZ (45 mg/kg, s.c.) every other day as described30.  Mice were dosed on days 1,3, and 
5 and then divided into groups of 8 or 9 and tested on day 8 with either PTZ alone (45 mg/kg, s.c.), 
perampanel (30 mg/kg, i.p., 30 min prior) + PTZ, or LY3130481 (10 mg/kg, i.p., 30 min prior) + PTZ.  Mice 
were then observed for 30 min for the occurrence of convulsions.  Behavioral observations were 
conducted by a blinded but trained observer using a 3-point rating scale where 0 = no difference to 
vehicle side-by-side; 1 =reduced  movement and/or  slight gait abnormality; and/or leaning  as 
exemplified by 100 mg/kg lamotrigine, i.p., 30 min prior; 2 = more severe aspects of rating #1 that can 
include falling as exemplified by 500 mg/kg valproate, i.p. ., 30 min prior; and 3 = marked impairment, 
including periodic or complete loss of righting – exemplified by 1000 mg/kg valproate, i.p., 30 min prior.  
Seizure data were statistically evaluated by comparing seizure prevalence in vehicle-treated mice to 
 20 
 
drug-treated mice with Fisher’s Exact probability test.  Behavioral data were evaluated by ANOVA with 
post-hoc Dunnett’s test. 
Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy model   The MTLE mouse model recapitulates many of the 
characteristics observed in human patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). The MTLE mouse is 
characterized by an initial neurotoxic event, a unilateral intrahippocampal injection of kainic acid (KA) 
into the dorsal hippocampus, which induces non-convulsive SE lasting several hours. This initial event is 
followed by a latent phase. Two to three weeks after KA injection, spontaneous recurrent hippocampal 
paroxysmal discharges (HPD) are only recorded in the epileptic hippocampus and remain stable and 
stereotyped for the whole life of the animal 18,31. These HPDs occur spontaneously about 30-60 times 
per hour when the animals are in a state of quiet wakefulness, generally last 15-20 sec and are 
associated with behavioral arrest and/or mild motor automatisms.  Adult, male C57/Bl6 mice were 
stereotaxically injected with kainate (1 nmol in 100 nL) and implanted with 1 bipolar electrode in the 
dorsal hippocampus, and then allowed to recover for four weeks. A dose effective against 6 Hz-induced 
seizures of LY3130481 was then evaluated in 4 MTLE mice.  Each mouse was used as their own control 
(vehicle). Digital EEG recordings were performed on freely moving animals for a 20 min pre-injection 
reference period and 90 min post dosing. Data were analyzed for the period of 10 min before and 10 
min after peak time of effect of LY3130481 as observed in the 6 Hz model (15 min).  Any accompanying 
effect on animal behavior was recorded.  Data are presented as the raw number of HPDs during the 
analyzed 20 min period (10 min before and 10 min after) and expressed as a mean + S.E.M. and were 
statistically evaluated by Student’s t-test.  
Inverted Screen Test   Sedative/ataxic effects were evaluated as described. Briefly, 30 minutes after 
LY3130481 application, but before dosing the animals with PTZ, an inverted screen test was carried out 
as described 4. The apparatus is made of six 11 cm × 14 cm (mouse) or four 13 cm × 16 cm squares (rat) 
of round hole, perforated, stainless steel mesh (18 holes/square inch, 3/16-inch diameter, 1/4-inch 
staggered centers, 50% open area) that are mounted 15 cm apart on a metal rod, 35 cm above the 
tabletop. On the day before the test, mice were placed on the screen, and the rod was rotated 180° over 
2 to 3 seconds. The amount of time it took for the test subject to climb to the top of the screen was 
recorded. For the test subjects that hung on the bottom for the maximum of 60 seconds, a 60-second 
score was recorded. A test with compound on board was studied the next day in the same manner. 
Animals were dosed orally with the LY3130481 or intraperitoneally with GYKI52466 and returned to 
their home cage. Twenty-five minutes after pretreatment, the animals were tested on the inverted 
 21 
 
screen and were scored after 60 seconds as follows: 0 = climbed over, 50 = hanging on to screen, and 
100 = fell off. After the inverted screen test, animals were dosed with PTZ in a volume of 1 ml/kg and 
placed in an observation cage (40.6 × 20.3 × 15.2 cm) with a floor containing 0.25 inches of wood-chip 
bedding material.  Mean + SEM data were analyzed by ANOVA and individual contrasts were evaluated 
by post-hoc Dunnett’s test. 
Locomotor activity assessments.  Male,CD1 mice, were injected (i.p.) with vehicle, LY3130481 or 
perampanel and then evaluated for locomotor activity changes for 45 min post dosing.  Activity was 
accessed in a translucent polypropylene (40.6 x 20.3 x 15.2 cm, no bedding) cage. Distance traveled and 
vertically-directed behaviors were measured by the breaking of photobeams (San Diego Instruments).  
Data were analyzed by ANOVA followed by post-hoc Dunnett’s tests.  Adult, male Wistar rats (4-8 month 
old) were anesthetized and surgically prepared with an abdominally implanted miniature transmitter 
(PDT4000 Starr Life Sciences) that permitted chronic recording of body motion32,33. Locomotor activity of 
the rat in it’s individual home cage was monitored by telemetry signals detected using a radio–telemetry 
receiver located beneath the cage (ER-4000, Minimitter, Bend, OR) and activity of the animal tracked 
continuously for 19 hours. The accumulated counts were collected using SCORE-2004 software and 
compared to vehicle controls. Statistical significance was calculated by analysis of covariance (ANOVA) 
using the corresponding pre-dose baseline period as the covariate. Drug mediated effects were 
measured following oral administration of LY3130418 or perampanel.  
 
Amygdala kindling   Male Wistar rats were prepared with bipolar electrodes aimed at one hemisphere 
of the basolateral amygdala (AP -2.2 , ML -4.8, DV -8.5 mm, relative to bregma) for electrical stimulation 
and EEG recording.  After post-operative recovery, electrical kindling begins, where a subthreshold 
constant current (400µA, 1 ms, monophasic square-wave pulses, 60 Hz for 1 sec) is given once a day 
Monday-Friday for about 4-6 weeks until a rat is fully kindled.  These rats began kindling at ~9 weeks of 
age at ~300g.  At the time of testing with LY3130481, the animals were ~26 weeks old and 450-500g. A 
fully kindled rat has experienced 10 consecutive stage 5 seizures or 10 of its last 12 were stage 5 
according to the Racine Scale 34.  Of the 12 fully kindled rats so created, eight rats were selected and 
randomized to initial compound treatment groups. On test day rats were dosed LY3130481 (i.p.) 30 
minutes prior to stimulation with 400µA current.  The percentage of the eight rats not exhibiting 
seizures was assessed post stimulation.  Valproic acid (300 mg/kg, i.p.) was used as a positive control.  
These quantal data were analyzed with Fisher’s Exact probability test for significance at p<0.05.

Immunoprecipitation   GluA2 antibody (NeuroMab, clone L21/32) was covalently conjugated onto the 
magnetic beads with Protein A and Protein G as follows. Equal volume (80 μl each) of Dynabeads Protein 
A and Protein G (Life Technologies) were washed with PBS and then incubated with 20 μg of the GluA2 
antibody for >8 h with gentle mixing at 22oC. The beads were washed with citrate-phosphate buffer at 
pH 5.0, and then with 0.2 M triethanolamine pH 8.2. The antibodies on Protein A/G were cross-linked 
with 20 mM DMP (dimethyl pimelimidate x 2 HCl) in 0.2 M triethanlamine, pH 8.2 for 30 min at 22oC. 
The reaction was chased by the incubation with 50 mM Tris pH 7.5 for >15 min. The beads were washed 
by PBS containing 0.01% Tween-20. Post-nuclear P2 pellet from 1 g of rat hippocampi was prepared as 
described in 24. The P2 pellet was resuspended in x20 original tissue volume of PBS, and aliquoted 2 ml 
each. Add an AMPA receptor antagonist at the concentration with maximum inhibition in the aliquot 
(LY3130481:  10 μM, GYKI: 40 μM, NBQX: 20 μM).  Solubilize the membrane by the incubation with 1% 
CHAPS at 4oC for 1 h, and then remove the unsolubilized materials by centrifugation at 100,000 x g at 
4oC for 1 h. The resultant lysate was incubated with the magnetic beads with the anti-GluA2 (1 μg 
antibody) for 2-3 h. The beads were washed three times with PBS + 1% CHAPS containing the 
corresponding AMPA receptor antagonist. The immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted with 20 μl of 
Laemmli buffer without reducing reagent at 55oC for 30 min to minimize the antibody contamination 
from the beads. The eluted samples were reduced with DTT after transferred into new tubes, and then 
were subjected to immunoblotting with anti-GluA1 (Millipore, AB1504), anti-γ-8 (Frontier Institute, 
TARP-g8 Rb Af1000), or anti-TARP (Upstate, 07-577) antibodies.

Supplementary Figure 1   LY3130481 potently blocked glutamate-evoked steady-state currents in cells 
with GluA1i + γ-8, but not with GluA1i + the other TARP or CNIH-2. (a) Traces of glutamate- or kainate-
evoked currents in HEK293T cells co-transfected with GluA1i alone or GluA1i and an auxiliary subunit as 
indicated. See Fig 2a for concentration-response curves (CRC). Glutamate application evoked rapid 
inward current, which desensitized and reached steady-state as long as glutamate was applied. The 
glutamate application induced resensitization, i.e. gradual increase of desensitized glutamate-evoked 
currents, in γ-4, γ-7 and γ-8 co-transfectants as published 1. We also show the summaries of the 
amplitude of glutamate-evoked steady state currents (b), IKA / IGlu steady-state ratio (c) and resensitization 
indices (See Methods) (d) recorded from the cells used for the CRCs in Figure 2A. We verified co-
transfection of auxiliary subunits as follows. γ-2: large (>200 pA) glutamate-evoked steady-state currents 
(b) and high kainate efficacy (IKA/IGlu steady-state) (c) 2-4, γ-3: high kainate efficacy (c) 5, γ-4, γ-7, γ-8: 
Resensitization 1 (d), CNIH-2: Large (>200 pA)glutamate-evoked currents (b) 6. The averaged amplitude 
of steady-state glutamate-evoked currents for GluA1 alone was ~40 pA (b) 7 and did not reach 150 pA.

curves for inhibition of glutamate-evoked currents by GYKI (b) or perampanel (e). The potencies of 
GYKI53784 and perampanel to γ-2- or γ-8-containing GluA1i were somewhat higher than GluA1i alone 
(See also Supplemental Table 1b and 1c) 8. (c, f) Co-transfection of γ-2 or γ-8 in panel a, b, d and e was 
verified by larger (>200 nA) glutamate-evoked steady-state currents than GluA1 alone (30~40 pA).   
Supplementary Figure 3   LY3130481 blocked γ-8-containing AMPA receptors without GluA subunit 
selectivity   Glutamate-evoked currents in HEK293T cells co-transfected with GluA2i, GluA3i, GluA4i or

Supplementary Figure 4   LY3130481 blocked γ-8 containing GluA1/2 heteromers, and the stoichiometry

currents in HEK293T cells  co-expressing indicated AMPA receptors and their auxiliary subunits,

application (c) with rectification index, IGlu (-80 mV) / IGlu (+40 mV) (d), resensitization index (e) and the 
amplitude of glutamate-evoked steady state currents (f) measured from the recordings used for the 
CRCs in Fig 2e and 2f. TARP incorporation was verified by the high IKA / IGlu steady-state ratio (b) 3-5,9,10. 
Efficient GluA2i incorporation in the heteromers was verified by linear I-V relationships (c, d) 11,12. CNIH-
2 incorporation with γ-8 was verified by no resensitization and high IKA / IGlu steady-state ratio (b, d) 1. 
Formation of the AMPA receptors with low γ-8 stoichiometry by co-expression of GluA1i/ γ-8 tandem 
construct with GluA was verified by no resenstization and larger IGlu steady-state (b, f) 9,10. Linear I-V 
relationship and high IKA / IGlu steady-state ratio were also used for the verification in the subset of the 
recorded cells 10. This figure is associated with Fig. 2e, 2f. (g) Co-expression of CNIH-2 with GluA2i and γ-
8 further reduced efficacy of LY3130481 compared to GluA2i + γ-8, which is similar to GluA1i shown in 
Fig. 2f. (h, i) The summary of IGlu / IKA ratio and resensitization profiles of the individual transfectants 
used for the CRC shown in (g).   Co-expression of all of GluA2i, γ-8 and CNIH-2 in GluA2i + γ-8 + CNIH-2 
transfectatns was confirmed by larger IKA / IGlu ratio than GluA2i + CNIH-2 (h) and lack of resensitization 
(i). LY3130481 showed lower efficacy in GluA2 + γ-8 (Fig. 2b) compared to the other AMPA receptor 
subunits associated with γ-8 (Fig. 2a, 2c-2e). Reducing γ-8 stoichiometry on AMPA receptors by either 
co-expression of CNIH-2 or using GluA1/γ-8 tandem construct also lowered the efficacy of LY3130481 
(Fig. 2f, 2g). The low LY3130481 efficacy on GluA2 + γ-8 could be explained by lower γ-8 stoichiometry 
on GluA2 than on GluA1. However this possibility is not likely. GluA2 + γ-8 displayed resensitization 
(Supplementary Fig. 3a, 4i), which is the signature response of the AMPA receptor with high-
stoichiometric γ-8 10. Co-expression of CNIH-2 with GluA2 + γ-8 eliminated resensitization but retained 
high IKA/IGlu ratio (h, i), which is the signature of AMPA receptors with low stoichiometric γ-8 10, and this 
further reducted LY3130481 efficacy (g, Supplementary Table 1a). These observations strongly suggest 
that GluA2 + γ-8 forms GluA2 with high-stoichiometric γ-8, and the lower LY3130481 efficacy in GluA2 + 
γ-8 is due to intrinsic properties of the channel complex.  
Supplementary Figure 5   TM3 and TM4 in γ-8 additively contribute to the potent antagonist 
properties of LY3130481 (a) Traces of glutamate-evoked currents recorded from heterologously 
 3 
 
expressed GluA1i + designated TARP or γ-8 / γ-4 chimeras perfused with LY3130481. (b) The amplitudes 
of steady-state currents evoked by glutamate are shown (logarithmic scale). All chimeras showed much 
larger current amplitude than GluA1i expressed alone. (c) Resensitization indices for chimera are shown. 
All chimeras with GluA1i yielded similar resensitization profiles as the parental γ-8 and γ-4, but much 
larger than GluA1i alone. These observations confirm that chimeras confer TARP properties comparable 
to γ-8 and γ-4 (b, c). (d) Concentration response curves (CRC) of LY3130481 for the chimeras 
coexpressed with GluA1i. Relative amplitudes of glutamate-evoked steady-state currents are plotted as 
a function of LY3130481 concentration. (e) The potency of LY3130481 for each chimera is shown by IC50 
values with schematic representation of the chimeras. Swapping either TM3 or TM4 from γ-8 with those 
from γ-4 resulted in partial reduction in potency. When TM3 and TM4 form γ-4 were replaced with those 
from γ-8 similar potency values to γ-4 were seen. Error bars indicate SEM. Parentheses indicate the 
number of the recorded transfectants. *; p<0.001 compared to GluA1 + γ-8, #; p<0.001 compared to

evoked currents through GluA1i co-expressed with γ-4 / γ-8 chimeras under perfusion with LY3130481 at 
designated concentrations. (b) The amplitudes of steady-state currents evoked by glutamate are shown. 
All chimeras gave much larger current amplitude than GluA1i alone. (c) The extents of resensitization for 
all chimeras were similar to γ-4 and γ-8, but were much larger than GluA1i alone. All chimeras 
modulated AMPA receptor functions as well as γ-8 and γ-4 (b, c). (d) Relative amplitudes of glutamate-
evoked steady-state currents are plotted as a function of LY3130481 concentration. (e) The potency of 
LY3130481 was shown by IC50. Swapping either γ-4 TM3 or TM4 with γ-8 partially restored the potency.

SEM. Parentheses indicate the number of the recorded transfectants.  *; p<0.001 compared to GluA1 +

Supplementary Figure 7    The two amino acids uniquely located in TM3 and TM4 of γ-8 regulated the 
potency of LY3130481 (a, b) Traces of glutamate-evoked currents through GluA1 co-expressed with γ-8 
(a) or γ-4 (b) point mutants under perfusion with LY3130481 at the designated concentrations. The 
amplitudes of steady-state currents and the extent of resensitization evoked by glutamate are shown 
 4 
 
below the traces. All mutants gave much larger current amplitude and resensitization than GluA1i alone. 
These observations confirm that the point mutants have TARP functions. (c, d) Relative amplitudes of 
glutamate-evoked steady-state currents through GluA1i with γ-8 mutants (c) or with γ-4 mutants (d) are 
plotted as a function of LY3130481 concentration. (e, f) The amino-acid sequences of the γ-8 (e) and γ-4 
(f) point mutants tested for the potency and efficacy of LY3130481 in Fig. 2i and 2j.  
Supplementary Figure 8   LY3130481 blocks glutamate-evoked currents through GluA1i co-expressed 
with γ-2 with substitutions of critical amino acids   (a) The amino-acid sequences of the γ-2 point 
mutants tested for the potency and efficacy of LY3130481 in Fig. 2k (b) Traces of glutamate-evoked 
currents through GluA1 + γ-2 point mutants under the perfusion with LY3130481.  (c) The amplitudes of 
steady-state currents and the ratios of IKA to IGlu are shown . All of these γ-2 point mutants have TARP 
functions, since they gave much larger current amplitude and IKA/IGlu than GluA1i alone 2-4. (d) Relative 
amplitudes of glutamate-evoked steady-state currents through GluA1 with γ-2 mutants are plotted as a 
function of LY3130481 concentration.  The summary of the potency values is shown in main Fig. 2j. Error

Supplementary Figure 9   Brain region specific and γ-8-dependent action of LY3130481 in acutely 
isolated rodent neurons (a) Typical traces recorded from acutely isolated rat neurons associated with 
Fig 3a. All glutamate-evoked responses under this experimental condition were blocked by GYKI 53784 
(40 µM), indicating they were AMPA receptor-mediated. LY3130481 blocked responses in hippocampal 
and cortical neurons but not in Purkinje neurons. This panel is associated with Fig 3a. (b) Representative 
traces recorded from acutely isolated hippocampal neurons from γ-8+/+ or γ-8-/- mice. The concentration-
dependent blockade of AMPA receptor-mediated responses by LY3130481 was abolished in γ-8 deficient 
mice. This panel is associated with Fig 3b. (c) Glutamate-evoked responses recorded from acutely 
isolated rat neurons from hippocampus, cortex and cerebellar Purkinje cells in the presence of various 
concentrations of perampanel.   Complete current blockage by high concentration of GYKI and 
perampanel confirmed the glutamate-evoked responses in this condition were fully AMPA receptor-
mediated 14. (d) CRCs for the inhibition of glutamate (1 mM)-evoked steady-state currents by 
perampanel on acutely-isolated rat neurons   No brain-region selectivity was observed.

Supplementary Figure 10   Gradual blockage of hippocampal field EPSP by LY3130481 seems due to its 
slow penetration into the slices.  (a) LY3130481 quickly blocked AMPA receptor mediated responses in 
the hippocampal neurons isolated from hippocampus. Traces showing the time course of the blockage 
of glutamate-evoked responses by LY3130481. Note that the glutamate-evoked responses were fully 
AMPA receptor-mediated, as GYKI53784 completely blocked the response. (b) Summary of the relative 
amplitude of the glutamate-evoked steady-state currents recorded from 3 isolated hippocampal 
neurons plotted as a function of time after the perfusion of 0.1 μM LY3130481 shown in a. The time 
constant was calculated by fitting with one-phase decay curve. Note that the antagonistic action of 
LY3130481 is fairly quick (τ = 0.2 min) for isolated neurons, which are free from physical barriers such as 
glia and/or connective tissues. (c) The time course of the LY3130481 penetration into the hippocampal 
slices   The slices were prepared with the same procedure as that for fEPSP recordings shown in Fig. 3C 
and 3D, and soaked in the carbogenated buffer with 1 μM LY3130481. The slices were sampled at 
various time points, and weighed. The total concentration of LY3130481 in each samples were measured 
(Left Y axis). Since the free fraction of LY3130481 in brain tissues were ~1%, we calculated the 
approximate concentration of free LY3130481 in hippocampal slices and showed at right Y axis. The time 
constant was calculated by fitting with single-phase decay curve. It took quite long for LY3130481 to 
penetrate into brain slices (τ = 52 min) (n = 2). The kinetics of LY3130481 penetration fits well with that 
of fEPSP blockage shown in Fig3c2 and Fig 3d1. In addition, the approximate concentration of free 
LY3130481 in hippocampal slices roughly fitted with the extent of IGlusteady-state and fEPSP inhibition (Fig. 
3a, 3b, 3d2). We concluded that the slow action of LY3130481 on the fEPSP recorded in hippocampal 
slices were due to the slow onset of compound penetration.  
Supplementary Figure 11   Systemically administered LY3130481 did not block AMPA- or NMDA-
evoked firing in the red nucleus. (a) A multi-barrel glass recording micropipette as inserted into the red 
nucleus area of anesthetized rats, and extracellular potentials were recorded with alternating 
iontophoretic applications of AMPA and NMDA. Firing rate and field potential were plotted as a function 
of time. We chose the red nucleus for the in vivo recording as this region expresses both γ-8 lacking 
AMPA receptors and functional NMDA receptors 15. Cerebellar neurons were not readily amenable for 
recording under these conditions, since NMDA receptors in Purkinje neurons are at minimum level 16. 
Red nucleus neurons show high frequency spontaneously firing as shown consistent with previous 
reports 17,18. The firing rate was increased by iontophoretic applications of AMPA and NMDA.  (b) The 
ratio of the AMPA- to NMDA-evoked firing rate was not changed by 1 or 3 mg/kg LY3130481, doses 
 6 
 
which efficaciously suppressed AMPA-evoked hippocampal firing. GYKI53784 significantly decreased the 
AMPA to NMDA ratio of evoked firing (main Fig. 3e). (c) The γ-8 mRNA level in the red nucleus is below 
detectable levels (Allen Brain Atlas database).  
Supplementary Figure 12   The mechanism of TDAA action is not likely the result of  LY3130481-
stimulated dissociation of γ-8 from AMPA receptors (a) (Top panels) Sequentially-recorded traces of 
glutamate and kainate-evoked currents from GluA1 + γ-8 expressing cells before, during and after the 
application of LY3130481. (Bottom panels) Traces of glutamate-evoked currents from GluA1, GluA2 + γ-8 
and GluA2 with or without LY3130481 (b) Resensitization indices of glutamate-evoked currents before 
and after the application of LY3130481   LY3130481 reduced the resensitiztion for both GluA1 and GluA2 
with γ-8. Error bars indicate SEM. Parentheses indicate the number of the recorded transfectants. 
Asterisk indicates p<0.01 with paired t-test. (c, d) Steady-state current amplitudes evoked by glutamate 
before and after the application of LY3130481 for GluA1 ± γ-8 (c) or GluA2 ± γ-8 (d) are compared with 
those for GluA1 or GluA2 alone. Note that the residual currents after the maximum inhibition by 
LY3130481 were significantly larger than GluA1 or GluA2 alone. Error bars indicate SEM. Parentheses 
indicate the number of the recorded transfectants. The inhibition by LY3130481 is statistically analyzed 
with paired-t-test. The comparison of γ-8 containing AMPA receptor with LY3130481 and AMPA 
receptor alone is performed with unpaired t-test.  Asterisk indicates p<0.05.  Error bars indicate SEM. 
Parentheses indicate the number of the recorded transfectants. Asterisk indicates p<0.001 with Turkey’s 
test. (e) IKA / IGlu ratios of GluA1 + γ-8 during and after LY3130481 are compared with GluA1 alone. The 
characteristics of the residual currents from γ-8-containing GluA1 or GluA2 after LY3130481 applications 
were very different from GluA1 or GluA2 alone (c-e). Error bars indicate SEM. Parentheses indicate the 
number of the recorded transfectants. (f) GluA1-containing protein complexes were 
immunoprecipitated from rat forebrain membrane fractions, and immunoblotted with GluA1 and TARPs. 
The ratio of co-immunoprecipitated γ-8 or γ-2/3/4 to GluA1 was not changed by LY3130481 or other 
AMPA receptor antagonist, GYKI or NBQX. There was no evidence that LY3130481 dissociates γ-8 from 
AMPA receptors.

Values are listed when the R2 of fitted curves were larger than 0.6. Hill coefficients (nH) were calculated by 4-parameter 
sigmoidal curve fit, only when we measured more than 12 concentration points. The rest of CRCs were fitted with 3-parameter 
sigmoidal curve fit, in which nH is fixed to -1. Group-to-group statistical significance was evaluated by ANOVA and then Tukey’s 
test (multiple groups) or unpaired two-tailed t-test (two groups). Statistical comparison of Imax is performed among γ-8 
containing AMPA receptors only, because the CRCs for the AMPA receptors with the other TARPs did not reach plateau even at 
the highest LY3130481 concentration.  A p<0.001 compared to GluA1i + γ-8, B p<0.05 compared to GluA1i + γ-4, C p<0.001

LY3130481 did not affect mGluR functions. All mGluR functions were determined by intracellular calcium mobilization by FLIPR as described in 
Method / FLIPR screening section. Gi-coupled mGluRs were co-transfected with promiscuous Gα, Gα15 cDNA to translate the mGluR activation 
to calcium mobilization. The percentages of potentiation and inhibition in the presence of LY3130481 at the indicated concentrations are 
shown.
