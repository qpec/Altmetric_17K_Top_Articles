Background
Access to mobile phones continues to increase exponentially globally, outstripping access to fixed telephone lines, fixed computers and
the Internet. Mobile phones are an appropriate and effective option for the delivery of smoking cessation support in some contexts.
This review updates the evidence on the effectiveness of mobile phone-based smoking cessation interventions.
Objectives
To determine whether mobile phone-based smoking cessation interventions increase smoking cessation in people who smoke and want
to quit.
Search methods
For the most recent update, we searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialised Register in April 2015. We also searched
the UK Clinical Research Network Portfolio for current projects in the UK, and the ClinicalTrials.gov register for ongoing or recently
completed studies. We searched through the reference lists of identified studies and attempted to contact the authors of ongoing studies.
We applied no restrictions on language or publication date.
Selection criteria
We included randomised or quasi-randomised trials. Participants were smokers of any age who wanted to quit. Studies were those
examining any type of mobile phone-based intervention for smoking cessation. This included any intervention aimed at mobile phone
users, based around delivery via mobile phone, and using any functions or applications that can be used or sent via a mobile phone.
Data collection and analysis
Review authors extracted information on risk of bias and methodological details using a standardised form. We considered participants
who dropped out of the trials or were lost to follow-up to be smoking. We calculated risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals
(CI) for each included study. Meta-analysis of the included studies used the Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect method. Where meta-analysis
was not possible, we presented a narrative summary and descriptive statistics.

 Main results
This updated search identified 12 studies with six-month smoking cessation outcomes, including seven studies completed since the
previous review. The interventions were predominantly text messaging-based, although several paired text messaging with in-person
visits or initial assessments. Two studies gave pre-paid mobile phones to low-income human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive
populations - one solely for phone counselling, the other also included text messaging. One study used text messages to link to video
messages. Control programmes varied widely. Studies were pooled according to outcomes - some providing measures of continuous
abstinence or repeated measures of point prevalence; others only providing 7-day point prevalence abstinence. All 12 studies pooled
using their most rigorous 26-week measures of abstinence provided an RR of 1.67 (95% CI 1.46 to 1.90; I2 = 59%). Six studies verified
quitting biochemically at six months (RR 1.83; 95% CI 1.54 to 2.19).
Authors’ conclusions
The current evidence supports a beneficial impact of mobile phone-based smoking cessation interventions on six-month cessation
outcomes. While all studies were good quality, the fact that those studies with biochemical verification of quitting status demonstrated
an even higher chance of quitting further supports the positive findings. However, it should be noted that most included studies were
of text message interventions in high-income countries with good tobacco control policies. Therefore, caution should be taken in
generalising these results outside of this type of intervention and context.

Can programmes delivered by mobile phones help people to stop smoking?
Background
Mobile phones are being used more to support healthy lifestyles. We wanted to know whether they could be used to support people to
stop smoking. We reviewed the evidence on the effect of quit smoking programmes delivered by mobile phones to people who want
to stop smoking.
Study characteristics
We found 12 studies up to April 2015 that could be included. These studies included 11,885 people who were monitored to see if they
managed to quit smoking and if they were still quit six months later.
Key results
When the information from all the studies were combined, smokers who received the support programmes were around 1.7 times more
likely to stay quit than smokers who did not receive the programmes (9.3% quit with programmes compared with 5.6% quit with no
programmes). Most of the studies were of programmes relying mainly on text messages.
Quality and completeness of the evidence
We are moderately confident in the findings of this review. However, all studies took place in high-income countries and mainly used
text messages, so these results may not hold true in people from poorer countries or with other types of mobile phone programmes.
There were no published trials of smartphone ’apps’ to help people stop smoking that met the inclusion criteria.

 B A C K G R O U N D
This is the second update of a review of the evidence on the ef-
fectiveness of mobile phone-delivered smoking cessation support.
Since the previous review, the use of mobile phones globally has
continued to increase at an exponential rate, far exceeding access
to the Internet or fixed telephone lines in many regions. The Inter-
national Telecommunications Union (ITU) estimated that there
were more than seven billion mobile phone subscriptions in 2015;
approximately 96.8 per 100 inhabitants, ranging from 120.6/100
in high-income countries to 91.8/100 in low-income countries.
Access to mobile broadband is also growing fast, with an estimated
47% of the world’s population subscribing to mobile broadband,
compared with the 29% who have fixed broadband subscriptions
(ITU 2015). The smartphone (mobile phone with a computer
operating system) is fast becoming the computer of choice, or at
least the most accessible computer, in many countries. It is re-
ported that about 45% of global mobile phone subscriptions are
associated with smartphones and that, with 75% of new sales of
mobile phones being smartphones, this will continue to increase
(Ericsson 2015).
Mobile phones are increasingly useful in health information and
healthcare delivery around the world. Text messaging has been
used for health service appointment reminders, preventive activi-
ties and medication adherence (Free 2013). Mobile phones have
also been used in monitoring and the self management of chronic
disorders such as diabetes (Holtz 2012). In addition, smartphone
applications for health and wellness are proliferating, although
there is little published research in this area (Abroms 2011).
Smokingcessationservicesinternationallyare usingmobile phones
to deliver support, particularly as adjuncts to other services. In
2014, the UK’s National Health Service rolled out text messaging
integrated into routine clinical practice and in 2013 almost half
of US quitlines offered text messaging in addition to phone coun-
selling services (Abroms 2015). The potential benefits of mobile
phone-based smoking cessation interventions include: the ease of
use anywhere at anytime; cost-effective delivery and scalability to
large populations, regardless of location; the ability to tailor mes-
sages to key user characteristics (such as age, sex, ethnicity); the
ability to send time-sensitive messages with an ’always on’ device;
the provision of content that can distract the user from cravings;
and the ability to link the user with others for social support.
It is likely that the use of mobile phones for smoking cessation
will continue to grow as they become even more ubiquitous and
as technological advances increase the number of applications and
functions available. While mobile technology continues to change,
it is important to review the body of research on interventions
using mobile phones regularly to support people to stop smoking.
This is particularly so, given the exponential increase in access to
mobile phones in high-income countries (ITU 2015), where the
burden of tobacco-related morbidity and mortality is predicted to
be greatest (Jha 2014).

want to quit.
M E T H O D S
Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
Randomised or quasi-randomised trials.
Types of participants
Any smokers who want to quit smoking.
Types of interventions
We included studies that examined any type of mobile phone-
based intervention for smoking cessation. This included any in-
tervention aimed at mobile phone users, based around delivery
via mobile phone, and using any functions or applications that
could be used or sent via a mobile phone. We excluded trials where
mobile phones were seen as an adjunct to face-to-face or Inter-
net-based programmes, such as to remind participants of appoint-
ments or where the effects of the various components of a multi-
faceted programme could not be separated.
Types of outcome measures
The primary outcome was smoking abstinence at six months or
longer from the start of the intervention. When available, we pre-
ferred sustained abstinence to point prevalence abstinence and bio-
chemically validated results to self report.
Search methods for identification of studies
For the present update of the review, we searched the Specialised
Register of the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Review Group in
April 2015 using the terms ’mobile phone’, ’cell phone’, ’txt’, ’pxt’,
’sms’, or ’mms’ in the title, abstract or keyword fields. The Spe-
cialised Register includes reports of possible controlled trials of
smoking cessation interventions identified from sensitive searches
of databases. At the time of the search, the Register included the
results of searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled
trials (CENTRAL; 2015 Issue 3); MEDLINE (via Ovid, to update
13 March 2015), EMBASE (via Ovid, to update week 12 2015)
and PsycINFO (via Ovid; to 23 March 2015). See the Cochrane
Tobacco Addiction Module in The Cochrane Library for full search

 strategies and a list of other resources searched. We also searched
the UK Clinical Research Network Portfolio for current projects
in the UK and the US ClinicalTrials.gov register for ongoing or re-
cently completed studies. We searched through the reference lists
of identified studies and attempted to contact the authors of on-
going studies.
We placed no restrictions on language or publication date.
Data collection and analysis
Selection of studies
The Tobacco Addiction Group Trial Search Co-ordinator pre-
screened the titles and abstracts of records identified from the
Register search to exclude reports that had no relevance to the
topic and to provide a list of potentially relevant citations. Two
review authors (RW, YG) identified potentially eligible studies and
obtained full-text copies. The same review authors independently
selected studies to be included against the criteria listed above
and resolved any disagreements by discussion, by contacting study
authors, or by referring to a third review author (HM) to act
as arbiter where required. We recorded reasons for exclusion of
studies.
Data extraction and management
We extracted the following methodological details from the in-
cluded study reports and presented them in the Characteristics of
included studies table. Two review authors (RW, YG) indepen-
dently extracted data using a standardised form. Articles were not
blinded for authors, institution and journal, because the review
authors who performed the quality assessment were familiar with
the literature. If an article did not contain enough information on
methodological criteria, that is, if one or more of the risk of bias
criteria were scored ’unclear’, we contacted the trial authors for
additional information.
Characteristics of study participants
• Definition of smoking status used in the study.
• Age and any other recorded characteristics of study
participants.
• Inclusion criteria.
• Exclusion criteria.
Interventions used
• Type and ’dose’ of mobile phone intervention used.
• Type of control used.
• Duration of intervention.
• Length of follow-up.
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
We also extracted information on the following criteria from in-
cluded studies.
• Method of randomisation.
• Presence or absence of blinding to treatment allocation
(non-blinded/open label, single blind, double blind, triple blind).
• Quality of allocation concealment (adequate, unclear,
inadequate, not used).
• Number of participants randomised, excluded and lost to
follow-up.
• Whether an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis was carried
out.
• Whether a power calculation was reported.
• Duration, timing and location of the study.
Measures of treatment effect
We recorded the information below where available.
• Definition of smoking cessation as used in the study.
• Smoking cessation rates at four weeks (self reported
abstinence or biochemically verified abstinence, or both).
• Smoking cessation at rates at six months (self reported
abstinence or biochemically verified abstinence, or both).
• Smoking cessation rates at final follow-up (if follow-up
greater than six months and where these data were available).
We calculated risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI)
for each outcome for each included study.
Dealing with missing data
We regarded those trial participants who dropped out of the trials
or were lost to follow-up as continuing to smoke according to the
Cochrane Tobacco Group’s guidelines.
Data synthesis
We conducted a meta-analysis of the included studies, using the
Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect method to pool RRs. This pooling
method was chosen given the undesirable weighting properties of
random-effects models when small studies are present (Peto 2013).
In the presence of substantial statistical heterogeneity as assessed
by the I2 statistic (Higgins 2003), we planned to evaluate possible
explanations for this heterogeneity using subgroup analyses.

 The previous review (published in 2012) included five studies
from the 68 initially identified (Borland 2013; Free 2009; Free
2011; Rodgers 2005; Whittaker 2011). For this update of our
review, the literature search identified 37 new studies. Many were
unrelated and were immediately excluded, leaving 21 potentially
relevant papers. Some of these were not focused around delivery
via mobile phone (Fraser 2014; Mehring 2014; Peng 2013; Skov-
Ettrup2013; Stanczyk 2014); one was not randomised (Pechmann
2015); one was a pilot study with only two-month follow-up (
Bricker 2014); four only followed participants up to three-months
(Buller 2014; Mehring 2014; Shi 2013; Vilaplana 2014); one was
investigating gradual reduction of smoking in pregnant women,
ratherthanquitting(Pollak 2013); andone comparedtailoredwith
untailored text messages (Skov-Ettrup 2014) (see Discussion).
Approaching authors of ongoing studies revealed several that were
in the process of being finalised or submitted for publication. We
were able to get data directly from the authors of five studies - two
of which we included(Ferguson 2015; Shelley2015); however, one
study was not eligible, with only three months’ follow-up (Jordan
2015), and a further two were focused on cardiovascular disease
secondary prevention rather than smoking cessation (Chow 2012;
Dale 2014).
Details of excluded and ongoing studies can be found in the
Characteristics of excluded studies and Characteristics of ongoing
studies tables.
In this update, our literature search identified seven new ran-
domised controlled trials (RCT) with six-month outcomes (
Abroms 2014; Bock 2013; Ferguson 2015; Gritz 2013; Haug
2013; Naughton 2014; Shelley 2015).
Included studies
Intervention programmes
Almost all of the included trials used text messaging (SMS) as a
central component of the intervention. A major exception to this
was Gritz 2013 who gave pre-paid mobile phones to participants,
which were usedtoprovide cognitive behavioural andmotivational
counselling, and access to a reactive telephone helpline. The inter-
vention was based on US guidelines around cognitive-behavioural
and motivational interviewing techniques over the mobile phone
(Fiore 2008). Shelley2015 also gave mobile phones to participants
in a three-arm trial comparing standard pharmacotherapy, with
pharmacotherapy plus text messages, and with pharmacotherapy
plus text messages and phone counselling. We included this as
the pre-paid mobile phone was specifically provided as part of the
study to facilitate the interventions (indicating it could not have
been delivered without the mobile phone), and this was very sim-
ilar in concept to the Gritz 2013 study. Whittaker 2011 sent SMS
containing links to theoretically driven video messages from ’or-
dinary’ role models coping with quitting.
Several studies paired SMS with in-person visits or assessments
(Bock 2013; Gritz 2013, Haug 2013; Naughton 2014; Shelley
2015). The remainder were purely text messaging interventions
(Abroms 2014; Borland 2013; Ferguson 2015; Free 2009; Free
2011; Rodgers 2005; Whittaker 2011).
Many of the studies stated that their interventions were theory
based (Abroms 2014; Bock 2013; Gritz 2013; Naughton 2014;
Whittaker 2011; Haug 2009). In Haug 2013, the intervention was
said to be based on cognitive behavioural components, stages of
change and the social norms approach, with an online assessment
that allowed tailoring based on stage of change and other baseline
data.
Bock 2013 conducted an initial counselling session then ran-
domised participants to an eight-week intervention based on na-
tional guidelines, social cognitive theory and the stages of change.
The programme was tailored to stage of readiness, starting with
either ’not ready’ or ’prepared to quit’, that could change accord-
ing to text message questions and answers. There were also on-
demand components.
The text messaging intervention in Rodgers 2005 was developed
in New Zealand, and later adapted for the UK and tested in a
pilot study (Free 2009), and then a large randomised controlled
study (Free 2011). Messages commenced prior to quitting and
were based on effective brief interventions including quitting ad-
vice and motivational messages. Interactive components included
the ability to text in for more support (in the instance of crav-
ings or lapses) and an optional Quit Buddy in Rodgers 2005. A
cost-effectiveness analysis was also conducted as part of the Free
2011 trial (Guerriero 2013). This showed that the cost of text-
based support per 1000 enrolled smokers was GBP278 per quitter.
When the future health service costs saved (as a result of reduced
smoking) were included, text-based support was considered to be
cost saving, with 0.5 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained
per quitter.
In Borland 2013, participants received offers of support via a per-
sonalised tailored Internet programme, an SMS programme, both
programmes, a choice of all three or a minimal control. The SMS
programme provided advice on strategy and motivational mes-
sages relevant to their stage of readiness for quitting, plus messages
on demand. For the purposes of meta-analyses, we compared the
SMS group with the control group.
In Naughton 2014, the intervention group received the ’usual care’
received by the control group (described below), as well as a four-
page tailored advice report and a tailored theoretically based SMS
message programme for 90 days, with interactive components (i.e.
they could text for help when in difficult situations, or if they had
lapsed).
Control programmes
The control programmes across the studies varied from nothing
(Haug 2013), to fortnightly (Free 2009; Free 2011; Rodgers 2005;
Whittaker 2011) or daily (Bock 2013) text messages, written/

 Internet untailored materials (Abroms 2014; Ferguson 2015; Gritz
2013), and untailored messages, to standard cessation advice and
treatment (Naughton 2014; Shelley 2015).
The control group of Naughton 2014 received support from prac-
tice staff who had received smoking cessation training. This sup-
port included setting a quit date within 14 days, a prescription for
pharmacotherapy, the opportunity for multiple follow-up visits
and routine measurement of carbon monoxide (CO) in expired
breath.
Context and participants
The settings and recruitment methods, and therefore the partic-
ipants, varied considerably across studies. Two studies targeted
young people (Haug 2009; Whittaker 2011). Bock 2013 found
usual in-person recruitment methods slow and shifted to online
recruitment methods during the study. Borland 2013 and Abroms
2014 also used online recruitment via Internet advertisements. In
Abroms 2014, this initially led to some fraudulent participants
who were discovered and disqualified, and extra procedures were
put in place to prevent this from happening again.
Naughton 2014 was set in primary care practices in the UK with
trained smoking cessation advisors providing smoking cessation
advice. The Gritz 2013 study recruited in a human immunode-
ficiency virus (HIV)-positive, multi-ethnic, low-income popula-
tion. Participants in this study were 76% African American, 79%
unemployed, with high levels of depression and other alcohol/
drug problems. Shelley 2015 similarly recruited from urban HIV
clinics in a different region of the US.
Haug 2013 recruited in vocational schools and differed from the
other studies by allowing the inclusion of occasional smokers (at
least four cigarettes in the past month or at least one in the pre-
ceding week). All other studies used a definition related to daily
smoking.
Where recorded, participants in most of the studies had similar
degrees of nicotine dependence, although in Whittaker 2011, the
’Hooked on Nicotine Checklist’ mean scores of 8 indicated a more
highly addicted group (Wellman 2006).
Participants in three trials were younger (mean age 18.2 years in
Haug 2013, 22 years in Rodgers 2005, and 27 years in Whittaker
2011) than in the other trials (means ranged from 30.7 years in
Bock 2013 to 44.8 years in Gritz 2013). Most trials had slightly
more women than men, with the exception of Gritz 2013 with
70% male participants.
The Characteristics of included studies table gives further details
on the included studies.
Risk of bias in included studies
Randomisation was adequate in all trials. Haug 2013 was the only
cluster randomised trial, and recruited via vocational schools. The
vocational school class was the unit of randomisation, stratified by
school and with randomly permuted blocks of four cases.
In all trials except for Borland 2013, participants were not blinded
to treatment assignment, although research staff were blind to
allocation at follow-up data collection. As seen in Figure 1, all
trials but Rodgers 2005 were at low risk of bias in all domains.

 In Rodgers 2005, incentives for providing final follow-up data
differed between groups - one month of free text messaging was
received by the control group on completion of follow-up whereas
the intervention group had already received their month of free
text messaging from their Quit Day and did not receive a fur-
ther incentive at follow-up. This may have caused the differential
loss to follow-up seen at six months (69.4% providing data at six
months in the active group compared with 79% in the control
group), which in turn may have affected the long-term results of
this study. The authors also suggested that some participants in
the control group may have thought their month of free text mes-
saging depended on reporting quitting. This could account for an
unexpected increase in control group participants reporting quit-
ting from six weeks (109 participants) to six months (202 partici-
pants reporting no smoking in the past seven days). Both of these
elements may have potentially led to an underestimation of the
effect of the intervention.
Two papers stated that they had difficulty recruiting their tar-
get sample size (Haug 2013; Whittaker 2011). Both targeted a
younger population and, as a result, did not recruit their target
sample size.
All studies presented long-term outcomes at six months, either
as self reported point prevalence (no smoking in past seven to
28 days) or repeated measures of point prevalence abstinence (
Abroms 2014; Bock 2013; Gritz 2013) (or both), or continuous
abstinence, defined as no smoking since quit day, but with up to
three lapses (Rodgers 2005), or five cigarettes (Free 2009; Free
2011; Whittaker 2011), allowed.
Seven of the trials sought biochemical verification of self reported
six-month abstinence with salivary cotinine (Abroms 2014; Free
2009; Free 2011; Gritz 2013; Rodgers 2005) or expired CO
(Ferguson 2015; Shelley 2015). Those reporting response rates
for verification varied from 39% in Rodgers 2005 to 92% in
Free 2011, with little difference between intervention and control
groups within studies. Of those participants that were tested, 76%
in Abroms 2014 and 72% in Free 2011 were verified as abstinent.
The proportion was lower in Rodgers 2005 (55% in the interven-
tion group and 33.3% in the control group) and Free 2009 (53%
(8/15) in the intervention group and 40% (6/15) in the control
group). Naughton 2014 also verified quitting but only at four-
week and not at six-month follow-up.
All trials conducted ITT analyses, where participants with missing
data were assumed to be smokers. Any differential loss to follow-
up by group can create potential bias when all are inferred to be
smokers. Sensitivity analyses were used to test the effects of other
potential reasons for drop out. Free 2011 and Haug 2013 used
multiple imputation, by using the observed predictors of outcomes
and the predictors of loss to follow-up to impute missing outcome
data.
A further potential source of bias could be any differential use of
other cessation interventions. In Borland 2013, where use of the
studied interventions was low, it is possible that participants were
motivated to try other cessation programmes.
The Characteristics of included studies table provides details of
risk of bias judgements for each domain of each included study.
Figure 1 illustrates judgements for each included study.
Effects of interventions
See: Summary of findings for the main comparison Mobile
phone-based interventions for smoking cessation
Standard ITT analyses are presented here, with all participants lost
to follow-up counted as continuing smokers. This may differ from
how results were presented by the individual studies due to varia-
tions in primary outcomes and in analytic methods used. For ex-
ample, Free 2011 used multiple imputation by chained equations,
and the Bock 2013 paper reported a significant main effect of a two
(treatment groups) x three (time points) generalised estimating
equations (GEE) repeated measures analysis with higher odds of
point prevalence abstinence compared with a control group (odds
ratio (OR) 4.52, 95% CI 1.24 to 16.53). However, individual
time point comparisons did not show significant differences.
Although Naughton 2014 did not find a significant difference in
their primary outcome (of two-week point prevalence) at eight
weeks (45.2% with intervention programme versus 40.3% with
control programme; OR 1.22, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.69), by six
months there was an effect on self reported prolonged abstinence
(15.1% with intervention programme versus 8.9% with control
intervention; OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.09 to 3.01) and using a contin-
uous abstinence measure that included outcomes at four weeks,
eight weeks and six months (11.4% with intervention programme
versus 6.3% with control programme; OR 1.92, 95% CI 1.07 to
3.45).
We undertook meta-analyses on the 12 included studies (Abroms
2014; Bock 2013; Borland 2013; Ferguson 2015; Free 2009; Free
2011; Gritz 2013; Haug 2013; Naughton 2014; Rodgers 2005;
Shelley 2015; Whittaker 2011). First, we pooled all 12 studies
using their most rigorous 26-week measures of abstinence, giving
an RR of 1.67 (95% CI 1.46 to 1.90; 12 studies; 11,885 partic-
ipants; I2 = 59%) (Analysis 1.1; Figure 2). Both the Free 2009
pilot study and the Whittaker 2011 study were underpowered and
individually did not find an effect. When we removed these two
studies from the analysis, the results produced an RR of 1.81 (95%
CI 1.57 to 2.09; I2 = 32%; 10 studies; 11,459 participants). In
addition, we carried out this main analysis, removing Haug 2013,
to see if the result was sensitive to the inclusion of this cluster
randomised controlled trial. However, this had very little impact
on the result (RR 1.69, 95% CI 1.47 to 1.94; I2 = 62%; 11 stud-
ies; 11,130 participants). Due to the amount of heterogeneity de-
tected, we also made a post-hoc decision to re-calculate the main
9

 analysis using a random-effects model. This resulted in an RR of
1.42 (95% CI 1.11 to 1.83; 12 studies; 11,885 participants), and
therefore none of the adjustments had an impact on the interpre-
tation of the results, and none of the sensitivity analyses accounted
for the majority of the heterogeneity.

Subgroup analyses
We thengroupedstudiesaccordingtodefinitionof abstinence used
(continuous abstinence, point prevalence, biochemically verified
or not) and by differences in intervention (text messaging alone,
text messaging plus some form of personal contact and phone
counselling).
Abstinence
Continuous abstinence
We pooled data from the eight studies reporting continuous absti-
nence, with those reporting repeated measures of point prevalence
abstinence used as a proxy for continuous abstinence (Abroms
2014; Borland 2013; Free 2009; Free 2011; Gritz 2013; Naughton
2014; Rodgers 2005; Whittaker 2011). This gave an RR of 1.72
(95% CI 1.50 to 1.98; I2 = 68%; eight studies; 10,679 partici-
pants), with moderate heterogeneity.
Point prevalence
We pooled studies presenting point prevalence abstinence mea-
suresatsixmonthsseparately(Abroms 2014; Bock 2013; Ferguson
2015; Gritz 2013; Haug 2013; Rodgers 2005; Shelley 2015). This
analysis showed a marginally statistically significant effect of inter-
vention programmes over control programmes (RR 1.18, 95% CI
1.03 to 1.35; I2 = 24%; seven studies; 3,888 participants) (Analysis
1.3).
Bock 2013 was a small study early in the acceptability phase of
testing, with a consequently wide CI. Ferguson 2015, Gritz 2013,
and Shelley 2015 had little difference between groups. Haug 2013
andRodgers 2005 favouredthe interventionbutwithout statistical
significance.
Biochemically verified abstinence
We pooled studies that biochemically verified quitting separately
at 26 weeks (Abroms 2014; Ferguson 2015; Free 2009; Free 2011;
Gritz 2013; Shelley2015). This resulted in an RR of 1.83 (95% CI
1.54 to 2.19; I2 = 71%; six studies; 7,360 participants) (Analysis
1.4; Figure 3).

Differences in interventions
Text message alone interventions
When we removed studies with interventions that included in-
person contacts from the main analysis (all studies 26 week out-
comes) in order to examine only those interventions that used text
messaging only, there was no difference in the results (RR 1.69,
95% CI 1.46 to 1.95, I2 = 74%; seven studies; 9887 participants)
(Analysis 2.1) (Abroms 2014; Borland 2013; Ferguson 2015; Free
2009; Free 2011; Rodgers 2005; Whittaker 2011).
Active versus minimal control
We carried out a sensitivity analysis on the main analysis of all
studies’ 26 week outcomes (12 studies). We removed studies with
more active control programmes (of standard cessation practice
- Naughton 2014 and Shelley 2015); however, again this made
minimal difference to the overall result of the pooled analysis (RR
1.66, 95% CI 1.45 to 1.91, I2 = 66%; 10 studies; 11,176 partici-
pants).

Summary of main results
We included seven further studies of mobile phone smoking cessa-
tion interventions meeting our inclusion criteria since the previous
version of this review, giving a total of 12 included studies. The
first systematic review in 2009 showed short-term benefits, but
found no long-term effects, of mobile phone-only interventions.
The second update, with five studies, showed an overall long-
term benefit of mobile phone interventions for smoking cessation,
though there was a high level of statistical heterogeneity in the
pooled result. This update of 12 studies also suggested a positive
effect of mobile phone interventions on smoking cessation at six
months in comparison with ’usual care’, although there was still
significant unexplained heterogeneity. Our findings appeared to
have been strengthened by the highest quality studies, that is, those
studies using stricter outcome definitions, including biochemical
verification. The benefits were large, and similar in size to those
seen using of other effective treatments such as nicotine replace-
ment therapy (Stead 2012).
Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
Our review currently includes 12 studies with 11,885 participants.
There has been a steady increase in the number of studies eli-
gible for this review over time. All of the studies included were
conducted in high-income countries with mature tobacco control
policies; although two studies specifically recruited from low-in-
come populations (Gritz 2013; Shelley 2015). This means that it
is possible that text messaging interventions may not be appro-
priate or effective in other contexts, or alternatively they may be
even more effective in those settings where cessation information
and support is relatively new. Clearly there is a major gap in the
current evidence.
We also found 25 ongoing studies. As the body of evidence sup-
porting the effectiveness of text messaging in high-income coun-
tries grows, it is hoped that some of these are being conducted in
other contexts or with different populations. It is interesting to
note that there were no trials of smartphone ’app’-based interven-
tions that met our eligibility criteria despite the proliferation of
available cessation apps. In 2011, one review of available smoking
cessation apps found them to be lacking in adherence to cessation
guidelines or theory (Abroms 2011).

Mobile phone-based interventions for smoking cessation (Review)

 There is as yet little research into the different functional com-
ponents, message content, mediators and moderators of mobile
phone programmes, in order to learn what type of programmes
work best for whom. Skov-Ettrup 2014 conducted a study, based
on an ongoing online programme, of untailored messages com-
pared with tailored messages. Participants were randomised first
and then offered text messages on top of the online programme.
Overall, there was no significant difference between groups in
long-term quit rates; however, when restricted to only those who
chose to receive the text messages, there was an effect of tailored
over untailored messages (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.08; 1,809
participants). As the tailored messages were also more frequent, it
is not clear whether this effect was due to intensity, tailoring or
both.
Quality of the evidence
The studies included varied in size from 60 to 5800 participants,
but were generally all of a reasonable quality with a low risk of
bias. They were all randomised controlled trials, with one clus-
ter randomised trial (the result of analyses were not sensitive to
removal if this study), and with similar outcomes measures. Sub-
stantial heterogeneity was detected across analyses; however, a post
hoc decision to conduct the main analysis using a random-effects
model resulted in no difference in the interpretation of findings.
Half of the included studies attempted to biochemically verify self
reported quitting outcomes. When we pooled these studies sepa-
rately, the result was similar, if not more strongly in favour of the
intervention.
Two studies reported that they were unable to recruit their target
sample sizes, both of which were targeting a younger population
(Haug 2013; Whittaker 2011). Both studies found no statisti-
cally significant effect of the intervention, but were reported to be
slightly underpowered. More research is needed in young adults
to determine the acceptability and effectiveness of mobile phone
based interventions. Overall, we are moderately confident in the
main effect estimate generated through our analysis (Summary of
findings for the main comparison).

Implications for practice
At least in high-income countries with existing tobacco control
policies, media and education, text message-based smoking ces-
sation interventions, either alone or in combination with face-
to-face assessments or online programmes, appear to be a helpful
option to offer to quitters. It is not yet clear whether this trans-
lates to other contexts, such as low- or middle-income countries,
and younger people; however, many are proceeding to implement
such programmes anyway. High-quality evaluations of these im-
plemented programmes will be valuable.
Implications for research
Research into the effectiveness of mobile phone-based cessation
programmes for young people, in low- and middle-income coun-
tries and countries with little active tobacco control policy, is still
required. There is also a lack of research into the effectiveness of in-
dividual components of programmes, in order to determine what
works best for whom. There does not appear to be any rigorous
trials of smartphone-based programmes published as yet. Due to
their widespread availability, it would be useful to know if the
broader functionality available in apps can be harnessed effectively
to support cessation.

Characteristics of included studies [ordered by study ID]
Abroms 2014
Methods
RCT in US
Participants
503 participants aged ≥ 18 years recruited via online advertisements when Internet
searching for ’quitting smoking’. 34% men, mean age of 35.7 years, and mean FTND
score of 5.3
Eligibility criteria included smoking ≥ 5 cigarettes/day, having an e-mail address, a
mobile phone number with an unlimited SMS plan, an interest in quitting smoking in
the next month and not pregnant
Interventions
Automated bidirectional text messages, personalisation and interactive components, au-
tomated unidirectional emails and an Internet portal - has been revised since pilot study
Text2Quit: a 6-month SMS programme with the first 3 months offering both outgo-
ing messages about quitting smoking and on-demand help using keywords. Outgoing
messages peaked in the period just prior to and following the quit date. Participants
received 5 messages on their quit date and approximately 2/day in the week after the
quit date. Frequency declined in the subsequent weeks to approximately 3/week for the
next 2 months and then < 1/week for the remaining portion of the outgoing phase. After
the outgoing messages stopped, participants could still text at any time for help through
keywords - to reset a quit date (DATE), get help with a craving through a tip or a trivia
game (CRAVE); get a summary of their quitting statistics (STATS) and to indicate that
they had smoked (SMOKED). The SMS were supplemented by a personalised Internet
portal (text2quit.com) and e-mails
Control: sent an Internet link to Smokefree.gov, a leading website with quitting smoking
information run by the National Cancer Institute. Later, once the website began to
offer an SMS programme, a guidebook on quitting smoking was offered via an Internet
link that led participants to a document containing similar advice and information as
Smokefree.gov
Outcomes
Primary outcome: biochemically confirmed repeated point prevalence abstinence, de-
fined as a self report of no smoking in the past 30 days on the 3- and 6-month surveys
and a cotinine level ≤ 15 ng/mL at 6 months
Secondary outcomes: 7- and 30-day abstinence at 1-, 3-, and 6-month follow-up and
biochemically confirmed abstinence at the 6-month follow-up

Saliva was collectedby mail for participants reporting abstinence
at 6 months. There was a low response rate (64.7%) among
participants eligible for providing a saliva sample for biochemical
verification although this did not differ across the groups. Of
those participants who provided a sample, 21 (24.4%) had high
levels of cotinine and were coded as smokers in analyses
Bock 2013
Methods
Pilot RCT in US
Participants
Adults aged ≥ 18 years of age current daily smokers recruited online and eligible if
interested in quitting smoking in the next 30 days, with a mobile phone with SMS text
messaging capability, and using SMS text messaging at least once monthly. 43% men,
mean age 30.7 years (range 18-52 years), and mean FTND of 4.9 (moderate level of
dependence on nicotine)
Interventions
All participants received a single individual 30-minute smoking cessation counselling
session
TXT-2-Quit: an 8-week programme with 1-4 text messages/day (depending on quit
stage). Smoking cessation messages were tailored to the participant’s stage of smoking
cessation, with specialised messages provided on-demand based on user requests for
additional support, and an optional peer-to-peer social support network
Control: an 8-week programme of daily non-smoking related text messages
Outcomes
Primary outcome: 7-day point-prevalence abstinence using a 2 (treatment groups) × 3
(time points) repeated measures design across 3 time points: 8 weeks, 3 months and
6 months; showed a significant main effect for treatment group (P value = 0.02) with
higher odds of quitting in the intervention group compared with the control group
(odds ratio 4.52, 95% CI 1.24 to 16.53). Although there was no individual time point
difference between groups at 6 months (20% with intervention programme vs. 3.6%
with control programme; odds ratio 6.75, 95% CI 0.76 to 60.15) it was likely to have
been affected by reduced statistical power
Secondary outcome: 24-hour point prevalence abstinence at 8 weeks, 3 months and 6
months

Methods
RCT in Australia
Participants
3530 participants in total (control = 422; onQ = 756; QuitCoach = 809; both = 785;
participant choice = 758). 60% female, mean age 42.1 years, and 87.4% were currently
smoking a mean of 16.9 cigarettes/day
Interventions
onQ programme: provides a stream of SMS messages to the person that mixes snippets of
advice on strategy and motivational messages. The user can interact with it by indicating
their stage of quitting so that appropriate stage-specific messages are sent, and once quit
can also call up messages in crisis situations
QuitCoach: a personalised, automated tailored cessation programme delivered via the
Internet. It generates letters of advice based on answers to an assessment questionnaire,
including suggestions about strategy and motivational messages. It also provides further
untailored supplementary resources
Control: brief information on Internet- and phone-based assistance available in Australia
Outcomes
Self reported 6-month sustained abstinence at 7-month follow-up
Intention-to-quit analysis and sensitivity analysis around treatment of missing data
Notes
Only onQ and control arms used in analysis

Methods
RCT in UK
Participants
5800 participants aged ≥ 16 years, willing to make an attempt to quit smoking in the
next month and owned a mobile phone. 45% women, mean age of 37 years, 89% white
and 25% students/unemployed. 60% of participants had an FTND dependence score
of ≤ 5
Interventions
6-month programme: delivered solely over mobile phone based on programme in
Rodgers 2005. Participants asked to set a QD within 2 weeks of randomisation. They
received 5 text messages/day for the first 5 weeks and then 3/week for the next 26
weeks. Intervention included motivational messages and behaviour-change techniques.
The programme was also personalised with an algorithm based on demographic and
other information gathered at baseline, such as smoker’s concerns about weight gain after
quitting. The core programme consisted of 186 messages and the personalised messages
were selected from a database of 713 messages. For instance, by texting the word “lapse”,
participants received a series of 3 text messages that encouraged them to continue with
their quit attempt. Participants could also request the mobile phone number of another
trial participant so that they could text each other for support. Participants in the in-
tervention group using pay-as-you-go mobile phone schemes were given a £20 top-up
voucher to provide sufficient credit to participate in the intervention
Control: fortnightly, simple, short, text messages related to the importance of trial par-
ticipation
Outcomes
No more than 5 cigarettes smoked since the start of the abstinence period at 6 months
of follow-up, self reported and verified by postal salivary cotinine testing or a CO test in
person

Methods
RCT in US
Participants
474 participants aged ≥ 18 years recruited from an HIV clinic in a low-income multi-
ethnic urban population in Texas, USA. 70% men, mean age 44.8 years, mean FTND
5.8
Inclusion criteria: HIV-positive, current smoker (≥ 5 cigarettes/day and expired CO ≥
7 ppm), willing to set a QD within 7 days, and ability to speak English or Spanish
Interventions
Participants in the mobile phone intervention group received the usual care components
plus a mobile phone-delivered counselling intervention over 3 months and access to
a supportive hotline. They were provided with a pre-paid mobile phone on which a
series of 11 proactive counselling sessions were conducted. The phone calls spanned a 3-
month period but were front loaded such that the frequency of the calls was highest near
the time of scheduled quit attempt. Counselling session content was primarily drawn
from a cognitive-behavioural foundation emphasising problem solving and skills training
techniques
Control: participants completed an audio computer-assisted self interview, then received
provider advice to quit smoking. Usual care was provided with targeted written smok-
ing cessation materials (i.e. a “tip sheet” designed to address concerns of HIV-positive
smokers) and instructions on how to obtain nicotine-replacement therapy in the form
of nicotine patches at the clinic
Outcomes
Primary outcome: self reported repeated measures 7-day point prevalence at 3, 6 and 12
months
Secondary outcomes: 3, 6 and 12 months’ smoking abstinence (24 hours, 7 days and 30
days), CO verified quitting, number of quit attempts, length of abstinence (in days), use
of nicotine-replacement therapy, use of other cessation treatments and exposure to other
forms of tobacco. Other smoking-related measures included the FTND, the Reasons
for Quitting scale (intrinsic and extrinsic quit motivation) and the 9-item quitting self
efficacy scale. Depressive symptoms: Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-

Survey (MOS-HIV). Alcohol use: Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test. A single

Notes
Expanded programme based on Vidrine 2006
Varied from the other interventions in using pre-paid provided mobile phones to provide
counselling instead of an SMS intervention. Many smokers were excluded (40%) due to
not meeting 5 cigarettes/day and CO ≥ 7 ppm). Low absolute quit rates may be due to
high nicotine dependence, high rate of alcohol and drug use, and the substantial burden
of mental illness amongst participants

Cluster RCT in Switzerland
Participants
755 daily or occasional smokers (≥ 4 cigarettes in the preceding month and ≥ 1 cigarette
during the preceding week) recruited at 24 vocational schools (178 classes). 48% male,
mean age 18.2 years (SD 2.3)
Interventions
SMS-COACH: a 3-month programme including a weekly SMS text message assessment
of smoking-related target behaviour, 2 weekly text messages tailored to baseline data
and responses to the SMS text message assessments, and an optional further integrated
QD preparation and relapse prevention SMS programme. Participants who did not use

(Continued)
the integrated programme for QD preparation and relapse prevention received a total
of 37 text messages (1 welcome message, 11 assessment messages, 24 tailored feedback
messages, 1 goodbye message). Participants, who used the QD preparation and relapse-
prevention programme for the whole period from 1 week before the scheduled quit date
until 3 weeks afterwards, received an additional 42 text messages
Control: all students in participating classes were invited to participate in an online
health screening survey during a regular school lesson reserved for health education. The
control group did not receive anything else
Outcomes
Primary outcome: 7-day point prevalence smoking abstinence at 6 months
Secondary outcomes: 4-week point prevalence smoking abstinence, the number of
cigarettes smoked/day, stage of change and number of attempts to quit smoking
Notes
The study did not reach the target sample size of 910 participants due to smaller class
size than expected and time restrictions. Nicotine dependence was not calculated but
number of cigarettes smoked/day used as an indicator and outcome variable

Naughton 2014
Methods
RCT in UK
Participants
Participants aged 18-75 years and current smokers (≥ 1 cigarette /day and smoked
within previous 7 days) who were willing to quit within 14 days of randomisation,
recruited in primary care. Primary care practices were those that had smoking cessation
advisors (primary care nurses or healthcare assistants) providing level 2 cessation advice.
Participants were self referred or referred by a health professional. 47% men, mean age 41.

with a mobile phone and familiar with sending and receiving text messages and not
enrolled in another formal smoking cessation study or other cessation programme
Interventions
Intervention: usual care plus a tailored advice report and a 90-day programme of tailored
text messages generated by the iQuit system (number of messages sent each day varied
from 0 to 2, mean/day over 90 days 1.2). The messages were designed to advise smokers
on their quit attempt, provide information about the consequences of smoking and ex-
pectations for quitting, provide encouragement, boost self efficacy, maintain motivation
to quit and remind smokers how to cope with difficult situations
Control: ’usual care’ consisted of routine ’level 2’ smoking cessation advice delivered by
smoking cessation adviser. This included a brief discussion about smoking habits and
history, measurement of expired-air CO, brief advice to quit, setting a QD within the
next 14 days, options for pharmacotherapy, a prescription and arranging a follow-up
visit. Usually the opportunity for multiple follow-up visits was offered
Outcomes
Primary outcome: self reported 2-week point prevalence abstinence at 8 weeks
Secondary outcomes: CO-verified abstinence at 4-week for at least 2 weeks, assessed by
a smoking cessation adviser (a CO reading assessed 25-42 days from QD that was <
10 ppm), self reported 3-month prolonged abstinence at 6 months, 6-month prolonged
abstinence at 6-month follow-up and a strict continuous abstinence measure using all
outcome time points: CO-validated 2-week point prevalence abstinence at 4 weeks, 4-
week point prevalence abstinence at 8 weeks and 6-month prolonged abstinence at 6
months

Outcomes used in this meta-analysis were self reported. Control programme was fairly
intensive, i.e. smoking cessation advice provided in-person

Methods
RCT in New Zealand
Participants
1705 participants aged ≥ 16 years recruited by direct advertising, smoking daily, wanting
to quit within the next month, and were able to send and receive text messages on
their own mobile phone 58% female, median age 22 years, 20.8% Maori (indigenous
population), smoked mean 15 cigarettes/day and mean FTND dependence score 5
Interventions
6-month programme delivered solely over mobile phone. Participant nominated QD
and received regular personalised text messages with advice, support and distraction,
with a countdown to QD, intensive 4 weeks of 5 or 6 messages/day then maintenance
phase of 1 message/2 weeks. Messages selected from database matched to participant
characteristics. Free month of text messaging from QD. Optional Quit Buddy and Text
Crave (messages on demand). Interactive polls and quizzes
Control: 1 text message/fortnight
Outcomes
Primary outcome: point prevalence abstinence (no smoking in past 7 days) at 6 weeks’
post-randomisation (approximates 4 weeks post-QD). Verification with salivary cotinine
in small number of quitters at 6 weeks
Secondary outcome: point prevalence abstinence at 12 and 26 weeks, and continuous
abstinence at 26 weeks

Lost to follow-up: 35 control (95.9%) and 46 intervention (94.
6%) followed up at 6 weeks; but differential loss to follow-up

to incentive being offered to control group for follow-up, may
in turn have affected long-term results of study (by underesti-
mating effect)
Other bias
High risk
The authors suggested that some participants in the control
group may have thought their incentive at follow-up (month
of free text messaging) depended on reporting quitting. This
could account for an unexpected increase in control group par-
ticipants reporting quitting from 6 weeks (109 participants) to
6 months (202 participants reporting no smoking in the past 7

Methods
3-arm RCT in US
Participants
Participants aged ≥ 18 years recruited from large urban HIV clinics in the USA
Inclusion criteria: current patient of the clinics, current or regular smoker (≥ 5 cigarettes/
day), CO ≥ 8 ppm, willing to set a QD within the next 2 weeks, willing to use a mobile
phone and able to read text messages, and eligible to take varenicline
Exclusion criteria: alcohol dependence and active drug abuse, and conditions that would
prevent the use of varenicline
Interventions
Intervention: participants received standard care (see below) and 2 text messages/day
for 12 weeks. 1 message reminding them to take their medication and 1 motivational
message regarding cessation
Control group: received standard care, which consisted of a self help information sheet,
tailored to HIV-positive smokers and an offer of varenicline for 12 weeks according to
the standard dosage schedule. Participants needed to return to the clinic each 4 weeks to
receive further medication. All participants were provided with a pre-paid mobile phone
- the control group received phones to facilitate their ability to call the quit line and
receive text message appointment reminders only
A third arm received standard care, text messages, plus behavioural therapy delivered
via 7 proactive mobile phone-delivered counselling sessions over a 6-week period. These
combined cognitive behavioural therapy and motivational interviewing techniques
Outcomes
Primary outcome: 7-day point prevalence abstinence verified by CO < 8 ppm at 24
weeks, also measured at 1, 4, 8 and 12 weeks

Whittaker 2011
Methods
RCT in New Zealand
Participants
226 participants aged ≥ 16 years recruited by advertising if they were current daily
smokers ready to quit, and had a video message-capable phone. Advertising particularly
targeted young adults. 47% female, 24% Maori (indigenous population), mean age 27
years and appeared to be highly addicted due to the Hooked on Nicotine Checklist mean
scores of 8 (SD 1.9) out of 10
Interventions
Intervention group: received an automated package of video and text messages over 6
months that was tailored to self selected quit date, role model and timing of messages.
Video messages were video diary-style from a selected ’ordinary’ person going through a
quit attempt in advance of the participant. Frequency of messages varied from 1/day in
the lead up to QD, 2/day from QD for 4 weeks, then reducing to 1 every 2 days for 2
weeks and then 1 every 4 days for about 20 weeks until 6 months after randomisation.
Extra messages were available on demand to beat cravings and address lapses. Additional
website for intervention group participants to review video messages they had been sent
(and rate them if desired), change their selected time periods and change (or add to)
their selected role model
Control: also set a QD and received a general health video message sent to their phone
every 2 weeks
Outcomes
Self reported continuous abstinence - no more than 5 cigarettes smoked since the start
of the abstinence period at 6 months of follow-up

RW was co-author of one paper on one of the included studies (Bramley 2005). She was a co-investigator on two included studies (Free
2009; Free 2011), and principle investigator of a further included study (Whittaker 2011).
CB and HM were co-authors of Whittaker 2011.
RB was co-author of one of the trials (Borland 2013), and he led the development of the intervention.
AR was a lead author (Rodgers 2005), and a co-author (Free 2009; Free 2011; Whittaker 2011), on included studies.
HM received honoraria from Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer for speaking at educational events and attending advisory group meetings.
He has also received investigator initiated research funding from Pfizer.

 RW’s institution has received grant money to cover the costs of providing the text messaging intervention for the study described in
Free 2011, and there is a grant pending to develop this intervention further for a different audience. The institution has also licensed
the STOMP intervention described in Rodgers 2005 to HSAGlobal.
All other authors had no other known conflicts of interest.

We have followed the change of policy of the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group, and now report our findings using Mantel-
Haenszel fixed-effect risk ratios rather than as odds ratios. Previously, we had not pooled studies in the presence of substantial statistical
heterogeneity as assessed by the I2 statistic, but in this update of the review, we report pooled results due to the homogenous nature of
the included studies in terms of design, intervention and outcome.
