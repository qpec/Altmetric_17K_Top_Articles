IMPORTANCE Standard dosing of chemotherapy based on body surface area results in marked
interpatient variation in pharmacokinetics, toxic effects, and efficacy. Whether tailored dosing
can improve outcomes is unknown, as is the role of dose-dense adjuvant chemotherapy.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether tailored dose-dense adjuvant chemotherapy improves the
outcomes of early breast cancer compared with a standard 3-weekly chemotherapy schedule.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A randomized, open-label, phase 3 trial of women aged
65 years and younger who had surgery for nonmetastatic node-positive or high-risk
node-negative breast cancer at 86 sites in Sweden, Germany, and Austria between February
20, 2007, and September 14, 2011.
INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomized 1:1 either to 4 cycles of leukocyte nadir–based
tailored and dose-dense adjuvant epirubicin and cyclophosphamide every 2 weeks followed
by 4 cycles of tailored dose-dense docetaxel every 2 weeks, or to standard-interval
chemotherapy with 3 cycles of fluorouracil and epirubicin-cyclophosphamide every 3 weeks
followed by 3 cycles of docetaxel every 3 weeks.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary end point was breast cancer recurrence–free
survival (BCRFS). Secondary end points included 5-year event-free survival (EFS), distant
disease–free survival (DDFS), overall survival (OS), and rates of grade 3 or 4 toxic effects.
RESULTS Among 2017 randomized patients (1006 in the tailored dose-dense group and 1011
in the control group; median [IQR] age, 51 [45-58] years; 80% with hormone
receptor–positive tumors; 97% with node-positive disease), 2000 received study treatment
(�1 cycle of chemotherapy; 1001 in the tailored dose-dense group and 999 in the control
group). After a median follow-up of 5.3 years (IQR, 4.5-6.1 years), 269 BCRFS events were
reported, 118 in the tailored dose-dense group and 151 in the control group (HR, 0.79; 95% CI,
0.61-1.01; log-rank P = .06; 5-year BCRFS, 88.7% vs 85.0%). The tailored dose-dense group
had significantly better EFS than the control group (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.63-0.99; P = .04;
5-year EFS, 86.7% vs 82.1%). The groups did not differ in OS (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.57-1.05;
P = .09; 5-year OS, 92.1% vs 90.2%) or DDFS (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.64-1.08; P = .17; 5-year
DDFS, 89.4% vs 86.7%). Grade 3 or 4 nonhematologic toxic effects occurred in 527 (52.6%)
in the tailored dose-dense group and 366 (36.6%) in the control group.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among women with high-risk early breast cancer, the use of
tailored dose-dense chemotherapy compared with standard adjuvant chemotherapy did not
result in a statistically significant improvement in breast cancer recurrence–free survival.
Nonhematologic toxic effects were more frequent in the tailored dose-dense group.

reast cancer survival has steadily improved during
the past several decades, mainly attributed to the
use of adjuvant systemic therapy.1 The latest meta-
analysis of chemotherapy by the Early Breast Cancer Trial-
ists Collaborative Group on 100 000 randomized patients
revealed that the proportional reductions in mortality
achieved by adjuvant chemotherapy reach up to one-third
and are seen in all patient subgroups, irrespective of age,
tumor size, nodal status, estrogen receptor status of the
tumor, and tamoxifen use.2
The Early Breast Cancer Trialists Collaborative Group
meta-analysis also demonstrated that higher doses of
anthracyclines increase the relative effectiveness of adju-
vant chemotherapy.2 However, dose intensification of
anthracyclines has been limited by the occurrence of cardio-
toxic effects and secondary hematologic malignant neo-
plasms at high cumulative doses. Dose-dense therapy,
defined as delivery of chemotherapy at shorter intervals
without increasing the cumulative dose, was thus suggested
as a means to improve efficacy.3 A meta-analysis of clinical
trials with dose-dense schedules showed a survival benefit
compared with conventional dosing in estrogen receptor–
negative tumors.4
Dosing of most chemotherapy agents is calculated based
on body surface area, which leads to large interpatient vari-
ability of drug clearance and marked interpatient differences
in toxic effects.5 Use of adverse effects as a pharmacokinetic
surrogate for tailoring chemotherapy dose has been sup-
ported by several reports that indicated a positive correlation
of efficacy with hematologic toxic effects.6-8 Tailored chemo-
therapy has been investigated in both adjuvant and neoadju-
vant settings but has not been established in routine care of
patients with breast cancer.9,10
The combination of these 2 concepts, dose-dense and tai-
lored therapy, was initially tested in a feasibility phase 2 trial
of the Swedish Breast Cancer Group.11 Based on the results of
this study, a randomized clinical trial (Pan-European Tailored
Chemotherapy[PANTHER]study)wasinitiatedtocomparetai-
lored and dose-dense chemotherapy vs standard chemo-
therapy for patients with high-risk early breast cancer.
Methods
Study Design
This was an open-label, randomized, multicenter, phase 3
trial conducted at 86 study sites in Sweden, Germany, and
Austria as an academic collaboration between the Swedish
Breast Cancer Group, the German Breast Group, and the
Austrian Breast & Colorectal Cancer Study Group. The trial
protocol (available in Supplement 2) was designed and
approved by a steering committee with representatives
from all 3 groups and was approved by ethics review boards
with jurisdiction for the participating sites and by relevant
health authorities in all countries. All patients provided
written informed consent before inclusion. An independent
data and safety monitoring committee with expertise in
clinical trials and biostatistics was established. The study
was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki and
the principles of good clinical practice. Data were collected
by the Central Data Center at Karolinska University Hospital
in Stockholm, Sweden, and were analyzed as predefined in
the study protocol.
Patients
Eligible patients were women aged 18 to 65 years with histo-
logically confirmed, completely resected invasive primary
breast cancer that was axillary node positive or high-risk node
negative (defined as [1] a tumor that was >2 cm, hormone re-
ceptornegative,andhistologicalgrade3;or[2]inapatientaged
≤35 years) without distant metastases. Patients had to have an
EasternCooperativeOncologyGroupPerformanceStatusscore
of 0 or 1 and no major cardiovascular morbidity or other seri-
ous medical condition.
Main exclusion criteria were previous adjuvant or neoad-
juvanttreatment;positivemarginsaftersurgery;ongoingpreg-
nancy or lactation; abnormal laboratory values precluding
the possibility to safely deliver the cytotoxic agents used in the
study; peripheral neuropathy grade 2 or greater; and previ-
ous or concurrent malignant neoplasms at other sites, except
basal cell carcinoma and/or squamous cell carcinoma in situ
oftheskinorcervix.Patientswithpreviouscontralateralbreast
cancer diagnosed more than 5 years before registration, not
treated with chemotherapy or locoregional radiotherapy, and
without objective signs of relapse could be included. De-
tailed eligibility criteria are listed in the trial protocol in
Supplement 2.
Randomization
Randomization was conducted at 1 central office in each
country using the permuted block method (block sizes 2, 4,
or 6) and was stratified, in addition to country, for center
and estrogen receptor status. Patients were randomly
assigned 1:1 either to 4 courses of tailored dose-dense epiru-
bicin (38-120 mg/m2, with starting dose of 90 mg/m2) and
cyclophosphamide (450-1200 mg/m2, with starting dose of
600 mg/m2) every 2 weeks followed by 4 courses of tailored
dose-dense docetaxel (60-100 mg/m2, with starting dose of
Key Points
Question Does administration of adjuvant systemic
chemotherapy for women with early-stage breast cancer using a
tailored dose-dense algorithm improve breast cancer
recurrence–free survival compared with standard dosing
algorithms?
Findings In this randomized clinical trial of 2017 women with
high-risk early breast cancer aged 65 years and younger, breast
cancer recurrence–free survival rates were 88.7% for tailored
dose-dense chemotherapy and 85.0% for standard chemotherapy
over a median of 5.3 years, a difference that was not statistically
significant.
Meaning A tailored dose-dense algorithm did not significantly
improve breast cancer recurrence–free survival for women with
high-risk early-stage breast cancer.

75 mg/m2) every 2 weeks, or to 3 courses of fluorouracil
(500 mg/m2), epirubicin (100 mg/m2), and cyclophospha-
mide (500 mg/m2) every 3 weeks followed by 3 courses of
docetaxel (100 mg/m2) every 3 weeks. All chemotherapy
was administered intravenously. After the completion of tai-
lored dose-dense epirubicin and cyclophosphamide, there
was a 3-week interval before the start of tailored dose-dense
docetaxel as suggested by the feasibility study,11 leading to
identical total treatment duration in both groups.
Treatment
The dose levels in the experimental group are shown in
eTable 1 in Supplement 1 for tailored dose-dense epirubicin
and cyclophosphamide and eTable 2 in Supplement 1 for tai-
lored dose-dense docetaxel. Dose tailoring was mainly
driven by the nadir values of leukocytes and platelets, evalu-
ated on days 8, 11 or 12, and 14 or 15 after each chemotherapy
cycle. Specific nonhematologic toxic effects such as diarrhea
grade 3 or greater or stomatitis grade 3 or greater were also
dose limiting, as detailed in the dose-tailoring algorithm
(eTable 3 in Supplement 1). In the control group, chemo-
therapy doses were not modified unless severe infection
complications, prolonged myelosuppression, or severe toxic
effects in the liver occurred (detailed in the trial protocol in
Supplement 2).
Bone marrow support with filgrastim (administered
subcutaneously once daily on days 4-11) or pegfilgrastim
(6 mg administered subcutaneously 24 hours after chemo-
therapy) was mandatory in the dose-dense group but
optional in the control group. After a planned interim safety
analysis, primary filgrastim or pegfilgrastim prophylaxis was
also recommended (albeit not mandatory) for the control
group. Oral ciprofloxacin, 500 mg twice daily, was given on
days 5 through 12 as primary prophylaxis during tailored
dose-dense epirubicin and cyclophosphamide administra-
tion and as secondary prophylaxis following an infection
complication during tailored dose-dense docetaxel adminis-
tration. Mesna was given when cyclophosphamide doses
were higher than 1 g/m2 (eTable 1 in Supplement 1).
Patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2
(HER2)–positive disease received adjuvant trastuzumab for 1
year either after the completion of chemotherapy or concur-
rently with taxanes. Following a report from the North Cen-
tral Cancer Treatment Group N9831 trial, the protocol was
amended in October 2007 and recommended trastuzumab
concurrently with docetaxel for all patients with HER2-
positive disease.12
Adjuvant endocrine therapy with tamoxifen or aro-
matase inhibitors was given for at least 5 years to all patients
with hormone receptor–positive disease and was started af-
ter completion of chemotherapy. Ovarian function suppres-
sion with the addition of a gonadotropin-releasing hormone
agonist was considered for patients who continued to men-
struate after chemotherapy.
Postoperative locoregional radiotherapy was adminis-
tered after the completion of chemotherapy and no later than
6 weeks after the last course, according to local guidelines. Af-
ter the end of study treatment, the protocol stipulated fol-
low-up with clinical visits, hematologic and biochemical tests,
and yearly mammograms (detailed in the trial protocol in
Supplement 2).
Outcomes
The primary end point was breast cancer recurrence–free sur-
vival (BCRFS), defined as time from randomization to local,
regional, or distant breast cancer relapse or to death due to
breast cancer. Secondary efficacy end points included distant
disease–free survival (DDFS; time from randomization to dis-
tant metastases or death due to breast cancer), event-free
survival (EFS; time from randomization to breast cancer
relapse, contralateral breast cancer, other malignant neo-
plasms, or death from any cause), and overall survival (OS;
time from randomization to death from any cause). For
event-free patients in any of the defined efficacy end points,
time was calculated from the date of randomization to the
date of the last visit.
Safety was also a secondary end point and was assessed
throughout the study treatment according to the National
Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
Events, version 3.0. The patients were asked to complete
assessments of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) at base-
line before randomization, after 6 weeks (cycle 3 or 4), and at
the end of treatment (cycle 6 or 8). The European Organiza-

the EORTC Quality of Life 23-item Breast Cancer–Specific
Module (EORTC QLQ-BR-23) were used.13,14 All items in the
EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BR-23 were linearly transformed
to functioning or symptom scales ranging from 0 to 100
according to the scoring manual.15
Protocol-specified exploratory end points included the
evaluation of BCRFS in biological subgroups defined by estro-
gen receptor status, HER2 status, and proliferation rate.
Statistical Analysis
The original statistical design of the study (September 2004)
aimed at detecting a 10% absolute increase in 5-year BCRFS,
from 70% to 80%, with the tailored dose-dense schedule
with 80% power, which would require approximately 150
events after 5 years, assuming proportional hazards.16 This
was translated to 450 patients per treatment group. In July
2008, the study was amended to have 80% power to detect
smaller differences in 5-year BCRFS (difference of 8%, from
71% to 79%), requiring 225 events. To reach this, a total of
1524 patients were needed, which was deemed feasible
because the German Breast Group joined the study. A pre-
planned blinded interim analysis by the study statistician in
cooperation with the independent data and safety monitor-
ing committee in August 2010 revealed that the observed
event rate was lower than assumed, and increasing the num-
ber of patients to 2000 was advised.
The median follow-up time was estimated using the
reversed Kaplan-Meier method.17 Time to event was esti-
mated and plotted using nonparametric cumulative inci-
dence functions, taking into account the competing risk of
deaths not due to breast cancer in the analysis of BCRFS and
DDFS. End point–specific survival corresponds to the
complement (1 − cumulative incidence function) of these
failure curves. Differences in survival times were tested
using the log-rank test stratified for site and hormone recep-
tor status. The significance level for BCRFS was set to .05.
Effect of allocated treatment on survival was estimated
using proportional hazards regression stratified for site and
hormone receptor status and is presented as hazard ratio
(HR) and 95% confidence interval. For subgroup analyses,
tests of interaction were performed by including a product
(treatment × factor) in the regression model. Forest plots
were used to summarize these results. All efficacy analyses
were performed in the intention-to-treat population. No
correction for multiple testing was done for the secondary
end points and the subgroup analyses; accordingly, these
should be considered exploratory.
Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least 1
dose of the study treatment. Grade 3 and 4 hematologic and
nonhematologic toxic effects were summarized using descrip-
tive statistics, separately for each chemotherapy regimen.
Patients’HRQoL at the end of study treatment was ana-
lyzed using linear regression models including baseline val-
ues,country,andtreatment.Resultsarepresentedasmeandif-
ference with 95% confidence interval. P values from these
analyses refer to Wald tests.
All P values are 2-sided. The statistical analyses were done
with Stata version 14 statistical software (StataCorp LP).

Results
Patients
Between February 20, 2007, and September 14, 2011, a total
of 2017 patients (1006 in the tailored dose-dense group and
1011 in the control group; median [interquartile range] age, 51
[45-58] years; 80% with hormone receptor–positive tumors;
97% with node-positive disease) were enrolled at 86 sites in
Sweden (n = 780), Germany (n = 772), and Austria (n = 465).
Of these, 11 patients withdrew consent shortly after random-
ization and 3 additional patients were lost to follow-up at
day 0; they were not included in the intention-to-treat popu-
lation (Figure 1). Baseline characteristics were well balanced
between the study groups (Table 1). A total of 2000 patients
(1001 in the tailored dose-dense group and 999 in the control
group) received at least 1 course of therapy.
Efficacy
The majority of patients in the tailored dose-dense group (832
of 1001 [83.1%]) and the control group (947 of 999 [94.8%])
received all planned courses of chemotherapy. The differ-
ence between the 2 groups is mainly due to the fact that 90
patients (9.0%) in the tailored dose-dense group did not re-
ceive the last planned course of docetaxel. The cumulative
doses for all study treatments were higher in the tailored dose-
dense group, especially for epirubicin and cyclophospha-
mide (eTable 4 in Supplement 1).
At the data collection cutoff date for this first planned
event-driven analysis (January 22, 2016), the median fol-
low-up time was 5.3 years (interquartile range, 4.5-6.1 years).
A total of 269 BCRFS events were reported, 118 in the tailored
dose-dense group and 151 in the control group (HR, 0.79; 95%
CI, 0.61-1.01; log-rank P = .06). Five-year BCRFS was 88.7% in
the tailored dose-dense group and 85.0% in the control group

(Figure 2A). The tailored dose-dense group had significantly
better EFS than the control group (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.63-
0.99; P = .04; 5-year EFS, 86.7% vs 82.1%; Figure 2B), but the
groupsdidnotdifferinOS(HR,0.77;95%CI,0.57-1.05;P = .09;

CI,0.64-1.08;P = .17;5-yearDDFS,89.4%vs86.7%;Figure2D).
All reported events and first events are detailed in eTable 5 in
Supplement 1 and the cumulative incidence of all first events
over time is illustrated in eFigure 1 in Supplement 1.
An exploratory subgroup analysis of BCRFS showed that
the results were consistent in all prespecified subgroups
(Figure 3), including patients with hormone receptor–
positive disease (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.54-1.00) and hormone
receptor–negative disease (HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.57-1.39) (Wald
test, P for interaction = .47). Country was not a predefined
factor, but it was included in the analysis (Figure 3). The
apparent differences in BCRFS among countries were not sig-
nificant (P for interaction = .06).
Safety
A total of 2000 patients (1001 in the tailored dose-dense
group and 999 in the control group) received at least 1 course
of therapy and were evaluated for safety. Nonhematologic
grade 3 or 4 toxic effects were seen in 527 patients (52.6%) in
the tailored dose-dense group and 366 (36.6%) in the control
group. The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were
fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, and neutropenic infection in
both groups (Table 2). Hematologic toxic effects were
increased in the tailored dose-dense group, as was expected
owing to dose tailoring, mainly for the tailored dose-dense
epirubicin and cyclophosphamide treatment. One toxic death
occurred in the control group, caused by reactivation of viral
hepatitis B.
During the follow-up, 37 secondary non–breast cancer ma-
lignant neoplasms were reported: 18 in the tailored dose-
dense group and 19 in the control group (eTable 6 in
Supplement 1). These included 5 cases of myelodysplastic syn-
drome or acute myeloid leukemia: 3 in the tailored dose-
dense group and 2 in the control group.
Health-Related Quality of Life
Health-related quality of life was evaluated in 1629 patients
who agreed to participate in these assessments. No statistical
differences were found at baseline for any of the HRQoL vari-
ables. Statistically significant differences were seen between
the treatment groups, favoring the control group on 13 of 15
variables on the EORTC QLQ-C30 at the end of treatment
(P < .01; eFigure 2 and eTable 7 in Supplement 1). For the

EORTC QLQ-BR-23, patients in the tailored dose-dense group
scored worse on the sexual functioning and chemotherapy
adverse effects subscales than the control group. Moderate
clinical differences (10-19 points) were found for the sub-
scales of global health status, role functioning, social func-
tioning, fatigue, pain, dyspnea, appetite loss, and chemo-
therapy adverse effects, all favoring the control group. In
addition, there were small clinical differences (5-9 points)
between the treatment groups for physical functioning, cog-
nitive functioning, insomnia, and diarrhea, with higher levels
of HRQoL in the control group.
Discussion
This international, multicenter, randomized phase 3 study
compared a tailored and dose-dense schedule vs a standard
3-weekly schedule of adjuvant chemotherapy in axillary
lymph node–positive or high-risk lymph node–negative early
breast cancer. There was no statistically significant improve-
ment in BCRFS with the tailored dose-dense schedule, and
the point estimate difference of 3.7% was less than the 8.0%
used in designing the study. In addition, nonhematologic
toxic effects were more frequent in the tailored dose-dense
group. The statistically significant relative benefit of 21.0% in
EFS, a secondary end point in this study, is in the same range
as in the meta-analysis of the first-generation trials (19%) and
in a more recent trial (23%) comparing dose-dense vs conven-
tional chemotherapy.4,18
Theinvestigationalschedulingofchemotherapyinthistrial
used both higher dose density and dose escalation to inten-
sify treatment, similar to a previous study by Moebus et al.19
Hypothetically, this schedule may increase efficacy both when
tumor growth follows Gompertzian kinetics requiring higher
density20 and when partially resistant clones are present, re-
quiring higher doses. Additionally, dose escalation was
achieved in a controlled fashion by tailoring chemotherapy
doses according to the observed toxic effects in each patient.

chemotherapy. Tailored dose-dense chemotherapy was 4 courses of tailored
dose-dense epirubicin and cyclophosphamide every 2 weeks followed by
4 courses of tailored dose-dense docetaxel every 2 weeks. Standard
chemotherapy (control group) was 3 courses of fluorouracil, epirubicin,

was similar, patients in the tailored dose-dense group under-
went more therapy courses and subsequently had more toxic
effects, more hospital visits, and frequent blood draws.
The observed 5-year BCRFS for the control group was
85.0%, much higher than the assumed 70% when the trial was
designed, despite the fact that 40% of the patients had 4 or
more positive axillary nodes. This may be due to the high in-
clusion of patients with hormone receptor–positive disease,
frequent use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor sup-
port, adjuvant trastuzumab for HER2-amplified tumors, and
optimized endocrine therapy compared with historical co-
horts.AssuggestedbytheEasternCooperativeOncologyGroup
1199 trial,21 an additional advantage may have been the use of
3-weeklydocetaxelinsteadofpaclitaxel,whichwasusedinthe
control group of previous studies of dose-dense therapy.3,18
There was no heterogeneity in the effect of therapy inten-
sification among prespecified subgroups, including hormone
receptor status and HER2 status of the primary tumor. An in-
dividual patient data meta-analysis would help to assess
whetherchemotherapydoseintensificationinearlybreastcan-
cer should be reserved for specific subgroups of patients.
The study has some limitations that should be acknowl-
edged. First, the null hypothesis could not be rejected for the
primary end point and most of the secondary end points.
Longer follow-up could show whether this indicates lack of
effect or lack of statistical power due to a better outcome
than expected for both groups. Second, although predefined,
the described secondary end point and subgroup analyses
were not adequately powered and must be considered
exploratory. Third, the combination of dose tailoring and
dose-dense scheduling does not allow any conclusions about
which of the 2 strategies for dose intensification (or both)
account for the observed outcomes.
Conclusions
Among women with high-risk early breast cancer, the use of
tailored dose-dense chemotherapy compared with standard
adjuvant chemotherapy did not result in a statistically signifi-
cant improvement in BCRFS. Nonhematologic toxic effects
were more frequent in the tailored dose-dense group.
