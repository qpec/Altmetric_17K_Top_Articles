Abstract
Volume reduction and shape abnormality of the hippocampus have been associated with mood 
disorders. However, the hippocampus is not a uniform structure and consists of several subfields, 
such as the cornu ammonis (CA) subfields CA1–4, the dentate gyrus (DG) including a granule cell 
layer (GCL) and a molecular layer (ML) that continuously crosses adjacent subiculum and CA 
fields. It is known that cellular and molecular mechanisms associated with mood disorders may be 
localized to specific hippocampal subfields. Thus, it is necessary to investigate the link between 
the in vivo hippocampal subfield volumes and specific mood disorders, such as bipolar disorder 
(BD) and major depressive disorder (MDD). In the present study, we used a state-of-the-art 
hippocampal segmentation approach, and we found that patients with BD had reduced volumes of 
hippocampal subfields, specifically in the left CA4, GCL, ML, and both sides of the hippocampal 
tail, compared to healthy subjects and patients with MDD. The volume reduction was especially 
severe in patients with bipolar I disorder (BD-I). We also demonstrated that hippocampal subfield 
volume reduction was associated with the progression of the illness. For patients with BD-I, the 
volumes of the right CA1, ML and Sub decreased as the illness duration increased, and the 
volumes of both sides of the CA2/3, CA4, and hippocampal tail had negative correlations with the 
number of manic episodes. These results indicated that among the mood disorders the

 hippocampal subfields were more affected in BD-I compared to BD-II and MDD, and manic 
episodes had focused progressive effect on the CA2/3 and CA4 and hippocampal tail.
Introduction
Bipolar disorder (BD) affects 2% of the world’s population, with subthreshold forms 
affecting another 2%.1 On the other hand, major depressive disorder (MDD) has a lifetime 
prevalence of 16.6%. Both disorders are leading causes of disability-adjusted life years 
worldwide according to The Global Burden of Disease study and the World Health 
Organization.2,3 In addition, they have been independently associated with missed 
workdays,4 comorbid cardiovascular5 and endocrine diseases,6 neurocognitive impairment, 
and suicide attempts.7 Therefore, understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms that 
underlie the development of both disorders is crucial for alleviating the impact of these 
devastating illnesses on public health.
The hippocampus is essential for the acquisition, consolidation and retrieval of memory.8 It 
is involved in verbal memory functions and other complex behaviors, including stress 
responses, emotions, sensorimotor integrations, and goal-directed activity, all of which may 
be disrupted in mood disorder.9,10 Noticeably, studies of hippocampal volumes in patients 
with BD have been contradictory so far, showing no changes11–13, smaller volumes14–16, 
and even larger volumes in BD patients as compared to healthy subjects17,18. These 
inconsistent results could be related to the use of certain medication with neuroprotective 
effect, such as lithium and the heterogeneity of BD types in these studies.19–22 A recent 
study, however, reported that patients with BD have reductions in hippocampus according to 
prior morbidity (number of manic episodes and hospitalization).23 Regarding MDD, a recent 
meta-analysis of 32 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have confirmed the 
difference in hippocampal volume between patients and controls, but only among patients 
with MDD whose duration of illness was longer than two years or who had more than one 
mood episode.24 These findings point to a progressive reduction of the hippocampus as a 
function of prior morbidity in mood disorders.
However, it is known that the hippocampus is not a uniform structure and consists of 
subfields with distinct morphology: the cornu ammonis (CA) subfields CA1–4, the dentate 
gyrus (DG), the fimbria, and the adjacent subiculum and presubiculum.9 It is also known 
that cellular and molecular mechanisms associated with mood disorders may be localized to 
specific hippocampal subfields.25–27 Therefore, it is necessary to investigate to which extent 
in vivo hippocampal subfield volumes differ between BD, MDD, and healthy subjects to 
better understand the role of the hippocampus in mood disorders.
Previous studies have made great advancement in understanding the morphometric and 
volumetric changes in the hippocampus in mood disorders using surface-based shape 
analyses14,28,29 or an automated method of labeling the subfields based on an in vivo 
atlas.30,31 However, the surface-based shape analysis could not reach deep structures of the 
hippocampus. The in vivo atlas was derived from MRI scans with limited contrast and the 
validity of the atlas was not confirmed with the actual tissues.32 The method used to segment 
the hippocampal subfields in the present study was developed based on ex vivo hippocampal

 tissues scanned with ultra-high field strength.33 The resolution and accuracy of the 
segmentation were proved to be higher than the previous method using in vivo atlas,33,34 
which will help us to observe the localized changes within hippocampus related to mood 
disorders and their progression.
Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate diagnostic differences in 
hippocampal subfield volumes in a large sample of patients with MDD, patients with BD, 
and healthy subjects. We hypothesized that patients would have smaller hippocampal 
subfield volumes than healthy control subjects and that patients with BD would have smaller 
volumes than patients with MDD. Moreover, we conducted post hoc analyzes of associations 
between selected subfields and illness duration and number of mood episodes. We 
hypothesized smaller volumes to correlate with increased illness duration and a higher 
number of prior mood episodes.
Materials and Methods
Participants
Subjects were recruited through flyers, radio, and newspaper advertisements from the 
community and outpatient psychiatric clinics from 2002 to 2006. Patient inclusion criteria 
were subjects with bipolar I disorder (BD-I), bipolar II disorder (BD-II) or major depressive 
disorder (MDD) according to DSM-IV. Exclusion criteria included head trauma with 
residual effects, neurological disorders, and uncontrolled major medical conditions based on 
self reports. We used a medication history form to obtain history about prior medication use 
from all patients based on their self-reports (Supplementary Materials). We also obtained a 
urine drug test to detect any current drug abuse, whenever applicable. Healthy controls (HC) 
were excluded if they had a history of any Axis I disorder, had a first-degree relative with 
any Axis I disorder, or used psychoactive medication less than two weeks before the study. 
The schedule of patients and HC being recruited and scanned were mixed, so that the date of 
the scanning was not related to the diagnostic groups. Subjects were evaluated through a 
socio-demographic history form for age, gender, years of education, as well as occupational 
status. Axis-I diagnoses and clinical characteristics were assessed with the Structured 
Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID), administered by research assistants or postdoctoral 
fellows supervised by an experienced research psychiatrist. Inter-rater reliability was 
checked periodically by having raters do interviews together. Current mood symptoms were 
assessed with the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D)35 and the Young Mania Rating 
Scale (YMRS).36 A power analysis indicated that for three-group (HC, BD and MDD) F 
tests, to achieve an effect size f of 0.25 with type I error at 0.05 and power at 0.95, the ideal 
sample size should be at least 252 in total. No hardware upgrade of the scanner was 
performed during the study. The study protocol was approved by the local Institutional 
Review Board and informed consent was obtained from all the participants.
MRI data acquisition and preprocessing
The structural T1-weighted scan of each subject was acquired on a Philips 1.5 Tesla MRI 
scanner (Philips Medical System, Andover, MA, USA) with a three-dimensional axial fast 
field echo sequence with the following parameters: repetition time (TR) = 24 ms, echo time

 (TE) = 5 ms, flip angle = 40°, field of view (FOV) = 256 mm, slice thickness = 1 mm, 
matrix size = 256–256 and 150 slices. All scans were visually inspected to rule out gross 
artifacts.
Subcortical reconstruction and segmentation were first performed with the FreeSurfer 
software suite version 5.3.0 (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu). The procedure including 
motion correction, intensity normalization, automated topology corrections and automatic 
segmentations of cortical and subcortical regions is documented elsewhere.37–39
A novel automated algorithm from FreeSurfer that will be released in the next version was 
used to segment the hippocampal subfields. The subfield atlas was derived from high 
resolution (0.13 mm) ex vivo MRI data of postmortem medial temporal tissue from a 7-T 
scanner (Figure 1).33 This algorithm was proved to be more accurate than the previous 
method32 and was able to reliably identify granule cell layer (GCL) within the dentate gyrus 
(DG), and the molecular layer (ML) within the subiculum and the CA fields. The algorithm 
could also provide a better estimation of CA volumes.34 In the current study, we included 
eight hippocampal subfields: CA1, CA2 and CA3 (noted as CA3 due to the 
indistinguishable MR contrast between CA2 and CA3), CA4, GCL, ML, presubiculum 
(Presub), subiculum (Sub) and the hippocampal tail (Tail; the posterior end of the 
hippocampus).
We used a two-step quality control protocol, similar to the ENIGMA protocol (http://
enigma.ini.usc.edu/).22,40,41 To be brief, any outlier (five standard deviations) of any 
hippocampal subfield was excluded. Then each segmented image, overlaid on the 
corresponding brain structural image, was visually inspected by two co-authors 
independently (BC and HT), in order to exclude segmentations with poor registration to the 
hippocampus location or with apparent wrong assignment of the subfields. We did not 
exclude any image because we did not find any outlier or bad segmentation of hippocampal 
subfields with the novel algorithm.
Statistical Analyses
Analysis on the effect of diagnosis—Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS 
(Version 23.0; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). For each hippocampal subfield, we used a general 
linear model (GLM) to investigate the effect of mood disorder diagnosis. Diagnosis group 
(HC, BD, and MDD) was entered as an independent variable, while the whole hippocampal 
volume and the hippocampal subfield volumes were entered as a dependent variable. We 
used age, gender, and the intracranial volume (ICV) as covariates. Because we observed no 
effect of ethnicity in the preliminary analysis, we did not include it as a covariate. 
Bonferroni correction was performed across the 16 regions. Post-hoc t-tests on the estimated 
subfield volumes adjusted for the covariates were performed between the three diagnosis 
groups to identify the pairwise group differences. The p values of the three pairwise 
comparisons between the diagnosis groups were corrected with Bonferroni correction. 
Further Post-hoc analysis was performed to identify which subtype of BD was driving the 
effect from BD. We considered p-values < 0.05 significant.

 Analysis on the effect of illness progression—The illness progression was 
considered to be represented by two typical measurements: the illness duration and the 
number of mood episodes. Based on several studies on the neuroprogression of bipolar 
disorder and major depressive disorder, the number of episodes was consistent with several 
aspects of the disorder, such as the brain atrophy and the general functioning.23,42–46 The 
partial correlations were performed between the hippocampal subfield volumes and the 
illness duration, as well as the numbers of manic, hypomanic, mixed and depressive 
episodes for BD-I, BD-II, and MDD controlling for age, gender, and ICV. Because a 
significant portion of patients reported more than 30 mood episodes, we considered the 
numbers of episodes as ordinal variables instead of scale variables in the correlation 
analysis. We considered p-values < 0.05 significant.
Results
Demographics
A total of 371 subjects were recruited (152 HC, 133 BD, and 86 MDD). Age (p=0.005), 
education (p<0.001), HAMD (p<0.001), and YMRS (p<0.001) were significantly different 
between the groups (Table S1). Patients with BD had significantly higher HAMD (p=0.043) 
and YMRS (p<0.001) than patients with MDD.
Findings between patients with mood disorders and healthy controls
We found significant diagnosis group effect in left (F2,365=6.551; p=0.002) and right 
(F2,365=4.569; p=0.011) whole hippocampal volumes. Post-hoc t-tests found that the group 
effect was primarily due to lower hippocampal volumes of patients with BD compared to 
HC and MDD, while hippocampal volumes in HC and MDD were not significantly different 
from each other.
We found significant diagnosis group effect in left CA1 (F2,365=3.369; p=0.035), CA3 
(F2,365=3.517; p=0.031), CA4 (F2,365=6.626; p=0.001), GCL (F2,365=6.930; p=0.001), 
Presub (F2,365=3.192; p=0.042), and both sides of ML (left: F2,365=6.196; p=0.002; right: 
F2,365=3.786; p=0.024) and Tail (left: F2,365=7.209; p=0.001; right: F2,365=6.271; p=0.002). 
Post-hoc t-tests found that the group effect was primarily due to lower hippocampal subfield 
volumes of patients with BD compared to HC and MDD (Table 1). Only the results in left 
CA4, GCL, ML and both sides of Tail would survive the Bonferroni correction for the 
multiple comparisons across the sixteen subfields.
Findings between bipolar disorder subtypes and healthy controls
With further post-hoc t-tests within the BD subtypes, we found that the lower hippocampal 
subfield volumes of BD were majorly driven by patients with bipolar I disorder (BD-I), 
although patients with bipolar II disorder (BD-II) showed non-significant decrease of the 
hippocampal subfield volumes (Table S1). The hippocampal subfield volumes in HC, BD-I, 
BD-II, and MDD are shown in Figure 2 (Figure S1).

 Hippocampal subfield volume changes associated with progression of mood disorders
We investigated hippocampal subfield volume changes associated with progression of mood 
disorders. The progression of mood disorders was represented by the illness duration and the 
number of mood episodes. With partial Pearson correlation that controlled for age, gender, 
and ICV, we found that right CA1 (r=−0.270; p=0.025), ML (r=−0.265; p=0.028), and Sub 
(r=−0.213; p=0.040) were negatively correlated with the illness duration of patients with 
BD-I (Figure S2). No correlations of illness duration and any of the subfield volumes were 
found in patients with BD-II and MDD.
We found significant negative correlations in patient with BD-I between the number of 
manic episodes and both sides of CA3 (left, r=−0.256, p=0.016; right, r=−0.284, p=0.007), 
CA4 (left, r=−0.240; p=0.024; right, r=−0.250, p=0.019) and hippocampal tail (left, r=
−0.237, p=0.026; right, r=−0.233, p=0.029) (Figure S3), and non-significant trend GCL (left, 
r=−0.192, p=0.073; right, r=−0.195, p=0.069). No significant correlation between the 
number of hypomanic, mixed and depressive and hippocampal subfield volumes was found 
in patients with BD-I. Besides a positive correlation between the left hippocampal tail 
volume and the number of hypomanic episodes in BD-II patients (r=0.386, p=0.043), no 
correlation between the number of any mood episodes and hippocampal subfield volumes 
was found in patients with BD-II or MDD (Table S2).
Discussion
In the present study, with a state-of-the-art hippocampal segmentation approach, we showed 
that patients with BD had reduced volumes of hippocampal subfields, specifically in the left 
CA4, GCL, ML, and both sides of the hippocampal tail, compared to healthy subjects and 
patients with MDD. The volume reduction was relatively more severe in patients with BD-I 
than BD-II, which spread across all the subfields of the hippocampus. We also demonstrated 
that hippocampal subfield volume reduction was associated with the progression of the 
illness. Specifically, in patients with BD-I, the volumes of the right CA1, ML, and Sub 
decreased as the illness duration increased, and the volumes of both sides of the CA2/3, 
CA4, and hippocampal tail were negatively correlated with the number of manic episodes. 
These results indicated that among the mood disorders the hippocampal subfields were more 
affected in BD-I compared to BD-II and MDD, and manic episodes had focused progressive 
effect on the CA2/3 and CA4, as well as the tail of the hippocampus.
Our findings that the CA4 and GCL showed reduced volumes were consistent with the 
previous studies using the in vivo atlas, in which the two subfields were not differentiable.31 
Cells in GCL are important to functional neurogenesis during brain development and 
adulthood.47 The reduced neurogenesis is linked with stress and mood disorders and can be 
recovered by certain interventions, such as antidepressant treatments.48 The reduced GCL 
volume in BD observed in our study was in line with this theory. The CA4 is the hilar region 
and is a polymorphic layer that contains different types of interneurons within the DG. CA4 
cannot be presented with surface-based shape reconstruction. Postmortem studies showed 
that mRNAs of the complexins I and II that are important to synaptic transmission49 were 
lower in CA4 of patients with BD,26,27 a similar finding to that in schizophrenia.26 The 
mRNA associated with the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was also lower in CA4

 of patients with BD,27,50 which is important for the survival and growth of neurons and 
synapses.51,52 Moreover, the reelin, a protein involved in cell migration and cortical 
lamination53, and reelin-positive cell counts were also lower in CA4 of patients with 
BD.27,54 The reelin protein levels might decrease progressively, which is in line with our 
finding that CA4 volume was negatively correlated with the number of manic episodes in 
BD. The CA4 labeled with the new method also includes the molecular layer of DG, which 
receives the major excitatory input from the cortex and is the first synaptic connection of the 
trisynaptic circuit of the hippocampus. Thus, the reduction of CA4 in our study may also 
indicate synaptic atrophy between the cortex and hippocampus. These findings indicate that 
BD may involve pathology of synapses and neurogenesis, which causes systematic 
cytoarchitectural abnormality in neurons, dendrites or axons that are linked with the 
morphometric alterations detected by brain imaging.55
The volume reduction of ML in BD was a novel finding, because ML was not labeled using 
the previous method based on in vivo atlas31,33 and was only partially observable by the 
surface-based method. The ML labeled in the new method is the molecular layer in 
subiculum and CA fields, consisting interneurons synaptic connections of these subfields.56 
The interneurons play an important role of regulating the activities within the 
hippocampus.57 Considering that the ML was involved in illness progression together with 
CA fields in BD-I, the reduced ML volume in BD may further indicate pathology of 
synapses between the pyramidal cells and interneurons in BD.
The reduced volume in the subfield of the hippocampal tail was strongly associated with 
BD, especially BD-I. The hippocampal tail volume was also negatively correlated with the 
illness duration and the number of manic episodes, indicating a progressive atrophy. These 
findings were not observed with the previous method with in vivo atlas,31 because the atlas 
did not work well at the hippocampal head or tail.33 However, these findings were consistent 
with previous studies using surface-based method.29
It is worth mentioning that our study was able to consider for two important variables in the 
study of hippocampus changes in patients with BD, such as the lithium effect on the 
hippocampus (Supplementary Materials) and the effect of BD types. Indeed, several 
important studies, including meta-analyses reported the neuroprotective effect of lithium in 
the hippocampus.19,58,59 Regarding BD type effect on the hippocampus, our previous work 
showed that manic episodes are important clinical correlates of hippocampus reductions.23 
In addition, a recent study from the ENIGMA Bipolar Disorder Working Group with more 
than 4000 participants showed that patients with BD-I have decreased hippocampus volume 
compared to healthy controls while patients with BD-II showed no difference in the 
hippocampus volume compared to healthy controls.22 We think that these two moderators 
may explain why some previous studies found that patients with MDD may have decreased 
hippocampus compared to patients with BD.20,21 Both studies did not control for BD type, 
while Kempton and colleagues were not able to control for the lithium effect. On the other 
hand, Wise and colleagues performed a meta-regression analysis with lithium use as a 
moderator, and found that lithium use was not able to explain the between-study 
heterogeneity.21 This finding may indirectly suggest that lithium is not associated with 
hippocampus volume, which may need further investigation, given the large body of

 literature that points to a neuroprotective and neurotrophic effect of lithium in patients with 
BD. Therefore, future replication studies and meta-analyses may further discuss the effect of 
lithium use and BD type on the hippocampus subfields of patients with mood disorder.
Our findings point to a crucial role of manic episodes, but not the depressive ones, in the 
degeneration of hippocampus subfields. This is in line with recent studies, which suggested 
that the number of manic episodes seems to be the clinical marker more robustly associated 
with brain changes and neuroprogression in BD.46,55,60 Moreover, our previous work that 
included only patients with BD-I also reported that reductions in the total hippocampus 
volume were associated with manic episodes.23 Of note, the impact of the manic episode on 
brain changes is not only associated with hippocampus. For instance, a 6-year follow-up 
study in patients with BD-I showed decreased frontal cortical volume (dorsolateral 
prefrontal and inferior frontal cortex) as a function of previous manic episodes.61 Finally, 
another interesting finding from our work is that changes in hippocampus subfields were 
found in patients with BD but not in those ones with MDD. Noticeably, the effect size in 
patients with BD was largely drove by those ones with BD-I. In line with this finding, some 
studies, including the work of Hibar and colleagues,22 showed a BD type effect in reductions 
of hippocampus and other areas, such as frontal lobe.62 In conclusion, it seems that the 
pathophysiological underpinnings of BD-I are more consistent compared to patients with 
BD-II or MDD regarding neuroanatomical changes.
Our findings also have therapeutic and diagnostic implications for future studies in patients 
with mood disorders. The reductions of hippocampus subfields presented here might be used 
as therapeutic targets or biomarkers of treatment response. In this sense, it was reported that 
lithium has neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects on the hippocampus of patients with 
bipolar disorder.19,58 A recent cross-sectional study, which included only patients with BD-I, 
showed that long-term, but not short-term, exposure to lithium treatment was associated with 
larger total hippocampal volumes and bilateral CA2–3, left CA4-DG, left presubiculum, and 
right subiculum volumes.63 In addition, it was showed that erythropoietin was associated 
with memory improvement and reversal of brain matter loss in the left hippocampal CA1–3 
and subiculum in patients with mood disorders.64 Regarding diagnostic implications, future 
studies should consider the hippocampus subfield changes presented in the current study as 
well as other relevant brain regions that are altered in mood disorders to build a 
neuroanatomical network signature using machine learning techniques, so that we are able to 
differentiate patients with mood disorders in regards to the diagnosis and stage of the 
disorder.65,66
The present study has a cross-sectional design and causality cannot be established between 
hippocampus subfields reduction and diagnoses, mood episodes or illness duration. In 
addition, recall bias and the influence of current symptoms may have interfered with our 
findings. Specifically, our reliance on retrospective self-report for the number of mood 
episodes may be influence of biases such as the fact that patients with greater severity of 
illness may have been more likely to identify previous mood episodes. Moreover, we were 
not able to control for some confounders, such as medication status due to the heterogeneous 
medication types and histories among the patient groups (see Supplementary Materials for 
further analyses). Although some medications, such as lithium, might prevent the volume

 reduction of the hippocampus in BD,67 no patient with MDD and only eight patients with 
BD were taking lithium. We did not find any correlation between the illness duration and the 
hippocampal subfield volumes in MDD compared to previous studies on the whole 
hippocampal volume.24 However, in several studies that investigated the relationship 
between the illness duration and whole hippocampal volume and included patients similar 
with our study with respect to the illness duration, number of depressive episodes and 
hospitalization (Supplementary Materials), one found negative correlation only in the left 
hippocampus,68 one found the correlation was significant only when calculated non-
linearly,69 one did not find any correlation,70 and two used a different measurements, treated 
and untreated depressed days, which could be more sensitive but were only a subset period 
compared to illness duration.71,72 Thus, further studies will be necessary to investigate these 
inconsistencies in MDD and the corresponding results need to be in interpreted with caution.
In summary, the present study provides evidence of hippocampus subfield volume 
reductions in patients with BD, mainly in those ones with BD-I. Moreover, it adds to the 
notion of neuroprogression, since changes in specific regions of hippocampus were 
associated with number of manic episodes and illness duration. Longitudinal studies will 
help to clarify the causal relationship between manic episodes and volumetric changes in 
hippocampus subfields, and further cellular and molecular studies integrating structural 
imaging will help to understand the biological mechanisms underlying this relationship.
