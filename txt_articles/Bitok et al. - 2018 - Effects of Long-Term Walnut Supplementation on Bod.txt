Abstract: Objective: To assess the effects of chronic walnut consumption on body weight and adiposity
in elderly individuals. Methods: The Walnuts and Healthy Aging study is a dual-center (Barcelona,
Spain and Loma Linda University (LLU)), 2-year randomized parallel trial. This report concerns
only the LLU cohort. Healthy elders (mean age 69 year, 67% women) were randomly assigned
to walnut (n = 183) or control diets (n = 173). Subjects in the walnut group received packaged
walnuts (28–56 g/day), equivalent to ≈15% of daily energy requirements, to incorporate into their
habitual diet, while those in the control group abstained from walnuts. Adiposity was measured
periodically, and data were adjusted for in-trial changes in self-reported physical activity. Results:
After 2 years, body weight significantly decreased (p = 0.031), while body fat significantly increased
(p = 0.0001). However, no significant differences were observed between the control and walnut
groups regarding body weight (−0.6 kg and −0.4 kg, respectively, p = 0.67) or body fat (+0.9% and
+1.3%, respectively, p = 0.53). Lean body mass, waist circumference, and waist-to-hip ratio remained
essentially unchanged. Sensitivity analyses were consistent with the findings of primary analysis.
Conclusion: Our findings indicate that walnuts can be incorporated into the daily diet of healthy
elders without concern for adverse effects on body weight or body composition.

1. Introduction
Obesity in older adults continues to be a major public health challenge in the United States
(U.S.) and around the world [1,2]. More than a third of U.S. adults aged 60 years and over are
considered as being obese [1,2], a trend that will continue to rise in parallel with the pace of population
aging [3]. Excess body fat is an important risk factor for morbidity and mortality from heart disease,
diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and metabolic syndrome [4]. In older adults, obesity imposes further
functional limitations on top of declining physical function and adversely affects quality of life [5].

Over the years, mounting scientific evidence has shown that consuming nuts in moderate amounts
is associated with reduced risk of coronary heart disease [6]. Nuts have a high total fat content (mostly
as mono- and polyunsaturated fat), ranging from 46% in cashews and pistachios to 76% in macadamia
nuts, and provide 20–30 kJ per gram [7]. They are also rich in protein, fiber, vitamins, minerals,
phytosterols, and polyphenols [8]. Following the approval of a qualified health claim by the Food and
Drug Association (FDA) supporting the inclusion of 1.5 ounces (42 g) walnuts in the daily diet [9],
several agencies including the American Heart Association (AHA) and the Academy of Nutrition
and Dietetics (AND) recommend the inclusion of nuts in the daily diet to further heart health [10,11].
Notwithstanding the recommendations, there is a common perception that consuming nuts on a regular
basis may lead to unwanted increase in body weight and a higher risk of developing overweight
or obesity. However, a meta-analysis of 33 clinical trials assessing the effects of nut-enriched diets
compared with various control diets on changes in body weight, body mass index (BMI), and waist
circumference indicates that nut-enriched diets do not increase adiposity [12]. In fact, including nuts as
part of a weight loss regimen can lead to greater weight loss than simply following a low-fat diet [13].
It is worth noting that many of the trials included in the meta-analysis were conducted over a relatively
short period of time (≤6 m) and with mostly young and middle-age adults. Thus, whether long-term
inclusion of nuts in the daily, self-selected, unrestricted-calorie diets of elderly subjects results in
weight gain remains unclear.
We had a unique opportunity to clarify this issue within the framework of a 2-year trial testing the
effects of walnuts on age-related cognitive decline and macular degeneration in healthy elderly subjects.
We were primarily interested in determining if daily consumption of walnuts for an extended period
of time induced weight gain in free-living elderly subjects when compared to a similar concurrent
group of individuals with low nut consumption.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Study Design and Population
Details of the Walnuts and Healthy Aging (WAHA) study have been published [14]. In brief, it was
a randomized dual-center trial, conducted at Loma Linda University (California) and Hospital Clínic
(Barcelona, Spain). This opportunistic sub-study concerns data from participants recruited at the Loma
Linda site between October 2012 and May 2014. Recruitment for the WAHA study was multi-pronged,
and included direct mailings, brochures, flyers, web, and newspaper advertisements. Candidates were
pre-screened and excluded from participation if they had morbid obesity, uncontrolled diabetes or
hypertension, impaired cognitive function, or bilateral eye conditions preventing visualization of
the retina. The present study was conducted according to guidelines laid down in the Declaration
of Helsinki. The Institutional Review Board at Loma Linda University approved the study protocol.
Written informed consent was obtained from each participant prior to enrollment into the study.
2.2. Intervention
With a parallel design, candidates who met eligibility criteria were randomly assigned to either
a walnut (experimental) or control group using a web-based, computerized random number table
with stratification by sex and age. Couples entering the study were treated as one number and
were randomized into the same group to facilitate compliance. We then utilized the World Health
Organization (WHO) formula for energy needs for adults >60 years [15] to estimate individual energy
requirements, following which participants received 28, 42, or 56 g (1, 1.5, or 2.0 oz.) of packaged
walnuts per day providing ≈15% of their estimated daily energy needs. No advice on food replacement
was given and no recipes were provided. Participants in the control group simply continued their
habitual diet with no supplementation and with instructions to refrain from eating walnuts or excessive
intake of other nuts (>2 servings/week). Simply being in a research study can cause individuals to
alter their lifestyle or behavior due to the awareness that they are being watched. This observation
 Nutrients 2018, 10, 1317

is particularly common among studies that collect body measurements. Consequently, we asked
participants not to alter their usual lifestyle habits, including physical activity level, while in the study.
Participants were largely unaware that adiposity measurements were outcomes of interest in the study.
2.3. Assessment of Diet
We collected 1490 unannounced 24-h telephone diet recalls from study participants during the
2-year period (752 in walnut group and 738 in control group). The diet recalls were obtained at regular
intervals to capture variability and seasonality in food intake. Dietary intake data were collected by
trained research dietitians and nutrient data obtained using the Nutrition Data System for Research
(NDSR) software version 2013 developed by the Nutrition Coordinating Center (NCC), University of
Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN [16]. Portion sizes were estimated using common household items; for
example, a fist for one baked potato, a deck of cards for a 3-oz serving of meat, or two handfuls for 1-oz
of chips or pretzels, as previously described [17]. The dietary recalls were used to determine if subjects
in the walnut group consumed their allotted amounts of walnuts and if their counterparts in the control
group refrained from deliberate consumption of walnuts. For the walnut group, consumption of
walnuts 6–7 days/week (85–100%) was considered excellent compliance and 4–5 days/week (57–71%),
as good compliance. Those who consumed walnuts ≤3 days/week were classified as non-compliant.
In the control group, participants were considered fully compliant if they refrained from eating walnuts
in any of the recalls, or if they consumed no more than 15 g of walnuts on any given day. We also used
the red blood cell (RBC) proportion of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), a nutrient enriched in walnuts, as
an objective biomarker [18] to assess adherence to the intervention.
2.4. Anthropometry, Body Composition, and Physical Activity
We measured participants’ body weight to the nearest 0.1 kg at baseline and bimonthly. Body fat
and lean body mass were measured at baseline, 1-year, and end of study. Body measurements
were obtained without shoes or heavy clothing using Tanita® TBF 300A Bioelectrical Impedance
Analysis scale (Tanita Corporation of America, Arlington Heights, IL, USA). Participants were asked
to avoid exercise or heavy hydration prior to visiting the clinic for body measurements. Height was
measured to the nearest 0.1 cm using a wall-mounted stadiometer (Holtain Ltd., Crymych, Dyfed,
UK). Waist circumference was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm an inch (2.54 cm) above the umbilicus
using a tape measure. Hip circumference was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm at the outermost
part of the greater trochanters. The waist-to-hip ratio (WtHR) was computed as the ratio of these
circumferences. All measurements were obtained following the Centers for Disease Control (CDC)
guidelines for the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) anthropometric
measurements [19]. We also asked participants to fill in a validated short version of the Minnesota
physical activity questionnaire for adult populations [19] at baseline, 1-year, and end of the study.
We then applied CDC and American College of Sports Medicine guidelines [20] to compute metabolic
equivalent (MET)-hours per week and to categorize general physical activities according to level of
intensity (low/sedentary, moderate, and vigorous).
2.5. Biomarker Analyses
Detailed procedures for blood collection and analyses in the WAHA study are published [14].
Fasting blood samples were obtained from all participants at baseline and end of the study. To reduce
assay variability, all samples were stored and run together in the same laboratory at the end of
the study.
The RBC proportion of ALA was assessed as described [21] in a random subset of
participants (n = 105, 51 in the control group and 54 in the walnut group). In brief, cells contained
in a 100-µL aliquot of EDTA-collected blood were hemolyzed and spun. The pellet (>99% RBC
membranes) was dried, dissolved in 1 mL BF3 methanol solution and heated to hydrolyze and
methylate glycerophospholipid fatty acids. The fatty acid methyl esters were isolated by adding
n-hexane and were separated by gas chromatography using an Agilent HP 7890 Gas Chromatograph

equipped with a 30 m × 0.25 µm × 0.25 mm SupraWAX-280 capillary column (Teknokroma, Barcelona,
Spain), an autosampler, and a flame ionization detector. The amount of ALA was expressed as a
percentage of total identified fatty acids in the RBC sample.
2.6. Statistical Analyses
Per protocol analysis was utilized to estimate changes in body measurements.
To reduce
intra-individual variation, measurements taken in duplicate were averaged and analyses performed
on the average. Descriptive statistics are reported as proportions (%) or means ± standard deviations.
When appropriate, the ANOVA or chi-square tests were used to assess whether the completers were
comparable to non-completers in terms of age, sex, ethnicity, and baseline BMI. Baseline imbalances
in demographic, anthropometric, and lifestyle variables between treatment groups were assessed
by Chi-square test for independence, two-sample t-test, and Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate.
The independent samples t-test was used to test between group difference in energy and nutrient
intake. Changes in body weight and adiposity measures were estimated using linear mixed models
with random intercepts and random slopes. Analyses were performed adjusting for in-trial changes
in physical activity. The main outcome was change in body weight from baseline to 2 years, with
five repeated measurements obtained in between. We also examined changes in body fat, waist
circumference, lean body mass, and WtHR at 1-year and end of the study. The predictors for the model
were time (as a continuous variable) and intervention (walnut or control group). In the models we
included interaction terms for time and intervention (group) by time effects. Three-way interactions
between time, intervention, and either age (≤70 years vs. ≥71 years), sex, or ethnicity (white vs.
non-white) were also assessed. Changes in ALA as proportion of total identified fatty acids were
determined by use of ANOVA, and the relationship between changes in self-reported walnut intake
and changes in RBC ALA assessed using Pearson correlation. Assuming a standard deviation of 4 kg,
the sample size of 356 participants provided >95% power (with p = 0.05) to detect a mean difference of
1 kg between groups. All analyses were performed using Statistical Analysis System (SAS Version 9.4).
3. Results
3.1. Participants
Baseline characteristics of 356 subjects who began the study are detailed in Table 1. Overall, the walnut
supplement was well accepted and well tolerated by study participants. Forty-nine participants (24 in
the walnut group and 25 in the control group) dropped out due to health-related concerns, intolerance
to walnuts, loss to follow-up, or undisclosed personal reasons. One death due to esophageal cancer
early in the study (unrelated to treatment) occurred in the walnut group. The dropouts did not
differ significantly from completers regarding age, sex, ethnicity, or baseline BMI (data not shown).
Nine incident cases of constipation and eight of diarrhea were reported in the walnut group during
the 2-year study period. Figure 1 is the study flowchart. Data presented are for participants who
completed the study (159 from the walnut group and 148 from the control group).

3.2. Compliance with Treatment
Only 1% of dietary recalls from the control group showed intake of trivial amounts of walnuts
(<15 g), mostly as an ingredient in recipes and commercially prepared foods such as walnut bread,
cookies, or salads. We therefore considered the subjects in the control group to have been 100%
compliant with instructions not to consume walnuts. Similarly, 99% of dietary recalls in the walnut
group reported consumption of the prescribed amount of walnuts (between 28 and 56 g/day, average
43 g/day). Table 2 shows data of macronutrients based on self-reported intake at two years. On average,
energy, total polyunsaturated fatty acids, protein and fiber intake was significantly higher in the walnut
group compared to control. The walnut supplement contributed approximately 15% of estimated daily
energy needs.

Analysis of baseline RBC fatty acids in a random sub-set of 105 study participants showed similar
baseline levels of ALA (mean, 0.30% for the walnut group and 0.28% for the control group; p = 0.830).
By the end of the study, the mean RBC ALA had increased by 33% in the walnut group and by 14% in
the control group (p < 0.001). The correlation between 2-year changes in self-reported walnut intake
and changes in RBC ALA was significant (r = 0.49, p < 0.001).
3.3. Changes in Physical Activity and Anthropometric Measurements
Table 3 shows the results of anthropometric measurements. Overall, body weight decreased
significantly over time in all study participants (p = 0.031). Figure 2 is a plot of the average body weight
of participants obtained periodically during clinic visits. Participants in the walnut group lost an
average of 0.4 kg compared to 0.6 kg in the control group, with no between group differences (p = 0.671).

We considered potential differences in adiposity changes based on age at baseline, sex, and 
ethnicity. However, the inclusion of these variables into the models did not significantly affect 
adiposity measures. 
4. Discussion 
This opportunistic study within a randomized controlled trial sought to investigate adiposity 
changes after walnut supplementation for 2 years in an independently living, predominantly 
healthy, elderly cohort. The increase in RBC ALA content in the walnut group is a reliable indicator 
that participants adhered to the intervention. We previously reported a decrease in RBC ALA in the 
control group at one year [22], which we speculated was the result of restricting the use of ALA-rich 
flax. It is possible that some control group participants may have reverted to consuming these 
products in the second year of the study, perhaps due to perceived benefits, hence the increase in 
RBC ALA.  
Overall, our data indicate that ingesting an average of nearly 300 kcal from walnuts daily for 2 
years (without advice on foods to be replaced when adding walnuts to the diet) does not promote 
weight gain or cause significant changes in body composition. Sensitivity analyses showed that 
weight and adiposity trends were proportionally similar for men and women.  
A tendency towards loss of lean body mass and fat gain over time has previously been reported 
in studies that have longitudinally assessed spontaneous adiposity changes in healthy, weight-stable 
elders [23,24]. One such study on free-living elderly persons of comparable mean age followed for 
the same period of time as our study participants reported a 0.32 kg and 0.16 kg loss in lean body

A tendency towards loss of lean body mass and fat gain over time has previously been reported
in studies that have longitudinally assessed spontaneous adiposity changes in healthy, weight-stable
elders [23,24]. One such study on free-living elderly persons of comparable mean age followed for
the same period of time as our study participants reported a 0.32 kg and 0.16 kg loss in lean body
mass and a concurrent 0.4% and 0.5% increase in body fat in men and women, respectively [25].
The self-reported increase in physical activity might have been due to participants’ awareness that they
were being monitored and the general tendency to over-report physical activity. Superior methods
of assessing physical activity such as the use of accelerometers can help validate physical activity in
future long-term nut trials in free-living individuals.

Notwithstanding the high energy density of walnuts, the lack of body weight increase might
be explained by several mechanisms.
We have previously reported that the energy contained
in walnuts was offset in part by ≈19% spontaneous reduction in caloric intake from other food
sources [22], although the compensatory response of our study subjects was lower than previously
reported [26,27]. Other possible mechanisms include increased satiety following nut intake [28],
energy regulation by nuts [29,30], and inefficient energy absorption from nuts [31] leading to
increased fecal fat excretion [30,32–34]. Concerning increased fecal fat, it has been demonstrated
that as much as 10–20% of the total energy from nuts is lost due to limited bioavailability in the
gut [35]. In confirmation, recent findings show that the metabolizable energy content of walnuts
is approximately 5.22 kcal/g (146 kcal/serving) as compared to the Atwater-calculated amount of
6.61 kcal/g (185 kcal/serving). Thus, Atwater factors overestimate by 21% the metabolizable energy
content of walnuts [36]. Food compensation, increased satiety and reduced available energy are the
most likely factors accounting for a stable weight during chronic nut consumption.
Our study has limitations. The original study was designed to assess changes in cognitive function
and retinal health [14] and our results derive from a post hoc analysis. Also, three different clinical
investigators obtained body measurements, suggesting that the data collected may be subject to
interobserver variability despite the use of standardized protocols. Our study also has strengths. To the
best of our knowledge, this study is the longest and largest randomized controlled trial to examine
body weight change in relation to nut consumption in free-living healthy elders. Our parallel design is
best suited for assessing weight changes since it disallows the potential for carry-over effects commonly
seen in crossover feeding studies. Also, compliance with walnut consumption was corroborated with
objective biomarkers. Future studies should consider examining whether walnuts contribute to energy
regulation by increasing resting energy expenditure. Objective assessment of physical activity, i.e.,
using accelerometers, should assist in determining precisely the extent to which physical activity
influences changes in body weight and adiposity measures in the context of chronic nut consumption.
5. Conclusions
In conclusion, our findings indicate that walnuts can be incorporated into the daily diet of healthy
elders without concern for adverse effects on body weight or body composition. Even so, we recognize
that individual differences in energy utilization and nutrient absorption and metabolism do exist,
a reason why results may vary from person to person.
