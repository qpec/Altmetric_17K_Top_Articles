Household and Neighborhood Contexts  
of Intimate Partner Violence
SynopSiS
objectives. Two sources of contextual risk on the prevalence and severity of 
intimate partner violence (IPV) are investigated: household economic condition 
and neighborhood disadvantage. There is debate about whether each context 
is an independent source of IPV risk and whether risks cumulate over contexts. 
Methods. Data from the second wave of the National Survey of Families and 
Households are combined with tract level data from the 1990 U.S. Census. A 
sub-sample of co-resident couples with a child aged 5–17 in the household 
was selected for analysis (n52,273). IPV is measured in three ways: as any 
physical violence reported by either partner in the year prior to the survey, as 
gendered violence in which both partners are identified as aggressors, and as 
severe violence in terms of injury and frequency.
Results. Regardless of how IPV is assessed, couples with IPV are more likely 
to present a vulnerable economic risk profile and to live in neighborhoods of 
high disadvantage. When economically vulnerable couples living in advantaged 
versus disadvantaged neighborhoods are compared, there are no significant 
differences in rates of IPV, regardless of the measure of IPV that is used. 
Neighborhood context matters, however, in comparisons among economi-
cally advantaged couples: rates of IPV are significantly higher among those in 
disadvantaged neighborhoods.
Conclusions. The consistency of effect for economic vulnerability and its 
invariance across neighborhood settings suggests that reducing economic 
vulnerability is likely to have beneficial effects in both disadvantaged and non-
disadvantaged neighborhoods.

Using data from a nationally representative survey and 
tract-level data from the 1990 Census, we investigate 
the intersection of two sources of contextual risk on 
the prevalence and severity of intimate partner violence 
(IPV). The sources of contextual risk are the economic 
profile of the household and the level of disadvantage 
of the neighborhood. Specifically, we ask how patterns 
of IPV vary across different levels of household eco-
nomic stress and neighborhood disadvantage. Is the 
link between economic status and IPV conditioned 
by the nature of the neighborhood setting? In neigh-
borhoods of concentrated disadvantage, do couples 
who are economically secure show the same levels of 
violence as economically vulnerable couples? Does IPV 
increase as sources of risk cascade or cumulate?
This study plumbs several fault lines in contem-
porary research on intimate partner violence. First, 
by differentiating between male-to-female violence 
and female-to-male violence, we directly engage the 
controversy about the prevalence and meaning of 
women’s violent aggression in couple-based violence.1–5 
Second, we also speak indirectly to the applicability of 
two competing perspectives on IPV: the family violence 
perspective, which looks for explanations of violence 
without regard to gender of perpetrator or victim; 
and the patriarchal control perspective, which views 
men’s violent aggression as a tool for maintenance of a 
gendered hierarchy of control.6–9 These two competing 
perspectives have been linked to couple-based patterns 
of violence, including common couple violence and 
intimate terrorism, and we are able to approximate 
these two patterns in our analyses.3,10 
Third, our focus on contextual factors in a couple’s 
social ecology permits us to go beyond the more 
common focus on individual-level explanatory factors 
in IPV and try to capture processes operative at an 
extra-individual level. The relative effectiveness of 
potential explanatory factors at different levels of 
analysis has seldom been assessed in a simultaneous 
model, although the relevance of economic factors to 
IPV has been identified consistently in research on 
IPV.11–15 The relevance of neighborhood characteristics 
to social behavior has a lengthy history of studies of 
street crime and other forms of social deviance. More 
recently, neighborhood effects in willingness to report 
incidents of IPV and prevalence of IPV have been 
found.4,16–18 Some have suggested that the nature of 
contextual risks is less important than their number.19 
That is, it is the accumulation of risk that is the critical 
factor. One of the issues that can be investigated here 
is whether contextual factors operate in concert, such 
that couples who face a high risk household economic 
environment along with a high risk neighborhood 
environment face double jeopardy in terms of their 
susceptibility to intimate partner aggression. This is 
the so-called “dual hazard” hypothesis.20 
In sum, in this report we compare two contextual 
or social ecological risks—vulnerable economic status 
and neighborhood disadvantage—in terms of their 
independent and joint association with three different 
aspects of couple-based physical aggression: the pres-
ence of any physical violence between the partners, 
the participation of both partners in aggression, and 
the severity of physical aggression. In so doing, we 
shed light on several current issues of approach and 
interpretation in research on IPV.

Household economic stress comprises the objective 
and subjective aspects of employment and income.21 
Objective conditions such as poverty or unemployment 
indicate a household under economic stress. In addi-
tion, feelings of anxiety and worry about finances or 
one’s employment stability may also indicate economic 
stress. 
Evidence linking economic stress to IPV is not hard 
to find. Although IPV is found in all social classes, rates 
tend to be higher in families of lower socio-economic 
status who are experiencing unemployment or under-
employment.22 Other research has found that economic 
stress predicts individual and family outcomes, includ-
ing family conflict and marital dissatisfaction.23,24
Several causal mechanisms have been proposed 
to explain the link between economic stress and IPV. 
Obviously, financial problems may lead to increased 
conflicts between partners and to feelings of stress that 
are expressed as physical aggression by either partner. 
Males experiencing job instability or poor earnings 
may feel especially frustrated or humiliated by their 
inability to provide for their families. These feelings 
may provoke them to use violence in verbal confronta-
tions with their partners as a way of establishing their 
authority.13,25,26 For example, MacMillan and Gartner 
found that employed wives whose husbands were 
unemployed were at greater risk of spousal aggression 
than wives in dual employment or dual unemployment 
partnerships.13 
The association between neighborhood disadvantage 
and violent crime rates (not including IPV) has been 
shown repeatedly.27–30 To interpret these links, theorists 
have long relied on, and in recent times extended, ideas

drawn from social disorganization theory.31–34 Recently, 
investigators have explored whether neighborhood dis-
advantage also influences IPV.4,16,35,36 Although theory 
explaining the relationship between neighborhood 
disadvantage and IPV is not yet well developed, several 
plausible hypotheses have been advanced. Garrett and 
Libbey suggest that family violence is more likely in 
disadvantaged neighborhoods because the residents 
of these neighborhoods are socially isolated from one 
another.37 This isolation means that the victims of 
family violence cannot count on support from neigh-
bors to help them stop or resist their victimization. 
Drawing on ideas developed by Sampson and Wilson, 
Benson et al. theorize that residents of disadvantaged 
neighborhoods that are low on collective efficacy may 
be unwilling to call the police in cases of domestic 
disputes.34,36 Their unwillingness may arise out of their 
weak ties to their neighbors or their acceptance of a 
general community norm that people are expected to 
mind their own business and stay out of the personal 
affairs of others. Even if most residents personally 
disapprove of IPV, they may be reluctant to express 
their disapproval openly. In this environment, violently 
inclined individuals may act aggressively against their 
partners because they have little to fear from either 
their neighbors or the police. 
Although there is evidence that both economic 
distress and neighborhood disadvantage are linked to 
IPV, it is not clear whether these risk factors operate 
additively, interactively, or completely independently. 
The dual-hazard hypothesis would suggest that eco-
nomically vulnerable couples located in disadvantaged 
neighborhoods are especially at risk of IPV because of 
the accumulation of risk factors.20 In a relevant analysis, 
Lauritsen and Schaum found an apparent interaction 
effect between family type and neighborhood disad-
vantage on women’s risk of IPV.4 They found that 
single women with children in disadvantaged areas 
had a higher risk of IPV than similar women in more 
well-to-do areas. Lauritsen and Schaum, however, did 
not look at the relationship between family economic 
vulnerability and neighborhood disadvantage as risk 
factors for IPV. 
metHods
This project relies upon secondary analysis of a data 
set constructed from two separate sources of data. We 
utilized the first two waves of the National Survey of 
Families and Households (NSFH),38 a nationally rep-
resentative sample survey of households that includes 
data on IPV as well as a range of individual and family 
measures. Census tract data were also abstracted from 
the 1990 U.S. Census39 and added as case-level indica-
tors of the sociodemographic and ecological context 
in which the individual respondent and household 
resided.
Data
Completed in 1988, the first wave of the NSFH included 
interviews with a probability sample of 13,007 adult 
respondents, representing 9,637 households. Face-
to-face interviews were conducted with a randomly 
selected primary respondent from each household. To 
facilitate the collection of sensitive information, por-
tions of the interview with the primary respondent were 
self-administered. In Wave 1, the respondent was given 
a paper instrument to fill out without the assistance 
of the interviewer, while in Wave 2 the respondent 
completed a computer-assisted form. The interviews 
lasted one hour and forty minutes on average. The 
primary respondent’s spouse or cohabiting partner, 
hereinafter referred to as the secondary respondent, was 
given a shorter self-administered questionnaire.40 
In Wave 2, completed in 1994, interviews were 
conducted with all surviving members of the original 
sample (n510,005, or 77% of respondents at Wave 1) 
and with the current spouse or cohabiting partner of 
the primary respondent (n55,624). Interviews were 
also conducted with the spouse or partner of the pri-
mary respondent in cases where the relationship had 
ended (n5789).38 This article is based on a sub-sample 
of 2,273 households in which the adult respondents 
were married or cohabiting at Wave 2 and in which at 
least one biological, step, or adopted child (aged 5–17) 
of the primary respondent was present.
Measures
Violence. In Wave 2 of the NSFH, both the primary 
and secondary respondents were asked if arguments 
became physical during the past year. Respondents 
were then asked how often during the past year fights 
with the respondent’s spouse or partner resulted in 
the respondent becoming “physically violent” with the 
partner. If the response was affirmative, a question 
asking how often such fights resulted in the spouse or 
partner becoming physically violent with the respon-
dent followed. There were five response categories, 
ranging from 0 to 4 or more. Next, respondents were 
asked whether any incident had resulted in the victim 
being “cut, bruised, or seriously injured.” In any of 
the questions, if the parties to the couple disagreed 
 422 
 Research Articles
Public Health Reports / July–August 2006 / Volume 121
in their reports about violence, we used the report of 
whichever respondent reported more violence.
These questions were used to create the couple’s 
violence profile, which consisted of the following cat-
egories: (1) neither partner reported violence by either 
party, (2) either or both partners reported violence by 
the female partner only, (3) either or both partners 
reported violence by the male partner only, (4) either 
or both partners reported violence by both partners, 
and (5) either or both partners reported violence but 
the directionality of the violence could not be deter-
mined. This non-directional measure of violence indi-
cates that at least one member of the couple reported 
that arguments in the past year had gotten physical, 
but the respondent did not complete the questions 
regarding who the aggressor was. The prevalence of 
couple violence over the past year in this sub-sample 
is found by aggregating across categories 2–5. 
The seriousness of violence against partners in 
intimate relationships can vary from a simple shove 
to homicide. The measures available in the NSFH are 
not well-suited to capturing extremely serious forms of 
violence. Nevertheless, because severity of violence is 
an important issue, we developed a measure to assess 
variation in the seriousness of violence in the NSFH 
using the limited information available. To assess the 
seriousness of violence in the partnership, we created 
ordinal measures that combined information on the 
number of violent incidents and on injuries. The vio-
lence severity variable groups couples into three catego-
ries: no violence; one-time violence without injury; and 
two or more violent incidents or violence with injury. 
This measure assesses the seriousness of IPV without 
regard to gender of offender or victim.
Risk profiles. In developing a profile of household eco-
nomic risk, we created quasi-family contexts that vary 
by the level of risk, following the example of Wikstrom 
and Loeber.41 Their strategy was to categorize families 
into low, balanced, or high risk contexts based upon 
selected risk and protective factors. Following their 
approach, we have done the following: based upon 
the frequency distribution of scores, we divided each 
component indicator into three categories using the 
25th and 75th percentiles as cut points. A score of 21 
was assigned for “low risk,” 0 for “mixed” or “medium” 
risk, and 11 for “high risk.” The household economic 
risk profile is a composite score, cumulated over the 
component factors and then categorized in the same 
way as “low,” “medium” or “mixed,” and “high” risk, 
with the 25th and 75th percentiles as cut points.
The couple’s household economic risk profile 
(Cronbach’s alpha50.60) comprised five variables. The 
family’s debt load (up to seven debts not including 
home mortgage or car loans), the father’s employment 
history over the course of the study (as indicated by his 
spells of unemployment of six months or more), the 
mother’s and father’s feelings of economic well-being 
(as indicated by financial satisfaction and worry), and 
the family’s income-to-needs ratio are used to assess 
whether households can be considered economically 
“vulnerable” (high risk), “balanced” (medium risk), 
or “secure” (low risk).
Because theory and prior research indicate that the 
IPV-related effects of community disadvantage are not 
linear across levels of disadvantage, we used a differ-
ent strategy to identify community risk.33,35 The theory 
of concentration effects predicts that below a certain 
level there will be little or no relationship between 
neighborhood disadvantage and various forms of 
crime.33 With respect to IPV, prior research supports 
this expectation.4,35 Hence, unlike our economic risk 
profile, which comprises three categories, our com-
munity risk profile has only two.
To measure neighborhood disadvantage, we were 
guided by the work of Sampson and colleagues.33,42 
Neighborhood disadvantage is based upon five census 
tract measures, including percent of single parents, 
percent non-white, percent unemployed, percent of 
families on public assistance, and percent below the 
poverty line. After transforming the items to z-scores, 
we summed them and divided by the number of indi-
cators to form the index of concentrated disadvantage 
(Cronbach’s alpha50.92). We then divided the result-
ing continuous variable into two categories at the 75th 
percentile.35
Analytic strategy
Our logic is straightforward in these analyses. We 
start with the expectation that economically distressed 
couples will show more IPV than economically secure 
couples. We also expect that couples in high risk, 
disadvantaged neighborhoods will evince more IPV 
than couples from more advantaged and lower risk 
neighborhoods. Recent research supports this expecta-
tion.18 Finally, the dual-hazard hypothesis suggests that 
couples in economically vulnerable households located 
in disadvantaged neighborhoods will be doubly at risk 
of negative interaction patterns, including physical 
aggression and violence.20 
There are two issues that complicate the interpreta-
tion of the effects of couple economic vulnerability and 
neighborhood disadvantage on IPV: selection effects 
and confounding effects. On one hand, it is not clear 
if the association of IPV with high community risk is a 
product of the community environment itself, or results

 423
Public Health Reports / July–August 2006 / Volume 121
instead from the tendency of violence-prone couples 
to live in high risk, disadvantaged communities; that is, 
the association may merely be a selection effect. 
On the other hand, the potential confounding of 
couple economic disadvantage with neighborhood 
disadvantage must be considered. If economically vul-
nerable couples are more likely to live in disadvantaged 
areas and if neighborhood disadvantage influences 
IPV, then it will appear that economic vulnerability has 
a stronger effect on IPV than it really does. In other 
words, the effects of couple economic vulnerability on 
IPV may be confounded with neighborhood disadvan-
tage, such that IPV is attributed solely to household 
economic factors rather than to neighborhood charac-
teristics. In addition, it is not clear that the association 
between family economic vulnerability and IPV holds 
uniformly across all kinds of communities. What is 
needed is to look at both family economic risk and 
community risk simultaneously to assess whether there 
is an additive or interactive effect on IPV, and this is 
what we do in the analyses that follow.

An overview of couple patterns of violence by their 
marital status and stability between the two waves of the 
NSFH is shown in Table 1. Looking at the sample as a 
whole, just over one in six couples (17.9%) reported 
some IPV in the past twelve months. Of those reporting

can be ascertained (9.5% of all couples), couples 
who reported that both partners engaged in violence 
outnumbered couples reporting only male-to-female 
violence by three to one (6.2% versus 2.0%) and they 
outnumbered couples reporting only female-to-male 
violence by nearly five to one (6.2% versus 1.3%). 
More serious levels of violence, including violence with 
injury, are reported by less than 5% of this sample. This 
rate of injurious or repeated violence is comparable to 
that found by other researchers using representative 
samples.43,44
As might be expected in a sample of households 
with school-aged children, stably married couples 
predominate; they also have the lowest rates of IPV 
overall over the past twelve months (16.2%). Cohabit-
ing couples show the highest rates of IPV, including 
serious violence. The chi square analyses suggest that 
marital status and stability are significantly associated 
with rates of IPV, consistent with other national surveys 
of IPV.15,45
Are couples with IPV differentially more likely to 
live in situations of higher risk on our family economic 
and neighborhood risk profiles? Table 2 answers 
unequivocally in the affirmative. Regardless of how IPV 
is assessed, couples with IPV are more likely to present 
a vulnerable economic risk profile and to live in neigh-
borhoods of high disadvantage. For example, among 
couples that reported IPV, 32.3% were economically 
vulnerable and 27.3% lived in disadvantaged neigh-
borhoods. In contrast, among couples that did not 
 424

report IPV, only 16.6% were economically vulnerable 
and only 18.3% lived in disadvantaged neighborhoods. 
Risks—from IPV, economic vulnerability, or neighbor-
hood disadvantage—tend to be closely associated with 
one another, such that a family subject to one is likely 
to experience the others as well. However, the risks do 
not overlap completely, and the association of various 
combinations of levels of risk with IPV is examined 
next in Table 3. 
Table 3 shows how IPV varies across different com-
binations of neighborhood disadvantage and house-
hold economic risk. In the first panel of Table 3, the

sion is shown; the second panel focuses on couples 
who report that both were violent; the third panel 
shows the distribution of serious violence with injury 
across combinations of risk. An initial comparison of 
the least risky (economically secure couples in advan-
taged neighborhoods) to the most risky (economically 
vulnerable couples in disadvantaged neighborhoods) 
combinations shows that IPV is considerably more likely 
to occur in couples in the high-risk situation (32.9% 
versus 9.4% for any IPV in the past twelve months, 
13.4% versus 2.0% for both partners violent, and, 
12.1% versus 1.3% for injurious violence). 
It is also clear that the patterns for the two risk 
factors are different. The risks that economic vulner-
ability poses for IPV are generally strong and stable 
across situations, as shown by the increasing propor-
tion of couples with IPV and statistically significant 
gammas as one moves from economically secure to 
economically vulnerable conditions within each of 
the neighborhood types. Among couples living in 
non-disadvantaged neighborhoods, economic vulner-
ability appears to be linearly associated with the risk 
of all forms of IPV. In disadvantaged neighborhoods 
the picture is more mixed. Economic vulnerability is

 425
Public Health Reports / July–August 2006 / Volume 121
linearly associated with our broadest measure of IPV 
in disadvantaged neighborhoods, where the risk of 
violence decreases from 32.9% for the economically 
vulnerable to 17.9% for economically secure. However, 
in cases where both partners report violence or where 
violence with injury is reported, there is a reversal of 
sorts in this pattern in disadvantaged neighborhoods. 
For these measures of IPV, couples who were in the 
middle in terms of economic vulnerability showed 
lower levels of violence than those who were more 
secure economically. Both the balanced and secure 
categories, however, showed lower levels of violence 
than the economically vulnerable. 
In one sense, these results would appear to support 
the dual-hazard hypothesis. As expected, economically 
vulnerable couples who live in disadvantaged neigh-
borhoods display higher levels of IPV than any other 
risk profile group. But a closer look at Table 3 calls 
this interpretation into question. When economi-
cally vulnerable couples located in different types of 
neighborhoods are compared (i.e., advantaged versus 
disadvantaged), there are no significant differences 
in rates of IPV, regardless of the measure of IPV that 
is used. In other words, an economically vulnerable 
couple located in a disadvantaged neighborhood does 
not face a significantly greater risk of IPV than a similar 
couple located in an advantaged neighborhood. This 
result runs counter to the dual-hazard hypothesis. On 
the other hand, where the level of neighborhood dis-
advantage does appear to matter is with couples who 
are more secure economically, particularly where both 
members report violence and where violence involves 
injury. For example, for economically secure couples 
located in advantaged neighborhoods, the percentage 
of both partners reporting violence is 2.0, but for simi-
larly secure couples in disadvantaged neighborhoods 
the percentage is 9.5, and the difference is significant. 
Similar intriguing, counterintuitive, and significant pat-
terns are observed among the balanced couples.

The choice to engage in physical aggression with 
one’s intimate partner is inherently social behavior 
subject to a multiplicity of sources of influence. In 
this article, we have examined two sources of extra-
individual influence—the couple’s economic condi-
tion and the character of the neighborhood in which 
they live. We anticipated and found that the degree 
of vulnerability in a couple’s household economic 
context was consistently associated with engagement 
in IPV, whether assessed as any violence, as conjoint 
or mutual violence with both partners as attackers and 
victims, or as serious violence with injury. Moreover, 
this relationship was largely consistent with regard 
to neighborhood context; that is, whether living in 
advantaged or disadvantaged neighborhoods, the most 
economically vulnerable couples have the highest likeli-
hood of couple violence. 
However, we also anticipated that neighborhood 
context might by itself influence IPV. Might residence 
in a “good” neighborhood provide a damper on cou-
ple violence, even for those in precarious economic 
conditions, perhaps through the influence of shared 
expectations for civility and comity in public and pri-
vate behaviors? Can economic security forestall IPV in 
a neighborhood in which nearly everyone is living on 
the margins of poverty? The findings showed a clear 
neighborhood effect for the economically balanced 
and secure couples. However, for the economically 
vulnerable couples it does not seem to matter where 
they are located; they always have higher rates of IPV 
than couples who are under less economic strain. 
Overall, this pattern of results mirrors what Wikstrom 
and Loeber41 found for delinquents. In their study, 
neighborhood disadvantage had no effect on young 
people who were at-risk, but it did seem to push “good 
kids” towards delinquency.41 
Thus, in addition to a significant direct effect of 
economic hardship on IPV, we have a clear indication 
of a significant direct effect of neighborhood context 
on those couples who are not economically vulnerable. 
This pattern of findings calls into question the dual-
hazard or double jeopardy hypothesis that economically 
at-risk couples fare especially badly in disadvantaged 
neighborhoods. It would appear that neighborhoods 
affect the economically less vulnerable couples more. 
The apparent lack of a neighborhood effect on eco-
nomically vulnerable couples suggests that in these 
couples IPV is affected more by individual- and couple-
level characteristics than by contextual conditions.
The NSFH has been routinely criticized for measur-
ing IPV only in the context of a couple’s arguments 
and for providing a misleading picture of the gendered 
nature of IPV by overestimating the participation of 
women as equal combatants in couple violence.5,46 
However, other recent research using representative 
samples also finds substantial amounts of female-to-
male violence. Indeed, if there is violence in a rela-
tionship, it appears more likely that both members are 
violent than that only one is.43,44 We have used three 
measures specifically to allow for an examination of 
IPV from different vantage points, and throughout our 
analyses we have found generally similar patterns across 
all three measures used to assess IPV. It is notable that 
we find support for the relevance of contextual factors

that supercede individual characteristics, including 
gender, in accounting for patterns of IPV.
We conclude by returning to our main findings 
about the importance of social contexts to IPV. Given 
the consistency of effect for economic vulnerability 
and its invariance across neighborhood settings, it is 
especially disconcerting to note that economic distress 
and uncertainty affect increasing numbers of Ameri-
cans. Our findings suggest that the private behaviors 
of couples in their homes cannot be separated either 
from their local neighborhood settings or from the 
larger political economy, and that as economic despair 
begins to displace economic confidence, an increase 
in the prevalence of IPV will not lag far behind.
On the other hand, our failure to find support for 
the dual-hazard hypothesis may have positive implica-
tions. If the hypothesis were true, this would suggest 
that reducing IPV among economically vulnerable 
couples would be especially difficult in disadvantaged 
neighborhoods. IPV would be a function of two 
things—economic vulnerability and neighborhood dis-
advantage—one of which is extra-individual. Programs 
to reduce IPV that focused exclusively on helping indi-
viduals overcome economic vulnerability would be less 
effective in these neighborhoods. However, our results 
suggest that the dual hazard hypothesis is not correct 
with respect to IPV. Reducing economic vulnerability is 
likely to have beneficial effects in both disadvantaged 
and non-disadvantaged neighborhoods.
