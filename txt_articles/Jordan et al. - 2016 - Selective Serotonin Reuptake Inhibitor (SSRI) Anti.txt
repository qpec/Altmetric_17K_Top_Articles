Abstract
Background
Hypothesised associations between in utero exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibi-
tors (SSRIs) and congenital anomalies, particularly congenital heart defects (CHD), remain
controversial. We investigated the putative teratogenicity of SSRI prescription in the 91 days
either side of first day of last menstrual period (LMP).
Methods and Findings
Three population-based EUROCAT congenital anomaly registries- Norway (2004–2010),
Wales (2000–2010) and Funen, Denmark (2000–2010)—were linked to the electronic
healthcare databases holding prospectively collected prescription information for all preg-
nancies in the timeframes available. We included 519,117 deliveries, including foetuses ter-
minated for congenital anomalies, with data covering pregnancy and the preceding quarter,
including 462,641 with data covering pregnancy and one year either side. For SSRI expo-
sures 91 days either side of LMP, separately and together, odds ratios with 95% confidence
intervals (ORs, 95%CI) for all major anomalies were estimated. We also explored: pausing
or discontinuing SSRIs preconception, confounding, high dose regimens, and, in Wales,
diagnosis of depression. Results were combined in meta-analyses. SSRI prescription 91
days either side of LMP was associated with increased prevalence of severe congenital
heart defects (CHD) (as defined by EUROCAT guide 1.3, 2005) (34/12,962 [0.26%] vs.
865/506,155 [0.17%] OR 1.50, 1.06–2.11), and the composite adverse outcome of ’anomaly
or stillbirth’ (473/12962, 3.65% vs. 15829/506,155, 3.13%, OR 1.13, 1.03–1.24). The

 increased prevalence of all major anomalies combined did not reach statistical significance
(3.09% [400/12,962] vs. 2.67% [13,536/506,155] OR 1.09, 0.99–1.21). Adjusting for socio-
economic status left ORs largely unchanged. The prevalence of anomalies and severe CHD
was reduced when SSRI prescriptions were stopped or paused preconception, and
increased when >1 prescription was recorded, but differences were not statistically signifi-
cant. The dose-response relationship between severe CHD and SSRI dose (meta-regres-
sion OR 1.49, 1.12–1.97) was consistent with SSRI-exposure related risk. Analyses in
Wales suggested no associations between anomalies and diagnosed depression.
Conclusion
The additional absolute risk of teratogenesis associated with SSRIs, if causal, is small. How-
ever, the high prevalence of SSRI use augments its public health importance, justifying
modifications to preconception care.
Introduction
Exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) during the first trimester of preg-
nancy, including the crucial period of organogenesis (the first 49 days after implantation)[1],
affects 4% of pregnant women in the USA[2] and UK[3]. SSRI prescribing indications, mainly
depression, panic, obsessive-compulsive or social anxiety disorders, and, for fluoxetine,
bulimia nervosa, are not always recorded [3]. SSRIs, particularly fluoxetine and citalopram,
and their metabolites, cross the placenta[4], and appear in cord blood[5,6]; their presence in
amniotic fluid prolongs foetal exposure. SSRIs, and some other antidepressants, act on the cru-
cial serotonin transporter (SERT, aka 5HTT, SLC6A4, OMIM 182138), which regulates the
synaptic concentration of serotonin (5HT) in many tissues, including the placenta[7]. The
resultant increased bioavailability of serotonin affects vasoconstriction and coagulation or
bruising [6,8,9], cardiac morphogenesis [10,11], CNS development[6] gastrulation, laterality
and craniofacial development[10], conferring biological plausibility on reported associations
between SSRI exposure during organogenesis and certain congenital anomalies.
The full impact of exposure to SSRIs in utero is incompletely understood, and not all prob-
lems initially suspected [12] have been confirmed by further investigation. Some[13–16], but
not all[17–22], observational studies indicate significant associations between SSRI exposure
during organogenesis and all congenital anomalies combined. Risks may be confined to spe-
cific SSRIs and specific anomalies[23,24]. However, the literature offers no consistency: parox-
etine is implicated in some studies[24],[25], and fluoxetine[24,26,27], citalopram/ escitalopram
[17,27] and sertraline[17,28] in others. Meta-analyses[26,29,30] and analysis of 12 EUROCAT
registries[31] indicate an overall association between SSRI exposure and congenital heart
defects (CHD); however, there is no consensus[21,22,29,32,33]. The most persistent associa-
tions relate to paroxetine exposure and CHD[22,24,27,30,31], particularly at doses >25mg/day
[34]. Epidemiologists also report increased risks of: neural tube defects[33,35], ano-rectal ste-
nosis/ atresia[23], gastroschisis, omphalocele[35], renal dysplasia, hypospadias[27], limb
reduction[23], talipes equinovarus (clubfoot)[23], craniosynostosis[35], anomalies of the eye
[18], ear, face[36], respiratory[36] and digestive tracts[15,24].
To investigate the putative teratogenicity of SSRIs, three countries from the pan-European
congenital anomalies registry network[37,38] were linked with healthcare databases. We

 aimed to examine any associations between major congenital anomalies and: prescription of
antidepressant medicines in the 91 days either side of the 1st day of last menstrual period
(LMP); high dose SSRI regimens; confounding; pausing or stopping SSRI pharmacotherapy
before pregnancy; and diagnosed, unmedicated depression.
Methods
Three population-based cohorts containing prospectively collected linked prescription data
were interrogated using a common protocol. Ethical and data access approvals were obtained
for each country from the relevant governance infrastructures (see acknowledgements).
Settings
Three congenital anomalies registries that contribute to EUROCAT[37,39] were linked with
prescription and healthcare databases covering their source populations[40,41]. We examined
anonymised linked routinely collected data on congenital anomalies, primary care prescribing
(Wales) or dispensing (Denmark, Norway), concurrent maternal diagnoses and demographic
indicators from:
1. Denmark’s Medical Birth registry, Danish national Prescription and Patient registers, Sta-
tistics Denmark[42] and the Funen, Denmark (Odense) EUROCAT register.
2. Norway’s Medical Birth Registry, containing all EUROCAT cases, linked to the National
Prescription Database and the National Education Database[43,44].
3. Wales’ health and social care linked electronic databank (the Secure Anonymised Informa-
tion Linkage [SAIL]). SAIL links primary care records, including prescriptions, for ~40% of
the population to the Office of National Statistics births and deaths register, the National
Community Child Health Database (NCCHD), the Patient Episode Database for Wales and
CARIS (Congenital Anomaly Register and Information Service for Wales). All general prac-
tices were invited to participate, without payment, and ~40% had done so in 2014[45,46].
Databases were linked by trusted third parties (Statistics Denmark, Statistics Norway in
conjunction with the National Prescription Database, NHS Wales Informatics Service) using
unique personal identifiers, which remained undisclosed to researchers, ensuring anonymity.
The 3 countries have similar population sizes and life expectancies, but differ in: GDP per
capita (Wales $23.90k [47] Denmark $50.46, Norway $72.96K[48]; the proportion of children
living in poverty, defined as <60% median household income (Wales 28% [49], Denmark 7%
and Norway 8% [50]); and unemployment rates (Wales 5.3%, Denmark 3.9% and Norway
3.4%)[47,48], (2006 data). Much of Wales is an EU Convergence area [51].
Study population
The study population included all foetuses and infants who 1) would have appeared in the
EUROCAT registries had they been diagnosed with a major congenital anomaly, 2) had linked
maternal prescription data, and 3) whose birth outcome was either live birth or still birth/ late
foetal death after 20 weeks (24 weeks in Wales) or termination of pregnancy for foetal anomaly
(TOPFA) recorded in the EUROCAT register. Deliveries from 1st January 2000 to 31st Decem-
ber 2010 were included in Wales and Denmark. In Norway, all pregnancies with date of LMP
after April 1st 2004 and ending before 31st December 2010 were included, to coincide with the
start of the prescription database. In Wales, infants were included where the associated mater-
nal ID was in the geographical areas that could be linked with the primary care dataset and the

 record was complete[41]. We prepared 2 datasets with an inclusion criterion relating to the
woman’s time on the linked database with prescription information:
1. 91 days before LMP to delivery (birth or TOPFA) (main analysis)
2. 365 days before LMP to 365 days after delivery
Information on start of pregnancy was obtained from ultrasound scan data recorded in the
Medical Birth Registers of Norway and Denmark (MBRN, MBRD), and the NCCHD for
Wales [41]. Representivity was checked in Denmark and Wales by comparing socioeconomic
status (SES) with national populations.
Exposure
Exposure was defined as one or more prescription for an antidepressant issued (Wales) or dis-
pensed (Norway & Denmark) 91 days either side of the first day of LMP. We based our time-
frame on prescription duration (typically 90 days) and relevant pharmacokinetic parameters:
for example elimination of the active metabolite of fluoxetine can take ~40 days in adults[52],
and longer in the embryo or foetus[11]. Antidepressants were investigated according to ana-
tomical, therapeutic, chemical (ATC) classification [53]: 1) grouped a) all SSRIs (NO6AB); b)
all antidepressants (NO6A); 2) as individual SSRIs, fluoxetine, citalopram, paroxetine, sertra-
line, escitalopram, fluvoxamine. Where more than one SSRI had been prescribed, exposure
was not allocated to either SSRI; women switching were retained as SSRI exposed. Where non-
SSRI antidepressants were co-prescribed, exposure was classified according to the SSRI. Den-
mark supplied data on SSRIs only.
Dose was calculated from tablet and capsule sizes, to avoid missing data. We classified high
dose exposure as prescription of: 60mg fluoxetine, 40mg citalopram, 30mg paroxetine, 100mg
sertraline, 20mg escitalopram, based on tablet/ capsule sizes quoted in the British National
Formulary (BNF)[54]. Smaller tablets and capsules were classified as ‘other dose’ (low or
medium).
Outcomes
Major congenital anomalies were classified according to the EUROCAT standard subgroups,
as defined in EUROCAT Guide 1.3, chapter 2.2 [37]. Severe CHD was defined as ICD10
codes: Q200 (common arterial trunk), Q203 (discordant ventriculoarterial connection), Q204
(double inlet ventricle), Q212 (atrio-ventricular septal defect), Q2121 (primum atrial septal
defect [ASD]), Q213 (tetralogy of Fallot), Q220 (pulmonary valve atresia), Q224 (tricuspid ste-
nosis or atresia), Q225 (Ebstein’s anomaly), Q226 (hypoplastic right heart), Q230 (stenosis or
atresia of aortic valve), Q234 (hypoplastic left heart), Q251 (co-arctation of aorta), Q262 (total
anomalous pulmonary venous connection). Patent ductus arteriosus in pre-term infants was
not included as CHD. Minor anomalies are not recorded in EUROCAT, and not investigated.
Congenital anomaly cases, diagnosed within the first year of life, irrespective of mother’s time
on database, were as reported to EUROCAT: October 2014 (Wales), February 2012 (Den-
mark), February 2014 (Norway). We excluded, from the main analysis, subjects with anoma-
lies of chromosomal (EUROCAT subgroup al88) or genetic (al104, al105 & al108) aetiology,
including sequences[37].
We analysed as prior hypotheses associations between SSRI prescription and 10 pre-speci-
fied anomalies identified from the literature as associated with SSRI exposure[31]: CHD,
severe CHD, neural tube defects, ano-rectal atresia/stenosis, renal dysplasia, craniosynostosis,
hypospadias, including 3 anomalies associated with vasoconstriction (limb reduction, abdomi-
nal wall defects (gastroschisis and omphalocele) [55,56], and talipes equinovarus[57]. e

 Abdominal wall defects (gastroschisis, Q792, omphalocele, Q793 and other wall defects, Q795)
were combined to achieve sufficient numbers to report, considering their purported common
aetiology (vasoconstriction of the omphalomesenteric artery) [58,59].
The composite outcomes, all major anomalies combined and major congenital anomalies
or stillbirth, were based on the ICH (International Conference on Harmonisation) definition
of serious adverse events[60].
Confounding
To minimise confounding by co-exposure, we achieved a relatively homogeneous population
by excluding infants: 1) with EUROCAT coding[37] indicating known teratogenic syndromes
(EUROCAT subgroups al82-84, al86) 2) exposed to medicines more closely associated with
congenital anomalies than SSRIs during the 91 days either side of 1st day of LMP: anti-epileptic
drugs (AEDs) (NO3)[61]; coumarins (B01AA), mainly warfarin[62]; insulins (A10A)[63]. We
examined, but did not exclude, SSRI exposed cases for: 1) exposure to other potentially terato-
genic prescription medicines 91 days either side of 1st day of LMP: systemic isotretinoin
(D10BA); angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II blockers (C09); lithium
(NO5AN); benzodiazepines (N05BA); first generation antipsychotics (N05AA through
N05AG); second generation antipsychotics (N05AH, N05AL, N05AX); carbimazole (H03BB);
thyroxine (N03AA); medicines rarely prescribed in primary care but associated with anoma-
lies: aminoglycosides, ergot derivatives, lindane, gold salts, penicillamine, methotrexate, chlo-
roquine, radiopharmaceuticals[64]; 2) heavy alcohol use and substance misuse (Wales only);
3) maternal conditions indicating that the woman might not be considered to be from the nor-
mal healthy population: hospital admission for cancer; thyroid disorders; phenylketonuria;
maternal congenital anomalies[65]; 4) maternal siblings with anomalies.
To explore confounding by indication (usually depressive illness [66]) we investigated
whether women who discontinued prescriptions before the time when a biological effect
would be expected (91 days before LMP) had similar risks to those receiving SSRI prescrip-
tions during the vulnerable period (91 days either side of LMP). Those who discontinued were
divided into those who did and did not resume prescriptions within a year of delivery. We
defined:
• ‘paused SSRI exposure’ as �1 prescription during the 3–12 months before pregnancy plus
�1 prescription during the year after pregnancy and no prescriptions during both the quar-
ter preceding pregnancy and pregnancy.
• discontinuation (stopping) as �1 prescription during the 3–12 months before pregnancy
and no further prescriptions throughout the quarter preceding pregnancy, pregnancy, and
the first year after delivery.
As a sensitivity analysis, we repeated this analysis defining exposure as >1 prescription in
each time period (1 year to 91 days before LMP, LMP ± 91 days, 1 year after delivery).
Statistical analysis
For each country separately, we explored associations between pre-specified outcomes (above)
plus each congenital anomaly subgroup and all SSRIs, individual SSRIs, and all antidepres-
sants. For exploration of individual SSRIs, those exposed to other SSRIs were excluded from
the analysis. The odds of exposure for subjects with and without each anomaly were compared
by calculating odds ratios (ORs) with Cornfield 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). For anom-
alies with >2 exposed cases in the 3 countries combined, meta-analysis of country-specific
effects was undertaken, using the Mantel Haenszel method, with alternative continuity

 corrections, described by Sweeting et al. (2004)[67]. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2
statistic. We repeated the analysis of all SSRIs excluding infants exposed to any non-SSRI anti-
depressants (e.g. SNRIs, tricyclic antidepressants); data availability restricted this to Norway &
Wales. When evaluating associations other than the 10 pre-specified signals, we applied Simes’
multiple testing procedure to control the false discovery rate to 5% (FDR) [68,69]. For ‘all
anomalies’, ‘anomalies + stillbirths’, CHD, and severe CHD, confounding by smoking and
socio-economic status were explored in separate fixed effects logistic regression models. The
SSRI dose-response relationships for all anomalies, CHD, severe CHD and ‘anomaly or still-
birth’ were explored for zero, ‘other’ and high doses, using random effects meta-regression.
Analyses were performed using Stata 12.1[70].
Wales sub-cohort
In Wales, confounding by indication was further explored by investigating depression and
unmedicated depression, defined as a diagnosis of depression in the woman’s record any time
during her registration with a participating GP before the end of the first trimester, but no
antidepressant prescribed in the 91 days either side of the 1st day of LMP. We explored associa-
tions between prespecified anomalies [31], and socioeconomic status (as Townsend fifth),
smoking, antipsychotics, substance misuse and heavy drinking and Down syndrom [71] in a
posteriori subgroups, to generate hypotheses for future work. Substance misuse often coincides
with heavy drinking, and vice versa, and we combined the two exposures. We took recorded
diagnoses of misuse at any time as indicative of a problem likely to recur. Analyses were under-
taken in SPSS version 20 for Windows[72].
Results
The population comprised 519,117 subjects (foetuses and infants): 346,739 from Norway;
56447 from Funen, Denmark; 115,931 from Wales (Tables Aa-Ac in S1 Appendix, Fig 1). In
Wales, the included population were less deprived than the rest of Wales [41]. There were no
significant demographic differences between Funen County and ‘all Denmark’. Exposure to
SSRIs and antidepressants and prevalence of non-chromosomal, non-genetic congenital
anomalies were higher in Wales than the Scandinavian countries (Table 1). Norway had the
lowest prescription rates for paroxetine, >1 type of SSRI and high doses (Table 2).
The prevalence of major congenital anomalies was higher amongst those exposed to SSRI
prescriptions 91 days either side of 1st day of LMP (3.09%) than those unexposed (2.67%);
however, this was not statistically significant (OR 1.09, 0.99–1.21, Table 3). Exposure was sig-
nificantly associated with the composite adverse outcome ‘any major anomaly or stillbirth’
(OR 1.13, 1.03–1.24, [Table 3], number needed to harm [NNH] 192, 95% CI 118–512), severe
CHD (OR 1.50, 1.06–2.11, NNH 1094, 555–38,141), and abdominal wall defects (OR 1.75,
1.07–2.88, NNH 1629, 832–39,830).
We did not confirm associations between SSRIs and all CHD, neural tube defects, talipes
equinovarus, hypospadias, renal dysplasia, ano-rectal atresia/stenosis, limb reduction or cra-
niosynostosis. The association with gastroschisis did not reach statistical significance (OR 1.92,
0.97–3.78, based on 9 exposed cases, Table C in S1 Appendix). Non-significant positive associ-
ations involved all individual SSRIs, and included paroxetine with all CHD and ventricular
septal defect (VSD), fluoxetine with neural tube defects and citalopram with hypospadias. Esci-
talopram was associated with talipes equinovarus and abdominal wall defects (Tables Ba, C in
S1 Appendix). For all antidepressants, differences in prevalence of major anomalies between
exposed and unexposed were less marked and not statistically significant (OR 1.03, 0.93–1.13)
(Tables Bb, C in S1 Appendix). There were <3 exposed cases for 27/75 anomalies (Tables Ba,

 Bb in S1 Appendix). When Simes’ False Discovery Rate procedure was applied, no associations
reached the 5% false discovery rate significance level threshold, including those with diaphrag-
matic hernia and syndactyly (Table D in S1 Appendix). When data were re-analysed in Nor-
way and Wales, with those co-prescribed other antidepressants excluded, prevalence rates
and ORs changed little (Table C in S1 Appendix). Heterogeneity was low for most outcomes,
except CHD and severe CHD (Table 3). The NNH for severe CHD varied: 298 (172–11,111) in
Denmark, 854 (400–14,286) in Wales, and there was no association in Norway.
Dose-response
A minority were exposed to prescriptions for high doses of SSRIs (Table 2). Meta-regression
for the 3 categories (high, other and zero dose) indicated significant associations for severe
CHD and ‘anomaly or stillbirth’ and non-significant trends for all anomalies and CHD
(Table 4). Denmark had a higher proportion of both high dose exposures and severe CHD.

Analyses of SNRI exposure in Wales and Norway are in Table Bb and EMC (2015) [41] (Denmark was unable to supply data on SNRIs). There were 1448 SNRI exposures and 46
exposed cases (3.18%) (OR 1.14, 0.85–1.53). No associations with anomalies listed above where 95% confidence intervals did not include one were identified.

 Confounding by co-exposure
Adjusting for smoking and SES made little difference to ORs. Adjusting for smoking reduced
the numbers of exposed cases, due to missing data disproportionately affecting the cases
(Table Aa in S1 Appendix) and uncertainty over ex-smokers, and hence widened confidence
intervals (Table 5). Checks indicated that: 52 of the 400 exposed cases had been exposed to pre-
scription medicines identified as potentially teratogenic (listed under ‘confounding’), benzodi-
azepines (21) thyroxine (13), antipsychotics first generation (9), second generation (5),
angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (3), lithium (1), and 0 for all other exposures; 30
were exposed to maternal ill-health; 14 had siblings in the dataset with anomalies, and 12 had
mothers with an anomaly recorded. Of the 34 exposed severe CHD cases, 6 were also exposed
to potential teratogens of varying potency, benzodiazepines (2 or <5), thyroxine (2), lithium
(1), and first generation antipsychotics (1), 2 were exposed to maternal ill-health and none had
maternal siblings or mothers with any congenital anomaly.

When SES was examined as a linear trend, results were essentially unchanged. The decision to compare the most deprived with the rest was based on
data in Tables E, F in S1 Appendix.
Numbers were too low for adjusted analyses in some anomalies of interest, including abdominal wall defects. In Wales, abdominal wall defects and SSRI
exposure were associated with smoking and SES (Table F in S1 Appendix).

 Confounding by indication
a) Exposure patterns.
Including only women present in the database from 1 year before
to 1 year after pregnancy reduced the population (Fig 1), but left prevalence of anomalies and
SSRI exposure largely unchanged. Prevalence appeared lowest in those never exposed, increas-
ing in stoppers, pausers and those exposed during pregnancy, but differences were not statisti-
cally significant. The prevalence of severe CHD appeared lower (0.23%) in those prescribed
�1 SSRI prescription(s) in the 91 days either side of LMP than those receiving >1 prescription
(0.31%) (Table 6 and Table G in S1 Appendix).
b) Depression in Wales.
For women present on the database during pregnancy and 1
year either side (n = 103,204), a recorded diagnosis of depression (ever) was not associated
with increased prevalence of all anomalies (OR 1.01, 0.91–1.12, Table 7 and Table H in S1
Appendix). The prevalence of anomalies amongst those with a diagnosis of depression, med-
icated (3.22%) or unmedicated (3.19%) (Table H in S1 Appendix), was slightly lower than
following SSRI exposure, regardless of diagnosis (3.44%) (Table 1), but such differences
were not statistically significant. More infants exposed to medicated than unmedicated
depression had severe CHD (OR 1.60, 0.70–3.66), but numbers were low (Table 7 and
Table H in S1 Appendix).
Deprivation was associated with depression and SSRI prescription (Table E in S1 Appen-
dix). We found no significant associations between all anomalies, ‘anomalies and stillbirths’,
CHD, severe CHD and: smoking, substance misuse or heavy drinking, antipsychotics or depri-
vation. Abdominal wall defects were associated with deprivation and smoking (Table F in S1
Appendix).
In subgroups of women in Wales recorded (ever) as heavy drinkers or substance misusers,
the most deprived fifth, those prescribed antipsychotics within 91 days of LMP, and smokers,
additional SSRI exposure appeared to increase the prevalence of congenital anomalies
(Table 8).

 Discussion
Congenital anomalies appeared more prevalent amongst infants exposed than unexposed to
prescription of SSRIs within 91 days of 1st day of LMP, consistent with recent meta-analyses
[26,30,73]; this difference was not statistically significant. However, the increase was significant
for the composite adverse outcome of ‘anomaly or stillbirth’ (OR 1.13, 1.03–1.24, NNH 192).
Significant dose-response relationships were found between SSRI prescription and ‘anomaly
or stillbirth’ and severe CHD (meta-regression ORs 1.10, 1.02–1.20, and 1.49, 1.12–1.97), sup-
porting work on paroxetine[34] and umbilical cord samples[74], but contrary to reports with
fewer exposed cases[15], and different classifications[32].
The literature’s inconsistency regarding SSRIs and CHD is reflected in our incongruent
findings for all CHD and severe CHD. The dose-response association between SSRI prescrip-
tion and severe CHD (Table 4) appears stronger than for all CHD, but there is insufficient
power to test this hypothesis. The association with severe CHD supports some studies
[15,30,31], while the absence of association with all CHD reflects others[22,29,32,33], suggest-
ing that SSRIs may only affect certain cardiac anomalies. As elsewhere, paroxetine was associ-
ated with all CHD and VSD[26,31,33], possibly attributable to its saturation kinetics[47].
Some previously reported associations were confined to a single SSRI: neural tube defects
[33,35] with fluoxetine (OR 2.57, 1.21–5.46), escitalopram with talipes equinovarus[52], citalo-
pram with hypospadias [27,75] (Table C in S1 Appendix). Genetic variation[76] and induction
of the cytochrome P450 system, essential for SSRI metabolism, which occurs early in preg-
nancy, may reduce SSRI bioavailability and mitigate any adverse impact[51,77], particularly at
standard doses.
Depression and social stressors are associated with activation of the hypothalamic-pitui-
tary-adrenal (HPA) axis, pro-inflammatory cytokines[78], and placental equivalents[79],

 which affect organogenesis[80], foetal growth[81], and birth outcome[82]. We found no asso-
ciation between anomalies linked with maternal social stressors (oro-facial clefts)[83] and
SSRIs, antidepressants or depression (Table 7 and Tables C, H in S1 Appendix). This intimates
that independent serotoninergic[11] and vasoconstrictor[9,50] mechanisms might underlie
adverse outcomes following SSRI exposure [84]. SSRI-induced vasoconstriction[9,51] may
explain associations between SSRIs and low birth weight, growth restriction[85–87], and per-
sistent pulmonary hypertension[88], contributing to synergy in our composite adverse out-
come. (Growth restriction accounts for 43% of stillbirths [89]). Stillbirth is a relatively rare
outcome (prevalence <0.5%), not previously associated with SSRI exposure[90,91].

1.98).

 Adjusting for smoking and SES left findings largely unchanged (Table 5), as elsewhere
[16,28]. Exploration in Wales found no evidence for major confounding, except for abdominal
wall defects (Table F in S1 Appendix). Excluding subjects exposed to insulin, AEDs and cou-
marins reduced the need to adjust for co-exposure[32]. SSRI prescription conferred additional
risks on those co-exposed to substance misuse or heavy drinking or other psychoactive medi-
cines[17,92–95] (Table 8).
To disentangle SSRI exposure from depression, like others [15], we compared those
exposed to SSRIs with those where prescriptions had been stopped or paused. Although preva-
lence of ‘all anomalies’ and severe CHD was lower in those who stopped rather than continued
prescriptions, confidence intervals were wide, indicating limited power of this analysis and the
presence of confounding (Table 6 and Table G in S1 Appendix). In Wales, we analysed ‘any
record of depression’, based on practitioners’ reluctance to repeat data entries and the ‘depres-
sion diathesis model’, which suggests that any episode may predispose to stressor-induced
release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, permanently altering hippocampal, prefrontal and
frontocingulate neurochemistry and connections[78]. We found no associations between
depression and anomalies (Table 7 and Table H in S1 Appendix), supporting suggestions that
depression and antidepressants may act separately[84,96] in modifying release of pro-inflam-
matory cytokines that affect organogenesis. Similarly, meta-analysis indicates that increased
risks of preterm birth persist when SSRI exposed are compared with unmedicated controls
diagnosed with depression [97]. Our definition of depression (any record, ever) may contrib-
ute to incongruence with other reports[22,98]. We acknowledge that prescription or resump-
tion or higher doses of SSRIs may indicate on-going, recurrent or more severe depression,
compounding the difficulties of disentangling the effects of prescriptions from underlying
illness.
Strengths and limitations
Findings are strengthened by: precise diagnostic coding of congenital anomalies [37]; inclu-
sion of TOPFA cases and stillbirths; contemporary controls; accounting for exposure to other
antidepressants and SES; prospective data[99], free from recall bias [100]: these may explain
differences with the published literature [15,16,24,32,33]. Most infants exposed to SSRIs in
early pregnancy were not exposed in late pregnancy [3], reducing any over-ascertainment of
anomalies in neonatal assessments of ‘high risk’ infants: the main concern is conflation of ASD
with patent foramen ovale, which is precluded by EUROCAT coding [37]. Where associations
were observed, effects were modest (ORs below 2), and the low numbers of exposed cases
necessitate cautious interpretation, but the associations with severe CHD and ‘major anomaly
or stillbirth’ are strengthened by dose-response relationships[101]. Generalization of findings
on ‘all anomalies’, with or without stillbirths is strengthened by consistency across different
populations (I2 = 0 for both analyses) (Table 3 and Table C in S1 Appendix). Our findings are
limited by: dilution of exposure; incomplete recording in electronic databases; and study size.
Our effect sizes may be conservative and ORs diluted by our extended exposure window,
and threats to prescription adherence. Our extended time window before LMP (91 days) was
based on typical prescription duration and pharmacokinetic parameters, which differ between
SSRIs. We acknowledge that this may have led to some unexposed subjects being misclassified
as exposed, diluting ORs [102], particularly for SSRIs with shorter half-lives (citalopram, ser-
traline, escitalopram, and low dose paroxetine)[47], possibly explaining divergent findings
[16,32,103].
Adherence to prescribed regimens cannot be ascertained from prescription or dispensing
data. However, it is more likely where >1 prescription is issued, and therefore our stronger

 findings when analysing women exposed to >1 prescription are consistent with dilution due
to exposure misclassification from non-adherence. International differences in exposure
observed may, in part, reflect differences in issued (Wales) versus redeemed (Norway, Den-
mark) prescriptions. Prescription non-redemption varies between settings; reviewers suggest a
mean of 16.4% (range 11–19%)[104]. For antidepressants, estimates range from 20% in the
USA where affordability is a prominent concern[105], to 4% in the Netherlands [106] and
4.5% (CNS medicines) in UK primary care [107].
Electronic cohorts based on prospectively collected routine data facilitate pharmacovigi-
lance across whole populations; however, clinical details (other than EUROCAT coding)
including indications for prescriptions and severity of illness, confounding variables and geno-
type may be incompletely recorded. Dose-response explorations were based on tablet size, and
we were unable to take account of formulation or number of tablets or packets prescribed.
Genetic vulnerability to environmental factors, including SSRIs, is hypothesised [76], but
rarely recorded. Some anomalies, including some not associated with recognised syndromes,
can result from inherited conditions[108]. However, family histories tend to be incompletely
recorded, and there may be no information on fathers and other family members, including
any paternal half-siblings. Information on paternity is also difficult to obtain in fieldwork
[109]. CHDs are associated with maternal CHD[65], and even a small number of affected
women might affect our interpretation of the severe CHD outcome. Although we checked as
thoroughly as possible, data on maternal morbidities were limited by timeframes of databases
and, possibly, incomplete recording. We did not exclude women with: diabetes not prescribed
insulin, unmedicated epilepsy, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, sickle cell anae-
mia, maternal hypertension. BMI was poorly recorded in all databases, precluding exploration
of confounding by obesity[110].
Recreational drug use, heavy alcohol use and substance misuse are captured poorly in
clinical care, fieldwork and databases. These potential confounders were not available in the
Scandinavian databases. Only problems recorded by primary care professionals could be iden-
tified in Wales; this would not include casual users or regular users not reporting problems.
Depression may be under-reported in primary care records, due to inaccurate diagnosis by
primary care practitioners[111], fears of ‘labeling’ or stigmatizing[112], and, possibly, incom-
plete record transfer from secondary care. Accordingly, we acknowledge the risks of under-
ascertainment, and the limitations of taking the absence of any records as indicative of non-
exposure. Adjustment was limited by low numbers of exposed cases, incomplete recording of
smoking (Table 6 and Tables Aa-c, G in S1 Appendix) and, in Denmark, a higher prevalence
of missing data amongst cases (Tables Aa-c in S1 Appendix). However, in Wales, alternative
predictors were not identified for anomalies other than abdominal wall defects (Table F in S1
Appendix).
Analyses of all antidepressants and SSRIs excluding co-prescription of other antidepres-
sants could not include Denmark, and therefore are not directly comparable to the main
results.
The study’s size was sufficient (>312,000) to detect an association between SSRI exposure
(2.50%) with major anomalies (prevalence 2.68%, Table 1) greater than OR 1.2, with 80%
power and alpha 0.05, but >1,000,000 subjects would be needed to detect ORs of 1.1. For the
commonest anomaly, CHD (prevalence 0.9%) and the commonest SSRI (citalopram, 0.8%
exposure), there were sufficient subjects (>456,000) to detect an OR of 1.5 [113]. Higher pre-
scription rates in Wales gave more exposed pregnancies (and power) than previous cohorts
[14,21] benefitting from verified EUROCAT coding[15,22,33].
We acknowledge the hazards of multiple testing, without correction, but recognise the ten-
sions between umbrella terms, which can hide true signals between specific anomalies and
SSRIs and Congenital Anomalies

 specific medicines, and narrow categories or rare outcomes yielding numbers too small for sta-
tistical comparisons[114,115]. A priori hypotheses[9,27,31,35,51] were tested without statistical
adjustment, to limit misinterpretation (Table 3)[116]. Associations between individual agents
and anomalies offer signals for replication in independent data sets (Table C in S1 Appendix).
Our population-based cohort study yielded lower ORs than Wemakor et al’s [31] case-mal-
formed control study of 12 EUROCAT registries, suggesting that we have not over-estimated
harms, congruent with reports that estimates of adverse event rates are lower in cohort than
case-control studies[117].
Logical and biological inferences should be considered when interpreting these findings,
which are congruent with seven of the nine Bradford-Hill criteria of causation [118]: temporal
and dose-response relationships; consistency of effect size (ORs) for ‘all anomalies’ internally,
and with the literature[26,30,73]; biological plausibility; consideration of alternative explana-
tions (depression, SES, smoking); specificity to severe CHD; and coherence with extant theo-
ries of serotonergic transmission and vasoconstriction. However, neither we nor others offer
experimental evidence, and the associations, while persistent and clinically serious [60], repre-
sent small absolute risk differences (Table 3). Where partial overlap between our data and that
published by EUROCAT[31], the Danish 1995–2008[103], and Nordic authors 1996–2010[16]
occurs, findings are consistent. However, the last excluded stillbirths and TOPFAs, reducing
the prevalence of anomalies. We have avoided P values, but acknowledge the problems inher-
ent in dichotomizing data according to 95% confidence intervals where assignment is not ran-
domized and assumptions (for example on adherence) are unverifiable [119]: interpretation
and translation into clinical practice rest with readers.
Interpretation and care pathways
Our findings resonate with larger cohorts and meta-analyses[26],[30],[73], despite the risks of
attenuation of odds ratios, above. SSRI prescription in the 91 days either side of LMP was asso-
ciated with higher prevalence of anomalies and stillbirths: ~7 rather than ~6 adverse outcomes
per 200 exposed births. The heterogeneity in severe CHD may be attributable to diverse pre-
scription regimens, environmental factors or ill-defined contextual variables. The higher prev-
alence was most apparent in Denmark, where single prescriptions were unusual and high
doses relatively common, and absent in Norway, where single prescriptions were more com-
mon, high doses and paroxetine relatively rare, and escitalopram the most popular SSRI. The
UK formulary [120] notes the pro-arrhythmic potential of escitalopram and contra-indicates
breastfeeding, which may explain lower use in Wales.
Antidepressant use in pregnancy is determined by the balance between benefits to the
woman and harms to the foetus: there is no certainty that realisation of the fourth (reducing
child mortality) and fifth (improving maternal health) UN Millennium Development goals
[121] will always coincide. Congenital anomalies and stillbirths are not the only harms associ-
ated with antidepressants[122]. Prescribing decisions are informed by other possible harms
[73,123]: spontaneous abortion[29,124], low birth weight, prematurity, admission to neonatal
special care facilities [33,85–87,125], gestational hypertension, postpartum haemorrhage[126],
persistent pulmonary hypertension in neonates[88,120,127,128], concerns over delayed motor
development[129].
The uncertain clinical effectiveness of antidepressants in pregnancy[126,130] for mild or
moderate depression[131,132], treatment resistance in some 30% patients[78], contra-indica-
tion in mild depression [120], and wide variations in prescribing across Europe[3] underlie
recommendations to restrict pharmacotherapy in pregnancy to women with severe depression
[133–135] or adjust prescribing thresholds[73]. However, poor parental perinatal mental

 health can adversely affect childhood outcomes [136], while effects on perinatal outcomes are
modest [137], and more marked in developing countries [138]. Guidelines’ equivocation
places the onus on prescribers [139,140], despite constraints in primary care, including short
appointment times[141]. Withholding or withdrawing antidepressants from women with seri-
ous illness may worsen illness or induce withdrawal symptoms or relapse[133,142], and clini-
cians are mindful of the increased risk of harm, including suicide, in the 28 days following
discontinuation[143], but more evidence relating to those less seriously ill is needed. The
higher exposure rates in Wales, compared with Norway and Denmark, plus the low prevalence
of mental health diagnoses [66], may suggest that women in Wales suffering less severe depres-
sion are more likely to be prescribed SSRIs. These women may derive less benefit from antide-
pressants, whilst risking the same harms.
Implications
The clinical importance of stillbirth and major congenital anomalies, including severe CHD,
suggests that small increases in absolute risk might influence decisions on therapy and care
pathways at population level[144]. Examination of three Northern European population
cohorts consistently indicated an association between SSRIs and major anomalies, which
increased when stillbirths were included. Uniquely, the association identified with severe CHD
was supported by: a dose-response relationship, lower prevalence in those stopping SSRIs,
higher prevalence in those with >1 prescription, minimal confounding by SES, plus, in Wales,
no association with alternative exposures, including depression. Given the rarity of specific
congenital anomalies and ethical considerations, randomised trials with these outcomes may
never be undertaken. However, since risk estimates for adverse events are similar in trials and
observational studies[145], these findings have implications for practice.
Even if associations reported here are not necessarily causal, SSRI prescriptions can be iden-
tified in primary care records and offer convenient markers for increased vulnerability, more
easily ascertained and reliable than smoking status or recreational drug consumption
[109,146]. Balancing the number needed to harm, 192, with the severity of potential adverse
effects (stillbirth or major anomaly) [53], whilst minimising any iatrogenic harm [140] might
entail regarding records of SSRI prescriptions as indication to:
• Target all women contacting primary care for SSRI prescriptions, not just those identifying
themselves as planning pregnancy, since ~43% UK pregnancies are unplanned[147].
• Regard substance misuse or heavy drinking as possible indicators of high risk from SSRI pre-
scribing (6.3%).
• Expand pre-conception care to include: reviewing therapeutic regimens, particularly high
doses of SSRIs; reflecting that ~40% women discontinuing SSRIs after conception do not
restart within a year of childbirth [3], and cognitive behavioural therapy may be equally
effective[148]; prescribing folic acid, which may reduce the prevalence of CHD[149].
• Consider offering women prescribed SSRIs in pregnancy third trimester scans or alterna-
tive continuous monitoring technology to:
• take advantage of advances in monitoring and surgery in utero
• ensure appropriate levels of neonatal care are available at birth.
• Consider whether there is now sufficient evidence and clinical indication to offer a modi-
fied care pathway to include detailed ultrasound scans with views of the 4 cardiac cham-
bers, outflow tracts and aortic arch plus Doppler investigation of blood flow [150], even if

 not otherwise indicated. Ultrasound is not considered to be associated with risk, and
there are no reported harms [151], with follow up to age 15–16 [152]; some may consider
that the injunction “Do no harm” [140] might justify the additional clinical work, and any
additional anxiety for parents associated with clinically unimportant incidental findings.
