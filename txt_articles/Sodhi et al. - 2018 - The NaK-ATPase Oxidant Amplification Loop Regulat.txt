As aging involves oxidant injury, we examined the role of the recently described Na/K-ATPase oxidant 
amplification loop (NKAL). First, C57Bl6 old mice were given a western diet to stimulate oxidant injury 
or pNaKtide to antagonize the NKAL. The western diet accelerated functional and morphological 
evidence for aging whereas pNaKtide attenuated these changes. Next, human dermal fibroblasts 
(HDFs) were exposed to different types of oxidant stress in vitro each of which increased expression of 
senescence markers, cell-injury, and apoptosis as well as stimulated the NKAL. Further stimulation of 
the NKAL with ouabain augmented cellular senescence whereas treatment with pNaKtide attenuated 
it. Although N-Acetyl Cysteine and Vitamin E also ameliorated overall oxidant stress to a similar degree 
as pNaKtide, the pNaKtide produced protection against senescence that was substantially greater than 
that seen with either antioxidant. In particular, pNaKtide appeared to specifically ameliorate nuclear 
oxidant stress to a greater degree. These data demonstrate that the NKAL is intimately involved in the 
aging process and may serve as a target for anti-aging interventions.
Aging is characterized by a number of physiological changes including loss of cell division, oxidative stress, DNA 
damage, nuclear changes, and increased expression of senescence-associated genes1–5. From the phenotypic point 
of view, aging might be defined as the progressive age-related decline of physiological function caused by cell 
arrest (senescence) and/or programmed cell death (apoptosis)6,7. It has been known for some time that oxidant 
stress plays a central role in the aging process, and is causally involved in the injury to cellular proteins and 
DNA8–10. When reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation exceeds the detoxifying ability of the cell, the result-
ing oxidative stress induces damage, senescence, and apoptosis. It is the imbalance between ROS and antioxidant 
defense mechanisms11 that contribute to impaired physiological function, disease development, and ultimately, 
the limited life span of an organism12.
We recently reported that the Na/K-ATPase – Src – EGFR signaling pathway serves as a feed-forward ampli-
fication loop for oxidants (Na/K-ATPase oxidant amplification loop, NKAL)13–15. Na/K-ATPase can act as a spe-
cific receptor for cardiotonic steroids (CTS) and as a non-specific receptor for ROS, inducing conformational 
changes in Na/K-ATPase α
-1 subunit, which in turn, phosphorylates Src, followed by the transactivation of 
EGFR. This initiates a signaling cascade resulting in additional ROS generation. We further showed that this 
NKAL is involved in various disease models ranging from uremic cardiomyopathy to obesity13,14,16,17. Our group 
developed a peptide, pNaKtide, from the N domain of the Na/K-ATPase α
1 subunit. This peptide binds Src 
kinase; ultimately inhibiting the Na/K-ATPase feed forward amplification of ROS16,18–20. Based on these earlier 
observations, we hypothesized that the NKAL might play a role in the aging process and antagonism of this path-
way by pNaKtide might attenuate the aging process.

Effect of pNaKtide on body weight, tissue weight, energy expenditure, locomotor activity, and 
oxygen consumption in C57B16 aging mice. 
We evaluated the effects of Na/K-ATPase signaling and 
pNaKtide in vivo using a mouse model of aging and a western diet (WD) regimen to induce oxidative stress. Our

further increased in old mice fed a WD (Table 1). These increases were significantly decreased by pNaKtide treat-
ment (Table 1). There were no significant differences in any of these measures between young mice and young 
mice treated with pNaKtide.
There were no significant differences in heart weight between any of the groups (Table 1). Energy expendi-
ture was determined as heat production in kcal/kg/hr21. The results showed that there was a significant increase 
in energy expenditure in pNaKtide treated old mice fed a WD as compared to old mice fed a WD (Table 1). 
Locomotor activity was also measured based on the ambulatory count over a 24 hr period21. Old mice showed 
decreased activity as compared to young mice, and old mice fed a WD showed decreased activity as compared 
to young mice, old baseline, and old mice. Administration of pNaKtide to old mice significantly increased their 
levels of locomotor activity compared to old baseline and old mice. Administration of pNaKtide to old mice fed 
a WD significantly increased their levels of locomotor activity compared to old mice fed a WD (Table 1). Oxygen 
consumption was measured in terms of mL/kg/hr. The results showed that there was a significant increase in oxy-
gen consumption in pNaKtide treated old mice fed a WD as compared to old mice fed a WD (Table 1).
Effect of pNaKtide on adipocyte phenotype, senescence, and Na/K-ATPase signaling in C57Bl6 
aging mice. 
Adipose tissue dysfunction occurs with aging22,23. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of 
visceral fat tissues showed increased adipocyte size in adipose tissue of old mice with further increases in old mice 
fed a WD (Fig. 1A and B). Crown-like structures, representing an accumulation of macrophages around adipo-
cytes, were apparent in adipose tissues of old mice with further increases noted in old mice fed a WD (Fig. 1A). In 
both groups, these increases were significantly attenuated with pNaKtide treatment. The TUNEL assay demon-
strated that apoptosis was significantly increased in the adipose tissue of old mice and further increased in old 
mice fed a WD. These increases were also attenuated with pNaKtide treatment (Fig. 1C). The expression level of 
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ
) is upregulated in diet-induced obesity, indicative of 
adipocyte hypertrophy and physiologic dysregulation of adipose tissue24,25. Apolipoprotein J (ApoJ) and p21 are 
known to increase in stress-induced cellular senescence25,26. Our results showed that ApoJ, p21, and PPARγ
 levels 
were increased in the old mice and further increased in old mice fed a WD (Fig. 1D,E and F). The magnitudes of 
these increases were significantly decreased with pNaKtide treatment. Protein carbonylation is well-known indi-
cator of oxidative stress15. Old mice had demonstrable increases in protein carbonylation in adipose tissues, and 
these increases were amplified with a WD (Fig. S1A). The pSrc levels were also increased in the adipose tissues of 
old mice with further increases with a WD (Fig. S1B). Again, these changes were negated by treatment with pNa-
Ktide. Levels of TNFα
, a pro-inflammatory cytokine, and thiobarbituric reactive substances (TBARS), another 
marker of oxidative stress, increased significantly in old mice and old mice fed a WD as compared to the young 
mice (Fig. S1C and D). These increases were again negated by treatment with pNaKtide.
Effect of pNaKtide on heart senescence, apoptosis, and Na/K-ATPase signaling in C57Bl6 aging mice. 
 
Sirius red staining was performed to quantify fibrosis in heart tissues. Sirius red staining demonstrated a signif-
icant increase in fibrosis of the heart tissue in the old mice with further increases in old mice fed a WD (Fig. 2A 
and B). Treatment with pNaKtide decreased the fibrosis in both of these groups. H&E staining of cardiac tissues 
demonstrated remnants of degenerating myofibers in the old mice and old mice fed a WD (data not shown). 
Again, these changes were attenuated by pNaKtide treatment.
Aging resulted in cardiac hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction as assessed by echocardiographic methods, 
summarized in Table 2. Specifically, old mice and old mice fed a WD had increased left ventricular wall thick-
ness (anterior wall thickness (AWT), posterior wall thickness (PWT), relative wall thickness (RWT)), and left 
ventricular mass index (LVMI)). In addition, impaired function was noted in these groups with the myocar-
dial performance index (MPI). These changes were significantly attenuated by pNaKtide treatment (Table 2). A 
significant increase in fibronectin, p21, and ApoJ levels were seen in both the old mice and old mice fed a WD 
(Fig. 2C,D and E). The magnitudes of these increases were significantly decreased with pNaKtide treatment. 
The TUNEL assay demonstrated that apoptosis was significantly increased in the hearts of old mice and further 
increased in old mice fed a WD (Fig. 2F and G). These increases were attenuated with pNaKtide treatment. There

was significant increase in protein carbonylation in old mice with further increases in old mice fed a WD. These 
increases were attenuated with pNaKtide (Fig. S2A). TBARS levels followed a similar trend (Fig. S2B).
Effect of pNaKtide on H2O2-induced senescence in human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs). 
 
Administration of H2O2 results in oxidative stress and DNA damage, which can lead to senescence27,28. Dose 
concentration curves were generated to determine the optimal dose of pNaKtide, which is effective in attenuating 
senescence (Fig. S3A). Our results showed that H2O2 treated HDF exhibited morphological changes indicative 
of cellular senescence that included enlargement, flattening, and elongation of the cells along with decreased cell 
number, when viewed under light microscopy (Fig. S3A). We also noted that expression of senescence genes, 
ApoJ, p21, and fibronectin29 exhibited significant upregulation after subjection to H2O2 treatment compared to 
untreated, control cells (Fig. S3B, S3C, S3D). Treatment with 1 µM pNaKtide significantly attenuated this effect 
when administered to H2O2 treated cells. Elevated levels of beta-galactosidase (SA β
-Gal), senescence-associated 
marker30, and phosphorylated histone H2AX (γ
-H2AX), a marker of double-stranded DNA breaks31, were noted 
in the H2O2 group and these changes were also attenuated by pNaKtide (Fig. 3A and B). Using a TUNEL assay to 
detect levels of fragmented and degraded DNA32, we found that apoptosis levels were elevated in cells treated with 
H2O2, which was attenuated by pNaKtide treatment. Caspase-9 is an essential initiator caspase required for apop-
tosis signaling33. Caspase-9 activity was elevated in H2O2 treated cells and this was decreased by treatment with 
pNaKtide (Fig. 3C and D). No significant differences between the control group and the control group treated 
with pNaKtide were noted.
Effect of pNaKtide on the p53 senescence pathway and Na/K-ATPase signaling in H2O2-treated 
HDFs. 
Cell senescence can be induced and maintained through the p53 pathway34–36. The effects of oxida-
tive stress, such as double-strand breaks in DNA, trigger activation of ATM and CHK2, which then activates 
p537,26,37–39. Treatment of HDFs with H2O2 significantly increased levels of pATM, pCHK2, and p53 protein com-
pared with untreated controls. This effect was significantly attenuated following pNaKtide treatment (Fig. 3E,F 
and G). Further, the pNaKtide-treated group had significantly lower p21 mRNA expression compared with the

H2O2-treated group (Table 3). Ki-67 is a well-established marker of cell proliferation40,41. The H2O2-treated group 
had significantly lower expression of Ki-67 mRNA and expression levels were restored in the pNaKtide-treated 
group (Table 3). Further, mRNA levels of other senescence markers, including ApoJ, matrix metallopro-
teinase 9 (MMP9), fibronectin, and collagenase were measured. All four were significantly decreased in the 
pNaKtide-treated group compared with the H2O2-treated group (Table 3). Protein carbonylation increased in 
H2O2-treated cells, and this increase was negated by pNaKtide treatment (Fig. 3H). Treatment with pNaKtide also 
blocked Na/K-ATPase-regulated Src activation in H2O2-treated HDFs (Fig. 3I). Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 
release, a marker of cytotoxicity42, was increased in the H2O2-treated group, and this was attenuated by concom-
itant treatment with pNaKtide (Table 3).

Effect of anti-oxidants on H2O2-induced senescence in HDFs. 
NAC and Vitamin E are known anti-
oxidants, which have been shown to be effective in attenuating cellular senescence43–47. Dose concentration curves 
were generated to determine the optimal doses of NAC and Vitamin E, which were somewhat effective in atten-
uating senescence in our H2O2 model (Fig. 4A). Cells exposed to H2O2 and treated with 5 mM concentration of 
NAC or 50uM concentration of Vitamin E attenuated the morphological or biochemical changes of senescence, 
but less so than pNaKtide (Fig. 4A,C–E). However, the reductions in cellular oxidant stress as assessed by TBARS 
achieved with NAC and Vit E were virtually identical to that seen with pNaKtide (Fig. 4B).
Effect of pNaKtide on UV radiation-induced senescence in HDFs. 
HDFs were treated with UV radi-
ation, another mechanism for triggering oxidative-stress–mediated senescence48. Levels of SA β
-Gal and TBARS 
were significantly higher in the UV-treated group compared with the control group (Fig. S4A and B). These 
increases were attenuated in the pNaKtide-treated group. The mRNA expression levels of p21, ApoJ, MMP9, and 
fibronectin were all significantly higher in the UV-treated group, and these increases were negated when cells 
were also treated with pNaKtide (Fig. S4C, S4D, S4E, and S4F).
Effect of pNaKtide on ouabain-induced senescence in HDFs. 
Since H2O2-mediated ROS initi-
ated Na/K-ATPase signaling and induced senescence, we next studied whether ouabain, a specific receptor for 
Na/K-ATPase signaling activation, could also induce cellular senescence. A concentration curve was generated 
to determine the optimal dose of ouabain, and it was found that treatment with a 50 nM concentration signifi-
cantly exhibited morphological changes indicative of cellular senescence (Fig. S5A). Additionally, LDH release 
increased significantly in the ouabain-treated group compared with the control group (Fig. S6B). Our results 
showed a significant increase in levels of γ
-H2AX (Fig. S5C), and pATM, pCHK2, p53 protein (Fig. S6A,B and 
C) in the ouabain treated group that were attenuated with pNaKtide treatment. Also, pNaKtide decreased p21 
mRNA expression when administered with ouabain (Fig. S6D). Caspase 9 activity increased significantly in the 
ouabain-treated group; this was also significantly attenuated by concomitant treatment with pNaKtide (Fig. S5D). 
The ouabain treated group also had significantly decreased Ki-67 levels as compared to the control group. This 
decrease was negated with pNaKtide treatment (Fig. S6E). Ouabain, of course, increased the pSrc/Src ratio, and 
this was also significantly decreased by pNaKtide treatment (Fig. S6F).
Effect of glucose oxidase (GO) and pNaKtide on oxidative stress, cell proliferation, and apoptosis 
 
in HDFs. 
GO generates moderate amounts of H2O2 which results in a steady increase in intracellular ROS in 
HDFs49. Concentrations of GO ranging from 0 to 10 mU/ml were administered to HDFs. Our result showed that

TBARS level increased with increasing concentrations of GO (Fig. 5A). Treatment with pNaKtide attenuated this 
increase; however it is important to note that TBARS concentration in the pNaKtide treated cells was still demon-
strably elevated with the high concentrations of GO. To determine the role of Na/K-ATPase signaling in main-
taining cell function and proliferation, MTT and CyQUANT assays were performed. Based on the MTT assay, 1 
and 3 mU/ml of GO increased cell proliferation compared with control group, whereas 5 and 10 mU/ml of GO 
decreased cell count (Fig. 5B). Based on these observations, we hypothesized that some activation of the NKAL, 
demonstrated with 1 and 3 mU/ml GO may actually result in enhanced cell proliferation. Along these lines, we 
saw that concomitant treatment with pNaKtide allowed for enhanced cell proliferation in the groups exposed to 
5 and 10 mU/ml of GO. The CyQUANT assay showed that compared with controls, the number of cells increased 
with GO 1 mU/ml and GO 3 mU/ml respectively; whereas 5 and 10 mU/ml of GO decreased cell count (Fig. 5C). 
Our results further showed that pNaKtide treatment did not increase cell proliferation in the groups exposed to 
1, 3, and 5 mU/ml of GO. However, cell counts were increased in cells treated with 10 mU/ml GO with pNaKtide 
compared with 10 mU/ml GO alone. Based on caspase 9 activity, 5 and 10 mU/ml of GO increased apoptosis sig-
nificantly compared with the control group. Treatment with pNaKtide negated this effect (Fig. 5D). These results 
support the concept that oxidants at low concentrations can stimulate cell proliferation whereas at higher con-
centrations, cell apoptosis results50. Interestingly, pNaKtide not only decreased the net amount of oxidant stress 
as assessed by the accumulation of TBARS but had more profound effects on cell proliferation and apoptosis than 
one would anticipate from the antioxidant effect alone.
Effect of GO and pNaKtide on protein carbonylation in HDFs. 
Immunofluorescence of protein 
carbonylation using 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNP) showed that 3, 5, and 10 mU/ml of GO significantly 
increased evidence for carbonylation, more so in the nucleus, compared with the control group (Fig. 6A and B). 
Furthermore, treatment with pNaKtide significantly reduced the carbonylation levels, especially in the nucleus, 
compared with GO alone. Immunoblotting of whole cell lysates with anti-DNP antibody showed that 10 mU/
ml of GO significantly increased protein carbonylation compared with the control group (Fig. 6C). Conversely, 
this effect was negated when cells were treated with pNaKtide. Further, a double-staining immunofluorescence 
study was performed to determine the co-occurrence of protein carbonylation and DNA damage and fluorescent 
probes for DNP and γ
-H2AX were visualized with confocal microscopy (Fig. 6D). HDFs exposed to GO 10 mU/
ml concentration showed increased DNA damage along with increased intra-nuclear carbonylation when com-
pared to control showing a positive co-relation between protein carbonylation and DNA damage (Fig. 6E). These 
increases with GO were attenuated with concomitant pNaKtide treatment.
Discussion
We observed that the recently described NKAL14,15,21 regulates the aging process. We previously showed that 
a western diet induced Na/K-ATPase signaling and increased oxidative stress in mice14. We used this dietary 
approach to investigate the effects of age and oxidative stress in adipose tissue, and heart, which are both affected 
by the aging processes. In both of these organ systems, old mice and old mice fed a WD had evidence for oxidant 
injury, which was related to the stimulation or inhibition of the NKAL with the WD or pNaKtide, respectively. 
As in obesity, aging is frequently associated with an increased proportion of adipose tissue as well as increased 
concentrations of circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα
23. In our experiments, old mice had 
increased fat deposition along with large adipocytes and increased TNFα
 levels; these changes were accentuated 
in the old mice fed a WD. Aging of heart tissues is associated with impaired function detectable with echocar-
diography and fibrosis measurable with histology51. These changes were exacerbated by the WD and attenuated 
by pNaKtide treatment as well. Again, these changes in adipose tissues were negated with pNaKtide treatment.
HDFs treated with sub-lethal doses of H2O2, UV radiation, ouabain, and GO displayed a senescent phenotype 
that was attenuated when pNaKtide was added. Treatment of pNaKtide in HDFs exposed to H2O2 and ouabain, 
respectively, also reduced expression levels of numerous molecular markers of senescence, including pATM, 
pCHK2, p53, p21, ApoJ, fibronectin, γ
-H2AX, SA β
-Gal, collagenase, and MMP930,52–56. Inhibition of the NKAL 
with pNaKtide attenuated oxidation-induced senescence at both morphological and molecular levels, and these 
improvements were greater than that achieved by the anti-oxidants, N-Acetyl Cysteine and Vitamin E even 
though these latter antioxidants attenuated oxidant stress to virtually identical degrees as pNaKtide.

We also noted that both H2O2 and ouabain exposure increased levels of cell injury and apoptosis markers. 
Subsequent pNaKtide treatment decreased injury and apoptosis in the HDF cells as well. Perhaps even more 
interestingly, our oxidation titration experiments in HDF cells exposed to GO suggest that the Na/K-ATPase 
oxidant amplification loop preferentially “feeds” oxidants into specific intracellular locations, in particular the 
nucleus. We suggest that this nuclear oxidant stress effects DNA damage, which is the cornerstone of the aging 
process. We therefore emphasize that interference with the NKAL with pNaKtide achieves a greater anti-aging 
effect than would be achieved by simple anti-oxidant administration.
There were a number of limitations in this study. The most obvious is that human tissues were limited to that 
of an in vitro system, the cultured HDFs. In vivo experiments in the mouse allow for rapid study of processes that 
take decades in humans, but of course these processes therefore have inherent differences. While cultured cells 
are a good way to control molecular conditions in aging, this approach has obvious limitations. We would stress

however that with the in vitro systems, we were able to identify discordance between the anti-oxidant effects of 
pNaKtide and pNaKtide’s modulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis, both of which were out of proportion 
to the anti-oxidant effects. Ligand dependent Na/K-ATPase/Src signaling and transactivation of EGFR has been 
documented to activate downstream signaling cascades causing ROS generation57,58. Therefore, pharmacological 
alterations to EGFR may ameliorate cellular oxidative stress and senescence, which might mimic the effects of 
pNaKtide. Studies are required to investigate the extent of EGFR involvement in the process of aging and cellular 
senescence, allowing comparing the effectiveness of EGFR silencing with pNaKtide.
Several pharmacological interventions have been developed against aging in an effort to attenuate cellular 
senescence. These therapeutic drugs eliminate senescent cells by directly targeting the proliferative, apoptotic 
and cell survival signaling pathways59. The success of targeted anti-aging therapies have been based on a variety of 
signal cascades including senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP) modulation (e.g., with resveratrol, 
apinegin and wogonin), immuno-therapeutics (e.g., anti-IL1R) as well as induction of apoptosis (e.g., quercetin, 
navitoclax, dasatinib)60,61. In our study, we demonstrated that the Na/K-ATPase oxidant amplification loop plays 
a vital role in the aging process. Our peptide, pNaKtide, is a specific antagonist of this signaling pathway. The 
success of this strategy opens up a new approach to the aging process. In the future studies, we plan to compare 
the anti-aging effects of pNaKtide with other agents like those described above.
Our data clearly suggest that the NKAL is involved in the aging process and, if confirmed in human studies, 
might ultimately serve as a therapeutic target. If the pNaKtide can be safely used in humans, it might be possible 
to study the applicability of that specific agent to the problem of clinical aging.

a well known model of diet induced metabolic and redox imbalance62. WD contained 42% fat, 42.7% carbohy-
drate, and 15.2% protein yielding 4.5 KJ/g. Fructose was made at a concentration of 42 g/L, yielding 0.168 KJ/mL. 
 
The animals were randomly divided into 7 groups (8–15/group) as follows1: Young2, Old-Baseline3, Old4, 
Old + WD5, Young + pNaKtide6, Old + pNaKtide, and7 Old + WD + pNaKtide. The number of animals in each 
group was determined by power analysis following assumptions derived from our previous study with mice63, 
using a variance of 0.2 within the groups, power of 0.80, and alpha error of 0.05. Old baseline group (16 months) 
was sacrificed immediately and tissues were saved in liquid nitrogen until assayed. After 4 weeks of control or 
WD diet respectively, groups 5, 6 and 7 were injected with pNaKtide for 8 weeks (dissolved in saline and injected 
I.P. at a dose of 25-mg/kg-body weight every 7 days as previously described14). The body weight was measured 
every week. Young (4 months) and Old (19 months) mice were sacrificed, followed by heart and adipose tissue 
collection. The tissues were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and maintained at −
80 °C until assayed.
TBARS measurement in adipose and cardiac tissues and HDFs. 
Oxidative injury in HDFs, adipose 
tissue, and cardiac tissues were measured using a TBARS assay kit (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI) according 
to the manufacturer’s protocol21. Data were normalized to total protein and presented as micromoles per mil-
ligram of protein.
Histopathological examination of cardiac and adipose tissue. 
Heart and visceral fat samples from 
each group were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, dehydrated, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned. Formalin-fixed, 
paraffin-embedded sections were cut (6 µm thick) and mounted on glass slides. The sections were deparaffinized 
in xylene. Sections of heart and visceral fat were stained with H&E. Sirius red staining was performed on sections 
of heart tissue for histological analysis of fibrosis. Preparation, fixation, and data analysis of cardiac and adipose 
tissue was conducted as previously described64.
Transthoracic Echocardiography. 
Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) was performed 24 hours prior 
to sacrifice as described previously13. The following cardiac characteristics were calculated from the data: myo-

body weight (g)13.
Experimental design for in vitro experiments. 
Primary HDFs were obtained from ATCC (PCS-201-
012) and cultured in fibroblast basal media (PCS-201-030) supplemented with low serum growth kit (PCS-201-
041). Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator and medium was replaced every 48 h. At 80% 
confluence, the cells were detached using trypsin and split in a 1:3 ratio. HDF cells were plated at a density of 
10,000 cells/cm2 for subsequent experiments.
Effect of H2O2, ouabain, UV radiation, GO treatment, NAC, and Vitamin E (α
-tocopherol) on 
cellular senescence. 
After 24 hours of plating, the cells were treated with 200 µM H2O2 for 2 hours. After 
2 hours, they were briefly rinsed with PBS and replaced with normal media with or without pNaKtide at different 
concentrations ranging from 0.5 µM to 4 µM. Following the dose response experiments, the subsequent treat-
ment with pNaKtide was done at a concentration of 1 µM for 72 hours. For ouabain treatment, after 24 hours of 
plating, the HDFs were treated with ouabain at different concentrations ranging from 1 nM to 100 nM. Following 
the dose response experiments, the subsequent treatment with ouabain was done at a concentration of 50 nM 
with and without 1 µM of pNaKtide for 72 hours. Similarly for UV radiation treatment, after 24 hours of plating, 
the HDFs were exposed with UV radiation (KERNEL KN-4003 BL) at a distance of 30 cm to the cells through 
a thin layer of phosphate buffer saline pH 7.4 at room temperature. The cells were treated twice daily for 5 days 
with UVB at 311 nm for duration of 2 minutes at a dose of 2.5 J/cm2. After every radiation, PBS was replaced with 
normal media with or without pNaKtide at 1 µM concentration. For the GO experiments, HDF cells were plated 
24 hours prior to exposure with an increasing dose of GO (Sigma G-2133) ranging from 1, 3, 5 and 10 mU/ml for 
72 hours treated with or without 1 µM pNaKtide. For the treatment with NAC, the HDFs were treated at different 
concentrations ranging from 1 mM, 5 mM and 10 mM for 72 hours, to generate a dose concentration curve. The 
subsequent treatment with NAC was done at a concentration of 5 mM. For Vit E treatment, the HDFs were plated 
for 24 hours and then treated with α
-tocopherol at different concentrations ranging from 25 µM to 100 µM for 
72 hours. Following the dose response experiments, the subsequent treatment with α
-tocopherol was done at a 
concentration of 50 µM.
Cell viability test by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay. 
An LDH viability assay kit (Cayman, US) 
was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol. HDFs were plated in 96-well plates, and cultured for 
24 hours. In the first set of experiments, cells were treated with H2O2 with or without subsequent pNaKtide treat-
ment as described above. In the second set of experiments, HDFs were exposed to ouabain with or without sub-
sequent pNaKtide treatment as described above. The percentage of LDH release for each sample was normalized 
to the absorbance of samples treated with 0.5% Triton X-100.

Senescence-associated β
-galactosidase (SA- β
-gal) activity. 
HDFs were plated in a 6-well plate and 
exposed to H2O2 or UV radiation with or without subsequent pNaKtide treatment as described above. SA-β
-gal 
activity was detected using a Senescence β
-Galactosidase Staining kit (Cell signaling Technology #9860) accord-
ing to the manufacturer’s protocol. Cells were viewed using light microscopy, and the percentage of cells with 
SA-β

by 100.
γ
-H2AX immuno-fluorescent staining for DNA Damage. 
DNA damage was measured in HDFs based 
on immunofluorescent staining of γ
-H2AX. Cells were grown in a six-well plate on coverslips pretreated with 
poly-lysine. Following exposure to H2O2 or ouabain with or without subsequent pNaKtide treatment as described 
above, cells were washed with PBS and fixed with cold 1:1 methanol:acetone. Cells were permeabilized with two 
washes of 0.025% Triton in PBS. Cells were blocked using 1% BSA in PBS for 30 minutes. The cells were incubated 
overnight at 4 °C with primary antibody, Anti- γ
-H2AX antibody (phospho S139; diluted 1:100 in 1% BSA in 
PBS). Slides were washed in 0.025% Triton in PBS, and the secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 488 diluted 1:1000 
in 1% BSA in PBS) was incubated in the dark at room temperature for 1 hour. Cells were washed three times with 
PBS. Cells were mounted and counterstained with 50 mg/ml DAPI. Images were collected using a digital inverted 
microscope that spanned the entire area of the cells; the percentage of γ
-H2AX-positive cells was calculated from 
the number of γ
-H2AX-positive cells divided by total number of cells multiplied by 100.
MTT and CyQuant assays for cell proliferation. 
HDFs were plated in 96-well plates and exposed to GO 
with or without subsequent pNaKtide treatment as described above. A Vybrant MTT Cell Proliferation Assay 
Kit (V-13154, Invitrogen) was used according to the manufacturer’s protocol14. CyQUANT Cell Proliferation 
Assay Kit (C7026, Invitrogen) was used for cell count according to the manufacture’s protocol. Fluorescence was 
measured at excitation/emission wavelengths of 480/520 nm (Spectramax i3x). Fluorescence measurements were 
converted to cell number based on a standard curve with an r2 >0.99.
Measurement of caspase-9 activity. 
In vitro analysis of caspase 9 activity in HDFs was performed using 
the Caspase 9 Assay Kit (ab65608, Abcam, US) according to the manufacture’s protocol. Caspase 9 activity was 
measured based on the absorbance at 400–405 nm, collected using a Spectramax i3x. Data were compared with 
the absorbance of control samples.
TUNEL assay for DNA damage detection. 
DNA double-strand breaks were detected in HDFs and frozen 
mouse tissues, (heart and adipose tissue) using the Click-iT® Plus TUNEL Assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., 
US) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Specimens were then mounted using VECTASHIELD® mounting 
medium and counterstained with 50 mg/ml DAPI. Images were collected using a digital inverted microscope 
that spanned the entire area of the cells and tissues on the cover slip. The percentage of TUNEL-positive cells was 
calculated based on the number of positively stained cells divided by the total number of cells multiplied by 100.
DNP assay for protein carbonylation detection. 
A dinitrophenol (DNP) assay was conducted on 
HDFs exposed to various concentrations of GO (1, 3, 5, and 10 mU/ml) with or without subsequent pNaKtide 
treatment. Cells were fixed in methacarn, rinsed with PBS, and incubated with 100 μ
l DNPH (1 mg/ml in 2 N 
HCl) for 30 min at room temperature. The sections were blocked for 1 hour with 10% normal horse serum, 0.2% 
Triton X-100 in PBS. Cells were incubated with primary antibody (rabbit anti-DNP diluted 1:500 in 0.2% Triton 
X-100 in PBS) overnight at 4 °C. Cells were washed with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS then incubated with second-
ary antibody (donkey anti-rabbit conjugated to green-fluorescent Alexa Fluor 488 dye) for 3 hours. Slides were 
washed with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS and rinsed with deionized H2O. Coverslips were mounted to slides with 
VECTASHIELD® mounting medium containing DAPI66–68. DNP fluorescence intensity was visualized using an 
EVOS portable microscope with an excitation/emission wavelength of 470/525 nm. Digital photographs of five 
randomly selected regions of each slide were collected. Image analysis was performed using ImageJ to measure 
the mean optical density of each cell. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 7.02 (GraphPad 
Software, Inc.). DNP fluorescence was further visualized with a Leica SP5 TCSII with Coherent Chameleon mul-
tiphoton. Vision II (IR) laser confocal microscope at 100x laser power and images taken using 100x objective 
power.
DNP and γ
-H2AX double immuno-fluorescent staining. 
For the in situ detection of DNA damage and 
nuclear carbonylation a double staining immunofluorescence assay was performed and visualized using confocal 
microscopy. Cells were treated, fixed, and permeabilized as described above. Cells were then incubated with 100 μ
l 
DNPH for 30 min at RT. The cells were then blocked for 1 hour with 10% normal goat serum, 0.2% Triton X-100 
in PBS. Cells were incubated with primary antibodies, rabbit anti-DNP (Sigma-Aldrich), diluted 1:500 in 0.2% 
Triton X-100 in PBS and mouse anti-γ
H2AX antibody (Molecular Probes, Inc), simultaneously overnight at 4 °C. 
The following day, goat anti-rabbit Alexa Flour® 488 IgG and goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor® 568 IgG H&L were 
applied for detection of the primary rabbit and mouse antibodies, respectively. Coverslips were mounted to slides 
with VECTASHIELD® mounting medium containing DAPI. DNP and γ
-H2A.X double immuno-fluorescence 
staining were visualized with a Leica SP5 TCSII with Coherent Chameleon multiphoton (MP) Vision II (IR) laser 
confocal microscope and images taken under oil at 100x objective power. Image analysis was performed using 
ImageJ to measure the expression of DNP mean optical density and to calculate the number of γ

Western blot analysis. 
HDFs were pulverized with liquid nitrogen and placed in a homogenization buffer. 
Homogenates were centrifuged, the supernatant isolated, and immunoblotting was performed as previously 
reported64,69. The supernatant was used for the determination of p5370, pATM/ATM71, and pCHK2/CHK272; and 
β
 actin was used to ensure adequate sample loading for all western blots.
Measurement of c-Src phosphorylation and protein carbonylation. 
Whole cell lysates from HDFs, 
visceral fat and cardiac tissues were prepared with NP-40 buffer and activation of c-Src was determined as 
described previously15,73. Western blotting for protein carbonylation was done on whole-cell lysates from HDFs, 
adipose and cardiac tissues as described previously73. The signal density values of control samples were normal-

RNA extraction and real-time PCR. 
Total RNA was extracted from HDFs, adipose, and heart tissues 
using RNeasy Protect Mini kit (QIAGEN, Maryland, USA) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Total RNA 
(1 μ
g) was transcribed into cDNA using GeneAmp kit (Applied Biosystems, Branchburg, NJ, USA) reverse tran-
scription reagents. Total RNA was analyzed by a quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction. Real-time 
PCR was performed using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix on a 7500 HT Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied 
Biosystems). Specific primers used were p21, ApoJ, fibronectin, MMP9, collagenase, ki67, and GADPH. Each 
reaction was performed in triplicate. The comparative threshold cycle3 method was used to calculate the fold 
amplification as specified by the manufacturer. Based on the literature review, GAPDH was identified as a suitable 
housekeeping gene for our aging model due to less intergroup variation74,75. However, we performed RT-PCR 
analysis on two well-established housekeeping genes (HPRT and β
-Actin) apart from GAPDH, for validation of 
a suitable internal control gene in our aging study. Our results demonstrated that GAPDH was a more consistent 
control than the other tested housekeeping genes in the adipose and heart tissue of C57Bl6 mice (Fig. S7). All 
experimental samples were normalized using GAPDH as an internal control.
Statistical analyses. 
The plots used were combination of scatter and boxplots. Scatter plots simply show the 
data points. The boxplot compactly displays the distribution of a continuous variable. It visualizes five summary 
statistics (the median, two hinges and two whiskers), and all “outlying” points individually76. The boxplot was 
defined by:
Notchlower: lower edge of notch = median −
 1.58 ∗
 interquartile range77/sqrt78
Middle median: 50% quantile
Notchupper: upper edge of notch = median + 1.58 ∗
 IQR/sqrt(n)
Lower hinge is the 25th percentile
Upper hinge is the 75th percentile
Data were analyzed and presented with the statistical program R using the packages ggplot2 and doBy. 
Multiple groups of parametric data (passed Shapiro-Wilk normality test) were compared with one way analy-
sis of variance (ANOVA) and individual group means compared with an unpaired t-test employing the Holm 
correction for multiple comparisons. Nonparametric data were analyzed with the Wilcoxon rank sum test, also 
employing the Holm correction for multiple comparisons. All data comparisons are presented at the NS, p < 0.05 
and p < 0.01 levels.
