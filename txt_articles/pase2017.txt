Abstract
Introduction: Excess sugar consumption has been linked with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology
in animal models.
Methods: We examined the cross-sectional association of sugary beverage consumption with
neuropsychological (N 5 4276) and magnetic resonance imaging (N 5 3846) markers of preclinical
Alzheimer’s disease and vascular brain injury (VBI) in the community-based Framingham Heart
Study. Intake of sugary beverages was estimated using a food frequency questionnaire.
Results: Relative to consuming less than one sugary beverage per day, higher intake of sugary bev-
erages
was
associated
with
lower

was associated with lower total brain volume, hippocampal volume, and poorer episodic memory (all
P ,.05). Sugary beverage intakewas not associated with VBI in a consistent manner across outcomes.
Discussion: Higher intake of sugary beverages was associated cross-sectionally with markers of pre-
clinical AD.

1. Background
Sugar consumption is excessive in Western society [1],
contributing to the burden of cardiometabolic disease
[2,3]. Consumption of sugary beverages, including sugar-
sweetened soft drinks, fruit drinks with added sugar, and
100% fruit juice, are major contributors to excess sugar
intake [1]. Studies in animal models suggest that excess
sugar intake, including from sugary beverages, leads to
the development of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology
[4–7]. However, little is known about the long-term effect
of sugary beverage intake on the human brain. Examining
intake of sugary beverages provides a proxy for excess die-
tary intake of sugar. Using detailed neuropsychological as-
sessments and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),
we examined the cross-sectional association between sugary
beverage consumption and phenotypes of preclinical AD

 and vascular brain injury in the Framingham Heart Study
(FHS)—a large, community-based, prospective cohort study
from Massachusetts, USA. We hypothesized that higher con-
sumption of sugary beverages would be associated with
greater evidence of both subclinical vascular brain injury
and preclinical AD.
2. Methods
The FHS commenced in 1948 with the aim to identify
factors that contribute to cardiovascular disease [8]. At
enrollment,
the
Original
cohort
comprised
5209
community-dwelling participants who did not yet have overt
signs of cardiovascular disease. Surviving participants
continue to be examined approximately every 2 years. In
1971, following a need to study younger adults, the children
of the Original cohort and their spouses were invited to form
the Offspring cohort [9]. The Offspring cohort enrolled 5124
participants who have been studied across nine quadrennial
examination cycles. In 2002, a subset of the grandchildren of
the Original cohort (the children of the Offspring cohort)
was enrolled into the Third Generation cohort [10]. This
cohort comprised 4095 participants at the initial examina-
tion and has now been studied twice, with a third examina-
tion
cycle
currently
underway.
All
cohorts
are
observational with information collected on a wide variety
of demographic, medical, and lifestyle indicators. Partici-
pants are also under constant surveillance for incident events
such as myocardial infarction, stroke, and dementia. For the
present study, we examined food frequency questionnaire
(FFQ) data collected during examination cycle 7 (1998–
2001) for the Offspring cohort and during examination cycle
2 (2008–2011) for the Third Generation cohort. We excluded
persons with prevalent dementia, stroke, or other significant
neurological disease, those younger than 30 years of age, and
participants who reported improbably high or low total en-
ergy intakes, suggesting that they had not filled out the
FFQ accurately. A comparison of participants included in
analysis versus excluded because of prevalent stroke, de-
mentia, or other neurological disease can be seen in
Supplemental Table 1.
Participants underwent neuropsychological assessment
and a brain MRI an average of 2 years (standard deviation
[SD] 5 1) from the examination cycle at which the FFQ
was administered; most participants completed cognitive
assessment and brain MRI on the same day (98%). The study
flow diagram is presented in Fig. 1. There were 4276 and
3846 participants available for analysis of the neuropsycho-
logical and MRI outcomes, respectively. All participants
provided written informed consent, and the study was
approved by the institutional review board and Boston Uni-
versity Medical Center.

 measure dietary intake over the past year and has been vali-
dated extensively [11–13]. Participants were asked how
often they consumed one glass, bottle, or can of each
sugary beverage item, on average, across the previous
year. Each item was scored according to nine responses
spanning from “never or almost never” to “61 per day.”
Participants were presented with three items on sugar-
sweetened soft drink (“Coke, Pepsi, or other cola with
sugar,” “caffeine-free Coke, Pepsi, or other cola with sugar,”
and “other carbonated beverages with sugar”), four items on
fruit juice (“apple juice,” “orange juice,” “grapefruit juice,”
and “other juice”), one item on sugar-sweetened fruit drinks
and three items on diet soft drink (“low-calorie cola with
caffeine,” “low-calorie caffeine-free cola,” and “other low-
calorie beverages”).
We summed the individual items to create exposure vari-
ables reflecting intake of (I) total sugary beverages
(excluding diet soft drinks), (II) fruit juice, (III) sugar-
sweetened soft drinks (all sugary beverages excluding diet
soft drink, fruit juice, and fruit drinks), and (IV) diet soft
drinks. For each of the four exposure variables, participant
responses were aggregated and new intake categories were
created ensuring an adequate number of participants in
each intake group for each variable. These new intake cate-
gories were based on the distribution of each variable. Total
sugary beverage consumption was examined as a three-level
variable: ,1/day (reference), 1–2/day, and .2/day; fruit
juice intake was categorized as a dichotomous variable:
,1/day (reference) and �1/day. Sugar-sweetened soft drink
intake was examined as a three-level variable: 0/week (refer-
ence), up to 3/week, and .3/week. Diet soft drink was also
examined as a three-level variable: 0/week (reference), up to
6/week, and �1/day. Intake of sugary beverages using the
FFQ has been compared against dietary records, with corre-
lation coefficients ranging from 0.84 for cola and 0.74 to
0.76 for fruit juice [14,15]. Moreover, intake of sugary
beverages ascertained via the FFQ is reliable when
measurements
are
repeated
after
12
months,
with
correlation coefficients ranging from 0.85 for cola and
0.86 for fruit juice [14,15].
2.2. Structural brain MRI
Total brain volume and hippocampal volume are sensitive
to early neurodegeneration [16] and were measured as
markers of preclinical AD. Silent brain infarcts and white-
matter hyperintensity volume (WMHV) are indicative of ce-
rebral small vessel disease [17] and were measured as sub-
clinical markers of vascular brain injury. For the Offspring
study participants, we used a Siemens 1-Tesla or 1.5-Tesla
field strength machine with a T2-weighted double spin-
echo (DSE) coronal imaging sequence in contiguous slices
of 4 mm. For the Third Generation participants, we used a
1.5-Tesla Siemens Avanto scanner with three-dimensional
T1-weighted coronal spoiled gradient-recalled echo acquisi-
tion and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR)
sequences. Total brain volume, hippocampal volume, and
WMHV were calculated relative to total cranial volume to
adjust for differences in head size. Given that intracranial
volume signifies the largest brain size achieved during life,
total brain volume provides an indicator of global brain atro-
phy. Hippocampal volume was calculated using a semiauto-
matic multiatlas segmentation algorithm [18]. The methods
used to segment WMHV have been described previously
[19]. We harmonized differences in WMHV between the
DSE and FLAIR sequences by applying formulae developed
from statistical modeling. WMHV was first expressed as a
percent of total cranial volume and log transformed to
normalize
its
distribution.
The
resulting
variable,
logWMHV-DSE,
was
converted
to
predicted
FLAIR
logWMHV using simple linear conversion models within
5-year age bins. Silent brain infarcts were counted manually
in accordance with the STRIVE criteria [17]. Comprehen-
sive details of the imaging methodology, including intrarater
reliabilities, are published elsewhere [19–22]. Scans were
read blinded to dietary intake scores.
2.3. Neuropsychological testing
Subtle deficits in episodic (verbal) memory can precede
the clinical diagnosis of AD dementia by up to a decade
[23] and are useful in identifying persons at the highest
risk of developing clinical AD [24]. We examined episodic
memory, using the tests of Logical Memory Immediate
and Delayed from the Wechsler Memory Scales, as markers
of preclinical AD. Based on our extensive past work relating
vascular risk factors to cognitive function [25,26], we
included tasks of Trail Making B minus A (processing
speed and executive function), Similarities (verbal abstract
reasoning) from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale and
Visual Reproductions Delayed (visual memory) from the
Wechsler Memory Scales as markers of vascular cognitive
impairment.
Values
of
Trails
B-A
were
natural
logarithmically transformed to restore normality and then
the mathematical sign was reversed, such that higher
scores on all tasks indicate superior performance. All
neuropsychological tests have adequate reliability and
construct
validity
[27,28].
Further
details
of
the
neuropsychological protocol can be seen elsewhere [28].
2.4. Statistical analysis
Statistical models were estimated using SAS Software
(SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). We used separate multivari-
able linear (for continuous measures) and logistic (for binary
outcomes) regression models to examine the associations
between the four dietary exposure variables and the MRI
and neuropsychological outcomes. Missing data were
excluded from analysis. All models included adjustments
for age, sex, total caloric intake, and the time interval be-
tween completion of the FFQ and the measurement of the
imaging/neuropsychological
outcomes.

 involving the neuropsychological outcomes were further
adjusted for education, whereas all models involving the
MRI outcomes were further adjusted for age squared given
that the association between age and brain volume is
nonlinear [19]. A second statistical model included addi-
tional adjustments for systolic blood pressure, treatment of
hypertension, current smoking status, prevalent cardiovascu-
lar disease, atrial fibrillation, left ventricular hypertrophy, to-
tal
cholesterol,
high-density
lipoprotein
cholesterol,
prevalent diabetes mellitus, depressive symptoms (Center
for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale scores �16)
and waist-to-hip ratio. A third statistical model included
the covariates outlined in model one plus intake of saturated
fat, trans-fat, and dietary fiber and self-reported physical ac-
tivity. We performed a sensitivity analysis by repeating sta-
tistical analyses (for model 1) after excluding persons with
prevalent diabetes or cardiovascular disease. We also per-
formed a sensitivity analysis by adjusting for fasting blood
glucose levels in model 2 in place of diabetes status. To pro-
vide some clinical context to our results, we expressed some
of our main findings in terms of years of brain aging. For this
purpose, we regressed each outcome score on age and
compared differences in means attributable to the different
categories of sugary beverage intake. We considered results
statistically significant if a two-sided P , .05.
3. Results
3.1. Cohort demographics
The clinical characteristics of our study sample are dis-
played in Table 1. Across the sample, the mean total caloric
intake was 1942 calories (SD 5 670) per day, which is
similar to other US cohorts of comparable ages [29]. Total
caloric intake and saturated fat, but not trans-fat, tended to
be higher with increasing intake of sugary beverages. Total
sugary beverages were consumed less than once per day,
once to twice per day, and greater than twice per day by
2395 (56%), 1239 (29%), and 641 (15%) participants,
respectively. Fruit juice was consumed one or more times
per day by 1330 (31%) participants. Most participants re-
ported
consuming
no
sugar-sweetened
soft
drinks
(n 5 2326, 54%), with 1359 (32%) participants consuming
sugar-sweetened soft drinks up to 3 times per week, and
588 (14%) participants consuming sugar-sweetened soft
drinks greater than three times per week. Diet soft drinks

 were consumed more regularly than sugar-sweetened soft
drinks, with 2081 (49%), 1495 (35%), and 698 (16%) partic-
ipants consuming no diet soft drinks, up to six per week, and
one or more per day, respectively. Supplemental Table 2
displays the unadjusted values of the outcome measures,
stratified by total sugary beverage intake.
3.2. Sugar-sweetened beverage consumption and markers
of preclinical AD
Greater consumption of total sugary beverages was asso-
ciated with lower total brain volume and lower scores on
Logical Memory Immediate and Delayed Recall (Table 2).
There was also a borderline statistically significant associa-
tion between the highest intake of total sugary beverages and
lower hippocampal volume. Adjusted least square means
and standard errors are displayed in Fig. 2 (adjusted for
model 1 covariates). Relative to no intake, the difference
in total brain volume associated with consuming 1–2 or
greater than 2 sugary beverages per day was equivalent to
1.6 and 2.0 years of brain aging, respectively. Relative to
no intake, the difference in Logical Memory Delayed Recall
scores associated with consuming 1–2 or greater than 2 sug-
ary beverages per day was equivalent to 5.8 and 11.0 years of
brain aging, respectively.
One or more servings per day of fruit juice were associ-
ated with lower total brain volume, hippocampal volume,
and poorer Immediate and Delayed Logical Memory scores.
The difference in total brain volume and Logical Memory
Delayed scores associated with daily fruit juice intake was
equivalent to 1.5 and 3.5 years of brain aging, respectively.
Relative to no intake, consuming more than three sugar-
sweetened soft drinks per week was associated with lower
total brain volume and lower Logical Memory Immediate
scores, with differences equivalent to 2.6 (for total brain vol-
ume) and 13.0 (for Logical Memory Immediate) years of
brain aging, when comparing the highest intake group to
the reference group. However, the association between
sugar-sweetened soft drinks and total brain volume was no
longer significant after adjustment for other dietary factors
and physical activity (model 3).
3.3. Consumption of sugary beverages and vascular brain
injury
Consuming more than two sugary beverages per day or
more than three sugary soft drinks per week was associated
with greater WMHV in models 1 and 2 although not model 3
(Table 3). There was also a borderline statistically significant
association between greater consumption of soft drinks with
sugar and poorer performance on the test of similarities.
3.4. Consumption of diet soft drink, preclinical AD, and
vascular brain injury
Higher diet soft drink intake was associated with smaller
total brain volume and poorer performance on the test of
similarities (Supplemental Tables 3 and 4). There were no
other associations between diet soft drink intake and the out-
comes evaluated.
3.5. Sensitivity analysis
Excluding 540 persons from analyses of the neuropsy-
chological outcomes and 463 persons from analyses of the
MRI outcomes (due to prevalent diabetes or cardiovascular
disease) did not change the observed pattern of results
(data not shown). Adjusting for fasting blood glucose levels
in place of prevalent diabetes status (in model 2) did not
change the significance or direction of the reported results
for any of the AD markers, with the exception that
consuming more than two sugary beverages per day was
associated
with
smaller
hippocampal
volume
(b
6
SE 5 0.005 6 0.002, P 5 .04). After adjustment for fasting
blood glucose, consuming more than two sugary beverages
per day was no longer associated with WMHV (b 6
SE 5 0.05 6 0.07, P 5 .48).
4. Discussion
In our cross-sectional analysis of a large community-
based sample, we observed that higher consumption of
sugary beverages was associated with smaller total brain vol-
ume, poorer episodic memory, and smaller hippocampal
volume (for higher fruit juice intake), a pattern of findings
consistent with preclinical AD. These findings were striking
given that they were evident in a middle-aged sample and
were observed even after statistical adjustment for numerous
confounding factors such as prevalent diabetes, total caloric
intake, and physical activity. The magnitudes of the associ-
ations observed were the equivalent of 1.5–2.6 years of brain
aging for total brain volume and 3.5–13 years of brain aging
for episodic memory.
Excess sugary beverage intake is known to be associated
with cardiovascular disease [2,3], which, in turn, is
associated with vascular brain injury [30]. Although this
suggests a possible link between sugary beverage consump-
tion and vascular brain injury, we observed more striking as-
sociations between sugary beverage intake and markers of
preclinical AD. These results add to a growing body of pre-
clinical research suggesting that high sugar intake is associ-
ated with the correlates of AD in mice. Research using mice
highly predisposed to developing AD pathology demon-
strated that high sucrose intake increased Ab aggregation
and tau phosphorylation via signaling of the mammalian
target of rapamycin [4], a protein that regulates cell prolifer-
ation and survival as well as energy homeostasis. Similarly, a
study using a transgenic mouse model of AD demonstrated
that the long-term consumption of sucrose-sweetened water,
relative to control water, led to poorer memory and a near
three-fold increase in Ab aggregation [7]. Also in animal
models, high fat refined sugar diets increase Ab aggregation
and tau phosphorylation [5], hippocampal atrophy [6], and

 reduce levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)
[6,31],
a
molecular
correlate
of
preserved
synaptic
integrity, and improved neuronal survival [32], leading to
impaired memory performance and reduced synaptic plas-
ticity within the hippocampus [6,31]. Our previous work
demonstrated that each SD increment in BDNF was
associated with a 33% lower risk of AD dementia [33], sug-
gesting that BDNF may partly mediate the association be-
tween high fat refined sugar diets and AD pathology.
In humans, the emerging pattern of results is consistent
with the aforementioned preclinical work. In a sample of
737 middle-aged community-dwelling participants without
diabetes, the Boston Puerto Rican Health Study reported
that higher total sugar intake was cross-sectionally associ-
ated with an AD-like pattern of poorer verbal memory and
phonemic fluency, whereas domains of cognition typically
associated with vascular cognitive impairment, such as exec-
utive function and attention, were spared [34]. In a sample of
141 adults, impaired glucose tolerance and chronically
elevated blood glucose levels were linked to poor memory,
with results partially mediated by changes in hippocampal
volume and microstructure [35]. By combining MRI and
neuropsychological outcomes in a large, dementia-free com-
munity-dwelling cohort, our results provide further evidence
that sugary beverage consumption is associated with
markers of preclinical AD in humans. These findings are
highly relevant given that AD is one of the largest growing
disease burdens facing our aging population [36].
Excess consumption of sugar throughout the Western
world has prompted action and debate from various Govern-
ments on how to lower sugar intake at the population level.
In the United States, newly released dietary guidelines
advise that adults should consume less than 10% of calories
from added sugar [37]. In Britain, the Government recently
announced a forthcoming sugar tax on soft drinks. Accord-
ing to the US National Nutrient Database, cola contains
approximately 9 g of sugar/100 g, and unsweetened apple
juice contains nearly 10 g of sugar/100 g [38]. Although
soft drinks are not celebrated for their health benefits, fruit
juices are often touted as a healthy alternative [39]. In one
survey, the general public overestimated the sugar content
of soft drinks but underestimated the sugar content of fruit
juices by an average of 48% [40]. Even without added sugar,
100% fruit juice contains the fructose from multiple portions
of fruit but with negligible fiber content. Worryingly, the
average 100% fruit juice marketed to children contains
more than a day recommended sugar allowance per
200 mL serving [39]. Our findings demonstrate that daily

 consumption of total sugary beverages and fruit juice were
both linked to markers of preclinical AD. Diet soft drink
was also associated with lower total brain volume. However,
it is unclear whether the association between diet soft drinks
and brain volume is mediated by concomitant higher intake
of sugary beverages either at present or in the past.
The main strength of our study was the use of a large and
well-characterized community-based sample free of clinical
stroke and dementia. Limitations of our study include the
observational and cross-sectional nature of the study, which
precludes conclusions about causality and the temporal asso-
ciations between sugary beverage intake, brain atrophy, and
cognitive decline. Second, ethnic minorities were not well
represented in our sample, limiting the generalizability of
our results to nonwhite populations. Third, sugary beverage
intake was quantified using a self-report FFQ, which may be
subject to recall bias. However, sugary beverage intake esti-
mated using our FFQ has been validated previously against
dietary records [14,15]. Our FFQ also did not differentiate
between fruit juice with and without added sugar, although
both contain high amounts of fructose. Regarding the
outcomes evaluated, we did not implement positron
emission tomography to characterize the burden of Ab and
tau pathology in the brain, which would help further
clarify the association between sugary beverage intake and
AD pathology. Finally, we did not adjust for multiple
statistical testing, and we cannot rule out the possibility
that some of the findings are due to chance.
In our cross-sectional observations in a large community-
based sample, higher sugary beverage intake was associated
with markers of preclinical AD, including brain atrophy and
poorer episodic memory. Greater intake of total sugary bev-
erages, fruit juice, and soft drinks were all associated with
characteristics of preclinical AD. Additional studies are war-
ranted to confirm our findings and evaluate if sugary bever-
ages are associated longitudinally with worsening of
subclinical AD measures and with incident AD.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXT
1. Systematic review: We searched for relevant litera-
ture using online databases such as SCOPUS and
PubMed. Although studies have investigated the as-
sociations of sugary beverage intake with cardiome-
tabolic disease and stroke, the association of sugary
beverage with subclinical brain injury and dementia
remains little examined in humans.
2. Interpretation: Our findings indicate an association
between higher sugary beverage intake and markers
of preclinical Alzheimer’s disease, including lower
brain volume and poorer memory.
3. Future directions: Prospective studies are needed to
examine whether higher intake of sugary beverages
leads to the progression of Alzheimer’s disease pa-
thology and incident dementia.
