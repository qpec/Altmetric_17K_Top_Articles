Abstract
Background: Numerous studies suggest pre-term birth is associated with cognitive def-
icit. However, less is known about cognitive outcomes following post-term birth, or the
influence of weight variations within term or post-term populations. We examined asso-
ciations between gestational age (GA) and school performance, by weight-for-GA, focus-
ing on extremely pre- and post-term births.
Method: Record linkage study of Swedish children born 1973–94 (n ¼ 2 008 102) with a
nested sibling comparison (n ¼ 439 629). We used restricted cubic regression splines to
examine associations between GA and the grade achieved on leaving secondary educa-
tion, comparing siblings to allow stronger causal inference with regard to associations
between GA and school performance.
Results: Grade averages of both pre- and post-term children were below those of full-
term counterparts and lower for those born small-for-GA. The adjusted grades of
extremely pre-term children (at 24 completed weeks), while improving in later study peri-
ods, were lower by 0.43 standard deviations (95% confidence interval 0.38–0.49), corres-
ponding with a 21-point reduction (19 to 24) on a 240-point scale. Reductions for
extremely post-term children (at 45 completed weeks) were lesser [–0.15 standard devi-
ation (–0.17 to –0.13) or –8 points (–9 to –7)]. Among matched siblings, we observed
weaker residual effects of pre-term and post-term GA on school performance.

 Conclusions: There may be independent effects of fetal maturation and fetal growth on
school performance. Associations among matched siblings, although attenuated, re-
mained consistent with causal effects of pre- and post-term birth on school performance.

Introduction
In developed countries, 5–7% of births occur pre-term (�36
weeks) comprising a major determinant of infant mortality
and health.1 Rates of post-term birth (�42 weeks) vary con-
siderably (0.5–8% in Europe and the US), possibly reflecting
differences in local obstetric practice.2,3 In recent years,
change in obstetric practice has resulted in greater numbers
of induced deliveries,4 influencing rates of post-term birth
over time.5 Although it is often assumed that term and post-
term births are homogeneous with respect to health
outcomes, post-term delivery has been associated with in-
fant mortality6,7 and longer-term health problems.8–10
However, whereas risk of neurodevelopmental problems in
pre-term infants is well established,11–21 little is known
about risk post-term.11,18,22 Evidence suggests cognitive
abilities improve with gestational age (GA) toward term,
reaching a peak at 40 weeks before decreasing towards
late term.22,23 However, most studies remain underpow-
ered to assess whether ability continues to decline with GA
post-term,11,18 or examine the influence of variations in
birth weight in post-term populations.11–14,17,18,21,24–28
Moreover, it is possible that genetic or shared environmen-
tal factors contribute to a non-optimal GA and also
influence later cognitive abilities.12 Such confounding has
not yet been examined in post-term children. We used a
Swedish whole-population cohort to detail the relationship
between GA and school grades across the full range of gesta-
tion (22–45 weeks).
Our aims were to: (i) estimate school-leaving grade
averages for children born at varying GA, taking account
of weight-for-GA; (ii) examine associations between GA
and school grades, focusing specifically on extremely pre-
or post-term children; and (iii) explore confounding by un-
measured familial factors among matched siblings.
Methods
Study cohort
In the Swedish Medical Birth Register (MBR), we identi-
fied live births between 1973 and 1994 (n ¼ 2 277 940)
and linked these, via the registration number, with the
National School Register and other registers from Statistics
Sweden and the National Board of Health and Welfare
(NBHW). Individuals were linked with parents, who in
turn were linked with demographic, socio-economic and
psychiatric data. We excluded (Figure 1) multiple births,
children with missing GA or birth weight, implausible
combinations of GA and birth weight (Supplement Figure 3,
Table 3 available as Supplementary data at IJE online), who
died or emigrated before 16, had no final grade record,
resided abroad within 2 years of attaining their grade or
who could not be linked with parents, leaving 2 008 102 in-
dividuals for population-level analyses. To analyse matched
siblings, we excluded adoptees, children without full siblings
in the cohort and sex-discordant siblings (excluding the least
common sex or retaining females where numbers equalled),
leaving 302 718 same-sex siblings born pre-term to term
and 136 911 born term to post-term.
Exposure
A categorical measure of GA distinguished between ex-
tremely pre-term (22–27 weeks), very pre-term (28–31),
pre-term
(32–33),
late
pre-term
(34–36),
early
term
(37–39) or full-term (40–41) and those born in any of the
post-term weeks (42, 43, 44, 45). We defined GA in days
for use in statistical analyses. For the sibling comparison,
sibling-averaged GA captured between-family variation in
gestational duration.29
Key Messages
• On leaving compulsory secondary education, both pre- and post-term children had lower grades than term
counterparts.
• The grades of small-for-gestational age children were lowest irrespective of gestational age (GA) at birth.
• Despite potential familial confounding, there may be residual causal effects of pre- and post-term GA on school-
leaving-age academic performance.

 Outcome
Academic performance was measured by the final grade
achieved on completing secondary education at 16. For
those completing before 1998, this was the average across
completed subjects (ranging from 1 to 5), whereas, for
those completing from 1998 onwards, we used the
summary score for completed subjects (80 to 320). As this
study covers both grading systems, we calculated year- and
sex-standardized z-scores based on the original grades to
ensure
comparability
between
grading
systems
(Supplement 1, available as Supplementary data at IJE
online).

 Covariates
Data on sex, birth weight (grams), parity (first-born), par-
ental age, birth condition (APGAR �6), birth complica-
tions (Caesarean section, assisted delivery), medical risk
factors (gestational diabetes or hypertension, preeclamp-
sia), congenital malformation and labour induction (for
1990–94) were extracted from the MBR. Standardizing
birth weight distributions to sex and number of completed
weeks’ gestation, we constructed a continuous measure of
weight-for-GA, with children in the lower and upper de-
ciles considered small- and large-for-gestational age (SGA/
LGA). Parental psychiatric history and diagnoses of intel-
lectual disability were obtained from the National Patient
Register, and parental country of birth (Sweden/other)
from the Register of the Total Population. We obtained
family income around birth from the Income and Taxation
Register and the Longitudinal Integration Database for
Health Insurance and Labour Market Studies, adjusting
for family size, and coding income quintiles as described
previously.30 Parental educational achievement (pre-upper-
secondary/upper-secondary/post-upper-secondary) and re-
ceipt of welfare benefits were obtained for 1990–94.
Statistical analysis
Analyses were performed in Stata/SE version 12.1. We as-
sessed prevalence of pre- and post-term birth between 1973
and 1994; calculated grade averages for children born
at varying GA and weight-for-GA; compared characteristics
by GA; and examined associations between GA and school
performance in three adjacent study periods (1973–79,
1980–86, 1987–94) to allow change in association over time.
We used restricted cubic regression splines to model non-
linear associations between GA and school performance, cal-
culating seven knots at the 2.5th, 17.5th, 33.3rd, 50th,
66.6th, 82.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the GA distribution
(the maximum when knot locations are not specified) delin-
eating the range of GA values included in each spline.31 We
analysed the data using mixed models, specifying a random
effect to take account of within-family correlation in school
performance. Covariates (missing for 1%) included weight-
for-GA including a quadratic term, birth year, parity, paren-
tal age, maternal medical risk, parental psychiatric history,
parental country of birth and family income. We calculated
effects on school performance (expressed as the expected
standard deviation change in school grade) across the full
range of GA using xbrcspline post-estimation with those
born at 40 weeks and 4 days as the referent. We then
replaced the continuous weight-for-GA variables with indica-
tors for SGA and LGA birth to assess effects of fetal growth
restriction
and
macrosomia
on
school
performance
irrespective of GA, and assessed the size of these effects spe-
cifically in those born post-term. We did not control for
Apgar, congenital malformation, induced or complicated
births, as these are potential causal pathway characteristics.
To explore familial confounding, we examined associ-
ations after adjustment for sibling-averaged GA. These ef-
fects are interpreted as associations between GA and
school grades, holding constant the tendency of families to
deliver offspring early or late. Sibling-averaged GA there-
fore acts as a proxy for unmeasured familial traits which
may result in non-optimal GA and poorer school perform-
ance and, when adjusted for, provides an estimate of the
within-family effect of variation in GA.29 In the absence
of, or on adjustment for, sibling non-shared confounders,
residual within-family association is consistent with a
causal effect of GA on school performance.32
To avoid comparison of pre-term siblings (for whom
advancing GA is supposedly beneficial) with post-term
counterparts (for whom this may be detrimental), we
examined two cohorts: one in which all were born pre-
term to term; the other with term to post-term individuals.
Replicating our population-level model, we specified the
same knot locations; estimated associations with mixed
models; and calculated effects on school performance
across the full range of GA. The influence of sibling non-
shared confounders was assessed by including covariates
for first-birth, parental age, maternal medical risk factors
and family income.
Sensitivity analyses
We assessed whether associations varied by gender, chil-
dren born with or without congenital abnormalities, or
characteristics
potentially
on
the
causal
pathway
(Supplement 4, available as Supplementary data at IJE on-
line). Individuals with complete socio-economic data
(1989–94) were examined to assess residual socio-eco-
nomic
confounding
(Supplement
5,
available
as
Supplementary data at IJE online).
Results
Prevalence of pre- and post-term birth
Pre-term delivery (�36 weeks) was stable between 4% and
5% (Figure 2), whereas post-term delivery (�42 weeks)
decreased from 14% to 6% during 1973–84, potentially
following changed practice in relation to induction of de-
livery, and stabilized between 6% and 7% until 1994.

 Characteristics of children born at varying
gestational age
Between 1973 and 1994, 4.6% of births were pre-term and
9.4% post-term (Table 1). Late pre-term children (3.6%)
were more likely to have been exposed to maternal medical
risk, birth complications or low Apgar, with highest rates
among children born extremely pre-term. Moderately
post-term children (7.8%) more commonly suffered com-
plicated deliveries or low Apgar, but were less exposed to
maternal medical risk. Rates did not change materially for
children
born
exceedingly
post-term.
Parental
age
decreased with increasing GA. Birth weight increased with
GA to term, but decreased for post-term children.
Grade averages for individuals born at varying
gestational age
The grades of children born at appropriate weight-for-GA
(AGA) improved with GA towards term (40–41 weeks)
and then declined. Irrespective of GA, the grades of SGA
children appeared lowest (Figure 3). Knot locations for
splines were calculated at 252, 271, 277, 281, 285, 290
and 299 gestational days. Following covariate adjustment
(Figure 4), the grades of extremely pre-term children (24
weeks 0 days) in three study periods were 0.43 standard
deviations (SD) (0.38–0.49), 0.41 SD (0.36–0.46) and 0.32
SD (0.28–0.36) below those of full-term counterparts, sug-
gesting they had improved over time. For extremely post-
term children (45 weeks 0 days), grade averages were
lower by 0.15 SD (0.13–0.17), 0.11 SD (0.08–0.15) and
0.12 SD (0.09–0.16) across study periods. Models with in-
dicators for SGA and LGA birth (Supplement 6, available
as Supplementary data at IJE online) suggested growth re-
striction was associated with reduced performance irre-
spective of GA [–0.13 SD (–0.14 to –0.12) in the most
recent study period] and with reduced performance among
those born SGA post-term compared with AGA post-term
counterparts [–0.12 SD (–0.16 to –0.09) in the most recent
study period].
Associations among matched siblings
Four knots were specified for pre-term siblings (252, 271,
277 and 281 days) and three for post-term siblings (285,
290 and 299 days). In matched siblings (Figure 5), effects
diminished
after
adjustment
for
sibling-averaged
GA
(darker shading), particularly in the pre-term sibling cohort
[before: –0.29 SD (–0.34 to 0.24) at 24 weeks, after: –0.18
SD (–0.23 to –0.12) at 24 weeks] an to a lesser extent for
post-term siblings [before: –0.11 SD (–0.14 to –0.07) at
45 weeks, after: –0.07 SD (–0.11 to –0.03) at 45 weeks].
Sensitivity analyses
Effects of extremely pre-term birth (Supplement 4, avail-
able as Supplementary data at IJE online) were stronger in
males, or when occurring with congenital anomalies or
low Apgar. Post-term effects were stronger when occurring
with low Apgar. For births following induction, there was
no association between post-term GA and school perform-
ance. Importantly, the grades of pre- and post-term chil-
dren remained lower than those of term counterparts when
considering only uncomplicated spontaneous deliveries,
with normal Apgar and without congenital anomalies.
Additional adjustment for parental educational attainment
and welfare benefits resulted in moderately weaker pre-
and
post-term
effects
(Supplement
5,
available
as
Supplementary data at IJE online).
Discussion
This is the first study to detail associations between GA
and school performance across the full range of gestation.
There were three main findings. First, grade averages were
lower for pre- and post-term children than term counter-
parts, although outcomes appeared to improve over time.
Second, grades of SGA children were lowest irrespective of
GA. Third, despite weaker within-family associations,
there were residual pre- and post-term effects among
matched siblings.

 Strengths and limitations
We used robust statistical methods to assess school per-
formance by GA, examining extremely pre- and post-term
births. Exploring familial confounding among matched sib-
lings, our findings allow stronger causal inference with re-
gard to associations between GA and school performance.
We note the following limitations. First, we could not
examine children without a grade record (6.3%), limiting
the generalisability of our findings to children in main-
stream education. Coincidentally, most children with intel-
lectual disability, a known correlate of pre-term birth,33
were excluded from analyses (Supplement 2, available as
Supplementary data at IJE online), which may have led to
conservative estimates of pre-term effects. Second, for
most of the cohort, GA was estimated by last menstrual
period (LMP) rather than ultrasound. Measurement error

 in exposure may therefore have resulted in underestimation
of population-level34 and within-family associations.35
Third, the sibling comparison design, while controlling for
characteristics that may be missed by covariate adjustment,
is sensitive to bias by sibling non-shared confounding.35,36
In addition to a causal effect on school performance, our
findings are therefore consistent with alternative causal
scenarios depending on the similarity or dissimilarity of
siblings in exposure and confounding characteristics as
described by Frisell et al.35 Fourth, rates of post-term birth
are overestimated when based on LMP.37,38 Given that GA
was determined by LMP for most of the cohort (personal
communication with Milla Bennis at NBHW), the trends
in Figure 2 may exaggerate rates of post-term pregnancy.
However, the decline in post-term pregnancy occurred be-
tween 1973 and 1984 when GA would still have been rou-
tinely assessed with LMP rather than ultrasound. This
would suggest other factors, potentially a greater number
of induced deliveries, may have influenced rates of post-
term pregnancy over time. Fifth, in our sensitivity analyses
of the influence of potential causal pathway characteristics,
there may have been bias from unmeasured confounders of
associations between these potential mediators (e.g. induc-
tion of labour, low Apgar or birth complications) and off-
spring
school
performance
outcomes.
However,
our
finding of associations where these mediators were absent
suggests they did not explain the poorer school perform-
ance outcomes of children born at early or late GA.
Comparison with previous findings
The improving outcomes of pre-term infants over time are
in line with Danish evidence of reduction in risk of autism
spectrum disorder associated with pre-term birth in recent
birth cohorts,39 and may indicate advances in quality of
perinatal care. Notwithstanding, the lower grades of SGA
children irrespective of GA suggest an independent effect
of fetal growth restriction on later school performance out-
comes18,28 which has persisted over time.
Our findings are consistent with previous studies of
cognitive and behavioural outcomes for pre-term children.

born between 42 and 44 weeks and Yang et al.22 report

ternal medical risk factors and family income. Collinearity statistics suggested individual gestational age and sibling-averaged gestational duration
were correlated, but not collinear in the preterm to term (VIF: 2.35, condition number: 2.69) and term to post-term sibling cohorts (VIF: 2.13, condition
number: 2.52).

 performance controlling for unmeasured familial traits in a
matched sibling design.
Finally, our findings for post-term children are consist-
ent with an earlier Danish study which reports increased
mortality risk among post-term SGA infants compared
with those born post-term at appropriate weight40 and
with our previous study on fetal growth, which suggests
risk for ASD with intellectual disability is greatest among
SGA infants born post-term.41
Interpretation
Our findings suggest there may be unmeasured familial
traits influencing GA at birth and later school perform-
ance. Familial confounders of pre-term birth and offspring
neurodevelopment may involve influences from the shared
environment, such as residual socio-economic factors not
captured by our covariates42 or lifestyle factors such as
poor diet, smoking during pregnancy43–45 or maternal pre-
pregnancy overweight or obesity46–52 in as far as these
occurred across pregnancies. A recent study of risk of
Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in a cohort of
matched Swedish siblings suggests familial confounders of
pre-term birth and offspring neurodevelopment may not be
genetic.53
With respect to confounding in post-term effects, mater-
nal pre-pregnancy obesity is known to influence risk of late
delivery54–57 and may have confounded associations with
offspring neurodevelopment if occurring over multiple
pregnancies.47–52 Furthermore, given that the familial risk
of prolonged pregnancy may be largely genetic,54,58–60 ma-
ternal or fetal genetic factors might confound associations
if they also influence offspring neurodevelopment. Two
studies using data from the Swedish registers evidence a
lesser role for non-genetic familial characteristics in ex-
plaining why some pregnancies exceed term,61,54 which
may account for the smaller attenuation in effect for post-
term siblings in our study.
Residual associations within families suggest there may
also be causal links between GA at birth and later school
performance. Mechanisms linking pre-term birth with
poorer performance may involve poor fetal or childhood
brain development62,63 that could precipitate cognitive or
behavioural difficulties affecting school performance.64–68
Intrauterine infection, which is associated with prematur-
ity,69 may also independently cause problems in fetal brain
development and affect school performance.70,71 Placental
deterioration/insufficiency in prolonged gestation may re-
sult in fetal anoxia and nutritional deficiencies,72,73 with
more or less influence depending on the degree of post-
maturity. Meconium aspiration is also common in post-
term pregnancy74,75 and may independently comprise fetal
brain development.76 Finally, the less favourable outcomes
of post-term SGA infants suggest placental insufficiency
may become particularly toxic to neurodevelopment the
longer a pregnancy endures.
Conclusions
GA was associated with school performance across the en-
tire range of gestation, with poorer outcomes for children
born pre- or post-term and especially for those showing
evidence of poor fetal growth. Our findings for matched
siblings were consistent with causal effects of pre- and
post-term delivery on later school performance, linking
birth at early or late GA with modest reductions in grades
on leaving secondary education at age 16.
Future directions
Studies are needed to examine these relationships in other
populations. Regional differences in management of pre-
and post-term pregnancy may help us understand better
the variations in policy and practice than could help im-
prove the longer-term cognitive outcomes of children born
at non-optimal GA. Future work should also assess
whether our findings for post-term children can be repli-
cated for other health outcomes to help inform policies for
induction of labour in pregnancies at risk of exceeding
term. Modern datasets now tend to base GA on ultrasound
rather than the mother’s LMP which will reduce measure-
ment error of GA in future studies, thereby lessening bias
in the exposure-outcome association. Furthermore, a com-
parison of models using LMP and ultrasound based GA
variables may help to quantify the likely extent of bias in
studies where this information was unavailable. Finally, a
comparison of outcomes for children born spontaneously
at term, induced at term or allowed to progress post-term
may provide useful new information for the management
of prolonged pregnancy.
