Abstract
Background: Many populations have been exposed to environmental lead from paint, petrol, and mining and
smelting operations. Lead is toxic to humans and there is emerging evidence linking childhood exposure with later
life antisocial behaviors, including delinquency and crime. This study tested the hypothesis that childhood lead
exposure in select Australian populations is related to subsequent aggressive criminal behaviors.
Methods: We conducted regression analyses at suburb, state and national levels using multiple analytic methods and
data sources. At the suburb-level, we examined assault rates as a function of air lead concentrations 15–24 years earlier,
reflecting the ubiquitous age-related peak in criminal activity. Mixed model analyses were conducted with and without
socio-demographic covariates. The incidence of fraud was compared for discriminant validity. State and national
analyses were conducted for convergent validity, utilizing deaths by assault as a function of petrol lead emissions.
Results: Suburb-level mixed model analyses showed air lead concentrations accounted for 29.8 % of the variance in
assault rates 21 years later, after adjusting for socio-demographic covariates. State level analyses produced comparable
results. Lead petrol emissions in the two most populous states accounted for 34.6 and 32.6 % of the variance in death
by assault rates 18 years later.
Conclusions: The strong positive relationship between childhood lead exposure and subsequent rates of aggressive
crime has important implications for public health globally. Measures need to be taken to ameliorate exposure to lead
and other environmental contaminants with known neurodevelopmental consequences.

Background
Environmental lead exposure is toxic to humans. Still,
given the difficulty of proving that lead exposure causes
harmful effects, and the cost of interventions, it has been
difficult to implement primary prevention strategies to
achieve lower levels of exposure. This is despite over-
whelming evidence that there is no threshold or appar-
ent safe level of lead exposure in its negative impact on
intelligence, academic achievement and other neuro-
cognitive and health outcomes [1–5]. The annual costs
of childhood lead exposure are estimated to be up to
$50 billion in the USA and €22.7 billion for France [6, 7].
However, the benefit of intervention to mitigate lead ex-
posure is well established. It has been estimated that for
each dollar spent to reduce lead exposure in housing, the
benefit to society is $17 to $220 [8].
Australia is one the world’s largest producers and ex-
porters of lead [9]. However, the majority of research on
the neurocognitive and behavioral effects of lead expos-
ure has been conducted in the USA and elsewhere.
Despite emerging evidence from the USA that links
early life lead exposure with antisocial behaviors, in-
cluding conduct disorder, delinquency and crime [10–12],
there is no published research on the effects of lead expos-
ure on delinquency or criminality across subsets of
Australian populations. In a multi-national study, Nevin
[11] used estimates of Australia’s national blood lead

 trend to correlate to adulthood national criminal behav-
iours, identifying a strong association between preschool
blood lead levels and subsequent crime rate trends. The
prevailing approach to understanding causes of adult
crime focuses heavily on factors such as parenting style,
socioeconomic status, and peer groups [13]. The paucity
of research examining the links between lead exposure
and criminality is surprising given the strong evidence that
childhood lead exposure is linked to a variety of socio-be-
havioral problems that are precursors for criminal be-
havior [12, 14–17].
Historically, lead exposure in Australia has been domi-
nated by three sources: (i) lead paint, (ii) leaded petrol
and (iii) mining and smelting emissions, all of which
pose a potential risk to human health. Blood lead levels
in the Australian population have fallen since the final
removal of lead from petrol in 2002 [18, 19] together
with the reduction of allowable lead in paint to 0.1 % in
1997. However, the legacy of leaded petrol emissions
and the renovation of premises that once used lead paint
continue to pose potential environmental hazards, par-
ticularly in the older parts of Australian cities [20]. Kris-
tensen
[18]
calculated
that
emissions
from
seven
decades of leaded petrol use (1932–2002) exceeded
240,000 tonnes, dwarfing lead mining and smelting
sources [21]; there is a strong relationship between these
emissions and contemporaneous childhood blood lead
levels (r = 0.970, p < 0.00001) [18]. Mining and smelting
operations have also been a major source of lead emis-
sions in Australia [22, 23]. Examples of historical expos-
ure include Port Kembla and Boolaroo in the state of
New South Wales (NSW), which are considered in this
study; while examples of ongoing exposure include
Broken Hill (NSW), Mount Isa (Queensland) and Port
Pirie (South Australia) for which relevant data were not
available. At Port Kembla and Boolaroo, children’s mean
blood lead levels were elevated during smelting opera-
tions - more than three times the current Australian
intervention level of 5 μg/dL [24, 25].
This study addresses the research gap by examining the
relationship between lead exposure of select Australian
populations (including children, who are the most vul-
nerable section of the population to lead toxicity) and
subsequent criminality during adolescence and early
adulthood. We test the hypothesis that there is a sig-
nificant correlation between shifts in lead exposure and
rates of aggressive crime in later life, and we do this at
suburb, state and national levels using multiple methods.
Methods
We operationalize the hypothesis as follows. For the
suburb-level analysis, we examine rates of assault (an
impulsive and aggressive crime) over time as a function
of air lead concentrations 15–24 years earlier in NSW
suburbs where sufficient data are available. As a test for
discriminant validity, we also examine the relationship
between air lead concentrations and fraud rates in the
same suburbs; fraud being a non-impulsive and non-
aggressive crime. We supplement our analysis by exam-
ining the relationship between lead exposure and later
aggressive crime at different geographic scales by investi-
gating state and national data over time. Due to restric-
tions on data availability, we utilize total lead emissions
from the combustion of leaded petrol as a proxy for lead
exposure, and deaths by assault as a proxy for aggressive
crime.
Study sites
We conducted suburban analyses of air lead concentra-
tions and criminal behaviors in NSW. Suburbs were in-
cluded if air lead data were available for at least 30 years.
The six suburbs were: Boolaroo, Earlwood, Lane Cove,
Port Kembla, Rozelle and Rydalmere. Table 1 summa-
rises the descriptive statistics for the six sites. The aver-
age population at risk of exposure in these suburbs over
the relevant census period (1976–1991) ranged from
1392 in Boolaroo to 17,729 in Earlwood. The Sydney
central business district (CBD) also had these data avail-
able, but it was excluded due to the transience of the
resident population and the likelihood that local resi-
dents were not responsible for the exceptionally large
number of recorded assaults. The average annual assault
rate in Sydney CBD from 1995 to 2014 was 10,730 per
100,000 population; the next highest was Port Kembla
with 1627 per 100,000 population. The suburbs included
in the study varied in size, socio-demographic characteris-
tics, and air lead concentrations (see Table 1). Four of the
six are metropolitan locations, which were impacted pri-
marily by leaded petrol emissions, while Boolaroo and
Port Kembla are regional communities with a history of
lead, zinc and copper smelting that caused significant en-
vironmental lead pollution. We also examined aggregated
death by assault data from each Australian state and terri-
tory, as well as national data. The average population at
risk of exposure over the relevant period (1958–2002)
ranged from 5.39 million in NSW to 119,370 in the
Northern Territory [26].
Data sources
All available air lead data were extracted from NSW En-
vironment Protection Authority records for the suburb-
level analyses. The values were reported as micrograms
per cubic metre (μg/m3) from air monitoring stations,
dating as far back as 1973. The annual air lead value for
each site was calculated as the mean of all readings for
each year. Where there was more than one monitoring
station in a suburb, the station with the most complete

 data was used to maximize reliability in the variation in
lead levels over time.
Annual
atmospheric
lead
emissions
(tonnes
per
annum) by state were taken from Kristensen [18] for the
state-level analyses. These data were derived from the
volume of leaded petrol sales, the known but varying
concentrations of lead in petrol over time, and the per-
centage of lead emitted from combustion. The state-
level lead data were aggregated for the purpose of the
national-level analysis. Because petrol lead emission data
are less specific in terms of exposure compared to
suburb-level data based on direct air monitoring, it was
anticipated that resulting state and national analyses
would be less precise.
Crime data for the suburb-level analyses, were ex-
tracted from the Computerised Operational Policing
System (COPS) of the NSW Police Force in February
2015. The records of assaults reported to police were
provided by the NSW Bureau of Crime Statistics and Re-
search, and included statistics from 1995 to 2014. Rates
of
assault
were
used
to
operationalize
impulsive
aggression-related crimes. The assault statistics included
domestic and non-domestic violence, and assaults on
police. Rates of fraud were used as a control for non-
impulsive and non-aggressive crime. Total assault rates
and fraud rates per 100,000 population were calculated
for the postcode (zipcode) corresponding to each of the
six suburbs. Customized population data were sourced
from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) based on
official five yearly census data.
Customized data on deaths by assault were obtained
from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare’s
General Record of Incidence of Mortality books for the
state-level analyses. The relevant deaths comprised those
in categories X85–Y09 of the latest International Classi-
fication of Disease (ICD–10), and equivalent categories
in prior iterations of ICD–10 [27]. These categories in-
clude homicides and injuries inflicted by another person
with intent to injure or kill, by any means. A breakdown
of deaths by state was available only for the period
1964–2012. The number of deaths per state was then
scaled by the mid-year resident population of that state
using demographic data from the ABS to determine the
deaths by assault per 100,000 population.
The crime data reveal marked differences in rates of
offending by age. This phenomenon has long been rec-
ognized in criminological literature across time, social
contexts, demographic groups and crime types, although
its causes are contested [28]. The peak age in Australia
for recorded crime comprising acts intended to cause in-
jury (including assaults) is 15–24 years [29]. A somewhat
similar age peak occurs in relation to crimes of fraud or
deception, although it is far less pronounced. The ‘age-
crime curve’ is relevant to determining the optimal time
lag between childhood lead exposure and later criminal-
ity when investigating correlations.
Data analysis
All suburb-level analyses were controlled for major
socio-demographic correlates of crime, including: the
proportion of the population aged 15–24; the proportion
of the population who completed secondary school; and
the median household income per annum. These data
were extracted by the ABS from the 5 yearly Census of
Population and Housing (conducted in 1991, 1996, 2001,
2006 and 2011) for each suburb based on place of usual
residence. We used the census data that was most con-
temporary to the annual crime data. Median household
income was adjusted for inflation (i.e., analysed in 2014
Australian dollars) using the Reserve Bank of Australia’s
inflation calculator [30].
All available data were used for each of the six sub-
urbs, and missing observations were treated as missing
at random. Preliminary analyses were run to examine
the direct relationships between lead in air concentra-
tions and crime rates at each year on the 15–24 year
age-crime curve. A random intercept linear mixed-
effects model was run in SPSS version 22 using max-
imum likelihood estimation, and the relationships be-
tween observations within each suburb were accounted
for using a random subject factor. This model was used
because the assumptions of regression were not appro-
priate (e.g., observations were not independent). Omega-
squared (ω2) values were calculated to provide an
approximation of the variance accounted for by each
variable, i.e., pseudo-R2 [31]. Covariates were subse-
quently included in the best mixed model to examine
the predictive validity of lead exposure after controlling
for major correlates of crime. To test for discriminant
validity with non-impulsive crime, models were tested
using fraud rates as the dependent variable.
For the state-level analyses, death rates (deaths by as-
sault per 100,000 population) were plotted against lead
petrol emissions (tonnes/year) for each state, with 10 dif-
ferent time lags (15–24 years), and linear regression lines
were fitted and coefficients of determination calculated.
Lead petrol emissions for the Australian Capital Terri-
tory were not available separately as they are included in
the NSW data [18]. Corresponding death data were ag-
gregated accordingly. The number of data points varied
according to the time lag applied because the available
emission data (1958–2002) and death data (1964–2012)
were not congruent.
Results
At the suburb level, the zero-order correlations between
lead in air and assault rates peaked at a 21-year lag for
most sites. The correlations at the 21-year lag were
Taylor et al. Environmental Health  (2016) 15:23 
Page 4 of 10
 strong and significant for all sites (range r = .506 to r =
.802, all p values ≤ .022) except Rydalmere (r = .386, p =
.215), which had the shortest time series (see Figs. 1
and 2). Without adjusting for major socio-demographic
correlates of crime, lead in air accounted for 26–64 %
of the variance (ω2) in assault rates at each site 21 years
later (15 % for Rydalmere). It is notable that in the four
metropolitan suburbs, the data points are tightly clus-
tered, with mean annual lead in air levels markedly
lower than in the two smelting communities of Boolaroo
and Port Kembla (Fig. 2). The maximum annual value
was 5.9 μg/m3 (1987) in Boolaroo and 7.8 μg/m3 (1979)
in Port Kembla. This can be compared to the current
national air lead standard of 0.5 μg/m3 (expressed as an
annual average) [32]. Lead in air concentrations in
metropolitan suburbs also exceeded 0.5 μg/m3 until
some years after the introduction of unleaded petrol in
1985 [18].
Direct effects between air lead and assault rates across
all suburbs were examined using linear mixed-effects
models for time lags between 15 and 24 years. The rela-
tionship peaked in the middle of the age-crime curve,
with the strongest direct effect for lead in air as a pre-
dictor of assault rates at the 21-year lag (see Table 2). In
this mixed model, every additional μg/m3 of lead in air
was associated with an increase of 196 assaults per
100,000 population, and lead in air accounted for 38.4 %
of the variance in assault rates.
Major socio-demographic correlates of crime were sub-
sequently added as covariates in the 21-year lag mixed
model. Primary analyses included socio-demographic co-
variates for the years in which the assaults were commit-
ted. As suggested by Bellinger [14] we also examined
models that controlled for socio-demographic vari-
ables at the time of lead exposure, but these variables
did not reach significance in either model and conse-
quently were excluded from the analyses to avoid
multicollinearity
between
the
two
sets
of
socio-
demographic variables.
Accounting for socio-demographic covariates, lead in
air remained a strong predictor of assault rates. For
every additional μg/m3 of lead in air, assault rates
21 years later increased by 163 per 100,000 population
(see Table 3). Lead in air was the strongest predictor in
Fig. 1 Lead in air concentrations and assault rates for six suburbs, 1973–1999

Page 5 of 10
 the model, accounting for 29.8 % of the variance in as-
sault rates 21 years later. By comparison, the proportion
of the population aged 15–24 accounted for 5.4 % of the
variance, and the proportion of the population who
completed secondary school accounted for 5.0 %. Me-
dian income was not a significant predictor in the
model. The proportion of people aged 15–24 had the re-
verse effect on assault rates to that anticipated (i.e., each
additional percentage of the population aged 15–24 was
related to a decrease in assaults). This is most likely re-
lated to the restricted variance in these variables when
expressed as a proportion, and the overlap between the
three socio-demographic variables.
As a test for discriminant validity, mixed models that
examined the relationship between lead in air and fraud
rates were also examined for the 15–24 age-crime curve.
There were some small statistically significant relation-
ships, but the largest effect of lead as a predictor of fraud
rates (lagged 15 years) accounted for only 5.5 % of the
variance. It is apparent that the explanatory power of
lead in air is minimal in relation to fraud rates, which
contrasts markedly with assault rates.
At the state level, strong positive correlations between
petrol lead emissions and death by assault rates were
found only for the states with the largest populations,
highest population densities and greatest petrol lead

 emissions, namely, NSW and Victoria. In these states,
correlations peaked at the 18-year lag, which reflects the
age-crime curve described in the literature [28]. A sim-
ple linear regression model showed that lead emissions
in NSW accounted for 34.6 % of the variance in death
by assault rates 18 years later. Every 2000 additional
tonnes of lead emitted was associated with one add-
itional death. Moreover, there is a clear temporal pattern
to the data. The death by assault rate increases over the
period 1976 to 1992, corresponding to increases in
petrol lead emissions 18 years prior. In the subsequent
period from 1992 to 2012 the death by assault rate falls,
reflecting the reduction in petrol lead emissions 18 years
prior. This hysteresis effect is shown in Fig. 3. In
Victoria, the most densely populated state, a simple lin-
ear
regression
model
showed
that
lead
emissions
accounted for 32.6 % of the variance in death by assault
rates 18 years later. Every 1667 additional tonnes of lead
emissions was associated with one additional death. The
hysteresis pattern observed in the NSW data was also
evident in the Victorian data. In states and territories
with low population densities and low absolute emission
levels, the correlation was negative.
At a national level, the data also demonstrated a posi-
tive correlation between lead emissions and death by as-
sault rates, but the association was weak. National lead
emissions accounted for only 7 % of the variance in na-
tional death by assault rates 18 years later, as the health
and behavioral effects of lead emissions are dissipated at
larger geographic scales.
Discussion
Our study tested the hypothesis that there is a signifi-
cant correlation between air lead exposure and rates of
aggressive crime in later life. The results demonstrate
that after controlling for major socio-demographic cor-
relates of crime there is a strong positive relationship be-
tween lead in air levels and subsequent crime rates. This
has important implications for public health globally.
This is the first Australian study to test the hypothesis
that
lead
exposure
is
associated

 aggressive criminal behaviors at a range of spatial scales.
Lead in air concentrations accounted for 29.8 % of the
variance in assault rates 21 years later in the six localities
measured, after adjusting for socio-demographic covari-
ates. In the most populous Australian states of NSW
and Victoria, total lead petrol emissions accounted for
34.6 and 32.6 %, respectively, of the variance in death by
assault rates 18 years later. Given the variety of possible
determinants of criminal behavior, these are remarkable
findings. The R2 values for the states are not atemporal,
but reflect secular trends in the variables as indicated by
the hysteresis loop in Fig. 3.
These results are robust because the study relies on
statistics from official government and industry agencies
that have collected relevant datasets independently of
each other. We operationalized our hypotheses using
two variables for lead exposure (lead in air concentra-
tions and annual lead petrol emissions) and three vari-
ables for recorded crime (assault, death by assault and
fraud) across different spatial and temporal scales. The
suburbs varied in size, lead levels, crime rates, and
socio-demographic characteristics, and a variety of stat-
istical methods were utilized to analyze the data. Conse-
quently, the consistency of the relationships across the
models suggests the results are robust.
The association between lead in air and lagged assault
rates at the suburb scale exists regardless of whether the
source of lead is smelting or petrol. Five of the six sites
have positive and significant correlations, with the sixth
(Rydalmere) being affected by the small sample size
(Fig. 1). This is important because the temporal pattern
of lead emissions varies across sources and sites and yet
the outputs remain compatible with our hypothesis.
Notably, the strongest relationship was found in the
smelting town of Boolaroo (R2 = 0.64), and the third
highest was in the smelting town of Port Kembla (R2 =
0.36); these suburbs had the highest levels of lead pollu-
tion. Removal of a single outlier in the lead in air data
set for Port Kembla (7.8 μg/m3, 1979) lifted R2 to 0.59.
The study suggests that features of the physical envir-
onment, in this case atmospheric pollution, may be more
important than previously considered in explaining early
adult
criminality.
After
adjusting
for
major
socio-
demographic variables (population age distribution, edu-
cation, income), lead in air remained the largest deter-
minant of variance in assault rates. It accounted for 5.5
times as much of the variance as the single most import-
ant socio-demographic factor and 2.8 times as much as
the combined socio-demographic covariates (Table 3).
The study outcomes are consistent with the neuro-
psychological literature, which suggests that the princi-
pal behavioral traits affected by childhood lead exposure
are reduced impulse control and related impacts on ag-
gressive behaviors [11, 12, 33–36]. Childhood blood lead
exposure is also associated with reduced adult brain vol-
ume in the prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex areas
that are responsible for executive functioning, mood
regulation and decision-making [37].
Our study reveals the importance of lead in air as a
determinant of rates of aggressive crime. This is consist-
ent with Marcus et al.’s [10] meta-analysis of >8000 chil-
dren
and
adolescents,
which
showed
a
significant
association between lead exposure and conduct prob-
lems in later life. By contrast, fraud, which is a non-
impulsive, non-aggressive crime, was only associated
weakly with prior exposure to lead in air (ω2 ≤ 5.5 %).
This study has data limitations that are typical of other
ecological studies, like herd immunity. The measured
correlations between lead in air and subsequent rates of
aggressive crime may be underestimated due to lack of
congruence between the populations exposed to lead
and the populations measured for later criminal behav-
iors [38]. This is a consequence of the deaths and out-
migration of some lead-exposed individuals, the births
over the period subsequent to the measurement of ex-
posure to lead, and the in-migration of other individuals
who have been exposed to lead at unknown concentra-
tions and localities. Quantifying the impact of these pro-
cesses is difficult due to limited data availability at the
suburb level. Over the period 2001–2014, which is only
part of the study time period, there was population
growth in all six suburbs: Earlwood 3.2 %, Port Kembla
3.9 %, Boolaroo 4.4 %, Lane Cove 10.9 %, Rydalmere
16.6 % and Rozelle 30.7 %. All but the last suburb were
below the national average growth of 21.9 % for that
period [39]. There was also substantial turnover in the
membership of the populations of all six suburbs due to
migration. The percentages of people aged over 5 years
who lived in a different local area 5 years before the
2011 census were substantial: Earlwood 22.0 %, Port
Kembla 23.3 %, Boolaroo 26.9 %, Rydalmere 28.0 %,
Lane Cove 36.8 % and Rozelle 49.4 %. Whilst more of
the in-movers to the high turnover suburbs of Lane
Cove and Rozelle came from other parts of Australia,
there were also significant numbers who moved from
overseas. Of the population aged 5 and over in 2011,
11.9 % of Rozelle’s population and 9.9 % of Lane
Cove’s population were living outside Australia 5 years
earlier [39].
With respect to lead in air, it would be desirable to
have broader and more detailed spatial and temporal
coverage. However, we have used the best available data
for which there are also corresponding crime data. For
the suburb level analysis, lead in air concentrations were
sourced
from
a
single
air
monitoring
station
to
characterize exposure across the selected geographic
area. For the state and national analyses, lead petrol
emissions were estimated from petrol sales and are a

 proxy for population lead exposure. With respect to
crime rates, data on assaults are those reported to police,
which may be under-inclusive due to unreported crime
or over-inclusive due to unsubstantiated allegations. As-
sault data is based on the suburb where the assault took
place, not the offender’s residence, which might be more
closely linked with lead exposure. Similarly, death by as-
sault data are based on the state or territory in which
the death was registered, not the residence of the person
who caused the death. Nonetheless, we have found note-
worthy results in the face of limitations that might have
been expected to obscure the relevant relationships.
Finally, the study suggests productive areas for future re-
search with respect to lead and other neurotoxic metals
[40]. This study is one of association not causation. More
specificity could be obtained by examining the blood lead
concentrations of individuals and undertaking a prospect-
ive longitudinal study of their behavioral responses. While
a few studies have achieved this benchmark [10, 12, 34],
more research is required across different populations and
contaminants. Better data will help formulate evidence-
based policies to improve health and social outcomes.
Taken together, the results of the present study high-
light that atmospheric lead standards require systematic
review
by
national
and
international
agencies.
At
present, standards vary widely. For example, the lead in
air standard is 0.5 μg/m3 (annual) (1 μg/m3, seasonal) in
China, 0.5 μg/m3 in Australia and 0.15 μg/m3 in the
USA. The method for calculating acceptable levels also
varies. In Australia the standard is based on an annual
average, with no upper limit on short-term spikes; in the
USA it is based on a 3-month rolling average, which is
more restrictive on polluters. Future revisions of lead in
air standards need to be tied to demonstrable health out-
comes, cognizant of their impact on anti-social behaviors.
Measures need to be taken to reduce or eliminate extant
sources of atmospheric lead pollution wherever practic-
able. Exposures from these sources have the potential to
increase anti-social behaviors and impose unnecessary so-
cietal costs. These sources include existing mining and
smelting operations in Australia and elsewhere, and lead
petrol consumption in countries where it is still sold:
Algeria, Iraq, and Yemen [41]. In these countries, some
103 million people remain at risk from the use of lead
petrol [42]. There are also policy implications for commu-
nities that have been historically affected by the deposition
of atmospheric lead in populated places such as homes,
gardens, playgrounds and schools. These depositions
present an ongoing risk because the half-life of environ-
mental lead exceeds 700 years [43].
Conclusions
This study found a robust relationship between lead in
air and subsequent rates of aggressive crime at suburb,
state and national population levels using multiple ana-
lytic methods and data sources. These results add to the
existing body of literature that highlights the sequelae of
lead exposure. Fortunately, exposure to lead is prevent-
able and remedial intervention is cost effective [8]. Given
the overwhelming evidence that there is no safe lower
threshold for lead toxicity, remediation programs are es-
sential to mitigate these effects and should be a clear
priority for immediate policy change.
