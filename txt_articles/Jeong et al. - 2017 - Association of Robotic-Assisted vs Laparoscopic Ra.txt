IMPORTANCE Use of robotic surgery has increased in urological practice over the last decade.
However, the use, outcomes, and costs of robotic nephrectomy are unknown.
OBJECTIVES To examine the trend in use of robotic-assisted operations for radical
nephrectomy in the United States and to compare the perioperative outcomes and costs
with laparoscopic radical nephrectomy.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This retrospective cohort study used the Premier
Healthcare database to evaluate outcomes of patients who had undergone robotic-assisted
or laparoscopic radical nephrectomy for renal mass at 416 US hospitals between January
2003 and September 2015. Multivariable regression modeling was used to assess outcomes.
EXPOSURES Robotic-assisted vs laparoscopic radical nephrectomy.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome of the study was the trend in use of
robotic-assisted radical nephrectomy. The secondary outcomes were perioperative
complications, based on the Clavien classification system, and defined as any complication
(Clavien grades 1-5) or major complications (Clavien grades 3-5, for which grade 5 results in
death); resource use (operating time, blood transfusion, length of hospital stay); and direct
hospital cost.
RESULTS Among 23 753 patients included in the study (mean age, 61.4 years; men, 13 792
[58.1%]), 18 573 underwent laparoscopic radical nephrectomy and 5180 underwent
robotic-assisted radical nephrectomy. Use of robotic-assisted surgery increased from 1.5%
(39 of 2676 radical nephrectomy procedures in 2003) to 27.0% (862 of 3194 radical
nephrectomy procedures) in 2015 (P for trend <.001). In the weighted-adjusted analysis,
there were no significant differences between robotic-assisted and laparoscopic radical
nephrectomy in the incidence of any (Clavien grades 1-5) postoperative complications
(adjusted rates, 22.2% vs 23.4%, difference, −1.2%; 95% CI, −5.4 to 3.0%) or major (Clavien
grades 3-5) complications (adjusted rates, 3.5% vs 3.8%, difference, −0.3%; 95% CI, −1.0% to
0.5%). The rate of prolonged operating time (>4 hours) for patients undergoing the
robotic-assisted procedure was higher than for patients receiving the laparoscopic procedure
in the adjusted analysis (46.3% vs 25.8%; risk difference, 20.5%; 95% CI, 14.2% to 26.8%).
Robotic-assisted radical nephrectomy was associated with higher mean 90-day direct
hospital costs ($19 530 vs $16 851; difference, $2678; 95% CI, $838 to $4519), mainly
accounted for operating room ($7217 vs $5378; difference, $1839; 95% CI, $1050 to $2628)
and supply costs ($4876 vs $3891; difference, $985; 95% CI, $473 to $1498).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients undergoing radical nephrectomy for renal
mass between 2003 and 2015, the use of robotic-assisted surgery increased substantially.
The use of robotic-assistance was not associated with increased risk of any or major
complications but was associated with prolonged operating time and higher hospital costs
compared with laparoscopic surgery.

adical nephrectomy for renal cancer remains the
standard of care for large tumors with curative intent
and has become the preferred treatment option for T1
and T2 tumors not amenable to nephron-sparing surgery.1
Evidence suggests that there are no significant differences in
oncological outcomes between laparoscopic and open radical
nephrectomy, although laparoscopic procedures confer cer-
tain advantages over the open approach in terms of morbid-
ity, blood loss, hospital length of stay, and postoperative anal-
gesic requirements.2,3
Robotic surgery, in particular, has been rapidly adopted
for a wide range of procedures over the last decade in the
United States. While increasingly preferred for procedures that
requiredopensurgery,suchasprostatectomy,ithasalsogradu-
ally replaced conventional laparoscopic surgery. This has
largely been driven by extensive marketing and competition
among hospitals to offer the most advanced technology.4-7
However, the introduction and rapid adoption of the robotic
platform has resulted in increased costs without significantly
improving outcomes compared with nonrobotic minimally in-
vasive approaches.7-10
Since the first use of robotic-assisted radical nephrec-
tomy for renal cancer was reported in 2005, several small,
single institutional observational studies have reported lim-
ited evidence on oncological and perioperative outcomes,
which may not have true clinical relevance.11 Some studies
have shown equivalent perioperative outcomes despite
increased costs of robotic-assisted compared with laparo-
scopic radical nephrectomy, yet most of these studies were
limited by small sample sizes, lack of randomization, and
antiquated data.12-14 The objective of this study was to exam-
ine the utilization of robotic-assisted radical nephrectomy in
the United States from 2003 to 2015 and to compare the
in-hospital outcomes and costs between the 2 procedures.
Methods
Data Source
A retrospective cohort study was performed using the
Premier Healthcare database (Premier), an all-payer, fee-
supported database developed to measure resource use and
quality, to assess the usage of the robotic platform for radi-
cal nephrectomy. This database captures approximately
20% of all hospitalizations from more than 700 acute care
hospitals in the United States (>530 million hospital visits
and 6 million inpatient discharges per year since 2011).
This database also contains information on demographic
and clinical characteristics, such as pharmaceuticals admin-
istered, laboratory and other diagnostic tests performed,
and therapeutic services provided during admission. The
Premier Healthcare database uses a reconciliation process
that allows for verification and validation of hospital report-
ing for the use of resources and cost. Data audits are per-
formed, and if reported costs submitted do not match the
hospital’
s financial statement, Premier works with the hos-
pital to correct the discrepancy.15 Procedure and comorbid-
ity data are provided by International Classification of Dis-
eases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes. This method has been
used in other studies.6,8,16,17 This investigation was deemed
exempt from informed consent requirements by the Stan-
ford University Medical Center institutional review board.
Patients
Patients receiving radical nephrectomy between January
2003 and September 2015 were identified by ICD-9 code
(55.51) and included in the analysis. Affiliated codes were
identified and reviewed to ensure that radical nephrectomy
was the primary procedure performed based on the diagnosis
or concern for kidney cancer (eTable 1 in the Supplement).
For example, cases of upper tract urothelial carcinoma (ICD-9
codes 189.1 or 189.2), which have unique postoperative com-
plication profiles stemming from the need for concurrent
ureterectomy and cystotomy were excluded. Only patients
receiving either robotic-assisted or laparoscopic radical
nephrectomy were included. Patients undergoing open radi-
cal nephrectomy or nonelective surgeries were excluded. The
inclusion and exclusion methodology is further depicted in
the eFigure in the Supplement.
Main Exposures
Patients receiving robotic-assisted or laparoscopic radical
nephrectomy were identified using the Charge Description
Master, a catalog of all billable items eventually charged to
the patient, to avoid possible inaccuracies stemming from
the use of the ICD-9 coding system in identifying robotic-
assisted surgery.17 The utilization of supplies unique to
robotic procedures, as specified by the EndoWrist Instrument
& Accessory Catalog from Intuitive Surgical, was used as an
indicator for the use of robotic-assistance.18 Nonrobotic cases
were identified in a similar manner.
Demographic and Clinical Characteristics
Hospital-level data collected directly by Premier included size
(<300, 300-500, and >500 beds), location (urban, rural), and
teaching status (teaching, nonteaching). Patient-related data
included year of surgery, age, race (white, black, and other),
sex, and insurance status (private, Medicare, Medicaid, and
other). Race determination was based on self-reporting by the
patient and included in the demographics analysis to further
Key Points
Questions Has the use of robotic-assisted vs laparoscopic radical
nephrectomy changed from 2003 to 2015?
Findings The proportion of radical nephrectomies using
robotic-assisted operations increased from 1.5% in 2003 to 27.0%
in 2015. Although there was no significant difference between
robotic-assisted vs laparoscopic radical nephrectomy in major
postoperative complications, robotic-assisted procedures were
associated with longer operating time and higher direct hospital
costs.
Meaning The use of robotic-assisted radical nephrectomy
increased substantially from 2003 to 2015 and was associated
with prolonged operating time and increased costs.

egorized based on the Charlson comorbidity index (0, 1, ≥2).
Outcomes
The primary outcome of the study was the trend in use of the
robotic-assisted radical nephrectomy. The secondary out-
comes of interest were perioperative complications, resource
use, and direct hospital costs. Postoperative complications
were classified based on the Clavien classification system.20
These complications were defined as any (Clavien grades 1-5)
or major (Clavien grades 3-5). Grade 1 complications in-
clude “Any deviation from the normal postoperative course
without the need for pharmacological treatment or surgical,
endoscopic, and radiological intervention.” Grade 2 com-
plications “[require] pharmacologic treatment with drugs
other than such allowed for grade 1 complications.” Grade 3
complications “[require] surgical, endoscopic or radiological
intervention.” Grade 4 describes “Life-threatening com-
plications requiring intermediate care/intensive care unit.”
Grade 5 complications result in the “[d]eath of a patient.”
To identify events defined by the Clavien classification
system, we used ICD-9 codes as previously described.6,21
Resource use variables analyzed included blood transfusion
(packed red blood cells), operating time (hours), and length
of stay (days). Operating time (≤4 hours vs >4 hours) and
length of stay (≤4 days vs >4 days) were categorized as dichoto-
mous variables.19,22
Two types of direct hospital costs were provided by the
Premier Healthcare database. A total of 78.5% of all patients
included in the study were treated by hospitals providing pro-
cedural costs (or “reported costs”) and the remainder were
treated by hospitals providing estimates based on Medicare
cost-to-charge ratios (MCCR or “estimated costs”).17,23,24
If hospitals have their own cost-accounting system, they as-
sign relative value units to procedures to estimate cost. These
hospitalsarethenabletoprovidePremierwithbothchargeand
cost data. If hospitals do not have a cost-accounting system or
do not use relative value units to estimate cost, they provide
only charge data. Hospital departments are mapped to a spe-
cific line on the Medicare Cost Report to determine the appro-
priate MCCR, which is then used to determine cost at a given
resource level. All costs were adjusted to 2015 US dollars using
the consumer price index.
Statistical Analyses
Categorical variables were presented as numbers and per-
centages and were compared using the χ2 test. Linear trends
in the proportion of robotic-assisted radical nephrectomies
over 13 years were assessed using a logistic regression
model. To reduce potential confounding, we performed an
adjustment for differences in baseline patient characteristics
by using a weighted logistic regression model with inverse
probability of treatment weighting (IPTW).25 Using this tech-
nique, the weights used for patients undergoing laparo-
scopic radical nephrectomy were the inverse of 1 minus the
propensity score, and weights used for patients receiving
robotic-assisted radical nephrectomy were the inverse of the
propensity score alone. The propensity scores were esti-
mated by multiple logistic regression analysis without
regard to outcomes. A full nonparsimonious model was
developed including all variables shown in Table 1.
Log-binomial regression models were used to estimate
risk ratios (RRs) for each exposure on perioperative out-
comes. Since it was determined that the outcome variables re-
lated to direct hospital costs were not normally distributed,
a generalized linear model with gamma distribution was gen-
erated, allowing for a link function to connect the predictor
with the response variables.26 All models were adjusted for
clustering of patients within hospitals using robust standard
errors to account for interhospital variability. An analysis
was also conducted to determine if the costs related to each
surgical approach (robotic-assisted and laparoscopic radical
nephrectomy) were related to the source of cost obtained
within the Premier Hospital database. For these analyses,
the propensity score analyses were re-performed to obtain
a new IPTW for each patient. These analyses were not pre-
specified but rather post hoc and thus interpreted as explor-
atory. Statistical analysis was performed using 2-sided tests,
with a significance level of <.05 and Stata 14 statistical soft-
ware (StataCorp).
Results
A cohort of 23 753 patients undergoing elective laparoscopic
radicalnephrectomy(n = 18 573)orrobotic-assistedradicalne-
phrectomy (n = 5180) for the management of renal masses at
416 US hospitals between 2003 and 2015 was evaluated. The
Figure shows the trend in surgical approach for radical ne-
phrectomy over time. Use of robotic-assisted surgery for radi-
cal nephrectomy increased from 1.5% to 27.0% in the entire
radical nephrectomy cohort from 2003 to 2015 (P for trend
<.001). Since 2009, the decrease in laparoscopic radical ne-
phrectomies paralleled the increase in robotic-assisted radi-
cal nephrectomies, while the proportion of open radical ne-
phrectomy cases plateaued. By 2015, robotic-assisted radical
nephrectomy was performed more commonly than laparo-
scopic radical nephrectomy in the United States.
The characteristics before and after propensity weight-
ing are summarized in Table 1. Before the propensity weight-
ing process, the robotic-assisted and laparoscopic radical ne-
phrectomy cohorts differed in several variables, particularly
yearofsurgery,Charlsoncomorbidityindex,andinsurancesta-
tus. After propensity score weighting, similar covariate distri-
butions were achieved between robotic-assisted and laparo-
scopic radical nephrectomy in the weighted populations
(the standardized difference score, <0.2).

 radical nephrectomy. Prolonged length of stay was less fre-
quent in the robotic-assisted vs the laparoscopic radical ne-
phrectomy group (21.2% vs 25.1%; risk difference, −3.9%;
95% CI, −5.2% to −2.7%). However, the IPTW-adjusted rates
of any or major complications, blood transfusion, and pro-
longed length of stay were similar between the robotic-
assisted and laparoscopic radical nephrectomy groups.
The IPTW-adjusted rate of prolonged operating time for pa-
tients undergoing robotic-assisted radical nephrectomy was
higher than for patients receiving laparoscopic radical ne-
phrectomy (46.3% vs 25.8%; risk difference, 20.5%; 95% CI,
14.2% to 26.8%).
An unadjusted cost comparison by surgical approach
is presented in the eTable 2 in the Supplement. The IPTW-
adjusted analysis suggests that robotic-assisted radical
nephrectomy was associated with higher mean 90-day direct
hospital costs ($19530 vs $16851; difference, $2678; 95% CI,
$838 to $4519), likely accounted for by higher operating room
($7217 vs $5378; difference, $1839; 95% CI, $1050 to $2628)
and supply costs ($4876 vs $3891; difference, $985, 95%
CI, $473 to $1498; Table 3). Further analyses were performed
to identify the association of the source of cost obtained by
the Premier data set (reported vs estimated) and the differ-
ence in direct hospital costs between robotic-assisted and

direct hospital ($19 471 vs $16 779; difference, $2692; 95% CI,
$787 to $4597), supply ($4905 vs $3999; difference, $906;

$5265; difference, $1758; 95% CI, $869 to $2647) were higher
for robotic-assisted radical nephrectomy among patients
treated at hospitals providing reported costs. Among patients
receiving care from hospitals providing estimated costs using
MCCR, robotic-assisted radical nephrectomy was associated
with higher supply costs ($4728 vs $3474; difference, $1254;
95% CI, $136 to $2373) and operating room costs ($7589 vs
$5810; difference, $1779; 95% CI, $227 to $3331) but similar
90-day direct hospital cost compared with laparoscopic radi-
cal nephrectomy ($19 187 vs $17 112; difference, $2075; 95%
CI, −$1288 to $5439).
Discussion
In this retrospective cohort study evaluating patients under-
going robotic-assisted or laparoscopic radical nephrectomy
for renal mass in the United States between 2003 and 2015,
use of robotic-assisted surgery increased from 1.5% to
27.0% for the entire radical nephrectomy cohort. Compared
with laparoscopic radical nephrectomy, robotic-assisted
radical nephrectomy was not associated with an increased
risk of any or major postoperative complications but was
associated with prolonged operating time and higher hospi-
tal costs.
The use of the robotic platform has increased rapidly
for curative renal surgery, especially for partial nephrecto-

 mies. However, little is known about the nationwide use of
robotic-assistance for radical nephrectomy in the United
States. Some studies have suggested that the proportion of
robotic-assisted cases was less than 10% of all radical
nephrectomies during the late 2000s.13,27 In contrast, this
study found that the proportion of robotic-assisted radical
nephrectomies increased to approximately 30% of all radi-
cal nephrectomies by 2015, which is higher than for the
laparoscopic approach in the United States. A parallel
decrease in the use of laparoscopic radical nephrectomy
suggests a shift to robotic surgery from cases that would
have been previously treated laparoscopically rather than
by open surgery.
It remains unclear why the use of robotic-assistance
has increased substantially and has been steadily replac-
ing laparoscopic radical nephrectomies. One possibility is
the financial viability of the robotic system in relatively
small hospitals. The costs of purchasing and maintain-
ing the robotic system range from $0.5 to $2.5 million and
$80 000–$170 000 per year , respectively.28 Surgeons have
to perform at least 100 to 150 procedures annually to
offset the upfront and ongoing costs of its acquisition.29
Another possibility is that the increase in robotic-assisted
radical nephrectomies might be associated with the known
increase in robotic-assisted partial nephrectomies. The
use of robotic-assistance has increased rapidly since 2008
and in some areas has overtaken laparoscopic partial
nephrectomy.27,30 This trend suggests an overall increase in
the risk of intraoperative conversion to radical nephrectomy
as surgeons attempt to treat larger and more complex tumors
using the nephron-sparing approach.31 Considering that the
incidence of intraoperative robotic-assisted partial to radical
nephrectomy conversion remains prevalent especially for
low-volume hospitals and surgeons in the United States, the
increase in unsuccessful robotic-assisted partial nephrecto-
mies may have contributed to the increase in robotic-assisted
radical nephrectomy use.32 As urological training has been
focused on robotic surgery driven predominantly by the
widespread use of robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy
(more than 80% of the total prostatectomies in the United
States in 2013), urologists completing their residency or fel-
lowship training may also prefer the robotic platform over
laparoscopic surgery due to its ergonomic console and
3-dimensional screen.6

 Although the use of the robotic platform has been well-
received by surgeons performing laparoscopic partial nephrec-
tomy due to ease of tumor resection and renorrhaphy, the evi-
dence supporting the use of robotic-assistance for radical
nephrectomy remains somewhat biased. Radical nephrec-
tomy does not require the routine use of intracorporeal sutur-
ing, which is a primary advantage of robotic assistance in par-
tial nephrectomy and radical prostatectomy. Furthermore,
there are several disadvantages of robotic technology scarcely
acknowledged by prior literature. For example, robot arms
return minimal tactile feedback to the surgeon. Moreover,
the field of view during robotic-assisted radical nephrectomy
is relatively narrow. Therefore, special attention is required to
prevent unintentional trauma to peripheral organs not felt or
visualized by the surgeon.10
There is also a significant cost burden attributed to the
use of the robotic system. This study shows that the use of
the robotic platform for radical nephrectomy increased the
total direct hospital cost by nearly $2700, which is more
than 15% of the total cost of the laparoscopic approach.
This increased expense for robotic-assisted radical nephrec-
tomy was mostly accounted for by increased operating
room cost, which is directly correlated with operating time.
These findings are consistent with the observations of a
study from Maryland that reported a $5111 increase in hospi-
tal charges per robotic-assisted radical nephrectomy com-
pared with laparoscopic radical nephrectomy.33 Hospitals are
likely to increase charges for robotic surgery to recoup costs
related to the acquisition and maintenance of the robotic sys-
tem despite not receiving reimbursement for these fixed
costs from Medicare and private insurers.34 Increased hospi-
tal charges for robotic surgery influence future reimburse-
ment because the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services
(CMS) use hospital charges to calculate the relative weight for
each diagnosis related group (DRG) annually, which in turn
help determine the payment made for inpatient services.
The DRG weight is determined by the average resources
required to treat cases within the DRG and is multiplied by
the average payment rate for a typical case to yield the total
reimbursement rate.35 Thus, hospitals are incentivized to
charge payers for the true cost of robot use. A prior study
estimates an additional cost to the health care system of
$2.5 billion if conventional surgeries were to be fully replaced
by robotic surgery.7
As for the acquisition, maintenance, and replacement of
the robot, the attainment of these costs remains challeng-
ing. The true cost of the robot varies based on factors such
as the number of robotic cases being performed by each
hospital, nonurological use of the robot technology, the
type of robotic system being used, specific price negotia-
tions between the hospital and robot company, and likely
other variables as well. Thus, the fixed costs of the robot
cannot be accurately determined by this database.
Robotic surgery was associated with higher 90-day di-
rect hospital costs (>$2692) for hospitals providing reported
costs, though not for hospitals providing MCCR-estimated
costs. Although CMS uses hospital charges to estimate the
relative cost of treating patients, charges tend to vary among
hospitals according to size, location, payer mix, and for-
profit status.36,37 Given the potential for variability using the
latter process, hospitals have been encouraged to adopt an in-
ternalcost-measurementsystem.38Therefore,thehighercosts
for robotic surgery observed for patients from hospitals pro-
viding reported costs may have greater clinical relevance
and accuracy.
Robotic partial nephrectomy does have some advantages
over traditional laparoscopic partial nephrectomy, including
reduced ischemic time and total operating time. However,
this study suggests that the traditional advantages of robotic
surgery are not applicable to radical nephrectomy when
compared with conventional laparoscopy. Some high-
volume surgeons also argue that robotic-assisted radical
nephrectomy may be beneficial for treating advanced kidney
cancer with vena cava tumor thrombus in a minimally inva-
sive manner.39 However, that does not adequately explain
the rapid increase in robotic-assisted radical nephrectomy
within the United States because these advanced kidney
cancers have been largely treated by the open approach.
Although the initial results of safety and short-term onco-
logical outcomes are promising, further investigation is
required to determine the role of robotic surgery for vena
cava tumor thrombectomy.
Limitations
This study has several limitations. First, it is subject to
potential misclassification bias as billing codes and ICD-9
procedural codes were used to capture robotic-assisted sur-
geries. However, previous studies using the same method
showed that ICD-9 coding for robotic-assisted surgery was
sufficiently specific.6,8,17 Second, the Premier Healthcare
database does not publish information regarding tumor
characteristics. Large or complex renal tumors, such as hilar
and endophytic tumors, increase the risk for perioperative
complications during laparoscopic surgery, although more
notably for partial nephrectomy.40 The influence of tumor
characteristics is likely negligible for both robotic-assisted
and laparoscopic radical nephrectomy because they are
both minimally invasive and have similar clinical indica-
tions. Third, because the rate of conversion to open radical
nephrectomy is difficult to evaluate retrospectively, the
rates of conversion could not be compared between the 2
approaches using the Premier Healthcare database. Fourth,
long-term data are necessary to further compare oncological
outcomes and quality of life between robotic-assisted and
laparoscopic radical nephrectomy.
Conclusions
Among patients undergoing radical nephrectomy for
renal mass between 2003 and 2015, the use of robotic-
assisted surgery increased substantially. The use of robotic-
assistance was not associated with increased risk of any or
major complications but was associated with prolonged
operating time and higher hospital costs compared with
laparoscopic surgery.
