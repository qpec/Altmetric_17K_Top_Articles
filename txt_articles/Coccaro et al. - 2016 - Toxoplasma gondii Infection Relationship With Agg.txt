T
oxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) is a highly successful neurotropic 
protozoan parasite, infecting any warm-blooded animal 
including approximately one-third of all humans.1 Within the 
animal world, felids have been identified as the definitive host 
of T. gondii that localizes only in the gastrointestinal tract of any 
member of the cat family. Humans may be infected by T. gondii 
via ingestion of the parasite’s oocysts, which can spread from 
the feces of infected cats. Other routes of transmission include 
consumption of undercooked meat that has been infected with 
T. gondii cysts or ingestion of contaminated water2,3; congenital 
infection, occurring if a mother has a primary infection during 
pregnancy and transmits T. gondii to the fetus, is relatively rare. 
Postnatal chronic “latent” infection is very common, minimally 
symptomatic in the immune competent host, and with an 
encephalitic picture in the immunocompromised.4 When 
ingested by an intermediate host, the parasite uses leukocytes 
to travel from the intestine to other organs, finally localizing 
in muscle and brain. Once in the brain, T. gondii hides within 
neurons and glial cells, forming characteristic cystic intracellular 
structures under the pressure of the immune system.5 Although 
it is thought to be relatively harmless in immunocompetent 
adults, latent toxoplasmosis has been linked to several psychiatric 
disorders (eg, schizophrenia,6,7 bipolar disorder,7–9 personality 
disorders10) and with suicidal behavior.11–17
Given the strong relationship between suicidal behavior and 
impulsive aggressive behavior,18 either as a dimension or as a 
category, and in light of a recent study19 that reported that T. 
gondii seropositivity status may be associated with high self-
reported trait aggression and impulsivity in mentally healthy 
individuals, we hypothesized that the categorical presence of 
immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to T. gondii would (1) be 
associated with higher aggression and impulsivity scores in a 
sample of psychiatric and healthy control subjects and (2) be 
more frequent in individuals with intermittent explosive disorder 
(IED), a disorder of recurrent, problematic, and impulsive 
aggressive behavior, compared with healthy controls. In this 
study, we used psychometric assessments20–23 as the dimensional 
representation of impulsive aggression and the presence of IED 
as the categorical representation24 of impulsive aggression.
METHOD
Subjects
Three hundred fifty-eight physically healthy subjects 
participated in this study. All subjects were systematically 
evaluated in regard to aggressive, anxiety, and other behaviors 
as part of a larger program that is designed to study correlates of 
ABSTRACT
Objective: Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii), a protozoan parasite 
that persists in host tissues, including brain, has been 
associated with several psychiatric disorders and with suicidal 
behavior. We sought to test the hypothesis that latent T. gondii 
infection, as manifest by circulating immunoglobulin G (IgG) 
antibodies to T. gondii, is associated with both categorical and 
dimensional measures of aggression.
Method: IgG antibodies to T. gondii were collected between 
1991 and 2008 from 358 adult subjects with DSM-5 
intermittent explosive disorder (IED), non-IED psychiatric 
disorders (psychiatric controls), or no evidence of any 
psychiatric diagnosis (healthy controls). Assessments of 
aggression, anger, and impulsivity, as well as state/trait anger, 
depression, and anxiety were completed. T. gondii seropositive 
status (IgG > 12 IU) was the primary outcome measure for this 
study.
Results: T. gondii seropositive status (IgG > 12 IU) was 
associated with higher aggression (P = .022) and impulsivity 
(P = .05) scores. When both aggression and impulsivity scores 
were controlled for, however, only aggression scores were 
higher in seropositive subjects (P = .011). In addition, T. gondii 
seropositive status and marginal mean ± SE aggression scores 
increased from healthy controls (9.1% and −0.66 ± 0.05) to 
psychiatric controls (16.7% and −0.27 ± 0.05) to subjects with 
IED (21.8% and 1.15 ± 0.06; P ≤ .05). These findings were not 
accounted for by the presence of other syndromal/personality 
disorders or by states or traits related to depressed or anxious 
moods.
Conclusions: These data are consistent with previous studies 
suggesting a relationship between T. gondii and self-directed 
aggression (ie, suicidal behavior) and further add to the 
biological complexity of impulsive aggression both from a 
categorical and a dimensional perspective.

T. gondii Infection and Aggression
impulsive aggressive and other personality-related behaviors 
in human subjects. Subjects were recruited through public 
service, newspaper, and other media announcements 
seeking individuals who (1) reported psychosocial difficulty 
related to syndromal psychiatric and/or personality disorder 
conditions or (2) had little evidence of any psychopathology. 
All subjects gave informed consent and signed the informed 
consent document approved by the first author’s (E.F.C.) 
Institutional Review Board.
Diagnostic Assessment
Syndromal and personality disorder diagnoses were 
made according to DSM-5 criteria.25 Diagnoses were 
made using information from (1) the Structured Clinical 
Interview for DSM-IV Axis I disorders (SCID-I)26 for 
syndromal disorders and the Structured Interview for 
DSM-IV Personality (SIDP-IV)27 for personality disorders, 
(2) a clinical interview by a research psychiatrist, and (3) 
the review of all other available clinical data. The research 
diagnostic interviews were conducted by individuals with a 
master’s or doctor’s degree in clinical psychology, blinded 
to the study hypothesis. All diagnostic raters went through 
a rigorous training program that included lectures on 
DSM diagnoses and rating systems, videos of expert raters 
conducting SCID-I/SIDP-IV interviews, and practice 
interviews and ratings until the raters were deemed reliable 
by the trainer. This process resulted in good to excellent 
interrater reliabilities (mean ± SE κ = 0.84 ± 0.05; range, 
0.79 to 0.93) across anxiety, mood, substance use, impulse 
control, and personality disorders. Final diagnoses were 
assigned by team best-estimate consensus procedures28,29 
involving research psychiatrists and clinical psychologists 
as previously described.30 This methodology has been shown 
to enhance the accuracy of diagnosis over direct interview 
alone.31 Subjects with a current history of a substance use 
disorder or a life history of bipolar disorder, schizophrenia 
(or other psychotic disorder), or mental retardation were 
excluded from study.
After diagnostic assignment, 110 subjects had no evidence 
of any psychiatric diagnosis (healthy controls); 138 subjects 
met criteria for a lifetime diagnosis of a syndromal psychiatric 
or personality disorder, but not for a lifetime diagnosis of 
IED (psychiatric controls); and 110 subjects met criteria for 
a lifetime diagnosis of IED. Of the 248 subjects with any 
DSM-5 diagnosis, most (72.4%) reported (1) a history of 
formal psychiatric evaluation and/or treatment (46.3%) or 
(2) a history of behavioral disturbance during which the 
subjects, or others, thought they should have sought mental 
health services but did not (26.1%). Syndromal psychiatric 
and personality disorder diagnoses are listed in Table 1.
Psychometric Measures of Aggression,  
Impulsivity, and Related Behaviors
Aggression was assessed with the Aggression score from 
the Life History of Aggression (LHA)20 assessment and the 
Aggression (Physical and Verbal) score from the Buss-Perry 
Aggression Questionnaire (BPAQ).21 The LHA assesses the 
history of actual aggressive behavior and the BPAQ assesses 
aggressive tendencies as a personality trait. Impulsivity 
was assessed with the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale, version 
11 (BIS-11)22 and the Impulsivity scale from the Eysenck 
Personality Inventory-2 (EPQ-2).23 Both BIS-11 and EPQ-2 
Impulsivity assess a person’s disposition to act impulsively as 
a personality trait. Life history of suicidal and self-injurious 
behavior was assessed during the diagnostic interviews. An 
act was considered a suicide attempt if it involved behavior 
with the conscious (even if ambivalent) intent to die by 
means that the subject believed could end his or her life; 
an act was considered self-injurious if it involved behavior 
with the conscious (even if ambivalent) intent by the subject 
to physically harm, but not kill, himself or herself. Other 
assessments included the State-Trait Anger Expression 
Inventory-2 (STAXI-2)32 for state and trait anger, Beck 
Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II)33 for state depression, 
Depression scale from the General Behavior Inventory 
(GBI)34 for trait depression, Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI)35 
for state anxiety, and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)36 
for trait anxiety. The Global Assessment of Functioning 
(GAF)37 scale served as the variable for psychosocial 
functioning. Racial data, collected by diagnostic assessors, 
reflected self-identified racial characteristics of subjects. 
Socioeconomic status was assessed by the Hollingshead 
method (A. B. Hollingshead, Four Factor Index of Social 
Status, unpublished dissertation, 1975).

■ While limited information exists on the causes of human 
aggression, new research is pointing to inflammatory or 
infectious processes as a possible etiology.
 
■ Patients with significant histories of aggression (ie, 
intermittent explosive disorder) may have a latent 
infection with T. gondii, a common protozoan, that often 
goes undetected but is treatable.

Statistical Analysis
Comparisons of between-group variables were 
performed by χ2, univariate (ANOVA/ANCOVA), 
and multivariate analysis of variance/covariance 
(MANOVA/MANCOVA), followed by Tukey honestly 
significant difference post hoc testing. Other analyses 
included binary logistic regression using age as a 
covariate. The primary biological variable in this 
study was T. gondii seropositive status as in previous 
studies.19 The primary dimensional variables included 
composite scores for aggression and impulsivity; these 
variables were created by z-transforming each of the 2 
sets of aggression (LHA/BPAQ) and impulsivity (BIS-
11/EPQ-2) variables and taking the mean z score of 
the source variables. The primary categorical variables 
included diagnostic status (healthy controls/psychiatric 
controls/subjects with IED), positive history of 
suicide attempt, and positive history of self-injurious 
behavior. A 2-tailed α value of .05 was used to denote 
statistical significance for all analyses. The primary 
analysis tested the relationship between T. gondii 
seropositive status and composite aggression scores, 
composite impulsivity scores, and history of self-
directed aggression in all subjects. This was followed 
by analyses to determine if (1) T. gondii seropositive 
status was more frequent among IED subjects (subjects 
characterized by high levels of impulsive aggressive and 
suicidal behaviors), (2) T. gondii seropositive status 
was greater among subjects with other psychiatric and 
personality disorders, and (3) T. gondii seropositive 
individuals had higher levels of state and/or trait 
depression, anxiety, or anger.
RESULTS
Demographic Characteristics of the Sample
Healthy controls, psychiatric controls, and IED 
subjects differed only in age, with a less than 5-year age 
difference between IED subjects and healthy controls 
and a less than 3-year age difference between IED 
subjects and psychiatric controls. T. gondii seropositive 
status did not differ as a function of sex, race, or 
socioeconomic status (Table 2). As expected, the groups 
differed as a function of aggression, impulsivity, and 
history of suicidal and self-injurious behavior (Table 
2). The rate of T. gondii seropositive subjects in this 
study was 15.9%, which is comparable with the most 
recent estimate of 14.1% for the United States.9
T. gondii Seropositive Status as a Function of 
Aggression and Impulsivity
One-way ANCOVA, with age as a covariate, revealed 
that Composite Aggression scores were significantly 
higher in T. gondii seropositive subjects (F1,342 = 5.32, 
P = .022; Figure 1, left). Composite Impulsivity scores 
were also higher in T. gondii seropositive subjects 
(F1,325 = 3.83, P = .05; Figure 1, right). Composite

Asessment of T. gondii Seropositivity Status
Subjects were free of all medications for at least 4 weeks. Whole 
blood, anticoagulated with EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic 
acid), was obtained between 9 am and 11 am through venipuncture 
of a forearm vein. Plasma was processed after centrifugation, 
placed in a polypropylene tube, and stored at −80°C until assay. 
These frozen plasma samples were collected between 1991 and 
2008 and were tested for IgG antibodies to T. gondii in 2014 
by solid-phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) 
with kits from IBL (Hamburg, Germany). All samples were run 
in duplicate, and quality controls were used. The coefficient of 
intra-assay variation was less than 10%. A subject with plasma T. 
gondii IgG antibodies > 12 IU was considered to be seropositive 
for T. gondii. Equivocal samples (8–12 IUs) were reanalyzed to 
accurately classify them as negative or positive. The laboratory 
technician was not aware of the diagnostic status of the subject. 
T. gondii seropositive status, rather than serointensity, was used 
because the latter cannot be measured in seronegative subjects. 
Despite the 18-year duration of sample collection, no association 
was observed between T. gondii seropositive status and time from 
the first to last study year (Spearman ρ = 0.08, P = .12). Finally, 
plasma levels for the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin 6 
(IL-6) were available in 176 of these subjects as part of a previously 
published study.38

(B = 1.05 ± 0.47, Wald1 = 5.06, P = .025), compared with healthy 
controls. Adding Composite Aggression scores to the models 
eliminated these relationships for lifetime depressive disorder 
(B = 0.56 ± 0.50, Wald1 = 1.26, P = .263) and lifetime anxiety 
disorder (B = 0.76 ± 0.5.21, Wald1 = 2.13, P = .144).
T. gondii Seropositive Status as a  
Function of Personality Disorder
A significant difference in T. gondii seropositive status was 
also noted as a function of the presence of borderline and/or 
antisocial personality disorder compared with healthy controls 
(healthy controls, 9.1%; psychiatric controls, 18.2%; borderline 
and/or antisocial personality disorder, 20.9%; linear by linear 
association: χ21 = 5.10, P = .024); the difference with psychiatric 
controls was not significant. Binary logistic regression, with age 
as covariate, yielded a similar result that approached, but did not

Aggression scores adjusted for Composite Impulsivity 
scores continued to be higher among T. gondii 
seropositive subjects (P = .011; Figure 1, left), although 
the reverse was not true for Composite Impulsivity 
scores adjusted for Composite Aggression scores 
(P = .984; Figure 1, right). Similarly, when placed in the 
same binary logistic regression, with age as covariate, 
Composite Aggression (B = 0.44 ± 0.20, Wald1 = 4.77, 
Exp(B) = 1.55, P = .029), but not Composite Impulsivity 
(B = 0.02 ± 0.20, Wald1 = 0.08, Exp(B) = 1.06, P = .773), 
scores were associated with T. gondii seropositive status.
T. gondii Seropositive Status as a  
Function of Self-Directed Aggression
Binary logistic regression, with age as covariate, 
revealed that T. gondii seropositive status did not 
predict history of suicide attempt (20.6% vs 15.4% 
T. gondii seropositive: B = −0.26 ± 0.46, Wald1 = 0.31, 
P = .577), history of self-injurious behavior (26.9% 
vs 15.1% T. gondii seropositive: B = −0.75 ± 0.47, 
Wald1 = 2.48, P = .116), or history of either type of self-
directed aggressive behavior (24.0% vs 14.6% T. gondii 
seropositive: B = −0.58 ± 0.37, Wald1 = 2.42, P = .119).
T. gondii Seropositive Status as a Function of IED
Next, we examined the relationship between 
T. gondii seropositive status as a function of IED, 
a disorder of recurrent, problematic, impulsive 
aggressive behavior, compared with healthy controls 
and psychiatric controls. A significant difference in 
T. gondii seropositive status was noted among the 
groups (linear by linear association χ21 = 6.06, P = .014; 
Figure 2). Binary logistic regression, with age as a 
covariate, yielded the same result with IED subjects 
(B = 0.89 ± 0.41, Wald1 = 4.68, P = .030) significantly 
associated with T. gondii seropositive status compared 
with healthy controls. Psychiatric controls were not 
significantly associated with T. gondii seropositive 
status compared with healthy controls (B = −0.63 ± 0.41, 
Wald1 = 2.42, P = .120). Increasing T. gondii seropositive 
status paralleled mean Composite Aggression (and 
Composite Impulsivity) scores, adjusted for age, across 
the groups (Figure 2). Adding Composite Aggression 
scores to the model eliminated the relationship for T. 
gondii seropositive status for IED subjects, compared 
with healthy controls (B = 0.26 ± 0.63, Wald1 = 0.18, 
P = .675).
T. gondii Seropositive Status as a  
Function of Non-IED Syndromal Disorders
A significant difference in T. gondii seropositive 
status was also noted as a function of lifetime depressive 
disorder and lifetime anxiety disorder, but not lifetime 
substance use disorder. Binary logistic regression, with 
age as covariate, yielded similar results for subjects 
with depressive disorder (B = 0.79 ± 0.42, Wald1 = 3.51, 
P = .061) and subjects with anxiety disorder

reach, statistical significance (B = 0.85 ± 0.45, Wald1 = 3.47, 
P = .062). Adding Composite Aggression scores to the model 
eliminated this relationship (B = 0.32 ± 0.60, Wald1 = 0.29, 
P = .592). Expanding this analysis to include all personality 
disorders resulted in the same observation with respect 
to psychiatric controls having a higher rate of T. gondii 
seropositive status compared with healthy controls; this 
finding was nonsignificant after the addition of Composite 
Aggression scores to the model.
T. gondii Seropositive Status as a Function  
of State and Trait Dysphoric Moods: Anger,  
Depression, and Anxiety
ANCOVA, with age as covariate, revealed higher state 
and trait anger scores as a function of T. gondii seropositive 
status (Figure 3, left). Similar analysis using state and 
trait depression and anxiety scores, however, revealed no 
significant differences as a function of T. gondii seropositive 
status (Figure 3, center and right).
Circulating IL-6 Levels as a  
Function of T. gondii Seropositive Status
ANCOVA, with age as covariate, revealed no difference in 
circulating levels of IL-6 as a function of T. gondii seropositive 
status in the subgroup in which these data were available 
(T. gondii seropositive: 0.98 ± 1.64 pg/mL vs T. gondii 
seronegative: 1.41 ± 1.67 pg/mL; F1,172 = 1.27, P = .262). As 
previously reported, IL-6 (log IL-6: r = –0.39, P < .001) levels 
were inversely correlated with Composite Aggression scores 
in the subjects in this study.39
DISCUSSION
The results of this study suggest a relationship between 
latent infection with T. gondii and impulsive aggression from 
both a dimensional and categorical perspective. Specifically, 
T. gondii seropositive status was associated with higher 
scores on the psychometric measures for both Aggression 
and Impulsivity. Between aggression and impulsivity, 
these data suggest that T. gondii seropositive status is 
primarily related to aggression than to impulsivity in that 
the variance associated with impulsivity overlaps with the 
variance associated with aggression. In addition, the rate 
of T. gondii seropositivity in IED subjects was significantly 
greater than that in healthy controls, though not significantly 
greater than that in psychiatric controls without IED. The 
nonsignificant difference in seropositivity rate between 
IED subjects and psychiatric controls may be due to the 
fact that Aggression scores in psychiatric controls were 
intermediate between healthy controls and IED subjects, that 
this sample did not have the power to detect this difference 
to a statistically significant degree, or that other behaviors, 
such as depression or anxiety, are also associated with latent 
toxoplasmosis. These results are supported by findings from 
animal studies39 that showed a relationship between T. gondii 
infection and elevated aggression-related behaviors and a 
recent study19 of 1,000 psychiatrically healthy subjects that 
documented elevated trait aggression and impulsivity as a 
function of T. gondii seropositivity.
Typically, other-directed aggression is strongly associated 
with self-directed aggressive behavior in psychiatric 
subjects,18 and greater rates of T. gondii seropositive status 
have been reported among those with a history of suicidal 
behavior.11–15 Despite these previous findings, we did not 
find an association between T. gondii seropositive status and 
self-directed aggression in our sample. The proportion of 
subjects with lifetime histories of suicidal or self-injurious 
behavior was small, however, and the present study had 
limited statistical power to detect relationships reported 
from previous, and larger, samples. It is also possible that the 
psychiatric diagnostic composition of the sample (psychiatric 
controls) and tendency to direct aggression outward (IED) 
reduced an association with suicidal self-directed aggression. 
Consistently, in the largest study14 on T. gondii seropositive 
status and suicidal self-directed violence, performed on a 
cohort of Danish women, the association was significantly 
weaker in those women who had a concurrent diagnosis of 
mood disorder, psychotic disorder, or personality disorder.
Individuals with a lifetime history of depressive 
and anxiety disorder also had higher rates of T. gondii 
seropositive status compared with healthy controls. While 
higher depression and anxiety scores should be observed 
as a function of T. gondii seropositive status, no significant 
differences in state or trait scores for depression or anxiety 
were observed. The observed effect size for depression 
or anxiety scores was modest (d = 0.10 to 0.20), and it is 
possible that a larger sample would have yielded different 
results. However, studies in much larger samples report no 
significant association between T. gondii seropositive status 
and unipolar major depression or dysthymia,9 generalized 
anxiety disorder, panic disorder, or posttraumatic stress 
disorder,39 suggesting that mood and anxiety disorders are 
not accounting for the findings in our study. In contrast, 
composite aggression and state and trait anger scores were 
aTo place all symptom measures on the same scale, z scores were used.

T. gondii Infection and Aggression
significantly elevated as a function of T. gondii seropositive 
status and, in every case, eliminated all differences as a 
function of T. gondii seropositive status. Thus, we posit 
that the higher T. gondii seropositive rates observed in 
individuals with depressive/anxiety disorder, compared with 
healthy controls, were due to their comorbidity with IED or 
a correlation between aggression, depression, and anxiety 
scores. In the current sample, IED was highly comorbid 
with lifetime depressive disorder (64% vs 35%, P < .001), 
and aggression scores correlated with both trait depression 
(r = 0.38, P = .001) and anxiety (r = 0.52, P < .001) scores, 
though not as strongly as depression correlated with anxiety 
(r = 0.74, P < .001).
Several factors may account for these findings. First, 
chronic latent infection with T. gondii may lead to a low-
grade chronic immune activation within the brain, with 
(or without) downstream effects on neurotransmitter 
systems involved in aggressive behavior.40 Second, chronic 
T. gondii infection may alter the structure and function 
of corticolimbic circuits that are known to modulate 
impulsive aggressive behavior.41 Specifically, persistent T. 
gondii infection in mice is associated with neuronal tissue 
lesions, altered neuronal function, ventricular dilation, 
and neuroinflammation.42 In addition, several, though not 
all, studies suggest that T. gondii–containing cysts localize 
primarily in the prefrontal cortex and amygdala43,44 and that 
latent infection with T. gondii induces dendritic retraction in 
the basolateral amygdala.45 Third, as shown experimentally 
in rats,46 T. gondii infection increases testicular expression 
of genes involved in the production of testosterone. In 
addition, there is evidence that T. gondii–infected males, 
though not females, have higher circulating levels of 
testosterone compared with controls.47 However, while a 
number of studies report a relationship between elevated 
levels of testosterone and aggression,48 the magnitude of this 
relationship is small. Thus, it is unlikely that testosterone 
plays any more than a modest role in this regard.
Neurotransmitter mechanisms by which T. gondii 
may affect behavior include effects on serotonergic and 
glutaminergic transmission, both of which have been shown 
to play a role in aggressive behavior in human studies.49,50 
Relevant to serotonin, conversion of tryptophan to 
kynurenine is controlled by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 
([IDO]; IDO-1 and IDO-2).51 Since IDO can be activated by 
inflammatory cytokines, levels of kynurenine can rise while 
levels of serotonin decline. In addition, increased levels of 
kynurenine lead to increased levels of its active metabolite 
quinolinic acid, a potent N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor 
agonist, which may increase the risk for aggressive behavior 
in humans.50 While this hypothesis is partially supported by 
reported elevations of kynurenine and quinolinic acid levels 
in mice with chronic T. gondii infection,52 we did not find 
differences in circulating levels of proinflammatory cytokines 
(ie, IL-6) as a function of T. gondii seropositivity. It is possible 
that the proinflammatory processes that keep T. gondii in a 
latent state are confined to the brain and are not reflected in 
the periphery. It is also possible that impulsively aggressive 
individuals engage in behaviors that increase their own 
risk of infection with T. gondii or that latent toxoplasmosis 
changes behavior, as in felids,1 so that the expression of 
aggression is increased. In addition, T. gondii is known to 
increase risk-taking behavior in rodents, evolutionarily 
benefiting the parasite (ie, transforming natural aversion 
in cats to attraction).53,54 This is an example of the general 
phenomenon of host manipulation by parasites, documented 
in nature,55 and proposed as a model with some explanatory 
potential for alterations in human behavior associated with 
parasitic infections.56,57
The strengths of this hypothesis-driven study include 
a well-characterized sample of healthy and psychiatric 
controls as well as validated measures of aggression, 
impulsivity, depression, and anxiety. Limitations to our study 
are present, as well. First, we used a cross-sectional design, 
and no causal, or directional, conclusions can be made from 
these analyses. Second, ascertainment of subjects may limit 
the generalizability of these findings in that these involved 
subjects who volunteered for a research study, rather than 
for clinical treatment. However, nearly three-quarters of the 
psychiatric subjects reported a past history of psychiatric 
treatment (or of having episodes of behavioral disturbance 
for which they, or others, thought they should have sought 
mental health services but did not), and, thus, most of these 
subjects are likely similar to individuals who would have been 
recruited from a clinical setting. Third, it is possible that the 
presented associations are nonspecific and, instead, due to 
other common latency-establishing neurotropic pathogens 
such as herpes viruses or cytomegalovirus. However, recent 
studies have documented that associations between T. gondii 
and self-directed58 and other-directed19 aggression in human 
subjects are not due to the presence of these other potential 
pathogens. Finally, because immunoglobulin M antibodies 
to T. gondii were not assessed, there is a possibility that a 
small number of seropositive subjects had an acute, rather 
than a chronic latent, infection at time of study.
In summary, we report a greater rate of T. gondii 
seropositive status in subjects with DSM-5 IED compared 
with healthy controls and a positive relationship with 
aggression and anger, but not with depression or anxiety. 
These findings are consistent with previous T. gondii 
seropositive status data, suggesting a relationship with self-
directed aggression (ie, suicidal behavior) and a relationship 
involving schizophrenia or mania—disorders in which many 
individuals are often aggressive.59,60 Our results further add 
to the biological complexity of impulsive aggression, from 
both a categorical and a dimensional perspective.
