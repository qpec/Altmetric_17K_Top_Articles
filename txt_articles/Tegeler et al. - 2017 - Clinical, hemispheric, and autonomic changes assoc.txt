Abstract
Background: The objective of this pilot study was to explore the use of a closed-loop, allostatic, acoustic stimulation
neurotechnology for individuals with self-reported symptoms of post-traumatic stress, as a potential means to impact
symptomatology, temporal lobe high frequency asymmetry, heart rate variability (HRV), and baroreflex sensitivity (BRS).
Methods: From a cohort of individuals participating in a naturalistic study to evaluate use of allostatic neurotechnology
for diverse clinical conditions, a subset was identified who reported high scores on the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder
Checklist (PCL). The intervention entailed a series of sessions wherein brain electrical activity was monitored noninvasively
at high spectral resolutions, with software algorithms translating selected brain frequencies into acoustic stimuli (audible
tones) that were delivered back to the user in real time, to support auto-calibration of neural oscillations. Participants
completed symptom inventories before and after the intervention, and a subset underwent short-term blood pressure
recordings for HRV and BRS. Changes in temporal lobe high frequency asymmetry were analyzed from baseline
assessment through the first four sessions, and for the last four sessions.
Results: Nineteen individuals (mean age 47, 11 women) were enrolled, and the majority also reported symptom scores
that exceeded inventory thresholds for depression. They undertook a median of 16 sessions over 16.5 days, and 18
completed the number of sessions recommended. After the intervention, 89% of the completers reported clinically
significant decreases in post-traumatic stress symptoms, indicated by a change of at least 10 points on the PCL. At a
group level, individuals with either rightward (n = 7) or leftward (n = 7) dominant baseline asymmetry in temporal lobe
high frequency (23–36 Hz) activity demonstrated statistically significant reductions in their asymmetry scores over the
course of their first four sessions. For 12 individuals who underwent short-term blood pressure recordings, there were
statistically significant increases in HRV in the time domain and BRS (Sequence Up). There were no adverse events.
Conclusion: Closed-loop, allostatic neurotechnology for auto-calibration of neural oscillations appears promising as an
innovative therapeutic strategy for individuals with symptoms of post-traumatic stress.

 Background
By most measures, there is room for improvement in the
healthcare of individuals with symptoms of post-traumatic
stress. Expert consensus statements in the last decade
have held that psychotherapies for posttraumatic stress
disorder (PTSD), based on controlled re-exposure to the
traumatic event, are the most evidence-based treatment
[1, 2]. However there are persisting concerns about this
modality due to high rates of non-response and dropout
[3–5]. Moreover, sleep disturbance is a core feature of
PTSD [6] and a predictor of worse global functionality [7],
yet sleep improvement is typically elusive after completion
of PTSD-specific behavioral therapies [8, 9]. While SSRI
and other medication prescriptions are common, the
overall evidence for the efficacy of psychopharmacological
agents for individuals with PTSD is generally considered
to be modest at best [1, 10]. Editorialists have affirmed
that “New innovative and engaging approaches for the
treatment of PTSD are needed” [11].
Recently, a bihemispheric autonomic model (BHAM)
has been proposed as an integrative approach to under-
standing the effects of traumatic stress on health and be-
havior [12, 13]. The BHAM begins by recognizing that the
right and left hemispheres have differential responsibility
for management of efferent sympathetic and parasympa-
thetic activity, respectively, and this division of labor is
represented most prominently at the bilateral insular cor-
tices [14], which are deep to the temporal lobes. The
BHAM
posits
that
traumatic
stress
(physical
or
emotional) can produce a risk for the development of
dominant and maladaptive asymmetries of brain activity
in homologous regions of the hemispheres (insulae and
elsewhere) that are involved with downstream regulation
of the autonomic nervous system (ANS). Specifically, the
experience of an activating traumatic stress may increase
the risk for rightward dominant asymmetry that produces
an autonomic bias for sympathetic fight-flight physiology.
Repeated stressors – or a single overwhelming stress –
may increase the risk for leftward dominant asymmetry
that produces a parasympathetic freeze state, which may
be associated with emotional numbing or dissociation.
The model’s attention to lateralized cortical manage-
ment of the ANS aligns with the transdiagnostic, dimen-
sional, and brain-based perspective that is encouraged
by the RDoC initiative [15], and this focus can integrate
findings which might have otherwise unappreciated rela-
tionships. For example, the BHAM predicts the observa-
tion that PTSD is associated with a range of physical
health disorders [16–18] including, effectively, acceler-
ated physiological aging [19]. While the role of the ANS
for mediating adverse behavioral and health states tends
to be systematically under-recognized in clinical medi-
cine [20], numerous researchers have used the metrics
of heart rate variability (HRV) and baroreflex sensitivity
(BRS), which are indicators of the capacity of the para-
sympathetic division to buffer sympathetic arousal, as a
window on neural regulation of the cardiovascular sys-
tem. Studies consistently show that HRV and BRS are
diminished in patients with PTSD [21–25].
Furthermore, the BHAM encourages new thinking in the
domain of therapeutic strategy. A thesis of the model is that
relative symmetry in the activity of bilateral cerebral hemi-
spheric regions responsible for management of the auto-
nomic nervous system (i.e. insulae and other regions of
temporal cortex) is likely to be characterized by a state of
relative autonomic optimality, associated with relatively
small and healthy fluctuations between leftward and right-
ward asymmetry of activity in those regions. A corollary is
that there may be value to interventions that can facilitate
brain activity to calibrate away from maladaptive forms of
hemispheric asymmetry, toward symmetry. Attenuation of
rightward dominance in temporal lobe high frequency
asymmetry has been reported from use of allostatic neuro-
technology in individuals with insomnia, with a trend for
reduction in asymmetry score to be associated with reduc-
tion in symptoms of sleep disturbance [26].
The objective of the present study was to evaluate the
effects of closed-loop, allostatic, acoustic stimulation
neurotechnology on clinical symptoms, temporal lobe
high frequency electrical asymmetry, and autonomic car-
diovascular regulation (HRV and BRS), in a case series
of individuals with self-reported symptoms of post-
traumatic stress. We hypothesized that use of the inter-
vention would be associated with decreased levels of
symptomatology, decreased temporal lobe high fre-
quency electrical asymmetry, and improvements in para-
sympathetic
measures
of
autonomic
cardiovascular
regulation. Temporal lobe asymmetry was chosen be-
cause of predictions associated with the BHAM, and a
high frequency range of electrical activity was chosen in
consideration of potential associations between trauma,
sleep disturbance, and increased activity in this range
[27, 28]. Secondarily we explored for possible relation-
ships between baseline temporal lobe high frequency
asymmetry, symptom severity, and heart rate variability.
Changes in insomnia symptomatology and neurophysio-
logical hyperarousal demonstrated by these individuals
are reported elsewhere.
Methods
Participants
Participants were drawn from an ongoing, open label,
exploratory protocol whose objective has been to identify
clinical cohorts that may benefit from use of allostatic
neurotechnology. The study is a single site IRB-approved
project, carried out in the Department of Neurology at
Wake Forest School of Medicine in Winston-Salem,
North Carolina, USA. Participants with one or more

 neurological, cardiovascular, or psychophysiological condi-
tions have been enrolled through clinician referrals and
informal networks, producing a relatively open sampling
frame that can support the advance of transdiagnostic
clinical neuroscience research [15]. Exclusions are physical
disability to attend study visits, known seizure disorders,
total hearing impairment bilaterally, or ongoing use of
benzodiazepine, opiate or anti-psychotic medications. Of
152 participants enrolled in the open label study between
August 11, 2011 and April 28, 2014, nineteen participants
reported a history of exposure to a traumatic stressor and
identified symptoms related to post-traumatic stress as
the primary reason for enrollment, and they comprise the
cohort for the present report. Individuals met DSM-IV-TR
[29] symptom criteria for PTSD on the basis of self-
reported scores on PCL-C domains, rating “moderately”
or above to at least one “B” item (intrusive recollection),
at least three “C” items (avoidant/numbing), and at least
two “D” items (hyperarousal). All nineteen participants
reported more than one month duration of symptoms.
Neurotechnology-guided strategy for allostatic
auto-calibration of neural oscillations
The intervention entailed use of a closed-loop, allostatic
acoustic stimulation neurotechnology, intended to support
auto-calibration of neural oscillations (High-resolution, re-
lational, resonance-based, electroencephalic mirroring, or
HIRREM®
[26];
Brain
State Technologies,
Scottsdale,
Arizona). HIRREM entails recording of brain electrical
activity from scalp-based sensors, computer-guided algo-
rithmic analysis of neural oscillatory frequencies for transla-
tion into sonic frequencies, and the return of acoustic
signals back to the brain in real time (through the periph-
eral auditory nervous system). Procedures for the interven-
tion have been discussed in detail previously [26]. Each
participant began with a baseline assessment (45 min) to
evaluate patterns of activity in the brain electrical frequency
spectrum with respect to hemispheric symmetry, and ratios
of energy across frequencies ranging from 0 to 48 Hz. The
assessment consisted of two-channel recordings of brain
electrical activity from at least six paired locations on the
scalp (F3/F4, C3/C4, T3/T4, P3/P4, O1/O2, FZ/OZ; refer-
enced to ears, linked), with the recipient at rest and while
carrying out a task, using sensors and amplifiers (Brain
State Technologies, Scottsdale, Arizona) that sample at
256 Hz. Recordings were conducted at each location with
eyes closed (one minute), eyes partially open to permit
transition in arousal state (one minute), and eyes open
(one minute while performing a mental task, e.g. recalling
numbers, reading a passage, etc.). Trained technologists
evaluated assessment data to choose protocols for the ini-
tial intervention session. Protocols consisted of recording
brain electrical activity through generally two channels,
with sensors placed at homologous regions of the
hemispheres (F3/F4, C3/C4, T3/T4, P3/P4, O1/O2, Fp1/
Fp2) and also other locations depending on the judgment
of the technologist. In real time, software algorithms ana-
lyzed specific ranges of the brain electrical frequency
spectrum, identified dominant frequencies on the basis of
proprietary mathematical formulae, and translated those
frequencies to acoustic stimuli (audible tones of variable
pitch and timing) which were presented to participants
through standard earphones (Creative EP-630 or Sony
Stereo Headphones MDR-EX58V) with as little as an eight
millisecond delay. Volume (decibels) of acoustic stimula-
tion was adjusted by each participant in accordance with
their preference. The initial and subsequent sessions
(approximately 90 min each) consisted of four to ten
protocols (five to forty minutes each), some done with
eyes closed and some with eyes open, with the participant
being asked to relax while sitting or reclining comfortably
in a zero-gravity chair. Specific protocols for successive
sessions were chosen based on brain electrical data from
the preceding session, which for purposes of technologist
review was aggregated in broad-band frequency ranges
(Hz; <1.0, 1.0–3.0, 3.0–5.5, 5.5–7.5, 7.5–10.0, 10.0–12.0,
12.0–15.0, 15.0–23.0, 23.0–36.0, 36.0–48.0). Brain regions
were chosen with special attention to patterns of activity
suggestive of dominant hemispheric asymmetries and/or
suboptimal ratios of energy across the frequency spectrum
[26]. Algorithms are designed to support de-establishment
of relatively invariant and potentially maladaptive activity
patterns. Participants generally completed two sessions in
a half day, separated by a 20–30 min break. The decision
for the total number of sessions to be received was based
on impressions of clinical improvement or plateau, includ-
ing evaluation of the participants’ brain pattern evolution
over the course of their sessions, as well as the partici-
pants’ schedules and preferences. All participants contin-
ued with their usual medical or behavioral care. As a
closed-loop strategy [30], HIRREM is explicitly designed
to depend on brain activity as such, as opposed to the
volition or learning skills of the client. Furthermore it is
aligned with the allostasis model of physiological regula-
tion, which recognizes the significance of neural regula-
tion across organ systems, and the dependence of
biological system functionality on the changing features of
the local context [31–34].
Measures of temporal lobe high frequency electrical
asymmetry
One-minute epochs of brain electrical activity data from
bilateral temporal lobes (T3 and T4 locations in the 10–
20 International EEG system) were collected from the
assessment and a temporal lobe exercise from each of
the first four and final four sessions, in order to permit
comparisons of activity from the early and latter phases
of the intervention, for individuals who had differing
Tegeler et al. BMC Psychiatry  (2017) 17:141 
Page 3 of 11
 numbers of total sessions. For each session, two epochs
were analyzed, the first and the penultimate minute of
the session. The penultimate minute was used to avoid
potential recording artifacts related to completion of the
final seconds of a given exercise (e.g. muscular contrac-
tions as participants became more alert). Tracings of
amplitudes in ten frequency ranges (see Section 2.2)
were visually inspected for sustained spikes or drops in
amplitudes and cross-referenced with technologist ses-
sion notes, to remove data that were considered to be
potentially indicative of sensor displacement. Temporal
lobe high frequency (23–36 Hz) asymmetry scores were
calculated for each epoch by subtracting average ampli-
tude at T3 from average amplitude at T4 and dividing
by the lesser of the two. A positive asymmetry score
indicates T4-dominance and a negative asymmetry score
T3-dominance. On the basis of an a priori hypothesis
about the significance of rightward versus leftward
asymmetry in temporal lobe electrical activity [12], par-
ticipants were divided into three groups according to
their asymmetry scores at baseline assessment – T4
dominant (≥10%), T3 dominant (≤ − 10%), or balanced
(absolute value < 10%). For each dominance group,
change in asymmetry during the initial and latter stages
of the intervention was evaluated in an exploratory way
as follows. The slope of a fitted line was determined over
the initial assessment and first four sessions, and the last
four sessions, based on the median asymmetry scores
over the course of those sessions. In order to assess
whether these fitted lines reflected a tendency for change
in asymmetry score, indicated as a positive or negative
slope, a one-sample linear regression t-test was per-
formed on each slope, with the null hypothesis being
that it was zero. It should be noted that although
this technique is common for interpreting the significance
of a trend line, the underlying data consisted of median
values for asymmetry scores and entailed intra-subject cor-
relations, and thus the probability of randomness (p value)
generated by this statistical test is best considered explora-
tory. Statistical tests were performed using SAS software
version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina, USA).
Symptom inventories for post-traumatic stress and
depression
The Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PCL-C;
[35]) measures symptoms that may pertain to any trau-
matic life experience, and includes PTSD criteria B, C, &
D measures from the DSM-IV-TR. Those with prior
military service also completed the military version
(PCL-M), which was used for reporting in the present
paper. Seventeen items are rated on a Likert scale with a
composite score range of 17–85, and a score of 44 or
greater indicates a high likelihood for PTSD diagnosis
[36]. A decrease of 10 points or greater in the PCL-C is
considered a clinically significant improvement [37], and
group-level change in PCL score was also analyzed
through a paired t-test. Symptoms of depressive mood
were evaluated by either the Center for Epidemiologic
Studies Depression Scale (CES-D; [38]), or the Beck De-
pression Inventory (BDI; [39]). CESD scores range from
0 to 60, with a score of 16 or greater commonly used to
indicate risk for clinically relevant depressive symptom-
atology. BDI scores range from 0 to 63, yielding classifi-
cation of minimal depression (0–13), mild depression
(14–19),
moderate
depression
(20–28),
and
severe
depression (29–63; [40]), and a score of 14 or greater
was used as the threshold value. Post-HIRREM symptom
data were collected within two weeks of the final
HIRREM session.
Assessment of heart rate variability and baroreflex
sensitivity
For twelve subjects, short-term (5 min, 1000 Hz) con-
tinuous blood pressure and heart rate recordings (BIO-
PAC,
Santa
Barbara,
CA)
were
collected
under
conditions of spontaneous breathing, within thirty mi-
nutes prior to the baseline HIRREM assessment, and
within two weeks after completing the final HIRREM
session. Heart rate variability (HRV) was assessed as the
standard deviation of the NN interval (SDNN) in the
time domain and as the absolute values of the low and
high frequency components. Baroreflex sensitivity (BRS)
was assessed by the sequence method (Nevrokard BRS,
Nevrokard Kiauta, Izola, Slovenia). Measures of auto-
nomic cardiovascular regulation are presented as pre
and post-HIRREM values and percentage differences,
and comparisons were made using paired t-tests.
Relationships between temporal lobe high frequency
asymmetry, heart rate variability, and clinical symptoms
Exploratory analysis was performed to detect possible re-
lationships between temporal lobe high frequency elec-
trical asymmetry and symptom severity or heart rate
variability (SDNN). Each individual’s baseline SDNN value
(when available) was plotted as a function of the temporal
lobe high frequency asymmetry score from their HIRREM
assessment, using a second-order polynomial regression
equation. Similar analyses were conducted to detect pos-
sible relationships between temporal lobe high frequency
asymmetry and the symptom inventory scores.
Results
Participants’ baseline characteristics, number of HIRREM
sessions received, and scores on the PCL before and after
the intervention are shown in Table 1. Mean age was
47 years (SD 14.9), 58% were women, and they reported a
median of 3.5 years (range 3 months to 50 years) of symp-
toms after a traumatic event. All reported a history of

 multiple health conditions. 18 subjects provided both pre-
and post-intervention data for the PCL and CES-D/BDI
inventories. At baseline 95% reported symptom levels for
depressive mood that exceeded the threshold for potential
clinical significance. Participants received a median of 16
(range 6 to 26) HIRREM sessions over a median of
16.5 days (range 9 to 184), with a median of 8 days (range
5 to 14) of visits to the office to receive sessions. One par-
ticipant elected to discontinue before the follow-up data
collection visit, citing a lack of motivation and a prefer-
ence to resume a previously discontinued medication regi-
men. After the intervention, 89% reported decreases of at
least 10 points on the PCL, and as a group the mean
change in their PCL scores was −24.1 (p < .0001). 33%
exceeded the threshold values for depressive symptom-
atology. There were no adverse events.
Changes in temporal lobe high frequency (23–36 Hz)
electrical asymmetry are shown in Figs. 1 and 2. For the
group of individuals who were rightward (T4) dominant
(≥10%) at baseline, the slope of the trend line from the
assessment through the first four sessions was negative
(p = .023), indicating movement toward greater sym-
metry. Conversely, the group of individuals who were
leftward (T3) dominant (≤ − 10%) at baseline demon-
strated a positive slope in the trend line (p = .015) for
their early sessions, also indicating movement toward
greater symmetry. No statistically significant change in
the asymmetry scores was shown for the group that
did not have dominant asymmetry at baseline (<10%
in either direction) over their early sessions, or for
any of the groups over their final four sessions. For
illustrative purposes, bilateral temporal lobe spectro-
graphs for activity at baseline and during the penulti-
mate

of
the
fourth
HIRREM
session
are
shown for individuals whose baseline asymmetry was
rightward (Fig. 3) and leftward (Fig. 4).

 for measures of autonomic cardiovascular regulation are
shown in Table 2. There were statistically significant
increases in heart rate variability as measured in the time
domain (SDNN) and baroreflex sensitivity (Sequence Up –
indicative of lengthening of the RR interval with increasing
blood pressure). Exploratory analysis demonstrated a sig-
nificant negative correlation between rightward temporal
lobe high frequency asymmetry at baseline assessment and
SDNN (F-test p = .0014), as shown in Fig. 5. There was no
statistically significant relationship between temporal lobe
high frequency asymmetry and symptom scores for post-
traumatic stress or depression (data not shown).
Discussion
In this case series, individuals with self-reported symp-
toms of post-traumatic stress undertook use of an allo-
static neurotechnology for closed-loop auto-calibration
of neural oscillations. After completing a series of
sessions, the majority of participants reported clinically
significant
reductions
in
their
symptoms
of
post-
traumatic stress and depressive mood. Analysis of high-
frequency (23–36 Hz) brain electrical activity patterns at
the bilateral temporal lobes showed that at a group level,
those who had either rightward or leftward asymmetry
at their baseline assessment became more symmetrical
over their first four sessions. In a subset of the partici-
pants for whom short-term blood pressure recordings
were collected, statistically significant improvements
were demonstrated in HRV in the time domain as well
as BRS, suggesting increased parasympathetic capacity.
The intervention was well tolerated, with 18 of 19

 participants completing their course of sessions as rec-
ommended by the provider team.
The present findings are consistent with earlier studies
reporting reductions in temporal lobe high frequency
asymmetry, improvements in heart rate variability, or
both, in the course of allostatic neurotechnology usage
by adults with insomnia [41], adolescents with postural
orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS; [42]), and
athletes with persisting post-concussion symptoms [43].
Other neurotechnologies proposed for treatment of
PTSD include stimulatory techniques such as transcra-
nial magnetic stimulation (TMS; [44]) and transcranial
direct current stimulation (TDCS; [45]), which are open-
loop approaches in that they do not record brain activity
before delivering successive cycles of their intervention.
EEG operant conditioning [46–48] is a form of reward-
based training to achieve conscious self-management of
brain rhythms (“learner-in-the-loop”), and a recent study
found that receiving 40 sessions was associated with a
significant but incomplete degree of PTSD symptom re-
duction [48].
The negative correlation at baseline between rightward
temporal high frequency asymmetry and HRV is consist-
ent with a report on the larger and more heterogeneous
sample from which this case series was drawn [49],
which contended that temporal lobe high frequency
electrical asymmetry holds promise as a physiological
unit of analysis for the RDoC domain of arousal. In

 contrast, the absence of a relationship between this metric
and post-traumatic stress symptom severity gives prelim-
inary indication that it is unlikely to be sufficient as a
stand-alone biomarker of clinical PTSD status. This as-
sessment is tempered by recognition that the participants
had numerous comorbid health conditions which may
have had independent effects on their asymmetry patterns.
Others have reported that state-dependent brain electrical
asymmetry during trauma-relevant stimulation is more
likely than trait asymmetry under neutral conditions, to
identify individuals with PTSD [50, 51].
Prima facie, we interpret the reduction in temporal lobe
high frequency asymmetry over the first four sessions as a
reflection of auto-calibration of neural oscillations [26]. In
conjunction with the increased HRV and BRS that were
demonstrated after completion of the sessions, the move-
ment toward symmetry is consistent with a thesis of the
BHAM that was noted in the Introduction. Increasing sym-
metry in temporal lobe high frequency electrical activity
may have represented enhanced, centrally-directed, para-
sympathetic modulation of sympathetic arousal. If an effect
on the core biology of autonomic regulation is shown to be
durable and replicable in future studies, it would represent
a genuine therapeutic advance. To date, there have been re-
ports of improved HRV in patients with PTSD in associ-
ation with usage of fluoxetine [52], behavioral therapy [53],
HRV biofeedback [54], and eye movement desensitization
and reprocessing [55]; other recent studies in military
service members with PTSD have found that mindfulness
meditation had no impact on HRV [56], and escitalopram
was associated with HRV reduction [57].
An important limitation to the present study derives
from its case series design and the absence of a control
group. Above all, it could be conjectured that the results
were primarily due to subjective expectation for benefit,
positive provider-client interactions, regression to the
mean, natural history of disease, or a combination of these
factors. Nonetheless the physiological changes in temporal
lobe electrical asymmetry and autonomic cardiovascular
regulation tend to stand against this explanation, consider-
ing that placebo interventions in clinical research are less
likely to impact objective outcome measures [58]. An add-
itional limitation of the study is that the participant selec-
tion was based on their self-reported history and score on
the PCL, and did not include a clinician assessment.
Conclusion
In conclusion, this study found that individuals with self-
reported symptoms of post-traumatic stress who under-
took use of a closed-loop, allostatic, acoustic stimulation
neurotechnology, reported significant reductions in clin-
ical symptomatology that were accompanied by reductions
in temporal lobe high frequency electrical asymmetry, and
increased HRV and BRS. These improvements, in con-
junction with the absence of adverse events or significant
drop-outs, suggest that neurotechnology-assisted auto-
calibration of neural oscillations holds promise as an
innovative therapeutic strategy for individuals with symp-
toms related to post-traumatic stress.
