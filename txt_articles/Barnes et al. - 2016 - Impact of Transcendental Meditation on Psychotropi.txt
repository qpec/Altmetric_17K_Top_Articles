ABSTRACT
The purpose of the study was to determine whether the regular practice of Transcendental Meditation
(TM) decreased the need for psychotropic medications required for anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
management and increased psychological wellbeing. The sample included 74 military Service Members with docu-
mented PTSD or anxiety disorder not otherwise specified (ADNOS), 37 that practiced TM and 37 that did not. At
1 month, 83.7% of the TM group stabilized, decreased, or ceased medications and 10.8% increased medication dosage;
compared with 59.4% of controls that showed stabilizations, decreases, or cessations; and 40.5% that increased medica-
tions ( p < 0.03). A similar pattern was observed after 2 ( p < 0.27), 3 ( p < 0.002), and 6 months ( p < 0.34). Notably,
there was a 20.5% difference between groups in severity of psychological symptoms after 6 months, that is, the control
group experienced an increase in symptom severity compared with the group practicing TM. These findings provide
insight into the benefits of TM as a viable treatment modality in military treatment facilities for reducing PTSD and
ADNOS psychological symptoms and associated medication use.
INTRODUCTION
The prevalence of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in
infantry groups deployed to Operations Enduring Freedom
and Iraqi Freedom is 13.2%, based on studies conducted by
the U.S. Army.1 With an increasing number of military Ser-
vice Members suffering from anxiety disorders and PTSD as a
result of combat trauma and multiple deployments, the impor-
tance of effective, evidence-based interventions has become
a central theme in the military behaviorial health commu-
nity.2 Seeking behavior health care is stigmatized within the
military community and may have a negative impact on
career advancement.3 For those who seek treatment, current
treatment protocols often fail to address the wide spectrum
of neurocognitive health concerns associated with PTSD and
Anxiety Disorder Not-Otherwise-Specified (ADNOS).3
Evidence-based treatments such as Prolonged Exposure
(PE), Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT), and Eye Move-
ment Desensitization and Reprocessing are the recognized
first-line treatments for combat-related PTSD and ADNOS.4
Although these interventions are associated with significant
reductions in PTSD symptoms, they do not extinguish them
completely.4 Psychotropic medications, especially the selec-
tive serotonin reuptake inhibitors, are also used for PTSD
and ADNOS, but the response rate is low with less than
30% experiencing complete symptom cessation.5 Treatment
success may also be limited by complicated comorbidities
such as traumatic brain injury, substance abuse, sleep and
mood disorders. These limitations highlight the need for
further solutions.
The Transcendental Meditation (TM) program has been
recommended for improving soldier resilience,6 and may be
a viable adjunctive treatment option for PTSD and ADNOS.
The TM technique is a simple, natural, self-guided proce-
dure that is practiced 20 minutes twice daily, sitting comfort-
ably with eyes closed, at a convenient time each morning
and afternoon.7 During the practice, thinking processes settle
down, and a wakeful hypometabolic state characterized by
neural coherence and physiological rest is gained.8,9 The
practice of TM has shown a wide range of health benefits,10
including reductions in blood pressure,11,12 use of antihyperten-
sive medications,13 sympathetic nervous system activation,14
and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.10 A systematic
review of 14 randomized clinical trials examining anxiety show
TM to be more effective than usual care with the greatest
effects on those with high anxiety.15 A review of meditation
studies also supports the safety and potential efficacy of medi-
tative practices as treatments for medical illness, particularly in
nonpsychotic mood and anxiety disorders.16
Preliminary findings for reducing PTSD symptomatology
through TM suggested the worth of this intervention to practi-
tioners in the military health care community.17,18 A 3-month
trial randomly assigned Vietnam veterans to either TM or
psychotherapeutic treatment for PTSD. Compared with the
control group participants who received only psychotherapy,
the subjects who practiced TM experienced significant reduc-
tions in PTSD symptoms, including emotional numbness,
depression, anxiety, insomnia, and substance abuse issues, as
well as improvements in their career and family functioning.17

 These factors were thought to be connected to psychopatho-
logical processes that contribute to PTSD19 and their miti-
gation may be involved in the mechanism for reduction in
PTSD symptoms.15 An uncontrolled pilot trial examined the
effects of TM practice in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Opera-
tion Enduring Freedom veterans with PTSD.18 Five veterans
with PTSD trained in the TM technique and followed for
12 weeks improved on self-report measures of PTSD symp-
tom severity. These findings were supported by a clinical case
series conducted with active duty military personnel.15
Although existing research presents a case for TM as an
adjunctive treatment option for PTSD, this study was the
first to examine associations of TM with the use of psycho-
tropic medications for PTSD and ADNOS. Prior research
was conducted on limited sample sizes, whereas the current
study focuses on a larger sample and employs a control
group, increasing generalizability. The purpose of this study
was to determine whether the regular practice of TM was
associated with decreases in PTSD and ADNOS symptom
severity and the need for psychotropic medications required for
PTSD and ADNOS symptom management. The researchers
hypothesized that military Service Members with PTSD and
ADNOS who practiced TM regularly would require fewer
psychotropic medications to alleviate PTSD symptoms and
exhibit decreased severity in psychological symptoms associ-
ated with PTSD and ADNOS as compared with Service
Members who did not practice TM.
METHODS
A retrospective chart review was conducted at the Dwight D.
Eisenhower Army Medical Center (DDEAMC) Traumatic
Brain Injury (TBI) Clinic at Fort Gordon, Georgia. Medica-
tion prescription and usage data as well as psychological mea-
sures were collected and analyzed for a period of 6 months.
Data collected at the start of TM practice were compared to
results after 1, 2, 3, and 6 months. The Institutional Review
Board at the DDEAMC approved the study.
Sample
The sample included 74 military Service Members with doc-
umented PTSD or ADNOS diagnoses, 37 who practiced TM
and 37 who did not. To be considered for TM training, par-
ticipants were required to be military Service Members with
PTSD or ADNOS diagnoses who were stationed at Fort
Gordon, GA at the time of the training. Of the 50 individ-
uals who participated in TM training between March 2012
and January 2014, 37 qualified for participation in the cur-
rent study because of completion of the TM training and
self-report of regular TM practice (once per day, 5 days per
week) for at least 3 months following the start of training.
Study participants were also required to be enrolled in or to
have completed PE or CPT with a licensed behavior health
provider and to have been prescribed psychotropic medica-
tions by a DDEAMC psychiatrist (n = 37). Individuals who
had either begun but failed to complete the training or those
that did not practice TM regularly following the training
were excluded (n = 13).
Referrals for the TM program were made from clinic pro-
viders, clinical social workers in the Warrior in Transition
Battalion, psychology residents, and word of mouth from
military Service Member participants. All Service Members
with a diagnosis of TBI in the TM group were enrolled in
the TBI Clinic for at least 3 months with the exception of
2 Service Members who did not have a TBI diagnosis. These
2 were in behavior health treatment for at least 3 months
before enrollment.
A control group of 37 participants, selected from the TBI
Clinic files in the Armed Forces Health Longitudinal Technol-
ogy Application (AHLTA) database, included military Service
Members with either PTSD or ADNOS who had been
patients at DDEAMC within the last 5 years. To allow for a
comparable sample population, the control group was matched
to the experimental group with respect to age, sex, and PTSD/
ADNOS diagnoses, and was selected chronologically begin-
ning in 2009. As the TM program at DDEAMC was intro-
duced in March 2012, chart records for the TM group did not
extend before that date, whereas the control group included
patients in the TBI Clinic between 2009 and 2014. As the TBI
Clinic at DDEAMC has a limited capacity to provide behavior
health treatment for patients at any given time, it was neces-
sary to extend control group selection back 3 years before the
start of TM to obtain a comparable control group. During this
3-year period, the TBI and behavioral health staffing, treatment
algorithms, and practice demonstrated no significant changes.
The participants consisted primarily of men because of
the higher proportion of men within the military and in
direct combat positions. All patients were active duty mili-
tary Service Members, reservists, or National Guard mem-
bers between the ages of 24 and 61 years who had PTSD
and/or ADNOS diagnoses obtained through formal testing
by a DDEAMC behavior health or other military licensed
behavior health provider.
Description of the TM Technique
The TM technique is taught in the United States by the
Maharishi Foundation (a 501(c)(3) nonprofit educational orga-
nization) by certified teachers.7 The TM practice is a cyclical
process characterized by movement of attention from the active
level of thinking to more silent and abstract levels to reach a
level of fully awake self-awareness, followed by movement of
attention back to the active thinking level.20 A state of deep
rest for the body and increased alertness for the mind facilitates
release of mental and physical stress.20
Standard teaching materials and format were used as
previously described.7 TM training involved a seven-step
course of instruction comprising six 1.5- to 2-hour individ-
ual and group meetings conducted over 5 days. Follow-up
and maintenance sessions were provided weekly for the first

 month and twice monthly for the next month at the
DDEAMC.15 Participation was voluntary, and military Ser-
vice Members were given the opportunity to discontinue
participation at any time for any reason.
Measures
Psychotropic medications were defined as any medication
intended for emotional and behavior modification. Review
of treatment records included psychotropic medications such
as, antidepressants, anxiolytics, including benzodiazepines,
antipsychotics, and antiepileptics used for psychiatric indi-
cations. Dosages were measured by milligram amount. Psy-
chotropic medication administration, determined per military
Service Member self-report and frequency of medication
refills, was defined as the total dosage of psychotropic medi-
cations taken per week by the participant at baseline, and 1-,
2-, 3-, and 6-month time intervals. Prescription refill infor-
mation from the primary psychiatrist/physician assistant and
behavior health provider was retrieved from the electronic
medical records systems used by the Department of Defense,
AHLTA encounter notes, and the Composite Health Care
System (CHCS). This information was reviewed at baseline
and 1, 2, 3, and 6 months from the start of TM training, or,
for the control group, from the start of TBI care as measured
by the first appointment with a TBI behavior health special-
ist. Because appointments did not always occur precisely at
those time intervals, the closest appointment to each marker
(±1 week maximum) was used for data collection. For the
control group, initial dosage determinations were made on
the date of the first appointment with a TBI Clinic psychia-
trist or physician assistant. For the TM group, initial deter-
minations were made on the date of the first day of TM
training. Information on psychotropic medication prescrip-
tion and self-administration was collected to address the
question of whether TM practice decreases the need for
medication to alleviate psychological symptoms. Medication
administration was measured by the regularity of refills, as
the prescription dosage in itself does not display the regularity
of participant medication usage.
Psychological symptom severity was determined from self-
report surveys in common use at the DDEAMC: (1) The
BASIS-24, (Basis and Symptom Identification Scale) is a
24-item standardized scale intended to identify a wide range
of symptoms and problems that occur across the diagnostic
spectrum, including depression and functioning, relation-
ships, self-harm, emotional lability, psychosis, and substance
abuse.21 Internal consistency reliability (Cronbach α) coeffi-
cients ranged from 0.75 to 0.89 and test–retest reliability
coefficients (intraclass correlation coefficients) ranged from 0.81
to 0.96 for inpatients.22 (2) The OQ-45, (Outcome Question-
naire) is a 45-question self-report outcome tracking instrument,
which assesses symptom distress, interpersonal functioning,
and social role.23 The OQ-45 has a good internal consistency
(α = 0.93) and test–retest reliability (r = 0.79).24 (3) The PCL-S
is a 17-item self-report measure of the 17 DSM-IV symptoms
of PTSD with high internal consistency (α = 0.97) and test–
retest reliability (r = 0.96).25 The OQ-45 was selected for usage
by the DDEAMC Behavior Health Care Line staff and was the
primary outcome measure used from 2008–2013. In 2013, the
Army Medical Command mandated a change to the BASIS-24
and PCL-S. These outcome measures were chosen for their
high validity and reliability as well as their applicability across
populations. Although the OQ-45 and BASIS-24 were not
designed specifically as measures of PTSD or ADNOS symp-
tom severity, they measure the core aspects of these disorders,
cut across diagnoses to assess improvement over time, and pro-
vide cut-scores for reliable change and recovery,26,27 aims
that are consistent with the research questions identified in the
present study. The researchers chose to include all three of the
aforementioned psychological measures in collection and anal-
ysis to gain the most thorough understanding of changes across
time intervals. Although the OQ-45 was in regular use from
2009 to 2012, the BASIS-24 was most commonly used from
2013 to 2014, whereas the PCL-S was utilized intermittently
across all time intervals. To include only one of these measures
in analysis would have provided an incomplete picture of psy-
chological changes in the sample population. The researchers
chose to measure percent change in psychological testing
scores and increases versus decreases in overall medication
prescription usage as these measures were the clearest indicators
of changes in symptomatology given the availability of data.
Statistical Analysis
All data and statistical analyses were performed using SPSS
Version 20.28 Comparative analyses evaluated differences
between the experimental (TM) and control groups after
each time interval to determine whether TM, in conjunction
with PE or CPT, served as a more effective method of reduc-
ing the severity of PTSD and ADNOS symptomatology
and medication reliance for symptom management than PE
or CPT alone. For the 74 participants included in analysis,
27 medications were prescribed as part of 8 different medica-
tion categories. Each participant was prescribed between 1 and
12 medications during the 6-month study period. As such,
the most accurate, reliable method of quantifying medication
prescription usage across multiple medications and time inter-
vals was selected. Psychotropic medication information was
recorded in terms of increases, decreases, or stabilization of
prescription amounts, as well as when new additional medica-
tions were introduced at each time interval. Changes in medi-
cation dosage were determined as being greater, equal to, or
less than previous prescription amounts as modified from
the initial measurement. For all mean calculations, pair-wise
exclusions of missing data were performed. All cases with
available data at each specified time interval were included in
analyses for that time point. This method of analysis directly
addressed the question of a correlation between decreases in
reliance on psychotropic medications and TM participation, as

 it allowed for a quantified comparison of overall medication
usage between study groups.
Changes in psychological symptom severity (where a
decrease in symptom severity represents an increase in
wellbeing) were measured from the baseline at 1, 2, 3, and
6 months from the start of treatment for both groups. A
2-period forecast trend line was created to display the pre-
dicted trend in psychological symptoms following treatment.
To determine wellbeing, simple unweighted frequencies eval-
uated increases, stabilizations, and decreases in symptom
severity between groups. For all participants, mean change
scores were formulated based on the psychological test
(BASIS-24, OQ-45, PCL-S) taken most frequently across
time intervals. Because participants typically completed only
one of the three tests across time intervals, percent change
scores of the representative test were utilized to compare
results by group as a method of generalizing across tests. The
χ2 tests evaluated the significance of the between-groups rela-
tionship for medication dosage changes at each time interval.
The dependent variables were psychotropic medication dosage
changes and a composite of changes in psychological symp-
tom severity based on BASIS-24, OQ-45, and PCL-S scores.
A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test
for differences in psychological wellbeing between the two
groups. Data (i.e., psychological test scores) were analyzed as
dependent variables using: 2 (Intervention: TM vs. Control) by
2 (Time: baseline vs. 1, 2, 3, and 6 months postintervention)
repeated measures analyses of variance with time as the
repeated measure. Percent changes in psychological symptom
severity were measured from the start of the study period as
well as between intervals to determine whether TM had a
long-lasting or temporary effect on psychological wellbeing.
RESULTS
Table I displays participant demographics as reported in
AHLTA. There were no statistically significant differences
between the groups on age, gender, or PTSD/ADNOS diag-
nosis ( ps > 0.36). Of the 74 participants included in the
study, 73.0% (n = 27) of the TM group and 70.3% (n = 26)
of the control group were already taking psychotropic medi-
cations at the start of treatment.
Table II compares changes in the dosage of existing med-
ications and addition of new medications prescribed to the
TM and control groups at 1, 2, 3, and 6 months from the start
of treatment. The TM group was less likely to increase medi-
cation dosages and more likely to show medication stabiliza-
tion, decreases, or cessations. At 1 month, 83.7% (n = 31) of
the TM group stabilized, decreased, or ceased medications
and 10.8% (n = 4) increased medication dosage. In the con-
trol group, 59.4% (n = 22) showed stabilizations, decreases,
or cessations and 40.5% (n = 15) increased medications
(χ2 [3] = 9.243; p = 0.026). A similar pattern was observed
after 3 months, when 75.6% (n = 28) of the TM group
showed decreases or stabilization as compared to 59.4%
(n = 22) of the control group (χ2 [3] = 16.899; p = 0.001). At
1 month, 5.4% (n = 2) of the TM group and 32.4% (n = 12)
of the control group added additional medications (χ2 [1] =
8.197; p = 0.004), and at 3 months, only 2.7% (n = 1) of
the TM group added an additional medication as compared to
27.0% (n = 10) of the control group (χ2 [1] = 8.118; p = 0.004).
Figure 1 displays the changes in prescription medication
by
treatment
group,
including
increases
in
medication
dosages and the introduction of additional medications over a
6-month period. The control group increased medication dos-
ages significantly more often than the TM group after 1 month
(p = 0.026) and 3 months (p = 0.001) but the changes were
not statistically significant at 2 and 6 months (ps = ns). There
was also a greater introduction of additional medications
among the control group as compared to the TM group after
1 month (p = 0.004) and 3 months (p = 0.004) that were not
statistically significant at 2 and 6 months (ps = ns).
Figure 2 displays mean changes in psychological symp-
tom severity. The TM group was associated with a decrease
in symptom severity from baseline after 6 months (M =
0.898, SD = 0.212), with a two-period forecast trend line
predicting a continued decrease in symptom severity after
6 months. The control group was associated with an increase
in symptom severity from baseline after 6 months (M =
1.103, SD = 0.552), with a 2-period forecast trend line

Although not statistically significant at 2 and 6 months,
changes in the psychological symptom severity scores dif-
fered between the two groups with a decrease for the TM

DISCUSSION
Overall, the results suggested that active duty military Ser-
vice Members with PTSD or ADNOS who regularly practice
TM, in addition to receiving traditional therapies, may expe-
rience decreases in medication reliance and psychological
symptom severity compared with those who received the

 same therapies without TM. The practice of TM was (1)
more likely to be associated with decreasing, ceasing, or sta-
bilizing psychotropic prescription dosages; (2) less likely to
be associated with additional medications; and (3) more
likely to be associated with decreases or stabilizations on
self-report measures of psychological symptom severity
compared with controls. The association of medication
decreases for the TM group was statistically significant after
1 and 3 months. These findings were in accord with previ-
ous results of a 12-month study of patients with hyper-
tension, which found that the practice of TM significantly
decreased the use of antihypertensive medications compared
to controls.13
Although the relationship between the TM and control
groups with respect to decreases or stabilizations in medica-
tion prescription after 2 and 6 months was not statistically
significant, the introduction of new medications for the con-
trol group was observed at almost twice the frequency of the
TM group with more TM subjects showing a decrease or
stabilization in medication usage. Although not statistically
significant, psychological wellbeing improved among the
TM group after 6 months, whereas the control group showed
a slight decrease in wellbeing. It is important to note that
although both groups displayed relatively stable psychologi-
cal scores, the TM group was able to stabilize scores without
increasing medication dosages, whereas the control group
required increases in medication dosages for similarly stable
or worsened results. Studies indicate that medication and
therapy in combination serves as a more effective treatment
for behavior health conditions than either treatment strategy
alone.29 In the Department of Defense and the Veterans
Administration, medication treatment of PTSD is not consid-
ered a class “A” recommendation. The TM program may
serve to address the stigma of being seen by a military
behavior health provider, making it a potentially attractive
treatment option for Service Members.6
If TM is to be considered as an effective adjunct therapy
for relief of PTSD and ADNOS symptoms, the findings sug-
gest that a reduction in the use of psychotropic medication
use may be expected. An important consideration is the hesi-
tancy that behavior health providers may have discontinuing
a medication that seems to be working. Consider the scenario
of a patient who is on psychotropic medication(s) and practic-
ing TM who reports his symptoms as stable or perhaps even
improving. In such a situation where both therapies have been
initiated, the provider faces a difficult decision in his evalua-
tion of the patient’s progress, as there is no definitive way to
know whether the stabilization or improvement in symptoms
is due to the medications or TM.
Study Limitations
Internal Validity
The findings may be viewed with caution because of the small
convenience sample size. The confounding variable of matu-
ration was controlled for by the use of a matching control
group, such that “time” was not observed to have an effect on
recovery independent of TM practice. All individuals who
fit the subject study criteria were included in the analyses to
increase the possibility of equitable selection.
The instrumentation for the quantification of medication
changes was a potential limitation to the study design.
Because this study was completed through retrospective chart
review, the authors could not control for medication prescrip-
tion changes or limit the total number of medications pre-
scribed. There was also the difficulty of quantifying multiple
medications. Among participants in both groups, prescription
of 27 different medications over 8 different medication cate-
gories resulted in limitations to generalizability of dosage
changes. It was necessary to extend control group selection
back 3 years before the start of TM to obtain a group of com-
parable size. During this period, the TBI and behavior health
staffing, treatment algorithms, and practice demonstrated no
significant changes.
Misuse of medication among patients who may have been
medication noncompliant may have adversely impacted data
collection on prescribed medication dosages and regularity of
filled prescriptions but this effect applied to both groups. With
regard to the statistical analysis, our methodology directly
addressed the question of a correlation between decreases in
reliance on psychotropic medications and TM participation,
as it allowed for a quantified comparison of overall medica-
tion usage between study groups.
Although both the control and the TM group were sub-
ject to the same therapeutic interventions, CPT and PE
therapy were not administered in an identical time frame
to both groups. The control group participated in psycho-
therapy during an earlier time frame than the TM group and
external factors affecting the controls may have changed,
including mental health providers’ treatment styles, organi-
zational policies, military culture, and war-related events and
media coverage.
Data missing because of lack of availability of documenta-
tion and the lack of a consistent severity tool limited the psy-
chological symptom findings. In addition, patients did not
always complete psychological testing measures within the
specified time intervals. A further limitation listed was the
lack of participant information following discharge from
the military. Many members receiving treatment for behavior
health conditions were also undergoing medical disability
reviews and were not always available 6 months after the start
of treatment, as they may have been discharged from active
duty military service. Consequently, participants may have
filled prescriptions through civilian pharmacies, at which
point the AHLTA or CHCS databases may have falsely read
as “no active medications.” To address these issues we rea-
soned that because the TM and control groups were matched,
it was likely that this effect was similarly prevalent in both
groups and consequently less likely to pose a risk to the
validity of the results.

Impact of Transcendental Meditation on Psychotropic Medication Use

 External Validity
A larger sample size would have allowed for better generali-
zation of study results, however, we were limited to 37 indi-
viduals who fit the criteria for the intervention group.
Further research will need to be conducted to determine
whether the findings can be repeated in other Army hospitals
with active duty Service Members, Veterans, and civilians
who have never served in the military. It is unknown
whether these findings are generalizable to other meditation
and mindfulness practices as alternative therapies.
Military Relevance and Conclusion
The most effective course of treatment for PTSD has been
highly debated and is currently a central focus in the mili-
tary community because of the large number of Service
Members returning from recent deployment with PTSD.30
The most pressing concern among military behavior and
physical health providers is how best to provide effective,
quality care to Service Members. Overall, the findings sug-
gest that TM practice decreases psychotropic medication
dosages and improves psychological testing scores com-
pared with matched controls. It is anticipated that this chart
review will provide valuable insight into the benefits of TM
as a viable treatment modality in military treatment facilities.
The retrospective chart review provided a valuable tool for
quickly and inexpensively gathering pilot data and aids in
guiding the development of future prospective studies. Based
on our findings, a prospective randomized clinical trial of
TM and its effects on behavioral wellness and psychotropic
usage is warranted to determine if TM may serve as a viable
supplement to therapy or as an alternative to psychotropic
medication therapy.
