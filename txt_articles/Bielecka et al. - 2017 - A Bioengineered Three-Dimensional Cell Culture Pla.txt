ABSTRACT Antimicrobial resistance presents one of the most significant threats to
human health, with the emergence of totally drug-resistant organisms. We have
combined bioengineering, genetically modified bacteria, longitudinal readouts, and
fluidics to develop a transformative platform to address the drug development bot-
tleneck, utilizing Mycobacterium tuberculosis as the model organism. We generated
microspheres incorporating virulent reporter bacilli, primary human cells, and an extra-
cellular matrix by using bioelectrospray methodology. Granulomas form within the
three-dimensional matrix, and mycobacterial stress genes are upregulated. Pyrazinamide,
a vital first-line antibiotic for treating human tuberculosis, kills M. tuberculosis in a three-
dimensional culture but not in a standard two-dimensional culture or Middle-
brook 7H9 broth, demonstrating that antibiotic sensitivity within microspheres
reflects conditions in patients. We then performed pharmacokinetic modeling by
combining the microsphere system with a microfluidic plate and demonstrated
that we can model the effect of dynamic antibiotic concentrations on mycobac-
terial killing. The microsphere system is highly tractable, permitting variation of
cell content, the extracellular matrix, sphere size, the infectious dose, and the
surrounding medium with the potential to address a wide array of human infec-
tions and the threat of antimicrobial resistance.
IMPORTANCE Antimicrobial resistance is a major global threat, and an emerging
concept is that infection should be studied in the context of host immune cells. Tu-
berculosis is a chronic infection that kills over a million people every year and is be-
coming progressively more resistant to antibiotics. Recent major studies of shorter
treatment or new vaccination approaches have not been successful, demonstrating
that transformative technologies are required to control tuberculosis. We have devel-
oped an entirely new system to study the infection of host cells in a three-dimensional
matrix by using bioengineering. We showed that antibiotics that work in patients are
effective in this microsphere system but not in standard infection systems. We then
combined microspheres with microfluidics to model drug concentration changes in
patients and demonstrate the effect of increasing antibiotic concentrations on bacte-
rial survival. This system can be widely applied to address the threat of antimicrobial
resistance and develop new treatments.

 T
he progressive emergence of drug-resistant bacteria poses one of the most press-
ing threats to human health, with the development of totally resistant bacteria
potentially leading to a return to the preantibiotic era (1–3). The pipeline of new
antibiotics in development is inadequate to combat the rate of evolution of microbial
resistance (4, 5). To develop antibiotics, bacteria have traditionally been studied in
broth culture, where bacilli are rapidly dividing under optimal growth conditions.
However, an emerging concept is that studying pathogens in the context of the host
is vital to fully understanding pathogenesis (6, 7). Interaction with host cells modulates
multiple facets of bacterial physiology and causes stress-induced changes in bacterial
gene expression (8). In parallel, evidence is accumulating that host cell biology is
modulated by three-dimensional (3D) extracellular matrix interactions, regulating key
processes in the host-pathogen interaction such as cell survival, phagolysosomal fusion,
autophagy, and cytokine secretion (9, 10). In patients being treated for infection, the
host-pathogen interaction occurs in three dimensions and antibiotic concentrations
vary over time according to drug pharmacokinetics (11). Conversely, the vast majority
of in vitro studies are done in the absence of human cells, without an extracellular
matrix, and at static antibiotic concentrations.
Considering these concepts together, we concluded that a transformative system to
address the threat of antimicrobial resistance requires the following elements: primary
host cells infected with fully virulent bacteria, culturing within a 3D structure that
incorporates a physiological extracellular matrix, and pharmacokinetic modeling of
drug concentrations. These criteria represent a significant challenge in the context of
virulent organisms because of the high biosafety containment level required and the
complexity of bacteria being eluted under flow conditions. We utilized Mycobacterium
tuberculosis, a pathogen that is inherently resistant to antibiotics and causes tubercu-
losis (TB) (12), to develop a system that addresses these technical obstacles and have
recently reported on an investigation of the host immune response in this system (13).
TB is the leading cause of death from an infectious disease worldwide (14), and over
the last 2 decades, multidrug-resistant, extensively drug-resistant, and totally drug-
resistant strains have sequentially emerged, posing the specter of a completely un-
treatable disease (15). Unfortunately, major recent trials of novel treatment-shortening
regimens have not been successful (16), indicating that the model systems that were
used to inform these approaches do not sufficiently reflect the disease in humans.
Furthermore, pyrazinamide (PZA), one of the most critical antibiotics in human TB
treatment, would not have been discovered by current screening approaches. Current
models are principally reliant on microbiological broth or solid medium culture, 2D
culture, zebrafish, and mice (17). Novel PZA-based regimens show promise (18), and so
reliably understanding the action of PZA has become critical, principally focused on
mutational analysis of PZA resistance (19). These approaches have limitations, espe-
cially in the context of PZA’
s complex activation, intracellular activity, and uncertain
mode of action. For some other drugs, such as cycloserine, nearly all drug susceptibility
systems are unreliable. M. tuberculosis is an obligate pathogen of humans and has a
prolonged interaction with host cells, centered on adaption to survival within an
intracellular niche (20). In addition, the host-pathogen interaction is spatially organized
(21) and the extracellular matrix influences host cell survival (22), suggesting that a fully
humanized system structured in three dimensions with an extracellular matrix is
needed to identify novel treatments for TB.
Therefore, we developed a platform utilizing M. tuberculosis as the prototype
organism. Our system integrated genetically modified virulent reporter bacilli, primary
human cells, and a human extracellular matrix by using a bioengineering approach and
combined this with a multiparameter longitudinal readout. Within this microsphere
system, we demonstrate cellular aggregation and upregulation of mycobacterial stress
genes. Critically, PZA is efficacious in the 3D microsphere system but not in standard
broth or 2D culture. We then combined microspheres with a microfluidic system to
permit pharmacokinetic modeling. We observed more rapid M. tuberculosis killing with
higher peak antibiotic concentrations, similar to outcomes in patients with TB (23).

resistance.
RESULTS
Granulomas develop within microspheres, and M. tuberculosis stress genes are
upregulated. We incorporated primary human cells, virulent M. tuberculosis, and type
I collagen into 3D microspheres by bioelectrospray methodology (see Movie S1 in the
supplemental material). Fluorescent staining of monocytes and T cells, followed by
infection with mCherry-expressing M. tuberculosis, showed the distribution of cells and
bacteria through the microspheres and early granuloma formation from day 4 (Fig. 1A).
After 14 days of infection, large cellular aggregates resembling human granulomas

 developed, while no aggregates formed in uninfected microspheres (Fig. 1B). Granu-
loma formation was associated with evidence of mycobacterial stress. Multiple stress-
related genes were upregulated at day 14 in comparison with M. tuberculosis in 7H9
broth culture analyzed by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) (Fig. 1C),
including lipF, the acid stress real-time response gene; recA encoding recombinase A,
the key mediator of the SOS response to DNA damage; relA, the nutrient stress-related
gene; and sodA, the oxidative-stress response gene. By infecting cells with genetically
modified luminescent M. tuberculosis expressing the Lux operon (24), bacterial growth
could be monitored longitudinally over time within microspheres in a nondestructive
manner (Fig. 1D).
To determine the localization of mycobacteria, we studied microspheres longi-
tudinally. We compared extracellular with cell-associated bacteria by decapsulating
microspheres and performing differential centrifugation to separate extracellular
mycobacteria from intracellular and cell-adherent mycobacteria. The proportion of
cell-associated mycobacteria analyzed by luminescence or CFU counting progressively
increased over time (Fig. 2A and B), leading to a 20.7-fold increase in luminescence of
cell-associated M. tuberculosis relative to extracellular M. tuberculosis within micro-
spheres at day 15. Gentamicin treatment in a single experiment demonstrated that
cell-associated mycobacteria were almost all intracellular, with no significant reduction
in CFU counts after the killing of extracellular bacteria. Similarly, the fluorescence of
cells infected with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing M. tuberculosis progres-
sively increased over time (Fig. 2C; Fig. S1), demonstrating intracellular proliferation. M.
tuberculosis infection did not increase cellular toxicity when measured by the CytoTox
Glo 3D assay, with no significant difference in viability between the two conditions
(Fig. 2D).
Standard antibiotics kill M. tuberculosis under all conditions. Having demon-
strated granuloma formation and the M. tuberculosis stress response within micro-
spheres, we first studied standard first-line antibiotics in 2D cell culture and the 3D
model to determine the tractability of the model and whether killing efficacy is the
same under both conditions. Rifampin, isoniazid (INH), and ethambutol were added to
cell culture medium around spheres at physiological concentrations (1, 0.25, and
4 �g/ml, respectively). All three antibiotics inhibited M. tuberculosis growth in both 2D
and 3D cell culture systems (Fig. 3A and B, antibiotics added at day 6; Fig. S2, antibiotics
added at day 1). Rifampin was the most efficacious at killing M. tuberculosis, and INH
was consistently more efficient at controlling M. tuberculosis in the 3D microsphere
system than in 2D cell cultures. M. tuberculosis growth analyzed by luminescence
correlated closely with CFU counts on Middlebrook 7H11 agar (Fig. 3C).
PZA is only efficacious in microspheres and not in broth or 2D cell cultures.
Next, we investigated PZA, which is a key antibiotic in treating human disease but has
a poorly defined mechanism of action at the concentration described in epithelial cell
lining fluid (25). PZA had no effect on M. tuberculosis growth in 7H9 broth without cells
at neutral pH (Fig. 4A). In 2D primary cell cultures, PZA had a temporary effect but M.
tuberculosis growth rapidly recovered (Fig. 4B). Critically, PZA killed M. tuberculosis in
the 3D microsphere system, with luminescence falling to background levels by day 30
when we used the same antibiotic preparation that had no effect in broth and a
transient effect in 2D cultures (Fig. 4C). A similar pattern of efficacy was observed when
PZA was added to cultures on day 1, with PZA having no effect in 7H9 broth and a
temporary effect in 2D cultures but complete control of M. tuberculosis growth in
microspheres (Fig. S3). Colony counting on 7H11 agar confirmed that the efficacy of M.
tuberculosis killing by PZA was equivalent to that of INH and moxifloxacin (Fig. 4D;
Fig. S2D).
Second-line antibiotics are most efficacious in 3D microspheres. We then ex-
amined the effect of the second-line antibiotics D-cycloserine, moxifloxacin, and lin-
ezolid, which are of increasing importance with the emergence of drug-resistant TB. In
7H9 broth, D-cycloserine at a low concentration had a minor inhibitory effect but at a

 high concentration it was as effective as moxifloxacin (Fig. 5A). In the 2D and 3D
systems, D-cycloserine effectively killed M. tuberculosis at low and high concentrations
(Fig. 5B and C). Linezolid and moxifloxacin effectively suppressed M. tuberculosis growth
under all three conditions. INH, which was included as a control first-line antibiotic,
consistently killed M. tuberculosis in 3D microspheres, but bacterial growth resumed in
7H9 broth and the 2D system. A similar pattern was observed when antibiotics were
added at day 1, although the inhibition of M. tuberculosis growth by D-cycloserine was
more rapid in microspheres than in 2D cultures (Fig. S4). To ensure that the antibiotics
were not having a cytotoxic effect on host cells, we analyzed their viability and found
no evidence of cytotoxicity after 21 days of culture compared to medium and dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) controls (Fig. S5).

 rifampin, as its concentrations in plasma correlate with treatment outcomes (23). We
manufactured a microfluidic plate from milled poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA),
providing each well with two inlets and one outlet, permitting a smooth flow of
medium through the wells containing microspheres (Fig. 6B). Initially, bacterial lumi-
nescence from the 24-well plate was undetectable on a GloMax DISCover plate reader.
To overcome this, we used phenol red-free medium, optimized the microsphere density
within wells, and placed a custom-made mirror under the plate. These modifications
greatly improved the luminescence readout (Fig. 6C and D), and we were able to
monitor bacterial growth from experimental time zero.

 To model pharmacokinetics in patients, rifampin at a range of concentrations (0.25,
1, and 4 �g/ml) was used to irrigated wells from day 5, incubated for 6 h, and then
washed out to leave a minimal antibiotic concentration overnight. A stepwise increase
in the rifampin concentration in individual wells produced dose-dependent killing of M.
tuberculosis (Fig. 6E). The highest 6-h peak rifampin concentration caused M. tubercu-
losis killing equal to that of a constant 1 �g/ml antibiotic concentration or that of
irrigation with medium with rifampin at 1 �g/ml (Fig. S6A). Luminescence increased
overnight in the absence of antibiotics, resulting in a sawtooth pattern of killing that
did not occur at a fixed antibiotic concentration and demonstrated rapid recovery of
mycobacterial growth once antibiotic pressure was removed. Colony counts on 7H11
agar confirmed that the luminescence data reflected the total bacterial load (Fig. S6B).

 DISCUSSION
Antimicrobial resistance is rapidly emerging as one of the most pressing challenges
to global society (2, 3). Innovative approaches to studying the host-pathogen interac-
tion are urgently needed to identify novel treatment approaches that counter the
evolution of drug-resistant bacteria. To achieve this, an emerging paradigm is that
bacteria should be studied in the context of the host (6). We hypothesized that a
transformative platform will require multiple elements that are not currently available
in a single system: virulent reporter bacteria, primary human cells, an extracellular
matrix, 3D organization of the host-pathogen interaction, and pharmacokinetic mod-
eling. We combined diverse methodologies, including genetically modified bacteria,
primary human cell culture, electrostatic microsphere generation, multiparameter read-
outs, and microfluidics, to develop a platform with all of the requisite elements that
could be used in a biosafety level 3 containment environment. In our investigation of
the host immune response, we showed that host cell survival is improved in the 3D
microsphere model, cellular aggregates form, and host-directed therapies can be
studied (13). Here, we investigated the system from the pathogen’
s perspective and
demonstrated that mycobacterial stress genes are upregulated and key antibiotics used
to treat human disease are more efficacious in the microsphere system than in standard
culture. The nondestructive readouts permit longitudinal analysis over prolonged
periods and real-time pharmacokinetic modeling. This platform has the potential to
revolutionize antibiotic discovery and to replace suboptimal animal model systems
based on inappropriate host-pathogen combinations.

 Miniaturized organoid systems and lab-on-a-chip technologies are rapidly evolving
fields for drug discovery, resulting from the widespread belief that studying individual
cells or infectious organisms in isolation does not sufficiently reflect conditions in vivo
(26, 27). The bioelectrosprayer can produce large numbers of identical microspheres
rapidly in a patient-relevant model, fulfilling a principal requirement of such a system
(28). 2D systems with flow have been developed to study respiratory epithelial cell
infection (29), and while several TB cellular systems have been reported (30–34), none
combine 3D culture, collagen, and the potential for high-throughput or longitudinal
analysis. The microsphere system is highly tractable, with the ability to modulate
infectious organism and doses, host cellular content, the extracellular matrix, micro-
sphere size, and the surrounding medium dynamically.
The need for new antibiotics for TB is particularly acute, given the progressive
emergence of drug resistance, recent disappointments in treatment-shortening regi-
mens, and the ongoing global toll of infection (14). PZA is one of the most important
antibiotics used to treat human disease, but it was discovered serendipitously in the
1950s and indeed would have not been found by current screening approaches based
on the sequential study of MICs in broth culture, murine infections, and human disease
(17). PZA has a complex mechanism of action, requiring intracellular acidification. We
demonstrated that M. tuberculosis stress genes were upregulated in microspheres and
that PZA killed M. tuberculosis in microspheres at neutral pH but not in standard 2D
culture systems at a concentration found in epithelial lining fluid (25). This confirms
that, within microspheres, bacilli are in a PZA-sensitive compartment and demonstrates
the potential to identify other compounds only active against stressed mycobacteria in
the correct microenvironment. Similarly, we found that INH was consistently more
effective in the 3D system that in the 2D system, with a more rapid fall in luminescence
and no failed treatments, supporting the relevance of the model to human TB.
Therefore, the system can identify drug resistance in a more clinically relevant fashion
and can be used to study novel regimens with variable concentrations in combination
rather than single new agents at static concentrations.
The microsphere system has potential for high-throughput use, as �5,000 micro-
spheres can be generated from a single blood donor within an hour and the diameter
is compatible with a 384-well format. Mycobacterial killing curves during antibiotic
treatment of patients suggest that there are diverse populations within patients’lungs
(35), and therefore, the system can be used to study the separate physiological
conditions that drive these within the same experiment, such as hypoxia and nutritional
stress. Encapsulation within microspheres permits integration with a microfluidic sys-
tem without cells and bacteria being lost during irrigation, resolving a significant
technical hurdle for pharmacokinetic studies. We were able to show more rapid killing
with increased rifampin concentrations, consistent with findings in patients (23, 36).
Microfluidics have been used to develop an array of organ-on-a-chip models (37), but
we are not aware of development to study virulent containment level 3 pathogens such
as M. tuberculosis, which represents additional challenges because of the infection risk.
The hollow-fiber model has been used to perform advanced pharmacokinetic model-
ing, but PZA is only efficacious in this system after acidification to pH 5.8 (38) and so
cannot be studied in combination with other agents. Future potential developments for
the bioelectrospray platform include dual encapsulation to permit a central lipid-rich
caseous core, generating an additional layer of flexibility and modeling drug penetra-
tion into necrotic foci (39). Development of the microfluidic plate will permit optimi-
zation of combinations of multiple antibiotics in a fully humanized system, with
pharmacokinetic modeling of each antibiotic within wells, to identify the best combi-
nations with which to go forward to clinical trials (34).
We developed a bioengineered cell culture platform that replicates key features of
human disease and incorporates primary human cells, an extracellular matrix, a 3D
structure, virulent bacteria, and pharmacokinetic modeling. The microsphere system is
highly tractable, permitting variation of cell content, the extracellular matrix, sphere
size, the infectious dose, and the surrounding medium with the potential to address a

 wide array of human infections. The system can equally be applied to diverse inflam-
matory and malignant human diseases. Integration with molecular microbiology tech-
niques and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat gene editing will
provide genetically tractable host-pathogen pairings. Therefore, this platform has
global applicability to address the threat of antimicrobial resistance and deliver new
treatments.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bacterial strains, culture conditions, and chemicals. Bioluminescent M. tuberculosis H37Rv (M.
tuberculosis Lux) (24) and mCherry-expressing M. tuberculosis H37Rv (40) were cultured in Middlebrook
7H9 medium (BD Biosciences UK, Oxford, United Kingdom) supplemented with 10% ADC Enrichment
(Scientific Laboratory Supplies, Nottingham, UK), 0.2% glycerol, 0.02% Tween 80, and kanamycin (25 �g/
ml) or hygromycin (50 �g/ml), respectively. For all experiments, cultures were grown to an optical density
at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.6 (approximately 1 � 108 CFU/ml). Bacterial growth in 7H9 broth was monitored
by measuring luminescence (GloMax 20/20 Single Tube luminometer; Promega, United Kingdom).
Chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich unless stated otherwise.
Human PBMC isolation and infection. Ethical approval for these studies was provided by the
National Research Ethics Service Committee South Central—Southampton A, ref. 13/SC/0043. Peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from single-donor buffy coats from the National Health
Service Blood and Transplant, Southampton, United Kingdom. Leukocytes were isolated by density
gradient centrifugation over Ficoll-Paque (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, United Kingdom). Isolated PBMCs
were infected with M. tuberculosis Lux at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 and kept overnight at 37°
C
in a 5% CO2 incubator in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10 �g/ml ampicillin, 2 mM glutamine,
25 �g/ml kanamycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum (Labtech International Ltd.). The next day, infected
PBMCs were transferred from vented flasks to 50-ml Falcon tubes after detachment with Versene solution
(Sigma) for 10 min and scraping. After Hanks balanced salt solution (HBSS) without Ca/Mg (Gibco) was
added, cells were centrifuged at 320 � g for 8 min at 4°
C and the supernatant was decanted. The pelleted
cells were resuspended in appropriate volumes of RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10 �g/ml
ampicillin, 2 mM glutamine, 25 �g/ml kanamycin, and 10% human AB serum (Sigma), referred to as
complete RPMI medium.
2D culture. Infected cells were resuspended in 50 ml of complete RPMI medium, and 1 ml was
equally distributed into 2-ml Eppendorf tubes at a final concentration of 3 � 106/ml. Cultures were
incubated at 37°
C in 5% CO2. M. tuberculosis luminescence was monitored with a GloMax 20/20
luminometer. Antibiotics were added at predetermined time points. For colony counts, cultures were
treated with 1% saponin in HBSS and bacteria were plated onto 7H11 agar at serial dilutions. For RT-qPCR
analysis, infected cells were plated into six-well plates at a final concentration of 2.5 � 106/ml.
3D culture. Infected cells were resuspended in complete RPMI medium, mixed with sterile alginate-
collagen at 1 � 106 cells/ml, and injected into an Electrostatic Bead Generator (Nisco, Zurich, Switzerland)
to form microspheres via a Harvard syringe driver as described previously (41). After generation,
microspheres were equally distributed into 2-ml Eppendorf tubes (microsphere volume, 0.4 ml), im-
mersed in 1 ml of complete RPMI medium, and incubated at 37°
C in 5% CO2. M. tuberculosis lumines-
cence was monitored with a GloMax 20/20 luminometer. For CFU counts, microspheres were dissolved
in 55 mM sodium citrate–10 mM EDTA with 1% saponin in HBSS and bacteria were plated onto 7H11
agar. For RT-qPCR analysis, microspheres were cultured in 50-ml Falcon tubes (microsphere volume,
10 ml) in complete RPMI medium.
Immunofluorescence and confocal imaging. PBMCs were separated into monocytes and lympho-
cytes with MACS Cell Separation Columns (Miltenyi Biotec, Inc., Surrey, United Kingdom). Cells were then
labeled with CellTracker Blue or CellTrace CFSE (Thermo, Fisher Scientific, United Kingdom) separately in
accordance with the manufacturer’
s recommendations before infection with mCherry-expressing M. tu-
berculosis H37Rv (40) at an MOI of 0.1. Microspheres were generated and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde
after 4 days. Confocal images were acquired on a Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope and processed with
ImageJ 1.5 0d (NIH, Bethesda, MD).
Transcription analysis by RT-qPCR. For bacteria grown in 7H9 broth (OD600 of 0.25) and 2D
cultures, total RNA was extracted by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min and the addition of 500 �l
of RNAprotect Bacteria Reagent (Qiagen). The resuspended pellet was left for 10 min at room temper-
ature prior to repeat centrifugation and resuspension of the pellet in 1 ml of TRIzol (Life Technologies,
Inc.) and stored at �80°
C. For 3D cultures, RNAlater solution (Ambion) was used to preserve RNA
overnight at 4°
C. Cells were decapsulated with 100 mM sodium citrate and centrifuged at 3,000 � g for
30 min, and the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of TRIzol (Life Technologies, Inc.) and stored at �80°
C
until use. Thawed samples were transferred to Lysis Matrix B tubes containing 0.1-mm silica beads
(Q-Biogene) and homogenized in a MagnaLyser instrument (Roche) at 4,000 rpm for 5 � 45 s with
incubation on ice for 1 min between homogenizations. Samples were centrifuged for 1 min at 16,100 � g
at 4°
C, and the supernatant was transferred to a new Eppendorf tube. After phenol-chloroform extrac-
tion, the nucleic acids were precipitated with isopropanol, washed with 75% ethanol, air dried for 10 to
15 min, and finally resuspended in nuclease-free water (Fisher Scientific). Genomic DNA was removed
with a DNA-free kit (AM1906; Ambion) in accordance with the manufacturer’
s instructions. RNA was
further purified with the Qiagen RNeasy minikit (Qiagen), subjected with on-column DNase digestion
with the RNase-free DNase set (79254; Qiagen), repurified with an RNeasy minikit, and eluted in 50 �l of
RNase- and DNase-free water (Fisher Scientific). The first-strand cDNA was synthesized in 10-�l reaction

 volumes with the High Capacity cDNA RT kit (Applied Biosystems). The cDNA samples were diluted 1:3
in nuclease-free water, and real-time qPCR was performed with 10-�l reaction volumes containing
FastStart Universal Probe Master with Rox (Roche), LNA-based probe (designed with the Universal
ProbeLibrary System Technology [Roche]) (Table 1), oligonucleotides (Sigma) (Table 1), and 1 �l of a
cDNA preparation. Reactions were run on a 7900HT Fast real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) with
the following program: 2 min at 50°
C, 10 min at 95°
C, and 40 cycles of 15 s at 95°
C and 1 min at 60°
C.
All samples were amplified in triplicate, and threshold cycle (CT) values of �40 were considered negative.
Expression data were normalized to the M. tuberculosis housekeeping gene sigA, and relative quantifi-
cations were carried out by the ΔΔCT method.
Eukaryotic cell viability assay. Microspheres containing PBMCs alone or M. tuberculosis-infected
PBMCs were incubated in 96-well plates for 21 days. Cell viability was analyzed at day 21 with the
CellTiter-Glo 3D Cell Viability Assay (Promega) in accordance with the manufacturer’
s instructions.
Luminescence was analyzed by a GloMax Discover 96-well plate reader (Promega, United Kingdom). To
measure cell toxicity, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release was analyzed by a colorimetric activity assay
(Roche, Burgess Hill, United Kingdom).
Analysis of M. tuberculosis location. PBMCs were infected with luminescent M. tuberculosis and
incorporated into microspheres. At predefined time points, microspheres were decapsulated and cell-
associated M. tuberculosis was pelleted by centrifugation at 380 � g for 8 min as previously described
(42–44). At days 7 and 15, additional samples of cell-associated M. tuberculosis were treated with
100 �g/ml gentamicin for 90 min at 37°
C in a 5% CO2 incubator to remove noninternalized bacteria and
then washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Mycobacterial location was analyzed by measuring
luminescence in the supernatant and pellet and also by colony counting on Middlebrook 7H11 agar. For
flow cytometry, PBMCs were infected with GFP-expressing M. tuberculosis at an MOI of 0.1. Microspheres
were made as described above, and on days 0, 1, 4, 7, and 15, microspheres were decapsulated and
stained with allophycocyanin-conjugated anti-human CD14 antibody (ImmunoTools, Friesoythe, Ger-
many). Cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde and analyzed on a BD Accuri C6 flow cytometer. All
events in the high forward and side scatter areas stained with CD14 were included in the analysis. Flow
cytometry data were analyzed with BD Accuri C6 software (ver. 1.0.264.21). Experiments were done at
least two times in triplicate.
Microfluidic system manufacture. The lid template was based on the original plate lid (Berthold
Technologies, United Kingdom). The lid was manufactured from a 5-mm-thick PMMA sheet (Weatherall
Equipment & Instruments Ltd.) by micromilling on a ProtoMat 100 micromill (LPKF Laser & Electronics AG,
Garbsen, Germany). The tools used for fabrication were a 3.00-mm end mill and a 1.59-mm drill (ACS
Industries United Kingdom). The 3.00-mm cutting tool was used to cut out the holding sockets for the
Iso-Disc syringe filters (PTFE-4-4, 4 mm [diameter] by 0.45 �m; Supelco, USA) and to cut out the exact
127.90- by 85.85-mm outline of the lid. The inlets for each well were created by drilling pairs of holes
through with the 1.59-mm drill and then inserting 30-mm (length) by 0.87-mm (inner diameter) by
1.59-mm (outer diameter) stainless steel tubing (Swagelok, United Kingdom). The stainless steel tubing
was terminated with polytetrafluoroethylene tubing (0.75-mm inner diameter) to luer lock syringe
connectors. The outlet port was designed to accommodate the Iso-Disc syringe filter. Three 0.15-mm
holes were drilled through each Iso-Disc syringe filter to allow withdrawal of the liquid from each well
during experiments with a 1-ml syringe (via the outlet port).
Microfluidic experiments. For microfluidic experiments, microspheres were placed in 24-well plates
(Berthold Technologies, United Kingdom) with RPMI without phenol red (Gibco) supplemented with
10 �g/ml ampicillin, 2 mM glutamine, 25 �g/ml kanamycin, and 10% human AB serum (Sigma). M.
tuberculosis Lux luminescence was monitored with a GloMax Discover plate reader (Promega, United
Kingdom). Rifampin was added to cultures at either day 4 or 5. At 9 a.m. each day, wells were treated
with different doses of antibiotic, and after 6 h, wells were irrigated five times with RPMI. A custom-made
mirror was placed under the 24-well clear-bottom plate to maximize luminescence collection for
detection.
