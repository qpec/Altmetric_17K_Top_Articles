The recent ZIKV epidemic in the Americas has been declared a global 
 
public health emergency because of its association with severe fetal 
brain injury during infection of pregnant women. ZIKV is a mosquito-
transmitted flavivirus that generally causes a self-limited febrile syn-
drome characterized by rash, conjunctivitis and arthralgia. However, 
infection in pregnant women is a major concern because the fetus 
may develop a range of brain anomalies, including cerebral atrophy, 
ventriculomegaly, cerebellar hypoplasia and ocular manifestations1. 
Although ZIKV infection can induce fetal demise in mice2–4, the 
 
lack of an experimental animal model of ZIKV infection that closely 
emulates human pregnancy has hindered the ability to directly test 
 
the causal relationship between ZIKV infection and fetal brain injury5. 
Here we describe the development of a pregnant pigtail macaque 
model of ZIKV infection that results in fetal brain lesions. Our results 
confirm the teratogenic potential of ZIKV and will enable testing of 
therapeutics to prevent fetal brain injury.
We inoculated ZIKV (strain FSS13025, Cambodia 2010) sub-
cutaneously in five locations on the forearms of a pregnant pigtail 
macaque at 119 d gestation (corresponding to ~28 weeks of human 
 
pregnancy) to test whether ZIKV causes fetal brain injury. Each of 
the five inoculations consisted of 107 plaque-forming units (p.f.u.) of 
ZIKV. The pregnant animal appeared healthy and did not develop signs 
of rash, conjunctivitis or fever. Cesarean section was performed before 
the onset of labor at 162 d gestation (corresponding to ~38 weeks 
 
of human pregnancy). A weekly ultrasound demonstrated a lag in 
the growth of the fetal biparietal diameter (BPD) (Fig. 1a) that ulti-
mately fell three standard deviations as compared to the published 
ultrasound data for fetal pigtail macaques6. In contrast, the femur con-
tinued to grow normally (Fig. 1b). Baseline imaging of the fetal head 
showed normal architecture of the cerebral hemispheres, ventricles 
 
and posterior fossa; over time, a heterogeneous linear echogenic area 
developed adjacent to the lateral ventricle in the posterior brain of the 
ZIKV-infected animal (Fig. 1c) that was not seen in a control fetus at 
a similar stage of gestation (Fig. 1d).
The first magnetic resonance imaging (MR imaging, or MRI) of the 
fetal brain was performed 10 d following ZIKV inoculation and demon-
strated bilateral periventricular T2 hyperintense foci in the occipital– 
parietal regions surrounding the occipital horns of the lateral ventri-
cles (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Figs. 1–3). This abnormality evolved 
over the course of the study and enlarged on the right; on the left, 
the T2 hyperintense focus became hypointense and was associated 
with volume loss and ventricular collapse. White matter volume did 
not change significantly over the last 3 weeks of the study (17–43 d 
after inoculation), which correlated with the plateau in growth of the 
biparietal diameter on the ultrasound image; in contrast, the gray mat-
ter consistently increased in volume (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. 4 
 
and Supplementary Table 1). The white matter surface area, shape 
and cortical folding continued to evolve (Supplementary Figs. 4 and 5 
 
and Supplementary Table 1). Normally, during the latter half of 
pregnancy in the macaque, the posterior ventricular cerebrospinal 
fluid regions reduce in size relative to the more rapid development

We describe the development of fetal brain lesions after Zika virus 
(ZIKV) inoculation in a pregnant pigtail macaque. Periventricular 
lesions developed within 10 d and evolved asymmetrically in the 
occipital–parietal lobes. Fetal autopsy revealed ZIKV in the brain 
and significant cerebral white matter hypoplasia, periventricular 
white matter gliosis, and axonal and ependymal injury. Our 
observation of ZIKV-associated fetal brain lesions in a nonhuman 
primate provides a model for therapeutic evaluation.

of the parietal and occipital lobes. In contrast, after ZIKV inocula-
tion large posterior ventricular cerebrospinal fluid spaces persisted 
 
into late gestation. The surrounding posterior white matter also 
 
showed enhancement in T2 weighting, indicating increased water 
content (Supplementary Table 1). There was no evidence of cortical 
malformation or abnormalities of the brainstem or cerebellum by 
MR imaging. MR spectroscopy demonstrated a marked reduction 
in N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), a metabolite associated with neuronal 
integrity, in the posterior versus the anterior brain (Supplementary 
Fig. 6). The rapid development of an enhancing T2-weighted fluid 
abnormality suggests that fetal brain injury begins to occur quickly 
following ZIKV infection and may induce periventricular white 
 
matter injury similar to that seen after infection with other viruses 
that cause neonatal encephalitis7,8.
Macroscopic examination of the ZIKV-infected fetal brain revealed 
marked deficiency of the posterior white matter as compared to the 
control fetal brain (Fig. 2a,b). White matter gliosis was present bilat-
erally with many apoptotic and mitotic figures in contrast to the 
control fetus (Fig. 2c–f). Immunohistochemistry revealed increased 
density of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive reactive 
astrocytes, predominantly in the white matter, as compared to the 
control fetus (Fig. 2g,h), and increased CD163-positive microglial 
cells (data not shown). Flow cytometry analysis of matched regions 
of the fetal and maternal brain indicated an enrichment of astro-
cytes in the fetal brain (Supplementary Table 2). Ovoid eosinophilic 
structures were seen in the gliotic white matter that were consist-
ent with axonal spheroids (Fig. 2f, inset), a pathologic sign of axon 
injury. The occipital horn of the right lateral ventricle was mildly 
dilated. There was mild focal gliosis in the gray matter. Notably, there 
was bilateral patchy loss of ventricular ependymal epithelium with 
underlying parenchymal hypercellularity (Supplementary Fig. 7b) 
and increased activated caspase-3 immunoreactivity (Supplementary 
Fig. 7d); CD163-positive histiocytes adhered to the denuded ventricle 
surface (data not shown). In contrast, few caspase-3-immunoreactive 
 
cells were present in the periventricular zone of an uninfected 
fetal control (Supplementary Fig. 7c). Minimal inflammation 
 
was observed in the brain parenchyma and meninges; CD20- and 
CD3-positive cells were rare (not shown). Necrosis, hemorrhage or 
calcifications were absent. Other maternal and fetal organs, including 
 
the fetal brainstem, did not show pathological signs of injury. Placental 
histopathology revealed only mild deciduitis, which was also present 
in some uninfected controls.
Prior to inoculation, serology was negative for previous infection 
with ZIKV, dengue virus (DENV), West Nile virus (WNV) or chikun-
gunya virus (CHIKV) (data not shown). The dam became seropositive 
for ZIKV-specific IgG at 14 d after inoculation and remained positive; 
 
the fetus was seropositive at birth (Supplementary Table 3). At delivery, 
 
ZIKV RNA was detected in the chorionic villous tissue of the placenta, 
 
the fetal brain and liver, and the maternal brain, eyes, spleen and 
liver (Fig. 2i and Supplementary Table 4). Whole-transcriptome 
sequencing analysis of brain tissues identified ZIKV RNA in both 
fetus (1,298 reads per mg tissue) and dam (340 reads per mg tissue), 
with sequence-read coverage across the complete ZIKV genome, 
including the nontranslated regions (Fig. 2j). No viral sequences were 
identified in the brain of an uninfected female pigtail macaque. Viral 
plaque assays on all tissues with detectable ZIKV RNA were negative 
for replicating virus, indicating that either the infection had resolved 
or the level of infectious virus was too low for recovery using standard 
plaque assay methodology.
Our findings of arrested fetal brain growth and viral neuro-invasion 
are consistent with the congenital ZIKV syndrome seen in humans. 
The marked lag in fetal BPD growth by ultrasound analysis reflects the 
arrest of white matter expansion detected by MR imaging. A similar 
arrest in BPD has been reported in human pregnancy with presumed 
ZIKV infection in the third trimester9. In the context of ZIKV infec-
tion, this change in fetal brain growth would be very concerning for

impending microcephaly if given sufficient time, but our experimen-
tal duration was relatively short (a single pregnancy trimester). Viral 
neuro-invasion was supported by detection of ZIKV RNA in the fetal 
and maternal brain, histopathology and fetal serology. The highest 
copy number of ZIKV RNA was found in placental chorionic villous 
tissue, which may be the source of the prolonged viremia that has 
been described in both pregnant humans and rhesus macaques10,11. 
In summary, clinical findings and evidence for viral neuro-invasion is 
highly consistent with vertical transmission, congenital ZIKV infec-
tion and fetal brain injury in our model.
In contrast to our findings, a prior study of ZIKV infection in preg-
nant rhesus macaques did not observe changes in fetal brain growth; 
ZIKV RNA was detected in only a few fetal organs (lymph node, 
bone marrow and optic nerve) in one of three experiments (https://
zika.labkey.com/project/home/begin.view?; last accessed August 1, 
2016)11. Discrepancies may be due to differences in the nonhuman 
primate species used and the inoculum dose. We chose an inoculum 
dose based on a study assessing viral load of WNV; during a mosquito 
bite, inoculated virus ranges from 102–107 infectious viral particles12. 
Mosquitoes typically deposit virus several times as they ‘probe’

before they ‘bite’. A prior study also indicated a viral load of up to 108 
tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID50) in the salivary gland of 
 
the Aedes aegypti mosquito13. Thus, we chose a viral dose at the higher 
end of the spectrum to mimic the multiple probes and bite of an 
infected, feeding mosquito.
We describe the first case of fetal brain injury in a nonhuman 
 
primate after maternal infection with ZIKV. Arrested fetal brain 
growth, white matter injury and detection of ZIKV RNA in multiple 
 
fetal organs (brain, liver and placenta) are similar to features of 
 
the congenital ZIKV syndrome in humans. The distribution of white 
matter injury in this case is predicted to result in visual-field loss 
(injury to optic tracts) and neurodevelopmental delay14. A similar 
but more severe pattern of white matter injury, with involvement of 
the occipital horns of the lateral ventricle, was also seen in a Brazilian 
child with congenital ZIKV infection (Supplementary Fig. 8). We did 
not observe many of the severe findings associated with the congenital 
ZIKV syndrome, but we speculate that this may be due to terminat-
ing the study 6 weeks after inoculation because the pregnancy was 
nearing the due date.
Nonhuman primates are ideal for studying infection in preg-
nancy because they most closely mimic human gestation in many 
key respects, including placentation, gray/white matter ratios in 
the brain and timing of neurodevelopment15. The pigtail macaque 
is known to be susceptible to multiple Flaviviridae family members 
(such as DENV, Japanese encephalitis virus and hepatitis C virus), 
which makes them an excellent model for ZIKV infection16–19. In 
summary, we demonstrate that a clinically inapparent maternal ZIKV 
infection during pregnancy has the capacity to result in fetal brain 
injury in a pregnant pigtail macaque. Further studies are needed to 
investigate the mechanisms of fetal injury. The pigtail macaque model 
may have significant utility for testing novel vaccines and therapeutics 
to prevent the congenital ZIKV syndrome.

Primate experiments. The nonhuman primate experiments were carried 
 
out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the 
 
Care and Use of Laboratory Animals20 of the National Research Council and 
the Weatherall report21. The Institutional Animal Care Use Committee of the 
 
University of Washington approved the study (permit number: 4165-02). 
 
We inoculated ZIKV (strain FSS13025, Cambodia 2010) subcutaneously in 
five separate locations on the forearms, each with 107 plaque-forming units 
(p.f.u.) into a healthy pregnant, 9-year-old pigtail macaque (M. nemestrina) at 
119 d gestation (~28 weeks of human pregnancy) to test directly whether ZIKV 
causes fetal brain injury. At the time of cesarean section and fetal necropsy, 
the fetus was at 162 d gestation (term pregnancy = 172 d).
Definition of fever in the pigtail macaque. The definition of a fever in a pigtail 
macaque is not standardized. A range of rectal temperatures (from 36.6 to 40.1 °C; 
 
average 38.8 °C)22 has been reported in sedated rhesus and cynomolgus 
macaques (M. mulatta and M. fascicularis), which are close relatives to the pigtail 
macaque. Individual variation is thought to relate to excitement before sedation 
and lowering of body temperature during sedation. The highest maternal rectal 
temperature recorded in the study was 38.2 °C (100.8 °F), which was not thought 
to represent a fever.
Ultrasound. Fetal dates were determined initially by measurement of the 
 
crown rump at 45 d; ultrasound measurements of the biparietal diam-
eter (BPD) at 101 d gestation supported the dating. Thereafter, ultrasound 
 
was performed every week from inoculation until delivery. A GE Vivid-i 
 
(GE Medical, Waukesha, WI, USA) machine was used for the first ultrasound, 
and all subsequent measurements were performed on the Philips HD11 machine 
(Philips Healthcare, Bothell, WA, USA). A curvilinear C5-2 MHz transducer 
was used to image the fetus. At least three measurements of the head circumfer-
ence, abdominal circumference, BPD and femur length were acquired, and the 
average was calculated. In addition, at least three ventricular measurements in 
the dependent ventricle, transverse cerebellar diameter and placental thickness 
were acquired, and an average measurement was calculated. At least two cine 
clips were acquired through the head in an axial and coronal orientation, and 
through the chest and abdomen in an axial orientation. Doppler ultrasound of 
the middle cerebral artery was performed to evaluate the flow through the brain. 
Amniotic fluid index was calculated by measuring the fluid pockets in the four 
quadrants. Fetal biometry was compared to known standards for the pigtail 
macaque6. Ultrasound was also performed on a control fetus at 163 d gestation. 
A board-certified radiologist (M.K.D.) with 13 years of experience in obstetric 
ultrasound reviewed the imaging.
Magnetic resonance imaging. MR imaging was performed using a Philips 
Achieva 3T scanner and a multi-element human cardiac radiofrequency (RF) 
coil. Anesthesia was induced using 5–20 mg per kg body weight ketamine and 
maintained using no higher than a 3% sevoflurane–oxygen mixture during the 
imaging. A three-plane localizer using a balanced fast-field echo (FFE) imaging 
sequence was used to determine fetal head position. A two-dimensional (2D) 
single-shot, half-Fourier turbo spin echo multislice sequence was used to acquire 
T2-weighted images with the following parameters: TR/TE = 2,200/160 ms, 
SENSE acceleration factor = 2, TSE factor = 100, along with fat suppression and 
fold-over artifact suppression. Multiple contiguous 2D image stacks, with in-plane 
 
resolutions of 0.5 × 0.5 mm and thicknesses of 2 mm, were acquired along the 
fetal brain axial, sagittal and coronal axes to facilitate the reconstruction of a 
3D volume with isotropic spatial resolution. Each 2-mm-thick plane orienta-
tion was repeated six times to provide high signal-to-noise ratio in the final 
combined 3D reconstruction. Diffusion MR imaging data were also acquired 
but not analyzed in this case report. A pediatric neuroradiologist (D.W
.W
.S.) and 
a pediatric geneticist with expertise in human developmental brain disorders 
(W.B.D.) qualitatively reviewed the MRI images.
To form a single high-resolution 3D T2W image volume for quantitative analysis 
of tissue brain volume and surface anatomy, all multislice T2-weighted image stacks 
were imported into the SLIMMER slice motion correction tool23 implemented 
in the rview software (http://rview.colin-studholme.net, version 9.077.155BQT 
running under Ubuntu release 14) for initial volume-based alignment 
 
to correct for gross drift of the fetal head between slice stacks and to define 
 
a standardized orientation of the fetal head anatomy. Between-slice motion 
occurring due to maternal breathing and fetal head drift was then estimated 
using slice intersection motion correction24. Differences in signal intensity aris-
ing from drift of the fetal head with respect to the imaging coils during scanning 
and from intensity variations due to spin history arising from motion between 
excitation and readout of each individual slice were corrected using slice-inter-
section-bias correction. Then, all slices were combined using an iterative decon-
volution-based super-resolution 3D-scattered data reconstruction technique, 
using robust Huber-norm outlier rejection of any residual within-slice motion 
artifacts25. The final de-convolved isotropic spatial sampling resolution of this 
image was selected to match the in-plane resolution of each slice (0.5 mm).
Each reconstructed 3D brain image volume was first masked to exclude skull 
and maternal tissues. As no age-specific atlas is available for this species, the 
MR imaging scan was roughly segmented into gray matter, white matter and 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) using an initial K-means clustering initiated from a 
manually selected set of voxels in each tissue class. The output of this was then 
extensively manually edited using the review segmentation tool (http://rview.
colin-studholme.net, version 9.077.155BQT running under Ubuntu release 14) 
to divide the tissues further into cortical and deep gray matter, white matter, 
 
cerebellum, sulcal cerebrospinal fluid and ventricular cerebrospinal fluid. 
 
In addition, regions of age-abnormal fluid representing abnormal posterior 
ventricular CSF regions and any surrounding unconnected regions of high 
T2W signal were separately labeled as abnormal fluid volume. From these we 
calculated the total supratentorial cortical gray matter, white matter and deep 
gray matter, the total cerebellum volume and the abnormal fluid volume in 
cubic centimeters. The boundary between the gray and white matter voxels 
was converted to a topologically correct triangular surface mesh with an initial 
voxel-label topology correction using an implementation of Bazin et al.26 and 
then tessellated using an implementation of the marching cubes algorithm. This 
inclusive whole-brain surface includes the regions of the hemispheric connec-
tions and the truncation surface at the brain stem. The area of all triangles in the 
surface was then summed to create a single surface area estimate for the brain 
at each time point in square centimeters.
MR spectroscopy (MRS). Single-voxel MRS was acquired using a point-resolved 
spectroscopy pulse sequence (voxel size: 15 × 12.5 × 15 mm) centered on a fron-
tal region and a posterior region. The structural image was reconstructed in real 
time to guide MRS voxel placement. Acquisition parameters included: repetition 
time TR = 2,000 ms; echo time TE = 32 ms; 2,048 complex free-induction decay 
points, and 2,000-Hz spectral width. Absolute concentrations of metabolites: 
N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), creatine (Cr), choline (Cho), myoinositol (Ins), gluta-
mate (Glu) and glutamate + glutamine (Glx) were calculated using LCModel27. 
Absolute concentrations were obtained by scaling the in vivo spectrum to the 
unsuppressed water peak and are reported in units that approximate millimolar 
concentrations. Partial volume corrections were made by calculating the fraction 
of cerebrospinal fluid for each voxel.
Cultures. Bacterial cultures were performed to exclude microbial infection. 
Amniotic fluid, and maternal and fetal blood, were collected at necropsy and 
plated on tryptic soy agar (TSA) plates and incubated up to 48 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. 
Maternal and fetal meninges and membranes were swabbed and streaked on 
TSA plates and incubated up to 48 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. No bacteria were 
cultured from any these samples.
Serology for WNV, CHIKV, DENV and ZIKV. We used virus-specific ELISA 
assays for ZIKV-, WNV-, CHIKV- or DENV-specific IgG to test ultraviolet- 
inactivated plasma according to the manufacturer’s (Express Biosystems, 
Frederick, MD) instructions. Diluted plasma samples were added to the wells of 
the ELISA plate, which was coated with viral antigens, and incubated at 37 °C for 
45 min. Wells were washed five times, and peroxidase conjugate was added to each 
well and incubated for 45 min at 37 °C. Following incubation, the plate was washed 
five times, followed by the addition of 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline- 
6-sulfonic acid)-peroxidase substrate to each well. The plate was incubated at 
room temperature for 30 min, and the absorbance of the colorimetric reaction 
in each well was read within 15 min on a plate reader at 405 nm.

Immunohistochemistry. The Seattle Children’s Hospital Pathology Department 
performed the immunohistochemistry for GFAP, cleaved caspase-3, CD3, CD20, 
CD163 and neurofilament on formaldehyde-fixed paraffin-embedded sections 
of cerebral cortex from the Zika-exposed fetus and an age-matched control. 
Immunostaining was performed with an automated immunostainer (Ventana, 
Tucson, AZ) using the reagents and dilutions shown in Supplementary Table 5. 
Appropriate peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and diaminobenzidine- 
based reaction product were used to visualize sites of immunoreactivity. 
 
Results were compared to two controls that were close in gestational age 
 
(142 and 155 d gestation).
Cell lines and virus. Vero cells obtained from ATCC were cultured in Dulbecco’s 
modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM; Cellgro) supplemented with 10% FBS 
 
(FBS; Hyclone, Logan, UT), 2 mM l-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 U/mL 
 
penicillin, 100 µg/mL streptomycin and 1× non-essential amino acids (Sigma). 
Zika virus strain FSS13025 was isolated in Cambodia in 2010 and provided by 
the World Reference Center of Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses (WRCEV, 
Galveston, Texas, USA). Working stocks were obtained by plaque-purifying 
 
virus and amplifying once in Vero cells. Virus was adsorbed to cells in DMEM 
supplemented to contain 1% FBS at 37 °C for 2 h. The inoculum was removed, 
and the virus was propagated in medium supplemented to contain 5% FBS, 2 mM 
l-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 µg/mL strepto-
mycin, 20 mM HEPES and 1× non-essential amino acids (Sigma). Supernatants 
were collected and spun at 2,000 r.p.m. at 4 °C for 10 min and frozen in aliquots 
at −80 °C. All of the cell lines used lacked mycoplasma.
Measurement of viral RNA load. Viral RNA load was assessed in tissues from 
the dam, fetus and placenta using a ZIKV-specific RT–qPCR assay. Fetal and 
maternal organs were placed in RNA-later (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) immediately 
after harvest. For analysis of Zika virus RNA in tissue, organs were weighed 
 
and homogenized in buffer RLT (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) using a bead-beater 
apparatus (Precellys, Bertin Corp., Rockville, MD). RNA was extracted from 
tissues using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Following RNA extraction, 
cDNA was synthesized using the iScript select cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad, 
Hercules, CA) according to manufacturer’s protocols for gene-specific primers. 
Viral RNA was quantified using the Taqman Universal Master Mix (Applied 
Biosystems, Waltham, MA) and an Applied Biosystems 7300 RT–PCR machine 
using primers previously described28. Primer sequences listed in Supplementary 
Table 6 correspond to residues in the FSS13025 genome (GenBank accession 
number KU955593). A standard curve was generated by serially diluting a plas-
mid containing residues 699–2,382 of the Zika virus genome. The standard curve 
was used to extrapolate the number of copies of Zika virus RNA per mg of tissue. 
To adhere to stringent guidelines, Ct (cycle threshold) values >38 were deemed 
as not reliably detected and were not reported.
Plaque assay. Monolayers of Vero cells were plated in 6-well plates. Tissue 
homogenates, CSF or viral stocks were serially diluted in DMEM supplemented 
to contain 1% FBS. These dilutions were adsorbed to monolayers of Vero cells 
at 37 °C for 2 h. The inoculum was replaced with a 1% agarose overlay, as previ-
ously described for West Nile Virus29. Five days following inoculation, a second 
1% agarose overlay containing 2% neutral red (Sigma) was added to the cells. 
Plaques were counted 4 h after the second overlay.
Library construction and transcriptome sequencing. Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) 
was depleted from each RNA sample using the Ribo-Zero rRNA Removal Kit 
(Epicentre, Madison, WI) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Libraries 
were prepared from 150 ng of rRNA-depleted RNA following the KAPA 
Stranded RNA-seq with RiboErase workflow for Total RNA-seq libraries (KAPA 
Biosystems, Wilmington, MA). Library quality was evaluated using the Qubit 
3.0 Fluorometer and the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer instrument. Constructed 
libraries were sequenced on a NextSeq 500 Illumina platform, producing 
 
2 × 75 nucleotide stranded paired-end reads (52 Gb).
Data processing and viral read mapping. Quality control of the primary 
sequencing data was performed using FastQC (version 0.11.3) and included 
adaptor trimming using cutadapt (version 1.8.3). FastQC showed good quality 
 
statistics across all samples. Ribosomal RNA reads were removed compu-
tationally using Bowtie2 with an index composed of human, mouse and rat 
rRNA sequences. Sequence reads were trimmed to 50 bp and then aligned to 
the reference FSS13025 genome (Genbank number: KU955593) using Bowtie2 
with default settings. Viral read alignment was visualized using the Integrative 
Genomics Viewer (IGV) tool30,31. Primary Total RNA-seq data from the tempo-
ral lobe of a female, uninfected pigtail macaque (M. nemestrina) was obtained 
through the Nonhuman Primate Reference Transcriptome Resource (http://
www.nhprtr.org) to serve as a control32. All primary sequence data are available 
at Sequence Read Archive (SRA) under the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) 
accession GSE84614. Raw sequence data was uploaded to the GEO and SRA 
databases (GSE84614).
Flow cytometry. Flow cytometry was performed on maternal and fetal brain tis-
sues. To generate single-cell suspensions of brain tissue, each tissue was filtered 
through a 280-µm metal sieve, pelleted at 500g for 5 min, washed once in sterile 
PBS, resuspended in FACS buffer (1 mM EDTA, 25 mM HEPES and 0.1% BSA 
(wt/vol) in PBS) and placed on ice until staining. Single-cell suspensions were 
pelleted at 500g for 5 min and diluted to ~107 cells/mL in FACS buffer. Cell 
suspensions (100 µL) were treated with Fc block (1:200; BD Biosciences) for 
 
15 min at 4 °C. After Fc block treatment, cells were stained with anti-CD56 
 
(1:10; clone B159) for 1 h at 4 °C (all antibodies are from BD Biosciences unless 
noted otherwise). Cells were washed twice in FACS buffer to remove excess 
antibody, fixed for 15 min at 4 °C with 2.0% paraformaldehyde, then permeabi-
lized in 0.1% (vol/vol) Triton X-100 for 15 min at room temperature. Following 
permeabilization, cells were washed once in FACS buffer to remove Triton X-100 
 
and stained with anti-GFAP (1:10; clone REA335; Miltenyi Biotec) for 1 h at 
4 °C. After intracellular staining, cells were washed twice in FACS buffer and 
analyzed using an LSRII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Cell surface and 
intracellular markers were analyzed using FlowJo software version 10.1 (FlowJo). 
Unstained and single-color compensation beads (BD Biosciences) were included 
for compensation.
Approval for de-identified human subjects. The Seattle Children’s Hospital 
Institutional Review Board for Protection of Human Subjects approved the use 
of de-identified MRI images.
