 disease, and other dementias. Our primary hypothesis was that TBI with LOC would be associated 
with increased risk for Alzheimer’s disease and neurofibrillary tangles.
DESIGN—Prospective cohort studies which follow all participants (Religious Orders Study and 
the Memory and Aging Project, ROS and MAP) or all consenting participants (Adult Changes in 
Thought, ACT) to autopsy. Studies performed annual (ROS and MAP) or biennial (ACT) cognitive 
and clinical testing to identify incident cases of dementia and Alzheimer’s disease.
SETTING—Members of a Seattle-area healthcare delivery system (ACT); priests and nuns living 
in orders across the US (ROS), and Chicago-area adults in retirement communities (MAP).
PARTICIPANTS—7,130 older adults; 1,589 came to autopsy.
EXPOSURE—Self reported TBI reported when free of dementia, categorized as <1 hour vs. > 1 
hour of LOC.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES—Clinical: incident all-cause dementia, Alzheimer’s 
disease, and Parkinson’s disease (all studies), and incident mild cognitive impairment and 
progression of parkinsonian signs (ROS and MAP). Neuropathology: neurofibrillary tangles, 
neuritic plaques, microinfarcts, cystic infarcts, Lewy bodies, and hippocampal sclerosis (all 
studies).
RESULTS—865 participants reported a history of TBI with LOC. In >45,000 person-years of 
follow-up, there were 1,537 incident dementia and 117 incident Parkinson’s disease cases. There 
was no association between TBI with LOC and incident dementia or Alzheimer’s disease. There 
were associations between TBI with LOC and incident Parkinson’s disease and progression of 
parkinsonian signs. There was no association between TBI with LOC and neurofibrillary tangles 
or neuritic plaques. There was an association between TBI with LOC and Lewy bodies, and with 
microinfarcts, though numbers of people with these findings were small.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—Pooled clinical and neuropathology data from three 
prospective cohort studies indicate that TBI with LOC is associated with risk of Lewy body 
accumulation, progression of parkinsonism, and Parkinson’s disease, but not dementia, 
Alzheimer’s disease, neuritic plaques, or neurofibrillary tangles.
Each year, many people experience a traumatic brain injury (TBI). Most TBIs are mild, and 
most people return to prior levels of functioning. Worry about late effects of TBI has 
magnified in recent years with media coverage of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) 
in athletes with repetitive head trauma1,2. Head injury is the signature injury of recent 
military conflicts3. Many TBIs are not sports- or combat-related. Characterizing late life 
effects of nonrepetitive TBIs in non-athlete civilians is important4.
Studies assessing TBI’s late effects have been limited with few exceptions2,5 to outcomes 
observed during life. Several studies reported associations between TBI with loss of 
consciousness (TBI with LOC) and Alzheimer’s disease6; the Institute of Medicine 
concluded moderate or severe TBI was an Alzheimer’s disease risk factor7. We sought to 
determine whether there were associations between TBI with LOC and late life dementia, 
including Alzheimer’s disease, and between TBI with LOC and Alzheimer’s related 
neuropathologic changes. We hypothesized that TBI with LOC causes accumulation of

 neurofibrillary tangles and increased Alzheimer’s disease risk. We also assessed associations 
with Parkinson’s disease, parkinsonism, Lewy bodies, and other neuropathologic changes.
Methods
Overview
We evaluated data from three prospective cohort studies, the Adult Changes in Thought 
(ACT) study, the Religious Orders Study (ROS), and the Memory and Aging Project (MAP). 
ROS and MAP were designed to have consistent data acquisition and processing and are 
analyzed jointly in numerous manuscripts. ROS and MAP TBI exposure rates were similar; 
we combined their data. For all participants, we evaluated associations between TBI and late 
life clinical outcomes including dementia and Alzheimer’s disease (all 3 studies), mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI; ROS and MAP), Parkinson’s disease (all 3 studies), and change 
in parkinsonian signs (ROS and MAP). For those who consented and came to brain autopsy, 
we evaluated associations between TBI and neuropathologic findings (all 3 studies).
Parent Studies
ROS started in 1994 and enrolled older religious clergy from >40 groups across the United 
States. MAP started in 1997 and enrolled older residents from Chicago-area retirement 
facilities and subsidized housing, and through church groups and social service agencies. 
ACT started in 1994 and enrolled older Seattle-area Group Health members. Detailed study 
design and data collection procedures are published.8–12
TBI Ascertainment
All studies assessed head injuries at enrollment and every study visit, and all captured TBI 
with LOC; exposure data were collected when participants were known not to have 
dementia. In ACT, an initial item ascertains whether participants had “an injury so severe 
that you lost consciousness.” If that item is endorsed, subsequent items address type of 
injury including head injury and LOC duration. In ROS and MAP, participants are asked 
whether they have ever had a head injury, and if so, whether they ever lost consciousness and 
LOC duration. We provide further details in Supplemental Methods S1.
Dementia and Alzheimer’s Disease Ascertainment, ACT
Methods for identifying dementia cases are published10–12. Participants were screened every 
two years with the Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument (CASI)13, a 100-point brief 
cognitive assessment. Participants with CASI scores <86 underwent a standardized 
diagnostic evaluation, including physical and neurological examinations and a 
neuropsychological test battery. Dementia diagnoses were determined at consensus 
conferences using DSM-IV criteria14, and Alzheimer’s disease using NINCDS-ADRDA 
criteria15. Additional details are provided in Supplemental Methods S2.

 Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), Dementia, and Alzheimer’s Disease Ascertainment, ROS 
and MAP
Cognitive function in ROS and MAP was assessed annually using a battery of 21 tests with 
19 tests in common.16 Computer-scored results were reviewed by a neuropsychologist to 
diagnose cognitive impairment. Participants were then evaluated by a clinician who used 
cognitive and clinical data to identify Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias.17 MCI was 
defined as cognitive impairment in the absence of dementia. Detailed methods are 
published17,18 and are provided in Supplemental Methods S2.
Parkinsonian Features and Parkinson’s Disease Ascertainment
We used pharmacy and ICD9 data in ACT and self-report data from ROS and MAP to 
identify Parkinson’s disease; see Supplemental Methods S3. In ROS and MAP, parkinsonian 
features are assessed at every study visit using a modified version of the motor section of the 
Unified Parkinson’s Disease rating Scale (mUPDRS19); see Supplemental Methods S4.
Neuropathology Protocols
Neuropathology protocols are published for ACT20,21 and ROS and MAP9,18,22,23; details 
are provided in Supplemental Methods S5. We evaluated neurofibrillary degeneration as 
measured by Braak stage24, neuritic plaque frequency according to Consortium to Establish 
a Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease (CERAD)25, presence of cerebral amyloid angiopathy, 
presence of macroscopic infarcts, presence of hippocampal sclerosis, presence and location 
of cerebral microinfarcts categorized as deep (basal ganglia or thalamus) vs. cortical, and 
presence and location of Lewy bodies categorized as present in the substantia nigra or locus 
ceruleus, in the frontal or temporal cortex, or in the amygdala. We dichotomized each 
neuropathologic measure as high vs. low/none based on associations with dementia21. High 
measures included Braak stage V or VI, intermediate or frequent CERAD scores, any 
amyloid angiopathy, any macroscopic infarcts, any microinfarcts, and any Lewy body.
Covariate Ascertainment
Age, sex, and years of education were self-reported. APOE genotype was obtained from 
consenting individuals. We adjusted models for APOE genotype as presence of ≥1 APOE ε4 
alleles, and tested for interactions with APOE genotype and with sex.
Standard Protocol Approvals, Registrations, and Patient Consents
Studies were approved by Group Health, University of Washington, and Rush University 
Medical Center Institutional Review Boards. Participants provided written informed consent. 
ROS and MAP participants sign an Anatomic Gift Act donating their brain, and 25–30% of 
ACT participants consent to brain donation.
Statistical Analysis
We used Stata 13.1 for all analyses. We categorized duration of LOC as none vs. ≤1 hour vs. 
>1 hour. We adjusted models for age at study entry, sex, education, and study cohort. 
Proportional hazards and other model assumptions were tenable for incident Parkinson’s 
disease, so we used Cox models for that outcome. We used Weibull models for analyses of

 dementia, MCI, and Alzheimer’s disease. We used ordinal mixed effects models to analyze 
parkinsonian signs; see Supplemental Methods S4 for additional details. We used Poisson 
regression models for neuropathology outcomes.
We noted that most of the participants who reported TBI with LOC > 1 hour were younger 
than age 25 at the time of their TBI, so we repeated analyses comparing individuals with 
TBI with LOC before age 25 to people who never reported a TBI with LOC; for these 
sensitivity analyses we censored people who had a TBI with LOC after age 25.
Results
There were 7,130 people with head injury data at enrollment; 4,265 (60%) from ACT and 
2,865 (40%) from ROS and MAP. In ACT, there were 643 (15%) people who reported a TBI 
with LOC at enrollment, and in ROS and MAP, there were 222 (8%). Proportions of people 
reporting TBI with LOC >1 hour were more similar, with 94 from ACT (2.2%) and 48 from 
ROS and MAP (1.7%). These rates of TBI exposure are intermediate between those reported 
based on hospital data26 and based on extensive injury history questionnaires27. 
Demographic characteristics stratified by history of TBI and duration of LOC are shown in 
Tables 1 and 2.
Incident MCI, Dementia, and Alzheimer’s Disease
In ACT, people with prevalent dementia were not enrolled. One participant was missing 
educational attainment data. There were 4,626 participants. Of these, 3,666 (86%) had ≥1 
follow-up visit. They had a median of 6.2 years of follow-up (interquartile range, IQR, 3.9–
11.1 years), with a mean (standard deviation, SD) of 7.8 (5.0) years. We identified 921 
incident cases of dementia and 759 of Alzheimer’s disease in 28,664 person-years of follow-
up. There was no statistically significant relationship between TBI with LOC and dementia 
risk. Compared with people with no TBI with LOC, people with LOC < 1 hour had an 
adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 1.03 (95% confidence interval, CI, 0.83, 1.27) and those with a 
TBI with LOC >1 hour had an adjusted HR 1.18 (0.77, 1.78).
In ROS and MAP, 2 participants were missing educational attainment data, and 174 had 
prevalent dementia. There were 2,689 remaining participants. Of these, 2,452 (92%) had ≥1 
follow-up visit. They had a median (IQR) of 4.7 (2.0–8.0) years of follow-up, with a mean 
(SD) of 5.5 (4.1) years. We identified 616 incident dementia cases and 563 of Alzheimer’s 
disease in 16,526 person-years of follow-up. There was no statistically significant 
relationship between TBI with LOC and dementia risk. The HR (95% CI) for TBI with LOC 
< 1 hour was 0.87 (0.58, 1.29), and for TBI with LOC ≥ 1 hour it was 0.84 (0.44, 1.57).
Including APOE genotype did not change findings in either study and there were no 
significant interactions with APOE genotype (Supplemental Results S1) or sex 
(Supplemental Results S2). Results for Alzheimer’s disease were similar to those for 
dementia (Supplemental Results S1). There was no association between TBI with LOC and 
incident MCI in ROS and MAP (Supplemental Results S1). When we grouped by age at TBI 
exposure, there was no statistically significant association between TBI with LOC and MCI, 
dementia, or Alzheimer’s disease (Supplemental Results S1). It made little difference when

 we used the most recent rather than earliest TBI with LOC in ACT (Supplemental Results 
S1).
Incident Parkinson’s Disease and Progression of Parkinsonian Signs
We excluded 39 people with prevalent Parkinson’s disease at enrollment in ACT, leaving 
3,627 with ≥1 follow-up. We identified 83 incident Parkinson’s disease cases in 22,800 
person-years of follow-up. The adjusted HR (95% CI) for a TBI with <1 hour LOC was 0.66 
(0.28, 1.52), while that for TBI with >1 hour LOC was 3.56 (1.52, 8.28).
We excluded 29 people with prevalent Parkinson’s disease at enrollment in ROS and MAP, 
leaving 2,437 with ≥1 follow-up. We identified 34 incident Parkinson’s disease cases in 
18,156 person-years of follow-up. Only 3 of those who developed incident Parkinson’s 
disease had reported exposure to TBI with LOC, all of whom had duration of LOC <1 hour. 
Regression results were unstable for TBI with LOC <1 hour, and undefined for TBI with 
LOC>1 hour.
For evaluation of the progression of parkinsonian signs, we controlled analyses for baseline 
age, sex, and time since baseline, and used the 8-point ordinal variable described in 
Supplemental Methods S3. The adjusted OR for increasing scores for a history of TBI-LOC 
was 1.75 (1.33, 2.29).
Neuropathological Findings at Autopsy
Of the 4,265 ACT participants who had TBI data from study enrollment, autopsy data were 
available for 525 of 2,022 deaths. Of the 2,643 ROS and MAP participants who had TBI 
data at study enrollment, autopsy data were available for 1,064 of 1,332 deaths. 
Demographic characteristics were similar to those for the entire cohorts; see Supplemental 
Results S3. The frequency of neuropathological findings is shown in Supplemental Results 
S4. Regression results for ACT and ROS and MAP separately are shown in Table 3. There 
was no association between TBI with LOC <1 hour and any neuropathological finding 
except Lewy bodies in frontal or temporal cortex in ROS and MAP. People with TBI with 
LOC>1 hour had increased risk for cerebral microinfarcts in ROS and MAP and 
hippocampal sclerosis and Lewy bodies in ACT. There were no interactions with APOE 
genotype (Supplemental Results S5) or sex (Supplemental Results S6).
Regression results from pooled analyses are shown in Table 4. In pooled analyses, TBI with 
LOC<1 hour was associated with increased risk for Lewy bodies in frontal or temporal 
cortex, and TBI with LOC>1 hour was associated with increased risk of cerebral 
microinfarcts.
More than a third of TBI with LOC<1 hour and nearly half of TBI with LOC>1 hour 
occurred at age<25. Among people with TBI with LOC before age 25, TBI with LOC>1 
hour was associated with increased risk of microinfarcts and Lewy bodies, especially in 
frontal or temporal cortex (Table 5).

 Discussion
In three prospective cohort studies of older adults free of dementia at baseline and followed 
for nearly 45,000 person-years, we did not find associations between TBI with LOC and risk 
of incident MCI, AD, or dementia. There were 1,537 incident dementia cases across the 
three studies, of which 1,322 were incident Alzheimer’s disease; we had substantial power 
for these outcomes. We did not find associations between TBI with LOC and neurofibrillary 
degeneration or neuritic plaques, though Braak stage V or VI (30% in ACT, 24% in ROS 
and MAP) and intermediate or frequent neuritic plaques by CERAD (50% in ACT, 66% in 
ROS and MAP) were common. Including APOE genotype had negligible impact on our 
results, and we did not find different risk among APOE ε4 carriers. Our total autopsy sample 
size (1,652 autopsies) is nearly 7 times a previous evaluation of associations between TBI 
exposure and Alzheimer’s pathology; those investigators found relationships with 
neocortical plaques and sex differences that are not confirmed in our study5.
Parkinson’s disease (total of 117 incident cases) and parkinsonian signs are less common 
than dementia. Despite lower power, we found associations between TBI with LOC > 1 hour 
and progression of parkinsonian signs (in ROS and MAP) and risk for incident Parkinson’s 
disease (in ACT); there were no Parkinson’s disease cases with that exposure in ROS and 
MAP.
Lewy bodies are less common (17% in ACT, 22% in ROS and MAP) than neuritic plaques, 
neurofibrillary tangles, or microinfarcts, but we found associations between TBI with LOC 
and Lewy body accumulation. Despite lower power, we found associations between TBI 
with LOC>1 hour and Lewy body accumulation in substantia nigra or locus ceruleus in ACT 
and in frontal or temporal cortex in ACT. We found associations between TBI with LOC < 1 
hour and frontal or temporal cortex Lewy bodies in ROS and MAP, and the point estimate 
was similar for ACT, though ACT’s confidence interval included 1. In pooled analyses, we 
found associations between TBI with LOC>1 hour and cerebral cortical Lewy bodies. A 
recent paper showed an association between TBI in mid life with development of 
Parkinson’s disease a few years later28. Some features of synucleinopathies have been 
identified decades in advance of clinical disease, so it is possible that the higher rates of TBI 
with LOC in this group are the result of, rather than the cause of, Parkinson’s disease. We 
suspect that explanation may be less likely here, where for many individuals exposure was 
four or more decades preceding Parkinson’s disease. A prior study of TBI exposure and 
neuropathological outcomes excluded people with diffuse Lewy bodies from analyses.5
Cerebral microinfarcts were common (43% in ACT and 36% in ROS and MAP). TBI with 
LOC > 1 hour was associated with an increased risk of cortical microinfarcts in ACT. The 
point estimate was elevated in ROS and MAP, though the confidence interval included 1. 
The pooled analyses showed an association between TBI with LOC > 1 hour and cerebral 
cortical microinfarcts. Microinfarcts were identified on hematoxylin and eosin stained 
sections; more may have been identified if other stains had been used.
Limitations to this study warrant consideration. The study cohorts may not be broadly 
representative of the more ethnically diverse United States population. As in all cohort

 studies, unmeasured and residual confounding are always possibilities. Data from the three 
studies were carefully harmonized, autopsies were performed by highly experienced 
neuropathologists using standard research protocols, and dementia diagnoses were obtained 
by expert clinicians using research quality guidelines; still, systematic differences may be 
present. TBI ascertainment methods varied across studies and were limited to self-report. 
Nevertheless, TBI exposure was ascertained at a time when participants were known not to 
be demented, and before the development of incident conditions and neuropathological 
evaluations described here. For Parkinson’s disease diagnosis we were limited to self-report 
in two studies and medications and ICD9 codes in the other. We performed many tests, and 
did not alter our threshold for statistical significance, so it may be prudent to consider our 
results to be hypothesis generating. Some potentially important confounders were omitted, 
such as occupational history, smoking, physical activity, body mass index, risk taking, and 
alcohol intake. There is substantial interest in effects of repetitive TBI, but numbers of 
participants with >1 TBI with LOC were too small to analyze. We did not have data on 
athletic or military exposures, and the autopsy protocol did not include specific evaluation of 
chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE)29. The ACT neuropathology protocol did not 
specifically include evaluation of diffuse plaques, and none of the protocols were not 
designed specifically for detection of TBI-related neuropathology. The parent studies were 
designed to study late-onset Alzheimer’s disease, and do not provide information about 
possible relationships between TBI and early-onset Alzheimer’s disease. Reverse causation 
may be a concern in cohort studies with short intervals between exposure and outcome. This 
is less of a concern here as in sensitivity analyses we limited exposure to people younger 
than age 25. Even in that case, we found increased risk of Lewy body accumulation and 
microinfarcts among people enrolled after age 65 and thus had >40 years lag between 
exposure and outcome (see Supplemental eFigure 2).
Several previous studies have suggested associations between TBI with LOC and 
Alzheimer’s disease.30 To our knowledge this is by far the largest study ever on this topic. 
With more than adequate power to detect an association between TBI with LOC and 
Alzheimer’s disease, we found no such association. We found that TBI with LOC was 
associated with Lewy body accumulation, progression of parkinsonian features, and risk for 
incident Parkinson’s disease. These results suggest that a single TBI with LOC is not 
associated with increased risk for clinical Alzheimer’s disease or the accumulation of 
neuritic plaques or neurofibrillary degeneration, but rather that the late life effects of TBI 
may include Lewy bodies, microinfarcts, Parkinson’s disease, and parkinsonism. TBI with 
LOC sustained early in life is not innocuous, and appears to be associated with 
neurodegenerative conditions, though not Alzheimer’s disease.
