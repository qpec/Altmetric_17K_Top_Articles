Short title: Child physical illness and adult mental health

Abstract 
Background: Childhood chronic physical illness is associated with a greater vulnerability for 
emotional problems (i.e., depression and anxiety) in childhood. However, little is known about 
life-long effects of childhood chronic physical illness on mental health. The present study aims 
to systematically review evidence for associations between eight chronic physical illnesses with 
childhood onset (arthritis, asthma, cancer, chronic renal failure, congenital heart disease, cystic 
fibrosis, type 1 diabetes, and epilepsy) and adult emotional problems. 
Methods: A database search of MEDLINE, PsycARTICLES, PsycINFO, and ScienceDirect was 
undertaken, and random effects meta-analyses were used to synthesize evidence from eligible 
studies.  
Results: In total, 37 studies were eligible for the systematic review (n = 45,733) and of these, 34 
studies were included into the meta-analyses (n = 45,358). There were overall associations 
between childhood chronic physical illness and adult depression (OR = 1.31; 95% CI [1.12, 
1.54]) and anxiety (OR = 1.47; 95% CI [1.13, 1.92]). Separate meta-analyses for childhood 
asthma, type 1 diabetes and cancer were also conducted, with cancer being significantly 
associated with adult depression (OR = 1.19; 95% CI [1.00, 1.42]).  
Conclusions: The effects of childhood chronic physical illness on the risk of emotional problems 
persist beyond childhood and adolescence. Mental health prevention and intervention strategies 
targeting children with chronic physical illnesses can have long-term benefits.

Childhood chronic physical illness is defined as a health problem lasting three months or more, 
affecting the child’s normal activities, resulting in functional limitations, dependencies or the need 
for hospitalization or health care (Stein, Bauman, Westbrook, Coupey, & Ireys, 1993). This refers to 
a wide range of disorders, including highly prevalent conditions with serious disabling 
consequences, such as arthritis, asthma, cancer, chronic renal failure, congenital heart disease, 
cystic fibrosis, type 1 diabetes, and epilepsy. In the past four decades, with advances of medical 
therapies, nearly 20% of children and adolescents with chronic physical illnesses live for a long 
time (Perrin, Bloom, & Gortmaker, 2007; van der Lee, Mokkink, Grootenhuis, Heymans, & 
Offringa, 2007). This highlights the increasing need for investigations into effects of these 
conditions on life-long mental health and wellbeing. 
Recent meta-analyses indicate that children with chronic physical illnesses have greater 
vulnerability to psychosocial problems in childhood and adolescence (Pinquart & Shen, 2011b, 
2011c). These children face significant challenges due to their physical conditions which might 
disrupt their psychological well-being (Ferro, Boyle, & Avison, 2015). Psychological problems in 
childhood are known to be precursors to poor mental health in adulthood, and previous research has 
suggested that, as children with chronic physical illnesses grow older, their psychosocial problems 
may either decrease, or persist and become more severe with time (Huurre & Aro, 2002; Pless, 
Power, & Peckham, 1993). However, there is limited evidence for the link between different 
childhood chronic physical illnesses and common mental health problems in adulthood. To our 
knowledge, the only one, non-systematic, review on this subject was conducted more than 15 years 
ago (Gledhill, Rangel, & Garralda, 2000). This review showed mixed evidence for the risk of adult 
mental health problems across different types of childhood chronic physical illness. A 
comprehensive systematic review of associations between childhood chronic physical illness and 
adult emotional problems is an important step for developing more targeted and effective preventive 
intervention strategies. The present paper aims to systematically review and analyze the evidence 
from studies investigating the effects of different types of childhood chronic physical illness that are 
  
4 
 
highly prevalent (such as arthritis, asthma, cancer, congenital heart disease, cystic fibrosis, type-1 
diabetes, and epilepsy ) and/or understudied (such as arthritis and chronic renal failure), on adult 
emotional problems (i.e., depression, anxiety). 
 
Method 
Search Strategy 
This review was conducted in accordance with the MOOSE (Meta-analysis Of 
Observational Studies in Epidemiology) guidelines (Stroup et al., 2000). A systematic database 
search including titles and abstracts from January 1980 to July 2016 was performed using 
PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, MEDLINE (National Library of Medicine), and ScienceDirect 
(Elsevier) databases. The following search terms were used: (“chronic illness” OR “chronic 
disease” OR “chronic disability” OR “chronic physical illness” OR “arthritis” OR “asthma” OR 
“cancer” OR “cystic fibrosis” OR “diabetes” OR “epilepsy” OR “rheumatism” OR “congenital 
heart disease” OR “chronic renal failure”) combined with age related search terms (i.e., “child*” 
OR “adolesc*” OR “pediatr*” OR “youth”) and psychosocial outcome related search terms (i.e., 
“depress*” OR “anxi*” OR “fear” OR “panic” OR “mental health” OR “psychological health” ) 
combined with (“adult*” OR “adolesc*”) using the Boolean operator “AND”. Pilot searches were 
conducted in order to test the sensitivity and specificity of the search terms. Reference lists and 
citations of eligible articles were examined for identification of any eligible study not previously 
located through the database search.  
Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria 
Original studies published in English in peer-reviewed journals were included. Review 
papers, book chapters, conference proceedings and dissertations were excluded. Studies were 
included if they used longitudinal prospective, cross-sectional, or case-control designs. Case reports 
and studies without valid control groups were excluded. From studies with overlapping samples, the 
most relevant and/or recent study was selected.

Measures of childhood chronic physical included self-reports, parental reports and medical 
reports; with first illness diagnosis or measurement before the age of 16. Eight chronic physical 
illnesses with childhood onset were included: arthritis (i.e., rheumatism or rheumatoid arthritis), 
asthma, cancer, chronic renal failure, congenital heart disease, cystic fibrosis, type 1 diabetes, and 
epilepsy. Intellectual disability and neurodevelopmental disorders were excluded from the list of 
childhood chronic physical illnesses, because our primary aim was to explore the effects of chronic 
physical conditions. If intellectual disability/neurodevelopmental disorder was reported in addition 
to chronic physical illness, this study would have been included, however no such studies were 
identified. Studies with participants who were symptomatic, asymptomatic, in remission, or cured 
of childhood chronic physical illness at the time of study were considered eligible.  
Both diagnostic as well as dimensional measures of depression, anxiety, and unspecified 
emotional problems, reported after the age of 16 were considered eligible. The age 16 was used as a 
threshold for the onset of the childhood chronic physical illness; and in order to be as inclusive as 
possible we set up the age above 16 as a threshold for inclusion of later mental health problems. 
Diagnostic outcomes included: unipolar depressive episode, major depression, generalized anxiety 
disorder, panic disorder, phobias, social anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive-
compulsive disorder, or health anxiety based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 
Disorders, Research Diagnostic Criteria, International Classification of Diseases, or other 
psychiatric or psychological evaluations. Dimensional outcomes of depression, anxiety or 
unspecified emotional symptoms on standardized scales were also eligible. Participants were 
excluded if they had other mental health problems (e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, learning 
disability, substance abuse) in addition to depression and/or anxiety. 
Eligibility criteria were applied during two phases: 1) title and abstract screening, and 2) full 
text screening. A second independent evaluator screened 10% of the title and abstracts, and 10% of 
full texts. Any discrepancies were resolved during consensus meetings.

Data Extraction 
A coding form was created to record each study’s key information. Effect sizes for 
depression, anxiety and unspecified emotional symptoms were coded individually. The quality of 
each study was assessed using the STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies 
in Epidemiology) guidelines (Elm et al., 2007). 
Data Synthesis and Statistical Analyses 
 
Analyses were conducted using the metafor package for R (v.3.2). Odds ratios (ORs) were 
estimated from available descriptive statistics using standard computational techniques for 
dichotomous and continuous data (Borenstein, Hedges, Higgins, & Rothstein, 2009; Field & Gillett, 
2010) when not reported in the original studies. Log ORs were computed for the meta-analyses. 
Random-effects meta-analyses were performed separately for each outcome (i.e., depression, 
anxiety, and unspecified emotional symptoms). First, associations with specific chronic physical 
illnesses were tested. Then, the overall association with any type of childhood chronic physical 
illness was investigated. Heterogeneity of effect sizes was tested using the Cochrane Q and I² 
statistics to examine and quantify the amount of observed variance accounted for by true 
heterogeneity rather than sampling error (Higgins, Thompson, Deeks, & Altman, 2003). Summary 
statistics of log ORs and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were exponentiated to allow ease of 
interpretation.  
Effects of possible moderators, such as age at diagnosis of childhood chronic physical 
illness, duration of illness, time elapsed between the onset of the childhood illness and adult mental 
health, type of measure of childhood chronic physical illness (medical record versus self-report), 
type of sample (community versus clinical), and age and sex of participants were also investigated 
with meta-regression analyses.  
To determine if publication bias was present, Begg’s funnel plot, Egger’s test of asymmetry, 
and trim-and-fill adjustment methods were used.

Results 
The search identified 3,170 sources. After exclusion of duplicates, book chapters and 
dissertations, 2,495 titles and abstracts were extracted for screening. At phase one, 2,495 papers 
were screened and 161 papers were selected for full-text screening. There was 95% inter-rater 
agreement (k = .73, 95% CI [0.66, 0.80], p <.001). At phase two, additional 18 articles were 
identified from the reference lists, resulting in 179 full texts for screening. There was 89% inter-
rater agreement (k = .68, 95% CI [0.48, 0.88], p = .002). The disagreements were resolved during a 
number of consensus meetings.

----------------------------------------------- 
A total of 37 studies were identified as eligible for the systematic review (Table 1): asthma 
(k = 6), cancer (k = 18), congenital heart disease (k = 3), cystic fibrosis (k = 2), diabetes (k = 8), 
epilepsy (k = 4), and rheumatoid arthritis (k = 1). No eligible studies of chronic renal failure were 
found.  
 ---------------------------------------------- 
Table 1 here 
---------------------------------------------- 
Of the 37 studies identified, three had insufficient information to calculate effect sizes 
(Baca, Vickrey, Vassar, & Berg, 2015; Eddington, Mullins, Fedele, Ryan, & Junghans, 2010; 
Tluczek et al., 2014). Therefore, 34 studies (n = 45,358) were used for the meta-analyses. In several 
studies, effect sizes were reported individually for each sex, age group, chronic illness, mental 
health outcome, resulting in 48 effect sizes in total, including 33 effect sizes for depression (Figure 
2), 25 - for anxiety (Figure 3), and 26 - for unspecified emotional problems (Figure 4).  
Of the 16 studies that reported the associations between childhood chronic physical illness 
and anxiety, ten studies used a general (unspecified) measure of anxiety (Alwash, Hussein, &

Matloub, 2000; Baldin et al., 2015; Ferro, Boyle & Avison, 2015; Gianinazzi et al., 2013; Kremer et 
al., 2016; Ly et al., 2011; Michel et al., 2010; Muller, Hess, & Hager, 2013; Servitzoglu et al., 2008; 
Zeltzer et al., 2008), and three studies focused on Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) (Brown, 
Madan-Swain, & Lambert, 2003; Kamibeppu et al., 2010; Schwartz & Drotar, 2006). Two studies 
reported the associations between childhood chronic illness and PTSD as well as general anxiety 
(Kazak et al., 2010; Seitz et al., 2010). One study explored the association between childhood 
chronic illness and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) as well as general anxiety (Sivertsen et 
al., 2014). 
Associations with specific types of childhood chronic physical illnesses 
Asthma 
A total of 2,975 participants with childhood asthma (Mage = 19.9) and 9,655 physically 
healthy controls (Mage = 20.1) took part in six studies. A meta-analysis of the four studies that 
measured depression (Chaney et al., 1999; Chen et al., 2014; Ferro et al., 2016; Kokkonen, 2001) 
showed that adults with childhood asthma did not have a higher risk of depression as compared to 
controls (OR = 1.64; 95% CI [0.82, 3.28]). Two studies measured emotional symptoms using the 
mental component of a health related quality of life scale and reported lower risk of emotional 
symptoms for individuals without asthma (Eddington et al., 2010; Fedele et al., 2009). Only one 
study measured anxiety and reported no differences between participants with childhood asthma 
and controls (Ferro et al., 2016). 
Cancer 
A total of 13,094 participants with childhood cancer and 7,079 healthy controls were 
included across 18 studies (Brown, Madan-Swain, & Lambert, 2003; Gianinazzi et al., 2013; Gunn 
et al., 2013; Harila, Niinivirta, Winqvist, & Harila-Saari, 2011; Kamibeppu et al., 2010; Kazak et 
al., 2010; Kremer, Schieber, Metzler, Schuster, & Erim, 2016; Mackie, Hill, Kondryn, & McNally, 
2000; Maunsell, Pogany, Barrera, Shaw, & Speechley, 2006; Michel, Rebholz, von der Weid, 
Bergstraesser, & Kuehni, 2010; Schwartz & Drotar, 2006; Seitz et al., 2010; Servitzoglou,

Papadatou, Tsiantis, & Vasilatou-Kosmidis, 2008; Stam, Grootenhuis, Caron, & Last, 2006; 
Sundberg et al., 2010; Teta et al., 1986; Zeltzer et al., 1997; Zeltzer et al., 2008). On average, cancer 
survivors were 28.8 years old, and controls were 26.3 years old, as reported in 17 studies. Cancer 
survivors’ mean age at illness diagnosis was 8.5 years (computed from 15 studies). The mean time 
since illness diagnosis was reported in eleven studies, with an average of 22.0 years.  
A meta-analysis of the 18 effect sizes showed that a history of childhood cancer was 
significantly associated with adult depression (OR = 1.19; 95% CI [1.00, 1.42]). A meta-analysis of 
17 effect sizes indicated that a history of childhood cancer was not significantly associated with 
adult anxiety (OR = 1.35; 95% CI [0.97, 1.89]). A meta-analysis of 18 effect sizes indicated that a 
history of childhood cancer was not significantly associated with adult unspecified emotional 
symptoms (OR = 1.06; 95% CI [0.95, 1.19]).  
Type 1 Diabetes 
A total of 548 participants with diabetes and 10,379 healthy controls took part across eight 
studies (Blanz, Rensch-Riemann, Fritz-Sigmund, & Schmidt, 1993; Kokkonen, 2001; Kremer et al., 
2016; Ly, Anderson, McNamara, Davis, & Jones, 2011; Northam, Lin, Finch, Werther, & Cameron, 
2010; Palladino et al., 2013; Sivertsen, Petrie, Wilhelmsen-Langeland, & Hysing, 2014; Tebbi, 
Bromberg, Sills, Cukierman, & Piedmonte, 1990). On average, participants with diabetes were 20.4 
years old and controls were 19.7 years old. The prospective studies followed the participants up to 
12 years (k = 3). Three studies reported the age at diabetes diagnosis, with the mean of 7.6 years. 
Four studies reported mean time since the illness diagnosis, with an average of 9.0 years. 
A meta-analysis did not find a significant association between childhood-onset diabetes and 
depression (OR = 1.36; 95% CI [0.80, 2.31]). Only three studies investigated anxiety, with two 
showing non-significant differences between individuals with childhood-onset diabetes and controls 
(Ly et al., 2011; Sivertsen et al., 2014), and only one indicating a higher level of anxiety for 
participants with childhood-onset diabetes (Kremer et al., 2016). Of the three studies that 
investigated unspecified symptoms, two showed that people with diabetes had higher symptom 
  
10 
 
levels compared to controls (Blanz et al., 1993; Tebbi et al., 1990), and one study found non-
significant differences (Northam et al., 2010). Meta-analyses for these studies were not conducted. 
Other childhood chronic physical illnesses 
We were not able to perform separate meta-analyses for any other specific childhood 
illnesses because of insufficient number of studies (k < 4). For congenital heart disease, there were 
three samples, of which two were from the same study – therefore a separate-meta-analysis was not 
conducted. Below we present the narrative analyses for the studies included in the systematic 
literature review. 
Congenital Heart Disease: A total of 999 participants with congenital heart disease (Mage = 
27.7) and 229 healthy controls (Mage = 25.4) took part in three studies. One study focused on 
individuals who had undergone a Fontan corrective procedure, and reported that individuals with 
congenital heart disease had higher level of depression than healthy controls (Pike et al., 2012). 
However, other studies did not find significant association between congenital heart disease and 
depressive (Kokkonen, 2001), anxiety, or unspecified emotional symptoms (Muller, Hess, & Hager, 
2013). 
Cystic Fibrosis: A total of 141 participants (68 with cystic fibrosis and 73 healthy controls) 
took part in two studies (Blair, Cull, & Freeman, 1994; Tluczek et al., 2014). On average, 
participants with cystic fibrosis were 18.6 years old, and the healthy controls were 18.0 years old. 
Both studies investigated unspecified emotional symptoms and found non-significant association.  
Epilepsy: A total of 528 participants with childhood-onset epilepsy and 440 physically 
healthy controls took part in four studies (Alwash, Hussein, & Matloub; Baca et al., 2015; Baldin, 
Hesdorffer, Caplan, & Berg, 2015; Kokkonen, 2001). Three studies reported the mean age of 
participants, as 22.36 for individuals with epilepsy and 22.5 for healthy controls. Two studies 
reported mean age at illness diagnosis as 7.6 years. One study reported that individuals with 
epilepsy had a significantly higher prevalence of depression and anxiety compared to controls 
(Alwash et al., 2000). Other studies found non-significant differences between individuals with and 
  
11 
 
without childhood epilepsy for depression (Kokkonen, 2001), anxiety (Baldin et al., 2015) and 
unspecified symptoms (Baca et al., 2015). 
Rheumatoid Arthritis: One study of 35 participants with rheumatoid arthritis and 123 
healthy controls found no association between rheumatoid arthritis and adult depression (Kokkonen, 
2001). 
Overall association with childhood chronic physical illness  
A meta-analysis showed that, compared to those without a history of childhood chronic 
physical illness, adults with childhood chronic physical illness were more likely to have depression 
(Figure 2; OR = 1.31; 95% CI [1.12, 1.54]).  
---------------------------------------------- 
Figure 2 here 
----------------------------------------------- 
A significant overall association was also found for anxiety (Figure 3; OR = 1.47; 95% CI 
[1.13, 1.92]). Individual meta-analyses were performed to examine whether the type of anxiety 
affected the association with childhood chronic physical illness. A meta-analysis of the thirteen 
studies measuring general anxiety found a significant overall association (OR = 1.55; 95% CI [1.25, 
1.92]), which was similar to the meta-analyses for any anxiety. A meta-analysis of the five studies 
measuring PTSD showed a similar trend for association with childhood chronic illness (OR=1.65; 
95%CI [0.69, 3.96]), although the results did not reach the significance level. Yet, this finding 
should be interpreted with caution as the number of studies reporting PTSD is low.  
---------------------------------------------- 
Figure 3 here 
----------------------------------------------- 
For unspecified emotional problems, the association did not reach statistical significance 
(Figure 4; OR = 1.10; 95% CI [0.98, 1.24]).

Sensitivity Analyses 
Significant heterogeneity was observed across the studies of depression (Q = 84.7, df = 32, p 
< .001, I² = 65.3%); anxiety (Q = 138.2, df = 24, p < .001, I² = 86.0%), and unspecified emotional 
symptoms (Q = 41.5, df = 25, p = .020, I² = 40.7%). Meta-regression analyses showed that 
differences in mean age at the time of illness diagnosis did not explain the between-study variability 
for depression (p = .50), anxiety (p = .32), or unspecified emotional symptoms (p = .44). This was 
also the case for duration of illness (p = .10, .44, and .17, respectively); time elapsed between the 
onset of the childhood illness and adult mental health (p = .91,  64, and .89, respectively); type of 
sample (p = .29, .69, and .08, respectively); age of participants (p = .66, .56, and .38, respectively), 
and sex of participants (p = .70, .24, and .29, respectively).  
Meta-regression analyses showed that differences in type of the source information about 
childhood chronic physical illness (medical records or self-report) had a significant effect on the 
between-study variability in depression (b = -.55, SE = .28, p = .048); studies using medical reports 
had lower effect sizes than studies using self-reports of childhood chronic illness. Sensitivity 
analyses were performed to examine whether the overall association between childhood chronic 
illness and depression remained significant when only studies using medical record were included. 
The results were similar to the original meta-analysis (OR=1.25; 95%CI [1.06, 1.46]). Differences 
in the type of the source information did not explain the between-study variability for anxiety (p = 
.93), or unspecified emotional problems (p = .15). 
Meta-regression analyses including year of data collection as a moderator showed a 
significant effect on the between-study variability in anxiety (b = -.07, SE = .01, p = .027), such that 
more recent studies had significantly lower effect sizes than earlier studies. However, differences in 
  
13 
 
year of data collection did not explain the between-study variability for depression (p = .80), or 
unspecified emotional problems (p = .23). 
Furthermore, sensitivity analyses were performed to examine whether the overall 
association between childhood chronic illness and adult emotional problems remained significant 
when cancer studies were excluded from the analysis. More than half of the studies (18 out of 34) 
included in the meta-analyses were cancer studies. By excluding these within the sensitivity 
analyses, we checked whether the results were not unduly affected by these studies. The results of 
the analyses without cancer studies were similar to the initial meta-analyses for depression 
(OR=1.48; 95%CI [1.09, 2.02]), anxiety (OR=1.75; 95%CI [1.13, 2.71]), and unspecified emotional 
problems (OR=1.31; 95%CI [0.93, 1.84]). 
Finally, we have performed a sensitivity analysis for the quality of studies. Of the 37 studies 
reviewed to be included in the systematic review and meta-analysis, all achieved at least 60% on the 
STROBE checklist (with the maximum score of 82%, and the median score of 73%). Meta-
regression analyses using the median score as a threshold for low/high quality studies did not 
explain the between-study variability for depression (p = .78), anxiety (p = .07), or unspecified 
emotional problems (p = .91).

 Publication bias  
Potential publication bias was unlikely as Begg’s rank correlation tests and Egger’s 
regression tests were non-significant for all the meta-analyses (eFigure 1).

Discussion 
The present systematic review and meta-analysis focused on long-term effects of eight 
childhood chronic physical illness on emotional problems. In line with a previous non-systematic 
review (Gledhill et al., 2000), our findings suggest that adults with childhood-onset chronic 
physical illnesses are more likely to experience emotional problems than those without. Although 
the identified effects are small, the considered illnesses have relatively high population prevalence; 
therefore, they have a high public health importance.  
A possible explanation for our findings is that children with chronic physical illnesses have 
increased vulnerability for emotional problems during their childhood (Pinquart & Shen, 2011c) 
which may persist over time, and research suggests that emotional problems in childhood and 
adolescence precede and predict adulthood problems (Zahn-Waxler, Klimes-Dougan, & Slattery, 
2000). For example, the psychological distress of going through an illness or treatment, such as 
feelings of loss of control over the body (Pinquart & Shen, 2011a), and maladaptive illness 
cognitions (Verhoof, Maurice-Stam, Heymans, Evers, & Grootenhuis, 2014), may contribute to the 
development of emotional problems in adulthood. Another possible explanation is that the illness 
symptoms or treatment methods these children endure may alter the brain development that can 
have long-term effects on their mental health. For example, it is known that alterations of the HPA-
axis related to chronic physical illnesses (Purdy, 2013) may affect emotional health across the life 
course (Lupien, McEwen, Gunnar, & Heim, 2009). 
Our findings indicated that factors related to childhood chronic illness, such as age at 
diagnosis and illness duration, and participant related factors, such as age and sex, did not moderate 
the associations between childhood chronic physical illness and adult emotional problems. 
However, these findings should be treated with caution since not all the studies provided sufficient 
information for all the moderation analyses. We did reveal that the cohort effect was of importance, 
so that more recent studies, of anxiety, in particular, reported lower effects than earlier ones. This 
could be related to more effective treatments and therapies available for children with chronic 
  
15 
 
physical illness in recent years. Another explanation could be the improved precision of measures 
of anxiety in more recent studies. However, meta-analyses for the specific types of anxiety 
disorders were limited to PTSD (five studies in total), and the results of this analysis were 
inconclusive.  
With regards to specific childhood chronic physical illnesses, separate meta-analyses did not 
confirm that childhood-onset type 1 diabetes or asthma were significantly associated with emotional 
problems in later life. However, in line with previous research, our results indicated that childhood 
cancer contributed to an increased risk of adult depression. Possible explanations for the increased 
risk for depression could be that childhood cancer survivors can experience worsening physical 
health over time, as well as worsening pain and ending analgesic use. Their negative effects on 
psychological health have previously been reported in childhood cancer survivors (Brinkman et al., 
2013). Taking into account the heterogeneity of cancer, it is possible that only some types of cancer 
or some treatments of cancer have significant long-term effects on emotional problems. For 
example, brain tumours, blood cancers, or radiation treatments can affect brain function in a way 
that influences emotionality. However due to insufficient information, we were unable to analyse 
the effects of different types of cancers and treatment methods.  
Strengths and Limitations 
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically evaluate the 
associations between childhood chronic physical illness and adulthood emotional problems. The 
search that focused on eight chronic physical illnesses provided data from more than 40,000 
participants from multiple regions across the world.   
The results of the present review should be evaluated in the context of several limitations. 
First, there is a lack of studies evaluating the long-term psychological consequences of chronic 
physical illness. Indeed, most of the existing evidence is based on cross-sectional or case-control 
studies with retrospective measures, whereas population-based prospective longitudinal studies are 
still rare in this field. Only four of the studies included in our meta-analysis used prospective 
  
16 
 
longitudinal designs. Prospective longitudinal designs are preferred because they allow researchers 
to assess mental health prospectively, and to limit forgetting and recall bias.  
Given the retrospective nature of designs of most of the studies, they did not allow us to 
control for childhood mental health diagnosis and/or treatment. It is possible that the associations 
between childhood chronic illness and mental health emerge in childhood and track to adulthood. 
Indeed, the majority of mental health problems have onset in early life, with 50% of individuals 
presenting symptoms by the age of 14 years (Kessler et al., 2007). However, many individuals with 
early onset affective symptoms do not develop recurrent problems, whereas others have repeated 
affective symptoms across the life course (Musliner, Munk-Olsen, Eaton, & Zandi, 2016).   
 Second, a few studies were available for separate analyses of various types of childhood 
chronic physical illness, such that individual meta-analyses were conducted only for asthma, cancer, 
and type 1 diabetes. Further, no studies of emotional problems among individuals with chronic renal 
failure were found. One possible reason for the limited information on this disease might be the 
historical absence of a common definition and classification of the illness.  
Due to differences across illnesses and limited information provided by the studies, the 
analysis for illness severity was not conducted. The analyses conducted for other illness-related 
factors, such as the type of report of childhood illness, type of sample, and the time span between 
the onset of childhood chronic physical illness and adult mental health, did not reveal significant 
effects on the reported associations. However, not all the studies provided sufficient information; 
therefore, we might not have enough power to reveal significant effects.  
Third, even though a quality assessment for each study and additional meta-regression 
analyses to control for the possible effect of study quality on the reported overall associations were 
conducted, unknown aspects of study quality might have influenced the results.  
Fourth, the results might be constrained by the studies published in prior reports (i.e., the file 
drawer problem). Due to the time constraints, unpublished reports were excluded from analysis and 
since the studies that fail to report significant differences are less likely to be published in peer 
  
17 
 
reviewed journals, it is possible that the analysis overestimated the differences between people with 
childhood chronic physical illness and their healthy peers.  Furthermore, some published studies 
were excluded as they either did not report sufficient details for analysis, did not have control 
conditions, or used test norms as controls. However, we found no evidence of publication bias in 
this review. 
Implications and Directions for Future Research 
Our findings have important implications for clinical care. They suggest that information 
about a history of childhood chronic physical illness might be used to identify individuals who are 
at risk of developing emotional problems. It will be important to explore individual disorders for 
further such risk assessments. Interventions aimed at improving psychological well-being and 
resilience in early life for children with chronic physical illnesses could help prevent the burden 
linked to emotional problems in adulthood.  
In future, larger, well-controlled studies using samples of adults with a history of specific 
childhood chronic physical illnesses are needed. Prospective studies with control conditions are 
imperative since following children with and without chronic illnesses as they grow up may provide 
much needed causal information on the associations between emotional problems and childhood 
chronic illness. Existing studies have generally focused on young adults and the effects of chronic 
illness in older age groups remain unknown. Additional research to understand effects of various 
specific conditions (e.g., chronic renal failure, arthritis) is necessary. Finally, taking into account the 
heterogeneity in the course of affective disorders, it is important to identify mental health 
trajectories based on the age of onset and recurrence across the lifespan, as opposed to using cross-
sectional diagnoses at a single time point. This can be a critically important step in our 
understanding of how childhood chronic physical illness effect mental health across the life course. 
 
In conclusion, the present review provided evidence that childhood chronic physical illness 
is associated with an increased risk for adult emotional problems. Combined with previous findings 
on the impact of childhood chronic illnesses on mental health, the findings of the present study 
  
18 
 
highlight the need for preventative measures for long-term mental health problems associated with 
childhood chronic physical illness.
