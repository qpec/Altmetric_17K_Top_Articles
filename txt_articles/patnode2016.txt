Primary Care Interventions to Support Breastfeeding
Updated Evidence Report and Systematic Review
for the US Preventive Services Task Force
Carrie D. Patnode, PhD; Michelle L. Henninger, PhD; Caitlyn A. Senger, MPH; Leslie A. Perdue, MPH; Evelyn P. Whitlock, MD
IMPORTANCE Although 80% of infants in the United States start breastfeeding, only 22% are
exclusively breastfed up to around 6 months as recommended by a number of professional
organizations.
OBJECTIVE To systematically review the evidence on the benefits and harms of breastfeeding
interventions to support the US Preventive Services Task Force in updating its 2008
recommendation.
DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, PubMed, Cumulative Index for Nursing and Allied Health
Literature, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and PsycINFO for studies published
in the English language between January 1, 2008, and September 25, 2015. Studies included
in the previous review were re-evaluated for inclusion. Surveillance for new evidence in
targeted publications was conducted through January 26, 2016.
STUDY SELECTION Review of randomized clinical trials and before-and-after studies with
concurrent controls conducted in a developed country that evaluated a primary care–relevant
breastfeeding intervention among mothers of full- or near-term infants. Of 211 full-text
articles reviewed, 52 studies met inclusion criteria. Thirty-one studies were newly identified,
and 21 studies were carried forward from the previous review.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Independent critical appraisal of all provisionally included
studies. Data were independently abstracted by one reviewer and confirmed by another.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Child and maternal health outcomes, rates and duration of
breastfeeding, and harms related to interventions as prespecified before data collection.
RESULTS Fifty-twostudies(n = 66757)in57publicationswereincluded.Sixtrials(n = 2219)reported

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The updated evidence confirms that breastfeeding support
interventions are associated with an increase in the rates of any and exclusive breastfeeding.
There are limited well-controlled studies examining the effectiveness of system-level policies
and practices on rates of breastfeeding or child health and none for maternal health.

In 2008, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) rec-
ommended interventions during pregnancy and after birth to pro-
moteandsupportbreastfeeding(Brecommendation).17Therecom-

on the relationship between breastfeeding and infant and maternal
health outcomes1 and a 2008 review on the effectiveness of inter-
ventions to support breastfeeding.18 The purpose of the current re-
view was to update the 2008 review on interventions to support
breastfeeding to help the USPSTF update their recommendation.
Methods
Scope of Review
This review addressed 3 key questions (KQs) as shown in Figure 1.
Methodological details (including search strategies, detailed study
inclusioncriteria,excludedstudies,anddescriptionofdataanalyses)
as well as more detailed results are publicly available in the full evi-

-primary-care-interventions.
Data Sources and Searches
Forty-one studies (in 42 articles) included in the 2008 review18,20
were re-evaluated, and the following databases were searched for
new relevant English-language literature published between Janu-
ary 1, 2008, and September 25, 2015: MEDLINE, PubMED (for
publisher-supplied records only), PsycINFO, CINAHL (Cumulative
Index for Nursing and Allied Health Literature), and CENTRAL
(Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) (eMethods in the
Supplement). The database searches were supplemented by
reviewing bibliographies from other relevant literature and from
expert suggestions. ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organi-
zation International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched
for ongoing trials. Since October 2015, ongoing surveillance was
conducted through article alerts and targeted searches of high-
impact journals to identify major studies published in the interim
that may affect the conclusions or understanding of the evidence
and therefore the related USPSTF recommendation. The last sur-
veillance was conducted on January 26, 2016, and identified no
new studies.
Study Selection
Two reviewers independently reviewed all identified titles and ab-
stracts and then relevant full-text articles against prespecified inclu-
sion and exclusion criteria (eTable 1 in the Supplement). Discrepan-
cies were resolved through discussion and consensus. Fair- and
good-quality randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and before-and-after
studies with concurrent controls among mothers of full- or near-
term infants, as well as members of the mother-infant support sys-
tem (eg, partners, grandparents, or friends), were eligible. Included
studies targeted the effects of prenatal, peripartum, or postpartum
breastfeedinginterventionsinitiatedin,feasiblefor,orreferablefrom
primarycaresettings.Infanthealthoutcomesincluded,butwerenot
limited to, gastrointestinal illness, otitis media, respiratory illness,
asthma,atopicdermatitis,andinfanthealthcareutilization(asaproxy
forhealthoutcomes).Maternalhealthoutcomesincludedthosesuch
as postpartum weight loss and incidence of breast cancer. Breast-
feeding outcomes included self-reported or observed initiation
of breastfeeding, or the prevalence and duration of any or exclusive
breastfeeding. For adverse events, harms that could be related to
a breastfeeding intervention (eg, feeling criticized by the interven-
tionist,guiltrelatedtonotstartingbreastfeedingorstoppingbreast-
feeding) were included; harms related to breastfeeding itself
(eg,mastitis,nipplepain)wereexcluded.Studieswererequiredtotake

dence was applicable to a US setting.
Data Extraction and Quality Assessment
Tworeviewersindependentlyassessedthemethodologicalquality
of all eligible studies, including the original studies, using the USP-
STF study design–specific criteria (eTable 2 in the Supplement).22
Each study was assigned a final quality rating of good, fair, or poor;
disagreementsbetweentheinvestigatorswereresolvedthroughdis-
cussion.Studieswereratedaspoorqualityandexcludediftherewere
several major risks of bias (eg, evidence of selection bias or con-
founding,attritiongreaterthan40%,differentialattritionhigherthan
20%andnotaccountingformissingdata,inadequateassessorblind-
ing)thatcouldinvalidatetheresults.22Onereviewercompletedpri-
mary data abstraction, and a second reviewer checked all data for
accuracy and completeness.
Data Synthesis and Analysis
Summary tables were created for study characteristics, population
characteristics, intervention characteristics, and outcomes sepa-
rately for each KQ. The data on health outcomes (KQ1) and adverse
events (KQ3) did not allow for pooled analyses and so were summa-
rizeddescriptively.Forbreastfeedingoutcomes(KQ2),theresultsof
studies among adolescents or young adults (ie, women 21 years or
younger) and those among adults were synthesized separately. The
results for adults were organized by the level of intervention (indi-
vidual vs system) and, owing to the clinical heterogeneity between
them, were not pooled across these intervention types. Individual-
levelinterventionsincludedindividualorgroupcounselingprovided
by professionals, peer support, and structured education, whereas
system-levelinterventionsincludedhospitalstafftrainingandhospi-
talpolicies(eg,theBFHI).Becauseofthesmallnumberofstudiesavail-
ableforsystem-levelinterventions,thoseresultsarereportednarra-
tively and without pooling the data.

than 1 meta-analysis if it reported corresponding data. Within each
study, however, the data from the longest time point within a given
time category was chosen if more than 1 time point was reported
(eg, if a study reported both 12- and 20-week outcomes, the 20-
week results were pooled); with this approach, an individual trial
never contributed to more than 1 data point for a given pooled es-

significance of imbalance in study size and findings that suggested

Individual-Level Support
Among adults, individual-level support and education interven-
tions were associated with a statistically significant higher likeli-
hoodofanyandexclusivebreastfeedingforlessthan3monthsand
at 3 to less than 6 months and for exclusive (but not any) breast-
feeding at 6 months in pooled analyses (Table 1). The meta-
analysis pooling the 26 trials that reported the prevalence of any
breastfeeding for less than 3 months among adults found a statis-
tically significant pooled RR for mothers assigned to a breastfeed-
ingsupportoreducationintervention,comparedwithwomeninthe
usual care control groups (1.07 [95% CI, 1.03 to 1.11]; I2 = 72.0%;
n = 11 588) (Figure 3). The range in the absolute difference in rates
of any breastfeeding was 6.4 percentage points in favor of the con-
trolgroupto17.5percentagepointsinfavoroftheinterventiongroup.
The pooled RR for exclusive breastfeeding for less than 3 months
was also statistically significant (RR, 1.21 [95% CI, 1.11 to 1.33];
I2 = 52.4%; 22 studies [n = 8246]; range in absolute difference,
−2.5% to 22.4%) (eFigure 1 in the Supplement). Results were gen-
erallyconsistentforanybreastfeedingat3tolessthan6months(RR,
1.11 [95% CI, 1.04 to 1.18]; I2 = 46.5%; 23 studies [n = 8942]; range
in absolute difference, −5.8% to 18.4%) (Figure 4) and for exclu-
sivebreastfeedingat3tolessthan6months(RR,1.20[95%CI,1.05
to 1.38]; I2 = 44.6%; 18 studies [n = 7027]; range in absolute differ-
ence, −4.6% to 19.2%) (eFigure 2 in the Supplement).
Twenty trials among adults (n = 9715) reported the proportion
of women performing any breastfeeding at 6 months with a lack of
consistent effects across the individual trials. When pooled, the as-
sociationwasnotstatisticallysignificantbutdidnotruleoutpoten-
tial benefit (RR, 1.07 [95% CI, 0.98 to 1.16]; I2 = 57.5%; range in ab-

RRdemonstratedapositiveassociationbetweenindividual-levelsup-
portinterventionsandexclusivebreastfeedingat6months(RR,1.16
[95% CI, 1.02 to 1.32]; 17 studies[ n = 7690]), with less evidence of
statistical heterogeneity (I2 = 14.3%) (eFigure 3 in the Supple-
ment). Absolute differences in the rates of exclusive breastfeeding
at 6 months ranged from 2.9 percentage points in favor of the con-
trol group (5.2% vs 8.1% of women in the intervention and control
groups, respectively) to 21.0 percentage points (47.7% vs 26.7% of
women in the intervention and control groups, respectively). Only
3trialsreportedbreastfeedingratesat1year,andnonefoundasta-
tisticallysignificantdifferencebetweentreatmentgroups.Thefunnel
plots for exclusive breastfeeding at less than 3 months and at
6monthsrevealedasymmetricpatterns,andtheresultsofthePeters
test for small study effects was statistically significant (P = .047 for
<3 months and P = .02 for 6 months).
There was no evidence of a relationship between individual-
levelsupportandeducationinterventionsandbreastfeedinginitia-
tionafterpooling14trials(RR,1.00[95%CI,0.99to1.02];I2 = 22.8%;
n = 9428)(eFigure4intheSupplement).Despitenearlyall14trials

tiongroupmotherscomparedwithcontrolgroupmothers,noneof
theindividualtrialsfoundastatisticallysignificantbenefit.Thebreast-
feeding initiation rate was relatively high in these studies, ranging
from 53.1% to 98.7%. In addition, in all but 4 of these trials, more
than 80% of enrolled women intended to initiate breastfeeding
(range, 51.6%-100%).
There was some evidence of a differential effect of individual-
level interventions on the rates of any breastfeeding for less than 3
months (Figure 3) and 3 to less than 6 months (Figure 4), based on
the periods in which the interventions were delivered. For in-
stance,thepooledRRforinterventionsdeliveredatmorethan1pe-
riod (eg, prenatal and postpartum) showed a statistically signifi-
cantassociationwithanybreastfeedingforlessthan3months(RR,
1.14 [95% CI, 1.08 to 1.19]), whereas those delivered at 1 period only
(eg, postpartum only) did not show a statistically significant rela-
tionship (RR, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.99 to 1.06]) (test for subgroup differ-
ence, P = .001) (Figure 3). There was no evidence, however, of ef-
fect modification based on the specific type of intervention
(professional support, peer support, or education), number of ses-
sions, presence of face-to-face support, or presence of telephone
support.Theinterventionsweretoovariabletodeterminewhether
there were any differences by interventionist type or group vs in-
dividual session format.
Additionally,therewasnoevidencethattheeffectivenessofthe
interventions varied by specific population characteristics, includ-
ingbycountry(UnitedStatesvsother),breastfeedingstatusatbase-
line (whether the trial only included women who had already at-
temptedorestablishedbreastfeeding),intentiontobreastfeed,and

Only 2 trials36,43 reported adverse events related to a breast-
feeding intervention. One trial reported no significant difference in
maternal state anxiety among women receiving a postpartum
home visit vs those receiving usual care (mean difference in score,
0.3 [95% CI, −0.5 to 1.1]).43 The other trial reported that 2 mothers
expressed feelings of anxiety, decreased confidence, or concerns
aboutconfidentialityduringapeersupportinterventionandthatno
such feelings were reported by women receiving usual care.36
Discussion
This review included 52 fair- to good-quality studies that examined
theeffectivenessofbreastfeedinginterventionsonratesofbreast-
feeding. A summary of evidence for all KQs is presented in Table 2.
Only 6 studies reported results related to infant health outcomes
with mixed effects of the interventions. None of the included stud-
ies reported the intervention effect on short- or long-term mater-
nalhealthoutcomes.Individual-levelbreastfeedingsupportandedu-
cation interventions increased the relative likelihood of women
breastfeeding up to 6 months and exclusively breastfeeding up to
and at 6 months relative to those receiving usual care. The size of
the treatment effects varied in magnitude and precision in differ-
ent trials, and average treatment effects may not be applicable in
different settings. This updated review failed to find a statistically
significant relationship between individual-level breastfeeding in-
terventions and initiation of breastfeeding or any breastfeeding at
6 months.
The relatively modest effect seen within and across trials may
be a result of the breastfeeding support provided as part of stan-
dard or usual care within many of these countries and specific clini-
cal settings, and the magnitude of effect should be interpreted as
anincrementalbenefitaboveusualcare.Moststudiesindicatedthat
there was a good level of breastfeeding support within the birthing

facility at or around the time of delivery from hospital staff, includ-
ing support from lactation care providers, but failed to fully de-
scribetheminimalsupportforbreastfeedingduringtheprenataland
postpartum periods.
For system-level intervention, there was limited, mixed evi-
dence of an effect of BFHI accreditation, minimizing mother-infant
separation following delivery, or delayed pacifier use on rates of
breastfeedinginitiationorthedurationofanyandexclusivebreast-
feedingfromwell-controlledtrials.Anumberofstudies,including1
study included in this review,48 have shown that the implementa-
tionoftheindividualsteps(ormothers’perceptionofexperiencing
these steps) within the BFHI, rather than BFHI accreditation itself,
influences rates of breastfeeding.
Limitations
Several limitations of the included evidence deserve special atten-
tion. First, most of the studies included a number of threats to in-
ternal validity, including possible selection bias, reporting bias, and
relatively high attrition. Second, despite several calls over the 3 de-
cadesforstandardizingbreastfeedingdefinitionsandindicatorsfor
both surveillance and program evaluation,84,85 there was no uni-
formreportingofbreastfeedingoutcomesacrosstheincludedstud-
ies regarding definitions of breastfeeding and timing of assess-
ments.MostofthestudiesfollowedtheWorldHealthOrganization
definition for exclusive breastfeeding (which does not include wa-
ter or water-based drinks),86 but others used less robust defini-
tions or did not report what counted as exclusive breastfeeding. In
addition, there was a lack of clarity concerning the boundary point
for many of the prevalence time points. That is, it was unclear if ex-
clusive breastfeeding reported for 6 months was exclusive breast-
feeding at 6 months or exclusive breastfeeding to 6 months, which
is technically the recommendation (the introduction of something
otherthanbreastmilkatorafter6monthsamongotherwiseexclu-
sivelybreastfedinfants).Moreover,mostofthestudiesdidnotfully
describe the level of breastfeeding support given to women as part
of usual care.
Inadditiontothelimitationsoftheindividualstudies,thereare
limitations to the review methods worth noting. The review of
system-level interventions was limited to RCTs, including cluster
RCTs,andbefore-and-afterdesignswithconcurrentcontrolgroups.

(n = 338) found no difference between intervention and control groups at 1 y (22.7%
vs 25.7%).
One trial (n = 338) found no difference in risk of otitis media (43.6% vs 54.9%) or the
number of health care visits for respiratory tract illnesses (76% vs 83.4%) at 1 y.
Three of 4 trials that reported rates of infant health care utilization found higher use
among those in the usual care control groups (2.8%-36.0%) than among those who
received intervention (1.2%-25.0%).
No studies reported the effects on maternal health outcomes.
Key Question 2: What Are the Effects of Prenatal, Peripartum, and Postpartum Individual- and Health Care System–Level Interventions to Promote and Support Breastfeeding on Initiation, Duration, and Exclusivity of Breastfeeding?
Individual-level interventions
43 RCTs (n = 21 973)
Good: 14
Fair: 29
Statistical heterogeneity moderate
or substantial in most analyses and
considerable clinical variation.
Lack of detail regarding
measurement of breastfeeding,
including recall period and
definition of exclusivity.
Sparse reporting of breastfeeding
at 12 mo.
Indication of small study effects
for exclusive breastfeeding for less
than 3 mo and at 6 mo.
Consistent
Moderate
US trials (15 studies)
applicable to a
predominantly Hispanic and
black low-income
population.
Non-US trials have low
applicability, given
differences usual care and
underlying social and
cultural differences.
Statistically significant associations between individual-level breastfeeding
interventions and any breastfeeding for less than 3 mo (RR, 1.07 [95% CI, 1.03-1.11]
[26 studies; n = 11 588]) and at 3 to less than 6 mo (RR, 1.11 [95% CI, 1.04 to 1.18]
[23 studies; n = 8942]) and for exclusive breastfeeding for less than 3 mo (RR, 1.21
[95% CI, 1.11-1.33] [22 studies; n = 8246]), 3 to less than 6 mo (RR, 1.20 [95% CI,
1.05-1.38] [18 studies; n = 7027]), and at 6 mo (RR, 1.16 [95% CI, 1.02-1.32]
[17 studies; n = 7690]).
No significant association between individual-level interventions and breastfeeding
initiation (RR, 1.00 [95% CI, 0.99-1.02] [14 studies; n = 9428]).
Absolute differences in the rates of any breastfeeding ranged from 14.1 percentage
points in favor of the control group to 18.4 percentage points in favor of the
intervention group.
Interventions delivered over more than 1 time point (eg, prenatal and postpartum)
may be more effective than those delivered at only 1 time point (eg, postpartum only).
System-level interventions
9 studies (7 RCTs, 2 before-after with
matched control group) (n = 44 784)
Good: 6
Fair: 3
Only 1 cluster RCT evaluating
system-level policy change;
2 studies were controlled
before-after designs.
Limited number of studies
evaluating specific maternity care
practices related to breastfeeding.
Consistent
High applicability for studies
of policy changes
(3 studies).
Moderate applicability for
studies of maintaining
mother-baby contact
following delivery
(3 studies).
Low applicability for studies
of restricted pacifier use
(3 studies).
No consistent evidence of an association between system-level changes (BFHI
accreditation and policies for breastfeeding support groups, minimizing mother and
baby separation postdelivery, and restricting or delaying pacifier use) and the rate of
any or exclusive breastfeeding at up to 16 weeks’postpartum.
One large observational study (n = 25 327) found a statistically significant higher rate
of breastfeeding initiation and exclusive breastfeeding at 4 wk among women with a
lower education (initiation increased by 3.8 percentage points) but not among women
overall or among those with higher education (initiation increased by 0.02 percentage
points) after implementation of the BFHI.
Key Question 3: Are There Adverse Events Associated With Interventions to Promote and Support Breastfeeding?
2 RCTs (n = 844)
Good: 0
Fair: 2
Only 2 trials reported adverse
events related to the interventions.
NA
High
One trial (n = 586) reported no difference in maternal state anxiety at 2 wk
postpartum between those receiving a home visit from a nurse vs those receiving
usual care (mean difference, 0.3 [95% CI, −0.5 to 1.1]).
Another trial (n = 258) reported that 2 mothers expressed feelings of anxiety,
decreased confidence, or concerns about confidentiality during a peer support
intervention.

ThereareanumberofotherobservationalexaminationsoftheBFHI
andsystem-levelpoliciesandpractices,buttheyarelimitedtobefore-
and-after comparisons within single hospitals or retrospective de-
signs and were not included in this update. These studies, however,
generally show higher rates of breastfeeding following system-level
changes (for example, Philipp et al87 and Corriveau et al88).
Onlystudiestakingplaceincountrieslistedas“veryhigh”onthe
2014UnitedNationsHumanDevelopmentIndexwereincluded,to
ensure that the evidence was applicable to a US setting.21 This cri-
terion led to the exclusion of one of the most widely cited trials on
theeffectivenessofasystem-wideinterventiononinfanthealthout-
comes as well as breastfeeding outcomes. The Promotion of
Breastfeeding Intervention Trial (PROBIT) in Belarus (n = 17 046)
found that infants born to mothers at sites randomized to an inter-
vention modeled after the BFHI were significantly more likely than
control infants to be breastfed at 12 months and to be exclusively
breastfed at both 3 and 6 months.89 The intervention also resulted
in a significant reduction in the risk of gastrointestinal tract infec-
tionandtheincidenceofrashes,includingatopiceczema,butnosig-

Inaddition,2ofthefunnelplotspresentedasymmetry,andthe
tests for small-study effects were significant; therefore, potential
publication bias cannot be ruled out.
Conclusions
The updated evidence confirms that breastfeeding support inter-
ventions are associated with an increase in the rates of any and ex-
clusive breastfeeding. There are limited well-controlled studies ex-
amining the effectiveness of system-level policies and practices on
ratesofbreastfeedingorchildhealthandnoneformaternalhealth.
