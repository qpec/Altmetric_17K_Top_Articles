In Brief
Jones et al. show that high physiological
stress in infants, measured by cortisol
and heart rate variability, is associated
with greater cortical pain activity, but not
with increased pain behavior. Stress
disrupts the relationship between
nociceptive brain activity and behavior
and is an important extraneous factor
when predicting infant pain.

SUMMARY
Newborn
infants
display
strong
nociceptive
behavior in response to tissue damaging stimuli,
and this is accompanied by nociceptive activity
generated in subcortical and cortical areas of the
brain [1, 2]. In the absence of verbal report, these
nociceptive responses are used as measures of
pain sensation in newborn humans, as they are in
animals [3, 4]. However, many infants are raised in
a physiologically stressful environment, and little is
known about the effect of background levels of
stress upon their pain responses. In adults, acute
physiological stress causes hyperalgesia [5–7], and
increased background stress increases pain [8–10],
but these data cannot necessarily be extrapolated
to infants. Here we have simultaneously measured
nociceptive behavior, brain activity, and levels of
physiological stress in a sample of 56 newborn
human infants aged 36–42 weeks. Salivary cortisol
(hypothalamic pituitary axis), heart rate variability
(sympathetic
adrenal
medullary
system),
EEG
event-related potentials (nociceptive cortical activ-
ity), and facial expression (behavior) were acquired
in individual infants following a clinically required
heel lance. We show that infants with higher levels
of stress exhibit larger amplitude cortical nocicep-
tive responses, but this is not reflected in their
behavior. Furthermore, while nociceptive behavior
and cortical activity are normally correlated, this
relationship is disrupted in infants with high levels
of physiological stress. Brain activity evoked by
noxious stimulation is therefore enhanced by stress,
but this cannot be deduced from observation of pain
behavior. This may be important in the prevention of
adverse effects of early repetitive pain on brain
development.
RESULTS
Levels of Physiological Stress in Individual Infants
We first measured individual levels of background physiolog-
ical stress over the test period in our sample. Salivary cortisol
concentration and high-frequency heart rate variability (HF
HRV) were measured before and after the noxious test pro-
cedure. Neither salivary cortisol concentration nor HF HRV
was significantly altered by the heel lance (cortisol: pre-lance
median: 0.38 mg/dL, range: 0.03–1.74 mg/dL; post-lance me-
dian: 0.30 mg/dL, range: 0.07–1.51 mg/dL; t(27) = 1.73, p =
0.094, 95% CI [0.10, 0.17]) (HF HRV: pre-lance median:
59.98 ms2, range: 2.23–557.51 ms2; post-lance median:
90.56 ms2, range: 0.98–585.66 ms2; t(45) = 1.75, p = 0.087,
95% CI [24.47, 41.65]), and cortisol concentration and HF
HRV power after the lance were positively correlated with their
values preceding the lance (cortisol: r(28) = 0.39, p = 0.039,
95% CI [0.03, 1.07]; HF HRV power: r(46) = 0.58, p < .001,
95% CI [0.30, 0.75]). We therefore used the average of the
pre- and post-lance values as a measure of stress throughout
the test period.
Figure 1 shows the wide range of background stress in our
sample population. Salivary cortisol concentration (n = 28, me-
dian: 0.38 mg/dL, range: 0.08–1.3 mg/dL) and HF HRV power
(n = 46, median: 71.64 ms2, range: 1.61–499.16 ms2) were not
significantly correlated (r(20) = �.25, p = 0.280, 95% CI
[�0.002, 0.001]). Neither measure was affected by the sleep
state or the position of the infant (cortisol: F(3, 18) = 0.79,
p = 0.515; t(25) = 0.71, p = 0.484; HRV: F(3, 41) = 1.39,
p = 0.261; t(44) = 0.23, p = 0.822). Salivary cortisol concentration
was unaffected by the time since the last feed (F(2, 25) = 0.44,
p = 0.650). See Figures S1 and S2 for experimental design and
sample sizes.
Cortical and Behavioral Nociceptive Responses to Heel
Lance
We next measured nociceptive behavior and brain activity
in response to the time-locked heel lance in individual
infants. Behavior was measured using noxious evoked facial
grimaces scored from video recordings, and brain activity

 was measured as the amplitude of the nociceptive event-
related potential (nERP) recorded with electroencephalo-
graphy (EEG). The overall pain score (premature infant pain
profile [PIPP], a composite behavioral and physiological mea-
sure [9]) was also calculated for each baby. The physiological
(heart rate and oxygen saturation) response was included for
completeness.
The time-locked heel lance evoked a clear nERP with a char-
acteristic N3P3 waveform [11], in 33 infants (67%) (grand
average, Figure 2; single subject individual nERPs; Figure S3).
The median N3P3 peak-to-peak amplitude of the whole sample,
including non-responders, was 44.18 mV (range: 0–146.88 mV,
n = 49).
The lance also produced characteristic nociceptive facial
behavior in 23 infants (51%, median score: 3, range: 1–9) and
a physiological (heart rate and oxygen saturation) response in
40 infants (89%). The PIPP score was calculated (n = 38, me-
dian: 4.5, range: 2–17) and indicated that 24 infants exhibited
mild to no pain in response to the lance (0–6; 63%), 10 infants
moderate
pain
(7–12;
26%),
and
4
infants
severe
pain
(>12; 11%).

All the pain measures were unaffected
by the sleep state or position of the baby
(nERP: F(3, 43) = 0.97, p = 0.417;
t(46) = 0.64, p = 0.529; facial expression:
F(3, 39) = 0.50, p = 0.688; t(43) = �.12, p = 0.905; HR and O2:
F(3, 32) = 0.95, p = 0.428; t(36) = 1.63, p = 0.112; PIPP:
F(3, 31) = 0.55, p = 0.649; t(35) = 0.45, p = 0.659).
The Relationship between Infant Nociceptive Behavior
and Cortical Activity
We
next
examined
the
relationship
between
nociceptive
behavior and brain activation following the noxious heel lance
in individual infants.
Figure 3A shows a positive relationship between the amplitude
of the cortical nERP and the facial behavior, with a trend toward
significance (r = 0.28, p = 0.068, 95% CI [�0.02, 0.53])
(Figure 3A). In addition, the nERP amplitude was significantly
correlated with the PIPP score (r(36) = 0.36, p = 0.033, 95% CI
[0.30, 6.87]) (Figure 3B). There was no correlation between
nERP amplitude and the physiological score alone (r = 0.19,
p = 0.242, 95% CI [�0.13, 0.47]).
Physiological Stress Dissociates Nociceptive Behavior
from the Cortical Response
We next tested the influence of background stress upon the rela-
tionship between nociceptive behavior and brain activation. On
dividing infants into those with low (median: 0.21 mg/dL, range:
0.08–0.37
mg/dL)
and
high
(median:
0.58
mg/dL,
range:
0.39–1.3 mg/dL) cortisol levels, linear regression showed that in
those infants with a low level of cortisol concentration, there
was a significant and strong relationship between facial behavior
scores and the nERP amplitude (r(14) = 0.60, p = 0.023, 95% CI
[0.10, 0.86]). However, for those infants with a high level of
cortisol concentration, this correlation was not significant
(r(14) = 0.14, p = 0.630, 95% CI [�0.42, 0.62]) (Figure 3C).
Repeating this analysis, using the top and bottom 25% of
cortisol concentrations, produced the same pattern of results.
There was no significant correlation between nERP amplitude
and facial behavior for the highest 25% = r(7) = �.11,
p = 0.822, 95% CI [�0.80, 0.70], but there was significant corre-
lation for the lowest 25% = r(7) = 0.76, p = 0.046, 95% CI
[0.02, 0.96].
The Cortical, but Not Behavioral, Nociceptive Response
Is Related to the Stress Measures
To explore the reason for this dissociation, we looked at the rela-
tionship between stress and nociceptive behavior and cortical
activity separately. Figure 4 illustrates how together, HF HRV

 power and cortisol concentration significantly explain 27% of the
variance in nERP amplitude (multivariable linear regression:
F(2, 25) = 4.57, p = 0.020, R2 = 0.27, 95% CI [0.02, 0.52]). How-
ever, their coefficients were not significantly different from
0 (cortisol: beta = 0.32, t(27) = 1.78, p = 0.087, 95% CI [�6.91,
95.56]; HRV: beta = �.33, t(27) = 1.82, p = 0.081, 95% CI
[�.29, 0.02]), which is likely the result of collinearity between
the explanatory variables [12].
Consequently, two linear regressions for the nERP amplitude
were performed with HRV and cortisol concentration separately.
Taken individually, cortisol concentration and HF HRV power had
a positive and negative correlation with nERP amplitude, respec-
tively (cortisol: F(1, 26) = 5.36, p = 0.029, R2 = 0.17, beta = 0.42,
95% CI [6.45, 108.54]; HF HRV: F(1, 26) = 5.51, p = 0.027,
R2 = 0.18, beta = �.42, 95% CI [�.33, �.02]), with cortisol and
HRV accounting for a comparable amount of the nERP amplitude
variance (17% and 18%, respectively) (Figure S4).
In contrast, cortisol concentration and HF HRV power do not
explain a significant amount of the variance in the facial score
(F(2, 25) = 0.95, p = 0.401, R2 = 0.07, 95% CI [�0.09, 0.23]).
DISCUSSION
In this study, we have simultaneously measured stress and pain
in individual newborn infants undergoing a noxious stimulus. The

aim was to examine the relationship be-
tween behavioral and brain measures of
infant pain and how physiological stress
affects that relationship. We have shown
that the magnitude of the nERP generated
in the infant brain following a noxious heel
lance is linearly related to the magnitude
of nociceptive behavior, as measured by
the PIPP score and facial expression. However, this relationship
is disrupted in infants with high background levels of physiolog-
ical stress. The nERP measure is larger, suggesting greater
activity in the cortical networks responding to noxious input, in
the presence of higher physiological stress while pain behavior
is not affected. These data indicate the importance of under-
standing stress levels when measuring the effects of noxious
stimulation in non-verbal subjects, as behavior alone will not indi-
cate the extent of brain activation.
Brain and Behavioral Measures of Infant Pain
Behavioral measures are the cornerstone of pain measurement
in non-verbal subjects. They are extensively used in animal
models [4] and have been used to assess the efficacy of pharma-
cological and non-pharmacological pain treatments in human
infants [13–16]. Under many conditions, behavioral responses
to a noxious stimulus are a good reflection of individual pain
perception [17] and consistent with this, we have shown a linear
correlation between infant nociceptive brain activity and facial
pain behavior or PIPP, as reported elsewhere [18, 19]. However,
a reduction in pain behavior in infants is not always accompanied
by a reduction in pain-related cortical activity [20, 21], leading to
questions over the use of behavior alone to assess infant pain
[22]. Activity in the brain is not directly linked to autonomic and
somatic activity in the body and may relate more closely to
3848
Current Biology 27, 3846–3851, December 18, 2017
 pain perception. The results here support this, as the two mea-
sures differ in their ability to incorporate the level of physiological
stress, which is known to increase subjective pain experience in
adults.
Reactive and Background Stress
It is important to clarify the difference between acute, reactive
stress, and background stress in the context of this study. While
we aimed to measure background levels of physiological stress,
we noted that the noxious stimulus itself did not cause an acute,
reactive stress response. Acute, reactive stress to a defined
event or stimulus can follow from coordinated hypothalamic
pituitary axis (HPA; cortisol) and sympathetic adrenal medullary
(SAM; heart rate variability) activity [23, 24]. However, some indi-
viduals demonstrate an uncoordinated relationship between
these stress response systems, when one response compen-
sates for another [25–27]. In older infants, the autonomic nervous
system and HPA response are not always coordinated at an
individual level, in keeping with research on adults [28, 29] and
the results reported here.
Previous studies have reported a significant increase in sali-
vary cortisol following a lancet [28], but our finding that blood
sampling using a lancet did not elicit a significant acute stress
reaction is consistent with other reports [30–32]. The hospital
environment can result in high levels of physiological stress,
which mask any further increases [33], and cumulative exposure
to stressful procedures alters subsequent reactivity [34]. The
levels of background stress in our sample varied considerably
between individuals, which allowed us to study the relationship
between background stress and pain.
The Differential Effects of Stress upon Infant
Nociceptive Brain Activity and Behavior
In healthy adults, there is a significant positive correlation
between background cortisol levels and pain sensitivity [35].
Experimentally induced background stress or chronic psycho-
social stress also results in an increase in pain perception in adult
animals [5–7] and humans [8–10], but extrapolating from these
data to our infant sample is not straightforward. The effects of
stress upon pain pathways are mediated through descending
brainstem pathways to the spinal cord [5], and there is evidence
of strong descending excitatory drive from serotonergic and
other descending pathways over spinal nociceptive circuits in
infant and juvenile rats compared to adults [36–38]. This tonic
excitation may therefore increase infant pain reactivity to back-
ground stress.
However, our data suggest that increase in pain reactivity by
background stress in human infants is reflected only in brain
activity, possibly through thalamocortical pathways, and not
reflected in their motor behavior. The absence of a relationship
between background physiological levels of stress and the facial
behavioral or the PIPP score is consistent with the report that a
second lance 24 hr after the first one leads to attenuated
behavior while the cortisol response is unaffected [30]. Indeed,
there appears to be no direct correlation between behavior
and cortisol or HF HRV in infants [31, 32].
Implications of the Results
Repeated painful and stressful experiences in early life are asso-
ciated with potentially adverse changes in central nervous sys-
tem development in both animal models [39] and human infants
[40]. The data presented here show that higher levels of back-
ground stress in infants are associated with greater noxious
evoked activity in the brain, which could contribute to long-
term activity-dependent plasticity in the central nervous system.
The fact that stress-related brain activity is not accompanied by
changes in infant pain behavior means that the influence of
stress may escape the attention of caregivers. Furthermore,
soothing treatments that reduce pain-related behavioral reac-
tivity may not prevent the increase in brain activity [21, 22].
Little is known about the underlying source of neural activity
underlying the nERP [2], and it is not known whether the nERP
magnitude is related to the level of pain experienced. The
nERP magnitude cannot therefore be simply interpreted as a
measure of pain intensity. In healthy adults, the relationship
between pain report and ERP amplitude is not direct [41], but
ERP magnitudes do reflect levels of central sensitization in
pain pathways [42, 43]. Here we use nERP amplitude as a mea-
sure of the neural activity in the infant brain evoked by tissue
breaking or punctate noxious stimulation [11, 19, 44–46], but
not other salient sensory stimuli [47]. While it is possible that
the level of physiological stress (as measured by salivary cortisol
and HRV) influences the magnitude of the nERP without
Figure 4. Summary of Relationships between Pain and Stress
Measures
There is a significant linear relationship between both measures of physio-
logical stress (cortisol and HRV) and nERP amplitude (green arrows). The
significant linear relationship between the facial expression score (and PIPP
score) and nERP amplitude is only present in babies with lower levels of
cortisol (dashed green arrow). There is no relationship between cortisol and
HRV or between these stress measures and facial expression (and PIPP) (red
lines).

 influencing the actual pain experience, this does not impact
upon the importance of this study. The sensitivity of the nERP
to background levels of stress shows that noxious evoked brain
activity in individual infants is highly responsive to environmental
influences and that the extent of these influences cannot be
deduced from behavioral measures alone.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Fifty-six healthy term born infants (29 males; 36–42 weeks corrected age, mean 38 weeks + 5 days) aged between 0.5–14 days
(3.9 ± 2.4, mean ± SD) were recruited from the postnatal ward and special care baby unit at the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Obstetric
Wing, University College Hospital (UCH). Ethical approval for this study was given by the UCH ethics committee. Informed written
parental consent was obtained before each study. The study conformed to the standards set by the Declaration of Helsinki.
METHOD DETAILS
Brain activation, behavioral and physiological responses to a clinically required noxious heel lance and the background salivary
cortisol level and heart rate variability (sampled before and after the lance) were recorded (Figure S1). On some occasions, a subset
of these measures was acquired because of technical issues such as low sample volumes of saliva (Figure S2).
Noxious Stimulation
The noxious stimulus was a heel lance that was clinically required to collect a blood sample. Lances were never conducted for the
sole purpose of the study and were performed by a trained nurse using a disposable lancet. Standard hospital practice was followed
during all heel lances. Babies were soothed as and when required. Parents were informed that they could hold their baby if they
wished and babies were fed on demand throughout the study. The heel was cleaned and the lancet placed against the heel for at
least 30 s prior to the release of the blade. This was done to obtain a baseline period free from other stimulation. The foot was
squeezed 30 s after the blade was released to ensure that the cortical, cardiac, and behavioral responses were due to the
lancet alone. The release of the blade was time-locked to the ongoing EEG recording using an accelerometer mounted onto the
lancet [3]
Measures of Infant Pain
To record the cortical activity following the lance procedure, 21 EEG electrodes were placed on the scalp according to the interna-
tional 10/20 system. The PIPP was used for the behavioral/physiological composite of infant pain [48].
Electroencephalography
EEG recording: Standard electrode placement, included nineteen electrodes (disposable Ag/AgCl cup electrodes) that were placed
according to the modified international 10/20 system at F7, F3, T7, O1, F4, F8, T8, O2, C3, Cz, C4, CPz, CP3, CP4, TP9, TP10, P7, P8,
and FCz. Reference and ground electrodes were respectively placed at Fz and FC6/5. Electrode/skin contact impedances were kept
to a minimum by gently rubbing the skin with a prepping gel and applying the electrodes with a conductive paste. A soft bonnet was

 then secured over the electrodes. EEG activity, from DC to 500cHz, was recorded using the Neuroscan SynAmps2 EEG/EP recording
system. Signals were digitised with a sampling rate of 2ckHz and a resolution of 24 bit.
Data pre-processing: Traces were analyzed using EEGLAB and custom-written MATLAB scripts. Raw data were filtered with
second-order bidirectional Butterworth bandpass (1–30 Hz) and notch (48–52 Hz) filters. Data were epoched between 0.6 s prior
to and 1.1 s following the lance. Baseline correction was carried out using the prestimulus interval. Epochs contaminated with move-
ment artifact (signal exceeding ± 100cmV) were rejected.
Event-related potential (ERP) analysis: Two researchers (LJ and KW) assessed each infant’s trial independently and noted the
presence or absence of the nERP at the vertex electrode Cz. This event is characterized as a negative-positive waveform occurring
between 300–700 ms post-stimulus onset (N3P3) and is not observed following a non-noxious touch stimulus [11]. To compensate
for differences in the latency of the ERP, epochs were aligned by Woody filtering [49] between 300�700 ms post stimulus (maximum
jitter of �50 to +50 ms). Peaks were identified if distinct from the baseline and were then cross-checked with the raw EEG trace to
ensure peaks were not part of any ongoing EEG activity. This resulted in a substantial agreement between the two raters (Cohen’s
k = 0.80 (95% CI, 0.63 to 0.97), p < 0.001). Cases in which there was a disagreement were resolved in a consensus session. When the
nERP was considered present, its amplitude was measured as the difference between the positive and negative peak amplitudes
(N3 – P3). Sixteen babies (33%) did not exhibit the nERP and were given an amplitude of 0.
Premature Infant Pain Profile
Video recording and pulse oximeter: A PIPP score was calculated for each test occasion combining behavioral and physiological
measures [48]. Infant facial behavior was recorded on video [3]. Beat-by-beat blood oxygenation and heart rate were monitored
with a pulse oximeter (Nellcor Oximax) using a flexible infant probe wrapped around the lateral aspect of the unlanced foot and
held in place using a soft Velcro strap.
PIPP scoring: Three facial features were assessed during a 15 s pre-lance baseline period and 30 s post-lance (nasolabial furrow,
eye squeeze, and brow bulge). Scores were determined by the percentage of time each expression was exhibited during the 30 s
period post-lance. The overall baby’s behavioral state at baseline was also assessed, and classified as either quiet awake, active
awake, quiet sleep or active sleep.
For the physiological aspects of the PIPP measure, the pulse rate and blood saturation scores were determined by the difference
between the baseline pre-lance averages (15 s) and the min/max levels occurring within 30 s post-lance.
The maximum PIPP score, obtained by combining the behavioral and physiological scores, the behavioral state score, and a gesta-
tional age score, is 21 with 0–6 indicating minimal/no pain, 7–12 slight/moderate pain, and >12 severe pain.
Measures of Infant Stress
Heart Rate Variability
Electrocardiogram (ECG) was recorded using the same Neuroscan SynAmps2 as for the EEG. Two additional electrodes were placed
on the infant’s chest in order to record a lead I ECG throughout the study. As with EEG, the recording was time locked to the triggering
of the lancet.
HRV analysis: Heart rate variability was measured on two 30 s epochs before (pre-lance) and after (post-lance) the stimulus. Data
were bandpass filtered between 1-50Hz before automated beat detection was performed using LabChart HRV software
(ADInstruments, Spechbach, Germany). All data were visually inspected and missing beats were manually added if necessary.
RR intervals were then obtained by calculating the time between each successive beat. RR intervals were removed if confounded
by movement artifact or ectopic beats [50]. A maximum of 4 s were deleted from a trial (n = 3). High-frequency (HF, 0.15–1.1 Hz) vari-
ation of the beat-to-beat interval in the pre- and post-lance segments was computed and a power spectrum plot was generated using
the Lomb Periodogram. HF power reflects frequent beat-to-beat changes in the heart rate, which is driven by respiration (respiratory
sinus arrhythmia) when the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) has greater control. Accordingly, lower HF power indicates the
withdrawal of the PNS during the activation of the SAM system, and therefore more physiological stress [51]. HRV HF power values
were within the normal ranges as published elsewhere [52].
Salivary Cortisol
Sample collection: Salivary cortisol concentration was measured in two saliva samples collected 10 minutes before the lance and
25 minutes after [32]. An additional swab was used approximately 10 min before the start of the study in order to remove any excess
saliva and milk from the mouth. All saliva samples were collected by a research nurse using a cotton swab. The swab, which is 9cm
long, was held at one end by the nurse and gently placed into the infant’s mouth for up to 5 minutes. If infants became restless at any
point the swab was removed. The swabs were then frozen at �20�C until ready for analysis.
Cortisol analysis: Samples were assayed in duplicate when possible at a Salimetrics lab, using an enzyme immunoassay that has a
lower limit of sensitivity of 0.007mg/dL and a standard curve range from 0.012 to 3.0 mg/dL. The average intra- and inter-assay
coefficients of variation were low (4.4% and 7.6%, respectively). Cortisol concentrations measured were in line with previous
research [30, 53].
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
In order to identify any significant stress response, we compared the pre- and post-lance values for cortisol concentration and HRV
HF power using Student’s t tests. To establish the baseline stress levels throughout the lance procedure, we averaged the pre- and
Current Biology 27, 3846–3851.e1–e3, December 18, 2017
e2
 post-lance values for both cortisol concentration and HRV HF power. We then assessed the relationship between the two baseline
measures of stress (cortisol and HRV) and the measures of pain (nERP and PIPP) independently using linear correlations.
Due to the limited number of babies that had a valid cortisol measure as well as all other measures, missing cases were replaced for
further analysis that involved cortisol as a variable. First it was confirmed that data were missing at random using the MCAR test
(c2 (18) = 12.08, ns), and then missing data were replaced using the expectation maximization method [54]. For specific linear
correlations and multivariate linear regression, all babies with available cortisol data were used and missing values for the nERP,
PIPP, and HRV were subsequently replaced (5, 8, and 8 cases, respectively). For regressions that did not involve cortisol as a var-
iable, only original data were used.
To assess the effect of cortisol levels on the relationship between the nERP and PIPP score, the data were split according to the
cortisol concentrations (highest 50% and lowest 50%, 14 babies in each group). The significance of the correlation between the two
measures of pain was then tested separately in the two groups. This analysis was repeated using the top and bottom 25% of cortisol
concentrations (7 babies in each group).
We explored the relationship between the pain and stress measures with multivariate linear regression modeling using the Enter
Method. A separate regression was conducted for nERP amplitude and PIPP score with cortisol concentration and HRV HF power as
explanatory variables. All statistical analyses were conducted in SPSS (IBM Corp, Version 22). Significance was set at p < .05.
