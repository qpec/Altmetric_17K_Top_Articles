Abstract
Introduction—Although recognized as a public health problem, little attention has been paid to 
the problem of stalking among youth. Latent profile analysis was used to identify latent groups of 
adolescent stalking victims and their behavioral and mental health correlates.
Methods—A cross-sectional sample of 1,236 youths were randomly selected from 13 schools 
stratified by community risk level (i.e., low, moderate, and high risk) and gender. Students 
completed surveys assessing behavioral indicators of stalking victimization, as well as substance 
use, sexual behavior, dating violence, and psychiatric symptoms. Data were collected in 2013 and 
data analyses were performed in 2015.
Results—Analysis indicated the presence of a non-victim class, a minimal exposure class, and a 
victim class for boys and girls alike. Approximately 14% of girls and 13% of boys were in the 
stalking victim class. Adolescents in the victim class reported more symptoms of post-traumatic 
stress, mood disorder, and hopelessness, as well as more instances of alcohol use, binge drinking, 
and physical dating violence victimization. Girls in the victim class also reported engaging in 
sexting behaviors and oral sex with significantly more partners than their non-victim peers.
Conclusions—These findings provide valuable knowledge of the prevalence and pertinent 
health correlates of stalking victimization in adolescence. The data suggest a substantial 
proportion of adolescents are victims of stalking and are likewise at risk for a number of 
deleterious health outcomes. As such, this population merits further attention by prevention 
researchers and practitioners.
Introduction
Stalking is widely recognized as a public health concern with social, economic, physical, 
and psychological consequences for the victims of this phenomenon.1–4 Yet, there is a 
paucity of research on juvenile stalking that has been confined to case studies, small forensic

 samples, and anecdotal evidence.5–13 Thus, little is actually known about the rates and 
potential consequences of stalking victimization in developing adolescent populations.
Currently, no universally accepted stalking definition exists4,14,15; however, there is general 
agreement that stalking comprises a pattern of repeated behaviors under several broad 
domains, including invasion of personal space, property, or privacy; attempts to initiate 
contact; excessive or inappropriate expressions of affection; surveillance/monitoring; 
coercion/harassment; intimidation/threats; and aggression.2,4,8,14,16–22 Identifying how these 
different stalking tactics manifest in different combinations is critical because different 
stalking profiles likely confer varying degrees and forms of risk. For instance, a victim 
primarily experiencing surveillance/monitoring by a stalker may suffer far fewer physical, 
social, and psychological consequences than a victim of a stalker showing more diversity in 
stalking behavior (e.g., surveillance/monitoring, coercion/harassment, and invasion of 
privacy).22 Little research has attempted to identify typologies (i.e., latent classes or clusters) 
of stalking.20–22 Even less has considered variation in intensity/frequency of stalking 
behaviors in combination with diversity of tactics to identify stalking typologies and their 
associated consequences.20 None have attempted this undertaking with adolescents. Given 
the dearth of research with adolescent populations and the potential consequences of 
stalking, we sought to address this gap in the literature. Using latent profile analysis (LPA), 
we attempted to identify latent classes of stalking victimization, and their association to 
pertinent behavior and health correlates, based on the combined dimensions of frequency 
and constellations of stalking behaviors.
Methods
Data Sample
A random sample of 1,236 students (mean age=13.6 [SD=1.6] years; 66.7% Caucasian, 
21.4% Black/African American, 7.3% Hispanic/Latino, 6.8% Native American, 3.5% other) 
from 13 schools, stratified by sex (51.2% female, 49.8% male), grade (47.6% sixth, 52.4% 
ninth), and community risk level (31.5% low, 29.1% moderate, 39.4% high) were surveyed 
in 2013 via written questionnaire. Community risk was quantified by an index comprising 
poverty, unemployment, percentage minority, percentage rental housing, percentage female-
headed households, and community violence rates. Parents had the opportunity to refuse 
consent for their child's participation by returning a written form or by calling a toll-free 
telephone number. All students provided written assent and were informed of their right to 
withdraw from the study at any time. The IRB for Wayne State University approved all 
procedures.
Measures
Stalking victimization was measured with 19 items derived from the work of Spitzberg and 
colleagues.2,23,24 Evidence suggests adolescents are more likely to stalk casual 
acquaintances than prior dating partners,7,11 perhaps due to the limited dating history 
common to this young population. Therefore, assessment of stalking behaviors in the present 
sample was not restricted to dating partners. Instructions read: People sometimes go after 
relationships without realizing that the other person does not want one. How often has

 someone else pursued you, in order to start or continue a relationship that wasn't wanted? 
Adolescents endorsed how often they experienced the 19 behaviors in the past 12 months on 
a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (never) to 4 (ten or more times). Stalking indicators are 
provided in Table 1.
Sexual behavior was measured via three questions about the number of partners with whom 
they had engaged in (1) “sexting (sending sexual messages or pictures),” (2) “oral sex,” and 
(3) “sexual intercourse (vaginal or anal)” over the past 12 months.
Substance use was measured via four questions assessing the number of times in the past 
year they (1) “Used alcoholic beverages” (2) “Drank more than 5 alcoholic beverages on one 
occasion” (i.e., binge drink) (3) “Used marijuana (pot/grass),” and (4) “Used other illegal 
drugs (acid/speed/coke/smack)” (i.e., hard drugs). Adolescents responded on a 5-point scale 
ranging from 0 (never) to 4 (ten or more times).
Post-traumatic stress symptoms were measured with the Child Post-Traumatic Stress 
Disorder Symptom Scale.25 Respondents rated how often 17 symptoms had occurred over 
the past 2 weeks ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (five or more times per week). This scale 
has good internal and test—retest reliability as well as convergent, divergent, discriminant 
validity.25 In the current sample, Cronbach's α=0.94.
Mood disorder symptoms were measured using the K626 to assess symptoms of general 
mood dysfunction. Respondents rated on a 5-point scale how often they experienced mood-
specific symptoms (e.g., nervous or fidgety) over the previous 4 weeks ranging from 0 (none 
of the time) to 4 (all of the time). The K6 has been shown to discriminate individuals 
meeting DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for a mood disorder well from nonclinical levels of 
mood dysfunction. Psychometric properties of the K6 and ability to identify serious mental 
illness are well established.26,27 In the current sample, Cronbach's α=0.84.
Hopelessness was assessed via the Hopelessness Scale for Children28 comprising 17 items 
(e.g., I might as well give up because I can't make things better for myself Things just won't 
work out the way I want them to) with a response option of 0 (no) or 1 (yes). This measure 
correlates with severity of depression, low self-esteem, and risk for suicide.28,29 In the 
current sample, Cronbach's α=0.74.
Physical dating violence victimization was measured using the Safe Dates dating violence 
scale.30 Adolescents were asked how many times they had been a victim of physical 
behaviors by a dating partner in the past year. Fifteen behaviors were listed, including hit or 
slapped, bit, or tried to choke, beat me up, hit me with something besides a fist, assaulted me 
with a knife or a gun. Response options ranged from 0 (never) to 4 (ten or more times). In 
the current sample, Cronbach's α=0.94.
Sexual dating violence victimization was assessed via four items modified from the sexual 
coercion subscale of the Revised Conflict Tactics Scale.31 Students indicated how many 
times they had been a victim of sexual violence by a dating partner in the past year. Items 
included made me have sex without a condom, insisted on sexual activity when I did not 
want to (but did not use force), used force (like hitting, holding down, or using a weapon) to

 make me have any sexual activity, and used threats to make me have any sexual activity. 
Response options ranged from 0 (never) to 4 (ten or more times). In the current sample, 
Cronbach's α=0.87.
Statistical Analysis
Meta-analyses suggest rates and consequences of adult stalking victimization differ by sex.
32,33 Accordingly, analyses were conducted separately by sex. Analysis was performed in 
2015 using Mplus, version 7.3, controlling for clustering of data within schools. Full 
information maximum likelihood was used to handle missing data. This analysis occurred in 
two stages. First, the number of latent classes of stalking victimization using LPA were 
identified. LPA is ideal because it can identify discrete profiles of victimization based on 
which stalking behaviors co-occur in tandem with variation in frequency of behaviors. The 
primary goal of LPA is to maximize homogeneity within groups and maximize 
heterogeneity between groups. Each case entered into the LPA model receives a probability 
of membership for each class; class assignment is made based on the highest probability. 
Each class yields a probability wherein the frequency of each stalking behavior in each class 
is estimated. The number of classes is guided by theory and use of comparative fit indices 
across models with sequentially increasing numbers of classes.34–36 The Akaike Information 
Criterion (AIC), sample size adjusted Bayesian Information Criterion (aBIC), the Vuong—
Lo—Mendell—Rubin Likelihood Ratio Test (LMR), and the Bootstrapped Likelihood Ratio 
Test (BLRT) were used to determine the optimal number of classes.34–36 Average posterior 
probabilities (APPs) are also provided, which specify how well the indicators predict class 
membership. Values >0.70 suggest that the class assignment accuracy is adequate.34,35
In the second stage of analysis, the association between class membership and mean levels 
of psychiatric symptoms, substance use, number of sexual partners, and dating violence 
victimization was tested using the modified BCH method.37 Omnibus chi-squares with C—1 
df and pairwise contrasts chi-squares with 1 df are provided for each of the related 
outcomes.
Results
Class enumeration for girls indicated a large drop in fit indices (AIC and aBIC) from two to 
three classes (Table 2). The BLRT was significant and the LMR approached significance, 
suggesting a significant improvement in model fit for three versus two classes. Addition of a 
fourth and fifth class yielded a sustained significant BLRT and continued decline in fit 
indices. However, the LMR was no longer significant and decline in fit indices was 
considerably smaller than that identified from two to three classes. Visual inspection of class 
plots indicated adding a fourth or fifth class did not add substantively to interpretation and 
reflected minute differences in the frequency of behavior rather than significant differences 
in the kind of behaviors in each class. Hence, we determined the most parsimonious model 
was a three-class solution (Figure 1). The smallest class, 14% of girls, comprised youth 
endorsing a higher frequency of victimization for all indicators relative to their peers. The 
largest class, comprising 50% of girls, included non-victims reporting no stalking on all 
victimization indicators. The final class (36%) comprised girls reporting no more than

 minimal exposure on all stalking victimization indicators. This class was identified as the 
minimal exposure class because stalking by definition requires a pattern of repeated 
behaviors.2,4,14
Class enumeration for boys yielded a pattern similar to that of the girls (Table 2). There was 
a considerable drop in the fit indices from two to three classes and both the LMR and BLRT 
were significant. For four- and five-class solutions, the BLRT remained significant and the 
fit indices continued to decrease. However, the LMR was no longer significant and the 
declines in the AIC and aBIC were much smaller in proportion relative to the drop identified 
from two to three classes. Visual inspection of the class plots likewise indicated that adding 
a fourth or fifth class did not add substantively to interpretation and reflected minute 
differences in the frequency of behavior rather than significant differences the kind of 
behaviors in each class. We thus determined the most parsimonious model with substantive 
interpretation was a three-class solution (Figure 1). The three classes for boys resembled the 
three classes for girls both in size and the composition of stalking indices. The non-victim 
class comprised 53% of boys, and the minimal exposure and victim classes contained 34% 
and 13%, respectively (Table 2).
In the second stage of analysis, mean differences were tested among the classes on 
psychiatric symptoms (post-traumatic stress, mood disorder, and hopelessness symptoms), 
number of partners for disparate sexual behaviors (sexting, oral sex, and intercourse), 
substance use (alcohol, binge drinking, marijuana, and hard drugs), and dating violence 
(physical and sexual). Table 3 presents means, SEs, omnibus, and pairwise significance tests 
for boys and girls in each of the classes. A general trend across boys and girls alike emerged, 
wherein adolescents in the victim class reported more psychiatric symptoms during the past 
month and a higher frequency of physical dating violence victimization, alcohol use, and 
binge drinking during the prior 12 months. Additionally, girls in the victim class reported 
higher prevalence of marijuana use and more sexting and oral sex partners during the past 
year.
Discussion
These findings suggest three classes of youth exist, differentiated by the frequency of all 
stalking victimization indicators rather than constellations of indicators. The results were 
strikingly similar for boys and girls in terms of victim profiles, prevalences, and correlates. 
Although stalking research with older samples suggests there are sex differences in 
prevalence rates of stalking victimization, these differences tend to increase with the age of 
the sample.32,33,38
The largest identified class was the non-victim class, comprising approximately 50% of 
adolescents. The victim class was the smallest class; however, the number of youth in this 
class is not insignificant, as 14% of girls and 13% of boys were stalking victims. This class 
demonstrated heightened frequency of all 19 stalking indicators relative to their peers, again 
suggesting adolescent stalking may differ in degree rather than kind. A third class, making 
up about 35% of the sample, evinced a profile indicating, at most, minimal exposure to 
stalking behaviors. As stalking represents a pattern of repeated behaviors 2,4,8,14,16–22 and

 these students experienced behaviors, on average, one time or less, we did not consider these 
youth stalking victims. The most common behaviors experienced by this class with mean 
values slightly more than 1 were related to “hyperintimacy,” that is, expressions of affection 
or tactics to increase the intimate nature of the relationship.2 Spitzberg2 notes, “the 
difference between stalking and mere annoyingly persistent romantic pursuit is a relatively 
fine line” (p. 263). Hence, the minimal exposure class may epitomize a difficult to discern 
fine line between annoying awkward romantic pursuit and stalking.
The current findings are both similar and dissimilar to the few studies attempting to identify 
latent subgroups of stalking among adults. For example, Hirtenlehner et al.22 identified four 
classes (polytropic-intensive, polytropic-moderate, distant stalking, and surveillance only) 
distinguished by the number of stalking domains (e.g., hyperintimacy, threatening/
intimidation, aggression) experienced. However, stalking victimization behaviors were 
aggregated within domains and then artificially dichotomized. Such analysis precludes the 
ability to consider frequency of victimization behaviors in the class identification process. 
On the other hand, Björklund and colleagues20 used LPA (which allows for continuous 
indicators) to identify five classes based on latent factor scores of violence, surveillance, and 
contact seeking. In a manner similar to the present findings, four classes were distinguished 
ordinally by the degree of surveillance and contact-seeking behaviors they employed. 
Notably, one of the five classes (“wide-scope stalkers”) was differentiated from the other 
classes based on violence, whereas the other four classes evinced nearly identical levels of 
violence.
Of note, the aforementioned studies20,22 used small predominately female samples 
containing only individuals with a history of stalking victimization; the current sample was a 
large random sample that predominately comprised non-victims. Additionally, previous 
studies used stalking indicators at the domain level, whereas this study used indicators at the 
individual behavior level. It is possible that these methodological differences could 
contribute to the disparate nature of the present sample. Alternatively, it is possible that the 
relatively low level of stalking victimization behaviors in this young sample precludes the 
ability to “specialize” in type of stalking: the frequency of the stalking behaviors 
experienced in this victim class was, on average, only between two and four times. This 
limited accumulation of stalking experiences likely mitigates the variance in the diversity of 
stalking tactics. Thus, the ability to differentiate stalking classes by constellations of 
behaviors rather than just frequency may not evolve until later developmental periods in 
adolescence or adulthood.
Across biological sexes, members of the victim class endorsed more symptoms of post-
traumatic stress symptoms, hopelessness, and more frequently using alcohol, binge drinking, 
and experiencing physical dating violence victimization than their peers. Girls in the victim 
class reported sexting with and engaging in oral sex with significantly more people than girls 
in the non-victim and minimal exposure classes. In fact, across all covariates, there was a 
trend in which victims of stalking reported higher mean symptoms and risk behaviors than 
their peers in both classes.

 Limitations
These data are cross-sectional and fear or emotional distress in response to the stalking 
indicators was not assessed. Consequently, we cannot make a causal link between stalking 
victimization and the mental and behavioral health outcomes in the present research. 
Notably, most states, but not all, include fear as a necessary component in their legal 
definitions of stalking.4 In fact, some theorists distinguish between obsessive relational 
intrusion (ORI) and stalking. ORI is considered a less severe form of behavior intended to 
instigate an intimate relationship, whereas stalking is more severe, may be motivated by 
something other than a desire for intimacy, and invokes fear in the victim.39,40 Nevertheless, 
there is substantial overlap between these two constructs and even ORI has been linked to 
trauma and other unfavorable outcomes.39,41 Moreover, fear is highly subjective and 
susceptible to false positives and negatives when identifying stalking.41 Hence, the 
distinction between ORI and stalking may be more theoretic than empirical. In fact, if these 
victimization experiences are linked to adverse health outcomes, even in the absence of fear, 
then fear as consequence of stalking or ORI is irrelevant from a public health prevention 
perspective. Ultimately, longitudinal data will be necessary to clarify causal relations 
between stalking victimization and associated socio-emotional health in adolescence.
In addition, the duration of stalking victimization was not assessed. This additional 
dimension likely affects the severity of consequences associated with such experiences and 
may function differently than the frequency of victimization.33 Among adults, the average 
duration of victimization is nearly 2 years, giving rise to the potential that consequence 
severity may result from the cumulative impact of a pattern of behaviors over time rather 
than the threat conferred by any particular event.20,33 For adolescents, who change objects of 
affection frequently,42 the duration of stalking victimization is likely short.33 However, it is 
possible even short periods of stalking may have significant consequences for youth during 
this formative stage when coping and emotion regulations skills are not fully matured. 
Notably, one study found that “serious violence” was actually associated with shorter 
stalking durations.43 Thus, it will be important for future research with longitudinal designs 
to include duration of victimization. The extent to which stalking's impact is more a function 
of behavioral diversity, frequency, and/or duration likely has implications for prevention, 
therapeutic, and statutory purposes.
Conclusions
The present investigation provides a novel approach to measuring stalking victimization that 
may obviate the need to address fear as a criterion. The findings indicate victims of youth 
stalking are prevalent and at particularly high risk for a number of adverse behavioral and 
mental health outcomes. As such, stalking among adolescents represents a significant public 
health problem that necessitates the establishment of appropriate surveillance methods and 
attention by prevention experts.
