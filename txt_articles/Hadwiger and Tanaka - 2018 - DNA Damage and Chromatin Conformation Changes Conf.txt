Over the last decades, medical research has utilized DNA altering procedures in
cancer treatments with the objective of killing cells or suppressing cell proliferation.
Simultaneous research related to enhancing disease resistance in plants reported that
alterations in DNA can enhance defense responses. These two opposite perspectives
have in common their effects on the center for gene transcription, the nuclear chromatin.
A review of selected research from both anticancer- and plant defense-related research
provides examples of some specific DNA altering actions: DNA helical distortion,
DNA intercalation, DNA base substitution, DNA single cleavage by DNases, DNA
alkylation/methylation, and DNA binding/exclusion. The actions of the pertinent agents
are compared, and their proposed modes of action are described in this study. Many of
the DNA specific agents affecting resistance responses in plants, e.g., the model system
using pea endocarp tissue, are indeed anticancer agents. The tumor cell death or
growth suppression in cancer cells following high level treatments may be accompanied
with chromatin distortions. Likewise, in plants, DNA-specific agents activate enhanced
expression of many genes including defense genes, probably due to the chromatin
alterations resulting from the agents. Here, we propose a hypothesis that DNA damage
and chromatin structural changes are central mechanisms in initiating defense gene
transcription during the nonhost resistance response in plants.

INTRODUCTION
Features of DNA-specific agents and their actions on cancer cells may share modes of action
related to those inducing disease resistance in plants. The objective of cancer treatments is mainly
to selectively stop cancer growth with little collateral damage to healthy cells. Some of the same
DNA-specific compounds (Hendry et al., 2007) have been shown to activate defense response
genes, termed pathogenesis-related (PR) genes (Hartney et al., 2007; Hadwiger, 2009). Research on
the plant side is aimed at stopping fungal growth. The characterization of DNA damage-induced
protein synthesis in plants is variable and involves traits ranging from DNA damage-related repair

Anti-cancer Agents and Plant Immunity
proteins to defensins (peptides) that are directly toxic to fungal
pathogens (Chiang and Hadwiger, 1991; Almeida et al., 2006).
HYPOTHESIS DEFINED
Pathogenesis-related genes are major contributors to the plant’
s
nonhost resistance to pathogens (Hadwiger, 2015a). In addition,
the DNA-specific signals for activation of these genes can be
initiated by “
elicitors”or “
effectors”of pathogen origin (Jones
and Dangl, 2006; Boller and Felix, 2009). The transcription
of these defense genes is ultimately coded by the DNA
within the chromatin of the nucleus. Based primarily on the
accumulated data on defense gene activation in pea endocarp
tissue we are hypothesizing that multiple DNA-specific agents can
activate PR genes and stimulate secondary metabolic pathways
(e.g., producing antifungal compounds called phytoalexins) by
generating direct effects on chromatin conformation. In a
manner similar to how effectors can initiate signals (via cascading
routes) to engage the transcription factors and positively affect
stalled genes, the DNA/chromatin-specific agents can increase
transcription via direct conformational changes (Hadwiger, 2008).
This paper assembles mechanistic information from current
and previously published literature on transcription initiation
(Hager et al., 2009). Because of the complexity of chromatin,
the understanding of its ability to determine how and when
the appropriate genes within are suppressed or expressed, is
a challenge for all eukaryotic research. The RNA polymerase
complex that transcribes the DNA code is confronted by
a tightly packed genomic DNA in a nucleosome structure.
Thus, gene transcription requires that a single DNA strand
transit the DNA polymerase II enzyme in an environment of
tight DNA helixes and attached nuclear proteins (Ma et al.,
2013). Transcription benefits from removal of DNA helices
and temporarily dissociating DNA from histones and other
nuclear proteins (Yaniv, 2014). The genes coding PR and
other defense gene products are apparently silent, stalled or
partially suppressed prior to contact with a fungal pathogen.
The suppressed environment of sensitive DNA regions (Teves
and Henikoff, 2014) can be changed by: DNA intercalators,
DNA base substitution, thymidine dimerization, DNA minor
groove insertion, histone modification or removal, DNA strand
cleavage and other chromatin-specific effects–to a transcription
positive state. Within these agent actions are the eliciting agents,
chitosan oligomers (Kendra et al., 1989) and a single strand
cleaving DNase known to be released by pathogens (Hadwiger
and Polashock, 2013) and transferred to the host nucleus in the
pea nonhost resistance response.
Our
hypothesis
is
that
these
general
conformational
changes occur within sensitive regions present in multiple
chromosomes since the genomic mapping of the pea genome
locates
PR
genes
in
multiple
chromosomes
(Pilet-Nayel
et al., 2002; Ramirez-Prado et al., 2018). We also realize
that DNA/chromatin changes can also stimulate some genes
not directly involved in disease resistance. The following
paragraphs detail the data upon which the hypothesis was
derived.
DNA DAMAGE: INSIGHTS INTO THE DNA
TARGETS OF ANTICANCER AGENTS
AND PHYTOALEXIN ELICITORS
Specific DNA altering actions including DNA intercalation, DNA
distortion, DNA base substitution, DNA single and double
strand cleavage, alkylation and methylation, DNA binding and
exclusion in cancer related research (Martinez and Cha�con-
Garcia, 2005) compare with the action of many of the same
agents affecting resistance responses investigated primarily in
the model endocarp tissue system of pea plants (Pisum sativum)
(Hadwiger, 2015a). Early research on disease resistance in pea
tissue revealed alterations in nuclear DNA that enhance defense
responses (Hadwiger and Schwochau, 1971). These two opposite
perspectives have in common their effects on the center for gene
transcription, nuclear chromatin (Nair and Kumar, 2012). The
similarities of action at the chromatin level in both systems are
based on the degree of interaction.
The chromatin/DNA perspective presented herein by-passes
a different interpretation of the signaling events that involve
the plant receptor-like kinases as initiators of disease resistance
or plant defense that is reviewed elsewhere (Nürnberger et al.,
2004; Boller and Felix, 2009; Antolin-Llovera et al., 2014).
Briefly, such signaling between an elicitor PAMPs (pathogen-
associated molecular patterns) via receptor-mediated transfer
to specific defense response genes within chromatin or intact
pea tissue has been observed but primarily with high levels of
two PAMPs (Hadwiger and Chang, 2015). These high PAMP
concentrations were also associated with DNA damage and
thus have commonality with the DNA-specific agents discussed
herein.
Cell death or suppression in cancer following high-intensity
treatments may be accompanied by chromatin distortions
capable of activating the expression of less-desirable collateral
genes. Likewise, in the pea endocarp, high-level treatments
of DNA-specific agents can cause cell death, while low-level
chromatin alterations activate the defense genes associated with
immunity, i.e., nonhost resistance (Hadwiger et al., 1974; Choi
et al., 2001; Hartney et al., 2007; Isaac et al., 2009). Some of
the anticancer drugs remaining in use today are DNA damaging
agents, and those that have been used to the best advantage in
the past are being re-visited (Gurova, 2009). These agents have
the potential to target the DNA of tumor cells, resulting in their
destruction. However, their clinical use can result in adverse side
effects, and since some are also carcinogenic, their continued use
can promote secondary cancers.

generated by infectious and inflammatory diseases. Thus, DNA
damage is involved in innate and adaptive immunity (Fontes
et al., 2014). At the transcriptional level there is the regulation
of cytokines and other genes involved in the inflammatory
response. Chemical modifications to DNA and the histone
components of chromatin potentiate gene expression. As an
example, chromatin must become accessible to allow activation-
induced cytidine deaminase (AID)-mediated deamination of
cytosines in DNA (Daniel and Nussenzweig, 2013). In response
to DNA damage there is a removal of DNA lesions. In the
arousal of the immune system there can be an expression of
antimicrobial peptides and development of ligands for receptors
found on immune cells. Components that can arouse include
DNA damage sensors, transducer kinases, and effectors (Nakad
and Schumacher, 2016). Some progress has been reported in
distinguishing which molecular and cellular pathways of the
DNA damage activate immune signaling (Kastan and Bartek,
2001).
INDUCTION OF PEA DEFENSE
RESPONSES
Investigations into the induction of plant defense responses by
DNA-specific compounds in peas have occurred in parallel over
multiple decades (Figure 1). Messenger RNA from pea tissue
treated with DNA-specific agents was subsequently translated
in vitro. This technique identified the total array of newly
expressed gene products as characteristic protein patterns in 2-D
electrophoretic separations. These patterns enhanced by the DNA
specific anti-cancer actinomycin D in the plant host were similar
to those induced following inoculation with fungal pathogens
(Loschke et al., 1983). Both treatments also promoted the
production of the anti-fungal phytoalexin, pisatin (Schwochau
and Hadwiger, 1968; Hartney et al., 2007; Hadwiger and Tanaka,
2017a).
Specific concentrations of actinomycin provided resistance
against Fusarium solani f. sp. pisi (Fspi) a true pathogen in pea
(Figure 2). The variation of resistance that is concentration-
related, probably due to the progression of DNA changes as
more actinomycin molecules become involved. Actinomycin D
1 µg/ml applied 1 h prior to the pathogen spores (Figure 2B)
there gave no cytologically detectible induction of resistance
allowing the pathogen to proceed as it did following the water
treatment (Figure 2A) in the absence of the hypersensitive host
response. At 3 µg/ml (Figure 2C) the presence of actinomycin
induces a resistance that is a plant disease resistance response
rather than a direct antifungal action.
Follow-up research utilized the chemical properties of other
DNA-specific agents to investigate the basis of defense gene
induction in plants, which may relate to DNA conformations or
chromatin alterations.
The actions of compounds such as actinomycin D that
specifically target DNA base sequences were valued for use
because of the available background of physical and chemical
information. The DNA intercalating property was first thought
to primarily inhibit RNA synthesis; however, there were
reports that it super-induced certain genes in other eukaryotes

FIGURE 2 | Effect of different concentrations of actinomycin D applied 1 h
prior to inoculation on the susceptibility of pea endocarp tissue to the true

endocarp tissue against a pea pathogen (Fspi) are sharply influenced by
different concentrations of actinomycin D applied 1 h prior to inoculation.

(Steinberg et al., 1975). Actinomycin D was also found to increase
mRNA for specific pea genes. Examination of chromatin
spreads from pea cells injected with labeled uridine indicated
that regions of the chromatin are unraveled by actinomycin
D, and unraveled chromatin supports hot spots of RNA
synthesis (Hadwiger, 2015a). The action of actinomycin D
demonstrates the complexity of DNA damage-related changes.
The defense response induction by DNA-specific agents in
plants was obtained with low actinomycin concentration levels.
Actinomycin D was widely utilized in biological research for its
ability to complex intimately (Reich and Goldberg, 1964) with
DNA by intercalating the planer ring structure between base pairs
and subsequently suppressing mRNA production (Flamm et al.,
1966). It was noted that the binding of actinomycin D to the
DNA in chromatin was restricted by the chromosomal proteins,
and thus the binding of actinomycin D to chromatin could be a

electron microscope, showing the intimate association of the pea nucleus with

Adams, 1978).
measure of the amount of DNA not masked by the chromosomal
proteins (Beato et al., 1970). Alternately, this measure was used
in plant systems to determine how much externally applied
actinomycin D was transferred to the nucleus and to evaluate the
open regions of DNA in pea cells; and the increased template
activity that developed following treatment with elicitors and
fungal challenges (Hadwiger et al., 1974).
These results demonstrated that both anticancer agents and
defense gene activators can influence the structure and function
of chromatin. Why is actinomycin D not inhibiting RNA
synthesis in pea? In bacterial cells, actinomycin D is able
to intercalate DNA at a rate of 1 molecule per 1000 base
pairs and successfully suppress mRNA production (Hyman
and Davidson, 1970). Alternately, the optimal induction of
pea defense responses occurs when less than 1 molecule of
actinomycin D inserts per 10,000 DNA base pairs (Hadwiger
et al., 1974), a level that does not significantly suppress RNA
synthesis. Thus, there is an apparent difference in action between
plants and other systems based on the degree of intercalation.
The activation of defense genes in pea tissue is proposed to occur
by direct action on chromatin structure (Isaac et al., 2009) and
is often accompanied by DNA damage. This disruption can be
observed by electron microscopy (Hadwiger and Adams, 1978).
The regions of disrupted chromatin structure have been shown
to be regions of intense labeling with RNA precursors (Hadwiger,
2015a). The chromatin alteration hypothesis has been further
tested in pea endocarp tissue and is compared with a series of
compounds with well-researched modes of action (Hartney et al.,
2007). Chromosome dynamics can also be influenced by inherent
cytoskeleton polymers such as actin filaments, microtubules and
intermediate filaments that connect to the nuclear envelope
(Figure 3) (Spichal and Gabre, 2017). The smaller of these
molecules can enter the nucleus and act as chromatin remodelers.
In pea, an assay for detecting agents initiating the transcription
of defense responses monitors a secondary pathway that
culminates in part with the production of the anti-fungal
isoflavonoid, pisatin. Compounds that are elicitor-positive in

this assay were further examined to determine whether similar
changes occur in the elicitation of total disease resistance in
pea by a bean pathogen (nonhost resistance) or in furthering
susceptibility to both pea and bean-specific pathogens (Hartney
et al., 2007). Additional assays of pea tissue involved cell
fractionation and cytological preparations that specifically
examined DNA damage (Isaac et al., 2009), nuclear protein
modification (Klosterman et al., 2003), and nuclear diameters
changes (Tanaka and Hadwiger, 2017). As indicated, the
accumulation of phytoalexin, pisatin, and PR gene activation are
responses that are associated with the defense response of pea.
VARIATION IN DNA-SPECIFIC AGENTS
ACTION
The modes of action of selected compounds on DNA in vitro
are defined in Table 1 and their relative effects on the
accumulations of the phytoalexin, pisatin are presented in
Table 2. A large number of cyclic molecules have the potential
to intercalate between the base pairs of DNA. Many derivatives
of acridine have been shown to positively induce pisatin
production (Hadwiger, 1972a). This action is shared by the
compounds with planar three ring structures (e.g., in ethidium
bromide). A positively charged nitrogen in the azole ring or
on the side chain presumably attracts the negatively charged
phosphate groups of DNA (Schwochau and Hadwiger, 1968).
Unfortunately, many medically important compounds, including
antihistamines, antimalarials, decongestants, chelators, etc., are
also capable of intercalating DNA (Hadwiger, 1972a). Not all
DNA intercalators are cytotoxic. Some small molecule drugs have
now been shown to have a wide range of biological activities:
i.e., vitamins, hormones, hormone antagonists, antipsychotics,
antidepressants, and antihistamines. The DNA helix is flexible
and can be readily wound or unwound. When unwound cavities
appear between the base pairs, the space approximates that of
small molecule natural products. For example, the shape of
the steroid hormone estradiol is a good fit between base pairs
of unwound DNA (Hendry et al., 2007). The plant hormone
gibberellic acid fits into the intercalation site 5�-dTdG-3� 5�-
dTdA-3� (Witham et al., 1978). Other natural products, such
as caffeine, vitamin D and riboflavin, fit into unwound DNA
(Hendry et al., 1977). The specific sequences in DNA into
which ligands best intercalated were found in the consensus
sequences of genes activated by nuclear receptors, indicating that
intercalation was central to their mode of action.
The intercalator modes of action are also likely to occur
by altering the DNA torsions (unwinding) that can affect the
transcription of some genes (Ma et al., 2013). The mechanics
by which transcription is affected by DNA intercalators have
been investigated. Although there are multiple interpretations,
the following actions and conditions are well understood (Pruss
and Drlica, 1989):
The packaging of DNA into the cell is assisted by histones
and supercoiling, often causing negative supercoiling of the DNA.
The supercoiling of the DNA in advance of the polymerase
transcription complex must be removed, and the polymerase

the region in front of the polymerase is unwound, there is
compensatory positive supercoiling well ahead of the complex
(Gilbert and Allan, 2014). Alternately, the DNA behind the
complex is rewound with the development of compensating
negative supercoils. DNA intercalators can twist DNA, thus
affecting the supercoiling independent of the aid from a protein.

cause the dissociation of DNA at the edge of the nucleosome,
followed by re-association of the DNA inside the nucleosome
(Tang et al., 2010). Such complexes can function as tumor
suppressors.
As indicated earlier, extensive research on the DNA-specific
intercalator actinomycin D indicates the diversity of action
in vivo. Actinomycin D was found to be a super inducer of
the synthesis of some animal genes (Chatterjee et al., 1979).
In an early screening of intercalators, we found actinomycin D
and other intercalators to be strong activators of plant defense
responses (Schwochau and Hadwiger, 1968). Actinomycin D
action in pea tissue, in contrast to mRNA inhibition, has
been explained in various ways, such as suppression of the
production of transcription factors or suppression of RNase
activity. However, as a general conclusion of the action of DNA
intercalators in pea tissue, we propose that the torsional effect
on the DNA helix is a major factor in promoting transcription,
as indicated in cancer research (Teves and Henikoff, 2014).
Additionally, because of the many similarities of plant and
animal chromatin structure and the effect of such DNA-specific
compounds on plant chromatin, concentrations below the lethal
action are likely acting on varying levels of transcription
enhancement and thus on the differential activation of genes.
SUBSTITUTION OF DNA BASES AND
HELIXES
Externally applied base analogs, such as 5-bromo deoxyuridine
and 5-iododeoxyuridine, can activate the pisatin pathway in
pea (Sander and Hadwiger, 1979). The base analog must be
incorporated into pea DNA before any induction occurs. The
nuclei undergo condensation just prior to the detection of the
induced increase in phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) activity.
The mode of action involved the insertion of a base analog into
the DNA, and the transcriptional increase was likely due to a
change in the DNA helical structure during the removal of the
aberrant abduct.
DNA CROSS-LINKING AGENTS
The alteration of the DNA helix that developed from a cross-
linked psoralen activates phytoalexin (pisatin) production in
pea endocarp tissue and is likely triggered during the DNA
repair process that would remove this aberration (Parsons and
Hadwiger, 1998). In humans, such cross-linking may be general
along the genome as the associated symptoms are extensive.
The effect of cross-linking DNA by psoralen compounds was
first reported as an environmental hazard on celery harvesters.
Psoralen compounds develop when celery plants are infected by
the fungal pathogen Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Floss et al., 1969).
The hazardous effect on workers occurred when the psoralen
entered the skin of their hands. The additional environmental
action came from the UV content of sunlight that enables the
compound to cross-link DNA strands. The psoralen is activated
to form covalent bonds. The subsequent human symptom was
tumorous growth on the workers’
hands. Psoralen compounds
have also been shown to activate multiple plant defense responses
in pea endocarp tissue (Parsons and Hadwiger, 1998). Prior
to the development of other molecular assays, the psoralen
cross-linkage was also utilized to locate DNA segments within
open reading frames of the PR genes, which provided evidence
that the DNA abduct had occurred in the vicinity of the
defense gene. This site-specific adduct was detected on southern
blotting analyses run on alkaline gels (the cross-link of DNA
slowed the electrophoretic of cross-linked segments and not the
migration of alkali separated DNA segments). The precise effect
of crosslinking in activating the pea defense response is not
known; however, the removal of this adduct, such as the removal
of other adducts, renders the DNA free to unwind or modify as
the repair is undertaken.
The DNA within chromatin can be negatively or positively
helically coiled; thus, the presence of these supercoils can be
obstructive to the progression of the RNA polymerase complex.
The progression of this complex along the DNA molecule during
transcription requires an absence of obstruction, as well as a
separation of the strands, as shown in the drawing (Figure 5). The
loosening of the nucleosome structure by a single strand cleaving
DNase can occur both by freeing a single strand and exposing
DNA for enzyme access and by allowing a release of the negative
helix of the supercoiled DNA.
BIOTIC DNA TARGETING AGENTS
Fungus-related DNase function, in support of the growing fungal
mycelium, was thought to occur as a means to break down DNA
as a nutritional source of nucleic acid bases. A fungal DNase
capable of cleaving single DNA strands is synthesized in most
fungi (Hadwiger and Polashock, 2013) with an N-terminal signal
peptide that enables it to cross membranes (Klosterman et al.,
2001). However, as an inadvertent occurrence, the immediate
plant defense response slows fungal growth. The resultant DNase
accumulation that normally occurs in old mycelia for the purpose
of digesting and recovering DNA components for reuse now
occurs in the hyphal tip. It appears to accumulate close to the
growing tip and effectively cleaves the single strands of the
DNA that must remain intact for cell division. In the absence
of a functional nucleus, fungal growth is terminated (Hadwiger,
2015c). All of the genomes of fungi sequenced thus far contain the

DNA coding sequence for this mitochondrial DNase (Hadwiger
and Polashock, 2013). The universality of the DNA strand
cleaving function in eliciting a defense response is likely a major
contribution to the development of “
nonhost resistance”that
protects plants from all but their true pathogens. The growth of
a true pathogen is not so severely suppressed by the pea plant
defense response, and mycelial tips can retain some viable nuclei.
Mycelia with viable nuclei can continue growth on the plant
tissue (Hadwiger, 2015c), as the major defense response subsides.
Naturally
occurring
proteins/peptides
and
synthesized
polymers rich in the basic amino acids arginine (A) and lysine
(K) were found to be capable of producing pisatin in peas.
Protamine, histones, spermidine, spermine and some basic
enzyme protein domains present in RNase and snake venom
elicit pisatin production. All are rich in basic amino acids or
basic charges (Hadwiger and Schwochau, 1970). The synthetic
peptides poly-L-lysine and poly-L-arginine are elicitors but
are unlikely to be natural pisatin elicitors. However, these
basic peptides provide clues regarding the potential of natural
protein segments rich in arginine or lysine to act in this capacity
(Brunner et al., 2002). These synthetic proteins (peptides) can
be mimicked by carbohydrates that are also strongly positively
charged. Chitosan is a basic polymer of glucosamine and is a
signaling component in the pea/Fusarium interaction (Hadwiger
et al., 1981; Hadwiger, 2015b). Chitosan shares the DNA affinity
property of basic peptides and can activate the same responses
in pea endocarp tissue as the bean pathogen, F. solani f. sp.
phaseoli (Fsph) (Loschke et al., 1983). Furthermore, a large
group of microbes contain chitin (polymers of β-linked N-acetyl
glucosamine) and chitosan (polymers of β linked glucosamine).
Chitosan heptamers of seven sugars or more represent optimal-
sized elicitors (Kendra et al., 1989). Although chitin structure
has similarities to chitosan, the added acetyl group negates the
positive charge of the amino groups, rendering it less effective as
an elicitor unless there is a chitin receptor to carry forth the signal
(Hadwiger and Chang, 2015). A computer analysis indicates that
the chitosan heptamer (seven glucosamine residues) fits into the
minor groove of the DNA molecule (Hadwiger et al., 1989).
OTHER MINOR GROOVE TARGETING
AGENTS
The minor groove of DNA is a target of anticancer drugs
(Figure 6). These include distamycin A and mithramycin
(Figure 7), and Hoechst 33258 (pibenzimol), 4�,6-diamidino-2-
phenylindole (DAPI) and neptropsin, which are topoisomerase
poisons or helicase inhibitors, preferring an AT-tract duplex DNA
(Varqiu et al., 2008). Chitosan has had only limited evaluations
as an anticancer agent; however, chitosan, actinomycin D, and
camptothecin all activate the production of p53, a tumor-
suppressing protein, in the mouse pre-neoplastic mammary cell
line CL-S1 (Hadwiger et al., 1997). All three agents activate
defense genes in pea (Isaac et al., 2009), and although each
agent is capable of altering chromatin structure within the
nucleosome (Figure 8), they reportedly have differing specific
modes of action. The concentration of positive charges on
chitosan may compete with pea histones that function to compact
the cellular DNA in the nucleus (Hadwiger, 2008; Isaac et al.,
2009). Chitosan’
s action on chromatin is able to loosen the
compaction of the nucleosome structure, allowing stalled genes
to resume transcription (Hadwiger, 2015a). Messenger RNA from
chitosan-treated pea tissue when transcribed in an in vitro protein
synthesis system also produces protein 2-D patterns closely related
to mRNA from pea tissue that responds to a bean pathogen,
Fusarium solani f. sp. phaseoli (Fsph) (Loschke et al., 1983).

FIGURE 6 | Schematic representation of four major actions on the helical
condition of DNA. Mithramycin as a minor groove targeting agent displaces
the Sp2 transcription factor (Neigeborn and Carlson, 1984; Miskovic et al.,
2013). Chitosan resides in the DNA minor groove (Hadwiger et al., 1989).
Ethidium bromide intercalates between DNA base pairs (Lenglet and
David-Cordonnier, 2010). Spermine can both enter the minor groove and the
major groove in a manner that enables the bridging of both (Bryson and
Greenall, 2000).
recognition (Bewley et al., 1998; Klosterman and Hadwiger,
2002). Both bind in the minor groove of DNA and make
conformational changes in the DNA. Both occur widely in
eukaryotic organisms, including plants. Some chemicals that
binds the minor groove of DNA such the bis-benzimidazoles
(Hoechst 33258) and DAPI have been used for cancer therapy
(Baraldi et al., 2004). These compounds interact physically
with DNA and cause reversible inhibition of DNA-dependent
functions. Hoechst 33258 (but not DAPI) was found to be an
elicitor (weak) of phytoalexin production in pea tissue. These
two compounds, along with chitosan, reportedly enter the
DNA minor groove (Baraldi et al., 2004). The strong induction
by the chitosan preparation (Table 1) with heptamer-sized
polymers may benefit from molecular lengths large enough to
outperform the smaller spermine and Hoechst 33258 compounds
in initiating the pisatin induction, using this single parameter
for comparison. Given information on the mechanism of
action of DNA-specific abiotic compounds in altering the
DNA within chromatin and activating a defense response, the
information should be useful to understand the mechanism
of the biotic DNA-specific action of chitosan that also occurs
in the minor groove of DNA. Similarly, a comparison of the
multiple compounds utilized in cancer therapy would be useful
in determining which groove-binding abiotic compound was
most active or inactive in inducing collateral gene activation
responses. The pisatin assay was utilized to evaluate the optimal
accumulations that could be generated by the compounds listed
in Table 2.
In calf thymus tissue, the non-histone proteins HMG 1 and
HMG 2 are capable of unwinding the DNA double helix. Pea
tissue also possesses a HMG A protein (Klosterman et al., 2003)
that is reduced in the chromatin material during the initiation of
the pea defense response (Isaac et al., 2009). HMG A is considered
an architectural transcription factor with a wide array of actions
in both stabilizing and altering chromatin structure. Its action is
reportedly influenced by the associated salt solution of the assay
(Javaherian and Sadeghi, 1979).
There is an alteration of nuclear structure that occurs in the
early minutes of pea/Fusarium solani formae species interactions.
Interactions at 5 h were globally more intense in the compatible
interaction than in the resistance reaction (Isaac et al., 2009).
Western analyses, mass spectrometry, and [32P] techniques
were used to follow the disappearance of the architectural
transcription factor HMG A and histones H2A/H2B. Of more
specific interest, at 5 h, these nuclear proteins were also observed
to be less abundantly complexed in the vicinity of two PR
genes, DRR206 and the β-glucanase gene, utilizing chromatin
immunoprecipitation analyses. There is an early ubiquitination
of HMG A and some histones (Isaac et al., 2009). This suggests
that the DNA breaks and the removal of nuclear proteins may
assist the progression of stalled genes that had previously been
obstructed. Some of the specific defense genes become activated
as nuclear proteins (histone/HMG A) are removed.
DNA DAMAGE AND REPAIR ASPECTS
FROM CANCER THERAPEUTIC
RESEARCH
DNA damage is an early event the pea endocarp/fungal pathogen
interaction (Tanaka and Hadwiger, 2017) and occurs following
other DNA inducing treatments. DNA damage is also a linking
mechanism in animal immunity development (Brzostek-Racine
et al., 2011; Nakad and Schumacher, 2016). The DNA damage
activates immune signaling through molecular and cellular
pathways and drives chronic inflammation in humans. The DNA
damage response can also induce interferon production.
Some of the chemotherapy-induced DNA damage responses
include genes for DNA repair (Woods and Turchi, 2013).
Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinases are activated and
phosphorylate many substrates, including proteins involved
in checkpoint activation, DNA replication and DNA damage
repair. It remains uncertain whether ATM binds directly to
DNA. As indicated above, the transcription complex movement
is facilitated in the absence of helical blocks and histone
attachments to the DNA. Additional effects on the helical
structure are possible by non-histone proteins such as HMG
A (Isaac et al., 2009), which can unwind the double helix,
and by nucleases such as ribonuclease and gyrases, which can
cause destabilizing effects on DNA helical structure (Felsenfeld
et al., 1963). The development of anticancer drugs needs to
take these direct actions on DNA into consideration. Alternately,
the defense response of pea tissue is strongly affected by
these additional proteins. Ribonuclease A strongly induces the
accumulation of the pea phytoalexin pisatin. This activity is
diminished by half if the ribonuclease is autoclaved prior to
application, and reportedly, ribonuclease S loses half of its
pisatin-inducing potential if only the non-enzymatic portion
of the “
S” molecule is applied, indicating that the action is
a combination of enzyme activity and non-enzymatic cationic
proteins. Additionally, the digestion of the RNA content may
have a functional role in chromatin structural change. A number
of other basic proteins also induce pisatin production without any
obvious nuclease activity (Hadwiger et al., 1974).

REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES (ROS):
POTENTIAL SIGNALS IN CANCER AND
DISEASE RESISTANCE VIA DNA
DAMAGE
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production is a mechanism shared
by all non-surgical therapeutic approaches for cancers, including
chemotherapy radiotherapy and photodynamic therapy. ROS
are usually increased in cancer cells due to oncogene activation
and are involved in the initiation, progression and metastasis
of cancers. Thus, ROS are considered oncogenic (Wang and
Yi, 2008). Oxidative stress has a significant impact on the
progression of cancer and other human pathologies. It has a
global influence on chromatin structure, mediating a number
of cellular changes, including gene expression. This makes the
targeting of oxidative stress pathways important in the control
of cancer (Kreuz and Fischle, 2016). ROS in eukaryotic tissue
cause multiple DNA base changes, such as from thymine to
thymine glycol (Dizdaroglu and Jaruga, 2012) and 5-hydroxy
methyl-2-deoxy uridine (Chaung and Boorstein, 1997). Most
of these changes cause mismatches during DNA replication,
leading to mutagenesis. ROS are capable of directly altering plant
DNA. Application of hydrogen peroxide to pea endocarp tissue
increases DNA fragmentation and activates defense genes (PR
genes) (Tanaka and Hadwiger, 2017). Although direct effects on
the DNA are detectable in pea, it is likely that other damage
to the pea chromatin is involved and that the induction of
repair responses may occur as it does in animals. ROS mediate a
systemic signal network for developing plant immunity (Alvarez
et al., 1998). A part of this network is the DNA damage inflicted
by ROS. In pea tissue, this damage is associated with the post-
treatment period during which PR genes are activated (Tanaka
and Hadwiger, 2017).
Reactive oxygen species are induced in mammalian tissue
as an antimicrobial defense. Their importance is based on
the observation that individuals with deficiencies in generating
ROS are highly susceptible to infection by a broad range of
microbes. A likely mode of defense occurs following damage to
mitochondrial DNA. Interestingly, DNA repair mechanisms were
required to resist killing by ROS. Although ROS play a role,
direct killing may not be the key mechanism. ROS may affect
ROS-dependent signaling controls, such cytokine production

(Deffert et al., 2014). Excessive ROS can damage cellular proteins,
lipids and DNA, leading to fatal lesions in cells that contribute to
carcinogenesis. Low levels of ROS facilitate cancer cell survival.
High levels of ROS can suppress tumor growth through the
sustained activation of cell-cycle inhibitors and the induction of
cell death (Ramsey and Sharpless, 2006). A cancer cell can die
in three ways: apoptosis, necrosis and autophagy. The cytotoxic
nature of ROS is the driving force behind apoptosis, but with even
higher amounts, ROS can result in both apoptosis and necrosis,
a form of uncontrolled cell death in cancer cells (Hampton and
Orrenius, 1997).
OTHER POTENTIAL SIGNALS IN
DISEASE RESISTANCE VIA DNA
DAMAGE
It has been reported other potential signals for nonhost disease
resistance via DNA damage as shown in Figure 1 (Yan et al.,
2013; Hadwiger and Tanaka, 2015, 2017b). Another potential
signal for speculation is damage-associated molecular patterns
(DAMPs; Tanaka et al., 2014). For examples, extracellular DNA
that trigger plant immunity are in addition to the hypothesized
PAMPs discussed above. These signals are unique in that only
self-DNA fragments (Barbero et al., 2016; Duran-Flores and
Heil, 2018) and are active and maybe differ from the PAMPs
in that the likely target is host DNA rather than a pattern
recognition receptor located in the vicinity of the cell membrane.
The specificity of the self-DNA requirement and the rapidity
of the response were demonstrated by developing immunity in
common bean with extracellular DNA from other same species
plants and unsuccessfully from DNA from unrelated species.
The fragments all less than 700 bp suggest that the molecules
reach host DNA and that like other introduced DNA can
quickly find homologous regions in the genome. The mechanism
of action has not been unequivocally determined (Mazzoleni
et al., 2015a,b) but the presence of a homologous third strand
fragment is likely destructive or at least competitive to chromatin
organization in the homologous region. As indicated previously
seemingly minor changes in chromatin organization can effect
transcription. Interestingly, these externally applied DNAs can
also affect plant growth.
ESSENCE OF THE COMPILED
INFORMATION ON DNA DAMAGE IN
DISEASE RESISTANCE IN PLANTS AND
CANCER DEVELOPMENT IN ANIMALS
Multiple black boxes of unknown regulatory components are
prevalent within chromatin (Dekker et al., 2013). Such variations
in chromatin structures were demonstrated in the 1950s by
a cytologist looking at the bands within giant chromosomes
of Drosophila salivary glands. Regions sensitive to treatments
with hormones, DNA intercalators, heat, etc. were observed to
puff out from certain bands of the chromatin within the giant
chromosome. The multi-action damage of ROS to plant nuclei
activating defense responses may be more global in comparison
to activation by actinomycin D, which recognizes specific DNA
sequences. This actinomycin-DNA specificity results in more
direct action on sensitive areas of the chromatin (Lewis et al.,
1975), as visualized in the puffing effects on giant chromosomes
of Drosophila (Watson et al., 1987). In general, actinomycin
D prefers GpC regions. It binds to DNA by intercalating its
phenoxazine ring at a GpC step such that the two cyclic
pentapeptides of the drug area are located in the DNA minor
groove (Sobell and Jain, 1972). As the base sequence becomes
more deviant, there can be more radical changes. For example,
actinomycin D induces nucleotide flipping out, sharp bends and
a left-handed twist in CGG triplet repeats. Heat denaturation,
circular dichroism and surface plasmon resonance analyses
indicate that adjacent GpC sequences flanking a G:G mismatch
are preferred actinomycin D binding sites (Lo et al., 2013).
The detection of sensitive regions within chromatin regions of
pea chromosomes has been defined genetically as QTLs. The
mapping of these regions in pea detects some of the induced
defense genes residing within QTLs and thus may characterize
special features of the pea chromosome (Pilet-Nayel et al., 2002).

FIGURE 9 | Diagram of some DNA-direct effects of biological entities shown capable of activating disease resistance responses in plants. The minor
groove-localizing chitosan heptamer is released from the fungus by the plant chitinase and the fungal chitin deacetylase enzymes (Kendra et al., 1989). The DNA
torsion/helicity can be affected by small molecule binding/intercalation and single strand cleavage by Fusarium solani f. sp. phaseoli (Fsph)-DNase (Hadwiger and
Polashock, 2013). ROS released in the interaction (Tanaka and Hadwiger, 2017) have multiple ways to alter nuclear DNA. The isoflavonoid phytoalexins, e.g., pisatin
(Hadwiger, 2015a), and defensin (Almeida et al., 2006) are directly anti-fungal. Fsph DNase accumulation within Fsph terminates fungal growth (Hadwiger, 2015c).
PR genes such as DRR49 codes for RNase and DRR230 codes for defensin. Chitinase and β-glucanase that digest fungal chitin and glucan polymers, respectively
(Kendra et al., 1989) are present in healthy tissue and increase following fungal challenge. All proteins that transient the host–parasite interface are produced with a
N-terminal signal peptide for transfer through membranes (Hadwiger, 2009).
CONDENSED STATE OF DNA IN PLANT
CHROMATIN
Nucleosomes help condense the almost 1-m length of DNA
within a pea cell, and similarly in many other eukaryotic cells,
into the small volume of the nucleus of ∼10 microns in diameter
(Hadwiger and Adams, 1978). This fete is accomplished in part
in co-operation with nucleosomes. Each turn of the nuclear
DNA strand may contain six nucleosomes, as shown in the
Figure 8A, each composed of two molecules of the following
histone molecules: H3, H4, H2A, and H2B. This structure is stable
because of the electrostatic interaction between the negatively
charged DNA and the basic histones (Yaniv, 2014).
The presence of histones and the condensed structure of
chromatin restricts the access of specific proteins to DNA
sequences except when appropriate for transcription, repair, etc.
(Petesch and Lis, 2008; Pang et al., 2013; Mao et al., 2014).
Both RNA and DNA polymerases must separate the strands
of DNA. This can be accomplished enzymatically in eukaryotic
cells by helicases. Helicase motifs have been found in genetic
complexes (SNF genes in yeast that act in control of certain
other genes) (Neigeborn and Carlson, 1984). Re-expression of
the helicase in human cells previously lacking a helicase strongly
increased the expression of a glucocorticoid hormone receptor
(GR) (Muchardt and Yaniv, 1993). These examples suggest a
helicase function in DNA strand separation that assists the
transcription process.
The broad implication of complexes containing SNF genes
in cancer is that the loss or change in this activity can result
in a multitude of re-regulated cellular programs affecting cell
survival and cell death of malignant transformation and may
relate to the strand separating function of helicases. In plants,
the re-regulation of genes due to abnormal insults to organized
chromatin via pathogen invasion can also affect transcription
patterns for cell viability and cell death. Fortunately, there are
windows in this array in which previously suppressed genes can
become beneficial to the immune response of the plant tissue.
The signaling of such new gene expression levels with respect
to time after inoculation of an “
inappropriate”pathogen has
been defined as what is termed a nonhost resistance response

Anti-cancer Agents and Plant Immunity
(Hadwiger, 2015c). This early response is almost universally
observed as more excessive than the plant’
s response to pathogens
considered to be in the range of that particular plant species.
Plants have obviously diverted evolutionarily from animal
systems; however, there is a conservation of similarity in the
transcriptional machinery within plant and animal cells. It was
recognized early that the amino acid sequences of an array of
histone proteins in both plant and animal cells were highly
conserved. Additionally, there is some similarity in certain
transcription factors such as HMG A, which is regarded as an
architectural transcription factor with AT-hook motives within
the protein specific to AT-rich regions of the DNA (Klosterman
et al., 2000; Klosterman et al., 2003; Reeves, 2010). HMG A is
retained in both plant and animal systems. Plants and animals
also have SNF/SWI-like complexes that affect transcription
(Bezhani et al., 2007; Jerzmanowski, 2007; Sarnowska et al.,
2016).
A portion of the pea and cancer cell chromatin contain genes
with various states of activity ranging from open expression to
“
stalled”(Nelson et al., 2007). Stalled genes have obstructions
that are related to the state of transcription factors, DNA
helical obstructions and nuclear protein content. Therefore, it
is likely that chromatin modifications from agents with slightly
different modes of action can assume multiple changes increasing
(or suppressing) gene expression. Furthermore, because the
agents can possess differing base-sequence preferences, their
proximity to the genes expressed will also be an influencing
factor. Conformational states of chromatin in the vicinity of the
PR genes may effect transcription enhancement via nucleosome
disassembly or histone H2A/H2B releases similar to that found
in other eukaryotic systems (Adkins and Tyler, 2006; Weake and
Workman, 2008).
In plant cells, the production of pisatin can occur by the
amplification of a secondary metabolic pathway that depends
on increases in one or more enzymes. The induction of pisatin
is usually in synchronization with the activity of PR genes,
and both entities possess anti-fungal properties, thus implicating
regulatory enhancements in a group of plant genes. The same
DNA-specific agents confront similar chromatin structures in
animal cancer cells, but the medicinal objectives are intended
to negatively affect the viability of actively dividing cancer
cells. These negative properties of DNA-specific agents are often
acquired with high agent concentrations, it is inevitable that non-
targeted peripheral areas will receive diluted concentrations. The
results obtained in plant tissue suggest that there is the potential
for the lower concentrations of anti-cancer agents to cause a
different array of effects.
PERSPECTIVE SUMMARIZATION
Following DNA damage within human or plant cells, there is
an alteration of the repressed states of some genes encumbered
within the respective nuclei. The damage results in actions, such
as defense gene activation in plants and suppression of growth
in cancer cells with eventual side effects, including programmed
cell death (apoptosis). Many of the effects can be duplicated by
targeting nuclear DNA by eliciting agents with varying modes of
action, such as through DNA intercalation, DNA cleavage, base
substitution, nuclear protein modification, etc., that elicit varying
responses. This targeting of the sensitive chromatin regions by
chemically different agents can produce similar transcriptional
changes to those in real biological systems. This abiotic probing
provides insight into the biotic changes (Figure 9) experienced
by the nucleosomes of the nuclear chromatin of both plant and
animal cells. Because of the highly conserved components of
chromatin in plants and animal cells, the mechanisms of these
changes can have implications that are useful in understanding
both systems.
Transcription data over the decades have implicated DNA
torsional changes as central to the progression of RNA
polymerase complexes through gene open reading frames (Ma
et al., 2013). These enhancements of newly expressed genes
must remove the barricades of helical stress and nucleosome
condensation that restricts the ORF read through RNA
polymerase and the subsequent expression of defense and DNA
repair genes. A DNA-intercalating scenario may be to insert
into proximal DNA, reversing the negatively supercoiled or
dispersing nucleosome structure. Another action may be the
ubiquitination of histones H2A/H2B and removal from the area
downstream from the RNA polymerase complex (Figure 8B).
The enhancement of the defense responses in plants can occur
in a similar manner. In the latter case, it is the components of
the response, the antifungal compounds, that enable resistance.
In some plant/bacterial interactions, the complete killing of cells
surrounding the lesion is beneficial to resistance as well. The
lesson available from the plant responses for cancer therapy
is that elicitor-initiated gene activations occurring with low-
level treatments in plants may occur randomly at the fringes
of the high-level anticancer treatments and may activate genes
associated with adverse side effects.
The plant responses that develop from the large number
of eliciting agents tested on pea endocarp tissue (Figures 1,
Figures 9) indicate that cellular chromatin structural changes
relate to the presented chemistry of the agent without respect
for what a pharmaceutical company designates as the cellular
target. That is, the agent may be designated an antimalarial,
antidepressant drug, etc.; however, if there are potential
intercalating rings and positive charges exposed, the agent will
likely localize next to the negative charges of the DNA and
the resulting transcriptional changes will occur based on the
chemistry of the interaction.
