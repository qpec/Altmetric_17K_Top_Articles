IMPORTANCE Psychiatric comorbidities are common among patients with cancer. However,
whether or not there is increased risk of mental disorders during the diagnostic workup
leading to a cancer diagnosis was unknown.
OBJECTIVE To examine the relative risks of depression, anxiety, substance abuse,
somatoform/conversion disorder, and stress reaction/adjustment disorder during the periods
before and after cancer diagnosis compared with individuals without cancer.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Nationwide matched cohort study from January 1,
2001, to December 31, 2010, in a Swedish population and health registers.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES We estimated the time-varying hazard ratios (HRs) of the
first clinical diagnosis of the studied mental disorders from 2 years before cancer diagnosis,
through the time of diagnosis, and until 10 years after diagnosis, adjusting for age, sex,
calendar period, and educational level. To assess milder mental conditions and symptoms, we
further assessed the use of related psychiatric medications for patients with cancer
diagnosed during 2008-2009.
RESULTS The study included 304 118 patients with cancer and 3 041 174 cancer-free
individuals who were randomly selected from the Swedish population and individually
matched to the patients with cancer on year of birth and sex. The median age at diagnosis for
the patients with cancer was 69 years, and 46.9% of the patients were female. The relative
rate for all studied mental disorders started to increase from 10 months before cancer
diagnosis (HR, 1.1; 95% CI, 1.1-1.2), peaked during the first week after diagnosis (HR, 6.7; 95%
CI, 6.1-7.4), and decreased rapidly thereafter but remained elevated 10 years after diagnosis
(HR, 1.1; 95% CI, 1.1-1.2). The rate elevation was clear for all main cancers except nonmelanoma
skin cancer and was stronger for cancers of poorer prognosis. Compared with cancer-free
individuals, increased use of psychiatric medications was noted from 1 month before cancer
diagnosis and peaked around 3 months after diagnosis among patients with cancer.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Patients diagnosed as having cancer had increased risks of
several common mental disorders from the year before diagnosis. These findings support the
existing guidelines of integrating psychological management into cancer care and further call
for extended vigilance for multiple mental disorders starting from the time of the cancer
diagnostic workup.

P
atients with cancer are known to have an increased risk
of psychiatric symptoms and disorders,1 cardiovascu-
lar diseases,2 and suicide.3 Historically, severe comor-
bidities among patients with cancer have largely been attrib-
uted to the adverse effects of cancer treatments, the complex
pathophysiology of the underlying malignancy, or simply the
burden of living with a progressing and potentially fatal
disease.4,5 Not only does living with cancer induce severe psy-
chologicalstress,butbeingdiagnosedashavingacancerisalso
highlystressful.Recently,greatlyincreasedrisksofsuicideand
cardiovascular events shortly after cancer diagnosis were re-
portedamongpatientswithcancerindifferentcountries,across
various cancer types, and among both young and adult
patients.6-12 However, these reports likely only represent the
tip of the iceberg for the enormous psychological turmoil re-
lated to a newly received cancer diagnosis.
Psychiatriccomorbidities,suchasdepression,anxiety,sub-
stance abuse, somatoform/conversion disorder, and stress re-
action/adjustment disorder, are common among patients with
cancer1,13 and may reflect the broader spectrum of psychologi-
cal distress experienced by these patients. Although depres-
sion has been extensively studied,14 evidence is mainly lim-
ited to breast cancer15 and rarely addressed during the
immediate period after a cancer diagnosis.13 Moreover, other
mental disorders have received less attention.1,13 On the other
hand, although mental disorders are not established risk fac-
tors for cancer in general,16 some conditions, including addic-
tiontoalcoholandtobacco,mightleadtohigherriskofalcohol-
related and smoking-related cancers.17
Mostpreviousrelatedstudiesarecross-sectionalinnature,1
and a longitudinal description of the mental disorder burden
among patients with cancer is lacking to date. Furthermore,
most clinical and research efforts have addressed the postdi-
agnostic period of cancer, focusing on survivorship, the end-
of-life stage, and, increasingly, the immediate periods after di-
agnosis and primary cancer treatment.18-20 However,
accumulating evidence suggests that the cancer diagnostic
workup may also introduce severe psychological distress.21-24
Whether or not the diagnostic workup leading to a cancer di-
agnosis increases the risk of mental disorders is largely un-
known. To this end, we aimed to investigate risk changes in
several common and potentially stress-related mental disor-
ders from the cancer diagnostic workup to postdiagnosis.
Methods
Study Design
Based on the Swedish Population and Housing Census in 1990,
we identified all individuals born and living in Sweden in 1990
(N = 7 792 012). Using the unique national identification num-
bers, we followed up these individuals from January 1, 1991,
to December 31, 2010, through cross-linkages to the Swedish
Cancer Register, Patient Register, Prescribed Drug Register,
Cause of Death Register, and Migration Register. The Cancer
Register has been available since 1958 and approaches 100%
complete data. The Patient Register has collected nationwide
information on hospital discharge records since 1987 and on
more than 80% of hospital-based outpatient visits since 2001.
The Prescribed Drug Register collects information on drugs re-
deemed with a prescription from all pharmacies in Sweden
since July 2005, including prescription, dispensings, and the
Anatomic Therapeutic Chemical codes.
Within the nationwide study base, we subsequently con-
ducted a matched cohort study. We first identified 326 404
adult patients (≥18 years old) with a first diagnosis of malig-
nancy from January 1, 2001, to December 31, 2009. Cancer
cases detected through autopsy were excluded (n = 4221). In
the present study, we defined the 2 years before the date of
cancer diagnosis as the prediagnostic period, potentially rep-
resenting the time window from the emerging prediagnostic
cancer symptoms25,26 through the diagnostic workup.27 The
period from the date of cancer diagnosis onward was corre-
spondingly defined as the postdiagnostic period.
Because we aimed to study the effect of the cancer diag-
nostic workup on newly emerging mental disorders, individu-
als with previous psychiatric comorbidities before entry to the
cohort (ie, 2 years before the date of diagnosis) were ex-
cluded, leaving 304 118 patients with cancer in the analysis.
Wethenrandomlyselected10individualsperpatientwithcan-
cer from the study base who were free of cancer at the diag-
nosis date of the index patient with cancer (ie, the reference
date) and free of psychiatric comorbidities at entry to the co-
hort (ie, 2 years before the reference date) (n = 3 041 174). Pa-
tients with cancer and cancer-free individuals were individu-
allymatchedonyearofbirthandsex.Allparticipantswerethen
followedupfrom2yearsbeforethereferencedate(earliestpos-
sible entry on January 1, 1999) to a first diagnosis of mental
disorder, death, emigration, or December 31, 2010, which-
ever came first. Among all cancer-free individuals, 192 598
(6.3%) developed a cancer after the reference date, and fol-
low-up of these individuals was also censored at the cancer di-
agnosis. The study was approved by the Central Ethical
Review Board in Stockholm, Sweden, which waived the re-
quirement of obtaining informed consent from the study
participants.

Key Points
Question Is there increased risk of mental disorders, including
depression, anxiety, substance abuse, somatoform/conversion
disorder, and stress reaction/adjustment disorder, temporally
associated with the diagnostic workup leading to a cancer
diagnosis?
Findings In this nationwide matched cohort study, highly
increased risk of the aforementioned mental disorders was noted
from 10 months before cancer diagnosis, peaked during the first
week after diagnosis, and decreased rapidly thereafter but
remained elevated 10 years after diagnosis.
Meaning Extended vigilance for multiple mental disorders is
needed in cancer care, starting from the time of the cancer
diagnostic workup.

rectal,lung,nonmelanomaskin,centralnervoussystem(CNS),
lymphatic/hematopoietic, severe (pancreatic, hepatic, and
esophageal), and other cancers (eTable 1 in the Supplement).
We obtained information on tumor stage for prostate, breast,
colorectal, and lung cancers from the Cancer Register for pa-
tients diagnosed since 2004 onward. We defined T3/T4/N1-3
as locally advanced stage and M1 as distant metastasis.

To assess the potential importance of differential surveil-
lance of mental disorders between patients with cancer and
cancer-free individuals, in a sensitivity analysis, we used any
first-ever inpatient hospital visit with a mental disorder as the
main discharge diagnosis as the outcome of interest, assum-
ing that differential reporting is less relevant for severer
mental conditions.
Psychiatric Medications
To assess milder mental conditions and symptoms without at-
tended specialist care (not recorded in the Patient Register), we
furtherassessedtheuseofpsychiatricmedicationsrelatedtothe
studied mental disorders, including Anatomic Therapeutic
Chemical codes for antidepressants (code N06A), anxiolytics
(codeN05B),andhypnotics/sedatives(codeN05C)throughthe
Prescribed Drug Register. For this analysis, we included 68 104
patients with cancer and 681 040 cancer-free individuals with
areferencedateduring2008-2009.Theseparticipantswerefol-
lowedupfrom2yearsbeforethereferencedate(earliestpossible
entry on January 1, 2006) to death, emigration, December 31,
2011, or 2 years after the reference date, whichever came first.
Wedefinedcurrentuseofthestudiedmedicationsaspreviously
described.33 Briefly, we defined current use of antidepressants
or anxiolytics as the 4 months after each prescription claim,
whereaswedefinedcurrentuseofhypnotics/sedativesasthe10
days after each prescription claim.
Statistical Analysis
In the primary analysis, we investigated the rate of mental dis-
ordersfrom2yearsbeforediagnosis(year−2),throughthedate
of diagnosis, to 10 years after diagnosis (year 10). Given a gen-
erally violated proportional hazards assumption, we estimated
hazardratios(HRs)and95%CIsofthementaldisordersderived
from flexible parametric survival models, which allow the HRs
to change over time.34 Time since cohort entry was used as the
underlyingtimescale.Tocapturethedramaticallyincreasedrates
around the date of cancer diagnosis, HRs were modeled sepa-
ratelyfortheprediagnosticandpostdiagnosticperiods.Individu-
als with a mental disorder diagnosed during the prediagnostic
period were excluded from the analysis of the postdiagnostic
period (5316 patients with cancer and 37 170 cancer-free indi-
viduals).Thecorrespondingcancer-freeindividualsofthe5316
patients were also excluded (n = 52 481). We adjusted for the
matching variables, in addition to educational level, in all sur-
vival models as recommended.35
The analysis was further stratified by age, sex, calendar pe-
riod, educational level, and region of residence. We separately
analyzed 8 major cancer types and the 4 most common types,
aswellaslocallyadvancedandlocalizedcancersalongwithmeta-
staticandnonmetastaticcancers.Wefurthercomparedcancers
of poor prognosis (ie, lung, CNS, and severe cancers) with other
cancers.Finally,inadditiontocombiningallstudiedmentaldis-
orders as one group, we separately assessed rate changes of the
individual disorders. Given the overall lack of statistical power
during the first 6 months of follow-up (mainly due to few indi-
vidualswithanewlydiagnosedmentaldisorderamongpatients
with cancer), we focused on the period from 18 months before
cancer diagnosis onward in these subgroup analyses.
In addition to the aforementioned relative measure-
ments, we calculated the absolute risks of these mental dis-
ordersamongbothpatientswithcancerandtheirmatchedcan-
cer-free individuals by plotting cumulative incidence curves
for the individual disorders. Competing risk models were ap-
plied for the postdiagnostic period to control for higher mor-
tality rates among patients with cancer compared with their
cancer-free counterparts after diagnosis.

Hazard ratios were estimated from flexible parametric survival models, allowing
the effect of cancer diagnosis to vary over time. A spline with 5 df
(4 intermediate knots and 2 knots at each boundary, placed at quintiles of
distribution of events) was used for the baseline rate, while 3 df was used for
the time-varying effect. All models were adjusted for sex, age, and calendar
period at the reference date (2001-2003, 2004-2006, or 2007-2009) as well
as educational level (high, middle, or low/unknown).

In the secondary analysis, we calculated the proportions
for current use of any of the studied psychiatric medications
as well as specific medications from 18 months before cancer
diagnosis to 2 years after cancer diagnosis. After Bonferroni
correction for multiple testing, the differences in current use
on a daily basis between patients with cancer and cancer-free
individuals were examined using the χ2 test. Analyses were
performed using statistical software (SAS, version 9.4; SAS

a Hazard ratios at each time point were estimated from flexible parametric
survival models, allowing the effect of cancer diagnosis to vary over time.
A spline with 5 df (4 intermediate knots and 2 knots at each boundary, placed
at quintiles of distribution of events) was used for the baseline rate, while 3 df
was used for the time-varying effect. All models were adjusted for sex, age,
and calendar period at the reference date (2001-2003, 2004-2006, or
2007-2009) as well as educational level (high, middle, or low/unknown). The
highest educational level was retrieved from the Swedish Education Register
and classified into high (college and above), middle (9 years plus 2-3 years of
high school), low (<9 years), or unknown. The region of residence was
identified through the Swedish Population and Housing Census in 1990 and
classified into northern, central, and southern Sweden.

Results
The median age at diagnosis for the patients with cancer was
69 years, and 46.9% of the patients were female (eTable 1 in
the Supplement). In total, we identified 3355 patients and
10 296 patients with a new diagnosis of the studied mental dis-
orders during the prediagnostic period and the postdiagnos-
tic period, respectively.
The overall relative rate of mental disorders started to in-
crease from 10 months before cancer diagnosis (HR, 1.1; 95%
CI, 1.1-1.2) and peaked during the week after diagnosis
(Figure 1). Although the magnitude of the rate increase de-
creased rapidly thereafter, the rate remained elevated by year
10. Using only the main diagnosis of inpatient care as the defi-
nition for mental disorders (19.9% of all diagnoses) barely
changed the temporal pattern, although the magnitude of the
rate increase dropped slightly (eFigure 1 in the Supplement).
The rate increase immediately before and after cancer di-
agnosiswasgreateramongwomencomparedwithmen(Table).
Younger and better-educated patients had higher HRs after di-
agnosis but not before diagnosis compared with older and less-
educated patients.
Largely similar results were observed for all major cancer
types except nonmelanoma skin cancer (Figure 2). The rate in-
creasewasgreaterforcancersofpoorprognosisbothbeforeand
afterdiagnosiscomparedwithothercancers(P < .001forboth).
Patientswithlocallyadvancedormetastaticcancershadnofur-
therincreasedratecomparedwithpatientswithlocalizedornon-
metastatic cancers either before or after diagnosis (eTable 2 in
theSupplement).However,towardtheendoffollow-up,patients
with locally advanced cancer and those with metastatic breast
and lung cancers had greater rate increases than the others.
Largely similar results were also observed for all indi-
vidual mental disorders studied (Figure 3). The magnitude of
the rate elevation was comparable before cancer diagnosis
across all disorders, whereas the highest rate increase was
noted for stress reaction/adjustment disorder immediately
after cancer diagnosis.

Among patients with cancer, depression had the highest
cumulativeincidenceduringthestudy,followedbyanxietyand
stress reaction/adjustment disorder (eFigure 2 in the Supple-
ment). Compared with cancer-free individuals, patients with
cancer had higher cumulative incidences of most mental dis-
orders except somatoform/conversion disorder.
Increased use of psychiatric medications was noted from
1 month before cancer diagnosis (12.2% vs 11.7%, corrected
P = .04), peaked around 3 months after diagnosis (18.1% vs
11.9%, corrected P < .001), and decreased slowly thereafter but
remained elevated 2 years after diagnosis (15.4% vs 12.7%, cor-
rected P < .001) (Figure 4). Increased use was most pro-
nounced for lung, CNS, and severe cancers, whereas no in-
creased use was noted for nonmelanoma skin cancer. Findings
of specific psychiatric medications were similar (eFigure 3 in
the Supplement).
Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, our study represents the first
and largest study to date estimating the burden and its tem-
poral pattern of mental disorders that are potentially related
to psychological stress among adult patients with cancer dur-
ing the prediagnostic to postdiagnostic periods. In line with
previous studies,1,13 we showed that anxiety and stress reac-
tion/adjustment disorder were also common among patients
with cancer, in addition to depression. Most important, pa-
tients with cancer had dramatically increased risks of depres-
sion, anxiety, stress reaction/adjustment disorder, and sub-
stance abuse (excluding alcohol and tobacco abuse or
dependence),aswellassomatoform/conversiondisorder,both
during the year before and the year after diagnosis. The dra-
matic risk increases noted immediately after cancer diagno-
siscorroboratewithpreviousfindingsonhighlyincreasedrisks
of cardiovascular diseases and suicide right after cancer
diagnosis,6-12whereastheclearlyelevatedrisksduringtheyear
before diagnosis may suggest the effect of prediagnostic can-
cer symptoms as well as the severe stress of undergoing clini-
cal evaluation for a suspected malignancy.
To a varying extent, there was a similar pattern of risk el-
evation for most cancer types, with the smallest (if any) risk
increase observed for nonmelanoma skin cancer. Patients with
prostate cancer also had smaller risk elevation compared with
other cancers both before and after diagnosis, likely as a re-
sult of increasing knowledge about the disease and its per-
ceived benign prognosis in the general population.36 How-
ever, no clear variation was noted between either locally
advancedandlocalizedcancersorbetweenmetastaticandnon-
metastatic cancers until the end of the first year after diagno-
sis, when patients having the same cancers were compared
with each other. This pattern lends support to the view that,
during the diagnostic workup, the experience of psychologi-
cal distress does not highly correlate with the severity of a ma-
lignancy, which seems to be in line with previous findings that
theprevalenceofdepressionandpsychologicaldistressdidnot
differgreatlybytumorstage.1However,theslightlygreaterrisk
increase among patients with locally advanced cancer be-
yond 1 year after diagnosis might indicate a direct effect of the
disease course, treatment adverse effects, and disease coping
after the primary cancer treatment.
In Sweden, the waiting times during the cancer diagnos-
tic workup vary greatly across cancer types. In 2011, the
median intervals between the first referral to a specialist for

cancer evaluation and the final diagnosis were 11 to 12 days for
colorectal cancer and 76 to 82 days for nonmetastatic pros-
tate cancer.27 The process from the first symptom onset or the
first health care contact to the final diagnosis is presumably
much longer.27 Although data are scant, a growing body of evi-
dence suggests that the workup for a suspected cancer, re-
gardless of the eventual diagnosis result, clearly affects health
and well-being, particularly in terms of the psychosocial
spheres of function.22,24,37 Such effect is believed to be tran-
sient among individuals receiving an initial clear result (ie, no
evidence of cancer), whereas it is more persistent among in-
dividuals eventually diagnosed as having a malignancy.21
The start of risk increase for the studied mental disor-
ders around 10 months before cancer diagnosis may likely
suggest a debut of cancer symptoms at a population level, in
line with earlier reported increased sickness absence before
cancer diagnosis.26 Besides the potential effect of psycho-
logical stress experienced during the diagnostic workup,
prediagnostic cancer symptoms26 and paraneoplastic syn-
drome (eg, anemia25) may also contribute to the increased
risk of mental disorders and increased use of psychiatric
medications during the prediagnostic period. By contrast,
the fact that no clear risk increase was noted within the sec-
ond year before cancer diagnosis suggests that patients with
cancer did not have a higher risk of mental disorders at
baseline.
One limitation of our study is the use of clinical diagno-
ses through inpatient and outpatient specialist care as the
outcome measurement, which likely represented only more
severe demonstrations of the studied mental disorders. The
similar temporal pattern (but larger magnitude) of increased
use of psychiatric medications further implies the effect of
cancer diagnosis on both severe and milder mental condi-
tions. Therefore, taking together both clinical diagnoses and
medication use likely depicts the entire extent of mental
burden around the time of cancer diagnosis, highlighting
the clinical significance of our findings. However, because
the studied medications are not exclusively prescribed for
mental disorders or symptoms, future studies should
specify the underlying reasons for prescription of such
medications.
Registerdiagnosesofdepression,anxiety,substanceabuse,
and stress reaction/adjustment disorder have been shown to
be of good quality in general.38-41 The validity of conversion
disorder diagnosis might remain a concern. Because it is rare
(5% of all somatoform/conversion disorders), results of

cluding conversion disorder.
We had no information on the exact time course of can-
cer diagnosis and were unable to disentangle whether the reg-
istered date of diagnosis coincided with the date when the pa-
tient was informed about the diagnosis. Therefore, further
studies with detailed information on the cancer diagnostic
workup are warranted. Although our findings highlight the im-
portanceofatimelypsychologicalinterventionthroughoutthe

needs to be investigated.

Conclusions
Patients recently diagnosed as having cancer experience dra-
matically increased risks of several potentially stress-related
mental disorders both immediately before and after cancer di-
agnosis. Our findings support the existing guidelines of inte-
grating psychological management into cancer care42 and call
for extended vigilance for multiple mental disorders starting
from the time of the cancer diagnostic workup.
