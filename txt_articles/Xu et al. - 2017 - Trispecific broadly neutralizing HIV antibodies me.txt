The development of an effective AIDS vaccine has been challenging because of viral
genetic diversity and the difficulty of generating broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs).
We engineered trispecific antibodies (Abs) that allow a single molecule to interact with
three independent HIV-1 envelope determinants: the CD4 binding site, the membrane-
proximal external region (MPER), and the V1V2 glycan site. Trispecific Abs exhibited higher
potency and breadth than any previously described single bnAb, showed pharmacokinetics
similar to those of human bnAbs, and conferred complete immunity against a mixture of
simian-human immunodeficiency viruses (SHIVs) in nonhuman primates, in contrast to
single bnAbs. Trispecific Abs thus constitute a platform to engage multiple therapeutic
targets through a single protein, and they may be applicable for treatment of diverse
diseases, including infections, cancer, and autoimmunity.
A
variety of broadly neutralizing antibodies
(bnAbs) have been isolated from HIV-1–
infected individuals (1–3), but their poten-
tial to treat or prevent infection in humans
may be limited by the potency or breadth
of viruses neutralized (4, 5). The targets of these
antibodies have been defined according to an
understanding of the HIV-1 envelope structure
(6–9). Although bnAbs occur in selected HIV-1–
infected individuals (usually after several years
of infection), it remains a challenge to elicit them
by vaccination because broad and potent HIV-
1 neutralization often requires unusual antibody
characteristics, such as long hypervariable loops,
interaction with glycans, and a substantial level
of somatic mutation. Strategies have thusshifted
from active to passive immunization, both to pro-
tect against infection and to target latent virus
(10–14).
We and others have begun to explore com-
binations of bnAbs that optimize potency and
breadth of protection, thus reducing the likeli-
hood of resistance and viral escape (15–17). Anti-
bodies directed to the CD4 binding site (CD4bs),
membrane-proximal external region (MPER),
and variable-region glycans are among the com-
binations that so far provide optimal neutraliza-
tion (18). In addition, alternative combinations
have also been investigated for the immunotherapy
of AIDS, specifically by directing T lymphocytes
to activate latent viral gene expression and en-
hance lysis of virally infected cells (19, 20). Be-
cause multiple antibodies may help to reduce the
viral replication that sustains chronic HIV-1 in-
fection, we report here the generation of multi-
specific antibodies designed to increase the
potential efficacy of HIV-1 antibodies for preven-
tion or therapy.
Design of bispecific antibodies and
evaluation of neutralization breadth
Although individual anti–HIV-1 bnAbs can neu-
tralize naturally occurring viral isolates with high
potency, the percentage of strains inhibited by
these monoclonal Abs (mAbs) varies (21, 22). In
addition, resistant viruses can be found in the
same patients from whom bnAbs were isolated,
which suggests that immune pressure against a
single epitope may not optimally treat HIV-1
infection or protect against it. We hypothesized
that the breadth and potency of HIV-1 neutral-
ization by a single antibody could be increased
by combining the specificities against different
epitopes into a single molecule. This strategy
would be expected not only to improve efficacy
but also to simplify treatment regimens, as well
as the regulatory issues required for clinical
development.
To test this concept, we initially incorporated
prototype bnAbs to the CD4bs and MPER sites
into a modified bispecific Ab. When two var-
iable regions are linked in tandem, the distal
site typically retains its ability to bind antigen
while the proximal binding is markedly dimin-
ished. We therefore used an alternative configu-
ration, termed CODV-Ig, that introduced linkers
and inverted the order of the antibody bind-
ing site in light and heavy chains to alter the
orientation of the variable regions, allowing each
region to interact with its target (23). Several
known bnAbs, including VRC01, 10E8, PGT121,
and PGT128 [reviewed in (1)], were evaluated for
their ability to neutralize a select panel of viruses
with known resistance or sensitivity to these anti-
bodies (fig. S1). Initially, we determined whether
the position of the variable regions from VRC01
and 10E8 in the proximal or distal positions (Fig.
1A) could affect neutralization breadth and po-
tency. Inclusion of both variable regions in either
orientation in the bispecific antibody reduced
the number of resistant strains relative to the
parental antibodies alone (Fig. 1B). Better po-
tency was observed when VRC01 was proximal
and 10E8 distal, although neither bispecific anti-
body was as potent as a mixture of the two anti-
bodies alone.
To explore whether other bnAbs could perform
better in the bispecific format, we evaluated two
different combinations: VRC01 plus PGT121, or
VRC01 plus PGT128. For PGT121, expression was
observed only with VRC01 in the distal position.
When this antibody was compared to the paren-
tal antibodies alone, it provided marginally better
neutralization (Fig. 2A). In contrast, VRC01 could
be expressed with PGT128 in both positions, with
greater breadth observed when VRC01 was distal
(Fig. 2B). Together, these data indicate that im-
provements in breadth could be achieved with a
bispecific format; however, in this case, the po-
tency was not consistently improved relative to
each Ab alone. We therefore sought an alterna-
tive format to improve the potency and breadth
of neutralization.
Generation and comparison of broad
and potent trispecific antibodies
To achieve our goal, we used a previously un-
described trispecific Ab format. Three speci-
ficities were combined by using knob-in-hole
heterodimerization (24) to pair a single arm de-
rived from a normal immunoglobulin (IgG) with
a double arm generated in the CODV-Ig. A panel
of bnAbs was evaluated, including those directed
against the CD4bs that included VRC01 and N6,
as well as PGT121, PGDM1400, and 10E8 (fig. S1).
A modified version of the latter, termed 10E8v4,
was used because of its greater solubility (25).
We first determined which bispecific arms showed
the best potency, breadth, and yield. This screen-
ing analysis revealed that combinations contain-
ing PGDM1400, CD4bs, and 10E8v4 showed the
highest level of production and greatest potency
of neutralization (fig. S2).

 We then evaluated different combinations of
single-arm and double-arm specificities from
PGDM1400, CD4bs, and 10E8v4 Abs for their
expression levels and activity against a small
panel of viruses (fig. S3), leading ultimately to
the identification of trispecific antibodies VRC01/
PGDM1400-10E8v4 and N6/PGDM1400-10E8v4
as lead candidates. When analyzed against a
panel of 208 viruses (18) and compared to the
parental antibodies alone, the highest neutrali-
zation potency and breadth were observed with
N6/PGDM1400-10E8v4, with only 1 of the 208
viruses showing neutralization resistance and a
median inhibitory concentration (IC50) of less than
0.02 mg/ml (Fig. 3A). VRC01/PGDM1400-10E8v4
also displayed high potency and breadth, and
only four resistant viruses were found. Some
parental mAbs displayed either high breadth
(e.g., 10E8, N6) or high potency (PGDM1400),
but none displayed a combination of breadth
and potency as optimal as the trispecific Abs
(Fig. 3B). For example, the most potent and broad
parental mAb, N6, was around 20% as potent as
the N6/PGDM1400-10E8v4 trispecific Ab and
targeted only a single epitope, which could in-
crease the chance of viral escape mutations. As a
single recombinant protein, the trispecific Abs dem-
onstrated potency and breadth superior to any
single antibody yet defined (Fig. 3 and fig. S4).
We also determined the binding affinity of
each component of the trispecific Ab and com-
pared each to its parental Fab. The equilibrium
binding constant Kd of each binding site in the
trispecific Ab, determined by surface plasmon
resonance, was comparable to the affinity of the
parental Fab, with PGDM1400 showing a slight
decrease in affinity (factor of ~3) and VRC01 and
10E8v4 exhibiting approximately a logarithmic
increase (fig. S5). In addition, the trispecific Ab
was able to bind sequentially to each of the three
antigens (Fig. 3C), indicating that there is inde-
pendent binding of each epitope.
The N6 trispecific Ab also showed greater
potency and breadth relative to three related
bispecific Abs when tested against a panel of
20 viruses that were selected for resistance to
bnAbs (table S1). This finding is consistent with
previous studies comparing the efficacy of mix-
tures of two versus three bnAbs (18) and pro-
vides additional support for the multitargeting
concept. In addition to their greater efficacy,
the trispecific Abs also yielded higher protein
levels and greater solubility than the bispecific
model (compare fig. S2A and fig. S3), which
would facilitate large-scale production and clin-
ical translation.
Fc modification to extend half-life and
crystal structure
To identify the optimal candidate for further
development, we determined the half-life of the
trispecific Abs in nonhuman primates (NHPs).
We previously showed that in the context of the
VRC01 mAb, mutations that increased binding
to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), which recycles
IgG in intestinal epithelial cells and increases
levels in the serum, extended half-life, enhanced

 mucosal localization, and conferred more efficient
protection against lentivirus infection relative to
the wild-type antibody (26). One such mutation
was incorporated into the trispecific Abs as well
as the parental VRC01 and N6 Abs. Abs were
then infused into rhesus macaques, and serum
levels were analyzed over a 14-day time frame.
Ab VRC01 displayed a longer half-life than the
more broad and potent N6, which was also di-
rected to the CD4bs (Fig. 4, VRC01 versus N6).
Similarly, the trispecific Ab containing VRC01
showed greater persistence and a longer half-
life (7.43 days, based on day 1–day 14 serum con-
centrations) than the N6 trispecific (4.79 days) in
vivo (Fig. 4, VRC01/PGDM1400-10E8v4 and N6/
PGDM1400-10E8v4). For this reason, and because
the N6 trispecific Ab yielded less product with
decreased solubility, we studied the VRC01/
PGDM1400-10E8v4 trispecific Ab further.
Further characterization was performed by
solving the crystal structure of the bispecific
arm of the trispecific Ab, PGDM1400-10E8v4
CODV Fab, at 3.55 Å resolution (Fig. 5, A and B).
The light chain was well resolved in the electron
density (with the exception of the two most
C-terminal residues), whereas the heavy chain
showed some regions of dynamic disorder.
The most notable region consisted of part of
PGDM1400 complementary-determining region
heavy chain 3 (CDRH3) and the linker between
PGDM1400 Fv and the heavy chain constant
domain (residues 280 to 305). Similar to the
anti–interleukin-4 (IL-4)/IL-13 CODV Fab crystal
structures (23), the PGDM1400 and 10E8v4 Fvs
opposed one another, with the CDRs well ex-
posed to the solvent. The distance between the
CDRH3s of PGDM1400 and 10E8v4 exceeded
100 Å. The PGDM1400 and 10E8v4 Fvs super-
posed very well with their respective parental
Fv structures [RMSD (Ca) ≈ 1 Å] (fig. S6) (25, 27),
confirming that their antigen-binding properties
have been well preserved in the CODV format.
Most important, the orientations of the CDRs
in two Fvs were 180° from each other, which
suggests that each antibody-combining site can
independently engage its antigen without ob-
structing the other Fv structure. A model for the
trispecific Ab was constructed by combining the
PGDM1400-10E8v4 CODV Fab with VRC01 (6)
and the intact b12 (28) IgG crystal structures
(Fig. 5C). Similar to a natural IgG, the distance
between the monovalent fragment of antigen
binding (Fab) and CODV Fab was about 150 Å.
Two of three antigens (gp120 core and gp41
MPER) were also included in the model, although
we do not have direct evidence that all three HIV
epitopes can be engaged simultaneously by a
single trispecific Ab.
Enhanced cross-protection and
decreased viral escape in vivo
To evaluate the VRC01/PGDM1400-10E8v4 tri-
specific Ab for its ability to protect against in-
fection, we used a mixture of two SHIVs that
each differed in neutralization sensitivity to
the parental bnAbs. In vitro assessment of the
replication-competent SHIV challenge stocks
showed that SHIV BaLP4 was sensitive to VRC01
and the trispecific antibody but was resistant
to PGDM1400 (Fig. 6A). In contrast, SHIV 325C
virus was sensitive to PGDM1400 and the tri-
specific Ab but was resistant to VRC01 (Fig. 6A).
In a neutralization assay with an equal mixture
of SHIV BaLP4 and SHIV 325c, we observed
that the trispecific Ab could achieve complete
neutralization of the viral mixture, whereas
VRC01 or PGDM1400 could not (fig. S7). When
naïve rhesus macaques were infused with the
half-life–extended VRC01, PGDM1400, or VRC01/
PGDM1400-10E8v4 (5 mg/kg), respectively, serum
concentrations were maintained at levels of
≥1 mg/ml for more than 14 days for all Abs (Fig. 6B).

 the trispecific Ab correlated with the development
of monkey anti-human Abs but arose almost
2 weeks after the SHIV challenge.
To ensure an adequate challenge dose, we
first challenged naïve animals with each virus
independently. For SHIV 325c, four naïve rhesus
macaques were inoculated one time intrarectally
with 1 ml of undiluted viral stock. All four ani-
mals were infected and showed persistent vire-
mia for up to 90 days (fig. S8). For SHIV BaLP4,
the same stock and dose of virus were used as
described in several of our prior publications
(26, 29, 30). In total, 30 control animals were
previously challenged with a single 1-ml intra-
rectal inoculation of SHIV BaLP4, and all became
infected.
To assess in vivo protection, we challenged
NHPs mucosally with a mixture of these dif-
ferentially sensitive SHIVs, 5 days after Ab in-
fusion in two separate experiments, with four
animals in each group. In total, six of eight
macaques (75%) infused with VRC01 alone, and
five of eight animals (62%) treated solely with
PGDM1400, became infected. In contrast, none
of the eight animals in the trispecific-treated
group were infected (Fig. 6C; P = 0.0058, two-
tailed Fisher exact test). These data confirm that
the improved breadth and potency of the tri-
specific Ab conferred protection against viruses
that otherwise show resistance to single bnAbs
alone.
Discussion
Next-generation HIV-1 bnAbs
A hallmark of HIV-1 infection is the remarkable
genetic diversity of the virus. Since 2010, sub-
stantial progress has been made in the identi-
fication of bnAbs that show exceptional breadth
and potency [reviewed in (1)]. Several of these
antibodies have progressed into clinical trials
for prevention or treatment, and there is renewed
interest in exploring their potential in the clinical
management of HIV-1 infection (5, 12, 14). Here,
we explored the potential of different bnAbs to
combine into a single protein that confers pro-
tection against diverse HIV-1 strains. Among the
classes of bnAbs, we found that trispecific Abs
derived from bnAbs with CD4bs, MPER, and
V1V2 glycan specificities had broad specificity,
were potent, and could be produced in sufficient
quantities to allow evaluation in NHPs and even-
tually in humans. When tested in NHPs with vi-
ruses resistant to individual parental bnAbs, the
trispecific Ab demonstrated complete protection
against both viruses, whereas infection was es-
tablished in most animals treated with individ-
ual parental antibodies VRC01 and PDGM1400.
In addition, the ability of this trispecific Ab to
target three independent epitopes may improve
treatment efficacy in humans.
In HIV-1–infected patients, reductions in viral
load have been observed after one infusion of a
single bnAb, thus demonstrating the biological
activity of HIV-1 bnAbs (31–34). A modest exten-
sion of viral rebound was also observed when
individual bnAbs were infused after antiretroviral
drugs were discontinued in previously suppressed
HIV-1–infected subjects (32, 33). NHP and human
passive transfer studies have also suggested that
such bnAbs can enhance antiviral immunity that
may contribute to improved viral control (35, 36).
In addition, NHP studies demonstrate the im-
portance of mAb potency and prolonged anti-
body half-life in mediating protection against
infection (26, 29). The generation of trispecific
Abs with improved potency and breadth may
further enhance the efficacy of either passive im-
munity or passive-active immunization strategies.
Although bnAbs show exceptional breadth and
potency, resistant viral strains have been de-
tected in patients who make these Abs (6, 37)
and among natural viral isolates (38–40), raising
the concern that resistance and escape mutations
may arise. Such escape mutations are produced
frequently with antiviral drug therapy (41), and
countermeasures to reduce the likelihood of
escape would increase the likelihood of develop-
ing a globally relevant therapy. Such breadth of
coverage might alternatively be generated by
administering multiple bnAbs, and protective
efficacy in a NHP model has recently been dem-
onstrated against a mixture of SHIV viruses using
an antibody cocktail (42), providing further sup-
port for the multitargeting concept. Combination
mAb therapy increases the complexity, develop-
ment pathway, cost, and regulatory burdens of
their use for treatment or prevention, in contrast
to a single biologic therapy. The potency of the
trispecific Abs described here also exceeds that
of a broad and potent recombinant form of CD4
(43), termed eCD4-Ig (fig. S4), and this latter
molecule is also directed to a single, albeit highly
conserved, HIV-1 Env epitope. The availability of a
single protein that targets multiple independent
epitopes on virus also reduces the potential
generation of escape mutations. This advantage
could be related, in part, to the presence of three
independent binding specificities at all times, in
contrast to mixtures of antibodies where selec-
tive pressure by individual mAbs with shorter
half-lives may wane.
Clinical translation
The trispecific Abs have not yet been evaluated
for safety and efficacy in humans. Initial char-
acterization of their half-life in NHPs suggests
that they behave similarly to conventional anti-
bodies, but it remains unknown whether they
could be immunogenic in vivo. The administra-
tion of a bispecific antibody to the human cyto-
kines IL-4 and IL-13, which uses a related format
and linkers (44), may provide guidance in this
regard. This bispecific antibody has been evalu-
ated in humans, where single subcutaneous doses
of SAR156597, ranging from 10 to 300 mg/kg,
were well tolerated in healthy subjects, with low
titers of anti-drug antibody (ADA) in only 4 of
36 subjects (44). This trial showed a mean half-life
of about 2 weeks (44), similar to natural mAbs.

 Although further human trials are needed
to assess the full potential of the trispecific Ab
platform, the data from the NHP challenge study
described here, as well as the previous experience
in humans with bispecific Abs (44), suggest that
the approach merits further clinical investiga-
tion. Studies in HIV-infected subjects, alone or in
combination with other immune interventions,
will address the potential of trispecific Abs to
provide durable protective immunity against in-
fection or sustained viral control in HIV-infected
subjects during drug holidays or in the absence
of antiretroviral therapy. The recognition of in-
dependent target sites with multispecific anti-
bodies can also be applied to other infectious
diseases, cancer, and autoimmunity. These anti-
bodies can promote recognition and binding to
critical antigenic determinants on target cells
while simultaneously allowing engagement of
immune cells that can stimulate relevant effec-
tor function without the complications and ex-
pense of delivering multiple recombinant proteins.

levels, and viremia in rhesus macaques. (A) IC50 neutralizing titers, in mg/ml, of VRC01, PGDM1400,
and VRC01/PGDM1400-10E8v4 against replication-competent SHIV BaLP4 or SHIV 325c, with colors
as in Fig. 1. (B) Plasma levels of VRC01, PGDM1400, and VRC01/PGDM1400-10E8v4 in rhesus
macaques (n = 8 on each arm, done in two separate experiments with four animals each). All animals
were administered 5 mg/kg of the indicated antibody intravenously. Each data point represents the
mean ± SEM of the values from all eight animals per group. (C) Plasma viral loads in rhesus macaques
(n = 8 per group) challenged with a mixture of SHIV BaLP4 and SHIV 325c, 5 days after intravenous
administration of VRC01, PGDM1400, or VRC01/PGDM1400-10E8v4.
