Morbidly obese patients exhibit impaired secretion of gut hormones that may contribute to the 
development of obesity. After bariatric surgery there is a dramatic increase in gut hormone release. 
In this study, gastric and duodenal tissues were endoscopically collected from lean, and morbidly 
obese subjects before and 3 months after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). Tissue morphology, 
abundance of chromogranin A, gut hormones, α
-defensin, mucin 2, Na+/glucose co-transporter 1 
(SGLT1) and transcription factors, Hes1, HATH1, NeuroD1, and Ngn3, were determined. In obese 
patients, the total number of enteroendocrine cells (EEC) and EECs containing gut hormones were 
significantly reduced in the stomach and duodenum, compared to lean, and returned to normality post-
LSG. No changes in villus height/crypt depth were observed. A significant increase in mucin 2 and SGLT1 
expression was detected in the obese duodenum. Expression levels of transcription factors required 
for differentiation of absorptive and secretory cell lineages were altered. We propose that in obesity, 
there is deregulation in differentiation of intestinal epithelial cell lineages that may influence the levels 
of released gut hormones. Post-LSG cellular differentiation profile is restored. An understanding of 
molecular mechanisms controlling epithelial cell differentiation in the obese intestine assists in the 
development of non-invasive therapeutic strategies.
Obesity and its associated conditions, such as type-2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, are major health threats 
worldwide. This condition is partly caused by inability to sense satiation after meals. The intestinal epithelium is 
a site of satiation signal generation, where specialized enteroendocrine (sensor) cells (EECs) respond to nutrients 
by releasing hormones that control energy homeostasis, food intake and insulin secretion1, 2.
EECs, dispersed among the cells lining the intestinal epithelium, represent approximately 1% of the entire gut 
epithelial cell population, but together they constitute the largest endocrine organ of the body. Traditionally it 
has been accepted that the discrete cell types that make up the EEC family have a distinct hormonal profile and 
localisation along the length of the gut3. However, recent investigations have shown that the one hormone, one 
cell dogma may not always be correct, and that there are more complex patterns of gut hormone co-localisation

in EECs4. In general, cholecystokinin (CCK) is released by I-cells predominantly located in the proximal small 
intestine, whereas peptide YY (PYY) and glucagon-like peptide 1 and 2 (GLP-1, GLP-2) are secreted predomi-
nantly by L-cells residing mostly in the distal gut5–7. However, L-cells have also been identified in the duodenum 
with higher numbers observed in jejunum and ileum8. CCK, GLP-1and PYY regulate gastric emptying and food 
intake, with GLP-1 also functioning as an incretin hormone, stimulating insulin secretion9, 10. Ghrelin is released 
by enteroendocrine X/A cells of the stomach, and by open-type EECs of the duodenum, acting as an orexigenic 
hormone, stimulating appetite and food intake11–13.
Absorptive enterocytes, mucus-producing goblet cells and Paneth cells are the other epithelial cells lining 
the intestine. All four cell types differentiate from common pluripotent stem cells located near the base of the 
crypt compartment of the intestine. Cell labelling kinetics has indicated that absorptive enterocytes, goblet and 
enteroendocrine cells migrate up the crypt-villus axis turning over every 3–4 days, whereas Paneth cells migrate 
downwards to the crypt base being renewed with a much slower turnover of approximately 21 days14.
Absorptive enterocytes are the most abundant cell type in the small intestine (~90%), and they participate 
mainly in transcellular transport of nutrients15. Goblet cells are the most copious secretory lineage of the intes-
tinal epithelia, comprising up to 10% of small intestinal epithelial cells16. They produce and secrete mucus to 
provide epithelial cells a protective shield against noxious luminal contents. Paneth cells produce antimicrobial 
peptides such as defensins that are secreted into the lumen of the intestine17.
The Notch pathway plays a critical role in intestinal epithelial cell fate by regulating the choice of absorptive 
versus secretory lineages. Notch induces stem cells to express Hes1, a transcription factor proposed to be one of 
the primary mediators of intestinal Notch signals. Hes1 represses HATH1, a specific secretory lineage transcrip-
tion factor and thus driving cells to become absorptive enterocytes16. In Hes1 deficient mice, HATH1 expression 
is increased leading to fewer absorptive enterocytes and increased goblet and endocrine cells18.
Differentiation of EECs is controlled by the sequential expression of HATH1 and two other basic 
helix-loop-helix transcription factors, Neurogenin 3 (Ngn3) and NeuroD1. HATH 1 is required for specification 
and segregation of the intestinal secretory lineage (Paneth, goblet and enteroendocrine cells) from the absorptive 
enterocyte lineage. Ngn3 expression represents the earliest stage of enteroendocrine differentiation and in its 
absence enteroendocrine cells fail to develop19. Subsequent expression of NeuroD1 appears to represent a later 
stage of differentiation for maturing EECs. Enteroendocrine cell fate is inhibited by the Notch signalling pathway, 
which appears to inhibit both HATH1 and Ngn319. Recent studies demonstrating increased numbers of EECs, 
reduced number of goblet cells, and absence of Paneth cells in Gfi-1 transcription factor-null mice propose addi-
tional secretory precursors segregating from HATH-1 dependent cells20.
Morbidly obese patients exhibit impaired secretion of gut hormones CCK, GLP-1 and PYY that may contrib-
ute to the development of obesity. Certain bariatric procedures such as Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and 
laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) cause weight loss and induce changes in both gut hormone and insulin 
secretion, together with improvements in glucose metabolism10, 21, 22.
LSG is becoming a widely used method in the treatment of morbid obesity. In 2011 almost 30% of all bariatric 
interventions performed worldwide were LSGs23. It has proved to be effective in terms of sustainable weight loss 
and amelioration of co- morbidities such as arterial hypertension and glucose intolerance, amongst others24, 25. 
This is probably achieved by a combination of reduction in stomach volume capacity, acceleration of food passage 
and hormonal changes21, 25–27. In obese individuals, gut hormone secretion is impaired with lower postprandial 
levels of circulating CCK, GLP-1 and PYY28–30. The concentrations of fasting ghrelin in the majority of obese are 
lower than normal-weight individuals, and they do not show a calorie-dependent suppression in postprandial 
circulating ghrelin as observed in normal weight volunteers31. Meal stimulation before and after bariatric surgery 
reveals dramatic increases in circulatory levels of gut hormones such as GLP-1, PYY and CCK as early as one 
week after intervention, well before weight loss occurs10. The effect of increased secretion of GLP-1 and PYY after 
bariatric surgery is not well understood, but the mechanism underlying this over-secretion in RYGB has been 
proposed to be due to accelerated travel of nutrients to the distal gut32; this proposed mechanism however does 
not entirely explain increased gut hormone secretion in LSG.
We hypothesised that there is a decrease in the number of EECs in obese subjects and that this decrease con-
tributes to the observed decline in postprandial gut hormone levels. Furthermore, we aimed to understand the 
causal processes of increased gut hormone release after LSG.
In this study, we first confirmed that there is a significant increase in postprandial GLP-1, PYY and CCK 
release in a cohort of morbidly obese subjects 3 months post LSG compared to that in the same individuals, pre 
LSG. A concurrent decrease in circulating ghrelin levels was also seen post LSG. Subsequently, we demonstrated 
in a separate, but comparable, cohort of morbidly obese subjects, from whom we could secure consent for obtain-
ing stomach and duodenal biopsies, that there is a significant decrease in the total number of EECs in the stomach 
and the duodenum, compared to lean subjects. EEC numbers were restored post-operatively. There were no 
changes in villus height and crypt depth between the two groups. Furthermore, in obese individuals, there was a 
significant increase in the expression levels of the intestinal glucose transporter, SGLT1 (a marker of absorptive 
enterocytes), and the major component of intestinal mucus, mucin 2 (an indicator of goblet cells), indicating that 
there is deregulation of processes controlling cellular differentiation. Accordingly, we demonstrated that protein 
abundance of transcription factors required for differentiation of intestinal absorptive and secretory cell lineages 
was also altered; these were returned to normality after LSG.
Understanding mechanisms underlying deregulation of intestinal epithelial cell differentiation in obesity may 
facilitate identifying potential targets for preventing or treating obesity and associated conditions.

ment: [fasting insulin ×

at 3 months post-LSG (Table 1 and Figure S1). A significant increase in postprandial GLP-1, PYY and CCK-
responses were shown with 2.9- (p < 0.001), 5.7- (p < 0.001) and 1.7-fold (p < 0.01) increases in maximum plasma 
concentrations of CCK, GLP-1 and PYY, respectively, in 3 month post-operative patients (Table 1 and Figure S1). 
Pre-operatively, area under the curve values for each hormone were significantly lower (Table 1 and Figure S1). 
A concurrent 1.7-fold (p < 0.001) decrease in circulating ghrelin levels was also seen 3 months post-operative 
(Table 1 and Figure S1). Our investigations indicated that age did not affect the hormone responses.
Determination of tissue expression of gut hormones in the stomach and duodenum of mor-
bidly obese subjects (Group 2). 
Twenty seven non-diabetic morbidly obese subjects, who consented to 
provide stomach and duodenal biopsies pre- and post- LSG, were used in this study. There were 6 drop-outs (5 
patients did not want to come back after surgery, one patient had an incidental finding of antrum carcinoma 
and had to be excluded). Of the morbidly obese patients, 21.1% (7/33) were positive for Helicobacter pylori 
preoperatively. After surgery there was a marked reduction in BMI from 47.2 ± 1.7 kg/m2 (range: 35.6–75.7) to 
39.3 ± 1.4 kg/m2 (range: 27.1–53.2). The control group consisted of 24 healthy lean subjects (Table 2).
Assessment of chromogranin A- and ghrelin-containing EECs in the stomach. Using immunohistochemistry, we 
showed that there was a 2.2- (p < 0.001) and 2.7-fold (p < 0.001) decline in the total number of chromogranin 
A (ChA)-containing EECs in the lesser and greater curvature of the stomach, respectively, in obese compared 
to lean individuals. In the same obese individuals post-operatively there was a 1.6-fold (p < 0.05) increase in 
the number of these cells in the lesser curvature compared to pre-LSG (Figure S2 and Table S1). Tissues from 
the greater curvature were no longer available after surgery to be compared. Using an average cell count of 500, 
we observed a 2.5- (p < 0.001) and 2.8-fold (p < 0.001) decrease in EECs containing ghrelin in the lesser and 
greater curvature respectively, in the obese stomach compared to lean. The number of ghrelin-containing cells 
was increased 1.5-fold (p < 0.05) in lower curvature of post-operative vs. pre-operative obese subjects, however 
this was still 1.5-fold (p < 0.05) lower than lean controls. We showed that the greater and lesser curvature of the

stomach do not contain EECs possessing CCK, GLP-1, GLP-2 or PYY. The total number of cells counted that 
contain ChA and ghrelin is given in Table S1.
Assessment of the number of chromogranin A and gut hormone containing EECs in the duodenum. By immu-
nohistochemistry we demonstrated that there was a 1.7-fold (p < 0.001) decrease in the total number of EECs 
in the duodenum of obese patients compared to lean controls (Fig. 1A and Table S1). Using qPCR, a 1.8-fold 
(p < 0.05) reduction in ChA mRNA expression was also observed in obese duodenal biopsies, compared to lean 
controls (Fig. 2). The population of EECs in the duodenum, determined by immunohistochemistry, increased 
1.6-fold (p < 0.001) 3-month post-operatively, reaching 96% of the total number of EECs observed in lean con-
trols (Fig. 1A). There was 1.8-fold (p < 0.01) decrease in the number of CCK-containing cells in the duodenum of 
obese compared to lean controls. However, 3 months post-surgery, the number of CCK-expressing EECs in these 
individuals increased 1.5-fold (p < 0.05) (Fig. 1B). A 2.1-fold (p < 0.001) decline in ghrelin-expressing EECs in 
the duodenum of obese patients, in comparison to lean, was fully restored post-operatively (p < 0.001) (Fig. 1C). 
We report here for the first time that human duodenum contains EECs that express PYY, albeit in low numbers. 
In an average of 100 cells counted, PYY-containing EECs were 2.8-fold (p < 0.001) lower in obese compared 
to lean controls but displayed a 1.5-fold (p < 0.05) increase post-operatively (Fig. 3A); however the number of 
PYY-positive cells in the duodenum post-LSG was still 1.8-fold (p < 0.05) lower than lean controls. Furthermore, 
we show some EECs in human duodenum express GLP-1 and GLP-2, although as expected, the number of GLP-1 
and GLP-2 expressing EECs are significantly lower than those expressing CCK or PYY. Duodenal EECs express-
ing GLP-1 and GLP-2 show a 2.5- (p < 0.001) and 2.9-fold (p < 0.001) reduction, respectively, in obese patients 
compared to lean controls. Post-operatively the number of GLP-1 and GLP-2 containing EECs increased 2.1- 
(p < 0.001) and 2.6-fold (p < 0.001), respectively, compared to pre-operative levels (Fig. 3B,C). The findings that 
that the number of duodenal PYY-containing cells in the post-operative obese group was lower than in lean 
controls, contrasts with the number of GLP-positive cells in two groups. This may indicate that in human duode-
num PYY and GLP-1/2 may be expressed in distinct and separate L-cells. The total number of cells counted that 
contain ChA and each respective gut hormone are given in the Supplementary Information (Table S1).
Morphometric analysis of duodenal tissue. 
By morphometric analysis we observed that there were no 
differences in villus height/crypt depth in the duodenal tissues of lean, obese and obese individuals after LSG, 
suggesting that the decline in EEC number is not due to any changes in intestinal surface area (Figure S3). A total 
of ~250 images each for lean, obese pre-op and obese post-op were used.
Expression of intestinal epithelial cell markers in the duodenum. 
In order to determine whether 
the alterations in the number of EECs in the intestine of obese subjects may be observed with other intestinal epi-
thelial cells, we determined the expression levels of defensin 5, a marker of Paneth cells17 and mucin 2 (MUC2), 
an indicator of goblet cells33 (using qPCR and immunohistochemistry) in duodenal tissues of lean and obese indi-
viduals. The protein abundance of Na+/glucose co-transporter 1 (SGLT1), a classical marker of absorptive entero-
cytes, was also assessed (by western blotting). No significant difference in the expression of defensin 5 mRNA was 
detected in the intestine of obese compared to lean (Fig. 4A), but a moderate 1.3-fold (p < 0.01) decline in cells 
expressing defensin 5 protein, measured by immunohistochemistry, was observed in obese compared to lean 
controls (Fig. 4B), and in post-LSG. A marked1.9-fold (p < 0.01) increase in MUC2 mRNA expression (Fig. 4A) 
and a correlated 1.8-fold increase in MUC2 protein abundance (p < 0.001) (Fig. 4B) were seen in the duodenum 
of obese compared to lean controls; this increase was reversed 4-fold (p < 0.001), post-operatively (Fig. 4B). The 
expression of SGLT1 protein was 1.5-fold (p = 0.0114) higher in the intestine of obese compared to lean individ-
uals; and was reversed with a 1.7-fold (p = 0.0262) reduction, post-operatively (Fig. 5A).
Protein abundance of transcription factors. 
The abundance of the transcription factors NeuroD1, 
Ngn3, HATH1 and Hes1 proteins was assessed in duodenal biopsies from lean, obese and obese post-LSG sub-
jects. NeuroD1, Ngn3 and HATH1 protein expression was decreased by 2.5-fold (p = 0.031), 2.7-fold (p = 0.017) 
and 1.6-fold (p = 0.014) respectively, in obese compared to lean individuals. Conversely, Hes1 protein abundance 
was 3.4-fold higher (p = 0.001) in the duodenum of obese individuals compared to lean controls (Fig. 5B–E). The 
observed change in protein abundance of these transcription factors in obese individuals was reversed post-LSG. 
The levels of NeuroD1, Ngn3 and HATH1 were enhanced 2.9-fold (p = 0.012), 2.3-fold (p = 0.012) and 1.5-fold

viduals was reduced by 1.9-fold (p = 0.027) post-LSG, equating to the level detected in the duodenum of healthy

Discussion
Gastrointestinal adaptions and alterations in gut hormone secretion levels appear to be key elements in restoring 
the metabolic improvements seen after bariatric surgery. The two most common and effective procedures are lap-
aroscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). RYGB and LSG produce

enteroendocrine cell marker, chromogranin A (A, ChA) and the gut hormones CCK (B) and ghrelin (C), was 
determined in the duodenal biopsies of lean (■), obese (

immunohistochemistry. Bar charts (on the right) show number of cells counted expressing ChA or gut 
hormones. Statistical significance was determined by a One-way ANOVA with differences between means

markedly different anatomical rearrangements. In RYGB a small gastric pouch is formed and the duodenum 
is bypassed, whilst in LSG a larger portion of the stomach is resected, but the natural passage is unchanged22. 
In spite of these fundamental differences, many clinical and metabolic outcomes (e.g. weight loss, remission 
of co-morbidities such as type-2 diabetes) are relatively similar after both procedures26, 34–36. Different mecha-
nisms have been proposed for explaining the dramatic metabolic improvements. These include calorie restriction, 
changes in the secretion of incretin, gut hormones and blood glucose levels, accelerated gastric emptying and 
alterations in bile acid signalling. In RYGB it has been suggested that accelerated travel of nutrients to the distal 
gut may be a mechanism underlying increased secretion of GLP-1 and PYY32. However this mechanism does not 
entirely explain increased secretion of gut hormones occurring in LSG.
In the present study, we demonstrate a significant increase in EEC numbers after LSG. We show that the 
decrease in the number of EECs in the obese duodenum is also observed in the stomach. The number of cells 
expressing ChA, a marker of EECs, was significantly reduced (45%) in the intestine of obese individuals com-
pared to lean controls. This profile was also reflected in the number of cells expressing gut hormones, both in 
the stomach (ghrelin) and in the duodenum (CCK, GLP-1, ghrelin and PYY). There were no differences in villus 
height/cryptdepth in the duodenal tissues in obese individuals before and after LSG and to that of control lean 
subjects, indicating that the decline in the number of EECs in obesity is not due to any structural changes in the 
intestinal epithelium. It was notable that the population of EECs in obese subjects was increased after LSG, almost 
reaching the cell numbers seen in the intestine of lean controls.
There are a number of recent publications assessing adaptive response of human or rat intestine after RYGB 
or LSG. It is important to note that in LSG, one can directly assess structural and functional changes in the same 
region of the gut (i.e. duodenum) before and after the operation. However, such comparisons cannot be made 
before and after RYGB, as the duodenum is excluded from nutrient exposure and is difficult to access.
Our study is the first to directly compare structural and functional properties of the same region of human 
intestine (duodenum) before and after LSG surgery. Our results relate to the finding of Cavin et al.35 using a 
“LSG rat model”
. They reported that there was no hypertrophy of the jejunal tissue post-surgery, but there was an 
increased number of GLP-1 containing cells35.
Alterations in circulating gut hormone levels in obese versus lean subjects have been published before. It has 
been reported that postprandial release of GLP-1, PYY and CCK is attenuated, with ghrelin concentrations also 
being lower in obese compared to lean subjects10. After both RYGB and LSG, postprandial release of gut hor-
mones GLP-1, PYY and CCK is increased10. The higher number of EECs identified in this study may provide an 
explanation for this increased gut hormone release.
In LSG, the fundus that contains the majority of ghrelin-releasing cells in the stomach, is resected and there-
fore, patients show permanently attenuated ghrelin levels without postprandial decline. Slightly higher ghrelin 
levels observed after 12 months post-operatively compared to 3 months indicate a certain adaption of remaining 
ghrelin-releasing cells21.
Bariatric procedures such as RYGB and LSG are the most effective approaches to resolve type-2 diabetes in 
obese individuals36. This has stimulated research into the role of intestinal glucose absorption in obesity37, 38. The 
intestinal Na+/glucose cotransporter 1, SGLT1, is the major route for the absorption of dietary glucose from 
the lumen of the intestine into absorptive enterocytes15, 39–43. Expression and function of SGLT1 is enhanced 
in the intestine of individuals with type-2 diabetes44 and diabetic or obese rodents45, 46. SGLT1 overexpression

is associated with profound obesity in murine models47 proposing an association between increased intestinal 
glucose transport, diabetes and obesity.
In this study we show that SGLT1 protein abundance is enhanced in the intestine of obese compared to lean 
controls, and the level is returned to normality after LSG. Nguyen et al.48, assessing SGLT1 expression at mRNA 
level, have also reported increased mRNA abundance in the duodenum of obese subjects48. It should be borne 
in mind that assessing expression at both mRNA and protein level will allow determining the cellular level of 
regulation, i.e. transcriptional, post-transcriptional, or translational. However, it is well established that mRNA

expression patterns by themselves are insufficient for the quantitative description of biological systems49. Proteins 
play major roles in the majority of biological processes and measuring protein abundance allows determination 
of functional relevance.
We observed that protein expression of the transcription factor Hes1, required for absorptive enterocyte 
differentiation, was increased (compared to lean) in the obese intestine, and normalised post-LSG, mirroring 
changes in SGLT1 protein abundance.
Our data clearly show that expression levels of the transcription factors HATH1, NeuroD1 and Ngn3, neces-
sary for EEC differentiation, were reduced in obese intestine, in parallel with the number of EECs. However, there 
is no change in the number of Paneth cells (defensin-5 positive cells) and there is an overexpression of goblet cells 
(MUC2-labelled cells). Considering that HATH1 specifies the secretory lineage (enteroendocrine, goblet and 
Paneth cells) our results indicate that there may be alterations in further upstream targets of the HATH1 tran-
scription factor cascade controlling Paneth and goblet cell differentiation in the obese intestine.
Luminal and systemic factors have been implicated in controlling intestinal epithelial cell differentiation. 
There is compelling evidence that intestinal bacteria can regulate the expression of epithelial cell differentiation 
factors such as Hes1, Hath1 and KLF4 both in vivo and in vitro, and that luminal microbiota can directly affect 
epithelial cell differentiation50.

Changes in composition and diversity of gut microbiota have been reported in many pathological conditions 
leading to altered microbial-host interactions resulting in host malfunctions. For example, there are significant 
differences in small bowel microbial populations in inflammatory bowel syndrome (IBS) subjects compared to 
both healthy control and non-IBS individuals51. Reduced gut microbial diversity is also a common finding in 
obesity52 leading to modified microbial-host interactions.
With the availability of methodologies to determine changes in mucosa-attached microbiota53, one can deter-
mine any modifications in duodenal mucosa-attached microbiota before and after surgery. This knowledge will 
allow a better understanding of factors that may be involved in increased secretion of gut hormones post-surgery 
allowing the employment of nutritional and/or therapeutic strategies.

In summary, there is a marked reduction in the number of EECs in the duodenum of morbidly obese patients 
compared to lean controls. LSG surgery results in an increase in the number of EECs to almost normality. We 
infer from these data that the enhancement in EEC numbers could participate in the markedly increased post-
prandial gut hormone secretion observed after LSG. Furthermore, the decreased EEC numbers in the intestine of 
morbidly obese individuals mirrors altered expression of transcription factors controlling epithelial cell differen-
tiation. Deregulation of this regulatory network may lead to defective epithelial differentiation resulting in altered 
functions of the intestinal epithelium.
Our data support the conclusion that there is a deregulation in intestinal epithelial homeostasis in obesity, 
which is restored by LSG leading to normalisation of epithelial cell lineage differentiation.
Experimental Procedures
Patient selection criteria and the surgical procedure. 
The protocol was approved by the State 
Ethics Committee of Basel, Switzerland (EKBB: 298/12) and conducted in accordance with the principles of the 
Declaration of Helsinki. Patients recruited were those scheduled for bariatric surgery. All participants gave writ-
ten informed consent. Exclusion criteria for sleeve gastrectomy patients were: presence of any chronic disease of 
the gastrointestinal tract, and previous gastric surgery. Exclusion criteria for healthy controls were: BMI <18 or 
>30 kg/m2, any chronic illnesses, smoking or substance abuse. Preoperatively study patients followed the stand-
ard evaluation for bariatric patients routinely carried out by St. Claraspital and were assessed by an interdiscipli-
nary team consisting of a surgeon, endocrinologist, nutritionist, and a psychiatrist. The preoperative assessment 
included abdominal ultrasound, upper gastrointestinal x-ray series, gastroscopy and manometry.
The same experienced surgeon successfully completed all procedures laparoscopically. The stomach was dis-
sected by a 6-fold linear stapler beginning 2–4 cm above the pylorus ending at the angle of His over a 35 F bou-
gie. The staple line was over-sewn with an absorbable, monofilament running suture and secured by Lapra-Ty 
(Ethicon Endo-Surgery, USA) clips.
Patients, liquid test meal, and plasma removal (Group 1). 
Fourteen morbidly obese patients 
(Table 1) scheduled for LSG were included in this study. There were no perioperative complications. For meal 
studies, subjects were admitted to the Phase 1 Research Unit of the University Hospital Basel before and 3 months 
after the operation. After fasting overnight (at least 10 hours), an antecubital vein catheter was inserted and a 
fasting sample was taken. Then a liquid test meal with a total calorie content of 408 kcal resp. 1708 KJ (Resource 
diabetes plus 50 g double cream containing 23 g carbohydrates, 15 g proteins and 28 g fat) was served to stimulate 
hormone release. Blood was drawn at the following times: −
15, 0 (corresponding to commencing meal intake), 
15, 30, 45, 60, 120 and 180 min. Samples (10 ml/withdrawal) were collected into EDTA tubes containing aprotinin 
at a final concentration of 500 KIU/ml of blood and a DPP-IV inhibitor; samples were immediately processed and 
kept on ice to avoid peptide breakdown. After centrifugation at 4 °C, plasma samples were kept frozen at −
20 °C 
until analysis.
Hormone analysis. 
The concentrations of cholecystokinin (CCK), glucagon-like-peptide-1 (GLP-1), PYY 
and insulin were measured in blood plasma using commercially available radioimmunoassay or ELISA kits. The 
concentration of glucose in the plasma was measured using a commercially available glucoseoxidase method. For 
further information please see the supplementary methods section.
Gastrointestinal tissue collection (Group 2). 
Thirty-three morbidly obese patients and 24 lean controls 
were included in the study. Three months post-operatively, 27 out of the 33 obese patients were re-examined (see 
Table 2) and tissue biopsies were removed as described in supplementary methods (under gastrointestinal tissue 
collection). Sample processing and analyses were carried out at the University of Liverpool.
Immunohistochemistry. 
Tissue biopsies processed into gelatine-embedded blocks were sectioned at a 
thickness of 10μ
m, and mounted on polysine-coated slides (Polysine TM, Germany) in preparation for immu-
nohistochemistry. For detection of chromogranin A, mouse monoclonal anti-chromogranin A (K2H10) 
antibody (1:300, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) or an affinity-purified goat anti-ChrA (E-20): sc-18232 antibody 
(1:100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) were used. Ghrelin containing cells were identified using 
an affinity-purified polyclonal rabbit antibody to ghrelin (1:100, bs-0467R, Bioss inc, MA, USA). CCK protein 
expression was detected using an affinity purified goat polyclonal CCK (C-20) antibody (1:200, sc-21617, Santa 
Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). PYY expressing cells were identified using an affinity-purified goat pol-
yclonal peptide YY (N-15) antibody (1:200, sc-47318, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). GLP-1 and 
GLP-2 containing cells were identified by affinity-purified goat polyclonal antibodies, GLP-1 (C-17) and GLP-2 
(C-20) (1:100, sc-7782 & sc- 7781, respectively, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Defensin and mucin 
2 were selected as markers of Paneth and goblet cells respectively. Cells expressing defensin and mucin 2 were 
identified by using rabbit monoclonal anti-alpha 5 defensin antibody (EPR14309) (1:3000, Abcam, Cambridge, 
UK) and an affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal anti-Muc2 antibody (1:40, Sigma-Aldrich Company Ltd., Dorset, 
UK). Secondary antibodies were used as appropriate and included FITC-conjugated affinity-purified donkey 
anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG and Cy3- conjugated affinity-purified donkey anti-goat IgG (1:500, Jackson 
ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). The immunostaining was visualised using an epifluorescence 
microscope (Nikon, UK) and images were captured with a Hamamatsu digital camera (C4742-95). Specificity of 
immunostaining was determined by omitting the primary antibody in control sections or by pre-incubating the 
antibody with an excess of appropriate peptide antigens. The quantification of cell numbers in lesser and greater 
curvature of stomach as well as in duodenal biopsies of lean, obese- pre-operative or post-operative patients (for 
ChA, GHR, CCK, PYY, GLP-1, GLP-2 and mucin 2) was performed using a grid (500 ×
 500 µm2), in a defined 
field of view as described54, and cells present on a tissue section of a biopsy within the grid were counted. This

approach prevents bias brought by biopsy size. Between 44–1000 immunopositive cells were counted across 5 sec-
tions per patient (3–4 biopsies per patient). In the case of defensin, immunopositive cell counting was performed 
on an average of 10 crypts from 3 different regions of each 3–4 biopsies for each patient.
RNA isolation and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). 
mRNA abundance was determined using 
cDNA prepared from RNA, isolated from duodenal biopsies. Real-time PCR assays were performed using 
SYBR Green JumpStart Taq ReadyMix for QPCR (Sigma Aldrich). Assays were performed in triplicate using a 
Rotorgene 3000 (Qiagen, Crawley, UK) and relative abundance was calculated using RG-3000 comparative quan-
tification software. Real-time amplification of RNA polymerase IIA (POLR2A) was carried out simultaneously as 
the control reference (see Table S2 for qPCR primer sequences).
Cell lysate isolation. 
Cell lysates were prepared from two biopsies from the same patient using a buffer 
consisting of 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Hepes/Tris pH 7.4, 5 mM EDTA, 1X complete protease cocktail inhibitor 
[11836-148-001, Roche Diagnostics Ltd, Burgess Hill, UK]). The cellular homogenate was centrifuged at 500 ×
 g 
(10 min). The final supernatant containing purified cellular lysates was assayed for protein concentration (average 
lysate volume was 62 ± 11 µl with average protein concentration being 18.6 ± 2.82 µg/µl). The purified cellular 
lysates were mixed with sample buffer (62.5 mM Tris/HCl pH 6.8, 10% [v/v] glycerol, 2% [w/v] SDS, 0.05% [v/v] 
β
-mercaptoethanol, 0.05% [w/v] bromophenol blue), in preparation for western blotting; with aliquots stored at 
−
20 °C until use.
Isolation of brush border membrane vesicles. 
Brush-border membrane vesicles (BBMV) were isolated 
using Mg2+ precipitation/differential centrifugation as previously published39. The final pellet containing BBMV 
were re-suspended in an isotonic buffer (300 mM mannitol, 20 mM Hepes/Tris pH 7.4, 0.1 mM MgSO4) at a vol-
ume of 10 µl. In preparation for western blot analysis, aliquots of freshly prepared BBMV were assayed for protein 
content then diluted with sample buffer (see above) and stored at −
20 °C until use.
Western blotting. 
For the determination of transcription factor protein abundance, protein components 
of lysates (100 µg) were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 12% (w/v) polyacrylamide mini 
gels, containing 0.1% (w/v) SDS, whilst for the determination of SGLT1 protein abundance, protein contents of 
BBMV (20 µg) were separated using 8% (w/v) polyacrylamide mini gels. Membranes were incubated with either 
our custom-made antibody to SGLT140, 41 or with antibodies to Neurogenin 3 (ab38548, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), 
NeuroD1 (ab109224), HATH1 (ab168374) and Hes1 (ab108937). Immunoreactive bands were detected by affinity 
purified horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit secondary antibody (DAKO Ltd, Cambridge, UK) and visual-
ised using Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent HRP Substrate (Millipore, Hertfordshire, UK) and Bio-Max 
Light Chemiluminescence Film (Sigma-Aldrich, Poole, Dorset, UK). The intensity of the immunoreactive bands 
was quantified using scanning densitometry (Total Lab, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK). β
-actin protein abundance 
was used as a loading control.
Morphometry. 
Tissue sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin solutions before dehydration and 
mounting with D.P.X. neutral mounting medium (Sigma-Aldrich). Digital images were captured with an Eclipse 
E400 microscope and DXM 1200 digital camera (Nikon, Kingston upon Thames, Surrey, UK), analysed using 
ImageJ software (Wayne Rasband, US National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) and calibrated using a 100 μ
m 
gradient slide. A minimum of three images were captured per section with a minimum of 8 sections prepared per 
individual, with each section being 5 sections apart within the block. All images were captured under the same 
conditions. The villus height and the crypt depth measurements were determined blindly taken from an average 
of sixteen well oriented crypt-villus units per patient.
Statistics. 
All parameters were tested for normality by the Shapiro–Wilk test. Descriptive statistics were used 
for demographic variables such as age, weight, height, and BMI. Hormone profiles were calculated using pharma-
codynamic parameters (area under the concentration–time curve (AUC) and maximum plasma concentration 
(Cmax)). Pre- and post-operative AUC and Cmax of the hormone profiles were compared using Student’s paired 
t-test values. A one-way ANOVA with either a Tukey’s or Holm-Sidak multiple comparison post-test was used 
to determine the significance of gut hormone, markers of various intestinal epithelial cells and transcription fac-
tor abundance. All statistical analyses were carried out using the statistical software package SPSS for Windows 
Version 19.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA) or Graphpad Prism for Windows Version 6.0 (Graphpad Inc., CA, USA). 
Values were reported as mean ± SEM, with p ≤
 0.05 considered as statistically significant.
