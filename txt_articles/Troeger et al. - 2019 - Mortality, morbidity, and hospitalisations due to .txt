Mortality, morbidity, and hospitalisations due to influenza 
lower respiratory tract infections, 2017: an analysis for the 
Global Burden of Disease Study 2017
GBD 2017 Influenza Collaborators* 
Summary
Background Although the burden of influenza is often discussed in the context of historical pandemics and the threat 
of future pandemics, every year a substantial burden of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) and other respiratory 
conditions (like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) are attributable to seasonal influenza. The Global Burden of 
Disease Study (GBD) 2017 is a systematic scientific effort to quantify the health loss associated with a comprehensive 
set of diseases and disabilities. In this Article, we focus on LRTIs that can be attributed to influenza.
Methods We modelled the LRTI incidence, hospitalisations, and mortality attributable to influenza for every country 
and selected subnational locations by age and year from 1990 to 2017 as part of GBD 2017. We used a counterfactual 
approach that first estimated the LRTI incidence, hospitalisations, and mortality and then attributed a fraction of 
those outcomes to influenza.
Findings Influenza LRTI was responsible for an estimated 145 000 (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 99 000–200 000) 
deaths among all ages in 2017. The influenza LRTI mortality rate was highest among adults older than 70 years 
(16·4 deaths per 100 000 [95% UI 11·6–21·9]), and the highest rate among all ages was in eastern Europe (5·2 per 
100 000 population [95% UI 3·5–7·2]). We estimated that influenza LRTIs accounted for 9 459 000 (95% UI 
3 709 000–22 935 000) hospitalisations due to LRTIs and 81 536 000 hospital days (24 330 000–259 851 000). We 
estimated that 11·5% (95% UI 10·0–12·9) of LRTI episodes were attributable to influenza, corresponding to 54 481 000 
(38 465 000–73 864 000) episodes and 8 172 000 severe episodes (5 000 000–13 296 000).
Interpretation This comprehensive assessment of the burden of influenza LRTIs shows the substantial annual effect 
of influenza on global health. Although preparedness planning will be important for potential pandemics, health loss 
due to seasonal influenza LRTIs should not be overlooked, and vaccine use should be considered. Efforts to improve 
influenza prevention measures are needed.

Introduction
In 1918, an influenza pandemic killed an estimated 
20–50 million people,1–3 more than the number that died 
in World War 1. Today, seasonal influenza remains a 
substantial contributor to the growing number of cases 
of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) worldwide.4 
Research is underway to clarify the pandemic potential of 
influenza.5–7 Such efforts have focused on understanding 
the risk factors predictive of pandemic potential, 
modelling disease transmission to inform preparedness,6 
and ident 
ify 
ing strategies to interrupt or mitigate 
pandemics.8 However, the sum of seasonal influenza 
deaths in the past 100 years is likely to exceed deaths due 
to influenza pandemics, and seasonal influenza is 
responsible for substantial mortality, disability, and 
economic disruption. Appropriate efforts to decrease this 
burden require timely and reliable estimates of the full 
spectrum of disease.
The construction of a pyramid of influenza disease 
burden would include metrics describing the spectrum of 
disease, including the incidence of moderate and severe 
LRTIs, hospitalisations, and deaths (figure 1). By contrast, 
a transmission pyramid could also include asymptomatic 
infections, which, by definition, do not have a disease 
burden but might be crucial to the understanding of 
influenza transmission dynamics. This conceptualisation 
could enable public health officials, health-care providers, 
and policy makers to use available data to focus on any 
point of the pyramid and develop a comprehensive sense 
of influenza burden. The burden of influenza LRTI is 
difficult to quantify for various reasons related to diagnosis 
of LRTIs, detection of influenza, and data availability in 
many setting. Furthermore, there is a dearth of information 
available about the burden of influenza as an aetiology of 
LRTIs,9 and a full perspective of the health loss associated 
with influenza LRTIs at the population level is important 
to understand the burden and develop surveillance and 
intervention programmes.

and comparable estimates of the burden of disease across 
causes of death and disability. In this Article, we seek to 
quantify the burden of influenza LRTIs by using a 
counterfactual approach to estimate LRTIs caused by 
influenza and build on previous descriptions of LRTIs in 
the GBD.4,10 LRTIs are the leading cause of infectious 
disease mortality worldwide, and cause more deaths 
than tuberculosis and HIV combined. In 2016, they were 
responsible for more than 2 500 000 deaths and were the 
fifth-leading incident infectious disease globally.4 Within 
the GBD framework, influenza is considered a causal 
aetiology only for LRTIs and it is estimated as a subset of 
the overall LRTI burden. In this Article, we describe the 
global incidence of influenza LRTIs, rates of hospital-
isation associated with influenza LRTIs, and the number 
of deaths due to influenza LRTIs across time, geograph-
ical regions and age groups.
Methods
Summary
The GBD quantifies four pathogens as causative 
aetiologies of LRTI, namely the influenza virus, 
respiratory syncytial virus, Haemophilus influenzae type b, 
and Streptococcus pneumoniae. These four pathogens 
were identified on the basis of expert opinion. A 
comprehensive description of LRTI modelling, including 
mortality and morbidity methods for all-cause LRTI, has 
been described elsewhere,4 and so here we focus on 
specific methods for influenza attribution in GBD 2017
.4 
Estimation of LRTIs attributable to influenza has two 
main components. First, we estimated the counterfactual 
attributable fraction of LRTIs that were due to influenza 
on the basis of modelled estimates produced by a 
Bayesian predictive model by age, sex, year, and 
geography. Second, we estimated the number of deaths 
and hospitalisations due to LRTIs and episodes of LRTIs 
by age, sex, year, and geography with Bayesian predictive 
models. The product of the LRTI mortality, episodes, and 
hospitalisations and the influenza attributable fraction 
was the estimated burden of influenza in this study. This 
study complies with the Guidelines for Accurate and 
Transparent Health Estimates Reporting (GATHER) 
statement.11 
Research in context
Evidence before the study
The burden of influenza has frequently been described in 
geographical or age-specific subpopulations, and several 
studies have focused on pandemic H1N1 or syndromic 
definitions of influenza, such as influenza-like illness. Several 
studies have sought to describe mortality and morbidity 
associated with influenza, including a publication led by the 
US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and WHO that 
estimated 298 000–646 000 seasonal influenza-associated 
respiratory deaths globally in 2015. Previous iterations of the 
Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) reported mortality from 
influenza-attributable lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) 
globally, with an estimated 58 000 deaths (95% uncertainty 
interval 44 000–74 000) in 2016. An analysis to produce a 
comprehensive description of influenza LRTIs that covers the 
full range of the disease by age group and geographical region, 
and over time, has not previously been done.
Added value of this study
We estimated the influenza-attributable burden of LRTIs, 
including estimates of incidence, hospitalisation, and deaths for 
every country globally, for both sexes, and for all ages, for 2017. To 
the best of our knowledge, no other study has produced estimates 
for such specific demographic categories. We leveraged the 
statistical methods developed for the GBD to produce internally 
consistent estimates of LRTI morbidity and mortality, and applied 
a counterfactual strategy to establish the fraction of LRTI burden 
that was directly caused by influenza. The strength of these 
methods is that our results are interpretable as a preventable 
burden if influenza transmission were reduced or eliminated. Such 
findings provide detailed evidence about where influenza LRTI 
burden is greatest by age and geography, and about the potential 
health effects of efforts to reduce influenza transmission.
Implications of all the available evidence
Our estimates of influenza LRTI suggest that the burden is not 
uniform across regions or by age, and that locations and age 
groups with the highest underlying rate of LRTI have the highest 
influenza LRTI burden. We suggest that interventions that affect 
influenza transmission, such as vaccination, should be combined 
with interventions that reduce LRTI risk, such as improvement 
of air quality, to reduce the overall burden of influenza LRTI.

This diagram shows the spectrum of influenza LRTI. We presents estimates of 
moderate and severe influenza LRTIs (of which some fraction [modelled 
independently] is hospitalised), and mortality due to influenza LRTI. We did not 
estimate inapparent infection, which could be important for understanding the 
transmission dynamics of influenza LRTIs but does not account for a measurable 
burden of disease. LRTI=lower respiratory tract infection.

Procedures
We used a counterfactual definition for influenza. LRTIs 
were defined as clinician-diagnosed pneumonia or 
bronchiolitis (appendix p 1).4 There is evidence of a causal 
association between influenza and LRTIs among children 
younger than 5 years when the influenza virus is detected 
by reverse transcriptase (RT) PCR of respiratory samples.12 
On the basis of these data, we estimated the population 
attributable fraction (PAF) of LRTI episodes, deaths, and 
hospitalisations that were caused by influenza in all age 
groups. This approach was a counterfactual analysis to 
establish the contribution of influenza to LRTIs. In this 
analysis, the counterfactual estimated was the burden of 
LRTI that would exist in the absence of influenza—or, in 
other words, the burden of LRTI causally attributable to 
influenza. The attribution was based on the exposure and 
the risk of the outcome.
Data for influenza were obtained through a systematic 
review4 of scientific literature for the proportion of LRTIs 
that tested positive by PCR or ELISA for influenza, from 
studies published between Jan 1, 1990, and May 26, 2017
. 
We excluded studies that focused only on 2009 pandemic 
H1N1 influenza and studies in which influenza-like 
illness was the outcome definition. Our final dataset 
included all data used in GBD 2016 in addition to those 
identified in our updated systematic review. The search 
string is provided in the appendix (p 3). We included 
studies that had a sample size of at least 100 people (to 
avoid potential biases associated with small denom 
inators, 
and consistent with other aetiologies in GBD 2017), were 
at least 1 year in duration (to limit seasonal detection bias), 
and used a case definition of LRTI, pneumonia, or 
bronchiolitis. During our updated systematic review, we 
identified 595 studies, 75 of which met our inclusion 
criteria and were extracted. These 75 studies were added to 
the 153 data sources that were used in GBD 2016 and 
extracted according to the same inclusion and exclusion 
criteria. We did not include surveillance or administrative 
data because they do not typically include the proportion 
of LRTIs positive for influenza and because they are prone 
to reporting and testing biases.
Specifically, we sought to model the frequency of 
detection of influenza in LRTI episodes on the basis of 
an RT-PCR reference case definition. The frequency of 
detection was a modelled value with variation in age, sex, 
year, and geography from our model and was based on 
the distributions of the input data. In this model, we 
estimated the relative frequency of detection in 
hospitalised compared with non-hospitalised populations 
and assumed that this value was a proxy for fatal LRTI 
episodes. By contrast with a categorical approach, which 
would stop at this point, the counterfactual approach 
required quantifi 
cation of the relative risk of LRTI in 
view of evidence of influenza in the nasopharynx or 
oropharynx, for which we used odds ratios (ORs) from a 
systematic review and meta-analysis of studies of 
children younger than 5 years.12 In the absence of 
available and reliable results in older children and adults, 
we assumed that this association was constant across age 
groups.
Statistical analysis
We estimated three related PAFs for non-mutually 
exclusive influenza LRTI categories: a non-fatal PAF, a 
hospitalisation PAF, and a fatal PAF (appendix p 4). The 
non-fatal PAF (appendix p 4) was the simplest.
Frequency was the modelled proportion of LRTI episodes 
that test positive for influenza by PCR, which varied by 
age, sex, year, and geography, and OR was the odds of an 
LRTI episode in view of the presence of influenza in a 
respiratory tract sample (5·10 [95% CI 3·19–8·14]).12 To 
account for the previously described frequency of influenza 
detection in hospitalised compared with non-hospitalised 
LRTI episodes, using the equation for non-fatal PAF, we 
applied a constant scalar (ie, a hospital scalar) to establish 
the PAF for LRTI hospitalisations. This PAF was calculated 
by comparing the mean frequency of influenza detection 
in hospitalised sample populations with that in non-
hospitalised sample populations in the proportion data 
from our literature review.
Finally, to account for the relative difference in the 
risk of mortality between bacterial and viral causes of 
LRTIs, using the equation for hospitalisation PAF, we 
applied a fatality scalar. We modelled the ratio of case 
fatality of viral-to-bacterial International Classification 
of Diseases-coded hospital admissions (appendix p 23) 
to calculate the fatality scalar, which was applied to 
establish the attribution of influenza for fatal LRTI 
outcomes. Hospital data from high-income and low-
income countries were used in this analysis, and we 
estimated an age-specific curve for this relationship 
(appendix p 24).
The final number of LRTI episodes, deaths, and 
hospitalisations attributable to influenza was the product 
of the relevant PAF and the overall number of episodes, 
deaths, and hospitalisations for each country, year, age, 
and sex.
LRTI episodes, deaths, and hospitalisations were 
modelled independently of influenza attributable 
fractions. The mortality due to LRTIs was modelled 
with a Bayesian predictive ensemble modelling tool 
developed for the GBD called the Cause of Death 
Ensemble model (CODEm) which has been described 
in detail previously (appendix pp 1–2).13,14 Briefly, 
CODEm uses a covariate selection algorithm to produce 
a wide array of sub-models, which are assessed on the 
basis of their out-of-sample predictive validity. The best-
performing models then contribute relatively more to a 
final ensemble model of LRTI mortality. The input data

for this model were vital registration data, verbal autopsy 
studies, and surveillance system records. The predictive 
validity of this model was assessed with out-of-sample 
statistics, and we judged the best-performing model to 
be the one with the best out-of-sample values for 
statistical fit.
The incidence of all LRTI episodes was modelled with a 
Bayesian meta-regression tool developed for the GBD

called DisMod-MR 2.1 (appendix p 3).15 DisMod-MR 2.1 was 
designed to incorporate all available epidemiological data, 
to standardise these data so that they are comparable, and 
to develop estimates of disease burden by age, sex, year, and 
geography. Data for this model primarily came from 
population-representative surveys, inpatient and outpatient 
health-care utilisation records, and scientific literature. 
LRTIs in GBD are defined as either moderate or severe, 
and the proportion of severe LRTI episodes was established 
by a meta-analysis of the incidence of severe LRTIs—
defined as infections that required inpatient admission or 
oxygen therapy, or that met the WHO Integrated 
Management of Childhood Infections definition (appendix 
p 3) of severe pneumonia—versus non-severe LRTIs in 
studies in which the incidence of both was reported.4 
Modelling of severe influenza LRTIs and hospitalised 
influenza LRTIs was not done with the same data, and so 
were not independent from each other in this analysis.
The incidence of LRTI hospitalisations was also 
modelled with DisMod-MR 2.1. For this model, only 
inpatient utilisation data were included. These data were 
primarily from high-income countries such as the USA

India, Indonesia, Kenya, Mexico, Nepal, the Philippines, 
Qatar, and Vietnam were also included (appendix 
pp 24–25). Covariates such as the total inpatient visits 
per person and the Healthcare Access and Quality 
Index16 were used to help account for variations in 
health-care availability and access. The duration in days

sation for viral LRTI episodes was based on a 
meta-analysis of studies in which this duration was 
reported.4
All modelled estimates for the GBD, including 
influenza attributable fractions, influenza LRTI inci-
dence, hospitalisations, and deaths, were estimated for 
195 countries and territories by sex and age group, from 
1990 to 2017
. The results presented are the mean values 
from a distribution of 1000 estimated observations 
(draws) for each modelled value or input parameter.

Results
We estimated that 5·6% (95% UI 4·3–7·1) of global LRTI 
deaths were attributable to influenza in 2017, which 
corresponded to 145 000 (98 000–200 000) deaths across all 
ages (table). Deaths attributable to influenza accounted 
for 0·26% (95% UI 0·2–0·32) of all deaths in 2017
. The 
PAF was greater among adults older than 70 years (6·3% 
[95% UI 4·8–7·8) than among children younger than 
5 years (2·9% [2·0–4·0]; figure 2; appendix p 28). The 
fraction of LRTI deaths that were attributable to influenza 
ranged from 1·9% (95% UI 1·6–2·2) in Mozambique to 
23·7% (19·1–27·6) in Ukraine (appendix p 28). Most 
influenza LRTI deaths occurred among elderly people, 
with 71 000 deaths (95% UI 50 000–95 000) among adults 
older than 70 years (figure 2). Mortality rate was also 
highest in this age group (16·4 deaths per 100 000 [95% UI 
11·6–21·9]). Among all ages, when looking at regional 
estimates, the highest estimated influenza LRTI mortality 
rates occurred in the Caribbean (5·5 per 100 000 [95% UI 
3·6–7·7]) and eastern Europe (5·2 per 100 000 [3·5–7·2]) 
regions, and the highest mortality rate overall was in 
Taiwan (province of China; 12·1 per 100 000 [7·8–17·6]; 
figure 3; table). The estimated influenza LRTI mortality 
rate was lowest in the Australasia region (0·9 per 100 000 
[95% UI 0·5–1·3), and Qatar was the country with the 
lowest rate (0·2 per 100 000 [0·1–0·4]; figure 3; table).

Nearly a third of all influenza LRTI deaths occurred in 
India (26 000 [95% UI 16 000–37 000]), China (11 000 
[7000–16 000]), and Russia (8000 [5000–11 000]; table). 
Between 1990 and 2017, the influenza LRTI mortality rate 
decreased by 29·5% among all ages (from 2·7 per 100 000 
to 1·9 per 100 000). The rate of decline in this period was 
fastest among children younger than 5 years (67·8%) and 
slowest among adults older than 70 years (10·2%; data 
not shown).
Influenza was more frequently associated with non-fatal 
or non-severe LRTI episodes than with fatal or severe 
episodes. We estimated that influenza was present 23% 
(95% UI 9–33) less frequently in hospitalised LRTI cases 
than in non-hospitalised LRTI episodes. This finding 
was also shown by the proportionally greater attribution 
of influenza to non-fatal LRTI than to fatal LRTI (figure 2). 
Among all ages, an estimated 8·5% (95% UI 5·4–13·5) 
of LRTI hospitalisations were attributable to influenza 
(figure 2). We estimated that influenza was responsible 
for 9 459 000 (95% UI 3 709 000–22 935 000) LRTI hospital-
isations —a rate of 123·8 per 100 000 (95% UI 48·5–300·2; 
table) in 2017—corresponding to an estimated 81 536 000 
(95% UI 24 330 000–259 851 000) hospital days due to 
influenza LRTI. The greatest number of influenza LRTI 
episodes and hospitalisations occurred among children 
younger than 10 years (figure 2). We estimated that there 
were 2 224 000 (95% UI 738 000–5 979 000) LRTI hospital-
isations due to influenza among children younger than 
5 years in 2017
. The incidences of non-hospitalised and 
hospitalised influenza LRTIs were high in children and 
elderly people, resulting in a U-shaped curve when 
graphed (figure 2). The incidence per 100 000 population of 
hospitalisation due to influenza LRTI was greatest in 
eastern Europe (488·7 [95% UI 185·9–1204·6]) and central 
Asia (303·1 [120·5–721·6]; figure 4; table). The countries 
with the highest estimated rates of influenza LRTI 
hospitalisation per 100 000 population were Lithuania 
(560·7 [227·2–1351·7]) and Russia (494·4 [183·6–1241·6]), 
whereas 
Nepal 
(9·4 
[3·2–25·7]) 
and 
Bangladesh 
(11·9 [3·7–33·8]) had the lowest rates per 100 000 (figure 4; 
table). Globally in 2017, 17·4% (95% UI 9·6–31·0) of 
influenza LRTI cases were hospitalised among all ages 
(appendix pp 28–29). The proportion hospitalised was 
highest in adults older than 70 years (appendix p 29). 
Indonesia (1·2% [0·6–2·3]) and the Maldives (1·3% 
[0·6–2·6]) had the lowest estimated proportions of 
influenza LRTI episodes that were hospitalised, whereas 
Singapore (59·0% [31·8–100·0]) and Brunei (59·1% 
[29·6–100·0]) had the highest proportions (appendix p 28). 
Although the number of influenza LRTI hospitalisations 
increased by 14·0% between 1990 and 2017 (from 
8 300 000 to 9 459 000), the hospitalisation rate declined

over the same period by 19·6% (from 153·9 per 100 000 to 
123·8 per 100 000; data not shown).
Among all ages, we estimated that 11·5% (95% UI 
10·0–12·9) of LRTI episodes were attributable to 
influenza (figure 2). This attributable fraction was 
highest among people aged 30–54 years (figure 2). 9·2% 
(95% UI 8·0–10·2) of LRTI episodes among children 
younger than 5 years and 10·8% (9·3–12·0%) among 
adults older than 70 years were attributable to influenza 
(figure 2). We estimated that influenza was responsible 
for 54 481 000 (95% UI 38 465 000–73 864 000) LRTI 
episodes among all ages in 2017 (table), including 
8 172 000 (5 000 000–13 296 000) severe LRTI episodes. 
Influenza episodes were most common in eastern 
Europe (2399·3 episodes per 100 000 [95% UI 
1717·2–3205·6]) and southeast Asia (1591·2 per 100 000 
[1118·1–2160·2]; figure 5; table). The highest overall 
incidences per 100 000 population were in Vietnam 
(3710·5 [95% UI 2537·3–5141·6]) and Lithuania (2489·6 
[1728·2–3469·3]), whereas the lowest inci 
dences were in 
Italy (63·4 [44·5–85·1]) and Israel (83·2 [57·3–117·2]; 
table). The incidence of influenza LRTIs decreased by 
9·7% between 1990 and 2017 (from 789·9 per 100 000 to 
713·1 per 100 000), but increased in young adults aged 
15–49 years by 12·1% (from 566·1 per 100 000 to 634·6 
per 100 000; data not shown).
Discussion
In this Article, we provide the most thorough and 
comprehensive analysis of the burden of LRTIs 
attributable to influenza so far. We provide estimates of 
the incidence, incidence of severe disease, hospitalisations, 
and mortality for each age group and by geographical 
region for 2017
. We estimated that there were 54 481 000 
(95% UI 38 465 000–73 864 000) LRTI episodes attributable 
to influenza, 8 172 000 (5 000 000–13 296 000) of which 
were severe, that caused 145 000 (99 000–200 000) deaths 
and 9 459 000 (3 709 000–22 935 000) hospitalisations.
A full picture of LRTIs and upper respiratory infections 
(including the non-respiratory infections), including 
symptomatic and inapparent infections, hospitalisations, 
and deaths, is necessary to quantify the entire spectrum of 
influenza illness (figure 1). This study has captured many, 
but not all those components. Inclusion of inapparent 
or asymptomatic influenza virus infection is crucial to 
model the transmission of influenza spread. The GBD 
does not typically estimate asymptomatic infections for 
causes of disease. There is evidence that influenza virus 
infection could be a risk factor for cardiovascular 
mortality,17 renal failure, and other systemic outcomes, 
perhaps through exacerbation of underlying or comorbid 
diseases. These systemic outcomes could begin with a 
respiratory infection and might be captured in time-series

analyses of influenza burden or through influenza vaccine 
probe studies with severe illness endpoints to measure 
vaccine-preventable disease incidence.18 Our study 
quantified the remaining aspects of influenza disease 
burden, by focusing exclusively on LRTIs attributable to 
influenza. We have shown that a moderate amount of 
LRTIs are attributable to influenza. The attributable 
fraction is highest in adolescents and adults, but because 
of the greater overall risk of LRTIs in young children and 
elderly adults, our results suggest that the greatest number 
of LRTI episodes, deaths, and hospitalisations occur in 
young children and elderly adults.
Age patterns in rates and counts should be considered 
when developing appropriate responses and inter-
ventions. Global estimates of coverage of the seasonal 
influenza vaccine, which could provide additional 
evidence of disease burden, were not available for this 
study. Although we did not account for influenza vaccine 
coverage, our results help to point to where a seasonal or 
universal influenza vaccine would have the greatest 
effect. Modelling studies have suggested that vaccination 
of targeted populations could reduce seasonal influenza 
outbreaks,19 and could help to prevent episodes and 
hospitalisations in elderly adults.20 Our results suggest 
that the potential effect of vaccination on the burden of 
influenza LRTIs—ie, reductions in severe episodes, non-
severe episodes, and deaths—might vary, and that 
targeting  of specific age groups, particularly elderly 
people, and regions such as eastern Europe and southeast 
Asia could substantially reduce the global burden of 
influenza LRTIs. The counterfactual strategy used in our 
model allows for quantification of the avertable burden 
through vaccin 
ation or other interventions.
To estimate the attributable fraction of LRTI that was 
due to influenza, we made several important analytic 
decisions and assumptions. Our analysis of available data 
that reflected the frequency of influenza isolation among 
respiratory samples from pneumonia or bronchiolitis 
episodes (ie, the definition of LRTI in GBD 2017) showed 
that RT-PCR is significantly more sensitive than ELISA-
based methods for detection of acute influenza infection. 
The mean frequency of influenza-positive samples was 
about 25% greater with RT-PCR than with non-RT-PCR 
diagnostics (appendix p 5), a result that is consistent with 
the general body of knowledge about molecular diagnostic 
methods.21 Another systematic review22 of influenza 
detection among acute LRTI episodes in children showed 
that PCR diagnostics detected influenza more than twice 
as frequently as immunofluorescence tests. One of the 
explanations for this finding could be the anatomical site 
where samples were collected, which can affect the 
frequency of influenza detection. Nasopharyngeal swabs 
were used in more studies because samples are easy to 
collect and the process is non-invasive.23 The data included 
in our systematic review were nearly exclusively based on 
nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs. Studies have 
shown varying levels of specificity and sensitivity for the 
relationship between detection based on nasopharyngeal 
samples and LRTIs.23,24 The time between infection and 
onset of symptoms, geographical regions, and sample 
collection could also have crucial roles in influenza virus 
detection with or without molecular diagnostics.
Our aetiological attribution for influenza is based on 
approximately 650 data points from 100 sources in 
40 countries (appendix pp 6–24). The predictive modelling 
tools used in the GBD are based on space-time 
information and covariates to help to make estimates for 
every geographical region, year, and age. In areas with 
sparse data, uncertainty around the estimates is greater 
than that in areas with many data. The modelled 
frequency of influenza attributable LRTI episodes is a 
component of the counterfactual attribution strategy used 
in GBD 2017
. The second component of the PAF model, 
the OR, reflects how likely a sample that tests positive for 
influenza is to identify the aetiology of LRTI. The source 
that we used to quantify this relationship was a systematic 
review12 of studies of children younger than 5 years. 
Because of the absence of data for this relationship in 
older age groups, we assumed that the relationship was 
constant across ages—an assumption that might not hold 
because of immuno 
logical or biological differences 
between young children and adults. If adults are more 
likely than children younger than 5 years to have an LRTI 
episode if influenza is detected, our estimates in adults 
might be an under 
estimate. Conversely if adults are less 
likely to have an LRTI episode if influenza is detected 
than are children under 5, our results might be an over-
estimate. A study25 in South Africa showed that the odds 
of severe acute respiratory illness if influenza was present 
was lower among 5–64-year-olds than among people 
younger than 5 years or older than 65 years. Although 
those results come from only one study with a different 
case definition from what we used, they suggest that we 
might have over 
estimated the influenza attribution in 
people aged 5–64 years.
There is evidence of a potentially important role in 
influenza 
for 
co-infection 
with 
S 
pneumoniae, 
Staphylococcus aureus, H influenzae type b, and other 
bacterial pneumonias.26–28 The interpretation of the 
counterfactual attribution used in the GBD, although 
estimated independently for each pathogen, allows for 
overlap in the attribution of LRTI episodes or deaths 
due to multiple pathogens. However, our estimation 
does not explicitly account for influenza infection as a 
risk factor for subsequent bacterial infections, which is a 
potentially important burden.
The GBD 2017 estimates of LRTI deaths attributable to 
influenza are about two times greater than the estimates 
from GBD 2016 (appendix pp 31–33). This change is largely 
because of an important adjustment scalar in calculating 
how frequently viral causes of LRTI are associated with 
mortality compared with bacterial causes of LRTI. Our 
analysis showed that bacterial aetiologies are more likely to 
lead to death than viral aetiologies.4 For previous GBD

85
studies, this relationship was quantified on the basis of data 
from a small subset of countries. We reproduced this 
analysis for GBD 2017 with a much larger dataset of 
hospitalisation records that were coded specifically to viral 
or bacterial causes of LRTI and for which the outcome—
discharge or death—was known. The International 
Classification of Diseases codes used in this step were 
unlikely to capture any interaction between influenza and 
bacterial aetiologies of LRTI and the risk of death in people 
with viral–bacterial co-infections is probably higher than 
that in people with viral infections alone.29 This reanalysis 
substantially reduced the uncertainty around this adjust-
ment and reduced the magnitude of the scalar used to 
adjust the fatal influenza attributable fraction (p 30).
The number of LRTI deaths attributable to influenza 
that we calculated was much lower than that in the 2018 
report30 from Iuliano and colleagues, who estimated 
290 000–650 000 seasonal influenza-associated respiratory 
deaths. Differences in the modelling strategy used account 
for a large amount of the variation in the estimates and 
have been explored as part of a modelling workshop 
between these research groups. Whereas Iuliano and 
colleagues’ approach was designed to estimate any deaths 
that could be considered associated with influenza, our 
approach was designed to estimate the proportion of LRTI 
deaths that were attributable to (ie, caused by) influenza in 
our counterfactual framework. The GBD 2017 estimation 
strategy starts with an overall number of LRTI deaths and 
counterfactually attributes a fraction of these deaths to 
influenza. By contrast, Iuliano and colleagues used a time-
series analysis to identify excess mortality among all 
respiratory-coded deaths (10th edition of the International 
Classification of Diseases codes J00–J99) during the 
influenza season and used these estimates to model 
annual influenza-associated respiratory deaths. Although 
their strategy allows for variation in burden by year and 
season, our approach was robust to influenza occurrence, 
association with LRTI episodes, and consistency between 
other causes of death, and estimates that were produced 
for every year, age, sex, and geographical region. Our 
approach has the major advantage of quantifying the 
potentially avertable influenza burden, and our results can 
be used to estimate the vaccine preventable burden and 
the burden preventable by other interventions.
Lafond and colleagues22 estimated the global frequency of 
paediatric influenza-associated hospitalisations. They used 
a similar approach to ours: starting with a systematic review 
of the proportion of respiratory infections positive for 
influenza among children younger than 18 years that 
resulted in hospitalisation, they then calculated the product 
of that proportion and the number of acute LRTI 
hospitalisation in 2010, and estimated that there were 
870 000 (95% CI 610 000–1 237 000) influenza-associated 
hospital 
isations among children younger than 5 years.22 
This estimate is lower than ours (2 224 000 [95% UI 
738 000–5 979 000]) but our estimates of the fraction of 
hospitalised LRTIs that are due to influenza are nearly 
identical (7·4%22 vs 6·9% in our study), which suggests that 
the main difference is in the overall estimates of LRTI 
hospitalisations among children younger than 5 years. 
Indeed, our estimate of LRTI hospitalisations of 32 211 000 
(95% UI 18 073 000–52 112 000) is much larger than that 
used by Lafond and colleagues (11 751 000).22,31 This example 
shows the effect of multiple estimated values in both 
studies and that rates of hospitalisations depend on not 
only the attributable fraction of LRTI due to influenza but 
also the overall availability and use of health care.
Our study had several limitations. The availability and 
quality of data are very important in any predictive 
regression model. There is a scarcity of data in several 
geographical regions, such as south Asia and sub-Saharan 
Africa for several of our models, particularly the models 
for LRTI mortality and hospitalisation. By contrast, there 
was good data coverage for LRTI incidence globally 
because of population representative surveys. The data 
that informed the attributable fraction of influenza were 
also sparse in some parts of the world, such as central 
Europe and central Asia. Strengthening of the capacity for 
detection of influenza has become a priority among global 
health organisations, largely with the aim of improving 
early detection systems, but expansion of routine 
surveillance could also help to improve global burden 
estimates.32 Our systematic review identified several 
reports from central-latitude locations in which influenza 
accounted for a substantial proportion of LRTI episodes.33 
This finding suggests that influenza could be an important 
cause of LRTIs in tropical climates,34 an area of some 
debate centred on whether environmental suitability is 
necessary for seasonal influenza burden.
As mentioned previously, because of an absence of 
data, we assumed that the presence of influenza in a 
respiratory sample has the same risk of contributing to 
an LRTI episode among children younger than 5 years as 
among older children and adults. This assumption could 
be inaccurate when taking into account various immuno-
logical and biological factors, and circulating influenza 
strains. Changes in circulating influenza virus strains 
over time and space have been studied extensively to 
predict strains for seasonal vaccine development and for 
assessments of the risk of a pandemic.35 Our study 
attempted to combine all strains of influenza into a 
single burden estimate, and stratification by subtype, 
including influenza A, B, and pandemic H1N1, might 
reveal additional trends in influenza burden. However, 
the influenza burden has the potential to change 
substantially from year to year and from season to 
season.36 We deliberately chose to include only studies 
that were done over a full year to avoid biasing our 
estimates with data from studies done during the peak 
influenza season. We also chose to exclude studies that 
tested for pandemic H1N1 exclusively because we 
thought this would bias our estimates, but included 
studies that tested for H1N1 concurrently with seasonal 
influenza. These decisions contributed to stability over

time in our estimates of the attributable fraction of 
influenza. Although our model probably failed to capture 
significant year-to-year variation in influenza burden, the 
purpose of this modelling approach was to minimise the 
effect of such variation in calculation of the attributable 
burden of influenza LRTI.
Although much of the public attention on influenza has 
centred around the global threat of a pandemic, and has 
rightly emphasised the potential effects of the virus in an 
increasingly interconnected global community, our results 
show that seasonal influenza contributes to a substantial 
burden of LRTIs. The best way to prevent influenza-
specific LRTIs is vaccination or targeted prophylaxis, and 
we have previously showed that re 
duction of exposure to 
air pollution and tobacco smoke could have major effects 
on the risk of all LRTIs.4 The highest burden of influenza 
LRTIs is in low-income and middle-income countries, 
and thus additional data about influenza epidemiology in 
those countries are needed to guide decisions about the 
development of vaccines and appropriate vaccination 
strategies to prevent severe influenza illnesses.37 Efforts to 
develop improved influenza vaccines that could avert a 
large annual burden of LRTI episodes, deaths, and 
hospitalisations are needed.38,39 A full understanding of the 
burden of seasonal influenza could contribute to improved 
understanding of the epidemiology of the virus and 
preparedness in case of another influenza pandemic.
