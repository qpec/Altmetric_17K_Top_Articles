Thiazolidinediones and Advanced Liver Fibrosis
in Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis
A Meta-analysis
Giovanni Musso, MD; Maurizio Cassader, PhD; Elena Paschetta, MD; Roberto Gambino, PhD
IMPORTANCE Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is projected to be the leading cause of
liver transplantation by 2020. Advanced fibrosis (stage F3-F4) on liver biopsy independently
predicts all-cause and liver-related mortality in NASH. There are no known efficacious
treatments for advanced fibrosis related to NASH. Thiazolidinedione therapy has been
extensively evaluated in NASH, and new randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of its efficacy have
been completed.
OBJECTIVE To synthesize the evidence about the association of thiazolidinedione therapy
with advanced liver fibrosis in NASH.
DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process, Cochrane Library, EMBASE,
clinicaltrials.gov, PubMed, and Scopus databases (without language restrictions), as well as
other registries and scientific meeting presentations, from database inception through
August 15, 2016.
STUDY SELECTION Randomized clinical trials evaluating the effect of thiazolidinedione
therapy on histologic features of the liver in biopsy-proven NASH.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Two investigators extracted study data independently and
in duplicate and rated the risk of bias using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was a dichotomous improvement in
advanced fibrosis on liver biopsy, defined as an improvement in fibrosis stage from F3-F4 to
F0-F2. Secondary outcomes were at least a 1-point improvement in fibrosis of any stage and
NASH resolution. This meta-analysis also evaluated adverse effects of thiazolidinedione
therapy, including weight gain, lower limb edema, congestive heart failure, bone fractures,
cancer, and anemia. With the use of random-effects models, dichotomous variables are
presented as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs, and continuous variables are presented as
weighted mean differences with 95% CIs.
RESULTS This study analyzed 8 RCTs (5 evaluating pioglitazone use and 3 evaluating
rosiglitazone maleate use) enrolling 516 patients with biopsy-proven NASH for a duration of 6
to 24 months. Among all studies combined, thiazolidinedione therapy was associated with
improved advanced fibrosis (OR, 3.15; 95% CI, 1.25-7.93; P = .01; I2 = 0%), fibrosis of any
stage (OR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.12-2.47; P = .01; I2 = 0%), and NASH resolution (OR, 3.22; 95% CI,
2.17-4.79; P < .001; I2 = 0%). Analyses restricted to RCTs enrolling patients without diabetes
yielded similar results for improvement in advanced fibrosis (OR, 2.95; 95% CI, 1.04-10.90;
P = .02; I2 = 0%), improvement in fibrosis of any stage (OR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.02-3.03; P = .02;
I2 = 0%), and NASH resolution (OR, 3.40; 95% CI, 1.95-5.93; P < .001; I2 = 0%). All effects
were accounted for by pioglitazone use. Weight gain and lower limb edema occurred more
frequently with thiazolidinedione therapy (initial body weight +2.70%; 95% CI, 1.96%-4.34%;
P = .001). The small sample size of included RCTs prevented evaluation of more serious
adverse effects of thiazolidinedione therapy.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Pioglitazone use improves advanced fibrosis in NASH, even in
patients without diabetes. Whether this finding translates to improvement in risk for clinical
outcomes requires further study.

N
onalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most
common chronic liver disease in the world, encom-
passing a histological spectrum ranging from simple
steatosis to steatosis plus necroinflammation, known as non-
alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), with variable stages of fibro-
sis. Both fibrosis stage and NASH can only be assessed by liver
biopsy.1
There is no established treatment for NASH, which is the
second leading cause of liver disease among adults awaiting
liver transplant and is projected by 2020 to be the leading in-
dicationforlivertransplant.2,3Extensiveexperimentalandepi-
demiological evidence suggests that the presence of ad-
vanced fibrosis (stage F3-F4) (ie, bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis)
on liver biopsy is the only independent predictor of poor out-
comesinNAFLD;overallandliver-relatedmortality,livertrans-
plant, and liver-related complications are increased in ad-
vancedfibrosisbutnotinpatientswithNASHormilderfibrosis
(stage F0-F2), whose prognosis is similar to that of the gen-
eralpopulation.4,5Recentguidelineshighlighttheneedtoiden-
tify patients with NAFLD with advanced fibrosis to target them
formoreintensivemonitoringfortheonsetofcomplications.6,7
However, although reversal of advanced fibrosis has been gen-
erally associated with improved clinical outcomes in other
causes of chronic liver disease,8,9 this stage of disease was not
improved by any of the treatments evaluated to date in ran-
domized clinical trials (RCTs) of NASH.10,11
The thiazolidinedione antidiabetic agents have been ex-
tensively evaluated in NASH. While access to rosiglitazone ma-
leate has been restricted by the US Food and Drug Administra-
tion,pioglitazonehydrochloridecontinuestoberecommended
in current diabetes guidelines, and novel data evaluating this
drug in NASH have been recently published.12 The results of a
previous meta-analysis10 suggested that thiazolidinedione
therapy improved histological features of NASH but not ad-
vanced fibrosis. Therefore, we analyzed the evidence on thia-
zolidinedione therapy in NASH, focusing on their effect in ad-
vanced fibrosis.
Methods
Data Sources and Searches
The study protocol was approved by the Humanitas Grad-
enigo Review Board. We searched English-language and non–
English-language publications in MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE
In-Process, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, clinicaltrials.gov,
PubMed, and Scopus databases from database inception
through August 15, 2016. We also reviewed abstracts from an-
nual meetings of the American Association for the Study of
Liver Disease, American Gastroenterological Association, Eu-
ropean Association for the Study of Liver, American Diabetes
Association, European Association for the Study of Diabetes,
and Digestive Disease Week. All included references were sub-
jected to the same quality assessment.
Search terms were nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH),
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), fatty liver, liver fat,
steatosis, liver enzymes, transaminase, alanine aminotransfer-
ase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), γ-glutamyl trans-
ferase (GGT), severity of liver disease, fibrosis, advanced fibro-

ample of the full electronic search strategy is included in the
eMethods in the Supplement.
Study Selection
Inclusion criteria were English-language and non–English
-language articles reporting RCTs enrolling participants of any
sex or racial/ethnic origin with NAFLD or NASH, diagnosed
on the basis of radiological or histological evidence of steato-
sis according to accepted criteria.1 Relevant meta-analyses
were also included if they followed the Preferred Reporting
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA)
guidelines.13
Excluded from the meta-analysis were nonhuman stud-
ies, nonrandomized trials, letters, and case reports. Also ex-
cluded were studies enrolling fewer than 10 participants, ar-
ticles not reporting outcomes of interest or primary data
(editorials and review articles), and investigations using inad-
equate case definitions or enrolling patients with secondary
steatosis (eg, drug-induced steatosis and total parenteral nu-
trition–induced steatosis).
Data Extraction and Quality Assessment
Data were extracted from each study by 2 of us (G.M. and M.C.)
independently and in duplicate. Agreement between the 2 re-
viewersonstudyselectionandqualityassessmentofstudieswas
evaluatedbyκstatistics,anddisagreementwasresolvedbymu-
tual discussion. Authors were contacted to obtain further data
and to verify methodological quality. Data were then extracted

Key Points
Question What is the association of thiazolidinedione therapy
with advanced liver fibrosis in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis?
Findings In this meta-analysis of 8 randomized clinical trials
enrolling 516 patients with biopsy-proven nonalcoholic
steatohepatitis, thiazolidinedione therapy was associated with
reversed advanced fibrosis, improved overall fibrosis stages, and
resolution of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Pioglitazone
hydrochloride use accounted for all of the effects of
thiazolidinedione therapy in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and
these benefits were observed in patients without diabetes as well.
Meaning Pioglitazone use improves advanced fibrosis in
nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, even in patients without diabetes,
and may thus halt disease progression to end-stage liver disease in
this patient population.

Data Synthesis and Analysis
The primary outcome variable was a dichotomous improve-
ment in advanced fibrosis (stage F3-F4) on liver biopsy, de-
fined as a 2-point improvement in fibrosis stage from F3-F4
to F0-F2 on the NASH Clinical Research Network Scale. An im-
provement in advanced fibrosis was defined in the following
2 ways: (1) the number of individuals among all patients with
NASH included in the RCT whose fibrosis stage had changed
from F3-F4 to F0-F2 at the end of treatment and (2) the num-
ber of individuals among patients with NASH with advanced
fibrosis (stage F3-F4) at baseline whose fibrosis stage had
changed from F3-F4 to F0-F2 at the end of treatment.
Secondary dichotomous outcome variables were at least
a 1-point improvement in fibrosis of any stage on the NASH
Clinical Research Network Scale in patients with NASH and
NASH resolution, with fibrosis stage and NASH defined ac-
cording to current guidelines.1 We also evaluated adverse ef-
fectsofthiazolidinedionetherapy,includingweightgain,lower
limb edema, congestive heart failure, bone fractures, cancer,
and anemia.

effectsmodels,withsignificancesetatP = .05.Statisticalhetero-
geneity was assessed with the I2 statistic. Using I2 of 50% or
higher, we planned to explore individual study characteristics
and those of subgroups in the main body of evidence.
Sensitivity analysis was performed by removing 1 study at
a time and repeating the meta-analysis to assess whether any
single study substantially affected pooled estimates. In addi-
tion, we planned a priori subgroup analysis according to the
following criteria: RCTs evaluating rosiglitazone use vs RCTs
evaluating pioglitazone use, RCTs enrolling exclusively pa-
tientswithoutdiabetesvsRCTsalsoenrollingpatientswithdia-
betes, and treatment duration of 1 year or less vs longer than 1
year and different dosages, as well as for each item of the
Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool.
When at least 8 comparisons were available, the effect of
age, changes in insulin resistance (as estimated by the homeo-
stasis model of insulin resistance index), and treatment dura-
tion on assessed outcomes was evaluated by meta-regression
analysis(usingrandom-effectsmodels,withwithin-studyvari-
ance estimated with the unrestricted maximum likelihood
method).Publicationbiaswasexaminedusingfunnelplotsand

in tables or estimated from bar charts. For missing SDs of the
mean change in scores and where the P value was provided
for a comparison between treated and control groups, the SD
was calculated by converting the P value to a t statistic with
appropriate df and then calculating SEs and SDs. If neither the
SD nor the P values were supplied, imputation of an SD from
studieswithsimilarmeasurementmethods,trialduration,and
measurement error was used if available, tested in a sensitiv-
ity analysis, and reported if the estimate differed meaning-
fully from previous estimates.
Results
The agreement between reviewers was good to excellent. The
κ statistics were 0.88 for study selection and 0.92 for quality
assessment.
A flow diagram of study selection is shown in Figure 1.
We identified 8 RCTs (5 evaluating pioglitazone use and 3
evaluating rosiglitazone use, with posttreatment histological
features of the liver) enrolling 516 patients. Trial durations
were 6 to 24 months, with daily dosages ranging from 4 to 8
mg for rosiglitazone maleate and from 30 to 45 mg for piogli-
tazone hydrochloride (Table).12,15-21 For the included RCTs,
the histopathological scoring system proposed by the NASH
Clinical Research Network was used to score the severity of
histological features of the liver, as recommended by current
guidelines.1,6,7 Fibrosis was assessed by Masson trichrome
stain, and the pathologist intraobserver and interobserver
agreement for fibrosis staging was good to excellent (κ statis-
tic, ≥0.82).
The agreement between reviewers for quality assess-
ment was good (κ statistic, 0.84). Overall, 6 RCTs had a low risk
of bias in key domains, while 2 RCTs (both evaluating rosi-
glitazone use) demonstrated a higher risk of bias because of
unclear blinding and randomization concealment.19,20
Pooled results of RCTs showed that thiazolidinedione
therapy was associated with improved advanced fibrosis
(Figure 2). The effect size was significant when considering all
patients with NASH (Figure 2A) and only patients with NASH
withadvancedfibrosisatbaseline(Figure2B).Inaddition,thia-
zolidinedione therapy was associated with improved fibrosis
of any stage and induced NASH resolution (Figure 3). Statis-
tical heterogeneity was low for all evaluated outcomes, sug-
gesting a consistent effect size across studies.
After the analysis to RCTs enrolling exclusively to
patients without diabetes was restricted, pooled ORs
remained similar in magnitude and direction to the overall
effect. Among the 4 studies, thiazolidinedione therapy was
associated with improvement in advanced fibrosis (OR, 2.95;
95% CI, 1.04-10.90; P = .02; I2 = 0%), improvement in fibro-
sis of any stage (OR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.02-3.03; P = .02;
I2 = 0%), and NASH resolution (OR, 3.40; 95% CI, 1.95-5.93;
P < .001; I2 = 0%).
Trialduration,dosage,andexclusionofthe2RCTs16,18with
a high risk of bias (both evaluating rosiglitazone use) did not
affect the magnitude and direction of the overall effect. Meta-
regressionanalysisfoundnoassociationbetweenassessedout-
comes and age, homeostasis model of insulin resistance in-
dex, and treatment duration.
The separate analyses of rosiglitazone and pioglitazone
demonstrated that the observed effects of thiazolidinedione
therapy were accounted for by pioglitazone use. Rosiglita-
zone use did not reach statistical significance for any histo-
logical outcome (Figure 2).
TheEggertestandfunnelplotanalysisfoundnostrongevi-
dence for publication bias. These results are shown in eFig-
ure 1 in the Supplement.
Thiazolidinedione therapy was associated with a mean
2.7% weight gain compared with controls (eFigure 2 in the
Supplement). It was also associated with a higher OR for lower
limb edema (2.36; 95% CI, 1.15-4.84; P = .02; I2 = 0%) (6 stud-
ies), without any significant difference in agents, RCTs, or trial
duration.
Reporting of other adverse events was variable. Recog-
nized adverse effects, such as congestive heart failure, were
reported in fewer than half of the RCTs.

Discussion
In this meta-analysis of 8 RCTs of thiazolidinedione therapy,
we found that treatment for up to 24 months was associated
with improved advanced fibrosis and fibrosis of any stage and
NASH resolution. These effects were mainly accounted for by
pioglitazone use. Benefits were also observed in patients with
NASHwithoutdiabetes.Asidefromweightgainandlowerlimb
edema, no major adverse events were reported during the trial
durations, with recognizable power limitations of our analy-
sis because of the few included RCTs.

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is becoming a major public
health issue and is a leading cause of liver transplant.2,3,6,7,22
Among the clinical and histological features of NAFLD, the se-
verity of liver fibrosis has been mechanistically and epidemio-
logically linked to increased overall and liver-related mortal-
ity and liver-related complications. Specifically, advanced
fibrosis (stage F3-F4) (ie, bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis) on liver
biopsy is the strongest independent predictor of poor out-
comes in NAFLD and NASH and has been recognized in re-
cent guidelines as the main diagnostic and therapeutic target
to halt NASH progression to end-stage liver disease, change the
natural history of the disease, and improve long-term prog-
nosis of patients with NASH.4-7,23,24 Unfortunately, none of the
pharmacologicalagentsevaluatedinpriorphase1,2,and3ran-
domized trials showed improvement of advanced fibrosis in
patients with NASH.10,11
We found that thiazolidinedione therapy (specifically
pioglitazone use) for up to 24 months was associated with a

reversal of advanced fibrosis stage in NASH and may thus
improve long-term prognosis in this subgroup of patients
who are at higher risk of poor liver-related outcomes.4-7
These benefits were also observed in patients without diabe-
tes, which may prompt the extension of approved indica-
tions for pioglitazone use.
It is unclear why pioglitazone use (and not rosiglitazone
use) accounted for all of the benefits observed with thiazoli-
dinedione therapy in our analysis, indicating that this obser-
vation may not be a class effect of these drugs. Possible dif-
ferences can be explained by the differential effects of
pioglitazone and rosiglitazone on inflammation and fibrosis
mechanisms, such as through up-regulation of adiponectin,
activation of adenosine monophosphate–activated protein ki-
nase, and induction of hepatic stellate cell senescence.25,26
Thebenefitsofpioglitazoneuseshouldbeweighedagainst
itsadverseeffects,whichinouranalysiswerelimitedtoweight
gain and lower limb edema. The short trial durations (≤24
months) and few included RCTs may have limited the power
of our analysis to detect more serious adverse effects of thia-
zolidinedione therapy. Therefore, careful tailoring of indi-
vidual risk-benefit profiles will be essential to limit exposure
to adverse effects of pioglitazone use. The restriction of pio-
glitazone use to those patients with advanced liver fibrosis and
a higher risk of liver-related death seems plausible. Two pa-
tients with NASH with advanced fibrosis would be needed to
take pioglitazone to improve advanced fibrosis in 1 patient
(number needed to treat, 1.9).
Limiting the duration of pioglitazone use may also
reduce exposure to adverse effects. Within this context, 2
trials12,27 suggest that the use of thiazolidinedione therapy be-
yond 18 months does not offer significant additional histo-
logical benefit. Finally, a key issue after pioglitazone discon-
tinuation is the prevention of liver disease recurrence. Other
study28 results suggest that the durability of histological re-
sponse obtained with thiazolidinedione therapy depends on
the achievement of sustained lifestyle changes, particularly in-
creased physical activity.
Limitations
Limitations of our meta-analysis, which are inherent to the na-
ture of the included studies, need to be mentioned. Included
RCTs had small sample sizes and evaluated the effect of thia-
zolidinedionetherapyonhistologicalfeaturesoftheliverrather
than on clinical outcomes. However, as acknowledged by con-
sensus of the American Association for the Study of Liver Dis-
eases and the US Food and Drug Administration,29 because of
the slow progressive nature of NASH it is impractical and un-
feasible to perform larger studies of long duration to identify
treatment-related clinical benefits, and histological features
of the liver offer the best surrogate measure of the risk of liver-
related complications. Among all histological features of
NAFLD, advanced liver fibrosis has been mechanistically and
epidemiologically linked to an increased risk of adverse liver-
related complications in NAFLD, and reversal of advanced fi-
brosis portends an improved prognosis in diverse causes of
chronic liver disease.8,9,11
Conclusions
Recent guidelines recommend identification of patients with
NAFLD with advanced fibrosis to target them for more inten-
sive monitoring of the onset of complications but acknowl-
edge the lack of therapeutic options that effectively reverse
advanced stages of liver disease.1,6,7 The new finding in this
meta-analysis is that treatment with the antidiabetic drug pio-
glitazone reverses the more advanced stages of liver disease
in NASH regardless of the presence of diabetes, which pro-
vides a rationale for evaluating the effect of this drug on clini-
cal outcomes in this subgroup of patients at higher risk of liver-
related complications.

Invited Commentary
The Role of Pioglitazone in the Management
of Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis
Are We There Yet?
Hal F. Yee Jr, MD, PhD
Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and its clinical
sequelae have become an increasingly prevalent and impor-
tant cause of hepatic morbidity and mortality.1 Despite
almost 2 decades of intense study, we are still not certain
how best to treat NASH. In this issue of JAMA Internal Medi-
cine, Musso and colleagues present a meta-analysis that
suggests that thizaolidinedione use is associatyed with
improvement in advanced
fibrosis in NASH, even in
patients without diabetes.2
Other medications in the
thiazolidinedione class did not demonstrate a significant
effect in treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, there-
fore this commentary focuses on pioglitazone. Although
this article makes a significant contribution to our under-
standing of the potential role that this thiazolidinedione
may have in the management of NASH, there remain sub-
stantive questions that need to be addressed before pioglita-
zone hydrochloride can be recommended as a treatment for
patients with NASH.
Does pioglitazone alter clinical outcomes, such as devel-
opment of ascites or encephalopathy, need for liver transplan-
tation,orliver-relateddeath?Thismeta-analysisidentifiedsig-
nificant improvements in histological features of the liver in
patients treated with pioglitazone, but it did not look at clini-
cal outcomes. Although liver histological status is a com-
monly used surrogate outcome in evaluating the efficacy of
treatments for other hepatic conditions, it might not corre-
late as well with clinical outcomes in patients with NASH, who
are often obese and have type 2 diabetes and other complica-
tions of metabolic syndrome. Such patients are at high risk for
serious cardiovascular and neurovascular complications (ie,
myocardial infarction or stroke), which could influence clini-
cal outcome more strongly than the complications of NASH.
Further longitudinal studies will be required to determine if
pioglitazone improves clinical outcomes.
