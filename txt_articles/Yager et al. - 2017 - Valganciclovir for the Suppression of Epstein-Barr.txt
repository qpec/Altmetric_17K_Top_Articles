Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) causes infectious mononucleosis 
and can lead to lymphoproliferative diseases. We evaluated the 
effects of valganciclovir on oral EBV shedding in a random-
ized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Twenty-six men 
received oral valganciclovir or daily placebo for 8 weeks, fol-
lowed by a 2-week “washout period” and then 8 weeks of the 
alternative treatment. Valganciclovir reduced the proportion of 
days with EBV detected from 61.3% to 17.8% (relative risk, 0.28; 
95% confidence interval [CI], .21–.41; P < .001), and quantity 
of virus detected by 0.77 logs (95% CI, .62–.91 logs; P < .001). 
Further investigations into the impact of valganciclovir on 
EBV-associated diseases are needed.

Primary infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is 
usually subclinical; however, EBV is the main cause of infectious 
mononucleosis. Following acute infection, the virus persists 
in host B and T lymphocytes, monocytes, and epithelial cells; 
asymptomatic salivary viral shedding leads to onward trans-
mission [1]. Unlike other herpesviruses, EBV can cause B-cell 
transformation and is associated with malignancies including 
Hodgkin, non-Hodgkin, Burkitt, and primary central nervous 
system lymphomas, posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease 
(PTLD), nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and gastric cancer [2].
The role of antiviral therapies in the treatment of acute and 
chronic EBV-associated disease is unclear. Acyclovir reduces 
EBV replication by inhibiting viral DNA polymerase, and stud-
ies have found that both acyclovir and the prodrug valacyclo-
vir reduce oral shedding of EBV in patients with infectious 
mononucleosis. However, only 1 study suggested that valacy-
clovir (1 g every 8 hours for 14 days) expedited the resolution 
of clinical symptoms associated with infectious mononucleosis 
[3]. Furthermore, case reports and small studies have sug-
gested a possible role for antiviral treatment of PTLD and EBV-
associated hemophagocytic syndrome [4], although definitive 
data have remained elusive.
Valganciclovir, an oral valine ester prodrug of the antivi-
ral ganciclovir, is indicated for treatment of cytomegalovirus 
(CMV) infection. Few data exist examining the impact of val-
ganciclovir on EBV replication in vivo, though a recent study of 
valganciclovir on T-cell activation in human immunodeficiency 
virus type 1 (HIV-1)–infected participants found a significant 
decline in levels of salivary EBV among those on valganciclo-
vir [5]. Additionally, observational data support the role of 
valganciclovir in suppressing replication and reducing clinical 
disease associated with EBV [6]. Our group previously con-
ducted a randomized controlled trial to determine the impact 
of valganciclovir on oral shedding rates of human herpesvirus 
8 (HHV-8) and CMV, and found the drug reduced shedding of 
both viruses significantly [7]. Using oral swabs collected from 
this study, we sought to determine the impact of valganciclovir 
on in vivo replication of EBV.
METHODS
Study Participants, Setting, and Design
Men with oropharyngeal HHV-8 detected on ≥40% of 
days in prior studies were recruited for enrollment [7]. We 
excluded potential participants if they were taking medi-
cations with known activity against human herpesviruses, 
had known bone marrow suppression, hypersensitivity 
to ganciclovir, renal or hepatic dysfunction, or a history 
of CMV disease. Persons with HIV on antiretroviral ther-
apy (ART) were required to remain on a stable regimen 
throughout the study period. The study was conducted at 
the University of Washington Virology Research Clinic in 
Seattle, Washington, between February 2003 and February 
2005. The study protocol was approved by the University of 
Washington Human Subjects Review Board and all partici-
pants signed a consent form.
The study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-con-
trolled, crossover trial. Randomization was completed through 
a computer-generated random number assignment and strati-
fied by HIV status. Study participants were randomly assigned 
to receive either oral valganciclovir 900 mg daily or matching 
placebo, once daily for 8 weeks. Following the initial 8-week 
administration of either valganciclovir or placebo, partici-
pants received no study drug for a 2-week washout period. 
Subsequently, participants received the alternative treatment 
(valganciclovir or placebo) for a second 8-week period. All par-
ticipants collected daily oropharyngeal swabs and maintained a

diary of symptoms, missed school or work days, and visits to a 
healthcare provider.
Laboratory Analysis
Serum samples were tested for HIV and CMV antibodies using 
commercial enzyme immunoassays. DNA was extracted from 
oropharyngeal swabs for real-time quantitative polymerase 
chain reaction (PCR) amplification of EBV using primers to 
amplify the BALF5 gene. Swabs were considered positive for 
oral EBV shedding if PCR analysis detected ≥150 copies of EBV 
DNA per milliliter.
Statistical Analysis
The primary endpoint for this analysis was the reduction in fre-
quency of oral EBV shedding, defined as the ratio of days on which 
EBV was detected of all days on which oral samples were obtained, 
during valganciclovir administration compared with placebo. 
Additionally, the reduction in the quantity of EBV shed was deter-
mined on the days with EBV detection. The crossover study design 
allowed each individual to serve as his own control.
To evaluate the efficacy of valganciclovir in reducing EBV 
shedding frequency, we created generalized linear mixed mod-
els using the Poisson distribution and log link. To evaluate the 
efficacy of valganciclovir in reducing the quantity of EBV, we 
used linear mixed-effects models. The mean log10 copies per 
milliliter of EBV detected was calculated using all days on 
which EBV was detected. We tested the period and sequence 
effect by creating covariates for time period and for the interac-
tion between time period and treatment.
RESULTS
Twenty-six men were enrolled, with a median age of 42 years 
(range, 24–66 years). Most participants (65%) reported their race 
as white. All participants self-identified as men who have sex with 
men (MSM), and 16 participants (62%) were HIV-1 infected. 
Among HIV-1–infected men, the median HIV-1 RNA plasma level 
was log10 3.7 copies per mL (range, 1.2–5.3 copies/mL), and median 
CD4 T-cell count was 434 cells/μL (range, 49–936 cells/mL). Eight 
of 16 HIV-1–infected individuals were receiving combination 
antiretroviral therapy (cART) with at least 3 medications [7].
Because swabs were collected daily for 8 weeks during both the 
placebo and drug arms, each participant was expected to submit 
56 swabs per study arm, and an additional 14 swabs during the 
washout period. Participants collected a mean of 49 swabs (range, 
29–62 swabs) on the valganciclovir arm and a mean of 50 swabs 
(range, 3–61 swabs) on the placebo arm. Of 3276 anticipated 
swabs, 2931 (89.5%) were submitted by participants for analysis.
Of 5560 pills dispensed, 286 (5.1%) were returned, result-
ing in an estimated median adherence rate of 97.1% (range, 
73%–100%). Adherence rates were similar in the placebo and 
valganciclovir study arms (P = .68) [7]. Medication was well 
tolerated; no serious adverse events occurred throughout the 
study. No participant experienced renal insufficiency, anemia, 
or thrombocytopenia on either placebo or valganciclovir [7].
Impact of Valganciclovir on Oropharyngeal Shedding of EBV
EBV was detected at least once in 25 of 26 participants. During 
valganciclovir administration, EBV was detected in oropharyn-
geal secretions on 229 of 1286 days (17.8%), compared with 803 
of 1309 days (61.3%) on placebo, yielding a 72% reduction in 
the frequency of EBV shedding on valganciclovir compared 
with placebo (relative risk [RR], 0.28; 95% confidence interval 
[CI], .21–.41; P < .001). The quantity of EBV shed in the oro-
pharynx on days with virus detected was also reduced from a 
mean of 4.3 log10 copies/mL (standard deviation [SD], 1.2 log10 
copies/mL) of EBV during placebo administration compared 
with a mean of 3.6 (SD, 1.2 log10 copies/mL) of EBV during val-
ganciclovir administration (Figure 1). Valganciclovir therefore 
reduced the quantity of EBV by 0.77 logs (95% CI, .62–.91 logs; 
P < .001) (Table 1).
While on placebo, HIV-1–uninfected participants had EBV 
detected on 27.6% of days evaluated, compared with 81.1% for 
HIV-1–infected individuals receiving cART and 84.4% for HIV-
infected individuals not receiving cART. While on valganciclovir, 
HIV-1–uninfected participants had EBV detected on 7.6% of days 
evaluated, compared with 26.6% for HIV-1–infected individuals 
receiving cART and 20.5% for HIV-1–infected individuals not 
receiving cART (Table 1). However, the effect of valganciclovir 
was similar regardless of HIV-1 status, with a 72.4% reduction in 
EBV shedding frequency among HIV-1–uninfected participants 
and a 71.5% reduction among HIV-1–infected participants.
When we adjusted for HIV status and cART use, the impact 
of valganciclovir on EBV shedding frequency and quantity 
remained unchanged. When we included the interactions of 
both HIV status and cART receipt on valganciclovir use in the 
model, we did not find a significant difference in the impact of 
valganciclovir use based on HIV status (P = .99). The model did 
not change when covariates accounting for either time period 
or interactions between time period and valganciclovir use were 
included, indicating that there was no sequence effect and that 
the 14-day washout period was sufficient.
Discussion
Our results indicate that oral valganciclovir administered once 
daily substantially reduced both the rate of oral EBV shedding 
and the quantity of virus shed. The effect was equally pro-
nounced among HIV-infected and -uninfected men.
Prior studies have reported a similar impact of other antivi-
ral therapies during acute EBV infection [3]. However, reduced 
viral shedding was not associated with significant changes in the 
duration of clinical symptoms or in overall clinical outcomes [8].
Recipients both of solid organ transplant (SOT) and of hema-
topoietic cell transplant (HCT) are at risk for PTLD. Though 
the widespread use of rituximab therapy has dramatically 
 200 • JID 2017:216 (15 July) • BRIEF REPORT
improved PTLD survival rates, mortality following PTLD diag-
nosis remains approximately 27%–30% [9]. The effect of anti-
viral prophylaxis on the risk of PTLD varies between studies, 
with some showing no effect. However, one study reported a 
reduction in PTLD incidence from 3.9% to 0.5% of SOT recipi-
ents who received either acyclovir (administered orally 4 times 
daily) or ganciclovir (administered intravenously) during 
highly immunosuppressive antilymphocyte antibody therapy 
[10]. A subsequent multicenter case-control study evaluating 
renal-only transplants found up to an 83% reduction in the 
risk of PTLD, with variation between antiviral agents. Notably, 
ganciclovir was associated with a 38% risk reduction of early 
PTLD for each 30-day period during an individual’s first year 
posttransplant [11]. Despite these promising results, a definitive 
study of ganciclovir or valganciclovir in PTLD prevention has 
not been done, and further data are needed to better elucidate 
the role of valganciclovir in PTLD prophylaxis.
Individuals with HIV infection can also develop severe 
clinical manifestations of EBV infection, including oral hairy 
leukoplakia and lymphoma. However, few studies have eval-
uated the role of antiviral therapy for EBV in HIV-infected 
individuals in the cART era. Previous studies by our group 
showed increased EBV shedding associated with uncontrolled 
HIV viremia [12]; more recent data suggest that persistence of 
CMV and EBV DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
of HIV-infected MSM is associated with slower decay of HIV 
DNA. These findings indicate that replicating herpesviruses 
may promote persistence of the HIV viral reservoir [13], and 
suggest a possible role for antiviral therapy in HIV-infected 
individuals. The role valganciclovir could play in the clinical 
management of HIV-infected patients in the ART era remains 
to be defined.
Most prior studies evaluating antiviral therapy for EBV-
associated disease have considered multiple drugs simultane-
ously. However, in vitro experiments revealed that EBV tyrosine 
kinase has variable affinity for the antiherpetic antivirals [14]. 
In prior studies examining HHV-8, valacyclovir and famciclo-
vir led to reductions of 18% and 30%, respectively [15], while 
valganciclovir reduced shedding frequency by 46% [7], suggest-
ing that valganciclovir could play a role in treating complicated 
acute EBV infection and preventing PTLD.
Our study has several limitations. First, all study partici-
pants were selected based on their history of HHV-8 shedding. 
Individuals with high rates of oral HHV-8 shedding could have 
higher rates of EBV shedding than the general population, indi-
cating the need for cautious extrapolation from this patient 
population. Second, all study participants were men, although 
natural history does not suggest that the outcome of EBV infec-
tion varies with sex. Third, the optimal dose of valganciclovir 
needed to prevent EBV-related disease is unclear. The induc-
tion phase of CMV treatment generally requires 900 mg of val-
ganciclovir given twice daily; subsequent maintenance therapy 
requires only 900 mg daily. Because of the potential drug toxic-
ities and lack of clinical benefit in this proof-of-concept study,

we used the lower dose. A higher dose could possibly result in 
a greater viral load reduction, though any resulting benefit may 
be offset by additional toxicities and costs. Further studies are 
needed to compare different dosing strategies and to determine 
differential clinical benefit and toxicity profiles.
In summary, we found a substantial decrease in oral shed-
ding of EBV when participants received once-daily valganciclo-
vir compared with placebo, suggesting that valganciclovir may 
have utility as an important prophylactic or therapeutic agent 
for EBV-related disease.
