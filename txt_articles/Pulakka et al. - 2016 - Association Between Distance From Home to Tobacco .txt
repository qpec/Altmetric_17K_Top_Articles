IMPORTANCE Reduced availability of tobacco outlets is hypothesized to reduce smoking, but
longitudinal evidence on this issue is scarce.
OBJECTIVE To examine whether changes in distance from home to tobacco outlet are
associated with changes in smoking behaviors.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The data from 2 prospective cohort studies included
geocoded residential addresses, addresses of tobacco outlets, and responses to smoking
surveys in 2008 and 2012 (the Finnish Public Sector [FPS] study, n = 53 755) or 2003 and
2012 (the Health and Social Support [HeSSup] study, n = 11 924). All participants were
smokers or ex-smokers at baseline. We used logistic regression in between-individual
analyses and conditional logistic regression in case-crossover design analyses to examine
change in walking distance from home to the nearest tobacco outlet as a predictor of quitting
smoking in smokers and smoking relapse in ex-smokers. Study-specific estimates were
pooled using fixed-effect meta-analysis.
EXPOSURES Walking distance from home to the nearest tobacco outlet.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Quitting smoking and smoking relapse as indicated by
self-reported current and previous smoking at baseline and follow-up.
RESULTS Overall, 20 729 men and women (age range 18-75 years) were recruited. Of the
6259 and 2090 baseline current smokers, 1744 (28%) and 818 (39%) quit, and of the 8959
and 3421 baseline ex-smokers, 617 (7%) and 205 (6%) relapsed in the FPS and HeSSup
studies, respectively. Among the baseline smokers, a 500-m increase in distance from home
to the nearest tobacco outlet was associated with a 16% increase in odds of quitting smoking
in the between-individual analysis (pooled odds ratio, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.05-1.28) and 57%
increase in within-individual analysis (pooled odds ratio, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.32-1.86), after
adjusting for changes in self-reported marital and working status, substantial worsening of
financial situation, illness in the family, and own health status. Increase in distance to the
nearest tobacco outlet was not associated with smoking relapse among the ex-smokers.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These data suggest that increase in distance from home to
the nearest tobacco outlet may increase quitting among smokers. No effect of change in
distance on relapse in ex-smokers was observed.

S
moking continues to be a leading health risk
globally,1,2 emphasizing the need for identifying mea-
sures to curb the tobacco epidemic.3 Tobacco retail
outlets in residential environment received increasing atten-
tion as potential targets for policies to reduce smoking.4,5
However, there is currently insufficient evidence to demon-
strate a causal association between tobacco retail environ-
ment and smoking behaviors.
Easier residential access to cigarettes is associated with
higher likelihood of smoking in cross-sectional studies.6-10
However, cross-sectional data do not provide a secure basis to
infer causality. In the few longitudinal studies addressing this
question, the findings have been inconsistent.11-14 Depend-
ing on the study, proximity of residence to tobacco outlets has
predicted smoking behaviors in high poverty areas but not in
affluent areas,13 in men but not in women,14 and when using
proximity but not density-based indicators of access.11 Some
studies have failed to show any association with smoking
behavior.12 Importantly, none of the existing prospective stud-
ies have been informative about the effect of a change in ac-
cess to tobacco on changes in smoking behaviors—a key issue
for policy.
To address some of these limitations, we linked repeated
assessments of self-reported smoking behaviors to repeated
data on the walking distance from home to the closest to-
bacco outlet using geocoded data. For comparison, we also as-
sessed the number of tobacco outlets close to home, a density-
based measure. Our aim was to examine whether change in
proximityoftobaccostoresintheresidentialneighborhoodwas
associated with quitting smoking or smoking relapse.
Methods
Study Setting and Population
The data were drawn from 2 prospective cohort studies: the
Finnish Public Sector (FPS) study and the Health and Social
Support (HeSSup) study. The FPS included employees repre-
senting a wide range of occupations working in 10 towns and
6 hospital districts; they responded to 2 identifiable postal sur-
veys in 2008 (baseline) and 2012 (follow-up) (2009 and 2013,
respectively, if they had retired or left the organizations).14
HeSSup targeted a sample representative of the Finnish popu-
lation in 4 age groups (20-24, 30-34, 40-44, and 50-54 years)
in 1998.15 For the present analysis of HeSSup, the baseline sur-
vey was sent in 2003 and the follow-up in 2012. The FPS was
approved by the ethics committee of the Hospital District of
Helsinki and Uusimaa and HeSSup by the joint ethics commit-
tee of the University of Turku and the Turku University
Central Hospital.
Figure 1 presents the selection of the analytic sample. We
included the FPS participants who responded to the survey
both in 2008 or 2009 and 2012 or 2013 (n = 53 755, 79% of the
eligible 2008/2009 respondents) and the HeSSup partici-
pants who responded both in 2003 and 2012 (n = 11 924, 63%
of the eligible 2003 participants). We focused on current and
ex-smokersonlyandexcludedthosewhoreportedneversmok-
ing at baseline. In addition, we excluded those with missing
data on smoking in either survey, not residing in mainland
Finland, or with unsuccessful geocoding of residential
address. The analytic sample was therefore 15 218 FPS and 5511
HeSSup participants.
Assessment of the Distance From Home to Tobacco Outlets
The residential address coordinates were derived from
Population Register Centre at the time of the baseline (FPS,
2008/2009; HeSSup, 2003) and follow-up (FPS, 2012/2013;
HeSSup, year 2012) surveys, a data linkage which was success-
ful for all participants. During the follow-up, 5464 FPS par-
ticipants(36%)and2552ofHeSSupparticipants(44%)changed
their residential address.
TobaccoretailhasbeensubjecttolicensinginFinlandsince
April 2009 (eMethods in the Supplement).16 We obtained all
the addresses of outlets with a tobacco retail license effective
in 2010 (baseline) and 2013 (follow-up) from the National
SupervisoryAuthorityforWelfareandHealth.Ageocodingser-
vice, together with the researchers, geocoded the outlet ad-
dresses into EUREF-FIN coordinates using ArcGIS 10.2.2 soft-
ware (Esri Inc). This geocoding was successful for 8166 outlets
(92%) from 2010 and 8286 outlets (96%) from 2013.
In both cohorts, we determined walking distance from the
(1) residential address coordinates at baseline to the 2010 to-
bacco outlet coordinates and (2) from the residential address
coordinates at follow-up to the 2013 tobacco outlet coordi-
nates. Using the 2013 road and street database (Esri Finland
Oy), that includes all roads, streets, and sidewalks17 as a
basemap, we used the Network Analyst tool in ArcGIS to find
the nearest tobacco outlet. As the baseline smoking was mea-
sured earlier (2003) than the baseline tobacco outlet coordi-
nates (2010) in the HeSSup study, we performed a sensitivity
analysisexcludingparticipantswithlikelyunmeasuredchange
in distance to tobacco outlet between 2003 and 2010
(eMethodsintheSupplement).Thishadlittleeffectonthefind-
ings (eTable 1 in the Supplement), suggesting that the time dis-
crepancy in baseline smoking behavior and tobacco outlets in
HeSSup was an unlikely source of major bias.

Key Points
Question Is change in proximity of tobacco outlets in residential
neighborhoods associated with quitting smoking or smoking
relapse?
Finding In 2 independent longitudinal cohorts of smokers, each
500-m increase in distance from home to the nearest tobacco
outlet was associated with a 20% to 60% increase in odds of
quitting smoking. Increase in distance to tobacco outlet was not
associated with the odds of smoking relapse among ex-smokers.
Meaning Reducing tobacco outlets in residential areas could
contribute toward curbing tobacco consumption, a leading cause
of morbidity and mortality.

are likely to travel further away by foot. The results were simi-
lar when using a formula that follows Gaussian dispersion:
exp[−6(distance)1.2]14,18 to quantify the distance (without set-
tingrestrictions)fromhometothenearesttobaccooutlet(eTable
2 in the Supplement). As a density-based measure, we calcu-
lated the number of outlets within 500 m (by straight-line dis-
tance) from home (0, 1, 2 or more) at baseline and follow-up,
and used the difference to measure change in availability.14
Assessment of Smoking Behavior
In all the surveys, smoking status was measured by asking the
participants “Do you smoke or have you previously smoked
regularly, that is daily or nearly daily?” and “Do you still smoke
regularly?”. Those who responded “yes” to the second ques-
tion were defined as baseline smokers while those who re-
sponded“yes”tothefirstand“no”tothesecondquestionwere
defined as ex-smokers. Those who responded “no” to both of
the questions were defined as baseline never smokers. Initia-
tion of smoking in adulthood was rare in both cohorts: only
1% of the FPS participants (370 of 36 625) and 0.4% of the
HeSSup participants (25 of 5999) never smokers started smok-
ing during the follow-up. Consequently, we only focused on
quitting smoking and smoking relapse.
Covariates
Time-invariant covariates, sex and education, were derived
from the employers’registers and Statistics Finland in FPS and
from the baseline survey in HeSSup. Education was used as
an indicator of socioeconomic status and was categorized as
low (vocational school) or high (college or higher). Age, mari-
tal status, employment (working or not), substantial worsen-
ing of one’
s financial situation in past year, death or severe ill-
ness in the family in past year, and chronic diseases (angina
pectorisormyocardialinfarction,cerebrovasculardisease,dia-
betes, cancer, asthma and chronic bronchitis) were self-
reported in the surveys and were treated as time-dependent
covariates because they may potentially influence smoking
behavior19 and lead to moving residence.20
Statistical Analyses
We used logistic regression (the LOGISTIC procedure in SAS)
to assess the likelihood of quitting in baseline smokers and
smoking relapse in baseline ex-smokers. The odds ratios (OR)
and their 95% CI were estimated for a 500-m increase in walk-
ing distance to the nearest tobacco outlet, and, in the subsid-
iaryanalysis,bychangeinthenumberoftobaccooutletswithin
500 m from home. We constructed 2 models: Model 1 was ad-
justed for age and education at baseline; Model 2 was addi-
tionally adjusted both for baseline and follow-up informa-
tion on marital status, employment, chronic diseases,
worsening of financial situation in past year and recent death
or severe illness in the family in past year.
As the above analyses were based on between-individual
comparisons, we further examined the observed associa-
tions in within-individual analyses using conditional logistic
regression in a case-crossover design.21-24 This design en-

requirements of the case-crossover approach, only those par-
ticipants who reported a change in smoking status could be in-
cluded in the analysis. We constructed 2 models to assess the
associationbetweenchangeinwalkingdistancetotobaccoout-
let and quitting smoking. Model 1 was, by design, adjusted for
all time-invariant variables. Model 2 was further adjusted for
changesinindividual-leveltime-varyingcovariates:maritalsta-
tus, work status, chronic diseases, worsening of financial situ-
ation in past year, and death or severe illness in the family in
past year.
We pooled the results of the cohort-specific analyses using
fixed-effect meta-analysis to produce averaged ORs across the
FPS and HeSSup studies, weighing the cohort-specific ORs by
the inverse of their standard errors. Subgroup analyses were
stratified by sex.1 All the cohort-specific analyses were per-
formed using SAS 9.4 statistical software (SAS Institute Inc).
For meta-analysis, we used the metan package of Stata 13.1
(StataCorp).

18-75) years in the 15 218 FPS participants and 44.7 (11; range,
25-59) years in the 5511 HeSSup participants. Median (inter-
quartile range [IQR]) walking distance from home to the near-
est tobacco outlet for the combined sample was 528 (266-
1041) m at baseline. Distance to the nearest outlet changed
in 39% of the participants (median change, 242 m;
range, −997-997 m).
Among the baseline smokers, the adjusted odds for quit-
ting smoking by the follow-up was 1.22 (95% CI, 1.11-1.34) for
a 500-m increase in the distance to the nearest tobacco outlet
(Table 2; pooled analysis). This association was robust to all
adjustments,anditwasobservedinbothcohort-specificanaly-
ses (Table 2) and in men and women (Figure 2). In addition,
the alternative density-based measure (ie, the number of to-
bacco outlets within 500 m from home) was also associated
with quitting, but only among the FPS participants: quitting
smoking was more likely when the number of stores de-
creased (adjusted OR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.06-1.54) (eTable 3 in the
Supplement).
Among the baseline ex-smokers, increase in the distance
to a tobacco outlet was not significantly associated with smok-
ing relapse (Table 2). This null finding was observed in cohort-
specific as well as pooled analyses and was little affected by
adjustments for covariates. The findings for the number of to-
bacco outlets within 500 m and smoking relapse were incon-
sistent (eTable 3 in the Supplement).
The results from the case-crossover design are presented
in Table 3 and eTable 4 in the Supplement. The within-
individualoddsforquittingsmokingper500-mincreaseindis-
tance to a tobacco outlet was 1.69 (95% CI, 1.45-1.97) in the
pooled analysis. The odds were similar and significantly el-
evated among both men and women and in the study-
specific analyses (Table 3). The findings were also robust to ad-
justmentsforcovariates.Thealternativeexposure,thenumber
of tobacco outlets, was also associated with quitting. The ad-
justed OR for quitting smoking was 0.63 (95% CI, 0.46-0.86)
and 0.48 (95% CI, 0.31-0.74) in FPS and HeSSup, respectively,
when having more than 2 tobacco outlets within 500 m from
home compared with none (eTable 4 in the Supplement).
Discussion
In this pooled analysis of 2 prospective cohorts of adults, par-
ticipants were more likely to quit smoking when distance from
home to the nearest tobacco outlet increased. This finding was
robust to adjustments for a range of potential confounders and
was observed both in between-individual comparisons of all
participants and within-individual comparisons using a case-
crossover analysis. Furthermore, the finding was similar in the
2 independent data sets. Our findings regarding the number
of tobacco outlets were less consistent, and we observed no
associationbetweenchangesindistancetotobaccooutletsand
the likelihood of smoking relapse in ex-smokers.
The main strengths of this longitudinal study included the
use of high-resolution data, as practically all residential ad-
dresses and tobacco outlet addresses were successfully geo-
coded.Thesedatawereusedinbetween-individualandwithin-
individual analyses. The advantages of the first approach
include large sample size, longitudinal follow-up, and con-

trolforseveralpotentialconfounders.However,itismoreprone
to bias compared with the case-crossover method because it
does not control as rigorously for time-invariant individual
characteristics of participants (both observed and unob-
served), such as personality and genetic background. In addi-
tion, we were able to control for several major time-variant co-
variates, such as marital status, work status, chronic diseases,
and recent death or severe illness in the family.
The results of this study support a causal association be-
tween decrease in residential availability of tobacco and quit-
ting smoking, and they are consistent with several previous
studies that were not based on within-individual analysis. For
example, similar associations have previously been observed
in studies of adults in the United States,7,11 Scotland,10 and in
moderately or heavily smoking men in Finland,14 whereas in
an English study no association was observed between quit-
ting and availability of tobacco close to residence.12 In agree-
ment, we did not observe associations for changes in tobacco
availability and smoking relapse. This suggests that other fac-
tors, such as presence of other smokers,25 may have stronger
effect on relapsing than availability of tobacco near home.
There are at least 2 plausible mechanisms for reasons why
reduced residential availability of tobacco may decrease smok-
ing. First, having a tobacco outlet closer to home decreases the
time and travel costs related to purchasing tobacco.26,27
Second, higher density of tobacco outlets may promote smok-
ing by increasing environmental cues to smoke.5,28 However,
the latter mechanism is less likely in our study as in Finland
advertising of tobacco, including point-of-sale advertising,
has been prohibited since 1976 and the display of tobacco
products at point-of-sale was banned in January 2012.16
Previous research suggests that people in socioeconomi-
cally deprived neighborhoods smoke more than those in af-
fluent neighborhoods, independently of individual-level so-
cioeconomic status.29-31 Furthermore, some findings support
a link between increase in neighborhood socioeconomic dis-
advantageduetochangeinresidenceandincreasedsmoking.24
In our data, median road distance to the nearest tobacco out-
let was 350 m in neighborhoods with above median social
disadvantage32 and 720 m in the least disadvantaged areas.
High availability of tobacco may be an explanation for in-
creased likelihood of smoking among people living in disad-
vantaged areas.23,29,33
The study also had its limitations. Including no biologi-
cal measures to validate self-reported smoking may have led
to some misclassification of tobacco use, although previous
studies suggest that self-report is a reasonably valid method
to measure smoking behaviors among Finns.34 Although
response rate for FPS was good, a 63% response rate for the
2003 HeSSup participants may have led to nonresponse bias.
We were able to measure availability of tobacco only in resi-
dential environments35 and thus could not include access to
tobacco at other activity locations, such as workplaces. The
case-crossover design best applies in studies where the
exposure is intermittent and affects risk immediately, and
the outcome is abrupt.21 Distance to tobacco outlet fits with
this design as this exposure varies over time; smoking is
similarly a suitable outcome with a distinct onset. However,
we were not able to identify the exact time of quitting; this
could have resulted in some imprecision in the time at each
exposure and outcome category but is an unlikely source of
systematic bias to our results.
Data on tobacco outlet locations were available only from
2010 onwards, which may have caused some measurement er-
ror regarding distance to the nearest tobacco outlet at base-
line in the HeSSup cohort. However, our sensitivity analysis
using availability of alcohol in 2004 and 2010 as proxy mea-
sure for availability of tobacco suggests that a major bias ow-
ing to baseline discrepancy was unlikely. Moreover, findings
regarding quitting were similar in HeSSup and FPS, a cohort
with no discrepancy in baseline measurements, further
increasing confidence to the findings.

The generalizability of our findings should be interpreted
cautiously. Although the participants were drawn from a va-
riety of geographical areas and were from 2 different cohorts
(a population sample and an occupational cohort), all the data
werefromFinland,acountrywhichhasstrictantismokingpoli-
cies. This may limit the generalizability of the findings to so-
cieties with more relaxed regulations concerning the avail-
ability of tobacco. In addition, FPS is an occupational cohort
which limits the generalization of the results from that spe-
cific cohort to the general population. Lastly, we were not able
to examine whether availability of tobacco affected the risk of
initiating smoking. Further studies focusing on never-
smoking adolescents are needed to address this question.
Our findings have important policy implications. Finland
has a goal of a tobacco-free society as a legislative objective.36
Despite this, the prevalence of smoking has remained at 16%,16
suggesting that further measures are needed to reduce
smoking.4,27,37 There are several potential ways to reduce the
number of tobacco outlets, such as limiting tobacco retail li-
censes based on the existing density of tobacco outlets or prox-
imity to schools or hospitals4,5,27,37,38 or offering incentives for
retailers to stop selling tobacco products.4,5,39 Research con-
ducted in New Zealand40 and the United States,41 for ex-
ample, suggest that actions to reduce the number of tobacco
outlets would have public support. Indeed, CVS, among some
other drug-outlet chains in the United States, have stopped
selling cigarettes.42,43
Conclusions
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to exam-
ine the impact of change in access to tobacco on smoking be-
haviors in 2 large independent data sets using between-
individual and within-individual comparisons. We found
robust evidence suggesting that among Finnish adults who
smoked, increase in the distance from home to a tobacco out-
let increased the odds of quitting smoking. Among ex-
smokers, however, change in distance to the nearest tobacco
outlet was not associated with smoking behaviors.
