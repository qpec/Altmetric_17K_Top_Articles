Abstract
Background: Low energy–dense (LED) foods reduce energy intake (EI); whether this effect is sustained over time and
during weight loss is unknown.
Objective: This trial examined the effects of LED compared with high energy–dense (HED) meals on appetite, EI, and
control over eating in the laboratory and during a weight-management program that encourages unrestricted intake of
LED foods [Slimming World, UK (SW)] compared with a self-led Standard Care program [NHS weight-loss plan (SC)].
Methods: Overweight and obese women [n = 96; mean ± SD age: 41.03 ± 12.61 y; mean ± SD body mass index
(in kg/m2): 34.00 ± 3.61] were recruited from the SW or SC programs. Primary outcomes included appetite, food
preferences (liking and wanting for LED and HED foods), cravings, and evening meal EI (LED, HED) in response to
calorie-matched LED (≤0.8 kcal/g) and HED (≥2.5 kcal/g) breakfast and lunch meals. Probe-day tests were conducted at
weeks 3 and 4 and repeated at weeks 12 and 13 in a within-day crossover design. Secondary outcomes, including body
weight and program experience, were measured from weeks 1 to 14 in a parallel-group design. Dietary compliance was
monitored with the use of weighed food diaries at weeks 3 and 12.
Results: Intention-to-treat (ITT) and completers analyses showed that the SW group lost more weight than the SC group
[ITT: −5.9% (95% CI: −4.7%, –7
.2%) compared with −3.5% (−2.3%, −4.8%), P < 0.05; completers: −6.2% (−4.8%,
−7
.6%) compared with 3.9% (−2.5%, −5.2%), P < 0.05]. The SW group reported greater control over eating and more
motivation to continue the program compared with the SC group. LED meals increased sensations of fullness and
reduced hunger on probe days (P < 0.001). Total-day EI was 1057 ± 73 kcal less (95% CI: 912, 1203 kcal; 36%) under
LED compared with HED conditions (P < .001). Liking for LED and HED foods and wanting for HED foods were lower
before lunch under LED compared with HED conditions, and liking decreased to a greater extent after the LED lunch.
The SW group reported fewer cravings under LED compared with HED conditions (P < 0.05). On probe days, appetite
and EI outcomes did not differ between weeks 3 and 12 or between the SW and SC groups.
Conclusion: LED meals improve appetite control in women attempting weight loss and the effect is sustainable. Con-
sumption of LED meals likely contributed to weight loss in the SW program. This study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov
as NCT02012426.

Introduction
According to the UK National Institute for Health and Care Ex-
cellence (NICE), more high-quality trials are needed to identify
effective components of weight-management programs (WMPs)
(1). One component that might facilitate weight loss is the
promotion of foods that are “satiety enhancing” or increase
feelings of fullness (2). As hunger is a main barrier to weight
loss attempts, targeting within- and between-meal satiety might
be an effective strategy to improve short-term appetite control
and long-term weight loss (3).
Low energy–dense (LED) foods contain fewer calories per
gram than do high energy–dense (HED) foods and tend to be

 higher in macronutrients that are important for satiation and
satiety (4, 5). Consuming LED preloads reduces hunger sensa-
tions and subsequent meal energy intake (EI) (6–8) compared
with HED preloads (8) or no preloads (6) in normal-weight,
overweight, and dieting individuals (6–9). The suppressant ef-
fect of LED meals on EI relative to HED foods has also been
demonstrated after consuming LED meals for 2 d in normal-
weight adults (10). Whether the effects of LED meals on satia-
tion and satiety sustain over time and translate into weight loss
is unclear (11–13).
Slimming World (SW), a widely available group-based com-
mercial weight loss program in the UK and Ireland, uses a num-
ber of evidenced-based behavior change techniques to target
eating and activity behaviors. The dietary component of the pro-
gram, termed “Food Optimizing,” advocates ad libitum intake
of many LED foods and controlled amounts of higher energy–
dense foods. The effect of this dietary approach on appetite and
EI has not been quantiied and it is important to understand
whether and how this program component may contribute to
the effectiveness of the WMP for weight loss. It is possible that
after following an LED diet for several weeks, compensatory
responses occur, such as increased physiological hunger (14) or
hedonic motivations for HED foods, which may result in greater
food intake or loss of compliance (15–17). Findings from previ-
ous research are mixed: one study indicated possible increased
compensatory intake after repeated consumption of LED foods
(18), but another did not (19).
SW has been shown to be broadly comparable to similar
commercial programs and slightly better than noncommercial
programs for weight loss (20). To date, SW has not been com-
pared with the self-led National Health Service (NHS) program,
which recommends an overall 600-kcal reduction in daily EI
within the context of general dietary and physical activity ad-
vice.
The primary aims of the current trial were to recruit women
recently enrolled on the LED-promoting SW program or a stan-
dard care (general calorie restriction) NHS Live Well program
(SC), and to examine the following: 1) the acute effects of LED
meals on subjective sensations of appetite (satiety), ad libitum
EI (satiation), hedonic cravings, and preferences for HED foods;
2) whether these acute effects diminish after a period of active
weight loss; or 3) following relatively greater consumption of
LED foods in the SW program.
The secondary aims of the trial were to compare changes in
body weight, body composition, and subjective experience of
the WMPs in terms of convenience, psychological deprivation,
control over eating, motivation, and ease of use (2).

Method
Female participants who were overweight or obese (n = 96) were re-
cruited from local Slimming World groups (SW) and the local commu-
nity (SC) between September 2014 and September 2015. Recruitment
emails and SW-group consultants were used to recruit newly enrolled
members. The SC participants were recruited through the use of email
distribution lists, University of Leeds recruitment databases (staff, stu-
dents, and the community), posters, online classiied adverts and so-
cial network sites. The SC participants were recruited to match the SW
group in terms of age, BMI, and willingness to engage in weight loss (as-
sessed at screening). Inclusion criteria were: female sex, aged 18–65 y,
BMI (in kg/m2) 28–45, interested in losing weight, able to eat the study
foods, and no increased physical activity in the past 4 wk. Exclusion
criteria were: confounding health problems, untreated hypothyroidism,
receiving systemic treatment, taking medications in the past month that
have effects on appetite or weight, received bariatric surgery, pregnant
(or planning), breastfeeding, known food allergies, a history of anaphy-
laxis to food, smokers, engaged in a commercial WMP in the preceding
2 mo, history of eating disorders, claustrophobia, worked in appetite
related-research, and unable to comply with trial procedures.
On the basis of previous research (21), power calculations estimated
that a power of 0.9 with a sample size of between 60 and 80 partici-
pants (30–40/group) would be suficient to give >95% probability of
detecting an effect of energy density on total within-day EI of 20–33%.
This sample size was also estimated to be suficient to detect the effect
of dietary program on weight and body composition between groups.
The study conformed to relevant sections of the Declaration of
Helsinki and was approved by the University of Leeds, School of Psy-
chology ethics committee. Participants provided informed consent and
upon completion received £250. The study was registered at clinicaltri-
als.gov as NCT02012426.
Design
Participants were recruited to a parallel group, nonrandomized, non-
blinded dietary intervention (SW, SC). The trial started with a 2-wk
run-in period followed by 12 wk of trial monitoring (total 14 wk). The
purpose of the run-in period was to ensure participants’ uptake and
commitment to the programs (22). Participants were not blind to the
WMP they were following, but were unaware that another trial group
was following an alternative WMP.
To assess satiation, food preferences, and satiety outcomes, a
randomized within-subjects crossover design with 2 conditions (LED,
HED) was used. Participants completed 4 probe days at the Human
Appetite Research Unit (HARU), where the effect of an LED diet
on satiation, satiety, and food hedonics was assessed at 2 time points
[weeks 3 and 4, repeated at weeks 12 and 13 (23)] (Supplemental Figure
1). The order of conditions was counterbalanced on the irst 2 probe
days and reversed for the last 2 probe days. Two time points were used
to examine the sustainability of effects. On probe days, participants
consumed a ixed breakfast and lunch meal and EI was assessed from
the evening ad libitum meal and snacks. Participants were unaware
about the nature and purpose of the energy density manipulation.
Body weight was assessed at weeks 1 and 14 and body composition
and health markers were assessed after the run-in period and at week
14 (measurement sessions). Weekly questionnaires assessed WMP ex-
perience: convenience, psychological deprivation of food, motivation,
satisfaction, and control over eating. Questionnaires were completed
outside the research unit with instructions to complete on the same day
and time each week.
Weight-Management Programs and Dietary Advice
SW, UK is a group-based approach that involves weekly meetings as
described in detail elsewhere (24). A central component of SW is a di-
etary approach that advocates ad libitum intake of LED foods within a
balanced diet. SW consists of weekly weigh-ins, group support sessions,
setting individual weight-loss goals, and access to online support (24).
The SW group were asked to follow the dietary advice and full program
provided by SW [for details, see (25)].

 Participants in the SC group were provided with a copy of the NHS
Live Well weight-loss program (26). This free, structured self-led pro-
gram recommends a daily reduction of 600 kcal [NICE guidelines, (27)],
provides weekly dietary and physical activity advice, and encourages
recording daily EI and physical activity and weekly body weight and
waist circumference (WC). Online support is also available. In terms
of dietary advice, the SC group was asked to follow the diet advice
from the weekly modules provided in the NHS Live Well program
[for details, see (26)]. To minimize any interference with the WMPs,
researchers referred participants to program resources when asked
for advice.
Study Measures
Subjective appetite sensations. Subjective sensations of hunger,
fullness, desire to eat, and prospective consumption (PC) were col-
lected with the use of 100-mm visual analogue scales (VASs) deliv-
ered through a portable device (28) [for speciic questions and re-
sponses, see (23)]. Ratings were obtained immediately before and after
every meal, before and after the Leeds Food Preference Questionnaire
(LFPQ), and at hourly morning and afternoon intervals. VASs have been
shown to be a valid and reliable method to assess subjective appetite
sensations (29).
Assessment of EI.
Test meals. The LED breakfast, lunch, evening meal, and evening
snacks were designed to be ≤0.8 kcal/g based on select recipes pro-
vided by SW. Comparable HED versions were designed that were
≥2.5 kcal/g. Breakfasts and lunches contained a ixed amount of
energy. Based on estimates of daily energy needs [assumed to be 1.4 ×
measured resting metabolic rate (RMR)] participants were allocated
to 1 of 3 bands, i.e., small, ≤2000–2500 kcal/d; medium, 2501–
3000 kcal/d; and large, ≥3001 kcal/d, and received a corresponding
portion size. As such, this method allowed for graded individual EIs. As
the participants were attempting weight loss, the total energy provided
allowed for a 20% (∼600-kcal)/d energy deicit. This provided energy
was distributed across the day as follows: breakfast, 20%; lunch, 30%;
evening meal, ∼30%; and snacks, ∼20%. All meals were prepared in
the HARU following standard operating procedures (foods sourced
from Sainsbury’s Supermarkets Ltd.) except for the LED evening meal
(chilli con carne) which was a SW recipe, batch prepared and supplied
by SW.
Breakfast and lunch ixed meals. The LED and HED breakfast
and lunch meals provided a ixed isocaloric portion that participants
were required to eat to entirety. For breakfast, the LED and HED meals
consisted of a cooked breakfast with a sweet side dish. Breakfast was
served with an optional tea or coffee (175 g water, plus optional 40 g
semiskimmed milk). The lunches were a baked potato meal with salad
and a sweet side dish (see Supplemental Table 1 for individual food
items). The LED breakfasts were lower in energy density and percent-
age of energy from fat and higher in weight (grams), percentage of en-
ergy from protein and carbohydrates, and grams of iber (Supplemental
Table 2).
Ad libitum evening meal and evening snacks. The LED and
HED evening meals were a beef-based chilli with sides and a sweet
dish (see Supplemental Table 1). The LED meal was lower in energy
density, percentage of energy from fat, and grams of iber, and was
higher in percentage of energy from protein and from carbohydrates
(Supplemental Table 2). Sweet and savory snacks were provided in
transparent containers for evening consumption outside the laboratory
(Supplemental Table 1). LED snacks were lower in energy density,
percentage of energy from fat, and grams of iber, and were higher in
percentage of energy from protein and from carbohydrates (Supplemen-
tal Table 2). Following each meal, participants rated meal palatability
based on appeal, pleasantness, and satisfaction with the use of
100-mm VAS.
Total daily EI (TDEI) and weight intake were determined by sum-
ming meals and snack intake.
Food preferences. The LFPQ (30) was used pre- and post-lunch
to measure implicit and explicit food preferences for HED and LED
foods. A full overview of the LFPQ method can be found elsewhere (30).
In short, the LFPQ provides measures of different components of food
preference and food reward. An array of food pictures were used that
were either LED or HED foods but similar in familiarity, protein con-
tent, sweet or nonsweet taste, and palatability. Responses were recorded
and used to compute mean scores for high-energy density, low-energy
density, sweet, or savory food types (and different fat-taste combina-
tions). To measure food liking participants rated the extent to which
they liked each food (“How pleasant would it be to taste this food
now?”). Food wanting was assessed with the use of a forced-choice
methodology in which the food images were paired so that every im-
age from each of the 4 food types (LED/HED, sweet/savory) is compared
with every other type over repeated trials (food pairs). Participants were
instructed to respond as quickly and accurately as possible to indicate
the food they wanted to eat the most at that time (“Which food do you
most want to eat now?”). Reaction times for all responses were covertly
recorded and used to compute mean response times for each food type
after adjusting for frequency of selection.
Cravings. At the end of each probe day, participants completed
VAS that assessed craving frequency (“How often have you experienced
food cravings today?”) and intensity (“How strong have any food crav-
ings been today?”). A food craving was deined to participants as an
intense desire to consume a particular food or drink that is dificult to
resist.
Changes in body weight, body composition, RMR, and
health outcomes. Body weight, week 1. Body weight was measured
on the irst day of the WMP with the use of electronic scales (SW group:
recorded as part of their irst weigh-in at an SW group meeting; SC
group body weight was recorded by a researcher at the HARU). Weight
was measured with shoes and heavy clothing removed. Height was mea-
sured at the HARU with shoes removed.
Body composition, waist and hip circumference, weeks 2 and 14.
Fat mass (kilograms), fat free mass (kilograms), and percentage of body
fat were measured by air displacement plethysmography (Bodpod, Con-
cord) (31, 32). A researcher measured WC and hip circumference (HC)
(centimeters) with a lexible nonmetal tape measure (when possible, the
same researcher measured WC and HC at weeks 1 and 14). WC was
measured (to the nearest 0.1 cm) at the participants’ navel at the end of
an exhalation. HC was measured at the participants’ widest circumfer-
ence (to the nearest 0.1 cm).
RMR. RMR was measured with the use of an indirect calorimeter
itted with a ventilated hood (GEM; Nutren Technology Ltd.) (33) with
participants awake and lying supine for 40 min. RMR was calculated
from respiratory exchange data according to the “modiied” Weir equa-
tion (34). RMR was used to determine the meal bands provided on
probe days.
Resting blood pressure, heart rate, and fasting blood glucose. Systolic
and diastolic blood pressure and resting heart rate were measured in the
supine position following 40 min of rest with the use of an Omron M10-
IT digital blood pressure cuff.
A inger-prick blood sample was collected from participants and as-
sessed with the use of a YSI 2300 STAT PLUS Glucose and Lactate Ana-
lyzer. For WC and HC, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate,
and fasting blood glucose, 2 measures were recorded and the average
was used.
Subjective experiences of the WMPs. Participants rated the program
through the use VAS for satisfaction, contentedness, convenience, ease
of use, ability to adhere to food choices, feeling in control over eating,
motivation to continue, enjoyment losing weight, lexibility, feeling de-
prived of favorite foods, and urges to discontinue the program (“How
satisied are you with your program?”; “How convenient do you ind
your program?”; “How easy do you ind it to stick to your program?”;
“Have you felt able to stick to your plan regarding your food choices?”;
“How much do you feel in control of what you’re eating?”; “How mo-
tivated are you to continue with your program?”; “How enjoyable do
you ind losing weight with your program?”; “How lexible do you ind
the program”; “Generally, how deprived of your favorite foods have
you felt?”; and “Have you felt the urge to rebel and abandon your pro-
gram?”).
Diet composition. To check dietary compliance, participants com-
pleted a 7-d weighed food diary at weeks 3 and 12. Electronic scales

 and training were provided to ensure detailed descriptions, and con-
sumed weights of foods and beverages were reported. Energy density
was calculated from the contribution of all food and milks (excluded
all other drinks) (total EI divided by total weight intake) based on cri-
teria previously used (35).
Procedure
Measurement sessions. Participants were instructed to fast from
2200 the night before, avoid alcohol the day before, and maintain simi-
lar levels of physical activity prior to sessions. Compliance was checked
upon arrival. Body composition, RMR, blood pressure, fasting blood
glucose, and psychometric traits (36) were then measured.
Probe days. Standardized control instructions were provided and
compliance was checked upon arrival at the HARU. All meals and
snacks were weighed pre- and post-consumption (to the nearest 0.1 g) to
determine weight of food consumed. Food consumption was converted
to EI according to the values provided from UK food composition tables
(37) and manufacturers’ nutritional information.
Strategy for Data Analysis
All appetite and weight outcome data were analyzed with the use
of SPSS version 24 for Windows (IBM Corp). WISP 4.0 (Tinuviel
Software 2013) was used to analyze food diary data. A chi-square
test was conducted to compare attrition rates across groups. To com-
pare differences between groups at baseline, a series of independent t
tests were conducted. For primary outcomes (appetite, EI, food prefer-
ences, and cravings), mixed ANOVAs were conducted with group (SW,
SC) entered as a between-subjects factor. For meal palatability values,
mixed ANOVAs were conducted on appeal, pleasantness, and satisfac-
tion scores, with condition and week as repeated-measures factors and
group as a between-subjects factor. Signiicant interactions were ex-
plored with t tests based on condition averages for weeks 3 and 12.
For secondary outcomes (weight, body composition, and health mark-
ers), analyses were conducted on participants who completed the trial
(completers analyses) and on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis with the
use of last observation carried forward (LOCF) for missing data (38)
(carrying a baseline observation forward resulted in the same outcomes
for weight change though with smaller effects). Mixed ANOVAs were
conducted to examine main effects and interactions between week and
group on body weight and body composition. ANCOVAs were con-
ducted on percentage of weight change controlling for starting body
weight. For WMP experience, weeks 3–12 were selected and compared
across week and group through the use of mixed ANOVAs. In all
analyses, unless stated, condition × group and week × group interac-
tions are reported for comparisons between groups across conditions
and weeks.
All signiicance values P < 0.05 are reported. Signiicant interactions
were explored with post-hoc analyses based on t tests unless stated, and
a more conservative α level was set to control for multiple tests (adjusted
based on the number of post-hoc comparisons; for brevity, signiicant
interactions with nonsigniicant post-hoc tests are not reported). Data
are presented as means ± SEs (95% CI: lower, upper) unless speciied.
Partial eta squared (η2) is reported for effect sizes and interpreted as:
small, 0.01; medium, 0.06; large, 0.14 (39).
Results
Participants
In total, 96 participants were recruited (SW n = 49) (Figure 1).
Attrition rates were similar across groups (P > 0.05). There
were no differences in baseline measures between completers
and those who withdrew or were excluded from the study
(P > 0.05).
At weeks 1 and 2, the SW and SC groups did not differ in
age, BMI, body weight, fat mass, fat-free mass, WC, HC, resting
blood pressure, or fasting blood glucose (Table 1).

Subjective sensations of appetite
Hunger, desire to eat, PC, and fullness proiles are shown in Sup-
plemental Figure 2. Hunger, desire to eat, and PC were lower
at every time point on the LED days than on the HED days
[ŋp² = 0.22, P < 0.001] with the exception of prebreakfast and
postevening meal, whereas fullness was signiicantly higher at
every time point throughout the day with the exception of pre-
breakfast [ŋp² = 0.22; P < 0.001]. Responses did not differ be-
tween groups or weeks (all P > 0.05).
Ad libitum evening meal, ad libitum snack intake,
and total-day EI (kilocalories and grams)
Compared with the HED days, on LED days participants con-
sumed signiicantly less energy from the evening ad libitum
meal [LED: 611 ± 25 kcal (562, 661 kcal); HED: 1219 ±
50 kcal (1112, 1318 kcal), ŋp² = 0.79; P < 0.001] and snacks
[LED: 307 ± 18 kcal (271, 343 kcal); HED: 757 ± 64 kcal

 (36%) under LED conditions compared with HED conditions
[mean TDEI: LED: 1901 ± 38 kcal (1826, 1975 kcal); HED:
2958 ± 97 kcal (2764, 3152 kcal), ŋp² = 0.74; P < 0.001].
For weight consumed, participants consumed 236 ± 21 g
more of the LED evening meal compared with the HED evening
meal [LED: 753 ± 31 g (692, 813 g); HED: 517 ± 20 g (478,
556 g), ŋp² = 0.62; P < 0.001]. There were no signiicant
differences between conditions in snack weight intake [LED:
225 ± 17 g (191, 260 g); HED: 206 ± 17 g (171, 240 g),
ŋp² = 0.01; P > 0.05]. Total-day weight intake was 1212 ±
29 g greater under LED conditions than under HED conditions
[LED: 2301 ± 43 g (2216, 2386 g); HED: 1089 ± 30 g (1029,
1149 g), ŋp² = 0.96; P < 0.001]. EI and weight intake did not
differ across groups or weeks [ŋp² = 0.02; P > 0.05].
Despite consuming less energy from the LED evening meal,
participants rated the LED evening meal as more appealing,
pleasant, and satisfying (P < 0.03) than the HED evening meal
(Supplemental Table 3).
Food preferences: explicit liking and implicit wanting
for LED and HED foods
Prelunch, liking for all foods was lower under LED condi-
tions than under HED conditions (ŋp² = 0.28, P < 0.001).
Across both conditions, from pre- to postlunch, liking decreased
for all foods (ŋp² = 0.77; P < 0.001). However, liking for
all foods reduced to a greater degree after the LED lunch
compared with the HED lunch [LED: −28.49; HED; −17.34,
ŋp² = 0.28; P < 0.001]. This reduction in liking following the
LED lunch was speciically greater for HED foods than for LED
foods (signiicant condition × time × energy density interaction,
ŋp² = 0.11, P < 0.01). Overall liking for food did not differ be-
tween groups or between weeks (P > 0.05).
In the LED condition, mean wanting for HED foods was
lower at prelunch compared with the HED condition (signii-
cant diet × time × food type interaction on wanting, ŋp² = 0.08,
P < 0.05). In the LED condition, wanting for HED foods was
signiicantly lower in the SW (−3.81 ± 2.89 RT/freq) than in
the SC group (0.97 ± 3.01 RT/freq) as qualiied with a signii-
cant group × condition × food type interaction on wanting for
high-fat foods, ŋp² = 0.11, P < 0.01. Wanting for HED foods
in the HED condition did not differ between groups or weeks
(P > 0.05).
Cravings
For the SC group, craving frequency and intensity did not sig-
niicantly differ between the LED and HED probe days. For the
SW group, however, craving frequency and intensity were lower
on the LED probe days than on the HED probe days [frequency:
SC: LED: 23.3 ± 4.2 mm (14.9, 31.8 mm); HED: 31.3 ± 4.3 mm
(22.6, 39.9 mm); SW: LED: 17.8 ± 3.2 mm (11.4, 24.3 mm);
HED: 43.3 ± 4.6 mm (33.9, 52.8 mm); intensity: SC: LED:
24.7 ± 3.6 mm (17.6, 31.8 mm); HED: 34.1 ± 4.4 mm (25.3,
42.9 mm); SW: LED: 19.3 ± 3.8 mm (11.7, 26.8 mm); HED:
41.9 ± 4.7 mm (32.6, 51.2 mm), ŋp² = 0.06; P < 0.05). Craving
frequency and intensity did not differ across weeks (ŋp² < 0.01;
P > 0.05).
Effects of WMP on changes in weight, body
composition, and health markers
Changes in weight between week 1 and week 14. Table 2
shows mean changes in weight, body composition, and health
markers for LOCF and completers analyses. Weight loss was sig-
niicant for both groups (P < 0.001). The SW group lost more
weight than the SC-group [the loss remained signiicant when
controlling for baseline body weight (P < 0.05)]. The SW were
more likely to lose clinically signiicant amounts of weight loss
(>5%) than the SC group [χ: χ(1) = 6.69, P < 0.05] (Supple-
mental Figure 3).
Changes in body composition. For changes in body compo-
sition, data were missing for 13 completers (SW: n = 6) because
a technical failure meant the BodPod could not be used at both
time points to measure body composition. The body composi-
tion of a further 4 participants was measured at both time points
by bioelectrical impedance (model BC418MA, Tanita) and due
to consistency these data were included in the analyses (included
as a covariate in the analysis). As such, data reported for com-
pleters was for a sample size of 65 (SW: n = 31). The SW group
lost more fat mass and greater percentage of fat than the SC
group (LOCF analyses were not signiicant) and this remained
signiicant when controlling for starting fat mass (P < 0.05).
Fat-free mass did not change between weeks for either groups.
WC and HC reduced in both groups (P < 0.01), though this
reduction did not differ between groups.
Changes in RMR and health markers. RMR signiicantly de-
creased in the SW group but did not change in the SC group.
Fasting blood glucose decreased in both groups (P = 0.005),
this reduction did not differ between groups. Systolic and di-
astolic blood pressure and resting heart rate did not change in
either group (Table 2).
Experiences of the WMP. The average response rate to
weekly questionnaires was 84.8% ± 27.2%. The SW group felt
the WMP was easier to stick to, felt more in control over their
eating and food choices, experienced more enjoyment as they
lost weight, were more satisied, and were more motivated to
continue the program compared with the SC group (Table 3).
There were no differences between groups on rated convenience,
urges to rebel and abandon the WMP, lexibility, or feeling de-
prived of favorite foods (Table 3).
Diet composition. The food diaries showed that at both time
points (weeks 3 and 12) the SW group’s diet was less energy–
dense than the SC group’s diet [week 3: SW: 1.14 kcal/g
(4.78 kJ/g), SC: 1.51 kcal/g (6.33 kJ/g); week 12: SW: 1.27 kcal/g
(5.33 kJ/g), SC: 1.56 kcal/g (6.54 kJ/g), p < 0.001].
Discussion
The current indings demonstrate the utility of LED meals
for reducing subjective sensations of appetite and meal EI in
overweight or obese women during active weight loss. The ef-
fects of LED meals were sustained following a 14-wk WMP,
which included either a dietary component that promotes ad
libitum intake of LED foods (Slimming World, UK), or a stan-
dard care WMP based on national guidelines for weight loss.
The SW program was associated with greater reductions in
weight and fat mass, and greater ease, enjoyment, satisfaction,
and motivation to continue with the program compared with
SC. Despite differences in weight outcomes, there were no dif-
ferential effects of the WMPs on appetite sensations or EI in
response to LED compared with HED foods as measured in the
laboratory. Both WMPs resulted in reduced fasting blood glu-
cose and no increases in blood pressure.
The LED meals increased sensations of fullness and reduced
hunger, desire to eat, and PC throughout the day. This resulted in

lower TDEI. These indings correspond with previous research
which reported reduced EI in normal-weight women after con-
suming LED meals for 2 d (10) and extend these indings to
women who were engaged in a weight-loss program.Reduced EI
occurred without increasing hedonic wanting or subjective crav-
ings. This novel inding is important because energy-reducing di-
ets can lead to increases in the reinforcing value of food (40) and
the appeal of high-fat foods (41). As such, an LED diet appears
to be effective in reducing EI while limiting hedonic motivations
and promoting dietary control, at least over the time window of
the study.
The indings suggest that the effects of LED meals on satia-
tion and satiety were sustained after following an LED diet for
12 wk (based on probe-day assessments at week 12). Thus, ad-
herence to an LED diet offers a potentially effective strategy to
assist weight loss by promoting satiation and satiety. Adherence
to an LED diet may help limit the effect of physiologic changes
that weaken satiety and promote weight regain subsequent to
weight loss (42). Indeed, previous research has reported an as-
sociation between LED diets and lower increases in the hunger
hormone ghrelin in response to weight loss (43). Future research
should examine gut peptide responses to acute and more pro-
longed consumption of an LED diet to understand the potential
for physiological responses to lead to compensation or loss of
compliance in the long term.
Despite lower EIs, weighed intake of the ad libitum LED
meal was higher compared with HED conditions. LED foods
may exert a constraining effect on caloric compensation (44,
45). LED foods may also induce greater satiation and satiety
due to increased oral processing times (46), altered gut hor-
mones (47), cognitive factors (8), and higher intake of protein
and iber (4, 5). It is important to note that in this study, the
LED and HED meals varied not only in the energy density but
also in weight, fat, protein, carbohydrates, and grams of iber.
It is likely that the effects observed are due to a combination
of these varying nutritional properties of LED meals and not
energy density alone. This study used a whole-diet approach
rather than isolating a speciic nutrient, and this allowed us to
use meals that relect those consumed by individuals engaged in
weight loss.
These indings support previous research documenting the
effectiveness of commercial behavior change programs for
weight loss (24, 48–58). Most of this evidence is from 12-wk
free primary care partnership schemes (20, 48, 49, 53, 54).
Similar results have been reported in regular fee-paying pro-
grams (24, 50). The current study extends these indings by
demonstrating the effectiveness of SW for weight loss and
changes in body composition compared with the SC program
in women who self-referred to a weight-loss program. The ind-
ings, along with previous research, suggest that evidence-based
structured programs are more effective for weight and fat loss
than self-led approaches [e.g. (52)].
The current trial also examined experiential aspects of the
commercial WMP. The SW group felt more in control over
what they were eating and abler to comply with food choices
than did the SC group, which is consistent with the appetite
and eating behavior responses exhibited by the sample over-
all in response to the LED probe days in the laboratory. The
SW group experienced greater satisfaction, enjoyment, and mo-
tivation to continue, suggesting that the SW may have been
be easier for people to follow and adhere to compared with
an SC approach, although it is not possible to specify which
program components led to these differences in overall program
evaluation.
The present study used a nonrandomized, parallel groups de-
sign, which may limit the certainty of some indings (59). How-
ever, the 2 groups were matched at baseline in terms of age,
motivation to lose weight, eating behavior traits (in prepara-
tion), body composition, and health measures. Nevertheless, an
issue with the nonrandomized design is that participants’ body
composition, health markers, and appetite measures were not
assessed before starting the program. Although this issue does
not affect weight change (recorded at weeks 1 and 14), it is im-
portant to consider that initial enrolment in the program might
have minimized the opportunity to observe differences between
groups on these outcomes.

The trial did not address long-term outcomes and it is well es-
tablished that there is a tendency for weight to be regained after
6 mo, at least in ITT models (60). The focus of the current re-
search was to understand the mechanisms of LED meals on ini-
tial weight loss. However, given that weight loss maintenance is
frequently the greater challenge (61), more trials should test the
effects of LED strategies on long-term weight loss maintenance.
Although not demonstrated in the time frame used in this study,
it is possible that after following an LED diet for a sustained
period, individuals learn to associate the sensory properties of
LED meals with low energy and compensate by increasing por-
tion size or seeking higher energy–dense foods (17, 18). Thus,
it would be useful to repeat this study and compare responses
to LED meals after initial enrolment and sustained engagement
(e.g., 1 y) in an LED program.
Additionally, although the SW and SC groups were generi-
cally similar in the advice given, they differed considerably in
the speciic dietary recommendations, mode of delivery, inten-
sity, peer-group support, and implementation strategies. This

 study primarily focused on the effects of speciic dietary advice
provided and how that may have inluenced eating behavior in
the laboratory. It is unlikely that the group difference in weight
change was entirely ascribable to dietary factors alone. Thus,
the effects should not be overestimated or extrapolated to other
program components that differed (62). The present study also
did not use speciic behavior change taxonomies to characterize
and compare how speciic program characteristics may have af-
fected weight outcomes (63). Nevertheless, despite these limita-
tions, it remains highly plausible that within a multicomponent
program, the promotion of LED meals can contribute to im-
proved appetite control and weight management.
In summary, this study provided the irst evidence that LED
meals delivered in the context of weight loss reduce subjective
appetite and hedonic motivations to eat, increase control over
eating, and reduce TDEI compared with HED meals. These ef-
fects were sustained after prolonged engagement in 2 different
WMPs. Promoting consumption of LED meals is likely to con-
tribute to the signiicant weight loss and reductions in fat mass
observed in women following the SW program.
