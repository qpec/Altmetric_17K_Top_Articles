Cannabis is the most commonly used illicit drug worldwide. Although its use is
associated with multiple adverse health effects, including the risk of developing
addiction, recreational and medical cannabis use is being increasing legalized. In
addition, use of synthetic cannabinoid drugs is gaining considerable popularity and is
associated with mass poisonings and occasional deaths. Delineating factors involved
in cannabis use and addiction therefore becomes increasingly important. Similarly to
other drugs of abuse, the prevalence of cannabis use and addiction differs remarkably
between males and females, suggesting that sex plays a role in regulating cannabinoid
sensitivity. Although it remains unclear how sex may affect the initiation and maintenance
of cannabis use in humans, animal studies strongly suggest that endogenous sex
hormones modulate cannabinoid sensitivity. In addition, synthetic anabolic-androgenic
steroids alter substance use and further support the importance of sex steroids in
controlling drug sensitivity. The recent discovery that pregnenolone, the precursor of
all steroid hormones, controls cannabinoid receptor activation corroborates the link
between steroid hormones and the endocannabinoid system. This article reviews the
literature regarding the influence of endogenous and synthetic steroid hormones on the
endocannabinoid system and cannabinoid action.

INTRODUCTION
Drug use causes considerable harm because of premature death and disability as well as other
adverse health effects. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime estimated that around
0.6% of the world population suffers from substance use disorders (United Nations Office on
Drugs and Crime [UNODC], 2017). Although opioids are considered the most harmful drugs
for their addiction potential and negative consequences, cannabis use is a much larger problem
when it comes to the number of users. Around 183 million “
past-year”cannabis users were
reported worldwide in 2015, which is 2.6 times higher than the cumulative number of “
past-year”
worldwide users of opioids, amphetamines and cocaine, making cannabis the most widely used
illicit drug at a global level (United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime [UNODC], 2017). Although
worldwide cannabis use has remained stable (3.4% in 1998 versus 3.8% in 2015), the absolute
number of cannabis users has increased because of the growing world population, especially
in Africa and Asia (United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime [UNODC], 2017). Legalization
of marijuana for medical and recreational purposes might increase cannabis use even further

Cannabinoid Signaling and Steroid Hormones
(Hopfer, 2014). In addition to traditional marijuana use,
the use of synthetic cannabinoids (i.e., designer drugs that
mimic the physical and psychological effects of delta-9-
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary active constituent in
cannabis) is gaining considerable popularity. Since 2008, when
the first synthetic cannabinoid (JWH-018) was detected in the
market, at least 169 different synthetic cannabinoids have been
discovered (Fattore and Fratta, 2011; European Monitoring
Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction [EMCDDA], 2017). The
emergence of synthetic cannabinoids is becoming an increasing
concern because of their undetermined addiction potential and
adverse health effects (Fattore, 2016; Weinstein et al., 2017; De
Luca and Fattore, 2018; Zanda and Fattore, 2018).
Acute toxicity of traditional cannabis use is considered low
(Nahas, 1972); yet, long-term cannabis use is associated with
serious adverse health effects which include lower birth weight
of offspring (maternal cannabis smoking), diminished lifetime
achievement, development of psychosis, depression or anxiety,
symptoms of chronic bronchitis, motor vehicle accidents, and
risk of cannabis addiction (Hall and Degenhardt, 2009; Volkow
et al., 2014; United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime
[UNODC], 2017). Although the existence of cannabis addiction
was disputed in the 1990s, current evidence predicts that around
1 in 10 cannabis users will develop cannabis addiction or
dependence (Lopez-Quintero et al., 2011), which is currently
defined as cannabis use disorder (CUD) in the fifth edition of
the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (5th
ed.; DSM-5; American Psychiatric and Association, 2013). CUD
is characterized by high cannabis intake over longer periods
of time, problems with controlling cannabis use, tolerance,
withdrawal signs, craving and negative effects on personal, social
and occupational activities (DSM-5).
The demand for CUD treatment is increasing dramatically.
The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction
reported a 50% increase in the number of first-time entrants
for CUD treatment in 2011 (European Monitoring Centre for
Drugs and Drug Addiction [EMCDDA], 2013). The increasing
need for CUD treatment is thought to be driven by the
increased availability of cannabis products containing higher
concentrations of THC or synthetic cannabinoids (Freeman and
Winstock, 2015). Regrettably, current CUD treatment protocols
show modest effects only (Budney et al., 2007; Weinstein and
Gorelick, 2011). Delineating risk factors involved in the initiation
and maintenance of cannabis use therefore becomes increasingly
important and critical for optimizing evidence-based prevention
and treatment protocols.
Similarly to other drugs of abuse, cannabis use differs
remarkably between males and females (European Monitoring
Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction [EMCDDA], 2005),
indicating a different sensitivity to cannabinoid-induced effects
in the two sexes (Davis and Fattore, 2015; Figure 1). Although it
remains uncertain which specific biological (i.e., sex) and socio-
cultural (i.e., gender) factors affect cannabis use in humans,
animal studies strongly suggest the involvement of sex (Fattore
and Fratta, 2010) and anabolic-androgenic steroids (AAS)
hormones (Struik et al., 2017) as important modulators of
cannabinoid sensitivity. This review aims to describe the role of
FIGURE 1 | Male to female ratios of lifetime cannabis use (CU) and
progression toward cannabis use disorder (CUD) among students
(15–16 years) and adults (European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug
Addiction [EMCDDA], 2005). Although males have a higher risk of developing
CUD (Zhu and Wu, 2017), progression toward CUD is faster in females (Khan
et al., 2013).
sex differences in cannabis use with reference to the modulating
role of sex and AAS hormones (Figure 2) in cannabinoid
sensitivity.
RISK FACTORS FOR CANNABIS USE
As for other drugs of abuse, both genetic and environmental
factors play a role in cannabis use and addiction (Agrawal and
Lynskey, 2006; Verweij et al., 2010). Twin studies estimate that
the genetic contribution to cannabis use is between 17 and 67%,
while the genetic contribution to cannabis addiction is much
higher and ranges from 45 to 78% (Verweij et al., 2010; Vink
et al., 2010; Distel et al., 2011; Lynskey et al., 2012). Interestingly,
the genetic contribution to the initiation of cannabis use increases
with age (Distel et al., 2011) and is higher in males than in females
(van den Bree et al., 1998). Although it is clear that genetics is
an important risk factor in cannabis use and abuse, it has so
far proved difficult to identify specific gene variants that alter
cannabis sensitivity. At present, most genome-wide association
studies (GWAS) failed to detect significant associations between
cannabis use and genetic variants (Agrawal et al., 2011; Verweij
et al., 2013; Stringer et al., 2016). However, using gene-based
testing, four genes that are significantly associated with lifetime
cannabis use have been recently identified, which include the

Cannabinoid Signaling and Steroid Hormones
FIGURE 2 | Chemical structures of the main male and female sex hormones
and the anabolic-androgenic steroid nandrolone. The strict chemical
homology with a common core cyclic structure among natural and synthetic
steroids accounts for the relatively high cross-reactivity displayed by sex
steroids and AAS at receptor level. The only difference between testosterone
and nandrolone (19-nortestosterone) is the methyl group (CH3) of nandrolone
in position C19 instead of the hydrogen (H) of testosterone, which increases
the anabolic activity of nandrolone and is at the basis of its use as a doping
drug (see Busardò et al., 2015 and references enclosed).
neural cell adhesion molecule 1 (NCAM1), the cell adhesion
molecule 2 (CADM2), the Short Coiled-Coil Protein (SCOC) and
the potassium sodium-activated channel subfamily T member 2
(KCNT2) (Stringer et al., 2016). Interestingly, NCAM1 has been
associated with substance abuse (Gelernter et al., 2006) and is
part of the NTAD gene cluster (NCAM1-TTC12-ANKK1-DRD2)
which is linked to neurogenesis and dopaminergic signaling
(Yang et al., 2008). In the most recent GWAS, single-nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) in novel antisense transcript RP11-
206M11.7, solute carrier family 35 member G1, and the CUB and
Sushi multiple domains 1 gene were significantly associated with
cannabis dependence (Sherva et al., 2016). However, whether or
not these genes contribute to altered cannabinoid action remains
unclear. Next to genetic variation, epigenetic-dependent changes
in gene expression might contribute to altered cannabinoid
sensitivity. Interestingly, a recent study reported increased DNA
methylation of the NCAM1 gene in cannabis users compared to
control subjects (Gerra et al., 2018).
The vulnerability to initiation of cannabis use and CUD
development appears heritable. Yet, numerous social and
environmental factors (e.g., age of cannabis use initiation,
peer drug use, availability of drugs, low socio-economic status,
experience of childhood sexual abuse, cigarette smoking or
alcohol drinking during early adolescence) and the presence of
pre/comorbid psychopathology (e.g., mood disorders, ADHD,
psychosis) are thought to enhance the risk of transitioning
from initiation of cannabis use to CUD (reviewed in Courtney
et al., 2017). Personality/biological traits, such as impulsivity,
schizotypy and sensation-seeking, are also positively correlated
with the initiation of cannabis use in adolescents and young
adults (Haug et al., 2014; Muro and Rodríguez, 2015).
As for other drugs of abuse, the prevalence of cannabis
use differs remarkably between males and females (Figure 1;
European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction
[EMCDDA], 2005) and sex is considered an important risk
factor for cannabis use (Cooper and Craft, 2017). Among 15–
16-years-old students, lifetime cannabis use is higher in males
than in females and the male to female ratio (M/F) of lifetime
cannabis use increases even further among all adults (M/F:
1.25–
4.0) (European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug
Addiction [EMCDDA], 2005). Although males have a higher risk
of developing CUD (Zhu and Wu, 2017), progression toward
CUD is slightly faster in females than in males (Khan et al., 2013;
European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction
[EMCDDA], 2017). Males also show different cannabis use
patterns as compared to females and appear to use cannabis more
frequently and at higher amounts (Cuttler et al., 2016). However,
a faster progression to problematic cannabis use (Cooper and
Haney, 2014) and more severe withdrawal symptoms (Levin
et al., 2010) could explain why women typically show greater
propensity to relapse to drug use than men (Becker and Hu, 2008;
Fattore et al., 2008).
The fact that differences in cannabis use between males
and females vary across countries suggests an influence of
environmental (i.e., socio-cultural) factors. However, animal
studies clearly indicate that biological factors, such as sex
hormones and chromosomes, are significant modulators of drug
sensitivity (Quinn et al., 2007; Marusich et al., 2015). In keeping
with this, gender-tailored detoxification treatments and relapse
prevention strategies for patients with CUD are increasingly
requested (Fattore, 2013).
SEX STEROID HORMONES
Sex differences arise because of differences in sex chromosomes.
The presence of the sex-determining region of Y (Sry) gene on the
Y chromosome induces testicular development and consequently
the production of testosterone (Polanco and Koopman, 2007).
Testosterone and its derivative dihydrotestosterone (DHT) are
responsible for the development of the male phenotype. Absence
of the Sry gene leads to the development of ovaries that
produce estradiol and progesterone. Estrogens, progesterone
and testosterone have a strong impact on sexual differentiation,
maturation and adult sexual behavior (Arnold and Breedlove,
1985; McEwen et al., 1987; Wallen, 1990; Meisel and Sachs, 1994;
Hull et al., 1999; Morris et al., 2004; Becker, 2009; Argiolas
and Melis, 2013; Motta-Mena and Puts, 2017). The presence
of sex hormones during development gives rise to various
organizational differences in the male and female brain, which
ultimately affect reproductive and non-reproductive behavior
(Beatty, 1979).
Sex hormones are synthesized by conversion of cholesterol
into pregnenolone, which is the precursor of all steroid hormones
(Hanukoglu, 1992). Interestingly, pregnenolone protects the
brain from cannabinoid type-1 receptor (CB1R) overactivation,

Cannabinoid Signaling and Steroid Hormones
by acting as a potent endogenous allosteric inhibitor of CB1Rs
(Vallée et al., 2014), and prevents cannabinoid-induced psychosis
in mice (Busquets-Garcia et al., 2017). Sex hormones can
be divided into three main subtypes with distinct molecular
functions and sexually dimorphic expression and distribution:
androgens
(e.g.,
testosterone,
dehydroepiandrosterone,
androstenedione),
estrogens
(e.g.,
17-alpha
and
17-beta
estradiol, estrone, estriol) and progestogens (e.g., progesterone,
allopregnanolone, pregnenolone) (Figure 2). Sex hormones are
produced by the gonads in response to the stimulating activity of
the pituitary gonadotropins whose release is, in turn, under the
control of the hypothalamic gonadotropin releasing hormone
(GnRH). At the central level, several neurotransmitters are
able to modify the release of GnRH, including norepinephrine,
dopamine, serotonin, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and
glutamate (Sagrillo et al., 1996). Cannabinoids were found to
significantly modulate the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-
gonadal (HPG) and -adrenal (HPA) axes (Brown and Dobs,
2002) and their interactions (Karamikheirabad et al., 2013).
Interestingly, sex hormones influence the action of cannabinoids
on these axes (Ló
pez, 2010) suggesting bidirectional interactions
between sex hormones and the endocannabinoid system
(Table 1).
The
main
molecular
targets
of
sex
hormones
are
members of the nuclear hormone receptor family, which are
ligand-activated transcription factors involved in the regulation
of gene expression (Mangelsdorf et al., 1995). Testosterone,
estrogen and progesterone target the androgen receptors
(ARα and ARβ), the estrogen receptors (ERα and ERβ) and
the progesterone receptor, respectively, although considerable
receptor “
promiscuity”
might exist in each case. Nuclear receptors
are ubiquitously expressed in the central nervous system (CNS),
including areas associated with reward and addiction (Bookout
et al., 2006). Besides transcriptional effects, sex hormones are also
reported to have fast non-genomic actions by modulating the
activity of G protein-coupled receptors (GPRCs), ion channels
and signaling proteins (Simoncini and Genazzani, 2003).
Sex hormones cause permanent organizational sex differences
that are fixed during early development but they also maintain
certain sex differences during the adult phase as long as these
hormones are present, i.e., induce activational effects (McCarthy
et al., 2012). For example, gonadectomy in adulthood completely
suppresses sexual behavior in males and receptive and proceptive
behaviors in females, all effects being reverted by exogenous
hormonal replacement (Micheal and Wilson, 1974; Mitchell and
Stewart, 1989; Jones et al., 2017). When released, sex hormones
are also able to deeply influence the organization and activity
of one of the most important target organs of hormonal action,
which is the brain (Arnold and Breedlove, 1985; McEwen and
Milner, 2017). Gonadal hormones thus provide a biological basis

Cannabinoid Signaling and Steroid Hormones
for sex differences in endocannabinoid-related behaviors and
are expected to contribute to the sexual dimorphic actions of
cannabinoids (Craft and Leitl, 2008; Craft et al., 2013).
SEX DIFFERENCES IN THE
ENDOCANNABINOID SYSTEM
The endocannabinoid system is an evolutionary conserved
signaling
system
that
modulates
multiple
functions
and
consists of cannabinoid receptors, endogenous ligands (i.e.,
endocannabinoids)
and
several
enzymes
involved
in
the
synthesis and degradation of endocannabinoids. The receptors
and endogenous ligands of the endocannabinoid system were
discovered in the late ‘
80s and early ’
90s, respectively. CB1Rs
are highly expressed in the brain (Tsou et al., 1998; Freund
et al., 2003; Howlett et al., 2004) and are considered the main
type of receptor mediating cannabinoid signaling in response
to exposure to THC (Moldrich and Wenger, 2000). CB1Rs
are also highly expressed in fat tissue which might explain
their role in energy homeostasis regulation, while cannabinoid
type-2 receptors (CB2Rs) are predominantly expressed in cells
of the immune system (van der Stelt and Di Marzo, 2005).
CB1Rs and CB2Rs are GPCR and can be activated by THC
or endogenous cannabinoid ligands like anandamide (AEA)
and 2-arachidonylglycerol (2-AG) (McPartland et al., 2007).
Activation of cannabinoid receptors results in the modulation
of several signals, including inhibition of adenylate cyclase,
activation of the MAPK pathway, stimulation of inwardly
rectifying K+ channels, and inhibition of voltage-activated Ca2+
channels. Ultimately, cannabinoid receptor activation modulates
the activity of most neurotransmitter systems, including GABA,
glutamate, dopamine, and serotonin (van der Stelt and Di
Marzo, 2003). The tonic 2-AG signaling at inhibitory inputs onto
dopamine neurons has been shown to differ between sexes (Melis
et al., 2013), supporting the notion that there are quantitative
differences in the endocannabinoid system in males and females
which likely contribute to altered cannabinoid sensitivity.
Noteworthy, several sex differences in the endocannabinoid
system are related to changes in steroid hormone levels and
activity.
Sex
hormones
can
affect
the
activity
of
several
neurotransmitters in the CNS, including the endocannabinoid
functioning (Nguyen et al., 2017; Moraga-Amaro et al., 2018),
and significant sex-dependent differences in CB1R density
and function have been described (reviewed in Antinori and
Fattore, 2017). In a pioneering work, Rodríguez de Fonseca
et al. (1994) investigated the expression of brain CB1Rs in
male and female rats under different hormonal conditions
and reported higher CB1R binding in males than females in
almost all the brain areas investigated (i.e., striatum, limbic
forebrain, and mesencephalon). Notably, CB1R binding in
males was not affected by gonadectomy and/or testosterone
replacement, while in females a strong sex hormone-dependent
modulation of CB1R expression was observed, with ovariectomy
increasing CB1R affinity in the striatum and decreasing CB1R
density in the limbic forebrain (Rodríguez de Fonseca et al.,
1994). González et al. (2000) found that males have higher
levels of CB1R-mRNA transcripts than females in the anterior
pituitary gland but that, in females, CB1R-mRNA transcripts
fluctuate during the different phases of the ovarian cycle with the
highest expression on the second day of diestrus and the lowest
expression on estrus. Based on these findings it was suggested
that higher levels of estrogen in the anterior pituitary gland
could serve to inhibit CB1R expression, reducing the inhibitory
endocannabinoid tone within the HPG axis around the time
of ovulation (Ló
pez, 2010). More recently, Castelli et al. (2014)
found that CB1R density was significantly lower in the prefrontal
cortex (PFC) and amygdala of cycling females compared to males
and ovariectomized (OVX) females, and that administration
of estradiol to OVX markedly reduced the density of CB1Rs
to the levels observed in cycling females. In addition, OVX
females displayed higher CB1R function in the cingulate cortex
compared to intact and OVX + estradiol females. Interestingly,
sex and estradiol also affected motor activity, social behavior and
sensorimotor gating (Castelli et al., 2014), which are behaviors
sensitive to the effects of different classes of drugs of abuse, in
line with the idea that females can represent a more vulnerable
phenotype (at neurochemical and behavioral level) than male
rats in developing addiction-like behaviors. In addition, estradiol
time-dependently modulates CB1R binding in brain structures
that mediate nociception and locomotor activity (Wakley et al.,
2014).
Besides impacting on CB1R expression, sex hormones regulate
the levels of endocannabinoids. Bradshaw et al. (2006), for
example, measured the levels of AEA and 2-AG in several brain
areas (i.e., pituitary gland, hypothalamus, thalamus, striatum,
midbrain, hippocampus, and cerebellum) in male rats and in
females at five different time points along the estrous cycle.
They found that AEA content was higher in females than
males in both the anterior pituitary gland and hypothalamus
(Bradshaw et al., 2006). With the exception of the cerebellum, all
brain regions examined revealed significant differences along the
estrous cycle in the level of at least one endocannabinoid, with
changes occurring predominantly within the 36-h time period
surrounding ovulation and behavioral estrus. In general, studies
on the regulatory role of sex hormones on the endocannabinoid
system failed to provide a clear and linear relationship between
the two, and rather showed that these relations are quite complex
and depend largely on the specific aspect considered (i.e., receptor
affinity or density), the specific endocannabinoid (i.e., AEA or 2-
AG) or the brain area investigated (Gorzalka et al., 2010; Gorzalka
and Dang, 2012). The interpretation of these findings is further
complicated by the fact that (i) all studies performed behavioral
testing and/or tissue and serum collection at different time points
after gonadectomy, (ii) animals were of different strains and
tested at different ages (although they were adult in all studies),
and that (iii) animals were kept under hormonal replacement
regimen for different periods of time (1 day–
3 weeks) before
testing. However, the following findings are consistent among
studies: (i) higher density of CB1Rs in male hypothalamus
and limbic areas coupled, in general, with lower levels of
endocannabinoids; (ii) there are significant differences along
the hormonal cycle of females, with major changes occurring

Cannabinoid Signaling and Steroid Hormones
in the expression of CB1Rs in pituitary gland, hypothalamus
and midbrain limbic structures when passing from diestrus to
proestrus and behavioral estrus.
Sex steroids, like estrogens, can also regulate the activity
of the endocannabinoid metabolizing enzymes. Fatty Acid
Amide Hydrolase (FAAH) is the main enzyme involved in the
degradation of AEA (Patel et al., 2017). The promoter region of
the FAAH gene contains an estrogen binding response element,
and translocation of the estrogen receptor to the nucleus results
in repression of FAAH transcription in vitro (Waleh et al., 2002)
and in vivo (Maccarrone et al., 2000). Ovariectomy prevents
the estrogen-induced down-regulation of FAAH expression, and
both progesterone and estrogen reduce basal levels of FAAH
(Maccarrone et al., 2000). The impact of estrogen-mediated
regulation of FAAH activity at behavioral and neurochemical
level is still under investigation (Hill et al., 2007).
In humans, plasma AEA levels fluctuate across the menstrual
cycle, with a peak at ovulation and the lowest plasma AEA
levels observed during the late luteal phase (El-Talatini et al.,
2010). In addition, significant positive correlations exist between
plasma levels of AEA and plasma levels of estradiol, luteinizing
(LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels (El-Talatini
et al., 2010). More recently, brain imaging studies revealed sex
differences in the endocannabinoid system. By using positron
emission tomography (PET) and the CB1R-selective radioligand
[(11)C]OMAR it was shown that CB1R availability is higher
in healthy females than in males (Neumeister et al., 2013;
Normandin et al., 2015). In addition, it was reported that
anandamide levels are lower in females than males (Neumeister
et al., 2013). Another study combined PET with the CB1R-
selective radioligand [18F]MK-9470 to examine CB1R binding in
healthy men and women (van Laere et al., 2008). In this study,
CB1R binding was higher in males than in females in all the
brain areas investigated and strongly increased with aging in
females, suggesting that age-dependent changes in the levels of
sex hormones can control CB1R binding in females (van Laere
et al., 2008).
While some of the sexual dimorphisms in the brain
endocannabinoid system might be permanent, cannabinoid
sensitivity is not fixed and can be acutely modulated by
hormone-dependent fluctuations of CB1R density, levels of
endocannabinoids
and
of
endocannabinoid
metabolizing
enzymes. Collectively, the hormone-driven sexual dimorphic
endocannabinoid system provides a biological basis for sex
differences in endocannabinoid-related behaviors, including
reward-related behavior (Fattore and Fratta, 2010; Fratta and
Fattore, 2013).
SEX DIFFERENCES IN CANNABINOID
ACTION
Numerous studies show sex differences in functions in which the
endocannabinoid system is involved, which span from regulation
of motivated behaviors, like sex activity (Gorzalka et al., 2010;
Ló
pez, 2010; Androvicova et al., 2017) and food intake (Farhang
et al., 2009), to locomotor and exploratory activity (Craft and
Leitl, 2008; Craft et al., 2017), nociception (Tseng and Craft,
2001; Craft et al., 2017), working memory (Crane et al., 2013),
anxiety (Viveros et al., 2011; Bowers and Ressler, 2016) and
vulnerability to develop addictive disorders (Fattore et al., 2014;
Marusich et al., 2014; Becker, 2016). Endocannabinoids are also
directly involved in the anxiolytic effects of estrogen; in turn,
estrogen may elicit changes in emotional behavior through an
endocannabinoid mechanism (Hill et al., 2007).
Sexual maturation takes place under hormonal control during
puberty and adolescence. Due to the deep changes occurring
during these periods of life, individuals of both sexes are
particularly (although differentially) sensitive to many stimuli,
vulnerable toward the development of psychopathological
conditions and more prone to abuse drugs, including cannabis
(Wiley and Burston, 2014; Silva et al., 2016; Wagner, 2016).
Exposure to cannabinoids during critical developmental periods
alters several functions in adult animals (Schneider, 2008; Rubino
and Parolaro, 2016), including working (Schneider and Koch,
2003; O’
Shea et al., 2004) and spatial memory (Rubino et al.,
2009), sensorimotor gating (Schneider and Koch, 2003), anxiety
and anxiolytic-like responses (Biscaia et al., 2003; O’
Shea et al.,
2004; Viveros et al., 2005b), anhedonia, depressive-like states
(Schneider and Koch, 2003; Rubino et al., 2008) and sexual
behavior (Chadwick et al., 2011). Long-term alterations induced
by cannabinoids in the developing organism are well known
(Gupta and Elbracht, 1983; Navarro et al., 1994; Pistis et al.,
2004; Viveros et al., 2005a; Spano et al., 2006; Ellgren et al.,
2007; Renard et al., 2014; Rubino and Parolaro, 2016; Melas
et al., 2018) and recent reports are pointing out epigenetic
mechanisms underlying cannabis action (Szutorisz and Hurd,
2016, 2018; Prini et al., 2017). Yet, researchers started only
recently to unravel sexually dimorphic long-term effects of early
cannabinoid exposure on behavior, cognition and emotional
states (Viveros et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2014; Keeley et al., 2015a,b).
For instance, the ability of sex hormones to affect cannabinoid
self-administration was established only recently. Such a delay
is probably due to the fact that human cannabis use is
extremely difficult to model in laboratory animals (Panlilio
et al., 2010) and that the development of reliable protocols
of cannabinoid self-administration in mice (Martellotta et al.,
1998), rats (Fattore et al., 2001) and monkeys (Justinova et al.,
2003) has taken long time and efforts. Importantly, these
models made it possible to investigate factors that modulate
spontaneous cannabinoid intake in animals, including strain
(Deiana et al., 2007) and sex (Fattore et al., 2007, 2010).
Notably, female rats are able to discriminate THC from
vehicle at a lower dose and faster rate than male rats (Wiley
et al., 2017), although no significant sex differences were
observed in the cannabinoid place preference test (Hempel
et al., 2017). Moreover, ovarian hormones were identified
as important modulators of cannabinoid self-administration,
since bilateral ovariectomy significantly reduced drug-taking
and drug-seeking in female rats (Fattore et al., 2007, 2010).
Unfortunately, which specific sex hormone is able to finely
modulate cannabinoid intake is still uncertain, highlighting the
need for studies that combine gonadectomy with hormone
replacement.

Cannabinoid Signaling and Steroid Hormones
The effects of hormonal fluctuation during the menstrual
cycle on the responses to drugs of abuse have been consistently
investigated (Terner and de Wit, 2006; Carroll et al., 2015;
Weinberger et al., 2015). Yet, the influence of sex hormones
and menstrual cycle on the subjective and objective effects of
marijuana has only been occasionally studied in female smokers.
For example, Griffin et al. (1986) found no effect of the specific
phase of the menstrual cycle on marijuana intake, a finding
consistent with the negative results reported by Lex et al. (1984)
which monitored cannabis-induced changes in pulse rate and
mood in women during the follicular, ovulatory and luteal phases
of the cycle. These earlier studies, however, failed to detect
strong hormonal-dependent effects of marijuana intake along the
menstrual cycle, and more controlled studies are needed before
reaching any definitive conclusion on hormonal influences on
cannabinoid use and sensitivity.
(ENDO)CANNABINOIDS, SEX
HORMONES AND DOPAMINE
Sex hormones have been found to be important modulators of
several drugs of abuse (Lynch et al., 2000; Carroll et al., 2004;
Fattore et al., 2007, 2008; Lynch, 2008; Carroll and Lynch, 2016;
Swalve et al., 2016). Estradiol and progesterone rapidly induce
changes in dopaminergic signaling within the dorsal striatum and
nucleus accumbens of female rats (Becker, 1999), effects that are
important for the regulation of normal physiological states and
relevant reproductive behaviors (Yoest et al., 2018). While the
enhancing effect of ovarian hormones on drug craving has been
traditionally attributed to estrogens (even in view of their ability
to elicit direct dopamine release in the brain), it was suggested
that progesterone, rather than estradiol, is responsible for the
reducing effect on drug-seeking behavior (Feltenstein and See,
2007; Feltenstein et al., 2009; Carroll and Lynch, 2016).
As discussed above, brain CB1R distribution, synthesis of
endogenous cannabinoids and activity of enzymes involved in
cannabinoid metabolism (turnover) are significantly affected by
sex hormones. At systems level, hormone-dependent differences
and fluctuations in cannabinoid function may directly affect
the activity of brain neurotransmitters and structures involved
in cognitive and emotional aspects of motivated behaviors
(Schultz, 1997; Berridge and Robinson, 1998; Ikemoto and
Panksepp, 1999; Salamone and Correa, 2002; Goto and Grace,
2005; Cheng and Feenstra, 2006; Di Chiara and Bassareo, 2007;
Berridge et al., 2009), like feeding (Melis et al., 2007; Bassareo
et al., 2015; Fois et al., 2016; Coccurello and Maccarrone,
2018; Contini et al., 2018) and sexual behavior (Pfaus et al.,
1990; Pfaus and Everitt, 1995; Sanna et al., 2015, 2017) as
well as psychopathological states (Dunlop and Nemeroff, 2007;
Maia and Frank, 2017) and addiction-like behaviors (Everitt
and Robbins, 2005, 2016). Such a modulation can happen (i)
by a direct interaction of the cannabinoid system with the
mesolimbic dopaminergic system, the core component of the
neurobiological substrates at the basis of motivated behavior
(Gardner, 2005; Fadda et al., 2006; Lecca et al., 2006; Zangen
et al., 2006; Melis and Pistis, 2007; Panagis et al., 2014; Bloomfield
et al., 2016; Maldonado et al., 2006), or (ii) by indirect actions
in limbic areas (e.g., hippocampus, amygdala, PFC) strictly
interconnected with mesolimbic dopaminergic neurons through
(mainly) glutamatergic projections to the ventral tegmental area
and nucleus accumbens (Laviolette and Grace, 2006; Laviolette,
2017). Sex hormones can modulate cannabinoid influence on
motivated behaviors and stress responses by acting also at the
level of several hypothalamic nuclei (Cota, 2008).
The
leading
hypothesis
that
sex
steroids
and
(endo)cannabinoid actions can converge on the dopaminergic
mesolimbic system to regulate important motivational aspects in
a sexually dimorphic manner deserves further confirmation. To
date, it explains interactions of cannabinoids and sex hormones
only at the level of specific brain systems, while most of the
information at molecular and genetic/epigenetic level are still
missing, although initial efforts in this direction have begun to
fill the gap (see for example Mani et al., 2001; Gammon et al.,
2005; Szutorisz and Hurd, 2016, 2018; Prini et al., 2017; Rosas
et al., 2018). Furthermore, this hypothesis takes into account
almost exclusively the cannabinoid effects mediated by central
CB1Rs, but CB2Rs may also play a part through their actions on
brain dopamine systems (Liu et al., 2017). The importance of sex
hormones in modulating drug sensitivity is further supported by
studies that have shown a clear association between exposure to
synthetic male steroids and drug sensitivity.
ANABOLIC-ANDROGENIC STEROIDS
AND CANNABINOID ACTION
Anabolic-androgenic steroids are synthetic derivatives of the
male hormone testosterone and are used therapeutically for
the treatment of various diseases including hypogonadism,
angioedema, anemia, osteoporosis, and muscle wasting (Basaria
et al., 2001). Non-medical use of AAS is often observed among
professional and non-professional athletes in order to improve
physical appearance and enhance performance (Sagoe et al.,
2014). Global lifetime prevalence rate of non-medical AAS use
is estimated to be 3.3% (Sagoe et al., 2014). AAS doses used for
non-medical purposes are typically much higher (10–
100×) than
doses for medical use and are associated with several physical and
psychological side effects (Hartgens and Kuipers, 2004). Physical
side effects that have been observed after use of AAS include
infertility, baldness, breast development, severe acne, high blood
pressure, blood clots, heart attack, and stroke (Hartgens and
Kuipers, 2004). Possible psychological consequences of AAS use
are increased aggression, anxiety, and depression (Hartgens and
Kuipers, 2004). Clinical and epidemiological data show that AAS
are often co-abused with addictive substances, including cannabis
(DuRant et al., 1995; Arvary and Pope, 2000; Kanayama et al.,
2003). Several reasons might explain why polypharmacy occurs
in more than 95% AAS users (Parkinson and Evans, 2006).
First, AAS users are known to take other drugs to counteract
adverse side but they might also have a higher sensitivity toward
substance abuse. Alternatively, AAS might have direct effects
on various components of the brain reward system which
alters the sensitivity of users toward other drugs of abuse.

Struik et al.
Cannabinoid Signaling and Steroid Hormones
Use of high doses of AAS can lead to addiction, which
makes it conceivable that AAS are able to modulate the brain
reward system (Kanayama et al., 2009). Although part of the
rewarding effects of AAS might be derived from their effects on
physical appearance, animal studies have shown that testosterone
and other AAS can induce conditioned place preference in
a dopamine receptor-dependent manner (Arnedo et al., 2000;
Schroeder and Packard, 2000; Parrilla-Carrero et al., 2009)
and increase self-administration behavior (Clark et al., 1996;
Wood, 2004). In addition to their effects on reward-related
behavior, AAS cause molecular and neurochemical changes in the
dopaminergic, serotonergic and opioid neurotransmitter systems
(Johansson et al., 1997; Kindlundh et al., 2001; Zotti et al.,
2014) and alter the behavioral effects of different types of drugs
(Kurling, 2008; Kurling-Kailanto, 2010; Kailanto, 2011).
Studies
investigating
the
effects
of
AAS
exposure
on
cannabinoid sensitivity are scarce at present. It was shown
that testosterone significantly reduces THC-induced locomotor
suppression or catalepsy in gonadectomized males (Craft and
Leitl, 2008; Craft et al., 2017) and that chronic exposure to
nandrolone, a derivative of testosterone also known as 19-
nortestosterone (Figure 2), blocked THC-induced conditioned
place preference in rats (Célérier et al., 2006). Further, we recently
reported that chronic treatment of rats with nandrolone does
not alter CB1R levels or function in several reward-related
brain areas. However, when chronic nandrolone treatment is
followed by cannabinoid self-administration, we observed a
strong decrease in CB1R function in the hippocampus and
a significant increase in cannabinoid intake (Struik et al.,
2017). Given the profound effects that AAS have on various
aspects of the molecular machinery of the brain reward
system, it might come as no surprise that AAS also interfere
with the rewarding properties of drugs of abuse, including
cannabinoids.
Altogether, studies available so far suggest that AAS can
have a repressing effect on the brain reward system, a notion
that is strengthened by the observation that AAS reduce drug-
induced neurochemical and behavioral effects of amphetamine,
MDMA, THC, and cocaine, and increase voluntary alcohol and
cannabinoid drug intake (Mhillaj et al., 2015). The hypothesized
AAS-induced suppression of the reward system might result in
the use of higher doses of drugs, which is associated with a higher
addiction risk. It would be intriguing to find out to what extent
blockade of steroid hormone activity contributes to prevent the
repressive effect of these hormones in the reward system. Further
studies are needed also to assess whether or not AAS can act as
gateway drugs and lead to CUD and to better understand how
they can impinge upon the endocannabinoid signaling within the
brain.
CONCLUSION
Cannabis is the most commonly used illicit drug worldwide and
its use is associated with multiple adverse health effect including
the risk of addiction. Identifying factors involved in cannabis use
and abuse is critical for optimizing evidence-based prevention
and treatment protocols. Similarly to other drugs of abuse, the
prevalence of cannabis use and addiction differs between males
and females, suggesting that sex is an important modulator
of cannabinoid sensitivity. Accumulating evidence shows that
the endocannabinoid system is sexually dimorphic and that
sex hormones play a key role. Hormone-driven differentiation
of the endocannabinoid system seems to provide a biological
basis for sex differences in endocannabinoid-related behaviors,
including reward-related behaviors. While sex differences in
cannabinoid action are being increasingly studied in animals,
controlled human studies are still limited. The endocannabinoid
system is, for its intrinsic characteristics, a privileged target of the
actions of both sex and anabolic-androgenic steroid hormones
at different levels and, in turn, it can modulate the activity
of sex hormones (Table 1). The observation that exposure to
AAS causes dysfunction of the brain reward pathway in rats
points to a potential risk factor for initiation of cannabis use,
maintenance of regular use and development of CUD. The cross
talk between endocannabinoid signaling and steroid hormones
can occur differently in males and females, and many questions
about underlying mechanisms remain unanswered, demanding
further research in the field in an attempt to elucidate the basis of
the sex differences often observed in cannabinoid sensitivity.
