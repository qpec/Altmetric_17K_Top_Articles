Abstract
The molecular processes that determine the outcome of influenza virus infection in humans are 
multifactorial and involve a complex interplay between host, viral, and bacterial factors1. 
However, it is generally accepted that a strong innate immune dysregulation known as ‘cytokine 
storm’ contributes to the pathology of infections with 1918 H1N1 pandemic or highly pathogenic 
avian influenza viruses (HPAIV) of the H5N1 subtype2–4. The RNA sensor Retinoic acid-
inducible gene I (RIG-I) plays an important role in sensing viral infection and initiating a 
signalling cascade that leads to interferon (IFN) expression5. Here we show that short aberrant 
RNAs (mini viral RNAs; mvRNAs), produced by the viral RNA polymerase during the replication 
of the viral RNA genome, bind and activate RIG-I, and lead to the expression of interferon-β. We 
find that erroneous polymerase activity, dysregulation of viral RNA replication, or the presence of

 avian-specific amino acids underlie mvRNA generation and cytokine expression in mammalian 
cells. By deep-sequencing RNA samples from lungs of ferrets infected with influenza viruses we 
show that mvRNAs are generated during infection in vivo. We propose that mvRNAs act as main 
agonists of RIG-I during influenza virus infection.
The negative sense viral RNA (vRNA) genome segments of influenza A viruses, as well as 
the complementary RNA (cRNA) replicative intermediates, contain 5′ triphosphates and 
partially complementary 5′ and 3′ termini that serve as the viral promoter for replication 
and transcription of the viral RNA genome6. RIG-I has been shown to bind and be activated 
by the dsRNA structure formed by the termini of influenza virus RNAs7,8. However, it 
remains unclear how RIG-I gains access to this dsRNA structure. Both vRNA and cRNA are 
assembled into ribonucleoprotein complexes (vRNP and cRNP, respectively) in which the 
viral RNA polymerase, a complex of the viral proteins PB1, PB2 and PA, associates with the 
partially complementary termini, while the rest of the RNA is bound by oligomeric 
nucleoprotein (NP)6 (Fig. 1a). The tight binding of the 5′ and 3′ termini of vRNA and 
cRNA by the RNA polymerase9 is likely to preclude an interaction with RIG-I. Moreover, it 
has been demonstrated that IFN expression is triggered only in a fraction of influenza virus 
infected cells10,11, suggesting that influenza viruses efficiently hide their genome segments 
during infection by replicating them in the context of RNPs11. This led to the proposal that 
an aberrant RNA replication product might be binding to RIG-I and triggering IFN 
expression12. The influenza virus polymerase is known to generate defective interfering 
(DI) RNAs, which are ≥178 nt long subgenomic RNAs generated during high multiplicity 
infections13, and small viral RNAs (svRNAs), which are 22-27 nt long and correspond to 
the 5′ end of vRNA segments. However, svRNAs have been shown not to be involved in the 
induction of antiviral cellular defences14 and DI RNAs assemble into RNP structures (Fig. 
1a), as demonstrated for a 248 nt long DI RNA15, potentially precluding their interaction 
with RIG-I. Therefore, it remains unclear what kind of viral RNA species is recognised by 
RIG-I (Fig. 1a) and why different influenza virus strains trigger dramatically different levels 
of IFN expression2,3,16.
Engineered viral RNAs shorter than 149 nt but containing both the 5′ and 3′ termini of 
vRNAs can be transcribed and replicated by the viral polymerase in the absence of NP17, 
suggesting that they do not form canonical RNP structures. We call these short viral RNAs 
mvRNAs (Fig. 1a). To investigate which class of viral RNA is responsible for triggering IFN 
expression, we expressed a full-length segment 4 vRNA (1775 nt long) or its truncated 
versions, a 245 nt long DI RNA and 77 nt long mvRNA, in HEK 293T cells together with 
viral polymerase and NP and measured the activation of the IFN-β promoter (Fig. 1b). We 
found that the expression of mvRNAs induced significantly higher IFN expression than full-
length vRNA or DI RNA, comparable to the levels induced by transfection of 2 μg of 
poly(I:C), a known activator of IFN expression18. Similar results were obtained with 
segment 5 and 6 vRNAs and their truncated DI RNA and mvRNA versions (Fig. 1b). To 
determine the optimal mvRNA length that triggers IFN-β promoter activation, we expressed 
47 to 246 nt long vRNAs derived from segment 5 together with viral polymerase and NP and 
measured the activity of the IFN-β promoter. We found that the replication of 56 to 125 nt

 long mvRNAs resulted in significantly higher IFN-β promoter activity than the replication of 
RNAs shorter than 56 nt or longer than 125 nt (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 1a,b).
To address whether these engineered short mvRNAs triggered IFN expression via RIG-I, we 
co-expressed viral RNAs with polymerase and NP in HEK 293T RIG-I knockout or control 
cells engineered to express luciferase in response to the activation of the IFN-β promoter. 
We found that 56 to 125-nt long mvRNAs induced only background levels of luciferase in 
RIG-I knockout cells, even though the expression of RIG-I or transfection of poly(I:C) 
resulted in significant activation of the IFN-β promoter (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 1c). 
By contrast, significant levels of luciferase activity were detected in wildtype cells (Fig. 1d). 
mvRNAs of 56 to 125 nt induced the strongest activation of the IFN-β promoter, in 
agreement with the data above (Fig. 1c,d and Supplementary Fig. 1c,d). To address whether 
mvRNAs trigger the activation of IFN-β expression through binding to RIG-I, we 
immunoprecipitated myc-RIG-I from cells expressing RNAs of 47 to 583 nt. We observed 
that mvRNAs of 56 to 125 nt were specifically enriched in RIG-I immunoprecipitates (Fig. 
1e and Supplementary Fig. 1e). No mvRNAs were detected in the myc-EGF negative control 
immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1e). To test if mvRNAs also activate RIG-I, we incubated purified 
myc-RIG-I with an in vitro transcribed 76 nt mvRNA and measured 32Pi release. We found 
that a triphosphorylated 76 nt mvRNA induced higher levels of ATPase activity than a 
dephosphorylated 76 nt mvRNA, while no ATPase activity was observed when we incubated 
a RIG-I mutant with the triphosphorylated 76 nt mvRNA (Supplementary Fig. 1f,g). Overall, 
these results demonstrate that mvRNAs longer than 47 and shorter than 125 nt are bound by 
RIG-I, which results in RIG-I activation and the induction of IFN-β expression. This is in 
agreement with findings that reconstitution of full-length influenza virus vRNPs leads to 
only low levels of IFN expression unless the cells are pre-treated with IFN19 and the 
hypothesis that aberrant replication products trigger the IFN induction cascade12.
We next asked whether mvRNAs are made during influenza virus infection. We infected 
HEK 293T cells with influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) (abbreviated as WSN) and analysed 
viral RNAs by RT-PCR of segment 1, RT-PCR of all segments using universal primers, or 
deep-sequencing of the total small RNA fraction (RNAs 17 to 200 nt in length) 
(Supplementary Fig. 2a,b). We found only very low levels of mvRNAs and, consistently, 
observed no significant IFN expression (Fig. 2a,b). We hypothesised that mvRNAs are only 
generated as a consequence of dysregulated viral RNA replication. To test this, we 
overexpressed viral RNA polymerase prior to infection to generate an imbalance between 
polymerase and NP levels, which is known to induce innate immune signalling20. Under 
this condition we found significantly higher levels of mvRNAs and IFN expression, while 
simultaneous overexpression of NP and polymerase reduced mvRNA and IFN production 
(Fig. 2a). We verified the identity of mvRNAs using gel isolation and Sanger sequencing 
(Supplementary Fig. 2c) as well as deep sequencing (Fig. 2b). We found that the majority of 
mvRNAs were derived from the PB1-, HA-, NP- and NA-encoding vRNA segments (Fig. 
2c) and that mvRNAs had a size distribution with a peak around 55 to 64 nt (Fig. 2d and 
Supplementary Fig. 2d). In addition to mvRNAs, we also identified complementary mini 
viral RNAs (mcRNAs).

 Analysis of mvRNA sequences suggests that mvRNAs are generated via an intramolecular 
copy-choice mechanism that tolerates 3' mismatches or skipped bases (Fig. 2e,f). The 
generation of mvRNAs can be explained by the separation of the template and nascent 
product RNAs by backtracking21, followed by template translocation until base pairing 
between template and nascent product RNA is re-established (Fig. 2f,g). This process may 
be induced by an imbalance between viral polymerase and NP levels (Fig. 2a and 
Supplementary Fig. 3a).
In humans, infection with the 1918 H1N1 pandemic virus or H5N1 HPAIV lead to strong 
innate immune activation2,3,16. To address whether mvRNAs could contribute to this 
phenomenon, we investigated the replication of a 246 nt RNA by the polymerase of these 
viruses. We found that the polymerases of the highly virulent A/Brevig Mission/1/18 
(H1N1) (abbreviated as BM18) pandemic virus and the A/duck/Fujian/01/02 (H5N1) 
(abbreviated as FJ02) HPAIV generated higher levels of mvRNAs than the polymerases of 
WSN and A/Northern Territory/60/68 (H3N2) (abbreviated as NT60) viruses, even in the 
presence of high NP concentrations (Fig. 3a). No mvRNAs were observed in a control with 
an inactive WSN polymerase that had two point mutations in the polymerase active site 
(PB1a). We confirmed that the mvRNAs produced by the BM18 polymerase were similar to 
the WSN mvRNAs (Supplementary Fig. 3b). Isolation of total RNA from cells expressing 
polymerase of the BM18 or FJ02 virus and its subsequent transfection into HEK 293T cells 
resulted in significantly higher IFN-β promoter activity compared to when RNA from cells 
expressing WSN, NT60, or active site mutant WSN PB1a polymerase was transfected (Fig. 
3a).
The identification of mismatches during the generation of mvRNAs (see Fig. 2e) suggests 
that mvRNA production might be dependent on polymerase fidelity. To investigate this 
further, we introduced a V43I mutation, which has been shown to confer high-fidelity on an 
H5N1 influenza virus polymerase22, into the PB1 subunit of the BM18 polymerase 
(BM18hf). We found that mvRNA levels were significantly reduced in the presence of 
BM18hf, with a corresponding reduction in IFN-β promoter activity (Fig. 3a). Together, the 
observations in Fig. 2a, Fig. 3, and Supplementary Fig. 3a suggest that dysregulation of viral 
RNA replication, e.g. by limiting NP availability, and replication by HPAIV polymerases in 
mammalian cells generates mvRNAs by employing an error-prone copy-choice mechanism, 
such as proposed for recombination in positive-strand RNA viruses23.
We next asked whether a particular BM18 polymerase subunit is the determinant of mvRNA 
production and replaced individual polymerase subunits of the BM18 polymerase with 
subunits of the WSN polymerase in the 246 nt RNA replication assay. We found that 
particularly replacement of the BM18 PB2 subunit with the WSN PB2 subunit eliminated 
the generation of mvRNAs (Supplementary Fig. 4a). Interestingly, the BM18 influenza PB2 
subunit has been linked to the enhancement of both the kinetics and the magnitude of the 
host response to viral infection, leading to the induction of strong inflammatory responses in 
the lungs of infected mice24. To identify PB2 amino acids involved in mvRNA formation, 
we aligned the BM18, WSN, NT60 and FJ02 PB2 sequences and found four amino acids 
that distinguish the BM18 and FJ02 polymerases from the WSN and NT60 polymerases: 9 
(D→N), 64 (M→T), 81 (T→M), and 661 (A→T) (Supplementary Fig. 4a). Each of these

 amino acids has been implicated in avian to mammalian host adaptation25 and, interestingly, 
all three N-terminal PB2 adaptive amino acids map to the template exit channel of the RNA 
polymerase (Fig. 3b)6. We generated single mutations N9D, T64M, M81T, and double 
mutations N9D+T64M and N9D+M81T in the PB2 subunit of the WSN polymerase and 
found that mutants N9D and M81T and the double mutants N9D+T64M and N9D+M81T 
significantly increased mvRNA formation (Fig. 3c) and IFN-β promoter activity (Fig. 3c,d). 
However, the levels of mvRNAs generated by these mutants did not reach the levels 
generated by the BM18 polymerase indicating that further amino acids contribute to 
mvRNA production. In line with our observations, WSN viruses that contain a PB2 N9D 
substitution or other PB2 mutations near the template exit channel have been reported to 
induce higher IFN-β expression than wild-type WSN26,27.
To address whether mvRNAs form during infection of mammalian cells, we infected A549 
cells with WSN, the highly pathogenic avian strain A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1) (abbreviated 
as VN04), and the VN04 virus with the PB1 V43I high-fidelity mutation (abbreviated as 
VN04hf). Infections with VN04 resulted in high levels of mvRNAs, while WSN infections 
produced only very low levels (Fig. 4a). Infections with VN04hf resulted in significantly 
reduced mvRNA levels compared to the wild-type VN04 virus. These results demonstrate 
that mvRNAs are formed during influenza virus infection of lung epithelial cells and that 
polymerase fidelity is an important determinant of mvRNA formation (Fig. 4a).
To investigate whether there is a link between mvRNA production and virus-induced innate 
immune responses we performed RNAseq of cells infected with VN04 and VN04hf viruses 
and examined which genes were differentially expressed in response to mvRNA levels. 
Despite significantly different mvRNA levels produced by VN04 and VN04hf, viral mRNA 
levels were similar (Supplementary Data 1), in agreement with previous findings that the 
V43I mutation has only a marginal effect on virus replication22. Gene Ontology (GO) 
analysis (Fig. 4b) showed that basic cellular functions were significantly compromised in 
VN04 infection relative to VN04hf, consistent with a greater level of cell death, which is 
known to exacerbate inflammation28. In addition, we observed that genes associated with 
innate immune responses showed a significant increase in expression in response to higher 
mvRNA levels (Fig. 4b). Overall, these observations are indicative of a link between 
erroneous polymerase activity, mvRNA synthesis, and innate immune activation and the 
induction of cell death. Furthermore, as VN04 exhibited a 10-fold higher lethality compared 
to V04hf in mice22, our data also suggest a link between mvRNA levels and virulence.
To address whether mvRNAs are produced in infection of animal models, we analysed RNA 
samples from ferret lungs one and three days after infection with highly pathogenic avian A/
Indonesia/5/2005 (H5N1) (abbreviated as IN05), 2009 swine-origin pandemic A/
Netherlands/602/2009 (H1N1) (abbreviated as NL09) or the BM18 pandemic virus29,30. 
mvRNAs were present in all infected lung samples one day after infection, with mvRNA 
levels particularly high in the BM18 infected ferret lungs (Fig. 4c, Supplementary Fig. 5). 
GO analysis on the ferret lung samples taken one and three days post infection, showed an 
up-regulation of apoptosis and innate immune responses as function of mvRNA level, 
independently of viral titre or the day post infection (Fig. 4d).

 In summary, we identify mvRNAs, a class of influenza virus RNAs, that act as the main 
agonists of the pathogen recognition receptor RIG-I during influenza virus infection (Fig. 
4e). mvRNAs are produced as a result of aberrant replication of the viral RNA genome by 
the viral RNA polymerase. Polymerase fidelity and host-specific amino acids are 
determinants of the ability of the viral polymerase to produce mvRNAs, which are distinct 
from DI RNAs and full length viral RNA segments in that they can be efficiently replicated 
in the absence of NP and do not form canonical RNPs17. These features of mvRNAs are 
likely to be critical for their preferential recognition by RIG-I over DI RNAs and full-length 
RNA segments. We further demonstrate that mvRNA production is linked to increased 
cytokine expression and cell death. Our observations thus strongly suggest that mvRNAs are 
a contributing factor to influenza virus virulence. We speculate that production of high levels 
of mvRNAs by the polymerases of the 1918 pandemic and highly pathogenic avian 
influenza viruses and the resulting increased innate immune activation contribute to the 
cytokine storm phenomenon underlying the high virulence of these viral strains. The effects 
of mvRNAs are likely modulated by viral factors, such as the immunomodulatory NS1 and 
PB1-F2 proteins12 (Fig. 4e). Further studies are required to assess mvRNA levels generated 
by various influenza virus strains, including seasonal strains, and their effect on virulence.
Methods
Ethics and biosafety
All work with highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses in A549 cells was conducted in the Biosafety 
Level-3 laboratory at the LKS Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, under 
guidelines and ethics approved by the Committee on the Use of Live Animals in Teaching 
and Research (CULATR). Ferret experiments with IN05 and NL09 were described 
previously29 and conducted in the Biosafety Level-3 laboratory of the Erasmus Medical 
Centre in compliance with European guidelines (EU directive on animal testing 86/609/
EEC) and Dutch legislation (Experiments on Animals Act, 1997), after approval by the 
independent animal experimentation ethical review committee of the Netherlands Vaccine 
Institute (permit number 200900201). Ferret experiments with BM18 were described 
previously30 and approved by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Rocky 
Mountain Laboratories, National Institutes of Health, and conducted in an Association for 
Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care international-accredited facility 
according to the guidelines and basic principles in the United States Public Health Service 
Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and the Guide for the Care and Use 
of Laboratory Animals. Sample inactivation and shipment was performed according to 
standard operating procedures for the removal of specimens from high containment and 
approved by the Institutional Biosafety Committee.

 cells. Plasmids expressing mutant PB1a (D445A/D446A)34, and mutant PB2 (N9D)26, of 
influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) virus have been described previously. Full-length or internally 
truncated vRNAs were expressed from plasmids under the control of cellular RNA 
polymerase I promoter35. Luciferase reporter plasmid under the control of the IFN-β 
promoter (pIFΔ(-116)lucter), the β-galactosidase reporter plasmid (pJatLacZ) under the 
control of a constitutive promoter (β-gal), pcDNA-Myc-RIG-I expressing myc-tagged RIG-
I, and pcDNA-myc-proEGF have been described previously36,37. To construct plasmids 
expressing mutant PB1, PB2 proteins and myc-RIG-I (myc-RIG-I mut; which contains the 
mutations K851A, K858A and K861A), the plasmids expressing wild-type proteins were 
subjected to site-directed mutagenesis using the primers listed in Supplementary Table 1.
Cells and antibodies
Human embryonic kidney HEK 293T cells were originally sourced from the ATCC, stored 
in the Dunn School cell bank at the University of Oxford, and mycoplasma tested, but not 
authenticated prior to our experiments. A549 cells were originally sourced from the ATCC 
and cultured at the University of Hong Kong. Cells were cultured in DMEM (Sigma-
Aldrich) and 10% FCS. Western blots were performed using NP antibody GTX125989 
(GeneTex), Myc antibody GTX115046 (GeneTex), RIG-I antibody GTX85488 (GeneTex), 
and PB2 antibody GTX125926 (GeneTex). Wild-type and RIG-I knockout HEK 293T cells 
expressing luciferase in response to the activation of the IFN-β promoter were described 
previously38.
Statistical testing
In all figures, error bars indicate standard deviation with sample sizes as indicated in figures 
or figure legends. Evaluation of the statistical significance between group means was 
performed across all experiments according to the following criteria: (i) in the case where a 
comparison of a single variable was made between only two groups, an unpaired t-test was 
used; (ii) in the case of comparisons between three of more groups of measurements derived 
from a single independent variable (e.g. IFN-β induction as a function of RNA length), one-
way ANOVA was used and P-values were corrected for multiple comparisons using either 
Dunnett’s test (when a single group was taken as a reference/control to which all other 
groups were compared) or the Bonferroni method (when specific pairs of groups were 
compared to one another); (iii) in the case of comparisons between three of more groups of 
measurements derived from two independent variables (e.g. IFN-β induction as a function of 
RNA length and RIG-I expression), two-way ANOVA was used and P-values were corrected 
for multiple testing using the Bonferroni method; (iv) in the case of comparisons between 
three of more groups of log-distributed data (e.g. viral titres), measured values were first 
log10 transformed and then compared using one-way ANOVA, with P-values corrected for 
multiple comparisons by controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) to be <0.05 using the 
two-stage step-up method of Benjamini, Kreiger, and Yekutieli. For the evaluation of the 
statistical significance of the relationship between two measured values (e.g. fold increase in 
IFN-β induction vs. mvRNA level), linear regression analysis was used, with the P-value 
indicating the probability of the null hypothesis (no linear relationship), and the goodness of 
fit reported as r2. Statistical testing related to differential gene expression analysis is detailed

Prism.
RNP reconstitution assays and quantitative RNA analysis
RNP reconstitution assays were carried out in 24-well plates out as described 
previously34,39. Briefly, 0.25 μg of the plasmids pcDNA3-NP, pcDNA3-PB2, pcDNA3-
PB1, pcDNA3-PA, and a pPOLI plasmid encoding full-length or truncated vRNA templates 
(for list of vRNA templates used see Supplementary Table 2) were transfected into HEK 
293T cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions. Twenty-four hours post transfection, RNA was extracted using TRI Reagent 
(Sigma-Aldrich) and dissolved in RNase free water. For quantitative primer extensions, 
reverse transcription was carried out using SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Thermo 
Fisher Scientific) with 32P-labelled oligonucleotides complementary to vRNA-derived RNA 
species and ribosomal 5S rRNA (for primers see Supplementary Table 3). cDNA synthesis 
was stopped with 10 μl loading dye (90% formamide, 10 mM EDTA, xylene cyanole, 
bromophenol blue) and 32P-labelled cDNAs generated with primer NP- were resolved by 
12% denaturing PAGE (19:1 acrylamide/bis-acrylamide, 1x TBE buffer, 7 M urea). 32P-
labelled cDNAs generated with primer NP-2 were resolved by 20% denaturing PAGE. The 
radiolabelled signals were imaged using phosphorimaging on a FLA-5000 scanner (Fuji), 
and analysed using AIDA (RayTek) and Prism 7 (GraphPad). In all experiments, the 
apparent RNA levels were background corrected using the PB1 active site mutant (PB1a) 
signal and normalised to the 5S rRNA control. Statistical analysis of data from at least three 
independent experiments was carried out using ANOVA.
RNP reconstitution assays and qualitative RNA analysis
For segment-specific qualitative RNA analysis by RT-PCR, RNA was treated with DNase 
(Promega) for 10 min according to the manufacturer’s instructions and reverse transcribed 
using SuperScript III and the PB2 primers listed in Supplementary Table 3. cDNA was 
amplified using Q5 polymerase (NEB) and the primers listed in Supplementary Table 3. 
PCR products were analysed on 1.5% agarose gels in 0.5x Tris-acetate-EDTA (TAE) buffer. 
For qualitative RT-PCR using universal primers, DNase treated RNA was reverse transcribed 
using the Lv3aa and Lv3ga primers listed in Supplementary Table 3 and Superscript III at 37 
ºC for 30 min. Second strands synthesis was performed with primer Lv5 and Q5 polymerase 
(NEB) at 47 ºC for 10 min, followed by a further extension at 72 ºC for 3 min. The primer 
excess in the reactions was removed by incubating the second strand reaction with 1 U of 
exonuclease VII (NEB) at 37 degrees Celsius for 1 h. Following inactivation of the 
exonuclease at 95 ºC for 10 min, the DNA was amplified using Q5 polymerase, and primers 
P5 and i7 for 25 cycles. PCR products were analysed by 6% PAGE.
Luciferase-based interferon expression assays
For luciferase assays, RNP reconstitutions were performed in wild-type HEK 293T cells or 
HEK 293T cells engineered to express luciferase from the IFN-β promoter. RNP 
reconstitutions were performed in a 24-well format by transfecting 0.25 μg of the plasmids 
pcDNA3-NP, pcDNA3-PB2, pcDNA3-PB1, pcDNA3-PA, a pPOLI plasmid encoding full-
length or truncated vRNA templates using lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen). For RNP

 reconstitutions in wild-type HEK 293T cells, 100 ng of pIFΔ(-116)lucter and pJatLacZ were 
co-transfected with the polymerase expressing plasmids. Twenty-four hours post 
transfection, cells were harvested in PBS and resuspended in Reporter Lysis buffer 
(Promega). Luciferase activity was measured using a Luciferase Assay System (Promega) 
and a GloMax (Promega), and normalised using the β-galactosidase signal measured using 
ortho-Nitrophenyl-β-galactoside (ONPG) and a GloMax. The background was subtracted 
using signals obtained from cells transfected with an empty pcDNA3. Luciferase levels were 
corrected for viral RNA levels obtained with primer extensions and a 32P-labelled NP-2 
primer (Supplementary Table 3). For total RNA transfections, 100 ng of total RNA was 
transfected with 100 ng of pIFΔ(-116)lucter and pJatLacZ using Lipofectamine2000. 
Analysis of luciferase expression was performed as described above. Statistical analysis was 
carried out using ANOVA.
Immunoprecipitations
For myc-RIG-I immunoprecipitations, 10 cm dishes with HEK 293T cell were transfected 
with 3 μg pcDNA3-NP, pcDNA3-PB2, pcDNA3-PB1, pcDNA3-PA, pcDNA-myc-RIG-I or 
pcDNA-myc-EGF, and a pPOLI plasmid encoding either a full-length or truncated vRNA 
template using Lipofectamine 2000. Twenty-four hours post transfection, the cells were 
harvested in cold PBS and lysed in 600 μl Tris lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 5% 
glycerol; 0.5% Igepal; 200 mM NaCl; 1 mM EDTA; 1 mM DTT; and 1x EDTA-free 
protease inhibitor (Roche)) on ice for 1 h. The lysates were cleared at 10,000 g for 5 min. 
Six μg of anti-myc antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to 0.5 ml of cleared lysate and 
mixed at 4 ºC for 1.5 h. The lystate-antibody mix was bound to Dynabeads (Novex) at 4 ºC 
for 1.5 h, washed 3 times with IgG wash buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0; 150 mM NaCl; 
0.1% Igepal; 1 mM PMSF; 1 mM EDTA), and finally analysed for bound RNA and protein. 
Statistical analysis of data from three independent experiments was carried out using 
ANOVA.
ATPase assay
For wild-type and mutant myc-RIG-I purification, HEK 293T cell were transfected with 5 
μg pcDNA-myc-RIG-I or pcRNA-myc-RIG-I mut using Lipofectamine 2000. Twenty-four 
hours post transfection, the cells were harvested in cold PBS and lysed in lysis buffer (50 
mM Hepes, pH 8.0; 5% glycerol; 0.5% Igepal; 200 mM NaCl; 2 mM MgCl2; 10 mM CaCl2; 
1 mM DTT; 1 U/ml Micrococcal Nuclease (Thermo Scientific); and 1x EDTA-free protease 
inhibitor) on ice for 1 h. Three μg of anti-myc antibody was next added per 0.5 ml of cleared 
lysate and mixed at 4 ºC for 1.5 h. The lystate-antibody mix was bound to Protein G Mag 
Sepharose Xtra beads (GE Healthcare) at 4 ºC for 1.5 h, washed 6 times with 20 column 
volumes of RIG-I wash buffer (50 mM Hepes, pH 8.0; 200 mM NaCl; 0.1% Igepal; 5% 
glycerol; 1 mM PMSF; 2 mM MgCl2) at 4 ºC for 10 min, and finally myc-RIG-I was eluted 
from beads in 1 column volume wash buffer containing 0.5 mg/ml c-myc peptide (Pierce) 
for 15 min at 4 ºC. Activity assays were performed in 50 mM Hepes pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 
2 mM MgCl2, 5 mM DTT, and 0.1 μM [γ-32P]ATP. [γ-32P]ATP and 32Pi were resolved 
using PEI-cellulose TLC plates (Sigma-Aldrich) in 0.4 M KH2PO4 pH 3.4.

 Cell and animal infections
HEK 293T cells were infected with influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) virus, free of DI RNAs, at 
a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5. RNA was extracted 5 h post infection and analysed 
using deep sequencing or qualitative RT-PCR. 6-wells containing A549 cells were infected 
with A/WSN/33 (H1N1), A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1), or A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1) with 
the V43I mutation with an MOI of 5. RNA was extracted 8 hours post infection and 
analysed using deep sequencing or qualitative RT-PCR. Ferret (Mustela putorius furo) lung 
tissue was obtained from male ferrets infected with A/Indonesia/5/2005 (H5N1) or A/
Netherlands/602/2009 (H1N1)29, or female ferrets infected with A/Brevig Mission/1/1918 
(H1N1)30. Ferrets were randomly assigned to groups of four before inoculation. A single 
ferret (lung titre = 7.6×101 log10TCID50/g) was excluded from analysis on the basis of its 
apparent lack of infection. Ferret RNA was isolated from lung tissue samples using Trizol 
(Invitrogen) and analysed using qualitative RT-PCRs and next generation mvRNA 
sequencing with universal primers and quantitative mRNA sequencing.
Sequence alignment and structural modelling
PB2 amino acid sequences from influenza A viruses A/WSN/33 (H1N1), A/Brevig Mission/
1/18 (H1N1), A/Northern Territory/60/68 (H3N2), and A/duck/Fujian/01/02 (H5N1) were 
aligned using Muscle 3.0 and visualised using ESPript40. The bat influenza A virus 
polymerase structure (PDB 4WSB) was visualised in Pymol 1.6.
Next generation sequencing of mvRNAs using adapters
Total cell RNA from transfected or infected cells was isolated using Tri Reagent (Sigma) or 
Trizol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and fractionated into small 
(17-200 nt) and large (>200 nt) RNA fractions using an RNA Clean and Concentrator kit 
(Zymo Research). Next, the small RNA fraction was denatured at 70 ºC for 2 min and 
subsequently treated with 2 U of XRN-1 in NEB buffer 2 at 37 ºC for 15 min to deplete 
miRNAs. Next, XRN-1 was inactivated by adding 10 mM EDTA and incubating the reaction 
at 70 ºC for 10 min. Viral triphosphorylated RNAs were converted to monophosphorylated 
RNAs by adding 5 U of RNA 5' Pyrophosphohydrolase (RppH) and 10 mM MgCl2 and 
incubating the reactions at 37 ºC for 15 min. RNA was purified using an RNA Clean and 
Concentrator kit and libraries for deep sequencing were prepared using the NEBNext Small 
RNA Library Prep Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. To ensure accurate 
quantitation after PCR amplification, the concentration of each library was measured by 
qPCR on a StepOnePlus instrument (ABI) and the number of PCR cycles used to 
subsequently amplify the remaining library material was calibrated so as to ensure the PCR 
was in the early stage of exponential amplification and to not over-cycle the PCR reactions. 
Amplified sequencing libraries were purified on a 6% Novex TBE PAGE according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions to remove primer-dimers. Paired-end sequencing (2x75bp) on an 
Illumina HiSeq 4000 was carried out by the Oxford Genomics Centre, Wellcome Trust 
Centre for Human Genetics (Oxford, UK). It is important to note that the existence of 
mvRNAs has likely been overlooked till now, because i) RNA isolation protocols vary in 
their capacity to recover small RNAs, ii) RT-PCR products from mvRNAs form a diffuse 
fast-migrating band on standard agarose gels that may be mistaken for primer-dimers, iii)

 conventional RNA deep sequencing protocols discard short library fragments, and iv) 
standard ligation-based deep sequencing protocols do not detect viral transcripts with a 5′-
triphosphate group.
Next generation sequencing of mvRNAs using universal primers
To spike viral RNA for quantitative sequencing, 0.2 μl of 100 pM spike RNA 
(Supplementary Table 2) was added to 40 ng of the small RNA fraction (see above). The 
RNA mixture was next converted into cDNA using primers Lv3aa, Lv3ga and Lc3 and 
Superscript III (Invitrogen) at 37 ºC for 30 min. Second strand synthesis was performed 
using Q5 polymerase (NEB) and primers Lv5, Lc3a, and Lc3g at 47 ºC for 10 min, followed 
by a further extension at 72 ºC for 3 min. The excess of barcoded primers was removed by 
incubating the second strand reaction with 1 U of exonuclease VII (NEB) at 37 ºC for 1 h. 
The exonuclease was inactivated at 95 ºC for 10 min. Next, the DNA was amplified using 
Q5 polymerase, primer P5 and i7 index primers (Lexogen), and subsequently sequenced on 
a NextSeq 500 sequencer (Illumina).
Preparation of reference genome files for deep sequencing of mvRNAs
Prior to mapping, a reference genome file was prepared from relevant viral reference 
sequences in Genbank (see above). For the analysis of sequencing libraries prepared using 
universal influenza virus primers, the 5′ and 3′ viral promoter sequences of each segment 
were modified to match the degenerate universal primer sequences used in sample 
preparation (see Supplementary Table 3), and the sequences of the spiked-in mvRNA 
quantitation standards (see Supplementary Table 2) were appended to the reference genome. 
For WSN, VN04, and VN04hf viruses, deep-sequencing data of mRNA generated in A549 
cell infections (above) was exploited to generate updated reference genome files: the 
mpileup and consensus commands in the bcftools software package41 were used following 
mapping of non-host mRNA reads to the relevant viral reference genome using STAR 
aligner42.
Data processing pipeline for deep sequencing of mvRNAs using universal influenza virus 
primers
Raw sequencing reads were first trimmed to remove sequencing adaptor sequences and 
reads with quality scores less than 20 using the cutadapt software package43 and the 8-nt 
unique molecular identifier (UMI) at the start of each read were removed from the sequence 
and appended to the read ID line of the FASTQ file using the extract command from the 
umi_tools software package44. Sequencing reads were then mapped end-to-end to the 
appropriate viral reference genome using the STAR aligner42, and permitting sequencing 
reads to have long internal deletions (i.e. an mvRNA, interpreted as splicing by STAR) with 
at least 16 nt anchored on either side of the deletion (--outSJfilterOverhangMin 16 16 16 
16). The default settings of STAR were modified so that no alignment scoring penalty was 
given for an internal deletion and no preference was given to internal deletions that 
overlapped particular sequence motifs (--scoreGapNoncan 0 --scoreGapGCAG 0 --
scoreGapATAC 0), and to ensure accurate quantitation, only the top-scoring alignment was 
included in the outputted BAM file (--outSAMmultNmax 1), which was sorted and indexed 
using samtools45. An aligned read was counted as an mvRNAs if it was anchored to the

 viral reference genome at the 5′ end in vRNA sense and contained an internal deletion 
(called as a splice junction by STAR), and the total numbers of mvRNAs and spiked-in 
quantitation standards were tallied using the idxstats command of samtools. mvRNA levels 
relative to the quantitation were then reported as number of reads per million mapped (RPM) 
quantitation standard. To validate the qPCR protocol used to prevent over-cycling of 
sequencing libraries, the quantitation was then repeated following removal of PCR 
duplicates, exploiting the UMI appended to each read, using the umi_tools dedup command, 
and counting the various mvRNA species as unique using the --spliced-is-unique option. The 
identities of the individual mvRNAs were then extracted from the SJ.out.tab file generated 
by STAR.
Data processing pipeline for deep sequencing of mvRNAs using adapter ligation
Raw sequencing reads were first trimmed using the cutadapt software package43 to remove 
RNA adapters, sequencing adapters, and reads with quality scores less than 20. Since 
adapter ligation captures both host-derived and virus-derived small RNA species, reads were 
first mapped end-to-end to the DASHR database of human small RNAs46 using the STAR 
aligner42, with spliced alignments disabled (--alignIntronMax 1). Non-human reads were 
outputted using the --outReadsUnmapped Fastx option, were then mapped to the appropriate 
viral reference genome to find mvRNAs as described above, and quantitated relative to the 
total number of viral reads (RPM viral) or host reads (RPM host).
Quantitative mRNA sequencing and differential gene expression analysis
Libraries for gene expression analysis were prepared using a QuantSeq 3' mRNA-Seq 
Library Prep Kit FWD for Illumina (Lexogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions 
and sequenced on a NextSeq 500 sequencer. mRNA reads were aligned to the reference 
genome (CRCh38, GRCm38, or MusPutFur1.0) using the STAR read aligner42, exploiting 
the built-in trimming functions to remove the first 12 bases corresponding the Lexogen 
random primer (--clip5pNbases 12) and any contaminating poly(A) tails in the sequencing 
reads (--clip3pAdapterSeq AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA), as well as requiring a 
minimum match to the reference genome of 40 bp (--outFilterMatchNmin 40). Gene counts 
were generated using reference genome annotations (Gencode v26 for CRCh38, and 
Ensembl 90 for MusPutFur1.0) using the STAR command --quantMode GeneCounts. 
Differential gene expression analysis was then carried out using the DEseq2 package in R47 
to identify genes that were up- or down-regulated as a function of mvRNA levels, 
independently of viral load or titre. Specifically, the likelihood ratio test (LRT) was used to 
compare a full model (in which gene expression varies as a function of both viral load or 
titre, and mvRNA levels) to a reduced model (in which changes in gene expression are fully 
explained by viral load or titre alone) using analysis of deviance (ANODEV) to generate a 
P-value for the log-fold-change of each gene, which were adjusted for multiple testing by 
controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) using Independent Hypothesis Testing48 and 
reported as q-values. mvRNA levels were determined by deep sequencing using universal 
influenza virus primers, as detailed above. Viral load or titre was determined by segment 6 
qRT-PCR or by using previously published values29,30. Subsequent enrichment analysis of 
Gene Ontology terms specifically affected by mvRNA levels was carried out using 
Parametric Analysis of Gene Set Enrichment49 via the GAGE package in R, with data from

 the above genome annotations, accessed via the biomaRt package50. Significance of 
enrichment for GO terms was calculated using a one-sample z-test49 in GAGE, and P-values 
were adjusted for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg method and were reported 
as q-values.

 Figure 1. mvRNAs of influenza A virus are bound by RIG-I and induce IFN expression.
(a) Models of the influenza virus ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complex and potential activators 
of RIG-I. (b) Analysis of IFN-β promoter activity induced by the replication of segment 4, 5 
or 6 vRNAs, DI RNAs or mvRNAs or by the transfection of poly(I:C). PB2, NP and tubulin 
expression was analysed by western blot. P-values were determined using a two-sided 
unpaired t-test. (c) IFN-β promoter activity induced by the replication of engineered, 
segment 5-based, short RNAs in HEK 293T cells. P-values were determined using ANOVA 
with multiple testing compared to the 246 mvRNA. (d) IFN-β promoter activity induced by 
the replication of engineered, segment 5-based, short RNAs in wild-type (RIG-I +/+) or 
HEK 293 RIG-I knockout (RIG-I -/-) cells. P-values were determined as in c. (e) Binding of 
segment 5-based RNAs to myc-tagged RIG-I or mouse EGF control protein (myc-ctrl). P-
values were determined using ANOVA with multiple testing compared to the myc-ctrl with 
246 mvRNA. All graphs show standard deviation and mean of data from three (n=3) 
biologically independent experiments.

 Figure 2. Dysregulation of RNA replication in cells infected with WSN results in the generation 
of mvRNAs.
(a) Analysis of IFN-β promoter activity (graph) and steady state vRNA and mvRNA levels 
(top gel) in WSN infections following overexpression of viral polymerase or viral 
polymerase and NP. mvRNAs were also amplified with universal primers containing 
adapters for sequencing (mvRNAs+adapt) and analysed by PAGE (second gel). NP, PB1 and 
tubulin expression was analysed by western blot. P-values were determined using ANOVA 
compared to lane 2. (b) Quantitation of mvRNAs using deep sequencing, expressed as reads 
per million (RPM). P-value was determined using a two-sided unpaired t-test. (c) mvRNA 
distribution per genome segment. (d) Size distribution of mvRNAs. (e) mvRNA distribution 
per type of intramolecular copy-choice mechanism. (f) Example of mvRNA formation 
through an intramolecular copy-choice mechanism involving a 3′ mismatch. (g) Model of 
mvRNA formation by the polymerase (model adapted from6). All graphs show standard 
deviation and mean of data from two (n=2) (b-d) or three (n=3) (a,e) biologically 
independent experiments.

 Figure 4. Levels of mvRNAs produced during infection correlate with innate immune responses.
(a) Analysis of mvRNAs in A549 cells infected with WSN, VN04, VN04hf using deep 
sequencing or PAGE. mvRNAs were amplified using universal primers containing adapters 
for sequencing (mvRNAs+adapt). mvRNA counts were normalised to mvRNA and mcRNA 
internal standards. NP vRNA and actin mRNA levels were analysed by RT-PCR. P-values 
were determined using ANOVA with adjustments for multiple corrections compared to the 
mock. (b) Analysis of mRNAseq of infected A549 cells showing GO terms down-regulated 
(left) and GO terms up-regulated (right) in VN04 infection as compared to VN04hf in 
response to mvRNA levels. P-values were determined using a one-sample z-test (see 
Methods). Data are from n=4 biologically independent experiments (a,b). (c) Analysis of 
mvRNAs in lungs of ferrets one day after infection with IN05, NL09 or BM18 using deep 
sequencing or PAGE. NP vRNA and actin mRNA levels were analysed by RT-PCR. P-values
