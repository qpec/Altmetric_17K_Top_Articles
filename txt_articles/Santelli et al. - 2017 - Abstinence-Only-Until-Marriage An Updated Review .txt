A B S T R A C T
Adolescence is marked by the emergence of human sexuality, sexual identity, and the initiation of
intimate relations; within this context, abstinence from sexual intercourse can be a healthy choice.
However, programs that promote abstinence-only-until-marriage (AOUM) or sexual risk avoidance
are scientifically and ethically problematic anddas suchdhave been widely rejected by medical
and public health professionals. Although abstinence is theoretically effective, in actual practice,
intentions to abstain from sexual activity often fail. Given a rising age at first marriage around the
world, a rapidly declining percentage of young people remain abstinent until marriage. Promotion
of AOUM policies by the U.S. government has undermined sexuality education in the United States
and in U.S. foreign aid programs; funding for AOUM continues in the United States. The weight of
scientific evidence finds that AOUM programs are not effective in delaying initiation of sexual
intercourse or changing other sexual risk behaviors. AOUM programs, as defined by U.S. federal
funding requirements, inherently withhold information about human sexuality and may provide
medically inaccurate and stigmatizing information. Thus, AOUM programs threaten fundamental
human rights to health, information, and life. Young people need access to accurate and
comprehensive sexual health information to protect their health and lives.

 This review article updates our 2006 review of abstinence-
only-until-marriage (AOUM) policies and programs promoted
by the U.S. government. We use the term AOUM to describe
programs and policies that adhere to U.S. federal government
funding requirements created in 1996. This update addresses the
major changes in AOUM funding and programs, the accumula-
tion of evaluation and observational research, and a better
understanding of the impact of AOUM programs on other public
health programs and specific groups of adolescents.
Methodology
Research on AOUM was identified in multiple ways. We
collected reports from researchers, educators, and policymakers
involved in sexuality education and adolescent health, and we
included policy-relevant information and viewpoints about
AOUM programs from sources such as government reports or
reports
from
advocacy
organizations.
A
literature
review
focusing on the period since 2006 was also undertaken using
Google Scholar, although this identified few additional resources.
Information on human rights was taken from international
declarations and from reports provided by human rights orga-
nizations.
Publications
from
advocacy
organizations
were
included when they were influential in policy debates.
Definitions of Abstinence and Abstinence-Only-Until-
Marriage
Abstinence, as the term is used by program planners and
policymakers, is often not clearly defined. A variety of terms have
been used to describe programs that focus exclusively on pro-
moting abstinence, including “abstinence-only,” “AOUM,” and
“sexual risk avoidance;” the latter term is increasingly used by
proponents. Health professionals generally view abstinence as a
behavioral or health issue, using terms such as “postponing sex,”
“never had vaginal sex,” or refraining from further sexual inter-
course if sexually experienced. In contrast, AOUM proponents
generally define abstinence in moral terms, using language such
as “chaste” or “virgin” and framing abstinence as a “commitment
to chastity.” This terminology reflects the religious origins of
AOUM programs. U.S. federal funding policy adopted such a
moralistic definition of “abstinence education” in 1996, for
example, requiring it “teaches that a mutually faithful monoga-
mous relationship in the context of marriage is the expected
standard of human sexual activity” [1]. See Table 1 for the federal
definition of “abstinence education.”
Thus, it is important to recognize that many advocates of
AOUM programs are primarily concerned with issues such as
character and morality, while health professionals are generally
concerned with health behaviors and health outcomes. This
helps to explain the disconnect between the two groups.
The History of AOUM Funding Programs in the United States
The federal government began supporting abstinence pro-
motion programs in 1981 via the Adolescent Family Life Act,
which provided funding to community- and faith-based orga-
nizations and was established to promote “chastity” and “self-
discipline.” Beginning in 1996, there was a major expansion in
federal support to states for AOUM programming through the
Title V AOUM program (as part of “welfare reform”) and a shift to
funding programs that promoted only abstinence and restricted
other information [2e5]. The Community-Based Abstinence Ed-
ucation (CBAE) program was created in 2000, which made grants
directly to community-based organizations, including faith-
based organizations. Federal funding for these programs grew
rapidly from fiscal year (FY) 1996 until FY 2006. The funding
leveled out between FYs 2006 and 2009 and then was signifi-
cantly reduced in FY 2010. Funding increased in FY 2012, and
again in FY 2016. Between FYs 1982 and 2017, Congress has spent
over $2 billion on domestic AOUM programs [6]. Funding for
AOUM continues today at both the federal and state levels.
With passage of welfare reform in 1996 came the creation of
the Title V AOUM program and eight-point AeH federal statutory
definition of “abstinence education,” which specifies, in part, that
programs must have as their “exclusive purpose” the promotion
of abstinence outside of marriage (see Table 1 for the complete
definition). Programs funded through this funding stream to the
states did not have to address all the eight points of the AeH
definition; however, they could “not be inconsistent with any
aspect of the abstinence education definition [7]” and, therefore,
could not in any way advocate contraceptive use or discuss
contraceptive methods except to emphasize their failure rates
[3,4]. Congressional intent for the CBAE program was to create
“pure” AOUM programs, in response to concerns that states were
using Title V AOUM funds for “soft” activities, such as media
campaigns, instead of direct classroom instruction and were
targeting younger adolescents [3]. CBAE-funded programs were
required to teach all the eight points of the federal definition of
“abstinence education,” had to target 12- to 18-year-olds, andd
except in limited circumstancesdcould not provide young peo-
ple with information about contraception or safer-sex practices,
even with their own nonfederal funds [3]. The guidelines also
broadened the definition of abstinence from avoiding sexual
intercourse to abstaining from all “sexual activity,” which “refers
to any type of genital contact or sexual stimulation between two
persons, including, but not limited to sexual intercourse [8e10].”
In 2004, the House Committee on Government Reform
released a report that 11 of the 13 AOUM programs most widely
used by CBAE grantees contained false, misleading, or distorted
information
about
reproductive
health,
misrepresentations
about the effectiveness of condoms in preventing sexually
Table 1
Federal definition of “abstinence education” [1]
Under Title V, Section 510 of the 1996 Social Security Act, P.L. 104e193, the
term “abstinence education” is defined as an educational or motivational
program which [1]
(A) has as its exclusive purpose, teaching the social, psychological, and
health gains to be realized by abstaining from sexual activity
(B) teaches abstinence from sexual activity outside marriage as the ex-
pected standard for all school-aged children
(C) teaches that abstinence from sexual activity is the only certain way to
avoid out-of-wedlock pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases, and
other associated health problems
(D) teaches that a mutually faithful monogamous relationship in the
context of marriage is the expected standard of human sexual activity
(E) teaches that sexual activity outside of the context of marriage is likely
to have harmful psychological and physical effects
(F) teaches that bearing children out-of-wedlock is likely to have harmful
consequences for the child, the child’s parents, and society
(G) teaches young people how to reject sexual advances and how alcohol
and drug use increases vulnerability to sexual advances
(H) teaches the importance of attaining self-sufficiency before engaging in
sexual activity

 transmitted infections (STIs) and pregnancy, as well as gender
and sexual minority stereotypes, moral judgments, religious
concepts, and factual errors [11]. A report released in November
2006 by the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office
found the Administration for Children and Families, which
oversaw the majority of federal AOUM funding, was providing
very little oversight of funded AOUM programs and noted that
the federal agency did not review its grantees’ materials for
scientific accuracy or even require grantees to review their own
materials for scientific accuracy [12].
Given concerns about program efficacy and increasingly
restrictive federal program requirements, an increasing number of
states refused Title V AOUM funding beginning in 2004. (California
was the only state that never accepted AOUM funding.) By 2009,
nearly half of the states had chosen not to take federal support
[13,14]. In March 2010, Title V AOUM funding was resurrected as
part of negotiations for passage of the Patient Protection and
Affordable Care Act, and $50 million a year was allocated for 5
years ($250 million in total over 2010e2014). In April 2015,
funding for the Title V AOUM program was extended through FY
2017 and increased to $75 million per year in exchange for federal
funding for more comprehensive approaches to sex education, the
Personal Responsibility Education Program, which is also funded
through FY 2017 at a level of $75 million per year. Under current
guidance, the program is more flexible; however, programs must
still teach abstinence to the exclusion of other topics. Programs
must ensure abstinence from sexual activity is an expected
outcome and no funds can be used inways that contradict the AeH
federal AOUM definition. Funded programs may provide mentor-
ing, counseling, and adult supervision and must be medically ac-
curate and age appropriate. States cannot use the funds to educate
adolescents about contraceptive use or discuss contraceptive
methods, except to emphasize failure rates. In FY 2015, 36 states
and six territories applied for Title V AOUM funding [15].
In
December
2010,
Congress
passed
the
Consolidated
Appropriations Act of 2010, which eliminated all existing
discretionary funding for AOUM programs, including the portion
of Adolescent Family Life Act that had been tied to the eight-
point definition of AOUM programs beginning in FY 1997 [16].
This legislation also included the creation of the Teen Pregnancy
Prevention Program, which was funded at $101 million in FY
2016. In FY 2016, Congress created the “Sexual Risk Avoidance
Education” program, which is administered by Family and Youth
Services Bureau in the Administration for Children and Families.
Funded at $10 million in FY 2016, this program is defined as
“voluntarily refraining from nonmarital sexual activity” and
teaching the “benefits associated with self-regulation” and
“success sequencing for poverty prevention,” which is outlined
as “completing school, securing a job, and marrying before
bearing children [17].” In FY 2016, a total of $85 million was
allocated for AOUM programs through the Title V AOUM pro-
gram and the “Sexual Risk Avoidance Education” program and a
total of $176 million was allocated to more comprehensive
sexuality education through the Teen Pregnancy Prevention
Program and Personal Responsibility Education Program.
Trends in initiation of Sexual Intercourse and Marriage
The goal of AOUM programs is to delay initiation of sexual
intercourse until marriage; however, this goal runs counter to
demographic trends in the United States and around the globe.
The clearest trend is a rising age at first marriage; trends in age at
first sex show less change and no universal pattern [18]. Thus, the
rising age at marriage has led to a substantial increase in pre-
marital sex [19].
In the United States, median age at first sex among women fell
from the 1960s (at age 19 years) until the early 1990s (at age
17 years); age at first sex then rose to 17.8 years in 2005 and has
since plateaued [20]. However, given secular trends towards rising
age at marriage over the past 60 years, the interval of time between
first intercourse and first marriage has increased over time for both
women and men in the United States. While the median age at first
intercourse for women is currently 17.8 years, the median age at
first marriage is 26.5 years (a gap of 8.7 years); for men, the gap
between the median age at first sex (18.1 years) and first marriage
(29.8 years) is 11.7 years [20]. Only a small percentage of young
people wait until marriage to have their first intercourse. In
contrast, among women born in the 1940s (and turning age 15
years between 1955 and 1964), the interval between first inter-
course and first marriage was between 1 and 1.5 years.
Psychological and Physical Health Related to Adolescent
Sexual Initiation
The goal of sex education is to raise sexually healthy adults.
Healthy development requires complete information, open and
honest conversations, and support for decision-making about sex
and relationships [21e23]. This vision of sexuality education is
directly contradicted by AOUM thinking (see Table 1) [3,5].
Advocates for AOUM programs and the language of the U.S.
government policy suggest that sexual activity outside of the
context of marriage is likely to have harmful psychological and
physical effects. We find little evidence suggesting that consen-
sual sex between adolescents is psychologically harmful. Rather,
psychological harmdwhen it occursdappears to be the result of
sexual
coercion
and
nonconsensual
experiences,
including
adverse childhood experiences [24] and sexual abuse [25].
Recent large studies of representative adolescent populations
suggest early sexual intercourse is not associated with physical or
emotional symptoms, except to the extent that cultural norms
and social sanctions create disparities for girls compared to boys
with respect to early sexual behavior [26]. Rigid cultural norms
and social sanctions likely account for this gender disparity;
these gender stereotypes undermine adolescents’ sexual health.
Initiation of sexual intercourse in adolescence is associated
with an increased risk of STIs, including HIV, and mistimed and
unwanted pregnancy. Adolescents have the highest age-specific
risk for many STIs [27], and the highest age-specific proportion
of unintended pregnancy [28]. Long-term sequelae of STIs can
include infertility, tubal pregnancy, fetal and infant demise,
chronic pelvic pain, cervical cancer [29], and death from HIV. To
reduce the risk of these adverse outcomes, adolescents can
engage in a variety of risk reduction and risk avoidance (i.e.,
abstinence) behaviors.
The risk associated with adolescent sexual activity is greatly
influenced by policy context. As is the case with the mental
health outcomes of sexual activity, physical outcomes are as
much the result of environmental factors as of individual choices.
In countries in which adolescents receive routine access to con-
traceptive education and counseling, and necessary socioeco-
nomic resources, their pregnancy and birth rates tend to be a
fraction of those of their peers in the United States [30,31]. We
explore the efficacy of risk reduction and risk avoidance next.

 Evaluations of AOUM and Comprehensive Sexuality
Education Programs in Promoting Abstinence
While advocates of AOUM policies and programs have
asserted their effectiveness, scientific evidence suggests other-
wise. A 2007 systematic review by Douglas Kirby [32] found no
scientific evidence that AOUM programs demonstrate efficacy in
delaying initiation of sexual intercourse, reducing the number of
sexual partners, or facilitating secondary abstinence. Moreover, a
rigorous national evaluation was completed in 2007 by Mathe-
matica Policy Research, Inc., with support from the Department
of Health and Human Services Office of the Assistant Secretary
for Planning and Evaluation [33]; among four-model AOUM
programs, no impact was found on initiation of sexual inter-
course, numbers of sexual partners, or other behaviors.
A 2007 Cochrane meta-analysis of 13 AOUM programs found
that evaluated programs consistently showed no impact on
sexual initiation, frequency of vaginal sex, number of partners,
condom use, or the incidence of unprotected vaginal sex [34].
More recently, a 2012 meta-analysis by the U.S. Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention examined 66 comprehensive risk
reduction (CRR) sexual health programs and 23 abstinence pro-
grams. CRR programs had favorable effects on current sexual
activity (i.e., abstinence), number of sex partners, frequency of
sexual activity, use of protection (condoms and/or hormonal
contraception), frequency of unprotected sexual activity, STIs and
pregnancy [35]. In contrast, the meta-analysis of risk avoidance
(AOUM) programs found effects on sexual activity, but not on
other behaviors. (Equivocal changes were found for a decrease in
frequency of sexual activity and an increase in pregnancy.)
Importantly, the effect on sexual activity was only significant in
the nonrandomized control trial subgroup and not significant in
the stronger randomized control trial subgroup. Thus, the Cen-
ters for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that while CRR
programs were an effective strategy for reducing adolescent
pregnancy and STI/HIV among adolescents, “no conclusions
could be drawn on the effectiveness of group-based abstinence
education.” [35]. More recently, a 2016 review of 37 systematic
reviews, summarizing 224 randomized controlled trials of
school-based
sex
education
programs
concluded
that
abstinence-only interventions did not promote positive changes
in sexual initiation or other sexual behaviors [36].
Efficacy for Abstinence in Preventing Pregnancy and STIs
Abstinence from sexual intercourse has been described as
“the only certain way to avoid out-of-wedlock pregnancy, sexu-
ally transmitted diseases (STDs), and other associated health
problems” in the Section 510 Title V federal definition. This is a
misleading and potentially harmful message that conflates
theoretical effectiveness of intentions to remain abstinent and
the actual practice of abstinence. Abstinence is often not effective
in preventing pregnancy or STIs as many young people who
intend to practice abstinence fail to do so.
The most useful observational data in understanding the
efficacy of abstinence intentions comes from examination of the
virginity pledge movement in the National Longitudinal Survey
of Youth (Add Health) [37,38]. Add Health data suggest that many
adolescents who intend to be abstinent fail to do so, and that
when abstainers do initiate intercourse, many fail to use con-
doms and contraception to protect themselves [37,38]. Other
studies
find
higher
rates
of
human
papillomavirus
and
nonmarital pregnancies among adolescent females who took a
virginity pledge than those who did not [39].
Consequently, these studies suggest that user failure with
abstinence is high. Thus, although theoretically completely
effective in preventing pregnancy, in actual practice the efficacy
of AOUM interventions may approach zero.
Public and Professional Support for Abstinence and
Comprehensive Sexuality Education
While the federal AOUM program assumes that abstinence and
AOUM programs are universally valued, public opinion polls in
the United States suggest strong support for comprehensive ap-
proaches to sex educationdincluding abstinence as a behavioral
goaldbut also including education about condoms, contraception,
and access to condoms and contraception for sexually active ad-
olescents. In a 2014 nationally representative survey, 74% of adults
support federal money going to programs proven to delay sex,
improve contraceptive use and/or prevent teen pregnancy [40].
Likewise, health professionals have overwhelmingly supported
comprehensive sexuality education. The major associations of
physicians and public health workers have endorsed comprehen-
sive approaches to sexuality education; many have specifically
taken positions against AOUM programs that limit sexual and
reproductive health information for young people [21e23,41e43].
National public health goals, established by the U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services [44], call for increasing the share of
adolescents receiving formal instruction about birth control
methods, prevention of HIV/AIDS and STIs, and abstinence.
Impact of AOUM Policies on Comprehensive Sexuality
Education
The rise of AOUM policies and funding has been associated
with significant changes in the content of formal sex education in
the U.S. Consecutive surveys on health educational practice in the
United States provide evidence of an erosion of comprehensive
sexuality education in schools. The percentage of schools requiring
instruction about human sexuality fell from 67% in 2000 to 48% in
2014, while the share requiring instruction about HIV prevention
declined from 64% to 41%. By 2014, 50% of middle schools and
junior high schools and 76% of high schools taught abstinence as
the best way to avoid pregnancy, HIV, and STDs [45]. Only 23% of
junior high schools and 61% of high schools taught about methods
of birth control generally, while 10% of middle school and junior
high school teachers and 35% of high school teachers taught
specifically about the correct use of condoms [45].
Likewise, nationally representative data from the National
Survey of Family Growth tracks adolescents’ reports of receipt of
formal sex education from 1995 to 2013. During this period, most
adolescents aged 15e19 years (80%e90%) report formal in-
struction about “how to say no to sex.” In 1995, 81% of adolescent
males and 87% of adolescent females reported receiving formal
instruction about birth control methods; by 2011e2013, this had
fallen to 55% of males and 60% of females. The share of adoles-
cents who received instruction on abstinence but no instruction
about birth control methods, increased from 8% to 28% of females
and from 9% to 35% of males from 1995 to 2011e2013 [46,47].
The lack of clear federal policy guidelines or resources for
adolescent comprehensive sexuality education has resulted in a
wide array of sex education policies at the state and school
district level, and marked disparities by state and district in
J.S. Santelli et al. / Journal of Adolescent Health 61 (2017) 273e280
276
 access to comprehensive sex education and sexual health out-
comes [47,48]. For example, in Indiana, in a single school district,
AOUM is taught in general health classes while comprehensive
sex education is provided to pregnant and parenting teens. State
laws vary considerably. When sex education is taught, 37 require
abstinence to be taught, 26 require abstinence to be stressed, and
11 that abstinence only be covered [49]. Nineteen states require
teaching that sexual activity should only occur in marriage. Eight
states either require negative information on sexual orientation
or do not allow information to be provided on sexual orientation
[49,50]. Policymaking, occurring at the state and local levels,
frequently is done without reference to data on effectiveness, the
need to support healthy sexual development, or the ethics of
withholding potentially lifesaving sexual health information.
Existing state-level data on the effects of state abstinence policies
at best shows no change in teen pregnancy and STIs [48,51e53],
with several studies showing an association between increas-
ingly strict abstinence policies and higher rates of pregnancy,
teen births, and chlamydia infections [54e56].
The Human Right to Sexual Health Information
The U.S. federal approach to abstinence promotion raises
serious ethical and human rights concerns. Access to complete and
accurate STI, HIV/AIDS, and reproductive and sexual health infor-
mation has been recognized as a basic human right and essential
to realizing the human right to the highest attainable standard of
health [57]. Governments have an obligation to provide accurate
information to their citizens and eschew the provision of misin-
formation; such obligations extend to government-funded health
education and health care services [57].
International treaties provide that all people have the right to
“seek, receive, and impart information and ideas of all kinds,”
including information about their health [58e60]. The U.N. Com-
mittee on the Rights of the Childdthe U.N. body responsible for
monitoring implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the
Child,
and
which
provides
authoritative
guidance
on
its
provisionsdhas emphasized that children’s right to access
adequate HIV/AIDS and sexual health information is essential to
securingtheir rights to health andinformation[61,62]. Article12 of
theInternationalCovenantonEconomic,SocialandCulturalRights
specifically obliges governments to take all necessary steps for the
“prevention, treatment, and control of epidemic. diseases,” such
as HIV/AIDS [63]. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural
Rights, the U.N. body responsible for monitoring implementation
of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural
Rights, and which provides authoritative guidance on its pro-
visions,hasinterpretedArticle12torequirethe“theestablishment
of prevention and education programs for behavior-related health
concerns such as STDs, in particular HIV/AIDS, and those adversely
affecting sexual and reproductive health” [60].
The United Nations Guidelines on HIV/AIDS and Human
Rights provide guidance in interpreting international legal
norms as they relate to HIV and AIDS. These guidelines similarly
call on states to
“ensure that children and adolescents have adequate access
to confidential sexual and reproductive health services,
including HIV/AIDS information, counseling, testing and
prevention measures such as condoms,” [64].
Access to accurate health information is a basic human right
that has also been described in international statements on
reproductive rights such as the Programme of Action of the In-
ternational Conference on Population and DevelopmentdCairo,
1994 [65]. Overall, these international treaties and statements
clearly define the important responsibility of governments to
provide accurate and complete information on sexual health to
their adolescent citizens [66].
Ethical Obligations of Health Care Providers and Teachers/
Health Educators
The U.S. AOUM program is also at odds with commonly
accepted notions of medical ethics. Just as adolescents have the
right to accurate and complete information from teachers and
health educators, health care providers have ethical obligations
to provide accurate health information in caring for patients [67].
Health care providers may not withhold information from a
patient to influence health care choices. Informed consent re-
quires provision of all pertinent information to the patient.
Similar ethical obligations apply to health educators [68e70].
The withholding of information on contraception or barrier
protection to induce the adolescent to become abstinent is
inherently coercive. It violates the principle of beneficence (i.e.,
do good and avoid harm) as it may cause an adolescent to use
ineffective (or no) protection against pregnancy and STIs. Simi-
larly, government programs providing abstinence as a sole
option are ethically problematic, as they exclude accurate infor-
mation about contraception and misinform by overemphasizing
or mis-stating the risks of contraception [11,71].
AOUM Programs and Gender Stereotypes
AOUM programming has often included different lessons for
and about girls and boys and reinforces gender stereotypes about
female passivity and male aggressiveness [72]. The 2004
Waxman report found that AOUM programs included gender
stereotypes [11]. Rigid masculinity and femininity beliefs and
gender inequities are often associated with negative sexual
health behaviors including reduced likelihood of condom and
contraceptive use [73,74]. The programs that critique rigid
gender norms and gender-based power imbalances are more
likely to positively impact sexual and reproductive health
knowledge, attitudes, behaviors, and health outcomes.
AOUM Programs and Sexually Active Youth
AOUM programs geared to adolescents who have not yet
engaged in coitus and programs simply promoting abstinence
systematically ignore the immediate needs of sexually active
adolescents, a group with specific reproductive health needs and
who often require more than abstinence education [75]. Sexually
active youth are put at immediate risk when this information is
withheld or distorted. Data from the 2006e2010 Survey of
Family Growth indicate that many sexually experienced adoles-
cents (25% females and 37% males) have not received formal
instruction about birth control methods [47].
AOUM programs often portray abstinence from sexual activity
as a conscious choice over which a young person has total con-
trol. In reality, some young people do not have the choice to
remain abstinent due to intimate partner violence, sexual abuse,
rape, and/or molestation [76,77]. In addition, AOUM programs
dismiss sexually active youth by suggesting that they are less
worthy than their abstinent peers and should feel ashamed of
J.S. Santelli et al. / Journal of Adolescent Health 61 (2017) 273e280
277
 their sexual behavior. Federal guidelines for AOUM programs
associate all premarital sexual activity and nonmarital preg-
nancy, and parenthood with negative health outcomes, including
later sexual dysfunction and or guilt about sex [78].
AOUM Programs and Sexual Minority Youth
AOUM programs may have profoundly negative impacts on
the well-being of sexual minority youth including lesbian, gay,
bisexual, transgender, and questioning (LGBTQ) youth. In 2015
national data from U.S. high school students, 88.8% of students
identified as heterosexual, 2.0% identified as gay or lesbian, 6.0%
identified as bisexual, and 3.2% were not sure of their sexual
identity. Same sex partners were reported by 6.3% of students;
adolescents with same sex partners do not necessarily identify as
lesbian, gay, or bisexual.
AOUM programs are unlikely to meet the health needs of
sexual minority youth, as these programs are largely hetero-
normative and often stigmatize homosexuality as deviant and
unnatural behavior [11,79e81]. Stigma and discrimination can
contribute to health problems such as suicide, feelings of isola-
tion and loneliness, HIV infection, substance abuse, and violence
among sexual minority youth [82e85]. By excluding sexual mi-
norities, AOUM programs may produce feelings of rejection and
being disconnected to school [86].
The U.S. Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage across
the country in 2015. Before this change, for many LGBTQ youth
the AOUM message implied that they should never engage in
sexual activity as marriage was not a legal option for them [80].
However, the heterosexist bias of most AOUM curricula means
that many LGBTQ youth will not get the critical health messages
they need from these programs.
Global Impact of U.S. AOUM Funding
AOUM policies by the U.S. government have also influenced
global
HIV
prevention
efforts
[87],
primarily
through
re-
quirements of the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief
(PEPFAR). Launched in 2003, PEPFAR originally focused on 15
countries in sub-Saharan Africa, the Caribbean, and Asia that had
been severely affected by AIDS. At that time, PEPFAR required
grantees to devote at least 33% of prevention spending (and
two thirds of funds for sexual transmission) to abstinence-
until-marriage programs [88e90]. After 2006, HIV prevention
programs funded under PEPFAR were required to follow specific
guidance on Abstinence, Be faithful, and Condom use issued by
the Office of the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator [91]. The guidance
necessitated that, “implementing partners must.not give a
conflicting message with regard to abstinence by confusing
abstinence messages with condom marketing campaigns that
appear to encourage sexual activity or appear to present absti-
nence and condom use as equally viable, alternative choices
[91].” In response to the Abstinence, Be faithful, and Condom use
guidance, the U.S. Government Accountability Office noted that
separate programming for abstinence within PEPFAR often
undermined country-level national efforts to create integrated
messages and programs for HIV prevention [12]. Human rights
groups also found that U.S. government policy was a source for
misinformation and censorship in PEPFAR countries [92]. The
U.S. emphasis on AOUM may also have reduced condom avail-
ability and access to accurate information on HIV/AIDS in some
countries [92,93].
Notably, a large, well-conducted randomized controlled trial
in Kenya found that the national HIV/AIDS school curriculumd
focusing on AOUM without mention of condoms, contraception,
or health service provisionddid not reduce pregnancy or STIs
and had the unintended consequence of encouraging early
marriage [94]. Further, a 2016 analysis of nationally representa-
tive survey data from 22 countries in sub-Saharan Africa for the
period 1998e2013 found no difference in trends in adolescent
sexual behaviors such as age at first sex between PEPFAR and
non-PEPFAR nationsdsuggesting PEPFAR AOUM funding had
had no impact on sexual behaviors [95].
The emphasis within PEPFAR prevention shifted to science-
based programming after 2008 with the dropping of earmarks
for AOUM [87]. A 2016 HIV prevention initiative for adolescent
girls and young women funded by PEPFAR and private founda-
tions
(DREAMS)
specifically
excludes
abstinence-only
pro-
grammingdgiven that there is little to no evidence of efficacy.
Summary
Policies or programs offering abstinence as a single option for
unmarried adolescents are scientifically and ethically flawed.
AOUM programs have little demonstrated efficacy in helping
adolescents to delay intercourse, while prompting health-
endangering
gender
stereotypes
and
marginalizing
sexual
minority youth. While abstinence from sexual intercourse is
theoretically fully protective against pregnancy and STIs, in
actual practice, AOUM programs often fail to prevent these out-
comes. AOUM programs have generated considerable political
support from social conservatives, despite their lack of scientific
evidence of efficacy and the fact that they withhold critical
health information. The vast majority of Americans strongly
support comprehensive approaches to sexuality education.
Despite the fact that health care was founded on ethical
notions of informed consent and free choice, federal AOUM
programs are inherently coercive, withholding information
needed to make informed choices and promoting questionable,
inaccurate, and stigmatizing opinions. Federal funding language
promotes a specific moral viewpoint, not a public health
approach. Federally funded AOUM programs censor lifesaving
information about prevention of pregnancy, HIV, and other STIs
and
provide
incomplete
or
misleading
information
about
contraception and leave sexual minority youth particularly
vulnerable. U.S. AOUM policies and programs are inconsistent
with commonly accepted notions of human rights.
In many U.S. communities, there have been declines in the
provision of formal sex education (i.e., delivered by schools,
churches, and other trusted social institutions) in the last
decade, leaving young people without the critical health in-
formation they need. Increased funding for AOUM or sexual risk
avoidance approaches would further restrict young people’s
access to the education they need to stay safe and healthy. In
both domestic and global contexts, AOUM has not resulted in
delays in sexual intercourse or the adoption of more protective
sexual behaviors. The emphasis on AOUM approaches has
harmed other public health efforts, such as family planning
programs and HIV prevention efforts, domestically and globally.
Governments in the United States and elsewhere should sup-
port medically accurate, evidence-based, and scientifically
justified approaches to sexuality education for young people.
AOUM as a basis for health policy and programs should be
abandoned.
