DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A 12-month, cluster randomized, assessor-blind, clinical
trial enrolling 371 adult postpartum women at 12 clinics in WIC programs from the California
central coast between July 2011 and May 2015 with data collection completed in May 2016.
INTERVENTIONS Clinics were randomized to the WIC program (standard care group) or the
WIC program plus a 12-month primarily internet-based weight loss program (intervention
group), including a website with weekly lessons, web diary, instructional videos,
computerized feedback, text messages, and monthly face-to-face groups at the WIC clinics.

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among low-income postpartum women, an internet-based
weight loss program in addition to the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women,
Infants, and Children (WIC program) compared with the WIC program alone resulted in a
statistically significant greater weight loss over 12 months. Further research is needed to
determine program and cost-effectiveness as part of the WIC program.

 O
f the approximately 4 million women who give birth
in the United States each year, between 2004 and
2008 an estimated 25% experienced major weight
retention after pregnancy, retaining more than 4.5 kg and
gaining additional weight during the postpartum year.1
Prevalence rates of postpartum weight retention are higher
among low-income Hispanic women and women with food
insecurity, affecting 40% to 60% of this group.1-3 Postpartum
weight retention tends to be centrally deposited4 and is an
independent risk factor for long-term health consequences
for the mother, including increased risk of lifetime obesity,
cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes.5 Also, women
with high postpartum weight retention are heavier prior to
their next pregnancy, which increases risk of pregnancy-
related complications, obesity, and health complications in
future offspring.6
Several researchers and government agencies have
called for empirical studies evaluating interventions that
occur after pregnancy with the specific aim of reducing high
postpartum weight retention and the health risks of mater-
nal postpartum obesity.1,7 Intervention trials testing meth-
ods to reduce postpartum weight retention in women have
been limited by short duration (≤6 months), high attrition
(30%-40%), and lack of efficacy, particularly among low-
income or racial/ethnic minorities.8-12 Internet-based inter-
ventions have been shown to be effective, although less
data are available from community settings with lower
income and minority samples.13,14
The primary goal of this cluster randomized trial was to
evaluate the 12-month efficacy of a culturally and linguisti-
cally adapted, primarily internet-based behavioral weight loss
intervention for low-income postpartum women in the Spe-
cial Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and
Children (WIC program).
Methods
Design
Fit Moms/Mamás Activas was a cluster randomized clinical
trial. The trial protocol and statistical analysis are available in
the Supplement and have been published previously.15
Participants
Procedures were approved by the California Polytechnic State
University institutional review board, and all participants
provided written informed consent. Recruitment occurred
between July 2011 and May 2015 across 12 WIC clinics in
Santa Barbara (n = 6), San Luis Obispo (n = 4), and Ventura
(n = 2) counties of the California central coast, which were
selected based on size, proximity to the university, and repre-
sentativeness. Clinics had to accept the randomization of the
study, recruitment, and intervention protocols. Participant
eligibility was based on self-report and included being 6
weeks to 12 months post partum and having a body mass
index (BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by
height in meters squared) of more than 25 or a BMI from 22
to 24.9 but exceeding prepregnancy weight by 4.5 kg or
more. Participants were aged 18 to 40 years, spoke English or
Spanish, were nonsmoking, owned a cell phone, and had a
fifth-grade education or higher. Exclusion criteria are dis-
played in Figure 1.
Interventions
The study statistician randomized the 12 clinics to the 2 con-
ditions, blocking on county (ie, San Luis Obispo [4 clinics];
Santa Barbara [6 clinics]; Ventura [2 clinics]) and using the
R (R Foundation), version 3.3.1, statistical software package.
Standard Care Group
The standard care group received all aspects of the standard
WIC program18 plus a brief orientation to the study and news-
letters every 2 months with information about weight con-
trol, exercise, nutrition, and wellness.
Intervention Group
The intervention group received all elements of the standard
WIC program plus a 12-month primarily internet-based
weight loss program adapted from prior programs.16,17 Calo-
rie goals (from 1200 to 1800 calories per day with 300 addi-
tional calories for mothers who were breastfeeding) were
provided based on study entry weight and breastfeeding
status.15,19,20 Physical activity goals gradually increased to 30
minutes or more per day on most days of the week. The pro-
gram was available in English and Spanish and provided
guidance and resources, automated feedback, weekly les-
sons, a web diary, a weight and physical activity tracker,
instructional and inspirational videos, and a message board.
Four weekly text messages notified participants of new web-
site content and provided motivation, support, and feedback.
Study interventionists held monthly face-to-face group ses-
sions at WIC clinics. WIC program staff were encouraged to
reinforce website use via distribution of promotional cards
during participants’regular WIC program visits.
Outcome Assessments
Assessments were conducted at study entry, 6 months, and 12
months. Participants received $25 for completing base-
line and 6-month assessments and $50 for the 12-month as-
sessment. Assessment staff was blinded to randomization.
Key Points
Question Does an internet-based weight loss program promote
long-term weight loss in low-income postpartum women in the
Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants,
and Children (WIC program)?
Findings In this cluster randomized trial including 371 low-income
postpartum women, an internet-based program plus the WIC
program produced significantly greater weight loss over 12 months
compared with the WIC program alone (3.2 kg vs 0.9 kg).
Meaning Among low-income postpartum women,
an internet-based weight loss program plus the WIC program
compared with the WIC program alone resulted in significantly
greater weight loss over 12 months. Future research is needed
to determine cost-effectiveness.

 In a few instances, the assessor became unblinded and in
these cases was reassigned and did not complete any un-
blinded assessments.
The primary outcome was weight change over 12
months, based on measured weights at baseline, 6 months,
and 12 months. Secondary outcomes were proportion of
women returning to preconception weight and changes
in physical activity and dietary intake. Other secondary out-
comes are not reported in this article, including weight
control behaviors and psychosocial factors.15 Outcomes that
were not prespecified included waist circumference,
percentage weight loss, and proportions achieving 5% or

 more and 10% or more weight loss. Post hoc analyses esti-
mated program costs from a payer perspective.
Weight was assessed in lightweight clothing using a cali-
brated scale. Height was measured without shoes. Prepreg-
nancy weight was based on self-report at the time of the last
menstrual period.21,22 Waist circumference was measured at
the midpoint between the highest point of the iliac crest and
thelowestpointofthecostalmarginusingatapemeasure.Race
andethnicity,education,income,employmentstatus,andpar-
ity were assessed as potential intervention moderators and
measured using self-report questionnaires with fixed catego-
ries. Adverse events were based on participant report of the
numberofinjuriesassociatedwithphysicalactivity,newmedi-
cal diagnoses, overnight hospitalizations, and experiences of
low breastmilk supply.
Dietary intake was assessed using 24-hour recalls on
2 random days over a week and completed using the National
Cancer Institute Automated Self-Administered 24-Hour
(ASA24) dietary assessment tool. 23,24 A waist-worn acceler-
ometer (GT3X+; ActiGraph) measured physical activity.25
Wear time was determined using the Choi algorithm.26 For
inclusion in the analysis, the accelerometer had to be worn 8
hours or longer per day and worn for at least 2 days but no
more than 7 days.
In exploratory analysis, costs were estimated from the
payer perspective and excluded 1-time “sunk costs” (eg,
intervention, equipment costs, staff training). Mean labor
costs for intervention delivery (ie, monthly 60-minute group
visits; 15 minutes per week message board monitoring) were
estimated at 12.16 hours per participant × the mean hourly
rate of a community health worker ($17.95 per hour).27 Labor
costs included having a computer scientist troubleshoot
technical issues (15 minutes per participant × $40.95 per
hour).28 Nonlabor costs (eg, paper materials, scales, pedom-
eters) were estimated at $48.00 per participant.
Statistical Analysis
Sample Size
The targeted sample size of 12 clinics with 34 participants per
clinic (N = 408) was projected to provide 80% or more power
to detect a clinically important5,29,30 difference of 2 kg or more
in weight change between the 2 groups over 12 months with
an SD of 4.5 kg and an intraclass correlation of 0.02,31,32 using
a 2-sided t test with a significance level of .05. The minimal
clinically important difference of 2 kg was selected based on
prior research showing that 1 kg or more of postpartum weight
retention5 and modest gains of 0.8 kg to 1 kg per year in young
adults29 have been linked with metabolic disease; also, mod-
est 2% to 5% weight losses have been shown to have meta-
bolic health benefits.30 The sample size calculations accom-
modated the possibility of 2 clinic withdrawals (ie, potential
analytic sample of 10 clinics), and an overall participant attri-
tion of up to 30% (122 of 407 participants) and intention-to-
treat analyses.
Statistical Analysis Plan
Missing data were assumed to be missing at random. The
approach included a likelihood-based, linear mixed-effects
model that included the randomized clinics (and excluded 1
clinic that withdrew) and all participants in these clinics as
random effects. This model allowed for participants to have
partial missing response data and still be included in the
model without imputation. Also, a sensitivity analysis was
conducted for the primary outcome in which 10 random mul-
tivariate normal imputations based on the observed variables
(group, ethnicity, education, income, employment status,
waist circumference, and weight) at previous assessments
were used to impute missing weight data. Model parameter
estimates from the imputed data sets were pooled, compared
with estimates from the primary analysis, and verified to be
within 2 standard errors of each other. The t tests or χ2 tests
were used to compare women with complete and incomplete
records on group assignment, maternal BMI, ethnicity, weeks
post partum, income, education, and age.
To test the primary hypothesis, a generalized linear
mixed-effect model was used (intervention group as a fixed
effect and clinic and subject as random effects). A
group × time interaction term (fixed effect) tested whether
the change in weight over time differed significantly. The
model included participant-level covariates (ie, ethnicity,
weeks post partum at study entry, lactation, and age). Partial
F tests were first used to simultaneously test all main effects
and interactions. If the group × time interaction was statisti-
cally significant (P < .005), the equality of mean changes in
the 2 groups at each intermediate time point was tested.
Similar linear mixed-effects models with the same partici-
pant covariates were conducted to examine changes over
time in waist circumference, percentage of weight lost, and
generalized linear mixed-effects models with binomial errors
and logit link were used to examine effects on proportions
achieving prepregnancy weight or below, and proportions
achieving 5% or more and 10% or more reduction in initial
body weight. Unadjusted P values were reported,33,34 but a
Bonferroni correction factor (P < .005) based on 10 compari-
sons was used for interpretation of significance (family-wise
error rate = 0.05). Linear mixed-effects models were also
used to examine whether baseline variables (ethnicity, edu-
cation, employment, lactation, BMI category at study entry,
income, age, weeks post partum at entry, and parity) moder-
ated weight loss outcomes. In all analyses, model conditions
for numeric responses were verified with diagnostic plots.
Partial correlation analysis examined the relationship
between engagement variables (eg, login frequency, atten-
dance) and weight change, adjusting for the same covariates.
R (R Foundation), version 3.3.1; SPSS (IBM), version 23; and
JMP (SAS Institute), version 12.2.0, statistical software pack-
ages were used for all analyses.
Results

 characteristics did not significantly differ between partici-
pants who attended vs did not attend the 12-month visit.
Primary Outcome
Weight change variables are summarized in Table 2. A sig-
nificant interaction between group and time was observed,
with greater weight loss in the intervention group than
the standard care group (P < .001; Figure 2). Over 12
months, the standard care group lost an average of 0.9 kg,
whereas the intervention group lost 3.2 kg. Weight loss
was 2.3 kg (95% CI, 1.1 to 3.5) greater in the intervention
group compared with the standard care group over 12
months (P < .001). Results from the sensitivity analysis
using multiple imputations were similar with a weight
loss at 12 months of 2.9 kg in the intervention group and
1.3 kg in the standard care group, representing a difference
of 1.6 kg (95% CI, 0.1 to 3.0; P = .03). Several demographic
factors were examined collectively as potential treatment
effect modifiers. No significant moderators emerged
(F13,332 = 0.75; P = .71).
Secondary Outcomes
The intervention increased the percentage of participants
who achieved preconception weight or below (P < .001)
(Table 3). Overall, 32.8% of the intervention group and
18.6% of the standard care group were at preconception
weight or below by 12 months, representing a difference of
14.2 percentage points (95% CI, 4.7 to 23.5; P < .001). The
intervention had no significant (P = .76) effects on moderate
to vigorous physical activity (difference, −0.7 min/d [95%
CI, −42.0 to 10.6]) or other activity parameters, which
declined over time (Table 4). Calorie intake declined over
time (Table 4), but there were no significant (P = .06) group
differences (difference, −154 kcal/d [95% CI, −325 to 17]).

 Outcomes Not Prespecified
As shown in Table 2, at 12 months, waist circumference was
lower in the intervention group compared with the standard
care group (difference, 2.8 cm [95% CI, 1.3 to 4.3]; P < .001).
Also, the percentage of weight loss over 12 months was higher
in the intervention group than the standard care group (dif-
ference, 3.1 percentage points [95% CI, 1.6 to 4.6]; P < .002)
(Table 2). The proportion reaching 5% or more weight loss was
higherintheinterventiongroupthaninthestandardcaregroup
at 12 months (difference, 16.8 percentage points [95% CI, 6.3
to 27.1]; P < .005), as was the proportion reaching 10% or more
weight loss (difference, 13.2 percentage points [95% CI, 4.6 to
21.7]; P = .007).
Post Hoc Outcomes
Estimated mean labor costs for intervention delivery
($218.27) and technical assistance ($10.23 per participant)
totaled $228.50 per participant annually, and nonlabor costs
(eg, paper materials, scales, pedometers) were approxi-
mately $48.00 per participant. Thus, total per-participant
costs from the payer perspective were estimated at $276.00
per participant annually.
Intervention Adherence
The mean number of logins was 74.0 (SD, 111.0) overall and 6.0
(SD, 9.3) logins per month; these means included the 12 par-
ticipants who never logged onto the website. Login fre-
quency was significantly related to 12-month weight loss
(R = 0.25; P = .003). Attendance at monthly group meetings
(range, 0-12 meetings) was a mean 4.4 (SD, 2.7) visits overall,
representing 37% of expected visit attendance. Attendance at
group visits was also significantly correlated with greater 12-
month weight loss (R = 0.18; P = .03).
Adverse Events
No important group differences were observed in safety alerts
or adverse events (Table 5).
Discussion
This cluster randomized trial found that an internet-based
weight loss program integrated into the WIC program
with monthly group visits was effective in promoting sig-
nificant weight loss in low-income postpartum women.
The intervention was effective across all demographic char-
acteristics and among women who were breastfeeding and
not breastfeeding.

a Physical activity was based on objective assessment for a 1-week period;
97.5% of participants (361 of 370) completed this at baseline, 71.0% (263 of
370) at 6 months, and 60.5% (224 of 370) at 12 months. Of these, proportions
with valid data were 296 of 361 participants (82%) at baseline; 195 of 263
participants (74%) at 6 months and 155 of 224 participants (69%) at 12
months. The analysis excluded 28 women (16 from the standard care group
and 12 from the intervention group) due to suboptimal actigraph wear time at
all 3 assessments (ie, <8 h and <2 d) and 3 from the standard care group due to
missing covariates, resulting in 339 included in the analytic sample.
Participants who completed vs did not complete the actigraph measures at 12
months did not significantly differ in group assignment, age, ethnicity, weight
status, weeks post partum, income, or employment at study entry.
bDiet was based on data from the Automated Self-Administered 24-Hour
dietary assessment tool; 99.2% of participants (367 of 370) completed this
assessment at baseline, 78.1% (289 of 370) at 6 months, and 69.7% (258 of
370) at 12 months. The analysis excluded 3 women from the standard care
group due to missing covariates, resulting in 367 included in the analytic

 The 2.3-kg-greater weight loss of the intervention group
compared with standard care may seem modest but should
be considered in the context of a young adult, postpartum
population. Weight gains of 0.8 kg to 1 kg per year in young
adults has been found to increase cardiovascular disease
risk,29 and 2% to 5% weight loss results in improved systolic
blood pressure, glucose, and triglycerides.30 Even modest (≥1
kg) postpartum weight retention has been linked to increased
risk of later weight gain and development of obesity and dia-
betes in women,5 and the intervention group increased by
14.2 percentage points the proportion of women achieving
preconception weight or below over 12 months. Future
research is needed to assess the effect of this intervention’
s
postpartum weight changes on long-term health.
There were no significant group differences in dietary
intake or physical activity, which is surprising given the
effects on weight loss in the intervention group. Self-
reported dietary intake is consistently underreported among
women with obesity and dieters.35,36 The ASA24 dietary
recall instrument has been validated23 but not in primarily
Hispanic populations. It is possible that dietary intake was
reduced among intervention participants but not captured by
the measurement instrument. Physical activity was objec-
tively measured using a waist-worn accelerometer. Although
this method has some limitations, accelerometers provide
reliable estimates of physical activity.37 The reasons behind
the lack of an intervention effect on activity remain unclear;
the intervention targeted the most commonly reported barri-
ers in postpartum women, including time, child care, and
fatigue.38 The intervention provided pedometers, encour-
aged “baby-friendly” and inexpensive lifestyle activities, and
gradually increased in physical activity. Other research has
highlighted the potential importance of health professionals
and partner support in promoting postpartum physical
activity.38 These elements and other dietary instruments
could be studied in future interventions.
A potential benefit of a primarily internet-based inter-
vention is the relatively low delivery cost compared with tra-
ditional programs requiring more frequent face-to-face
contact.39 As an exploratory analysis, the payer’
s cost was
estimated at $276 per participant (about $125 per kilo-
gram lost) and may be less expensive than traditional
face-to-face weight loss interventions.40 However, future
cost-effectiveness trials are needed.
This study had several strengths. It is a long-term,
adequately powered study of an internet-based weight con-
trol program for low-income postpartum women delivered in
WIC. The sample included predominantly Hispanic women
who face food insecurity. The intervention was developed in
consultation with the WIC program. The study used a stan-
dard care control group, which has been lacking in other
studies.13 Also, measures were collected by assessors who
were masked to randomization, and retention was high at all
time points (≥89%).
Limitations
This study had several limitations. The study sample was
restricted to women in the WIC program, and some could
not be reached (25%) or refused participation (17%). The
study provided some participants (n = 63; 36.2%) with
internet access, which could be cost-prohibitive; however,
internet access has increased steadily since 2010 to more
than 74% of low-income households and 81% of the
Hispanic population.41 The study groups were not matched
on contact, so it remains unknown if the weight differences
were attributable to actual intervention components.
The study design tested a treatment “package” and did not
allow for isolation of the independent contribution of dis-
crete intervention components. The intervention did not
include an app, which might have enhanced utilization.
To gain efficiency, linear mixed-effects models used all
available data, including from participants with missing
data. Although attrition was minimal (10.8%) and sensitivity
analyses were consistent, it is possible that the results
could be biased if the data lost to follow-up were not miss-
ing at random. The sensitivity analysis resulted in a mean
1.6-kg loss and P value of .03; these fell short of the loss
of 2 kg or more considered clinically important and the
Bonferroni-corrected threshold of P = .005. In addition, as
women likely underreported preconception weight, the
intervention’
s effect on return to prepregnancy weight
might also be inaccurate.
Conclusions
Among low-income postpartum women, an internet-based
weight loss program in addition to the Special Supplemental
Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC)
compared with the WIC program alone resulted in a sta-
tistically significant greater weight loss over 12 months.
Further research is needed to determine program and cost-
effectiveness as part of the WIC program.
