Abstract
The calcium-binding protein calbindin-D28k is critical for hippocampal function and cognition1-3, 
but its expression is markedly decreased in various neurological disorders associated with 
epileptiform activity and seizures4-7. In Alzheimer's disease (AD) and epilepsy, both of which are 
accompanied by recurrent seizures8, the severity of cognitive deficits reflects the degree of 
calbindin reduction in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG)4,9,10. However, despite the importance 
of calbindin in both neuronal physiology and pathology, the regulatory mechanisms that control its 
expression in the hippocampus are poorly understood. Here we report an epigenetic mechanism by 
which seizures chronically suppress hippocampal calbindin expression and impair cognition. We

 demonstrate that ΔFosB, a highly stable transcription factor, is induced in the hippocampus of 
mouse models of AD and seizures, where it binds and triggers histone deacetylation at the 
calbindin gene (Calb1) promoter, and downregulates Calb1 transcription. Notably, increasing DG 
calbindin levels, either by direct virus-mediated expression or inhibition of ΔFosB signaling, 
improves spatial memory in a mouse model of AD. Moreover, levels of ΔFosB and calbindin 
expression are inversely related in DG of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) or AD, and 
correlate with performance on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). We propose that 
chronic suppression of calbindin by ΔFosB is one mechanism by which intermittent seizures drive 
persistent cognitive deficits in conditions accompanied by recurrent seizures.
Expression of calbindin-D28k in the hippocampal DG is indicative of cognitive function in 
both patients and mouse models of AD and epilepsy4,9-12. In addition, calbindin 
knockdown/knockout animals exhibit impaired synaptic plasticity and spatial 
memory1-3,13,14. These findings highlight calbindin's role as a critical regulator of neuronal 
calcium signaling and hippocampal function15. However, little is known about the regulatory 
mechanisms that modulate calbindin expression in normal or pathologic conditions. 
Considering how crucial calbindin is for synaptic function and cognition1-3,13,14, elucidating 
these mechanisms is essential as it may aid the development of novel therapeutics to 
ameliorate cognitive deficits in AD and other disorders associated with seizures.
To identify mechanisms that control hippocampal calbindin expression, we examined long-
term gene regulation in the hippocampus of a transgenic AD mouse model expressing 
mutant human amyloid precursor protein (APP)16. APP mice of both sexes were examined 
at 2-4 months of age, an age when they begin to exhibit spontaneous recurrent seizures and 
cognitive deficits similar to AD patients, but prior to plaque deposition16-19. By 
immunohistochemical analysis, we found that hippocampal calbindin expression was lower 
in APP mice compared to non-transgenic littermates (NTG), and that levels of calbindin 
expression inversely correlated with the frequency of electroencephalographic (EEG) 
seizures (Fig. 1a,b), similar to patients with seizures5,10. Notably, even APP mice with 
relatively infrequent seizures exhibited reduced calbindin expression, suggesting that 
downregulation of hippocampal calbindin was mediated by long-lasting, activity-dependent 
mechanisms. After surveying the literature to determine what activity-dependent factors 
might regulate calbindin expression over extended periods of time, we focused on ΔFosB, a 
truncated splice variant of the transcription factor FosB. ΔFosB is a unique activity-
dependent immediate early gene (IEG) product, possessing an unusually long half-life (∼8 
days) that allows it to exert persistent control over neuronal gene expression20. The actions 
of ΔFosB in epigenetic gene regulation are well studied in the nucleus accumbens20,21, and a 
recent study suggests that it may also have functions in the hippocampus22. We found that 
seizures were associated with elevated hippocampal expression of ΔFosB, and higher levels 
of ΔFosB expression were correlated with lower calbindin expression in APP mice (Fig. 
1b,c). Therefore, we hypothesized that ΔFosB is a key regulatory factor involved in the 
suppression of calbindin following epileptiform activity in AD and other seizure-associated 
disorders.

 To test this hypothesis, we performed a promoter analysis of Calb1 to identify potential 
regulatory regions where ΔFosB might bind. Our analysis revealed a region 320 bp upstream 
of the transcription start site containing cAMP and TPA response elements (CRE and TRE, 
respectively) in close proximity to one another (Supplemental Fig. 1a). Since both elements 
are known to recruit IEG proteins23, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) 
on hippocampal tissue from APP as well as NTG mice to test whether ΔFosB enrichment 
occurred at this promoter region. Indeed, ChIP results confirmed binding of ΔFosB to the 
promoter of Calb1, and ΔFosB enrichment at this site was greater in APP mice relative to 
NTG littermates (Fig. 1d). ΔFosB enrichment on Calb1 was validated by comparison to IgG 
control ChIP and promoter amplicon sequencing (Supplemental Fig. 1b,c). These data 
highlight the potential ability of ΔFosB to regulate calbindin expression via actions at the 
Calb1 promoter gene.
We therefore assessed whether ΔFosB binding to Calb1 was associated with chromatin 
modifications that would impact Calb1 expression. Previous studies have demonstrated that 
reduction of calbindin protein levels in AD and epilepsy patients and rodent models occurs 
downstream of mRNA reduction4,7,9,24. In line with these findings, ΔFosB binds histone 
deacetylase 1 (HDAC1)21, suggesting that it suppresses Calb1 transcription via histone 
deacetylation. Indeed, we found hypoacetylated histone 4 lysine residues on the Calb1 
promoter in APP mice relative to NTG controls (Fig. 1e and Supplemental Fig. 2a,b). We 
did not detect changes in acetylation on histone 3. Because long-term histone 
hypoacetylation can trigger histone methylation to further suppress gene expression21,25, we 
also assessed histone methylation at the Calb1 promoter. We found that the Calb1 promoter 
was hypermethylated in APP mice at histone 4 lysine 20, but not histone 3 lysine 9 (Fig. 1f 
and Supplemental Fig. 2c-e). Together, these results demonstrate Calb1 regulation by 
specific histone 4 modifications.
The activity-driven nature of ΔFosB expression20 and prevalence of calbindin reduction 
across many disorders accompanied by seizures4-7,9,10 suggest that epigenetic regulation of 
Calb1 by ΔFosB occurs in not just APP mice but also other rodent models with seizures. 
Therefore, we examined the relationship between ΔFosB and calbindin in a mouse model of 
epilepsy in which severe seizures lasting several hours (status epilepticus) are induced by 
pilocarpine. Similar to APP mice, we found elevated binding of ΔFosB to the Calb1 
promoter, and lower Calb1 promoter histone 4 acetylation, in pilocarpine-treated mice 
relative to saline-treated controls (Fig. 1g,h and Supplemental Fig. 3a,b). Moreover, DG 
granule cells in pilocarpine-treated mice exhibited higher ΔFosB and lower calbindin protein 
expression that was evident on a cell-by-cell basis (Fig. 1i). The inverse relationship between 
ΔFosB and calbindin was also evident on a cell-by-cell basis in APP mice (Fig. 1j).
To demonstrate that a reduction in calbindin expression can be a direct result of ΔFosB-
mediated epigenetic regulation, we tested whether adenoassociated virus (AAV)-mediated 
overexpression of ΔFosB in the hippocampus of wild-type C57BL/6 mice (AAV-ΔFosB 
mice) could suppress calbindin expression. Virus carrying CMV promoter-driven ΔFosB/
eGFP or eGFP alone was stereotaxically infused into the DG of wild-type C57BL/6 mice 
(see Methods). This infusion resulted in robust ΔFosB and eGFP expression throughout the 
rostral-caudal extent of the DG (Fig. 2a,b and Supplemental Figs. 4,5). Viral overexpression

 of ΔFosB in wild-type mice did not affect neuronal survival or expression of neuron-specific 
genes such as NeuN (Supplemental Fig. 4c,e), and there was no detectable epileptiform 
activity in the hippocampus (Supplemental Fig. 6). Notably, ΔFosB overexpression did 
enhance the binding of ΔFosB to Calb1 (Fig. 2c and Supplemental Fig. 3c), and triggered 
Calb1 promoter histone 4 deacetylation (Fig. 2d and Supplemental Fig. 3d), consistent with 
its ability to recruit HDAC1 to gene promoters21. Furthermore, we found lower levels of 
calbindin mRNA and protein in the DG of AAV-ΔFosB mice (Fig. 2e-h). Reduced calbindin 
protein expression was apparent in both molecular and granule cell layers of the DG, 
reflecting the dendrites and cell bodies of granule cells, respectively (Supplemental Fig. 7a-
d). Overall, these results demonstrate direct epigenetic control of Calb1 by ΔFosB. We also 
found that ΔFosB overexpression was sufficient to suppress granule cell expression of cFos, 
another gene target of ΔFosB (Supplemental Fig. 7e,f and21). These findings are consistent 
with prior studies showing that cFos expression in granule cells is increased acutely, but 
decreased chronically, by seizures26.
To determine whether ΔFosB-mediated gene changes directly impact cognition, we tested 
spatial memory in AAV-ΔFosB mice using the object location test. This test is hippocampus-
dependent27, and has previously been used to demonstrate spatial memory impairments in 
mouse models of AD and epilepsy28,29. We found that overexpression of ΔFosB in the 
hippocampus was sufficient to impair spatial memory (Fig. 2i).
To demonstrate that ΔFosB is not only sufficient but also necessary for regulating 
hippocampal calbindin expression and memory function, we tested whether inhibition of 
ΔFosB signaling in APP mice could normalize calbindin expression and ameliorate spatial 
memory deficits. To block ΔFosB signaling, we infused AAV carrying ΔJunD/eGFP into the 
DG of APP mice. ΔJunD is a truncated mutant of the transcription factor JunD, a 
predominant endogenous binding partner of ΔFosB in the brain20. This truncation removes 
the transactivation domain of JunD while leaving its dimerization and DNA-binding 
domains intact30. Therefore, dimerization of ΔJunD with ΔFosB inhibits ΔFosB in a 
dominant negative fashion. Notably, consistent with its truncation, ΔJunD does not preclude 
ΔFosB from binding its gene targets, but instead prevents the interaction of ΔFosB with 
downstream transcriptional co-regulators at target gene promoters20,30. Expression of ΔJunD 
in different brain regions effectively antagonizes ΔFosB-mediated gene regulation20,31. 
Using the object location test, we found that expression of ΔJunD in the hippocampus 
improved spatial memory in APP mice (Fig. 3a). We also demonstrate that ΔFosB is 
required for epigenetic suppression of Calb1 in APP mice, since ΔJunD expression restored 
Calb1 promoter histone acetylation (Fig. 3b and Supplemental Fig. 3e) and improved 
calbindin protein expression in the DG (Fig. 3c,d). Given that ΔJunD-mediated amelioration 
of spatial memory in APP mice was accompanied by improved calbindin expression, we 
then asked whether direct restoration of hippocampal calbindin expression in APP mice 
could also improve memory. To bypass endogenous control of Calb1 by ΔFosB, we infused 
AAV carrying CMV promoter-driven calbindin/eGFP into the hippocampus to elevate 
calbindin expression in APP mice (Fig. 3e,f). We found that directly elevating hippocampal 
expression of calbindin in APP mice improved object location memory (Fig. 3g), similar to 
hippocampal ΔJunD expression.

 Our findings in APP mice suggest that regulation of calbindin by ΔFosB may be a potential 
therapeutic target in AD and other seizure-associated disorders. To determine whether the 
relationship between ΔFosB and calbindin also exists in human patients, we examined 
expression patterns of both proteins in the DG of patients diagnosed with mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) or AD. Indeed, higher ΔFosB expression corresponded with lower 
calbindin expression in MCI and AD patients (Fig. 4a-d), similar to APP mice. In addition, 
we observed a correlation between levels of both proteins and MMSE scores in MCI but not 
AD patients, presumably because of the numerous deficits in AD relative to MCI (Fig. 4e-h). 
There was also a significant correlation between ΔFosB or calbindin expression and MMSE 
scores when all patients (control, MCI, AD) were analyzed together (Supplemental Figs. 8 
and 9). Lastly, to determine whether the relationship between ΔFosB and calbindin 
expression also exists in non-AD related conditions in which recurrent seizures occur, we 
examined DG tissue resected from TLE patients. Consistent with findings in MCI and AD 
patients, we observed an inverse relationship between ΔFosB and calbindin expression in 
TLE patients (Fig. 4i,j).
In summary, we have discovered a novel regulatory mechanism in which epileptiform 
activity recruits ΔFosB to epigenetically suppress calbindin expression in the DG. In doing 
so, we highlight ΔFosB's role as a transcription factor capable of chronically suppressing a 
gene that regulates synaptic transmission, plasticity, cognition, and seizure-related 
pathology. Given the prevalence of seizures across various disorders such as autism and 
schizophrenia32,33 in addition to epilepsy and AD, the identification of ΔFosB's role in the 
hippocampus may have broad implications for understanding why cognitive deficits are co-
morbidities of many disorders accompanied by seizures. Furthermore, nuclear accumulation 
of ΔFosB due to its unusually long half-life provides a mechanism to explain why cognitive 
deficits persist even during seizure-free periods. Our finding that elevated ΔFosB expression 
correlates with reduced calbindin expression in both AD and TLE patients suggests that 
patients and rodent models of human disease share similar mechanisms of epigenetic 
regulation induced by seizures. By restoring memory function in APP mice either via ΔFosB 
inhibition or virus-driven calbindin expression, we have identified a molecular pathway that 
can potentially be targeted to improve cognition in AD and other seizure-associated 
disorders. Moreover, our finding that alterations in ΔFosB and calbindin expression correlate 
with MMSE scores in MCI, but not AD, patients suggests that possible therapeutic 
interventions targeting either protein should be initiated as early as possible to maximize 
effectiveness. The association of MMSE scores with ΔFosB and calbindin in MCI patients 
might be explained by the fact that hippocampal dysfunction, to which alterations in ΔFosB 
and calbindin expression greatly contribute, is particularly prominent in early disease. 
However, as AD progresses, disease pathophysiology in additional brain areas also 
contributes to overall cognitive dysfunction. The results of our study are consistent with a 
growing body of evidence showing that seizures occurring in early stages of AD impair 
memory and exacerbate cognitive decline18,19. The prevalence of seizures in AD may also 
be much greater than previously thought, as routine scalp EEG has been shown to miss 
“silent” hippocampal seizures detected via foramen ovale electrodes in AD patients34. 
Finally, some evidence suggests that calbindin reduction in granule cells following 
epileptiform activity may confer neuroprotection against excitotoxicity35,36 (but also

 see37,38). Demonstration of calbindin suppression by ΔFosB may provide further support for 
a neuroprotective role of calbindin reduction in granule cells, since previous studies have 
shown that both ΔFosB and HDAC1 can protect neurons from neurotoxic injury39,40. 
Interestingly however, we did not find obvious neuronal loss when we blocked ΔFosB 
signaling or virally expressed calbindin in APP mice (see Fig. 3d,f), which may be related to 
the time frame of our experiments or the possible existence of redundant neuroprotective 
mechanisms. Regardless, a potential trade-off between neuroprotection and synaptic 
function may emphasize caution for therapeutics targeting either pathway, as efforts to 
augment one pathway may generate side effects by simultaneously altering the other. To 
validate the therapeutic potential of targeting ΔFosB and/or calbindin, future studies will 
need to further characterize their functions in the hippocampus.
Methods
Mice
Heterozygous APP transgenic mice expressing human APP carrying the Swedish (K670N, 
M671L) and Indiana (V717F) familial AD mutations (hAPP770 numbering) driven by the 
platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) β chain promoter (Line J20)16 were used in this 
study. The line was crossed for >10 generations onto a C57BL/6 background, and 
heterozygosity was maintained by breeding with wild-type C57BL/6 mice from The Jackson 
Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Male and female mice from this line were used for 
experiments, and were evaluated at 2-4 months of age. At this age, many APP mice exhibit 
both recurrent seizures and cognitive deficits, but no plaque deposits17. Age- and sex-
matched nontransgenic (NTG) wild-type animals from the same line were used as controls.
Wild-type C57BL/6 mice from The Jackson Laboratory were used at 2-4 months of age for 
AAV-ΔFosB overexpression experiments (see AAV-mediated gene transfer). Wild-type 
C57BL/6 mice from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA) were used at 2 months 
of age for pilocarpine experiments (see Pilocarpine-induced seizures).
For sacrifice, mice were anesthetized and perfused transcardially with PBS. Hemibrains 
were either fixed by immersion in 4% phosphate-buffered paraformaldehyde and sectioned 
at 30 μm (in preparation for in situ hybridization or immunohistochemistry) or frozen at 
-80°C (for chromatin immunoprecipitation). All procedures were approved by the 
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of Thomas Jefferson University, Baylor 
College of Medicine, and The Nathan Kline Institute.
Pilocarpine-induced seizures
Mice were initially administered scopolamine methyl nitrate (2 mg/kg sc; Sigma-Aldrich) 
and terbutaline hemisulfate salt (2 mg/kg sc; Sigma-Aldrich) to block peripheral effects of 
pilocarpine and dilate the respiratory tract, respectively. They also received 150 mg/kg 
ethosuximide sc (Sigma-Aldrich), as we have found that it improved mortality in C57BL/6 
mice41. Thirty min later, pilocarpine hydrochloride (260 mg/kg sc; Sigma-Aldrich) was 
administered, and mice were placed in a standard mouse cage without bedding on a heating 
pad set at 37°C. Acute seizures were behaviorally monitored using a modified Racine's

 scale: stage 1, mouth and facial movement; stage 2, head nodding; stage 3, rearing with 
unilateral forelimb tonic-clonic movements; stage 4, rearing with bilateral forelimb tonic-
clonic movements; stage 5, rearing and falling with tonic-clonic movements of the 
forelimbs. Once status epilepticus began (defined by the first stage 3-5 seizure that was not 
followed by resumption of normal behavior), mice were placed in a new cage at room 
temperature for 2 hrs and returned to the heated cage after seizure activity was reduced with 
diazepam (10 mg/kg sc; Henry Schein). Mice were then administered 5% dextrose-lactated 
Ringer's solution (1 mL ip; Henry Schein) while sedated by diazepam. After 2 hrs animals 
were then returned to the home cage, which was placed on the heating pad until sacrifice 3 
days later.
Human tissue
Fixed dentate gyrus samples from AD and MCI patients were obtained from the Alzheimer's 
Disease Research Center at the University of California San Diego (San Diego, CA), 
sectioned at 60 μm, and stained for ΔFosB and calbindin (see Diaminobenzidine staining) 
after antigen retrieval with citrate buffer and formic acid. Fixed dentate gyrus samples from 
temporal lobe epilepsy patients were obtained and used with informed consent under IRB 
protocol H-10255, using epilepsy surgery resection specimens derived from adult patients 
treated at Baylor College of Medicine (Houston, TX). Sections were deparaffinized, 
subjected to antigen retrieval as above, and then stained for ΔFosB and calbindin.
AAV-mediated gene transfer
AAV serotype 2 carrying CMV-ΔJunD-IRES2-eGFP (AAV-ΔJunD), CMV-ΔFosB-IRES2-
eGFP (AAV-ΔFosB), or CMV-eGFP (AAV-eGFP) was developed and characterized by the 
Nestler lab20. Previous experiments demonstrate that AAV2 is neurotropic and achieves 
stable neuronal gene expression within 18-22 days of infusion into the brain. The presence 
of IRES2 in AAV-ΔFosB and AAV-ΔJunD allows independent expression of ΔFosB or 
ΔJunD and eGFP, although there is preferential expression of the gene closest to the 
promoter. AAV serotype 2 carrying CMV-mCalb1-IRES2-eGFP (AAV-Calb1) was 
synthesized by Vector Biolabs (Philadelphia, PA).
One μL of virus solution was stereotaxically infused unilaterally or bilaterally into the 
hippocampus at rostral (-1.7 mm A/P, 1.2 mm M/L, 2 mm D/V from bregma) and caudal 
(-2.7 mm A/P, 2 mm M/L, 2.1 mm D/V from bregma) coordinates. Approximately 2×108 
infectious particles were infused into each hippocampus. Mice were allowed to recover for 
22-28 days post-surgery before further experimentation or sacrifice. Virus expression was 
assessed in all mice. Mice that did not exhibit expression in the hippocampus were excluded 
from analysis.
Object location
Object location is a dentate gyrus-dependent spatial memory test27 that requires that mice 
learn and remember the positions of two objects in an arena. Extra-arena spatial cues exist to 
help orient the mice during the train and test phases. For training, two identical flasks were 
placed at adjacent far corners of the arena (Fig. 2h), and animals were allowed to explore 
both flasks in 3 blocks of 3 min each with 3 min breaks in between. The amount of time

 mice spent exploring each flask was recorded by the experimenter. After a delay of 2 hrs, 
mice were returned to the arena for the test phase. In this phase, we displaced one flask to 
the adjacent empty corner, causing the two flasks to be diagonal from one another. Mice 
were given 3 minutes to explore both flasks, and the amount of time spent exploring each 
flask was recorded. Mice that remember the original locations of the two flasks will spend 
more time exploring the displaced flask vs. the non-displaced flask during the test phase. 
Previous studies have shown that both animal models of AD and epilepsy are impaired in 
this task28,29.
Electroencephalogram (EEG) recording
Mice were stereotaxically implanted with a 6-electrode array headcap for EEG monitoring: 
Two EEG screws were placed bilaterally over the left and right frontal cortices (AP: +1.5, 
ML: +/- 1.4), and a depth electrode was placed in right hippocampus (AP: -2.2, ML: -2, DV: 
-1.8). In addition, a reference screw and a depth ground electrode were placed over and 
inside cerebellum, respectively. Finally, an EEG screw was placed over parietal cortex (AP: 
-2.2, ML: -2) for additional anchor. All EEG screws were wrapped with silver wires 
connected to a pedestal (Plastics One, Roanoke, VA), and the entire assembly was secured 
on the skull with dental cement (Ortho-Jet, LangDental, Wheeling, IL). Animals were 
allowed to recover for at least 4 days prior to commencement of recordings.
For EEG recordings, a flexible cable connected the animals' headcaps to a commutator thus 
allowing them to move freely during the recordings. Video-monitored EEG recordings were 
performed in the animals' home cage using a Stellate Harmonie (Natus Medical, Pleasanton, 
CA) interface. Spike count analysis was performed using LabChart Pro (AD Instruments, 
Dunedin, NZ).
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
Whole hippocampi were subdissected, fixed in 1% formaldehyde for 15 min, and 
homogenized in a 0.5% NP40 cell lysis buffer using Potter-Elvehjem PTFE tissue grinders. 
Nuclei were subsequently pelleted and reconstituted in 1% SDS. Nuclear lysis was 
accomplished via repetitive freeze-thaw, and chromatin shearing followed via the Digital 
SLP probe sonifier (Branson Ultrasonics) or Q800R bath sonicator (QSonica). Both methods 
of sonication were calibrated to produce fragment sizes 100-600 bp (with a primary peak at 
200 bp), detected via ethidium bromide gel. Afterwards, ChIP was performed using the 
Magna ChIP A Kit (Millipore). ChIP antibodies were used at 2 μg, and included rabbit anti-
ΔFosB (Cell Signaling 9890 and D3S8R), rabbit anti-H3K9+K14+K18+K23+K27ac 
(Abcam ab47915), rabbit anti-H4K5+K8+K12+K16ac (Millipore 06-866), rabbit anti-
H3K9me2 (Abcam ab1220), rabbit anti-H3K9me3 (Millipore 07-442), rabbit anti-
H4K20me3 (Millipore 07-463), and normal rabbit IgG (Millipore 12-370). Prior to the 
addition of antibody, 2% of the sheared chromatin was set aside as input. Following ChIP, 
immunoprecipitated chromatin was eluted using 0.1M NaHCO3 and 1% SDS. Next, protein 
was digested using 0.1 mg/mL proteinase K, and DNA was separated using phenol-
chloroform extraction. DNA was then pelleted and washed twice using 70% ethanol, and 
reconstituted in MilliQ H2O. Calb1 promoter enrichment was analyzed using qPCR of ChIP 
DNA versus input. Primers for Calb1 promoter amplification are as follows: 5′-

Diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining
Brain sections were avidin-biotin/immunoperoxidase labeled using the following primary 
antibodies: rabbit anti-ΔFosB (1:300, Cell Signaling 9890), rabbit anti-calbindin (1:15,000, 
Swant CB-38A), rabbit anti-JunD (1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-74). Biotinylated 
goat anti-rabbit (1:200, Vector BA-1000) was used as the secondary antibody. DAB was 
used as the chromagen. For analysis of immunoreactive (IR) structures, two coronal sections 
(300 μm apart) were selected per mouse between -2.54 and -2.88 mm from bregma. The 
integrated optical density (IOD) of immunostains was determined using the MetaMorph 
Image Analysis Software (Molecular Devices) and averaged in two areas (0.04 mm2 each) of 
either the molecular (calbindin) or granule cell layer (ΔFosB) of the dentate gyrus (DG) and 
stratum radiatum of CA1. Relative IR was thus expressed as the IOD ratio in the DG versus 
CA1. The mean ratio of nontransgenic (NTG) mice was defined as 1. For quantification of 
ΔFosB and calbindin in fixed human dentate gyrus, IR values were background corrected 
using comparison with nonspecific staining in a nearby acellular white matter tract.
Immunofluorescence staining
All brain sections within an experiment were processed, stained, and imaged at the same 
time, with the same parameters. Brain sections were fluorescently labeled using the 
following primary antibodies: rabbit anti-ΔFosB (1:100, Cell Signaling 9890; 1:1000, Cell 
Signaling D3S8R), mouse anti-calbindin (1:1000, Swant 300), mouse anti-NeuN (1:5000, 
Millipore MAB377), goat anti-cFos (1:300, Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-52g). 
Fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies utilized in this study included donkey anti-
rabbit AMCA (1:200, Jackson ImmunoResearch 711-155-152), donkey anti-goat Cy3 
(1:200, Jackson ImmunoResearch 705-165-147), donkey anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 594 
(1:500, Life Technologies A-21203), donkey anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 (1:500, Life 
Technologies A-21206). For analysis of calbindin-IR, ΔFosB-IR, and NeuN-IR structures, 
fluorescence intensity (FI) was determined in the DG molecular (calbindin) or granule cell 
layer (ΔFosB, NeuN, and calbindin) in every 10th serial coronal section throughout the 
rostral-caudal extent of the hippocampus using MetaMorph Image Analysis Software. FI of 
CA1 stratum radiatum was obtained in the same sections. Relative IR was expressed as the 
FI ratio in the DG versus CA1. The mean ratio of NTG mice was defined as 1. For analysis 
of cFos-IR, fluorescently labeled cells were counted in the granule cell layer in every 10th 
serial coronal section throughout the rostral-caudal extent of the hippocampus. For cell-by-
cell analysis of ΔFosB-IR and calbindin-IR, ΔFosB and calbindin FI were determined for 
individual cells via ImageJ (NIH). Random blocks of 8-10 adjacent cells from rostral 
hippocampal sections (-1.6 mm from bregma) of APP and pilocarpine-treated mice were 
chosen for quantification. The mean FI for both proteins was defined as 1.
In situ hybridization (ISH)
All solutions used to process brain sections designated for ISH were pretreated with DEPC 
and/or autoclaved to minimize RNA degradation. Non-sterile tools and surfaces were also 
pretreated with RNase Zap (Ambion). ISH-competent free-floating brain sections were

 digested with 1 ug/mL proteinase K for 12 min before overnight hybridization at 65°C with 
digoxygenin-labeled full-length antisense riboprobe for mouse Calb1 (synthesized from 
Calb1 cDNA, IMAGE cat# MMM1013-202766730). Sense and no probe controls were 
included. The sections were then washed once with 5× SSC/0.5% Tween20 and 7 times with 
0.2× SSC/0.5% Tween20. This is followed by blocking with 10% heat-inactivated sheep 
serum and overnight incubation with 1:5000 alkaline phosphatase-conjugated sheep anti-
digoxigenin antibody (Roche 11333089001) at 4°C. Development a blue/purple stain for 
colorimetric detection was achieved via incubation with the chromogen NBT/BCIP (Roche) 
for 3 hrs at room temperature. Sections were then washed in PBS/EDTA and fixed with 4% 
paraformaldehyde for 10 min before mounting onto slides. Determination of Calb1 mRNA 
signal was performed via IOD analysis of the DG granule cell layer, similar to IOD analysis 
for DAB staining.
Statistics
Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS-23 (IBM) and Prism 7 (GraphPad). Sample 
sizes for both biochemical and behavioral experiments were determined based on 
calculations performed on empirical data and power analyses. The number of animals used 
for each experiment was appropriate to detect biochemical or behavioral differences with 
80% power and alpha set at 0.05. Unless otherwise stated, results are represented as sample 
means ± standard errors of the mean. These data are distributed normally as stipulated by the 
central limit theorem. Differences between experimental groups were assessed by Student's 
t-test (two-tailed except where indicated as one-tailed) when comparing means between two 
groups, paired t-test when comparing means within the same individuals, one-way ANOVA 
when comparing means between three or more groups, two-way ANOVA when performing 
multifactorial analyses, and the Welch's F test when data failed the Levene's test for 
homogeneity of variances. Post-hoc analyses were used where appropriate. Correlations 
were assessed by simple regression analysis. No specific method of randomization was used, 
but animals were semi-randomly assigned to experimental groups based on birth order after 
balancing for age, sex, and genotype. We found no differences in the ΔFosB/calbindin 
relationship between male and female mice, therefore both sexes were included in 
experiments (ΔFosB two-way ANOVA: genotype F1,55=24.41, ***p<0.0001; sex 
F1,55=0.39, p=0.53; interaction F1,55=1.35, p=0.25; calbindin two-way ANOVA: genotype 
F1,55=48.78, ***p<0.0001; sex F1,55=0.049, p=0.83; interaction F1,55=0.0014, p=0.97). For 
all analyses, the experimenters were blinded to the genotype and treatment type of each 
mouse. In vivo and ChIP experiments were replicated at least once, immunohistochemical 
experiments were replicated at least twice.
Further detailed information on experimental design and reagents can be found in the Life 
Sciences Reporting Summary.
