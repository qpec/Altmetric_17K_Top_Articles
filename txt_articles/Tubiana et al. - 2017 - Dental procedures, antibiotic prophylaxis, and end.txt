ABSTRACT
OBJECTIVE
To assess the relation between invasive dental 
procedures and infective endocarditis associated with 
oral streptococci among people with prosthetic heart 
valves.
DESIGN
Nationwide population based cohort and a case 
crossover study.
SETTING
French national health insurance administrative data 
linked with the national hospital discharge database.
PARTICIPANTS
All adults aged more than 18 years, living in France, 
with medical procedure codes for positioning or 
replacement of prosthetic heart valves between July 
2008 and July 2014.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Oral streptococcal infective endocarditis was 
identified using primary discharge diagnosis codes. 
In the cohort study, Poisson regression models were 
performed to estimate the rate of oral streptococcal 
infective endocarditis during the three month period 
after invasive dental procedures compared with 
non-exposure periods. In the case crossover study, 
conditional logistic regression models calculated the 
odds ratio and 95% confidence intervals comparing 
exposure to invasive dental procedures during the 
three month period preceding oral streptococcal 
infective endocarditis (case period) with three earlier 
control periods.
RESULTS
The cohort included 138 876 adults with prosthetic 
heart valves (285 034 person years); 69 303 (49.9%) 
underwent at least one dental procedure. Among 
the 396 615 dental procedures performed, 103 463 
(26.0%) were invasive and therefore presented an 
indication for antibiotic prophylaxis, which was 
performed in 52 280 (50.1%). With a median follow-
up of 1.7 years, 267 people developed infective 
endocarditis associated with oral streptococci 
(incidence rate 93.7 per 100 000 person years, 95% 
confidence interval 82.4 to 104.9). Compared with 
non-exposure periods, no statistically significant 
increased rate of oral streptococcal infective 
endocarditis was observed during the three months 
after an invasive dental procedure (relative rate 1.25, 
95% confidence interval 0.82 to 1.82; P=0.26) and 
after an invasive dental procedure without antibiotic 
prophylaxis (1.57, 0.90 to 2.53; P=0.08). In the 
case crossover analysis, exposure to invasive dental 
procedures was more frequent during case periods 
than during matched control periods (5.1% v 3.2%; 
odds ratio 1.66, 95% confidence interval 1.05 to 2.63; 
P=0.03).
CONCLUSION
Invasive dental procedures may contribute to the 
development of infective endocarditis in adults with 
prosthetic heart valves.
Introduction
Infective endocarditis is a rare but severe disease 
with an in-hospital mortality rate of about 20% and 
a five year mortality rate of 40%.1 This disease is 
also associated with high morbidity and a high cost 
burden, as the treatment of infective endocarditis 
requires prolonged hospital stay, and one out of 
two patients undergoes valve surgery during the 
acute phase of the disease.2 Strategies for antibiotic 
prophylaxis against infective endocarditis have been 
proposed for many years for patients with heart 
disease at risk of infective endocarditis undergoing 
invasive procedures responsible for bacteraemia,34 
despite the lack of proof of efficacy: neither 
randomised clinical trials (providing the highest level 
of evidence) nor cohorts studies have been conducted 
to support an antibiotic prophylaxis strategy. Over 
the past three decades five case-control studies have 
been conducted5-9; only two of them established 
an association between dental procedures and 
streptococcal infective endocarditis and none of them 
was sufficiently powered to establish the efficacy of 
antibiotic prophylaxis.

WhAT IS AlReAdy knoWn on ThIS TopIC
Current data suggest that everyday life bacteraemia (induced by, for example, 
tooth brushing, chewing) may more likely be responsible for infective 
endocarditis than bacteraemia induced by invasive dental procedures
Frequency and intensity of everyday life and post-procedure bacteraemia are 
higher in patients with poor oral hygiene and periodontal diseases
Efficacy of infective endocarditis antibiotic prophylaxis in patients with predisposing 
cardiac conditions undergoing invasive dental procedures is still debated

Incidence of oral streptococcal infective endocarditis in relation to everyday life 
bacteraemia is 94.6 per 100 000 person years (95% confidence interval 82.5 to

In addition to the lack of scientific evidence of 
efficacy for an antibiotic prophylaxis strategy,10 
statistical modelling showed that “everyday low 
level bacteraemia” that occurs after tooth brushing, 
flossing, or chewing (and not covered by antibiotic 
prophylaxis) may more frequently trigger oral 
streptococcal infective endocarditis bacteraemia than 
invasive dental procedures.11-16 On the basis of these 
hypotheses, the indications for antibiotic prophylaxis 
have been restricted to two different strategies in 
all guidelines over the past decade. The 2007 US17 
and 2009/2015 European guidelines4 18 recommend 
antibiotic prophylaxis only in patients with prosthetic 
heart valves, a history of infective endocarditis, or 
congenital cyanotic heart disease undergoing invasive 
dental procedures, whereas the UK 2008 NICE 
guidelines19 recommend that antibiotic prophylaxis 
should be withheld from all patients for all procedures.
However, a trend towards an increased incidence of 
infective endocarditis has been reported in some studies 
from the US and Germany after implementation of the 
2007-09 guidelines and in the UK after the 2008 NICE 
guidelines, highlighting the possible role of invasive 
dental procedures in the development of infective 
endocarditis.20-22 In the UK this increased incidence, 
reported in 2015 in various patient groups, was 
observed in those with prosthetic heart valves who no 
longer received antibiotic prophylaxis before invasive 
dental procedures. Despite discordant findings from 
other studies23-25 these results raised the question of 
whether the indications for antibiotic prophylaxis may 
be broadened again. Although NICE guidelines were 
not modified immediately following this publication, 
the 2016 guidelines clearly specified that “antibiotic 
prophylaxis may be appropriate in individual cases.”26
We 
assessed 
the 
relation 
between 
invasive 
dental procedures and oral streptococcal infective 
endocarditis and evaluated the role of antibiotic 
prophylaxis, using a nationwide population based 
cohort and a case crossover study.
Methods
Data source
This study was based on health administrative data 
obtained from the French National Health Insurance 
general scheme covering approximately 50 million 
people linked with the national hospital discharge 
database (SNIIRAM-PMSI) by means of a unique 
anonymous identifier, as previously described.2728 
The present study was based on data from January 
2006 to December 2014 and is reported according to 
STROBE (statement for reporting case-control studies) 
guidelines.29
Identification of participants
We identified participants as those with a prosthetic 
heart valve using specific medical procedure codes for 
positioning or replacement of prosthetic heart valves 
(see supplementary file for list of codes) or one of 
the following ICD-10 (international classification of 
diseases, 10th revision) codes for hospital discharge 
diagnoses: presence of prosthetic heart valve (Z95.2), 
infection and inflammatory reaction due to cardiac 
valve prosthesis (T82.6), or mechanical complication 
of heart valve prosthesis (T82.0).
Study design
Cohort study
We carried out a nationwide population based cohort 
study to assess the rate of infective endocarditis 
associated with oral streptococci during the three 
months after invasive dental procedures according 
to different categories of exposure. This three month 
interval was based on data from previous studies 
reporting long intervals between dental procedures 
and the diagnosis of infective endocarditis, and data 
from the literature.30 31
Participants entered the cohort six months after the 
date of first identification of a prosthetic heart valve 
during the study period to ensure analysis under stable 
conditions. To be included in the cohort, patients had 
to be aged 18 years or older with no discharge diagnosis 
code for oral streptococcal infective endocarditis or 
other specific codes related to prosthetic heart valve 
before inclusion in the cohort (fig 1).
We followed up participants from the time of 
inclusion in the cohort until the study outcome (oral 
streptococcal infective endocarditis), or hospital 
admission for valve replacement, or death from 
any cause, or discontinuation of follow-up (defined 
as more than six months with no reimbursement 
claims for any healthcare procedures), or end of the 
study period (December 2014), whichever occurred 
first.
Case crossover study
To control for potential residual confounders, we also 
carried out a case crossover study, in which participants 
with a prosthetic heart valve and oral streptococcal 
infective endocarditis (ie, cases) served as their own 
controls during a preceding period. In this study, we 
selected all participants with prosthetic heart valve, 
as previously defined, admitted to hospital for the first 
time with a discharge diagnosis of oral streptococcal 
infective endocarditis between January 2009 and 
December 2014. These participants constituted the 
case population whether or not they were included 
in the cohort study. For each case we compared the 
presence or absence of invasive dental procedures 
during the three months immediately preceding oral 
streptococcal infective endocarditis (case period) with 
the presence or absence of invasive dental procedures 
during earlier control periods (months 9 to 7 before, 
months 15 to 13 before, and months 21 to 19 before) 
in the same participants. This method implicitly takes 
into account all measured and unmeasured time 
independent confounding factors (including oral 
hygiene) and can be used to investigate associations 
between transient exposures and acute outcome 
events.32
To avoid carryover effects we separated case and 
controls periods from each other by a three month

washout period. To be included in the case crossover 
study, cases had to have been followed for at least nine 
months before onset of oral streptococcal infective 
endocarditis (to allow the analysis of at least one case 
and one control period separated by a washout period). 
Figure 2 summarises the study design.
Identification of dental procedures
For each participant we identified dental procedures in 
the SNIIRAM database. According to the respective codes 
(see list in supplementary material), dental procedures 
were classified as invasive when they required 
manipulation of the gingival or periapical region of 
the teeth or perforation of the oral mucosa (excluding 
local anaesthetic injection), as recommended by 2015 
European guidelines; these invasive procedures require 
antibiotic prophylaxis. Other dental procedures were 
classified as non-invasive. Two dentists, blinded to 
study results, determined the correspondence between 
codes and classification.
Identification of antibiotic prophylaxis
As antibiotic prophylaxis before invasive dental 
procedure was not recorded in the SNIIRAM database, 
we considered antibiotic prophylaxis preceding the 
dental procedure when the participants had an antibiotic

treatment (see supplementary file for list) active against 
oral streptococci dispensed by pharmacists in the 
21 days before the dental procedure, irrespective of 
whether the procedure was invasive or non-invasive. 
This 21 day interval was based on a previous survey 
conducted among 585 dentists, which showed that 
84% of practitioners prescribed antibiotic treatment 
during the two weeks before the dental procedure.33
Definition of exposure
Initially we classified exposure into two categories 
according to whether the dental procedure was invasive 
or non-invasive. When both types of procedure were 
reported for the same period for a given participant, we 
prioritised the invasive procedure.
We then subdivided these periods into two categories 
according to the use of antibiotic prophylaxis, resulting 
in four categories: invasive dental procedure with 
antibiotic prophylaxis, invasive procedure without 
antibiotic prophylaxis, non-invasive procedure with 
antibiotic prophylaxis, and non-invasive procedure 
without antibiotic prophylaxis.
Definition of oral streptococcal infective 
endocarditis
We defined oral streptococcal infective endocarditis as 
the first hospital admission between January 2009 and 
December 2014 with a primary discharge diagnosis 
of infective endocarditis using ICD-10 codes (I33.0 
for acute and subacute infective endocarditis, I33.9 
for acute and subacute endocarditis, unspecified) 
combined with at least one secondary discharge 
diagnosis of streptococcal infection due to non-A, 
non-B, non-pneumococcal streptococcus (ICD-10 codes 
A40.8, A40.9, A49.1, B95.4, B95.5) as performed in a 
previous study.34 This algorithm was used because no 
codes are available for oral streptococci. We excluded 
patients admitted to hospital with a primary discharge 
diagnosis of infective endocarditis but with no 
identified microorganism.
To evaluate the sensitivity and positive predictive 
value of this algorithm for identification of cases with 
oral streptococcal infective endocarditis, two of the 
authors (ST, XD) reviewed the medical records of 130 
patients admitted to a tertiary care hospital between 
2008 and 2014 with at least one positive blood culture 
result for oral streptococci.
Confounding variables
In the SNIIRAM database we identified potential 
baseline confounding factors known to be related to 
infective endocarditis: in the year before cohort entry the 
presence of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator or 
pacemaker, intravenous drug use, dialysis dependence, 
and diabetes (see supplementary file for codes).
Statistical analysis
For the cohort analysis, we calculated the crude 
incidence rates (number of outcomes divided by 
cumulative person years) of oral streptococcal 
infective endocarditis per 100 000 person years for the 
different exposure categories. Poisson regression was 
used to calculate the adjusted relative rate estimates 
of oral streptococcal infective endocarditis for the 
different categories of exposure. We used two models 
successively: the first model (the dental procedures 
model) used the two exposure categories, and the 
second model (the antibiotic prophylaxis dental 
procedures model) used the four exposure categories 
according to antibiotic prophylaxis use. Both models 
were adjusted for all potential baseline confounding 
factors.
For the case crossover analysis, we used conditional 
logistic regression to estimate the odds ratio during 
the case period compared with the matched control 
periods. We used two models according to the different 
exposure categories (two or four). As the temporal 
trend of dental procedures remained stable throughout 
the control periods, we did not perform any case-time 
control analyses.
For all analyses we considered non-exposure to 
be the reference group. Interaction tests using the 
formula of Altman and Bland35 were calculated to 
estimate the interaction effect between invasive and 
non-invasive dental procedures; we considered P<0.05 
to be statistically significant. Statistical analyses were 
performed with SAS 9.4 software (SAS Institute, Cary, 
NC).
Patient involvement
No patients were involved in setting the research 
question or the outcome measures, nor were they 
involved in developing plans for recruitment, design, 
or implementation of the study. No patients were asked 
to advise on interpretation or writing up of results. 
There are no plans to provide study participants or 
the relevant patient community with the results of this 
study.

Cohort study
Participant characteristics
The cohort comprised 138 876 people with prosthetic 
heart valves, with 82 217 (59.2%) men and a median 
age of 74 years (interquartile range 63-80 years; fig 3). 
Table 1 presents the baseline characteristics of the 
cohort.
Incidence of oral streptococcal infective endocarditis 
and exposure to dental procedures
Participants were followed up for a median of 1.7 years 
(interquartile range 0.6-3.2 years). Among the 285 034 
person years, 267 cases of oral streptococcal infective 
endocarditis were reported, corresponding to an 
overall crude incidence rate of 93.7 cases per 100 000 
person years (95% confidence interval 82.4 to 104.9 
cases per 100 000 person years).
Among the 138 876 participants, 69 303 (49.9%) 
had at least one dental visit with an invasive or non-
invasive dental procedure, with a median of 2.0 visits 
per participant per year (interquartile range 0.8-5.6 
visits per participant per year). Overall, during the

follow-up period, 396 615 dental procedures were 
performed in the 138 876 participants, 103 463 
(26.0%) of which were classified as invasive 
procedures requiring antibiotic prophylaxis (table 2). 
During the preceding 21 days, antibiotic prophylaxis 
was dispensed in 52 280 (50.1%) of these invasive 
procedures. The cumulative exposure period to dental 
procedures corresponded to 36 490 person years and 
the non-exposure period to 248 544 person years.
During the period of non-exposure to dental 
procedures, the incidence rate of oral streptococcal 
infective endocarditis was 94.6 per 100 000 person 
years (95% confidence interval 82.5 to 106.6 per 
100 000 person years). Irrespective of antibiotic 
prophylaxis, the incidence of oral streptococcal 
infective endocarditis varied from 72.9 per 100 000 
person years (39.2 to 106.6) during the three months 
after a non-invasive dental procedure to 118.5 per 
100 000 person years (56.4 to 180.6) during the three 
months after an invasive dental procedure. The overall 
rate of oral streptococcal infective endocarditis was 
1.4 cases per 10 000 invasive dental procedures.
When we subdivided exposure periods according 
to the use of antibiotic prophylaxis, incidence rates of 
oral streptococcal infective endocarditis varied from 
78.1 per 100 000 person years (1.6 to 154.6) during 
the three months after an invasive dental procedure 
with antibiotic prophylaxis to 149.5 per 100 000 
person years (56.8 to 242.2) during the three months 
after an invasive dental procedure without antibiotic 
prophylaxis (table 2).
Association between dental procedures and oral 
streptococcal infective endocarditis
Table 2 shows the crude incidence rate ratios of oral 
streptococcal infective endocarditis for the different 
exposure categories compared with the non-exposure 
period.
In the dental procedures model, after adjustment 
for potential baseline confounding factors (sex, age, 
presence of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator 
or pacemaker, diabetes, intravenous drug use, dialysis 
dependent), the rate of oral streptococcal infective

compared with the non-exposure period (fully adjusted 
relative rate 1.25, 95% confidence interval 0.82 to 
1.82; P=0.26); the difference between invasive and 
non-invasive dental procedures was not statistically 
significant (P=0.07 for interaction; table 2).
In the antibiotic prophylaxis dental procedures 
model, no statistically significant difference was 
observed for the rate of oral streptococcal infective 
endocarditis after an invasive dental procedure 
without antibiotic prophylaxis compared with the non-
exposure period (fully adjusted relative rate 1.57, 0.90 
to 2.53; P=0.08).
Case crossover study
Of the 2011 participants admitted to hospital for 
the first time with a primary discharge diagnosis 
of infective endocarditis during the study period, 
648 were included in the case crossover study 
with oral streptococcal infective endocarditis (see 
supplementary figure S1), with 69.7% of men and a 
median age of 77 (interquartile range 68-82) years.
Exposure to dental procedures
Among these 648 cases, 94 (14.5%) had at least one 
dental procedure during the three months preceding 
oral streptococcal infective endocarditis: 61 (9.4%) of 
them had undergone a non-invasive procedure and 33 
(5.1%) an invasive procedure. An effective antibiotic 
treatment was dispensed during the preceding 21 
days for 19 (57.6%) of the 33 participants who had 
undergone an invasive dental procedure (table 3).
The overall frequency of dental procedures was 
13.3% during the control periods, with 10.1% of non-
invasive procedures and 3.2% of invasive procedures. 
Supplementary table S1 shows the distribution of 
concordant and discordant matched pairs for the 
presence or absence of dental procedures during the 
case and control periods. One of the key assumptions 
of this approach was verified by confirming that there 
was no evidence of an exposure time trend during the 
21 months before the event date (see supplementary 
figure S2).
Association between dental procedures and oral 
streptococcal infective endocarditis

Validation of ICD-10 coding for oral streptococcal 
infective endocarditis
The study definition of oral streptococcal infective 
endocarditis validated using medical records of 130 
participants admitted to hospital with at least one 
positive blood culture result for oral streptococci had 
a sensitivity of 54% and a positive predictive value of 
100%.
discussion
This study, combining analyses of a large cohort of 
patients with prosthetic heart valves and of a case 
crossover study, shows that invasive dental procedures 
may contribute to the development of infective 
endocarditis in this population of patients known to 
present a high incidence of this disease and to be at 
high risk of morbidity and mortality associated with the 
disease. However, a statistically significant reduction 
in the rate of developing infective endocarditis after 
such procedures was not observed among those 
participants receiving antibiotic prophylaxis.
The cohort was large, comprising 138 876 partici-
pants with prosthetic heart valves, which represents 
approximately two thirds of the corresponding French 
population based on our previous estimations.36 The 
availability of a large cohort is of particular impor-
tance in the study of infective endocarditis in view of 
the low incidence of this disease. External comparison 
is difficult because no similar information is available 
from other sources or other countries. Given the se-
lection process, there is no reason to believe that this 
study population is not representative of the entire 
population with prosthetic heart valves; the results of 
this study can therefore be extrapolated to the larger 
population.
The analysis of the cohort provides original data 
in this population of participants with prosthetic 
heart valves, with high exposure to dental procedures 
(396 615 procedures) but which varied considerably 
from one participant to another, as only half of the 
cohort received dental care during the mean follow-
up of 1.7 years, despite the recommendation to visit a 
dentist twice yearly.
In addition, only one half of invasive procedures 
(one quarter of all dental procedures) were associated 
with antibiotic prophylaxis, despite recommendations. 
This is a low proportion but consistent with other 
reports in France.9
In this cohort of participants with prosthetic 
heart valves, the incidence of infective endocarditis, 
regardless of the microorganism (840 cases per 
100 000 person years, data not shown) and the risk 
of developing oral streptococcal infective endocarditis 
after an invasive dental procedure (1.4 out of 10 000), 
were both in the same range as the incidence rates 
reported in the literature.36
Interestingly, for the first time in this population 
the cohort provides an estimate for the incidence of 
oral streptococcal infective endocarditis in relation to 
everyday life bacteraemia (ie, oral hygiene habits such 
as tooth brushing, use of toothpicks, flossing, or chew-
ing) during non-exposure periods. The microtrauma 
caused by these everyday activities has been identified 
to induce oral streptococcal bacteraemia, in fairly sim-
ilar proportions to those of invasive oral procedures 
for which antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended.37 
The fact that the cumulative non-exposure periods 
were much longer than the exposure periods (248 544 
person years v 36 490 person years, ie, seven times 
higher) strongly suggests that most cases of infective 
endocarditis are due to everyday life bacteraemia, 
which is consistent with the results of the case cross-
over study, reporting a history of dental procedures in 
the three months preceding infective endocarditis in 
only a small number of participants.
This cohort shows that the incidence of oral 
streptococcal infective endocarditis during the three 
months after an invasive dental procedure was higher, 
but not statistically significantly higher, in participants 
not receiving the recommended antibiotic prophylaxis. 
However, the analysis performed in this cohort is 
based on pooled data derived from a heterogeneous 
population of patients in terms of use of dental care 
(measured in our database) and certainly in terms of 
oral hygiene and dental status (not measured in our 
database), which represent a potential source of bias9 
in the non-exposure periods.
The case crossover study may ensure better control 
for these confounding factors (individual oral hygiene

and dental status), as each participant constituted 
his or her own control. The case crossover analysis 
including 648 participants with oral streptococcal 
infective endocarditis showed a statistically significant 
association between invasive dental procedures and 
oral streptococcal infective endocarditis. Using the 
same case crossover design in 170 participants with 
infective endocarditis, one study did not observe 
any statistically significant difference in the number 
and type of dental procedures performed during the 
three month period before admission for infective 
endocarditis compared with control periods.38 However, 
only 49 viridans streptococci were analysed and 44% 
of participants had a prosthetic heart valve. Similarly, 
in a recent case crossover study based on Taiwan’s 
national health insurance programme, one study 
reported that dental procedures did not increase the risk 
of infective endocarditis.31 However, only 125 patients 
with infective endocarditis with valvular heart disease 
(proportion of patients with prosthetic heart valves not 
specified) were included in the analysis and no data were 
available concerning the microorganisms responsible 
for infective endocarditis. The small numbers of cases 
with streptococcal infective endocarditis in these two 
studies limited the statistical power of the analyses.
In our case crossover analysis we found a low rate 
of invasive dental procedures during the three months 
preceding oral streptococcal infective endocarditis 
(5.1%, but consistent with the literature) showing that 
most cases of streptococcal infective endocarditis were 
not associated with recent dental procedures. Notably, 
this case crossover analysis was not affected by recall 
bias, as dental procedures were retrieved from the 
SNIIRAM database. In a recently published case-control 
study performed in patients with infective endocarditis 
admitted to hospital in six French tertiary care hospitals 
(regardless of predisposing heart conditions), we showed 
that 16.9% of participants with definite streptococcal 
infective endocarditis had undergone dental procedures 
during the preceding three months.9
Although the case crossover analysis revealed a sta-
tistically significant association between invasive dental 
procedures and oral streptococcal infective endocarditis 
among participants with prosthetic heart valves, there 
is no good evidence to support a different effect between 
invasive and non-invasive dental procedures probably 
as a result of lack of power (P=0.07). We failed to show 
the efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis, again possibly ow-
ing to the lack of power attributable to the small number 
of participants in the different subgroups included in 
the antibiotic prophylaxis dental procedures model, in 
which only discordant pairs contributed.
Limitations of this study
Both the cohort and the case crossover study present 
several limitations. Firstly, they are subject to the 
limitations related to the use of administrative 
databases, which may include inaccurate coding of 
the participant’s clinical diagnosis and procedures, 
with clinical information limited to conditions and 
treatments defined by ICD-10 codes. Secondly, 
identification of the causal microorganism was also 
subject to limitations, as no specific ICD-10 codes are 
available to identify oral streptococci, and the diagnosis 
of infective endocarditis was not confirmed by using 
modified Duke criteria. However, ICD-10 codes were 
validated by referring to clinical records in selected 
participants, which showed high positive predictive 
values for the codes used. Finally, no information is 
available on adherence to antibiotic treatment after 
dispensing by the pharmacy.
Conclusion
Results of our two studies differed in terms of the statis-
tical significance for the association between invasive 
dental procedures and oral streptococcal infective endo-
carditis. However, both indicated the same direction of 
effect, suggesting that invasive dental procedures may 
be associated with oral streptococcal infective endocar-
ditis, although the magnitude of this association remains 
uncertain. Further studies based on an even larger scale, 
requiring international collaborations are needed to pro-
vide a sufficient statistical power to confirm these results 
and to evaluate the role of antibiotic prophylaxis, pend-
ing the initiation of a randomised clinical trial.39
