BACKGROUND: Cigarettes have been strongly associated with subsequent marijuana use among 
adolescents, but electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are now rapidly replacing traditional 
cigarettes among youth. This study examines associations between youth e-cigarette use 
and subsequent marijuana use in a national sample.
METHODS: Youth (aged 12–17 years) never marijuana users at wave 1 (n = 10 364; 2013–2014) 
from the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health study were followed-up in 1 year 
(wave 2, 2014–2015). Multivariable logistic regressions were performed to evaluate 
associations between e-cigarette use at wave 1 and ever/heavy marijuana use in the past 
12 months (P12M) and at wave 2.
RESULTS: Among never marijuana users, e-cigarette ever use (versus never use) at wave 1 was 
associated with increased likelihood of marijuana P12M use (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.9;  
95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.4–2.5) at wave 2. There was a significant interaction 
between e-cigarette use and age (P < .05) with aOR = 2.7 (95% CI: 1.7–4.3) for adolescents 
aged 12 to 14 and aOR = 1.6 (95% CI: 1.2–2.3) for adolescents aged 15 to 17. The association 
with heavy marijuana use was significant among younger adolescents (aOR = 2.5; 95%  
CI: 1.2–5.3) but was not among older adolescents. Heavier e-cigarette use at wave 1 yielded 
higher odds of P12M and heavy marijuana use at wave 2 for younger adolescents.
CONCLUSIONS: E-cigarette use predicts subsequent marijuana use among youth, with a 
stronger associations among young adolescents. Reducing youth access to e-cigarettes may 
decrease downstream marijuana use.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Cigarettes 
have been strongly associated with subsequent 
marijuana use among adolescents, but electronic 
cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are now rapidly replacing 
traditional cigarettes among youth. A growing body 
of literature shows that e-cigarettes could increase 
the subsequent risk of cigarette smoking among 
youth.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Youth e-cigarette use 
was associated with subsequent marijuana use, 
especially among young adolescents aged 12 to 14 
years. Policies influencing the exposure of youth 
to e-cigarettes may have downstream effects on 
uptake of marijuana.

 Although the prevalence of current 
cigarette smoking among youth 
declined from 28% in 1996 to 8% 
in 2016, 
1, 
 
2 electronic cigarette 
(e-cigarette) use is gaining 
popularity.3 Among teenagers, the 
use of e-cigarettes has outpaced 
the use of traditional cigarettes, 
especially among young adolescents.1, 
4  
It is also indicated in studies that 
marijuana remains the substance 
with the highest prevalence of use 
among youth; current use among 
high school seniors is nearly double 
that of current cigarette use.4 
Moreover, teenagers’ attitudes are 
moving toward greater acceptance 
of marijuana. For instance, the 
percentage of high school seniors 
who perceived the occasional use of 
marijuana as harmful dropped from 
27.4% in 2009 to 17.1% in 2016.4
In a growing body of longitudinal 
studies, it has been shown that youth 
who use e-cigarettes have higher 
odds of smoking cigarettes later, 
5 
–9 
suggesting that e-cigarettes might 
increase the risk of future cigarette 
use among adolescents. Researchers 
have also systematically evaluated 
cigarette smoking and marijuana 
use among adolescents. Authors 
of most longitudinal studies that 
examined cigarette smoking before 
marijuana use generally supported 
the association between baseline 
cigarette use and progression to 
use of other addictive substances 
(eg, marijuana).10 
– 
12 Although 
e-cigarettes are marketed as less 
harmful alternatives to smoking, 
13 
most youth are not using e-cigarettes 
to quit smoking. Instead, youth 
are attracted by the novelty of 
e-cigarettes and a wide variety 
of flavors specifically designed to 
appeal to the youth market.14 If 
youth e-cigarette use follows the 
same pattern as cigarette smoking, 
widespread use could expose 
youth to social environments that 
encourage substance use, thereby 
accelerating youths’ transitions to 
the use of other substances with 
more adverse health effects.15, 
 
16
Researchers in a few cross-sectional 
studies also examined the drug 
use patterns among adolescents, 
including poly use of e-cigarettes, 
marijuana, and other substances.17, 
 
18  
These studies revealed complex 
drug use patterns, and researchers 
identified higher risks of poly-drug 
use among e-cigarette users (versus 
nonusers).17, 
 
18 Authors of cross-
sectional studies have identified 
a high prevalence of marijuana 
vaping in both youth and adult 
populations.19 
– 
21 Researchers in 
a longitudinal study of Hispanic 
young adults further reported 
that e-cigarette use increased the 
likelihood of transitioning from 
nonusers to users of cigarettes or 
marijuana over a 1-year period.15 
However, studies are needed to 
evaluate the longitudinal associations 
of e-cigarette use and future 
marijuana use among adolescents in 
population-based samples.
Youth undergo multiple stages of 
development, and thus the role of 
e-cigarette use in an individual’s drug 
use patterns may differ by age.17 The 
age of e-cigarette initiation is similar 
to that of alcohol and marijuana, with 
a rapid increase after age 14 years 
and peaking around age 17 to 18 
years.22 Because younger e-cigarette 
users were more likely to be 
nonusers of traditional drugs, 
17 and 
adolescents who initiate substance 
use at an earlier age have higher 
risks for addiction and adverse 
health outcomes, 
23, 
24 we hypothesize 
that there might be an interaction 
between e-cigarette use and age 
in association with subsequent 
marijuana use. The risk difference in 
association between e-cigarette use 
and subsequent marijuana transition 
by age group has not been assessed 
in published studies.
To address these gaps, we analyzed 
the Population Assessment of 
Tobacco and Health (PATH) survey 
to examine the associations of 
e-cigarette use (ever or number of  
e-cigarettes and/or cartridges used) 
at baseline (wave 1) and subsequent 
marijuana use (past 12 months 
[P12M] or heavy use) 1 year later 
(wave 2). We further stratified the 
analyses by age groups (12–14  
and 15–17 years old) to enhance 
our understanding of this potential 
relationship.
METHODS
Data
Data on e-cigarette and marijuana 
use were obtained from wave 1 
and wave 2 of the PATH study, 
a longitudinal cohort study of 
tobacco use behaviors, attitudes, 
and beliefs among a nationally 
representative sample of US civilian, 
noninstitutionalized individuals 
aged 12 years and older.25 A 4-stage, 
stratified probability sample design 
was used in the PATH study, and 
further details regarding the data 
collection, study design, and methods 
can be found elsewhere.25, 
 
26 In this 
study, we used the public-use files 
of young participants aged 12 to 17 
years at wave 1, continuing young 
participants (those still aged <18 
years), and those who had become 
adults (age ≥18 years; “aged-up 
adults”) at wave 2.
Wave 1 of the PATH study was 
collected from September 2013 to 
December 2014 with 13 651 youth 
and 32 320 adults. Wave 2 of PATH 
was collected from October 2014 to 
October 2015 with 12 172 youth and 
28 362 adults. The weighted response 
rate for the wave 1 household 
screener was 54.0%. Among screened 
households, the overall weighted 
response rate for the wave 1 youth 
interview was 78.4%. The weighted 
retention rate for continuing youth at 
wave 2 was 88.4%, and the weighted 
recruitment rate for aged-up adults 
was 85.7%.25, 
 
26 Because the PATH 
research team provides publicly 
available deidentified data, this study 
was determined to be nonhuman

Measures
E-cigarette Use at Wave 1
All participants were shown a 
brief description and pictures 
of e-cigarettes followed by a 
question, “Have you seen or heard 
of e-cigarettes before this study?” 
Those who responded positively 
were asked, “Have you ever used 
an e-cigarette, even 1 or 2 times?” 
Those who responded “Yes” were 
categorized as e-cigarette ever users 
at wave 1. For the dose-response 
analysis, the number of e-cigarettes 
and/or cartridges used in an entire 
life was measured by an ordinal 
variable ranging from 0 (no use) to  
7 (100 or more).27 See Fig 1.
Marijuana Use at Wave 1 and Wave 2
Ever use of marijuana at wave 1 
was defined by 2 items from the 
PATH study: “Have you ever used 
marijuana, hash, THC, grass, pot, or 
weed?” and “Have you ever smoked 
part of all of a cigar, cigarillo, or 
filter cigar with marijuana in it?” 
Those who responded “No” to both 
of these questions were categorized 
as marijuana never users at wave 1. 
Those who responded “Yes” to either 
of these questions were categorized 
as marijuana ever users at wave 1.
At wave 2, marijuana never users 
at wave 1 who reported using 
marijuana in the P12M were 
categorized as marijuana P12M 
users. On the basis of an additional 
item, “Which substances did you use 
weekly or more often?” we further 
categorized those who responded 
“marijuana, hash, THC, grass, pot, or 
weed” as marijuana heavy users at 
wave 2.
Other Substance Use at Wave 1
Cigarette ever users were defined  
by the following item: “Have you  
ever tried cigarette smoking, even  
1 or 2 puffs?” Those who responded 
“Yes” were categorized as cigarette 
ever users. Alcohol ever users were 
participants who responded “Yes” 
to the following item: “Have you 
ever used alcohol at all, including 
sips of someone’s drink or your 
own drink?” Those who reported 
ever misuse of prescription drugs 
(ie, Ritalin, Adderall, painkillers, 
sedatives, or tranquilizers) were 
categorized as nonmedical ever users 
of prescription drugs. Those who 
reported ever using cocaine or crack, 
stimulants like methamphetamine 
or speed, heroin, inhalants, solvents, 
or hallucinogens were categorized as 
other illicit drug ever users.
Sensation Seeking
Sensation seeking was assessed 
by 3 items modified from the 
Brief Sensation Seeking Scale.28 
Participants were asked to indicate 
the extent of agreement on the 
5-point scale to the following: “I like 
new and exciting experiences, even if 
I have to break the rules”;  
“I like to do frightening things”; and 
“I prefer friends who are exciting 
and unpredictable.” Sensation 
seeking was calculated as the 
average response to these 3 items 
(Cronbach’s α = 0.76).28
Covariates
Several covariates were included to 
control for potential confounding 
effects: age (12–14 or 15–17 years 
old), sex (male or female), race 
and/or ethnicity (non-Hispanic 
[NH] white, NH African American, 
Hispanic, or NH other), grade 
performance (“mostly A’s” was 
classified as “A, 
” “A’s and B’s or 
mostly B’s” was classified as “B, 
” and 
“B’s and C’s or mostly C’s or below” 
was classified as “C or below”), 
parental education (less than high 
school, high school graduate, some 
college, or bachelor’s degree or 
greater), and region (Northeast, 
South, Midwest, West).

 Statistical Methods
Weighted estimates of demographic 
characteristics and substance use 
at wave 1 were calculated for the 
overall sample and stratified by 
e-cigarette ever use status. Balanced 
repeated replication method with 
Fay’s adjustment = 0.3 was used 
to increase stability in variance 
estimation.29, 
 
30 Confidence intervals 
(CIs) at the 95% level were calculated 
by using Wilson’s method. For 
continuing youth, wave 2 sampling 
weights in youth data were used; 
for aged-up adults, wave 2 sampling 
weights in adult data were used.27 
Separate multivariable logistic 
regressions were used to examine the 
associations of e-cigarette use (ever, 
number of e-cigarettes/cartridges 
used) at wave 1 on subsequent 
marijuana use (P12M or heavy use) 
at wave 2 among marijuana never 
users at wave 1. Stratified analyses 
were conducted by age group (12–14 
and 15–17 years old at wave 1). 
Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) were 
calculated in the multivariable 
analysis, in which all risk factors and 
covariates were included. Statistical 
analyses were performed by using 
SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC), 
and P values <.05 were considered 
statistically significant.
RESULTS
Study Sample
A total of 11 996 young participants 
aged 12 to 17 years completed both 
the wave 1 and wave 2 surveys. Ever 
users of marijuana (n = 1605; 13.4%) 
and subjects with missing marijuana 
ever use status (n = 27) at wave 1 
were excluded. The final analysis 
included 10 364 never marijuana 
users at wave 1 (Fig 1). As compared 
with ever marijuana users, never 
marijuana users tend to be younger 
and less likely to report using 
cigarettes, e-cigarettes, and other 
substances (Supplemental Table 5).
Sample Characteristics and 
Prevalence of Substance Use at 
Wave 1
Overall, 44.4% of never marijuana 
users were aged 15 to 17 years, and 
48.8% were female. NH white users 
accounted for 55.1% of respondents, 
followed by Hispanic users (21.7%), 
NH African American users (13.9%), 
and NH other users (9.4%) (Table 1).  
In terms of substance use, 5.1% of 
adolescents reported ever use of 
e-cigarettes, 6.0% reported ever 
smoking cigarettes, 31.0% reported 
ever drinking alcohol, 7.3% reported 
ever nonmedical use of prescription 
drugs, and 0.2% reported ever use of 
other illicit drugs.
Significant differences between 
e-cigarette never and ever users 
were observed. E-cigarette ever users 
were more likely than e-cigarette 
never users to be older, male, white, 
and have poorer grade performance. 
They were also more likely to 
report sensation seeking, smoking 
cigarettes, drinking, and ever 
nonmedical use of prescription drugs 
and using other illicit drugs.
Temporal Association With 
Marijuana P12M and Heavy Use at 
Wave 2
Overall, 8.7% of never marijuana 
users at wave 1 reported use of 
marijuana at wave 2. More than  
1 in 4 (26.6%) adolescents who ever  
used e-cigarettes at wave 1 reported 
subsequent marijuana use at wave 2,  
as compared with 7.7% of adolescents 
who never used e-cigarettes at  
wave 1 (P < .05) (Table 2).  
After adjusting for demographic 
factors and other substance use, 
e-cigarette ever users at wave 1 were 
more likely to report subsequent 
P12M marijuana use at wave 2 (aOR =  
1.9; CI: 1.4–2.5). Older age, being 
female, being African American, and 
having lower grade performance all 
had significantly elevated adjusted 
odds for wave 2 marijuana P12M use. 
In addition, wave 1 sensation seeking 
and cigarette and alcohol ever use 
had significantly elevated odds for 
wave 2 marijuana use.
Overall, 2.8% of marijuana never 
users at wave 1 reported heavy 
use of marijuana at wave 2. 
Female participants (versus male 
participants) and adolescents 
with a grade performance of “C or 
below” (versus those with “A”) were 
more likely to report heavy use 
of marijuana at wave 2. Sensation 
seeking, cigarette ever use, and 
alcohol ever use at wave 1 were 
associated with higher odds of 
reporting heavy use of marijuana  
at wave 2.
Age-Stratified Analysis of the 
Temporal Association Between 
E-cigarette Use and Subsequent 
Marijuana Use
There were significant interactions 
between age group (12–14 years 
and 15–17 years) and marijuana 
P12M (P < .05) and heavy (P < .05) 
use (Table 3, Supplemental Fig 2). 
The association between baseline 
e-cigarette use and P12M marijuana 
use at wave 2 was significant among 
both younger adolescents aged 12 to 
14 years (29.2% vs 5.5%; aOR = 2.7; 
CI: 1.7–4.3) and older adolescents 
aged 15 to 17 years (25.3% vs 10.6%; 
aOR = 1.6; CI: 1.2–2.3). Moreover, 
the association between baseline 
e-cigarette use and subsequent heavy 
marijuana use was significant among 
young adolescents (12.0% vs 1.9%; 
aOR = 2.5; CI: 1.2–5.3) but was not 
significant among older adolescents.
We tested a dose-response 
relationship between the amount of 
e-cigarettes used and subsequent 
marijuana use in Table 4. Reporting 
a larger number of e-cigarettes/
cartridges used in a lifetime at  
wave 1 was associated with higher  
odds of P12M (aOR = 1.7;  
CI: 1.3–2.0) and heavy (aOR = 1.6;  
CI: 1.2–2.2) marijuana use for 
younger adolescents.

 DISCUSSION
It is suggested in the results from 
this longitudinal study that baseline 
e-cigarette use independently 
predicts subsequent marijuana use 
among youth after controlling for 
social-demographic factors, sensation 
seeking, and other substance use. 
The overall prevalence of ever 
e-cigarette use among adolescents 
was 10.6% in the PATH 2013–2014 
study (Supplemental Table 5), 
which is aligned with the prevalence 
reported by the National Youth 
Tobacco Survey (8.1% in 2013).3 At 
wave 1, never marijuana users had 
a significantly lower prevalence of 
e-cigarette ever use as compared 
with marijuana users (5.1% vs 
46.4%). To avoid confounding effects, 
baseline marijuana users were

 excluded from analysis, which led 
to a low prevalence of e-cigarette 
use at baseline in this study. For 
associations between e-cigarette and 
subsequent marijuana use, the aORs 
were lower than the crude ratios.  
As shown in Supplemental Table 6,  
the reduction was most affected 
by ever use of cigarettes, followed 
by drinking alcohol and sensation 
seeking, and slightly affected by 
age and grade performance. There 
are several possible reasons why 
e-cigarette use might be associated 
with subsequent marijuana initiation. 
On the one hand, e-cigarettes may 
simply be a marker of risk-taking 
behavior; e-cigarette users are 
more likely to smoke cigarettes 
and drink alcohol, which are also 
associated with marijuana use.31,

 Alternatively, because the brain is 
still developing during the teenage 
years, nicotine exposure might lead 
to changes in the central nervous 
system that predispose teenagers 
to dependence on other drugs 
of abuse.33 Experimenting with 
e-cigarettes might also increase a 
youth’s curiosity about marijuana, 
reduce perceived harm of marijuana 
use, and increase the social access to 
marijuana from peers and friends. 
As a result of marketing and social 
media promotion, 
34, 
 
35 vaping 
cannabis is gaining popularity.19, 
 
20  
Youth who experiment with 
e-cigarettes may use the same device 
or switch to newer generation 
devices for vaping marijuana, 
20, 
36 
which could lead to use of substance 
with stronger addictive effects.37
With these findings, we highlight the 
importance of policy and education 
to reduce risks for youth. Currently, 
e-cigarette and marijuana are the 2 
most commonly used substances by 
teenagers. The FDA has extended its 
authority to regulate e-cigarettes, 
and the first round of these new 
regulations, including mandatory 
age and photo identification checks 
to prevent illegal sales of newly 
regulated tobacco products to 
minors, went into effect on August 8, 
201638 (after data collected for this 
study). Data from this study may have 
implications for state authorities 
that presently vary greatly in their 
enforcement of e-cigarette sales and 
legal access to marijuana.39 
– 
41 It is 
important for health providers and 
educators to advise youth about the 
risks of e-cigarette use, including 
the propensity of progression to 
marijuana use after e-cigarette use. 
Policies to prevent youth use of 
e-cigarettes and reduce youth access 
to e-cigarettes, such as expanding 
smoke-free policies and Tobacco  
21 policies, should be considered  
as well.
In research on the developmental 
trajectory of substance use and 
addiction, the critical role of nicotine 
initiation at an early age has been 
highlighted. For instance, smoking at 
a young age increases the likelihood 
of becoming an addicted daily 
smoker.2,

 of e-cigarette use on subsequent 
marijuana use by age group. The 
temporal association between 
baseline e-cigarette use and initiation 
of marijuana use was larger among 
younger adolescents aged 12 to 14 
years than among older adolescents 
aged 15 to 17 years. This finding 
is consistent with previous cross-
sectional studies in which it was 
indicated that younger high school 
students were more likely to use 
e-cigarettes to vape cannabis, and 
that e-cigarettes may have made 
inroads among younger users who 
have low risks of using traditional 
substances.17, 
 
20 As youth start to 
initiate e-cigarettes as early as 7 
years old, 
44 the interaction between 
age and subsequent marijuana 
use underscores the importance 
of starting prevention efforts on 
e-cigarette and other substance use 
at an earlier age because these youth 
have the most to gain. In addition, 
we found that youth who reported a 
larger number of e-cigarettes and/or  
cartridges used in a lifetime at 
baseline were more likely to be 
subsequent marijuana heavy users. 
Because the regular use of marijuana 
during adolescence is of particular 
concern for adverse health effects, 
45 
we add to the existing literature by 
identifying the quantity of e-cigarette 
use as a risk factor for marijuana 
heavy use.
This study is subject to several 
limitations. First, both e-cigarette and 
marijuana use were self-reported. 
Thus, reporting and recall biases 
might have occurred, especially for 
younger respondents.46 Second, not 
all youth included in wave 1 of the 
PATH study responded to the wave 2 
survey. However, attrition was not 
associated with a previous history of 
substance use (Supplemental Table 5). 
Finally, the investigators of the  
PATH study did not ask respondents 
about what substances youth vaped 
in their e-cigarettes, which could 
include flavoring only, nicotine, or 
marijuana derivatives.47 Therefore, 
we were not able to ascertain which 
specific vaped substances had effects 
on subsequent marijuana use.
Future studies are needed to 
investigate the underlying 
mechanism of substance transition 
and evaluate long-term impacts of 
e-cigarette use. Our study revealed 
that e-cigarette use was associated 
with an increased risk of subsequent 
marijuana use among youth, with 
a stronger temporal association 
among younger adolescents. With 
these findings, we suggest that 
the widespread use of e-cigarettes 
among youth may have implications 
for the uptake of other drugs of 
abuse beyond nicotine and tobacco 
products.
