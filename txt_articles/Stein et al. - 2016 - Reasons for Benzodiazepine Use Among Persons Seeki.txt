Abstract
 Background—Over the past decade, patients admitted to addiction treatment programs have 
reported increasing rates of concurrent opioid and benzodiazepine (BZD) use. This drug 
combination places individuals at high risk for accidental overdose. Little is known about reasons 
for BZD use among individuals seeking treatment for opioid use disorders.
 Methods—We surveyed consecutive persons initiating inpatient opioid detoxification and 
identified 176 out of 438 who reported BZD use in the past 30 days and/or had a positive 
toxicology.
 Results—Forty percent of persons surveyed used a BZD in the month prior to admission, and 
25% of these met criteria for BZD dependence (DSM IV). BZD users averaged 32.0 years of age, 
63.6% were male, 85.2% used heroin, and reported, on average, 13.3 (± 11.2) days of BZD use 
during the past month. Alprazolam (Xanax) was the most commonly used BZD (52%), and buying 
it on the street the most common source (48%). The most commonly reported reason for BZD use 
was ‘to manage anxiety’ (42.6%), followed by ‘to get or enhance a high’ (27.7%), ‘to help with 
sleep’ (11.4%), and ‘to decrease opioid withdrawal’ (10.2%). The most common reason for BZD 
use was significantly associated (p < .001) with most likely source of BZDs, with persons who got 
their BZDs from a prescriber (23%) more likely to report BZD anxiety as their primary reason for 
use, while persons who bought BZDs on “the street” (48%) had the highest likelihood of reporting 
using BZD to get or enhance a high. Participants using BZDs most commonly for anxiety did not 
endorse lower anxiety than those using BZDs for other reasons.
 Conclusions—Two in five persons seeking detoxification for an opioid use disorder used a 
BZD in the prior month. Anxiety was the most common reason patients reported using a

withdrawal. Evidence-based discussions about the risks of combining BZDs and opioids, and 
alternatives to BZDs should be a high priority in detoxification settings.

 1.0 INTRODUCTION
Use of benzodiazepines (BZDs) is prevalent in patients with opioid use disorders (Bleich, et 
al., 1999; Brands, et al., 2008; Lavie, Fatseas, Denis, & Auriacombe, 2009), but there has 
been a dramatic increase in concurrent use in the recent past. Patients admitted to addiction 
treatment programs reporting combined use of opioids and BZDs increased 570% between 
2000 and 2010 (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration Center for 
Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, 2012). Concurrent use of benzodiazepines in 
persons receiving opioid replacement therapy such as buprenorphine or methadone can be as 
high as 70% (Nielsen, Dietze, Lee, Dunlop, & Taylor, 2007).
Serious health problems may arise for people using opioids and BZDs in combination. 
BZDs’ sedative actions target the GABAA receptor and adverse effects depend on the 
presence of impaired hepatic function, and complex drug-drug interactions (via CYP system 
metabolism), which can produce increased opioid serum concentrations (Jann, Kennedy, & 
Lopez, 2014). Concurrent use of both can slow heart rate and breathing, and increases the 
risk of accidental overdose (Gudin, Mogali, Jones, & Comer, 2013; Jones, Mogali, & 
Comer, 2012; Park, Saitz, Ganoczy, Ilgen, & Bohnert, 2015). According to the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), opioid overdose related deaths nearly quadrupled 
between the years 1999 to 2011 (Volkow, Frieden, Hyde, & Cha, 2014); an estimated 31% of 
opioid related deaths were associated with concurrent BZD use (Chen, Hedegaard, & 
Warner, 2014). Among veterans prescribed opioids, BZD use is associated with greater 
mortality in a dose-dependent fashion (Park, et al., 2015).
Few studies to date have explored the reasons why persons with opioid use disorders use 
benzodiazepines. Several studies have found that patients receiving chronic opioid agonist 
treatment (OAT) often use BZDs to help with anxiety and sleep (Gelkopf, Bleich, Hayward, 
Bodner, & Adelson, 1999; Posternak & Mueller, 2001; Vogel, et al., 2013). Other work in 
OAT populations has suggested patients in methadone maintenance treatment take BZDs to 
get high (Chen, et al., 2011; Fatseas, Lavie, Denis, & Auriacombe, 2009; Gelkopf, et al., 
1999; Iguchi, Handelsman, Bickel, & Griffiths, 1993). Fewer studies exploring reasons for 
use have focused on treatment-seeking opioid users. Inciardi et al reported that individuals 
using BZDs non-medically, may use BZDs to decrease the discomfort of withdrawal in 
situations when opioids are unavailable, as BZDs may be easier or less expensive to obtain 
than opioids in certain regions (Inciardi, Surratt, Cicero, & Beard, 2009).
Short-term inpatient medical detoxification is a common initial site of care for treatment-
seeking persons with opioid use disorders (Bailey, Herman, & Stein, 2013; Carrier, et al., 
2011; Mark, Dilonardo, Chalk, & Coffey, 2002; Stein, Anderson, Thurmond, & Bailey, 
Stein et al.

 2015; Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2004), and offers a 
window on BZD use among opioid users in the community prior to seeking care. The 
purposes of this study were 1) to report the prevalence of BZD use among patients seeking 
treatment for an opioid use disorder, 2) to explore the most common reasons for and sources 
of BZDs in this population, and 3) to determine if these reasons were associated with BZD 
use severity or measures of anxiety and depression.
 2.0 METHODS
 2.1 Recruitment
Between September 2014 and May 2015, persons seeking opioid detoxification were 
approached within the first 24 hours of admission to Stanley Street Treatment Addiction and 
Recovery, Inc. (SSTAR) in Fall River, Massachusetts to participate in a survey research 
study. SSTAR’s program, one of the largest in Southeastern New England, has 38 beds and 
is a 24-hour medically supervised treatment facility that provides evaluation and withdrawal 
management with a mean length-of-stay of 4.9 days using a methadone protocol (as well as 
individual and group counseling and case management).
Of patients admitted to SSTAR during the recruitment period, 452 were opioid users who 
were 18 years or older, English-speaking, and able to provide verbal informed consent as 
approved by the Butler Hospital Institutional Review Board. Fourteen refused study 
participation or were discharged before staff could interview them. The remaining 438 
persons completed a face-to-face interview and were not incentivized. All surveys were 
administered by non-treating research staff and required approximately 15 minutes. Persons 
were defined as BZD users if they responded to the question, “How many days in the last 30 
have you used benzos (for instance, Ativan, Klonopin, Librium, Xanax, Valium)?” by 
reporting at least one day of use, or if they were positive for BZD on urine toxicological 
testing at entry to detoxification. This left a final sample of 176 for the current analysis.
 2.2 Measures
Sample descriptors included age, gender, race/ethnicity, employment (part- or full-time vs. 
unemployed), and years of education. Regarding previous opioid treatment, we asked if 
participants had ever been in opioid detoxification in the past, or had ever received 
methadone or been prescribed buprenorphine. Participants were classified as recent cocaine 
users if they reported any use during the past 30 days. Participants also reported frequency 
and usual quantity of alcohol use during the past 30 days; hazardous drinking was defined as 
> 7 drinks / week for females or > 14 drinks / week for males (National Institute on Alcohol 
Abuse and Alcoholism, 2005). Participants were asked they were receiving professional 
treatment for depression or for anxiety, and if they were, what type they were receiving 
(counseling, medication, both counseling and medication). We asked “Which is the benzo 
you use most often?” Responses included Klonopin, Librium, Xanax, Valium, and ‘I don’t 
know.’ We also asked, “Where were you most likely to get the benzos that you used in the 
last 30 days?” Responses included: “bought them from someone else such as a dealer or on 
the street,” “bought or borrowed from a friend,” and “prescribed to you by a physician.” We 
asked participants: “Benzos can be used in lots of ways. Please indicate how often in the last

 month you have used benzos for the following reasons.” The list of reasons was derived 
from previous literature (Chen, et al., 2011; Fatseas, et al., 2009; Gelkopf, et al., 1999; 
Lintzeris & Nielsen, 2010) and included “To help you sleep,” “Because they make you 
high,” “To help manage your pain,” “To help manage your anxiety,” “To help manage your 
depression,” “To balance the effects of opiates,” “To balance the effects of alcohol,” “To 
balance the effects of cocaine,” “To help you drink less alcohol,” “To increase the high of 
opiates,” “To decrease the effects of opiate withdrawal,” or “Other reasons (please list).” The 
response options included 1 = never/almost never, 2=sometimes, 3=often, and 4 = always/
almost always. We then asked, “What is the most common reason that you use benzos?” 
Depressive and anxiety symptoms were measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire 
(PHQ)-4 (Lowe, et al., 2010). Scores potentially range from 0–6 on the PHQ-2 Depression 
and PHQ-2 Anxiety Indices; persons screening positive for depression or anxiety have 
scores of 3 or higher on each, respectively. BZD use severity was measured using the 
Severity of Dependence Scale (Gossop, et al., 1995). This 5-item scale (each with a potential 
range 0–3) had high internal consistency reliability (alpha = .89), and the mean index score 
was 3.95 (SD = 4.85). A score of ≥ 7 is considered the cut-off for dependence (Gossop, et 
al., 1995).
 2.3 Analytical Methods
We present descriptive statistics to summarize the characteristics of the sample. T-tests for 
differences in means and χ2-tests for differences in frequencies were used to compare males 
and females with respect to background characteristics, substance use behaviors, mood, and 
most common reason for BZD use. Because of non-normal distributions and small expected 
cell sizes, we used the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA on ranks and 
Fisher’s exact test to compare benzodiazepine dependence severity, anxiety and depression 
by most common reason for BZD use.
 3.0 RESULTS
Participants averaged 32.0 (± 8.8) years of age, 63.6% were male, 88.6% were non-Latino 
Caucasian, and mean educational attainment was 12.0 (± 1.8) years (Table 1). Eighty-two 
(46.6%) had seen a primary care physician in the past year, 68.8% reported a prior detox, 
and most (85.2%) were detoxing from heroin. On average they reported 13.3 (± 11.2) days 
of BZD use during the past month, the mean BZD severity dependence score was 3.8 
(± 4.7), and 44 (25.0%) met screening criteria for BZD dependence. Over two-thirds 
(71.6%) reported injection drug use, 45.5% reported cocaine use, 39.8% met NIAAA criteria 
for hazardous drinking, and 80.1% and 75.0% met screening criteria for depression and 
anxiety, respectively, on the PHQ-2. About 39.2% had a history of methadone maintenance 
treatment and 46.6% of buprenorphine treatment.
Alprazolam (52.3%), clonazepam (30.1%), and diazepam (10.8%) were the most commonly 
reported benzodiazepines (Table 1). Over half (48.3%) reported purchasing on the street, 
28.4% reported buying or borrowing from friends, and 23.3% said a prescription from a 
physician was their most likely source of BZDs. “To help manage anxiety” was the most 
frequently cited (42.6%) primary reason for BZD use; 24.4% stated they used BZDs to get

 or enhance a high, 11.4% said they used BZDs to help them sleep, and 10.2% said they used 
BZDs to help manage opioid withdrawal. Only 2.3% reported that managing depression was 
their primary reason for BZD use. Other cited reasons (9.1%) included managing pain and 
drinking less alcohol. Twenty-three persons (13.1%) reported taking a prescribed medication 
for depression or anxiety with 19 of these persons receiving medication for both anxiety and 
depression.
Neither mean benzodiazepine dependence severity scores (Kruskal-Wallis χ2 = 9.16, df = 5, 
p = .103) nor the percentage meeting criteria for benzodiazepine dependence (Fisher’s exact 
p = .228) varied significantly by most common reason for BZD use (Table 2), although 
persons who used to manage anxiety or depression tended to have the highest mean 
dependence severity score and likelihood of meeting dependence criteria. Days of BZD use 
was significantly correlated with the continuous measure of BZD dependence severity (r= .
58; p < .001) and associated with BZD dependence (p< .01). There was no significant 
difference between type of BZD most often used and the most common reason for use (p= .
52).
There was no significant statistical difference in the percentage screening positive for either 
anxiety (Fisher’s exact p = .418) or depression (Fisher’s exact p = .822) by most common 
reason for BZD use (Table 3). Additional analysis (not reported in Table 3) found that mean 
PHQ-4 scores did not vary significantly by most common reason for using BZDs (Kruskal-
Wallis χ2 = 4.40, df = 5, p = .493). Differences in mean PHQ-2 anxiety scores were very 
similar (3.98 vs 4.04) among daily and non-daily BZD users (t = −0.18, p = .856).
Most common reason for BZD use was associated significantly (Fisher’s exact p < .001) 
with most likely source of BZDs (Table 4). About 70.3% of persons who reported that a 
physician prescription was their most likely source of BZD said anxiety was their primary 
reason for use; an additional 4.9% cited depression. Managing anxiety was also relatively 
frequently cited by those who said they got BZDs from family or friends (36.0%) or who 
purchased BZDs on the street (32.9%). Persons who purchased BZDs on the street had the 
highest likelihood (34.1%) of saying their primary reason for BZD use was to get or enhance 
a high.
Meeting screening criteria for BZD dependence was associated significantly (χ2 = 8.40, df = 
2, p = .015) with most likely BZD source. Rates of a positive BZD dependence screen were 
31.7% among persons with physician prescribed BZDs, 30.6% among persons purchasing 
BZDs on the street, and 10.0% among those whose most likely source of BZDs was family 
or friends.
Participants reported using BZDs for multiple reasons (Table 5). Among persons who said 
that anxiety was the most common reason for BZD use, 45.3% said they sometimes or more 
often used BZDs to get or enhance a high, 77.3% said they sometimes used BZDs to help 
them sleep, 52.0% to help manage opioid withdrawal, 61.3% to help manage depression, and 
38.7% said they sometimes used BZDs for other reasons. Overall, only 24 (13.6%) persons 
reported they sometimes or more often used BZDs for only 1 reason, 22 (12.5%) endorsed 2 
reasons, 35 (19.9%) endorsed 3 reasons, 31 (17.6%) endorsed 4 reasons, 33 (18.8%)

 endorsed 5 reasons, and 31 (17.6%) said they sometimes or more often used BZDs for all 6 
reasons.
 4.0 DISCUSSION
In this sample of 438 persons with opioid use disorders seeking opioid detoxification, 176 
(40%) used BZDs in the month prior to entering the detoxification program. This finding is 
noteworthy, because it is one of only a few studies that illustrates the prevalence of BZD use 
among treatment-seeking opioid-addicted individuals, many of whom are using heroin 
(85%) and injecting drugs (72%). We found that the mostly commonly used BZD was 
alprazolam (Xanax) (52%), followed by clonazepam (Klonopin) (30%), followed by 
diazepam (Valium) (11%). Alprazolam is commonly preferred among addicted persons due 
to its quick onset of action and subjective high (Lader, 2011). Clonazepam, with its slower 
onset of action and long duration, may be preferred for insomnia or opioid withdrawal.
Members of this already high-risk population are compounding their risk of overdose with 
concurrent use of benzodiazepines. Most public health campaigns highlighting the risk of 
overdose due to combining opioids and BZDS are directed at prescribers. Only 23% of our 
sample got their BZDs from a prescriber, lower than that reported in populations of opioid 
users in drug treatment (Chen, et al., 2011; Jann, et al., 2014). The majority got BZDs from 
“the street” (48%) or a friend or family member (28%). Prescribers continue to need 
education on the risks of combining opioids and benzodiazepines, but another important 
target audience is drug users themselves, who prior to seeking treatment may never cross 
paths with a health care provider in their pursuit and self-administration of opioids and 
BZDs and therefore may be missing out on the diagnosis of psychiatric symptoms and 
alternative treatments for anxiety or depression. Self-medication and peer-medication are 
critical issues to discuss during detoxification.
Most participants in our sample reported using BZDs for multiple reasons. The most 
common reason was to help manage anxiety (43%). The second most common reason was to 
get or enhance a high (28%). More than 45% of participant who reported using BZDs to 
manage anxiety, were also using BZDs to get high.
We detected an interesting relationship between reasons for BZD use and the primary source 
of BZDs. Nearly three in four persons who reported they use prescribed BZDs also reported 
anxiety as their primary reason for using BZDs. By contrast, only 3% of persons reporting 
using BZDs to get high got their BZDs from a prescription – the rest procured them from 
non-prescription sources (friends, family, the street). These data remind us that the source of 
a prescription medication plays an important role in a person’s self-narrative around why 
they are using that medication, which is why it is essential for clinicians to help patients who 
have become addicted to prescribed BZDs to unwind the anxiety-treatment narrative if it no 
longer applies. The proportion of persons fulfilling criteria for dependence on the Severity 
Dependence Scale (25%) is comparable here to that found in other opioid-using populations 
(Lavie, et al., 2009; Ross & Darke, 2000; Seivewright & Iqbal, 2002).

 Participants using BZDs primarily for anxiety did not, of note, endorse lower overall anxiety 
than those using benzodiazepines for other reasons. As a group, our cohort of BZD users had 
much higher rates of anxiety than other reported samples of persons with opioid use 
disorders on OAT (Mark, Dilonardo, Vandivort, & Miller, 2013; Milby, et al., 1996; Rooney, 
Kelly, Bamford, Sloan, & O’Connor, 1999; Ross & Darke, 2000). One possible explanation 
for these findings is that BZDs used for anxiety in the context of an active, untreated opioid 
use disorder, are ineffective for that purpose, even when patients subjectively report anxiety-
relief with their use. This would be consistent with the literature showing that psychiatric 
symptoms tend to get worse in the face of ongoing addictive substance use, even with 
concurrent psychotropic medications to treat that disorder (Brienza, et al., 2000). Another 
possible explanation is social desirability bias; participants who believe they need BZDs to 
treat anxiety, may endorse high level of anxiety to justify BZD use. An additional possibility 
is that most persons using BZD to manage anxiety were not procuring BZD from physicians 
and may be insufficiently treated, although we cannot deduce the effectiveness of BZDs for 
anxiety in this cross-sectional study. It is unknown whether the rates of anxiety would be 
higher or lower without BZDs. Finally, some patients may be experiencing anxiety as an 
effect of acute nicotine or alcohol withdrawal, or even opioid withdrawal, despite the site’s 
pharmacological management of these.
Our study had limitations. First, we relied on self-report of treatment histories. Second, 
recruitment was limited to individuals seeking inpatient opioid detoxification. Third, we 
recruited participants from only one location and our sample was primarily non-Latino 
Caucasian and male. Fourth, we did not inquire about the dose of BZD used, route of 
administration, or use patterns; future studies should examine these variables. Fifth, while it 
is likely that participants used more than one type of BZD, and indeed may have used 
different BZDs for different reasons, we were not able to perform this analysis. Qualitative 
research could shed light on this issue. Finally, we do not have clinical assessment of 
psychiatric disorders that may be associated with BZD use in this population, such as PTSD 
or borderline personality disorder, nor do we have clinical diagnoses of anxiety or 
depression.
 5.0 CONCLUSIONS
This study offers additional information for clinicians and policy-makers to address the 
opioid use and opioid overdose epidemic, particularly as pertains to concurrent use of BZDs. 
Clinicians need to be aware that some persons with opioid use disorders use BZDs to get or 
augment the opioid high, in addition to using BZDs for symptoms such as anxiety, sleep, 
opioid withdrawal, and depression. Clinicians should educate their patients that although in 
the short term they may experience subjective relief of anxiety with BZDs, long-term use is 
likely to have limited effectiveness. Education on the risks, benefits and alternatives of BZDs 
need to be directed not just to clinicians, but also to opioid-addicted BZD users, many of 
whom who are more likely to be getting the BZD from a non-clinical source, and thus will 
not have the opportunity to gain knowledge of BZD risks from health care providers. The 
best option to manage anxiety and other symptoms commonly treated with BZDs remains 
unknown in this population. Whether the benefits of prescribing BZDs in the context of 
maintenance OAT outweigh the risks remains a debated issue. Either way, there is likely to

 be a fine line between therapeutic use and misuse, and the risk of developing a BZD use 
disorder may be high (Center for Substance Abuse Treatment, 2005; Seivewright & Iqbal, 
2002) although we are not aware of prospective studies evaluating this possibility.

 Highlights
•
Prior to entering detox, opioid users frequently used BZDs, most often 
alprazolam
•
“To help manage anxiety” was the most frequently cited primary reason 
for BZD use
•
Persons who bought BZDs on “the street” were most likely to report 
using BZD “to get or enhance a high.”
•
75.0% met screening criteria for anxiety despite BZD use
