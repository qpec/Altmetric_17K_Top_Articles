ABSTRACT
Background: Up to half of people with dementia in high income countries live in nursing homes and more
than two-thirds of care home residents have dementia. Fewer than half of these residents report good quality
of life and most older people are anxious about the prospect of moving into a nursing home. Robust evidence
is needed as to the causes of admission to nursing homes, particularly where these risk factors are modifiable.
Methods: We conducted a systematic literature search to identify controlled comparison studies in which the
primary outcome was admission to nursing home of older adults with dementia. Identified studies were
assessed for validity and 26 (17 cohort and 9 case-control) were included. Qualitative and quantitative
analyses were conducted, including meta-analysis of 15 studies.
Results: Poorer cognition and behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) were consistently
associated with an increased risk of nursing home admission and most of our meta-analyses demonstrated
impairments in activities of daily living as a significant risk. The effects of community support services were
unclear, with both high and low levels of service use leading to nursing home placement. There was an
association between caregiver burden and risk of institutionalization, but findings with regard to caregiver
depression varied, as did physical health associations, with some studies showing an increased risk of nursing
home placement following hip fracture, reduced mobility, and multiple comorbidities.
Conclusion: We recommend focusing on cognitive enhancement strategies, assessment and management of
BPSD, and carer education and support to delay nursing home placement.
Key words: older adults, dementia, nursing home placement, risk factors
Introduction
In 2012, the World Health Organisation and
Alzheimer’s Disease International emphasized the
public health priority status of dementia (WHO,
2012). Recent estimates indicate that 44.4 million
people worldwide live with dementia, and this is set
to rise to 135.5 million by the year 2050 (Guerchet
et al., 2013).
For high income countries, the transition of
people with dementia into care homes is a relatively
common process; between 33% and 50% of people
with dementia in high income countries were

estimated to reside in a care home (Prince et al.,
2015). Care home populations are made up of
substantial numbers of people with dementia, for
example in the UK, it has been estimated that
up to 80% of care home residents have dementia
(Alzheimer’s Society, 2013). Unfortunately, fewer
than half of these residents reported having a good
quality of life. Abuse amongst older people in
care homes remains a serious problem and most
older people are anxious about being admitted to a
nursing home, primarily because of concerns about
the standard of care they will receive (Cooper et al.,
2008). People with dementia and their families
frequently experience great difficulties adjusting to
the new caring environment in nursing homes and
prefer to remain at home for as long as possible
(Sury et al., 2013).
In this context, it is helpful to identify factors
that facilitate people with dementia remaining at

home. This systematic review sought to understand
the key factors that influence the decision for people
with dementia to move into care homes, with
particular emphasis on those factors that might be
responsive to intervention.
Methods
Definition of nursing home
For the purposes of this study, we defined a
nursing home as any residential institution in which
permanent residents received round the clock care
from the staff of the home, which may or may not
have included qualified nursing staff. This reflects
the majority of our included studies, which used
this term in preference to the more generic “care
home,” which is employed in the UK.
Types of paper included in the review
Controlled comparison studies, including ran-
domized controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies,
epidemiological studies, case-control studies, sys-
tematic literature reviews, and descriptive studies
were eligible for inclusion in this review.
Types of risk factor
The following categories of risk factor for people
with dementia resulting in nursing home placement
were considered for inclusion in this review: cognit-
ive; behavioral/psychological; carer related; envir-
onmental; functional; and physical health related.
Types of comparison group
In this review, we identified either case-control
studies or cohort studies for inclusion. The majority
of the case-control studies presented their results as
mean and standard deviations or odds ratios. The
majority of cohort studies presented their findings
as risk ratios or hazard ratios. As a result, the find-
ings in this paper have been presented separately for
cohort studies and case-control studies.
Types of outcome measure
The primary outcomes in this review included the
following:
1. number of patients admitted to nursing homes;
2. total number of admissions to nursing homes;
3. time to nursing home placement.
Types of participant
The inclusion criteria for the participants in this
review were that the samples contained:
1. people aged 60 years or older; and
2. people with a dementia diagnosis of any type; or
3. carers of people with dementia.
The exclusion criterion was that none of the
participants had a dementia diagnosis or was a carer
for someone with dementia.
Search methods for the identification of
studies
Electronic searches
We searched the NHS electronic library records,
which contained records from the following major
healthcare databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Psy-
cINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science, and PubMed,
for the period 1999 to February 2015.
The following search terms were used for
the database searches: old, elder, aged, memory
problems, memory disorders, cognition, cognitive
disorders, dementia, Alzheimer’s, vascular, fron-
totemporal, predictors, causes, crisis, indicators,
risk profiles, risk factors, model, risk assessment,
clinical indicators, prediction, trends, forecasting,
probability, prevalence, emergency, hospital, psy-
chiatric, hospitalization, patient admission, patient
transfer, patient readmission, institutionalization,
admissions, nursing home, care home, long-term
care.
Searching other resources
We checked the reference lists of key papers and
relevant systematic reviews identified by the above
methods.
Data collection and analysis
Selection of studies
Titles and abstracts of citations obtained from
the search were examined independently by two
researchers and any obviously irrelevant articles
were discarded. The full text of those studies
deemed relevant was obtained. Where it was not
possible to accept or reject based on title and
abstract alone, the full text of the citation was
obtained for further evaluation.
Assessment of eligibility was undertaken from
the full text. Attempts were made to obtain
additional information from the study authors
where necessary. A third reviewer was consulted
in cases of doubt over whether or not inclusion
criteria were met. In addition, the third reviewer
independently reviewed the selected studies and
agreement was reached on which papers should be
included.
Assessment of validity
Studies meeting the inclusion criteria were assigned
a level of evidence according to the Newcastle–
Ottawa Scale (NOS) for assessing the quality of
non-randomized studies (case-control and cohort

studies) in meta-analyses (Wells et al., 2012). This
consists of a “star system” in which a study is
judged on three broad perspectives: the selection of
the study groups; the comparability of the groups;
and the ascertainment of either the exposure or
outcome of interest for case-control or cohort
studies respectively. Three reviewers assigned levels
of evidence to each study independently and, in
cases of disagreement, discussed the studies until a
conclusion was agreed. Studies assigned 7∗ or more
(maximum 9) were included in this review.
Results
Included studies
The PRISMA flowchart (Figure 1) depicts the
inclusion and exclusion of studies.
A

was
identified
through the literature search, of which 2,786 were
excluded by reference to title and abstract alone,
as they did not cover risk factors associated with
nursing home placement (NHP) for people with
dementia.
Of the remaining 198 papers, the full text
was obtained and 172 were excluded for the
following reasons: sample not appropriate; data
not relevant/useful to the review; cross-sectional
design only; systematic review; planned/desired
NHP rather than actual NHP; end point included
placements in a variety of settings, which could
not be differentiated; not translated into English;
did not assess risk factors for NHP; end point not
NHP; quality rating lower than 7∗ according to
the NOS. In light of these exclusions, 26 studies
were included in the present review; 17 cohort
studies (see Table 1) and 9 case-control studies (see
Table 2). Only 15 of these studies could feasibly be
included in the meta-analyses.
Cohort studies
The majority of cohort studies presented their
findings as risk ratios (RRs) or hazard ratios (HRs).
A RR is a ratio of probabilities of an event between
two groups, and represents the relative likelihood
of a person experiencing an event if they are part
of one group compared with another. A RR should
be calculated at the end of a study, using all
of the data up until a pre-specified endpoint. A
HR represents an instantaneous risk, and hazard
ratios may change when calculated at different
time points. Studies that report hazard ratios will
often use a Cox proportional hazards model, which
makes the assumption that a hazard will stay
proportionally constant throughout the study. One
study (Spruytte et al., 2001) in the present review
also reported odds ratios (OR; more commonly
used for case-control studies), which are a ratio of
the odds of an event between two groups.
The meta-analyses (see Table 3) only included
those studies that used comparable standardized
measures, comparable concepts, and comparable
risk indicator data.
When meta-analyzing results from papers that
split their risk indicator data into varying degrees
of severity, categories indicating moderate severity

were included. If appropriate, risk indicator data
were recoded into their reciprocal form (1/x)
in order to ensure the direction of effect was
consistent and to include additional studies into the
meta-analyses.
Case-control studies
The majority of the case-control studies presented
their results as mean and standard deviations
or odds ratios. Only results from standardized
measures were included in the meta-analyses (see
Table 4).
The outcomes of any meta-analyses using mean
and standard deviations are presented as the
standard mean difference (SMD): the difference
in mean outcome between groups divided by the
standard deviation of outcome among participants.

S. Toot et al.
people with dementia with poorer cognition are
at greater risk of NHP. A meta-analysis of these
studies (see Figure S2) indicated that people with
dementia with greater impairment of cognition
have a significantly increased risk of NHP (RR =
1.06, 95% CI 1.04–1.09, p<0.001).
Five studies using hazard ratios assessed whether
poorer cognition influenced the risk of NHP; four
(Yaffe et al., 2002; Gaugler et al., 2003; 2005;
Harboun et al., 2008; Luppa et al., 2012) reported
that people with dementia with poorer cognition
are at a greater risk of NHP. However, one study
(Gilley et al., 2005) found that poorer cognition did
not significantly increase or decrease risk of NHP.
In a meta-analysis of these studies (see Figure S3),
the results indicated that poorer cognition increases
the risk of NHP (HR = 1.08, 95% CI 1.05–1.18,
p<0.001).
Case-control studies
Five studies assessed whether cognition was a factor
in the risk of NHP. Three of these (Haupt and
Kurz, 1993; Young et al., 1998; de Vugt et al., 2005)
indicated that people with dementia placed in a
nursing home have significantly poorer cognition
than those who remained in the community.
The other two (Steele et al., 1990; Lieberman
and Kramer, 1991) reported that there were no
significant differences between these two groups.
Four of these studies (Steele et al., 1990;
Lieberman and Kramer, 1991; Haupt and Kurz,
1993; de Vugt et al., 2005) were entered into a
meta-analysis (see Figure S4) and those people
with dementia who were placed in a nursing home
had significantly poorer cognition than those who
remained in the community (SMD = −0.36, SE =
0.1, p<0.001).
Young et al. (1998) not included in the meta-
analysis, found that people with dementia admitted
to a nursing home had poorer verbal ability
(p<0.01) and poorer memory (p<0.001) than
those not admitted.
ADL or IADL for the person with dementia
A number of studies looked at ADL or IADL ability
as potential risk factors. For clarity, the present
review separately analyzed studies looking at ADLs,
IADLs, and a combination of ADL/IADLs rather
than collating them into a sole ADL/IADL risk
factor.
ADL
Cohort studies
In the meta-analysis of studies (Gaugler et al., 2000;
Gilley et al., 2004) that reported risk ratios (see
Figure S5), poorer ADL ability neither increased
nor decreased the risk of NHP (RR = 1.05, 95%
CI 0.96–1.15, p = 0.27).
In the meta-analysis of studies (Yaffe et al., 2002;
Harboun et al., 2008) that reported hazard ratios
(see Figure S6), ADL dependency significantly
increased the risk of NHP (HR = 1.26, 95% CI
1.11–1.43, p<0.001).
Four studies were not included in the meta-
analyses and only one of these found that ADL
dependency increased the risk of NHP; Smith et al.
(2000) found that a change in the level of ADL
dependency (from occasional to daily) increased
the risk of NHP (RR = 2.22, paper states that
result is significant but 95% CI and p values are
not provided).
In contrast, Andel et al. (2007) found that an
increase in ADL dependency neither increased nor
decreased the risk of NHP (HR = 1, p value not
provided). Similar findings were reported by Gilley
et al. (2005) (HR = 0.956, 95% CI and p value
not provided). Buhr et al. (2006) did not find ADL
dependencies to be a significant predictor of NHP
(no data provided). However, they found that the
number of tasks performed for a patient increased
the risk of NHP (RR = 1.08, 95% 1.05–1.11,
p value not provided).
Case-control studies
Five studies investigated whether ADL function
for the person with dementia was a risk factor for
NHP. Four of these (Steele et al., 1990; Haupt
and Kurz, 1993; Scott et al., 1997; Young et al.,
1998) reported that ADL were poorer in people
with dementia who were placed in a nursing home
versus those who remained in the community.
One study (de Vugt et al., 2005) found no
difference between these two groups.
Two of these studies (Steele et al., 1990;
Haupt and Kurz, 1993) were entered into a meta-
analysis (see Figure S7) and those people with
dementia who were placed in a nursing home had
significantly more ADL impairments than those
who remained in the community (SMD = 0.47,
SE = 0.2, p = 0.016).
Young et al. (1998) found that people with
dementia
admitted
to
a
nursing
home
had
significantly
greater
ADL
impairments
at
the
beginning of the study than those who continued to
receive care at home (p < 0.01). Scott et al. (1997)
found that people with dementia who declined in
the ability to perform ADL were significantly more
likely to be placed in a nursing home compared
to those with no decline or an improvement
(OR = 3.5, 95% CI 1.9–6.4, p value not provided).
Conversely, de Vugt et al. (2005) found that ADL

“initiative” and ADL “performance” did not differ
between the two groups (p values not provided).
IADL
Cohort studies
Two
studies
found
that
IADL
dependencies
increased the risk of NHP. Gaugler et al. (2003;
2005) found that only if an individual scored in
the higher ranges of IADL dependency (6 or more
out of 8) was there a significant increase in risk of
NHP: 6–6.5 (HR = 1.69, no 95% CI provided,
p = 0.01), 7–7.5 (HR = 1.84, no 95% CI provided,
p = 0.004), 8 (HR = 1.94, no 95% CI provided,
p = 0.003). Harboun et al. (2008) found that IADL
dependencies (help with 2 or more) at baseline
increased the risk of NHP for people with dementia
(HR = 1.5, 95% CI 1.2–1.9, p = 0.001).
Two studies found that IADL dependencies
neither increased nor decreased the risk of NHP.
Buhr et al. (2006) provided no RR, whereas Andel
et al. (2007) found HR = 0.99 (p value not
provided).
ADL/IADL
Cohort studies
Two studies (Severson et al., 1994; Smith et al.,
2001) using risk ratios assessed whether combined
ADL/IADL dependencies influenced the risk of
NHP. Both reported that increased ADL/IADL
dependencies increased the risk of NHP. A meta-
analysis of these studies (see Figure S8) indicated
that increased ADL/IADL dependencies increased
the risk of NHP (RR = 1.7, 95% CI 1.48–2.04,
p < 0.001).
Carer burden
Cohort studies
Three studies (Yaffe et al., 2002; Gaugler et al.,
2003; Gilley et al., 2005) used hazard ratios to
assess the influence of carer burden on risk of
NHP. All three found that greater caregiver burden
increased the risk of NHP. A meta-analysis of these
studies (see Figure S9) found a significant increase
in risk (HR = 1.07, 95% CI 1.03–1.11, p < 0.001).
One study (Gaugler et al., 2000) used risk ratios
to assess the influence of carer burden on risk of
NHP. In this study, “role captivity” significantly
increased the risk of NHP (RR = 1.14, p =
0.01). However, “role overload” (RR = 0.94) and
“worry/strain” (RR = 1.05) did not increase or
decrease the risk of NHP (95% CI and p value not
provided).
Another study (Spruytte et al., 2001) used odds
ratios to assess the link between carer burden and
risk of NHP. This study found that carer burden
did not increase or decrease the risk of NHP (data
not reported by study author).
Case-control studies
Three studies assessed whether carer burden was
a risk factor for NHP. Two of these (Young et al.,
1998; Whitlatch et al., 1999) found that carers of
people with dementia placed in a nursing home
showed significantly higher levels of burden at
baseline than carers of people with dementia who
remained at home (both studies’ results at p<
0.01). Conversely, Haupt and Kurz (1993) found
no significant difference between these groups (no
p value provided).
BPSD
Cohort studies
Six studies found that BPSD increased the risk of
NHP. Gaugler et al. (2000) found that “problematic
behavior” significantly increased the risk of NHP
(RR = 1.10, no CI data provided, p <0.01). Buhr
et al. (2006) found that a unit increase in “behavior
dysregulation” (RR = 1.07, 95% CI 1.04–1.11,
p not provided) and/or “psychotic symptoms”
(RR = 1.06, 95% CI 1.04–1.09, p not provided)
increased risk of NHP and that the highest level
of symptoms on both of these scales increased
the risks further. Gibbons et al. (2002) found that
people with dementia with anxiety symptoms were
at an increased risk of NHP (RR = 1.15, 95%
CI 1.03–1.28, p value not provided). Gilley et al.
(2004) found that certain BPSD increased risk
of NHP; both physical aggression (RR = 2.30,
95% CI 1.41–3.76, p value not provided) and
hallucinations (RR = 1.83, 95% CI 1.27–2.63,
p value not provided) were significant; however,
delusions were not (RR = 0.81, 0.56–1.18, p
not provided). They also found that depression
increased the risk of NHP, (RR = 1.04, 95% CI
1.01–1.08, p not provided). Scarmeas et al. (2007)
found that any “disruptive behavior” increased the
risk of NHP (HR = 1.47, 95% CI 1.10–1.97, p not
provided). Kunik et al. (2010) found that a person
with dementia becoming aggressive significantly
increased the risk of NHP (HR = 2.98, 95% 1.05–
8.49, p =0.004).
Smith et al. (2001) found that “disruptive
behaviors” were not significantly associated with
NHP (data not provided in paper).
Case-control studies
Six studies reported on BPSD as a risk factor for
NHP. Four of these (Steele et al., 1990; Lieberman
and Kramer, 1991; de Vugt et al., 2005; Coehlo
et al., 2007) were entered into a meta-analysis (see

Figure S10) and people with dementia who were
placed in a nursing home had significantly higher
BPSD symptoms than those who remained in the
community (SMD = 0.25, SE = 0.1, p = 0.01).
Not included in the meta-analysis, Young et al.
(1998) found that people with dementia admitted
to a nursing home had significantly more “behavior
problems” than those not admitted (p < 0.001).
Lieberman
and
Kramer
(1991)
also
assessed
“psychiatric problems” and “problem behaviors”
in addition to their standardized measurement of
BPSD, and found no significant difference in these
symptoms between people with dementia who were
placed in a nursing home and those who were not.
Physical health
Cohort studies
Four studies found physical health factors that
increased the risk of NHP. Harboun et al. (2008)
found that a hip fracture within 3 years preceding a
dementia diagnosis significantly increased the risk
of NHP (HR = 2.7, 95% CI 1.1–6.9, p < 0.05).
Luppa et al. (2012) found that mobility impairment
significantly increased the risk of NHP (HR = 2.6,
95% CI 1.29-5.21, p = 0.007). Smith et al. (2000)
found that a change in the number of comorbidities
between pre- and post-diagnosis increased the risk
of NHP (RR = 1.91, 95% CI and p value not
provided; no details were provided on the nature
of these changes). However, Buhr et al. (2006)
found that people with dementia with fewer patient
comorbidities were at a significantly increased risk
of NHP (RR = 1.16, 95% CI 1.12 = 1.20, p value
not provided).
Five studies identified certain physical health
factors that did not influence the risk of NHP.
Gilley et al. (2004) found that neither mobility
nor urinary incontinence increased or decreased
the risk of NHP (mobility: RR = 1.02, 95%
CI
0.85–1.23,
p
value
not
provided;
urinary
incontinence: RR = 1.17, 95% 0.72–1.90, p
value not provided). Smith et al. (2001) found
that
neither
comorbidities
nor
extrapyramidal
symptoms increased or decreased the risk of NHP
(data not reported by study authors). Smith et al.
(2000) found that the number of hospitalizations
or doctor visits did not increase or decrease the
risk of NHP (data not reported by study authors).
Luppa et al. (2012) found that neither visual nor
hearing impairment significantly increased the risk
of NHP (visual impairment: HR = 1.45, 95%
CI 0.85–2.49, p = 0.18; hearing impairment:
HR = 0.69, 95% CI 0.41–1.17, p = 0.17). Andel
et al. (2007) provided no p-values for any of the
following conditions, but reported that they were
non-significant risk factors: arthritis (HR = 0.85);
cancer (HR = 0.93); diabetes (HR = 1.05); chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease/emphysema (HR =
0.85); heart disease (HR = 0.96); incontinence
(HR = 1.14); and stroke (HR = 1.00).
Case-control studies
Two studies looked at whether physical health
factors were a risk for NHP. Scott et al. (1997)
found that, in a univariate analyses, a decline
in “locomotion” was associated with NHP (p =
0.011). However, when “locomotion” was entered
into the final model of NHP prediction, it was no
longer significant (no data reported by the study
authors). Lieberman and Kramer (1991) found no
significant difference in “medical problems” and
“neurological signs” between people with dementia
placed in a nursing home and those who were not.
Carer mental health-depression
Cohort studies
Five studies found that carer depression did not
influence the risk of NHP: four (Yaffe et al., 2002;
Gaugler et al., 2003; Gilley et al., 2005; Buhr et al.,
2006) used hazard ratios and one (Gaugler et al.,
2000) reported risk ratios. In the studies that used
hazard ratios, the data were not reported by the
study authors. Gaugler et al. (2000) found that
carer depression did not increase or decrease the
risk of NHP (RR = 0.97, 95% CI and p value not
provided).
Case-control studies
Two studies investigated whether carer depression
was a risk factor for NHP. Whitlatch et al.
(1999) found that higher levels of carer depression
significantly increased the odds of NHP (OR 1.01,
p < 0.05). Coehlo et al. (2007) found that carers
of people with dementia placed in a nursing home
showed significantly more depressive symptoms
than those that were not admitted to a nursing
home (p < 0.001).
Other carer risk factors
Cohort studies
Buhr et al. (2006) found that lower life satisfaction
amongst carers increased the risk of NHP for
people with dementia (RR =1.52, 95% 1.27–1.81,
p value not provided). Gaugler et al. (2003; 2005)
reported that poor carer health increased the risk
of NHP (HR = 1.44, no 95% CI provided, p =
0.004) and that carer unmet need at the second
highest level increased the risk of NHP (HR =
1.18, no 95% CI provided, p = 0.05). Conversely,
they found that carer IADL limitations (at any
level) did not influence the risk of NHP (IADL

limitations = 0.1–1, HR = 1.11, no 95% CI
provided, p = 0.26; IADL limitation = 1.1–2,
HR = 0.9, no 95% CI provided, p = 0.38;
IADL limitations = 2.1–8, HR = 1.12, no 95%
CI provided, p = 0.27) but that, if IADLs had
worsened (1 activity or more) during a 6-month
interval, this significantly decreased the risk of
NHP (HR = 0.68, no 95% CI provided, p = 0.01).
Harboun et al. (2008) found that help provided
by carers did not influence the risk of NHP for
people with dementia (HR = 1, 95% CI 0.6–1.7,
p value not provided). Gilley et al. (2005) found
that carer positive affect did not influence the risk
of NHP (data not reported by study authors) and
that caregiving satisfaction significantly decreased
the risk of NHP (HR= 0.929, 95% CI 0.88–
0.98, p < 0.01). Spruytte et al. (2001) found
that neither the number of caregiving tasks nor
carer satisfaction from caregiving influenced the
odds of NHP (no data reported by study authors)
and that a higher quality of caregiving relationship
significantly decreased the odds of NHP (OR =
0.92, no 95% CI provided, p = 0.02).
Case-control studies
Six studies investigated other carer risk factors
for NHP, five of which indicated a number of
significant findings. Coehlo et al. (2007) found
that carers of people with dementia placed in
a nursing home had significantly poorer health
(p < 0.05) and significantly more negative caregiver
experiences (p < 0.05) than carers of those who
remained at home. De Vugt et al. (2005) found
that carers of people with dementia placed in a
nursing home were significantly more distressed
(p = 0.022) and had a significantly lower sense
of competence (p = 0.032) at baseline. However,
there was no significant difference in mood between
carers of people with dementia who had been
placed and those whose care recipients were not
placed (p value not provided by study authors).
Lieberman and Kramer (1991) found that caregiver
stress (indicated by the presence of various family
problems) was significantly higher in carers of
people with dementia placed in nursing homes
(p < 0.001). Young et al. (1998) found that carers’
personal expectations (their interpretation of their
care responsibility) were significantly higher in
carers of individuals who were placed in a nursing
home (p < 0.05). However, there was no significant
difference
between
carers
regarding
normative
expectations (care with respect to a particular
kinship relationship). Carers of individuals placed
in a nursing home were also found to have
significantly lower attachment to the person placed
(p < 0.01). Pot et al. (2001) found that carers
of
placed
individuals
were
significantly
more
stressed than carers of those not placed (p < 0.05).
However, they found no significant differences in
carer psychological distress or carer extraversion
between these groups.
Whitlatch et al. (1999) found that caregiver
social support did not increase or decrease the
odds of NHP (OR = 1.01, 95% CI or p value not
provided).
Environmental
Cohort studies
Gaugler et al. (2003; 2005) found that utilizing
low amounts of “chore” services (1–36 hours in
preceding 6 months) was significantly associated
with an increased risk of NHP (HR = 1.34, no
95% CI provided, p < 0.001). However, medium
(37–103 hours), high (104+ hours), or an increased
amount of chore service utilization (an increase of
48 hours over 6 months or more) did not influence
the risk of NHP (medium, HR = 1.04, no 95%
CI provided, p = 0.71; high, HR = 1.21, no 95%
CI provided, p = 0.12; increase, HR = 1.17, no
95% CI provided, p = 0.21). They also found
that utilizing adult day care services in the low
(1–30 days in preceding 6 months) or high (78+
days) categories significantly increased the risk of
NHP (Low: HR = 1.30, no 95% CI provided,
p < 0.001; High: HR = 1.30, no 95% CI provided,
p = 0.02). Neither medium (31–77 days) nor an
increased amount of adult day service utilization
(increase of 24 days over 6 months or more) was
associated with a risk of NHP (medium, HR =
1.07, no 95% CI provided, p = 0.54; increased,
HR = 1.02, no 95% CI provided, p = 0.91).
Utilizing medium amounts of personal care (61–
207 hours in preceding 6 months) significantly
decreased the risk of NHP (HR = 0.78, no 95%
CI provided, p = 0.03). However, low, high, or an
increased amount of personal care utilization was
not associated with the risk of NHP.
Gaugler et al. (2000) found that none of
paid help (RR = 1.02), amount of family help
(RR = 1), family support – sitting with relative
(RR = 1.10), and family support – taking relative
out (RR = 1.06) influenced the risk of NHP
(95% CI or p values not provided). However,
they also found that family support with ADLs
and with overnight respite significantly decreased
the risk of NHP (ADLs: RR =0.69, no 95%
CI values provided, p< 0.01; overnight respite:
RR = 0.59, no 95% CI values provided, p <
0.01). Spruytte et al. (2001) found that lower costs
of care did not influence the risk of NHP (no
data reported by study author), but that home
adaptations significantly decreased the odds of

NHP (OR = 0.1, 95% CI not provided, p = 0.006).
Harboun et al. (2008) found that use of health and
social care services significantly decreased the risk
of NHP (HR = 0.5, 95% CI 0.3–0.9, p < 0.05).
Case-control studies
Two
studies
assessed
whether
environmental
factors were risk factors for NHP. Whitlatch et al.
(1999) found that utilizing in-home respite assist-
ance and out-of-home 24-hour respite assistance
significantly increased the odds of NHP (in-home:
OR = 1.5, 95% CI not provided, p < 0.05;
out-of-home: OR = 2.22, 95% CI not provided,
p < 0.05). However, utilizing day care respite did
not impact on the odds of NHP (OR = 1.16,
95% CI or p value not provided). Lieberman and
Kramer (1991) found that there was no significant
difference in overall service utilization between
those who were placed in a nursing home and those
who were not (p = 0.16). However, when split
into component services, three services were found
to show significant differences: those people who
were placed in a nursing home were utilizing more
healthcare services (p < 0.05), fewer homemaker
services (p < 0.05), and fewer medical clinics (p <
0.05) than those who remained in the community.
Data on the other component services were not
reported by the study authors.
Other
Cohort studies
Two studies reported other factors that increased
the risk of NHP. Smith et al. (2001) found that
“unsafe behaviors” increased the risk of NHP
(RR = 2.38, 95% CI 1.65 – 3.45, p value not
provided). Spruytte et al. (2001) found that a higher
“level of functioning” of a person with dementia
significantly increased the odds of NHP (OR =
1.09, no 95% CI provided, p = 0.027).
Discussion
The causes of care home admission for people with
dementia are multifactorial and often the result
of complex interactions between characteristics of
the person with dementia, their caregivers, service
providers, and the environment. Many of these
risk factors are potentially modifiable and, as such,
could be targeted by interventions to reduce the
risk of institutionalization. We have collated and
analyzed the available evidence with regard to these
risk factors and make tentative recommendations
as to how these might be addressed by community
services, with the aim of supporting people with
dementia and their carers to remain living and
coping within their own homes for as long as
possible. This is the first detailed systematic review
and meta-analyses of a large field of research in this
area and, as such, provides important information
as to the factors most consistently linked with
nursing home placement, which might therefore
be targeted by interventions, and to those where
findings are less consistent and where further
research is necessary.
An expected and robust finding, borne out by
meta-analyses, is that poorer cognition is consist-
ently linked with an increased risk of nursing home
placement for people with dementia. Cognitive
enhancement strategies, both pharmacological and
non-pharmacological, might therefore be expected
to delay institutionalization. There is some evidence
that this is so where pharmacological interventions
are concerned (Lopez et al., 2009), but no such
evidence as yet for cognitive stimulation therapy
and the latter may be an important area for
future research. Furthermore, the increased risk
associated with more severe cognitive impairment
suggests
a
need
for
greater
surveillance
as
dementia progresses, so that interventions can be
targeted effectively toward other unmet needs and
risk factors for institutionalization in the most
vulnerable.
One might reasonably predict an association
between increased functional dependence and risk
of institutionalization and, indeed, three of our
four meta-analyses did demonstrate a significant
association between impairments in activities of
daily living or instrumental activities of daily living
and risk of nursing home placement. However, a
fourth meta-analysis and a number of individual
studies reviewed did not find this association.
This variability might relate, to some extent, to
differences between studies in the specific ADL
analyzed, and future research could usefully focus
on particular ADL in an attempt to elucidate
the most important functional limitations leading
to nursing home placement. Variability in ADL
findings might also result from the fact that affected
activities tend to vary by stage of dementia, with
different implications for quality of life at each
stage (Giebel et al., 2015). However, it is also quite
conceivable that institutionalization is driven less
by the functional dependency itself and more by
the extent to which this need can be met and
appropriate interventions provided for the person
with dementia and his/her caregiver within their
own home.
The studies reviewed that measured the use
of various support services are of interest in this
regard, yet their results must be analyzed with
caution if conceptualizing service use as a proxy
measure of need. Although a high level of service

use is likely to reflect a high level of need, the
converse is not necessarily true and a low level of
service use might reflect either minimal need or
an unspecified level of unmet need. This might
explain the findings by Gaugler et al. (2003; 2005)
that a low level of domestic chore service use and
both high and low (but not medium) levels of
adult day care service use were associated with
an increased risk of institutionalization, whereas a
medium (but not high or low) level of personal
care service utilization appeared to decrease this
risk. Similarly, Lieberman and Kramer (1991)
found that individuals placed in nursing homes had
been accessing lower levels of ‘homemaker’ services
prior to admission than those who remained
in the community, and Whitlatch et al. (1999)
found an increased risk of institutionalization
amongst those who had been in receipt of in-
home respite assistance and out-of-home 24-hour
respite services, presumably representing the most
dependent individuals.
It is therefore incumbent upon community
support services not only to recognize vulnerability
amongst those individuals requiring the highest
levels of social support, but also to ensure that
all
levels
of
need
are
properly
assessed
and
that appropriate interventions are offered to meet
even
low-to-medium
levels
of
identified
need
which, without such support, could result in
premature institutionalization. Some studies of
case management, aimed at enhancing the co-
ordination between different agencies involved in
community dementia care, have shown delays in
time to institutionalization, but findings have been
inconsistent and there is a need for further research
to establish the most effective components of this
approach (Reilly et al., 2015).
It
is
acknowledged
that
caring
for
people
with dementia is generally associated with high
levels
of
psychological
distress
and
reduced
physical health in caregivers (Ballard et al., 2009;
Afram et al., 2014). The former study in eight
European countries also noted both the influence
of
caregiver
burden
and
the
inability
of
the
informal caregiver to care for the patient as
reasons for admission. It is perhaps not surprising,
therefore, that our review and meta-analysis show
caregiver burden to be significantly associated with
an increased risk of care home placement for
people with dementia. Some of the more specific
caregiver factors that seemed to increase risk of
institutionalization were increased role captivity,
poorer general health, higher stress, a poorer
caregiving relationship, and lower attachment to
the person with dementia. Findings with regard
to carer depression and satisfaction were more
equivocal, with some studies reporting a higher risk
of placement in those with lower satisfaction and
more depression and others reporting no such as-
sociation. Further research is therefore required in
these areas. Higher levels of carer stress were noted
in cases where people with dementia were placed
in nursing homes and this can often be the single
determining factor for this transition.
It is generally accepted that BPSD are a major
cause of nursing home placement for people with
dementia, and the findings of our review and
meta-analyses confirm the significant role played
by this diverse group of symptoms. Among the
more specific symptoms found to increase the
risk of institutionalization were physical aggression,
psychosis, anxiety, hallucinations, and depression.
BPSD exemplify the complex patient–caregiver–
environment interactions that so often result in
care home admissions and, as such, are a key
target for interventions aimed at reducing both
the distress experienced by those involved and the
risk of institutionalization. A pragmatic approach
to
the
assessment
and
management
of
these
symptoms should encompass the bio-psycho-social
sphere (Kales et al., 2015), and the drive to
reduce inappropriate prescribing of antipsychotic
medications (Banerjee, 2009), coupled with an
increasing appreciation of the overall importance
of these symptoms, led to the publication of
best practice guidance in the UK (Alzheimer’s
Society, 2011). Multi-disciplinary interventions by
specialist teams at lower levels of disturbance might
prevent deterioration and delay nursing home
placement (Brodaty et al., 2003).
Several studies have examined the influence of
physical health factors on risk of institutionalization
in people with dementia, with mixed findings.
Hip
fracture,
reduced
mobility,
and
multiple
comorbidities may be risk factors for care home
placement, but findings were inconsistent between
studies and meta-analysis was not possible owing
to
the
differing
measures
used.
Nevertheless,
it
seems
intuitively
appropriate
that
specialist
teams supporting people with dementia and their
caregivers should focus not only on psychological
and social care needs, but also on physical health
and wellbeing, to detect and manage both acute
and chronic medical conditions, including pain,
and to minimize the risk of polypharmacy in the
elderly and cognitively impaired, developing the
early work of Jolley and Arie (1992). Such inter-
ventions might reduce the risks of BPSD, delirium,
and hospital admission (Toot et al., 2013).
Finally, the geographical location of studies may
have shaped the findings. Verbeek et al. (2015)
found caregiver burden and ADL dependence were
common factors across eight European countries.
However, they concluded that admission to nursing

home care is context-specific, given wide variation
in factors associated with institutionalization across
countries.
Limitations
Studies included used a wide variety of measures
across different domains and it was not always
possible to compare these directly. Hence, we
were unable to draw firm conclusions about the
significance or otherwise of certain potential risk
factors for care home placement. Nevertheless, we
were able to combine other measures with sufficient
confidence to carry out meta-analyses of a number
of potential risk factors with apparently robust
findings.
Quality of the individual studies varied, but we
believe that our use of a rating scale to assign
levels of evidence to each study and include only
those independently rated by our reviewers as high
quality will have served to maximize the reliability
of the findings of this review.
We
acknowledge
that
our
inferences
with
regard to interventions that might help to reduce
the risk of nursing home placement must be
regarded as tentative and that, in many cases,
further studies will be required to test these
assumptions. Nevertheless, we believe that the
identification of potentially modifiable risk factors
for institutionalization provides fertile ground for
such studies to be designed and conducted.
Additionally, studies in this review were con-
ducted in several countries and regions where a
range of state-supported care or services could
be available. Some of the inconsistencies in the
analyses presented in this paper could be explained
by the lack of uniformity of services that carers
can receive. Also, in most cases we did not know
whether studies took place in any rural areas,
therefore the lack of data from rural areas suggests
more research studies are required in this area.
Conclusions
Supporting people with dementia and their carers
to live and cope within their own homes for as long
as possible is a valid aim for services with the remit
of helping people to live well with dementia. This
review suggests that poorer cognition, BPSD, and
caregiver burden consistently increase the risk of
nursing home placement for these individuals. We
propose therefore that specialist multidisciplinary
teams should focus on cognitive enhancement
strategies, assessment and management of BPSD,
and carer education and support in order to tackle
these potentially modifiable risk factors. Further,
ongoing research will be essential to selecting the
most effective strategies for delivering these aims,
as well as to elucidating the potential significance
of other risk factors, such as carer depression and
impairments in individual ADL, and the complex
relationship between functional dependencies and
service provision, where study findings to date have
been more diverse.
