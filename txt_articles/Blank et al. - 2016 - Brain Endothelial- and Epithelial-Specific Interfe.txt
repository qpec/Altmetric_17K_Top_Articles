In Brief
Sickness behavior and cognitive
dysfunction occur frequently during RNA
virus infection by unknown mechanisms.
Prinz and colleagues show that virus-
induced sickness behavior is induced by
interferon receptor chain 1 (IFNAR1)
engagement on brain endothelial and
epithelial cells that in turn influence
neuronal signaling to drive cognitive

SUMMARY
Sickness behavior and cognitive dysfunction occur
frequently by unknown mechanisms in virus-in-
fected individuals with malignancies treated with
type I interferons (IFNs) and in patients with auto-
immune disorders. We found that during sickness
behavior, single-stranded RNA viruses, double-
stranded RNA ligands, and IFNs shared pathways
involving engagement of melanoma differentia-
tion-associated protein 5 (MDA5), retinoic acid-
inducible gene 1 (RIG-I), and mitochondrial antiviral
signaling
protein
(MAVS),
and
subsequently
induced IFN responses specifically in brain endo-
thelia and epithelia of mice. Behavioral alterations
were specifically dependent on brain endothelial
and epithelial IFN receptor chain 1 (IFNAR). Using
gene profiling, we identified that the endothelia-
derived
chemokine
ligand
CXCL10
mediated
behavioral changes through impairment of synaptic
plasticity. These results identified brain endothelial
and epithelial cells as natural gatekeepers for virus-
induced sickness behavior, demonstrated tissue
specific IFNAR engagement, and established the
CXCL10-CXCR3 axis as target for the treatment
of behavioral changes during virus infection and
type I IFN therapy.
INTRODUCTION
There is a large amount of literature describing the impact of
psychological states such as stress, anxiety, and depression
on the immune system. In addition, a substantial number of arti-
cles have been published indicating that the immune system, in
turn, can affect psychological and cognitive function (Allison and
Ditor, 2014). However, the underlying signaling pathways and
cell types involved are less well known. The observation that
common symptoms of viral infections frequently include mood
changes such as depressive-like behavior, cognitive deficits,
somnolence, headache, and general feeling of malaise (Cun-
ningham et al., 2007) may provide an entre
´ e into studying
this link between the immune system and behavior. Viruses
that are known to induce behavioral changes (or ‘‘viral sickness
behavior’’) as part of the acute phase response include single-
stranded (ss)RNA viruses such as influenza or double-stranded
(ds)RNA enteroviruses (Dantzer, 2001). Similarly, vesicular sto-
matitis virus (a ssRNA virus) can induce symptoms of viral sick-
ness behavior in affected individuals (Machida et al., 2013). Type
I interferons (IFNs), such as IFN-a and IFN-b, are used in humans
for the treatment of malignancies such as hairy cell leukemia,
T cell lymphoma of the skin, malignant melanoma, hepatitis C

901
 virus infection (HCV), and multiple sclerosis (Bekisz et al., 2013).
In addition to their therapeutic effects, type I IFNs can cause a
number of side effects in patients, including symptoms associ-
ated with depression such as fatigue, insomnia, irritability, loss
of appetite, as well as cognitive changes (Leuschen et al.,
2004). Despite its clinical importance, the mechanisms underly-
ing type I IFN-induced depression and cognitive impairment
have not been rigorously characterized in research studies.
All viruses produce dsRNA during replication, regardless
of the form of nucleic acid carried by the virion (Majde, 2000).
dsRNA associated with ssRNA viruses, such as influenza, is
thought to be derived primarily from annealing of ssRNA interme-
diates (Majde, 2000). There are several pattern-recognition re-
ceptors implicated in recognition of viral nucleic acids including
the membrane bound Toll-like receptors (TLRs), the cytoplasmic
helicases RIG-I (retinoic acid-inducible gene I), and the mela-
noma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) (Pichlmair and
Reis e Sousa, 2007). RIG-I controls innate immune responses
to a wide range of RNA viruses, including influenza and vesicular
stomatitis virus, whereas MDA5 controls responses to certain
picorna viruses (Pichlmair and Reis e Sousa, 2007). dsRNA
carrying a 50-triphosphate (3pRNA) has been identified as the
natural ligand for RIG-I and serves as a selective trigger for
RIG-I signaling (Hornung et al., 2006). In contrast, the natural
ligand for MDA5 is less well-defined, but there is evidence for
the involvement of higher order RNA structures and polyino-
sinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)), an artificial dsRNA, in MDA5
activation (Kato et al., 2006). MDA5 activation by complexed
poly(I:C) requires cytoplasmic delivery (for example, with polye-
thylenimine (PEI) derivates), whereas non-complexed poly(I:C)
activates endosomal TLR3 signaling that induces high levels
of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) (Kato
et al., 2006). Upon receptor engagement by the respective
ligands, RIG-I or MDA5 interact with the adaptor protein inter-
feron-b promoter stimulator 1 (IPS-1), also known as mitochon-
drial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS), to activate downstream
signaling cascades that lead to the production of IFNs that coun-
teract the pro-inflammatory cytokines. Similar to IFNs, synthetic
dsRNA or virus-derived dsRNA also stimulate sickness behavior
indistinguishable from that of influenza virus infection (Kimura-
Takeuchi et al., 1992), suggesting similar pathophysiological
mechanisms leading to the clinical phenotype. Still, the principal
molecular basis and cellular components involved in this disor-
der have not been explored in detail. In this study, we found
that in vivo synthetic dsRNAs, a prototype RNA virus, and re-
combinant type I IFN, all shared the ability to induce cognitive
impairment and mood changes. Peripheral IFN-b activated inter-
feron receptor chain 1 (IFNAR) expressed on brain endothelia
and epithelia, which released the cytokine CXCL10 into the brain
parenchyma where neuronal function was compromised.
RESULTS
RNA Viruses-Induced Depression Shows ISG15
Expression in Brain Endothelial and Epithelial Cells
To investigate the behavioral changes associated with systemic
ssRNA virus infection, we carried out a forced swim test (FST)
in mice challenged with the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-M2.
Exposed mice showed a depressive-like behavior (Figure 1A)
with significantly higher immobility times compared to controls.
These behavioral differences were transient and present 24 hr
post-infection(hourspost-infection,hpi)butwereabsent8weeks
post-infection (weeks post-infection, wpi). VSV-M2-associated
behavioral changes were unlikely to have been induced by direct
viral infection of the central nervous system (CNS) as shown by
an absent viable virus titer (Figure 1B).
We then carried out immunohistochemical examination of IFN-
stimulated gene (ISG)15 expression in brain sections of infected
mice (Figure 1C; Figure S1C). The ISG15 signal was detectable
in brain endothelial cells (including capillaries, arterioles, arteries,
and venules) of different regions, such as cortex and hippocam-
pus as well as in the meninges, ependymal cells and epithelial
cells of the choroid plexus 24 hpi (Figures S2D and S2E),
whereas no other CNS cells such as neurons or glial cells ex-
pressed it.
We next assessed endogenous type I IFN using a biolumines-
cence method that takes advantage of an IFN-b reporter system
(Lienenklaus et al., 2009). We found a strong tissue-specific in-
duction of IFN-b following infection with VSV-M2, which was
restricted to secondary lymphoid organs with no significant
signal from brain tissue (Figure 1D). Similar data were obtained
using an ELISA-based approach after infection (Figure S3A).
To determine the contribution of plasmacytoid dendritic cells
(pDCs) to the observed sickness behavior, we treated mice
with a pDC-depleting antibody. pDC depletion resulted in a
robust protection from virus-induced depressive-like behavior
(Figures 1E and 1F). Together, these data indicated that cyto-
kine production by pDCs or alternatively the presence of DCs
activated brain endothelia and epithelia and was essential for
VSV-M2-evoked sickness behavior.
MAVS Modulates RNA Virus Ligand-Induced Behavior
and Cognitive Impairment
VSV-M2 is recognized by cytosolic RIG-I (Jensen and Thomsen,
2012). Notably, 50-triphosphate RNA molecules derived from
either viral RNA or from the synthetically produced 3pRNA can
also induce RIG-I activation (Dann et al., 2012), whereas MDA5
stimulation is achieved using complexed poly(I:C), a synthetic
analog of viral dsRNA (Dann et al., 2012). To test whether the
RIG-I and MDA5 ligands 3pRNA and poly(I:C) can be used in
their complexed structures to decipher RNA virus-induced sick-
ness behavior in vivo, we first compared the tissue-specific
signaling pathways after systemic challenge with VSV-M2 and
the RIG-I and MDA5 ligands and found that type I IFN-regulated
pathways were shared by all experimental groups (Figures 2A
and 2B).
To
determine
whether
RNA
virus-induced
depression-
like mood changes are dependent on the adaptor MAVS, we
challenged mice lacking MAVS with 3pRNA or poly(I:C) in their
complexed structures (Figure 2C). Similar to wild-type mice chal-
lenged with VSV-M2 (Figure 1A), the RIG-I and MDA5 ligands
robustly prolonged the immobility time in the FST. Furthermore,
3pRNA- and poly(I:C)-evoked depressive-like behavior was
dependent on the presence of MAVS (Figure 2C). Likewise,
ligand-induced impairment of spatial learning in the Morris water
maze (MWM) test was rescued in mice lacking MAVS, whereas
motoric abilities were not altered (Figure 2D). Impairment of
memory induced by RIG-I and MDA5 agonists was found to
902

 depend on the presence of MAVS (Figure 2E), whereas visual
abilities remained unaltered by treatment (Figure 2F). Accord-
ingly, the IFN response in hippocampal endothelial cells, as
visualized by ISG15 immunohistochemistry, was abolished in
Mavs �/� mice treated with RIG-I or MDA5 ligands (Figure 2G;
Figure S1).
We next examined whether recombinant mouse IFN-b might
evoke similar behavioral and cognitive changes by utilizing the
same pathways. Mavs�/� mice were challenged with recombi-
nant IFN-b that was able to significantly increase the immobility
in the FST (Figure 2H) but, in contrast to the RIG-I and MDA5 li-
gands (Figure 2C), the induction of depressive-like behavior was
independent from the presence of MAVS (Figure 2H). Similarly,
spatial learning in the MWM test was strongly reduced in the
presence of recombinant mouse IFN-b and, likewise, did not
require MAVS (Figure 2I). Finally, IFN-b treatment significantly
decreased memory recall that was not rescued in mice lacking
MAVS (Figure 2J), whereas the latency to find the visible platform
was not influenced (Figure 2K). In line with these observations,
IFN-b induced a detectable interferon signal in brain endothelia
in both Mavs+/+ and Mavs�/� mice (Figure 2L; Figures S1, S2B,
and S2C). These results show that recombinant IFN-b and
3pRNA and poly(I:C) induced major changes in behavior and
cognition that were comparable to those observed after VSV-
M2 infection. The effects of VSV-M2 infection and of the viral
RNA analogs were dependent on the presence of the adaptor
molecule MAVS, while effects mediated through recombinant
IFN-b did not require this pathway.
IFNAR1 on Neural Cells Is Not Responsible for Sickness-
Behavior
To assess the role and function of the type I interferon receptor
(IFNAR1) in virus-induced behavioral and cognitive changes,
we tested viral analogs in either IFNAR1-competent or deficient

 mice (Figure 3A). Ifnar1+/+ mice developed depressive-like
behavior upon RIG-I and MDA5 activation, whereas Ifnar1�/�
mice were protected from these behavioral changes. In addition,
the lack of IFNAR1 was protective for 3pRNA and poly(I:C)-asso-
ciated impairment of spatial learning (Figure 3B) and memory
(Figure 3C), and resulted in the blockade of ISG15 induction in
brain endothelial cells (Figure 3E; Figure S1), whereas the latency
to find the visible platform was not influenced (Figure 3D). Corre-
spondingly, IFN-b-induced sickness effects were absent in
Ifnar1�/� mice subjected to the FST (Figure 3F) and the MWM
test (Figures 3G–3I), with no detectable ISG15 signals (Figure 3J;

To determine whether IFNAR1 expres-
sion on CNS-resident neuroectodermal
cells or myeloid cells, including microglia,
limits the induction of IFN-linked sickness
behavior, we crossed conditional (floxed)
IFNAR1 mice with transgenic mouse lines expressing the Cre re-
combinase under the control of either the nestin or the LysM pro-
moter. As we have shown previously (Prinz et al., 2008), Ifnar1fl/fl
NesCre mice exhibit a highly efficient IFNAR1 deletion on all neu-
roectodermal cells (neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes),
whereas Ifnar1fl/fl LysMCre mice reveal high IFNAR1 recombina-
tion especially in peripheral myeloid cells (Prinz et al., 2008).
Upon IFN-b challenge, all Ifnar1fl/fl NesCre and Ifnar1fl/fl LysMCre
mice developed clinical signs of depressive-like behavior in the
FST (Figure 4A), impaired learning (Figure 4B) and decreased
memory (Figure 4C) in the MWM test, whereas visual ability
was not influenced (Figure 4D). In mice of all genotypes, type 1

 IFN induced ISG15 signals in hippocampal endothelia (Figure 4E;
Figure S1). These findings were consistent with elevated IFN-b
levels observed in the circulation but not locally in the brain after
VSV-M2 infection (Figure S3A). Together, these data indicate
that IFNAR1 was involved in IFN-b-associated sickness condi-
tions. However, neither neuroectodermal nor myeloid-specific
IFNAR1 was an essential modulator of the clinical symptoms.
Non-redundant Functions of Brain Endothelial and
Epithelial IFNAR1 for Disease Course
Brain endothelial and epithelial cells are essential parts of the
blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the blood-cerebrospinal fluid
barrier (BCSFB). As such, they are exposed to proinflammatory
mediators as well as danger signals during infections (Dyrna
et al., 2013), and therefore might function as decisive cells medi-
ating RNA virus- and IFN-mediated sickness behavior. We first
analyzed Ifnar1fl/flSlco1c1CreERT2 mice, which were targeting
IFNAR1 specifically on brain endothelial and epithelial cells after
injecting tamoxifen, for cell specificity of IFNAR1 deletion (Fig-
ure 5A, Figure S4C). Only CD31+ brain endothelial cells, but
not cells from the heart or lung, showed a strong deletion of
Ifnar1 mRNA four weeks after tamoxifen (TAM) application,
indicating high recombination specificity. As a consequence,
STAT1 protein phosphorylation was markedly decreased in
IFN-b-stimulated brain endothelial cells (Figure 5B). TAM-treated
Slco1c1-CreERT2tdTomatofl/fl mice, which possess the fluoro-
phore tdTomato sitting behind a floxed stop codon in the
Rosa26 locus, indicated additional recombination in epithelial
cells of the choroid plexus, with no detectable recombination
in meninges or ependymal cells (Figure S4C).
We next challenged Ifnar1fl/flSlco1c1CreERT2 mice with IFN-b
and measured immobility (Figure 5C) as well as spatial learning
and memory capabilities (Figures 5D–5F). Clinical effects were
blunted in mice lacking IFNAR1 only on brain endothelial and
epithelial cells, whereas speed and visual abilities were not
affected. Ifnar1fl/flSlco1c1CreERT2 mice subjected to VSV-M2
were also protected from depressive-like behavior (Figure 5G).
Accordingly, the IFN response on endothelia was diminished in
Ifnar1fl/flSlco1c1CreERT2 mice upon IFN-b or VSV-M2 adminis-
tration (Figure 5H; Figure 1). The BBB was still intact following

transcripts occurred (Figure 4A). Thus, protection in Ifnar1fl/fl
Slco1c1CreERT2 mice indicated a vital role of brain endothelia
and epithelia for RNA virus-induced changes of cognition and
behavior.

 CXCL10-CXCR3 Signaling Mediates Sickness Behavior
To better understand how brain endothelial cells modulated IFN-
induced sickness behavior, we challenged endothelia with IFN-b
and investigated their transcription profile (Figure 6A). The dose
of 500 U/mL IFN-b was determined to induce the highest ISG15
expression (Figure S3B). Subsequently, cells were treated for
24 hr with IFN-b and the most significant functional group of
genes was found to lie within the chemokine and cytokine mod-
ule (Figure 6A). Many chemokines, especially CXCL9, CXCL10,
and CXCL11, were strongly upregulated, whereas no overt in-
duction of genes indicative of pro-inflammatory responses
were detectable, suggesting a primary chemokine-mediated
response of brain endothelial cells upon IFN-b challenge. Induc-
tion of chemokines was confirmed using qRT-PCR (Figure 6B)
and ELISA (Figure 6C) with particularly high release of CXCL10
(Figure 6D). Intra-endothelial production of CXCL10 was evident
upon VSV-M2 or virus ligand challenge and after IFN-b incuba-
tion (Figure 6E). In response to VSV-M2 infection, elevated
CXCL10 protein concentrations were detectable in brain homog-
enates, in spleen and in blood serum (Figure S3C). CXCR3 as
joint receptor for CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 was found to
be expressed in the brain on neurons and microglia (Figure S5A).
Mice lacking CXCR3 or CXCL10 subjected to IFN-b treatment
were protected from depressive-like behavior (Figure 6F) and
impairment of spatial learning and memory (Figures 6G and
6H), whereas the visual system was unaffected (Figure 6I). Endo-
thelial cell induction of ISG15 was independent of the presence
of CXCR3 or CXCL10 (Figure 6J; Figure 1). Virus-induced
depressive-like changes were absent in Cxcr3�/� mice (Fig-
ure 6K) despite a strong ISG15 induction in endothelia of brain
sections and normal gene expression in brain endothelia from
Cxcr3�/� mice in response to IFN-b when compared to wild-
type (WT) brain endothelia (Figure 6L; Figure S1; Figure S4D).
Elevation of CXCL10 in the brain (Figure S3C) did not cause acti-
vation of microglia (Figure S5B) nor the recruitment of immune
cells to the brain (Figure S6).
We next examined doublecortin (DCX)+ cells in the dentate gy-
rus, where a reduction of DCX+ cells can account for cognitive
impairment as seen in the MWM and increased depressive-
like behavior (Ben Abdallah et al., 2013). However, systemic
IFN-b treatment had no effect on the number of DCX+ cells (Fig-
ure S5C). Next, we examined the synaptic plasticity of adult hip-
pocampal neurons after challenge with CXCL10. Field potentials
were recorded in the stratum radiatum of the hippocampal CA1
subregion by stimulation of the fibers between CA3 and CA1
(Figure 6M). Hippocampal slices were incubated with CXCL10
causing reduced paired-pulse facilitation (ratio of second pulse
to the first pulse), which is indicative of impaired presynaptic
transmitter release (Zucker and Regehr, 2002). The presence
of CXCL10 also markedly weakened synaptic long-term potenti-
ation (LTP), an electrophysiological model of learning and mem-
ory (Figure 6N). In freely behaving mice, high-frequency afferent
stimulation resulted in robust LTP in the hippocampal CA1 region
of vehicle-treated animals and persisted for at least 24 hr.
Treatment with CXCL10 resulted in a significant impairment of
LTP. The impairment obtained after high-frequency stimulation
(HFS) was significant throughout the whole recording period,
which lasted for 25 hr (Figure 6O).
These data collectively suggest that peripheral challenge with
VSV-M2, 3pRNA, or complexed poly(I:C) caused MAVS activa-
tion in pDCs and subsequent IFNAR1 activation specifically on
brain vessels, followed by an induction of soluble factors such
as CXCL10 derived from brain endothelia and epithelia. These
soluble factors inhibited short-term- and long-term synaptic

 plasticity, which positively correlated with the observed behav-
ioral phenotypes.
DISCUSSION
Here we identified the cellular targets and the underlying molec-
ular pathways involved in RNA virus and type I IFN-associated
sickness syndrome. We demonstrated that VSV-M2, synthetic
dsRNA ligands, as well as IFN-b shared the ability to induce
cognitive impairment and behavioral dysfunction by affecting
similar cells, and by employing identical molecular switches.
We found that the splenic MAVS pathway and its activation by
RNA ligands with subsequent stimulation of RIG-I and MDA5
as equivalent to VSV-M2 infection were important for sickness
behavior. The presence of IFNs in the circulation stimulated
IFNAR1-dependent production of chemokines by brain endothe-
lial and epithelial cells. These chemokines could then mediate
fundamental changes in synaptic network function and coupled
cognitive functions by engagement of neuronal CXCR3.
Our data also provide evidence that dendritic cells, especially
pDCs, are the first and main immunoregulatory cell type that re-
sponds to ssRNA infection or exposure to dsRNA ligands that in-
duces a complex cascade of cellular events that lead to sickness
behavior and cognitive dysfunction. However, whether pDC-
derived type I IFNs or other DC-related functions provide protec-
tion from virus-induced sickness behavior remains unclear.
Several studies have found that type I IFNs have several strong
effects on the CNS such as synaptic plasticity (Mendoza-Fer-
na
´ ndez et al., 2000), ingestive behavior (Plata-Salama
´ n, 1992),
and emotion (Schrott and Crnic, 1996). There is mounting evi-
dence that the functions of type I IFNs are associated with brain
effects in several clinical conditions such as familiar Aicardi-
Goutieres syndrome (Prinz and Knobeloch, 2012). In addition,
high frequencies of depression, anxiety, and memory loss in pa-
tients treated with high doses of type I IFNs have been reported
(Leuschen et al., 2004). However, the molecular basis for neuro-
modulatory actions, especially neuropsychiatric and cognitive
complications associated with systemic IFN treatment remains
enigmatic. In this study, we identified brain endothelial and
epithelial cells as a natural barrier of IFN-mediated sickness
behavior. The selective and non-redundant IFNAR1 engagement
on endothelial and epithelial cells, especially in the brain but
not in peripheral tissues, points to distinct spatial and temporal
effects of type I IFNs in the CNS. Although IFNAR1 on meninges
or ependymal cells were not targeted by Slco1c1CreERT2-deleter
mice, sickness behavior was absent in those mice, indicating
that brain endothelial and epithelial cells of the choroid
plexus are the main source of IFN-induced CXCL10 release.
Brain endothelia and epithelia have been shown to be an impor-
tant mediator of the immune-to-brain communication during
IL-1b-induced fever (Ridder et al., 2011).
Upon systemic application of recombinant IFN-a, one study
described direct effects on parenchymal CNS cells (e.g., neu-
rons and glia) by rapid induction of IFN-stimulated genes such
as STAT1 (Wang et al., 2008). However, in contrast to that report
we observed induction of the IFN-stimulated gene ISG15 in brain
endothelial and epithelial cells only and not in other CNS cells.
IFN-a and IFN-b might target different cell types in the CNS
and the periphery with a greater degree of unwanted side effects
in the case of IFNa. In addition, depletion of IFNAR1 on neuroec-
todermal cells including neurons and macroglia by using Ifnar1fl/fl
NesCre did not protect mice from type 1 IFN-induced sickness.
In contrast, only brain endothelial and epithelial- specific IFNAR1
deletion in Ifnar1fl/flSlco1c1-CreERT2 mice provided genetic evi-
dence for this tissue-specific IFNAR1 function. Myeloid specific
IFNAR1 deletion that is important for CNS inflammation (Prinz
et al., 2008) did not contribute to disease pathogenesis.
Our data on the effects of type I IFNs outside the CNS were
also supported by pharmacological studies that estimated that
only a small fraction (less than 0.2%) of peripherally-adminis-
tered IFNs gain access to the CNS (Billiau et al., 1981).
Previously described directs effects of type I IFNs on neurons
such as increased inhibitory postsynaptic effects on CA1 pyra-
midal cells leading to reduced long-term potentiation (Men-
doza-Ferna
´ ndez et al., 2000), inhibition of glutamate-induced
excitatory postsynaptic potentials of CA3 hippocampal neurons
on rodents (Mu
¨ ller et al., 1993), or on the development of neural
stem cells (Zheng et al., 2014), do not account for the effects we
observed after ssRNA virus infection or dsRNA ligand challenge.
In contrast, we identified the chemokines CXCL9, CXCL10,
and CXCL11 and their joint receptor CXCR3 as the essential
modulator of neuronal plasticity. In our electrophysiological ex-
periments we observed, in accordance with previous findings
(Vlkolinsky
´ et al., 2004), reduced paired-pulse facilitation and
impaired long-term potentiation in the CA1 region of the hippo-
campus in the presence of CXCL10 in vivo and in vitro. However,
our in vitro data showed a more pronounced inhibition of paired-
pulse facilitation with effects on all interstimulus intervals investi-
gated when compared to published data (Vlkolinsky
´ et al., 2004).
Impaired cognitive performance, in correlation with reduced
long-term potentiation and short-term plasticity (paired-pulse re-
sponses), has been described in depth previously (Lynch, 2004).
Paired-pulse responses, as seen in this study, are thought to
depend primarily on presynaptic mechanisms including neuro-
transmitter release (Zucker and Regehr, 2002). Hence, the reduc-
tion in paired-pulse facilitation after CXCL10 application pointed
to impaired neurotransmitter release, which could also underlie
the observed increase in depressive-like behavior. This hypothe-
sis is supported by recent data showing a causal link between the
reduction of hippocampal glutamatergic transmission and a
depressive-like phenotype in rodents (Marrocco et al., 2014)
and patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) (Kohli et al.,
2011). In support of our data, patients suffering from MDD
show increased peripheral protein concentrations of CXCL10,
which are assumed to be similarly elevated in the brain as serum
and CSF levels of chemokines appear to correlate (Wong et al.,
2008). When we analyzed CXCL10 after VSV-M2 infection,
elevated CXCL10 protein levels were not only detectedin the brain
but also in the spleen and serum. This finding might imply that
CXCL10 could also cross the BBB, enter the brain, and subse-
quently contribute to inhibit neuronal function. Although this pos-
sibility cannot be fully excluded, it seems unlikely because the
expression of tight junction genes was unaltered during all condi-
tions. Additional evidence was provided by our observation that
the BBB tightness, as verified by potential albumin leakage, was
not compromised by any treatment. There was also no detectable
recruitment of immune cells to the brain parenchyma after VSV-
M2 infection, which further indicates an intact BBB. Even if certain
910
Immunity 44, 901–912, April 19, 2016
 amounts of CXCL10 from the periphery should be able to pene-
trate the BBB, they could not be the main reason for the observed
behavioralchanges.Thisconclusionis based onthe factthatdele-
tion of IFNAR from brain endothelia and epithelia prevented IFN-b
or VSV-M2-induced sickness behavior. CXCL10 could either bind
directly to CXCR3 expressed on neurons, which directly inhibits
neuronal plasticity, or first act on microglial CXCR3, to modulate
neuronal function in a second step. In that case, microglia would
have to be activated as indicated by elevated expression of
major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII) (Benveniste
et al., 2001). However, we could not observe upregulation of
MHC class IIafteranyofthe different treatments.UponIFN-b chal-
lenge endothelial cells in vitro readily released CXCL10 into the
medium. But how was CXCL10 reaching its neuronal receptor
CXCR3 in situ? Simple diffusion is one explanation because re-
combinant CXCL10 directly applied to the bath or injected into
the mouse brain, elicited changes in synaptic plasticity.
In summary, our study provides evidence for the importance
of brain endothelial and epithelial cells in the communication
between the CNS and the immune system, and demonstrates
tissue specific IFNAR1 engagement during sickness behavior.
By the identification of the IFN-induced CXCL10/CXCR3 axis,
we offer new drug targets for the management of behavioral
impairment during virus infection and type I IFN therapy.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Mice
All animal experiments were approved by the Federal Ministry for Nature, Envi-
ronment and Consumers’ Protection of the states of Baden-Wu
¨ rttemberg
(35-9185.81/G12/71), Lower Saxony and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and
were carried out in accordance to the respective national, federal, and institu-
tional regulations. Male mice only were used for the experiments. Mice were
group housed up to five per cage with 12 hr light/dark cycle with lights on at
6:00 a.m. Food and water were available ad libitum. A detailed description
of mice and mouse treatment is given in the Supplemental Experimental
Procedures.
Behavioral Testing
The behavioral tests were conducted using male offspring aged 8 to 16 weeks.
Mice were first tested in the Morris water maze (MWM), followed 1 day later by
the forced swim test (FST). All the water maze and forced swim tests were run
between 1 and 5 p.m. (i.e., during the light cycle). In control experiments, an
additional cohort of mice was raised in the reversed 12:12 light/dark cycles
(lights on at 9:00 p.m.) and tested in the dark phase, under incandescent red
light illumination. Data obtained from the two cohorts were strikingly similar
(data not shown). Details for the MWM and FST can be found in the Supple-
mental Experimental Procedures.
Endothelial Cell Culture
Primary mouse brain endothelial cells (PBECs) were prepared from 2 to
6 months old genetically-modified mice that had been injected with tamoxifen
(TAM) at the age of 5 to 6 weeks of age as described previously (Ridder et al.,
2011). For details see Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Microarray
Transcriptional profiles of whole spleen tissues and brain endothelial cells
were assessed using Affymetrix� Mouse Gene 2.1 ST Array.
ELISA and ELISA Cytokine Assay
Culture media was collected at 7 and 24 hr after IFN-b treatment. The media
were immediately concentrated using centrifugal filters (Amicon Ultra, 3K,
Millipore) for 30 min at 14,000 g and then stored at �80�C until analysis. The
IFN-b levels in the culture media were measured using ELISA cytokine assay
kits (SABiosciences) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For
CXCL10 (R&D Systems) and High Sensitivity IFN-b ELISA (PBL Assay Science)
serum was collected and brain and spleen tissue was homogenized in 1 ml
buffer (20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.3 with 140 mM NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100 supple-
mented with Complete Mini protease inhibitor [Roche] and 2 mM sodium
orthovanadate) using Lysing Matrix D (brain) and A (spleen) in a FastPrep ho-
mogenator (MP Biomedical). Debris-free supernatant was used and ELISA
was performed according to manufacturer’s protocol.
VSV-M2 Plaque Assay
After infected tissues were removed at indicated time points and homogenized
in 1 ml of medium, serial 10-fold dilutions of homogenates were transferred
onto confluent Vero cell (ACC33, Leibniz Institute DSMZ, Germany) mono-
layers in six-well plates and incubated for 1 hr at 37�C. Monolayers were over-
laid with 2 ml of MEM containing 1% methylcellulose and incubated for 24 hr at
37�C. The overlay was then removed, and the monolayer was fixed and
stained using 0.5% crystal violet dissolved in 5% formaldehyde, 50% ethanol,
and 4.25% NaCl.
Flow Cytometry
To determine the depletion efficiency of aPDCA-1 antibody, we stained sple-
nocytes for CD3 (eBioscience), CD19 (Southern Biotech), CD11c (BD PharMin-
gen), and SiglecH (eBioscience). Cells were washed, fixed with 1% PFA, and
analyzed using a LSR II sorb (Becton Dickinson) flow cytometer. Data were ac-
quired with FACSdiva software (Becton Dickinson). Post-acquisition analysis
was carried out using FlowJo Software 7.9 (Tree Star).
qRT-PCR
RNA from PBECs and mouse spleen was isolated using the Arcturus Pico kit
(Applied Biosystems) or the RNeasy Mini kit (QIAGEN), respectively, according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. Samples were treated with DNase I (Roche)
and 200 ng (PBECs) or 1 mg (spleen) of RNA was transcribed into cDNA using
oligo(dT) primers and the SuperScript II RT kit (Invitrogen) or by using the high
capacity kit (Applied Biosystems). 1 ml cDNA was transferred into a 96-well
Multiply PCR plate (Sarstedt) with 11.5 ml ABsolute QPCR SYBR Green master
mix (Thermo Fisher). RT-PCR reactions were carried out as described previ-
ously (Dann et al., 2012). A list of primers is provided under Supplemental
Experimental Procedures.
Western Blot Analysis
PBECs cells were cultured in 6-well plates. Cells were stimulated with
500 U/mL of mouse IFN-b for the indicated times, lysed in 43 Laemmli buffer
containing 400 mM DTT, incubated at 90�C for 10 min, loaded on SDS-PAGE
gels, and immunoblotted using antibodies against Gapdh (1:1,000, Mab374,
Millipore) and pSTAT (1:1,000, 58D6, Cell Signaling).
