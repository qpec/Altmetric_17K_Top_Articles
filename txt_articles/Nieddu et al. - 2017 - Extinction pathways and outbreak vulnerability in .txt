A zoonotic disease is a disease that can be passed from animals to humans.
Zoonotic viruses may adapt to a human host eventually becoming endemic
in humans, but before doing so punctuated outbreaks of the zoonotic virus
may be observed. The Ebola virus disease (EVD) is an example of such a dis-
ease. The animal population in which the disease agent is able to reproduce in
sufficient number to be able to transmit to a susceptible human host is called a
reservoir. There is little work devoted to understanding stochastic population
dynamics in the presence of a reservoir, specifically the phenomena of disease
extinction and reintroduction. Here, we build a stochastic EVD model and
explicitly consider the impacts of an animal reservoir on the disease persist-
ence. Our modelling approach enables the analysis of invasion and fade-out
dynamics, including the efficacy of possible intervention strategies. We inves-
tigate outbreak vulnerability and the probability of local extinction and
quantify the effective basic reproduction number. We also consider the effects
of dynamic population size. Our results provide an improved understanding
of outbreak and extinction dynamics in zoonotic diseases, such as EVD.
1. Introduction
The Ebola virus disease (EVD) is an infectious zoonosis found in several mam-
mals, including humans, bats and apes. A zoonosis is a disease that can be
naturally transmitted from animals to humans. If there is a non-human disease
carrier, we call that species a disease reservoir. Strong evidence for an Ebola
virus reservoir can be seen in the invasion/extinction cycles that have taken
place over the 40 years of recorded EVD history in humans. The first known
spillover of EVD into the human population took place in Zaire (now the
Democratic Republic of the Congo) near the Ebola River from which the disease
took its name. Major EVD epidemics have taken place in the Democratic Repub-
lic of the Congo, Gabon, Sudan, Uganda, and most recently in Guinea, Sierra
Leone and Liberia. Although the disease was first recognized and has been pri-
marily located in Central Africa, the most recent epidemic has been taking place
along the continent’s western coast.
Unlike non-zoonotic diseases, EVD goes through long periods of global
extinction in the human population. These EVD-free periods are punctuated
by seemingly spontaneous disease reintroduction, which suggests infection
from a non-human source. Additionally, there is a large body of work in the
biological and ecological sciences providing evidence that the virus is main-
tained
in
animal
populations
[1,2].
Thus,
the
seemingly
spontaneous
reappearance of the disease in the human population must be understood in
the context of unpredictable interactions between humans and animal carriers
of the disease. Although they are random in nature, researchers are working
to improve our understanding of these interactions [3,4].
The EVD is transmitted via bodily fluids such as blood, saliva, semen and
breast milk, and is very deadly in both humans and apes, with an average

 mortality rate of 50% in humans. Depending on the viral strain,
the disease may kill as much as 90% of an affected human
population [5]. When the disease is transferred from the
animal reservoir into the human population it is known as a
spillover event. Although EVD has a relatively difficult time
invading and persisting in a human population, there have
been over half a dozen spillover events with more than 100
infected individuals since 1976, when the disease was initially
recognized in Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo).
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the
USA estimates over 28 000 infections and over 11 000 deaths
in the most recent West African epidemic [6]. As of March
2016, the epidemic is under control with small on-going flare-
ups that are likely to continue to occur for the immediate future.
From a modelling perspective, considering an estimated
disease incubation time of 7–21 days, a deterministic suscep-
tible–exposed–infectious–recovered
(SEIR)
compartmental
model is appropriate to investigate the dynamics [7–9]. Exten-
sions have been proposed to account for various kinds of
intervention [10] or, as in the case of gravity models, to
account for the spread of EVD over an explicit spatial region.
In a gravity model, the force of infection from a non-
contiguous population will be proportional to the size of the
respective populations, and inversely proportional to the
square of the distance between the two populations [11,12].
Studies that explicitly consider the dynamics of EVD
while in the presence of a zoonotic reservoir are less
common. Although the zoonotic reservoir for Ebola is still a
matter of contention among researchers, bats make for a
likely suspect [1,2]. It is known that non-human primates
are sometimes involved in the spread of EVD to humans as
intermediate susceptible hosts [3]. Accounting for human
exposure to the reservoir is paramount for the study of
disease
introduction.
However,
disease
extinction
and
reintroduction are rare stochastic events that cannot be
captured by deterministic models.
Therefore, the goal of this paper is to present a stochastic
model that explicitly accounts for both the introduction of
EVD from the zoonotic reservoir as well as the fade-out
periods. Perturbations of this work can be used to assess the
efficacy of disease control strategies such as vaccination and
quarantine. Additionally, the work supports the use of the
basic reproduction number while quantifying outbreak vulner-
ability in populations weakly coupled to a disease reservoir.
Although this paper focuses on EVD, the results are broadly
relevant to outbreak and extinction in zoonotic diseases.
2. Material and methods
In this paper, we extend a previously adopted compartmental
model for EVD with intervention [10] to a stochastic model
that captures the internal random dynamics of a population.
Figure 1 shows the division of the population into the following
six classes:
(1) Susceptible class S consists of individuals who may become
infected with EVD through contact with an infectious indi-
vidual,
a
hospitalized
individual,
or
a
deceased
but
unburied individual.
(2) Exposed class E consists of individuals who are infected with
EVD but are not yet infectious.
(3) Infectious class I consists of individuals who are capable of
transmitting EVD to a susceptible individual.
(4) Recovered class R consists of individuals who have recovered
from EVD.
(5) Deceased class D consists of deceased and unburied individ-
uals who are capable of transmitting EVD to a susceptible
individual.
(6) Hospitalized class H consists of individuals who have been
hospitalized and are capable of transmitting EVD to a sus-
ceptible
individual.
In
our
model,
we
assume
that
individuals who die while in the hospitalized class are
immediately buried.
Figure 1 also shows the interactions among these population
classes. Note that EVD transmission can occur through both
infectious human contact and the animal reservoir. We assume
that contact with the animal reservoir is always possible, and
independent of the ratio of animal carriers to humans.
The model we study is an extension of an SEIR model.
Besides explicit consideration of the reservoir, the model includes
two additional classes: hospitalized and deceased. We note that

 this model (without a reservoir) has been used in previous
studies [9,10]. The hospitalized and deceased compartments
account for important routes of disease transmission which are
specific to EVD. Additionally, these routes provide a way to
investigate the usefulness of practical intervention through
the rate of hospitalization and fast access to a safe burial.
The effectiveness of practical intervention strategies can be
monitored through these parameters, together with variations
in contact rates.
The model captures movement between the classes as sto-
chastic transitions that occur at specified transition rates. Each
of these transitions represents a random event that can occur in
a population. Table 1 quantifies the possible transition events
and associated rates, which follow the figure 1 flow diagram.
In the master equation approach to stochastic modelling, these
transition rates are used as coefficients that define the probability
of each respective transition event [13,14]. Assuming some dis-
crete
period
of
time
during
which
exactly
one
of
the
aforementioned events takes place, the probability that a particu-
lar event will be the one that does take place is equal to its own
transition rate divided by the sum of all transition rates. The sto-
chastic simulations reported on in this paper use these transitions
in a Monte Carlo algorithm as described in [15].
The parameter values we use for EVD are given in table 2. With
the exception of k, the parameters are as reported in [10]. The value
of k definesthe probabilityof an infection from the animal reservoir.
The approximate range for k can be calculated by dividing the
number of outbreak events by the time over which those outbreaks
took place and then dividing by the population size. This gives an
approximate range for k between 1029 and 1026.
In both the earlier and the more recent EVD outbreaks in
Africa, the virus has been reported to have relatively low infec-
tivity [8,16]. A common metric for infectivity of a disease is the
basic reproduction number, R0, which is defined as the average
number of infections that a single infectious individual will trig-
ger in a fully susceptible population. R0 can be described more
roughly as the ratio between the inflow of infected individuals
and the outflow of dead or recovered individuals in a fully sus-
ceptible population. If the inflow is greater than the outflow, then
R0 . 1, and the disease will spread. If the outflow is greater than
the inflow, then R0 , 1, and the disease will go extinct. For con-
text, the reproductive number for measles may be as high as
R0 ¼ 18 and the reproductive number for influenza is R0 � 4.
The reproductive number for EVD is estimated to be approxi-
mately R0 � 2 [8,16]. The parameters in table 2 agree with this
estimation.
If the transitions between states are short and uncorrelated
and we assume the population is well mixed, the system is a
Markov process and the evolution of the probability is described
by a master equation [13,14]. We assume that the population is
large and the WKB (Wentzel–Kramers–Brillouin) approximation
for the probability distribution in the scaled master equation can
be used [17–21]. By performing a Taylor series expansion on this
equation, one arrives at the leading-order Hamilton–Jacobi
equation for which the stochastic dynamics are captured in
the conjugate momentum variables. This statistical mechanics
approach to the problem naturally leads to the associated Ham-
iltonian and Hamilton’s equations, which doubles the dimension
of the problem but recasts it as a deterministic system of non-
linear differential equations that is useful to analyse the
dynamics of the original stochastic system [22–24]. The master
equation and Hamiltonian for the stochastic EVD model are
provided in appendix A.
The standard approach to analysing the dynamics of a sto-
chastic system such as this is to start with the mean-field
equations (provided in appendix B). This is done by assuming
a value of zero for the conjugate momentum variables in Hamil-
ton’s equations. This reduced system captures the deterministic
dynamics, which is the limit of the stochastic dynamics in the
large population limit. Full analysis of the mean-field equations
for the EVD model reveals dynamics similar to lower dimen-
sional SEIR systems in the literature [7]. Two steady states of
the mean-field equations can be derived analytically. If we
assume no reservoir transmission (k ¼ 0), the first steady state
can be described as the disease-free equilibrium (DFE), for
which the entire population is susceptible and no infection is pre-
sent. This state is stable if the basic reproduction number satisfies
R0 , 1, implying that the disease cannot persist in the population
and all solutions will limit to the DFE. If R0 . 1, the DFE is
unstable and the disease will persist. In other words, if EVD is
introduced into a system having R0 . 1, solutions will tend to
an endemic steady state, implying non-zero values for the
infected and infectious classes.

 By introducing reservoir transmission (k . 0), the traditional
DFE no longer exists as a small number of exposed individuals
are introduced to the system. Therefore, in addition to the tra-
ditional endemic state, there is another steady state that we call
the invasion state that has a small number of non-susceptible
individuals. While this deterministic system cannot exhibit
periods of disease fade-out and re-invasion, its steady states pro-
vide guidance in understanding the dynamics of the full
stochastic system. The existence of the invasion state depends
on the force of infection from the animal reservoir, and we will
see that it plays an important role in outbreak vulnerability.
Another advantage of analysing the mean-field equations is
the ability to approximate the basic reproduction number.
Using the next-generation matrix as described in [25] and
assuming no reservoir transmission (k ¼ 0), we use the DFE to
analytically determine

which quantifies whether EVD can persist in the population. The
derivation for the basic reproduction number is provided in
appendix C. Because the reservoir transmission is small, this
quantity provides a good approximation of the ability for the dis-
ease to persist when randomly introduced. Intervention methods
can also be evaluated by how they decrease this value, with an
aim of R0 , 1.
3. Results
Real-world data for EVD suggest that the basic reproduction
rate is greater than one, but the disease dynamics cannot be
captured by deterministic models with solutions that simply
limit to a steady state. The stochastic EVD model allows behav-
iour beyond the dynamics predicted by the mean-field
equations. Examples include solutions that switch steady
states, resembling disease outbreak (invasion) and fade-out
(extinction) events. In particular, we are interested in the
effect of a transmission reservoir in these dynamics.
3.1. Invasion
We begin by discussing outbreak vulnerability in the stochas-
tic EVD model, which describes the invasion dynamics after
an infected individual is introduced into a population having
few or no infections. The random introduction would occur
through the transmission reservoir, quantified by the par-
ameter k. While the larger infrequent outbreaks would
result in an under-prepared and overwhelmed healthcare
system, the impact of long, sustained outbreaks would be
more taxing on a population. Assessing the outbreak vulner-
ability of a specific population and the effectiveness of
possible intervention strategies would help prepare health-
care workers and possibly prevent a breakdown of the
system during an outbreak.
Representative time series for several reservoir trans-
mission rates using EVD parameters are presented in the
inlay of figure 2. If there is very low transmission from the
reservoir and most of the population is susceptible, the sol-
ution will exhibit large outbreaks, or spillover events,
spread out in time so that there are long disease-free periods.
This behaviour is represented by the green time series in the
inlay of figure 2. If the transmission rate from the reservoir is
high, then the solution oscillates about a non-zero steady
state and there are few if any disease-free periods. This be-
haviour is represented by the red time series in the inlay of
figure 2. The colour bar at the bottom of figure 2 shows the
values for k exhibiting these dynamics and how a combi-
nation of these two green and red extremes is exhibited by
solutions for transmission rates in between. The orange
time series in the inlay is presented as a representative
example.
We measure the outbreak vulnerability of the system by
finding the average proportion of disease-free time during a
sample of 1000 stochastic simulations. Details regarding the
numerical simulations can be found in appendix D. The
results for EVD parameters as we vary k are presented in
figure 2. For populations with very weak connection to the
disease reservoir (small k), almost all of the time is spent dis-
ease free. As k increases, the disease-free time decreases at a
nearly exponential rate. We describe the periods of disease-
free time as disease fade-out and the decrease of fade-out is
associated with sustained outbreaks.
Both the contact rate with infected individuals (bi) and
the EVD burial rate (d) are important factors for a popu-
lation’s outbreak vulnerability and can change over the
course of an outbreak, as they relate to human behavioural
considerations that are likely to be affected by the spread of
information. One would assume that increasing d and
decreasing bi would be salient and practical strategies to
reduce outbreak vulnerability. The stochastic EVD model
can provide an estimate of how the outbreak vulnerability
changes with these prevention measures, allowing for the
assessment
of
how
to
achieve
the
maximum
impact.
Figure 3 is a graph of the average proportion of disease-free
time in simulations of the EVD model as bi and d are
varied. These simulations follow the methodology described
for figure 2. As expected, low values for the contact rate and
high values for the burial rate have the most disease-free time
and least outbreak vulnerability. Overlaid as a dashed black
curve is R0 ¼ 1 for the mean-field EVD model without reser-
voir transmission, as described in equation (2.1). This curve is
the boundary between the basins for which the DFE and the
endemic steady states are stable in the mean-field EVD

 model. When R0 , 1, the DFE is stable for low values for the
contact rate and high values for the burial rate. We propose to
use the R0 ¼ 1 curve to approximate the boundary between
low and high outbreak vulnerability in the stochastic EVD
model with reservoir transmission. Therefore, it indicates
intervention strategies that target bi and d parameter values
for R0 , 1 (below the dashed line) which would have the
greatest benefit for the population.
3.2. Extinction
We continue with a discussion of how the stochastic EVD
model can exhibit periods of disease absence, or fade-out,
despite the fact that the basic reproduction rate is greater
than one. As we have noted in the previous section, outbreaks
can be quick and infrequent or sustained and frequent,
depending on outbreak vulnerability. This distinction describes
the two mechanisms that allow for a solution to reach a
disease-free state, which we consider an extinction event.
When the outbreak vulnerability is low, there are long dis-
ease-free
periods
in
which
the
susceptible
population
replenishes itself as the recovered individuals are naturally
removed. The small transmission rate from the reservoir has
a low probability of causing an outbreak, and finally, when
it happens, the susceptible compartment is the majority of
the population and the disease quickly spreads through the
group. Here, the mean-field model provides general insight
for the underlying dynamics exhibited by the stochastic
model. The stable endemic state (assuming R0 . 1) is a spiral
sink and solutions spiral in towards it in an anticlockwise
fashion when projected on the susceptible–infectious plane.
The initial conditions for the invasion are far from the endemic
state, which is stable but not strongly attracting (1 , R0 , 2).
Therefore, the solution will orbit the endemic state in a large
anticlockwise path (at a significant distance from the endemic
state), quickly reaching a disease-free state on the other side of
the orbit. The solution will remain disease free as the suscep-
tible population rebuilds and repeats the cycle. These
outbreaks are random, but, as shown in figure 3, the average
behaviour follows a continuous measure of disease-free time
that depends on the system parameters. It is worth mentioning
that the invasion steady state is small and does not seem to
play a significant role in these dynamics.
For large outbreak vulnerability, the invasion is a solution
that escapes the disease-free state and causes a large disease
outbreak. In this case, the solution is similar to what one
would expect from the deterministic mean-field equations.
What is unique about stochastic systems is that the small
random fluctuations allow escape from steady states, and in
simulations this will happen in finite time (although the time
may be exponentially long). To understand the mechanism
of escape, one can use Hamilton’s equations to identify the
quasi-stable steady states in the stochastic system, as well as
action-minimizing curves that provide a path from one
steady state to another. An action-minimizing curve identifies
the path that is probabilistically most likely to be taken during
a switching event. This trajectory is thus known as the optimal
path [19,23,26,27]. For the EVD model, the optimal path to
extinction is a curve in 12-dimensional space that connects
the endemic state to the invasion state.
Noting that k is much smaller than the other parameters in
table 2, solutions for the stochastic EVD model near the endemic
state can be approximated by assuming k ¼ 0. The exception is
during invasion events, when the reservoir brings the disease
back from extinction. Therefore, we set k ¼ 0 in an illustra-
tive example for computing the optimal path to extinction
and comparing it with extinction dynamics in simulations.
For this high-dimensional model, an analytic solution is
not tractable and we use numerical methods to approximate
the optimal path. We use the iterative action minimizing
method (IAMM) [28] to find 2400 points approximating the
12-dimensional optimal path of the stochastic EVD model,
with a maximum error of 2.4487 � 10210. Details regarding
the
numerical
simulations
can
be
found
in
appendix
E. Figure 4 shows the resulting solution, starting at the ende-
mic state and spiralling out to the disease-free state. We verify
our result by comparing it with the probability density of
extinction prehistory in the susceptible–infectious plane.
The probability density was numerically computed using
10 000 simulations that ended in spontaneous extinction
(details in appendix D). Starting at the extinction point, the

 previous positions in state space for each trajectory are
binned and the frequency is plotted in the susceptible–
infectious plane in figure 4. The highest frequency regions
are shown in red in the density plot, and the optimal path
is overlaid. Figure 4 shows that, among all the paths the sto-
chastic system can take to reach the extinct state, there is one
path that has the highest probability of occurring. This opti-
mal path of extinction lies on the peak of the probability
density of the extinction prehistory.
Additional verification of the optimal path to extinction is
achieved by projecting the 12-dimensional optimal path onto
the lower-dimensional stochastic centre manifold shown in
figure 5. Since the stochastic EVD model is an SEIR-type
model, it is straightforward to compute the stochastic centre
manifold from the mean-field equations using techniques
developed in [29,30]. The stochastic centre manifold is the sur-
face on which the long-term dynamics of the stochastic system
will fall. Therefore, it follows that the approximation of the
optimal path should lie on this hyperplane. The entire set of
optimal path data and the centre manifold equation for the
stochastic EVD model are provided in appendix E.
Knowledge of the optimal path is also useful, because it
allows one to find the average time to travel from the endemic
state to the extinct state. We call this time the mean time to dis-
ease extinction (MTE). Since the optimal path can be used to
estimate the MTE it is useful for quantifying the efficacy of dis-
ease control such as vaccine and quarantine. In particular, an
effective disease control programme will shift the optimal
path in a way that decreases the MTE. Although this was not
computed for the stochastic EVD model, it is straightforward
both to track the extinction time during a simulation as well
as to compute an expected mean value based on the optimal
path. This will be a topic of future study.
For outbreak vulnerability parameters in between the two
extremes, the system may exhibit a combination of quick and
sustained outbreaks, sometimes using the optimal path to
escape from the endemic state. The MTE may provide insight
to the frequency of disease-free periods and may also provide
a measure of intervention effectiveness.
3.3. Dynamic population size
Currently, we account for births and deaths in such a way
that it is assumed that the stochastic EVD model retains a
mean population size. While population growth rates in
many African regions have declined steadily over time,
the overall growth in Africa remains a net positive, with
the population of many countries expected to double by the
year 2050 [31,32]. When the birth rate is greater than the
death rate, the total population will change in time. If we
allow for a dynamic population size in the model, then
both the endemic state and the basic reproduction rate
become dynamic. Higher birth rates increase the flow of sus-
ceptible individuals into the population, which increases the
probability of stochastic reintroduction and the force of
infection. Consequently, the likelihood of stochastic fade-
out decreases and the system is bound to transition to a
dynamic endemic state. This implies that, even for the subcri-
tical initial dynamic condition R0 , 1, a transition to endemic
disease circulation is likely. Moreover, it is dependent on
various measures including both k and birth rate. This
condition, when realized, may limit the impact of interven-
tion. We reserve the discussion of the linkage among these
effects to another publication. By maintaining the natural
death rate for all compartments at the value given in table
2, and increasing the birth rate to m ¼ 9.5 � 1025, one can
compute stochastic realizations of this dynamic process.
Details regarding the numerical simulations can be found
in appendix D. An example is shown in figure 6, where one
can see that there is a fundamental change in behaviour.
Initially, the population is relatively small and invasion
events are infrequent, as shown by the red curve. Later in
time, the inflow of susceptibles causes a shift to a persistent
but increasing endemic state. Outbreak vulnerability has
increased with population size, transitioning from infrequent
to sustained outbreaks.
4. Conclusion
The recent West African epidemic of EVD was a catastrophe
that resulted in a devastating loss of life. With its frighten-
ingly low survival rate, along with our apparent inability to
predict the disease introduction and trajectory, EVD poses a

Figure 6. A growing population increases outbreak vulnerability and allows
for sustained outbreaks. We show a sample time series with increasing popu-
lation size (birth rate m ¼ 9.5 � 1025 and k ¼ 1.8 � 1029), and a
starting population of N ¼ 106. The susceptible population has been
scaled by a factor of 1000 so that both the infectious and susceptible
time series can be clearly seen in the figure. Initially, the reservoir trans-
mission triggers large outbreaks and results in fast extinction events. As
the size of the population and the number of susceptible individuals
increases, infectious individuals tend to a dynamic endemic state with
sustained outbreaks. All other parameters are as in table 2.

 continuing threat. For any such zoonosis disease, prevention
prior to introduction is as important as disease control during
an outbreak, and so the disease must be taken as seriously
during its latent period as it is during an active period. In
this paper, we contend that EVD should be considered in a
stochastic framework and not as an entirely predictable deter-
ministic process. The study of zoonotic diseases benefits
particularly
from
the
application
of
stochastic
modell-
ing methods because of the unpredictable nature of the
human-to-reservoir interactions.
The optimal path to disease extinction is a minimal
action trajectory between an endemic and extinct state. This
path is the most likely route to disease extinction in the
presence of noise. The optimal path can therefore be used
to estimate the mean time to disease extinction, and as
a result may be used to quantitatively assess disease
control measures.
When a disease intervention strategy is adopted, it will
affect the optimal path and the expected time to disease
extinction. To determine an optimal intervention strategy,
one must quantitatively compare different possible control
methods. Control through an investigation of the optimal
path has been successfully adopted in biochemical network
dynamics [33]. The mean time to extinction, as determined
through the optimal path, is the quantitative metric that
should be used to determine the efficacy of a control
method. In particular, studying the relationship between
the optimal path and disease intervention may allow for
the optimal allocation of resources prior to or during an epi-
demic. For example, Khasin et al. [34] identified the resonant
effect of vaccination pulses in an SIR model and derived an
optimal vaccination protocol that can speed up extinction
when the vaccine is in short supply. Billings et al. [35] con-
sidered the effect of treatment for the SIS model, and
showed an exponential decrease in disease extinction times.
In the case of the EVD model considered in this paper,
the optimal path is a curve through 12-dimensional space,
and is found by solving a 12-dimensional system of differen-
tial equations. Knowledge of the optimal path to extinction
allows one to perturb our model to determine relative sensi-
tivity to changes in human behaviour and to disease control
strategies. With these tools, one could predict the relative
effectiveness of disease control measures. Given appro-
priate cost functions for the implementation of the different
control measures, one could minimize the mean time to
extinction given a finite set of resources, thus developing an
optimal strategy.
Once disease extinction has been achieved, then the Ebola
virus will only be found in non-human populations and an
understanding of the conditions for which invasion and
outbreak are most likely can help us to identify at-risk
populations. It can be seen using stochastic simulation tech-
niques that there are populations where long-lived endemic
states are very unlikely. This means that the disease may
invade consistently, but is always driven down to extinction in
a relatively short amount of time. Human behaviour as well as
the attributes of the disease can affect the vulnerability of a
population to outbreak. One way to quantify this risk is by
using the basic reproduction number from the associated deter-
ministic system. We have also observed that in a dynamic
population size model, where the birth rate is larger than the
death rate, the ability of the disease to invade into a population
is dependent on the size of the population.
Figure 3 shows that the basic reproduction number from the
deterministic system can be used as an indicator for stochastic
outbreak vulnerability. This fact allows one to extend important
conclusions from the investigation of deterministic systems to
more realistic stochastic systems. We show the intuitive con-
clusion that increasing the burial rate and decreasing the
contact rate will, ultimately, result in controlling the disease.
The frequencies that are reported in figure 3 show how the pres-
ence of the reservoir impacts the probability of controlling the
outbreak through standard intervention methods (self- or
forced isolation and safe removal of infected bodies), while
also affording information about which parameter may be
more appropriate to modify in order to decrease the impact of
the disease. It is worth noting that, in figure 3, the darker
orange coloration in the region of medium contact rates and
high burial rates is not a consequence of the model, but is
rather due to the population size and number of stochastic
realizations. An increase in either decreases the variance and
results in a smoother, more even coloration.
Since the size of the endemic state scales proportionally
with the size of the total population, larger populations
tend to be more susceptible to a long-lived endemic state
than smaller populations. Consider the number of infectious
individuals at the endemic state as given in appendix B. As
N increases, I increases proportionately. The deterministic
system can never escape from the stable endemic state,
regardless of how large or small the endemic state is. In the
stochastic formulation, however, the endemic state becomes
quasi-stable. This means that the natural variance of the sto-
chastic system can force a transition between the endemic and
extinct states. This favourable transition is less and less likely
to happen as the population size increases. In fact, the mean
time to stochastic extinction as a function of population size is
known to be exponential. Therefore, larger populations are
more likely to have a persistent disease after an invasion
event than are smaller populations. Figure 6 shows that, as
the population size increases over time, the risk for an ende-
mic disease state increases as well. This suggests that the risk
for disease invasion is particularly dynamic in developing
areas. Population growth is expected to continue for decades
in the developing world. The population of many African
countries is predicted to double by 2050 [31,32]. Figure 6
shows that even a population with an endemic state small
enough so that it will not be realized, but with a growing
population, may overcome a threshold and suddenly display
an endemic disease state after a long period of popula-
tion growth. Although it is not explicitly investigated here,
we hypothesize that a similar effect may be seen in an
increasingly
interconnected
and
globalized
region.
In
theory, the phenomenon requires population growth, not
necessarily from an imbalance between the birth and death
rates. In the future, similar work should be done on a grid
of interconnected populations, and in this way both spatial
spread,
which
is
not
considered
here,
and
increased
interconnectedness among populations can be investigated.

We evaluate the Jacobian matrices of F and V at the DFE,

as the next-generation matrix. Note that this expression cap-
tures the ratio between the inflow and an outflow from the

Appendix D. Numerical simulations
Large collections of stochastic realizations, known as stochas-
tic ensembles, were used to create figures 2–4. Each
individual stochastic realization represents a possible disease
trajectory and is produced using a type of Monte Carlo
method [15]. The algorithm uses a random number generator
to determine which event will occur as well as the time of
occurrence. During each random time step exactly one
event occurs. The probability of any particular event taking
place is equal to its own transition rate divided by the sum
of all transition rates. In the case of figure 6, the Spatiotem-
poral Epidemiological Modeler (STEM) was used. Different
from all of the other simulations where the natural birth
rate (m) was equal to the natural death rate (m), the creation
of figure 6 involved setting the birth rate higher than the
death rate so that mbirth . mdeath. This is the mechanism that
allows for an increasing population. Details of the numerical
code can be found at http://wiki.eclipse.org/Ebola_Models.
The deterministic mean-fieldformulation of the EVD system
given by equations (B 2) is solved using the Matlab Runge–
Kutta solver ode45. Note that equations (B 2) are written in
terms of the scaled variables ðxS, xE, xI, xD, xH, xRÞ. The scaled
variables are the original variables (S,E,I,D,H,R) scaled by the
average population size N. For the parameters given in table
2, the steady-state solutions are quite small. In particular, the
endemic state of ðxS, xE, xI, xD, xH, xRÞ � ð0:543, 2:228 � 10�4,

Figure 7. The parameters are given in table 2, with the exception of k ¼ 0. Each set of 2400 blue points represent the numerical approximation of the optimal
path to extinction found by the IAMM. The maximum error for this set is 2.4487 � 10210. The red star represents the location of the endemic state (left starting
point) and the green star represents the location of the extinct state (right-end point). (Online version in colour.)

 [28], a numerical scheme based on Newton’s method. The
IAMM is useful in the general situation where a path connect-
ing steady states Ca and Cb starts at Ca at t ¼ �1 and ends at
Cb
at
t ¼ þ1.
A
time
parameter
t
exists
such
that
�1 < t < 1. For this method, we require a numerical
approximation of the time needed to leave the region of Ca
and arrive in the region of Cb. Therefore, we define a time
Te
such
that
�1 < �Te < t < Te < 1.
Additionally,
Cð�TeÞ � Ca and CðTeÞ � Cb. In other words, the solution
stays very near the equilibrium Ca for �1 < t � �Te, has a
transition region from �Te < t < Te, and then stays near Cb
for Te < t < þ1. The interval ½�Te, Te� is discretized into n
segments using a uniform step size h ¼ ð2TeÞ=n or a suitable
non-uniform step size hk. The corresponding time series is
tkþ1 ¼ tk þ hk.
The derivative of the function value qk is approximated
using central finite differences by the operator dh given as
d
dt qk � dhqk ; h2
k�1qkþ1 þ ðh2

k�1Þqk � h2

k ¼ 0, . . . ,n:

Clearly, if a uniform step size is chosen, then equation (E 1)
simplifies to the familiar form given as
d
dt qk � dhqk ; qkþ1 � qk�1
2h
,
k ¼ 0, . . . ,n:
ðE 2Þ
Thus, one can develop the system of nonlinear algebraic
equations

and
dhpk þ @Hðxk,pkÞ
@x

k ¼ 0, . . . ,n,
ðE 3Þ
which is solved using a general Newton’s method. We let
qjðx,pÞ ¼ fx1,j . . . xn,j, p1,j . . . pn,jgT
ðE 4Þ
be an extended vector of 2nN components that contains the
jth Newton iterate, where N is the number of populations.
When j ¼ 0, q0ðx, pÞ provides the initial ‘guess’ as to the
location of the path that connects Ca and Cb. Given the jth
Newton iterate qj, the new qjþ1 iterate is found by solving
the linear system
q jþ1 ¼ qj �
FðqjÞ
JðqjÞ ,
ðE 5Þ
where F is the function defined by equation (E 3) acting on qj,
and J is the Jacobian. Equation (E 5) is solved using lower
upper (LU) decomposition with partial pivoting.
Because the endemic state of the mean field for the
parameters in table 2 is a spiral sink, one must use a con-
tinuation method to find the optimal path. This is done by
picking a large value of m that results in an R0 close to
but larger than one, which decreases the frequency of
the oscillations about the endemic state. Therefore, the
optimal path can be found using an initial condition of
a
straight
line
connecting
the
endpoints.
By
slowly
decreasing the value of m and using the previous optimal
path as the initial condition, one can repeat the process to
find the optimal path at the desired parameter values.
In figure 7, we present the entire set of data for the
optimal
extinction
path
for
a
stochastic
EVD
system
shown in figure 4.
Additional verification of our numerically computed opti-
mal path is achieved by projecting the 12-dimensional
optimal path onto the lower dimensional stochastic centre
manifold shown in figure 5. Since the EVD model is an
SEIR-type model, it is straightforward to compute the
stochastic centre manifold using techniques developed in
[29,30]. The stochastic centre manifold is characterized by
the dimensionally reduced equation
