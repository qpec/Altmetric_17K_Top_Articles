abstract
OBJECTIVE: We evaluated fiber intake during adolescence and early adulthood in relation to 
breast cancer (BC) risk in the Nurses’ Health Study II.
METHODS: Among 90 534 premenopausal women who completed a dietary questionnaire in 
1991, we documented 2833 invasive BC cases during 20 years of follow-up. In 1998, 44 263 
of these women also completed a questionnaire about their diet during high school; among 
these women, we documented 1118 cases of BC by end of follow-up. Multivariable-adjusted 
Cox proportional hazards regression was used to model relative risks (RRs) and 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs) for BC across categories of dietary fiber.
RESULTS: Among all women, early adulthood total dietary fiber intake was associated with 
significantly lower BC risk (RR for highest versus lowest quintile 0.81; 95% CI 0.72–0.91; 
Ptrend = .002). Higher intakes of soluble fiber (RR for highest versus lowest quintile 0.86; 
95% CI 0.77–0.97; Ptrend = .02) and insoluble fiber (RR for highest versus lowest quintile 
0.80; 95% CI 0.71–0.90; Ptrend < .001) were each associated with lower BC risk. Total dietary 
fiber intake in adolescence was also associated with lower BC risk (RR for highest versus 
lowest quintile 0.84; 95% CI 0.70–1.01; Ptrend = .04). For the average of fiber intake during 
adolescence and early adult life, the RR comparing highest with lowest quintiles was 0.75 
(95% CI 0.62–0.91, Ptrend = .004).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the hypothesis that higher fiber intakes reduce BC risk and 
suggest that intake during adolescence and early adulthood may be particularly important.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Previous studies 
of fi
 ber intake and breast cancer (BC) have almost 
all been nonsignifi
 cant, but none of them examined 
diet during adolescence or early adulthood, a period 
when BC risk factors appear to be particularly 
important.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: This study adds to the few 
potentially modifi
 able risk factors for BC. Higher 
fi
 ber intake was associated with lower BC risk and 
suggests that intake during adolescence and early 
adulthood may be particularly important.

Sex steroid hormone levels are 
strongly related to breast cancer 
(BC) development,1,2 and a diet high 
in fiber has been hypothesized to 
reduce BC incidence by inhibiting 
reabsorption of estrogen, thus 
decreasing circulating levels.3–5 
In most prospective studies,6–22 
including the Nurses’ Health Study,23 
no significant associations have 
been seen between fiber intake and 
BC risk. In a recent meta-analysis 
of 16 prospective studies, a weak 
inverse association was found; for an 
increment of 10 g fiber per day, a 5% 
lower BC risk was seen.24 Notably, 
most previous evidence on fiber 
intake and BC has been from studies 
in which women were enrolled 
during midlife or later; the effects 
of fiber during adolescence or early 
adulthood on BC incidence have 
been minimally studied. The atomic 
bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki 
and radiation treatment of Hodgkin’s 
lymphoma indicate that breast tissue 
may be particularly susceptible 
to carcinogenic exposures during 
childhood and early adult life.25–27 
Furthermore, in the Nurses’ Health 
Study II (NHSII) cohort, fiber intake 
during adolescence was inversely 
associated with proliferative benign 
breast disease (BBD), which is 
thought to reflect an early step in 
breast carcinogenesis. Women in 
the highest quintile of fiber intake 
had a 25% lower proliferative BBD 
risk than women in the lowest 
quintile,28 suggesting the importance 
of investigating dietary factors during 
this period of life.
In a previous analysis of NHSII,29,30 
fiber intakes during adolescence 
or early adulthood were not 
significantly associated with 
premenopausal BC risk. Updating 
these analyses with longer follow-up 
and a substantially larger number of 
cases, we were able to examine fiber 
intakes during adolescence and early 
adulthood in relation to BC diagnosed 
before and after menopause. In 
addition, we investigated the 
associations between fiber intake and 
BC by hormone receptor status.
METHODS
Study Population
The NHSII is an ongoing prospective 
cohort study of 116 430 female 
registered nurses aged 25 to 42 
years at enrollment in 1989. For this 
analysis, follow-up began in 1991 
when diet was first measured. From 
the 97 813 women who returned the 
1991 food frequency questionnaire 
(FFQ), we excluded women who had 
an implausible total energy intake 
(<600 or >3500 kcal/day); were 
postmenopausal in 1991; or had 
reported a previous diagnosis of 
cancer (except nonmelanoma skin 
cancer) before returning the 1991 
questionnaire. After exclusions, data 
from 90 534 women were available 
for the early adulthood fiber intake 
analysis.
In 1997, participants were asked 
about their willingness to complete a 
supplemental FFQ about diet during 
high school (HS-FFQ). Of the 64 380 
women (55% of the entire cohort) 
who indicated willingness to do so, 
47 355 returned the questionnaire 
in 1998.They were 33 to 52 years 
of age at that time (1997-99). There 
were minimal differences in baseline 
demographic characteristics and 
BC rates between participants who 
completed the HS-FFQ and women 
who did not provide information on 
high school diet.29
After excluding women who had any 
cancer except nonmelanoma skin 
cancer before 1998 or who reported 
implausible daily caloric intake 
during adolescence (<600 or ≥5000 
kcal), 44 263 women were available 
for the adolescent fiber intake 
analysis.
This study was approved by the 
Human Subjects Committee at 
Brigham and Women’s Hospital and 
Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public 
Health (Boston, Massachusetts).
Dietary Assessment
Dietary intake was obtained from 
NHSII participants via validated 
semiquantitative FFQ with ∼130 
items about usual dietary intake 
and alcohol consumption during 
the past year (available at http:// 
www. 
channing. 
harvard. 
edu/ 
nhs/? 
page_ 
id= 
246) in 1991 and every 
4 years thereafter. Validity of the 
questionnaire to assess long-term 
intake was assessed by comparison 
with weighed diet records collected 
3 to 4 years earlier; the correlation 
for dietary fiber intake, adjusted 
for energy intake, was 0.56.31 It is 
modest to good correlation, although 
it does cause attenuation of an 
association. The impact of this degree 
of measurement error is shown 
by the change in relative risk (RR) 
when we corrected for measurement 
error. Also, fiber intake assessed 
by this questionnaire has robustly 
predicted lower risks of coronary 
heart disease,32 type 2 diabetes,33 
and constipation.34
Food intakes during adolescence 
were evaluated using a 
semiquantitative 124-item HS-FFQ 
that included food items typically 
consumed between 1960 and 1980 
when the participants were in high 
school. Frequency of consumption 
was classified into 9 categories 
ranging from “never or less than 
once per month” to “6 or more per 
day.” The validity of the HS-FFQ was 
evaluated among 80 young women 
by comparing their responses to 
HS-FFQ with three 24-hour recalls 10 
years apart; the mean of corrected 
correlation coefficients for energy-
adjusted nutrient intakes was 0.45 
(range 0.16–0.68).35
Nutrient values in foods were 
obtained from the US Department of 
Agriculture, food manufacturers, and 
independent academic sources.36–38 
The food composition database was 
updated every 4 years to account 
for changes in the food supply. 
Fiber intakes were energy-adjusted 
by using the residuals from the

regression of nutrient intake on total 
energy intake.39
Documentation of BC
Biennial NHSII questionnaires were 
used to identify newly diagnosed 
invasive BC. Deaths in this cohort 
were reported through family 
members and the postal service 
in response to the follow-up 
questionnaires or identified through 
annual review of the National 
Death Index. When a case of BC was 
identified, we asked the participant 
(or next of kin for those who had 
died) for diagnosis confirmation and 
for permission to obtain relevant 
hospital records and pathology 
reports. Pathology reports confirmed 
99% of the self-reported diagnoses 
of BC. Because the degree of self-
reporting accuracy was high, 
diagnoses confirmed by participants 
with missing medical record 
information (n = 344) were included 
in the analysis. Information on 
estrogen and progesterone receptor 
(ER and PR) status of the BC was 
obtained from pathology reports.
Assessment of Other Variables
Data on potential risk factors 
for BC were obtained from the 
biennial NHSII questionnaires 
and updated to the most recent 
information before date of diagnosis, 
if available. Data on BMI at age 18 
and alcohol consumption during 
adolescence were obtained from 
the 1989 questionnaire. Weight 
change from age 18 was calculated 
by taking the difference between 
current weight and recalled 
weight at age 18. Women missing 
menopausal status were considered 
premenopausal if they were <46 
(smokers) or <48 (nonsmokers) 
years old and postmenopausal 
after a hysterectomy/bilateral 
oophorectomy or if they were <54 
(smokers) or <56 (nonsmokers) 
years old.40
Statistical Analysis
The primary analysis used the 1991 
baseline diet, as this represents 
diet earliest in adult life. For early 
adulthood fiber intake, participants 
contributed person-years from 
the date of return of the 1991 
questionnaire until the date of any 
cancer diagnosis, death, or end of 
follow-up period (June 1, 2011), 
whichever came first. For adolescent 
fiber intake, follow-up time 
began with return of the baseline 
questionnaire in 1998 with the same 
follow-up period. Participants were 
divided into quintiles according to 
their dietary intake. Cox proportional 
hazards regression was used to 
estimate RR and 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs) for each category, 
by using the lowest quintile of 
intake as the reference category. 
We replaced missing covariate data 
with carried-forward method for 
continuous variables and missing 
indicator method for categorical 
variables. To control for confounding 
by age or calendar time, or any 
possible 2-way interactions between 
these 2 time scales, the regression 
models included age in months as 
the time scale, stratified by calendar 
year of the current questionnaire 
cycle. Multivariable models also 
simultaneously adjusted for race, 
family history of BC in mother or 
sisters, history of BBD, smoking, 
height, BMI at age 18, weight change 
since age 18, age at menarche, 
parity and age at first birth, oral 
contraceptive use, menopausal 
status, postmenopausal hormone 
use, age at menopause, and early 
adulthood intakes of alcohol and 
energy. For adolescent fiber intake 
and BC risk, multivariable models 
additionally adjusted for adolescent 
alcohol intake and adolescent energy 
intake (instead of early adulthood 
energy intake). The median value 
for each quintile was used for tests 
for trend, modeled as a continuous 
variable.
We further examined whether the 
associations of fiber intake with BC 
risk depended on the other dietary 
factors and healthy eating. We 
therefore evaluated the influence 
of adjustment for alternate healthy 
eating index score41 as well as red 
meat, animal fat, or β-carotene. 
Because longer menstrual cycles 
have been associated with lower BC 
risk42 and higher dietary fiber intake 
may affect BC risk by increasing 
menstrual cycle length,43 we 
examined the association between 
dietary fiber intake and BC risk after 
further adjustment for menstrual 
cycle length. Because dietary 
intake has been hypothesized to 
affect breast carcinogenesis over 
an extended period of time, for a 
sensitivity analyses, we calculated 
premenopausal cumulative average 
fiber intake (by using the 1991, 
1995, 1999, 2003, and 2007 dietary 
data), stopping updating when 
a woman reached menopause. 
We also calculated average of 
adolescent and adult (1991) fiber 
intake. Because associations are 
affected by imperfect assessment of 
diet, the association between early 
adulthood fiber intake and BC was 
also corrected for measurement 
error using the regression calibration 
method.44–46 For the calibration of 
our dietary questionnaire, we used 
multiple weighted diet records as 
the true intake based on an earlier 
validation study in the Nurses’ Health 
Study.31 To examine whether the 
associations between fiber intake 
and BC risk were modified by BMI 
at age 18, a cross-product term of 
the ordinal score for BMI at age 
18 and fiber intake expressed as a 
continuous variable was included in 
the multivariable model. P values for 
tests for interactions were obtained 
from a likelihood ratio test. To 
examine differential associations of 
dietary fiber intake with BC risk by 
hormone receptor status, we used 
Cox proportional cause-specific 
hazards regression model with a 
duplication method for competing

risk data.47 All P values were 2-sided. 
SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, 
NC) was used for all analyses.
RESULTS
During 1 725 295 person-years of 
follow-up of 90 534 women, 2833 
women were diagnosed with invasive 
breast carcinoma. The age range of 
the participants at baseline in 1991 
was 27 to 44 years (mean 36.4 ± 
4.6 years). Among 44 263 women 
with data on adolescent fiber intake, 
1118 women were diagnosed with 
invasive BC from 1998 to 2011. 
Table 1 presents the distribution 
of risk factors for BC by quintiles 
of dietary fiber intake in 1991 and 
adolescence. Women with a higher 
fiber intake during either early 
adulthood or adolescence were less 
likely to be smokers and more likely 
to have earlier age at menarche, to be 
nulliparous, and to be older at first 
birth. Higher fiber intake during early 
adulthood was also associated with 
lower alcohol consumption and lower 
adulthood BMI as well as slightly 
higher rates of mammography 
screening (50% in quintile 5 of 
fiber intake and 46% in quintile 1) 
(Table 1).
Among all women, early adulthood 
total fiber intake was associated 
with significantly lower BC risk. 
In multivariable model, compared 
with the lowest quintile, RRs of BC 
across increasing quintiles of fiber 
intake were significantly lower by 
17%, 12%, 18%, and 19% (Ptrend 
= .002) (Table 2). This association 
was materially unchanged with 
adjustment for red meat intake, 
animal fat, or alternate healthy eating 
index (data not shown). Additional 
adjustment for β-carotene intake 
or menstrual cycle length did not 
change the association between fiber 
intake and BC (data not shown). We 
also observed a significant inverse 
association between fiber intake and 
premenopausal BC incidence (highest 
versus lowest quintile; RR 0.77; 95%

CI 0.66–0.90; Ptrend = .008). A slightly 
weaker association was observed 
among postmenopausal women, 
though this did not reach statistical 
significance (RR 0.87; 95% CI 0.70–
1.07; Ptrend = .29). 
In a sensitivity analysis using 
the cumulative average of 
premenopausal fiber intake, similar 
results were found (among all 
women: RR 0.84; 95% CI 0.75–0.95, 
Ptrend = .004; among premenopausal 
women: RR 0.83; 95% CI 0.71–
0.97; Ptrend = .008; and among 
postmenopausal women: RR 0.88; 
95% CI 0.71–1.08, Ptrend = .46; highest 
versus lowest quintile) (P = .67 for 
differences in RRs). After correction 
for measurement error in measuring 
adulthood fiber intake, treated as 
a continuous variable, the RR was 
deattenuated from 0.91 (0.85–0.98) 
to 0.81 (0.69–0.96) for each 10 g/
day of fiber intake in the age-adjusted 
model.
Adolescent fiber intake was only 
modestly correlated with early adult 
(1991) fiber intake (r = 0.34). Higher 
fiber intake during adolescence 
was associated with lower BC risk 
(RR 0.84; 95% CI 0.70–1.01; Ptrend = 
.04; highest versus lowest quintile) 
among all women. This association 
was minimally changed after 
additional adjustment for red meat 
intake (RR 0.86; 95% CI 0.71–1.04; 
Ptrend = .08; highest versus lowest 
quintile) and animal fat intake (RR 
0.81; 95% CI 0.66–0.99; Ptrend = .03; 
highest versus lowest quintile). 
Controlling for β-carotene or adult 
fiber intake minimally affected the 
RR, but the CI widened slightly so

the trend was marginally significant 
(comparing the highest versus lowest 
quintiles, adjusting for β-carotene: 
RR 0.84; 95% CI 0.67–1.05; Ptrend = 
.11; adjusting for early adulthood 
fiber: RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.73–1.07; 
Ptrend = .17). In this model with both 
adolescent and early adulthood fiber 
intake, the RR for adult fiber was 
0.81 (95% CI 0.66–1.00, Ptrend = .07). 
Similar associations with adolescent 
fiber intake were observed among 
premenopausal and postmenopausal 
women, though they did not 
reach statistical significance for 
postmenopausal BC (Table 2).
Among women with both early 
adulthood and adolescent dietary 
data (n = 41 092), for the average 
of intakes at both times, the RR 
of BC overall was 0.75 (95% CI 
0.62–0.91, Ptrend = .004) comparing 
the highest versus lowest quintile. 
A somewhat stronger association 
was seen for premenopausal than 
for postmenopausal BC (highest 
versus lowest quintile, among 
premenopausal women: RR 0.67; 
95% CI 0.50–0.89; Ptrend = .001; 
among postmenopausal women: RR 
0.85; 95% CI 0.63–1.14; Ptrend = .44). 
However, this difference was not 
significant (P = .25 for differences in 
RRs) (Fig 1).
When evaluating types of fiber, 
among all women, we observed 
a lower BC risk with higher early 
adulthood intake of fruit fiber and 
vegetable fiber (Table 3). Early 
adulthood soluble fiber (RR 0.86; 
95% CI 0.77–0.97; Ptrend = .02) and 
insoluble fiber (RR 0.80; 95% CI 
0.71–0.90; Ptrend < .001) were each 
associated with lower BC risk among 
all women.
When total dietary fiber intake was 
modeled as a continuous variable, 
each 10 g/day increase in fiber 
intake during early adulthood was 
associated with a 13% decrease 
in BC risk among all women (RR 
0.87; 95% CI 0.80–0.95) (Table 4). 
While high fiber intake during early 
adulthood was associated with lower 
risk of premenopausal ER+/PR+ BC 
(RR 0.68; 95% CI 0.58–0.79; for 
10 g/day), high fiber intake during 
adolescence was associated with 
lower risk of premenopausal ER−/
PR− BC (RR 0.49; 95% CI 0.29–0.85; 
for 10 g/day). However, the test for 
heterogeneity was not significant (for 
early adulthood fiber: Pheterogeneity = 
.08; for adolescent fiber: Pheterogeneity 
= .07). We also did not observe 
significant heterogeneity between 
adolescent and early adulthood fiber 
intake and tumor receptor status 
in overall or postmenopausal BC 
(Table 4).
We also examined whether

women, we additionally adjusted for hormone use (postmenopausal never users, postmenopausal

intake and BC risk differed by BMI 
at age 18. No significant interactions 
were noted (data not shown).
DISCUSSION
Our findings suggest that higher 
fiber intakes during adolescence and 
early adulthood are associated with 
reduced BC incidence in women. 
The associations were apparent 
for most sources of fiber and were 
independent of other dietary factors 
and healthy eating behavior.
Although no significant association 
was observed in nearly all 
prospective studies of dietary fiber 
and BC incidence,6–11,14,16,19–23 in a 
recently published meta-analysis of 
16 prospective studies24 a5% lower 
BC risk was seen for each 10 g/day 
increment of fiber intake. Our results 
are consistent, although stronger, 
with a 13% lower BC risk per 
10 g/day fiber increment during 
early adulthood and 14% lower BC 
risk per 10 g/day fiber increment 
during adolescence. Although a 
stronger association between soluble 
fiber and BC was observed in the 
meta-analysis,24 we noted an inverse 
association for both soluble and 
insoluble fibers. In addition, despite 
no association between specific fiber 
sources and BC in the meta-analysis, 
we observed inverse significant 
associations between fiber from fruits 
or vegetables and BC overall. In recent 
studies,48–50 we observed a positive 
association between red meat and 
animal fat intake and BC risk, but we 
found no appreciable difference in the 
results when additionally adjusted for 
them, suggesting that other dietary

factors are not a plausible explanation 
of the inverse associations observed 
with fiber intake.
Several biological mechanisms 
support the beneficial role of 
dietary fiber on BC risk. Fiber may 
reduce BC risk through improving 
insulin sensitivity51, and decreasing 
insulin-like growth factors.52 
Furthermore, dietary fiber may 
decrease plasma levels of estrogen by 
inhibiting colonic β-D-glucuronidase 
activity, resulting in decreased 
deconjugation and reabsorption of 
estrogen and thereby increased fecal 
excretion.4,53,54
This study has several limitations. 
This cohort does not represent 
random samples of US women, but 
it is unlikely that biological relations 
among women in this cohort will 
differ substantially from women 
in general. Women reported their 
adolescent diet when they were 
at age 33 to 52 years. However, 
the recalled adolescent diet was 
largely independent of current 
adult diet, and further evidence of 
validity came from the comparison 
of recalled adolescent diet and our 
questionnaire administered 10 
years later.35 Residual confounding 
is always of concern in any 
observational studies. Although we 
adjusted for a wide range of potential 
confounders for BC, we still could 
not rule out the possibility that 
other unmeasured or inadequately 
measured factors have confounded 
the true association. However, 
adjustment for confounders made 
the association stronger. Because 
foods high in fiber contain many 
other biologically active constituents, 
we cannot exclude the possibility 
that these contribute to lower BC 
incidence.
Our study has several strengths. 
To evaluate the importance of 
timing, we assessed the association 
between fiber intake during 
specific life periods (adolescence, 
early adulthood, and cumulative 
average of the premenopausal 
period). The dietary questionnaire 
used to assess fiber intake 
has documented validity, and 
we evaluated the association 
between fiber intake and BC after 
correction for measurement error 
as well as using the cumulative 
averages of repeated dietary 
assessments. Dietary information 
was evaluated before BC diagnosis, 
minimizing the possibility of 
recall bias. The large number of 
cases afforded adequate power to 
detect modest differences in risk, 
as well as the ability to examine 
BCs before and after menopause 
and by hormone receptor status. 
Detailed prospective and updated 
assessments of diet and other 
lifestyle factors reduced the 
likelihood of residual confounding.
CONCLUSIONS
The findings in this large prospective 
study support the hypothesis that 
consumption of foods high in fiber 
reduce BC risk. These results also 
suggest that dietary fiber intake 
during adolescence and early 
adulthood may be particularly 
important. Our findings are in line 
with the American Cancer Society

 ed by age in months at start of follow-up and calendar year of the current questionnaire cycle and was simultaneously adjusted for race (white, 
nonwhite), family history of BC in mother or sisters (yes, no), history of BBD (yes, no), smoking (never, past, current 1–14/day, current 15–24/day, current ≥25/day), height (<62, 62 to 
<65, 65 to <68, ≥68 inches), BMI at age 18 y (<18.5, 18.5 to <20.0, 20.0 to <22.5, 22.5 to <25.0, 25.0 to <30.0, ≥30.0), weight change since age 18 (continuous), age at menarche (<12, 12, 13, 
≥14 y), parity and age at fi
 rst birth (nulliparous, parity ≤2 and age at fi
 rst birth <25 y, parity ≤2 and age at fi
 rst birth 25 to <30 y, parity ≤2 and age at fi
 rst birth ≥30 y, parity 3 to 4 and 
age at fi
 rst birth <25 y, parity 3 to 4 and age at fi
 rst birth 25 to <30 y, parity 3 to 4 and age at fi
 rst birth ≥30 y, parity ≥5 and age at fi
 rst birth <25 y, parity ≥5 and age at fi
 rst birth ≥25 
y), oral contraceptive use (never, past, current), alcohol intake (nondrinker, <5, 5 to <15, ≥15 g/day), and energy intake (quintile). In postmenopausal women, we additionally adjusted 
for hormone use (postmenopausal never users, postmenopausal past users, postmenopausal current users) and age at menopause (<45, 45–46, 47–48, 49–50, 51–52, ≥53 y). Among all 
women, we additionally adjusted for hormone use and menopausal status (premenopausal, postmenopausal never users, postmenopausal past users, postmenopausal current users, 
unknown menopausal status) and age at menopause (premenopausal, unknown menopause, <45, 45–46, 47–48, 49–50, 51–52, ≥53 y). For adolescent fi
 ber, we additionally adjusted for 
adolescent alcohol intake (nondrinker, <1.5, 1.5 to <5, 5 to <10, ≥10 g/day) and adolescent energy intake (quintile; instead of adult energy intake).
