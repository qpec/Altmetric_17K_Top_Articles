IMPORTANCE Prevention of osteoporosis in adulthood begins with optimizing bone health in
early life. The longitudinal association between growth and bone accretion during childhood
is not fully understood.
OBJECTIVES To assess the acquisition of whole-body (WB) and skeletal site–specific bone
mineral content (BMC) relative to linear growth in a healthy, diverse, longitudinal cohort of
children, adolescents, and young adults and to test for differences related to sex and African
American race.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This investigation was a mixed longitudinal study with
annual assessments for up to 7 years at 5 US clinical centers. Participants were healthy
children, adolescents, and young adults. The study dates were July 2002 through March
2010. The dates of the analysis were June through December 2016.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Anthropometrics, BMC, and body composition via
dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. The superimposition by translation and rotation (SITAR)
analysis method was used to define the mean trajectories for height, WB lean soft tissue,
appendicular lean soft tissue, and WB and skeletal site–specific BMC acquisition and to
measure the age and magnitude of peak velocity for each parameter. The SITAR modeling was
performed separately by sex and self-reported race.
RESULTS Among 2014 healthy children, adolescents, and young adults (1022 [50.7%] female
and 479 [23.8%] African American) aged 5 to 19 years at study entry, the mean age of peak
height velocity was 13.1 years (95% CI, 13.0-13.2 years) in African American boys vs 13.4 years
(95% CI, 13.3-13.4 years) in non-African American boys (difference, −0.3 years; 95% CI, −0.4
to −0.1 years) and 11.0 years (95% CI, 10.8-11.1 years) in African American girls vs 11.6 years
(95% CI, 11.5-11.6 years) in non-African American girls (difference, −0.6 years; 95% CI, −0.7 to
−0.5 years). Age of peak acquisition of WB BMC was 14.0 years (95% CI, 13.8-14.1 years) in
African American boys vs 14.0 years (95% CI, 13.9-14.1 years) in non-African American boys
(difference, −0.0 years; 95% CI, −0.2 to 0.2 years) and 12.1 years (95% CI, 12.0-12.3 years) in
African American girls vs 12.4 years (95% CI, 12.3-12.5 years) in non-African American girls
(difference, −0.3 years; 95% CI, −0.4 to −0.1 years). At age 7 years, children had acquired
69.5% to 74.5% of maximal observed height but only 29.6% to 38.1% of maximal observed
WB BMC. Adolescents gained 32.7% to 35.8% of maximal observed WB BMC during the
2 years before and 2 years after peak height velocity. Another 6.9% to 10.7% of maximal
observed WB BMC occurred after linear growth had ceased. In the group at highest risk for
fracture, non-African American boys, peak fracture incidence occurred approximately 1 year
before peak height velocity.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this longitudinal study, height gains substantially outpaced
gains in BMC during childhood, which could contribute to fracture risk. A significant
proportion of bone is accrued after adult height is achieved. Therefore, late adolescence
represents a potentially underrecognized window of opportunity to optimize bone mass.

 T
he bone mass achieved by young adulthood is a criti-
cally important determinant of lifelong bone health.1 A
significant proportion of peak bone mass is acquired
during adolescence. Although linear growth and bone acqui-
sition are coordinated, they do not occur at exactly the same
pace. It has previously been hypothesized that a lag between
skeletal expansion and skeletal mineralization may contrib-
ute to an epidemiologically observed increase in fracture risk
in childhood.2 However, few pediatric studies have contained
sufficiently detailed longitudinal measurements to character-
ize the difference in pace between gains in height and gains
in bone throughout childhood, adolescence, and young
adulthood. The strong associations between bone mineral
content (BMC) accrual and lean soft tissue (LST) are also
important to consider.3,4 Moreover, the association between
growth, body composition, and BMC accrual may be specific
to the particular skeletal site and may vary with sex and race.
We and others have previously demonstrated differences in
skeletal development in African American children com-
pared with non-African American children.5,6 The degree to
which sex- and race-related differences in adult bone density
are attributable to differences in the timing and magnitude of
developmental gains in bone mass remains unknown.
Therefore, the present study aimed (1) to assess the
acquisition of whole-body (WB) and skeletal site–specific
BMC relative to linear growth, WB LST, and appendicular
LST (aLST) (reflecting mostly skeletal muscle in the limbs7)
between ages 5 and 20 years in a healthy, diverse, longitudi-
nal cohort and (2) to test for differences related to sex and
African American race. We used innovative techniques that
have significantly increased the feasibility of such
investigations.8
Methods
Study Sample
The Bone Mineral Density in Childhood Study (BMDCS)5 was
a mixed longitudinal investigation of 2014 children enrolled
at 5 US centers who were evaluated between July 2002 and
March 2010. The dates of the analysis were June through De-
cember 2016. Participants (aged 5-19 years at study entry) were
evaluated annually for up to 7 years. Inclusion and exclusion
criteria were specified to obtain a healthy sample of children
without medical problems known to adversely influence bone
health.5 Height and body mass index of each participant at
study entry were required to be between the 3rd and 97th per-
centiles for age and sex.
The protocol was approved by the institutional review
boards at each clinical center (The Children’
s Hospital of
Philadelphia, Cincinnati Children’
s Hospital Medical Center,
Creighton University, Children’
s Hospital Los Angeles, and
Columbia University) and the data coordinating center (Clini-
cal Trials and Survey Corporation). Consent was obtained
from the parent or guardian for participants younger than 18
years, and assent was obtained from participants. Written
informed consent was obtained from study participants 18
years or older.
Self-reported Race
Individuals were categorized as African American or non-
African American. Children’
s race was based on the parent’
s
report.5
Physical Examination
Height, weight, and Tanner stage5 were assessed following
standard procedures. Sex-specific body mass index and height
z scores were calculated.9
Body Composition
Whole-body, posteroanterior lumbar spine, proximal femur,
and forearm (distal one-third radius and ultradistal radius)
dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans were
acquired on bone densitometers (QDR4500A, QDR4500W,
and Delphi A; Hologic) for determination of BMC and areal
bone mineral density (aBMD). All scans were analyzed cen-
trally by the DXA Core Laboratory at the University of Cali-
fornia, San Francisco, using Hologic (release 12.3) software.10
Both WB and aLST (excluding bone) were determined and
corrected for intermachine differences and longitudinal
drift. Whole-body and site-specific BMC and aBMD z scores,
adjusted for age- and sex-specific height z scores, were
calculated.10
Fracture
Participants were asked whether they had experienced a
fracture in the previous year. This question was asked at
each follow-up visit.
Statistical Analysis
Characteristics of the cohort were summarized with paramet-
ric or nonparametric statistics as appropriate. We used a
growth modeling approach called superimposition by trans-
lation and rotation (SITAR),8 which generates a shape-
invariant model with a single fitted curve. Models with dif-
ferent df were tested empirically and evaluated with respect
Key Points
Question How does the association between linear growth and
bone accrual during childhood and adolescence affect bone
health?
Findings In this mixed longitudinal study of 2014 healthy children,
adolescents, and young adults using an innovative approach to
model growth in a diverse cohort, we found that, at age 7 years,
children had acquired 69.5% to 74.5% of maximal observed height
but only 29.6% to 38.1% of maximal observed whole-body bone
mineral content. Also, adolescents gained 32.7% to 35.8% of
maximal observed whole-body bone mineral content during the 4
years around peak height velocity and another 6.9% to 10.7% of
maximal observed whole-body bone mineral content in late
adolescence, even after linear growth had ceased.
Meaning The important physiological lag between gains in bone
and gains in height may contribute to the increased risk for
fracture in childhood and indicates that late adolescence
represents a potentially underrecognized opportunity for clinical
and public health interventions to maximize peak bone mass.

 to goodness of fit. For each individual and for each dimen-
sion of growth (height, WB and skeletal site–specific BMC
acquisition, WB LST, and aLST), 3 parameters were estimated
as random effects for each individual that correspond to key
features of variation in growth. These parameters included
size (individuals can be larger or smaller than average),
tempo (the timing of the adolescent spurt can be earlier or
later than average), and velocity (the duration of the adoles-
cent spurt can be more or less rapid than average). By design,
SITAR permits inclusion of individuals with missing data and
reduces complex growth curves into these 3 clinically mean-
ingful parameters that can be compared across individuals
and groups. We tested models with 4 to 8 df11 and used visu-
alization, along with the Bayesian information criterion, to
identify the best model. Results were used to estimate the
age and magnitude of peak velocity for each individual
participant.12 As in previous investigations from the BMDCS,5
we fit separate models for African American and non-African
American children. We used the standard error of the tempo
parameter in the sex- and race-stratified SITAR models as an
estimate of the standard error of age of peak height velocity
(PHV), and we used the standard error of the velocity param-
eter as a proportional standard error for peak velocity.8 Sum-
mary statistics were used to perform sex-stratified t tests to
assess the difference between African Americans and non-
African Americans for each parameter. We report unadjusted
P values and indicate those that meet the Bonferroni-
adjusted P value threshold of less than 0.0028 (0.05 divided
by 18 sex-stratified comparisons).
The difference in growth velocity parameters by race (Afri-
can American vs non-African American) was assessed using
2-sample t tests for girls and boys separately. We expressed the
magnitude of BMC and LST parameters at the age of PHV rela-
tive to maximal observed value before 20 years or the value
at age 20 years, whichever was greater (referred to as maxi-
mal observed value) because the age of PHV serves as a com-
mon point of reference. We estimated the proportion of maxi-
mal observed BMC and LST that is acquired during the
following 2 periods of interest: (1) during the 2 years before and
2 years after PHV and (2) after peak height (linear growth ve-
locity <1 cm/y) was achieved. Pearson product moment cor-
relation analyses were used to investigate the association be-
tween the size, tempo, and velocity parameters obtained by
SITAR in each of the dimensions of growth. To understand the
association between pubertal timing and SITAR parameters,
we visualized these parameters with the cohort stratified into
previously defined categories of age of pubertal onset (within
the BMDCS cohort, <25th percentile, 25th to <75th percen-
tile, and ≥75th percentile).13 Analysis of variance was used to
evaluate the association of the age of peak velocity and peak
velocity in each parameter with the category of pubertal tim-
ing. To understand how observed trajectories of linear growth
and bone acquisition may relate to fracture vulnerability, we
calculatedtheannualizedincidenceofanyfractureineachyear
of life by sex and race.
All analyses were conducted using R (version 3.1.3),14 in-
cluding the SITAR extension package.15 Statistical signifi-
cance was taken as a 2-sided P value of less than .05.
Results
Sample Characteristics
The sample consisted of 2014 healthy children, adolescents,
and young adults (1022 [50.7%] female and 479 [23.8%] Afri-
can American), who completed a mean of 5 annual visits each
(eTable 1 in the Supplement). These visits represent a range of
pubertal stages, with 5001 of 10 695 (46.8%) visits occurring
in postpubertal (Tanner V) adolescents.
SITAR Trajectories
The mean trajectory curves are shown in Figure 1A (for mag-
nitude of attained BMC and LST) and Figure 1B (for velocity
of BMC and LST) by sex and race. As expected, older boys were
taller and had more BMC and LST than older girls. For boys,
peak velocity in all parameters occurred later and was greater
in magnitude. Across childhood, the absolute amount of both
BMC and LST was greater in African American children and
adolescentscomparedwithnon-AfricanAmericanchildrenand
adolescents despite overall similar heights.
Estimates of the Age and Magnitude of Peak Velocities
As summarized in Table 1 and Table 2, the mean age of PHV
occurred significantly earlier in African American boys com-
pared with non-African American boys (13.1 vs 13.4 years)
(difference, −0.3 years, 95% CI, −0.4 to −0.1 years) and signifi-
cantly earlier in African American girls compared with non-
African American girls (11.0 vs 11.6 years) (difference, −0.6
years, 95% CI, −0.7 to −0.5 years). Age of peak acquisition of
WB BMC was similar in African American boys compared with
non-African American boys (14.0 vs 14.0 years) (difference,
−0.0 years; 95% CI, −0.2 to 0.2 years). Age of peak acquisition
of WB BMC was significantly younger in African American girls
compared with non-African American girls (12.1 vs 12.4 years)
(difference, −0.3 years; 95% CI, −0.4 to −0.1 years), and a simi-
lar pattern was observed at all skeletal sites. Model-derived es-
timates of peak velocity of WB BMC accrual lagged behind PHV
by 0.6 to 0.9 years in boys and by 0.8 to 1.2 years in girls in this
cohort (Figure 2). Figure 2 also shows that, before the age of
peak velocity in each parameter, the relative pace of linear
growth is faster than the relative pace of WB BMC accrual. For
example, at age 7 years, height velocity is 62.9% to 76.3% of
PHV, but WB BMC velocity is 27.8% to 31.9% of peak WB BMC
velocity. In eFigure 1 in the Supplement, a consequence of
this discrepancy is shown, namely, that the proportion of
maximal observed value is larger for height than for bone.
For example, at age 7 years, children had acquired 69.5% to
74.5% of maximal observed height but only 29.6% to 38.1%
of maximal observed BMC. Also, both African American and
non-African American boys at age 10 years have achieved
79.0% and 78.2%, respectively, of maximal observed height
but only 41.2% and 39.7%, respectively, of maximal ob-
served BMC.
Age at which peak velocity for the acquisition of each
parameter occurs is shown in eFigure 2 in the Supplement.

curred before peak gains in WB BMC, lumbar spine, and dis-

 eFigure 2 in the Supplement). We found that adolescents
have attained 90.0% to 90.4% of maximal observed height
and approximately 57.6% to 60.2% of maximal observed WB
BMC by the time of their PHV (Table 3). The continued accre-
tion of BMC for most skeletal sites in late adolescence up to
age 20 years is shown in Figure 1B. Overall, approximately
32.7% to 35.8% of predicted maximal adult BMC was
acquired in the 2 years before and 2 years after the age of
PHV (Figure 2 and eTable 2 in the Supplement). Approxi-
mately 6.9% to 10.7% of maximal observed BMC is acquired
in late adolescence after peak height has been achieved. The
proportion of maximal observed BMC acquired in late ado-
lescence also varies with skeletal site and was highest at the
ultradistal radius, with 13.0% to 17.8% of maximal observed
BMC attained after achievement of adult height. The SITAR-
estimated age of peak velocity (ie, tempo) in growth in
height, WB LST, and aLST show similar high correlations
with site-specific BMC accrual (Pearson ρ range, 0.72-0.88
[P < .001] for all parameters).
With respect to sexual maturation, we found that, in both
girls and boys, earlier pubertal timing was associated with
younger age of peak velocity as well as more rapid velocity; this
pattern was consistent across growth parameters tested (eFig-
ure3intheSupplement).Ratesoffracturewerehighestinnon-
African American boys and overall lower in African American
children (eFigure 4 in the Supplement). For the highest-risk
group, non-African American boys, fracture rates were highest
atapproximatelyage12.5yearsbeforetheageofPHV(13.4years).

 substantially less BMC relative to height, which may contrib-
ute to their increased incidence of fracture. Similar to previ-
ous analyses in this cohort,16 we observe this increased inci-
dence of fracture before PHV most clearly in non-African
American boys. Our analyses reveal strong associations be-
tweentrajectoriesofbothheightandLSTacquisitionwithBMC
accrual. Most important, we illustrate the extended acquisi-
tionofbonethatoccurswellafterthecessationoflineargrowth
in both girls and boys.
Our results show similarities with another seminal study
of the timing of peak bone mineral accrual. Specifically, the
Saskatchewan Pediatric Bone Mineral Accrual Study was a
6-year longitudinal investigation, beginning in 1991, of 113 chil-
dren of mostly white race who were aged 8 to 14 years at
enrollment.17,18 The age of PHV estimates were similar to those
obtained in the BMDCS for non-African American partici-
pants. The investigators found that adolescents had attained
approximately 90% of adult height and approximately 60%
of adult WB BMC by the time of their PHV, estimates that are
also similar to those obtained in the BMDCS in non-African
American participants. We show that earlier puberty is asso-
ciated with more rapid physical maturation (eFigure 3 in the
Supplement). It has long been known that the timing and mag-
nitude of the velocity curve differs between children who are
early, typical, and late maturing19; this phenomenon is cap-
tured well by the SITAR models. The present study adds sub-
stantially to this previous work in that it provides a more con-
temporary assessment of skeletal development and, most
important, includes both estimates in African American chil-
dren and at multiple skeletal sites.
We also observed sex- and race-specific differences in the
acquisitionofBMCandLST.Thesedifferencesrecapitulatepat-
ternsobservedintheBMDCS5andinotherdiversecohorts.20,21
Overall, as expected, girls had lower BMC and LST than boys
after peak linear growth, and peak acquisition of BMC and LST
occurred sooner. With respect to race in both girls and boys,
despitehavingsimilarheights,AfricanAmericangirlsandAfri-
canAmericanboyshadmoreWBLST,aLST,andBMCthantheir
non-African American counterparts. In African American girls
and boys, peak gain in height, WB LST, and aLST occurred ear-
lier than in their non-African American counterparts; in Afri-
can American girls, consistent differences were observed for
BMC as well. Multiple previous studies have also demon-
strated race-specific effects on bone development. For ex-
ample, in a cross-sectional study,22 differences in cancellous
vertebral bone density were significantly greater in African
American girls in late puberty (34% vs 11% increase from pre-
pubertal values). Our longitudinal study adds to these cross-
sectional observations and suggests that race-specific differ-
ences in trajectories of BMC and LST acquisition may underlie
the increased fracture prevalence among children16 and the
higher rates of osteoporosis and hip fracture among adults of
white race23 compared with African Americans.
To better understand determinants of bone health across
the life span, we modeled the acquisition of BMC at various
skeletal sites. This finding is important because skeletal sites
can differ in many ways, including their exposure to weight-
bearing forces and the relative contribution of cortical and tra-
becular bone to DXA estimates of aBMD. We found that, al-
though growth patterns at specific sites were correlated, the
timing of peak bone mineral accrual and the cessation of BMC
acquisition differed by skeletal site (eFigure 2 in the Supple-
ment). For total hip and femoral neck, the mean BMC accrual
approached zero by age 20 years, particularly for female par-
ticipants (ie, there was evidence of a cessation of BMC gain and
the beginning of loss in early adulthood at these sites rich in
trabecular bone) (Figure 1). Other investigations have shown
that trabecular bone loss can occur in young adulthood, es-
pecially from the predominantly trabecular bone of the lum-
bar spine.24 In contrast, even after linear growth ceases, young
adults continue to gain cortical bone, and cortical bone loss
may not occur until the fourth or fifth decade of life.25,26 The
persistence of BMC acquisition in the distal one-third radius
that we observed after age 20 years in the BMDCS (Figure 1)
may reflect ongoing gains in cortical bone.
Similar to previous investigations,17 we identified a lag be-
tweentheacquisitionofheightandtheacquisitionofBMCrela-
tive to maximal observed values (Figure 2 and eFigure 1 in the
Supplement). One possible consequence of this lag is that the
proportional load borne by cortical bone decreases around the
time of PHV, a period that corresponds in some investiga-
tions to peak epidemiological incidence of fracture.27 Most im-
portant, we found that in childhood, well before PHV, chil-
dren gain height more rapidly than they accrue BMC. The
slower rate of BMC relative to height acquisition in childhood
may explain the epidemiological observation that the win-
dowoffracturevulnerabilitymaybeginmanyyearsbeforePHV.
Indeed, we observed that, on average, in non-African Ameri-
can boys (the group that experienced the most fractures) the
highest incidence of fracture was at approximately age 12.5
years, before the mean PHV. The lag typically observed be-
tween gains in height and bone may be due to the expansion
incorticalthickness,cross-sectionalarea,anddensitythatcon-
tinues even after the cessation of linear growth.24,28 How-
ever, differences in lag do not appear to explain race-specific
variations in fracture rates.
Strengths and Limitations
The present study has several important strengths and limi-
tations. By design, the cohort is approximately 24% African
American, which permits analysis of African American–
specific associations. Although we used self-reported race, our
group has previously shown that such report is associated with
genetic ancestry.6 Use of the novel SITAR modeling strategy
isanotheradvantagebecauseSITARreadilyaccommodatesthe
range in the number and timing of measurements that can oc-
cur in a longitudinal study. In addition, by reducing the di-
mensionality of complex growth curves, SITAR facilitates the
investigation of the influence of clinical covariates or even
therapeutic interventions29 on growth. Inclusion of more par-
ticipants in the third and fourth decades of life would likely
improve the SITAR model fitting in late adolescence. We used
DXA to estimate site-specific BMC. While DXA may not cap-
ture important dimensions of bone quality, DXA-based assess-
ments are also used in clinical practice to evaluate bone health.
However, future studies using newer imaging techniques

 should be undertaken. Also, it would be informative to ex-
tend these longitudinal observations into adulthood to explic-
itly evaluate the influence of developmental parameters on
osteoporosis and fracture.
Conclusions
In summary, in a longitudinal cohort, we report sex and race
differences in the size, tempo, and velocity of WB and skel-
etal site–specific BMC accrual. Consistent with historical
reports in children of almost exclusively European descent,
we found that all adolescents gained a substantial propor-
tion of maximal observed BMC during pubertal growth.
However, despite the clear importance of linear growth to
bone health, we also found that, even after linear growth has
ceased, approximately 6.9% to 10.7% of maximal observed
WB BMC is accrued in late adolescence. We also found that,
for many years before PHV, bone accretion proceeds at a
modest pace compared with gains in height, which may con-
tribute to the increased vulnerability to fracture that we
observed, particularly in non-African American boys. A
detailed understanding of sex and race associations, as well
as the developmental timing of BMC accrual, is critical for
the development of rational strategies to optimize peak bone
mass.1
