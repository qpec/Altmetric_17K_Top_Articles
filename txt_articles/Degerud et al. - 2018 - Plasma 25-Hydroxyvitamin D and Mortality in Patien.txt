Context and Objective: Vitamin D status may affect cardiovascular disease (CVD) development
and survival. We studied the relationship between concentrations of the circulating biomarker
25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality risk.
Design, Setting, Participants, and Main Outcome Measures: 25OHD, the sum of 25-hydroxyvitamin
D3 and 25-hydroxyvitamin D2, was analyzed in plasma samples from 4114 white patients suspected
of having stable angina pectoris and was adjusted for seasonal variation. Hazard ratios (HRs) for all-
cause and cardiovascular mortality were estimated by using multivariable Cox models with 25OHD
as the main exposure variable, with adjustment for study site, age, sex, smoking, body mass index,
estimated glomerular filtration rate, and systolic blood pressure.
Results: A total of 895 (21.8%) deaths, including 407 (9.9%) from CVD causes, occurred during a
mean 6 standard deviation follow-up of 11.9 6 3.0 years. Compared with the first 25OHD quartile,
HRs in the second, third, and fourth quartiles were 0.64 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.54 to 0.77],
0.56 (95% CI, 0.46 to 0.67), and 0.56 (95% CI, 0.46 to 0.67) for all-cause mortality and 0.70 (95% CI,
0.53 to 0.91), 0.60 (95% CI, 0.45 to 0.79), and 0.57 (95% CI, 0.43 to 0.75) for cardiovascular mortality,
respectively. Threshold analysis demonstrated increased all-cause and CVD mortality in patients
with 25OHD concentrations below ;42.5 nmol/L. Moreover, analysis suggested increased all-cause
mortality at concentrations .100 nmol/L.
Conclusion: Plasma 25OHD concentrations were inversely associated with cardiovascular mortality
and nonlinearly (U-shaped) associated with all-cause mortality. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 103:
1161–1170, 2018)
P
lasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) is an in-
termediate metabolite in the conversion of acquired
and stored vitamin D to the active metabolite calcitriol. A
plasma concentration above 50 nmol/L is the target level
for dietary intake recommendations of vitamin D in
several countries (1, 2), based on differentiation between
optimal and suboptimal skeletal health (1).
Vitamin D activity is implicated in the etiology of
noncommunicable diseases (3), including cardiovascu-
lar diseases (CVDs), where calcitriol may regulate gene

 expression in cells involved in atherosclerosis (4, 5).
Reduced vitamin D activity, as a result of dietary de-
ficiency (6), metabolic dysfunction (7), or reduced
availability of the vitamin D receptor (8), causes the
development of unfavorable cardiovascular phenotypes
in mice. These mechanistic studies demonstrate that
vitamin D activity is required for cardiovascular health,
which raises the question of whether physiologic vari-
ation in vitamin D status in humans may be implicated in
the etiology or progression of CVDs.
Meta-analyses of prospective observational studies
among predominantly healthy participants have in-
dicated an inverse relationship between 25OHD levels
and CVD mortality (9, 10). However, this relation is not
observed when genetic variants are used as instrumental
variables for 25OHD concentration (11–14), and pub-
lished randomized controlled trials have not detected any
effect of vitamin D supplementation on incident CVD
(15, 16). Moreover, some prospective observational
studies reported that a very high vitamin D status could
be detrimental to CVD or all-cause mortality (17–19).
In contrast to studies among healthy persons, pro-
spective observational studies in patients with stable CVD
have reported inconsistent results for the association
between 25OHD and the risk for CVD events (20–22).
Additional studies could help determine whether the
association is similar or differs between patients with
CVD and healthy individuals. This is relevant to the
extent to which results from ongoing clinical trials in
healthy individuals may be generalized to patients. In the
current study, we contribute with data on the relationship
between circulating 25OHD concentration and the risk
for all-cause and CVD mortality in 4114 patients suspected
of having stable angina pectoris (SAP). An additional
objective was to identify potential threshold concentra-
tions associated with mortality, and stratified analyses
were conducted to assess for differences in groups of
statin treatment, disease status, and smoking status.
Patients and Methods
Study population
We used prospective observational data from 4164 adult and
mostly white patients who underwent elective coronary angi-
ography for suspicion of SAP at two university hospitals
(Haukeland University Hospital and Stavanger University
Hospital) in Norway (situated at 59 to 60 degrees North) (23).
Recruitment started 14 April 1999 and ended 26 April 2004.
We excluded 50 patients because of missing data and thus
included 4114 patients in the final statistical analyses. Of these
patients, 62% were also participants in the Western Norway
B-Vitamin Intervention Trial (WENBIT; ClinicalTrials.gov
identifier: NCT00354081) (24). WENBIT was a randomized
trial aiming to study the effects of folic acid + vitamin B12 and/
or vitamin B6 vs placebo on CVD and mortality outcomes,
with a median follow-up period of 38 months. The studies were
conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of
Helsinki and approved by the Regional Committee for Medical
and Health Research Ethics and the Norwegian Data Protection
Authority. Participants gave written informed consent.
Baseline data and biochemical analyses
Self-administered questionnaires provided information on
medical history, CVD risk factors, and medication. The data
were validated against medical records when available. Ques-
tionnaires also asked about vitamin D supplement consumption
and leisure time physical activity levels. Measurements of blood
pressure, anthropometry, and blood sampling were conducted
by trained study personnel. At Haukeland University Hospital,
nonfasting blood samples were drawn before angiography. At
Stavanger University Hospital, samples were taken from fasting
patients in conjunction with the angiographic procedure. Par-
ticipants who reported that they were current smokers or in-
dicated that they have quit smoking #90 days before blood
sampling, or those who had a measured plasma cotinine
concentration $85nmol/L, were defined as smokers. Plasma
cotinine was measured by liquid chromatography tandem mass
spectrometry (25) at Bevital AS (Bergen, Norway). In addition,
information was collected on the angiographic extent of clini-
cally significant ($50% diameter stenosis) coronary artery
disease (CAD), measurement of left ventricular ejection frac-
tion, C-reactive protein (CRP), apolipoprotein A1, and apoli-
poprotein B 100, as described previously (23). Estimated
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated with the for-
mula suggested by the Chronic Kidney Disease–Epidemiology
Collaboration (26). Diabetes mellitus was defined as a pre-
existing diagnosis of type 1 or 2 diabetes. Plasma 25OHD2
and 25OHD3 concentrations were analyzed by using liquid
chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (27) at Bevital AS.
25OHD2 and 25OHD3 values below the lower limit of
quantification (6.6 nmol/L) were set to zero.
Follow-up and endpoints
Participants were followed until death or through 1 January
2013. Endpoints were defined according to the International
Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10), and CVD
death included deaths ascribed to ICD-10 codes I00 and I99 in
addition to R96. Information on cause of death was obtained from
the Cause of Death Registry at Statistics Norway by linkage using
each patient’s unique personal identification number.
Statistical analyses
Each patient’s measured value of plasma 25OHD3 was
adjusted for the seasonal variation in the study sample by
using a cosinor model (28). The concentrations of 25OHD2 and
seasonally adjusted 25OHD3 were then summed to reflect total
25OHD. Baseline characteristics are presented as mean 6
standard deviation (SD) for continuous variables and numbers
(percentages) for categorical variables. Characteristics were
assessed and compared across plasma 25OHD quartiles by
linear regression for continuous variables and logistic regression
for categorical variables. Survival curves for all-cause and CVD
mortality according to 25OHD were calculated with the
Kaplan-Meier estimator and differences assessed by log-rank
testing. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals
(CIs) were assessed by using Cox proportional hazard models,

 and the assumption of proportional hazards was assessed by
checking the Schoenfeld residuals. Covariates in multivariable
models included study site, age, sex, smoking, body mass index,
systolic blood pressure, and eGFR.
The risk for all-cause and CVD mortality was first assessed
by modeling 25OHD as quartiles and thereafter as a continuous
variable per 10-nmol/L incremental increase of 25OHD. We
then visualized the association of 25OHD by adding penalized
smoothing splines to the multivariable Cox model. The re-
lationships were subsequently analyzed for possible thresholds.
Following steps described previously (29), we considered values
of 25OHD between 15 and 150 nmol/L with increments of 0.01
as a series of cutoff values that could be used to identify potential
thresholds. For all cutoff values, we created a dichotomous
exposure variable and included it in a Cox model while
adjusting for aforementioned covariates. We then extracted
Wald statistics for each model, which is closer to null when the
relationship between all explanatory variables and the outcome
is weaker and increases when the relationship is stronger. The
cutoff value of 25OHD resulting in the model with the highest
Wald statistic was considered as a potential threshold because it
provides the most optimal separation of participants with high
and low risk for the outcome (30). In addition, potential
thresholds were considered from a combined interpretation of
both the Wald statistics and the exposure-outcome relationship.
Furthermore, we used the potential thresholds to categorize
participants according to low, medium, and high 25OHD
concentration. These categories were subsequently described
and compared in terms of baseline characteristics, survival
curves, and HRs.
We also assessed the risk for all-cause and CVD mortality by
using threshold-derived categories of 25OHD concentrations in
subgroups of sex, smoking status, CAD, diabetes, chronic
kidney disease (eGFR #60 mL/min per 1.73 m2), statin treat-
ment, and WENBIT intervention groups receiving combina-
tions of B vitamins or placebo. In this analysis, non-WENBIT
participants were categorized as receiving placebo. To test
whether the risk differed by the subgroups, we tested for effect
modification on a multiplicative scale and present the results as
HRs with 95% CIs and P values. Statistical analyses were
performed by using R statistical software (31). We included
additional analyses as part of the peer review process. The
association between vitamin D supplement use and the risk for
all-cause and CVD mortality were assessed in multivariable
models adjusting for the same covariates as in the analysis of
plasma 25OHD. We also described the participants with de-
tectable 25OHD2 concentrations in more detail to evaluate the
possibility of reverse causation.
Results
Baseline characteristics
Plasma 25OHD ranged from 8.4 to 197 nmol/L,
with a mean 6 SD of 59.7 6 19.2 nmol/L. The distri-
bution of baseline characteristics across plasma 25OHD
quartiles showed a positive relationship with vitamin D
supplementation, physical activity, serum apolipoprotein
A1 concentrations, LVEF, and statin use after the baseline
visit and an inverse relationship with smoking, body mass
index, inflammation (CRP level), diabetes, kidney function
(eGFR), and serum triglyceride concentrations (Table 1).
The proportion of patients taking vitamin D supplements
regularly in each quartile were 20%, 30%, 40%, and 50%,
respectively. The uneven distribution of patients from each
study site indicated higher plasma 25OHD at one study site
(HaukelandUniversityHospital,Bergen;60.66 19.8nmol/L)
in comparison with the other site (Stavanger University
Hospital, Stavanger; 55.5 6 17.3 nmol/L).
Associations between plasma 25OHD and all-cause
and CVD mortality
Mean 6 SD duration of follow-up was 11.9 6 3.0
years. A total of 895 (21.8%) deaths from all causes and
407 (9.9%) deaths from CVD occurred during follow-up.
In comparison with the lowest quartile, multivariable HRs
(95% CI) in the three upper quartiles of 25OHD concen-
tration were 0.64 (95% CI, 0.54 to 0.77), 0.56 (95% CI,
0.46 to 0.67), and 0.56 (95% CI, 0.46 to 0.67) for all-cause
mortality and 0.70 (95% CI, 0.53 to 0.91), 0.60 (95% CI,
0.45 to 0.79), and 0.57 (95% CI, 0.43 to 0.75) for CVD
mortality, respectively (Table 2). Plasma 25OHD was in-
versely associated with the risk for all-cause and CVD
mortality in multivariable models per 10-nmol/L incre-
mental increase of 25OHD, with HRs of 0.91 (95% CI,
0.88 to 0.95) and 0.90 (95% CI, 0.85 to 0.95), respectively.
Potential thresholds for relationship between
plasma 25OHD and all-cause and CVD mortality
The distribution of plasma 25OHD in the study
sample is shown in Fig. 1A. The exposure-outcome re-
lationships of plasma 25OHD with the risks for all-cause
mortality and CVD mortality are shown in Fig. 1B and
1C, respectively, and suggest nonlinear relationships.
Potential thresholds were identified at 42.5 nmol/L for
all-cause mortality (Fig. 1D) and at 40.9 nmol/L for CVD
mortality (Fig. 1E). A second potential threshold for both
endpoints at 100 nmol/L was indicated by the nonlinear
risk curves and threshold analyses.
Because the potential thresholds for all-cause and CVD
mortality were similar, we chose to categorize the patients
only according to the thresholds for all-cause mortality,
including low (,42.5 nmol/L; n = 779), medium (42.5 to
100 nmol/L; n = 3214), and high (.100 nmol/L; n = 121)
25OHD concentrations. Cross-sectional differences in
baseline characteristics according to these categories were
similar to the differences between quartiles (Supplemental
Table 1). Kaplan-Meier survival curves for all-cause and
CVD mortality are shown for participants with low,
medium, and high concentrations of 25OHD (Fig. 2). Log-
rank test indicated a difference in survival between the
groups for both endpoints (P , 0.001). In comparison
with individuals with medium 25OHD concentrations,
multivariable HRs for all-cause and CVD mortality were

 1.94 (95% CI, 1.66 to 2.27) and 1.87 (95% CI, 1.49 to
2.36) among those with low concentrations and 1.79 (95%
CI, 1.31 to 2.46) and 1.44 (95% CI, 0.87 to 2.37) among
those with high concentrations, respectively (Table 3).
Subgroup analyses
The excess risk for all-cause and CVD mortality as-
sociated with plasma 25OHD ,42.5 nmol/L did not vary
substantially in subgroups of sex, smoking status, extent
of CAD, diabetes, kidney function, statin treatment, or
WENBIT study treatment, but trends toward differences
were observed for plasma 25OHD .100 nmol/L (Sup-
plemental Tables 2 and 3). The excess risk for all-cause
mortality for patients with 25OHD .100 nmol/L appeared
to be confined to patients with CAD and to statin users
(79% with CAD and 53% without CAD use statins),
whereas the excess risk for CVD mortality was confined
to statin users and participants without chronic kidney

intake of cod liver oil or vitamin D supplements, HRs
among participants with regular intake were 0.92 (95%
CI, 0.79 to 1.07) for all-cause mortality and 0.75 (95%
CI, 0.60 to 0.95) for CVD mortality. The 80 individuals
with detectable levels of 25OHD2 constituted 1%, 2%, and
7% of the groups with low, medium, and high 25OHD
concentrations, respectively, and were collectively more
likely to die during follow-up (35%) than the sample as a
whole (22%).
Discussion
Principal findings
Plasma 25OHD demonstrated an inverse association
with CVD mortality and a nonlinear (U-shaped) association

high- and low-risk groups for both endpoints and that a
threshold of 100 nmol/Lmight further discriminate between
low and high risk for all-cause mortality.
Previous observational studies
Previous observational studies of the relation between
25OHD and CVD risk were mostly conducted in pop-
ulations without CHD, most of which report inverse
relationships (32, 33); however, a few studies, such as the
large Danish Cop-D study, report nonlinear relationships
(19, 34). Among the studies performed in patients with
CHD, themost comparabletoourstudyistheLudwigshafen
Risk and Cardiovascular Health (LURIC) study (20),
which included 3258 white German patients referred
to coronary angiography for suspicion of SAP or acute
coronary syndrome. The prevalence of clinically signifi-
cant CAD (68%) at baseline was similar to that in our
study sample (75%). The authors observed an inverse
linear association with all-cause and CVD mortality
across quartiles of 25OHD, with no indications of a
U-shaped pattern when they compared the lowest and
highest 25OHD deciles. A lower mean total 25OHD
concentration (42.4 nmol/L in the LURIC study vs
59.7 nmol/L in the current study) may explain why an
increased risk at high concentrations (.100 nmol/L) was
not observed in the LURIC study. The higher observed
25OHD concentrations in this study may be the result of
high vitamin D supplement use in the sample (35%), as
well as in Norwegians in general, which is mostly in the
form of cod liver oil. When all confounders and potential
mediators were included, neither the German KAROLA
study (n = 1125; median 25OHD of 55 nmol/L) nor the
American Heart and Soul Study (n = 946; mean 25OHD
of 64.5 nmol/L) demonstrated an association with all-
cause or CVD mortality after 8 years of follow-up in
mostly white patients with stable coronary heart disease

25OHD and Mortality in Stable Angina Pectoris

 (21, 22). In contrast, a U-shaped association between
serum 25OHD and the risk for in-hospital death and
12-month mortality was observed in German patients
undergoing cardiac surgery (18). And lastly, a recent clinical
trial in patients with heart failure found that patients who
were randomly assigned to vitamin D supplements, and
who thereby obtained a 25OHD level .100 nmol/L, had
greater need for mechanical circulatory support implan-
tation during 3 years of follow-up compared with those
receiving placebo (although they were not at increased risk
for mortality) (35).
Interpretation of current findings
In linear risk models, we observed an overall inverse
association of plasma 25OHD with all-cause and CVD
mortality, supporting a role for low vitamin D in CVD
risk. Categorical modeling in 25OHD quartiles indicated
that the difference in risk primarily was observed be-
tween the first and second quartiles, which matched with
potential thresholds at ;42.5 nmol/L. Vitamin D suf-
ficiency is currently defined by a 25OHD concentra-
tion of $50 nmol/L, with most patients differentiated
according to optimal and suboptimal skeletal health
(1, 2). Our findings suggest that a similar threshold may
also apply to CVD risk.
However, we also observed increased risk for all-cause
mortality at particularly high plasma 25OHD concen-
trations, indicating a U-shaped relationship. Risk esti-
mates were in the same direction for CVD mortality,
albeit numerically weaker and with wider CIs. A limited
number of patients (n = 121) had very high 25OHD, and
thus these findings should be interpreted with caution.
For example, this association could result from random
variation, residual confounding, or reverse causation.
Patients with higher CVD risk or vitamin D deficiency
could be more likely to take or be prescribed higher doses
of vitamin D supplements. However, we did not find
evidence that vitamin D supplement use per se, which was
common in our sample, was associated with a higher risk
for all-cause or CVD mortality. On the contrary, sup-
plement use was associated with a lower risk for CVD
mortality. There were also no indications that participants
with high 25OHD had more severe CAD at baseline. They
appeared healthier in terms of several risk factors despite
their older age, including the level of physical activity. One
notable difference, however, was the particularly low
eGFR in patients with very high 25OHD. Detectable
concentrations of 25OHD2 in patients with high total
25OHD could be especially indicative of vitamin D sup-
plementation because of prior deficiency and therefore
further indicate the possibility for reverse causation (36).
We found that patients with detectable 25OHD2 con-
centrations were more likely to die during follow-up and
also to be slightly overrepresented in the group with
25OHD .100 nmol/L. However, it does not fully account
for the higher risk for mortality in this group.
There are concerns that statin treatment and vitamin D
status may interact, and several mechanisms in opposite
directions have been proposed (37–39). In particular, the
safety and efficacy of bolus vitamin D supplementation
have been investigated [reviewed by Glueck et al. (40)]
as a treatment of statin-associated muscle symptoms, and
it was concluded that further studies are warranted. In
our study, we did not observe that the excess risk for all-
cause or CVD mortality associated with low plasma
25OHD differed substantially by statin treatment or
other covariates. The association with plasma 25OHD .
100 nmol/L, however, differed in the sense that we ob-
served higher risk for all-cause and CVD mortality only
among statin-treated patients, although the number of
CVD deaths among patients not treated with statins was
very low. Nonetheless, the observed heterogeneity is
interesting and potentially important, but we acknowl-
edge that because this was a secondary analysis not
adjusted for multiple comparison, it may be spurious or
result from reverse causation.
Potential mechanisms
The current study supports that vitamin D status is
associated with the risk for all-cause and CVD mortality.
Vitamin D activity may affect endothelial function, fi-
brosis, and inflammation, which are processes relevant to
stenosis progression and atheromatous plaque stability
(3). However, in a previous study from the same cohort,
which was restricted to patients who underwent repeated
coronary angiography, we did not observe an association
of 25OHD with stenosis progression during ~1 year of
follow-up (41). Hence, results from the current study may
point to a mechanistic role for vitamin D status in plaque
stability rather than volume.
The current study also suggests that high vitamin D
level may be associated with excess all-cause mortality,
potentially mediated in part by increased CVD mortality
risk. Vitamin D status is relevant to the regulation of
many genes, but the main function is to maintain systemic
calcium concentrations. Genetically elevated serum cal-
cium levels were recently shown to increase the risk for
CAD and myocardial infarction (42), and vitamin D
status could play a modifying role by lowering the
threshold for safe intake of dietary calcium. An extreme
example is patients with elevated vitamin D activity due
to rare genetic mutations that reduce vitamin D catab-
olism; these patients must limit dietary intake of calcium
and vitamin D to prevent elevated calcium concentra-
tions, soft tissue calcification, and chronic kidney disease
(43). Accordingly, it is important to assess whether there

 are common genetic variants of vitamin D and calcium
metabolism that may interact with vitamin D status and
calcium intake over the life course to influence CVD risk.
A recent trial found that plasma calcium was increased in
patients with heart failure randomly assigned to vitamin
D supplementation and that they had greater need for
mechanical circulatory support implantation during
follow-up than did the placebo group (35). Although the
trial did not find an increased risk for mortality from
vitamin D supplementation, the combined results from
that trial, our study, and other observational studies
warrant concern regarding high 25OHD values in pa-
tients with pre-existing CVD. The findings remind us that
it is important to thoroughly assess the safety of long-
term vitamin D supplementation in ongoing clinical
trials.
Methodological considerations
The study design was prospective, the follow-up pe-
riod long, and the study sample large and clearly con-
fined to patients with stable SAP. We have previously
observed that patients with acute coronary syndrome
have lower concentrations of 25OHD (210 nmol/L) and
more systemic inflammation as defined by higher CRP
(.10 mg/L) than patients suspected of having SAP (41).
The inverse relationship between inflammation and
25OHD is well documented, and a CRP .20 mg/L may
render 25OHD measurements unreliable as biomarker of
vitamin D status (44). Hence, we argue that plasma
25OHD in this cohort may better reflect vitamin D status
than in cohorts with higher levels of inflammation. A
current area of investigation is the role of the different
circulating fractions of 25OHD. Free or albumin-bound
25OHD could be more easily transported through the
membrane of target cells and correlate more strongly with
vitamin D activity, and their relation to the risk for CVD
differs from the relation to total 25OHD or the fraction
bound to vitamin D binding protein (45). Given that this
is the case, the findings for total 25OHD in this study of
mostly white men might not be detected in populations
for which the fraction of protein bound 25OHD is different
(45, 46). The thresholds reported in the current study were
identified by applying a statistically reproducible method
that was previously used for the same purpose (29).
We were able to control for several potential con-
founders, but information on socioeconomic position
was not available, and physical activity was based on self-
report and was not available for all patients. We also did
not have data on the concentrations of parathyroid
hormone, which could be a mediator of vitamin D activity
in relation to CVD (22). Inability to fully include these
characteristics in statistical analyses is a limitation of
the study. Given that Mendelian randomization studies
(11–14) and randomized clinical trials (15, 16) have not
found an association between 25OHD and a lower risk
for CVD, the findings in this study and similar pro-
spective observational studies might be biased because
of residual confounding or reverse causation. Another
limitation is that patient characteristics were based on
single measurements because their validity may decrease
with longer follow-up. The Norwegian Cause of Death
Registry provided data on all-cause and CVD mortality
for all participants. Information on the cause of death in
the registry is almost exclusively based on certificates
filled out by onsite medical doctors (47). In cases where
autopsies were performed, 32% of the causes of deaths
were reclassified from one ICD-10 chapter to another;
this is a source of inaccuracy and a limitation regarding
CVD-related mortality, but not all-cause mortality (47).
Conclusions
In this observational study of white patients suspected of
having SAP, we observed an inverse association between
plasma 25OHD and the risk for CVD mortality and a
nonlinear (U-shaped) association with the risk for all-cause
mortality. Our data suggest that a potential threshold
of ~42.5 nmol/L may best discriminate between groups
with low and high risk for both outcomes, and that all-
cause mortality is also higher in the small group of patients
with concentrations . 100 nmol/L.
