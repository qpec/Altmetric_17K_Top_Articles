ABSTRACT: The revision of the eighth edition of the primary tumor, lymph node, and
metastasis (TNM) classification of the American Joint Commission of Cancer (AJCC)
for breast cancer was determined by a multidisciplinary team of breast cancer
experts. The panel recognized the need to incorporate biologic factors, such as
tumor grade, proliferation rate, estrogen and progesterone receptor expression,
human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) expression, and gene expression prognos-
tic panels into the staging system. AJCC levels of evidence and guidelines for all
tumor types were followed as much as possible. The panel felt that, to maintain
worldwide value, the tumor staging system should remain based on TNM anatomic
factors. However, the recognition of the prognostic influence of grade, hormone
receptor expression, and HER2 amplification mandated their inclusion into the stag-
ing system. The value of commercially available, gene-based assays was acknowl-
edged and prognostic input added. Tumor biomarkers and low Oncotype DX
recurrence scores can alter prognosis and stage. These updates are expected to
provide additional precision and flexibility to the staging system and were based on
the extent of published information and analysis of large, as yet unpublished data-
bases. The eighth edition of the AJCC TNM staging system, thus, provides a flexible
platform for prognostic classification based on traditional anatomic factors, which
can be modified and enhanced using patient biomarkers and multifactorial prognos-
tic panel data. The eighth edition remains the worldwide basis for breast cancer
staging and will incorporate future online updates to remain timely and relevant. CA

Practical Implications for Continuing Education
> Immunohistochemically detected tumor markers that are known to have great
practical treatment importance are now incorporated into the staging system to
refine prognosis.
> The eighth edition of the staging system also uses genomic assays when available
to downstage some estrogen receptor-positive, lymph node-negative tumors.
> Lobular carcinoma in situ is removed from the staging system because it is not
a malignancy but a risk factor. It is no longer considered Tis.
Introduction
The TNM (primary tumor [T], regional lymph nodes [N], distant metastases
[M]) staging system began in 1959 as a product of the American Joint Committee
for Cancer (AJCC) staging end results reporting.1 Changes for the eighth edition
were based on evidence available from peer-reviewed literature and on findings
from large, as yet unpublished databases and were carefully reviewed by a panel of
breast cancer experts and AJCC representatives.

 The expert panel that formulated the prior (seventh) edi-
tion of the staging manual carefully considered the intro-
duction of biomarkers to identify groups with different
molecular characteristics and different prognoses. That
panel decided that evidence in the literature then available
could not support the addition of biomarkers to the TNM
staging classification. For the eighth edition, the expert
panel concluded that the ensuing advances in clinical and
laboratory science and translational research seriously chal-
lenged the relevance of the purely anatomic TNM staging
for breast cancer. A better understanding of biologic
markers, such as estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone
receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor
2 (HER2), and their respective impact on prognosis, selec-
tion of therapy, and response to therapy warranted modifi-
cation of the TNM staging system for breast cancer.
The panel acknowledged that the clinical utility of biolog-
ic factors such as grade, hormone receptor expression, HER2
overexpression and/or amplification, and genomic panels has
become at least as important as the anatomic extent of dis-
ease to predict survival. These factors enable accurate deter-
mination of prognosis and selection of systemic therapy and
increasingly are affecting locoregional management. The
widespread use of immunohistochemical evaluation of these
markers to permit reproducible identification of their pres-
ence in tumors has greatly altered breast cancer therapy.
Although a careful review of the literature did not always
result in level I evidence to support the impact of these bio-
logic factors on prognosis, the expert panel felt that, despite
the limitations of available evidence, it was essential to incor-
porate these factors into the revision of the AJCC staging
system to remain relevant to contemporary practice.
The panel also recognized that much of the world does not
have access to reliable analysis of these factors. The anatomic
basis of the TNM staging classification is relevant worldwide,
but staging based solely on anatomic factors remains especial-
ly relevant where biological markers are not routinely avail-
able. In addition, continuing the use of anatomic TNM
staging provides continuity with the past and enables breast
cancer investigators to compare groups of patients who were
treated during different times over the last one-half century.
TNM staging also permits current investigators to communi-
cate with each other around the world using a standardized
language that reflects tumor burden.
To ensure that the cancer care community has the neces-
sary infrastructure in place for documenting eighth edition
stage, the AJCC Executive Committee—in dialogue with
the National Cancer Institute-Surveillance, Epidemiology,
and End Results program; the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention; the College of American Pathologists; the
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN); the
National Cancer Data Base; and the Commission on
Cancer—made the decision to delay implementation of the
eighth edition cancer staging system to January 1, 2018.
Clinicians will continue to use the latest information for
patient care, including scientific content of the eighth edi-
tion manual. All newly diagnosed cases through December
31, 2017 should be staged with the seventh edition. The
time extension will allow all partners to develop and update
protocols and guidelines and for software vendors to devel-
op, test, and deploy their products in time for the data col-
lection and implementation of the eighth edition in 2018.
Innovations and Changes to Traditional
Anatomic TNM
The anatomic TNM system for reporting extent of disease
continues to provide quantitative classification categories
for the primary tumor (T), regional lymph nodes (N), and
distant metastases (M), which are combined to determine
an overall stage group. Historically, the TNM anatomic
stage groups have been associated with outcome measures,
including overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival.
When applied to groups of patients, TNM staging provides
an accurate prediction of outcome. However, outcome pre-
dictions derived from groups of patients within stage
groups and subgroups are more problematic when applied
to individual patients who have different biologic subtypes
of cancers that express different biomarkers. Thus, while
anatomic TNM classifications remain the basis for the
eighth edition stage groups, tumor grade, hormone receptor
status, and HER2 status are important additional determi-
nants of outcome and are now incorporated into parallel
prognostic stage groups that recognize intrinsic tumor biol-
ogy. Despite the predictive power of intrinsic breast cancer
phenotypes, such as luminal, basal, and HER2,2 extent of
disease also offers predictive synergy. The anatomic TNM
classification provides a common language for communicat-
ing disease burden. Over time, the definitions for classifica-
tion have required modification, particularly to accommodate
additional subclasses of earlier stage breast cancers that are
diagnosed with increasing frequency among women who
undergo mammographic screening. The eighth edition
of the staging manual has continued this evolution and fur-
ther refined and clarified the definitions for T, N, and
M. Table 1 summarizes the significant changes to the
TNM classification.
Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) has been removed from
the staging classification system and is no longer included in
the pathologic tumor in situ (pTis) category. LCIS is treated
as a benign entity with an associated risk for developing car-
cinoma in the future but not as a malignancy capable of
metastases. There is a small subset of LCIS that has high-
grade nuclear features and may exhibit central necrosis. This
subset has been referred to as pleomorphic LCIS and has

AJCC anatomic and
prognostic stage groups
There are 2 stage group tables presented in this chapter:
II
1. The anatomic stage group table is based solely on anatomic extent of cancer as defined by the
T, N, and M categories.
2. The prognostic stage group table is based on populations of persons with breast cancer that
have been offered—and mostly treated with—appropriate endocrine and/or systemic chemotherapy,
which includes anatomic T, N, and M plus tumor grade and the status of the biomarkers human
epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), estrogen receptor (ER), and progesterone receptor (PR).
Selecting the appropriate
stage group table
The prognostic stage group table is preferred for patient care and is to be used for reporting of all
cancer patients in the United States.
The anatomic stage group table is provided so that stage can be assigned in regions of the world
where the biomarkers cannot be routinely obtained.
N/A
Definition of primary
tumor (T)
Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) is removed as a pathologic tumor in situ (pTis) category for T
categorization. LCIS is a benign entity and is removed from TNM staging.
I
Definition of primary
tumor (T)
The general rules for rounding to the nearest millimeter do not apply for tumors between 1.0 and
1.5 mm, so that these cancers are not classified as microinvasive (T1mi) carcinomas (defined as
invasive tumor foci 1.0 mm or smaller). Tumors > 1 mm and < 2 mm should be reported rounding to
2 mm.
II
Definition of primary
tumor (T)
It is confirmed that the maximum invasive tumor size (T) is a reasonable estimate of tumor volume.
Small, microscopic satellite foci of tumor around the primary tumor do not appreciably alter tumor
volume and are not added to the maximum tumor size.
I
Definition of primary
tumor (T)
The T categorization of multiple synchronous tumors is clarified. These are identified clinically and/or
by macroscopic pathologic examination, and their presence documented using the (m) modifier for
the T category. This new edition specifically continues using only the maximum dimension of the
largest tumor for clinical (cT) and pathological (pT) T classification; the size of multiple tumors is
not added.
I
Definition of primary
tumor (T)
A clear definition is added that satellite tumor nodules in the skin must be separate from the
primary tumor and macroscopically identified to categorize as T4b. Skin and dermal tumor satellite
nodules identified only on microscopic examination and in the absence of epidermal ulceration or
skin edema (clinical peau d’orange) do not qualify as T4b. Such tumors should be categorized based
on tumor size.
I
Definition of regional
lymph node (N)
The criteria for pathological measurement of lymph node metastases are clearly defined. The
dimension of the area containing several or multiple tumor deposits is NOT used to determine
pathological N (pN) category. The largest contiguous tumor deposit is used for pN; adjacent satellite
tumor deposits are not added.
I
Definition of regional
lymph node (N)
The expert panel affirmed that cNX is not a valid category unless the lymph node basin has been
removed and cannot be examined by imaging or clinical examination; a cN0 category is to be
assigned when any evaluation of the lymph nodes is possible and the physical examination or
imaging examination is negative.
I
Definition of distant
metastasis (M)
The expert panel affirmed that pM0 is not a valid category. All cases should be categorized as
either cM0 or cM1; however, if cM1 is subsequently microscopically confirmed, pM1 is used (see
Chapter 1 as well)
I
Postneoadjuvant therapy
classification (ypTNM)
The expert panel clarified that the postneoadjuvant therapy pathological T category (ypT) is based
on the largest focus of residual tumor, if present. Treatment-related fibrosis adjacent to residual
invasive carcinoma is not included in the ypT maximum dimension. When multiple foci of residual
tumor are present, the (m) modifier is included. The pathology report should include a description
of the extent of residual tumor explaining the basis for the ypT categorization and, when possible,
also should document the pretreatment cT category.
I
Postneoadjuvant therapy
classification (ypTNM)
The expert panel clarified that the largest focus of residual tumor in the lymph nodes, if present, is
used for ypN categorization. Treatment-related fibrosis adjacent to residual lymph node tumor
deposits is not included in the ypN dimension and classification.
I
Complete pathological
response
The expert panel affirmed that any residual invasive carcinoma detected by pathological examination
in the breast or lymph nodes precludes posttreatment classification as a complete pathological
response (pCR). If a cancer is categorized M1 (clinical or pathological) prior to therapy, the cancer
is categorized as M1 after neoadjuvant therapy, regardless of the observed response to therapy.
I
Collection of biomarkers
(hormone receptor assays
and HER2 assay)
The expert panel determined that all invasive carcinomas should have ER, PR, and HER2 status
determined by appropriate assays whenever possible.

 histologic features that partially overlap the features of ductal
carcinoma in situ (DCIS), including the potential to develop
calcifications detectable by mammography. The expert panel
debated whether to include this variant of LCIS in the pTis
category; however, there are insufficient data in the literature
regarding outcomes and reproducible diagnostic criteria for
this LCIS variant. Cases exhibiting DCIS and LCIS are
classified as pTis (DCIS). The only other Tis category, pTis
(Paget), is for pure Paget disease without any underlying
DCIS or invasive carcinoma.
The seventh edition staging manual included rules for
rounding tumor size to the nearest millimeter. This was
problematic for microinvasive carcinoma of the breast. The
eighth edition manual explicitly defines microinvasive path-
ologic T1 tumors (pT1mi) as those measuring � 1.0 mm
and clarifies that tumors between 1.0 and 1.5 mm should be
rounded up to 2.0 mm (pT1a). Table 2 lists the primary
tumor size (T) classifications.
The eighth edition manual affirms that the TNM system
for breast carcinoma is an estimate of total tumor volume;
however, there are no easily applied and reproducible meth-
ods for calculating total primary tumor volume. The expert
panel reaffirmed that the maximum tumor dimension is the
best surrogate for volume and that additional small foci of
tumor do not substantially alter the overall volume of tumor
relative to the maximum dimension of the largest focus of
tumor. Small satellite foci of microscopic tumor surround-
ing the main tumor mass do not alter the size or T classifi-
cation of the tumor. Following similar principles, when
synchronous tumors are present, the size of the largest
tumor focus is used for T classification; the tumor sizes are
not added.3 Multifocal tumors are identified clinically or by
macroscopic pathologic evaluation and are designated with
the (m) modifier. A synchronous 1.5-cm and 0.6-cm
tumor, for example, would be classified as pT1c(m). Gener-
ally, incidentally identified microscopic tumors in proximity
to the main tumor mass would be considered satellite foci;
however, occasionally, a synchronous invasive tumor may
be macroscopically missed in a large excision or mastectomy
specimen. In these situations, clinical judgment should be
exercised, and it would be permissible to use the (m) modi-
fier, particularly when the tumors have different histology,
grade, or prognostic receptor status. The size of each mac-
roscopic focus of tumor should be verified microscopically
and compared with clinical and imaging dimensions to
assist in establishing the best T classification. The new
manual adds a clear definition indicating that satellite
tumor nodules in the skin must be separate from the prima-
ry tumor and macroscopically identified to be classified as
T4b. Skin and dermal tumor satellite nodules identified only
on microscopic examination and in the absence of skin ulcera-
tion or skin edema (clinical peau d’orange) do not qualify as
T4b.4 In contrast, inflammatory carcinoma classified as T4d is
primarily a clinical diagnosis based on diffuse erythema or
edema of one-third or more of the breast. The expert panel
discussed but did not create a specific T classification for the
rare examples where there is clear evidence for the presence of
invasive carcinoma but a primary breast invasive carcinoma

 was not identified. Examples of evidence of invasion include a
lymph node with metastatic carcinoma or definitive lymphat-
ic vascular invasion (LVI) in the breast without identification
of definitive invasive carcinoma in the breast or only DCIS
in the breast. In these situations, the T classification is pT0
or pTis (DCIS), as appropriate, and a comment should be
added to the report indicating that the positive lymph node
or LVI is evidence that invasive carcinoma is present but was
not identified. These situations should prompt thorough
attempts to identify a primary invasive carcinoma using addi-
tional pathologic, clinical, or imaging evaluation. Additional
discussion of this situation can be found in Chapter 1 of the
eighth edition manual.5
The expert panel did not recommend any major changes
to N classification in the new edition of the staging manual
(Table 3). However, the criteria for pathologic measurement
of lymph node metastases are now more clearly defined. The
dimension of the area containing several or multiple tumor
deposits is not used to determine the pathologic lymph node
(pN) category. The largest contiguous tumor deposit is used
for pN; adjacent tumor deposits are not added together. In
distinguishing pN0 tumors with lymph nodes containing
isolated tumor cells (pN0[i1]) and pN1mi from other N
categories, the clarifications follow the same principles out-
lined above for T classification, and estimates of tumor
burden based on maximum size of the largest focus of tumor
are used to estimate total tumor volume. The new manual
incorporates supplemental figures that reinforce the concept
that isolated tumor cell (ITC) clusters and micrometastases
are more likely to be present as multiple tumor deposits,
either in proximity to one another or dispersed in different
locations within the lymph node, rather than as single tumor
deposits. Only the size of the largest tumor deposit within a
lymph node is used to classify that node, and the collective
summary of all lymph nodes is used to determine the final N
classification. For example, a lymph node with at least one
tumor deposit >2.0 mm that also contains a few scattered
micrometastases and ITC clusters would only be tabulated as
a lymph node with a macrometastasis. If the patient had one
additional involved lymph node with the largest tumor
deposit qualifying as a micrometastasis and 2 additional
involved lymph nodes with ITCs only, the 4 positive lymph
nodes would be tabulated as 1 macrometastasis, 1 microme-
tastasis, and 2 ITCs, and the overall N classification would
be pN1a. In other words, the tabulation of positive lymph
nodes recognizes only the largest tumor deposit in each
lymph node; and the sum of the tabulation of macrometasta-
ses, micrometastases, and ITCs is equivalent to the total
number of lymph nodes containing metastatic tumor depos-
its. Lymph nodes with ITCs only are tabulated in the report

 but do not contribute to overall N classification; the above
example would not be considered pN2a. The new manual
also clarifies that cNX is a category that should be rarely
used and is generally not valid. A classification of cN0 should
be used except in the rare event that the regional lymph
node basin has been removed and cannot be evaluated by
clinical or imaging examination. The expert panel considered
but decided not to incorporate the lymph node ratio (LNR)
as an alternative method for N classification and recognized
that, when modest numbers of lymph nodes are removed for
pathologic evaluation, the LNR performs as well or better
than total positive lymph nodes for outcome prediction.6–9
However, when only a few lymph nodes are removed, which
commonly occurs with sentinel lymph node biopsy, the
LNR can perform worse than total positive lymph nodes and
may be misleading.
The eighth edition manual clarifies the use of M classifi-
cation codes but does not make any changes to the M clas-
sification definitions (Table 4). The expert panel affirmed
that pM0 is not a valid category, and all cases should be
classified as cM0 or cM1. If cM1 is subsequently confirmed
by pathologic examination, then pM1 is appropriate. A
benign biopsy of a clinically suspicious lesion also does not
indicate classification as pM0, because it does not guarantee
the absence of metastatic lesions elsewhere. A classification
of cM0(i1) is used if there is no clinical or imaging evi-
dence of distant disease but there is molecular or micro-
scopic evidence of circulating tumor cells or disseminated
tumor cell deposits no larger than 0.2 mm in bone marrow
or other nonregional lymph nodes. Table 5 illustrates the
TNM anatomic stages.
Several clarifications of the postneoadjuvant therapy path-
ologic T classification (ypT) have been included in the new
manual. When residual tumor is present in the breast, the
largest focus of viable-appearing, residual tumor is used for
ypT classification; treatment-related fibrosis or necrotic-
appearing tumor around or adjacent to residual tumor is not
included in the maximum dimension. When multiple foci of
viable residual tumor are present, the (m) modifier should be
appended to the ypT classification. When residual lymph
node disease is present, the size of the largest focus of residu-
al tumor is used to determine the ypN classification, and
treatment-associated fibrosis is not included, analogous to
the ypT classification. The pathology report should include a
description of the residual tumor in the breast and regional
lymph nodes that explains the basis of the ypT and ypN clas-
sifications; when possible, the report should also include the
pretreatment cT and cN classifications. The expert panel
affirmed that any residual, invasive tumor detected by patho-
logical examination in the breast or regional lymph nodes
precludes classification as a complete pathologic response.
The finding of residual DCIS after neoadjuvant therapy is
classified as ypTis. The expert panel discussed the situation
in which the only residual disease detected is tumor within
lymphatic vascular channels (LVI). Although there is no
specific ypT classification for this situation, and there is no
comprehensive outcome analysis for this event, it would not
currently be considered a pathologic complete response.
Regardless of response to therapy, if a cancer is classified
pathologically or clinically as M1 before neoadjuvant thera-
py, then the cancer is classified M1 after therapy.
The Incorporation of Biologic Factors Into
AJCC Stage
The issue of incorporating biologic factors to include tumor
grade, expression of hormone receptors and HER2, as well
as multigene prognostic and predictive panels into staging
was carefully reviewed and extensively deliberated by the
breast expert panel. For the eighth edition, the breast expert
panel concluded that the progress in biology, diagnostics,
and therapeutics made incorporation of biology into the
current staging system mandatory, recognizing the com-
plexities and limitations involved. Clinicians often commu-
nicate with each other using biologic factors as well as
TNM. For example, a colleague might say, “The patient
has a T1N0M0, high-grade, triple-negative cancer.”
The earliest prognostic biologic factor recognized by
pathologists was tumor differentiation. Simply stated, this
is how close or far from normal breast tissue a tumor
appears microscopically. Tumors that closely resemble nor-
mal tissue are well differentiated, and those that are far
from normal are poorly differentiated. Normal breast
lobules are comprised of cells with round, regular nuclei
arranged in well-formed glands or tubules, and with very
few dividing cells. Today, the evaluation of these 3 factors
has been standardized by the Nottingham group.10,11 Each
of the 3 factors—nuclear pleomorphism, gland or tubule

 formation, and dividing cells or mitotic activity—is given a
score from 1 to 3 (with 1 being the closest to normal). The
scores are added and, if the combined tumor score is
between 3 and 5, it is well differentiated or grade 1. If the
combined score is 6 or 7, it is grade 2; and, if the combined
score is 8 or 9, it is poorly differentiated or grade 3. The
expert panel decided to incorporate Nottingham tumor
grade in conjunction with other biomarkers, multigene
assays, and panels to modify the assigned TNM stage.
The majority of available data regarding biomarkers and
prognostic and predictive multigene panels are retrospective
in nature and are confounded by the lack of a “no-
treatment” control group of patients. With respect to bio-
markers, large databases with complete data and adequate
follow-up have not been available, largely because HER2
status was not routinely recorded by tumor registries until
2010. There are now data showing the value of incorporat-
ing biologic factors with TNM anatomic staging to refine
prognostic categories in patients with breast cancer. In a
study from The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer
Center (MD Anderson) that included 3728 patients who
were treated between 1997 and 2006, investigators developed
a staging system that incorporated grade and ER status with
pathologic stage to facilitate improved stratification with
respect
to
disease-specific
survival
(DSS)
compared
with pathologic stage alone.12 This was validated with 26,711
patients from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End
Results database. One important caveat of that work is that
it predated the routine use of trastuzumab for patients with
HER2-positive breast cancer. The investigators subsequently
updated these analyses with a cohort of 3327 patients treated
at MD Anderson from 2007 to 2013. That cohort included
306 patients (9.2%) with HER2-positive breast cancer, the
majority of whom received trastuzumab. In this updated—
although as yet unpublished—analysis, the inclusion of
HER2 status, along with grade, ER status, and AJCC path-
ologic stage, further refined patient stratification with respect
to DSS (E.A. Mittendorf, personal communication). These
findings were validated using a cohort of 67,944 patients
identified in the California Cancer Registry. The studies
from MD Anderson included patients who received multi-
disciplinary treatment that included appropriate adjuvant
systemic therapy and anti-HER2 agents, thus confirming
the prognostic significance of biologic factors in appropriate-
ly treated patients.
Additional work from the MD Anderson group was dis-
cussed extensively by the breast expert panel while revisions
of the AJCC staging system were ongoing. Data from the
MD Anderson study of patients treated between 2007 and
2013 (n 5 3327) were used to determine a risk profile and
assign a score (Bioscore) to alter patient’s stage. The MD
Anderson staging system assigned points for each biologic
factor and TNM pathologic stage with the number of
points resulting in a Bioscore ranging from 0 to 4 based on
the hazard ratio magnitude determined on multivariate
analysis (Table 6). A patient would be determined to have a
Bioscore ranging from 0 to 7 with a corresponding DSS of
100% to 33% (Table 7). Briefly, this system considers grade,
ER status, and HER2 status. No points are assigned for
grade 1 or2 tumors, ER-positive tumors, or HER2-positive
tumors. One point is assigned for grade 3 tumors, ER-negative
tumors, and HER2-negative tumors. Therefore, a risk-profile
Bioscore from 0 to 3 is calculated. Within each TNM stage,
the risk Bioscore can be used to further stratify patients.

aThe Anatomic Stage Group table should only be used in global regions
where biomarker tests are not routinely available. Cancer registries in the
United States must use the Prognostic Stage Group table for case reporting.
bNotes for Anatomic Stage Grouping:
� T1 includes micrometastases (T1mi).
� T0 and T1 tumors with lymph node micrometastases only are excluded from
stage IIA and are classified as stage IB.
� M0 includes M0 with isolated tumor cells (i1).
� The designation pM0 is not valid; any M0 is clinical.
� If a patient presents with M1 disease before neoadjuvant systemic therapy,
then the stage is stage IV and remains stage IV regardless of response to
neoadjuvant therapy.
� Stage designation may be changed if postsurgical imaging studies reveal the
presence of distant metastases, provided the studies are performed within 4
months of diagnosis in the absence of disease progression and provided the
patient has not received neoadjuvant therapy.
� Staging after neoadjuvant therapy is denoted with a “yc” or “yp” prefix to
the T and N classification. No stage group is assigned if there is a complete
pathological response (pCR) to neoadjuvant therapy: for example,
ypT0ypN0cM0.

CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians
 For example, a patient with an anatomic stage IIB tumor
that is grade 1, ER-positive, and HER2-negative would
have a risk-profile score of 1 with a corresponding 5-year
DSS rate of 97% and a 5-year OS rate of 95% in contrast to
a patient with an anatomic stage IIB tumor that is grade 3,
ER-negative, and HER2-negative, who would have a risk-
profile score of 3 with 5-year DSS and OS rates of 92%.
This risk-profile study was limited by the relatively small
cohort in which the profile was developed. Although such
a point-based staging system would perhaps improve stag-
ing accuracy, it would represent a complex departure from
traditional TNM anatomic staging. The expert panel felt
that validation in a larger cohort would be required before
the risk profile could be considered for incorporation into
AJCC staging; however, its data strongly support the
incorporation of biomarkers into the TNM staging
system.
There was a strong consensus among panel members
that anatomic stage groups be maintained, as they could
be applied to all patients with breast cancer worldwide,
regardless of the availability of biomarker analysis or
multigene assays. This recommendation acknowledged that
there are many countries where biomarker assays and mul-
tigene panels are not routinely used, often because of the
lack of resources to pay for such testing. Although anatomic
staging has changed over the years, it still can be used as a
link to the past for comparison of studies and patient popu-
lations as well as a common terminology for physicians
regardless of country or available resources.
To address the importance of tumor biology, in addition
to defining AJCC anatomic stage groups, the breast expert
panel has defined biologic factor-based prognostic stage
groups for the eighth edition that take into consideration
tumor grade; HER2, ER, and PR status; and multigene
panel (such as Oncotype DX) status. The incorporation of
tumor grade and ER, PR, and HER2 status was deter-
mined based in part on an unpublished analysis performed
by Dr. David J. Winchester, an expert panel member, using
data from 238,265 women diagnosed with invasive breast
cancer in 2010 who were included in the National Cancer
Database. The analyses used conventional AJCC T, N, and
M categories as well as tumor grade and ER, PR, and

 HER2 status to define prognostic subgroups. In the eighth
edition, patients with triple-negative tumors, regardless of
grade, have survival comparable to that of patients with dis-
ease one stage higher than those who have tumors express-
ing either HER2, ER, or PR. Similarly, patients with grade
3 tumors that are HER2-negative and positive for either
ER or PR also have survival comparable to that of patients
with disease one stage higher than those with tumors of a
lower grade. This is supported by the analysis of Dr. David
J. Winchester (personal communication), which is similar
to findings of single-institution studies.12,13 Table 8 illus-
illustrates examples of the effect of grade and biomarkers
on selected seventh edition TNM stage groups.
As stated above, the eighth edition prognostic stage
groups also take into consideration multigene panel testing.
Recently, early results from prospective clinical trials have
begun to emerge, and the value of multigene panels for
managing patients has progressed to the point where such
panels are routinely incorporated into national guidelines
and recommendations for treatment.14,15 A few recent pub-
lications and abstracts have reported outcome data relative
to multigene panel test results, although with limited fol-
low up of only 3 to 5 years. Although the expert panel does
not endorse any particular assay, the multigene panel used
in the majority of these studies was the 21-gene Oncotype
DX recurrence score,16–20 whereas one study used the
70-gene MammaPrint in conjunction with Adjuvant!
Online.21,22 Table 9 summarizes 5-year outcome data from
studies using multigene panels to define low-risk patients
who were treated predominantly without systemic chemo-
therapy.16–19,21 For such low-risk patients, downstaging to
stage I based on biology is supported by the consistently
low 5-year risk of recurrence. The major impact of a multi-
gene panel in the eighth edition prognostic stage grouping
is the downstaging of biologically low-risk T2 N0 from
stage II to stage I for tumors with a low Oncotype DX
recurrence score. This change in staging is supported by
currently reported studies consistently demonstrating a very
low risk of recurrence at 3 to 5 years in the low-risk sub-
group of patients, as selected by low-risk biology deter-
mined by multigene panels. Caveats include only 3-year to
5-year results reported, differing clinical selection criteria,
differing treatments used, differing molecular profiling
tools used, and differing cutoff points used for selecting the
low-risk subgroup of patients. As of this time, no upstaging
is recommended based on multigene panel testing. Table
8 shows the impact of gene panels with Oncotype DX
recurrence scores <11 on selected TNM stages from the
seventh edition.

Updates to the AJCC Breast TNM Staging System: The 8th Edition
10
CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians
 It should be noted that Oncotype DX is the only multi-
gene panel included in the prognostic stage group table of
the eighth edition, because it is supported by level 1 data.
In addition, it is a strong recommendation of the expert
panel that prognostic and predictive markers should not be
used as part of the staging system without knowledge of
basic tumor markers (ER, PR, and HER2) as a necessary
prerequisite. A second recommendation is that multigene
panels would be incorporated into the staging system only
for selected subsets of breast cancer (eg, hormone receptor-
positive, HER2-negative, tone-half, lymph node-negative).
Third, multigene panels currently in clinical use may simply
represent a substitute for measuring proliferation. The Ki-
67 labeling index as a single marker of proliferation was not
considered sufficiently reliable to add to staging because of
its known lack of reproducibility, especially between differ-
ent laboratories, as well as the lack of agreement on an opti-
mal cutoff point.14,23
The staging complexity of this new edition is clearly
increased by the addition of contemporary multigene expression
panels. The US Food and Drug Administration has approved
for clinical use a panel for women younger than 61 years with
TNM stage I or II lymph node-negative breast cancer. In addi-
tion, the Tumor Marker Guidelines Committee of the Ameri-
can Society of Clinical Oncology has recommended that a
second multigene panel based on expression of 21 genes, as
determined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reac-
tion, “may be used” to determine prognosis for patients with
ER-positive breast cancer and tumor-free lymph nodes who
will be treated with tamoxifen systemic therapy. The Breast
Cancer Guideline Committee of the National Comprehen-
sive Cancer Network (NCCN) has stated that using genomic
and gene-expression arrays that also incorporate prognostic/
predictive biomarkers like the Oncotype Dx recurrence score
may provide prognostic and predictive information in addi-
tion to anatomic staging and ER/PR and HER2 status. Clin-
ical validation of these assays is accumulating, supporting
their use as prognostic and predictive tools and leading to this
modification of the staging system for breast cancer.
The incorporation of biomarkers and multigene panels
into the eighth edition AJCC staging system allows for
more refined staging that reflects the prognostic and pre-
dictive significance of biologic factors. The expert panel
realizes that not all oncologists use biomarker assays, and
this could result in staging disparities. However, many
oncologists do, and the NCCN guidelines recognize their
use. The incorporation of multigene panels with the Onco-
type DX or any gene panel creates its own problems. Some
clinicians may decide not to order the test because of the
patient’s comorbidities or finances. This could result in a

 staging discrepancy based on physician choice or even
socioeconomic reasons. The panel clearly recognizes this
problem; however, because the multigene assays are incor-
porated into national guidelines, it seems appropriate to
recognize their undisputed value. The expert panel antici-
pates that biomarker utilization will continue to increase
and believes that this initial effort in incorporating biology
into staging was critical in maintaining the clinical rele-
vance of the staging system. It is anticipated that future
modifications based on biology will undoubtedly be needed
with the reporting of additional outcome studies with dif-
ferent panels and longer follow-up, particularly as prospec-
tively designed studies mature.
Conclusion
The eighth edition of the AJCC staging system for breast
cancer is based on the anatomy-based and histology-based
original TNM staging system and uses the addition of vari-
ous biomarkers to refine the prognostic information for
better selection of therapy with improved outcome. It is
now possible to identify a group of patients who have invasive
breast cancer with a prognosis so favorable that they may for-
go systemic chemotherapy. The ability to predict benefit from
or resistance to specific treatments is of major clinical rele-
vance. The eighth edition expert panel formulated their rec-
ommendations before the publication of an additional
prospective randomized study using a 70-gene signature
(MammaPrint) to evaluate the impact of chemotherapy on
women deemed to be at high risk of metastases because of
clinical factors but found to be at low genomic risk based on
their 70-gene assay.24 This MINDACT study showed that
women at low genomic risk who, despite their high clinical
risk, did not receive adjuvant systemic chemotherapy had a
high 5-year survival similar to that of patients who received
chemotherapy. Although these data were not available for
inclusion in the eighth edition of the AJCC staging manual,
they are consistent with the recommendation of the expert
panel for downstaging selected tumors with low-risk genomic
profiling to stage I and will be incorporated in the future.
To preserve the relevance of anatomic staging for the
entire world where such markers may not be available, the
panel elected to integrate biomarkers as a second tier of
prognostic modifiers similar to the use by expert panels
evaluating other disease sites within the AJCC manual.
The purely anatomic staging system provides clinicians
throughout the world the ability to determine an anatomic
stage and confers historical relevance to the current staging
system. Most cancer deaths are not in developed countries,
and ignoring anatomic staging would be detrimental to the
well being of patients in developing countries.
The rapid expansion of knowledge of the biology of
breast cancer is likely to lead to frequent online modifica-
tions of the eighth edition staging system as peer-reviewed,
validated information becomes available. The eighth edi-
tion of the AJCC staging manual is intended to be relevant
for the present and adaptable for the future but will remain
firmly anchored to the past. �
