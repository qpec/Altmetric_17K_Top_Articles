Tattoos, piercing, and scarification are now commonplace among 
adolescents and young adults. This first clinical report from the American 
Academy of Pediatrics on voluntary body modification will review the 
methods used to perform the modifications. Complications resulting from 
body modification methods, although not common, are discussed to provide 
the pediatrician with management information. Body modification will be 
contrasted with nonsuicidal self-injury. When available, information also is 
presented on societal perceptions of body modification.
abstract
Tattoos, piercings, and scarification, also known as “body modifications, 
”  
are commonly obtained by adolescents and young adults. Previous 
reports on those who obtain tattoos, piercings, and scarification have 
focused mainly on high-risk populations, including at-risk adolescents.1 
Tattooing and piercing of various body parts no longer is a high-risk–
population phenomenon, as evidenced by growing numbers of adults and 
adolescents not considered at risk who have tattoos and multiple ear and 
body piercings. The Pew Research Center reports that in 2010, 38% of  
18 to 29 year olds had at least 1 tattoo, and 23% had piercings in locations 
other than an earlobe.2 Of those with tattoos, 72% were covered and not 
visible.2 Scarification is the practice of intentionally irritating the skin to 
cause a permanent pattern of scar tissue; data are not currently available 
on the prevalence of scarification in the United States.
Although body modifications have become a mainstream trend, 
they still may be associated with medical complications and, among 
adolescents, may also co-occur with high-risk behaviors. This first 
clinical report from the American Academy of Pediatrics on tattooing, 
piercing, and scarification discusses the history of these methods of body 
modification, educates the reader on methods used, reports on trends 
in associated adolescent and young adult risk behaviors, differentiates 
between nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) and body modifications, and 
educates the reader about how to anticipate and prevent potential 
medical complications. The report analyzes the literature about societal 
acceptance of people with body modifications and perceptions that

HIsTOry Of BODy MODIfIcaTIOn: 
TaTTOOIng, PIercIng, anD 
scarIfIcaTIOn
Although interest in body 
modification has increased 
recently, history teaches us that 
body modifications are not new. 
Archeologists have found evidence of 
tattoos, piercings, and scarification as 
far back as 2000 BC, when they were 
largely used as a form of art or to 
identify group membership, such as 
a religious group or tribe. Although 
mostly used to describe loyalty, 
interests, and lifestyle choices, body 
modification had also been used to 
label criminals, slaves, and convicts.3
Although in the late 20th century, 
most tattoos were on men, ranging 
from the stereotypical tattooed 
sailors and motorcycle bikers (eg, 
The Hells Angels in the 1960s) 
to 1980s gang members, now, 
tattoos are collections of colorful 
ornamentations for both women and 
men. Surveys of the US population 
have shown an increase in the 
prevalence of tattoos over time.4, 
 
5
ePIDeMIOlOgy
Harris Poll data from 2016 found that 
3 in 10 US adults had at least 1 tattoo, 
up from 20% in 2012.6 Differences 
were found by geographic region, 
with tattoos being more prevalent 
in the West (27%) versus the East 
(28%), Midwest (27%), and South 
(32%).6 Tattoos were also more 
prevalent among adults in their 30s 
compared with those younger and 
older, 
6 although another national 
probability sample of adults found 
higher tattoo rates among younger 
versus older cohorts.4 Evidence on 
sex differences in tattooing also 
varies, with tattoo prevalence among 
women ranging from 22% to 23% 
and prevalence among men ranging 
from 19% to 26%.4, 
 
6 Among those 
with a tattoo, most (86%) have 
never regretted getting one, and 
30% said it makes them feel sexier. 
Other feelings attributed to having 
a tattoo included feeling rebellious 
(25%), attractive or strong (21%), 
spiritual (16%), healthier (9%), more 
intelligent (8%), and athletic (5%).6
Estimates of tattooing and piercing 
among adolescents range by data 
source and age group. One early 
study among high school students 
from 8 states found that 10% had 
tattoos, and 55% expressed interest 
in tattooing.7 In this sample, tattoos 
were commonly obtained around the 
ninth grade, but there were reports 
of tattooing as early as age 8 years.7 
Among adolescent clinic samples of 
youth 12 to 22 years of age, tattooing 
ranged from 10% to 23%, and body 
piercing (other than the earlobe) 
ranged from 27% to 42%, 
8, 
 
9 with 
higher rates of tattooing and body 
piercing among girls versus boys and 
older versus younger adolescents.8, 
 
9 
Harris Poll data revealed that 22% of 
youth 18 to 24 years of age reported 
having a tattoo, 
6 but estimates were 
as high as 38% among young people 
18 to 29 years of age on the basis of 
Pew Research Center findings.2
Findings are comparable among 
subsequent samples of private 
university and college students, of 
whom 23% had a tattoo and 51% had 
a body piercing.10, 
 
11 Male athletes 
were more likely to be tattooed 
than male nonathletes, and although 
women were more likely to have 
a piercing than men, there was no 
difference by sex for tattooing.10, 
 
11 Of 
students with current piercings, high-
ear cartilage (53%) was the most 
common visible piercing, followed 
by navel (38%), tongue (13%), and 
nipple and genital (9%) piercings.
A survey conducted among college 
freshmen from Italy found that many 
students undergoing tattooing and/
or piercing were unaware of the 
associated health risks.12 Although 
most (60%) students knew about 
HIV-related risks, less than half 
knew about possible infection 
with hepatitis C (38%), hepatitis 
B (34%), tetanus (34%), or about 
noninfectious complications (28%).12 
These findings have similarly been 
reported in a sample of medical 
students who had undergone 
piercing.13
Scarification is the practice of 
intentionally irritating the skin to 
cause a permanent pattern of scar 
tissue. Studies have been conducted 
among international communities 
describing high rates of scarification, 
yet no studies on scarification have 
been reported from the United 
States.14, 
 
15 In the 1990s and 2000s, 
there was some renewed interest in 
scarification as a movement to revive 
indigenous rituals from around the 
world, embracing a more authentic 
or spiritual body experience.16
DeclInIng sTrengTH Of 
assOcIaTIOns WITH rIsk BeHavIOrs
Although in the past, body 
modification was often associated 
with adolescent high-risk behaviors, 
current data have not consistently 
reported this association. In a 
retrospective analysis from 2007 to 
2008, tattoos were associated with 
alcohol and drug use, violence and 
weapons carrying, sexual activity, 
eating disorders, and suicide.17 
However, the scientific link between 
tattooing and risk behaviors is 
less consistent today.1 As with any 
adolescent or young adult, for those 
with piercings and tattoos, it is 
advised that the pediatrician conduct 
a careful adolescent psychosocial 
history with targeted behavioral

BODy MODIfIcaTIOn Is nOT nssI
It is important to be able to 
distinguish normal body modification 
from body modification that is 
more dramatic or intense as part of 
NSSI syndrome, which is described 
in the Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth 
Edition as follows: “over the past 
year, the person has for at least 5 
days engaged in self-injury with the 
anticipation that the injury will result 
in some bodily harm without suicidal 
intent.” 
19
NSSI differs from body modification 
because NSSI often is impulsive or 
compulsive and may be associated 
with mental health disorders, 
including psychotic disorders, 
personality disorders, and anxiety 
disorders.20 Estimated prevalence 
rates for NSSI in 2008 for adolescents 
were between 14% and 24%. It can 
include cutting, scratching, burning, 
and hitting oneself. Individuals who 
hurt themselves report injuries to 
many different body parts.21 The 
individual who engages in self-injury 
expects to get relief from a negative 
emotion, deal with a personal issue, 
or create a positive feeling.19
Importantly, NSSI is clinically 
concerning because of an association 
with mental health disorders, 
whereas body modification such 
as tattooing, piercing, and/or 
scarification does not have these 
associations and is more socially 
acceptable.19 Intention is the most 
important differentiator and can 
be discerned with careful clinical 
interviewing.18

Public opinion of the relationship 
between having a tattoo and deviant 
behavior is changing. In 2008, 
among those with and without 
tattoos, 29% believed that people 
with tattoos were more likely to do 
something most people consider 
deviant, whereas 24% believed 
this in 2012.6 From another survey 
regarding technological and social 
changes, 40% of respondents said 
that more people getting tattoos has 
been a change for the worse, 45% 
of respondents said that it has made 
no difference, and only 7% said this 
has been a change for the better. As 
might be expected, older Americans 
are far more likely to negatively view 
this trend; 64% of those 65 years 
and older and 51% of those 50 to 
64 years of age said more people 
getting tattoos has been a change 
for the worse. A majority of those 
younger than 50 years (56%) said the 
tattoo trend has not made much of a 
difference.22
The age differences are larger among 
women than men. Of women aged 
50 years and older, ∼6 in 10 (61%) 
said more people getting tattoos 
have been a change for the worse, 
compared with 27% of younger 
women. The gap is smaller among 
men; 51% of men aged 50 years 
and older said more people getting 
tattoos has been a change for the 
worse, compared with 30% of 
younger men.2
Although societal acceptance of 
tattoos and piercings has increased, 
there still may be repercussions 
when seeking employment or  
educational opportunities. In a  
2014 survey of nearly 2700 people, 
76% thought that tattoos and/or 
piercings had hurt their chances 
of getting a job, and 39% thought 
employees with tattoos and/or 
piercings reflect poorly on their 
employers.23 One executive career 
coach wrote that 37% of human 
resource managers cite tattoos as the 
third physical attribute likely to limit 
career potential (nonear piercings 
and bad breath were the top 2).24, 
 
25  
Consequently, adolescents and 
young adults contemplating body 
modification may be well advised to 
make sure that the tattoo or piercing 
is not visible in typical work attire.

Methods
A multitude of videos on YouTube 
and other Internet video repositories 
exist for the reader to view and learn 
about safe and acceptable methods 
of tattoo placement. After selecting 
or designing the art to be transferred 
via tattoo, it is stenciled or drawn 
on the skin. The skin is cleansed 
with antiseptic, and a thin layer of 
ointment (such as petroleum jelly) 
is placed on the site. Professional 
tattoo artists use a motorized, 
electric–powered machine that holds 
needles and can puncture the skin 
up to several thousand times per 
minute. The needles are dipped into 
the ink and then puncture the skin at 
a depth of a few millimeters, where 
the pigment reaches the dermis layer. 
Any blood or serosanguineous fluid 
is wiped away during the procedure. 
After completion, another antiseptic 
is applied, and the tattoo is covered. 
After 24 hours, the dressing is 
removed and the tattoo remains open 
to air, and the skin is kept moist by 
applying antibiotic ointments, thick 
skin cream, or vitamin E oil several 
times daily. If cleansing is necessary, 
the skin is blotted and not rubbed. 
Tattoos generally take 2 weeks to 
heal; sun exposure should be avoided 
or sunscreen should be used, and 
swimming, direct shower jets, or 
soaking in water should be avoided. 
Clothing that might adhere to the 
tattoo site should not be worn.3
The inks of tattoos are a mixture 
of inorganic and synthetic organic 
pigments and diluents. They are 
considered cosmetics by the US 
Food and Drug Administration. 
Metal salts are commonly used as 
pigments; aluminum, cadmium, 
chromium, cobalt, iron, mercury, 
nickel, silicon, and titanium are 
a few of the metallic elements in

 tattoo pigments.26 Although the 
concentration of metals in tattoo ink 
is low, metals are emerging as a class 
of human carcinogens. Cutaneous 
exposure over a lifetime may result 
in adverse events. Risk is modified 
by bioavailability, cellular uptake, 
metal interactions, protein binding, 
bone sequestration, and excretion. 
Age, sex, genetic variance, and other 
factors also appear to influence 
potential toxicity.27
Unfortunately, many tattoos are 
placed by amateurs, which makes 
the process much riskier. In these 
cases, antiseptic processes may not 
be followed, leading to potential 
skin infections and transmission 
of bloodborne illnesses, such as 
hepatitis C or HIV. Prison tattooing is 
usually painful because of the use of 
typically blunt instruments that are 
available. The generally poor quality 
and obvious visual location tends to 
stigmatize prisoners on release and 
may limit their chances of obtaining 
employment (see the previous 
section about public and employer 
perceptions as well).28 The pigments 
are not standardized and may also 
contain more toxic materials as well 
as contamination.27
Permanent Makeup
Permanent makeup has become 
an increasingly popular form of 
tattooing. Permanent makeup 
advertisers talk about the advantages 
of being waterproof, not smearing, 
time saving, and hassle free. Some 
people choose permanent makeup 
because of physical limitations, such 
as visual impairments or arthritis 
of the hands or shoulders. Cosmetic 
tattooing can also be an adjunctive 
to reconstructive surgery, such 
as nipple reconstruction after a 
mastectomy or breast reduction 
surgery. It is also used to cover 
scars, birthmarks, alopecia, and 
vitiligo. Cosmetic tattooing also may 
be attractive to patients who have 
allergies to conventional cosmetics.29 
The method of tattooing is similar to 
what is discussed previously.
Henna and Temporary Tattoos
The henna plant contains the pigment 
lawsone; in the skin, it interacts with 
keratin to give a reddish-brown color 
(sometimes known as “red henna” to 
distinguish from “black henna, 
”  
which is red henna mixed with 
paraphenylenediamine [PPD]). Red 
henna is commonly used in Islamic 
and Hindu societies, especially for 
celebrations such as weddings and 
religious ceremonies. The henna 
powder is mixed with a variety of 
materials depending on the artist 
and the region. They may include 
essential oils, such as lemon or 
eucalyptus, the dried powder of 
indigo plant leaves, lemon or beet 
root juice, tannin from tea leaves, 
dried coffee, charcoal powder, 
turpentine, PPD (discussed later), 
or even animal urine. Henna also 
has been used in different ways for 
medicinal purposes beyond the scope 
of this report.30
The paste is applied to the skin 
and remains for 30 minutes to 6 
hours; the longer the exposure, the 
darker the color. At that point, there 
will be an orange stain, which will 
darken over the next 2 to 4 days. A 
temporary tattoo will usually last for 
2 to 6 weeks, until the outer layer of 
skin exfoliates.30
complications
The rate of complications from 
having tattoos placed is not known. 
However, with the large number 
of tattoos placed every day and 
few reports of complications from 
clients who receive tattoos, the rate 
is likely low. Most of the relevant 
medical literature are case reports or 
reports of local clusters of infection. 
Reported complications of tattoos are 
inflammation, infections (bacterial 
and viral), neoplasms, and rare 
reports of vasculitis. Inflammation 
is caused by sensitivity to tattoo 
pigments leading to focal edema, 
pruritus, papules, or nodules at the 
site. Pathologically, the reactions 
include lichenoid, eczematoid, 
sarcoidal, and pseudolymphomatous 
reactions as well as foreign-body 
granulomas. Preexisting conditions 
can lead to other reactions; psoriasis, 
systemic lupus, and sarcoidosis 
may demonstrate the Koebner 
phenomenon, leading to new 
lesions at the site of the tattoo. 
Even temporary henna tattoos have 
been associated with inflammatory 
reactions.31
Infections are a potentially more 
serious complication of tattooing. 
Tattooing can lead to infection 
caused by contaminated tattoo ink 
or needles; inadequate disinfection 
of the skin to be tattooed, resulting 
in resident bacterial contamination 
during the tattooing process; and, 
secondarily, during the healing 
process, when injured tissue causes 
pruritus.32 Unfortunately, the real 
frequency of local infections after 
tattooing is unknown. Infections 
may be superficial pyogenic 
infections, deep or severe pyogenic 
infections, atypical mycobacterial 
infections, systemic or cutaneous 
viral infections, or (rarely) cutaneous 
fungal infections. Systemic viral 
infections from bloodborne 
pathogens include hepatitis C, 
hepatitis B, and HIV. Superficial 
pyogenic infections are usually 
related to Staphylococcus aureus 
or Streptococcus pyogenes, with 
common patterns of pustules or 
papulopustules along the tattoo 
lines. Infections are typically 
present 4 to 22 days after tattooing. 
Infections range from cellulitis and 
small pustules to larger abscesses 
that require surgical incision and 
drainage. Management is similar 
to other skin pyogenic infections. 
More severe pyogenic infections 
remain rare, but there are case 
reports of endocarditis, spinal 
abscess, erysipelas, gangrene, and 
amputations.33

 There are many case reports 
of patients who have acquired 
nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) 
infections after receiving tattoos.34, 
 
35  
The infection usually is caused 
by contamination of the ink or 
equipment with nonsterile water.36 
Infections with Mycobacterium 
chelonae and Mycobacterium 
abscessus, which are rapidly growing 
bacteria, have occurred from the 
contamination of either inks or 
diluents. NTM infections range from 
mild inflammation with lesional 
rash, papules, or nodules to severe 
abscesses requiring extensive and 
multiple surgical débridements. 
NTM infections may require a 
minimum of 4 weeks of treatment 
with 2 or more antibiotic agents.36 
Examples of antibiotic agents that 
have been used, with variable success 
and sensitivities, are amikacin, 
ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin, 
clarithromycin, minocycline, 
tigecycline, cefoxitin, imipenem, 
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 
and linezolid.35 Antibiotic sensitivity 
is important in designing a 
treatment plan.37 Consultation with 
an infectious disease expert for 
suspected NTM infection in a tattoo is 
warranted.
Another case report described Herpes 
compuncturum that developed 3 days 
after tattooing; it was concluded that 
this was a secondary infection in a 
patient in whom S aureus also was 
detected. Antibiotic therapy, antiviral 
therapy, and pain management 
resolved the rash.33
Bloodborne pathogens may 
occur after tattooing. Tattooing 
is associated with hepatitis B 
transmission, especially in teenagers 
with other high-risk behaviors.38 
Tattooing also is associated 
with higher rates of hepatitis C 
transmission.39 HIV transmission 
associated with sharing tattoo 
needles or reusing tattoo inks has 
been reported.40 If tattoos are placed 
in licensed parlors, infections are 
less likely to occur after tattooing 
than if they are placed by unlicensed 
individuals.41
There have been case reports of 
neoplasms associated with or after 
tattoo placement. Keratoacanthoma, 
squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell 
carcinoma, and leiomyosarcoma have 
been described occurring in areas of 
the skin with tattoo pigmentation. 
It is not known whether this is a 
coincidence or a causal effect. Tattoos 
placed over melanocytic nevi can 
make it difficult to monitor to ensure 
there is no malignant transformation, 
and both nevi and melanoma have 
been reported in previously tattooed 
skin.31
Rarely, there have been cases 
reported of acute cutaneous 
vasculitis in tattoo recipients 
occurring 10 to 14 days after 
placement. The following symptoms 
were typical: chills, arthralgia, 
myalgia, and purpuric rash. 
Treatment is similar to the treatment 
of other vasculitides.33
Researchers in one review article 
discuss toxicologic risks of tattoo ink, 
including phototoxicity, substance 
migration, and the possible metabolic 
conversion of tattoo ink ingredients. 
Also reviewed are the potential risks 
associated with cleavage products 
formed during laser-assisted tattoo 
removal.42
Henna and Black Henna Temporary 
Tattoos
Red henna is relatively safe. From a 
population perspective, at least half 
of the population of India has been 
exposed to henna in their lifetimes 
with negligible reported immediate 
hypersensitivity reactions.43 When 
they have occurred, it is not certain 
whether sensitivity is caused by 
the lawsone pigment, another 
component of the henna leaf, or 
the mixture of components. There 
is more concern for hairdressers 
who use henna in dyes because it 
may be an occupational hazard.30 
Treatment is similar to that of other 
hypersensitivity reactions.
The structure and redox potential of 
lawsone is similar to naphthalene, 
a potent oxidant of glucose-6-
dehydrogenase (G6PD)-deficient 
cells. Topical application of red henna 
may cause hemolysis in children with 
G6PD deficiency. The hemolysis can 
be life threatening, with symptoms 
of pallor, lethargy, jaundice, 
anemia, vomiting, tachycardia, poor 
peripheral perfusion, and shock.30
Black henna contains the chemical 
PPD. No natural black henna exists. 
PPD is added to accelerate the dyeing 
and drying process (to 30 minutes), 
to strengthen and darken the color, to 
enhance the design, and to make the 
pattern last longer. These methods 
stain the skin black and have an 
appearance more like a real tattoo. 
Black henna is available worldwide, 
lasts several weeks in the skin, and 
offers an alternative to permanent 
tattoos. It is painless, and because the 
skin is not punctured, there is no risk 
of introducing local or bloodborne 
pathogens. However, there is a slight 
(2.5%) risk of allergic reactions from 
skin sensitization. Once sensitized, 
patients may experience allergic 
contact dermatitis from hair dyes 
that contain PPD. There are also 
reported cross-reactions to other hair 
dyes, dyes used in textiles, rubber 
chemicals, and local anesthetics. 
Some reported reactions were 
severe, requiring hospitalizations, 
especially in children. Most reactions 
were at the site, but generalization 
can occur. It takes several weeks for 
reactions to subside despite topical 
and sometimes oral corticosteroid 
therapy.30
Tattoo removal
The current increasing popularity 
of tattoos in the United States has 
concomitantly spurred an increased 
interest in tattoo removal, although 
tattoo removal is not new. Egyptian 
mummies dating to 4000 BC have 
evidence of attempted tattoo 
removal. Ancient Greek authors 
described the use of salt abrasion

all tattoos are placed intentionally; 
penetration of exogenous pigments 
can occur from road dirt from an 
accident, graphite in pencils, or 
gunpowder, and many people may 
want these unintentional tattoos 
removed.44 Adolescents may 
overestimate the effectiveness of 
tattoo removal when having one 
placed and should be instructed that 
tattoo placement is permanent, and it 
is expensive and sometimes difficult 
to remove them.3 Tattoo removal 
techniques can be categorized as 
mechanical, chemical, ablative, and 
selective.44
“Q-switched” lasers are the current 
state-of-the-art tattoo removal 
method. The laser wavelength is 
adjusted to match the absorption 
pattern of the different color 
pigments. The Q-switched laser 
pulse is delivered over nanoseconds 
with extremely rapid heating as 
high as 900°C (1652°F), leading to 
fragmentation of tattoo pigment 
particles. Immediately after the 
pulse, the epidermis appears white 
because the formation of gas as water 
in the skin is vaporized. An acute 
inflammatory infiltrate surrounds 
the pigment and debris from 
fragmented cells. Tattoo particles 
can be found in regional lymph 
nodes. Phagocytosis and clearance 
of fragmented pigment particles 
ensues. Free pigment is intracellular 
again within 4 weeks. Subsequent 
treatment should be performed after 
at least 4 weeks. One single-session 
laser treatment is available. Longer 
intervals may reduce the risk of 
permanent pigmentary changes to 
the skin.44, 
 
45 It is important to have 
the requisite training in the use of the 
Q-switched laser for tattoo removal; 
the literature notes case reports 
of significant burns within tattoos 
after treatment, leading to scarring 
and poor outcomes.46 In one case 
described in a report, the patient 
elected to have another tattoo placed 
to hide the burned area.47
Other methods that are less 
commonly used for tattoo removal 
include mechanical and chemical 
removal techniques. Mechanical 
methods include dermabrasion 
(which is variably effective) and 
excision with or without grafting 
(mostly for small tattoos; the 
predicted scar remaining would 
have to be acceptable to the patient). 
A number of chemical methods 
have been used with dermabrasion 
or as monotherapy. Imiquimod 
has been applied, with or without 
tretinoin, with mixed results. These 
techniques often result in hypo- or 
hyperpigmentation, or scarring, with 
varying effectiveness.44
Although laser removal may be the 
best way to remove a tattoo, the time, 
needed treatments, and cost should 
not be underestimated. One case 
report noted a 29 year old patient 
with 2 large, multicolored tattoos on 
his arms and chest who presented for 
removal. After 47 treatments, there 
was significant improvement.48 There 
is no cost regulation of laser tattoo 
removal, and price per sq in per 
treatment can be anywhere between 
$49 and $300 depending on the 
location of the removal service. There 
are also standards published that 
involve the skin type and complexion 
of the individual, the colors involved, 
and complexity of the pattern adding 
up to a clinical score known as the 
Kirby-Desai score. A tattoo that is 
15 sq in and is estimated to have 8 
sessions based on this Kirby-Desai 
score could cost $5880, assuming a 
cost of $49 per sq in.49

Methods
A multitude of videos on YouTube 
and other Internet video repositories 
exist for the reader to view and learn 
about safe and acceptable methods 
of body piercing, some of which 
take the observer through the steps, 
including infection control practices. 
Most body piercing jewelry consists 
of rings, hoops, studs, or barbell-
shaped ornaments. The size and 
shape of jewelry is determined by 
the body site pierced and personal 
preferences. Jewelry is not always 
interchangeable between piercing 
sites. In particular, jewelry designed 
for ear piercing may not be suitable 
for another part of the body because 
of the length of the post or the 
pressure exerted by the clasp.50
Most body piercing jewelry is made 
of metal, usually stainless steel, gold, 
niobium, titanium, or alloys. Gold 
often is combined with nickel or 
other metals to make alloys that have 
improved hardness and durability. 
Nickel in gold-filled or gold-plated 
jewelry is associated with a high 
prevalence of reactivity in people 
who are nickel sensitive. Those 
who are getting a piercing should 
pay careful attention to the studs or 
clasps on earrings; jewelry with a 
high karat rating commonly is paired 
with less expensive gold-plated 
studs or earring backs. Niobium and 
titanium are light-weight elemental 
metals that rarely produce an 
allergic response. Other features to 
consider in body piercing jewelry 
include the ease of removal (in case 
of trauma or radiographs), surface 
smoothness, and its capacity to 
withstand autoclaving and cleaning.51 
Surgical stainless steel rarely causes 
allergic skin reactions; however, not 
all stainless-steel products are nickel 
free.52
Although earrings may be sterilized 
before use, most piercing guns are 
not sterilized between procedures. 
Ear piercing systems using 
disposable, sterile cassettes are 
available but are not always used.51 
Because body piercing salons are 
unregulated in many states, some 
physicians may choose to perform 
body piercing procedures in their 
own office settings.

 The lips, cheeks, and midline of the 
tongue are popular sites for oral 
piercings. Perforation of lingual 
blood vessels can cause bleeding 
and hematoma formation. Edema 
frequently develops after a tongue 
piercing, so a longer barbell is 
recommended initially.53 Switching 
to a shorter barbell reduces the 
damage to the dentition and gingiva. 
Of note, beaded jewelry may become 
trapped between the teeth.
The ear is the most universal site for 
body piercing. Multiple ear piercings 
have gained approval, especially 
high piercing through the cartilage 
of the pinna. The nose can be pierced 
in the fleshy nares or through 
the cartilaginous septum. Septal 
piercings usually are performed in 
the inferior, fleshy part of the septum 
and not through cartilaginous tissue. 
The navel or periumbilical area is a 
popular self-piercing site. Navel rings 
and subsequent scarring are more 
problematic in overweight patients 
and in the latter stages of pregnancy 
as abdominal girth expands.
Wearing a curved barbell instead 
of a ring until the navel piercing 
has healed may reduce irritation 
and scarring. Friction from clothing 
with tight-fitting waistbands and 
subsequent skin maceration may 
account for the delayed healing 
and increased infection rates of 
navel piercings. Careful placement 
of jewelry and avoidance of rigidly 
fixed jewelry may minimize these 
problems. Before nipple and areolae 
piercings, men and women should 
be counseled about the lengthy time 
required for complete healing and the 
risk of delayed infection (see Table 1).  
Genital piercings anecdotally have 
been reported to enhance sexual 
sensitivity. Genital piercing sites in 
men include the penile glans, urethra, 
foreskin, and scrotum; sites in 
women include the clitoral prepuce 
or body, labia minora, labia majora, 
and perineum.54
Dermal piercing, also known as 
microdermal piercing or single-point 
piercing, is defined as piercings 
placed into a flat surface of the body. 
The jewelry has an entry point and 
an exit point, but dermal piercing has 
just one end that can be seen on the 
surface of the skin. The second end 
is studded into the dermal layer of 
the skin. This variant of piercing has 
gained a lot of popularity because it 
can be placed on most flat surfaces of 
the body, and designs can be created 
by putting together multiple dermal 
piercings or combining with tattoos. 
They may be difficult to remove and 
may occasionally require surgical 
removal.55, 
 
56
complications
No reliable estimates are available 
regarding people who have 
experienced complications related 
to body piercing. Importantly, 
adolescents and young adults with 
increased vulnerability to infection 
(eg, patients with diabetes mellitus 
or who are taking corticosteroids) 
and those taking anticoagulant 
medications may be at greater risk 
of complications from body piercing. 
However, multiple adverse outcomes 
associated with body piercing have 
been reported, including infection, 
pain, bleeding, hematoma formation, 
cyst formation, allergic reaction, 
hypertrophic scarring, and keloid 
formation.51, 
 
57 
–60
Infection severity ranges from local 
infections (impetigo and cellulitis) 
to more severe infections, including 
osteomyelitis, toxic shock syndrome, 
and bacteremia. Life-threatening 
infections as a result of complications 
associated with body piercing include 
septic arthritis, endocarditis, and 
hepatitis B. With any piercing, there 
is the danger of infection, including 
hepatitis B or C virus and tetanus.41, 
 
61 
 
Body piercing as a possible vector 
for HIV transmission has been 
suggested, although no cases have 
been reported.62, 
 
63
A serious consequence of oral 
piercing is airway compromise 
from trauma, tongue swelling, or 
obstruction by jewelry.64 Securing 
an adequate airway or endotracheal 
intubation can be challenging when 
a patient has a tongue barbell.57, 
 
65 If 
lingual jewelry cannot be removed 
easily or expeditiously, precautions 
should be taken during intubation to 
ensure that jewelry is not loosened 
and aspirated or swallowed. Removal 
of oral and nasal jewelry also is 
recommended before nonemergency 
surgical procedures. Chipping 
or fracturing of teeth is the most 
common dental problem related to 
tongue barbells.66
Although there is a risk of infection 
because of the vast amounts 
of bacteria in the mouth, the 
infection rate is low. Oral rinses 
(eg, Listerine; Johnson and Johnson 
Consumer Companies Inc, New 
Brunswick, NJ) or the application 
of nonprescription cleansers (eg, 
Gly-Oxide Liquid Antiseptic Oral 
Cleanser; GlaxoSmithKline Consumer 
Healthcare, Philadelphia, PA) may be 
recommended prophylactically after 
an oral piercing.67
Ludwig angina is a rapidly spreading 
oral cellulitis and has been reported 
as a complication of tongue 
piercing.68 Treatment involves 
maintaining an adequate airway, the 
administration of systemic antibiotic 
agents, and surgical drainage of 
abscesses.

Downloaded from 
 Of people with ear piercings, up to 
35% had one or more complication 
(eg, minor infection [77%], allergic 
reaction [43%], keloid formation 
[2.5%], and traumatic tearing 
[2.5%]).69 Auricular perichondritis 
and perichondrial abscess typically 
occur in the first month after 
piercing, especially during warm-
weather months.70
Auricular perichondritis presents 
as painful swelling, warmth, and 
redness in a portion of the auricle 
that often spares the earlobe. 
Acute tenderness on deflecting 
the auricular cartilage helps 
distinguish this deeper perichondrial 
infection from a superficial skin 
infection. Minor infections can 
progress to perichondritis, abscess 
formation, and necrosis with or 
without systemic symptoms. The 
most common pathogens (ie, 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, S aureus, 
and S pyogenes) often respond 
well to fluoroquinolone antibiotic 
treatment (eg, ciprofloxacin or 
levofloxacin).71, 
 
72 Alternative options 
for hospitalization will depend on 
the pathogen and might include 
clindamycin, ceftazidime, and 
cefepime.
If an abscess is present, surgical 
incision and drainage often are 
necessary. Once an abscess develops, 
good cosmetic preservation of the 
auricular cartilage is difficult to 
maintain.
Prolonged wearing of heavy jewelry 
also may result in an elongated tract 
or bifid deformity of the earlobe.
People with atopic dermatitis or 
allergic metal contact dermatitis are 
at increased risk of developing minor 
staphylococcal or streptococcal skin 
infections.73
Superficial earlobe infections tend 
to have a benign course and respond 
well to local treatment, including 
warm, moist packs and application of 
over-the-counter, topical antibiotic 
ointment (eg, bacitracin [Polysporin 
and Neosporin; Johnson and 
Johnson Consumer Companies Inc, 
New Brunswick, NJ]). Treatment 
with mupirocin ointment or oral 
antistaphylococcal antibiotic agents 
may be warranted.61 Oral antibiotic 
agents, such as the first-generation 
cephalosporins (eg, cephalexin 
or cefadroxil and penicillinase-
resistant penicillins), are appropriate 
treatment options for more extensive 
but uncomplicated skin and soft 
tissue infections. Alternative 
antibiotic agents (ie, clindamycin or 
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) may 
be more appropriate in communities 
that have higher rates of methicillin-
resistant S aureus cases. Guidelines 
for the treatment of methicillin-
resistant S aureus, according to 
the Infectious Diseases Society of 
America, also suggest doxycycline or 
linezolid might also be appropriate.74 
An earring can be replaced, or the 
ear can be repierced 6 to 8 weeks 
after resolution of local swelling and 
tenderness.51
The earlobe is a common site for 
hypertrophic scarring and keloid 
formation. In addition to aesthetic 
concerns, patients with keloids 
may have itching and tenderness. 
Treatment options for keloids include 
surgical excision, intralesional 
corticosteroid injections, 
cryosurgery, pressure dressing, 
radiation, and laser therapy.75, 
 
76
Contact dermatitis resulting from 
nickel exposure is common. Contact 
sensitivity to gold and localized 
argyria, a skin discoloration resulting 
from silver salts, also have been 
described.77, 
 
78 Avoidance of the 
metals that trigger a reaction and the 
application of topical corticosteroids 
hasten the resolution of allergic 
dermatitis.
Occasionally, inflammation or 
infection result in such significant 
swelling that an earring should be 
removed. The pierced hole can be 
maintained, if desired, by inserting 
a ring made from a 20-gauge Teflon 
catheter with silicone tubing into 
the hole while the surrounding skin 
heals.79 Similarly, a loop fashioned 
from nylon suture material may keep 
a piercing intact during the healing 
process.
Earrings can also become embedded 
in the earlobe, a complication 
common in persons with thick, 
fleshy earlobes that are pierced 
with spring-loaded guns.80 Piercing 
guns exert high pressure on the soft 
tissue of the earlobe and cannot be 
adjusted for varying tissue thickness. 
Embedding may be prevented by 
using longer earring posts with 
adjustable backings. If gentle probing 
fails to locate an embedded earring, a 
small incision under local anesthesia 
(without epinephrine) may be 
necessary to locate and remove the 
earring or backing. Any suspected 
infection should be treated.80
Trauma to the pierced external ear 
is common. Lacerations to the ear 
may occur after falls, motor vehicle 
crashes, contact sports, person-to-
person violence, or accidental pulling 
of an earring. The simplest laceration 
occurs when an earring is pulled 
through the earlobe, especially if the 
original earring hole was close to 
the periphery. All wounds should be 
cleaned and repaired within 12 to 24 
hours. A simple earlobe tear can be 
sutured under local anesthesia. If the 
hole has closed, the earlobe can be 
repierced in an unscarred area after 
∼3 months.81
Various closure techniques have been 
described in the literature. More 
complex lacerations of ear cartilage 
should be referred to subspecialists 
for repair.82
Pointed earring posts may cause 
pressure sores or postauricular skin 
irritation when worn during sleep. 
The removal of jewelry at bedtime is 
indicated if switching to a different 
earring style does not resolve the 
problem. Parents of infants or young 
children with pierced ears should be 
informed of the risk of aspiration and 
ingestion of earring parts. In such

 situations, earrings with a locking 
back or screw back are advisable.83
A localized infection of the earlobe 
may not be easily differentiated from 
allergic contact dermatitis unless 
there is purulent drainage or a high 
index of suspicion.78
Piercing the nasal cartilage can cause 
significant bleeding and lead to septal 
hematoma formation that often is 
accompanied by infection. Other 
potential complications that may 
result in cosmetic deformities include 
perichondritis and necrosis of the 
cartilaginous nasal wall. Infection 
requires aggressive treatment with 
antibiotic agents that have good 
coverage against Staphylococcus 
species that commonly colonize 
the nasal mucosa. Mupirocin is 
effective and offers excellent 
coverage against Gram-positive cocci. 
Fluoroquinolones have the advantage 
of excellent skin penetration and 
added coverage against Pseudomonas 
species.84
Nasal jewelry has the potential to 
be aspirated or swallowed. Rings 
placed in the nostril or septum also 
can migrate forward or be pulled 
out. As with ear piercing, the studs or 
backings of the jewelry may become 
embedded and require surgical 
removal.84 Abscess formation has 
been reported after nipple piercing.85
There are case reports of cellulitis 
and spread of infection around a 
breast implant after a piercing.86, 
 
87  
However, little information is 
available about nipple piercing 
after breast implantation or chest 
wall augmentation. The effects of 
nipple piercings on lactation are 
not clear, but jewelry or scar tissue 
could impair latching on or block 
a milk duct and adversely affect an 
infant’s ability to breastfeed. Nipple 
piercings should be removed to 
avoid aspiration by the infant during 
lactation.
Jewelry inserted through the glans 
penis may interrupt urinary flow. 
Paraphimosis (ie, the inability to 
replace a retracted foreskin) has 
been associated with urethral and 
glans piercings in uncircumcised 
men.88 The foreskin may be reduced 
manually after a penile nerve block. 
If this maneuver is unsuccessful, 
the prepuce can be injected 
with hyaluronidase to allow the 
edematous fluid to dissipate.89
Penile rings also can cause 
engorgement and priapism (ie, 
persistent erection), requiring 
emergency treatment to preserve 
erectile function. Women with genital 
piercings can develop bleeding, 
infections, allergic reactions, keloids, 
and scarring.90
It is advisable that sexually active 
people with genital piercings 
be counseled that jewelry may 
compromise the use of barrier 
contraceptive methods. Condoms 
may be more prone to break, and 
diaphragms may be more easily 
dislodged during sexual activity 
when 1 or both partners have genital 
piercings. Avoiding jewelry with 
sharp edges and using looser-fitting 
condoms or double condoms may 
help avoid some of these problems.91
From a unique study on urban 
teenagers and their knowledge of 
piercing complications, 
92 33% of all 
subjects reported knowing someone 
who has had a medical or health 
problem related to body piercing; 
they most commonly reported 
infections (74%), bleeding (30%), 
allergic reactions (26%), and bruising 
and keloids (19% each) (see Table 2). 
 
Among those subjects with body 
piercings, 12% reported having had 
personal experiences with health 
problems related to the piercing, 
including infections, bleeding, 
bruising, and allergic reaction. 
Interestingly, those who got their 
piercings in a body-piercing shop 
were far more likely to report having 
had an infection (18.4%) than those 
who got pierced elsewhere (1.9%).92
Adolescents were asked to estimate 
the percent chance of having a 
piercing-related health problem. 
The perceived risk for piercing by 
a professional (34%) was lower 
compared with a nonprofessional 
(73%). Neither those with a piercing 
nor those who had a problem 
with a piercing perceived risk any 
differently. Those who had pierced 
themselves perceived much less risk 
from piercing by a nonprofessional 
(50%) than those who had been 
pierced but not by themselves. Those 
with piercings of the face (nose, 
eyebrow, lips, and chin) tended to 
perceive less risk for face piercing 
(41.5%) compared with those

 without (49.7%). In the analysis of 
perceived risk, there were no effects 
of race, sex, or age.92
In a recent review from 2012, similar 
complications were confirmed, 
including systemic infections (such 
as viral hepatitis and toxic shock 
syndrome) and distant infections 
(such as endocarditis and brain 
abscesses).58 It was recommended 
that body piercers have their clients 
complete a medical and social history 
to identify conditions that may 
predispose them to complications. 
Piercing candidates should choose 
a qualified practitioner to perform 
their piercings.58
One small study of children and 
adults with congenital heart disease 
found no cases of endocarditis after 
ear piercing, although only 6% of 
the patients received prophylactic 
antibiotic treatment.93
There have been recent reports of 
bacterial endocarditis after nipple 
and navel piercings in patients with 
surgically corrected congenital 
heart disease. It is important for 
physicians to know about planned 
piercings so they can consider 
antibiotic prophylaxis in patients 
with moderate- or high-risk 
cardiac conditions,

guidelines on endocarditis

stretching Methods
Ear stretching is a modification 
practiced by and originating from 
indigenous peoples. Tribes in 
various countries in Africa, Eurasia, 
America, and other indigenous 
lands have practiced the ritual 
of ear stretching for cultural, 
religious, and traditional purposes. 
Ear stretching is a ritual that has 
been practiced by people all over 
the world since ancient times. 
Bone, horn, wood, and stone were 
generally carved for ear stretching, 
but other organic materials that 
had the right shape naturally, from 
shells to teeth and claws, were also 
used.
Many cultures have practiced 
stretching, including ancient 
Egyptians (eg, King Tutankhamen), 
Buddhists from Nepal, Mursi tribal 
women of Ethiopia, and the African 
Maasai from Kenya and Tanzania. 
Stretching is also apparent in the 
Easter Island heads. Historically, 
the practice has been used for the 
purpose of tribal status, to scare 
enemies in war, and for beauty 
purposes. It has been and still is 
a common practice for both men 
and women. For men, it has been 
used historically to indicate the 
standing members of a specific 
tribe. The bigger the stretching, the 
higher the ranking the man had. As 
for women, ear stretching is more 
for decorative purposes and also 
signifies when a girl has reached 
womanhood. These practices are 
still important and used today by 
many tribes and cultures.50
Stretching, in the context of body 
piercing, is the deliberate expansion 
of a healed piercing for the purpose 
of wearing certain types of jewelry. 
Ear piercings are the most commonly 
stretched piercings, with nasal 
septum piercings, tongue piercings, 
and lip piercings and lip plates 
following close behind. Although all 
piercings can be stretched to some 
degree, cartilage piercings are usually 
more difficult to stretch and more 
likely to form hypertrophic scars if 
stretched quickly. Dermal punching 
is generally the preferred method 
for accommodating larger jewelry in 
cartilage piercings.50
Stretching should be performed in 
small increments to minimize the 
potential for damaging the healed 
piercing or creating scar tissue. In 
North America, most stretching 
methods go up by a single, even-sized 
gauge increment at a time. Stretching 
to 2 gauge, or 6 mm, is considered the 
point of no return, and the hole will 
not close to a standard piercing size if 
the “plug” is removed.
The typical jewelry worn in a 
large, stretched piercing is a plug, 
sometimes incorrectly referred to 
as a gauge, which refers to the sizing 
system used in the United States. It 
is solid, usually cylindrical, and may 
be flared out at one or both ends 
(saddle shaped) or kept in place by 
o-rings fastened around the ends. A 
variation on this is the flesh tunnel, 
which is shaped in the same way 
but is hollow in the middle. Claw-, 
talon-, and spiral-shaped pieces 
are also commonplace. Ear weights 
in varying degrees of size are also 
worn, commonly made from silver or 
bronze, although other metals, such 
as copper or brass, are occasionally 
used. However, some people are 
easily irritated by some metals; 
therefore, care should be taken when 
metal jewelry is worn. Ear cuffs (such 
as the gold ones used in South Indian 
provinces) or wrapped bead work 
(common among the Maasai of East 
Africa) are other options, although 
these are not usually seen in modern 
Western contexts.50
With both body piercing and 
stretching, the system of gauges and 
inches is used in gauge size notation, 
which was originally meant for wire 
thickness determination. A gauge 
number denotes a thickness on a 
standardized scale, which, for most 
purposes, starts at 20 gauge (0.03 
in or 0.81 mm). This is most often 
used for the nose and ear post studs. 
Importantly, as the gauge number 
decreases to 0 gauge or even 00 
gauge, the thickness of the piercing 
increases.50
regulation of Tattooing and Piercing
Although no reliable estimates exist

 and strong infection-control 
practices. Individual states have 
regulated tattooing for decades to 
address public health concerns. 
States did not have any common 
standards until 1999, when the 
National Environmental Health 
Association published Body Art: A 
Comprehensive Guidebook and Model 
Code.99 This was an interdisciplinary 
collaboration of academics, public 
health professionals, professional 
organizations, physicians, 
environmental health experts, and 
body art practitioners. The model 
provided detailed recommendations 
for and guidelines on sanitation and 
infection control. Artist training 
should include competence in 
sterilization procedures, anatomy, 
and infection control. As of 2012, 
41 states each had at least one 
statute in place regulating tattooing. 
The remaining 9 states delegate 
authority to local-level and individual 
jurisdictions within those states. 
Even with these regulations, 72% 
of states do not effectively regulate 
sanitation, training and licensing, 
and infection control. Training and 
licensing was the least consistently 
regulated topic. Pediatric health care 
providers are recommended to learn 
about regulations in local states or 
jurisdictions.100
Similarly, there has been 
considerable debate about 
adolescents who are minors 
obtaining tattoos and parental 
consent requirements (Table 3). At 
least 45 states have laws prohibiting 
minors from getting tattoos. Thirty-
eight states have laws that prohibit 
both body piercing and tattooing on 
minors without parental permission. 
Each state varies on legislation of 
body piercing and tattooing.101 It 
has been a challenge for states to 
keep pace with the new body art 
forms. Almost every state has laws 
addressing some aspect of body art. 
Nevada has no laws addressing body 
art; Maryland has limited laws. In 
New Hampshire, body piercing is 
not permitted on a person younger 
than 18 years without consent of that 
person’s parent or legal guardian. 
The consenting individual needs to 
be physically present at the time of 
piercing, provide evidence of status 
as parent or legal guardian, and sign 
a document that provides informed 
consent. Penalties for violators are 
fines, prison time, or both; most of 
these laws define violators as the 
person who performed the tattoo 
or piercing. Pediatric health care 
providers are encouraged to educate 
themselves about laws related 
to minors obtaining tattoos and 
piercings in their states.101

Methods
Scarification involves cutting, 
burning, or branding words or 
images into the skin. Although many 
people who have scarification have 
it done by amateurs, professional 
practitioners of this type of body 
modification use a variety of 
methods. The purpose is to create a

 permanent body modification. Some 
practitioners will also use methods 
that enhance scar formation, such 
as scraping off scabs or irritating 
the wound with materials such as 
iodine, citrus juice, or toothpaste. 
In some traditional cultures, ash 
or clay is packed into the wound 
to encourage hypertrophied scars. 
There are many methods in use, 
including the following: hot and 
cold branding (the latter with liquid 
nitrogen), moxibustion (placing 
incense on the skin and allowing 
it to burn until it’s extinguished 
in the skin), cutting with a scalpel, 
thermo- and electrocautery, and 
laser branding.103
complications
Scarification does not produce 
consistent results and does not 
always produce the outcomes 
desired. Infection is a possible 
complication of any of these 
methods. Scarification artists 
may not be as experienced with 
these processes perhaps because 
of less demand for this method.3 
Additionally, keloids may be a 
complication (essentially, keloid 
formation is the complication of 
any of these body modification 
methods). There are emerging 
treatment strategies for keloid 
scars, but the best strategy is 
prevention. People who have had 
keloids or have family members 
with keloids should be informed 
that the outcome of scarification is 
uncertain.104
regulation of scarification
Although not as regulated as 
tattooing, the amount of state 
regulation regarding scarification 
is increasing. As of February 2014, 
4 states prohibit scarification, and 
16 other states’ legislation could 
be interpreted as regulating or 
prohibiting scarification. Eleven 
other states have some regulation as 
part of body art practice. Nineteen 
states do not address scarification.104
aDvIce fOr PeDIaTrIcIans
general Issues
1. Pediatricians should recognize 
the difference between voluntary 
body modifications and the 
impulsive NSSI syndrome; and
2. As with all adolescent decisions 
that involve significant 
consequences, it is recommended 
that adolescents speak with their 
parents, guardians, or other 
responsible adults before having 
tattoos placed.
Tattoos and Henna
1. Adolescents and their families 
should be informed that tattoos 
are permanent and that removal 
is difficult, expensive, and only 
partially effective;
2. Pediatricians should advise 
adolescents with a history of 
keloid formation to avoid body 
modifications that puncture the 
skin. The outcome is uncertain 
whenever there is trauma to the 
skin resulting in scar;
3. Pediatricians should advise  
their adolescent patients  
to assess the sanitary and hygienic 
practices of the tattoo parlors and 
tattoo artists. This would include 
observing the use of  
new, disposable gloves; the 
removal of the new needle and 
equipment from a sealed, sterile 
container; and the use of fresh, 
unused ink poured into a new, 
disposable container with each 
new client;
4. Pediatricians should advise 
adolescents to seek medical care 
if there are signs and symptoms 
of infection. Normal skin and 
soft tissue infections should be 
considered first, but if there are 
any unusual features, prompt 
evaluation by a dermatologist 
is recommended. If there is 
confirmed mycobacterial infection, 
consultation with an infectious 
disease specialist is warranted;
5. Lesions that appear to grow  
and/or change within a tattoo are 
an indication for evaluation for 
neoplasms;
6. Pediatricians should inform 
families of the risk of hemolysis 
with red henna temporary 
tattoos for children or others 
with a positive G6PD deficiency. 
Black henna temporary tattoos 
should be avoided because of the 
significant rate of sensitization;
7. It may be advisable for 
pediatricians to familiarize 
themselves with local laws and 
regulations related to tattooing to 
inform families should pediatric 
patients be interested in having 
tattoos placed; and
8. Adolescents should be counseled 
about the implications on job 
placement and maintenance and 
education if the tattoos are at all 
visible.
Piercings and stretching
1. Rinsing with nonprescription 
oral cleansers or the topical 
application of cleansers is 
recommended to prevent infection 
after oral piercing;
2. Antibiotic agents with good 
coverage against Pseudomonas 
and Staphylococcus species (eg, 
fluoroquinolones) are advised 
when treating piercing-associated 
infections of the auricular cartilage;
3. At clean piercing establishments, 
the piercer should be observed 
putting on new, disposable gloves 
and removing new equipment 
from a sterile container;
4. Adolescents contemplating a 
tongue piercing should be advised 
of the high incidence of tooth 
chipping associated with these 
piercings;
5. Pediatricians play an important 
role in promoting injury

 prevention by recommending 
that all jewelry be removed 
during contact sports to avoid 
endangering the wearer and other 
players. Jewelry that interferes 
with mouth guards or protective 
equipment should be removed 
before play. Nipple jewelry should 
be removed before breastfeeding;
6. It is important for pediatricians 
to understand local laws and 
regulations related to piercing to 
inform families should pediatric 
patients be interested in having a 
piercing; and
7. Adolescents should be counseled 
about the implications on job

scarification
1. Teenagers with a personal or 
family history of keloids should 
be cautioned about the risk 
associated with scarification 
and other body modification 
processes; and
2. Infections resulting from 
scarification may be treated 
similar to other skin and soft 
tissue infections, with standard 
topical or systemic antibiotic 
agents.
