ABSTRACT
Background Politicians in many countries have embraced the notion that health inequalities derive from socioeconomic inequalities, but
European governments have for the most part failed to enact policies that would reduce underlying social inequalities.
Methods Data are drawn from 84 in-depth interviews with policy-makers in four European countries between 2012 and 2015, qualitative
content analysis of recent health inequalities policy documents, and secondary literature on the barriers to implementing evidence-based health
inequalities policies.
Results Institutional and political barriers are important barriers to effective policy. Both policy-making institutions and the ideas and practices
associated with neoliberalism reinforce medical-individualist models of health, strengthen actors with material interests opposed to policies that
would increase equity, and undermine policy action to tackle the fundamental causes of social (including health) inequalities.
Conclusions Medicalizing inequality is more appealing to most politicians than tackling income and wage inequality head-on, but it results in framing
the problem of social inequality in a way that makes it technically quite difficult to solve. Policy-makers should consider adopting more traditional
programs of taxation, redistribution and labor market regulation in order to reduce both health inequalities and the underlying social inequalities.
Keywords health policy, health inequalities, medicalization, social determinants
Introduction
Growing recognition of socioeconomic inequalities in health in
the rich western democracies presents politicians with an appar-
ent opportunity: by embracing health inequalities as a political
problem, they can proclaim their attachment to the issue of
equity while at the same time avoiding direct discussion of
contentious issues like redistribution of income and wealth.
Framing the problem of social inequality in health terms
may be safer for politicians than speaking directly about inequal-
ities in the fundamental causes of health;1 but, I argue, it
reshapes the policy-making environment surrounding social
inequality in ways that make it more difficult to reduce both
social inequality and health inequalities. Political and institutional
factors associated with shifting from a social inequality to a
health inequality frame pose substantial barriers to reducing
inequality, bringing into play institutions that act to reinforce
medical, behavioral and neoliberal policy approaches.
To show how reframing social inequality in health terms
may make it harder to reduce both forms of inequality, I draw
on a variety of sources and methods. These include 84 in-depth
interviews with health policy experts and policy-makers in
England, Finland, France, Belgium and at the WHO Regional
Office for Europe; qualitative content analysis of recent govern-
ment reports and plans and process-tracing reviews of the
secondary literature on policy responses to health inequalities
in (see Table 1 for details).
The health inequality problem frame
and its policy outputs
Epidemiologists and policy actors have long been aware of the
link between social inequality and health inequalities.2–4 In the
modern era, the 1980 Black Report in the UK5 set in motion
a process of linking health and social inequality in political dis-
course (see Table 2)—most visibly in the 1997 national elec-
tion campaign in Britain, in which the Labour party

 successfully used the issue of health inequalities to ‘kick the
Tories’ (UK4), highlighting the failure of the incumbent
Conservative government’s health and economic policies.
Scholars and international organizations have helped to
define the policy problem of health inequalities in a way that is
closely linked to social inequality more broadly. The dominant
definition of health inequalities, articulated by Whitehead6 and
echoed in the final report of the WHO Commission on the
Social Determinants of Health (CSDH),7 invokes social
inequality as the driver of health inequalities and recommends
redistributive policies to combat these inequalities. Key policy
statements such as the CSDH report and the Lancet-University
of Oslo Commission report8 say little about ‘whose resources,
and how and through what instruments’ ought to be redistribu-
ted.9–12 But despite this lack of a roadmap for producing a
more equal distribution of the upstream social determinants of
health, the health inequalities problem frame has disseminated
throughout Europe via scholarly networks like the Eurothine

With the social determinants of health (SDOH) problem
framing as a backdrop, some political actors in Europe have
followed the example set by the Labour party in 1997 and
embraced health inequalities as a political issue. Between
May 2012 and March 2015, I conducted interviews with 84
policy experts and policy-makers that touched on motiva-
tions for politicizing the issue of health inequalities in their
country. Interviews with English policy actors confirmed
that the health inequalities problem frame, with its focus on
the social determinants of health, allowed center-left policy-
makers to reintroduce the possibility of redistributive social
policy when the neoliberal consensus of the 1980s and
1990s made consideration of such policies fraught.
Other interviewees, notably in France and Finland,
explained that the health inequalities issue was politically
useful because it resonated with a longstanding political
emphasis on social equality in their countries without dir-
ectly

income
inequality
or
redistribution.
Raising the issue of health inequalities was also viewed by
French, Finnish and Belgian interviewees as lending legit-
imacy to policy-makers’ attempts to reform other aspects
of the health system (e.g. limiting expenditures, controlling
providers or insurers, reducing geographical variation in
health services consumption or supply). (Other cited ratio-
nales for adopting health inequalities as a political issue
that were mentioned by multiple respondents were because
the issue was ’in vogue’ or being promoted by actors at
the EU level or within the WHO; because the issue of
health inequalities was electorally popular; because it

sitting on a social volcano when it comes to talking about class inequalities in France.’

‘The social inequalities in health framing is window dressing. The global context is a strong contraction of the

affirm that they have some big plan for reforming health without spending any money. The social
inequalities in health framing allows them to show political will without actually spending any money.’

questioning the system, for example income inequalities.’

REFRAMING INEQUALITY?

 seemed a topic capable of generating political consensus
across levels of government, regions, parties or within
center-left parties.)
Since politicians adopt health inequalities as a political
problem for different reasons, and with varying degrees
of commitment, many aspects of the policy response to
health inequalities naturally also differ across countries.20–
24 Nevertheless, the health inequality issue ‘package’ by
now comes with a standard set of widely publicized policy
recommendations from the WHO: coordinated, multisec-
toral action, led by national governments, that reaches
beyond the health sector to reduce or eliminate the inequal-
ities in the upstream social determinants of health. It is
therefore surprising that policy in countries where health
inequality is on the political agenda is not more consistent
with this problem frame.
Even when key national policy documents regarding
health inequalities pay lip service to the social determinants
of health, government policies to reduce health inequalities
often rely on medicalized understandings of primary care
and prevention25–27 and health promotion policies enacted
with an eye to reducing health inequalities tend to target
individuals and their behaviors rather than the structures
within which these behaviors take place.28 Furthermore, sys-
tematic efforts to reduce inequalities in the ‘fundamental
causes’1 of health have been vanishingly rare. Actions against
poverty and marginalization have played a role in health
inequalities plans from England to France to Finland, but to
date only Norway among the European countries has a
national health inequalities reduction program that highlights
reducing income inequality as a means to reduce health
inequalities.29,30
Increasing political attention to health inequalities has not
been accompanied by substantial reductions in health
inequalities.15,31,32 If measured against the increase in under-
lying social inequality, some health inequalities reduction
plans may be counted as successes merely because they have
prevented health inequalities from growing. Nevertheless, it
seems noteworthy that political attention to health inequal-
ities has not produced policies that are consonant with the
dominant paradigm that shapes thinking about health
inequalities in European countries. To the extent that the
recommended policy strategy of acting on the fundamental
causes, upstream social determinants, or causes of the causes
would in fact reduce health inequalities, explaining why these
policies have not become more common after the ‘health
inequalities turn’ can help us understand why political atten-
tion to health inequalities may undermine attempts to reduce
inequality.
Why the health inequalities frame makes
it harder to reduce health inequalities
Public health scholars have advanced a number of explanations
for the failure of government policy meaningfully to reduce
health inequalities. Many analysts cite a lack of data about health
inequalities or a lack of evidence about what works as a major
obstacle to creating policies that are adapted to reducing health
inequalities.33 Some skepticism still exists concerning the central
causal claim of the dominant health inequalities problem frame
that socioeconomic inequality is the primary cause of health
inequalities.34–36 Nevertheless, the epidemiological literature is
replete with macro-level evidence that would support the
CSDHs recommendation to focus on the ‘causes of the causes’
of health.7,37–43 If policy responses do not correspond to the
health inequality frame’s hypothesized causal processes, it is
likely due less to a lack of evidence than to a lack of evidence-
based policy-making.28,44,45 Why has policy-making not fol-
lowed the standard health inequalities prescription?
One reason may be that reframing social inequality as a
problem of health medicalizes the problem of inequality, mak-
ing it seem less amenable to systemic or structural solutions.
As several scholars have noted, a belief in individualism links
neoliberalism and the medical model of health, and makes the
two meta-frames especially compatible.9,28,46 This resonance
may allow neoliberal ideas to influence policy styles, particu-
larly in institutional settings like health ministries that are
dominated by actors who have a medicalized understanding
of health, or among public health professionals whose training
and outlook is primarily biomedical rather than social.47 The
medicalization of health inequalities policy can also occur as a
result of more subtle forms of institutional filtering.45,48 Even
when actors understand the social determinants paradigm and
are committed to reducing health inequalities, the power of
medical actors in the health field, the disease- and issue-based
‘silos’ between and within departments, and historical deci-
sions to prioritize certain health problems may explain why
some ideas within the dominant health inequalities frame are
translated more or less intact into policy, while others—like
the need to act on the upstream determinants of health—are
transformed or ignored.45
Beyond medicalization, framing the issue of social inequal-
ity as a problem of health inequalities may make the problem
seem more difficult to solve. One reason is that health
inequalities are the result of multiple, interacting and distal
causes. The standard policy remedy, multisectoral policy-
making, is in fact extremely difficult, requiring clarity about
goals; capacities for joint action; relationships on which to
base cooperative action; well-conceived policies that can be

 implemented and evaluated; clear roles and responsibilities;
and plans to monitor and sustain outcomes.49 Barriers to
cross-sectoral action include coordination problems, issues of
sustainability, political power-plays and the need to negotiate
the roles and resources of (public) health versus medical
actors and health versus other sectors.50,51 Interviewees
reported that officials in non-health policy sectors could be
resistant to the very language of ‘Health in All Policies,’
which suggested an imperialism of the health sector (FI5,
FI6, BE8, EU1, WHO1 and WHO2). Indeed, in the arena
of health inequalities policy, cross-sectoral policy-making can
work, but often it does not.52
The difficulty of cross-sectoral policy action is only one
result of framing the issue of social inequality in terms that
foreground complex causation. Many analysts of health
inequalities policy-making understand health inequalities as a
‘wicked problem’.33,49,53–56 Such problems involve disputes
over the definition of the public good and have no definitive
solutions; evidence about how to solve the problem is often
missing or uncertain; and there are numerous possible inter-
vention points, the consequences of which are hard to fore-
see. Together, these characteristics create problems that are
surrounded by uncertainty, and likely to seem insoluble using
policy approaches within the current repertoire of policy-
makers.
The health inequalities problem frame spotlights many of
these troubling characteristics. The social determinants causal
interpretation and the cross-sectoral treatment recommenda-
tion highlight the complexity of causation and the multiple
systems that must be recruited into the solution. A focus on
inequalities operating over the life-course implies that out-
comes of interventions are bound to be distal. Furthermore,
the moral evaluation inherent to the health inequalities prob-
lem frame—exonerating individuals and blaming market
inequalities and government policies for health inequalities—
brings into focus how value-laden are both the definition of
and the solutions to the problem of health inequalities. By
highlighting the ‘wickedness’ of inequality, the health inequal-
ities policy framing renders the problem of social inequality
impossible to solve.
If health inequalities are wickedly complex, with a rela-
tively weak evidence base to attest to the effectiveness of
specific interventions, it should not be surprising that even
governments that are committed to reducing health inequal-
ities might find it difficult to enact these policies. Of course
the wider political environment can also influence decisions
about the policies that ought to be enacted in order to
address the problem of health inequalities. In democratic
settings, we might expect demand for policies, in the form
of public beliefs, to play a role. Baum and Fisher28 argue
that the behavior-based policy frame that is the main alterna-
tive to the SDOH model is resilient partly because public
beliefs support it. But while some researchers have found
that members of the public are not prone to think about
health inequalities or generally understand disease as an out-
come of lifestyle or healthcare factors,28,57,58 other studies
find greater public understanding of the link between social
deprivation and ill health.59–63 Further, framing the issue of
health inequalities in terms of social-structural factors or
fairness, rather than individual responsibility, can prompt the
public to support policies aimed at reducing health inequal-
ities.64–66 Public opinion is probably not a decisive obstacle
to enacting policies that would reduce health inequalities,
then. However, other aspects of the political environment
may well be.
One important component of the wider political environ-
ment is the dominant neoliberal economic policy paradigm,
which much research has shown erects obstacles to reducing
health inequalities.67–71 Many of the policy professionals I
interviewed described neoliberal practices and policies that
reinforce health inequalities and prevent effective govern-
ment actions to redress them. Key examples of such prac-
tices included campaign contributions and direct lobbying
pressure on policy-makers for open markets from purveyors
of health-harming products and trade agreements that
enforced privatization of health services.
Constraints on macroeconomic policy deriving from
domestic and international financial markets or international
financial institutions could also contribute to reticence about
implementing bold redistributive policies designed to reduce
inequalities in the upstream determinants of health. In all but
the most extreme cases of financial bailouts, however, the
motive force here lies in ideas and anticipated reactions, rather
than in direct conditionality. Given the status of neoliberalism
as an epistemically privileged master-narrative,72 it is plausible
that neoliberal ideas might have their own motive force.
However, as Berman points out, to understand how neoliberal
(or other) ideas come to influence policy, we need to see ‘how
ideas become embedded in particular groups, organizations, or
structures, thereby outlasting the initial conditions shaping their
emergence.’73 It is clear that the main articulators of the health
inequalities problem frame, epidemiologists and public health
professionals are simply not as well-integrated into policy-
making in most countries as are medical actors, central banks
or lobbyists for multinational corporations; and policy-making
structures tend to be organized around an ecology dominated
by medical, rather than the social determinants of health. Both
of these conditions make it more likely that policies will match
the dominant neoliberal meta-frame rather than the social
determinants health inequalities frame.74

 Conclusion
Health inequalities may be a politically appealing problem
frame, making palatable certain proposals to reduce inequality
that would be politically infeasible if posed baldly as redistribu-
tion. But health inequality is also a complicated, perhaps even
‘wicked,’ problem, and reframing social inequality as a problem
of health inequality introduces a great deal of complexity. It
implies a need for difficult coordination across policy sectors,
and makes the problem at hand seem unamenable to policy
intervention, all of which makes it more difficult to combat
the power of neoliberal ideas and actors already present within
the policy-making arena. The health inequalities problem
frame contributes to medicalizing policy-making around the
issue of social inequality, recruiting into the inequality policy
space actors whose worldviews, expertize and institutional
power bases may clash with or overwhelm those of other pol-
icy actors whose top priority is social equality more broadly.
All these institutional and political obstacles help to explain
why, even when policy-makers adopt and promote the prob-
lem of health inequalities in part in order to address the under-
lying inequalities, this problem frame can fail to produce a
policy response that would redress either health inequalities or
the fundamental causes of these inequalities.
Where does this leave political actors who might have
hoped to use the health inequalities frame strategically, as a
way to reintroduce redistributive policy after three decades
of neoliberal hegemony? Policy-makers interested in redu-
cing either social inequalities or health inequalities would do
well to eschew the health inequalities problem frame and
instead adopt a more ‘traditional’ plan for reducing social
inequality consisting of taxation, redistribution and labor
market regulation. These policies may seem too politically
risky to consider, and near impossible to enact in a neo-
liberal era; but they have the benefit of being relatively
straightforward to imagine and to implement by a single
ministry.
The movement for social equity faces a difficult task of
political navigation. On one side lurks the shoal of Scylla, a
health inequality frame that is politically attractive but makes
policy-making technically difficult. On the other swirls
Charybdis, redistributive social policies that threaten to
drown supporters of equity in the ire of powerful market
actors. Scylla, I would contend, is ultimately the more dan-
gerous of the two obstacles. Getting around Charybdis safely
will require political ingenuity and favorable winds; but the
passage is ultimately made easier by the presence of policy
tools like taxation and labor market regulation that are rela-
tively straightforward and within the range of technical feasi-
bility for economic policy-makers.
