ABSTRACT
Investigation of Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum, the spirochete
that causes syphilis, has been hindered by an inability to culture the organism con-
tinuously in vitro despite more than a century of effort. In this study, long-term loga-
rithmic multiplication of T. pallidum was attained through subculture every 6 to
7 days and periodic feeding using a modified medium (T. pallidum culture me-
dium 2 [TpCM-2]) with a previously described microaerobic, rabbit epithelial cell co-
incubation system. Currently, cultures have maintained continuous growth for over
6 months with full retention of viability as measured by motility and rabbit infectiv-
ity. This system has been applied successfully to the well-studied Nichols strain of
T. pallidum, as well as to two recent syphilis isolates, UW231B and UW249B. Light
microscopy and cryo-electron microscopy showed that in vitro-cultured T. pallidum
retains wild-type morphology. Further refinement of this long-term subculture sys-
tem is expected to facilitate study of the physiological, genetic, pathological, immu-
nologic, and antimicrobial susceptibility properties of T. pallidum subsp. pallidum
and closely related pathogenic Treponema species and subspecies.
IMPORTANCE
Syphilis, a sexually transmitted disease with a global distribution, is
caused by a spiral-shaped bacterium called Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum.
Previously, T. pallidum was one of the few major bacterial pathogens that had not
been cultured long-term in vitro (in a test tube), greatly hindering efforts to better
understand this organism and the disease that it causes. In this article, we report the
successful long-term cultivation of T. pallidum in a tissue culture system, a finding
that is likely to enhance our ability to obtain new information applicable to the di-
agnosis, treatment, and prevention of syphilis.

S
yphilis is a multistage sexually transmitted infection of worldwide importance, with
estimates of total disease burden ranging from 18 to 56 million individuals (1–4).
Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum (T. pallidum), the causative agent of syphilis, was
first identified by Schaudinn and Hoffman in 1905 (5, 6) as “very light, thin spiraled
microorganisms, turning around their largest length and moving back and forth.”Rapid
progress in the study of this bacterium was made within 5 years, with the verification
of the presence of spirochetes in experimentally infected animals by Metchnikoff and
Roux (7), the invention of dark-field microscopy for easy visualization of T. pallidum by
Karl Landsteiner, development of the first serological test for syphilis by von Wasser-
mann et al. (8), and the introduction of arsphenamine as an effective, relatively nontoxic
antisyphilis agent by Paul Ehrlich (9, 10). Successful culture of T. pallidum was reported
almost immediately and during the subsequent decades (11, 12), but these reports

 were found to be either irreproducible or the result of contamination with nonpatho-
genic Treponema species that colonize human skin (13). During the 1970s, progress was
made in characterizing some T. pallidum physiological properties, most notably its
microaerophilic nature and improved survival in the presence of mammalian cells (14).
In 1981, Fieldsteel, Cox, and Moeckli (15) reported the consistent occurrence of up
to 100-fold multiplication of T. pallidum in a coculture system consisting of Sf1Ep
cottontail rabbit epithelial cells, a modified tissue culture medium with heat-inactivated
fetal bovine serum, dithiothreitol (DTT) as a reducing agent, and a microaerobic
atmosphere containing 1.5% O2. These results were reproduced in hundreds of exper-
iments (primarily by the Cox and Norris groups) and reported in over 25 publications
(reviewed in references 14 and 16). However, treponemal multiplication and survival
were limited to 12 to 18 days, despite efforts to refine this system. Attempts to
subculture T. pallidum provided little improvement in the cumulative fold increase or
survival of the bacterium (14, 16, 17). The same limitation has existed for the closely
related organisms that cause yaws (T. pallidum subsp. pertenue), bejel (T. pallidum
subsp. endemicum), pinta (Treponema carateum), and venereal spirochetosis in rabbits
and hares (T. paraluiscuniculi) (18, 19). The inability to culture these organisms contin-
uously in vitro has necessitated their propagation in rabbits for use in research, greatly
hindering investigation of these important pathogens.
In this study, we utilized a modification of the method described by Fieldsteel et al.
(15, 16) to achieve reproducible, long-term multiplication of T. pallidum subsp. pallidum
in a tissue culture system. In ongoing experiments, T. pallidum multiplication and full
viability have been maintained for up to 27 passages over a period of 6 months. Results
obtained with the Nichols reference strain have been verified using two recent T. pal-
lidum isolates. The in vitro-cultured treponemes retained their characteristic ultrastruc-
ture (as determined by cryoelectron microscopy) and full infectivity (as demonstrated
by rabbit inoculation experiments). The availability of this culture system is likely to
lead to a better understanding of T. pallidum physiology, structure, gene expression,
regulatory pathways, pathogenesis, immunologic properties, and antimicrobial suscep-
tibility.
RESULTS
Long-term culture of T. pallidum. T. pallidum subsp. pallidum Nichols, isolated
from the cerebrospinal fluid of a neurosyphilis patient in 1912 (20) and the reference
strain for this subspecies, was utilized for most experiments, whereas strains UW231B
and UW249B, isolated from the blood of untreated syphilis patients in Seattle, WA, were
used to examine the applicability of the culture method to other syphilis strains. These
and (to our knowledge) all other available T. pallidum strains were isolated and
propagated by inoculation of rabbits. The in vitro cultures were initiated with frozen
preparations of T. pallidum previously extracted from infected rabbit testes and stored
at �80°
C.
In preliminary studies, multiple modifications of the T. pallidum cultivation medium
(TpCM) described by Cox (16) were examined to determine their effects on treponemal
survival and growth. The basal medium of TpCM consists of Eagle’
s minimal essential
medium (MEM) with added nonessential amino acids. We found that replacement of
the Eagle’
s MEM component with the more complex CMRL 1066 tissue culture medium
(21) resulted in increased yields and improved retention of motility of T. pallidum during
primary culture in vitro. The CoCl2, cocarboxylase, catalase, and bovine superoxide
dismutase components of TpCM did not have a measurable effect on T. pallidum in vitro
in our analysis and thus were omitted from our formulation. We have named the
modified medium TpCM-2 to reflect its similarity to the medium described by Cox (16).
A pilot experiment provided a positive indication that prolonged in vitro multipli-
cation of T. pallidum may be possible with TpCM-2 and Sf1Ep cottontail rabbit epithelial
cells. In this study, two different series of subcultures were initiated from a primary
T. pallidum Nichols culture: one with sequential subcultures on days 8, 16, and 28, and
the other on days 18 and 26. Significant multiplication occurred in each of the

 subcultures, except for the last transfer in the series consisting of days 8, 16, and 28 (see
Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). In addition, motility was retained at above 50%
until 28 days. Cumulative fold increase (the product of the fold increase values for each
subculture) provided a measure of the sustained multiplication under these conditions
(Fig. S1C). While the primary culture increase reached a maximum of 57-fold, the two
subculture series achieved cumulative fold increases of 978 and 1,105, respectively.
Motility in the subcultures was lost by day 36. We therefore reasoned that prolonged
survival and growth of T. pallidum may be obtained by shortening the subculture
interval and thus maintaining conditions that are more homeostatic.
The current culture procedure (outlined in Table 1) utilizes coincubation of T. pal-
lidum with Sf1Ep cells in TpCM-2 at 34°
C in a microaerobic atmosphere consisting of
1.5% O2 and 5% CO2, with the balance consisting of N2. Under these conditions, ~90%
of the treponemes adhere to the surface of the Sf1Ep cells and multiply by binary
fission. T. pallidum organisms were dissociated from the Sf1Ep cells by treatment with
trypsin and EDTA, and the resulting suspension was used for quantitation by dark-field
microscopy and the transfer of organisms to fresh subcultures. In some experiments, a
portion of the medium was replaced with fresh TpCM-2 at 3 to 4 days. The typical
subculture interval was 6 to 7 days, although this period could be prolonged if the
T. pallidum concentration was low. Triplicate cultures in 6-well cluster dishes were
utilized for each time point with each culture being used to inoculate a separate
subculture, thus maintaining three parallel biological replicates. Details regarding the
methodologies utilized are described in Materials and Methods.
Using these conditions, all five of the T. pallidum cultivation experiments that we
have undertaken to date have exhibited consistent, long-term multiplication with
retention of motility (Table 2); four of these cultures are still ongoing. The current
results of our longest-ongoing T. pallidum culture experiment (experiment 1 [Exp. 1])
are depicted in Fig. 1. The numbers of T. pallidum organisms per culture are shown in

 (labeled “500 �l,” from the total trypsinized culture volume of ~2.4 ml) was used.
However, we noted that these cultures reached a maximum number of roughly 5 � 107
T. pallidum organisms per culture and exhibited some loss of motility. Therefore,
beginning on day 24, parallel subcultures were begun that contained a lower inoculum
of 0.1 to 0.25 ml (“low inoculum”). The transferred volume was typically 0.25 ml for
these cultures but was adjusted to a lower volume if a particularly high T. pallidum
concentration was observed during a brief microscopic examination. Note that a given
volume of trypsinized culture was used rather than adjustment of the inoculum to a
certain number of bacteria (which would require an accurate microscopic concentra-
tion determination) to minimize the transfer time and thus the exposure to atmo-
spheric levels of oxygen. A typical transfer time was 20 to 30 min.
In this representative experiment, the primary cultures multiplied exponentially for
the first 12 days, at which time growth slowed and motility decreased (Fig. 1). In
contrast, continued multiplication of T. pallidum occurred in each of the subsequent 25
subcultures, indicating that the replicative potential of the treponemes was retained. In
addition, motility (as a measure of cellular viability) was generally maintained at a high
level, whereas the motility of the primary cultures decreased dramatically on day 12
(Fig. 1B). A decrease in motility did occur in the subcultures on day 74, when the
subculture interval was inadvertently extended to 9 days. However, viability recovered
during the following two subcultures, indicating the outgrowth of a subset of organ-
isms that had not been irreversibly damaged. The reduction in the percentage of motile
organisms correlated with an increase in the average generation time over the 7-day
period of the subsequent subculture (Fig. 1C). Thereafter, the growth of T. pallidum
recovered to the prior rate. At the time of writing, this experiment had been ongoing
for 187 days, or over 6 months.
The value corresponding to the cumulative generations for the high-inoculum
(500-�l) cultures lagged behind that obtained with the parallel low-inoculum cultures
(Fig. 2). Excluding the variant subcultures on days 74 and 80, the average generation
time ranged from 37 to 106 h for 0.5-ml-inoculum cultures (mean � standard deviation
[SD] � 63 � 18 h) and from 30 to 66 h for the low-inoculum cultures (41 � 8 h) for the
time points shared by the two subculture series. A t test comparison showed that the
generation time was significantly lower (P � 0.05) in the subcultures receiving a lower
inoculum, most likely because optimal multiplication was sustained for a longer time
due to slower depletion of required nutrients or accumulation of toxic compounds. For
this reason, the high-inoculum portion of this experiment was discontinued on day 116.

cultures occurred only within the first 12 days. The generations accumulated more rapidly in the low-inoculum cultures than in the

 Very similar results were obtained in a replicate experiment (Exp. 2), which is
ongoing at 189 days of culture and 27 subcultures (Fig. S2). Multiplication and motility
have been consistently maintained except for a downturn on days 98 to 105 for
unknown reasons, with a subsequent recovery. Overall, this experiment has shown a
cumulative fold increase of 2.4 �1031, or 104 generations.
Requirement for mammalian cells. Experiments were performed to examine
whether TpCM-2 medium alone could support the long-term survival and growth of
T. pallidum Nichols in the absence of mammalian cells (i.e., in axenic cultures). Quan-
titative PCR was also used to determine the number of T. pallidum genome equivalents
per culture during the course of these studies. The results of two experiments (Fig. 3;
see also Fig. S3) were similar and showed that small (2.0-fold and 2.2-fold) but
statistically significant (P values of 0.013 and 0.039) increases in the number of
T. pallidum organisms occurred in axenic cultures during the first 6 days of culture.
Motility was also maintained at high levels (99% and 95%) at this time point. However,
the T. pallidum yield was not significantly higher than the inoculum on day 12 of
culture, and motility had decreased (43% and 83%). Interestingly, the number of
genome equivalents per cell increased dramatically in the axenic T. pallidum popula-
tion, while remaining relatively stable in the actively multiplying T. pallidum population
in the Sf1Ep cocultures. Thus, only modest multiplication (roughly 1 cell division)
occurred in the axenic cultures in these experiments, but this limitation was apparently
not due to the lack of genomic replication.
Successful freezing and recovery of in vitro-cultured T. pallidum. In vitro-
cultured T. pallidum Nichols organisms from a subculture harvested on day 54 of Exp.
1 were frozen at �80°
C in TpCM-2 with 15% glycerol. The organisms were thawed
25 days later and used to inoculate fresh cultures (Exp. 3). The thawed T. pallidum
exhibited only a 3.1-fold increase during the first 7-day culture period but consistently
showed a high replication rate thereafter (e.g., a 14.1-fold increase, or 3.8 doublings,
during the second 7-day period). This culture has been passaged continuously for
119 days (17 subcultures) and has undergone a 2.4 �1019-fold cumulative fold increase
or 26 generations (Table 2; see also Fig. S4). Thus, in vitro-cultured T. pallidum can be
successfully frozen and recovered, raising the possibility of continuous in vitro culture
of T. pallidum without a need for rabbit inoculation.
Culture of additional T. pallidum strains. To determine whether this in vitro
culture technique can be applied to other T. pallidum strains, we performed long-term

cultures. Fold increases are shown in parentheses. The axenic cultures were initiated in parallel with the
Sf1Ep cocultures in experiment 1 (Table 2) (Fig. 1), using the same frozen stock of T. pallidum. (A) The
number of T. pallidum organisms per culture increased only ~2-fold in axenic cultures but increased over
55-fold for cocultures with Sf1Ep cells. Genome equivalent (Equiv.) increases were similar to bacterial cell
number increases for the Sf1Ep cocultures but were somewhat higher than the cell number increases for
the axenic cultures. (B) Numbers of genome Equiv. per cell remained stable for the exponentially growing
cocultures but increased for the axenic cultures. T. pallidum per-culture and genome equivalent values

 culture experiments with two recent syphilis isolates, UW231B and UW249B. These
strains are members of the so-called SS14 clade of T. pallidum subsp. pallidum that is
currently predominant in the United States, Europe, and many other regions (22–24). As
with the prior studies with the Nichols strain, cultures were inoculated with frozen
preparations of the UW231B and UW249B strains prepared from infected rabbit testes.
The in vitro cultures of UW231B and UW249B exhibited long-term multiplication with
retention of motility and wild-type morphology. The UW231B cultures are ongoing at
70 days of culture with 9 passages, with a cumulative fold increase of 2.6 � 109 (31
generations) (Table 2; see also Fig. S5). Similar results were obtained with UW249B
(Table 2; see also Fig. S6), but this culture series was discontinued on day 46 due to
subsequent fungal contamination.
Consistency of in vitro culture. The growth curves in cumulative generations of the
five long-term cultures listed in Table 2 are provided in Fig. 4. The results obtained were
remarkably consistent, exhibiting very similar growth rates over time. At the time of this
writing, two cultures (Exp. 1 and Exp. 2) have now been maintained for over 6 months
(187 and 189 days, respectively). Additionally, over 20 “side” experiments have been
performed with these long-term cultures and yielded similar results in terms of reten-
tion of viability and multiplication. Up to 2.4 �1031-fold increases, or 104 generations
(cell divisions), have been observed in serially passaged cultures to date (Table 2), with
no apparent change in growth rates or reduction in motility (as a measure of viability)
over time. By comparison, growth in nonpassaged (primary) cultures was limited to
134- to 163-fold increases (7.2 to 7.3 generations), with loss of motility and decreases
in cell numbers after 20 to 31 days.
The doubling time of a bacterium is defined as the time between cell divisions
during optimal growth, i.e., the mid-log phase of exponential growth. Magnuson et al.
(25) determined the doubling time of T. pallidum during rabbit infection to be 30 h
using the relationship between dosage and the time of dermal lesion development,
whereas Cumberland and Turner (26) calculated a remarkably similar value of 33 h
based on extraction and enumeration of organisms at different time points following
intratesticular inoculation of rabbits. In our in vitro cultures, we have thus far deter-
mined cell numbers only at the beginning and end of 6-to-7-day subculture intervals,
likely including the lag, exponential, and early stationary phases. Therefore, we can

 calculate only the average generation time for each subculture, which could be
expected to be higher than the exponential doubling time. The average generation
times over the entire course of experiments 1 to 5 ranged from 44 to 52 h (Table 2).
However, as noted previously, some subcultures had markedly higher generation times
(see, e.g., Fig. 1C). To estimate the minimum generation time, the lowest five subculture
generation time values were averaged for each experiment (Table 2); only the lowest
3 generation times were included for Exp. 5, because the experiment had only six time
points. For the Nichols strain (experiments 1, 2, and 3), the minimum generation time
values were 33.3, 33.3, and 35.6 h, respectively, whereas somewhat higher values were
obtained with strains UW231B (43.8 h) and UW249B (45.8 h). The results for UW231B
and UW249B are based on single experiments; therefore, we do not know at this point
if this dissimilarity is due to experimental variation or to true biological differences in
growth rates. Nevertheless, the results obtained to date indicate that the estimated
multiplication rate of T. pallidum in vitro is quite similar to that which occurs during
experimental rabbit infection.
Infectivity. To determine whether T. pallidum remained infectious during in vitro
culture, two experiments (A and B) were performed in which serial dilutions of
T. pallidum Nichols from 45- and 116-day in vitro cultures were inoculated intradermally
into the shaved backs of rabbits, and the injection sites were observed daily for the
development of lesions. Under these conditions, the time of lesion development is
inversely proportional to the number of infectious organisms injected, i.e., higher
dosages produce lesions more rapidly (25, 27, 28). The results demonstrated that the in
vitro-cultured T. pallidum remained fully infectious, with dilutions calculated to contain
as few as one organism yielding lesions (Fig. 5) (Table 3). The times of lesion develop-
ment obtained in a prior study with freshly extracted, rabbit-derived T. pallidum Nichols
were 6.2, 8.9, 14.8, and 17.2 days for inocula of 105, 104, 103, and 2 � 102, respectively
(28); the values obtained in the experiments reported here were comparable. In both
experiments, sites injected with as few as 100 organisms developed lesions at all sites
(Table 3). In experiment A (day 45 organisms), 2 of 4 sites inoculated with 10 T. pallidum
FIG 5 T. pallidum subsp. pallidum Nichols organisms cultured in vitro for 116 days were fully infectious
in the rabbit intradermal infection model. This photograph of one of the three rabbits in infectivity
experiment A (Table 3) was taken on day 45 postinoculation. Paired sites were inoculated intradermally
with the dosages shown. Sites inoculated with higher doses had undergone ulceration, as is typical of
intradermal infections in rabbits.

 were positive; in experiment B (day 116 bacteria), all sites injected with 10 organisms
were positive and 3 of 6 sites were positive at the one-organism injection sites. Thus,
the 50% infective dose (ID50) of in vitro-cultured T. pallidum was 10 organisms in
experiment A and was 1 organism in experiment B and can be considered to be �10
organisms. Needle aspirates from representative lesions at each dosage were consis-
tently positive for motile treponemes by dark-field microscopy. Exceptions were the
lesions from the lowest positive dosages in the two experiments, most likely because
the immune response against the previously developing lesions limited the concen-
tration of T. pallidum and the lesion size at the lower-dose sites (Fig. 5). Overall, these
results demonstrate that T. pallidum organisms cultured in vitro in our studies retain
their ability to multiply and to cause disease in a widely used animal model of syphilitic
infection.
Bacterial ultrastructure. T. pallidum exhibited characteristic morphology and vig-
orous motility during the course of in vitro culture, as examined by dark-field micros-
copy (Fig. 6). Regions of helical and planar wave morphology, as have been described
previously for both T. pallidum (29) and Borrelia burgdorferi (30), were observed. Some
organisms had circularized to form ring-shaped structures. Tangled clusters of 2 to 10
bacteria were also present. All of these forms are also commonly observed in T. palli-

 dum extracted from infected rabbit tissue (not shown). Cell length was variable,
reflecting a mixture of organisms in different stages of cell elongation and division.
Cryo-electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) was utilized to determine whether in vitro-
cultured T. pallidum retained the characteristic structure of the organism. As shown in
Fig. 7 and the cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) series in Movies S1 and S2 in the
supplemental material, T. pallidum Nichols cultured for 52 days in vitro exhibited a
structure that was indistinguishable from that of T. pallidum extracted from infected
rabbit tissue (31). The outer membrane, periplasmic flagella, peptidoglycan layer, inner
membrane, chemotaxis arrays, conical tip organelles, and cytoplasmic filaments are all
clearly discernible and identical in appearance to those in rabbit-derived specimens.
Interestingly, particles ~10 nm in diameter resembling small vesicles appeared to be
bound to the outer membrane (Fig. 7). Figure 7C shows a region of an organism in
which the fragile outer membrane has been stripped off, as commonly occurs in
T. pallidum preparations. That region is devoid of the small particles, indicating that the
particles are binding to the outer membrane surface.
Parameters affecting in vitro growth of T. pallidum. We have begun the process
of examining factors that affect T. pallidum multiplication in this in vitro system. It had
been noted in previous studies that T. pallidum growth in primary cultures was limited
when the concentration of bacteria was initially high (14–17). We reasoned that the
availability of nutrients was limiting and therefore examined whether simply increasing
the volume of TpCM-2 in the cultures could increase the yield and survival of T. palli-
dum. Increasing the volume of medium in 6-well cultures from 2 ml to 3 or 4 ml resulted
in a concomitant increase in the yield per culture (Fig. 8). We therefore began to utilize
4 ml of TpCM-2 per culture in subsequent experiments.

 The yield per culture could also be increased by enlarging the size of the cultures
from the 6-well cluster dish format (9-cm2 surface area) to 75-cm2 tissue culture flasks.
Each 75-cm2 flask has a 9.3-fold-higher surface area than a well in a 6-well cluster dish.
A proportionately increased number of Sf1Ep cells, a higher medium volume (15 ml),
and a larger inoculum were used, essentially “supersizing” the cultures. Yields were
increased by roughly 7-fold to 10-fold in the 75-cm2 cultures in comparison with 6-well
culture controls (see Table S1 in the supplemental material).
DISCUSSION
Here, we report the first consistent long-term in vitro cultivation of T. pallidum subsp.
pallidum. The successful culture of recent syphilis isolates UW231B and UW249B as well
as the long-established Nichols strain indicates that the cultivation procedure will likely
be applicable to other syphilis isolates. Given the extreme similarity of all the T. pallidum
subspecies, T. carateum, and T. paraluiscuniculi, it is probable that the same conditions
will be effective in propagating all the members of this group of pathogens, as will be
examined in future studies.
The culture method used was strongly based on the prior studies by A. Howard
Fieldsteel, David L. Cox, and their coworkers, who systematically established the
requirements for growth of T. pallidum in primary cultures. The extended in vitro
survival of T. pallidum in the presence of mammalian cells had been noted by several
groups (32–37), and examination of several cell cultures indicated that Sf1Ep cells
performed better than other cell types in this aspect (most likely because of their low
growth rate and low metabolism). Fieldsteel et al. (37) used oxygen gradients formed
in Leighton tubes to demonstrate that microaerobic conditions further prolonged
survival and apparent multiplication. It was also noted that only certain commercial
fetal bovine serum (FBS) lots supported T. pallidum viability (38). By combining these

quantities of T. pallidum Nichols were inoculated into triplicate 9-cm2 Sf1Ep cell cocultures containing 2,

on day 7. (A) Increased culture yield with higher medium volumes. (B) High retention of motility in all

 components with Eagle’
s MEM and DTT to decrease the presence of reactive oxygen
species, consistent in vitro multiplication was achieved and reproduced in many
experiments. However, attempts to obtain continued growth through subculturing
were generally unsuccessful, with the combined yields of the primary and passaged
cultures rarely exceeding that of the primary culture alone. Cox obtained enhanced
survival and growth with subculture in 4 experiments in which up to 2,000-fold
increases over a 17-to-30-day period were observed (reviewed in reference 14). How-
ever, these results were not reproduced in subsequent experiments (14).
We believe that the key to achieving long-term culture of T. pallidum in the current
study is the combination of the use of the TpCM-2 modified medium and the main-
tenance of near-homeostatic conditions through regular subculture and partial me-
dium replacement as needed. TpCM-2 differs from its precursor, TpCM, by substitution
of Eagle’
s MEM with CMRL 1066 medium as the basal medium and the omission of
some of the TpCM additives (Table 4). CMRL 1066 medium was selected because it is
utilized as the basal medium in Barbour-Stoenner-Kelly (BSK) medium, which is widely
used for culture of Borrelia (relapsing fever) and Borreliella (Lyme disease) isolates (39,
40). Compared to MEM, CMRL contains additional nutrients, including nucleic acid
bases, nucleosides, cocarboxylase, coenzyme A, flavin adenine dinucleotide, NAD,
NADP, Na acetate, Na glucuronate, and the fatty acid mixture Tween 80; some of the
shared components are also present at different concentrations. Further analysis will be
needed to determine (i) if the CMRL-MEM substitution is required for long-term
T. pallidum culture and, if so, (ii) what CMRL component(s) is responsible for enhanced
T. pallidum survival and growth. The other factor that appears to be important in
prolonged survival and growth is regular subculture at 6-to-7-day intervals. The rela-
tively short time between subcultures limits both the depletion of nutrients and the
development of toxic conditions, e.g., changes in pH and accumulation of toxic
by-products. It should be noted, however, that the subculture interval can be increased
when the number of T. pallidum organisms in the culture is low and partial medium
replacement is utilized. For example, in some of our low-inoculum experiments the
level in the inocula became �106 per culture. To bolster these cultures, they were at
times extended by up to 15 days with partial medium replacement at 4-to-7-day
intervals (see, e.g., Fig. 1, low inoculum, days 59 to 74).
Another observation was that a maximum yield of T. pallidum organisms per culture
occurred in standard 9-cm2 cultures with 2 ml of TpCM-2; the yield per culture was
limited despite inoculum size when all other conditions are held constant. We found
that a simple increase in the volume of medium resulted in a proportionately improved
yield when a high inoculum was used (Fig. 8). Therefore, it appears that T. pallidum itself
consumes nutrients and/or alters culture conditions in a way that limits its in vitro
growth, as is the case for most bacterial cultures. The yield of T. pallidum organisms per
culture could also be increased by using 75-cm2 flasks and concomitant increases in
inoculum size, medium volume, and Sf1Ep cell numbers (Table S1).
Optimal growth of T. pallidum in this system required the presence of Sf1Ep cells,

 with little multiplication occurring in parallel axenic cultures (Fig. 3; see also Fig. S3 in
the supplemental material). It is of interest that the number of genome Equiv. per cell
increased dramatically in axenic cultures, whereas this value remains relatively constant
at ~3 genome Equiv. per cell in parallel cultures with Sf1Ep cells. Indeed, it had been
observed previously that T. pallidum in an axenic environment continues to synthesize
DNA (and RNA) for up to 6 days, despite the fact that the number of cells did not
increase in these experiments (41, 42). Thus, the barrier to multiplication in the axenic
cultures performed to date is not likely to be due to defects in genome replication.
Direct interaction through adherence between Sf1Ep cells and T. pallidum is apparently
required for promotion of treponemal multiplication in that separation of T. pallidum
from the cell monolayer in Transwell chambers prevented growth and shortened
survival (unpublished observations).
We speculate that T. pallidum may directly acquire certain nutrients, such as lipids,
through direct interaction with host cells. It had been shown previously that B. burg-
dorferi can obtain lipids during direct interaction with mammalian cells (43) and that
T. pallidum can acquire fluorescently labeled fatty acids directly from the surrounding
medium (44). Matthews et al. (45) found that the lipid content of T. pallidum purified
from infected rabbit testes had high proportions of cholesterol, which was most likely
acquired directly from the host rather than synthesized from fatty acids. These are
important observations, since neither of these organisms contains the genes required
for fatty acid synthesis (46, 47). T. pallidum, like other treponemes (48–50), most likely
acquires lipids bound to serum albumin, which acts as a detoxifying agent (51); perhaps
this mechanism is supplemented by direct acquisition from host cells. The bound
particles or vesicles observed by cryo-electron microscopy (Fig. 7; see also Movies S1
and S2 in the supplemental material) could conceivably represent a means of nutrient
acquisition.
T. pallidum is a microaerophilic organism that requires low (1.5% to 5%) concentra-
tions of oxygen for long-term survival and growth and yet is extremely sensitive to the
toxic effects of atmospheric levels of oxygen (16, 36, 42, 52–55). In 1974, Cox and Barber
(54) demonstrated that T. pallidum consumed O2, but even today we do not have a
good explanation of how oxygen is utilized. T. pallidum lacks genes encoding the
tricarboxylic cycle, cytochromes, or other components of typical bacterial oxidative
phosphorylation pathways (47). One hypothesis is that O2 is used as an electron
acceptor to maintain appropriate NADH/NAD� levels through the action of NADH
oxidase (56). T. pallidum lacks genes encoding superoxide dismutase or catalase but
may utilize neelaredoxin to provide protective activity against superoxide and other
reactive oxygen species (ROS) (57). Reducing compounds such as DTT in TpCM and
TpCM-2 scavenge ROS and play an important role in prolonging T. pallidum survival in
vitro (16). It is also possible that host cells in vivo (and Sf1Ep cells in the in vitro culture
system) are active in scavenging of ROS and thus in protecting T. pallidum from these
toxic compounds.
Sf1Ep cells are better at supporting the survival and growth of T. pallidum than are
all other cell types that have been examined (58). The particular capability of Sf1Ep cells
to support T. pallidum multiplication may be related to their relatively low growth rate
and low metabolic activity. Sf1Ep cell cultures can survive quite well for 2 weeks, with
little change in medium parameters such as pH. It is likely that other mammalian cell
types deplete nutrients and change medium conditions more rapidly, limiting their
efficacy in supporting T. pallidum growth. We are hopeful that future studies will
identify the nutrients or protective activities provided by Sf1Ep cells and thus permit
long-term axenic survival and growth.
Retention of infectivity in the rabbit model and structural integrity are important
indicators that in vitro-cultured T. pallidum organisms maintain wild-type properties. In
future analyses, the genome sequence of long-term-cultured treponemes will be
compared with those of rabbit-propagated organisms to determine whether any
sequence differences are evident. However, selection of a small subset of variant cells

 capable of growing in vitro seems implausible, because exponential multiplication is
evident within days after the inoculation of cultures with rabbit-derived treponemes.
The members of the T. pallidum group of pathogens represent an extreme in terms
of host dependence. These bacteria have adapted to survival only in mammalian tissue,
relying on the host for provision of nucleic acid bases, fatty acids, most amino acids,
and glucose as an energy source (14, 47, 56) as well as for the maintenance of
near-homeostatic conditions in terms of temperature, osmolarity, oxygen and CO2
levels, and pH. The genus Treponema is a genetically diverse group whose known
members are primarily host-associated organisms, including commensal skin organ-
isms, oral treponemes, intestinal spirochetes, oral- and hoof-associated organisms
involved in polymicrobial infections, and termite gut symbionts (59). However, T. cal-
daria, T. stenostreptum, and T. zuelzerae were recently recognized as free-living Trepo-
nema species (60); many more environmental species are likely, as indicated by the
identification of multiple Treponema genomes in a microbiome study of water well
sediment in Rifle, CO (61). Progressive genome reduction is extreme in this genus,
resulting in decreases from roughly 4 Mb for environmental and termite-associated
treponemes to only 1.1 Mb for the T. pallidum group, with intermediate genome sizes
occurring in other mammal-associated Treponema species (18). Thus, T. pallidum has
lost genes for most biosynthetic pathways, stress response pathways, and complex
energy production pathways while retaining the minimum complement of genes
required for survival, proliferation, and transmission in the near-homeostatic environ-
ment of mammalian tissue, including those encoding transporters and efficient motility
and chemotaxis systems.
In summary, the modification of the system used by Fieldsteel et al. (15) described
here will likely facilitate the characterization of the T. pallidum subspecies, T. carateum,
and the rabbit and hare-infecting Treponema species. Future studies will include
application of this approach to culture of T. pallidum subsp. pertenue and subsp.
endemicum, which would in turn provide new avenues for the study of yaws and bejel.
It is likely that the rabbit and hare pathogen (provisionally renamed “T. paraluislepori-
darum” from T. paraluiscuniculi [62]) can also be cultured by this method, which may
provide new insights into the evolution of host specificity among Treponema species.
We anticipate that it will be possible to isolate T. pallidum and other pathogenic
Treponema directly from tissues or body fluids using the in vitro culture system.
Potentially, this approach also may permit the culture of the pinta organism T. cara-
teum, which has been shown to be infectious in primates but has not been propagated
in rabbits or other laboratory animals (19, 27). In vitro-cultured pathogenic treponemes
could also be used in in vitro host-pathogen interaction and immunologic studies, as
well as in vaccine development. We have already begun to utilize the culture system for
the following purposes: delineation of the nutrients required for in vitro growth;
comparison of the transcriptome and proteome of in vitro-cultured T. pallidum with
those of rabbit-propagated organisms; cloning of pathogenic Treponema by limiting
dilution; genome sequencing of in vitro-cultured T. pallidum; and antimicrobial suscep-
tibility testing. Random and targeted mutagenesis studies may also be possible using
the T. pallidum culture system. However, the current procedure is still complex, due to
the requirement for tissue culture cells and a microaerobic environment. This aspect
may hinder its widespread use by research laboratories, as well as its potential
application to clinical uses. Therefore, the primary goal remains the development of an
axenic system that supports the long-term culture of pathogenic Treponema species,
thereby further simplifying the study of these enigmatic organisms.

 FBS (51) at 37°
C in air with 5% CO2. Low-passage Sf1Ep cells grow slowly and were subcultured at 1:5
every 2 to 3 weeks. High-passage cells grow more rapidly and were subcultured at 1:20 every week. Cells
were fed weekly by replacement of one-half of the medium volume.
Bacteria. Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum Nichols, initially isolated from the cerebrospinal
fluid of a neurosyphilis patient in Baltimore, MD, in 1912 (20), was obtained from J. N. Miller at the UCLA
Geffen School of Medicine. The UW231B and UW249B strains were isolated in 2004 from the blood of
untreated syphilis patients in Seattle, WA, and were the kind gift of L. C. Tantalo, S. K. Sahi, and C. M.
Marra (University of Washington [UW] School of Medicine). T. pallidum strains were maintained by
intratesticular passage in male New Zealand White rabbits (3 to 4 kg) that were housed at 16 to 18°
C and
were provided antibiotic-free food and water. Rabbits were inoculated with 2 � 107 to 5 � 107 organisms
from frozen stocks per testis. Animals infected with the Nichols strain were euthanized at the time of
peak orchitis (10 to 12 days). Infection with the UW strains was monitored by rapid plasma reagin (RPR)
test reactivity, and the animals were euthanized when a positive test result was obtained (20 to 40 days
for UW231B, 26 days for UW249B). Testes were removed aseptically, and T. pallidum organisms were
extracted from minced testes by gentle stirring in 10 ml of filter-sterilized phosphate-buffered saline (PBS;
0.154 M NaCl, 0.01 M NaHPO4, pH 7.4) with 50% heat-inactivated rabbit serum and 1 mM DTT for 10 min.
Rabbit cells were removed by centrifugation at 100 � g for 7 min. The T. pallidum suspension was
supplemented with 15% (vol/vol) sterile glycerol and stored in 1-ml aliquots at �80°
C. In vitro-cultured
T. pallidum was frozen in TpCM-2 medium supplemented with 15% glycerol.
T. pallidum cultivation medium. TpCM-2 was prepared as indicated in Table 4 1 day prior to use.
All solutions were made in cell culture-grade water (Sigma W3500) and filter sterilized. Fetal bovine
serum (FBS) lots vary considerably in their ability to support T. pallidum survival and replication (16, 38,
51). FBS lots from several suppliers were therefore prescreened for efficacy (by comparison with
previously tested lots), purchased in bulk, and heat inactivated at 56°
C for 30 min prior to use. Samples
of FBS lots that support the multiplication of T. pallidum are available upon request. The pH of the
medium was adjusted to 7.5, and the mixture was then filter sterilized with 0.22-�m-pore-size poly-
ethersulfone filters (Merck Millipore). The medium was then preequilibrated in a BBL GasPak jar in which
a vacuum was drawn five times (house vacuum; ~12 to 18 �m Hg), and the jar was refilled with 5%
CO2–95% N2 four times and a final time with 1.5% O2–5% CO2–93.5% N2. The medium was then
incubated overnight in a Forma model 3130 trigas incubator (Thermo Fisher) maintained at 34°
C with
1.5% O2–5% CO2–93.5% N2 (here referred to as the low-oxygen incubator). All subsequent steps in the
incubation of T. pallidum cultures were carried out under these conditions.
In vitro cultivation of T. pallidum. At 1 to 2 days prior to each culture initiation or passage, Sf1Ep
cells were trypsinized and seeded in tissue culture-treated 6-well cluster plates (Falcon 353046) at 0.5 to
1 � 105 cells per well. Due to the long culture period, the use of plates with low-evaporation lids is
essential. At least 3 h prior to the start of an experiment or passage, the medium in the 6-well plates
containing Sf1EP cells was removed, and the plates were rinsed with the preequilibrated TpCM-2 to
remove any traces of Sf1Ep medium prior to addition of 2 to 4 ml of the TpCM-2. Plates were then
preequilibrated in the GasPak jar as described above and transferred to the low-oxygen incubator. All
manipulations of cultures were carried out in ambient air with use of a laminar flow hood, with efforts
to limit this air exposure to �30 min to limit oxygen exposure.
Cultivation experiments were initiated using frozen aliquots of T. pallidum extracted from rabbits. A
frozen aliquot was thawed at room temperature and diluted in TpCM-2, such that each 50-to-100-�l
inoculum contained 0.5 � 106 to 1.25 � 106 T. pallidum. Sf1Ep cultures were briefly removed from the
incubator, inoculated with T. pallidum, preequilibrated, and then returned to the low-oxygen incubator.
Subculture procedure. After 6 to 7 days of incubation, T. pallidum organisms were subcultured as
follows. The TpCM-2 medium was removed and reserved. Each well was rinsed with 0.35 ml of
trypsin-EDTA (Sigma T4049), which was combined with the reserved medium. An additional 0.35 ml of
trypsin-EDTA was added, and the plates were incubated at 37°
C for 5 min. The reserved medium, the
rinsed and trypsinized Sf1Ep cells, and the T. pallidum organisms were combined and used to rinse the
culture well. An aliquot (ranging from 100 to 500 �l) of the trypsinized culture was used to inoculate new
6-well Sf1Ep cultures prepared as described above. A minimum of three wells were inoculated per
condition.
Quantification of T. pallidum. A minimum of three biological replicates were used for each
condition and time point. Trypsinized cultures were quantitated by dark-field microscopy using one of
two counting methods. Samples (10 �l) were placed under 22-by-22-mm coverslips on plain glass slides,
and the numbers of T. pallidum organisms in random fields were counted using a 40� objective lens until
10 fields or �50 organisms had been counted. The motility of each organism was also assessed. At least
three counts were made for each sample. Using calibration of the field diameter with a stage micrometer,
the concentration of organisms per milliliter was estimated as the average number per field �106/2.2.
Alternatively, cultures were quantitated using Helber counting chambers with Thoma rulings (Hawksley,
Lancing, Sussex, United Kingdom). Each culture was counted at least twice using this method. Data for
ongoing experiment 2 are those collected through 10 May 2018, whereas data from ongoing experi-
ments 1, 3, and 4 are those collected prior to 28 April 2018.
Quantitative PCR. Trypsinized cultures were centrifuged at 14,000 � g for 10 min to pellet
T. pallidum. DNA from the pelleted organisms was purified using a DNeasy kit (Qiagen), and 1/50 of the
material (2 �l of a total of 100 �l) was used for each of three quantitative PCR (qPCR) reactions per
sample. qPCR was performed using iQ Sybr green supermix on a C1000 Touch Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad).
The primers that were targeted to the T. pallidum DNA polymerase I gene (polA; TPANIC_0105) were as
follows: 6037TP1 (5=-CAGGATCCGGCATATGTCC-3=) and 6037TP2 (5=-AAGTGTGAGCGTCTCATCATTCC-3=).

 The program consisted of 95°
C for 2 min followed by 39 cycles of 95°
C for 5 s and 60°
C for 30 s. All
samples were examined in triplicate technical replicates, and standard curves using purified T. pallidum
DNA were performed for each plate and had linear regression coefficients of determination (R2) of �0.98.
No-template controls (NTC) and DNA extracted from uninfected Sf1Ep cultures were used as controls to
optimize the qPCR assay conditions.
Infectivity studies. The infectivity of cultured T. pallidum was determined by injecting serial dilutions
of the sample intradermally into the shaved backs of rabbits. Dilutions were performed in TpCM-2, and
each dilution was inoculated at duplicate sites on each rabbit. The inoculation sites were shaved and
examined daily for 45 days for the development of the occurrence of erythema and induration, which
together constitute lesion development. Needle aspirates of representative lesions (two per dosage)
were examined by dark-field microscopy for the presence of motile treponemes indicating active
treponemal infection. Rabbits were provided antibiotic-free food and water, housed at 16 to 18°
C, and
shaved daily throughout the course of the experiment. Median 50% infectious dose (ID50) values were
determined by the method of Reed and Muench (63).
Light micrography. Digital photographs were obtained as described previously (64) using a Nikon
Eclipse microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with Cytoviva X-cite 120 dark-field illumination
(Cytoviva, Auburn, AL), a CoolSNAP HQ charge-coupled-device (CCD) camera (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ),
and Nikon NIS-Elements AR3.2 software. Photography was performed with a 100� objective lens with an
internal diaphragm (Nikon) using oil immersion.
Cryo-electron microscopy. Bacterial cultures were mixed with 10-nm-diameter gold particle clus-
ters, which were used as fiducial markers, and were then deposited onto freshly glow-discharged, holey
carbon grids for 1 min. The grids were blotted with filter paper and rapidly frozen in liquid ethane, using
a gravity-driven plunger apparatus. The frozen-hydrated specimens were imaged at �170°
C using a
Polara G2 electron microscope (FEI Company) equipped with a field emission gun and a direct-detection
device (Gatan K2 Summit). The microscope was operated at 300 kV with a magnification of �9,400,
resulting in an effective pixel size of 4.5 Å at the specimen level. We used SerialEM (65) to collect
low-dose, single-axis tilt series with the dose fractionation mode at about 6-�m defocus and a
cumulative dose of ~60 e�/Å2 distributed over 35 stacks. Each stack contains ~8 images. Tilt series were
collected at angles from �51° to 51° with increments of 3°
. We used Tomoauto (66) to facilitate data
processing, which included drift correction of dose-fractionated data using Motioncorr (67) and assembly
of corrected sums into tilt series, automatic fiducial seed model generation, alignment and contrast
transfer function correction of tilt series by IMOD (68), and reconstruction of tilt series into tomograms
by Tomo3D (69).
