Abstract
Background
It is unknown whether reducing sedentary time at work and during leisure time is possible
and effective during one year.
Methods
Office workers with young children were recruited for this one-year cluster-randomized con-
trolled trial through kindergartens and primary schools from 7 clusters in the city of Jyva
¨s-
kyla
¨, Finland. After a lecture, face-to-face tailored counseling was used to set contractually
binding goals regarding reducing and breaking up sitting periods and increasing light inten-
sity physical activity during work and leisure time. Primary outcomes of total, work and lei-
sure sedentary time (<100 counts/min, cpm), light activity time (<2020 cpm), moderate-to-
vigorous activity time (MVPA) and breaks/sedentary hour were assessed with a waist-worn
Alive -accelerometer for 7 days, 5 times during the year. Anthropometrics (DXA), fasting bio-
markers and self-reported diet were assessed as secondary outcomes. Data were collected
between 2011–2013 and analyzed between 2013–2016 with a linear mixed-effects model fit
by REML using likelihood ratio test and intention-to-treat–principle.
Results
Participants from intervention (N = 71) and control (N = 62) regions were assessed at base-
line and 117 completed the study. Sedentary leisure time decreased [-21.2 (95% CI -37.3 to
-5.1) min/8 hours, likelihood ratio P<0.001] and light activity time [13.4 (-2.2 to 29.0) min/8
hours, P = 0.008] and breaks per sedentary hour [1.0 (-0.2 to 2.2), P = 0.010] increased in
the intervention group as compared to controls at 3 months. The decrease in sedentary

 leisure time was maintained throughout the year [-7.9 (-24.0 to 8.3) min/8 hours, P = 0.029].
Small decreases in the control group’s work and leisure MVPA were observed mostly at 3
months. Small favorable intervention effects were observed for fasting plasma glucose at 3
months and for leg lean mass and apoB/apoA-1 ratio at 12 months, with no changes in other
outcomes.
Conclusions
Behavioral counseling induced a small decline in sedentary leisure time throughout one
year in parents with a sedentary occupation and young children. Small concurrent changes
in different biomarkers suggest that reducing sedentary leisure time during one year may be
beneficial.

Background
A sedentary lifestyle is characterized by long periods of sitting throughout the day with rela-
tively idle muscles resulting in low energy expenditure, insulin resistance and increased risk of
chronic diseases [1]. An increasing proportion of the population is at an elevated risk of seden-
tary behavior owing to the increased prevalence of office work and sedentary leisure time hab-
its, resulting in 9–11 h of total sitting time per day [2–4]. In people who sit more than 8 hours
per day, more than 1.5 hours of moderate-intensity physical activity is required to offset the
premature mortality risk attributable to their sitting time [5]. Such a high amount of moder-
ate-intensity physical activity may be difficult to achieve, especially in people who face chal-
lenges to participate in physical activities. For example, working parents exhibit high levels of
inactivity and cite family responsibilities, lack of time and work as barriers to physical activity
[6,7]. Reductions in sedentary time may require less time commitment and be more easily
incorporated in daily routines at work and home. Targeting sedentary behaviors may therefore
be less prone to the barriers of physical activity and if proven effective, provide a feasible alter-
native to reap the health benefits.
Reducing sedentary time may be beneficial for health independent of engagement in mod-
erate intensity physical activities. Acute laboratory-based studies have been effective at improv-
ing post-meal glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity through frequent light activity bursts
which have replaced sitting time [8]. Reducing prolonged sitting over the course of a day was
found to be more effective for acute cardio-metabolic benefits than expending the same vol-
ume of energy in a single exercise bout, supporting the importance of performing light-inten-
sity activities throughout the day [9]. The suggested mechanisms include improved muscle
activity-induced insulin sensitivity and energy balance [8–10], which have the possibility to
reduce ectopic fat accumulation and improve cardio-metabolic health in the long run [11].
However, the potential long-term benefits of reducing sedentary time are based on observa-
tional findings, and the evidence from long-term interventions is lacking.
Increasing evidence from mostly short-term intervention studies suggests that the strategies
implemented to reduce sedentary time result in highly context-specific results for work or
total sedentary time, but the sustainability of acute changes, especially outside of the work-
place, are yet to be elucidated [11–14]. So far it is largely unclear whether intervention methods

 targeted separately at work and leisure sedentary time within the same study are effective in
the short and long term. This is especially important given that the health risks of sitting dur-
ing leisure time are more pronounced than those associated with work time sitting [15,16].
The purpose of this study was to test the effectiveness of behavioral counseling that included
individual-level support aimed at reducing and breaking up sedentary time, and increasing
light intensity physical activity during work and leisure time in parents with a sedentary occu-
pation and young children. Work and leisure sedentary and physical activity time were as-
sessed with waist-worn accelerometers five times during one year. Anthropometrics and
cardio-metabolic biomarkers were measured and adjusted for moderate-to-vigorous activity
and energy intake to elucidate potential health effects of reduced sedentary time. Cluster-ran-
domization was used to avoid contamination of treatment within a small city. The short-term
efficacy study of this intervention showed that this specific intervention reduced electromyog-
raphy-derived muscle inactivity by 33 min a day without increasing moderate-to-vigorous
muscle activity [17]. We hypothesized that this short-term effect would be maintained for a
year and would be accompanied by improved lipid and glucose profiles.
Methods
The methods for this cluster-randomized controlled trial have been reported earlier (InPACT,
Actions to reduce sedentary time in parents and their young children [18]). The aim of this
intervention was to counsel parents to decrease and break up their sedentary behavior, to
increase non-exercise physical activity, and to increase their children’s physical activity. The
effectiveness of the component targeting children’s behavior has been reported [19] and the
present study reports the counseling process and the main outcomes in parents. The authors
confirm that all ongoing and related trials for this intervention are registered. A delay in the
registration of the trial was due to time constraints in the study implementation. Ethical
approval for the project was received from the Ethics Committee of the Central Finland Health
Care District on March 25, 2011 (Dnro 6U/2011) and the participants signed a written in-
formed consent before participation. Reporting of this trial is guided by a checklist of the
CONSORT 2010 Statement for reporting parallel group randomized trials [20].
Setting, randomization and recruitment
The flow chart of this cluster-randomized controlled trial is presented in Fig 1, and CONSORT
as well as TIDieR checklists are provided as additional files (S1 Checklist and S2 Checklist).
Sampling was performed in the city of Jyva
¨skyla
¨ located in central Finland with a population
of 133 000. Socioeconomic status and environmental possibilities for outdoor physical activi-
ties were identified in different city regions, resulting in 14 regions located within 7 homoge-
nous clusters (2 homogenous counterpart regions within each cluster). The 14 regions were
randomized by flipping a coin to select intervention (n = 7) and control (n = 7) regions within
each cluster. Families from the intervention regions were recruited for the intervention group,
and families from the control regions for the control group between the 1st of April, 2011 and
the 30th of April, 2012. The 14 regions included a total of 8 primary schools and 21 kindergar-
tens (2–5 schools or kindergartens per cluster). The recruitment began by delivering a total of
1055 recruitment forms to parents via the primary schools and kindergartens in spring 2011,
autumn 2011 and spring 2012. Professional and health status, percent sitting time at work and
contact information were obtained using these forms. In addition, general information about
the study, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and an incentive to get diverse information about
personal health, diet and physical activity and motor skills of their children were communi-
cated. Inclusion criteria were: healthy men and women with at least one 3–8 year old child

 (one or both eligible parents were allowed to participate), parental occupation where they self-
reportedly sit more than 50% of their work time, and children in all-day day-care in kindergar-
ten or in the first grade of primary school. Exclusion criteria were: body mass index > 35 kg/
m2 (calculated based on self-reported height and weight), self-reported chronic, long-term dis-
eases, families with a pregnant mother at baseline, children with disorders that delay motor
development, and concurrent participation in another study. No monetary incentive was
offered to the participants. The researchers (AL, AP, TF) enrolled participants and performed
randomization.
People fulfilling the inclusion criteria were contacted by phone and invited to one of 14
information lectures held in April 2011-April 2012, where the procedures were explained in
detail and the first measurement time was scheduled. If people were unable to attend the lec-
ture, details of the project were explained on the phone. Finally, a total of 133 participants
were assessed at baseline between the 2nd of May, 2011 and the 2nd of May, 2012. After the
baseline, measurements were conducted every 3 months until the one-year follow-up. Fig 1
summarizes the recruitment, randomization and analysis processes. Participants and staff
were unblinded to the group allocation.
Description of the intervention
The intervention program consisted of a lecture, face-to-face discussion including goal setting,
and phone counselling (for one parent at a time). Childcare was offered during the counselling
session, but children did not attend any intervention events. The behaviour change techniques
used in the intervention were based on previous knowledge of effective interventions [21] and
theory of planned behaviour [22]. Details of the intervention procedures have been reported
previously [18].
The intervention lecture was given for a maximum of six participants at a time, within 2
weeks of the baseline measurements. During the 30 min lecture the health hazards of pro-
longed sitting and the challenges of the sitting-friendly modern environment from the adults’
perspective were described. It was underlined that the aim was to reduce and break up sitting
time by increasing light intensity activities like light ambulation, as this is the easiest way to
overcome the health hazards of prolonged sedentary time. The lecture was designed to provide
information about the behaviour-health link, to provide information on consequences, to pro-
vide information about others’ approval, to provide instructions and general encouragement,
and to emphasize identification as a role model for children [23].
The lecture was followed by face-to-face discussions with 1) one participant at a time when
discussing work time behavior and 2) parents together when discussing leisure time behaviors,
if both parents were participants. The participants were encouraged to think of feasible ways to
decrease and break up sitting time during these routines and to increase light-intensity physi-
cal activities, which were then formulated to small step progressive goals for each participant.
The specific goals for each domain were written down into an agreement document that
was signed by the participant and the researcher. The researcher transcribed the goals to a
certificate, which was subsequently delivered to the participant. The underlying theoretical
frameworks were motivational interviewing in order to provide general encouragement and
instructions, to prompt intention formation and specific goal setting, and to agree on a beha-
vioural contract [23]. The lecture and individual discussions were led by researchers (AL, AP,
TF) who had all undergone an orientation about good practices in PA counseling.
To promote compliance with the goals, a phone discussion with each participant was per-
formed after two and five months of counselling. Participants were asked to self-evaluate the
implementation of the goals (prompt review of behavioural goals). After this, perceived

 barriers were discussed and possible modifications to the goals were made (prompt barrier
identification, provide instructions, prompt specific goal setting). The behavior change tech-
niques described here were specific to parents’ sedentary and light activity time and the tech-
niques regarding children’s behavior are reported elsewhere [19].
Participants in the intervention group were encouraged to maintain the intended behavior
after the end of the counseling period. The last 6 months of the study were identical for both
groups, consisting of 9 and 12 month assessments without any counseling. At 12 months, after
the follow-up assessments were completed, the participants in the control group received a
shortened version of the counseling.
Protocol and data
The protocol included data collection at the research laboratory of the University of Jyva
¨skyla
¨,
and measurements of sedentary time and physical activity during normal daily life. Each mea-
surement was started at the research laboratory, where the participants arrived in the morning
in fasted state before going to work. At baseline, six and twelve months, body composition and
blood pressure were measured first followed by blood sampling, whereas at three and nine
months only blood sampling was performed. The protocol continued with the attachment of
the accelerometer and breakfast, where instructions for wearing the accelerometer for seven
days and for filling in questionnaires were given. At baseline a short activity test battery was
performed for purposes of EMG measurement and has been reported elsewhere [17]. After the
laboratory measurements the participants left for work and were expected to wear the acceler-
ometer and to fill in an activity diary. After the measurement period the accelerometer and the
activity diary were to be returned to the research laboratory or to a box located at the kinder-
garten where the initial recruitment was performed.
Primary outcomes.
Primary outcomes of sedentary, light and moderate-to-vigorous
activity time and breaks/sedentary hour were assessed with a waist-worn two-dimensional
accelerometer (dynamic range ± 2.7g, sample rate 75 / s, resolution 8 bit, bandwidth 0–20 Hz,
manufacturer Alive Technologies Ltd., Australia) at baseline and 3, 6, 9 and 12 months thereaf-
ter. This light-weight device was worn in a firm elastic band on the anterior right side of the
waistline for 7 days at each measurement point. During this period the participants kept a log
sheet of their working times, bed times and any abnormal behaviors which could possibly
affect the measurements. These included e.g. bathing, water-based activities or contact-sports,
during which the device was detached. The device was also removed at night. Based on the
diary, data were analyzed for total wear time, work time and weekday and weekend day leisure
time excluding non-wear time. A wear time of at least 10 hours was required for valid week
and weekend days [24,25]. Requirements for a valid total week were a minimum of two days
measurement including at least one weekday resulting in a minimum reliability of 0.68 (S1
Supporting information). Work and leisure time were identified based on diaries, and two
valid measurement days were required for both. To improve comparability and to minimize
the variation in wear time, the outcomes were normalized to 16 hours waking time (total and
weekends) or 8 hours (work and leisure time) [13]. To enable use of validated count thresh-
olds, which are specific to a given monitor model, we performed calibration measurements. A
device-specific factor used in the analysis was derived from simultaneous recordings with the
Alive monitor and ActiGraph GT3X monitor (Actigraph LCC, Pensacola, FL, USA) in a cus-
tom-made calibration machine (University of Jyva
¨skyla
¨) and in two adults during normal
daily life conditions. Time spent in sedentary (< 100 counts/min [24]), light (� 100 < 2020
counts/min) and moderate-to-vigorous activity (� 2020 counts/min [25]) were analyzed in
one minute epochs. A break in sedentary time was defined as an interruption in sedentary

 time when accelerometer counts rose up to or above 100 counts/min for a minimum of one-
minute. The number of breaks was then normalized to sedentary time (h) yielding breaks/sed-
entary hour.
Secondary outcomes.
The secondary outcomes included cardio-metabolic health mark-
ers, energy intake and diet composition. The measurement of cardio-metabolic health markers
was done at the research laboratory of the University of Jyva
¨skyla
¨. Before arriving to the labo-
ratory in the morning participants were asked to fast for a minimum of 10 hours and refrain
from vigorous exercise the day before. Subjects’ height and weight were measured with stan-
dard procedures. Blood pressure was measured twice from the left arm in supine position after
a five minute rest (Omron M6W, Omron Healthcare Co., Ltd. Kyoto, Japan). Body composi-
tion was measured with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA, LUNAR Prodigy, GE
Healthcare). Professional laboratory personnel measured and analyzed total lipids, glucose
and insulin with standardized procedures (Konelab 20 XTi analyzer, Thermo-Fisher, Espoo,
Finland). Homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) was used to calculate hepatic insulin resis-
tance (HOMA-IR) and basal insulin secretion (HOMA-%B) from fasting glucose and insulin
[26]. Additionally, all serum samples were analyzed using a high- throughput serum NMR
metabolomics platform [27] for apolipoproteins and mean diameter of lipoproteins.
Energy intake and diet composition were assessed from dietary records in which the partic-
ipants were asked to report all foods and the quantities consumed. The records were kept on
three weekdays and on one weekend day at the baseline and end of the study, and on one
weekday at 3, 6 and 9 months of the study. Nutri Flow software (Nutri Flow Oy, Oulu, Finland)
was used to analyze intakes of total energy and energy-yielding nutrients as a percentage of
total energy intake.
Sample size
The a priori planned sample size has been reported previously [28]. However, we recalculated
the sample size based on the initial efficacy study of this intervention [17]. A minimum differ-
ence of interest (MDI) was 30 minutes of total sedentary time, which was expected to induce
significant cardio-metabolic and anthropometric benefits [11,17]. Based on the efficacy study,
a sample size of 36 in each group was required to achieve �80% power at 5% two-tailed signifi-
cance to detect decreased total muscle inactivity time. The sample sizes required to achieve a
similar power for work and leisure time were 25 and 55 for each group, respectively. These
sample sizes provided similar power for muscle light activity time and number of bursts.
Assuming a small cluster effect (1.05) and 10% attrition, 64 participants per group was the tar-
get sample size.
Statistical analyses
Intervention effectiveness was tested with linear mixed-effects model fit by REML in statistical
programming language R (R 3.0.1, NLME package, the R foundation for Statistical Comput-
ing). The analysis was based on a three level hierarchy, where the random grouping variables
participants (n = 133) were nested within families (n = 89), and families were nested within
the clusters (n = 7). Likelihood ratios were used to test the effectiveness from baseline to every
measurement time point separately (3 months: from baseline to 3 months; 6 months: from
baseline to 3 and 6 months; etc. up to 12 months). Intention-to-treat principle was used mean-
ing that all participants with acceptable baseline data, including those who dropped out later
or had missing data, were retained in the analysis. Missing data and attrition were assumed to
occur at random and background characteristics between completers and those lost to follow-
up were compared with Chi-square and Mann-Whitney U test and are reported. Estimated

 marginal means are presented for an unadjusted model. P-values are presented for the unad-
justed model and a model adjusted for baseline values of the dependent variable, measurement
duration (in case of accelerometer-derived variables), starting season (spring/summer/
autumn/winter), worktime/day, number of children, single parent (yes/no), age and sex
(adjusted P-value). The models testing the effects on health outcomes were additionally
adjusted for MVPA and energy intake. Log-transformation was used where required but non-
transformed estimated marginal means are presented. As part of the intervention evaluation,
three-way interaction terms were used to study the influence of gender (Group x Time x Gen-
der), single/two participating parents (Group x Time x No of participating parents) and season
at baseline (Group x Time x Season) on intervention effectiveness.
Results
Participants
A total of 300 individuals (150 from intervention and 150 from control regions) expressed an
interest in the study by returning the recruitment form and were assessed for eligibility (Fig 1).
From these, 71 participants from the intervention (47%) and 62 from the control (41%)
regions (9.5 ± 3.4 participants per region) met the inclusion criteria and were assessed at base-
line. Of the InPACT study participants, 71% had university-level education, compared to a
mean of 35% across the recruitment regions. The participants were young adults (age range
28–53 years) of whom almost half were working as managerial employees (Table 1). Based on
objective measurements, about 62% of the whole day, 80% of work time, 47% of leisure time
and 58% of weekends were spent in sedentary behaviors (Table 1). The secondary outcomes at
baseline are presented in S1 Table.
Between the baseline and 12-month follow-up, seven participants dropped out from the
control group (11%) and nine from the intervention group (13%), two of whom (3%) with-
drew before the intervention (Fig 1). Between those who adhered to the study and those who
dropped out, there were no differences at baseline in the number of families where two vs one
parent participated (28.2% / 18.8%), gender (women 56% / 62%), age (37.9 ± 5.4 y / 38.7 ± 5.6
y), worktime/week (37.2 ± 5.6 h / 35.8 ± 6.0 h), professional status distribution (data not
shown), BMI (24.4±3.6 kg/m2 / 25.1±5.0 kg/m2) or accelerometer-assessed sedentary time
(538.1 ± 80.5 min per 16h / 507.6 ± 81.8 min per 16h) and MVPA (34.7 ± 19.2 min per 16h /
35.4 ± 17.8 min per 16h). The number of participants with valid accelerometer data in each
domain, number of days and measurement time per day are reported in Table 1. No significant
group x time–interactions were observed. Valid accelerometer data were available from 547
(90%) whole day measurements throughout the year while 42 (7%) were missing due to drop-
outs and 16 (3%) due to improper measurement. Similarly, valid data were obtained from
85%, 90% and 69% of the worktime, weekday leisure time and weekend day measurements,
respectively, with reasons for data exclusion including improperly filled diaries making
domain separation impossible, problems with measurement, or drop-out.
Effectiveness of the intervention
Effectiveness of the intervention on the primary outcomes is presented as absolute values in
Fig 2 and as estimated marginal means of change from baseline in Table 2. During work time a
group x time interaction was observed for moderate-to-vigorous activity at three (P = 0.011)
and six months (P = 0.015). The change at three months was still evident after the full adjust-
ments. Work moderate-to-vigorous activity changed between groups by 2.8 minutes / 8 hours
at three months (P = 0.034) and by 1.1 minutes / 8 hours at six months (P = 0.014), both driven
by decreases within the control group.

 During leisure time, group x time interactions were significant for sedentary time at three
(P < 0.001), six (P = 0.022), nine (P = 0.014) and 12 months (P = 0.029), for light activity time
(P = 0.008) and breaks/sedentary hour at three months (P = 0.010) and for moderate-to-vigor-
ous activity at six months (P = 0.039). All changes at three months were still evident after the

 full adjustment. At three months, sedentary leisure time decreased 21.2 minutes / 8 hours
more in the intervention group than the control group (P = 0.010). At the same time, leisure
moderate-to-vigorous activity increased 8.0 minutes more in the intervention group than in
controls (P = 0.037) due a decrease within the control group (P = 0.017). No changes at other
times or in other domains were observed (Table 2 and Fig 2).
Secondary outcomes
Intervention effectiveness on energy intake and diet composition (S2 Table), anthropometrics
and blood pressure (S3 Table) and blood-drawn cardio-metabolic biomarkers (S4 Table) are
presented in Supplementary Tables. No group x time effects on energy intake or diet composi-
tion were observed. Fasting plasma glucose changed significantly at three months (P = 0.021),
and HOMA-%B changed significantly at three (P = 0.042) and six months (P = 0.046) in the

 intervention compared to the control group. Only HOMA-%B remained independent of full
adjustment, including moderate-to-vigorous activity and energy intake. The change in fasting
plasma glucose was different between groups at three (-0.18, 95% CI -0.35 to 0.00 mM, P =
0.049) and nine months (-0.22, 95% CI -0.4 to -0.03 mM, P = 0.020), driven by larger decreases
within the intervention group than the control group. Insignificant group effects were
observed for HOMA-%B at all time points.
At 12 months, the group x time effects were significant for the ratio of apoB to apoA-1
(P = 0.039) and for leg lean mass (P = 0.021). Only the change in ratio of apoB to apoA-1
remained independent of full adjustment. Leg lean mass changed between groups at 12
months (0.48, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.77%, P = 0.002), where a decrease within the control group was
observed (P < 0.001, S3 Table). The ratio of apoB to apoA-1 changed between groups at 12
months (-0.04, 95% CI -0.07 to -0.01, P = 0.002), driven by a decrease within the intervention
group (P = 0.033) and an increase within the control group (P = 0.027, S4 Table). After adjust-
ment, the group x time changes in HDL cholesterol became significant at three, nine and 12
months, and in total cholesterol at 12 months, but there were no changes between the groups
at any time points. No changes in other biomarkers were observed.
Intervention evaluation
The lecture and tailored counseling session were attended by 69 parents (97% of those mea-
sured at baseline). Parents set an average of 3.3 ± 2.1 goals for work time (83% set a goal),
2.3 ± 1.6 goals for leisure time (96% set a goal) and 1.9 ± 1.8 goals for weekends (68% set a
goal). The most commonly mentioned topic regarding work time goals was related to breaking
up prolonged sitting periods, e.g. to stand up from a chair every half an hour (mentioned by
53% of responders). During leisure time the most commonly mentioned topic was related to
increasing light intensity physical activity during commuting, e.g. by leaving the car further
away and walking to work (mentioned by 48% of responders). During weekends, going outside
to increase light intensity activity instead of sitting inside was the most common topic (men-
tioned by 81% of responders). At 2 and 5 months, 64 (90%) and 51 (72%) parents were reached
for phone discussion, respectively.
Gender affected the intervention effectiveness in total breaks/sedentary hour (P = 0.013)
and in work light activity time (P = 0.037). Total breaks/sedentary hour changed in the inter-
vention group compared to the control group by 2.8 (95% CI -4.6 to -1.0, P = 0.002) and 2.1
(-3.9 to -0.3, P = 0.024) less in males than females at 3 and 12 months, respectively. Work light
activity time changed in the intervention group compared to the control group 58.7 min/8h
(-100.1 to -17.3, P = 0.006) less in males than females at 3 months.
Intervention effectiveness differed between single vs. two participating parents in total
(P = 0.037) and leisure (P = 0.004) moderate-to-vigorous activity time. Total moderate-to-vig-
orous activity time changed in the intervention group compared to the control group 5.4 min/

ness was observed.
Discussion
Despite the fact that several observational studies have identified sedentary behavior as a prev-
alent and independent cardio-metabolic risk factor, evidence regarding the potential to modify
primarily sedentary behavior in different domains of daily life is limited to short-term

 interventions [14]. This one year cluster randomized controlled trial was designed to decrease
sedentary time and increase light activity time at work and during leisure time in parents with
a sedentary occupation and young children. The lecture, tailored counseling and two follow-
up calls during the first six months induced a small beneficial intervention effect on weekday
sedentary leisure time throughout the whole year. At the same time, some small positive
changes in biomarkers were observed, supporting a potential causal effect of reduced sedentary
leisure time on improved metabolic profile. This cluster randomized controlled trial is one
of the first to target sedentary behaviors in ecologically valid settings across several domains,
and suggests that both behavioral and physiological benefits of reduced sedentary time are
domain-specific.
The present results emphasize the incidental and highly domain-specific nature of habitual
sedentary time. In contrast to the hypothesis, the initial decrease in total sedentary time [17]
was not maintained throughout the year, and the effects were seen only in leisure time. More-
over, investigation of the timeline trend suggests that the intervention participants were able to
reduce leisure sedentary time in the first months of the study, followed by a modest increase
towards midline, and then maintained this level until the end of the study. The trend in the
control group participants was almost the opposite at the beginning, accompanied by a modest
increasing trend in sedentary leisure time towards the end of the study, resulting in a beneficial
intervention effect. Even though a recent meta-analysis reported that studies targeting specifi-
cally sedentary time induced a 48 minute decrease in daily sedentary time, none of them stud-
ied whether this short-term effect could be maintained [14]. The results of this 12 month study
suggest that although the initial efficacy study showed a positive acute effect [17], intervention
methods that are successful in the short term do not necessarily induce long-term positive
effects in total sedentary time, while long-term benefits may be domain-specific.
Sitting is a predominant activity in multiple domains of daily life and interventions target-
ing reduced sedentary time in these domains should be highly context-specific. Although the
present intervention was designed to change both work time and leisure time behaviors, the
only changes were seen in sedentary leisure time, for many possible reasons. Generally, the
effect size of a given intervention is bigger when multiple domains and contexts are modified
and when social, cultural and environmental aspects are considered [29]. A typical example is
a workplace intervention, in which changes in physical environment and targeting the whole
workplace community [30], instead of intervening merely at an individual level [31], have
been found to be beneficial. The focus on families rather than the workplace community
clearly favored leisure time changes, emphasizing the context-specificity of this approach. A
recent review identified restructuring of the social or physical environment among the most
promising behavior change techniques to reduce sedentary time [32]. In addition, their analy-
sis distinguished different functions across worksite and non-worksite settings, with the idea
that worksite sedentary behavior may be more predictable than non-worksite sedentary time
[32], which may explain the lack of effectiveness concerning work time in the present study.
Even though targeting increased motivation through information provision has been sug-
gested for the pursuit of significant population-level decreases in sedentary behavior [32], the
information provision along with the other intervention techniques used in this study affected
only leisure time behaviors. However, the present intervention was more effective at increasing
women’s work light activity time, whereas a recent meta-analysis reported a more effective
reduction in total sedentary time in men [14]. The possible domain- and intervention tech-
nique–specific gender effects require further study. Positive group-level long-term changes at
work might be achievable by environmental restructuring, which would maximize opportuni-
ties for light intensity physical activity alongside work routines, and make the active choice
more socially acceptable and even appealing. Even though workplace interventions are

 considered to be important because the majority of total sitting hours are accumulated at work
[33], the present results showed that changes were more effective during leisure time where
the sitting time was already lower, and highlight the possibility that leisure sedentary time can
be decreased without changes in total or work sedentary time.
In short-term experimental laboratory studies, reallocation of sitting to light intensity activ-
ity has been shown to be beneficial for glucose metabolism [34,35], which is in line with the
observed decrease in fasting plasma glucose at three months in this study. The proposed acute
mechanisms include improved muscle-activity -mediated glucose transport, decreased post-
prandial glycemic load and improved plasma triglyceride catabolism among others [34,36,37].
Interestingly, these proposed acute benefits of reducing sedentary time were not reflected dur-
ing the 12 month follow-up, but beneficial changes in leg lean mass and apoB/apoA-1 ratio
were seen. ApoA-1 accounts for the majority of protein in HDL particles and is responsible for
the gathering of excess cholesterol into HDL particles from peripheral cells. It also induces
anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, with apoB inducing atherogenic mechanisms in
LDL subclasses. As such, the apoB/apoA-1 -ratio appears to be a better marker for cardiovas-
cular diseases than traditional lipids or lipid ratios [38]. In a study by Duvivier et al. (2013),
light intensity physical activity that reduced total sitting time reduced triglycerides and insulin
response, but also apoB concentrations [9]. Even though the apoB/apoA-1 -ratio was not
reported, their short term result supports our notion that long-term changes in sedentary time
may also influence apolipoproteins. Moreover, just two weeks of reduced daily ambulatory
activities results in a decline in leg lean mass due to decreased muscle protein synthesis without
changes in upper body lean mass, providing some support for the observation of this study
[39,40]. Although the changes were small, these novel findings support distinct acute vs. long
term benefits of reduced leisure sedentary time even in a group of healthy, normal weight and
relatively young individuals.
An unexpected finding was that the cardio-metabolic benefits were evident during the one-
year follow-up despite the fact that the intervention did not decrease total sedentary time, and
that the decrease in sedentary leisure time plateaued towards the end of the study. Based on
epidemiological evidence, the health risks of sedentary leisure time are more pronounced than
those of work time, suggesting that a domain-specific decrease in sedentary time can be effec-
tive even without decreases in total sedentary time [15,16]. Indeed, the participants were able
to decrease leisure sedentary time at the beginning of the study with a sufficient magnitude to
produce some cardio-metabolic benefits [34,35]. Even though the decrease in sedentary time
plateaued towards the end of the study, beneficial changes in leg lean mass and anthropo-
metrics were evident only at the 12 month time point. Group-specific examination revealed
that the beneficial intervention effect on leg lean mass was due to an adverse change within
the control group, suggesting that their high sedentary time throughout the year and an
increasing trend in sedentary leisure time at the end of the study were hazardous, but even a
small decrease in the intervention group’s leisure sedentary time was enough to prevent a
decrease in leg lean mass. A similar trend towards a group effect was observable in body mass,
BMI and arm and leg fat mass, but the group x time effects were insignificant. These findings
should be considered as preliminary since this study was not powered for secondary health
outcomes. Moreover, although there were no group x time effects in any diet variables, some
within-group changes in energy intake may have contributed to the observed results. Some of
the key cardio-metabolic effects of sedentary time may be linked to interactions between sed-
entary periods and energy intake, and should be carefully assessed in future interventions [41].
Bearing in mind the aforementioned uncertainties, the present data points to a possibility
that some health benefits of reducing sedentary time may be attributable to the prevention of
adverse health effects of high sedentary time. This idea is supported by experimental findings

 of rapid deleterious effects of increased sedentary time on insulin sensitivity, maximal oxygen
consumption and leg lean mass, which are easy to prevent with habitual levels of physical activ-
ity [40]. In addition, compositional data-analyses have shown that an increase in sedentary
time is more deleteriously associated with cardio-metabolic health markers than the benefits
gained by a decrease in sedentary time of similar magnitude [42]. Future interventions should
consider whether simply maintaining the current level of sedentary behavior, which prevents
an increase in sedentary time, could be an achievable, feasible and ultimately effective goal at
the population level and within the lifespan of an individual, which both show an increasing
trend in sedentary time [2,24].
Although widely utilized, a clear drawback of this study was the use of waist-worn acceler-
ometers to assess the primary outcomes. The primary results illustrate changes between non-
movement and movement, but provide no information about postures like standing, although
standing increases muscle activity and is beneficial for health [10,43]. Another limitation was
that the a-priori planned sample size was not reached [18]. However, the significant findings
in some of the primary outcomes suggest that the sample was big enough to test the primary
hypothesis. The outcomes were assessed objectively with accelerometers at several time points,
which is a strength of this study. Moreover, separation of different domains in intervention
message and analysis, assessment of energy intake, long follow-up, robust statistical methods
and a no-treatment control group enabled assessment of domain-specific behavioral and phys-
iological effectiveness of the intervention, which is relevant for the field. Taken together, the
present results provide a conservative estimate of the long-term domain-specific effectiveness
of an intervention targeting sedentary-time, which could be improved by assessing posture
and including high-risk participant groups.
Conclusions
This cluster randomized controlled trial targeting reduced sedentary time in parents with
a sedentary occupation and young children had a beneficial effect on weekday sedentary lei-
sure time in the intervention group compared to controls without affecting total, weekend or
work sedentary time. The behavioral method induced a small decrease in weekday sedentary
leisure time throughout the year, and although the magnitude of decrease plateaued towards
the end of the study, beneficial effects on apoB/apoA-1 balance and leg muscle mass were
observed. In the long term, a change in only sedentary leisure time might induce small health
benefits, and can be achieved by behavioral counseling targeting parents with a sedentary
occupation and young children. Given the evident challenges in promoting moderate-to-vig-
orous physical activity, reducing sedentary leisure time may be a feasible alternative to reap
health benefits.
