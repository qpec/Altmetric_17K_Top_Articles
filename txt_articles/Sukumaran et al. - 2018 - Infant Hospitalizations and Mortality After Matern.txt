BACKGROUND: The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices currently recommends 
pregnant women receive influenza and tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and 
acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccines. There are limited studies of the long-term safety in 
infants for vaccines administered during pregnancy. We evaluate whether maternal receipt 
of influenza and Tdap vaccines increases the risk of infant hospitalization or death in the 
first 6 months of life.
METHODS: We included singleton, live birth pregnancies in the Vaccine Safety Datalink 
between 2004 and 2014. Outcomes were infant hospitalizations and mortality in the first 6 
months of life. We performed a case-control study matching case patients and controls 1:1 
and used conditional logistic regression to estimate odds ratios for maternal exposure to 
influenza and/or Tdap vaccines in pregnancy.
RESULTS: There were 413 034 live births in our population. Of these, 25 222 infants had 
hospitalizations and 157 infants died in the first 6 months of life. We found no association 
between infant hospitalization and maternal influenza (adjusted odds ratio: 1.00; 95% 
confidence interval [CI]: 0.96–1.04) or Tdap (adjusted odds ratio: 0.94; 95% CI: 0.88–1.01) 
vaccinations. We found no association between infant mortality and maternal influenza 
(adjusted odds ratio: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.54–1.69) or Tdap (adjusted odds ratio: 0.44; 95% CI: 
0.17–1.13) vaccinations.
CONCLUSIONS: We found no association between vaccination during pregnancy and risk of 
infant hospitalization or death in the first 6 months of life. These findings support the 
safety of current recommendations for influenza and Tdap vaccination during pregnancy.

What’s KnoWn on this subject: Influenza and 
tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and 
acellular pertussis vaccines are recommended in 
pregnancy. Although there is evidence that these 
vaccines are safe in pregnant women, there are 
limited long-term data on infants born to mothers 
vaccinated during pregnancy.
What this study adds: Influenza and tetanus 
toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular 
pertussis vaccines in pregnancy are not associated 
with an increased risk of hospitalization or death 
in infants. Our findings contribute to the knowledge 
of the long-term safety of vaccination during 
pregnancy.

 The Advisory Committee on 
Immunization Practices currently 
recommends 2 vaccines to be given 
during each pregnancy; influenza 
vaccine has been recommended at 
any time during pregnancy since 
2004 to prevent maternal influenza 
disease and complications1 and 
tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria 
toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) 
vaccine has been recommended 
during each pregnancy since 2012, 
with a preference for administration 
between 27 and 36 weeks’ gestation, 
to protect infants from pertussis 
disease.2 Given the relative proximity 
of an immunization administered 
during pregnancy to a potential 
infant hospitalization or death, an 
observed temporal association with 
maternal influenza or Tdap vaccine 
during pregnancy and infant death or 
hospitalization may raise concerns 
about a possible causal relationship.
Both pertussis and influenza 
infections are associated with 
hospitalizations and fatalities in 
infants, and severity is highest 
before infants are eligible for the 
respective vaccines. Approximately 
half of infants <4 months of age with 
pertussis require hospitalization, and 
the majority of deaths from pertussis 
occur in these infants.3 In 2014, the 
US pertussis case rate in infants <6 
months of age was 169 per 100 000 
infants.4 Furthermore, there were 
8 deaths in infants <3 months of 
age and 1 death in infants 3 to 11 
months of age out of 13 total deaths 
from pertussis in all age groups in 
2014. Similarly, infants are at high 
risk of hospitalization and death 
from influenza. The US influenza 
hospitalization rate ranges from 
1.8 to 7.2 per 1000 in infants <6 
months of age.5 For the 2013–2014 
influenza season, there were 96 
laboratory-confirmed, influenza-
associated pediatric deaths, 18 of 
which occurred in children aged <6 
months.6 Maternal immunization 
with influenza and Tdap vaccines 
allows for passive antibody transfer 
and protection to infants for the 
respective diseases when they are 
most vulnerable.1, 
 
2,

In 2015, the infant (≤12 months) 
mortality rate in the United 
States was 589.5 per 100 000 live 
births, 
8 and the leading causes of 
infant deaths were (1) congenital 
malformations, deformations, and 
chromosomal abnormalities; (2) 
disorders related to low birth weight 
and short gestation; and (3) sudden 
infant death syndrome. In 2010, the 
leading causes of hospitalizations 
in infants ≤12 months were (1) 
acute bronchitis (238 per 10 000 
population), (2) jaundice (104 
per 10 000 population), and 
(3) pneumonia (56 per 10 000 
population).9 Although there have 
been reassuring safety data for 
influenza and Tdap vaccines in which 
maternal acute events, pregnancy 
complications, and birth outcomes 
were evaluated, 
10 
– 
19 there have 
been limited safety studies beyond 
the immediate neonatal period.20 
– 
24 
Vaccine safety continues to be a 
primary reason why providers and 
patients choose not to vaccinate 
during pregnancy.25 
–27 Although the 
biologic plausibility is unclear for the 
association of maternal vaccination 
and infant hospitalization or death, 
there may be concerns of long-term 
effects on infants after any pregnancy 
exposure. In this study, we evaluate 
whether maternal receipt of influenza 
and Tdap vaccines increases the 
risk of hospitalization or death in US 
infants in the first 6 months of life.
Methods
study Population
The Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) 
is a collaboration between the 
Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention and 8 integrated health 
care systems (sites) and includes 
vaccination and health care data on 
∼10 million persons per year.28 In 
addition, the VSD includes data on 
∼125 000 pregnant women annually. 
We used data on pregnant women 
from 5 VSD sites with available data 
that comprise over 90% of the VSD 
population: Kaiser Permanente 
Northern California (Oakland, 
CA), Kaiser Permanente Southern 
California (Pasadena, CA), Kaiser 
Permanente Colorado (Denver, 
CO), Marshfield Clinic Research 
Foundation (Marshfield, WI), and 
Kaiser Permanente Northwest 
(Portland, OR).
We used the validated VSD 
Pregnancy Episode Algorithm to 
identify pregnant women.29 The 
Pregnancy Episode Algorithm uses 
comprehensive electronic medical 
record and administrative databases 
(including diagnosis and procedure 
codes, laboratory tests, pharmacy 
records, and imaging procedures) 
to identify pregnancies, pregnancy 
outcomes, and pregnancy start 
and end dates, and it is able to link 
pregnant women to their infants. 
We included women from the VSD 
with pregnancies ending in a live 
birth between January 1, 2004, 
and June 30, 2014. We required 
pregnant women to be enrolled at 
a VSD site for the duration of the 
pregnancy episode and to have at 
least 1 prenatal care visit. To increase 
completeness of data, infants of these 
pregnant women were required to 
have a birth record and to have VSD 
site enrollment until 6 months of 
life or until the time of death. We 
excluded pregnancies in which a live 
vaccine was administered because 
live vaccines are contraindicated in 
pregnancy. We also excluded infants 
of multiple gestation pregnancies, 
infants born before 34 weeks’ 
gestation, and infants with major 
birth defects because these infants 
are at a higher risk of hospitalization 
and death. Furthermore, we excluded 
all infants who died during their 
delivery hospitalization because 
cause of death in these infants is 
often a perinatal complication (such 
as placental abruption) that would 
likely be unrelated to maternal

 vaccination. Additionally, infants who 
die during the birth hospitalization 
may be less likely to be enrolled in 
the VSD and captured in our data. We 
also excluded infants with external 
causes of death (International 
Classification of Diseases, 10th 
Revision [ICD-10] codes S00-T98 
and V00-Y98) and infants with 
external causes of hospitalizations 
(International Classification of 
Diseases, Ninth Revision [ICD-9] 
codes 800-999, E800-E999) due 
to injury and poisonings because 
these are unlikely to result from a 
maternal vaccination. ICD-10 coding 
was not available for hospitalization 
diagnoses in the United States during 
the time of this study.
case-control Matching
Among infants meeting inclusion 
criteria, those infants with 
hospitalizations or deaths within 
the first 6 months of life were 
included in this analysis. Respiratory 
hospitalization case patients were 
a subset of hospitalization case 
patients defined by any respiratory 
ICD-9 code (033, 460–488, 
491–496, 510–519) associated 
with a hospitalization in the 
first 6 months of life. For infants 
with >1 hospitalization, the first 
hospitalization was selected for 
each category (ie, first all-cause 
hospitalization, first respiratory 
hospitalization). Furthermore, an 
infant could be included as a death 
case patient and hospitalization case 
patient if the infant was hospitalized 
and later died. In the VSD, deaths are 
identified from state death records, 
electronic medical records, and 
administrative sources, and there is 
approximately a 1-year lag from the 
time of death to the availability of 
state death records. Because of lag 
time in the death data, we evaluated 
deaths occurring from January 1, 
2004, to December 31, 2013, and 
hospitalizations from January 1, 
2004, to December 31, 2014. Matched 
controls for the infant mortality 
analysis were selected among 
infants in the study who survived 
the first 6 months of life. Matched 
controls for the infant hospitalization 
and respiratory hospitalization 
analyses were selected from infants 
without death or hospitalization in 
the first 6 months of life. All infant 
controls were required to have at 
least 1 diphtheria-tetanus-acellular 
pertussis (DTaP) vaccine recorded 
between 6 weeks and 6 months of 
age to ensure infants were accessing 
the health care system. We matched 
case patients and controls 1:1 using 
optimal matching.30 Case patients 
and controls were matched on 
the basis of VSD site, birth month 
and year (within 1 month), and 
gestational age groups of late 
preterm (34–36 weeks), term (37–41 
weeks), and postterm (42–44 weeks). 
With our optimal matching, we 
successfully found controls for 100% 
of our case patients by using these 
parameters.
Vaccinations
The exposure of interest was 
maternal vaccination with any 
influenza and/or Tdap vaccines 
during pregnancy. A vaccine during 
pregnancy was defined as one given 
from 7 days after the pregnancy start 
date to 7 days before the pregnancy 
end date. These time windows were 
chosen to avoid including exposures 
to vaccinations given before or 
immediately after pregnancy. We 
stratified vaccine exposures as any 
influenza vaccine (with or without 
Tdap), any Tdap vaccine (with 
or without influenza), and both 
influenza and Tdap vaccines in the 
same pregnancy. In our evaluation 
of maternal influenza vaccine, we 
also repeated our analysis limiting 
outcomes to events occurring during 
the influenza season (October 
through May), to ascertain any 
protective findings that may be more 
evident when influenza virus is 
circulating. We also did a sensitivity 
analysis stratifying our exposure 
by influenza vaccine only and Tdap 
vaccine only to see if our results 
would differ by limiting our exposure 
groups.
statistical analysis
We measured rates of influenza and 
Tdap maternal vaccination in our 
study cohort from 2004 to 2013. We 
also measured trends of infant deaths 
and hospitalizations during this same 
time period to look for any ecological 
associations between maternal 
vaccination and our infant outcomes. 
For our main analysis, we performed 
a conditional logistic regression 
analysis to estimate the odds of 
maternal vaccination in matched 
case patients and controls. In our 
analysis, we determined a priori 
to include the following potential 
confounders from electronic VSD 
data sources28: Kotelchuck Adequacy 
of Prenatal Care Index, 
31 race and 
ethnicity (non-Hispanic African 
American or American Indian versus 
other races and ethnicities), maternal 
age, pregnancy complications and 
maternal comorbidities (hemorrhage, 
hypertensive disorders, renal 
disease, diabetes, thyroid disease, 
cardiovascular disease, epilepsy), 
smoking during pregnancy (yes, no, 
or unknown), infant DTaP exposure 
before outcome (or index date in 
matched controls), duration of 
birth hospitalization in days, and 
gestational age at delivery in weeks.
We also reviewed medical records 
of infants with respiratory related 
deaths (ICD-10 codes: A37, J00–J99). 
We reviewed clinical information 
relating to a potential influenza- or 
pertussis-related cause of death 
and laboratory data in the 2-week 
period preceding death. For influenza 
laboratory data, we looked for 
positive influenza A or B rapid 
antigen, polymerase chain reaction 
(PCR), viral culture, and direct 
fluorescent antibody test results in 
all respiratory death case patients. 
For pertussis, we looked for positive 
Bordetella pertussis PCR and culture

Downloaded from 
 test results for any death case patient 
with the ICD-10 code A37 (whooping 
cough).
We determined a priori that with an 
expected average exposure rate of 
15% for both vaccines throughout 
the study period, 
32 
– 
34 we would need 
at least 840 case patients to have 
80% power to detect an odds ratio of 
1.5. The protocol for this study was 
approved by the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention Institutional 
Review Board and institutional 
review boards at each of the 
participating VSD sites. All analyses 
were conducted by using SAS version 
9.3 (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC).
Results
During our study period, we 
identified 500 447 pregnancies 
ending in a live birth that met 
enrollment criteria. We excluded 
87 413 (17.5%) because of 
maternal or infant factors (Fig 1). 
Of the remaining 413 034 infants, 
25 222 infants had 1 or more 
hospitalizations and 157 infants died. 
Of the hospitalized infants, 4644 
(18.4%) had a respiratory cause for 
their hospitalization; 105 (2.2%) 
of these infants had an influenza 
ICD-9 code (487, 488), and 137 (3%) 
had a pertussis ICD-9 code (033.0, 
033.9). Of the deaths, 14 (9%) had a 
respiratory cause of death; however, 
none of these deaths were considered 
to have been caused by influenza or 
pertussis infections on the basis of 
our laboratory and medical record 
review. Of the 157 infants that died, 
the age at death ranged from 1 to 
180 days with a mean of 61 days 
and a median of 51 days. The most 
common causes of death were 
unknown causes (32%), sudden 
infant death syndrome (21%), and 
certain conditions originating in the 
perinatal period (17%).
We analyzed overall trends 
of influenza and/or pertussis 
vaccination in pregnancy and 
trends of infant hospitalization 
and mortality in our study 
population from 2004 to 2013 
(Fig 2). From 2004, there was an 
increase in maternal influenza 
vaccination, which became more 
dramatic in 2009 after the H1N1 
influenza pandemic. Maternal Tdap 
vaccination increased starting in 
2010 when California recommended 
pregnant women to receive Tdap in 
pregnancy in response to the 2010 
statewide pertussis epidemic.35 
There was another increase in 
Tdap vaccination in 2012 after the 
most recent Advisory Committee 
on Immunization Practices 
recommendation to administer Tdap 
vaccination in every pregnancy.2 
We observed no increase in the 
infant hospitalization rate or infant 
mortality rate during the same time 
period.
We matched case patients with 
eligible controls and compared 
characteristics between these 
groups (Table 1, Supplemental Table 
3). Infants who were hospitalized 
were more likely to have mothers 
with pregnancy complications, less 
likely to be delivered by cesarean 
delivery, and less likely to be of 
African American non-Hispanic or 
American Indian race. Mean maternal 
age, gestational age at delivery, and 
length of birth hospitalization were 
statistically significantly different 
between the groups but not clinically 
different. Infants who died were 
similar to matched controls.
In our adjusted analysis, we found 
no significant association between 
infant hospitalization or death 
in the first 6 months of life and 
receipt of maternal influenza and/
or Tdap vaccines and no significant 
association between infant 
hospitalization from respiratory 
causes and maternal influenza 
vaccine (Table 2). However, the odds 
of maternal Tdap vaccination was 
significantly lower among infants 
with hospitalizations because of 
respiratory causes (adjusted odds 
ratio: 0.79; 95% confidence interval 
[CI]: 0.67–0.94; P = .007) compared 
with controls without hospitalization. 
Furthermore, when evaluating infant 
hospitalizations and death occurring 
during periods of influenza virus 
circulation (October through May) 
and peak influenza virus circulation 
(November through February), we 
found no association with maternal 
influenza vaccine exposure (data not 
shown). When limiting our exposure 
groups to women receiving influenza 
vaccine without Tdap vaccine and 
Tdap vaccine without influenza 
vaccine, our results were similar to 
our main analysis (Supplemental 
Table 4).
discussion
In our study of maternal influenza 
and Tdap vaccines, we found no 
increased risk of infant all-cause 
hospitalizations, hospitalizations 
from respiratory causes, or all-cause 
mortality in the first 6 months of 
life. Our study helps strengthen 
the growing evidence of long-term 
safety of vaccination in pregnancy for 
infants.
Our findings are similar to other 
studies that have evaluated infant 
mortality and morbidity after 
maternal vaccination in pregnancy, 
most of which have evaluated the 
safety of adjuvanted H1N1 influenza-
containing vaccines. Studies of 
short-term infant mortality in the 
first 7 days of life, 
20 growth and 
development and health care visits 
for infections in the first year of life, 
23 
 
early neonatal or childhood death, 
22  
and childhood hospitalization  
rates, 
21 have not found an increased 
risk of these outcomes in children 
of women who received adjuvanted 
H1N1 influenza–containing vaccines 
in pregnancy. Unlike these previous 
studies, however, our study included 
women who received any type of 
influenza vaccine, none of which 
contain adjuvants in the United 
States, and we found similar results.

 Our findings are also consistent 
with studies in which researchers

studies did not find an increased 
risk of these infant outcomes after 
maternal Tdap vaccination during 
pregnancy. Our study managed a 
larger number of infants and had 
similar findings to these studies, 
further demonstrating long-term 
safety in infants of Tdap vaccine 
exposure in pregnancy.
We did find a protective association 
between maternal Tdap during

pregnancy and infant respiratory 
hospitalizations, which is consistent 
with results of other published 
studies that have looked at infant 
pertussis as an outcome.7, 
 
39 
–42  
However, only 3% of infants 
hospitalized for respiratory causes 
had a pertussis ICD-9 code. This 
could indicate that infants with 
pertussis are not being appropriately 
diagnosed and tested.43 It is also 
possible that other factors (eg, the 
healthy adherer effect44 and other 
differences in people who choose 
vaccination and those who do not) 
are contributing to this finding.
This study does have some 
limitations. The VSD captures 
data on an insured population, 
which could translate to better 
health outcomes than the general 
population. Additionally, VSD has a 
high rate of women with adequate 
prenatal care on the basis of the 
Kotelchuck index, which can translate 
to better infant outcomes.31 A recent 
study has revealed that despite 
being a fully insured population, 
the VSD is comparable to the total 
US population on many important 
demographic factors.45 Moreover, 
the VSD population size is large, and 
even groups that typically comprise 
a smaller proportion of insured 
populations (ie, lower income 
populations) still have a substantial 
(>2 million individuals) presence in 
the VSD. There may have been bias 
related to requiring controls to have 
a DTaP vaccine record to be included 
in the study. We did this to ensure we 
had access to health care utilization 
data to avoid misclassifying case 
patients as controls. To look for 
bias, we repeated our analysis of 
hospitalizations requiring case

similar results to our main findings. 
We looked at broad safety outcomes 
(hospitalizations, respiratory 
hospitalizations, and deaths) and 
may not capture true increases 
in a specific outcome, if such an 
association was present. We relied 
on vaccination data from our VSD 
electronic data files and may not 
have captured vaccines in pregnancy 
occurring outside the health care 
system. However, previous internal 
work looking at influenza vaccination 
in pregnancy revealed that the  
VSD vaccine files are over 98% 
complete in capturing these data  
(J. Donahue, DVM, PhD, unpublished 
observations). We did not evaluate 
the risks of infant hospitalizations 
and mortality in multiple gestation 
infants, very preterm infants, and 
those with major birth defects 
because these infants are at a much 
higher risk of the outcomes we 
studied; therefore, our results are not 
generalizable to these populations. 
Finally, we were sufficiently powered 
for our outcomes of hospitalizations 
and hospitalizations from respiratory 
causes but underpowered for the 
outcome of death.
This is the first study in which infant 
hospitalizations and mortality in the 
first 6 months of life after maternal 
influenza vaccine and Tdap vaccines 
are evaluated. In this large case-
control study, we found no increased 
risk of infant hospitalization and 
death after vaccination in pregnancy. 
Our findings support the safety of 
influenza and pertussis vaccinations 
during pregnancy for infants of 
vaccinated mothers.
