Abstract
Background: The prevalence of fathers’ depression and anxiety in the perinatal period (i.e. from conception to 1
year after birth) is approximately 5–10%, and 5–15%, respectively; their children face increased risk of adverse
emotional and behavioural outcomes, independent of maternal mental health. Critically, fathers can be protective
against the development of maternal perinatal mental health problems and their effects on child outcomes.
Preventing and treating paternal mental health problems and promoting paternal psychological wellbeing may
therefore benefit the family as a whole. This study examined fathers’ views and direct experiences of paternal
perinatal mental health.
Methods: Men in the Born and Bred in Yorkshire (BaBY) epidemiological prospective cohort who met eligibility
criteria (baby born <12 months; completed Mental Health and Wellbeing [MHWB] questionnaires) were invited to
participate. Those expressing interest (n = 42) were purposively sampled to ensure diversity of MHWB scores. In-
depth interviews were conducted at 5–10 months postpartum with 19 men aged 25–44 years. The majority were
first-time fathers and UK born; all lived with their partner. Data were analysed using thematic analysis.
Results: Four themes were identified: ‘legitimacy of paternal stress and entitlement to health professionals’ support’,
‘protecting the partnership’, ‘navigating fatherhood’, and, ‘diversity of men’s support networks’. Men largely
described their ‘stress’ with reference to exhaustion, poor concentration and irritability. Despite feeling excluded by
maternity services, fathers questioned their entitlement to support, noting that services are pressured and ‘should’
be focused on mothers. Men emphasised the need to support their partner and protect their partnership as central
to the successfully navigation of fatherhood; they used existing support networks where available but noted the
paucity of tailored support for fathers.

Conclusions: Fathers experience psychological distress in the perinatal period but question the legitimacy of their
experiences. Men may thus be reluctant to express their support needs or seek help amid concerns that to do so
would detract from their partner’s needs. Resources are needed that are tailored to men, framed around
fatherhood, rather than mental health or mental illness, and align men’s self-care with their role as supporter and
protector. Further research is needed to inform how best to identify and manage both parents’ mental health
needs and promote their psychological wellbeing, in the context of achievable models of service delivery.

Background
Perinatal mental health refers to mental health in the
period spanning pregnancy, childbirth, and the first
postnatal year [1]. In this paper we use perinatal
mental health as an umbrella term that encompasses
mental health problems, psychological distress and
psychological wellbeing, consistent with shifts in men-
tal healthcare from solely treating and preventing
mental health problems, to also promoting psycho-
logical wellbeing [2, 3].
Perinatal mental health problems may be pre-existing
(i.e. continuing or recurring in the perinatal period) or
new onset [4]. Meta-analyses of studies reporting diag-
nosed mental health problems and above-threshold
symptoms indicate that approximately 5–10% of fathers
experience perinatal depression [5] and 5–15% experi-
ence perinatal anxiety [6] – about half the rate recorded
in mothers [7–9]. Paternal perinatal anxiety and depres-
sion can have a profound impact on fathers’ wellbeing,
functioning and relationships [10]. Prospective data indi-
cates that their children also face increased risk of
adverse behavioural and emotional outcomes and, al-
though maternal and paternal mental illness is modestly
correlated, the effects of paternal depression exist after
controlling for maternal depression [11, 12]. The costs
of paternal perinatal mental illness are currently un-
known but likely to be considerable given that the UK’s
immediate and long-term costs of maternal perinatal
anxiety and depression are estimated at £6.6 billion each
year; of which 60% relates to impacts on the child [13].
The positive correlation between paternal and mater-
nal mental health, coupled with early evidence of the
emotional, behavioural, and developmental effects that
paternal perinatal mental illness has on children, has led
to calls for the development of models of service delivery
that focus on the psychological wellbeing of the couple
and family rather than the individual [5], including the
routine assessment or screening of fathers’ mental health
and wellbeing in perinatal services [14–16]. Paternal de-
pressive symptoms increase the risk of continued or
worsening maternal symptoms [17] and fathers’ positive
involvement reduces the risk of adverse behavioural out-
comes in the children of depressed mothers [18, 19].
Treating and preventing paternal perinatal mental ill-
ness and improving paternal psychological wellbeing
therefore not only have benefits for men, but also
offer potential to maximise effective support for the
mother and child from within the family. Despite this,
perinatal services (including mental health services,
maternity services and primary care) are currently de-
signed to assess maternal mental health and well-
being, and to prevent and manage maternal perinatal
mental health problems [20].
In the general population, men are known to manifest
their psychological distress differently from women [21].
Men are also less likely than women to access health ser-
vices relating to their mental health and when they do,
tend to use different language, present with different
symptoms, and have different needs [22]. However, re-
search on the experiences of mental illness and psycho-
logical distress in the perinatal period, how it manifests,
its time course, and the barriers and facilitators to seek-
ing and accessing help, has primarily focused on women.
Little is known about men’s presentation in the perinatal
period and health professionals have described postnatal
depression in men as ‘vague and difficult to detect’ [23].
There is a dearth of information regarding men’s experi-
ences of their own perinatal mental health, and our un-
derstanding of how best to address fathers’ mental
health and psychological wellbeing, including whether
they have distinct challenges, needs and preferences, is
severely limited as a result [24, 25].
Several reviews have synthesised qualitative research
of fathers’ experiences during pregnancy and the transi-
tion to parenthood [26–32], but these have examined
the broader experiences and challenges encountered by
first-time fathers and their experiences of maternity ser-
vices. The majority of studies addressing men’s experi-
ences and views concerning perinatal mental health have
been limited to the experiences of men whose partner
has postnatal depression [33–37]. Studies specifically in-
vestigating fathers’ own experiences of mental health
and wellbeing during the perinatal period are rare.
To the best of our knowledge, to date, only one pub-
lished study [38] has specifically explored the experi-
ences of fathers with depression. Edhborg et al. [38]

 interviewed 19 fathers in Sweden who self-identified as
having depressive symptoms 3 to 6 months postpartum.
Prominent in men’s accounts were deterioration in their
relationships with their partners and difficulties in balan-
cing the competing demands of family, work, and their
own needs. Fathers in the study experienced themselves
as invisible and excluded as parents, and lacked ad-
equate help and support to meet the challenge of new
fatherhood and a changed partner relationship.
In light of the lack of evidence, the aim of this study
was to examine the views and experiences of first-time
and subsequent fathers reporting symptoms across the
continuum of psychological distress, concerning their
perinatal mental health and explore their perceptions of
what makes perinatal mental health resources accessible
and acceptable. This research is important to build the
evidence
base
and
inform
suggestions
for
service
provision.
Methods
Design
An interpretive qualitative study using semi-structured
interviews with first-time or subsequent fathers.
Procedure
The Born and Bred in Yorkshire (BaBY) cohort was used
as a sampling framework. BaBY (www.bornbredyorks.org)
is a population-based prospective cohort of babies and
their parents. Parents were originally recruited to the co-
hort via maternity services at four sites across North
Yorkshire and East Lincolnshire in 2011–2014. Partners
were invited to take part via the mother, irrespective of
their status as the mother’s partner and/or baby’s bio-
logical father. Data collected in the BaBY cohort included:
maternal background and obstetric history; pregnancy and
birth outcomes; and a Mental Health and Wellbeing
[MHWB] questionnaire provided to both parents at ap-
proximately 26–28 weeks of pregnancy, and 8 weeks
following birth. Details of the measures included in the
MHWB questionnaire are presented in Table 1.
The BaBY research team identified men who met the
following eligibility criteria: consented to be contacted
again; baby born in the past 12 months at ≥37 weeks’
gestation; no serious health concern with mother or
baby before discharge; previously completed mental
health and wellbeing [MHWB] questionnaires. Same-sex
parents were excluded due to the focus here being fa-
thers. Most babies were aged over 6 months at the time
of invitation due to recruitment of parents to the cohort
having ceased in 2014.
Eligible fathers were sent a pack containing: a Partici-
pant Information Sheet; a pre-paid envelope; a form to
record interest in taking part, contact details and con-
sent to access existing BaBY data; and a form to record
background characteristics (paternal information was
not collected in the original cohort). Reminder packs
were sent 2 weeks after initial posting. Those expressing
interest were purposively sampled on the basis of their
antenatal and postnatal MHWB scores, using maximum
variation sampling [39] to ensure that fathers with a
range of MHWB scores were included in the study.
Ethics, consent and permissions
Interviews were transcribed with the principle of ano-
nymity in mind. Participants were able to withdraw from
the study, without giving any explanation; none chose to
do so. Exemptions to confidentiality were detailed in the
consent process; specifically risk of harm to self or
others, and instances of possible bad practice by the
NHS. Protocols were in place concerning disclosures in-
dicating risk to self or others.
Sample characteristics
In total, 42 of the 140 eligible men expressed interest in
interview, returning their contact details and valid con-
sent to access existing BaBY data. The MHWB scores

Description
PHQ-8 [46, 47]
The PHQ-9 is a 9-item questionnaire which assesses the core symptoms of depression and their frequency in the past
2 weeks, rated from 0 (“not at all”) to 3 (“nearly every day”); here, the 8-item version was used, excluding the item on
suicidality; cut points of 5, 10, 15 and 20 respectively indicate mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe levels of
depression [46, 47]; cut-off scores between 8 and 11 give acceptable diagnostic properties for detecting major depressive
disorder in the general population [48]
GAD-7 [49]
7-item questionnaire which assesses the core symptoms of anxiety and their frequency in the past 2 weeks, rated from
0 (“not at all”) to 3 (“nearly every day”);cut points of 5, 10 and 15 respectively indicate mild, moderate, and severe levels of
anxiety [49]; cut-off scores between 7 and 10 give acceptable diagnostic properties for identifying generalised
anxiety disorder [50]
PHQ-15 [51]
15-item questionnaire which assesses somatic symptoms (e.g. headaches, dizziness, trouble sleeping) and their
frequency in the past 4 weeks, rated from 0 (“not bothered at all”) to 2 (“bothered a lot”); total scores of 5, 10 and 15
respectively indicate low, medium and high levels of somatic symptom severity

 for men who expressed an interest in taking part in an
interview (n = 42) and those who did not (n = 98) were
comparable across all measures and at both time-points
(see Additional file 1) and considered representative of
fathers in the BaBY cohort. A purposive sample of 22
men with a broad range of MHWB scores were invited
for interview, three of which did not respond to the re-
searchers’ efforts to make contact. The participants’
characteristics are shown in Table 2. Mean anxiety and
depression scores for interviewees were significantly
higher than for those who were not interviewed (see
Additional file 2), reflecting the purposive sampling used
to provide a sample across the continuum of psycho-
logical distress.
Data collection
Data were collected using semi-structured interviews
that followed an interview topic guide (see Additional
file 3). All participants were asked the same main ques-
tions whilst retaining the flexibility to explore partici-
pants’ responses
in
further
detail and
change
the
sequence and phrasing of questions where necessary.
Interviews were arranged at a time and location
chosen by the participant and were digitally audio-
recorded. Fifteen interviews were conducted face-to-
face, either at participants’ homes (n = 12) or on Univer-
sity premises (n = 3), with the remainder conducted by
telephone (n = 4). Partners were able to take part in the
interview at the discretion of the male participant; five
chose couple interviews, requiring informed consent
from each parent. Interviews ranged from 18 to 83 min
(mean 47, s.d. 18.5). Member checking was conducted
during the interview through a process of ‘circling back’
to clarify participants’ interpretation, understanding and
meaning using prompts such as “Can you tell me more
about that?” “What do you mean when you said, …?”.
Analysis
Interviews were transcribed verbatim by a confidentiality-
bound professional transcription service, then checked for
accuracy by the respective interviewer (ZD/PG). Data
were managed using NVivo 10 and analysed according to
the thematic analysis approach described by Braun and
Clarke [40].
Transcripts were independently coded line-by-line by
three researchers (ZD, PG, SH) to generate initial codes
and search for candidate themes. Coding was an induct-
ive and data-driven process, not informed by an a priori
framework. The candidate themes and sub-themes were
reviewed and refined in a face-to-face meeting, with in-
put from another researcher (LMc). Additional file 4
summarises the development of the themes, an excerpt
of the data analysis audit trail. To help ensure the rigour
of
the
analysis,
we
undertook
a
process
of
peer
debriefing, which involved the researchers scrutinising
and providing feedback on the appropriateness of each
other’s interpretations and searching for disconfirming
evidence (deviant cases). Further discussions took place

Reflexive accounting
All researchers involved in the analysis (ZD, PG, SH,
LMc) have experience of gender-related qualitative re-
search on sensitive topics and are parents. At the time of
the interviews, both interviewers (ZD, PG) had children
of similar ages to those babies’ whose parents were inter-
viewed. All of the authors believe that fathers’ mental
health is a significant health concern, but hold mixed
views concerning the feasibility of routine assessment of
fathers’ mental health.
Results
We identified four major themes pertaining to men’s
experiences and views of perinatal mental health:
i) legitimacy of paternal stress and entitlement to
health professionals’ support;
ii) protecting the partnership;
iii)navigating fatherhood;
iv) diversity of men’s support networks.
Theme 1. Legitimacy of paternal stress and entitlement to
health professionals’ support
Common across fathers’ accounts was a tacit acceptance
of the existence of paternal stress which was often com-
bined with a questioning of their entitlement to having
these feelings, and to its recognition by others.
Articulating and attributing stress
Men predominantly couched their discussion around
‘stress’ rather than mental health. Descriptions across
the time course indicated that their stress during preg-
nancy had mainly been connected to anxieties around
the birth, this was particularly the case for those who
had experienced a previous difficult birth. Overwhelm-
ingly, men reported greater stress in the postnatal
period, adjusting to the demands of early parenting (spe-
cifically, those associated with sleep and feeding) and
their altered relationship with their partner. Men’s de-
scriptions centred on ‘role strain’ and ‘role conflict’
, not-
ing the loss of their former life and activities – and
associated relaxation - and ongoing struggles to balance
competing roles and priorities at work and home; strug-
gles that were often compounded by being geographic-
ally distant from theirs and their partner’s families.
I think for me it’s just - the never having any time to
relax, it’s just not possible. I’ve got a stressful job then I
come home and I tend to get … the tired, stressed baby
… I think the stress for me is just the non-stop-ness of
it (Father 12)
Some men made reference to specific stressors; includ-
ing discrete events (e.g. traumatic birth) and ongoing
difficulties (e.g. chronic health of a parent or child);

parents.
There was a tendency for men to minimise the diffi-
culties that they had experienced and emphasise the
challenges faced by their partner, with some questioning
the legitimacy of their own mental health needs:
I’m always conscious that [partner]’s got it a lot worse,
so I just sort of get on with it. (Father 2)
Whereas some men spoke of their partner’s postnatal
depression, none used this terminology in describing
their own experiences. Two men – both first-time fa-
thers - did however report recent and ongoing depres-
sion for which they had seen their GP and been
prescribed anti-depressant medication.
Symptoms and manifestation
Asked to describe their stress and its nature, men spoke
more readily of their cognitive, as opposed to emotional,
symptoms of distress. This mainly concerned guilt about
being unable to support their partner due to being at
work, but some also reflected on their guilt about their
feelings, believing that they ‘shouldn’t’ be struggling.
Minimising feelings and becoming more irritable with
their partner were common reactions to stress, particu-
larly in the early postnatal period.
I felt guilty actually, guilty going back to work and
leaving [partner] with everything. …I was like, I’ve left
them all day on their own. I don’t think that’s how she
felt but that’s how I felt. (Father 3)
I tend to do the typical man thing of hiding it until I
can do so no longer. … I’m not the sort to wail and
shout and whatever. … I probably just get grumpy and
a bit snappy about stuff. That’s pretty much it really.
(Father 12)
More commonly, the men volunteered that they had ex-
perienced physical and behavioural signs, including diffi-
culty concentrating at work and suffering with headaches.
Men mostly attributed their symptoms to exhaustion, and
often found it difficult to disentangle their mental stress
from symptoms that were seen to link with fatigue.
… something physically is going on, on top of the
mental stress.... I felt mentally drained as well and
tired, but once the physical aspect came into the
whole situation as well, that’s when I went to the
GP. (Father 19)

 In the majority of couple interviews, disclosures about
the psychological and emotional challenges men had ex-
perienced were prompted by discussions between part-
ners. For example:
Partner of Father 6: You went into yourself, I feel.
Father 6: Yes, I could feel myself withdraw, so I
wouldn’t communicate as much and I would get
snappy when sometimes I wouldn’t do. It was
something that if I was already close to it, it would be
the minutest of things that sometimes would just make
me lose it, not lose it, but kind of just [pause]
Partner of Father 6: You’d just go off and be very quiet,
don’t you, and don’t speak.
Partner of Father 7: I don’t think you slept very well
[in pregnancy].
Father 7: No. I never sleep very well.
Partner of Father 7: I don’t know whether I didn’t sleep
because I was stressed or because I was pregnant, I
don’t know, but I think you didn’t. It probably affected
you in that way, didn’t it?
Father 7: Yeah. I haven’t slept as well since you got
pregnant … It could be worry, or just concerned for
her, thinking about the future, about how it would pan
out and how we would do things, and just like not
being able to switch off properly more than anything.
It was notable that the two men who reported having
consulted their GP in relation to their mental health
described more marked symptoms:
In the end I just couldn’t function… I wasn’t myself. I
couldn’t even make simple decisions. (Father 6)
I felt so ill, I just wanted to die. I just thought this is
awful. (Father 10)
Entitlement to health professionals’ support
Whilst there were examples of men having felt included
by health professionals (for example, by being given
breakfast on an antenatal ward), many felt excluded and
unclear of their own role when in contact with maternity
services, particularly at the birth. Men who had described
feeling alienated/left out tended to qualify this by empha-
sising that the focus ‘should’ be on the mother and baby:
I think at the birth I felt a bit more like a spare part,
but then again I mean they were really good with
[partner], I just felt in the way sort of thing. (Father 2)
[The midwife]’s interested in [partner] and knowing
that I was supporting her, but not so much as me,
which, they can’t involve everyone, or take a
responsibility for everyone … I very much felt like it’s
certainly not about me, this. But at the same time, I
do very much appreciate the limited resources. They
can’t be responsible for everyone. The pregnant woman
is the priority, isn’t she. (Father 18)
Evident in men’s descriptions were feelings of conflict
about wanting to be more involved, and a questioning as
to whether this may detract from the support provided
to women; a situation compounded by limited contact
with health professionals and the short, ‘rushed’ appoint-
ments often highlighted by men (and their partners,
when present at the interview).
I didn’t feel like I could raise it [questions about
previous difficult birth] when I went to the sessions
with the midwife beforehand because I thought it was
mainly focusing on [partner] and the baby and
measurements and all that sort of thing … I think I
was thinking, well, [partner]’s pregnant here, they’re
focusing on her, I don’t want to sort of drag it out by
15/20 minutes, because of appointments and that, with
me asking maybe what seem trivial questions but to me
may be important … I was lost there, I suppose. (Father 3)
Having an unmet need in the context of a perceived
under-resourced health service meant that whilst most
men were receptive to and often welcomed the sugges-
tion that fathers’ emotional wellbeing might usefully be
addressed alongside that of mothers’
, in the future, al-
most all expressed concerns about the impact this may
have on existing provision to support women’s mental
health. Of note were a minority of men who did not feel
the need to ask fathers about their mental health and
wellbeing, with one describing it as “surplus to require-
ments” (Father 17).
I would be thinking are there going to be the funds to
like assist (.) even if I wanted some assistance, how are
they actually going to be able to-? There is a shortage
of [GPs] nationally so therefore me then going to the
GP and saying, you know - if it was affecting me
mentally, I’d feel almost like bad about it, I think I’m
wasting their time right here, they’ve got people to see
who are in more immediate need or something and,
you know, so I probably just like hold it in a bit more.
(Father 14)
Men were also conflicted as to which health profes-
sional would be best placed to have these conversations,
given fathers’ limited contact with services and their
Darwin et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth  (2017) 17:45 
Page 6 of 15
 perceived role of midwives (both an emphasis on the
woman/pregnancy and on physical rather than emo-
tional health). Some also questioned whether men in
general would give ‘honest’ answers to questions about
their mental health, although emphasised that they
themselves would. It was notable that the two fathers
who had accessed mental health support in the perinatal
period did so via their GPs, not maternity services.
Theme 2. Protecting the partnership
Central to the majority of men’s accounts were reflec-
tions on how their relationship with their partner had
evolved during the perinatal period and been affected by
their baby’s arrival. Here, men placed great emphasis on
their perceived need to protect both their partner, and
their partnership. Most spoke about having less time as
a couple since their baby’s birth but it was striking that
for many men – both those interviewed individually and
with their partners - their primary support and confi-
dante continued to be their partner and not friends or
other family members. Some men recognised an altered
emotional connection with their partners, including feel-
ing more distant. Such comments alluded to having lost
some of their own emotional support from their partner;
however this was rarely explicitly articulated by men,
possibly reflecting their feelings of not being ‘entitled’ to
support as indicated in the first theme.
[our] communications have gone through peaks and
troughs. … During her pregnancy we were. I think we
probably found ourselves closer actually during it, not
that we were far apart before but I think it did…
You’ve obviously come together to see this thing
growing…. [Now] I probably don’t get the interaction
so much with her (Father 13)
I think trying to juggle all of that and this child and
you know, your relationship is the thing that takes the
biggest hit. So I think it’s finding the time…and I think
on the surface you probably think you’re okay, because
you have a chat when you get in, but … before you know
it you’ve not spent any time with each other or spoke to
each other … we were probably just not really talking or
not interacting with each other, we were just kind of
existing … we sort of just never really reconnected … It’s
really just facing it, just talk and be honest with them.
But you need time to do it and also you need to both be
in the same receptive mood. (Father 1)
The loss of a previous ‘closeness’ was entwined with
men’s perceived need to support their partner with her
new or altered role, identity, and, for several fathers, her
distress and altered mood. Men’s sense of their role as a
supporter was overt and often drawn upon when trying
to reconcile the legitimacy of their own stress with their
feelings that it ‘should’ be the mother who is the focus
of supportive care.
…not being able to see as much of [baby] as I would
like to [is] stressful as well trying to - worrying about
looking after both of them. … kind of giving [partner]
support, as well, with her return to work. She is
obviously quite upset about having to leave a 1 year
old. (Father 15)
For most fathers, the parents’ ‘team work’ was viewed
as fundamental to coping with the demands of parenting
and ‘navigating fatherhood’.
There’s always been the shared responsibility of if we
see the other person getting a bit stressed up by it then
the other person takes him away. (Father 13)
She’s been very stressed and when she’s stressed I’m
stressed, that’s how it goes … I try to make life easy for
her and that means I do more and get more. It’s a
team. So it’s been a bit fraught but I think we’re kind
of coming out of it a bit now. (Father 12)
Less common were reports of participants struggling
to understand their partner’s perspectives and experi-
ences, both physical and emotional, which could be a
source of strain in the relationship. Such tensions were
apparent in the interviews involving men’s partners, al-
though not necessarily articulated explicitly. Feeling lost
as to how to support their partner’s mental health, some
men drew on practical approaches and problem-solving
strategies:
I struggled at times because whilst I could see of the
physical effects on [partner], I couldn’t understand the
emotional and mental effects it was having on her, so I
struggled with that, and I probably did become a bit
more snappy, definitely low mood at times and struggling
to sort of sleep properly, and you have a lot to think
about as well so you’re trying to do everything, trying to
make sure that we’re ready but also ready with the house
and you’ve got so much to sort of think about (Father 6)
There’ll be times when she’s positive and absolutely
fine and sometimes it goes the other way and she can’t
cope and then we just argue …I try to do longer hours,
just get up early and go to bed very late and work as
hard as I can all the time. (Father 8)
Theme 3. Navigating fatherhood
Rather than engage in conversation about how they
managed their mental health and wellbeing or accessed
Darwin et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth  (2017) 17:45 
Page 7 of 15
 support, most men preferred to emphasise what had
‘worked’ in managing stress, focusing on their strategies
for
bolstering
resilience
and
successfully
navigating
fatherhood. With the exception of one man (who stated
that he had not wanted to be a father), men judged their
performance against their aspiration to be a ‘good
father’. Being a good father included being a ‘provider’
and ‘protector’ and was seen to extend beyond stereo-
typical ideals around financial responsibility, to encom-
pass a ‘hands on’ role with their baby and providing
effective practical and emotional support to their part-
ner. Thus, for these men, being a ‘good father’ was syn-
onymous with being a ‘good partner’
, and ‘protecting the
partnership’ (Theme 2) was inherent in navigating
fatherhood.
Feeling prepared and (changing) expectations
Reflecting on their early perinatal experiences, men
spoke of their role in preparing for the birth of their
child and for being a parent with examples of reading
books, watching TV, talking to others, attending ante-
natal appointments and antenatal education classes,
alongside practical preparations around the house. Most
noted however that they had not felt ‘truly’ prepared and
parenting only became ‘real’ once they were ‘doing’ it.
Whilst this was an observation shared by both fathers
and mothers in the couple interviews, the lack of prepar-
ation appeared heightened for men, who often noted an
absence of information and resources that were tailored
and targeted towards them.
In comparing the experiences of first-time fathers and
subsequent fathers it was evident that past experience
could offer some learning but could also provoke anx-
iety, such as those concerning the birth.
We wanted to extend the family, have another child
but at the back of my mind I was thinking, oh, we’re
going to go through this labour again, which was hell
last time, basically. … As we approached due date, I
was getting less sleep due to worrying about it, but
once it was there, we just got on with it. (Father 3)
In addition, subsequent fathers faced new challenges
in meeting the needs of both children.
The first time round I didn’t have a clue, the second
time round you have a clue but it’s still really scary …
Losing the world we had before them was quite scary
the first time round, and it hit me quite hard again …
your world starts to come back together and then you
have another one and it’s harder again because you’ve
got two kids and two parents really … so the other one
in a way has to kind of entertain [the older child].
(Father 1)
You didn’t know how the [older child] was going to
react with the new born … it’s not just coping with the
pregnancy but it’s coping with explaining to the first
(Father 11)
Most men spoke of the reassurance that they took
from coming to have the perspective that many of the
challenges were ‘just a phase’; this was particularly
voiced by subsequent fathers in comparing their experi-
ences with their younger children. Some men reflected
on the importance
of changing
their expectations,
acknowledging that some of their stress reflected an un-
realistic standard that they and their partners had set for
themselves.
Even though it wasn’t by the book, but it made our
lives a lot easier and that I think helped as well, not
listening to what everyone told us (Father 6)
We felt this pressure building up the more we read, so
that’s why we said, like, just trust our instincts (Father 19)
Managing stress through distraction, denial and release
Taking a practical approach to coping with and man-
aging stress was common in men’s accounts. Some fa-
thers reported finding that the stresses relating to
pregnancy and parenting differed to those encountered
elsewhere, testing their usual coping strategies and
sometimes leaving them feeling powerless:
I’m probably the sort of bloke who actually just says,
‘oh I’m quite forgetful, so I can forget I’ve had the
worst night ever’. I just try and forget it. So that’s
probably my coping mechanism. It’s just, trying to
forget it and I generally do. And then, I guess, I’ve
found in some ways, work quite helpful in that respect,
because you can have a crazy night where you have no
idea what’s going on with [son’s name], but I can go to
work and I feel fine. I’m in control here, I know what
to do. There’s people who I can actually communicate
with, they’ll do what I ask them to do and vice versa.
So I’m probably not the best example, the best person
to ask, because I think I just choose to ignore. I’m
probably more of an ignorer, which isn’t probably that
helpful for [partner]. (Father 18)
I think the way I deal with things in general and in
work and things, I tend to think quite far ahead. Like I
said, I’m quite regimented. So where there’s something
like that, like, fatherhood and things that I can’t
control and I can’t regiment them and put in a plan
and things like that, I find it quite hard to digest. If
there’s something I can control, a plan and put in a
Gantt chart, great, I can deal with that. And things
Darwin et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth  (2017) 17:45 
Page 8 of 15
 outside of that, you know, are a bit more chaotic. I
find I struggle when I have to think them through a lot
and maybe verbalise them with [partner]. (Father 17)
Where task-oriented strategies to tackle the sources of
stress were deemed unavailable or inadequate, men
managed their feelings of stress in practical ways, with
mixed success. This included using sport as a way to re-
lieve stress, offering distraction and physical release of ten-
sion, as well as a form of peer support. Several men spoke
of using work as a distraction whereas for others work was
a source of stress, limiting their ability to help at home.
I like my work because it’s technical stuff, I know I can
bury myself in it and that will take my mind off it.
(Father 7)
Another, who was unemployed, spoke of housework as
a welcome distraction:
I was just pottering about, just trying to keep occupied
with anything I could, the flat was sparkling when she
got home, just anything to keep my mind off the fact
that I wasn’t with her. (Father 9)
Whilst most men acknowledged teamwork with their
partners and sharing of practical tasks, they often noted
that they ultimately resorted to taking a self-reliant and
stoical attitude when deemed necessary. Here, perceived
expectations of masculinity as well as negative attitudes
towards depression were evident in some accounts:
I’d just get on with it. I would just deal with it myself.
That’s what I’ve always done. I think it tends to be a
male reaction for most people (Father 8)
… there’s always the fear, if you open yourself up and
you explain how you are feeling emotionally, like
blokes will, sort of, ridicule you … don’t be so airy
fairy, you know, that, sort of thing … just because
blokes try and act all macho and stuff (Father 14)
I am a depressive, I’m depressed right now, have been
for a few days. … I don’t think, in any stretch of the
imagination, I’m the image of the stereotypical man,
and yet I’m never going to be able to break out of the,
man up, get on with it thing. And I don’t know where
that’s come from, just it’s there. And I think generally,
that’s my approach. It’s just a case of head down,
battle on through (Father 10)
Strength through fatherhood as rewarding
Men’s coping capacity was often strengthened through
their positive and rewarding experiences of fatherhood;
something that grew with the child’s development and
her/his increasing ability to interact:
I think you cope through him as well, as he gets older.
I mean, just smiling to himself and being able to come
back and he recognises your face, that kind of stuff is a
huge coping strategy. It’s really rewarding, so that
makes it worth it. (Father 16)
The sleepless nights do take their toll on you, but I
don’t know if it’s just the way that I think … but I tend
to look at the bigger picture. I just think I’m happy
because she’s healthy, she’s smiling… So I think, well, I
must be doing something half right for her to be
trotting around as she does, and she’s happy with me.
(Father 7)
Fatherhood could also bolster men’s capacity for man-
aging other external stressors:
But I think as much as having [baby] has caused me
to feel more susceptible I think to everything going on,
at the same time having him has given me a focus
because when I’ve had the energy doing things with
him has just taken my mind completely off everything
because there’s nothing more sort of enjoyable
sometimes than when you’re just doing things with
him, whereas other times you just are thinking you just
want to switch off and have a bit of break. (Father 6)
Occasionally men admitted their feelings of rejection
or being ‘pushed out’ by the closeness between their
baby and partner, and spoke of the importance of having
‘father-baby’ time or activities.
[For women] it becomes about me and bump, and
then me and baby. Whereas fathers, it’s about them,
you know, them two over there and me. You feel
part of that unit but nonetheless, you’re always
separated slightly… that’s just how it is. (Father 10)
Paternity leave was valued highly, and most men com-
mented that it had not been long enough. Whilst none
had chosen to share parental leave some changed their
working hours to spend more time with their baby and
to relieve their partner from caring for their child. Sev-
eral men voiced the need to ensure not only time with
their baby but also to protect their time, “keeping that
family unit strong” (Father 6), again noting the signifi-
cance of the partnership.
Theme 4. Diversity of men’s support networks
There was a great deal of diversity in fathers’ support
networks, including difference in their relationships and
Darwin et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth  (2017) 17:45 
Page 9 of 15
 interactions with other men. Whilst a minority spoke of
‘keeping
themself
to
themself’
(coupled
with
self-
reliance), most described a range of people they drew
support from, although they varied in the ways that they
used this support.
Despite the apparent support networks available to
men, their accounts revealed a lack of resources, with
several
lamenting
the
absence
of
tailored
and
targeted information and some noting the paucity of
groups
for
fathers
and
male-friendly
parenting
environments.
Pre-existing networks - friends, family and the wider
community
Men spoke of existing relationships that offered ways
to ‘casually’ explore concerns and gain reassurance,
without the need to access formal support. Several
men mentioned family - either theirs or their part-
ner’s
-
who
provided
reassurance
about
common
complaints and health anxieties with young children.
Often this support and advice came from siblings or
mothers, rather than fathers, with some men acknow-
ledging the changing involvement of fathers between
generations.
We didn’t know what was wrong [when baby was
teething], and I think neither of us was able to
reassure the other. But, in those situations, we’ve had
other people that have been able to add a bit of a
perspective. (Father 4)
Several men relayed conversations that they had had
with other fathers in their wider social networks; includ-
ing colleagues and neighbours. Sometimes, these were
brief conversations in passing, whereas others were on-
going, in-depth discussions. For these men, the discus-
sions
allowed
them
to
talk
about
babies
and
relationships, alongside topics that did not include these
aspects and offered a welcome distraction.
It was just like, how is your respective other half
getting on? … a couple of blokey conversations of, oh
she’s doing my head in today, kind of thing … It was
just nice just to have that male bonding really, which
perhaps my dad and [partner]’s dad didn’t really
have. It was almost they had their male friends but
they didn’t talk about it… it was nice to have them as
a support if you needed or more likely just to have a
normal conversation. You didn’t have to be talking
about babies and pregnancy and nurseries and
everything that goes with it all the time. It was there if
you wanted it but you could have a bit of a
normalised day to day conversation with them without
it. (Father 13)
[At work] I can cover an awful lot of different things
with them… And in a lot of cases, it is bloke banter.
You wouldn’t think that it [but] you’re in the middle of
an engineering workshop surrounded by blokes, and we
probably spend half the day talking about babies and
kids and that sort of thing. But I feel more comfortable
with it, because I know that there’s guys there that
have had similar experiences or they know what it’s
like. They know how I’m feeling if I say, oh, we’ve had
a rough night … Some people have had worse
experiences, so you think, what we’re going through is
normal. (Father 7)
‘Formal’ peer support and opportunities to meet other fathers
Men were split on their attitudes towards formal peer
support and groups. Some discussed their experiences of
mother and baby groups and the lack of equivalent
groups for fathers.
I think in some ways it would be helpful before and
after to make sure that dads are prepared and that
they’re coping and maybe even if it was just away from
the mums for some people maybe, because I think
some dads might find it a bit embarrassing to sort of
say I don’t know what I’m doing. (Father 6)
Some men described positive experiences of ‘gendered’
events and gatherings with members of their antenatal
education classes, after their baby’s birth; however this
was limited to experiences of classes accessed privately
via the National Childbirth Trust (NCT).
Men’s descriptions indicated that conversations in
these groups were characterised as ‘war stories’ and ‘ban-
ter’ (Father 16), rather than overtly tackling the emo-
tional aspects of pregnancy and parenting; nonetheless,
these could offer venting and validation from peers with
similar experiences.
You know we do talk to each other about parenting
stuff but … it’s never a serious conversation, it’s all,
done over a beer you know and a few jokes, which is
good. (Father 1)
If people haven’t got, like I’ve been fortunate enough to
know other guys going through a similar thing. I can
imagine, yeah, you probably do want to just at least
know that you’re not alone. Even if you don’t want to
talk about it, just to know, actually, he hasn’t had any
sleep either. (Father 18)
Again, there was evidence of some men feeling
conflicted
about
wanting
or
needing
emotional
support.
Darwin et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth  (2017) 17:45 
Page 10 of 15
 I’d feel like I maybe shouldn’t want to want some
support, and that I should be fine and I should just get
by, and actually I have so did I need it? Probably not.
Would it would be nice? Yes, maybe. Would I have
gone? Different question again, maybe not. (Father 16)
If I’m there and I say, you know, I’m feeling down or
whatever they’ll more than likely punch me in the arm
and get me a beer and tell me to shut up, which is
what I need I think. (Father 17)
Some men vocalised that they would view fathers’
groups as ‘forced’
, questioning their value and preferring
to use their own informal support; these pre-existing re-
lationships appeared to enable greater expression and
discussion of more sensitive topics, where it was wanted.
Lack of information resources tailored to men
There was a common desire among fathers to have more
information about pregnancy and parenting, and most
expressed a preference for information that was geared
towards fathers.
I wouldn’t have a clue how to go about [accessing
groups for fathers]. … with [partner], she can go online
and find 28 different chat rooms … I don’t know if
those things even exist [for fathers] and I wouldn’t
know where to look. (Father 1)
Father 3: Yes, what I’m saying is I need pointing in the
right direction of going onto MUMbler or whatever.
Partner of Father 3: You’d have to join it.
Father 3: Well, yes, but as a man, I would not
necessarily know to go on to that site to find that
information. I wouldn’t even have given it a thought.
A few men were content accessing existing online re-
sources despite them being oriented towards mothers
(e.g. netmums), saying they were accessing it “as a par-
ent” (Father 4); of these one noted not wanting the
‘jokey’ communication used in male arenas.
I didn’t really get on with the dads’ [forums] … they
were quite jokey …I guess I wanted just someone to
say,‘yeah, this is normal, that’s fine, you know, it gets
better’, or whatever. (Father 2)
I wouldn’t know if there is anything, the equivalent
for dads, I’ve not really set out to look that
specifically, I’ve just come at it more as being a
parent … I absolutely would [feel comfortable using
netmums] more than happy to look for help, advice,
and other people’s experience anywhere really.
(Father 4)
Many spoke of the value they placed on examples that
were based on other men’s experiences, and the need for
more information that was not just about being a father
but also about supporting their partner – including with
their psychological health. Fathers also acknowledged
that some men did not feel comfortable accessing classes
and recognised that written materials may be more ac-
ceptable to some men, offering a route to further infor-
mation and support, as needed or wanted.
I really enjoyed reading [the Dads’ handbook] …
because a lot of it was based on other people’s
experiences so you realise you’re not in the boat by
yourself, that there are other people that have been
through it and obviously it’s a natural thing that
everyone does every day… it made me think about
things that I hadn’t thought about or think less about
things that I had been thinking about. So that was
probably a big thing for me. (Father 6)
Perhaps if there was some sort of dads thing, like a
bounty pack [information pack provided to mothers in
England] which is just for dads. Okay, yeah, it’s got
baby stuff in it as well, but it’s baby stuff that the dads
would - and I know it’s hard because it shouldn’t
matter whether you’re a male or a female really
should i … So I don’t think you necessarily want to say
right, here is a thing just for dads. But I do think you
need something that’s quite directed at them. (Father 1)
Discussion
This interpretive qualitative study adds to the limited
evidence on men’s experiences and perceptions of pater-
nal perinatal mental health. We sought to examine views
and experiences of paternal mental health and wellbeing
amongst first-time and subsequent fathers across the
continuum of psychological distress, as indicated by self-
report measures of depression and anxiety symptoms.
The study identified that although men experience psy-
chological distress in the perinatal period they may ques-
tion the legitimacy of their experiences, foregrounding
their partner’s needs. Fathers framed their experiences
around stress and navigating fatherhood, central to
which was their intra-parent partnership. Whilst men
described a diverse range of support networks, evident
in their accounts was the paucity of resources that were
tailored specifically to men’s information needs and pref-
erences, coupled with some resistance to formal forms
of support (e.g. groups).
Aspects of men’s accounts in this study resonated with
the themes identified in Edhborg et al.’s (2015) study of
fathers with depressive symptoms, specifically those re-
lating to ‘stress’ arising from changes in relationships
with partners and balancing the competing demands of
family, work, and their own needs. Our findings also
Darwin et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth  (2017) 17:45 
Page 11 of 15
 cohere with the results of meta-syntheses of qualitative
data concerning transitions to fatherhood [26–32] in-
cluding their aspirations to be ‘good fathers’
, and the
challenges of the loss of their previous life, altered rela-
tionships with their partners, feeling underprepared for
birth and parenting, and feeling excluded by services. By
including participants who were subsequent fathers, this
study identified that while these men may feel better
prepared by virtue of their previous experiences, there is
potential for paternal concerns surrounding previous
perinatal experiences including anxieties based on previ-
ous traumatic or difficult birth experiences, which have
been largely neglected in the wider literature. This iden-
tifies an opportunity where midwives and other health
professionals may discuss with both parents their previ-
ous birth experiences and address anxieties surrounding
future births, alongside birth choices.
Fathers in the current study showed preferences to
talk about ‘stress’ (rather than mental illness). This is
consistent with the wider men’s health literature [41]
and offers parallels with research concerning ‘maternal
distress’
, which encourages an approach to psychological
health that foregrounds the psychosocial context and the
challenges experienced in this transition period [42].
The men in this study also showed a preference to
focus on their successful navigation of fatherhood. Some
men may therefore find materials and resources which
promote psychological wellbeing more acceptable if they
place emphasis on fatherhood and resilience, i.e. the cap-
acity to cope with adversity, or salutogenesis, i.e. the
generation of wellbeing and how to promote health ra-
ther than treat illness [43].
The present study substantiates that materials and re-
sources are needed for fathers which recognise their
roles (both as a parent and as the mother’s supporter)
[44–46] but are also tailored to their needs as men, and
aligned with their masculine identities [22, 47]. Useful
here is the concept of a partner-oriented masculinity
proposed in a longitudinal study of work-sharing couples
[48] as this was clearly evident in the men’s accounts in
the current study. Relevant too is evidence of gendered
approaches to coping, which indicates that men tend to
favour problem-focused approaches and women favour
emotional-focused approaches [49, 50]. Fathers in this
study felt frustration where their default coping strat-
egies were less effective in the context of the perinatal
period. Such differences in coping styles and strategies
need to be considered both for improving fathers’ psy-
chological wellbeing and in supporting them to provide
effective partner support.
By explicitly framing discussions around mental health
and wellbeing, our study has generated new insights
around men’s questioning of the legitimacy of their men-
tal health needs and their entitlement to support from
health professionals in the context of their partner’s
needs and a perceived under-resourced health service.
The findings echo a Swedish postnatal questionnaire
study which concluded that fathers prioritise their part-
ners’ needs and are often “not comfortable when too
much interest is focused on their own health and emo-
tional wellbeing” (p.427) [51]. Men in the current study
expressed openness to discussion of their wellbeing but
voiced concerns that addressing fathers’ mental health
needs may compete with meeting the needs of mothers,
who they stated ‘should’ be the focus of care.
Tailored resources for men may promote psychological
wellbeing and help to prevent deterioration in mental
health but some fathers will have mental health needs
that require more intensive intervention. Few interven-
tions exist for men [25] and men may feel more com-
fortable with partner-inclusive interventions that are
targeted primarily at women’s mental health, such as
those reviewed elsewhere [24]. Support that is couched
around the father’s role as supporter and co-parent ra-
ther than identifying as themselves being ‘in need’ may
be more attractive to men, and particularly if aligned
with the evidence that fathers’ positive involvement with
infants when mothers are depressed improves treatment
outcomes for the mothers with depression [52]. This
would cohere with evidence from the wider men’s health
literature that suggests men often need to find ‘legitim-
ate’ ways to access health services that do not challenge
(western)
culturally-dominant
masculine
ideals
em-
bodied by strength, stoicism and emotional control [53].
Such an approach may also be the most feasible in the
context of pressures facing services given that, even in
high-resource settings, fewer than 50% of women with
perinatal depression or anxiety seek help or are identi-
fied; only 10–15% of those receive effective treatment
[13]. Issues such as these are also relevant when consid-
ering the feasibility of assessing fathers’ mental health,
both the possibility of universal assessment of all men
(mirroring the approach adopted with mothers) and a
case-finding approach with men whose partners are
known to have perinatal mental health problems. Adopt-
ing the latter has been suggested elsewhere [54] and
likely offers a more efficient use of resources with mater-
nal perinatal mental health problems being the greatest
risk factor for perinatal anxiety and depression in men
[55]. However, a targeted approach risks missing men
with mental health problems whose partners do not have
an identified need.
It is unknown, both for fathers and for mothers,
whether mental health assessment would be more ac-
ceptable and effective if assessed together or separately.
In most of the couple interviews in the current study,
descriptions of symptoms and manifestation of stress in
both partners appeared to be prompted by partners’
Darwin et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth  (2017) 17:45 
Page 12 of 15
 discussions; however there was one example where the
father’s description of his anxieties appeared to be closed
down by his partner’s comments. In addition, given the
language used by men when describing their stress and
its manifestation – including physical symptomatology -
further research should examine whether male-specific
measures of perinatal mental health in the perinatal
period are needed [56].
Limitations
Using the BaBY cohort as a sampling framework of-
fered
an
efficient
design,
maximising
existing
re-
sources
which
is
particularly
important
given
the
publicly funded nature of research. The sample was
however limited in several ways due to this approach
and through the analysis process it was deemed that
data saturation had not been achieved. Firstly, fathers
were recruited to the cohort via the baby’s mother
and contact in this study involved writing to the ad-
dress provided. All fathers in this study were residing
with their partner (and all were their baby’s biological
father, although this was not a requirement of partici-
pation in the cohort) and it is likely that the central-
ity of the partner relationship and the aspiration of
‘good father’ being intertwined with ‘good partner’
would be different in fathers who are not in a rela-
tionship with their baby’s mother; in addition none of
the parents had children from previous relationships.
This study has been limited to fathers and male part-
ners due to approaching perinatal mental health from
a men’s health perspective; the extent to which these
findings reflect role versus gender is unknown and it
is acknowledged that there is a dearth of research
concerning same-sex parents.
Secondly, fathers were interviewed when their baby
was aged approximately 5–10 months, by which time
most reported that their lives had become more ‘settled’
(and less stressful) than in the preceding months. Re-
search is needed that uses longitudinal interviews with
fathers to determine their changing needs and associated
implications for identification and management of pater-
nal mental illness and paternal psychological distress.
Thirdly, the cohort lacked diversity concerning ethnicity
and socioeconomic background, both of which are rele-
vant to the construction of fatherhood and potentially
intersections with views concerning paternal perinatal
mental health.
It is encouraging that the men willing to be inter-
viewed did not differ from those identified as eligible in
the BaBY cohort on the known characteristics – i.e. the
MHWB scores – and it appears that this is a topic of
interest to men whose experiences span the continuum
of perinatal mental health and wellbeing.
Conclusions
The perinatal period can be a time of psychological adjust-
ment and role strain for both parents. Paternal perinatal
anxiety and depression presents a significant public health
concern with implications for men and their families. The
current study shows that fathers may feel reluctant and
unable to express their support needs or seek help and
question the legitimacy of their experiences; an issue that
can be compounded by prioritising their partner’s needs
and feeling excluded by services which they perceive to be
under-resourced. Our findings add support to calls for tai-
lored and targeted resources to be developed for men. We
propose developing and evaluating information resources
in different modalities (i.e. printed, online) that are made
more accessible by being framed around fatherhood and
including reference to stress and behaviours (rather than
exclusively mental health and ‘symptoms’). Our research
indicates that such resources might usefully be aligned
with fathers’ family-oriented masculine ideals, emphasis-
ing the value of men’s self-care with reference to their role
as protector. Further research is needed with a more di-
verse range of fathers and other stakeholders, to inform
how best to identify and manage paternal perinatal mental
health needs, in the context of current service provision.

Funding
The study was supported by the White Rose University Consortium
Collaboration Fund which exists to promote collaboration across the
Universities of Leeds, York and Sheffield. The funds covered data collection
costs (including postage, travel expenses and transcription), project meeting
costs and the fund for this open access publication. Researchers’ time was
not directly funded.
Availability of data and materials
The transcripts are not made available because, whilst the names of places
and people have been removed, the combination of contextual information
given by participants could compromise their anonymity if the transcripts
were available in their entirety.
