Summary
Background Little is known about how the proportions of dependency states have changed between generational 
cohorts of older people. We aimed to estimate years lived in different dependency states at age 65 years in 1991 and 
2011, and new projections of future demand for care.
Methods In this population-based study, we compared two Cognitive Function and Ageing Studies (CFAS I and 
CFAS II) of older people (aged ≥65 years) who were permanently registered with a general practice in three defined 
geographical areas (Cambridgeshire, Newcastle, and Nottingham; UK). These studies were done two decades apart 
(1991 and 2011). General practices provided lists of individuals to be contacted and were asked to exclude those who had 
died or might die over the next month. Baseline interviews were done in the community and care homes. Participants 
were stratified by age, and interviews occurred only after written informed consent was obtained. Information collected 
included basic sociodemographics, cognitive status, urinary incontinence, and self-reported ability to do activities of 
daily living. CFAS I was assigned as the 1991 cohort and CFAS II as the 2011 cohort, and both studies provided 
prevalence estimates of dependency in four states: high dependency (24-h care), medium dependency (daily care), low 
dependency (less than daily), and independent. Years in each dependency state were calculated by Sullivan’s method. 
To project future demands for social care, the proportions in each dependency state (by age group and sex) were 
applied to the 2014 UK population projections.
Findings Between 1991 and 2011, there were significant increases in years lived from age 65 years with low dependency 
(1·7 years [95% CI 1·0–2·4] for men and 2·4 years [1·8–3·1] for women) and increases with high dependency 
(0·9 years [0·2–1·7] for men and 1·3 years [0·5–2·1] for women). The majority of men’s extra years of life were spent 
independent (36·3%) or with low dependency (36·3%) whereas for women the majority were spent with low 
dependency (58·0%), and only 4·8% were independent. There were substantial reductions in the proportions with 
medium and high dependency who lived in care homes, although, if these dependency and care home proportions 
remain constant in the future, further population ageing will require an extra 71 215 care home places by 2025.
Interpretation On average older men now spend 2·4 years and women 3·0 years with substantial care needs, and most 
will live in the community. These findings have considerable implications for families of older people who provide the 
majority of unpaid care, but the findings also provide valuable new information for governments and care providers 
planning the resources and funding required for the care of their future ageing populations.

Introduction
A common concern with increasing lifespan is that 
higher levels of disease will translate into a decline in 
capability and independence, with increased demands for 
health and social care services.1,2 Increased survival to very 
old ages does not always result in more disability and 
dependency at a population level because of selective 
mortality of the most dependent;3 however, whether this 
observation will continue with further advances in 
medical technology remains unknown. Furthermore, a 
key challenge for ageing societies worldwide will be the 
projected decline in traditional sources of formal and 
unpaid care from families to support people living at 
home and in long-term residential care,4 and cuts to social 
care budgets that influence hospital discharge.5
The fastest growing section of the population is those 
aged 85 years and older,6 of whom up to 20% live 
independently and free from disability despite multi-
morbidity, but most will require care at some point.7,8 In 
part, this requirement for care is due to the exponential 
increase in dementia prevalence with age, although this 
cause might be alleviated as reductions in dementia prev-
alence have been seen in the past decades in the UK and 
USA,9,10 along with a substantial reduction in the years 
spent with cognitive impairment at least in women.11 By 
contrast, trends in disability for both countries have been

less positive with a substantial increase in years with 
mild disability.11,12
Disability profiles have been used for planning UK 
health and social care services but have assumed constant 
disability prevalence over time.13 Nevertheless, how dis-
ability relates to care needs is not obvious when disability 
is assessed by the number of activities of daily living 
requiring help or even when the hierarchical nature of 
activities14,15 defines disability severity. A more informative 
measure, the interval, reflects potential need for personal 
and household care, surveillance, and medical-related 
tasks such as taking medications, with severity based on 
the time interval between necessary periods of help.16 
Interval need was originally derived to measure the 
needs of older people for residential and community care 
services, and there have been a small number of surveys 
only, all UK based, that have estimated dependency on 
this basis.8,17
Many European countries are struggling to adequately 
fund their social care, due in part to the economic crisis; 
for example, Germany has increased the contribution rate 
to its long-term social insurance system.18 Projections to 
2021 of the service costs to maintain the current level of 
social care in England suggest an additional £940 million 
will be required, assuming a constant health profile of the 
older population.19 To date, there have been no com-
parisons that could inform the extent to which the current 
care crisis is due to greater levels of dependency than in 
previous generations, or simply more older people. Our 
study provides the first gen 
erational cohort comparison 
of the dependency profiles of people aged 65 years and 
older based on interval need. It uses baseline data from 
the two Cognitive Function and Ageing Studies (CFAS I 
and CFAS II) to establish whether dependency prevalence 
and years spent in different dependency states have 
changed in the past 20 years, and to model the effect of 
these findings on future demands for formal social care 
for older people in the UK.
Methods
Study design and participants
Full details of the study design, methods, and response 
rates have been published,10 and are repeated briefly here 
(a full description of the study design can be found in the 
appendix). In CFAS I, interviews were done between 
Aug 23, 1989, and June 13, 1994, in six geographical 
areas of the UK (Cambridgeshire, Gwynedd, Liverpool, 
Newcastle, Nottingham, and Oxford); and in CFAS II, 
they were done between Nov 13, 2008, and Nov 24, 2011, 
in three (Cambridgeshire, Newcastle, and Nottingham) 
of the original six geographical areas of the Medical 
Research Council’s CFAS but with the same study design 
and methods. Interviews occurred only after written 
informed consent was obtained. Ethics approval for 
CFAS I and CFAS II were obtained through the 
multicentre ethics committee and from relevant local 
research ethics committees.
Participants from CFAS I were assigned as the 
1991 cohort, and those from CFAS II were assigned as the 
2011 cohort. The target population for each cohort was 
people aged 65 years or older who were permanently 
registered with a participating general practice in the 
areas (including those in institutional care), each area 
providing 2500 individuals aged 65 years and older with 
stratification by age group (65–74 years vs ≥75 years; 
1250 per stratum per area). General practices provided 
lists of individuals to be contacted and were asked to 
exclude those who had died or might die over the next 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We updated a previous review of trends in health expectancies, 
searching MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science from Jan 1, 
2009, to Dec 31, 2016, with the search terms “healthy life 
years”, “free life expectancy”, “active life expectancy”, “healthy 
life expectancy”, “health expectancy”, “years of healthy life”, and 
“years with care needs”. We then excluded studies with only a 
single timepoint. Most studies focused on self-rated health or 
disability rather than dependency. Only two previous studies 
had estimated trends in years with care needs, both based on 
administrative data.
Added value of this study
Our measure of dependency, interval need, provides a greater 
transparency in the amount of care required than a simple 
count of activity limitations, and incorporates geriatric 
conditions such as incontinence and dementia, which are 
major predictors of long-term care use. We have shown that 
from age 65 years, older people can expect to spend on average 
between 4 years and 7·8 years with low dependency (care less 
than daily), 1·1 years, with medium dependency (care at set 
times daily), and between 1·3 years and 1·9 years with high 
dependency (24-h care). Current older people spend between 
1·7 years and 2·4 years more with low dependency and 
between 0·9 years and 1·3 years more with high dependency 
than the generation 20 years ago.
Implications of all the available evidence
Our research suggests that the current social care crisis is due 
not only to the increasing numbers of the very old, with their 
higher morbidity and greater health and social care use, but 
that current older people are spending more of their remaining 
life with low and high care needs. Low care needs have 
implications for family and friends who supply unpaid care 
because this low dependency is unlikely to meet eligibility 
criteria for publicly funded care. High care needs have 
considerable implications for future provision of community 
services and the state provision of funding for care.

month. Oversampling was used to allow for losses (death, 
incorrect registration, ineligibility, general practitioner 
refusals, and participant or gatekeeper refusal).
Data collection
Participants were interviewed in their normal place of 
residence—ie, their own home or care home. If cognitive 
impairment was judged to limit participants’ ability to 
provide reliable answers, proxy informants (generally 
spouses, offspring, or occasionally paid-for carers) were 
used. Information collected in CFAS I and CFAS II 
included basic sociodemographics (age, sex, marital 
status, living arrangements, and education); cognitive 
status, which was assessed by the mini-mental state 
exam 
ination;20 urinary incontinence; and self-reported 
ability to do activities of daily living.21
Assessment of dependency
Dependency was estimated with Isaacs and Neville’s16 
interval measure, which classifies participants on the 
basis of the lapsed time between periods when 
participants might require help. Four categories 
were used: inde 
pendent (participants for whom super-
vision or help for any activity was not essential), low 
dependency (required help less often than daily), 
medium dependency (required help at regular intervals 
each day), and high dependency (required 24-h 
care, because help might be needed at any time, or 
constant supervision needed). Relevant items to define 
dependency level are shown in the panel. If par 
ticipants 
were missing items but required help on higher 
dependency items, they were considered classifiable 
for dependency. We used the same allocation of activities 
to dependency categories as a previous study8 that had 
also validated the dependency measure against self-
reported frequency of help received with activities.
Statistical analysis
We calculated age and sex-specific dependency prevalence 
for CFAS I and CFAS II using inverse probability 
weighting to account for non-response differences between 
the studies and study design selection.10 Because of small 
numbers with medium or high dependency, to explore 
time differences in dependency prevalence we combined 
low, medium, and high dependency and fitted logistic 
regression models with time (0=1991, 1=2011), age (5-year 
age band), sex, and region; subsequently, we further 
adjusted for education (0–9 years, 10–11 years, or ≥12 years) 
and living arrangements (lives alone, with spouse, with 
others in community, or in care home). Education 
categories were chosen to reflect statutory schooling ages 
5–14 years (9 years of education) before 1947 (applicable to 
all the 1991 cohort), and ages 5–15 years (10 years of 
education) after 1947 (applicable to those approximately 
aged 65–80 years in the 2011 cohort). We examined 
whether time differences were accounted for by changes in 
the prevalence of diagnosed chronic disabling diseases 
that were self-reported: diabetes, hypertension, arthritis, 
chronic airway obstruction (asthma or chronic bronchitis, 
or both), stroke, or coronary heart disease (angina or heart 
attack, or both); and self-reported or interviewer observed 
geriatric conditions (hearing or eyesight problems).
We calculated the years lived in each of the four levels 
of dependency for the combined three regions common 
to CFAS I and CFAS II by sex for each timepoint 
(1991 and 2011), using Sullivan’s22 method, which applies 
the pre 
valence of each level of dependency to a standard 
life table for the same period and age structure. We also 
calculated abridged life tables from population mid-year 
estimates and vital statistics death data provided by the 
Office of National Statistics (ONS) at the district level for 
the three regions and the two timepoints. Incorporating 
a more precise value for ax (the fraction of interval lived 
by those dying in the interval), we calculated from 
national mor 
tality data for both years (by sex) rather than 
assuming deaths were uniformly distributed over the 
interval (ax=0·5). Life tables were closed at age 90 years 
(probability of death for age group ≥90 years was 1·0). 
We used the standard ONS methodology23 to calculate 
95% CIs for the health expectancies.
To project future demand for care to 2035, the pro-
portions in each dependency state were applied to the 
2014 UK population projections of those aged 65 years or 
older, by age group (65–74 years, 75–84 years, and 
≥85 years) and sex.
Health expectancies were calculated in R (version 3.0.3) 
and all other statistical analyses in SAS (version 9.4).

Results
In the three centres combined, 7635 participants took 
part in CFAS I and 7796 in CFAS II with similar age dis-
tributions in both cohorts (because of age stratification). 
However, CFAS II, compared with CFAS I, had a higher 
proportion of men, and lower proportions of those living 
alone or in care homes or with the least amount of 
education (0–9 years; table 1).
Dependency profiles changed between 1991 and 2011, 
with a greater proportion of participants with low depen 
d-
ency (requiring care less than daily; 28·7% in 1991 vs 32·4% 
in 2011) and high dependency (24-h care; 3·9% vs 5·9%; 
appendix). Nevertheless, the proportion of older people 
with substantial care needs (medium or high dependency) 
who were living in care homes reduced considerably for all 
age groups (figure 1). By 2011, 51·8% of those aged 85 years 
or older who had high dependency were in a care home, 
compared with 73·5% in 1991. After adjustment for age, 
sex, and region, dependency pre 
valence was significantly 
higher in 2011 than in 1991 (odds ratio [OR] 1·22, 95% CI 
1·15–1·30). This increase remained significant after further 
adjustment for cohort differences in living arrangements 
and levels of education (1·45, 1·34–1·56), and after 
adjustment for chronic disabling diseases and hearing and 
eyesight problems (1·21, 1·12–1·31).
Individual items comprising interval need were exam-
ined to ascertain which item had driven dependency 
changes (figure 2). Increases in high dependency over 
time were due to the significantly greater prevalence of 
help with toileting, being bed or chair bound, and being 
incontinent and requiring help dressing, whereas in-
creases in low dependency over time were due to signifi-
cantly higher prevalence of help required with cutting 
toenails, house 
work, shopping, and house tasks. Help 
with meal prep 
aration and bathing were the only items 
with lower prevalence in 2011 than in 1991 (figure 2).
In 2011, average life expectancy for men aged 65 years 
was 17·6 years of which 11·2 years (63·5%) was 
spent independent, 4 years (22·9%) was with low depen-
dency, 1·1 year (6·2%) was with medium de 
pendency, 
and 1·3 years (7·4%) was with high dependency (table 2). 
Women aged 65 years lived longer with an average life 
expectancy of 20·6 years but spent fewer absolute years 
(and as a proportion of life expectancy) independent 
(9·7 years [47·3%]) and more years with low dependency 
(7·8 years [37·8%]). Men and women spent similar years 
with medium and high dependency, both in absolute 
years and as a proportion of life expectancy (table 2).
Between 1991 and 2011, years spent independent after 
age 65 years increased significantly for men (1·7 years, 
95% CI 1·2–2·1) but not for women (0·2 years, 
–0·4 to 0·7), and both were significantly less than the 
increases in life expectancy (4·7 years for men vs 4·1 years 
for women) showing an expansion of dependency. Men 
and women in the 2011 cohort lived more years with low 
dependency (1·7 years [95% CI 1·0–2·4] for men, and 
2·4 years [1·8–3·1] for women) and high dependency 
(0·9 years [0·2–1·7] for men and 1·3 years [0·5–2·1] for 
women), and significantly greater proportions of life 
spent in these states (table 2). For men, most of their gain 
in life expectancy at age 65 years was spent independent 
(36·3%) or with low dependency (36·3%). By contrast, 
women had most of their gain in life expectancy with low 
dependency (58·0%) with only 4·8% independent.
By age 85 years, there were no significant differences over 
time in dependency states for men; however, for women, 
the significant increases in low and high dependency 
remained (appendix). Years spent with medium and high 
dependency are relatively constant with age (figure 3), 
being 1·1 years with medium dependency for both sexes in 
the 2011 cohort, and 1·3 years for men and 1·9 years for 
women with high dependency in the 2011 cohort.

If the proportion of people aged 65 years and older in 
each dependency state remains the same as CFAS II, 
then from 2015, numbers with medium dependency will 
increase by 190 000 by 2025 and a further 272 000 by 
2035, and with similar increases in numbers with high 
dependency of 163 000 by 2025 and a further 237 000 by 
2035 (table 3). Assuming that the proportion of those 
with medium and high dependency who are in care 
homes remains constant, these increases will require a 
further 71 215 care home places by 2025 and 189 043 by 
2035 (table 3).
Discussion
The past 20 years have seen continued gains in life 
expectancy at older ages, but not all have been healthy 
years, with about 2 years more spent with low dependency 
(requiring help less often than daily), but, more 
importantly, about 1 year more with high dependency 
(24-h care). Moreover, fewer older people with substantial 
care needs (medium or high dependency) now reside in 
care homes, although if current numbers stay constant, 
an extra 71 215 care home places will be needed by 2025. 
These findings have considerable implications for older 
people and their families, with the increasing diversity of 
family structures, and for countries struggling to fund 
care for their ageing populations.
Between 1991 and 2011, we found significant increases 
in the likelihood of requiring help for three (60%) of the 
five items defining high dependency, one (50%) of the 
two items defining medium dependency, and four (80%) 
of the five items defining low dependency. It is therefore 
unlikely that our increases in low and high dependency 
are driven by changes in one or two items. Despite 
interval need having a strong correlation with frequency 
of help required,8 the allocation of bathing or washing all 
over into low dependency rather than medium 
dependency could be debated. However, analysis of 
changes in the individual items suggest that moving 
bathing into moderate dependency would result in even 
greater increases in low dependency, and little change or

a slight decrease in medium dependency. Nevertheless, 
the levels of dependency reflected in interval need 
provide a much more transparent indication of intensity 
of care required than simply summing the number of 
activities with which an older person requires help.
Time trends in health expectancies have generally 
focused on self-rated health and disability, often without 
any regard to severity of disability,11,24 although there 
have been studies at a single timepoint reporting health 
expectancy based on interval need.8,17 The USA12 and 
Japan25 saw increases in years spent with milder disability 
and stability in years with severe disability over a similar 
period, in keeping with our earlier findings11 that used a 
more restricted set of activity items. In our present study, 
years with care needs at age 65 years increased by 
1·5 years per decade for men and 1·95 years per decade 
for women, which are substantially more than those 
in Germany between 2001 and 2009 (approximately 
0·28 years per decade for men and 0·47 years per decade 
for women)26 and in Japan between 2005 and 2009 
(0·38 years per decade for men and 0·90 years per decade 
for women).27 However, the German and Japanese studies 
assessed receipt of care from administrative data, which 
might reflect demand and could miss unmet need.
If the increase in years with low dependency continues, 
there will be considerable implications for family and 
friends who provide the majority of care at this level. Many 
older people feel the responsibility for care should be with 
the family rather than with the state, although increasing 
numbers of divorces, more geographically disparate 
families, extended working life, and increases in female 
labour market participation will make such provision 
more difficult in the future, not only in high-income 
countries but worldwide.28 Moreover, in England, local 
authorities have tightened their eligibility criteria for 
publicly funded care and therefore people with low 
dependency are unlikely to qualify for it; those without 
close family members to provide unpaid care and sufficient 
income to purchase care might be left with unmet needs, 
exacerbating inequalities.29 Future longitudinal analysis of 
CFAS will examine the extent to which the increases in 
low dependency have widened inequalities as a result of 
earlier dependency onset in the socially disadvantaged.
The past two decades have seen reductions in the 
overall numbers in care homes but higher prevalence of 
func 
tional and cognitive impairments among residents.30 
Our findings showed that more years were spent with 
high dependency, and that older people with substantial 
depend 
encies are now more likely to live supported in the 
community. If dependency prevalence remains constant, 
we estimate that by 2025 there will be an additional 
353 000 older people with substantial dependencies; they 
will have complex care needs that require sustained input 
from family carers or community health or social care 
teams to support independent living.8 In countries where 
publicly funded social care is means tested, such as 
England, older people with substantial savings or incomes 
will be required to pay for their care privately or rely on 
intensive unpaid care from their family. This level of 
intensity of care provision affects negatively on the carer’s 
health, but also, as the carer is often a child, their ability to 
remain in the workforce.
So what are the implications for health-care services of 
the increases in high and low dependency states in older 
people for the health-care services? The workforce must 
be competent and adequately skilled to care for an ageing 
population.31 For care home residents with complex 
needs, a new specialty—a nursing home physician—has 
been developed in the Netherlands;32 however, high-
quality evidence is unavailable to facilitate wider imple-
mentation of such new innovative service models. For 
older people with low dependency living at home, family 
physicians and their community care teams are the first 
point of contact for care, and they are increasingly under-
taking the majority of chronic illness management.31 In 
the UK, undergraduate training for doctors is inadequate 
to meet current and future population needs, and 
recommendations to extend core training remain as 
recommendations.33
It is at the point of low dependency, or even earlier 
when 
individuals 
are 
first 
encountering 
activity 
limitation, when there is the most chance of slowing 
down decline. Solutions might include building of 
intrinsic capacity through structured exercise or

rehabilitation, or by the provision of appropriate aids and 
adaptations to com 
pensate for loss of capacity, and 
delaying the onset of disabling diseases and conditions.29 
Additional specialist services can therefore be anticipated 
to support the primary care workforce and provide access 
to rehab 
ilitation.31 Evidence confirms that community-
based com 
prehensive geriatric assessment enables more 
older people to remain at home for longer than they 
would without comprehensive geriatric assessment, yet 
such services are not widely implemented,34 and 
community-based clinicians need tools that are evidence 
based and practical to help earlier identification of those 
who would benefit most from such interventions.31
Because CFAS I and CFAS II are large population-
based studies with similar study designs that include 
individuals who live at home, in sheltered accom-
modation, and in all residential care settings, our current 
study provides strong cohort comparisons. However, we 
noted four limitations. Firstly activities defining 
dependency were limited to those collected and were 
mostly assessed through self-report or proxy report, 
although many were interviewer observed. Secondly, 
response to interview was higher in CFAS I than in

CFAS II, although we used inverse probability weighting 
to adjust for non-response biases, and levels of 
dependency have increased. Thirdly, life expectancies 
were based on the cross-sectional population not actual 
observed survival data, although these findings will be 
available in time. Finally, there is little ethnic diversity in 
CFAS I and CFAS II and therefore our results have 
limited generalisability to non-white populations.
A 65-year-old in 2011, compared with their counterpart 
in 1991, spent on average almost a year longer requiring 
24-h care, and a larger proportion received this care at 
home provided by family and friends and formal home-
based services. Early intervention with rehabilitation and 
provision of appropriate assistive technology when low 
dependency is first encountered might ensure that 
fewer remaining years are spent with higher dependency, 
reducing the burden on family and state funding. 
Additionally, interval need is more transparent than the 
usual disability measures, and it fits well within the 
WHO framework for healthy ageing.29 Consensus on 
the items to form the measure in a global context will be 
important to provide a policy-relevant outcome for public 
health interventions and one that can be used by 
individuals and countries planning future care costs.
