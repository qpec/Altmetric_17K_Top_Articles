ABSTRACT
We report a platform that increases the sensitivity of high-throughput
sequencing for detection and characterization of bacteria, virulence determinants,
and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes. The system uses a probe set comprised of
4.2 million oligonucleotides based on the Pathosystems Resource Integration Center
(PATRIC) database, the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD), and
the Virulence Factor Database (VFDB), representing 307 bacterial species that include
all known human-pathogenic species, known antimicrobial resistance genes, and
known virulence factors, respectively. The use of bacterial capture sequencing (Bac-
CapSeq) resulted in an up to 1,000-fold increase in bacterial reads from blood sam-
ples and lowered the limit of detection by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude compared to
conventional unbiased high-throughput sequencing, down to a level comparable to
that of agent-specific real-time PCR with as few as 5 million total reads generated
per sample. It detected not only the presence of AMR genes but also biomarkers for
AMR that included both constitutive and differentially expressed transcripts.
IMPORTANCE BacCapSeq is a method for differential diagnosis of bacterial infec-
tions and defining antimicrobial sensitivity profiles that has the potential to reduce
morbidity and mortality, health care costs, and the inappropriate use of antibiotics
that contributes to the development of antimicrobial resistance.

M
ore than 1.5 million individuals annually develop sepsis in the United States
alone; approximately 250,000 have fatal outcomes (1). Current diagnosis of sepsis
is culture based and may require 48 to 72 h (2, 3). An additional challenge is that some
pathogenic bacteria are fastidious, such as Legionella or Bartonella species, and difficult
to cultivate. Multiplex PCR systems have been established for differential diagnosis of
infection detecting up to 19 pathogenic bacteria (4). However, no platform currently
permits rapid and simultaneous insights into phylogeny, pathogenicity markers, and
antimicrobial resistance (AMR) needed to enable the early and precise antibiotic
treatment that could reduce morbidity, mortality, and economic burden.
The strategy of targeted sequence capture has been employed in the assessment of
the human exome and individual targeted genes (5–7) and for viral discovery, surveil-
lance, and diagnostics (8, 9). Here, we describe a bacterial capture sequence system,

RESULTS
Probe design strategy. We assembled a probe set comprised of 4.2 million
oligonucleotides based on the Pathosystems Resource Integration Center (PATRIC)
database (11), representing 307 bacterial species that include all known human-
pathogenic species. The probe set also represents all known antimicrobial resistance
genes and virulence factors based on sequences in the Comprehensive Antibiotic
Resistance Database (CARD) (12) and Virulence Factor Database (VFDB) (13, 14). Probes
were selected along the coding sequences of the 307 targeted bacteria (see Table S1
in the supplemental material) with an average length of 75 nucleotides (nt) to maintain
a probe melting temperature (Tm) with a mean of 79°
C. The average interval between
probes along annotated protein coding sequences targeted for capture was 121 nt (see
Materials and Methods for further details). The probes capture fragments that include
sequences contiguous to their targets; thus, we recovered near complete protein
coding sequence. An example with Klebsiella pneumoniae is shown in Fig. 1a. Probes
based on the CARD and VFDB databases ensured coverage of AMR genes and virulence

BacCapSeq performance using whole-blood nucleic acid spiked with bacterial
nucleic acid. The efficiency of the bacterial capture sequence (BacCapSeq) system
versus conventional unbiased high-throughput sequencing (UHTS) was assessed in
side-by-side comparisons of data obtained with 5 million reads per sample. We began
with extracts of whole blood spiked with DNA from Bordetella pertussis, Escherichia coli,
Neisseria meningitidis, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi, Streptococcus agalactiae, Strep-
tococcus pneumoniae, V. cholerae, and Campylobacter jejuni at concentrations ranging
from 40 to 40,000 copies/ml. BacCapSeq yielded up to 100-fold more reads and higher
genome coverage for all bacterial targets tested compared to UHTS (Table 1). The
enhanced performance of BacCapSeq was particularly pronounced at lower copy
numbers.
BacCapSeq performance using whole blood spiked with bacterial cells. We
tested performance with whole blood spiked with K. pneumoniae, B. pertussis, N.
meningitidis, S. pneumoniae, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis cells. Nucleic acid was
extracted from the spiked sample and processed for BacCapSeq or UHTS. Here too,
BacCapSeq yielded more reads and higher genome coverage than UHTS (Table 2
and Fig. 2).
BacCapSeq performance using cultured blood samples. We tested the utility of
BacCapSeq in analysis of blood culture samples obtained from the Clinical Microbiology
Laboratory at New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Medical Center.
Patient blood was collected into conventional BacTec blood culture flasks and incu-
bated until flagged as growth positive by the BD BacTec automated blood culture

 BacCapSeq performance with human blood samples. Blood samples from two
immunosuppressed individuals with HIV/AIDS and sepsis of unknown cause were
extracted and processed for BacCapSeq and UHTS analysis in parallel. A causative agent
was identified by either method; however, BacCapSeq yielded higher numbers of
relevant reads and better genome coverage (Fig. 3). Salmonella enterica was detected
in one patient. The other patient had evidence of coinfection with both S. pneumoniae
and Gardnerella vaginalis.
BacCapSeq-facilitated discovery of potential AMR biomarkers. The current
probe set specifically captures all AMR genes present in the CARD database. Demon-
strating the presence of an AMR gene is not equivalent to finding evidence for its
functional expression. To address this challenge, we have begun to use BacCapSeq to

 pursue potential biomarkers in bacteria exposed to antibiotics. We cultured ampicillin-
sensitive and -resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus at an inoculum of 1,000 CFU/ml
in the presence or absence of the antibiotic for 45, 90, and 270 min. We then extracted
RNA for BacCapSeq and UHTS for transcriptomic analysis to find biomarkers that
differentiated ampicillin-sensitive and ampicillin-resistant S. aureus strains exposed to
ampicillin. As illustrated in Fig. 4, BacCapSeq enabled discovery of transcripts that were
differentially expressed between 90 min and 270 min of antibiotic exposure. These
represented constitutive genes that reflect bacterial replication, including classical
strain- and species-specific markers such as 16S and 23S rRNA, elongation factors Tu
(tuf) and G (fusA), protein A (spa), clumping factor B (clfB), or 30S ribosomal protein S12
(rpsL).
DISCUSSION
In the pre-antibiotic era, puerperal sepsis was a common cause of maternal mor-
tality. Up to 30% of children did not survive their first year of life, and community-
acquired pneumonia and meningitis resulted in 30% and 70% mortality, respectively
(15). The advent of bacterial diagnostics and antibiotics has not only reduced the
burden of naturally occurring infectious diseases, but has also enhanced our quality of
life by enabling innovations in clinical medicine such as organ transplantation, joint
replacement, and other invasive surgical procedures, immunosuppressive chemother-
apy, and burn management (16). These advances are threatened by the emergence of

culture for 45, 90, and 270 min in the presence of ampicillin. Box plots represent the log of normalized transcript
counts for each gene. Only results obtained with BacCapSeq are shown because no transcripts were detected in
the presence of ampicillin with UHTS until later time points.

 AMR. In 2013, the collaborative World Economic Forum estimated 100,000 annual
AMR-related deaths in the United States alone due to hospital-acquired infections (17).
The global impact of AMR is estimated at 700,000 deaths annually, with the highest
burden in the developing world. The financial implications are also dire. The CDC
estimates the direct annual impact of antibiotic resistance in the United States is 20 to
35 billion U.S. dollars (USD), with an additional 35 billion USD in lost productivity (18).
Absent an effective response to limit further growth in AMR, the challenge will continue
to increase. The World Bank issued a report in March 2017 citing the impact of AMR on
the gross domestic product (GDP) by 2030 will be between 1.1 trillion and 3.4 trillion
USD (19).
Early, accurate differential diagnosis of bacterial infections is critical to reducing
morbidity, mortality, and health care costs. It can also enhance antibiotic stewardship
by reducing the inappropriate use of antibiotics. Multiplex PCR methods in common
use for differential diagnosis of bacterial infections can identify potential pathogens but
do not provide insights into the presence or expression of AMR genes. Furthermore,
they do not include bacteria only rarely associated with significant disease, such as
G. vaginalis, implicated here in unexplained sepsis in an individual with HIV/AIDS.
Culture-based methods require 2 to several days to identify pathogens and even longer
to provide antibiotic susceptibility profiles (20, 21). Accordingly, physicians typically
administer broad-spectrum antibiotics pending acquisition of more specific information
(22).
We have not subjected BacCapSeq to rigorous validation using methods for deter-
mining limits of detection and reproducibility required for approval of a diagnostic
assay in clinical microbiology. Nonetheless, results obtained with blood samples spiked
with known concentrations of bacterial DNA (Table 1 and Fig. 1) or bacterial cells
(Table 2 and Fig. 2) demonstrated a dose-dependent, consistent enhancement in the
number of reads recovered and genome coverage obtained with BacCapSeq versus
UHTS. In instances where the bacterial load was as low as 40 cells per ml, UHTS
detected no sequences of M. tuberculosis, K. pneumoniae, N. meningitidis, or S. pneu-
moniae and only one read for B. pertussis. In each of these instances, BacCapSeq
detected multiple reads (M. tuberculosis, 6; K. pneumoniae, 522; N. meningitidis, 151; S.
pneumoniae, 4; B. pertussis, 269) (Table 2). This advantage was also observed in analysis
of blood from patients with unexplained sepsis (Fig. 3), where reads obtained were
higher with BacCapSeq than UHTS for S. enterica (3,183 versus 132), S. pneumoniae
(419,070 versus 130), and G. vaginalis (776,113 versus 2,080). These findings suggest
that where levels of bacteria in blood are below 40 cells per ml, BacCapSeq has the
potential to indicate the presence of a causal pathogen that might be missed by UHTS.
Incubation periods in blood culture systems commonly range from 3 days to 5 days
(23–25). Longer intervals may be required for sensitive detection of some pathogenic
species of Neisseria, Rickettsia, Mycobacterium, Leptospira, Ehrlichia, Coxiella, Campylo-
bacter, Burkholderia, Brucella, Bordetella, and Bartonella. An additional challenge is that
bacterial loads may be low or intermittent. Cockerill et al. (24) and Lee et al. (26) have
suggested that 80 ml of blood in four separate collections of at least 20 ml of blood are
required for 99% test sensitivity in detecting viable bacteria. We have not performed
head-to-head comparisons of either BacCapSeq or UHTS with culture. We also cannot
address the issue of intermittent bacteremia but are nonetheless encouraged by the
observation that current estimates of BacCapSeq sensitivity (a minimum of 40 copies
per ml) correspond favorably to the 80 ml sample volume recommended in culture
tests (26). The American Society for Microbiology and the Clinical and Laboratory
Standards Institute (CLSI) require false-positivity rates below 3% (27, 28). Protocols for
hygiene in diagnostic microbiology will be even more stringent with BacCapSeq than
culture because nucleic acids are not eliminated by common disinfectants. To limit
potential false-positive calls based on spurious read signals, we propose a conservative
threshold cutoff for bona fide signal of 10 reads per million reads. However, the
presence of fewer reads specific for the particular strain or isolate should trigger a

 search for confirmation or refutation using alternative methods, such as specific PCR
assays based on findings with BacCapSeq or UHTS.
BacCapSeq is designed to detect all AMR genes in the CARD database. Where these
genes are located on bacterial chromosomes, we anticipate that flanking sequences will
allow association with specific bacteria within a sample, even when those samples
contain more than one bacterial species. Where AMR genes are extrachromosomal, we
may not be able to do so. However, BacCapSeq is anticipated to enable the discovery
of constitutively expressed and induced transcripts that reflect the presence of func-
tional bacterium-specific AMR elements.
Our objective in building BacCapSeq was to enable efficient and sensitive detection
of pathogenic bacteria, virulence factors, and antimicrobial resistance genes. As with
VirCapSeq-VERT, the analogous sequence capture platform established for viral diag-
nostics and surveillance, BacCapSeq is anticipated to allow focused investment of
sequencing capacity. This should facilitate multiplexing and decreases in sequencing
costs and in the complexity of bioinformatic analysis.
We acknowledge that the system has several constraints. The method is sensitive to
as few as 40 to 400 copies/ml. However, BacCapSeq is qualitative, not quantitative.
Where measurements of bacterial burden are critical, BacCapSeq findings should be
followed by quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays. Such assays would add an additional 3 h
to processing time. The system can only detect bacterial sequences that are sufficiently
similar to probes for efficient capture. In earlier work, based on probes with similar
lengths and probe melting temperature (Tm) properties, we defined a homology
threshold for capture of 60% nucleotide identity (10). Accordingly, a novel bacterium
that differs from any known human pathogen by more than 40% over the entire length
of its coding sequence would not be detected. At present, the time from sample
acquisition to results using the Illumina platform is approximately 70 h. This is not a
time frame that will have a major impact on clinical diagnostics. However, the probe set
is platform agnostic and should be adaptable to nanopore and anticipated more rapid
sequencing systems that would have broader utility in clinical microbiology laborato-
ries and resource-challenged environments, such as those found in the developing
world. Bacterial typing and AMR biomarker discoveries enabled by BacCapSeq could
also be used to establish qPCR assays that produce results within hours of clinical
sample receipt.

29213 were acquired from the American Type Culture Collection.
Nucleic acid extraction. Total nucleic acid from bacterial cells, whole blood spiked with bacteria, or
bacterial nucleic acids were extracted using an Allprep mini DNA/RNA kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and
quantitated by NanoDrop One (Wilmington, DE) or Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). Bacterial
nucleic acid and genome equivalents were quantitated by agent-specific quantitative TaqMan real-time
PCR.
Agent-specific quantitative TaqMan real-time PCR and standards. Primers and probes for quan-
titative PCR (qPCR) were selected in conserved single-copy genes of the investigated bacterial species
with Geneious v10.2.3 (https://www.geneious.com) (Table S3). Standards for quantitation were gener-
ated by cloning a fragment of the targeted gene spanning the primers into pGEM-T Easy vector
(Promega, Madison, WI). Recombinant plasmid DNA was purified using a Mini Plasmid Prep kit (Qiagen).
The linearized plasmid DNA concentration was determined using NanoDrop One, and copy numbers
were adjusted by dilution in Tris-HCl (pH 8) with 1 ng/ml salmon sperm DNA.
Probe design. Our objective was to target all known human bacterial pathogens as well as any
known antimicrobial resistance genes and virulence factors. Known human-pathogenic bacteria were
selected from the available bacterial genomes in the PATRIC database (11). Included were all species for
which at least one strain or isolate is annotated as “human-related”and “pathogenic.”One genome was
selected per species due to probe number limitations. In consultation with experts in the field, we added
other bacterial species that were considered to have high potential to become pathogenic. The final list

 contained 307 species (Table S1), including all 19 bacterial species listed in the priority list from the Child
Health and Mortality Prevention program of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
The protein coding sequences from the selected genomes of the 307 species were extracted and
combined with the full data set of 2,169 antimicrobial resistance gene sequences in the CARD database
(12) and the 30,178 virulence factor genes in the VFDB database (13, 14). All databases were downloaded
in March 2017. The combined target sequence data set (1,196,156 genes) was clustered at 96% sequence
identity (resulting in 1,007,426 genes) and sent to the bioinformatics core of Roche Sequencing Solutions
(Madison, WI), where sequences were subjected to further filtration based on printing considerations.
Probe lengths were refined by adjusting their start/stop positions to constrain the melting temperature.
The final library comprised 4,220,566 oligonucleotides with an average length of 75 nt. The average
interprobe distance between probes along the targeted bacterial proteome, virulence, and AMR targets
was 121 nt.
Unbiased high-throughput sequencing. Double-stranded DNA (for detection of bacteria) or cDNA
(for detection of transcripts) was sheared to an average fragment size of 200 bp (E210 focused ultra-
sonicator; Covaris, Woburn, MA). Sheared products were purified using AxyPrep Mag PCR cleanup beads
(Axygen/Corning, Corning, NY), and libraries were constructed using KAPA library preparation kits
(Wilmington, MA) with input quantities of 10 to 100 ng DNA. Libraries were purified (AxyPrep), quanti-
tated by Bioanalyzer (Agilent), and then split, with one half processed by BacCapSeq (see below) and the
other directly sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq platform v3, with 150 cycles (San Diego, CA).
Bacterial capture sequencing. Nucleic acid preparation, shearing, and library construction were the
same as for UHTS, except for the use of SeqCap EZ indexed adapter kits (Roche Sequencing Solutions,
Pleasanton, CA) (BacCapSeq). The quality and quantity of libraries were checked using a Bioanalyzer
(Agilent). Libraries were mixed with a SeqCap HE universal oligonucleotide, SeqCap HE index blocking
oligonucleotides, and COT DNA and vacuum evaporated at 60°
C. Dried samples were mixed with
hybridization buffer and hybridization component A (Roche) prior to denaturation at 95°
C for 10 min. The
BacCapSeq probe library (SeqCap EZ Designs, v4.0; Roche) was added and hybridized at 47°
C for 12 h in
a standard PCR thermocycler. SeqCap Pure capture beads (Roche) were washed twice, mixed with the
hybridization mixture, and kept at 47°
C for 45 min with vortexing for 10 s every 10 to 15 min. The
streptavidin capture beads complexed with biotinylated BacCapSeq probes were trapped (DynaMag-2
magnet; Thermo Fisher) and washed once at 47°
C and then twice more at room temperature with wash
buffers of increasing stringency. Finally, beads were suspended in 50 �l water and directly subjected to
posthybridization PCR (SeqCap EZ accessory kit V2; Roche). The PCR products were purified (Agencourt
Ampure DNA purification beads; Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA) prior to sequencing on an Illumina MiSeq
platform v3. The time required for extraction, library construction, hybridization, generation of 150 bp
single reads, and bioinformatic analysis is approximately 70 h.
Data analysis and bioinformatics pipeline. Each sample yielded an average of 5 million 100 bp
single-end reads. The demultiplexed FastQ files were adapter trimmed using Cutadapt v1.13 (29).
Adapter trimming was followed by generation of quality reports using FastQC v0.11.5 (https://www
.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) and filtering with PRINSEQ v 0.20.3 (30). Host back-
ground levels were determined by mapping the filtered reads against the human genome using Bowtie2
v2.0.6 (31). The host-subtracted reads were de novo assembled using Megahit v1.0.4-beta (32); contigs
and unique singletons were subjected to homology search using MegaBlast against the GenBank
nucleotide database (33). The genomes of the tested bacteria were mapped with Bowtie2 using the
filtered data set to visualize the depth and the genome recovery in IGV (34, 35). Results of spiking
experiments are presented without any cutoff. Results of clinical blood culture and AMR treatment
analyses are presented using an empirical cutoff. Targets with read counts above a 0.001% cutoff (�10
reads/1 million quality- and host-filtered reads) were rated positive.
For transcriptional analyses, MiSeq reads were aligned using the STAR read mapping package (36).
Expression data were extracted from each sample using featureCounts (37), and the results were
compiled into a master data file representing transcript counts for each gene. These data were
normalized based on the number of reads sequenced for each sample, and the data were sorted by strain
(AMR�/AMR�), time point, and antibiotic treatment to identify genes with differences in growth patterns
based on these metrics.
