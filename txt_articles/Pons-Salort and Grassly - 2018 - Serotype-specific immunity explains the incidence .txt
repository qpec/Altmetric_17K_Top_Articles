Serotype-specific immunity explains
the incidence of diseases caused
by human enteroviruses
Margarita Pons-Salort* and Nicholas C. Grassly
Human enteroviruses are a major cause of neurological and other diseases. More
than 100 serotypes are known that exhibit unexplained complex patterns of
incidence, from regular cycles to more irregular patterns, and new emergences.
Using 15 years of surveillance data from Japan (2000–2014) and a stochastic
transmission model with accurate demography, we show that acquired serotype-
specific immunity can explain the diverse patterns of 18 of the 20 most common
serotypes (including Coxsackieviruses, Echoviruses, and Enterovirus-A71). The
remaining two serotypes required a change in viral characteristics, including an
increase in pathogenicity for Coxsackievirus-A6, which is consistent with its recent
global rise in incidence. On the basis of our findings, we are able to predict outbreaks
2 years ahead of time (2015–2016). These results have implications for the impact of
vaccines under development.
M
ore than 100 enterovirus serotypes infect
humans and can cause a wide range of
diseases,includingmeningitis,encephalitis,
paralysis, myocarditis, haemorrhagic con-
junctivitis, upper respiratory infections,
herpangina, and hand-foot-and-mouth disease
(HFMD) (1). This group contains the Coxsackie-
viruses A (CV-A) and B (CV-B), the Echoviruses
(E), and other serotypes simply called Enterovirus
(EV), as well as the three poliovirus serotypes,
which are the target of a global eradication pro-
gram. The epidemiology of enteroviruses is char-
acterized by frequent asymptomatic infections
and a peak of disease in summer. Despite the
well-defined annual seasonality of enterovirus-
associated diseases, individual serotypes show
different long-term patterns of circulation, from
regular annual or multiannual cycles to more ir-
regular patterns. For example, enterovirus A71
(EV-A71) has a 3-year cycle in Malaysia (2) and
Japan but a 1-year cycle in China (3). Some sero-
types also sporadically emerge as substantial
causes of diseases. For example, CV-A6 has
emerged during recent years as the main cause
of HFMD worldwide (4), and EV-D68 emerged
in 2014 in the United States as an important cause
of severe respiratory illnesses (5). The increased
incidence of HFMD in Southeast Asia during the
past two decades [with >1 million cases reported
in China annually (3)], the large proportion of
viral meningitis attributed to nonpolio enter-
oviruses [>75% (6)] and the sporadic emergence
of new serotypes attest to their clinical and pub-
lic health importance.
A fundamental challenge for research on enter-
oviruses and other endemic and antigenically
diverse pathogens (such as rotavirus, influenza,
pneumococcus, and dengue), is to understand
what causes the changes in incidence over time
of different serotypes. This has direct implica-
tions for the prediction of future outbreaks of
disease and the impact of serotype-specific vac-
cines, such as licensed monovalent EV-A71 vac-
cines (7) and other single- and multivalent vaccines
under development (8). There is currently no
accepted mechanistic explanation for the com-
plex long-term patterns of circulation of enter-
ovirus serotypes, including why different serotypes
predominate in different years. Homotypic (serotype-
specific) population immunity, heterotypic (cross-
serotype) immunity, and virus evolution (including
antigenic drift and recombination) could all
contribute.
In most countries, enterovirus surveillance is
passive and thus mainly captures the serotypes
isolated from severe cases suspected of having an
enterovirus infection (such as neonatal infections
and clusters of aseptic meningitis, encephalitis,
or paralysis). Serotypes isolated from mild dis-
eases are rarely reported. Furthermore, variation
in clinical testing and participation of laboratories
results in irregular reporting rates over time. In
contrast with most countries, Japan has a na-
tional disease sentinel–based surveillance system
that isolates and identifies enteroviruses from
patients attending sentinel sites for four target
diseases representative of enterovirus infections:
aseptic meningitis (mostly caused by Echoviruses,
CV-Bs, and CV-A9), HFMD (mostly caused by
EV-A71 and CV-A6, -10, and -16), herpangina
(mostly caused by CV-As), and acute haemorrhagic
conjunctivitis (mostly caused by a variant of
CV-A24 and EV-D70) (9). Enterovirus surveillance
in Japan therefore captures the circulation of a
broad range of serotypes and does it in a con-
sistent and systematic way. We used time-series
analysis and mathematical modeling of the high-
quality surveillance data from Japan collected
between 2000 and 2016 to identify mechanisms
that can explain the transmission dynamics of
enterovirus serotypes.

 Nonpolio enteroviruses show strong seasonality
in Japan, with aggregate case numbers showing
a peak every summer between January 2000 and
December 2014 (Fig. 1A). The incidence of sero-
types with >500 isolations during that period
(total numbers are provided in table S1) ex-
hibited diverse patterns (Fig. 2, red line, and
figs. S4 to S6), including serotypes with regular
cycles of 1 year (such as CV-B4), 2 years (such as
CV-A4), 3 years (such as EV-A71), and 4 years
(such as CV-B3), and less regular patterns (such
as E25). A wavelet analysis (supplementary text
S1.3) identified these periodicities and their
changes over time—that is, regime shifts (figs. S7
to S9). In particular, we observed that CV-A4
switched from a 1-year cycle between 2000 and
2004 to a 2-year cycle from 2004 onward (Fig. 1,
B and D). We hypothesized that if CV-A4 behaved
as a highly immunizing infection, this temporal
pattern could be explained by the general de-
crease in births that Japan has experienced during
the past two decades (Fig. 1C). In this case, only
births would replenish the susceptible pool and
consequently determine the chances that an out-
break occurs (10). Similar but perhaps less obvious
signatures in the pattern of other serotypes also
indicated this mechanism (such as CV-A9 and
CV-A16).
To test this hypothesis, we constructed a sim-
ple stochastic transmission model that assumed
acquired and lifelong homotypic immunity and
that included a seasonal transmission rate, asymp-
tomatic infections, underreporting, and realistic
birth and death rates (supplementary text S1.4
and S1.5). Using a maximum-likelihood infer-
ence framework based on particle filtering (11),
we fitted the model to the number of detections
reported each month between January 2000 and
December 2014 for each of the 20 most prevalent

Downloaded from 
 serotypes with more than one peak of activity.
These included seven Coxsackieviruses A, five
Coxsackieviruses B, seven Echoviruses, and EV-
A71. We then assessed whether the maximum
likelihood model was able to predict the 15-year
incidence pattern of each serotype when simu-
lating forward from the initial conditions, only
varying birth and death rates as observed in
Japan. Because demographic stochasticity re-
sults in variability between simulated realizations
with the same parameter values, we simulated
100 stochastic realizations with the maximum-
likelihood estimates (MLEs) of the parameters
and show here the 10 that most closely match
the observed epidemic trajectories (supplemen-
tary text S2.3). Model failure to reproduce the
observed dynamics of specific serotypes guided
us to generate hypotheses of extra mechanisms
that could explain the observed incidence.
The model fitted the 15 years of incidence
data remarkably well for 18 of the 20 serotypes
examined—all except CV-A6 and E18 (Fig. 2).
These included serotypes with periods of 2 years
(such as CV-A2 and CV-A4), 3 years (such as
CV-A9 and EV-A71), and even longer (such as E3).
The model was also able to capture more irregular
dynamics, such as those exhibited by E6 and E25,
that showed a few years of activity followed by
several consecutive years with barely any cases.
Underestimation of the largest peaks of cases
for a few serotypes could be due to undocumented
enhanced sample collection and surveillance ef-
forts during large outbreaks (such as 2010 for
EV-A71). The model also predicted a few small
peaks that were not observed in the data (such as
2003 for CV-A5, 2013 for CV-A10, 2005 for CV-B1,
2009–2010 for CV-B5, and 2009–2012 for E30).
Possibly, these discrepancies reflect gaps in sur-
veillance resulting from the distribution of sen-
tinel sites and spatial clustering of cases or,
alternatively, could correspond to local viral
extinctions that are not captured by the model.
The number of estimated susceptible individ-
uals (Fig. 2, blue line) shows how births pro-
gressively increase population susceptibility after
each peak of cases, until a threshold is reached
and a new outbreak occurs. With decreasing
births, it takes longer for this threshold to be
reached, increasing the chances of transition to
longer cycles (such as CV-A4 from 2004 onwards,
CV-A9 from 2006, and CV-A16 from 2008), which
sometimes result in a bigger outbreak.
Although the model did not explain the dy-
namics of CV-A6 and E18 over the entire 15-year
period, it fit the data well until the dynamics
suddenly changed (2011 and 2006, respectively),
suggesting that mechanisms other than homo-
typic immunity contributed to these dynamics
(Fig. 2, D and R). Virus evolution in antigenic
or other regions could perhaps explain these
patterns. For example, it has been suggested
that diversity in capsid structures of some Echo-
viruses could have generated different antigenic
variants (12), or that recombination in the non-
structural proteins could provide a fitness or
immunological advantage (13). To test whether a
sudden change in transmissibility, pathogenicity,
or antigenicity alone could explain the pattern of
CV-A6 and E18, we fitted three model extensions
accounting for those changes (supplementary
text S1.6). For CV-A6, we estimated that a fivefold
increase in pathogenicity in 2010 provided a
better fit to the data than models with a change
in transmissibility or antigenicity (Fig. 3A). This
is consistent with the recent global emergence of
this serotype as the main cause of HFMD with
atypical symptoms (4) and a change around 2009
in the disease that it caused in Japan (mostly
herpangina before, but HFMD since then) (14).
For E18, however, either an antigenic change or
an increase in transmissibility at the end of 2005
(but not a change in pathogenicity) provided a
better fit to the data (Fig. 3, B and C).
Parameter estimates revealed interesting dif-
ferences in transmissibility among the serotypes
(fig. S55 and table S3). Those associated with
HFMD and herpangina (most CV-As and EV-A71)
had generally higher estimates of the average basic
reproduction number compared with those asso-
ciated with aseptic meningitis (CV-A9, CV-Bs, and
Echoviruses). This may reflect higher transmission
efficiency of serotypes mainly affecting children
and/or differences in transmission routes (fecal-
oral versus respiratory). The estimated reporting
probability per infection was between 10−5 and
10−4, which is about two orders of magnitude
smaller than the probability of paralysis after
poliovirus infection (10−3 to 10−2) (15). This may
reflect differences in pathogenicity and coverage
of the sentinel surveillance system.
Our results have implications for outbreak
preparedness. By extending model simulations
2 years beyond the data used for parameter es-
timation (2015–2016), the magnitude of the epi-
demics was predicted with reasonable accuracy
for most of the serotypes (Figs. 2 and 3, orange
backgrounds, and fig. S56). The accuracy of these
forecasts was similar to that obtained when sim-
ulating forward from 2015 only, by using the
reconstructed state space variables obtained from
the particle-filter (fig. S57). Inaccurate forecasts
for a few serotypes could be due to changes in
viral properties during the prediction period, local
viral extinctions, or inaccurate projections of fu-
ture number of births. Nevertheless, our simple
model could help anticipate years with a large
number of cases of a given serotype. These fore-
casts could be improved by incorporating data
on serotype-specific population immunity from
seroprevalence surveys.
Similarly, our model could also be used to pre-
dict the impact of vaccines under development.
For example, we simulated the effect of vaccinat-
ing newborns against EV-A71 and CV-A16 from
2008 onward with a 100% effective vaccine at dif-
ferent coverage levels (fig. S58). For both sero-
types, a coverage of 80% resulted in almost no
cases from 2 years after the introduction of the
vaccine, but lower coverage led to continued in-
cidence, with altered dynamics and occasionally
large outbreaks comparable with those observed
prevaccination.
Our analysis has some limitations. First, we
assumed that acquired homotypic immunity
against infection is complete and lifelong. How-
ever, it is likely to be incomplete and wane over
time for nonpolio enteroviruses, as seen for in-
testinal immunity to polioviruses (16, 17). Extend-
ing our model to include waning immunity
(supplementary text S1.7) resulted in a similarly
good fit to the data (figs. S62 and S63) and an
estimated mean duration of protective immunity
that ranged from 8 years to lifelong (table S5).
This relatively long-lasting immunity meant that
the dynamics were still determined by births, but
estimates of the reproduction number were gen-
erally lower because infection could be sustained
at lower transmission efficiency. Second, we ig-
nored spatial, social, and demographic structure
of the transmission dynamics. Although these
simplifications may have affected some of our
parameter estimates, they do not affect our main
result of the importance of homotypic immunity.
Third, although stochastic extinction of a sero-
type and subsequent reintroduction can occur in
our model, it is inherently difficult to predict
specific periods when infection may be absent.
Last, smaller changes in pathogenicity, trans-
missibility, or antigenicity may have occurred
for serotypes other than CV-A6 and E18 but
not led to a strong signature in the incidence
dynamics.
Although there is evidence that different
enterovirus serotypes share some T cell and B
cell epitopes (18, 19), cross-reactive antibodies

 are not strongly neutralizing, and their potential
epidemiological implications remain elusive. Our
model can explain the temporal dynamics of all
the serotypes we examined without the com-
plexity of adding cross-serotype interactions,
thus providing evidence that homotypic immunity
is the most important driver of the transmission
dynamics of enterovirus serotypes. These findings
support current development efforts of serotype-
specific mono- and multivalent vaccines because
they point against serotype replacement induced
by vaccination. However, two of the serotypes we
examined showed dynamics that are consistent
with a change in viral properties (pathogenicity,
antigenicity, or transmissibility) and emergence
as an important cause of disease. A better under-
standing of this process would support the
appropriate choice of serotypes in multivalent
vaccines that target diseases such as HFMD.
