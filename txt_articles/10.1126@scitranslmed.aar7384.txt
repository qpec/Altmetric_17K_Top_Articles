Chronic pain is a widespread debilitating condition affecting millions of people worldwide. Although several pharma-
cological treatments for relieving chronic pain have been developed, they require frequent chronic administration and
are often associated with severe adverse events, including overdose and addiction. Persistent increased sensitization
of neuronal subpopulations of the peripheral and central nervous system has been recognized as a central mechanism
mediating chronic pain, suggesting that inhibition of specific neuronal subpopulations might produce antinociceptive
effects. We leveraged the neurotoxic properties of the botulinum toxin to specifically silence key pain-processing neu-
rons in the spinal cords of mice. We show that a single intrathecal injection of botulinum toxin conjugates produced
long-lasting pain relief in mouse models of inflammatory and neuropathic pain without toxic side effects. Our results
suggest that this strategy might be a safe and effective approach for relieving chronic pain while avoiding the adverse
events associated with repeated chronic drug administration.
INTRODUCTION
Noxious stimuli of sufficient intensity to induce tissue damage lead to
increased excitability of peripheral and central neuronal circuits that
heightens pain experience and serves to protect damaged tissue from
further trauma (1–4). In some cases, ongoing disease or the failure of
potentiated pain signaling networks to return to preinjury levels leads
to persistent or chronic pain conditions (5). Persistent pain is highly
prevalent and extremely difficult to treat (6, 7) with widely prescribed
drugs such as opioids having significant unwanted side effects (7–9). Al-
though research into developing new analgesic drug therapies has been
intense, translating knowledge from preclinical observations in animal
models to new therapies in the clinic has been challenging (6). Research
into the control of chronic pain states has, however, identified pathways
connecting the spinal cord and brain that are keys to the regulation of
on-going pain states (10–13). Pioneering studies in rats and companion
dogs (11, 14) showed that persistent pain states can be ameliorated by
using a saporin–substance P (SP) conjugate to ablate a small population
of spinal SP receptor [neurokinin-1 receptor (NK1R)] expressing pro-
jection neurons that convey pain-related information to the brain. To
circumvent of the problem of killing spinal neurons with saporin, we
designed botulinum conjugates that were safe to construct, nontoxic,
and acted relatively quickly after intrathecal injection to silence pain-
processing neurons in the spinal cord (15, 16).
Botulinum neurotoxin serotype A (BoNT/A) is made up of a light-
chain zinc endopeptidase and a heavy chain that is responsible for
binding the toxin to neuronal receptors and promoting essential light-
chain translocation across the endosomal membrane (17). Once interna-
lizedwithin the neuron, the light chain hasthe capacity to silence neurons
for several months via the specific proteolytic cleavage of synaptosomal-
associated protein 25 (SNAP25), a protein essential for synaptic release
(15, 16, 18). This inhibition is slowly reversed as the endopeptidase
loses activity (17). Cleaved SNAP25 (cSNAP25) is found in neurons
but not in glial cells and is the unique substrate for botulinum protease
cleavage (19, 20). We exploited a recently introduced “protein stapling”
method (15, 18) using SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide–sensitive
factor attachment protein receptor complex) proteins to link the
light-chain/translocation domain (LcTd) of botulinum neurotoxin type
A (BOT) to neurotransmitter ligands SP and dermorphin that target
pain-processing neurons in the dorsal horn. To silence NK1R-
expressing neurons, we used an SP-botulinum (SP-BOT) construct pre-
viously developed (15), whereas mu opiate receptor (MOR)–expressing
neurons were silenced using a dermorphin-botulinum (Derm-BOT)
construct. We found that the new constructs were selectively internal-
ized after binding to their target receptors, silenced neurons, and
produced a long-term amelioration of pain states.
RESULTS
SP-BOT conjugate induces long-term reduction of
inflammatory and neuropathic pain sensitivity in mice
To silence NK1R-expressing neurons, we used an SP-BOT construct
previously developed (15). SP-BOT (fig. S1) was injected intrathecally
over the lumbar spinal cord of adult C57BL6/J male mice. Hind paw
mechanical withdrawal thresholds measured with von Frey filaments
were used as an indicator of analgesia. The intrathecal injection of
SP-BOT had no effect on baseline mechanical threshold in naïve mice
tested more than 7 days (Fig. 1A) and produced no signs of motor im-
pairmentassessedbyplantarspreadingorrotarodperformance (Fig.1B).
However, in two models of inflammatory pain induced by ankle or hind
paw injection of complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA), intrathecal injection
of SP-BOT 2 days after CFA (when mice showed increased pain sensi-
tivity) produced a substantial reduction in mechanical hypersensitivity
that accompanied inflammation (Fig. 1, C and D). One single intrathecal
injection was effective in reducing pain sensitivity for the duration of the
experiment (21 days for the ankle model and 12 days for the hind paw
model). As internal control, in the hind paw model, we showed that
threshold of mechanical allodynia in the contralateral paw was un-
changed (fig. S2A). Dose-response experiments in animals that received
an ankle injection of CFA showed that maximal reduction of pain sen-
sitivity was obtained with intrathecal injection of 100 ng of SP-BOT
(fig. S3A). Intrathecal injections of the unconjugated BOT without a

 receptor-binding domain (LcTd) had no effect on mechanical hyper-
sensitivity after injection of CFA in the ankle (fig. S4).
We next investigated the effect of SP-BOT on neuropathic pain by
testing the mechanical sensitivity in the unilateral (left) spared nerve
injury (SNI) model of neuropathic pain (pain that is derived from
peripheral nerve damage). The lesion induced hypersensitivity in
the lateral area of the paw on the left side, which is innervated by
the spared sural nerve. SP-BOT was injected intrathecally when the
mechanical hypersensitivity was fully developed and we observed a
reduction in mechanical hypersensitivity that began around 3 days
after SP-BOT injection and lasted for the duration of the experiment
(22 days; Fig. 1E). Mechanical thresholds for the contralateral paw
(right) were unchanged (fig. S2B). To confirm the essential role of NK1R
in mediating the effects of SP-BOT–induced reduction of mechanical
pain sensitivity, we used NK1R knockout (KO) (NK1R−/−) mice (21).
Neuropathic mechanical hypersensitivity was similar in NK1R−/− and
wild-type (WT) littermates after SNI. Intrathecal injection of SP-BOT
was effective in alleviating mechanical hypersensitivity only in WT
animals, whereas in NK1R−/− mice, mechanical allodynia was not
affected by SP-BOT injection (Fig. 1F). The results indicate that the
NK1R is essential for SP-BOT–mediated reduction of mechanical pain
hypersensitivity.
SP-BOT is internalized only by NK1R-expressing neurons but
does not cause cell death
The specificity of the targeted toxin was investigated by examining
the distribution of cSNAP25 by immunohistochemistry in spinal
cord tissue sections using an antibody specific for cSNAP25 (22).
Tissue was taken from CFA-treated mice that had received intra-
thecal injections of SP-BOT, CFA-treated animals that received in-
trathecal saline injection, and naïve animals (n = 4 per group).
Double-fluorescent immunohistochemistry for cSNAP25 and NK1R
indicated that the SP-BOT construct was expressed in cell bodies and
axonal and dendritic branches of NK1R-positive neurons (Fig. 2, A and
B). Cell bodies were first seen 96 hours after intrathecal injection of
the construct, and the numbers and distribution of labeled cell bodies
within the superficial dorsal horn remained unchanged for the dura-
tion of the experiment and were unaffected by peripheral treatment
(fig. S5). Analysis of the parabrachial nucleus of the hindbrain—the

 (23, 24)—revealed cSNAP25-positive putative axons in all mice injected
14 days previously with intrathecal SP-BOT but not in saline-injected
controls (Fig. 2C). Because NK1R is not found in axons (25), the results
suggest that there had been axonal transport of cSNAP25 and/or botuli-
num protease after uptake of the SP-BOT conjugate by spinal NK1R-
positive dendrites and cell bodies. Immunohistochemistry measuring
c-Fos expression, a marker of cell activity (26), showed that in CFA-
injectedmice, the activity of neuronshadbeenreducedin the parabrachial
area of mice that had received an intrathecal injection of SP-BOT 3 days
previously, suggesting that SP-BOT successfully silenced spinal NK1R+
cells (Fig. 2D). In naïve mice, there was no evidence of microglial or astro-
cytic activation after SP-BOT treatment (fig. S6). In addition, no changes
in the extent of NK1R-positive immunofluorescence were found in the
dorsal horn of mice that had been treated with SP-BOT, suggesting lack
of construct-induced cytotoxicity or receptor down-regulation (Fig. 2E).
Derm-BOT conjugate alleviates long-term pain states
Opioids such as morphine are effective in relieving chronic pain. Their
analgesic properties are mostly mediated by the MOR (27). In the dorsal
horn, MOR is expressed by interneurons and some primary afferents and
by some projection neurons(28–30). To test the possibility that inhibiting
MOR-expressing neurons could promote analgesic effects, we conjugated
the botulinum toxin to the MOR agonist dermorphin (Derm-BOT)
(31,32)andcomparedtheanalgesicefficacyofDerm-BOTwithmorphine.
Derm-BOT has been injected intrathecally at the optimal dose of
100 ng/3 ml in naïve mice, and in mice previously injected with CFA in
the ankle joint or in the hind paw after increased mechanical, hyper-
sensitivity was established. Derm-BOT injection did not affect mechanical
pain sensitivity in naïve control mice (Fig. 3A); in contrast, we observed a
reduction in the mechanical hypersensitivity that lasted until the end of
the experiments (up to 18 days) in both models of inflammatory pain
(Fig. 3, B and C). Furthermore, when Derm-BOT was injected after
SP-BOT, the reduction in pain sensitivity induced by SP-BOT was not
further augmented (Fig. 3D). We then investigated the effect of Derm-
BOT on the hypersensitivity that develops after SNI surgery and found
that asingle intrathecalinjection of the construct alleviated the mechanical
hypersensitivity for the duration of the experiment (23 days; Fig. 3E).
Derm-BOT conjugate was internalized by
MOR-positive neurons and did not induce toxicity
Immunohistochemical analysis of spinal cord sections from Derm-
BOT–injected mice showed that all cSNAP25-positive cell bodies and
many neuronal processes throughout the dorsal horn were stained with
MOR antibody (Fig. 4, A and B) but there was no labeling of axons in
the dorsal roots. Cell bodies were first seen 96 hours after intrathecal
injection of the construct, and the numbers and distribution of cSNAP25-
labeled cell bodies remained unchanged for the duration of the ex-
periment (fig. S5). These results indicated that cSNAP25-positive cell
bodies and fibers were likely to be MOR-positive local neurons (Fig. 4,
A and B) and that MOR-positive primary afferents did not internalize
the construct. We also failed to find evidence for glial activation in
naïve mice treated with Derm-BOT (fig. S6). As with SP-BOT, no in-
dication of toxicity was found after Derm-BOT injection (fig. S7).
Derm-BOT conjugates replicate the analgesic actions
of morphine
Finally, we compared the effects on mechanical pain sensitivity of
Derm-BOT with morphine (5 nmol) (33) in the SNI mouse model. In-
trathecal Derm-BOT reduced mechanical sensitivity in SNI mice to the
same extent as intrathecal morphine, and no additive effects were seen
when morphine was injected intrathecally into mice pretreated with
Derm-BOT (Fig. 5A). This implied that pretreatment with Derm-
BOT silenced many of the MOR-expressing neurons in the lumbar dor-
sal horn. Derm-BOT also generated analgesia in NK1R−/− mice (Fig. 5B),
whereas SP-BOT was ineffective, confirming the specificity of the bot-
ulinum constructs.
DISCUSSION
There is an urgent need for new pain-relieving therapies (34). Here, we
used animal models of inflammatory and neuropathic pain to show that
a single injection of compounds derived from botulinum toxin can si-
lence pain-processing neurons in the spinal cord and decrease pain hy-
persensitivity. In two sets of experiments, we targeted NK1R-expressing
neurons that relay pain-related information from the spinal cord to
the brain and the MOR-expressing spinal cells that modulate activity
of NK1R-expressing output neurons (10, 30, 35). We describe a long-
term effect on mechanical pain sensitivity on both inflammatory and
neuropathic pain states after a single injection of the constructs and
demonstrate in vivo receptor specificity. We found no additive
effects of SP-BOT and Derm-BOT, suggesting that, although the
constructs silence different neurons, they are likely to be part of the
same neural pain network with MOR-expressing excitatory neurons
modulating NK1R-positive projection neurons. Hence, these new
botulinum constructs would appear to be equally useful in reducing
pain hypersensitivity.
Among the seven types (A to G) of botulinum toxin that target
neurons, because of its long-lasting activity and high efficiency, BoNT/A
has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for
treating a variety of disorders (36–40). In neuronal cultures, the proteo-
lytic activity of BoNT/A persists beyond 80 days, whereas other subtypes
of BoNT have shorter half-lives (37, 41). Peripheral injections of bot-
ulinum neurotoxins have been shown to reduce both neuropathic pain
and the frequency of migraine attacks in human patients (42–44). This
antinociceptive action has been exploited by a number of groups (44, 45);
more recently, using a synthetic procedure, it was possible to separate
the pain relieving from the paralyzing actions by synthesizing peptide
components of BoNT/A and “restapling” them into a unique
configuration (15, 16). Systemic administration of these reassembled
molecules was shown to inhibit neuronal activity without causing tox-
icity (18). To generate the botulinum-based molecules, we used a syn-
thesis procedure that allowed nonchemical linking of recombinantly
produced proteins using core components of the SNARE complex to
achieve irreversible linkage of two separate peptide fragments into a
functional unit (16). This approach was particularly important because
the production of functional botulinum-based molecules has significant
safety issuesdue to protein toxicity. The assembly of the functionaltoxin
from innocuous parts is therefore an important advance because safety
issues have severely restricted the development of botulinum-derived
molecules for medical use.
We generated new molecules by substituting the nonspecific neuro-
nal binding targeting domain of BoNT/A with ligands that recognize
the key G protein–coupled neurotransmitter receptors NK1R and
MOR. Binding to these receptors was followed by internalization of
the construct and, because of the inclusion of the translocation domain
into our constructs, release of the protease domain of the toxin into the
cytoplasm and inhibition of synaptic release. The synthesis of SP-BOT
has been previously described (15), but synthesizing the Derm-BOT

 construct required further synthetic steps. Dermorphin is a potent se-
lective MOR agonist (31, 32, 46) and has been successfully used previ-
ously in saporin conjugates to selectively ablate MOR-expressing
neurons (13). Conjugation of dermorphin to the LcTd portion of bot-
ulinum was complicated because dermorphin binds to the receptor
through its N terminus, the portion of the molecule generally used
for the botulinum conjugation procedure (16). To circumvent this pro-
blem, we introduced a synthetic inversion procedure (see Methods) that
allowed conjugation of dermorphin to the LcTd portion of botulinum
toxin while retaining the free N terminus of dermorphin for binding to
the MOR, followed by internalization and SNAP25 cleavage.
It is likely that the separation of the botulinum translocation do-
main from the neuropeptide ligands using the “stapling” mechanism
allowed sufficient freedom for the translocation domain to perform
the pH-dependent structural transition necessary to facilitate transfer
of the botulinum protease from the luminal space of vesicle into the
neuronal cytosol. However, it has been reported (47) that attachment
of SP directly to botulinum protease allowed entry into neurons and
SNAP25 cleavage. Omission of the obligatory translocation domain
from the construct suggests that the activity would have been sub-
optimal and may account for the short in vivo efficacy (47).
SNAP25, the unique substrate for botulinum peptidase activity, is
found throughout dendrites, where a role in spine morphogenesis has
been proposed (48), and in cell bodies and axons. NK1Rs are located on
dendrites and cell bodies, whereas MOR is also found on axons and ax-
on terminals and binding and internalization would be expected at most
receptor binding sites (25, 49, 50). Given the lack of axonal NK1R ex-
pression, the presence of cSNAP25 in spinal to brainstem axons after
spinal treatment with SP-BOT was most likely the result of cleavage of
SNAP25 in NK1R-positive dendrites and cell bodies in the dorsal horn,
followed by axonal transport of cSNAP25 and/or the protease to the
synaptic terminals within the brainstem.
NK1R-expressing spinal projection neurons have been shown to be
essential for the maintenance of pain states (11). Information related to
injury reaches the brain largely through NK1R-positive projection neu-
rons of the superficial dorsal horn that terminate massively in the para-
brachial area of the brainstem and, to a lesser extent, within the
thalamus (35, 51). The parabrachial area is crucial for supplying
information to forebrain areas that generate the affective-motivational
component of pain (52, 53), whereas thalamic afferents terminate with-
in cortical areas concerned with both pain discrimination and affect
(51). Forebrain activation can, in turn, regulate dorsal horn sensitivity

 by activating descending controls from the brainstem to the spinal cord
(3, 12, 54). Thus, a shift in the balance between pain inhibiting and fa-
cilitating controls from the brainstem, informed by NK1R-positive dor-
sal horn projection neurons, plays a role in setting spinal nociceptive
thresholds required by on-going behavioral priorities and may ultimately
contribute to pathological pain states (54). It follows that the inflamma-
tory and neuropathic mechanical allodynia are disrupted by intrathecal
ablation or silencing of these NK1R-expressing projection neurons with
SP-saporin (11) or SP-BOT constructs, respectively. Recent work has
shown that chemotoxic ablation of the NK1R-positive pain pathway in
companion dogs can relieve bone cancer pain (14), demonstrating the ap-
plicability of the approach to higher mammals in different pain subtypes.
The disadvantage of the SP-saporin procedure is that it takes several
weeks to become effective and kills neurons (11, 14). Our intention was
to design a reversible and nontoxic molecule that would achieve the
same analgesia rapidly and without cell death. The approach described
here using SP-BOT silences NK1R-expressing neurons without cell
death and is effective in days rather than weeks; in addition, SP-BOT
isrelativelyeasytosynthesize.Asexpected,theanalgesiceffectofSP-BOT
constructs was completely lost in NK1R−/− mice.
MOR is expressed by dorsal horn interneurons and found in
some small-diameter primary afferent sensory fibers (49, 55, 56).
However, previous research has implied that the opioid tolerance and
opioid-induced hyperalgesia that follow repeated injections of mor-
phine are mediated by primary afferent MORs (55). It was also shown
that intrathecal morphine produced strong mechanical and thermal
antinociception in naïve mice but that was lost in mice in which MOR
had been deleted only from primary afferents (55), suggesting that spi-
nal neurons expressing MORs did not play a role in setting baseline
mechanical thresholds or the generation of analgesic tolerance after re-
peated injections of morphine. However, intrathecal Derm-BOT in
naïve mice reported here had no effect on baseline mechanical pain sen-
sitivity but only on mechanical thresholds in injury-induced pain states.
This suggests that the target for Derm-BOT–mediated analgesia was
not primary afferents expressing MOR but MOR-positive dorsal horn
neurons. A similar result was reported in rats after the partial ablation
of MOR-expressing neurons with dermorphin-saporin (Derm-SAP)
conjugates (57), raising the possibility that presynaptic opiate recep-
tors may not internalize after opiate agonist administration (58).
Currently, new approaches to the control of chronic pain have
adopted both central intrathecal and peripheral systemic approaches.
Intrathecal opioids and other drugs are often given in clinical practice
to relieve chronic pain when other treatment routes are exhausted or to
circumvent the inherent risks of long-term systemic opioid treatment.
However, intrathecal administration requires a surgically embedded
pump to administer a prolonged infusion of the drug to the spinal cord
(59, 60). Intrathecal treatments primarily target and inhibit central sen-
sitization, the driving force behind chronic pain states. Unfortunately,
long-termintrathecalopioidadministration can result in respiratory de-
pression, intrathecal granuloma, opioid tolerance, and other serious side
effects (61). Moreover, although systemic opioids remain the gold stan-
dard for pain control, there are major concerns around the problems of
drug overdose and addiction in part due to the relaxation of prescribing
of opioids for nonterminal chronic pain (9). Conjugates of the silencing
domain of botulinum toxin with SP or dermorphin provide substantial
analgesia without evident toxic effects and over long periods of time af-
ter a single intrathecal injection. Complete analgesia is not entirely de-
sirable. As clinical studies with antinerve growth factor, antibodies have
demonstrated that encouraging the use of an already damaged limb
may have resulted in further damage leading to hip or knee replacement
(62, 63). The successfuluse of SP-saporin in rodentsanddogsalso opens
up the possibility that silencing of this pathway with SP-BOT might be
sufficient to control chronic pain states in human patients without per-
manent damage to the spinal cord (11, 14). In addition, the side effects
of chronic opioid use including analgesic tolerance, paradoxical opioid-
induced hyperalgesia, and addiction (64) might be avoided by a single
intrathecal injection of the Derm-BOT construct.
Translatingknowledgefrompreclinicalobservationsinanimalmodels
of pain states to new therapies in the clinic has been difficult and has met
with limited success. Differences between animal behavioral tests and hu-
man chronic pain features, particularly the assessment of both sensory
and affective features of the pain state, and measurements of long-term
efficacy and species variability may have been confounding factors (6).
Nevertheless, the successful translation of the SP-saporin treatment from
rats to companion dogs with bone cancer pain suggests (11, 14) that there
is potential for the introduction of botulinum-based silencing approaches
for the control of pain without cytotoxicity or recourse to repeated treat-
ment of analgesics that can produce adverse behavioral effects.
METHODS
Study design
This study was designed to evaluate the effect of SP-BOT and Derm-
BOT on pain sensitivity. In behavioral studies, mice were randomly
assigned to experimental groups. The experimenter was always blind to
treatmentandgenotype. We couldnot predictaprioritheeffectsize forthe
botulinum constructs, and we were guided by Mead’s resource equation.
Therefore, we aimed to use at least 6 mice in each group and no more than
11. Occasionally, mice were excluded from the study if they were found to
havebodilydamagefromfightingwithcagemates(5of206totalmicewere
discarded). We did perform statistical analysis at the end of each round of
experiments to satisfy the 3Rs (replacement, reduction, and refinement),
which dictates that “The number of animals used should be the minimum
number that is consistent with the aim of the experiment” (www.nc3rs.org.
uk/the-3rs). Raw data for all experiments is presented in table S3.
Mice
Subjects in all experiments were adult mice (8 to 12 weeks old). WT
mice were C57BL6/J from Envigo. NK1R−/− and WT littermates were
obtained from a colony of mice derived from a 129/Sv × C57BL/6 ge-
netic background (21). NK1R−/− mice were backcrossed with a WT
C57BL6/J mouse for several generations. Experiments were always
carriedout using littermates fromheterozygousbreeding pairs. All mice
were kept in their home cage in a temperature-controlled (20° ± 1°C)
environment, with a light-dark cycle of 12 hours (lights on at 7:30 a.m.).
Food and water were provided ad libitum. All efforts were made to
minimize animal suffering and to reduce the number of animals used
(UK Animal Act, 1986).
Genotyping
For genotyping, DNA was extracted from ear tissue, and the following
primers were used for polymerase chain reaction (PCR): NK1R primer,
5′-CTGTGGACTCTAATCTCTTCC-3′(forward)and5′-ACAGCTGT-
CATGGAGTAGATAC-3′ (reverse); neomycin-resistant gene (NeoF)
primer, 5′-GCAGCGATCGCCTTCTATC-3′. Samples from WT
mice showed a single PCR product of 350 base pairs (bp); samples
from NKR1−/− mice showed a single PCR product of 260 bp; and
samples from heterozygous mice would present both bands (21).

 Design and purification of botulinum constructs
Each BoNT/A consists of three domains: the binding domain, the trans-
location domain, and the catalytic light-chain domain, a zinc metallopep-
tidase. We used a protein stapling technique to produce LcTd conjugated
to SPor dermorphin, a naturally occurring mu-opioid agonist that carries
an unnatural D-amino acid, making it resistant to internal proteolysis.
The synthesis that has been described previously for SP with in vitro
controls for specificity is detailed in (15). Briefly, to synthesize the
constructs, first, fusion protein consisting of the LcTd of the botulinum
type A1 strain was fused to SNAP25 (LcTd-S25) and was prepared as
previously described (16, 65). The chemically synthesized syntaxin-SP
peptide had the sequence Ac-EIIKLENSIRELHDMFMDMAML-
VESQGEMIDRIEYNVEHAVDYVE-Ahx-Ahx-RPKPQQFFGLM-
NH2, where Ahx stands for aminohexanoic acid. Because of the need
for the N terminus of dermorphin to be accessible for binding to the
MOR, the syntaxin-dermorphin peptide was synthesized in two parts,
syntaxin-maleimide and dermorphin-cysteine, which were then bio-
orthogonally conjugated through two reactive C termini. The dermorphin
and syntaxin sequences were YaFGYPS and EIIRLENSIRELHDMFMD-
MAMLVESQGEMIDRIEYNVEHAVDYVEK, respectively.
Second, the protein “staple” was prepared recombinantly from the
rat vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 (VAMP2) sequence (amino
acids 3 to 84) inserted into the XhoI site of pGEX-KG. Oriented attach-
ment of peptides to protein was achieved by the SNARE assembly reac-
tion. LcTd-S25, VAMP2 (3 to 84), and either syntaxin-dermorphin or
syntaxin-SP were mixed at a molar ratio of 1:1:1 in 100 mM NaCl (so-
dium chloride), 20 mM Hepes, and 0.4% n-octylglucoside at pH 7.4
(buffer A). Reactions were left at 20°C for 1 hour to allow formation
of the SNARE ternary complex. SDS-resistant and irreversibly assembled
protein conjugates were visualized using Novex NuPAGE 12% bis-tris
SDS–PAGE (polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) gels (Invitrogen) run
at 4°C in a NuPAGE MES SDS running buffer (Invitrogen). All recom-
binant proteins were expressed in the BL21-Gold (DE3)pLyss strain of
Escherichiacoli(Agilent)inpGEX-KGvectorsasglutathioneS-transferase
(GST) C-terminal fusion proteins cleavable by thrombin. GST fusion
constructswerepurifiedbyglutathioneaffinitychromatographyandcleaved
by thrombin. Synthetic peptides were made by Peptide Synthetics Ltd.
Cortical cultures
To confirm construct efficacy, rat cortical neurons were dissected
from 8 to 12 embryonic day 17 rat pups and washed in Hanks’
balanced salt solution (HBSS) before being treated with trypsin for
15 min at 37°C, followed by addition of deoxyribonuclease (DNase;
Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were resuspended in 1 ml of triturating solution
[1% AlbuMAX (Gibco), trypsin inhibitor (0.5 mg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich),
and DNase in HBSS (1 mg/ml)]. Cells were triturated using three pro-
gressively smaller glass pipettes before being diluted to 5 ml by the
addition of cortical medium. Fifty thousand cells in 150 ml of medium
were plated on 96-well plates coated with poly-D-lysine. Cells were
maintained in a neurobasal medium (Gibco) supplemented with
1% B27 (Gibco), 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 1% GlutaMAX (Gibco).
Half the medium was changed every 3 to 4 days, and cultures were tested
between 1 and 3 weeks after plating.
Western analysis of botulinum activity
Derm-BOT and SP-BOT [400 nM in buffer A (100 mM NaCl and
20 mM HEPES)] were added to the plated cortical cells at a 1:20 dilution
to achieve the final concentration of 20 nM. Cells were incubated at
37°C, 5% CO2 for 65 hours before culture media was removed, and
20 ml of a loading buffer [56 mM sodium dodecyl sulfate, 0.05 M tris-
HCl (pH 6.8), 1.6 mM UltraPure EDTA (Gibco), 6.25% glycerol,
0.0001% bromophenol blue, 10 mM MgCl2, benzonase (26 U/ml;
Novagen)] was added to each well. Plates were shaken at 900 rpm
for 10 min at 20°C, and samples were transferred to a fresh 0.5-ml tube.
Samples were boiledfor 3 min at 95°Cand then run on Novex NuPAGE
12% bis-tris SDS-PAGE gels (Invitrogen). After separation, proteins
were transferred onto immobilin-P polyvinylidene difluoride mem-
branes and then incubated for 30 min in blotting solution [5% milk
and 0.1% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)]. Mouse mono-
clonal SMI81 antibody (anti-SNAP25) was added at 1:2000 dilution to
the blotting solution at 4°C for overnight incubation. Membranes were
washed three times in 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS for 5 min and then incu-
batedfor30minintheblottingsolutioncontainingsecondaryperoxidase-
conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody (Amersham) at a 1:2400 dilution.
Membranes were washed three times for 5 min in 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS.
Immunoreactive protein bands were visualized using SuperSignal West
Dura Extended Duration solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with expo-
sure to Fuji Medical X-ray Films (Fuji).
Behavioral testing
von Frey filament test
The experimenter was always blind to genotype and treatment group
for all behavioral tests. Animals were placed in Plexiglas chambers, lo-
cated on an elevated wire grid, and allowed to habituate for at least
1 hour. After this time, the plantar surface of the paw was stimulated
with a series of calibrated von Frey’s monofilaments. The threshold was
determined by using the up-down method (66). The data are expressed
as log of the mean of the 50% pain threshold ± SEM. In some cases, the
data were plotted as force (gram; figs. S8 and S9).
Rotarod test
Motor performance was evaluated by an accelerating rotarod apparatus
with a 3-cm-diameter rod starting at an initial rotation of 4 rpm and
slowly accelerating to 40 rpm over 100 s. Mice were expected to walk
at the speed of rod rotation to keep from falling. The time spent on the
rod during each of two trials per day was measured and expressed in
seconds. Animals were tested only once at baseline to minimize the
number of tests on the rotarod. Testing was completed when the mouse
fell off the rod (that is, from a height of 12 cm).
Pain models
Mouse inflammatory models: CFA-induced ankle
joint inflammation
Inflammation was induced by injection of 5 ml of CFA (Sigma-Aldrich)
into the left ankle joint under isoflurane anesthesia induced in a chamber
delivering 2% isoflurane combined with 100% O2 and maintained during
injection via a face mask. The needle entered the ankle joint from the
anterior and lateral posterior position, with the ankle held in plantar flex-
ion to open the joint (67).
Mouse inflammatory models: CFA-induced hind
paw inflammation
CFA (20 ml) was injected subcutaneously into the plantar surface of the
left hind paw using a microsyringe with a 27-gauge needle. Mice were
maintained under isoflurane anesthesia during the injection.
Mouse neuropathic model: SNI
The SNI was performed as previously described (68). Briefly, under iso-
flurane anesthesia, the skin on the lateralsurface of the thighwasincised,
and a section made directly though the biceps femoris muscle exposing

 the sciatic nerve and its three terminal branches: the sural, the common
peroneal, and the tibial nerves. The common peroneal and the tibial
nerves were tight-ligated with 5-0 silk and sectioned distal to the ligation.
Great care was taken to avoid any contact with the spared sural nerve.
Complete hemostasis was confirmed, and the wound was sutured.
Intrathecal injections
Intrathecal injections were performed under anesthesia (69). The mice
were held firmly but gently by the pelvic girdle using thumb and
forefinger of the nondominant hand. The skin above the iliac crest was
pulled tautly to create a horizontal plane where the needle was inserted.
Using the other hand, the experimenter traced the spinal column of the
mouse, rounding or curving the column slightly to open the spaces
between vertebrae. A 30-gauge needle connected to a 10-ml Hamilton
syringe was used to enter between the vertebrae. After injection, the
syringe was rotated and removed, and posture and locomotion
were checked. All intrathecally delivered drugs were injected in a
3-ml volume.
Immunohistochemistry
Mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital and perfused transcardially
with physiological saline containing heparin (5000 IU/ml), followed by
4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in a 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB; 25 ml per
adult mouse). Lumbar spinal cords were dissected out, fixed in 4% PFA
for an additional 2 hours, and transferred into a 30% sucrose solution in
a PB containing 0.01% azide at 4°C for a minimum of 24 hours. Spinal
cord sections were cut on a freezing microtome set at 40 mm. For fluo-
rescent immunohistochemistry, sections were left to incubate with
primary antibodies overnight at room temperature (anti-cSNAP25 anti-
body recognizing the cleaved end of SNAP25 1:50,000 ref, TRIDEANQ;
anti-NK1, guinea pig, 1:10,000, Neuromics; anti-MOR, rabbit, 1:10,000,
Neuromics). For NK1R and MOR immunohistochemistry, direct
secondary antibody was used at a concentration of 1:500 (Alexa Fluor).
For cSNAP25 staining, appropriate biotinylated secondary antibody
was used at the concentration of 1:400 and left for 90 min. Sections
were then incubated with avidin-biotin complex (1:250 Vectastain A
plus 1:250 Vectastain B; ABC Elite, Vector Laboratory) for 30 min, fol-
lowed by a signal amplification step with biotinylated tyramide solution
(1:75 for 7 min; PerkinElmer). Finally, sections were incubated with
fluorescein isothiocyanate–avidin for 2 hours (1:600). An antibody
against Iba1 (ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1; goat, 1:500,
overnight, Abcam) was used to identify microglia and an anti-GFAP
(glial fibrillary acidic protein) antibody to stain for astrocytes (rabbit,
1:4000, overnight, Dako) by immunohistochemistry. The direct
secondary antibody was used at a concentration of 1:500 (Alexa Fluor).
All fluorescent sections were transferred to glass slides and cover slips
applied with Gel Mount Aqueous Mounting Medium (Sigma-Aldrich)
to prevent fading and stored in dark boxes at 4°C. In colabeling studies,
controls included omission of the second primary antibody.
Quantification of fluorescence
For quantification of NK1R and MOR fluorescence, a region of interest
(ROI) was located over laminae I/II. The ROI was 3087 mm2 for NK1R
and 1617 mm2 for MOR immunostained tissue. Fluorescence was
measuredfor six sectionsperanimal using the same ROI. Readingswere
taken from the side of the spinal cord contralateral to the inflamed paw
or nerve lesion. Contrast enhancement and fluorescence threshold were
kept constant. Readings from saline and botulinum construct intrathecal-
injected mice were compared.
c-Fos immunohistochemistry
c-Fos immunohistochemistry was used to assess the silencing of the lam-
ina I NK1R-positive neurons. Preemptive intrathecal treatment with SP-
BOT in naïve mice was followed 3 days later by an injection of CFA into
the left paw under isoflurane anesthetic. Six hours later, animals were per-
fused and processed for c-Fos expression in the lateral parabrachial area.
For DAB (3,3′-diaminobenzidine), sections were blocked in a PB with
3% serum, 3% triton, and 2% H2O2 for 1 hour and then incubated over
weekend with the primary antibody (anti–c-Fos, rabbit, 1:10000, Milli-
pore Merck KGaA). The sections were then incubated in an appropriate
secondary antibody at 1:500 for 2 hours, followed by incubation with
avidin-biotin complex (1:1000 Vectastain A plus 1:1000 Vectastain B;
ABC Elite, Vector Laboratory) for 1 hour. The substrate was then devel-
oped using a peroxidase substrate DAB kit (Vector#SK4100)at optimized
times, and the sections were washed and mounted. The following day,
the sections were dehydrated in increasing ethanol concentrations (70%,
70%, 95%, 95%, 100%, 100%, histoclear ×2) and coverslipped with DPX.
Five sections throughthe LPb fromeachmouse were analyzedforpop-
ulation density of c-Fos neurons. c-Fos–immunoreactive neurons were
countedinthelateralparabrachialareabilaterally.Countsfromthesections
were averaged, and the mean was used for further statistical analysis. To
quantify cSNAP-positive neuronal cell bodies, four spinal cord sections
from each mouse were counted. Means were taken for each treatment
for further analysis. Counts were from laminae I to III of the dorsal horn.
Statistical analysis
All statistical tests were performed using the IBM SPSS Statistics pro-
gramme (version 20), and P < 0.05 was considered statistically signifi-
cant. For the behavioral experiments, statistical analysis was performed
on the data normalized by log transformation (von Frey data), as sug-
gested by Mills et al. (70). Difference in sensitivity was assessed using
repeated measures two-way or one-way ANOVA, as appropriate and
as indicated. In all cases, a significant effect of the main factor(s), or in-
teractions between them, was taken as the criterion for progressing to
post hoc analysis. Bonferroni correction was the preferred post hoc ap-
proach when we had three groups or more; in this case, if the general
ANOVA was significant but no Bonferroni significance was observed,
then we also reported the results of the least significant difference post
hoc analysis. When we had two groups, we report the result of the one-
way ANOVA. In all cases, “time” was treated as a within-subjects factor,
and “genotype” and “treatment” were treated as between-subject
factors. The statistical significance in Fig. 2D was determined using
one-way ANOVA, followed by Fisher’s least significant difference test.
The MPE was calculated as:
%MPE¼
100 � ½logðdrug induced thresholdÞ � logðvehicle induced thresholdÞ�
logð0:6Þ � logðvehicle induced thresholdÞ
½
�
where log(0.6 g) is our maximum von Frey’s force applied. Please note
that, as in our previous paper (67), we logged the data of the behavioral
tests to ensure a normal distribution because the von Frey’s hairs are dis-
tributed on an exponential scale. Mills et al. recently demonstrated that
logtransformationmakesmore“mathematicalandbiologicalsense”(70).
