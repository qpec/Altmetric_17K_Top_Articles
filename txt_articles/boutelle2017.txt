IMPORTANCE Family-based weight loss treatment (FBT) is considered the gold-standard
treatment for childhood obesity and is provided to the parent and child. However,
parent-based treatment (PBT), which is provided to the parent without the child, could be
similarly effective and easier to disseminate.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether PBT is similarly effective as FBT on child weight loss over
24 months. Secondary aims evaluated the effect of these 2 treatments on parent weight loss,
child and parent dietary intake, child and parent physical activity, parenting style, and parent
feeding behaviors.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Randomized 2-arm noninferiority trial conducted at an
academic medical center, University of California, San Diego, between July 2011 and July
2015. Participants included 150 overweight and obese 8- to 12-year-old children and their
parents.
INTERVENTIONS Both PBT and FBT were delivered in 20 one-hour group meetings with
30-minute individualized behavioral coaching sessions over 6 months. Treatments were
similar in content; the only difference was the attendance of the child.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome measure was child weight loss (body
mass index [BMI] and BMI z score) at 6, 12, and 18 months post treatment. Secondary
outcomes were parent weight loss (BMI), child and parent energy intake, child and parent
physical activity (moderate to vigorous physical activity minutes), parenting style, and parent
feeding behaviors.
RESULTS One hundred fifty children (mean BMI, 26.4; mean BMI z score, 2.0; mean age,
10.4 years; 66.4% girls) and their parent (mean BMI, 31.9; mean age, 42.9 years; 87.3%
women; and 31% Hispanic, 49% non-Hispanic white, and 20% other race/ethnicity) were
randomly assigned to either FBT or PBT. Child weight loss after 6 months was −0.25 BMI z
scores in both PBT and FBT. Intention-to-treat analysis using mixed linear models showed
that PBT was noninferior to FBT on all outcomes at 6-, 12-, and 18-month follow-up with a
mean difference in child weight loss of 0.001 (95% CI, −0.06 to 0.06).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Parent-based treatment was as effective on child weight loss
and several secondary outcomes (parent weight loss, parent and child energy intake, and
parent and child physical activity). Parent-based treatment is a viable model to provide
weight loss treatment to children.

 O
ne-third of American children are overweight or
obese,1 which is associated with significant negative
health outcomes.2-8 Family-based treatment (FBT) is
considered the most effective model for the treatment of
children with obesity in the short term and long term.9-13
Family-based treatment is delivered to both parents and chil-
dren in separate groups and includes nutrition and physical
activity education and behavior therapy techniques. How-
ever, FBT is provided mainly in academic medical centers
and can be challenging to attend for busy families because it
requires attendance by both parent and child at specific
group times.
Family-based treatment programs for parents without
their child (parent-based therapy [PBT]) have favorable pre-
liminary data.14-17 A 2013 systematic review showed that
PBT programs have similar outcomes to FBT programs18 and
are more cost-effective.19 However, the studies are small and
underpowered, with short follow-ups. To our knowledge, no
study has evaluated an appropriately powered, controlled
comparison of FBT and PBT with longer follow-up.
This study reports the main outcomes of a randomized
clinical trial evaluating whether PBT is noninferior to FBT
on child weight outcomes at 6 months, 12 months, and 24
months. As secondary aims, we compared the 2 programs
on parent weight, child and parent energy intake, and child
and parent physical activity. Because FBT is grounded in
changing parent behavior to assist their child, we included
parenting style and parent feeding behaviors as secondary
outcomes.
Methods
Study Design
The Family, Responsibility, Education, Support and Health
(FRESH) study was a randomized clinial noninferiority trial
that evaluated two 6-month treatments for childhood obe-
sity: FBT, provided to parent and child, and PBT, provided to
parent only, conducted between July 2011 and July 2015 in
the greater San Diego, California, area. Both FBT and PBT
included nutrition and physical activity recommendations,
parenting skills, and behavior modification strategies. Both
groups were led on the same night of the week with the same
group leaders, who attended weekly supervision with the
first author. The only difference between FBT and PBT was
the attendance of the child. Measures were collected at base-
line, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, and 18 months. The pri-
mary outcome measure was change in child weight (body
mass index [BMI] z score) during the 18-month period. Sec-
ondary outcomes included changes in child and parent
energy intake and physical activity, changes in parent weight
(BMI), parenting style, and parent feeding behaviors. Full
design details of the trial have been reported,20 and the for-
mal trial protocol can be found in Supplement 1. The institu-
tional review boards of University of California, San Diego,
and Rady Children’
s Hospital, San Diego, California approved
the study. Written consent and assent was obtained from par-
ents and children, respectively.
Eligibility and Recruitment
Eligibility included a child between 8.0 and 12.9 years of age
with a BMI between the 85th and 99.9th percentiles, a parent
in the household with a BMI of at least 25 who could read
English at a minimum of a fifth-grade level, and availability
to participate in the study on designated evenings. Exclu-
sionary criteria included a major child or parent psychiatric
disorder, child diagnosis of a serious current physical dis-
ease, child with physical limitations, or a family with food
restrictions. One hundred fifty children with overweight/
obesity and their parent were recruited through primary
care physicians, schools, listserves, local advertisements,
and advertisements.
Intervention
Child-parent dyads were randomly assigned to FBT or PBT
stratified by sex of the child. The treatment programs in-
cluded 20 visits over 6 months, and the content was based on
published trials of FBT.14,21-23 Parents in both FBT and PBT at-
tendeda1-hourparentgroup.ChildreninFBTattendeda1-hour
simultaneous child group. Children in PBT did not attend any
treatment meetings. Parents in PBT and parents and children
in FBT also attended 30-minute meetings with a behavioral
coach on the same evening. See Boutelle et al20 for additional
details on treatment components.
Outcome Measures
Assessments with child-parent dyads were conducted at
baseline, 3 months (midtreatment; weight only), 6 months
(posttreatment), 12 months, and 18 months. Data collection
was conducted by trained staff and supervised by PhD-level
psychologists. Participants received incentives for time,
travel, and effort at assessments. Measures assessed were:
• Anthropometry (child and parent): height and weight were
measured in duplicate. The mean of the 2 values was used
to calculate BMI (calculated as weight in kilograms divided
by height in meters squared). For children, age-adjusted
BMI percentile (BMI%) and standardized BMI (BMIz) were
calculated.24
• Energy intake (child and parent): energy intake was assessed
with three 24-hour multiple-pass dietary recalls on 3 non-
consecutive days via telephone interview.25 Total energy
intake was calculated using the Nutrition Data Systems for
Research software.
• Physical activity (child and parent): physical activity was
assessed using Actigraph accelerometers, model GT1M
Key Points
Question Do children need to come to childhood obesity
treatment with their parent for it to be effective?
Findings In this randomized clinical trial among 150 children and
their parent, results showed that parent-based treatment
(parent-only, without the child) was noninferior to a family-based
treatment (parent and child) on child weight loss over 24 months.
Meaning The child does not need to come to treatment to lose
weight.

 (ActiGraph Corp). A minimum of 4 of 7 days of wear time
was required to be complete and accommodate error and
noncompliance. All accelerometer data extraction, pro-
cessing, and scoring was conducted by ActiLife software,
version 6.11 (ActiGraph Corp), which provided transformed
summaries aggregated across 30-second epoch lengths.
Epoch-by-epoch estimates of activity were categorized
into intensity-weighted summaries of physical activity
using calibration thresholds previously validated for
adults26 and children.27 Outcome variables were mean
minutes per day of moderate and vigorous intensity physi-
cal activity.
• Children’
sReportofParentalBehaviorInventory(child)28:this
56-item measure assesses child’
s perceptions of their par-
ent’
s behavior (mother and father separately) and results in
3 subscales: psychological control vs psychological au-
tonomy, acceptance vs rejection, and firm vs lax control.
• Birch Child Feeding Questionnaire (parent)29: this 21-item
measure assessed parent’
s beliefs, attitudes, and practices
regarding child feeding. Three scales were used: restriction,
pressure to eat, and monitoring.
• Feasibility and acceptability: feasibility was assessed by
number of sessions attended and overall attrition. Accept-
ability was assessed using questions designed by the study
team specifically for this study. Parents responded to
questions regarding the convenience of their assigned
group, how much they liked the program, and how much
they thought the program changed their family and child’
s
lifestyle.
Statistical Power
Power calculations focused on noninferiority tests for the pri-
mary outcome of child BMIz. All power calculations were con-
ducted using SAS Proc Power with α = .10, corresponding to
use of the upper bound of the 90% CI to test the noninferior-
ityhypotheses(SASInstituteInc).Asamplesizeof150wasused
to account for dropout and achieve power greater than 0.80.
See Boutelle et al20 for additional details.
Statistical Analysis
The primary analyses were performed for the intention-to-
treat population, defined as the child-parent dyads who were
allocated to either FBT or PBT. For the primary weight out-
comes, we used linear mixed effects (LME) regression mod-
els of child BMIz and parent BMI assessed at 3 months, 6
months, 12 months, and 18 months.
We conducted a planned noninferiority analysis of child
BMIz to determine whether a 2-tailed upper bound of the 90%
CI of the treatment effect would rule out our prespecifed dif-
ference in BMIz across treatments.30 Noninferiority hypoth-
esis were supported if the upper bound of the 90% CI for the
main effect of treatment was less than our prespecified non-
inferiority margin. We set the upper bound of expected
change of −0.13 to −0.17 BMIz units using the covariate-
adjusted pooled standard deviation of changes in BMIz at 6
and 12 months follow-up in our previous study.14 We set the
lower bound of expected change to suggest an effect at least
half as big as we expected from the FBT treatment (50% of
0.13; 0.065). The fixed-margin approach was used and was
successful if the lower limit of the 90% CI around the differ-
ence between FBT and PBT was found to greater than the
margin from −0.049 to 0.051 BMIz. Superiority analyses were
conducted for the other variables, using similar LME models
with planned covariates; age, sex, the linear effect of time,
and corresponding baseline values. Analysis of longitudinal
outcomes used multiple imputed data sets (m = 50) using
multivariate imputation by chained equations.31 We present
estimated treatment effects for both maximum likelihood
estimation of available data and estimates from models across
50 multiple imputed data sets.

 missing BMI at more than 2 assessments showed no sig-
nificant differences between FBT and PBT participants (β =
−1.11;SE=0.61;P = .07).Nochildorparentadverseeventswere
reported.
Primary Outcome: Child Weight Loss
As seen in Figure 2, children in both PBT and FBT experi-
enced similar decreases in BMIz by the end of the treatment
period that was largely sustained through the 18-month as-
sessment.Examinationofunconditionalmodelssuggestedthe
benefit of including both random intercept and slope terms
(χ2 = 37.07; P < .001). The main effect of treatment group from
adjusted LME models of BMIz provided an estimate and stan-
dard error of differences in the magnitude of change in child
weight.ThedifferenceinBMIzobservedbetweenPBTandFBT
over assessments was 0.001 (90% CI, −0.05 to 0.05; Table 2).
Inpooledestimationfrommultipleimputeddatasets(m = 50),
the difference in BMIz was 0.007 (90% CI, −0.04 to 0.06). This
observed effect interval was greater than the noninferiority
margin of −0.13 to −0.065 and thus supported noninferiority
(see eTable in Supplement 2 for outcome measures by treat-
ment arm across the 18-month period).
Secondary Outcomes: Parent Weight Loss,
Child and Parent Energy Intake, Child and Parent
Physical Activity, and Parenting
As seen in Figure 2, there were no significant differences be-
tween FBT and PBT parents’BMI across assessments (β = 0.15;
SE = 0.28; P = .59). However, there was support for a small and
statistically significant increase in the rate of change in BMI
over time for parents in PBT relative to FBT after the 6-month
time point (β = 0.02; SE = 0.01; P = .04). Mean (SD) percent
weight loss for parents in FBT and PBT was −3.9% (5.3) and
−5.0% (5.5) at 6 months and −1.1% (6.7) and 2.8% (13.4) by the
final 18-month time, respectively. When restricted to parents
who were overweight/obese on enrollment, we observed simi-
lar results, with no significant difference in BMI changes for
FBT and PBT participants (β = 0.25; SE = 0.29; P = .38; see
eTable in Supplement 2 for means).
Table2presentsmaineffecttermscomparingFBTandPBT
using LME models with planned covariates for daily energy in-
take and minutes of moderate and vigorous intensity physi-
cal activity. For children (β = −2.87; SE = 46.01; P = .95) and par-
ents (β = 15.30; SE = 46.99; P = .75) in either FBT or PBT, there
was no significant difference in daily energy intake con-
sumed across assessments and no significant difference in the
rate of change in daily energy intake over time for children
(group by time interaction). However, there was a trend for less
rapid increases in energy intake in parents in FBT compared
with parents in PBT following the 6-month follow-up, increas-
ing a mean of 10.7 fewer kcal/mo during the study (β = −10.7;
SE = 5.5; P = .06). No significant differences between FBT and
PBT were observed in moderate and vigorous intensity physi-
cal activity among children (β = 0.98; SE = 7.61; P = .90) or par-
ents (β = −2.87; SE = 2.81; P = .37; see eTable in Supplement 2
for means).
We also conducted comparisons between FBT and PBT
using LME models with planned covariates for the Children’
s
ReportofParentalBehaviorInventoryandChildFeedingQues-
tionnaire, using Benjamini-Hochberg32 methods. We did not
observe significant differences between treatment groups on
anyoftheChildren’
sReportofParentalBehaviorInventoryand
Child Feeding Questionnaire scales (data not shown). We also
assessed each scale as a potential moderator in effect of treat-
ment group on child BMIz over assessments. In separate mod-
els, baseline levels of each parenting measure were entered in
primary outcome models of BMIz along with its interaction

lossofparticipantsduringtheearlyphasesoftreatment,asevi-
denced by the 24% attrition at 3 months and 27% attrition at
6 months, compared with 12% and 8% attrition for FBT at the
sametimes.Innegativebinomialregressionmodels,therewere
no significant associations between parent age, racial/ethnic
group, baseline weight, sex, or number of treatment sessions
attended.
In terms of acceptability, parents in the PBT program rated
it less convenient (somewhat/very inconvenient) compared
with FBT parents (12 of 55 [21.8%] vs 6 of 68 [8.8%]) and some-
what less parents in PBT liked the program (somewhat/very
much liked) compared with FBT parents (45 of 52 [86.5%] vs
65 of 68 [95.6%]). However, similar numbers of parents in PBT
and parents in FBT felt that the program (somewhat/very
much) helped change their family and child’
s lifestyle (49 of
53 [92.5%] vs 62 of 66 [93.4%]).
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale clinical study to
testthenoninferiorityofaPBTprogramcomparedwithanFBT
program for children with overweight/obesity over 24 months.
Consistent with previous evidence, the PBT program was non-
inferior to FBT on child weight outcomes, child and parent en-
ergy intake, child and parent physical activity, and parenting
measures at the 6-month, 12-month, and 18-month follow-
ups.ThePBTprogramwasnoninferiortoFBTonparentweight
outcomes at the 6-month follow-up; however, PBT parents
gained more weight over time. Additionally, there was greater
attrition and lower acceptability ratings in the PBT compared
with the FBT group.
We included evaluations of parenting and parent behav-
iors because parents are the most important people in a child’
s
environment. In the process of helping their child lose weight,
theyservetoverballyteachtheirchildrentheweightcontrolma-
terial, model healthy behaviors, and reinforce the acquisition
andmaintenanceofhealthyeatingandexercisebehaviors.Note-
ably, there were no significant differences found between
changes in parenting style and feeding behavior between the 2
groups over time. Additionally, similar numbers of parents in
PBT and FBT felt that the program helped their family change
their lifestyle. This trial highlights that PBT and FBT affect par-
enting style and feeding behavior in the same manner and that
child attendance is not necessary to achieve similar outcomes.
Consistent with our previous study,14 there was greater re-
tentioninFBTcomparedwithPBTat6months;however,these

 differences were somewhat attenuated by 18 months. Addi-
tionally,PBTfamiliesattendedameanof2fewermeetingsthan
FBT families. Research shows that attendance is an impor-
tant predictor of child weight loss33-35 and reasons for attri-
tionrangefromtimecommitment,distancefromclinic,missed
school and work, appointment times, schedule, educational
content, and stress.36-40 However, these reasons should ap-
ply to both PBT and FBT equally, suggesting that there is some-
thing unique about PBT that may lead to greater attrition and
decreased attendance. Parent-based treatment was per-
ceived to be less convenient by parents compared with FBT.
Unfortunately, none of the families who dropped gave rea-
sons beyond logistical issues, so we are unable to identify why
more PBT families dropped in this study.
ThePBTinterventionhasanumberofstrengthsthatshould
be noted. First and foremost, PBT has similar outcomes to FBT
in changes in child and parent weight, nutrition, physical ac-
tivity, parenting style, and parent feeding behaviors. Addi-
tionally, because only the parent’
s schedule needs to be con-
sidered, there could be an added flexibility in scheduling. In
PBT, a reliable and caring adult provides all the information
and reinforcement to the child and can adapt the program to
the child’
s needs because they know the child’
s learning strat-
egies and motivators. Parent-based treatment emphasizes the
role of parents as the primary agent of change, which could re-
sult in greater self-efficacy to parents regarding the treat-
ment of their child’
s weight and other child behavioral issues
because the parent management skills learned can be applied
to other child behaviors. However, it is also important to note
that PBT places a large amount of responsibility on the parent
who attends and was not as acceptable.
Family-based treatment also has strengths that should be
noted. In FBT, children learn the material and are reinforced
by the interventionists and other children in the group as well
as by their parents at home. Learning from multiple sources
could provide more durability to changes in the child’
s behav-
ior as the child transitions to adolescence and peer groups be-
come more important. Family-based treatment also had less
dropout than PBT, suggesting that it may be more acceptable
to families. However, in FBT, the responsibility of learning the
information is shared between the parent and child, which
could also allow parents to reduce their involvement.
Limitations
Strengths of the study include the randomized design, the use
of noninferiority testing, the racial/ethnic diversity of the fami-
lies, the use of a validated treatment protocol, and the 24-
month observation period. However, study participants were
treatment-seeking volunteers with 8- to 12-year-old children
whose BMI percentile was less than 99.9%, limiting the gen-
eralizability to families with children of other ages and higher
weight. Additionally, this study did not include a placebo con-
trol intervention. This design was chosen because published
studies show that FBT is superior to no treatment41 and con-
trol groups.42,43
In considering clinical applications, there are a number of
reasons why parents would prefer one model vs the other.
Families may prefer FBT when parents believe that informa-
tion delivered directly to the child is important in achieving
weight loss. Family-based treatment may also be a preferable
modelforchildrenwhowouldbenefitfromsocialsupport.Par-
ent-based treatment may be more enticing to families where
the child does not want to come to treatment or scheduling
does not permit time for FBT. Reasons for parent’
s preference
of model delivery should be explored in future research.
Conclusions
ThisstudyprovidessoundempiricalevidencesupportingaPBT
model for the delivery of childhood obesity treatment. Given
the high rates of obesity in children,1 PBT is a model that could
be used to provide treatment to a greater proportion of the
population.
