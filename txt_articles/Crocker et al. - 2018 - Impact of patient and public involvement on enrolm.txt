ABSTRACT
OBJECTIVE
To investigate the impact of patient and public 
involvement (PPI) on rates of enrolment and retention 
in clinical trials and explore how this varies with the 
context and nature of PPI.
DESIGN
Systematic review and meta-analysis.
DATA SOURCES
Ten electronic databases, including Medline, INVOLVE 
Evidence Library, and clinical trial registries.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA
Experimental and observational studies quantitatively 
evaluating the impact of a PPI intervention, compared 
with no intervention or non-PPI intervention(s), on 
participant enrolment and/or retention rates in a 
clinical trial or trials. PPI interventions could include 
additional non-PPI components inseparable from the 
PPI (for example, other stakeholder involvement).
DATA EXTRACTION AND ANALYSIS
Two independent reviewers extracted data on 
enrolment and retention rates, as well as on the 
context and characteristics of PPI intervention, and 
assessed risk of bias. Random effects meta-analyses 
were used to determine the average effect of PPI 
interventions on enrolment and retention in clinical 
trials: main analysis including randomised studies 
only, secondary analysis adding non-randomised 
studies, and several exploratory subgroup and 
sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS
26 studies were included in the review; 19 were 
eligible for enrolment meta-analysis and five for 
retention meta-analysis. Various PPI interventions 
were identified with different degrees of involvement, 
different numbers and types of people involved, 
and input at different stages of the trial process. On 
average, PPI interventions modestly but significantly 
increased the odds of participant enrolment in the 
main analysis (odds ratio 1.16, 95% confidence 
interval and prediction interval 1.01 to 1.34). Non-PPI 
components of interventions may have contributed 
to this effect. In exploratory subgroup analyses, the 
involvement of people with lived experience of the 
condition under study was significantly associated 
with improved enrolment (odds ratio 3.14 v 1.07; 
P=0.02). The findings for retention were inconclusive 
owing to the paucity of eligible studies (odds ratio 
1.16, 95% confidence interval 0.33 to 4.14), for main 
analysis).
CONCLUSIONS
These findings add weight to the case for PPI in 
clinical trials by indicating that it is likely to improve 
enrolment of participants, especially if it includes 
people with lived experience of the health condition 
under study. Further research is needed to assess 
which types of PPI work best in particular contexts, 
the cost effectiveness of PPI, the impact of PPI at 
earlier stages of trial design, and the impact of PPI 
interventions specifically targeting retention.

Introduction
Poor recruitment and retention of patients in trials 
are major sources of research inefficiency because 
they delay the delivery of research, inflate its costs, 
and can lead to biased findings.1 2 The top inefficiency 
in the conduct of trials from recruitment of the first 
participant to publication of results is failure to meet 
recruitment targets.3 Directors of UK clinical trials 
units have identified “research into methods to boost 
recruitment in trials” and “methods to minimise 
attrition” as the top two priorities for trials methodology 
research.4 In the UK, only 56% of trials funded by the 
Health Technology Assessment programme recruit 
their originally specified target sample size, with 
32% receiving an extension.5 6 Several initiatives 
aimed at improving recruitment and retention in 
clinical trials have been established, including the 
MRC START research programme and Trial Forge.7 8 
Recruitment and retention interventions identified as 
meriting formal evaluation include patient and public 
involvement (PPI).9
In the UK, PPI (also known as “public involvement”) 
has been defined as “research being carried out ‘with’ 
or ‘by’ members of the public (including patients 
WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC
Patient and public involvement (PPI) in clinical trials has the potential to improve 
rates of enrolment and retention of participants
PPI may help by improving trial design, optimising recruitment and retention 
strategies and patient-facing materials, or directly approaching potential 
participants
Whether, when, or by how much, PPI affects rates of enrolment and retention of 
participants is not known
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS
The nature of PPI interventions and the impact of these on trial enrolment and 
retention vary widely between studies
On average, PPI interventions seem to modestly but significantly increase the 
odds of participant enrolment
The impact of PPI on retention rates is less clear and requires further primary 
research evaluating PPI interventions that specifically target retention

Trials in the UK have experienced a recent surge in 
PPI activity, partly because the National Institute for 
Health Research (NIHR) now expects active PPI in the 
research it funds.11 Patients and members of the public 
are primarily involved in agenda setting, steering 
committees, ethical review, protocol development, and 
piloting.12 Many different types of involvement exist, 
from one person to many people or whole patient 
organisations, from one-off involvement in a particular 
aspect of the trial (for example, reviewing draft 
information for patients or recruiting participants from 
their communities) to involvement throughout the trial 
(for example, as members of a trial steering committee), 
and from involvement with no decision making power 
(for example, as advisers) to involvement in decision 
making as equal partners.
Two broad arguments are made for involving 
patients and members of the public in health research: 
the moral argument (those affected by, or paying 
for, research should have a say in what and how it is 
done) and the consequentialist argument (PPI should 
improve the quality, efficiency, and impact of research). 
Because clinical trialists and funders are steeped in a 
predominantly quantitative, evidence based culture, 
the consequentialist argument for PPI in clinical trials 
(for example, that it increases participant enrolment 
rates) is likely to play an important role in the adoption 
of meaningful PPI as routine, widespread practice. 
Hypotheses about how PPI could increase enrolment 
rates include greater access to potential participants, 
improved information sheets, more patient centred 
trial design, more relevant research questions, and peer 
endorsement of research.13-16 One observational study 
of 114 trials reported a doubled odds of successful 
recruitment associated with “consumer input,” but 
this did not attain statistical significance (odds ratio 
2.00, 95% confidence interval 0.36 to 10.05).17 A 
more recent observational study reported a statistical 
association between PPI and success of recruitment 
among UK mental health research studies,13 but 
many potential confounding factors could not be 
controlled for, and information about the nature of 
PPI in the included studies was lacking. Exploring the 
effectiveness of PPI practices to improve recruitment 
and retention of trial participants has been identified 
as one of the top research priorities for PPI in trials.18
This review aimed to measure the impact of PPI 
interventions on recruitment (specifically participant 
enrolment) and retention in clinical trials. A secondary 
objective was to explore how this impact varies 
according to context (for example, patient population, 
recruitment 
setting, 
trial 
treatment/intervention) 
and the nature of the PPI intervention (for example, 
activities, 
involvement 
model, 
and 
other 
PPI 
characteristics).
Methods
Searches
Our systematic literature review followed the PRISMA 
statement.19 We did a systematic electronic search 
in the following databases (last updated October 
2017): Medline, Science Citation Index, Social 
Science Citation Index, Embase, PsychINFO, Cochrane 
Library, CINAHL, and Health Expectations journal. 
We constructed the search strategy by combining 
keywords within four topic domains: clinical trials, PPI, 
enrolment or retention of participants, and potential 
outcomes/change (see appendix 1). In addition to the 
electronic database search, we searched the INVOLVE 
Evidence Library for any papers pertaining to the 
impact of public involvement on health or public 
health research,20 as well as the ClinicalTrials.gov and 
WHO ICTRP clinical trial registries.
Screening and study selection
We conceptualised PPI as a complex intervention,21 
involving human behaviours and often multiple 
interactive 
components. 
We 
included 
papers 
that quantitatively evaluated the impact of a PPI 
intervention, compared with no intervention or another 
non-PPI intervention, on enrolment and/or retention 
rates in a clinical trial or trials in any patient population 
(see eligibility criteria in table 1 for further details). 
We defined “PPI intervention” as an intervention that 
was, or included as an active component, any form of 
PPI consistent with the INVOLVE definition of public 
involvement: “research being carried out ‘with’ or 
‘by’ members of the public rather than ‘to’, ‘about’ or 
‘for’ them,” where the term public includes patients, 
potential patients, carers, and people who use health 
and social care services, as well as people from 
organisations that represent people who use services.10 
This included interventions not necessarily labelled 
or conceptualised as “PPI” by the study authors 
(for example, user testing, peer recruitment, and 
community based participatory research). We included 
interventions in which PPI was integrated with 
additional components inseparable from the PPI (such 
as involvement of other stakeholders) because this is 
consistent with the way patients are often involved in 
practice (for example, being part of an advisory group). 
Hereafter, we refer to such components as “non-PPI 
components” of interventions.
A review restricted to randomised controlled trials 
would give an incomplete summary of the impact of 
PPI, as many types of PPI interventions (for example, 
patient involvement in the early stages of trial design) 
are not amenable to randomisation; we therefore 
included non-randomised as well as randomised 
evaluations, with a plan for assessing risk of bias. We 
accepted all non-randomised study designs (provided 
there was a direct comparison group), including 
non-randomised controlled trials, controlled and 
uncontrolled before-after studies, and observational 
studies. Comparison groups were patients unexposed 
to the PPI intervention (for example, before its 
introduction) or patients exposed to an alternative 
intervention with no PPI (for example, recruitment via 
healthcare professionals). The evaluation did not have 
to be the study authors’ primary research question. We 
put no limits on publication date or language.

Initially, one reviewer (JC) screened all titles 
and abstracts for potentially eligible papers and 
subsequently assessed full text papers against the 
eligibility criteria. Another reviewer (SR) supervised 
this process and provided advice when there was 
uncertainty about eligibility. Later, we received 
funding for a second reviewer (IRC) to independently 
screen all records in addition to JC. At the end of this 
process, JC and IRC compared their results in terms of 
studies included and excluded. Discrepancies were 
discussed and the opinion of a third reviewer (AP) 
was sought when necessary to achieve consensus. We 
contacted authors to provide further information when 
confirmation of eligibility was needed.
AP and IRC also did forwards and backwards citation 
searches by hand searching reference lists of included 
studies and review articles and using the “cited by” 
function in Scopus. Any potentially eligible papers 
were double screened for eligibility by JC.
Data extraction
Using a standardised data extraction form in Microsoft 
Access, one of three reviewers (JC, AP, or IRC) extracted 
qualitative information from each paper about the 
context of the trial, the nature of PPI interventions, 
and the nature and findings of evaluations. This form 
was piloted and revised by JC and AP in the early 
stages. Two reviewers (JC and IRC) then independently 
extracted quantitative data from included papers on 
the primary outcomes (enrolment and retention), 
context, and PPI intervention into a standardised 
Microsoft Excel spreadsheet for the meta-analyses. For 
enrolment, we extracted the number of people invited, 
approached, or reached during the recruitment period 
(denominator) and the number who consented to take 
part in the clinical trial (numerator). We included the 
proxy denominator “total number of participants,” 
where the intervention targeted a subgroup within 
the trial population (such as a minority ethnic group 
or specific geographical region) and the evaluation 
compared subgroup proportions with and without the 
intervention. For retention, we extracted the number 
of people who consented to take part (denominator) 
and the number who adhered to the trial protocol 
and/or completed follow-up for the longest period 
of time investigated by the authors (numerator). We 
chose the context and intervention variables a priori 
(table 2) because we considered them to be potentially 
influential on enrolment and retention outcomes, they 
are sometimes or often reported in study publications, 
and, if categorical, they could be split into no more 
than two or three categories (owing to the small overall 
sample size). This is consistent with recommendations 
that systematic reviews of complex interventions 
include typologies of the structural characteristics 
of the intervention and, where few or no typologies 
exist, that face validity for categorisation be provided 
by experts working in the field.23 We considered 
theories of change underpinning interventions to be 
potentially important, but we could not categorise 
them appropriately for inclusion in this analysis. We 
are doing a realist analysis on the same sample of 
studies to shed light on the underlying theory and 
mechanisms of impact of the included interventions 
(to be published separately).
Discrepancies between the two data extractors (JC 
and IRC) were discussed, and the opinion of a third 
reviewer (AP) was sought if necessary to achieve 
consensus. We sought additional or accompanying 
papers where necessary to obtain the data we needed 
(for example, papers describing the contextual clinical 
trial or the development of the intervention) and 
contacted authors to provide further information when 
insufficient data were reported in available papers.

Intervention
A trial methodology intervention that was, or included as an active component, any of kind PPI consistent with the INVOLVE definition of public involvement: 
“research being carried out ‘with’ or ‘by’ members of the public rather than ‘to’, ‘about’ or ‘for’ them.”10 The term “public” includes patients, potential patients, 
carers, and people who use health and social care services, as well as people from organisations that represent people who use services. The PPI  
contributor(s) 
had to be either a patient, a carer, or a lay member of the public; research or healthcare professionals with the health condition under investigation were 
 
included as PPI, but research or healthcare professionals only sharing a characteristic with the target population other than health condition (eg, ethnicity, sex, 
age) were excluded. Qualitative research was included as a form of patient or public consultation, as this was previously deemed PPI in an INVOLVE report of 
impact of PPI.16 However, as qualitative research is excluded from many definitions of PPI, a sensitivity analysis without this type of study was done
Comparator
No intervention or another trial methodology intervention with no PPI. Studies with no direct comparison group were excluded (eg, those comparing enrolment 
and/or retention rates against what might be expected for that patient population)
Outcome
Enrolment and/or retention rate, defined as the proportion of potential participants enrolled and the proportion of enrolled participants retained, respectively. 
Enrolment included giving consent to take part or being randomised to the trial. Studies that assessed hypothetical participation or willingness to participate 
in clinical trials, rather than actual enrolment in a trial, were excluded. Retention included adherence to a treatment programme and/or follow-up  
procedures. 
At the start of data extraction for the meta-analyses, for pragmatic reasons a decision was taken to exclude studies with no appropriate enrolment rate 
 
denominator (eg, enrolment reported as absolute numbers rather than rates). This led to the retrospective exclusion of some studies that had been included 
during initial screening
Context
Clinical trial or trials, defined by the World Health Organization as “any research study that prospectively assigns human participants or groups of humans to one 
or more health-related interventions to evaluate the effects on health outcomes.” Interventions include but are not restricted to drugs, cells and other biological 
products, surgical procedures, radiological procedures, devices, behavioural treatments, process of care changes, preventive care, etc. This definition includes 
phase I to phase IV trials.22 For inclusion in the review, the primary outcome had to be a measure of health status; studies of trials with a behavioural or other 
non-clinical primary outcome were excluded
Study design
Non-randomised (including observational) studies as well as randomised studies were included, as randomisation would not be practical for many PPI 
 
interventions

Risk of bias assessment
Two reviewers (JC and IRC) independently assessed the 
risk of bias of the studies included in meta-analyses by 
using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for randomised 
studies and the ROBINS-I tool for non-randomised 
studies (with pre-specified potential confounding 
domains of time, funder, and patient population).24 25 
Discrepancies were discussed and a third reviewer 
consulted if necessary to achieve consensus. The 
studies were assessed for risk of bias in relation to 
our review question, not the study authors’ primary 
research question (which often differed from ours, 
particularly for the non-randomised studies).
Meta-analyses
The only criterion for carrying out meta-analyses 
was the availability of sufficient outcomes. We took 
the view that any amount of statistical heterogeneity 
would be acceptable,26 and we considered that, even 
in the presence of high heterogeneity, an estimate of 
the average effect of PPI interventions across studies 
and the statistical significance of this effect were 
worth reporting. We did two separate meta-analyses to 
determine the average impact of PPI interventions on 
enrolment and retention. We combined the numbers 
of participants enrolled and retained with and without 
PPI by using a random effects DerSimonian and Laird 
meta-analysis to report odds ratios. We used the 
Hartung-Knapp-Sidik-Jonkman variance correction 
to calculate 95% confidence intervals reflecting 
the uncertainty in heterogeneity estimates.27-29 We 
examined statistical heterogeneity by using the 
I2 statistic and by calculating approximate 95% 
prediction intervals (which indicate a predicted 
range for the true effect of a PPI intervention in an 
individual study)30 using methods reported by Higgins 
et al.31 Because of high methodological and statistical 
heterogeneity across non-randomised studies, we 
made a post-hoc decision to present findings from 
randomised studies only as our main analysis. We then 
did a secondary analysis including non-randomised 
studies as well as randomised studies. Where multiple 
non-PPI recruitment strategies had been used within 
a non-randomised study, we pooled the data for 
comparison with the PPI recruitment strategy. Where 
multiple PPI interventions had been compared within 
a study, we included both interventions as separate 
comparisons in the meta-analysis and split numbers 
of participants in the comparator group equally across 
the two intervention arms.

We did pre-planned subgroup analyses on all 
included studies (randomised and non-randomised 
combined) to explore the influence of context 
and characteristics of the PPI intervention on the 
association between PPI interventions and enrolment 
rates and to investigate sources of heterogeneity 
(table 2). We used univariable meta-regression to 
determine whether differences between subgroups 
were statistically significant.
We did sensitivity analyses on both the main analysis 
(randomised studies only) and the secondary analysis 
(randomised and non-randomised studies combined). 
These excluded studies at high risk of bias, studies 
with small sample sizes (n<100), PPI interventions 
that included additional non-PPI components, PPI 
interventions that were formal qualitative research 
(and therefore not universally classified as PPI), 
and studies using a proxy denominator to measure 
enrolment rate (see table 2).
We used Peters’ test to examine small study 
effects.32 33 As only two included studies investigated 
the cost per participant enrolled of PPI versus non-
PPI interventions, we did not do a meta-analysis for 
this outcome. We used Stata 14.0SE for all analyses, 
with a threshold of P<0.05 to determine statistical 
significance.
Patient and public involvement
The idea for this review emerged from meetings with 
an advisory panel for JC’s research fellowship in 
PPI impact assessment, which included two patient 
partners (including author AC). The patient partners 
were involved in the group to ensure that the research 
was relevant to, and informed by the perspectives of, 
patients and members of the public. They were chosen 
because of their long term experience of involvement 
in health research and their interest in impact 
assessment. The decision to do this review was in part 
due to our patient partners’ desire to quantitatively 
assess the impact of PPI, particularly on recruitment of 
patients to clinical trials, because “a trial that recruits 
more quickly will ultimately benefit patients more 
quickly.” While the review was underway, one patient 
partner (MO) retired and a third (RH) joined the group.
The patient partners provided input at six advisory 
group meetings and email correspondence in between 
meetings. As well as helping to decide on the review 
question, they helped to decide on our definition of 
PPI, which contextual and intervention characteristics 
to explore and how to categorise them, and which 
potential confounding factors to focus on in the 
risk of bias assessments. In addition to influencing 
these decisions, their enthusiasm and belief in the 
importance of this work helped to maintain the lead 
author’s motivation through what was a challenging 
piece of work. Working in partnership with patients 
has been a very positive experience for the researchers 
in the team, and we have not identified any negative 
effects on the research. Our current patient partners 
(AC and RH) report multiple positive aspects of their 
involvement, including being interested in the topic 
and endorsing its importance, feeling welcomed and 
respected as part of the project team, and feeling 
that their contributions are valued and responded to. 
Negative aspects have included difficulty following the 
conversation and contributing during teleconference 
meetings (sometimes necessary because of the long 
geographical distance between RH and the lead 
author) and having only a limited understanding of the 
mathematics of the meta-analysis.
Results
Characteristics of studies included in systematic 
review
Our search results yielded 11 856 records. After 
excluding duplicates, two independent reviewers 
screened 6939 titles and abstracts and assessed 134 
full text articles for eligibility. Twenty six studies met 
the criteria for inclusion in the review (fig 1).
Table 3, table 4, and table 5 show the detailed 
characteristics of all included studies. Most were 
conducted in the USA or the UK, and together they 
covered a wide range of clinical topic areas and 
trial interventions. The PPI interventions were also 
diverse. Patients and/or members of the public were 
involved in different activities: eight studies involved 
patients or lay people in designing recruitment and 
retention strategies (for example, as community 
partners, members of a community advisory board, 
or focus group participants),34 41 51 55 66 69 75 76 12

involved patients or lay people in directly recruiting 
or retaining participants (for example, hiring lay/
community workers or asking existing participants 
to refer friends/relatives).34 36 46 47 51 60 65 67 72 79 The 
extent of involvement ranged from one patient 
advocate acting as a panellist in a one-off educational 
seminar for recruiting clinicians,59 to more than 80 
people helping to develop a patient friendly online 
trials registry,41 42 or community partners initiating 
and leading their own recruitment strategies.51 76 
Many intended purposes of involvement also existed, 
including increasing trust between communities 
and researchers,34 46 51 60 65 79 improving the quality 
and acceptability of patient-facing information or 
recruitment messages,39 41 43 53 61 63 78 accessing 
potential participants via existing participants,36 67 
and increasing the cultural competence of the research 
among minority ethnic communities.36 46 60 67 69 72 75 76 79 
Many of the PPI interventions also included non-
PPI components, such as the involvement of other 
stakeholders or experts,41 58 61 65 69 75 or novel modes of 
information delivery that were not a direct consequence 
of the PPI.45 53 60 67 72 78 79

Other (non-PPI) components*
Authors’ proposed mechanism
MacEntee et al, 
200260
To improve recruitment of 
ethnic minorities
At least one contact person in each 
community centre served as a volunteer 
interpreter and cultural liaison between 
potential recruits and researchers
Recruitment by researchers via commu-
nity centres, including posters and an 
introductory lecture about the trial
Using active and trusted members of 
the community to communicate with 
potential recruits
Man et al, 
201561 62
To improve recruitment to 
trial
PIS underwent three rounds of user 
testing with members of the public
Input by experts in writing for patients 
and graphic design (before user testing)
Improving the readability and 
 
presentation of patient information 
sheets
Martin et al, 
201363 64
To improve recruitment to 
trial
All women who refused to participate 
in the trial were asked open ended 
questions about their reasons for refusal. 
The research team used this feedback to 
improve their recruitment message
Researchers analysed women’s feedback 
and made changes to the recruitment 
message
Identifying and overcoming barriers to 
recruitment
Moinpour et al, 
200065
To improve recruitment of 
minority ethnic men to the 
trial
“Enhanced minority recruitment 
programme,” included hiring African- 
American and Hispanic recruiters, several 
of whom were respected members in 
their minority communities
The enhanced minority recruitment 
 
programme included multiple other 
components such as special training in 
minority recruitment for site staff and 
consultation with experts in minority 
recruitment
Reducing the time taken to identify 
potential participants, establish trust, 
and introduce the trial
Porter et al, 201666 To achieve a 40% increase 
in accrual to clinical trials 
over a 2 year period
The “comprehensive programme” 
included the leadership team informally 
reaching out to patients at the outset 
and intermittently during the campaign 
to increase accrual. A cancer survivor 
was pictured and quoted on publicity 
to encourage patients to enquire about 
clinical trial opportunities
The programme was multifaceted and 
included tasking centre leadership with 
increased oversight of the entire process 
of patient accrual to trials, education of 
all stakeholders, increased oversight of 
the portfolio of clinical trials by disease 
specific committees, and optimisation of 
accrual operations and infrastructure
Equipping all stakeholders 
( 
patients, their families, nurses and 
staff,  
physicians, disease specific 
 
committees, and centre  
leadership) 
with the necessary skills and 
 
information to complete the clinical 
trial accrual process
Sanders et al, 
200967 68
To improve recruitment to 
the trial
“Word of mouth” recruitment strategy in 
which the research team organised morn-
ing teas for participants and invited them 
to bring a friend who could potentially 
enrol in the trial
The morning teas provided a social 
opportunity for participants and potential 
participants to meet researchers face 
to face
Giving participants a sense of 
 
“belonging and ownership of the 
project” and providing an opportunity 
for the friend to enrol in the trial
Tenorio et al, 
201169-71
To improve recruitment of 
Hispanic people to the trial
A Hispanic community focus group, 
including two lay people, advised on 
recruitment strategies
The community focus group included 
healthcare and research  
professionals. 
The recruitment strategy was also 
informed by a literature review of factors 
affecting recruitment of Hispanic people 
to clinical trials
Tailoring the recruitment plan to the 
Hispanic community; identifying 
and overcoming cultural barriers to 
recruitment
Tenorio et al, 
201472-74
To improve recruitment of 
Hispanic people to the trial
Lay consultants from the Hispanic 
 
community approached potential 
participants
Culturally tailored recruitment  
strategies 
including use of bilingual Hispanic 
staff, bilingual recruitment materials 
and  
seminars, and announcements at 
predominantly Hispanic churches
Overcoming cultural barriers to 
recruitment of Hispanic people; 
maximising adherence to Hispanic 
cultural norms
Vicini et al, 201175
To decrease ethnic minority 
healthcare disparities and 
increase representation of 
ethnic minorities in cancer 
clinical trials
Minority outreach programme, 
 
involving collaboration with community 
based  
organisations from five major 
ethnic/ 
minority populations. Hospital 
 
representatives worked with community 
leaders to develop culturally competent 
programmes, leading to a series of 
forums presented within each ethnic 
minority community
The collaboration included hospital 
representatives who were available at 
recruitment forums to inform patients 
about the clinical trials available at the 
hospital
Providing culture specific, bilingual 
cancer education and information 
on prevention and screening in a 
 
culturally competent manner
Vincent et al, 
201376 77
To increase recruitment and 
retention in trial
Catholic church partners suggested a 
recruitment strategy based on healthy 
living/diabetes prevention presentations 
at the churches
None
Minimising cultural and 
 
contextual barriers to recruitment; 
 
maximising positive relationships, 
 
communication, trust, and respect, 
which are particularly important when 
working with Mexican Americans
Wallace et al, 
200678
To improve patients’ 
 
understanding of the 
 
treatment options and 
 
facilitate accrual to trial
During a 90 minute patient education 
session (intervention), a prostate cancer 
survivor and trial participant shared his 
(positive) experience of clinical trials with 
patients
The patient education session also 
included an informed consent video 
and a joint presentation by a urologist 
and radiation oncologist comparing 
and contrasting their modalities and 
introducing the concept of a randomised 
controlled trial
Providing balanced information 
about the treatment options, thereby 
increasing patients’ acceptance of 
randomisation
Wisdom et al, 
200279
To improve recruitment and 
retention in trial
Active recruitment of participants by faith 
based organisations and churches in the 
community
As well as pastors, the study’s  
principal 
investigator also made regular 
 
announcements from the pulpit
Building trust, accessibility, caring, 
reciprocity, and sensitivity, based on 
two theoretical models to improve 
recruitment of culturally diverse 
 
populations and access to care
PIS=patient information sheet.
*Other non-PPI components implemented before or at the same time as the PPI component. When the PPI intervention was suggested or led by PPI contributors, it was considered to be “pure” PPI 
even if the suggested intervention included other non-PPI aspects.

Characteristics of studies included in meta-analyses
We included 19 studies (21 PPI interventions) 
reporting data from 178 921 participants in our 
enrolment meta-analyses and five studies (six PPI 
interventions) reporting data from 6520 participants 
in our retention meta-analyses. Table 6 shows the 
aggregate characteristics of these studies, including 
those used in subgroup and sensitivity analyses.
Six studies could not be included in the enrolment 
meta-analyses owing to insufficient data, despite our 
attempts to contact study authors and identify related 
papers. Three of these studies reported no significant 
impact of PPI interventions on enrolment,58 59 65 
and the other three studies reported an increase in 
enrolment rates associated with PPI interventions 
(statistical significance unknown).66 75 78
Risk of bias of studies included in meta-analyses
Of the eight randomised studies, only one was deemed 
to be at “high” risk of bias owing to missing outcome 
data,41 two had “some concerns,”45 46 and five had 
“low” risk of bias.39 47 49 53 61 Of the 12 non-randomised 
studies, 11 were deemed to be at “serious” risk of 
bias,36 43 51 55 60 63 67 69 72 76 79 and one was deemed 
to be at “critical” risk of bias owing to potential 
uncontrolled confounding by patient population, 
time, or both.34 Often this was because the study was 
opportunistic—for example, comparing the success of 
different recruitment strategies—rather than designed 
specifically to evaluate the impact of PPI versus non-
PPI on enrolment or retention.
Impact of PPI interventions on enrolment
Individual study findings
Half (11/21) of the PPI interventions included in 
our meta-analysis were associated with significantly 
higher enrolment rates compared with no PPI or 
non-PPI interventions,36 43 46 51 55 60 63 67 69 72 76 nine 
PPI interventions were not significantly associated 
with enrolment rate,35 39 41 45 49 51 53 61 and one PPI 
intervention was associated with significantly lower 
enrolment (odds ratio 0.41, 95% confidence interval 
0.23 to 0.72).79 In this study, lay community members 
(faith based organisations) attempted to directly recruit 
African-Americans with diabetes to the trial; however, 
this yielded a lower enrolment rate than recruitment 
via the health system (non-PPI). The authors stated 
that this was not surprising, given “the nature of the 
provider-patient relationship” and because “African 
Americans may be less inclined to have their personal 
health history known by other members of their church 
congregation, given the stigma associated with chronic 
illnesses.”79 Contrast this with Vincent et al’s study, 
which showed the largest PPI effect size in our sample 
(odds ratio 13.48, 6.07 to 29.95): here, lay community 
members (Catholic church partners, some of whom 
shared a high risk of diabetes with the Mexican-
American target population) initiated, co-designed, 
and co-delivered a recruitment strategy that was 
highly successful compared with strategies initiated 
by the researchers.77 (Note, however, that both of these 
outlying studies were non-randomised and judged to 
be at high risk of bias.)

Main meta-analysis (randomised studies only)
We included seven randomised studies (eight PPI 
interventions) in our main meta-analysis. These 
interventions all consisted of patient or lay involvement 
in the design or delivery of patient information, with 
Ford et al’s intervention also including recruitment 
sessions hosted by churches in the target community.46

our main meta-analysis showed that, on average, PPI 
interventions modestly but significantly increased the 
odds of a patient enrolling in a clinical trial compared 
with no PPI (odds ratio 1.16, 1.01 to 1.34; P=0.04). We 
found low heterogeneity between studies (I2=0.0%), 
yielding a 95% prediction interval of the odds ratio of 
1.01 to 1.34 (fig 2).
Secondary meta-analysis and subgroup analyses 
(randomised and non-randomise.d studies 
combined)
Our 
secondary 
meta-analysis, 
combining 
19 
randomised and non-randomised studies (21 PPI 
interventions), also found that, on average, PPI 
interventions significantly increased the odds of a 
patient enrolling in a clinical trial compared with no 
PPI or non-PPI interventions (odds ratio 1.87, 1.25 to 
2.80; P=0.004). We found substantial heterogeneity 
between 
studies 
(I2=95.7%), 
yielding 
a 
95% 
prediction interval of the odds ratio of 0.36 to 9.86 
(fig 3). Exploratory subgroup analyses showed that the 
overall positive association between PPI interventions 
and enrolment substantially increased when at least 
one involved person had lived experience of the health 
condition under study (odds ratio 3.14, 1.89 to 5.22) 
and all but disappeared when the involved people had 
no such lived experience (1.07, 0.74 to 1.53). Meta-
regression confirmed that this effect was statistically 
significant (P=0.02). Subgroup differences between 
any of the other variables explored (appendix 2), 
including trial intervention type (simple versus 
complex), the timing of involvement (designing 
recruitment and retention strategies versus developing 
patient-facing information versus direct recruitment 
or retention of participants), and enrolment rate 
denominator (before versus after eligibility screening), 
were not found to be statistically significant using 
meta-regression (P>0.3). Meta-regression was not able 
to explain the high between study heterogeneity, but it 
may be due in part to the diverse range of evaluation 
methods used and the high risk of bias by confounding 
in non-randomised studies. It could also be explained 
by heterogeneity of the PPI interventions: almost all of 
the PPI interventions in the high quality, randomised 
studies were aimed at improving patient information, 
whereas the more complex and more unusual 
interventions were largely evaluated using poorer 
quality observational or quasi-experimental methods.
Sensitivity analyses and Peters’ test
The 
positive 
overall 
association 
between 
PPI 
interventions and enrolment remained statistically 
significant 
throughout 
all 
sensitivity 
analyses 
except when we excluded interventions with non-
PPI components from the secondary analysis (see 
appendix 3). Although the estimated effect of PPI 
interventions actually increased in this analysis (odds 
ratio=2.70), the exclusion of 15/21 studies yielded a 
very wide 95% confidence interval (0.83 to 8.84). We 
could not restrict this particular sensitivity analysis to 
randomised studies because this subsample included 
only one “pure” PPI intervention.49 Peters’ test showed 
no evidence of bias due to small study effects (P=0.92 
for main analysis; P=0.59 for secondary analysis).
Cost effectiveness of PPI interventions
Of the two studies reporting the cost per participant 
enrolled, MacEntee et al reported that a PPI strategy 
to recruit participants at community centres through 
a local contact person, although more effective, was 
more than twice the cost per participant of a non-PPI 
strategy that used postal invitations ($23 (£18; €20) 
v $11).60 Chlebowski et al reported that a PPI strategy 
to recruit trial participants via existing research 
participants was only one quarter the cost of a non-
PPI strategy that used commercial mailing lists to 
send postal invitations ($59 v $259 per participant 
enrolled).36

Impact of PPI interventions on retention
Main meta-analysis (randomised studies only)
Pooling the data from three randomised studies 
(four PPI interventions) in our main meta-analysis 
did not show a statistically significant effect of PPI 
interventions on participant retention (odds ratio 1.16, 
0.33 to 4.14; P=0.73). Results varied widely across 
studies, with effect estimates ranging from odds ratios 
of 0.38 to 2.52 (I2=83.5%; 95% prediction interval 
0.06 to 22.37; appendix 4).
Secondary meta-analysis (randomised and non-
randomised studies combined)
Our 
secondary 
meta-analysis, 
combining 
five 
randomised and non-randomised studies (six PPI 
interventions), also found no statistically significant 
effect of PPI interventions on participant retention, 
compared with no PPI or non-PPI interventions (odds 
ratio 1.20, 0.52 to 2.77; P=0.59). Again, we found 
substantial heterogeneity between studies (I2=78.3%), 
yielding a 95% prediction interval of the odds ratio of 
0.20 to 7.18 (forest plot in appendix 5). At the individual 
study level, only one PPI intervention was significantly 
associated with retention: this constituted use of lay 
community health advisers to support participants (the 
only PPI intervention specifically targeting retention), 
leading to a significant improvement in retention 
rates (odds ratio 2.52, 1.82 to 3.50).47 Apart from 
this example, the PPI interventions primarily targeted 
enrolment, not retention. We did not do subgroup 
analyses for retention outcomes because of the small 
sample size.
Sensitivity analyses and Peters’ test
Sensitivity analyses did not alter the findings (appendix 
6), and Peters’ test showed no evidence of bias due to 
small study effects (P=0.44 for main analysis; P=0.41 
for secondary analysis).
Discussion
This review identified a variety of PPI interventions 
aimed at improving enrolment and retention of 
participants in clinical trials. Patients and lay members 
of the public were involved in designing recruitment and 
retention strategies and patient-facing information, 
identifying and approaching potential participants, 
and troubleshooting when recruitment was poor. We 
did not identify any studies that assessed the impact 
on enrolment or retention of PPI in developing the trial 
question or designing the trial itself.

On average, PPI interventions significantly increased 
the odds of a patient enrolling in a clinical trial, relative 
to no PPI or non-PPI recruitment interventions. This 
remained statistically significant regardless of whether 
non-randomised studies were excluded or included, as 
well as in sensitivity analysis that removed studies at 
highest risk of bias. To illustrate what our main findings 
could mean in practice: in a hypothetical sample of 
1000 patients, of which typically 100 enrol (consistent 
with the 10% average enrolment rate in our sample of 
studies), a PPI intervention similar to those included in 
our meta-analysis of randomised studies would likely 
lead to between one and 30 (average 14) extra patients 
being enrolled. As these PPI interventions were mostly 
restricted to patient or lay involvement in the design 
or delivery of patient information, the effect size might 
be even larger for PPI that begins at earlier stages of 
trial design, as the opportunity to influence patients’ 
views and experiences would extend beyond just the 
provision of information.
A key exploratory finding was that the effect size 
was significantly greater when the people involved 
had lived experience of the health condition under 
study, compared with no such lived experience. This 
is consistent with the view that patients and carers 
can benefit research through their role as “expert in 
lived experience,”80 although the precise mechanisms 
linking 
such 
expertise 
with 
improvements 
in 
enrolment and retention are unclear—something that 
we are exploring in a complementary realist analysis 
of the included studies. This finding, along with all 
other subgroup analysis and meta-regression findings, 
should be interpreted with caution owing to the 
potential for study level confounding.
Far fewer studies evaluated the impact of PPI 
interventions on retention of trial participants. They 
showed, on average, a modest but non-significant 
improvement in retention; the very wide 95% 
confidence intervals mean that we cannot rule out 
a potentially large increase or decrease in retention 
associated with PPI. None of the PPI interventions 
in the retention analysis included people with lived 
experience of the health condition under study, and 
most of them primarily targeted enrolment rather than 
retention.
Strengths and limitations of review
To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to combine 
data on the impact of PPI on enrolment and retention 
in health research, providing a quantitative summary 
and exploring the influence of contextual and 
intervention factors. Our results are consistent with 
previous observational studies that suggested an 
average positive association between PPI and success 
of recruitment in UK based health studies.15 16 Unlike 
these previous studies, our review encompassed 
all geographies and clinical areas, and we were 
able to explore, to some extent, the influence of the 
characteristics and context of PPI.
Our review has several limitations. Most of the 
interventions included non-PPI components, and we 
could not separate out the effects of these from the 
effects of the PPI components. When interventions 
including non-PPI components were excluded in a 
sensitivity analysis of both randomised and non-
randomised studies combined, PPI was still associated 
with improved enrolment but with reduced certainty 
due to the decrease in sample size.
We were unable to explore the influence of many 
potentially important factors such as underlying 
programme theory, the fidelity and sustainability of 
interventions, the quality of relationships between 
involved patients and researchers, and the attitude of 
research leaders towards PPI.23 81 We are undertaking 
a realist analysis of the included papers to shed more 
light on these complexities.23 The framing of PPI as a 
complex intervention is itself controversial,82 but we 
believe that this approach, alongside a range of other 
perspectives, can usefully contribute to the much 
broader debate about the impact of PPI in health 
research.
Our 95% prediction intervals should be interpreted 
with caution because prediction intervals have been 
reported to be less reliable in meta-analyses with 
unbalanced study sizes.83 Also, we were unable to 
provide a useful summary of the cost effectiveness of 
PPI, because very few studies included an economic 
impact assessment; thus an “effective” PPI intervention 
may not necessarily be cost effective. However, 
financial modelling of the impact of PPI in a typical 
oncology trial suggests that PPI interventions that 
improve enrolment may add considerable financial 
value.84
Finally, the findings of this study say nothing 
about the quality or ethical acceptability of PPI in the 
included studies or patients’ views on the importance 
of the clinical trials being conducted. PPI may improve 
enrolment, but this does not rule out negative effects 
such as an emotional cost to the people involved 
or patients feeling coerced into enrolling.85 Should 
patients assume that all trials are conducted for their 
benefit and automatically endorse every trial? Do (and 
should) involved patients have the necessary skills 
to assess the risks involved on behalf of their fellow 
patients? These are important dilemmas that are 
beyond the scope of this study.
Implications for clinical trialists and PPI policy 
makers
Our findings add support to the case for involving 
patients and carers in the design and conduct of clinical 
trials. In the UK, funding proposals and protocols for 
trials are often reviewed by institutional lay panels; 
our review suggests that, ideally, at least some of these 
reviewers would be patients and carers with lived 
experience of the health condition under study.
The apparent failure of some PPI interventions to 
improve enrolment and retention shows that many 
factors other than PPI also influence these outcomes. 
In addition, some PPI interventions in our review were 
one of several recruitment strategies used by clinical 
trialists and may not have been sufficient alone; for

example, Sanders et al found that although their 
word of mouth PPI strategy was relatively effective at 
enrolling those it reached, it contributed only 2.2% 
of the total participants owing to limited reach (200 
people), compared with 70.3% for the targeted mail-
out strategy (which reached 21 400 people).67 PPI 
will not solve all recruitment and retention problems, 
and clinical trialists would be wise to implement 
multiple additional strategies to minimise the risk of 
poor enrolment and retention. Furthermore, involving 
patients in the early stages of trial development can 
sometimes lead researchers to abandon the whole 
idea of the trial,86 suggesting that if the target patients 
are not convinced that the trial question is worth 
answering, PPI in later stages of the trial (such as those 
seen in this review) may be futile.
Unanswered questions and future research
Well planned, high quality evaluations are needed 
to improve our understanding of the impact of PPI 
on enrolment and retention in clinical trials. In 
particular: which types of PPI work best in particular 
settings and contexts; the mechanisms underlying the 
impact of PPI on enrolment and retention; the cost 
effectiveness of PPI interventions (an important part 
of the drive to improve trial efficiency); the impact 
of PPI interventions specifically targeting retention 
(which has received very little attention relative to 
enrolment); and the impact of PPI at the early stages of 
trial proposal and design.
