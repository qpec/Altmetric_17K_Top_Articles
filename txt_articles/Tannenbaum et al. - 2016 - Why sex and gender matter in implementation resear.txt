Why sex and gender matter in
implementation research
Cara Tannenbaum1,2*, Lorraine Greaves3 and Ian D. Graham4
Abstract
Background: There has been a recent swell in activity by health research funding organizations and science journal
editors to increase uptake of sex and gender considerations in study design, conduct and reporting in order to
ensure that research results apply to everyone. However, examination of the implementation research literature
reveals that attention to sex and gender has not yet infiltrated research methods in this field.
Discussion: The rationale for routinely considering sex and gender in implementation research is multifold. Sex and
gender are important in decision-making, communication, stakeholder engagement and preferences for the uptake
of interventions. Gender roles, gender identity, gender relations, and institutionalized gender influence the way in
which an implementation strategy works, for whom, under what circumstances and why. There is emerging
evidence that programme theories may operate differently within and across sexes, genders and other intersectional
characteristics under various circumstances. Furthermore, without proper study, implementation strategies may
inadvertently exploit or ignore, rather than transform thinking about sex and gender-related factors. Techniques
are described for measuring and analyzing sex and gender in implementation research using both quantitative
and qualitative methods.
Summary: The present paper describes the application of methods for integrating sex and gender in implementation
research. Consistently asking critical questions about sex and gender will likely lead to the discovery of positive
outcomes, as well as unintended consequences. The result has potential to strengthen both the practice and
science of implementation, improve health outcomes and reduce gender inequities.

Background
Efforts to integrate sex and gender throughout all phases
of the health research cycle have been rising sharply over
the past two decades [1–4]. Since 2010, the Canadian
Institutes
of
Health
Research
has
been
requiring
researchers to indicate whether their research protocol
accounts for sex or gender, using the term “sex” to refer
to the biological attributes that distinguish male from
female, and the term “gender” to refer to men and
women’s socially constructed roles, identities and beha-
viors [5, 6]. As of 2016, the U.S. National Institutes of
Health Research asks applicants to explain how they
plan to factor consideration of sex as a biological vari-
able into their research design and analysis [7, 8]. The
Gender Advisory Group to the European Framework
Program for Research and Innovation also mandates the
Gender Dimension across all sectors [9]. Journal editors
are encouraged to increase accountability around sex
and gender reporting requirements, by using the Sex
and Gender Equity in Research (SAGER) guidelines [10,
11]. These events beg the question: how have research
methods in implementation science addressed sex and
gender? For the purpose of this article, we will use the
term implementation research and practice (IRP) to
include knowledge translation, implementation research
and practice.
The opening argument for this debate article is that to
date, despite the evidence on the impact of sex and

 gender on health, research methods in the field of imple-
mentation have neglected sex and gender considerations.
An analysis of selected literature in IRP supports this
proposition. For example, a review of the tables of
contents and indexes of three popular implementation
science texts [12–14] reveals that none devote a chapter
to the role of sex and gender in implementation science.
Only one includes gender in the index [14], which refers
to a chapter in the text with a few lines describing how
many sexually transmitted infection interventions target-
ing racial/ethnic minorities are gender specific and how
the strategies to reach men and women may differ [15].
Searching the top 10 articles of 2015 as reported by
Implementation Science (see Additional file 1: Appendix 1)
for the words sex or gender shows that only one makes
a minor mention of gender as it relates to controlling
for ‘clinician gender’ in a modeling exercise [16]. Sex
and gender also do not appear to play a prominent role
in implementation theories. For example, in Nilsen’s
review [17] of implementation theories, models and
frameworks, only 2 make minor references to gender
[18, 19]. One simply includes ‘gender’ as one of the
barriers to optimal clinical practice under the category
“health care professional/physician barriers” [18] and
the other includes a footnote about a study they were
citing, that “a fourth factor, gender of participants, was
also related to program outcomes but was not included
in their subsequent analysis” [19]. Furthermore, neither
of the germinal papers on the Theoretical Domains
Framework [20, 21], a widely used and influential
framework [22] that guides assessment of barriers to
implementation, makes any reference to sex or gender.
There is a domain in the framework that focuses on
‘social/professional role and identity’
, which could cap-
ture elements of sex and gender, but usually tends to be
limited to assessing professional roles and almost never
identity, let alone sex or gender identity.
Turning to the knowledge synthesis literature on
implementation, the Cochrane Collaboration’s Methods
Equity group [23] is active in increasing awareness of
the need and methods for sex and gender analysis in
systematic reviews [23–25]. Both the Effective Practice
and Organisation of Care (EPOC) and Consumers and
Communication review groups have official guidance in
their resources for authors on equity [26, 27]. A recent
assessment of a sample of systematic reviews from these
two groups however, reveals limited consideration of sex
and gender in the written report. For example, of 12
EPOC and seven Consumer and Communication re-
views published between July 2014 and May 2015, none
addressed sex or gender in the analysis or implications
sections of the report (Personal Communication, Jennifer
Petkovic, Peter Tugwell and Vivian Welch on behalf of
the Campbell and Cochrane Equity Methods Group,
April 13, 2016). It is possible that the review authors
did consider sex and gender in their analyses and
determined it was unimportant. However, they failed
to report this.
Little research has been undertaken or reported to
inform how sex and gender impact IRP, as evidenced by
this analysis of key texts, well-used conceptual models,
and Cochrane reviews on implementation strategies. The
objective of this paper is to describe the rationale for why
and how sex and gender should be considered in IRP.
Discussion
What is sex? What is gender?
A first step for understanding how to integrate sex and
gender in IRP involves operationalizing the two terms,
and recognizing different components of gender. The
term sex refers to a biological construct, whereby an
individual is defined as being male or female according
to genetics, anatomy and physiology [6, 7, 11, 28–32].
Researchers should use the term sex when describing
the number of male or female patients or committee
members, or when stratifying outcomes by male versus
female participants or health care providers. It is more
appropriate to say what the distribution by sex of a sam-
ple or target audience is, than to use the term ‘gender
distribution.’ This is because gender is a multifaceted
and fluid construct, influenced in a temporal manner by
social and cultural contexts and environments to create
gender norms [6, 7, 11, 28, 30–35]. Gender norms influ-
ence commonly accepted ways of how people behave,
how they perceive themselves and each other, how they
act and interact, and the distribution of power and
resources in society [6, 28, 31–35]. Gender can be struc-
tured by, and operating within ethnicity, indigenous
status, social status, sexuality, geography, socioeconomic
status, education, age, disability/ability, migration status,
and religion, requiring an intersectional approach to
implementing practices, programs and policies [36, 37].
The acronym “PROGRESS” can be used to remember
these variables: place of residence, race/ethnicity/culture/
language, occupation, gender/sex, religion, education,
socioeconomic
status,
and
social
capital
[38].
Re-
searchers often understand gender as a function of
gender roles (e.g. child care, housework), gender identity
(e.g. personality traits such as being sensitive to the
needs of others or having leadership abilities), gender re-
lations (e.g. social support), and institutionalized gender
(e.g. career opportunities, personal income, educational
background) [6, 28, 34]. Gender as a broad term can also
refer to the expressions and identities of girls, women,
boys, men, and gender diverse people [39, 40]. For this
reason, definitions of sex and gender are evolving as
science changes, and it remains challenging to easily
separate the biological from the social. Sex and gender

 are often interrelated, interactive and potentially insep-
arable [6, 11]. Given the epistemology of knowledge,
and the social nature of implementation and behavior
change, the effect of gender and other identity factors,
either alone or in combination, can serve as barriers or
enablers to the outcome or impact of IRP interventions.
Measuring and understanding sex and gender
Collecting and analyzing data on sex in IRP is relatively
simple if using typical male and female categories. Sex
can be self-reported, designated by an examination of
external genitalia, or genetically determined based on an
XX, XY or intersex genotype [11]. Data on sex-related
factors can include measuring sex hormones, body and
organ size, metabolism, or fat tissue distribution [41].
Gender is more complex, and can be operationalized
along four different constructs: gender roles, gender
identity, gender relations and institutionalized gender
[6, 28, 31, 32]. Table 1 defines these four constructs,
gives examples of key questions that can be asked of
each in IRP, and lists measures and methods for use in
IRP research [6, 28, 31, 32, 42–44].
Traditionally, individuals are asked to categorize their
sex as male or female and many assumptions, often
based in gender and not biology, are made on the basis
of their responses. Researchers are now rethinking this
approach to be more inclusive of gender identity and
expression [39]. A two-step approach to measuring sex

Gender roles
[6, 28]
Represent the behavioral norms
applied to men and women in
society, which influence
individuals’ everyday actions,
expectations, and experiences.
Gender roles often categorize and
define individuals within the
family, the labour force, or the
educational system. May form the
basis for stereotypes.
How can considering
gender roles help us
understand and anticipate
barriers and opportunities
facing health-care
professionals in the uptake
of new interventions?
How can considering
gender roles help inform
dissemination strategies
that are successful in
reaching different
audiences where they are?
The Gender Role Conflict Index [73]
Other variables such as occupation
[45], primary breadwinner status,
time doing household chores and
caregiving responsibilities can also
be used to capture gender roles in
data collection and analysis [46].
Gender identity
[6, 28, 32,
39, 40, 42]
Describes how we see ourselves,
and are seen by others, as female
or male, or across a feminine-
masculine continuum. Individuals
may also self-identify dynamically
along the continuum of gender-
queer and/or transgender. Gender
identity affects our feelings and
behaviors.
Do a range of gender
identities need to be
considered when asking
the question, “for whom
does this implementation
strategy work and under
which circumstances?”
Will the reach of the
implementation
intervention extend to
male, female and
transgender individuals?
The BEM sex role inventory [74]
The Personal Attributes
Questionnaire [75]
Should the content of the
implementation
intervention consider
gender identity or sexual
orientation?
The Conformity to Masculine
Norms Inventory [76],
A two-step approach to measuring
gender identity first asks individuals
to indicate their sex assigned at birth
(male/female), and then asks the
same individuals how they currently
self-identify (male, female, trans
male/trans man, trans female/trans
woman, gender queer/gender non-
conforming) [39, 40].
Gender relations
[6, 28, 33]
Refers to how we interact with or
are treated by people in the
world around us, based on our
ascribed or experienced gender.
How might the outcomes
of implementation
interventions differ by sex
and gender according to
whether the degree to
which the geographic
setting is culturally
homogeneous, diverse or
gender equitable?
What are the implications
of an implementation
intervention being
communicated or delivered
to women only, men only,
men and women
separately or together?
How is this mediated by
cultural context?
The Self-Perceived and Self-Reported
Gender Equality scale [77].
Institutionalized
gender
[6, 28, 33]
Reflects the distribution of power
between men and women in the
political, educational, and social
institutions in society. The
institutionalized aspect of gender
also shapes social norms that
define, reproduce, and often
justify different expectations and
opportunities for men and women.
If particular decision-maker
groups value, use, or require,
different kinds of know-
ledge, have you considered
how institutionalized gender
might play a role? How
might this change over
time?
How can dissemination
messages be crafted in a
way that responds to sex
and gender–related factors
without reproducing or
exploiting any negative
stereotypes embedded in
institutionalized gender?
The use of qualitative methods
(e.g. case studies, ethnography,
narrative and descriptive qualitative
approaches etc.) can be used to
explore concepts of institutionalized
gender, and to gain a more in-depth
understanding of gender as a barrier
or enabler.
Tannenbaum et al. BMC Medical Research Methodology  (2016) 16:145

 and gender identity could first ask individuals to indicate
their sex assigned at birth (male/female), and then ask
the same individuals how they currently self-identify,
which could include male, female, trans male/trans man,
trans female/trans woman, gender queer/gender non-
conforming; and provide space to self identify as another
option not provided [40]. Similarly, participants could
also be given the option to disclose sexual orientation
and whether they consider themselves part of the lesbian,
gay, bisexual or transgender (LGBT) community.
The scales in Table 1 list measures that can be used to
quantify different dimensions of gender. Researchers can
also create gender scales using gender-related variables
of relevance to their particular research topic [45, 46].
Pelletier et al. created a composite gender score using 7
characteristics: 1) status on primary earner; 2) personal
income; 3) number of hours per week spent doing
housework; 4) status of primary person responsible for
doing housework; 5) level of stress at home; 6) mascu-
line traits; and 7) feminine traits. They were able to
demonstrate that gender, independent of sex, predicts
poor outcome after acute coronary syndrome, pointing
to new areas of intervention [44].
Qualitative methods are also useful for the collection
of data on specific dimensions of gender. Case studies,
ethnography,
narrative
and
descriptive
qualitative
approaches can provide evidence and contextualized
insight across a range of participants’ personal charac-
teristics, including those of sex and gender. Qualitative
methods can also be used to explore concepts of insti-
tutionalized gender, and to gain a more in-depth under-
standing of gender as a barrier or enabler to the use of
implementation interventions, the uptake of the evidence-
informed clinical interventions or program and the out-
comes of implementation efforts. A number of texts,
casebooks, examples and online courses are available
that provide guidance on how to conduct sex and
gender science using commonly employed quantitative
and qualitative methods [6, 32, 42, 43].
The case for considering sex and gender in implementation
research methods
Emerging evidence suggests that sex and gender are
important in decision-making, stakeholder engagement,
communication and preferences for the uptake of inter-
ventions. Furthermore, when gender norms, identities
and relations are ignored, unintended consequences may
occur. The following five scenarios give examples of
when and why sex and gender should be measured and
considered in implementation research:
1. When the implementation of an intervention
requires decision-making on the part of individuals
or organizations. Decision-making is a critical
component of behavior change interventions, and
plays a key role in the uptake of new organizational
practices and programs [47]. Research from the
fields of business and management offer insights for
IRP on important sex and gender factors related to
decision-making [48–50]. Qualitative research
conducted by Deloitte Consulting with 18 large
business organizations suggests that female executives
have a tendency to be more attuned to micro-level
signaling during meetings, and may favour discovery
options and iterative thinking during decision-
making processes [48]. Male executives tend to end
a conversation once they connect with a good idea
or solution. Their female counterparts are inclined
to be more inquisitive, wanting to hear everyone’s
thoughts before deciding, and taking more time to
find the ideal solution. Different leadership traits
among male and female leaders can therefore influence
the outcome of decision-making processes [49, 50].
2. When sex and gender dynamics may play a role in
stakeholder engagement and conflict resolution. A
survey queried reasoning methods among 624
corporate board directors, of whom 75 % were
male and 25 % female [51]. Female directors scored
significantly higher scores on the complex moral
reasoning dimension, which implies attending more
to relationships and to the challenge of balancing
multiple stakeholders’ interests. Females may also
engage in more collaboration and consensus building,
not only to make sound decisions but also to elicit
common support for a course of action [49, 50].
The outcome of an implementation intervention
may therefore depend on the sex and gender
dynamics in each particular context.
3. When communication strategies are being tested,
as sex and gender may be differentially responsive
to the choice of language used, the strength of
persuasion of the communication strategy, and
the way promotional information is processed.
This is why sex and gender form the basis for
market segmentation in the fields of marketing
and consumer behaviour, where subtle changes
in language and emotional appeal can have a
differential effect on men and women’s attitudes
towards the brand advertised and purchase
intentions [52]. The way messages and interventions
are primed or packaged to reflect gender norms or
stereotypes may also influence the outcomes of
health promotion interventions. For instance,
priming individuals to the perception that women
eat healthier foods than men leads both male and
female study participants to prefer healthy foods,
whereas priming masculinity results in unhealthy
food preferences [53]. When the packaging and
Tannenbaum et al. BMC Medical Research Methodology  (2016) 16:145 
Page 4 of 9
 healthiness of the food are gender congruent (i.e.,
feminine packaging for a healthy food, masculine
packaging for an unhealthy food) both male and
female participants rate the product as more
attractive, report that they would be more likely
to purchase it, and even rate it as tasting better
compared to when the product is stereotype
incongruent.
4. When negative or harmful gender stereotypes
may impede the uptake and outcomes of an IRP
initiative [54]. A realist review of the implementation
of school-based interventions to prevent domestic
abuse for children and young people reported that
lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender youth felt
excluded from the programmes, as the content did
not address gender identity or sexual orientation in
high-risk populations [55]. Similarly, data suggest
that masculine norms around emotional control
and self-reliance are associated with recurrent non-
suicidal self-injury [56]. Stigma related to healthcare
seeking for male depression and suicide [57, 58],
may explain why women are more likely to benefit
from psychosocial treatment for the prevention of
suicide and suicidal ideation compared to men [59].
Some studies purport that gender bias in prescription
patterns among health care providers results in more
women receiving treatment with antidepressants
for mental health [60] and pain symptoms, but only
among female clinicians [61]. Men, on the other hand,
may be preferentially managed with orthopaedic
surgery to manage knee arthritis [62].
5. When gendered power relations may inadvertently
skew the uptake of information focused on women’s
health needs, such as maternal and child health,
sexual and reproductive health, or family planning
[63]. This occurs in cultures and settings where
male partners and head of households play a large
role in female’s health-seeking behaviour due to their
authority and decision-making role. For example,
the introduction of health programs enhanced by
mobile phone technologies overall fosters women’s
empowerment in low-income countries [64].
However, in some cases these programs exacerbated
gender relations and gender inequalities, such as
when women were pressured to give the phones
provided by the program to their husband if he did
not already own a phone, or when conflicts about
phone use led to cases of spousal abuse.
The World Health Organization outlines a spectrum
of gender-responsive programs, illustrating the progres-
sion from the exploitative use of gender stereotypes in
IRP messaging, through to accommodation and ultimate
transformation to gender equity (Fig. 1) [65, 66]. Making
active choices reflecting content, messaging and decision-
making processes during the implementation of an inter-
vention can have a critical impact on gender equity for
women and men. Gender transformative approaches are
preferred as they anticipate unintended barriers and con-
sequences and address the causes of gender-based health
inequities where they exist [67]. For example, during im-
plementation of a tobacco control program, investigators
can decide to use motivational recruitment techniques
that appeal to a person’s health and self-respect, as
opposed to messaging that invokes and reinforces stereo-
typical gendered norms of sexual attractiveness, beauty
claims or images based on masculinity or femininity [63].
Recent guidance based on qualitative research suggests

 de-linking messages for men and for women when pro-
moting tobacco reduction during pregnancy and post par-
tum, since the uptake of the intervention can be hindered
by negative couple dynamics if the partners have different
smoking behaviours or attitudes about smoking during
this period [68–70]. Another transformative approach to
encourage uptake of smoking cessation interventions
would be to focus on a wider range of non-stereotypical
gendered roles that include fathering for men and work
for women as potential motivators.
Sex and gender can be therefore be pivotal at multiple
points along the IRP process, from the content and mes-
saging surrounding the intervention, to decision making
around the uptake and unintended consequences of an
intervention. Asking sex and gender questions can also
elucidate enablers and barriers to the adoption of com-
plex behavioral interventions. For example, examining
the outcome of implementing a multidisciplinary cardiac
rehabilitation program merits asking whether women or
men have less time to devote to recovery and prevention
activities due to gender-based expectations regarding
their responsibilities at home. The potential advantages
of including sex and gender in the study of other complex
behavioral interventions (e.g., hand hygiene, reducing
clinician's opioid prescribing, reducing falls in hospital,
increasing vaccination rates, and obesity prevention) re-
quire further investigation. Measuring the way sex and
gender influences these interventions may help elucidate
potential mechanisms and contexts behind the success
or failure of various IRP efforts, as shown in the examples
above on tobacco cessation, healthy eating, depression
and suicide, pain, heart disease and domestic violence.
Some research questions to drive the selection of methods
Researchers can start by asking a series of questions
about how sex and gender can have an impact on their
implementation initiative in order to determine the best
way to measure and analyze the effect of sex and gender.
First, how might sex or gender affect decision-making
and stakeholder engagement, or facilitate or impede the
uptake of evidence-informed practice, programs, pol-
icies? Second, how might sex based characteristics or
prevailing gender norms or gender roles serve as barriers
or enablers to the uptake of evidence-informed practices,
programs, policies? Third, when and how should the
communication strategy, wording or messaging be tai-
lored across sex, gender or other identity characteristics?
Fourth, when using participatory/collaborative or inte-
grated knowledge translation research approaches, could
the sex and gender of the researchers and knowledge
users matter, and if so, how? Similarly, how might
gender relations as a function of dyads or interpersonal
dynamics within an organization, community, workplace
or institution influence the outcome of the intervention?
And finally, should the research protocol consider exam-
ining whether there are unintended impacts of implemen-
tation that exacerbate or diminish sex, gender or other
diversity-related inequities? Table 2 lists a series of ques-
tions for researchers to consider when designing their IRP
research. Additional opportunities for integrating sex and
gender in IRP as relates to models of health systems
research have been reviewed in detail elsewhere [33].
Another way to study issues of sex and gender in IRP
resides in the realist approach which attempts to
answer the question, “What works, for whom, in what
circumstances, and why?” [47] This is accomplished
through the identification and examination of underlying
generative mechanisms or program theories associated
with the implementation intervention or program, the
conditions or contexts under which the mechanisms
operate, and the pattern of outcomes produced. Realist
evaluators
may
wish
to
examine
sex
and
gender
through the lens of this Context-Mechanism-Outcomes
configuration for the evaluation of new initiatives, pro-
grams and scale-up [71, 72].
Through this lens, context can be defined as the particu-
lar sub-groups for whom the outcomes were successful,
the gender relations between the stakeholders, the sex
and/or gender of the individuals who implemented the
Table 2 Some sex and gender research questions for
researchers studying implementation
• Are theories of behaviour change (i.e. processes of reasoning or reflection)
equally applicable across sexes, genders and other intersecting variables?
• How does consideration of sex, gender and diversity affect the
assessing of barriers and supports to uptake of evidence-informed
practice, programs, policies?
• How do prevailing gender norms or gender roles serve as barriers or
enablers to the uptake of evidence-informed practices, programs, policies?
• When and how should implementation interventions be tailored to
the sex, gender and diversity of the target audience?
• Do cognitive and emotional learning strategies differ across sexes or
genders, and if so how?
• When and how should the wording or messaging included in the
implementation intervention be tailored differently across sex, gender
and other identity characteristics?
• How does the implementation intervention increase or decrease
gender inequities in socio-economic status, cultural or ethnic groups,
and political contexts?
• Does the implementation intervention work differently for sub-groups
of men, women and gender-diverse people, and if so, how?
• When using participatory/collaborative or integrated knowledge
translation research approaches, does the sex and gender of the
researchers and knowledge users matter, and if so, how?
• How do gender relations as a function of dyads or interpersonal
dynamics within an organization, community, workplace or institution
influence the outcome of the intervention?
• Are there unintended impacts of implementation that exacerbate or
diminish sex, gender or other diversity-related inequities?

 intervention, and the institutional, socio-economic, cul-
tural and political conditions. Mechanism refers to the
explanation of how a particular program’s resources
work to change the reasoning and responses of partici-
pants to bring about the adoption of the clinical inter-
vention or program that results in both intended and
unintended outcomes. Outcomes are the impacts of the
intervention. Some questions of how sex and gender
considerations can align with the Context-Mechanism-
Outcomes configuration are: How do gender roles,
gender identity, gender relations, and institutionalized
gender influence the way in which an implementation
strategy works, for whom, under what circumstances
and why? Or, how do program theories operate/work
within and across sexes, genders and other diversity
characteristics, in what circumstances and why? Finally,
research results should be disaggregated and reported
by sex or gender groups [11]. It is important to report
whether there are similar effects or differences.
When critically appraising the publications of imple-
mentation research, reviewers should increasingly ask
whether the reports consider sex and gender during a
study’s life cycle, and if so, how? Table 3 provides a
beginning list of questions that can be asked of imple-
mentation research to help the reader assess whether
sex and gender have been adequately considered, and
the extent to which this may have influenced the study
findings and conclusions.
Conclusion
This paper argues that sex and gender should always be
considered in implementation research. Considering sex
and gender should be an essential component of IRP.
Failing to integrate sex and gender may neglect an
important determinant of knowledge use, reducing the
effectiveness of implementation interventions, inadvert-
ently reinforcing sex neutral claims and negative gender
stereotypes, and possibly creating or increasing gender
and health inequities in care and health outcomes. Only
by consistently investigating sex and gender in a critical
and reflective manner that addresses underlying gender
inequities, will the field of IRP reach its full potential
for meeting the requirements of scientific rigour, excel-
lence and maximal impact.

Table 3 Questions to ask when appraising an implementation
research or practice initiative for inclusion of sex and gender
considerations
• Has the systematic review of the effectiveness of implementation
interventions considered evidence related to sex and gender?
• Has the literature review and analysis of the know-do-gap considered
gender roles, gender identity, gender relations, institutionalized gender?
• Does the monitoring and evaluation plan for the intervention collect
data on sex, gender and diverse factors, and include a strategy for
assessing and mitigating inequitable outcomes?
• Has the assessment of barriers and facilitators of the use of evidence-
informed practices, programs, policies considered gender roles, gender
identity, gender relations, institutionalized gender?
• Has the process by which local or targeted adaptation of the evidence-
informed practices, programs, policies considered cultural contexts of
gender roles, gender identity, gender relations, institutionalized gender?
• Has the implementation intervention been tailored to address sex,
gender or other identity or diversity-related characteristics identified
in the barriers assessment?
• Has knowledge use (uptake of the practice, program, policy) been
reported by sex, gender, and other population characteristics such
as age, socioeconomic status etc?
• Have health outcomes (impact of adopting the practice, program, policy)
been reported by sex, gender, and other population characteristics?
• Has the impact of unintended consequences of implementation been
reported by sex, gender, and other population characteristics?
