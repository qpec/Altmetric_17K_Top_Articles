Abstract
Background: The experience from clinical trials indicates that anti-Aβ immunotherapy could be effective in early/
pre-clinical stages of AD, whereas at the late stages promoting the clearing of Aβ alone may be insufficient to halt
the disease progression. At the same time, pathological tau correlates much better with the degree of dementia
than Aβ deposition. Therefore, targeting pathological tau may provide a more promising approach for the treatment of
advanced stages of AD. Recent data demonstrates that the N-terminal region of tau spanning aa 2–18 termed
“phosphatase activation domain” that is normally hidden in the native protein in ‘paperclip’-like conformation,
becomes exposed in pathological tau and plays an essential role in the inhibition of fast axonal transport and in
aggregation of tau. Hence, we hypothesized that anti-Tau2–18 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) may recognize
pathological, but not normal tau at very early stages of tauopathy and prevent or decrease the aggregation of
this molecule.
Methods: Mouse mAbs were generated using standard hybridoma methodology. CDR grafting was used for
humanization of mouse mAb. Humanized mAb (Armanezumab) was characterized and tested in vitro/ex vivo/in
vivo using biochemical and immunological methods (HPLC, Biacore, ELISA, IHC, FRET, etc.). Stable DG44 cell line
expressing Armanezumab was generated by clone selection with increased concentrations of methotrexate (MTX).
Results: A panel of mouse mAbs was generated, clone 1C9 was selected based on binding to pathological human tau
with high affinity and humanized. Fine epitope mapping revealed conservation of the epitope of human tau
recognized by the parent murine mAb and Armanezumab. Importantly, Armanezumab (i) bound to tau with high
affinity as determined by Biacore; (ii) bound pathological tau in brains from AD, FTD and Pick’s disease cases; (iii)
inhibited seeding effect of aggregated tau from brain lysate of P301S Tg mice; (iv) inhibited cytotoxic effect of
tau oligomers; (v) reduced total tau (HT7) and AT100, PHF1, AT8, AT180, p212, p214-positive tau species in brains
of tau transgenic mice after intracranial injection. A stable CHO cell line producing >1.5 g/l humanized mAb,
Armanezumab was generated.
Conclusion: These findings suggest that Armanezumab could be therapeutic in clinical studies for treatment of AD.

 Background
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of
dementia worldwide. Compared to other deadly diseases,
Alzheimer’s is the only disease that cannot yet be pre-
vented, cured or slowed down. While death rates for
other major diseases, such as heart diseases, cancer,
AIDS etc., have declined, death rates from Alzheimer’s
disease have risen by 71% since 2000 (www.alz.org).
Since the “amyloid cascade hypothesis” was proposed, a
primary focus of therapeutic approaches for AD have in-
volved reducing amyloid-β (Aβ) levels in the brain [1, 2].
Anti-Aβ immunotherapy is considered as one of the
most promising AD treatments under investigation, as it
is currently being tested in many clinical trials [3–7].
Unfortunately, none of the attempts reported to date
have shown positive clinical outcome in pivotal phase 3
trials. However, lessons learned from these trials indicate
that, primarily, to be effective, anti-Aβ immunotherapy
should be initiated before cognitive decline and severe
pathological changes have occurred. Secondly, clearing
Aβ at the late stages may be insufficient to halt the pro-
gression of AD. According to multiple reports, tau
pathology correlates much better with the degree of
dementia than Aβ plaque burden [8–14]. Targeting tau
is now considered a promising approach for treatment
of advanced AD stages. Additionally, tau is a common
pathological
marker
for
several
neurodegenerative
disorders collectively referred to as tauopathies, e.g.
frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to
chromosome 17 (FTDP-17) and Pick’s disease, corticoba-
sal degeneration, progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP),
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), guam parkinsonism
dementia complex, and dementia pugilistica. Therefore,
development of safe and effective immunotherapy target-
ing pathological tau may become universal for the treat-
ment of many diseases.
In this study, we generated and characterized mono-
clonal humanized version of a select mouse antibodies
targeting a non-phospho-epitope located in N-terminal
region of tau spanning aa 2–18 (tau2-18, known as PAD,
phosphatase activation domain). This domain is nor-
mally hidden in a paperclip-like conformation of native
protein, but becomes exposed in aggregated pathological
tau [15]. It has been shown that exposed PAD plays an
important role in the inhibition of anterograde fast
axonal transport (FAT) as well as in polymerization of
tau [16–21]. Immunohistochemical studies of human
postmortem tissues and immunoreactivity with AD
brain extracts with PAD specific antibodies (TNT-1)
demonstrated that exposure of N-terminal region of Tau
(TNT-1 immunoreactivity) is an early event in AD that
is becoming more and more revealed in the severe stages
of AD [16, 20–22]. Importantly, it was shown that
appoptosin-mediated caspase-3 activation observed in
several chronic neurodegenerative diseases including
PSP, AD, FTD-T,HD, and PD, leads to tau cleavage at
D421 [23–25]. Cleaved c-Tau is more prone to form ag-
gregates/fibrils [25–29], associates with both early and
late markers of NFTs in AD and is correlated with cog-
nitive decline [29], strongly supporting the strategy
aimed to target N-terminus of Tau exposed in caspase-
cleaved c-Tau. Recently Bright et al. demonstrated the
presence of extracellular N-terminal tau fragments se-
creted by iPSC cortical neurons from AD patients. Based
on in vitro data they suggested that secreted extracellu-
lar Tau negatively impacts the neurons by inducing their
hyperactivity and may elevate Aβ production in AD
brain [30]. It is assumed that neutralization of these spe-
cies can potentially slow the clinical progression of
dementia.
Based on above mentioned data we hypothesized that
antibodies generated against tau2–18 epitope may recognize
pathological, but not normal tau at the early stages of
tauopathy, and prevent/decrease the polymerization of this
molecule.
We report the discovery of mouse mAbs targeting N-
terminus of Tau leading to generation and characterization
of a humanized anti-tau antibody, and culminating with
development of a CHO cell line producing >1.5 g/l of this
therapeutically potent Mab. Humanized antibody was
termed Armanezumab according to “Programme on
International Nonproprietary Names (INN), Quality
Assurance and Safety: Medicines, Essential Medicines
and Pharmaceutical Policies (EMP)” of WHO. Pending
safety and therapeutic efficacy assessment, Armanezu-
mab could be a candidate for clinical trials in mild to
moderate AD patients.
Results
Generation of the precursor mouse antibody
A panel of monoclonal antibodies (mAb) were generated
after immunization of mice with vaccine targeting epi-
tope tau2–18 based on our proprietary MultiTEP plat-
form (AV-1980R), which is highly immunogenic in mice,
rabbits and monkeys [31–34]. Mice immunized with
AV-1980R formulated with Quil-A adjuvant generated
high titers of anti-tau antibodies that recognized not
only tau2–18 peptide, but also full length human 4R/0N
tau. Splenocytes from immunized mice were used for
generation of hybridomas secreting monoclonal anti-
bodies. After screening of 28 hybridoma clones for their
ability to bind with full length tau and pathological tau
by IHC to brains of patients with severe AD cases, clone
1C9
was
selected
for
further
characterization
and
humanization.
Fine epitope mapping of 1C9 antibody by alanine
scanning demonstrated that substitution of residues 4–8
at the N-terminus of Tau to alanine effects the ability of

 antibody to bind to the peptide tau2–18, mapping the
1C9 epitope to PRQEF. Substitutions 6Q/A and 7E/A
completely abrogated the competing ability of the pep-
tides in competitive ELISA, showing that 6Q/7E are the
most essential amino acids for binding to the antibody
(Fig. 1a). Interestingly, substitutions of amino acids 9–18
slightly improved the binding ability of peptides, perhaps
by promoting better exposure of the epitope by changing
the structure of peptide. Specificity testing showed that
this novel antibody recognized full-length recombinant
tau, but not tau that lacks tau2–18 domain in western
blot (Fig. 1b). 1C9 mAb bound different forms of recom-
binant tau: monomeric, oligomeric and fibrillar tau in
dot blot assay (Fig. 1c). More importantly, 1C9 mAb rec-
ognized pathological tau (both neuropil threads and
NFT) in the fixed brain sections from AD cases (Fig. 1d).
Of note, 1C9 did not bind to the brain sections from a
non-AD subject. In denaturing conditions of western
blot 1C9 bound different forms of tau in homogenates
of postmortem AD and control brains (Fig. 1e) showing a
typical pattern as in case of HT7 antibodies recognizing
total tau (see Fig. 3b). In contrast, in non-denaturing dot
blot assay 1C9 selectively bound to soluble fraction of
postmortem AD brain extracts (Fig. 1f) indicating that
PAD is more exposed and accessible in the AD brains as
opposed to controls.

region framework residues (as described in Materials
and Methods). The reshaped, humanized antibody only
retains essential binding elements from the murine anti-
body (5–10% of total sequence) and is predicted to

 generate only minimal immune responses in passively vac-
cinated subjects compared to chimeric human-mouse
antibody (with replaced murine constant regions by hu-
man constant regions), which bears around 30% of ori-
ginal murine sequence [35]. The phage clone-producing
antibody with the highest tau binding affinity was selected
for expression as full antibody. Fc fragment of heavy chain
of 1C9 was completely replaced with human IgG1 Fc frag-
ment in the humanized version and the expressed human-
ized antibody, designated Armanezumab was purified for
further analyses. Armanezumab was examined in SDS-
PAGE (Fig. 2a) and HPLC (Fig. 2b), the latter analyses
showed that its purity reached 99%.
It is known that CDR grafting may alter the antibody’s
binding capacity to the target antigen, so we compared
binding affinity of Armanezumab with parental 1C9
mouse mAb measuring the equilibrium dissociation con-
stant (KD) of both antibodies for binding to recombinant
tau by SPR. As shown in Fig. 2c, the affinity of binding
of humanized Ab is only slightly lower than mouse par-
ental 1C9 mAb: KD (M) of Armanezumab is 3.88E-08,
while KD (M) of 1C9 is 9.51E-09 (Fig. 2c). This differ-
ence between the affinities of binding of 1C9 mAb and
Armanezumab is within the range observed for human-
ized antibodies compared with their parent mouse version.
Fine epitope mapping of Armanezumab also showed

specificity of the antibody, except that IC50 for peptides
with substitutions 4P/A and 8 F/A was higher indicating
the importance of these amino acids for binding with
Armanezumab (Fig. 3a).
Functional characterization of Armanezumab
The functionality of Armanezumab was investigated
using different approaches.
Binding of Armanezumab to pathological tau
Our data showed that like 1C9, Armanezumab bound to
full-length recombinant tau, monomeric and aggregated
forms of tau in AD brain extracts and did not recognize
recombinant tauΔ2-18 (Fig. 3b). It labels the similar pat-
tern of tau protein as HT7 recognizing total tau. In con-
trast
to
commercial
PAD-specific
antibody
TNT-1,
Armanezumab bound also the aggregated forms of tau
in brain extracts from AD patients. Importantly, Arma-
nezumab recognized pathological tau in cortices not
only from AD cases but also from Frontotemporal De-
mentia and Pick’s Disease, similarly to other antibodies
specific to pathological or total tau, such as PHF1, AT8,
AT100, HT7 and TNT-1. No binding was detected in
control cortices from non-demented subjects (Fig. 4).
Armanezumab Inhibits seeding activity of aggregated tau
To assess a relevant therapeutic activity of Armanezumab
we used cellular model that assays the seeding activity of
pathological tau [36]. Previously it was demonstrated that
fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay
could be used to track the aggregation of aggregation-
prone tau containing P301S mutation in its repeat domain
(RD) in HEK293 cells co-transfected with RD-CFP and
RD-YFP [36, 37].
More vigorous aggregation could be induced by add-
ing brain lysate from P301S Tg mice containing full-
length tau aggregates to the culture of co-transfected
cells. Here we tested the ability of Armanezumab to in-

 aggregation of tau RD containing mutations P301S and
ΔK280. As shown in Fig. 5, addition of untreated brain
lysate of P301S Tg mice to the transiently transfected
cells expressing RD(ΔK280)-CFP/YFP increased the in-
tegrated FRET-density, whereas pre-treating brain lys-
ate with Armanezumab inhibited such induction. In
another experimental setting, we used monoclonal
HEK293T cell lines that constitutively express tau re-
peat domain (RD) containing P301S mutation tagged to
either CFP or YFP. We demonstrated that precipitation
of tau from brain lysate with Armanezumab immobi-
lized on Protein G agarose significantly decreased a
capacity of brain lysate to induce aggregation of RD-
CFP/YFP in these cells and decreased the integrated
FRET density (Fig. 6a). Representative WB demonstrat-
ing the depletion of tau from brain lysate by immuno-
precipitation with Armanezumab/Protein G complex is
shown in Fig. 6b. Obviously, in stably transfected cells
all of which express RD-CFP/YFP, the number of FRET
positive cells, and therefore integrated FRET density, is
higher than in transiently transfected cells shown in
Fig. 5. These data demonstrated therapeutic potency of
Armanezumab, that could not only bind pathological
human tau from the brains of Tg mice, but also block
seeding activity of aggregated molecules in this in vitro
assays.
Armanezumab inhibits tau cytotoxicity
To check the ability of Armanezumab to inhibit neuro-
toxicity of tau aggregates, we performed cytotoxicity as-
says to determine whether Armanezumab could protect
SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells as well as mouse
primary neurons from tau oligomer-mediated neurotox-
icity. As seen in Fig. 7, oligomeric tau protein was

 cytotoxic, reducing neuroblastoma cell viability to 36%
and primary neurons viability to 30%, compared to the
untreated cells. Pre-incubation of tau oligomers with
Armanezumab protected cells from the cytotoxic effects
of oligomeric forms of tau, with cell viability reaching 89%
and 100% for SH-SY5Y cells and primary neurons, re-
spectively. Of note, the pre-incubation of oligomers with
an irrelevant control IgG did not protect neuroblastoma
cells or primary neurons from cytotoxicity of this protein
(Fig. 7). These data demonstrated potential therapeutic ac-
tivity of Armanezumab and support testing in in vivo.
Armanezumab reduced tau in brains of tau/Tg mice
To demonstrate the therapeutic activity in vivo, Armane-
zumab was unilaterally injected into the brains of aged
THY-Tau22 Tg mice with tauopathy. Changes in tau
pathology were analyzed in brains of mice on the 5th
day after antibody administration. Analyses of tau im-
munoreactivity revealed a substantial decrease of total
tau, and tau phosphorylated at positions Thr212, Ser214,
Ser396/404 (PHF1), Thr212/Ser214 (AT100), Thr231
(AT180), Ser202/Thr205 (AT8) in ipsilateral hemisphere
injected with Armanezumab versus the contralateral
hemisphere injected with irrelevant human IgG1 (Fig. 8).
Of note, this comparison is based on quantitative image
analysis of regions of hippocampus into which anti-
bodies diffused after the administration. These areas
were determined by additional staining for human IgG
in the adjacent brain sections of mice (data not shown).
Additional staining with anti-NeuN antibody confirmed
neuronal integrity in the areas around the injection sites
(data not shown). These data suggest that Armanezumab
is able to significantly reduce pathological tau in the
brains of tau/Tg mice with established tauopathy after
intracranial administration.

 Pharmacokinetics of Armanezumab in mice and
development of industrial cell line
PK analyses of Armanezumab in wildtype mice, in the
absence of target-mediated clearance and in Tg mouse
model expressing human tau, was conducted after the
administration of a single dose of Armanezumab via IV
bolus injection to C57BL6 and PS19 tau/Tg mice. The
concentration of Armanezumab was monitored from
day 1 through day 54 following the injection. No differ-
ences were observed in the serum concentration x time
profiles of Armanezumab in WT and PS19 mice (Fig. 9).
In both strains the peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of
Armanezumab was observed at day 1, and the average
elimination half-life is 9 days (Table in Fig. 9). The rate at
which Armanezumab is removed from the system [Elim-
ination rate (Kel) constant and the estimated clearance
(CL)] also did not differ between strains indicating that
the elimination was not target-mediated. The apparent
volume of distribution is 2.93 and 2.70 in Tg and wild-
type mice, respectively, indicating that Armanezumab was
mostly distributed in blood in both strains of mice.
Based on data generated in the studies described above,
a stable CHO‐DG44 cell line expressing quantities of
Armanezumab amenable to scale-up production (1.5 g/L),
was developed using MTX amplification.
Discussion
Although Aβ may be the primary trigger in AD patho-
genesis, it is clear that pathological tau also plays an
important role in AD [38]. By the time the clinical signs
of AD appear first, there is already substantial tau path-
ology in the brain [39, 40], which may become self-
propagating [41–44]. Observations showed that tau
oligomers are directly toxic to neurons, and tau path-
ology better correlates with clinical cognitive decline in
AD [14, 45, 46]. Therefore, several groups have proposed
anti-tau immunotherapy (passive and active vaccinations)
as an effective therapeutic approach [4, 47–49].
Importantly, therapeutics aimed at eliminating patho-
logical tau may also be beneficial for treatment of a
group of neurodegenerative disorders other than AD,
categorized as tauopathies. These diseases include ALS,
FTD with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17, Pick’s
Disease, PSP, Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, Dementia Pugi-
listica, Down’s Syndrome and others.
Tau-targeting immunotherapy was questioned initially
due to the intracellular nature of tau protein. However,
data demonstrating that during disease progression in
humans tau-related pathology spreads from the affected
areas of the brain to the healthy regions [50], and the
discovery of trans-cellular propagation of tau aggregates
[51–55] suggested a possible mechanism of action for
antibody-mediated reduction of tau pathology observed
in mouse models, and supported the feasibility of using
anti-tau immunotherapy in a clinical setting. Although
the exact mechanism of antibody-mediated reduction of
pathological tau is currently unknown, several studies
suggest different mechanisms of action, possibly depend-
ing on the particular antibody, as well as type and size of
tau aggregates [56–61]. Recently it was shown that tau
aggregates-antibody complexes taken up by cultured
neuronal cells bind to cytosolic protein TRIM21 that
triggered clearance of tau particles [58]. A mechanism of
action where neuronal FcγRs mediate antibody uptake
by neurons, followed by engagement of intracellular tau
tangles by the internalized antibody, has been proposed
[56, 57]. Another suggested mechanism is that anti-
bodies bind extracellular Tau and prevent its uptake by
adjacent or post-synaptic neurons [59, 60]. It is also
shown that anti-tau antibodies can promote microglial
uptake and clearance of tau [59, 61], although, recently
another group reported that effector function is not re-
quired for antibody efficacy [60].

 An early
immunotherapeutic study showed that
immunization of wild type mice with recombinant
full-length tau is not entirely safe, and tau-specific
polyclonal
antibodies
induced
NFT-like
pathology,
glial activation, axonal damage, and even infiltration of
mononuclear cells into the brains [62]. However, sev-
eral subsequent studies utilizing both passive vaccina-
tions [43, 57, 63–72] and short peptide-based active
vaccinations [73–79] targeting various phosphorylated,
non-modified linear or conformational epitopes of tau
showed that these antibodies are safe and efficacious
for
reducing
tau
pathology
and
improving
tau-
associated functional deficits in tau/Tg mouse models.
Currently, two active vaccines (AADvac1 [80, 81] and
ACI-35 [79]) are being tested in clinical trials with AD
patients, and two humanized versions of anti-tau anti-
bodies have been reported to have advanced to clinical
testing in subjects with progressive supranuclear palsy
(NCT02494024, NCT02460094, NCT02658916).
In this study, we report a discovery and characterization
of a humanized antibody targeting N-terminal region of
tau, which, after successful preclinical safety studies will be
ready to advance into clinical testing. As our starting point,
a mouse mAb was selected based on the ability of binding
to recombinant tau with high affinity, as well as binding to
oligomeric/fibrillar tau in brain homogenates and NT/NFT
in the brain tissue from AD cases. Importantly, our data re-
veals this mAb’s high specificity to pathological tau species
characterized by an accessible N-terminal region, and it’s
inability to effectively bind normally folded tau in non-
diseased brain. Translation of monoclonal antibodies to a
clinical setting requires humanization to make them non-
immunogenic or at least less immunogenic in humans. For
humanization of mouse mAb 1C9, we adopted an approach

 involving CDR-grafting into selected human frameworks
from human Immunoglobulin Germline V gene database
based on similarity to the parent mouse mAb, combined
with phage display to identify the optimal humanized vari-
ant. Constructs encoding humanized VH and VL were
fused with constant regions from IgG1 human immuno-
globulin to generate full human antibody. The optimal hu-
manized antibody (Armanezumab) was characterized in
different in vitro/ex vivo and in vivo assays to test for activ-
ity relative to the parent mouse mAb. We demonstrated
that Armanezumab (i) possesses a tau-binding affinity,
which is only slightly lower than parental mouse mAb 1C9;
(ii) recognizes the same tau4–8 epitope as 1C9; (iii) effi-
ciently binds to pathological tau in brain sections from AD,
FTD, Pick’s Disease cases, without binding to brain sections
from control non-demented subjects; (iv) significantly in-
hibits the seeding ability of misfolded tau in brain extracts
from P301S Tg as evidenced by decreasing integrated FRET
density in a cellular assay of tau aggregation; (v) Inhibits
neurotoxic effects of aggregated tau; vi) acutely reduces tau
pathology following intracranial administration in Tau Tg
mice.
In addition, pharmacokinetics analysis of Armanezu-
mab revealed no differences in clearance rates from the
blood circulation of wildtype and tau/Tg PS19 mice, with
about 9 days of half-life in both strains. This similarity
in pharmacokinetics of mouse and humanized Mab
could be explained by negligible concentrations of tau
protein in blood of tau transgenic mice that express hu-
man tau selectively in neurons, leading to the same non-
target-mediated profile of elimination seen in wild-type
mice. Despite in general higher binding affinity of hu-
man Fc-fragment to mouse neonatal FcRn [82], half-life
of Armanezumab is close to theoretical mouse IgG half-
life. In fact, it was shown that higher affinity for FcRn
does not correlate with extended in vivo half-lives of
antibodies [83].
Recently, various groups developed antibodies specific
to different epitopes located at N-terminal region of Tau.
It was demonstrated that both intracerebroventricular
infusion and peripheral administration of antibodies spe-
cific to Tau25–30 are therapeutic in P301S mouse model
of tauopathy [43, 72], although very high concentration
(50 mg/kg) of systemically administered (i.p.) antibodies
are needed to achieve significant decrease in insoluble
tau, prevent brain atrophy, and see improvement of
motor/sensorimotor function [72]. On the other hand,
intravenous injection of only 15 μg (~750 μg/kg) of anti-
body specific to Tau6–18 markedly reduced tau pathology
and rescued cognitive impairment of vaccinated 3xTg-
AD mice [69, 84]. Such large differences in effective dose
of above mentioned antibodies could be attributable to

 differences in administration route, targeted epitope or
the aggressiveness of mouse model of tauopathy. This
assumption is supported by another study showing that
single i.v. administration of 60 μg antibodies specific to
oligomeric tau for 60 d was sufficient to reverse both
locomotor and memory deficits in a not very aggressive
Htau mouse model of tauopathy [85].
Overall, these data suggest that ideally various routes
of delivery, variable doses and different mouse models
should be tested to properly assess the antibody’s ability
to reduce the tau pathology. However, even after such
careful testing it is difficult to predict the efficacy of
antibodies in humans. The majority of mouse models of
tauopathies constitutively overexpress mutated human
tau and rapidly develop severe pathology, although not
completely resembling human disease. We believe that
the modest efficacy of many anti-tau antibodies cur-
rently tested in preclinical studies might be associated
with very low amount of antibody reaching CNS for
clearing
such
severe
pathology.
Therefore,
various
groups suggest testing the efficacy of anti-tau biologics
and drugs in in vitro or ex vivo experimental systems
such as (i) reduction of aggregation of tau; (ii) inhibition
of toxicity of oligomeric tau and inhibition of propaga-
tion of tau [86]. As mentioned above, the efficacy of
Armanezumab was shown in all these assays, therefore,
to save time and reduce the cost of non-clinical studies
we decided to evaluate the ability of Armanezumab to
reduce pathological tau after intracranial injection of
mice. These in vivo data demonstrated that 2 μg/mouse
of Armanezumab in 5 days could reduce not only total
tau, but also various pathological tau molecules phos-
phorylated at positions S212, S214, Ser396/404 (PHF1),
Thr212/Ser214
(AT100),
Thr231
(AT180),
Ser202/
Thr205 (AT8). Fine epitope mapping revealed the epi-
tope PRQEF at positions tau 4–8 with the most essential
amino acids at positions 6&7, indicating that Armanezu-
mab is different from antibodies specific to N-terminal
tau region reported previously by other groups [43, 69].
Based on the fact that only a tiny amount of circulating
antibody passes the BBB and enters the brain [87–89]
we think that more feasible route of administration for
antibodies might be intranasal route as a non-invasive
and efficient approach of delivering therapeutics to the
brain that circumvents systemic extraction/alteration
[90, 91].
Conclusions
Overall, we have generated and successfully human-
ized a murine mAb specific to N-terminus of tau
protein. The humanized antibody, designated Arma-
nezumab, recognized NTs and NFTs in brain tissue
from AD, FTD and Pick’s Disease cases, inhibited
seeding activity and neurotoxicity of aggregated tau
and reduced pathological tau in brains of THY-
Tau22 transgenic mice. A CHO cell line expressing
Armanezumab amenable to scale up production (1–
2 g/L) has been developed to support IND enabling
studies with Armanezumab, as well as advancement
to phase 1 clinical testing.
Methods
Mice, peptide epitope vaccine, and immunizations
Female, 6–8 weeks old B6SJL (H-2bxs haplotype) and
PS19 Tau/Tg mice were obtained from the Jackson
Laboratory. THY-Tau22 Tau/Tg mice (generous gift of
Dr. Luc Buee, Inserm) were bred at UCI animal facility.
All animals were housed in a temperature and light-
cycle controlled facility, and their care was under the
guidelines of the National Institutes of Health and an
approved IACUC protocol at University of California,
Irvine. B6SJL mice were immunized with MultiTEP
platform-based vaccine, AV-1980R, as previously de-
scribed [92]. Briefly, mice were injected subcutaneously
(SC) with 50 μg/mouse dose of AV-1980R formulated in
Quil-A adjuvant (Sigma-Aldrich, MA). All mice were
boosted at 2-week intervals. Sera were collected on day
12 after each immunization. Mice were terminated 4 days
after the 4th immunization and splenocytes were used
for fusion and selection of hybridomas producing anti-
Tau antibodies.
Peptides were synthesized by standard chemical pep-
tide synthesis and purity was analyzed by HPLC (Gen-
Script, NJ).
Generation of hybridoma
Mouse
spleen

aseptically
removed,
cells
were
washed out from the spleen by perfusion with 10 ml of
sterile serum-free DMEM/F12. Splenocyte suspension
was passed through sterile Falcon 0.70 μm cell filter
followed by two wash steps. Splenocytes were fused with
SP2/0 myeloma (Sp2/0-Ag14 ATCC® CRL-1581) cells
per standard protocols and selected in HAT media.
Hybridoma supernatants were screened by ELISA for re-
activity with tau2–18 peptide. Positive hybridomas were
subcloned by limiting dilution. Fusion procedure and
subcloning
have
been
performed
in
Recombinant
Protein Production Core (rPPC), CLP at Northwestern
University.
Twenty-eight
clones
were
selected
and
screened for binding to brain sections from the AD case.
Clone 1C9 has been selected and used for further
characterization and humanization.
Monoclonal antibody sequencing
Total RNA was isolated from hybridoma cells following
the technical manual of TRIzol® Plus RNA Purification
System and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis.

ScriptTM III First-Strand Synthesis System. The anti-
body fragments of VH, VL, CH and CL were amplified
according to the standard operating procedure for
RACE at GenScript (Genscript, Piscataway, NJ). Amp-
lified antibody fragments were separately cloned into a
standard cloning
vector using standard molecular
cloning procedures. Clones with inserts of correct
sizes were identified by PCR screening. No less than
five single colonies with inserts of correct sizes were
sequenced for each antibody fragment.
Humanization of mouse antibody
1C9 antibody was humanized by Genscript using propri-
etary
technology.
Variable
domain
sequences
were
blasted against human germline and several FR1, FR2,
and FR3 were selected independently from human FRs,
which share the highest identity with the mouse anti-
body. Selected FRs were assembled with 1C9 CDRs
using overlapping PCR and phage display library was
constructed for expression of Fab fragments. High tau
protein-binding phages were selected after three rounds
of
panning
using
Genscript’s
proprietary
FASEBA
screening methodology. Selected Fab genes were ampli-
fied from phage DNA. Genes encoding Fab were fused
with genes encoding the appropriate constant regions of
human IgG1 in order to generate whole IgG. Resulting
light chain and heavy chain constructs were cloned into
the mammalian expression vectors pcDNA3 and pGN-
M, respectively.
Purification of Armanezumab
Stable DG44 cell line expressing Armanezumab mAb
was generated by clone selection with increased concen-
trations of methotrexate (MTX). DG44 cells of selected
clone were re-suspended at a density of 5x105 cells/ml
and 600 ml of cell suspension was seeded into 1 L
shaker flasks. 10% (v/v) Feed B solution was added to
the culture on day 2, day 4, day 6, day 8. Glutamine was
added to maintain the concentration range from 1 mM
to 4 mM, and glucose was added to the culture to main-
tain the concentration range from 4 g/L to 10 g/L. Cell
counting was conducted daily to determine the cell
density and viability. The collected cell culture superna-
tants were used for purification when the cell viability
was below 50%. Cell culture broths were centrifuged and
followed by filtration. Filtered supernatant was loaded
onto Protein A CIP column 65 ml (GenScript, Cat.-
No.L00433) at 8.0 ml/min. After washing with PBS, elu-
tion with 50 mM Citric acid, pH 3.0 and neutralization
with 1 M Tris–HCl, pH 9.0, the eluted fractions were
desalted by HiPrep 26/10 Desalting column with PBS.
The purified antibody was analyzed by SDS-PAGE,
Western-blot and HPLC by using standard protocols for
molecular weight, yield and purity measurements.
Epitope mapping of tau-specific antibodies
Epitope mapping of anti-tau antibodies was performed
by “alanine scanning” using competitive ELISA. Briefly,
17 peptides spanning tau2–18 sequence, but possessing
one alanine substitution in each position were synthe-
sized. 96-well plates (Immulux HB; Dynex Technologies,
Inc., VA) were coated with 1 μg/well (in 100 μl;
Carbonate-Bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6, o/n at 4 °C) tau2–
18 peptide (GenScript, NJ). Next day coated plates were
blocked with blocking buffer (3% dry, non-fat milk in
TBST, 300 μl/well). Serial dilutions of reference wild
type (tau2–18), or mutated test peptides (corresponding
to 0.02 μM, 0.1 μM, 0.5 μM, 2.5 μM and 12.5 μM final
concentrations) were incubated with anti-tau antibodies
(0.04 mg/ml final concentration) for 1.5 h at 37 °C. After
incubation 100 μl of antibody/peptide mixture were
added into the wells. HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse
IgG (1:2500; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, PA)
in case of 1C9 and HRP-conjugated goat anti-human
IgG (1:2500; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, PA)
in case of Armanezumab were used as secondary anti-
bodies. The reaction was developed by adding 3,3’,5,5’tet-
ramethylbenzidine (TMB) (Pierce, IL) substrate solution
and stopped with 2 M H2SO4. The optical density (OD)
was read at 450 nm (Biotek, Synergy HT, VT). The per-
cent of binding of 1C9 and Armanezumab antibodies
blocked with wild type or mutated peptides to tau2–18
was calculated relative to the binding of 1C9 and Arma-
nezumab antibodies without competing peptides to
tau2–18 as 100%. The half maximal inhibitory concentra-
tion (IC50) for each peptide was calculated by Excel.
Recombinant tau protein preparation
Gene encoding 0N4R tau protein was amplified from
human whole brain Marathon®-Ready cDNA library
(Clontech)
using
primers
5’-catatggctgagccccgccag-
gagttcgaagtgatg (forward) and 5’-ctcgagtcacaaaccctgcttg
gccagggaggcagac (reverse) and cloned into the pET24a +
E.coli expression vector in frame with 6xHis-tag at the
C-terminus using restriction sites NdeI and XhoI. The
sequence of the cloned tau protein was verified by DNA
sequence analysis. Gene encoding tau, containing dele-
tion of 2–18 region was amplified from plasmid carrying
full-length tau gene and cloned into the pET24a + vec-
tor. Both recombinant proteins were purified from E.
coli BL21 (DE3) cells transformed with pET24a+/tau or
pET24a+/tauΔ2–18 plasmids. Cells were grown up to
the optical density (OD) 0.7–0.8 at 600 nm in the Luria
Bertani medium containing 100 μg/ml of kanamycin.
Gene expression was induced by adding isopropyl-β-D-

 1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at a final concentration
of 1 mM and incubating for 4 h at 28 °C. Cells harvested
by centrifugation were re-suspended in the B-PER re-
agent (Pierce) disrupting the integrity of cells. NaCl was
added to a final concentration of 500 mM to the lysate
and solution was boiled for 20 min. Most of the proteins
precipitated
following
heat
denaturation,
while
tau
remained in the solution. Denatured proteins were re-
moved by centrifugation and 6xHis-tagged tau was puri-
fied from the final supernatant using Ni-NTA columns
(Qiagen, CA). Positive fractions were combined and con-
centrated by centricon filters (Millipore, MA). Concen-
trated protein fractions were analyzed by 10% Bis-Tris
gel electrophoresis (NuPAGE Novex Gel, Invitrogen,
CA) (Fig. 1).
Preparation of oligomeric and fibrillar tau
Fibrillar and oligomeric forms of tau (cross-linked and
non-cross-linked) have been kindly provided by Dr.
Kayed (UTMB Neurology). Oligomeric Tau used in
neurotoxicity assay were prepared according to protocol
described in [93], using seed oligomers obtained from
Dr. Kayed. Briefly, 7 μl of tau oligomers 0.6 mg/ml were
added to 1 ml of recombinant tau protein solution of
the same concentration and incubated for 1, 2, 4.5 and
24 h on an orbital shaker.
Preparation of human and mouse brain homogenates
Frozen blocks of post mortem human brains from AD
(Braak stage VI) and control (Braak stage 0) cases were
received from the Brain Bank and Tissue Repository,
MIND, University of California, Irvine. 0.2 g of each
brain tissue were homogenized in 0.4 ml TBS buffer
with Halt™ Protease and Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail
(100X, Thermo Scientific, CA), then centrifuged at
6400xg for 15 min at +4 °C. Supernatants were collected
and stored at−80 °C for further analysis as soluble
fractions.
Mouse brain homogenates were prepared exactly as
described in [37], More specifically, brain tissue was sus-
pended
in
10%
(wt/vol)
ice-cold
TBS
containing
cOmplete protease inhibitors (Roche). Tissue was ho-
mogenized at 4 °C using a probe sonicator (Omni Sonic
Ruptor 250) at 30% power, receiving 25 pulses. Lysates
were centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 15 min to remove cel-
lular debris and large, insoluble material. Supernatants
were aliquoted and stored at−80 °C until further use.
Western blot
Western Blot analyses of recombinant full-length 4R/
0 N tau, tauΔ2–18 and soluble fractions from brain ho-
mogenates were performed to confirm the specificity
and binding ability of 1C9 and Armanezumab to patho-
logical
human
tau.
Commercial
HT7
and
TNT-1
antibodies have been used as positive controls. Briefly,
brain homogenates containing equal amounts of total
protein in SDS sample buffer (non-reducing conditions
without heat incubation) were subjected to electrophor-
esis in 10% Bis-Tris polyacrylamide gel in MES buffer
(Invitrogen, CA), then electro-transferred onto nitrocel-
lulose membrane (GE Healthcare, NJ). The membranes
were blocked overnight with 5% fat-free dry milk in TBS
with 0.05% Tween following by detection of tau using
1C9, Armanezumab, HT7 (Life Technology, CA) or
TNT-1 (Millipore, MA) monoclonal antibody and appro-
priate HRP-conjugated secondary antibody. All primary
antibodies were used at concentration 1 μg/ml. Proteins
were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence detec-
tion using Luminol reagent (Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
CA).
Dot blot
Binding to recombinant tau
1 μl of each form of tau protein (monomeric, oligomeric
and fibrillar) was applied to nitrocellulose membrane
(GE Healthcare, NJ). The membrane was air-dried,
blocked overnight with 5% fat-free dry milk in TBS with
0.05% Tween following by detection of tau using 1C9
monoclonal antibody (1 μg/ml) and HRP-conjugated
anti-mouse secondary antibody (0.2 μg/ml).
Binding to tau in human brain tissues
Soluble fractions of brain extracts from AD cases and
controls were applied to membrane (2 μg of total protein
in 1 μl volume) and proteins were detected using mouse
1C9, TNT-1 (Millipore, MA), HT7 (Life Technology,
CA) monoclonal and rabbit polyclonal anti-Tau anti-
bodies (BioLegend, CA). All primary antibodies were
used at concentration of 1 μg/ml. Bovine anti-mouse
and mouse anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated secondary anti-
bodies were used at concentration of 0.2 μg/ml (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, CA). Proteins were visualized with
enhanced chemiluminescence detection using Luminol
reagent (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA).
Binding of Armanezumab to pathological tau in human
brain tissues
1C9 or Armanezumab (1.0 μg/ml) were tested for the
ability to bind to tau tangles in the human brain using
50 μm brain sections of formalin-fixed cortical tissues
from severe AD (inferior parietal gyrus, n = 6), FTD
(midfrontal cortex, n = 3) and Pick’s Disease (midfrontal
cortex, n = 3) cases and normal control brains (inferior
parietal gyrus, n = 2), all received from Brain Bank and
Tissue Repository, MIND, UC Irvine, using immunohis-
tochemistry as described previously [92]. A digital cam-
era (Olympus) was used to capture the representative
images at 40x (for IC9) and 60x (for Armanezumab,

Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analyses
SPR binding studies were performed on the BIAcore
T200. Antibodies were immobilized on the surface of
the biosensor chip CM5 series S (GE Healthcare)
through Fc capture. Serial dilutions of tau recombinant
protein in the running buffer containing 10 mM HEPES,
150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.005% Tween 20, pH 7.4,
were injected at 5 mL/min over immobilized antibody,
and the kinetics of binding/dissociation were measured
as a change in the SPR signal (in resonance units). Each
injection was followed by a regeneration step consisting
of a 12-s pulse of 50 mM HCl. Fitting of experimental
data was done with Biacore T200 evaluation software,
version 1.0 using a 1:1 interaction model to determine
apparent binding constants.
Blocking of brain lysate seeding activity
Measuring of RD-CFP/YFP co-aggregation by FRET was
described in detail previously [36, 37]. Briefly, HEK293
cells were plated at 250,000 cells/well in a 12-well plate
and co-transfected with plasmids encoding P301S tau re-
peat domain (RD) containing ΔK280 mutation and fused
to cyan (RD(ΔK280)-CFP) or yellow (RD(ΔK280)-YFP)
fluorescent protein at proportions 1:3 as described earl-
ier. 15 h later, cells were harvested with 0.05% trypsin
for 3 min at 37 °C, and then re-plated in a 96-well plate
in quadruplicate. After 15 h brain lysates of P301S Tg
mice untreated (prepared in 1X TBS with protease,
phosphatase inhibitors) or pre-incubated for 16 h at 4 °C
under constant rotation with Armanezumab (10 μg/ml)
were added. Cells were then cultured for additional 24 h
before FRET analysis by flow cytometry. For determin-
ation of baseline level of RD(ΔK280)-CFP/YFP endogen-
ous aggregation, cells were cultured without addition of
brain lysates or antibody. FRET flow cytometry was per-
formed using MACSQuant VYB (Miltenyi). Integrated
FRET density was calculated as percent of FRET-positive
cells x median fluorescence intensity (MFI).
Brain lysate seeding activity after immunodepletion
Armanezumab and control antibodies (50 μg) were
added to agarose beads with protein A and G, then cova-
lently coupled using Crosslink Immunoprecipitation Kit
(Pierce) according to the provided protocol. Then brain
lysates were immunodepleted four times with column
elution
between
each
immunodepletion.
The
final
immunodepleted lysate was normalized to 0.97 μg/ml
protein (measured by BCA), co-incubated with lipofecta-
mine® reagent and added to HEK293T cell line (kindly
provided by Dr. Diamond) constitutively expressing
P301S tau repeat domain (RD) fused with either cyan
protein (CFP) or yellow protein (YPF). Overall 10.3 μl of
lysate, 1.25 μl of lipofectamine and 13.45 μl of optimem
were used for each well. The incubations of lipofecta-
mine were done according to the recommended proto-
col for DNA transfection. After 24 h incubation cells
were harvested by trypsinization and tested for FRET by
flow cytometry. Integrated FRET density was calculated.
Neurotoxicity assay
Neurotoxicity of oligomeric tau was assessed in SHSY-5Y
cell culture and in primary neurons using MTT (3-[4,5-di-
methylthiazol-2-yl]-2.5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay
performed as described previously [31, 32] in the presence
of tau oligomers plus or minus test antibody (Armanezu-
mab). Incubation time of cells with tau oligomers and tau
oligomers/antibodies was 16 h, and the final concentrations
of protein and antibodies were 0.5 μM and 1 μM,
respectively.
Intracranial injection of antibodies and quantitative
image analysis
Armanezumab and control IgG were delivered to the
hippocampus and cortex using a stereotaxic apparatus.
Briefly, tau/Tg mice were anesthetized with isofluorane,
placed in the stereotaxic frame and injected with Arma-
nezumab (2 μg/μl) into the hippocampus (1 μl/injection)
and into the cortex (1 μl/injection) by a 5 μl Hamilton
microsyringe (30-gauge) at an injection rate of 0.5 μl/
min, using the following coordinates relative to Bregma:
AP: −2.06, ML: ±1.75; DV: −1.95 pocket 1 μl, and −1.00
1 μl. Control IgG was injected into the contralateral
hemisphere using the same technique. The right side of
each brain received Armanezumab while the left side
was injected with the control IgG. Mice were sacrificed
five days after the injection via Nembutal overdose and
transcardially perfused with ice-cold 0.01 M phosphate-
buffered saline (PBS). Brains were rapidly removed and
fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4) for 24 h
at 4 °C and then sunk in 20% sucrose (in PBS). Prior to
sectioning, a notch was made in the bottom left cortex
so that left and right sides could be readily distinguished
after sectioning. Brains were then cut in 40 μm thick
coronal sections on a Microtome slicing system (Leica)
and stored in PBS with 0.05% NaN3 at 4 °C until used.
Sections were mounted on the slides and dried. Slices
were pretreated with sodium citrate buffer, pH 6.0 at
90 °C for 30 min. All sections were hydrogen peroxide
quenched, blocked and incubated with primary antibody
overnight at 4 °C. Total tau was detected with HT7 rec-
ognizing epitopes 159–163, (0.4 μg/ml), phosphorylated
tau was detected with T212 (pT212, 1 μg/ml), S214
(pS214, 0.4 μg/ml), AT100 (pT212/pS214, 0.4 μg/ml),
PHF1 1 μg/ml (pS396/pS404, 2 μg/ml), AT8 (pS202/T205,

 0.4 μg/ml) (all from ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham,
MA except for PHF1 from Peter Davis), and AT180
(pT231, 0.4 μg/ml (Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom).
Anti-human IgG antibody was used to determine the anti-
body diffusion area in the brain parenchyma and anti-
NeuN antibody was used to define the neuron density in
injected sites. Incubations with appropriate biotinylated
secondary antibody and ABC for 1 h were performed
followed by color development using DAB (3,3’-diamino-
benzidine) substrate kit (both from Vector Labs, CA). Im-
ages
were
captured
by
an
Olympus
microscope.
Immunostaining profiles were observed by the means of a
Sony high resolution CCD video camera (XC-77) and
NIH Image version 1.59b5 software. For every animal, the
images of the CA1 areas of three sections per each anti-
body were captured with the 10X objective. For the quanti-
tative analysis, the images were cropped to the size of 1000
× 800 pixels at 600 dpi resolution, imported using ImageJ
software (Scion) and converted to black and white using
automatic binarization script. Thresholds were calculated
for each picture separately using the same algorithm, and
the number of pixels expressing staining density was deter-
mined in CA1 (injection) area for both ipsilateral and
contralateral hemispheres. Density is expressed in the per-
centage units calculated using formula I/(I + C)x100 and
C/(I + C)x100 where I-ipsilateral, C-contralateral. Average
and standard deviation for each hemisphere between all
mice were calculated and compared.
Pharmacokinetic data analysis
C57BL6 and PS19 tau/Tg mice received a single 600 μg/
mouse intravenous (IV) dose of Armanezumab. Blood
samples were collected by retro-orbital bleeding for PK
at the following time points: 1, 4, 7, 11, 14, 18, 21, 28
and 54 days. Three mice per group underwent bleeding
for each time point so that blood was drawn from an
individual mouse only for every fourth time point. Con-
centrations of Armanezumab in the sera were deter-
mined by ELISA as described in [94] except that plates
were coated with 2.5 μM recombinant tau protein and
purified 1C9 mAb and Armanezumab were used for
calibration curve. PK parameters were calculated by
non-compartmental analysis of the mean concentration
values for each mouse using WinNonlin, version 5.2
(Pharsight). The following standard pharmacokinetic
parameters were determined: (i) the maximum concentra-
tion (Cmax); (ii) the time of Cmax occurrence (tmax); (iii)
area under the sera concentration-time curve from time
zero to the time of the last measured serum level (AUC);
(iv) t1/2, calculated by linear regression of the logarithm of
plasma concentration-time curve; (v) elimination constant
kel = 0.693/t1/2; (vi) apparent volume of distribution (Vd)
obtained by calculating Vd = dose/AUC x kel.
Statistical analysis
All statistical parameters [mean, standard deviation
(SD), significant difference, etc.] used in experiments
were calculated using Prism 6 software (GraphPad
Software, Inc.). Statistically significant differences were
examined using unpaired t-test or Ordinary one-way
ANOVA Tukey’s multiple comparisons test (P value
less than 0.05 was considered as statistically different).
