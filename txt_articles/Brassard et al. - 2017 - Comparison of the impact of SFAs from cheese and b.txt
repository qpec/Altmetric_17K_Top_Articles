ABSTRACT
Background: Controversies persist concerning the association be-
tween intake of dietary saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and cardiovas-
cular disease risk.
Objective: We compared the impact of consuming equal amounts
of SFAs from cheese and butter on cardiometabolic risk factors.
Design: In a multicenter, crossover, randomized controlled trial,
92 men and women with abdominal obesity and relatively low
HDL-cholesterol concentrations were assigned to sequences of 5
predetermined isoenergetic diets of 4 wk each separated by 4-wk
washouts: 2 diets rich in SFAs (12.4–12.6% of calories) from either
cheese or butter; a monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA)–rich diet
(SFAs: 5.8%, MUFAs: 19.6%); a polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)–
rich diet (SFAs: 5.8%, PUFAs: 11.5%); and a low-fat, high-carbohydrate
diet (fat: 25%, SFAs: 5.8%).
Results: Serum HDL-cholesterol concentrations were similar after the
cheese and butter diets but were significantly higher than after the
carbohydrate diet (13.8% and 14.7%, respectively; P , 0.05 for
both). LDL-cholesterol concentrations after the cheese diet were lower
than after the butter diet (23.3%, P , 0.05) but were higher than after
the carbohydrate (12.6%), MUFA (15.3%), and PUFA (112.3%)
diets (P , 0.05 for all). LDL-cholesterol concentrations after the
butter diet also increased significantly (from 16.1% to 116.2%,
P , 0.05) compared with the carbohydrate, MUFA, and PUFA diets.
The LDL-cholesterol response to treatment was significantly modified
by baseline values (P-interaction ¼ 0.02), with the increase in LDL
cholesterol being significantly greater with butter than with cheese
only among individuals with high baseline LDL-cholesterol concen-
trations. There was no significant difference between all diets on in-
flammation markers, blood pressure, and insulin-glucose homeostasis.
Conclusions: The results of our study suggest that the consumption of
SFAs from cheese and butter has similar effects on HDL cholesterol but
differentially modifies LDL-cholesterol concentrations compared with the
effects of carbohydrates, MUFAs, and PUFAs, particularly in individuals
with high LDL cholesterol. In contrast, SFAs from either cheese or butter
have no significant effects on several other nonlipid cardiometabolic
risk factors. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as
NCT02106208.

INTRODUCTION
Most dietary guidelines have advocated for a restriction of
dietary SFAs for the optimal management of cardiovascular
health (1, 2). However, the association between SFAs and risk of
cardiovascular disease (CVD)12 remains controversial. On the
one hand, several meta-analyses of observational studies have
shown that self-reported intakes of SFAs were not associated
with increased risk of all-cause mortality, CVD, coronary artery
disease (CAD), or ischemic stroke (3, 4). In contrast, a sys-
tematic review of early randomized controlled trials (RCT) has
shown a small but significant reduction in CVD risk when di-
etary SFAs have been substituted with PUFAs (5).
The controversy surrounding SFAs and CVD risk has been
further fueled by data from studies that have shown that dietary
SFAs may have different associations with CVD risk depending
on the food source of SFA. For example, a 5% increase in energy
from dairy SFAs in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis has
been associated with a 38% lower CVD risk, whereas a 5% in-
crease in energy from meat SFAs was shown to predict a 69%

 higher CVD risk (6). The food matrix may also modify the impact
of SFAs on CVD risk factors. In a meta-analysis of RCTs, de
Goede et al. (7) have shown that, for similar SFA intakes and
ratios of PUFAs to SFAs, the consumption of hard cheese reduced
LDL cholesterol and HDL cholesterol compared with the effect
of butter.
Results from the meta-analysis by de Goede et al. (7) were
limited in scope because they were based on data from only 5
RCTs, each of which had relatively small sample sizes (n = 14–
49). All studies were conducted in Europe (8–11) or in Australia
(12). To our knowledge, no previous study has compared the
effects of SFAs from cheese and butter on cardiometabolic risk
to those of MUFAs or PUFAs in a North American context.
Finally, the majority of the available RCTs have focused on lipid
risk factors. Therefore, there has been limited information re-
garding the impact of SFAs from different sources on nonlipid
cardiometabolic risk factors.
The primary objective of this multicenter, randomized,
crossover, controlled-consumption study was to compare the
impact of SFAs from different dairy food sources, namely cheese
and butter, on plasma lipid concentrations, blood pressure, and
other cardiometabolic risk factors including factors that are re-
lated to glucose-insulin homeostasis and inflammation. As a
secondary objective, we compared the impact of consuming SFAs
from different dairy sources to that of other fat sources, including
MUFAs and PUFAs, on cardiometabolic risk. On the basis of
the available evidence, we hypothesized that the cheese matrix
would attenuate the cardiometabolic effects associated with the
consumption of SFAs.
METHODS
Participants
This study was undertaken as a multicenter RCT that involved
the following 2 Canadian research centers: the Institute of Nu-
trition and Functional Foods (INAF) in Quebec City and the
Richardson Center for Functional Foods and Nutraceuticals
(RCFFN) in Winnipeg. Recruitment took place between May
2014 and May 2015. Advertisements were published in news-
papers, circulated in local hospitals, and displayed on notice
boards at companies near the university campuses. Invitations
were also sent via mailing lists that were available in both
centers. To be eligible, participants had to be 18–65 y old, have a
waist circumference $94 and $80 cm for men and women,
respectively, and have HDL-cholesterol concentrations below
the
age-
and
sex-specific
75th
percentiles
(#1.34
and
#1.53 mmol/L for men and women, respectively) to exclude
individuals with high HDL-cholesterol concentrations, which
was the primary study outcome. The study originally set out to
recruit individuals on the basis of a high waist circumference
and serum triglyceride concentration .1.7 mmol/L. However,
this combination of inclusion criteria yielded an extremely low
recruitment rate. The triglyceride criterion was modified to the
aforementioned HDL-cholesterol criterion 3 mo into the study to
facilitate recruitment. Participants had to have stable body
weight (62.5 kg) $6 mo before their inclusion in the trial.
Menopausal status was defined as being without regular menses
$1 y. Exclusion criteria were as follows: a history of CVD, type
2 diabetes, or monogenic dyslipidemia; the use of medications
for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, or glycemic control; un-
controlled endocrine disorder such as hypothyroidism or hy-
perthyroidism; smoking; a Framingham-calculated CAD risk
score .20%; any food allergies or aversion to foods that were
included in the menu; particular nutritional habits such as veg-
etarianism; and women with menstrual irregularities including
those who were experiencing perimenopause. The use of an anti-
inflammatory drug was prohibited during the entire study period
including the 4-wk preintervention period and washout periods.
Other medications were allowed as long as the use and dosage
had been stable over the 1 y that preceded the recruitment of the
participants. The study protocol was thoroughly explained dur-
ing the screening process, and written consent was obtained
from all participants before undertaking the dietary phases. The
study protocol was approved by local ethical boards and was
registered on 4 April 2014 at clinicaltrials.gov at NCT02106208.
Experimental diet composition and study design
We used a single-blind crossover study design in which
participants were randomly assigned to 8 predetermined se-
quences of the following 5 treatments: 1) a diet that was rich in
SFAs from cheese, 2) a diet that was rich in SFAs from butter,
3) a diet that was rich in MUFAs, 4) a diet that was rich in
PUFAs, and 5) a high-carbohydrate, low-fat diet. The SFA
content was matched in the cheese and butter diets. In the other
diets, MUFAs, PUFAs, and carbohydrates replaced SFAs from
the cheese and butter diets through dietary manipulations.
Specifically, proteins from cheese in the cheese diet were re-
placed by increasing the serving sizes of meat and eggs in the
other 4 diets. The grams of fat from cheese in the cheese diet
were replaced by corresponding amounts of butter fat, refined
olive oil, and corn oil in the butter, MUFA, and PUFA diets
respectively. Carbohydrates from foods (vegetables, fruit, and
grains) as well from added sugars (honey, sugar and brown
sugar, jam, maple syrup, and 100% fruit juice) were substituted
for fats in the 4 high-fat diets (cheese, butter, MUFA, and PUFA
diets). Vegetables, fruit, and grain products with low-fiber con-
tents were chosen in the carbohydrate diet to balance fiber intake
across all diets. The identified foods and added sugars repre-
sented, on average, 77% and 23% of added carbohydrates,
respectively, in the carbohydrate diet. More specifically, the
carbohydrate diet provided a mean of 10.0 g added sugars
(per 2500 kcal/d) compared with the amount in the cheese diet,
whereas the remaining extra carbohydrates came from foods.
Diets were identical in terms of energy, protein, cholesterol,
sodium, and fiber contents. Calcium and potassium contents were
higher in the cheese diet than in the other 4 experimental diets
(Table 1). Each of the 5 treatment phases had a 4-wk duration
and was followed by a washout period $24 d. Three meals and 1
snack were provided each day to participants on the basis of a
7-d rotating menu, which was reproducible for the 5 diets and
similar across the 2 participating research centers. The experi-
mental diets were developed with the use of the Nutritional
Database System for Research (2011; Nutrition Coordinating
Center). Dietetic technicians prepared all recipes and meals in
the metabolic kitchen of participating centers. Diets were pro-
vided under isoenergetic conditions to maintain a constant body
weight. Energy needs for each participant were estimated with
the use of validated equations (13) as well as from values that

 were estimated with the use of a validated, quantitative, web-
based food-frequency questionnaire that was completed before
the beginning of the trial (14). During each dietary phase, par-
ticipants were asked to come to the INAF or RCFFN $3 times/wk
to pick up the meals and snacks. Subjects were also encouraged,
whenever possible, to consume either breakfast or lunch on site
every weekday under staff supervision. Subjects were instructed to
consume all of the food provided, and only that food, while limiting
the consumption of caffeinated beverages and sugar-free beverages
to 2 beverages/d. A discretionary amount of 0% fat fluid milk
(105 g) was provided to subjects weekly if requested. Alcohol in-
take was not allowed 2 d before the beginning of the study and
during each dietary phase. Body weight was monitored continu-
ously throughout each dietary phase, and food provision was ad-
justed when subjects body weight fluctuated .2 kg over 1 wk.
Subjects were instructed to maintain their usual physical activities
except for the 4 d that preceded blood sampling at the various
stages of the study, during which subjects were asked not to engage
in any form of vigorous physical activity. Subjects could not be
blinded to the cheese diet but were blinded to the other 4 diets.
Compliance
Compliance to treatments was assessed via checklists that were
filled out by participants on a weekly basis, which allowed for the
identification of foods that were consumed and foods that were not
consumed. Checklists provided information on beverage intake as
well as on current medication use. Participants were asked to notify
the coordinator who was in charge of the project from both centers
before starting any new medication. Compliancewas assessed during
each dietary phase. Thus, a subject may have been compliant in some
phases but not in others. It was decided a priori that we would
exclude from the analyses all data points that were collected during a
treatment phase for which the self-reported compliance was ,80%.
Risk-factor assessment
Body weight, together with waist and hip circumferences,
were measured according to standardized procedures throughout
the study (15). The mean of the 2 postdiet values was used for the
calculation of postdiet BMI. Body fat and composition were assessed
with the use of dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (GE Healthcare) at
the end of each dietary phase. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures
were determined at screening, beginning, and the end of each dietary
phase from the mean of 3 consecutive measurements that were
taken 10 min apart in the sitting position with the use of an automated
blood pressure monitor (Digital BPM HEM-907XL model; Omron).
Analyses of cardiometabolic risk factors were performed on 12-h
fasting blood samples that were collected from the antecubital vein.
All cardiometabolic risk factors were measured twice on consec-
utive days at the end of each dietary phase, and the mean of the 2
measurements was used in all analyses. Treatment-specific baseline
values were measured once. Laboratory analyses were carried out
with staff blinded to study treatments.
Serum total cholesterol, triglyceride, and HDL-cholesterol
concentrations were assessed with the use of a Roche/Hitachi
Modular system (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manu-
facturer’s specifications and with the use of proprietary reagents.
Serum LDL-cholesterol concentrations were calculated with the
use of the Friedewald equation except in 2 subjects who had
serum triglyceride concentrations .4.5 mmol/L on 4 occasions,
in which cases, LDL cholesterol was considered to be missing.
Plasma total apolipoprotein B (apo B) concentrations were
measured with the use of the a commercial ELISA kit (A70102;
Alerchek). Serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein concen-
trations were determined with the use of the Behring Latex-
Enhanced highly sensitive assay on a Behring Nephelometer
BN-100 (Behring Diagnostic) and the calibrators (N Rheuma-
tology Standard SL) that were provided by the manufacturer as
described previously (16). High-sensitivity C-reactive protein
concentrations were considered to be missing when the mean of
the 2 consecutive postdiet values was .10 mg/L. Adiponectin
was measured with the use of a commercial ELISA kit for the
human form (K1001-1; B-Bridge International). Fasting blood
glucose concentrations were examined with the use of color-
imetry, whereas insulin concentrations were tested with the use
of electrochemiluminescence (Roche Diagnostics). Finally, the
HOMA-IR was calculated with the use of the formula that was
developed by Matthews et al. (17).

 Sample-size calculations
The change in HDL cholesterol after cheese compared with
after butter was considered as the primary analysis for a priori
sample-size calculations. Accordingly, it was determined that a
sample size of n = 70 would allow for the detection of a 6.3%
between-diet difference in plasma HDL-cholesterol concentra-
tions with a power of 90% (P = 0.05). A dropout rate of 20%
was projected on the basis of our recent experience in a similarly
FIGURE 1
Flowchart diagram. Of 135 eligible subjects, 103 individuals were randomly assigned. The dropout rate was 37.9% (39 of 103 subjects who were
randomly assigned). Reasons for dropping out were as follows: job, study, family, or travel constraints (n = 12); lost to follow-up (n = 6); loss of interest (n = 5); the
protocol was too demanding (n = 5); diet issues (did not like the food; n = 5); health problems that were unrelated to the study protocol (n = 3); pregnancies (n = 2);
and medical constraint (n = 1). A total of 92 subjects completed $1 phase, whereas 64 subjects completed all 5 phases. HDL-C, HDL cholesterol.

 designed, multicenter, crossover consumption study that com-
prised 5 diets, each of which were separated by a 4-wk washout
(18). The required sample size of n = 90 was slightly exceeded
during recruitment.
Statistical analyses
Differences in study outcomes in treatments (postdiet values)
were assessed with the use of mixed models for repeated mea-
sures in SAS software (v9.4; SAS Institute Inc.) with the
treatment, sex, center, and sequence of treatments as fixed effects
and subjects as a random effect. A pairwise comparison of
treatments was examined only when the overall P value for the
main treatment effect in the mixed models was ,0.05. The
Holm-Bonferroni procedure was used to adjust for multiple
comparisons of the various treatments (19). This sequential step-
down approach is considered one of the best-known techniques
to control for a family-wise error rate. The method is similar to
the classical Bonferroni correction. Specifically, the method
ensures that the probability of $1 false discovery under the null
hypothesis is fixed at the specified a level. However, the Holm-
Bonferroni correction offers more statistical power without re-
quiring any further assumption. Briefly, P values of the tests under
consideration are rank ordered so that P1 # P2 # . # Pk, where
k is the number of tests. Original P values are sequentially
adjusted; e.g., the adjusted value of P1 is equal to k times the
original value of P1, and the adjusted value of P2 is the
maximum between the adjusted value of P1 and (k 2 1) times
the original value of P2. Adjusted P values are evaluated
against the criterion of a = 0.05. The multiple comparisons
under consideration were set a priori as follows: cheese
compared with butter; cheese compared with carbohydrates,
MUFAs, and PUFAs; and butter compared with carbohy-
drates, MUFAs, and PUFAs. MUFA, PUFA, and carbohydrate
comparisons were not considered because they were not part
of the primary aim of the study. With the use of a most
parsimonious modeling approach, potential confounders of
the changes in cardiometabolic risk factors with treatment,
including baseline values of the selected outcome, center,
sequence of treatments, sex, age, BMI, waist:hip ratio, and
ethnicity and their interaction with treatment, were included
in the final mixed models only when they were shown to be
significant at P , 0.05. The normality in the distribution of all
study outcomes was considered, and data were log trans-
formed when required. In the primary analyses, multiple
imputations of missing data were not used because mixed
models have been shown to be robust even when a significant
proportion of data are missing at random (20). However, data
were also analyzed with the use of an intent-to-treat (ITT) ap-
proach with multiple imputation of missing data. More detailed
information on how this analysis was conducted and the results
are presented in Supplemental Table 1.
RESULTS
Figure 1 presents the study flowchart. Consumption by par-
ticipants was initiated on 9 July 2014, and all participants
completed the intervention on 18 February 2016. Of 135 eligible
men and women, a total of 103 individuals were randomly as-
signed to the treatment sequences, 92 subjects completed $1
treatment phase, and 64 subjects completed all 5 treatments. Of
39 participants who dropped out, 20 individuals were from the
INAF, and 19 individuals were from the RCFFN. The main
reasons for dropping out were as follows: job, study, family,
or travel constraints (n = 12); lost to follow-up or a loss of
interest (n = 11); the dietary protocol was too demanding or
because of diet issues (n = 10); and medical constraints,
pregnancies, or other health problems (n = 6). A total of 14
treatment-specific data from 8 participants at the RCFFN with
compliance ,80% were excluded as per the eligibility criteria
for analyses. The self-reported compliance of all participants
at the INAF was .80% for all dietary phases. Characteristics
at the screening of the 92 subjects who were included in the
analyses are shown in Table 2. Participants from the INAF
and RCFFN had a similarly low 10-y CVD Framingham risk
score at baseline.
The mean 6 SD self-reported compliance to diets during
each treatment phase on the basis of food-consumption
checklists was high (98.7% 6 2.4%) and was similar be-
tween treatments (P = 0.83; Kruskal-Wallis test; data not
shown) after the exclusion of data from noncompliant sub-
jects. Self-reported compliance was significantly different be-
tween centers, although the difference was marginal [INAF:
99.4% 6 1.2%; RCFFN: 97.5% 6 3.4% (P , 0.0001; Kruskal-
Wallis test)]. The mean duration of each dietary phase was
27.9 6 0.9 d and was similar in treatments (P = 0.60; Kruskal-
Wallis test). The median washout time between consecutive
treatments was 33 d. No difference was observed between diets in
terms of the frequency of self-reported, nonserious adverse events
(Supplemental Table 2).
Table 3 presents the anthropometric and cardiometabolic risk
profiles of participants after each diet. Waist circumference,
BMI, and body fat were stable throughout the experiment, which
reflected the isoenergetic nature of the trial. Serum HDL-
cholesterol concentrations were similar after the cheese and
butter diets but were significantly higher (+3.8% and +4.7%,
respectively; P , 0.05 for both) than after the carbohydrate diet.
After the cheese diet, LDL-cholesterol concentrations were
significantly lower (23.3%; P , 0.05) than after the butter diet
but were higher (+2.6%, +5.3%, and +12.3%; P , 0.05 for all)
than after carbohydrate, MUFA, and PUFA diets, respectively.
LDL-cholesterol concentrations after the butter diet were sig-
nificantly higher (+6.1%, +8.9%, and +16.2%; P , 0.05 for all)
than after the carbohydrate, MUFA, and PUFA diets, re-
spectively. The baseline LDL-cholesterol concentration signifi-
cantly modified the LDL-cholesterol response to treatment
(P-interaction = 0.02). As shown in Figure 2, the difference in
LDL cholesterol between cheese and butter diets was significant
in subjects with high baseline LDL cholesterol but not in those
with lower baseline LDL cholesterol irrespective of the comparator
nutrient. No such interaction was observed for other car-
diometabolic risk factors.
Cheese led to higher serum triglyceride concentrations (+5.1%
and +10.0%; P , 0.05 for both) compared with the effects of
butter and PUFAs, respectively, but not compared with the ef-
fects of MUFAs or carbohydrates. Butter was associated with re-
duced serum triglycerides (26.8%; P , 0.05) compared with the
effect of carbohydrates but not compared with the effects of MUFAs
and PUFAs. There was no difference between cheese and butter in
terms of apo B concentrations and the cholesterol:HDL-cholesterol
804

 ratio. However, both diets significantly increased apo B and the
cholesterol:HDL-cholesterol ratio compared with the effects of
the MUFA and PUFA diets. Finally, there was no significant
difference in blood pressure, inflammation markers, and in-
dexes of glucose-insulin homeostasis across the experimental
diets. There was also no significant interaction between treat-
ment and sex or adiposity in the prediction of the response to
diets for any cardiometabolic risk factors. As shown in Sup-
plemental Table 1, results from the ITT and multiple imputa-
tion analysis and those from the per protocol analysis were
similar with a few minor exceptions. Specifically, the ITT
analysis revealed no significant treatment effect on postintervention
HDL cholesterol, and there was no significant difference in
postintervention LDL-cholesterol concentrations between
cheese and carbohydrate diets.
Figure 3 shows differences in observed values compared with
values that were predicted on the basis of accepted equations
(21) for changes in blood lipids and apo B when carbohydrates
were replaced isoenergetically by SFAs from either cheese or
butter. In the absence of a food-matrix effect, differences be-
tween observed and predicted changes should have been equal
to zero. Observed LDL-cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol con-
centrations were significantly lower than predicted values when
carbohydrates (6.8% of energy) were replaced by SFAs from
cheese. This was not the case for butter. The replacement of
carbohydrates by SFAs from cheese led to higher serum tri-
glyceride concentrations than were predicted, whereas the
replacement of carbohydrates by SFAs from butter led to higher-
than-predicted apo B concentrations.
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this large, randomized, and carefully
controlled consumption study provides new perspectives relative
to the effects of dietary SFAs on cardiometabolic risk. One unique
methodologic aspect of this investigation was that SFAs from
cheese and butter were compared with carbohydrates but also
with other control nutrients (i.e., MUFAs and PUFAs). First, the
isocaloric replacement of carbohydrates by SFAs from both cheese
and butter increased serum HDL-cholesterol concentrations.
Although the changes in HDL cholesterol with cheese and butter
were similar in magnitude, values that were recorded after the
cheese diet were significantly lower than those that were pre-
dicted with the use of established equations (21). The different
effects of SFAs from cheese and butter on LDL cholesterol were
amplified in men and women with high baseline LDL-cholesterol
concentrations irrespective of the comparator nutrient. Finally,
SFAs from cheese and butter had no effect on several nonlipid
cardiometabolic risk factors compared with the effects of car-
bohydrates, MUFAs, and PUFAs.
Only a few RCTs have compared the effects of SFAs from
cheese and butter on LDL-cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol
concentrations (8–12). All of the studies have used a crossover
design with sample sizes that ranged from n = 14 to n = 49, and

 3 of the 5 studies provided all foods to the participants (9–11).
Results, which were very consistent between studies, have been
summarized in a recent meta-analysis (7). For a similar ratio of
PUFAs to SFAs, the consumption of cheese compared with that
of butter significantly reduced HDL cholesterol by 0.05 mmol/L
(95% CI: 0.02, 0.09 mmol/L) and LDL-cholesterol concentra-
tions by 0.22 mmol/L (95% CI: 0.14, 0.29 mmol/L) (7). In our
study, the consumption of SFAs from cheese and butter led to
similar HDL-cholesterol concentrations, which were higher than
those after consumption of the low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet,
but were similar to the values after consumption of the MUFA
and PUFA diets. In contrast, after consumption of the cheese
diet, serum HDL-cholesterol concentrations were lower than
those that were predicted on the basis of established predictive
equations (21), which was a result that was consistent with a
small food-matrix effect that modulated the impact of SFAs on

 HDL cholesterol. In previous RCTs, Tholstrup et al. (8) reported
the smallest difference in HDL cholesterol between butter and
cheese (mean difference: 0.03 mmol/L; NS), and the study
participants had the lowest baseline HDL-cholesterol concen-
trations (mean: 1.23 mmol/L). In our study, participants also had
relatively low HDL cholesterol as per our recruitment criteria
(HDL cholesterol below age- and sex-specific 75th percentiles),
which suggested that the food-matrix effects that mediate the
impact of SFAs on HDL cholesterol may be attenuated when
baseline HDL cholesterol is lower. It has become clear that
HDL-cholesterol concentrations may poorly reflect the anti-
atherogenic properties of HDL particles (22). More studies are
needed to investigate whether SFAs from different sources have
an effect on the cholesterol efflux capacity as well as on HDL
anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.
In our study, the mean reduction in LDL cholesterol after
consumption of the cheese diet compared with after consumption
of the butter diet was 0.11 mmol/L (P , 0.05), which was one-
half of what was observed (20.22 mmol/L; 95% CI: 20.29,
20.14 mmol/L) in the meta-analysis by de Goede et al. (7). The
food-matrix effect in our study was further evidenced by the fact
that the substitution of SFAs from cheese by carbohydrates led
to lower LDL cholesterol than was predicted on the basis of the
established predictive equations (21). This outcome was not the
case for SFAs from butter. Our data also suggest that the LDL-
cholesterol–raising effect of SFAs from butter compared with
that of SFAs from cheese is amplified in individuals with higher
LDL-cholesterol concentrations. The extent to which baseline
LDL cholesterol modifies the response to dietary changes has
been documented in the past, and our results further support this
notion (23). Some of the variability in the LDL-cholesterol re-
sponse to dietary SFAs has been attributed to interindividual
differences in the rate of catabolism of LDL particles. Indi-
viduals in whom LDL-cholesterol concentrations are high be-
cause of a reduced fractional catabolic rate of LDL particles
may be particularly sensitive to changes in dietary SFAs, which
are known to downregulate the LDL-receptor activity (24).
Single nucleotide polymorphisms in the apolipoprotein E gene
and other genes that are involved in cholesterol metabolism may
also influence the LDL-cholesterol response to changes in dairy
SFAs (25), but it is unclear how different sources of SFAs may
modify these effects. Finally, it has been suggested that the ef-
fects of dietary SFAs and cholesterol on the lipid profile may be
attenuated in obese and insulin-resistant individuals and those
with metabolic syndrome (26, 27). In our study, interindividual
variations in body weight, waist circumference, or the HOMA
index did not modify the impact of SFAs (irrespective of source)
on LDL cholesterol compared with that of the substitute nutrients.
Very few studies have compared the impact of cheese and butter
on nonlipid risk factors. The current study revealed no differences
in nonlipid cardiometabolic risk factors between the cheese and
butter diets. Thus, the food-matrix effects appeared to be very
specific to cholesterol metabolism. It has been shown that the
calcium content in cheese may alter the whole-body cholesterol
pool by reducing lipid absorption in the intestine, thereby en-
hancing the excretion of SFAs and cholesterol through feces and by
suppressing endogenous cholesterol synthesis in the liver (28–30).
The difference in calcium intake between butter and cheese diets
(w400 mg/2500 kcal) was less than one-half that in previous
RCTs (8–12), but this reduction may have been enough to induce
different LDL cholesterol responses to the cheese and butter. The
phospholipids that are present in milk-fat globule membranes of
all dairies except butter as well as the bacterial content of cheese
have also been evoked as potential mechanisms that may underlie
the differential effects of SFAs from cheese and butter on LDL-
cholesterol concentrations (31–33). Finally, the extent to which
differences in the relative contents of specific SFAs in cheese and
butter are responsible for the food-matrix effect is unclear (7).
As expected, the replacement of SFAs from either cheese or
butter by MUFAs and PUFAs reduced serum LDL-cholesterol
and apo B concentrations (21, 34). In contrast, SFAs, irre-
spective of the dietary source, had no effects on HDL cholesterol,

in blood lipids when SFAs from cheese (6.8% of energy) or from butter (6.6% of energy) replaced CHO. *,**For the difference between observed and

SFAS, DAIRY, AND CARDIOMETABOLIC RISK FACTORS

 inflammation markers, indexes of insulin-glucose homeostasis, or
blood pressure compared with the effect of MUFAs and PUFAs.
In general, cheese consumption has shown no association with
risk of CAD or hypertension and may even be associated with
reduced risks of stroke and type 2 diabetes (35). Recent data
from a systematic review and meta-analysis also suggested that
butter shows relatively small or neutral overall associations with
mortality, CVD, and diabetes (36). The reconciliation of data from
RCTs and observational studies is challenging. Further studies are
needed to explore how the neutral effects of SFAs from cheese and
butter on several cardiometabolic risk factors, compared with the
effects of MUFAs and PUFAs, possibly abrogate their LDL-
cholesterol raising effects on CAD-related outcomes.
This study has several strengths. First, to our knowledge, it is
the largest trial thus far to have compared SFAs from butter and
cheese. The large sample size combined with the controlled-
consumption conditions and crossover nature of the study pro-
vided statistical power to detect very small effects in treatments. To
our knowledge, this is the first study to compare effects of SFAs
from both cheese and butter with those of carbohydrate-, MUFA-,
and PUFA-rich diets, simultaneously. Weaknesses include a
limited capacity to assess true compliance, which was based on
self-reporting. The high dropout rate is also a limitation, although
it was not entirely unexpected considering the duration and the
commitment that were needed to complete the protocol. However,
mixed models are robust when data are missing at random, which
was very probable in this study. Sensitivity analyses with the use of
data from the center with the lowest dropout rate yielded similar
results (data not shown). Further ITT analyses also supported the
notion that there is a food-matrix effect that modulates the impact
of SFAs on LDL-cholesterol concentrations as well as no effect of
SFAs, irrespective of the food source, on nonlipid cardiometabolic
risk factors (Supplemental Table 1).
In conclusion, data from this large, carefully controlled RCT
suggest that there is a significant food-matrix effect that mod-
ulates the impact of SFAs on blood lipids. This food-matrix effect
on LDL cholesterol may be exacerbated in individuals with high
baseline LDL cholesterol and appears to be independent of
whether SFAs from both cheese and butter are substituted for
carbohydrates, MUFAs, or PUFAs. These findings reinforce the
importance to consider whole foods and food sources as opposed
to single nutrients when assessing the impact of diet on health.
Finally, data indicate that SFAs from cheese have no significant
effect on several nonlipid cardiometabolic risk factors, which
may partly explain why cheese intake has not been associated
with increased risk of CAD in observational studies (35).
