Abstract
Breast density is associated with reduced imaging resolution in the detection of breast can-
cer. A biochemical approach that is not affected by density would provide an important tool
to healthcare professionals who are managing women with dense breasts and suspicious
imaging findings. Videssa® Breast is a combinatorial proteomic biomarker assay (CPBA),
comprised of Serum Protein Biomarkers (SPB) and Tumor Associated Autoantibodies
(TAAb) integrated with patient-specific clinical data to produce a diagnostic score that reli-
ably detects breast cancer (BC) as an adjunctive tool to imaging. The performance of
Videssa® Breast was evaluated in the dense (a and b) and non-dense (c and d) groups in a
population of n = 545 women under age 50. The sensitivity and specificity in the dense
breast group were calculated to be 88.9% and 81.2%, respectively, and 92.3% and 86.6%,
respectively, for the non-dense group. No significant differences were observed in the sensi-
tivity (p = 1.0) or specificity (p = 0.18) between these groups. The NPV was 99.3% and
99.1% in non-dense and dense groups, respectively. Unlike imaging, Videssa® Breast does
not appear to be impacted by breast density; it can effectively detect breast cancer in
women with dense and non-dense breasts alike. Thus, Videssa® Breast provides a powerful
tool for healthcare providers when women with dense breasts present with challenging
imaging findings. In addition, Videssa® Breast provides assurance to women with dense
breasts that they do not have breast cancer, reducing further anxiety in this higher risk
patient population.
Background
Imaging is currently the gold standard for breast cancer detection. When imaging results are
questionable (scored as Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) 3 or 4), NCCN
Guidelines recommend that BI-RADS 3 are followed with re-imaging at 6 months, while BI-R-
ADS 4 are recommended for biopsy [1]. Confounding factors such as breast density may limit
the effectiveness of imaging [2–4]. Breast density is a radiologic phenomenon that is not
discernable by palpation; it is a radiologist’s assessment. Imaging rays permeate dense breast

 tissue in a more opaque manner, thereby reducing image resolution [5]. Density is subdivided
into four categories: (a) almost entirely fatty (10% of women); (b) scattered areas of fibrogland-
ular density (40%); (c) heterogenously dense (40%); and (d) extremely dense (10%). African
American women tend to have higher breast density than women of European descent [6].
Women with very dense breasts are at a four- to five-fold increased risk of developing breast
cancer compared to women with low breast density [2,7,8]. In addition, women with
extremely dense breasts are 10 times more likely to have an abnormality missed on mammo-
gram [1].
Thirty-two U.S. states have laws mandating that women be notified of the implications of
breast density to encourage discussions between patients and health-care providers regarding
the need for supplemental screening [9–11]. Of the 32 states currently mandating notifications,
21 mention the association with increased cancer risk and 17 mention supplemental screening,
of which only four mention specific screening modalities. This lack of consistency leads to
confusion for healthcare providers in the management of women with dense breasts and their
follow-up. In addition, the notification of increased breast cancer risk can increase anxiety in
women with a dense breast assessment.
Recently, a study evaluated the differential screening performance of digital mammography
combined with tomosynthesis compared to digital mammography alone as a function of breast
density [12]. When tomosynthesis was combined with digital mammography for screening,
the cancer detection rate increased (by ~20%) and recall rates decreased (by ~13%) for women
with dense and non-dense breasts. These improvements were most pronounced in women
with heterogeneously dense breasts but were not significant for women with extremely dense
breasts. Therefore, imaging limitations persist in the dense breast patient population despite
advancements made by tomosynthesis. A separate study evaluated the inter-observer precision
of scoring breast density in a group of ten mammography technologists and seven radiologists
[13]. This study identified that mammography technologists over-grade breast density, which
can result in redundant ultrasound studies, unnecessary breast biopsies, increased costs, and
patient anxiety. A biochemical approach that is independent of breast architecture and density
would provide an important tool to healthcare professionals who are managing women with
dense breasts.
Recently, clinical performance data was published on Videssa1 Breast, a CPBA comprised
of SPB and TAAb integrated with clinical characteristic data to produce one diagnostic score
that reliably detects breast cancer [14]. Certain blood-based biomarkers are associated with
higher mammographic density [15]; it is unknown whether the biomarkers included in
Videssa1 Breast might be impacted as well. The objective of this study was to evaluate the per-
formance of Videssa1 Breast in women with dense and non-dense breasts and determine
whether this test could provide an additional tool to healthcare providers managing women
who present with dense breasts and challenging imaging findings.
Methods
Study design and participants
Provista-001 (Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT01839045) and Provista-002 (Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT
02078570), which were sponsored by Provista Diagnostics, enrolled women categorized as
either BI-RADS 3 or 4 at the time of enrollment. All imaging modalities such as mammogra-
phy, 3D tomography, ultrasound and MRI were permitted in the trial for the assessment of
BI-RADS 3 or 4. Participants were enrolled at 13 clinical sites across the US, and the study was
IRB-approved at all of these sites (S1 Table). All participants provided written informed con-
sent. Participants who were not diagnosed with BC were followed for six or twelve months for

 clinical outcomes, which included additional imaging or pathology results. Samples were collected
between 04/2013–06/2014 for Provista-001 and between 04/2014–02/2015 for Provista-002.
Breast density status was retrospectively collected for all participants according to the
American College of Radiology reporting system [16]:
1. The breasts are almost entirely fatty
2. There are scattered areas of fibroglandular density
3. The breasts are heterogeneously dense, which may obscure small masses
4. The breasts are extremely dense, which lowers the sensitivity of mammography
In this study, “dense” breasts were defined as being assigned Category c or d and “non-
dense” breasts as Category a or b.
Measurement of SPB and TAAb in serum
Serum was tested for SPB and TAAb as previously described [14]. Briefly, SPB plates were pur-
chased from Meso Scale Discovery (MSD; Rockville, MD) and processed as per manufacturer
instructions. Recombinant TAAb proteins were purchased from Origene (Rockville, MD) and
Abnova (Walnut, CA) and coated on standard-bind MSD 384-well plates. Samples were ana-
lyzed for the relative presence or absence of TAAb by indirect ELISA. All plates were read
using a Meso Sector S600 plate reader and Discovery Workbench 4.0 software.
Videssa® Breast assessment
Serum was tested with Videssa1 Breast as previously described [14]. Briefly, SPB and TAAb
data are combined with patient age into a logistic regression algorithm, the final output being
a high protein signature (HPS) or low protein signature (LPS). The protein signature outcome
corresponds to the likelihood of BC at the time of sample collection. BC samples scored as
HPS were categorized as true positive (TP) and BC samples scored as LPS were categorized as
false negative (FN). Benign samples scored as HPS were categorized as false positive (FP) and
benign samples scored as LPS were categorized as true negative (TN).
Statistical analyses
Clinical performance metrics were calculated using the following:
Sensitivity = (True Positives) � (True Positives + False Negatives)
Specificity = (True Negatives) � (True Negatives + False Positives)
PPV = (True Positives) � (True Positives + False Positives)
NPV = (True Negatives) � (True Negatives + False Negatives)
All analyses were conducted using SAS (version 9.3; SAS, Cary, NC) and the 95% confi-
dence intervals were calculated using VassarStats, which utilizes the efficient-score method
(corrected for continuity) [17,18].
Results
Study population
An overview of the Provista-001 and Provista-002 clinical trials is provided in Fig 1. In Pro-
vista-001, there were 339 eligible participants tested with Videssa1 Breast. Of these, 313

 participants were diagnosed with a benign breast condition (includes participants diagnosed
by biopsy and participants not diagnosed with BC during the follow-up period). Twenty-six
participants were diagnosed as having breast cancer (includes invasive and DCIS). In Provista-
002, a total of 206 participants were tested with Videssa1 Breast. Of these, 200 participants
were diagnosed with a benign breast condition and six participants were diagnosed as having
breast cancer. Participant characteristics are provided in Table 1.
In the complete Provista-001 and Provista-002 retrospective set scored with Videssa1
Breast, there were 284 women with dense breasts and 170 women with non-dense breasts as
defined by American College of Radiology [19].
Evaluation of individual Videssa® Breast biomarkers in women with
dense and non-dense breasts
The individual biomarkers included in Videssa1 Breast were evaluated in the dense and non-
dense groups to determine whether there were any individual biomarkers that were differen-
tially expressed between these groups. These data are summarized in Table 2. A total of four
biomarkers demonstrated statistically significant (p < 0.05) differences in expression (IL-6,
IL-8, ErbB2, and HGF). Videssa1 Breast biomarker data are combined in an algorithm along
clinical patient information, thus these differences do not necessarily suggest a bias in
Videssa1 Breast performance in terms of breast density.
Evaluation of Videssa® Breast in women with dense and non-dense
breasts
To understand the performance of Videssa1 Breast in women with dense breasts, the clinical
sensitivity, specificity, NPV and PPV were evaluated in the dense and non-dense groups from

 in participants with non-dense breasts and dense breasts. The NPV in both groups exceeded
99%; PPV was slightly higher (though not statistically significant) in the non-dense group
(36.4% and 24.2% for non-dense and dense breasts, respectively).
Discussion
Dense breast tissue has been shown to significantly impact the ability of imaging modalities to
detect breast cancer lesions, resulting in increased false-negatives and false-positives [2,20].
Often, clinically, dense breast tissue results in additional imaging above and beyond standard
mammography [12]. Furthermore, confusion is likely when women are informed of a dense
breast assessment but are not provided with clinical direction. Women who are informed that
they have dense breast tissue may believe this to be a clinically significant finding, akin to a
benign condition. Recent advances in imaging have attempted to improve imaging in dense
breast patients with limited success [12]. A protein-based diagnostic assay that is unaffected by
density would be a powerful non-invasive tool to compliment current imaging technologies.
While individual protein biomarker expression levels have been shown to be altered by
breast density, it was unclear whether a biomarker panel composed of many individual bio-
markers would be affected. An interesting observation from this study is the lack of statistical
difference in dense verses non-dense for TAAb, but not SPB. While some SPB did show statis-
tically significant differences, Videssa1 Breast demonstrated high sensitivity in women with
non-dense and dense breasts (92.3% and 88.9%, respectively). This test also exhibited high
specificity in both groups, 86.6% and 81.2%, respectively. There were no significant differences
observed in the sensitivity or specificity of the Videssa1 Breast between patients with non-
dense and dense breasts. NPV exceeded 99% in both groups, but this figure may be skewed
due to low disease prevalence. Prior test probability was 8% for non-dense and 6% for dense
breast subjects (Table 3), based on BC prevalence in the study population. Posterior probability
for a negative (LPS) test outcome was 1% for both groups, meaning a negative test will almost
always correspond to the subject being free of breast cancer. Therefore, unlike imaging,
Videssa1 Breast is not impacted by breast density; it can reliably detect breast cancer in
women under age 50 with dense and non-dense breasts. While additional studies are needed
to determine validity in other age/clinical groups, these results strongly argue for the use of an
anatomical assessment (imaging) in conjunction with an assay (biologic/protein measure-
ment), such as Videssa1 Breast, in women with dense breasts.
The population studied were all subjects with either benign, DCIS, or cancerous findings. A
large number of benign subjects (221/513, or 43%) did not undergo biopsy, therefore clinical
sensitivity and specificity may have been slightly underestimated. Breast cancer prevalence is
generally low in women under age 50 (5.9% in this study), thus an enriched population (BI-R-
ADS 3 and 4) was necessary. Because Videssa1 Breast is indicated only for BI-RADS 3 or 4,
this study was also a robust test of assay performance in the intended use population. Because
of Videssa1 Breast’s high negative predictive value, there is likely value in ruling out cancer in
women with dense breasts, who may experience higher recall rates. The incorporation of
Videssa1 Breast into the clinical decision-making process has the potential to decrease medi-
cal costs associated with additional imaging and biopsy while simultaneously calming the anxi-
ety that women with dense breasts may experience with imaging alone.
Conclusions
This study demonstrates that Videssa1 Breast performance is comparable in women with
dense and non-dense breasts. Videssa1 Breast demonstrates high sensitivity and specificity in
detecting breast cancer, irrespective of density status. Thus, Videssa1 Breast provides an

 additional tool for health-care providers when women with dense breasts present with chal-
lenging imaging findings. In addition, a negative Videssa1 Breast test provides assurance to
women with dense breasts that they likely do not have breast cancer, thereby reducing anxiety
in this higher risk patient population.
