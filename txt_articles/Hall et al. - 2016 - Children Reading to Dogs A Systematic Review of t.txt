Abstract
Background
Despite growing interest in the value of human-animal interactions (HAI) to human mental
and physical health the quality of the evidence on which postulated benefits from animals to
human psychological health are based is often unclear. To date there exist no systematic
reviews on the effects of HAI in educational settings specifically focussing on the perceived
benefits to children of reading to dogs. With rising popularity and implementation of these
programmes in schools, it is essential that the evidence base exploring the pedagogic value
of these initiatives is well documented.
Methods
Using PRISMA guidelines we systematically investigated the literature reporting the peda-
gogic effects of reading to dogs. Because research in this area is in the early stages of sci-
entific enquiry we adopted broad inclusion criteria, accepting all reports which discussed
measurable effects related to the topic that were written in English. Multiple online data-
bases were searched during January-March 2015; grey literature searches were also con-
ducted. The search results which met the inclusion criteria were evaluated, and discussed,
in relation to the Oxford Centre for Evidence Based Medicine levels of evidence; 27 papers
were classified as Level 5, 13 as Level 4, 7 as Level 2c and 1 as Level 2b.
Conclusion
The evidence suggests that reading to a dog may have a beneficial effect on a number of
behavioural processes which contribute to a positive effect on the environment in which
reading is practiced, leading to improved reading performance. However, the evidence
base on which these inferences are made is of low quality. There is a clear need for the use
of higher quality research methodologies and the inclusion of appropriate controls in order
to draw causal inferences on whether or how reading to dogs may benefit children’s reading
practices. The mechanisms for any effect remain a matter of conjecture.

 Introduction
Literacy skills have significant consequences to global health and economy. More than 796 mil-
lion people in the world cannot read (approximately 15% of the population), resulting in
world-wide costs of over USD $1 trillion a year, with the effects of illiteracy being very similar
in developing and developed countries [1]. Poor literacy skills have substantial health and wel-
fare implications for society, having been associated with reduction in: health outcomes, eco-
nomic growth, social participation, self-esteem and hygiene, as well as increased accidents and
job absenteeism [2]. It is clear that reading skills have wide-reaching implications. Likewise, in
the educational environment the effects of literacy are not just relevant to performance in
English lessons, but also have wider implications, determining successful academic learning in
all subjects [3] and being associated with overall school enjoyment [4]. In the past decade there
has been a worrying decline in children’s enjoyment, and therefore frequency, of reading [5].
Given that frequency of reading is directly related to reading attainment [3] it is essential that
there are evidence-based interventions that increase children’s motivation, enjoyment and fre-
quency of reading. Despite increasing Government awareness for the necessity of improving
student’s motivation to read for pleasure [6] there is still no legitimised program to support
this.
The first high profile programme to advocate children reading to dogs was established in
1999 by Intermountain Therapy Animals, who announced Reading Education Assistance Dogs
(READ). Growing interest in reading to dog’s programmes such as READ is observed in fre-
quent media reports and is reflected in the subsequent development of a number of initiatives
around the world including (but not limited to), The Bark and Read Foundation (Kennel Club,
UK), Caring Canines, Dogs Helping Kids, Read2Dogs, Classroom Canines (Delta Society, Aus-
tralia), SitStayRead, Library Dogs, Tail Waggin’ Tutors (Therapy Dogs International), Reading
with Rover, and All Ears Reading.
Proponents of READ postulate that reading to dogs helps motivate children to read by
increasing relaxation and confidence, reducing blood pressure and offering a non-judgemental,
safe environment in which to practice reading [7–8]. It is noted that READ (and similar organi-
sations) do not supply evidence through control group comparisons to support these claims.
However, in the wider literature there is evidence to suggest that improving reading motivation
improves reading performance [9–11] indicating that if children are more motivated to read
with a dog then this could improve their reading abilities. This may be especially important for
students who struggle to read, because poor reading abilities are also associated with low read-
ing motivation [4]. Also, below average readers often demonstrate increased reading anxiety;
indeed, reading anxiety is a well observed form of ‘classical conditioning’ in the classroom envi-
ronment [12]. For example, an initially neutral stimulus (e.g., reading out-loud) is repeatedly
associated with a negative response (e.g., teacher judgement or peer ridicule), which results in
the reader forming an association between reading and negative internal responses (e.g. anxi-
ety, heightened emotions). Reading anxiety is common in children and is associated with phys-
ical symptoms, such as a reddening face, rapid breathing and tension headaches [13]. Evidence
suggests that positive experiences can help the child to overcome negative associations and be
more open to learning experiences [14] READ and similar programmes postulate that reading
to a dog helps to overcome these (anxiety / motivation) roadblocks to developing reading
expertise in the classroom. The silent companionship of a dog as a reading partner may allow
the child to work at their own pace through reading challenges without fear of being judged.
However, it is unclear what evidence exists to directly support the principles of READ (i.e.,
improved reading abilities through increased reading motivation and reduced reading anxiety).

to this paper. NRG worked on the paper in a research
capacity, not in a commercial capacity. The affiliation
with WALTHAM does not alter the authors’
adherence to PLOS ONE policies on sharing data
and materials.
 The objective of this systematic review was to determine the scientific evidence base for
the pedagogic effects of reading to dog’s programmes. We specifically focused on dependent
measures such as reading speed and comprehension and/or learning behaviours in this eval-
uation of the available evidence. The aim was to objectively represent the current state of this
developing field and in so doing we discuss all reports that investigated the reading abilities
of children (under 16 years) in response to a reading to dog programme, even if they did not
include a comparison group or use standardised tests. To illustrate the broad levels of scien-
tific quality of the current data we report the finding in three stages; stage 1: results published
in non-peer reviewed resources; stage 2: results published in peer-reviewed journals, but do
not report original data; stage 3: reports of original data in a peer-reviewed journal, classified
according to the hierarchy of evidence used by the Oxford Centre for Evidence Based Medi-
cine (OCEBM) [15].
Methods
The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guide-
lines were adhered to perform this systematic review [16] (S1 Appendix). No registered proto-
col exists for this review. The inclusion criteria for selection of articles included (a) literature
that reports reading and/or behavioural effects of children (under 16 years, with or without a
reading or developmental disability) reading to (in the presence of) dogs, and (b) articles writ-
ten in English. With the aim of providing a comprehensive review of the current relevant litera-
ture we limited the number of specific restrictions for inclusion. We did not stipulate the
nature (design details) of the intervention apart from ‘reading out-loud to dogs’, we included
reports that collected data from a single time point, as well as studies that explore the effect of
the intervention over time. We included reports that used both quantitative and qualitative
measures of effect, including ad-hoc reports, making no stipulation on the use of outcome
measures.
Literature searches were conducted in PubMed (1946-present), Science Direct (1946-pres-
ent), American Doctoral Dissertations (1933–1955), Canadian Reference Centre (1901-pres-
ent), Education Source (1900-present), ERIC (1966-present), Health Source: Nursing/
Academic Edition (1952-present), MasterfilePremier (1921-present), PsycArticles (1984-pres-
ent), PsychInfo (1987-present), Psychology & Behavioural Sciences Collection (1930-present),
Social Sciences Full Text (1972-present), SocIndex with Full Text (1985-present) and Google
Scholar (1946-present). In order to increase coverage, grey literature searches were conducted
(search for relevant references used in the articles that were selected in stage 3). Table 1 con-
tains the list of search terms used. Search terms were identified through analysis of commonly

 referred to key terms and titles in articles pertaining to reading to dogs. Full text articles were
sourced for all references electronically, or via direct contact with the authors.
Results
The initial literature searches, using the terms specified in Table 1 returned 149,218 results,
with an additional 14 references obtained from grey literature searches contributing to a total
of 149,232 references (Fig 1). After removing the topics that were not relevant to the aim of this
paper and duplications of the maintained papers (S2 Appendix), 48 results were assessed
against the OCEBM levels of evidence [15]. The OCEBM levels of evidence are designed to
alert practitioners to the quality of evidence on which conclusions are based. The levels of evi-
dence include: 1a: Systematic reviews (with homogeneity of variance) of Randomised Control

 Trials (RCTs). 1b: Individual RCTs with narrow confidence interval. 1c: All or none case series.
2a: Systematic reviews (with homogeneity) of cohort studies. 2b: Individual cohort studies,
including low quality RCTs. 2c: Outcomes research, ecological studies. 3a: Systematic review
(with homogeneity) of case-control studies. 3b: Individual case-control study. 4: Case series
(and poor quality cohort and case control studies). 5: Expert opinion without explicit critical
appraisal, or based on physiology, bench research or “first principles”. The authors (SSH,
DSM) independently classified the papers with the OCEBM criteria and then met to discuss
their ratings and resolve any discrepancies (step 1). NRG reviewed the ratings assigned (step
2), before submitting for independent review by two researchers not involved in any stage of
the manuscript (step 3). No discrepancies occurred in stages 2 and 3. Discrepancies in stage 1
were not common, and involved a difference in rating by no more than 1 level. All discrepan-
cies were resolved by reading the paper again to clarify understanding of the design and
procedures.
Twenty-seven papers were ranked level 5, thirteen papers were ranked level 4, seven papers
were ranked 2c, and one paper was ranked 2b. Specific details of the literature discussed can be
found in Table 2 and Table 3.
OCEBM Classification Level 5
Level 5 Evidence is “Expert opinion without explicit critical appraisal, or based on physiology,
bench research or first principles” [15]. The majority of literature that met the search criteria
was classified as Level 5 evidence (n = 27, 56%). Typically, these documents detailed ad-hoc
reports of the effects of reading to a dog as evidenced by classroom teachers, or dog handlers.
Many of the documents associated reading to a dog with behavioural changes, particularly,
greater motivation to read to a dog, improved confidence when reading to a dog, and reduced
signs of anxiety when reading to a dog [17–34]. Some documents also indicated that children
reported feeling more supported when reading to a dog [22, 25, 35–38]. References to improve-
ments in actual reading abilities were also noted, but not as frequently as changes to beha-
vioural processes [19, 20, 24, 26–28, 31, 32, 37, 39–42]. Only a small number of documents
made reference to any standardised tests that were used when making these judgements [40,
42]. A disengaged reader was reported as showing improvements on the Neale Analysis of
Reading Ability (NARA) after taking part in a reading to a dog programme [42], and a child
with autism spectrum disorder was reported as improving on the Dynamic Indicators of Early
Literacy Skills (DIBELS) and Elementary Reading Attitudes Scale (ERAS) after completing a
reading to a dog intervention [40]. However, these case studies did not use any control mea-
sures, or included a case series, and therefore were categorised as Level 5 evidence. These stud-
ies show some promise that reading to a dog can benefit children’s reading abilities by altering
key behavioural process which may be important in contributing to an optimal learning envi-
ronment, specifically, by increasing reading motivation and confidence, and reducing reading
anxiety.
OCEBM Classification Level 4
Level 4 evidence is classified as “Case series, and poor quality cohort and case control studies”.
Thirteen papers (27%) of the documents were classified as Level 4 evidence. Six of the 13
studies were case series studies that followed the progress of a small group of children as they
took part in a reading to a dog intervention, but did not use standardised measures to assess
the effects of the programme [43–48]. Four of the studies were based on children with reading
disabilities, or below average reading skills [44, 45, 47, 48], one study involved children with
autism spectrum disorder [43], and one study did not report the developmental status of their

 population [46]. These case studies reported improved reading abilities when reading to a dog,
as measured by teacher opinion or reading grade [44, 45, 47, 48]. Alterations to reading behav-
iours were also documented, including, improved reading confidence [44, 47], greater attention
when reading, improved attendance to reading lessons [47], more positive attitude to reading
[46] and increased social initiations when reading [43].
Five of the 13 papers classified as Level 4 evidence used standard tests to measure the effects
of reading to a dog on a case series group of children, but did not include control conditions.
The tests used included, the AIMSweb Curriculum Based Measurement [49], the Informal
Reading Inventory [50], the Grey Oral Reading Test [51], the Test of Reading Comprehension
and Measures of Academic Progress [52] and the Behavioural Observation of Students in
School [53]. Three of the studies measured the effects of reading to a dog on a-typically devel-
oping children, with reading disabilities [49], learning disabilities [50], or emotional and beha-
vioural problems [53]. The studies reported that reading to a dog has a positive effect on
reading abilities, improving reading fluency [49, 51] and enhancing reading comprehension
[52]. Evidence of positive alterations to behavioural processes were also documented, includ-
ing, improved reading motivation [50], reading confidence [49], reading attitude and enjoy-
ment [49–51] and increased engagement and on-task behaviours [49, 53].

 Two of the 13 papers classified as Level 4 evidence implemented control procedures, in
terms of using a repeated measures design [54], and a control group condition [55], but did not
use standard measures to assess the effects of reading to a dog. The first of these papers
reported that after reading to a dog children changed their implicit theories of reading ability,
which may lead to a positive attitude to reading lessons [54]. The second paper reported that
children who read to a dog improved on specific reading skills, including the ability to identify,
explore, define, analyse, predict and summarise when reading, in comparison to a group of
children who did not read to a dog [55].
The studies classified as Level 4 evidence support the conclusions made based on the Level 5
evidence; reading to a dog may enhance a child’s reading environment, by increasing reading
motivation and confidence, reducing anxiety, increasing task engagement and reading attitude.
There is some evidence to suggest that after children take part in a reading to a dog programme
they improve their scores on reading tests; however, such conclusions need to be assessed in
relation to appropriate control conditions for this to be taken with a degree of confidence.

 OCEBM Classification Level 2c
Level 2c evidence is “Outcomes research”. The search documents have been classified as Level
2c evidence if they clearly state the outcome of reading to a dog, using standard tests and in
relation to a control group or condition, using consistently applied reference standards (with-
out which the data would be classified as Level 3b). No evidence was classified as Level 3a,
because no systematic reviews were identified.
Seven papers (15%) were classified as Level 2c evidence for the effects of children reading to
dogs. All of the papers used a standard or objective approach to measure the effects of reading
to a dog. None of the papers reported effect sizes and some failed to report either descriptive or
inferential statistics. Five of these seven papers assessed the effects of reading to a dog in com-
parison to a control group [56–60]. One of the five papers assessed the effects of reading to a
dog with children with learning disabilities [60]; the remaining four did not specify the devel-
opmental status of their population. Two of the five papers that used a control group compari-
son found no significant effects of reading to a dog on performance on the Degrees of Reading
Power test [58] and a Pearson-Scott Foreman reading test [56]. However, the first mentioned
study only assessed reading ability after taking part in a five-day intervention [58], and the
other failed to record the duration of the intervention [56].
Two of the five papers reported a statistically significant increase in reading abilities as mea-
sured by the Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills [59] and Grey Oral Reading Test
[60] in children who took part in a reading to a dog programme. Only one of these studies
included the reading performance of the control group in the statistical analysis, and used a co-
variate analysis to control for reading performance at baseline [59]. This study reported that
the end of program totals for oral reading fluency, after being adjusted for baseline perfor-
mance were 78.38 (mean reading fluency) for the intervention group and 71.04 for the control
group. The authors do not state whether these are high or low scores on this test.
The second study referred to conducted a t-test analysis of pre and post intervention reading
ability separately for the intervention and control group [60]. This study reported an increase
in mean reading performance on the GORT for the intervention group (reading rate increase
of: 1.78 (Pre-test: 5.44 ± 2.18; Post-test: 7.22 ± 2.33; p = 0.007), reading accuracy increase of:
3.34 (Pre-test: 5.66 ± 1.80; Post-test: 9.0 ± 1.58; p = 0.001), reading fluency increase of: 2.88
(Pre-test: 5.0 ± 1.87; Post-test: 7.88 ± 2.08, p = 0.002]), reading comprehension increase of: 1.89
(Pre-test: 7.44 ± 1.59; Post-test: 9.33 ± 1.32, p = 0.000), oral reading quotient increase of: 14.16
(Pre-test: 77.5 ± 10.46; Post-test: 91.66 ± 9.22, p = 0.001); NB: Descriptive statistics on ranges
were not presented in the paper)). However, mean figures were not provided for the control
group, therefore, even a visual inspection of differences between the control and intervention
group cannot be made. Furthermore, without the use of case matching it is important that
appropriate statistical techniques are employed to control for differences in reading levels at
baseline between intervention and control groups.
One study assessed the effects of reading to a dog over school summer vacation. This small
pilot study found no statically significant differences as a result of the programme, however
this could be due to the small sample size (9 children in the intervention group and 9 children
in the control group). Indeed, the authors observed that children in the control group (who
read to a human alone) showed trends to reduced reading ability and poorer reading attitudes
over the summer vacation, than children who were reading to a dog. No effect sizes or mean
values were reported to support this statement, although visual inspection of the graphed data
indicates that the control group showed a reduction in reading ability (words per minute) that
was double that shown by the intervention group. The authors also noted that no children

 dropped out of the intervention group, but attendance was reduced over time in the control
group [57].
The final two out of the seven papers classified at Level 2c used a repeated measures design
to assess the effects of reading to a dog. One paper reported the effects of 12 children reading to
a dog, in comparison to reading to a human alone, using repeated measures, cross over design
[61]. They report a clear documentation of how they assessed reading ability, despite not using
a standardised reading test. They observed that when children read to a dog they performed
better on tasks including word recognition (Dog: 96.45±0.79; Mean±SD, Control: 94.83±1.67)
recognitions of punctuation marks (Dog: 82.84±7.60; Control: 70.73±8.76), and use of line
breaks (Dog: 79.66±4.50; Control: 71.93±7.97). These improvements were not statistically
significant.
The second paper which used repeated measures, cross over design measured physiological
responses (blood pressure) of 38 children when they were with a dog and engaging in reading
and when they were resting, and when they were not with a dog and reading and resting [62].
The presence of the dog reduced blood pressure when the children were reading and when
they were resting. Although the study did not assess what effect this change in anxiety had on
reading performance, it does represent the first study to apply objective, physiological, mea-
sures to assess the effects of reading to a dog on child anxiety levels.
These studies, classified at Level 2c, support the conclusions drawn from Level 5 and Level 4
evidence. Reading to dogs may bring about changes to children’s behavioural processes, which
has a positive impact on the environment in which reading is practiced and in turn facilitates
reading performance.
OCEBM Classification Level 2b
Level 2b evidence includes “Individual cohort studies, including low quality randomised con-
trol trials.”
One paper (2%) returned from the search procedures was classified as Level 2b evidence. Le
Roux et al. [63] randomly assigned 102 third grade students from one school, who were identi-
fied as poor readers, to one of four conditions. The study does not document whether any sta-
tistical procedures were used to calculate the required sample size, and instead appears to be
based on a convenience based sampling of the population. Twenty-seven students read to a
dog (through Pets as Therapy teams), 24 read to an adult, 26 read to a teddy bear with an adult
and 25 students were in a control group that did not include a reading intervention. Reading
ability was measured using the Neale Analysis of Reading Ability at baseline (Time 1), after the
10-week programme (Time 2) and eight weeks later (Time 3). The intervention ran for 10
weeks and each session lasted for 20 minutes. The authors state that there was no significant
difference between reading abilities of the four groups at baseline, but no inferential or descrip-
tive statistics are reported to support this statement, nor were appropriate statistical techniques
employed to control for differences between the populations. Indeed, visual inspection of their
figures (p665) shows that reading comprehension was higher in the dog group than the other
groups at baseline [63]. No significant effects of group were reported between the time points.
However, over all time points reading rate was significantly better in the dog group
(7.94 ± 0.96) compared to the teddy bear group (7.45 ± 0.79) with a medium effect size
reported (η² = 0.09). Both reading accuracy and reading comprehension were better in the dog
group (reading accuracy: 7.73 ± 1.13; reading comprehension: 7.29 ± 0.13) compared to the
adult group, teddy bear group (reading accuracy: 7.21 ± 0.78; reading comprehension:
6.59 ± 0.80) and control group (reading accuracy: 7.28 ± 0.77; reading comprehension:
6.74 ± 0.83) with large effect sizes (reading accuracy: η² = 0.13; reading comprehension: η² =

 0.15) Demographic information for each student was collected, but not reported in the paper.
It is important that studies report demographic information to evaluate to whom reading to
dogs may be most beneficial for. This study shows promise for reading to dog programmes for
struggling readers, but does not consider the potential mechanisms involved in this process.
Discussion
In this discussion we first consider to what extent the existing evidence base, reported in this
review paper, supports the pedagogical value of reading to dogs. We also discuss potential
mechanisms that may be involved when reading to a dog. We draw upon the literature pre-
sented here as well as including broader literature from the animal-assisted intervention (AAI)
field, to suggest how reading to a dog may affect reading performance.
The 48 studies that met the search criteria described positive effects of children reading to
dogs. In particular, the papers evidenced improvements to the children’s behavioural processes,
which may improve the environment in which reading is practiced, and therefore lead to better
reading performance. However, the quality of the evidence on which these conclusions are
drawn is low, with the majority categorised at the lowest level (Level 5) on the OCEBM criteria
[15]. Much of the evidence is based on ad-hoc reports that have not been through a peer-review
process. Conclusions are typically based on inferences from small sample sizes. Additionally,
studies do not use blind scoring, fail to consider longitudinal durability of the changes
observed, do not sufficiently control for baseline scores or appropriately randomly allocate
children to intervention or control groups. Only one report claims to have conducted a rando-
mised control trial [63], but given the relatively small sample size in each group, the quality of
evidence remains low.
It is clear that future research in this area should prioritise using standardised measures to
assess the effects of reading to a dog. Few studies use measures that have clear documentation
of their validity and reliability, indeed few studies even use standard measures as used in educa-
tional practice, and instead rely on subjective judgements, such as teacher opinion. Further-
more, no studies use standardised scales to assess the relationship between reading
performance and behavioural processes, which is important to help understand how reading to
a dog programme may benefit children. Such an evaluation would also help us to identify
which children may be most likely to benefit from taking part in these programmes and there-
fore lead to the development of clinically and economically effective practices. In a similar
light, in order to develop codes of conduct of best practice and a reading to dog’s curriculum it
is essential that future reports and scientific investigations document details of the interven-
tion, including the number of sessions, duration of the sessions, details of the dog(s) and demo-
graphic variables of the children (e.g. age, disability status, and experience with dogs).
Despite the criticisms that can be levelled at the existing evidence base, there is clear docu-
mentation that reading to a dog has the potential to bring significant improvements to chil-
dren’s reading abilities, and therefore deserves further investigation. Based on figures provided
by informal communications with registered school dog organisations, a trained dog and han-
dler can assist a child to read for one year for around £60 (GBP). If volunteer handlers are
involved, as is often the case, this figure reduces to around £16 (GBP). When considering the
current global costs of illiteracy [1, 2], reading to dog’s programs may represent a unique, cost
effect strategy which could be implemented into a broader reading curriculum. However,
before the practice of reading to dogs is adopted into mainstream education it is vital that the
practice is subject to greater scientific scrutiny in order to evaluate how these programmes may
benefit children, and if these gains are of clinical significance. Such evaluations are also impor-
tant in developing specific reading curricula. Much of the current practice in reading to dogs

 occurs without specific guidelines, or evidence of documented lesson plans. For educators and
policy makers to recognise the value of reading to dog’s programmes it is important that curric-
ula are developed which have clear and measurable learning goals.
How might Reading to Dogs Improve Reading Abilities?
Many of the papers listed in this review make reference to students demonstrating a change in
behavioural processes during reading to dog’s programmes (Table 2). Such a change is taken as
an indication that reading to dogs may improve the wider learning environment for children,
which may improve reading performance. In Fig 2 we provide a graphical description as to
how reading to a dog may influence behavioural processes, enhancing the learning environ-
ment and ultimately leading to improved reading performance.
The processes which are outlined in Fig 2 are evidenced in the wider field of human-animal
interactions as being processes which can change in the presence of an animal.
Top-down processes. There is evidence to suggest that animal-assisted therapy (AAT)
with children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) produces increased displays of positive
attitudes and feelings, as evidenced by increased smiling and laughing [82, 83] and decreased
problematic behaviours [83]. Similar improvements have been observed in classroom situation
[84], which has led some to suggest that a classroom dog may improve a child’s attitude to
school [85]. However, these classroom studies, like the reading to dog’s studies are based on
small-scale subjective observations and do not include a control group. Gee and colleagues
have conducted a series of controlled laboratory-based investigations to explore the impact of
the presence of a dog on a range of children’s cognitive and motor tasks [86–90]. These studies
found that with a dog, compared to without a dog, young children perform motor tasks faster
without sacrificing accuracy [86], require less assistance with a memory task, potentially dem-
onstrating improved concentration [87], require fewer instructional prompts to complete imi-
tation tasks [88], show fewer errors on a cognitive task [89], and show improved object
recognition [90]. These studies imply that a dog may improve the motivation of children to
engage and accurately complete set tasks.
Confidence. McConnell et al. [91] provide one of the most recent studies to suggest that
animals can improve confidence (defined here as including the constructs of self-esteem and
self-concept); with adult pet owners scoring higher on Rosenberg’s [92] scale of self-esteem
than non-pet owners. However, it is difficult to determine a causal effect, in that people self-
select for pet ownership status so it is possible that people with high self-esteem may be more
likely to choose to own a pet, rather than pet ownership increasing low self-esteem. There
appears to be little research that has explored how pet dogs may affect child confidence, yet
this could prove to be an important mechanism in determining how dogs may benefit chil-
dren’s educational achievement. Nonetheless, one study of 130 adolescents showed that those
who owned a pet have greater self-esteem than those who did not [93], but again, it is difficult
to infer causation. Only a single conference paper shows a possible causal effect of the dog over
time (as opposed to population selection bias) with the addition of a classroom pet improving
self-esteem in children over a nine-month period in comparison to a control group [94].
Anxiety. The moderating effects of dogs on human anxiety and stress are a re-occurring
theme in AAT literature [95–97]. Although ad-hoc reports indicate that anxiety reducing
effects are observed in the context of classroom dogs to date there is insufficient evidence of
appropriate quality to support this claim, but neither is there evidence to deny it. Evidence
from physiological indicators of anxiety have the advantage of being free from experimenter
bias, but often relate to general arousal rather than a specific state and show a lack of consensus
as to whether dogs have an excitatory effect, a calming effect, or no effect. For instance,

 Fig 2. An Illustration of how Reading to a Dog may Influence Reading Performance. 1Increased arousal can heighten cognitive performance on some
tasks [64, 65]. Whether increased our decreased arousal results in optimal performance is typically determined by the individual and the nature of the task
(see Individual Zone of Optimal Functioning) [66, 67] 2Reading anxiety (over-arousal) can impair children’s reading performance in the classroom [12] by
negatively impacting on cognitive processes involved in reading, including problem-solving and self-regulation [68, 69]. 3 A reader’s self-concept or
confidence in their reading ability determines reading practices [70], by influencing the amount of time and the degree of effort which is put into reading [71].
There is a positive relationship between reading self-concept and reading achievement [72, 73]. The dynamics of the relationship between self-concept and
achievement is still debated it is thought to be reciprocal, with greater achievement raising student’s self-concept, as well as higher self-concept leading to
improved academic achievements [74]. 4There is an association between reading attitudes and reading performance in children, with those who have a
positive attitude doing better in reading tests than those who have a negative attitude [75, 76]. Attitudes towards reading are thought to influence attainment
by determining reading behaviours (e.g. frequency of reading) [70]. 5In reading studies motivation is often discussed in terms of intrinsic motivation
(motivated from within; e.g., curiosity to read, enjoyment of the experience) and extrinsic (motivated by external factors; e.g., to get a good grade) [77, 78].

 Somervill et al. [98] reported a significant increase in the blood pressure and heart rate of 17
children diagnosed with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) after handling a dog.
It is noted that the authors did not include a familiarisation period with the dog, indeed the
child only spent one five-minute session with the dog, and the child was not given a structured
task to do to focus their attention. Other studies suggest that the presence of a dog may reduce
physiological parameters of stress, decreasing blood pressure when reading to a dog [62] and
reducing cortisol awakening in children with insecure attachment [99] and with autism [100].
These effects were observed in comparison to a control condition. A recent study showed that
physical contact with a dog during a stressful working memory task did not significantly alter
the heart-rate variability of undergraduate students in comparison to contact with a stuffed toy
or another human [101], suggesting that dogs do not reliably influence humans physiological
stress responses. It is noted that that this study used adult rather than child participants which
leaves open the possibility that dogs may be more effective at reducing child, compared to
adult, physiological reactions. A further possibility is that dogs only reduce physiological
arousal in a specific population. Comparisons of children’s skin conductivity responses showed
that the presence of a dog reduced arousal in children with ASD, but increased arousal in typi-
cally developing children in one study [102]. It is clear that further research is needed to estab-
lish whether children’s reading to dogs modulates physiological measures of arousal in general
or anxiety specifically, and whether decreases (e.g. a calming effect) or increases (e.g. height-
ened arousal and attention) are most conducive to the learning environment.
Social Support.
The social support hypothesis is often mentioned in the study of animal
companionship, with evidence suggesting that animals offer social support themselves, as well
as acting as ‘social lubricants’ to facilitate interactions with other humans [81, 91, 103–105].
Indeed, ad-hoc reports suggest that the non-threatening, non-judgemental presence of a dog
improves children’s feelings of support during reading [24]. Although the influence of dogs on
young children’s perception of social support is largely under-explored, Beetz et al. [99]
reported that children, aged 7–11 years, experience greater levels of support in a stressful social
situation in the presence of a dog than a friendly human. Further research is needed to investi-
gate these effects in educational environments.
Engagement.
The notion of animals affecting our attention and engagement is related to
the commonly cited biophilia hypothesis in animal companionship research. This states that
humans have developed to attend to living systems, including animals, due to an innate drive
to be close to other living things, perhaps for safety and/or because of the positive feelings asso-
ciated with learning about the living world [106, 107]. Evidence to support this is observed in
studies which show that adults show faster identification of visual changes to scenes that con-
tain animals or humans than those that contain inanimate objects, when controlling for dyna-
micity of the scenes [108]. More specifically, a study has shown that children preferred to
interact with, and showed greater attention to, animals in comparison to stimulating toys
[109]. Additional evidence supporting the effect of dogs to improve a child’s attention and
engagement comes from a clinical study highlighting a reduction in problematic attention/defi-
cit-hyperactivity symptoms in children diagnosed with attention/deficit-hyperactivity disorder
(AD/HD) when participating in a canine-assisted intervention [110]. The studies reported by
Gee and colleagues provide some evidence to suggest that dogs may help typically developing
Although both factors are thought to play in role in influencing reading behaviours, intrinsic motivation is thought to be the key determiner [78–80].
6Engagement in reading is often associated with motivation. According to Guthrie and Wigfield [81] reading motivation is an interaction with text that is both
motivated and strategic, engaged reading is related to reading comprehension success, and engaged reading can be improved by instructional practices that
use motivational and cognitive strategies.

 children to engage in structured tasks, similar to that required in classroom lessons [86–89].
However, children’s willingness to respond to animals, or desire to be close to them, is likely to
be mediated by individual differences and life experiences as well as an innate drive. Those
individuals with less positive perceptions or experiences with animals are less likely to show
improvements through animal interactions [111, 112]. Given the frequent negative portrayals
of animals in the media (e.g. regarding dog bites) the effect of negative experience may be a
more important issue that warrants careful consideration in both practice and experimental
design.
In summary, the evidence suggests that reading to a dog has a positive impact on the learn-
ing environment in which reading is practiced. However, based on our classifications using the
OCEBM the quality of this evidence is poor. We recognise that despite using an objective clas-
sification system we cannot rule out bias in our judgement when assigning classifications. With
the aim of reducing this potential bias all members of the team met to discuss classifications.
Additionally, we sought independent opinions from two additional research professionals; no
discrepancies occurred. We are unable to provide effect sizes for the majority of the results dis-
cussed in this paper, due to poor design and reporting procedures. For this reason, and because
of the lack of Randomised Control Trials (RCTs) identified through the searches, it was not
possible or relevant to conduct a meta-analysis on the data. As well as representing a critique
point for this systematic review it highlights the current state of the art, with need for greater
scientific rigour in this field. Nonetheless, there is some evidence from wider HAI field to sup-
port the conclusion. Drawing upon the wider field provides some convergent validity for the
practice of reading to dogs, but the conclusions should still be interpreted with caution.
Although outside of the scope of this paper, much of the existing HAI research can also be sub-
ject to a number of criticisms. These problems further highlight the need for future studies in
this field to include rigorous controls and high quality scientific designs such as large scale ran-
domised control trials in order to systematically explore, and understand, the impact of HAI.
Summary and Conclusion
This paper presents the first systematic review exploring the value of HAI in educational prac-
tice, specifically the practice of reading to dogs. The review highlights the plausibility of reading
to dogs to bring improvements to children’s reading abilities and beneficially alter behavioural
and emotional processes which may be important aspects in creating a learning environment
to best cultivate reading skills.
However, there is a clear need for more rigorous investigation in this area. Large scale ran-
domised control trials, with longitudinal examinations of effects are needed to improve the
quality of the evidence base of the research and to further our theoretical understanding of the
underlying mechanisms impacted by the dog presence as well as the effective implementation
of such programmes. It is important that studies use appropriate sample sizes to enable confi-
dence in the detection of meaningful effects. Additionally, there is a need for practitioners and
researchers to work together to evaluate specific reading to dog’s curricula in order to ensure
any benefits are maximised and studies comparable.
