SUMMARY
Atrophy of neurons in the prefrontal cortex (PFC)
plays a key role in the pathophysiology of depression
and
related
disorders.
The
ability
to
promote
both structural and functional plasticity in the PFC
has been hypothesized to underlie the fast-acting
antidepressant properties of the dissociative anes-
thetic ketamine. Here, we report that, like ketamine,
serotonergic psychedelics are capable of robustly
increasing neuritogenesis and/or spinogenesis both
in vitro and in vivo. These changes in neuronal struc-
ture are accompanied by increased synapse number
and function, as measured by fluorescence micro-
scopy and electrophysiology. The structural changes
induced by psychedelics appear to result from stim-
ulation of the TrkB, mTOR, and 5-HT2A signaling
pathways and could possibly explain the clinical
effectiveness of these compounds. Our results un-
derscore the therapeutic potential of psychedelics
and, importantly, identify several lead scaffolds for
medicinal chemistry efforts focused on developing
plasticity-promoting compounds as safe, effective,
and
fast-acting
treatments
for
depression
and
related disorders.
INTRODUCTION
Neuropsychiatric diseases, including mood and anxiety disor-
ders, are some of the leading causes of disability worldwide
and place an enormous economic burden on society (Gus-
tavsson et al., 2011; Whiteford et al., 2013). Approximately
one-third of patients will not respond to current antidepressant
drugs, and those who do will usually require at least 2–4 weeks
of treatment before they experience any beneficial effects
(Rush et al., 2006). Depression, post-traumatic stress disorder
(PTSD), and addiction share common neural circuitry (Arnsten,
2009; Russo et al., 2009; Peters et al., 2010; Russo and
Nestler, 2013) and have high comorbidity (Kelly and Daley,
2013). A preponderance of evidence from a combination of
human imaging, postmortem studies, and animal models sug-
gests that atrophy of neurons in the prefrontal cortex (PFC)
plays a key role in the pathophysiology of depression and
related disorders and is precipitated and/or exacerbated by
stress (Arnsten, 2009; Autry and Monteggia, 2012; Christoffel
et al., 2011; Duman and Aghajanian, 2012; Duman et al.,
2016; Izquierdo et al., 2006; Pittenger and Duman, 2008;
Qiao et al., 2016; Russo and Nestler, 2013). These structural
changes, such as the retraction of neurites, loss of dendritic
spines, and elimination of synapses, can potentially be coun-
teracted by compounds capable of promoting structural and
functional neural plasticity in the PFC (Castre
´ n and Antila,
2017; Cramer et al., 2011; Duman, 2002; Hayley and Litteljohn,
2013; Kolb and Muhammad, 2014; Krystal et al., 2009;
Mathew et al., 2008), providing a general solution to treating
all of these related diseases. However, only a relatively small
number of compounds capable of promoting plasticity in the
PFC have been identified so far, each with significant draw-
backs (Castre
´ n and Antila, 2017). Of these, the dissociative
anesthetic ketamine has shown the most promise, revitalizing
the field of molecular psychiatry in recent years.
Ketamine has demonstrated remarkable clinical potential as a
fast-acting antidepressant (Berman et al., 2000; Ionescu et al.,
2016; Zarate et al., 2012), even exhibiting efficacy in treatment-
resistant populations (DiazGranados et al., 2010; Murrough
et al., 2013; Zarate et al., 2006). Additionally, it has shown prom-
ise for treating PTSD (Feder et al., 2014) and heroin addiction
(Krupitsky et al., 2002). Animal models suggest that its therapeu-
tic effects stem from its ability to promote the growth of dendritic
spines, increase the synthesis of synaptic proteins, and
strengthen synaptic responses (Autry et al., 2011; Browne and
Lucki, 2013; Li et al., 2010).

 Like ketamine, serotonergic psychedelics and entactogens
have demonstrated rapid and long-lasting antidepressant and
anxiolytic effects in the clinic after a single dose (Bouso et al.,
2008; Carhart-Harris and Goodwin, 2017; Grob et al., 2011;
Mithoefer et al., 2013, 2016; Nichols et al., 2017; Sanches
et al., 2016; Oso
´ rio et al., 2015), including in treatment-resistant
populations (Carhart-Harris et al., 2016, 2017; Mithoefer et al.,
2011; Oehen et al., 2013; Rucker et al., 2016). In fact, there
have been numerous clinical trials in the past 30 years examining
the therapeutic effects of these drugs (Dos Santos et al., 2016),
with 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) recently
receiving the ‘‘breakthrough therapy’’ designation by the Food
and Drug Administration for treating PTSD. Furthermore, clas-
sical psychedelics and entactogens produce antidepressant
and anxiolytic responses in rodent behavioral tests, such as
the forced swim test (Cameron et al., 2018) and fear extinction
learning (Cameron et al., 2018; Catlow et al., 2013; Young
et al., 2015), paradigms for which ketamine has also been shown
to be effective (Autry et al., 2011; Girgenti et al., 2017; Li et al.,
2010). Despite the promising antidepressant, anxiolytic, and
anti-addictive properties of serotonergic psychedelics, their
therapeutic mechanism of action remains poorly understood,
and concerns about safety have severely limited their clinical
usefulness.
Because of the similarities between classical serotonergic
psychedelics and ketamine in both preclinical models and clin-
ical studies, we reasoned that their therapeutic effects might
result from a shared ability to promote structural and functional
neural plasticity in cortical neurons. Here, we report that seroto-
nergic psychedelics and entactogens from a variety of chemical
classes (e.g., amphetamine, tryptamine, and ergoline) display
plasticity-promoting properties comparable to or greater than
ketamine. Like ketamine, these compounds stimulate structural
plasticity by activating the mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR). To classify the growing number of compounds capable
of rapidly promoting induced plasticity (Castre
´ n and Antila,
2017), we introduce the term ‘‘psychoplastogen,’’ from the
Greek roots psych- (mind), -plast (molded), and -gen (produc-
ing). Our work strengthens the growing body of literature indi-
cating that psychoplastogens capable of promoting plasticity
in the PFC might have value as fast-acting antidepressants
and anxiolytics with efficacy in treatment-resistant populations
and suggests that it may be possible to use classical psyche-
delics as lead structures for identifying safer alternatives.
RESULTS
Psychedelics Promote Neuritogenesis
Because atrophy of cortical neurons is believed to be a contrib-
uting factor to the development of mood and anxiety disorders
(Christoffel et al., 2011; Duman and Aghajanian, 2012), we first
treated cultured cortical neurons with psychedelics from a vari-
ety of structural classes (Figures 1A and S1A) and measured
the resulting changes in various morphological features. Using
Sholl analysis (Ristanovi�
c et al., 2006), we observed that several
psychedelics increased dendritic arbor complexity comparably
to ketamine, as measured by the area under the curve of the
Sholl plots as well as the maximum number of crossings (Figures
1B–1E and S1B–S1E). This increase in arbor complexity ap-
peared to result from large changes in both the number of den-
dritic branches and the total length of the arbors (Figures 1F,
1H, S1F, and S1H). Psychedelics had a limited effect on the num-
ber of primary dendrites and did not alter the length of the
longest dendrite (Figures 1G, 1I, S1G, and S1I).
Nearly all psychedelic compounds tested were capable of
robustly promoting neuritogenesis, with comparable effects be-
ing produced by tryptamines (N,N-dimethyltryptamine [DMT]
and psilocin), amphetamines (2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphet-
amine [DOI] and MDMA), and ergolines (lysergic acid diethyla-
mide [LSD]). As a positive control, we treated cells with 7,8-dihy-
droxyflavone (DHF), a psychoplastogen structurally dissimilar
to classical psychedelics (Jang et al., 2010), and found
that it also increased dendritic arbor complexity (Figure S2).
This neurite outgrowth structural phenotype seems to only
be induced by select compounds because serotonin and
D-amphetamine, molecules that are chemically related to
classical psychedelics and entactogens, exerted minimal to no
effects on neuritogenesis (Figure S2).
To establish the relative potencies and efficacies of hallucino-
gens and entactogens for promoting neurite outgrowth, we con-
ducted 8-point dose-response studies (Figure S3). We defined
100% and 0% efficacy as the maximum number of crossings
induced by ketamine (10 mM) and vehicle (0.1% DMSO), respec-
tively. We chose the 10 mM concentration of ketamine as the up-
per limit because this concentration of ketamine is reached in the
brain following intraperitoneal administration of an antidepres-
sant dose in rats (Yang et al., 2018). For consistency, we used
this same concentration when testing the effects of psychedelics
and entactogens, with DMT being the only exception. We used a
maximum 90 mM concentration of DMT in our studies to more
closely mimic the brain concentration of DMT in rats treated
with an antidepressant dose (Cohen and Vogel, 1972; Cameron
et al., 2018). In this neuritogenesis assay, ketamine’s half
maximal effective concentration (EC50) value was 132 nM. Sur-
prisingly, the majority of the psychedelics and entactogens we
tested exhibited significantly greater potency than ketamine,
with LSD being particularly potent (EC50 = 0.409 nM). In fact,
LSD exhibited activity across 8 orders of magnitude into the
low picomolar range (Figure S3).
Notably, the anti-addictive alkaloid ibogaine (Alper, 2001;
Belgers et al., 2016) was the only psychedelic tested that had
absolutely no effect (Figure S4). This was a surprising result
because we hypothesized that ibogaine’s long-lasting anti-
addictive properties might result from its psychoplastogenic
properties. Previous work by He et al. (2005) clearly demon-
strated that ibogaine increases the expression of glial cell line-
derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and that this plasticity-pro-
moting protein is critical to ibogaine’s anti-addictive mechanism
of action. Because several reports have suggested that noribo-
gaine, a metabolite of ibogaine, might actually be the active com-
pound in vivo (Zubaran et al., 1999; Baumann et al., 2000, 2001),
we decided to test its ability to promote neuritogenesis in
cultured cortical neurons. Gratifyingly, noribogaine robustly
increased dendritic arbor complexity with an EC50 value compa-
rable to ketamine (Figure S3), providing additional evidence sug-
gesting that it may be the active compound in vivo.

 To assess the in vivo effects of classical psychedelics on neu-
ritogenesis, we started treating Drosophila larvae during the first
instar with LSD and DOI. As observed in rodent cortical cultures,
both LSD and DOI significantly increased dendritic branching of
class I sensory neurons; however, they did not increase the total
length of the dendritic arbors (Figures 1J–1L). Because of the
striking effects of psychedelics on the structures of immature
neurons, we hypothesized that they might influence neurodevel-
opment. To test this, we chronically treated zebrafish embryos
with compounds for 6 days immediately following dechoriona-
tion and assessed gross morphological changes and behavior.
We did not observe any differences in head sizes between the
treatment groups, nor did we detect any statistically significant
differences in activity levels (Figure S5). Next we assessed the

 ability of psychedelics to promote neuritogenesis in more mature
neurons by starting to treat Drosophila larvae during the late sec-
ond instar. Again, psychedelics increased the branching of class
I neurons, although the effect was less dramatic than that
observed when treatment was started during the first instar (Fig-
ure 1M–1O). Although different developmental stages might be
more or less susceptible to the effects of psychedelics, it is
also possible that the smaller effect size observed after adminis-
tering compounds starting at the later time point was simply the
result of treating the larvae for a shorter period of time. Regard-
less, it was quite surprising to observe compound-induced
changes in neuronal structure after initiating treatment during
the late second instar because class I neurons are stereotyped
and typically possess relatively few higher-order branches
(Grueber et al., 2002). Moreover, our results demonstrate that
psychedelics can promote changes in neuronal structure
across vertebrate (rats) and invertebrate (Drosophila) species,
suggesting that they act through an evolutionarily conserved
mechanism.
Psychedelics Promote Spinogenesis and
Synaptogenesis
In addition to dendritic atrophy, loss of dendritic spines is a hall-
mark of depression and other neuropsychiatric disorders (Chris-
toffel et al., 2011; Duman and Aghajanian, 2012), so we next as-
sessed the effects of psychedelics on spinogenesis. We treated
mature rat cortical cultures for 24 hr with DOI, DMT, and LSD as
representative compounds from the amphetamine, tryptamine,
and ergoline classes of psychedelics, respectively. All three
compounds increased the number of dendritic spines per unit
length, as measured by super-resolution structured illumination
microscopy (SIM) (Figures 2A, 2B, and S6), with LSD nearly
doubling the number of spines per 10 mm. Additionally, treatment
caused a shift in spine morphology, favoring immature (thin and
filopodium) over more mature (mushroom) spine types (Fig-
ure 2C). Colocalization of pre- and postsynaptic markers
following treatment demonstrated that psychedelics promoted
synaptogenesis by increasing the density, but not the size of syn-
apses (Figure 2D–2F). This increase in synapse density was
accompanied by an increase in the density of VGLUT1 puncta,
but not PSD-95 puncta, following compound administration
(Figures 2G and 2H).
Encouraged by our in vitro results, we next assessed the ef-
fects of a single intraperitoneal dose of DMT on spinogenesis
in the PFC of adult rats using Golgi-Cox staining. We chose to
administer a 10 mg/kg dose of DMT for three reasons. First, all
available data suggested that this dose would produce halluci-
nogenic effects in rats with minimal safety risks (Glennon et al.,
1980, 1983; Glennon, 1999; Gatch et al., 2009; Smith et al.,
1998; Appel et al., 1999; Winter et al., 2007; Carbonaro et al.,
2015; Helsley et al., 1998; Strassman et al., 1994; Nair and
Jacob, 2016). Second, we have previously shown that a
10 mg/kg dose of DMT produces positive effects in rat behav-
ioral tests relevant to depression and PTSD (Cameron et al.,
2018). Finally, we wanted to directly compare the effects of
DMT with ketamine, and seminal studies conducted by Li et al.
(2010) had previously demonstrated that a 10 mg/kg dose of ke-
tamine produced a robust increase in dendritic spine density in
the PFC of rats. We observed a significant increase in the density
of dendritic spines on cortical pyramidal neurons 24 hr after
dosing with DMT (Figures 2I and 2J). This effect was comparable
with that produced by ketamine at the same dose (Figure 2J).
Importantly, this DMT-induced increase in dendritic spine
density was accompanied by functional effects. Ex vivo slice re-
cordings revealed that both the frequency and amplitude of
spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) were
increased following DMT treatment (Figures 2K–2M). Interest-
ingly, 10 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg doses produced similar responses
despite the fact that they are predicted to be hallucinogenic and
subhallucinogenic, respectively (Strassman et al., 1994; Nair and
Jacob, 2016).
Because the half-life of DMT is exceedingly short (�15 min),
these results confirm that structural and functional changes
induced by DMT persist for hours after the compound has
been cleared from the body. Moreover, they demonstrate that
DMT produces functional effects on pyramidal neurons of the
PFC that mirror those produced by ketamine (Li et al., 2010).
Because the PFC is a key brain region involved in extinction
learning (Quirk et al., 2006), and both ketamine and DMT have
been shown to facilitate fear extinction (Cameron et al., 2018;
Girgenti et al., 2017), our results suggest a link between the plas-
ticity-promoting and behavioral effects of these drugs. Because
fear extinction can be enhanced by increasing levels of brain-
derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the PFC (Peters et al.,
2010), and ketamine’s behavioral effects have been shown to
be BDNF-dependent (Lepack et al., 2014), we next sought to
determine the role of BDNF signaling in the plasticity-promoting
effects of classical psychedelics.
Psychedelics Promote Plasticity through a TrkB-
and mTOR-Dependent Mechanism
The role of BDNF in both neuritogenesis and spinogenesis is well
known (Cohen-Cory et al., 2010), and several reports suggest
that psychedelics are capable of increasing levels of neurotro-
phic factors (He et al., 2005; Martin et al., 2014; Nichols and
Sanders-Bush, 2002; Vaidya et al., 1997). Therefore, we treated
cortical neurons with BDNF, DOI, and a combination of the
two to see whether they had any additive or synergistic
effects.
Dose-response
studies
using
recombinant
BDNF
(Figures 3A–3C) revealed that a 50 ng/mL treatment increased
neuritogenesis to a comparable extent as DOI (10 mM). More-
over, a combination of the two did not confer any added benefit,
suggesting that they operate through a related mechanism
(Figures 3D–3F). Next, we treated cortical neurons with DOI,
DMT, and LSD for 24 hr before measuring BDNF gene and pro-
tein expression using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) and ELISA,
respectively. Although psychedelics did not increase the expres-
sion of BDNF transcript (Figure 3G), they did result in a 2-fold in-
crease in BDNF protein levels, although this effect was not sta-
tistically significant (Figure 3H). When cortical cultures were
co-treated with ANA-12 (Cazorla et al., 2011), a selective antag-
onist of BDNF’s high-affinity receptor TrkB, the ability of psyche-
delics or BDNF to stimulate neuritogenesis and spinogenesis
was completely blocked (Figure 4).
Activation of TrkB is known to promote signaling through
mTOR (Takei et al., 2004), which plays a key role in structural

 plasticity (Jaworski et al., 2005; Kumar et al., 2005), the produc-
tion of proteins necessary for synaptogenesis (Hoeffer and
Klann, 2010), and the effects of ketamine (Dwyer and Duman,
2013; Li et al., 2010). Treatment with rapamycin, an mTOR inhib-
itor, completely blocked psychedelic-induced neuritogenesis
(Figure 5), thus confirming that mTOR activation plays a role
in the plasticity-promoting effects of classical serotonergic
psychedelics.
The 5-HT2A Receptor Mediates the Effects of
Psychedelics on Structural Plasticity
Finally, we sought to determine whether the 5-HT2A receptor
played any role in the plasticity-promoting effects of DOI, DMT,
and LSD because this receptor is known to be primarily respon-
sible for the hallucinogenic effects of classical psychedelics (Nich-
ols, 2004, 2016). Furthermore, the psychoplastogenic potencies
of these and related compounds correlate well with their 5-HT2A
receptor affinities (Figure S3) (i.e., a higher 5-HT2A binding affinity
generally predicts more potent psychoplastogenic effects). Con-
trol experiments demonstrated that 5-HT2A receptors were ex-
pressed on cultured rat cortical neurons at both 6 days in vitro
(DIV6) and DIV19 (Figure 6A). Next we found that co-treatment
with ketanserin, a selective 5-HT2A antagonist, completely abro-
gated the ability of DMT, LSD, and DOI to promote both neurito-
genesis and spinogenesis (Figures 6B–6F). Ketanserin was also
able to block the effects of psilocin as well as the non-classical
psychedelic noribogaine and enactogen MDMA (Figure 6G).
These initial experiments were performed using doses of
psychoplastogens that produced maximal effects on struc-
tural plasticity (circa 10 mM) in combination with a 10-fold
excess of ketanserin (100 mM). At these concentrations, we
could not rule out the possibility of other receptors contrib-
uting to the antagonistic effects of ketanserin. Therefore, we
treated cultured cortical neurons with a significantly lower
dose of LSD (10 nM) and attempted to block its ability to pro-
mote neurite outgrowth using increasing doses of ketanserin
(Figure 6H). We found that ketanserin blocks the psychoplas-
togenic effects of LSD by �50% when treated at 10 nM. This
is consistent with the fact that the binding affinities of ketan-
serin and LSD for the 5-HT2A receptor are roughly equivalent
(low nanomolar). Increasing the concentration of ketanserin to
100 nM, 10-fold higher than the concentration of LSD used in
this experiment, completely prevented LSD-induced neurito-
genesis. At 100 nM, ketanserin is relatively selective for the
5-HT2A receptor, although, at this concentration, we cannot
rule out the possible involvement of 5-HT2C, adrenergic, or
histamine receptors.
As a final note, the concentration responses of most psy-
choplastogens had Hill slopes that deviated from 1.0 (Fig-
ure S3), implying polypharmacology. Because psychedelics
have relatively high affinities for 5-HT2A receptors, it is
likely that the effects of psychedelics are mediated primarily
through 5-HT2A receptors at low concentrations and modu-
lated by other targets at high concentrations. Interestingly,

DISCUSSION
Classical serotonergic psychedelics are known to cause
changes in mood (Griffiths et al., 2006, 2008, 2011) and brain
function (Carhart-Harris et al., 2017) that persist long after the
acute effects of the drugs have subsided. Moreover, several
psychedelics elevate glutamate levels in the cortex (Nichols,
2004, 2016) and increase gene expression in vivo of the neuro-
trophin BDNF as well as immediate-early genes associated with
plasticity (Martin et al., 2014; Nichols and Sanders-Bush, 2002;
Vaidya et al., 1997). This indirect evidence has led to the
reasonable hypothesis that psychedelics promote structural
and functional neural plasticity, although this assumption had
never been rigorously tested (Bogenschutz and Pommy,
2012; Vollenweider and Kometer, 2010). The data presented
here provide direct evidence for this hypothesis, demonstrating
that psychedelics cause both structural and functional changes
in cortical neurons.

Prior to this study, two reports sug-
gested that psychedelics might be able
to produce changes in neuronal structure.
Jones et al. (2009) demonstrated that DOI
was capable of transiently increasing the
size of dendritic spines on cortical neu-
rons, but no change in spine density was
observed. The second study showed
that DOI promoted neurite extension in a
cell line of neuronal lineage (Marinova
et al., 2017). Both of these reports utilized
DOI, a psychedelic of the amphetamine
class. Here we demonstrate that the abil-
ity to change neuronal structure is not a
unique property of amphetamines like
DOI because psychedelics from the ergo-
line, tryptamine, and iboga classes of compounds also promote
structural plasticity. Additionally, D-amphetamine does not in-
crease the complexity of cortical dendritic arbors in culture,
and therefore, these morphological changes cannot be simply
attributed to an increase in monoamine neurotransmission.
The identification of psychoplastogens belonging to distinct
chemical families is an important aspect of this work because
it suggests that ketamine is not unique in its ability to promote
structural and functional plasticity. In addition to ketamine, the
prototypical psychoplastogen, only a relatively small number of
plasticity-promoting small molecules have been identified previ-
ously. Such compounds include the N-methyl-D-aspartate
(NMDA) receptor ligand GLYX-13 (i.e., rapastinel), the mGlu2/3
antagonist LY341495, the TrkB agonist 7,8-DHF, and the musca-
rinic receptor antagonist scopolamine (Lepack et al., 2016; Cas-
tello et al., 2014; Zeng et al., 2012; Voleti et al., 2013). We
observe that hallucinogens from four distinct structural classes
(i.e., tryptamine, amphetamine, ergoline, and iboga) are also
potent psychoplastogens, providing additional lead scaffolds
for medicinal chemistry efforts aimed at identifying neurothera-
peutics. Furthermore, our cellular assays revealed that several
of these compounds were more efficacious (e.g., MDMA) or
3176
Cell Reports 23, 3170–3182, June 12, 2018
 more potent (e.g., LSD) than ketamine. In fact, the plasticity-pro-
moting properties of psychedelics and entactogens rivaled that
of BDNF (Figures 3A–3C and S3). The extreme potency of LSD
in particular might be due to slow off kinetics, as recently pro-
posed following the disclosure of the LSD-bound 5-HT2B crystal
structure (Wacker et al., 2017).
Importantly, the psychoplastogenic effects of psychedelics in
cortical cultures were also observed in vivo using both vertebrate
and invertebrate models, demonstrating that they act through an
evolutionarily conserved mechanism. Furthermore, the concen-
trations of psychedelics utilized in our in vitro cell culture assays
were consistent with those reached in the brain following sys-
temic administration of therapeutic doses in rodents (Yang
et al., 2018; Cohen and Vogel, 1972). This suggests that neurito-
genesis, spinogenesis, and/or synaptogenesis assays per-
formed using cortical cultures might have value for identifying
psychoplastogens and fast-acting antidepressants. It should
be noted that our structural plasticity studies performed in vitro
utilized neurons exposed to psychedelics for extended periods
of time. Because brain exposure to these compounds is often
of short duration due to rapid metabolism, it will be interesting
to assess the kinetics of psychedelic-induced plasticity.
A key question in the field of psychedelic medicine has been
whether or not psychedelics promote changes in the density of
dendritic spines (Kyzar et al., 2017). Using super-resolution
SIM, we clearly demonstrate that psychedelics do, in fact, in-
crease the density of dendritic spines on cortical neurons, an ef-
fect that is not restricted to a particular structural class of com-
pounds. Using DMT, we verified that cortical neuron spine
density increases in vivo and that these changes in structural
plasticity are accompanied by functional effects such as
increased amplitude and frequency of spontaneous EPSCs.

We specifically designed these experi-
ments to mimic previous studies of keta-
mine (Li et al., 2010) so that we might
directly compare these two compounds,
and, to a first approximation, they appear
to be remarkably similar. Not only do they
both increase spine density and neuronal
excitability in the cortex, they seem to
have similar behavioral effects. We have
shown previously that, like ketamine,
DMT promotes fear extinction learning
and has antidepressant effects in the
forced swim test (Cameron et al., 2018). These results, coupled
with the fact that ayahuasca, a DMT-containing concoction, has
potent antidepressant effects in humans (Oso
´ rio et al., 2015;
Sanches et al., 2016; Santos et al., 2007), suggests that classical
psychedelics and ketamine might share a related therapeutic
mechanism.
Although the molecular targets of ketamine and psychedelics
are different (NMDA and 5-HT2A receptors, respectively), they
appeartocausesimilardownstream effectsonstructuralplasticity
byactivatingmTOR.Thisfindingissignificantbecauseketamineis
known to be addictive whereas many classical psychedelics are
not(Nuttetal.,2007,2010).Theexactmechanismsbywhich these
compounds stimulate mTOR is still not entirely understood, but
our data suggest that, at least for classical psychedelics, TrkB
and 5-HT2A receptors are involved. Although most classical psy-
chedelics are not considered to be addictive, there are still signif-
icant safety concerns with their use in medicine because they
cause profound perceptual disturbances and still have the poten-
tial to be abused. Therefore, the identification of non-hallucino-
genic analogs capable of promoting plasticity in the PFC could
facilitate a paradigm shift in our approach to treating neuropsychi-
atric diseases. Moreover, such compounds could be critical to
resolving the long-standing debate in the field concerning whether
the subjective effects of psychedelics are necessary for their ther-
apeutic effects (Maji�
c et al., 2015). Although our group is actively
investigating the psychoplastogenic properties of non-hallucino-
genicanalogsofpsychedelics,othershavereportedthetherapeu-
tic potential of safer structural and functional analogs of ketamine
(Moskal et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2015; Zanos et al., 2016).
Our data demonstrate that classical psychedelics from several
distinct chemical classes are capable of robustly promoting the
growth of both neurites and dendritic spines in vitro, in vivo, and
Cell Reports 23, 3170–3182, June 12, 2018

 across species. Importantly, our studies highlight the similarities
between the effects of ketamine and those of classical seroto-
nergic psychedelics, supporting the hypothesis that the clinical
antidepressant and anxiolytic effects of these molecules might
result from their ability to promote structural and functional plas-
ticity in prefrontal cortical neurons. We have demonstrated that
the plasticity-promoting properties of psychedelics require
TrkB, mTOR, and 5-HT2A signaling, suggesting that these key
signaling hubs may serve as potential targets for the develop-
ment of psychoplastogens, fast-acting antidepressants, and an-
xiolytics. Taken together, our results suggest that psychedelics
may be used as lead structures to identify next-generation neu-
rotherapeutics with improved efficacy and safety profiles.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Drugs
For in vitro studies, all compounds were dissolved
in DMSO and diluted 1:1,000, with the exception
that BDNF was dissolved in water. Cells were
treated with DMT at a final concentration of
90 mM (0.1% DMSO), whereas all other com-
pounds were used at 10 mM (0.1% DMSO) unless
noted otherwise. For in vivo studies, DMT or
ketamine was dissolved in sterile 0.9% saline
and administered intraperitoneally at a dose of
10 mg/kg and an injection volume of 1 mL/kg.
Animals
Sprague-Dawley rats were obtained from Charles
River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA, USA). The
age and sex of the animals used are noted under
each
individual
experimental
subheading.
All
experimental procedures involving animals were
approved by the University of California, Davis
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and adhered to the prin-
ciples described in the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.
The University of California, Davis is accredited by the Association for Assess-
ment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC) and
has an Animal Welfare Assurance number (A3433-01) on file with the Office of
Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW).
Cell Culture
Primary cortical cultures were prepared using tissue from embryonic day 18
(E18) Sprague-Dawley rats. Cells were plated at various densities on poly-D-
lysine-coated plates depending on the specific experiment (Supplemental
Experimental Procedures). Plating medium consisted of 10% heat-inactivated
fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Life Technologies), 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Life
Technologies), and 0.5 mM glutamine (Life Technologies) in Neurobasal (Life
Technologies). After 15–24 hr, the medium was removed and exchanged for
3178
Cell Reports 23, 3170–3182, June 12, 2018
 replacement medium containing 13 B27 supplement (Life Technologies), 1%
penicillin-streptomycin, 0.5 mM glutamine, 12.5 mM glutamate, and Neuro-
basal. After 96 hr, 50% of the medium was removed and replaced with feed
medium containing 13 B27 supplement, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and
0.5 mM glutamine. Once per week, until the cultures had reached sufficient
maturity for experiments, 50% of the culture medium was removed and re-
placed with feed medium, with an additional 20% by volume being added to
account for evaporation. For experiments using antagonists or inhibitors, cells
were pretreated with ANA-12 (10 mM), rapamycin (100 nM), and ketanserin
(100 mM) for 10 min prior to addition of test compounds unless otherwise
noted. The final DMSO concentration of these experiments was 0.2%. The
neurons used in each cellular experiment were taken from at least two different
treatment wells, and the wells were randomized to account for plate effects. All
of the cellular experiments were replicated on at least two occasions by two or
more experimenters.
Statistical Analysis
Appropriate samples sizes were estimated based on our previous experiences
performing similar experiments. Data are represented as mean ± SEM. Statis-
tical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism (version 7.0a). For ana-
lyses involving comparison of three or more groups, a one-way analysis of vari-
ance (Dunnett’s post hoc test) was utilized. No statistics were calculated for
the individual points of the Sholl plots. Instead, statistical analyses were per-
formed on the aggregate data (i.e., the area under the curve of the Sholl
plot). Probability distributions from electrophysiology experiments were
compared using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p <
