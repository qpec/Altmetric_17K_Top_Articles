ABSTRACT
Background: Resistance exercise increases muscle mass and func-
tion in older adults, but responses are attenuated compared with
younger people. Data suggest that long-chain n–3 polyunsaturated
fatty acids (PUFAs) may enhance adaptations to resistance exercise
in older women. To our knowledge, this possibility has not been
investigated in men.
Objective: We sought to determine the effects of long-chain n–3
PUFA supplementation on resistance exercise training–induced in-
creases in muscle mass and function and whether these effects differ
between older men and women.
Design: Fifty men and women [men: n = 27, mean 6 SD age: 70.6 6
4.5 y, mean 6 SD body mass index (BMI; in kg/m2): 25.6 6 4.2;
women: n = 23, mean 6 SD age: 70.7 6 3.3 y, mean 6 SD BMI:
25.3 6 4.7] were randomly assigned to either long-chain n–3 PUFA
(n = 23; 3 g fish oil/d) or placebo (n = 27; 3 g safflower oil/d) and
participated in lower-limb resistance exercise training twice weekly
for 18 wk. Muscle size, strength, and quality (strength per unit muscle
area), functional abilities, and circulating metabolic and inflammatory
markers were measured before and after the intervention.
Results: Maximal isometric torque increased after exercise training
to a greater (P , 0.05) extent in the long-chain n–3 PUFA group than
in the placebo group in women, with no differences (P . 0.05)
between groups in men. In both sexes, the effect of exercise training
on maximal isokinetic torque at 30, 90, and 2408 s21, 4-m walk time,
chair-rise time, muscle anatomic cross-sectional area, and muscle fat did
not differ (P . 0.05) between groups. There was a greater (P , 0.05)
increase in muscle quality in women after exercise training in the
long-chain n–3 PUFA group than in the placebo group, with no such
differences in men (P . 0.05). Long-chain n–3 PUFAs resulted in
a greater decrease (P , 0.05) than the placebo in plasma triglycer-
ide concentrations in both sexes, with no differences (P . 0.05) in
glucose, insulin, or inflammatory markers.
Conclusion: Long-chain n–3 PUFA supplementation augments
increases in muscle function and quality in older women but not
in older men after resistance exercise training. This trial was
registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02843009.

INTRODUCTION
Older adults experience a loss of skeletal muscle mass termed
sarcopenia (1). The mechanisms underlying sarcopenia remain to
be fully established (2). Aging results not only in a loss of muscle
mass but also a decrease in muscle strength (dynapenia). Several
studies have shown that in older adults the decline in muscle
strength is w2–4-fold more rapid than the reduction in muscle
mass, indicating a decline in muscle quality (strength generated
per unit of muscle mass) (3, 4). Resistance exercise is bene-
ficial for maintaining and improving muscle mass, strength,
and quality in older adults (5, 6). The magnitude of increase
with exercise is, however, less than that seen in younger
people and may differ between sexes (7, 8). Nutrition is fre-
quently suggested to be a critical factor in determining the

 response to resistance exercise in older adults (9), and re-
cent evidence has emerged to suggest that the fish oil–derived
long-chain n–3 PUFAs, mainly EPA and DHA, may be im-
portant (10).
Indeed, early animal and cell work highlighted the potential of
long-chain n–3 PUFAs (11–14). In humans, long-chain n–3
PUFA supplementation increases muscle mass and function in
sedentary people (15–17). In addition, one study (18) investi-
gated whether long-chain n–3 PUFAs enhance the adaptive re-
sponse to the effects of resistance exercise in older adults.
Increases in peak torque and the rate of torque development after
90 d resistance exercise were greater in older women supplemented
with 2 g long-chain n–3 PUFAs/d. This study, however, included
only women, was not placebo-controlled, and did not include
muscle mass measurements. These drawbacks limit the wider ap-
plicability of these findings. A wealth of evidence has highlighted
the potency of the placebo effect (19). Thus, whether this is a true
or placebo effect and whether such an effect is seen in men both
remain to be established. Indeed, in original epidemiologic work,
demonstrating an association between fatty (rich in EPA/DHA) fish
consumption and grip strength, each additional portion of fatty fish
consumed per week was associated with a 1.8% gain in grip
strength in women and only a 1.0% gain in men (20).
Therefore, we sought to determine the effects of long-chain
n–3 PUFA supplementation on the adaptations in skeletal muscle
mass, function, and systemic inflammation and whether these
effects differed between men and women. Our hypothesis was
that long-chain n–3 PUFA supplementation would enhance the
adaptive responses in muscle mass and function to resistance
exercise training in both men and women but that the effect
would be greater in women than in men.
METHODS
Participants
Fifty-eight men and women were enrolled in the study
(NCT02843009) between 2012 and 2014 (Figure 1). After
being randomly assigned, 8 volunteers withdrew from the
study; 50 participants (27 men and 23 women) completed it.
Participants were recruited via posters and advertisements
published in local newspapers and magazines. Inclusion cri-
teria were being medically stable (i.e., free from cardiac ill-
ness, cancer arthritis, respiratory disease, metabolic disease,
recent fractures, and loss of mobility) (21), not taking daily
analgesia or nutritional supplements, and not participating
in any resistance exercise training. Two participants were
taking medications: 1 woman was prescribed angiotensin-
converting enzyme inhibitors for mild hypertension and 1 man
was prescribed allopurinol for gout. They were asked to
continue taking their medication throughout the study. The
study was approved by the University of Aberdeen College of

consent was obtained after explaining the aims, risks, and
potential discomfort associated with the study, which con-
formed to the Declaration of Helsinki. Data from the control
group of this study was recently published in a separate
manuscript investigating sex differences in response to re-
sistance exercise alone (8).
Study protocol
Upon entering the study, participants were randomly assigned
(1:1 via a random number table) in a double-blind fashion to
consume either 3 capsules long-chain n–3 PUFAs/d (3 3 1 g
capsules giving 2.1 g EPA/d + 0.6 g DHA/d) (Barleans) or 3
identical-looking capsules of placebo (safflower oil: 3.0 g/d)
(Barleans) every day for 18 wk. This dose was chosen on the
basis of pilot data that demonstrated a beneficial effect on ad-
aptations to strength in response to resistance training in older
women (data not shown). At the end of the trial, the adherence
of volunteers was evaluated by leftover pill count. Participants
were asked to maintain their habitual diet and physical activity
and to record any fish consumed in a diary for the duration of
the study. Participants were also asked to refrain from exer-
cise for 48 h before each study visit, and testing was carried out
at the same time of the day. Physical activity levels were mea-
sured with use of an international physical activity questionnaire
when the study commenced. At baseline and 18 wk, body mass,
resting heart rate (HR)14, and blood pressure (BP) were measured.
HR and BP were measured after 10 min seated rest with an au-
tomated sphygmomanometer. The mean of 3 measurements was
used.
Resistance exercise training was performed by both groups
twice a week for 18 wk. Each training session included 4 sets of 9
repetitions for each lower-body exercise: leg press, leg extension,
leg curl, and calf press. The load for each exercise was set at 70%
of the participants’ 1 repetition maximum. This was assessed for
each exercise at baseline and every 6 wk, and the load was
readjusted accordingly. All training sessions were supervised by
a qualified instructor and scheduled at a time of day suitable for
the participant.
Measurements
The following measurements were made at baseline and at 18 wk.
Knee-extensor isometric and isokinetic torque
Maximal isometric torque of the knee-extensor muscles of the
right leg was determined during a maximal voluntary contraction
with the participant seated on a Biodex dynamometer with a knee
angle of 738. Participants were secured with the use of seatbelts,
and the settings were recorded and reproduced during successive
visits. Each maximal voluntary contraction was repeated $3
times, and the highest value was used for subsequent analysis.
With the same seating position, maximal isokinetic torque of
the knee extensors was measured at 30, 90, and 2408s21, and
the highest of 5 attempts was recorded. The range of motion
for the isokinetic tests was 120 to 158.
Short-performance physical battery test
The short-performance physical battery (SPPB) test consists of
balance, walking speed, and timed chair-stand tests (22). The
balance tests required participants to maintain a side-by-side,
semi-tandem, and tandem stance for 10 s. All participants were
able to complete the 3 balance tests for the full 10 s, so these data
are not presented. The chair-stand test involved participants rising
from a chair with their arms across their chest 5 times. This was
repeated 3 times, and the fastest time was recorded for analysis.
Participants were then instructed to complete 3 separate 4-m
walks at the fastest pace possible, with the fastest time recorded
for analysis.
MRI
Of the 50 participants who completed the intervention, 45
participants [n = 22 (10 women) in the placebo and n = 23 (10
women) in the long-chain n–3 PUFA group] were able to par-
ticipate in MRI data collection. The other 5 participants were
unable to undergo scans because 3 suffered from claustrophobia
and 2 had metal implants. All scans were carried out on a Philips
Achieva 3.0T whole-body MRI scanner with the use of a 16-
channel sensitivity-encoding (SENSE XL Torso) coil, and
muscle anatomic cross-sectional area (ACSA) was calculated as
described previously (8). Muscle quality was calculated as tor-
que (knee-extensor isometric strength) per unit ACSA.
Blood sampling
Fasted blood samples were collected from a vein in the
antecubital fossa into vacutainers containing K+ EDTA, placed
on ice, and processed within 30 min. Samples were centrifuged
for 10 min at 48C at 800 3 g, and the erythrocytes and plasma
were separated and stored at 2808C until analysis. Plasma
glucose and triglycerides (TGs) were measured in duplicate with
the use of a commercially available spectrophotometric assay
following the manufacturer’s instructions (Randox). Insulin
(Mercodia) and IL-6 and TNF-a (R&D Systems) were measured
in duplicate with the use of commercially available ELISA as-
says according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Fatty acid composition
Total lipids were extracted from erythrocytes and muscle
tissue with chloroform:methanol (2:1 vol:vol) in the presence of
0.01% butylated hydroxytoluene to prevent fatty acid oxidation.
Membrane phospholipids from the muscle tissue were separated
by thin-layer chromatography with the use of a mixture of
hexane:diethyl ether:acetic acid (90:30:1 vol:vol:vol). Fatty acid
methyl esters were then prepared by incubation with 14% boron
trifluoride in methanol at 808C for 60 min and analyzed by gas
chromatography as previously described (23).
Muscle protein synthesis and p70s6k study
Twenty-seven participants (7 women) consented to take part in
this voluntary substudy (i.e., several participants did not consent
to undergo the muscle biopsy procedure). Because of the small
numbers of participants in this substudy, no analysis of

 potential sex differences in response was done. To determine
whether free-living muscle protein synthesis (MPS) differed
between the placebo and long-chain n–3 PUFA groups, MPS was
measured over a 4-d period (including 2 exercise sessions). To
determine whether the acute resistance exercise induction of
p70s6k activity differed between placebo and long-chain n–3
PUFA groups, p70s6k activity was measured before and 2 h
after a training session in the last week of the intervention. The
last week of training was chosen because the incorporation of
long-chain n–3 PUFAs would be maximized at this point and to
remove any of the contribution from the acute muscle-damage
responses when beginning exercise training (24).
After collecting basal blood samples, participants were asked
to consume a 200-mL (four 50-mL drinks) oral bolus of 70
atomic% deuterated water (D2O) (Goss Scientific) to label the
body water pool. Resistance exercise sessions took place on
days 2 and 4 after the bolus. Two 20-mL top-up doses of D2O
were administered on days 3 and 4. Midstream urine samples
were collected by the participant into a plastic container before
the initial D2O bolus and daily thereafter and stored at 2208C
for subsequent determination of body water enrichment. On
day 4 after the administration of the D2O bolus and after an
overnight fast, a resting muscle sample (w70 mg) was col-
lected after local anesthesia with the use of the microbiopsy
technique (Bard Magnum; Bard Biopsy) from the vastus lat-
eralis muscle of the right leg. Participants then performed
a resistance exercise session as normal, and an additional
muscle sample was collected 2 h after the cessation of exercise.
Muscle tissue was rapidly cleaned from fat and connective tis-
sue, washed in saline, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at
2808C until further analysis.
The resting sample was used for the analysis of muscle fatty
acid composition as described previously. The resting and 2-h
postexercise samples were used for the analysis of p70s6k ac-
tivity as previously described but with minor modifications (25),
and the initial fasting blood sample, urine samples, and 2-h
postexercise muscle sample were used for the MPS analysis
(Supplemental Methods). These procedures for using D2O to
measure MPS were developed in our previous work, and the
single biopsy approach for quantifying MPS has previously been
validated (26, 27). This measure of free-living MPS is an
integration of basal MPS and the MPS response to the anabolic
stimuli such as feeding and exercise.
Statistical analysis
The primary outcome on which the required sample size was
calculated to detect a difference at 18 wk in this study was knee-
extensor maximal isometric torque. Based on a physiologically
relevant difference of 34 N$m, which results in improved functional
mobility (28), and a variability of w11% between individuals, 12
men and 12 women in each group would provide 80% statistical
power at a = 0.05. Statistical analysis was performed with the use
of SPSS version 22 (IBM) and Stata/MP version 14 (StataCorp
LP). Data are presented as means 6 SDs. All data were tested for
normality and skewness before selecting the appropriate test.
Univariable analyses with Student’s t test for normally distributed
variables and the Mann-Whitney U test for skewed variables were
used to assess differences, within each sex, in baseline character-
istics between the long-chain n–3 PUFA and placebo groups. A
2-factor ANOVA was performed with baseline as a covariate to
determine whether the change in variables over the 18 wk differed
by sex or by group and whether a sex-by-group interaction was
observed. When no interaction effect was observed, this was re-
moved from the model. MPS was compared between long-chain
n–3 PUFA and placebo groups via an independent t test, and sex
differences were not tested because of the low number of partici-
pants. P , 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

 went on holiday for 5 6 5.9 d, including 3.5 6 1.7 training
sessions; the number of holidays was not different between the 2
groups, and the duration of training was extended accordingly to
make up the missed sessions. The ANOVA found no sex, group,
or interaction effects (P . 0.05) for body mass, BMI (in kg/m2),
resting HR, or systolic or diastolic BP.
Knee-extensor isometric and isokinetic strength and SPPB
Data for maximal isometric torque, maximal isokinetic torque
(at 30, 90, and 2408s21), 4-m walk time, and chair-rise time are
presented in Table 3. All participants were able to complete the
3 balance tests for the full 10 s, so these data are not presented.
No group, sex, or interaction effects were seen for maximal
isokinetic torque, 4-m walk time, or chair-rise time (P . 0.05).
For maximal isometric torque, although no group or sex effects
were observed (P . 0.05), a sex-by-group interaction was ob-
served (P , 0.05). In men, the increase in maximal isometric
torque after the 18-wk intervention was similar (P . 0.05)
between groups: 41.8% 6 26.6% in the placebo group and
33.8% 6 30.7% in the long-chain n–3 PUFA group. However, in
women, the increase after the 18-wk intervention in maxi-
mal isometric torque was greater (P , 0.05) in the long-chain
n–3 PUFA group (34.3% 6 17.8%) than the placebo group
(15.8% 6 10.6%).
Muscle ACSA, fat, and quality
Data for muscle ACSA, fat, and quality are presented in
Table 4. No group, sex, or interaction effects were seen for
muscle ACSA or fat (P . 0.05). An analysis of muscle
quality data found no group or sex effects (P . 0.05), but an
interaction effect (P , 0.05) was observed. The 18-wk in-
tervention resulted in a similar increase in muscle quality in
the placebo (36.6% 6 24.6%) and long-chain n–3 PUFA
(31.0% 6 29.3%) groups in men. In women, the 18-wk in-
tervention resulted in a greater increase in the long-chain n–3
PUFA group (27.0% 6 17.1%) than in the placebo group
(8.8% 6 17.6%).
Blood and muscle analysis
Data from the blood variables are presented in Table 5. No
group, sex, or interaction effects were observed (P . 0.05)
for glucose, insulin, TNF-a, or IL-6. A group but not sex or
interaction effect (P , 0.05) was observed for plasma TG and
erythrocyte EPA and DHA concentrations. For plasma TG
concentrations, there were 3.9% 6 20.9% and 10.5% 6
30.7% increases in the men and women’s placebo groups,
respectively. However, in the long-chain n–3 PUFA groups,
there were 8.0% 6 20.8% and 17.7% 6 17.8% decreases in
men and women, respectively. Erythrocyte EPA increased by
20.9% 6 71.2% and 89.6% 6 152.9% in the men and
women’s placebo groups, respectively. In the long-chain n–3
PUFA groups, the increase in EPA was 232.1% 6 102.1% in
men and 371.7% 6 227.2% in women. Erythrocyte DHA was
0.5% 6 15.4% and 8.7% 6 17.5% higher in the men and
women’s placebo groups, respectively, after 18 wk. In the
long-chain n–3 PUFA groups, the increase in DHA was 9.8% 6
14.5% in men and 33.8 6 24.0% in women. Data from the
muscle samples are presented in Supplemental Figure 1 and

 DISCUSSION
Our results show, for the first time to our knowledge, that
long-chain n–3 PUFA supplementation enhances the increases
in maximal isometric torque and muscle quality after 18 wk
resistance exercise training in older women but not in older
men in a well-designed, double-blind, randomized placebo-
controlled trial. These observations occur independently of
changes in muscle mass. Rodacki et al. (18) demonstrated that
long-chain n–3 PUFA supplementation (0.4 g EPA/d and 0.3 g
DHA/d) enhanced the increases in maximal torque, the rate
of torque development, and chair-rising performance after
strength training for 90 d. This study was conducted only in
women and was not placebo-controlled. Moreover, muscle
mass was not quantified. Thus, our study is the first to our
knowledge to show robustly that long-chain n–3 PUFA sup-
plementation results in greater resistance exercise training–
induced increases in muscle strength and quality in older
women but no such effect in older men. Previous work (29) has
suggested that the anti-inflammatory properties of long-chain
n–3 PUFAs might ameliorate elevations in IL-6 and TNF-a,
which have been shown to correlate with functional disability
(30), and that these changes may underlie the beneficial effects
of long-chain n–3 PUFAs in muscles. In our study, however, we
did not detect any differences in plasma TNF-a or IL-6 be-
tween the groups postintervention, in agreement with reports
from other studies (15, 16).
Taken together, the results of studies in this area raise some
interesting questions regarding the mechanisms underlying these
improvements. When long-chain n–3 PUFAs are consumed and
the participants (mix of men and women) maintain habitual
activity, mass and function increase to a similar extent (small
increase in muscle quality) (17). However, in our study, when
combined with resistance exercise there is a clear effect on
function with little, if any, effect on mass (w3-fold increase in
muscle quality). This indicates that the mechanisms underlying
the effects of long-chain n–3 PUFAs may be different dependent
on exercise status. When habitual activity is maintained, the
increases in muscle mass and function are likely because of, at
least partly, increases in MPS (15, 16). We observed no effects
of long-chain n–3 PUFAs on MPS. Although there were limi-
tations in these data, such as not having an MPS measurement at
the beginning of study and the small numbers of participants that
precluded stratification by sex, the data are in agreement with
the lack of effect of long-chain n–3 PUFAs on muscle mass. The
main observation in this study was that long-chain n–3 PUFAs
enhanced the increases in muscle quality after resistance exer-
cise training in older women but not in men.
Long-chain n–3 PUFAs may improve muscle quality via re-
ductions in intermuscular fat, which is known to influence
muscle function independently of size (4). In this study, we
found no effect of long-chain n–3 PUFA supplementation on
intermuscular fat in either men or women, in agreement with

 previous research (17, 31). It is worth noting that this study did
not measure intramuscular fat content or indeed the species of
fat. Neuromuscular function, which decreases with age (32–35),
also contributes to the loss of muscle strength and quality in
older adults (36, 37). There is evidence that long-chain n–3
PUFA supplementation can improve neuromuscular function in
young healthy volunteers (38), which may be mediated by DHA,
an essential constituent of membrane phospholipids (39). In-
deed, DHA is involved in numerous neural functions such as
receptor affinity, modulation of signal transduction, and cell
membrane fluidity (40); to our knowledge, however, its effects
have not yet been explored in older adults.
Moreover, single muscle fiber contractile properties, especially
force generation and contractile speed, decrease with age and are
associated with the risk of falling, particularly among women
(41). In fact, in old type II muscle fibers, a decrease in specific
force (i.e., force per unit cross-sectional area) and Ca2+ sensi-
tivity is seen in both type I and type II fibers (42). Whether long-
chain n–3 PUFAs can improve contractile properties of skeletal
muscle fibers independently of changes in mass remains to be
established in older adults. In cardiomyocytes, it has been shown
that long-chain n–3 PUFAs improve contractile function after
b- and a-adrenergic stimulation (43). In addition, in studies of
hamster left ventricular papillary muscles, long-chain n–3
PUFAs, when administered alongside propionyl-L-carnitine and
the coenzyme Q10, increased cardiac function via increases in
shortening velocity and force and power generation without an
increase in fiber size (44). Furthermore, in rat diaphragms, EPA
has been reported to preserve specific force via the attenuation
of calpain activation after endotoxin injection (45). Although
there are currently no data to our knowledge in older adults that
demonstrate such effects, our data suggest that long-chain n–3
PUFAs, although participating in resistance exercise training
may improve contractile function via improvements in neural
function and intrinsic contractile properties of the muscle fibers
independently of changes in size. However, why the effect of
long-chain n–3 PUFAs on any of these suggested mechanisms
would differ between sexes is not clear.
It has been proposed that these sex differences could be at-
tributed to differences in the enrichment of long-chain n–3 PUFAs
into cell membranes. Previous work has shown, at the same dose
of long-chain n–3 PUFAs, a greater EPA and total long-chain n–3
PUFA enrichment in plasma phosphatidylcholine in women after
fish-oil supplementation (8 wk with 0.7 g EPA/DHA or 1.8 g EPA/
DHA) (46). However, in our study, the postsupplementation
concentration of erythrocyte and muscle EPA and DHA was not
different between men and women, although the variability was
large. Another factor that potentially influenced our findings is
a difference in nutritional intake between groups, which may
have affected the adaptations to resistance exercise training.
Apart from the fish diaries, which were not different between
our groups, we did not collect any other data relating to habitual
dietary intake. Sex differences in the response to resistance
exercise itself may potentially explain the sex-specific effects of
this study. As we have recently published (8), although others do
not agree (7), older women do not increase muscle strength to
the same magnitude as older men. It may be possible that long-
chain n–3 PUFAs only have effects in women because there is
a greater capacity for improvement; i.e., their normal response is
suboptimal compared with men. This would make women more
amenable to the effects of long-chain n–3 PUFAs. These
mechanisms proposed are currently speculative, and further
work is clearly needed to investigate them.
Plasma TGs over the 18-wk resistance exercise training in-
tervention decreased to a greater extent in the long-chain n–3
PUFA group, as has been widely reported in the literature (47).
No differences in fasting glucose and insulin were found be-
tween long-chain n–3 PUFA and placebo groups in this study, in
agreement with a meta-analysis in this area (48).
Although our study found benefits of long-chain n–3 PUFAs
on muscle function in older women, this was not reflected in
changes in functional abilities. However, it is important to
emphasize that the latter was not the outcome on which the
study was powered. Although both long-chain n–3 PUFA and
placebo groups improved SPPB scores after the 18-wk in-
tervention, there were no significant differences between
groups in either men or women. This might be because of the
fact that muscle power is more important than strength for
these measures of daily activities (49). Indeed, we did not find
any changes in isokinetic torque. In conclusion, we have
demonstrated for the first time to our knowledge that 3 g long-
chain n–3 PUFAs/d enhances the resistance exercise training–
induced increases in muscle quality and maximal isometric
torque in older women but not older men. The findings of
a benefit in women are of particular importance because women
live longer than men and, because of their lower starting
strength, cross the disability threshold earlier (50). Muscle
ACSA, acute measures of MPS and p70s6k activity, inter-
muscular fat, and functional abilities were not altered by long-
chain n–3 PUFA supplementation, although the study was not
powered sufficiently to determine sex differences in the re-
sponses of all of these variables. Further work is warranted to
investigate these differences.
