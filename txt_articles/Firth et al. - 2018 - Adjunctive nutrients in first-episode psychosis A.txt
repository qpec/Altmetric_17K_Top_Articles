Aim: The effects of nutrient-based treatments, including adjunctive vitamin or antioxidant sup-
plementation, have been explored extensively in long-term schizophrenia. However, no system-
atic evaluation of trials in “first-episode psychosis” (FEP) has been conducted, despite the
potential benefits of using these treatments during the early stages of illness. Therefore, we
aimed to review all studies examining efficacy, tolerability and the biological mechanisms of
action, of nutrient supplementation in FEP.
Methods: A systematic review of electronic databases was conducted from inception to July
2017. All information on feasibility, clinical outcomes and mechanistic findings from nutrient
supplementation clinical trials was extracted and systematically synthesized.
Results: Eleven studies with a total of 451 patients with FEP (from 8 independent randomized
controlled trials) were eligible for inclusion. Six studies examined omega-3 fatty acids, with
inconsistent effects on psychiatric symptoms. However, mechanistic studies found significant
improvements in hippocampal neuronal health and brain glutathione. Antioxidants “n-acetyl
cysteine” (n = 1) and vitamin C (n = 2) also improved oxidative status in FEP, which was associ-
ated with reduced psychiatric symptoms. No benefits were found for vitamin E (n = 1). Finally,
one study trialling the amino acid taurine, showed significant improvements in positive symp-
toms and psychosocial functioning.
Conclusion: There is preliminary evidence that taurine improves outcomes in FEP, whereas
effects of omega-3 and antioxidant vitamins/amino-acids are inconsistent; perhaps mainly
benefitting patients with high levels of oxidative stress. Future studies should evaluate multi-
faceted dietary and supplementation interventions in FEP; targeting-specific nutritional deficits
and the range of aberrant biological processes implicated in the disorder.

INTRODUCTION
First-episode psychosis (FEP) refers to the first 2 to 5 years of a psy-
chotic disorder, such as schizophrenia. The mainstay of treatment is
antipsychotic medications, which reduce “positive symptoms” (eg, hal-
lucinations and delusions) within weeks per month (Malla et al., 2006).
However, 80% of patients relapse within 5 years (Robinson, Woerner,
McMeniman, Mendelowitz, & Bilder, 2004), and only 1 in 6 achieve
full recovery (Jääskeläinen et al., 2012). Furthermore, “negative symp-
toms” (eg, low motivation and social withdrawal) and cognitive deficits
(poor memory and concentration) persist despite antipsychotic treat-
ment, causing much of the long-term disability associated with schizo-
phrenia (Green, Kern, Braff, & Mintz, 2000). Therefore, to facilitate full
recovery, new treatments are needed in the earliest stages of illness
to reduce residual positive symptoms, and treat negative symptoms
and cognitive deficits.
Nutritional deficiencies are recognized as a risk-factor for various
psychiatric disorders (Sarris, Logan, et al., 2015). People with schizo-
phrenia generally have low-quality diets (Dipasquale et al., 2013) and
a spectrum of nutritional deficiencies, even from illness onset (Firth,
Carney, et al., 2017). Furthermore, reduced levels of vitamins and
polyunsaturated fatty-acids (PUFAS) are associated with various
adverse outcomes in FEP; including greater symptom severity,
reduced neural integrity and neurocognitive impairments (Firth, Car-
ney, et al., 2017; Graham et al., 2015; Shivakumar et al., 2015).
Certain food-derived nutrients have been shown to provide effec-
tive adjunctive treatment for patients with long-term schizophrenia. For
instance, a double-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT) in 2008
showed that 2000 mg per day of the amino-acid “n-acetylcysteine”
(NAC) significantly reduced negative symptoms in patients with estab-
lished illness (Berk et al., 2008). This finding was replicated by an inde-
pendent research group in 2013 (Farokhnia et al., 2013). Additionally,
our previous meta-analysis found that adjunctive treatment with high-
dose B-vitamins significantly reduced total psychiatric symptoms among
297 long-term patients in 7 different studies (Firth, Stubbs, et al., 2017).
The potential beneficial effects of B-vitamins in schizophrenia has
recently been confirmed by Roffman et al. (2017), who reported reduc-
tions in total and negative symptom scores from adjunctive treatment
with 15 mg daily of “l-methylfolate” (vitamin B9), along with significantly
improved brain structure and connectivity after 12 weeks of treatment.
Although focused on long-term schizophrenia, we previously
found that vitamins had larger effects in patients with shorter illness
duration, and those requiring lower doses of antipsychotic medica-
tions (Firth, Stubbs, et al., 2017); indicating that the benefits of vita-
min supplementation may be more pronounced in early stages of
psychosis. Additionally, inflammation and oxidative stress are highest
in early illness (Flatow, Buckley, & Miller, 2013; Miller, Buckley, Sea-
bolt, Mellor, & Kirkpatrick, 2011), and may drive the neurocognitive
abnormalities which arise during this time (Mondelli et al., 2011).
Thus, FEP may be the ideal timeframe for administering antioxidant/
anti-inflammatory nutrients as adjunctive treatments to counteract
adverse neurobiological processes implicated in schizophrenia; thus
reducing the likelihood of enduring symptoms and cognitive dysfunc-
tion (Chaudhry et al., 2012; Meyer, Schwarz, & Müller, 2011).
Despite the promising indications for various nutrients in FEP, the evi-
dence for using nutrients as an adjunctive treatment for improving out-
comes in this patient group has yet to be systematically evaluated.
Therefore, we aimed to identify all existing RCTs of adjunctive nutrient-
based treatments in FEP, and systematically evaluate the evidence in this
area. Specifically, we aimed to (1) determine the efficacy of nutrient-based
adjunctive treatments for improving patient outcomes, (2) explore the
underpinning mechanisms of action by examining effects on brain volume
and other biomarkers in FEP and (3) report on tolerability/adverse side-
effects of nutrient treatments.

METHODS
This systematic review and meta-analysis followed the PRISMA state-
ment for transparent and comprehensive reporting of methodology
and results (Moher, Liberati, Tetzlaff, & Altman, 2009).
2.1
| Search and screening process
A systematic search of electronic databases Cochrane Central Register of
Controlled Trials, Health Technology Assessment Database, AMED (Allied
and
Complementary
Medicine),
HMIC,
MEDLINE,
PsycINFO
and
EMBASE was conducted from inception to July 2017. The search strategy
and keyword algorithm is shown in Appendix S1, Supporting Information.
All eligible studies: (1) used samples in which >75% of participants had a
first episode of “psychosis,” classified according to International Classifica-
tion of Diseases (ICD)/Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disor-
ders (DSM) criteria. Studies which did not use the term “first-episode
psychosis” were only eligible where all participants were identified as
being within the first 3 years of treatment for psychotic disorders.
(2) Examined effects of any nutrients including vitamins, minerals, amino-
acids, fatty-acids (or any miscellaneous food-based supplement), whilst
herbal medicines were excluded. (3) Were controlled or open-label human
clinical trials which measured quantitative change in any physical, psycho-
logical or neurobiological outcome following nutrient-based treatment.
2.2
| Data extraction
The following data from each study were extracted by 2 independent
authors (J.F. and S.R.):
1. Study details: sample size and clinical characteristics, trial design,
nutrient and dosage used and length of treatment.
2. Therapeutic target and mechanism: the primary outcome and
hypothesized operative pathway of nutrient supplementation
was determined from the study aims/methods sections.
3. Effects of adjunctive nutrients: quantitative outcomes of nutrient
supplementation on physical, psychological or neurobiological
outcome measures, along with reported comparisons with any
control conditions.
4. Tolerability and adverse events: information on trial retention,
nutrient adherence and any adverse events or side-effects which
occurred during the trials.
FIRTH ET AL.

 5. Study quality: assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration’s “Risk
of Bias tool” (Higgins et al., 2011), to examine 6 aspects of trial
methodology, including; randomization sequence generation, allo-
cation concealment, blinding of participants and researchers,
blinding of outcome assessments, incomplete outcome data and
selective outcome reporting.
The extracted data was then synthesized for each class of nutrient
examined; thus assessing the efficacy and mechanistic findings from stud-
ies examining: (1) omega-3 PUFAs, (2) amino acids, (3) vitamins/mineral
supplementation, as adjunctive treatments in FEP. Safety/tolerability data
across all classes of nutrients were synthesized separately.

RESULTS
3.1
| Overview
Figure 1 details the study selection process. The initial database search
returned 1705 results, reduced to 1255 after removing duplicates. A total
of 1219 articles were excluded via title and abstract screening. Full texts
were retrieved for 36 articles, of which 25 were ineligible. A further article
was identified from an updated search of Google Scholar (Conus et al.,
2017). Therefore, 11 studies, reporting data from 8 RCTs with 451 partici-
pants, were included in this review. All interventions examined the effects
of nutrients in FEP as an adjunctive to usual treatment alone (with pla-
cebo). No studies examined different types of nutrient interventions, or
compared nutrients to other forms of adjunctive therapies. Full details
and findings for each study are presented in Table 1. Risk of bias summa-
ries are presented in Appendix S2.
3.2
| Omega-3 supplementation
Six studies with a total sample of 173 participants (from 3 double-blind
RCTs with unanimously low risk of bias) examined omega-3 PUFAS in
FEP, particularly with regards to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (Berger
et al., 2007; Berger et al., 2008; Emsley et al., 2014; Pawelczyk et al.,
2016; Pawelczyk et al., 2017; Wood et al., 2010). All studies hypothesized
that EPA supplementation would improve symptomatic outcomes due to
the beneficial effects this neuroprotective PUFA has on various brain pro-
cesses which are disrupted in FEP, including neuroinflammation, oxidative
stress, neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity.
Initially, Berger et al. (2007) found that patients receiving first antipsy-
chotic treatment were more likely to achieve symptomatic remission
within 6 weeks when supplemented with 2 g EPA daily, rather than pla-
cebo (P = .036). There were no differences in remission after 12 weeks,
although participants given EPA required 20% lower doses of antipsy-
chotics. Two neuroimaging sub-studies of these participants (n = 15,
n = 24) found changes neuroprotective metabolites in the treatment
groups. These studies showed omega-3 supplementation improved hippo-
campal neuronal health (Wood et al., 2010) and significantly increased
brain markers which reduce oxidative stress and neural damage, such as
glutathione (Berger et al., 2008). Furthermore, both improved hippocam-
pal neuronal health and increased glutathione were correlated with
reduced negative symptoms (P = .041 and .045, respectively).
Pawelczyk et al. (2016) trialled 2.2 mg omega-3 per day (containing
1320 mg EPA plus 880 mg docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]) as an adjunctive
to initial antipsychotic treatment, over a period of 26 weeks in 71 patients
with FEP. This showed that adjunctive treatment with EPA/DHA omega-
3 improved total symptoms, functioning and depression significantly more
than placebo (olive oil). A sub-study of the same sample investigated how
changes in blood markers of oxidative stress moderated omega-3 treat-
ment outcomes (Pawelczyk et al., 2017). This found omega-3 increased
total plasma antioxidant capacity (P < .001) and reduced oxidative marker
“8-isoprostane F2α” (P < .001). Correlation analyses further showed that
improvements in total plasma antioxidant capacity from omega-3 treat-
ment were significantly associated with reductions in total psychiatric
symptoms (clinical global impression-severity [CGI-S]) and measures of
depression. Additionally, reductions in blood levels of 8-isoprostane F2α

 held significant correlations with reductions in depression, negative symp-
toms and functional disability following the intervention.
Finally, Emsley et al. (2014) used a combination of omega-3 (3 g
daily) with alpha-linoleic acid (ALA) to prevent relapse during antipsy-
chotic discontinuation in remitted FEP. This was ineffective; with
equivalent relapse rates in both omega-3 and placebo conditions over
2 years.
3.3
| Adjunctive amino acids
Two studies have examined amino acids, taurine and NAC as adjunc-
tive treatments in FEP: O'Donnell et al. (2016) hypothesized that tau-
rine’s actions as a peptide neurotransmitter, N-nitrosodimethylamine
(NDMA)-receptor
antagonist
and
neuroprotective
agent
would
reduce both psychiatric symptoms and cognitive impairments. The
high-quality RCT found that after 12 weeks, 4 g/d of adjunctive tau-
rine (n = 47) significantly improved total symptoms, psychotic symp-
toms,
depression and
functioning
more than
placebo (n = 39),
however, there were no significant effects on cognition.
Conus et al. (2017) reported results from a double-blind RCT of
NAC in 63 patients, hypothesizing that this antioxidant would reduce
the neuroinflammation and oxidative stress that may impair function-
ing of parvalbumin interneurons in FEP. Although 2700 mg/d of NAC
supplementation significantly increased brain levels of the antioxidant
glutathione after 6 months, there was no overall beneficial effect on
symptoms compared to placebo. However, significantly greater
reductions in psychotic symptoms were observed among those with
higher levels of baseline oxidative stress (P = .02). Additionally,
despite no effect on global cognition, NAC significantly improved
cognitive processing speed.
3.4
| Antioxidant vitamins
Three studies have used adjunctive vitamins in newly diagnosed,
antipsychotic-naïve FEP patients. All hypothesized beneficial effects
would occur from the antioxidant properties of the vitamins used.
Dakhale et al. (2005) examined Vitamin C’s (500 mg/d for 8 weeks)
effects on lipid peroxidation and symptoms in FEP. Vitamin C sig-
nificantly reduced total symptoms, and reductions were correlated
with higher levels of plasma Vitamin C post-treatment (r = −.38,
P < .05). Vitamin C also reduced malondialdehyde (a serum marker
of lipid peroxidation) significantly more than placebo conditions
(P < .01),
although
this
was
not
correlated
with
symptomatic
improvements.
Ingole et al. (2011) examined if the antioxidant properties of vita-
min C could also ameliorate the metabolic side-effects of antipsy-
chotic treatment. In an open-label trial among patients undergoing
their first antipsychotic treatment, they compared metabolic out-
comes of olanzapine plus 1000 mg/d of vitamin C to olanzapine
alone. However, the study found no effect of vitamin C on metabolic
outcomes, with equivalent weight-gain and lipid dysregulation occur-
ring from olanzapine treatment in both groups. Eranti et al. (1998)
administered vitamin E (3200 IU/d) in an open-label study, in order
to counteract haloperidol-induced oxidative stress and thus reduce
extrapyramidal symptoms. However, vitamin E had no significant
effect on either symptoms or antipsychotic side-effects.
3.5
| Side-effects and adverse events
Across all 3 RCTs of PUFA in FEP (Berger et al., 2007; Emsley et al.,
2014; Pawelczyk et al., 2016), there were no reports of adverse
events attributable to omega-3 treatment. Furthermore, feasibility
data indicated high tolerability, as retention was consistently high and
adherence was >80%. Both of the trials of taurine (O'Donnell et al.,
2016) and NAC (Conus et al., 2017) also reported that there were no
adverse side-effects from either of these amino acids in FEP. Simi-
larly, adjunctive treatment with antioxidant vitamins (C and E) did not
result in any adverse events or side-effects (Dakhale et al., 2005;
Eranti et al., 1998). Thus, across all studies to date, there is no indica-
tion of adjunctive nutrients causing negative side-effects or increas-
ing adverse events in FEP.

DISCUSSION
This review aimed to assess the efficacy, tolerability and biological
mechanisms of action for nutrient-based compounds trialled as
adjunctive treatments for FEP to date. Across the 11 studies (with a
total of 451 participants) that were identified, there are some encour-
aging
findings
for
certain
nutrient-based
adjunctive
treatments
in FEP.
Omega-3 is the most widely studied nutrient in FEP to date.
The benefits of omega-3 supplementation has been studied across a
broad range of neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders (Fotuhi,
Mohassel, & Yaffe, 2009; Sarris et al., 2016). However, the pre-
sumed link between PUFA consumption and brain health has yet to
be fully confirmed (Bos, van Montfort, Oranje, Durston, & Smeets,
2016). Our review of 6 studies (from 3 independent RCTs) found
that the evidence for using omega-3 in the treatment of FEP is
equivocal; as is the case in both long-term schizophrenia, and in
those at ultra-high risk of developing psychosis (Amminger, Harris,
McGorry, & Henry, 2013; Amminger, Schäfer, Schlögelhofer, Klier, &
McGorry, 2015; Fusar-Poli & Berger, 2012; McGorry et al., 2017).
Although 2 trials found no benefits for people with FEP (Berger
et al., 2007; Emsley et al., 2014), one study using an extended
course of supplementation (24 weeks, compared to 12 weeks in
Berger et al., 2007) observed significant improvements in both
symptoms and real-world functioning (Pawelczyk et al., 2016). Addi-
tionally, the 3 mechanistic sub-studies from these trials consistently
found significant reductions in central markers of neuronal oxidative
damage (Berger et al., 2008; Wood et al., 2010) and peripheral
markers of lipid peroxidation/oxidative stress (Pawelczyk et al.,
2017). Furthermore, there appears to be a relationship between
these brain and biomarker improvements with reduced negative
symptoms (Berger et al., 2008; Pawelczyk et al., 2017; Wood et al.,
2010). Thus, more research is required to assess the longer-term
benefits of omega-3 supplementation in FEP, and to determine if
certain patient subgroups (ie, those most affected by negative

 symptoms and oxidative stress and inflammation) may be more
responsive to such treatments (Rapaport et al., 2016).
Two further trials found that the dietary antioxidants NAC and
vitamin C were also effective for improving markers of central and
peripheral stress in FEP (Conus et al., 2017; Dakhale et al., 2005). How-
ever, larger studies are required to examine how these reductions in
oxidative stress may relate to clinical improvements. This is a promising
avenue for future research, given that RCTs of other anti-inflammatory
(non-nutrient) agents have also demonstrated efficacy as adjunctive
treatments in schizophrenia and FEP (Solmi et al., 2017; Sommer et al.,
2013), specifically for reducing negative symptoms and cognitive defi-
cits, which is a major unmet need in FEP (Meyer et al., 2011).
However, the positive findings of the high-quality and modestly sized
taurine trial (O'Donnell et al., 2016) suggests the benefits of nutrient sup-
plementation in FEP may potentially extend beyond antioxidant/anti-
inflammatory effects. Taurine is posited to act through other mechanisms
to improve brain health in FEP, such as via NDMA receptor inhibition and
stem cell activation (O'Donnell et al., 2016). In consideration of this, symp-
tomatic improvements from taurine supplementation were observed for
positive, rather than negative symptoms, which are often linked to inflam-
mation/oxidative stress. Along with attempting to replicate the effects
observed from taurine, future research should also investigate the poten-
tial benefits of other neuroprotective nutrients in FEP. Cross-sectional
research indicates that folate and vitamin D are worthy candidates for
adjunctive treatment trials, given that people with FEP have particularly
low circulating levels for both of these in comparison to age- and gender-
matched controls (Firth, Carney, et al., 2017), even when controlling for
other factors such as dietary nutrition intake (Kale et al., 2010). Further-
more, lower levels of both folate and vitamin D among patients with FEP
have been linked to more severe negative symptoms (Song et al., 2014;
Yee, See, Abdul Rashid, Neelamekam, & Lee, 2016), indicating that resolv-
ing these deficiencies may improve clinical outcomes. Indeed, folate sup-
plementation in long-term schizophrenia has recently been found to
reduce negative symptoms while improving brain structure and connectiv-
ity (Roffman et al., 2017). Although experimental studies of vitamin D are
currently lacking, the plausible role that prenatal and perinatal deficiency
has in the aetiology of psychotic disorders (McGrath et al., 2004;
McGrath, Eyles, Mowry, Yolken, & Buka, 2003), along with known seroto-
nergic actions of vitamin D, present a strong case for supplementation tri-
als in schizophrenia (Patrick & Ames, 2015). An ongoing RCT will soon
shed new insights into the benefits of this potentially neurosteroidal com-
pound in the treatment of FEP (ISRCTN: 12424842).
One limitation of our findings is that, despite the numerous
small-scale studies, there are currently no large-scale, multisite RCTs
of any individual nutrients in FEP to date. Furthermore, there was
insufficient homogeneity across study interventions/outcomes to
pool existing data using meta-analytic techniques. Thus, the encour-
aging findings from single positive studies must be shown to be repli-
cable before these nutrients can be recommended for clinical use as
adjunctive treatments in FEP. However, a further limitation of the lit-
erature is that all studies to date have focused on single-nutrient
treatments. Future studies may benefit from moving beyond single-
nutrient trials, since research in other populations suggests that com-
bining beneficial nutrients within multi-nutrient formulas may result
in greater benefits than single-nutrient supplementation, and is less
likely to cause nutritional imbalances (Kaplan, Rucklidge, Romijn, &
Dolph, 2015; Oulhaj, Jernerén, Refsum, Smith, & de Jager, 2016;
Rucklidge, Johnstone, & Kaplan, 2013). There is increasing interest in
using multi-nutrients to target mechanistic pathways implicated in
neuropsychiatric conditions (Dean et al., 2015; Oulhaj et al., 2016;
Sarris, Stough, et al., 2015; Sarris, Logan, et al., 2015). Although this
approach has yet to be trialled in schizophrenia, a combined nutrient
formula which simultaneously reduces damaging oxidative processes,
while restoring deficiencies (if apparent) in folate and vitamin D could
provide effective adjunctive treatment for psychotic disorders; partic-
ularly during FEP, as oxidative stress is greatest at this point (Flatow
et al., 2013). Furthermore, younger patients may be more responsive
to nutrient treatments (Firth, Stubbs, et al., 2017).
Across all of our included studies, there was no indication of any
harmful side-effects, harmful interactions with antipsychotic medica-
tions or increased adverse events from the nutrients trialled in FEP.
This suggests that continued research into the benefits of nutrient-
based adjunctive treatments for FEP is worthwhile and ethical.
However, beyond nutrient supplementation, it is important to also
consider the dietary nutrition intake of people with FEP. To date, the
bulk of the research on dietary factors in schizophrenia has focused
on reducing over-consumption of obesogenic foods, and preventing
the associated weight gain (Teasdale, Ward, Rosenbaum, Samaras, &
Stubbs, 2016). Future studies are required to examine how inadequate
nutrient intake influences outcomes of FEP, as this could feasibly con-
tribute towards poor recovery rates observed in this population
(Teasdale, Ward, Rosenbaum, Watkins, et al., 2016). For instance,
depriving the brain of neuroprotective nutrients may exacerbate psy-
chiatric symptoms (Goff et al., 2004) whereas consuming nutritionally
devoid high-fat foods increases systematic inflammation and oxidative
stress (Devaraj, Wang-Polagruto, Polagruto, Keen, & Jialal, 2008;
Lundman et al., 2007). Further, an RCT in patients with major depres-
sion has recently shown significant reductions in psychiatric symptoms
from corrective dietary intervention (Jacka et al., 2017). Clearly, addi-
tional supplementation trials and dietary interventions are warranted
to establish how nutrition-based treatments can attenuate the cardio-
metabolic dysfunction and poor psychosocial recovery associated with
antipsychotic treatment; in order to improve physical, psychiatric and
neurobiological outcomes from earliest stages of this illness.
