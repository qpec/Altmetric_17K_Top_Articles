The World Health Organization (WHO) defines normal gly-
cemia as fasting glucose less than 6.1 mmol/L and recom-
mends that glucose be <7.8 mmol/L 2 hours after a 75 g oral 
glucose tolerance test (OGTT) test.1 The American Diabetes 
Association (ADA) considers those with a fasting glucose of 
5.6-6.9 mmol/L and blood glucose (BG) > 7.8 -11.0 mmol/L 
after an OGTT at increased risk of diabetes.2 However, as the 
WHO guidelines explain, there is no definitive cut off for 
“normoglycemia.”1
Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices, with 
their 1-5 minute measurement interval, allow BG concentra-
tion dynamics to be captured far more frequently and less 
invasively than traditional BG measures. CGM devices typi-
cally consist of a small pager-like monitoring device that 
receives a signal from a sensor inserted into the subcutane-
ous layer. The sensor creates a signal using the glucose oxi-
dase reaction and produces a current proportional to the 
glucose concentration in the surrounding interstitial fluid. 
The signal is converted into a BG value by using calibration 
BG measurements, which are entered into the monitor by the 
user every ~6-8 hrs.
These devices are primarily designed for use in individuals 
with type 1 and type 2 diabetes to aid BG regulation and are 
well studied in this cohort.3,4 However, because of the 
increased measurement frequency and reduced invasiveness 
they have recently been applied to other cohorts, such as inten-
sive care patients and neonates, with varying success.5-12 
Another, perhaps overlooked, cohort where the more intensive 
metabolic monitoring provided by CGM may be beneficial is 
athletes.
Athletes are traditionally encouraged to consume a diet 
rich in carbohydrates to ensure adequate glycogen stores and 
improve performance.13-15 Physical training is known to

Abstract
Background: Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices, with their 1-5 min measurement interval, allow blood glucose 
(BG) concentration dynamics to be captured more frequently and less invasively than traditional BG measures. One cohort 
CGM could provide insight is athletes. This study investigates what impact their heightened energy expenditure and dietary 
intake may have on their ability to achieve optimal BG.
Methods: Ten subelite athletes (resting HR<60 bpm, training>6 hrs per week) were recruited. Two Ipro2 CGM devices 
(Medtronic Minimed, Northridge, CA) were inserted into the abdomen and remained in place for ~6 days. Time in band 
was calculated as the percentage of CGM BG measurements with in the 4.0-6.0 mmol/L. Fasting glucose was calculated using 
CGM calibration BG measurements and postprandial glucose response was also calculated using the CGM values.
Results: 4/10 athletes studied spent more than 70% of the total monitoring time above 6.0 mmol/L even with the 2-hour period 
after meals is excluded. Fasting BG was also in the ADA defined prediabetes range for 3/10 athletes. Only 1 participant spent 
substantial time below 4.0 mmol/L which was largely due to significantly lower energy intake compared to recommendations.
Conclusions: Contrary to expectations high BG appears to be more of a concern for athletes then low BG even in those 
with the highest energy expenditure and consuming below the recommended carbohydrate intake. This study warrants 
further investigation on the recommended diets and the BG of athletes to better determine the causes and impact of this 
hyperglycemia on overall athlete health.

improve insulin sensitivity, both immediately postexercise 
and through multiple long-term adaptations in glucose trans-
port and metabolism.16 However in contrast, strenuous exer-
cise is known to increase circulating concentrations of 
catecholamines, such as adrenalin and noradrenaline, to near 
pathological levels,17,18 resulting in hyperglycemia and 
hyperinsulinemia post–intense exercise.17,19,20
This study aims to use the CGM BG profiles and dietary 
habits of subelite athletes to investigate if this cohort is 
achieving optimal BG levels during normal free living and 
training. The CGM data provide a unique insight in to the 
day to day BG levels of Athletes that could not be achieved 
without the application of this technology. In particular, it 
asks what impact their increased insulin sensitivity, height-
ened energy expenditure and increased exposure to stress 
hormones have on their BG levels.
Methods
Ten fit, healthy subelite athletes (resting HR <60 bpm) were 
recruited under informed written consent for a study into opti-
mal athlete nutrition (henceforth referred to as athletes). Table 
1 summarizes the cohort demographics. All subjects regularly 
trained > 6 hours per week in a range of endurance based 
sports, predominantly running and cycling. Participants were 
free living during the monitoring period and did not have tai-
lored nutritional programs from this study or an existing 
coach. The research procedures and use of data were approved 
by the University of Canterbury Human Ethics Committee.
Two Ipro2 and 1 Guardian Real-time CGM devices 
(Medtronic Minimed, Northridge, CA, USA) were inserted 
into the abdomen of each athlete ~24 hours prior to the first 
‘fasted exercise test’. The CGM device remained in each sub-
ject for 4-6 days. For all athletes, the Ipro CGM devices were 
both inserted in to the left side of the abdomen and the Guardian 
in the right side. These devices are referred to as sensor 1 
(SG1), the lower left abdomen sensor, sensor 2 (SG2), the 
upper-left abdomen sensor, and the real-time sensor in the right 
abdomen sensor (SGrealtime). Figure 1 shows these locations 
which are typical for these devices. The Guardian real-time 
data were not used in this analysis. Two Ipro2 sensors were 
worn to provide redundancy in case of sensor failure, which is 
not immediately apparent with these retrospective devices.
During the ~6 days of CGM per athlete:
•
•
BG was measured 4 times per day prior to meals, thus 
including morning fasting, and sleeping. These measure-
ments were used to calibrate the device (calibration BG)
•
•
All meals and snacks were recorded (self-reporting) 
and carbohydrate, sugar, fiber, protein and fat intake 
was calculated.
•
•
Any exercise was also recorded (self-reporting) and 
energy expenditure estimated.
•
•
A fasted exercise test was carried out on Day 2, as 
shown in Figure 2.
Calibration BG measurements were taken using capillary 
finger stick measurements and the Abbott Optimum Xceed 
(Abbott Diabetes Care, Alameda, CA) glucometer. The 
Abbott device has reported error of 5-10%.9,21-23 A body 
composition analysis was undertaken by 8 of the 10 partici-
pants prior to the fasting test using a body composition ana-
lyzer (InBody230, InBody Bldg, Seoul, Korea).
Analysis
Sensor glucose (SG) data from measured CGM traces of the 
2 Ipro2 devices were analyzed. These devices have shown to 
have very good accuracy and sensor agreement in active 
individuals.8,24 The 2 signals were averaged at each time step 
for the time period they were worn to provide a single, reli-
able trace of BG. For Ath04, Ath09, and Ath10 only 1 CGM 
trace was available due to sensor failure.
For each athlete, the cumulative distribution of BG data 
was analyzed for the entire 5-6 days of monitoring, and rean-
alyzed with the 2-hour period following any meal or snack 
removed. Time in band was calculated as the percentage of 
SG with in the 4.0-6.0 mmol/L during the 2 different moni-
toring periods. Although a consensus has yet to be reached 
on what normal glucose levels, intensive insulin therapy 
studies show achieving higher time in this band results in 
improved patient outcomes25-27 and it lies below typical 
thresholds for diabetes diagnosis.1,2 Many studies have also 
demonstrated the linearly increasing risks associated with 
hyperglycemia, regardless of diabetes status, with lower lim-
its between 4.0 and 6.0 mmol/L.1,28-33
The average carbohydrate, sugar, and fiber intake (g/day) 
while using CGM were calculated. First, daily caloric intake

was calculated using basal metabolic rate (BMR) as esti-
mated by the body composition analysis. For 2/10 athletes, 
Ath02 and Ath03, body composition analysis results were 
not available. Therefore, BMR was estimated using the stan-
dard equations34 that take in to account height, weight, and 
age. This BMR was then multiplied by an activity factor35 
considering the amount of exercise undertaken by the athlete 
during the monitoring period. This process and relating 
caloric requirements are shown in Table 2.
US dietary guidelines36 recommend 45-65% of total calo-
rie intake be from carbohydrates and the recommended 
amount of added sugars is also related to calorie level in these 
guidelines. Added sugar content of food consumed during the 
monitoring period was calculated using the US Department of 
Agriculture (USDA) database.37 If the added sugar content 
was not available from the database it was assumed to be 
zero, providing an overall conservative estimate.
Fasting blood glucose (FBG) was calculated as the median 
value of the calibration measurements taken prior to break-
fast over the 5-6 days of CGM monitoring. Fasting plasma 
insulin (FPI) was determined by the first plasma insulin 
measurement taken prior to starting the fasted exercise test 
on Day 2 (Figure 2). Fasting insulin secretion (FIS) was cal-
culated from the initial C-peptide measurement taken prior 
to starting the fasted exercise test using the method of Van 
Cauter et al38 assuming steady-state, as subjects were fasted.
Postprandial glucose response (PPGR) was calculated as 
the incremental area under the BG curve after a meal.39 Only 
the area above the starting glucose value was considered. 
PPGR was only considered for meals that had greater than 30 
g of carbohydrate, and where there was no meal of greater 
than 15 g carbohydrate in the 2 hours prior to or after this 
meal. If meals were consumed within 15 minutes then carbo-
hydrate content was combined and the 2-hour area under the 
curve considered from the start of the second meal. 
Postprandial glucose (PPG) was the glucose value recorded 
2 hours after a meal under the same conditions as above.

individual to exercise and carbohydrates. Ath02 and Ath04 
both show very little variation in SG but Ath02 SG is centered 
on a higher glucose value resulting in more time out of the 
4.0-6.0 mmol/L. Other subjects such as Ath03 and Ath09 
show a large variation in SG, once again centered on different 
glucose levels resulting in Ath03 displaying the most hypo-
glycemia and Ath09 displaying the most hyperglycemia. Also 
individual plots for each SG profile can be found in the sup-
plementary material accompanying this article. These plots 
show both SG profiles and the resulting averaged SG.
In Figure 5 it is further evident participants spend a sig-
nificant amount of time outside the normoglycemic 4.0-6.0 
mmol/L range. Once meals are removed, in the bottom plot, 
there is a distinct separation between 4/10 of the subjects 
(Ath05, 07, 08, 09) who have less than 30% time in the 4.0-
6.0 mmol/L. In contrast, the remaining 6/10 participants 
achieve over 85% time in the desired 4.0-6.0 mmol/L range, 
which is clear when comparing the distributions.
All but 4 participants consumed on average an amount of 
carbohydrate that was between 45 and 65% of their recom-
mended daily calorie intake. Ath03, Ath05, and Ath09 did not 
reach the minimum recommended amount of carbohydrate. 
Ath08 consumed more than 65% of their recommended 
intake as carbohydrate. All participants achieved their recom-
mended fiber intake of >25 g. Some participants, such as 
Ath07 and Ath08, have a very low fiber to sugar ratio and 
nearly double the recommended intake of added sugars 
(Figure 6). Ath03 consumed on average ~150 g of carbohy-
drate less than the lower recommended limit, 1770 kcal less 
than required (Table 2) and was the only participant to dem-
onstrate a significant amount time below 4.0 mmol/L.
Table 3 shows Ath05, Ath07 and Ath09 have elevated fast-
ing glucose within the prediabetes range 5.6-6.9 mmol/L sug-
gested by the ADA. However, none of the subjects met the 
prediabetes criteria of PPG > 7.8 mmol/L. Although this crite-
ria is based on the BG 2 hours after a 75 g glucose tolerance test 
rather than after an uncontrolled meal. The mean PPGR ranges 
from 0.2 to 2.0 mmol/L.hr displaying a wide range intra and 
inter of carbohydrate sensitivity. High PPGR did not necessar-
ily correlate with time out side of the 4.0-6.0 mmol/L band.
Discussion
Physical training is known to improve insulin sensitivity, 
both immediately postexercise (up to 2 hrs) and through mul-
tiple adaptations in glucose transport and metabolism.16

Therefore, it could be expected high BG would not be fre-
quently seen in athletes and low BG would be of greater con-
cern due to increased energy expenditure. However, this 
hypothesis does not appear to be the case in the data we have 
collected.
In particular, 4/10 subjects spent more than ~70% of the 
total monitoring period with SG > 6.0 mmol/L even with the 
2-hour period after meals removed. Only 1 athlete experi-
enced a significant time below 4.0 mmol/L and this behavior 
appears largely due to a considerably decreased calorie 
intake compared to recommended guidelines.
Ath09 and Ath05 undertook the most exercise during the 
monitoring period, averaging 102 and 158 min/day respec-
tively. This high training load could have contributed to the 
low time in the 4.0-6.0 mmol/L band, as exercise is known to 
increase BG and induce hyperglycemia and hyperinsu-
linemia as a result of this catecholamine response.17,19,20 Both 
subjects have the lowest FPI and insulin secretion recorded 
suggesting efficient glucose uptake. In addition, both 
achieved VO2max values that put them in the excellent cat-
egory based on their gender and age.
Ath07 and Ath08 carried out the least amount of exercise 
during the monitoring period only averaging 20 and 24 min/
day of exercise, while over consuming added sugars1 and 
Ath08 over consuming on the recommended carbohydrate 
intake. Lowering physical activity is known to impact the 
glycemic control of healthy individuals and the increased 
insulin sensitivity witnessed due to training wanes with 5 
days of detraining.16,40-42 The large amount of time spent out 
of band by Ath07 and Ath08 is likely to be attributed to these 
diet and lifestyle choices. This conclusion is supported by 
Ath07 and Ath08 showing the highest FPI levels and FIS and 
only achieving average or above average category VO2max 
levels based on gender and age.
An individual’s tolerance of carbohydrate is highly vari-
able and is related to a number of factors including age and 
genetics.43,44 A differing ability to tolerate carbohydrates in 
this cohort is demonstrated with the wide range of cohort 
values of mean PPGR and mean PPG, 0.2-2.0 mmol/L.h and 
5.5-7.4 mmol/L respectively. Also PPGR and PPG do not 
necessarily correlate with time in band or FBG. A subject can 
achieve good overall control or even experience low BG, 
such as Ath03, but still demonstrate a high mean PPGR indi-
cating a high sensitivity to carbohydrates. A subject like 
Ath09 also appears to have a very high sensitivity to carbo-
hydrates achieving high PPGR and low time in band while

under consuming on the recommended carbohydrate intake. 
However, a subject like Ath04 displays a very high tolerance 
of carbohydrates, achieving the greatest time in band and 
very low PPGR, while still over consuming added-sugars. It 
is interesting to note that normalizing results by grams of 
carbohydrate consumed did not change the trends seen.
Athletes are traditionally encouraged to consume high 
carbohydrate diets to replenish muscle glycogen stores and 
improve performance, with a particular focus on postexer-
cise carbohydrate consumption.13-15 However, this advice 
may be negatively impacting the blood sugar levels of ath-
letes predisposed to have a low tolerance of carbohydrates. 
In addition it is unlikely that low BG in day to day life is a 
real concern for athletes, unless they are significantly under 
consuming calories. Hence, the potential for a more 
personalized nutrition plan aided by CGM to optimize the 
BG levels during different phases of athletes training is high-
lighted by these results.
This study warrants further investigation on the recom-
mend diets and the BG levels of athletes, in particular those 
in the subelite category studied here. Subelite athletes are 
unlikely to have the same nutritional and dietary support 
from trained professionals as elite athletes. Hence, their 
nutritional intakes are more perhaps likely to be suboptimal, 
as demonstrated in this study.
Limitations
This study is limited by the small cohort size. However, this 
initial pilot investigation has highlighted some interesting

points where there is potential to optimize an athlete’s diet. 
Hence, it has raised questions where further studies are thus 
justified.
A second limitation is that activity was only monitored by 
self-reporting in future studies it would be much better to use 
a specific activity monitoring device to capture energy 
expenditure more accurately. Equally, activity could be 
directly controlled in a more homogenous cohort, in a more 
strictly controlled study than this pilot investigation.
Conclusion
Physical training is known to significantly increase insulin 
sensitivity and improve PPG and PPGR. Therefore, it could 
be expected sustained high BG during free living would not 
be frequently seen in athletes and low BG would be of greater 
concern due to increased energy expenditure. However, this 
hypothesis does not appear to be the case in the data we have 
collected. When the SG profiles of 10 trained, subelite ath-
letes were analyzed over a 6 day monitoring period 4/10 ath-
letes studied spent more than 70% of the total monitoring 
time above 6 mmol/L even with the 2-hour period after meals 
removed. FBG was also in the range of prediabetes for 3/10 
athletes as defined by the ADA. Only 1 participant spent sub-
stantial time below 4 mmol/L and this was largely due to a 
significantly lower overall calorie intake compared to rec-
ommendations. A differing ability to tolerate carbohydrates 
in this cohort is demonstrated with the wide range of cohort 
values of mean PPGR and mean PPG, 0.2-2.0 mmol/L.h and 
5.5-7.4 mmol/L respectively. Therefore, a diet rich in carbo-
hydrates may not be beneficial in some athletes, especially as 
low BG is unlikely to be of concern to an athlete consuming 
adequate calorie intake. This study provides a unique insight 
in to the day to day glucose levels of athletes that could only 
be achieved through the use of CGM devices highlighting 
the need for further investigation on the recommend diets of 
athletes to better determine the causes and impact of the 
hyperglycemia seen on health and performance.
