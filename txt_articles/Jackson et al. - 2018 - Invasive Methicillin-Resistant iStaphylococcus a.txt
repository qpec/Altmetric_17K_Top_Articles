In the United States, age-adjusted opioid overdose death 
rates increased by >200% during 1999–2015, and heroin 
overdose death rates increased nearly 300% during 2011–2015 
(1). During 2011–2013, the rate of heroin use within the past 
year among U.S. residents aged ≥12 years increased 62.5% 
overall and 114.3% among non-Hispanic whites, compared 
with 2002–2004 (2). Increases in human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections related to 
increases in injection drug use have been recently highlighted 
(3,4); likewise, invasive bacterial infections, including endo-
carditis, osteomyelitis, and skin and soft tissue infections, have 
increased in areas where the opioid epidemic is expanding 
(5–7). To assess the effects of the opioid epidemic on invasive 
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections 
during 2005–2016, surveillance data from CDC’s Emerging 
Infections Program (EIP) were analyzed (8). Persons who inject 
drugs were estimated to be 16.3 times more likely to develop 
invasive MRSA infections than others. The proportion of 
invasive MRSA cases that occurred among persons who inject 
drugs increased from 4.1% in 2011 to 9.2% in 2016. Infection 
types were frequently those associated with nonsterile injection 
drug use. Continued increases in nonsterile injection drug use 
are likely to result in increases in invasive MRSA infections, 
underscoring the importance of public health measures to curb 
the opioid epidemic.
Active, population-, and laboratory-based surveillance 
data collected through the Healthcare-Associated Infections/
Community Interface (HAIC) component of CDC’s EIP dur-
ing 2005–2016 were analyzed to assess the effects of the opioid 
epidemic on invasive MRSA infection. A case was defined as 
the isolation of MRSA from a normally sterile site (e.g., blood, 
cerebrospinal fluid, or bone) from a surveillance area resident. 
National invasive MRSA disease prevalence (adjusted for age, 
race, sex, and dialysis) among persons aged ≥13 years who inject 
drugs and among persons aged ≥13 years who do not inject 
drugs were estimated for 2011 from EIP/HAIC data using 
a previously described method (8); invasive MRSA rates per 
100,000 persons in both groups (and the corresponding rate 
ratio) were calculated in conjunction with a published popula-
tion point estimate of the U.S. population aged ≥13 years who 
injected drugs in the previous year for 2011 (9). The six-site 
surveillance area used for the remainder of this report included 
California (three counties); Connecticut (statewide); Georgia 
(eight counties); and Minnesota, New York, and Tennessee 
(one county each). Demographic characteristics and clinical 
diagnoses of invasive MRSA cases among persons who inject 
drugs were compared with those among persons who do not 
inject drugs. The proportion of invasive MRSA cases that 
occurred among persons who injected drugs (among all invasive 
MRSA cases) was calculated overall and by site for each year; 
significance of trends was analyzed using linear regression. 
P values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.
Among invasive MRSA cases occurring in persons who inject 
drugs, demographics and health care–associated risk factors 
for cases ascertained during 2005–2010 were compared with 
those that occurred during 2011–2016 to describe changes 
over time. Health care–associated risk factors include speci-
men collection for culture >3 days after hospital admission; 
dialysis, hospitalization, surgery, or long-term care residency in 
the 12 months preceding culture; and/or presence of a central 
venous catheter ≤2 days before invasive MRSA culture collec-
tion. Cases among persons with none of these risk factors were 
considered community-associated. Trends in the proportion of 
invasive MRSA cases that occurred among persons who inject 
drugs also were assessed in three sites that reported data from 
2005–2014 only (Colorado and Maryland [one county each]; 
Oregon [three counties]).
Among 39,050 invasive MRSA cases reported from six sites 
during 2005–2016, a total of 2,093 (5.4%) occurred in persons 
who injected drugs. The estimated rate of invasive MRSA 
among persons aged ≥13 years who injected drugs in the pre-
vious year was 472.2 per 100,000 in 2011, and the estimated 
rate among persons aged ≥13 who did not inject drugs in the 
previous year was 29.0 per 100,000 (rate ratio [RR] = 16.3; 
95% confidence interval [CI] = 15.7–16.8). Overall, cases of 
invasive MRSA among persons who inject drugs were more 
likely than cases among persons who did not inject drugs to 
occur in persons who were younger (median age = 45 versus 
63 years; p<0.05) and to be community-associated infections 
(odds ratio [OR] = 4.4, 95% CI = 4.0–4.8). Clinical diagno-
ses frequently associated with injection drug use were more 
common among patients with invasive MRSA who injected

drugs than among those who did not (Table), including septic 
embolism, endocarditis, abscess (skin and internal), cellulitis, 
and osteomyelitis.
The proportion of invasive MRSA cases that occurred 
among persons who inject drugs approximately doubled in 
some sites (counties in Connecticut, Georgia, Minnesota, 
and Tennessee) after 2011. In the six-site catchment area, the 
percentage of invasive MRSA cases among persons who inject 
drugs declined from 6.4% in 2005 to 3.5% in 2010 (p<0.05), 
but subsequently increased steadily to 9.2% in 2016 (p<0.05) 
(Figure). Among invasive MRSA cases that occurred among 
persons who inject drugs, cases during 2011–2016 were more 
likely to occur in persons who were white (OR = 1.7; 95% 
CI = 1.4–2.0) and be community-associated (OR = 1.3; 95% 
CI = 1.1–1.6) than were cases during 2005–2010. In two of 
three sites (Colorado and Oregon) that reported data from 
2005–2014 only, similar increases in the proportion of invasive 
MRSA cases that occurred among persons who inject drugs 
after an initial decrease (2005: 11.1% of cases; 2011: 10.6%; 
2014: 15.2%) were observed.
Discussion
In six sites, invasive MRSA infections disproportionately 
affected persons who inject drugs. In this analysis, invasive 
MRSA infections that occurred among persons who inject 
drugs were those frequently associated with nonsterile injec-
tion drug use; demographic shifts in the population of invasive 
MRSA infections among injection drug users mirror those 
observed in the ongoing opioid epidemic, such as the increased 
proportion of cases among whites. A decline and subsequent 
rise in the proportion of invasive MRSA cases among persons 
who inject drugs was observed in the six-site catchment area 
during 2005–2016 and in two additional sites for which data 
were available through 2014; similar patterns were seen in 
the incidence of acute HCV* and in the rate of drug overdose 
deaths involving heroin (1), with notable increases in both 
beginning around 2010.

overestimation of the percentage of MRSA infections in injec-
tion drug users. Second, rates were based on national estimates 
of both invasive MRSA case counts and the population of 
persons who inject drugs that might not be accurate. Third, 
the rates are based on 2011 data because this is the only year 
for which population estimates for the number of persons 
who inject drugs is available. This might be an underestimate 
if current injection drug use practices are higher risk. Fourth, 
site-specific counts of persons who inject drugs were not avail-
able, precluding the calculation of site-specific rates. Finally, 
invasive methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus surveillance 
began in 2016 and could not be included in this report to 
describe the impact of the opioid epidemic on these infections.
Although much attention has focused on the transmis-
sion of blood-borne pathogens such as HIV and hepatitis B 
and C viruses related to injection drug use, infections from 
skin flora such as Staphylococcus aureus are also important 
and might not be prevented solely by programs focused on 
preventing blood-borne pathogen transmission. Increases in 
nonsterile injection drug use are likely to result in increases in 
the occurrence of invasive MRSA infections among persons 
who inject drugs, underscoring the importance of public health 
measures to curb the opioid epidemic. Effective interven-
tions include primary prevention of opioid misuse through 
guideline-concordant opioid prescribing; treatment of opioid 
use disorder with medication-assisted therapies; community-
based comprehensive syringe services programs that provide 
access to sterile equipment used to inject drugs and its safe 
disposal; and education on safer injection practices, wound 
care, and early warning signs of serious infections associated 
with injection drug use.
Summary
What is already known about this topic?
The ongoing opioid epidemic is associated with increases in 
human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C infections and 
infection syndromes such as endocarditis.
What is added by this report?
Persons who inject drugs were an estimated 16.3 times more 
likely to develop invasive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus 
aureus (MRSA) infections than others. Invasive MRSA from 
injecting drugs increased from 4.1% of invasive MRSA cases to 
9.2% (2011–2016).
What are the implications for public health practice?
Increases in nonsterile injection drug use can cause increases in 
MRSA infections, underscoring the importance of public health 
interventions, including prevention of opioid misuse, providing 
medication-assisted treatment, syringe services programs, and 
education on safer injection practices to prevent infections from 
skin flora.
