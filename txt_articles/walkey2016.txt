IMPORTANCE Hospital quality measures that do not account for patient do-not-resuscitate
(DNR) status may penalize hospitals admitting a greater proportion of patients with limits on
life-sustaining treatments.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effect of analytic approaches accounting for DNR status on
risk-adjusted hospital mortality rates and performance rankings.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A retrospective, population-based cohort study was
conducted among adults hospitalized with pneumonia in 303 California hospitals between
January 1 and December 31, 2011. We used hierarchical logistic regression to determine
associations between patient DNR status, hospital-level DNR rates, and mortality measures.
Changes in hospital risk-adjusted mortality rates after accounting for patient DNR status and
interhospital variation in the association between DNR status and mortality were examined.
Data analysis was conducted from January 16 to September 16, 2015.
EXPOSURES Early DNR status (within 24 hours of admission).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES In-hospital mortality, determined using hierarchical
logistic regression.
RESULTS A total of 90 644 pneumonia cases (5.4% of admissions) were identified among the
303 California hospitals evaluated during 2011; mean (SD) age of the patients was 72.5 (13.7)
years, 51.5% were women, and 59.3% were white. Hospital DNR rates varied (median, 15.8%;
25th-75th percentile, 8.9%-22.3%). Without accounting for patient DNR status, higher
hospital-level DNR rates were associated with increased patient mortality (adjusted odds
ratio [OR] for highest-quartile DNR rate vs lowest quartile, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.04-1.32),
corresponding to worse hospital mortality rankings. In contrast, after accounting for patient
DNR status and between-hospital variation in the association between DNR status and
mortality, hospitals with higher DNR rates had lower mortality (adjusted OR for
highest-quartile DNR rate vs lowest quartile, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.70-0.89), with reversal of
associations between hospital mortality rankings and DNR rates. Only 14 of 27 hospitals
(51.9%) characterized as low-performing outliers without accounting for DNR status
remained outliers after DNR adjustment. Hospital DNR rates were not significantly associated
with composite quality measures of processes of care for pneumonia (r = 0.11; P = .052);
however, DNR rates were positively correlated with patient satisfaction scores (r = 0.35;
P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Failure to account for DNR status may confound the
evaluation of hospital quality using mortality outcomes, penalizing hospitals that admit a
greater proportion of patients with limits on life-sustaining treatments. Stakeholders should
seek to improve methods to standardize and report DNR status in hospital discharge records
to allow further assessment of implications of adjusting for DNR in quality measures.

D
o-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders are usually written by
physicians to convey the wishes of patients to not re-
ceive cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the event of
cardiac arrest. Do-not-resuscitate orders result from complex
interactions between patients, physicians, families, and
regional and hospital norms1-3 regarding end-of life care.
Unlike DNR orders written later during hospitalization that
generally signal a lack of response to therapy, early DNR
orders (within 24 hours of hospitalization) largely reflect
patients’baseline burdens of comorbidity and/or prehospital-
ization preferences for end-of-life care.4 As a marker of
baseline severity of illness and patients’wishes to receive
less-aggressive health care interventions, early DNR orders
are among the strongest predictors of in-hospital5 and
posthospitalization6 mortality. Therefore, early DNR status
may result in potent unmeasured confounding effects if
unaccounted for during the evaluation of health care delivery.5
Despite the potential for hospital variation in DNR orders
to influence patients’end-of-life experiences and outcomes,
DNR status is generally unreported by hospitals and unac-
counted for in hospital outcome measures. For example, the
Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) do not adjust
for DNR status in pneumonia Hospital Compare analyses, rea-
soningthatadjustmentforDNRstatusmaybeunnecessaryow-
ing to potential correlation with other comorbidity measures.7
Some8 have argued for exclusion of DNR status from hospital
comparisons because of weaker associations between DNR or-
ders and mortality at hospitals with higher DNR rates, charac-
teristics that may bias conventional regression analyses by as-
signing the same strength of adjustment to DNR status across
all hospitals. However, others suggest that not accounting for
variationinpatients’treatmentpreferencesmayincentivizepro-
vision of care that is not patient centered9 and may confound
evaluation of hospital quality based on mortality rates.10,11
To our knowledge, studies have not yet evaluated asso-
ciations between measures of comorbidity and DNR rates in
hospital comparisons, how alternative analytic approaches12-15
that allow associations between DNR status and mortality to
vary across hospitals might alter hospital quality rankings, or
how nonmortality measures of hospital quality relate to hos-
pital DNR rates. We sought to examine associations between
hospital DNR rates and measures of hospital quality and to de-
termine how analyses that account for associations between
hospital DNR rates, patient DNR status, and mortality may in-
fluence hospital mortality rankings. We hypothesized that ac-
counting for the DNR status of individual patients in evalua-
tion of hospital outcomes would result in changes to hospital
mortalityrankingswithpotentialpolicyimplications.Westud-
ied patients hospitalized with pneumonia, which is a fre-
quent target of hospital quality evaluation.16
Methods
Cohort
A detailed description of the methods is presented in the
eMethods in the Supplement. The study was approved by the
Boston University Medical Center institutional review board
as exempt from review, and all procedures were performed
using deidentified data. Using the Healthcare Cost and Utili-
zation Project California State Inpatient Database (CA SID),17
we analyzed a cohort of adults 40 years or older hospitalized
with pneumonia from January 1 to December 31, 2011. The CA
SID consists of administrative claims data from all nonfederal
hospitalizations in California and, rather uniquely, contains a
validated variable that captures DNR orders written during the
first 24 hours of hospitalization.18,19 We defined pneumonia
hospitalizations using either principal diagnosis claims for
pneumonia or principal diagnosis for acute respiratory fail-
ure or septicemia, with a secondary diagnosis of pneumonia
thatwaspresentonadmission(eTable1intheSupplement).20,21
Patients transferred from another hospital, discharged alive
within 48 hours,16 or admitted to a hospital caring for fewer
than 25 patients with pneumonia in 2011 were excluded.16
Early DNR Measures and Covariates
We characterized both patient-level early DNR status and hos-
pital-level early DNR rates. Hospital DNR rate was defined as
the percentage of patients with pneumonia with an early DNR
orderateachhospital.Risk-adjustedmodelswerecreatedusing
patient demographics, comorbidities,22 and acute organ fail-
ure present on admission (eTable 2 in the Supplement).23,24
Outcomes
The associations between patient DNR status and hospital
DNR rates with patient in-hospital mortality were examined.
Because between-hospital differences in discharge practices
may be associated with in-hospital mortality rates,25 we also
assessed associations of hospital DNR rates with hospital
discharge destinations and length of stay among survivors.
Statistical Analysis
Summary data across quartiles of hospital DNR rates were de-
termined. To examine potential confounding by patient DNR
status, contingency tables and adjusted regression models ex-
amining associations between hospital DNR rates and mortal-
ity were stratified by patient DNR status. We used hierarchi-
cal logistic regression models with hospital-level random
intercepts to examine multivariable-adjusted associations be-
tween hospital DNR rates and patient mortality without
accounting for patient DNR status.
Because accounting for between-hospital variation in as-
sociations between hospital DNR and hospital mortality rates
with a random DNR slope improved model performance
(eTable 3 in the Supplement), all models adjusting for patient
DNR status also included DNR status as a random slope. In-
cluding DNR status as both a fixed effect and a random slope
allowed the association between patient DNR status and mor-
tality to vary for each hospital and was intended to attenuate
bias that might be introduced if patients at some hospitals
elected DNR status at lower levels of illness severity than at
other hospitals.
Hospitals were ranked according to each institution’
s ef-
fect estimate as determined by the random effects.16 Hospi-
tals with a statistically significantly greater risk-standardized
mortality compared with the mean were considered to be low-

performing outliers. Hospital risk-standardized mortality rates
were calculated from the ratio of the hospital risk-adjusted rate
to the mean risk-adjusted rate, multiplied by the mean unad-
justed hospital rate in California.16 We assessed the correla-
tion between risk-standardized hospital early DNR rates and
mortality outcomes quantitatively using Spearman rank cor-
relation coefficients and visually using penalized B-spline
regression.26 Differences in risk-standardized hospital DNR
rates between hospitals ranked in the highest and lowest risk-
standardized mortality quartiles were tested using Wilcoxon-
Mann-Whitney tests. We evaluated the degree of hospital-
level variation in early DNR use unexplained by measured
patient characteristics by calculating intraclass correlation co-
efficients from hospital-level intercept variance estimates27-29
in multivariable-adjusted hierarchical logistic regression
models, with early DNR status as the outcome of interest.
Sensitivity Analyses
A sensitivity analysis with a model that adjusted for hospital
characteristics (hospital ranking models do not routinely ad-
just for hospital characteristics) in addition to patient charac-
teristics was conducted. We performed a second sensitivity
analysis using methods similar to those of CMS Hospital Com-
pare models and included patients aged 65 years or older with
a principal diagnosis of pneumonia, without adjustment for
race, income, or acute organ failure.
The association between hospital risk-standardized DNR
rates and nonmortality measures of hospital quality were
assessed to inform findings regarding changes in hospital
rankings after accounting for DNR status. We linked year
2011 CMS Hospital Compare measures of pneumonia pro-
cesses of care30 and patient satisfaction surveys31 to CA SID
hospital data and created composites of hospital quality
measures by determining the mean percentage of patients
achieving the highest quality rating (eg, measure always
performed). We assessed Spearman correlation between
hospital DNR rates and hospital quality measures.
All statistical analyses were performed between January
16 and December 16, 2015, using SAS version, 9.3 (SAS Insti-
tute Inc). A 2-tailed α level of .05 was considered statistically
significant for all analyses.

among 303 California hospitals. Patients with pneumonia were

Hospital Variation in Early DNR Rates
The median hospital early DNR rate was 15.8% (25th-75th per-
centile, 8.9%-22.3%) (Figure 1 and eFigure 1 in the Supple-
ment). The proportion of between-hospital variation for DNR
orders unexplained by measured clinical covariates was 21%
(95% CI, 19%-25%).
Early DNR Orders and Patient Outcomes
Asexpected,patientswhoreceivedearlyDNRordershadahigher

Similarly, without accounting for patient DNR status, hospitals

andFigure2A).However,afterstratificationbypatientDNRsta-
tus, hospital DNR rates were inversely associated with mortal-

and greater rates of discharge home (59% vs 53%) but shorter
lengths of stay (median [25th-75th percentile], 5 [3-7] vs 6 [4-9]
days) compared with hospitals with the lowest DNR rate.
Early DNR Orders and Hospital Mortality Rankings
In a model that did not account for patient DNR status, 27 hos-
pitals were identified as significant low-performing outliers
(greatest mortality), and hospitals ranked in the highest-
performingquartile(lowestmortality)hadlowermedian(25th-
75th percentile) DNR rates (11.6% [6.8%-19.1%]) than the low-
est-performing quartile (19.1% [12.3%-27.9%]) (P < .001). After
accounting for patient DNR status, 20 hospitals were identi-
fied as significant low-performing outliers and 14 (51.9%) out-
lier hospitals were shared with the DNR-unadjusted analysis.
Differencesinmedian(25th-75thpercentile)hospitalDNRrates
between hospitals ranked in the highest-performing quartile
(17.7% [10.6%-24.0%]) and the lowest-performing quartile
(12.1% [6.2%-21.0%]) (P = .01) were reversed after accounting
for DNR status and between-hospital variation in associa-
tions between hospital DNR and hospital mortality rates.
Changes in hospital mortality rates before and after adjusting
for DNR status are shown in Figure 3; differences in effect es-
timates of model covariates are presented in eTable 2 in the
Supplement.
Sensitivity Analyses
Small hospitals, nonteaching hospitals, and nonprofit hospi-
tals were more likely to have high DNR rates (eTable 4 in the
Supplement); however, adjusting for hospital characteristics
did not substantively change our results. Similarly, an analy-
sis that more closely approximated CMS Hospital Compare
models (n = 34 745) showed findings comparable to those of
ourprimarymodels(eTable5intheSupplement).HospitalDNR
rates were not significantly associated with composite qual-
ity measures of hospital processes of care for pneumonia
(r = 0.11;P = .052)(eFigure2intheSupplement);however,DNR
rateswerepositivelycorrelatedwithpatientsatisfactionscores
(r = 0.35; P < .001) (eFigure 3 in the Supplement).
Discussion
Using a population-based cohort of adult pneumonia hospi-
talizations from California, we found a large variation in early
DNR rates across hospitals. The DNR rates were strongly as-
sociatedwithpatientdemographics(eg,age,race/ethnicity,and
median income) rather than measures of increased comorbid-
ity burden. Without accounting for patient DNR status, higher
hospital DNR rates appeared to be associated with lower sur-
vival, resulting in hospitals with higher DNR rates receiving
worse mortality quality rankings. However, when risk adjust-
ment accounted for patient DNR status, hospitals with higher

DNR rates had better survival. Furthermore, hospitals with
higher DNR rates had better patient satisfaction with similar
quality of pneumonia processes of care. Our findings suggest
that current methods of comparing hospitals, which do not ac-
count for patient DNR status, penalize potentially high-
quality hospitals admitting a larger proportion of patients who
had chosen to forego resuscitation. Therefore, accounting for
DNR status in programs that compare hospital mortality out-
comes may substantially affect publicly reportable hospital
rankings and hospital reimbursements.
Our findings are most comparable with those of Tabak et
al,8 Kelly et al,10 and Escobar et al,11 who examined associa-
tions between hospital variation in DNR orders with hospital
mortality in other conditions. Although all studies found sub-
stantial changes in hospital mortality rankings after adjust-
ing for early DNR status, conclusions differed. Tabak et al8
argued against using DNR status in hospital risk adjustment
owing to potential bias introduced by applying the mean mor-
tality rate associated with DNR status to an entire cohort when
DNR-associated mortality varied between hospitals. Kelly et
al10foundsimilarchangestohospitalmortalityrankingsamong
patients with stroke. Escobar et al11 used standardized DNR or-
ders and detailed physiologic data for patients hospitalized
among 21 institutions in an integrated health care delivery sys-
tem and concluded that adjustment for advance directives was
“desirable” when DNR orders could be standardized. Stan-
dardized DNR reporting in the small hospital sample investi-
gated by Escobar et al did not result in inverse associations be-
tween hospital DNR rates and mortality among DNR patients.
Our methods differed from those of prior studies, focusing on
pneumonia, using models that attenuated potential bias in-
troduced from uniformly adjusting for less-standardized DNR
orders across hospitals, and expanding hospital quality as-
sessments beyond mortality. We advocate for further stud-

ies, including in other cohorts, to explore methods to accu-
rately identify early DNR status from hospital discharge data
and examine methodologies to account for variables, such as
DNR status, that demonstrate variable associations with out-
comes across hospitals.
Wide variation in early DNR orders between hospitals may
be the result of a combination of patient preferences and hos-
pital practices. Patient preferences may vary based on beliefs
regarding end-of-life care; clustering of patients with similar
beliefs may be reflected in a hospital’
s DNR rate. As sug-
gested in prior studies5,32-34 showing greater rates of DNR or-
ders among white patients, we identified that hospitals with
high DNR rates tended to admit more white patients with
higher median incomes but without greater measures of co-
morbidity or acute illness severity. These findings suggest that
socioeconomic and cultural factors result in different thresh-
olds for choosing to forgo resuscitation. Currently, CMS mod-
els evaluating hospital quality do not adjust for race or socio-
economic status. Because hospital DNR rates are strongly
associated with patient socioeconomic characteristics, addi-
tional studies are required to assess the potential ramifica-
tions of including DNR status in hospital ranking models.
Hospital practice norms may also influence when and how
discussions of advance directives are initiated1 and the ex-
tent to which advance directives are carried out.3,35 Physi-
cians and patients may define DNR differently, ranging from
strict comfort measures only to care restricting only cardio-
pulmonary resuscitation.36-38 The inverse association be-
tween hospital DNR rates and acute organ failure supports a
hypothesis that hospitals may vary in thresholds for initiat-
ing advance directive discussions, resulting in a lower level of
acuteseverityofillnessamongpatientswithDNRordersathos-
pitalswithhighDNRrates.Wedemonstratedmethodsthatmay
accountfordifferencesinDNR-associatedcareprocesseswhile
more appropriately adjusting for previously unmeasured
patient characteristics associated with DNR status.
The reversal in direction of the association between hos-
pital DNR rates and patient mortality after accounting for pa-
tientDNRstatusdemonstratestheSimpsonparadox39inahos-
pital quality measure. The Simpson paradox is a type of
confounding that occurs when an association seen in an ag-
gregate sample reverses in stratified analysis; it is generally
caused by 2 factors: (1) a strong imbalance in distribution of
exposures between subgroups and (2) imbalanced outcomes
within the subgroup. In the present study, variation in hospi-
tal DNR rates and differing associations between patient DNR
status and mortality across hospitals likely contributed to the
Simpson paradox. Although simulation studies40,41 have theo-
rized that the Simpson paradox may affect hospital quality
measures, we are unaware of studies demonstrating the Simp-
son paradox occurring in a real-world performance measure.
Others may consider the reversal of direction in the asso-
ciation between hospital mortality and DNR rates after strati-
fying patients by DNR status as a Will Rogers phenomenon.42
This phenomenon may result from the reclassification of pa-
tients by DNR status because more marginal patients with a
lowermortalityrisklikelyhadDNRordersathigh–DNRratehos-
pitals (diluting the DNR pool with patients who were less ill),
but these patients with DNR orders (who have greater-than-
average risk of mortality) were redistributed out of the no-
DNR pool at high–DNR rate hospitals. However, accounting for
DNR status in models including all patients showed findings
similar to the stratified analysis, suggesting that Will Rogers
phenomenon alone does not fully account for our findings.
Our results show that variation in DNR rates may strongly
affect hospital mortality rankings, even when accounting for

between-hospital differences in the association between DNR
status and mortality, and underscore the potential suscepti-
bility of hospital comparison models to unmeasured factors.
Concordance between hospital DNR rates, hospital mortality
rates (after adjusting for patient DNR status), patient satisfac-
tion, and pneumonia processes of care further argue for ad-
justingtoincludepatientDNRstatusinhospitalmortalitymea-
sures. From the perspective of DNR status as a characteristic
representingacompositeofcomorbidity,frailty,functionalsta-
tus, and wishes for less-aggressive care, our findings suggest
that early DNR status is a confounder that should be ac-
countedforinhospitalmortalityrankings(ie,theSimpsonpara-
dox). From the perspective that DNR orders also result from
variable hospital norms and practice patterns that elicit ad-
vance directives, facilities that more actively seek to deter-
mine patient resuscitation wishes may differentially recatego-
rize marginal patients by DNR status and alter mortality
rankings (ie, Will Rogers phenomenon). Thus, before adopt-
ing DNR status into hospital comparison models, future stud-
ies should seek to determine the extent to which hospital-
level DNR rates represent patient-driven phenomena or are
determined by hospital processes norms in how advance
directive discussions are approached.
Several strengths and limitations of our study should be
considered in evaluating the findings. Although we sought to
pattern our analysis after current CMS methods for hospital
comparisons,16 our primary analysis differs in many ways from
CMS models; however, the results did not substantially differ
insensitivityanalysis,morecloselyapproximatingtheCMSap-
proach. It is possible that other unmeasured variables, such
as functional status, disability, or prior hospitalizations, may
also influence associations between DNR status and out-
comes. In addition, early DNR measures in CA SID show good
accuracy, but the potential for misclassification bias cannot be
ruled out. Although use of a random slope method improved
model performance and attenuated bias from variation in DNR
and mortality associations across hospitals, residual bias in fa-
vor of high–DNR rate hospitals may not be eliminated. Thus,
furtherworktostandardizeDNRreportingacrosshospitalsmay
be needed before adopting DNR status into hospital quality
comparison models. We were able to measure hospital (rather
than 30-day) mortality, an outcome that may be affected by
hospital discharge patterns to long-term acute care hospitals
and length of stay.25,43 Because patients admitted to high–
DNR rate hospitals were less likely to be discharged to long-
term care facilities but had shorter lengths of stay, large bias
in the difference between 30-day and hospital mortality re-
sulting from differences in discharge practices is unlikely.11
Because event rates for mortality were not rare, odds ratios
from our models may not approximate risk ratios. Finally, al-
though we anticipate large hospital variation in DNR orders
across the United States, generalization of our results to
regions outside of California requires further study.
Conclusions
We have shown that failure to account for between-hospital
variation in the rates of patients with limitations on life-
sustaining treatments may confound the evaluation of hospi-
tal mortality outcomes. We describe a method for attenuating
potential bias in efforts to measure the performance of hospi-
tals that may be introduced by the Simpson paradox between
hospital DNR rates and DNR-associated mortality. Our find-
ings have potentially serious ramifications for methods used to
assess patient outcomes and hospital quality. Given the prolif-
eration of health care quality measures and the importance of
accounting for confounding by early DNR status in the evalu-
ationofoutcomes,stakeholdersshouldexpediteeffortstostan-
dardize and report patient-level early DNR status in discharge
data and pursue further studies to evaluate the ramifications
of adjusting for DNR status in hospital quality measures.
