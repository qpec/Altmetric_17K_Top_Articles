Summary
Background Primaquine and methylene blue are gametocytocidal compounds that could prevent Plasmodium falciparum 
transmission to mosquitoes. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of primaquine and methylene blue 
in preventing human to mosquito transmission of P falciparum among glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase 
(G6PD)-normal, gametocytaemic male participants.
Methods This was a phase 2, single-blind, randomised controlled trial done at the Clinical Research Centre of the 
Malaria Research and Training Centre (MRTC) of the University of Bamako (Bamako, Mali). We enrolled male 
participants aged 5–50 years with asymptomatic P falciparum malaria. G6PD-normal participants with gametocytes 
detected by blood smear were randomised 1:1:1:1 in block sizes of eight, using a sealed-envelope design, to receive 
either sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and amodiaquine, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and amodiaquine plus a single 
dose of 0·25 mg/kg primaquine, dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, or dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine plus 15 mg/kg 
per day methylene blue for 3 days. Laboratory staff, investigators, and insectary technicians were masked to the 
treatment group and gametocyte density of study participants. The study pharmacist and treating physician were not 
masked. Participants could request unmasking. The primary efficacy endpoint, analysed in all infected patients with 
at least one infectivity measure before and after treatment, was median within-person percentage change in mosquito 
infectivity 2 and 7 days after treatment, assessed by membrane feeding. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, 
number NCT02831023.
Findings Between June 27, 2016, and Nov 1, 2016, 80 participants were enrolled and assigned to the 
sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and amodiaquine (n=20), sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and amodiaquine plus primaquine 
(n=20), dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (n=20), or dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine plus methylene blue (n=20) 
groups. Among participants infectious at baseline (54 [68%] of 80), those in the sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and 
amodiaquine plus primaquine group (n=19) had a median 100% (IQR 100 to 100) within-person reduction in mosquito 
infectivity on day 2, a larger reduction than was noted with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and amodiaquine alone (n=12; 
–10·2%, IQR –143·9 to 56·6; p<0·0001). The dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine plus methylene blue (n=11) group had 
a median 100% (IQR 100 to 100) within-person reduction in mosquito infectivity on day 2, a larger reduction than was 
noted with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine alone (n=12; –6·0%, IQR –126·1 to 86·9; p<0·0001). Haemoglobin 
changes were similar between gametocytocidal arms and their respective controls. After exclusion of blue urine, 
adverse events were similar across all groups (59 [74%] of 80 participants had 162 adverse events overall, 145 [90%] of 
which were mild).
Interpretation Adding a single dose of 0·25 mg/kg primaquine to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and amodiaquine or 
3 days of 15 mg/kg per day methylene blue to dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine was highly efficacious for preventing 
P falciparum transmission. Both primaquine and methylene blue were well tolerated.

Introduction
Since 2000, scale-up of interventions has led to 
substantial gains in malaria control across sub-Saharan 
Africa.1 Despite progress, new tools will be needed to 
control and eliminate malaria.2
Several malaria control and elimination strategies 
target the plasmodium parasite in human beings, 
including case management, seasonal malaria chemo- 
prevention, and mass drug administration. Drug 
combinations used in these strategies do not target the 
gametocyte stage of the parasite, allowing continued 
human to mosquito transmission despite clearance of 
the asexual blood stage infection. WHO recommends 
addition of a single 0·25 mg/kg dose of primaquine

(single low-dose primaquine) to standard artemisinin-
based 
combination 
therapy 
to 
reduce 
onward 
transmission of Plasmodium falciparum in areas of low 
malaria transmission and emerging antimalarial drug 
resistance.3 However, important questions remain.
First, whether addition of single low-dose primaquine 
to non-artemisinin-based combination therapy can 
prevent P falciparum transmission is unclear. The 
antimalarial combination sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine 
and amodi 
aquine has strong treatment and chemo-
prophylactic effects. Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and 
amodiaquine is the standard drug combination for 
seasonal malaria chemoprevention and has been highly 
effective in reducing malaria morbidity and mortality in 
the Sahel and sub-Sahel regions of Africa, where seasonal 
malaria chemoprevention is widely implemented.4 
However, the increased gametocyte production associated 
with sulfadoxine-pyri 
meth 
amine and amodiaquine5 
might influence its ability to affect malaria transmission. 
Thus, adding an effective gameto cytocidal drug could 
greatly increase the community-level effect of seasonal 
malaria chemo 
prevention.
The second question is whether addition of methylene 
blue (also known as methylthioninium chloride) 
to artemisinin-based combination therapy reduces 
post-treatment transmission potential. Methylene blue 
has highly potent gametocytocidal effects6,7 and, if given 
with artemisinin-based combination therapy, might 
provide additional protection against the development 
and spread of artemisinin resistance.8 However, no 
formal infectivity studies have been done using methylene 
blue. An artemisinin-based combination therapy of 
particular interest is dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, 
an 
antimalarial 
regimen 
commonly 
used 
in 
mass drug administration.9–12 In areas of high sulfa- 
doxine-pyrimethamine resistance, dihydroartemisinin-
piperaquine could be a promising alternative regimen for 
seasonal malaria chemoprevention. Dihydro- 
artemisinin-
piperaquine is advan 
tageous in mass treatment settings 
because of the long chemoprophylactic period offered by 
piperaquine11 and activity against immature P falciparum 
gametocytes, resulting in partial reductions in human to 
mosquito transmission.13,14
Since neither sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and amodia-
quine or dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine target the 
mature stage of P falciparum gametocytes (the parasite 
stage infectious to mosquitoes), the addition of 
gametocytocidal drugs to these regimens might prevent 
transmission shortly after treatment and limit the spread 
of drug-resistant parasites.

Research in context
Evidence before the study
We searched ClinicalTrials.gov and PubMed between 
Sept 18, 2015, and Sept 15, 2017, using the search terms 
“primaquine” OR “methylene blue” AND “malaria” 
AND “falciparum”, OR “primaquine” OR “methylene blue” 
AND “transmission”, OR “primaquine” OR “methylene blue” 
AND “gametocyte”. No language restrictions were used in the 
search. Although numerous studies, including randomised 
controlled trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses, have 
reported on the efficacy and safety of single low-dose 
primaquine as a Plasmodium falciparum gametocytocidal drug, 
only four efficacy studies used membrane feeding assays, the 
gold standard for infectivity assays, to assess the transmission-
blocking effect of primaquine. None of these studies assessed 
the efficacy of primaquine combined with sulfadoxine-
pyrimethamine plus amodiaquine. One study in Colombia 
assessed the efficacy of adding a single dose of 0·75 mg/kg 
primaquine to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine plus amodiaquine 
on P falciparum gametocyte clearance. Using blood smear 
microscopy, authors found lower gametocytaemia on 
days 4 and 8, but no clearance of gametocytes by day 8. Since 
no direct measurements of membrane feeding assays were 
done, it is unclear if the persisting gametocytes would have 
been infectious to mosquitoes. Eight published trials of 
methylene blue were identified. Two studies assessed the effect 
of methylene blue with either artesunate, amodiaquine, or 
artesunate-amodiaquine on gametocytes. Groups receiving 
methylene blue had lower gametocytaemia by at least day 7. 
Neither of these studies assessed transmission using membrane 
feeding assays, nor was methylene blue paired with 
dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, one of the major drugs used in 
community drug interventions, known for its long prophylactic 
period.
Added value of this study
To our knowledge, this is the first study to use the membrane 
feeding assay to directly quantify the effect of primaquine 
(partnered with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine plus amodiaquine) 
and methylene blue (partnered with dihydroartemisinin-
piperaquine) on human to mosquito transmission of 
P falciparum. Our findings show that antimalarial combinations 
of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine plus amodiaquine with 
0·25 mg/kg primaquine and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine 
with a 3-day treatment course of 15 mg/kg methylene blue are 
safe and block human to mosquito transmission by 
day 2 post-treatment.
Implications of all the available evidence
Potent gametocytocidal drugs primaquine and methylene blue 
are two promising transmission-blocking tools that can be used 
for falciparum malaria control and elimination. Future studies 
should focus on assessment of the community-level effect of 
adding gametocytocidal drugs to first-line treatments and 
large-scale, drug-based interventions, including seasonal 
malaria chemoprophylaxis (sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine plus 
amodiaquine) and mass drug administration 
(dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine).

The aim of this study was to establish the safety and 
efficacy of the addition of single low-dose primaquine 
to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and amodiaquine, and 
the addition of methylene blue to dihydroartemisinin-
piperaquine in reducing human to mosquito trans- 
mission among glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase 
(G6PD)-normal male participants in Mali.
Methods
Study design and participants
This was a phase 2, single-blind, randomised controlled 
trial done at the Clinical Research Centre of the Malaria 
Research and Training Centre (MRTC) of the University 
of Bamako (Bamako, Mali).
Study participants were recruited from the town of 
Ouélessébougou, Mali, and its surrounding villages. Malaria 
transmission in this region is hyperendemic and highly 
seasonal with peaks from July to November. A study team, 
comprised of clinicians and lab technicians, met with 
community leaders, village health workers, and heads of 
households from each village to explain the study and 
obtained approval to conduct the study. Before participant 
screening, village health workers used a door-to-door 
approach to inform households of the date and location 
where consenting and screening would take place. 
Participants were enrolled if they were male, aged 5–50 years, 
G6PD-normal by Carestart G6PD rapid diagnostic test 
(Access Bio, Somerset, NJ, USA), had a haemoglobin 
concentration of at least 10 g/dL, had asymptomatic 
P falciparum malaria at enrolment, had at least two 
P falciparum gametocytes per 500 white blood cells on thick 
film microscopy (corresponding to at least 30 gametocytes 
per µL, assuming 8000 white blood cells per µL of blood), 
and had an absence of other non-P falciparum species on 
blood film. Female participants were excluded to mitigate 
the risk of haemolysis through incorrect classification of 
G6PD-deficient female heterozygotes. Participants were also 
excluded if they had a serious or chronic illness (including 
signs of severe malaria), weighed 80 kg or more, reported 
antimalarial use within 7 days of screening, or reported 
allergies to study drugs.
Participants aged at least 18 years provided written 
informed consent before screening and enrolment. 
Parental consent was obtained for participants younger 
than 18 years, and assent was obtained from children 
aged 12–17 years.
Ethical approval was granted by the Ethics Committee 
of the Faculty of Medicine, Pharmacy, and Dentistry of 
the University of Science, Techniques, and Technologies 
of Bamako (Bamako, Mali), the Committee on Human 
Research at the University of California San Francisco 
(UCSF; San Francisco, CA, USA), and the Research 
Ethics Committee of the London School of Hygiene & 
Tropical Medicine (London, UK). For the full study 
protocol see the appendix. The Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention investigator’s (JH) involvement 
was approved by the Office of the Associate Director for 
Science, Center for Global Health (Atlanta, GA, USA) 
and her participation was deemed not to constitute 
engagement with human subjects.
Randomisation and masking
Patients were individually randomised in a 1:1:1:1 ratio, in 
block sizes of eight, to receive either sulfadoxine-
pyrimethamine and amodiaquine, sulfadoxine-pyrimeth-
amine and amodiaquine with single low-dose primaquine, 
dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, or dihydroartemisinin-
piperaquine with methylene blue. A UCSF investigator 
(JMB) randomly generated the treatment assignment 
using Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, 
USA), which was linked to  a pre-specified, unique 
participant ID number. The investigator assembled 
sealed, opaque envelopes with the participant ID number 
on the outside and treatment assignment contained 
within. The site pharmacist in Mali (AM) opened the 
envelopes and provided treatment. The study assignment 
was masked to investigators and staff involved in 
assessing all laboratory outcomes. Insectary technicians 
were masked to the treatment group and gametocyte 
density of study participants. The study pharmacist and 
treating physician were not masked. Participants could 
ask the study physician which treatment they received.
Procedures
Upon enrolment and collection of day 0 samples, 
treatment regimens were administered to participants 
after a fatty snack (biscuits) given to prevent 
gastrointestinal side-effects and vomiting (associated 
with methylene blue in previous trials15). All study drugs 
were administered using weight-based dosing, under 
direct observation of the study pharmacist (AM). 
Participants in the sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and 
amodiaquine group received a single dose of sulfadoxine-
pyrimethamine and 3 days of amodiaquine administered 
by weight to the nearest half tablet (both drugs were 
provided by Guilin Pharmaceutical, Shanghai, China). 
Each sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine tablet contained 500 mg 
sulfadoxine and 25 mg pyrimethamine, and each 
amodiaquine tablet contained 150 mg. Participants in the 
sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine plus primaquine group 
received 
sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, 
as 
described 
previously, combined with 0·25 mg/kg single low-dose 
primaquine (Sanofi Canada, Laval, QC, Canada). Single 
low-dose primaquine was given as described previously.16 
Participants in the dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine group 
received 
standard 
doses 
of 
dihydroartemisinin-
piperaquine (Eurartesim; Sigma-Tau, Pomezia, Italy) 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Participants 
in the dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine plus methylene 
blue group received dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, as 
described previously, combined with 15 mg/kg methylene 
blue once daily for three consecutive days (45 mg/kg 
total). Methylene blue was given as minitablets in 
prepackaged sachets according to the participant’s weight

group. The methylene blue minitablets were developed at 
Düsseldorf University (Düsseldorf, Germany), and 
produced by Pharbil Waltrop (Waltrop, Germany).7 For 
further details on weight-based dosing of drugs see 
appendix.
Participants were asked to return to the clinic for 
follow-up visits on days 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 28, and 42 after 
enrolment and were encouraged to visit the MRTC clinic 
any time they were feeling ill. Access to medical care was 
provided 24 h per day, 7 days a week, and free transport 
was provided.
Mosquito infectivity was measured on days 0 
(pre-treatment), 2, and 7
. Venous blood was collected in 
heparin tubes stored at 37°C and placed in a membrane 
feeding system within 1 min of collection. For the first 
three enrolled participants, about 70 Anopheles gambiae 
mosquitoes were fed on participants’ blood for 15–20 min 
with methods previously described.17 Because of low 
infectivity numbers in these individuals, membrane 
feeding assays were further optimised to include about 
90 mosquitoes and maintained throughout the study. 
Blood-fed mosquitoes were transported to the insectary 
in Bamako, Mali where they were kept until dissection 
on day 7 after feeding. Two independent readers assessed 
the presence of oocysts in 1% mercurochrome. 
Discordant readings were resolved by a third independent 
reader. Haemoglobin was measured before treatment 
(day 0) and at all follow-up visits using HemoCue (AB 
Leo Diagnostics, Helsingborg, Sweden).
Measurements of gametocyte density were taken before 
treatment (day 0), and on days 1, 2, 7, 14, 28, and 42 after 
enrolment. Gametocyte density was measured using blood 
smear microscopy and by real-time reverse transcription-
PCR (qRT-PCR). Blood slides were stained with Giesma 
and independently read by expert research microscopists 
over 500 fields for quantification of gametocytes and 
asexual parasites. For qRT-PCR quantification of female 
(Pfs25) and male (PfMGET, Pf3D7_1469900) gametocyte 
mRNA, 100 µL of blood was collected in EDTA and 
transferred into 500 µL of RNAprotect Cell Reagent 
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Samples were stored at 
MRTC at −80°C until shipment on dry ice at a controlled 
temperature (−80°C to −70°C). Total nucleic acids were 
extracted by MagNAPure LC automated extractor (Total 
Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit-High Performance; Roche 
Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN, USA). qRT-PCR was 
done as previously described using sex-specific trendlines 
of cultured gametocytes.18 Samples were declared gamet- 
ocyte negative if the estimated gametocyte density was less 
than 0·01 gametocytes per µL (ie, one gametocyte per 
100 µL of blood sample).
Outcomes
The primary outcome was the median within-person 
percentage change in mosquito infectivity per group, 
2 and 7 days after treatment, assessed through membrane 
feeding and measured by oocyst prevalence in 
mosquitoes dissected on day 7 after feeding. We originally 
planned to use the difference in mean values, but 
amended the analysis plan to use the median value 
because a few individuals experienced sharp increases in 
infectivity after enrolment. We defined mosquito 
infectivity from the participant to the mosquito as the 
proportion of dissected mosquitos with oocysts, and a 
participant was defined as infectious (yes or no) if at least 
one dissected mosquito had at least one oocyst present.
Secondary outcomes included the prevalence, density, 
circulation time (days), and sex ratios of female and male 
gametocytes. Estimates of gametocyte sex ratio were 
restricted to samples with a total gametocyte density 
greater than 0·2 gametocytes per µL (20 gametocytes per 
100 µL of blood sample).18 A complete list of secondary 
outcomes can be found in the protocol (appendix).
Safety outcomes assessed included the number of 
adverse events and the mean within-person change in 
haemoglobin concentration per group after treatment, 
the proportion of participants who had a greater than 
25% decrease in haemoglobin, and the proportion of 
participants with 8 g/dL or less haemoglobin at any point 
during follow-up. Adverse events were assessed at each 
follow-up visit and monitored passively by medical staff. 
All adverse events were graded by severity (eg, mild, 
grade 1; moderate, grade 2; or severe, grade 3) according 
to the study’s standard operating procedures and based 
on the Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases 
(DMID) toxicity tables. Adverse events were further 
categorised based on whether they were considered 
serious by the treating physician, and categorised by 
their causal relationship to the study drugs (unrelated or 
probably not, possibly, probably, or definitely related). 
Adverse events were considered causal if they were 
categorised as either possibly, probably, or definitely 
related to study drug.
Statistical analysis
Based on preliminary data from a similar infectivity trial,16 
sample size calculations assumed that the proportion of 
individuals that would infect at least one mosquito 
was 0·79, and that on average the proportion of infected 
mosquitoes was 0·25, resulting in a probability of infection 
of 0·79 × 0·25=0·198. Using an SD of 0·24 for the change 
in proportion of infected mosquitoes before and after 
treatment estimated from a previous trial using single low-
dose primaquine,16 we did a sample size calculation to 
detect a 95% reduction in infectivity (from 0·198 to 0·010) 
with 80% power and a one-tailed significance level of 0·05. 
This required 20 individuals per group to compare single 
low-dose primaquine to its comparator group, after 
allowing for 10% loss to follow-up. No preliminary data 
were available on the SD of the change in infectivity before 
and after methylene blue treatment, and calculations 
assumed a similar SD of 0·24. Our sample size was not 
defined to compare the transmission-blocking effects 
between single low-dose primaquine and methylene blue.

For the primary efficacy outcome, we calculated the 
median within-person percentage change in infectivity 
and accompanying IQRs for each group. Positive 
percentages indicated reductions in infectivity. We used a 
one-sided non-parametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test for 
pairwise comparisons of the change in infectivity after 
treatment (control vs treatment group). Our analysis 
of the change in mosquito infectivity included all 
randomised 
participants 
who 
had 
an 
infectivity 
measurement before treatment and at least one infectivity 
measurement after treatment. Additionally, we did an 
analysis of change in infectivity among the subset of 
participants who infected at least one mosquito after 
treatment.

We calculated the mean within-person percentage 
change in haemoglobin for each group at each follow-up 
visit. Negative values for within-person percentage 
change in haemoglobin represented decreases in hae- 
moglobin. We used two-sided t tests to compare 
haemoglobin changes between groups. The number of 
participants who had an adverse event in each group was 
compared using a two-sided Fisher’s exact test. Analyses 
of adverse events and haemoglobin changes after 
treatment were restricted to all randomised participants 
with at least one follow-up visit.
We used qRT-PCR gametocyte densities to calculate the 
area under the curve (AUC).19 We used simple linear 
regression models for modelling the gametocytocidal 
effect of primaquine and methylene blue on log10 trans- 
formed AUC, adjusting for baseline log10 gametocyte 
density. We estimated gametocyte circulation times 
using a deterministic compartmental model fitted to 
qRT-PCR gametocyte densities.20 The correlation between 
mosquito infection rates and gametocyte density was 
assessed using the Spearman correlation coefficient.
All other comparisons between proportions were done 
using two-sided tests, and we used Fisher’s exact test for 
between-group comparisons and McNemar’s test for within-
group comparisons. Wilcoxon’s signed rank tests were used 
for within-group comparisons and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests 
were used for between-group com 
parisons. All analyses 
compared treatment with or without gametocytocidal 
compounds (ie, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and amod- 
iaquine plus primaquine vs sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and 
amodiaquine alone; and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine 
plus methylene blue vs dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine 
alone), unless otherwise stated. Statistical analyses were done 
using Stata version 14.0 and SAS version 9.4.
The trial was overseen by an independent data safety 
monitoring committee, monitored by an external clinical 
trials monitoring group (Agence Africaine de Recherche 
en Santé Humaine; Dakar, Senegal), and registered with 
ClinicalTrials.gov (number NCT02831023).

Results
Between June 27, 2016, and Nov 1, 2016, 1749 male participants 
were screened for eligibility. 80 participants were enrolled 
and randomly assigned to receive either sulfadoxine-
pyrimethamine and amodiaquine plus primaquine (n=20), 
dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine 
plus 
methylene 
blue 
(n=20), and their comparator groups, sulfadoxine-
pyrimethamine and amodiaquine alone (n=20), and 
dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine alone (n=20; figure 1). 
72 (90%) of 80 participants completed follow-up to day 42. 
Baseline characteristics were similar across groups (table 1).
80 membrane feeding assays were done before treatment, 
80 on day 2 after treatment, and 76 on day 7 after treatment. 
20 599 mosquitoes were used, 18 026 (88%) of which 
survived to the day of dissection. Before treatment, 54 
(68%) of 80 individuals infected at least one mosquito 
(appendix; figure 2), and 908 (15%) of 6185 mosquitoes 
became infected (appendix). After treatment, only one (5%) 
participant 
in 
the 
sulfadoxine-pyrime- 
thamine 
and 
amodiaquine plus primaquine group was infectious at day 
2 compared with 12 (60%) patients in the sulfadoxine-
pyrimethamine and amodiaquine group, and no patients 
were infectious at day 7 compared with 11 (58%) of 
19 patients in the sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and 
amodiaquine group (appendix; figure 2). After treatment,

blue was associated with substantial reductions in mosquito 
infectivity at day 2 and day 7 of treatment compared with 
control regimens, in both uninfected and infected before 
treatment populations (table 2; figure 2).
Before treatment, all study participants with blood 
samples available for molecular analysis (n=78) had 
detectable concentrations of both female and male 
gametocytes. Gametocyte sex ratios were female biased at 
enrolment, with no differences in gametocyte prevalence 
or density between study arms (appendix). The prevalence 
and density of both female and male gametocytes declined 
during follow-up in all treatment groups (figure 3). This 
decline was gradual in the sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine 
and amodiaquine group, whereas estimates were generally 
lower in the sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and amodiaquine 
plus primaquine group from day 7 onwards (figure 3; 
appendix). Similarly, the prevalence and density of both 
female and male gametocytes declined more rapidly after 
dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine plus methylene blue 
treatment than with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine 
alone (figure 3; appendix). The AUC of both female and 
male gametocyte density over time was lower in both 
groups that received gametocytocidal drugs than in the 
groups that did not (appendix).
The mean circulation time of female gametocytes was 
longer than that of male gametocytes for all treatment 
arms (appendix). The sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and 
amodiaquine plus primaquine treatment group had 
shorter circulation times for both female and male 
gametocytes than did the sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine 
and amodiaquine alone treatment group, as did the 
dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine plus methylene blue 
treatment group compared with the dihydroartemisinin-
piperaquine 
treatment 
group 
(appendix). 
Male 
gametocyte circulation time was decreased in the 
dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine plus methylene blue 
group compared with the group receiving sulfadoxine-
pyrimethamine and amodiaquine plus primaquine. 
Gametocyte sex ratios generally became more female 
biased towards the end of follow-up (appendix). Groups 
treated with primaquine or methylene blue showed 
distinct patterns of gametocyte clearance in the first 
2 weeks after initiation of treatment. Sex ratio was male 
biased on day 7 after sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and 
amodiaquine plus primaquine treatment (mean female 
to male gametocyte ratio 0·02) and equal numbers of 
male and female gametocytes were detected on day 14 
(mean ratio 1·0; appendix). By contrast, the very 
short circulation time of male gametocytes after 
dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine plus methylene blue 
treatment resulted in a strongly female-biased sex ratio in 
this treatment group on day 7 (mean ratio 17·2) and day 
14 (mean ratio 7·4; appendix).
Correlations were found between qRT-PCR gametocyte 
density and mosquito infectivity rates (appendix). Fairly 
strong correlations were observed in both female and male 
markers before treatment (appendix). By day 2, correlations 
remained strong in groups receiving non-gametocytocidal 
compounds, but had decreased in groups receiving 
primaquine or methylene blue (appendix).

Absolute and within-person percentage change in 
mean haemoglobin concentration did not differ between 
the sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and amodiaquine plus 
primaquine 
and 
sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine 
and 
amodia 
quine alone groups or the dihydroartemisinin-
piperaquine 
plus 
methylene 
blue 
and 
dihydro- 
artemisinin-piperaquine alone groups at any point 
during follow-up (appendix). One participant, a 
9-year-old 
boy 
assigned 
to 
the 
sulfadoxine-
pyrimethamine and amodiaquine group, had a more 
than 25% drop in haemoglobin (from 10 g/dL at baseline 
to 6 g/dL on day 28). This participant had a positive 
blood smear on day 26 after treatment with 
PCR-confirmed recrudescent clinical malaria and was 
treated with artemether-lumefantrine. The participant’s 
haemoglobin returned to 10·7 g/dL on day 42. No other 
patients had a haemoglobin lower than 8 g/dL at any 
timepoint.
Overall, 59 (74%) of 80 participants reported a total of 
162 adverse events during follow-up, with 19 of these 
events being bluish colouration of urine (table 3). The 
number of participants who had an adverse event differed 
between the dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine alone and 
dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine plus methylene blue 
groups (p=0·031), although this effect was mainly due to 
frequent reports of blue urine among participants in the 
methylene blue group. As blue urine is not known to 
adversely affect health, a separate subanalysis excluding 
blue urine was done. After exclusion of blue urine, the 
number of participants that had an adverse event was 
similar across the four groups. Of the 162 adverse events 
that occurred throughout the study period, 145 (90%) were 
mild (grade 1) and 16 (10%) were moderate (grade 2) 
events. One (1%) severe (grade 3) headache was reported 
on day 7 in a participant in the sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine 
and amodiaquine group, although this event was 
considered unlikely to be caused by study drug. Of the 
80 adverse events that were considered related to study 
drug, 78 (98%) were mild and two (3%) were of moderate 
severity (headache and loss of appetite). Of the 78 mild 
adverse events, 19 (24%) were blue urine. An 11-year-old 
participant in the dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine plus 
methylene blue arm halted methylene blue treatment 
after day 1 because of vomiting after drug administration. 
No other adverse events resulted in stopping of the trial.
Discussion
This study shows the pronounced transmission-blocking 
effects of addition of gametocytocidal drugs to standard 
antimalarial treatments. Addition of single low-dose 
primaquine to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and amodia-
quine or methylene blue to dihydroartemisinin-piper-
aquine resulted in almost complete blockage of human 
to mosquito transmission by day 2, and a larger reduction 
in transmission than that offered by sulfadoxine-
pyrimethamine and amodiaquine or dihydroartemisinin-
piperaquine alone. No differences in adverse events 
(excluding blue urine) or haemolysis were observed 
between groups, suggesting primaquine and methylene 
blue are safe in this population.
We examined gametocyte dynamics and infectivity to 
mosquitoes following treatment with sulfadoxine-
pyrimethamine and amodiaquine plus primaquine or 
dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine plus methylene blue, 
two drug regimens that have important roles in malaria 
control and elimination efforts. The importance of our 
direct assessments of infectivity is illustrated by the 
observation that the transmission-blocking effect of 
gametocytocidal drugs precedes gametocyte clearance.21

Additionally, 
our 
findings 
support 
observations 
that infectious gametocytes persist after administration 
of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and amodiaquine5 or 
dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine.16,22 
Therefore, 
early 
identification and treatment of P falciparum infection to 
prevent formation of mature gametocytes is crucial for 
malaria control.
To our knowledge, this study is the first to formally show 
the potent transmission-blocking effect of methylene blue 
in P falciparum gametocyte carriers using mosquito 
infectivity assays, confirming the potency of methylene 
blue as suggested by previous in-vitro23,24 and gametocyte 
clearance6,7 studies. Our study suggests that methylene 
blue is safe and has a strong gametocytocidal effect when 
partnered with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine. However, 
vomiting has been associated with methylene blue,15 and 
development of blue urine could affect compliance. Future 
studies are needed to determine the lowest efficacious 
dose of methylene blue and formulate a more simplified 
treatment schedule that allows its use as a single-dose 
gametocytocide, similar to primaquine.16 However, a 3-day 
dose of methylene blue might be more advantageous in 
the context of artemisinin-based combination therapy 
resistance because of the broad activity of methylene blue 
against non-gametocytes.8
When combined with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and 
amodiaquine,5 single low-dose primaquine had a 
pronounced effect on P falciparum gametocyte carriage 
and infectivity. Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and amodia-
quine alone did not have an effect on reducing human to 
mosquito transmission in the week following treatment. 
Most individuals treated with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine 
and amodiaquine carried gametocytes for at least 
1 month following treatment with no reduction in 
mosquito infection rates achieved by day 7 after 
treatment. Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and amodiaquine 
is recommended by WHO for use in seasonal malaria 
chemoprevention. Although the primary objective of 
seasonal malaria chemoprevention is to reduce malaria 
morbidity and mortality and not to directly reduce 
transmission, adding single low-dose primaquine to 
seasonal malaria chemoprevention might confer indirect 
community benefits for malaria transmission by 
reducing 
post-treatment 
transmission 
potential. 
Transmission reduction by seasonal malaria chemo-
prevention could be further improved by expanding the 
age range to include adolescents because gametocyte 
carriage is high in this population25,26 as observed by the 
age group enrolled in our study.
Countries moving towards malaria elimination could 
consider adding a transmission-blocking drug to first-line 
treatments or community-wide mass drug administration 
to rapidly reduce population-level malaria transmission. 
Modelling studies suggest that, given adequate coverage 
and multiple rounds of mass drug administration, 
addition of gametocytocidal drugs (eg, primaquine and 
methylene blue) to antimalarial combinations with a long 
prophylactic period (eg, dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine) 
might result in larger reductions in transmission than 
with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine treatment alone.27,28 
Formal trials are needed to confirm the best-use scenario 
for 
these 
drug-based 
transmission-blocking 
tools, 
including 
the 
target 
transmission 
intensity 
and 
appropriate integration into other malaria interventions.
Our study revealed that gametocytocidal drugs might 
have different effects on male and female gametocytes. 
The strongly reduced circulation time of male 
gametocytes 
following 
methylene 
blue 
treatment 
supports hypotheses generated from in-vitro assessments 
that methylene blue disproportionally affects male 
gametocytes.24 Although, primaquine results in a rapid 
reduction in both male and female gametocytes, its early 
transmission-blocking effect might reflect an early 
sterilising effect18,21 rather than a more rapid clearance of 
male gametocytes.18
Our study has several limitations. First, the study 
population analysed was not as per intention to treat, as 
one patient was lost to follow-up and seven patients 
withdrew. This factor was unlikely to cause attribution 
bias since the reasons given for withdrawals were 
unrelated to study drug. Second, our study endpoint 
was the proportion of oocyst-positive mosquitoes, based 
on the assumption that even low oocyst densities are 
likely to render mosquitoes infective.18 However, not all 
mosquitoes with oocysts might have gone on to produce 
infective sporozoites or could have done so at a reduced 
rate. Third, the study sample was limited to 
G6PD-normal male participants in Mali with high 
P falciparum gametocyte densities. Therefore, our 
findings might not represent the effect of single 
low-dose primaquine and methylene blue in other 
malaria-infected populations, particularly those with 
lower 
gametocyte 
densities 
who 
have 
lower 
pre-treatment 
and 
post-treatment 
transmission 
potential and G6PD-deficient populations. Although 
studies in Burkina Faso showed that methylene 
blue is unlikely to be responsible for clinically 
relevant haemolysis in individuals with or without 
G6PD-deficiency,29 additional studies are needed on the 
safety of methylene blue among G6PD-deficient 
individuals. For single low-dose primaquine, doses 
from 0·25 mg/kg30 to 0·40 mg/kg have been shown to 
be safe among G6PD-deficient individuals aged 
5–50 years.31
Adding a single dose of 0·25 mg/kg primaquine to 
sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and amodiaquine or 3 days 
of 
15 
mg/kg 
per 
day 
methylene 
blue 
to 
dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine were safe and highly 
efficacious methods for preventing human to host 
P falciparum transmission in G6PD-normal male 
participants. Further work is needed to understand what 
effect these findings could have on malaria control and 
elimination strategies, using mathematical models and 
community trials to assess costs, risks, and benefits of
