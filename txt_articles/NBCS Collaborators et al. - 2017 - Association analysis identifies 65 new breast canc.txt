Breast cancer risk is influenced by rare coding variants in susceptibility genes such as BRCA1 and 
477 
many common, mainly non-coding variants. However, much of the genetic contribution to breast 
478 
cancer risk remains unknown. We report results from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 
479 
breast cancer in 122,977 cases and 105,974 controls of European ancestry and 14,068 cases and 
480 
13,104 controls of East Asian ancestry1. We identified 65 new loci associated with overall breast 
481 
cancer at p<5x10-8. The majority of credible risk SNPs in the new loci fall in distal regulatory 
482 
elements, and by integrating in-silico data to predict target genes in breast cells at each locus, we 
483 
demonstrate a strong overlap between candidate target genes and somatic driver genes in breast 
484 
tumours. We also find that heritability of breast cancer due to all SNPs in regulatory features was 
485 
2-5-fold enriched relative to the genome-wide average, with strong enrichment for particular 
486 
transcription factor binding sites. These results provide further insight into genetic susceptibility to 
487 
breast cancer and will improve the utility of genetic risk scores for individualized screening and 
488 
prevention.

We genotyped 61,282 female breast cancer cases and 45,494 female controls of European ancestry 
492 
with the OncoArray1. Subjects came from 68 studies collaborating in the Breast Cancer Association 
493 
Consortium (BCAC) and Discovery, Biology and Risk of Inherited Variants in Breast Cancer 
494 
Consortium (DRIVE) (Supplementary Table 1). Using the 1000 Genomes Project (Phase 3) reference 
495 
panel, we imputed genotypes for ~21M variants. After filtering on minor allele frequency 
496 
(MAF)>0.5% and imputation quality score>0.3 (see Online Methods), we assessed the association 
497 
between breast cancer risk and 11.8M SNPs adjusting for country and ancestry-informative principal 
498 
components. We combined these results with results from the iCOGS project (46,785 cases and 
499 
42,892 controls)2 and 11 other breast cancer GWAS (14,910 cases, 17,588 controls), using a fixed-
500 
effect meta-analysis.  
501 
 
502 
Of 102 loci previously associated with breast cancer in Europeans, 49 showed evidence for 
503 
association with overall breast cancer in the OncoArray dataset at P<5x10-8 and 94 at P<0.05. Five 
504 
additional loci previously shown to be associated with breast cancer in Asian women also showed 
505 
evidence in the European ancestry OncoArray dataset (P<0.01; Supplementary Tables 2-4)3-5. We 
506 
also assessed the association with breast cancer in Asians including 7,799 cases and 6,480 controls 
507 
from the OncoArray project and 6,269 cases and 6,624 controls from iCOGS. Of the 94 loci previously 
508 
identified in Europeans that were polymorphic in Asians, 50 showed evidence of association 
509 
(P<0.05). For the remaining 44, none showed a significant difference in the estimated odds ratio 
510 
(OR) for overall breast cancer between Europeans and Asians (P>0.01; Supplementary Table 5). The 
511 
correlation in effect sizes for all known loci between Europeans and Asians was 0.83, suggesting that 
512 
the majority of known susceptibility loci are shared between these populations. 
513 
 
514 
To search for additional susceptibility loci, we assessed all SNPs excluding those within 500kb of a 
515 
known susceptibility SNPs (Figure 1). This identified 5,969 variants in 65 regions that were associated 
516 
with overall breast cancer risk at P<5x10-8 (Table 1, Supplementary Tables 6-7). For two loci (lead 
517 
SNPs rs58847541 and rs12628403), there was evidence of a second association signal after 
518 
adjustment for the primary signal (rs13279803: conditional P=1.6x10-10; rs373038216: P=2.9x10-11; 
519 
Supplementary Table 8). Of the 65 new loci, 21 showed a differential association by ER-status 
520 
(P<0.05) with all but two (rs6725517 and rs6569648) more strongly associated with ER-positive 
521 
disease (Supplementary Tables 9-10). Forty-four loci showed evidence of association for ER-negative 
522 
breast cancer (P<0.05). Of the 51 novel loci that were polymorphic in Asians, nine were associated at 
523 
P<0.05 and only two showed a difference in the estimated OR between Europeans and Asians 
524 
(P<0.01; Supplementary Table 11). 
525 
 13 
 
To define a set of credible risk variants (CRVs) at the new loci, we first selected variants with P-values 
526 
within two orders of magnitude of the most significant SNPs in each region. Across the 65 novel 
527 
regions, we identified 2,221 CRVs (Supplementary Table 12), while the previous 77 identified loci 
528 
contained 2,232 CRVs (Online methods; Supplementary Table 13). We examined the evidence for 
529 
enrichment in these CRVs of 67 genomic features, including histone marks and transcription factor 
530 
binding sites (TFBS) in three breast cancer cell lines (Online Methods; Supplementary Tables 14-15; 
531 
Extended Data Fig. 1). Thirteen features were significant predictors of CRVs at P<10-4; the strongest 
532 
being DNAse I hypersensitivity sites in CTCF silenced MCF7 cells (OR 2.38, P=4.6x10-14). Strong 
533 
associations were also observed with binding sites for FOXA1, ESR1, GATA3, E2F1 and TCF7L2. Seven 
534 
of the 65 novel loci included only a single CRV (Supplementary Table 6), of which two are non-
535 
synonymous. SNP rs16991615 is a missense variant (p.Glu341Lys) in MCM8, involved in genome 
536 
replication and associated with age at natural menopause and impaired DNA repair6. SNP 
537 
rs35383942 is a missense variant (p.Arg28Gln) in PHLDA3, encoding a p53-regulated repressor of 
538 
AKT7.  
539 
 
540 
We annotated each CRV with publicly available genomic data from breast cells in order to highlight 
541 
potentially functional variants, predict target genes and prioritise future experimental validation 
542 
(Supplementary Tables 6 and 12 with UCSC browser links). We developed a heuristic scoring system 
543 
based on breast-specific genomic data (integrated expression quantitative trait and in silico 
544 
prediction of GWAS targets - INQUISIT) to rank the target genes at each locus (Supplementary Table 
545 
16). Target genes were predicted by combining risk SNP data with multiple sources of genomic 
546 
information, including chromatin interactions (ChIA-PET and Hi-C), computational enhancer-
547 
promoter correlations (PreSTIGE, IM-PET, FANTOM5 and Super-enhancers), breast tissue-specific 
548 
eQTL results, TF binding (ENCODE ChIP-seq), gene expression (ENCODE RNA-seq) and topologically-
549 
associated domain (TAD) boundaries (Online Methods and Supplementary Tables 17-19). Target 
550 
gene predictions could be made for 58/65 new and 70/77 previously identified loci. Among 689 
551 
protein-coding genes predicted by INQUISIT, we found strong enrichment for established breast 
552 
cancer drivers identified through tumour sequencing (20/147 genes, P<10-6)8-11, which increased 
553 
with increasing INQUISIT score (P=1.8x10-6). We compared INQUISIT with a) an alternative published 
554 
method (DEPICT, which predicts targets based on shared gene functions between potential targets 
555 
at other associated loci)12 which showed a weaker enrichment of breast cancer driver genes (P=0.06 
556 
after adjusting for the nearest gene, P=0.74 after adjusting for INQUIST score, and b) assigning the 
557 
association signal to the nearest gene, which showed only a weak enrichment of driver genes after 
558 
adjusting for the INQUISIT score (P=0.01; Extended Data Table 1 and Supplementary Table 20). 
559 
 14 
 
Notably, most of the 689 putative target genes have no reported involvement in breast 
560 
tumorigenesis and some may represent additional genes influencing susceptibility to breast cancer. 
561 
However, functional assays will be required to confirm any of these candidates as risk genes. 
562 
 
563 
Having used INQUISIT to predict target genes, we performed pathway gene set enrichment analysis 
564 
(GSEA), visually summarized as enrichment maps (Extended Data Fig. 2; Supplementary Tables 21-
565 
22)13. Several growth or development related pathways were enriched, notably the fibroblast 
566 
growth factor, platelet derived growth factor and Wnt signalling pathways14-16. Other cancer-related 
567 
themes included ERK1/2 cascade, immune-response pathways including interferon signalling, and 
568 
cell-cycle pathways. Pathways not found in earlier breast cancer GWAS include nitric oxide 
569 
biosynthesis, AP-1 transcription factor and NF-kB (Supplementary Table 23). 
570 
 
571 
To explore more globally the genomic features contributing to breast cancer risk, we estimated the 
572 
proportion of genome-wide SNP heritability attributable to 53 publicly available annotations17. We 
573 
observed the largest enrichment in heritability (5.2-fold, P=8.5x10-5) for TFBS, followed by a 4-fold 
574 
(P=0.0006) enrichment for histone marker H3K4me3 (marking promoters). In contrast, we observed 
575 
a significant depletion (0.27, P=0.0007) for repressed regions (Supplementary Table 24). We 
576 
conducted cell type-specific enrichment analysis for four histone marks and observed significant 
577 
enrichments in several tissue types (Figure 2; Extended Data Figs. 3-7; Supplementary Table 25-26), 
578 
including a 6.7-fold enrichment for H3K4me1 in breast myoepithelial tissue (P=7.9x10-5). We 
579 
compared the cell type-specific enrichments for overall, ER-positive and ER-negative breast cancer to 
580 
the enrichments for 16 other complex traits (Extended Data Figs. 3-7). Breast cancer showed 
581 
enrichment for adipose and epithelial cell types (including breast epithelial cells). In contrast, 
582 
psychiatric diseases showed enrichment specific to central-nervous-system cell types and 
583 
autoimmune disorders showed enrichment for immune cells. 
584 
 
585 
We selected for further evaluation four loci to represent those predicted to act through proximal 
586 
regulation (1p36 and 11p15) and distal regulation (1p34 and 7q22), because they had a relatively 
587 
small number of CRVs. The only CRV at 1p36, rs2992756 (P=1.6x10-15), is located 84bp from the 
588 
transcription start site of KLHDC7A. Of the 19 CRVs at 11p15 (smallest P=1.4x10-12), five were located 
589 
in the proximal promoter of PIDD1, implicated in DNA-damage-induced apoptosis and 
590 
tumorigenesis18. INQUIST predicted KLHDC7A and PIDD1 to be target genes and they received the 
591 
highest score for likelihood of promoter regulation (Supplementary Table 18). Using reporter assays, 
592 
we showed that the KLHDC7A promoter construct containing the risk T-allele of rs2992756 has 
593 
 15 
 
significantly lower activity than the reference construct, while the PIDD1 promoter construct 
594 
containing the risk haplotype significantly increased PIDD1 promoter activity (Extended Data Fig. 8). 
595 
 
596 
The 1p34 locus included four CRVs (smallest P=9.1x10-9) that fall within two putative regulatory 
597 
elements (PREs) and are predicted by INQUISIT to regulate CITED4 (PREs; Extended Data Fig. 8). 
598 
CITED4 encodes a transcriptional coactivator that interacts with CBP/p300 and TFAP2 and can inhibit 
599 
hypoxia-activated transcription in cancer cells19. Chromatin conformation capture (3C) assays 
600 
confirmed that the PREs physically interacted with the CITED4 promoter (Extended Data Fig. 8). 
601 
Subsequent reporter assays showed that the PRE1 reference construct reduced CITED4 promoter 
602 
activity, whereas the risk T-allele of SNP rs4233486 located in PRE1 negates this effect. 
603 
 
604 
Finally, the 7q22 risk locus contained six CRVs (smallest P=5.1x10-12) which lie in several PREs 
605 
spanning ~40kb of CUX1 intron 1. Chromatin interactions were identified between a PRE1 
606 
(containing SNP rs6979850) and CUX1/RASA4 promoters and a PRE2 (containing SNP rs71559437) 
607 
and RASA4/PRKRIP1 promoters (Extended Data Fig. 9). Allele-specific 3C in heterozygous MBA-MB-
608 
231 cells showed that the risk haplotype was associated with chromatin looping, suggesting that the 
609 
protective allele abrogates looping between the PREs and target genes (Extended Data Fig. 9). These 
610 
results identify two mechanisms by which CRVs may impact target gene expression: through 
611 
transactivation of a specific promoter and by affecting chromatin looping between regulatory 
612 
elements and their target genes. These data provide in vitro evidence of target identification and 
613 
regulation, however further studies that include genome editing, oncogenic assays and/or animal 
614 
models will be required to fully elucidate disease-related gene function.  
615 
 
 
616 
We estimate that the newly identified susceptibility loci explain ~4% of the two-fold familial relative 
617 
risk (FRR) of breast cancer and that in total, common susceptibility variants identified through GWAS 
618 
explain 18% of the FRR. Further, we estimate that variants imputable from the OncoArray, under a 
619 
log-additive model (see Online Methods), explain ~41% of the FRR, and thus, the identified 
620 
susceptibility SNPs account for ~44% (18%/41%) of the FRR that can be explained by all imputable 
621 
SNPs. The identified SNPs will be incorporated into risk prediction models, which can be used to 
622 
improve the identification of women at high and low risk of breast cancer: for example, using a 
623 
polygenic risk score based on the variants identified to date, women in the highest 1% of the 
624 
distribution have a 3.5-fold greater breast cancer risk than the population average. Such risk 
625 
prediction can inform targeted early detection and prevention.

Online Methods 
695 
Details of the studies and genotype calling and quality control (QC) for the iCOGS and eleven other 
696 
GWAS are described elsewhere2,20. Seventy-eight studies participated in the breast cancer 
697 
component of the OncoArray, of which 67 studies contributed European ancestry data and 12 
698 
contributed Asian ancestry data (one study, NBCS, was excluded as there were no controls from 
699 
Norway) (Supplementary Table 1). The majority of studies were population-based case-control 
700 
studies, or case-control studies nested within population-based cohorts, but a subset of studies 
701 
oversampled cases with a family history of the disease. All studies provided core data on disease 
702 
status and age at diagnosis/observation, and the majority provided additional data on clinico-
703 
pathological factors and lifestyle factors, which have been curated and incorporated into the BCAC 
704 
database (version 6). All participating studies were approved by their appropriate ethics review 
705 
board and all subjects provided informed consent.  
706 
OncoArray SNP Selection 
707 
Approximately 50% of the SNPs for the OncoArray were selected as a “GWAS backbone” (Illumina 
708 
HumanCore), which aimed to provide high coverage for the majority of common variants through 
709 
imputation. The remaining SNPs were selected from lists supplied by each of six disease-based 
710 
consortia, together with a seventh list of SNPs of interest to multiple disease-focused groups.

Approximately 72k SNPs were selected specifically for their relevance to breast cancer. These 
712 
included: (a) SNPs showing evidence of association from previous genotype data, based on a 
713 
combined analysis of eleven existing GWAS together the data from the iCOGS experiment; (b) SNPs 
714 
showing evidence of association with ER-negative disease (through a combined analysis with the 
715 
CIMBA consortium), triple negative disease, breast cancer diagnosed before age 40 years, high grade 
716 
disease, node positive disease or ductal carcinoma-in-situ; (c) SNPs potentially associated with 
717 
breast cancer survival; (d) SNPs selected for fine-mapping of 55 regions showing evidence of breast 
718 
cancer association at genome-wide significance; (e) rare variants showing evidence of association  
719 
through exome sequencing in multiple case families, whole-genome sequencing in high-risk cases 
720 
(DRIVE), or analysis of the ExomeChip (BCAC); (f) specific follow-up of regions of interest from breast 
721 
cancer GWAS in Asian, Latina and African/African-American women; (g) SNPs associated with breast 
722 
density, selected from GWAS conducted by the MODE consortium; (h) breast tissue-specific eQTLs (i) 
723 
lists of functional candidates from >30 groups. Lists were merged with lists from the other consortia 
724 
as described elsewhere1.  
725 
OncoArray Calling and QC 
726 
 23 
 
Of the 568,712 variants selected for genotyping, 533,631 were successfully manufactured on the 
727 
array (including 778 duplicate probes). Genotyping for the breast cancer component of the 
728 
OncoArray, which included 152,492 samples, was conducted at six sites. Details of the genotyping 
729 
calling for the OncoArray are described in more detail elsewhere1. Briefly, we developed a single 
730 
calling pipeline that was applied to more than 500,000 samples. An initial cluster file was generated 
731 
using data from 56,284 samples, selected to cover all the major genotyping centres and ethnicities, 
732 
using the Gentrain2 algorithm. Variants likely to have problematic clusters were selected for manual 
733 
inspection using the following criteria: call rate below 99%, variants with minor allele frequency 
734 
(MAF)<0.001, poor Illumina intensity and clustering metrics, or deviation from the expected 
735 
frequency as observed in the 1000 Genomes Project. This resulted in manual adjustment of the 
736 
cluster file for 3,964 variants, and the exclusion of 16,526 variants. The final cluster file was then 
737 
applied to the full dataset. 
738 
We excluded probable duplicates and close relatives within each study, and probable duplicates 
739 
across studies. We excluded samples with a call rate <95% or samples with extreme heterozygosity 
740 
(4.89 SD from the mean for the ethnicity). Ancestry was computed using a principal component 
741 
analysis, applied to the full OncoArray dataset, using 2318 informative markers on a subset of 
742 
~47,000 samples. The analysis presented here was restricted to women of European ancestry, 
743 
defined as individuals with an estimated proportion of European ancestry >0.8, and women of East 
744 
Asian ancestry (estimated proportion of Asian ancestry >0.4), with reference to the HapMap (v2) 
745 
populations, based on the first two principal components. After quality control exclusions and 
746 
removing overlaps with the previous iCOGS and GWAS genotyping used in the analysis, the final 
747 
dataset comprised data from 61,282 cases and 45,494 of European ancestry 7,799 cases and 6,480 
748 
controls of Asian ancestry. 
749 
We excluded SNPs with a call rate <95% in any consortium, SNPs not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium 
750 
(P<10-7 in controls or P <10-12 in cases) and SNPs with concordance <98% among 5,280 duplicate 
751 
sample pairs. For the imputation, we additionally excluded SNPs with a MAF<1% and a call rate <98% 
752 
in any consortium, SNPs that could not be linked to the 1000 Genomes Project reference or differed 
753 
significantly in frequency from the 1000 Genomes Project dataset (using the criterion 
754 
��������
������������������ � �����, where p0 and p1 are the MAFs in the 1000 Genomes Project and 
755 
OncoArray European datasets, respectively). A further 1,128 SNPs where the cluster plot was judged 
756 
to be not ideal on visual inspection were excluded. Of the 533,631 SNPs that were manufactured on 
757 
the array, 494,763 SNPs passed the initial QC and 469,364 SNPs were used in the imputation. 
758 
Genotype Imputation 
759 
 24 
 
All samples were imputed using the October 2014 (version 3) release of the 1000 Genomes Project 
760 
dataset as the reference panel and number of sampled haplotypes per individual (Nhap)=800. The 
761 
iCOGS, OncoArray and nine of the GWAS datasets were imputed using a two-stage imputation 
762 
approach, using SHAPEIT2 for phasing and IMPUTEv2 for imputation21,22. The imputation was 
763 
performed in 5Mb non-overlapping intervals. The subjects were split into subsets of ~10,000 
764 
samples; where possible subjects from the same study were included in the same subset. The BPC3 
765 
and EBCG studies were imputed separately using MACH and Minimac23,24. 99.6% of SNPs with 
766 
frequency >1% were imputable with r2>0.3 in the OncoArray dataset and 99.1% in the iCOGS 
767 
dataset. We generated estimated genotypes for all SNPs that were polymorphic (MAF>0.1%) in 
768 
either European or Asian samples (~21M SNPs). For the current analysis, however, we restricted to 
769 
SNPs with MAF>0.5% in the European OncoArray dataset (11.8M SNPs). One-step imputation 
770 
(without pre-phasing) was performed, on the iCOGS and OncoArray datasets, as a quality control 
771 
step for those associated loci where the imputation quality score was <0.9. Imputation quality for 
772 
the lead variants, as assessed by the IMPUTE2 quality score in the OncoArray dataset, was >0.80 for 
773 
all but one locus (Supplementary Table 27) rs72749841, quality score=0.65).  
774 
 
775 
Principal Components Analysis 
776 
To adjust for potential (intra-continental) population stratification in the OncoArray dataset, 
777 
principal components analysis was performed using data from 33,661 uncorrelated SNPs (which 
778 
included 2,318 SNPs specifically selected on informativeness for determining continental ancestry) 
779 
with a MAF of at least 0.05 and maximum correlation of 0.1 in the OncoArray dataset, using 
780 
purpose-written software (http://ccge.medschl.cam.ac.uk/software/pccalc). For the main analyses, 
781 
we used the first ten principal components, as additional components did not further reduce 
782 
inflation in the test statistics. We used nine principal components for the iCOGS and up to ten 
783 
principal components for the other GWAS, where this was found to reduce inflation. 
784 
Statistical Analyses 
785 
Per-allele ORs and standard errors were generated for the OncoArray, iCOGS and each GWAS, 
786 
adjusting for principal components using logistic regression. The OncoArray and iCOGS analyses 
787 
were additionally adjusted for country and study, respectively. For the OncoArray analysis, we 
788 
adjusted for country and 10 principal components. Adjustment for country rather than study was 
789 
used to improve power since some studies had no few or no controls. We evaluated the adequacy of 
790 
this approach by comparing the inflation in the test statistic with that obtained in corresponding 
791 
 25 
 
analysis in which we adjusted for study – the inflation was very similar (�=1.15 vs. 1.17, based on the 
792 
backbone SNPs, equivalent to �1000=1.003, for a study of 1,000 cases and 1,000 controls, in both 
793 
cases). As an additional sensitivity analysis, we computed the effect sizes for the 65 novel loci 
794 
adjusting for study – the effect sizes were essentially identical to those presented. Estimates were 
795 
derived using ProbAbel for the BPC3 and EBCG studies25, SNPTEST for the remaining GWAS and 
796 
purpose written software for the iCOGS and OncoArray datasets. OR estimates and standard errors 
797 
were combined in a fixed effects inverse variance meta-analysis using METAL26, adjusting the GWAS 
798 
(but not iCOGS or OncoArray) results for genomic control as described previously2. For the GWAS, 
799 
results were included in the analysis for all SNPs with MAF>0.01 and imputation r2>0.3. For iCOGS 
800 
and OncoArray we included all SNPs with r2>=0.3 and MAF>0.005 (11.8M SNPs in total). We viewed 
801 
the primary tests of association as those based on all the meta-analysis over all stages, as this has 
802 
been shown to be powerful than tests based on a test-replication approach27. Eight sets of variants 
803 
were associated with breast cancer at P<5x10-8 but were close to previous susceptibility regions, and 
804 
these became non-significant after adjustment for the previously identified lead variant. Two SNPs 
805 
on 22q13.2, rs141447235 and rs73161324, were both associated with overall breast cancer but, 
806 
despite lying >500kb apart, were strongly correlated with each other (r2=0.50) and hence were 
807 
considered as a single novel signal.  
808 
 
809 
For SNPs showing evidence of association, we additionally computed genotype-specific ORs for the 
810 
iCOGS and OncoArray dataset, and per-allele ORs for ER-negative and ER-positive disease. 
811 
Departures from a log-additive model were evaluated using a one degree of freedom likelihood ratio 
812 
test, comparing the log-additive model (genotypes parametrised as the number of rare alleles 
813 
carried) with the general model estimating ORs for each genotype. The genotype-specific risks for all 
814 
variants were consistent with a log-additive model (P>0.01; Supplementary Table 28). Tests for 
815 
differences in the OR by ER-status were derived using case-only analyses, in which estimates were 
816 
derived by logistic regression separately in the iCOGS and OncoArray datasets, adjusted as before, 
817 
and then combined in a fixed-effects meta-analysis. These analyses were performed in R28. 
818 
We assessed heterogeneity in the OR estimates among studies within each of the OncoArray, iCOGS 
819 
and GWAS components, and between the (combined) estimates for the three components, using 
820 
both the I2 statistic and the P-value for Cochran’s Q statistic (Supplementary Table 27). There was no 
821 
evidence of heterogeneity among studies in the ORs for any of the loci in the OncoArray, but three 
822 
loci showed some evidence of heterogeneity in the ORs among the GWAS, iCOGS and OncoArray 
823 
datasets.  
824 
 26 
 
To determine whether there were multiple independent signals in a given region, we performed 
825 
multiple logistic regression analysis using SNPs within 500kb of each lead SNP, adjusting for the lead 
826 
SNP. We used the genotypes derived by one-step imputation, performed the analyses separately in 
827 
the iCOGS and Oncoarray datasets and combined the results (adjusted effect sizes and standard 
828 
errors) using a fixed effects meta-analysis. For one of the two loci for which there was an additional 
829 
signal significant at P<5x10-8, the lead SNP from the one-step imputation differed from the lead SNP 
830 
in the overall analysis, but was strongly correlated with it (Supplementary Table 8). 
831 
 
832 
Definition of Known Hits 
833 
We attempted to identify all associations previously reported from genome-wide or candidate 
834 
analysis at a significance level P<5x10-8 for overall breast cancer, ER-negative or ER-positive breast 
835 
cancer, in BRCA1 or BRCA2 carriers, or in meta-analyses of these categories. Where multiple studies 
836 
reported associations in the same region, we used the first reported association unless later studies 
837 
identified a variant that was clearly more strongly associated. We only included one SNP per 500kb 
838 
interval, unless joint analysis provided clear evidence (P<5x10-8) of more than one independent 
839 
signal. For the analysis of credible risk variants (CRVs), we restricted attention to regions where the 
840 
most significant signal had a P-value<10-7 in Europeans (77 regions). To avoid complications with 
841 
defining CRVs for secondary signals, we considered only the primary signal and defined CRVs as 
842 
those whose P-value was within two orders of magnitude of the most significant P-value. 
843 
In-Silico Analysis of CRVs 
844 
We combined multiple sources of in silico functional annotation from public databases to help 
845 
identify potential functional SNPs and target genes. To investigate functional elements enriched 
846 
across the region encompassing the strongest CRVs, we analysed chromatin biofeatures data from 
847 
the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Project29, Roadmap Epigenomics Projects30 and other 
848 
data obtained through the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Gene Expression 
849 
Omnibus (GEO) namely: Chromatin State Segmentation by Hidden Markov Models (chromHMM), 
850 
DNase I hypersensitive and histone modifications of epigenetic markers H3K4, H3K9, and H3K27 in 
851 
Human Mammary Epithelial (HMEC) and myoepithelial (MYO) cells, T47D and MCF7 breast cancer 
852 
cells and TF ChIP-seq in a range of breast cell lines (Supplementary Table 12). 
853 
Association of Genomic Features with CRVs 
854 
 27 
 
We first defined credible candidate variants as those located within 500kb of the most significant 
855 
SNP in each region, and with P-values within two orders of magnitude of the most significant SNPs. 
856 
This is approximately equivalent to flagging variants whose posterior probability of causality is within 
857 
two orders of magnitude of that of the most significant SNP31,32. We then selected 800 random 1Mb 
858 
control regions separated by at least 1Mb from each other and from the intervals defined by the 
859 
associated SNPs. The association with each feature was then evaluated using logistic regression, with 
860 
being a CRV as the outcome, and adjusting for the dependence due to linkage disequilibrium using 
861 
robust variance estimation, clustering on region, using the R package multiwayvcov. 
862 
eQTL analyses 
863 
Expression QTL analyses were performed using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and 
864 
Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) projects9,33. The TCGA 
865 
eQTL analysis was based on 458 breast tumours that had matched gene expression, copy number, 
866 
and methylation profiles together with the corresponding germline genotypes available. All 458 
867 
individuals were of European ancestry as ascertained using the genotype data and the Local 
868 
Ancestry in adMixed Populations (LAMP) software package (LAMP estimate cut-off >95% 
869 
European)34. Germline genotypes were imputed into the 1000 Genomes Project reference panel 
870 
(October 2014 release) using IMPUTE223,35. Gene expression had been measured on the Illumina 
871 
HiSeq 2000 RNA-Seq platform (gene-level RSEM normalized counts36), copy number estimates were 
872 
derived from the Affymetrix SNP 6.0 (somatic copy number alteration minus germline copy number 
873 
variation called using the GISTIC2 algorithm37), and methylation beta values measured on the 
874 
Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450. Expression QTL analysis focused on all variants within 500 
875 
kb of the most significantly associated risk SNP in 142 genomic regions (each 2-Mb wide) containing 
876 
at least one previously identified or new overall breast cancer risk locus confirmed at genome-wide 
877 
significance in the current meta-analysis. Each variant was evaluated for its association with the 
878 
expression of every gene within 2 Mb that had been profiled for each of the three data types. The 
879 
effects of tumour copy number and methylation on gene expression were first regressed out using a 
880 
method described previously38. eQTL analysis was performed by linear regression, with residual gene 
881 
expression as outcome, germline SNP genotype dosage as the covariate of interest and ESR1 
882 
expression and age as additional covariates, using the R package Matrix eQTL39. 
883 
The METABRIC eQTL analysis was based on 138 normal breast tissue samples resected from breast 
884 
cancer patients of European ancestry. Germline genotyping for the METABRIC study was also done 
885 
on the Affymetrix SNP 6.0 array, and gene expression in the METABRIC study was measured using 
886 
the Illumina HT12 microarray platform (probe-level estimates). No adjustment was implemented for 
887 
 28 
 
somatic copy number and methylation status since we were evaluating eQTLs in normal breast 
888 
tissue. All other steps were identical to the TCGA eQTL analysis described above. 
889 
 
890 
INQUISIT  
891 
We developed a computational pipeline, integrated expression quantitative trait and in silico 
892 
prediction of GWAS targets (INQUISIT), to interrogate publically available data for the prioritisation 
893 
of candidate target genes.  
894 
 
895 
Data used for INQUISIT: Chromatin interaction data from ENCODE ChIA-PET analysis in MCF-7 cells 
896 
for RNApolII, ERalpha, and CTCF factors were downloaded using UCSC Table Browser40. Hi-C data 
897 
derived from HMECs were obtained from Rao et al.41, using “interaction loops” as defined in the 
898 
publication. Data were reformatted to facilitate intersection of query SNPs using BEDTools 
899 
“intersect”42. For all interactions, termini were intersected with promoters using GENCODE v1943 
900 
Basic gene annotations, where we defined promoters as -1.0 kb - +0.1 kb surrounding a transcription 
901 
start site.  
902 
 
903 
Enhancer-target gene predictions by several computational algorithms were collected. Each of these 
904 
datasets assigns genes to enhancers. We used all MCF-7 and HMEC enhancer predictions (low and 
905 
high stringency) made by PreSTIGE44, IM-PET enhancer-gene predictions in MCF-7, HMEC and 
906 
HCC1954 cell lines45. Enhancer-transcription start site (E-TSS) links were identified from the 
907 
FANTOM5 Consortium were identified46, and enhancers detected in mammary epithelial cells were 
908 
intersected with E-TSS links. We also collected typical and super-enhancers in MCF-7, HMEC and 
909 
HCC1954 cells defined by Hnisz et al.47. 
910 
 
911 
TF ChIP-seq peak data for ESR1, FOXA1, GATA3, TCF7L2 and E2F1 from MCF-7, T47D and MCF-10A 
912 
cells were downloaded in narrowPeak format from ENCODE. H3K4me3 and H3K9ac (characteristic of 
913 
promoters) histone modification ChIP-seq peak data for all breast cells were obtained from ENCODE 
914 
and Roadmap Epigenomics Project. ChromHMM data for breast cell samples (HMEC and 
915 
myoepithelial: E027, E028 and E119) were downloaded from Roadmap Epigenomics.  
916 
 
917 
Expression QTL analyses were conducted as described above. In the interpretation of the eQTL 
918 
results for INQUISIT (and in general) we focused on the overlap between the CRVs (risk signal) and 
919 
the top eQTL variants for a given gene (eQTL signal). If the eQTL P-value for a CRV was the same as, 
920 
or within 1/100th of the eQTL P-value of the SNP most significantly associated with expression of a 
921 
 29 
 
particular gene, that gene and the corresponding CRV were assigned a point for being an eQTL in 
922 
INQUISIT. 
923 
 
924 
Topologically-associated domain (TAD) boundaries were derived from Hi-C data41. Genomic intervals 
925 
corresponding to “contact domains” from eight human cell types were merged using BEDTools 
926 
“merge” resulting in annotation of regions most likely to encompass TAD units. Inter-TAD 
927 
boundaries were identified using BEDTools “complement”.  
928 
 
929 
Gene level RNA-seq expression data generated under multiple experimental conditions in MCF-7 and 
930 
normal mammary epithelial cells were downloaded from ENCODE. The FPKM (Fragments Per 
931 
Kilobase of exon per Million fragments Mapped) values for each gene were extracted using the 
932 
metagene R package48 and averaged across all experiments to give an approximation of expression 
933 
in breast cells. Accession numbers are given in Supplementary Table 29. 
934 
 
935 
INQUISIT pipeline 
936 
Candidate target genes were evaluated by assessing each CRV’s potential impact on regulatory or 
937 
coding features. Scores categorised by 1) distal gene regulation, 2) proximal gene regulation, or 3) 
938 
impact on protein coding were calculated using the following criteria (see also Supplementary Table 
939 
16).  
940 
 
941 
Genomic annotation data for target gene predictions (chromatin interaction and computational 
942 
enhancer-promoter assignment), ChIP-seq, histone modification, and chromHMM were curated into 
943 
a BED formatted database. We intersected the chromosomal positions of CRVs with each category of 
944 
genomic annotation data using BEDTools “intersect” (minimum 1 bp overlap), resulting in 
945 
annotation of SNP-gene pairs with presence or absence of multiple classes of genomic data. Each 
946 
gene was scored using a custom R script on the basis of the following criteria: 
947 
- For distally regulated genes, a candidate gene was given 2 points if a CRV fell in an element that 
948 
revealed long range ChIA-PET or Hi-C interactions with that gene’s promoter. One point was 
949 
added to a gene's score in the case of enhancers predicted by computational methods to target 
950 
that gene (in addition to experimental interactions if also observed). If the distal elements 
951 
harbouring SNPs also overlapped enriched cistromic TF (ESR1, FOXA1, GATA3, TCF7L2, E2F1) 
952 
ChIP-seq peaks, an additional point was given when one SNP-Enhancer-ChIP-seq peak 
953 
intersection occurred, but two points when there were multiple TF binding sites overlapping SNPs 
954 
in distinct interactions or enhancers (see Supplementary Table 16 for details). One point was 
955 
 30 
 
given to significant eSNP-eGENE pairs. Predicted distal target genes which were among the list of 
956 
breast cancer driver genes were up-weighted with a further point (except for the analysis of 
957 
driver gene enrichment). Information regarding TAD boundaries was used to down-weight genes: 
958 
genes which were separated from CRVs by a TAD boundary were down-weighted by multiplying 
959 
their scores by 0.05. Scores for genes exhibiting no expression in MCF7 or HMEC (mean FPKM = 
960 
0) were multiplied by 0.1. This resulted in scores for each candidate target gene ranging from 0 to 
961 
8. 
962 
- Variants were treated as potentially affecting proximal promoter regulation if they resided 
963 
between -1.0 and +0.1 kb surrounding a transcription start site. Additional points was awarded to 
964 
genes when variants overlapped promoter H3K4me3 or H3K9ac histone modification peaks, 
965 
intersected with ESR1, FOXA1, GATA3, TCF7L2 or E2F1 TF binding sites, were significant eSNP-
966 
eGENE pairs, and if the gene was annotated as a breast cancer driver gene. Gene scores were 
967 
down-weighted (by a factor of 0.1) if they lacked expression in MCF-7 or HMEC samples. 
968 
Resultant scores ranged from 0 to 5. 
969 
- Intragenic variants were evaluated for their potential to impact protein function using a range of 
970 
in silico prediction tools (CADD49, FATHMM50, LRT51, MutationAssessor52, Mutation Taster 253, 
971 
PolyPhen-254, PROVEAN55 and SIFT56 for missense variants; Human Splicing Finder57 and 
972 
MaxEntScan58 for splice variants). We scored genes with missense and nonsense variants 
973 
predicted to be functionally deleterious, and points for genes harbouring variants predicted to 
974 
alter splicing. Genes could therefore carry SNPs which affect coding and splicing and receive 
975 
increased scores. Additional points were given to genes which were breast cancer driver genes. 
976 
We multiplied scores by 0.1 when genes showed a lack of expression in breast cells. Possible 
977 
coding scores ranged from 0-4. 
978 
 
979 
Enrichment of Somatic Breast Cancer Driver Genes in INQUISIT Target Gene Predictions 
980 
We listed 147 unique protein coding driver genes for breast cancer identified from four recent 
981 
tumour genome and exome sequencing studies (considering ZNF703 and FGFR1 as independent 
982 
genes; Supplementary Table 30)8-11. First, we examined overlap between this list of 147 genes and 
983 
the total set of unique target genes predicted by INQUISIT (n = 689) by one or more of the three 
984 
regulatory mechanisms (distal, promoter, and coding). The significance of this overlap was assessed 
985 
by randomly drawing (without replacement) 689 genes from the set of all protein coding genes 
986 
(GENCODE release 19, n = 20,243) one million times and calculating the probability of observing the 
987 
same (or stronger) overlap with the list of 147 drivers. Second, we hypothesised that this enrichment 
988 
would be stronger with progressively higher INQUISIT scores. We categorised all 20,243 protein

coding genes into four levels based on their INQUIST scores (level 1: coding score 2, promoter score 
990 
3-4, distal score >4; level 2: coding 1, promoter 1-2, distal 1-4; level 3: any score >0 but <1; level 4: 
991 
score 0 i.e. not a predicted target). The gene nearest to a risk locus is frequently assigned as a 
992 
candidate target gene in GWAS in the absence of additional functional analysis59. We observed that 
993 
seven of the 147 drivers were among the genes nearest to a previously or newly identified breast 
994 
cancer risk locus. Therefore, we used logistic regression, including data for all target genes predicted 
995 
by INQUISIT, with driver status as outcome, and evaluated INQUISIT score level and nearest gene 
996 
status as potential predictors of driver status (Supplementary Table 20).  
997 
 
998 
Lead SNPs at 142 breast cancer risk associated loci were used as input into DEPICT which was then 
999 
run using the default settings12. We examined the relative performance of INQUISIT and DEPICT in 
1000 
predicting driver gene status using logistic regression models as above (Supplementary Table 20), 
1001 
adding DEPICT prediction as a covariate.  
1002 
Chromatin Conformation Capture (3C)  
1003 
MCF7 (ATCC #HTB22) and MDA-MB-231 (ATCC #HTB26) breast cancer cell lines were grown in RPMI 
1004 
medium with 10% FCS and antibiotics. Bre-80 normal breast epithelial cells (provided as a gift from 
1005 
Roger Reddel, CMRI, Sydney) were grown in DMEM/F12 medium with 5% horse serum (HS), 10 
1006 
µg/ml insulin, 0.5 µg/ml hydrocortisone, 20 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 100 ng/ml cholera toxin 
1007 
and antibiotics. Cell lines were maintained under standard conditions, routinely tested for 
1008 
Mycoplasma and short tandem repeat (STR) profiled to confirm cell line identity. 3C libraries were 
1009 
generated using EcoRI as described previously60. 3C interactions were quantitated by real-time PCR 
1010 
(qPCR) using primers designed within restriction fragments (Supplementary Table 31). qPCR was 
1011 
performed on a RotorGene 6000 using MyTaq HS DNA polymerase (Bioline) with the addition of 5 
1012 
mM of Syto9, annealing temperature of 66oC and extension of 30 sec. 3C analyses were performed 
1013 
in three independent 3C libraries from each cell line with each experiment quantified in duplicate. 
1014 
BAC clones covering each region were used to create artificial libraries of ligation products in order 
1015 
to normalize for PCR efficiency. Data were normalized to the signal from the BAC clone library and, 
1016 
between cell lines, by reference to a region within GAPDH. All qPCR products were electrophoresed 
1017 
on 2% agarose gels, gel purified and sequenced to verify the 3C product.  
1018 
 
1019 
Plasmid Construction and Reporter Assays 
1020 
Promoter-driven luciferase reporter constructs were generated by insertion of PCR amplified 
1021 
fragments or synthesised gBlocks (Integrated DNA Technologies) containing the KLHDC7A, PIDD1 or 
1022 
 32 
 
CITED4 promoters into the KpnI/HindIII sites of pGL3-Basic. For the 1p34 locus, a 1169 bp putative 
1023 
regulatory element (PRE1) or 951 bp PRE2 were synthesised as gBlocks and cloned into the 
1024 
BamHI/SalI sites of the CITED4-promoter construct. The minor alleles of SNPs were introduced into 
1025 
promoter or PRE sequences by overlap extension PCR or gBlocks. Sequencing of all constructs 
1026 
confirmed variant incorporation (AGRF). MCF7 or Bre-80 cells were transfected with equimolar 
1027 
amounts of luciferase reporter plasmids and 50 ng of pRLTK transfection control plasmid with 
1028 
Lipofectamine 2000. The total amount of transfected DNA was kept constant at 600 ng for each 
1029 
construct by the addition of pUC19 as a carrier plasmid. Luciferase activity was measured 24 hr 
1030 
posttransfection by the Dual-Glo Luciferase Assay System. To correct for any differences in 
1031 
transfection efficiency or cell lysate preparation, Firefly luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla 
1032 
luciferase, and the activity of each construct was measured relative to the reference promoter 
1033 
constructs, which had a defined activity of 1. Statistical significance was tested by log transforming 
1034 
the data and performing 2-way ANOVA, followed by Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test in 
1035 
GraphPad Prism.  
1036 
 
1037 
Global Genomic Enrichment Analyses 
1038 
We performed stratified LD score regression analyses17 for overall breast cancer as well as stratified 
1039 
by ER status using the summary statistics based on the meta-analyses of the OncoArray, GWAS and 
1040 
iCOGS datasets. We restricted analysis to all SNPs present on the HapMap version 3 dataset that had 
1041 
a MAF > 1% and an imputation quality score R2>0.3 in the OncoArray data. LD scores were calculated 
1042 
using the 1000 Genomes Project Phase 3 EUR reference panel. 
1043 
We first created a “full baseline model” as previously described that included 24 non-cell type 
1044 
specific publicly available annotations as well as 24 additional annotations that included a 500-bp 
1045 
window around each of the 24 main annotations17. Additionally, we also included 100-bp windows 
1046 
around ChIP-seq peaks as well as one annotation containing all SNPs leading to a total of 53 
1047 
overlapping annotations. 
1048 
We subsequently performed analyses using cell-type specific annotations for four histone marks 
1049 
H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K9ac and H3K27ac across 27-81 cell types depending on histone mark17. 
1050 
Each cell-type-specific annotation corresponded to a histone mark in a single cell type, and there 
1051 
were 220 such annotations in total. We augmented the baseline model by adding these annotations 
1052 
individually, creating 220 separate models, each with 54 annotations (53+1). This procedure controls 
1053 
for the overlap with the 53 functional categories in the full baseline model but not with the 219 
1054 
other cell type specific annotations. 
1055 
 33 
 
We further tested the differences in functional enrichment between ER-positive and ER-negative 
1056 
subsets through a Wald test, using the regression coefficients and standard errors for the two 
1057 
subsets based on the models described above.  
1058 
 
1059 
Contribution of Identified Variants to the Familial Relative Risk of Breast Cancer 
1060 
We estimated the proportion of the familial risk of breast cancer due to the identified variants, 
1061 
under a log-additive model, using the formula: 
1062 
� ���� � ��
�
����
� � ��
�� ln 
���
�
), where �� is the MAF for variant i, ��is the log(OR) estimate for 
1063 
variant i, �i is the standard error of �i and �=2 is the assumed overall familial relative risk. 
1064 
 
1065 
To compute the corresponding estimate for the FRR due to all variants, we wish to estimate 
1066 
��
� � � ����� � ��
�
���
� where the sum is now over the all variants and �i is the true relative risk 
1067 
conferred by variant i, assuming a log-additive model. We refer to ��
� as the frailty scale heritability. 
1068 
We first obtained the estimated observed heritability based on the full set of summary estimates 
1069 
using LD Score Regression17 and then converted this to an estimate on the frailty scale using the 
1070 
��
� � ����
�
��� � ��

, where P is the proportion of samples in the population that are cases.

Pathway Analyses 
1073 
The 
pathway 
gene 
set 
database 
(http://download.baderlab.org/EM_Genesets, 
file 
1074 
Human_GOBP_AllPathways_no_GO_iea_April_01_2017_symbol.gmt)13 from the Bader lab dated 
1075 
April 1, 2017 was used in all analyses. This database contains pathways from Reactome61, NCI 
1076 
Pathway Interaction Database62, GO (Gene Ontology) biological process63, HumanCyc64, MSigdb65, 
1077 
NetPath66 and Panther67. For GO, terms inferred from electronic annotation were excluded from our 
1078 
analyses. The same pathway may be defined in two or more databases with potentially different sets 
1079 
of genes. All versions of such ‘duplicate’ pathways were included. To provide more biologically 
1080 
meaningful results and reduce false positives, only pathways that contained between 10 and 200 
1081 
genes were used. Pathway size was determined by the total number of genes in the pathway that 
1082 
could also be mapped to the genes included in the GWAS dataset (actual pathway size may be 
1083 
larger). 
1084 
 34 
 
 
1085 
SNPs were assigned to genes using the INQUISIT target prediction method described above for all 
1086 
SNPs with P-value < 5x10-2 (~1.25 million associations). This cutoff was chosen based on a threshold 
1087 
analysis that showed that 19 of the 20 pathway themes found using all SNP associations (~16 million) 
1088 
and a simple distance-based SNP-to-gene mapping method could be recovered using this smaller 
1089 
subset of associations. More stringent cutoffs resulted in fewer themes being covered (e.g. three 
1090 
themes found using SNPs with p-value < 5x10-6 or ~33K SNP associations). Gene significance was 
1091 
calculated by assigning the statistic of the most significant SNP among all SNPs assigned to a 
1092 
gene68,69. Since histone genes contained a high number of mapped SNPs, we selected representative 
1093 
SNP associations to avoid pathway enrichments based solely on the increased number of SNPs at 
1094 
these loci (i.e. chr6:27657944 for HIST1, chr1:149219841, for HIST2, chr1: 228517406 for HIST3, 
1095 
chr12: 14871747 for HIST4). 
1096 
 
1097 
The gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) algorithm as implemented in the GenGen package69 was 
1098 
used to perform pathway analysis. Wang et al.70  modified the original GSEA algorithm to work with 
1099 
GWAS datasets, using SNP significance and SNP-to-gene mapping instead of gene expression data. 
1100 
Briefly, the algorithm calculates an enrichment score (ES) for each pathway based on a weighted 
1101 
Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic (refer to 70 for more details). Pathways that have most of their genes 
1102 
at the top of the ranked list of genes obtain higher ES values. Note that only the largest positive ES 
1103 
was considered as opposed to largest absolute ES (i.e. largest deviation from zero). This modification 
1104 
(recommended by the GenGen authors for GWAS analysis) was performed to include only pathways 
1105 
that are significantly affected between cases and controls and ignore those with significant negative 
1106 
ES values (this may happen if a pathway is significantly less altered than expected by chance). Only 
1107 
pathways containing greater than 10 genes with at least one of these genes with P-value < 5x10-8 
1108 
were retained as higher confidence for subsequent analysis. These pathways, together with the 
1109 
genes reaching the significance threshold, are listed in Supplementary Table 21. 
1110 
 
1111 
The pathway analysis assigns an enrichment score (ES) value for each pathway.  These values were 
1112 
normalized and p-values for each pathway were obtained by comparing them to null distributions 
1113 
for OncoArray and iCOGS data sets separately.  The null distributions were computed by permuting 
1114 
case/control labels 1,000 times (keeping the number of cases and controls the same in each 
1115 
iteration) and recomputing all enrichment statistics.  FDR values were computed using the statistics 
1116 
from the null distributions and all pathways with FDR < 0.05 in either OncoArray or iCOGS 
1117 
distributions were considered further. Pathway findings were further considered if they contained 
1118 
 35 
 
more than one significant gene and if they could be confirmed to be involved in breast cancer as 
1119 
reported in at least one of five published large-scale breast cancer GWAS71-75 or reported elsewhere 
1120 
in the literature. Further, themes that were weakly associated with breast cancer (based on a 
1121 
literature search) were only included if they had a FDR < 0.05 and at least four novel genes (i.e. was 
1122 
not found among the genes from mapped themes containing pathways known to be involved in 
1123 
breast cancer) (Extended Data Fig. 2). Pathways related to “sensory perception of smell” were 
1124 
removed as there is no literature evidence for their involvement in breast cancer and because they 
1125 
contain genes close to each other on chromosome 6 which are frequently correlated.  
1126 
 
1127 
An enrichment map was created using the Enrichment Map (EM) v 2.1.0 app13 in Cytoscape v 3.376. 
1128 
Pathways nodes were laid out using a force directed layout and nodes with gene set overlap of over 
1129 
0.55 were connected by edges. Related pathway nodes were manually clustered and labelled as 
1130 
themes.

overall breast cancer risk. The overlaps between potential genomic predictors in relevant breast 
1368 
cell lines and candidate causal risk variants (CRVs) within each locus. On the x-axis, each column 
1369 
represents a CRV (see Online Methods). The most significant SNPs are identified in each region. 
1370 
On the y-axis, biofeatures are grouped into five functional categories: genomic structure (red), 
1371 
enhancer marks (dark green), histone marks (blue), open chromatin marks (dark blue) and 
1372 
transcription factor binding sites (dark violet). Colored elements indicate SNPs for which the 
1373 
feature is present. For data sources, see Online Methods (“In-Silico Analysis of CRVs”).

enrichment score (ES) where redder nodes indicate lower FDRs. Larger nodes indicate pathways 
1378 
with more genes. Green lines connect pathways with overlapping genes (minimum overlap 
1379
