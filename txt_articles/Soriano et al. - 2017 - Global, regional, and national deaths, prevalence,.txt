Global, regional, and national deaths, prevalence, 
disability-adjusted life years, and years lived with disability 
for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma, 
1990–2015: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of 
Disease Study 2015
GBD 2015 Chronic Respiratory Disease Collaborators*
Summary
Background Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma are common diseases with a heterogeneous 
distribution worldwide. Here, we present methods and disease and risk estimates for COPD and asthma from the Global 
Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors (GBD) 2015 study. The GBD study provides annual updates on estimates 
of deaths, prevalence, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), a summary measure of fatal and non-fatal disease 
outcomes, for over 300 diseases and injuries, for 188 countries from 1990 to the most recent year.
Methods We estimated numbers of deaths due to COPD and asthma using the GBD Cause of Death Ensemble modelling 
(CODEm) tool. First, we analysed data from vital registration and verbal autopsy for the aggregate category of all chronic 
respiratory diseases. Subsequently, models were run for asthma and COPD relying on covariates to predict rates in 
countries that have incomplete or no vital registration data. Disease estimates for COPD and asthma were based on 
systematic reviews of published papers, unpublished reports, surveys, and health service encounter data from the USA. 
We used the Global Initiative of Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease spirometry-based definition as the reference for 
COPD and a reported diagnosis of asthma with current wheeze as the definition of asthma. We used a Bayesian meta-
regression tool, DisMod-MR 2.1, to derive estimates of prevalence and incidence. We estimated population-attributable 
fractions for risk factors for COPD and asthma from exposure data, relative risks, and a theoretical minimum exposure 
level. Results were stratified by Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a composite measure of income per capita, mean years 
of education over the age of 15 years, and total fertility rate.
Findings In 2015, 3·2 million people (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 3·1 million to 3·3 million) died from COPD 
worldwide, an increase of 11·6% (95% UI 5·3 to 19·8) compared with 1990. There was a decrease in age-standardised 
death rate of 41·9% (37·7 to 45·1) but this was counteracted by population growth and ageing of the global population. 
From 1990 to 2015, the prevalence of COPD increased by 44·2% (41·7 to 46·6), whereas age-standardised prevalence 
decreased by 14·7% (13·5 to 15·9). In 2015, 0·40 million people (0·36 million to 0·44 million) died from asthma, 
a decrease of 26·7% (–7·2 to 43·7) from 1990, and the age-standardised death rate decreased by 58·8% (39·0 to 69·0). 
The prevalence of asthma increased by 12·6% (9·0 to 16·4), whereas the age-standardised prevalence decreased by 17·7% 
(15·1 to 19·9). Age-standardised DALY rates due to COPD increased until the middle range of the SDI before reducing 
sharply. Age-standardised DALY rates due to asthma in both sexes decreased monotonically with rising SDI. The relation 
between with SDI and DALY rates due to asthma was attributed to variation in years of life lost (YLLs), whereas DALY 
rates due to COPD varied similarly for YLLs and years lived with disability across the SDI continuum. Smoking and 
ambient particulate matter were the main risk factors for COPD followed by household air pollution, occupational 
particulates, ozone, and secondhand smoke. Together, these risks explained 73·3% (95% UI 65·8 to 80·1) of DALYs due 
to COPD. Smoking and occupational asthmagens were the only risks quantified for asthma in GBD, accounting for 
16·5% (14·6 to 18·7) of DALYs due to asthma.
Interpretation Asthma was the most prevalent chronic respiratory disease worldwide in 2015, with twice the number of 
cases of COPD. Deaths from COPD were eight times more common than deaths from asthma. In 2015, COPD caused 
2·6% of global DALYs and asthma 1·1% of global DALYs. Although there are laudable international collaborative efforts 
to make surveys of asthma and COPD more comparable, no consensus exists on case definitions and how to measure 
disease severity for population health measurements like GBD. Comparisons between countries and over time are 
important, as much of the chronic respiratory burden is either preventable or treatable with affordable interventions.

Introduction
Chronic respiratory diseases are among the leading 
causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Of all 
chronic 
respiratory 
diseases, 
chronic 
obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma are the most 
common. These diseases ranked among the top 
20 conditions causing disability globally and were ranked 
eighth (COPD) and 23rd (asthma) as causes of disease 
burden as measured by disability-adjusted life years 
(DALYs) in 2015.1,2 Yet the measurement of mortality, 
prevalence, and other population indicators of these two 
diseases is complicated by misclassification and an 
absence of consensus about case definitions. Both death 
rates and prevalence of COPD steeply increase with age. 
The age pattern of asthma mortality resembles that of 
COPD rather than the relatively steady prevalence in adults 
seen in asthma surveys and health service encounter data. 
This difference in age patterns between cause of death and 
prevalence data sources has been attributed to a range of 
factors including the commonly reported misclassification 
of asthma in the elderly as COPD, variable and temporal 
effects of smoking, and an actual overlap of asthma and 
COPD (asthma COPD overlap; ACO).3,4 However, no 
consensus exists on the definition of ACO to date.5 Also, 
evidence from a longitudinal study6 did not show a larger 
reduction in lung function in those patients with COPD 
and asthma than those without asthma, whereas others 
have challenged the concept of ACO altogether.7,8
Spirometry is the fundamental tool used to define 
and stage COPD and, accordingly, establish population 
prevalence in surveys. Under the umbrella of the burden 
of obstructive lung disease (BOLD) initiative, surveys have 
been done in 29 countries, with surveys in a further 
nine countries still in progress.9 Two previous initiatives in 
five Colombian cities (PREPOCOL)10 and in five Latin 
American capital cities (PLATINO)11 provided more 
population estimates. Although all these studies used 
comparable methods, there is still no universal consensus 
about the thresholds of spirometry findings to define 
COPD.12,13 The two dominant case definitions for airflow 
limitation compatible with COPD are a value of less 
than 0·70 for the ratio of FEV1 and forced vital capacity 
(FVC), or the lower limit of normal (LLN) method of 
deriving a threshold as the fifth percentile of FEV1:FVC in 
a healthy reference population.14 No universal LLN 
threshold exists because it is thought to vary between 
populations.15 Because most people identified with COPD 
based on spirometry findings report not having been 
diagnosed prior to survey, population screening and case-
finding in symptomatic smokers have been suggested to 
provide an opportunity for smoking cessation interventions 
before the disease has progressed.16,17
Most surveys of asthma use a case definition based on 
self-report of a diagnosis of asthma by a physician and 
wheeze (with other respiratory symptoms) in the past 
12 months.18 Others have suggested that wheezing 
symptoms in the past year and bronchial hyper-
responsiveness to inhalation of methacholine or histamine 
that is reversible with a bronchodilator is a better case 
definition for clinically relevant asthma.19 This case 
definition has been used to measure asthma prevalence in 
a few surveys, but has not been universally adopted, partly 
for logistical reasons, but also because of concern about 
poor specificity and poor prediction of future risk of 
asthma in individuals without symptoms.20 However, the 
use of biological measurements to improve the validity of 
the asthma definition depends on the aim of the study. For 
instance, bronchial hyper-responsiveness has similar or 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma have 
been identified as important contributors to fatal and non-fatal 
disease burden in all iterations of the Global Burden of Disease 
study (GBD). Since the 1990s, two landmark epidemiological 
studies in asthma, the International Study of Asthma and 
Allergies in Childhood and the European Community Respiratory 
Health Survey, provided comparable evidence of the asthma 
prevalence in children and adults, respectively, but in a limited 
number of countries. Similarly, for COPD, international initiatives 
such as PREPOCOL, PLATINO, BOLD, IBERPOC, and EPI-SCAN 
used standardised population spirometry to quantify COPD and 
its severity. An absence of consensus on case definitions and 
other sources of measurement bias between data sources 
complicates their estimations.
Added value of this study
In this study, we provide details on the methods used in GBD to 
minimise measurement error introduced by heterogeneous 
cause of death and prevalence data on COPD and asthma. 
We also provide an analysis of how sociodemographic 
development has a different effect on the burden of COPD and 
asthma. We show that mortality but not prevalence of asthma 
is strongly related to sociodemographic development. For 
COPD, the burden increases from low sociodemographic 
development to the mid-range of our Socio-demographic Index 
and decreases with increasing development, most likely 
through the pathways of exposure to smoking and 
environmental risks. We also present risk factor estimates and 
discuss potential new risks that can be added in future GBD 
iterations.
Implications of all the available evidence
COPD and asthma are important contributors to the burden of 
non-communicable diseases. Although much of the burden is 
either preventable or treatable with affordable interventions, 
these diseases have received less attention than other 
non-communicable diseases. Up-to-date population 
information on these diseases is key to policy making to improve 
access to and quality of existing intervention strategies.

better specificity, but much worse sensitivity, than 
symptom questionnaires, making it a less suitable method 
for the measurement of prevalence.21,22
Misclassification and varying case definitions are 
commonly encountered in population health measure-
ment.2 A key component of the Global Burden of Disease 
(GBD) analyses is to identify and correct for such sources 
of measurement bias.
In this Article, we present the results of estimating 
mortality, prevalence, and disease burden in DALYs and 
years lived with disability (YLDs) for COPD and asthma 
from the GBD 2015 study. We also report on the attribution 
of risk factors for these diseases and the relation between 
disease burden and the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), 
a compound measure of income, years of education, and 
total fertility rate.
Methods
Mortality
The methods of the GBD 2015 study have been extensively 
reported elsewhere.1,2,23 Briefly, deaths, incidence, preva-
lence, and DALY rates were estimated for 310 diseases and 
injuries for 195 countries and territories by age group and 
sex from 1990 to 2015. All-cause mortality was derived 
from vital registration systems, censuses, and surveys, and 
analysed with demographic methods to correct for 
incompleteness. Causes of death, derived from an 
extensive database of vital registration and verbal autopsy 
data, were analysed using GBD’s Cause Of Death 
Ensemble modeling (CODEm) tool to calculate mixed 
effects or spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression 
models of rates or cause fractions with varying 
combinations of predictive covariates. Predictive validity 
testing determined the optimal ensemble of models. 
Covariates included smoking prevalence, cigarettes per 
capita, the proportion of the population exposed to 
household air pollution, mean exposure to ambient 
particulate matter (defined as the population-weighted 
annual average mass concentration of particles with a 
diameter less than 2·5 μm [PM2·5] in a m³ of air) from 
outdoor air pollution, a scalar of the combined exposure to 
risks for COPD (and asthma), and SDI. Because the 
sensitivity of verbal autopsy algorithms to detect specific 
chronic respiratory diseases is poor, we only modelled data 
on deaths from all chronic respiratory diseases in CODEm 
and constrained the estimates for specific chronic 
respiratory diseases to the estimates for all chronic 
respiratory deaths. We constrained estimates for all 
individual causes to the all-cause mortality rates derived 
from demographic estimation.
Non-fatal estimation for COPD
Non-fatal estimates for COPD were based on systematic 
reviews of published papers, unpublished reports, surveys 
available in GBD’s Global Health Data Exchange 
repository, and health service encounter data from the 
USA (coded in International Classification of Diseases 
[ICD]-9 to 490–492, 494, and 496). We used 7301 prevalence 
datapoints and 22 incidence datapoints covering 15 of 
21 GBD world regions. No data were available for 
Andean Latin America, the Caribbean, central Asia, central 
and east sub-Saharan Africa, and Oceania. We used the 
Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary 
Disease (GOLD) spirometry-based definition for COPD 
(a ratio of FEV1:FVC <0·70 after bronchodilation)14 and 
modelled overall prevalence and the proportions in COPD 
spirometry stages mild (FEV1 ≥80% of normal), moderate 
(FEV1 50–79% of normal), and severe or very severe 
combined (FEV1 <50% of normal) in DisMod-MR 2.1, 
a Bayesian meta-regression tool. DisMod-MR 2.1 takes all 
available data on prevalence, incidence, remission (defined 
in GBD as the cure rate), and cause of death rates jointly 
into account and forces a consistent set of estimates for 
each parameter. Before entering data into DisMod-MR 2.1, 
we adjusted survey data using different spirometry case 
definitions. We adjusted datapoints from 14 studies 
reporting on the GOLD case definition without a 
bronchodilator after fitting an exponential curve to age-
specific ratios of both measurements from three studies.24–26 
Using a similar approach, we adjusted datapoints from 
six studies reporting LLN pre-bronchodilator data based on 
one study,24 three studies with LLN post-bronchodilator 
data based on five studies,12,24,27–29 and two studies using an 
older version of LLN by the European Respiratory Society 
based on two studies.30,31 We used the meta-regression 
component of DisMod-MR 2.1 to determine an adjustment 
factor for data based on physician diagnosis and the US 
health service encounter data. We included a scalar for the 
combined exposure to all risks estimated for COPD as a 
predictive covariate. We included corresponding datapoints 
for excess mortality rate estimated as the ratio of cause-
specific mortality rate and prevalence corresponding to the 
same year and age range of the datapoint. We used lag-
distributed income per capita as a predictive covariate for 
excess mortality, forcing a negative coefficient on the 
assumption that case fatality decreases with increasing 
wealth in a country. Prevalence by GOLD class was 
available from only 24 countries in 14 GBD world regions.
The proportions of people in GOLD classes I, II, and III 
or IV were modelled separately in DisMod-MR 2.1 and 
then scaled to a sum of 1 and multiplied by the overall 
prevalence of COPD. In GBD, severity of COPD is 
classified into health states (appendix p 4). To map the 
prevalence by GOLD class into health states representing 
symptoms, we used the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey 
(MEPS) data32 for 2001–11 from the USA. MEPS is an 
ongoing data collection project with new panels recruited 
every 2 years. Respondents report on all health service 
contacts and the reasons for those contacts. We identified 
individuals with an ICD-9 diagnosis of COPD. We 
translated scores from a generic quality-of-life instrument, 
the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12),33 into GBD 
disability weight values based on convenience samples of 
research fellows at the Institute for Health Metrics and

Evaluation and annual GBD workshop participants filling 
in SF-12 for a selection of 60 of the 235 health states used 
in GBD 2015. Health states were presented as lay 
descriptions that had been the basis of the pairwise 
comparisons presented to respondents to the GBD 
disability weight surveys. After controlling for comorbidity, 
we assigned a specific disability weight to each individual 
with a diagnosis of COPD. We categorised cases into 
asymptomatic (disability weight value of 0), mild COPD 
(disability weight value between 0 and the midpoint of 
GBD disability weights for mild and moderate COPD), 
moderate COPD (disability weight value greater than the 
midpoint between mild and moderate and midpoint 
between moderate and severe COPD disability weights), 
and severe COPD (the remainder). We took the prevalence 
estimates for the USA in 2005 (at the mid 
point of MEPS 
data range) and mapped the distribution of cases by GOLD 
classes into the distribution of severity from MEPS 
(appendix p 5). This gave us a mapping from GOLD class 
into GBD health states, which could then be applied to the 
prevalence data by GOLD class from all other countries 
and time periods.
Non-fatal estimation for asthma
The main data sources for asthma were population surveys 
and US health service encounter data on the diagnoses for 
any health service contact for 42 million people. We used 
9219 prevalence, 29 incidence, and 32 remission datapoints 
and population death rates from asthma estimated in 
CODEm and scaled to total death rates with all other cause-
specific estimates. Data on prevalence were available for 
121 countries covering all 21 GBD world regions. Our 
case definition for asthma was a reported diagnosis by 
a physician, with wheezing in the past 12 months. In 
DisMod-MR 2.1, we adjusted data based on reported 
wheezing only and US health service encounter data, and 
used a scalar of the combined exposure to risk factors for 
asthma. Similar to the COPD model, we added excess 
mortality rates corresponding to all prevalence datapoints 
with lag-distributed income per capita as a predictive 
covariate. The health states and disability weights for 
three asthma health states are listed in the appendix (p 4). 
The distribution between the three asthma health states 
and an asymptomatic health state was analysed in MEPS. 
In the absence of comparable epidemiological severity 
distribution data, a simplifying assumption had to be 
made that the US distribution of severity for asthma can be 
generalised to all countries. Additional details on the 
estimation process for COPD and asthma can be found in 
the appendix (pp 15–28).
Risk estimation
Estimates were made of six risk factors for COPD 
(smoking, second-hand smoke, household air pollution, 
ambient particulate matter, ozone, and occupational 
particulates) and two risk factors for asthma (smoking and 
occupational asthmagens). Sufficient evidence of causality, 
availability of exposure data, potential for modification, 
and policy interest are criteria for choosing risks and 
associated outcomes in GBD. Population-attributable 
fractions of disease outcomes were estimated from 
exposure data, relative risks of outcomes, and a theoretical 
minimum level of exposure. Population surveys were the 
main source of exposure data on smoking, second-hand 
smoke, and household air pollution. Exposure to PM2·5 was 
measured from satellite data on aerosols in the atmosphere 
and calibrated to observations from ground monitors. We 
based exposure to ozone on a chemical transport model of 
satellite data.34 Occupational exposures were based on the 
proportion of the working population exposed to 
asthmagens and particulates based on distribution of the 
population in nine occupational groups as reported by the 
International Labor Organization.35 We derived relative 
risks from meta-analyses of cohort studies. The theoretical 
minimum exposure level was set as zero for smoking, 
second-hand smoke, and the occupational exposures. For 
household air pollution, the minimum was defined as no 
household reporting use of solid fuel for cooking. For 
ambient particulate matter, the minimum was set as a 
uniform distribution between the lowest and fifth 
percentile exposure level from all data sources. For ozone, 
the minimum was set as a uniform distribution between 
the lowest and fifth percentile exposure measured in the 
American Cancer Society’s Cancer Prevention Study II.36 
Unlike disease estimates that are mutually exclusive and 
collectively exhaustive in GBD, risk estimates are based on 
a counterfactual analysis (what if past exposure to a risk 
had been at the theoretical minimum level?) and are, 
therefore, not additive. Estimates of combinations of risks 
take mediation into account based on the difference in 
relative risks from cohort and trial data that did and did not 
control for another risk as a confounder. After adjustment 
for mediation, risks were combined using a multiplicative 
function to avoid the sum of risks exceeding the total 
amount of disease.23 Additional details on the estimation 
process for COPD and asthma risks can be found in the 
appendix (pp 29–57).
DALY estimation
We calculated years of life lost (YLLs) by multiplying 
the number of deaths for a cause by the remaining 
life expectancy in GBD’s standard life table based 
on the lowest observed mortality rates at each age in 
any population over 5 million.1 We calculated YLDs by 
multiplying the prevalence of each sequela by the 
disability weight that quantifies the relative severity of the 
sequela on a scale between 0 and 1. We derived disability 
weights from nine population surveys and an open-access 
internet survey using pairwise comparison methods.37 
DALYs are the sum of YLLs and YLDs. We estimated 
uncertainty by recalculating every outcome of interest 
1000 times, drawing from distributions of the sampling 
error around input data, corrections for measurement 
error, and estimates of residual non-sampling error and,

in the case of cause of death estimates, model selection. 
Uncertainty intervals (UIs) were defined as the 25th and 
975th values of the posterior distributions. We computed 
differences between estimates at the 1000-draw level and 
reported them as significant if more than 95% of values 
for the difference were either positive or negative. We 
computed age-standardised rates using the GBD standard 
population.1
SDI is an index of sociodemographic development 
consisting of lagged distributed income per capita, mean 
years of education over the age of 15 years, and total fertility 
rate.1 Each component was given equal weight and rescaled 
from 0 (for the lowest value observed during 1980–2015) to 
1 (for the highest value observed) for income per capita and 
average years of schooling, and the reverse for the total 
fertility rate. The final SDI score was computed as the 
geometric mean of each of the components. We classified 
countries into five quintiles based on the entire distribution 
of location-year combinations between 1980 and 2015. We 
present results on each country’s position based on its 
2015 SDI value. A LOESS regression on all data from 1980 
to 2015 was done to define the expected relationship 
between SDI and each health outcome. We contrast 
observed disease rates against this expected level to identify 
world regions performing better or worse than expected 
based on their development status.

Results
In 2015, 3·2 million people (95% UI 3·1 million to 
3·3 million) died from COPD worldwide, an increase of 
11·6% (5·3–19·8) compared with 1990, despite a 
decrease in the age-standardised death rate of 41·9% 
(37·7–45·1). Population growth and ageing of the global 
population outweighed the downward trend in age-
standardised death rates. The greatest reduction in age-
standardised death rates occurred in countries in the 
high-middle-SDI quintile and middle-SDI quintile. 
From 1990 to 2015, the prevalence of COPD increased 
by 44·2% (95% UI 41·7–46·6) to 174·5 million 
individuals (160·2 million to 189·0 million). The 
decrease in age-standardised prevalence of 14·7% 
(13·5–15·9) was much smaller than the decrease in age-
standardised death rates. The greatest decrease in age-
standardised prevalence was seen in countries in the 
high-middle-SDI quintile and the middle-SDI quintile 
(table 1).
In 2015, 0·40 million people (95% UI 0·36 million to 
0·44 million) died from asthma, a decrease of 26·7% 
(–7·2 to 43·7) compared with 1990. The decrease in 
age-standardised death rates was 58·8% (39·0–69·0) 
between 1990 and 2015. The greatest reduction in 
age-standardised death rates occurred in countries in the 
high-SDI and low-middle-SDI quintiles. From 1990 
to 2015, the prevalence of asthma increased by 12·6% 
(9·0–16·4) to 358·2 million individuals (323·1 million to 
393·5 million). The decrease in age-standardised 
prevalence by 17·7% (15·1–19·9) was smaller than the

Data in parentheses are 95% uncertainty intervals. SDI is calculated for each location (all 188 countries, seven territories, and 519 subnational locations estimated in GBD 2015) as a function of lag-distributed 
income per capita, average educational attainment in the population aged over 15 years, and the total fertility rate. SDI of 0 represents the lowest level of income per capita, educational attainment, and highest 
total fertility rate observed from 1980 to 2015, and SDI of 1 represents the highest income per capita, educational attainment, and lowest total fertility rate with an effect on health over the same period. Cutoffs 
on the SDI scale for the quintiles have been selected based on their 2015 values by location. COPD=chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. SDI=Socio-demographic Index.

overall decrease in age-standardised death rates. The 
age-standardised death rate for asthma in 2015 was higher 
in males (6·7 [5·9–7·5] per 100 000 people) than in females 
(5·6 [4·8–6·4] per 100 000 people). A greater reduction in 
age-standardised prevalence was seen in countries in the 
high-SDI and low-middle-SDI quintiles (table 1).
Globally, COPD affected 104·7 million males (95% UI 
96·0 million to 113·8 million) and 69·7 million females 
(64·2 million to 75·4 million) in 2015. Age-standardised 
prevalence was 3·2% (2·9–3·5) in males and 2·0% 
(1·8–2·1) in females. Age-standardised DALY rates in 
males (1273·0 [95% UI 1215·5–1328·3] per 100 000 people) 
were almost twice as high as those in females (717·4 
[677·7–759·3] per 100 000 people) reflecting a higher male-
to-female ratio for deaths than for prevalence. Conversely, 
age-standardised DALY rates due to asthma were similar 
between male individuals (365 [290–451] per 100 000 people) 
and female individuals (368 [286–461] per 100 000 people). 
In 2015, more females (190·2 million [172·2 million to 
208·9 million]) than males (168·0 million [150·8 million to 
185·1 million]) had asthma; a reversal of the higher male-
to-female ratio during adolescence.
YLLs contributed more than 80% of DALYs due to 
COPD. Conversely, asthma is highly prevalent at all ages 
and leads to fewer deaths than COPD and thus YLDs 
formed the larger component of DALYs, at just over 60%. 
The 63·9 million DALYs (95% UI 61·2 million to 
66·3 million) due to COPD represented 2·6% (95% UI 
2·4–2·8) of the entire global burden of disease in 2015. 
26·2 million DALYs (20·5 million to 32·6 million) due to 
asthma contributed 1·1% (0·9–1·3) of the total burden 
in 2015 (table 2). The greatest decrease in age-standardised 
DALY rates due to COPD occurred in countries in the 
high-middle-SDI and middle-SDI quintiles. The biggest 
reduction in age-standardised asthma DALY rates occurred 
in the low-middle-SDI quintile (table 2).
Age-standardised DALY rates due to COPD in 2015 were 
estimated to exceed 2000 per 100 000 people in Papua New 
Guinea, India, Lesotho, and Nepal. Rates below 300 per 
100 000 people were seen in some countries in high-income 
Asia Pacific, central Europe, north Africa and Middle East, 
the Caribbean, western Europe, and Andean Latin America 
(figure 1). Age-standardised asthma DALY rates in excess of 
1200 per 100 000 people were estimated for Afghanistan, 
Central African Republic, Fiji, Kiribati, Lesotho, Papua New 
Guinea, and Swaziland. Countries in eastern and central 
Europe, China, Italy, and Japan had asthma DALY rates 
between 100 and 200 per 100 000 people (figure 2). DALY 
estimates for COPD and asthma by country and the 
percentage change in DALYs and age-standardised DALY 
rates between 1990 and 2015 are presented in the appendix 
(p 61–67).

Examining the expected relationship between SDI and 
all-age DALY rates showed a reduction in asthma rates 
with increasing SDI in both sexes, whereas DALY rates 
due to COPD increased up until around 0·5 SDI, decreased 
to the lowest values at an SDI value of 0·75, after which 
they slightly increased (figure 3). These patterns reflect 
a combined effect of population growth, ageing, and 
variation in prevalence. The change in age-standardised 
DALY rates with SDI shows an increase in DALY rates due 
to COPD until the middle range of SDI values and then a 
sharp decline. DALY rates due to asthma in both sexes 
decreased monotonically with rising SDI (figure 4). The 
relationship between DALY rates due to asthma and SDI 
largely reflected variation in YLLs, whereas DALY rates 
due to COPD varied similarly for YLLs and YLDs across 
the SDI continuum (figure 5).
The GBD regions of Oceania, east Asia, south Asia, and 
high-income North America had higher age-standardised 
DALY rates due to COPD in both sexes than expected based 
on their SDI. Male individuals in eastern Europe also had 
higher than expected DALY rates. Regions with better-than-
expected COPD DALY rates included eastern, central, and 
western sub-Saharan Africa; central and Andean Latin 
America and the Caribbean; and north Africa and the 
Middle East (figure 6). Age-standardised DALY rates due to 
asthma in Oceania were much higher than expected based 
on SDI. Australasia, southeast Asia, the Caribbean, and 
southern sub-Saharan Africa also had higher DALY rates 
than expected. The asthma DALY rates in south Asia were 
higher than expected in 1990 (when SDI was lowest), but 
converged with expected values in 2015. Central Europe, 
east Asia, and western and eastern sub-Saharan Africa had 
lower than expected asthma DALY rates (figure 7).
Smoking and ambient particulate matter were the main 
risks for COPD followed by household air pollution, 
occupational particulates, ozone, and second-hand smoke 
(figure 8). Together, these risks explained 73·3% (95% UI

65·8–80·1) of DALYs due to COPD. Smoking and 
occupational asthmagens were the only risks quantified 
for asthma in GBD, explaining just 16·5% (14·6–18·7) of 
the asthma DALYs. The contribution of risks to the burden 
of COPD varied by SDI quintiles. In high-SDI countries, 
the behavioural risks (smoking and second-hand smoke) 
were the most important, whereas environmental risks 
and, to a lesser extent, occupational risks explained most of 
the burden in lower-SDI quintiles. The proportions of 
COPD burden not explained by any of the GBD risks 
showed little variation between SDI quintiles (figure 9, 
table 3).

Discussion
Asthma was the most prevalent chronic respiratory 
disease, affecting an estimated 358 million people in 2015. 
COPD was half as common, with 174 million people 
affected in 2015. Deaths from COPD were eight times 
more common than deaths from asthma. YLLs contributed 
81·2% of the 63·8 million global DALYs due to COPD, 
whereas YLDs represented the largest proportion of the 
26·2 million global DALYs due to asthma. COPD ranked 
eighth (2·6% of global DALYs) and asthma 23rd (1·1% of 
global DALYs) among the 315 GBD causes in 2015. Age-
standardised DALY rates from COPD and asthma declined 
significantly by 43·7% (39·8–47·0) for COPD and by 
42·8% (29·5–52·0) for asthma between 1990 and 2015. 
Most of the reductions have come from a reduction in 
mortality, by 41·9% for COPD and 58·8% for asthma. The 
reductions in YLDs have been much smaller. This finding 
reflects greater improvements in reducing case fatality 
rather than a change in incidence and prevalence. The 
absence of a relationship between asthma prevalence and 
asthma death rates, and our knowledge about asthma 
pathophysiology and clinical trial findings, add evidence 
that most asthma deaths at all ages are preventable by 
treatment with low-dose inhaled corticosteroids and other

management strategies or, to a lesser extent, avoidance of 
risk factors. Indeed, the observed low asthma mortality in 
high-income countries reflects better access to health 
services 
and 
better 
treatment 
options 
following 
international asthma guidance.39 This fact is reflected by a 
strong relationship between SDI and mortality, but not 
prevalence of asthma. The relationship between SDI and 
COPD is less monotonic. Higher COPD death rates and 
prevalence at the middle range of SDI values reflect the 
increase in smoking and outdoor air pollution observed 
in countries going through the demographic and 
epidemiological transition.
Between the GBD 2013 and GBD 2015 iterations, 
a methodological change led to a significant difference in 
prevalence and YLDs due to COPD. In the GBD 2013 
study, we estimated 328·5 million prevalent cases and 
26·1 million YLDs for the year 2013, whereas the GBD 
2015 estimates for 2015 were 174·5 cases and 12·0 million 
YLDs. This difference is due to a shift from taking LLN 
estimates as the reference case definition to using the 
fixed-ratio definition of GOLD. This change in the methods 
led to much lower prevalence estimates in 2015 than in 
2013 because the GOLD criteria identified lower prevalence 
in younger adults than older adults. Younger adults 
represent a much larger proportion of the world’s 
population, and therefore a higher estimate of prevalence 
at these ages affects the total prevalence more than an

equivalent change in the prevalence at older ages. The 
main motivation to revert to the fixed-ratio GOLD 
definition for GBD 2015 was that we aimed to estimate 
symptomatic disease. Our severity distributions are 
derived from epidemiological data on GOLD classes, 
which fit better with the estimation of prevalence based on 
GOLD’s fixed ratio criteria than LLN. Most of the 
arguments for using an LLN case definition are based on 
future risk of disease to identify people with early signs of 
disease, who could be prevented from developing 
symptomatic disease by measures such as smoking 
cessation. Both in primary and secondary care, clinicians 
rely on respiratory symptoms, exposure to major known 
risks, and airflow limitation to diagnose COPD clinically. 
Accurate LLN estimation requires prediction reference 
equations, and to date there are no universal prediction 
equations for LLN because spirometry is not only variable 
by age and sex, but is also race-related and affected by 
different local environments.15,40 To date, the fixed ratio has 
gained more popular use in clinical practice because it is 
easy to calculate, thus helping to remove barriers to the 
widespread use of spirometry and diagnosis of fixed 
airflow obstruction. Furthermore, nearly all evidence on 
efficacy and safety of respiratory drugs and other 
treatments comes from randomised trials with patients 
identified using a fixed ratio definition.41
No comparable estimates of the global prevalence of 
COPD exist other than those made for previous iterations 
of GBD. A decade ago, findings from a meta-analysis42 of 
COPD prevalence studies showed large heterogeneity 
depending on case definitions based on spirometry, 
physician diagnosis, symptoms, and radiology. No 
attempt was made to pool estimates between different 
study methods and diagnostic thresholds. The various 
initiatives (BOLD, PLATINO, EPISCAN, and PREPOCOL) 
for population-representative COPD spirometry surveys 
have been combined for pooled analyses to compare 
prevalence estimates between sites, but estimation of 
global prevalence has not been attempted.16
An estimate of 300 million prevalence cases of asthma 
was made in 2004 as part of the Global Initiative for 
Asthma (GINA) based on the International Study of 
Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) and European 
Community Respiratory Health Survey (ECRHS) estimates 
of wheezing prevalence and an arbitrary 50% reduction of 
these estimates for clinical asthma.43 This estimate is a 
lower than our estimate of 329 million prevalent cases 
in 2000, and 327 million cases in 2005, and our current 
2015 estimate of 358 million cases. A comparison between 
the ISAAC study estimates in children and the ECRHS 
study in adults showed a high correlation between 
childhood and adult prevalence estimates within countries, 
but large variation between countries.18 In an analysis of 
the World Health Surveys done in the early 2000s in 
70 countries,44 estimates of the prevalence of wheeze, 
reported physician diagnosis, and clinical asthma (based 
on questions of a physician diagnosis and ever having 
been treated for asthma or currently using asthma 
medication) were pooled. This showed a difference of 
around two times between higher estimates for wheeze 
compared with a reported physician diagnosis, whereas 
prevalence of clinical asthma was only marginally higher 
than for physician diagnosis. However, the pooling method 
in this study was not explained.44 ISAAC Phase Three was 
completed in 233 centres in 97 countries (80% low-income 
and middle-income countries), and ISAAC repeated 
surveys of prevalence of asthma have been done in 
106 centres in 56 countries to date. We have made use of all 
publicly available survey results from ISAAC and ECRHS.
We estimated the highest age-standardised DALY rates 
due to COPD in 2015 in Papua New Guinea, India, 
Lesotho, and Nepal. Findings from three verbal autopsy 
studies in the 1980s in Papua New Guinea showed high 
chronic respiratory disease mortality. We decided to retain 
these three studies as they provide the only data on causes 
of death for this country; there were no reasons to exclude 
them based on an assessment of their quality. The high

rates of mortality and morbidity in Lesotho and Nepal 
were based on predictive covariates as we do not have 
primary data for COPD from these two countries. The 
high rates in India were driven by mortality data sources 
and two small spirometry studies in Pune and Mumbai.45
Our knowledge of the natural history of COPD and 
asthma is extensive yet incomplete. For asthma, over 
100 cohorts focusing on asthma and allergy have been 
initiated worldwide over the past 30 years.46 These long-
term birth cohort studies are essential to understanding 
the life course and childhood predictors of asthma and 
allergy and the complex interplay between genes and 
the environment (including lifestyle and socioeconomic 
determinants). However, information to quantify 
population-level exposure to allergens in a comparable 
manner is incomplete, and it has therefore not been 
possible to add it as a risk in GBD. Such natural history 
evidence is mostly missing for COPD.47
The contribution of modifiable risk factors to COPD is 
large, yet much less for asthma. There are preventive 
interventions to reduce exposure to smoking, second-hand 
smoke, air pollution, biomass for cooking or heating, 
occupational exposures, or any combination of these 
factors. Additionally, other risk factors have been identified 
such as parental or sibling history of asthma and atopy, low 
birthweight, lower respiratory infections in childhood, 
education, day care, pet ownership, and other exposures, 
among others suggested. However, we are still far from 
eliminating these as major contributors to the burden 
of COPD. Smoking is the largest contributor to the 
COPD burden in countries at the higher end of the 
SDI (69·4% of COPD burden in high-SDI quintile 
countries), whereas the proportion of COPD explained by 
environmental exposures is highest in countries with low 
SDI (58·1% of COPD burden in low-SDI quintile 
countries). Given the importance of smoking as a risk 
factor of disease, monitoring national and international 
trends and projections in smoking remains paramount for 
worldwide health surveillance.48,49 Smoking prevalence has 
decreased in men and women since 1990 worldwide, but 
progress in tobacco control has not been universal.50 
Globally, exposure to household air pollution from solid 
fuels has decreased since 1990, but exposure to ambient air 
pollution has increased since 1990.23
However, a considerable proportion of COPD remains 
unexplained and cannot be attributed to the risks 
quantified in GBD. In the next iteration of GBD, we plan 
to quantify a past history of pulmonary tuberculosis as an 
additional risk factor for COPD as there is growing 
evidence for a causal relationship.51,52 We did not estimate 
air pollution as a risk for asthma, because we had 
insufficient evidence for an increased risk of disease. 
Repeated lower respiratory infections in childhood and 
the long-term effects of asthma have been reported as 
other explanatory factors, but it is not quite apparent how 
estimation of these effects can be operationalised in 
GBD.53,54 In future GBD iterations, ambient and household 
air pollution will be re-evaluated as risk factors for 
asthma.55,56
Other newly established individual risk factors of COPD, 
such as low level of physical activity, could also have 
contributed to the unexplained COPD burden, as it has 
been related both to an increased risk of COPD among 
smokers57 and to a higher risk of COPD mortality.58
We estimate only a small proportion of asthma burden 
due to risks quantified in GBD: 10·1% from occupational 
asthmagens and 7·8% due to smoking.59,60 Evidence from 
long-term observational studies and birth cohorts have 
rendered three hypotheses on other causes and triggers of 
asthma, namely the hygiene, westernisation, and obesity 
or sedentarism hypotheses. Comparative studies61,62 of 
rural and urban populations gave rise to the hygiene theory 
that exposure to infections in early childhood explains 
the lower prevalence of asthma in rural areas. The 
second theory is that socioeconomic development or 
westernisation predisposes to the development of asthma, 
but it is not clear which pathways other than those 
described in the hygiene theory have a role.63 Obesity has 
been linked to a higher prevalence of asthma in children64 
and an increased risk of developing new asthma in adults.65
As concluded by Fuchs and colleagues in their 
2017 Review,66 we need to better understand underlying 
mechanisms of associations of asthma onset or remission 
with risk and protective factors, and future asthma 
research should integrate both paediatric and adult 
populations and longitudinal studies.
The general limitations of GBD studies have been 
reported elsewhere and apply to estimates of obstructive 
airways disease as well,1,2,23 and there are a number of 
limitations specific to COPD and asthma. The first 
concerns the poor consensus on a case definition of 
COPD. There was a difference of more than two times in 
YLDs between the GBD 2013 study, which used LLN as its 
case definition, and the current study’s YLD results based 
on the fixed ratio of the GOLD definition. As the survey 
data on GOLD class distributions is largely based on a 
fixed ratio estimate of overall prevalence, we advocate that 
for GBD estimation purposes, use of the fixed ratio is 
preferable. Additionally, defining the cutoff value for LLN 
as the fifth percentile in a healthy reference population 
makes the arbitrary assumption that prevalence cannot be 
lower than 5%.
Second, to make use of all spirometry surveys that 
reported COPD prevalence using different thresholds, 
and with or without bronchodilation, we had to adjust data 
sources to the expected values of our reference case 
definition. We used a limited set of surveys that presented 
data with the reference and alternative case definitions. 
Each of those adjustments showed a strong age pattern, 
which we tried to capture with regression methods. Such 
adjustments add uncertainty, which would be avoided if 
estimates were all reported in a standard manner.
Third, because no physiological measurement is 
considered a gold standard, diagnosis of asthma relies on

703
clinical assessment and self-report, a physician diagnosis, 
or both. Thus, measurement of asthma prevalence can be 
affected by the limitations of recall bias, access to health 
services, and different interpretations of survey questions 
inherent in self-reported health measurements.67 Access 
to clinical care is a challenge in low-income and middle-
income countries, as well as in rural settings, therefore, 
defining asthma by reported symptoms and a doctor 
diagnosis could lead to an underestimate of asthma 
prevalence. We refined our assessment of asthma studies 
in GBD 2015 to better deal with nuances in self-report 
measures and adjusted for three instead of just one non-
reference case definition. However, we cannot exclude 
that some residual measurement bias has affected the 
comparability of estimates between countries.
Fourth, mapping severity in MEPS to COPD GOLD class 
prevalence assumes this relationship can be generalised 
from the USA to the rest of the world. However, we only 
use the relationship between epidemiological data on 
GOLD class distributions in the USA to the severity pattern 
of cases with COPD in MEPS as reflected in respondents’ 
answers to the SF-12. Our epidemiological models of the 
GOLD class distribution allow us to differentiate severity 
by age, sex, year, and location in as far as the sparse 
information on GOLD class prevalence allows. Our 
measurements of COPD severity would benefit from 
increased use standardised measures in surveys that 
reflect the lay descriptions on which the GBD disability 
weights are based or that use a generic quality-of-life 
measure like SF-12.
Fifth, our measurement of asthma severity completely 
relies on MEPS data and therefore, unlike COPD, assumes 
the same distribution for every location, year, age, and sex. 
This assumption is highly unlikely as treatments have a 
large effect on severity of asthma. For this reason, we 
found no relationship between SDI and YLDs from 
asthma, counter to the expectation that increased access to 
treatment, particularly steroid inhalers, would impact 
asthma severity and hence disability. Researchers are 
encouraged, in future surveys, to collect information on 
the proportion of cases that would fall into the lay 
description categories for controlled, partially controlled, 
and uncontrolled asthma.
Sixth, for many countries in the world that do not have 
functional vital registration systems, we had to rely on 
death estimates of all chronic respiratory diseases from 
verbal autopsy studies because these studies cannot 
distinguish between asthma, COPD, or other chronic 
respiratory diseases. Initiatives to strengthen vital 
registration systems are key to improving population 
health measurement because verbal autopsy can only 
identify a restricted set of diseases.68
Seventh, the estimate of the global prevalence of asthma 
changed from 242 million in 2013 based on GBD 2013 to 
358 million in 2015 for GBD 2015. In GBD 2015, cause-
specific mortality rates were added to the DisMod-MR 2.1 
model with income per capita as a covariate to differentiate 
excess mortality rates based on a country’s income. This 
addition had little effect on the estimates in high-income 
countries, but increased estimates in low-income and 
middle-income countries considerably. We believe that 
this approach is an improvement in the estimation strategy 
and that future estimates of global prevalence of asthma 
will be more consistent with the GBD 2015 finding.
COPD and asthma are important contributors to the 
burden of non-communicable disease. Although much of 
the burden is either preventable or treatable with affordable 
interventions, these diseases have received less attention 
than other prominent non-communicable diseases like 
cardiovascular disease, cancer, or diabetes. Up-to-date 
population information on these common diseases is key 
to policy decision making to improve access to and quality 
of existing intervention strategies. We call for greater 
standardisation in data collection with regard to case 
definition and severity distributions of all non-
communicable diseases in general, and of asthma and 
COPD in particular. More, and updated, population 
measurements of COPD and asthma are needed to better 
quantify the size of the problem, to benchmark with other 
chronic conditions associated with smoking and ageing, 
and with any other environmental and air pollution 
exposures.
