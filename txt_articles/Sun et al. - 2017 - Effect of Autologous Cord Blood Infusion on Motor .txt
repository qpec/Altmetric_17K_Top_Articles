ABSTRACT
Cerebral palsy (CP) is a condition affecting young children that causes lifelong disabilities. Umbilical
cord blood cells improve motor function in experimental systems via paracrine signaling. After
demonstrating safety, we conducted a phase II trial of autologous cord blood (ACB) infusion in chil-
dren with CP to test whether ACB could improve function (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01147653; IND
14360). In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study of a single intravenous infusion of
1–5 3 107 total nucleated cells per kilogram of ACB, children ages 1 to 6 years with CP were ran-
domly assigned to receive ACB or placebo at baseline, followed by the alternate infusion 1 year
later. Motor function and magnetic resonance imaging brain connectivity studies were performed
at baseline, 1, and 2 years post-treatment. The primary endpoint was change in motor function 1
year after baseline infusion. Additional analyses were performed at 2 years. Sixty-three children
(median age 2.1 years) were randomized to treatment (n 5 32) or placebo (n 5 31) at baseline.
Although there was no difference in mean change in Gross Motor Function Measure-66 (GMFM-
66) scores at 1 year between placebo and treated groups, a dosing effect was identified. In an anal-
ysis 1 year post-ACB treatment, those who received doses �2 3 107/kg demonstrated significantly
greater increases in GMFM-66 scores above those predicted by age and severity, as well as in Pea-
body Developmental Motor Scales-2 Gross Motor Quotient scores and normalized brain connectiv-
ity. Results of this study suggest that appropriately dosed ACB infusion improves brain connectivity
and gross motor function in young children with CP. STEM CELLS TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT
Results of this trial suggest that, when adequately dosed, an intravenous infusion of autologous
umbilical cord blood improves whole brain connectivity and motor function in young children
with cerebral palsy.
INTRODUCTION
Cerebral palsy (CP), the most prevalent motor dis-
order of childhood, affects two to three per 1,000
live births [1]. CP typically results from in utero or
perinatal brain injury such as hypoxic insult, hem-
orrhage, or stroke. Affected children have varying
degrees of functional impairments from mild limi-
tations in advanced motor skills to severely lim-
ited
self-mobility
despite
use
of
assistive
technology resulting in a lifelong inability to func-
tion independently. Currently, the cornerstone of
treatment
is
various
therapies
to
optimize
function and quality of life. However, no curative
therapies are available.
Improved motor function has been demon-
strated in animal models of ischemic brain
injury and CP after administration of human
umbilical cord blood cells [2, 3]. Evidence sug-
gests that cord blood cells act via paracrine
signaling endogenous cells to facilitate repair.
This led us to hypothesize that intravenous
(IV) infusion of autologous cord blood (ACB)
would improve motor function in young chil-
dren with CP. After demonstration of safety in
184 children [4], we conducted a randomized,

 placebo-controlled trial testing the efficacy of a single IV ACB
infusion in young children with CP.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design
We conducted a single-center, phase II, prospective, randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study of a single IV
ACB infusion in children ages 1 to 6 years with CP (Fig. 1) at Duke
University. The study was approved by the Duke Institutional
Review Board and conducted under FDA IND14360.
Participants
Eligible children were 1 to 6 years old had CP with (a) Gross Motor
Classification System (GMFCS) level 2–4 or (b) GMFCS level 1 with
hemiplegia if they used their affected hand as an assist only. Chil-
dren also had to have an eligible ACB unit banked at a public or
private cord blood bank that was sterile, had a precryopreserva-
tion total nucleated cell count (TNCC) �1 3 107/kg, and met crite-
ria in Table 1. Children with genetic conditions, intractable
seizures, hypsarrhythmia, athetoid CP, severe microcephaly,
autism without motor disability, evidence of a progressive neuro-
logic disease or a condition that could require a future allogeneic
stem cell transplant, active infection(s), impaired renal, liver or
respiratory function, or a history of prior cell therapy were ineli-
gible. Written informed consent was obtained from parent(s)/
guardian(s) for patient and ACB screening and study participation.
Randomization and Masking
Patients were randomized to the order in which they received ACB
and placebo infusions, given 1 year apart. Those on the ACB arm
received an infusion of ACB at baseline. Those on the placebo arm
received an infusion of a placebo solution constructed to mimic
the color and smell of the ACB at baseline. The placebo product
consisted of TC-1991 1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Computer-
generated randomization was performed by The Emmes Corpora-
tion in a 1:1 ratio, stratified by age and CP typography. Only staff
preparing the products were aware of the treatment assignment,
and these individuals had no contact with the patients, families,
providers, and examiners who were masked to the assigned treat-
ment. Masking was achieved by covering all infusion bags with a
dark bag in the laboratory and infusing a similar volume as the pla-
cebo product. Cell dose, targeted at 1–5 3 107 cells per kilogram,
was not randomly assigned, but was determined by the number of
cells available in each ACB unit and the patient’s weight.
Procedures
Patients’ medical records and ACB reports were reviewed. If likely
to be eligible, an ACB sample was shipped to Duke for potency

 and viability testing. Unit identity was confirmed by low-
resolution Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-testing of patient and
ACB samples. If specifications were met, the cryopreserved ACB
unit was shipped to Duke and stored under liquid nitrogen until
the day of ACB infusion. Prior to enrollment, all patients were
assessed by an independent examiner (M.A.M., G.W., R.G.) to con-
firm eligibility and assign baseline GMFCS level. On the day of ACB
infusion, the product was thawed and washed in dextran 401 5%
albumin (DA) and placed in 1.25 ml/kg DA for administration [5].
Placebo infusions consisted of TC-1991 1% (DMSO). The cells or
placebo were administered at baseline and 1 year later in a
masked manner through a peripheral IV catheter over 5–15
minutes in the outpatient setting after premedication with oral
acetaminophen (10–15 mg/kg), IV diphenhydramine (0.5 mg/kg),
and IV methylprednisolone (0.5 mg/kg). Subjects received mainte-
nance IV fluids and were monitored for 2–4 hours post-infusion.
Safety endpoints were incidences of infusion reactions and infec-
tions related to the study treatment. Safety assessments were
conducted at 24 hours and 7–10 days after each infusion, as well
as annually during return visits. Participants received traditional
rehabilitation therapies per their local physicians and therapists
throughout the duration of the study.
Motor Assessments
Functional assessments were performed by trained physicians
and therapists at baseline, 1- year, and 2-years. GMFCS level was
assessed and motor evaluations completed, including the Peabody
Developmental Motor Scales-2 (PDMS-2) [6] and GMFM-66 [7], a
66-item measure designed to assess gross motor function in chil-
dren with CP.
Magnetic Resonance Imaging
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed, under moder-
ate sedation for most participants, at baseline, 1-year, and 2-
years. Diffusion weighted images were acquired on a 3 Tesla GE
MR750 scanner (Waukesha, WI) using a 25-direction gradient dif-
fusion encoding scheme (b 5 1,000 seconds/mm2, 3 nondiffusion-
weighted images), 70.5 ms echo time (TE), and 12,000 millisec-
onds repetition time (TR). Isotropic resolution of 2 mm3 was
achieved using a 96 3 96 acquisition matrix in a field of view
(FOV) of 192 3 192 mm2. T1-weighted images were obtained
with an inversion-prepared three-dimensional (3D) fast spoiled-
gradient-recalled (FSPGR) pulse sequence with a 2.5 ms TE, 450
ms inversion time (TI), 6.5 ms TR, and 128 flip angle, at 1 mm3 iso-
tropic resolution.
Whole brain connnectome analysis was based on MRI diffu-
sion weighted images from all directions. Diffusion tensor in every
voxel across the entire brain was derived, and fiber pathways
tracked using fiber assignment by continuous tracking streamline
tracking algorithm [8, 9] based on a standard fractional anisotropy
(FA) threshold (0.2) to limit the pathways within the white matter.
A whole-brain connectome analysis, based on all diffusion tensors,
was then carried out to investigate brain connectivity and
improvement among functional brain regions. These gray matter
regions, termed “nodes” in the brain connectome, were defined
by the JHU-DTI-MNI “Eve” atlas template [10, 11], and warped
into each subject’s DTI image space via the Advanced Normaliza-
tion Tools toolkit [12] for a standardized processing strategy. Con-
nectivity from any given node, or between any pair of nodes, was
first measured by determining volumes of the relevant white mat-
ter fiber pathways projecting from that node or between a pair of
nodes. These volumes were then further normalized by the total
white matter volume (derived from a 3D FSPGR T1 weighted MRI)
to remove the dependence on brain sizes due to developmental
effect.
Statistical Analysis
The primary endpoint was change in motor function from baseline
to 1-year assessed by the GMFM-66. A positive change in GMFM-
66 score is considered an improvement, and minimal clinically
important differences (MCIDs) [13] of medium and large effect
sizes have been established. Sample size planning used estimates
of this change score in untreated patients derived from a litera-
ture review (mean 5 6, SD 5 3) [14, 15]. The study was originally
planned for 60 subjects/group (n5 120 total), estimated to pro-
vide 78%–97% power to detect a clinically relevant increase of
25%–35% in the mean 1-year GMFM-66 change score comparing
ACB to placebo using a two-sided, equal-variance t test and 5%
Type I error rate.
Two unplanned interim analyses were conducted for the pri-
mary endpoint. Efficacy stopping rules were designed to preserve
the overall Type I error rate at 5% using an alpha spending func-
tion, f(t) 5 min(a*t3, a). The null hypothesis of no difference
between treatment groups was not rejected at either analysis. A
simulation study for conditional power conducted after the first
interim analysis suggested potential benefit in continuing the trial.
However, due to slow accrual, the trial was closed when enroll-
ment reached n 5 63. When all subjects had completed the 1-
year assessment and after verifying assumptions, the test of the
primary hypothesis was performed using an equal-variance, two-
sample t test with a critical value of 2.00, which maintained an
overall two-sided cumulative alpha of 0.05 across interim looks
with the final sample size. Results of the interim analyses were
reviewed by the primary investigators. Study personnel conduct-
ing outcome assessments were not informed of the results.
All analyses (performed by B.B., J.T., R.S. using SAS versions
9.3 and 9.4) followed the intention-to-treat principle. The primary
endpoint was compared between ACB and placebo using an
equal-variance t test. Additional analyses, involving comparison of
outcomes by dose between ACB and placebo 1 year after baseline
and among all patients 1 year after treatment with ACB, used the
t test, Wilcoxon rank sum test, Fisher’s exact test, or Spearman
correlation as appropriate. We defined high- and low-dose catego-
ries using the cohort median dose. For analyses from baseline to 1
year, the median dose was calculated for the 32 patients random-
ized to the treatment arm (3.0 3 107/kg precryporeservation,
1.98 3 107/kg infused). For analyses of the composite cohort (all
children 1 year post ACB infusion), we used the median infused
dose for all 63 patients, 2 3 107/kg. Data for this report were
locked on October 25, 2016. This trial is registered with Clinical-
Trials.gov, number NCT01147653.
RESULTS
Characteristics of Patients and ACB Units
Between September 27, 2010 and February 14, 2014, 63 patients
were enrolled and randomized to receive an initial infusion of ACB
(n 5 32) or placebo (n5 31) with a crossover to the alternate
infusion 1 year later (Fig. 1). Subjects’ etiology of CP was classified
as: periventricular leukomalacia (n 5 17), in utero stroke/bleed
(n 5 27), ischemic injury (n 5 7), other multifactorial causes

 (n 5 12). Of these 12 patients, etiologies and MRI findings were
highly variable and included two patients who were born prema-
ture, one with a porencephalic cyst, three with white matter
abnormalities, five with normal MRIs, and one of unclear etiology.
One-third of patients had moderately severe GMFCS levels (3–4)
at study entry. Treatment groups were balanced with respect to
age, sex, race, type, and severity of CP (Table 2).
ACB units were retrieved from 16 international cord blood banks.
All subjects received all infusions as intended. The median precryo-
preservation TNCC of banked ACB units was 4.9 3 108. To achieve
the target TNCC dose of 1–5 3 107/kg, the entire ACB unit was used
in 31 patients. In the other 32 patients for whom the cell dose from
the whole ACB unit would have exceeded the dosing range, a portion
of the ACB unit was used for infusion and the remainder was cryo-
preserved and stored for potential future use. Post-thaw, a median of
2 3 107 TNCC/kg were administered (range 0.38–5.03 3 107/kg),
containing a CD341 dose of 0.5 3 105/kg (range 0.05–4.9 3 105/
kg). ACB unit characteristics are shown in Table 2.
Safety of ACB Infusions
Infusions of thawed ACB and placebo products, both containing
DMSO, were well tolerated, and there were no serious adverse
events related to the infusions. One patient had transient infusion
reactions consisting of hives 1/– low-grade fever after both pla-
cebo and ACB infusions, successfully treated with additional
diphenhydramine. Despite negative precryopreservation cultures,
one ACB unit grew b-hemolytic streptococcus from a sample of
the thawed unit. That patient was not treated with antibiotics and
did well.
GMFM-66 Results
Change in GMFM-66 score from baseline to 1-year was the pri-
mary endpoint. The observed mean change in GMFM-66 score
was 7.5 points (SD 6.8) in the ACB group and 6.9 points (SD 5.5) in
the placebo group (tdf 5 61, 5 0.36, p5 .72, Fig. 2). Of note, both
groups improved more than expected based on patients’ age and
GMFCS level at study entry [16]. However, subjects randomized to
ACB who were treated with TNCC doses above the median pre-
cryopreservation or infused doses of 3 3 107/kg and 1.98 3 107/
kg, respectively, demonstrated statistically significant, clinically
meaningful improvement in GMFM-66 change scores, above
MCIDs, compared with subjects who received lower cell doses
(p < .01 for precryopreservation dose, p 5 .05 for infused dose) or
placebo (p5 .02 for precryopreservation dose) (Fig. 2B). Cell

 doses were not associated with baseline age or type/severity of
CP (Table 2). In the placebo group, change from baseline to 1 year
was not associated with the precryopreservation cell dose avail-
able in the subjects’ ACB unit (not shown). CD34 cell doses were
not associated with motor improvement.
To examine the effect of cell dose and to adjust response for
the natural history of expected gains based on baseline GMFCS
levels and GMFM-66 scores of each subject, we used published
percentiles [16] to compare the actual GMFM-66 score change
to the predicted change. The difference between the observed
1-year GMFM-66 score and the predicted 1-year GMFM-66 score
was then calculated. Since percentile values are only available
for children �2 years, this analysis included the 38 patients who
were �2 years old at study entry. There was no significant differ-
ence in the median observed-expected difference in GMFM-66
scores at 1 year in patients randomized to ACB (n 5 19; 1.7; IQR
22.5 to 4.5) versus placebo (n5 19; 2.2; IQR 0.0 to 3.0;
p 5 .99). However, in an exploratory analysis, subjects who
received a TNCC �2 3 107/kg (n 5 9) improved a median of 4.3
points (IQR 2.8–5.9) greater than expected, and this change was
statistically significantly different from that observed in subjects
who received <2 3 107/kg (n 5 10; median 21.9, IQR 23.9 to
1.7; p 5 .02) or placebo (n5 19; median 2.2, IQR 0.0 to 3.0;
p 5 .05, Fig.2C), with improvement above the MCID of large
effect size.
We then used the 2-year data to further explore the effect of
cell dose by comparing the difference between observed and
expected GMFM-66 scores 1 year after ACB infusion in all subjects
who were �2 years old when they were treated (n 5 46), regard-
less of when the infusion was given (baseline or 1 year). In this
analysis, the dose relationship from the primary analysis was con-
firmed: subjects who received �2 3 107 cells per kg (n5 23)
improved a median 3.6 points (IQR 20.4 to 4.5) greater than
expected, whereas subjects who received <2 3 107/kg did not
improve beyond expectation (median 21.1, IQR 23.7 to 1.3,
p 5 .003, Fig. 3A).
PDMS-2 Results
At 1 year post initial treatment (ACB vs. placebo), 50 patients
were eligible for analysis of the PDMS-2 Gross Motor Quotient,
which assesses gross motor skills in young children from birth to
72 months of age. Of note, eight subjects excluded from analysis
of observed-expected GMFM-66 scores due to age (<2 years)
were included in the PDMS analysis. The median change from
baseline did not differ significantly between randomized groups

 (ACB 1.0, IQR 24.5 to 4.5 vs. placebo 20.5, IQR 24.0 to 2.0;
p 5 .39); but analysis of the treated group by infused cell dose
confirmed the observation from the GMFM-66 analysis, with
greater improvement in the high dose group (Fig. 2D). The dose
finding was consistent in the 2-year analysis, when all subjects
treated with ACB were analyzed by infused TNCC (>/<2 3 107/
kg); subjects receiving high doses showed statistically significant
improvement compared with subjects receiving lower doses
(median [IQR]: high-dose 3.0 [–2.0 to 9.0] vs. low-dose 0 [–4.0 to

 parcellation could not be obtained in approximately one-third of
subjects due to injury that distorted normal brain morphology,
leaving 23 treated and 15 placebo patients with evaluable connec-
tivity data (n5 38). Data from 17 of these subjects has been
reported previously [17].There were no statistically significant dif-
ferences in CP type, GMFCS level, or age between patients with
and without analyzable images.
There was a moderate correlation between change in GMFM-
66 score and total connectivity 1 year after baseline in all analyz-
able subjects (n5 38, Spearman r5 0.53; 95%CI: 0.25, 0.73;
p < .001). In this cohort, total connectivity change was not related
to baseline GMFCS level, typography of CP, or sex, but was inver-
sely correlated with age (Spearman r 5 20.52; 95%CI: 20.72,
20.23; p 5 .001). In the 2-year analysis when all evaluable sub-
jects were examined by cell dose, patients who received �2 3
107 TNCC/kg (n5 19) demonstrated a statistically significant
greater increase in normalized whole brain connectivity 1 year
after treatment than children who received lower doses (n5 19;
p 5 .04, Fig. 3C). In the sensorimotor network, nodes with signifi-
cant increases in connectivity that correlated with improvement
in GMFM-66 scores included the pre- and post-central gyri, basal
ganglia, and brain stem.
DISCUSSION
We tested whether a single IV infusion of ACB could improve
GMFM-66 change scores in young children with CP. We observed
that children who received higher cell doses (�2 3 107/kg
infused) demonstrated superior gains in both whole brain connec-
tivity and motor function 1 year after infusion of ACB. Based on
preclinical models, we hypothesized that ACB acts through homol-
ogous paracrine signaling, rather than cellular integration or
engraftment of infused cells.
There are some limitations of this study. The first is the small
sample size and heterogeneity of patients within groups. Also, in
this study cohort, both randomized groups including placebo
patients experienced gains in motor function above those pre-
dicted by the GMFM-66. This may reflect the impact of develop-
mental therapies and other interventions in the highly motivated
and resourced families who participated in this study. Nonethe-
less, the median change in GMFM-66 score in the high-dose group
(8.5, IQR 5.5–14.5), exceeded that of the low-dose (4, IQR 0.0–
10.0) and placebo (6, IQR 3.0–11.0) groups by more than estab-
lished MCIDs [13], indicating a statistically significant and clinically
meaningful difference between dosing groups. These responses
were not correlated with age or type, etiology, or severity of CP.
The observation that children receiving cell doses �2 3 107/
kg had a response is important. As a therapeutic dose had not
been established in this setting, we targeted a TNCC 1–5 3 107/kg
based on safety data for this range in children undergoing alloge-
neic cord blood transplantation. However, in additional analyses,
we observed that children with CP demonstrated statistically sig-
nificant improvement in gross motor function on two well-
validated measures (GMFM-66, PDMS) when ACB was adminis-
tered at doses (3 3 107/kg precryopreservation and 2 3 107/kg
infused) that are above the threshold for hematopoietic reconsti-
tution in allogeneic transplantation [18]. This finding is consistent
with two other randomized trials of cell therapy in children with
CP, both conducted in Korea using allogeneic cord blood [19, 20].

and cognitive scales six months after treatment in patients

107/
kg1 erythropoietin versus those who received erythropoietin
alone or placebo. They also noted a dose correlation, with higher
doses associated with greater improvement [19]. The second
study showed similar results in 36 children treated with cord
blood or placebo [20].
Important relationships were also detected via whole brain
connectome analysis of MRI/DTI data, an objective measure of
whole brain connectivity including the motor network, suggesting
that improvements in motor function result from increased or
new connectivity induced by paracrine signaling of ACB cells. We
confirmed that increased total brain connectivity is correlated
with increased motor improvement, as reported by our previous
studies [17]. Furthermore, we also showed that compared with
children who received a low cell dose, children who received a
dose �2 3 107/kg demonstrated a greater increase in both nor-
malized total brain connectivity and changes in the sensorimotor
network, including the pre- and post-central gyri, deep gray mat-
ter, and brain stem (Fig. 3) 1 year post-treatment with ACB.
Although the primary manifestation of CP is motor in nature, it is
well known that CP can affect multiple aspects of development
and in many cases is a whole-brain disorder. Thus, whole brain
connectivity, along with graphical analysis of the brain connec-
tome including the motor network, may serve as a biomarker of
treatment response and may help elucidate the mechanism of
action of ACB therapy in this patient population.
In the course of conducting this study, we were contacted by
hundreds of families of children with CP who did not have a quali-
fied ACB unit available. If umbilical cord blood is indeed estab-
lished as a source of cells for restorative therapies, a method to
provide treatment to such individuals will be necessary. As the
hypothesized mechanism of action—that cells contained in ACB
act on endogenous cells in the brain via paracrine signaling to
enhance brain connectivity and thus function—does not require
engraftment or integration of infused cells, it is feasible that donor
cord blood cells may be equally efficacious. Therefore, we plan to
study the safety and efficacy of allogeneic cell sources in future
studies.
CONCLUSION
Results of this trial suggest that when dosed �2 3 107 cells per
kg, an IV infusion of ACB improves whole brain connectivity and
motor function in young children with CP. These findings have
important implications for the treatment of children with CP and
should be further explored in future studies. As it is not feasible
for every child to have an available ACB unit, studies of allogeneic
cord blood should also be pursued.
