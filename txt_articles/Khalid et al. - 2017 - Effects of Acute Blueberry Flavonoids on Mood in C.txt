Abstract: Epidemiological evidence suggests that consumption of flavonoids (usually via fruits and
vegetables) is associated with decreased risk of developing depression. One plausible explanation
for this association is the well-documented beneficial effects of flavonoids on executive function
(EF). Impaired EF is linked to cognitive processes (e.g., rumination) that maintain depression and
low mood; therefore, improved EF may reduce depressionogenic cognitive processes and improve
mood. Study 1: 21 young adults (18–21 years old) consumed a flavonoid-rich blueberry drink and
a matched placebo in a counterbalanced cross-over design. Study 2: 50 children (7–10 years old)
were randomly assigned to a flavonoid-rich blueberry drink or a matched placebo. In both studies,
participants and researchers were blind to the experimental condition, and mood was assessed
using the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule before and 2 h after consumption of the drinks.
In both studies, the blueberry intervention increased positive affect (significant drink by session
interaction) but had no effect on negative affect. This observed effect of flavonoids on positive affect
in two independent samples is of potential practical value in improving public health. If the effect
of flavonoids on positive affect is replicated, further investigation will be needed to identify the
mechanisms that link flavonoid interventions with improved positive mood.

1. Introduction
Major depressive disorder is the leading international cause of disability and is estimated to
affect 350 million people worldwide [1]. It is the second most common cause of death in 15–29 years
old, via suicide [1]. Current treatments for depression include psychological therapies and a range
of pharmacological agents. The treatment options recommended for children and adolescents
are limited, with only one recommended pharmacological treatment, fluoxetine, in addition to
psychotherapy. These treatment options are further constrained because of concerns about the use
of anti-depressant medication with young people, and because most young people do not have easy
access to psychological therapies [2–4]. Therefore, there is a pressing need for alternative interventions,
especially those that offer a cost-effective and practical means of preventing, or alleviating, depression
in this population.
A common symptom of depression is impaired cognitive functioning, with significant deficits in
executive functioning (EF). EF is an umbrella term, describing cognitive processes such as working
memory, planning, problem-solving, cognitive flexibility, inhibitory control, directing attention,
thoughts and, therefore, behaviours. Impaired EF is believed to maintain depressive symptoms,

such as negative self-perception and low mood, via perseveration and rumination [5–8]. Importantly,
EF is associated with the development of the frontal area of the brain, an area that continues to mature
and develop throughout adolescence and into early adulthood [9,10]. Thus, any disturbance to the
development of the frontal region during this critical period (for example because of an episode of
depression) can have a long-lasting impact, and may explain why depression that occurs during
adolescence and early adulthood is associated with long-term impairments into adult life [11,12].
Flavonoids are a class of polyphenols (micronutrients) found naturally in fruits, vegetables,
tea, coffee and cocoa.
Flavonoid consumption has been associated with both vascular and
cognitive benefits across the lifespan [13–17]. Single-dose flavonoid interventions have produced
improvements in attention, inhibition, visuospatial memory, and executive function between 2–6 h
post-consumption [14,18–20], whilst supplementation of flavonoids for 1.5–8 weeks has been associated
with improved visuospatial memory and improved long-term memory [15,21,22]. Numerous
mechanisms of action have been investigated to explain the beneficial effects of flavonoids on cognition.
These include increases in cerebral blood flow, protecting against neuronal stress via anti-inflammatory
and anti-oxidative effects, and positively stimulating neural signaling pathways, such as Extracellular
Signal-Regulated Kinase (ERK), Serine/Threonine-specific Protein Kinase (Akt) and Brain-Derived
Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), leading to improved neural signaling [15,21,23,24].
Independently of the experimental evidence that shows flavonoids improve cognitive performance,
there is emerging evidence that flavonoids may also support mental health and well-being.
Epidemiological data shows that lifetime consumption of fruit and vegetables (and therefore higher
flavonoid consumption) predicts a lower incidence of depression in later life [25–29]. The benefits are
also seen earlier in life; a recent systematic review concluded that whilst the quality of evidence was
weak, there was a consistent body of research reporting cross-sectional and longitudinal associations
between nutrition and mental health in children and young people [30]. Similar findings have been
shown by other authors [31,32]. However, there is an absence of studies exploring the effects of
flavonoid-rich interventions on mood.
Given the well-documented links between flavonoid consumption and cognition, and between
cognition and depression, the studies reported in this paper assess the acute effects of flavonoid-rich
wild blueberries (WBB) on mood two hours post-consumption. This two-hour interval coincides with
the time-frame for the peak absorption and metabolism of the anthocyanins present in blueberries [33].
In addition, it is important to establish whether acute effects on mood are observable prior to
considering a chronic flavonoid-based intervention for mood outcomes. Two independent groups,
healthy children and young adults, were recruited. These groups represent individuals who are at
crucial stages of mental and cognitive development and thus plausible points at which prevention and
public health interventions may be particularly powerful.
2. Materials and Methods
The research was reviewed and given a favorable ethical opinion for conduct by the University of
Reading Research Ethics Committee (2015-148-CW & UREC 15/10) and was conducted in accordance
with the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants were screened for food related allergies or other
health conditions, e.g., diabetes, heart disease, blood pressure, thyroid, kidney and liver diseases
which would exclude them from the study.
2.1. Study 1 (Young Adults)
Participants: 21 undergraduate students were recruited from University of Reading; 19 females
and two males aged between 18 and 21 years (Mean (M) = 20.14 years, Standard Deviation (SD) = 1.01).
Drink preparation and consumption: All interventions were prepared on site, no more than 20 min
before consumption, by an independent researcher who did not administer the drink to participants.
The flavonoid-rich wild blueberry (WBB) drink contained 253 mg anthocyanins and was prepared by
mixing 30 g of freeze-dried WBB with 30 mL of low-flavonoid Rocks Orange Squash and 220 mL of
 Nutrients 2017, 9, 158

water. The placebo drink was matched to the WBB drink for vitamin C (4 mg), sugars (8.90 g fructose,
7.99 g glucose), 30 mL Rocks Orange Squash and 220 mL of water. Drinks were prepared in an opaque
cup and straw to ensure that double-blinding was maintained.
Mood Measure: The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule-NOW (PANAS-NOW) was used to
assess current mood. The PANAS-NOW is a valid and reliable 20-item (10 positive and 10 negative
mood states) self-report measure of Positive Affect (PA) and Negative Affect (NA) [34,35] which can
be used on multiple test occasions. Participants were asked to rate the degree to which they were
currently experiencing each item, on a five-point Likert scale. The ratings of positive and negative
items were summed to calculate an overall positive and overall negative affect score, ranging from
10–50 (lower scores indicating lower levels of positive or negative affect). A cognitive performance
assessment (Modified Flanker Task; MFT) was also administered after each presentation of the PANAS,
the data for which will be reported elsewhere.
Procedure: This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. Informed consent
was obtained from all participants for inclusion before they participated in the study. To minimise
variability caused by prior flavonoid consumption, participants were given a list of high polyphenol
food items (such as tea, coffee, chocolates, most fruit and vegetables) and asked not to consume these
for 24 h before each test session, including the morning of the sessions. All test sessions were scheduled
in the morning and all participants attended three test sessions separated by a minimum three-day
wash-out period (range three to seven days; median three days). This included a practice test day
(Screening), which was described to the participants as the first test day, where all participants received
the placebo drink. This was to ensure participants were fully versed in the experimental procedures
before testing began. Thereafter they were tested on two further occasions, during which the placebo or
flavonoid intervention was administered to each individual in a random order (10 received WBB first).
On each of the three visits to the laboratory, participants completed the baseline mood measure
(PANAS-NOW) on arrival. Immediately following this they consumed the drink. They were asked
to return to the laboratory 2 h later and refrain from eating, exercising or drinking during this
time. However, water consumption was permitted before and during the 2 h break. Upon their
return, participants completed the PANAS-NOW again. Overall, each visit to the laboratory lasted
approximately 30 min.
2.2. Study 2 (Children)
Participants: 52 participants (29 female) aged seven to ten years old (Mean age = 8.241, SD = 0.965)
were recruited from two local primary schools in Berkshire, UK.
Drink preparation and consumption: On the test day, participants were randomly allocated to
receive the wild blueberry drink (n = 28; 17 females; Mean age = 8.236, SD = 0.869) or a matched
placebo (n = 24; 12 females; Mean age = 8.227, SD = 1.031). The contents of each drink were identical
to Study 1, but instead only included 170 mL of water to aid consumption and palatability in a child
population. A confederate prepared all drinks at the school immediately before they were administered
to the participants by the researcher. Drinks were offered in an opaque drinking cup with a black straw
placed through the lid to ensure double blinding.
Measures: A computerised version of the children’s Raven’s Coloured Progressive Matrices
(RCPM) was administered at screening to measure fluid intelligence. This is a well validated measure
assessing non-verbal and reasoning abilities [36]. This measure was included to ensure all participants
were of healthy cognitive functioning for their age, and to ascertain intervention effects in relation
to intelligence. The York Assessment of Reading Comprehension was administered to ascertain
whether participants were at an age-appropriate reading comprehension level. A modified Continuous
Performance Task was also employed to assess possible attentional deficits. Data from these three
tasks were not used in the analysis of the current study. A practice of the child version of the Positive
and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS-C) and cognitive task battery was also undertaken to ensure
understanding of the tasks and reduce practice effects. This practice data was not analysed.

For the main test sessions, the PANAS-C was administered alongside a 40 min cognitive battery
which included Rey’s Auditory Verbal Learning Task (RAVLT), Modified Flanker Task (MFT) and
Test of Word Reading Efficiency (TOWRE-2) [37–39]. The cognitive performance data is reported
elsewhere [40].
PA and NA were calculated by summing positive and negative items using the validated children’s
version of the PANAS; PANAS-C [36]. The PANAS-C has 30 items (15 positive and 15 negative
emotions) and includes the original 20 items from PANAS-NOW and 10 additional child-friendly
synonym items derived from the PANAS-X (Expanded Form). This was administered and analysed as
in study one.
Procedure: This study was also double-blind and placebo-controlled. A between-groups design
was used to minimise disruption to the school and demand on participants. All children took part in
a screening session one to two days before the main test day. The main test day consisted of a baseline
session and a post-consumption session 2 h later. All parents or legal guardians gave written consent
for their child to take part, and each child gave verbal assent before any research began. Parents
confirmed that their child had no allergies or food intolerances that would prevent them from taking
part. To accommodate school hours, children were tested during the afternoon at school. They were not
required to fast prior to testing. However, parents were asked to make sure that their child consumed
a low-flavonoid diet for 24 h before the baseline session, including breakfast and lunch on the main
test day. Parents were telephoned after their child’s screening session to give them the date of their
child’s next test day, and to remind them about the dietary restrictions. School canteen staff members
were also asked to monitor children’s meals on the day of testing and to remind the children taking
part in the study not to eat high-flavonoid foods for lunch that day.
Children were tested individually in a quiet space at school on two separate occasions, one to
two days apart. On day one, children completed the screening and practice tasks outlined previously.
On testing day 2, after a low-flavonoid lunch, participants completed the PANAS-C and cognitive
battery (data reported elsewhere [40]), before consuming the placebo or flavonoid drink. They then
returned to their classrooms and were asked not to exercise or consume anything except water.
After 2 h, participants individually completed the PANAS-C and a matched version of the cognitive
battery again in the presence of the researcher. Participants were given a written debrief about the
study aims and were given similar debrief information to take home to their parents.
2.3. Analysis
Data was analysed using SPSS (Version 22.0). In both studies, PA and NA were dependent
variables in a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Drink (placebo, WBB) and Session (pre- and
post-consumption) as independent variables. For study 1, this was a fully repeated measures 2 × 2
ANOVA (as participant consumed both drinks and were tested at all time points), and for study 2
this was a mixed 2 × 2 ANOVA (as participants consumed either the placebo or WBB, and were
tested at both time points). Significant main effects and interactions were explored with Bonferroni
corrected post-hoc t-tests. Baseline differences in intelligence quotient (IQ (study 2) were examined
using one-way ANOVAs with Drink (placebo and WBB) as the independent variable.
3. Results
3.1. Study 1 (Young Adults)
Figure 1 shows PA and NA before and after consumption of the placebo and WBB drinks.
There was no significant main effect of Drink on positive affect (F(1,20) = 1.24, p = 0.28). There was
a significant main effect of Session (F(1,20) = 10.67, p = 0.004) and a significant Drink × Session
interaction (F(1,20) = 7.5, p = 0.013). Subsequent Bonferroni-corrected post-hoc t-tests demonstrated
that there was a significant increase in PA after consuming the WBB drink (pre: M = 22.76, SD = 9.01
and post: M = 29.48, SD = 8.60; t(20) = −4.68, p < 0.001). There was no change in PA after consuming

the placebo drink (pre: M = 24.0, SD = 9.59 and post: M = 25.24, SD = 8.50; t(20) = −0.73, p = 0.48,
Figure 1a). Post-hoc tests showed no significance difference in PA and NA between drinks at baseline
(p > 0.05) but there was a significant difference in PA scores post-consumption between the placebo
and WBB drink (t(20) = 2.286, p = 0.033). The main effect of Session was explained by an increase in PA
post-consumption (M = 27.36, SD = 8.55) relative to pre-consumption (M = 23.38, SD = 9.3), which,
as indicated by the significant interaction, was driven by the WBB drink.
There was a significant main effect of Session on NA (F(1,20) = 8.30, p = 0.009). After consuming
both placebo and WBB drinks, the participants reported a reduction in NA (pre: M = 13.17, SD = 2.67
and post: M = 12.19, SD = 2.49; Figure 1b). This may be explained by postprandial blood glucose effects
due to the matched sugar content of both drinks. There was no significant main effect of Drink on NA
(F(1,20) = 0.67, p = 0.42) and no significant Drink x Session interaction on NA (F(1,20) = 0.51, p = 0.49).

0.05) but there was a significant difference in PA scores post‐consumption between the placebo and 
WBB drink (t(20) = 2.286, p = 0.033). The main effect of Session was explained by an increase in PA 
post‐consumption (M = 27.36, SD = 8.55) relative to pre‐consumption (M = 23.38, SD = 9.3), which, as 
indicated by the significant interaction, was driven by the WBB drink.

effects due to the matched sugar content of both drinks. There was no significant main effect of

3.1. Study 2 (Children) 
Forty‐nine participants were included in the analysis of IQ due to three missing data files. There 
were no significant differences at baseline between groups for IQ (Ravens: WBB group, M = 26.78, 
SD = 4.31; Placebo group, M = 26.55, SD = 5. 98; F(1,47) = 0.024, p = 0.878), PA (WBB group, M = 49.00, 
SD = 11.96; Placebo group, M = 49.21, SD = 10.04; F(1,50) = 0.005, p = 0.947) or NA (WBB group, M = 
20.79, SD = 7.43; Placebo group, M = 19.25, SD = 3.86; F(1,50) = 0.832, p = 0.366). 
Figure 2 shows PA and NA in both groups before and after the intervention. There was no 
significant main effect of Session (F(1,50) = 1.362, p = 0.249) or Drink (F(1,50) = 0.456, p = 0.503) for PA. 
However, there was a significant Session × Drink interaction (F(1,50) = 4.176, p = 0.046). Paired 
samples t‐tests for each condition revealed no significant change in PA after consuming the placebo 
drink (pre: M = 49.21, SD = 16.04 and post: M = 48.29, SD = 15.51; t(23) = 0.564, p = 0.578), but a 
significant increase in PA after consuming the WBB drink (pre: M = 49.0, SD = 14.86 and post: M = 
52.36, SD = 14.36; t(27) = −2.495, p = 0.019; Figure 2a). There was no significant difference in PA 
between placebo and WBB at the post‐consumption time point (t(52) = −1.597, p = 0.116). 
Negative Affect in both groups is shown in Figure 2b. There was no significant main effect of 
Session (F(1,50) = 0.009, p = 0.927) or Drink (F(1,50) = 0.355, p = 0.554) on NA. There was also no 
significant Session × Drink interaction (F(1,50) = 0.453, p = 0.504; Figure 2b). NA did not change 2 h 
after consuming either the placebo (pre: M = 19.25, SD = 8.73 and post: M = 19.79, SD = 9.78) or the 
WBB drink (pre: M = 20.79, SD = 8.09 and post: M = 20.07, SD = 9.06).

4. Discussion 
These randomised, placebo‐controlled, double‐blind studies investigated the effects of acute 
consumption of a flavonoid‐rich wild blueberry drink on the mood of healthy children and young 
adults. In both studies, increased Positive Affect was observed 2 h after consumption of the 
flavonoid‐rich WBB drink (significant drink by session interaction). The flavonoid drink had no 
effect on Negative Affect. The effect of flavonoids on mood was consistent across two populations, at 
two different time points (morning and afternoon), and in a between‐ and within‐subject design. 
Thus, the positive effect of blueberry flavonoids on Positive Affect appears to be robust to variations 
in experimental design.  
The distinctive effect of flavonoids on PA but not NA is notable. PA and NA reflect orthogonal 
facets of mood. A low PA is more highly linked to depression, and high NA is more closely related 
to anxiety [34–36]. Thus, these data suggest that the effect of flavonoid consumption on mood may 
be specific to depressive disorders, rather than pervasive across different mood states. In the young 
adult study, both drinks led to a decrease in NA. This may be due to the sugar content of both the 
drinks, as dietary carbohydrates have been shown to enhance the uptake of circulating tryptophan 
(a precursor of serotonin) into the brain by promoting insulin secretion [41,42]. 
Although preliminary, these results are intriguing and warrant focused investigation of the 
relationship between flavonoids and mood, as well as with mental health more generally. It is 
important to note that diagnosis of mental health disorders or consumption of medication were not 
specific exclusion criteria; however, the data showed normal levels of PA and NA [34,43], indicating 
a healthy sample. The young adult participants were predominantly female, and therefore these 
results may not be generalisable to a male population; however, there is no evidence to suggest a 
gender‐specific mechanism underlying the effects of flavonoids on the brain. The child sample was 
of average IQ, and the young adult population was recruited from a University population and thus 
likely to have an average to above‐average IQ. No carry‐over effects of flavonoids are expected as 
the half‐life of flavonoids is estimated to range from 2–28 h and there was a minimum of three days 
insured between the test days [44]. 
Mood is by definition a short‐term experience. In non‐clinical populations mood is usually 
labile. However, sustained periods of low mood (dysphoria) are a strong predictor of the emergence 
of major depressive disorder. Therefore, if acute flavonoid consumption improves Positive Affect, 
sustained consumption of flavonoids may help prevent dysphoria, and thus, major depression. 
Given that depression tends to emerge for the first time during adolescence or early adulthood, and 
is likely to reemerge as a relapse later in life, an intervention which increases flavonoid consumption 
during this critical period of development could decrease the incidence of adolescent and life‐long 
depression. 
The mechanism linking flavonoids and mood is not known and requires greater consideration. 
There are a number of plausible mechanisms which may explain these results. First is the finding 
that flavonoids increase cerebral blood flow [45]. One of the last brain structures to mature is the

specific exclusion criteria; however, the data showed normal levels of PA and NA [34,43], indicating
a healthy sample. The young adult participants were predominantly female, and therefore these
results may not be generalisable to a male population; however, there is no evidence to suggest
a gender-specific mechanism underlying the effects of flavonoids on the brain. The child sample was
of average IQ, and the young adult population was recruited from a University population and thus
likely to have an average to above-average IQ. No carry-over effects of flavonoids are expected as
the half-life of flavonoids is estimated to range from 2–28 h and there was a minimum of three days
insured between the test days [44].
Mood is by definition a short-term experience. In non-clinical populations mood is usually labile.
However, sustained periods of low mood (dysphoria) are a strong predictor of the emergence of major
depressive disorder. Therefore, if acute flavonoid consumption improves Positive Affect, sustained
consumption of flavonoids may help prevent dysphoria, and thus, major depression. Given that
depression tends to emerge for the first time during adolescence or early adulthood, and is likely to
reemerge as a relapse later in life, an intervention which increases flavonoid consumption during this
critical period of development could decrease the incidence of adolescent and life-long depression.
The mechanism linking flavonoids and mood is not known and requires greater consideration.
There are a number of plausible mechanisms which may explain these results. First is the finding
that flavonoids increase cerebral blood flow [45]. One of the last brain structures to mature is the
 Nutrients 2017, 9, 158

dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), a site within the frontal lobes highly associated with cognitive
control [46] and emotional regulation [47]. Increased cerebral blood flow to this area may help
strengthen neural circuitry in the frontal lobes, where cognitive and emotional control is located.
This is consistent with the evidence linking executive functioning with low mood, and suggests an
indirect pathway whereby flavonoid consumption enhances cerebral blood flow, boosting executive
functioning, and thus helping to inhibit cognitive features (i.e., rumination) that maintain depression.
A second, alternative explanation for the link between flavonoids and mood is the effect of
anthocyanins (a subtype of flavonoids) on Monoamine Oxidase (MAO) inhibition. MAO is involved
in the oxidation of monoamines, some of which are neurotransmitters involved in the regulation of
mood (e.g., serotonin, dopamine, and noradrenaline). MAO inhibitors have been used to treat mood
disorders. Thus, the consumption of fruits high in flavonoids, such as blackcurrants, may significantly
reduce MAO activity, thereby increasing circulating monoamines, and elevating mood [48]. This would
suggest a direct pathway between flavonoid consumption and mood.
A third possible mechanism is the ability for flavonoids to mimic anxiolytic-like effects by binding
to benzodiazepine receptors, which influences the effects of Gamma Amino Butyric Acid (GABA) via
GABAA receptors [49,50]. GABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter present exclusively in the central
nervous system. In addition to regulating cognition, decreased levels of GABA are associated with
mood disorders. However, in the two studies reported here, the absence of an effect of flavonoid
consumption on NA (a strong indicator of anxiety) suggests that the GABA hypothesis may not be
a plausible explanation for the observed acute effects on PA.
5. Conclusions
This study demonstrated acute effects of blueberry flavonoid consumption on Positive Affect and
no effect on Negative Affect in healthy children and young adults. Dietary interventions could play
a key role in promoting positive mood and are a possible way to prevent dysphoria and depression.
Given the potential implications of these findings for preventing depression, a disabling and common
mental health problem in adolescents and adults, it is important to replicate the study and assess the
potential to translate these findings to practical, cost-effective and acceptable interventions.
