Summary
Background: Emotional over-eating (EOE) and emotional under-eating (EUE) are
common behaviours that develop in early childhood and are hypothesised to play a
role in weight status. Data from a British twin cohort demonstrated that environmental,
rather than genetic, factors shape individual differences in both behaviours in early
childhood.
Objective: The aim of this current study was to replicate this finding in a subsample
(n = 398) of 4-year-old twins selected for high or low risk of obesity from another
population-based cohort of British twins (the Twins Early Development Study).
Methods: Parental ratings of child EOE and EUE were analysed using genetic
model fitting.
Results: Genetic influence was not significant, while shared environmental factors
explained 71% (52–79%) of the variance in EOE and 77% (62–85%) in EUE. The two
behaviours correlated positively (r = 0.53, 95% CI: 0.44, 0.61), and about two-thirds
of the shared environmental factors influencing EOE and EUE were the same
(rC = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.51, 0.85).
Conclusions: Emotional eating in childhood is shaped by the home family
environment; parents are therefore promising intervention targets.
Keywords: Childhood obesity, eating behaviour, emotional eating, twin research.
Introduction
Stress and negative emotions can have differential im-
pacts on appetite, with some individuals experiencing
decreased, and some increased, desire to eat (1).
These behaviours, termed emotional over-eating
(EOE) and emotional under-eating (EUE), have been
implicated in the development of childhood weight (2)
and eating disorders (3). Data from the Gemini twin
study (2402 families; 4804 twins) showed that both
EOE (4) and EUE (5) are shaped primarily by the shared
family environment, not by genes, in early childhood.
This contrasts strongly with other eating behaviours
foundtobeundersubstantialgeneticcontrolinearlylife
(6,7). Replication is an essential part of scientific prog-
ress (8), and herewe aimed to verify the strongenviron-
mental component to child EOE and EUE in a sample
selected for high and low obesity risk.
Methods
Data were from a subsample of the Twins Early Devel-
opment Study (9), which included 214 pairs of twins
from ‘obese’ and ‘lean’ families. One hundred sets
of overweight or parents with obesity [maternal body
mass index {BMI} > 28.5, paternal BMI > 25] and
114 healthy weight parents (both parents’ BMI < 25)
were identified and matched by social class, indexed
using parental occupation. Families were visited at
home for data collection when the twins were 4 years
old (10). All anthropometrics were measured by the
researchers. Parents indicated the ethnicity of their
children by choosing between White and non-White.
Parents reported on their children’s emotional eat-
ing using the Child Eating Behaviour Questionnaire
(11) subscales for EOE (four items, example item:
‘My child wants to eat more when irritable’) and EUE
(four items, example item: ‘My child wants to eat less
when sad’). BMI-standard deviation (SD) scores were
calculated for the children using British 1990 growth
reference data (12,13).
Analyses
Prior to analyses, EOE and EUE scores were
regressed by gestational age, age at measurement

 and sex. The twin method compares the twin pair sim-
ilarity of mono-zygotic (MZ) and di-zygotic (DZ) twin
pairs to decompose variation in EOE and EUE into
three latent factors – additive genetic influences (A,
heritability), shared (C) and non-shared environmental
influences (E). A great difference between MZ and
DZ twin similarity implies significant contribution from
genetic factors, whereas similar twin correlations, re-
gardless of zygosity, indicate a contribution of the
shared environment. Here, in addition, a bivariate cor-
related factors model was used to derive aetiological
correlations between EOE and EUE, indicating the ex-
tent to which the genetic (rA), shared environmental
(rC) and unique environmental (rE) influences underly-
ing the two behaviours are the same (14). Analyses
use maximum likelihood structural equation modelling
and were carried out using OpenMx (15), a statistical
package in R.
Results
Data for EOE and EUE were available for 394 twins
(197 pairs) when the children were 4 years old
(Table
1).
EOE
and
EUE
correlated
positively
[r = 0.53, 95% confidence interval {CI}: 0.44, 0.61].

with the saturated model which estimates means

(Δχ2 = 6.134, Δ Df = 17, p = 0.99). Heritability was
not significant for either EOE (A = 0.03, 95% CI:
0.00, 0.25) or EUE (A = 0.04, 95% CI: 0.00, 0.21),
but CIs were wide. Shared environmental influences
were strong for both EOE (C = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.52,
0.79) and EUE (C = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.62, 0.85). The
contributions from non-shared environmental factors
were moderate (EOE: E = 0.26, 95% CI: 0.19, 0.34;
EUE: E = 0.19, 95% CI: 0.14, 0.25).
The aetiological correlations indicated that only
shared environmental factors (rC = 0.67, 95% CI:
0.51, 0.85) were common to both behaviours be-
cause neither genetic nor non-shared environmental
correlations were significant (rE = 0.21, 95% CI:
�0.00, 0.38; rA = 0.26, 95% CI: �1.00, 0.99).
Figure 1 shows a path diagram illustrating the results.
Discussion
This twin study of the aetiology of EOE and EUE in
early childhood replicated previous findings from
the Gemini twin cohort. As previously found (5),
EOE and EUE correlated positively (r = 0.53), indi-
cating that some children tend to both over-eat
and under-eat in response to stress. Previous re-
search has suggested that an individual’s appetitive
response to stress might be due to the nature and
intensity of the stress – consistent low level stress
relating to over-eating, whereas intense stress might
lead to under-eating (17). Results supported that
both behaviours are learned in childhood, with the
shared environment exerting the strongest effect.
Genetic
contributions
were
minimal
and
non-
significant. Furthermore, EOE and EUE had some
shared aetiology, in line with previous findings; ap-
proximately two thirds of the shared environmental
influences
on
each
behaviour
were
the
same
(rC = 0.67). Notably, this sample was selected to in-
clude families with varying degrees of obesity risk,
increasing the heterogeneity and representativeness
of the findings. The mean and SD of the BMI-SD

 scores (mean = 0.45, SD = 1.19) indicated higher
mean BMI than the UK population-based reference
data for children of this age and sex, as well as large
weight variation in this sample. Limitations were the
reduced sample size, leading to wide CIs, and the
inclusion of only same-sex DZ twin pairs, precluding
testing for aetiological differences between boys and
girls. Furthermore, parental weight is only one of
many risk factors for child obesity and does not
capture the full ‘picture’, and more research is
needed to establish if the aetiology of EOE and
EUE changes with developmental stage. The effect
of stress on eating behaviour is complex, and a pre-
vious study has indicated a Gene–Environment
interaction demonstrating that parents are more in-
clined to use maladaptive feeding strategies if their
children are of increased genetic risk associated
with emotional dysregulation (18).
In summary, this study supported that emotional
eating is learned in early childhood, not inherited.
Shared environmental factors, potentially parental
feeding strategies such as emotional feeding (19),
are key drivers of EOE and EUE regardless of a child’s
familial risk of obesity. These findings highlight family
level factors as promising intervention targets for the
prevention of emotional eating in children.

resent the measured phenotype [emotional over-eating
{EOE} and emotional under-eating {EUE}] using the Child
Eating Behaviour Questionnaire at 4 years of age. The circles
indicate the latent factors: genetic effects (A), shared envi-

(E). The straight single-headed arrows reflect pathways with
the variance explained by each latent factor [including 95%
confidence intervals {CIs}]. The non-significant A paths, with
95% CIs including 0, are represented as dotted lines. The
aetiological correlations are shown on the curved double-
headed arrows. These indicate the extent of common ge-
netic (rA), shared environmental (rC) and non-shared environ-
mental (rE) influences across the two phenotypes. The non-
significant aetiological correlations (rA and rE), with 95% CI
crossing 0, are represented as dotted lines.
