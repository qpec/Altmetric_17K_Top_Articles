Daily moderate exercise (DME) and stress management are underemphasized in the
care of patients with lupus nephritis (LN) due to a poor comprehensive understanding
of their potential roles in controlling the inflammatory response. To investigate these
effects on murine LN, disease progression was monitored with either DME or
social disruption stress (SDR) induction in NZM2410/J mice, which spontaneously
develop severe, early-onset LN. SDR of previously established social hierarchies was
performed daily for 6 days and DME consisted of treadmill walking (8.5 m/min for 45
min/day). SDR significantly enhanced kidney disease when compared to age-matched,
randomly selected control counterparts, as measured by histopathological analysis
of H&E staining and immunohistochemistry for complement component 3 (C3) and
IgG complex deposition. Conversely, while 88% of non-exercised mice displayed
significant renal damage by 43 weeks of age, this was reduced to 45% with
exercise. DME also reduced histopathology in kidney tissue and significantly decreased
deposits of C3 and IgG complexes. Further examination of renal infiltrates revealed
a macrophage-mediated inflammatory response that was significantly induced with
SDR and suppressed with DME, which also correlated with expression of inflammatory
mediators. Specifically, SDR induced IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β, and MCP-1, while DME
suppressed IL-6, TNF-α, IL-10, CXCL1, and anti-dsDNA autoantibodies. These data
demonstrate that psychological stressors and DME have significant, but opposing effects
on the chronic inflammation associated with LN; thus identifying and characterizing
stress reduction and a daily regimen of physical activity as potential adjunct therapies to
complement pharmacological intervention in the management of autoimmune disorders,
including LN.

Effects of Exercise and Social Stress in Lupus
INTRODUCTION
Lupus nephritis (LN), a debilitating clinical manifestation of
systemic lupus erythematous (SLE) contributing to disease
morbidity, affects more than 50% of adult and pediatric
patients with lupus (Imran et al., 2015). The precise effects of
psychological stress modification and exercise in autoimmune-
mediated inflammatory disease, including LN, remain relatively
unknown. However, many animal studies have shown that
psychosocial stress induces a proinflammatory response (Powell
et al., 2013b). In contrast, overwhelming experimental evidence
from epidemiological studies has demonstrated that regular
exercise correlates with an enhanced quality of life, increased life
expectancy, and a reduced risk of mortality (Mokdad et al., 2004).
Consequently, exercise and stress reduction are increasingly
being emphasized as an adjunct to drug therapy because of their
apparent disease modifying properties, but the mechanism(s)
controlling disease pathobiology must be elucidated before
becoming an accepted therapeutic strategy in the treatment of
inflammatory diseases.
Our previous research has shown that psychological stressors
and moderate exercise elicit opposing immunomodulatory
effects.
Murine
restraint
stress
was
shown
to
induce
a
proinflammatory response through enhanced levels of IL-6
(Voorhees et al., 2013). Moreover, social disruption stress (SDR)
induced pulmonary inflammation via increased monocyte and
neutrophil recruitment and activation (Curry et al., 2010).
Conversely, we have also shown that daily moderate exercise
(DME) can significantly reduce systemic inflammatory responses
following lipopolysaccharide injection in mice by suppressing
NF-κB activity (manuscript in review). Interestingly, these
effects were transient and lost after 24 h, which suggests
greater efficacy with a daily regimen. However, the influence
of psychological stressors or daily moderate exercise on LN-
associated inflammatory processes and disease pathology has yet
to be comprehensively examined.
Since SLE pathogenesis involves high levels of autoimmune-
mediated inflammation, this study aimed to investigate the
effects of both moderate exercise and induced social stress on
the inflammatory responses associated with LN in a murine
model, NZM2410/J. These mice spontaneously develop severe,
early onset glomerulonephritis from 20 to 40 weeks of age.
Considering the age of NZM2410/J mice when they develop LN,
we implemented the exercise regimen well before disease onset
as a preventative measure and induced stress at or near the time
of disease onset to potentially exacerbate disease progression.
The objective was to test the hypothesis that SDR induces more
severe inflammatory pathology while DME improves progression
of kidney disease in order to provide supportive evidence for
stress management and moderate exercise as adjunct therapeutic
modalities for LN and other autoimmune diseases.
METHODS
Animals
Female and male NZM2410/J and wild-type C57BL/6 control
mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor,
ME). Mouse maintenance and protocols were approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at The Ohio State
University Wexner Medical Center (OSUWMC). The animal
facility was maintained at 22–23◦C and 30–50% relative humidity
with a 12-h light/dark cycle; chow and water were supplied
ad libitum. blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels were measured
biweekly and weights were recorded weekly. As clinical indicators
of kidney damage, experimental removal criteria was defined by
a threshold of 20% weight loss and a BUN level above 50 mg/dL.
Social Disruption Stress (SDR)
The SDR protocol was carried out as previously described
(Avitsur et al., 2001). Briefly, an aggressor male mouse was
introduced into a cage housing male NZM2410/J mice for 2 h
daily for 6 days. This 6 day exposure results in well-established
and characterized chronic stress response in mice (Powell et al.,
2013a). If mice displayed visible signs of fighting or wounds
following exposure to the aggressor, they were removed from the
study. When a mouse undergoing the SDR protocol reached early
removal criteria (BUN > 50 mg/dL; weight loss > 20%), an age-
matched control NZM2410/J male mouse was randomly selected
for comparative analysis. Experiments were performed separately
and similar trends were observed in 2 experimental cohorts of
n = 9 to demonstrate repeatability. Control NZM2410/J mice
were housed in the same location and handled similarly under
identical standard of care conditions, but not exposed aggressors.
Daily Moderate Exercise (DME)
NZM2410/J female and male mice began exercise at the age of
11–13 weeks. Mice were exercised at 8.5 m/min, 45 min/day,
and 7 days/week, with the exception of 1 day every 2 weeks
for blood collection. Exercise was carried out using a multiple
lane mouse treadmill (Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH).
Control mice were handled similarly, but not exercised on the
treadmill. The primary endpoint of the exercise arm of the
study was mortality; when mice displayed signs of terminal renal
disease (BUN > 50 mg/dL; weight loss > 20%), kidney tissue and
serum were collected. To demonstrate repeatability, experiments
were performed twice in cohorts of n = 11 with similar trends
observed.
Bun Level Measurements
Serum was collected biweekly using the MaxDiscovery Blood
Urea Nitrogen Enzymatic Assay Kit (Bioo Scientific Corporation,
Austin, TX) according to manufacturer’s protocol. Blood was
obtained via submandibular bleeds and serum was isolated
by centrifugation after blood clotting. Absorbance values were
determined using the Dynex MRX-TC Revelation microplate
reader/colorimeter (Dynex Technologies, Chantilly, VA). Results
were exported to Microsoft excel (v2013) for analysis.
ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent
Assay)
Blood was obtained via submandibular bleeding or axillary
vessel incision at the time of sacrifice. Cytokine analysis on
collected serum was done using electrochemiluminescence
detection (V-PLEX Proinflammatory Panel 1 mouse kit; Meso

Anti-dsDNA ELISAs were performed following manufacturer’s
instruction
using
the
Mouse
Anti-dsDNA
kit
(Signosis,
Sunnyvale, CA). Serum from SDR experimental endpoint
was compared with a randomly selected, age-matched control
(non-stressed) NZM2410/J mouse. For analysis of DME, relative
changes in expression were analyzed over a 2 month period of
bi-weekly measurements. MCP-1 ELISAs were performed using
Mouse CCL2 (MCP-1) ELISA Ready-SET-Go! (eBioscience Inc.,
San Diego, CA) according to manufacturer’s protocol.
Histopathology and Image Analysis
Mouse tissues were dissected for paraffin processing according
to previously established protocol (Young et al., 2014). Serial
paraffin sections were used for immunohistochemistry and
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was performed as
detailed formerly (Young et al., 2013). Briefly, slides were
stained in Richard Allan Scientific Hematoxylin (Thermo
Scientific, Waltham, MA) and Eosin-Y (Thermo Scientific) with
the Leica Autostainer (Leica Biosystems, Buffalo Grove, IL).
Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining was performed using rat
anti-mouse F4/80 (1:200; AbD Serotec, Raleigh, NC), rat anti-
mouse C3 (1:50; Abcam, San Francisco, CA), or goat anti-
mouse IgG (1:60,000; Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove,
PA) polyclonal primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature
with the Intellipath Autostainer Immunostaining instrument.
Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies
included the following: rabbit anti-Goat (1:200; Abcam) in 2%
Normal Goat serum (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA) and goat
anti-rat (1:200, Abcam).
Inflammation severity and histopathological scoring was
performed blindly by a board-certified veterinary pathologist
(BB) using the 10x objective of a bright-field light microscope.
Scoring criteria were defined as: 0 = within normal limits
(glomeruli: modest numbers of elongated oval cells within
loops, minimal amount of mesangial matrix, no leukocytes;
interstitium: essentially no mononuclear cells near glomeruli
or tubules; tubules: segments are lined by uniform cuboidal
epithelium with eosinophilic cytoplasm, does not contain
eosinophilic,
protein-rich
casts);

=
minimal
nephritis
(glomeruli: some to many contain a few mononuclear leukocytes
and/or slightly expanded mesangial matrix; interstitium: a few
mononuclear cells are located near affected glomeruli or tubules;
tubules: a few segments are lined by attenuated flat cuboidal
epithelium with basophilic cytoplasm and/or contain casts); 2
= mild nephritis (glomeruli: many contain a diffuse infiltrate of
mononuclear leukocytes without aggregates and/or substantially
expanded mesangial matrix; interstitium: a few mononuclear
cells, including small clusters, are located near affected glomeruli
or tubules; tubules: clusters of segments, especially in the outer
cortex, are lined by attenuated epithelium); 3 = moderate
nephritis (glomeruli: most contain a diffuse infiltrate of
mononuclear leukocytes including small aggregates and/or
substantially expanded mesangial matrix; interstitium: many
mononuclear cells, including small to large clusters, are located
near affected glomeruli or tubules; tubules: large clusters of
segments, especially in the outer cortex, are lined by attenuated
epithelium, and about 5% of tubules contain casts); and 4 =
marked nephritis (glomeruli: most are visibly distorted by a
diffuse infiltrate of mononuclear leukocytes, including large
aggregates, and/or substantially expanded mesangial matrix;
interstitium: many mononuclear cells, with many large clusters,
are located near affected glomeruli or tubules; tubules: large
clusters of segments, especially in the outer cortex, are lined by
attenuated cuboidal epithelium, and many tubules contain casts).
Slides were digitally scanned using the Aperio ScanScope XT
eSlide capture device (Aperio, Vista, CA) and analyzed using
Aperio Digital Image Analysis software (v9.1) to measure pixel
intensities according to previously described methods (Young
et al., 2014). For quantitation of IgG and complement component
3 (C3) protein, the intensity of staining in the glomeruli was
specifically assessed after subtraction of non-specific binding. For
F 4/80, total renal staining (tubulointerstitium and glomeruli)
was measured after normalization accounting for nonspecific
binding.
Statistics
All numerical data were expressed as mean values with standard
error of the mean (SEM) using Graph Pad Prism 6. Statistical
analysis for two groups was performed using unpaired, two-
tailed nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test or unpaired, two-
tailed parametric Student’s t-tests where indicated. Statistical
analysis for three groups was performed using one-way ANOVA
followed by Tukey’s post hoc test. Data was considered statistically
significant if p ≤ 0.05.
RESULTS
Repeated Social Stress Significantly
Enhances Lupus Nephritis Pathology
To examine the effects of psychosocial stressors on chronic
autoimmune-mediated inflammation, NZM2410/J mice were
subjected to the SDR model as previously described (Avitsur
et al., 2001) at 19–23 weeks of age; BUN levels and weights were
monitored. This model has been shown to produce a chronic
stress response in mice, which has been previously characterized
and extensively published on by our research team for more
than 15 years (Powell et al., 2013a). To assess renal disease, early
removal criteria was defined by a threshold of 20% weight loss
and a BUN level above 50 mg/dL. When a mouse undergoing the
SDR protocol met the early removal criteria, kidney tissue and
serum were collected for comparison with a random age-matched
control.
H&E staining revealed that SDR induced infiltration of
mononuclear leukocytes when compared to both control and
wild-type mice (Figure 1A). The inflammatory pathology is
characterized by glomerular hypercellularity and hyperplasia of
the Bowman’s capsule. Confirmation of kidney disease was made
by a blinded analysis performed by a board certified veterinary
pathologist and concluded that SDR induced significantly greater
kidney pathology relative to control mice, which remained within
normal levels (Figure 1A). While the control mice had an average
score of 0.33 ± 0.5, those in the SDR group scored 2.0 ±
1.0 (p < 0.038). Additional IHC staining was done to further

investigate the inflammatory components found in the renal
tissues. Specifically, immune complexes and C3 protein were
measured because of the strong association with renal injury in
LN; inflammatory pathology of LN is characterized by activation
of the compliment cascade, which leads to deposition of C3
fragments on target cells. IHC analysis showed that SDR resulted
in over 50-fold more IgG complex deposition (p < 2 × 10−7;
Figure 1B) and over 8-fold higher C3 staining (p < 0.001;
Figure 1C).
Daily Moderate Exercise Significantly
Reduces Inflammatory Disease in Mice
with Lupus Nephritis
NZM2410/J mice were exercised daily at moderate intensity by
treadmill walking beginning at 11–13 weeks of age (8.5 m/min
for 45 min) to determine the influence of exercise on LN
disease progression. Control mice were handled similarly, but not
exercised on the treadmill. When mice displayed signs of terminal
renal disease (BUN > 50 mg/dL; weight loss > 20%), kidney
tissue and serum were collected for analysis.
After 43 weeks of age, DME reduced severe kidney
damage incidence by 38% and mice meeting experimental
removal criteria differed significantly throughout the course of
experimentation when plotted on a Kaplan–Meier curve (p <
0.05; Figure 2A). Relative to baseline levels taken prior to both
disease onset and DME, BUN levels were 4.6-fold higher (p
< 0.05) in the non-exercised (11 mg/dL ± 4.3) mice at 32
weeks of age when compared to mice that were exercised (2.4
mg/dL ± 1.2). To further confirm changes in inflammatory
pathology, IHC for C3 protein and antibody complexes of IgG
were quantified. Exercised mice showed over 10-fold reduction
in positive staining for IgG antibodies (p < 1 × 10−4; Figure 2B).
Decreased C3 deposition was also detected in exercised mice
(2-fold), but the difference was not statistically significant
(Figure 2C).
Social Stress and Moderate Exercise Both
Influence Inflammatory Mediator
Expression in NZM2410/J Mice
To determine an association between serum cytokine expression
and LN disease progression in the NZM2410/J mouse model,
serum was collected from mice meeting early removal criteria
(BUN > 50 mg/dL; weight loss > 20%) for comparison to
age-matched wild-type controls (32–35 weeks) and younger
NZM2410/J mice (20–25 weeks) not yet meeting these criteria.
While serum levels of IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-12 did not display
a difference between experimental groups (data not shown),
expression of IL-5, IL-6, TNF-α, IL-10, CXCL1, and IL-1β was
elevated in the NZM2410/J mice displaying signs of severe kidney
damage (Figure 3). Specifically, upregulation was observed in the
levels of IL-5 (5-fold; p < 0.05), IL-6 (17-fold; p < 0.01), TNF-
α (14-fold; p < 0.05), IL-10 (15-fold; p < 0.01), and CXCL1
(3.4-fold; p < 0.05) relative to wild-type mice (Figure 3). When
compared to NZM2410/J mice that did not meet experimental
removal criteria, mice showing signs of kidney dysfunction had
significantly higher IL-5 (2.8-fold; p < 0.05), IL-6 (16-fold; p <
0.001), TNF-α (6-fold; p < 0.01), IL-10 (15-fold; p < 0.001), and
CXCL1 (2.5-fold; p < 0.01) (Figure 3).
Using the cytokines identified above showing correlation
to disease progression, the influence of SDR and DME was

examined. In addition to cytokines, anti-dsDNA autoantibody
levels were measured because this has been shown previously to
correlate with glomerulonephritis in NZM2410/J mice (Mohan
et al., 1998). SDR resulted in a significant enhancement of
cytokine expression, including IL-6 by 2.19-fold (p < 0.0003;
U = 247), TNF-α by 1.4-fold (p < 0.0244; U = 356), and IL-
1β by 3.4-fold (p < 0.0001; U = 63); IL-10, CXCL1, and anti-
dsDNA autoantibody levels did not change significantly and
IL-5 expression was downregulated (Figure 4). Since the onset
and progression of renal disease varies from mouse to mouse
in this model, inflammatory mediators were measured over 2
months to display cumulative expression over a broader period
of time in the longitudinal analysis of DME. Thus, these average
scores more effectively express the overall extent of activation
and expression of each proinflammatory cytokine over a larger
window of time. DME resulted in a significant decrease in IL-10

significant changes were observed with IL-5 or IL-1β production
(Figure 5).
Modulation of Macrophage-Mediated
Kidney Inflammation by Social Stress
Induction or Moderate Exercise
Since mononuclear cell infiltration in the kidney correlates
with poor disease outcome in human LN patients (Hill et al.,
2001) and macrophage activation is associated with disease
progression in NZM2410/J mice (Bethunaickan et al., 2014), the
influence of SDR and DME on macrophage-mediated kidney
inflammation was investigated. To determine the influence of
repeated social stress and daily moderate exercise on macrophage
infiltration, IHC was performed on kidney tissue sections for
a common marker of mouse macrophages, F 4/80. Mice from
the SDR cohorts showed a 10.5-fold increase in staining for this
marker compared to control counterparts (p < 3 × 10−5) and
macrophages were detected primarily in the interstitial regions
(Figure 6A). Furthermore, DME reduced macrophage presence
in the tubulointerstitium by 3-fold relative to non-exercised
controls (p < 4 × 10−7; Figure 6B).
Monocyte
chemoattractant
protein
(MCP)-1
promotes
macrophage-mediated inflammation and its association to renal
pathology in autoimmunity is specifically evidenced by elevated
levels in the urine of patients with LN (Noris et al., 1995).
Furthermore, MCP-1 is upregulated similarly both in the serum
and kidney tissue of NZM2410/J mice as autoimmune-mediated
glomerulopathy progresses (Suzuki et al., 2012). Serum levels
were measured in the SDR and DME experimental cohorts to
determine the effects on systemic expression of MCP-1. Relative
to randomly selected controls of the same age, SDR induced
the upregulation of MCP-1 expression by 1.9-fold (p < 5 ×
10−4; Figure 6C). Levels of MCP-1 did not differ significantly
between exercised or non-exercised mice and were similar to
SDR controls (Figure 6D).

DISCUSSION
Physicians recommend that patients with SLE engage in 30–
50 min of exercise approximately 3 times a week due to
the association of exercise with improved patient outcome in
various studies (Yuen and Cunningham, 2014), but optimal
frequency, duration, and extent have yet to be sufficiently
characterized. Furthermore, stress reduction programs offered
to patients with SLE have demonstrated improved disease
activity (Williams et al., 2014) and literature shows the
positive effects of exercise in improvement of SLE disease
management and clinical outcome (Ayán and Martín, 2007).
However, the counseling regarding regular exercise and stress
modification programs varies among physicians and there is
no evidence-based best practice currently. Our data characterize
the effects of SDR and DME on murine LN in the NZM2410/J
model and demonstrate that SDR significantly exacerbates the
inflammatory process whereas this response is dramatically
reduced with DME. This is the first study to our knowledge to
characterize the histopathological and molecular effects of both
exercise and psychosocial stressors on the autoimmune-mediated
inflammation of lupus nephritis; our results suggest that stress

to be applied in adjunct to current pharmacologic treatments of
LN.
Chronic inflammation is a contributing factor to localized
and
systemic
disease
pathogenesis
and
is
influenced
by
both psychosocial stressors and physical exercise. Therefore,
characterizing their immunomodulatory effects could have far-
reaching clinical implication. Our results show that expression
of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10 significantly increases with the
development of more severe lupus-like illness in NZM2410/J
mice, which is in agreement with studies examining cytokine
expression in human SLE (Chun et al., 2007). In addition to
significant deposition of IgG and C3 complexes, the NZM2410/J
mice exposed to SDR express chronically high levels of TNF-
α, IL-6, and IL-1β. In contrast, DME resulted in significant
reductions in renal deposition of IgG and C3 as well as circulating
levels of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10, and CXCL1. Although exercise
is recognized for combating the stress and fatigue commonly
reported by patients with SLE (Ayán and Martín, 2007), IL-6 is
shown to increase immediately following acute bouts of exercise,
presumably via secretion from contracting skeletal muscle as a
myokine (Perandini et al., 2015). Our data displays a prolonged
suppression of IL-6; thus, while the acute response to exercise
may lead to an increase, the chronic influence is to suppress
this proinflammatory mediator. Furthermore, we observed a
significant increase in IL-6 levels with SDR in NZM2410/J mice
compared to non-stressed controls. In concordance, high levels
of circulating IL-6 are strongly associated with stress, depression,
and autoimmune disease (Rohleder et al., 2012). IL-10 has been
shown previously to be elevated in SLE and is known to have
an anti-inflammatory function by acting to inhibit macrophage
functions and T-cell proliferation; however, it is also known to
be proinflammatory by recruiting cytotoxic T cells (Santin et al.,
2000). While we did not observe a difference in IL-10 following
SDR, significant reductions were observed with DME. Since IL-
10 upregulation is also associated with disease progression in
NZM2410/J mice (Blenman et al., 2006), our data suggests that
the effects of SDR may be masked by prevailingly elevated IL-10,
whereas DME is effective in reducing these levels. Collectively,
these data suggest that DME and stress reduction may be effective
in combating the inflammatory disease pathology associated with
these cytokines.
Previous
studies
have
shown
correlations
between
mononuclear cell infiltration and poor disease outcome in
patients with LN (Hill et al., 2001). In addition to high levels
of antinuclear antibodies and immune complex formation,
levels of MCP-1 are also observed to increase with SLE flare
(Bauer et al., 2009). Furthermore, TNF-α is known to act
as a promotor for MCP-1 expression in humans as well as
mice (Ping et al., 1996; Hill et al., 2001; Bethunaickan et al.,
Frontiers in Physiology | www.frontiersin.org

 Aqel et al.
Effects of Exercise and Social Stress in Lupus
2014), which leads to macrophage migration and infiltration
(Deshmane et al., 2009). Since macrophage activation is
being increasingly associated with disease progression in
NZM2410/J mice (Bethunaickan et al., 2014) and our results
show a significant immunomodulatory influence of TNF-α and
macrophage infiltration with both DME and SDR, it is tempting
to speculate that regular exercise and stress modification impact
LN pathology via TNF-α regulation. Furthermore, our results
suggest that the TNF-α upregulation resulting from SDR may
lead to the induction of mononuclear cell infiltration by inducing
MCP-1
expression.
However,
pharmacological
suppression
of TNF-α is not used regularly in patients with SLE (Aringer
et al., 2012) despite several small studies demonstrating a
significant improvement in disease activity scores (SLEDAI) with
anti-TNF-α therapy (Zhu et al., 2010). While the reasoning to
explain why no large randomized trials have been conducted to
examine these observations is complex, one factor is the concern
over rising anti-dsDNA autoantibody levels in some patients
(Zhu et al., 2010). Considering that we observed a significant
influence of TNF-α with SDR and DME without an increase
in anti-dsDNA autoantibody levels, DME and psychological
stress management may be natural and more efficacious as
adjunct therapeutic strategies than pharmacologically inhibiting
TNF-α.
The process of inflammation requires substantial energy
expenditure, which has been demonstrated in animal studies
using transgenic mice targeting NF-κB, a key transcriptional
regulator of inflammatory signaling pathways (Tang et al., 2010).
Furthermore, recent work in humans has demonstrated that
physiological energy allocation is not additive with increasing
physical activity, but rather follows a constrained energy
expenditure model of distribution (Pontzer et al., 2016).
According to this hypothesis, if physical activity is introduced or
the system has other new energy demands, energy is re-allocated
from different areas in order to satisfy these additional burdens.
Considering the immunosuppressive influences observed by
DME in this study, the compensatory changes required to
maintain energy homeostasis may significantly impact the
energy allocation provided to fuel systemic inflammation.
In agreement, studies have shown that regular moderate
exercise leads to decreased susceptibility to infectious disease
(Nieman, 1997; Chubak et al., 2006). Therefore, by fine-
tuning energy expenditure through regular physical activity, it
may be possible to optimize immune system function. This
immuno-optimization may both permit sufficient eradication of
pathogenic challenges without producing clinical symptoms and
limit the inflammatory pathology produced by autoimmune-
mediated processes. Additionally, while food intake was not
monitored in this study, the effect that this could potentially
have on energy allocation is minimal considering the moderate
intensity of physical activity and ad libitum availability of chow
for mice.
The results of our study indicate that an ideal regimen
to determine the efficacy of moderate exercise and stress
management in improving disease outcomes through the
regulation/suppression
of
systemic
inflammation
should
incorporate both daily, moderate physical activity as well
as techniques to promote psychological stress management.
Accordingly, Tai Chi uses meditative exercise that incorporates
both moderate physical activities as well as stress reduction;
thus, may effectively translate in a study with lupus patients.
In a small pilot study “Stress Moderation Impacting Lupus
with Exercise (SMILE): influence of daily moderate exercise
and stress reduction by Tai Chi in lupus,” active SLE patients
were enrolled into a daily Tai Chi program, which emphasized
moderate exercise levels with meditative breathing to provide
daily
physical activity and stress reduction
(unpublished
observations).
Our
preliminary
data
indicate
that
daily
Tai Chi can potentially be an effective adjunct therapy to
compliment current pharmacological interventions. Future
investigations will expand SMILE study enrollment for a
large randomized trial and further examine the molecular
pathways regulated by SDR and DME in mice. Studies
to
better
characterize
these
pathways
may
be
especially
advantageous in patients where behavioral modifications to
alter psychological stress and physical activity levels may not be
feasible.
