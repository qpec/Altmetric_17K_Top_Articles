Abstract
Purpose—We previously reported that 12 mo of resistance training (RT, 2×/wk, N= 19) or jump 
training (JUMP, 3×/wk, N= 19) increased whole body and lumbar spine BMD and increased 
serum bone formation markers relative to resorption in physically active (≥4 hr/wk) men (mean 
age: 44 ± 2 y; median: 44 y) with osteopenia of the hip or spine. The purpose of this secondary 
analysis was to examine the effects of the RT or JUMP intervention on potential endocrine 
mediators of the exercise effects on bone, specifically IGF-I, PTH and sclerostin.
Methods—Fasting blood samples were collected after a 24-h period of no exercise at baseline 
and after 12 months of RT or JUMP. IGF-I, PTH and sclerostin were measured in serum by 
ELISA. The effects of RT or JUMP on IGF-I, PTH and sclerostin were evaluated using 2×2 
repeated measures ANOVA (time, group). This study was conducted in accordance with the 
Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the University of Missouri IRB.
Results—Sclerostin concentrations in serum significantly decreased and IGF-I significantly 
increased after 12 mo of RT or JUMP; while PTH remained unchanged.
Conclusion—The beneficial effects of long-term, progressive-intensity RT or JUMP on BMD in 
moderately active men with low bone mass are associated with decreased sclerostin and increased 
IGF-I.

 1. Introduction
1.1. Mechanical loading, osteocytes and Wnt/β-catenin signaling
Even after achievement of peak bone mass, the adult skeleton adapts to mechanical loading 
to maintain bone strength sufficient to prevent fracture [1–3]. Bone adaptation occurs only at 
skeletal sites subjected to high strains [4]. With increased mechanical loading, bone strength 
is increased via changes in bone mass, shape, microarchitecture or material properties [2] 
that, ultimately, are orchestrated by osteocytes [5]. Osteocytes act as mechanosensors and 
transduce mechanical signals (e.g., strain, fluid shear stress) into biochemical signals 
detected by osteoblasts and osteoclasts [5]. There is no unique pathway linking mechanical 
loading to bone (re)modeling; rather, multiple pathways that are responsive to various 
signals, including mechanical strain, participate in the adaptive response [6]. Currently, the 
Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is viewed as a dominant pathway in adaptation to 
mechanical loading [5, 7–11]. Osteocytes regulate Wnt/β-catenin signaling via secretion of 
sclerostin, which antagonizes Wnt signaling by binding low-density lipoprotein receptor-
related protein-5 and -6 [12]. In response to increased mechanical loading, osteocyte release 
of sclerostin decreases [2], enhancing Wnt/β-catenin signaling and its downstream effects [8, 
12, 13].
1.2. Local mechanotransduction is sensitive to hormonal context
The hormonal milieu can influence local control of bone adaptation to mechanical loading 
[6]. That is, systemic and paracrine hormonal factors modulate osteocyte 
mechanotransduction and osteoblast response, thereby influencing local bone re(modeling) 
at the site of augmented mechanical strain. For example, insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) 
plays an important role in the early stages of the osteoblast adaptive response to mechanical 
loading [14–17]. IGF-I is locally expressed in osteoblasts and osteocytes [18], but 
circulating IGF-I is increased by hepatic expression and IGF-I released from skeletal muscle 
has paracrine effects [19]. Systemic IGF-I stimulates bone formation in loaded bones, as 
evidenced by administration of exogenous IGF-I [20–22]. IGF-I produced by skeletal 
muscle localizes at the bone/muscle interface, and increases bone formation [23]. Likewise, 
parathyroid hormone (PTH) enhances the osteogenic response to mechanical loading [14]. 
Increased systemic PTH down-regulates sclerostin expression in bone [24, 25], thereby 
enhancing the reduction in sclerostin that occurs in response to mechanical loading and 
augmenting bone formation [6].
1.3. Mechansims by which exercise improves bone outcomes
Exercise increases bone mass and strength [26–28]. The increase mechanical strain exerted 
on the skeleton by gravitational- and joint-reaction forces (i.e., “impact” and “muscle-
contraction” forces) down-regulates osteocyte sclerostin expression, increases Wnt/β-catenin 
signaling and, therefore, osteoblast activity [2, 5]. In addition to mechanical loading, 
exercise causes changes in systemic and local hormone concentrations, which might 
facilitate local skeletal adaptation to increased mechanical loading [14]. For example, PTH 
released during exercise controls osteocyte gene expression [29], and PTH signaling is 
associated with increased bone formation and improved structural and material properties 
[29]. Exercise also increases circulating IGF-I, the source of which is the liver or

 extrahepatic tissues. In particular, in response to exercise, skeletal muscle releases 
“myokines,” including IGF-I, which can have systemic and local effects on other tissues, 
including bone [19, 23, 30]. The osteoblast response to endogenous IGF-I is dependent on 
mechanical strain, thus, IGF-I is needed to optimize response to exercise [14, 31].
1.4. Study objectives and hypotheses
Despite acceptance of Wnt/β-catenin signaling as the predominant pathway in bone 
adaptation to exercise, data supporting the role of osteocyte expression of sclerostin in the 
osteogenic response to exercise in humans are very limited. It is not feasible to examine 
exercise-induced changes in Wnt/β-catenin signaling in bone in humans. However, because 
osteocytes are the primary source of sclerostin, circulating sclerostin reflects bone sclerostin 
and is therefore a measurable component of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in human subjects. 
Measurement of circulating sclerostin, as well as hormones that might enhance the 
osteogenic response to exercise, would provide useful information on how bone adapts to 
exercise in humans. Thus, the objective of this secondary analysis was to examine changes 
in circulating sclerostin, IGF-I, and PTH after 12 months of resistance training (RT) or jump 
training (JUMP) that increased BMD in apparently healthy men with low bone mass [32]. 
Importantly, no study has determined if a long-term, progressive-intensity exercise 
intervention impacts sclerostin levels. We hypothesized that sclerostin would decrease and 
that IGF-I and PTH would increase after 12 months of either RT of JUMP.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1.Trial Design
This study was a secondary analysis of data collected from a 12-month randomized, parallel 
intervention clinical trial that examined the effects of either resistance training or high-
intensity jump training on BMD [32]. This study was conducted in accordance with the 
Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the University of Missouri IRB. Informed 
written consent was obtained from each study participant.
2.2. Participants
Apparently healthy, physically active (≥4 hours of leisure time physical activity/week for the 
past 24 months) men aged 25–60 years with low BMD of the lumbar spine or hip (>−2.5 SD 
T-score ≤ −1.0 SD) were eligible to participate in this study [32].
2.3. Study intervention
2.3.1. RT and JUMP exercise interventions—The RT and JUMP exercise 
interventions have been described in detail previously [32]. Briefly, the RT and JUMP 
interventions were designed to optimize the osteogenic response, and both used a 
progressive intensity design based on a 6-week cycle followed by a rest week; a total of 8 
cycles were completed. Subjects randomized to the JUMP intervention were required to 
attend 3 training sessions per week with a minimum of 24 hours between sessions. The 
JUMP intervention included different jump exercises that varied in intensity, direction, 
single- or double-leg; 40–100 jumps were performed per session, depending on the session 
intensity. Subjects randomized to the resistance training (RT) intervention were required to

 complete 2 training sessions per week. The RT intervention included exercises that load the 
hip and spine: squats, bent-over-row, modified dead lift, military press, lunges, and calf 
raises. All training sessions were supervised by study personnel and were performed in 
McKee Gym Fitness Center. Participants were required to complete all training sessions. If a 
participant missed a scheduled training session (e.g., due to illness), he was required to make 
up the missed session. All participants were provided supplemental calcium (1200 mg 
calcium carbonate/d) and vitamin D (10 µg vitamin D3/d) (Nature Made, Mission Hills, CA, 
USA) to ensure adequate intake of these nutrients by all participants.
2.4. Outcomes
2.4.2. Blood collection and processing—Blood samples (15 mL) were collected from 
subjects at 0 and 12 months at the same time between 06:00 and 08:00 AM after an 
overnight fast and a 24-hour period of no exercise. All samples were allowed to clot at room 
temperature for 30 minutes as recommended [33] and then were centrifuged at 4°C for 15 
min at 2000g in a Marathon 21000R centrifuge (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) for 
isolation of serum. The separated serum was transferred to cryogenic vials and stored at 
−80°C for subsequent analysis.
2.4.3. IGF-I, PTH, and sclerostin assays—All assays were performed in duplicate 
measurements and in a single run to eliminate inter-assay variability. Commercially 
available ELISA analysis kits were used to determine the serum concentrations of IGF-I, 
PTH, and sclerostin. The sclerostin and PTH ELISA kits were purchased from ALPCO 
Diagnostics (Salem, NH, USA) and had intra-assay CVs of 5.1 and 5.5%, respectively; the 
IGF-I ELISA kit was purchased from AssayPro (Saint Louis, MO, USA) and had an intra-
assay CV of 4.1%. The normal ranges provided by manufacturers were as follows: sclerostin 
(median for healthy adults=24.14 pmol/l); IGF-I (30–300 ng/ml); PTH (9–94 pg/ml).
2.5. Statistical Analysis
2.5.1. Descriptive and hypothesis-testing statistics—Descriptive statistics were 
performed on demographic and anthropometric variables. Differences between RT and 
JUMP at baseline were evaluated using independent t-tests (2-tailed). A 2×2 repeated 
measures ANOVA (2 timepoints and 2 treatment groups) was employed to compare the 
effects of RT versus JUMP on serum concentrations of sclerostin, PTH and IGF-I. In the 
case of a significant interaction (p<0.1), a repeated measures one-way ANOVA within group 
was used to locate the interaction; within group changes over time were not examined unless 
the interaction was significant. Group means and least squared means were considered 
statistically different at p < 0.05, as determined by the protected least significant difference 
(LSD) technique. Pearson’s correlation was used to determine if there were significant 
associations between percent change in sclerostin, IGF-I, 25OH vitamin D, PTH, and 
previously reported changes in whole body, total hip and lumbar spine BMD. All statistical 
analyses were performed using the SPSS statistical package (SPSS/22.0, SPSS, Chicago, IL, 
USA). Data are presented as means (± SD).

 3. Results
3.1. Participant baseline characteristics
Thirty-eight participants completed the 12-month intervention and were included in the 
statistical analysis (Table 1). Participants were apparently health men who ranged in age 
from 25–60 y (median: 43.5 y; mean ± SD: 43.7 ± 10.1 y). There were no differences in age, 
anthropometric characteristics, nutrient intakes or physical activity between RT and JUMP at 
baseline [32].
3.2. Bone mineral density
As previously reported, whole body and LS BMD were significantly increased after six 
months of RT or JUMP relative to baseline and these increases were maintained at 12 
months (Table 2). Total hip BMD was significantly increased at 6 and 12 months only by RT 
and not by JUMP [32].
3.3. Pre- to post-intervention changes in sclerostin, PTH, IGF-I
There was a significant time main effect for serum sclerostin (p=0.012), such that sclerostin 
decreased ~7% from 39.2 ± 11.6 pmol/L at baseline to 36.8 ± 13.3 pmol/L after 12 months 
of RT or JUMP (Figure 1). Mean percent change from baseline for sclerostin was −4.5 
± 3.6% for JUMP and −9.5 ± 3.5% for RT; these changes were significantly different from 
zero (p<0.05), but did not differ between groups. IGF-I increased ~26% from 203 ± 71 
ng/mL to 239 ± 109 ng/mL after 12 months of RT or JUMP (time main effect, p=0.036; 
Figure 1). Mean percent change from baseline for IGF-I was 24.9 ± 11.6% for JUMP and 
27.5 ± 13.3% for RT; these changes were significantly different from zero (p<0.01), but 
were not different between groups. PTH remained unchanged from baseline to 12 months. 
Sclerostin, IGF-I and PTH concentrations were within the normal range, as expected in 
apparently health men.
3.4. Associations between percent changes in hormonal outcomes and BMD
We previously reported that 25-OH vitamin D (25OHD) increased by 10.6 ± 4.0% after 12 
months of daily supplementation with 10 µg vitamin D3. Changes in 25OHD were not 
significantly associated with changes in sclerostin or PTH, but there was a significant 
positive association between percent changes in 25OHD and IGF-I (r=0.502, p<0.001). 
Percent changes in whole body, total hip and lumbar spine BMD were not associated percent 
changes in sclerostin, IGF-I or PTH.
4. Discussion
4.1. Synopsis of study results
Serum sclerostin decreased significantly and IGF-I increased, while PTH was not changed 
after 12 months of RT or JUMP that increased BMD in apparently healthy men with low 
bone mass at baseline [32].

 4.2. Sclerostin
The decrease in sclerostin observed following long-term RT or JUMP that increased BMD is 
consistent with the key role of osteocyte expression of sclerostin and the Wnt/β-catenin 
signaling pathway in the response to mechanical loading. A practical limitation of human 
studies is that it is not feasible to examine changes in osteocyte expression of sclerostin. 
However, because osteocytes are the primary source of sclerostin [5], the sclerostin in 
circulation is derived from osteocytes and should reflect bone levels. This was confirmed by 
Drake et al who reported a strong positive correlation between circulating serum sclerostin 
and bone marrow plasma sclerostin [24].
Very few studies have examined the relationship between exercise-associated mechanical 
loading and sclerostin in humans. Of the existing studies, most either made cross-sectional 
comparisons based on type or amount of physical activity [34–36] or evaluated acute 
changes in circulating sclerostin associated with intense, long-duration endurance exercise 
[37, 38]. Because osteocyte expression of sclerostin is responsive to multiple signals, 
conclusions about the role of sclerostin in the skeletal response to mechanical loading are 
often confounded by age, sex, and energy status [39] in cross-sectional comparisons. The 
acute sclerostin response to high-intensity, long-duration athletic competition, such as an 
ultra-marathon or cycling stage race, has similar limitations, as participation in these events 
can result in altered body mass, energy balance, and calcium status all of which might affect 
sclerostin release. Grasso reported that serum sclerostin increased after participation in a 3-
week cycling stage race relative to baseline, and postulated that osteocytes increased 
sclerostin expression in response to high muscular workloads in the absence of gravitational 
load as occurs in cycling [37]. In contrast, sclerostin did not change from pre-ultra marathon 
to immediately post-race, but was significantly reduced 3 days after the race [38]. These 
acute changes in sclerostin reflect the osteocyte integration of multiple mechanical, 
hormonal, and metabolic inputs.
We could identify only two long-term, controlled exercise interventions studies that 
examined changes in circulating sclerostin from pre- to post-exercise in the literature. 
Twelve months of a physical activity intervention that increased hip, but not lumbar spine, 
BMD in postmenopausal women had no effect on serum sclerostin at completion of the 
intervention [40]. However, it is possible that sclerostin might have increased earlier during 
the training program. The training program provided a constant training stimulus for the 
duration of the 12-month intervention. Because bone responds to novel and unusual 
mechanical strain, after 12 months of the intervention, osteocytes might have no longer been 
responsive to the exercise. Armamento-Villareal examined the osteoprotective effects of 
exercise during 12 months of moderate weight loss (~10% of initial body weight) via caloric 
restriction in obese, older adults [41]. Weight reduction increased serum sclerostin by ~10% 
with concurrent reductions in hip BMD and geometry (e.g., cortical thickness, cross-
sectional area) in obese older adults. Participants who exercised during caloric restriction 
also lost ~10% of their baseline body weight, but were protected against deleterious changes 
in hip geometry and did not increase serum sclerostin. Interestingly, participants who 
performed the same exercise, but maintained body weight, did not show any changes in hip 
outcomes or sclerostin [41].

 In the present study, the first to examine sclerostin levels following a progressive intensity 
exercise intervention, we observed an average 7% decrease in serum sclerostin from pre-
intervention to completion of the 12-month intervention. Data from the exercise intervention 
study by Armamento-Villareal [41] and a bed-rest study by Spatz [42] provide context for 
the biological significance of the 7% decrease we observed. After a 12-month weight loss 
intervention, serum sclerostin increased ~10% with a concurrent ~2–3% decrease in hip 
BMD [41]. In a 60-day bed rest study, sclerostin increased by ~20%, beginning ~2–3 weeks 
after the onset of bed rest, and BMD of the lower extremities (legs, hips) declined by ~2–4% 
[42]. Thus, the decrease in sclerostin that we observed after 12 months of osteogenic 
exercise was similar in magnitude to previously reported changes in sclerostin in response to 
increased or decreased mechanical loading.
4.3. IGF-I
In the present study, IGF-I increased by an average of 26% after 12 months of RT or JUMP 
in men with low bone mass, consistent with previous studies. Generally, resistance exercise 
training increases systemic IGF-I concentrations and this response is more robust and 
consistent in young, rather than aged, individuals [43]. The relative importance of bone-
derived versus systemic IGF-I to bone health remains unresolved. Serum IGF-I is positively 
associated with BMD in humans and [44, 45] experimental animals [46, 47], and there is a 
negative association between circulating IGF-I and future fracture in adult women [48, 49]. 
Thus, the human data support the importance of serum IGF-I to bone health. Data from 
experimental animals provide stronger evidence for this relationship. Genetically modified 
animals that do not make IGF-I in the liver have significantly reduced cortical bone volume, 
periosteal circumference, and cross-sectional area [50, 51]. Thus, in vivo animal models 
demonstrate that systemic IGF-I is necessary for bone modeling (net gain) and 
mineralization [52].
4.4. PTH
Resting PTH concentrations were not affected by long-term RT or JUMP training in men 
with low bone mass. PTH increases during exercise, transiently decreases relative to pre-
exercise, and returns to baseline values ~24 hours post-exercise [53]. Regular exercise that 
produces short-lived increases in PTH may stimulate bone formation, in a manner analogous 
to intermittent administration of exogenous PTH, which is the only approved bone-anabolic 
treatment for low bone mass [54]. We previously reported that the decrease in PTH 
following one session of RT or JUMP used in present study was positively correlated with 
decrease in TRAP5b [53]. Although we did not observe an increase in resting PTH after 12 
months of osteogenic exercise, each session might have induced transient changes.
5. Conclusions
In summary, this is the first study to show that an exercise intervention that modulates 
intensity over time decreases circulating sclerostin along with increases in bone mineral 
density. Of note, either mode of exercise—resistance training or jump training—both 
increased bone mass and decreased sclerostin. These results are consistent with osteocyte 
expression of sclerostin in translating the mechanical stimulus of exercise into increased

 bone mass in humans. In addition, long-term exercise is associated with increased 
circulating IGF-I, which may enhance local skeletal response at sites of increase mechanical 
load. From a practical perspective, strategies, such as nutrition, that increase IGF-I or other 
bone anabolic hormones (e.g., estrogen), might enhance response to exercise.
