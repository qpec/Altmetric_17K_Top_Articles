Abstract
Background: Hypertension drives the global burden of cardiovascular disease and its prevalence is estimated to increase by 30%
by the year 2025. Nonadherence to chronic medication regimens is common; approximately 43% to 65.5% of patients who fail to
adhere to prescribed regimens are hypertensive patients. Nonadherence to medications is a potential contributing factor to the
occurrence of concomitant diseases.
Objective: This systematic review applied a meta-analytic procedure to investigate the medication nonadherence in adult
hypertensive patients.
Methods: Original research studies, conducted on adult hypertensive patients, using the 8-item Morisky medication adherence
scale (MMAS-8) to assess the medication adherence between January 2009 and March 2016 were included. Comprehensive search
strategies of 3 databases and MeSH keywords were used to locate eligible literature. Study characteristics, participant
demographics, and medication adherence outcomes were recorded. Effect sizes for outcomes were calculated as standardized
mean differences using random-effect model to estimate overall mean effects.
Results: A total of 28 studies from 15 countries were identified, in total comprising of 13,688 hypertensive patients, were reviewed.
Of25studiesincludedinthemeta-analysisinvolving12,603subjects,asignificantnumber(45.2%)ofthehypertensivepatientsandone-third
(31.2%) of the hypertensive patients with comorbidities were nonadherent to medications. However, a higher proportion (83.7%) of
medication nonadherence was noticed in uncontrolled blood pressure (BP) patients. Although a higher percentage (54%) of nonadherence
toantihypertensivemedicationswasnoticedinfemales(P<0.001),theriskofnonadherencewas1.3timeshigherinmales,witharelativerisk
of 0.883. Overall, nearly two-thirds (62.5%) of the medication nonadherence was noticed in Africans and Asians (43.5%).
Conclusion: Nonadherence to antihypertensive medications was noticed in 45% of the subjects studied and a higher proportion of
uncontrolled BP (83.7%) was nonadherent to medication. Intervention models aiming to improve adherence should be emphasized.

1. Introduction
Hypertension is prevalent and remains one of the most significant
causes of mortality worldwide. Elevated blood pressure (BP) is a
major risk factor for coronary artery disease and its complica-
tions, heart failure, stroke, renal insufficiency, and blindness in
diabetic patients. The Global Burden of Disease study estimated
that hypertension is now the leading risk factor for disability-
adjusted
life
years
worldwide.[1]
The
risk
of
developing
hypertension can be reduced by effective medication therapy
management and significant lifestyle modifications. Adherence to
antihypertensive medications is the cornerstone for achieving
hypertension control.
Nonadherence to medication is a growing concern and is
associated with adverse outcomes. Maintaining medication
adherence to multiple medications is a complex issue in patients
with chronic diseases, particularly cardiovasculardiseases (CVDs).
The influence of nonadherence to antihypertensive medications is
the most important cause of uncontrolled BP. Consequently,
because of nonadherence, most (nearly 3-quarters) of the
hypertensive patients do not achieve optimal BP control.[2]
Several approaches were tried to investigate the medication-
taking behavior and the traditional methods such as pill counts,
clinical reports, prescription refills and patient-reported measures

 are some of the cheap and acceptable ones to provide medication
adherence information. However, self-reported questionnaires
were often used to assess the medication adherence in chronic
disease patients. Several self-reported validated questionnaires
were developed to monitor medication adherence in chronic
disease patients including hypertension patients. Some of the
scales suitable for measuring adherence in hypertension patients
include Morisky medication adherence scale-8 (MMAS-8),[3]
Brief Medication Questionnaire by Svarstad et al,[4] the Hill-Bone
Compliance scale,[5] and the most recent Adherence scale by
Culig et al.[6] Of these, MMAS-8 remains the best known and
most widely used scale for investigating medication adherence in
hypertensive patients. To date, there has been no systematic
review or meta-analysis conducted to estimate the nonadherence
status in hypertensive patients using any of the above-mentioned
self-reported scales. Therefore, a better understanding of these
issues could help to tailor effective interventions and strategies to
improve the medication adherence in hypertensive patients. In
order to gather the data from all the available literature that
evaluated the adherence to antihypertensive medications using
MMAS-8, we aimed to perform a systematic review and meta-
analysis to synthesize medication nonadherence in hypertensive
patients.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Search strategies
A computerized systematic search of the PubMed, Scopus, and
Google Scholar using the Cochrane guidelines to conduct the
meta-analysis following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic review and Meta-Analysis) statement was used
(Appendix 1, https://figshare.com/s/5c111733cd4185c2362a).

∗ AND using patients self-
reported questionnaire. All the papers that were published in the
English language between January 2009 and March 2016 were
included. The review was limited to self-reported studies that
were conducted using MMAS-8 validated questionnaire admin-
istered to the hypertensive patients using antihypertensive
medications.
2.2. Inclusion criteria
We included studies that met the following inclusion criteria:
Study used the MMAS-8 questionnaire on hypertensive patients
to assess the adherence levels to antihypertensive medications;
the study was an original article; and studies conducted on
hypertensive patients.
2.3. Exclusion criteria
We excluded studies that used the MMAS-8 scale on other than
hypertensive patients using antihypertensive medications, the
subjects included other CVDs and diabetic patients and the
studies using MMAS-4 scale.
2.4. Review process
All records that were identified from searches of the electronic
databases were loaded into the ENDNOTE software version X5
(Thomson Reuters, Toronto, Ontario, Canada) and duplicates
were removed. Two researchers (TMA and ASB) independently
screened the titles and abstracts to identify the potentially eligible
studies. Studies that were potentially eligible were selected for
full-text review (Flow of information). Disagreement was
resolved by mutual consent after discussion.
2.5. Data extraction
Information on the year of the execution of the study, the
geographic location, the sample size, the way of administration of
the questionnaire, and data about the nonadherence toward
antihypertensive
medication
were
retrieved.
In
particular,
MMAS-8 statements that grouped answers that were scored
<6 were considered as nonadherence outcomes for the meta-
analysis.
2.6. Statistical analysis
The meta-analysis was performed using StatsDirect statistical
software version 3.0 (Cheshire, UK). The Cochrane Q and the I2
were used to evaluate heterogeneity of studies. Random-effects
model was used to combine studies showing heterogeneity of
Cochrane Q P<0.10 and I2>50.[7] Strengthening the Reporting
of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) scale was
used to assess the quality of the studies by categorizing into high
quality (≥75% of the STROBE checklist) and low quality (<75%
of the STROBE checklist).[8] We performed subgroup analysis by
gender and studies carried out in different continents. Moreover,
Egger and Begg tests representing funnel plots were used to assess
the publication bias.
2.7. Ethical statement
This study was carried out in strict accordance with the
recommendations in the STROBE and PRISMA guidelines.
Ethics committee or institutional review board permission is not
required for conducting systematic review and meta-analysis.
3. Results
A total of 912 articles were screened from the 3 scientific
databases (PubMed=380, Scopus=312, and Google Scholar=
220). After screening the abstracts and titles, 852 were excluded
because of irrelevance and duplicates. Sixty articles were assessed
for full-text review and 32 articles were excluded with reasons
(Suppl 2, http://links.lww.com/MD/B539). Finally, 28 articles
were included in the systematic review[9–36] and 25 of these were
included in the meta-analysis.[9,11–25,27–31,33–36]
3.1. Characteristics of studies assessed
In total, 13,688 subjects were included in the analyzed studies.
Nine

Nigeria,[16,22] Hong Kong,[21,25] and Iran.[10,18] Countries such
as Uganda, Lebanon, Kenya, Republic of Korea, Peru, Ethiopia,
Ghana, Malaysia, Palestine, Brazil, and Italy were represented
with a single study.[9,13,19,20,23,24,27,28,31,34,36] These studies
were conducted on hypertensive patients to assess medication
adherence using MMAS-8 between January 2009 and March
2016. Twenty-four studies were cross-sectional[9–27] and others
were cohort,[35] observational,[36] and interventional studies.[32]
Only 1 randomized controlled trial (RCT) was found.[29] The

 sample size of studies ranged from 25[32] to 2445[21] subjects.
Eleven
studies
assessed
adherence
through
face-to-face
interviews,[10,14,18,20,22–24,26,29–31] while 8 studies used self-
administered questionnaires,[13,17,21,25,32–34,36] and only 1 study
was administered through a telephone interview.[35] However,
8 studies did not specify the type of MMAS-8 questionnaire
administered.[9,11,12,15,16,19,27,28] Except 1 study,[22] all the
included studies met the quality criteria and showed high quality
(>75%).[9–27,29–36]
3.2. Baseline characteristics of study subjects
The baseline characteristics of 28 studies are presented in Table 1.
Among these hypertensive patients, the majority were females
(n=7859, 57.4%); 34% had comorbidities (n=4661) and/or
uncontrolled hypertension (n=2606, 19%).
3.3. Nonadherence to antihypertensive medications
We identified a total of 25 studies (n=12,628) that used MMAS-
8 to assess the medication adherence in hypertensive patients.
Overall, nonadherence to antihypertensive medications was
45.2% (95% confidence interval [CI]=34.4–56.1, P<0.001)
(Fig. 1).
3.4. Nonadherence in hypertensive patients with
comorbidities
Ten studies, with a total of 6836 subjects, reported the
medication adherence levels in hypertensive patients with
comorbidities. Overall, the nonadherence to antihypertensive
medications
was
significant
in
hypertensive
patients
with
comorbidities: 31.6% (95% CI=10.2–97.5), P=0.045; hetero-
geneity I2=99.1% (Fig. 2).
3.5. Nonadherence in uncontrolled hypertension patients
We identified 10 studies (n=4574) that reported the medication
adherence levels in uncontrolled and controlled hypertension
patients. Compared to controlled hypertensive patients (n=
1973) (59.7% [95% CI=37.7–81.7]), nonadherence in uncon-
trolled hypertensive patients (n=2606) was 83.7% (95%
CI=59.9–117.0), but no statistical significance was noticed
(P=0.2991); heterogeneity I2=86.2% (Fig. 3).
3.6. Subgroup analysis
To investigate the potential discrepancy, the results of 25 studies
were stratified by gender with regard to nonadherence to
antihypertensive medications using a random model. Overall, the
risk of nonadherence to antihypertensive medications was 1.3
times (95% CI=0.99–1.74, P=0.058) higher in male hyperten-
sive
patients
than
females
(odds
ratio=0.73,
95%
CI=
0.56–0.93) with a relative risk of 0.883 (95% CI=0.76–1.02),
P=0.104 (Fig. 4). Indeed, in the subgroup analysis, the
percentage of nonadherence to antihypertensive medications
was higher in females: 53.9% (95% CI=49.7–57.9), P<0.001
than males: 46.2% (95% CI=42.2–50.2), P=0.020.
3.7. Sensitivity analysis stratified for different continents
Sensitivity analysis was carried out where the studies were
conducted in different continents. Studies carried out in Africa
(6 studies; n=1277) (62.5% [95% CI=39.9–85.0]; P<0.001)
and Asia (8 studies; n=5917) (43.5% [95% CI=35.0–53.0];
P<0.001) showed a higher proportion of nonadherence to
antihypertensive medications than American studies (9 studies;
n=4982) (36.6% [95% CI=24.4–48.8], P<0.001)and Europe-
an studies (2 studies; n=452) (37.1% [95% CI=32.7–41.6],
P<0.001).
3.8. Publication bias
Publication bias was not highlighted in all the analysis and
confirmed by the Egger and Begg tests showed funnel plots.
4. Discussion
Several epidemiological studies about medication adherence in
hypertensive patients using MMAS-8 were conducted in recent
years, making it possible to obtain direct evidence of the
nonadherence situation of hypertensive patients. Based on the
strict inclusion criteria, we reviewed 28 studies that assessed
the antihypertensive medication adherence, we included 25
articles in this meta-analysis including 12,603 subjects, covering
15 countries and different provinces, thus the large population
guaranteed the reliability of this study.
Using a systematic review, we aimed to gather different studies
published between January 2009 and March 2016 that assessed
medication adherence in hypertensive patients using MMAS-8.
To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review on this topic.
Previous reviews were focused on beliefs and hypertension
treatment,[37]
nonadherence
in
resistant
hypertension
patients,[38] and medication compliance in resistant hypertension
patients.[39]
4.1. Strengths and limitations
The strengths of this paper consisted of execution of non-
adherence to antihypertensive medications by including 25
studies in meta-analysis. This has helped us gather and strengthen
the combination of each study findings to obtain pooled
prevalence provided stronger evidence about medication non-
adherence in hypertensive patients. In addition, the analysis
conducted on 5 different outcomes showed interesting results.
However, our search strategy was comprehensive, included
research articles using MMAS-8 questionnaire, conducted on
hypertensive patients and studies published in English language.
4.2. Summary of study findings
Through this study, we identified that a significant number
(45.2%) of the hypertensive patients are nonadherent to
antihypertensive medications and nearly one-third (31.2%) of
hypertensive patients with various comorbidities showed non-
adherence to medications. Interestingly, a higher proportion
(83.7%) of uncontrolled hypertensive patients was nonadherent
to
medications.
Although
a
higher
percentage
(54%)
of
nonadherence to antihypertensive medications was noticed in
females (P<0.001), the risk of nonadherence was 1.3 times
higher in males, with a relative risk of 0.883. Overall, nearly two-
thirds (62.5%) of the medication nonadherence was noticed in
Africans and Asians (43.5%).
The findings of our review pointed out that the lack of
medication adherence in hypertensive patients is a significant
concern. “For instance, nearly half (45%) of the hypertensive

 population studied are nonadherent to antihypertensive medi-
cations.” This is comparably similar with Carrea et al study
findings (57%) assessed the antihypertensive medication adher-
ence using MMAS-8 items and urine fluorescence in resistant
hypertensive patients.[40] Nonadherence to pharmacological
agents in hypertensive patients has a negative impact and
increases the risk of cardiovascular events and stroke. Medication
nonadherence is multifactorial, several studies have demonstrat-
ed the association between nonadherence and patients’ beliefs,
socioeconomic
status,
health
literacy,
race/ethnicity,
and
others.[37,41–45] Early identification of patients’ barriers by
sharing the concerns with health professionals can help improve
adherence, reduce costs, optimize drug therapy, and achieve BP
control. However, several interventions were extensively tried to
improve the adherence, it is notable that these interventions
focused only on implementation of medication adherence for BP
control. Future investigations should explore the potential
benefits of tailoring patient-specific interventions, implementa-
tion adherence versus persistence outcomes, and the preferences
for interventional delivery (e.g., face-to-face vs technology-
mediated). These interventions were also confirmed by Conn et al
review.[46]
BP lowering in hypertensive patients with comorbidities is
significantly important in reducing vascular risk such as CVDs,
coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, diabetes, heart failure, and
chronic kidney disease. However, a few studies identified
hypertensive patients with comorbidities and the number of
medications prescribed are the 2 significant factors associated
with poor adherence.[45,47,48] In contrast, our findings showed
that only one-third (31.2%) of hypertensive patients with
comorbidities showed nonadherence to antihypertensive medi-
cations and was not strongly associated for nonadherence (P=
0.045). Evidence from the recent meta-analysis suggests that a 10
mm Hg reduction in systolic BP in hypertensive patients reduces
the risk of major CVD events by 20%, CHDs by 17%, stroke by
27%, heart failure by 28%, and all-cause mortality by 13%.[49]
This highlights the protective effects of pharmacologically
induced BP reduction in hypertensive patients with comorbid-
ities. Despite this, identifying best approach to reduce BP in
hypertensive patients with comorbidities remains controversial.[50]
Uncontrolled systolic and diastolic BPs are important risk
factors for increased cerebrovascular events, cardiovascular
events, and all-cause mortality. Studies estimated that more
than 50% of the uncontrolled hypertensive patients have
suboptimal adherence.[51] Through our investigation we identi-
fied an alarming levels of nonadherence to antihypertensive
medications in uncontrolled BP patients (83.7% [95% CI=
59.9–117.0]) than controlled BP patients (59.7% [95% CI=
37.7–81.7]). These results were comparably much higher than de
Oliveira-Filho et al study assessed the medication adherence
using MMAS-8 showed nearly two-thirds (62.4%) of the
uncontrolled BP patients are nonadherent to antihypertensive
medications.[52] In order to improve their medication adherence,
practitioners need to focus on treatment targets and pharmacists
should spend more time to adequately counsel about treatment
and comprehensively discuss the advantages of lifestyle mod-
ifications in uncontrolled BP patients (but also controlled BP
patients).
Antihypertensive medication adherence can vary substantially
between individuals, identification of sex differences for non-
adherence could assist the healthcare providers to customize
an
effective
intervention.

 medications is 1.3 times higher in male than in female patients,
with a relative risk of 0.883 (95% CI=0.76–1.02), P=0.104.
However, the percentage of nonadherence was noticeably higher
in females than in males (53.9% vs 46.2%). These results were
much higher than Holt et al study conducted on older adult
hypertensive patients using MMAS-8, where a higher percentage
of women had low adherence scores compared to men (15% vs
13.1%).[53] In accordance with previous studies, no differences in
low medication adherence was noticed between men and women
in CoSMO study.[54] Further research is needed to better
understand the underlying and modified risk factors associated
with nonadherence between the sexes.

 patients. In particular, studies carried out in Africa showed a
higher percentage of nonadherence levels (62.4%) than Asians
(43.5%), Europeans (36.6%), and Americans (36.6%). These
findings were consistent with studies conducted in African
countries such as Ivory Coast (87.5%), Togo (83.7%), Congo
(78.8%), and Tunisia (63.4%).[55–58]These oceanic discrepancies
may be due to differences in the populations studied, ethnic/race
differences,

4.3. Limitations
The overall quality of the included studies was high, especially
given that more than 90% of the studies were assessed as low risk
of sampling bias. High level of heterogeneity was noticed across
the included studies was one of the limitations of our study. A
substantial proportion of the heterogeneity across studies could
be due to differences in the population characteristics, sociocul-
tural variations, and study methodologies. In addition, we used

 only validated and commonly used MMAS-8 questionnaire
administered to hypertensive patients in all studies to prevent
selection bias. Quality assessment and stratification of the quality
and geographic criteria have allowed the evaluation of the
presence of potential bias and confounders. Further, we may have
missed some potentially relevant studies; however, this systematic
review arguably constitutes the largest study on nonadherence to
antihypertensive medications comprising >13,000 participants.
5. Conclusion
This comprehensive meta-analysis of nonadherence to antihy-
pertensive medication documented a significantly higher propor-
tion (45.2%) of medication nonadherence was noticed among
hypertensive patients, particularly uncontrolled BP patients
(83.7%). There is a need for tailoring interventions by linking
adherence behavior with daily habits, developing patient-specific
interventions, providing motivational interviews, and actively
engaging family members to improve the antihypertensive
medication adherence. Future research should explore alternative
techniques to assess and monitor the medication adherence
program particularly for older adult hypertensive patients.
