ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND Although guideline-recommended therapies reduce major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in
patients after myocardial infarction (MI) or those with atherosclerotic disease (ATH), adherence is poor.
OBJECTIVES The goal of this study was to determine the association between medication adherence levels and
long-term MACE in these patients.
METHODS We queried the claims database of a large health insurer for patients hospitalized for MI or with ATH. The
primary outcome measure was a composite of all-cause death, MI, stroke, or coronary revascularization. Using proportion
of days covered for statins and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, patients were stratified as fully adherent
($80%), partially adherent ($40% to #79%), or nonadherent (<40%). Per-patient annual direct medical (ADM) costs
were estimated by using unit costs from 2 national files.
RESULTS Data were analyzed for 4,015 post-MI patients and 12,976 patients with ATH. In the post-MI cohort, the fully
adherent group had a significantly lower rate of MACE than the nonadherent (18.9% vs. 26.3%; hazard ratio [HR]: 0.73;
p ¼ 0.0004) and partially adherent (18.9% vs. 24.7%; HR: 0.81; p ¼ 0.02) groups at 2 years. The fully adherent group
had reduced per-patient ADM costs for MI hospitalizations of $369 and $440 compared with the partially adherent and
nonadherent groups, respectively. In the ATH cohort, the fully adherent group had a significantly lower rate of MACE
than the nonadherent (8.42% vs. 17.17%; HR: 0.56; p < 0.0001) and the partially adherent (8.42% vs. 12.18%; HR: 0.76;
p < 0.0001) groups at 2 years. The fully adherent group had reduced per-patient ADM costs for MI hospitalizations of
$371 and $907 compared with the partially adherent and nonadherent groups.
CONCLUSIONS Full adherence to guideline-recommended therapies was associated with a lower rate of MACE and
cost savings, with a threshold effect at >80% adherence in the post-MI population; at least a 40% level of long-term
adherence needs to be maintained to continue to accrue benefit. Novel approaches to improve adherence may signifi-
cantly reduce cardiovascular events. (J Am Coll Cardiol 2016;68:789–801) © 2016 by the American College of

t is estimated that there are 83.6 million patients
in the United States with established atheroscle-
rotic (coronary, cerebrovascular, and peripheral
artery)
disease
(1).
Furthermore,
approximately
735,000 Americans experience a myocardial infarc-
tion (MI) every year, and 210,000 have a recurrent
event (2). The use of evidence-based and guideline-
recommended medications for the secondary preven-
tion of cardiovascular (CV) disease was estimated to
be responsible for one-half of the overall 50% reduc-
tion in mortality from CV disease observed over
the past 2 decades (3). Amazingly, this substantial

 reduction in mortality has been achieved
despite patients not receiving proven medi-
cal therapies to the fullest extent, with nearly
one-half of the patients being nonadherent
with their prescribed regimen 2 years after
experiencing a CV event (4). In the longer
term, for patients with documented athero-
sclerosis, medication adherence is <50% (5).
The potential for further improvement in
CV outcomes through improved medication
adherence is therefore a tantalizing prospect.
Improved outcomes will also have a direct
impact on the immense financial burden
associated with CV disease.
Although nonadherence with evidence-based sec-
ondary prevention medications is common in pa-
tients
with
established
atherosclerotic
disease,
studies on long-term outcomes are limited. The goal
of the present paper was to study the association
between levels of medication adherence and long-
term major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE),
resource utilization, and cost differences in an acute
post-MI cohort and in a complementary chronic
atherosclerosis cohort using a large U.S.-based health
insurance database.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
DATA
SOURCE. This non-concurrent cohort study
was conducted by using 2010 to 2013 medical and
pharmaceutical claims obtained from Aetna Commer-
cial and Medicare Advantage population databases.
These databases consist of enrollment records from a
large, geographically diverse, insured population.
These records were linked, allowing for comprehen-
sive tracking of patients’ use of health care resources
and clinical outcomes over time and across providers.
Enrollment files contain individualized demographic
and health insurance plan characteristics, such as age,
sex, geographic region, type of health insurance plan,
and
enrollment
status.
Medical
claims
included
detailed information about inpatient and outpatient
care, including date and place of service diagnosis
codes according to the International Classification of
Diseases (ICD)-Ninth Revision-Clinical Modification,
and procedure codes, such as those from Current
Procedural Terminology, Fourth Edition. Pharmacy
claims files included information on National Drug
Code, dispense date, quantity dispensed and supplied,
and
copayment
amounts.
In
addition,
Symmetry
episode risk group scores (Ingenix, Inc., Eden Prairie,
Minnesota;
2008
proprietary
risk
prediction
algorithm), publicly available data from the U.S.
Census 2010 file, and self-reported multisource race/
ethnicity data were included in the analysis. For the
cost data, 2 separate, federally funded and nationally
representative cost databases were analyzed: the
Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project and the Medi-
care files (Medicare Physician Fee Schedule and
Medicare Outpatient Prospective Payment System).
We also performed a sensitivity analysis of the results
by using simple average unit costs for stroke, MI,
atherosclerosis
or
angina,
revascularization
pro-
cedures, and CV test categories.
STUDY POPULATION. The post-MI cohort included
adults who initiated both statin and angiotensin-
converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor medications after
a hospitalization discharge for MI according to ICD
codes 410.x (excluding codes when the fifth digit was
2) and 411.1 with a length of stay of >2 days, between
January 1, 2010, and February 28, 2013. Patients were
included in the cohort if they had continuous eligi-
bility for both medical and prescription drug benefits
from Aetna during 6 months before and after the MI.
The discharge date of the MI hospitalization was
identified as the index date.
The atherosclerosis cohort included adults who
initiated both statin and ACE inhibitor medications
and also had 2 coronary, cerebrovascular, or peripheral
artery disease ICD codes (claims) within 1 category or a
revascularization code between January 1, 2010, and
December 31, 2010. Patients were included in the
cohort if they had continuous eligibility for both
medical and prescription drug benefits from Aetna
from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2011. The first
statin and ACE inhibitor refill during 2010 was identi-
fied as the index date. For both cohorts, an “out-of-
hospital” first medication fill during the period of
interest was considered as an inclusion requirement.
Members were excluded from both cohorts if they
met any of the following criteria: pregnancy; patients
with diagnosis codes indicating psychoses, dementia,
bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder (severe
with
psychotic
behaviors),
or
alcohol/substance
abuse; and patients living in a nursing home, hospice,
or
respite
care.
Patients
who
had
a
refill
for
angiotensin-receptor
blocker
(ARB)
medication in
2010 were also excluded (to avoid a potential inclu-
sion bias with patients who could have potentially
switched to an ARB due to ACE inhibitor intolerance).
Follow-up was through December 31, 2013, and was
truncated at the following: 1) disenrollment from the
“health care benefits plan” (equivalent to lost to
follow-up); 2) death; or 3) end of the follow-up period.
INDEPENDENT VARIABLES. We used clinical judg-
ment to identify the initial set of candidate variables.

 Independent
variables
that
met
the
p
<
0.05
threshold of significance used for adjustment in the
study were as follows: sociodemographic character-
istics; pharmacy copayment and medication use; and
comorbidities and comorbidity scores. The use of
preventive services is reportedly associated with
increased medication adherence and has been intro-
duced in different studies as a proxy for the “healthy
adherer”
effect.
As
an
example,
a
primary
care
physician visit was used for an influenza vaccination
as a healthy adherer proxy variable. The specific
variables related to each category are shown in Online
Table 1 (6).
ADHERENCE
ASSESSMENT. In
the present
study,
medication adherence was estimated by calculating
the proportion of days covered (PDC) for both statins
and ACE inhibitors (class of drugs) after the index
date. The PDC calculation is made on the basis of the
fill dates and days supplied for each fill of a pre-
scription and have been extensively validated as a
measure of medication adherence in CV medicine.
The denominator refers to the number of days be-
tween the first fill and the end of the follow-up period
being measured; the numerator is the number of days
covered by the prescription fills during the denomi-
nator period. For refills identified near the end of the
observation period, only the days supplied between
that refill date and the end of the follow-up period
were counted. On the basis of previous evidence
regarding
standardized
methods
for
measuring
adherence to multiple medications, patients were
considered to be adherent if they were refilling both
ACE inhibitor and statin prescriptions concurrently
(7). The medication adherence assessment period was
6 months for the post-MI cohort and 12 months for the
atherosclerosis cohort. Patients were categorized into
1 of 3 groups on the basis of their PDCs by using
standard thresholds: $80% (fully adherent); 40% to
79% (partially adherent); and <40% (nonadherent)
(8,9).
OUTCOMES. Primary
outcome. The
primary
outcome
measure was defined as MACE, which included all-
cause mortality or hospitalization for nonfatal MI;
stroke; or coronary revascularization.
Secondary
outcomes. Secondary
outcomes
included
hospitalizations for other CV atherosclerosis-related
or angina diagnoses; emergency department (ED)
visits; ED visits for cardiac atherosclerosis-related
causes; the total number of outpatient visits to a
cardiologist and those with CV testing, such as stress
tests, echocardiograms, and diagnostic coronary an-
giograms; and cost differences between adherence
groups for each outcome.
All
outcomes
were
assessed
by
using
ICD
or
Current
Procedural
Terminology,
Fourth
Edition,
codes. Details regarding codes used are shown in
Online Appendix.
Analyses. Descriptive analyses were conducted to
compare sociodemographic characteristics, comor-
bidities, concomitant medication use, and copay-
ments between adherence exposure groups. Analysis
of variance was used to identify statistically significant
differences in continuous variables, and Pearson’s
chi-square test was used for categorical variables.
Cumulative MACE incidence functions for the 3
PDC categories were compared by using Cox propor-
tional hazards regression. Incidence function was
censored if the subject’s benefit eligibility terminated
or if he or she reached the end of the study period. A
set of independent variables, including demographic
characteristics,
comorbid
conditions,
concomitant
medication use and copayment, and preventive ser-
vice use, were assessed in the model and were
included when they remained significant at a 0.05
significance level. To test the robustness of the find-
ings,
a
sensitivity
analysis
was
also
performed
excluding hospitalizations for MACE that occurred
during
the
adherence
assessment
period
in
the
atherosclerosis cohort. The Akaike information crite-
rion was used to assess the model fit. Hazard ratios
(HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) are reported.
The number of total hospitalizations for MACE,
MIs, strokes, hospitalizations for other CV athero-
sclerosis or angina diagnoses, coronary revasculari-
zation procedures, all-cause ED visits, cardiac ED
visits, outpatient visits to a cardiologist, and those
with CV testing were compared by using negative
binomial regression and logistic regression models.
These analyses were similarly adjusted as mentioned
previously. An offset variable indicating each sub-
ject’s time in the study was included to normalize for
varying eligibility time frames. Pearson chi-square
statistics and the Akaike information criterion were
used to assess the goodness of fit of the models. Event
rates per 100 person-years, adjusted ratios, and 95%
CIs are reported.
For the cost data, a third-party payer economic
perspective was adopted. The cost estimates, on the
basis of 2012 data, were converted to 2015 U.S. dollars
on the basis of the Consumer Price Index for hospital
inpatient
services.
Per-person
cost
differences
between adherence groups for each outcome were
estimated by multiplying each outcome event rate by
each unit cost–weighted average or simple average
for ED visits and outpatient visits. Distribution of
medical claims codes from the Aetna Commercial and
Medicare Advantage population databases provided

 information to weight unit costs from national data-
bases. Weighted unit costs for these categories were
derived
considering
the
different
distribution
of
diagnostic
and
procedure
codes
in
each
cohort,
thereby
culminating
in
different
costs
for
the
same outcome. The Healthcare Cost and Utilization
Project provided information on costs of inpatient
services (stroke, MI, CV atherosclerosis, or angina)
and
procedure
codes
(inpatient
revascularization
procedures). The Medicare Outpatient Prospective
Payment System database provided 2015 outpatient
services geometric mean costs according to Current
Procedural
Terminology,
Fourth
Edition,
codes
(outpatient
revascularization
procedures
and
CV
tests). Costs for outpatient and inpatient physician
services were estimated on the basis of the Medicare
Physician Fee Schedule.
Statistical analyses were performed by using SAS
version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina).
The Sterling Institutional Review Board (registration
number IRB00001790) approved this study.
RESULTS
After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria,
4,015 patients from the post-MI cohort (Figure 1A) and
12,976
patients
from
the
atherosclerosis
cohort
(Figure 1B) were eligible for analyses.
In the post-MI cohort, 1,031 (26%) patients were
classified as nonadherent, 1,263 (31%) as partially
adherent, and 1,721 (43%) as fully adherent. For the
atherosclerosis
cohort, 3,571 (28%)
patients
were
classified as nonadherent, 4,941 (38%) as partially
adherent, and 4,464 (34%) as fully adherent.
The baseline characteristics of both study cohorts
are shown in Table 1. Interestingly, the partially
adherent post-MI cohort had the highest rates of
diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, peripheral
disease, and chronic renal failure among the 3 groups,
translating into a higher Charlson comorbidity score.
The average PDC for both medications together ac-
cording to adherence group was approximately 93%,
62%, and 21%, respectively, in the post-MI cohort.

 In the atherosclerosis cohort, there was an increase
in the prevalence of depression, diabetes, chronic
renal failure, and Charlson comorbidity score with
decreasing levels of adherence. In the atherosclerosis
cohort, average PDC according to adherence group
was 90%, 62%, and 19%, respectively, for both classes
of drugs.
MAJOR CLINICAL OUTCOMES. Primary outcome. In
the
post-MI
cohort,
the
fully
adherent
group
had a significantly lower risk of experiencing MACE
than the nonadherent group (18.9% vs. 26.3%; HR,
0.73; 95% CI: 0.61 to 0.87; p ¼ 0.0004) and the
partially adherent group (18.9% vs. 24.7%; HR: 0.81;
95% CI: 0.69 to 0.96; p ¼ 0.02). No statistical
difference was observed between the nonadherent
and partially adherent groups (p ¼ 0.22) (Figure 2,
Table 2).
In the atherosclerosis cohort, the fully adherent
group had a significantly lower rate of MACE than the
nonadherent (8.42% vs. 17.17%; HR: 0.56; p < 0.0001)
and
the
partially
adherent
(8.42%
vs.
12.18%;
HR: 0.76; p < 0.0001) groups at 2 years, and the
partially adherent group also had a significantly lower
risk than the nonadherent group (HR: 0.73; 95% CI:
0.67 to 0.80; p < 0.0001). The sensitivity analysis of
the atherosclerosis cohort showed that the difference
between the fully adherent (HR: 0.73; 95% CI: 0.63 to
0.84; p < 0.0001) and partially adherent (HR: 0.80;
95% CI: 0.70 to 0.92; p ¼ 0.0021) groups compared
with the nonadherent group persisted; however, the
difference between the fully adherent and partially
adherent cohorts was attenuated to a statistically
insignificant level (HR: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.79 to 1.04;
p ¼ 0.18) (Figure 3, Table 2).

ratio: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.62 to 0.85; p ¼ 0.0001) and the
partially adherent group (adjusted ratio: 0.81; 95% CI:
0.69 to 0.94; p ¼ 0.007). Although the partially
adherent group reported a reduction in hospitaliza-
tions compared with the nonadherent group, this
finding was not statistically
significant (adjusted
ratio: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.76 to 1.05; p ¼ 0.18).
In the atherosclerosis cohort, the rate of hospital-
izations for this outcome exhibited a different pattern
compared with the post-MI cohort in terms of signif-
icantly fewer hospitalizations in the fully adherent
group compared with the nonadherent group, and in
the
partially
adherent group compared with the
nonadherent group. Table 3 provides further details
regarding
the
impact
of
levels
of
adherence
on
various combinations of the primary outcome mea-
sure in both cohorts.
SECONDARY
OUTCOMES. Clinical. No
significant
differences were found in the rate of hospitalizations
due to CV atherosclerosis or angina in the post-MI
cohort
(Table
4).
In
the
atherosclerosis
cohort,
the fully adherent cohort exhibited a significant
reduction
in
the
rate
of
hospitalizations
of
the
composite outcome compared with the nonadherent
group (adjusted ratio: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.46 to 0.58;
p
<
0.0001)
and
the
partially
adherent
group
(adjusted
ratio:
0.71;
95%
CI:
0.63
to
0.79;
p < 0.0001). In addition, the partially adherent
group had a significantly lower reduction than the
nonadherent group (adjusted ratio: 0.73; 95% CI:
0.66 to 0.81; p < 0.0001).

 Cost results. In the post-MI cohort, full adherence
to statins and ACE inhibitors was associated with
reduced
per-patient
annual
direct
medical
costs
associated with hospitalizations for MI of $369 and
$440 and for revascularization procedures of $539
and $844 compared with partial and nonadherence,
respectively.
The
sensitivity
analysis
found
per-
patient annual direct medical cost differences of
$465 and $553 for MI, and $562 and $880 for revas-
cularization procedures, compared with partial and
nonadherence.
In the atherosclerosis cohort, full adherence was
related to a reduced per-patient annual direct medical
cost associated with hospitalization for MI of $116 and
$215 and for revascularizations of $288 and $799
compared with partial and nonadherence, respec-
tively. The reduction in hospitalizations due to CV
atherosclerosis or angina in this cohort was estimated
at $371 and $907 compared with partial and non-
adherence. The sensitivity analysis found per-patient
annual direct medical cost differences of $149 and
$276 for MI, $325 and $900 for revascularization
procedures, and $333 and $813 for angina or athero-
sclerosis compared with partial and nonadherence.
Table 5 provides further details regarding the cost
outcomes.
DISCUSSION
We evaluated the impact of adherence levels in post-
MI and atherosclerosis patients enrolled in a large
U.S. insurer plan who had continuous health insur-
ance, including prescription drug coverage. Four
major conclusions were made from these results.

 First,
only
43%
of
patients
post-MI
were
fully
adherent
to
guideline-indicated
therapy
(Central
Illustration). In the longer term, only 34% were fully
adherent. Second, being fully adherent reduced the
risk of MACE by >25% compared with nonadherence
and by at least 20% compared with partial adherence.
Third, to accrue benefit required a very high level of
adherence (>80%) in the acute phase in post-MI pa-
tients and $40% long-term adherence in the more
chronic atherosclerosis model. Fourth, better medi-
cation adherence led to important cost savings.
Previous
evidence
has
shown
that
guideline-
indicated secondary preventive medication can miti-
gate risk for future events by >50% (3). In the real
world,
widespread
use
of
these
medications
in
patients after MI has contributed substantially to
reductions in CV mortality. However, the benefits of
these therapies are limited by patient adherence to
treatment. Multiple large surveys (10), prospective
registries (5), retrospective observational studies (11),
meta-analyses, and data from randomized trials (12)
have conclusively established that at least 50% of
patients are not adequately adherent to their pre-
scribed medications within the first 1 to 2 years after
their
index
event.
Few
previous
studies
have
analyzed medication adherence in a secondary pre-
vention population, specifically including patients
with cerebrovascular disease and peripheral artery
disease.
The
international
REACH
(Reduction
of
Atherothrombosis for Continued Health) registry in
secondary prevention patients showed that adher-
ence to medication at both baseline and 1 year was
significantly associated with the lowest incidence of
adverse outcomes (p < 0.01) (5,13). Newby et al. (14)
analyzed the use of evidence-based therapies during
the period from 1995 to 2002 for patients with docu-
mented coronary artery disease in the Duke Databank
for
Cardiovascular
Disease.
They
showed
that
consistent use of CV medication in patients with
coronary artery disease was associated with statisti-
cally significant lower adjusted mortality. Our results
confirm that increasing adherence to CV medications
is associated with a significantly decreased risk of
MACE hospitalizations in a secondary prevention
cohort.
ADHERENCE PATTERNS. The post-MI cohort showed
that compared with patients who were nonadherent,
those who were fully adherent to their prescribed
secondary prevention medications had significantly
better event-free survival, with a 27% risk reduction
of
MACE.
However,
patients
who
were
partially
adherent did not enjoy the same protective benefit
compared with nonadherent subjects, highlighting
the need for very high levels of adherence (>80%) in
the acute phase.
The atherosclerosis cohort displayed a different
pattern, with fully adherent patients exhibiting a 44%
and 24% risk reduction of MACE compared with
nonadherent
and
partially
adherent
patients,
respectively. In addition, the partially adherent group
presented a 27% risk reduction over nonadherent
patients. The sensitivity analysis added to the val-
idity of the study and confirmed the pattern between
the fully adherent and partially adherent groups
compared with the nonadherent group. The differ-
ence
between
the
fully
adherent
and
partially
adherent groups in the atherosclerosis cohort was
attenuated,
not
reaching
statistical
significance
because the rate of hospitalizations decreased in the
second year in all groups and became too low to
detect statistical significance. It seems, therefore,
that one needs to maintain at least $40% adherence
in the long term to continue to accrue benefit. It re-
mains true that there is a linear relationship between
higher adherence (>80%) levels and risk reduction for
MACE. These findings have profound and lasting

 policy implications for accountable care organizations
and quality measure targets.
COST. The total costs of CV disease in 2010 were
estimated to be $444 billion, representing approxi-
mately 17% of overall national health expenditures,
with direct health care costs comprising about 61% in
the United States (15). In addition, nearly one-third of
all health care is attributed to inpatient hospital ser-
vices (16). In the present study, we estimated per-
person
cost
differences
between
the
adherence
groups in both cohorts. Full adherence to statins and
ACE inhibitors was associated with reduced per-
patient annual direct medical costs. This difference
was mainly driven by a lower rate of CV events and
revascularization procedures with higher adherence.
Drivers and directionality of the impact of use and
cost of health services were similar to results reported
in previous research by Roebuck et al. (17) and Jha
et al. (18).
The World Health Organization found that patient-,
provider-, and system-level factors each may play a
role in suboptimal adherence (19). Most interventions
designed at improving quality of care and monitoring
patients after an MI have focused on efforts to
improve prescribing and patient knowledge at the
time of hospital discharge (20). In contrast, value-
based insurance designs that lower copayments of
highly cost-effective medications or provide disease
management programs aim to increase long-term
medication use. However, data are lacking from ran-
domized controlled studies evaluating the effective-
ness of these combined strategies (21). In addition,
many of the post-MI interventions with the most
successful adherence are extremely labor-intensive,
involving strategies such as individual counseling,
medication education, pharmacy post-discharge pro-
grams, or visiting nurse or nurse practitioner–based
services. In the era of dramatic changes to the health
care economic landscape in the United States, such as
the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and, more recently,
the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of
2010, efforts to improve health care quality must
be coupled with efforts to contain costs. Ito et al.
(22) evaluated the efficiency of various interventions
(e.g.,
mailed
education,
disease
management,
a
polypill) and combinations of these interventions.
Results showed that a polypill combined with mailed
education could be cost-effective and potentially
cost-saving. Other modeling exercises have repli-
cated this potential cost-saving with the use of a
polypill (23).
STUDY
LIMITATIONS. Our study should be inter-
preted in the context in which it was performed.
It was conducted by using a large, geographically
diverse sample of patients with health care benefits
from a U.S. national health insurer, including Medi-
care Advantage and commercial insurance, spanning
varied employer-sponsored benefit plans. Our find-
ings were attained on the basis of insurance and
pharmacy claims data, and they benefit from the
strengths of such systematic data collection regarding
medications, procedures, and hospitalizations but
also suffer from the limitations inherent in the use of
insurance claims data. In fact, possession of a current
filled prescription is a necessary, although not always
sufficient, condition for therapy adherence. Under-
estimation may be related to patients paying out-of-
pocket,
and
overestimation
may
occur
because
claims data do not actually confirm if the patient is
taking the medication as prescribed. However, the
requirement that patients filled at least 1 prescription
after hospital discharge and the extended follow-up
through 2 years help to mitigate these concerns.
Grymonpre et al. (24) studied the validity of a similar
measure for ACE inhibitor use among elderly patients
and reported 95% concordance with pill counts. High
correlation between claims-based measures and pill
counts suggests that the rate of medications refill is
usually consistent with the rate at which patients
consume them.
Furthermore, although aspirin was of particular
interest in the context of studying the impact of
multiple medications in patients at CV risk, it is pri-
marily obtained over-the-counter and thus not reli-
ably
measured
in
an
insurance
claims
dataset.
Medical claims data also lack the richness of clinical
data in measuring clinical outcomes, including cause
of
death.
The
lack
of
benefit
for
many
of
the
secondary outcomes is likely related to inadequate
power and reduced specificity regarding these events
through claims-based data. Furthermore, our study’s
primary
outcome
was
measured
from
the
time
immediately after the refill or post-discharge, thus
leading
to
some
overlap
within
the
adherence
assessment period. However, as previously noted, we
performed a sensitivity analysis excluding hospitali-
zations that occurred during the adherence assess-
ment period in the atherosclerosis population; this
approach helped to mitigate concerns of overlapping
adherence and event evaluation periods in the largest
cohort. It could also be argued that the fully adherent
cohort seemed to have a lower risk profile at baseline,
and the partially adherent cohort seemed to have a
higher risk profile, which may have contributed to our
findings; but, as previously stated, our outcomes
were adjusted for multiple factors, including health-
seeking behaviors, in an attempt to overcome the

 issues of confounding inherent in an observational
cohort study. This set of variables was individually
assessed in the model, and included if and when they
reached statistical significance.
Thus, associations in both studies between medi-
cation nonadherence and adverse hospitalizations
were independent of important potential confound-
ing variables, such as age, pharmacy copayment,
and CV risk factors. In addition, the consistent asso-
ciation between nonadherence and MACE hospitali-
zations may be the result of a healthy adherer effect,
whereby adherent patients are probably less likely to
engage in risky behaviors and more likely to follow
medical recommendations. We specifically included
variables related to health-seeking behaviors, such as
flu vaccination in the adherence period data, to
adjust for this confounder. We believe that these
approaches added to the richness and validity of our
findings. Although both medications are guideline-
recommended, the requirement of both a statin and
an ACE inhibitor refill limits practical generalizability
to some extent.
CONCLUSIONS
Being
fully
adherent
to
guideline-recommended
therapies was associated with a lower rate of MACE
compared with partial or nonadherence; it was also
associated with lower costs. There seemed to be a
threshold effect for this benefit at >80% adherence in
the post-MI population; $40% levels of adherence
need to be maintained in the long term to continue to
accrue benefit. Novel approaches to improve adher-
ence may significantly reduce CV events post-MI.

PERSPECTIVES
COMPETENCY IN SYSTEMS-BASED PRACTICE:
Better medication adherence may be associated with a
reduction in major CV events and cost savings.
TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Strategies that
improve medication adherence should be evaluated in
randomized trials to assess their true impact on CV
outcomes.
