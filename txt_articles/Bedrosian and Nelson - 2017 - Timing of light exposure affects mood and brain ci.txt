Timing of light exposure affects mood and brain circuits
TA Bedrosian1 and RJ Nelson2
Temporal organization of physiology is critical for human health. In the past, humans experienced predictable periods of daily light
and dark driven by the solar day, which allowed for entrainment of intrinsic circadian rhythms to the environmental light–dark
cycles. Since the adoption of electric light, however, pervasive exposure to nighttime lighting has blurred the boundaries of day and
night, making it more difficult to synchronize biological processes. Many systems are under circadian control, including sleep–wake
behavior, hormone secretion, cellular function and gene expression. Circadian disruption by nighttime light perturbs those
processes and is associated with increasing incidence of certain cancers, metabolic dysfunction and mood disorders. This review
focuses on the role of artificial light at night in mood regulation, including mechanisms through which aberrant light exposure
affects the brain. Converging evidence suggests that circadian disruption alters the function of brain regions involved in emotion
and mood regulation. This occurs through direct neural input from the clock or indirect effects, including altered neuroplasticity,
neurotransmission and clock gene expression. Recently, the aberrant light exposure has been recognized for its health effects. This
review summarizes the evidence linking aberrant light exposure to mood.

INTRODUCTION
Organisms on Earth are adapted to the 24-h solar day. Predictable
daily cycles of light and dark allow for the synchronization of
behavioral and biological processes to the external environment.
For nonhuman animals, restricting activities to the appropriate
temporal niche is crucial to fitness and survival. For humans,
temporal organization of physiology is equally important for
health and wellness. Over the past century, the boundaries of day
and night have been obscured by the widespread adoption of
electric light at night. Circadian disruption has become prevalent
among wildlife and humans. A growing body of ecological
research points to nighttime lighting near urban areas as a major
disruption to wildlife migration, foraging activities, reproduction
and immune function.1 For humans, health consequences of
circadian disruption by light at night are becoming increasingly
apparent.2 Exposure to artificial light at night is linked to risk of
breast cancer, metabolic disorders and psychiatric and behavioral
disorders3–7 (Figure 1). We focus below on human exposure to
light at night and its consequences for circadian rhythms
and mood.
Before the advent of electric lights about a century ago, humans
were exposed to minimal light at night. A full moon on a clear
night illuminated the environment 0.1–0.3 lux,8 or up to 1.0 lux in
the tropics.9 A candle placed a meter away casted only 1.0 lux of
light. At the end of the Nineteenth century, with the invention of
the electric light bulb, exposure to artificial light at night grew
rapidly. For the first time, humans could effectively artificially
extend the day. Night shift work was introduced soon after. As
technology boomed, humans encountered even more sources of
light
at
night,
including
television
and
computer
screens,
smartphones and tablet computers (Table 1). Today over 80% of
the human population and 99% of those living in the United
States or Europe experience light pollution.10 Two-thirds of
Europeans and nearly 80% of North Americans cannot see the
Milky Way due to artificial night sky glow.10 Approximately 15–
20% of the population is engaged in shift work and countless
individuals are exposed to nightly light pollution from other
sources.11 The light intensity on an average urban street is
estimated at 5–15 lux and a typical living room at 100–300 lux.8
Electronic tablet computers emit ~ 40 lux, depending on the size
of the screen.12 According to the National Sleep Foundation, 36%
of parents and 34% of children leave an electronic device such as
a television or computer on in their room while sleeping.13 In
addition, 87% of women watch television in the hour before
bedtime.14 This amount of nighttime light exposure is unprece-
dented in human history (Figure 2).
Exposure to light at night perturbs the circadian system
because light is the major entraining cue used by the body to
discriminate day and night. When exposure to light is mistimed or
nearly constant, biological and behavioral rhythms can become
desynchronized, leading to negative consequences for health.
Mood disorders have long been associated with light and
circadian rhythms. One example is seasonal affective disorder in
which mood oscillates between dysthymia during the short day
lengths of winter and euthymia during the long summer days. In
fact, a striking number of mood disorders are either characterized
by sleep and circadian rhythm disruption or precipitated by an
irregular light cycle. Sleep disruption is a diagnostic criterion for
major depression, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder,
generalized
anxiety
and
other
mood
disorders.18
Circadian
regulation permeates most systems believed to control mood,
including limbic brain regions, monoamine neurotransmitters and
the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis. Thus, it is reasonable that
widespread exposure to light at night that disrupts circadian

 function may contribute to the prevalence of mood disorders.19
Major depression in particular represents a serious public health
concern, as the incidence is increasing in modern societies.20–22
We will review the evidence to date supporting the hypothesis
that nighttime light affects mood. To do so, we will begin with a
brief overview of normal circadian function, followed by a
discussion of mechanisms through which light may affect mood,
and finally, present examples from human and rodent studies,
directly demonstrating consequences of chronic nighttime light
exposure on mood.
LIGHT DETECTION AND CIRCADIAN FUNCTION
In mammals, the retina detects light using specialized photo-
receptor cells. The classical photoreceptors, rods and cones are
primarily responsible for image-forming vision. The third class of
photoreceptors, called intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion
cells (ipRGCs), perform non-image-forming functions, including
circadian phototransduction. ipRGCs represent a small fraction of
the larger class of retinal ganglion cells, but their expression
of
the
photopigment
melanopsin
makes
them
uniquely
photosensitive.23 In the absence of rods and cones, ipRGCs are
sufficient to entrain circadian responses to light24 and maintain
normal photic melatonin suppression.25 On the other hand, mice
lacking the melanopsin gene still entrain to light cycles, but only
to a lesser degree.26 They also exhibit defects in phase-resetting in
response to light pulses, highlighting the importance of mela-
nopsin to circadian photoentrainment.27
The spectral characteristics of melanopsin responses are such
that blue light (~480 nm) most strongly stimulates ipRGCs,
whereas red light (4600 nm) has minimal effect.28 Interestingly,
daytime sunlight contains more blue wavelengths than sunset. As
the sun gets closer to the horizon, short wavelengths are scattered
in the atmosphere and longer, redder wavelengths more easily
reach the surface of the Earth. The sensitivity spectrum of
melanopsin may be an adaptation to the natural solar cycle, so
that ipRGCs are tuned to discriminate daylight from evening,
better entraining the circadian rhythm. Recently, some countries
have mandated a switch from incandescent bulbs to compact
fluorescent bulbs or light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to save energy
(Figure 3). Depending on the color temperature, some compact
fluorescents and LEDs produce a blue-shifted spectrum relative to
incandescent bulbs, to which the human circadian system is most
sensitive.29 It will be important to consider the biological effects of
lighting spectrums in home and workplace design. When exposed
to light in the activating spectrum, ipRGCs directly project to the
body’s circadian master clock, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN)
of the hypothalamus. In addition, they have other direct and
indirect targets throughout the brain, including mood-related
structures.30 As a primary function, light detected by ipRGCs sets
the molecular clock in the SCN.
The molecular clock in the SCN is composed of a set of
transcriptional–translational feedback loops that drive rhythmic
24-h expression of the core clock components.31 In the primary
feedback loop, CLOCK and BMAL1 proteins form heterodimers
that activate gene expression of Period (Per) and Cryptochrome
(Cry). PER and CRY proteins then heterodimerize and translocate
into the nucleus, where they repress their own transcription by
acting on the CLOCK/BMAL1 complexes. In an interacting feed-
back loop, CLOCK/BMAL1 complexes activate expression of
retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors, Rev-erbα and
RORα. Their protein products feedback to regulate Bmal1 by
competitively
binding
retinoic
acid-related
orphan
receptor
response elements in the Bmal1 promoter. Reverse viral erythro-
blastosis oncogene products repress the transcription of Bmal1,
whereas RORs activate it. These two loops form the basis of the
molecular clock, but a complex network of interacting genes and
post-translational modifications ensure that the process takes
~ 24 h to complete.32 Again, this transcriptional–translational
feedback loop is the basis of the intrinsic daily circadian rhythm.
In the absence of any environmental signals, the molecular
clock will continue to produce ~ 24-h rhythms. Ex vivo cultures of
SCN neurons continue to express near 24-h rhythms for weeks
after being removed from the body.33 Humans living in caves
without any light or temperature cues will maintain circadian
sleep–wake and body temperature rhythms, although they begin
to free-run on a cycle slightly longer than 24 h.34 Therefore, light
serves as the major entraining cue to maintain perfect synchrony
with the environment. Light detected at night phase shifts the
cycle by rapidly inducing expression of Per1 or Per2, depending on
whether the light occurs in early or late night.35–37 Phase shifting
can be useful for adapting to changing seasonal day lengths or a
new time zone, but it can be detrimental when unwarranted. For
example, using electronics at night can unintentionally phase shift
the circadian rhythm, leaving it decoupled from the natural
environmental light–dark cycle.38
The SCN functions as the central circadian pacemaker, although
the intracellular clock mechanism is expressed in other brain
regions and in peripheral tissues. Clocks throughout the body
remain synchronized with one another by responding to signals
from the SCN, either through direct neural inputs or indirect cues
such as hormonal, behavioral and physiological rhythms. For
example, rhythms in feeding and body temperature can help
synchronize peripheral oscillators.39,40 Aberrant light exposure
that disrupts these rhythms may drive downstream dysregulation
of circadian rhythms in peripheral systems. Of note, time of day
information reaching the pineal gland via the SCN potently
regulates secretion of the hormone melatonin. Melatonin is a
small indoleamine that is produced and secreted in a 24-h rhythm
that peaks at night. Circulating melatonin aids in entrainment of
clocks located in peripheral organs through a number of
interactions with the molecular clock mechanism, including
phase-resetting clock genes.41 Exposure to light at night, even
at very low intensities, strongly inhibits melatonin secretion, which
may disrupt overall synchrony of the central and peripheral
clocks.42 In addition, the circadian system regulates glucocorticoid
secretion from the adrenal glands such that concentrations tend
to peak in the morning just before awakening and decrease
throughout the day.43 Glucocorticoids are important in stress
responses through their role in the hypothalamic–pituitary–
adrenal axis, where they are involved in a negative feedback

 loop to maintain homeostatic concentrations of stress hormones.
Glucocorticoid dysregulation has been associated with a number
of mood disorders; in particular, hypercortisolemia is detected in a
subset of major depression patients.44 Light directly affects
secretion of glucocorticoids in humans, suggesting mistimed light
exposure interacts with the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis
and stress responsivity.45
ABERRANT LIGHT EXPOSURE AND THE BRAIN
Much of the evidence for effects of aberrant light exposure on the
brain has arisen from studying model organisms, including
rodents. Many rodent species are nocturnal, unlike humans,
meaning that exposure to light at night occurs during their active
and awake phase. Indeed some effects of nighttime light are likely
attributed to sleep disruption in humans, but studies using
nocturnal species show that it is not the only cause. Studies in
diurnal Nile grass rats have attempted to overcome this difference.
Another important difference between humans and rodents is the
production of pineal melatonin. Although both nocturnal and
diurnal species produce melatonin during the dark phase, certain
inbred laboratory strains of mice have no detectable pineal
melatonin rhythm at all. Studies performed using C57bl/6 mice
(no detectable pineal melatonin) versus Siberian hamsters (robust
pineal melatonin rhythm) have reported similar effects of light at
night on affective responses. This demonstrates that melatonin
suppression by nighttime light is not the only mechanism, but still
may be an important contributor in humans and a potential point
of intervention.
Accumulating evidence demonstrates both direct and indirect
connections between artificial light at night and mood regulation.
For one, aberrant light exposure can directly affect mood through
ipRGC projections to brain regions involved in emotionality.46,47
Mice exposed to an alternating cycle of 3.5 h light and 3.5 h dark
(termed T7), which does not significantly affect cycling clock gene
expression or sleep, developed behavioral symptoms reminiscent
of depression.47 Mice lacking the melanopsin gene were protected
against such depressive responses, suggesting the behavioral
changes occurred because ipRGCs project either directly or via the
SCN to brain regions involved in mood.30 In addition, there are
several indirect pathways affected by light at night that may
contribute to mood disturbances (Figure 4). A host of behavioral
and brain changes have been implicated in mood disorders,
including disruption of sleep, brain plasticity, neurotransmission,
hormone secretion and gene expression. All of these processes are
to some extent under circadian control and thus vulnerable to
disruption by environmental perturbations of daily rhythms. This
section discusses some of many possible mechanisms for the
behavioral and emotional effects of artificial nighttime lighting.
Sleep
Sleep disturbance is an important factor contributing to the onset
and maintenance of mood disorders.48 One of the most obvious
potential effects of nighttime lighting is sleep disruption. During
dark nights, melatonin concentrations rise to promote sleep onset
and regulate circadian sleep phase.49–51 Exposure to light at night
strongly suppresses melatonin, which interferes with sleep timing
Figure 4.
Mechanisms of depressed mood caused by exposure to light at night. Studies in rodent models have revealed several putative
mechanisms through which exposure to artificial light at night disrupts mood. Nighttime light can indirectly affect mood by disrupting sleep,
hormone secretion, neuroplasticity, neurotransmission or gene expression. In parallel, nighttime light can directly affect mood through aberrant
signals transmitted from ipRGCs in the retina to brain regions involved in emotional regulation. In the panel, green brain regions represent primary

 and sleep quality. Individuals who used an eReader (30–50 lux)
during the 4 h before bedtime experienced increased latency to
fall asleep and decreased morning alertness. The symptoms
coincided with a significant suppression of melatonin.38 Similarly,
individuals who slept with a night light of ~ 40 lux had shallower
sleep and increased arousals, as well as markedly decreased brain
oscillations during sleep.52 Brain oscillations during sleep have
been linked to cognition; so it is possible that even relatively low
levels of nighttime light could have detrimental effects on
cognitive function through sleep disruption.53,54 Interestingly,
indoor light pollution is not the only source of sleep disruption.
Two large epidemiological studies reported that even light
pollution outside the home was sufficient to disrupt sleep. In a
study of more than 19 000 individuals, those living in areas with
more outdoor night lighting self-reported less quality and quantity
of sleep, as well as more daytime sleepiness.55 In another cohort of
almost 9000 individuals, symptoms of insomnia and snoring were
associated with areas of high light pollution.56 Although mood
was not investigated in these studies, sleep and emotional
regulation are intimately linked; sleep disruption is one potential
mechanism through which light at night is implicated in
depressed mood.57 However, sleep is likely only one of several
contributors
because
nocturnal
mice
develop
depressive
responses after exposure to light at night without experiencing
any sleep disruption.58,59 The data seem consistent with light at
night deranging circadian clocks, sleep being one of the 'hands' of
the endogenous biological clocks.
Rhythmic expression of clock genes
Clock gene disruption is another core contributor to the effects of
light at night. Exposure to light at night alters expression of clock
genes and interacts with existing circadian gene variants that may
predispose to mood disorders. Mice and hamsters exposed to dim
light at night consistently show blunted amplitude of clock gene
expression in the brain.60–62 Circadian genes appear to have
critical roles in mood regulation, as mutations in a number of
them have been linked to various behavioral impairments related
to mood. For example, mice with a mutation of the Clock gene
display a behavioral profile similar to mania in humans, including
hyperactivity, reduced sleep and increased reward sensitivity.63
Genome-wide association studies identified polymorphisms in
circadian genes that associated with psychiatric diseases,64–66
suggesting that abnormalities in clock gene function may be a
cause rather than an effect of mood disorder pathology.
Jet lag
Phase shifts induced by jet lag represent a relevant model of
desynchrony between intrinsic biological rhythms and external
environmental rhythms. Typically, jet lag is associated with rapid
phase shifting and light exposure out of phase with the biological
rhythm.
Vasopressin
signaling
in
the
SCN
resists
external
perturbation and maintains a steady intrinsic rhythm, making it
somewhat difficult to adjust to a new time zone. Mice lacking
vasopressin receptors V1a and V1b more easily phase shift their
rhythms to re-entrain to a new light cycle, showing improved
ability to cope with artificial jet lag.67 Experimental models of
chronic jet lag have revealed profound effects on brain function
and behavior. Hamsters subjected to 6-h phase advances every
3 days for 25 days developed learning and memory deficits that
coincided with reduced hippocampal cell proliferation and
neurogenesis.68 Phase advances induce a larger decrease in
neurogenesis compared with phase delays, in agreement with the
observation that phase advances are more disruptive to mouse
clock gene expression than phase delays.69 In humans, flight
attendants working transmeridian flights with short recovery time
between shifts developed temporal lobe atrophy (~3% decrease
in volume on average) and cognitive deficits (~10% decrease in
reaction time and correct response rate to a visual spatial task).70
Similarly, patients admitted for psychiatric emergencies who
recently traveled across time zones were more likely to display
symptoms of depression or mania compared with non-travelers.71
These findings implicate structural changes in the brain as one
downstream effect of circadian rhythm disruption.
Seasonal changes in day length
Seasonal changes in day length are known to alter mood. At
temperate latitudes, nearly 10% of the population experiences
winter depression characteristic of seasonal affective disorder.72
Symptoms remit when day lengths become longer during the
summer months. The symptoms of seasonal affective disorder are
thought to relate to a phase shift in the pineal melatonin rhythm
caused by lower levels of daylight. Bright light therapy in the
morning suppresses melatonin secretion and re-entrains the
rhythm, improving symptoms in some patients.73 At very high
latitudes, individuals experience nearly constant daylight during
certain times of the year. In some parts of Finland north of the
Arctic Circle, the sun does not set for 60 days during the summer.
At least one group has reported violent suicides increase
dramatically during these periods.74,75 These observations indicate
that appropriately timed light exposure is important for circadian
function and mood. Either a lack or an excess of light can have
significant effects on health and mood.
Neuroplasticity
Impaired neuroplasticity is a feature of major depression, such that
patients display reduced hippocampal volume,76–78 lower levels of
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)79 and deficits in func-
tional plasticity.80 Changes in adult neurogenesis or neuronal
morphology have been observed in several animal models of
depression.81 Circadian disruption is thought to induce structural
changes
in
the
brain,
which
could
affect
the
functional
connectivity of regions involved in mood regulation. Specifically,
rodent studies have consistently found a relationship between the
lighting
environment
and
the
rate
of
adult
hippocampal
neurogenesis. Adult mice housed in continuous light had reduced
hippocampal neurogenesis and impairments in learning and
memory in a water maze task.82 As mentioned above, hamsters
subjected to chronic phase shifts, a paradigm mimicking jet lag in
humans,
displayed
similar
reductions
in
neurogenesis
and
learning and memory ability.68 Structural and functional complex-
ity of neurons is similarly affected. Mice subjected to circadian
disruption through a 20-h light/dark cycle exhibited a loss of
dendritic length and complexity in neurons of the prelimbic
prefrontal cortex, associated with anxiety and learning deficits.83
Rats housed in constant light had impaired performance in the
Morris water maze and impaired ability to form long-term
depression.84 These effects are consistent in both nocturnal and
diurnal animals. In Nile grass rats, a diurnal model, dim light at
night provoked similar depressive behaviors and reduced the
length of dendrites on hippocampal CA1 and dentate gyrus
granule neurons.85 Harnessing our knowledge of the spectral
sensitivity of ipRGCs could reduce the effects of artificial light at
night. Housing hamsters in dim light at night caused depressive
responses and reduced the density of dendritic spines on
hippocampal CA1 neurons in a wavelength-dependent manner,
such that red light had a minimal effect compared with white or
blue light.86,87
Neurotransmission
Monoamine (that is, serotonin (5-HT), dopamine (DA), norepi-
nephrine) transmission is thought to be impaired in depressive
disorders and it is the primary target of most current antidepres-
sant medications. Several of these neurotransmitters and their
Timing of light exposure and brain circuits

 receptors display circadian rhythms in concentration, release and
expression.88–92 Monoamine oxidase A (Maoa) transcription is
regulated by clock components such that a mutation in Per2
reduces MAOA activity.93 These findings imply that environmental
circadian disruption that perturbs clock gene expression will also
modulate neurotransmitter systems, suggesting that impaired
neurotransmission is another potential mechanism of depressed
mood caused by nighttime lighting. Indeed, exposure to light at
night seems to alter neurotrophin and neurotransmitter systems.
Mice exposed to 4 weeks of dim light at night displayed
depressive symptoms and reduced Bdnf mRNA expression in the
hippocampus compared with mice exposed to a typical light–dark
cycle.59 Mice exposed to 4 h of light in the middle of an otherwise
dark night also reduced Bdnf mRNA expression in the hippocam-
pus and other brain regions involved in emotional regulation.94
Several neurotransmitter systems have been investigated for their
relationship to environmental light. DA, glutamate and GABA
concentrations oscillate in a circadian rhythm in the rat striatum
and nucleus accumbens; the DA rhythm is responsive to light,
whereas the others are less responsive.95 Furthermore, housing
rats under continuous lighting abolishes late afternoon declines in
DOPA within the median eminence, but melatonin injections
restore the rhythm.96 DA is just one example of the connection
between environmental lighting and neurotransmitter systems.
Indeed the effect of light can be so profound that exposure to
long versus short photoperiods causes hypothalamic interneurons
to switch between DA and somatostatin expression in the rat
brain.97 The specific regimen of light exposure seems to be
important, however, because some artificial light cycles may not
have the same effect as others. Exposure to an artificial light
cycle consisting of 6 h light and 6 h dark reduced 5-HT levels
and increased norepinephrine levels, while leaving DA levels
unchanged.98
ABERRANT LIGHT EXPOSURE AND MOOD
Given the sensitivity of the molecular clock to the timing, intensity
and spectra of illumination, artificial light at night can cause
serious circadian and physiological disruption. Exposure to light at
night is prevalent throughout life, beginning in early childhood
and extending into old age. This chronic level of nighttime light
exposure is unprecedented in human history. A growing body of
research shows that one consequence of nighttime lighting is
disrupted mood regulation and that humans are sensitive across
the lifespan.
Childhood and adolescence are periods of likely exposure to
light at night, as well as sensitive windows for brain development.
Children commonly sleep with night lights and adolescents tend
to stay up late at night using electronics. A 1999 survey found that
only 10% of young people aged 2–16 slept in complete
darkness.99 Exposure to light at night affects the circadian
phenotype of these individuals. Adolescents living in dense,
urban areas with high levels of outdoor illumination have stronger
evening-oriented chronotypes than those living in darker, rural
areas, as do adolescents with more evening use of electronic
media.100 Compounding the tendency to stay up later, young
people tend to be more sensitive to the melatonin-suppressing
effects of light at night than adults.101 Research efforts should
focus on determining the long-term effects of circadian disruption
by light at night during early life, as studies in rodents suggest
there are long-lasting consequences of exposure. Mice exposed to
dim light at night during the first 3 weeks of life had increased
anxiety as adults.102 Rats exposed to constant bright light in early
life also displayed permanent changes in emotionality, but they
were protected against developing depressive-like behaviors
when exposed to constant light again as adults.103 Considering
the widespread exposure to nighttime light in early life, these
results should be pursued with additional research.
Among the adult population of developed societies, 15–20% of
individuals are engaged in shift work that exposes them to light at
night on a chronic or rotating basis. Epidemiological studies
repeatedly link shift work to symptoms of depression. Workers
exposed to shift work are more likely to suffer depressive
episodes, with prolonged shift work of more than 20 years
resulting in increased lifetime risk of major depression.104 Even a
single night of shift work among student nurses elicited changes
in mood.105 Multiple components involved in night shift work may
affect mood, including exposure to light and sleep disruption.
These components will need to be teased out in additional
experiments, but there is evidence that appropriately timed bright
light therapy can improve mood in shift workers. Restricting light
exposure to the night and maintaining darkness during the day
allowed workers to adapt to a reversed circadian cycle, which
improved alertness and cognition.106 Unfortunately, maintaining a
reversed circadian cycle is difficult under typical circumstances, as
workers revert back to a standard cycle on weekends or off days,
which disrupts their circadian function further. Likewise, exposure
to just 30 min of bright light (43000 lux) during the work shift
improved the mood of night shift nurses,107 but this was likely a
short-term effect that would not ameliorate
symptoms of
depression resulting from long-term night shifts. Interestingly,
there are individual variations in sensitivity to light at night, just as
there are individual variations in circadian chronotype, and these
differences may be related to mood. Manic-depressive individuals
awakened and exposed to an acute bout of light at night
experienced
more
than
twice
the
decrease
in
melatonin
concentrations
as
individuals
not
diagnosed
with
bipolar
disorder.108 Among non-shift working adults there are far less
data available to assess the effects of chronic nighttime lighting
on mood. As described earlier, virtually all individuals living in
North America or Europe are exposed to nightly light pollution,
but there is a lack of systematic research investigating the effects.
In rodents, exposure to dim light at night (5 lux) each night for 3–
4 weeks elicited depressive-like symptoms.59,85–87 In humans, the
incidence of major depression has grown in parallel with the
adoption of electric lights, but this is only correlation. Interestingly,
the Amish population rejects electricity and has remarkably low
incidence of depression.109 Epidemiological studies are warranted
to assess this relationship.
Elderly individuals institutionalized in hospitals or nursing
facilities are particularly vulnerable to exposure to artificial light
at night because 24-h nursing activities and safety concerns
require constant lighting. Circadian disruption is already a factor in
the natural aging process, as the melatonin rhythm decreases in
amplitude and sleep becomes more fragmented.110 In a cohort of
857 elderly individuals, exposure to light at night was associated
with insomnia and poor sleep quality,111 which could be
contributing factors to depressed mood. In another cohort of
516 elderly individuals, both intensity and duration of exposure to
light at night were associated with depressive symptoms.
Depressed individuals averaged more than 5 lux of light at night
and more than 30 min of nightly exposure, compared with only
0.8 lux in the non-depressed group. Interestingly, depressive
symptoms did not correlate with melatonin concentrations.112 If
it is feasible for the particular case, then timing light exposure to a
more appropriate circadian phase could be a strategy to reduce
depression among the aged population. Among elderly patients
with dementia, sleep consolidation and behavioral disorders were
improved by morning light therapy, indicating light is powerful
both as a disruptor or synchronizer depending on the timing.113 It
is also becoming apparent that lack of exposure to bright light
during the day can contribute to mood changes. In one study,
women who had a window were exposed to higher light levels
during the day and reported better sleep and lower depressive
symptoms than women working in similar jobs, but without office
windows.114

 CONCLUSIONS AND CONSIDERATIONS
The introduction of electric light was a pivotal moment in history,
finally allowing humans greater flexibility in controlling the
environment. It led to safer, wealthier, more productive societies.
Unfortunately, the field of circadian biology lagged behind the
widespread adoption of electric light. Only now are we learning
about the effects of artificial light at night on the brain and body.
In 2007, the World Health Organization designated shift work as a
‘probable carcinogen’ after findings from epidemiological and
laboratory studies proved that light at night increases the risk of
breast cancer.4,6,115,116 In 2016, the American Medical Association
issued a report cautioning against blue-rich LED streetlights, citing
the detrimental effects on human health.117 Most recently, a
growing
scientific
consensus
suggests
that
light
at
night
negatively affects mood. This is important research because it
deals with a ubiquitous phenomenon. As the human population
expands, and developing countries further modernize their cities
and industries, light pollution will grow to affect even more
people. The list of biological systems affected by light at night is
long, but additional research will tease out the critical systems
and determine strategies to protect them from disruption by
nighttime light.
As we learn more about the interaction between light and the
brain, technology promises new solutions as well. ‘Smart’ homes
and ‘smart’ lighting fixtures use precise LEDs to adjust the
wavelength of light depending on the time of day. Apps for
smartphones, tablets and computers are available to automatically
redshift the color of the screen in the evening to a wavelength less
likely to activate ipRGCs. New street light designs are being
introduced to focus the light toward the street and avoid upward
light leakage. And heavy black out curtains impermeable to light
are being adopted for bedroom use. The average person can
employ many of these strategies themselves to minimize artificial
light at night exposure. Specialized populations, however, may
require more sophisticated solutions. For example, night shift
workers require light to perform their job duties, but there is
currently no acceptable solution to protect their circadian cycle
without sacrificing light needed for alertness and performance.
Similarly, hospital inpatients are exposed to light at night because
it is a 24/7 working environment and nurses need to care for the
patients at all hours. In this situation, blue light-blocking glasses or
sleep masks might be considered to reduce disruptive light
exposure in this vulnerable population. Future studies should
determine the minimum light intensity and spectral characteristics
required to elicit depressed mood in humans and then seek
solutions to optimize indoor and outdoor lighting to minimize
human circadian disruption. In some cases, pairing avoidance of
light at night with increased exposure to relatively bright light
during the day may be needed to ward off affective dysregulation.
Finally, the development of additional animal models of circadian
disruption and depression is also needed to discover mechanisms
underlying this relationship.118
