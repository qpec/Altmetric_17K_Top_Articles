Purpose: Sustained release hydrogel with bupivacaine (AnestaGel™) is a novel formulation 
of extended release bupivacaine in a biohydrogel Matrix™. We sought to compare the analgesic 
effects via mechanical allodynia, the pharmacokinetic characteristics via serum blood levels, 
and the local tissue effects via pathology, following injection of either sustained release hydrogel 
with bupivacaine, liposome bupivacaine, or hydrogel only (negative control group).
Materials and methods: Ninety rats (30 in each group) were randomized to receive a sciatic 
nerve block injection of either sustained release hydrogel with bupivacaine, liposome bupivacaine 
(Exparel®), or a biohydrogel matrix. The total force generated was obtained at varying time 
points. Pathologic analysis was undertaken on days 5 and 42 of the study. Six additional rats 
(two in each group) were randomized to receive a sciatic nerve block injection of either sustained 
release hydrogel with bupivacaine, liposome bupivacaine, or bupivacaine and pharmacokinetic 
data were obtained for up to 120 hours. 
Results: The sustained release hydrogel with bupivacaine group had significantly better response 
to mechanical allodynia compared to the other two groups. The pathology showed no significant 
adverse events at 42 days in any group. Finally, bupivacaine was present longer in the serum of 
sustained release hydrogel with bupivacaine group than the other two groups.
Conclusion: The sustained release hydrogel with bupivacaine achieved longer lasting anal-
gesia with no significant findings on pathology at 42 days when compared to both positive and 
negative controls.
Keywords: mechanical allodynia, local anesthetics, extended release, nerve block
Introduction
Pain management continues to remain an important part of intraoperative and post-
operative patient care. Several papers and societies have advocated for a multimodal 
analgesic approach to the management of postoperative pain, with a local anesthetic 
being a component of that approach.1–4 However, local anesthetics are limited in their 
effectiveness by their duration of action. Local anesthetics can be given via a catheter 
technique to extend their duration of action, but these techniques are sometimes more 
difficult to place and are associated with catheter dislodgement.5
Additionally, there have been several extended release formulations of local 
anesthetics developed, which prolong the duration of action of the local anesthetic.6,7 
Liposome bupivacaine (Exparel®; Pacira Pharmaceuticals Inc., Parsippany-Troy 
Hills, NJ, USA) is a multivesicular liposomal formulation of 1.3% bupivacaine. It has 
shown prolonged release compared to placebo in wound infiltration and peripheral

compared to bupivacaine hydrochloride.8–12
Sustained release hydrogel with bupivacaine ( 
AnestaGel™; 
InSitu Biologics, LLC, St Paul, MN, USA) is a novel for-
mulation of extended release bupivacaine in a biohydrogel 
Matrix™ (InSitu Biologics, LLC). This formulation allows 
for a single injection of bupivacaine hydrogel into the tissue 
to prolong the release of local anesthetic. The matrix biohy-
drogel is tunable, biocompatible, and bioabsorbable. Prior 
formulations of sustained release hydrogel with bupivacaine 
have shown prolonged efficacy, but to date, no good laboratory 
practice (GLP) studies have been performed using sustained 
release hydrogel with bupivacaine. The objectives of this 
study were to evaluate under GLP 1) the analgesic effects 
of sustained release hydrogel with bupivacaine on mechani-
cal allodynia; 2) the local tissue effects following injection 
of sustained release hydrogel with bupivacaine; and 3) the 
pharmacokinetic characteristics of sustained release hydrogel 
with bupivacaine analyzed by measuring serum blood levels.
Materials and methods
This study was conducted in accordance with the US Food 
and Drug Administration Regulations on Good Laboratory 
Practice for Nonclinical Laboratory Studies CFR Title 21 
Part 58, with the exception of blood sample processing. The 
pharmacokinetic portion of the study was not in accordance 
with GLP
, but in accordance with the medical research orga-
nization NAMSA’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Com-
mittee protocol #17-12-8, which also approved this study. 
For the GLP portion of the study, 90 Sprague Dawley male 
rats weighing 150–250 g were selected for the analgesic and 
pathologic portions of this study. An additional six Sprague 
Dawley male rats weighing between 350 and 450 g were 
chosen for the pharmacokinetic portion of the study. Thus, 
the total number of rats used in the study was 96.
Figure 1 displays a summary of the GLP portion of the 
study. These animals were received, acclimated, and verified 
to be in good health prior to use. Within 2 days of the study, 
they underwent baseline nociceptive testing to assess the 
withdrawal threshold to mechanical stimulation using elec-
tronic von Frey (eVF) fibers. Animals were randomly divided 
into three groups. The test group (n=30) received sustained 
release hydrogel with bupivacaine (Ref No. P105C, Lot No. 
NB 100.101.1865, p.1) with a two-part hydrogel formula-
tion consisting of drug reservoir particles suspended in a 
binding hydrogel matrix. Drug reservoir particles contained 
200 mg/mL 5.5% tyrosine-substituted hyaluronan (TsHA). 
The binding matrix was formulated with 10 mg/mL 1.2% 
TsHA. The overall sustained release hydrogel with bupiva-
caine dose contained 105 mg/mL of bupivacaine. The second 
group (n=30) was a positive control and received liposome 
bupivacaine (Exparel; 1.33%, NDC 65250-266-20). The third 
group (n=30) received a negative control consisting of the 
sustained release hydrogel without any bupivacaine added. 
Animals were transferred to the procedure room, anes-
thetized with inhaled isoflurane, and the left hind paw was 
prepared for aseptic surgery. Surgical creation of a 1 cm lon-
gitudinal incision along the plantar aspect of the left foot was 
performed and the incision was closed in the standard fashion. 
Following the incisional procedure, each animal received an 
injection of 0.1 mL of the corresponding treatment target-
ing the sciatic nerve between the greater trochanter and the

Analgesic effect of AnestaGel™ on mechanical allodynia
ischial tuberosity. All animals recovered from anesthesia and 
returned to their general housing area. Nociceptive testing 
was performed at 2, 6, 10, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 hours 
postinjection. Mechanical allodynia was tested using eVF 
Anesthesiometer (IITC Life Science, Woodland Hills, CA, 
USA). The testing was on the plantar surface of the ipsilat-
eral and contralateral hind paw of each animal. This was 
repeated a total of three times at each time period to obtain 
an average force number for each time period. Pressure was 
applied with the probe tip with increasing force within 1 mm 
of the midline of the incision. Animal observations occurred 
at least once a day. 
Twenty animals from each group (a total of 60 rats) sur-
vived a total of 5 days. Additionally, 10 rats from each group (a 
total of 30 rats) survived a duration of 42±3 days. All animals 
were humanely euthanized and submitted for gross necropsy. 
The injection sites of each animal, including the sciatic nerve 
and the local lymph nodes (popliteal, iliac, and/or prefemo-
ral), were collected, processed for histology, and submitted 
to a board-certified veterinary pathologist for analysis. Tis-
sue samples were prepared and hematoxylin and eosin slides 
were prepared. The pathologist tested for local effects after 
implantation, including inflammation, hemorrhage, foreign 
debris, neovascularization, and necrosis. Scoring criteria for 
pathology was on the scale of absent 0, minimal 1, mild 2, 
moderate 3, and marked 4 (Table 1). Irritant rank scores were 
also calculated. This was accomplished by totaling the implant 
scores (inflammatory cells + tissue response) for each implant 
site scored. The Group Average was equal to the sum of the 
total scores for that group divided by the number of implant 
sites, rounded to the nearest 10th. The Irritant Ranking Score 
was derived as follows: Test Article Group Average Score – 
Control Article Group Average Score = The Irritant Ranking 
Score. Nonirritant was a score of 0.0–2.9; slight irritant was 
a score of 3.0–8.9; moderate irritant was a score of 9.0–15.0; 
finally, severe irritant was a score larger than 15.0.
For the pharmacokinetic portion of the study, six male 
Sprague Dawley rats weighing between 350 and 450 g were

chosen. The six animals were divided into three groups. The 
first group (n=2) received sustained release hydrogel with 
bupivacaine (Ref No. P105C, Lot No. NB 100.101.1865, 
p.1) with a two-part hydrogel formulation consisting of 
drug reservoir particles suspended in a binding hydrogel 
matrix. Drug reservoir particles contained 200 mg/mL 5.5% 
TsHA. The binding matrix was formulated with 10 mg/mL 
1.2% TsHA. The overall sustained release hydrogel with 
bupivacaine dose contained 105 mg/mL of bupivacaine. The 
second group (n=2) was a positive control and received lipo-
some bupivacaine (1.33%, NDC 65250-266-20). The third 
group (n=2) was a positive control and received bupivacaine 
hydrochloride 0.75%. 
For the non-GLP pharmacokinetic portion of the study, 
animals were anesthetized using inhaled isoflurane, and then 
each animal received 0.1 mL injection of their corresponding 
injectate between the greater trochanter and ischial tuberos-
ity targeting the sciatic nerve. Blood sampling occurred 
via an implanted jugular catheter. The blood sampling was 
performed at 15 minutes, 45 minutes, 2 hours, 6 hours, and 
24 hours for all three groups. Then, for the sustained release 
hydrogel with bupivacaine and liposome bupivacaine groups, 
blood sampling occurred at 48, 72, 96, and 120 hours. Blood 
samples were then sent to BASi laboratory for analysis of 
serum bupivacaine levels. No further pathologic testing 
occurred in these six rats. 
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed by Technomics Research, 
LLC (Long Lake, MN, USA). The total force generated was 
analyzed using an unpaired t-test and calculated using the aver-
age force from each rat at each time point from 2 to 72 hours for 
0–72 hours and from 2 to 120 hours for 0–120 hours. The dif-
ference between the right paw and left paw was evaluated using 
a repeated-measures analysis of variance. The area under the 
curve analysis was performed using the left paw average force 
value data and the difference was tested by an unpaired t-test. 
Results
Ninety rats with 30 in each group were included in the GLP 
portion of the study testing both mechanical allodynia and 
pathology. Additionally, six rats were included in the final 
non-GLP pharmacokinetic analysis. We first analyzed the 
total force generated from 2 to 72 hours after injection in 
the left (injured) paw. We found that the sustained release 
hydrogel with bupivacaine group had significantly higher 
force generated than the control (P=0.0004; Table 2) and 
the liposome bupivacaine (P=0.0002; Table 3) groups. We 
then evaluated the total force generated from 2 to 120 hours 
after injection. The sustained release hydrogel with bupiva-
caine group had significantly higher force generated when 
compared to the control group (P=0.0024) and the liposome 
bupivacaine group (P=0.0005), as shown in Tables 2 and 3. 
Finally, we compared the right (uninjured) to left (injured) 
paw values for each group and found that the right paw 
generated significantly higher force than the left at all time 
points for all three groups (Table 4).
The results of the pathology tests illustrated that at day 5, 
five rats (out of 20) in the sustained release hydrogel with bupi-
vacaine group had pathology consistent with either minimal 
or mild nerve damage. Minimal or mild nerve damage was 
characterized as axonophagia and/or myelinophagia. On day 
42, five rats (out of 10) showed minimal nerve damage in the 
sustained release hydrogel with bupivacaine group. Neither the 
liposome bupivacaine group nor the biohydrogel matrix group 
showed any signs of nerve damage at both day 5 and day 42.
The irritant rank scores for all three groups at 5 and 42 
days are listed in Table 5. At the 5-day time point, under the

Analgesic effect of AnestaGel™ on mechanical allodynia
conditions of this study and based on the irritant rank score, 
sustained release hydrogel with bupivacaine was considered 
a moderate irritant when compared to liposome bupivacaine 
and a nonirritant when compared to the biohydrogel matrix 
group. At the 5-day time point, under the conditions of 
this study and based on the irritant rank score, liposome 
bupivacaine was considered a nonirritant when compared 
to the biohydrogel matrix group. At the 42-day time point, 
under the conditions of this study and based on the irritant 
rank score, sustained release hydrogel with bupivacaine was 
considered a slight irritant when compared to liposome bupi-
vacaine and a nonirritant when compared to the biohydrogel 
matrix group. At the 42-day time point, under the conditions 
of this study and based on the irritant rank score, liposome 
bupivacaine was considered a nonirritant when compared 
to the biohydrogel matrix group. The material present and 
the corresponding tissue response and inflammation for the 
sustained release hydrogel with bupivacaine group led to the 
ranking of moderate irritant at 5 days and slight irritant at 42 
days, compared to liposome bupivacaine. 
The pharmacokinetic data are displayed in Table 6 which 
show serum bupivacaine levels from the three groups (sus-
tained release hydrogel with bupivacaine, liposome bupiva-
caine, and bupivacaine) up through 120 hours. Six rats (who 
were not part of the mechanical allodynia and pathology 
portion of the study) were included in this analysis. The 
sustained release hydrogel with bupivacaine group showed 
serum bupivacaine cmax (peak serum concentration) levels 
at 579 and 1030 ng/mL for rats 1 and 2, respectively, both 
occurring 2 hours after injection. The cmax of rats 1 and 2 
of the liposome bupivacaine rats was 27.0 and 42.1 ng/mL, 
respectively, both occurring at 6 hours postinjection. The 
cmax of rats 1 and 2 of the bupivacaine hydrochloride group 
was 129 and 138 ng/mL, respectively, both occurring at 45 
minutes after injection. 
Discussion
This study illustrates that a single injection of sustained 
release hydrogel with bupivacaine administered near the 
sciatic nerve produced long-lasting analgesia in a rat model. 
When compared to both a negative control (sustained release 
hydrogel without bupivacaine) and a positive control (lipo-
some bupivacaine), sustained release hydrogel with bupiva-
caine performed significantly better on assessing analgesia 
via mechanical allodynia produced from a sciatic nerve injec-
tion in rats from 0 to 72 hours and from 0 to 120 hours. This 
study is based on previous rat pain models which used similar 
incisions and force testing for assessment of analgesia.13,14

It must be noted, however, that while the volumes were the 
same between sustained release hydrogel with bupivacaine 
and the positive control, the dosages of bupivacaine were dif-
ferent. The concentration of bupivacaine in sustained release 
hydrogel with bupivacaine was 105 mg/mL and in liposome 
bupivacaine was 13.3 mg/mL.
This analgesic effect of sustained release hydrogel with 
bupivacaine on the injured paw was supported by the data 
regarding the right paw. There was no significant difference 
between the right paw data when comparing sustained release 
hydrogel with bupivacaine to control and sustained release 
hydrogel with bupivacaine to liposome bupivacaine. This sug-
gests that all rats performed equally well with regards to force 
assessment via the eVF testing in their uninjured paw and, 
thus, further validates testing on the injured paw. Furthermore, 
as there were significant differences in force generation at all 
time points between the left and right paws for each group, 
we can conclude that again force assessment via the eVF was 
accurate as the injured paw performed significantly worse in 
force assessment when compared to the uninjured paw. 
Previous studies have illustrated the neurotoxic effects 
of local anesthetics.15,16 Memari et al15 illustrated that when 
bupivacaine is injected near the sciatic nerve, neuronal injury 
can occur. The neuronal injury can be characterized as either 
perineural inflammation or decreased number of myelinated 
fibers. The exact mechanism of neuronal injury is unknown; 
however, recent data from Yu et al17 suggest different mecha-
nisms depending on the type of local anesthetic used. Further-
more, they showed that as the concentration of bupivacaine 
increased, there was increased neurotoxicity. Consistent with 
these results, the sustained release hydrogel with bupivacaine 
group did show some nerve damage histologically, but this 
damage was minimal to mild at 5 days and minimal at the 
42-day time point. This likely would resolve completely over 
time. The liposome bupivacaine (positive control) group did 
not show any measurable neurotoxicity, which was similar to 
previous pathologic findings obtained when injected perineu-
rally in a porcine model.18 As described earlier, the concentra-
tion of sustained release hydrogel with bupivacaine was higher 
than that of liposome bupivacaine, which may account for the 
differences in neuronal damage on histopathology. 
Finally, the pharmacokinetic pilot study results sug-
gest that bupivacaine remained longer in the blood of rats 
that received a sciatic nerve injection of sustained release 
hydrogel with bupivacaine than after injection of bupiva-
caine hydrochloride and liposome bupivacaine, indicating 
prolonged release. In rats weighing between 350 and 450 g, 
the concentrations of bupivacaine injected were between 
23 and 30 mg/kg for sustained release hydrogel with bupi-
vacaine and 3 and 3.7 mg/kg for liposome bupivacaine. 
Thus, the differences could be related to the differences in 
the concentration of bupivacaine injected. However, even 
at a lower concentration, liposome bupivacaine failed to 
produce measurable blood levels beyond 24 hours, whereas 
the sustained release hydrogel with bupivacaine produced 
measurable serum bupivacaine levels at 72 hours in one rat 
and 96 hours in another. Serum bupivacaine cmax levels of 
the sustained release hydrogel with bupivacaine are similar 
to previous studies involving larger dosages of liposome 
bupivacaine in animals.19

Analgesic effect of AnestaGel™ on mechanical allodynia
There are two limitations of this study. The first, as 
discussed earlier, is that the concentrations of bupivacaine 
between sustained release hydrogel with bupivacaine and 
liposome bupivacaine were not equivalent. This may have 
affected the analgesic, pathologic, and pharmacokinetic dif-
ferences between the two groups. However, while this may 
be viewed as a limitation for comparison, it is an inherent 
advantage of the sustained release mechanism of action of the 
hydrogel with bupivacaine. Additionally, as the pharmacoki-
netic portion of the study consisted of only two rats in each 
group, it is difficult to draw definite conclusions regarding 
the differences observed in serum bupivacaine levels. 
Conclusion
Sustained release hydrogel with bupivacaine provides long-
lasting analgesia via release of bupivacaine from a biohydro-
gel matrix with no severe negative pathological findings in 
a rat model performed under GLP when compared to both 
positive and negative controls.
