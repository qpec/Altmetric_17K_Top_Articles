Abstract
Many studies have reported that adherence to health promo-
tion guidelines for diet, physical activity, and maintenance
of healthy body weight may decrease cancer incidence and
mortality. A systematic review was performed to examine asso-
ciations between adherence to established cancer prevention
guidelines for diet and physical activity and overall cancer inci-
dence and mortality. PubMed, Google Scholar, and Cochrane
Reviews databases were searched following the current recom-
mendations of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews
and Meta-analysis Approach (PRISMA). Twelve studies met inclu-
sion criteria for this review. High versus low adherence to
established nutrition and physical activity cancer prevention
guidelines was consistently and significantly associated with
decreases of 10% to 61% in overall cancer incidence and mor-
tality. Consistent significant reductions were also shown for
breast cancer incidence (19%–60%), endometrial cancer inci-
dence (23%–60%), and colorectal cancer incidence in both
men and women (27%–52%). Findings for lung cancer incidence
were equivocal, and no significant relationships were found
between adherence and ovarian or prostate cancers. Adhering to
cancer prevention guidelines for diet and physical activity is
consistently associated with lower risks of overall cancer inci-
dence and mortality, including for some site-specific cancers.

Introduction
An estimated 1,685,210 new cancer diagnoses and 595,690
cancer deaths are expected in the United States in 2016 (1).
Behaviors such as poor diet choices, physical inactivity, excess
alcohol consumption, and unhealthy body weight could account
for more than 20% of cancer cases and therefore be prevented with
lifestyle modifications (1). Two-thirds of U.S. cancer deaths can
also be attributed to these modifiable behaviors when including
exposure to tobacco products (2–6).
To help guide individuals and communities toward healthier
lifestyles, nutrition and physical activity guidelines for cancer pre-
vention have been designed by the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services along with leading health organizations such as the
American Cancer Society (ACS; ref. 7) and the World Cancer
Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research (WCRF/
AICR; ref. 8). These cancer prevention and health promotion guide-
lines focus on specific lifestyle recommendations to (i) achieve and
maintain a healthy weight throughout life, (ii) adopt a physically
active lifestyle; (iii) consume a healthy diet with an emphasis on
plant-based foods, and (iv) limit alcohol consumption (2).
Often epidemiologic studies attempt to parse out specific,
individual risk factors; however, examination of an overall risk
pattern also provides key information when considering health-
related behaviors which often co-occur (9). For example, a general
risk profile pattern can be ascertained by measuring adherence to
cancer prevention guidelines. A score can be constructed on the
basis of multiple lifestyle aspects including body mass index
(BMI), physical activity, alcohol intake, and various aspects of
a healthy diet such as intake of fruit and vegetables, whole grains,
and red/processed meat. Utilization of such an adherence score
would allow for investigation of overall behavior patterns.
The ACS and WCRF/AICR examine the most current, evidence-
based research on diet, physical activity, and cancer risk from
laboratory experiments, human studies, and comprehensive
reviews and then publish cancer prevention recommendations
for individuals and community action. The most recent update
from the ACS Nutrition and Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory
Committee was published in 2012 (2). The ACS guidelines
contain specific strategies to adhere to the aforementioned recom-
mendations. Similarly, WCRF/AICR guidelines focus on improv-
ing modifiable risk profiles, with the most recently published
recommendations for healthy lifestyles in 2007 (4). These recom-
mendations also proffer guidelines for remaining as lean as
possible within the normal range of body weight, being physically
active as a part of everyday life, eating mostly plant foods, limiting
intake of red meat and avoiding processed meat, limiting con-
sumption of alcohol, limiting consumption of energy dense
foods, avoiding sugary drinks, and limiting salt consumption.
The aim of the systematic review was to synthesize the evidence
from prospective cohort studies regarding adherence to the ACS
and WCRF/AICR nutrition and physical activity cancer prevention

Materials and Methods
Search strategy and identification of studies
Two independent authors (L.N. Kohler and D.O. Garcia) exe-
cuted the following comprehensive search strategy following the
current recommendations of Preferred Reporting Items for Sys-
tematic Reviews and Meta-analysis Approach (PRISMA; ref. 10).
Key search terms were used to maximize the identification of
prospective cohort studies that examined associations between
adherence to nutrition and physical activity cancer prevention
guidelines and cancer incidence and mortality. Databases were
searched in March 2016, using the following search parameters:
PubMed key terms "cancer prevention guidelines," "nutrition,"
physical activity," "adherence," "cancer incidence and/or cancer
mortality"; Google Scholar search "cancer prevention guideline
adherence AND nutrition AND physical activity AND cancer
incidence" with the exact phrase "cancer prevention guidelines"
and at least one of the words "incidence mortality"; and Cochrane
reviews strategy "adherence to nutrition physical activity cancer
prevention guidelines." Filters included human studies in English
only, articles that had full text available; and articles published
within the past 10 years. All eligible full-text articles selected for
inclusion were examined for citations of relevant studies.
Titles and abstracts were screened by two reviewers; data were
extracted by one reviewer (L.N. Kohler) and double-checked by
the second reviewer (D.O. Garcia) using a predesigned data
extraction form. Data extracted from each study included the
author's first and last names, title, publication year, study pop-
ulation (cohort and sample size), follow-up period, guidelines
utilized, and how adherence score was generated, covariates, and
study outcomes including relative risks (RR) or hazard ratios
(HRs) and confidence intervals (CI). The Critical Appraisal Skills
Programme's Making sense of evidence (11) was the predeter-
mined tool used to assess the risk of bias. The tool was used to
assess recruitment procedures, measurement of exposure, con-
founding variables, study outcomes, and generalizability. A third
reviewer (E.T. Jacobs) resolved any disagreement. The protocol
was registered with PROSPERO International Prospective Register
of systematic reviews (Ref: CRD42015026614).
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Only prospective cohort studies were eligible for inclusion, as
the focus was to ascertain cancer incidence and cancer mortality.
Minimally, studies must have collected data for physical activity
and diet, generated an adherence score on the basis of either ACS
or WCRF/AICR cancer prevention guidelines (2, 12), and reported
cancer outcomes of incidence and/or mortality to be deemed
eligible for this review. Overall cancer incidence and cancer
mortality were the primary outcomes of interest. However, site-
specific cancer risks were also considered when data were available
from at least two studies meeting the eligibility criteria. Com-
mentaries and summary documents were excluded unless they
presented additional data.
Results
A total of 2,033 potentially relevant studies were reviewed; after
removal of duplicates and exclusion on the basis of title or
abstract, 25 full articles on nutrition and physical activity cancer
prevention guideline adherence were retained for in-depth
consideration. The selection process for the articles is shown
in Fig. 1. We identified 12 articles that met the a priori criteria
for inclusion (Table 1). These studies represented analyses of data
from 10 cohorts including the Cancer Prevention Study-II (CPS-
II) nutrition cohort (13), the Women's Health Initiative (WHI)
cohort (14), the NIH-American Association of Retired Persons
(NIH-AARP) Diet and Health Study cohort (15), the Framingham
Offspring (FOS) cohort (16), the Vitamins and Lifestyle (VITAL)
Study cohort (17), the Canadian National Breast Screening Study
(CNBSS; ref. 18), the Swedish Mammography Cohort (SMC;
ref. 19), the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer
and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort (20, 21), the Southern Commu-
nity Cohort Study (SCCS; ref. 22), and the Iowa Women's
Health Study (IWHS) cohort (23). Adherence scores for these
studies were constructed utilizing recommendations from the
American Cancer Society (ACS; Table 2; ref. 7) or the World
Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research
(WCRF/AICR; Table 3; ref. 8).
Overall cancer
Seven studies evaluated the association between guideline
adherence for diet, physical activity, healthy body weight,
and alcohol consumption and overall cancer incidence and/
or mortality. After adjustment for covariates, there were
statistically significant effects of guideline adherence on can-
cer risk. Participants with high adherence to the ACS guide-
lines were less likely to develop or die from any cancer
compared with those participants who had low adherence
to the ACS guidelines (24–27). Likewise, meeting or highly
adhering to WCRF/AICR recommendations versus low or no
adherence to the recommendations also demonstrated sta-
tistically significant risk reduction in overall cancer incidence
(28) and mortality (29, 30).
The study by McCullough and colleagues (24) developed an
original scoring system to reflect adherence to the ACS guide-
lines with the goal of evaluating the association between
following the recommended guidelines and risk of death
from cancer, cardiovascular disease, and all causes. The authors
evaluated 111,966 non-smoking men and women in the CPS-II
Nutrition cohort, which is a subset of the larger CPS-II (13).
Participants were primarily healthy, Caucasian adults aged 50–
74 years from 21 states in the United States (13). The scoring
system weighted each recommendation equally from 0 to 2
possible points, with 0 points representing not meeting the
recommendation at all, 1 point for partially meeting the
recommendation, and 2 points for fully meeting the recom-
mendation. The overall adherence scores in the study popu-
lation ranged from 0 for those participants who did not follow
any of the guidelines to 8 for those participants that were fully
adherent to all 4 lifestyle factor recommendations (Table 2).
High adherence was a score of 7–8 points and low adherence
was a score of 0–2 points. McCullough and colleagues reported
a 24% reduction (RR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.65–0.89) and a 30%
reduction (RR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.61–0.80) in cancer mortality
over 14 years of follow-up for men and women, respectively,
with high adherence compared with those with low adherence
to the ACS guidelines. (24).
Thomson and colleagues (25) used similar methodology to
examine the impact of adherence to the ACS guidelines in

 65,838 postmenopausal women aged 50–79 years from the
Women's Health Initiative Observational Study (WHI-OS;
ref. 14). The WHI-OS was a prospective study of health out-
comes in postmenopausal women who were enrolled in 40 U.S.
clinical centers from 1993 to 1998 (31). Overall baseline
adherence scores were similar to those from the CPS-II cohort,
differing only slightly. The recommendation to "maintain a
healthy weight throughout life" was assessed from reported
weight at 18 years and measured at study baseline. The score for
the recommendation to "consume a healthy diet with an
emphasis on plant sources" included an extra point or 2 for
diet quality determined by being in the second or third tertile
of total carotenoids, respectively (Table 2). Similar to the pre-
vious study, the overall adherence scores ranged from 0 for
those participants not adherent to any of the guidelines to 8
for fully adherent participants and were collapsed into catego-
ries for comparison. The overall cancer incidence or mortality
analyses included a comparison of highly adherent parti-
cipants with a score of 7 or 8 compared with low adherence
participants scoring less than 2 points. Cancer-specific mortal-
ity analyses further collapsed categories of the score (0–3, 4–5,
6–8) due to smaller numbers of events. In women who had
high adherence to the ACS guidelines, Thomson and colleagues
demonstrated a 17% reduction in cancer incidence over the
12.6 years of follow-up (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.75–0.92) and
20% reduction in cancer-specific mortality (HR, 0.80; 95% CI,
0.71–0.90) compared with women with low adherence to the
ACS guidelines (25).
In the third study utilizing the ACS guidelines, nearly half a
million men and women aged 50–71 years in the NIH-AARP Diet
and Health Study (n ¼ 476,396) were included from 6 states and 2
metropolitan areas with existing population-based cancer regis-
tries from 1995–1996 (15). Adherence scores were modified
somewhat from prior ACS-based studies by using only one
baseline measurement for BMI, categorizing physical activity by
times per week instead of metabolic equivalents of task (MET)
hours per week, not including a variety or quality of diet measure,
and giving moderate drinkers (1–2 drinks per day for men and 1
drink per day for women) the most adherent score of 2 points for
the alcohol consumption recommendation (Table 2). Partici-
pants were categorized as most adherent if they scored 8–11
points and least adherent if they scored 0–3 points overall. As
shown in Table 1, Kabat and colleagues reported a statistically
significant decrease in cancer incidence over the 10.5 years
of follow-up for both highly adherent men (HR, 0.90; 95% CI,
0.87–0.93) and women (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.77–0.84). A statis-
tically significant reduction in cancer mortality was also reported
during the 12.6 years of follow-up for both highly adherent men
(HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.70–0.80) and women (HR, 0.76; 95% CI,
0.70–0.83; ref. 27).

 and overall cancer incidence utilizing the SCCS (n ¼ 61,098)
with a focus on representing low-income Whites and African
Americans in the southeastern United States. Adherence scores
ranged from 0 to 4 points with 1 point assigned for each
recommendation met upon study entry (Table 2). A compar-
ison of the most adherent participants (score ¼ 4) versus
nonadherent participants (score ¼ 0) demonstrated a nonsig-
nificant 4% reduction in overall cancer incidence (HR, 0.96;
95% CI, 0.65–1.42) in the SCCS participants. However, when
evaluating only participants free of chronic disease at baseline,
a statistically significant 45% reduction in cancer risk (HR, 0.55;
95% CI, 0.31–0.99) was found (26).
Romaguera and colleagues (28) assessed the association
between adherence to WCRF/AICR guidelines and overall can-
cer incidence as well as specific types of cancer incidence in the
EPIC cohort study (n ¼ 386,355; refs. 20, 21). The constructed
adherence score (Table 3) operationalized the WCRF/AICR
recommendations of body fatness, physical activity, intake of
food and drinks that promote weight gain, intake of plant
foods, intake of animal foods, intake of alcoholic drinks, and
breastfeeding. One point was assigned for each recommenda-
tion that was fully met, a half point was assigned for partially
meeting the recommendation, and all others received zero
points for not meeting the recommendation. For women, high
adherence to the score was denoted if the score summed to 6–7
points compared with low adherence scoring 0–3 points. For
men, high adherence was considered a score of 5–6 compared
with low adherence scoring 0–2 points. Romaguera and col-
leagues reported a statistically significant decrease in overall
cancer incidence over the 11.0 years of follow-up for both
highly adherent men (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.72–0.99) and
women (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.72–0.91). In addition, a 1-point
increment of the adherence score was associated with a statis-
tically significant 5% reduction in overall cancer incidence (HR,
0.95; 95% CI, 0.93–0.97; ref. 28).
Similarly, Vergnaud and colleagues (30) investigated wheth-
er adherence to WCRF/AICR recommendations was associated
with risk of death in the EPIC cohort study (n ¼ 378,864) after
a median follow-up time of 12.8 years (20, 21). The adherence
score (Table 3) was modeled after the previous work of
Romaguera and colleagues utilizing the same recommenda-
tions and collapsing the score into the same sex-specific high
and low adherence categories. A significant reduction in can-
cer-specific mortality was found among women who were most
adherent to WCRF/AICR recommendations (HR, 0.76; 95%
CI, 0.62–0.93). Statistical significance was not reached in
the association for men (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.69–1.07); how-
ever, an 8% to 9% reduction in risk per 1-point increase of
WCRF/AICR adherence score was statistically significant for
both men (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.89–0.95) and women (HR,
0.91; 95% CI, 0.88–0.94; ref. 30).
Finally, Hastert and colleagues (2014) also operationalized
the WCRF/AICR guidelines (Table 3) to examine the asso-
ciation between meeting guidelines on nutrition and physical
activity and cancer mortality in a cohort of men and women
(n ¼ 57,841) aged 50 to 76 years from the VITAL study (17).
Adherence to the WCRF/AICR guidelines was classified as
met or did not meet (DNM) for each of the 6 included

 recommendations (Table 2). Recommendations to limit salt
preserved foods and supplements were not considered, as the
former was not considered common in the U.S. food supply
and the latter because the guidelines did not recommend for
or against supplementation for the prevention of cancer.
Adherence was measured as follows: BMI by self-reported
height and weight, physical activity by minutes per day and
intensity, energy density, plant foods, red meat, and alcohol
based on responses to the food frequency questionnaire
(FFQ). Meeting at least five recommendations compared with
meeting none demonstrated a 61% reduction in cancer-spe-
cific mortality over 7.7 years of follow-up (HR, 0.39; 95% CI,
0.24–0.62; ref. 29).
Breast cancer
In addition to overall cancer incidence, 8 studies reported
results for female breast cancer incidence as an outcome
(25, 27, 32–35). Consistent reductions in breast cancer inci-
dence were demonstrated in the WHI, NIH-AARP, and EPIC
cohorts for high adherence to nutrition and physical activity
cancer prevention guidelines versus low adherence [HR, 0.78;
95% CI, 0.67–0.92 (ref. 25); HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.76–0.87
(ref. 27); and HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.78–0.90, respectively
(ref. 28)]. Hastert and colleagues also investigated breast
cancer incidence as an outcome using the WCRF/AICR guide-
lines in a cohort of postmenopausal women aged 50 to 76
years from the VITAL study (n ¼ 30,797). Meeting at least
five WCRF/AICR recommendations compared with meeting
none was associated with a 60% reduction in breast cancer
incidence (HR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.25–0.65). Furthermore, each
additional recommendation met was associated with an
11% reduction in breast cancer risk (HR, 0.89; 95% CI,
0.84–0.95; ref. 32). Similarly, Harris and colleagues demon-
strated a 51% reduction in breast cancer incidence (HR, 0.49;
95% CI, 0.35–0.70; ref. 33) for those most adherent (score �
6) compared with least adherent (score � 2) to the WCRF/
AICR guidelines in the primarily postmenopausal women
in the SMC (n ¼ 31,514) that were followed for 15 years
(19). Makarem and colleagues (36) also used the WCRF/AICR
guidelines to examine the relationship between meeting
the recommendations and obesity-related cancer incidence in
a sample of men and women from the FOS cohort (n ¼ 2,983;
ref. 16). Cancers were considered obesity-related if clearly or
possibly linked to excess adiposity by the ACS. Participants
received 1, 0.5, or 0 points for fully meeting, partially meeting,
or not meeting the WCRF/AICR recommendations, respectively
(Table 2). Similar to the VITAL study, HRs for every 1-unit
increment in the overall adherence score were computed for
obesity-related cancers and site-specific cancers. Conversely, no
statistically significant association was found between adher-
ence and breast cancer incidence (HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.74–1.03)
on a per-recommendation basis (36). Catsburg and colleagues
(34) operationalized both ACS and WCRF/AICR guidelines
in the CNBSS (n ¼ 47,130 WCRF, n ¼ 46,298 ACS; ref. 18).
Adherence to all 6 ACS guidelines compared with at most one
guideline was associated with a statistically significant 31%
reduction in breast cancer incidence (HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.49–
0.97). Adhering to 6 or 7 WCRF/AICR guidelines compared
with at most one guideline was associated with a 21% reduc-
tion in risk (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.57–1.10) but did not reach
statistical significance. Meeting each additional guideline was
associated with a 5% (HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.91–0.98) or 6%
(HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.91–0.98) reduction in breast cancer
incidence utilizing the WCRF/AICR and ACS recommenda-
tions, respectively (34). Most recently, Nomura and colleagues
(35) evaluated adherence to
the
WCRF/AICR guidelines
and breast cancer incidence among postmenopausal women
with and without non-modifiable risk factors in the IWHS
(n ¼ 36,626). The 8-point adherence score was collapsed into
4 categories: 0–3.5 points (low adherence), 4.0–4.5, 5.0–5.5,
6.0–8.0 (high adherence). High adherence compared with
low adherence to WCRF/AICR guidelines was significantly asso-
ciated with a reduction in breast cancer incidence (HR, 0.76;
95% CI, 0.67–0.87; ref. 35).
Colorectal cancer
A total of 4 studies reported results for colorectal cancer
specifically (25, 27, 28, 36). Significant inverse associations were
found between adherence to ACS guidelines and colorectal cancer
incidence in the WHI cohort (HR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.32–0.73;
ref. 25) as well as the NIH-AARP cohort for women (HR, 0.65;
95% CI, 0.54–0.78) and men (HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.47–0.59;
ref. 27). Consistently, a statistically significant reduction in colo-
rectal cancer was associated with higher adherence in the EPIC
cohort (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.65–0.81; ref. 28). In contrast, the FOS
cohort demonstrated no significant association for colorectal
cancer incidence and adherence to WCRF/AICR guidelines (HR,
0.87; 95% CI, 0.68–1.12; ref. 36).
Lung cancer
The association between ACS guideline adherence and lung
cancer incidence is equivocal. Three studies reported results
for the association between nutrition and physical activity
guideline adherence and lung cancer incidence (25, 27, 28). In
the NIH-AARP cohort, effect modification by sex was demon-
strated with a statistically significant inverse association found
among highly adherent men (HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.78–0.93), but
not highly adherent women (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.84–1.05;
ref. 27). Results from the WHI are consistent with these reporting
no statistical significance between lung cancer incidence in wom-
en and ACS guideline adherence (HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.81–1.60;
ref. 25). The association between high adherence and lung cancer
incidence was not statistically significant when evaluated for both
sexes combined in the EPIC study (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.74–1.00;
ref. 28).
Endometrial cancer
To date, three prospective studies have reported results for the
association between nutrition and physical activity guideline
adherence and endometrial cancer incidence. The large NIH-
AARP and EPIC cohorts both found significant inverse associa-
tions demonstrated by higher adherence and lower risk of endo-
metrial cancer (HR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.34–0.46; HR, 0.77; 95% CI,
0.62–0.94), respectively (27, 28); whereas findings from the WHI
cohort suggest no significant association (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.49–
1.09; ref. 25). Although analysis of the adherence score as a
categorical variable (high vs. low) in the latter study was not
statistically significant for risk of endometrial cancer, the overall
trend using ACS score as an ordinal variable (0–8 points) sug-
gested a significant 7% reduction in endometrial cancer incidence
(HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.87–0.98; ref. 25).

 Other cancers
Data were also available from three studies meeting the eligi-
bility criteria for ovarian (25, 27, 28) and prostate (27, 28, 36)
cancer incidence. No statistically significant associations were
found between ovarian cancer incidence and ACS guideline
adherence in the WHI or NIH-AARP cohorts or WCRF/AICR
guideline adherence in the EPIC cohort. Likewise, no significant
associations were identified for prostate cancer incidence utilizing
the ACS guidelines in the NIH-AARP cohort or the WCRF/AICR
guidelines in the EPIC or FOS cohorts.
Discussion
This systematic review included 12 studies from 10 different
prospective cohorts evaluating the association between adherence
to nutrition and physical activity cancer prevention guidelines and
cancer outcomes. High versus low adherence to ACS or WCRF/
AICR guidelines was consistently and significantly associated with
decreases of 10% to 61% in overall cancer incidence and mor-
tality. Consistent reductions were also shown for breast cancer
incidence (19%–60%), endometrial cancer incidence (23%–
60%), and colorectal cancer incidence in both men and women
(27%–52%) for those most adherent to the recommendations.
Findings from three studies that reported results for adherence
and lung cancer incidence were less clear. No significant relation-
ships were found between adherence and ovarian or prostate
cancers.
The greatest evidence for an association with the guidelines
was significant findings in 7 of 8 studies that included breast
cancer incidence as an outcome. Regarding the studies specif-
ically related to breast cancer, all 8 included women 50 years
and older, although WHI, IWHS, and VITAL cohorts included
only postmenopausal women, and the SMC cohort consisted of
primarily
postmenopausal
women.
ACS
guidelines
were
employed in the WHI, NIH-AARP, CNBSS cohorts, whereas
the WCRF/AICR guidelines were used in the VITAL, FOS, SMC,
EPIC, IWHS, and CNBSS cohorts. Unlike the other studies that
compared high adherence with low adherence, the FOS adher-
ence score was evaluated and interpreted in 1-point increments
(36). Other differences in the FOS cohort include fewer inci-
dent cases of breast cancer (n ¼ 124) and inclusion of pre- and
postmenopausal women, which may contribute to attenuation
of findings.
Significant inverse associations were also found between
adherence to the guidelines and colorectal cancer incidence in
3 of the 4 studies reviewed. The inconsistency in the FOS cohort
could be due to the difference in the set of guidelines used for
generation of adherence score, the different analytic approach
utilizing the adherence score as a continuous variable versus a
dichotomous variable (high vs. low), analyzing men and wom-
en together unlike other studies, or perhaps the number of
incident cases of colorectal cancer (n ¼ 63) in the FOS cohort
was too small to detect statistically significant associations.
Less clear were the findings from three studies that included
lung cancer as an outcome. One study reported a significant
reduction in lung cancer for only men who had high adherence
compared with men with low adherence, but not for women.
Similarly, a second study found no association for women adher-
ing to the guidelines and lung cancer and a third study had null
findings when men and women were reported together. Although
smoking status is the strongest risk factor associated with lung
cancer, broader health-related behaviors such as diet and physical
activity may have a significant role in reducing lung cancer risk
in men.
Three studies found an inverse relationship between guide-
line adherence and risk of endometrial cancer; however, only
two of those studies showed a statistically significant result for
the high versus low adherence comparison. The third study did
suggest a significant trend with higher adherence leading to
lower risk of endometrial cancer when the adherence score
was evaluated as a continuous variable.
To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review of dietary
and physical activity cancer prevention guidelines and cancer
outcomes. Strengths of this systematic review include strict
inclusion criteria to include only prospective studies that con-
structed adherence scores to the established cancer prevention
guidelines by ACS or WCRF/AICR. All of the studies contained
sizeable cohorts with multiple years of follow-up leading to
sufficient sample sizes, ample power to detect associations, and
sufficient number of outcomes, enabling them to evaluate
associations for some site-specific cancers. However, there are
also some limitations that must be considered. First, all studies
generated their own adherence scores on the basis of recom-
mendations from either the ACS or WCRF/AICR. Most studies
assigned points for meeting or partially meeting recommenda-
tions, whereas others categorized adherence as "met" or "did
not meet" recommendations. Including multiple levels of expo-
sure may better capture the degree of adherence to the guide-
lines. Although ACS and WCRF/AICR guidelines are very sim-
ilar, interpretations of how to measure the recommendations
varied. Notably, physical activity was assessed several ways
including in metabolic equivalents, times per week, and even
a physical activity index. Furthermore, studies utilized frequen-
cy questionnaires to capture diet and physical activity data.
These self-reported measures are well-known sources of mea-
surement error, which may bias findings toward the null,
lending to conservative findings in this review. Components
of the adherence score were measured singularly at baseline
and used to assess cancer risk over time. Repeated measure-
ments of diet and physical activity may have provided an
improved exposure assessment of long-term behavior and risk
over time. Follow-up times ranged from 7.7 to 14 years, which
may not be sufficient for assessing the protective role of adher-
ence to nutrition and physical activity cancer prevention guide-
lines. In addition, although the studies evaluated large cohorts,
there was limited population heterogeneity with regard to
race or ethnicity, with the exception of the WHI and SCCS
studies. Furthermore, analyses varied somewhat among the
studies. All studies evaluating associations with ACS guideline
adherence made comparisons of high versus low adherence.
One study used WCRF/AICR guidelines to compare "met"
versus "did not meet" recommendations (29), whereas a single
study evaluated adherence to WCRF/AICR guidelines on the
basis of point increments of the overall score (36). Finally,
the potential for publication bias is always of concern. Studies
with significant findings are more likely to be published than
those with null or unimportant findings. Grey literature was
included in the search via Google Scholar in an attempt to cap-
ture any work that hasn't been formally published (abstracts,
conference proceedings, etc.). Even though the studies differed
in some measurements of individual score components, con-
struction of the adherence score, specifics of the set of guidelines

 used, and analytic methods, it is important to note that studies
generally demonstrated agreement in their findings even across
countries with varying diet and physical activity patterns.
In conclusion, strong and consistent evidence from 10 large
prospective cohorts in 12 publications indicates that adherence to
ACS and WCRF/AICR cancer prevention guidelines was associated
with significant reductions in cancer incidence and cancer mor-
tality for both men and women. In addition, significant inverse
associations were consistently found between guideline adher-
ence and breast, colorectal, and endometrial cancer incidence.
Adherence to a pattern of healthy behaviors, as outlined in cancer
prevention guidelines from either the ACS or WCRF/AICR, may
reduce cancer incidence and mortality.
