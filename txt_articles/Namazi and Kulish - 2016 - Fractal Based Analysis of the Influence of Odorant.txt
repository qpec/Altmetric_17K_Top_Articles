Fractal Based Analysis of the 
Influence of Odorants on Heart 
Activity
Hamidreza Namazi & Vladimir V. Kulish
An important challenge in heart research is to make the relation between the features of external 
stimuli and heart activity. Olfactory stimulation is an important type of stimulation that affects the 
heart activity, which is mapped on Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal. Yet, no one has discovered any 
relation between the structures of olfactory stimuli and the ECG signal. This study investigates the 
relation between the structures of heart rate and the olfactory stimulus (odorant). We show that the 
complexity of the heart rate is coupled with the molecular complexity of the odorant, where more 
structurally complex odorant causes less fractal heart rate. Also, odorant having higher entropy causes 
the heart rate having lower approximate entropy. The method discussed here can be applied and 
investigated in case of patients with heart diseases as the rehabilitation purpose.
Electrocardiography (ECG or EKG) is the process of recording the electrical activity of the heart over a period of 
time using electrodes placed on the skin. ECG has been used widely by scientists for monitoring heart activity. 
Besides analyzing the nature of ECG signal, many scientists have tried to analyze the influence of different kinds 
of external stimulation on heart activity. The works reported on analyzing the influence of auditory1–3, visual4–6 
and olfactory stimuli7–9 are noteworthy to mention.
One useful method to study different types of biological signals is fractal method. A fractal is a natural phe-
nomenon or a mathematical set that exhibits a repeating pattern displaying at every scale (self-similar). The 
scaling rules are characterized by “scaling exponents” (dimension). “Simple” regular fractals have integer scal-
ing dimensions. Complex self-similar objects have non-integer dimension. Fractals can be defined as geometric 
objects whose scaling exponent (dimension) satisfies the Szpilrajn inequality10:
ℵ ≥ D
(1)
T
where ℵ is the scaling exponent (dimension) of the object and DT is its topological dimension, that is, Euclidean 
dimension of units from which the fractal object is built. In fact, Fractal and Euclidean geometries are conjugate 
approaches. Fractal geometry builds complex objects by applying simple processes to complex building blocks; 
Euclidean geometry uses simpler building blocks but frequently requires complex building processes10. Fractal 
time series shows the long-range correlations, meaning that each fluctuation in the time series is correlated with 
last fluctuations (memory concept), where the correlations change based on power law11. Fractal theory has been 
used widely in biology and medicine for various cases such as DNA12, eye movement13, EEG signal14, bone structure15, 
respiration signal16, human stride time series17 and face18.
In case of using fractal theory for analysis of ECG signals many works have been reported in literatures. 
D’
Addio et al.19 performed fractal analysis on cardiac patients during resting, stress, early and late recovery phases 
of ECG stress test. They found out a significant change in fractal dimension values from resting to stress phase. In 
another work, Bhaduri and Ghosh20 did the fractal analysis on ECG signal of subjects performing Kundalini Yoga 
and Chi meditation. The result of their study showed enhancing complexity of the cardiac dynamics during med-
itation. Ghosh et al.21 used fractal analysis for comparison of ECG signal between healthy subjects and subjects 
suffering from Intracardiac Atrial Fibrillation. The result of their analysis showed that fractal dimension in case 
of Intracardiac Atrial Fibrillation has significant higher values compared to the normal ECG signal. This result 
indicates increasing ECG complexity for Intracardiac Atrial Fibrillation. See also22–24.
On the other hand, some researchers have focused on analyzing the entropy of ECG signal. They have 
employed different types of entropy for this purpose. For instance Kamath25 examined Renyi and Shannon

entropy for discriminating normal and Ventricular. tachycardia or fibrillation (VT-VF) subjects. He found out 
that Renyi entropy outperforms Shannon entropy for this purpose with very high sensitivity, specificity, predic-
tively and accuracy. In another work, Joseph et al.26 analyzed the effect of reflexological stimulation on heart rate 
variability. The result of their study showed the increment of Kolmogorov–Sinai entropy in reflexological stim-
ulation compare to relaxed sitting, which indicates that the ECG signal becomes more random with reflexology. 
Baumert et al.27 explored the influence of head-up tilt and mental arithmetic stress on beat-to-beat variability of 
heart rate and QT interval, by computing sample entropy and cross-sample entropy. Based on their founding, 
head-up tilt resulted in a significant reduction in sample entropy of R-R intervals and cross-sample entropy, while 
mental arithmetic stress resulted in a significant reduction in coupling directed from R-R to QT. See also28–30.
Besides all the efforts done on the analysis of ECG signal using fractal approach, no work has been reported 
that studies the influence of olfactory stimulus (odorant in this research) on fractal dynamics of ECG signal. In 
this research, we hypothesize that there should be a correlation between odorant’s molecular complexity and the 
ECG signal fractal dynamics. In another step, we analyze the correlation between entropy of odorant and ECG 
signal.
Method
In order to investigate the effect of odorant’s complexity on fractality of heart rate, the odorant’s complexity 
should be quantified. For this purpose, we considered the molecular complexity of odorants. In general, bigger 
and/or less symmetric molecules have higher molecular complexity. The molecular complexity (C) of an odorant 
is defined using Bertz formula31:
=
+

In this equation, Cn and Ce are functions of bond connectivity (n) and element diversity or kinds of atoms 
respectively.
The fractal dimension can be determined using some methods that approximate scaling and detail from lim-
its estimated from regression lines over log vs. log plots of size vs. scale. There are several formal mathematical 
definitions such as box counting, information dimension and correlation dimension for computation of fractal 
dimension32. All these methods can be seen as special cases of a continuous spectrum of generalized fractal 
dimensions. Here we define this generalized fractal dimension. The fractal exponent is based on the entropy con-
cept for a probability distribution33. For instance in case of a time series with range of variation between Vmax and 
Vmin, we can divide the total range into N bin, where each bin has the size of δ ∈ :

As another parameter to investigate, we study the influence of odorant’s entropy at 25 °C on the entropy of 
heart rate. As it is known, at 0 °K odorants have zero entropy and as the temperature increases, their entropy 
increases.
In order to investigate the influence of odorant’s complexity and entropy on fractality and entropy of heart 
rate, we selected five pleasant odorants (look at Table 1) from Fenaroli’s Handbook of Flavor Ingredients35.

As it is shown Table 1, the odorants have molecular complexities in the range of 55.4 (Benzyl alcohol) and 
177 (Diethyl malate). The molecular structures of selected odorants are shown in Fig. 1. It was mentioned that in 
general, bigger and/or less symmetric molecules have higher molecular complexity.
Also, as it is shown in Table 1, the odorants have entropy in the range of 85.55 (Benzyl alcohol) to 145.50 
(Diethyl malate). The values of odorants’ entropies in 25 °C were collected from (http://realtime.molinstincts.
com/).
Data collection. 
The experiments were conducted on forty healthy students (look at Table 2). A physician 
examined subjects before the experiment to ensure that subjects are healthy. Subjects did not drink beverages 
which contain alcohol/caffeine within 48 hours before the experiments.
We have explained the study to subjects and then collected the informed consent from them. The Internal 
Review Board of Nanyang Technological University approved all procedures (including experimentation on 
human subjects), and we did our study based on the approved guidelines.
As un-wanted external stimuli can affect the data recording, we did the experiments in an isolated room from 
external stimuli. Subjects were lying down on the bed comfortably (supine position) during the data collection 
and instructed to focus on their breathing without doing any other job.
In order to find out the most effective concentration for each odorant, we did the preliminary experiments 
which analyze the effect of changing of odorants’ concentrations (by dilution) on the fractal dimension and 
approximate entropy of heart rate. We found out that odorant concentration in the range of “detection threshold” 
did not cause any significant change in heart rate, but odorant concentration over “recognition threshold” affected 
the heart rate. We found the most effective concentration for each odorant by considering the pleasantness level of 
odorant sensed by subjects, the allowable level that heart rate can be increased/decreased in the experiments and 
also task difficulty. The selected odorants showed the similar level for the most effective concentration. So, for our 
main experiments, we diluted odorants in mineral oil in order to equalize their concentrations in the observed 
most effective level and achieved an approximate gas-phase partial pressure of 1 Pa. We also measured the con-
centrations of odorants using an olfactometer which was connected to a gas analyzer, to ensure that the resulting 
vapor concentrations did not differ. The presentation of each odorant to gas analyzer was done 5 times (each time 
for 3 seconds) with inter-stimulus interval of 2 minutes.
We have noninvasively recorded ECG signal (cardioscope Oli Monitor 432, Kone Instrument Division) from 
the left middle finger, and analog-to-digitally converted with a sampling rate of 200 Hz. Data acquisition was ini-
tiated 15 min after the start of experiment to have stabilized hemodynamics. During measurement, the breathing 
of subjects was paced (breathing rate was 0.25 Hz) with a sound signal.
At first, the data collection was done free of any stimulus. Then, we presented different odorants in separate 
experiments to the subject’ nose using a 10 ml vial, and subject sniffed the odorants, and we recorded the ECG 
signal for 3 minutes. It is noteworthy we considered inter-stimulus time of 15 minutes between different odorants’ 
presentations.
In the second day, we repeated the data collection where in total two trials were collected from each subject for 
each stimulus. A physician controlled all experiments.
Data analysis. 
After data collection, the physician checked all recorded heart rate data to ensure they are nor-
mal. All data were normal. So, we didn’t exclude any recorded data from analysis. Since the recorded ECG signal 
is noisy, in order to find heart rate (expressed in terms of R-R interval time series) we needed to filter the ECG

signal. For this purpose we wrote a set of codes to do filtering. The low-frequency cutoff (high-pass filter) was 
set at 0.05 and 0.5 Hz. Low-pass filters were set at 40, 100, and 150 Hz (high-frequency cutoff). After filtering of 
the signal, another algorithm detects QRS complex (look at Fig. 2) followed by interpolation of R peaks. The R-R 
intervals36 were detected with a temporal resolution of 2 ms and then the R-R interval time series was generated.
The generated R-R interval time series were processed for computing of fractal dimension and entropy using 
other code. The written code computed the fractal dimension and entropy of R-R interval time series based on 
Box counting method37 and approximate entropy techniques38 respectively. Approximate entropy is indicator of 
randomness of time series where lower value of approximate entropy stands for less randomness. It is noteworthy 
that size of 11 was chosen for boxes based on literatures39–41. Also, the embedded time delay of 1 was chosen. All 
of these analyses were done in MATLAB.
Statistical analysis. 
Mean values of fractal exponent and approximate entropy for the R-R interval time 
series were compared between different conditions using one-way repeated measures ANOVA. Mauchly’s test 
(α = 
 0.05) was conducted to test the sphericity. In fact, Mauchly’s sphericity test is a statistical test used to vali-
date a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). Trend analysis was conducted based on the odorants’ 
properties. Omega squared (ω2) was used for a repeated measures design. Effect size, r was employed for pairwise 
comparisons. The statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (ver. 16.0).
Results
Mauchly’s test indicated that the assumption of sphericity had not been violated in case of outcomes (fractal expo-
nent and approximate entropy of R-R interval time series). The variations of fractal dimension for R-R interval 
time series due to different odorants and the odorants’ molecular complexities are shown in Fig. 3. The results 
stand for the mean values.

variation in the fractality of R-R interval time series than Diethyl succinate, followed by Diethyl malonate, 
Dimethyl succinate and Benzyl alcohol respectively, reflecting the trend of molecular complexity of the odorants. 
The effect sizes in Table 3 show that Diethyl malate caused the greatest change in the fractality of R-R interval 
time series.

Conclusion and Discussion
In this research we studied the effect of odorant’s complexity and entropy on fractality and approximate entropy 
of heart rate. Our results demonstrated the relation between heart rate and olfactory stimulus (odorant in this 
research), as the trend of the complexity of odorants is reflected on the trend of the reduction of fractality of R-R 
interval time series. For instance, Diethyl malate with highest value of molecular complexity caused greatest 
variation in fractality of R-R interval time series, compared to other odorants. This behaviour was seen in com-
parison between other odorants as well. On the other hand, the result of our analysis showed the similar trend 
of variations in case of odorant’s entropy and the approximate entropy of R-R interval time series. In overall, the 
correlation between characteristics of odorant and heart rate was observed, where the odorant having higher 
complexity and entropy causes the greater change in fractality and entropy of heart rate.
In fact, our study showed that beside the variation of heart rate due to olfactory stimulation, the characteristics 
of heart rate and olfactory stimulus are related. It means that our investigation is one step forward compared to 
studies that just investigated the influence of odorants on heart rate variability. In this way, the works which inves-
tigated heart rate variability due to olfactory stimulation using lemon and rose aromas42, sweet fennel oil43, sweet 
orange aroma44 and lavender45 are noteworthy to mention.
The behavior seen in this research can be explained through heart-brain connection. As it is known, heart 
activity is controlled by the nervous system where the brain is on its top. When human smells an odorant, olfac-
tory neurons (as receptor cells) detect odor molecules and transmit information about the odor to the brain 
in a process called sensory transduction which yields to perception46. Based on the research done by Kermen 
 
et al.47, high complexity odorants activate more types of olfactory receptor than low complexity odorants. Thus, 
accordingly more information will be sent to the brain. Then, they will have stronger effect on the brain. Also, in 
ref. 48 we showed that complexity and entropy of the EEG signal (as a feature of brain activity) is coupled with the 
molecular complexity and entropy of the odorant, where more structurally complex odorants have greater effect 
on the EEG signal. On the other hand, based on the founding of scientists about the correlation between heart 
and brain through complexity analysis of EEG and ECG49,50, we hypothesize that the stronger effect on human 
brain which was caused by a more complex odorant, will shows its greater effect on the ECG signal, which is 
mapped on greater variation of its fractal dimension and entropy. This hypothesis needs to be worked on more by 
simultaneous analysis of the effects of different odorants with different molecular complexities on human EEG 
and ECG signals.
In this research, we did our analysis on healthy subjects. Several scientists have analyzed the effect of external 
stimulation on the heart rate of patients with different heart diseases. The works on analysis of the influence of 
lavender51,52, and the blend of oils of lemon, lavender, and ylang ylang53 as aromas on heart rate variability of 
patients are noteworthy to mention. In further attempts, our method also may be investigated in analysis of the 
influence of odorants on the heart rate of patients suffering from different heart diseases, where the diseases affect 
their heart rate. If our method works well in that case, we can continue our attempts with the rehabilitation pur-
pose. Also, in further investigation, the method used in this research can be investigate in case of analysis of the 
influence of other kinds of external stimuli on heart activity.
Also, our analyses can help the current efforts for modeling of heart reaction to external stimulation. For 
instance, the result of our investigation in this research can be linked with our Fractional Diffusion Model of brain 
reaction to external stimulation in ref. 11, in order to write the observed correlation in the mathematical form.
