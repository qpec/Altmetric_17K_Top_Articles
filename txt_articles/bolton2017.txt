IMPORTANCE Osteoporotic fractures are a leading cause of disability, costs, and mortality.
FRAX is a tool used to assess fracture risk in the general population. Mental disorders and
medications to treat them have been reported to adversely affect bone health, but, to date,
they have not been systematically studied in relation to osteoporotic fractures.
OBJECTIVE To examine the association of mental disorders and psychotropic medication use
with osteoporotic fracture risk in routine clinical practice.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this population-based cohort study, bone mineral
density and risk factors were used to calculate FRAX scores using data from the Manitoba
Bone Density Program database of all women and men 40 years of age or older in Manitoba,
Canada, referred for a baseline dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scan from January 1, 1996,
to March 28, 2013. Population-based health services data were used to identify primary
mental disorders during the 3 prior years, psychotropic medication use during the prior year,
and incident fractures. Cox proportional hazards regression models estimated the risk for
incident fractures based on mental disorders and use of psychotropic medications. Data
analysis was conducted from November 25, 2013, to October 15, 2016.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Incident nontraumatic major osteoporotic fractures (MOFs)
and hip fractures.
RESULTS Of the 68 730 individuals (62 275 women and 6455 men; mean age, 64.2 [11.2]
years) in the study, during 485 322 person-years (median, 6.7 years) of observation, 5750
(8.4%) sustained an incident MOF, 1579 (2.3%) sustained an incident hip fracture, and 8998
(13.1%) died. In analyses adjusted for FRAX score, depression was associated with MOF
(adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.39; 95% CI, 1.27-1.51; P < .05) and hip fracture (aHR, 1.43; 95%
CI, 1.22-1.69; P < .05) before adjustment for medication use, but these associations were not
significant after adjustment for medication use. In contrast, the use of selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors (aHR for MOF, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.27-1.60; P < .05; aHR for hip fracture, 1.48;
95% CI, 1.18-1.85; P < .05), antipsychotics (aHR for MOF, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.15-1.77; P < .05; aHR
for hip fracture, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.52-3.02; P < .05), and benzodiazepines (aHR for MOF, 1.15;
95% CI, 1.04-1.26; P < .05; aHR for hip fracture, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.05-1.47; P < .05) were each
independently associated with significantly increased risk for both MOF and hip fracture.
FRAX significantly underestimated the 10-year risk of MOF by 29% and of hip fracture by 51%
for those with depression. It also underestimated the 10-year risk of MOF by 36% for use of
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, by 63% for use of mood stabilizers, by 60% for use of
antipsychotics, and by 13% for use of benzodiazepines. FRAX underestimated the 10-year risk
of hip fracture by 57% for use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, by 98% for use of
mood stabilizers, by 171% for use of antipsychotics, and by 31% for use of benzodiazepines.
FRAX correctly estimated fracture risk in people without mental disorders and those not
taking psychotropic medications.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Mental disorders and medication use were associated with an
increased risk for fracture, but in simultaneous analyses, only medication use was
independently associated with fracture. Depression and psychotropic medication use are
potential risk indicators that are independent of FRAX estimates.

ental disorders affected 18% of adults in the United
States in 2013, including 15% of those 50 years of age
or older.1 Psychotropic medications are among the
most highly prescribed agents in the United States, with 330
million prescriptions for antidepressants and anxiolytics in
2009.2 In Canada, 17% of women 45 to 64 years of age take an-
tidepressant medications, making these agents the most com-
monly used in that demographic subgroup.3 Mental disor-
derssuchasdepressionhavebeenassociatedwithanincreased
risk of osteoporosis and fracture.4 Likewise, specific psycho-
tropic medications have been consistently associated with
lower bone mineral density (BMD) and increased risk of frac-
ture, independent of the mental disorders they are treating.5-9
Fractures are associated with increased morbidity, mor-
tality, disability, and cost and thus represent an important tar-
getforpublichealthpreventionefforts.10-12Osteoporosis,adis-
order manifested by reduced density and quality of bone with
susceptibility to fragility fractures, is also highly prevalent; a
50-year-old white woman has a 15% to 20% lifetime risk of hip
fracture and a 50% risk of any osteoporotic fracture.13 The frac-
ture risk assessment tool FRAX (Centre for Metabolic Bone Dis-
eases, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK) is based on eas-
ily assessed risk factors identified in meta-analyses of
population-based prospective cohorts and estimates 10-year
probabilityforamajorosteoporoticfracture(MOF)(ie,hip,ver-
tebral [clinical], humerus, or forearm) or for a hip fracture.14,15
FRAX has been incorporated into more than 100 clinical guide-
lines worldwide for osteoporosis management.16,17 However,
thereremainclinicalfactorsthatcontributetofractureriskthat
are not included in the FRAX algorithm.18 Some examples in-
clude types 1 and 2 diabetes, heart failure, falls, and certain
medications that contribute to the risk of falls such as antihy-
pertensive and psychotropic medications.19-23 Identifying ad-
ditional factors that influence the ability of FRAX to estimate
fracture risk within specific populations is therefore impor-
tant to inform practitioners how to interpret FRAX results
within these populations.
Mental disorders and the psychotropic medications used
to treat these disorders represent another potentially impor-
tant set of risk factors that have not previously been exam-
ined in the context of FRAX. Therefore, using a large clinical
dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan registry linked
to administrative health data sets that contain physician-
diagnosed mental disorders and detailed medication infor-
mation, our objective was to provide, to our knowledge, a first-
ever assessment of the performance of FRAX in routine clinical
practice for men and women with mental disorders and/or
using psychotropic medications, and to determine whether
these disorders and medications contribute to fracture risk
beyond the risk estimated by the FRAX tool.
Methods
Data Sources
Data for this study comprised the Manitoba Bone Density
Program database, which contains information on all indi-
viduals in the province of Manitoba, Canada (population, 1.2
million), who have received a DXA assessment of BMD since
1990. This database is linked through an encrypted personal
health number to data sets in the population-based Manitoba
Centre for Health Policy Data Repository. Specific repository
databases used in this study included physician billing claims
andhospitaldischargeabstracts(whichtogetherprovideddata
on mental disorders, fractures, and medical illnesses contrib-
uting to the FRAX score), vital statistics (mortality), and the
provincial drug database (containing information on medica-
tion type, dose, and date of dispensation for the entire popu-
lation).Patientdemographicinformationwasobtainedthrough
the population registry file. The accuracy and completeness
of these data sets are excellent and have been described in
detail.24-27 The study was approved by the University of Mani-
toba Human Research Ethics Board. Participant consent is
waived for administrative data studies under the Personal
Health Information Act of Manitoba.
Study Population
The study included men and women 40 years of age or older
at the time of baseline BMD assessment during the period from
January 1, 1996, to March 28, 2013. The cohort consisted of
68 730 individuals (62 275 women and 6455 men; mean [SD]
age, 64.2 [11.2] years). Individuals were included in the study
cohort if they had continuous medical coverage in Manitoba.
Mental Disorders
The mental disorders examined included depression, anxi-
ety disorders, and schizophrenia. Disorders were ascertained
using International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision,
Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) and International Statistical
Classification of Diseases and Health Related Problems, Tenth
Revision, Canada (ICD-10-CA) codes. Disorders were coded as
present if 2 or more diagnostic codes for the same disorder
(eAppendix 1 in the Supplement) occurred in either hospital
discharge abstracts or physician billing claims in the 3 years
priortoDXAscan.Forindividualswithcodesfordifferentmen-
tal disorders, a diagnosis was assigned based on the most fre-
quently coded diagnosis using definitions based on previous
work from the same databases.28 Mental disorder severity
Key Points
Question How do mental disorders and psychotropic medications
affect fracture risk estimates with FRAX, a tool developed for
clinical use in the general population?
Findings In this longitudinal cohort drawn from a
population-based registry, FRAX scores were calculated for
68 730 individuals. FRAX significantly underestimated 10-year hip
fracture risk in those with depression by 51% and in those using
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors by 57%, those using mood
stabilizers by 98%, those using antipsychotics by 171%, and those
using benzodiazepines by 31%.
Meaning Depression and some psychotropic medications are
associated with an increased risk of fracture that is not fully
captured by FRAX scores.

 scores were created based on increasing numbers of outpa-
tient visits (2, 3-5, or ≥6) or hospitalizations (1, 2, or ≥3) asso-
ciated with mental disorders.
Psychotropic Medications
Exposure to psychotropic medications during the year prior
to the DXA scan was ascertained using the World Health Or-
ganization Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification
System (eAppendix 2 in the Supplement). A 1-year time frame
was chosen to capture a more proximate medication expo-
sure. Categories included selective serotonin reuptake inhibi-
tors (SSRIs), tricyclic antidepressants, other antidepressants,
lithium, nonlithium mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, and
benzodiazepines. Exposure was arbitrarily defined as dis-
pensed prescriptions covering more than 50% of days during
the year (medication possession ratio, >0.5).
Fracture Outcomes
The primary study outcome was an incident hip fracture or
MOF occurring between the date of the baseline BMD assess-
ment and the end of the observation period (March 31, 2013,
unless coverage was terminated by death or migration out of
province). Major osteoporotic fractures included hip, verte-
bral (clinical), humerus, or forearm fractures. Fracture defi-
nitions were based on ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CA codes adapted
from algorithms validated in Canadian administrative data-
bases (eAppendix 1 in the Supplement).29 Fractures indi-
cating a high level of trauma were excluded using relevant
ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CA codes.
Fracture Risk Assessment
Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scans of the hip and spine
were performed and analyzed in accordance with manufac-
turer recommendations using one of the Manitoba Bone Den-
sity Program’
s cross-calibrated DXA instruments (the Lunar
DPXpriorto2000andtheGELunarProdigyin2000andthere-
after; both General Electric). Femoral neck T scores were cal-
culated using US National Health and Nutrition Examination
SurveyIII30whitefemalereferencevaluesasrequiredbyFRAX.
Ten-year probabilities of incident hip fracture and MOF,
including femoral neck BMD, were calculated using the FRAX
tool calibrated for the Canadian population (FRAX Desktop
Multi-Patient Entry, version 3.7) from nationwide data.31 Age
and sex at BMD assessment were determined using the popu-
lation registry file. Height and weight were obtained by self-
report prior to 2000 and objectively in 2000 and thereafter
using a wall-mounted stadiometer for height and a scale for
weight. A diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis was ascertained
using ICD codes from hospital separation abstracts and out-
patient physician visits. Chronic obstructive pulmonary dis-
ease and alcohol or substance abuse diagnoses were identi-
fied from the same sources and used as proxy measures for
smokingandhighalcoholuse.Similarprevalenceestimatesand
effects on fracture have previously been shown using these
proxydefinitionsaswasseeninpopulation-baseddata.32,33Pa-
rental hip fracture was self-reported by participants from 2005
onward; prior to 2005, we applied an age- and sex-specific ad-
justment for the effect of missing parental hip fracture, as pre-
viouslydescribed.32Prolongeduseofglucocorticoids(≥90days)
in the year prior to BMD assessment was ascertained using the
provincial drug database. FRAX input variables constructed
using these definitions have been shown to be adequate sur-
rogates in terms of prevalence and risk estimation.32,33 Al-
though not a component of FRAX, we also ascertained the use
ofosteoporosismedication(>180days)intheyearpriortoBMD
assessment (bisphosphonates, calcitonin, systemic estrogen
products, raloxifene, or teriparatide) as done in previous
studies.19UnderCanadianclinicalpracticeguidelines,aTscore
in the osteoporotic range might not require osteoporosis treat-
ment unless fracture probability is also high.34
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was conducted from November 25, 2013,
to October 15, 2016. The prevalence of FRAX risk factors, men-
tal disorders, and the use of psychotropic medications was
compared between individuals with incident fractures and
those without incident fractures using analysis of variance and
χ2 tests of independence. All analyses were conducted sepa-
rately for MOF and hip fracture. Cox proportional hazards re-
gressionanalysisyieldedadjustedhazardratios(aHRs)and95%
CIs for fractures associated with mental disorders (compared
with no mental disorder) and the use of psychotropic medi-
cations in the year prior to the index BMD (compared with no
use). Results were adjusted for FRAX score and prior use of os-
teoporosismedications.Twomodelswerefittothedata:model
1examinedmentaldisordersandtheuseofpsychotropicmedi-
cations separately, while model 2 examined mental disorders
and the use of psychotropic medications simultaneously. Vali-
dation of a prognostic model should include an evaluation of
both discrimination and calibration.35 Discrimination is the
ability of a predictive model (FRAX) to distinguish between in-
dividuals who do or do not experience the outcome (frac-
ture). Fracture discrimination using FRAX was estimated for
the subgroups of mental disorders and psychotropic medica-
tions and was expressed as the aHR per SD increase. Within
the same subgroups, calibration of the FRAX model was as-
sessed, where calibration was determined from the differ-
ence between the observed cumulative fracture probability at
10 years and the expected 10-year fracture probability esti-
mated by FRAX. Assessment of calibration considered the ef-
fect of competing mortality on the 10-year cumulative inci-
dence for fracture (ie, a fracture outcome cannot be incurred
following death), which is a component of the FRAX method.
Expected probability within 10% of observed probability was
considered to indicate good calibration.36

action analyses were performed for mental disorders and use
of psychotropic medications vs (1) sex, (2) age, (3) FRAX prob-
ability, (4) World Health Organization category or prior hip
or spine fracture, (5) osteoporosis treatment prior to BMD, and
(6) osteoporosis treatment subsequent to BMD. Statistical
analyses were performed with Statistica, version 10.0 (Stat-
Soft Inc). A 2-sided P < .05 was set as the threshold for assess-
ing statistical significance.
Results
The overall rate of mental disorders was 18.9% (n = 12 982),
with the most common diagnosis being depression (6604 of
12 982 [50.9%]). Psychotropic medication use was recorded in
17.4% of the sample (n = 11 938), and 2468 of these individu-
als (20.7%) were taking multiple psychotropics.
During 485 322 person-years (68 730 persons; median, 6.7
years) of observation, 5750 (8.4%) sustained an incident MOF,

separately,depression(aHR,1.39;95%CI,1.27-1.51),anxietydis-
orders (aHR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.09-1.30), and schizophrenia (aHR,
1.82; 95% CI, 1.16-2.85) were all significantly associated with
MOF. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, antipsychotics,
and benzodiazepines were associated with both MOF and hip
fracture: for MOF, SSRIs had an aHR of 1.47 (95% CI, 1.32-1.63),
antipsychotics had an aHR of 1.48 (95% CI, 1.21-1.81), and ben-
zodiazepines had an aHR of 1.16 (95% CI, 1.05-1.28), and for hip
fracture, SSRIs had an aHR of 1.51 (95% CI, 1.22-1.85), antipsy-
chotics had an aHR of 2.18 (95% CI, 1.58-3.02), and benzodiaz-
epines had an aHR of 1.23 (95% CI, 1.04-1.45). Similar results
were observed for psychotropic medications when mental
disorders and use of psychotropic medications were analyzed
simultaneously (model 2), but aHRs for mental disorders with
MOF and hip fracture became nonsignificant.

score for incident MOF, there was approximately a doubling in
the aHR for MOF in all subgroups, ranging from 1.87 (95% CI,
1.55-2.25) for antipsychotics to 2.69 (95% CI, 1.48-4.88) for
lithium. The gradient of risk for incident hip fracture was even
steeper, with aHRs that ranged from 3.28 (95% CI, 2.00-5.38)
for mood stabilizers to 5.60 (95% CI, 4.38-7.15) for diagnosed
anxiety disorder. No statistically significant interactions were
detected between FRAX scores in association with both men-
tal disorders and use of psychotropic medications, suggesting
thatthefracturediscriminationforthosewithmentaldisorders
and the use of psychotropic medications are similar to those in
the general population.
Figure 1 presents the observed vs expected 10-year frac-
ture probability for MOF, and Figure 2 presents the observed
vs expected 10-year fracture probability for hip fracture. In the
absence of mental disorders or psychotropic medication ex-
posure, the observed fracture probability was within 10% of
expected for both MOF and hip fracture, indicating good cali-
bration. FRAX underestimated the 10-year risk of MOF by 29%
for those with depression, by 36% for those exposed to SSRIs,
by63%forthoseusingmoodstabilizers,by60%forthoseusing
antipsychotics, and by 13% for those using benzodiazepines.
Similarly, FRAX underestimated the 10-year hip fracture risk
by 51% for those with depression, by 57% for those using
SSRIs, by 98% for those using mood stabilizers and those with
schizophrenia, by 171% for those using antipsychotics, and by
31% for those using benzodiazepines.

orders, those with exposure to psychotropic medications, and

ses, adjusting models for an index of disease severity did not

cation results from model 2. Supplementary analysis that ad-
justed for prior use of antihypertensive medication or use of
osteoporosis medication subsequent to BMD testing did not
alter the results. The sensitivity analysis that excluded users

unchanged in significance. eTable 4 in the Supplement pre-
sents the interaction analyses, none of which were statisti-
cally significant, with the possible exception of SSRI use and
osteoporosis treatment subsequent to BMD testing for MOF,

cant interaction was seen for hip fracture or osteoporosis treat-
ment prior to BMD testing. Analyses based on FRAX probabil-
ity computed without BMD testing are presented in eTables 5
and 6 and eFigures 1 and 2 in the Supplement.
Discussion
This study adds to the existing literature on the use of psycho-
tropic medications and the risk of fracture.37 The primary find-
ing is that FRAX significantly underestimated fracture risk
among people with mental disorders and among those taking
awiderangeofpsychotropicmedications.Ourresultsarebased
on all persons referred for osteoporosis screening with DXA,
with linkage to physician diagnoses of mental disorders and a
population-based database capturing detailed information on
medication dispensed and incident fractures. Accordingly, our
results are most applicable to older individuals, especially
women,whoareconsideredtobeatriskofosteoporosis.Health
care professionals should be aware of these effects when as-
sessing osteoporosis in people with mental illness.
Although fracture stratification with the FRAX tool was
preserved among those with mental disorders and those using
psychotropic medications compared with the general popu-
lation, calibration was significantly affected. FRAX scores un-
derestimated the risk of MOF and hip fracture among per-
sons with depression and those using SSRIs, mood stabilizers,
antipsychotics, and benzodiazepines. Although age did not
affect the relative risk associated with a specific mental health
diagnosis or medication, the absolute risk would be larger
among older individuals and those with higher baseline prob-
ability of fracture.
Several meta-analyses have found an association be-
tween fractures and the use of SSRIs, benzodiazepines, and
antipsychotics.8,38-40 The mechanism of this association may
be in part due to the bone-mediated effects of these medica-
tions (median duration of use, >3 years for all medications),

 but it also may be secondary to falls.40,41 Falls are not a FRAX
input variable, which remains a plausible explanation for the
increased risk of fracture associated with some psychotropic
medications.23
Limitations
There are limitations to consider in the interpretation of these
results. The study sample consisted of people referred for DXA
testing; therefore, these results are most applicable to older
adults, predominantly female, who are considered by pri-
mary care professionals to be at risk for osteoporosis. This po-
tential selection bias may be offset by the fact the Manitoba
BoneDensityProgramisthesinglecentralizedprogramforDXA
testing in the province. A second limitation relates to the as-
certainment of mental disorders. Given the low rates of men-
tal health service use among people with mental disorders sur-
veyed in many population-based studies,42 the rates in
administrative data may underestimate the true rate in the
sample. A related issue is disease severity, which was based
on a proxy measure of the use of health services. Clinical as-
sessment of severity using standardized measures would be
preferable but was not an option in this data set. A third fac-
toristheassessmentofpsychotropicmedications,whichislim-
ited to prescriptions dispensed and raises uncertainties as to
whether an individual adhered to treatment or what the
specific indication for treatment was. The examined medica-
tions could have been used for conditions unrelated to men-
tal disorders, such as neuropathic pain or a seizure disorder.
Furthermore, certain classes, specifically other antidepres-
sants and mood stabilizers, have intraclass variability with
respect to the adverse effects of weight, which in turn
makes it difficult to interpret their effect on fracture risk.Ex-
posure was defined by an arbitrarily chosen medication pos-
session ratio of more than 0.5, given that there is no
accepted cutoff for high exposure. Nevertheless, the medi-
cation data sets used in this study still represent a distinct
advantage over previous studies, given their population
coverage and accuracy of medications, dates of prescrip-
tion, and dose recordings.
The lack of assessment of falls is an important limitation.
The menopausal status of most of the women was unknown
but was recorded during the last data year, and more than 99%
of the women (6578 of 6604) were postmenopausal. The re-
sultswerenotstratifiedbysexgiventhelowpercentageofmen
in the study. Men qualifying for DXA testing had a high preva-
lence of prior fracture, glucocorticoid use, or other secondary
causeofosteoporosis.Finally,pharmacologictreatmentforos-
teoporosis has not been shown to reduce the risk of trau-
matic fractures.
Conclusions
Diagnosed mental disorders and psychotropic medications
identify subgroups at increased risk for fractures, and where
this excess risk is not fully captured by the FRAX tool. Results
are similar for FRAX scores calculated with and without BMD
testing, and would therefore be applicable in the absence of
DXA testing. Osteoporosis and mental disorders are highly
prevalent conditions, and, as such, these findings have sub-
stantial implications for mental health care workers and pri-
mary care practitioners. Broader public health initiatives and
advocacy may be required to achieve better recognition and
management of this elevated risk of fracture given that pa-
tients with psychiatric illness may not receive optimal treat-
ment for comorbid physical health conditions.43
