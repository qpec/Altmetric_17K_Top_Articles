Associated With Cardiometabolic
Risk Factors in Adults With
Prediabetes: The PREVIEW Study
Diabetes Care 2018;41:562–569 | https://doi.org/10.2337/dc17-1057
OBJECTIVE
The aim of the present cross-sectional study was to examine the association among
physical activity (PA), sedentary time (ST), and cardiometabolic risk in adults with
prediabetes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Participants (n = 2,326; 25–70 years old, 67% female) from eight countries, with a
BMI >25 kg · m22 and impaired fasting glucose (5.6–6.9 mmol · L21) or impaired
glucose tolerance (7.8–11.0 mmol · L21 at 2 h), participated. Seven-day accelerom-
etry objectively assessed PA levels and ST.
RESULTS
Multiple linear regression revealed that moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) was nega-
tively associated with HOMA of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (standardized b = 20.078
[95% CI 20.128, 20.027]), waist circumference (WC) (b = 20.177 [20.122, 20.134]),
fasting insulin (b = 20.115 [20.158, 20.072]), 2-h glucose (b = 20.069
[20.112, 20.025]), triglycerides (b = 20.091 [20.138, 20.044]), and CRP
(b = 20.086 [20.127, 20.045]). ST was positively associated with HOMA-IR (b =
0.175 [0.114, 0.236]), WC (b = 0.215 [0.026, 0.131]), fasting insulin (b = 0.155 [0.092,
0.219]), triglycerides (b = 0.106 [0.052, 0.16]), CRP (b = 0.106 [0.39, 0.172]), systolic
blood pressure (BP) (b = 0.078 [0.026, 0.131]), and diastolic BP (b = 0.106
[0.39, 20.172]). Associations reported between total PA (counts · min21), and all
risk factors were comparable or stronger than for MVPA: HOMA-IR (b = 20.151
[20.194, 20.107]), WC (b = 20.179 [20.224, 20.134]), fasting insulin (b = 20.139
[20.183, 20.096]), 2-h glucose (b = 20.088 [20.131, 20.045]), triglycerides
(b = 20.117 [20.162, 20.071]), and CRP (b = 20.104 [20.146, 20.062]).
CONCLUSIONS
In adults with prediabetes, objectively measured PA and ST were associated with
cardiometabolic risk markers. Total PA was at least as strongly associated with
cardiometabolic risk markers as MVPA, which may imply that the accumulation of
total PA over the day is as important as achieving the intensity of MVPA.

CARDIOVASCULAR AND METABOLIC RISK
 The global prevalence of diabetes among
adults has almost quadrupled since 1980
to 422 million cases in 2014, and contin-
ued growth is expected (1). This dramatic
rise in prevalence is largely due to the in-
crease in type 2 diabetes, which accounts
for the majority of all diagnosed cases in
adults (1). Changes in lifestyle factors
such as sedentary behavior, insufficient
physical activity (PA), dietary choices,
and excess weight are important con-
tributors to the development of type 2
diabetes (2). PA plays an important role,
independent of weight, in the prevention
of type 2 diabetes through its effect on
insulin resistance (3). PA leads to the
translocation of GLUT4 transporters to
the plasma membrane, increasing glucose
uptake into skeletal muscle (4). Sedentary
time (ST) has also been associated with
insulin resistance and fasting triglyceride
levels, independent of PA and obesity (5).
ST is thought to affect carbohydrate me-
tabolism by decreasing muscle GLUT4
concentrations while also reducing lipo-
protein lipase activity and triglyceride
clearance (6,7).
Light activity is also associated with car-
diometabolic health and, together with ST,
occupies the majority of waking hours (8).
Indeed, light-intensity activity substan-
tially contributes to overall daily energy
expenditure and may also mean spending
less time in sedentary behaviors.
Many studies reporting associations
between PA, ST, and cardiometabolic risk
factors are limited by the self-reported
measures of PA and ST (9,10), which are
susceptible to reporting and recall bias.
In the limited number that have used ob-
jective measures of PA, investigations of
international samples measured concur-
rently with the same protocol are lacking
and little consistency exists with regard to
the devices, wear-time criteria, intensity
cut points, or epoch lengths used, thereby
limiting the ability to make comparisons
between these studies. Furthermore, de-
spite those with prediabetes being at the
highest risk of developing type 2 diabetes
and representing the population for which
many lifestyle interventions are targeted,
few studies have described the relation-
ship between PA and insulin resistance in
this population.
Typically,epidemiologicalresearchassess-
ing the effect of PA and ST on cardiometa-
bolic risk factors has been conducted in the
generalpopulation(8,11,12). The few stud-
ies conducted in high-risk populations
have included participants based on a risk
score questionnaire (5) or family history
of type 2 diabetes (9,13), or participants
diagnosed with diabetes and predia-
betes have been combined (14). Conse-
quently, physical characteristics and
metabolic parameters of study partici-
pants varied substantially. As a result, it
is unclear to what extent reported associ-
ationscould beinferredtoindividualswith
prediabetes.
Therefore, the purpose of this study
was to quantify the relationship between
objectively measured PA and ST with car-
diometabolic health and risk of diabetes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Participants and Setting
A detailed account of the PREVention of
diabetes through lifestyle Intervention
and population studies in Europe and
around the World (PREVIEW) project
has previously been published (15). Par-
ticipants were recruited into PREVIEW
between June 2013 and February 2015.
PREVIEW is a large multinational diabetes
prevention intervention being conducted
at eight study sites: University of Copen-
hagen (Denmark), University of Helsinki
(Finland), University of Maastricht (the
Netherlands), University of Nottingham
(U.K.),University ofNavarra (Spain), Med-
ical University of Sofia (Bulgaria), Univer-
sity of Sydney (Australia), and University
of Auckland (New Zealand).
Participants were selected through an
Internet-based prescreening tool or tele-
phone interview using the Finnish Diabe-
tes Risk Score (16). A total of 15,611
individuals were contacted for prescreen-
ing. Potential participants were sent a
written description of the trial, were given
verbal information at the study site, and
signed informed consent prior to a labo-
ratoryscreening.The laboratoryscreening
was attended by 5,472 participants and
included assessment of body mass, stat-
ure, and resting blood pressure (BP) and a
2-h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)
(17). Glucose concentrations were ana-
lyzed at each study site (HemoCue,
Angelholm, Sweden; Reflotron, Roche Di-
agnostics,Switzerland;orEML105Radiom-
eter, Copenhagen, Denmark) to identify
people with preexisting diabetes.
At the end of this process, 2,326 partici-
pants met the following inclusion criteria and
were found eligible to take part in the study:
age25–70years,BMI.25 kg/m2, andpre-
diabetes confirmed at OGTT. Prediabetes
was defined in line with World Health
Organization/International Diabetes Fed-
eration and American Diabetes Associa-
tion criteria (17) as either 1) impaired
fasting glucose, with venous plasma glu-
cose concentration of 5.6–6.9 mmol z L21,
or 2) impaired glucose tolerance, with ve-
nous plasma glucose concentration of
7.8–11.0 mmol z L21 at 2 h and fasting
plasma glucose ,7.0 mmol z L21. Partic-
ipants were free of preexisting type 2
diabetes and of any illness and/or medica-
tion with a potential effect on compliance
or the outcomes of the study.
Measurements and Procedures
Physical Activity
ParticipantsworeanActiSleep+(ActiGraph
LLC, Pensacola, FL) accelerometer at-
tached to an elastic waist belt worn over
the right midaxillary line. The ActiSleep+
was worn 24 h z day21 for seven consec-
utive days, with removal only for water-
based activities. The principal outputfrom
the ActiSleep+ is an activity count, which
represents raw accelerations that have
been rescaled and filtered. Activity counts
were collected at 100 Hz and aggregated
to 60-s epochs (18). Sleep time was
determined using a fully automated algo-
rithm developed for use in 24-h waist-
worn accelerometer protocols. The
algorithm produces estimates of a noc-
turnal sleep period that are compared
with an expert visual inspection of accel-
erometer trace (19). After the removal of
nocturnal sleep episodes, participants
were included in the analyses if they
wore the monitor for $10 h on $4 days
(18) including 1 weekend day (20). Mean
activity count during valid wear time
(counts z min21 [CPM]) has been shown
to correlate well with total activity energy
expenditure measured by the doubly la-
beled water technique (21) and was used
as an indicator of total PA volume (18,22).
Troiano cut points (18) were used to de-
termine time (min z day21) spent at differ-
ent intensity categories (sedentary ,100,
moderate ,2,020, and vigorous ,5,999
CPM). Moderate and vigorous activity
were summed to obtain moderate-to-
vigorous PA (MVPA).
Cardiometabolic Risk Factors
In all study centers, standardized proce-
dures were followed and measurements
were performed by trained personnel.
Self-administered questionnaires, accel-
erometer data, and fasting blood samples
were collected at baseline. Blood was

 drawn from the vein in the antecubital
fossa after fasting (.10 h). Blood samples
were initially stored locally at 280°C and
then transported and analyzed centrally
at the National Institution for Health and
Welfare (THL) in Helsinki, Finland, where
they were analyzed for insulin, HbA1c,
glucose, hs-CRP, total cholesterol, triglyc-
erides, HDL cholesterol, and LDL choles-
terol concentrations. Insulin resistance
was calculated using HOMA of insulin re-
sistance (HOMA-IR) with the following
equation: HOMA-IR = fasting insulin
(mU z L21) 3 fasting glucose (mmol z L21)/
22.5. HOMA-IR has been validated against
the gold standard hyperinsulinemic-
euglycemic clamp technique (23). Total
adiposity was assessed by DEXA at four
sites (Copenhagen, Nottingham, Sydney,
and Auckland), by bioelectrical impedance
at three (Helsinki, Sofia, and Navarra), and
with BOD POD (Maastricht) at one. Self-
administered questionnaires assessed
general and socioeconomic variables, in-
cluding ethnicity, educational status, and
household income.
Statistical Analysis
Descriptive statistics (mean 6 SD) were
calculated for continuous variables and
frequencies (%) for categorical variables.
Two-fifths of the participants had a miss-
ing value on at least one variable; HOMA-IR
was missing in 7.8% of all cases, while 17%
of values were missing for the accelerome-
ter values (CPM, MVPA, and ST). Multiple
imputation with a fully conditional specifi-
cation model (Markov chain Monte Carlo)
was used to impute missing values. All var-
iables were included in the imputation, and
all variables with skewed distribution were
log10- or square root–transformed prior
to imputation (24). Ten multiple imputed
data sets were generated, and pooled es-
timates were reported. Owing to their
positively skewed distribution, HDL cho-
lesterol, triglycerides hs-CRP, and waist
circumference were logarithmically trans-
formed(log10),whileHOMA-IRwassquare
root–transformed.
Separate multiple linear regression
models were performed to test the inde-
pendent association of MVPA, CPM, and
ST with cardiometabolic health markers
(HOMA-IR, fasting insulin, fasting plasma
glucose, 2-h glucose, HbA1c, waist circum-
ference, triglycerides, total cholesterol,
HDL cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol)
and CRP with adjustment for potential
confounders.
Model 1 was adjusted for age, sex,
ethnicity (Caucasian, Asian, black, Ara-
bic, Hispanic, or other), smoking (daily,
less than weekly, and no smoking), ac-
celerometer wear time, intervention
center, sleep duration, body fat%, educa-
tion level (no formal education, primary/
junior school, secondary school, secondary
vocational education, higher vocational ed-
ucation, or university education), and
household income (less than £9,360,
£9,360–12,479.99, £12,480–15,599.99,
£15,600–18,719.99, £18,720–22,879.99,
£22,880–27,559.99, £27,560–32,759.99,
£32,760–41,079.99, £41,080–53,559.99,
and £53,560 or more per year). Model
2 was additionally adjusted for ST when
MVPA was the main exposure variable or
for MVPA when ST was the main exposure
variable.
Sex, age (,45.9, 46–54.9, and .55
years), BMI, and intervention center dif-
ferences in the associations between
MVPA, ST, or CPM and each cardiometa-
bolic risk factor were tested for by adding
interaction terms to the model.
A variance inflation factor of ,4 con-
firmed that multicollinearity was not a
concern (25). Square root and log trans-
formations were directly compared
across cardiometabolic markers and re-
sults of linear regression analysis pre-
sented as standardized b-coefficients.
Data were analyzed using the Statistical
Package for the Social Sciences, version
22.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL), and a was set
to P , 0.05.
RESULTS
Table 1 displays the descriptive physi-
cal and biochemical characteristics of
the 2,326 participants (32% male, age
52.2 6 11.5 years). Waking accelerome-
ter wear time was 928.40 6 83.37 and
933.10 6 83.85 min/day for men and
women, respectively. Mean ST was
617.54 6 98.06 for men and 579.46 6
91.76 min/day for women. Mean MVPA
was 31.58 6 20.62 min/day for men and
26.18 6 17.03 min/day for women. Only
50% of participants met the recommended
guidelines of 30 min of MVPA per day (26).
Tables 2–4 show the standardized re-
gression coefficients of CPM, MVPA, and
ST with the cardiometabolic risk factors.
CPM
Table 2 shows the standardized regres-
sion coefficients of CPM with the cardio-
metabolic risk factors. After adjustment
for age, sex, ethnicity, smoking, acceler-
ometer wear time, intervention center,
sleep duration, body fat%, education
level, and household income, CPM had
significant inverse associations with
HOMA-IR,waist circumference, fasting in-
sulin, 2-h glucose, triglycerides, and
CRP and a positive association with HDL
cholesterol.
MVPA
Table 3 shows the standardized regres-
sion coefficients for MVPA with the car-
diometabolic risk factors. In model 1,
adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, smoking,
accelerometer wear time, intervention
center, sleep duration, body fat%, educa-
tion level, and household income, MVPA
was significantly and negatively associ-
ated with HOMA-IR, waist circumference,
fasting insulin, 2-h glucose, triglycerides,
and CRP and positively associated with
HDL cholesterol.
After adjustment for ST in model 2, the
association with HDL cholesterol was lost.
Associations with other biochemical fac-
tors were slightly attenuated, but all re-
mained significant.
Sedentary Time
Table 4 shows the standardized regres-
sion coefficientsfor STwiththe cardiome-
tabolic risk factors. In model 1, adjusted
for age, sex, ethnicity, smoking, acceler-
ometer wear time, intervention center,
sleep duration, body fat%, education
level, and household income, ST was pos-
itively associated with waist circumfer-
ence, systolic BP, diastolic BP, mean
arterial pressure, fasting insulin, 2-h glu-
cose, HOMA-IR, triglycerides, and CRP
and negatively associated with HDL. After
adjustment for MVPA in model 2, associ-
ations with 2-h plasma glucose were no
longer significant.
Fasting plasma glucose, total choles-
terol, and LDL cholesterol were not asso-
ciated with any of our exposure variables.
Two-way interactions indicate that as-
sociations between MVPA and fasting in-
sulin were greater in the older age-group
(Table 3). We did not observe any signif-
icant sex, center, or BMI interactions be-
tween measures of PA or ST and any
cardiometabolic risk factors.
CONCLUSIONS
This study investigated the associations
between objectively measured PA and
ST and metabolic variables in a worldwide
sample of overweight and obese adults

PA and Cardiometabolic Risk in Prediabetes
Diabetes Care Volume 41, March 2018
 (BMI .25 kg/m2) with prediabetes con-
firmed through an OGTT (27). To our
knowledge, this is the first international
investigation of associations between ob-
jectively measured PA and ST with cardi-
ometabolic risk factors in a population
that exclusively meet the criteria for
prediabetes (impaired fasting glucose
[5.6–6.9 mmol z L21] or impaired glucose
tolerance [7.8–11 mmol z L21]). Previous
studies conducted in high-risk popula-
tions have included participants based
on a risk score questionnaire (5) or family
history of type 2 diabetes (9,13), or par-
ticipants with diabetes and prediabetes
have been combined (14). Consequently,
physical characteristics and metabolic
parameters reported in these studies
varied substantially from those in the
current study. In our population of partic-
ipants with prediabetes, MVPA was nega-
tively associated with HOMA-IR, waist
circumference, fasting insulin, 2-h glucose,
triglycerides, and CRP after accounting for
potential confounders (sleep duration and
ST).Ourstudyalsodemonstratedthattotal
PA volume (CPM) was at least as strongly
associated with the aforementioned risk
factors as was MVPA.
Before ST was controlled for in model 2,
totalPAvolume alsoaccounted forgreater
variance in cardiometabolic risk factors
than did MVPA. Hence, it appears that in
this population, although both are signifi-
cant, the accumulation of total PA over a
day is a stronger indicator of insulin resis-
tanceandsomerelatedcardiometabolicrisk
factors than MVPA.
Previous studies in populations with a
family history of diabetes and newly di-
agnosed diabetes have shown that total
energy expenditure spent on PA (14),
CPM (13), and MVPA (9) were negatively
associated with waist circumference,
fasting serum triglycerides, systolic BP,
fasting plasma glucose, fasting plasma in-
sulin, HOMA-IR, and a clustered meta-
bolic risk score. In agreement with our
findings, Ekelund, Griffin, and Wareham
(13) reported that total counts z day21
was more strongly associated with clus-
tered risk and individual cardiometabolic
risk factorsthan wasMVPA.Inthegeneral
population, Balkau et al. (28) reported as-
sociations between MVPA and total PA
with insulin resistance using the gold
standard clamp technique for determin-
ing insulin sensitivity. However, after ad-
justment for total PA, associations with
MVPA were lost (28). These findings, in

 keeping with the current study, would
support the hypothesis that the accumu-
lation of total PA volume accounts for
greater variance in insulin resistance and
some related cardiometabolic risk factors
than does MVPA.
The current study also demonstrated
that after confounders were controlled
for, ST was positively associated with
waist circumference, systolic BP, diastolic
BP, fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, triglycer-
ides, CRP, and HDL cholesterol indepen-
dent of time spent in MVPA.
In agreement with our findings, Henson
et al. (5) reported positive associations
between ST, 2-h plasma glucose, tri-
glycerides, and HDL cholesterol, indepen-
dent of total PA, in a population at risk
for type 2 diabetes (5). Similarly, positive
associations between ST, waist circumfer-
ence, insulin, HOMA-IR, and HDL choles-
terol were reported in an older group
with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes
(22). There is a lack of consensus on the
role of ST in pathology of cardiometabolic
risk factors. Some authors have reported
that once total energy expenditure is
taken into account, the associations be-
tween ST and cardiometabolic health
are lost. These findings suggest that ST
reduces total energy expenditure by
displacing other activities that are more
energy costly (28,29). Other investigators
have found that the mechanism linking
ST to glucose metabolism and metabolic
health differ from those of PA and may be
related to static posture and unloading
of large skeletal muscle groups when
seated (7,30). ST is thought to affect glu-
cose homeostasis and lipid metabolism
by reducing muscle GLUT4 content and
insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (6)
while also reducing lipoprotein lipase ac-
tivity, leading to impaired triglyceride and
HDL cholesterol metabolism (7).
Further, light activity is associated with
marked improvements in cardiometa-
bolic health (8), while interventions have
shown that replacing ST with postural
changes such as standing or light ambu-
latory activity can improve glycemic con-
trol to a greater extent than structured
exercise of the same energy cost (31). In
the present analysis, ST was associated
with HDL cholesterol; however, associa-
tions between MVPA and HDL choles-
terol were lost after controlling for ST.
Similarly, ST was positively associated
with systolic and diastolic BP indepen-
dent of MVPA, while no association was
found between CPM or MVPA with either
BP variable. Associations of PA and ST
with BP variables reported by observa-
tional studies have been inconsistent
(8,12,14). However, experimental studies
in overweight/obese populations have
suggested that a reduction of ST and the
interruption of prolonged sedentary

PA and Cardiometabolic Risk in Prediabetes
Diabetes Care Volume 41, March 2018
 bouts with light or moderate activity are
associated with improved systolic and di-
astolic BP (32).
While PA guidelines continue to focus
on participation in MVPA (26), our data
demonstrated that in a population with
prediabetes, total volume of PA was as
strongly associated with cardiometabolic
health as was MVPA. The implications of
this finding may be important consider-
ing the levels of PA in this population.
Light activity may be more readily adop-
ted by individuals with prediabetes, par-
ticularly if they are physically inactive,
overweight/obese, or reluctant to engage
in structured exercise (31).
The lackof associations observed for all
exposure variables with fasting glucose is
consistent with previous research (5,8).
This finding reflects the fact that PA pre-
dominantly affects peripheral insulin sen-
sitivity, which is responsible for lowering
blood glucose levels after an OGTT, when
most of the glucose is taken up by skeletal
muscle. Conversely, in a fasted state, pe-
ripheral insulin sensitivity has little effect
on plasma glucose (33).
The strengths of this study are the im-
plementation of a 24-h accelerometer
wear-time protocol that resulted in a
greater mean waking wear time (15.5 h)
than seen in many studies of a similar
nature (5,18,22). Longer monitoring dura-
tion provides greater reliability of average
activity estimates. This approach also al-
lowed an objective assessment of sleep
time using an algorithm to detect sleep
onset and wake time from a 24-h waist-
worn accelerometer trace (19). This al-
lowed the study team to control for the
confounding effects of sleep on cardio-
metabolic risk factors (34).
Type 2 diabetes is high on public health
agendas, with attention on the preven-
tion or delay of diabetes onset and the
management of cardiometabolic risk fac-
tors (35,36). National and international
guidelines focus on, first, identifying
high-risk individuals and, second, control-
ling modifiable risk factors such as body
weight, diet, ST, and PA through targeted
interventions (37,38). This study provides
new evidence of associations of PA and
ST with cardiometabolic markers in a
population to whom the results are
most applicable.
Whilethisstudyhasnumerousstrengths,
it is also important to acknowledge its lim-
itations. First, the cross-sectional design
does not allow insight into the direction of
causality between each exposure variable
and markers of cardiometabolic health,
and although we controlled for many po-
tential confounding factors, we did not
account for dietary intake or alcohol con-
sumption, which may have influenced
our results. Second, although accelerome-
ters offer more robust assessments of PA
than self-report (39), they are not without
limitation. Hip-worn accelerometers cap-
ture most movement during locomotion
but cannot account for upper-body
movement, movement that occurs during
activities such as cycling or weight lifting
(40), ordistinguishbetweenlight-intensity
activities such as sitting and standing.
Furthermore, the accelerometer is re-
moved during water-based activities
and contact sports. Therefore, PA may
be underestimated. Given the fixed na-
ture of accelerometer-derived variables
(sleep, light activity, ST, and MVPA) as
proportions of 24 hours, time spent in
behaviors within the day are inherently
collinear; every increase in time spent in
one behavior unavoidably causes a de-
crease in the time spent in one or a com-
bination of the other behaviors. Thus, it is
not possible to include all subcompo-
nents of the day (sleep, ST, light activity,
and MVPA) in a regression model without
violating collinearity assumptions. Conse-
quently, in the current study it is not
possible to say with certainty that the
positive associations observed between
cardiometabolic risk factors and ST are
truly independent and not, in fact, nega-
tive associations with light activity. Fi-
nally, participants in this study were
volunteers for a lifestyle intervention
from the eight study sites worldwide, ap-
proximately 50% of whom were between
55 and 70 years of age. While this may
limit the applicability of the current find-
ings to this older age range, it is this group
who is at greater risk of type 2 diabetes
and is perhaps more likely to participate
in such interventions given their greater
availability of time compared with those
still employed.
In conclusion, this study provides new
evidence that in a large diverse popula-
tion of adults with prediabetes, objective
measuresofPAand STare associatedwith

more, associations with total PA volume are
at least as strong as with MVPA. Taken to-
gether, these findings suggest that replac-
ing ST with light activity may provide a
practical approach to improve cardiometa-
bolic health in a population with low en-
gagement in MVPA.
