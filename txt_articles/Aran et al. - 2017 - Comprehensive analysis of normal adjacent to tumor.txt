Histologically normal tissue adjacent to the tumor (NAT) is commonly used as a control in
cancer studies. However, little is known about the transcriptomic profile of NAT, how it is
influenced by the tumor, and how the profile compares with non-tumor-bearing tissues. Here,
we integrate data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression project and The Cancer Genome
Atlas to comprehensively analyze the transcriptomes of healthy, NAT, and tumor tissues in
6506 samples across eight tissues and corresponding tumor types. Our analysis shows that
NAT presents a unique intermediate state between healthy and tumor. Differential gene
expression and protein–protein interaction analyses reveal altered pathways shared among
NATs across tissue types. We characterize a set of 18 genes that are specifically activated in
NATs. By applying pathway and tissue composition analyses, we suggest a pan-cancer
mechanism of pro-inflammatory signals from the tumor stimulates an inflammatory response
in the adjacent endothelium.

 T
he regions immediately surrounding tumors have many
morphologic and phenotypic distinctions from non-
tumor-bearing healthy tissue, including pH levels1, allelic
imbalance and telomere length2, stromal behavior3, and tran-
scriptomic and epigenetic aberrations4. These substantial phe-
notypic and genetic changes are apparent up to 1 cm from the
margins of the tumor. Therefore, histologically normal samples
dissected adjacent to the tumor but beyond the observed aber-
rations (hereby referred to as NAT, normal adjacent to tumor),
are frequently designated as healthy control samples for cancer
studies under the assumption that histological normalcy implies
biological normalcy. This approach has many advantages, such as
allowing a comparison between samples from the same indivi-
dual, often from a single larger tissue specimen, thus reducing
individual-specific and anatomical site-specific effects. However,
little is known about NAT tissue on the molecular level and
whether it is truly “normal”. Perhaps, this is due to shortage of
samples from non-diseased individuals, which are often difficult
to obtain. Indeed, the limited number of studies that have char-
acterized the NAT tissue relative to healthy tissues have focused
on breast tissue, where healthy marginal tissue samples can be
readily obtained from reduction mammoplasty and prophylactic
mastectomy5–7.
The study of NAT tissue has been debated since Slaughter
et al.8 first described the “field cancerization” theory, suggesting a
cumulative process of carcinogenesis in which genetic alterations
are acquired step-wise, leaving the NAT tissue in an intermediate,
pre-neoplastic state composed of morphologically normal but
molecularly altered cells. Recent studies on breast NAT suggested
that the microenvironment surrounding the tumor, not the epi-
thelial cells, is essential for understanding recurrence and in
developing surgical strategies9. Moreover, NAT tissue gene
expression is enriched for stromal pathways10, prominently
consistent with wound response pathways11. Thorough evalua-
tions have suggested that NAT tissue undergoes extracellular
matrix remodeling, wound healing-like processes, fibrosis, and an
epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition
(EMT)3.
Other
studies
focusing on prostate12, liver13, and colon14 have broadened the
scope of NAT characterization; however, no multi-tissue multi-
cancer evaluation has been performed to date, and a full char-
acterization of NAT tissue is lacking.
The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) program15 is a
multicenter effort to generate genomic and transcriptomic pro-
filing data for >50 tissue sites from hundreds of autopsies. The
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)16 is another multicenter effort to
produce molecular profiling data from thousands of cancer

samples across bladder, breast, colon, liver, lung, prostate, thyroid, and uterus tissues, and matched with corresponding tumor types 428 normal adjacent
tumor (NAT) and 4500 tumor samples from TCGA. We performed identical processing of all samples using the protocol presented in Rahman et al.23, and
validated that the data are coherent. We then utilized several techniques to characterize the differences between healthy tissues, NAT, and tumor tissues

 patients across >30 cancer types. In ~10% of these samples, the
TCGA program also generated molecular profiling data of NAT
tissues. According to TCGA protocols, NAT samples must be
collected >2 cm from the tumor margin and/or must not contain
tumor by histopathologic review17–22. By combining the data
from GTEx and TCGA, we broaden the scope of NAT char-
acterization from studies focusing on single tissue types to a more
systematic analysis of eight distinct tissues and their corre-
sponding tumors (together referred to as tissue types), repre-
senting the most common solid malignancies. Although there are
many differences between tissue types, we focused this study on
the shared elements of NAT across tissue types, which have not
been evaluated to date. This expanded analysis allowed us to
interrogate general mechanisms by which tumors interact with its
surrounding tissue. We performed a comprehensive analysis of
transcriptomic profiles from healthy tissue, NAT, and tumor,
including
dimensionality
reduction,
differential
expression,
protein–protein interactions (PPI), gene-set enrichment, and
tissue composition analyses to provide a coherent picture of NAT
tissue characteristics. Our analyses showed that the NAT tissue is
distinct from both healthy tissue and tumor and represents an
intermediate state between them. We uncovered NAT-specific
characteristics, namely activation of pro-inflammatory immedi-
ate-early response genes concordant with endothelial cell stimu-
lation. We suggest that the induction of this NAT-specific
signature
is
orchestrated
by
the
tumor,
spreading
pro-
inflammatory signals to its surroundings. Our cross-tissue ana-
lysis allowed us to detect pan-cancer characteristics, and we
suggest that stromal changes in NAT represent an emerging
hallmark of cancer that may be essential for tumorigenesis and/or
tumor progression.
Results
Integrative analysis of TCGA and GTEx RNA-seq data. An
identical analysis pipeline is required to allow rigorous compar-
ison of the transcriptomic profiles from TCGA and GTEx
(Fig. 1a). To this end, we obtained raw RNA-seq reads of GTEx
samples and applied the exact pipeline used for the production of
raw counts of mapped reads previously described23. We com-
bined these with TCGA raw count data analyzed using the same
pipeline and compiled a transcriptomic dataset comprising of
1558 healthy normal samples, 428 NAT samples, and 4500 pri-
mary tumor samples across eight tissue types (Table 1). Note that
although GTEx tissue donors cannot be referred to as “healthy” as
they comprise a broad range of non-cancer disease processes,
which led to death24, we designate them as such in this study to
connote that none of the donors were diagnosed with cancer. The
collective cancer patients were significantly older than the
patients contributing the healthy samples, 12.2 years on average,
in most tissues. The only exception is thyroid, where the cancer
patients tended to be younger than those individuals from which
the healthy samples were obtained.
To concordantly analyze expression profiles from TCGA and
GTEx, we first verified comparability between the two datasets. To
do so, we started by analyzing fragments per kilobase of transcript
per million (FPKM) values and correlating median expression
profiles of the eight healthy tissue types with all NAT samples.
Altogether, 94.6% of the NAT samples were correctly correlated
with the corresponding healthy tissue (Fig. 1b), supporting general
comparability between the datasets. Another way to test for
differential batch effects is by comparing the expression and
variation of housekeeping genes. We correlated the median
expression levels of housekeeping genes25 across all non-tumor
samples and found a strikingly high degree of agreement between
the datasets (Pearson R = 0.973, p-value < 1 × 10−20) (Fig. 1c;
Supplementary Fig. 1). Moreover, we observed a high level of
agreement when comparing the variation of expression levels
within the dataset (Spearman R = 0.902, p-value < 1 × 10−20)
(Supplementary Fig. 1). Although we admit a perfect study would
involve simultaneously obtained freshly collected normal and
cancer samples from the same individuals, these findings
demonstrate that GTEx and TCGA can be analyzed jointly.
NAT tissue is distinct from both healthy and tumor tissues. We
performed dimensionality reduction for each tissue type’s tran-
scriptome. In these analyses, we used counts per million (CPM)
values normalized with the upper quartile normalization method,
excluding genes with low read abundance due to the pronounced
differences in library sizes between TCGA and GTEx (Supple-
mentary Fig. 2). Strikingly, the same trend was observed in all
tissue types: the three conditions were clearly distinguished, with
NAT samples found between tumor and healthy samples (Fig. 2a;
Supplementary Fig. 3). Thus, across disparate tissue contexts,
NAT is a distinct tissue type that reproducibly segregates between
healthy and tumor, as predicted by the field cancerization theory,
and may not be appropriately categorized as “normal”.
The disparities between the source datasets for healthy and
NAT tissues above represent a major potential weakness of this
analysis. Thus, to validate our findings we searched public data
repositories for smaller independent studies that collected
samples from all three conditions jointly. Our search yielded
four microarray cohorts with sufficient sample sizes in colon14,
liver13, breast26, and prostate27. Using comparison methodology
similar to that described above, healthy, NAT, and tumor tissues
cleanly segregated as seen in the initial comparisons in the colon,
liver, and breast cohorts (Supplementary Fig. 4); a trend towards
this pattern of segregation was also observed in the prostate
cohort (Supplementary Fig. 5). Interestingly, NAT segregated into
a transcriptional state intermediate between healthy and normal
in the colon, liver, and prostate cohorts; however, NAT from the

 independent breast cohort did not, which could be explained by
the differences in array designs between healthy and NAT/tumor.
Another concern is the imbalanced group sizes; however, a
reduced analysis with an equal number of samples per group
reiterated our findings that NAT displays an intermediate
expression state between healthy and tumor (Supplementary
Fig. 6). Finally, an independent reanalysis of the TCGA and GTEx
samples using the Toil pipeline28 reaffirmed our findings as well,
confirming the uniqueness of NAT is not a result of improper
analysis (Supplementary Fig. 7).

 The dimensionality reduction analyses suggest that there are
differences between tissue types, such that the expression profiles
of NAT are closer to the tumor cluster in some tissues and closer
to the healthy tissue cluster in others. To better quantify this
phenomenon, we employed a deconvolution pipeline29, to
calculate a “normal:tumor” fraction for all samples. Our analysis
revealed substantial differences among NATs from different
tissue types (Fig. 2b). Expression profiles of NAT from breast,
colon, liver, lung, and uterine tumors—all malignancies that tend
to produce tumors with grossly and histologically well-defined
borders—cluster distinctly from those of both normal and tumor.
On the other hand, prostate NAT samples—a tumor that
seamlessly infiltrates surrounding “normal” tissue, often without
forming discrete tumor-normal boundaries—is highly similar to a
portion of the tumor profile, suggesting perhaps microscopic
contamination of NAT samples with tumor and tumor samples

 with NAT. This same phenomenon may also be seen in certain—
but not all—types of thyroid cancer, which could possibly explain
the intermediate (partly overlapping, partly distinct) nature of
this dataset as well.
In colon, we observed two healthy clusters (Fig. 2a). Deeper
analysis revealed that these clusters are from different sections of
the colon, sigmoid, and transverse, and suggested that the closer
resemblance of NAT to the tumor (Fig. 2b) is due to
heterogeneity in the GTEx dataset. Indeed, subsequent analyses
bifurcated
the
healthy-NAT
relationship
by
anatomic
site
(Supplementary Fig. 8), with NAT from the sigmoid colon more
closely resembling the tumor, whereas NAT from the transverse
colon more closely resembles healthy tissue.
Shared gene signatures differ NAT from healthy tissue. To
further explore the details that define this divergence between
healthy tissue and NAT, we performed differential expression
analyses across tissue types. To remove possible confounding
differences in sample preparation and batch effects that may occur
because of the different data sources, we used stringent removal of
unwanted variation30, diminishing the variations between datasets
(Supplementary Fig. 9). Yet, we identified on average 440 upre-
gulated and 554 downregulated differentially expressed genes
(DEGs) in NAT relative to healthy tissues across all tissue types
(Supplementary Data 1; Supplementary Table 1). Remarkably, we
found widespread similarities in upregulated and downregulated
DEGs across tissue types (Fig. 3a). We identified 98 genes that are
upregulated in at least four tissue types (80-fold more than
expected by random, Poisson approximation p-value < 1 × 10−20),
and 164 genes as downregulated (47-fold, Poisson approximation
p-value < 1 × 10−20) (Supplementary Data 2). Overall, 61.2% of the
upregulated genes and 73.2% of the downregulated genes showed
a tendency for upregulation or downregulation across all tissue
types (Fig. 3b; Supplementary Figs. 10 and 11). PPI analysis
revealed a remarkably significant enrichment of known interac-
tions among those genes (STRING PPI enrichment p-value < 1 ×
10−20) (Fig. 3c). Four strongly connected components shared
across tissue types were clearly observed: a ribosomal biogenesis
component (cluster 1) and several genes involved in oxidative
metabolism (cluster 4) indicating high transcriptional activity in
the NAT compared with healthy tissue; an immune component
(cluster 2), enriched for antigen-processing genes, suggesting
increased activation of the immune response; and a component
enriched for immediate-early genes (cluster 3), associated with a
wide variety of cellular stimuli and known to be widely induced
during stress responses31. Interestingly, no interactions or path-
way enrichment were observed in the 164-shared downregulated
DEGs in NAT (Supplementary Fig. 12), emphasizing the
uniqueness of the shared upregulated genes.
To gain further insight into the global patterns that distinguish
between healthy tissue and NAT, we performed a gene-set
enrichment analysis (GSEA) using the 50 hallmark gene sets32.
Altogether, 41% of all comparisons between healthy tissue and
NAT were significantly perturbed (GSEA nominal p-value false
rate discovery (FDR) < 1%) (Fig. 3d; Supplementary Data 3).
Examining the trends of divergence across tissue types revealed
robust enrichment of inflammatory response-related gene sets
upregulated in NAT, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α
signaling, interferon response, and allograft rejection. Interest-
ingly, several cancer-related signatures were also enriched in
NAT, such as KRAS signaling, p53 pathway, hypoxia, and
apoptosis. On the other extreme, cellular differentiation and
metabolic pathways, such as myogenesis, adipogenesis, and
oxidative
phosphorylation,
respectively,
were
significantly
enriched in most healthy tissues.
Characterizing a general gene expression profile for NAT. We
further computed differential expression patterns between NAT
and tumor samples (Supplementary Data 4) and divided all DEGs
between healthy, NAT, and tumors into nine models of expres-
sion change: upregulation/downregulation/stable between healthy
and NAT (A:H—Adjacent:Healthy) and between NAT and tumor
(T:A—Tumor:Adjacent) (Fig. 4a). Analyzing the aforementioned
hallmark sets we found that 55.8% of the comparisons between
NAT and tumors showed significant differentiation (FDR < 1%),
and 30.5% were significant in both NAT vs. healthy and NAT vs.
tumor (NAT-specific or gradient models) (Supplementary Fig. 13;
Supplementary Data 3). In general, cancer-related gene sets, such
as MYC and E2F targets and G2M, showed a “normal-like”
tendency in NAT; normal cellular differentiation pathways, such
as adipogenesis and myogenesis, showed a “gradient” tendency;
and inflammatory-related pathways showed a “tumor-like” ten-
dency (Fig. 4b). One gene set, the TNF-α signaling pathway,
strikingly presented a “NAT-specific” activation in seven of the
examined tissues.
We next analyzed individual differentially expressed genes.
Remarkably, of the nine models described above, only NAT-
specific upregulation or downregulation models were enriched
compared with a null hypothesis (Fig. 4c; Supplementary Table 2).
On average across tissue types, we identified 82 genes that were
upregulated compared with both healthy tissue and tumor
(TASA, tumor-adjacent specific activation), 3.8-fold more than
expected by the upregulated in A:H and downregulated in T:A in
each tissue type. This result suggests that NAT tissue represents
not just a gradient between tumor and healthy tissue or
contamination resulted by infiltrating tumor cells, but is instead
a distinct tissue phenotype. Examining the four independent
microarray cohorts strongly validated the NAT-specific activation
of the identified TASA genes (Fig. 4d; Supplementary Figs. 14–
17). Gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed a strong enrichment of
extracellular matrix (ECM)-associated genes within TASA genes
in seven out of eight tissue types (Supplementary Fig. 18), in
accordance with previous findings of ECM enrichment in the
tissue surrounding the tumors11.
Fig. 3 Upregulated genes in NAT compared with healthy. a Overall, 2451 genes were upregulated in NAT compared with healthy across all tissue types. Of
those, 660 were found in more than one tissue site, 223 in more than two (x-fold more than expected by random) and 98 in more than three (x-fold). The
chord diagram shows the vast amount of shared genes among all tissue types. b Boxplot of the expression levels of ATP5E, an example of a gene that is

of 180 edges are found between 57 of the genes (other genes not shown). Only 30 are expected by chance (Poisson approximation p-value < 1 × 10−20).
Thickness of edges indicates confidence. We observed four clusters with three or more genes cluster 1: cell division; cluster 2: immune response; cluster 3:
cellular stimuli; cluster 4: ATP. d Gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of the hallmark gene sets using NAT vs. healthy differential expression. NES are

On the other hand, the NAT tissue tends to not express normal development pathways such as myogenesis and adipogenesis (blue)

 Prominent TASA genes include EGR1/2 and FOS/FOSB
(Fig. 5a). Previous studies have shown downregulation of the
mRNA of these genes in different cancer types compared to
NAT33, 34. A study in pancreatic cancer showed higher levels of c-
FOS protein in NAT compared with the pancreatic tumors35.
Importantly, our results suggest that these genes are not, in fact,
downregulated in the tumor itself but rather they are specifically
activated in NAT, in contrast to previous studies. Altogether, we
identified 18 TASA genes shared by at least three tissues
(Supplementary Figs. 19 and 20). Strikingly, 12 of these genes
comprised a PPI network (PPI enrichment p-value < 1 × 10−20)
(Fig. 5b). Co-expression analysis revealed tight co-expression
across tissue types between most of the TASA genes (Fig. 5c).
Upstream regulators of the NAT-specific gene signatures.
Intriguingly, TASA genes are highly enriched with immediate-
early response genes (seven genes), a gene family that is rapidly
and transiently upregulated following external stimuli such as
growth factors, hormones, or stress31. Thus, we explored whether
the tumor itself may be the source of these external stimuli.
According to this hypothesis, the TASA signature should decrease
as a function of the distance from the tumor. To this end, we
analyzed a unique dataset, which examined the transcriptomes of
multiple regions surrounding breast tumors36. In 10 of 11
patients, a TASA score, calculated using single-sample gene-set
enrichment analysis (ssGSEA)37 for the 18-shared TASA genes,
was enriched in the adjacent regions, providing a validation that
this score does indeed identify NAT (Wilcoxon rank test p-value
= 0.002). Remarkably, when applied to this spatial dataset, the
TASA score remained elevated compared with the tumor even 4
cm from the tumor, suggesting that primary tumors can exert
influence over a substantial distance (Fig. 5d). In four of six
patients with multiple samples, we observed a modest decrease 4
cm from the tumor. Although the sample number is small, this
tendency for decrease of TASA score as a function of distance
might suggest a gradient effect, which remains to be examined in
more samples and more distant regions.
The long distance activation of the TASA signature in NAT
suggested a systemic effect. To test whether the TASA signature is

Fig. 4 NAT expression compared with healthy and tumor. a Genes and gene sets expression profiles were divided to nine expression models: each
gene/gene set can be upregulated (U), downregulated (D) or not differentially expressed (stable, S) in NAT vs. healthy and tumor vs. NAT. Expression
models suggest a NAT-specific activation or repression (UD/DU models), an intermediate state between normal and tumor (UU/DD), resembling healthy
(SU/SD) or resembling tumor (US/UD). The null model (SS) is not presented. b Normalized gene-set enrichment score (NES) of hallmark gene sets in
NAT compared with healthy (x axis) and compared with the tumor (y axis). Non-significant NES values (FDR < 1%) were nullified. Gene sets were colored
according to the expression models in (a) if they fit the expression model in the majority of tissue sites. NES are positive if enrichmed in NAT. Cancer-
related pathways (bottom), correspond to the SD model; inflammatory-related pathways (right), correspond to the US model; normal development gene
sets (top-left), correspond to the DD model; the TNF-α signaling pathway has a NAT-specific UD activation model. c Average fold change of the number of

adjacent, and tumor samples. Top: heatmap of gene expression in colon (GSE44076), where 106 of 119 UD genes are found. In 92 of the genes, the

four categories: higher average in NAT compared with both healthy and tumor (UD); lower average in NAT (DU); average in NAT lower than healthy but
higher than tumor (DD); higher average in NAT than healthy but lower than tumor (UU). In all four cohorts, the UD model was highly enriched compared
to expected (colon: 86.8% (expected–17.7%); liver: 79.2% (27%); breast: 69% (34.1%); Prostate: 48.4% (18.8%))

 elevated away from the tumor, we utilized a panel of human
breast cancer patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse models38,
and measured the relative protein expression level of FosB, a
prominent TASA gene, whose expression is highly correlated with
most of the TASA signature. In two out of the three PDXs, FosB
was markedly elevated in NAT compared with both the tumor
and non-tumor mammary gland from naive mice. Moreover, this
elevation was further observed in the contralateral non-tumor
mammary gland (NCT) (Fig. 5e). Although the close proximity
effect observed in NAT can be explained by proximal stress
response, it cannot explain the effect observed in NCT. In
addition, PDX models do not appear to undergo a de novo tumor
evolutionary process and are also immunocompromised38, thus
rejecting the field effect hypothesis and immune response-related
explanations. Therefore, a more appropriate explanation suggests
that the distance-driven effect is intermediated by putative signals

Fig. 5 Shared tumor-adjacent normal (NAT)-specific genes. a Boxplot of the expression levels of EGR1 and FOSB, examples of gene that are upregulated in
NAT compared with healthy and downregulated in tumors in most tissue types. b STRING analysis of protein–protein interactions (PPI) of 18 genes
specifically activated in NAT in at least three tissue types. Overall, 27 edges are found between 12 of the genes. Only 2 are expected by chance (PPI
enrichment p-value < 1 × 10−20). Thickness of edges indicates confidence. c Co-expression analysis of the 18-shared TASA genes in NAT samples. Same as
in the PPI analysis, we observe strong co-expression of 12 of the genes, but in addition, we observe that more associations between genes on top of the PPI
analysis. d TASA scores (ssGSEA of 18-shared TASA genes) in 11 breast tumors patients and in the adjacent tissue, up to 4 cm from the tumor boundaries
(E-TABM-276 study). In each patient, scores are aligned relative to the tumor. In 10 of 11 patients, an increase in TASA score was observed outside of the
tumor. The TASA score increases immediately outside the tumor (1 cm) and is maintained across the adjacent tissue. In 4 of the 6 patients with multiple
expression profiles, we observed a small decrease in TASA score in 4 cm compared to 1 or 2 cm, possibly suggesting a modest gradient effect as a function
of the distance from the tumor. e Top: western blot analysis of FosB protein levels in tumor, NAT and contralateral non-tumor (NCT) mammary gland of
three human breast cancer patient-derived xenografts (HCI-002, HCI-009, and HCI-010). In addition, 3 naive mouse mammary glands are shown as
reference. Bottom: FosB levels normalized to actin levels. Blue = HCI-002, red = HCI-009, and green = HCI-010. In two of the PDXs (HCI-002 and HCI-
009), we observed a marked elevation of FosB levels in both the NAT and NCT compared with the samples from the tumor and non-tumor from naive mice

 secreted by the tumor, which may exercise influence far away
from tumor margins.
We therefore examined possible growth factors and upstream
regulators that can be secreted by the tumor and activate this
signature. Twelve of the TASA genes (66.7%) were upregulated in
response to TNF-α, as suggested by pathway analysis, but other
cytokines, growth factors, and chemical compounds have also
been shown to activate this network (Supplementary Fig. 21;
Supplementary
Data
5).
According
to
a
literature-curated
database39, TNF was suggested as an upstream regulator for
genes specifically activated in NAT as well as in the non-shared
genes in six of the eight tissues (Supplementary Table 3). Other
attractive candidates are platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-
BB, which has a significant role in blood vessel formation, and
leukotriene D, a lipid-based inflammatory mediator that increases
vascular permeability.
We also attempted to identify putative regulators of the TASA
signature empirically. Thus, we correlated the TASA scores in
415-matched NAT and tumor samples across tissue types, sorted
by the correlation coefficient, and investigated the highly ranked

 genes (Supplementary Data 6). Among the top ranked genes
across tumor types, we detected several potential regulators for
the TASA signature, including SERPINE1 and IL6, which are
known pro-angiogenic factors40. HB-EGF, Heparin-binding EGF-
like growth factor, was found in the top 1% of half of the tumor
types. This protein has a significant role in the development of
malignant phenotypes by contributing to metastasis and invasion
by promoting EMT and angiogenesis41. Our data here suggest it
is also involved in reshaping the adjacent tissue, possibly further
enabling tumor progression.
NAT cellular composition. We previously had shown that cel-
lular composition has a profound effect on the construction of
co-expression networks42. Previous studies have shown induction
of these genes in endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and other stromal
cells43–45, thus we hypothesized that TASA signatures are speci-
fically activated in tissue stroma. Using our recently developed
method xCell46, which employs a compendium of gene signatures
with a removal of dependencies between closely related cell types,
we estimated the enrichment of 30 immune and stromal cell types
that reside in tumors and their adjacent tissues (Supplementary
Data 7).
The analysis revealed major differences in the abundance of
many cell types not just between the tissue types, but also between
healthy, NAT and tumors (Supplementary Figs. 22 and 23).
Interestingly, a t-SNE plot of all samples based on the cell types
profiles revealed that tumors across tissue types cluster together
(excluding liver). In contrast, non-tumor samples tend to cluster
according to the tissue type, such that there is a cluster for each
tissue type that includes both the healthy and the NAT samples
(Supplementary Fig. 24). Thus, while the cellular composition of
normal tissues is stable, irrespective of its proximity to a tumor,
the microenvironment inside the tumor is strongly perturbed
from its tissue of origin and has similar tendencies across tumor
types.
Across tissue types we observed several cell types with a
tendency to differentiate NAT from healthy or tumors (Fig. 6a).
Dendritic cells are highly enriched in NAT compared with
healthy tissues across all tissue types, but are less divergent
between NAT and tumors. Cell types that are classically recruited
in inflammatory response, including memory CD4+ T-cells, NK
cells, and basophils, tended to be enriched in NAT compared to
healthy, congruent with our previous findings of increased
expression of inflammatory markers in NAT compared to
healthy tissue (Supplementary Figs. 22 and 23). On the other
hand, endothelial cells showed a tendency to be depleted in NAT
compared to healthy tissue, but compared to tumor show an even
stronger tendency to be enriched. Interestingly, previous studies
have suggested that NAT tissue is enriched with endothelial
cells10; however, our analysis suggests that they are not actually
enriched in NAT but are rather strongly depleted in the tumor
itself, with NAT representing an intermediate state (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 22). In summary, our analysis suggests that inflamma-
tion, a cancer hallmark, is also strongly present in the adjacent
tissue, whereas endothelial cells are somewhat less prevalent in
NAT compared with the healthy and even less well-represented in
the tumor in a gradient-like fashion.
We next calculated a TASA score, based on the 18-shared
TASA genes, and found that it is highly enriched in NAT in most
tissue types, with relatively low variation between NAT samples
(Fig.
6b).
This
enrichment
was
further
validated
in
the
independent
microarray
datasets
(Supplementary
Fig.
25).
In colon, the TASA score did not differ between healthy and
NAT in our TCGA-GTEx dataset, but did differ in the
independent dataset, probably attributed again to the aggregation
of divergent profiles from the sigmoid and transverse sections
(Supplementary Fig. 26). Correlating TASA scores with cell type
scores revealed that it is robustly associated primarily with
endothelial cells, but also with mesenchymal stem cells (MSC),
adipocytes, monocytes, and mast cells (Fig. 6b; Supplementary
Fig. 27). In tumors, but less so in NAT and not at all in healthy,
the TASA signature also strongly correlated with activated
macrophages, which are a primary source of TNF-α47. This
result might be related to our suggestion above that the tumor is
the source of the factors that induce the TASA signature in NAT.
We also correlated TASA scores with ssGSEA scores of hallmark
gene sets (Supplementary Fig. 28). Here, we observed high
concordance between TASA and hallmark gene sets across tissue
types, regardless of tissue condition, revealing a high prevalence
of gene sets representing hypoxia, TNF-α and TGF-β signaling,
apoptosis, EMT, and angiogenesis (Fig. 6b), in accordance with
our previous findings of enrichment of these pathways in NAT.
To
test
our
gene
expression-based
association
between
endothelial cells and the TASA score, we collected excision
specimens from three human breast tumors with clear adjacent
regions. By staining for CD31 (an endothelial cell marker) and
FosB in the NAT region, we saw a remarkable co-localization of
these markers (Fig. 6c; Supplementary Fig. 29). We conclude that
the TASA signature is highly activated specifically in the NAT
endothelial cells.
NAT can control for differential expression in cancer studies.
The analyses presented above highlight a crucial consideration
when performing differential expression analysis in cancer
research: the control set used in the analysis has a substantial
impact on findings. To demonstrate this issue we compared the
results from DEG analysis of tumor vs. NAT (T:A) and tumor vs.
healthy normal (T:H). The overall Pearson correlation of the
fold-changes between the analyses ranged 0.416–0.768 (Fig. 7;
Table 2; Supplementary Fig. 30). We found 55.3% more

difference was defined as Bonferroni corrected p-value < 0.001. b Left: Boxplots of ssGSEA scores of the 18-shared TASA signature. In 7 of 8 tissue types,
there is significant enrichment in NAT compared with both healthy and tumor. In colon, there is no enrichment compared with healthy, and can be
explained by the differential expression of the TASA genes between sigmoid and transverse colon (Supplementary Fig. 26). Top: median Spearman

 significant DEGs in tumor vs. healthy (T:H) than in tumor vs.
NAT (T:A). Across all tissues, 63.8% of the significant DEGs in T:
A are also significant in T:H (Fig. 7b). Finally, only a very limited
number of the significant DEGs are discordant between analyses:
58 genes are upregulated in T:A and downregulated in T:H on
average, and 46 show the opposite discordance (Fig. 7c). Thus, we
conclude that although using NAT as a control adequately
identifies the majority of differentially expressed genes in tumors,
using healthy tissues is more accurate and provides additional
information obscured when using NAT.
Discussion
It is clear that we must understand the myriad ways in which
cancer cells interact with their immediate, local, and remote
environments if we are to understand how tumors form and
thrive. This understanding, in turn, is vital for effective preven-
tion and therapy. In the last decade, several studies have inves-
tigated gene expression profiles of tumors’ surroundings, but the
biological
significance
of
these
findings
remains
poorly
understood.
The study of tumor biology, irrespective of approach, requires
controls. Using normal adjacent tissue as this control has many
advantages, such as the relative ease of access and the control for
variability between individuals and anatomic sites; however, in
comparing only tumor and NAT tissues, many potential cancer
biomarker candidates may be missed and others spuriously
implicated. Moreover, given the critical importance of NAT in
tumorigenesis, this approach may also obscure therapeutics tar-
gets present within the NAT itself. Here, we show that under-
standing the molecular differences between tumor-adjacent and
healthy tissues can directly reveal mechanisms used by the tumor
to communicate with the surrounding tissue.
The power of this study stems from its multi-tissue, multi-
cancer approach; by broadening the experimental aperture from a
single tissue and/or single tumor type to integrating information
across tissues types, we uncovered important general attributes of
tumor-adjacent tissues. It is clear that different cancer types pre-
sent unique tissue characterizations, such as the fibrosis or cir-
rhosis of the liver in most of the hepatocellular carcinoma patients;
however, our findings suggest that a universal mechanism that
characterizes NAT is apparent as well. Here, we have shown that
NAT is distinct from both healthy and tumor tissues, and that
many of these differences are not unique to a particular tumor
type but tend to be shared across types. We identified a set of
genes that are specifically overexpressed in NAT tissues compared
with both healthy tissues and tumors, and demonstrated a strong
association between this signature and TNF-α and TGF-β sig-
naling pathways, hypoxia, and EMT. It is important to emphasize
that studies that do not include healthy tissues will misidentify
TASA genes as selectively under-expressed in the tumor, whereas
in reality, these are actually expressed at normal levels in the
tumor but selectively induced in surrounding tissue.
Several
cancer
development
theories
can
explain
this
NAT-specific activation. Cancer often arises in the context of
prolonged inflammation48. The TASA signature, we uncovered
may be involved in systemic inflammation and specifically
induced in the acute phase reaction. However, according to this
hypothesis, it would be expected that this signature be also acti-
vated in tumors, not specifically in NAT as we observed. The
“wound that never heals” theory49, which implies that cellular
and biochemical processes associated with wound healing are
similar to those involved in the growth and development of
tumor stroma, strongly coincides with our findings of TASA
signature activation and the enrichment of inducers of blood
vessels. However, this theory concerns tumor stroma and not
tumor-adjacent tissue, which is histologically normal.
Here we explored a mechanism of tumor–environment inter-
action in which tumor-secreted factors influence the surrounding
tissue to promote tumor invasion and metastasis. Tumor hypoxia,
for example, is responsible for the expression of many different

 factors that induce EMT and vessel formation. One such factor is
HB-EGF, whose expression in tumors is associated with activation
of the TASA signature in paired NAT tissue50. We suggest that
secretion of this and other factors by the tumor activates a cas-
cade of transcription factors and enzymes associated with the
induction of TNF-α and TGF-β signaling pathways, which, in
turn, are prominent inducers of EMT, and are strongly activated
in the adjacent endothelium. In contrast to the field cancerization
theory, which implies an evolutionary process that forms the
NAT phenotype prior to frank tumorigenesis, we argue that the
tumor itself has an active role in shaping a unique, dynamic
phenotype in its adjacent tissue. Strong support for this notion
comes from our PDX experiment, where field effect or immune
response cannot explain the FosB activation in the contralateral
mammary gland. We suggest that the interaction with the tumor
may help shape the adjacent microenvironment, assembling its
unique tissue composition and inducing signaling pathways
responsible for the formation of the tissue.
A major limitation inherent to the integration of multiple
independently collected datasets is disparity between sample sets.
In this study, NAT and healthy tissues came from different
projects with different sample collection and sequencing proto-
cols. We have attempted to remedy this by standardizing analysis
pipelines, employing contemporary methods for removal of
unwanted variation, and confirming our findings in multiple
datasets generated by orthogonal methodology; however, we
cannot entirely disprove the possibility of batch effects. As with
any computationally based study, independent confirmation is
necessary for any further conclusions to be drawn. The simple
experiments we performed are just a first step towards such
experimental validation, and demonstrate that it is possible to
study NATs in tumor models such as PDXs. Another limitation
of this study is that no clear distance of the NAT samples is
available; thus, we were unable to determine whether the
observed NAT characteristics are unique to proximal non-tumor
cells or part of the disease process of entire organs that have been
exposed to carcinogenic stress. More data, such as the breast
cancer study, we re-analyzed36, containing multiple samples
around the tumor, could facilitate a better understanding of the
tumor surroundings and evaluation of our hypotheses.
Although the mechanisms that alter gene expression in NAT
remains to be validated, it is clear that NAT tissue has unique
characteristics differentiating it from healthy tissues. The strong
NAT-shared components across tumor types and tissue types
suggest that this editing of the adjacent tissue—more specifically,
the adjacent stroma—is an important mechanism, possibly
orchestrated by the tumor itself. Pietras and Östman51 suggested
that the interactions with the tumor stroma should be considered
as a hallmark of cancer. Here we broaden the scope of this
hallmark to include the adjacent stroma as well. We also suggest
that disruption of this complex interplay might represent a
potential novel therapeutic strategy in the treatment of cancer.
Methods
Data collection and processing. The analysis in this study focused on eight tissue
types and tumor types, which contain a sufficient number of NAT samples in
TCGA (N > 10), and the tissue of origin of the tumor is clear. For the eight tumor
types, we analyzed raw feature counts and FPKM values were downloaded from
NCBI’s Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) via accession number GSE6294423. We
further obtained raw reads files of the eight corresponding tissue types (GTEx
dbGaP accession phs000424.v6.p1, 18 November, 2015). The raw reads were then
processed and normalized using the Rsubread package (version 1.14.2)52 and
aligned to the UCSC hg19 reference genome according to the pipeline described in
Rahman et al.23 The summary of the number of samples is presented in Table 1,
and the processed GTEx expression profiles were deposited to GEO (accession
number GSE86354). We also obtained counts per million (CPM) values following
upper quartile normalization using the EDASeq package53.
Other datasets included in this study were downloaded from GEO (GSE44076,
GSE25097, GSE16113, GSE68555, and GSE5364) or EMBL-EBI ArrayExpress
(E-TABM-276). Raw CEL files were downloaded and processed using custom
CDFs from BrainArray (GSE44076, GSE68555, and E-TABM-276)54 and GEO
(GSE25097). The processing and normalization were performed using the Robust
Multi-array Average (RMA) procedure on Affymetrix microarray data. GSE16113
was not reprocessed, as it was not analyzed by a standard microarray.
Data analysis and statistical methods. Dimensionality reduction. Dimension-
ality reduction was performed using the Rtsne (version 0.10) package and the
EDASeq package on the log2 CPM values (RNA-seq), or log2 RMA values
(microarray). The deconvolution procedure was performed using the DeconR-
NASeq package29. This algorithm adopts a globally optimized non-negative
decomposition algorithm through quadratic programming for estimating the
mixing proportions of distinctive tissue types. Here we used two distinct tissue
types: the average expression levels of the healthy samples and the tumor samples.
Thus, the result of this procedure is a proportion of the “tumor contribution” to the
sample. Only genes with at least 10 reads in at least two samples were included for
the analysis.
Differential expression analysis. Batch effects and differences in sample
preparation can have substantial ramifications on the outcomes. Thus, we
performed a recently published stringent removal of unwanted variation method
for RNA-seq. We employed the RUVg method from the RUVSeq package30, which
performs factor analysis on residuals using a negative gene set that has constant
covariates. The negative set we used was a list of housekeeping genes55, which were
suggested by the developers of the method. This procedure diminished the
variations between datasets, as can be observed in the relative log expression (RLE),
which were typically low (<1) and undistinguishable between the conditions
(Supplementary Fig. 9). The normalization procedure was performed between pairs
of the three conditions in each tissue site independently, and differential expression
analysis was then performed using edgeR56 (Supplementary Datas 1 and 4). Only
genes with at least 10 reads in at least two samples were included for the analysis. A
gene was considered as differentially expressed if (1) Bonferroni corrected
p-value < 0.05, (2)>2-fold expression change, and (3) log2 CPM > 3. Genes were
divided to the nine expression models using the same rules—a gene with an
upregulation in NAT compared with healthy and downregulation in tumor
compared with NAT will be assigned to the “UD” expression model (or TASA) in
Fig. 4a and b (in red).
The chord diagram was created using NetworkAnalyst website (http://www.
networkanalyst.ca/). PPI networks were created using the STRING website (http://
string-db.org/). Upstream regulators analysis was performed using the Ingenuity
Pathway Analysis software.
Statistical significance test. To calculate p-values for the observed shared
number of genes across tissues in the different analyses, we used Poisson
approximation of the Binomial distribution for a null hypothesis of independence
between the tissues57. PPI enrichment p-values are presented as reported by the
STRING webtool.
Gene-set enrichment and tissue composition analyses. The GSEAPreranked
software58 was used to calculate normalized enrichment scores (NES) and (FDR)
values for the 50 Hallmark gene sets32. The genes were preranked according to the
log fold-change values. NES corresponds to the enrichment score (ES), which
reflects the degree to which a gene set is overrepresented at the top or bottom of a
ranked list of genes. The normalization is based on the gene-set enrichment scores
for all dataset permutations.
Tissue composition analysis of 30 immune and stroma cell types, those that are
assumed to reside in the tumor and tissue microenvironment, was performed using
xCell (version 1.0)46. xCell is a gene signatures-based method, which employs a
compensation technique to reduce spill-over effects between closely related cell
types. ssGSEA implemented in the GSVA package59 was used to score samples
according to the FPKM expression values of the 18-shared TASA genes.
Orthotopic xenograft studies. PDX samples (HCI-002, HCI-009 and HCI-010)
were generated and published by Dr Alana Welm and colleagues at the University
of Utah following local institutional review and patient consent. Briefly, donated
primary breast tumors and metastatic breast cancer cells were freshly obtained
following surgery and transplanted into cleared mammary fat pads of female
immunocompromised NOD/SCID mice38. For this study, we obtained 4-week-old
immunocompromised NOD/SCID/gamma female mice purchased from Jackson
Laboratory. The viably frozen HCI-002, HCI-009, and HCI-010 tumor samples
were transplanted into the cleared inguinal 4R mammary fat pads of NOD/SCID/
gamma mice. Tumor growth was monitored daily by caliper measurement in two
dimensions. When tumors reached 2 cm in any dimension (HCI-002—after
8 weeks on average, HCI-009 and HCI-010—12 weeks), mice were killed, and
tumor and NAT isolated from the 4R gland, and NCT from the 4L gland, and
flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. The protocols described in this section regarding
animal studies were approved by the UCSF Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee.
Immunoblot analysis. Proteins were extracted using RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-
HCl pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1%

 SDS, 2 mM EDTA) and proteinase (Roche) plus phosphatase (Roche) inhibitor
cocktails. Protein extracts were resolved using 4–12% SDS-PAGE gels (Life
Technologies) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Life Technologies).
Membranes were probed with primary antibodies overnight on a 4 °C shaker, then
incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies,
and signals were visualized with ECL (Bio-Rad). The primary antibodies targeting
the following proteins were used: β-actin (actin) (sc-47778 HRP, Santa Cruz,
1:10,000) and FosB (2251, Cell Signaling, 1:1000).
Immunofluorescence staining and microscopy. Breast cancers used for immu-
nofluorescence were identified and retrieved from the clinical archives of the
University of California San Francisco (UCSF) Department of Pathology. All
tumors consisted of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, progesterone receptor
(PR)-positive, HER2-negative invasive ductal carcinomas. Breast tissue was fixed in
10% formalin and embedded in paraffin. Tumor blocks with sufficient tumor and
adjacent (at least 0.5 cm) normal tissue were selected, and 4 µm sections were cut
on plus-charged slides for immunofluorescence. This study was approved by the
UCSF institutional review board. For immunofluorescence labeling, slides were
dewaxed in xylene followed by rehydration in graded ethanol (100, 95, 70%) and
deionized H2O. Antigen retrieval was performed in 10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA,
0.05% Tween 20, pH 9 at 121 °C for 4 min. Subsequently, tissue sections were
blocked in 1% bovine serum albumin, 2% fetal bovine serum in PBS for 5 min, and
incubated with primary antibodies (CD31, 3528, Cell Signaling, 1:100 and FosB,
2251, Cell Signaling, 1:100) overnight at 4 °C. Following several PBS washes, sec-
tions were incubated with Alexa Fluor-488 or -568 conjugated antibodies, coun-
terstained with DAPI (Sigma), and mounted using Vectashield (Vector).
Epifluorescence images were acquired by spinning disk microscopy on a custo-
mized microscope setup as previously described60–62 except that the system was
upgraded with a next generation scientific CCD camera (cMyo, 293 Photometrics)
with 4.5 μm pixels allowing optimal spatial sampling using a ×60 NA 1.49 objective
(CFI 294 APO TIRF; Nikon).
Data availability. Processed GTEx expression profiles were deposited as GEO
accession number GSE86354. All other datasets used in this manuscript are
available in public repositories and references are given in the text (see “Data
