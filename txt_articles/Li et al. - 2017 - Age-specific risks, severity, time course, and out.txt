Age-specific risks, severity, time course, and outcome of 
bleeding on long-term antiplatelet treatment after vascular 
events: a population-based cohort study
Linxin Li*, Olivia C Geraghty*, Ziyah Mehta, Peter M Rothwell, on behalf of the Oxford Vascular Study
Summary
Background Lifelong antiplatelet treatment is recommended after ischaemic vascular events, on the basis of trials 
done mainly in patients younger than 75 years. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding is a serious complication, but had low 
case fatality in trials of aspirin and is not generally thought to cause long-term disability. Consequently, although co-
prescription of proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) reduces upper gastrointestinal bleeds by 70–90%, uptake is low and 
guidelines are conflicting. We aimed to assess the risk, time course, and outcomes of bleeding on antiplatelet 
treatment for secondary prevention in patients of all ages.
Methods We did a prospective population-based cohort study in patients with a first transient ischaemic attack, 
ischaemic stroke, or myocardial infarction treated with antiplatelet drugs (mainly aspirin based, without routine PPI 
use) after the event in the Oxford Vascular Study from 2002 to 2012, with follow-up until 2013. We determined type, 
severity, outcome (disability or death), and time course of bleeding requiring medical attention by face-to-face follow-
up for 10 years. We estimated age-specific numbers needed to treat (NNT) to prevent upper gastrointestinal bleeding 
with routine PPI co-prescription on the basis of Kaplan–Meier risk estimates and relative risk reduction estimates 
from previous trials.
Findings 3166 patients (1582 [50%] aged ≥75 years) had 405 first bleeding events (n=218 gastrointestinal, n=45 
intracranial, and n=142 other) during 13 509 patient-years of follow-up. Of the 314 patients (78%) with bleeds admitted 
to hospital, 117 (37%) were missed by administrative coding. Risk of non-major bleeding was unrelated to age, but 
major bleeding increased steeply with age (≥75 years hazard ratio [HR] 3·10, 95% CI 2·27–4·24; p<0·0001), particularly 
for fatal bleeds (5·53, 2·65–11·54; p<0·0001), and was sustained during long-term follow-up. The same was true of 
major upper gastrointestinal bleeds (≥75 years HR 4·13, 2·60–6·57; p<0·0001), particularly if disabling or fatal (10·26, 
4·37–24·13; p<0·0001). At age 75 years or older, major upper gastrointestinal bleeds were mostly disabling or fatal 
(45 [62%] of 73 patients vs 101 [47%] of 213 patients with recurrent ischaemic stroke), and outnumbered disabling or 
fatal intracerebral haemorrhage (n=45 vs n=18), with an absolute risk of 9·15 (95% CI 6·67–12·24) per 1000 patient-
years. The estimated NNT for routine PPI use to prevent one disabling or fatal upper gastrointestinal bleed over 5 years 
fell from 338 for individuals younger than 65 years, to 25 for individuals aged 85 years or older.
Interpretation In patients receiving aspirin-based antiplatelet treatment without routine PPI use, the long-term risk 
of major bleeding is higher and more sustained in older patients in practice than in the younger patients in previous 
trials, with a substantial risk of disabling or fatal upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Given that half of the major bleeds 
in patients aged 75 years or older were upper gastrointestinal, the estimated NNT for routine PPI use to prevent such 
bleeds is low, and co-prescription should be encouraged.

Introduction
Roughly 40–66% of adults aged 75 years or older in the 
USA and Europe take daily aspirin or other antiplatelet 
drugs,1,2 about half for secondary prevention of vascular 
disease, consistent with guideline recommendations 
for lifelong treatment.3,4 Antiplatelet drugs increase 
the risk of major bleeding, particularly upper 
gastrointestinal bleeds,5 but this risk is reduced by 
70–90% by proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs; trials are 
summarised in the appendix [p 2]).6 However, co-
prescription of PPIs is not routine because of concerns 
about adverse effects,7–10 and perhaps because upper 
gastrointestinal bleeds had a low case fatality in trials of 
aspirin11 and are not generally thought to cause 
permanent disability. Clinical guidelines on secondary 
prevention of vascular events make no recommendations 
on PPI use3,4 and, although some consensus statements 
advocate use of these drugs in high-risk patients,12

definitions of high risk vary and uptake in practice 
remains low.9,10
Because the absolute benefit of routine PPI use will 
depend mainly on the risk of upper gastrointestinal 
bleeding on long-term follow-up, and about half of 
patients 
taking 
antiplatelet 
drugs 
for 
secondary 
prevention are now aged 75 years or older (appendix 
pp 3–5), we need reliable estimates of age-specific risks 
and consequences of bleeding in a real-world setting. 
The risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding on antiplatelet 
treatment increases with age,13–15 but it is uncertain 
whether older age alone is a sufficient indicator of high 
risk to justify routine co-prescription of PPIs. Published 
estimates of age-specific risks of bleeding vary by more 
than ten fold, particularly at older ages, and derive mainly 
from primary prevention settings,16 with relatively short 
follow-up.13–16 Completeness of ascertainment of bleeding 
events is also uncertain in many studies because of a 
reliance on only administrative coding data. Previous 
trials (appendix pp 3–5) of antiplatelet drugs with face-to-
face follow-up probably have better ascertainment, but 
recruited few patients aged 75 years or older, tended to 
exclude high-risk patients, and had relatively short 
follow-up times. Although the excess risk of bleeding 
attributable to aspirin declined after several years of 
follow-up in trials of primary prevention,11 the time 
course of bleeding risk in older patients receiving 
treatment for secondary prevention is uncertain and data 
for the functional outcome of upper gastrointestinal 
bleeds are scarce.
We aimed to determine the age-specific risks, site, 
severity, 
outcomes, 
time 
course, 
and 
predictors 
of bleeding complications in secondary prevention of 
vascular events, to compare the risks with those of 
recurrent ischaemic events and those reported in 
previous randomised trials, and to estimate the potential 
effect of routine PPI use on reducing bleeding.
Methods
Study design and participants
We did a population-based cohort study in consecutive 
patients who were first in the study period to have 
acute transient ischaemic attack, ischaemic stroke, or 
myocardial infarction, and were treated with antiplatelet 
drugs (ie, started anew or continued) in the Oxford 
Vascular Study (OXVASC) from 2002 to 2012, with 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Lifelong antiplatelet treatment is recommended after 
ischaemic vascular events on the basis of trials done at 
younger ages (mainly <75 years). Bleeding is a serious 
complication, but is most commonly upper gastrointestinal, 
which has had low case fatality in previous trials and is not 
generally thought to cause long-term disability. 
Consequently, although proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) 
reduce upper gastrointestinal bleeds by 70–90%, uptake in 
clinical practice is low and guidelines on secondary 
prevention of vascular events make no recommendations on 
PPI use. Although some consensus statements have 
recommended co-prescription for high-risk patients, 
definitions of high risk vary. Yet little is known about the risk, 
time course, or functional outcomes of upper 
gastrointestinal bleeding at older ages (≥75 years) in routine 
clinical practice. We searched PubMed with the terms 
“antiplatelet and secondary prevention”, “antiplatelet and 
bleeding”, “aspirin and bleeding”, “GI bleeding”, “gastric 
protection and GI bleeding”, and “age and bleeding” for 
articles published in English before Jan 1, 2017. Published 
estimates of age-specific risks of bleeding vary by more than 
ten fold, particularly at older ages, and derive mainly from 
primary prevention settings, with reliance on administrative 
coding data only. We found no published data for the 
long-term time course of bleeding risk in older patients in 
secondary prevention, and no data for the functional 
outcome of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Although the 
risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding on antiplatelet 
treatment increases with age, it is uncertain whether older 
age alone is a sufficient indicator of high risk and hence 
routine co-prescription of PPIs.
Added value of this study
The findings of our large prospective population-based 
study of long-term antiplatelet treatment in secondary 
prevention of vascular disease show that the severity, case 
fatality, and poor functional outcome of bleeds increase 
with age. Moreover, in contrast with the general impression 
that upper gastrointestinal bleeds are mostly non-disabling 
with low case fatality, we showed that in patients aged 
75 years or older, most major upper gastrointestinal bleeds 
were disabling or fatal, substantially outnumbering 
disabling or fatal intracerebral haemorrhage. Finally, we 
provided estimates of the likely effect of routine PPI use in 
patients aged 75 years or older on prevention of major 
upper gastrointestinal bleeds.
Implications of all the available evidence
In patients receiving secondary prevention with 
aspirin-based antiplatelet treatment without routine PPI 
use, the long-term risk of bleeding at age 75 years or older is 
much higher and more sustained than in the younger age 
groups included in previous trials, with particularly high 
risks of disabling or fatal upper gastrointestinal bleeding. 
Given that half of the major bleeds in patients aged 75 years 
or older were upper gastrointestinal, the estimated numbers 
needed to treat for routine PPI use to prevent major upper 
gastrointestinal bleed are low, and should be considered in 
future secondary prevention guidelines.

follow-up until 2013. OXVASC is a population-based 
study of the incidence and outcome of all acute vascular 
events in a population of 92 728 individuals, irrespective 
of age, registered with 100 general practitioners in nine 
general practices in Oxfordshire, UK. The definitions of 
vascular events and the multiple overlapping methods 
used to achieve near complete ascertainment of all 
individuals with transient ischaemic attack, stroke, or 
myocardial infarction are detailed in the appendix 
(pp 34, 35) and have been reported previously.17
We excluded patients who started or continued oral 
anticoagulants after an event, but included those 
receiving premorbid oral anticoagulants who were 
switched to antiplatelet therapy after the event. Patients 
who took anticoagulants during subsequent follow-up 
were censored at the time of starting permanent 
anticoagulation. We excluded patients who were not 
given antithrombotic drugs because of recent bleeding, 
coagulation disorders, known allergy, other known 
bleeding tendency, or a decision for palliative care only.
Written informed consent, or assent from relatives, was 
obtained from all participants, and OXVASC has been 
approved by the local ethics committee.
Procedures
Demographics and vascular risk factors were obtained at 
initial assessment, as were risk factors for bleeding, 
including alcohol use, anaemia, history of peptic ulcer, 
renal failure, chronic liver disease, history of cancer, and 
weight. All medications taken before the event, at 
discharge, and at follow-up were recorded.
In patients with transient ischaemic attack and 
ischaemic stroke, long-term recommended antiplatelet 
treatment was aspirin (75 mg daily) plus dipyridamole 
(200 mg twice daily). In patients seen within 48 h of their 
acute event, or those seen later who were at high early 
risk of recurrent stroke (eg, ABCD2 score ≥4), initial 
treatment was with aspirin plus clopidogrel (75 mg daily) 
for 30 days. In patients with myocardial infarction, 
standard treatment was with aspirin plus clopidogrel for 
6–12 months, followed by aspirin alone. No PPI or other 
gastric protection strategies were routinely co-prescribed. 
Brain imaging was required before initiation of 
antiplatelet treatment after stroke.
Patients were followed up face to face at 30 days, 
6 months, and years 1, 5, and 10 by a study nurse or 
physician. Recurrent ischaemic events, bleeding events, 
and disability (modified Rankin Scale)18 were recorded at 
each follow-up visit. Follow-up was done via a carer in 
patients with dementia, and by telephone in patients who 
had moved out of the study area. Bleeding events 
were also identified by daily searches of all hospital 
admissions,17 by review of administrative diagnostic 
codes from hospital and primary care records, and by 
regular searches of blood transfusion records. All deaths 
(with causes) during follow-up were also recorded from 
death certificates and coroners’ reports.17 We included 
only bleeding events for which the patient had sought 
medical attention or that were fatal before attention 
being sought. We excluded minor bleeds, such as 
bruising, that had not necessitated medical attention. We 
also excluded bleeds secondary to major trauma, major 
surgical procedures, or haematological malignancy.
Site of bleeding was classified as intracranial (intra-
cerebral, subdural, or subarachnoid) and extracranial 
(upper gastrointestinal, lower gastrointestinal, epistaxis, 
genitourinary, and other). Cases of melaena without 
investigation or with normal investigations were classified 
as upper gastrointestinal. We used the Clopidogrel in 
Unstable angina to prevent Recurrent Events (CURE) 
criteria (appendix p 37)19 to define bleeding events as 
major and life-threatening or fatal. Bleeding events that 
required medical attention but did not fulfil the criteria 
for major bleed were defined as significant non-major 
bleeds. Bleeds were defined as disabling if they resulted in 
a deterioration in functional independence (modified 
Rankin Scale increased to ≥3, or increased by ≥1 point if 
premorbid modified Rankin Scale ≥3) at hospital discharge 
without recovery by the next follow-up visit. The cause of 
disability was coded, when possible, and included 
complications triggered directly by the bleed, such as 
myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke, or heart failure.
Statistical analyses
We derived estimates of risk from Kaplan–Meier analyses. 
In patients who had multiple bleeding events of the same 
severity, the first event was classified as the endpoint, 
irrespective of any difference in the type of events. 
However, in analysis of risk of more serious bleeds (ie, 
major bleeds, life-threatening or fatal bleeds, disabling or 
fatal bleeds) patients were not censored at the time of any 
preceding significant non-major bleed. In all analyses of

risk of bleeding events, patients were censored at the time 
of starting permanent anticoagulation.
Age-specific (<75 years vs ≥75 years, and 5 year bands) 
risks of bleeding events were determined by site, severity, 
outcome (fatal, disabling, or non-disabling), and type of 
initial ischaemic event (cerebrovascular vs myocardial 
infarction), with further stratification by source of data 
(administrative coding alone vs all sources). Risks were 
presented both as an annual rate, which is an averaged 
rate (%) derived as number per 100 patient-years, or as 
cumulative risk (%). 
We compared the risks of major bleeding in OXVASC 
patients after transient ischaemic attack or ischaemic 
stroke with the risks of major bleeding reported in trials 
of aspirin-based secondary prevention after transient 
ischaemic attack or ischaemic stroke individually and 
after pooling (Mantel–Haenszel–Peto method). Because 
the mean follow-up time in aspirin-based secondary 
prevention trials was 2·6 years, we used the 3 year risks 
in OXVASC.
We used Cox regression to determine predictors of 
major bleeding and of major upper gastrointestinal 
bleeding, adjusted for age, sex, and risk factors 
(appendix p 36). Risk factors that approached significance 
(p<0·10) in the age-adjusted and sex-adjusted regression 
were entered into a multivariable analysis. We also 
stratified the risks of major bleeding and major upper 
gastrointestinal bleeding by the externally derived 
Reduction of Atherothrombosis for Continued Health 
(REACH) bleeding score (appendix p 38)20 overall and 
by age (<75 years vs ≥75 years). Prognostic value was 
expressed as area under the receiver operator 
characteristic (ROC) curve.
In addition to risks of bleeding, we also determined 
the long-term risks of recurrent ischaemic vascular 
events (ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarction, and 
sudden cardiac death), with exclusion of patients with 
atrial fibrillation at baseline. We then compared the 
ratios of major bleeding risk with ischaemic event risk 
stratified by age and REACH score, and compared the 
3 year ratios with reported ratios in aspirin-based 
secondary prevention trials. We also estimated the 
probable ratios of risk over benefits attributable to 
antiplatelet treatment in each age group (appendix p 36) 
on the basis of a previous systematic review.5 For upper 
gastrointestinal bleeding, we estimated the age-specific 
numbers needed to treat (NNT) with PPIs to prevent 
one bleed on the basis of the cumulative risks from 
the Kaplan–Meier curve,21 by use of the reported 
relative risk of 0·26 from a previous systematic review 
(appendix p 2).6 The appendix (p 36) provides details of 
sensitivity analyses. We did all analyses with SPSS 
(version 20).

appendix p 7) were older than those not receiving 
protection and, after adjustment for age, were more likely 
to be anaemic and to have had previous peptic ulcer, 
vascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, and hyper-
lipidaemia (appendix p 7). Use of gastric protection 
increased to 32% (n=947) among 2914 survivors by 
1-month follow-up and was maintained at 1-year 
follow-up (852 [33%] among 2583 survivors). At 1 year, 
2301 patients (89%) were receiving antiplatelet treatment 
and 77 (3%) had switched to oral anticoagulants; at 5 years, 
1042 (87%) of 1199 patients were receiving antiplatelet 
treatment and 19 (2%) were receiving anticoagulants.
Of 405 bleeding events (187 major bleeds) presenting to 
medical attention during 13 509 patient-years of follow-up, 
162 (40%; 97 major bleeds) were upper gastrointestinal 
(appendix p 8). The average annual risk of bleeding was 
3·36% (95% CI 3·04–3·70; 1·46%, 1·26–1·68 for major 
bleeds). Risks were similar after transient ischaemic attack 
or stroke versus myocardial infarction (appendix p 9), but 
the proportion of major bleeds that were intracerebral was 
higher (odds ratio [OR] 2·76, 95% CI 1·06–7·23; p=0·03). 
390 bleeds (96%) occurred during antiplatelet treatment.
Of the 314 bleeding events (78%) that required or 
occurred during hospital admission, 120 (38%) were not 
recorded in routine hospital administrative coding, 
whereas three (1%) non-bleeding events were miscoded 
as bleeds (figure 1, table 2). 73 (39%) of 187 major bleeding 
events were missed by routine coding alone (table 2), 
including 43 (44%) of 97 upper gastrointestinal bleeds, 
although 36 (80%) of 45 intracranial haemorrhages were 
identified.
Risk of non-major bleeds was unrelated to age and risk 
of major bleeds did not increase with age in patients 
younger than 70 years (figure 2, appendix p 10). The 
mean age of patients in previous trials of aspirin for 
secondary prevention of transient ischaemic attack or 
stroke was 63 years, and most were younger than 
75 years (appendix pp 3–5, 11). The average annual risk 
of major bleeding in OXVASC patients with transient 
ischaemic attack or stroke younger than 75 years during 
the first 3 years of follow-up (1·1%, 95% CI 0·7–1·6; 
mean age 62 years [SD 10·3]) was similar to the annual 
risk of major bleeding reported in the previous trials 
(pooled risk 1·0%, 0·8–1·1; appendix pp 11, 12).
The annual risk of major bleeds in OXVASC increased 
steeply above age 70 years (figure 2), reaching 4·1% at 
age 85 years or older, with similar patterns for both life-
threatening and fatal bleeds, reflecting high risks of

ages (appendix p 10). Results were similar in analyses 
confined to patients still receiving antiplatelet treatment

See figure 1. Data are n/N or n/N (%). Major bleeds were bleeds that were substantially disabling with persistent sequelae, intraocular bleeding leading to significant loss of 
vision, or bleeding requiring transfusion of 2 or more units of blood. *91 patients that required medical attention were not admitted but presented to general practitioners 
(n=71) or treated in hospital without being admitted overnight (n=20). †Related diagnosis included anaemia, diverticular disease, oesophagitis, or gastritis.

appendix p 13). The antiplatelet regimen at the time of 
bleeding did not differ with age (appendix p 14).
The annual risk of major bleeding was higher in 
patients aged 75 years or older at baseline than in those 
younger than 75 years, both at 3 years (hazard ratio 
[HR] 2·73, 1·95–3·82; p<0·0001) and at 10 years (3·10, 
2·27–4·24; p<0·0001). The increased 10 year risk was 
most prominent for upper gastrointestinal bleeds (4·13, 
2·60–6·57; p<0·0001; appendix p 15). Results were 
similar between patients with transient ischaemic attack 
or stroke and those with myocardial infarction (appendix 
p 16). 
Patients aged 75 years or older also had more severe 
bleeds than those aged younger than 75 years (ptrend<0·0001; 
table 1, figure 3).
The outcome of non-fatal bleeds was also worse at 
older ages (table 1, figure 3, appendix pp 17, 18 lists the 
reasons for bleed-associated disability or death). The 
proportion of survivors in whom an extracranial bleed 
resulted in new or a sustained increase in disability 
increased with age (four [3%] of 157 patients <75 years vs 
46 [25%] of 183 patients ≥75 years; OR 12·8, 95% CI 
4·5–36·6; p<0·0001), particularly after major upper 
gastrointestinal bleeds (three [14%] of 21 vs 31 [53%] of 
59 patients; disability or death: six [25%] of 24 vs 45 [62%] 
of 73 patients; table 1), such that the long-term risk of 
disabling or fatal upper gastrointestinal bleeding was 
ten times higher at age 75 years or older (HR 10·26, 
95% CI 4·37–24·13, p<0·0001; absolute risk 9·15, 95% 
CI 6·67–12·24 per 1000 patient-years), substantially 
outnumbering disabling or fatal intracerebral bleeds 
(n=18).
The annual risk of bleeding events reduced over time 
(appendix p 9), both in patients treated initially with 
aspirin plus clopidogrel and in those patients on 
monotherapy (appendix p 19), after both myocardial 
infarction and cerebrovascular events (appendix p 9), and 
after exclusion of the first 90 days after index events 
(appendix p 20). However, the risks of major bleeding 
were more sustained in patients aged 75 years or older 
than in those younger than 75 years (time-dependent 
interaction p=0·032; appendix p 21), even in those 
receiving premorbid antiplatelet drugs already at baseline 
(appendix p 22) and for major upper gastrointestinal 
bleed (appendix p 23). The risk was most sustained in 
patients aged 75–84 years (appendix p 22).
The associations of major bleeding and major upper 
gastrointestinal bleeding with age were independent of 
sex, history of vascular disease, vascular risk factors, and 
history of peptic ulcer (table 3). The 5 year risk increased 
with the REACH risk score in patients younger than 
75 years (appendix p 24; major bleeds area under the 
ROC curve 0·61, 95% CI 0·54–0·69; p=0·004; major 
upper gastrointestinal bleeds 0·65, 0·54–0·76; p=0·014), 
but not at age 75 years or older (major bleed 0·51, 
0·46–0·56; p=0·69; major upper gastrointestinal bleed 
0·50, 0·43–0·57; p=0·93).
489 non-fatal and 208 fatal ischaemic vascular events 
occurred during follow-up. The absolute risks of major 
bleeding versus ischaemic events increased with age and 
REACH score (appendix p 25). In patients younger than 
75 years, the ratio of major bleeds to ischaemic events

(symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage, fall in haemoglobin of ≥5 g/dL, hypotension requiring intravenous 
inotropes, or required surgical intervention or transfusion of ≥4 units of blood).

(0·20, 95% CI 0·14–0·27) was similar to the ratios in 
previous aspirin trials (pooled ratio 0·19, 0·17–0·21; 
appendix p 11). However, the ratio in OXVASC increased 
with age (75–84 years 0·32, 0·23–0·43; ≥85 years 0·46, 
0·32–0·67; appendix pp 25, 26), and the risk of major 
bleeds estimated to be attributable to antiplatelet 
treatment approached the risk of ischaemic events 
estimated to have been prevented (appendix pp 27). 
Results were consistent in sensitivity analysis censoring 
at the time of either a first major bleed or a first ischaemic 
event (appendix pp 28, 29). Moreover, severity of 
recurrent ischaemic strokes did not increase with age, 
with less than half (101 [47%] of 213) being disabling or 
fatal at age 75 years or older.
In the only published meta-analysis6 of randomised 
trials of PPIs versus placebo in patients taking antiplatelet 
drugs (predominantly aspirin), PPI use reduced upper 
gastrointestinal bleeding by 74% (appendix p 2). When 
we used this estimate, the NNT with PPIs to prevent one 
major upper gastrointestinal bleed at 5 year follow-up 
decreased with increasing age: 80 for patients younger 
than 65 years, 75 for patients aged 65–74 years, 23 for 
patients aged 75–84 years, and 21 for patients aged 
85 years or older (appendix p 30). The NNT with PPIs to 
prevent one disabling or fatal upper gastrointestinal 
bleed at 5 year follow-up also decreased, from 338 for 
patients younger than 65 years to 25 for patients aged 
85 years or older (appendix p 30). The outcomes were 
similar in analyses excluding patients with history of 
peptic ulcer or those receiving premorbid gastric 
protection treatment (appendix p 31).
Discussion
In this large prospective population-based study, the 
long-term risks and severity of bleeding in patients 
receiving 
predominantly 
aspirin-based 
secondary 
prevention in 
creased steeply with age. Although the risks 
of major bleeding in patients aged younger than 75 years 
were similar to the risks in previous trials of aspirin and 
other antiplatelet drugs, the risks at older ages were 
higher and more sustained than at younger ages, and the 
functional outcome was much worse, with a substantial 
risk of disabling or fatal upper gastrointestinal bleeding.
The increase with age in risk of bleeding on antiplatelet 
treatment is in line with previous studies.13–15,22 One 
retrospective cohort study23 showed that anti 
thrombotic-
associated gastrointestinal bleeds had high rates of 
hospital admission and transfusion at older ages, one 
study15 found that in patients aged 85 years or older the 
gastrointestinal tract was the most common location of 
fatal haemorrhage after ischaemic stroke, and one study24 
reported higher rates of complications and peptic ulcer-
related mortality in elderly patients, but these studies did 
not report age-specific data for functional outcome or 
case fatality from upper gastrointestinal bleeding. We 
have shown that severity, case fatality, and poor functional 
outcome increase steeply with age.
The mechanisms underlying poor outcomes after upper 
gastrointestinal bleeding at older ages are multifactorial.25 
We found that complications, such as thrombotic events 
and worsening heart failure, were common, but the 
reasons for functional decline were often unclear. Further 
research is needed to understand the determinants of 
poor outcomes, including the effect of withdrawal versus

continuation of antiplatelet treatment in the acute 
phase,26–28 but our results highlight the need for more 
rigorous prevention of bleeds in the first place.
In relation to prevention of upper gastrointestinal 
bleeding, research into the effectiveness of Helicobacter 
pylori screening and eradication in older patients already 
receiving antiplatelet treatment is underway,29 but gastric 
protection strategies otherwise focus on PPIs, which 
reduce upper gastrointestinal bleeding by 70–90% in 
patients receiving long-term antiplatelet treatment.6,30 
However, consistent with other UK or European 
studies,9,10 PPI use in patients receiving long-term 
antiplatelet treatment in our study was only about 30%. 
We did not routinely co-prescribe PPIs, partly because 
clinical guidelines on secondary prevention of vascular 
events make no specific recommendations on PPI use,3,4 
and partly because no accepted definition exists of 
patients at high risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding.12 
However, our results suggest that in secondary 
prevention setting, an age of 75 years or older alone is 
sufficient to define patients at high-risk, with a reasonable 
NNT to prevent one major upper gastrointestinal bleed.

Age 75 years would be an appropriate threshold to start a 
PPI both in patients newly initiated on antiplatelet drugs 
and in patients on established treatment. Use of an age-
based criterion is also supported by the poor performance 
of the REACH score in further risk stratification at older 
ages, although our risk factor analysis suggests that 
prognostication could be improved. Moreover, we limited 
our estimation of the potential benefits of routine co-
prescription of PPIs only to acute bleeding events, 
but anaemia and peptic ulcer perforation without 
gastrointestinal bleeding should also be reduced.6
Non-upper gastrointestinal bleeds constituted 60% of 
all bleeds and 48% of major bleeds in our study 
population, highlighting the importance of prevention, 
particularly control of blood pressure in preventing 
intracranial bleed. 
As expected, the risk of recurrent ischaemic events also 
increased with age, but the relative excess of ischaemic 
over major bleeding events diminished. Moreover, 
in patients aged 75 years or older, major upper 
gastrointestinal bleeding was at least as likely to be 
disabling or fatal as recurrent ischaemic stroke. In 
secondary prevention of vascular disease, aspirin reduces 
the long-term relative risk of major ischaemic events by 
about 20%, but doubles the relative risk of major 
bleeding.5 In our study, for patients younger than 
75 years, the ratios of major bleeding over ischaemic risk 
were similar to those in previous randomised trials of 
aspirin. However, this ratio increased with age, raising 
questions about the balance of risk and benefit of long-
term antiplatelet treatment in this age group if a PPI is 
not co-prescribed. Although short-term benefit from 
anti 
platelet 
treatment 
is 
clear,31 
and 
sudden 
discontinuation is hazardous,26–28 a trial of gradual 
withdrawal would be justifiable in patients for whom 
long-term gastric protection is not acceptable.
Strengths of our study are its prospective population-
based design with inclusion of all treated patients 
irrespective of age and frailty, long-term face-to-face 
follow-up, reliable ascertainment of bleeding events 
through multiple sources, and assessment of functional 
outcome, but there are some limitations. First, some 
analyses combined patients with cerebrovascular and 
coronary vascular events, although the early risk of 
bleeding might be higher after coronary events because 
of interventional strategies and greater use of dual 
antiplatelet therapy. However, the risk of bleeding and 
the association with age were similar when only bleeds 
occurring with single antiplatelet treatment were 
included. Second, although we had data for all prescribed 
medication of follow-up, and very few bleeds occurred 
secondary to prescribed non-steroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs (NSAIDs) or corticosteroids, we might have 
missed data for over-the-counter use of NSAIDs. Third, 
we found that non-major significant bleeding was 
unrelated to age, but older patients might be less likely to 
identify and report minor bleeding. However, any under-
ascertainment of more minor bleeds at older ages would 
not alter our conclusions about the absolute risk of major 
bleeding. Fourth, we defined severity of bleeds using the 
CURE trial criteria, but no consensus exists about the 
optimal categorisation.32 Fifth, the estimated age-specific 
NNT for PPI use in prevention of upper gastrointestinal 
bleeds was based on the assumptions that the efficacy of 
PPIs was the same for prevention of any bleed versus 
major bleed, was similar at different ages, and remained 
consistent with time. Sixth, our results focused mainly 
on aspirin-based antiplatelet treatment in secondary 
prevention because only a few of our patients were 
receiving long-term clopidogrel. However, the only 
previous large randomised trial33 of aspirin versus 
clopidogrel in secondary prevention of vascular events 
showed no significant difference in risk of major 
bleeding. Seventh, the predominant aspirin formulation 
in our cohort was 75 mg enteric coated, which will limit 
generalisability to countries in which other doses or 
formulations are common. Eighth, we did not attempt to 
estimate the number needed to harm in relation to 
potential adverse effects of long-term PPI use. In the 
absence of large randomised trials of long-term 
treatment, reliable estimation of any hazard is difficult 
(appendix p 39 lists detailed discussion for harms).7,34–36 
Ninth, for the estimated net benefit of antiplatelet 
treatment, our estimates might have been conservative. 
We applied the reported two-times increased risk of 
major bleeding on aspirin in secondary prevention trials 
to all age groups and to all types of bleeding in our non-
trial population. Finally, in our multivariable analyses of 
the association of age and major bleeding, we adjusted 
for known risk factors, but residual confounding cannot 
be excluded.
In conclusion, in secondary prevention with aspirin-
based antiplatelet treatment without routine PPI use, the 
long-term risk of bleeding at age 75 years or older is 
higher and more sustained than in the younger age 
groups included in previous trials, with particularly high 
risks of disabling or fatal upper gastrointestinal bleeding. 
Given that half of the major bleeds in patients aged 
75 years or older were upper gastrointestinal, the 
estimated NNT for routine PPI use to prevent major 
upper gastrointestinal bleed is low and co-prescription 
should be considered in future secondary prevention 
guidelines. More research is still required into how best 
to identify patients at high risk of bleeding, how to reduce 
the risk of non-upper gastrointestinal bleeds, and into 
the overall balance of risks and benefits of long-term 
antiplatelet treatment at older ages in both primary and 
secondary prevention.
