Abstract
Background
Sodium consumption is a modifiable risk factor for higher blood pressure (BP) and cardio-
vascular disease (CVD). The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has proposed volun-
tary sodium reduction goals targeting processed and commercially prepared foods. We
aimed to quantify the potential health and economic impact of this policy.
Methods and findings
We used a microsimulation approach of a close-to-reality synthetic population (US IMPACT
Food Policy Model) to estimate CVD deaths and cases prevented or postponed, quality-
adjusted life years (QALYs), and cost-effectiveness from 2017 to 2036 of 3 scenarios: (1)
optimal, 100% compliance with 10-year reformulation targets; (2) modest, 50% compliance
with 10-year reformulation targets; and (3) pessimistic, 100% compliance with 2-year refor-
mulation targets, but with no further progress. We used the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey and high-quality meta-analyses to inform model inputs. Costs included
government costs to administer and monitor the policy, industry reformulation costs, and
CVD-related healthcare, productivity, and informal care costs. Between 2017 and 2036, the
optimal reformulation scenario achieving the FDA sodium reduction targets could prevent
approximately 450,000 CVD cases (95% uncertainty interval: 240,000 to 740,000), gain
approximately 2.1 million discounted QALYs (1.7 million to 2.4 million), and produce dis-
counted cost savings (health savings minus policy costs) of approximately $41 billion ($14

 billion to $81 billion). In the modest and pessimistic scenarios, health gains would be 1.1 mil-
lion and 0.7 million QALYS, with savings of $19 billion and $12 billion, respectively. All the
scenarios were estimated with more than 80% probability to be cost-effective (incremental
cost/QALY < $100,000) by 2021 and to become cost-saving by 2031. Limitations include
evaluating only diseases mediated through BP, while decreasing sodium consumption
could have beneficial effects upon other health burdens such as gastric cancer. Further, the
effect estimates in the model are based on interventional and prospective observational
studies. They are therefore subject to biases and confounding that may have influenced
also our model estimates.
Conclusions
Implementing and achieving the FDA sodium reformulation targets could generate substan-
tial health gains and net cost savings.
Author summary
Why was this study done?
• Sodium consumption is a leading modifiable risk factor for high blood pressure and car-
diovascular disease in the US and worldwide. The US Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) has proposed 2-year and 10-year voluntary sodium reduction targets for pro-
cessed foods.
• The potential health and economic effects of successful implementation of the FDA’s
voluntary reformulation proposal have not been quantified and would be of great inter-
est to policy makers.
What did the researchers do and find?
• We modeled and compared the potential health and economic effects of 3 scenarios of
differing implementation of the FDA’s proposed voluntary sodium reformulation policy
over a 20-year period.
• We found that the optimal scenario—100% compliance with the 10-year FDA targets—
could prevent approximately 450,000 CVD cases, result in the gain of 2.1 million qual-
ity-adjusted life years (QALYs), and produce discounted cost savings of approximately
$41 billion. In contrast, the modest scenario (50% compliance with the 10-year FDA tar-
gets) and the pessimistic scenario (100% compliance with the 2-year targets but no fur-
ther progress) could yield health and economic gains half and a quarter as large,
respectively.
• All 3 scenarios had a greater than 80% probability of being cost-effective by 2021 (incre-
mental cost-effectiveness ratio < $100,000 per QALY) and cost-saving by 2031.

Introduction
Sodium consumption is a leading modifiable risk factor for higher blood pressure (BP) and
cardiovascular disease (CVD) [1]. The excess risk associated with sodium consumption
appears to be mainly mediated through the deleterious effect of excess sodium consumption
on BP [2]. CVD remains the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in the US, generating
approximately 800,000 deaths and 6 million hospital admissions annually [3]. These CVD
burdens cost $318 billion annually in healthcare costs and an additional $237 billion in lost
productivity, with further costs of informal care [4]. Average sodium intake in the US is
approximately 3,400 milligrams per person per day, or 8.6 grams of salt, approximately 50%
above the recommended upper bound consumption level of 2,300 mg/day [5]. About 75% of
sodium intake comes from processed and commercially produced foods, making industry
reformulation a major priority for reducing population sodium intake [6,7].
Consistent with World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations and other volun-
tary reformulation policies that have effectively lowered sodium intake in Finland, Turkey,
and the United Kingdom [8], the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2016 proposed
short-term (2 year) and long-term (10 year) voluntary, category-specific sodium reformulation
targets for commercially processed, packaged, and prepared foods across 155 food categories
[9]. This proposal was designed to support the 2015–2020 US dietary guidelines by encourag-
ing food reformulation and new product development [5].
However, the potential health and economic effects of these proposed targets have not been
quantified. In addition, in both the 2017 congressional budget and the current proposed 2018
House of Representatives agriculture appropriations bill, the US Congress has instructed the
FDA not “to develop, issue, promote or advance final guidance applicable to food manufactur-
ers for long term population-wide sodium reduction,” at least in part because of uncertainty
about potential health effects. Recent studies have estimated the potential health gains of gen-
eral sodium reduction in the US population, but without mapping the effects of the specific
FDA-proposed policies for industry or taking a wider societal perspective [10]. In this study,
we quantified the potential reductions in CVD and the economic impact of different levels of
compliance with the 2016 proposal over a 20-year period. This investigation was performed as
part of the Food-PRICE (Food Policy Review and Intervention Cost-Effectiveness) project.
Methods
We used and extended the previously validated US IMPACT Food Policy Model [11,12] to
assess the potential health and economic effects of the proposed FDA voluntary sodium refor-
mulation policy over a 20-year period (2017 to 2036). We simulated 3 scenarios: (1) optimal,
with optimal implementation of the proposed FDA policy, assuming all processed foods will
be reformulated to the FDA proposed 2- and 10-year sodium targets; (2) modest, assuming
50% compliance with the proposed upper bound of the 2- and 10-year targets and 50%

 compliance with the main 2- and 10-year targets; and (3) pessimistic, assuming all processed
foods will be reformulated to the 2-year target but with no further reformulation.
We compared these 3 scenarios with a counterfactual “no intervention” (baseline) scenario.
For this, we assumed that the recent observed slow declining trends in sodium consumption
[13] will continue in the future. In addition, we modeled a very low compliance scenario, with
7.5% of applicable foods compliant with the 10-year reformulation targets, and present these
results in S1 Appendix (Extra Scenario; p. 28).
The US IMPACT Food Policy Model
Our extended US IMPACT Food Policy Model is a stochastic dynamic microsimulation
model that simulates the life course of synthetic individuals in a close-to-reality synthetic
population under different policy scenarios. Compared to previous versions of the model, it
allows for more detailed and flexible simulation of food policies in a competing risk frame-
work, taking into account population heterogeneity and lag times between exposures and
outcomes.
Specifically, the model first simulates the life courses of synthetic individuals aged 30
to 84 years under the “no intervention” scenario and records their sodium consumption,
systolic BP (SBP), first episode of CVD (coronary heart disease [CHD] or stroke), quality-
adjusted life years (QALYs), costs, and death from CVD or any other cause. Then it calcu-
lates the life courses of the same synthetic individuals under each of the 3 modeled sodium
reformulation scenarios (optimistic, modest, and pessimistic) and records the differences
in the aforementioned outcomes (Fig 1). Model data sources are outlined in Table 1.
We further describe the model inputs, structure, key assumptions, and outputs below.
Detailed description of the model, input sources, and key assumptions are detailed in

 Model inputs and structure
Demographics, sodium intake, and BP. The model synthesizes information regarding
population structure by age, sex, and race/ethnicity [14] and data from the 2 most recent
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) cycles (2011–2014) [13]
regarding sodium and SBP exposure, to prime a close-to-reality synthetic population. For this,
the model draws the traits of the synthetic individuals from conditional distributions that were
estimated from multinomial models fitted in the original survey data. The statistical frame-
work of this method and its extension to modeling have been described elsewhere [26,27], and
a detailed description and validation can be found in S1 Appendix. Then, the model projects
the recent observed trends in SBP and sodium intake into the future, and uses the projections
to evolve the traits of the synthetic individuals over time. We used NHANES 1999–2014 for
the SBP projections and NHANES 2009–2014 for the sodium intake projections [13]. The
inclusion of exposure trends in our analysis ensures more conservative estimates for the poten-
tial impact of the proposed FDA targets compared to an analysis assuming no trends.
CVD endpoints.
We used the CDC WONDER database [14] to extract mortality rates for
CHD (ICD-10: I20–I25), stroke (ICD-10: I60–I69), and any other cause for the years 1999–
2015, stratified by age, sex, and race/ethnicity. We forecasted these trends to 2036, again pro-
viding a more appropriate and conservative estimate of the potential impact of the proposed
FDA targets. Then, we used WHO DISMOD II to model the incidence and prevalence rates
for CHD and stroke for 2014 [28]. To account for future trends in CHD and stroke incidence
rates that are not attributable to SBP trends, we assumed that half of the forecasted annual
change in CHD and stroke mortality rates is due to changes in incidence rates. We based this
assumption on observational evidence from England and modeling studies in England and the
US [29–32], and we included this assumption in our probabilistic sensitivity analysis (see
below). Using a population attributable risk approach, the model calculates the annual risk of
the synthetic individuals developing CHD and stroke based on their SBP and incidence rate
forecasts using published relative risks. Finally, the model calibrates the annual case fatality for
CHD, stroke, and any other cause to the forecasted mortality rates in a competing risk frame-
work. Specifically, for “any other cause” mortality we assumed that hypertensive synthetic
individuals had higher mortality rates to account for diseases other than CHD and stroke that
we did not explicitly model but that are causally related to hypertension [18].
Summary of evidence regarding the risks of excess sodium consumption
Excess dietary sodium consumption has been linked to an increased risk of CVD [33]. For
CVD, the excess risk appears to be mainly mediated through the deleterious effect of excess

 sodium consumption on BP [2]. Our methods for evaluating the causality of effects of sodium
reduction on BP and of BP reduction on CVD have been previously described [2].
There is some controversy regarding the optimal level of sodium consumption [34]. Some
researchers claim that sodium consumption lower than 3,000 mg/day can actually increase the
risk of CVD and overall mortality [35,36]. However, it appears that this argument is based on
biased measurement methodology [37]. In a recent discussion on the subject, Mozaffarian
et al. concluded that the optimal level of sodium consumption, below which further sodium
reduction has no further health gains, is somewhere in the range of 614 mg/day to 2,391 mg/
day [2]. In our study we incorporated the uncertainty around the ideal sodium consumption
in our probabilistic sensitivity analysis.
Evidence that directly links sodium risk reversibility to CVD mortality or morbidity out-
comes is lacking. A meta-analysis of several randomized control trials that tested low-sodium
diets was underpowered and therefore inconclusive [38]. In comparison, a plethora of evi-
dence exists supporting the effect of a low-sodium diet on BP, which appears to happen within
weeks [2,39]. Finally, the cardiovascular risk reversibility of BP has been evident in several ran-
domized control trials and appears to occur within a 5-year period [40].
Policy effects
The FDA-proposed sodium reformulation policy included specific mean and upper bound
sodium concentration targets at 2 and 10 years for 155 food categories [9]. In addition, the
FDA also provided data to map these 155 food categories to the NHANES 2009–2010 24-hour
recall dietary questionnaire [41]. These data enabled the model to estimate the potential impact
of the modeled policies on every synthetic individual based on their age, sex, race/ethnicity,
and sodium consumption in the “no intervention” scenario. The model then used the esti-
mated reduction in sodium consumption of the synthetic individuals to calculate the effect
upon their SBP using a published meta-regression equation [2]. We assumed a gradual refor-
mulation of food products to targets, and immediate change in sodium intake in synthetic
individuals according to reformulation. We also assumed that the reformulated products
would sustain their sodium concentration thereafter. Although changes in sodium intake
influence SBP within weeks [2,39], we conservatively assumed a median duration of 5 years
from change in SBP to health outcomes.
Model outputs
For each scenario, the model generated the total numbers of relevant events and reported cases
and deaths prevented or postponed (CHD or stroke [CVD] or other), QALYs, life years
gained, and disaggregated disease costs. We present the results for US adults aged 30 to 84
years from 2017 to 2036 (simulation horizon of 20 years), rounded to 2 significant digits.
Medical costs and health state utility analysis
We calculated the health state utility values (preference weights) using published equations
[20] that used EQ-5D-3L data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) 2000–2002
[20]. The disease medical, mortality, and morbidity costs per person-year were derived from
an RTI International report that was based on MEPS [4]. We estimated informal care costs
using published data [21,22]. All costs were stratified by age, sex, and race/ethnicity except
informal care costs. The health state utility values were additionally stratified by income and
education.

 Policy costs
Policy costs included government costs to administer and monitor the policy as well as indus-
try costs incurred through reformulating products. By taking this societal perspective, we
aimed to understand the impact of sodium reduction on the entire US economy. Specifically,
for industry costs we used a reformulation cost model developed by RTI International under
contract with the FDA [25]. The model accounts for variations in product formula complexity,
company size, reformulation type, compliance period, and other factors, which produces a
more accurate cost estimate compared to a standard per-product cost approach. Administra-
tive costs were assumed to occur every year, with monitoring and evaluation costs occurring
every year after full policy implementation at year 3. We assumed the industry costs were
equal in the 2 rounds of reformulation (2- and 10-year targets) except for the pessimistic sce-
nario (which had no costs for the second round), and divided the costs over the policy imple-
mentation years (intervention years 1–3 for the first round, and intervention years 4–10 for
the second round). We assumed no policy costs after intervention year 10.
Cost-effectiveness analysis
To inform cost-effectiveness from different relevant perspectives, we evaluated both societal
and healthcare cost perspectives, closely adhering to the recommendations from the Second
Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine [42]. All costs were inflated to 2017 US
dollars using the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index and discounted at a 3%
annual rate. We also discounted QALYs at the same rate. We assumed a willingness to pay of
$100,000 per QALY [43].
Sensitivity and uncertainty analyses
We performed probabilistic sensitivity analysis via a second-order Monte Carlo approach that
allowed the estimated uncertainty of different model parameters and population heterogeneity
to be propagated to the outputs [44]. The sources of uncertainty we considered were the sam-
pling errors of baseline sodium intake, baseline SBP, and the relative risk of CHD and stroke
based on SBP; the uncertainties around the lowest sodium and SBP exposures below which no
risk is observed; the uncertainty around the effect of sodium on SBP; the uncertainty around
the true incidence of CHD and stroke; the uncertainty of mortality forecasts; the uncertainty
around which foods will be reformulated; the uncertainty around the quality of life decrements
used to calculate QALYs; and the uncertainty of all the costs. We summarize the output distri-
butions by reporting the medians and 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs). We also plotted the
annual probability that a scenario was cost-effective or cost-saving over the simulation period.
Finally, both discount rate and willingness to pay values were included in a 1-way sensitivity
analysis and allowed to vary in steps between 0% and 9% and between $50,000 and $150,000,
respectively. Please refer to S1 Appendix (specifically Tables D–F) for more information.
Results
Health-related outcomes
In the baseline scenario, median sodium consumption modestly declined from 3,150 mg/day
in 2017 to 2,974 mg/day in 2036. In the optimistic, modest, and pessimistic scenarios, sodium
consumption was projected to fall to 2,224 mg/day, 2,524 mg/day, and 2,789 mg/day, respec-
tively, in 2036 (Table 2; Fig 2). The resulting difference in median sodium consumption
between the optimal and pessimistic scenarios resulted in a 1.0-mm Hg difference in median

 SBP. These differences were larger in specific subgroups, for example older adults, those with
hypertension, and black individuals.
Optimal implementation, achieving the 2015–2020 US dietary guidelines national target of
<2,300 mg/day sodium consumption, could potentially prevent or postpone approximately 35,000
CVD deaths (95% UI: 3,700 to 78,000) and 450,000 cases of CVD from 2017 to 2036 (95% UI:
240,000 to 740,000), and potentially generate 2.1 million (95% UI: 1.7 million to 2.4 million) dis-
counted QALYs between 2017 and 2036 (61 QALYs per 100,000 person-years) (Table 3). The mod-
est and pessimistic scenarios might potentially prevent or postpone approximately half as many
(220,000) and a quarter as many (120,000) total cases, respectively. Both could still substantially
improve the health of the US population, with proportional findings for CVD deaths and QALYs.
The absolute health benefits from the optimistic scenario would be approximately 50%
greater among men than among women, reflecting men’s higher sodium intake and higher
CVD burden. The benefit would also be greater among non-Hispanic black individuals than
among non-Hispanic white individuals, reflecting the higher SBP, higher CVD burden, and
greater sensitivity to sodium changes of black individuals [18]. Finally, the largest number of
CVD cases would be prevented in the oldest age group (70–84 years), while middle-aged indi-

 net costs, a substantial saving over the 20-year period (Table 4; Fig 3). The pessimistic scenario
would still yield one-third of the savings, some $9.7 billion (95% UI: $5.9 billion to $16 billion).
From the societal perspective, the net savings from 2017 to 2036 would be even larger: an
approximately $41 billion (95% UI: $14 billion to $81 billion) reduction in net costs in the opti-
mal scenario. More than 95% of policy costs would be attributable to industry costs of refor-
mulation, with less than 5% attributable to government costs. The largest health-related cost
savings for all scenarios would be generated from hypertension medical and productivity
costs. The optimal scenario would yield more than 3 times more healthcare and societal sav-
ings per 100,000 person-years than the pessimistic scenario (Table 3).
All reformulation scenarios would be cost-effective, with the optimal and modest scenarios
being dominant, i.e., cost-saving and producing more health than the baseline case. The opti-
mal scenario would be approximately twice and 3 times as cost-effective as the modest and pes-
simistic scenarios, respectively (Fig 4; S1 Animation), generating a net monetary benefit of

were likely to be cost-saving by 2036 (99.9%, 99.0%, and 97.1% probability for optimal, modest,

Discussion
We used a microsimulation approach of a close-to-reality synthetic population (US IMPACT
Food Policy Model) to estimate the potential health and economic effects, over a 20-year
period, of the FDA’s proposed voluntary sodium reformulation targets under 3 scenarios of
differing compliance. Our study suggests that implementation of and full compliance with the
FDA voluntary sodium reformulation targets would result in substantial decreases in CVD
incidence and mortality whilst also offering impressive cost savings to the healthcare payers
and the wider economy. The optimal scenario saved the most lives and generated the most
QALYs and economic savings. However, even lower compliance, i.e., with just the 2-year tar-
gets or 50% of the 10-year targets, yielded health and cost savings. This finding highlights the
substantial health and economic opportunity costs of inaction or poorly sustained efforts to
reduce sodium consumption.
Suboptimal diet is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in the US and worldwide,
with excess sodium being a significant contributor [1]. The burden of hypertension continues
to grow despite advances in screening and evidence-based medications [45], emphasizing the
importance of population initiatives to reduce BP. Due to their well-documented effects on
BP, sodium reduction policies have been characterized as a “best buy” government interven-
tion by WHO. Despite this and many efforts, sodium remains overconsumed in the US,
highlighting the challenging nature of dietary behavior change. To date, the largest popula-
tion-wide reductions in sodium consumption have been achieved in Finland, Japan, and the
UK via comprehensive “upstream” strategies involving population-wide, multicomponent pol-
icies. In contrast, more “downstream” approaches such as individual approaches and worksite
or community interventions are much weaker [8], again demonstrating the effectiveness hier-
archy of public health interventions [46]. These declines in population sodium consumption
in Finland, Japan, and the UK have corresponded with expected reductions in population BP,
supporting our findings. In addition, long-term follow-up from the largest randomized control

 trials of sodium reduction demonstrated expected reductions in risk of CVD events [47].
Gradual sodium reduction achieves mean population sodium intake reductions without
noticeable changes to consumers and their palates [48–50]. This is unlikely to trigger compen-
satory behaviors resulting in additional sodium used by the consumer at the table or in cook-
ing [51–53]. Together with prior results, our investigation therefore supports the potential
health and economic benefits of implementing the proposed FDA voluntary sodium reformu-
lation targets.
When stratified by population subgroup, our results suggest the largest beneficial effects in
non-Hispanic black individuals, based on higher BP responsiveness and CVD mortality rates
[54]. These findings suggest additional benefits of the sodium reformulation targets in reduc-
ing disparities, consistent with previous evidence demonstrating that upstream population
interventions are more equitable than downstream, individual-focused strategies [55].
Our findings are consistent with previous analyses quantifying potential benefits of general
population reduction of sodium consumption [10,56–59] and build upon them significantly.
A previous modeling study estimated 194,000 to 392,000 QALYS gained annually in the US
with a reduction in salt consumption of 3 g/day [10], whilst another simulation study found
that 312,000 QALYs could be generated annually by reducing sodium consumption to the rec-
ommended upper bound of 2,300 mg/day [57]. These previous findings are reassuringly con-
sistent with our study, which projected an average 305,000 QALYs generated each year of the
study. However, our analysis includes several notable advances. For example, we evaluated and
incorporated background trends in sodium intake, SBP, and CVD, which reduces the esti-
mated potential benefits of our policy scenarios, providing the most conservative estimation of
benefits. In addition, we specifically modeled the 2016 FDA proposal, providing direct rele-
vance to current policy considerations in the US. Furthermore, we evaluated cost-effectiveness
from distinct relevant perspectives, including societal and healthcare perspectives. We are thus
able to provide policy makers and health advocacy groups with more accurate and timely real-
world estimations of the likely effects of the proposed policy, and the foregone opportunity
costs if the desired reformulations are not achieved. By including industry costs, the present
study aimed to include all relevant costs and provide objective results for all stakeholders.
This study has potential limitations. The effect estimates in the model are based on inter-
ventional and prospective observational studies. They are therefore subject to biases and con-
founding that may have influenced our model estimates. However, the etiological effects of
dietary changes were estimated from meta-analyses with confirmatory validity analyses,
including from randomized clinical trials. Our estimates may be conservative and underesti-
mate the full health and economic benefits of sodium reformulation, as (1) our baseline sce-
nario assumed that recent observed declines in sodium intake would continue into the future,
moderating the benefit of all reformulation scenarios; (2) we only evaluated diseases mediated
through BP, while decreasing sodium consumption could have beneficial effects upon other
health burdens such as gastric cancer [60,61]; and (3) reductions in sodium consumption
achieved through the proposed policy might additionally increase potassium intake though
substitution of NaCl with KCl [62], but we did not include this potential beneficial effect in
our model. We did not include unrelated medical costs in the main analysis or a sensitivity
analysis as this study focused only on costs for CVD. Our modeling results cannot replace evi-
dence from evaluating the actual policy intervention over time in the US, indicating that any
implementation of the FDA policy should be accompanied by robust independent assessment.
In conclusion, our findings suggest that the proposed FDA voluntary sodium reformulation
targets could result in substantial health benefits and cost savings across the US population.
However, suboptimal compliance or a delay in reaching these targets could result in a signifi-
cant number of preventable CVD cases, CVD deaths, and costs to the wider economy.
