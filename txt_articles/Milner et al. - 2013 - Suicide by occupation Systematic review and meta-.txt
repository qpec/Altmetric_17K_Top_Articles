 Numerous studies have found that certain occupations such as
medical professionals (including doctors, nurses, veterinarians),1–5
farmers6–8 and police9–11 are at elevated risk of suicide compared
with the general employed population. This could be explained by
access to lethal means through work, as in the case of farmers
reported to have taken their own life using firearms.12 Wider
socioeconomic determinants and work-related factors, including
exposure to stressful working conditions, could also influence
the relationship between occupation and suicide.13–17 A problem
common to many studies on this topic is that they are based on
limited sample sizes, hindering statistical power to detect small
effects. This article sought to examine the relationship between
occupation and suicide across the full evidence base through
systematic review and meta-analysis, thereby building on past
narrative reviews.18,19 In addition to offsetting statistical power
limitations common to single studies, the review sought to
investigate higher order patterning by occupational skill level or
status. This was made possible through the classification of
occupations according to a hierarchical internationally recognised
coding framework. The main hypothesis of this study was that risk
of suicide would vary by occupational skill level. The rationale for
this hypothesis stems from past research demonstrating that
psychosocial job stressors pattern by occupational skill level and
that psychosocial job stressors are associated with mental illness.20
Method
Search strategy
The review was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines
(www.prisma-statement.org/). The search strategy targeted studies
that reported information on suicide by occupation, published
from 1950 until May 2012. Computer-based internet databases
used for this search included: PubMed, Web of Science, Proquest
and Scopus. The combinations of keywords used in the database
search included: occupation* AND suicid*; work* AND suicid*;
job AND suicid*. The search was also run using terms such as
intentional self harm*. A secondary search examined the reference
list of all retained articles. Both published and unpublished
reports were considered in the review process. The initial data
searches were conducted by A.D.M. Subsequent data checking
and searches were overseen by M.J.S., J.P. and A.D.L, and
mismatches in classification of studies were resolved by consensus.
Eligibility criteria and selection of studies
Only studies that had the key search terms in the abstract and
suicidal behaviours as an outcome variable were considered.
Conceptual articles were excluded. Following this, only articles
that provided a clear assessment of occupation and that were in
English were included. Qualitative studies were removed, leaving
retrospective
population-level
studies,
case–control
studies,
meta-analyses and systematic reviews. Preference was given to
those studies able to provide information across representative
populations (for example coverage across entire occupational
groups), rather than smaller samples within specific populations.
Research on suicide mortality (i.e. no articles on suicide ideation
or attempts) was retained. All effect-size estimates were considered,
including odds ratios (ORs), rate ratios (RRs), relative risks,
proportionate mortality ratios (PMRs) and standardised mortality
ratios (SMRs). Estimates needed to present either a standard error
or 95% confidence intervals to be included in the meta-analysis.
Data extraction
Information extracted from each study included the location of
the study, time period the study was conducted, author names,

Suicide by occupation: systematic review
and meta-analysis
Allison Milner, Matthew J. Spittal, Jane Pirkis and Anthony D. LaMontagne
Background
Previous research has shown that those employed in certain
occupations, such as doctors and farmers, have an elevated
risk of suicide, yet little research has sought to synthesise
these findings across working-age populations.
Aims
To summarise published research in this area through
systematic review and meta-analysis.
Method
Random effects meta-analyses were used to calculate a
pooled risk of suicide across occupational skill-level groups.
Results
Thirty-four studies were included in the meta-analysis.
Elementary professions (e.g. labourers and cleaners) were
at elevated risk compared with the working-age population
(rate ratio (RR) = 1.84, 95% CI 1.46–2.33), followed by machine
operators and deck crew (RR = 1.78, 95% CI 1.22–2.60) and
agricultural workers (RR = 1.64, 95% CI 1.19–2.28). Results
suggested a stepwise gradient in risk, with the lowest skilled
occupations being at greater risk of suicide than the highest
skill-level group.
Conclusions
This is the first comprehensive meta-analytical review of
suicide and occupation. There is a need for future studies
to investigate explanations for the observed skill-level
differences, particularly in people employed in lower
skill-level groups.

Review article
 (version 2008).21 These were: category 1 (managers, senior
officials and legislators), category 2 (professionals), category 3
(technicians and associate professionals), category 4 (clerks),
category 5 (service and sales workers), category 6 (skilled
agricultural and fishery workers), category 7 (craft and related
trades workers), category 8 (plant and machine operators, and
assemblers), and category 9 (elementary occupations). Military
occupations were coded 0 because these are unable to be classified
according to skill level. Major groups were coded into four
aggregate levels of skill,22 from level 1 (the lowest skilled
occupations) to level 4 (the highest skilled occupations). Military
occupations were excluded from the aggregate skill level. Further
information about the coding of occupations included in this
review according to major ISCO grouping and aggregate skill level
can be found in online Table DS1.
Statistical analysis
All effect sizes and confidence intervals were log-transformed.
Where confidence intervals were unavailable, these were calculated
using the standard error of the effect size. To assess the effect of
occupational skill level on risk of suicide, separate random-effects
meta-analyses were conducted for each occupational subgroup
and skill level. The pooled subgroup results were presented on
the exponential scale. The pooled effect size represents the risk
of suicide among the subgroup of interest compared with the
whole working-age population. Heterogeneity between studies
was assessed through the I 2 statistic. Sensitivity analysis was
conducted to assess the impact of choosing different referent
groups or populations, as well as to examine differences between
males and females, and variation based on whether the study
controlled for socioeconomic status (SES). Meta-regression was
used to assess the extent to which statistical heterogeneity between
studies were related to one or more characteristics of the studies.23
Funnel plots were used to assess the precision of estimates.24 A
modified Egger’s test was used to assess small study effects by
performing a linear regression of the effect estimates on their
standard errors, weighted by 1/(variance of the intervention effect
estimate).25 All analyses were conducted using Stata 12.1 for
Windows using the ‘metan’ suite of commands.
Results
A total of 1290 articles were identified using the search terms
(Fig. 1). Initial scan of the title and abstract led to exclusion of
duplicates, editorial and conceptual pieces. Review of the abstracts
of the remaining 233 studies resulted in the exclusion of 45 case
series and qualitative articles, and 29 articles on suicide attempt
or ideation and mental illness (leaving only articles on suicide
mortality). Following this, 159 full-text articles were read for
inclusion. Review of all the reference lists of articles resulted in
21 additional articles being included from the reference lists of
all articles retrieved. At the last stage of review, 146 articles were
excluded because of incomplete reporting of either effects and/
or occupations, leaving 34 eligible studies.
Quality assessment
The quality of included studies was guided by past published
recommendations.26 Those deemed to be of acceptable quality
can be found in online Table DS2 (as mentioned above, the
grouping of occupations into the ISCO major (skill level) group
category and aggregate skill-level groups can be found in Table
DS1). Data used in all of the reviewed studies were based on
official objective accounts of both occupation and mortality (for
example standardised national coding of occupation, coronial
determined
causes
of
death).
There
were
four
nationally
representative retrospective cohort studies included in the meta-
analysis.27–30 These had reliable coverage (information from the
whole country) on both occupational information and mortality
from cases and controls across an entire population. However,
underreporting was generally not acknowledged or quantified
and may bias the results of these studies. Further, the retrospective
nature of the studies meant that information was drawn from past
exposures. This means that measurement may be incomplete or
relatively coarse, particularly when combined with the fact that
these studies were developed to examine a number of health
outcomes. Twelve studies were based on occupational-specific
cohorts that followed people over time.11,31–41 The populations
from which cases and controls were drawn in these studies are less
likely to be representative than those nationally representative studies
mentioned above. However, the completeness of recording of
mortality outcomes and exposures may be more accurate in these
studies because of their focus on health outcomes within specific
and defined occupational groups. There were 18 case–control studies
(information obtained from retrospective mortality databases)
included in the meta-analysis. In these studies, deceased exposed
(occupationally
coded)
individuals
were
compared
with
controls.8–10,42–56 Some of the studies included in this meta-analysis
adjusted for possible confounders such as SES,28,30,46,47,53–55 but
the majority did not. The highest quality studies were deemed
to be those based on nationally representative cohort studies that
were able to control for a range of possible confounders and had a
control population drawn from the general population.27–30
Characteristics of reviewed studies
Studies included in the review were conducted over a diverse
range of time periods and locations. The majority of research
on occupational suicide came from high-income areas of the
world such as Canada,29,31,47,56 the USA8–11,28,40,44,48,50,51,53–55,57

suicides.9,27,28,30,37,40,48,53,54 It was also possible for studies to
report more than occupation (Table DS2). For example, Agerbo
et al27 reported suicide mortality for 53 different occupational
groups, whereas Browning et al,8 reported suicide among farmers
in three different North American states. Jansson et al34 provided
suicide mortality for one occupational group (chimney sweeps).
Various effect measures were used. As detailed in Table DS2,
16 studies used rate ratios (RRs),8,9,11,27–30,32,36,38,42,43,45,48,51,56
11 used SMRs,31,33–35,37,39,41,47,49,50,52 3 used PMR measures9,40,44
and 4 studies used ORs.46,53–55 As suicide is a rare event in a
population, these measures of risk can be seen as comparable
for the purpose of meta-analysis.58 There were also a number of
different referent populations used in studies on occupational
suicide. One group of studies used an occupation at lower risk
of suicide as a referent.28,42,44,46,48,55 A second group compared
suicide in one occupational group to all other occupation
groups except that of interest.9,11,29,53,54 The last group included
studies that used the general working-age population as a
referent.8–11,29–45,47,49–52,56
Results by ISCO categories
Individual results conducted for each of the nine ISCO categories
can been seen in online Tables DS3–12, and Fig. 2 indicates the
pooled results. The pooled RRs were interpreted as the risk of
suicide in the category of interest compared with the working-
age population (further subgroup analyses were conducted to
assess the influence of different referent populations). The highest
risk of suicide was apparent in the ISCO major category 9, which
was comprised of ‘elementary’ occupations such as labourers and
cleaners (RR = 1.84, 95% CI 1.46–2.33) and the major category 8
group, which represented plant and machine operators and ship’s
deck crew (RR = 1.78, 95% CI 1.22–2.60). There was also a
particularly elevated risk among the ISCO major category 5
(RR = 1.52, 95% CI 1.28–1.80), which represented services such as
police, and ISCO major category 6 (RR = 1.64, 95% CI 1.19–2.28)
skilled agricultural, forestry and fishery workers. The lowest risk
of suicide was seen in the highest skill-level group of managers
(ISCO category 1, RR = 0.68, 95% CI 0.50–0.93) and clerical
support workers (ISCO category 4, RR = 0.77, 95% CI 0.64–0.92).
There was notable heterogeneity in sample size of each of the
ISCO categories, reflecting differential research attention to
certain occupations and skill levels. There were also notable
differences in the number of studies included in each subgroup
analysis, with ISCO 1 having only 8 studies (7 degrees of freedom),
whereas ISCO 9 consisted of 25 studies (24 degrees of freedom).
Results collapsed into four skill levels
There was no evidence of elevated suicide among skill levels 3 and
4 compared with the general working-age population. There did,
however, appear to be a decreasing gradient from the lowest
skilled occupations (skill level 1) to the second most skilled
occupation (skill level 3) (Fig. 3). The lowest (RR = 1.76, 95%
CI 1.42–2.17) and second lowest skilled occupations (RR = 1.32,
95% CI 1.19–1.47) had a higher risk of suicide than either the
highest (RR = 1.16, 95% CI 0.97–1.40) or second highest skilled
occupations (RR = 0.93, 95% CI 0.71–1.21).
Sensitivity analyses and meta-regression
A sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the effects of gender
on occupational risk of suicide, although statistical power was
limited by the reduced sample sizes (Table 1). Among males,
only one of the four skill-level groups (level 2) was significantly

different from an RR of 1.0. Risk was the highest in skill level 1
(i.e. the lowest skilled occupations) and decreased steadily to the
highest skilled groups. For females, conversely, the highest skill-
level group showed the highest RR; there was also, however, the
suggestion of a gradient for occupations classified into levels 1
to 3 (with the greatest risk being in those occupations at the lowest
skill level). The analysis for females was limited by a smaller
number of studies reporting female suicide.
Those studies that compared the risk of suicide with the
lowest-risk occupation generally showed stronger differences than
those that used the employed population overall, or all other
occupations (Table 1). These studies are better able to assess an
occupational skill-level gradient in suicide, as they compare results
to a distinct and often minimal risk occupational group.
A final sensitivity analysis was also conducted to assess
whether the relationship between occupational skill level and
risk of suicide was confounded by SES (Table 2). Contrary to
expectation, effect size estimates for each skill level were elevated
for studies with v. without SES adjustment (Table 2). This is likely
connected to the methodological characteristics of the studies that
adjusted for SES, which tended to be measured in relation to
another occupational group at lower risk of suicide rather than
the general population. Therefore, the increased risk may reflect
the underlying characteristics of the reference population rather
than the genuine influence of SES. In any case, limitations
notwithstanding, there was no evidence of confounding by SES.
Heterogeneity
Results of the meta-regression analysis showed that the use of
different referent groups explained about 16.7% of the between-
studies variance. The use of a lower risk occupation as a referent
group had a significantly greater effect on RR than the use of
the whole working-age population as a referent. Socioeconomic
status explained about 12.2% of the between-studies variance,
and those studies that controlled for SES had a significantly
greater risk of suicide by occupational skill-level group than those
that did not. There were no significant effects found for gender on
results. After controlling for gender and SES, results suggested that
the effects of different referent groups remained a significant
predictor of results. There were also differences in results based
on study design, with case–control studies being significantly
more likely to find greater effect sizes than either occupational
cohorts or general cohort studies. However, there was no statistical
difference related to the type of estimate used in the meta-analysis
(possibly related to the fact that all effect estimates were
transformed
to
be
made
comparable
before
analysis
was
conducted) or the location of the study. However, the year during
which the study took place was found to significantly influence
results, and accounted for 3.8% of between-study variance.
A funnel plot (online Fig. DS1) indicated that the majority of
studies had small standard errors and RR estimates spanning from
under one to approximately three. Observations with RR above
three had larger standard error estimates, which may reflect small
sample size or other limitations. The funnel plot also indicated
possible publication bias as most studies report positive effects
(i.e. occupations with greater risk of suicide than working
populations) rather than negative effects. There was a smaller
number of outlier studies with RRs above five and with standard
errors above 0.5 to 0.4. Further investigation of possible bias using
the modified Egger’s test25 indicated that small study effects were
evident in the results coded under ISCO major categories 1, 2, 4
and 5 (higher skill) but were not observable in those classified
under ISCO major categories 3, 6, 7, 8 or 9 (lower skill).
Discussion
Main findings
This study confirms that certain occupational groups are at
elevated risk of suicide compared with the general employed
population, or compared with other occupational groups. At
greatest risk were labourers, cleaners and elementary occupations
(ISCO major category 9), followed by machine operators and
ship’s deck crew (ISCO major group 8). It is notable that there
have been relatively few articles published on suicide in these
groups, despite people employed in these jobs having a markedly
higher burden of suicide than those in many other occupational
categories. Significantly elevated risk was also apparent in farmers
and agricultural workers (ISCO major group 6), service workers
such as police (ISCO major group 5) and people in skilled trades
(builders and electricians) (ISCO major group 7) compared with
working-age populations. The lowest rates were seen in managers
(ISCO major group 1) and clerical workers (ISCO major group 4).

 Suicide by occupation
Results of this meta-analysis also indicated significant differences
by skill level, with the lowest and the second lowest skilled
professions being at particularly elevated risk. The second most
skilled occupations had the lowest rates of suicide, but this was
not significantly different from the working-age population.
Possible explanations for our findings
The greater risk of suicide in lower skilled occupational groups
may be symptomatic of wider social and economic disadvantages,
including lower education, income and access to health services.59
This explanation has been noted in a recent paper by Roberts
et al 60 (unfortunately published after our analyses were completed
and so it was not included in the meta-analysis), which also found
that lower skilled occupations were at greatest risk of suicide in the
UK, and that variation in suicide rates that was explained by
occupational skill level increased significantly between 1979 and
2005. However, variation in SES disadvantage cannot explain
the elevated suicide rates among those employed in highly skilled
occupations, as these people are likely to be well paid and highly
educated (as suggested in past research).61 In saying this, a
limitation of this study is that it was unable to adequately assess
the role of socioeconomic factors due to differences in the
underlying methodological design of studies that did and did
not control for SES. Most studies that did control for SES used
another occupational group as a reference category (which led
to greater differences in RR estimates), whereas most of those that
did not control for SES used the entire working population as
reference (which led to smaller differences).
Access to lethal suicide methods through work may also
explain some of the observed results, particularly the higher risk
of suicide in ISCO categories containing farmers, police, military
and medical professionals than other occupations.18,19,62 An
investigation of the methods used in suicide by occupational
groups conducted in New Zealand52 found that farmers were
more likely to use firearms as a method to take their own life,
whereas health professionals were more likely to overdose on
drugs. However, those who died by suicide in the military did

not use firearms in this study, despite these being readily available.
This suggests that access to and familiarity with lethal suicide
methods underpin some, but certainly not all, occupational
suicides.
Alternatively, variations in suicide may reflect occupation-
specific factors. There has been some research suggesting that
the higher burden of suicide in agriculturally based occupations
is connected to exposure to pesticides (aside from the intentional
use of pesticides as a means of suicide).8,49,63 A cohort study by
Berlin et al64 found that people in occupations regularly exposed
to solvents and toxins (for example house painters, mechanics,
workers in the chemical-processing industry and printers) had
between 1.5 and 2 times the risk of suicide compared with the
general population. Explanations for these findings stem from
research showing that workers exposed to certain pesticides have
long-term neurological changes that may contribute to depressive
symptoms.65,66 The idea that pesticides increase the risk of suicide
in certain occupations has been called into question in recent
studies.67,68
One
possible
explanation
for
these
differences
between studies is that there may have been declining exposure
to chemicals over time. It is also possible that exposure is stronger
in some areas than others, which would suggest that the
geographical characteristics of studies is also important.
The quality of psychosocial working conditions may also
explain variation in suicide by occupation. Although there have
been only a few studies on the topic, those suggest an association
between psychosocial job stressors (for example low job control,
low social support, and high job demands) and suicide.13–17 A
study by Ostry et al17 found that psychological demands and social
support at work were associated with both completed and
attempted suicide in a cohort of sawmill workers. A cohort study
with 9-year follow-up in Japan found a fourfold increase in the risk
of suicide among men with low control at work.69 Psychosocial
job stressors have also been found to be associated with inter-
mediaries of suicide such as depression,70,71 and pattern by
occupational skill level.20 Considering this, it is plausible that
psychosocial job stressors have an influence on suicide mortality.
Finally, it is impossible to rule out the possibility that certain
occupations are at risk because of the underlying characteristics
of the individuals employed in them.5
Strengths and limitations
The main strengths of this paper lie in its classification of
occupations using a standardised coding framework. Not only
does this allow researchers the ability to compare like-occupations
across studies, it also enables the investigation of higher-order
patterning of occupation and suicide across the entire working
population. At the same time, there were several methodological
weaknesses. In some cases, available information on occupation
was insufficient for unambiguous skill-group level classification.
For example, those employed in the agricultural industry could
be defined as either ‘skilled agricultural forestry and fishery
workers’
(ISCO
major
category
6)
or
under
‘elementary
occupations’ (ISCO major category 9). Unless specified by the
article, occupations were classified under the first of these
categories, which would tend to reduce occupational skill-level
differences, biasing towards the null. Similarly, those employed
in the construction and building industry could be classified in
either ISCO major category 7 ‘craft and related trade workers’ or
under ISCO 9 major category ‘labourers in mining, construction,
manufacturing
and
transport’
. In this
case, classification
of
occupation was dependent on the amount of detail provided in
the source article. With respect to the assessment of occupational
skill-level differences, these problems were offset by collapsing of
occupational skill level from nine to four groups. Limitations in
the search strategy also may have meant that eligible studies
may have been excluded or screened out of the meta-analytical
review.
Another methodological weakness is that many studies on
occupational suicide use effect measures such as SMRs and PMRs,
which may obscure important effect modifiers such as SES. The
differences in referent groups between studies is also a problem
and there is noticeable variation between studies that used the
general working population or another occupational group as a
reference category (as seen in sensitivity analysis in Table 1).72
There may also be multiple comparisons between a control
group and several occupational groups within a single study. We
did not adjust for this as the only information available were
log-transformed effect sizes for categorical outcomes (OR, RR,
etc.) and their accompanying log standard errors/confidence
intervals. If these multiple comparisons did influence the meta-
analysis, we would expect results to be closer to null and produce
more
conservative
findings.
The
different
methodological
characteristics between those studies that did and did not control
for SES meant that we were unable to adequately assess the role of
wider social and economic inequalities on the relationship
between occupation and suicide.
There was also a large amount of heterogeneity between
studies, which is likely because of inherent differences in how
occupation was defined and classified, as well as connected to
variation in when the study was conducted, and the social and
geographical context of the study. At the same time, there were
clear similarities between studies grouped with the major
categories of ISCO 2008. This reflects the ongoing tension about
whether the primary objectives of meta-analytical studies should
be the estimation of an overall summary or average effect across
studies, or the identification and estimation of differences between
studies.58
Implications
Although the meta-analyses was subject to a high degree of hetero-
geneity as a result of variation in study designs, referent populations
and location of study, results indicate patterning in suicide
mortality by occupational skill-level group. Future research is
needed in order to validate these findings, and to investigate the
high level of heterogeneity between studies. From a public health
perspective, the results of this meta-analysis could suggest a need
to prioritise intervention and prevention efforts for people
employed in lower skilled jobs, particularly as these individuals
may have limited access to the economic, social and health
resources (as likely buffering or protective influences) available
to those in higher skilled occupations. A particularly important
(and understudied) area of work is the relationship between
exposure to psychosocial job stressors and suicide. It would also
be beneficial to understand the factors that protect some
occupational groups from suicide compared with the general
working population. Considering the workplace is increasingly
recognised as a venue to screen and effectively manage mental
health,73,74 further research and investment into workplace suicide
prevention efforts are necessary. Following best practice in
workplace mental health promotion,75 these interventions should
aim to address job stressors and other work-related influences,
while also building on factors that are protective against suicide
by promoting positive mental health and help-seeking.

Obsessive–compulsive disorder
Lynne Drummond
Obsessive–compulsive disorder is common, affecting up to 3% of adults and children. Obsessions are anxiogenic intrusive thoughts,
images or impulses. Compulsions are anxiolytic thoughts or behaviours which reduce the anxiety induced by obsessions. The relief of
anxiety reduction maintains the obsessive–compulsive cycle. Symptoms range from mild to life-threatening, where lack of personal
care can have potentially lethal consequences. A high proportion demonstrate suicidal behaviours. Most patients, irrespective of
symptom severity, respond to treatment with graded exposure or with serotonin reuptake inhibitors, but some continue with a
chronic or chronic relapsing course requiring ongoing psychiatric input and specialist interventions.
