 The State of US Health, 1990-2016
Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Among US States
The US Burden of Disease Collaborators
INTRODUCTION Several studies have measured health outcomes in the United States, but
none have provided a comprehensive assessment of patterns of health by state.
OBJECTIVE To use the results of the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) to report trends in
the burden of diseases, injuries, and risk factors at the state level from 1990 to 2016.
DESIGN AND SETTING A systematic analysis of published studies and available data sources
estimates the burden of disease by age, sex, geography, and year.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Prevalence, incidence, mortality, life expectancy, healthy
life expectancy (HALE), years of life lost (YLLs) due to premature mortality, years lived with
disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for 333 causes and 84 risk factors
with 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) were computed.
RESULTS Between 1990 and 2016, overall death rates in the United States declined from
745.2 (95% UI, 740.6 to 749.8) per 100 000 persons to 578.0 (95% UI, 569.4 to 587.1) per
100 000 persons. The probability of death among adults aged 20 to 55 years declined in 31
states and Washington, DC from 1990 to 2016. In 2016, Hawaii had the highest life
expectancy at birth (81.3 years) and Mississippi had the lowest (74.7 years), a 6.6-year
difference. Minnesota had the highest HALE at birth (70.3 years), and West Virginia had the
lowest (63.8 years), a 6.5-year difference. The leading causes of DALYs in the United States
for 1990 and 2016 were ischemic heart disease and lung cancer, while the third leading cause
in 1990 was low back pain, and the third leading cause in 2016 was chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease. Opioid use disorders moved from the 11th leading cause of DALYs in 1990
to the 7th leading cause in 2016, representing a 74.5% (95% UI, 42.8% to 93.9%) change.
In 2016, each of the following 6 risks individually accounted for more than 5% of
risk-attributable DALYs: tobacco consumption, high body mass index (BMI), poor diet, alcohol
and drug use, high fasting plasma glucose, and high blood pressure. Across all US states, the
top risk factors in terms of attributable DALYs were due to 1 of the 3 following causes: tobacco
consumption (32 states), high BMI (10 states), or alcohol and drug use (8 states).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE There are wide differences in the burden of disease at the
state level. Specific diseases and risk factors, such as drug use disorders, high BMI, poor diet,
high fasting plasma glucose level, and alcohol use disorders are increasing and warrant
increased attention. These data can be used to inform national health priorities for research,
clinical care, and policy.

revious studies have reported on health disparities
in US states and counties.1,2 These studies showed
that health disparities have increased with time.
Recent attention has focused on increased mortality in some
age groups and a decline in life expectancy.3 In addition,
the performance of the US health care system does not match
its level of spending on health and lags behind countries with
similar financial resources.4 For example, in 2014, US life
expectancy ranked 43rd in the world, although the United
States spent the most ($3.0 trillion) on health care, exceeding
the median amount spent by Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development countries by 35%.5
Several studies have shown large variations in risk factors

ferences in health outcomes.6-9 In the Global Burden of Disease

hensive as the GBD study.5,13-18 The GBD systematically ac-
counts for differences in data sources and biases and analyzes
levelsandtrendsforcausesandriskfactorswithinthesamecom-
putational framework, which maximizes comparability across
states, years, and different age groups by sex. GBD is now con-
ducted on an annual cycle, with GBD 2016 providing updated
estimates of mortality, morbidity, and risk factors in 195 loca-
tions, including the United States, from 1990 to 2016.
The findings of GBD 2016 indicate that while the United
States overall is experiencing improvements in health out-
comes, the patterns of health burden at the state level vary
across geography. Routinely monitoring the trend of burden
of disease at the state level is essential given the vital role of
states in many aspects of health and social policy19—from the
Medicaid program to regulation of private insurers20 and con-
sidering that individual states also experience different eco-
nomic circumstances. The current study uses GBD 2016 to re-
port the change in burden of disease, including injuries and
risk factors at the state level, from 1990 to 2016.
Methods
Overview
The GBD study is estimated annually and each round of results
is internally consistent (cause-specific mortality estimates are
summed to match all-cause mortality estimates) and collec-
tively exhaustive (residual categories [“other”] are captured to
enablequantifyingtotalburden)(Sections1-5inSupplement1).
ThenumbersreportedinthepreviousroundofGBDarenotiden-
tical to those of the current round (GBD 2016) for 2 main rea-
sons. First, since the GBD 2010 Special Communication regard-
ing US risk factors, there has been further refinement of the
“garbage coding” (ie, ill-defined causes of death) redistribution
methods (Supplement 1). Second, the new analysis at the state
level changes some of the estimation slightly when aggregated
to the national level. GBD 2016 provides a new time series.
The GBD 2016 methodology has been published pre-
viously.5,13-18GBDusesseveralmetricstoreportresultsforhealth

Data
To estimate the US burden of disease prevalence, computation
for each sequela began with a systematic analysis of published
studies and available data sources providing information on
prevalence,incidence,remission,andexcessmortality,suchas
theNationalHealthandNutritionExaminationSurveys,22state
inpatient databases,23 the National Ambulatory Medical Care
Survey,24NationalHospitalAmbulatoryMedicalCareSurvey,25

havioral Risk Factor Surveillance System,33 and the Centers for

Hospital inpatient data were extracted and used for this
analysis. Moreover, outpatient encounter data were available
for the United States through aggregate data derived from a
Key Points
Question How have the levels and trends of burden of diseases,
injuries, and risk factors in the United States changed from 1990 to
2016 by state?
Findings This study, involving examination of 333 causes and 84
risk factors, demonstrated that health in the United States
improved from 1990 to 2016, although the drivers of mortality and
morbidity have changed in some states, with specific risk factors
such as drug use disorders, high body mass index (BMI), and
alcohol use disorders being associated with adverse outcomes. In
5 states, the probability of death between ages 20 and 55 years
has increased more than 10% between 1990 and 2016.
Meaning Differences in health outcomes and drivers of morbidity
and mortality at the state level indicate the need for greater
investment in preventive and medical care across the life course.
The intersection of risk, mortality, and morbidity in particular
geographic areas needs to be further explored at the state level.

methodology applied several correction factors to account for
bias in health service encounter data from these claims that
were available as aggregated by International Classification of
Diseases (ICD) code and by primary diagnosis only. First, for

lence from primary diagnoses and prevalence from all diag-
noses associated with a claim. Second, the claims data were

All-Cause Mortality and Cause of Death
All-causemortalitywasestimatedbyage,sex,geography,andyear
using6modelingapproachestoassesscause-specificmortality;
the Cause of Death Ensemble Model was used to generate esti-
matesforthevastmajorityofcauses.Thisanalysisuseddeiden-
tified death records from the National Center for Health Statis-
tics(NCHS)35andpopulationcountsfromtheUSCensusBureau,36
NCHS, and the Human Mortality Database.37 Deaths and popu-
lationweretabulatedbycounty,agegroup,sex,year,and(inthe
caseofdeathdata)cause.ThecauselistdevelopedfortheGBD13
isarrangedhierarchicallyin4levels.Withineachlevel,thecause
list is designed such that all deaths are assigned exactly 1 cause.
As part of the GBD study, a map has been developed that allows
ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes to be translated to GBD causes.
Previous studies have documented the existence of insuf-
ficiently specific or implausible causes of death used in death
registration data that may lead to misleading geographic and
temporal patterns.38 Algorithms developed for the GBD were
used to reallocate deaths assigned one of these garbage codes
to plausible alternatives.39 First, plausible target causes were
assigned to each garbage code or group of garbage codes. Sec-
ond, deaths were reassigned to specified target codes accord-
ing to proportions derived in 1 of 4 ways: (1) published litera-
ture or expert opinion; (2) regression models; (3) according to
the proportions initially observed among targets; and (4) for
HIV/AIDS specifically, by comparison to years before HIV/
AIDS became widespread. More detail on each of these meth-
ods is provided in Section 2 of Supplement 1.
Based on standard GBD methods, YLLs were computed by
multiplying the number of deaths from each cause in each age
group by the reference life expectancy at the mean of age of
death among those who died in the age group. The YLLs com-
putation is based on the precedent set by GBD and uses the
samelifetablestandardforcalculatingYLLsinalllocationsand
years (essential for comparing estimates of YLLs across loca-
tions and years). The standard is meant to represent the mor-
tality experience of a population with minimal excess mortal-
ity using the lowest observed age-specific mortality rates in
2016 among all countries with a population greater than 5 mil-
lion. This standard does not vary with time because for most
populations, the number of YLLs (once normalized for popu-
lation size) is larger in earlier years than in later years due to
improvingsurvivalratherthananartifactofthestandardused.
Analysis of Incidence, Prevalence, and YLDs
In this study, incidence and prevalence of diseases by age, sex,
cause, year, and geography were estimated using a wide range
of updated and standardized analytical procedures. GBD used
DisMod-MR, a Bayesian meta-regression tool, to determine
prevalence and incidence by cause and sequelae.40
Data sources used for quantifying nonfatal outcomes are
available online in the GBD results tool41 and in Section 3 of
Supplement 1. Prevalence of each sequela was multiplied by
the disability weight for the corresponding health state to cal-
culate YLDs for the sequela. The sum of all YLDs for relevant
sequelae equated to overall YLDs for each disease. Details on
disability weights for GBD 2016, including data collection and
disability weight construction, are described elsewhere.14
Analysis of DALYs and HALE
FollowingGBD2016methods,nationalandstate-levelDALYswere
computed by summing YLLs and YLDs for each cause, age, and
sex in 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2016 (Section 4 in
Supplement 1). DALYs were computed for 333 causes, with 95%
uncertaintyintervals(UIs)capturingtheuncertaintyforbothYLL
and YLD rates. HALE was calculated using the Sullivan method
andgenerated95%UIsthatindicateduncertaintyforage-specific

timated YLDs per capita; additional details on HALE methodol-
ogy are provided in Section 4 in Supplement 1.
Risk Factors
GBD 2016 used the comparative risk assessment framework to
estimate attributable deaths, DALYs, and trends in exposure by
agegroup,sex,year,andgeographyforrisksfrom1990to2016.
GBD has 84 behavioral, environmental and occupational, and
metabolic risks or clusters of risks (Section 5 in Supplement 1).

Healthy life expectancy: the number of years that a person at
a given age can expect to live in good health, taking into account
mortality and disability.
Summary Exposure Value: the relative risk–weighted prevalence of
exposure (developed for Global Burden of Diseases Study 2015).
Years lived with disability: computed as the prevalence of different
disease sequelae and injury sequelae multiplied by disability weights
for that sequela. Disability weights are selected on the basis of
surveys of the general population about the health loss associated
with the health state related to the disease sequela.
Years of life lost due to premature mortality: computed by
multiplying the number of deaths at each age by a standard life
expectancy at that age. The standard selected represents the
normative goal for survival and has been computed based on
the lowest recorded death rates across countries in 2010.

posure value is reported on a scale from 0% to 100% to em-
phasize that it is risk-weighted prevalence.
To calculate risk-attributable fractions of disease burden
by cause, the effects of risk exposure levels were modeled, RRs
associated with risk exposure and specific health outcomes
were documented, and counterfactual levels of risk exposure
on estimates of national and state-level deaths, YLLs, YLDs,
and DALYs were computed. Detailed descriptions of the GBD
2016 methods for risk factor assessment and attribution are

US DALYs
Figure 1 shows the 25 leading causes of DALYs in 1990 and 2016
with their mean percentage change during the period. IHD and
lung cancer were the leading causes of DALYs in both years, but
the age-standardized rate declined between 1990 and 2016 by
49.7%forIHDandby32.5%forlungcancer.Theage-standardized
DALY rate for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (the third
leadingcausein2016)increasedby5.5%between1990and2016,
and for diabetes (the fourth leading cause in 2016), it increased
by11%.Diabetesincreasedfromthesixthleadingcausein1990

talcancer(by27.4%).FourleadingcausesofDALYShadincreases

ders (by 47.9%), chronic kidney disease (by 44.3%), self-harm
by other means (by 20.3%), and falls (by 19.0%).
US Risk Factor Estimates

from 17 risk factors in 2016. Diet, tobacco use, and high systolic
bloodpressureweretheleadingcausesofdeathswhiletobacco
use,highbodymassindex,anddietweretheleadingriskfactors
for DALYs. For example, dietary risks accounted for 529 299
deaths in 2016, with 83.9% of these deaths due to cardiovascu-
lar diseases, and the remainder due to a combination of neo-
plasmsanddiabetes,andtourogenital,blood,andendocrinedis-
eases. Alcohol and drug use were the eighth leading cause of
deathandthefourthleadingcauseofDALYs.In2016,eachofthe
6followingrisksaccountedformorethan5%ofDALYs:tobacco
consumption,highbodymassindex,diet,alcoholanddruguse,
high fasting plasma glucose levels, and high blood pressure.
Attribution of DALYs to Risk Factors
In 2016, 44.9% of total DALYs in the United States were attrib-
utable to risk factors. Behavioral risk factors accounted for the
largest percentage of the attributable fraction of DALYs due to
all causes (43.5%), followed by metabolic (22.7%), and envi-
ronmental and occupational risks (3.7%) (Supplement 2).
Individual State Data
GBD 2016 showed substantial variations in the burden of dis-
eases, injuries, and risk factors by state. There was also a varia-
tion in trends by age, sex, and state (key findings and results
of burden by state in Supplement 3).

 declined in all states. The most pronounced declines were in
South Carolina, Georgia, Alaska, and New York, at higher than
a0.85-pointdecreaseinprobability(Figure3).Incontrast,Maine
had the lowest decline of 0.32-point probability. In the United
States as a whole, there was a decline of 0.70, which was asso-
ciatedwithneonataldisorders,othernoncommunicablediseases
(includingcongenital),andalargecontributionfrominjuries,with
slight increases from mental and substance use disorders
(Figure 3).
The largest reductions in probability of death for ages 20 to
55yearswereobservedinNewYork(3.5)andCalifornia(2.5)and
the highest increases were observed in West Virginia (2.6) and
Oklahoma (2.0) (Figure 4). In 21 states, the probability of death
has actually increased from 1990 to 2016, but of these, only 5
showed an increase of greater than 10% (Kentucky, Oklahoma,
NewMexico,WestVirginia,andWyoming).Conversely,31states
and Washington, DC have seen decreases in the probability of
deathamongadultsaged20to55yearsoverthesameperiod,but
onlyin15stateswasthatdecreasemorethan10%(NewYork,Cali-
fornia,Illinois,NewJersey,Georgia,Maryland,Florida,Nevada,
Texas, Virginia, Connecticut, North Carolina, Massachusetts,
Washington, South Carolina). Decreases in the probability of
deathinUSstateswereinfluencedbydeclinesinHIV/AIDSacross
allstategroups,aswellasdeclinesinroadinjuriesandneoplasms,
while increases in probability of death were influenced by in-
creasedburdenofdrugusedisorders,alcoholusedisorders,and
chronic kidney disease, among others (Figure 4).
All states experienced a considerable reduction in prob-
abilities of death for ages 55 to 90 years, largely associated with
reductions in the probability of dying from cardiovascular dis-
eases(Figure5).ThehighestpointdeclinewasobservedinCali-
forniaat12.6points,comparedwithlowestdeclineof3.5points
for Mississippi. These declines were somewhat offset by in-
creases in the death rates associated with cirrhosis and other
liver disease, neurological disorders, and mental and sub-
stance use disorders in all states. Hawaii was the only state in
which the probability of death was less than 65% for ages 55
to 90 years. Other notable findings include the variation in the
decline of probability of death between the 3 age groups, with
an 8.3-point decline of probability of death for ages 55 to 90
years, a 1-point decline for ages 20 to 55 years, and a 0.7-point
decline for ages 0 to 20 years.
YLLs Overall, by State, and for Washington, DC
The age-standardized YLL rates for the United States, all states,
and Washington, DC in 2016 for the top 20 causes are grouped
by 3 levels of significance (Figure 6) indicating significantly be-
lowthemean,indistinguishablefromthemean,andsignificantly

Kentucky, Tennessee, South Carolina, Indiana, Missouri, and
Ohio had YLLs significantly higher than the mean with a few
exceptions of causes that were indistinguishable from the
mean. Other notable findings were that Louisiana had YLLs for

 Observed to Expected YLLs Overall, by State, and for Washington, DC
The ratio of observed YLLs to those expected, based on the SDI
for the 10 leading causes of YLLs for the United States overall,
each individual state, and Washington, DC, are shown in
Figure 7. For example, in Alabama, the stroke ratio was 1, indi-
cating that the observed rates are similar to what would be ex-
pectedgiventhestate’
sSDI,whereasdiabetesisobservedat2.85
times more than expected. For the United States overall, the ra-
tios of observed YLLs to those expected were 0.75 for IHD, 1.11
for lung cancer, 1.88 for chronic obstructive pulmonary dis-
ease, 0.61 for stroke, 1.19 for road injury, 1.14 for Alzheimer dis-
ease, 0.98 for self-harm, 7.17 for drugs, 0.84 for colorectal can-
cer,and1.27forlowerrespiratorytractinfection.Ingeneral,most
statesperformedbetteronIHDandstrokebutworseforchronic
obstructive pulmonary disease and drug use disorders. Colo-
rado had the best performance for IHD at 0.58 observed to ex-
pected ratio of YLLs, while West Virginia had the highest ob-
served to expected ratio of YLLs for drug use disorders at 14.38.
Other notable findings are the high rates in Washington, DC for
interpersonal violence, drug use disorders, HIV/AIDS, and
chronickidneydisease,giventhatWashington,DChasthehigh-
est SDI rank in the US and in the world.

Changes in Age-Standardized Summary Exposure Values

ues for the top 10 risk factors from 1990 to 2016 are shown in
Table7.Highfastingplasmaglucoseincreasedby76%andhigh
bodymassindexby53.2%,whilesmokingdeclinedby42.8%dur-
ing the same time period in the United States. There were clear
patterns in these variations by states. High fasting plasma glu-
cose increased in all states; the increase ranged from 127.2% in
Mississippi to 1.7% in Pennsylvania. Drug use increased in all
states except Arkansas, Maryland, and Oregon. Other notable
findingsincludereductionsinhighsystolicbloodpressure,high
totalcholesterollevels,anddietlowinwholegrainsinallstates.
Leading Risk Factors for DALYs by State and for Washington, DC
The rank of risk factors by state in 2016 are shown in Figure 10.
Tobacco smoking was the leading risk factor for DALYs in the
United States and in 33 states. Alcohol and drug use were the
leading risk for DALYs for 7 states and Washington, DC, while
high BMI was the leading cause for 10 states (California, Con-
necticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, New York,
North Dakota, Texas, and Virginia). Another notable finding
is that diet was the third leading cause of DALYs in the United
States overall but the second in 20 states.
Discussion
This study provides a comprehensive report on the burden of
disease and its patterns in the United States and the individual
50 states from 1990 to 2016 and reveals wide disparities in bur-
den of disease at the state level. Moreover, these findings show
distinct trends in different age bands and demonstrate that im-
provement in some health outcomes, such as IHD, lung can-
cer, and neonatal preterm complications, are balanced by ris-
ing death rates from drug use disorders, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, self-harm, chronic kidney disease, cirrho-
sis, and hypertensive heart disease. Summary measures, such
as life expectancy, that do not differentiate the trends in differ-
entagegroupsmasktheheterogeneousdirectionsforUShealth
status by age and state. Above and beyond the drivers of diver-
gent trends, the study reveals that there has been far greater
progress in reducing the burden of some major causes of YLLs,
suchasIHDandlungcancer,butnoprogressinaddressingsome
of the leading causes of YLDs such as mental health disorders
and musculoskeletal disorders. These findings should be used
to examine the causes of health variations and to plan, de-
velop, and implement programs and policies to improve health
overall and eliminate disparities in the United States.
Mortalityreversalsin21statesforadultsages20to55years
arestronglylinkedtotheburdenofsubstanceusedisorders,cir-
rhosis, and self-harm, and this study shows that the trends for
some of these conditions differ considerably across different
states. Case and Deaton have called some of these conditions
“deathsofdespair”andarguedthattheyarelinkedtothesocial
and economic status of white US adults.3 A wide range of inter-
ventionshavebeenproposedtoaddresssubstanceabuse,cirrho-
sis, and self-harm. For substance abuse,28,47-49 prevention pro-
grams should account for the root causes of substance use, the
socioeconomic factors involved, and causes of relapses during
treatment.50,51 Physicianshaveamajorroletoplayinaddiction

2 risk factors pose unique challenges in the United States given
thatunabated,theyhavethepotentialtochangethehealthtra-
jectoryforindividualsinmanystates.Levelsofoverweightand
obesity increased during the study period. US residents need
to do more to maintain their weight or reduce it, when needed,
as well as access systems to support these intentions.57 Al-
thoughphysicalactivityincreasedduringthestudyperiod,the
levels of increase were not enough to control weight gain.8
Physical inactivity is a risk factor for many diseases, but in-
creasing activity is not enough on its own to reduce weight or
preventweightgain.58Obesityisassociatedwithincreaseddia-
betes, cardiovascular diseases, some neoplasms, and poor
health-related quality of life. This study calls for renewed ef-
forts to control weight gain at the community level.
Several studies have reported on the effect of taxes on sug-
ary drinks or subsidies to encourage consumption of healthy
foods, although only a small fraction of obesity can be linked
to sugar-sweetened beverages.59 A comprehensive plan is
needed to address obesity because it adversely affects health
anddrivesuseofhealthcareresources.4,60-62RisingBMIisdriv-
ing up fasting plasma glucose levels and diabetes, and diabe-
tes increased as a cause of burden in almost all states during
the study period. Diabetes is a costly disease that consumes
approximately 4.82% of the US health care budget.4 A recent
studyestimatedthatthecostofdiabetescareincreasedby6.1%
from 1996 to 2013.4 Diabetes is associated with many condi-
tions and disabilities.63 This rise in burden and its cost is note-
worthy given the projected increase in diabetes as obesity in-
creases in the United States.
This study shows that there were reductions in the death
ratesfromcardiovasculardiseasesforallagegroups.Thisprog-
resshasbeen,inpart,influencedbyreductionsinsystolicblood
pressure and cholesterol, but the role of increased access to ef-
fective treatment has also been considerable.64 In fact, age-
standardizedCVDdeathrateshavedecreasedintheUnitedStates
by32.8%overthelast20years.Theimportantroleoftreatment
inreducingdeathrateshighlightstheongoingimportanceofen-
suring financial and physical access to care and the importance
of quality of care. As declines in the rate of CVD may be slowing
down,adversetrendsduetothediseasesofdespairandadverse
risktrendsmaymeanthathistoricalprogressinimprovedlifeex-
pectancy may not continue in the future.
Thestrategiesfordealingwiththeremaininginequalitiesand
new threats are 3-fold: (1) address some of the key modifiable
risks,includingdiet;tobacco,alcohol,anddruguse;insufficient
physical activity; and obesity; (2) improve access to and, more
importantly,qualityofcareinkeyareas,suchaschronickidney
diseaseandongoingcareforsubstanceusedisorders;and(3)ad-
dress the social determinants of health. We have previously
shownanassociationbetweensocioeconomicandrace/ethnicity
factors and a 60% county-level variation in life expectancy, be-
havioral and metabolic risk factors and a 74% variation, and
health care factors and a 27% variation.65 Combined, these fac-
torsareassociatedwith74%ofoverallvariation.Wealsoreported
that most of the association between socioeconomic and race/
ethnicityfactorsandlifeexpectancywasmediatedthroughbe-
havioral and metabolic risk factors. Research has shown that
some environmental factors have an effect on risk factors such
asobesityandlowphysicalactivity.Lowsocioeconomicsettings
oftenhaveanimbalanceoffewgrocerystoresandnumerousfast
food options, and access to safe outdoor places spaces for rec-
reation is limited.66,67
To date, the strategies for addressing the social determi-
nants of health in the United States have been elusive. Lack
of progress and rising social inequalities should not engender
complacency. Therefore, addressing risk factors may prove to
beanimportantopportunitytoreducedisparitiesanddealwith
some of the challenges for improving US health. Opportuni-
ties to decrease the burden of disease through reducing to-
bacco, alcohol, drug use, blood pressure, and cholesterol; in-
creasing physical activity; and improving diet emphasize that
the United States should invest more in prevention that tar-
getstheserisks.Toincreasethelikelihoodofpreventiontosuc-
ceed, it has to be a priority for all stakeholders—physicians,
nurses,hospitalsystems,policymakers,healthinsurancecom-
panies, patients and their families, and advocacy groups.
This study showed a wide range of challenges encountered
bydifferentstatesandbysomecountieswithinstates.Giventhe
diversityofrisks,communities,andworkplacesthereisnosimple
menuofeffectiveprogramsforriskreduction.Indeed,localex-
perimentation to determine what works in a given community
is likely to be necessary. There is a need to change strategies of
fundingandevaluationofinnovativeinterventionsandpolicies,
andindependentevaluationofwhethertheseeffortsworkornot
shouldbedocumented.Tosucceed,theseinnovativeprograms
should forge a connection between health care provision and
progress for individuals and communities in health outcomes.
The notion of accountability should be broadened beyond pro-
vidinghigh-qualitycaretoencompassachievingriskreduction
in partnership with patients and communities.
The interpersonal violence burden in the United States has
to be properly addressed, although declines have been ob-
served:theage-standardizeddeathratedecreased32.43%from
1990 to 2016 in the United States. However, self-harm by fire-
arm accounted for 6.39 deaths per 100 000 persons in the
United States in 2016, and physical violence by firearm ac-
counted for 3.98 deaths per 100 000 persons. There is evi-
dence that gun control achieved through background checks
reduces homicide and suicide.68-72 Previous studies reported
success in reducing the burden of gun deaths through policy
changes in Brazil and other countries.71 Indeed, enforcing gun
control policies has proven effective in reducing mortality in
a variety of contexts. There is a need for comprehensive stud-
ies of the epidemiology of gun violence in the United States
to inform the ongoing gun control debate.
Age-standardized death rates due to alcohol increased by
17.50% from 1990 to 2016 in the United States, and alcohol use

 while intoxicated. Programs to educate US residents about the
true harms of excessive drinking are needed.
Many of the risk factors that contribute to the disparities
in burden are amenable to medical treatment within the con-
text of supportive behavioral and lifestyle changes. For ex-
ample, many cardiovascular risk factors, such as high blood
pressure and high cholesterol levels, can now be treated more
effectively with early detection and proper follow-up. Safe, ef-
fective, and affordable antihypertensive medications are now
widely available, often as generic preparations, especially at
discount pharmacies, and in many cases, without the need for
health insurance for medications. The Affordable Care Act
(ACA) allows for the expansion of insurance coverage, which
ultimately increases access to care. Indeed, the ACA expan-
sion of Medicaid coverage in participating states to all nonel-
derly adults with incomes below 133% of the federal poverty
level provides an opportunity for early detection and fol-
low-up of some of the main health risk factors. However, many
US residents do not have health insurance, even after the ACA
was introduced, and hence have little access to medical diag-
nosis and treatment. Therefore, expanding health coverage for
certain conditions and medications should be considered and
adopted to reduce burden.
This study showed that the United States overall and many
individual states have made progress in reducing mortality but
have had limited success in reducing disability. For instance,
the burden of drug use disorders in total DALYs increased in
the United States during the study period by 61.4% and ac-
counted for about 3.81 million DALYs in 2016, depressive dis-
orders increased 17.32% and accounted for 2.72 million DALYs,
and anxiety disorders increased by 16.7% and accounted for
approximately1.76millionDALYsin2016.Thesefindingspoint
to an urgent need to address mental health and drug use dis-
orders in the United States. There is a need for improved ac-
cess to quality mental health care and screening to improve
outcomes, as well as programs to prevent mental disorders and
promote mental health.
As the US population ages, the burden of musculoskel-
etal disorders will increase. More US residents have neck and
back pain, and the incidence of falls is increasing. Musculo-
skeletaldisordersareassociatedwithahighmedicalcost.4Pre-
ventive measures to reduce the burden of these risk factors in
all stages of life are urgently needed. Programs for avoiding
harm and injuries at work among both younger and older ages
are needed. The programs should include prevention of falls
in the older population through examining the risk factors that
lead to falls among adults. Screening tools and interventions
to address this burden should be implemented.
TheresultsofGBD2016haveshownthatoccupationalrisks
and air pollution were the 9th and 10th leading causes for
DALYs. Although the findings show reductions in attribut-
able burden from 1990 to 2016, occupational risks still ac-
count for 948.75 DALYS per 100 000 persons, and air pollu-
tion accounts for 584.97 DALYs per 100 000 persons—large
numbers in the United States. Indeed, renewed efforts to re-
duce the burden of environmental and occupational risks are
needed to ensure continued progress in reducing their effect
on health in the United States.
Several studies have shown that poor diet is a major chal-
lenge in the United States, and little improvement has oc-
curred over the past decades. US residents are not consuming
a healthy diet; they tend to consume more calories than
needed, and composition is not ideal.49,62 Some recent stud-
ies have shown modest improvement in certain aspects of US
diet,especiallydecreasesinconsumptionofsugarydrinks.The
United States needs a comprehensive program to improve di-
etary intake at national and local levels. This program should
offer financial incentives and disincentives for more vs less
healthful food products by agriculture producers, food manu-
facturers, and retailers, as well as for choices by consumers.
Thiseffortshouldalsoimplementcomprehensivewellnesspro-
grams in schools, workplaces, and government offices, and in-
form the public of the importance of a healthful diet.
Limitations
Given the scope of this analysis, this study has several impor-
tant limitations. The overall limitations of the GBD methods,
as noted in other publications, apply to the US analysis. First,
theaccuracyoftheestimatesdependsontheavailabilityofdata
by time period and state. Second, it is challenging to separate
measurement error from variation in disease occurrence. GBD
corrects for known bias from nonreference methods or case
definitions,butoftenhastorelyonsparsedataatthestatelevel
to make those adjustments. Third, GBD applies garbage code
redistribution for 13% of causes of deaths in the United States;
this ranged from 8.4% in South Dakota to 21.3% in Alabama.
Therefore, the causes of death may not match those in other
publications but are more robust because they control for the
between-states variation in the prevalence of garbage codes.
Fourth, GBD methods adjust for hospital admissions using a
largenonrepresentativesourceofmedicalclaimsdata.Thegen-
eralizability of claims data, the use of primary diagnosis only
or all diagnostic fields, and the trends of claims data have been
questioned.13 Also, there may be considerable interstate varia-
tion in how diseases are treated between inpatient and out-
patient settings. GBD methods adjust for such potential bi-
asesbyusingacovariateonclaimsandhospitaladmissionsdata
to correct for systematic error. Fifth, GBD includes risk-

 Conclusions
There are wide differences in the burden of disease at the
state level. Specific diseases and risk factors, such as drug
use disorders, high BMI, poor diet, high fasting plasma
glucose level, and alcohol use disorders are increasing and
warrant increased attention. These data can be used to
inform national health priorities for research, clinical care,
and policy.
