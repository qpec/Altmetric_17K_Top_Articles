ABSTRACT: The development of novel neuroprotective treatments for acute stroke has been fraught with failures,
which supports the view of ischemic brain damage as a highly complex multifactorial process. Post-translational
modifications such as small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)ylation have emerged as critical molecular regulatory
mechanisms in states of both homeostasis and ischemic stress, as evidenced by our previous work. Accordingly, the
clinical significance of the selective control of the global SUMOylation process has become apparent in studies of
ischemic pathobiology and pathophysiology. Herein, we describe a process capable of identifying and character-
izing small molecules with the potential of targeting the SUMO system through inhibition of SUMO deconjugation
in an effort to develop novel stroke therapies.—Bernstock, J. D., Ye, D., Smith, J. A., Lee, Y.-J., Gessler, F. A., Yasgar,

Cerebrovascular accidents continue to be a leading cause
of both morbidity and mortality worldwide, posing an
increasingly severe burden on society (1). Despite the
many basic and translational studies and clinical trials
(2, 3), therapeutic approaches to modulating the evolving
pathobiologyofischemicstrokebeyondacutethrombolysis
and mechanical thrombectomy have not found their way
into treatment strategies (4–6). The limited success of such
massive research investments demands a reevaluation of
the underlying pathobiology in an effort to identify novel
therapeutic targets and translational approaches.
The pathology of stroke is complex and involves
many cellular processes. Ischemic stroke, most often
caused by a thromboembolism that occludes a cerebral
artery, can lead to focal brain ischemia, cell death, and,
ultimately, sensory, motor, and cognitive impair-
ments (7). Treatments targeting neuroprotection and
intending to prevent salvageable neurons from dying
have uniformly failed in clinical trials despite showing
efficacy in experimental stroke studies (8, 9). Fur-
thermore, no treatment or combination of treatments
yet explored have been able to address the entirety of
damaging processes that occur during or after is-
chemic stroke (e.g., excitotoxicity, inflammation, and
apoptosis) (7, 9).
The complexity of ischemic stroke demands therapies
that simultaneously engage multiple axes involved in the

 pathobiology and pathophysiology of ischemia (2, 10).
Accordingly, a body of evidence has arisen to support that
small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)ylation, a dynamic
post-translational modification, may be a relevant
therapeutic target in ischemic stroke (11, 12). Protein
SUMOylation has been documented to play a role in
numerous homeostatic processes throughout the cell,
including signal transduction, chromatin remodeling,
gene expression, and protein quality control (13–15). In
brief, SUMO in mammals is found as 4 distinct system-
ically distributed paralogues: SUMO-2 and -3, sharing
96% homology; SUMO-1, sharing only 45% homology
with SUMO-2 and -3; and the recently identified but ill-
characterized SUMO-4, sharing 86% homology with
SUMO-2 (16, 17). Like its namesake ubiquitin, SUMO is
synthesized as an inactive precursor that is maturated by
the endopeptidase activity of SUMO-specific proteases
(SENPs) to expose a C-terminal di-glycine (GG) motif
(14). Conjugation begins when the heterodimeric E1
enzyme
(SUMO-activating
enzyme-1/2)
adenylates
SUMO in an ATP-dependent process to form a covalent
thioester E1-SUMO intermediate, which is then trans-
ferred to the catalytic cysteine of Ubc9, the sole E2
conjugase. Ubc9, often with the assistance of a target-
specific E3 ligase, catalyzes the formation of an isopep-
tide linkage between the C-terminal GG motif of SUMO
and the e-amino-group lysine of the target substrate
(14, 15). The consequences of SUMO conjugation include
the modulation of protein interactions (e.g., providing
SUMO interacting motifs), alterations in target pro-
tein stability (e.g., recruiting SUMO-targeted ubiquitin
ligases or hindering ubiquitin conjugation), and regula-
tion of activity (e.g., inducing changes in protein con-
formation) (13, 15).
Based on a substantial body of evidence, it is now be-
lieved that SUMOylation is an endogenous neuro-
protective mechanism (12, 18–27). For example, in vitro
studies have shown that silencing SUMOs sensitizes pri-
mary neurons to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)-
induced damage, whereas overexpression of SUMO in
cortical neurons induced OGD tolerance (12). Further-
more, compared to wild-type mice, mice overexpress-
ing Ubc9 demonstrated improved resistance to focal
ischemia–induced damage (23), and transgenic mice in
which SUMO-1–3 were knocked down in neurons dis-
played worse functional outcomes after transient fore-
brain ischemia (24). SUMOylation is increased during
animal hibernation and clinically relevant hypothermia
(12, 18, 25, 26), and it has been proposed that increased
global SUMOylation is a key mechanism underlying
hypothermia-induced protection (12, 18, 21, 27). Taken
together, increasing global SUMOylation is a promising
new clinical strategy for protecting the brain against is-
chemic damage.
Accordingly, we recently explored alternative ap-
proaches in an effort to increase SUMOylation, and
identified specific inhibitors of miR-182 or -183 (28).
The rationale for this study was based on the fact that
levels of the miR-200 family and the miR-182 family
decrease within the squirrel brain during the torpor
phase when global SUMOylation is increased, and
further, that inhibiting these microRNAs serves to in-
crease global SUMOylation in cell culture (28, 29). A
number of compounds were identified that could in-
crease global SUMOylation and ultimately provide
protective effects after OGD/restoration of oxygen and
glucose in vitro (28).
Conjugation of SUMO, however, is not the only axis
by which SUMOylation may be targeted; increases in
global SUMOylation can also be achieved by inhibiting
SUMO-deconjugation; SUMOylation is a highly dy-
namic process and is balanced through deconjugat-
ing activity (i.e., isopeptidase activity) of the various
SENPs, comprising SENP1–3 and -5–7 in mammals (15,
30). In vitro, SENP1 and -2 demonstrate broad speci-
ficity for all SUMO paralogues, with the latter bearing a
preference for SUMO-2/3; both also process SUMO
precursors and do not edit SUMO-2/3 chains (31).
However, it has been suggested that SENP1 may be
specific for SUMO-1-conjugated proteins in vivo (32).
SENP3 and -5–7 have a preference for SUMO-2/3, with
only SENP5 being able to process SUMO precursors;
and SENP6 and -7 being capable of chain editing (31).
Among the SENPs, SENP1 and -2 have the highest
catalytic activity (33).
It is prudent to note that the role of the SENPs in
neuroprotection remains controversial, and that al-
though the current body of knowledge suggests that
SENP3 may be an ideal target for therapies centered
on decreasing SUMO deconjugation (34–36), technical
challenges preclude obtaining sufficient quantities of
stable or active SENP3 catalytic domain for use in high-
throughput screening (37). Given this technical limita-
tion and the knowledge that deletion of SENP2 in vivo
dramatically increases both SUMO-1 and -2/3 conju-
gation (38), we chose to use SENP2 and its catalytic
domain as our screening targets.
Accordingly, herein we describe a process capable
of identifying and characterizing approved agents that
inhibit SENP2, thus bearing the potential to modulate
SUMO pathways in ischemic stroke. The validity of
the quantitative high-throughput screen (qHTS), a
titration-based approach for the rapid testing of small-
molecule libraries, was confirmed using orthogonal
assays comprising immunoblot analysis, target en-
gagement, and the induction of neuroprotection dur-
ing OGD.

 Antibodies
Anti-SUMO-2/3 and anti-SUMO-1 rabbit polyclonal antibodies
were developed in-house (NIH) (39). Anti-SENP2 (H-300) rabbit
polyclonal IgG was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology
(Dallas, TX, USA). Anti-b-actin mouse monoclonal IgG was
purchased from Millipore-Sigma.
qHTS AlphaScreen assay miniaturization, primary
screen, and hit validation
The AlphaScreen (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA) assay used
in this study was established within our laboratory and has been
described in detail (40). The assay uses a recombinant substrate,
SS3HS2 [His-SUMO2(K11R) conjugated to Strep-SUMO3DGG],
that resembles a physiologically relevant SUMOylated protein
(SUMO-2 conjugated to SUMO-3) (Fig. 1A). The spatial prox-
imity between the His-tagand Strep-tag within the intact SS3HS2
recombinant protein allows for excitation at 680 nm and the
generation of an emission signal at 520–600 nm via the transfer of
singlet oxygen [Δ·O2] from the Strep-tactin donor beads to the
nickel chelate acceptor beads. If substrate SS3HS2 is ultimately
cleaved by an SENP, the distance between the His-tag and Strep-
tag is increased, thereby resulting in a dramatic decrease in
emission signal. A small-molecule inhibitor of SENP prevents
substrate cleavage, maintaining signal and allowing the identi-
fication of putative hits and lead compounds. In this study, our
AlphaScreen assay was further optimized for use in low-volume
settings (384- and 1536-well, white, solid-bottom plates; Greiner
Bio-One, Monroe, NC, USA). The human SENP2 catalytic do-
main (hSENP2c) was purchased from Enzo Life Sciences (BML-
UW9765-0100), and the substrate SS3HS2 was produced as has
been described (40). The final concentrations of enzyme and
substrate were determined by performing a substrate titration in
the 384-well format at a fixed bead concentration of 5 mg/ml
(Supplemental Fig. 1A; mixture of Strep-Tactin donor and (His)6-
nickel chelate acceptor beads). Based on these results, we moved
forwardwith a 100 nM concentrationofsubstrate and performed
an enzyme titration and time course in the 1536-well format
(Supplemental Fig. 1B). An enzyme concentration of 10 nM and
an incubation time of 30 min were chosen to balance the need for
a low concentration of reagents and a large signal window. The
miniaturized assay (final volume, 4 ml) used the following pro-
tocol. First, 2 ml of hSENP2c (final concentration 10 nM) or buffer
[25 mM hydroxyethyl piperazineethanesulfonic acidHEPES (pH
7.5)and100mMNaClwith0.01%Tween20]weredispensedinto
a 1536-well, solid-bottom, white plate (Greiner Bio One). Then,
SUMO2-aldehyde (an irreversible SENP inhibitor; final concen-
tration 65.4–143 nM) control, compounds, or DMSO neutral
control were pin transferred (23 nl; Wako Automation, Rich-
mond, VA, USA) and incubated for 15 min at room temperature,
followed by addition of 1 ml of SS3HS2 substrate (final concen-
tration100nM).Aftera15minincubation,a1mlmixtureofStrep-
Tactin donor and (His)6-nickel chelate acceptor beads (final
concentration 5 mg/ml; PerkinElmer) was dispensed, and sam-
ples were incubated for additional 30 min at room temperature,
followed by a read on an EnVision plate reader with the 1536
plate HTS AlphaScreen aperture (AlphaScreen optics; both from
PerkinElmer). The assay showed minimal well-to-well variation
anda Z9factor.0.5.Further,the assayreagents,as formulatedat
the working concentrations, were stable overnight, thereby
allowing an unattended robotic screening (Supplemental Fig.
1C). SUMO2-aldehyde exhibited a concentration-dependent in-
hibition with an IC50 of ;11 nM (Supplemental Fig. 1D), con-
sistent with our previous results (40). The above assay was used
in a screen against a collection of 4096 samples contained within
both the Library of Pharmaceutically Active Compounds
(LOPAC1280; Millipore-Sigma) and the NIH Chemical Genomics
Center (NCGC) Pharmaceutical Collection (NPC) compound li-
brary (41). Each compound was tested as a 5- or 7-point dilution
series, with concentrations ranging from 3.6 nM to 57.2 mM.
Cell-free SENP activity assays
A cell-free SENP2 activity assay was used to confirm the inhibi-
tory efficacy of the 71 compounds selected from the AlphaScreen
on the isopeptidase activity of SENP2 (40). hSENP2c at 2 nM was
incubated with compounds at 100 mM before the addition of
SS3HS2 at 400 nM. Results were visualized via immunoblot
analysis. Total inhibition of hSENP2c activity was defined as the
absence of a cleaved SUMO band at ;18 kDa. The same
method was used to explore the capacity of those compounds
identified as noncytotoxic total inhibitors (i.e., 13 compounds)
of hSENP2c with regard to the human SENP1 catalytic domain
(hSENP1c) (Boston Biochem, Cambridge, MA, USA). Gluta-
thione S-transferase controls were not used in our cell-free
SENP activity assay.
Cell culture
The rat neuroblastoma cell line B35 was cultured in DMEM
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) supplemented
with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Atlanta
Biologicals, Flowery Branch, GA, USA), 100 U/ml penicillin,
and 100 mg/ml streptomycin in 5% CO2 at 37°C. Of note, the
B35 cell line was confirmed to be Mycoplasma negative with the
MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland).
Cytotoxicity
An ATP-content assay using a luminescent readout was used
to measure the cytotoxicity of the 19 total inhibitors of
hSENP2c in B35 neuroblastoma cells. Compounds identified
as hits in the primary assay were dissolved in DMSO as 10 mM
stock solutions, and plated into a 1536-well plate as a 3-fold,
11-point serial dilution, ranging from 57.5 mM to 236.6 nM
(final concentration). B35 neuroblastoma cells were dispensed
into 1536-well, white, collagen-coated plates (Corning,
Corning, NY, USA), at a total of 2000 cells per well in 4 ml
medium with a Multidrop Combi dispenser (Thermo Fisher
Scientific). After a 16 h incubation at 5% CO2 and 37°C, 23 nl of
compounds were transferred to the assay plates via a NX-TR
pintool station (Wako Scientific Solutions, San Diego, CA,
USA), resulting in a 173.9-fold dilution. Cells were incubated
with the compounds for an additional 18 or 24 h in a humid-
ified incubator at 5% CO2 and 37°C. Cellular ATP levels were
quantitated by adding 4 ml of detection reagent (CellTiter-Glo;
Promega, Madison, WI, USA), and the resultant luminescence
was detected on the ViewLux plate reader (PerkinElmer). The
activity of each compound was normalized to vehicle control
wells (no killing) and 100 mM tamoxifen (100% killing). IC50
values were calculated from dose-response curves using
Prism software (GraphPad Prism, La Jolla, CA, USA).
CETSA
CETSA was used to investigate target engagement of the 13
nontoxic compounds with SENP2, as described by Almqvist
etal. (42), with some modifications.In brief, 5 3 106 cells/ml were
suspended in DMEM without glucose and phenol red (Thermo
Fisher Scientific), lysed via ultrasonication on ice, and treated
with 100 mM of compound in 0.1% DMSO for 1 h at 37°C with
mixing every 10–15 min. The cell suspensions were then

 Figure 1. Compound triaging paradigm. A qHTS (AlphaScreen) (1) identified 71 putative inhibitors of SENP2 from the NPC and
LOPAC1280 libraries. These compounds were taken into a cell-free hSENP2 catalytic activity assay (2), and 19 were identified as
being total inhibitors of SENP2 catalytic activity. A toxicity screen (3) of those 19 compounds in B35 rat neuroblastoma cells
identified 6 that were cytotoxic at 18 h. The 13 remaining nontoxic compounds were tested for target engagement with SENP2
using CETSA in total cell lysates (4); 8 were determined to be engagers. B35 cells were treated with those 8 compounds at doses
of 0.5, 2, and 10 mM, and the levels of SUMO-1 and -2/3 conjugation were measured with Western blot analysis (5) to confirm in
vitro upregulation of SUMO conjugation via inhibition of SENP2 activity by 4 compounds that were then used to treat rat B35
cells in an in vitro stroke model (OGD) (6).

 aliquoted into 100-ml volumes, which were heated for 3.5 minat
the appropriate temperatures in a 96-well Veriti thermal cy-
cler (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Samples were then centrifuged
at 15,000 g for 15 min at 4°C to separate stable and denatured
proteins. The supernatants were transferred and mixed with
an equal volume of 23 Laemmli loading buffer and 10% 2-
ME, and incubated for 10 min at 90°C. Proteins were sepa-
rated on 4–20% Tris-glycine gels (Thermo Fisher Scientific)
and transferred to PVDF membranes (Thermo Fisher Scien-
tific). Images were taken with the FluorChem system (Protein
Simple, San Jose, CA, USA). Protein expression levels were
determined via densitometric analysis of the bands corre-
sponding to the proteins of interest by using ImageJ (NIH).
Target engagement of compounds was evaluated quantita-
tively as a significant increase in remaining SENP2 protein at
temperatures equal to or greater than the melting temperature
vs. the DMSO control.
Molecular docking calculations
Ligand models were developed using Avogadro (v1.2.0) (43)
and converted to a protein data bank, partial charge (q), and
atom type (T) format using AutoDockTools (v.1.5.6) (44).
Crystal structure 2IO2, human SENP2 in complex with
RanGAP1-SUMO1 (45), was obtained from the Research
Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics Protein Data Bank
(46). The RanGAP1-SUMO1 conjugate was deleted before
docking. Docking calculations were performed using Auto-
Dock Vina (v.1.1.2) (47) with the Vina Control and Post Pro-
cessing Tools extension (http://www.biochemsolutions.com). A
cubic search space of 30 3 30 3 30 ˚
A was used, centered on the
reported catalytic site of the target enzyme (delimited by
residues Trp410, His478, Gln542, and C548S). Lowest-energy
ligand poses were rendered using PyMOL (v.0.99rc6; DeLano
Scientific, Palo Alto, CA, USA) and intermolecular interac-
tions analyzed using Discovery Studio Visualizer (v.4.5; Bio-
via, San Diego, CA, USA).
Western blot analysis
The 8 compounds that were determined to be engagers by
CETSA wereassessed invitroin the B35 cellline. Inbrief, B35 cells
were plated at 5 3 105 cells per well into 6-well collagen-coated
tissue culture plates and allowed to adhere and grow overnight
before treatment with compounds in 0.2% DMSO for 18 h.
Growth mediumwas removed,and thecells weregently washed
with PBS before being lysed [100 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 2% SDS,
50 mM EDTA, and 20% glycerol] and boiled for 10 min at 95°C.
Samples were subsequently sonicated on ice and incubated at
95°Cfor5 min.Protein concentrationswere normalizedusingthe
Pierce Bicinchoninic Protein Assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific)
before separation on 4–20% Tris-Glycine gels and transfer to
PVDF membranes. Images were taken with the FluorChem
system (Protein Simple). Protein expression levels were de-
termined via densitometric analysis of the bands corresponding
to the proteins of interest using ImageJ. All densities were nor-
malized to the corresponding b-actin levels and expressed as the
ratio to the control (DMSO alone).
Oxygen/glucose deprivation and the assessment of
cell death
The 4 compounds that were determined to be engagers by
CETSA and were capable of upregulating SUMOylation were
assessed for their ability to protect cells from OGD–induced cell
death. OGD was performed as previously described, with slight
modifications (48). We subjected B35 neuroblastoma cells that
had been plated at 7.5 3 105 cells/well to 20 h of OGD; cells were
incubated with compounds in 0.2% DMSO throughout the 4 h
preconditioning and 20 h OGD periods. Induction of OGD was
executed by replacing the basal culture medium with DMEM
lacking both glucose and sodium pyruvate (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) followed by incubation in a hypoxic incubator
containing 95% N2, 5% CO2, and ,0.1% O2. Oxygen levels
were maintained at 0.1% or less using a ProOx 110 compact
oxygen controller (BioSpherix, Parish, NY, USA). After hyp-
oxic incubation, cells were detached with papain after wash-
ing with 1 mM EDTA in PBS. Cell death was assessed via
nuclear staining with Hoechst 33342 and propidium iodide
followed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis; typ-
ically, 5 3 104 events were captured. The percentages of vital
or apoptotic and necrotic cells in compound-treatment con-
ditions were normalized to those in the DMSO condition to
derive a fold difference for survival.
Animals
Animal experiments were approved by the Duke University
AnimalCareandUseCommittee.Inbrief,1hafterC57/BL6mice
were injected with ebselen (at 12 mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle DMSO,
their cortical brain tissue was extracted and snap frozen and ul-
timately evaluated via Western blotting for levels of global
SUMOylation.
Statistical analyses
Unless otherwise noted, Student’s t test, or 1-way ANOVA, or
both, with Dunnett’s post hoc correction as appropriate, were
used to test the significance of differences between conditions, as
detailed in figure legends. Values of P # 0.05 were deemed sta-
tistically significant.
RESULTS
qHTS identifies inhibitors of SENP2
We set out to identify compounds capable of upregulating
SUMOylation through the inhibition of the deconjugating
SUMO-specific isopeptidase SENP2. To accomplish this
identification, we used the experimental workflow and
compound triage outlined in Fig. 1, which was centered
on hits obtained with a primary qHTS assay with the
AlphaScreen format (40, 49). We screened the NCATS
NPC and Sigma LOPAC1280 libraries, which consisted of
4096 compounds, where 166 compounds were identified
as hits (Supplemental Table 1). Of the 166 compounds, 99
exhibited inhibition in at least 1 of the incubation times
used during confirmatory screening, and of those 71 were
inactive within the counterscreen and were therefore
chosen for further testing.
Select compounds inhibit hSENP2c and
are nontoxic
To determine the effect of the active compounds iden-
tified via the primary screen on the inhibition of SENP2
activity, the 71 compounds were tested in an orthogonal
cell-free assay with the recombinant substrates SS3HS2

 and hSENP2c. hSENP2c was incubated with com-
pounds at 100 mM before the addition of SS3HS2 and
results of the experiment were visualized by Western
blot analysis with a SUMO-2/3 antibody. Total in-
hibition of hSENP2c activity was defined as the absence
of a cleaved SUMO band at ;18 kDa. We demonstrated
that 19 of the 71 hits effected complete inhibition of the
catalytic domain (Fig. 2). To exclude the confounding
contributions of compound cytotoxicity downstream,
a cell-viability assay was performed in parallel by us-
ing measurement of ATP levels. We found that 6
compounds displayed cytotoxicity at either 18 or 24 h
of incubation (Fig. 3). Cells were treated with the
compounds for an equivalent amount of time when
the levels of global SUMOylation were ultimately
explored via Western blot analysis. Of note, six of
the compounds shown to inhibit SENP2 were also
determined to be inhibitors of the human SENP1
Figure 2. A cell-free assay for inhibition of SENP2 catalytic activity. Final concentration of all compounds was 100 mM. The band
corresponding to the SS3HS2 conjugate was visualized at ;36 kDa. Total inhibition of hSENP2c was defined as the qualitatively
determined near-total absence of the band corresponding to cleaved free SUMO products, visualized at ;18 kDa. The following
compounds were identified as total inhibitors of hSENP2c activity: tenatoprazole, oxycinchophen, acriflavine hydrochloride,
6-thioguanine, disulfiram, dicyclopentamethylenethiuram disulfide, tetramethythiuram monosulfide, L-ascorbic acid, isoprenaline

 catalytic domain, suggesting that this screening
approach can be used to identify inhibitors of all
SENPs (i.e., pan-SENP inhibitors) (Supplemental Fig.
2). This finding is most likely attributable to partial
conservation of the C-terminal catalytic regions among
the SENPs, being that the SENP2 catalytic frag-
ment was used as the screening target during the
qHTS (31).

 CETSA demonstrates compound target
engagement with SENP2 within the cell
As thermal shifts have been shown capable of revealing
thermal stabilization of proteins upon ligand binding (50),
we performed CETSA to confirm target engagement in a
more physiologic scenario. The assay involves treatment
of cells or cell lysates with a compound of interest, heating
to denature and precipitate proteins, and the separation of
celldebrisandaggregatesfromthesolubleprotein fraction
(42, 50). Via a series of pilot experiments (Supplemental
Fig. 3) we determined that the melting temperature of
SENP2 was ;76°C. Of the 13 compounds identified as
inhibitors of hSENP2c in the cell-free system that were also
nontoxic (Figs. 2 and 3), CETSA analysis indicated en-
gagementwithendogenousSENP2in8testedcompounds
(Fig. 4).
Molecular docking calculations position the
lowest-energy poses of the most potent
inhibitors at the active site of a human SENP2
crystal structure
Models of each of the 8 best candidate inhibitors (as de-
termined via CETSA) were subjected to docking calcula-
tions with a crystal structure-derived model of human
SENP2(45)(Fig.5A,incomplexwithRanGAP1-SUMO-1),
to establish their lowest energy binding poses (Fig. 5C–J).
In each instance, the lowest energy configuration situated
the ligand at the entrance to a tunnel through the solvent-
accessible surface of the enzyme (delineated by Trp410,
His474, Lys476, Val477, and Trp479). This tunnel guides
the C-terminal tail of SUMO-1 toward the catalytic resi-
dues of the SENP2 structure (Fig. 5B), including His478
and Cys548 (Ser548 in this inactivated mutant), where
deconjugation would occur upon exit. Eachof the putative
inhibitors would appear to occlude the entrance to the
tunnel, suggesting a mode of action whereby these ligands
impede the proper approach of the SUMO C-terminal tail
to the catalytic site of the SENP. Indeed, isoprenaline and
ethyl protocatechuate (Fig. 5F, G, respectively) appear to
fully occupy the tunnel enclosed by Trp410, whereas each
oftheotherligandscoincidespatiallywith severaloftheC-
terminal residues of the overlaid structure of complexed
SUMO-1. Binding of the inhibitors to SENP2 is promoted
by a variety of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions
with residues at the entrance to the tunnel, as well as van
der Waals contacts with the surfaces of the enzyme. In-
teractionswith Trp410orHis474orboth are common to all
ligands, involving a mixture of hydrogen bonding and
p–p interactions. 6-Thioguanine demonstrated a particu-
larly elaborate network of hydrogen bonding to multi-
ple residues around the tunnel entrance, including both
Trp410 and His474.
SENP2 inhibitors increase SUMO conjugation
in B35 cells
To determine their effects on the induction of SUMO-
conjugation, the remaining 8 compounds were tested in
orthogonal cell-based assays again using B35 cells. The
compounds were incubated with the neuroblastoma cells
for 18 h at 3 concentrations. Immunoblot analysis effec-
tively demonstrated that 4 of these compounds were in-
deed capable of upregulating SUMO-1 and/or SUMO-2/
3 conjugation, thereby confirming the biologic validity of
the positive hits resulting from the screen (Fig. 6).
Select compounds are capable of inducing
protection against oxygen and glucose
deprivation in B35 cells, and, of these, ebselen
upregulates global SUMOylation within the
brains of mice after intraperitoneal injection
The ultimate goal of this process is to identify small mol-
ecules that might be used for the treatment of ischemic
stroke via the inhibition of SENPs. The 4 compounds that
had shown increased SUMOylation in B35 cells, were
consequentlytestedfortheirputativeefficacyinprotecting
cells from OGD in vitro. Two compounds (ebselen and 6-
thioguanine) were protective against OGD-induced cell
death in B35 cells (Fig. 7A, B). Last, we tested ebselen in
vivo. Here, ebselen administered by IP injection signifi-
cantly increased the level of global SUMOylation within
the brain in vivo (Fig. 7C).
DISCUSSION
In this study, we sought to describe a process capable of
identifying and characterizing small molecules with the
potential to be developed or repurposed as clinical thera-
pies for ischemic stroke through the inhibition of the
SENPs.
Brain ischemia is a complex pathologic process in-
volving modulation of numerous signaling pathways(51).
In the past, however, development of neuroprotective
therapies has focused on single signaling pathways; all
such clinical trials have failed (52). New therapeutic
strategies targeting a key regulatory switch that affects
many downstream pathways in brain ischemia should
therefore be considered (51, 53). Notably, mounting evi-
dence indicates that SUMOylation has the potential to be
such a switch, because of its numerous targets and overall
neuroprotective effects in brain ischemia and hypother-
mia. Accordingly, small molecules that inhibit SENP2 and
thus increase SUMOylation must be identified.
Major efforts have been invested in screening for spe-
cific SENP inhibitors via both in silico and conventional
high-throughput screening methods (54, 55). However,
few of these screens have identified candidates with me-
dicinal properties and have made use of physiologically
relevant substrates (54). Accordingly, in this study, we
miniaturized an AlphaScreen-based qHTS assay to a 1536-
well format designed to screen for inhibitors of the iso-
peptidase activity of SENPs and used an endogenous
SUMO-conjugated protein substrate and the conserved
SENP catalytic domain (40). Understanding the require-
ments for a drug or compound to bear translational rele-
vance,compounds from the NPC and LOPAC1280libraries

 (i.e., a myriad of approved drugs) were first tested in a cell-
free screen with recombinant proteins, and then in a
cytotoxicity screen. Only compounds that demonstrated
inhibition of SENP2 activity and displayed a lack of cyto-
toxicitywere approved tocontinuein thistriagingprocess.
Subsequently, those compounds were tested for their
ability to definitively engage with SENP2 in an in silico
computer model of binding energies and poses, as well as
the CETSA, which is capable of definitely demonstrating
target engagement and direct binding to a protein target of
interest within a cell (50). Neuroblastoma cells were then
treated with these compounds to validate that they were
indeed capable of increasing SUMO-1 and -2/3 conjuga-
tion in vitro via the inhibition of SENP2. The select final
group of compounds was then tested against OGD, an in
vitro model of ischemia.
Some of the compounds identified or triaged ultimately
were found capable of inducing protection against OGD-
induced cell death. We recently confirmed the validity of
such an approach, having demonstrated for the first time
that increasingglobal SUMOylation viathe use of an SENP
inhibitor (i.e., quercetin) is in fact neuroprotective in cell
culture (48). Of the 2 compounds identified that were ul-
timately shown to provide protection in the faceof OGD, it
is prudent to note that 6-thioguanine (56), a thiol analogue
of guanine used asa chemotherapeutic,is far from an ideal
candidate but could ultimately represent a core molecular
structure for future medicinal chemistry explorations
designed to engineer ideal clinical-grade inhibitors of
SENP2. In line with the inhibition of SENP2, purine an-
alogues, such as 6-thioguanine and 2-aminopurine, have
been found to inhibit protein kinase N in vitro (57).
The identification of ebselen (a synthetic organo-
selenium compound) supports the validity of this screen-
ing paradigm’s ability to identify inhibitors with potential
for repurposing as stroke therapeutics. Ebselen is an
organo-selenium compound that was originally found
to reduce hydroperoxides owing to its glutathione
peroxidase–like activity. This antioxidant activity was
later attributed to the neuroprotective effects of ebselen
observed in various experimental stroke models (58, 59).
Concerns related to potential selenium toxicity and in-
sufficient efficacy reported in clinical trials have thus far
precluded its clinical development (58, 59). However, it is
important to note that the clinical trial performed did
identifybenefitsfor those patients treated early(i.e., before
24 h) (60), thereby highlighting the potential of this com-
poundasaprophylacticforthosepatientsatincreasedrisk
of a cerebrovascular accident (e.g., undergoing carotid
endarterectomy, having a diagnosis of cerebral autosomal
dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leu-
koencephalopathy or Binswanger’s disease) or have been
shown by current brain-imaging protocols to have sal-
vageable tissue after a stroke (61). The increased level of
global SUMOylation demonstrated within the brain by
ebselenis similar to hypothermia-induced levels that have
been shown to protect brains from ischemic damage (27).
However, whether this SUMOylation-activator activity
of ebselen contributes to its protective effect will need fur-
ther clarification. For such compounds, additional target
identification and profiling techniques, such as thermal
proteomeprofilingmaybeusefultowardfullyelucidating
the mechanism by which neuroprotection is conferred.
As both in vitro and in vivo data have illustrated that
increased global SUMOylation is neuroprotective in brain
ischemia, we have established a platform for pursuing
small molecules capable of increasing global SUMOyla-
tion. It should be noted that this neuroprotective effect
arises from the summed effect of SUMOylated proteins on
overall outcome, as the SUMO proteome comprises di-
verse proteins reported to be involved in both prosurvival
and prodeath pathways. For example, dynamin-related
protein 1 SUMOylation suppresses cytochrome c release
andprotectsthecellfromapoptosis(34),whereashypoxia-
inducible factor (HIF)-1a SUMOylation may promote
HIF-1a degradation and thereby impair HIF-1a–mediated
protective effects after ischemia (62). It must be noted
that current knowledge with regard to specific SUMO
targets involved in brain ischemia is highly limited, and
the potential effects of individual SUMOylated proteins
within complex pathologies such as brain ischemia are
primarily speculative (63).
Although our results validated our approach, only 2
of our identified compounds showed neuroprotective
efficacy in cells. Considering the great potential of
SENP inhibitors for neuroprotection in brain ischemia,
there is a clear need to rapidly identify compounds of
interest, thereby suggesting that larger libraries should
in fact be interrogated. Our platform represents a strong
approach to screening large libraries of small molecules
to identify new classes of compounds that inhibit SENP
isopeptidase activity. Once more ideal candidate com-
pounds are identified in future projects, they should
first be subjected to extensive medicinal chemistry op-
timization to improve potency, specificity, and drug-
like properties. The optimized drug candidates can then
be tested in various brain ischemia models, including
global cerebral ischemia and focal ischemia (transient
and permanent) animal models, using both pre- and
posttreatment paradigms. Ultimately, the most prom-
ising compounds would be expected to advance to
preclinical development with the final goal of trans-
lation into clinical interventions to prevent brain
ischemia-induced damage.
Finally, beyond stroke, this platform may also be used
in future qHTS studies to screen for new classes of inhib-
itors that target SENP isopeptidase activity. For example,
SENP1 has been reported to be an oncogene (64) in various
cancers (e.g., prostate, kidney, bladder, neuroblastoma,
and multiple myeloma), and a strategy targeting SENP1
SENP2 protein at a temperature above the melting point, indicating ligand-binding-induced stabilization; representative
immunoblots shown. The band corresponding to SENP2 (detected at ;64 kDa; expected, ;68 kDa) was cropped in each lane
and the total intensities were measured and expressed as the fold difference relative to the DMSO control at the same

malignancies.
CONCLUSIONS
Therapeutic options for ischemic brain injury remain
extremely limited. During the past decade, substantial
evidence has accumulated to support increases in the
levels of global SUMOylation as a mechanism to protect
the brain from ischemic damage. As such, it is encour-
aging to speculate that pharmaceutically increased
global SUMOylation under normothermic conditions
may provide similar neuroprotection without the
adverse effects associated with hypothermia. To in-
vestigate this possibility, small molecules that can in-
crease global SUMOylation in cells and can cross the
blood–brain barrier have been actively sought. In this
study, we have presented a streamlined process that
effectively identified SENP2 inhibitors with the ability
to increase global SUMOylation in vitro and in vivo. It
is our hope that this finding will ultimately lead to
advanced treatments for patients who have ischemic
brain damage.
