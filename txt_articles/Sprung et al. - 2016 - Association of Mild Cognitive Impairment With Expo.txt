 Patients and Methods—A population-based prospective cohort of Olmsted County, MN, 
residents ages 70-89 years on October 1, 2004, underwent baseline and 15-month interval 
evaluations that included the Clinical Dementia Rating scale, a neurologic evaluation, and 
neuropsychological testing. Anesthesia records after age 40 until last evaluation for MCI were 
abstracted. Proportional hazards regression, adjusting for other known MCI risk factors, was used 
to assess whether exposure to surgical general anesthesia after the age of 40 is associated with the 
incidence of MCI.
Results—Of 1,731 participants (mean age 79), 536 (31%) developed MCI during median 4.8 
years follow-up. Anesthesia exposure was not associated with MCI when analyzed as a 
dichotomous variable (any vs. none, adjusted HR 1.07 [95% CI 0.83-1.37]; P=.61), the number of 
exposures (adjusted HR = 1.05 [0.78-1.42], 1.12 [0.86-1.47], and 1.02 [0.76-1.34] for 1, 2-3, and 
≥4 exposures compared to no exposure as the reference; P=.73), or as the total cumulative duration 
of exposure (adjusted HR =1.00 [0.98-1.01] per 60 min increase, P=.83). In secondary sensitivity 
analyses anesthesia after age 60 was associated with incident MCI (adjusted HR =1.25 
[1.02-1.55], P=.04), as was exposure in the previous 20 and 10 years.
Conclusion—We found no significant association between cumulative exposure to surgical 
anesthesia after age 40 and MCI. However, these data do not exclude the possibility that anesthetic 
exposures occurring later in life may be associated an increase in the rate of incident MCI.

Introduction
Exposure of the elderly to anesthesia and surgery can transiently affect postoperative 
cognitive function in some patients, a phenomenon referred to as postoperative cognitive 
dysfunction (POCD).1-3 Whether such exposures lead to more prolonged cognitive 
impairment remains unclear. Some preclinical studies suggest that exposure to volatile 
anesthetics cause neurohistological changes and subsequent memory impairment consistent 
with Alzheimer dementia (AD) or dementia generally.4-6 The majority of clinical research 
did not find an association between exposure to anesthesia and dementia.7-10 However, there 
are several challenges to conduct this type of studies. Cognitive changes sufficient to meet 
criteria for the diagnosis of dementia develop over many months or years, posing challenges 
to examine association between exposure and dementia. In particular, many studies have not 
been able to ascertain that persons without dementia do not have very mild, subtle, cognitive 
changes.7, 8 Furthermore, comorbidities necessitating surgery may themselves contribute to 
cognitive impairment,11, 12 confounding the interpretation of associations. Finally, the 
clinical diagnosis of dementia may not be the most sensitive measure of prolonged cognitive 
impairment. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), defined as a stage of cognitive impairment 
between normal function and dementia, has been recently introduced as a useful clinical and 
research diagnostic category.13, 14 In this context, MCI diagnosis provides an additional 
opportunity to explore the association between anesthesia and cognitive function with

 potentially greater sensitivity to the effects of surgical procedures requiring general 
anesthesia.
The present study is based on a prospectively assembled cohort of Olmsted County, MN 
residents enrolled in the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (MCSA).15 This long-standing study 
employs rigorous longitudinal assessment of cognitive function in a large population-based 
cohort. The primary aims of the MCSA are to examine the incidence, prevalence, and risk 
factors for cognitive decline.15-17 It has identified several factors, including age, education, 
sex, ApoE genotype, diabetes, depression, cardiovascular disease, and stroke as risk factors 
for incident MCI.18In the present study we combined the resources of Rochester 
Epidemiology Project (REP),19 which provides access to all medical records of residents of 
Olmsted County, MN, and the MCSA study data to test the hypothesis that exposure to 
general anesthesia after the age of 40 is associated with the incidence of MCI in the elderly. 
The study cohort included patients who were cognitively normal at the time of their 
enrollment in the MCSA so that the primary outcome of incident MCI could be assessed.
METHODS
This study was approved by the institutional review boards of the Mayo Clinic and Olmsted 
Medical Center, Rochester, MN. At the time of enrollment in the MCSA, all participants 
provided written informed consent for longitudinal assessment. This analysis included those 
MCSA participants who had also provided prior authorization for the use of their medical 
information in research (Minnesota Statute 144.335), such that their anesthesia and surgical 
records could be reviewed. Manuscript preparation was in accordance with the STROBE 
checklist for cohort studies (www.strobe-statement.org).
Design Overview
This is a prospective population-based cohort designed to study the factors associated with 
decline in cognitive function. Details of the study design have been previously reported.15 
MCSA procedures are summarized as follows.16, 17
Study Participants
Residents of Olmsted County were eligible for enrollment in the MCSA. Determination of 
residency status and medical record information was provided by the REP,20-23 a medical 
records linkage system that takes advantage of the fact that most Olmsted County residents 
seek medical care from 2 providers, the Mayo Clinic and Olmsted Medical Center. Both 
sites use a unit medical record which includes all outpatient and inpatient information for 
each patient, with an extensive indexing system based on surgical and medical diagnoses 
maintained by Mayo Clinic. Olmsted County residents who were between 70 and 89 years 
old on October 1, 2004 were identified, randomly selected and invited to participate in the 
study.15
Upon enrollment in the MCSA, participants completed a nurse evaluation including 
questions about memory and risk factor assessment (based on family and medical history), a 
neurological evaluation and a neuropsychological and laboratory (ApoE genotype 
biomarker) evaluation. Self-reported medical history was corroborated using information

 abstracted from the medical records of the records-linkage system. The neurologic 
evaluation included the Short Test of Mental Status,24 a modified Hachinski Scale,25, 26 a 
modified Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale,27 and a questionnaire developed to elicit 
neurologic conditions that could influence cognition. The neuropsychological evaluation 
included subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R) and Wechsler 
Memory Scale-Revised,28 and assessed performance in 4 cognitive domains: memory, 
executive function, language, and visuospatial skills. A study partner (informant) completed 
the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) Scale29 and a Functional Activities Questionnaire.30 In 
addition, the functional status of each subject was elicited from the study partner also using 
the Functional Assessment Questionnaire.30 In the rare instances where there was no 
informant, subjective cognitive impairment was based solely upon information obtained 
from the participant.
Outcome Measures: Diagnosis of normal cognition, MCI and dementia
Subsequent to the evaluations, an expert consensus panel consisting of the physician and 
nurse or study coordinator who evaluated the participant, and a neuropsychologist reviewed 
and discussed all the data for each subject.15 The diagnosis of MCI was based on published 
criteria: 1) impairment in one of the four cognitive domains; 2) cognitive concerns by the 
subject, informant, examining nurse, or physician; 3) essentially normal functional activities, 
and; 4) absence of dementia (based on published criteria).13, 14, 31 Subjects who performed 
within the normal range and did not meet criteria for MCI or dementia were considered as 
cognitively normal. Each diagnosis was made by a consensus decision between the 
physician, neuropsychologist, and nurse or study coordinator.15 Only subjects who were 
cognitively normal at the baseline evaluation and had at least one follow-up evaluation to 
assess incident events were included in the current analysis. Participants were evaluated at 
15-month intervals to assess changes in neurocognitive status and to detect incident MCI or 
dementia using the same protocol used at the baseline evaluation. Since surgery may affect 
cognition, participants were evaluated at least 1 month or longer following an acute illness, 
surgery or procedure.
Data abstraction of anesthesia for surgical and nonsurgical procedures
For all participants medical records were abstracted for each episode of general anesthesia 
between age 40 and the index date of MCI diagnosis or last follow-up in those who did not 
develop MCI. This age was chosen to provide a relatively long exposure history useful to 
perform sensitivity analyses (see Statistical analysis) and was available in the medical 
records for most individuals. For individuals whose medical records began after the age of 
40, anesthetic exposure information was abstracted back to the date their medical records 
started. For each exposure to anesthesia the agents used for induction and maintenance of 
anesthesia, the type of surgery or procedure, and the duration of anesthesia were recorded. 
Episodes of anesthesia with regional block only, as well as those who received sedation and 
subcutaneous injection of local anesthetic, were excluded. All data were entered manually 
into the web-based Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap®) system (Version 3.6.7, 
Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee).32 Anesthetic exposures were retrieved from 
paper medical records, surgical reports, electronic medical records, and all were cross 
checked with the electronic anesthesia database and Data Mart, a Microsoft SQL relational

 data warehouse that provides direct access to electronic medical records data for patients 
across Mayo Clinic Rochester hospitals. Exposures to anesthesia in Olmsted County 
hospitals were identified via REP procedure databases, with detailed information retrieved 
from scanned information, microfilms, and paper medical charts. Surgical anesthetics or 
procedures that were performed outside the Olmsted County and were self-reported in 
medical records were not included as exposures in our analysis.
Statistical analyses
Each individual was considered at risk for MCI from the date of enrollment in the MCSA. 
Proportional hazards regression, with age as the time scale, was used to assess whether 
exposure to surgeries and procedures requiring general anesthesia after the age of 40 was a 
risk factor for development of MCI. Anesthesia exposure was quantified as any vs. none; 
number of exposures (no exposure, 1, 2-3, ≥4), or cumulative exposure in separate analyses. 
To accommodate the surgeries that occurred after enrollment, time dependent variables were 
used when quantifying anesthesia exposure (see below). For the primary analyses the initial 
values for these variables were those calculated using all surgeries from age 40 up to the 
time of enrollment. The values of the variables were then updated to reflect any surgical 
procedures performed following enrollment. Both unadjusted and adjusted analyses were 
performed. For the adjusted analyses, sex, education, marital status, smoking status, alcohol, 
ApoE ε4 genotype, midlife diabetes, midlife hypertension, midlife dyslipidemia, atrial 
fibrillation, congestive heart failure, history of stroke, and coronary artery disease were 
included as covariates, factors found in prior analysis to predict MCI. In all cases, separate 
models were used to evaluate the different anesthesia exposure variables with results 
summarized using hazard ratio estimates and corresponding 95% confidence intervals.
Additional secondary sensitivity analyses were planned a priori. First, to explore the concept 
that risk produced by exposure to anesthesia and procedures increases with age, the primary 
analyses were repeated including only exposures to anesthesia after age 60 (i.e., not 
including exposures prior to age 60). In addition, using a reversible binary time dependent 
variables separate analyses were performed for any exposure to anesthesia in 5, 10, and 20 
year intervals prior to developing MCI or last follow-up visit. For these analyses the time-
dependent indicator variable that was set to 1 at the time of exposure was reset to 0 after the 
given time was elapsed with no further exposure. For example, if a patient who enrolled in 
the MCSA at age 70 was exposed to their first anesthetic on their 53rd birthday, and had no 
additional exposures prior to developing MCI (or last follow-up) at the age of 75; the binary 
variable for any exposure in the preceding 20 years would have value of 1 from the time of 
enrollment until the patient's 73rd birthday, at which point it would be reset to 0. Similar 
analyses were performed using time-dependent variables representing the number of 
exposures and cumulative duration of exposure in the 5 and 10 year intervals prior to 
developing MCI or last follow-up. To explore whether type of surgery is associated with 
MCI, separate proportional hazards regressions were performed using ten categories of 
primary types of surgeries or procedures. In addition, since ApoE genetic testing was 
performed prospectively, and its presence is a known risk for AD,33 we performed 
exploratory analyses to assess whether ApoE ε4 allele status (carrier or non-carrier) is a

 potential effect modifier of exposure effect. Analyses were performed using SAS statistical 
software (Version 9.3, SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC).
RESULTS
Population
A total of 1,813 MCSA participants had normal cognitive function at enrollment and 
returned for at least one follow-up visit. Of these 82 had denied research authorization to 
review their medical records. Thus, the present report includes a total of 1,731 participants 
(865 male and 866 females). For the 1,731 participants, the median duration of follow-up 
was 4.8 years, and the median number of MCSA follow-up visits was 4 (range 1 to 7). The 
mean age at the time of enrollment was 79.3 years. Additional baseline demographic and 
medical history characteristics of participants are presented in Table 1.
Primary Analysis of Association between Surgical Anesthesia and MCI
The median [25th, 75th percentiles] age at the time of the first medical record entry was 30 
[23, 38] years. From review of these medical records 1,467 participants (85% of the cohort) 
received 1 or more surgeries or procedures requiring general anesthesia after the age of 40 (a 
total of 4,976 surgeries). Of these, 4,026 were performed prior to enrollment into the MCSA, 
and 950 were performed after enrollment but prior to development of MCI or last follow-up. 
There were 264 (15%) participants who did not undergo surgery after age 40 years, 333 
(19%) who had a single surgery, 604 (35%) who had 2 or 3 surgeries and 530 (31%) who 
had 4 or more surgeries. Most surgeries (89%) included the use of halogenated inhalational 
agents with the specific agent used reflective of the era when the procedure was conducted 
(Figure 1). For the 4,976 surgeries the median duration of anesthesia was 129 [77, 195] 
minutes. Anesthesia induction was most frequently performed with sodium thiopental (58%) 
or propofol (40%), and the maintenance anesthetic typically included the use of nitrous 
oxide (75%). The most frequent surgeries were general surgery, orthopedic, obstetrics/
gynecology and urologic procedures (Table 2).
During follow-up (median 4.8 years), 536 participants (31%) developed MCI (63.5 per 1000 
person-years). When exposure to surgery utilizing general anesthesia was assessed as a 
dichotomous variable (any vs. none), anesthesia was not associated with incident MCI 
(Table 3). In addition, no association was found between the number of exposures or the 
total cumulative duration of exposure and incident MCI (Table 3). In the planned secondary 
sensitivity analyses examining exposure over more restricted time periods, any exposure to 
anesthesia after the age of 60, exposures within 20 years prior to MCI diagnosis, and 
exposures within 10 years were associated with an increased risk for incident MCI (Table 3). 
However, when analyzed according to the number of exposures, the observed associations 
were not consistent with a causal dose-response effect. For example, for each analysis 
hazard ratio values for 4 or more exposures were less than for single exposures and their 
95% CI included unity. When exposure was quantified as the cumulative duration of 
anesthesia, none of the associations were statistically significant.

 To explore whether type of surgery is associated with MCI, separate proportional hazards 
regressions for exposure to 10 categories of primary procedures were performed (Table 4). 
No significant associations were found between exposure to various types of surgeries under 
general anesthesia and incident MCI after age 40. However, when examining exposures over 
more restricted time periods, undergoing non-bypass cardiac/vascular surgery was associated 
with incident MCI; no other significant associations were found. Finally, in a secondary 
analysis to assess whether individuals with the ApoE ε4 allele are more susceptible to 
potential effects of anesthesia, the primary analyses were repeated with the anesthesia 
exposure by ApoE ε4 status interaction included in the model. In all cases no interactions 
were detected (all P>.21 data not shown).
DISCUSSION
The main finding of our study is that cumulative exposure to procedures requiring general 
anesthesia after the age 40 was not associated with the development of incident MCI in 
cognitively normal elderly participants. At the same time, our data do not exclude the 
possibility that anesthetic exposures occurring later in life may be associated an increase in 
the rate of incident MCI, especially in patients undergoing vascular surgery
Clinical experience and case series showed that postoperative transient cognitive dysfunction 
is not uncommon in elderly,1-3, 34, 35 and more so after cardiac surgery.36-38 Presently it is 
unclear whether permanent cognitive deficits may be directly associated with undergoing 
surgical procedures in the elderly,2 and a phenotype and consistent nomenclature for 
“postoperative cognitive decline” still remains to be defined. Even if surgical procedures 
under general anesthesia are associated with permanent cognitive deficits, causation is 
difficult to assess, with potential factors including major illnesses necessitating surgery, the 
considerable physiologic trespass caused by surgery itself (e.g., inflammatory responses),39 
perioperative delirium,40 adverse events during anesthesia (hypotension, hypoxemia), and 
the anesthetics and adjuvant drugs themselves.41 Even nonsurgical hospitalization of elderly 
for acute care may be associated with higher likelihood for incident dementia.12 As recently 
reviewed,11 pre-clinical studies provide support for concept that inflammatory responses 
may affect long-term cognition, while the evidence to support an effect of anesthetic drugs 
themselves is more equivocal.
The multiplicity of factors that may determine cognitive function poses major challenges to 
observational clinical studies in this area, whose limitations have been extensively 
discussed.35 A meta-analysis of available studies concluded that there is little evidence that 
procedures requiring general anesthesia are associated with incident dementia.7 Consistent 
with this analysis, a subsequent case-control study of the Olmsted County, MN population 
found no association between exposure after the age of 45 and incident dementia.8 Indeed, 
dementia is the outcome of interest in most of the current literature.7, 8, 10 Avidan et al.9 
examined long-term cognitive trajectories after noncardiac surgery, including 3 groups: 
cognitively normal individuals (N=214), those with very mild dementia (N=225 or MCI), 
and those with dementia (N=136). They found that long-term cognitive decline was not 
independently attributable to surgery or nonsurgical illness with hospitalization, and these 
events were not associated with accelerated progression of cognitive decline.9

 The results of the primary analysis, examining exposure to anesthesia as a risk factor after 
adjusting for relevant covariates, are consistent with the bulk of prior work, including the 
study of Avidan et al,9 failing to demonstrate an association between procedures requiring 
anesthesia and sustained deleterious neurocognitive outcomes.7, 8, 10 This finding was robust 
irrespective of how exposure was quantified. However, the planned secondary sensitivity 
analyses, which considered exposures within periods of time more proximate to MCI 
diagnosis or end of follow-up, revealed potential complexities. Analysis of this more 
proximate exposure, which does not take into account exposures earlier in life, revealed 
significant associations between MCI and exposure to surgical anesthesia in some analyses. 
This finding would be consistent with the concept that the brain may be more vulnerable to 
exposures at a more advanced age, such that risk in these analyses would not be diluted by 
exposures at younger age that may not pose risk. However, some of our findings may be at 
odds with this interpretation. First, if exposure to surgical anesthesia caused MCI (or is a 
factor that may unveil MCI in those already at risk), a dose-response relationship might be 
expected with more exposure associated with increased hazard ratios. However, this was not 
observed; the confidence interval for the hazard ratios for the greatest number of anesthetic 
exposures included unity, and there was no association when exposure was quantified as the 
cumulative duration of anesthesia. This could imply a threshold effect, beyond which greater 
exposure does not confer greater risk. Second, associations were not observed for exposures 
within the most recent period analyzed (within 5 years), a finding not consistent with age-
related vulnerability. However, it is possible that if exposure is causative, it may take more 
than five years for MCI to develop. Finally, when analyzing exposures to specific types of 
procedures we found that only vascular surgery after age 60 was associated with incident 
MCI. This raises the question of whether a general anesthesia and surgery, especially for 
vascular procedures, was a marker of more severe comorbidity, in this case severe 
atherosclerosis, known to be associated with vascular dementia and MCI.42, 43 Nonetheless, 
these results do not exclude the possibility that exposures to anesthesia and surgery or 
procedures at a more advanced age may be associated with incident MCI.
Strengths and limitations
Important strengths of this study include utilizing a well-described, population-based cohort 
receiving multiple rigorous longitudinal assessments of cognitive function that allow for 
precise ascertainment of MCI. Through the REP,19 a wealth of details regarding medical 
comorbidity and anesthesia exposure history is also available. However, this and other 
observational studies have limitations. Primary among these is inability to distinguish 
between potential effects of the procedural experience and the underlying conditions which 
make the procedures necessary, such that procedures may simply serve as a marker for 
underlying factors that contribute to cognitive decline. In addition we cannot distinguish 
between the effects of anesthesia from the stress of the surgical procedure. Furthermore, our 
primary analysis examines exposures to surgical anesthesia over a very long period (since 
age 40), and it is likely that same types of surgeries over decades differ by the level of stress, 
postoperative morbidities, length of hospitalization (all risks for dementia): controlling for 
these variables in our retrospective study was not possible. Nonparticipation bias is also 
potentially problematic in several ways. We chose to study incident MCI, such that all 
subjects had normal cognition at baseline because we wanted to be certain that the onset of

 cognitive impairment did not precede the exposure to surgery and anesthesia. Although this 
approach has advantages in terms of analysis, it may also select for those individuals who 
are less vulnerable, as presumably the most vulnerable may have already developed 
cognitive deficits at the time of recruitment and may have been less likely to enroll. In 
addition, patients who undewernt surgery and had died prior to age 70 were not eligible for 
enrolment. Thus, it is important to reiterate that our findings are only relevant for persons 
who were healthy enough to reach up 70-89 years of age on October 1, 2004 and were 
cognitively normal. It is also possible that if procedures occurred shortly prior to a 
longitudinal assessment, any transient cognitive dysfunction may have contributed to a 
diagnosis of MCI. However, the lack of association between exposure within 5 years and 
MCI argues against this possibility. The racial and ethnic composition of Olmsted County is 
considerably less diverse than the overall US population, so our results may not apply to 
other populations. Finally, the analysis may not have been sufficiently powered to detect 
small effects.
In conclusion, in study participant who were cognitively normal at enrollment, cumulative 
exposure to surgical anesthesia after age 40 was not significantly associated with incident 
MCI. However, these data do not exclude the possibility that anesthetic exposures occurring 
later in life may be associated an increase in the rate of incident MCI, especially in patients 
undergoing vascular surgery

 Summary statement
In this population-based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging there was no association between 
exposure to general anesthesia for surgery and procedures after the age of 40 and mild 
cognitive impairment. A concern remains that cumulative anesthetic exposures which 
occur later in life (e.g., after age 60) may increase the risk for MCI.

a1,467 individuals underwent 4,976 surgeries or procedures after the age of 40, but prior to the development of MCI or last follow-up visit. The 
data presented correspond to the number (%) of individuals who underwent at least one surgery in the given category (i.e., patients who underwent 
multiple surgeries of the same type are counted only once). For this reason, the sum across categories does not equal the total number of surgeries

Hazard ratios (HR) and P-values are from proportional hazards regression with surgical anesthesia exposure analyzed using time dependent variables. HR greater than 1 indicates an increased risk for 
developing MCI. Separate models were used to assess anesthesia exposure quantified as any anesthetic, number of exposures (0, 1, 2-3, ≥4) and cumulative duration of exposure in minutes. In all cases the 
model includes sex, education, marital status, smoking status, alcohol, APOE ε4 genotype, midlife diabetes, midlife hypertension, midlife dyslipidemia, atrial fibrillation, history of congestive heart failure, 
stroke, and coronary artery disease as covariates.
aSince anesthesia exposure was analyzed using a time-dependent covariate the number of participants in the various exposure categories differs over the duration of follow-up. If the 1731 participants were 
defined according to the maximum number of exposures they experienced, the number with 0, 1, 2-3 and ≥4 exposures was 264, 333, 604 and 530 after the age of 40; 436, 444 and 560, 291 after the age of 
60; 409, 471, 573, and 278 during a prior 20 year interval; 623, 515, 442 and 151 during a prior 10 year interval; and 839, 513, 309 and 70 during a prior 5 year interval.
bWhen cumulative duration of anesthesia is analyzed the HR is for a 60-min increase.
