IMPORTANCE A higher out-of-pocket price for mental health care may lead not only to cost
savings but also to negative downstream consequences.
OBJECTIVE To examine the association of higher patient cost sharing with mental health care
use and downstream effects, such as involuntary commitment and acute mental health care
use.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This difference-in-differences study compared changes
in mental health care use by adults, who experienced an increase in cost sharing, with
changes in youths, who did not experience the increase and thus formed a control group. The
study examined all 2 780 558 treatment records opened from January 1, 2010, through
December 31, 2012, by 110 organizations that provide specialist mental health care in the
Netherlands. Data analysis was performed from January 18, 2016, to May 9, 2017.
EXPOSURES On January 1, 2012, the Dutch national government increased the out-of-pocket
price of mental health services for adults by up to €200 (US$226) per year for outpatient
treatment and €150 (US$169) per month for inpatient treatment.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The number of treatment records opened each day in
regular specialist mental health care, involuntary commitment, and acute mental health care,
and annual specialist mental health care spending.
RESULTS This study included 1 448 541 treatment records opened from 2010 to 2012 (mean
[SD] age, 41.4 [16.7] years; 712 999 men and 735 542 women). The number of regular mental
health care records opened for adults decreased abruptly and persistently by 13.4% (95% CI,
−16.0% to −10.8%; P < .001) per day when cost sharing was increased in 2012. The decrease
was substantial and significant for severe and mild disorders and larger in low-income than in
high-income neighborhoods. Simultaneously, in 2012, daily record openings increased for
involuntary commitment by 96.8% (95% CI, 87.7%-105.9%; P < .001) and for acute mental
health care by 25.1% (95% CI, 20.8%-29.4%; P < .001). In contrast to our findings for adults,
the use of regular care among youths increased slightly and the use of involuntary
commitment and acute care decreased slightly after the reform. Overall, the cost-sharing
reform was associated with estimated savings of €13.4 million (US$15.1 million). However, for
adults with psychotic disorder or bipolar disorder, the additional costs of involuntary
commitment and acute mental health care exceeded savings by €25.5 million (US$28.8
million).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Higher cost sharing for seriously ill and low-income patients
could discourage treatment of vulnerable populations and create substantial downstream
costs.

 P
atient cost sharing lowers health care spending be-
cause individuals tend to use fewer health services
when they are required to pay a portion of the cost com-
pared with full insurance.1,2 It has been argued in the health
insurance literature that, if demand for certain health ser-
vices is highly responsive to price changes, patients do not de-
rive high value from those services.3,4 Because the demand for
mental health services is highly responsive to price changes,
some researchers have argued that there is an efficiency ra-
tionale for higher cost sharing for mental health care.5
However, empirical work suggests that patients subject to
cost sharing reduce their use of not only low-value but also
high-valuecare.6,7Forcertainillnesses,highercostsharingmay
lead to undesirable consequences, potentially with down-
stream costs that more than offset the policy’s savings.8,9 For
the patient, these broadly defined costs could include worse
healthfromforgonetreatmentandthedisutilityofusingdown-
stream services relative to regular services. For society, these
costs could include the greater expense of providing down-
streamservicestopatientsinworsehealth.Theliteratureraises
several questions. Does the negative association between
highercostsharingandtheuseofmentalhealthcarevarybased
on observable patient characteristics? Is the reduced use of
mental health care associated with an increase in down-
stream costs to the patient or society? If so, should cost
sharing for certain patients be lower than for others?
We investigated these questions using a quasi-
experimental study design in the Netherlands, where manda-
tory cost sharing for specialist mental health (including sub-
stance use) services was increased and a unique data set of
treatment records for 87% of all specialist mental health pa-
tients from 2010 to 2012 was available. Our study assessed
whether, after the reform, fewer adult patients received out-
patient or inpatient treatment by income and major diagno-
siscategory,includingtheseriouslyill,whomaybenefitgreatly
from treatment.10 Because youths did not face the cost-
sharingreform,theyformedanaturalunaffectedcontrolgroup
to examine the influence of the cost-sharing reform on adult
use of mental health services. Next, we investigated whether
the reform was associated with greater involuntary commit-
ment or acute mental health care use among adults and
whether the resulting costs were outweighed by the savings
from reduced regular care for each of the major diagnosis
categories.
Methods
Setting
The Netherlands has a long history of universal health insur-
ance with comprehensive coverage,11 low out-of-pocket
expenditures,12 and premium subsidies for low-income indi-
viduals. Before 2012, the single health care–wide annual de-
ductible, which applied to total costs summed across all types
ofspecialisthealthcare,hadnotbeenmorethan€170(US$192).
However, to combat increasing mental health care costs, the
Dutch national government increased the out-of-pocket price
for outpatient and inpatient specialist mental health care ef-
fectiveJanuary1,2012.Foroutpatientcare,adultpatientswere
required to pay €100 (US$113) out of pocket to open a treat-
ment record and an additional €100 (US$113) if they received
a total of more than 100 minutes of care during that treat-
ment record. For inpatient care, adult patients were required
to pay a monthly co-pay of €150 (US$169). We therefore ex-
amined whether a higher out-of-pocket price for mental health
care led to savings and negative downstream consequences.
The data were deidentified before we obtained them, and the
project was determined not human subjects research by Har-
vard's institutional review board. For these reasons, ethics ap-
proval was not required for this study.
A mental health treatment record worked as follows. The
physician opened a treatment record when the patient started
treatment, and a single treatment record covered all of the pa-
tient’s care for up to 365 days after the date that the record was
opened. However, all treatment records automatically closed
after 365 days; to continue treatment, a patient then had to
open a new treatment record. Consequently, patients were af-
fectedbythepostreformout-of-pocketpricesifandonlyiftheir
treatment record was opened in 2012.
The reform applied to all adults irrespective of their in-
come but did not apply to youths (those 17 years or younger
onthedatewhenatreatmentrecordwasopened),didnotaffect
the out-of-pocket price for medication or primary care, and did
not apply to involuntary commitment or acute mental health
care. Involuntary commitment occurred when a civil court of
justice committed unwilling patients who presented a threat
to themselves or others in accordance with the Law on Spe-
cial Admissions in Psychiatric Hospitals. Acute mental health
care, which was on a voluntary basis and could last no more
than 28 days, was care offered only to individuals who re-
quired immediate treatment because they posed a threat to
themselves or caused a public nuisance.13 Because the com-
mitment procedure was involuntary and acute care could only
last a short duration, involuntary commitment and acute care
were unlikely to be substitutes for individuals who wanted to
circumvent the postreform increase in the out-of-pocket price
of regular care. See eMethods in the Supplement for addi-
tional institutional details.
Key Points
Questions Does higher patient cost sharing for mental health care
reduce use and, if so, increase downstream costs to the patient or
society?
Findings This study of 1 448 541 treatment records in the
Netherlands found that a national reform that increased cost
sharing led to reduced use of mental health care for severe and
mild disorders, especially in low-income neighborhoods. Overall,
this reduced use created net savings, but for patients with
psychotic disorder or bipolar disorder, the reform was associated
with costly increases in involuntary commitment and acute mental
health care.
Meaning Higher cost sharing for seriously ill patients could create
substantial downstream costs.

 Measure of Use and Data Source
The cost-sharing reform primarily affected an individual’s de-
cision to open a treatment record as opposed to how much
treatment to seek during a treatment record. Therefore, we
measured mental health care use by the number of treatment
records that were opened each day. Our data consisted of all
individual-level, administrative mental health treatment rec-
ords from all 110 member organizations of the Dutch associa-
tion for mental health service providers (GGZ-NL) from Janu-
ary 1, 2010, through December 31, 2012. Data analysis was
performed from January 18, 2016, to May 9, 2017. Members of
GGZ-NL treated 87% of all specialist mental health records in
the Netherlands during the observation period. The remain-
ing 13% of records had a relatively low degree of complexity
and were treated by small organizations. For each treatment
record,weobservedthefollowing:patientsexandyearofbirth,
the start and end date of the record, the type of treatment,
whether the patient received any acute mental health care dur-
ing the record, one DSM-IV–based primary diagnosis code, the
number of inpatient and outpatient treatment minutes, and
the 4-digit postal code of the patient’s residence.
Study Population
We separated adults, those who turned 19 years or older in the
year that they opened a treatment record and were thus af-
fectedbythereform,fromyouths,thosewhoturned15through
17 years old and thus formed a control group that was unaf-
fected by the reform. We observed year of birth rather than the
exact date of birth; thus, we measured a patient’s age by sub-
tracting the patient’s birth year from the year when the pa-
tient’s treatment record was opened. We could not determine
whether individuals aged 18 years according to our measure
were in fact 18 years of age (ie, affected by the reform if they
started treatment in 2012) or 17 years of age (ie, youths unaf-
fected by the reform) on the date when their treatment rec-
ord was opened. For this reason, we excluded individuals aged
18 years from the analysis (eMethods in the Supplement). We
also excluded those whom we measured as 14 years or younger
to make our youth sample more comparable to the adult
sample. For adults and youths, we created 3 mutually exclu-
sive samples: a regular treatment sample, a sample with the
involuntary commitment records, and a sample with the acute
treatment records (eMethods in the Supplement).

 From the recorded primary diagnosis, we classified each
treatment record into 1 of 9 major diagnosis categories
(eMethods and eTable 1 in the Supplement). This classification
allowed us to compare our results for disorders that are consid-
ered to be on average more severe, such as psychotic disorder,
personality disorder, or bipolar disorder, with those consid-
ered to be on average less severe, such as anxiety disorder or
depressivedisorder.Toassigneachpatienttoanincomedecile,
we linked the postal code of a patient’s residence to the mean
household income in 2012 for that postal code14 and the num-
berofinhabitantsin2011forthatpostalcode15(eMethodsinthe
Supplement).Tocalculatecostsforeachrecord,weusedthena-
tional tariff schedule for mental health insurance claims16 and
an estimate for the additional procedural costs per record for
involuntary commitment17 (eMethods in the Supplement).
Statistical Analysis
We used ordinary least squares regression models to esti-
mate the association of the cost-sharing reform with mental
health care use, involuntary commitment, and acute care. For
each sample, our units of observation were the calendar days
from January 1, 2010, through December 31, 2012. The depen-
dentvariablewasthenumberoftreatmentrecordsopenedthat
day as a fraction of the mean number of treatment records
opened per day in 2011. The independent variable of interest
was an indicator for openings in 2012, and its coefficient mea-
sured the percentage change in daily openings between 2011
and 2012. This model controlled for openings in 2010, day of
the week, and day of the year (eMethods in the Supplement).
To investigate whether factors other than the reform were re-
sponsible for changes in use, we estimated a difference-in-
differences model on the pooled sample of regular treatment
records opened for adults and youths.18 This model con-
tained interactions between all covariates from the baseline
model and an indicator variable for being in the adult rather
than the youth sample (eMethods in the Supplement).
Forourfigures,weobtainedresidualsfromregressionsthat
controlled for day of the week, day of the year, and holidays
to separate structural changes from seasonal patterns. After
adding the mean daily openings in 2011 to these residuals, we
plotted these mean-shifted residuals to show detrended daily
openings across the 3 years (eMethods in the Supplement). We
calculated P values using a 2-sided t test. Because we tested
multiple hypotheses, P < .002 was considered to be statisti-

Results
Characteristics of Treatment Records
This study included 1 448 541 treatment records of adults and
youths opened from 2010 to 2012 (mean [SD] age, 41.4 [16.7]
years; 712 999 men and 735 542 women). Table 1 provides the
annual number of treatment records opened for the adult
sample in regular care and a comparison of those records by
observed characteristics (additional discussion of these char-
acteristics is available in eResults in the Supplement). The raw
growth rate of 3.9% from 2010 to 2011 was consistent with the
mean annual growth rate of 5.6% in treatment between 2004
and2010.19,20Bycontrast,therawdecreaseof14.8%from2011
to 2012 departed significantly from the prior annual trends
(eFigure in the Supplement).
In addition, Table 1 provides the total annual number of
treatment records opened for involuntary civil commitment
andforacutecareintheadultsample.Ofthepatientswhowere
committed involuntarily, 63.7% were diagnosed with psy-
chotic disorder and 12.6% with bipolar disorder. The median
duration of an acute treatment record was 5 days (interquar-
tilerange,2-17days),and64.2%ofpatientswhoreceivedacute
care had treatment records with a missing primary diagnosis
(providers were not required to report a diagnosis on treat-
ment records for acute care).
Incontrasttoourfindingsforadults,theuseofregularcare
among youths increased slightly and the use of involuntary
commitment and acute care decreased slightly after the re-
form (eTable 2 in the Supplement).
Use and Downstream Effects
Conditionaloncovariates,thenumberofdailyopeningsofregu-
lar treatment records among adults decreased persistently by
13.4% (95% CI, −16.0% to −10.8%; P < .001) when the cost-
sharing reform was introduced on January 1, 2012 (Figure 1A,
Table 2, and eTable 3 in the Supplement). In contrast, the num-
ber of daily openings of regular treatment records in the con-
trolgroupofunaffectedyouthsincreasedslightly(Figure1Band
eTable 4 and eTable 5 in the Supplement). Our difference-in-
differences model, which included adults and youths, yielded
anestimateof−15.4%(95%CI,−18.5%to−12.3%;P < .001).This
finding of reduced use remained significant when we ac-
counted for the possibility that individuals may have antici-
pated the reform (eResults in the Supplement).

HeterogeneitybyNeighborhoodIncomeandMajorDiagnosis
Figure 2A shows the overlaid residual plots for each of the 10
income deciles. Before the reform, treatment rates in the poor-
est decile had been 2.7 times higher than those in the richest
decile. The reduction in the demand for treatment was
significantly greater in poorer neighborhoods than in richer
neighborhoods (Table 2 and eTable 6 in the Supplement).
Figure 2B shows the overlaid residual plots for the 5 ma-
jor diagnoses with the greatest number of treatment records.
Overall, the demand response was statistically significant for
all major diagnosis categories (Table 2 and eTable 7 in the
Supplement). The number of records opened each day for pa-
tients with psychotic disorder decreased by 10.6% (95% CI,
−14.5% to −6.7%; P < .001), which was not much smaller than
the estimated effect for patients with depressive disorder
(−13.8%; 95% CI, −17.1% to −10.4%; P < .001) or anxiety disor-
der (−13.1%; 95% CI, −16.2% to −10.0%; P < .001).
Figure 2C shows that the increase in involuntary commit-
ment after the reform was driven primarily by patients diag-
nosed with psychotic disorder and, to a lesser extent, by
patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Figure 2D shows that
the increase in acute care after the reform was driven by pa-
tients whose diagnoses were recorded as missing.

 and acute care increased by 5066, which generated total costs
of €57.0 million (US$64.3 million). Consequently, the reform
saved an estimated €13.4 million (US$15.1 million) more than
it cost. Net savings were largest for depressive disorder at €15.3
million (US$17.3 million) and anxiety disorder at €9.8 million
(US$11.1 million). However, net savings were negative for psy-
chotic disorder at −€19.5 million (−US$22.0 million) and bi-
polar disorder at −€6.0 million (−US$6.8 million).
Discussion
After 8 years of increases, the number of mental health treat-
ment records opened by adults in the Netherlands decreased
when cost sharing for mental health care increased in 2012.
The size of this decrease was significant for severe and mild
disorders and larger in low-income than in high-income neigh-
borhoods. Simultaneously, among adults, involuntary com-
mitment almost doubled and acute mental health care in-
creased by 25% between 2011 and 2012. On aggregate, the
reform was associated with estimated net savings in treat-
ment costs of €13.4 million (US$15.1 million). However, for in-
dividuals with psychotic disorder or bipolar disorder, the ad-
ditional costs for involuntary commitment and acute care
exceeded savings by €25.5 million (US$28.8 million) because
of fewer patients in regular care.
Our study is the first, to our knowledge, to investigate the
influence of a patient cost-sharing reform for specialist men-
tal health care only and to evaluate the consequences for pa-
tients across an entire country. Our empirical strategy is com-
parable to recent evaluations of cost-sharing reforms in
Massachusetts21,22 and California9 and of the increase in the
deductible of health insurance plans offered by a large US em-
ployer to its employees.6 Our research design has several ad-
vantages. First, our setting provided variation in mental health
insurance coverage that was plausibly unrelated to other fac-
tors. Second, our estimates were based on observed behavior
in response to a real-world policy change. Third, our data al-
lowed us to obtain statistically precise estimates for hetero-
geneous effects based on patient characteristics of down-
stream costs as measured by types of treatment.
Our findings contribute to the health care literature and
are relevant for policy makers. Because of the large increase
in involuntary commitment and acute mental health care, it
appears that at least some patients stopped regular treatment
even though it was of high value. Optimal policy requires de-
signing a system that incentivizes patients to use services for
which the clinical and nonclinical benefits exceed monetary
andnonmonetarycostsandtoforgoservicesforwhichtheben-
efits do not justify the cost. Our results do not rule out that
higher cost sharing incentivized certain individuals to reduce
low-value care. However, the downstream costs that we ob-
served for patients with psychotic disorder and bipolar disor-
derareanexampleofhowcostsharingcanincreaseratherthan
decrease total spending for certain populations.
Although the institutional context in the United States dif-
fers substantially from that in the Netherlands, where out-of-
pocket maximums are lower on average, these results can
inform the current US cost-sharing debate. The United
States has seen an increase in the number of insured indi-
viduals after the implementation of the Patient Protection
and Affordable Care Act, as well as a reduction in the cover-
age gap between mental health care and other health ser-
vices since the 1980s23 in large part because of parity
legislation.24 However, average cost sharing for health ser-
vices has increased among those with private health
insurance.25,26 Furthermore, public policy seems to be
headed toward less rather than more coverage. Our study
suggests that reducing coverage for mental health care can
lower mental health care costs overall but may have nega-
tive unintended consequences for the seriously ill.
Limitations

influenced the use of mental health care at the time of the re-
form. However, we found no macroeconomic shocks, demo-
graphic shifts, or policy changes around January 1, 2012, that

To control for any remaining factors, we relied on our differ-
ence-in-differences model, which used a sample of youths to
construct counterfactual trends, and the results were consis-
tent with the baseline estimates. Second, we could not link
treatment records for individuals across time to identify
the characteristics of those individuals who discontinued
treatment after the reform. Third, we were unable to investi-
gate whether, after the reform, patients substituted away from

on primary care use suggests that patients did not substitute
toward primary care after the reform (eDiscussion in the
Supplement). Fourth, we could not link treatment records to
additional individual outcomes, and therefore were unable to
assess the downstream costs of the policy on other medical
costs or on other sectors of the economy in which the burden
of untreated illness may be significant, such as the labor mar-
ket and the criminal justice system.27,28
Conclusions
Using data from the Netherlands, we examined the associa-
tion of a national cost-sharing reform with mental health care
use and downstream costs. A higher out-of-pocket price was
associated with reduced use of mental health care, which gen-
erated aggregate savings but also increased costly use of in-
voluntary commitment and acute care, particularly among in-
dividuals with psychotic disorder or bipolar disorder.
