Abstract
Aims—To test, among US students: 1) whether perceived harmfulness of marijuana has changed 
over time, 2) whether perceived harmfulness of marijuana changed post-passage of state medical 
marijuana laws (MML) compared with pre-passage; 3) whether perceived harmfulness of 
marijuana mediates and/or modifies the relation between MML and marijuana use as a function of 
grade level.
Design—Cross-sectional nationally-representative surveys of U.S. students, conducted annually, 
1991–2014, in the Monitoring The Future study.
Setting—Surveys conducted in schools in all coterminous states; 21 states passed MML between 
1996–2014.
Participants—The sample included 1,134,734 adolescents in 8th, 10th, and 12th grades.

 Measures—State passage of MML; perceived harmfulness of marijuana use (perceiving great or 
moderate risk to health from smoking marijuana occasionally versus slight or no risk); and 
marijuana use (prior 30 days). Data were analyzed using time-varying multi-level regression 
modeling.
Findings—Perceived harmfulness of marijuana significantly decreased since 1991 (from an 
estimated 84.0% in 1991 to 53.8% in 2014, p<0.01). Across time, perceived harmfulness was 
lower in states that passed MML (OR=0.86, 95% C.I. 0.75–0.97). In states with MML, perceived 
harmfulness of marijuana increased among 8th graders after MML passage (OR=1.21, 95% C.I. 
1.08–1.36), while marijuana use decreased (OR=0.81, 95% C.I. 0.72–0.92). Results were null for 
other grades, and for all grades combined. Increases in perceived harmfulness among 8th graders 
after MML passage was associated with ~33% of the decrease in use. When adolescents were 
stratified by perceived harmfulness, use in 8th graders decreased to a greater extent among those 
who perceived marijuana as harmful.
Conclusions—While perceived harmfulness of marijuana use is decreasing nationally among 
adolescents, passage of medical marijuana laws is associated with increases in perceived 
harmfulness among young adolescents, and marijuana use decreased among those who perceive 
marijuana to be harmful after passage of MML.
Introduction
Marijuana use policy is undergoing substantial changes worldwide to include provisions for 
medical use. In the United States, since 1996, 23 states have legalized medical use of 
marijuana in some form, and as of 2015, four states have also legalized recreational use for 
adults. These changes have stimulated substantial discussion about potential unintended 
consequences of the laws. In particular, commentators have posited that more permissive 
marijuana legislation may lead to greater marijuana use among adolescents (1–6), an age 
group of particular concern because neurobiology develops rapidly during adolescence (7–
9), and heavy marijuana use during this critical period is posited to have long-lasting adverse 
effects (10–12).
Studies show that in states with MMLs, adolescents and adults have higher rates of 
marijuana use than in other states (13–15). However, most studies that compare adolescents 
surveyed in states pre- and post-MML passage show no post-MML increase (16–19), save 
for a recent study demonstrating a potential increase in marijuana initiation (20). Among 
adults, evidence is mixed for state-level MML effects across a variety of outcomes (20–29). 
Large-scale pre-/post-comparisons of marijuana use while taking into account other secular 
changes and state-level differences face substantial methodological challenges, suggesting 
that a fruitful approach to understanding the link, or lack of one, between adolescent 
marijuana use and MML may be to investigate mechanisms that might explain the 
relationship between MML and changes in marijuana use.
One suggested partial mechanism for an association between MML and marijuana use is 
through changes in the perception of marijuana use; MML passage has been postulated to 
decrease the perception of harm of marijuana use. If so, such changes in perceptions might 
set the stage for subsequent increases in use, since changes in attitudes can be short-term

 indicators of future behavior change (30). Public perceptions of the harms associated with 
marijuana use have varied considerably over time (31, 32) and such variations are 
consistently associated with changes in the prevalence of marijuana use (30, 33, 34). 
Descriptively, data from the yearly U.S. national Monitoring the Future surveys indicate that 
perceived harmfulness of marijuana has declined among adolescents since 2007–2009 (35), 
but differences between states with and without MMLs in the perceived harm due to 
marijuana use have not been tested. In Colorado, following a number of policy changes in a 
state that had had MML for several years, the proportion of middle- and high school students 
perceiving marijuana to be a great harm decreased from 2011 to 2013, as did the prevalence 
of marijuana use (36). In sum, examination of perceptions of the harmfulness of marijuana 
after passage of MML may provide insights into potential mechanisms through which MML 
may affect public health. Few studies have had sufficient data to address potential pre-post 
MML effects on perceptions of marijuana harmfulness, or how such perceptions mediate the 
relationship between MML and marijuana use.
Previously, using Monitoring the Future data, we reported that the passage of medical 
marijuana laws was not associated with post-MML increases in state-level adolescent 
marijuana use (results even suggested a post-MML decline in use among 8th grade students) 
(14). However, given the complex interplay between policies/laws, public attitudes, and drug 
use, we now examine the role that adolescent perception of the harmfulness of marijuana 
plays in the relationship between MML passage and subsequent changes in adolescent 
marijuana use. We utilized national Monitoring the Future (MTF) data from 1991 to 2014 to 
investigate the following: 1) whether perceived harmfulness of marijuana has changed over 
time, 2) whether perceived harmfulness of marijuana changed post-passage of state MML 
compared with pre-passage; 3) whether perceived harmfulness of marijuana partially 
mediates and/or modifies the relation between MML and marijuana use among 8th grade 
students. Following our previous research (14), we assess these associations both in the 
overall sample and by grade. Marijuana use and attitudes change substantially across stages 
of adolescent development (37), and our previous findings indicate that MML passage is 
associated with decreased use among 8th grade students.
Methods
Sample
MTF studies include yearly cross-sectional surveys of 8th, 10th and 12th grade students, 
sampled to be nationally representative (35). Approximately 400 schools are surveyed each 
year in the 48 coterminous U.S. states; students are assessed with self-administered 
questionnaires. We included data collected since 1991, the first year all three grades were 
included. The study employs a multi-stage random sampling design with school replacement 
upon refusal. Up to 350 students per grade are included; only one grade (8, 10 or 12) is 
surveyed per school. Schools typically participate for two years. Non-participating schools 
are replaced with others closely matched on geographic location, size, and urbanicity. Of all 
selection sample units, 95%–99% obtained one or more participating school in all study 
years; lack of a time trend in school participation rates (38) suggests limited influence of 
school nonresponse on trend data.

 Approximately 15,000 students are included in the total sample per grade per year, totaling 
1,134,734 students in the 48 states through 2014. Student response rates were 81%–91% for 
all years and grades. Most non-response was due to absenteeism; <1% refused. Consistency 
in data collection procedures was strictly maintained over the years. Parents and students 
received advance information about the study, including that participation was voluntary and 
responses anonymous (8th, 10th grade) or confidential (12th grade). Students completed 
questionnaires in classrooms or larger group administrations. After excluding students 
missing marijuana use or perceived harm, 973,089 (90.5%) remained for analysis: 363,539 
8th graders (88.9%); 336,420 10th graders (90.8%) and 273,130 12th graders (92.2%). Small 
differences were found in demographics comparing those with data to those with missing 
data, such that those with data were more likely to be: female, white versus non-white, 
younger age, and higher parental education.
Measures
Past 30-day marijuana use—Our main marijuana use variable was a dichotomous use 
variable, consistent with previous studies in time-trend analysis (30, 39), consisting of any 
marijuana use (vs. no use) within the prior 30 days. We also conducted sensitivity analyses 
using a graded response option (0, 1–2, 3–5, through a maximum of 40+ occasions of use). 
The validity of MTF substance reports is supported by low question non-response; the high 
proportion of participants reporting illicit drug use; strong evidence of construct validity; 
and methodological studies using objective validation methods (38).
Perceived harm of marijuana use—Students are asked “How much do you think 
people risk harming themselves (physically or in other ways), if they smoke marijuana 
occasionally?” Response options included “No risk”, “Slight risk”, “Moderate risk”, “Great 
risk”, and “Can’t say, drug unfamiliar”. We dichotomized the item into those who perceived 
“Great risk” or “moderate risk” versus “No risk” or “Slight risk” (“can’t say” was 
considered missing data), enabling us to model the prevalence of those who perceived 
marijuana to be harmful versus all others. We also conducted sensitivity analyses using the 
item: “How much do you think people risk harming themselves if they smoke marijuana 
regularly, dichotomizing the variables similarly as great or moderate risk vs. all others.
Medical marijuana laws (MML)—Two MML indicators were used. The first was a state-
level binary variable indicating if a state ever passed a MML by 2014, regardless of the year 
it was passed. This variable was used to compare prevalence of marijuana use between 
adolescents living in states that ever passed a MML and in states that did not. The second 
was a time-varying state-level binary MML variable for each year (1991–2014) and state 
indicating whether the state had a MML during that year or not. This enabled us to examine 
adolescents within states prior to and after passage of a MML. Years in which states were 
considered to have passed MML are listed in Online Table 1. We also conducted sensitivity 
analyses by re-categorizing the MML variable according to whether the state medical 
marijuana law implicitly permitted dispensing via caregivers and amounts per patient, or 
explicitly acknowledged dispensaries as either permitted or not declared illegal (coding 
consistent with our previous publication on MMLs (14)); years are also listed in Online 
Table 1.

 School- and state-level covariates—School-level control variables included number of 
students per grade within school; public vs. private school; and urban/suburban vs. rural 
(school located within a Metropolitan Statistical Area or not (40)). State-level control 
variables included the proportion of the population in each state that was male, white, aged 
10–24, and aged >25 years without high school education based on census data.
Individual covariates—These included age, gender, race/ethnicity (self-defined: White, 
Black, Hispanic, Asian, Mixed, Other), and highest parental education.
Statistical analysis—First, we modeled the prevalence of perceived harmfulness of 
marijuana use (great or moderate harm), by year, grade, and by state MML status using a 
multilevel logistic regression model with adolescents nested within states. The model 
included perceived harmfulness of marijuana use as the outcome, and the state-level MML 
predictors, individual-, school-, and state-level covariates and a piecewise cubic spline to 
smoothly control the nonlinear historical trend across 24 years (fixed at overall US 
distributions for prevalence estimates). Because states passed MML in different years, 
adjusted prevalence estimates for each year scaled the modeled pre-post change effect by the 
cumulative proportion of the US population exposed to MML in that particular year, 
following procedures detailed previously (14). Not all states have MTF data available for 
every year and grade; the multilevel model addresses this by smoothing associations across 
missing years and grades with state-level random effects. Details of our modeling strategy as 
well as model code for SAS 9.4 can be found in an online supplement to this paper.
Second, we used the same multilevel logistic regression model with perceived harmfulness 
of marijuana use as the outcome to examine the odds of change in perception of harmfulness 
after passage of MML compared to prior to MML passage. We estimated the overall effect 
of living in a state that ever passes an MML, and a pre-post effect, i.e., a time-varying 
difference-in-difference estimate of the change in adolescent attitudes after the law was 
passed.
Third, we used a similar multilevel regression modeling, with past 30-day marijuana use as 
the outcome, to address whether the estimate of past-30 day marijuana use changed after 
passage of MML, controlling for perceived harmfulness of marijuana use. Baseline 
probabilities of marijuana use across time are provided in a previous publication of these 
data (14). Proportion of the total effect of pre-post change on MML use mediated by 
changes in perceived harm were also estimated on the log odds ratio scale, using the 
approach of Vanderweele (41). Multiplicative interactions of perceived harmfulness by 
MML were tested, and estimates were generated by perceived harmfulness from the model 
with interaction terms included. Estimates of the association between MML and use by 
perceived harmfulness by state were also extracted.
Three sensitivity analyses were also conducted in selected analyses. First, we examined 
perceived harmfulness of “regular use” in place of the primary “occasional use” variable. 
Second, we examined an ordinal indicator of marijuana use in the past 30 days (number of 
occasions) in place of the any use vs. none variable. Third, we examined dispensary effects 
using an alternative three-level MML definition: states with MML and implicit or explicit

 provision for marijuana dispensaries (as defined above); states with MML and no provision 
for dispensaries, and states with no MML.
Results
Figure 1 shows the prevalence of perceived harmfulness of marijuana use, by grade, 
stratified by state MML status. Overall, perceived harmfulness decreased across time, and 
was lower among those in MML states than in non-MML states, especially in 10th and 12th 
grade.
Are state-level MML associated with changes in adolescent perceived harmfulness of 
marijuana?
As shown in Table 1, pre- versus post-MML analyses indicated among 8th graders, perceived 
harmfulness significantly increased post-MML passage (OR=1.21, 95% C.I. 1.08–1.36); 
perceived harmfulness did not change significantly post-MML passage among 10th and 12th 
graders. Not shown, adolescents in states that ever pass an MML were less likely to perceive 
marijuana as harmful both overall (OR=0.86, 95% C.I. 0.75–0.97) and within each grade.
Does perceived harmfulness mediate state-level MML effects on adolescent marijuana 
use?
The association between state-level MML and marijuana use, adjusted for perceived 
harmfulness, is shown in Table 2.
Controlling for perceived harmfulness, MML passage was significantly associated with 
lower post-MML marijuana use among 8th graders (OR=0.81, 95% C.I. 0.72–0.92), but not 
among 10th and 12th graders (Table 2).
Marijuana use was higher (OR=1.21, 95% C.I. 1.06–1.39) and perceived harmfulness lower 
(OR=0.1131, 95% C.I. 0.1114–0.1148) in states that ever passed an MML versus states that 
did not in all grades combined, though there was no significant change in marijuana use after 
passage of MML in all grades combined.
The total association between pre-post change in the law and marijuana use among 8th 
graders was previously reported in these data as OR=0.73 (95% C.I. 0.63–0.84) (14). Hence, 
the proportion of this MML association on decreasing 8th grader use that was associated 
with changes in the perception that marijuana is harmful was 33% on the log odds scale 
(log(0.73)–log(0.81))/log(0.73).
Do state-level MMLs have a differential effect on adolescent marijuana use depending on 
its perceived harmfulness?
We then considered whether there was evidence that the association between MMLs and 
marijuana use differs depending on whether the individual adolescent perceived marijuana 
use to be harmful (Table 3). The interaction of grade by law effect by perceived harmfulness 
was statistically significant for 8th graders (Online Table 2, p=0.046), indicating that 
perceived harmfulness of marijuana significantly modified the relationship between MML 
passage and 8th grade marijuana use.

 As shown in Table 3, among those who perceived marijuana use to be harmful, marijuana 
use decreased post-MML (OR=0.76, 95% C.I. 0.66, 0.87); among those who did not 
perceive marijuana to be harmful, marijuana use marijuana use also decreased post-MML 
(OR=0.84, 95% C.I. 0.73–0.95), but the effect of MML passage was stronger among those 
who perceive marijuana use to be harmful. Online Figure 1 shows the state-by-state effects, 
which demonstrate some variability across state, though results are generally consistent with 
those in the pooled state analysis.
Sensitivity analyses
First (Online Table 3), we examined perceived harmfulness of regular (rather than 
occasional) use. In this analysis, MML passage was associated with lower likelihood of 
marijuana use only among 8th graders who perceive marijuana use to be harmful (OR=0.76, 
95% C.I. 0.65, 0.88).
Second (Online Table 4), we examined marijuana use as an ordinal (rather than 
dichotomous) outcome. Among those who perceive marijuana use to be harmful, MML 
passage remains associated with decreases in occasions of marijuana use in 8th graders 
(p=0.008).
Third (Online Table 5), we used the three-level MML indicator that took dispensaries into 
account in place of the binary MML measure. Among 8th graders who perceive marijuana 
use to be harmful, marijuana use decreased both in states with an implicit or explicit 
dispensary allowance (OR=0.80, 95% C.I. 0.66–0.99) and among those in states without 
such an allowance (OR=0.77, 95% C.I. 0.63–0.95).
Discussion
Since 1991, perceived harmfulness of marijuana use has decreased among U.S. adolescents. 
However, among 8th grade students, in states with MML compared to those without, 
perceived harmfulness increased after MML were passed, a result contrary to the overall 
national time trend. These findings indicate that in a national landscape of decreasing 
perceived harmfulness, young adolescents in states that pass MML have a lower overall 
decrease in perceived harmfulness than adolescents in states without MML. Given that 
perceived harmfulness of marijuana is strongly associated with less use of marijuana, this 
indicates that over time, young adolescents in MML states could be expected to be less 
likely to use marijuana than adolescents in those states pre-passage. In fact, the findings are 
consistent with perceived harmfulness mediating approximately one-third of the decrease in 
marijuana use among 8th graders previously observed in these data after passage of MML 
(14). Further, the association between state-level MML passage and decreased marijuana use 
in 8th grade was stronger among those who perceive marijuana to be harmful to health. 
These associations were robust to multiple sensitivity analyses.
State-level MML associations with marijuana use and perceived harmfulness were found 
among 8th graders, but not 10th or 12th graders, therefore constituting a robust age effect. 
After passage of medical marijuana laws, these young adolescents (for whom attitudes may 
be malleable compared to older adolescents who have already formed opinions) may decide

 that marijuana is something for use by individuals who are sick, which would make 
marijuana use seem less appealing as a fun or recreational activity. Also, within-state media 
coverage of potential harms associated with marijuana use may increase around the time that 
MML are passed, potentially influencing the post-MML opinion of young adolescents. This 
could have a greater effect on 8th graders, who are generally not yet in high school and 
therefore have more limited exposure to recreational marijuana use (35) than on 10th and 
12th grade high school students. In addition, parents may be attuned to messages their 
younger teens hear and provide more counter-marijuana messages to them than to older 
teens. To our knowledge, public health education, conversations, and controversies around 
MML passage have not targeted young adolescents, suggesting that policy and funding at a 
state level do not explain these findings; rather, we speculate that the mechanisms 
underlying these results arise from developmental differences in the way that marijuana use 
is perceived and used among young adolescents. Further investigation of age differences in 
the adolescent understanding of peer and media marijuana messages is an important future 
direction indicated by this research.
We note that approximately one third of the decrease in marijuana use after passage of MML 
among 8th grade students is mediated by the change in attitudes towards marijuana. Thus, 
our results suggest that young adolescents in MML states are increasingly perceiving 
marijuana to be a risk to health, and that this perception at least in part mediates the 
decreasing marijuana use among adolescents in these states compared with non-MML states. 
However, we also note that two thirds of this decrease is unexplained, suggested that the 
diverse mechanisms including parental attitudes, availability, and peer and school influences 
should also be investigated, to the extent that they correlate with MML passage. To the 
extent that these factors also correlate with perceived harmfulness, further analyses may be 
able to tease apart more specific mechanisms.
Our understanding of the relationship between marijuana legal policy and marijuana use has 
been outpaced by the rapidity of the legal changes that have occurred, particularly over the 
last 10 years. To our knowledge, four main data sources have been used to examine the 
impact of medical marijuana laws on marijuana use: the National Household Survey on 
Drug Use and Health (13, 16, 20), the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance Survey (17–19), the 
National Longitudinal Study of Youth (19, 42), and Monitoring the Future (14). Other data 
sources have also examined outcomes such as treatment admissions and traffic fatalities (19, 
22, 27). Almost all studies have found little evidence of a change in adolescent marijuana 
use in states that passed MML. However, some studies have suggested positive associations 
when examining initiation (20) or when examining specific aspects of the laws rather than a 
broad comparison of any versus no MML (42). Our results did not find any overall positive 
effect of dispensaries. However, medical marijuana laws differ substantially in legal 
provisions across states (43), thus careful continued attention to these variations across states 
are critical. Further, MML passage is ongoing within the context of other marijuana 
legislation, including decriminalization and legalization of recreational use for adults, and 
marijuana policy is ongoing within a broader context of shifting economic conditions in the 
US and other substance use policy and taxation, which may also affect drug use. Continuing 
studies are needed to examine the effects of each of these policies and dynamic economic 
conditions conjointly.

 Study limitations are noted. The MTF was not originally designed to be representative of 
specific U.S. states. Thus, the number of schools included in each state in each year varies, 
and adolescents in the schools were not selected to be representative of the state overall. 
However, data are drawn from a very large sample across diverse geographic areas in the 48 
coterminous U.S. states, and thus the study is population-based. Further, additional specific 
variations in MML were not considered here, including permission for home cultivation, 
possession, and the illnesses approved; all merit examination in future studies. Timing of 
passage and implementation of laws as well as de facto operations change by state and 
across time (2, 42, 43), so determining the effects of laws already passed on future rates of 
marijuana use will require continued surveillance. Our mediation strategy provides an 
assessment of the overall proportion of the association between MML passage and 
marijuana use in 8th grade that is associated with changes in attitudes, but causal 
interpretation should be cautioned given the interaction between attitudes and MML passage 
in association with marijuana use. Further, adolescents reported on their attitude towards 
marijuana use and their use of marijuana at the same time, thus the longitudinal association 
between a change in attitude and a subsequent change is use cannot be disentangled; further 
analysis in longitudinal designs, should such data become available, would aid in more 
rigorously teasing apart the timing of attitude formation and changes in behavior. 
Additionally, our results cannot be generalized to adults, among whom rates of marijuana 
use access to medical marijuana differ.
In conclusion, the present study documents changed perception of the harmfulness of 
marijuana overall among adolescents since 1991, and further, differing directions of change 
among the youngest adolescents after state-level MML passage. The grade-specific effects 
are consistent with previous finding on use (14). This change in perception for 8th graders 
partially mediates the association between MML passage and a decrease in marijuana use. 
Because marijuana use during early adolescence predicts long-term adverse consequences 
(10, 11), gaining a better understanding of the relationship between laws, perceived 
harmfulness and use among the youngest adolescents is a critical research priority. As 
American marijuana legal policy regarding the manufacture, sale, possession, and use of 
marijuana continues to change, continued epidemiological surveillance is critical to monitor 
potential effect of the laws.

Notes: The “Pre-post change” is a pre-post test, it indicates the estimated change in adolescent attitudes after an MML is passed (in the states that 
passed MML from 1991 through 2014), OR > 1 indicates an increase in perceived harmfulness occurs after a law is passed as compared to before.
Model controlled for gender, age, race, parent education, class size, urban/rural, public/private, state-aggregated % male, % white, % with no high 
school education, % population aged 11–24. The model also included a state random intercept, and state-specific cubic spline polynomials to 
control for secular trends in all states with knots at the years 1998 and 2006.
+Based on survey question: “How much do you think people risk harming themselves (physically or in other ways) if they smoke marijuana 
occasionally?” Response options were dichotomized into “Great risk” and “Moderate risk” versus “slight risk”, and “no risk”.

Notes: “Living in a state that ever passes an MML versus never” is not a pre-post test. It indicates the odds of marijuana use among adolescents in 
states that ever pass an MML at any point from 1992 through 2014 compared to those in states that never pass a law over the same time period. The 
“Pre-post change” is a pre-post test, it indicates the estimated change in adolescent marijuana use after an MML is passed.
