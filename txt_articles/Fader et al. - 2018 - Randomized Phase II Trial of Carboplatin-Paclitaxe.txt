Purpose
Uterine serous carcinoma is a rare, aggressive variant of endometrial cancer. Trastuzumab is a hu-
manized monoclonal antibody that targets human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)/neu,
a receptor overexpressed in 30% of uterine serous carcinoma. This multicenter, randomized phase II
trial compared carboplatin-paclitaxel with and without trastuzumab in patients with advanced or re-
current uterine serous carcinoma who overexpress HER2/neu.
Methods
Eligible patients had primary stage III or IV or recurrent HER2/neu-positive disease. Participants were
randomly assigned to receive carboplatin-paclitaxel (control arm) for six cycles with or without
intravenous trastuzumab (experimental arm) until progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary
end point was progression-free survival, which was assessed for differences between treatment
arms via one-sided log-rank tests.
Results
From August 2011 to March 2017, 61 patients were randomly assigned. Forty progression-free
survival–related events occurred among 58 evaluable participants. Among all patients, median
progression-free survival was 8.0 months (control) versus 12.6 months (experimental; P = .005; hazard
ratio [HR], 0.44; 90% CI, 0.26 to 0.76). Similarly, median progression-free survival was 9.3 (control)
versus 17.9 (experimental) months among 41 patients with stage III or IV disease undergoing primary
treatment (P = .013; HR, 0.40; 90% CI, 0.20 to 0.80) and 6.0 (control) versus 9.2 months (experi-
mental), respectively, among 17 patients with recurrent disease (P = .003; HR, 0.14; 90% CI, 0.04 to
0.53). Toxicity was not different between treatment arms, and no unexpected safety signals emerged.
Conclusion
Addition of trastuzumab to carboplatin-paclitaxel was well tolerated and increased progression-free
survival. These encouraging results deserve further investigation to determine their impact on overall
survival in patients with advanced or recurrent uterine serous carcinoma who overexpress HER2/neu.

Endometrial cancer is the most common
gynecologic malignancy in the United States. In
2016, there were 60,050 cases and 10,470
deaths.1 Uterine serous carcinoma (USC) is an
aggressive variant first described in 1972.2 Al-
though only 3% to 10% of all cases, USC ac-
counts for a disproportionately high number of
endometrial cancer deaths (39%).3 As many as
37% to 70% of women diagnosed with this
subtype have extrauterine spread at diagnosis,4-6
contributing to poor outcomes compared with
women with the more prevalent endometrioid
endometrial adenocarcinoma.7-10 Five-year sur-
vival for women with USC is approximately 41%,
compared with 75% among women with grade 3
endometrioid tumors (P = .01),11 and recurrences
are difficult to salvage.12
In part because of its rarity, optimal man-
agement of USC is controversial and understudied.
USC is typically treated with hysterectomy and

 surgical staging followed by platinum plus taxane combination
chemotherapy.13-15 Existing evidence supports the benefit of
chemotherapy for treatment of USC, even in early-stage dis-
ease.12-15 Response rates to carboplatin-paclitaxel among pa-
tients with previously untreated advanced-stage disease may be as
low as 60%, and # 50% among those with recurrent disease.16
USC is molecularly distinct to endometrioid carcinoma.17,18
The mutational profile of USC consists of alterations in TP53 and
dysregulation of HER2/neu, in contrast to endometrioid cancers,
which demonstrate aberrant PTEN.18 Human epidermal growth
factor receptor 2 (HER2)/neu provides critical signaling for cancer
cell growth, survival, and proliferation, and its overexpression
occurs in 14% to 80% of USC.19-27 These estimates vary widely
because of a lack of standardized algorithms for interpretation and
scoring of HER2 immunostains in endometrial cancer.
Trastuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody against
HER2/neu. It was first approved by the Food and Drug Admin-
istration in 1998 for first-line treatment of metastatic breast cancer
with overexpression of HER2/neu either in combination with
paclitaxel or as a single agent in women who have received one or
more chemotherapy regimens. It has since been approved in
combination with capecitabine and fluorouracil for HER2/neu-
overexpressing gastric adenocarcinomas. In GOG-181B,28 the
Gynecologic Oncology Group examined trastuzumab as a single
agent in women with advanced/recurrent endometrial carcinoma.
The study failed to reach target accrual, and trastuzumab was
deemed inactive in HER2-overexpressing endometrial carcinoma.
However, the final analysis of GOG 181B was flawed, in that 47% of
the study participants treated with trastuzumab ultimately did not
have tumoral HER2/neu gene amplification. In addition, there was
no limit on prior lines of chemotherapy, so much of the cohort had
bulky, measurable, and heavily pretreated recurrent disease.29
On the basis of biologic plausibility, encouraging case re-
ports,30-32 and extensive experience with trastuzumab as a chemo-
therapeutic adjunct in multiple other disease sites, we constructed
a randomized phase II trial to quantify the benefit conferred by
addition of trastuzumab to carboplatin-paclitaxel among women
with USC whose tumors overexpress HER2/neu, in both the primary
setting for advanced disease and pretreated/recurrent disease.
METHODS
Study Design and Conduct
This was an investigator-initiated, randomized phase II study among
11 participating academic institutions within the United States. The study
was approved by a local Human Investigations Committee and in ac-
cordance with the precepts established by the Declaration of Helsinki.
Participants were randomly assigned 1:1 by the lead study institution using
minimization33 to balance the treatment arms for study site, disease status
(advanced-stage primary v recurrent USC), and residual tumor after
primary surgical cytoreduction within the advanced-stage cohort. Par-
ticipants were scheduled to receive intravenous carboplatin area under the
curve 5 and paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 over 3 hours every 21 days with or
without trastuzumab at 8 mg/kg for the first dose and 6 mg/kg in sub-
sequent cycles until disease progression or prohibitive toxicity (Fig 1).
Study drug was supplied by Genentech (South San Francisco, CA). This
study was registered with the National Institutes of Health (CinicalTrials.
gov identifier: NCT01367002). There were no significant changes to eli-
gibility criteria or trial methodology after commencement.
The trial was designed to accrue 100 participants at a rate of five per
month for 20 months. Interim analysis for futility was scheduled on ob-
serving 26 recurrences, progressions, or deaths and final analysis on ob-
serving 85 events. Power calculations assumed that median progression-free
survival (PFS) would be 6 months on the carboplatin-paclitaxel arm and
10.5 months on the carboplatin-paclitaxel-trastuzumab arm, equivalent to
a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.57 with trastuzumab addition. For the final efficacy
analysis, we planned to compare the carboplatin-paclitaxel-trastuzumab arm
to the carboplatin-paclitaxel arm for the expected increase in PFS by means
of the log-rank test, conducted using a one-sided a of 0.10. Under this plan,
85 recurrence/progression/death events gave the study 90% power to detect
HR of 0.57 with carboplatin-paclitaxel-trastuzumab versus carboplatin-
paclitaxel. Power was adjusted for the interim futility analysis using the
O’Brien-Fleming spending function to allocate type II error. We expected to
observe the 26th recurrence/progression/death event at 12.9 months and the
85th recurrence/progression/death event at 33.6 months. The first partici-
pant was enrolled in August 2011, after which the accrual rate was slower
than planned, and observed PFS exceeded original expectations. Because of
this, the interim futility analysis was not triggered until March 2016, when 47
participants were enrolled; its results indicated that the trial should continue
to enroll. Nonetheless, in March 2017, after enrolling a total of 61 partic-
ipants, the study was closed to further enrollment because of slow accrual
and long PFS. Final efficacy analysis commenced in August 2017, when the
last enrolled participant completed her assigned treatment.
Eligibility
All patients were $ 18 years old and had primary advanced (In-
ternational Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics 2009 stage III or IV)34
or recurrent (any previous stage) HER2/neu-positive USC as defined by an
immunohistochemistry score of 3+, or 2+ with gene amplification con-
firmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).35 HER2/neu-positive
status was determined using paraffin-embedded tumor tissue from either
primary surgery or recurrent disease. Scoring was performed according to
guidelines set forth by the 2007 ASCO/College of American Pathologists
(ASCO-CAP) for breast cancer.36 Specimens were centrally reviewed for
HER2/neu-positivity and confirmed to contain $ 10% USC by two gy-
necologic pathologists. Patients may have undergone optimal or suboptimal
primary cytoreductive surgery. Patients were enrolled within 8 weeks after
surgery or diagnosis of recurrence. Patients were required to exhibit Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group37 performance status of 0 to 2, adequate bone
marrow function, renal function, and hepatic function. All patients di-
agnosed with recurrence were required to have measurable disease, defined
as one or more target lesions per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
Tumors (RECIST) v1.1.38 Tumors within a previously irradiated field were
designated as nontarget lesions unless progression was documented or
a biopsy was obtained to confirm persistence at least 90 days after completion
of radiation. A treatment-free interval of . 6 months from last carboplatin-
paclitaxel was required. Patients with recurrent disease may not have received
more than three prior chemotherapies. Patients with recurrent disease who
achieved a response with an acceptable level of toxicity were permitted to
continue treatment with their assigned chemotherapy regimen beyond six
cycles after discussion with the study chair. Patients who had received prior
doxorubicin or its liposomal encapsulated preparation may not have had
$ 320 mg/m2 total dose and must have demonstrated a normal left ven-
tricular ejection fraction (ie, $ 45%). Granulocyte colony-stimulating
factors or erythropoietin were allowed only in the event of persistent
neutropenia or anemia. Detailed inclusion criteria and the schemata for
treatment modification are provided in the full protocol (Data Supplement).
End Points
The primary study end point was PFS, defined as length of time from
random assignment to disease recurrence, disease progression, or death for
any reason. Secondary objectives included objective response rate, overall
survival (OS), and safety of trastuzumab in patients with USC. Response
and disease progression were defined by RECIST 1.1.38 Common

 Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 was used
to describe adverse events.39 Computed tomography of the chest, abdo-
men, and pelvis were performed every 3 months or more frequently in
cases of clinical suspicion for progression.
Statistical Analyses
Patient characteristics, objective response rate, and occurrence of high-
grade adverse events were examined for differences between treatment arms
using two-sided Fisher’s exact and Wilcoxon rank sum tests at a = 0.05. PFS
was visualized as Kaplan-Meier curves both overall and stratified by disease
status and assessed for improvement with trastuzumab using one-sided log
rank tests. For the primary efficacy analysis, the log rank test used a one-sided
a = 0.10 significance level, as originally specified in the study’s protocol. All
other log rank tests used one-sided a = 0.05 significance levels. Every as-
sessment was accompanied by a Cox regression HR with two-sided 90% CI.
RESULTS
Patients
Between August 2011 and January 2017, 61 participants were
enrolled (Fig 1). Three were excluded due to withdrawal of consent
(n = 1) or failure to confirm HER2 positivity by FISH after
2+ immunohistochemistry (n = 2) by central review, leaving 58
(28 carboplatin-paclitaxel in the control arm and 30 carboplatin-
paclitaxel-trastuzumab in the experimental arm) evaluable for re-
sponse to treatment. Patient and disease characteristics are listed in
Table 1. Forty-one participants (71%) had advanced-stage disease;
17 participants (29%) had recurrent disease. Of those with advanced-
stage disease, 22 (54%) received primary radiation, and only five
(12%) had gross residual disease after primary cytoreductive surgery.
Of the participants with recurrent disease, the median number of
prior lines was one (range, zero to two) and was identical between
treatment arms. In addition, the treatment arms did not differ
significantly by race, ethnicity, study site, or disease status (advanced v
recurrent disease) or by radiation or cytoreductive surgery status
among participants with advanced-stage disease. Participants in the
experimental arm were younger (median, 67 years; interquartile
range, 64-69) compared with the control arm (median, 73 years;
interquartile range, 68-78; P = .006).
Treatment
The 28 participants in the control arm and 30 participants in
the experimental arm completed a total of 156 (range, one to eight)
and 178 (range, four to nine) cycles of carboplatin-paclitaxel,
respectively. Participants in the experimental arm received

 a total of 519 cycles of trastuzumab (median, 15; range, 5 to 53). In
all, 23 participants (82%) in the control arm completed six or more
cycles of carboplatin-paclitaxel. In the experimental arm, 26
participants (87%) completed six or more paclitaxel cycles, and 28
participants (93%) completed six or more carboplatin cycles.
Primary End Point: PFS
At time of analysis, the 58 response-evaluable participants ex-
perienced 40 PFS-related events (39 progressions, one fatal throm-
boembolism) during 854.0 months (median, 10.0 months) of follow-
up. Among thosewhoremainedaliveandprogressionfree,fivewereinthe
control arm, and 13 were in the experimental arm. Overall, median PFS
was 8.0 months in patients in the control arm and 12.6 months in patients
intheexperimental arm(P= .005; HR, 0.44; 90% CI, 0.26to 0.76; Fig 2A).
After subgrouping participants by disease status (ie, advanced
stage or recurrent), median PFS was 9.3 (control arm) versus 17.9
(experimental arm) months in patients with stage III and IV disease
undergoing primary treatment (P = .013; HR, 0.40; 90% CI, 0.20 to
0.80; Fig 2B), and 6.0 (control arm) versus 9.2 (experimental arm)
months in patients with recurrent disease (P = .003; HR, 0.14; 90%
CI, 0.05 to 0.54; Fig 2C).

Carboplatin-Paclitaxel-Trastuzumab for Uterine Serous Carcinoma
Downloaded from ascopubs.org by The University of Arizona on November 9, 2018 from 150.135.119.092

 The 2009 refinements in International Federation of Gynecology
and Obstetrics staging nomenclature for uterine cancer more accu-
rately predict survival among patients with stage III disease relative to
previous staging schemes, with a clear disadvantage for women with
nodal involvement, particularly para-aortic.40,41 In a subset analysis
that excluded stage IIIA or IIIB disease, trastuzumab continued to
show benefit in women with the worst prognoses (Appendix Fig A1).
Secondary End Points: Overall Response, Safety, OS
Among patients with recurrent disease, best RECISTresponses
to treatment were as follows: two patients (25%) with complete
responses (CRs), four patients (50%) with partial responses (PRs),
one patient (12.5%) with stable disease (SD), and one patient
(12.5%) with progressive disease (PD) in the control arm, compared
with one patient (11%) with CR, three patients (33%) with PR, five
patients (56%) with SD, and zero patients (0%) with PD in the
experimental arm. Clinical benefit thus reached 87.5% in the control
arm and 100% in the experimental arm (P = .47), with objective
response (CR + PR) rates of 75% and 44%, respectively (P = .33).
Sixty patients were evaluable for toxicity; 57 of them had one
or more CTCAE events during treatment. Table 2 counts all high-
grade toxicities (CTCAE grade $ 3) that occurred in one or more
patients; none differed significantly between treatment arms.
Hypertension displayed the largest treatment-arm difference
(a 5:0 split; P = .055), but the five events in question, all grade 3,
were scored by investigators as unrelated (n = 2), unlikely (n = 2),
and possible (n = 1) for relatedness to study drug. One patient in
the experimental arm experienced a grade 3 decrease in left

Fig 2. Progression-free survival (PFS). (A) Median progression-free survival was improved by 4.6 months in patients (n = 58) who received trastuzumab with carboplatin-
paclitaxel (12.6 months) compared with those who received carboplatin-paclitaxel alone (8.0 months; P = .005; hazard ratio [HR], 0.44; 90% CI, 0.26 to 0.76). (B) The addition of
trastuzumab benefitted patients (n = 41) with advanced disease in the primary treatment setting (17.9 v 9.3 months; HR, 0.40; 90% CI, 0.20 to 0.80; P = .013). (C) The addition of
trastuzumab also benefitted patients (n = 17) with recurrent disease after zero, one, or two lines of prior chemotherapy (9.2 v 6.0 months; HR, 0.14; 90% CI, 0.05 to 0.54;
P = .003). In total, there were 40 progression events; among those who remained alive and progression free, five were in the control arm and 13 were in the experimental arm.

 ventricular ejection fraction. The fatal thromboembolism occurred
in a patient randomly assigned to the control arm. Event-level
toxicities by system and patient-level toxicities by frequency of
treatment occurrence are shown fully in the Data Supplement.
Twenty-three deaths were observed among the 58 participants
during 1,156.8 total months (median, 15.4 months) of follow-up,
indicating that current data are not yet mature. Preliminary analysis
showed that among 41 participants with advanced USC (14 deaths),
we observed a 59% mortality reduction in the trastuzumab arm (HR,
0.41; 90% CI, 0.16 to 1.03), but the improvement fell short of
statistical significance (P = .0503). Similarly, among 17 participants
with recurrent USC (nine deaths), we observed a 68% mortality
reduction in the trastuzumab arm (HR, 0.32; 90% CI, 0.07 to 1.46;
P = .097). Finally, in the sensitivity analysis, we excluded five par-
ticipants with stage IIIA or IIIB disease and re-examined the effect of
trastuzumab in the advanced-stage setting. Among 36 patients with
stage IIIC or IV disease (14 deaths), we observed a 66% mortality
reduction in the trastuzumab arm (HR, 0.34; 90% CI, 0.14 to 0.86;
P = .023). The preliminary analysis of OS thus suggests that the
greatest benefit of trastuzumab may be in the up-front setting in those
with the most advanced disease. A more robust analysis of the effect
of trastuzumab effect on OS will be conducted once deaths reach 30.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we demonstrate that addition of trastuzumab to
carboplatin-paclitaxel in HER2/neu-positive USC results in a 56%
decrease in risk of progression relative to carboplatin-paclitaxel
alone and increases PFS by 4.6 months, with benefit both in first-
line adjuvant therapy for advanced-stage disease and in the re-
current setting. A preliminary analysis of OS suggests similar

Carboplatin-Paclitaxel-Trastuzumab for Uterine Serous Carcinoma

 trends, with the most clinical benefit from trastuzumab observed in
the up-front treatment setting in those with stage IIIC or IV disease.
The combination is well tolerated and may be associated with ex-
ceptional PFS in some patients, including two who received $ 50
cycles of trastuzumab. We have also herein demonstrated for uterine
cancer that HER2/Neu overexpression defined as 3+ by immuno-
histochemistry or 2+ with confirmatory FISH reliably identifies
a target population for whom clinical benefit can be achieved with
this therapy. Although our study failed to achieve planned enroll-
ment because of slow accrual and long PFS, to our knowledge this is
the first prospective study in endometrial cancer targeting USC
exclusively and the largest randomized report to date to describe the
activity of trastuzumab in HER2-overexpressing USC. Our findings
contribute to a growing body of literature, including preliminary
data from the phase IIa My Pathway trial in HER2-overexpressing
solid tumors (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02091141), to
support site-agnostic drug approval, in which molecular biologic
characteristics may prevail over tissue of origin alone.42
Our study encompasses limitations that may add impreci-
sion to our estimates. First, although minimization was used as
a method of ensuring balance between groups (Table 1), patients
in the control arm were older (median, 73 years) than those in the
experimental arm (median, 66 years; P = .006). Although this
may have biased outcomes in favor of the experimental arm,
several studies have shown that age is not an independent
prognostic factor for recurrence in patients with comparably
staged and treated endometrial cancer.43 Second, given the ab-
sence of validated biomarkers or other means of assessing pro-
gression, a scan interval of 3 months during maintenance therapy
may have overestimated progression-free intervals compared
with a study design that incorporates more frequent assessments;
however, it would have done so equally in both arms. Third, the
study was not placebo controlled and imaging was not centrally
reviewed; notably, only radiologists with expertise in RECIST
criteria reviewed the images at each site. Fourth, our study closed
before enrolling all participants. Although an interim futility
analysis indicated benefit of the trastuzumab arm, enrollment was
slower than anticipated because of the rarity of the tumor type, the
long PFS, and a lower-than-expected number of women with
HER2-positive tumors. Fifth, the ASCO-CAP breast cancer
guidelines for HER2 testing were updated midtrial in 2013; our
study team opted to maintain uniformity in testing by using the
2007 testing guidelines throughout the trial duration. In support of
such an approach, a recent ancillary study of three Breast Cancer
International Research Group studies, published in Journal of
Clinical Oncology, showed no difference between the original
US Food and Drug Administration–approved criteria for HER2
gene amplification and the current ASCO-CAP guidelines for
correlation with survival outcomes. Thus, there may not be
a demonstrable advantage to using the current ASCO-CAP
guidelines.44 Finally, these data are immature, and final OS esti-
mates are eagerly awaited. We anticipate that OS may be tainted by
crossover to the experimental arm, leading to underestimation of
benefit from trastuzumab. Nevertheless, preliminary analysis fa-
vors the trastuzumab arm in patients with the most advanced
(stage IIIC or IV) disease. Of note, improvement in PFS is in-
creasingly believed to be an appropriate primary end point in
oncology, and one that was met in the current study.
In summary, novel therapeutic strategies must be developed
for USC. Outcomes for women with this malignancy remain
dismal.16 Our study demonstrates that the addition of trastuzumab
to carboplatin-paclitaxel improves PFS by 4.6 months in women
with advanced-stage or recurrent USC and achieves a meaningful
clinical benefit rate without increasing toxicity. The greatest benefit
may be observed when trastuzumab is used with carboplatin-
paclitaxel in the up-front setting and in those with stage IIIC or IV
disease. These encouraging results deserve further investigation to
determine their impact on overall survival in patients with ad-
vanced or recurrent USC who overexpress HER2/neu. We await the
analysis of more mature survival data to inform next steps in
studying this targeted therapeutic approach.
