IMPORTANCE The increased use of psychiatric services in the US pediatric population raises
concerns about the appropriate use of psychotropic medications for very young children.
OBJECTIVE To assess the longitudinal patterns of psychotropic medication use in association
with diagnosis and duration of use in a Medicaid-insured birth cohort.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A cohort design was applied to computerized Medicaid
administrative claims data for 35 244 children born in a mid-Atlantic state in 2007 and
followed up for up to 96 months through December 31, 2014. Children were included in the
birth cohort if they had an enrollment record at birth or within 3 months of birth and at least 6
months of continuous enrollment from birth. The cohort represents 92.2% of 38 225
Medicaid-insured newborns in 2007.
EXPOSURES Mental health treatments from birth through age 7 years.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Cumulative incidence of first psychiatric diagnosis and
psychotropic medication use (monotherapy or concomitant use of psychotropic medications)
from birth through age 7 years, total and by sex, and the cumulative incidence of the use of
psychosocial services (age, 0-7 years) as well as the annual duration of medication use (ie,
number of days of psychotropic medication use among children 3-7 years of age).
RESULTS Of the 35 244 children in the cohort, 17 267 were girls and 17 977 were boys. By age
8 years, 4550 children in the birth cohort (19.7% [percentage adjusted for right censoring])
had received a psychiatric diagnosis (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision,
Clinical Modification codes 290-319); 2624 of these diagnoses (57.7%) were behavioral
(codes 312, 313, or 314). Girls were more likely than boys to receive an incident psychiatric
diagnosis of adjustment disorder (355 of 1598 [22.2%] vs 427 of 2952 [14.5%]; P < .001) or
anxiety disorder (114 of 1598 [7.1%] vs 120 of 2952 [4.1%]; P < .001). By age 8 years, 2196
children in the cohort (10.2% [percentage adjusted for right censoring]) had received a
psychotropic medication. Among medication users, 1763 of 2196 (80.5% [percentage
adjusted for right censoring]) received monotherapy, 343 of 2196 (16.4% [percentage
adjusted for right censoring]) received 2 medication classes concomitantly, and 90 of 2196
(4.3% [percentage adjusted for right censoring]) received 3 or more medication classes
concomitantly for 60 days or more (range, 78-180 days). The annual median number of days
of psychotropic medication use among medicated children increased with age, reaching 210
of 365 days for children 7 years of age. Among children 7 years of age, the median number of
days of use of an antipsychotic (193 days [interquartile range, 60-266 days]), stimulant (183
days [interquartile range, 86-295 days]), or α-agonist (199 days [interquartile range, 85-305
days]) exceeded half of the year.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Medicaid-insured children received substantial mental health
services and had prolonged exposure to psychotropic medications in the early years of life.
These findings highlight the need for outcomes research in pediatric populations.

 T
he increase in the prevalence of treated psychiatric di-
agnoses and the use of psychotropic medications in pe-
diatric populations in the United States1-5 has gener-
ated public health concerns,6-8 particularly regarding the
expanded use of antipsychotics for the behavioral manage-
ment of children.9 Most pediatric psychotropic medication use
(67%)10 is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administra-
tion and is therefore prescribed off-label, whereby the evi-
dence for the benefits is not available to balance the risk of po-
tential harm.10-12 The differential use of psychotropic
medications among poor, near-poor, and foster care chil-
dren, who are more likely than privately insured youth to re-
ceive psychotropic medications,13-15 raises social and ethical
concerns. Although there is evidence to support the efficacy
of stimulants in the management of attention-deficit/
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)16 and antipsychotics for ag-
gression in autism spectrum disorders (ASD),17 concerns con-
tinue unabated about off-label use and the short- and long-
term neurobiological effects of early exposure to complex
combinations of medications in community populations.18,19
During the past 20 years, cross-sectional studies have
assessed the trends in psychiatric diagnosis and treatment
in pediatric populations.20-25 However, little is known about
the longitudinal patterns of pediatric use of psychiatric
services.26,27 To our knowledge, there has been no assess-
ment of the cumulative use of mental health services from
birth in a Medicaid-insured cohort. In addition, although
there is evidence to support sex differences in the preva-
lence of psychiatric diagnosis and treatment,3,28,29 sex dif-
ferences in the patterns of initiation of psychiatric services
among children are largely unknown.
Furthermore, little research has been devoted to devel-
opmentalpsychopharmacologydespiteconcernsthatearlyex-
posure to such medications in utero or in the preschool years
could potentially alter physical, cognitive, and emotional
development.30-33 This knowledge gap and the controversies
surrounding the safety of pediatric psychotropic medication
use highlight the need to understand the extent of pediatric
mental health services in a longitudinal framework.
We assessed the cumulative incidence of a first psychiat-
ric diagnosis and first use of psychotropic medication class use
in a Medicaid-insured population of the same children across
8 years. To appreciate the context of service use, we assessed
the cumulative incidence of psychosocial service use and the
duration of psychotropic class use among medication users.
Methods
Study Design
The cohort was selected from computerized Medicaid claims
data for newborns in a mid-Atlantic state in 2007 (eFigure in
theSupplement)andfollowedupfor96monthsorlessthrough
December 31, 2014. Enrollees included in the birth cohort had
an enrollment record within 3 months of birth and 6 months
or more of contiguous enrollment. Enrollees were lost to fol-
low-upiftheyweremissing6ormorecontiguousmonths.This
study was reviewed and approved by the University of
Maryland, Baltimore, institutional review board. Because de-
identified, secondary administrative claims data were used,
parental consent or waiver was not required.
Welinkedenrollmentfilestooutpatientandphysicianfiles
and dispensed prescription drug files to assess International
Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modifica-
tion (ICD-9-CM) diagnosis codes, procedure codes, and date
of service. The prescription drug files comprise prescription
drug names and dispensing dates.
Outcome Measures
The outcome measures were the cumulative incidence of psy-
chiatricdiagnosesandpsychotropicmedicationclassuse,both
total and by enrollee characteristics; the cumulative inci-
dence of the use of psychosocial services; and the annual du-
ration of psychotropic medication class use (ages, 3-7 years).
In addition, we assessed sex-specific differences in incident
psychiatric diagnosis and psychotropic medication class use.
Psychiatric Diagnoses
Using ICD-9-CM codes, we identified the annual cumulative
percentage of children who received a clinician-reported di-
agnosis from birth through age 7 years, in total and stratified
by race/ethnicity, Medicaid eligibility group, and residential lo-
cale. To improve the validity of clinician-reported diagnoses,
we required 2 or more diagnosis claims on separate days.34
Eight diagnostic groups were examined in the following cat-
egories:ADHD,disruptivedisorders,learningdisorder(LD),ad-
justment disorder, anxiety disorders, depression, ASD, and
other psychiatric diagnoses (eTable 1 in the Supplement).
Psychotropic Medication Classes
We assessed the annual cumulative percentage of first psycho-
tropic medication dispensing from birth through age 7 years, in
total and stratified by race/ethnicity, Medicaid eligibility, and
residential locale. Medications were grouped into 6 classes:
stimulants, α-agonists, antidepressants, antipsychotics, anxio-
lytic and hypnotics, and other (ie, atomoxetine hydrochloride
and anticonvulsant-mood stabilizers). Enrollees with
ICD-9-CM codes for seizure disorder were excluded if they had
no codes for psychiatric or developmental disorder diagnoses.

Key Points
Question What is the cumulative incidence of psychiatric
diagnosis and use of psychotropic medications in a
Medicaid-insured birth cohort by age 8 years?
Findings In this cohort study of 35 244 newborns, 19.7% received
a psychiatric diagnosis and 10.2% received a psychotropic
medication by age 8 years; 20% of medication users received 2 or
more medication classes concurrently for 60 days or more. At age
7 years, half or more of the medicated children had more than 200
days of drug exposure.
Meaning Early exposure to psychotropic medications has
implications for long-term safety and highlights the need for
outcomes research in young children.

 2 or 3 or more concurrent dispensings from different medica-
tion classes for 60 days or more.
Additional Outcomes
Using Current Procedural Terminology codes, we assessed
the annual cumulative percentage of the cohort who
received a psychosocial service (ie, individual, family, or
group psychotherapy). Medication use was minimal by age
2 years. Consequently, we estimated the annual duration of
use among continuously enrolled children 3 to 7 years of age
(n = 15 207). Finally, across 8 years, we assessed the distri-
bution of any psychiatric diagnosis among medication users
according to medication class.
Covariates
Study covariates included sex, race/ethnicity (white, African
American, Hispanic, and other or missing), enrollees’resi-
dential locale (urban, suburban, or rural county) and Medic-
aid eligibility group (children in foster care, recipients of
Supplemental Security Income [SSI], and youths eligible by
family income at or below the federal poverty level [Tempo-
rary Assistance for Needy Families] or family income
≥200%-300% above the federal poverty level [State Chil-
dren’
s Health Insurance Plan]).
Statistical Analysis
Using survival analysis, we estimated the 8-year cumulative
incidence of psychiatric diagnosis and psychotropic medica-
tion class use, total and by covariates. In addition, we esti-
mated the sex-specific incidence of first psychiatric diagno-
sis and first psychotropic medication class use. We used
Kaplan-Meier estimators to address loss to follow-up owing
to administrative censoring. For each 1-year interval, we cal-
culated the cumulative incidence as the number of children
with the event of interest divided by the number of children
at risk. Children who were lost to administrative censoring
were not counted as at risk. Cox proportional hazards
regression models were used to assess statistical differences
in the cumulative incidence of psychiatric diagnosis and
psychotropic medication use while adjusting for covariates.
We estimated the cumulative incidence of the use of
psychosocial services using Kaplan-Meier estimators.
Among continuously enrolled children 3 to 7 years of age,
we calculated annual unadjusted median number of days of
psychotropic medication class use by total and for selected
medication classes among medicated children. Using quan-
tile regression models, we estimated the adjusted median
number of days of medication class use according to eligibil-
ity group. Models were adjusted for study covariates. With
χ2 analyses, we compared the sex-specific proportions of
incident psychiatric diagnoses and psychotropic medication
class across 8 years. Statistical analyses were performed
with SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc), and statistical
graphics were plotted with R, version 3.4.2 (R Foundation
for Statistical Computing). P < .05 (2-sided) was considered
significant.

[42.9%]),withasimilardistributionofwhite(8330[23.6%])and
Hispanic (7254 [20.6%]) children (eTable 2 in the Supplement).
Main Outcomes
First Psychiatric Diagnosis
The cumulative incidence of psychiatric diagnosis linearly in-
creased from 0.3% (n=107 [percentage adjusted for right cen-
soring]) by age 1 year to 19.7% (n=4550 [percentage adjusted
for right censoring]) by age 8 years (Figure 1A). Across 8 years,
57.7% (2624 of 4550) of the diagnoses were behavioral. Atten-
tion-deficit/hyperactivitydisorderandLDaccountedfor43.9%
(1999 of 4550) and 31.6% (1438 of 4550) of the psychiatric di-
agnoses, respectively (eTable 3 in the Supplement).
By age 8 years, the cumulative incidence of diagnosis was
greater among white children (27.6% [1372 of 8330; percent-
age adjusted for right censoring]) compared with African
American children (21.4% [2206 of 15105; percentage ad-
justedforrightcensoring];hazardratio[HR],0.72;95%CI,0.67-
0.77) and Hispanic children (10.2% [528 of 7254; percentage
adjusted for right censoring]; HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.48-0.60)
(eTable 4 in the Supplement). Furthermore, more than half of
the children receiving foster care (58.8% [413 of 948; percent-
age adjusted for right censoring]; HR, 4.45; 95% CI, 4.01-
4.93) and those eligible for SSI (62.7% [680 of 1266; percent-
age adjusted for right censoring]; HR, 6.32; 95% CI, 5.82-
6.87) received a diagnosis in contrast to 16.6% (3457 of 33030
[percentage adjusted for right censoring]) of income-eligible
children.Comparedwithresidentsofsuburbancounties(10.6%
[785 of 12152; percentage adjusted for right censoring]), resi-
dents of urban counties (24.3% [2706 of 16297; percentage ad-
justed for right censoring]; HR, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.79-2.12) or ru-
ral counties (23.7% [1059 of 6795; percentage adjusted for right
censoring]; HR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.58-1.94) were twice as likely to
receive a diagnosis (eTable 5 in the Supplement).
Boys were more likely than girls to receive a diagnosis of
ADHD at their first psychiatric visit (30.0% [885 of 2952] vs
22.4% [358 of 1598]; P < .001). Compared with boys, girls were

Figure 3 presents sex-specific data on first use of a psy-
chotropic medication. Boys were more likely than girls to ini-
tiate psychotropic treatment with stimulants (70.1% [1059 of
1510] vs 56.4% [387 of 686]; P < .001), whereas girls were twice
as likely as boys to initiate treatment with anxiolytics and hyp-
notics (25.2% [173 of 686] vs 13.2% [199 of 1510]; P < .001). This
finding is particularly concerning because there is insuffi-
cient evidence to support the use of anxiolytics and hypnot-
ics as first-line treatment for pediatric mental health
conditions.35 In addition, 11.5% of children who initiated treat-
ment with psychotropic medication received chloral hy-
drate, 2.2% received a nonbenzodiazepine medication, and
86% received a benzodiazepine, a highly potent subclass of
anxiolytics with a high potential for addiction and depen-
dence in both pediatric and adult populations.36
By age 8 years, 1763 of 2196 children (80.5%) using psy-
chotropic medication had received monotherapy, whereas
concomitant psychotropic use for 60 days or more (range,
78-180 days) was observed among 343 of 2196 children
(16.4%; percentage adjusted for right censoring) with 2 con-
current psychotropic classes and 90 of 2196 children (4.3%;
percentage adjusted for right censoring) with 3 or more con-
current psychotropic classes (Figure 1D-F). The concurrent
use of 3 or more medications was 3 to 4 times more com-
mon among children receiving foster care (11.6%; HR, 4.26;
95% CI, 2.29-7.89) and those eligible for SSI (18.4%; HR,

dren (3.6%) (eTable 9 in the Supplement).

Discussion
Our findings reveal substantial early use of mental health ser-
vices from birth through age 7 years. A diagnosis of ADHD and
the use of stimulants in girls were only modestly lower than
for boys. Compared with boys, girls were more likely to initi-
ate psychotropic use with an anxiolytic or hypnotic medica-
tion. Overall, approximately 20% of medicated children
(433 of 2196 [percentage adjusted for right censoring]) re-
ceived 2 or more classes concomitantly for 60 days or more.
At age 7 years, half or more of the children taking psychotro-
picmedicationshadmorethan200daysofdrugexposure.Our
findings capture the occurrence of a first psychiatric diagno-
sis in the same children across 8 years. Characterizing the first
psychiatric diagnosis provides insight into how and when chil-
dren enter mental health service treatment, critical informa-
tion for understanding how best to address pediatric mental
health needs and future research priorities.
Diagnostic Patterns
OurassessmentoftheincidenceofADHD,theleadingclinician-
reported psychiatric diagnosis, showed that 9.4% (1999 of
35 244 [percentage adjusted for right censoring]) of the co-
hort(13.2%ofboys[1444of17 977;percentageadjustedforright
censoring] vs 5.4% of girls [555 of 17 267; percentage adjusted
forrightcensoring])hadanADHDdiagnosisbyage8years.This
finding is consistent with national estimates from a parent-
reported telephone survey of clinician-diagnosed ADHD.37 In
comparison with a 1990 estimate of the cumulative inci-
dence of research-identified ADHD in a largely white regional
birth cohort in Minnesota,38 our findings suggest a 2-fold
greater cumulative incidence of ADHD by 2014. Further-
more, we report a 2.4:1 ratio of male to female cumulative in-
cidence of ADHD by age 8 years, with a male to female ratio of
first psychiatric diagnosis that suggests that an increasing pro-
portion of girls (1.3:1) are recipients of an initial mental health
service with an ADHD diagnosis. This narrowing margin un-
derscores the need to explore and understand the reported el-
evated risk for comorbid psychopathologic conditions among
girls with ADHD.39
Learning disorder was the second most common psychi-
atric diagnosis in the cohort (5.3% [1438 of 35 244; percent-

 age adjusted for right censoring] by age 8 years). Our cumu-
lative assessment shows that 81.6% of LD cases (1173 of 1438)
in the cohort were identified by age 3 years. This finding is par-
ticularly interesting because early detection and manage-
ment (eg, special educational services or speech-language
therapy)iskeytocontrollinglong-rangeconsequencesofLD.40
Only 17.5% of the children with LD (252 of 1438) received psy-
chotherapy during the 8-year study period, which suggests a
need to promote nonmedication therapy and to educate par-
ents and caregivers on the role of nonmedication therapy in
LD management, particularly in Medicaid populations.
Medication Use
Cumulatively, 10.2% of the cohort (2196 of 35 244 [percent-
ageadjustedforrightcensoring])receivedapsychotropicmedi-
cation by the age of 8 years. Of these medication users
(n = 2196), 74.9% (n = 1645) received a stimulant, most of
whom(89.7%[n = 1475])initiateduseduringschoolyears(ages
5-7 years). Our cumulative findings suggest that most psycho-
tropic medication use in the cohort was for behavioral man-
agement, with a lower male to female ratio (1.2:1) of stimu-
lant use compared with a 1998 statewide survey of elementary
school students in this state (3.5:1).41 These findings empha-
sizeanarrowingofthestimulantmedicationtosexratioamong
young children.
An 8-year assessment of psychiatric diagnostic groups
among children using psychotropic medication shows that ap-
proximately 90% of those who received stimulants (1440 of
1645 [87.5%]), atomoxetine (102 of 114 [89.5%]), or α-ago-
nists (616 of 706 [87.3%]) had a behavioral diagnosis. This find-
ing is consistent with the recommendations for the pharma-
cologic management of behavioral disorders.42,43 However,
while there is clinical evidence to support the use of antipsy-
chotics for children with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder
and for some children with ASD, only 15.1% of children
(24 of 159) in the birth cohort using antipsychotics had a di-
agnosis of ASD, 1.9% (3 of 159) had a diagnosis of schizophre-
nia, and 6.3% (10 of 159) had a diagnosis of bipolar disorder
(eTable 11 in the Supplement). This finding suggests that an-
tipsychotics are largely used for off-label behavioral manage-
ment in the birth cohort, highlighting the need for a delicate
benefit-risk balance.
Overall, given the considerable incidence of trauma and
physical abuse among very young Medicaid enrollees,44 the
expanded use of psychotropic medications in this birth co-
hort is not surprising. Our cumulative estimates highlight the
extent of early exposure to psychotropic medication and sup-
port the need for drug safety monitoring and outcomes re-
search to provide evidence for the benefit-risk balance, par-
ticularly in the early years of life.45
Concomitant Medication Use
Cumulatively, 19.7% of our birth cohort (433 of 2196) re-
ceived 2 or more psychotropic medications concomitantly for
60 days or more, with most concomitant use beginning after
5 years of age. Our estimate of concomitant medication use is
conservative,requiring60ormoredaysofoverlap.Amongchil-
dren using 2 concomitant medications, the leading pair in-
cluded stimulants and α-agonists, commonly used for behav-
ioral management.43 In light of the recent findings associating
pediatric use of antipsychotics with serious metabolic ad-
verse effects,46,47 the greater use of antipsychotic medica-
tion in combination with other psychotropics among Medic-
aid enrollees suggests, at a minimum, the need for improving
antipsychotic-related laboratory assay monitoring48 at base-
line and at regular follow-ups to guard against treatment-
emergent conditions such as type 2 diabetes,46,47 particu-
larly for behavioral disorder management.45
Duration of Medication Use

Limitations and Strengths
Severallimitationsofourstudyshouldbenoted.First,thisstudy
uses Medicaid data from a mid-Atlantic state and may not gen-
eralizetootherMedicaidpopulationsorprivatelyinsuredpopu-
lations. Second, we analyzed clinician-reported diagnoses that
arelessreliablethanresearch-identifieddiagnoses.However,to
improve validity, each diagnosis was confirmed by more than 1
claim on different days.34 Third, we captured dispensed medi-
cationsandnotmedicationconsumption.Fourth,whileacom-
parisonofmultiplecohortsfromoverlappingyearscouldreveal
temporal changes in use patterns, we assessed a single cohort
across 8 years because the literature suggests minimal tempo-
ralchangesinthestudypopulationandagerangeacross8years.50
Finally,intheabsenceofdataondeathormigration,wecould
notaccountforlosstofollow-up.However,morethanhalfofthe
cohort was insured by Medicaid across 8 years. Much greater
populationretentionisrecordedinpreviouscommunity-based
cohort studies that have contributed to our understanding of
early-onset psychiatric disorders.31,51-53 In recent times, claims

strength of this longitudinal study is that it provides an 8-year

 highlight the need for safety and outcomes research, particu-
larly for health outcomes such as metabolic imbalance, weight
gain, and sleep disturbances after initiation of psychotropic
medication for very young children. Effectiveness research in
observational cohorts should include functional improve-
ments (eg, school performance and social relationships). The
role of including parent training for medication monitoring is
critical.
