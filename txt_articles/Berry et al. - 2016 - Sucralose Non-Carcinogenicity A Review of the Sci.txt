ABSTRACT
Regulatory authorities worldwide have found the nonnutritive sweetener, sucralose, to be
noncarcinogenic, based on a range of studies. A review of these and other studies found through a
comprehensive search of electronic databases, using appropriate key terms, was conducted and
results of that review are reported here. An overview of the types of studies relied upon by
regulatory agencies to assess carcinogenicity potential is also provided as context. Physiochemical
and pharmacokinetic/toxicokinetic studies confirm stability under conditions of use and reveal no
metabolites of carcinogenic potential. In vitro and in vivo assays reveal no confirmed genotoxic
activity. Long-term carcinogenicity studies in animal models provide no evidence of carcinogenic
potential for sucralose. In studies in healthy adults, sucralose was well-tolerated and without
evidence of toxicity or other changes that might suggest a potential for carcinogenic effects. In
summary, sucralose does not demonstrate carcinogenic activity even when exposure levels are
several orders of magnitude greater than the range of anticipated daily ingestion levels.
Introduction
One question that is being repeatedly responded to by
health and regulatory authorities is the question of
whether nonnutritive sweeteners (NNSs) can cause can-
cer (1–3). While a wide range of studies are published
that describe the safety of sucralose, a comprehensive
review of the studies that lead regulators to conclude that
sucralose is noncarcinogenic can be useful to the scien-
tific community, including health care professionals and
others who have the responsibility to provide sound
advice in response to questions related to health and
nutrition. This article provides a systematic review, and
summarizes the results, of these and other studies
through a comprehensive search of electronic databases,
using appropriate key terms, including “sucralose,” “car-
cinogenic,” “metabolism,” and “safety”; using defined
selection criteria (i.e., abstracts and case reports not
included in the literature retrieved from search); and
through critical appraisal of results by experienced inde-
pendent reviewers (4). The data discussed are both pub-
lished literature and those required by, and reported to,
international regulatory agencies. As context, an over-
view of the types of studies relied upon by regulatory
agencies to assess carcinogenicity potential is also
provided.
In reviewing these data, it is important to understand
the fundamentals used by food safety and health regula-
tory agencies in evaluating the safety of new food ingre-
dients.
Studies

agencies
undergo initial assessment for the quality and appropri-
ateness of the study design and methodology(ies), tak-
ing into account the nature of the study being reported,
e.g., whether the study is an in vitro or in vivo study, or
a short-term or long-term dosing study, etc. Food safety
and public health regulatory agencies evaluate the
potential for carcinogenicity based on the quality and
reliability of the studies conducted; known/predicted
structure–activity relationships (SAR) and chemical
characteristics of the substance under investigation; the
fate of the substance in conditions of requested use; and
outcomes from all types of studies designed to evaluate
safety, including in vitro studies, whole animal model
studies, and studies in humans. Not all the studies are
weighted equally in safety assessments (5–9). A hierarchy
exists for evidence needed to allow for the approval of a
new food ingredient. At the first level, in silico SARs and

 in vitro studies, notably genotoxicity and biochemical
studies, are required. At the second level, tests for cancer
and systemic toxicity in animals are required. Pharmacoki-
netic data are also recommended. At a third level, out-

studies
can
provide
additional important information. Human epidemiology
studies are not a regulatory requirement in the initial
assessment of the safety of sweeteners. However, any study
already performed would be expected to be submitted and
results would be considered in the safety assessment.
Regulatory guidelines provide the framework for the
kinds of studies that should be considered in investigat-
ing the overall safety, including carcinogenic potential, of
any new food ingredient (9–13). It is important to
emphasize that toxicological investigations performed as
part of the requirements for the regulation of drugs, pes-
ticides or food additives are not investigations performed
with the primary intent of conducting basic research, in
which the testing of a hypothesis is the primary objective.
Rather, research studies conducted to investigate the
safety of a new food ingredient are designed to enable
detection of potentially adverse outcomes of the test sub-
stance so as to identify risk potential and to safeguard
the target population. Research programs recommended
by regulatory agencies are designed to maximize the pos-
sibility of detecting adverse effects. Study parameters are
set to intentionally provoke a measurable response.
Importantly, observations are made that cover not only
the changes that might be found in the range of expected
human exposures but exposures that are significantly
(i.e., hundreds to thousands of times) greater. Such high
doses are unlikely to be experienced by the target popula-
tion and are also delivered with a frequency and duration
that is seldom experienced in a normal diet (8,14–16).
These toxicologic exposures are expected to produce
adverse outcomes at some point and the types of adverse
outcomes elicited can allow for important insights into
the biochemical nature of the food ingredient, its poten-
tial for health effects, and its appropriateness for the
intended use. Indeed, regulatory guidances relating to
the design of studies required for safety assessments
make clear that, toxic effects (observable effect levels) at
the maximum tolerated dose are necessary for certain
tests to be considered satisfactory (17,18).
Regulatory safety testing protocols have been carefully
evaluated and approved over many years of experience by
international authorities (19). The Good Laboratory Prac-
tices (GLP) methodologies are accepted as the norm for
pharmaceutical, food development, and regulatory labora-
tories that have a responsibility for conducting studies
designed to evaluate food ingredient safety (20–23). Few
laboratories outside of those routinely conducting food
ingredient safety studies for the purpose of regulatory
submissions may have the resources available to conduct
studies in accordance with GLP requirements.
To maximize the ability to obtain reliable study out-
comes, studies in rodents and other laboratory animal
species are also typically performed utilizing strains that
have been well-characterized and with abundant con-
temporary historical control data. Diets are carefully pro-
duced and constructed to minimize any potential effects
that could confound data interpretation; the conditions
and density of animal housing are specified and require a
testing environment that supports good animal health;
and data collection within the different types of core
research studies to be conducted is rigorously standard-
ized in terms of both extent and frequency (24,25). Mod-
ification
of
statistical
methodology
has
enabled
interpretation of data that may need to take into account
a plethora of information (a Bayesian approach) (26,27).
This rigorous pattern of testing required in regulatory
toxicology is not typically followed in hypothesis-driven
work, where studies addressing similar problems may
vary widely in their characteristics. In recognizing issues
that can confound study findings, a recent editorial in
Nature, reporting the outcome of a meeting of editors of
30 major scientific journals under the aegis of the Ameri-
can Association for the Advancement of Science, pointed
out that the source, species, strain and characteristics
(including inbred), sex, age, and husbandry for animals
should all be reported to achieve reproducible results in
animal studies. For cell lines used in in vitro studies, the
source, authentication, and mycoplasma contamination
status should all be known (25,28). Regulatory guidance
for conducting research programs to evaluate the safety
of a new food ingredient embodies these types of recom-
mendations, as can be seen in the Organisation for Eco-
nomic Co-operation and Development (OECD) research
study protocols (internationally agreed-upon protocols
for regulatory safety investigations published by the
OECD) (25).
In contrast to certain hypothesis-driven studies, where
variability may be desirable in the hypothesis-testing
context, protocols recommended for inclusion in holistic
safety testing programs are intentionally designed to
minimize variability and maximize the possibility of pro-
ducing an unspecified result (e.g., tumor production),
sometimes at the expense of realistic exposures. Variabil-
ity in animal strains, conditions, husbandry, housing,
etc. in such studies can confound data interpretation. As
such, food safety and health regulatory agencies typically
require study designs that minimize background “noise.”
This is addressed by rigorous standardization. It is diffi-
cult to demonstrate a null effect with confidence unless
the methods are highly standardized. It is also important
to evaluate “noise” by taking into account the full

 information available (e.g., is the finding reproducible;
do other studies support the finding; is the finding con-
sistent with known chemical structure and/or reactivity
of the substance being tested; etc.).
Notably, recent advances in techniques, in knowledge,
and databases created from analyses of accumulated data
are available to investigate causality and predisposing
factors related to carcinogenesis. The quality of data can
vary across studies and not all findings may be confirmed
in independent repeat studies. Regulators worldwide
must consider the strength of the data in order to pro-
mulgate use regulations, which are intended to limit the
risk for health effects on the public (8). Similarly, it is
also critical to assess new research in the context of the
whole of the data available, particularly when studies
have small sample sizes and/or were conducted utilizing
unconventional methodology. Results of observational
studies, which do not, by their nature, assess cause and
effect, must be especially interpreted in the context of all
available data. It is critical that correlation data not be
misinterpreted as evidence of cause and effect.

Findings
Scientific evidence supporting regulatory decisions
International and country- or region-specific guidelines
identify the types of evidence required to support the
risk assessment of a substance intended for human con-
sumption. The types of evidence required can be classi-
fied into three broad categories: 1) physicochemical
characterization; 2) in vitro and short-term in vivo toxi-
cological testing, including toxicokinetic studies [e.g.,
absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination or
ADME studies]; and 3) subchronic to chronic biochemi-
cal profiling and tests for toxicity and carcinogenicity,
using in vivo, in vitro, and ex vivo models; and specific
additional studies, as needed, such as specialized testing
(e.g., allergy, cognitive function, behavioral studies, and
human tolerance studies) (Fig. 1). If the physicochemical
and toxicological profiling of a substance does not iden-
tify carcinogenic risk, a need for additional profiling
would not be anticipated. If carcinogenic potential is sug-
gested or identified in these screening assays, health and
food safety regulatory agencies may move to prohibit the

 use of the substance in the food supply or may require
additional safety studies to evaluate dose–response and
mode of action in the process of evaluating the safety of
the studied ingredient (6,7,9,13,25,28,29) (Fig. 1).
This tiered approach to the safety assessment of new
food ingredients, used by regulatory agencies, limits the
amount of data initially generated for a risk assessment,
establishes the types of evidence to be considered, and
potentially reduces the extent of animal research con-
ducted by applying the 3-R approach: replace, refine, and
reduce (26,27). The initial tier includes requirements for
minimal testing and data, including determination of
absorption by the gastrointestinal tract of the compound
and the metabolic or manufacturing degradation prod-
ucts of a compound via in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo
models of absorption and bioavailability. If absorption
by the gastrointestinal tract is identified, or if the com-
pound exhibits toxicity, a second level of testing is
required. Similarly, results of the second tier of evidence
establish whether a third tier of testing is required. For
example, if data generated from second-tier studies did
not satisfy concerns of regulatory reviewers, additional
second tier (e.g., additional animal studies) or third tier
(e.g., studies in man) studies would be required.
Review of the data assembled for the safety assessment
of a food additive by experienced pathologists is neces-
sary for proper grouping of lesions for analysis of
increased tumor incidence related to a compound. Sev-
eral factors need to be considered, including the number
of species or strains with an increased tumor incidence,
number of positive studies, degree of tumor response,
evidence of SAR, evidence of dose–response relationship,
results of tests for genotoxicity, presence of preneoplastic
lesions, and reduced latency for tumor development or
increase in severity (malignancy) of the neoplasm (16).
Furthermore, expert panels of toxicologists, patholo-
gists, and statisticians review the body of evidence to
enable regulatory agency review to estimate the accept-
able daily intake (ADI) of a food additive. ADIs are set
on the basis of the highest no-observed-effect level
(NOEL) and expert judgment about the potential signifi-
cance of the target effect, with a safety factor to allow for
differences in human variability and interspecies differ-
ences (14). The ADI represents the average intake over a
lifetime of exposure that is expected to be safe (15). ADIs
are highly conservative, with safety factors of 100 or
1,000 often used (9). Daily intake excursions that are
sometimes higher than the ADI may have no associated
safety concern, when this intake is considered in the
scope of the average daily intake and given the safety fac-
tors employed at deriving an ADI. For new food ingre-
dients, including sucralose, safety is finally considered by
comparison of the estimated daily intake (EDI), to the
ADI. When the EDI does not exceed the ADI (an accept-
able/safe level), this provides an additional margin of
safety. It is worth noting that the EDI for sucralose is
very conservative. The EDI is calculated based on the
assumption that sucralose would replace virtually all
added sugar in all aspects of the diet. Thus, the EDI for
sucralose is likely to significantly overestimate actual
intakes experienced by consumers.
Scientific evidence assessing the carcinogenic
potential of substances
Observations reported in scientific and clinical literature
and reported to regulatory agencies are components of a
knowledge database (e.g., SAR) that identifies chemical
structures with likely genotoxic activity—and therefore
possible carcinogenic potential. These “structural alerts”
are available in several computerized databases and pub-
lications (30,31). Beyond structure, the manner in which
molecules are metabolized under physiological condi-
tions, in concert with their inherent reactivity, is central
to an evaluation of possible chemical carcinogenicity
(Fig. 1).
Chemical carcinogens can be broadly classified into
two categories; those chemicals and their metabolites
that react with DNA causing genetic damage or muta-
tions and those which do not directly interact with DNA
but which perturb other cellular processes that lead indi-
rectly to DNA damage (32). These two classes of carcino-
gens are referred to as genotoxic and nongenotoxic
carcinogens, respectively (33,34). Studies that investigate
the potential for a substance to cause genetic damage
and/or mutations are therefore some of the earliest stud-
ies conducted in evaluating possible carcinogenic risk.
Nongenotoxic carcinogens are believed to produce
cancer by binding to and altering cellular receptors
responsible for effects such as gene expression, cellular
metabolism, enhanced cell proliferation, inhibition of
cell–cell communication, and DNA methylation.
As a result, bioassays are the types of studies given the
greatest weight in considering the potential for a sub-
stance to be carcinogenic. Nevertheless, “positive” find-
ings in bioassays, particularly shorter-term bioassays,
may also require further investigation. Positive findings
in bioassays can sometimes result from confounding fac-
tors, including issues with technical performance, animal
housing and maintenance issues (e.g., problems with diet
quality and cage conditions); unexpected viral infections
(e.g., hepatitis virus); or concurrent infectious diseases
(e.g., mycoplasma pneumonia) (25). Species-specific
responses can also occur that may have no relevance to
humans (e.g., bladder cancer in long-term, extremely
high-dose studies of saccharin in rats) (35). As such,
1250
C. BERRY ET AL.
 positive findings must be critically considered in the con-
text of the whole of the experimental evidence.
Beyond risk assessments from chemical characteriza-
tion and mutagenicity/genotoxicity studies, toxicity stud-
ies (bioassays), which assess the short- and long-term
effect of exposure to a substance, can help to characterize
carcinogenic risk. Subchronic toxicity studies (e.g., 30- to
90-day studies) are conducted to estimate the appropri-
ate doses to be used in chronic toxicity studies, to deter-
mine NOELs for some toxicology endpoints, and to
support the appropriate design of long-term toxicity
studies (i.e., identify target organs). In general, sub-
chronic toxicity studies do not determine the carcino-
genic activity of a substance; however, subchronic
studies can provide important supportive data (36).
Advances in research have found that carcinogenic sub-
stances begin to exert observable effects earlier than had
been supposed (i.e., within �90 days) (37,38). As a result,
histopathologic and biochemical evaluations from sub-
chronic studies should be considered when evaluating
the carcinogenic potential of a compound categorized as
preneoplastic. Preneoplastic changes are not always,
however, a harbinger for the development of cancer.
They can instead be spontaneous changes or precursor
changes to the development of benign tumors (37–39).
Both chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity studies are
designed to help characterize the dose–response, define
toxicity and/or safety thresholds, provide data on health
effects at human exposure levels in appropriate animal
models, and provide data to assess mechanism of action
(40). Chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity research is fre-
quently carried out in tandem, to maximize the ability to
interpret findings, by conducting research under similar
circumstances and in same-sourced animals. Studies
classically defined as carcinogenicity studies (whether
performed in tandem with toxicity studies or not) are
still considered the gold standard for assessing potential
carcinogenicity, i.e., they are the key studies relied upon
by regulatory agencies around the world for evaluating
carcinogenicity potential.
Other studies can also provide important information
when assessing carcinogenic potential. Toxicokinetic
studies define the relationship between systemic expo-
sure to a substance, dose, and toxicity. Reproductive
studies identify the effect a substance has on the fertility
and gestation of the test animal. Developmental studies
characterize the physical, cognitive, and behavioral
effects a substance has on the test animal. Unusual find-
ings in such studies can be further evaluated and add to
the total comprehension of the substance’s safety, includ-
ing carcinogenic risk profile. It is important to note that
adverse effects can often be exhibited in bioassays when
doses are taken to extreme levels. Using very high dose
levels is a planned design element in many studies con-
ducted in a program to assess the overall safety of a new
food ingredient. Assessment of carcinogenicity potential
hinges on careful review of available SAR/chemical char-
acteristics data, mutagenicity data, measures of health
and development from all types of bioassays, compre-
hension of the substance’s metabolic fate and toxicoki-
netics, and the appropriate evaluation of preneoplastic
and neoplastic findings.
Scientific evidence assessing carcinogenic potential
of sucralose
Chemical structure and stability of sucralose. Sucralose
(1,6-dichloro-1,6-dideoxy-b-D-fructofuranosyl-4-chloro-
4-deoxy-a-D-galactopyranoside) is a substituted disac-
charide (41). It is synthesized by selective chlorination of
sucrose (common table sugar) at three of the primary
hydroxyl groups, involving inversion of configuration at
carbon-4, from the gluco- to the galacto-analogue. Based
on its chemical structure, the reactivity of sucralose would
be expected to be similar to that of polyhydric alcohols,
such as sucrose, with modification by the pyranose and
furanose ring systems (Fig. 2). The hydroxyl groups of
sucralose are more acidic (i.e., have a lower pKa) than
that of water. As such, any reaction of the multiple
hydroxyl groups on the sucralose molecule could only
occur in the absence of water and in the presence of
highly reactive substances, and then only under strongly
alkaline conditions—conditions that are not consistent
with normal human physiologic conditions. The expected

1251
 reactivity of sucralose with use in foods or in physiologic
systems, based on chemical structure, has been borne out
in early chemical research studies (42,48). Under condi-
tions representative of normal human physiological con-
ditions, sucralose had no opportunity to produce
chemical interactions (42). The results are consistent with
the fact that the chlorine moieties in sucralose are not in
the form of alkyl halides, being bonded to the stable ring
structures, and their presence creates steric hindrance on
the rings, also limiting the interactions. Hence, there is
very limited opportunity for biotransformation. Chemis-
try studies also confirm that the sucralose molecule is not
electrophilic, nor does it contain molecular structures
capable of being bioactivated to electrophilic reactive
metabolites. In all, sucralose contains no identified “struc-
tural alerts” (30,43) for either genotoxic or carcinogenic
activity. Further, sucralose is highly water soluble and has
a comparatively low fat solubility (very low octanol–water
partition coefficient: logKow D ¡0.51 § 0.05), so that
accumulation in fat stores would not be predicted and
indeed have not been found, based on studies using radio-
labeled sucralose (44).
From a chemical structure perspective, the sucralose
molecule is expected to be exceptionally stable. No evi-
dence of hydrolysis of the sucralose molecule has been
found in vivo (44–48). This is partly explained by the
fact that the glycosidic linkage of sucralose is signifi-
cantly more resistant to hydrolysis than is the glycosidic
linkage of sucrose (49)—the parent disaccharide used in
sucralose synthesis. This increased resistance to hydroly-
sis (or enzymatic cleavage) is related to the increased ste-
ric hindrance created by the replacement of the three
sucrose hydroxyl groups with three atoms of chlorine. In
an acidic solution, sucralose can slowly hydrolyze to its
two constituent substituted monosaccharides (44); these
hydrolysis products are resistant to further degradation
(50). After storage for 1 yr, detectable sucralose loss in
model (1% sucralose) aqueous systems is less than 1% at
25�C (44). No loss of sucralose is detected at pH 4 or 6
after 1 yr. While data suggest the possibility of hydrolysis
product formation, exposures are not definitive, and the
estimated possible exposure is in the ng/kg quantities
(51,52). Nonetheless, the safety of the sucralose hydroly-
sis products was fully investigated prior to health and
safety rulings permitting the use of sucralose. FDA and
other health regulatory agencies have found the sucralose
hydrolysis products to represent no carcinogenic or toxi-
cologic risk (53–55). Several studies under conditions
involving extremes of pH and/or temperature (as might
occur in baking) and ingredients found in various food
matrices demonstrated the chemical stability and lack of
reactivity of sucralose (56–58). Certain studies have
shown the production of different breakdown products
under highly artifactual conditions or conditions irrele-
vant to food usage (58–61). These studies are not investi-
gations of the fate of sucralose in actual usages for
production of foods/beverages and some also introduce
variables into the testing that would alter normal reac-
tion kinetics for the tested ingredients. For example,
pyrolysis studies using a 1:2 molar ratio mixture of
sucralose and glycerol can yield reaction products, which
are not found in studies designed and recommended for
the assessment of food ingredient stability (62). Overall,
the findings suggest no potential for reaction of sucralose
with biological molecules under physiological conditions
to result in either adduct products or dechlorination.
Bioassays assessing genotoxic potential of sucralose.
Results in a variety of in vitro (e.g., Ames, and DNA
damage/clastogenicity) and in vivo (e.g., mouse lym-
phoma, rodent micronucleus, and human lymphocyte)
assays demonstrate that sucralose does not cause gene
mutations or chromosomal damage (63–80) (Table 1).
Expert reviewers at regulatory agencies evaluated
these data and concurred that there is no concern for
genotoxic or mutagenic activity related to sucralose (50).
A single mouse lymphoma study, conducted very early in
the sucralose safety testing program, gave an equivocal result
with sucralose concentration of 10 mg/ml. This is a very
high concentration, which can result in conditions (e.g.,
osmolality changes) that can affect the assay and lead to
effects on DNA. An updated analysis of the study (i.e., per
updated international criteria) also determined that the
equivocal result would be viewed as a negative result, for
other technical reasons, under updated criteria (63). Two
Comet assays reported a positive finding with sucralose. In
one (74), review of these data identified a high incidence of
false positive findings in the study and lack of corroborating
studies with positive results (63). In the other (73), positive
findings were reported for a range of popular NNSs based
on assays using two human colon cancer cell lines (Caco-2
and HT-29) and one human embryonic kidney cell line
(HEK-293). The cells were exposed to extremely high con-
centrations of sweetener solutions (up to 50 mM or approxi-
mately 20 g/l sucralose) for up 72 h. The cell lines used are
not representative of normal human tissue. Together, the
relevance of the results is questionable.
Absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of
sucralose. Studies show that sucralose is not catabolized,
and therefore is not a source of energy, in either humans
or animals. Following oral intakes, it is not dechlorinated
or degraded into smaller chlorinated compounds (44–48).
Following ingestion, most sucralose (approximately 85%)
is
not
absorbed
and

 undergoes common phase II metabolism, specifically glu-
curonidation, about 2–3% in humans (46). Glutathione

a

reaction
(81–84) that does not normally generate reactive inter-
mediates, and instead neutralizes electrophiles (82). There
are no unique types of, or greater exposure to, glucuro-
nide conjugates formed in man, compared to surrogate
species. Both unchanged sucralose and its glucuronide
conjugates are excreted in urine, and are readily elimi-
nated with no bioaccumulation (44–48,85,86).
In humans, peak sucralose plasma concentrations of
262 ng equivalents/ml were achieved between 1.5 and
3.0 h after a single oral dose of 1 mg/kg body weight
(46). The half-life of sucralose is approximately 13 h (86).
The metabolic profile and pharmacokinetics are
similar among rodents, dogs, and man (44–48,86). No
adaptive change in sucralose metabolism was seen in rats
after 18 mo of daily sucralose intakes in amounts thou-
sands of times greater than estimated average daily
intakes (47).
Consistent with this, there is no evidence of sucralose
being a substrate for gut microflora, with only intact
sucralose found in feces. As such, exposure to gut micro-
flora is not a pathway for exposure to metabolites that
could be of concern (85).
Studies of radiolabeled compound confirm
that
absorbed sucralose is distributed to essentially all tissues,
indicating incorporation into total body water, consistent
with its highly water-soluble nature. While sucralose
moves readily with body water, there is no active trans-
port into milk, transplacentally, or across the blood–brain
barrier into the central nervous system, consequently any
distribution to those sites is limited (44,47) (Fig. 3). Due
to its high sweetness potency (about 600 times sweeter
than sucrose on a weight-for-weight basis), total intakes
are also remarkably low (on average, <3 mg/kg/day for
an adult), and, combined, with a low level of absorption,
any sucralose available to the systemic circulation is
exceedingly low, reflected by the very low peak plasma
levels following an oral dose.

NUTRITION AND CANCER
1253
 Separately, toxicokinetic and metabolic data estab-
lished that rats, mice, and dogs are the most appro-
priate surrogate species for humans for toxicity ass-
essments.
Toxicity studies with sucralose. In short-term and long-
term subchronic toxicity studies in rats and dogs, sucra-
lose was included in the diet continuously at up to 5.0%
(50,000 ppm, approximately equivalent to 5,000 mg/kg
body weight/day) concentrations. In the 4- and 8-wk die-
tary studies and in the 26-wk gavage study in rats, no his-
topathological changes were observed that could indicate
any concern for carcinogenic activity of sucralose (87).
The only histological findings noted were decreased
splenic mass and reduction in the lymphocyte mass of
the thymus in the high-dose females in the 8-wk study.
These data were ascribed to insufficient caloric intake—a
common finding in high-dose dietary studies of high-
potency sweeteners (44,88), which affect both the overall
dietary caloric value and palatability and slight prema-
ture involution of the thymus, respectively, and were not
replicated in a longer-term 26-wk gavage study (87). To
investigate these histologic findings, special studies were
designed to specifically investigate the effect of oral
gavage of sucralose to rats at doses of 4000, 3000, and
2000 mg/kg body weight/day for periods of, respectively,
approximately 4, 8, and 13 wk. Thymic weight effects or
pathological findings were not observed (89) (Table S1).
Premature thymic involution (thymic involution
occurring developmentally early) is a known potential
outcome when caloric intake is restricted sufficiently
(90–92). In the 8-wk sucralose dietary study, the very
high concentration
of sucralose
in the diet
(5%,
»5,000 mg/kg body weight/day) decreased the overall
nutrient density. In addition, diet palatability was subop-
timal (based on results of separate exploratory palatabil-
ity studies) and lower food consumption was observed.
The absence of the finding of premature thymic involu-
tion when sucralose was administered by gavage sup-
ports the interpretation that the dietary study findings
were secondary effects resulting from reduced food
intake and not directly related to the systemic presence
of sucralose. In the 26-wk oral gavage study, sucralose
intakes were up to 3,000 mg/kg body weight/day—com-
parable to the achieved average daily intake in the 8-wk
dietary study (1–5% of diet, approximately equivalent to
1000–5000 mg/kg body weight/day). In this study and
dietary and gavage studies with lower daily sucralose
exposures, no effects on spleen or thymus weight or
pathology were observed (87,89).
As discussed above, dietary and gavage studies expose
animals to high concentrations and total daily amounts
of the agent being tested in an effort to elicit a response.
Overall, the minimal observations reported in sucralose
dietary and gavage studies are significant, since substan-
ces that show carcinogenic activity in standard 104-wk
studies usually display some evidence of tissue perturba-
tion in subchronic toxicity testing. In contrast, the sucra-
lose studies revealed no evidence of changes that might
be considered preneoplastic.
In the 4- and 8-wk sucralose dietary studies, but not
the oral gavage studies, rats in the highest diet group
(5%, »5,000 mg/kg body weight/day) gained statistically
significantly less weight and consumed less food than
control animals likely owing to the decreased palatability
of the food (87).
Chronic toxicity studies
In a two-phase chronic toxicity–carcinogenicity study in
rats (93), sucralose was provided in the diet at 0, 3000,
10000, and 30000 ppm, equivalent to an average lifetime
daily sucralose intake of 0, 150, 1000, and 1500 mg/kg
body weight, respectively. In the chronic toxicity phase,
rats received the diet for 52 wk. In the carcinogenicity
phase, rats received the diet for 104 wk, considered a life-
time exposure. In both phases of the study, sucralose had
no effect on the survival, clinical symptoms, or behavior
of the rats, or in the carcinogenic potential of sucralose.
Non-neoplastic findings consistent with aging of the rats
were observed and were not increased in incidence or
severity with sucralose dosing. There was no evidence of
any neoplasia or type, distribution, or multiplicity of
tumors associated with the sucralose treatment. Rats
receiving sucralose in the diet did have a lower body
weight gain and lower food consumption than control
animals—consistent with palatability effects and with 4-
and 8-wk dietary studies (Table 2).
In a 104-wk carcinogenicity study in mice (94), sucra-
lose was provided in the diet at 0, 3000, 10000, and
30000 ppm, equivalent to an average lifetime daily sucra-
lose intake of 0, 450, 1500, and 4500 mg/kg body weight.
Sucralose had no effect on survival, clinical condition, or
behavior of the mice nor were there any gross physical
abnormalities. Likewise, there was no evidence of benign
or malignant neoplasms, or increases in total number of
tumor bearing mice associated with sucralose dosing.
Like rats in the 104-wk study, mice had non-neoplastic
findings consistent with aging mice, but mostly similar
in incidence and severity as controls. Female mice receiv-
ing the highest dose had peripheral blood erythrocyte
counts 7–9% lower than controls. This change was not
observed in males and considered unlikely to be a direct
effect of sucralose (94) (Table 2).
In the 52-wk chronic toxicity study in dogs, there
were no sucralose-related histological changes despite
the use of high (up to 3%) dietary concentrations

 or
intakes
up
to

body
weight/day. The lack of histological changes after 52 wk
of high-dose administration is not consistent with sub-
stances that are carcinogenic (95).
The sum of these chronic toxicity studies, even in the
absence of carcinogenicity studies on sucralose, provides
a strong basis from which to conclude, a priori, that
sucralose is without carcinogenic potential.
In summary, regulatory compliant investigations in
animal models revealed no evidence suggesting that even
extremely high doses of sucralose will produce carcino-
genicity. There were also no signs of toxicity that might
support a concern for potential carcinogenic or other
safety risk.
Other studies
Studies in rats and rabbits showed an absence of effect on
fetal growth or development at doses up to 2,000 mg/kg
body weight/day and 1,000 mg/kg body weight/day,
respectively. In the rabbit study, maternal gastrointesti-
nal effects were observed; however, these were consid-
ered to be a recognized species-specific response to
poorly absorbed substances (50). Sucralose was found to
be nonteratogenic—with no effect on skeletal formation
or organogenesis.
In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
13-wk study, healthy human adults ingested increasing
amounts of sucralose: 125 mg daily for 3 wk, followed by
250 mg daily for 4 wk and then 500 mg daily for 5 wk
(86). Tolerance was assessed through hematology, uri-
nalysis, and biochemical analyses and ECGs, conducted
prior to and at the end of the study, including a detailed
ophthalmological examination in a subset of the subjects.
Three subjects withdrew from the study for personal rea-
sons, but not due to adverse reactions. Hematological,
biochemical, and urinanalysis values remained stable;
ECG readings were not affected; and ophthalmoscopic
tests identified no abnormalities attributable to sucralose.
None of the biochemical data indicated an issue of con-
cern relative to carcinogenicity.
Human epidemiology studies are not typically con-
ducted in the absence of data suggesting a possible effect
of a substance on human health. There have been, how-
ever, two human epidemiology studies on cancer inci-
dence in persons exposed to NNS since the first
regulatory approval permitting sucralose use in foods
(1991) (Table 3). While these studies were focused on
aspartame, the study findings are related to NNSs, and,
thus, could be considered, without due review, applicable
to sucralose. Review of both of these studies, however,
reveals that subjects in the studies would have had little
to no exposure to sucralose, due to the time frame during
which the studies were conducted. Notably, these studies
included evaluation for the loosely defined category of
non-Hodgkins lymphoma (NHL) rather than for a spe-
cific, molecular/cytogenetic characterized form of lym-
phoma, which limits their interpretation with regard to
carcinogenic risk determination.
In the Cancer Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort
study, a prospective study of the incidence of cancer and
mortality in the US begun in 1999, subject recall was
used to monitor the daily consumption of sugar-sweet-
ened and artificially sweetened beverages (96). Subjects
provided follow-up information every 2 yr over the
course of 10 yr. Neither sugar-sweetened nor artificially
sweetened carbonated beverages were associated with an
increased risk of NHL, or subtypes of NHL during the
10-yr follow-up.

 Professionals Follow-up Study, subject recall was used to
monitor daily consumption of sodas (97). Subjects pro-
vided follow-up information every 2 yr over the course
of 22 yr. In this cohort, a higher risk of NHL and multi-
ple myeloma was observed in men who consumed sugar-
sweetened sodas; no association was observed in women
for NHL.
These studies, although not designed to test for a
potential relationship of sucralose, specifically, to cancer,
do not add any evidence that sucralose might be
carcinogenic.
An older study of sucralose conducted by the Ramaz-
zini Institute (RI) was published after this review was
completed. It reported an increased incidence of certain
tumors, notably hematopoietic tumors, in male Swiss
mice (98). The design of the study was similar to other
carcinogenicity studies conducted by the RI (99,100) and
has previously been considered to be the one that can
lead to erroneous conclusions (101). Historically, RI
studies have posed other difficulties: the accuracy of his-
topathologic diagnosis of hematopoietic neoplasms and
the uncertain relevance to humans of such findings in
mice (101,102). The appropriateness of the statistical
analyses used by RI has also been questioned (101,103).
Conclusions
International regulatory authorities consider physico-
chemical characteristics; toxicological and biochemical
profiling, and carcinogenicity testing results; and specific
additional testing (e.g., allergy, cognitive functioning) as
needed in their risk assessment of a substance intended
for human consumption and their decision to approve
or ban the substance. This type of rigorous risk assess-
ment resulted in sucralose being permitted for use by the
US FDA and numerous other prominent regulatory
authorities/agencies from other countries—including the
Joint Food and Agricultural Organization/World Health
Organization (FAO/WHO) Expert Committee on Food
Additives, Health Canada, the Japanese Ministry of
Health and Welfare, the Scientific Committee on Food,
the European Union, and the Food Standards of Aus-
tralia and New Zealand (53–55,104–108).
The chemical structure of sucralose predicts a low
order of reactivity, no biotransformation potential, and no
identified structural alerts for genotoxic or carcinogenic
activity. Stability testing shows sucralose is remarkably
resistant to both chemical and enzymatic degradation.
The results of in vitro and in vivo assays of sucralose
revealed no confirmed genotoxic activity, consistent with
the chemical structure and metabolism of sucralose.
Following ingestion, sucralose is not metabolized in
the gut and approximately 85% of sucralose is excreted
intact. The small amount absorbed is not metabolized to
reactive intermediates and neither the parent molecule
nor metabolites react with biological macromolecules
(e.g., DNA). The small percentage of sucralose that
undergoes metabolism is not catabolized (broken down),
but is biotransformed to glucuronide conjugates that are
toxicologically and biologically insignificant.
Sucralose was tested at doses up to 50,000 ppm, the
maximum dose the FDA recommends for any com-
pound due to the potential for nutrition impact at higher
exposure levels. The FDA established an NOEL of 1.0%
sucralose in the diet, equivalent to about 500 mg/kg
body weight/day and the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Com-
mittee on Food Additives established an “Acceptable
Daily Intake” (ADI) of 0–15 mg/kg body weight/day.
In some animal toxicity studies, certain effects on the
thymus and spleen were observed at high doses. How-
ever, these findings appear to be an indirect effect related
to diet palatability and/or potential nutritional impact. It
is also important to keep in mind that, in these studies,
sucralose daily intakes were equivalent in sweetness to
74–495 pounds of sugar per day for an average weight
(e.g., 75 kg) adult—and hence clearly not representative
of any anticipated human intake. Subsequent studies spe-
cifically assessed immune system cells, tissues, and

 function and supported an NOEL of 3,000 mg/kg body
weight/day. Likewise, teratogenic and developmental
studies in animals showed no effects related to sucralose.
Randomized, double-blind clinical trials conducted over
a period of approximately 3 mo in which sucralose was
consumed daily in amounts greater than the maximum
EDI showed that sucralose was well-tolerated and with-
out evidence of toxicity or other changes that might sug-
gest a potential for carcinogenic effects (86,109).
In summary, review of the evidence retrieved, includ-
ing key studies recommended by international regulatory
bodies and toxicology experts, confirm that sucralose is
noncarcinogenic and safe to ingest. Sucralose does not
demonstrate carcinogenic activity even when exposure
levels are several orders of magnitude greater than the
range of anticipated daily ingestion levels.
