 ABSTRACT 
23 
Background: Polysaccharides from marine sources offer diverse therapeutic 
24 
functions due to their multifarious biological nature. Polysaccharide from Gracilaria 
25 
lemaneiformis possesses various bioactive functions, but its anti-allergic activity 
26 
remains incompletely defined. 
27 
Objective: This study aimed to extract and analyze sulfated polysaccharide from 
28 
Gracilaria lemaneiformis (GLSP), investigate the effects of GLSP on the anti-allergic 
29 
activity in both animal and cell models, and explore its anti-allergic mechanisms. 
30 
Methods: GLSP was obtained by water extraction, ethyl alcohol deposition, and 
31 
column chromatography. Tropomyosin (TM)-sensitized mice were treated with GLSP 
32 
intragastrically for the prevention group and the treatment group. The effects of GLSP 
33 
on the function of IgE-mediated RBL-2H3 and the activation of KU812 cell lines 
34 
were also investigated. Finally, the inhibition of signaling molecules by GLSP was 
35 
detected through Western blot and Proteome assays. 
36 
Results: GLSP was a 152,481 Da sulfated polysaccharose composed of galactose. 
37 
GLSP could alleviate allergy symptoms, effectively reduce TM-specific IgE and IgG1, 
38 
decrease the levels of histamine and mMCP-1, suppress Th2 cell polarization, and 
39 
promote the function of regulatory T cells in mice. In addition, GLSP had the ability 
40 
to inhibit the function of RBL-2H3 cells. And the sulfate of GLSP inhibited 
41 
degranulation. Meanwhile, the expression of CD63 and CD203c were reduced by 
42 
GLSP in activated KU812 cells. GLSP inhibited the activation of KU812 via 
43 
suppressing Syk and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK). 
44 
 Conclusion: Immunosuppression as well as the reduction in the levels of Syk and p38 
45 
MAPK may contribute to the ability of GLSP to suppress the symptoms of food 
46 
allergy. The sulfate of GLSP may play an important role in the anti-allergic effect.

 INTRODUCTION 
67 
Food allergy is a rapidly growing public health concern because of its increasing 
68 
prevalence and life-threatening potential. On the basis of numerous studies, food 
69 
allergy is an immune provocation by food in susceptible individuals that affects nearly 
70 
8% of children and 5% of adults, with growing evidence of an increase in prevalence.1 
71 
As a kind of food allergy, shellfish allergy in the Asia-Pacific region ranks among the 
72 
highest in the world and is the most common cause of food-induced anaphylaxis.2 In 
73 
china, 16.7% of the rural population is sensitized to shellfish.3 Tropomyosin (TM) has 
74 
been identified as the major allergen of shellfish.4 We have previously demonstrated 
75 
that TM is an allergen in crab, which can cause adverse hypersensitivity in a mouse 
76 
model.5 
77 
Food-induced anaphylaxis is an IgE-mediated Type I hypersensitivity reaction and 
78 
is characterized by the development and activation of T helper 2 (Th2) cells.1 After 
79 
activation by allergens, the subset of CD4 (+) T-lymphocytes produce a spectrum of 
80 
cytokines like IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-9, and IL-13 that cause induction of serum 
81 
immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels, which, in turn, mediate the clinical symptoms.6 The 
82 
IgE immunoglobulin attaches with Fragment crystallizable epsilon region Receptor 1 
83 
(FcεR1) of mast cells or basophils. Mast cells and basophils are key effector cells, 
84 
which can release cytokines, chemokines, proteases, leukotrienes and bioactive 
85 
polyamines after activation.7, 8 The activation of mast cells and basophils involves a 
86 
complex network of signal transduction pathways and molecules, including various 
87 
tyrosine kinases, Akt, and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs).9 MAPKs 
88 
 signaling cascades are important in the differentiation, activation, proliferation, 
89 
degranulation, and migration of various immune cells, including basophils and mast 
90 
cells.10 MAPKs signaling modules are divided into at least three groups: extracelluar 
91 
signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p38 MAPK, and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK). In 
92 
addition, Regulatory (Treg) cells which known as suppressor T cells can alleviate 
93 
clinical signs of hypersensitivity to dietary food allergen by modulating the priming of 
94 
allergen-specific T and B cell responses during oral sensitization and mast cell 
95 
degranulation.11 
96 
The indigenous people often have a diet of marine algae and shellfish in the 
97 
southeast coast of China. Marine algae are known to be one of the most important 
98 
producers of biomass in the marine environment. Traditional Chinese medicine books 
99 
have documented that marine algae could improve digestion, enhance immunity and 
100 
other effects. Recently, the role of marine algae as anti-allergic agents has been 
101 
determined in vitro and in vivo. 12 In a recent study, Lin et al. 13 demonstrated that 
102 
Laminaria japonica polysaccharides can significantly inhibit airway inflammation of 
103 
asthmatic mice, adjust the balance of cytokines, and improve the pulmonary 
104 
histopathological condition. Ishihara et al. 14 reported that porphyran of red algae 
105 
Porphyra tenera and P. yezoensis were capable of inhibiting the contact 
106 
hypersensitivity reaction via decreasing the serum level of IgE in Balb/c mice. Our 
107 
previous studies also have demonstrated that sulfated polysaccharide purified from 
108 
Porphyra haitanensis (PHPS) which is composed of galactose and sulfate has an 
109 
anti-allergic activity by suppressing Th2 immune response in the TM-sensitized mice. 
110 
 15 Gracilaria lemaneiformis has similar polysaccharide content and is as extensively 
111 
distributed as Porphyra haitanensis. It is distributed widely in a marine environment 
112 
and belongs to the family Gracilariaceae (Rhodophyta). Gracilaria lemaneiformis 
113 
possesses various bioactive functions such as antitumor, antiviral, hypoglycemic, and 
114 
immunomodulatory effects.16,17,18 However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no 
115 
studies reported on the anti-allergic activity of the sulfated polysaccharides from 
116 
Gracilaria lemaneiformis, . 
117 
In this study, the structural characteristics of sulfated polysaccharide isolated from 
118 
Gracilaria lemaneiformis (GLSP) were resolved. The anti-allergic activity of GLSP 
119 
was evaluated by TM-sensitized mice and cellular models. Moreover, the key 
120 
functional group of GLSP was shown for anti-allergic effect, and the inhibition of 
121 
GLSP on signaling pathway was further investigated in basophils. 
122 
 
123 
METHODS 
124 
Purification of polysaccharide from Gracilaria lemaneiformis  
125 
Gracilaria lemaneiformis was provided by the Third Institute of Oceanography, 
126 
State Oceanic Administration. Polysaccharide from Gracilaria lemaneiformis was 
127 
extracted and purified according to the procedures of Shi et al.15 by 95℃ water 
128 
extraction, ethyl alcohol deposition, and DEAE-cellulose 52 (Whatman, New York, 
129 
USA) column chromatography. The carbohydrate content of the polysaccharide was 
130 
detected by the anthrone-sulfuric acid method. 19 The lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was 
131 
removed from the polysaccharide with Detoxi-Gel Endotoxin Removing Gel (Pierce, 
132 
 Rockford, USA). The LPS content of the polysaccharide was found to be < 0.03 
133 
EU/mg as measured by the Limulus amebocyte lysate assay (Associates of Cape Cod, 
134 
New York, USA). 
135 
Characterization of polysaccharide from Gracilaria lemaneiformis 
136 
Carbohydrate was quantified by the anthrone -sulfuric acid method using galactose 
137 
as the standard. The 3,6-anhydrogalactose (3,6-AG), sulfate, uronic acid and protein 
138 
contents were respectively measured according the description by Shi et al.15 The 
139 
molecular weight distribution of the polysaccharide was determined by high 
140 
performance gel-permeation chromatography (HPGPC) (Agilent-1100, Santa Clara, 
141 
USA) equipped with a ZORBAX Eclipse XDB-C18 column (250 mm ×4.6 mm, 
142 
column temperature 30°C). To determine the monosaccharide composition of GLSP, 
143 
the acid hydrolysate of the polysaccharide was applied to ion chromatography (IC) 
144 
(ICS-3000, Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) analysis with CarboPac PA20 (3×150 mm), 
145 
and separated using 0.25 M NaOH at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. Fourier transform 
146 
infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectrum of the polysaccharide was collected with a 
147 
Fourier transformed infrared spectrometer (VECTOR-22, BRUKER) in the wave 
148 
number range of 4000-500 cm−1 using the KBr-disk method. 
149 
Mouse food allergy model 
150 
Female BALB/c mice, 4-6 weeks of age, were obtained from the Animal Center of 
151 
Xiamen University. Mice were housed in ana Specefic Pathogen Free (SPF) (define 
152 
SPF) environment maintained at 22±1°C with a relative humidity of 55±10%, and 
153 
experiments were performed in conformity with the laws and regulations for

 treatment of live animals in Jimei University, SCXK 2012-0005. 
155 
The purification of TM from mud crab (Scylla paramamosain) was carried out as 
156 
described previously.20 Food allergy was induced in mice and monitored as described 
157 
by Yamaki et al.21 Briefly, mice were immunized with TM (50μg/mouse) in 
158 
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) emulsified with Imject Alum (Thermo Fisher 
159 
Scientific Inc. Waltham, MA, USA) at day 0 and 14. Mice were challenged from day 
160 
28 by oral administration TM (10 mg/mouse) every other day. The negative control 
161 
mice were given 0.2 mL of intragastric PBS (unimmunized PBS group). GLSP (5 
162 
mg/mouse) was orally administered to immunized mice from the day before the 1st 
163 
challenge to the day before sacrifice (from day 27 to day 40) in the prevention group. 
164 
And in the treatment group, GLSP (5 mg/mouse) was orally administered to mice 
165 
already challenged with oral TM 3 times (from day 33 to day 40) to evaluate the 
166 
therapeutic effect of GLSP on food allergy. Anaphylactic symptoms and diarrhea rates 
167 
(the proportion of diarrheal mice in each group) were scored for 1 h after each 
168 
challenges.22 Rectal temperatures were measured 1 h after the 6th challenge and sera 
169 
was collected. 
170 
Measure the production of histamine, mMCP-1, TM-specific antibodies, and 
171 
cytokines 
172 
The concentrations of histamine and mMCP-1 in serum obtained 1 h after the 6th 
173 
challenge was determined using commercially available ELISA kits following the 
174 
manufacturer's instructions (IBL, Hamburg, Germany; TSZ, Boston, USA). Serum 
175 
levels of anti-TM IgG2a, IgE, and IgG1 were measured using ELISA as described 
176 
Formatted
 previously.15 Splenocyte suspensions were obtained on day 41, and were cultured with 
177 
TM (10μg/mL) for 3 days to measure the release of cytokines IL 4, IL-13, interferon 
178 
(IFN)-γ, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β) using ELISA kits following the 
179 
manufacturer's instructions (R&D Systems, Minneapoils, MN, USA). 
180 
RNA preparation and real-time RT-PCR analysis 
181 
RNA preparation and real-time RT-PCR were performed according to the previous 
182 
description.23 Real-time quantitative PCR (QPCR) was performed with the following 
183 
primers: β-actin (5’- AGC TGC GTT TTA CAC CCT TT-3’; 5’- AAG CCA TGC 
184 
CAA TGT TGT CT -3’), T-bet (5’- CCC CTG TCC AGT CAG TAA CTT -3’; 5’- 
185 
CTT CTC TGT TTG GCT GGC T -3’), GATA-3 (5’- AGG AGT CTC CAA GTG 
186 
TGC GAA -3’; 5’- TTG GAA TGC AGA CAC CAC CT -3’), Foxp3 (5’- CTC ATG 
187 
ATA GTG CCT GTG TCC TCA A -3’; 5’- AGG GCC AGC ATA GGT GCA AG -3’). 
188 
Western blot analysis 
189 
Western blot analysis of serum anti-TM IgG2a, IgE, and IgG1 was performed as 
190 
described previously.22 The detection of Syk (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, 
191 
MA, USA), phosphor-Syk (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA), and 
192 
β-actin (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) of activated KU812 cells 
193 
with or without GLSP pretreatment were performed according the description by 
194 
Lee.24 
195 
RBL-2H3 assay 
196 
 The release of β-hexosaminidase and histamine by RBL-2H3 cell was measured 
197 
as a model of IgE-mediated mast cell allergic reaction. Meanwhile, the cell toxicity, 
198 
Formatted: Not Highlight
 reactive oxygen species (ROS) (define ROS)  and cytokines (IL-4 and TNF-α) were 
199 
described previously.23 A solvolytic desulfation procedure was used wherein the 
200 
GLSP as a pyridinium salt was heated in dimethyl sulfoxide.25 The effect of GLSP 
201 
after desulfation on degranulation were measured to verify the role of sulfate. 
202 
Flow cytometry assay 
203 
To examine the effects of GLSP on the expression of activation-linked antigens, 
204 
flow cytometry experiments were performed. KU812 cells were incubated with GLSP 
205 
(10-200μg/mL) for 1 h and then(or?) stimulated with 0.5μM Calcium Ionophore 
206 
A23187 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) plus 1μM Phorbol Myristate Acetate (PMA) 
207 
(Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 30 min in tyrode’s buffer. Then, cells were stained 
208 
with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated CD63 (BD pharmingen, San diego, 
209 
CA) and phycoerythrin (PE)-labelled CD203c (BD pharmingen, San diego, CA) by 
210 
signal-colour flow cytometry. Guava easyCyte 6HT system and GuavaSoft software 
211 
(Millipore, Massachusetts, USA) were used for the analysis. 
212 
Proteome ProfilerTM array 
213 
KU812 cells were incubated with GLSP (200μg/mL) for 1 h and then stimulated 
214 
with 0.5μM A23187 plus 1μM PMA for 30 min in tyrode’s buffer. Then cells were 
215 
lysed and Rrelative phosphorylation levels of all three major families of MAPK 
216 
(ERK1/2, p38α/β/δ/γ, JNK1/2/3/pan) and Akt 1/2/3/pan, RSK1/2, GSK-3α/β, MSK2, 
217 
MEK3/6, HSP27 as well as p70 S6 kinase were determined by human 
218 
phospho-MAPK array (R&D Systems, Minneapoils, MN, USA) according to the 
219 
manufactures’ instructions (need a description of what you incubated with the array

 and how it was prepared). 
221 
Statistical analysis 
222 
Data were presented as means ± SDs. Differences between means were analyzed by 
223 
using ANOVA. A p value of less than 0.05 was set as a significant criterion. Each 
224 
experiment was repeated at least 3 times. In the animal model study samples from 
225 
individual mice were processed and analyzed separately. 
226 
 
227 
RESULTS 
228 
Composition of polysaccharide from Gracilaria lemaneiformis 
229 
The 3, 6-AG, sulfate, uronic acid and protein contents of GLSP were 8.23%, 11.3%, 
230 
8.59%, and 0.98%, respectively. The molecular weight of GLSP was 152,481 Da by 
231 
HPLC analysis (data not shown)(data not shown?). According to the description by 
232 
Sun et al.,26 the peak at 31.963 min was the galactose standard, and the 
233 
monosaccharide in GLSP was galactose determined through IC analysis as shown in 
234 
Fig. 1a (the Fig1a description is too brief). The FTIR spectrum of the sample was 
235 
shown in Fig. 1b. GLSP exhibited absorption peaks at 3289 cm-1, 2920 cm-1and 1070 
236 
cm-1, which were characteristic absorptions of -OH, C-H and C-O, respectively.27 The 
237 
IR absorption at 931cm-1 was the characteristic absorption of 3, 6-AG. Infrared 
238 
spectroscopy provided useful information for the position of sulfate groups of 
239 
polysaccharide. The IR spectra show an absorption band at 1260 cm-1 and 850 cm-1, 
240 
indicating the presence of the total sulfate ester. 28 So this polysaccharide was defined 
241 
as a sulfated polysaccharide from Gracilaria lemaneiformis (GLSP).

 The anesis of anaphylaxis by GLSP in TM-sensitized mice 
243 
To test the effect of GLSP on food allergy, the animal experiment was implemented 
244 
according the protocol shown in Fig. 2a. Daily dose of GLSP moderately decreased 
245 
the scores of the anaphylactic response (Fig. 2b) and diarrhea rates (Fig. 2c) in a 
246 
dose-dependent manner for 1 h after the every 3rd-6th challenge (this is first mention 
247 
on Diarrhea rates, need to add to methods). The average rectal temperature of TM 
248 
group mice was 35.5°C that was 2°C less than PBS group mice. Hypothermia induced 
249 
at the 6th challenge was also remitted by the administration of GLSP in 
250 
GLSP-preventive (p<0.01) and GLSP-treatment (p<0.05) group mice (Fig. 2d) (this 
251 
figure needs better description of the data. For example, what is on the Y axis vs the x 
252 
axis? Are there any error bars? Does each line involve one mouse? How was diarrheal 
253 
treatment effect on food allergy. Meanwhile, GLSP diminished the increase in 
254 
histamine and mMCP-1 serum concentrations,  (which indicates basophil 
255 
degranulation?) after the 6th challenge in the GLSP-prevention group (Fig. 3a, 3b). In 
256 
addition, the daily administration of GLSP significantly reduced anti-TM IgE (Fig. 3c) 
257 
and IgG1 (Fig. 3d) serum levels, but did not anti-TM IgG2a (Fig.  3c,3d,3e). The 
258 
western blot result was similar to the ELISA data (Fig. 3f). 
259 
The immunosuppression of GLSP in TM-sensitized mice 
260 
GLSP is was known to inhibit the Th2-dependent anti-TM IgE and IgG1 levels, but 
261 
it is was not known if it influencesd TTh1 cells. Therefore, to examine whether T-cell 
262 
polarization in the TM-sensitized mice was modulated by GLSP, we evaluated the 
263 
expression of the transcription factors T-bet, GATA-3 and Foxp3 as the reflection of

 Th1, Th2 and Treg cell activity, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4a, GATA-3 expression 
265 
tended to decrease and Foxp3 expression tended to increase in splenic lymphocytes, 
266 
while T-bet expression was not modulated by GLSP. The results of cytokines secreted 
267 
from TM-stimulated cultured splenic lymphocytes confirmed these observations. 
268 
GLSP reduced the production of Th2 cytokines (IL-4 and IL-13), increased the 
269 
secretion of TGF-β, and had no effect on Th1 cytokine (IFN-γ) (Fig. 4b) (belong in 
270 
discussion). 
271 
The suppression impact of GLSP in IgE-mediated RBL-2H3 cell 
272 
In Fig. 5a, methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay was measured to determine 
273 
the potential cytotoxicity of GLSP alone or conjugated to dinitrophenyl (DNP)-BSA. 
274 
As shown in Fig. 5a, GLSP (20-200 μg/mL) alone or GLSP+DNP-BSA did not affect 
275 
the cell viability (p>0.05).As shown in Fig. 5a, GLSP (20-200 μg/mL) had no 
276 
cytotoxicity (in the results section you have to describe the figure. For example: In 
277 
Figure 5a, we measure cell lysis??….by the release of MTT as a measure of toxicity 
278 
of GSLP alone or conjugated to DNP and the results are reported as the % of 
279 
the….etc). (Also, what MTT is (?!) And there is no mention of toxicity measurements 
280 
or MTT in methods section. What is the significance of using GSLP plus and minus 
281 
DNP conjugation (or is BSA-DNP? In this case also fix the figure). This is important 
282 
information that should also be included in Materials and methods as well as briefly 
283 
described 
here). 
 
GLSP

μg/mL) 
significantly 
diminished 
the 
284 
antigen-induced degranulation as measured by the reduction in the release of

 and ROS (as measured by the fluorescence of 2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein (DCF)) 
287 
were significantly reduced by GLSP (100-200μg/mL) (Define ROS and detail more in 
288 
methods, and here-what are you measuring and what does the figure show?) (Fig. 5c, 
289 
5d). The inhibition of mediator release was also shown to be concentration dependent. 
290 
IL-4 and TNF-α are important cytokines in allergic inflammation.29 The IL-4 and 
291 
TNF-α levels were increased by treatment of RBHL-2H3  cells with 500 ng/ml 
292 
dinitrophenyl (DNP) -BSA. Fig. 5e and Fig. 5f demonstrated that GLSP significantly 
293 
inhibited the secretion of IL-4 and TNF-α in a dose-dependent manner in DNP-BSA 
294 
treated stimulatedIgE-mediated RBL-2H3 cells. These indexes had no significant

difference between cells stimulated with GLSP (200 μg/mL) alone and 
296 
PBS-stimulated cells (data not shown)., The data in Table 1 indicated that GLSP after 
297 
desulfurization could not inhibit the degranulation of RBL-2H3. Thus, these results 
298 
indicate that the activation and function of RBL-23H3 cells were inhibited by GLSP, 
299 
and the sulfate of GLSP plays a crucial role. 
300 
The inhibitory effect of GLSP on the activation of KU812 cells 
301 
Flow cytometry was used to assess the activation of KU812 cells (Fig 6). GLSP 
302 
was found to counteract the expression of CD63 in KU812 cells that were activated 
303 
by A23187+ plus PMA (A+P) treatment (??what is A+P?) at 20-200 μg/mL in a 
304 
concentration dependent manner (Fig. 6a). Significantly less effect was seen by GLSP 
305 
on A23187 plus PMA  stimulated up-regulation of CD203c (Fig. 6b). As shown in 
306 
Fig. 6c, in flow cytometric measurements GLSP was demonstrated to block the 
307 
formation of the CD63+ (top panel) and reduce the expression of CD203c+ (bottom 
308

 panel) subpopulations of KU812 cells. GLSP after desulfation could not inhibit the 
309 
expression of CD63 and CD203c in KU812 cells (data not shown). 
310 
The hindering effect of GLSP on the phosphorylation levels of distinct signaling 
311 
molecules in KU812 cells 
312 
To gain insight into how GLSP suppressed the activation of basophils, we 
313 
examined its effects on signaling events, specifically the phospho-activation of 
314 
tyrosine kinase like Syk, MAPKs and serine/threonine kinases like Akt. Antigen 
315 
(what is the antigen?, TM)-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk was inhibited by 
316 
GLSP in KU812 cells (Fig. 7a). As shown in Fig. 7a,This figure is not very clear. It 
317 
needs to be described better, for example, the p-SYK Syk levels is were increased 
318 
cells are were pre treated with 0.2 mg/mLl of GLSP, the pSYK p-Syk levels are were 
319 
decreased to no A+P activation. No significangt change is was seen in the levels of 
320 
and unphosphorylated Syk with the various treatments. We analyzed other signaling 
321 
molecules using a Proteome ProfilerTM Array is detecting 26 kinases simultaneously 
322 
(Fig. 7b). Though measuring the total proteins in the cytoplasm of the KU812 cells 
323

DISCUSSION 
333 
During the last decade, the active ingredients of marine algae, such as 
334 
olysaccharides, phlorotannins, phycocyanins, carotenoids etc, play an important role 
335 
in the pharmaceutical industry and the development of novel drugs against allergic 
336 
disorders.12 Polysaccharides from marine sources offer diverse therapeutic regulated 
337 
functions of allergic responses due to their biocompatible, biodegradablenontoxic, and 
338 
physiologically inert properties.30  (should include at least one review article as a 
339 
reference or multiple references). It has been reported that several marine 
340 
polysaccharides have been found to modulate allergic responses.13,14 It was 
341 
demonstrated that the structural characteristics and anti-allergic activity of GLSP are 
342 
similar to PHPS15, a polysaccharide from Porphyra haitanensisin. Gracilaria 
343 
lemaneiformis, is an important murine algae that is mainly cultured near the southeast 
344 
coast of China and is known to contain bioactive material. In the present study, using 
345 
our patented methodology (Patent NO: 201310424569.6), the purified sulfated 
346 
polysaccharide isolated from 
Gracilaria lemaneiformis showed a similar 
347 
monosaccharide composition and sulfate content with PHPS. Fan et al.18 reported that 
348 
the acidic polysaccharide isolated from Gracilaria lemaneiformis showed anti-tumor 
349 
activity, and its molecular weight is 1.37 ×106 Da, which is more than GLSP 
350 
(1.52×105 Da); the sulfate content is 6.13%, which is less than GLSP (11.3%); and the 
351 
main monosaccharide is galactose, which is same as GLSP. These differences might

 result from the different extraction methods and or the distinctlyl different material 
353 
used in the experiment. 
354 
Food allergy is an immunologically adverse reaction caused by food, which 
355 
encompasses a range of disorders including IgE-mediated anaphylaxis, decrease of 
356 
body temperature, and gastrointestinal adverse reaction.1 In this study, a previously 
357 
established food allergic model in mice that were orally sensitized by TM. The 
358 
allergic animal exhibited increase in Th2 cytokine levels, TM-specific IgE 
359 
concentration, serum histamine, and mMCP-1 levels. The present data suggested that 
360 
GLSP had potent effects on the prevention and treatment of allergic diseases, and the 
361 
preventive effect was better than the treatment effect. GSLP was directly responsible 
362 
for the reduction in mMCP-1 release and the serum histamine levels. 
363 
Allergen-specific serum IgE is essential in type I hypersensitivity reactions. The 
364 
Th2- dependent anti-TM IgE and IgG1 serum levels were reduced observably by 
365 
GLSP. In addition, the production of IL-4 and IL-13 was decreased by GLSP. This 
366 
effect was similar to the effect of PHPS, but the difference is that GLSP had no 
367 
obvious effect on Th1 cytokine IFN-γ and Th1-dependent anti-TM IgG2a. The 
368 
expression of Foxp3 in mouse splenic lymphocytes was increased, indicating that 
369 
Treg cell polarization was promoted by GLSP. TGF-β is an important factor in the 
370 
Treg cell development and suppressor function.301 The production of TGF-β was also 
371 
increased in mice challenged with GLSP. So, we belive that GLSP diminishes the 
372 
severity of food anaphylaxis in the TM-sensitized mice through immunosuppression 
373 
by up-regulating Treg cells. Whether GLSP had the influence of Th9, Th17, and other 
374 
 immune cells need to be further investigated. 
375 
Food allergy reaction is induced by the rapid local and systemic release of 
376 
inflammatory mediators such as histamine, serotonin, and various pro-inflammatory 
377 
cytokines from mast cells.312 The concentrations of serum histamine and mMCP-1, 
378 
which is a known inflammatory mediator7 (?) increased by TM-sensitization of mice 
379 
were inhibited by GLSP. So the effect of GLSP on the activation and function of 
380 
basophils were further investigated by RBL-2H3 and KU812 cell lines. IL-4 which is 
381 
thought to contribute to immunoglobulin class switching in B cells to produce IgE323 
382 
is also reported to induce Th2 differentiation334 and affect the survival/proliferation of 
383 
MCs mast cells(define MCs) leading to allergic diathesis.345 The activation of human 
384 
basophils is associated with up-regulation of various surface CD-antigens, including 
385 
CD63 and CD203c.35,36,37 The present results showed that GLSP had the ability to 
386 
suppress the degranulation and the production of histamine, ROS, IL-4, and TNF-α in 
387 
IgE-mediated RBL-2H3. The expression of CD63 and CD203c were also inhibited by 
388 
GLSP in KU812 cells. Furthermore, just as the reported by Ngo et al.378 sulfated 
389 
polysaccharides, from marine algae, could act as bioactive agents, and the sulfate of 
390 
GLSP was shown to be important in the inhibition of mediator release and cytokine 
391 
secretion by of RBL-2H3 and KU812 cells. 
392 
Syk deficient mast cells do not degranulate after FcεRI aggregation, Syk is essential 
393 
for FcεRI induced signal transduction of mast cells.389 The activation of Syk and other 
394 
tyrosine kinases initiates an intracellular signaling cascade involving activation of 
395 
MAPKs, Akt, and other molecules, which have been implicated in gene expression of 
396

Formatted
 relevant cytokines.3409 The p38 MAPK play an important role in anaphylactic reaction 
397 
in humans, and all four isoforms of p38 (α, β, γ and δ) can be activated by MEK6; 
398 
p38α and p38β are also activated by MEK3.401 RSK is a known downstream target of 
399 
ERK1/ERK2.401 Research has shown that camellia japonica suppressed allergic 
400 
response 
by 
the 
inhibition 
of 
Syk 
kinase 
activation 
in 
mast 
cells,23  
401 
homoisoflavanone prevented mast cell activation and allergic responses by inhibition 
402 
of Syk signaling pathway,412 and CTB glycoprotein reduced arachidonic acid release, 
403 
COX-2 expression, and activator protein-1 transcriptional activation through p38 
404 
MAPK phosphorylation in RBL-2H3 cells.423 In the present study, GLSP inhibited the 
405 
phosphorylation of Syk tyrosine kinase, Akt, and MEK3/6, as well as P38δ. Due to 
406 
the inhibition of these signaling pathway molecules, GLSP may be able to counteract 
407 
the activation and function of basophils. It could be speculated that the mechanism of 
408 
the inhibitory effect on mast cells is similar to basophils, and should be studied 
409 
further. 
410 
In conclusion, the present study show that purified GLSP was a 152,481 Da 
411 
sulfated polysaccharide from Gracilaria lemaneiformis. GLSP could alleviate the 
412 
allergic symptoms of TM-sensitized mice by immunosuppression and the inhibition of 
413 
basophils. The activation of basophil was inhibited by GLSP via Syk and p38 MAPK 
414 
signaling pathways. Based on the results in vivo and vitro, we believe that GLSP 
415 
could not only inhibit TM- mediated food allergy, but also reduce the severity of other 
416 
allergic symptoms. Finally, GLSP may provide insight into the prevention or 
417 
treatment of food allergy induced-anaphylaxis and may be used as a functional food 
418 
 component or active pharmaceutical ingredient to treat allergic patients.

Fig. 3. The inhibition of GLSP on serum histamine, mMCP-1, TM-specific antibodies in mice 
566 
(a) GLSP reduced the histamine levels in the prevention group; 
567 
(b) GLSP reduced the mMCP-1 levels in the prevention and the treatment group; 
568 
(c) GLSP inhibited serum TM-specific IgE in the prevention group after the last challenge; 
569 
(d) GLSP inhibited serum TM-specific IgG1 in the prevention group after the last challenge; 
570 
(e) GLSP had no effect on serum TM-specific IgG2a; 
571 
(f) Western blot analysis of the TM-specific antibodies in mice serum after the last challenge. 
572 
 Statistical differences are indicated by P values (one-way ANOVA). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, 
573 
compared with the TM-treated group.

Fig. 4. The regulatory effects of GLSP on T cell polarization in mice 
576 
(a) GLSP suppressed the expression of Th2 transcription factor (GATA-3), promoted the 
577 
expression of Treg transcription factor (Foxp3), and had no effect on Th1 transcription factor 
578 
(T-bet); 
579 
(b) The effects of GLSP on cytokines secreted from Th1, Th2, and Treg cells. GLSP could reduce 
580 
the production of Th2 cytokines (IL-4 and IL-13), increase the production of Treg cytokines 
581 
(TGF-β), and have no effect on Th1 cytokines (IFN-γ). 
582 
Statistical differences are indicated by P values (one-way ANOVA). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, 
583 
compared with the TM-treated group.

Fig. 5. The inhibitory effect of GLSP in IgE-mediated allergic responses in RBL-2H3 
586 
(a) Effects of GLSP on cytotoxicity; 
587 
(b) GLSP (100-200μg/mL) reduced the release rate of β-hexosaminidase; 
588 
(c) GLSP (100-200μg/mL) inhibited the histamine levels; 
589 
(d) GLSP (100-200μg/mL) decreased the production of ROS; 
590 
(e) GLSP (100-200μg/mL) suppressed the secretion of IL-4; 
591 
(f) GLSP (150-200μg/mL) impeded the secretion of TNF-α.

Fig. 6. The inhibitory action of GLSP on the expression of CD63 and CD203c on KU812 cell 
598 
(a) GLSP inhibited the percentage of CD63+ cells, and had slight inhibition of CD203c+ cells; 
599 
(b) The result pictures of the expression of CD63 and CD203c by flow cytometry as an example.

Fig. 7. The adjusted effects of GLSP on the signaling pathway molecules 
602 
(a) GLSP (200μg/mL) reduced the phosphorylation of Syk tyrosine kinase in stimulated KU812 
603 
cells; 
604 
(b) GLSP (200μg/mL) reduced the phosphorylation of Akt, MEK3/6, MAPK p38δ, and RSK2, 
605 
and mildly enhanced the phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2.
