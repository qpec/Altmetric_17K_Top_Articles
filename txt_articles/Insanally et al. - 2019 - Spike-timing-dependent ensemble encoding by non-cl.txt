Abstract Neurons recorded in behaving animals often do not discernibly respond to sensory
input and are not overtly task-modulated. These non-classically responsive neurons are difficult to
interpret and are typically neglected from analysis, confounding attempts to connect neural activity
to perception and behavior. Here, we describe a trial-by-trial, spike-timing-based algorithm to
reveal the coding capacities of these neurons in auditory and frontal cortex of behaving rats.
Classically responsive and non-classically responsive cells contained significant information about
sensory stimuli and behavioral decisions. Stimulus category was more accurately represented in
frontal cortex than auditory cortex, via ensembles of non-classically responsive cells coordinating
the behavioral meaning of spike timings on correct but not error trials. This unbiased approach
allows the contribution of all recorded neurons – particularly those without obvious task-related,
trial-averaged firing rate modulation – to be assessed for behavioral relevance on single trials.

Introduction
Spike trains recorded from the cerebral cortex of behaving animals can be complex, highly variable
from trial-to-trial, and therefore challenging to interpret. A fraction of recorded cells typically exhibit
trial-averaged firing rates with obvious task-related features and can be considered ‘classically
responsive’, such as neurons with tonal frequency tuning in the auditory cortex or orientation tuning
in the visual cortex. Another population of responsive cells are modulated by multiple task

 parameters (‘mixed selectivity cells’) and have recently been shown to have computational advan-
tages necessary for flexible behavior (Rigotti et al., 2013). However, a substantial number of cells
have variable responses that fail to demonstrate firing rates with any obvious trial-averaged relation-
ship to task parameters (Jaramillo and Zador, 2011; Olshausen and Field, 2006; Raposo et al.,
2014; Rodgers and DeWeese, 2014). These ‘non-classically responsive’ neurons are especially prev-
alent in frontal cortical regions but can also be found throughout the brain, including primary sen-
sory cortex (Hroma
´dka et al., 2008; Jaramillo and Zador, 2011; Rodgers and DeWeese, 2014).
These response categories are not fixed but can be dynamic, with some cells apparently becoming
non-classically responsive during task engagement without impairing behavioral performance
(Carcea et al., 2017; Kuchibhotla et al., 2017; Otazu et al., 2009). The potential contribution of
these cells to behavior remains to a large extent unknown and represents a major conceptual chal-
lenge to the field (Olshausen and Field, 2006).
How do these non-classically responsive cells relate to behavioral task variables on single trials?
While there are sophisticated approaches for dissecting the precise correlations between classically
responsive cells and task structure (Erlich et al., 2011; Jaramillo and Zador, 2011; Kiani and Shad-
len, 2009; Murakami et al., 2014; Raposo et al., 2014), there is still a need for complementary and
straightforward analytical tools for understanding any and all activity patterns encountered
(Jaramillo and Zador, 2011; Raposo et al., 2014; Rigotti et al., 2013). Moreover, most behavioral
tasks produce dynamic activity patterns throughout multiple neural circuits, but we lack unified
methods to compare activity across different regions, and to determine to what extent these neu-
rons might individually or collectively perform task-relevant computations. To address these limita-
tions, we devised a novel trial-to-trial analysis using Bayesian inference that evaluates the extent to
which relative spike timing in single-unit and ensemble responses encode behavioral task variables.
eLife digest Neurons encode information in the form of electrical signals called spikes. Certain
neurons increase the rate at which they produce spikes under specific circumstances, e.g., whenever
an animal hears a particular sound. These neurons are said to be ’classically responsive’. But not all
neurons behave in this way. Others produce spikes at a variable rate that does not obviously relate
to the animal’s behavior. These neurons are said to be ’non-classically responsive’. They are often
omitted from analyses, despite typically outnumbering their classically responsive counterparts. So,
what are these neurons doing?
To find out, Insanally et al. trained rats to respond to sounds. The animals learned to poke their
nose into a window whenever they heard a specific tone, and to avoid responding whenever they
heard any other tone. As the rats performed the task, Insanally et al. recorded from neurons in two
areas of the brain, the frontal cortex and the auditory cortex. A computer then analyzed the activity
of individual neurons during each trial.
As expected, the firing rate of non-classically responsive cells did not relate to the animals’
behavior. But the timing of this firing did. The interval between spikes contained information about
which tone the animals had heard and/or how they had responded. The cells worked together in
groups to encode this information. Over the course of each trial, every neuron in the group varied
the interval between its spikes. Eventually, the group reached a consensus, with all neurons using
the same interval to represent information relevant to the task. Groups of neurons in the frontal
cortex encoded more information about the category of the tone than those in the auditory cortex.
By including all neurons – both classically and non-classically responsive – this model offers a
more comprehensive view of how neural activity relates to behavior. This may in turn help us
understand the variable and complex neural activity seen in people with sensory and cognitive
disorders.

Non-classically responsive cells prevalent in auditory and frontal cortex
during behavior
We trained 15 rats on an audiomotor frequency recognition go/no-go task (Carcea et al., 2017;
Froemke et al., 2013; King et al., 2016; Martins and Froemke, 2015) that required them to nose
poke to a single target tone for food reward and withhold from responding to other non-target
tones (Figure 1A). Tones were 100 ms in duration presented sequentially once every 5–8 s at 70 dB
sound pressure level (SPL); the target tone was 4 kHz and non-target tones ranged from 0.5 to 32
kHz separated by one octave intervals. After a few weeks of training, rats had high hit rates to target
tones and low false alarm rates to non-targets, leading to high d’ values (mean performance shown
in Figure 1B; each individual rat included in this study shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 1).
To correctly perform this task, animals must first recognize the stimulus and then execute an
appropriate motor response. We hypothesized that two brain regions important for this behavior
are the auditory cortex (AC) and frontal cortical area 2 (FR2). Many but not all auditory cortical neu-
rons respond to pure tones with reliable, short-latency phasic responses (Hroma
´dka et al., 2008;
Hubel et al., 1959; Kadia and Wang, 2003; Merzenich et al., 1975; Polley et al., 2007; Wehr and
Zador, 2003; Yaron et al., 2012). These neurons can process sound in a dynamic and context-sensi-
tive manner, and AC cells are also modulated by expectation, attention, and reward structure,
strongly suggesting that AC responses are important for auditory perception and cognition
(David et al., 2012; Fritz et al., 2003; Hubel et al., 1959; Jaramillo and Zador, 2011; Wein-
berger, 2007). Previously, we found that the go/no-go tone recognition task used here is sensitive
to AC neuromodulation and plasticity (Froemke et al., 2013). In contrast, FR2 is not thought to be
part of the canonical central auditory pathway but is connected to many other cortical regions
including AC (Nelson and Mooney, 2016; Schneider et al., 2018; Schneider et al., 2014). This
region has recently been shown to be involved in orienting responses, categorization of perceptual
stimuli, and in suppressing AC responses during movement (Erlich et al., 2011; Hanks et al., 2015;
Schneider et al., 2014). These characteristics suggest that FR2 may be important for goal-oriented
behavior.
We first asked if activity in AC or FR2 is required for animals to successfully perform this audiomo-
tor task. We implanted cannulas into AC or FR2 (Figure 1—figure supplement 2), and infused the
GABA agonist muscimol bilaterally into AC or FR2, to inactivate either region prior to testing behav-
ioral performance. We found that task performance was impaired if either of these regions was inac-
tivated, although general motor functions, including motivation or ability to feed were not impaired
(Figure 1—figure supplement 3; for AC p=0.03; for FR2 p=0.009 Student’s paired two-tailed
t-test). Thus activity in both AC and FR2 may be important, perhaps in different ways, for successful
performance on this task. We note that a previously published study (Gimenez et al., 2015)
observed a more modest effect of muscimol-based inactivation of auditory cortex (although we used
a separate task and higher dose of muscimol than that study which might contribute to this
difference).
Once animals reached behavioral criteria (hit rates � 70% and d’ values � 1.5), they were
implanted with tetrode arrays in either AC or FR2 (Figure 1—figure supplement 4). After recovery,
we made single-unit recordings from individual neurons or small ensembles of two to eight cells dur-
ing task performance. The trial-averaged responses of some cells exhibited obvious task-related fea-
tures: neuronal activity was tone-modulated compared to inter-trial baseline activity (Figure 1C) or
gradually changed over the course of the trial as measured by a ramping index (Figure 1D; hereafter
referred to as ‘ramping activity’). However, 60% of recorded cells were non-classically responsive in
that they were neither tone modulated nor ramping according to statistical criteria (Figure 1E and
F; Figure 1—figure supplement 5; 64/103 AC cells and 43/74 FR2 cells from 15 animals had neither
significant tone-modulated activity or ramping activity; pre and post-stimulus mean activity com-
pared via subsampled bootstrapping and considered significant when p<0.05; ramping activity mea-
sured with linear regression and considered significant via subsampled bootstrapping when p<0.05
and r > 0.5; for overall population statistics see Figure 1—figure supplement 6). While the fraction
of non-classically responsive AC neurons observed is consistent with previous studies that use differ-
ent auditory stimuli or behavioral paradigms (Jaramillo and Zador, 2011; Rodgers and DeWeese,

 2014), this definition does not preclude the possibility that non-classically responsive cells can be
driven by other acoustic stimuli or behavioral paradigms.
Novel single-trial, ISI-based algorithm for decoding non-classically
responsive activity
Given that the majority of our recordings were from non-classically responsive cells, we developed a
general method for interpreting neural responses even when trial-averaged responses were not
obviously task-modulated which allowed us to compare coding schemes across different brain
regions (here, AC and FR2). The algorithm is agnostic to the putative function of neurons as well as
the task variable of interest (here, stimulus category or behavioral choice).
Our algorithm empirically estimates the interspike interval (ISI) distribution of individual neurons
to decode the stimulus category (target or non-target) or behavioral choice (go or no-go) on each
trial via Bayesian inference. The ISI was chosen because its distribution could vary between task con-
ditions even without changes in the firing rate – building on previous work demonstrating that the
ISI distribution contains complementary information to the firing rate (Lundstrom and Fairhall,
2006; Reich et al., 2000; Zuo et al., 2015). The distinction between the ISI distribution and trial-
averaged firing rate is subtle, yet important. While the ISI is obviously closely related to the instanta-
neous firing rate, decoding with the ISI distribution is not simply a proxy for using the time-varying,
trial-averaged rate. To demonstrate this, we constructed three model cells: a stimulus-evoked cell
with distinct target and non-target ISI distributions (Figure 2A), a stimulus-evoked cell with identical
ISI distributions (Figure 2B), and a non-classically responsive cell with distinct target and non-target
ISI distributions (Figure 2C). These models clearly demonstrate that trial-averaged rate modulation
can occur with or without corresponding differences in the ISI distributions and cells without appar-
ent trial-averaged rate-modulation can nevertheless have distinct ISI distributions. Taken together,
these examples demonstrate that the ISI distribution and trial-averaged firing rate capture different
spike train statistics. This has important implications for decoding non-classically responsive cells
that by definition do not exhibit large firing rate modulations but nevertheless may contain informa-
tion latent in their ISI distributions.
For each recorded neuron, we built a library of ISIs observed during target trials and a library for
non-target trials from a set of ‘training trials’. Two different cells from AC are shown in Figure 3A
and Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–D, and another cell from FR2 is shown in Figure 3—figure
supplement 1E–H. These libraries were used to infer the probability of observing an ISI during a
particular trial type (Figure 3B,C; Figure 3—figure supplement 1C,G; left panels show target in red
and non-target in blue). These conditional probabilities were inferred using non-parametric statistical
methods to minimize assumptions about the underlying process generating the ISI distribution and
better capture the heterogeneity of the observed ISI distributions (Figure 3B; Figure 3—figure sup-
plement 1C,G). We verified that our observed distributions were better modeled by non-parametric

 methods rather than standard parametric methods (e.g. rate-modulated Poisson process; Figure 3—
figure supplement 2). Specifically, we found the distributions using Kernel Density Estimation where
the kernel bandwidth for each distribution was set using 10-fold cross-validation. To accommodate
any non-stationarity, these ISI distributions were calculated in 1 s long sliding windows recalculated
every 100 ms over the course of the trial. We then used these training set probability functions to
decode a spike train from a previously unexamined individual trial from the set of remaining ‘test

target)); on left) and behavioral choice (p(ISI)*(log p2(ISI|go) - log2(ISI|no-go)); on right). When curve is above zero the ISI suggests target (go) and when
below zero the ISI suggests non-target (no-go). (D) Probability functions from B were used as the likelihood function to estimate the prediction of a
spike train on an individual trial (bottom). Bayes’ rule was used to update the probability of a stimulus (top) or choice (bottom) as the trial progressed
and more ISIs were observed. The prediction for the trial was assessed at the end of the trial as the probability of stimulus category (or choice). In this
example trial, p(target|ISI)=61%.

 trials’. This process was repeated 124 times using 10-fold cross-validation with randomly generated
folds.
Importantly, while the probabilities of observing particular ISIs on target and non-target trials
were similar (Figure 3B; Figure 3—figure supplement 1C,G), small differences between the curves
carried sufficient information to allow for decoding. To characterize these differences, we used the
weighted log likelihood ratio (W. LLR; Figure 3C; Figure 3—figure supplement 1C,G) to clearly rep-
resent which ISIs suggested target (W. LLR > 0) or non-target (W. LLR < 0) stimulus categories. Our
algorithm relies only on statistical differences between task conditions; therefore, the W. LLR sum-
marizes all spike timing information necessary for decoding. Similar ISI libraries were also computed
for behavioral choice categories (Figure 3B,C; Figure 3—figure supplement 1C; right panels show
go decision in green and no-go in purple). These examples clearly illustrate that the relationship
between the ISIs and task variables cannot simply be approximated by an ISI or firing rate threshold
where short ISIs imply one task variable and longer ISIs imply another: in the cell shown in Figure 3,
short ISIs (ISI < 50 ms) indicated non-target, medium ISIs (50 ms <ISI < 100 ms) indicated target, and
longer ISIs indicated non-target (100 ms <ISI).
The algorithm uses the statistical prevalence of certain ISI values under particular task conditions
(in this case the ISIs accompanying stimulus category or behavioral choice), to infer the task condi-
tion for each trial. Each trial begins with equally uncertain probabilities about the stimulus categories
(i.e. p(target)=p(non-target)=50%). As each ISI is observed sequentially within the trial, the algorithm
applies Bayes’ rule to update p(target|ISI) and p(non-target|ISI) using the likelihood of the ISI under
each stimulus category (p(ISI|target) and p(ISI|non-target) (Figure 3B–D). As these functions were
estimated in 1 s long sliding windows, each ISI was assessed using the distribution that placed the
final spike closest to the center of the sliding window. As shown for one trial of the example cell in
Figure 3D, ISIs observed between 0 and 1.0 s consistently suggested the presence of the target
tone, whereas ISIs observed between 1.0 and 1.4 s suggested the non-target category thereby also
necessarily reducing the belief that a target tone was played (Figure 3D, top trace). These ISI likeli-
hood functions consider each ISI to be independent of previous ISIs and therefore ignore correla-
tions between ISIs. After this process was completed for all ISIs in the particular trial, we obtained
the probability of a non-target tone and a target tone as a function of time during the trial
(Figure 3D). Because it is particularly challenging to dissociate choice from motor execution or pre-
paratory motor activity in this task paradigm, the prediction for the entire trial p(target|ISI) is evalu-
ated at the end of the trial (in the example trial, p(target|ISI)=61%; Figure 3D). This process is
repeated for the behavioral choice (Figure 3B–D; right panels; trials separated according to go, no-
go; probabilities of ISIs in each condition generated; conditional probabilities used as likelihood
function to predict behavioral choice on a given trial). The single-trial decoding performance of each
neuron is then averaged over all trials as a measure of the overall ability of each neuron to distin-
guish behavioral conditions (Figure 4A). Note that this measure not only takes into account whether
the algorithm was correct on individual trials (i.e. target vs. non-target), but also its prediction
certainty.
Non-classically responsive cells contain spike-timing-based task
information
Can we uncover task information from non-classically responsive cells? We found that non-classically
responsive cells in both AC and FR2 provided significant spike-timing-based information about each
task variable (Figure 4A,B, red; Figure 4—figure supplement 1). The ability to decode was poorly
explained by the average firing rate (Figure 4—figure supplements 2A–F and 0.30 < r < 0.46),
z-score (Figure 4—figure supplements 2G–I, –0.05 < r < 0.05), and ramping activity (Figure 4—fig-
ure supplements 2J, –0.02 < r < 0.28). Stimulus decoding performance was also independent of
receptive field properties including best frequency and tuning curve bandwidth for AC neurons (Fig-
ure 4—figure supplement 3).
We also observed that task information was distributed across both AC and FR2, and neural spike
trains from individual units were multiplexed in that they often encoded information about both
stimulus category and choice simultaneously (Figure 4B, Table 1). Given the strong correlation
between stimulus and choice variables in the task design, it is difficult to fully separate information
about one variable from information about the other. To establish that multiplexing was not simply a
byproduct of this correlation, an independent measure of multiplexing relying on multiple regression

 was applied (Figure 4—figure supplement 4). This analysis confirmed that the information revealed
by our algorithm about a behavioral variable was primarily a reflection of that variable and not simply
an indirect measure of the other, correlated variable. This analysis establishes that a certain degree
of separability is possible and demonstrates that the multiplexing observed in our decoding results
is unlikely to be a trivial byproduct of correlations in the task variables.
Despite the broad sharing of information about behavioral conditions, there were notable system-
atic differences between AC and FR2. Surprisingly, neurons in FR2 were more informative about
stimulus category than AC, and AC neurons were more informative about choice than stimulus cate-
gory (Figure 4A, pAC = 0.016, pstim = 0.0013, Mann-Whitney U test, two-sided). Both of these obser-
vations would not have been detected at the level of the PSTH, as most cells in AC were non-
classically responsive for behavioral choice (no ramping activity, 91/103), yet our decoder revealed
that these same cells were as informative as choice classically responsive cells (Figure 4C, p=0.32
Mann-Whitney U test, two-sided; red circles indicate cells non-classically responsive for both varia-
bles, dark-red cells are choice non-classically responsive, and black cells are classically responsive).
Similarly, most cells in FR2 were sensory non-classically responsive (not tone modulated, 60/74), yet
contained comparable stimulus information to sensory classically responsive cells (Figure 4D,
p=0.29 Mann-Whitney U test, two-sided; red cells are non-classically responsive for both variables,
dark-red cells are sensory non-classically responsive, black cells are classically responsive).
To assess the statistical significance of these results, we tested our algorithm on two shuffled
data sets. First, we ran our analysis using synthetically-generated trials that preserved trial length but
randomly sampled ISIs with replacement from those observed during a session without regard to
condition (Figure 4E). Second, we left trial activity intact but permuted the stimulus category and
choice for each trial (Figure 4F). We restricted analysis to cells with decoding performance signifi-
cantly different from synthetic spike trains (all cells in Figure 4A–D significantly different from syn-
thetic condition shown in Figure 4E, p<0.05, bootstrapped 1240 times).
To directly assess the extent to which information captured by the ISI distributions in our data set
was distinct from the time-varying rate, we compared the performance from our ISI-based decoder
to a conventional rate-modulated (inhomogeneous) Poisson decoder (Rieke et al., 1999), which
assumes that spikes are produced randomly with an instantaneous probability equal to the time-
varying firing rate. As our model cells illustrate (Figure 2), it is possible to decode using the ISI distri-
butions even when firing rates are uninformative (Figure 5A). When applied to our dataset, the ISI-
based decoder generally outperformed this conventional rate-based decoder confirming that ISIs
capture information distinct from that of the firing rate (Figure 5B; Overall stimulus decoding perfor-
mance: pAC = 0.0001, pFR2 = 8 � 10�6; Overall choice decoding performance pAC = 0.0057,
pFR2 = 0.02, Mann-Whitney U test, two-sided). Moreover, comparing single trial decoding outcomes
demonstrated weak to no correlations between the ISI-based decoder and the conventional rate

 decoder, further underscoring that these two methods rely on different features of the spike train to
decode (Figure 5C; stimulus medians: AC = 0.10 FR2 = 0.11; choice medians: AC = 0.07,
FR2 = 0.08).
We hypothesize that ISI-based decoding is biologically plausible. Short-term synaptic plasticity
and synaptic integration provide powerful mechanisms for differential and specific spike-timing-
based coding. We illustrated this capacity by making whole-cell recordings from AC neurons in vivo
and in brain slices (Figure 5—figure supplement 1A,B), as well as in FR2 brain slices (Figure 5—fig-
ure supplement 1C). In each case, different cells could have distinct response profiles to the same
input pattern, with similar overall rates but different spike timings.
Moreover, we note that this type of coding scheme requires few assumptions about implementa-
tion, and does not require additional separate integrative processes to compute rates or form gener-
ative models. Thus, ISI-based decoding coding could be generally applicable across brain areas, as
demonstrated here for AC and FR2.
Non-classically responsive cells encode selection rule information in a
novel task-switching paradigm
To further demonstrate the generalizability and utility of our approach, we applied our decoding
algorithm to neurons that were found to be non-classically responsive in a previously published study
(Rodgers and DeWeese, 2014). In this study, rats were trained on a novel auditory stimulus selec-
tion task where depending on the context animals had to respond to one of two cues while ignoring
the other. Rats were presented with two simultaneous sounds (a white noise burst and a warble). In
the ‘localization’ context, the animal was trained to ignore the warble and respond to the location of
the white noise burst and in the ‘pitch’ context it was trained to ignore the location of the white
noise burst and respond to the pitch of the warble (Figure 6A). Using our algorithm, we found sig-
nificant stimulus and choice-related information in the activity of non-classically responsive cells that
displayed no stimulus modulation nor ramping activity in the firing rate (Figure 6B–D). The main
finding of the study is that the pre-stimulus activity in both primary auditory cortex and prefrontal
cortex encodes the selection rule (i.e. activity reflects whether the animal is in the localization or
pitch context). This conclusion was entirely based on a difference in pre-stimulus firing rate between
the two contexts. The authors reported, but did not further analyze, cells that did not modulate their
pre-stimulus firing rate. In our nomenclature these cells are ‘non-classically responsive for the selec-
tion rule’. Using our algorithm, we found that the ISI distributions of these cells encoded the selec-
tion rule and were significantly more informative than the classically responsive cells (Figure 6E,
pAC = 5 � 10�6, pPFC <0.0002, Mann-Whitney U test, two-sided). This surprising result demonstrates
that our algorithm generalizes to novel datasets, and may be used to uncover coding for cognitive

that the relationship between the decoders is close to chance. Typically, values from �0.5 to 0.5 are considered evidence for weak to no correlation
(stimulus median and interquartile range: AC = 0.10, 0.09, FR2 = 0.11, 0.12; choice median and interquartile range: AC = 0.06, 0.15, FR2 = 0.08, 0.17).

 variables beyond those apparent from conventional trial-averaged, rate-based analyses. Further-
more, these results indicate that as task complexity increases non-classically responsive cells are dif-
ferentially recruited for successful task execution.
Non-classically responsive ensembles are better predictors of
behavioral errors
Downstream brain regions must integrate the activity of many neurons and this ISI-based approach
naturally extends to simultaneously recorded ensembles. We therefore asked whether using small

 ensembles would change or improve decoding. To decode from ensembles, likelihood functions
from each cell were calculated independently as before but were used to simultaneously update the
task condition probabilities (p(target | ISI) and p(go | ISI)) on each trial (Figure 7A). Analyzing ensem-
bles of two to eight neurons in AC and FR2 significantly improved decoding for both variables in
FR2 and stimulus decoding in AC (Figure 7B, pAC stim=0.04, pFR2 stim=1�10�5, pAC = 0.29, pFR2 choic-
e=7�10�5, Mann-Whitney U test, two-sided). This was not a trivial consequence of using more neu-
rons, as the information provided by individual ISIs on single trials can be contradictory (e.g.
compare LLR functions in Figure 3C and Figure 3—figure supplement 1C for 50 ms <ISIs < 120
ms). For ensemble decoding to improve upon single neuron decoding, the ISIs of each member of
the ensemble must indicate the same task variable.
Can our decoding method predict errors on a trial-by-trial basis? In general, trial-averaged PSTHs
did not reveal systematic differences between correct and error trials (Figure 7—figure supplement
1). However, when we examined single-trial performance with our algorithm, ensembles of neurons
in AC and FR2 predicted behavioral errors (Figure 7C). In general, ensembles in AC predicted
behavioral errors significantly better than those in FR2 (Figure 7C, for three-member ensembles:
p=1.2 � 10�5, for four-member ensembles: p=0.03, Mann-Whitney U test, two-sided). Interestingly,
decoding with an increasing number of non-classically responsive cells improved error prediction in
both AC and FR2 (Figure 7D, (pAC = 0.013, pFR2 = 0.046, Welch’s t-test).
Timing-dependent ensemble consensus-building dynamics underlie task
information
While improvements were seen in decoding performance with increasing ensemble size, the ISI dis-
tributions/ISI-based likelihood functions were highly variable across individual ensemble members.
Thus, we wondered if there was task-related structure in the timing of population activity that
evolved over the course of the trial to instantiate behavior. To answer this question, we examined
whether local ensembles share the same representation of task variables over the course of the trial.
Do they ‘reach consensus’ on how to represent task variables using the ISI (Figure 8A)? Without con-
sensus, a downstream area would need to interpret ensemble activity using multiple disparate repre-
sentations rather than one unified code (Figure 8B). The firing rates and ISI distributions of
simultaneously-recorded units were generally variable across cells requiring an exploratory approach
to answer this question (Figure 8C, example three-member ensemble with heterogeneous condi-
tional ISI distributions). Therefore, we examined changes in the distributions of ISIs across task condi-
tions, asking how the moment-to-moment changes in the log-likelihood ratio (LLR) of each cell were
coordinated to encode task variables (Figure 8C). We focused on the LLR because it quantifies how
the ISI represents task variables for a given cell and summarizes all spike timing information needed
by our algorithm (or a hypothetical downstream cell) to decode.
We examined how ensembles coordinate their activity moment-to-moment over the course of the
trial by quantifying the similarity of the LLRs across cells in a sliding window. Similarity was assessed
by summing the LLRs of ensemble members, calculating the total area underneath the resulting
curve, and normalizing this value by the sum of the areas of each individual LLR. We refer to this
quantified similarity as ‘consensus’; a high consensus value indicates that ensemble members have
similar LLRs and therefore have a similar representation of task variables (Figure 8D). We should
emphasize that successful ensemble decoding (Figure 7) does not require the LLRs of ensemble
members to be related in any way; therefore, structured LLR dynamics (Figure 8) are not simply a
consequence of how our algorithm is constructed.
While the conventional trial-averaged PSTH of non-classically responsive ensembles recorded in
AC and FR2 showed no task-related modulation, our analysis revealed structured temporal dynamics
of the LLRs (captured by the consensus value). On correct trials, we observe a trajectory of increasing
consensus at specific moments during the trial signifying a dynamically created, shared ISI represen-
tation of task variables. In FR2, sensory non-classically responsive ensembles (ensembles in which at
least two out of three cells were not tone-modulated) encode stimulus information using temporally-
precise stimulus-related dynamics on correct trials. The stimulus representation of sensory non-classi-
cally responsive ensembles reached consensus rapidly after stimulus onset followed by divergence
(Figure 8E, stimulus-aligned, solid line, Dconsensus, t = 0 to 0.42 s, pSNR = 3.9 � 10�4 Wilcoxon test
with Bonferroni correction, two-sided). Sensory classically responsive ensembles in AC increased
consensus beyond stimulus presentation, reaching a maximum ~750 ms after tone onset on correct

 trials (Figure 8E stimulus-aligned, dotted line, Dconsensus, t = 0 to 0.81 s, pSR = 0.14 Wilcoxon test
with Bonferroni correction, two-sided). For choice-related activity, choice non-classically responsive
ensembles in both regions as well as choice classically responsive ensembles in FR2 each reached
consensus within 500 ms of the behavioral response (Figure 8E, response-aligned, Dconsensus,
t = �1.0 to 0.0 s, pCNR = 2.0 � 10�5, pCR = 0.12 Wilcoxon test with Bonferroni correction, two-
sided). Importantly, this temporally precise pattern of consensus building is not present on error tri-
als. On error trials, stimulus consensus dynamics decreased over the course of the trial whereas
choice dynamics did not display a systematic increase with the exception of choice non-classically
responsive ensembles in AC which remained systematically lower than correct trials (Figure 8F,
Dconsensus, correct trials vs. error trials, stimulus: pSNR = 0.007, pSR = 0.065, choice: pCNR = 0.0048,

pSNR = 1.3 � 10�33, t = �1.0 to 0 s, pCNR = 0.032, pCR = 0.14 Wilcoxon test with Bonferroni correc-
tion, two-sided). The observed increases in ensemble consensus on correct trials (while failing do so
on error trials) suggests that achieving a shared ISI representation of task variables may be relevant
for successful task execution.
These results reveal that consensus-building and divergence occur at key moments during the
trial for successful execution of behavior in a manner that is invisible at the level of the PSTH. As sen-
sory and choice non-classically responsive ensembles participated in these dynamics, changes in the
consensus value cannot simply be a byproduct of correlated firing rate modulation due to tone-
evoked responses or ramping. While consensus-building can only indicate a shared representation,
divergence can indicate one of two things: (1) the LLRs of each cell within an ensemble are
completely dissimilar or (2) they are ‘out of phase’ with one another – the LLRs partition the ISIs the
same way (Figure 8D, dotted lines), but the same ISIs code for opposite behavioral variables. This
distinction is important because (2) implies coordinated structure of ensemble activity (the partitions
of the ISI align) whereas (1) does not. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we used the
‘unsigned consensus’, a second measure sensitive to the ISI partitions but insensitive to the sign of
the LLR. Both ‘in phase’ and perfectly ‘out of phase’ LLRs would produce an unsigned consensus of
1, whereas unrelated LLRs would be closer to 0 (Figure 8D). For example, in the second row of
Figure 8D, both cells agree that ISIs < 100 ms indicate one stimulus category and ISIs > 100 ms indi-
cate another, but they disagree about which set of ISIs mean target and which mean non-target.
This results in a consensus value of 0 (out of phase) but an unsigned consensus value of 1.
Using this metric, we found that the unsigned consensus pattern for non-classically responsive
ensembles (ensembles with two or more non-classically responsive members) were shared between
AC and FR2 – increasing until ~750 ms after tone onset on correct trials (Figure 8G, stimulus-
aligned, D consensus, t = 0 to 0.89 s, p=1.7 � 10�5 Wilcoxon test, two-sided). Non-classically
responsive ensembles in AC and FR2 also increased their unsigned consensus immediately before
behavioral response (although values in AC were lower overall; Figure 8G, response-aligned,
Dconsensus, t = �1.0 to 0.0 s, p=0.0011 Wilcoxon test, two-sided). This pattern of consensus-build-
ing was only present on correct trials. On error trials unsigned consensus values did not systemati-
cally increase (Figure 8H, Dconsensus compared to error trials, p=1.9 � 10�9 Mann-Whitney U test,
two-sided) suggesting that behavioral errors might result from a general lack of consensus between
ensemble members. In summary, we have shown that cells which appear unmodulated during behav-
ior do not encode task information independently, but do so by synchronizing their representation
of behavioral variables dynamically during the trial.
Discussion
Using a straightforward, single-trial, ISI decoding algorithm that makes few assumptions about the
proper model for neural activity, we found task-specific information extensively represented by non-
classically responsive neurons in both AC and FR2 that lacked conventional task-related, trial-

 averaged firing rate modulation. The complexity of single-trial spiking patterns and the apparent var-
iability between trials led to the development of this novel decoding method. Furthermore, the het-
erogeneity in the observed ISI distributions
within and across brain
regions precluded a
straightforward interpretation of these distributions and instead suggested an approach which
focused on whether and when these distributions are shared in local ensembles via consensus-
building.
The degree to which single neurons were task-modulated was uncorrelated with conventional
response properties including frequency tuning. AC and FR2 each represent both task-variables; fur-
thermore, in both regions, we identified many multiplexed neurons that simultaneously represented
the sensory input and the upcoming behavioral choice including non-classically responsive cells. This
highlights that the cortical circuits that generate behavior exist in a distributed network – blurring
the traditional modular view of sensory and frontal cortical regions.
Most notably, FR2 has a better representation of task-relevant auditory stimuli than AC. The prev-
alence of stimulus information in FR2 might be surprising given that AC reliably responds to pure
tones in untrained animals; however, when tones take on behavioral significance, this information is
encoded more robustly in frontal cortex, suggesting that this region is critical for identifying the
appropriate sensory-motor association. Furthermore, the stark improvement in stimulus encoding
for small ensembles in FR2 suggests that task-relevant stimulus information is reflected more homo-
geneously in local firing activity across FR2 (perhaps through large-scale ensemble consensus-build-
ing) while this information is reflected in a more complex and distributed manner throughout AC.
We have identified task-informative non-classically responsive neurons recorded while animals
performed a frequency recognition task or a task-switching paradigm. This does not preclude the
possibility that these cells are driven by other acoustic stimuli or in other behavioral contexts; how-
ever, determining the significance of non-classically responsive activity must ultimately be considered
in the specific behavioral context in question, as their role may be dynamic and context dependent.
The finding that the ISI-based approach of our algorithm is not reducible to rate despite their
close mathematical relationship raises the question of how downstream regions could respond pref-
erentially to specific ISIs. Our whole-cell recordings from both AC and FR2 demonstrate that differ-
ent postsynaptic cells can respond differently to the same input pattern with a fixed overall rate,
emphasizing the importance of considering a code sensitive to precise spike-timing perhaps via

agreeing on the meaning of all ISIs (consensus = 1) and on how the ISIs should be partitioned (unsigned consensus = 1). Ensemble 2 contains cells with
LLRs where the ISI meanings are reversed, disagreeing on meaning of the ISIs (consensus = 0) but still agree on how the ISIs should be partitioned
(unsigned consensus = 1). Ensemble 3 contains two cells with moderate agreement about the ISI meanings and partitioning, leading to intermediate
consensus and unsigned consensus values (0.5 for each). (E) Left, mean consensus as a function of time from tone onset (stimulus-aligned) on correct

 mechanisms of differential short-term plasticity such as depression and facilitation (Figure 5—figure
supplement 1). Furthermore, this is supported by experimental and theoretical work showing that
single neurons can act as resonators tuned to a certain periodicity of firing input (Izhikevich, 2000).
This view could also be expanded to larger neuronal populations comprised of feedback loops that
would resonate in response to particular ISIs. In this case, cholinergic neuromodulation could offer a
mechanism for adjusting the sensitivities of such a network during behavior on short time-scales by
providing rapid phasic signals (Hangya et al., 2015).
Our consensus results reveal dynamic changes in the relationship between the LLRs of ensemble
members. How might such a downstream resonator interpret a given ISI in the context of these
dynamics? Our consensus analysis provides one possible answer: downstream neurons may be
attuned to the ISIs specified by the consensus LLR of an ensemble. In such a model, an ensemble
would have the strongest influence on downstream activity when they reach high consensus. We
additionally hypothesize that mechanisms of long-term synaptic plasticity such as spike-timing-
dependent plasticity can redistribute synaptic efficacy, essentially changing the dynamics of short-
term plasticity independent from overall changes in amplitudes (Markram and Tsodyks, 1996).
Thus, after training, downstream neurons do not need to continually change the readout mechanism-
rather, the upstream and downstream components might be modified together by cortical plasticity
during initial phases of behavioral training. This would set the ISI distributions appropriate for firing
of task-relevant downstream neurons, which would ensure that ensemble consensus is reached for
correct sensory processing in highly trained animals.
It is still unclear what the relevant timescales of decoding might be in relation to phenomena such
as membrane time constants, periods of oscillatory activity, and behavioral timescales. Given that
our ISI-based decoder and conventional rate-modulated decoders reveal distinct information, future
approaches might hybridize these rate-based and temporal-based decoding methods to span multi-
ple timescales. Other recent studies have also contributed to our understanding of non-classically
responsive activity, by evaluating firing rates or responses from calcium imaging to demonstrate
how correlations with classically responsive activity may contribute to the linear separability of
ensemble responses (Leavitt et al., 2017; Zylberberg, 2018).
We have shown that underlying the task-relevant information encoded by each ensemble is a rich
set of consensus-building dynamics that is invisible at the level of the PSTH. Ensembles in both FR2
and AC underwent stimulus and choice-related consensus building that was only observed when the
animal correctly executed the task. Moreover, non-classically responsive cells demonstrated tempo-
ral dynamics synchronized across regions which were distinct from classically responsive ensembles.
These results underscore the importance of measuring neural activity in behaving animals and using
unbiased and generally applicable analytical methods, as the response properties of cortical neurons
in a behavioral context become complex in ways that challenge our conventional assumptions
(Carcea et al., 2017; Fritz et al., 2010; Kuchibhotla et al., 2017; Otazu et al., 2009).

 Behavior
All animal procedures were performed in accordance with National Institutes of Health standards
and were conducted under a protocol approved by the New York University School of Medicine
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. We used 23 adult Sprague-Dawley male and female
rats (Charles River) in the behavioral studies. Animals were food restricted and kept at 85% of their
initial body weight, and maintained at a 12 hr light/12 hr dark cycle.
Animals were trained on a go/no-go audiomotor task (Carcea et al., 2017; Froemke et al.,
2013). Operant conditioning was performed within 12’ L x 10’ W x 10.5’ H test chambers with stain-
less steel floors and clear polycarbonate walls (Med Associates), enclosed in a sound attenuation
cubicle and lined with soundproofing acoustic foam (Med Associates). The nose and reward ports
were both arranged on one of the walls with the speaker on the opposite wall. The nose port,
reward port, and the speaker were controlled and monitored with a custom-programmed microcon-
troller. Nose port entries were detected with an infrared beam break detector. Auditory stimuli were
delivered through an electromagnetic dynamic speaker (Med Associates) calibrated using a pressure
field microphone (ACO Pacific).
Animals were rewarded with food for nose poking within 2.5 s of presentation of the target tone
(4 kHz) and given a short 7 s time-out for incorrectly responding to non-target tones (0.5, 1, 2, 8, 16,
32 kHz). Incorrect responses include either failure to enter the nose port after target tone presenta-
tion (miss trials) or entering the nose port after non-target tone presentation (false alarms). Tones
were 100 ms in duration and sound intensity was set to 70 dB SPL. Tones were presented randomly
with equal probability such that each stimulus category was presented. The inter-trial interval delays
used were 5, 6, 7, or 8 s.
For experiments involving muscimol, we implanted bilateral cannulas in either FR2 (+2.0 to +4.0
mm AP, ±1.3 mm ML from Bregma) of seven animals or AC (-5.0 to -5.8 mm AP, 6.5-7.0 mm ML
from Bregma) of three animals. We infused 1 mL of muscimol per side into FR2 or infused 2 mL of
muscimol per side into AC, at a concentration of 1 mg/mL. For saline controls, equivalent volumes
of saline were infused in each region. Behavioral testing was performed 30-60 min after infusions.
Power analysis was performed to determine sample size for statistical significance with a power of b:
0.8; these studies required at least three animals, satisfied in the experiments of Figure 1-figure sup-
plement 3B,E. For motor control study, animals could freely nose poke for food reward without pre-
sentation of auditory stimuli after muscimol and saline infusion.
Implant preparation and surgery
Animals were implanted with microdrive arrays (Versadrive-8 Neuralynx) in either AC (eight animals)
or FR2 (seven animals) after reaching behavioral criteria of d’�1.0. For surgery, animals were anes-
thetized with ketamine (40 mg/kg) and dexmedetomidine (0.125 mg/kg). Stainless steel screws and
dental cement were used to secure the microdrive to the skull, and one screw was used as ground.
Each drive consisted of eight independently adjustable tetrodes. The tetrodes were made by twist-
ing and fusing four polyimide-coated nichrome wires (Sandvik Kanthal HP Reid Precision Fine Tet-
rode Wire; wire diameter 12.5 mm). The tip of each tetrode was gold-plated to an impedance of
300–400 kOhms at 1 kHz (NanoZ, Neuralynx).
Electrophysiological recordings and unit isolation
Recordings in behaving rats were performed as previously described (Carcea et al., 2017). After the
animal recovered from surgery (~7 days) recordings began once performance returned to pre-sur-
gery levels. Tetrodes were advanced ~60 mm 12 hr prior to each recording session, to a maximum of
2.5 mm (for FR2) or 2.0 mm (for AC) from the pial surface. For recording, signals were first amplified
onboard using a small 16-bit unity-gain preamplifier array (CerePlex M, Blackrock Microsystems)
before reaching the acquisition system. Spikes were sampled at 30 kS/sec and bandpass filtered
between 250 Hz and 5 kHz. Data were digitized and all above-threshold events with signal-to-noise
ratios > 3:1 were stored for offline spike sorting. Single-units were identified on each tetrode using
OfflineSorter (Plexon Inc) by manually classifying spikes projected as points in 2D or 3D feature
space. The parameters used for sorting included the waveforms projection onto the first two princi-
pal components, energy, and nonlinear energy. Artifacts were rejected based on refractory period
violations (<1 msec). Clustering quality was assessed based on the Isolation Distance and Lratio

 sorting quality metrics. To be initially included for analysis, cells had to have >3 spikes per trial for
80% of trials to ensure that there were enough ISIs to reliably estimate the ISI probability density
functions.
Statistical tests for non-classical responsiveness
We used two positive statistical tests for non-classical responsiveness: one to establish a lack of
tone-modulation, the other to establish a lack of ramping activity. To accommodate the possibility
of tone onset and offset responses, we performed our tone-modulation test on a 100 ms long tone
presentation window as well as the 100 ms window immediately after tone presentation. The test
compared the number of spikes during each of these windows to inter-trial baseline activity as mea-
sured by three sequential 100 ms windows preceding tone onset. Three windows were chosen to
account for variability in spontaneous spike counts. Given that spike counts are discrete, bounded,
and non-normal, we used subsampled bootstrapping to evaluate whether the mean change in spikes
during tone presentation was sufficiently close to zero (in our case 0.1 spikes). We subsampled 90%
of the spike count changes from baseline, calculated the mean of these values, and repeated this
process 5000 times to construct a distribution of means. If 95% of the subsampled means values
were between �0.1 and 0.1, we considered the cell sensory non-classically responsive (p<0.05). The
range of mean values from �0.1 to 0.1 were included to account for both tone-evoked (increases in
spike count) and tone-suppressed (decreases in spike count) activity. The value of 0.1 spikes was
chosen to be conservative as it is equivalent to an expected change of 1 spike every 10 trials. This is
a conservative, rigorous method for establishing sensory non-classical responsiveness that is com-
mensurate with more standard approaches for establishing tone responsiveness such as the z-score.
To quantify the observed sustained increase or decrease in firing rate preceding the behavioral
response, a ramp index was calculated adapted from the ‘build-up rate’ used in previous literature31.
First, the trial averaged firing rate was determined in 50 ms bins leading up to the behavioral
response. We then calculated the slope of a linear regression in a 500 ms long sliding window begin-
ning 850 ms before behavioral response. The maximum value of these slopes was used as the ‘ramp
index’ for each cell. Cells were classified as choice non-classically responsive if the ramp index did
not indicate an appreciable change in the firing rate (less than 50% change) established via sub-
sampled bootstrapping. Cells that were shown to be both sensory and choice non-classically respon-
sive were considered non-classically responsive overall (Figure 4A,B, red circles).
Additional firing statistics
Spontaneous average firing rate was established by averaging spikes in a 100 ms time window
immediately prior to tone onset on each trial. To quantify tone modulated responses observed dur-
ing stimulus presentation, we calculated z-scores of changes in spike count from 100 ms before tone
onset to 100 ms during tone presentation:
z ¼ �
s
where � is the mean change in spike count and s is the standard deviation of the change in spike
count.
Analysis of receptive field properties
Receptive fields were constructed by calculating the average change in firing rate from 50 ms before
tone onset to 50 ms during tone presentation. The window used during tone presentation was iden-
tical to that used to calculate the z-score. Best frequency was defined as the frequency where the
largest positive deviation in the evoked firing rate was observed. Tuning curve bandwidth was deter-
mined by calculating the width of the tuning curve measured at the mean of the maximum and mini-
mum observed evoked firing rates.
In vivo whole-cell recordings
Sprague-Dawley rats 3–5 months old were anesthetized with pentobarbital. Experiments were car-
ried out in a sound-attenuating chamber. Series of pure tones (70 dB SPL, 0.5–32 kHz, 50 ms, 3 ms
cosine on/off ramps, inter-tone intervals between 50 and 500 ms) were delivered in pseudo-random

 sequence. Primary AC location was determined by mapping multiunit responses 500–700 mm below
the surface using tungsten electrodes. In vivo whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings were then
obtained from neurons located 400–1100 mm below the pial surface. Recordings were made with an
AxoClamp 2B (Molecular Devices). Whole-cell pipettes (5–9 MW) contained (in mM): 125 Cs-gluco-
nate, 5 TEACl, 4 MgATP, 0.3 GTP, 10 phosphocreatine, 10 HEPES, 0.5 EGTA, 3.5 QX-314, 2 CsCl,
pH 7.2. Data were filtered at 2 kHz, digitized at 10 kHz, and analyzed with Clampfit 10 (Molecular
Devices). Tone-evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents were recorded at –70 mV.
In vitro whole-cell recordings
Acute brain slices of AC or FR2 were prepared from 2 to 5 month old Sprague-Dawley rats. Animals
were deeply anesthetized with a 1:1 ketamine/xylazine cocktail and decapitated. The brain was rap-
idly placed in ice-cold dissection buffer containing (in mM): 87 NaCl, 75 sucrose, 2.5 KCl, 1.25
NaH2PO4, 0.5 CaCl2, 7 MgCl2, 25 NaHCO3, 1.3 ascorbic acid, and 10 dextrose, bubbled with 95%/
5% O2/CO2 (pH 7.4). Slices (300–400 mm thick) were prepared with a vibratome (Leica), placed in
warm dissection buffer (32–35˚C) for 10 min, then transferred to a holding chamber containing artifi-
cial cerebrospinal fluid at room temperature (ACSF, in mM: 124 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.5 MgSO4, 1.25
NaH2PO4, 2.5 CaCl2, and 26 NaHCO3,). Slices were kept at room temperature (22–24˚C) for at least
30 min before use. For experiments, slices were transferred to the recording chamber and perfused
(2–2.5 ml min�1) with oxygenated ACSF at 33˚C. Somatic whole-cell current-clamp recordings were
made from layer five pyramidal cells with a Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices) using IR-
DIC video microscopy (Olympus). Patch pipettes (3–8 MW) were filled with intracellular solution con-
taining (in mM): 120 K-gluconate, 5 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 5 MgATP, 10 phosphocreatine, and 0.3 GTP.
Data were filtered at 2 kHz, digitized at 10 kHz, and analyzed with Clampfit 10 (Molecular Devices).
Focal extracellular stimulation was applied with a bipolar glass electrode (AMPI Master-9, stimulation
strengths of 0.1–10 V for 0.3 msec). Spike trains recorded from AC and FR2 units during behavior
were then divided into 150–1000 msec fragments, and used as extracellular input patterns for these
recordings.
ISI-based single-trial Bayesian decoding
Our decoding method was motivated by the following general principles: First, single-trial spike tim-
ing is one of the only variables available to downstream neurons. Any observations about trial-aver-
aged activity must ultimately be useful for single-trial decoding, in order to have behavioral
significance. Second, there may not be obvious structure in the trial-averaged activity to suggest
how non-classically responsive cells participate in behaviorally-important computations. This consid-
eration distinguishes our method from other approaches that rely explicitly or implicitly on the PSTH
for interpretation or decoding (Churchland et al., 2008; Erlich et al., 2011; Jaramillo et al., 2014;
Jaramillo and Zador, 2011; Murakami et al., 2014; Wiener and Richmond, 2003). Third, we
required a unified approach capable of decoding from both classically responsive and non-classically
responsive cells in sensory and frontal areas with potentially different response profiles. Fourth, our
model should contain as few parameters as possible to account for all relevant behavioral variables
(stimulus category and behavioral choice). This model-free approach also distinguishes our method
from others that rely on parametric models of neural activity.
These requirements motivated our use of ISIs to characterize neuronal activity. For non-classically
responsive cells with PSTHs that displayed no systematic changes over trials or between task condi-
tions, the ISI distributions can be variable. The ISI defines spike timing relative to the previous spike
and thus does not require reference to an external task variable such as tone onset or behavioral
response. In modeling the distribution of ISIs, we use a non-parametric Kernel Density Estimator that
avoids assumptions about whether or not firing occurs according to a Poisson (or another) parame-
terized distribution. We used 10-fold cross validation to estimate the bandwidth of the Gaussian ker-
nel in a data-driven manner. Finally, the use of the ISI was also motivated by previous work
demonstrating that the ISI can encode sensory information (Lundstrom and Fairhall, 2006;
Reich et al., 2000; Zuo et al., 2015) and that precise spike timing has been shown to be important
for sensory processing in rat auditory cortex (DeWeese et al., 2003; Lu and Wang, 2004). Our
data-driven method combines (1) non-parametric statistical procedures (Kernel Density Estimation),
(2) use of the ISI as the response variable of interest (rather than an estimate of the instantaneous

 firing rate locked to an external task variable), and (3) single-trial decoding via Bayesian inference
rendering it a novel decoder capable of decoding responsive as well as non-classically responsive
activity from any brain region.
Training probabilistic model
Individual trials were defined as the time from stimulus onset to the response time of the animal (or
average response time in the case of no-go trials). Trials were divided into four categories corre-
sponding to each of the four possible variable combinations (target/go, target/no-go, non-target/
go, non-target/no-go). Approximately 90% of each category was set aside as a training set in order
to determine the statistical relationship between the ISI and the two task variables (stimulus cate-
gory, behavioral choice).
Each ISI observed was sorted into libraries according to the stimulus category and behavioral
choice of the trial. The continuous probability distribution of finding a particular ISI given the task
condition of interest (target or non-target, go or no-go) was then inferred using nonparametric Ker-
nel Density Estimation with a Gaussian kernel of bandwidth set using a 10-fold cross-validation
(Jones et al., 1996). Because the domain of the distribution of ISIs is by definition positive (ISI > 0),
the logarithm of the ISI was used to transform the domain to all real numbers. In the end, we pro-
duced four continuous probability distributions quantifying the probability of observing an ISI on a
trial of a given type: p(ISI|target), p(ISI|non-target), p(ISI|go), and p(ISI|no-go). These distributions
were estimated in a 1 s long sliding window (recalculated every 100 ms) starting at the beginning of
the trial and ending at the end of the trial to account for dynamic changes in the ISI distributions
over the course of the trial. These likelihood functions assume that the observed ISIs are indepen-
dent of the previous spiking history of the cell. While this assumption is violated in practice, estima-
tion of the joint probability of an ISI and previous ISIs using non-parametric methods was infeasible
given to the limited number of ISI combinations observed over the session without including addi-
tional assumptions about the correlation structure between ISIs.
Decoding
The remaining 10% of trials in the test set are then decoded using the ISI likelihood function
described in the previous section. Each trial begins with agnostic beliefs about the stimulus category
and the upcoming behavioral choice (p(target)=p(non-target)=50%). Each time an ISI was observed,
beliefs were updated according to Bayes’ rule with the four probability distributions obtained in the
previous section serving as the likelihood function. To update beliefs in the probability of the target
tone when a particular ISI has been observed, we used the following relationship:
p targetjISI; t

Þp target; t

On the left hand side are the updated beliefs about the probability of a target. When the next ISI

As the likelihood functions were estimated in 1 s long sliding windows recalculated every 100 ms,
Each ISI was assessed using the likelihood function that placed the final spike closest to the center of
the sliding window.
Continuing this process over the course of the trial, we obtain four probabilities – one for each of
the variable outcomes – as a function of time during the trial: p(target, t), p(non-target, t), p(go, t),

 and p(no-go, t). At each moment, the total probability of both stimuli and both choices are 1. The
prediction for the entire trial was assessed at the end of the trial, using the overall likelihood func-
tion. Given our independence assumption, the overall likelihood for a spike train is simply equal to
product of the likelihoods for each ISI observed over the course of the trial,

We used 10-fold cross-validation, meaning the trials in the four stimulus categories were ran-
domly divided into ten parts and each part took a turn acting as the test set with the remaining 90%
of trials acting as a training set. To estimate the statistical certainty of these results we used boot-
strapping with 124 repetitions (except in the case of the null hypotheses where 1240 repetitions
were used).
Ensemble decoding
Ensemble decoding proceeded very similarly to the single-unit case. The ISI probability distributions
for each neuron in the ensemble were calculated independently as described above. However, while
decoding a given trial, the spike trains of all neurons in the ensemble were used to simultaneously
update the beliefs about stimulus category and behavioral choice. In other words, p(stimulus, t) and
p(choice, t) were shared for the entire ensemble but each neuron updated them independently using
Bayes’ rule whenever a new ISI was encountered. Correlations between neurons were ignored and
each of the ISIs from each cell were assumed to were assumed to be independent. For example, if
an ISI is observed at time t from neuron j with a likelihood pj:
p targetjISI; t
ð
Þ ¼
pj ISIjtarget; t

pj ISIjtarget; t

This process is repeated every time a new ISI is encountered from any cell in the ensemble.
The joint likelihood of observing a set of ISIs during a trial is then the product of the likelihoods
of each neuron independently. For example, for a two neuron ensemble, the combined likelihood,
p12, of observing the set ISIi
f
g1 from neuron 1 and ISIi

where pj is the likelihood of observing a given set of ISIs from neuron j.
Synthetic spike trains
To test the null hypothesis that the ISI-based single-trial Bayesian decoder performance was indistin-
guishable from chance, synthetic spike trains were constructed for each trial of a given unit by ran-
domly sampling with replacement from the set of all observed ISIs regardless of the original task
variable values (synthetic spike trains, Figure 4E). In principle under this condition, ISIs should no
longer bear any relationship to the task variables and decoding performance should be close to
50%. For single-unit responses, this randomization was completed 1240 times. Significance from the
null was assessed by a direct comparison to the 124 bootstrapped values observed from the true
data to the 1240 values observed under the null hypotheses. The p-value was determined as the
probability of finding a value from this synthetic condition that produced better decoding perfor-
mance than the values actually observed as in a standard permutation test.
As a secondary control, we used a traditional permutation test whereby observed spike trains
were left intact, but the task variables that correspond to each spike train were randomly permuted
(condition permutation, Figure 4F). This process was completed 1240 times.
Rate-modulated Poisson decoding
To decode using the trial-averaged firing rate, we implemented a standard method (Rieke et al.,
1999) which uses the probability of observing a set of n spikes at times t1, . . ., tn assuming those
spikes were generated by a rate-modulated Poisson process (Figure 4—figure supplement 4). Just
as with this ISI-based decoder, we decoded activity from the entire trial. First, we use a training set
comprising 90% of trials to estimate the time-varying firing rate for each condition from the PSTH

straightforward to interpret: the first product is the probability of observing spikes the spikes at the

of spike labels) and the exponential term represents the probability of silence in the periods
between spikes. For comparison with our method, we can reformulate this equation using interspike
intervals, if we first break up the exponential integral into domains that span the observed interspike
intervals.

where Dti is the time difference between spikes ti and ti+1. The interpretation of each term in the

Inferring the ISI distribution predicted by a rate-modulated Poisson
process
To compare the ISI distribution inferred using non-parametric methods to one predicted by a rate-
modulated Poisson process, we use the relationship above to calculate the predicted probability of
observing an ISI of given length within the 1 s window used for our non-parametric estimates. The
formula above assumes a spike has already occurred at time t, so we multiply by the probability of

In other words, the probability of observing an ISI beginning at time t is simply the probability of

The probability of observing an ISI at any time within a time window spanning wi to wf is simply

Regression-based method for verifying multiplexing
For each cell, we fit a Logit model for both the stimulus and choice decoding probabilities on indi-
vidual trials with the true stimulus category and behavioral choice as regressors. We then calculated
the extent to which the stimulus decoding probability was determined by true stimulus category by
subtracting the regression coefficient for stimulus from that of choice (Figure 4—figure supplement
3A,x-axis, stimulus selectivity index); when this number is positive it indicates that stimulus was a
stronger predictor of stimulus decoding on a trial-by-trial basis. The same process was repeated for
choice (Figure 4—figure supplement 3A,y-axis, choice selectivity index). According to this analysis,
we took multiplexed cells to be those that were positive for both measures (Figure 4—figure sup-
plement 3A, orange symbols, 19/90 cells). In other words, multiplexed cells were cells for which
stimulus decoding probabilities were primarily a result of true stimulus category and choice decod-
ing probabilities were primarily a result of true behavioral choice.
Given the moderate negative correlation for these indices, we projected each of these points
onto their linear regression to create a one-dimensional regression-based uniplexing index. Cells
with a value near zero are the multiplexed cells described above and cells with positive or negative
values are primarily stimulus or choice selective (Figure 4—figure supplement 3A).
We compared the uniplexing values produced by this regression method to those produced by
examining only the average decoding performance for stimulus and choice (Figure 4—figure sup-
plement 3B). A decoding-based uniplexing index was defined as the difference between average
stimulus and choice decoding for each cell. When these two values are comparable, this measure
returns a value close to zero and the cell is considered multiplexed; moreover, cells that are uni-
plexed for stimulus or choice receive positive and negative values, respectively, just as with the
regression-based measure. While the overall magnitude of these two measures need not be related,
both measures of multi/uniplexing rank cells on a one-dimensional axis from choice uniplexed to
multiplexed to stimulus uniplexed centered on zero.
Weighted log likelihood ratio
The log likelihood ratio (LLR) was calculated by first calculating the conditional ISI probabilities and
then taking the difference of the logarithm of these distributions. For stimulus,

Consensus and unsigned consensus
The consensus value evaluates the extent to which the LLR (or weighted LLR) is shared across an
ensemble. It is the norm of the sum of the LLRs (W. LLRs) divided by the sum of the norms. In princi-
ple, the functional norm can be anything but in this case we used the l1 norm (the absolute area
under the curve),

:
For the unsigned consensus, we first generate every permutation of the LLRs used and their inver-
ses, -LLR, up to an overall sign. For example, for a pair of LLRs there are only two options,
ðLLR1;LLR2ÞorðLLR1;�LLR2Þ;
and for three LLRs there are four options,
ðLLR1;LLR2;LLR3Þ;ð�LLR1;LLR2;LLR3Þ;ðLLR1;�LLR2;LLR3Þ; orðLLR1;LLR2;�LLR3Þ
The consensus is then calculated over each these sets and the maximum value is taken to be the
value of the unsigned consensus.
To generate the consensus curves in Figure 8, LLRs are calculated using a 750 ms sliding window
recalculated every 100 ms. The resulting consensus value is assigned to the center of the 750 ms
window. For visual clarity, these values were interpolated by a third-degree univariate spline calcu-
lated using the python package scipy.interpolate.InterpolatedUnivariateSpline (this technique is
guaranteed to intercept the measured values).
Analysis of Rodgers and DeWeese (2014) dataset
Using our novel ISI-based decoding algorithm, we analyzed cells found to be non-classically respon-
sive in a previously published study (Rodgers and DeWeese, 2014). Briefly, rats were trained on a
novel auditory stimulus selection task where animals had to respond to one of two cues while ignor-
ing the other depending on the context. Rats held their nose in a center port for 250 to 350 ms and
were then presented with two simultaneous sounds (a white noise burst played from only the left or
right speaker and a high- or low-pitched warble played from both speakers). In the ‘localization’ con-
text, animals were trained to ignore the warble and respond to the location of the white noise burst
and in the ‘pitch’ context they were trained to ignore the location of the white noise burst and
respond to the pitch of the warble. Cells recorded from both primary auditory cortex and prefrontal
cortex (prelimbic region) were shown to be classically responsive to the selection rule during the
pre-stimulus period (i.e. firing rates differed between the two contexts). Non-classically responsive
cells were reported but not further analyzed.
We established that cells were non-classically responsive for the stimulus location or pitch using
our own positive statistical criteria for non-classical responsiveness (described above) by comparing
the average spiking activity in the 250 ms stimulus period and the 250 ms following stimulus to inter-
trial baseline activity. Cells were also determined to be non-classically responsive for ramping using
the same criteria as with our own data. We confirmed that cells were non-classically responsive for
the selection rule by comparing their average spiking activity in the 100 ms immediately preceding
stimulus onset across contexts.

 To determine whether non-classically responsive cells also encoded task information (stimulus
location, stimulus pitch, behavioral choice, and the selection rule), we decoded each variable on sin-
gle-trials using our ISI-based decoding algorithm. Selection rule information was only assessed in the
pre-stimulus hold period, whereas stimulus and choice information was assessed in the period after
stimulus onset prior to behavioral response (as with our own data). Cells shown in Figure 5B were
deemed statistically significant when compared to the decoding performance of a control using syn-
thetically generated data (p<0.05).
Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed in Python, MATLAB, or GraphPad Prism 6. Datasets were
tested for normality, and appropriate statistical tests applied as described in the text (e.g. Student’s
paired t-test for normally distributed data, Mann-Whitney U test for unmatched non-parametric
data, and Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test for matched non-parametric data).
