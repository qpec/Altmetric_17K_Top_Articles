On April 26, 2016, this report was posted as an MMWR Early 
Release on the MMWR website (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr). 
On March 28, 2016, two patients were evaluated at the 
Contra Costa Regional Medical Center emergency depart-
ment (ED) in Contra Costa County, California, for nausea, 
vomiting, central nervous system depression, and respiratory 
depression, 30 minutes after ingesting what appeared to be 
Norco, a prescription opioid pain medication that contains 
acetaminophen and hydrocodone. The patients purchased the 
drug from a friend a few days earlier. The two cases of drug 
intoxication were reported to a Contra Costa County Health 
Department public health official who subsequently notified 
the California State Health Department.
Three days earlier, the Sacramento County Division of 
Public Health had released a Drug Overdose Health Alert 
regarding multiple poisoning overdoses related to ingestion 
of fentanyl-contaminated counterfeit Norco in Sacramento 
County (1). All staff members at the California Poison Control 
System (CPCS) were alerted to increase vigilance for potential 
cases. In the subsequent 2 weeks, the CPCS San Francisco 
Division identified an additional five cases in three Bay Area 
counties (Alameda, San Francisco, and Santa Clara), including 
one case in a patient (patient 1) that was reported retrospec-
tively (Table). All patients reported to the CPCS San Francisco 
Division had various signs and symptoms of opioid intoxica-
tion after ingestion of the illicit product, and all recovered 
without clinical sequelae within 24 hours.
Although analyses of product and patient specimens from 
Sacramento County were reported to have contained fentanyl, 
all cases in the Bay Area also contained promethazine, which 
had not been reported as an additive in previous counterfeit 
or adulterated fentanyl-containing products. Fentanyl is a 
synthetic opioid analgesic that is a fullµ-opioid receptor agonist 
(one of the three opioid receptors through which opioids exert 
their pharmacologic actions) and has 100 times the potency 
of morphine (2). Fentanyl is available in many formulations, 
and its unique physicochemical properties, particularly its 
high lipophilicity, allow it to quickly enter the central ner-
vous system and are responsible for its high potency (2) and 
high potential for abuse. Fentanyl is not currently formulated 
for oral administration in pill or tablet form, however, and 
its presence in pill form is a marker for an illicitly produced 
product. Promethazine, a phenothiazine derivative, is routinely 
prescribed for the treatment of nausea, vomiting, and motion 
sickness. Promethazine use has recently been reported to be 
common among chronic opioid users and is thought to poten-
tiate the “high” from opioids (3).
Initial Case Reports
Patient 2 was a man aged 36 years who went to the 
ED with his girlfriend (patient 3), concerned that he was 
experiencing an adverse reaction to an illicitly purchased 
drug. He bought what he believed to be Norco tablets 
from a friend a few days earlier and described the tablets 
as having the inscription “M367,” and looking exactly like 
Norco tablets that had been previously prescribed to him 
after a shoulder cartilage repair. He had ingested half of 
one street-purchased tablet approximately 12 hours earlier, 
and two additional tablets 30 minutes before arriving in 
the ED. In the ED, he was afebrile with stable vital signs 
and blood oxygen saturation 99% on room air. Electrolytes 
and blood chemistries were within normal ranges. Physical 
examination was notable for lethargy. He was administered 
a 0.4-mg dose of intramuscular naloxone with transient 
improvement in his mental status; however, 1.5 hours later, 
he experienced respiratory depression with a decline in his 
oxygen saturation to 90%, which improved with adminis-
tration of supplemental oxygen. Acetaminophen level was 
<10µg/mL. Urine drug screen was positive for opiates. He 
was observed for 6 hours and discharged home.
Patient 3, a woman aged 30 years, came to the ED with her 
boyfriend (patient 2), also having ingested two of the street-
purchased “Norco” tablets 30 minutes before arrival. After 
ingestion, she complained of dizziness and became unresponsive, 
and her boyfriend initiated cardiopulmonary resuscitation and 
contacted emergency responders, who noted that her blood 
oxygen saturation was 93% on room air. A 0.4-mg dose of IV 
naloxone was administered, and on arrival at the ED, her physi-
cal exam was notable for lethargy and bradypnea (8 breaths/
minute), and blood oxygen saturation of 98% on 2 L of oxy-
gen via nasal cannula. She received a second 0.4-mg dose of 
IV naloxone 6 hours after arrival. Laboratory results were normal 
except for a slightly elevated white blood cell count (13,400/µL 
[normal = 4,000–10,000]). Acetaminophen level was <10µg/mL 
and urine drug screen was positive for opiates. She had persis-
tent nausea and vomiting, and was admitted to the hospital for

overnight observation. Her symptoms improved, and she was 
discharged home 32 hours after her arrival.
Laboratory Analyses
Tablets purchased by another patient (patient 6) were 
provided to the hospital staff. The tablets and serum speci-
mens from all seven patients were analyzed using liquid 
chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry (4). Levels 
of fentanyl, acetaminophen, and hydrocodone were quanti-
fied. Additional drugs were also detected in the serum (Table).
Analysis of a tablet obtained from patient 6 indicated that it 
contained 3.5 mg of fentanyl, 2.3 mg of promethazine, 39.2 mg 
of acetaminophen, and trace amounts of cocaine. All patients 
had serum fentanyl levels of 1.6–10.1 ng/mL (therapeutic range

in excess of the therapeutic range (5). All patients had detect-
able acetaminophen levels, although well below therapeutic 
levels (10–30µg/mL). Only three patients had hydrocodone 
levels above the lower level of quantification, and all were 
below the therapeutic level (10–40 ng/mL). Specimens from 
all patients contained promethazine.
Discussion
Response to this outbreak has included notification of the 
California Department of Public Health, local media outlets, 
and law enforcement officials. On April 4, 2016, the Drug 
Enforcement Administration (DEA) launched an anonymous 
tip line in San Francisco. No information has been released 
regarding the source of the counterfeit tablets, and an inves-
tigation is ongoing.
The distribution of counterfeit medications, especially 
those containing fentanyl, is an emerging and serious pub-
lic health threat. Opioid abuse is the fastest-growing drug 
problem in the United States; despite prevention strategies 
at federal, state, and local levels, deaths caused by ingestion 
of opioid analgesics continue (6). In addition to prescription 
drug abuse, nonpharmaceutical illicitly produced opioid-
containing products have received much attention in recent 
years. Fentanyl, in particular, was responsible for more than 
1,000 deaths during 2005–2007 (7). In March 2015, DEA 
issued a nationwide alert about the dangers of illicitly produced 
fentanyl and fentanyl compounds, describing these products as 
a threat to health and public safety (8). In California, during 
October–December 2015, seven persons, including two who 
died, were found to have been exposed to fentanyl-adulterated 
counterfeit Xanax (9).
Efforts to identify the source of the current counterfeiting 
are ongoing. Patients with signs and symptoms of acute opioid 
overdose including central nervous system and respiratory 
depression, and in whom larger doses of naloxone are required 
to reverse symptoms, should raise suspicion for intoxication 
with a counterfeit product containing fentanyl. Physicians 
should inquire about the illegal purchase of prescription 
medications in these cases and notify their local poison control 
centers and health departments. Efforts should also be made to 
communicate to the general public the significant risks to life 
and health when purchasing what appears to be prescription 
medications from any source other than a reputable pharmacy 
or health care provider, because it might be difficult to dis-
tinguish a counterfeit pill from the legitimate pharmaceutical 
product (Figure).

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
The United States is experiencing an opioid epidemic with 
synthetic opioids such as fentanyl responsible for the highest 
rise in death rates in recent years. Fentanyl, a potent opioid 
receptor agonist, can cause significant central nervous system 
and respiratory depression and has been implicated in multiple 
outbreaks in the past decade.
What is added by this report?
During March 25–April 5, 2016, seven cases of counterfeit Norco 
ingestion and intoxication were identified by the San Francisco 
Division of the California Poison Control System. Whereas Norco 
typically contains acetaminophen and hydrocodone, these 
counterfeit tablets predominantly contained fentanyl and 
promethazine. Prior to this outbreak in the Bay Area, counterfeit 
or adulterated fentanyl-containing products had not previously 
been reported to include promethazine as an additive. 
Promethazine likely potentiates the opioid effect. 
What are the implications for public health practice?
The distribution of counterfeit tablets represents a major public 
health threat given the potentially lethal nature of the tablets. 
Health care providers should be aware of this and other 
concurrent outbreaks and notify local poison centers and health 
departments of suspected cases. Collaborative efforts among 
public health, medical, and law enforcement officials are 
essential for a rapid and effective response.
