Guideline development group for non-specific back pain*
SUMMARY
Background: For many years, low back pain has been both 
the leading cause of days lost from work and the leading 
indication for medical rehabilitation. The goal of the 
 
German Disease Management Guideline (NDMG)  
on non-
specific low back pain is to improve the treatment of 
 
patients with this condition.
Methods: The current update of the NDMG on non-specific 
low back pain is based on articles retrieved by a system-
atic search of the literature for systematic reviews. Its 
 
recommendations for diagnosis and treatment were 
 
developed by a collaborative effort of 29 scientific medical 
societies and organizations and approved in a formal 
 
consensus process.
Results: If the history and physical examination do not 
 
arouse any suspicion of a dangerous underlying cause, no 
further diagnostic evaluation is indicated for the time 
being. Passive, reactive measures should be taken only in 
combination with activating measures, or not at all. When 
drugs are used for symptomatic treatment, patients should 
be treated with the most suitable drug in the lowest 
 
possible dose and for as short a time as possible.
Conclusion: A physician should be in charge of the overall 
care process. The patient should be kept well informed 
over the entire course of his or her illness and should be 
encouraged to adopt a healthful lifestyle, including regular 
physical exercise.

or many years, low back pain has been both the lead-
ing cause of days lost from work and the leading indi-
cation for medical rehabilitation (1, 2). Musculoskeletal 
diseases have been second only to mental disorders in re-
cent years as a cause of early retirement due to loss of the 
ability to work (3). In 2010, 26% of all adults participating 
in the mandatory nationwide health insurance system in 
Germany sought medical help at least once because of low 
back pain (4). The new update of the German Disease 
management Guideline (NDMG)  
on non-specific low 
back pain (5) contains many new elements. Among other 
things, psychosocial and workplace-related factors are 
given more emphasis, multiple imaging procedures are 
 
discouraged, and early multidisciplinary assessment is 
 
recommended. Moreover, both the guideline’s positive rec-
ommendations, such as those for less intensive diagnostic 
evaluation and for exercise rather than bed rest, and its 
negative recommendations, such as the recommendation 
against passive measures, are now supported by high-level 
evidence and confirmed by the guideline group.
Method
The following instruments were used in the creation of the 
NDMG: 
● The concepts of the Guidelines International Network 
(G-I-N),
● the guideline criteria of the German Medical Associ-
ation (Bundesärztekammer, BÄK) and the National 
Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians 
(Kassenärztliche Bundesvereinigung, KBV) (6),
● the guideline regulations of the Association of the 
Scientific Medical Societies in Germany (Arbeitsge-
meinschaft der Wissenschaftlichen Medizinischen 
Fachgesellschaften, AWMF) (e1), and 
● the German Guideline Evaluation Instrument (Deut-
sches Leitlinienbewertungsinstrument, DELBI) (e2). 
The essentials of the guideline-creating procedure are 
described in the methods report (e3), and specific details 
are described in the guideline report (e4). The current 
 
version of the NDMG on non-specific back pain was devel-
oped from March 2015 to March 2017 by a multidiscipli-
nary guideline group (eBox 1). It was then organized by the 
German Association for Quality Assurance in Medicine 
(Ärztliches Zentrum für Qualität in der Medizin, ÄZQ). All 
of the participants’ conflicts of interest have been 
 
documented and made public, as stipulated by the AWMF 
(e4).

Evidence base
For this update, a systematic search was carried out in Med-
line (via PubMed) and the Cochrane database for aggre-
gated evidence regarding non-specific low back pain 
 
(eTable 1). In a two-step procedure, the retrieved articles 
were examined and their key questions and recommen-
dations 
were 
classified, 
extracted, 
and 
evaluated 
 
(eFigure 1) (e4). On some issues, such as the use of opioids 
to treat acute, non-specific back pain, supplementary 
searches for primary studies were carried out. Moreover, 
the S3 guideline on the long-term use of opioids to treat 
non-cancer pain (LONTS) (7) was used as a reference 
guideline.
Recommendation grades and consensus process
Recommendation grades were assigned in consideration of 
the following:
● the strength of the underlying evidence
● ethical commitments
● the clinical relevance of the effect strengths that were 
documented in the studies
● the applicability of the study findings to the target 
 
patient group 
● patient preferences
● and the practicality of implementation in routine 
clinical practice. 
Two upward arrows (↑↑) indicate a strong recom-
mendation, a single upward arrow (↑) indicates a weak 
recommendation, and a horizontal double arrow (↔) 
indicates an open recommendation. The recommen-
dations, algorithms, and information for patients were 
agreed upon in a formalized, written voting procedure 
(Delphi process) or in a consensus conference 
 
(nominal group process). The draft guideline was made 
accessible for public comment in September 2016 
(www.versorgungsleitlinien.de). Potential consequences 
of the comments that were received were voted upon in 
a written  
Delphi process (e4). 
Results
Diagnostic evaluation
If the initial history and physical examination of a patient 
with low back pain do not yield any sign of a dangerous 
course of the disease or other serious conditions, no 
further diagnostic steps should be undertaken for the time 
being (↑↑, expert consensus). Restricting the diagnostic 
evaluation spares the patient an unnecessary burden while 
avoiding unnecessary costs for the health-care system (e5). 
Intensive diagnostic evaluation that is not justified by clini-
cal findings will only exceptionally result in a relevant, spe-
cific diagnosis and may well promote the patient’s fixation 
on his or her condition and the chronification of pain 
(e6–e8). The Figure is a depiction of the diagnostic course 
of a patient with acute low back pain or a new episode of 
recurrent back pain, starting from the initial contact with a 
physician. If any somatic warning signs (“red flags”) are 
present (eBox 2), then further imaging or laboratory tests 
and/or referral to a specialist should ensue, depending on 
the particular diagnosis that is suspected and its degree of 
urgency (↑↑, expert consensus).
Psychosocial and workplace-related risk factors 
(eBox 2) should be considered from the beginning (↑↑, ex-
pert consensus). After four weeks of persistent pain with an 
inadequate response to treatment that has been provided in 
accordance with the guideline (eFigure 2), the coordinating 
physician should assess psychosocial risk factors (“yellow 
flags”) with a standardized screening instrument (e.g., the 
STarT Back Tool or the Örebro Short Questionnaire) (↑, 
expert consensus) and may also assess workplace-related 
factors with a standardized screening instrument (↔, 
 
expert consensus). Patient information and related ques-
tionnaires are freely accessible via the German-language 
website www.kreuzschmerz.versorgungsleitlinien.de.
Imaging
Patients with acute or recurrent low back pain in whom the 
history and physical examination yield no evidence of a 
dangerous course of the disease or other serious condition 
should not undergo any imaging (↓↓, [8, 9]). A systematic 
review of randomized and controlled trials (RCTs) revealed 
that, among patients with acute or subacute low back pain 
who have no clinical evidence of a serious condition, the 
intensity of pain at three months or at 6–12 months was no 
different in those who underwent imaging immediately 
than in those who had no imaging at all (standardized mean 
difference [SMD] at 3 months 0.11, 95% confidence inter-
val [−0.29; 0.50]; corresponding figures at 6 months, −0.04 
[−0.15; 0.07]), and at 12 months 0.01; [−0.17; 0.19]); the 
two groups of patients received the same treatment (8). 
These data were confirmed by a prospective cohort study 
involving 5239 patients over age 65 with acute low back 
pain: at one year, there was no difference in functional abil-
ity between patients who underwent imaging at an early or 
late date (i.e., less vs. more than 6 weeks after diagnosis). 
The SMD and confidence interval figures were, for plain 
x-rays, −0.10 [−0.71; 0.5]; for magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) and computed tomography (CT), −0.51; [−1.62; 
0.60]) (9). Moreover, imaging can lead to unnecessary 
treatment and promote chronification (10). Patient 
 
information leaflets were developed as an aid to physician-
patient communication on this topic.
Most patients experience appreciable improvement with-
in 6 weeks (11). For patients whose low back pain continues 
to limit their physical activity or has worsened despite treat-
ment in accordance with the guideline (eFigure 2), the indi-
cation for diagnostic imaging should be reassessed in 4 to 6 
weeks (↑↑, expert consensus based on [10, 12]). Early 
 
reassessment in 2–4 weeks may be necessary if a currently 
employed patient has been unable to work for a consider-
able period of time, or if a diagnostic evaluation is required 
before the initiation of multimodal treatment. The authors 
of the guideline consider one-time diagnostic imaging to be 
justified as part of such an assessment, alongside the history 
and physical examination. Nevertheless, imaging that lacks 
any potential therapeutic relevance should be avoided. 
After 4–6 weeks of pain, physicians should place 
greater emphasis on the search for a specific somatic 
cause than at the patient’s initial presentation. Even in 
patients with persistent pain, however, the physician should 
first consider whether the symptoms and course might not

 M E D I C I N E
be accounted for by other risk factors or by the individual 
history. Current evidence does not support routine imaging 
(e.g., MRI) for chronic, non-specific low back pain (12).
An analysis of claims data by WIdO (which is the 
 
scientific department of AOK, a German health-insurance 
carrier) revealed that 26% of patients with low back pain 
underwent two instances of diagnostic imaging of the lum-
bar spine within 5 years, and 27% underwent three or more 
(4). Patients with unchanged symptoms should not undergo 
repeated imaging (↓↓, expert consensus), as there is no 
 
reason to expect any relevant structural changes calling for 
a change in the treatment strategy. If the symptoms change, 
however, the indications for imaging may need to be 
 
reassessed.  
Multidisciplinary assessment
Patients whose activities in everyday life are still restricted 
and who still have inadequate relief of pain despite 12 
weeks of treatment in accordance with the guideline, as 
well as patients with an exacerbation of chronic 
 
non- 
specific low back pain, should undergo multidiscipli-
nary assessment (↑↑, expert consensus). Patients at high 
risk of chronification should undergo such an assessment 
after 6 weeks of persistent pain (eFigure 2). In the 
 
assessment, the patient’s symptoms are evaluated as com-
prehensively and holistically as possible and the findings 
are discussed in a multidisciplinary case conference, where 
plans are made for further diagnostic evaluation and 
 
treatment.

In the outpatient setting, the principles of multidiscipli-
nary assessment are best met by combining the diagnostic 
expertise of the physician, the physical therapist, and the 
psychologist. Broad implementation is generally difficult 
in ambulatory care but is feasible in the German health care 
system with the aid of an “integrated care contract” (IV-
 
Vertrag; IV = integrierte Versorgung). Such assessments 
are regularly performed in multidisciplinary pain centers, 
which are entitled to obtain reimbursement for them, but 
usually only in a later phase of the course of the disease (13).
The management of low back pain
A physician should be responsible the overall care process 
(Figure and eFigure 2) (↑↑, expert consensus). Over the 
course of the disease, the physician should continually ex-
plain the condition and the treatment to the patient and 
should encourage the pursuit of a healthful lifestyle, includ-
ing regular physical exercise (↑↑, [e9–e13]). Recommen-
dations for special situations are summarized in Box 1. The 
diagnostic and therapeutic process for patients with persist-
ent low back pain is presented in eFigure 2. 
Non-pharmacological treatment
Patients should be instructed to continue their usual 
 
physical activities as much as possible (↑↑, [14]). System-
atic reviews of RCTs have shown that bed rest for patients 
with acute non-specific low back pain either has no effect 
or actually delays recovery and the resumption of everyday

Care requirements in special situations*
● Pharmacotherapy for longer periods of time (>4 weeks)  
– need for the continuation of pharmacotherapy
– �side effects (e.g., gastrointestinal symptoms due to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAID])
– interactions with other drugs
– appropriate dosing; dose reduction or switch to another drug if necessary (consultation with specialist)
– use of suitable non-pharmacological measures, e.g., psychosocial interventions
– need for specialized work-up or follow-up of pre-existing or new comorbidities
– �need for the initiation of multimodal treatment 
● Discharge from multimodal treatment
– support with the initiation and adaptation of treatment measures; monitoring of implementation if necessary
– �stepwise reintroduction to the workplace or initiation of occupational reintegration measures
– �initiation and coordination of further psychotherapeutic care, if necessary
– coordination of continued care by a specialist, if necessary 
– consideration of the patient‘s disability and compensation status (consequent to medical judgments) and its potential 
 
effects on health, if necessary
● Persistent chronification factors and/or psychosocial consequences of the painful condition
– basic psychosomatic care
– �regular screening for chronification factors
– �initiation and coordination of further psychotherapeutic care, if necessary; the patient should be encouraged to participate 
as a component of medical treatment
– possibly social counseling with respect to disability and compensation, or initiation of such counseling
– �possibly suggestion of measures for occupational reintegration and/or retraining 
● Symptom-maintaining or symptom-reinforcing comorbidities  
(e.g., affective disorders such as anxiety and depression, or somatoform disorders) 
– �regular appointments for treatment; unscheduled visits only in case of an emergency 
– basic psychosomatic care 
–  
initiation and coordination of disorder-specific treatment 
● Continued inability to work 
– screening for workplace-related risk factors 
– contact with company physician (if there is one) and, if necessary, with employer (after discussion with the patient)  
or pension insurance company 
– consider and, if necessary, initiate measures to support occupational reintegration

activities, leading to longer periods of medically excused 
absence from work (14, 15). Bed rest should not be a part of 
the treatment of non-specific low back pain, and patients 
should be advised against it (↓↓, [14, 15]).
Exercise therapy combined with educative measures 
based on behavioral-therapeutic principles should be used 
in the primary treatment of chronic non-specific low back 
pain (↑↑, [16, e14–e38]). It yields more effective pain re-
duction and better functional ability than can be achieved 
with general medical care and passive treatment measures 
(16, e14–e34). Programs for strengthening and stabilizing 
the musculature seem to relieve low back pain better than 
programs with a cardiopulmonary orientation (e35, e36). 
Reviews of RCTs have shown that exercise programs based 
on a behavior-therapeutic approach improve physical func-
tional ability and speed up the return to work (e22, e37). 
Current evidence does not show which specific type of 
 
exercise therapy is best for pain relief and improved func-
tional ability (e14–e34). The choice of exercise therapy is, 
therefore, based mainly on the patient’s preference, 
 
everyday life circumstances, and physical fitness and the 
availability of a qualified therapist to carry it out (e39).
Weaker recommendations are given for rehabilitative 
sports and functional training (↑, expert consensus) and 
progressive muscle relaxation (↑, [e40]). Self-administered 
heat therapy (↔, [15, e41–e43]), manual therapies such as 
manipulation and mobilization (↔, [e44–e47]), massage 
(↔, [17, e34, e48, e49]), ergotherapy (↔, [e50]), “back 
school” (↔, [17, e51–e54]), and acupuncture (↔, [e28, 
e55–e57]) can be used to treat chronic low back pain as part 
of an overall concept in combination with activating thera-
peutic measures.
Strongly negative recommendations are given with 
 
regard to interventions for which there is little or no evi-
dence of benefit, even if there is no evidence of harm 
either. This is done so as not to imply that these methods 
are an acceptable alternative to maintaining physical 
 
activity; a passive approach to treatment should not be 
promoted. The authors of the guideline, considering this to 
be a relevant potential harm, have altered the recommen-
dation strengths accordingly. These interventions, while 
discouraged, may still be used in individual cases, in 
 
combination with physical exercise, as long as there is no 
evidence that they cause harm. Negative recommen-
dations are given for interference-current therapy 
(e58–e62), kinesiotaping (e63, e64), short-wave diather-
my (e65–e68), laser therapy (17, e69), magnetic field 
 
therapy (e70), medical aids (e71–e74), percutaneous elec-
trical nerve stimulation (PENS) (17, e75), traction devices 
(17, e76), cryotherapy (e41), transcutaneous electrical 
nerve stimulation (TENS), and therapeutic ultrasound 
(e77, e78).
Pharmacotherapy
The treatment of non-specific low back pain with drugs is 
purely symptomatic. In the acute phase, drugs are used to 
support non-pharmacologic measures, so that the patient 
can return to his or her usual activities as soon as possible. 
The treatment of chronic low back pain with drugs is 
 
indicated if the physician considers it potentially helpful for 
the implementation of activating measures, or else when, 
despite the appropriate performance of these measures, the 
patient still has an intolerable functional impairment due to 
pain.
Overall, there is moderate evidence with a low-to-
 
intermediate effect size showing that  
treatment with 
drugs relieves acute and chronic non-specific low back 
pain. Particularly long-term treatment carries relevant 
risks including major adverse effects. It follows that the 
physician must carefully weigh the risks and benefits of 
pharmacotherapy 
when 
starting 
pharmacotherapy 
(Box 2).
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) are the 
pain-relieving drugs most likely recommended. Multiple 
reviews have documented the short-term analgesic effect 
and the functional benefit of oral NSAID, compared to 
placebo, in patients with acute and chronic non-specific 
low back pain, with a median difference of −5.96 points 
[−10.96; −0.96] at 16 weeks on a Visual Analog Scale rang-
ing from 0 to 100 (15, 18–21). To minimize side effects 
NSAIDs should be given in the lowest effective dose 
and for the shortest possible time (↑). Considering the 
BOX 2
The principles of pharmacotherapy for non-specific 
low back pain
The following principles apply regardless of the choice of drug and the mode of 
its introduction and administration (↑↑, expert consensus):
–  
The patient should be informed that drugs are only a supportive measure for 
persons with low back pain. 
–  
A realistic, relevant therapeutic goal should be set, with reference to physical 
function (e.g., an increase in the distance the patient can walk or in some other 
type of physical exertion, relevant pain relief [>30% or >50%]).
–  
The drug should be chosen on an individual basis, with due consideration of 
comorbidities and comedication, drug intolerances, and the patient’s prior expe-
riences and preferences (see also the guideline on multiple drug prescription 
[DEGAM)] [e79] and the PRISCUS and FORTA lists [DGIM] [e80, e81]).
–  
The dose of the drug should be titrated in steps until the benefit is achieved at 
the lowest possible dose. 
–  
The patient should be monitored at regular intervals (ca. every 4 weeks) to 
 
assess the desired and undesired effects of medication. 
–  
Drugs for acute pain should be stopped or tapered to off when the pain 
 
improves.
–  
Drug treatment should be continued only if effective and well tolerated; its 
 
effects should be monitored at regular intervals (every three months).
–  
Drugs that are inadequately effective (despite appropriately prescribed doses) 
or that cause relevant side effects should be stopped or tapered to off.

contraindications, COX-2-inhibitors can be used if 
NSAIDs are contraindicated or poorly tolerated 
 
(off-label-use) (↔, [18–20]).
In individual cases, metamizole can be considered as 
an treatment option if non-opiod analgesics are con-
traindicated or poorly tolerated. (↔, expert consensus). 
The systematic literature search yielded no reviews docu-
menting its efficacy against non-specific low back pain. 
The Medicines Committee of the German Medical Associ-
ation (Arzneimittelkommission der deutschen Ärzteschaft, 
AkdÄ) recommends its use only for the approved 
 
indications (severe pain for which other treatments are not 
indicated) and states that the patient must be adequately 
 
informed about its side effects, particularly the manifes-
tations of agranulocytosis, which include fever, sore throat, 
and lesions of the oral mucosa. Monitoring of the complete 
blood count is recommended whenever agranulocytosis is 
suspected, as well as for all patients taking the drug over the 
long term (22). 
In the light of new evidence, paracetamol ( = acetamino 
-
phen) should no longer be used (↓, [23]). In comparison to 
placebo, the use of this drug did not lead to any improve-
ment in pain (weighted mean difference [WMD] 1.4 [−1.3; 
4.1]) or functional ability (WMD −1.9 [−4.8; 1.0]) in pa-
tients with either acute or chronic non-specific low back 
pain. Nor should flupirtine be used to treat non-specific low 
back pain (↓↓, [24–32]): its inadequately documented bene-
fit is outweighed by its risks—mainly hepatotoxicity, rang-
ing from elevated liver function parameters to organ failure, 
and potential dependence (27–29) (cf. the risk assessment of 
the  
European Medicines Agency [EMA] [33]).
Opioid drugs can be a treatment option for acute 
 
non-specific low back pain if non-opioid analgesics are 
contraindicated or have been found to be ineffective in 
the individual patient (↔, [e82–e86]). The indication 
for opioid drugs should be regularly reassessed at inter-
vals of no longer than 4 weeks (↑↑, [7]). They can be 
used to treat chronic non-specific low back pain for 4 to 
12 weeks initially (↔, [19, 34–36]). If this brief period 
of treatment brings about a relevant improvement in the 
patient’s pain and/or subjective physical impairment, 
while causing only minor or no side effects, then opioid 
drugs can also be a long-term therapeutic option (↔, 
[37]). In the review articles that were identified for the

Long-term treatment
Cessation of treatment
– long-acting drugs,  
sustained-release preparations
– oral intake is generally preferred; transdermal systems might be an option if oral intake is 
 
contraindicated
– note the side-effect profile of the opioid analgesic drug 
– consider the patient’s comorbidities
– take patient preferences into account
– agree on treatment goals
– educate the patient about side effects, risk of addiction, traffic safety
– start at a low dose
– fixed dosing schedule
– incrementally raise dose depending on efficacy and tolerability 
– the optimal dose is the one at which the treatment goals are met with tolerable (or no) side effects
– the oral morphine-equivalent dose should not exceed 120 mg/day, with rare exceptions
– short-term use of non-sustained-release oral opioid analgesic drugs can be given “as needed” as an 
aid to titration
– no non-sustained-release oral opioid analgesic drugs administered as needed
– if the pain worsens, add-on therapy with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) should be 
tried first, rather than an increase of the opioid dose
– reevaluate at regular intervals:
  –  
attainment of treatment goals
  –  
side effects (e.g., loss of libido, psychological changes such as loss of interest, inattention, falls) 
  –  
evidence of inappropriate use of prescribed medication
–  
after 6 months of treatment with good response:
  – consider dose reduction or cessation
  – reassess the indication for continued treatment and the response to non- 
pharmacological treatment
– individual treatment goals attainable by other therapeutic measures
– individual treatment goals not met after 4–12 weeks of opioid therapy
– appearance of intolerable or inadequately treatable side effects 
– persistent loss of effect despite modification of opioid therapy (dose adjustment, change of drug)
– inappropriate use of prescribed opioid analgesic drug by the patient despite treatment in collabora 
-
tion with an addiction specialist 
– the cessation of opioid analgesic treatment must be gradual

creation of this guideline, the administration of opioid 
drugs (weak and strong, oral and transdermal) for a brief 
or intermediate period of time (4 to 26 weeks) signifi-
cantly reduced pain (SMD: −0.43 [−0.52; −0.33]) and 
mildly improved physical functional ability (SMD: 
−0.26 [−0.37; −0.15]) compared to placebo (19, 34–36). 
Open long-term observations from the late observa-
tional phase of RCTs have revealed long-term analgesic 
efficacy in approximately 25% of the patients initially 
included in the trials (37). The most important points to 
be considered with respect to opioid therapy are 
 
summarized in the Table.
Invasive treatments
Non-specific low back pain should not be treated with 
 
percutaneous procedures (↓↓, [e34, e87–e94]) or with sur-
gery (↓↓, [e95–e103]). Nor should intravenously, intra-
muscularly, or subcutaneously administered analgesic 
drugs, local anesthetics, glucocorticoids, or mixed 
 
infusions be used (↓↓, [e104–e112]).
Multimodal treatment programs
Patients with subacute and chronic non-specific low 
back pain should be treated in multimodal programs if 
less intensive evidence-based treatments have yielded an 
insufficient benefit (↑↑, [17, 38, 39]). Trials have shown 
the superiority of multimodal programs over traditional 
treatments, waiting lists, or less intensive forms of 
 
treatment (17, 38, 39). According to the most recent 
 
review, including data from a total of 6858 study partici-
pants, multimodal treatment was better than traditional 
treatment at lowering pain intensity (SMD: −0.21 
[−0.37; −0.04]) and increasing physical functional 
 
ability (SMD: −0.23 [−0.40; −0.06]) at 12 months in pa-
tients with chronic, non-specific low back pain (38). The 
evidence in the underlying trials is of low to moderate 
quality, and some of the measured effects are weak. The 
heterogeneity of the findings can be attributed, in part, to 
wide variation in the content of the multimodal 
 
programs (39). In practice, such programs are offered by 
pain clinics and rehabilitation clinics (eTable 2).

KEY MESSAGES
● �If, on the initial contact of a patient complaining of low 
back pain with a physi 
cian, the history and physical 
examination yield no evidence of a dangerous or other-
wise serious pathological abnormality, no further studies 
are indicated for the time being. 
● �Psychosocial and workplace-related factors should be 
asked about at the  
initial contact. If the pain persists 
four weeks later despite treatment, these factors should be 
systematically assessed with standardized questionnaires. 
● �The physician should advise the patient to maintain or 
intensify physical exercise and should advise against 
bed rest. Exercise therapy should be used to treat chro-
nic non-specific low back pain. 
● �Analgesic drugs are only moderately effective; their 
main role is to support physical activity. Nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) are , under these cir-
cumstances, the most recommended drugs. 
● �Patients with persistent pain and relevant impairment in 
the activities of daily  
living after (at most) 12 weeks of 
treatment should undergo a multidisciplinary assess-
ment. Depending on the results of this assessment, 
they should then be offered multimodal treatment.

eBOX 2 
“Extravertebral” causes, somatic warning signs (“red flags”) and psychosocial risk factors for 
chronification (“yellow flags”)
“Extravertebral” causes of low back pain 
(due to processes affecting neighboring organs not belonging to the 
 
bony, muscular, or discoligamentous structures of the spine): 
–  
abdominal and visceral processes, e.g., cholecystitis, pancreatitis
– vascular changes, e.g., aortic aneurysms
–  
gynecological causes, e.g., endometriosis
–  
urological causes, e.g., urolithiasis, renal tumors, perinephric 
 
abscesses
– neurological disease, e.g., peripheral neuropathy
– mental and  
psychosomatic illnesses
Somatic warning signs (“red flags”)
● Fracture/osteoporosis
– severe trauma, e.g., due to automobile accident, fall  
from a height, 
sporting accident
–  
minimal trauma (e.g., coughing, sneezing, or heavy lifting) in an 
 
elderly patient or a patient with osteoporosis
– systemic steroid therapy
● Infection
–  
systemic symptoms, e.g., recent fever/chills, anorexia, fatigability 
– recent bacterial infection
–  
intravenous drug abuse
– immune suppression
–  
underlying debilitating disease
–  
recent spinal infiltration therapy
–  
severe pain at night
● Radiculopathy/neuropathy
– in younger patients, disk herniation as the most common cause of 
nerve root compression
– pain radiating down one or both legs in a dermatomal distribution, 
possibly associated with sensory disturbances such as numbness 
or tingling in the area of pain, and/or with weakness  
– cauda equina syndrome: bladder and bowel dysfunction of sudden 
onset, e.g. urinary retention, urinary frequency, incontinence 
–  
perianal/perineal sensory deficit
– marked or progressive neurologic deficit (weakness, sensory 
 
deficit) in one or both lower limbs 
–  
improvement of pain with simultaneous worsening of weakness, 
up to complete loss of function of the segmental muscle (“nerve 
root death”) 
● Tumor/metastases
– elderly patient
– history of malignancy
–  
systemic symptoms: weight loss, anorexia, fatigability
–  
worse pain when supine
–  
severe pain at night
● Axial spondylarthritis
– low back pain persisting for more than 12 weeks in a patient under 
age 45
–  
insidious onset of pain
– morning stiffness (≥ 30 minutes)
– improvement of low back pain with movement rather than at 
rest 
– awakening at night or early in the morning because of pain  
–  
alternating buttock pain
– progressive stiffness of the spine
–  
accompanying peripheral arthritis, enthesitis, uveitis
–  
concomitant psoriasis or inflammatory bowel disease 
Psychosocial risk factors for chronification (“yellow flags”) 
 
(selection) 
– depressive mood, distress (i.e., negative stress, mainly related to 
occupation or workplace) 
– pain-related cognitions: e.g., catastrophizing tendency, helpless-
ness/hopelessness, fear-avoidance beliefs
–  
passive pain behavior: e.g., markedly defensive and fearful/ 
avoidant behavior; excessively active pain behavior: task 
 
persistence, suppressive pain behavior
–  
pain-related cognitions: thought suppression
– somaticizing tendency

eTABLE 2 
Differences between multimodal pain therapy in the curative sector and multimodal treatment in the rehabilitative sector
Indications
Special considerati-
ons
Hospitalization
Multimodal pain therapy in the curative sector
– The requirements for indicated treatments with curative intent 
according to the current regulations in Germany [§27 (1) SGB V] 
must be met: the purpose of such treatment is “to detect or cure 
a disease, to prevent its worsening, or to alleviate its symptoms.”
– comprehensive diagnostic evaluation required
– rehabilitative capacity not present /not given
– comorbidities impeding effective treatment (e.g., severely limited 
cardiopulmonary reserve, poorly controlled metabolic diseases, 
neurological diseases, impaired mobility)
– continual worsening of pain over the past six months: spreading 
of the painful area, appearance of new kinds of pain, change in 
the character of pain, increase in the duration or frequency of 
painful attacks
–  
increased physical impairment or drug consumption
– inappropriate drug use
– difficulties encountered in the initiation or switching of drugs or in 
drug withdrawal
– increased need for interventional procedures
–  
need for more frequent and intensive treatment
– need for intensive medical supervision with daily rounds or team 
discussions 
– significant psychosocial factors or comorbid mental disorders 
that are relevant to pain 
–  
reimbursement as per the German Operations and Procedures 
Key (Operationen- und Prozedurenschlüssel, OPS), defined in 
consideration of patient features and structural and procedural 
quality 
–  
is part of few selective contracts
–  
intensive, bundled use of resources to achieve cure or stability 
for further outpatient care 
–  
partial or full hospitalization
Multimodal treament in the rehabilitative sector
– The requirements for indicated rehabilitative treatment according 
to current regulations in Germany [§ 11 (2) SGB V or § 15 SGB 
VI] must be met: the purpose of such treatment is “to prevent, 
eliminate, lessen, or compensate for disability or nursing depen-
dency, prevent its worsening, or alleviate its consequences.”
– rehabilitative capacity and motivation must be present
– limitation of daily activities and participation because of disease
– marked endangerment of capacity for employment
–  
already impaired capacity for employment
–  
imminent need for nursing care
– conse 
quences of disease that require treatment, and imminent 
or already existing physical impairment due to disease 
Criteria for inpatient rehabilitation in a facility far from the patient’s 
home: 
–  
longstanding ineffective treatment
–  
absence of local treatment facilities
– need to eliminate contextual stress factors, e.g., workplace-
 
related factors
– need for (or recognized claim upon) participatory measures that 
require inpatient treatment 
– medically / occupation–oriented rehabilitation 
–  
behavior-therapy-oriented rehabilitation
–  
on either an outpatient or an inpatient basis

Diagnosis and treatment of persistent low back pain (at 4 weeks)
Referral for further, specialized diagnostic evaluation and 
treatment, if necessary
Signs of a specific cause?  
Signs of a comorbid mental disorder?
Standardized assessment 
of psychosocial/workplace-related risk factors 
after 4 weeks of persistent pain
Multidisciplinary assessment to determine whether 
 
multimodal treatment is indicated
Rehabilitation
Multimodal pain therapy
Long-term management
Follow-up care
Consideration of pain intensity, functional impairment, 
 
comorbidities, and desire for treatment:
– reevaluation and intensification/supplementation of 
treatment 
– specialty consultation for treatment optimization, if 
 
necessary
– further observation under continued symptomatic 
 
baseline treatment, if necessary
– counseling on workplace-related problems and 
 
initiation of measures, if necessary

social/workplace-related risk factors? 
– Low back pain for more than 12 weeks?
Intensified treatment by general 
practitioner or orthopedist
