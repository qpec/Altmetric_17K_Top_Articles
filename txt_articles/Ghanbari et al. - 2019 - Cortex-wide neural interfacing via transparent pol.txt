Neural computations occurring simultaneously in multiple cerebral cortical regions are critical
for mediating behaviors. Progress has been made in understanding how neural activity in
specific cortical regions contributes to behavior. However, there is a lack of tools that allow
simultaneous monitoring and perturbing neural activity from multiple cortical regions. We
engineered ‘See-Shells’—digitally designed, morphologically realistic, transparent polymer
skulls that allow long-term (>300 days) optical access to 45 mm2 of the dorsal cerebral
cortex in the mouse. We demonstrate the ability to perform mesoscopic imaging, as well as
cellular and subcellular resolution two-photon imaging of neural structures up to 600 µm
deep. See-Shells allow calcium imaging from multiple, non-contiguous regions across the
cortex. Perforated See-Shells enable introducing penetrating neural probes to perturb or
record neural activity simultaneously with whole cortex imaging. See-Shells are constructed
using common desktop fabrication tools, providing a powerful tool for investigating brain
structure and function.

 T
he mammalian cerebral cortex mediates learned and
adaptive forms of sensory–motor behaviors and the evo-
lutionary expansion of the cortex underlies many advanced
cognitive capabilities in humans and non-human primates.
Neuroscientists have taken advantage of the modular organiza-
tion and segregation of the cortex into anatomically and func-
tionally distinct regions and have made enormous progress
understanding how computations performed in specific cortical
regions engage in behavior. However, operation of the brain
cannot be understood only by analysis of its components in
isolation. Yet, the mechanisms by which neural activity is coor-
dinated across the cerebral cortex to produce a unitary behavioral
output are not well understood. Even simple sensory or motor
tasks involve processing of information in multiple cortical
areas. For example, deflection of a single whisker results in
activation distributed across the sensorimotor cortices1, locomo-
tion modulates the neural responses in the primary visual cortex
with cell-type specificity2, and arousal exerts markedly different
effects across the cerebral cortex, both spatially and temporally3.
Further, such long-range information flow is dependent on the
internal brain state as well as information learned from past
experiences.
Understanding these large-scale computations requires the
ability to monitor and perturb neural activity across large regions
of the cortex. Until recently, the study of mesoscopic and mac-
roscopic brain networks has been limited to functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI) and magnetoencephalography (MEG).
However, fMRI and MEG are limited by their spatial and
temporal resolution. Two-photon (2P) imaging has rapidly
emerged as a tool of choice for in vivo imaging in rodent models
due to improved deep imaging over one-photon (1P) imaging
methods4. The development of optical sensing tools in recent
years allows 2P-based cellular resolution monitoring of neural
activities in local circuits. Genetically encoded Ca2+ indicators
(such as GCaMP6) have enabled in vivo high-resolution mon-
itoring of activities of hundreds to thousands of neurons5. The
development of red-shifted variants of Ca2+ indicators and
optogenetic tools open deep cortical regions for optical sensing
and perturbation6,7. The advent of streamlined strategies to
rapidly generate transgenic mice expressing optical reporters
has been matched by the recent development of wide-field 2P
imaging approaches8–10.
Deploying these new optical tools and instrumentation for
chronic imaging of large areas of the cerebral cortex requires
replacing the overlying opaque skull with a transparent substrate.
A widely used method to achieve chronic optical access to the
brain surface involves implanting optical windows or cranial
windows in which sections of the skull are excised and replaced
with glass coverslips11. To image even larger regions, strategies
for refractive index matching12 and thinned skull preparations13
have been used. These techniques, however, do not reliably allow
cellular resolution imaging as image quality is dependent on the
surgical preparation and is susceptible to bone regrowth over
time. Recently, curved glass windows and associated surgical
implantation methodology were introduced that allow chronic
optical access to the whole dorsal cortex for cellular resolution
imaging14. While each of these approaches has advanced the field,
each has limitations. Ideally, wide-field optical imaging would be
combined with modalities that allow simultaneous perturbation
of neural activities to reveal the effect of various brain regions on
global cortical activity. Further, combining wide-field optical
imaging with simultaneous electrophysiological recordings from
different brain regions will provide a better understanding of how
global activity patterns modulate activity in local circuits15.
Therefore, large optical windows with excellent optical properties,
long-term functionality, design flexibility, easy fabrication and
surgical implantation, and accommodation of other modalities
are needed.
Here we introduce See-Shells, digitally designed and morpholo-
gically realistic transparent polymer skulls that can be chronically
implanted for long durations (>300 days) and allow optical access
to 45 mm2 of the dorsal cerebral cortex. See-Shells can be custo-
mized to fit a variety of skull morphologies and allow for sub-
cellular resolution structural imaging. Further, Ca2+ imaging can be
performed at both mesoscale and cellular resolution from popula-
tions of neurons spread across millimeters of the cortex during
awake, head-fixed behavior. See-Shells are easily adapted to include
perforations for penetrating stimulation or recording probes. We
also demonstrate the ability to perform wide-field Ca2+ imaging
simultaneously with intracortical microstimulation and extra-
cellular recordings. See-Shells can be inexpensively fabricated
using desktop prototyping tools and can be implanted using
methodologies adapted from standard cranial window implan-
tation procedures.
Results
Device design and fabrication. The overall design of the See-
Shells is shown in Fig. 1a. A motorized stereotaxic instrument was
used to profile the skull surface covering the dorsal cortex of an 8-
week-old C57BL/6 mouse at 85 points (see Methods). These 85
coordinates provided a point cloud representation of the skull
surface used to interpolate a three-dimensional (3D) surface that
accurately mimicked the skull morphology (Supplementary
Figs. 1 and 2). Previous cranial morphometry studies of com-
monly used inbred laboratory mouse strains have shown that
intra-species variations in cranial bone shape and size are mini-
mal16. Further, postnatal size and shape of the skull are estab-
lished within the first 3 weeks and change minimally after
reaching adulthood17. Thus the interpolated surface from a single
mouse skull served as a template to digitally design generalized
transparent skulls (See-Shells) using computer-aided design
(CAD) software. The frame was 3D-printed out of poly-
methylmethacrylate (PMMA) onto which a thin, flexible and
transparent polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film was bonded
(Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 3). The 3D-printed frame also
incorporated screw holes for fastening a custom-designed tita-
nium head-plate for head-fixing the animal during experiments.
PET was chosen for the transparent element as this polymer has
excellent optical properties18 and is biocompatible19. The optical
properties of the PET film were compared to the current gold
standard, 170 µm thick glass coverslips (#1.5) used for a variety of
microscopic imaging experiments. Sub-diffraction limit 200 nm
fluorescent beads were imaged using a high magnification (×40)
objective through glass coverslip and PET film to construct the
lateral and axial point spread functions (PSFs, Fig. 1b, c). For beads
imaged through PET, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of
the lateral PSF (Fig. 1b) was 425 ± 26.2 nm (mean ± standard
deviation, n = 15) and was 409.3 ± 13.7 nm (n = 5) for beads
imaged through glass coverslip. No significant difference was
observed between PET and coverslip glass (Fig. 1d top, p = 0.35,
Welch’s t-test). For beads imaged through PET, the FWHM for the
axial PSF (Fig. 1c) was 2.88 ± 0.08 µm (n = 15) and was 3.01 ± 0.10
µm (n = 5) for beads imaged through glass coverslip. Again, no
significant difference was observed (Fig. 1d bottom, p = 0.34,
Welch’s t-test). Additional experiments characterized the light
transmittance of three PET samples using a widely tunable laser at
common wavelengths used for 2P imaging. All three PET samples
yielded light transmittance of >90% (Supplementary Table 1). On
average, across all wavelengths, light transmittance was 91.17 ±
0.94, 90.85 ± 1.1 and 91.71 ± 0.78% in the three samples tested,
compared to 92.79 ± 0.82% in a standard glass coverslip.

 Multi-photon and time-correlated single-photon counting
(TCSPC) based fluorescence-lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM)
of fluorescent yellow-green (YG) beads was performed to assess
whether the PET film introduces changes in light intensity or
fluorescence lifetime, respectively. While the present application
for See-Shells is fluorescence intensity measurements, FLIM has
an additional utility due its sensitivity to changes in the tissue
microenvironment and sample conditions without being affected
by changes in fluorophore concentration. Concerning light
intensity, 2P imaging of YG beads through the PET film required
1–2% higher gain settings on the photomultiplier tube (PMT)
compared to glass coverslips. This was expected, as PET film has a
slightly lower light transmission efficiency. Given that the
imaging was performed well within the PMT specifications, the
reduction in light transmission can be easily overcome by
increased laser power or PMT gain settings or a combination of
both. Next FLIM imaging was performed using the same 2P
instrument. Mean fluorescence lifetime of three PET film samples
were 2.13 ± 0.01, 2.16 ± 0.07, and 2.15 ± 0.02 ns (n = 3 measure-
ments in each substrate), comparable to the mean fluorescence
ifetime of #1.5 glass coverslips (2.15 ± 0.01 ns, n = 3 measure-
ments, Supplementary Fig. 4). The mean lifetimes are within
the resolution limit of this 2P-based FLIM system. Therefore,
PET has negligible effects on both 2P and FLIM imaging.
Chronic implantation of See-Shells. See-Shells were chronically
implanted on wild-type C57BL/6 (n = 9), Thy1-GCaMP6f (n =
31), Thy1-YFP mice (n = 3), and Thy1-GFPm mice (n = 3) after
a craniotomy was performed to remove the skull over the dorsal
cortex (Fig. 2a, see Methods). The median duration of the
implantation was 92 days, with durations ranging from 7 to
337 days. Of these, some procedures failed because the dental
cement used to seal the implants (see Methods) had not suffi-
ciently adhered to the skull. These experiments were terminated
within 10 days of surgery. Thus the overall surgery success rate
was 93.5% (3 surgeons, n = 43/46 mice). A subset of the mice was

 observed under a high magnification (×6) stereo-zoom micro-
scope after implantation to assess implant opacity or bone
regrowth. In 75% of the mice (n = 18/24), no opacity of the
windows or bone regrowth was observed in any part of the field of
view (FOV). In 3 mice, significant opacity (10–30% of the FOV)
was observed within 60 days. In 3 mice, opacity blocking optical
access to <10% of the FOV along the midline suture was observed
after >100 days of implantation, with 48 weeks being the longest
duration assessed.
As Thy1-GCaMP6f and Thy1-YFP mice are derived from
C57BL/6 lines, implants based on the surface profile from the
C57BL/6 mouse readily fit these transgenic mice. The digital
design methodology used to generate the See-Shells allows easy
modifications to fit skull morphologies different from commonly
used wild-type mouse strains. As an example, See-Shells were
custom designed for the tottering (tg/tg) mouse, a strain that has a
mutation in the Cacna1a gene20 and has a narrower skull than
C57BL/6 mice of the same age (Supplementary Fig. 2). Similar to
chronic implantations on C57BL/6 and derivative mouse strains,
the modified See-Shells on tg/tg mice (n = 5) remain optically
clear for up to 30 weeks (Fig. 2b).
In a subset of mice (n = 3), the inflammatory effect of chronic
implantation was assessed after 5 weeks of implantation by
immunostaining for expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein
(GFAP), a marker for chronic inflammation. No activated
astrocytes were observed in the cortex of the implanted and
control mice consistent with previous studies21. To assess
whether there is any increased expression of GFAP, the
fluorescent intensity was measured in multiple cortical areas
using the methodology described previously22. GFAP fluores-
cence intensity in arbitrary units (a.u.), in the areas assessed, was
15.26 ± 1.64 a.u. in the implanted mice. In comparison, GFAP
fluorescence intensity was 14.55 ± 1.99 a.u. in naive control
mice (n = 21 measurements from 3 mice each,Student's t-test,

mice for long durations of time and allow longitudinal imaging of
the dorsal cortex.
Sub-cellular resolution structural imaging across the cortex.
Chronically implanted cranial glass windows have been used for
high-resolution imaging of neural structure in vivo over extended
periods of time11. Several of these studies have revealed key cel-
lular
and
structural
mechanisms
underlying
experience-
dependent plasticity23–25. Therefore, we assessed the structural
imaging capability of See-Shells across the large FOV with spatial
resolution and imaging depths comparable with glass cranial
windows. See-Shells were implanted on Thy1-YFP mice (n = 3)
that express the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) in layer 2/3 and
layer 5 pyramidal neurons of the cortex26. Figure 3a, top left
shows a mesoscale image obtained using a wide-field epi-fluor-
escence microscope at ×1 magnification. Multiple locations dis-
tributed across the cortex of the same mouse were then imaged at
high-resolution with a 2P microscope. Whole cortical columns
(360 × 360 μm2) were reconstructed up to depths of 600 μm
(Fig. 3a, inset #1). Capturing multiple z-stacks from adjacent tiles
allowed reconstruction of large contiguous volumes of tissue
spread across millimeters of the cortex (Fig. 3a, inset #2 and #3).
At an optical zoom of ×4.4 using a ×25 objective, individual
neurons and their processes were imaged at depths of ~300 μm
from the pial surface (Fig. 3a, inset #4). At a zoom of ×7, finer
sub-cellular structures including dendrites and dendritic spines
were clearly visible (Fig. 3a, inset #5 and #6). In Thy1-GFPm
mice26, the same dendrites and dendritic spines can be imaged
across multiple days and imaged at multiple locations throughout

fine sub-cellular structures of neurons across the cerebral cortex.
Ca2+ imaging at multiple spatial scales across the cortex. To
assess the capabilities to monitor cortical neural activity, See-
Shells were implanted on Thy1-GCaMP6f mice that express the
Ca2+ indicator GCaMP6f in layer 2/3 and layer 5 pyramidal
neurons27. Wide-field imaging using a standard epi-fluorescence
microscope captured mesoscale activity across the entire FOV
(Supplementary Fig. 5, Supplementary Movie 1). Robust activa-
tion of the entire cortex was observed during locomotion, with
spontaneous activity observed even at rest. In the mouse shown in
Fig. 4a, four random areas highlighted by the colored blocks were
targeted for 2P imaging. At each area, z-stacks of 365 × 365 μm2
were captured when the mouse was fully awake and head-fixed on
a custom-built disk treadmill (Fig. 4b). Two-dimensional (2D)
maximum intensity projections of the z-stacks revealed macro-
scopic anatomical features such as blood vessels that could be
matched with wide-field images to determine the imaging loca-
tions post hoc. In each tile, time series of Ca2+ activity were
acquired in planes at 200–300 µm from the pial surface.
Individual cells were readily visualized in the average intensity
projections of the time series (Fig. 4c). Spontaneous Ca2+ activity
traces from a small subset of the detected neurons in each tile
during awake head-fixation are shown in Fig. 4d.
To evaluate See-Shells’ capability to monitor Ca2+ signals in
the same neurons over time, multiple imaging sessions were
performed in the same FOV over a month starting 44 weeks after
implantation on a Thy1-GCaMP6f mouse (Fig. 4e). Average
intensity projections from a set of high-resolution images
qualitatively indicated that the same neurons could be identified
over time. Robust Ca2+ signals were obtained with the peak ΔF/F
of randomly selected individual neurons ranging between 128.7 to
240.4% across all imaging sessions. Linear regression analysis of
peak ΔF/F measured over imaging sessions indicated that Ca2+
signals were diminished slightly across duration evaluated (R2 =
0.378, average slope of trend-line = −1.23% per day, n = 5
neurons, Supplementary Fig. 6). Further, 2P imaging was
performed at multiple sites distributed across the cortex in a
late-stage implanted mouse (Day 335, Supplementary Fig. 7).
Similar to the data shown in Fig. 4, robust Ca2+ signals were
acquired from each region with peak ΔF/F of individual neurons
ranging between 61.51 to 191.84%.

 Further, Ca2+ activities were tracked in Thy1-GCaMP6f mice
using 2P imaging in the hindlimb area of the primary motor
cortex along with high-speed video monitoring. Mice implanted
with See-Shells readily performed a variety of behaviors including
walking and grooming during head-fixation. In the recording
highlighted in Supplementary Movie 2, increased Ca2+ activity
occurred during walking as tracked by movements of the
hindlimb, forelimb, and disk treadmill but the modulation was
absent during grooming, indicated by forelimb movement
(Supplementary Fig. 8).
Thus See-Shells allow multi-scale imaging over long durations
in the mouse cerebral cortex during a wide range of head-fixed
behaviors. The capability to image in the same animal structurally
at subcellular resolution as well as Ca2+ activity at the cell and
mesoscale level will provide new insights between factors, such as
physical structure and neural state.
Multi-modal and bidirectional neural interfacing. Another
advantage of the See-Shell design and PET film is incorporation
of
additional
modalities
to
record
and/or
perturb
neural
structures. For example, combining wide-field Ca2+ activity
monitoring while simultaneously recording neural firing from
localized circuits will enable determination of how global cortical
activity relates to local circuit activity15. See-Shells were engi-
neered with a ~1.5 mm perforation over the primary somato-
sensory cortex to introduce a 32-channel, silicon-based recording
probe (Fig. 5a). The perforations were made prior to implantation
and sealed with quick setting silicone sealant that could be
removed during experiments (n = 3 Thy1-GCaMP6f, Fig. 5b).
Mesoscale Ca2+ imaging was performed simultaneously with
the single cell recordings in left primary somatosensory cortex and
high-speed behavioral recording during awake head-fixation
(Fig. 5c). Ca2+ activity from six regions of interest (ROIs) in the
bilateral motor (M1), somatosensory (S1), and visual cortices (V1)
show robust co-activation of multiple homotopic regions. Single-
cell electrophysiology recordings revealed a subset of neurons
with increased firing rates correlated with mesoscale Ca2+ activity
in the ipsilateral primary somatosensory cortex (I-S1) (Fig. 5c, d).
To assess the relation between the Ca2+ activity and activity of
individual neurons, the Ca2+ signal in I-S1 was cross-correlated
with the spike firing rate of each recorded neuron and compared

firing rate correlated with the Ca2+ signals in I-S1 (cell 9) and one

of
the
shuffled
traces).
These
experiments suggest that activities of individual neurons are
diverse in terms of their correlation with mesoscale activity. See-
Shells thus allow us to observe cortical activity at multiple scales
and understand their significance to behavior.
Finally,
we
demonstrate
that
perforations
in
See-Shells
introduced after chronic implantation can be used to perturb
neural circuits with intracortical microstimulation, which has been
widely used to assess cortical connectivity and function including
effects on downstream targets. In a subset of Thy1-GCaMP6f mice
(n = 3, Fig. 6a), the PET film was carefully punctured with a sterile
syringe needle to introduce microstimulation electrodes. Stimula-
tion resulted in robust activation of both hemispheres in the awake
and anesthetized states (Fig. 6b, c) with significantly prolonged
responses in the anesthetized mouse compared to responses in
the mouse when awake. Traces shown in Fig. 6c represent the
average trace of ≥10 trials for the awake state, and ≥4 trials for
anesthetized state in each mouse (Mouse #1: 10 awake, 5
anesthetized, Mouse #2: 15 awake, 6 anesthetized, and Mouse #3:
11 awake, 4 anesthetized). The FWHM of the post-stimulus Ca2+
fluorescence response was significantly longer in all ROIs
examined during isoflurane anesthesia (Fig. 6d, Student's t-test,
p < 0.001). These results with See-Shells in the awake animal
extend previous flavoprotein imaging observations in anesthe-
tized mice showing that microstimulation of the primary motor
cortex co-activates homotopic regions via the corpus callosum29.
Therefore, See-Shells can be used to study the effects of
perturbing localized regions and suggest that the arousal state
alters cortical dynamics. While the present study employed
intracortical microstimulation, the methodology could be easily
compatible with optogenetic or chemical stimulation of cortical
or sub-cortical brain regions.
Discussion
We developed See-Shells, transparent, morphologically con-
formant polymer skulls that allow optical access to a large part of
the dorsal cerebral cortex for high-resolution structural and
functional imaging. These windows can be implanted for long
periods and remain functional for over 300 days. In line with
estimates from recent studies using curved glass windows14, See-
Shells provide optical access to ~1 million neurons from the
cortical surface. In addition, optical imaging with See-Shells can
be combined with other modalities. Perforation of the PET film
allows access to the brain underneath the implant and here we
demonstrated wide-field Ca2+ imaging with simultaneous intra-
cortical microstimulation and electrophysiological recordings.
The optical properties of PET compare favorably with glass
coverslips when evaluated by 2P or FLIM imaging. The latter
opens up the possibility for FLIM intra-vital brain imaging of
auto-fluorescence using PET windows30,31. For example, the

 intrinsically fluorescent metabolites nicotinamide adenine dinu-
cleotide hydrogen and flavin adenine dinucleotide are widely used
in vivo to record label-free cellular activity based on their oxi-
dation state32–34. Changes in the lifetime of both coenzymes are
used to monitor the biological microenvironment32, including in
intra-vital studies35. Thus, while the current goal is to use PET to
realize transparent skulls for cortex-wide imaging, the flexibility,
optical clarity, and biocompatibility demonstrate the feasibility of
engineering anatomically realistic windows for intra-vital imaging
in a wide variety of organs, such as mammary gland36 and lung37.
See-Shells can be implanted using simple modifications to well-
established chronic cranial window implantation procedures38,39,
with the major change being the removal of large sections of the
skull above the dorsal cerebral cortex. In this study, we utilized a
robot that uses surface profiling to guide a computer numerical
controlled (CNC) mill to perform the craniotomy40. Automation
enabled reliable removal of the bone without damage to the
underlying dura and brain and also allowed precise positioning of
the implant relative to bregma. We also performed manual cra-
niotomies for See-Shells implantations on tg/tg mice, demon-
strating that automation of the craniotomy is not a pre-requisite
for successful implantation, although it could help investigators
quickly adapt these tools for their research.
High-quality mesoscopic Ca2+ imaging in the awake animal
has been performed in mice implanted with See-Shells for
48 weeks, the longest period tested to date. Chronic imaging over
this duration provides the opportunity for very long-term studies
of brain development, plasticity and learning, disease processes,
and evaluation of new therapies. For developmental studies, the
primary limitation will be skull growth in the postnatal period.
Mouse skull sutures that fuse do so by ~45 days of age, and most
cranial expansion is complete by 6 weeks17,41. However, the
majority of skull growth is complete earlier (~2–3 weeks of age),
suggesting that the windows could be implanted in younger
animals.
Several aspects of the design and fabrication of the See-Shells
are widely adoptable and highly flexible. See-Shells can be fabri-
cated using desktop tools and are inexpensive (<$20 each). Once
the individual components are fabricated (or procured from
commercial fabrication services), the implant can be assembled in
<15 min. Therefore, this is a tool that can be readily adopted by
most laboratories. Although the cranial implants were developed
for the dorsal cerebral cortex with its fairly regular convex surface,
the design can be modified for a variety of skull morphologies.
Future versions can be designed to cover not only the dorsal
cerebral cortex but also other regions including the olfactory bulb,
cerebellum, and more lateral cortical regions such as the auditory
cortex.
See-Shells could also be engineered for optical interfacing with
complex and mobile anatomical structures such as the spine. The
3D-printed frame can be modified to incorporate mounting fea-
tures to precisely attach miniaturized microscopes42 and wire-
lessly controlled devices for infusing pharmacological agents or
performing
optogenetic
stimulations43.
Recently,
ultra-
miniaturized lens-less fluorescence microscopes <1 mm in size
have been developed44. Engineering See-Shells embedded with
these miniaturized lens-less imaging systems offers the possibility
of monitoring the activity of the whole cortex during freely
moving behaviors.
The ability to simultaneously monitor local microcircuit
activity using extracellular recordings combined with wide-field
Ca2+ imaging offers the potential to integrate the contribution of
local microcircuits to mesoscale activities. We show that both
mesoscale and single unit activities correlated with motor activity.
Additional information about the cortical state is likely repre-
sented in the complex spatio-temporal patterns of activity
observed with mesoscale imaging. See-Shells would allow sys-
tematic multi-scale studies tying activity at microcircuits to large
scale network activity. Using See-Shells to combine wide-field Ca2+
imaging with in vivo patch clamping methodologies to record
from single45 and multiple neurons46 will help us to better
understand how mesoscale network activity influences sub-
threshold membrane potential dynamics in individual neurons.
We have used perforated See-Shells to perform intracortical
microstimulation. In addition to stimulating electrodes, this
methodology can be used to introduce probes for optogenetic or
chemical perturbation of cortical and sub-cortical brain regions.
These perturbation strategies will be particularly useful to study
how activation or inhibition of localized brain regions or circuits
affect global cerebral cortical activity. This includes both specific
pathways such as the cerebello-thalamo-cortical47,48 and basal
ganglia-thalamo-cortical projections49,50 or the more diffuse
neuromodulatory projections such as noradrenergic inputs from
the brain stem51,52 or cholinergic inputs from the basal
forebrain53.
With their similar genetics, anatomy, physiology, and beha-
vioral repertoire, non-human primates (NHPs) provide the clo-
sest animal model to humans for understanding both normal
functions as well as disease54–56. Emerging genetic modification
techniques, including CRISPR, make generating transgenic NHPs
with broad expression of Ca2+ reporters a possibility57. Further,
techniques for long-term 2P imaging in NHPs are also emer-
ging58. The See-Shells methodology can be adapted to build
customized implants derived from computed-tomographic (CT)
scans of the skull, enabling imaging of neural activities across
centimeters of the NHP cortex.
While the See-Shells allow sub-cellular resolution imaging
across the cortex, imaging across the whole FOV simultaneously
at high resolution is currently not possible. Recently developed
wide-field 2P imaging systems8–10 allow simultaneous imaging of
nearly an entire hemisphere. Extending such optical systems to
simultaneously image the whole dorsal cortex at cellular resolu-
tion would be very powerful. We have performed mesoscale
imaging while simultaneously inserting neural probes for extra-
cellular recordings and microstimulation. It is difficult to do such
experiments with 2P microscopes, given the short working dis-
tance of high NA and high-magnification objectives. In the future,
it may be possible to perform random access 2P imaging across
the whole FOV using customized long working distance high-
resolution objectives or by using optical relays between the PET
surface and the objectives to allow more room for the introduc-
tion of recording probes59. Neural probes that are specifically
designed to be compatible with 2P imaging could also be engi-
neered, or flexible neural probes that can be reconfigured after
implantation
to
provide
unimpeded
optical
access
could
be used60,61.
Methods
See-Shell design and fabrication. All of the animal studies were approved by and
conducted in conformity with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of
the University of Minnesota. An adult C57BL/6 male mouse (8 weeks, #000664,
Jackson Laboratories) and a tg/tg male mouse (16 weeks) were used for skull
surface profiling. In each experiment, the mouse was anesthetized using isoflurane
in oxygen (4–5% induction, 0.8–1.5% maintenance). The scalp was shaved and
sterilized using standard aseptic procedures, after which the mouse was head-fixed
in a stereotaxic instrument (David Kopf Instruments Inc.) which was modified to
have CNC milling capabilities by incorporating a programmatically controlled
three-axis motorized manipulator (MTS25-Z8, Thorlabs)40. A handheld mill
(Rampower, Ram Products Inc.) fitted with a 200-μm diameter end mill (Harvey
tools Inc.) was mounted on the three-axis manipulator using a custom adaptor
plate. A custom computer program was written in LabVIEW (National Instru-
ments Inc.) to control the position of the manipulator.
The scalp covering the dorsal skull surface was excised and fascia removed using
a micro-curette to prepare the skull for surface profiling. The end mill mounted on
a motorized stage was carefully lowered until the end mill tip made contact with

 the skull surface at bregma. This process was visualized at the highest magnification
setting of the stereo-zoom microscope (×6, M60, Leica) to ensure that the tip did
not exert a force large enough to deform the skull surface before registering the
coordinates in the LabVIEW program. This served as the origin of a Cartesian
coordinate system. The LabVIEW program then raised the end mill 0.5 mm above
bregma and moved it laterally to the first profiling point (Supplementary Figs. 1a
and 2a). The end mill was carefully lowered until it made contact with the skull
surface and the z-coordinate was registered. The program then raised the end mill
by 0.5 mm and moved it laterally to the next profiling point. The process of
registering the z-coordinate was repeated at 85 profiling points on the dorsal skull
surface of the C57BL/6 mouse and 134 points on the tg/tg mouse. These data were
used to construct 3D point clouds to define the skull surfaces (Supplementary
Figs. 1b and 2b).
The point cloud was imported into a CAD software (Solidworks, Dassault
Systèmes). Points along the medial–lateral direction were used to define 3D curves
and to interpolate a 3D surface mimicking the skull surface (Supplementary
Figs. 1c and 2c). This 3D surface was then extruded to 0.6–0.8 mm thickness to
create a solid surface, which was then used as a template for defining the structural
frame of the See-Shell (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Figs. 1d and 2d). The CAD files used
for 3D printing of the frame are available for download (Supplementary Data 1).
See-Shells were fabricated in a multistep process illustrated in detail in
Supplementary Fig. 3. First, the See-Shell structural frame and two molds to assist
with bonding the PET to the See-Shell frame were 3D-printed out of PMMA (RS-
F2-GPBK-04, RS-F2-GPCL-04, Formlabs Inc.) using a desktop stereolithography
(SLA) printer (Form 2, Formlabs Inc., Supplementary Fig. 3a, b). The three holes in
the frame were tapped using a 0–80 hand tap (# 15J611, Grainger). A desktop laser
jet printer (HP210w, Hewlett Packard Inc.) was used to print an outline matching
the See-Shell frame on a 50 µm thick PET film (MELINEX 462, Dupont Inc.). The
PET film was cleaned using ethanol and low-lint cleaning tissue (KimWipes,
Kimtech Inc.). A pair of scissors was used to cut the PET film using the printed
outline as a reference. This PET film was then aligned to the PMMA frame and
bonded using a clear, two-part quick setting epoxy adhesive (Scotch-Weld™ DP100
Plus Clear, 3 M Inc.) (Supplementary Fig. 3c–f). A head-plate was fabricated from a
0.016 inch sheet of titanium using a water jet cutter (Omax Inc., see Supplementary
Data 1 for CAD drawing). The titanium head-plate was designed such that a ×25
objective, with 3 mm long working distance could access the whole FOV provided
by the See-Shells while also providing adequate mechanical support for the head-
fixed experiments.
PET optical characterization. An inverted 2P laser scanning microscope was used
to image 200 nm YG beads (Polysciences Inc., Warrington, PA, cat#18142-2) using
a ×40 magnification, 1.15 numerical aperture (NA) objective (Nikon Apo LWD)
through three PET film samples and compared to imaging through a #1.5 glass
bottom dish. A Gaussian curve was fit using a standard curve fitting toolbox
(MATLAB, Mathworks Inc.). The Gaussian profile was used to estimate the PSFs as
illustrated in Fig. 1b, c. YG beads were imaged at 500 sections over 13 µm along the
z-axis to construct the axial PSF (Fig. 1c). In these characterizations, identical gain
settings and analyses were used for the PET and glass coverslip measurements.
Time domain FLIM was performed using TCSPC with Becker and Hickl SPC-
150 board to determine the fluorescent lifetime of YG beads imaged through PET.
An 80 MHz Ti:Sapphire laser (Spectra Physics; Maitai) tuned to the wavelength of
890 nm was used as the excitation source. The excitation and emission were
coupled through an inverted microscope (Nikon; Eclipse TE300) with a ×20 air
immersion objective (Nikon, Plan Fluor, N.A. 0.75). A 520/30 nm band-pass
emission filter (Semrock, Rochester NY) was also used to selectively collect YG
beads fluorescence. FLIM images were collected at 256 × 256 pixel resolution with
30 s acquisition using SPC-830 Photon Counting Electronics (Becker & Hickl
GbmH, Berlin, Germany) and Hamamatsu H742MP-40 GaAsP photomultiplier
tube (Hamamatsu Photonics, Bridgewater, NJ). To compare light intensity
attenuation of PET with glass, the laser power was kept at a fixed value using the
calibrated power control on a custom-built 2P microscope and the gain on the
PMT was recorded to reach saturation. Urea crystals were used to determine the
Instrumentation Response Function with a 445/20 bandpass emission filter
(Semrock, Rochester, NY). SPCImage software (Becker & Hickl GbmH, Berlin,
Germany) was used to analyze the fluorescence-lifetime decay curves. The lifetime
decay of each pixel was fit with a single exponential decay that resulted in a χ2 error
of 1.05 ± 0.12 (n = 3). Image analyses to estimate FWHM of fluorescent intensities
were performed in Fiji62.
In vivo surgical implantation. The procedure for implantation of the See-Shells was
adapted from previously reported chronic glass window implantation protocols39.
Mice were anesthetized using 1–3% isoflurane in pure oxygen (0.6 mL min−1). The
scalp was shaved and cleaned using standard aseptic surgical procedures. Eyes were
covered with ophthalmic eye ointment (Puralube, Dechra Veterinary Products).
Buprenorphine (0.1 mg kg−1) and Meloxicam (1–2 mg kg−1) were administered
subcutaneously for analgesia and managing inflammation, respectively. Mice were
then head-fixed using ear bars and a nose cone in the stereotaxic instrument
equipped with the CNC milling machine. A feedback regulated heating pad was
used to maintain the body temperature at 37 °C throughout the procedure.
Anesthetic depth was assessed every 15 min via toe pinch stimulus and anesthesia
dosage adjusted as needed. Warm lactated Ringer’s solution was administered
subcutaneously every 2 h to prevent dehydration. A local anesthetic (1% Lidocaine)
was administered subcutaneously at the incision sites. The scalp was then removed
to expose the skull covering the dorsal and cerebellar cortices. A micro curette was
used to scrape the skull surface to remove fascia.
The CNC milling machine40 incorporated in the stereotaxic instrument was
used to perform automated craniotomies on C57BL/6, Thy1-YFP (#003709,
Jackson Laboratories), Thy1-GFPm (#007788, Jackson Laboratories), and Thy1-
GCaMP6f mice (#024276, Jackson Laboratories) (Supplementary Fig. 1a). Briefly,
the CNC end mill was lowered to the skull surface at pilot points along a predefined
path slightly smaller than the perimeter of the See-Shell. Once the contact was
confirmed visually through a stereomicroscope, the z-coordinate at that point was
registered. This process was repeated at multiple points along the desired
craniotomy path. The registered coordinates were then used to interpolate a 3D
cutting path for milling the skull in the LabVIEW program. For each craniotomy,
the initial milling depth was 50 µm, which was well within the thickness of the
skull. In each subsequent milling pass, the depth was incremented in 10 µm steps
until reaching the soft part of the bone or trabeculae in a section of the craniotomy
path. This was sufficient to pry open the bone for excision across the whole
craniotomy. Of the surgeries assessed, the milling was stopped at depths of
107.85 ± 16.79 µm in C57BL/6 (n = 7 mice), 57.14 ± 16.25 µm in Thy1-GCaMP6f
(n = 14 mice), and 70 µm in three Thy1-YFP mice. Craniotomies in tg/tg mice were
performed manually.
Prior to removing the milled skull, one or two self-tapping screws (F000CE094,
Morris Precision Screws and Parts) were implanted 2–3 mm posterior and 3 mm
mediolateral to lambda to assist in anchoring the See-Shell to the skull. The skull
was removed using surgical forceps taking care to ensure the dura was intact over
the entire exposed brain. The brain was covered with sterilized surgical gauze pad
soaked in 0.9% saline. The See-Shell was sterilized by soaking in 70% ethanol for
2–3 min followed by rinsing in sterile saline. The gauze pad was removed and the
See-Shell was gently placed on top of the exposed brain and aligned to the
craniotomy (Supplementary Fig. 3g). The edge of the See-Shell was attached to the
skull around the craniotomy by applying a few drops of cyanoacrylate glue
(VetBond, 3 M Inc.) using a 29-gauge syringe needle. Dental cement (S380, C&B
Metabond, Parkell Inc.) was applied to the periphery of the See-Shell to cement it
to the skull surface. Care was taken to ensure the screw holes for fastening the
titanium head-plates were not filled in with the uncured dental cement. The dental
cement was allowed to fully cure. The titanium head-plate was attached to the
frame using 3/32 inch flat head 0–80 screws on the day of implantation. This was
followed by a second round of dental cement application to ensure that three
fastening locations were fully enclosed in the cement to make it a structurally rigid
implant. To protect the implant and underlying brain from light and physical
impacts, an opaque 3D-printed PMMA cap was fastened to the titanium head-plate
using 3/16 inch flat head 0–80 screws.
In a subset of Thy1-GCaMP6f mice implanted (n = 3), the See-Shells had
~1.5 mm diameter perforations above the primary somatosensory cortex (centered
−0.76 mm, −2.47 mm AL to bregma). The perforation was sealed using quick
setting silicone sealant (KWIK-SIL, World Precision Instruments) on the day of the
surgery. The brain could be accessed in multiple experimental sessions across
weeks by removing and replacing the silicone seal.
After implantation, mice were allowed to recover on a heating pad until
ambulatory and then returned to a clean home cage. All mice were administered
Buprenorphine and Meloxicam post-operatively on the day of the surgery as well as
the 3 succeeding days to assist with full recovery.
2P imaging. All mice were allowed to recover from surgery for ≥7 days before
imaging experiments were attempted. A 2P microscope (Leica SP5II) with a ×25
(0.95 NA) water immersion objective was used for high-resolution imaging
experiments in vivo. A Mai: Tai Deepsee (Spectra-Physics) laser was tuned to 940
nm wavelength for excitation. Mice were head-fixed under the 2P microscope in a
custom-designed disk treadmill (Fig. 4b). Locations in the FOV were targeted at
random locations as illustrated in Figs. 3a and 4a.
For structural imaging in Thy1-YFP mice, each z-stack had a FOV of 365 ×
365 μm2 (512 × 512 pixels), starting ~100 μm above the top surface of the PET film,
with images acquired every 2 μm down to 800 μm below the starting plane. In two
instances, z-stacks were acquired from 5 adjacent tiles by moving the objective in
the medial–lateral direction by 340 µm such that one edge has an overlap of 25 µm.
Ca2+ imaging was performed in Thy1-GCaMP6f using the same head-fixation
set-up in fully awake mice. Z-stacks were acquired every 10 µm from adjacent
365 × 365 µm2 tiles with a 15 µm overlap along one edge. Maximum intensity
projects of these z-stacks were constructed and macroscopic feature in these
projects were used to determine their coordinates in the corresponding wide-field
epifluorescence image. Time series were acquired at 20 Hz (256 × 256 pixels) for
5 min at one plane in each tile at depths ranging between 200 and 300 µm.
Intracortical microstimulation during wide-field imaging. Mice were head-fixed
in the custom-designed disk treadmill placed under a stereo-zoom microscope
under light (0.5–1%) isoflurane anesthesia. A feedback regulated heating pad was
used to regulate the body temperature at 37 °C. The PET film was carefully per-

 of an intracortical stimulation electrode. The treadmill was then placed under an
epifluorescence microscope (QUANTEM: 5125 C, Nikon). A 250-µm diameter
tungsten micro-electrode (Lot # 217037, FHC) was introduced into the brain at an
angle of 45° (anterior–posterior direction) using a micromanipulator. Imaging was
performed using a ×1 objective when the animal was anesthetized (0.5–1% iso-
flurane). Each trial lasted a total duration of 2 min sampled at 20 Hz using
Metamorph (Molecular Devices Inc.). Stimulation train of 20 pulses (200 µA at
100 Hz) was delivered to the primary motor cortex ~5 s after initiation of each trial.
Anesthesia was turned off and mouse was allowed to recover for 1 h before
recording during awake state. Behavior was recorded during awake trials using a
high-speed camera (FL3-U3-13Y3M-C, FLIR Inc.) at 20 frames per second to
monitor whisker or limb movements. At the end of the experiment, the perfora-
tions were covered with silicone sealant and the animals were returned to the
home cage.
Simultaneous extracellular recordings and wide-field imaging. Simultaneous
extracellular recording and wide-field imaging were performed on Thy1-GCaMP6f
mice that had perforations created in the See-Shells prior to implantation. The
implants were fully assembled and the PET film perforated by gently touching the
film with a hot solder iron tip at 550–600 °F. This resulted in ~1.5 mm diameter
perforation over the primary somatosensory cortex. On the day of the experiment,
mice were head-fixed in a custom treadmill under a stereo-zoom microscope under
light (0.5–1%) isoflurane anesthesia. The silicone seal covering the perforation was
carefully removed and the treadmill was placed under the epifluorescence micro-
scope. A 32-channel probe (Neuronexus, A1x32-Edge-5mm-100-177-A32) was
mounted on a motorized stage (MPC 385, Sutter Instruments Inc.) and guided to
the center of the perforation to touch the dura at ~2.47 mm lateral and ~0.76 mm
caudal from bregma. Then the See-Shell was covered with a conductive gel bath of
1% agarose and the ground electrode was placed in a corner of the gel bath. The
recording probe was inserted into the brain in 10 µm steps up to a depth of 1 mm
from the pial surface into the cortex using a high precision DC motor (MTS25-Z8,
Thorlabs) mounted on the Sutter manipulator at a 45° entry angle.
Recordings from the neural probe were first pre-amplified (RA16PA Medusa
PreAmps, Tucker Davis Technologies), then transmitted to a second amplifier and
digitizer (RZ2 system, Tucker Davis Technologies). Neural data was sampled at
24 kHz and band passed at 700-5000 Hz to visualize extracellular single units or
between 0 and 200 Hz to visualize local field potentials. Simultaneous mesoscale
optical imaging was performed at 10 Hz. Behavior was recorded during awake trials
using a high-speed camera (FL3-U3-13Y3M-C, FLIR Inc.) at 20 frames per second.
At the end of the experiment, the perforation was covered with the silicone sealant.
Data analyses. For wide-field 1P imaging data analyses, six ROIs covering the
bilateral motor, somatosensory, and visual cortices were defined. Data analyses
were performed in Fiji. Average fluorescent intensity was measured for each ROI in
each image. A custom MATLAB script was used to calculate the normalized change
in fluorescent intensity over the time series of images. Baseline average fluorescence
was obtained by averaging fluorescent intensity over the first 4 s of the time series.
After normalization, the time series were filtered (2-pole Butterworth low-pass
filter: 0.3 Hz)63.
2P Ca2+ imaging data were analyzed with Fiji and MATLAB. Briefly, for each
time series, the moco (Motion Correction) plugin64 in Fiji was used to correct for
motion artifacts. Maximum intensity and standard deviation images were used to
identify cells and place ROIs over each cell in the FOV. For each ROI, the average
of the pixel intensity was extracted and imported into a custom MATLAB code.
Differential fluorescence intensity (ΔF/F0) was calculated for each ROI, where F0
was equal to the lowest 20% of the average pixel value in the ROI over the complete
time series.
Behavioral image sequences were imported and analyzed in Fiji. Each image
sequence was binned at 3 × 3. ROIs were placed over the nose, forelimb, hindlimb,
and the disk. Changes in average pixel intensity across the ROIs in sequential
frames when there was movement detected or when there was no movement
detected were given a value of 1 or 0, respectively. This allowed for various types of
behavior to be quantified. Walking was classified as changes in all ROIs; grooming
was classified as changes in only the forepaw and nose ROIs.
All extracellular recording data were post-processed using custom MATLAB
scripts. The raw voltage traces from multiple channels were filtered using a 150th
order finite impulse response filter with bounds of 800–5000 Hz. The filtered
signals were thresholded to detect action potentials using previously described
methods65. Cells were sorted using linear discriminant analyses and wavelet
decomposition65–67. Firing rate for each cell was computed using kernel density
estimation and smoothing68. To determine the relationship between Ca2+ signals
and firing rates, we generated 1000 bootstrapped shuffled trials of the spike firing
rate of each cell65 and computed the cross-correlations with the Ca2+ activity in
I-S1. The cells were categorize as modulated if their correlation coefficient at zero-
lag was greater than mean + 1.96 times the standard deviation of the bootstrapped
trials.
Histology. A subset of mice (n = 3 control mice and n = 3 mice implanted with
See-Shells for 5 weeks) were fully anesthetized in 5% isoflurane and transcardially
perfused with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; CAT# P5493-1L, Sigma Aldrich)
followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA; CAT# P6148-500G, Sigma Aldrich). The
brains were extracted and stored overnight in 4% PFA for fixation. The brain was
sliced into 50 µm slices and then kept in PBS solution containing 100 mM glycine
(50046-50 G, Sigma Aldrich) for 30 min to quench excess PFA. This was followed
by keeping the slices in PBS solution containing 100 mM glycine and 2% Triton
X-100 (93443-100 ML, Sigma Aldrich) to permeabilize the tissue. Slices were then
kept in PBS solution containing Triton X-100 and blocking agent (Goat Serum,
CAT# 927502, Biolegend) for 2 h after which they were incubated in the solution
containing 1:1500 primary antibody–Monoclonal Anti-GFAP antibody produced
in mouse (G3893-.2 ML, Sigma Aldrich) for 24 h at 4 °C. Slices were washed and
incubated in solution containing the secondary antibody conjugated with fluor-
ophores (anti-mouse Alexa 488, ab150117, abcam). Next, the slices were thor-
oughly washed to clear any excess antibody and mounted on glass slides in
VECTASHEILD (H-1200, Vector Labs), a mounting medium containing 4′,6-
diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Mounted slices were imaged under an upright
confocal microscope (FV1000 BX2, Olympus FluoView). GFAP expression was
quantified using a previously established protocol22. In each slice, average fluor-
escent intensity was measured using the “measure” function in Fiji at 7 ROIs
(500 × 500 µm2) distributed in the image, with 4 ROIs at the pial surface and 3
ROIs in layer 2/3. This analysis was repeated in slices from three implanted and
three non-surgical control mice.
