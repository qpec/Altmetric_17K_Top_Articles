ABSTRACT
Objective
To identify the genetic determinants of fracture risk 
and assess the role of 15 clinical risk factors on 
osteoporotic fracture risk.
DeSiGN
Meta-analysis of genome wide association studies 
(GWAS) and a two-sample mendelian randomisation 
approach.
SettiNG
25 cohorts from Europe, United States, east Asia, and 
Australia with genome wide genotyping and fracture 
data.
ParticiPaNtS
A discovery set of 37 857 fracture cases and 227 116 
controls; with replication in up to 147 200 fracture 
cases and 150 085 controls. Fracture cases were 
defined as individuals (>18 years old) who had 
fractures at any skeletal site confirmed by medical, 
radiological, or questionnaire reports. Instrumental 
variable analyses were performed to estimate effects 
of 15 selected clinical risk factors for fracture in a two-
sample mendelian randomisation framework, using 
the largest previously published GWAS meta-analysis 
of each risk factor.
reSultS
Of 15 fracture associated loci identified, all were also 
associated with bone mineral density and mapped to 
genes clustering in pathways known to be critical to 
bone biology (eg, SOST, WNT16, and ESR1) or novel 
pathways (FAM210A, GRB10, and ETS2). Mendelian 
randomisation analyses showed a clear effect of 
bone mineral density on fracture risk. One standard 
deviation decrease in genetically determined bone 
mineral density of the femoral neck was associated 
with a 55% increase in fracture risk (odds ratio 1.55 
(95% confidence interval 1.48 to 1.63; P=1.5×10−68). 
Hand grip strength was inversely associated with 
fracture risk, but this result was not significant after 
multiple testing correction. The remaining clinical 
risk factors (including vitamin D levels) showed no 
evidence for an effect on fracture.
cONcluSiONS
This large scale GWAS meta-analysis for fracture 
identified 15 genetic determinants of fracture, all of 
which also influenced bone mineral density. Among 
the clinical risk factors for fracture assessed, only 
bone mineral density showed a major causal effect 
on fracture. Genetic predisposition to lower levels of 
vitamin D and estimated calcium intake from dairy 
sources were not associated with fracture risk.
Introduction
The United Nations recently predicted that the ratio 
of people aged 65 years and older to those aged 15-
64 years will triple globally by 2100.1 Musculoskeletal 
conditions are the most common causes of severe 
pain and physical disability, and their prevalence 
will increase with the ageing of society.2 One of the 
largest musculoskeletal burdens is attributable to 
osteoporotic fractures, the incidence of which increases 
exponentially with age.3 Therefore, the prevention of 
fractures is an important public health goal.
The causes of multifactorial common diseases, 
such as osteoporotic fractures, include genetic and 
environmental influences, as well as their interactions 
(gene by environment, or G×E). Clinically useful risk 
factors for the prediction of osteoporotic fracture 
risk need not be necessarily causal and have been 
implemented by well validated risk score algorithms 
such as FRAX4 and the Garvan5 6 fracture risk 
calculator. Yet, the extent to which modification of 
predictive clinical risk factors reduces fracture risk 
is not generally known. A better understanding of 
causal mechanisms will enable prevention strategies, 
direct the launch of proper clinical trials, and provide 
targets for effective lifestyle and pharmacological 
interventions. Acquiring this knowledge is particularly 
timely and relevant considering the increasing 
recognition that many individuals at high fracture risk 
often do not receive fracture prevention interventions.7

WhAT IS AlReAdy knoWn on ThIS TopIC
The genetic determinants of fracture risk are not well described, and whether 
commonly used clinical risk factors for fracture are causal is not known 
For example, the effect of vitamin D supplementation in the general population 
on fracture risk is under debate; although such supplementation is part of 
clinical guidelines, recent randomised controlled trials have failed to consistently 
show a beneficial effect
WhAT ThIS STudy AddS
This mendelian randomisation study provides evidence against a causal effect 
of several proposed clinical risk factors for fractures (eg, diabetes, glucose, 
rheumatoid arthritis, and vitamin D)
Genetic predisposition to lower vitamin D levels and estimated calcium intake 
from dairy sources were not associated with fracture risk
However, these results highlight the central causal role of low bone mineral 
density in the pathophysiology of fracture risk

Fracture risk is a moderately heritable trait (whereby 
h2 is roughly 30%),8 9 for which no large scale, genome 
wide association studies (GWAS) have been undertaken 
so far. Large GWAS meta-analyses can also be used to 
perform mendelian randomisation analyses to explore 
the causal effects of heritable risk factors on disease 
in people, while reducing bias due to confounding 
(because genetic variation is essentially randomly 
assigned at conception) or reverse causation (because 
allele assignment always precedes disease onset).10 
Conceptually similar to a randomised controlled trial, 
the mendelian randomisation approach enables an 
assessment of the cumulative effect of a genetically 
determined exposure on fracture risk, minimising the 
biases that frequently weaken observational studies.
Understanding whether interventions aimed at 
clinical risk factors would reduce fracture risk is 
important, because clinicians often ensure that such 
risk factors are optimised in individuals at high risk 
of fracture. If the risk factors are not causal, then 
such optimisation would not decrease fracture risk. 
Therefore, to better understand genetic and clinical 
risk factors for fracture, we undertook a large scale 
GWAS for fracture risk in up to 264 973 participants 
(37 857 fracture cases) in the discovery stage and 
in conjunction with the largest available GWAS for 
clinical risk factors, determined the genetic correlation 
(shared heritability) of key clinical risk factors and 
fracture. We then performed mendelian randomisation 
studies to explore the causal effect of these risk factors 
on fracture.
Methods
Study populations
A total of 23 cohorts with genome wide genotyping 
and fracture data were recruited globally through 
the GEnetic Factors for OSteoporosis consortium 
(GEFOS; http://www.gefos.org/). These cohorts were 
predominantly of European descent and from Europe 
(n=13), North America (n=8), Australia (n=1), and east 
Asia (n=1; tables S1A and S2A), and included 20 439 
fracture cases and 78 843 controls. After meta-analysis, 
replication of promising findings was performed 
initially in the GENOMOS consortium (18 779 cases 
and 32 078 controls from 29 additional studies, 
tables S1B and S2B). Two additional large GWAS (UK 
Biobank, 14 492 cases and 130 563 controls; EPIC-
Norfolk study, 2926 cases and 17 710 controls) were 
then included in the discovery set, comprising in total 
37 857 cases and 227 116 controls (aged 18-106 years, 
including 69% women). Genetic markers reaching 
genome wide significance in this expanded meta-
analysis and previously reported bone mineral density 
markers associated with fracture11 were additionally 
replicated in 147 200 cases and 150 085 controls from 
23andMe, a personal genetic company (23andMe 
GWAS participants were customers who consented 
to participate in research with self reported fracture 
data). Figure S1 shows the overall study design. To 
enable two-sample mendelian randomisation studies, 
we compiled summary level results from the largest 
available GWAS meta-analyses performed so far on a 
large set of clinical risk factors for fracture (table 1). All 
studies were approved by their respective institutional 
ethics review committees and all participants provided 
written informed consent.
Study endpoint (fracture definition)
To maximise the statistical power to detect genetic 
loci, we used an inclusive definition of fracture, which 
was successfully used in previous efforts to test bone 
mineral density associated variants for association 
with fracture11 27 and allowed us to undertake the 
largest GWAS on fracture risk so far. Fracture cases 
were defined as those individuals (>18 years old) who 
had fractures at any skeletal site confirmed by medical, 
radiological, or questionnaire reports (table S3). 
Fractures of the fingers, toes, and skull as well as high 
trauma fractures were excluded whenever possible, 
although there have been some reports that even 
high trauma fractures are also predicted by low bone 
mineral density and are predictive of future low trauma 
fracture.28 29 Controls were defined as individuals (>18 
years old) from the same cohorts, without a history of 
fracture.
Fracture GWaS meta-analysis and replication
Genome wide genotyping was performed in each 
cohort by use of Illumina or Affymetrix genome wide 
genotyping chips (table S4A) and was imputed to ensure 
accurate ascertainment of nearly all common genetic 
variation above a minor allele frequency threshold of 
1%. After strict quality control criteria were applied 
to samples and single nucleotide polymorphisms 
(SNPs), we followed a consortium wide standardised 
analytical plan to assess the association of SNPs with 
risk of fracture. We used logistic regression adjusted 
for sex, age (simple and quadratic terms), height, and 
weight, testing additive (per allele) genetic effects. 
Before performing meta-analysis, three separate meta-
analytical centres checked the data independently. All 
individual GWAS were corrected by genomic control

before we performed a fixed effects meta-analysis using 
METAL software. A total of 2 539 801 autosomal SNPs 
present in more than two studies were meta-analysed. 
We took forward for replication a set of promising SNPs 
for de novo genotyping in 26 studies at LGC Genomics 
(UK), using KASP genotyping as described previously27 
(table S4B) and tested them in three more studies (table 
S4C), for a total of 29 studies. Allele and genotype 
frequencies of all genotyped variants followed Hardy-
Weinberg equilibrium proportions. To obtain unbiased 
estimates of effect size, all SNPs associated at a genome 
wide significant level (that is, P<5×10−8) and previously 
known bone mineral density fracture loci11 were tested 
for replication in the 23andMe cohort (table S4C).
Genetic determinants of risk factors for fracture
We used the genetic determinants of 15 available 
clinical risk factors from the largest GWAS datasets 
available. Genome wide association analyses have been 
published for bone mineral density (femoral neck and 
lumbar spine),11 age of puberty,19 age at menopause,12 
grip strength,18 vitamin D,24 25 homocysteine,17 thyroid 
stimulating hormone level,16 fasting glucose,20 21 type 
1 diabetes,15 type 2 diabetes,23 rheumatoid arthritis,13 
inflammatory bowel disease,14 and coronary artery 
disease.22 The well established lactose intolerance 
marker (LCT(C/T- 13910) polymorphism; rs4988235)30 was 
used as a surrogate to assess long term differences in 
dairy derived calcium intake.31 Additional risk factors 
were considered for inclusion; however, at the time of 
analyses, well powered GWAS were not available for 
some risk factors of interest including alcohol intake,32 
33 smoking34 and plasma calcium levels.35 Body mass 
index36 was not evaluated given that the fracture 
discovery analysis was adjusted for body weight and 
height.
Genetic correlation
We used LD score regression to estimate the genetic 
correlation of the selected clinical risk factors and 
fracture (table 1).37 This method estimates the degree 
of shared genetic risk factors between two diseases or 
traits, and was applied to 11 of the 15 selected risk 
factors for fracture (since genome wide association 
results were not publicly available for type 1 diabetes 
and thyroid stimulating hormone and dairy calcium 
intake). We accounted for multiple testing by using a 
conservative Bonferroni correction for 12 tests (that 
is, α=4.2×10−3). We also tested whether the above 
mentioned risk factors were genetically correlated with 
bone mineral density.
Mendelian randomisation
Next, we undertook mendelian randomisation analyses 
to estimate effects of 15 selected clinical risk factors in 
a two-sample mendelian randomisation framework. 
The mendelian randomisation approach was based on 
the following assumptions: 
•  
The genetic variants used as instrumental variables are 
associated with the clinical risk factors. 
•  
The genetic variants are not associated with any 
confounders of the exposure-outcome relation. 
•  
The genetic variants are associated with fracture only 
through the clinical risk factors—that is, a lack of pleiotropy 
(fig 1). 
We used the largest previously published GWAS meta-
analyses of the risk factors, at the time of analyses, to 
maximise statistical power (table S5A).38-41 To reduce 
potential bias due to population stratification, we 
restricted the analyses to studies with participants of 
European descent. To ensure independence between 
the SNPs used to evaluate the association of the risk 
factor and fracture risk, we grouped by LD (r2>0.05) 
those SNPs achieving genome wide significance, 
keeping only the SNP with the lowest P value per group. 
Next, we recorded the effect size and standard error 
attributed to each allele’s effect on the risk factor (table 
S5B). Finally, for age of menopause, we performed sex 
specific mendelian randomisation analysis in women 
only.
The resulting individual SNP effect estimates were 
pooled by use of the Wald type ratio estimator, which 
is formally analogous to an inverse weighted meta-
analysis.42 Again, we applied a conservative Bonferroni 
corrected threshold (that is, α=3.3×10−3, because 15 
risk factors were assessed) to account for the multiple 
risk factors tested. We also tested the assumptions 
underlying the mendelian randomisation approach (fig 
1). To test the third assumption (a lack of pleiotropic 
effects of the SNPs on the outcome, independent of 
the exposure), we used mendelian randomisation-
Egger regression.43 Moreover, as sensitivity analyses 
for robust causal inference, we additionally performed 
mendelian randomisation analyses using a weighted 
median estimator and penalised weighted median 
estimator. We also tested the effect of the same 
clinical risk factors on bone mineral density27 using 
the same methods. For the binary exposures, the 
odds ratios were converted (by multiplying log-odds 
ratios by 0.693 and then exponentiating) in order 
to represent the odds ratio per doubling of the odds

of susceptibility to disease.44 Finally, we undertook 
mendelian randomisation power calculations45 for all 
such analyses.
Patient involvement
No patients were directly involved in the design, 
recruitment, or conduct of the study. Nevertheless, 
several of the participating studies comprised 
collections of patients who were made aware of their 
contribution of medical data to research through their 
informed consents signed by all study participants. 
After publication, dissemination of the results will be 
sought across different countries involving respective 
patient organisations, the general public, and other 
stakeholders; typically, across social media, scientific 
meetings and media interviews. Finally, some studies 
sent newsletters informing their participants about 
important findings and their implications.
Results
Genetic loci associated with fracture
We saw was no evidence of excessive genomic inflation 
(λ=1.02, LD score intercept=0.99) in the GWAS meta-
analysis, suggesting that the results were not biased 
because of population stratification, genotyping 
artefacts, or cryptic family relationships (fig 2). As 
shown in table 2 and figure 2, 15 genomic loci were 
associated at a genome wide significant level with 
fracture risk after meta-analysis of the discovery 
(table S6A) and replication (tables S6B, S6C, and S6D) 
stages. All loci were at, or near, loci previously shown 
to be associated with bone mineral density,11 27 46-52 a 
major determinant of fracture risk (table S6E and figure 
S2). The effect sizes of these common SNPs on fracture 
risk was modest (odds ratios ranging from 1.03 to 
1.10), which is consistent with GWAS findings for other 
complex diseases.53
Genetic correlations with clinical risk factors
SNPs influencing bone mineral density were strongly 
and inversely correlated with odds of fracture (table 3; 
genetic correlation −0.59, P=2×10−24 for femoral neck 
bone mineral density, with similar results for lumbar 
spine bone mineral density, −0.53, P=1×10−20). By 
contrast, none of the remaining clinical risk factors 
evaluated was strongly genetically correlated with risk 
of fracture with the exception of homocysteine (table 
3). Genetically increased risk of type 2 diabetes was 
positively correlated with femoral neck bone mineral 
density, while genetically increased grip strength had 
positive correlations with bone mineral density of both 
the femoral neck and lumbar spine (table S7).
Mendelian randomisation
Using mendelian randomisation analyses to assess 
the effect of the 15 risk factors on fracture, we saw 
evidence for a major effect of genetically decreased 
bone mineral density on fracture risk (fig 3 and table 4; 
odds ratio per standard deviation decrease in femoral 
neck bone mineral density=1.55, 95% confidence 
interval 1.48 to 1.63, P=1.5×10−68). We also observed a 
large effect of grip strength on fracture risk (2.14, 1.13 
to 4.04, P=0.01), but these results had wide confidence 
intervals and were not significant after multiple testing 
correction. 
Vitamin D levels assessed by use of 25-hydroxy-
vitamin D variants were not found to be linearly 
associated with increased fracture risk (odds ratio per 
standard deviation decrease=0.84, 95% confidence 
interval 0.70 to 1.02, P=0.07). Most of these 
mendelian randomisation effects did not seem to be

strongly influenced by directional pleiotropy, because 
the intercepts of the mendelian randomisation-Egger 
test were tightly centred around the null, except for 
rheumatoid arthritis, type 2 diabetes, grip strength, 
glucose, and homocysteine levels (table 4). The 
estimates from the inverse variance weighted fixed 
meta-analysis were very similar to the estimates from 
the weighted median and penalised weighted median 
method (table S8). However, despite some indication 
of causality of fasting glucose levels on fracture risk 
(table S8) in the median weighted analyses, it did not 
surpass the multiple testing threshold. 
Consistent with the results of the genetic correlation 
analyses, we found that none of the other evaluated 
clinical risk factors had evidence of a causal effect 
on risk of fracture, despite adequate statistical power 
(mean=98% (range 56-100%), table 4).45 When 
evaluating the effect of genetically increased risk 
factors on bone mineral density (table S9), only age 
of puberty had an effect on bone mineral density after 
accounting for multiple testing; fasting glucose, type 2 
diabetes, and age at menopause had marginal effects, 
consistent with a recent mendelian randomisation 
study of type 2 diabetes and glycaemic traits on bone 
mineral density.54
We next undertook careful evaluation of the three 
mendelian randomisation assumptions. The first 
assumption was verified by the selection of only 
common variants (minor allele frequency >5%) 
strongly associated with the clinical risk factor 
(P<5×10−8). After performing a thorough literature 
search, we can exclude reported associations between 
the genetic variants and potential confounding factors 
(second assumption). Finally, by using mendelian 
randomisation-Egger regression, we found no evidence 
of the presence of pleiotropy between the instruments 
and the outcomes (table 4).

bone mineral density. Using mendelian randomisation 
analyses, we demonstrated that genetically decreased 
bone mineral density (and, to a lesser extent, hand 
grip strength) was the only clinical risk factor among 
those tested, with evidence for an effect on fracture 
risk. By contrast, despite high statistical power, none 
of the other tested and well accepted risk factors (eg, 
rheumatoid arthritis and other causes of secondary 
osteoporosis) or any of the other clinically relevant risk 
factors (vitamin D levels, dairy food derived calcium 
intake, fasting glucose, type 2 diabetes, and coronary 
heart disease) had evidence of a major causal effect 
on fracture risk. Furthermore, all identified genetic 
determinants of fracture also influenced bone mineral 
density.
In our previous work,11 we tested 96 bone mineral 
density markers for association with fracture. In the 
meta-analysis, 14 bone mineral density loci were 
associated with fracture risk (P<5×10−4), of which 
six surpassed genome wide significance (P<5×10−8). 
In our current project, we began with GWAS meta-
analysis for fracture risk. We confirmed the 2p16.2 
(SPTBN1), 7q21.3 (SHFM1), 10q21.1 (MBL2/DKK1), 
11q13.2 (LRP5), and 18p11.21 (FAM210A) loci, and 
observed an increased signal at SOST, CPED1/WNT16, 
FUPB3, DCDC5, RPS6KA5, STARD3NL, and CTNNB1. 
Lastly, we added the 6q22.33 (RSPO3), 6q25.1 (ESR1), 
7p12.1 (GRB10/COBL), and 21q22.2 (ETS2) loci to 
the list of novel fracture loci. Among the genome

contain well established causal proteins for fracture 
risk that are targets for clinically useful osteoporotic 
fracture treatments, such as ESR1, which encodes 
the oestrogen receptor, and SOST, which encodes 
sclerostin.55 These discoveries highlight known and 
novel factors in pathways critical to bone biology (that 
is, Wnt, for mesenchymal stem cell differentiation) as 
well as potential new factors and biological pathways 
that might constitute future drug targets.56
All the discovered fracture loci are also associated 
with bone mineral density, implying that skeletal 
fragility characterised by reduced bone mineral density 
is central to the pathophysiology of osteoporotic 
fracture. This contention is in line with the significant 
genetic correlation we identified between bone mineral 
density and fracture. Our mendelian randomisation 
analyses also indicate that the suggestive effect of 
late puberty and earlier age at menopause on fracture 
risk is, at least partly, mediated through reduced bone 
mineral density. By contrast, hand grip strength was 
not found to be a determinant of bone mineral density, 
and vice versa. Still, grip strength could be a proxy 
for overall muscle strength and risk of falling, and 
could be involved in a pathway leading to fracture 
independently of bone mineral density.56 However, the 
hand grip estimates holds wide confidence intervals 
in our analyses expressed in standard deviations to 
allow comparison to other risk factors. We believe that 
these large standard deviations can be attributed to 
multiple factors, including effort and encouragement 
of the participants, posture, position, and intrinsic 
measurement variability between individuals. A recent 
effort using UK Biobank data also showed through 
mendelian randomisation that higher grip strength 
is associated with decreased fracture risk.18 As such, 
inclusion of grip strength (or a different assessment 
of muscle function such as leg strength) could 
improve the predictive performance of risk prediction 
calculators that already contain bone mineral density, 
just as has been reported for a history of falls.56
Older individuals at high risk of fractures often have 
low levels of vitamin D (owing to low dietary intake 
and sun exposure). Therefore, fracture prevention 
guidelines have suggested the use of vitamin D 
supplementation in the general population.57 58 
These recommendations have contributed to the 
marked increase in vitamin D use in older populations 
worldwide, where in the United States alone the 
proportion of individuals aged 70 years and older who 
use at least 1000 IU of vitamin D daily increased about 
100-fold from 2000 to 2014.59 Despite these guideline 
recommendations, it is unclear whether modestly low 
levels of vitamin D, rather than profoundly low values, 
are causally associated with a higher risk of fracture. 
Our mendelian randomisation work examined a linear 
relation between vitamin D levels and fracture risk. We 
did not test for the possibility of a threshold dependent 
relation—that is, effects that could be present only at 
very low levels of vitamin D. Nevertheless, our analyses 
showed that vitamin D levels had no protective linear 
effect on fracture in community dwelling individuals, 
despite adequate statistical power. We also show, in 
line with other previous reports,60-62 no evidence for 
a causal effect of vitamin D levels on bone mineral 
density. Although a threshold effect is likely to be 
present, where profoundly lowered vitamin D levels do 
increase risk of fracture, our mendelian randomisation 
results strongly suggest that increasing levels of 
vitamin D in the (non-deficient) general population is 
unlikely to decrease risk of fracture.
Likewise, calcium supplementation has been called 
into question recently. A mendelian randomisation 
study found that higher levels of serum calcium are 
a risk factor for coronary heart disease,63 supporting 
the current recommendation of not exceeding total 
calcium intake of 1200 mg/day in older individuals.64 
Further, our study assessed the lactose persistence 
variant as a surrogate of long term intake of dairy 
calcium (used previously as an instrument for dairy 
consumption in association with blood pressure26 and 
other traits), and found no evidence for a protective 
effect of sustained intake of dairy derived calcium on 
fracture risk.
comparison with other studies
Previous observational studies and clinical trials 
have reported the beneficial effect of vitamin D65 66 or 
calcium67 supplementation on fracture risk reduction, 
findings which are not supported by our results. 
These discrepant findings can be due to inadequate 
methods or high heterogeneity induced, for example, 
by combining community dwelling participants and 
inpatients in the same analysis. Consistent with our 
findings, a recent meta-analysis of 33 randomised 
trials68 (n=51 145) found that supplementation with 
calcium, vitamin D, or both did not decrease the 
incidence of fractures in community dwelling older 
adults. Findings such as these should be interpreted 
with caution, because they do not necessarily apply 
to 
patients

osteoporosis 
treatment, 
considering 
that 
trials 
evaluating 
osteoporosis 
treatment are carried out concomitant with vitamin D 
and calcium supplementation. 
Studies seeking to show whether these supplements 
do increase the efficacy of osteoporotic treatment 
or decrease adverse events (that is, hypocalcaemia) 
are lacking. In either case, screening for vitamin 
D deficiency and seeking its correction should be 
warranted before the initiation of anti-resorptive 
treatment.

cm2 change in femoral neck bone mineral density per

D). However, increased 25-hydroxy-vitamin D was 
associated with a slight reduction in heel bone mineral 
density estimated by ultrasonography (n=142 487;

D). These results are consistent with our mendelian 
randomisation findings of no causal effect of vitamin 
D levels on fracture.
implications for clinicians
Our mendelian randomisation findings are relevant 
to clinical care. Although clinical risk factors, when 
used jointly in well validated prediction algorithms, 
predict fracture risk, our findings are a reminder 
that clinically relevant changes in most of these risk 
factors are unlikely to result in large differences in 
fracture risk. These findings also suggest clinical 
outcomes such as fracture risk can be subject to bias 
owing to uncontrolled confounding in observational 
epidemiological studies. A strength of our study 
design is that mendelian randomisation limits this 
potential confounding, because alleles are essentially 
assigned randomly at conception, and are therefore 
not generally affected by confounders. Furthermore, 
because allele assignment must precede fracture, 
mendelian randomisation is not prone to bias due to 
reverse causation. These findings provide guidance for 
the design of future clinical trials on interventions that 
are more likely to be successful in reducing fracture 
risk.
Epidemiological studies have shown that older 
people with a fracture will have abnormal bone 
mineral density in the osteoporotic range (that is, T 
score lower than −2.5 standard deviations), but most 
will have a fracture will be osteopenic (T score between 
−1 and −2.5 standard deviations). In fact, about 
87% of women and 82% of men with a non-vertebral 
fracture have a T score lower than −1.0.69 Our findings 
suggest that low bone mineral density (not only after 
reaching the osteoporotic range) constitutes a risk 
factor that captures a substantial and causal part of the 
influences that increase risk for all types of fracture. 
Therefore, interventions targeting an increase in bone 
mineral density (presuming this is associated with 
improvements in bone structure or quality) are likely 
to have pivotal roles in reducing fracture risk.
The 
interpretation 
of 
our 
findings 
merits 
careful consideration for some of the risk factors. 
Hyperthyroidism is an established risk factor for 
fracture, and we have not used genetic determinants of 
hyperthyroidism risk, but rather genetic determinants 
of thyroid stimulating hormone level, which are likely 
to be different. Moreover, our study described the 
effect of clinical risk factors on fracture in the general 
population, and is therefore not generalisable to states 
or conditions of extreme circumstances known to cause 
fracture (eg, sustained vitamin D deficiency, rickets, or 
osteomalacia). Furthermore, our results apply only to 
25-hydroxy-vitamin D, and might not necessarily reflect 
effects of its active form, 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D. 
However, vitamin D supplementation, as is commonly 
used, acts by influencing 25-hydroxy-vitamin D. 
Altogether, the course of action for effective fracture 
prevention relies on establishing vitamin D deficiency 
and seeking its correction, rather than the widespread 
use of non-indicated ineffective supplementation.
Strengths and weaknesses of the study
To our knowledge, we have generated the largest 
and most comprehensive assessment of the genetic 
determinants of fracture risk so far. Moreover, use of 
the largest GWAS datasets available enabled adequate 
power to estimate the relation between genetically 
modified risk factors and fracture. Our study also 
had limitations. In our mendelian randomisation 
approach, we were unable to account for the sample 
overlap between the exposure and outcome GWAS 
datasets. However, we used powerful instruments to 
estimate the relation39 between the risk factors and 
the outcomes. Therefore, any sample overlap should 
not significantly bias our findings. Another potential 
limitation was that the first release of the UK Biobank 
selected some individuals based on a nested case-
control study of smoking and lung function,70 and is 
therefore subject to selection bias.71 But after excluding 
the UK Biobank from our analyses, we observed no 
significant differences. Furthermore, the majority of 
our cohorts were imputed to HapMap (instead of more 
comprehensive reference panels), which could have 
affected the number of identified loci. However, given 
our power setting, our focus was mainly on common 
variants (which are well characterised in the HapMap 
imputation panel). In addition, analysis of large 
cohorts (UK Biobank and EPIC-Norfolk) imputed to 
more recent reference panels did not yield additional 
genome wide significant loci.
Moreover, we could not assess several relevant 
clinical risk factors. For example, body mass index72-74 
could not be assessed in our mendelian randomisation 
framework because all GWAS analyses of fracture 
have been adjusted for body weight, preventing any 
inference assessment on causality. We also lacked 
power to estimate the casual relation between smoking 
and alcohol consumption: two potentially key risk 
factors for fracture. Similarly, we did not evaluate other 
risk factors that were not modifiable (such as age, sex, 
parental fracture history and body height), or those 
that have not been assessed by GWAS to yield genetic 
instruments for mendelian randomisation studies 
(such as falls, which are likely to be an important 
modifiable risk factor for fracture).75
Furthermore, factors unlikely to be predominantly 
genetic in origin (eg, occupation) might still have a role 
in the pathogenesis of fracture but could not be readily 
assessed through our mendelian randomisation 
approach. Nevertheless, proxy phenotypes for such risk 
factors are increasingly been investigated by GWAS (eg, 
education for occupation), and can be used as robust 
instruments in future research. In addition, because 
information on bone mineral density was not available 
for all study participants who were investigated for 
fracture, we could not determine directly the degree 
to which bone mineral density mediated the effect 
of genetic determinants on fracture risk. Mendelian 
randomisation is a helpful method to minimise several 
biases in observational studies, but the possibility of 
residual pleiotropy could bias estimates in this study. 
However, the likelihood of this bias is reduced because

the mendelian randomisation-Egger regression test 
showed no clear directional pleiotropy for most of the 
factors. Lastly, because most of the study population 
was of European ancestry, results should not be 
directly generalised to other ethnicities.
Similarly, null results of a mendelian randomisation 
study could be influenced by canalisation, which is 
defined as compensatory feedback mechanisms that 
cannot be taken into account.76 The possible influence 
of the risk factors on fracture risk might be specifically 
linked to their complications or management of the 
disease, which we also could not take into account in 
mendelian randomisation. As in most epidemiological 
studies, mendelian randomisation also assumes 
a linear relation between the risk factor and the 
outcome, which might not invariably be the case for 
all risk factors of fracture. Some risk factors, such as 
vitamin D and estimated calcium intake, could have 
non-linear threshold associations, as discussed above. 
Furthermore, we could not account for the dose-
response association (eg, between the lactose variant 
rs4988235 and dairy intake) within our design, or 
differences in biological effects across different types of 
grouped exposures (that is, fermented v non-fermented 
types of dairy products). Finally, the non-significant 
trend observed for vitamin D towards having increased 
risk of fracture could be attributed to the selection 
of healthy people (that is, participants with very low 
levels of vitamin D and fracture, as well as those who 
are older, frail, and physically impaired, could have 
been under-represented in the studies included in 
the GWAS meta-analyses). Therefore, the vitamin D 
estimates of the current study cannot be generalised to 
these groups of older people.
conclusion
From a study of over 500 000 individuals (about 
185 000 fracture cases), we provide evidence that the 
main genetic determinants of osteoporotic fracture 
also influence bone mineral density, which was the 
only clinical risk factor to have shown a major effect 
on fracture risk among the study population assessed. 
By contrast, we found that other genetically estimated 
clinical risk factors for fracture, had either a very 
modest or no effect on fracture risk in the general 
population. Notably, genetic predisposition to lower 
levels of vitamin D and estimated calcium intake 
from dairy sources were not associated with fracture 
risk. Our study confirms bone mineral density as a 
pivotal cause of osteoporotic fracture and postulates 
that, among all the clinical risk factors we evaluated, 
interventions aimed at increasing bone mineral density 
are likely to have the most clinically relevant effect on 
fracture risk reduction.
