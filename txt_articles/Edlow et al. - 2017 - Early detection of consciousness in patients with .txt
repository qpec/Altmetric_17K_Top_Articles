Patients with acute severe traumatic brain injury may recover consciousness before self-expression. Without behavioural evidence
of consciousness at the bedside, clinicians may render an inaccurate prognosis, increasing the likelihood of withholding life-sus-
taining therapies or denying rehabilitative services. Task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography
techniques have revealed covert consciousness in the chronic setting, but these techniques have not been tested in the intensive care
unit. We prospectively enrolled 16 patients admitted to the intensive care unit for acute severe traumatic brain injury to test two
hypotheses: (i) in patients who lack behavioural evidence of language expression and comprehension, functional magnetic reson-
ance imaging and electroencephalography detect command-following during a motor imagery task (i.e. cognitive motor dissoci-
ation) and association cortex responses during language and music stimuli (i.e. higher-order cortex motor dissociation); and
(ii) early responses to these paradigms are associated with better 6-month outcomes on the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended.
Patients underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging on post-injury Day 9.2 � 5.0 and electroencephalography on Day
9.8 � 4.6. At the time of imaging, behavioural evaluation with the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised indicated coma (n = 2), vegetative
state (n = 3), minimally conscious state without language (n = 3), minimally conscious state with language (n = 4) or post-traumatic
confusional state (n = 4). Cognitive motor dissociation was identified in four patients, including three whose behavioural diagnosis
suggested a vegetative state. Higher-order cortex motor dissociation was identified in two additional patients. Complete absence of
responses to language, music and motor imagery was only observed in coma patients. In patients with behavioural evidence of
language function, responses to language and music were more frequently observed than responses to motor imagery (62.5–80%
versus 33.3–42.9%). Similarly, in 16 matched healthy subjects, responses to language and music were more frequently observed
than responses to motor imagery (87.5–100% versus 68.8–75.0%). Except for one patient who died in the intensive care unit, all
patients with cognitive motor dissociation and higher-order cortex motor dissociation recovered beyond a confusional state by
6 months. However, 6-month outcomes were not associated with early functional magnetic resonance imaging and electroenceph-
alography responses for the entire cohort. These observations suggest that functional magnetic resonance imaging and electroen-
cephalography can detect command-following and higher-order cortical function in patients with acute severe traumatic brain
injury. Early detection of covert consciousness and cortical responses in the intensive care unit could alter time-sensitive decisions
about withholding life-sustaining therapies.

Introduction
Current clinical tools are not reliable for detecting con-
sciousness or predicting recovery in patients with severe
traumatic brain injury (TBI). Bedside behavioural examin-
ation, the gold standard for clinical assessment of con-
sciousness, may be limited by a patient’s neurological
deficits (e.g. aphasia, quadriparesis), fluctuating state (e.g.
related to arousal, pain, medical complications) or an
examiner’s
subjective
interpretation
of
ambiguous
re-
sponses (Gill-Thwaites, 2006). These limitations lead to
an approximately 40% rate of misclassifying conscious pa-
tients as unconscious (Childs et al., 1993; Andrews et al.,
1996; Schnakers et al., 2009). Given that early recovery of
consciousness is associated with better long-term functional
outcomes (Giacino and Kalmar, 1997; Whyte et al., 2001),
the absence of a reliable diagnostic tool for detecting con-
sciousness in the intensive care unit (ICU) creates uncer-
tainty for families facing decisions about continuation of
life-sustaining treatments and limits access to rehabilitative
care for patients who are given inaccurate poor prognoses.
Since a landmark study in 2006 demonstrated that func-
tional MRI can detect evidence of consciousness in a pa-
tient whose chronic behavioural examination suggested a
vegetative state (also referred to as unresponsive wakeful-
ness syndrome) (Owen et al., 2006), there has been grow-
ing interest in using functional imaging techniques to
identify covert consciousness, or cognitive motor dissoci-
ation (CMD) (Schiff, 2015). Recent functional MRI and
EEG studies using active motor imagery tasks have demon-
strated that a small but important minority of patients with
chronic post-traumatic disorders of consciousness shows
signs
of
CMD,
as
evidenced
by
command-following
during the task (Monti et al., 2010; Cruse et al., 2011).
In addition, studies using passive language and music
stimuli have shown that some patients with chronic
post-traumatic disorders of consciousness demonstrate
association cortex responses despite absent behavioural
evidence
of
language
expression
and
comprehension
(Coleman et al., 2009; Okumura et al., 2014), a state
defined here as higher-order cortex motor dissociation
(HMD). Yet, despite emerging evidence that functional
MRI and EEG can detect CMD and HMD in patients
with chronic post-traumatic disorders of consciousness,
no studies have focused on ICU patients with acute
severe TBI. Early detection of consciousness and higher-
order cortical function in this population could not only
inform the diagnosis of level of consciousness but could
also predict subsequent recovery of meaningful neuro-
logical
function
(Giacino
and
Kalmar,
1997;
Whyte
et al., 2001; Coleman et al., 2009; Stender et al., 2014).
Furthermore, early, reliable, and objective information
about a patient’s level of consciousness may assist care-
giver and family decision-making in the ICU.
In this prospective observational study, we hypothesized
that: (i) stimulus-based functional MRI and EEG detect
CMD and HMD in ICU patients with acute severe TBI;
and
(ii)
better
6-month
outcomes
on
the
Glasgow
Outcome
Scale-Extended
(GOSE)
are
associated
with
early functional MRI and EEG responses.
Materials and methods
Experimental design
We prospectively screened all patients with TBI admitted to
the Neurosciences ICU, Multidisciplinary ICU, and Surgical
ICU at a single academic hospital between June 2012 and
November 2014. Inclusion criteria were: (i) age 18 to 65
years; and (ii) head trauma with Glasgow Coma Scale score

 of 3–8 with no eye opening for at least 24 h. Exclusion criteria
were: (i) life expectancy 56 months, as estimated by a treating
physician; (ii) prior severe brain injury or neurodegenerative
disease; (iii) penetrating TBI with intracranial metal or other
body metal precluding MRI; and (iv) no fluency in English
prior to the injury (because the functional MRI and EEG para-
digms were administered in English).
Surrogate decision-makers were approached for consent
524 h after injury, and written informed consent was obtained
in accordance with a research protocol approved by our
Institutional Review Board. Functional MRI was performed
as soon as the patient was clinically stable for transport to
the MRI scanner, as determined by the treating ICU physicians
and nurses. Whenever possible, the EEG was scheduled within
24 h of the functional MRI scan to enable comparison of the
functional MRI and EEG data. Administration of sedative,
anxiolytic, and/or analgesic medications was allowed for pa-
tient safety or comfort during the functional MRI and/or the
EEG.
A cohort of age- and sex-matched healthy subjects was en-
rolled to compare their functional MRI and EEG responses to
those of the patient sample. Healthy subjects had no history of
neurological, psychiatric, cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal or
endocrinological disease. They provided written informed con-
sent and underwent the same functional MRI and EEG proto-
cols as the patients. All patient and healthy subject MRI scans
were performed on the same scanner, and EEGs were per-
formed using the same equipment.
Neurobehavioural and outcome
assessments
Demographic and clinical data were collected at the time of
enrolment in accordance with the National Institutes of Health
Common Data Element Guidelines for TBI (Maas et al., 2010).
Immediately prior to functional MRI and EEG, each patient’s
level of consciousness was characterized via behavioural evalu-
ation with the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R) (Giacino
et al., 2004) as coma, vegetative state, minimally conscious
state without language function (MCS�; i.e. at least one of
the following: visual fixation, visual pursuit, object localiza-
tion, localization to noxious stimulation, object manipulation,
automatic motor responses, or non-functional communica-
tion),
minimally
conscious
state
with
language
function
(MCS+ ; i.e. at least one of the following: command-following,
object recognition, or intelligible verbalization) (Giacino et al.,
2002; Bruno et al., 2012b; Schnakers et al., 2015a), or emer-
gence from the MCS (i.e. functional object use and/or func-
tional communication). If a patient emerged from MCS, the
diagnosis of post-traumatic confusional state (PTCS; Stuss
et al., 1999) was confirmed based on criteria derived from
the Confusion Assessment Protocol (CAP) (Sherer et al., 2005).
Functional outcome at 6 months was measured with the
GOSE (Wilson et al., 1998). Patients and their surrogates
were assessed either in-person at the study site or, if this was
not feasible, through a validated GOSE phone questionnaire
(Pettigrew et al., 2003). Six-month level of consciousness was
also recorded for patients who returned for in-person CRS-R
and CAP evaluation and for patients whose medical records
from an affiliated rehabilitation hospital included clinical as-
sessments
with
the
CRS-R
and
CAP.
All
behavioural
evaluations and outcome assessments were conducted by a
single investigator (B.L.E). Additional details regarding charac-
teristics of the CRS-R, CAP, and GOSE are provided in the
Supplementary material.
Functional MRI data acquisition
MRI data were acquired with a 32-channel head coil on a 3T
Skyra MRI scanner (Siemens Medical Solutions) located in the
Neurosciences ICU. Auditory stimuli were presented to all
subjects via MRI-compatible earphones (Newmatic Medical)
connected to the scanner’s sound system. The blood oxygen
level-dependent (BOLD) functional MRI sequence used the fol-
lowing parameters: echo time = 30ms, repetition time = 4000ms,
in-plane resolution = 2.0 � 2.0mm, slice thickness = 2mm, inter-
slice gap = 2.5mm, matrix = 94 � 94, field of view = 192 �
192mm2, 49 slices, 2� GRAPPA acceleration. High-spatial
resolution 3D T1-weighted multi-echo magnetization prepared
gradient echo (MEMPRAGE) anatomical images were acquired
for registration purposes (van der Kouwe et al., 2008): field of
view = 256 � 256mm2, acquisition matrix = 256 � 256, 176 sa-
gittal slices (thickness 1 mm), 3� GRAPPA acceleration, echo
time = 1.69, 3.55, 5.41, and 7.27ms, repetition time = 2530 ms,
inversion time = 1200–1300ms, 1.0mm3 isotropic resolution,
flip angle = 7�.
Stimulus-based functional MRI
paradigms
Each functional MRI paradigm utilized a block design and
was comprised of two runs, with each run containing three
24-s
rest
blocks
and
two
24-s
stimulation
blocks
(Supplementary Fig. 1). In total, 144 s of rest data and 96 s
of stimulation data were analysed for each paradigm. Prior to
the first rest block, 36 s of data were acquired to obtain a
stable baseline BOLD signal. These data were excluded from
analysis.
The language paradigm consisted of alternating 24-s blocks
of rest, forwards language, rest, backwards language, and rest.
The forwards language stimulus was a clip from John F.
Kennedy’s Inaugural Address. This 24-s clip was time-reversed
to create the backwards language stimulus. Backwards lan-
guage functional MRI data were acquired as part of a pre-
planned
secondary
analysis,
based
on
findings
from
a
previous study showing that differential cortical activation pat-
terns during forwards versus backwards language may reveal
linguistic processing as compared with non-linguistic process-
ing (Fernandez-Espejo et al., 2008). The backwards language
acoustically matched the forwards language but violated sev-
eral phonological properties of language. These characteristics
make backwards language a potential control condition for
non-linguistic
aspects
of speech (Fernandez-Espejo et al.,
2008).
The music paradigm used the same block design as the lan-
guage paradigm. The music stimulus was a 24-s clip from
Aaron Copland’s ‘Rodeo – Four Dance Episodes’ with fre-
quent changes in tempo, to increase the probability of obser-
ving a brain response to music (Danielsen et al., 2014), and no
lyrics, to investigate cortical processing of prosody and rhythm
without processing linguistic content (Danielsen et al., 2014).
This paradigm was included based on prior studies suggesting

 that music alters cortical activity and connectivity in healthy
subjects (Kovacs et al., 2006; Brattico et al., 2011; Wu et al.,
2013) and patients with impaired consciousness (O’Kelly et al.,
2013; Okumura et al., 2014).
The motor imagery paradigm involved a right hand squeeze
imagery
task
previously
used
in
patients
with
chronic
disorders of consciousness (Cruse et al., 2011, 2012). This
paradigm used the same block design as the language and
music paradigms, except that instructions were repeated at
6-s
intervals
(e.g.
‘keep
squeezing’
or
‘keep
resting’).
Instructions administered before and during the functional
MRI scan are detailed in the Supplementary material and
in Supplementary Table 1.
Functional MRI data analysis
In a first-level analysis of the individual runs, functional MRI
data
processing
was
performed
using
the
FMRI
Expert
Analysis Tool (FEAT) version 6.00 in FSL 5.0.7 (FMRIB’s
Software
Library,
www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl).
Forwards
lan-
guage, music and motor imagery stimuli were contrasted
against rest and forwards language was also contrasted against
backwards
language.
Z-statistic
images
were
thresholded
(Z 4 3.1) and a corrected cluster significance threshold of
P = 0.05 was used. Higher-level analysis was carried out
using a fixed effects model (FLAME in FSL) (Beckmann
et al., 2003; Woolrich et al., 2004). The statistical threshold
for cluster significance (Z 4 3.1) and the size of the Gaussian
kernel (full-width at half-maximum = 10 mm) were both se-
lected to decrease false positive cluster activations (Eklund
et al., 2016). Additional details on analysis are provided in
the Supplementary material.
We then used FEATQuery in FSL to quantify the percentage
of voxels activated within each stimulus-specific region of
interest. For healthy subjects, we defined a positive response
by the criterion that 40% of region of interest voxels met the
aforementioned statistical threshold. For patients, we defined a
positive response by two criteria: (i) 40% of region of interest
voxels met the statistical threshold; and (ii) the percentage of
activated region of interest voxels was above the 2.5th percent-
ile of a normal range (2.5th to 97.5th percentile) derived from
the age- and sex-matched healthy subjects’ data for each
region of interest in each paradigm. Although a single investi-
gator performed the behavioural assessments and the func-
tional
MRI
analyses
(B.L.E.),
the
acute
behavioural
evaluation always preceded the functional MRI analysis, and
our quantitative approach to functional MRI analysis reduced
the likelihood that bias was inadvertently introduced due to
knowledge of a patient’s behavioural diagnosis.
Functional MRI regions of interest
We selected a priori regions of interest based upon functional
MRI studies of language, music and motor imagery in patients
with chronic traumatic disorders of consciousness and healthy
subjects. For the language and music stimuli, we used the bi-
lateral Heschl’s gyrus and superior temporal gyrus regions of
interest distributed by the Harvard-Oxford Cortical Structural
Atlas (Makris et al., 2006) (Fig. 1). To reduce the false positive
rate (FPR), we only considered superior temporal gyrus acti-
vation in subjects who also demonstrated activation within
Heschl’s gyrus primary auditory cortex. For the motor imagery
task,
the
bilateral
supplementary
motor
areas
from
the
Harvard-Oxford Cortical Structural Atlas and premotor cor-
tices from the Juelich Histological Atlas (Eickhoff et al., 2005)
were combined as a single region of interest (Fig. 1 and
Supplementary Fig. 2). All regions of interest were transformed
from standard atlas space into patient native functional MRI
space for analysis, consistent with prior functional MRI studies
of patients with disorders of consciousness (Fernandez-Espejo
et al., 2008; Coleman et al., 2009; Monti et al., 2010; Bardin
et al., 2011). See Supplementary material for additional details.
EEG data acquisition and
preprocessing
EEG data were acquired using a 19-electrode clinical XLTEK
EEG system (Natus Medical Inc.) at a 200- or 256-Hz sam-
pling rate and analysed using EEGlab (Delorme and Makeig,
2004) and customized MATLAB code (MathWorks, Natick,
MA). All recordings were filtered (third-order Butterworth,
zero-phase
shift
digital
filter, 1–30 Hz)
and re-referenced
using the Hjorth Laplacian transform to optimize spatial lo-
calization and avoid contaminating activity at the reference
(Lepage et al., 2014). Artefact rejection was performed with
EEGlab using independent component analysis by a research
Figure 1 Regions of interest for functional MRI analysis.

 neuropsychologist (C.C.). For patients, trials with large arte-
facts were discarded by consensus review with a fellowship-
trained clinical neurophysiologist/epileptologist (E.S.R., C.C.).
EEG recordings were also reviewed post hoc for evidence of
epileptiform activity (E.S.R.) using the American Clinical
Neurophysiology Society criteria (Hirsch et al., 2013). Both
EEG analysts were blind to the behavioural diagnosis and
functional MRI results.
Stimulus-based EEG paradigms
Auditory stimuli were administered via a portable speaker
system (Scosche Inc.) placed on a table next to the subject’s
bed. The EEG language, music, and motor imagery paradigms
were the same as the functional MRI paradigms, except that
the EEG paradigms used 12 24-s blocks of stimulus and rest
(Supplementary Fig. 3). Also, the backwards language stimulus
was not administered during EEG.
EEG classification using power
spectral density
Following artefact rejection, we estimated the power spectral
density of the voltage activity recorded at each electrode.
Absolute power estimates were averaged within four frequency
bands [delta (1–3 Hz), theta (4–7 Hz), alpha (8–13 Hz), beta
(14–30 Hz)], resulting in a matrix (76 features � 576 s for
music and language or 388 s for motor imagery) that was
used for classifier analysis. Any segments where data had
been removed following artefact rejection were padded to pre-
serve indexing between trials.
For each patient and paradigm (language, music, and motor
imagery), we used a support vector machine with a linear
kernel to classify the data matrices as corresponding to
either stimulation blocks (on) or rest blocks (off) (Burges,
1998). We used a 20-fold cross-validation procedure repeated
10 times to ensure a stable classifier accuracy estimate and
used the average accuracy of these 10 iterations for analysis.
We chose 20-fold as it provided the most stable results in our
healthy subject cohort. For each iteration of the cross-valid-
ation, we randomly generated 20 disjoint partitions of each
subject’s data matrix such that 19 folds were used for training
and the last fold was used for evaluation. This process was
repeated 20 times for a given partition. To test for significance,
we performed a permutation test (Good, 2004) based on 500
permutations (Ojala and Garriga, 2010). To do so, we ran-
domly exchanged the labels for the data (on or off) and used
the shuffled labels to train and evaluate a classifier following
the same procedure we used on the original data. The P-value
was calculated as the sum of all accuracies obtained from the
permuted data that were equal to or higher than the accuracies
obtained from the original (i.e. non-permuted) data, divided by
the number of permutations (Noirhomme et al., 2014). We
considered a patient to have a positive EEG response if
P 5 0.05 (see Supplementary material for additional details).
Definitions of cognitive and higher-
order cortex motor dissociation
We applied Schiff’s definition of CMD (Schiff, 2015) to ICU
patients with acute severe TBI. Specifically, a patient with a
behavioural diagnosis of coma, vegetative state, or MCS� who
demonstrates command-following on functional MRI or EEG
meets criteria for CMD. However, based on unique ICU chal-
lenges (e.g. pharmacological sedation and arousal fluctuations
due to metabolic abnormalities, infections, endocrinological
derangements,
and/or
medication
effects)
(Posner
et
al.,
2007), and based on prior functional MRI and EEG studies
suggesting that responses to passive stimuli have prognostic
relevance in patients with subacute (Fischer et al., 2004) and
chronic disorders of consciousness (Di et al., 2007; Coleman
et al., 2009), we also aimed to identify patients with acute
disorders
of consciousness
who
demonstrated
concordant
EEG and association cortex functional MRI responses during
passive
stimulation,
despite
absent
language
function
on
behavioural evaluation. Importantly, association cortex re-
sponses to passive stimuli are not interpreted as evidence of
covert consciousness, or CMD (see ‘Discussion’ section).
Nevertheless, an association cortex response to language or
music stimuli in a patient whose CRS-R exam indicates
coma, vegetative state, or MCS� still represents a dissociation
between the functional MRI/EEG findings and behavioural
findings. Thus, we classify these patients as having HMD.
See Fig. 2 for a schematic overview of the prespecified criteria
for CMD and HMD.
We implemented several procedures to reduce the FPR of
CMD and HMD detection. First, the binary categorization
of functional MRI responses was based on an objective
marker (i.e. presence or absence of suprathreshold voxels)
rather than subjective visual inspection of the data. Likewise,
EEG responses were categorized using an objective, data-
driven classifier method. Second, for the diagnosis of HMD,
we required that a functional MRI response occur within as-
sociation cortices (e.g. Wernicke’s area), not just primary sen-
sory cortices (Heschl’s gyrus). Third, for a diagnosis of HMD
we required the presence of both functional MRI and EEG
responses to language or music. Collectively, these methods
ensured that patients who met the prespecified criteria have
a high likelihood of consciousness (i.e. CMD) or higher-
order cortical responses to environmental stimuli (i.e. HMD).
Statistical analyses
To assess the reliability of each paradigm to detect behavioural
evidence of language function, we calculated the true positive
rate (TPR; i.e. sensitivity), true negative rate (TNR; i.e. speci-
ficity), false negative rate (FNR) and the FPR in the patient
cohort. The CRS-R-derived behavioural diagnosis was the ref-
erence standard for language function and the stimulus-based
functional MRI or EEG responses were the test criterion.
Notably, the FPR may include both false positives (i.e. patients
wrongly diagnosed by the functional MRI/EEG tests) and cases
of dissociation between behavioural responses and functional
MRI/EEG responses (i.e. CMD or HMD). We also calculated
the TPR and FNR in the healthy subject cohort. TNR and FPR
values were not calculated because all healthy subjects ex-
hibited behavioural evidence of language function.
To test our hypothesis pertaining to the association between
6-month ordinal GOSE scores and early functional MRI and
EEG responses, Mann-Whitney statistics were calculated to
investigate the difference between GOSE scores of patients
with and without responses to each paradigm and considered
significant at P 5 0.05 (two-sided). Several post hoc analyses

 were conducted to assess for potential confounding. To test the
relationship between time from injury to functional MRI/EEG
and responses to the paradigms, we calculated Mann-Whitney
statistics with time post-injury as a continuous predictor and
response as a dichotomous outcome. We assessed the impact
of sedation on functional MRI and EEG responses by classify-
ing sedation in four categories: (i) no sedation; (ii) intermittent
doses of non-anaesthetic sedatives; (iii) continuous infusion of
low-dose
anaesthetic
sedatives
(e.g.
propofol
drip
rate
5150 mg/h); and (iv) continuous infusion of high-dose anaes-
thetic sedatives (e.g. propofol drip rate 5150 mg/h). We tested
for an association between sedation category and functional
MRI/EEG responses, as well as between sedation category
and level of consciousness at the time of functional MRI/
EEG (dichotomized as presence or absence of language func-
tion), using a 4 � 2 Fisher’s exact test (one-sided). Statistical
analyses were performed in SPSS v24.0.
Results

characteristics
Of 399 patients consecutively screened for eligibility, 28
patients with severe TBI met all eligibility criteria and 16
[12 males, mean � standard deviation (SD) age = 28.9 �
9.2 years] were enrolled (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig.
4). At the time of functional MRI (mean � SD post-injury
Day 9.2 � 5.0), behavioural examination indicated coma
(n = 2), vegetative state (n = 3), MCS� (n = 3), MCS +
(n = 4) or PTCS (n = 4). EEG was performed within 24 h
of functional MRI in 11 patients. However, scheduling and
ICU issues (e.g. urgent therapeutic interventions) led to an
increased time between the two assessments for five pa-
tients (range: �7 to + 3 days between functional MRI
and EEG). There was no association between functional
MRI/EEG responses and time post-injury (U = 10–11.5,
P = 0.08–0.88). Sedation category was not associated with
functional MRI/EEG responses or level of consciousness at
the time of functional MRI/EEG (Fisher’s exact test, df = 3;
P = 0.30–0.99 for both analyses). The types and doses of
sedative, anxiolytic, and analgesic medications administered
at the time of functional MRI and EEG are reported in
Supplementary Table 4. Patient-specific data regarding epi-
leptiform activity are reported in the Supplementary mater-
ial and Supplementary Table 5. There were no adverse
events. The healthy subject cohort was composed of 16
healthy subjects (12 males, mean � SD age 28.5 � 7.8
years).
Stimulus-based functional MRI
assessment of brain responses
Functional MRI was completed in 93.7% (music and
motor imagery) to 100% (language) of patients. The
normal range (2.5th to 97.5th percentile) in the healthy
subject cohort for the percentage of activated voxels
within each region of interest for each paradigm is reported
in Supplementary Table 3 and subject-specific functional
MRI
responses
are
shown
in
Supplementary
Fig.
5.
Patients’ individual functional MRI responses are reported
in Table 2 and Supplementary Table 6, and shown in
Supplementary Fig. 6. For all patients with region of
Figure 2 Schematic of the three dimensions of detecting
consciousness. Patients were assessed for motor function and
overt cognitive function via bedside behavioural evaluation with the
CRS-R and CAP. Covert cognition that evades detection by behav-
ioural evaluation was assessed with functional MRI (fMRI) and EEG.
Levels of consciousness indicated by overt cognition are defined as
coma, vegetative state (VS), minimally conscious state without lan-
guage function (MCS�), minimally conscious state with language
function (MCS + ), post-traumatic confusional state (PTCS), com-
plete locked-in syndrome (CLIS), locked-in syndrome with preser-
vation of minimal motor function (LIS), and full recovery. Cognitive
motor dissociation (CMD) is defined by functional MRI or EEG
responses demonstrating command-following on an active motor
imagery task despite absence of behavioural evidence of language
function. Higher-order cortex motor dissociation (HMD) is defined
as functional MRI and EEG responses within association cortex (e.g.
Wernicke’s area) during passive language or music stimuli despite
absence of behavioural evidence of language. Using the behavioural
diagnosis as the reference standard, patients without behavioural
evidence of language (coma, vegetative state, and MCS�) are clas-
sified as true negatives (TN) if there are no functional MRI or EEG
responses. Patients with behavioural evidence of language [MCS + ,
PTCS, CLIS (with assistive communication devices), LIS, and full
recovery] are classified as false negatives (FN) if there are no
functional MRI or EEG responses, and true positives (TP) if there
are functional MRI and EEG responses.

 interest-specific functional MRI activation, the percentage
of activated voxels was above the lower limit of the
normal range in controls.
Language
All 16 healthy subjects [100% (95% exact confidence inter-
val
(CI):
79.4–100%)]
demonstrated
responses
within
Heschl’s gyrus and superior temporal gyrus. Of the eight
patients with behavioural evidence of language function,
five had a functional MRI response to language (TPR = 5/8;
FNR = 3/8). Of the eight patients without behavioural signs
of language, three had no functional MRI response to lan-
guage (TNR = 3/8; FPR = 5/8). The sensitivity and specificity
of language functional MRI for behavioural evidence of lan-
guage in patients was thus 62.5% (95% CI: 24.5–91.5%)
and 37.5% (95% CI: 8.5–75.5%), respectively. In the ana-
lysis of forwards versus backwards language responses, 9 of
16 healthy subjects and 6 of 16 patients demonstrated more
superior temporal gyrus activation to forwards language (see
Supplementary Tables 3 and 6 for subject-specific data).
Greater superior temporal gyrus activation to forwards lan-
guage was 50% (95% CI: 15.7–84.3%) sensitive and 62.5%
(95% CI: 24.5–91.5%) specific for behavioural evidence of
language in patients.
Music
Fifteen of 16 healthy subjects [93.8% (95% CI: 69.8–
99.8%)] demonstrated responses within Heschl’s gyrus
and superior temporal gyrus. Of the seven patients with
behavioural evidence of language function, five displayed a
functional MRI response to music (TPR = 5/7; FNR = 2/7).
Of the eight patients without behavioural evidence of lan-
guage, three responded to music (TNR = 5/8; FPR = 3/8). In
patients, functional MRI response to music was thus 71.4%
(95% CI: 29.0–96.3%) sensitive and 62.5% (95% CI:
24.5–91.5%) specific for behavioural evidence of language.
Motor imagery
Eleven of 16 healthy subjects [68.8% (95% CI: 41.3–
89.0%)]
demonstrated
responses
within
supplementary
motor areas/premotor cortices. Of the seven patients with
behavioural evidence of language, three showed functional
MRI evidence of command-following (TPR = 3/7; FNR = 4/
7). Of the eight patients without behavioural evidence of
language, four showed functional MRI evidence of com-
mand-following (TNR = 4/8; FPR = 4/8). Functional MRI
responses to motor imagery were thus 42.9% (95% CI:
9.9–81.6%) sensitive and 50% (95% CI: 15.7–84.3%) spe-
cific for behavioural evidence of language in patients.
Stimulus-based EEG assessment of
brain responses
EEG was completed in 86.6% (music and motor imagery)
to 93.3% (language) of patients. The percentage of EEG
data discarded due to artefact was 1.2 � 1.7% for healthy
subjects and 1.7 � 3.8% for patients. Patient and healthy

The initial Glasgow Coma Scale (iGCS) is defined as the best (i.e. highest) and worst (i.e. lowest) post-resuscitation GCS score assessed by a qualified clinician who performed a
reliable examination (not confounded by sedation and/or paralytics) prior to ICU admission. Level of consciousness (LoC) is assessed via behavioural evaluation with the CRS-R as
coma, vegetative state (VS), MCS�, MCS + , or PTCS (emerged from MCS but disoriented). The subscales for the CRS-R are Auditory Function (A), Visual Function (V), Motor
Function (M), Oromotor Function (O), Communication (C), and Arousal (Ar).

 subject group-level EEG responses are summarized below.
Single-subject EEG responses are reported in Table 2 and
Supplementary Table 6 for patients and Supplementary
Table 3 for healthy subjects.
Language
Fourteen of 16 healthy subjects had EEG responses to lan-
guage [87.5% (95% CI: 61.7–98.4%)]. Of the 10 patients
with behavioural evidence of language function, eight had
EEG responses to language (TPR = 8/10; FNR = 2/10). Of
the four patients without behavioural signs of language,
three
had
no
EEG
response
to
language
(TNR = 3/4;
FPR = 1/4). EEG response to language was thus 80% (95%
CI: 44.4–97.5%) sensitive and 75% (95% CI: 19.4–99.4%)
specific for detecting behavioural signs of language in patients.
Music
Fourteen of 16 healthy subjects had EEG responses to music
[87.5% (95% CI: 61.7–98.4%)]. Of the nine patients with
behavioural evidence of language function, six had EEG re-
sponses to music (TPR = 6/9; FNR = 3/9). Of the four pa-
tients without behavioural evidence of language, two had no
EEG response to music (TNR = 2/4; FPR = 2/4). EEG re-
sponse to music was thus 66.7% (95% CI: 29.9–92.5%)
sensitive and 50% (95% CI: 6.8–93.2%) specific for detect-
ing behavioural evidence of language in patients.
Motor imagery
Twelve of 16 healthy subjects had EEG responses to motor im-
agery [75.0% (95% CI: 47.6–92.7%)]. Of the nine patients with
behavioural evidence of language function, three had EEG re-
sponses to motor imagery (TPR = 3/9; FNR = 6/9). Of the four
patientswithoutbehaviouralevidenceoflanguage,nonehadEEG
response to motor imagery (TNR = 4/4; FPR = 0/4). EEG re-
sponse to motor imagery was thus 33.3% (95% CI: 7.5–
70.1%) sensitive and 100% (95% CI: 39.8–100%) specific for
detecting behavioural signs of language in patients.
Detection of covert command-
following and higher-order cortical
responses
CMD was identified by functional MRI in four of eight
patients who did not have behavioural evidence of lan-
guage function (three vegetative state, one MCS�). HMD
was identified in two additional patients who had both
functional MRI and EEG responses to passive stimuli
(both MCS�). Figure 3 shows representative functional
MRI and EEG responses for a healthy subject, a patient
with behavioural and functional MRI/EEG evidence of lan-
guage function, a patient with CMD, a patient with HMD,
and a patient without behavioural or functional MRI/EEG
evidence of language function. Figure 4 shows an EEG

Two patients died in the ICU (GOSE = 1) after withholding
life-sustaining therapy. One patient (Patient P12) died 5
days after functional MRI and EEG. One patient (Patient
P14) died 2 days after functional MRI, before EEG data
could be acquired. For the 14 patients who survived,
follow-up
GOSE
evaluation
was
performed
in-person
(n = 11) or via phone interview (n = 3) at mean � SD
6.2 � 0.9 months post-injury. GOSE scores ranged from
1 (death) to 7 (lower good recovery) (median 5.0; see
Table 2). Follow-up level of consciousness data were avail-
able for all 14 survivors (eight via in-person CRS-R/CAP
assessment and six via CRS-R/CAP data obtained from
clinical records). All survivors, including the three survivors
of acute CMD and both patients with acute HMD, re-
covered beyond PTCS by 6 months. Highest acute level
of consciousness based on the CRS-R score at the time of
functional MRI or EEG was 64% (95% CI: 35.1–87.2%)
sensitive for detecting recovery beyond PTCS by 6 months.

the language, music and motor imagery paradigms for representative subjects: a healthy subject (C2), a patient with behavioural and functional
MRI/EEG evidence of language function (Patient P9), a patient with no behavioural evidence of language but functional MRI evidence of command-
following (CMD; Patient P6), a patient with no behavioural evidence of language but functional MRI/EEG evidence of cortical activation to passive
stimuli (HMD; Patient P2), and a patient without behavioural or functional MRI/EEG evidence of language (Patient P3). Functional MRI data are
shown as Z-statistic images to demonstrate stimulus-specific responses. Z-statistic images are thresholded at cluster-corrected Z scores of 3.1
(inset colour bar) and superimposed on T1-weighted axial images. All EEG data are shown as topographic plots illustrating the averaged weights
attributed to each electrode by the classifier, based on their ability to differentiate between the two conditions for each paradigm (e.g. language
versus rest). Red colours show coefficient values 4 0. Blue colours show values 5 0 (inset colour bar). The larger the absolute value of a feature
weight (either positive or negative), the more important it was for discriminating between stimulus and rest conditions. Functional MRI data are in
radiological convention; EEG data are in anatomical convention.

Similarly,
GOSE
scores were not higher for patients who had more func-
tional MRI activation to forwards language versus back-
wards language (U = 27.0, P = 0.68).
Discussion
In this prospective study of patients with acute severe TBI,
we demonstrate that it is feasible to use stimulus-based
functional MRI and EEG in the ICU to identify covert
consciousness that evades detection on bedside behavioural
examination. We identified a substantial proportion of ICU
patients whose functional MRI and EEG responses revealed
either command-following (CMD) or higher-order cortical
responses to passive stimuli (HMD) despite a behavioural
diagnosis of vegetative state or MCS�. Of the eight pa-
tients who lacked behavioural evidence of language func-
tion (two coma, three vegetative state, and three MCS�),
four demonstrated functional MRI responses consistent
with
command
following
(three
vegetative
state,
one
MCS�) and two patients without evidence of command
following showed higher-order cortical responses to lan-
guage and/or music on both functional MRI and EEG
(two MCS�).
Our observations in ICU patients with acute severe TBI
are consistent with and build upon those of prior functional
MRI and EEG studies in patients with chronic disorders of
consciousness that reported CMD rates ranging from 8%
(Lule et al., 2013) to 45% (Hauger et al., 2015). Similarly,
the proportion of ICU patients in this study that met cri-
teria for HMD is consistent with proportions of patients
with chronic disorders of consciousness who respond to
passive
event-related
potential
paradigms
(14–33%)
(Faugeras et al., 2011; King et al., 2013; Sitt et al.,
2014). Yet while all three acute CMD survivors and both
acute HMD patients in our study recovered beyond PTCS
Figure 4 EEG classifier results in HMD. For a patient who met the prespecified criteria for HMD (P2), we show spectral power changes
during the language paradigm for the eight electrodes with the largest weights (i.e. the electrodes that best discriminated between language and
rest; see inset colour bar). A decrement in delta power was observed at each electrode [units = 10log(mV2/Hz)], with a more pronounced change
in the left hemisphere in the temporal region known to be involved in language processing (electrode T3). For electrode F7, the decrement in
delta power was 11.7 microvolts. d = delta; t = theta; a = alpha; b = beta. The overall P-value in this analysis was P = 0.01.

 by 6 months post-injury, we did not detect an association
between 6-month functional outcomes on the GOSE and
early functional MRI and EEG responses.
Collectively, these findings suggest that (i) stimulus-based
functional MRI can detect CMD in the ICU when an active
motor imagery task is used; and (ii) functional MRI and
EEG techniques using passive language and music stimuli
enable detection of higher-order cortex responses in pa-
tients without behavioural evidence of language function.
Confirmation of the clinical relevance of a response to a
passive stimulus awaits corroborating diagnostic and/or
prognostic evidence. Below we discuss our findings in
terms of their clinical, scientific, and ethical significance
for the ICU population.
Rationale for stimulus-based
functional MRI and EEG in the ICU
The motivation to develop quantitative, stimulus-based
functional MRI and EEG biomarkers in the ICU is based
on several challenges that currently limit the accuracy of
diagnosis and prognosis in patients with acute brain inju-
ries.
First,
the
alarmingly
high
rate
of
misdiagnosis
observed in the vegetative state population (�40%) when
using clinical consensus rather than a CRS-R evaluation
(Schnakers et al., 2009) is particularly concerning in the
ICU, because patients often cannot tolerate being off
pharmacological sedation for the 15–35 min required to
perform the CRS-R. Additionally, the CRS-R behavioural
examination can be limited by motor deficits, aphasia
(Majerus et al., 2009), fluctuating vigilance (Piarulli et al.,
2016), or sensory impairment that may be unrecognized
during the acute stage of injury in the ICU. Examiner
bias inherent to interpreting behavioural responses further
contributes to the potential failure to detect consciousness.
Given prior evidence that conscious patients (i.e. MCS)
have a better prognosis than unconscious patients (i.e.
coma and vegetative state) (Giacino and Kalmar, 1997;
Katz et al., 2009; Luaute et al., 2010; Bruno et al.,
2012a; Whyte et al., 2013), early diagnosis (and its corres-
ponding prognosis) can drive decisions regarding discon-
tinuation of life-sustaining treatment (Truog et al., 2008;
Turgeon et al., 2011). Challenges in detecting conscious-
ness in the ICU can potentially lead to early withdrawal
of care in patients who retain sufficient cortical function to
support recovery. Even for patients who are provided
chronic life-sustaining treatment, an inaccurate poor prog-
nosis may limit a patient’s access to intensive rehabilitative
care, leading to a self-fulfilling prophecy whereby the early
prognosis contributes to a patient’s poor outcome.
Defining covert consciousness in ICU
patients
There is ongoing debate about how to define consciousness
in patients who cannot express themselves at the bedside
but who show signs of covert consciousness with functional
MRI or EEG (Ropper, 2010). This debate is underscored
by the many terms, including ‘covert cognition’ (Schnakers
et al., 2015b), ‘functional locked-in syndrome’ (Bruno
et al., 2011), ‘minimally conscious star (*)’ (Gosseries
et al., 2014), and ‘CMD’ (Schiff, 2015) that have been
used to classify these patients. It is now accepted that pa-
tients with CMD should be distinguished from vegetative
state patients, as covert consciousness may carry a more
favourable prognosis (Di et al., 2008; Stender et al.,
2014; Wang et al., 2015). However, consensus criteria

in CMD. Functional MRI data are shown as Z-statistic images to
demonstrate stimulus-specific responses in a patient whose behav-
ioural evaluation suggested a vegetative state (Patient P14). Z-stat-
istic images are thresholded at cluster-corrected Z scores of 3.1
(inset colour bar) and superimposed on T1-weighted axial images.
There is functional MRI evidence of command-following on the
motor imagery task (arrow), indicating CMD. In the bottom panel, a
3D rendering of the functional MRI response to the motor imagery
task is shown (arrow). This response is located within the prespe-
cified supplementary motor area/premotor cortex region of inter-
est. Specifically, the response is located within the premotor cortex
(PMC) in close neuroanatomic proximity to a right frontal contu-
sion. The images in the top row are shown in radiological conven-
tion. Notably, despite functional MRI activation within the superior
temporal gyrus during the language stimulus (top left), the patient
was classified as having an absent response to language because of
the absence of a response within Heschl’s gyrus. Ins = insula;
LV = lateral ventricle.

 for defining consciousness based upon the integrated results
of behavioural, functional MRI and EEG data currently do
not exist.
Recently, it was proposed that a diagnosis of CMD re-
quires functional MRI or EEG-based evidence of com-
mand-following
during
a
motor
imagery
task
(Schiff,
2015). Here, we implemented Schiff’s CMD definition in
the ICU population and used a motor imagery task that
was previously used to detect CMD in patients with
chronic disorders of consciousness (Cruse et al., 2011). In
addition to detecting CMD patients in the ICU, we also
identified a separate group of patients whose responses to
passive stimuli on functional MRI and EEG are greater
than those expected based on behavioural evaluation.
Our motivation for classifying this group as HMD is
based upon diagnostic and prognostic considerations that
are unique to the ICU environment. First, command-follow-
ing may not be the only type of brain activity that is rele-
vant to the diagnosis and prognosis of ICU patients with
acute severe TBI. Rather, higher-order cortex responses to
language and music suggest a residual capacity to process
environmental stimuli and, if corroborated, might also
inform diagnosis and prognosis. Second, requiring com-
mand-following during a motor imagery task may be too
high a bar for defining a clinically meaningful functional
MRI/EEG response in patients with acute severe TBI.
Compared to patients with subacute or chronic disorders
of consciousness, patients with acute disorders of con-
sciousness are more likely to have poor or fluctuating arou-
sal, which decreases the likelihood that a patient can
perform a functional MRI- or EEG-based command-follow-
ing
task.
This
concern
about
the
poor
reliability
of
functional
MRI-
and
EEG-based
command-following
tasks is highlighted by their limited sensitivity in healthy
populations (Hauger et al., 2015), which ranges from
71% to 100% in prior studies (Boly et al., 2007; Bardin
et al., 2012; Hauger et al., 2017). In our sample of 16
healthy subjects, the rates of functional MRI- and EEG-
based command-following during the motor imagery task
were 69% and 75%, respectively. These findings under-
score the need for caution in interpreting negative findings
on functional MRI and EEG motor imagery tasks.
Importantly, we do not to assert that HMD is indicative of
covert consciousness. Current conceptual models of con-
sciousness, such as the global neuronal workspace theory
(Dehaene et al., 2006) and the information integration
theory (Tononi, 2004), propose that consciousness requires
the integrated activity of association cortices. However, such
activation is likely necessary but not sufficient for conscious-
ness. Indeed, prior functional MRI studies have shown that
association cortices respond to passive language stimuli in
healthy humans who are sleeping (Portas et al., 2000) or
undergoing propofol sedation (Davis et al., 2007; Liu et al.,
2012). Moreover, one could argue that an association cortex
response is not only insufficient for consciousness, but also
insufficient proof of a potential for consciousness. A previous
study identified focal regions of association cortex activity
that could represent isolated ‘islands of cortex’ in a patient
with vegetative state (Schiff et al., 1999). This intriguing pos-
sibility of ‘words without mind’ suggests that association
cortex responses may not be a proxy for higher-level cortical
function but rather may be associated with reflexive, non-
purposeful
behaviour
(Fischer
and
Truog,
2015).
Nevertheless, the potential clinical relevance of identifying

 ICU patients with HMD is supported by previous studies
reporting recovery of consciousness in patients with chronic
disorders of consciousness who had higher-order cortex re-
sponses (e.g. Coleman et al., 2009). Ultimately, we expect
that the HMD criteria proposed here will be refined in
future studies. While our multimodal functional MRI and
EEG-based approach strengthens the reliability of an HMD
diagnosis, demonstration of its clinical validity will require
larger longitudinal studies that test its diagnostic and prog-
nostic relevance.
Accuracy of stimulus-based
functional MRI and EEG in the ICU
We observed variable responses to language, music, and
motor imagery stimuli in healthy subjects and in patients
with behavioural evidence of language function (i.e. MCS +
and PTCS). In healthy subjects, functional MRI and EEG
sensitivity was highest for the language paradigm, lower for
music, and lowest for motor imagery. Similar results were
observed in patients, with the highest functional MRI and
EEG sensitivity observed for language, followed by music
and motor imagery. The low sensitivity of our right-hand
squeeze motor imagery paradigm for detecting behavioural
evidence of language supports the need for development of
motor imagery tasks that have lower cognitive demands
and/or tasks whose responses are more robustly detected
by functional MRI and EEG. Passive paradigms that iden-
tify HMD also require further investigation, as they may
provide valuable information when responses to active
tasks are not evident.
Importantly, it is difficult to identify false positive func-
tional MRI and EEG results in this population of patients
for whom there is no definitive gold standard diagnostic
test to define the level of consciousness. Future studies are
needed to develop robust methods for identification of false
positive results, as well as false negative results in patients
receiving sedation. The optimal timing for functional MRI
and EEG data acquisition also remains to be determined, as
the level of consciousness and corresponding cortical func-
tion may fluctuate substantially in acutely brain-injured pa-
tients due to dynamic pathophysiological processes such as
intracranial hypertension, cerebral oedema, and mass effect.
Prognostic value of stimulus-based
functional MRI and EEG in the ICU
GOSE scores did not differ between patients with or with-
out functional MRI and EEG responses in the ICU. This
result does not support findings from previous studies
showing that patients with subacute or chronic disorders
of consciousness who have functional MRI evidence of
covert consciousness had better long-term recovery (Di
et al., 2008; Coleman et al., 2009). Although recovery
from PTCS was evident in all 14 survivors at 6 months
post-injury, it is notable that this group included three
patients with acute CMD and two with HMD. Many fac-
tors influence recovery in patients with acute severe TBI,
but it is possible that early cortical responses detected by
functional MRI and EEG in these five patients contributed
to the emergence of behavioural signs of consciousness.
Even if cortical responses to passive stimuli in HMD pa-
tients are conservatively interpreted as disconnected islands
of cortex, the subsequent recovery of self-expression and
comprehension suggests that part of the neuronal architec-
ture capable of supporting consciousness may have been
present acutely. On the other hand, the observation that
one comatose subject with no evidence of CMD or HMD
also recovered from PTCS supports the notion that prog-
nosis should not be based upon negative findings from
these techniques.
Limitations and methodological
considerations
Although our 16-patient sample was the largest to date that
has been studied with stimulus-based functional MRI and
EEG in the ICU (Edlow et al., 2013), because our study
was designed to determine the feasibility of detecting CMD
and HMD in an ICU population, the sample size was likely
too small to demonstrate the prognostic utility of these
techniques. In addition, our findings were likely con-
founded by variables inherent to the ICU environment.
First, individual patient responses may have been affected
by sedation, even if there was no statistically significant
association between level of sedation (analysed as an or-
dinal variable) and functional MRI or EEG responses for
the entire cohort. It was not possible to use a more granu-
lar approach to assess the effect of sedatives on cortical
responses (i.e. analysing sedation as a continuous variable),
because many patients received multiple sedatives for which
equivalencies have not been established, the effect of seda-
tives on cortical responses may vary with hepatic and renal
metabolism, and standardized sedation rating scales that
have been validated in non-brain injured ICU patients
(Sessler et al., 2002) are not necessarily applicable to
brain-injured
patients
(Roberts
et
al.,
2011).
Second,
acute fluctuations in arousal that are common in the ICU
may have caused inconsistent responses (Piarulli et al.,
2016). For example, functional MRI responses to the
active motor imagery task but not the passive language
stimulus were observed in Patients P5 and P14. Third,
while we chose the GOSE score as our outcome measure
based on its widespread use in severe TBI studies (Bagiella
et al., 2010), the GOSE lacks sensitivity for targeting brain
injury-related impairments. In addition, all surviving pa-
tients recovered beyond PTCS, making specificity analysis
of functional MRI/EEG combined with CRS-R/CAP for
predicting 6-month level of consciousness not possible in
this study. Future studies investigating the prognostic utility
of functional MRI and EEG in the ICU will therefore

 require larger sample sizes and will need to consider alter-
native functional outcomes measures.
It should also be noted that because of feasibility consid-
erations, the early behavioural evaluations, follow-up as-
sessments,
and
functional
MRI
analyses
were
not
performed by independent investigators in this study.
Nevertheless, our implementation of quantitative, unbiased
methods for functional MRI analysis and CMD/HMD de-
tection mitigates this limitation. To reduce the FPR, we also
required that positive functional MRI responses in patients
were above the lower limit of a normal range of functional
MRI activation derived from matched healthy subjects, and
that both functional MRI and EEG evidence of higher-
order cortical processing were evident for HMD classifica-
tion. With regard to generalizability, our EEG classifier is
built on single-subject data, making it ideally suited for
severe TBI patients with variable types and locations of
brain lesions, but potentially limiting its generalizability
across subjects.
Ethical considerations
Diagnostic studies of consciousness that use advanced, in-
vestigational techniques in the acute disorders of conscious-
ness population raise challenging ethical questions. First,
the field has not developed a systematic way to interpret
negative findings. The absence of functional MRI and EEG
responses does not necessarily indicate absence of con-
sciousness, especially considering that �25% of healthy
subjects do not demonstrate responses in the expected
brain
regions
when
performing
motor
imagery
tasks.
Second, despite extensive efforts to reduce false positives,
functional MRI and EEG may suggest preserved conscious-
ness in patients who are actually unconscious. Should these
advanced methods be incorporated into clinical practice,
clinicians will require training on how to interpret negative
and positive findings in the context of the limited sensitivity
and specificity of these methods.
Ultimately, we anticipate that this study and others like it
will
encourage
open
dialogue
between
clinicians
and
families about the uncertainty of prognostication and the
limitations of different assessment tools (Fins, 2015). We
further emphasize that the methods described here are in-
vestigational and will need to be tested across multiple sites
and settings before becoming integrated into clinical care.
Finally, we acknowledge that access to advanced tech-
niques, such as those presented here, is currently limited
to hospitals with specific technical expertise and infrastruc-
ture. However, we are confident that, if these tools are
validated, their potential benefit to patients and families
will encourage dissemination of standardized acquisition
protocols and analysis pipelines that meet the needs of
community
medical
centres.
Stimulus-based
functional
MRI and EEG methods should be refined to produce
streamlined, timely, and intuitive outputs that can be inter-
preted by a clinician.
Conclusions
Stimulus-based functional MRI can provide evidence of
consciousness that evades detection by bedside examination
in ICU patients with acute severe TBI. In addition, a subset
of ICU patients exists whose higher-order cortex responses
on functional MRI and EEG are greater than those sug-
gested by the bedside examination. Multimodal assessment
with the CRS-R, stimulus-based functional MRI and EEG
may provide a more robust evaluation of consciousness and
higher-order cortical function than bedside examination
alone. If these findings are validated in future studies,
stimulus-based functional MRI and EEG may enable ICU
clinicians to render more accurate prognoses and help
families make informed decisions about continuation of
life-sustaining therapies.
