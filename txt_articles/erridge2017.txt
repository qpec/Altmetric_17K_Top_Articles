Background: Eye tracking presents a novel tool that could be used to profile skill levels in surgery
objectively. The primary aim of this study was to identify differences in gaze behaviour between expert
and junior surgeons performing a laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) for obesity.
Methods: This prospective observational study used a lightweight eye-tracking apparatus to determine
the difference in gaze behaviours between expert (more than 75 procedures) and junior (75 or fewer
procedures) surgeons at defined stages of LRYGB. Primary endpoints were normalized dwell time and
fixation frequency. Secondary endpoints were blink rate, maximum pupil size and rate of pupil change.
Results: A total of 20 procedures (12 junior, 8 expert) were analysed. Compared with juniors, experts
showed a prolonged dwell time on the screen during angle of His dissection (median (range) 91⋅20
(83⋅40–94⋅40) versus 68⋅95 (59⋅80–87⋅60) per cent; P = 0⋅001), formation of the retrogastric tunnel
(91⋅50 (85⋅80–95⋅50) versus 73⋅60 (34⋅60–90⋅50) per cent; P = 0⋅001) and gastric pouch formation (86⋅95
(83⋅60–90⋅20) versus 67⋅60 (37⋅10–80⋅00) per cent P < 0⋅001). Juniors had a greater blink frequency
throughout all recorded segments (P < 0⋅010) and had a larger maximum pupil size during all recorded
operative segments (P < 0⋅010). Rate of pupil change was greater in juniors in all analysed segments
(P < 0⋅010).
Conclusion: These results suggest that experts display more focused attention on significant stimuli,
alongside experiencing a reduced mental workload and having increased concentration. This has the
potential for future use in validation of surgical skill in high-stakes assessment.

Introduction
Bariatric surgery is an effective method of treating
the sequelae of obesity compared with non-operative
approaches1.
Laparoscopic
Roux-en-Y
gastric
bypass
(LRYGB) has been shown to be effective in the treatment
of type 2 diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidaemia2–4.
Although there is a clear need for an increased number
of surgeons who can perform LRYGB, it has a significant
risk of complications; Li and colleagues3 reported a rate
of 19⋅88 per cent in 3874 procedures. Birkmeyer and
co-workers5 have previously demonstrated a correlation
between surgical skill, operative outcomes and case vol-
ume. There is a need for competent surgeons to be trained
and subsequently validated in their skill via novel methods.
Eye tracking utilizes infrared lights in combination with
cameras to map the user’
s point of focus on to their field of
view6. The study of gaze behaviours with eye tracking has
been shown to be of benefit in both training and validating
surgical skill7–10.
Gaze training is of use in training surgeons for orienta-
tion during laparoscopic procedures by identifying regions
of interest7. It has also been shown to improve the effi-
ciency of laparoscopic tasks either by verbally informing
trainees as to regions of interest on which they should
focus8 or via mapping the region of interest from a trainer
on to the screen to guide a trainee9.
Currently, validation of surgeons in the UK does not
require any formal assessment of surgical skills. Scoring
systems have been developed, but there are limitations

to their use during procedures. Objective assessments,
such as the Objective Structured Assessment of T
echni-
cal Skills (OSATS) scale, although useful for formative
assessment of skills during LRYGB, are time-intensive to
undertake11,
12. Motion analysis devices have been validated
as bench-side models for assessing laparoscopic skill13,
including LRYGB14, but are yet to be validated for use in
determining skill during surgery.
Eye tracking has previously been used as an assessment
tool in simulated environments6,
15,
16. The potential for
eye tracking to identify significant differences in the gaze
behaviour between expert and novice surgeons performing
an open inguinal hernia repair has been reported10. The
present study evaluated gaze behaviour for a laparoscopic
procedure. The aim was to identify differences between
expert and junior surgeons during laparoscopic gastric
bypass.
Methods
This prospective observational study was conducted at the
Imperial Weight Centre, St Mary’
s Hospital, London, UK.
It was performed under ethical approval from the West
London and GTAC Research Ethics Committee.
Patients
All laparoscopic gastric bypass procedures carried out
between February and May 2016 were considered for
inclusion in this study, including LRYGB and mini gas-
tric bypass (MGB), subject to acquisition of consent.
All surgeons capable of performing a bypass as the pri-
mary surgeon, who were comfortable with and able to
wear eye-tracking glasses, were invited to take part. The
patient cohort included those deemed eligible for a gastric
bypass procedure after consultation at the Imperial Weight
Centre17. Patients who had undergone previous bariatric
surgery were excluded. Patient demographics including
sex, BMI and ASA grade were recorded. Additionally, the
surgeon’
s training grade and how many previous LRYGBs
they had done were recorded, alongside the training grade
of the surgical assistant.
Consent
Informed consent was obtained from both surgeons and
patients on admission, with the option to withdraw from
the study at any point. The consenting process was mod-
ified during the study, to include showing patients the
eye-tracking apparatus, in response to feedback question-
naires to improve patient involvement18.
Data recording
Surgeons wore a pair of lightweight eye-tracking glasses
(model 1.4; SensoMotoric Instruments, T
eltow, Germany)
while performing the procedures. The iView software
(SensoMotoric Instruments) on the glasses collects eye
movement and metrics, which are transmitted via a cable
into a portable recording device beneath the surgeon’
s
gown. The glasses incorporate a forward-facing scene cam-
era, which records the participant’
s field of view. The
glasses additionally utilize dark pupil tracking to record eye
movement19,
20. One-point calibration is carried out before
the procedure to allow for integration of pupil positioning
within the field of view. The glasses provide a binocular
sampling rate of 30 Hz. The accuracy of the pupil position-
ing is within 0⋅5∘ in all directions, with a spatial resolution
of 0⋅1∘. The glasses are able to track within a range of 80∘
and 60∘ across the horizontal and vertical axes respectively.
Intraoperative training of the operating surgeon was kept
to a minimum, unless this would impact adversely on
patient safety. During data collection, a researcher was
present constantly to assess distractions unrelated to the
surgical procedure; these were removed subsequently at
analysis.
Procedure
The Imperial Weight Centre conducts LRYGB in a stan-
dard manner, with only minor deviation in instrumenta-
tion used between surgeons. The steps of the procedure
analysed in this study were: preoperative set-up including
port placement and liver retraction (segment 1); dissection
of the angle of His (segment 2); formation of the retro-
gastric tunnel (segment 3); and construction of the gastric
pouch (segment 4). The inclusion of the final segment of
the operation reflects its significance as a critical step in
LRYGB21,
22.
Assessment
Areas of interest (AOIs) were determined before data anal-
ysis (Table 1). The primary study outcome parameters were
fixation frequency and gaze duration. Fixation frequency
was defined as the number of fixations on an AOI per sec-
ond. Gaze duration is the cumulative duration of all fixa-
tions on an AOI, including short saccades. The secondary
parameters analysed were maximum pupil size, pupil rate
of change and blink rate. The maximum pupil size is the
maximum diameter of the pupil (mm) whilst engaging with
the task. Pupil rate of change describes the frequency in the
change in diameter of the pupil (mm/s). Blink rate (count/s)

Using the videos created by the glasses, subjects’fields
of view were analysed manually via semantic gaze map-
ping. Eye metrics were subsequently determined from this
with respect to the AOIs. All extraneous distractions and
segments unrelated to the procedure were omitted from
analysis.
Surgeons were distributed into expert (more than 75
procedures) and junior (75 or fewer procedures) cohorts
dependent on the number of LRYGB procedures they
had performed previously. This cut-off was determined
based on evidence from a number of studies that define
the learning curve for LRYGB as between 75 and 100
procedures23–25.
After completion of the procedure, surgeons were asked
to identify the difficulty of the recorded segment on a
7-point Likert scale, in order to compare the difficulty of
procedure carried out by each cohort.
Analysis
The recorded portion was divided into separate sections
to account for technical nuances between sections, as well
as variance in anatomy. Segmental procedure analysis was
used to overcome this. The segments analysed included the
four stages described above.
A single individual, who had received appropriate train-
ing to ensure consistency in semantic gaze analysis, anal-
ysed all videos. The videos were calibrated to a set view-
point on which the subject had focused their gaze before
analysis. The primary outcomes of dwell time (per cent)
and fixation frequency (count/s) were computed according
to the stated AOIs, whereas the secondary outcomes were
calculated across the segment.

Previous studies6,
26 have shown the comparison of
gaze behaviours between subjects of varying experience
to be non-parametric. This data set was additionally
confirmed to be non-parametric via a Shapiro–Wilk
test. Junior–expert analysis was carried out using a
one-tailed Mann–Whitney U test. Demographic data
for junior and expert surgeons were compared with
a t test when parametric and the Mann–Whitney U
test when non-parametric. All statistical tests were car-
ried out using SPSS® version 22.0.0.0 (IBM, Armonk,
New York, USA). The significance level was set at
P < 0⋅050.
Results
A total of 23 procedures were recorded for the purpose
of analysis. Of these, three (all junior surgeons) were con-
verted to a sleeve gastrectomy owing to insufficient bowel
length to form a Roux limb. As such they were removed
from analysis for all segments apart from segment 1, as
the set-up phase is identical. One expert and two junior
data sets were excluded from analysis of segment 1 (fail-
ure of equipment, 1; subject refusal to record data on that
segment, 2).

versus 0⋅11 (0⋅09–0⋅15) mm/s; P = 0⋅001).
Segment 3: retrogastric tunnel formation
In segment 3, experts had a longer dwell time on the screen
compared with juniors (median 91⋅50 (range 85⋅80–95⋅50)
versus 73⋅60 (34⋅60–90⋅50) per cent respectively; P = 0⋅001)
(Fig. S3, supporting information). Juniors had a greater fix-
ation frequency on the operating theatre (0⋅01 (0⋅00–0⋅16)
per s versus 0⋅00 (0⋅00–0⋅04) per s for experts; P = 0⋅017).
Additionally, juniors had an increased fixation frequency
on the scrub nurse (0⋅01 (0⋅00–0⋅06) per s versus 0⋅00
(0⋅00–0⋅00) per s for experts; P = 0⋅011).
Similar to previous segments, juniors had an increased
blink rate (median 0⋅55 (range 0⋅20–2⋅00) per s versus
0⋅10 (0⋅10–0⋅20) per s for experts; P < 0⋅001), a greater
maximum pupil size (5⋅20 (3⋅40–7⋅00) mm versus 3⋅75
(2⋅60–4⋅10) mm for experts; P = 0⋅001) and greater rate
of pupil change (0⋅23 (0⋅15–1⋅11) versus 0⋅12 (0⋅07–0⋅17)
mm/s respectively; P < 0⋅001).
Segment 4: gastric pouch formation
Throughout segment 4 experts had a longer normalized
dwell time on the screen compared with juniors (median
86⋅95 (83⋅60–90⋅20) versus 67⋅60 (37⋅10–80⋅00) per cent
respectively; P < 0⋅001) (Fig. S4, supporting information).
Juniors had a larger fixation frequency on the operative
field (0⋅05 (0⋅02–0⋅12) per s versus 0⋅03 (0⋅02–0⋅05) per s
for experts; P = 0⋅011).
Juniors again had a more frequent blink rate (median
0⋅95 (range 0⋅30–1⋅90) per s versus 0⋅20 (0⋅10–0⋅20) per s
for experts; P < 0⋅001). They also had a larger maximum
pupil size (5⋅30 (3⋅70–6⋅80) versus 3⋅70 (2⋅80–4⋅40) mm
respectively; P = 0⋅001) and rate of pupil change (0⋅26
(0⋅12–1⋅22) versus 0⋅11 (0⋅01–0⋅15) per s; P = 0⋅001).
Discussion
This study was able to distinguish between surgeons’skill
level in critical segments of live laparoscopic surgery using
eye-tracking technology. It suggests a potential for eye
tracking to be used as a tool to provide objective assessment
of surgical performance. It could be used as a training
tool in LRYGB, and indeed the wider field of laparoscopic
surgery. The key finding of this study is the ability to
distinguish between junior and expert surgeons with regard
to dwell times and fixation frequency at each operative
segment assessed, in addition to blink rate, maximum pupil
diameter and rate of pupil change.
A high dwell time is understood to be a measure of
higher cognitive attention, by ignoring potentially distract-
ing stimuli to focus on the given task27,
28. This study shows
that expert surgeons had a significantly higher dwell time
on the operative field in the preoperative segment and on
the screen in all segments. This demonstrates the experts’

ability to concentrate on the most crucial aspect of the
operation. This may be a result of an accumulation of
knowledge over a number of procedures, which leads them
to have higher concentration, or this may be a result of a
more economical range of eye movements, again as a result
of their experience.
Fixation frequency can be used to demonstrate which
AOIs are of most importance to the surgeon. Through-
out all segments the fixation frequency was greatest on
the screen, indicating its importance and validating the
gaze strategy of expert surgeons. In preoperative set-up,
juniors had significantly more fixations per second on the
operating theatre (median 0⋅09/s versus 0⋅03/s for experts;
P = 0⋅023). This suggests that junior surgeons need more
assistance in preoperative set-up via visual and audio cues
from the surrounding environment. Similarly, during for-
mation of the retrogastric tunnel the juniors had a higher
fixation rate on the operating theatre (0⋅01/s versus 0⋅00/s
for experts; P = 0⋅017), and also on the scrub nurse (0⋅01
versus 0⋅00/s respectively; P = 0⋅011). This indicates that
juniors have a higher reliance on the scrub nurse for instru-
ment choice, potentially leading to reduced concentra-
tion on important AOIs. During gastric pouch creation
junior surgeons had an increased fixation frequency on the
operative field (0⋅05/s versus 0⋅03/s for experts; P = 0⋅011).
This is most likely the result of the higher number of
instrument changes during this segment, and the difference
results from a reduced familiarity with inserting instru-
ments within ports compared with the expert cohort. Addi-
tionally, experts do not withdraw their concentration from
the screen as much when requesting and inserting another
instrument.
These results are supported by previous work10 using
eye tracking during open inguinal hernia repair, in which
experts also had a significantly increased dwell time on
the operative site. The statistically significant increase
in dwell time for experts on critical AOIs also con-
forms to the information reduction hypothesis29, which
states that experts selectively neglect redundant infor-
mation and focus on pertinent information, such as the
screen.
Previous work15,
16 from a group in British Columbia,
Canada, demonstrated that expert surgeons had a reduced
dwell time on a laparoscopic screen and increased saccades
to patient vital signs in a simulated environment. Although
this contradicts the data presented in the present study, it
should be noted that the Canadian study was in a simulated
environment without the assistance of allied health profes-
sionals. The reason for this difference could be that in an
operating theatre experts are able to use other members
of the team and verbal communication skills to monitor
the vital signs whilst maintaining concentration on the
operative screen.
With regard to secondary parameters, it was shown that
experts had a significantly lower blink rate throughout all
recorded segments. A reduced blink rate has been shown
previously to correlate with improved concentration in
allied fields such as aviation30 and video game tasks31. This
supports the previous deductions from dwell times and
fixation frequency regarding improved concentration and
efficiency in expert surgeons.
Juniors had significantly larger maximum pupil diameters
in all segments apart from segment 1. Hess and Polt32 orig-
inally demonstrated a positive correlation between pupil
diameter and high cognitive workload. This has been con-
sequently verified through multiple examples across differ-
ent fields33–35. The rate of change in pupil diameter has
been shown to be a better indicator of sustained cogni-
tive workload throughout a recorded segment35,
36. Here,
experts were shown to have a lower rate of change in all
segments. This, along with maximum pupil size, suggests
that experts had a lower cognitive workload throughout the
whole procedure compared with juniors.
It is important to consider the limitations of this study.
LRYGB is a technically challenging procedure and conse-
quently performed only by senior trainees and consultant
surgeons. This resulted in a limited number of surgeons
being able to take part in this study. Ideally the study should
be replicated in additional centres to validate the findings.
Additionally, this study contained no sample size calcula-
tion, as no other data for live laparoscopic surgery exist. It
is possible that surgeons could succumb to the Hawthorne
effect and manipulate their eye movements in order to
produce a falsely high reading on specific AOIs. How-
ever, this is an issue that should affect both cohorts; in the
future these data could be used to provide a cut-off score
to exclude samples that are deemed to have been manipu-
lated. Another limitation was that there was no standard for
potential distractions in the operating theatre. T
o minimize
any potential impact, a researcher was present throughout
data collection to make note of, and exclude, any extraneous
distractions from the analysis. The experience of the oper-
ating theatre staff may have influenced the gaze behaviour
of the surgeons. The junior surgeons had a greater number
of consultant grade assistants, which should produce the
opposite bias to the results presented. The analysis of max-
imum pupil size has the potential to be affected by ambient
lighting conditions; standard lighting was used through-
out, with ambient white light during preoperative set-up
and ambient green lighting throughout the other segments.
The use of dark pupil-tracking technology reduced any
potential effects of ambient light on mapping fixations37.

 Gaze behaviour of trainee and experienced surgeons during gastric bypass
Finally, the analysis did not focus on the other two criti-
cal steps of the bypass: the gastrojejunal and jejunojejunal
anastomoses. This was due to limitations in the length of
recording available from the eye-tracking apparatus.
Future aims for eye-tracking research should focus on
both training and assessment. For training, specifically
identifying anatomical structures that experts use should
improve efficiency and orientation throughout the proce-
dure. Studies27,
28 have identified that gaze strategies are a
result of top-down processes to focus on useful stimuli and
thus can be taught. Additionally, work should continue to
develop eye tracking as a tool for validating surgeon tech-
nical skill level. The next step is to analyse any correlative
or predictive relationships between gaze behaviours and
either clinically relevant patient outcomes or other assess-
ment metrics, such as the OSATS.
