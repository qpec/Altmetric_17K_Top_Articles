Abstract
Purpose: EGFR is a well-validated target for patients with non–
small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). CIMAvax-EGF is a therapeutic
cancer vaccine composed of human recombinant EGF conjugated
to a carrier protein and Montanide ISA51 as adjuvant. The vaccine
is intended to induce antibodies against self EGFs that block
EGF–EGFR interaction.
Experimental Design: To evaluate overall survival, safety,
immunogenicity,
and
EGF
concentration
in
serum
after
CIMAvax-EGF, a randomized phase III trial was done in patients
with advanced NSCLC. Four to 6 weeks after first-line chemo-
therapy, 405 patients with stage IIIB/IV NSCLC were randomly
assigned to a vaccine group, which received CIMAvax-EGF or a
control group, treated with best supportive care.
Results: Long-term vaccination was very safe. Most frequent
adverse reactions were grade 1 or 2 injection-site pain, fever,
vomiting, and headache. Vaccination induced anti-EGF anti-
bodies and decreased serum EGF concentration. In the safety
population, median survival time (MST) was 10.83 months in
the vaccine arm versus 8.86 months in the control arm. These
differences were not significant according the standard log
rank (HR, 0.82; P ¼ 0.100), but according a weighted log rank
(P ¼ 0.04) that was applied once the nonproportionality of
the HR was verified. Survival benefit was significant (HR, 0.77;
P ¼ 0.036) in the per-protocol setting (patients receiving at
least four vaccine doses): MST was 12.43 months for the vaccine
arm versus 9.43 months for the control arm. MST was higher
(14.66 months) for vaccinated patients with high EGF concen-
tration at baseline.
Conclusions: Switch maintenance with CIMAvax-EGF was well
tolerated and significantly increased MST of patients that com-
pleted induction vaccination. Baseline EGF concentration pre-
dicted survival benefit. Clin Cancer Res; 22(15); 3782–90. �2016 AACR.
Introduction
Lung cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-
related deaths in men and women, provoking approximately
1.6 million deceases, 19.4% of the total deaths per year,
worldwide (1). In Cuba for instance, lung cancer is the
leading cause of death in both genders with more than
one-quarter of all cancer deaths. Non–small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) is the most common form of the disease (87%), and
approximately 60% of the patients present with advanced
disease at diagnosis (2).

 Treatment of advanced NSCLC has undergone a rapid evolution
along the last 30 years with three major advances: the platinum-
based doublets, maintenance and second-line chemotherapy with
docetaxel, pemetrexed, or erlotinib, and targeted therapies with
small molecules such as gefitinib, erlotinib, afatinib, crizotinib, or
ceritinib for tumors with sensitizing mutations (3–6). Nevertheless,
1-year survival rate is approximately 35% for patients with wild-
type tumors, whereas 5-year survival rate is still around 5% (2).
EGFR is overexpressed in approximately 40% to 80% of
NSCLCs (7). The oncogenic addiction of the malignancies to this
signaling pathway triggers its inappropriate activation and pro-
motes the uncontrolled growth, proliferation, and survival of
cancer cells (8). Thus, EGFR overexpression is associated with
poor prognosis, lower survival, and resistance to therapy (9).
The EGF-based cancer vaccine CIMAvax-EGF is an active immu-
notherapy, intended to prevent binding of the endogenous EGF to
the receptors, by inducing anti-EGF antibodies that clear the
growth factor from circulation (10). CIMAvax-EGF is composed
by human recombinant EGF coupled to a carrier protein, recom-
binant P64. The EGF–P64 chemical conjugate is emulsified in
Montanide, an oily adjuvant. The carrier protein and the adjuvant
are required to break the tolerance against EGF, which is a self-
protein. Previous phase I/II clinical trials evidenced the immu-
nogenicity and safety of vaccination in patients with advanced
stage NSCLC (11–13). In a randomized phase II trial using
CIMAvax-EGF as switch maintenance or second-line therapy
versus best supportive care in subjects with stage IIIB or IV NSCLC,
a trend toward survival benefit was found. Patients younger than
60 years, those with good antibody response against EGF, and
subjects in whom serum EGF concentration ([EGF]) decreased
below a preestablished threshold, achieved a significant survival
benefit with vaccination. Postimmune serum hampered the bind-
ing between EGF and EGFR in a radioreceptor assay and abrogated
EGFR phosphorylation (14, 15).
In this article, weshow the results of a randomized phase III trial
in patients with advanced NSCLC. The primary endpoint was
overall survival (OS), whereas safety, immunogenicity, and serum
EGF concentration before and after therapy were secondary
endpoints.
Patients and Methods
Eligibility criteria
Eligible patients were 18 years or older with histologically or
cytological proven stage IIIB/IV NSCLC and an Eastern Cooper-
ative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 2.
Patients with all histologic NSCLC subtypes and life expectancy
of at least 3 months were trial candidates. Other inclusion
criteria included hemoglobin values above 90 g/L, leukocytes
count � 3.0 � 109/L, platelets count � 150 � 109/L, aspartate
aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase up to 2.5 times
the upper institutional limit, and creatinine, up to 2 times the
upper institutional reference value. All patients received four to six
cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy (mostly cisplatin/carbo-
platin in combination with vinblastine, etoposide, or paclitaxel)
and had stable disease or objective response.
The trial protocol, informed consent, investigator brochure,
and case report forms were approved by the ethics boards from
all participating institutions and by the National Regulatory
Agency. Informed consent was obtained from each subject
before entering in the study. The study was done in compliance
with the principles of Good Clinical Practices (according the
International Conference of Harmonization) and the Declara-
tion of Helsinki.
Treatment schedule
Four to 6 weeks after finishing first-line chemotherapy, patients
were randomly assigned (2:1) to the vaccine group, which
received the EGF cancer vaccine plus best supportive care, or the
control group that was treated with best supportive care. Patients
in the vaccine arm were given a low dose of cyclophosphamide
(200 mg/m2) intravenously 72 hours before the first immuniza-
tion. Each vaccine dose was administered at four injection sites
(two deltoid and two gluteus regions) every 2 weeks for four doses
(induction period) and then monthly.
CIMAvax-EGF was manufactured at the industrial facility of the
Centre for Molecular Immunology (Havana, Cuba) in compli-
ance with the Good Manufacturing Practice standards for bio-
pharmaceutical products. The vaccine is composed of human
recombinant EGF manufactured in yeast (hu-recEGF), and it is
chemically conjugated to the P64K Neisseria meningitides recom-
binant protein (recP64k) manufactured in Escherichia coli. The
final formulation of the cancer vaccine (0.6 mg hu-recEGF/
recP64k) is then mixed in a water-in-oil emulsion with Montanide
(Seppic) immediately before injection. At each immunization,
patients received 2.4 mg of hu-recEGF/recP64k/Montanide (16).
Patient assessment
Patient assessment was performed at baseline and every 4
weeks, and included physical exam and clinical laboratory tests,
as described in the inclusion criteria. In addition, chest radiogra-
phy, CT scan, and abdominal ultrasound were performed at
baseline and every 3 months to assess clinical response according
to RECIST, version 1.1.
Toxicity was graded according to the NCI Common Toxicity
Criteria (version 3) at each visit. Criteria for discontinuing vac-
cination included voluntary withdrawal, unmanageable toxicity,
or severe worsening of the patient's general conditions. Progres-
sive disease according to RECIST 1.1 was not an interruption
criterion.
Measurements of antibody titers
Blood samples were collected at baseline (pretreatment) and
every 14 days for 60 days and monthly thereafter. Anti-EGF
antibody titers were measured through ELISA as described in
Translational Relevance
The EGF vaccine consists of a different approach when
compared with other active immunotherapies. CIMAVax-EGF
is built on the induction of a specificimmune response, aiming
to sequester EGF, a molecular driver of cancer cell prolifera-
tion. The significantly largest benefit of CIMAvax-EGF in the
subpopulation of patients with high pretreatment concentra-
tion of EGF is differentiating our cancer vaccine when com-
pared with other modalities of active immunotherapy or
targeted therapy. CIMAvax-EGF is a very safe drug that could
be a feasible intervention for long-term control of those
patients with NSCLC with tumors depending on the EGF,
capable to mount a rapid and durable response.

 previous studies. Patients were classified in good antibody
responders (GAR) if they developed anti-EGF antibody titers
equal or higher than 1:4,000 and super-good antibody respon-
ders if they reached anti-EGF antibody titers equal or higher
than 1:64,000. Those vaccinated patients that did not have
titers above 1:4,000 were classified as poor antibodies respon-
ders (12–15).
EGF concentration in serum was measured with a commercial
ELISA (Quantikine EGF; R&D Systems Inc) in 50% of the enrolled
patients. Subjects were classified according to their pretreatment
(baseline) serum EGF concentration in high EGF ([EGF] > 870 pg/
mL) or low EGF ([EGF] � 870 pg/mL). The selected cutoff
(870 pg/mL) corresponded to the median EGF concentration for
all patients at day 0.
Statistical analysis
The projected sample size was 579, considering that a two-
sided log-rank test with 386 vaccinated patients and 193 con-
trols achieves 90% power at a 0.05% significance level to detect
an HR of 0.7. The proportion dropping out of the treatment and
control groups was anticipated to be 10%. First and second
interim analyses were done after 40% and 60% of the patients
were enrolled. The trial was stopped before reaching the
intended sample size, after the marketing approval of CIMA-
vax-EGF by the National Regulatory Agency, at the second
interim analysis.
Survival time (date of random assignment to date of death or
last contact) was estimated by the Kaplan–Meier method in the
safety population (patients receiving at least one vaccine dose)
and in the per-protocol population as established in the trial
protocol. The per-protocol population included those patients
that completed four doses of CIMAvax-EGF (induction period).
Control patients that did not survive for 6 weeks (time interval
needed to complete CIMAvax-EGF induction period) were
excluded from the survival comparison. Regarding serum EGF,
a prospectively defined subgroup was retrospectively analyzed
using the analytically validated test for EGF concentration. The
evaluation of the EGF concentration as predictive or prognostic
biomarker was classified as exploratory.
Survival comparison was done with a standard log-rank test
and a weighted log-rank test (Harrington–Fleming), according to
the proportionality of the hazards (17). The hazard proportion-
ality was checked graphically in agreement with the methodology
proposed by Lambert and colleagues (18). The Pearson correla-
tion coefficient and Fisher exact tests were used to estimate the
correlation between anti-EGF titers and [EGF] and to assess the
uniform distribution of baseline variables between groups,
respectively.
Progression-free survival (PFS) was not a secondary objective as
it is not a recommended endpoint for evaluating vaccines efficacy.
Because of their immunologic mechanisms of action, cancer
vaccines may require considerable time after administration to
induce immunity. Therefore, tumors in subjects treated with
cancer vaccines may show early progression followed by subse-
quent response.
The statistical system SPSS (version 15.1) and R (version 2)
were used for modeling and verifying the hypothesis in all
population sets. This study was registered in the National
Public Registry of Clinical Trials; a WHO-validated public
registry
(http://www.who.int/ictrp/network/rpcec/en,
trial
number RPCEC00000161)
Results
From July 5, 2006, to January 3, 2012, 1,336 patients were
evaluated for eligibility in 19 Cuban clinical research centers. A
total of 405 patients with histology or cytology proven NSCLC at
stage IIIB and IV were enrolled in the trial: 270 in the vaccine arm
and 135 in the control group. A total of 246 patients received at
least one vaccine dose (safety population); 219 subjects received 4
doses (per-protocol population), 85 patients received more than
14 CIMAvax-EGF doses (1-year vaccination), 39 patients were
vaccinated 26 times or more (2-year vaccination), and 12 subjects
received more than 50 vaccine doses (4-year vaccination). Three
control patients were vaccinated, as compassionate use, upon trial
withdrawal (Supplementary Fig. S1). Control patients who
received CIMAvax-EGF were excluded from the analysis.
Twenty-four patients (8.8%) from the vaccine arm did not
receive any vaccine dose, while 27 patients (10.9%) who started
vaccination did not complete CIMAvax-EGF induction (four
doses). The main causes of early dropout were rapid worsening
of the performance status, consent withdrawal, uncompensated
comorbidities, schedule violations, and rapid unset of death.
Eighteen patients, 10 vaccinated (3.7%) and 8 controls (5.9%),
died before day 45 (time needed to complete induction vaccina-
tion). No significant differences were found between both arms
regarding early death.
The two arms were well matched for baseline demographic and
tumor variables, such as sex, ethnic origin, age, smoking status,
ECOG, disease stage, histology, and response to initial chemo-
therapy (Table 1).
Most patients did not receive further chemotherapy at progres-
sion (in consonance with the national treatment guideline), as the

 recommended second-line drugs pemetrexed, docetaxel, and
erlotinib were not widely available in the country at the time of
trial execution. In the vaccine arm, 16 patients (5.9%) received
additional chemotherapy, including carboplatin, cisplatin, pac-
litaxel, etoposide, vinblastine, cyclophosphamide, and docetaxel.
In the control group, nine subjects (6.6%) were treated with other
chemotherapies comprising paclitaxel, carboplatin, vinblastine,
etoposide, vincristine, and docetaxel. Overall, only two patients,
one from each arm, received docetaxel, one of the drugs accepted
to increase survival after progressive disease.

12.71), whereas MST in the control group was 8.86 months (95%
CI, 6.69–11.03). Five-year survival rate was 14.4% for vaccinated
patients and 7.9% for controls. As a delayed separation of the
survival curves and a nonproportional HR between the two
groups was verified, the Harrington–Fleming (HF) test was
applied. The survival difference was significant according to this
weighted log-rank test (HF, P ¼ 0.04).
In addition, OS was evaluated in the per-protocol population as
established in the trial protocol. The median survival in
the vaccine arm (patients completing four vaccine doses) was
12.43 months (95% CI, 10.42–14.45) versus 9.43 months (95%
CI, 7.53–11.33) in the control arm (patients surviving for at least 6
weeks). Five-year survival rate was 16.62% for those vaccinated
patients who received 4 vaccine doses versus 6.2% for nonvacci-
nated patients. Survival differences in the per-protocol popula-
tion were significant according to the standard, unweighted log-
rank test: (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.61–0.98; P ¼ 0.036; Fig. 1B).

 Serum EGF at baseline might be a prognostic and predictive
factor of vaccine efficacy
Serum EGF was quantified in 188 patients. Mean and median
EGF concentrations were 1,195 pg/mL and 873 pg/mL, respec-
tively. There were no differences in the serum EGF levels
between vaccinated and control patients. Mean and median
EGF concentrations were 1,194 pg/mL and 930 pg/mL for
the vaccine arm and 1,197 pg/mL and 820 pg/mL for controls
(P ¼ 0.98).
Median EGF concentration (870 pg/mL) was established as a
cutoff to classify patients in high or low [EGF] at enrollment, as
prespecified in the protocol. Survival according to [EGF] at base-
line was evaluated in control and vaccinated patients to prelim-
inarily assess the prognostic and predictive value of the referred
biomarker.
In the control group, patients with high [EGF] had a worse
survival as compared with patients with low [EGF] (HR, 0.38;
95% CI, 0.20–0.70; P ¼ 0.002; Fig. 2A). Median OS was 8.63
months (95% CI, 1.15–28.28) for controls with high [EGF]
versus 15.06 months (95% CI, 1.67–15.59) for subjects with
low [EGF]. According to this analysis, high EGF levels may be a
poor prognostic factor, whereas low EGF may be a good
prognostic factor for NSCLC patients. The association between
EGF levels and prognosis remained significant when other
prognostic variables (gender, smoking history, performance
status, and staging) were included in the multivariate analysis.
In the multivariate analysis, the most significant variables were
EGF concentration and ECOG.
On the contrary, patients with serum [EGF] > 870 pg/mL had
a better survival as compared with controls with the same EGF
serum levels if vaccinated with CIMAvax-EGF (HR, 0.41; 95%
CI, 0.25–0.67; P ¼ 0.0001). MST for vaccinated patients
was 14.66 months (95% CI, 8.34–20.98) versus 8.63 months
(95% CI, 1.67–15.59) for nonvaccinated patients. Five-year
survival rate was 23% for vaccinated patients while no controls
were alive after 60 months. According to this retrospective
analysis (predefined in the protocol), [EGF] above the 870
pg/mL threshold, could be a predictive biomarker of CIMA-
vax-EGF efficacy (Fig. 2B). The interaction between EGF
levels and treatment was checked and was statistically signif-
icant (P < 0.0001).
Vaccination with CIMAvax-EGF induced anti-EGF antibodies
and decreased EGF concentration in sera
Anti-EGF antibody titers were evaluated in 112 patients (40%
of subjects enrolled in the vaccine arm). Eighty-nine patients
(79.4%) were classified as good responders, whereas 24 patients
(21.4%) were categorized as super-good responders, as they
developed anti-EGF antibody titers above 1:64,000 sera dilution.
The percentage of patients reaching the GAR condition after one,
two, three, or four vaccine doses was 0, 7%, 39%, and 56%,
respectively. Four doses was the minimum number of injections
after which 50% of the patients met the GAR status. Patients who
met the GAR criterion after the induction period had a significant
survival benefit: MST was 14.90 months versus 8.86 months for
the controls (HR, 0.638; 95% CI, 0.44–0.92; P ¼ 0.017). Overall,
the geometric mean of the maximal antibody titer was 1:12,646,
whereas the highest antibody titer was 1:1,024,000.
In addition, serum EGF was measured before and after vacci-
nation. A significant inverse correlation was observed (Spearman
r ¼ �0.523; P < 0.01) between the anti-EGF antibody titers and
serum EGF concentration in vaccinated patients (Fig. 3). In
control patients, there was no association between antibody titers
and serum EGF.
A subgroup exploration including the most important demo-
graphic and tumor variables was done in the safety population
(Fig. 4). In addition to high serum EGF concentration, patients
with the largest benefit after vaccination were those bearing
squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) histology, smokers, and with
stage IV.
Long-term vaccination with CIMAvax-EGF was safe
The safety evaluable population consisted of 246 patients who
received at least one dose of CIMAvax-EGF. Adverse events were
reported in 78.3% of the safety evaluable population, and 1,200
vaccine-related events were reported in 59.4% of the treated
patients. Most frequent related adverse events were injection-
site pain (46.6%), fever (36.5%), vomiting (23.3%), and head-
ache (22.5%). Grade 3–related adverse events were seen in
3.6% of the vaccinated patients and consisted of headache
(two patients), dyspnea (two patients), injection-site reactions
(two patients), eosinophilia (two patients), fever (one patient),
chills (one patient), tremors (one patient), and arthralgia
(one patient). No patient developed grade 4 adverse events
(Table 2 and Supplementary Tables S2 and S3).
Discussion
The treatment of advanced NSCLC has undergone a rapid
evolution along the last 30 years: from a dark landscape in the
1980s to the demonstration of survival gain after the combi-
nation of platinum doublets, maintenance, and second-line
therapy with docetaxel, pemetrexed, and erlotinib for patients
with EGFR and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) wild-type
tumors (3–5).
Another big wave of improvement came with targeted ther-
apies with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) like gefitinib, erlo-
tinib, and afatinib for tumors carrying EGFR mutations and
crizotinib and ceritinib for tumors carrying ALK-activating
translocations (19). The median survival in patients with met-
astatic disease and defined mutations ranged from 23 to 27

 months (20). Unfortunately, the population bearing EGFR or
ALK mutations, and thus benefiting from the approved targeted
therapies, is small (�15%–20%; ref. 6).
The next wave of progress is coming from immunotherapy.
Long-lasting responses have been reported after the use of the
anti-PD1 antibodies (nivolumab, pembrolizumab) and the
anti-PD1L antibodies (MPDL3280A, BMS936559, MEDI4736).
Moreover, nivolumab has recently demonstrated to increase
survival of patients bearing metastatic squamous and adeno-
carcinoma NSCLC that progressed on or after platinum-based
chemotherapy, as compared with docetaxel (21, 22). Pembro-
lizumab showed remarkable antitumor activity in patients with
advanced NSCLC and PD-L1 expression in at least 50% of
tumor cells (23). FDA recently approved both checkpoint
inhibitors for the treatment of metastatic NSCLC as second-
line therapy.
Active immunization might also improve lung cancer survival if
the vaccine successfully triggers a strong immune response and if
used in the right population. Clinical studies with three vaccine
candidates in advanced population, such as tecemotide, TG4010,
and belagenpumatucel-L, did not meet their primary endpoints
but showed possible benefits in patient subpopulations: for
tecemotide, a potential role of vaccination was seen in patients
treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy; for TG4010, the
lymphocyte phenotype and concomitance with chemotherapy
were reported as potential predictors of outcome; and for bela-
genpumatucel-L, the number of circulating tumor cells appears to
correlate with OS (24–26).
The EGF vaccine consists of a different approach when com-
pared with other active immunotherapies. CIMAvax-EGF is built
on the induction of a specific immune response, aiming to
sequester EGF, a molecular driver of cancer cell proliferation
(11–15). Its mechanism of action is based on the "hormone
deprivation theory" that has proven to be effective for sexual
hormones–dependent tumors (10). The rationale of CIMAvax-
EGF is based on the finding that EGF concentration is higher in
NSCLC patients than in normal donors. The preliminary role of
[EGF] as a negative prognostic marker for advanced NSCLC
reinforces the validity of the "removal" approach (9).
In this phase III study, CIMAvax-EGF was very safe even in
patients who received very prolonged vaccination (more than 2
years) and did not show cumulative toxicity.
Immunogenicity assessment was a secondary endpoint of this
phase III clinical trial. The protocol projected the evaluation of
40% of the patients for anti-EGF response, as a full characteriza-
tion of the immunogenicity was done in all previous trials
(five exploratory and one phase II trials). This protocol evaluated
a different vaccine dose and schedule, as compared with the
controlled phase II, that yielded a good antibody response in
53% of the vaccinated patients. After vaccinating with a high-
antigen dose at four injection sites (current phase III protocol),
78.8% of the patients had a good response (anti-EGF antibody
titers >4,000). Still, only 21.2% of the vaccinated patients
achieved a super good response (anti-EGF > 1:64,000). CIMA-
vax-EGF was not only immunogenic but also reduced the EGF
concentration to undetectable levels. There was an inverse corre-
lation between serum EGF and the anti-EGF antibody titers.
Regarding efficacy, patients who received at least four doses of
CIMAvax-EGF had a significant survival advantage. For active
immunotherapy, where the target is the immune system and not
the tumor, it is mandatory to administer a minimum number of
vaccine doses to break the tolerance against self-antigens (27, 28).
Moreover, in a post hoc analysis in the safety population,
CIMAvax-EGF significantly increased OS when a weighted log-
rank test was used. The Harrington–Fleming test is very sensitive
to detect a delayed effect in the survival curves when the HR is not
proportional. The "delayed benefit" and the survival advantage in
a population completing the induction period indicate that there
is a time lag before CIMAvax-EGF can be effective (17, 28). A
rational combination with chemotherapy can allow the vaccine to
"buy" that time. The immunogenicity of CIMAvax-EGF has been
already demonstrated in combination with platinum doublets.
PFS was not a secondary goal of the study, as endpoints based
on tumor assessments (response rate, PFS) may not be appropri-
ate for a late-phase clinical trial for a cancer vaccine. Previously,
other vaccines and immunomodulatory antibodies have not
shown improvement in PFS: sipuleucel-T and PROSTVAC-VF in

 melanoma were associated with no improvement in PFS and
response rate, but statistically significant benefit in OS (29).
The incidence of activating EGFR and ALK translocations was
not evaluated in the trial, as the TKIs targeting the referred
mutations were not accessible. However, theoretically, CIMA-
vax-EGF would be effective in patients lacking EGFR mutations.
EGFR is constitutively activated in tumors with mutations at the
intracellular domain, which do not require EGF binding for
signal transduction. According to our preliminary data, CIMA-
vax-EGF is more active in Caucasian, smoker males bearing
SCCs. Patients benefiting largely from EGFR TKI are Asian,
female, nonsmoker with adenocarcinomas. These demographic
characteristics correspond with EGFR-sensitizing mutations at
exons 19 and 21. The actual correlation between EGFR muta-
tions and efficacy of CIMAvax-EGF will be addressed in the
forthcoming trials.
Particularly, our data suggest that survival gain occurs mainly in
patients having high EGF concentration after front-line chemo-
therapy. MST in this patient population (14.66 months) is com-
parable with the survival of patients receiving other drugs recom-
mended as continuation or switch maintenance. This result is
more relevant, provided that 94% of patients did not receive
second-line chemotherapy upon progression. This observation
highlights the importance of a predictive biomarker to maximize
the therapeutic value of CIMAvax-EGF. A new clinical trial enroll-
ing patients with [EGF] above the 870 pg/mL threshold is already
ongoing (30).
In summary, CIMAvax-EGF is a very safe drug that could be a
feasible intervention for long-term control of those NSCLC
patients with tumors depending on the EGF, capable to mount
a rapid and durable response.
