Abstract
The interferon-inducible protein Z-DNA binding protein 1 (ZBP1, also known as DNA-dependent 
activator of IFN-regulatory factors (DAI) and DLM-1) was identified as a dsDNA sensor, which 
instigates innate immune responses. However, this classification has been disputed and whether 
ZBP1 functions as a pathogen sensor during an infection has remained unknown. Herein, we 
demonstrated ZBP1-mediated sensing of the influenza A virus (IAV) proteins NP and PB1, 
triggering cell death and inflammatory responses via the RIPK1–RIPK3–Caspase-8 axis. ZBP1 
regulates NLRP3 inflammasome activation as well as induction of apoptosis, necroptosis and 
pyroptosis in IAV-infected cells. Importantly, ZBP1 deficiency protected mice from mortality 
during IAV infection owing to reduced inflammatory responses and epithelial damage. Overall, 
these findings indicate that ZBP1 is an innate immune sensor of IAV and highlight its importance 
in the pathogenesis of IAV infection.

 INTRODUCTION
The influenza virus infects millions of people annually and causes significant morbidity and 
up to half a million deaths (1). Type A Influenza virus (IAV) is also associated with 
epidemics and pandemics owing to high mutation rates and genetic reassortment. Pattern-
recognition receptors, including Toll-like receptors (TLRs), RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) and 
nucleotide and oligomerization domain, leucine-rich repeats-containing proteins (NLRs) 
have a central role in the recognition of IAV infection (2). Virus sensing by these receptors 
initiates an innate immune response aimed at controlling virus replication and eliminating 
the infectious virus.
Innate sensing of IAV triggers multiple intracellular signaling cascades that coordinately 
regulate induction of type I interferons (IFNs) and proinflammatory cytokines (2). In 
addition, virus sensing also induces cell death in order to destroy the replicative niche 
necessary for survival and propagation of these intracellular pathogens (3). While epithelial 
cell death facilitates control of virus replication by eliminating infected cells, uncontrolled 
cell death can exacerbate tissue injury and compromise lung function (4). Previous studies 
have demonstrated an inherent link between orchestration of various programmed cell death 
pathways and pathogenesis of IAV (5). Consistent with this, apoptosis in lung epithelial cells 
was shown to exacerbate pneumonia and mortality during IAV infection (6). Similarly, 
uncontrolled necroptosis in airway epithelial cells also increases morbidity and mortality 
during IAV infection (7). Unlike the detrimental effects of apoptosis and necroptosis, 
NLRP3 inflammasome activation leading to pyroptosis and release of proinflammatory 
cytokines IL-1β and IL-18 is protective during acute IAV infection (8, 9). Although all these 
cell death pathways are known to be activated during IAV infection, the innate immune 
sensors initiating cell death and the intracellular signaling cascades regulating this response 
are largely unknown and are defined in this study.
RESULTS
The IFN-inducible protein ZBP1 mediates cell death in response to IAV infection
To delineate the virus sensing pathways initiating cell death responses during IAV infection, 
cell death was assessed in primary murine BMDMs infected with Influenza virus A/Puerto 
Rico/8/34 (PR8; H1N1). BMDMs lacking the TLR adaptor proteins MyD88 or TRIF, or the 
RIG-I adaptor MAVS undergo cell death during infection with this mouse-adapted virus, 
probably due to functional redundancy of TLR and RIG-I pathways in IAV sensing in these 
cells (2) (fig. S1A and C). Furthermore, BMDMs and fibroblasts lacking the adaptor STING 
(central for DNA sensing), TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1), TNFR2 or the adaptor molecule 
TNFR1-associated death domain protein (TRADD) were also susceptible to IAV-induced 
cell death (Fig. 1A to D and fig. S1B and C). In contrast, cells lacking type I IFN receptor 1 
(IFNAR1) or its downstream signaling proteins STAT1 and IRF9 were fully resistant to IAV-
induced cell death (Fig. 1A to D and fig. S1D). Increased levels of M1 and NS1 proteins in 
IAV-infected Ifnar1−/− BMDMs confirmed proper virus entry and replication in these cells 
(fig. S1E). These results demonstrated that cell death during IAV infection is initiated 
through a pathway mediated by type I IFN signaling.

 Enrichment of the microarray gene expression dataset from IAV-infected WT and Ifnar1−/− 
BMDMs for nucleic acid sensing pathways followed by qRT-PCR revealed a significant 
reduction in the expression of a number of genes encoding proinflammatory cytokines and 
nucleic acid sensors in Ifnar1−/− BMDMs compared to WT BMDMs (Fig. 1E and F and fig. 
S2A). Interestingly, one of the most downregulated nucleic acid sensors in Ifnar1−/− 
BMDMs was the gene encoding Z–DNA binding protein 1 (ZBP1; also called DLM-1 and 
DAI) (Fig. 1E and F). Expression of ZBP1 was robustly upregulated in WT BMDMs 
infected with IAV, through a mechanism that required IFNAR1, STAT1 and IRF9 (Fig. 1G 
and H and fig. S2B). ZBP1 was initially identified as a cytosolic sensor of double-stranded 
(ds)DNA which drives type I IFN responses (10). However, this classification has been 
disputed after generation of Zbp1−/− mice (11–13). ZBP1 was of potential interest because 
of its unknown role in innate immune sensing and its possible role in the regulation of cell 
death (10–14).
The IFNAR-dependent cell death observed in IAV-infected cells prompted us to hypothesize 
that ZBP1 is an innate sensor of IAV driving cell death responses. Remarkably, Zbp1−/− 
BMDMs and fibroblasts were completely resistant to IAV-induced cell death (Fig. 1I to L). 
Real time analysis of ZBP1-dependent cell death in IAV-infected fibroblasts using IncuCyte 
and SYTOX green nucleic acid staining demonstrated that cell death was initiated at 8 to 10 
h post infection (pi) which corresponds to one replication cycle of IAV (Fig. 1M). 
Comparable levels of the viral protein NS1 and IFNβ in Zbp1−/− BMDMs infected with IAV 
confirmed proper virus entry, replication and IFNβ secretion in these cells (fig. S2C and D). 
Together, these data demonstrate a critical role for ZBP1 in the regulation of cell death 
during IAV infection.
ZBP1 regulates NLRP3 inflammasome activation and proinflammatory cytokine production 
during IAV infection via the RIPK1–RIPK3–Caspase-8 axis
Distinct forms of programmed cell death, including pyroptosis, necroptosis and apoptosis, 
are initiated by context-specific stimuli encountered by the cell (15). Previous studies have 
demonstrated NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated activation of the pyroptosis-inducing 
cysteine protease, caspase-1, during IAV infection (16–19). While robust activation of 
caspase-1 was observed in WT BMDMs infected with IAV, this response was abrogated in 
Zbp1−/−, Ifnar1−/− and Nlrp3−/− BMDMs (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, the levels of the 
inflammasome-dependent cytokines, IL-1β and IL-18, were significantly reduced in Zbp1−/− 
and Ifnar1−/− cells compared to WT BMDMs (Fig. 2B to C), confirming a requirement for 
ZBP1 and type I IFN signaling in the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome during IAV 
infection. ZBP1 was dispensable for the activation of caspase-1 and the release of IL-1β and 
IL-18 in response to the RNA virus vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), the canonical NLRP3 
activator LPS plus ATP, and to the non-canonical NLRP3 activators Escherichia coli and 
Citrobacter rodentium infection (Fig. 2D and fig. S3A to C). Notably, NLRP3 
inflammasome activation during IAV infection did not require caspase-11 (Fig. 2E). These 
data identified a unique, type I IFN- and ZBP1-dependent pathway of NLRP3 
inflammasome activation, which differ from the canonical and non-canonical NLRP3 
inflammasome pathways.

 ZBP1 is dispensable for activation of the NLRC4 and AIM2 inflammasomes since infection 
by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Francisella novicida and murine 
cytomegalovirus (MCMV), as well as transfection of poly(dA:dT) induced normal caspase-1 
activation and secretion of IL-1β or IL-18 in Zbp1−/− BMDMs (fig. S3D to G). Although 
ZBP1 is a key regulator of IAV-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation, ZBP1-dependent 
cell death during IAV infection occurred normally in Nlrp3−/−, Casp1−/− and Gsdmd−/− 
BMDMs (fig. S4A to D). These data suggest activation of other complimentary cell death 
pathways in IAV-infected cells.
ZBP1 contains two receptor-interacting protein homotypic interaction motif (RHIM) 
domains that can interact with other RHIM-containing proteins including the receptor 
interacting protein kinase-3 (RIPK3) (20, 21). Indeed, immunoprecipitation experiments 
revealed interaction of ZBP1 with RIPK3 in IAV-infected cells (Fig. 2F). Consistent with 
previous studies demonstrating RIPK3-mediated activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome 
(19, 22, 23), a substantial reduction in caspase-1 cleavage and the levels of IL-1β and IL-18 
were observed in Ripk3−/− BMDMs infected with IAV (Fig. 2G and H). The residual 
activation of caspase-1 observed in Ripk3−/− BMDMs was abolished in Ripk3−/−Casp8−/− 
BMDMs (Fig. 2G). BMDMs lacking RIPK1 kinase activity (Ripk1KD/KD) showed normal 
activation of caspase-1 and release of IL-1β and IL-18 (Fig. 2G and H).
The ZBP1-RIPK1 complex transduces NFκB activation signals (20, 21). Consistent with 
this, secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, IL-6 and TNF was abrogated in 
Ripk3−/−Casp8−/−Ripk1−/− as well as Zbp1−/− BMDMs (Fig. 2I and J). A modest reduction 
in IL-6 and TNF production was observed in Ripk3−/− and Ripk3−/−Casp8−/− BMDMs (Fig. 
2I). Regulation of IL-6 and TNF production is dependent on RIPK1 scaffolding function, but 
occurs independently of its kinase activity since the levels of these cytokines were 
comparable in WT and Ripk1KD/KD cells (Fig. 2I). Collectively, these data identified ZBP1 
as an upstream regulator mediating NLRP3 inflammasome activation via the RIPK3–
Caspase-8 axis and proinflammatory responses via RIPK1.
ZBP1 mediates RIPK3-dependent induction of apoptotic and necroptotic cell death 
pathways during IAV infection
Previous studies identified RIPK3 as a critical regulator determining cell death via 
necroptotic or apoptotic pathways (24, 25). BMDMs and fibroblasts lacking RIPK3 or both 
RIPK3 and caspase-8 or RIPK3 and FADD were fully resistant to IAV-induced cell death, 
confirming a critical role of RIPK3 in mediating ZBP1-dependent cell death (Fig. 3A to C 
and fig. S5A). Necroptosis is executed by the RIPK3 substrate mixed lineage kinase like 
(MLKL) (26). However, cell death comparable to WT levels was observed in Mlkl−/− 
BMDMs and fibroblasts infected with IAV, demonstrating that MLKL is dispensable for 
ZBP1- and RIPK3-dependent cell death (Fig. 3A to C and fig. S5A). ZBP1 also promotes 
apoptosis during IAV infection since activation of caspase-8, caspase-3 and caspase-7 was 
abrogated in Zbp1−/− BMDMs compared to WT BMDMs infected with IAV (Fig. 3D). 
Robust activation of both caspase-1 and caspase-8 was observed in Mlkl−/− BMDMs 
infected with IAV and inhibition of these caspase activities using zIETD-FMK prevented 
IAV-induced cell death in Mlkl−/− BMDMs (Fig. 3E and fig. S5B to D). Activation of

 multiple, complementary cell death pathways in IAV-infected cells was further confirmed by 
simultaneous inhibition of apoptosis, pyroptosis and necroptosis in WT BMDMs with the 
caspase-8 inhibitor zIETD-FMK plus MLKL inhibitor GW806742X (27). Treatment with 
these inhibitors prevented WT BMDMs from undergoing cell death during IAV infection 
(Fig. 3E). Inhibition of either apoptosis or necroptosis in WT and Casp1−/− BMDMs was 
unable to block IAV-induced cell death (Fig. 3E and fig. S5D). These results collectively 
demonstrate parallel contribution of pyroptosis, necroptosis and apoptosis in the execution 
of IAV-induced cell death governed by ZBP1.
ZBP1 regulates cell death in response to both mouse-adapted and seasonal strains of IAV, 
but not in response to RNA viruses belonging to Paramyxoviriadae and Rhabdoviridae 
family
In addition to mouse adapted PR8 virus, ZBP1 broadly regulates cell death in response to 
IAV of different species- and strain-specificity since Zbp1−/− fibroblasts were protected from 
cell death during infection with mouse adapted Influenza A/X31 (H3N2) as well as non-
mouse adapted seasonal strains Influenza A/Brisbane/59/2007 (H1N1) and A/Switzerland/
9715293/2013 (H3N2) (Fig. 4A to F). Unlike different strains of IAV, cell death and 
inflammatory cytokine production occurred independently of ZBP1 in BMDMs infected 
with other negative–sense RNA viruses, VSV, Sendai virus (SeV) and respiratory syncytial 
virus (RSV) (Fig. 4G and fig. S6). Moreover, transfection of synthetic, IAV or mammalian-
derived ssRNA species as well as the dsRNA ligand poly(I:C) and dsDNA ligand 
poly(dA:dT) induced comparable levels of cell death in WT and Zbp1−/− BMDMs (fig. S7A 
to C). Together, these data highlighted an IAV-specific role for ZBP1 in initiating cell death 
responses.
ZBP1 is a sensor of IAV nucleoprotein (NP) and polymerase subunit PB1
To investigate potential interaction of ZBP1 with IAV proteins, endogenous ZBP1 was 
immunoprecipitated from IAV-infected cells and probed for interacting IAV proteins. 
Immunoblotting for IAV M1, NS1 and HA proteins did not show any detectable levels of 
protein interaction (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, the IAV nucleoprotein (NP) and RNA 
polymerase subunit PB1 were co-precipitated from WT, but not Zbp1−/− fibroblasts infected 
with IAV (Fig. 5B). Conversely, immunoprecipitation of NP or PB1 from lysates of IAV-
infected fibroblasts also showed co-precipitation of these proteins with ZBP1, confirming 
interaction of endogenous ZBP1 with NP and PB1 (Fig. 5C). ZBP1, PB1 and NP were 
observed in both nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions from infected cells at 8hr post infection 
indicating that ZBP1 interaction with viral proteins can occur in either or both of these 
compartments (Fig. 5D). Overexpression of PB1 or NP in ZBP1-expressing 293T cells also 
demonstrated interaction of these viral proteins with ZBP1 (Fig. 5E).
In order to map the domains with which ZBP1 interacts with IAV proteins, various deletion 
mutants of ZBP1 with HA tag were generated and overexpressed in 293T cells (Fig. 5F). 
Efficient co-immunoprecipitation of PB1 or NP proteins with WT ZBP1 and ZBP1 lacking 
the RHIM, but not with ZBP1 lacking the C-terminal domain, demonstrated the importance 
of the C-terminal domain of ZBP1 for its interaction with IAV proteins (Fig. 5G and H). In 
addition to the C-terminal domain, the Zα domain of ZBP1 was also required for interaction

 with PB1 (Fig. 5G). Collectively, we identified ZBP1 as a sensor of influenza virus proteins 
that can trigger both cell death and inflammatory responses during infection.
ZBP1 promotes inflammatory responses and epithelial damage during IAV infection in vivo
The physiological relevance of ZBP1 in regulating pathogenesis of IAV infection was 
assessed in WT and Zbp1−/− mice infected with approximately one LD50 of PR8 virus. 
Remarkably, Zbp1−/− mice were protected from mortality during IAV infection while 30% 
of WT mice succumbed to infection (Fig. 6A). Zbp1−/− mice also showed a significant 
reduction in weight loss and morbidity during the early phase of infection compared to WT 
mice (Fig. 6B). However, viral titers were significantly higher in Zbp1−/− mice at day 7 pi 
consistent with the notion that cell death destroys the niche necessary for virus replication 
(Fig. 6C). The defective viral clearance observed in Zbp1−/− mice led to increased weight 
loss at later stages of infection and these mice showed delayed recovery from infection 
compared to WT animals (Fig. 6B). In agreement with our in vitro findings, inflammatory 
responses as well as epithelial damage was markedly reduced in Zbp1−/− mice infected with 
IAV (Fig. 6D and E). While severe and extensive inflammatory responses characterized by 
diffuse intra-alveolar infiltrates of neutrophils and macrophages and perivascular 
accumulations of lymphocytes and granulocytes were observed in the lungs of WT mice, 
these responses were reduced in Zbp1−/− mice on day 7 pi (Fig. 6D and E). Collectively, 
these data demonstrated a critical role of ZBP1 in regulating pathogenesis and 
immunopathology during acute IAV infection by controlling both cell death and 
inflammatory responses.
DISCUSSION
Cell fate decisions are well integrated into antiviral immune responses during an infection 
and are critical for elimination of replicating viruses. Although cell death constitutes a major 
antiviral host defense mechanism during IAV infection, exaggerated responses often leads to 
severe clinical disease and mortality as exemplified by the substantial damage to the lungs 
and destruction of respiratory epithelium observed in autopsy samples from the 1918 
influenza pandemic (28). Despite the importance of epithelial cell death in determining 
disease outcome during acute IAV infection, the host factors regulating cell death responses 
are less characterized.
The critical role of type I IFN signaling in potentiating IAV-induced apoptosis in MEFs via 
activation of the FADD–caspase-8 signaling axis has been reported (29). Induction of 
IFNAR1–RIPK3-dependent necroptosis was also demonstrated in both MEFs and 
macrophages when FADD–caspase-8 signaling was inactivated (30, 31). Although IFN 
Stimulated Gene Factor 3 (ISGF3) complex was recognized as a critical promoter of 
necroptosis, the IFN-stimulated gene mediating necroptosis and inflammatory responses in 
macrophages remained elusive (31). In addition to these in vitro studies, pathogenic 
potential of type I IFN signaling in mediating uncontrolled inflammatory response and 
epithelial cell death was also demonstrated during IAV infection in vivo (32). Our study has 
now identified ZBP1 as the IFN-inducible protein regulating both inflammatory responses 
and cell death during IAV infection in vitro and in vivo.

 The RHIM domains of ZBP1 associate with RHIM domains of both RIPK1 and RIPK3 to 
mediate NFκB activation and cell death responses (14, 20, 21). Consistent with these 
findings, we observed a critical role for ZBP1–RIPK1 axis in mediating proinflammatory 
responses during IAV infection. Moreover, ZBP1 regulation of cell death in IAV-infected 
cells is mediated via RIPK3. Of note, while our manuscript was in revision Nogusa et al. 
reported RIPK3-dependent activation of parallel necroptotic and apoptotic pathways in IAV-
infected cells (33). Although this study demonstrate the importance of RIPK3 in driving cell 
death during IAV-infection, the upstream receptors and signaling pathways regulating 
RIPK3 were not identified.
Despite being identified as a DNA sensor, it is still unclear whether ZBP1 functions as a 
pathogen sensor during an infection. Our study has now identified a role for ZBP1 in the 
recognition of an RNA virus, and linked it to both immune and cell death responses to 
clinically relevant IAV infection. Innate sensors of IAV have been well characterized, 
however all known IAV-receptors recognize viral RNA in infected cells (2). Notably, our 
study demonstrates ZBP1 as an innate sensor of IAV proteins regulating antiviral innate 
immune responses.
After our discovery of IAV-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation almost a decade ago 
(16), multiple studies have investigated the molecular and cellular mechanisms regulating 
inflammasome assembly in response to IAV infection (17–19, 34–36). The importance of 
IAV M2 ion channel protein, RIG-I, type I IFN signaling, RIPK3 and RNaseL in mediating 
inflammasome activation during IAV infection have been demonstrated (18, 19, 34, 36). Our 
data demonstrating an IAV-specific role for IFNAR–ZBP1 axis in the regulation of NLRP3 
inflammasome activation will help to reconcile these findings. While both RIG-I and 
RNaseL mediate type I IFN production necessary for induction of ZBP1, RIPK3 associates 
with ZBP1 to transduce downstream signals. The interconnected and complimentary nature 
of IAV-induced cell death pathways demonstrated in our study also helps to explain PB1-F2-
mediated NLRP3 inflammasome activation since PB1-F2 is regarded as the viral effector 
mediating cell death in IAV-infected cells (35, 37). Therefore, the identification of ZBP1 as 
an IAV-specific sensor helps to further resolve the molecular mechanisms regulating NLRP3 
inflammasome assembly during IAV infection.
The seemingly paradoxical observations of reduced mortality in Zbp1−/− mice in spite of 
increased viral titers are not unexpected, since previous studies in both humans and animal 
models reported exaggerated inflammatory response, substantial loss of pulmonary epithelia 
and acute lung injury as the major factors contributing to morbidity and mortality during 
pathogenic IAV infection (38, 39). An extensive systems analysis study also demonstrated 
elevated activation of inflammatory signaling networks as a signature that distinguishes 
lethal from sublethal IAV infections (40). Moreover, transcriptome analysis of lung samples 
from infected mice identified immune and cell death responses as the major factor 
distinguishing mild from highly pathogenic infections (41). Our data are in agreement with 
these studies demonstrating exaggerated immune response rather than direct viral damage as 
the key trigger potentiating mortality during IAV infection.

 Although BMDMs and fibroblasts do not represent the major cell types infected during IAV 
infection, the in vitro data obtained from these cells are validated by in vivo infections. 
However, further studies are warranted to identify the host and viral effectors as well as the 
precise molecular mechanism by which ZBP1-dependent cell death is executed in IAV-
infected cells. The relevance of human ZBP1 during IAV infection was also not assessed in 
our study. In vitro studies investigating the role of human ZBP1 during IAV infection are 
less feasible since most of the lung epithelial cell lines that support productive virus 
replication do not undergo IAV-induced cell death (37). Notably, proteomics analysis of 
human innate immunity interactome for type I IFN identified ZBP1 as one of the interacting 
proteins with antiviral activity (42). Moreover, human ZBP1 restricts replication of both 
human cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex-1 demonstrating functional importance of ZBP1 
in antiviral responses (43, 44). Since cell death, inflammatory responses and virus 
replication are intricately associated with each other, various host factors modulating 
susceptibility to infection as well as dosage of infection will be critical in determining the 
role of ZBP1 in disease progression. Identification of genetic lesions in ZBP1 locus in 
patient populations will be of great value and further studies in this direction are necessary 
to determine the importance of ZBP1 in pathogenesis of IAV in humans. Nevertheless, the 
insights gained from this study improve our understanding about the mechanisms regulating 
pathogenesis and prognosis of acute influenza virus infection and may lead to improved 
disease intervention strategies for the prevention and treatment of IAV infection.
Materials and Methods
Study Design
Animal studies were conducted under protocols approved by the St. Jude Children’s 
Research Hospital on the Use and Care of Animals. Age- and sex-matched, 6- to 8-weeks 
old WT and Zbp1−/− mice bred at the Animal Research Center at SJCRH were used for in 
vivo experiments. Infected mice were monitored and body weights were recorded daily, and 
mice exhibiting severe signs of disease or more than 30% weight loss relative to pre-
infection body weight were euthanized. Animals were euthanized at the indicated time 
points for lung harvest. Lung sections were processed at Veterinary Pathology Core at 
SJCRH and histopathological analysis was conducted by a pathologist blinded to 
experimental groups. No other blinding or randomization was performed.
Mice
Zbp1−/−, Ifnar1−/−, Stat1−/−, Irf9−/−, Aim2−/−, Nlrp3−/−, Nlrc4−/−, Casp1Null, Casp11−/−, 
Gsdmd−/−, Mavs−/−, Myd88−/−, Trif−/−, Tradd−/−, StingGt/Gt, Ripk3−/−, Ripk3−/−Casp8−/−, 
Ripk3−/−Casp8−/−Ripk1−/−, Ripk1KD/KD and Mlkl−/− mice have been described previously 
(13, 45–49). Tnfr−/− mice (Stock #003243) were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory.
Cell culture and stimulation
Cells were cultured overnight in antibiotic–free media before infection. The influenza A/
Puerto Rico/8/34 virus (PR8) generated by an eight-plasmid reverse genetics system was 
propagated in allantoic cavity of 9- to 11-day old embryonated SPF chicken eggs and viral 
titers were enumerated by standard plaque assays. BMDMs (MOI 25) and fibroblasts (MOI

 10) were infected with PR8 virus for 2 h. DMEM media containing 20% FBS was added 
after 2 h and samples were collected at indicated time points. For pharmacological 
inhibition, BMDMs were treated with 50μM Z-IETD-FMK (Millipore), 50 μM Z-VAD-
FMK (Calbiochem) and/or 1μM GW806742X (SYNkinase) at the same time as IAV 
infection. RSV Line 19F was grown in HEp-2 cell line.
Cytokine measurement
IFNβ and IL-18 were measured using ELISA kits (BioLegend (IFNβ); eBioscience (IL-18)). 
All other cytokines were measured by multiplex ELISAs (Millipore).
Generation of ZBP1 overexpressing cells
pVSVg, pEQ-Pam3(-E) and pMIGII plasmids encoding the Zbp1 gene are transfected into 
293T cells to generate retroviral stocks. Retroviral supernatants were harvested after 48 h of 
transfection and filtered through 0.4μm sterile filters. 293T cells were infected with the 
corresponding retroviral stocks in the presence of polybrene to generate cells stably 
expressing the respective ZBP1 proteins.
Co-immunoprecipitation
For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates were incubated with 3 μg of indicated primary 
antibodies on a rocking platform for 12–16h at 4°C. Protein A/G PLUS-Agarose (Santa 
Cruz) was added to the samples and incubated for another 2 h on the rocking platform. 
Agarose was centrifuged and washed 3 times with the lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitates were 
eluted in sample buffer after three washes in lysis buffer and then subjected to 
immunoblotting analysis.
Animal infection
WT and Zbp1−/− mice were anesthetized with 250 mg/kg Avertin followed by intranasal 
infection with 1000pfu (approximately one LD50) of PR8 virus in 30 μl PBS. Infected mice 
were observed over a period of 18 days for survival study. Lungs were harvested on day 7 pi 
and left lobe of the lungs was used for histopathological analysis. Formalin-preserved lungs 
were processed and embedded in paraffin according to standard procedures. Sections were 
stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) or IAV nucleoprotein. Lung viral titers were 
enumerated by standard plaque assays after homogenizing lungs in 1 ml PBS using a bead 
mill homogenizer (Qiagen).
Statistical analysis
GraphPad Prism 6.0 software was used for data analysis. Statistical significance was
