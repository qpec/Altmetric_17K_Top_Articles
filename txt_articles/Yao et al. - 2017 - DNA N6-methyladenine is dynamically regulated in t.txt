Chemical modifications on DNA molecules, such as 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydro-
xymethylcytosine, play important roles in the mammalian brain. A novel DNA adenine
modification, N(6)-methyladenine (6mA), has recently been found in mammalian cells.
However, the presence and function(s) of 6mA in the mammalian brain remain unclear. Here
we demonstrate 6mA dynamics in the mouse brain in response to environmental stress. We
find that overall 6mA levels are significantly elevated upon stress. Genome-wide 6mA and
transcriptome profiling reveal an inverse association between 6mA dynamic changes and a
set of upregulated neuronal genes or downregulated LINE transposon expression. Genes
bearing stress-induced 6mA changes significantly overlap with loci associated with neu-
ropsychiatric disorders. These results suggest an epigenetic role for 6mA in the mammalian
brain as well as its potential involvement in neuropsychiatric disorders.

 C
ovalent DNA modifications on the 5-carbon position of
cytosine,
such
as
5-methylcytosine
(5mC)
and
5-
hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), are well known to play
critical epigenetic roles in spatially and temporally modulating
neuronal gene expression in the mammalian central nervous
system (CNS)1, 2. A novel DNA adenine modification, N6-
methyladenine (6mA), which is prevalent in prokaryotes3, was
recently found in the genome of high eukaryotes, including green
algae, worms, fruit flies, frogs, zebrafish, pigs, and mice4–9.
Although evidence from these studies suggests potential epige-
netic roles for 6mA, its precise biological function(s) remain
elusive10. Furthermore, little is known about the presence and
functions of 6mA in the mammalian CNS.
Various genetic factors and environmental cues contribute to
mental illness11. Among these, exposure to chronic stress is one
of the strongest and most direct risk factors for developing
numerous
psychiatric
disorders
including
depression12,
13.
Compelling evidence support the fundamental roles of epigenetic
alterations in depression as changes in both DNA methylation
and histone modifications alter gene expression in brains14, 15.
The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is highly involved in complex cog-
nitive behavior, but is also sensitive to the adverse effects of stress
exposure16. In rodent experiments, chronic stress results in
dendritic atrophy and spine loss in the PFC17. A recent study
demonstrated that chronic social defeat stress could decrease
DNA methylation levels in PFC18. It remains to be determined
whether the DNA adenine modification 6mA is present in the
mammalian brain and if it is involved in the response to extrinsic
challenges such as stress.
Here we examined the dynamic changes of 6mA in mouse PFC
in response to stress. We found that global 6mA was significantly
elevated upon stress. Genome-wide 6mA and transcriptome
profiling revealed an inverse association of 6mA dynamic changes
with a set of upregulated neuronal genes or downregulated LINE
transposon
expression.
Genes
bearing
stress-induced
6mA
changes significantly overlap with loci associated with neu-
ropsychiatric disorders. These results together suggest a potential
epigenetic role for 6mA in the mammalian brain as well as its
possible involvement in mental illness.
Results
Chronic stress induces the accumulation of 6mA in mouse
PFC. It is well known that environmental exposure may induce
epigenetic changes. To understand the dynamics of 6mA in the
mouse brain, we employed a well-established paradigm for
chronic stress to model environmental exposure. We exposed 7-
to 8-week-old wild-type C57BL/6 adult male mice to normal or
restraint environments two hours per day in consecutive
14 days19, 20 (Supplementary Fig. 1a, b). We then performed the
forced swim test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST) to evaluate
stress responses in restrained and control mice. There was a
significant increase in immobility time in the restrained stressed
group in both the FST and TST, indicating that the restraint
environment successfully altered mouse behavior (Fig. 1a, b). In
order to test 6mA changes in response to stress, we applied the
highly sensitive ultra-performance liquid chromatography tan-
dem mass spectrometer (UHPLC-MS/MS) to precisely quantify
6mA dynamic changes upon stress in several brain regions
involved in stress response, including the PFC, hippocampus
(HIP), amygdala (AMY), and hypothalamus (HYP). Interestingly,
although detectable 6mA was present in all of these brain regions,
only 6mA in PFC showed substantial and significant increase
from an average of 6.6 p.p.m. (6mA per million dA) to 25.5 p.p.m.
upon stress (Fig. 1c). Since PFC has been widely linked to critical
neuronal activities such as stress response21, 22, we validated the
6mA dynamic changes in genomic DNA isolated from control
and stressed mice PFC using a 6mA-specific antibody, whose
specificity to DNA 6mA has been extensively validated in pre-
vious publications4, 5, 7, 9, and by PCR using normal dATP or
6mA-modified dATP (Fig. 1d). Consistent with UHPLC results,
6mA was present in the PFC of wild-type mice and showed
~fourfold significant increase upon stress (Fig. 1d, e and
Supplementary Fig. 1c). These data indicate that 6mA is present
in mammalian brains and undergoes dynamic changes upon
stress.
Genome-wide
6mA

exposure.
To
understand the potential role of 6mA in stress response, we ran-
domly chose three pairs of control and stressed mice from three
independent stress experiments to profile genome-wide 6mA
dynamics in PFCs using a published 6mA-immunoprecipitation
(IP) protocol coupled with high-throughput sequencing6, 7, 9. We
ensured the specificity of the 6mA-IP using competitive elution
with excess 6mA-modified nucleotides. In order to identify sig-
nificant differential 6mA dynamic regions upon stress, we applied
published computational algorithms edgeR23 to compare nor-
malized 6mA read density differences between triplicated control
and stressed PFC groups across the mouse genome utilizing
500 bp bins based on the 6mA-IP resolution. Differential regions
with a p-value < 0.05 (−log10 p-value > 1.3, false discovery
rate<0.077) were considered significant. We identified 21,974
loss-of-6mA regions and 37,937 gain-of-6mA regions upon stress
(Fig. 2a, and Supplementary Data 1, 2). Genomic annotation of
these 6mA dynamic regions revealed substantial biased genomic
associations. For example, 65% of regions that gained 6mA upon
stress were associated with intergenic regions, which is the highest
enrichment vs. expected value (Fig. 2b). Intragenic gain-of-6mA
upon stress predominantly occurred at introns and was excluded
from most coding exons (33%-introns vs. 0.38%-exons, Fig. 2b).
The strong association between 6mA and introns and intergenic
regions was consistent with observations in mouse kidney7 and
embryonic stem cells9. Additionally, 38% of intragenic loss-of-
6mA occurred at introns, among the highest enrichment vs.
expected value, and 59% of loss-of-6mA were identified at
intergenic regions (Fig. 2c). The fact that gain-of-6mA and loss-
of-6mA had differential enrichment at intergenic regions or
introns vs. expected values may indicate the differential roles of
6mA at these genomic regions. The 6mA reads ratio (stressed vs.
control) was plotted across the intragenic regions of genes bearing
dynamic 6mA changes upon stress, i.e., red plots (fold change>1)
indicate overall gain of 6mA upon stress whereas blue plots (fold
change<1) indicate loss of 6mA (Fig. 2d). Interestingly, more
6mA loss was observed around transcription start sites (TSS) than
gene bodies in genes bearing loss-of-6mA regions (Fig. 2d). In
contrast, gain-of-6mA showed substantially more gene body
enrichment than TSS in genes carrying gain-of-6mA regions
(Fig. 2d). These observations imply that gain- or loss-of-6mA has
differential roles on protein-coding genes.
6mA negatively correlates with LINE transposon expression.
To further dissect the association between 6mA dynamic changes
upon stress and intergenic transposon activities, we analyzed
intergenic 6mA dynamic regions at different classes of transposon
elements (Fig. 3). We found that 49.2% of intergenic gain-of-6mA
was annotated to long interspersed nuclear element (LINE)
transposons, which is the most highly enriched transposon over
expected value (Fig. 3a). In contrast, only 8.8% of loss-of-6mA
regions were located on LINEs, while 33.9% enriched at simple
repeats (Fig. 3b). N(6)-methyladenine has been shown to mod-
ulate transposon expression in Drosophila6 and target LINE

 transposons in mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC)9. Stress could
also substantially alter transposon expression in mouse PFC
(Supplementary Data 3). Expression of transposons, such as
LINEs, has been proposed to play important roles in stress
response in the mammalian brain24. Since 49.2% of intergenic
gain-of-6mA upon stress were located on LINEs and highly
enriched than expected values (Fig. 3c), which was not found in
the loss-of-6mA regions (Fig. 3d), we sought to investigate gain-
of-6mA association with LINE expression by RNA-seq. 103 of
120 expressed LINEs in PFC had significant 6mA changes upon
stress, with 82 (79.6%) showing increased 6mA. Importantly, the
majority (74 out of 82, 90.2%) of LINEs with gain-of-6mA are
downregulated upon stress (Fig. 3e). The percentage of down-
regulated LINEs bearing increased 6mA was significantly more
enriched than observed in short interspersed nuclear element
(SINE) transposons (χ2 test, p < 0.001). These data indicate an
inverse association between gain-of-6mA and LINE expression
upon stress. This is consistent with strong enrichment of gain-of-
6mA annotations at LINE elements relative to expected values
(Fig. 3a).
To validate the dynamic 6mA regions identified by 6mA-IP-
seq, we employed a published restriction enzyme digestion
method which takes advantage of the 6mA-sensitive restriction
enzyme DpnI that preferentially cleaves methylated adenine at
GATC/CATC/GATG sites25. Equal amounts of DpnI-digested
DNA and undigested control DNA were subjected to quantitative
polymerase
chain
reaction
(qPCR)
analyses
with
primers
targeting 6mA dynamic regions identified by 6mA-IP. The
percentage of 6mA in either control or stressed PFC can be
assessed by qPCR amplification and normalized to undigested
DNA control (digested/undigested)4, 25. Loci with lower 6mA
modification upon stress would hinder DpnI digestion, resulting
in higher PCR fold changes than control. We validated 16
random gain- or loss-of-6mA loci annotated to intragenic or
intergenic regions identified by 6mA-IP-seq and found consistent
6mA dynamic changes upon stress (Supplementary Figs. 2, 3a, b).
Furthermore, we confirmed four additional loss-of-6mA regions
annotated in genes involved in neurodevelopment and behavior
(Supplementary Fig. 3c). Importantly, no significant difference
was found in random loci without 6mA changes, indicating the
reproducibility and reliability of 6mA differential region identi-
fication (Supplementary Fig. 3d). However, although DpnI can
cleave fully methylated adenine at GATC/CATC/CATG to
indicate specific methylated adenine in these sites, methylated
adenines outside these cutting sites are beyond the scope of DpnI-
based 6mA detection, which we could not validate here. Finally,
we
confirmed
differential
6mA
regions
by
an
additional
computational package (DESeq2)26, and found substantial and
significant overlap between 6mA differential regions identified by
DESeq2 and edgeR that was initially used to identify differential
6mA regions. Taken together, these analyses confirm dynamic
6mA regions upon stress identified by 6mA-IP-seq.
N(6)-methyladenine negatively correlates with a group of
neuronal gene expression. To further link 6mA dynamics and
gene expression, global transcriptome changes in PFC upon stress
were assessed by RNA-seq (Supplementary Data 4). Gene

 Ontology (GO) analyses revealed enrichment for numerous bio-
logical pathways involved in neuronal functions in the cohort of
upregulated genes (Supplementary Fig. 4a). In contrast, these
terms were not found in the GO analysis of downregulated genes
(Supplementary Fig. 4b), indicating that many critical neuronal
genes were upregulated in response to stress. To investigate the
potential roles of 6mA in the stress response, we computed the
overall 6mA reads ratio at significant intragenic gain- or loss-of-
6mA regions per gene between stressed and control PFC, and
further subcategorized these genes into four groups: gain-of-
6mA/upregulated,
gain-of-6mA/downregulated,
loss-of-6mA/
upregulated, and loss-of-6mA/downregulated genes. Importantly,
GO analyses revealed that only upregulated genes bearing sig-
nificant loss-of-6mA were strongly associated with biological
pathways (top 15 terms based on fold enrichment) related to
neuronal development and neuronal functions, such as learning,
behavior, neurogenesis, and axon development, which have been
shown to play important roles in the brain stress response27, 28
(Fig. 4a, b and Supplementary Data 5). Cross-examination of the
relationship between genes and GO terms suggested that a sub-
stantial number of upregulated genes related to behavior were
also enriched for other biological functions such as learning and
neuron projection development, suggesting that these genes could
be involved in multiple biological pathways orchestrating stress
response (Fig. 4c). On the other hand, no biological terms related
to neuronal functions were found in the other groups of genes
(Supplementary Fig. 5a–c). Thus, our findings suggest a specific
inverse association between intragenic loss-of-6mA and a set of
critical upregulated neuronal genes in response to stress. This
data echoes the observation that loss-of-6mA regions were

Crosstalk between 6mA and other epigenetic mechanisms. In
order to explore the mechanistic roles of 6mA in gene regulation,
we investigated the potential correlation between 6mA distribu-
tion and enhancer regions and their signature histone modifica-
tions29. Overall, 6mA levels in both control and stressed PFC
samples appeared to be significantly depleted in both general
enhancers and cortex-specific enhancers compared to non-
enriched input (Supplementary Fig. 6a). Stress further sig-
nificantly decreased 6mA levels in these regions, implying that
altered 6mA upon stress could impact enhancer activity in mouse
brains (Supplementary Fig. 6b). H3K27ac and H3K4me1 are
associated with enhancers and active promoters29. Consistent
with enhancer regions, 6mA was also depleted at H3K27ac and
H3K4me130 regions (Supplementary Fig. 6c). In addition, 6mA
was also depleted at Pol II binding sites, consistent with its
negative correlation with transcription. Interestingly, although the
same trend (further 6mA depletion upon stress) was observed in
H3K27Ac and H3K4me1, stress-induced 6mA depletion was not
significant (Supplementary Fig. 6d). This observation suggested
that 6mA dynamic changes in response to stress were more
specific at cis-regulatory regions.
Recent studies suggest that DNA methylation, especially non-
canonical CpH methylation (H=A, C or T), plays unique roles in
neuronal functions31, 32. We explored the correlation between
cytosine methylation and adenine methylation in the context of
neurons and non-neurons using a genome-wide methylated DNA
immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) data set in mouse cortex33.
Interestingly, methylated cytosine (mC) was strongly enriched
at loss-of-6mA regions but only showed modest distributions at
gain-of-6mA regions (Supplementary Fig. 7a). The specific
enrichment of mC at regions with high 6mA levels in control,

 which lose 6mA under stress, could indicate co-existence of these
modifications and coordination of repressive roles. Intriguingly,
the correlation between mC and 6mA appears to be preferential
in neurons, as loss-of-6mA regions have almost two-fold higher
mC levels in neurons than non-neuronal cells (Supplementary
Fig. 7b). Consistently, global 6mA profiles in control PFC
demonstrated a stronger correlation with 5mC than stressed PFC,
and the 5mC profile was closer to 6mA profiles in neuronal cells
than non-neuronal cells (Supplementary Fig. 8a). Given that a
substantial number of gain-of-6mA regions upon stress were
annotated in LINE transposons, we tested whether cytosine
methylation was also altered in LINE transposons. Interestingly,
MeDIP coupled with qPCR detected a significant increase of
methylation in L1td134 upon stress (Supplementary Fig. 8b),
suggesting potential crosstalk between 6mA and 5mC in LINE
transposons. Furthermore, the correlation between cytosine and
adenine methylation was supported by the top motifs found in
intragenic regions upregulated with loss-of-6mA (Supplementary
Fig. 9). “AC” and “CA” are major motifs within these regions in
PFC. Moreover, these motifs were predicted to be recognized by
various transcription factors, such as Egr2, Foxh1 and Hif2a
(Supplementary Fig. 9), suggesting that 6mA dynamics may serve

 as docking sites to modulate transcription factor binding in
response to stress. In fact, 6mA is enriched in histone modifier
binding sites, such as Polycomb PRC1 component BMI1 Proto-
Oncogene, Polycomb Ring Finger (Bmi1), but depleted in another
Polycomb protein RING1B (Supplementary Fig. 10a), implying
potential and specific crosstalk between 6mA and other epigenetic
mechanisms. Significant loss-of-6mA in stress was found at
Bmi1-binding sites (Supplementary Fig. 10b), and Bmi1 has been
shown to mark certain enhancer regions35. This observation was
consistent with the depletion of 6mA from enhancers in normal
mouse PFC (Supplementary Fig. 6).
Dynamic 6mA is associated with depression-linked loci. To
shed light on the functional relevance of 6mA dynamics in the
stress response and human neuropsychiatric disorders, we
obtained human depression-associated genes related to the 17
most significant SNPs36, and correlated their mouse orthologs
with 6mA dynamic genes upon stress in our study. Interestingly,
14 out of 17 (82.4%) depression-associated genes significantly
overlapped with 6mA dynamic genes upon stress (Fig. 5a, Pear-
son’s χ2 tests). Importantly, the same number of random genes
selected to match the GC content, gene size, and neuronal
expression of these depression-associated genes did not sig-
nificantly overlap with 6mA dynamic genes upon stress (Supple-
mentary Fig. 11). To further investigate whether 6mA is associated
with other neuropsychiatric disorders, we obtained genes asso-
ciated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD)37, schizophrenia
(SCZ)38, aortic lesion, and obesity39. N(6)-methyladenine dynamic
genes showed significant and specific overlap with ASD and SCZ
genes (Fig. 5a, Pearson’s χ2 test), but not with genes involved in
aortic lesion, obesity39, or an equal number of randomly selected
refseq genes (Fig. 5b, Pearson’s χ2 test). Together, these data
suggest a potential link between this novel DNA modification and
mental illness. Furthermore, genes with the top 10,000 depression-
associated SNPs also displayed significant overlap with 6mA
dynamic genes but not with an equal number of random genes
(Supplementary Fig. 12a, Pearson’s χ2 tests). We generated three
random gene lists to match the GC content, gene size, and neu-
ronal expression to the full list of depression-associated genes, and
calculated their overlap with 6mA dynamic genes in stress (Sup-
plementary Fig. 12b–d). Similar to the top 17 most significant
SNPs, the overlap between 6mA dynamic genes in stress and the
full list of depression-associated genes is also specific and sig-
nificant, as all three random gene lists did not show significant
overlap with 6mA dynamic genes (Supplementary Fig. 12b–d,
Pearson’s χ2 tests). These data indicate a strong association
between 6mA and loci linked to neuropsychiatric disorders.
Discussion
N(6)-methyladenine is relatively well characterized in bacteria
and is involved in host defense against bacteriophages and
transposons, modulation of DNA and chromosome replication,

 green algae, worms, and fruit flies, was recently documented4–6.
Our data presented here for the first time demonstrate the pre-
sence and dynamics of 6mA in the mouse brain in response to
stress. Genome-wide 6mA profiling indicates an inverse associa-
tion of 6mA dynamics with a group of neuronal genes involved in
the stress response as well as transposon LINE expression. N(6)-
methyladenine appears to be depleted in cis-regulatory elements
and correlates with cytosine methylation and other epigenetic
regulation in the mammalian CNS. Interestingly, the group of
genes in mouse PFC bearing dynamic changes in 6mA in
response to stress significantly and specifically associate with
genes involved in neuropsychiatric disorders.
Increasing evidence indicate that physiological and psycholo-
gical stress could change DNA methylation at critical genes
related to stress in mouse brains18, 40, 41. Furthermore, DNA
methylation alterations are further supported by similar obser-
vations in postmortem human brains of patients diagnosed with
major depressive disorder who committed suicide42. PFC is
responsible for highest-order cognitive abilities and is particularly
susceptible to chronic stress and plays significant roles in
depression22. Our results demonstrate specific accumulation of
6mA in PFC under chronic stress, which further supports the
critical roles of PFC in the stress response and suggest the
potential importance of 6mA dynamics during this process.
Interestingly, it has been suggested that chronic stress could
induce morphological and molecular changes within PFC to
render cognitive rigidity and increased vigilance28. These changes
are PFC specific, and could be conveyed by the rapid alteration of
6mA upon stress. It is important to note that the stress condition
applied in our current study only represents one of many
unknown environmental paradigms which could spatially and
temporally trigger 6mA dynamics to deal with environmental
changes at the epigenetic level. Thus, further studies will be
important to precisely elucidate the roles of 6mA in specific brain
regions in response to various stimuli.
Earlier experiments have found that transfecting a gene with
6mA modifications could result in an almost 30-fold decrease in
transcription factor binding in mammalian cells, implying
potential roles for 6mA in transcription43. In the current study,
we show that significant loss of intragenic 6mA in mouse PFC
upon stress inversely correlates with a group of upregulated genes
enriched in neuronal functions, neurodevelopment and behavior.
These data indicate that the presence of 6mA on these genes
could play a negative transcription role under normal conditions
in mouse PFC, consistent with a recent study in mESCs9. Inter-
estingly our data suggest a general depletion of 6mA in enhancer
regions and Pol II binding sites (Supplementary Fig. 5c), indi-
cating that 6mA repression could be in part due to its modulation
of intronic cis-regulatory regions. Genome-wide 6mA distribution
appears to be tissue-specific, as dynamic 6mA changes are highly
enriched in “CA” motifs in mouse PFC compared to “GA” motifs
in static mouse kidney7. Increasing evidence supports that non-
CpG methylation (mCH, H=A/C/T) more directly regulates
genes in neurons, with mC in the “CA” context as a major
motif32. It is important to further understand the precise and
tissue-specific roles of 6mA and investigate the potential link
between cytosine and adenine methylation.
Our finding that the group of genes bearing dynamic 6mA
changes in response to stress significantly and specifically over-
laps with genes involved in depression, SCZ, and ASD is parti-
cularly intriguing. Potential 6mA “readers”, “writers”, and
“erasers” that maintain 6mA homeostasis in the CNS could play
key roles in maintaining normal brain function. It will be
important to identify the 6mA functional players in future stu-
dies. Thus, aberrant 6mA in response to stress could contribute to
neuropsychiatric diseases by ectopically recruiting transcription
factors and altering target expression. Therefore, our finding
provides the first link between this novel DNA adenine methy-
lation and neuropsychiatric disorders.
Methods
Animals. All wild-type mice had the C57BL/6 genetic background. All mice used in
this study were male and 7–8 weeks old. All animal procedures were performed
according to protocols approved by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
at Emory University.
Chronic restraint stress. Mice were individually placed into a customized, well-
ventilated 50-ml conical tube (Corning Inc., Corning, NY) daily from 10 a.m. to
12 p.m. for 2 h in their home cages for 2 weeks. The restrained mice could move
from the supine to prone position, but were not able to move forward or backward.
The non-restrained control mice remained undisturbed in their home cages. After
restraint stress, mice were released from the tube and returned to their home cages.
Three independent stress experiments were performed with nine animals each in
control and stressed groups per experiment.
Forced swim test. The FST was performed as described previously44. In brief, each
mouse was placed in a glass cylinder (20 cm high, 15 cm in diameter) with warm
water (23–25 °C, 14 cm in depth) for 6 min. The water in the glass cylinder was
replaced with fresh water of the same temperature for each individual test. Mice
were gently dried after removal from the bath and returned to their home cages.
Immobility time was recorded when the animal was floating in the water or making
the minimum movement necessary to float in the water. An unpaired t-test was
used and error bars represente mean±SEM. Investigators were blinded to groups
and genotypes.
Tail suspension test. The TST was performed according to the method outlined
in previous reports with a minor modification45. Each mouse was suspended by
adhesive tape placed ∼1 cm from the tip of the tail. The distance between the tip of
the tail of each mouse and the desktop was about 45 cm. Each mouse was sus-
pended for 6 min, and the immobility time was recorded. Unpaired t-test was used
and error bars represent mean±SEM. Investigators were blinded to groups and
genotypes.
Genomic DNA and RNA isolation. Mouse prefrontal cortexes were dissected from
the brain immediately after the behavior tests. Genomic DNA was isolated from
different brain tissues in 600 μl of digestion buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5,
5 mM EDTA, 0.2% SDS, 200 mM NaCl), then treated with Proteinase K (Thermo)
at 55 °C overnight. The second day, 600 μl of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol
(25:24:1 saturated with 10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA) (P-3803, Sigma) was
added to samples, mixed completely, and centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 rpm.
The aqueous layer was transferred into a new Eppendorf tube and precipitated with
600 μl of isopropanol. The pellet was washed with 75% ethanol, air-dried, and
resuspended with Nuclease-Free Water (Ambion). DNA samples were treated
extensively with an RNase cocktail (Ambion) to remove contaminating RNA. PFC
samples were homogenized in Trizol (Invitrogen) and processed according to the
manufacturer’s instructions for total RNA isolation.
N(6)-methyladenine antibody specificity. The specificity of 6mA antibody
(Synaptic systems) was extensively validated to ensure that it did not cross-react
with 5mC, 3mA, or denatured 1mA5. It displayed poor reactivity with RNA
molecules5. In addition, consistent with our data, a recent publication9 used this
LC–MS approach to analyze DNA modifications in mouse embryonic stem cells.
No 1-methyladenine (1mA), 3-methyladenine (3mA), or 3-methyl-cytosine (3mC)
was detected in the mouse genome. The specificity of this antibody was validated
by PCR using normal dATP or 6mA-modified dATP (Fig. 1d).
N(6)-methyladenine dot blot. Dot blot was performed on a Bio-Dot Apparatus
(#170-6545, BIO-RAD) as described previously46 using a specific 6mA antibody
(Synaptic Systems, cat. no. 202 003) incubating overnight at 4 °C. Horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated antibody to rabbit (1:5000, #A-0545, Sigma) was used as a
secondary antibody, and incubated for 45 min at 20–25 °C. Standard DNA tem-
plates were loaded (D5405, ZYMO) for quantification and to verify antibody
specificity. The density of each dot signal was quantified by ImageJ software47. An
unpaired t-test was used and error bars represent mean±SEM. Extensive RNase
treatments were performed to ensure complete removal of RNA contamination.
UHPLC-MS/MS analysis. Genomic DNA of PFC, HIP, AMY, and HYP were
enzymatically digested into single nucleosides with a mixture of DNaseI, calf
intestinal phosphatase, and snake venom phosphodiesterase I at 37 °C for 12 h.
After enzymes were removed by ultrafiltration, the digested DNA was subjected to
UHPLC-MS/MS analysis. HPLC fractionation of mouse m6dA and UHPLC-
QTOF-MS/MS analysis were performed as described previously6. The 6mA levels

 in control PFC (6.6 p.p.m.) and stressed PFC (25.5 p.p.m.) had similar ranges as
observed in mouse embryonic stem cells9.
N(6)-methyladenine immunoprecipitation. Genomic DNA was sonicated to
200–300-bp fragments for IP-based 6mA enrichment using rabbit polyclonal
antibody raised against 6mA (Synaptic Systems) at 1:100 in 1× IP buffer containing
100 Mm Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 Mm NaCl, 0.05% Triton X-100. The IP was con-
ducted with overnight platform rotation at 4 °C without beads. Dynabeads Protein
G (Novex by Life Technologies, REF 10009D 30 mg/ml) were added, and the
mixture was rotated at 4 °C for 2 h. Beads were washed six times at room tem-
perature with 1× ice-cold IP buffer, 5 min each with rotation. After the wash, the
DNA fragments were eluted by either proteinase K digestion or 6mA competition.
For proteinase K digestion-based elution, the beads were treated with digestion
buffer containing 1× TE, 0.25% SDS, and 0.25% Proteinase K (2.5 mg/ml) at 55 °C
and centrifuged at 1400 rpm for 2 h. The eluted DNA fragments were extracted
once with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol=25:24:1, followed by extraction with
chloroform alone, and then precipitated with glycogen, NaOAc pH 5.2, and 100%
ethanol at −20 °C for at least 2 h or overnight. For 6mA base competition-based
elution, the beads were treated with 1× IP buffer with 2.6 mM 6mA three times for
30 min each at room temperature. The eluted DNA fragments were precipitated
without extraction with phenol and chloroform.
N(6)-methyladenine DpnI digestion and qPCR. DpnI digestion and qPCR were
conducted as previously described25. Briefly, restriction enzyme digestion was
performed by treating 1 µg of genomic DNA with 5 µl of 5 U/µl DpnI restriction
enzyme (NEB) at 37 °C for 1 h. The digested DNA and non-digested DNA (5 ng)
were subjected to qPCR using FastStart SYBR Green Master kit.
Library preparation and high-throughput sequencing. Enriched DNA from
triplicate 6mA-IP were subjected to library construction using the NEBNext ChIP-
Seq Library Prep Reagent Set from Illumina according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Briefly, 25 ng of input genomic DNA or experimental enriched DNA
were used for each library construction. DNA fragments (150–300 bp) were
selected by AMPure XP Beads (Beckman Coulter) after adapter ligation. An Agi-
lent 2100 BioAnalyzer was used to quantify amplified DNA, and qPCR was applied
to accurately quantify library concentration. In total, 20 pM diluted libraries were
used for sequencing. Fifty cycle single-end sequencing reactions were performed
using Illumina HiSeq 2000. Image processing and sequence extraction were done
using the standard Illumina Pipeline.
RNA-seq libraries were generated from triplicate samples per condition using
the Illumina TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Kit v2 following the manufacturer’s
protocol. RNA-seq libraries were sequenced as 50-cycle paired-end runs using
Illumina HiSeq 2000.
Sample size and statistical analyses. Eighteen wild-type mice were randomly
divided into control and stressed groups. No particular animals were included or
excluded from the study. For 6mA profiling, three biological replicates (both
control and stressed mouse PFC DNA) from different batches of stress experiments
with consistent PFC 6mA increases were subjected to 6mA-IP-seq. RNA-seq was
also performed on three biological replicates. P values from Pearson’s χ2 tests and t-
tests are indicated in Figures and Figure legends. All statistical analyses were
performed in the R computational environment.
Bioinformatics analyses. Triplicated FASTQ sequence files from control and
stressed 6mA-IP in PFC were aligned to the mm9 reference genome using Bowtie
v1.1.248. Established computational algorithms (edgeR package in R/Bioconductor
environment) using quantile-adjusted conditional maximum likelihood methods
were used to compare three control and three stressed normalized 6mA read
density in 500 bp binned mouse genome (6mA-seq resolution) with the con-
sideration of sample variation. Differential regions with a p value<0.05 (false
discovery rate<0.077) were considered significant. The differential 6mA regions
were further validated by DESeq2, another widely utilized computational algo-
rithm26. Ngs.plot software was used to calculate 6mA and 5mC concatenated reads
on various genomic regions to plot average 6mA reads on gene bodies49. Anno-
tation analyses and expected values of genomic features were performed using the
HOMER suite50. Motif search and transcription factor prediction were performed
by regulatory sequence analysis tools51 or HOMER suite. RNA-seq reads were
aligned using TopHat v2.0.1352, and differential reads per kilobase of transcript per
million mapped reads (RPKM) expression values were extracted using Cuffdiff
v2.2.152. Genes with RPKM values more than 0.5 and log2 fold changes more than
0.1 were kept for transcriptome analyses. All differentially expressed genes were
tested for correlation to 6mA dynamic changes since stress could result in subtle
changes in expression. Gene ontology analyses were performed by Gene Ontology
Consortium53. Transposon expression was analyzed by TEtranscripts54. Circos plot
was generated by R-package GOplot55. The global Spearman correlations between
6mA and 5mC were performed by deepTools56.
Published datasets. Cortex-specific enhancer and cortex general enhancers were
obtained from the ENCODE project29 (http://chromosome.sdsc.edu/mouse/
download.html). Enhancer regions were determined as 250 bp flanking the summit.
Eight-week-old mouse cortex H3K27ac and h3K4me1 ChIP-seq data were obtained
from GSE4984729. Mouse anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) DNA methylation
(MeDIP-seq), Histone H3K27ac, and H3K4me1 ChIP-seq data were obtained from
GSE74965 and GSE74964, respectively33. Mouse brain AUTS2, Bmi1, and RING1B
ChIP-seq data were obtained from GSE6040930. The human loci related to
depression, SCZ, and ASD were converted to their mouse orthologs and overlapped
with loci bearing dynamic 6mA changes upon stress. All SRA files were down-
loaded, converted to FASTQ files and processed as described in the bioinformatics
methods section.
Data availability. The sequencing data have been deposited at Gene Expression
Omnibus under accession number GSE79543. Other data showing the significant
loss- and gain-of-6mA; stress-induced transposon expression; stress-induced gene
expression alteration and upregulated genes bearing significant loss-of-6mA are
shown in Supplementary Data 1–5. All other relevant data are available from the
corresponding author.
