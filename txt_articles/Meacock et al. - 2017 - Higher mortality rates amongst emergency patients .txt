lower probability of admission

Abstract
Objective: Patients admitted as emergencies to hospitals at the weekend have higher death rates than patients admitted
on weekdays. This may be because the restricted service availability at weekends leads to selection of patients with
greater average severity of illness. We examined volumes and rates of hospital admissions and deaths across the week for
patients presenting to emergency services through two routes: (a) hospital Accident and Emergency departments, which
are open throughout the week; and (b) services in the community, for which availability is more restricted at weekends.
Method: Retrospective observational study of all 140 non-specialist acute hospital Trusts in England analyzing
12,670,788 Accident and Emergency attendances and 4,656,586 emergency admissions (940,859 direct admissions
from primary care and 3,715,727 admissions through Accident and Emergency) between April 2013 and February
2014.Emergency attendances and admissions to hospital and deaths in any hospital within 30 days of attendance or
admission were compared for weekdays and weekends.
Results: Similar numbers of patients attended Accident and Emergency on weekends and weekdays. There were similar
numbers of deaths amongst patients attending Accident and Emergency on weekend days compared with weekdays
(378.0 vs. 388.3). Attending Accident and Emergency at the weekend was not associated with a significantly higher
probability of death (risk-adjusted OR: 1.010).
Proportionately fewer patients who attended Accident and Emergency at weekend were admitted to hospital (27.5% vs.
30.0%) and it is only amongst the subset of patients attending Accident and Emergency who were selected for admission
to hospital that the probability of dying was significantly higher at the weekend (risk-adjusted OR: 1.054).
The average volume of direct admissions from services in the community was 61% lower on weekend days compared to
weekdays (1317 vs. 3404). There were fewer deaths following direct admission on weekend days than weekdays (35.9 vs.
80.8). The mortality rate was significantly higher at weekends amongst direct admissions (risk-adjusted OR: 1.212) due to
the proportionately greater reduction in admissions relative to deaths.
Conclusions: There are fewer deaths following hospital admission at weekends. Higher mortality rates at weekends are
found only amongst the subset of patients who are admitted. The reduced availability of primary care services and the
higher Accident and Emergency admission threshold at weekends mean fewer and sicker patients are admitted at
weekends than during the week. Extending services in hospitals and in the community at weekends may increase the
number of emergency admissions and therefore lower mortality, but may not reduce the absolute number of deaths.

Introduction
The finding that patients admitted to hospital in an emer-
gency at the weekend have a higher mortality rate than
those admitted during the week is well documented.1–6
However, the cause of this ‘weekend effect’ is not known.

 The phenomenon has been attributed to reduced availabil-
ity of senior clinical staff and reduced access to investiga-
tive services in hospitals at weekends,3,4,7 but there is no
causal evidence establishing this link.8–12 Nevertheless, the
existing evidence has been used to support moves by the
NHS in England towards 7-day working.3,13
This leap from the detection of a statistical associ-
ation to a reorganization of the way in which the NHS
is provided and staffed has come under unprecedented
criticism.8,10,11,14,15
Numerous
commentaries
have
raised serious concerns over the interpretation of the
papers that have been used to underpin these service
changes, highlighting various alternative explanations
for the finding of increased mortality rates amongst
those admitted to hospital at weekends.
A major concern is that differences in the severity of
patients admitted to hospital at the weekend compared to
during the week may not be captured fully by the case-mix
variables available in administrative datasets.10,11,15 The
number of patients admitted to hospital in an emergency

may be because the population is less likely to seek emer-
gency care, Accident and Emergency (A&E) departments

directadmissionstohospital.Higherdeathratesamongthe
smaller number of patients who are admitted at weekends
might partly reflect a higher average severity of illness
amongst those who are admitted rather than excess avoid-
able deaths caused by poorer quality of care on admission.
Better understanding of how patients end up in hos-
pital on different days is required if we are to determine
whether the weekend effect is a matter for policy concern
or a statistical artefact.15 Our aim is to investigate whether
the weekend effect in mortality amongst admitted
patients reflects admission of fewer or sicker patients
who are at greater risk of dying. We analyse the variation
by day of the week in the volume of admissions and sub-
sequent mortality, stratifying patients by their route of
access to hospital. We exploit previously under-utilized
data on A&E attendances to investigate whether higher
mortality amongst the population of patients admitted to
hospital reflects a more stringent admission threshold. We
then examine the extent to which the limited availability
of services in the community at weekends leads to fewer
direct admissions and whether there is a higher mortality
rate amongst the restricted number of patients who are
admitted via this route.
Methods
Data source
We used individual patient-level data on 12,670,788
A&E attendances and 4,656,586 emergency admissions
from Hospital Episode Statistics between 1 April 2013
and 28 February 2014.16 We used a 11-month study
period as data were available for 1 April 2013 to 31
March 2014 and each patient was followed for 30 days
after attendance or admission to analyse mortality within
this subsequent period. We focused on attendances at
Type 1 units, which are consultant-led, multi-specialty
24-hour services with full resuscitation facilities and
designated accommodation for the reception of A&E
patients. These units exclude single specialty centres,
minor injury units and walk-in centres, and account for
99% of emergency admissions via A&E.17
The attendance records contain information on the
patient’s age, sex, ethnic group, diagnosis, arrival by
ambulance or other mode, whether the attendance is
a first or follow-up visit, where the incident occurred
(home, work, educational establishment or other public
place), the type of accident (including road traffic acci-
dent,
assault,
deliberate
self-harm,
sports
injury),
whether the attendance was patient-initiated or recom-
mended by a professional in another organization, the
date of attendance and whether the patient was
admitted, discharged or died in the A&E department.
The admission records contain information on the
patient’s age, sex, ethnic group, primary and secondary
diagnoses classified using ICD-10, whether the patient
was admitted from home or another institution, the
date of admission, and whether the patient was
admitted via A&E or directly by a GP, through a bed
bureau, or by a consultant in a scheduled ambulatory
clinic. Each record also contains the date of death if the
patient died in hospital.
We analysed attendance and admission records from
all 140 non-specialist acute Trusts in England. We
linked these records using an encrypted patient identi-
fier to the dates of death of all patients who had died in
any hospital in England between 1 April 2013 and 31
March 2014. We focused on deaths within 30 days of
attendance or admission.
To control for deprivation, we attached the Index of
Multiple Deprivation 2010 score to the attendance and
admission records using the patient’s lower-layer super
output area (LSOA) of residence.18 England is divided
into 32,844 LSOAs, with a mean population of
1500.19,20 We included all records for patients whose
area of residence in England was known, excluding
772 A&E attendances (0.006% of records) for which
risk-adjustment variables were missing.
Statistical analysis
Throughout our analysis we separate patients by their
route of admission to hospital, examining two distinct
groups. The first group we examine are patients who
access emergency services through A&E, which make
Meacock et al.
13
 up the majority of emergency admissions.17,21 This
includes patients directed by their GP to attend. To
examine the importance of selection effects amongst
the admitted population due to variations in clinical
decisions to admit, we focus initially on the entire
population of patients who attend A&E and then
restrict the analysis to the subset who are selected for
admission.
The second group consists of patients admitted dir-
ectly to hospital in an emergency (circumventing the
A&E department) by GPs, through a bed bureau or
by specialists in ambulatory clinics, termed ‘direct
admissions’ (HES admission method codes 22, 23 and
24). The availability of these community services is
more limited at the weekends compared to during the
week and we examine whether this leads to fewer direct
admissions and whether there is a higher mortality rate
amongst the restricted number of patients who are
admitted via this route.
Within these groups we compared the mean numbers
of A&E attendances, emergency admissions and deaths
per day between each day of the week and between
weekdays and weekend days using t-tests.
We used logistic regression to estimate the risk-
adjusted probability of dying within 30 days for the
entire population of patients attending A&E depart-
ments by day of the week. We then estimated the
risk-adjusted probability of being admitted to hospital
and the risk-adjusted probability of dying for the subset
of patients who are selected for admission. The case-
mix adjustment in these models included information
taken from the A&E attendance records on age, sex,
ethnicity, diagnosis, arrival mode, first or follow-up
visit, incident location, accident type, referral source,
deprivation quintile, month and hospital attended.
We also used logistic regression to estimate the risk-
adjusted probability of dying within 30 days of direct
admission by day of the week. The case-mix adjustment
in these models included information taken from the
admission records on age, sex, ethnicity, primary diag-
nosis (SHMI-grouped Clinical Classifications Software
category), Elixhauser (comorbidity) conditions, admis-
sion method, admission source, deprivation quintile,
month and admitting hospital.22–24 SHMI-grouped
Clinical Classifications Software is a tool for grouping
patients into a manageable number of clinically mean-
ingful categories using ICD-10 diagnosis codes.25,26
We compared each day to Wednesday and then esti-
mated another model comparing weekend admissions
to weekday admissions.
The analysis was undertaken using Stata version 13.
We clustered the error terms to account for the multiple
observations of some individuals using the Stata com-
mand ‘robust cluster(id)’ and summarized the good-
ness-of-fit of the models using the C-statistic.
Results
A&E department attendances
The average number of people attending A&E is high-
est on Monday and lowest on Friday (Table 1).
Average numbers of attendances on weekend days are
similar to weekdays.
The characteristics of patients attending A&E on
weekdays and weekends are given in online Appendix
1. A slightly higher proportion of patients attending
A&E at the weekend are children or younger adults,
but similar proportions are in the oldest age groups
(90þ) on weekend days and weekdays. Proportions of
patients with the most common presentations are simi-
lar on weekends and weekdays.
The average number of patients attending A&E on
weekend days and dying within 30 days is similar to
weekdays (Table 1). The crude death rate following
an A&E attendance is significantly lower at the week-
end compared to during the week (0.99% vs. 1.03%).
The risk adjustment model was strongly predictive of
mortality (C-statistic of 0.92). After adjusting for risk,
attending A&E at the weekend is not associated with a
significantly higher probability of mortality than attending
during the week (Table 1). Examining the results for each
day separately, attending A&E is associated with small
but statistically significant higher probabilities of mortality
for Sundays and Mondays compared to Wednesday
attendance. These increases in relative risk equate to abso-
lute increases in the risk of death of 0.034 percentage
points on Monday and 0.037 percentage points on
Sunday, from a baseline of 1.02% on a Wednesday.
Admissions via A&E departments
Results for the population of emergency patients who
are admitted to hospital when they attend A&E are
given in Table 2. The proportion of the patient
population attending A&E at the weekend admitted
to hospital compared to those attending during the
week is 2.6 percentage points lower. Consequently,
average numbers of admissions via A&E are 7%
lower for weekend days than for weekdays.
The risk adjustment model for the probability of
admission had a C-statistic of 0.83. The adjusted admis-
sion rate of patients attending A&E at the weekend
remains significantly lower compared to those attend-
ing during the week (OR: 0.946).
The risk adjustment model for the probability of mor-
tality amongst the subset of patients who are admitted
when attending A&E had a C-statistic of 0.91. Patients
admitted at the weekend have a significantly higher
probability of mortality compared to those admitted
during the week (OR: 1.054; CI: 1.040–1.069). These
results are similar regardless of whether risk-adjustment
14
Journal of Health Services Research & Policy 22(1)
 variables are taken from the A&E or inpatient records.
Examining the results for each day separately, admis-
sions on Sundays, Saturdays and Mondays are asso-
ciated with higher mortality compared to Wednesday
admissions. These are the days on which the patients
who attend A&E have the lowest risk-adjusted probabil-
ities of admission.
Direct admissions
The average number of direct admissions to hospital
from services in the community is fairly stable across
weekdays, but is 61% lower at weekends (Table 3).
The characteristics of patients directly admitted to hos-
pital on weekdays and weekends are given in online
Appendix 2. A higher proportion of patients directly
admitted at the weekend are children, younger adults
or very elderly (0–34 years or 90 and over) compared
to weekdays. The most common primary diagnoses
amongst patients directly admitted during the week are
abdominal pain, influenza and headaches. For those dir-
ectly admitted during the weekend, these are influenza,
abdominal pain and intestinal infections. The population
directly admitted at the weekend is less likely to have
most of the Elixhauser comorbidities reported.
The average number of patients directly admitted on
weekend days and dying within 30 days is significantly
lower than for weekdays (36 vs. 81) (Table 3). However,
due to the proportionally larger reduction in the
average number of direct admissions at the weekend,
the proportion of admissions that lead to death within
30 days is higher at weekends than weekdays (2.72% vs.
2.37%).
The model used to predict the probability of mortal-
ity produced a C statistic of 0.92. Adjusted mortality
rates for directly admitted patients are lowest for
Friday admissions (OR: 0.968) and highest for those
admitted on Sunday (OR: 1.278). Compared with
direct admissions on a weekday, the relative risk of
mortality within 30 days was 21.2% higher for direct
admissions at the weekend. This equates to a 0.488
percentage point increase in the risk of death, from a
baseline of 2.37% during the week.
Discussion
Main findings
Patients admitted to hospital as emergencies at the
weekend are known to have a higher rate of death
than patients admitted during the week. However, we
did not find higher mortality for the whole population
attending A&E departments at weekends. The weekend
effect was only apparent in the subset of patients who
are admitted to hospital, and was far stronger for
patients directly admitted from the community – who
were admitted in far smaller numbers at weekends –
than for patients admitted via A&E. These findings

 suggest a sicker population of patients is admitted to
hospital at weekends and that this selection effect is
partly responsible for the weekend effect.
Higher mortality rates amongst the population of
patients admitted to hospital in an emergency at week-
ends is driven by a reduction in the volumes of patients
admitted to hospital at the weekend rather than an
increase in the number of deaths. There were 7%
fewer admissions through A&E at weekends, which
was not explained by the patient characteristics that
we could control for. Hospital staff appear to apply a
more stringent admission threshold at weekends to
patients seeking emergency care in A&E. This raises
the possibility that the patient population admitted at
weekends is on average sicker than the population
admitted on weekdays, and that this difference is not
completely captured by standard risk adjustment using
administrative data.
The weekend effect is greatest amongst the patients
directly admitted to hospital, for whom the relative risk
of mortality was 21% higher at the weekend. However,
the number of admissions through this route was 61%
lower at weekends compared to weekdays and these
admissions represent just 11% (1317/(1317 þ 10526))
of total emergency admissions on a typical weekend
day. The lower volume of direct admissions at week-
ends is not matched by higher A&E attendances or
admissions, indicating that patients are not simply
being switched between the two routes into hospital
at weekends. The concentration of the weekend effect
where we see a substantial restriction in the patient
flows again raises the possibility that it is due to inad-
equate measurement of how sick they are rather than
lower quality of care at admission.
There may be concern that patients who are directly
admitted could experience different quality of care on
arrival at hospital. A small proportion (6%) of patients
attending A&E are known to have been referred there
by a GP, and they are therefore part of the same patient
pool as direct admissions in that they initially sought
GP care. However, upon arrival at A&E these patients
would be expected to receive the same care as those
who self-refer to A&E. In an attempt to shed further
light on our findings we performed some supplementary
analysis on this group of patients. We found that the
flows of patients referred to A&E by a GP behaved in
much the same way as the direct admissions. The
volume of A&E attenders referred by a GP dropped
by 68% at weekends, as did the volume of admissions
through A&E for this patient group. Attending A&E
on a weekend following GP referral was associated with
a significantly higher risk-adjusted probability of mor-
tality (OR: 1.168; CI: 1.096–1.245). These findings sug-
gest that direct admission to hospital at the weekend is
not a cause of elevated mortality, but instead an indi-
cator of an inherently different patient group. If the
cause of elevated weekend mortality amongst direct
admissions was lower quality of care upon admission

 rather than referral of sicker patients, we would not
expect to see a weekend effect amongst patients referred
to A&E by a GP.
Strengths and limitations
This study used data covering the complete population
of patients attending consultant-led A&E departments
and all emergency admissions to non-specialist acute
hospitals in England over a 11-month period. Our
risk adjustment models for mortality had high explana-
tory power (C-statistics equal to 0.92), but in common
with previous studies we could not take severity of the
primary diagnosis into account, thus limiting our abil-
ity to risk adjust.27 We also did not have information
on out-of-hospital deaths and therefore could only
include deaths that occurred in any hospital within 30
days of admission. This would generate bias if the pro-
portion of all deaths that occur in a hospital is different
for weekend admission.
For an earlier year (1 April 2010 to 31 March 2011), we
do have data on out-of-hospital deaths and these show
that a slightly higher proportion of all deaths within 30
days of admission occurred in a hospital for weekend
admissions (81.3% vs. 80.1%). Our ability to only include
in-hospital deaths in the more recent data is therefore
likely to have a larger effect in reducing the weekday
death rate than the reduction in the weekend death rate.
If the weekend and weekday death rates were the same,
we would find weekend death rates that were 1.5% higher
(81.3%/80.1%) using only in-hospital deaths. Our ana-
lysis is therefore likely to contain a small bias towards
finding higher death rates at the weekend.
Comparison with previous studies
Previous
studies
have
compared
mortality
risk,
adjusted for patient characteristics, between those
admitted to hospital during the week and their coun-
terparts admitted on weekends.1,2,4,6,9 These studies
have consistently found higher mortality rates for
patients admitted at weekends, both before and after
risk adjustment. Whilst we have also found higher mor-
tality rates amongst patients admitted at weekends, our
study differs in two important respects. First, we
widened our focus to include all patients attending
A&E departments, including those not admitted, in
order to avoid possible selection effects in the admitted
population. Second, we assessed direct admissions and
admissions via A&E separately, in order to gain a
better understanding of variations in patient flows
throughout the week. Using this approach we found
there were fewer patients admitted to hospital in an
emergency on weekends, attributable to a 61% lower
volume of direct admission and a 5% lower risk-
adjusted probability of admission following an A&E
attendance. These increased thresholds for admission
at weekends are likely to have biased previous studies
on weekend mortality.
Policy implications
Current initiatives to move towards seven day hospital
services are only likely to be successful in reducing mor-
tality if reduced availability of services in hospitals on
the day of admission is the major cause of the weekend
effect. Our findings cast significant doubt over whether
this is the case. Patients who attend A&E on weekends
are at no higher mortality risk than patients who attend
A&E on weekdays. However, a smaller proportion of
attending patients are admitted at the weekend and this
higher threshold for admission is likely to mean that
patients who are admitted via A&E at the weekend are,
on average, sicker than patients admitted during the
week. Reduced availability of primary care services at
weekends means that fewer patients are admitted to
hospital via this route and these patients are also
likely to be sicker than their counterparts admitted
during the week.
Our results add to the increasing body of evidence
questioning the use of standardized mortality rates as
an indicator of the quality of care in hospitals.28–30 The
weekend effect identified in previous studies may be a
statistical artefact driven by the selection bias intro-
duced by restricting the focus to the admitted popula-
tion.
Extending
services
in
hospitals
and
in
the
community at weekends may increase the number of
emergency admissions, particularly for patients with
less severe illness, and this could have the desired
effect of achieving lower hospital mortality rates.
However, this would be a statistical phenomenon
rather than a clinically meaningful improvement as it
would be achieved by admitting less sick patients rather
than by reducing the absolute number of deaths.
