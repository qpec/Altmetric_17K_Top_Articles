Objective.—To compare the methods and baseline characteristics of the American Migraine Prevalence and Preven-
tion (AMPP) and Chronic Migraine Epidemiology and Outcomes (CaMEO) studies.
Background.—The AMPP and CaMEO studies are the largest longitudinal efforts designed to improve our under-
standing of episodic and chronic migraine in the United States. The studies have complementary strengths and weaknesses.
Methods.—This analysis compares and contrasts the study methods and participation rates of the AMPP and CaMEO
studies. We then compare and contrast baseline results in terms of demographic characteristics, headache features, and dis-
ability as measured by the Migraine Disability Assessment Scale (MIDAS) among people with episodic and chronic migraine.
Results.—AMPP and CaMEO sampled from panels constructed to be representative of the US population. The
AMPP Study collected data using a mailed questionnaire while CaMEO relied on a web survey methodology. Response
rates were higher in AMPP (64.8%) than in CaMEO (16.5%). Both studies assessed headache features using the American
Migraine Study/AMPP diagnostic module. Both identified persons with episodic (<15 headache days/month) and chronic
migraine (�15 headache days/month) based on the International Classification of Headache Disorders. AMPP collected
data annually over 5 years, while CaMEO collected data quarterly over 15 months. Baseline demographic distribution was
generally similar, indicating that each study was broadly representative of the US population. The proportion of persons
with migraine who had chronic migraine was similar (AMPP, 6.6%; CaMEO, 8.8%). Respondents had similar median
headache frequency (days/month) by sex for chronic migraine (AMPP: men 5 21.7, women 5 20.0; CaMEO: men 5 20.0,
women 5 20.0) and episodic migraine (AMPP: men 5 1.7, women 5 2.0; CaMEO: men 5 2.0, women 5 3.0). Median
MIDAS scores were substantially higher in both studies for chronic migraine (severe disability [Grade IV]; AMPP:
men 5 33.0, women 5 45.0; CaMEO: men 5 32.0, women 5 38.0) than episodic migraine (little/mild disability [Grade I/II];
AMPP: men 5 3.0, women 5 6.0; CaMEO: men 5 4.0, women 5 7.0). Rates of moderate/severe disability (Grade III/IV)
were substantially higher in both studies for chronic migraine (AMPP: men 5 66.9%, women 5 78.9%; CaMEO:

women 5 37.9%). More women than men respondents in both studies experienced moderate/severe disability.
Conclusions.—AMPP and CaMEO are longitudinal cohort studies that used different methods, but yielded similar
results for demographic features, headache frequency, and headache-related disability. Both studies found more severe
headache-related disability in those with chronic versus episodic migraine.

Many people with migraine do not consult clini-
cians or receive treatment with prescription drugs,
and among those who do seek care, <15% consult
neurologists or headache specialists.1,2 As a conse-
quence, clinic-based studies that rely on clinician
diagnosis miss a substantial proportion of people
with migraine and identify a sample with more
severe disease and better access to medical care.2
Therefore,
studies
that
systematically
ascertain
disease-state status in more representative non-clinic
samples are essential for increasing awareness and
understanding of health conditions, such as migraine.
Insights gained from these studies can document
healthcare utilization and unmet diagnosis and treat-
ment needs. Ultimately, these studies provide essen-
tial evidence for interventions designed to improve
patient care and clinical outcomes.3-11
The American Migraine Prevalence and Preven-
tion (AMPP) Study,12 conducted from 2004 to 2009,
provided benchmark data for describing migraine
prevalence,
sociodemographic
profiles,
burden,
comorbidity patterns, and prognosis. The AMPP
Study also reported health-related outcomes from
the perspective of the person with migraine. The
more recent Chronic Migraine Epidemiology and
Outcomes (CaMEO) Study,13 conducted from 2012
to 2013, expanded upon findings from the AMPP
Study by providing a larger sample of persons with
chronic
migraine
(CM),
sampling

quency and disability every 3 months instead of
annually, assessing impact of migraine on families
from the perspective of different family members,
and evaluating barriers to medical care for persons
with migraine. Finally, the CaMEO Study sought to

 describe the relationship of migraine with underlying
endophenotypes defined based on an expanded set
of comorbidities and symptom profiles.
Differences in study methods, response rates,
and sample sizes may raise questions about the rep-
resentativeness of the CaMEO Study findings in
comparison with findings from the more widely
published AMPP Study. Because the AMPP Study
had a much higher response rate (64.8% to the
brief initial survey and 77.1% to the subsequent
baseline longitudinal survey) and a large sample
(162,576 respondents to the initial survey), data are
more verifiably representative of the US migraine
population. CaMEO had a lower response rate
(16.5%), raising concerns about potential bias. We
conducted this analysis to compare and contrast
methodology and sample characteristics (sociodemo-
graphic,
features,
headache-day
frequency,
headache-related
disability)
in
the
AMPP
and
CaMEO studies. These results provide a context to
better understand the results of the CaMEO Study.
METHODS
Study Design.—Details of the methods used by
the AMPP and CaMEO studies have been pub-
lished previously12-14 and are contrasted in Table 1.
Briefly, the AMPP Study was based on the methods
used in the American Migraine Study (AMS) and
consisted of 2 phases; phase 1 began in 2004 and
identified individuals with self-reported severe head-
ache
in
a

 households selected to be representative of the US
population. Phase 2 began in 2005 and used mail sur-
veys to determine headache features, treatment pat-
terns, and comorbidities. The CaMEO Study was a
web-based study that used quota sampling to recruit
a demographically representative sample of individu-
als in the United States. Cross-sectional and longitu-
dinal CaMEO Study modules were administered
from September 2012 to November 2013. Both stud-
ies were approved by the institutional review board
of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine.
Study Population.—The AMPP Study initially
included adults and adolescents (age �12 years)
with migraine and other headache types, and the
CaMEO Study included only adults (age �18 years)
with migraine. The present analysis includes only
participants from both studies 18 years of age or
older with migraine. We restricted the age of
AMPP participants based on the age range in
CaMEO. Both studies used the AMS/AMPP diag-
nostic
module
to
assess
the
features
of
migraine.15,16 The diagnostic criteria were a modifi-
cation of the International Classification of Head-
ache Disorders (ICHD) migraine criteria (ICHD-2
for the AMPP Study, ICHD-3b for the CaMEO
Study).17 Two criteria were not confirmed: �5 life-
time migraine events (criterion A) and duration of
attack untreated from 4 to 72 hours (criterion B).
In addition, alternative causes of headache were
not excluded. CM classification was derived from
Silberstein-Lipton criteria18,19 and ICHD-3b criteria
for CM. Respondents with CM were defined as
those with �15 headache days per month averaged
over the past 3 months but did not include assess-
ment of ICHD-3b CM criterion C (ie, �8 days per
month fulfilled migraine criteria). This criterion was
excluded because it is difficult to evaluate in a
large,
self-report
data-collection
paradigm
and
requires the use of a diary and physician interview
to accurately diagnose. Although all CaMEO par-
ticipants met diagnostic criteria for migraine, the
AMPP Study also enrolled those with other severe
headache.
For
comparability
with
the
CaMEO
Study, the AMPP Study data set was limited to
migraine cases in this analysis.
Statistical
Methods.—Baseline
data
from
the
AMPP (2005) and CaMEO (2012) studies were
used in this analysis.13,14 Between-study compara-
tive analyses captured the sociodemographic fea-
tures of age, sex, income, and race. Comparison
data were also generated for headache-related dis-
ability and headache-day frequency.
Headache-related disability was assessed using
the Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) ques-
tionnaire, which categorized missed days of work,
household chores, nonwork activity, and days with
substantially reduced productivity (ie, >50% reduc-
tion in productivity) in the same domains over a 3-
month period.13,14 Scores were classified by severity
as Grade I (little/no disability; score 0–5), Grade II
(mild disability; score 6–10), Grade III (moderate
disability; score 11–20), or Grade IV (severe disabil-
ity; score �21).20 MIDAS Grades III and IV were
netted together and summarized for the purpose of
this analysis. Headache-day frequency was deter-
mined in both studies by asking respondents, “On
how many days in the past 3 months (previous 90
days) did you have a headache?”13,14 This number
was
then
divided
by
3
to
estimate
monthly
headache-day frequency.
Because MIDAS and headache-day frequency
are not normally distributed, median scores are pre-
sented as the measure of central tendency and
interquartile range as the measure of dispersion for
all comparisons. For this analysis, respondents from
both studies were divided into episodic migraine
(EM) and CM groups and further stratified by sex
and age (18–29, 30–39, 40–49, 50–59, and �60
years). Descriptive statistics were generated to com-
pare samples on key target measures. Statistical
testing was not conducted because most of the
between-group
comparisons
involved
very
large
samples. Large sample sizes increase the likelihood
that statistical significance will be attributed to dif-
ferences too small to be of clinical relevance.21 All
descriptive statistics were generated with SPSS Sta-
tistics, version 22.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA).

Headache
1283
 studies included the sampling unit (households vs
individuals), method of data collection (mailed
questionnaire vs web survey), and study duration
(annually over 5 years vs quarterly over 15 months;
Table 1). Of the 120,000 households (representing
257,339 individuals) receiving the AMPP screening
survey in 2004, 77,879 households (64.9% response
rate) provided data, representing a total of 162,765
individuals aged �12 years.22 Analysis of screening

data
identified
28,261
individuals
who
reported �1 severe headache in the past year. In
2005 (the baseline longitudinal year of phase 2 fol-
low-up), a longer postal survey was sent to 24,000
adults aged �18 years, 18,500 of whom returned
valid surveys (77.1% response rate). Of these, 794
(6.6%) met criteria for CM and 11,249 (93.4%) met
criteria for EM, for a total baseline sample of 12,043
respondents
with
migraine
(Table
1).
For
the
CaMEO Study, 489,537 individuals were invited to
participate
in
the
study,
and
80,783
(16.5%)
responded with demographic and headache-related
screening information. Of the respondents, 58,418
provided complete and valid surveys, 16,789 of
whom met diagnostic criteria for migraine (CM, n 5
1,476 [8.8%]; EM, n 5 15,313 [91.2%]; Table 1).
Demographics.—Demographic
distributions
for
age, sex, income, and race were generally similar
between studies, indicating a broad US population
representation for CM and EM (Table 2). In com-
parison with the AMPP Study, the CaMEO Study
had a higher proportion of young respondents
(aged 18–29 years) and more people with higher
incomes (�$50,000) for both CM and EM groups.
Sample sizes were adequate to fairly represent all
sex and age subgroups, except for the low number
of men with CM from the AMPP Study (n 5 163).

 Stratifying by age reduced the subset of men with
CM from the AMPP Study to only 17 respondents
in the 18- to 29-year age group. Despite the small
sample size, results for this segment were consistent
between studies for all age subset comparisons.
Headache-Related Disability.—Median
MIDAS
score was substantially higher in both studies among
those with CM (AMPP: men, score 5 33; women,
score 5 45; CaMEO: men, score 5 32; women,
score 5 38) than among those with EM (AMPP:
men, score 5 3; women, score 5 6; CaMEO: men,
score 5 4; women, score 5 7; Table 2). In both stud-
ies, women experienced greater disability than men
for CM and EM.
Rates of moderate to severe migraine-related
disability (MIDAS Grades III/IV) were similar for
the AMPP and CaMEO studies (Fig. 1). The per-
centage of respondents with Grade III/IV disability
was higher in both studies for women compared
with men for both CM and EM. In addition, rates of
Grade III/IV disability were markedly higher in peo-
ple with CM than EM, regardless of sex. The pro-
portion of the CM and EM groups with Grade III/
IV disability was higher in the CaMEO Study than
in the AMPP Study, though differences were small.
Headache-Day
Frequency.—Median
headache-
day frequencies over the past month for respond-
ents with CM and EM were similar in the AMPP
and CaMEO studies (Fig. 2). Median headache-day
frequencies were higher for respondents with CM
than for those with EM, regardless of sex. Median
headache-day frequencies for respondents with EM
ranged from 1.7 (men in the AMPP Study) to 3.0
(women in the CaMEO Study) headaches in the
past month and were similar between studies.
DISCUSSION
The AMPP and CaMEO studies were longitudi-
nal studies that included a broad base of respond-
ents
with
migraine,
representative
of
the
US
population. Comparison of baseline demographic
data demonstrated similar age, sex, income, and race
distributions
among
EM
and
CM
subsamples
between studies, with the exception of slightly higher
incomes and a somewhat younger population in the
CaMEO Study than in the AMPP Study. The over-
all distribution of headache-related disability and
headache-day frequency was also similar between
AMPP and CaMEO study respondents. Both studies
demonstrated that migraine-related disability was
more severe in women than men and for those with
CM than those with EM. Neither study showed sex
differences in headache-day frequency within the
CM or EM cohorts. Of note, one sex- and age-

 stratified CM subgroup from the AMPP Study (men
aged 18–29 years) was small (n 5 17) but resembled
the CaMEO Study; however, because of the small
sample size, these results should be interpreted with
caution.
The most noteworthy methodological differen-
ces between the AMPP and CaMEO studies were
methods of data collection, sampling strategy, and
survey response rates. This analysis limited the age
range of the AMPP Study sample (“severe head-
ache,” age �12 years) to that used in the CaMEO
Study (“migraine,” age �18 years). The differences
in survey response rates (77.1% for the AMPP
Study vs 16.5% for the CaMEO Study) are note-
worthy because survey nonrespondents may differ
from respondents in important ways, leading to
biased study results.23 To assess potential response
bias in CaMEO, a follow-up survey was sent to a
random sample of CaMEO Study nonrespondents.
A total of 88,451 individuals were sent study invita-
tions and usable data were obtained from 8,225
(9.3% response rate). As expected for comparisons
of large samples, some significant differences were
observed in sample demographics between CaMEO
respondents and nonrespondents, but the overall
pattern of results and the positive case rates for
migraine were comparable. However, the participa-
tion rate in the nonrespondent survey (9.3% of
those invited) was too low to rule out response
bias.13
The differences in baseline income and age dis-
tributions between AMPP and CaMEO studies
may reflect differences in survey design because the
CaMEO Study relied on internet access, a method-
ology more widely used in younger individuals and
persons of higher socioeconomic status.24,25 Persons
with CM might have been underrepresented in the
CaMEO Study, as CM occurs with higher preva-
lence in older, lower income, and lower education
subgroups.26 Additionally, lack of keyboard and
internet literacy27 may limit web-based study partic-
ipation for some people, including the elderly or
those with learning or physical disabilities. How-
ever, among people with migraine, the relative fre-
quency of CM was higher in the CaMEO Study
(8.8%) than in the AMPP Study (6.6%), mitigating
this cause. In addition, internet access continues to
increase, especially among older people, minorities,
and individuals with lower incomes or levels of edu-
cational
achievement.25
Despite
potential
draw-
backs of internet-based surveys, study designs are
evolving, and use of web-based surveys is expand-
ing to include smartphones linked to the Internet.
Smartphone use in the United States is widespread
and growing,28 and smartphone applications and
text
messaging
are
emerging

 conducting research29,30 and may represent the next
generation of epidemiologic surveys.
Both studies had some similar limitations. As is
common in epidemiologic studies, all data were
self-reported, and were not verified by healthcare
professionals or medical records. The AMPP Study
included fewer males and young people, and the
CaMEO Study had a low response rate, making the
sample populations somewhat different.
These findings also compare favorably with pub-
lished data from the cross-sectional International
Burden of Migraine Study (IBMS), a web-based sur-
vey that collected data from 8,726 people with
migraine in 9 countries.31 In IBMS, the proportion
of participants with CM was 5.7% and EM was
94.3%; demographic characteristics were also con-
sistent with the AMPP and CaMEO studies, with
the majority of respondents being female (CM,
85.6%; EM, 83.4%) and white (CM, 89.4%; EM,
85.9%). In addition, respondents with CM reported
greater disability (mean MIDAS score: CM 5 72.6,
EM 5 14.5) and higher rates of moderate/severe dis-
ability (MIDAS grade III/IV: CM 5 89.6%, EM 5
47.4%) than those with EM. Differences in the study
populations may account for some of the variability
in the results between IBMS and the AMPP and
CaMEO studies, since both AMPP and CaMEO
were US-based and only 13.8% of the IBMS popula-
tion was from the United States.
In sum, the CaMEO Study was conducted to
complement and extend previous findings from the
AMPP Study. Despite different survey methods
and response rates, the overall consistency of find-
ings between studies demonstrates that CaMEO
Study respondents are as representative of people
with migraine in the United States as AMPP
respondents. The implications of these findings are
important. The CaMEO Study has generated a
wealth of data on persons with migraine that can
be used to gain a better understanding of the bur-
den
of
illness,
naturally
occurring
comorbidity
endophenotypes, and barriers to achieving adequate
medical care for people with migraine, especially
CM.
CaMEO
data
have
contributed
important
information regarding familial burden of migraine
from the perspectives of the person with migraine,
their partner, and child(ren), providing a more
complete picture of migraine’s impact on the family
than
any
previous
study.32,33
In
addition,
the
CaMEO Study provides novel information regard-
ing naturally occurring
comorbidity
endopheno-
types among people with migraine, including the
contribution of noncephalic pain to new-onset or
persistent
CM.34
Although
the
AMPP
Study
explored barriers to adequate care for people with
EM,35 the CaMEO Study is the first to analyze and
report on these barriers for those with CM.2 Ulti-
mately, the increased understanding of migraine
garnered by CaMEO Study findings will help better
identify individuals in need of care and inform
improved disease management decisions for those
who need it most.
CONCLUSIONS
The AMPP and CaMEO studies were longitu-
dinal cohort studies of people with migraine that
used different methods but yielded similar results
for the distribution of demographic characteristics,
headache-related disability, and headache-day fre-
quency. Comparability of outcomes between the
AMPP and CaMEO studies implies that data gen-
erated from the CaMEO Study are generalizable to
the US migraine population. Future analyses will
compare studies for differences in headache con-
sulting, diagnosis, and treatment patterns.
