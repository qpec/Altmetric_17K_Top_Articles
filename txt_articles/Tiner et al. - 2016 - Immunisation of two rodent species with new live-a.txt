plague

We showed recently that the live-attenuated Δlpp ΔmsbB Δail and Δlpp ΔmsbB::ailL2 mutants of Yersinia pestis CO92 provided short-
term protection to mice against developing subsequent lethal pneumonic plague. These mutants were either deleted for genes
encoding Braun lipoprotein (Lpp), an acetyltransferase (MsbB) and the attachment invasion locus (Ail) (Δlpp ΔmsbB Δail) or
contained a modified version of the ail gene with diminished virulence (Δlpp ΔmsbB::ailL2). Here, long-term immune responses
were first examined after intramuscular immunisation of mice with the above-mentioned mutants, as well as the newly constructed
Δlpp ΔmsbB Δpla mutant, deleted for the plasminogen-activator protease (pla) gene instead of ail. Y. pestis-specific IgG levels
peaked between day 35 and 56 in the mutant-immunised mice and were sustained until the last tested day 112. Splenic memory B
cells peaked earlier (day 42) before declining in the Δlpp ΔmsbB::ailL2 mutant-immunised mice while being sustained for 63 days in
the Δlpp ΔmsbB Δail and Δlpp ΔmsbB Δpla mutant-immunised mice. Splenic CD4+ T cells increased in all immunised mice by day 42
with differential cytokine production among the immunised groups. On day 120, immunised mice were exposed intranasally to
wild-type (WT) CO92, and 80–100% survived pneumonic challenge. Mice immunised with the above-mentioned three mutants had
increased innate as well as CD4+ responses immediately after WT CO92 exposure, and coupled with sustained antibody production,
indicated the role of both arms of the immune response in protection. Likewise, rats vaccinated with either Δlpp ΔmsbB Δail or the
Δlpp ΔmsbB Δpla mutant also developed long-term humoral and cell-mediated immune responses to provide 100% protection
against developing pneumonic plague. On the basis of the attenuated phenotype, the Δlpp ΔmsbB Δail mutant was recently
excluded from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention select agent list.

INTRODUCTION
There has been a rise in the number of human plague cases
globally resulting in the categorisation of Yersinia pestis, the
aetiological agent of the highly fatal pneumonic plague, as a re-
emerging pathogen by the World Health Organization.1 The
progression of pneumonic plague is very rapid after first
appearance of the symptoms in humans, and the case fatality
rate approaches 100%, if the antimicrobial treatment is delayed.2–4
Unfortunately, antibiotic-resistant Y. pestis strains have been
isolated
from
plague
patients
and/or
engineered
for
bioweaponization,4 which is concerning as Y. pestis is classified
by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as a Tier-
1 select agent.4 The optimal strategy for protection against this
deadly disease would be through vaccination; however, there are
currently no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-licensed plague
vaccines available in the United States.5–7
Live-attenuated vaccines promote both humoral- and cell-
mediated immune responses making them the optimal option
to protect humans against pneumonic plague.5,8 The various live-
attenuated Y. pestis EV76 vaccine strains, which lack the pigmenta-
tion locus (pgm) required for iron acquisition, have been used in
plague endemic parts of the world due to vaccine strains’ ability to
provide protection against both bubonic and pneumonic plague.5
Unfortunately, these EV76-based vaccines are not FDA approved
because of high reactogenicity and these strains are not genetically
uniform.9 In addition, Δpgm mutants of Y. pestis cause fatal infection
in individuals with diseases such as hemochromatosis.10,11
Subunit plague vaccines, mainly composed of two immuno-
gens, namely F1 capsular antigen and a type III secretion system
component and effector low calcium response V antigen (LcrV),
are generally protective across various animal species5,8,12–18 but
such vaccines largely generate a humoral immune response.
Furthermore, F1-LcrV-based vaccines would not be ideal against
infection with Y. pestis strains devoid of capsule or those
harbouring
variants
of
LcrV
with
diverged
amino
acid
sequences.19–22
Therefore, our recent efforts to develop novel live-attenuated
vaccines led to the deletion and/or modification of the genes

 encoding Braun lipoprotein (Lpp), an acetyltransferase (MsbB), the
attachment invasion locus (Ail) and the plasminogen-activator
protease (Pla).23–26 Lpp activates toll-like receptor (TLR)-2 leading
to pro-inflammatory cytokine production and septic shock.27–30
MsbB modifies lipopolysaccharide (LPS) resulting in its increased
biological potency.26,31–35 Ail is an outer membrane protein with
extracellular loop 2 (L2) reported to be responsible for Ail-
mediated bacterial serum resistance and adherence/invasion to
the host cells.25,36–43 Pla facilitates bacterial dissemination during
bubonic and pneumonic plague as well as contributes to
intracellular survival of Y. pestis in macrophages.24,44
Recently,
our
laboratory
generated
three
live-attenuated
mutant strains of Y. pestis CO92. The Δlpp ΔmsbB Δail triple
mutant was shown to be safe and highly immunogenic.23,25
However, as Ail also has immunogenic potential,45 the corre-
sponding virulence-associated amino acid residues in L2 of the ail
gene were mutated generating the Δlpp ΔmsbB::ailL2 mutant of
CO92.25 Immunisation of mice with two doses of either Δlpp
ΔmsbB Δail or the Δlpp ΔmsbB::ailL2 mutant via the intramuscular
(i.m.) route triggered robust humoral and cellular immune
responses. Such vaccinated mice were 100% protected when
challenged 21 days after the second immunisation with high
pneumonic challenge doses (70–92 LD50) of wild-type (WT) CO92,
indicating these vaccines were capable of providing short-term
protection.25 We also developed a Δlpp Δpla double mutant of
CO92, and mice immunised with this double mutant developed
protective immunity against subsequent pneumonic challenge.24
Studies have shown that deletion of the msbB gene from Y. pestis
EV76 strain modulated major immunoreactive antigens,46 and that
the Δlpp ΔmsbB double mutant was significantly more attenuated
compared with the single mutants.26 Therefore, we deleted msbB
gene from the Δlpp Δpla double mutant to improve immuno-
genicity and safety of the Δlpp ΔmsbB Δpla triple mutant.
It is imperative that a successful plague vaccine should generate
long-term immunity in immunised animals. Thus, it is essential to
examine if the newly created Δlpp ΔmsbB Δpla mutant as well as
the Δlpp ΔmsbB Δail and Δlpp ΔmsbB::ailL2 mutants have the
ability to elicit protective long-term humoral- and cell-mediated
immune responses, which formed the basis of this study. To
authenticate our data, we used both mouse and rat models of
pneumonic plague.
RESULTS
Attenuation in virulence of the newly generated Δlpp ΔmsbB Δpla
mutant of Y. pestis CO92
To gauge the extent of attenuation, mice (n = 5 per group) were
infected by the intranasal (i.n.) route with 2.5 × 106 colony forming
units (CFU) or 5 × 106 CFU doses of the WT CO92 or the Δlpp
ΔmsbB Δpla mutant (representing 5,000 and 10,000 LD50 of the
WT bacterium).24 Although mice inoculated with the WT CO92
died by day 3 post infection (p.i.), all mice infected with the Δlpp
ΔmsbB Δpla mutant survived with no clinical signs of the disease
such as ruffled fur, hunch back and lethargy (Figure 1). On day 22,
the surviving mice as well as the age-matched naive controls were
exposed i.n. to 1.8 × 104 CFU dose of WT CO92 (36 LD50). All of the
naive mice succumbed to infection by day 27 (5 days p.i.). Animals
receiving the higher immunisation dose of the Δlpp ΔmsbB Δpla
mutant had 80% survival after WT CO92 infection; although
dropping to 70% at the lower vaccination dose (Figure 1).
Evaluation of long-term humoral immunity in mice after
immunisation with live-attenuated mutants of Y. pestis CO92
To further gauge vaccine potential of these three mutants (i.e.
Δlpp ΔmsbB Δail, Δlpp ΔmsbB::ailL2 and Δlpp ΔmsbB Δpla), we used
the optimal vaccination regimen,25 which utilised two i.m. doses
(2.5 × 106 CFU/dose, 21 days apart). A recent study also indicated
that parental immunisation can lead to protective mucosal
immunity, by yet unidentified mechanism(s).47 Using the above-
mentioned vaccination protocol, 100% survivability was noted
with no clinical signs of disease in immunised mice, irrespective of
the mutant used, up to 120 days after the initial immunisation.
To determine long-term humoral immune response generated
by the three live-attenuated vaccine strains, splenocytes were
harvested from mice (n = 3–5 per group per time point) on days
42, 63 and 84 after the first immunisation. The total CD19+ B-cell
population was similar across all groups of mice on all days
examined (~30% of the live cell population) based on flow
cytometry. On day 42, mice immunised with Δlpp ΔmsbB::ailL2,
Δlpp ΔmsbB Δpla or the Δlpp ΔmsbB Δail mutant exhibited
significantly increased CD19+ CD38+ IgG+ memory B-cell popula-
tions (10.5, 7.3 and 4.2%, respectively) in the spleen compared
with animals injected with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (1.6%)
(Figure 2a). By day 63, this population decreased in mice
immunised with the Δlpp ΔmsbB::ailL2 mutant (3.2%), which was
comparable to the population observed in control (PBS) mice
(Figure 2a). In comparison, mice immunised with Δlpp ΔmsbB Δail
or Δlpp ΔmsbB Δpla mutants continued to show increased or
similar population of CD19+ CD38+ IgG+ memory B cells (7.6 and
6.4%, respectively) on day 63. By day 84, these populations
decreased in all of the immunised groups of mice, which were
similar to those in the PBS-injected mice (~0.7–1%) (Figure 2a).
Sera were collected from all mice on days 14, 35, 56, 81 and 112
after the first vaccination for measuring antigen-specific antibody
responses (Figure 2b). On day 14, mice immunised with Δlpp
ΔmsbB Δail or Δlpp ΔmsbB Δpla mutants exhibited increased IgG
antibody titres (Geometric Mean IgG titres of 15,625) against Y.

mice (n = 5 per group) were exposed by the i.n. route with one dose
of 2.5 × 106 CFU or 5 × 106 CFU of the Δlpp ΔmsbB Δpla mutant on
day 0. Mice infected with the 2.5 × 106 CFU of WT CO92 luc2 served
as a control. Surviving mice were then rechallenged i.n. on day 22
with 1.8 × 104 CFU (36 LD50; 1 LD50≅500 CFU) of WT CO92 luc2
strain.24 Age-matched naive mice were used as a rechallenge
control. The P values were calculated using Kaplan–Meier analysis
with log-rank (Mantel–Cox) test and were in comparison to naive
controls.

 the contrary, a boost to the peak IgG antibody titres (46,875) in the
Δlpp ΔmsbB::ailL2 mutant-vaccinated mice was attained by day 56.
These antibody titres remained at similar high levels until day 112
in all of the immunised groups of mice.
A significantly higher IgG1 over IgG2a/b antibody titres were
noted in all of the immunised mice on day 14 (Figure 2c-I). After
the second vaccine dose, and on days 35 and 56, mice immunised
with the Δlpp ΔmsbB Δail and Δlpp ΔmsbB Δpla mutants had

and

responses, whereas mice vaccinated with the Δlpp ΔmsbB::ailL2
mutant
continued

titres
(Figure 2c-II; data not shown for day 56). By day 81, balanced
Th1-based IgG2a and Th2-based IgG1 antibody titres were
observed in mice immunised with the Δlpp ΔmsbB Δail or the
Δlpp ΔmsbB::ailL2 mutant, whereas the Δlpp ΔmsbB Δpla mutant-
vaccinated mice exhibited significantly higher IgG1 titres com-
pared with IgG2a/b titres (Figure 2c-III). By day 112, mice
immunised with the Δlpp ΔmsbB Δail or the Δlpp ΔmsbB::ailL2
mutant maintained balanced Th1-based IgG2a and Th2-based
IgG1
antibody
titres.
However,
Δlpp

mutant-
vaccinated mice possessed significantly higher IgG2a titres
compared with IgG1 antibody titres (Figure 2c-IV).
Overall, all immunised mice maintained high levels of IgG1,

experiment, albeit some skewing of Th1- and Th2-based immune
responses
occurred.

 mutants were metabolically active as no apparent alterations were
observed in the production of both F1 and LcrV compared with
the WT CO92 based on the F1 antigen capture-based dipstick and
Western blot analyses (Figure 3).23,25
Long-term cell-mediated immunity after immunisation of mice
with live-attenuated mutants of Y. pestis CO92
To examine T cell-mediated immune responses after immunisa-
tion, splenocytes were isolated from mice and stained for T cell-
specific markers on days 42, 63 and 84. By day 42, all immunised
mice had statistically significant increased population of CD4+
cells in the spleen (Figure 4a). On day 84, although the increasing
pattern still continued in all three mutant-immunised mice as
compared with mice injected with PBS (20.5%), only mice
vaccinated with the Δlpp ΔmsbB Δail mutant had statistically
significant higher CD4+ population (29.7%). The CD4+ population
was 26.5 and 28.4% in mice immunised with Δlpp ΔmsbB::ailL2 and
Δlpp ΔmsbB Δpla mutants, respectively (Figure 4a).
To
further
evaluate
cell-mediated
immune
responses
in
vaccinated mice, T cells were stained for selected cytokines or
transcription factors. On days 42 and 63, interferon (IFN)-γ+ CD4+
cell population was significantly increased in mice immunised
with the Δlpp ΔmsbB Δail mutant (~2–2.7%) or the Δlpp ΔmsbB
Δpla mutant (~3.1–3.2%) compared with PBS-injected mice
(~0.7–1.7%) (Figure 4b-I). On day 84, although the IFN-γ+ CD4+
cell population remained significantly high in mice immunised
with the Δlpp ΔmsbB Δail mutant (2.7%), this cell population
decreased in Δlpp ΔmsbB Δpla mutant-immunised mice (0.7%)
(Figure 4b-I). The IFN-γ+ CD4+ cell population in mice vaccinated
with the Δlpp ΔmsbB::ailL2 mutant (~1.8%) was comparable to that
of PBS-injected mice (~1.7%) on day 42, increasing significantly on
day 63 (~2.4%). However, it dropped to a level similar to that in
the PBS-injected mice on day 84.
IL-17A+ CD4+ cell population increased in all immunised mice
on day 42 (~0.5–1.3%) compared with PBS-injected mice (0.003%)
(Figure 4b-II); however, only mice immunised with the Δlpp ΔmsbB
Δpla mutant reached statistical significance and had the highest
IL-17A+ CD4+ population compared with all other groups.
Importantly, the level of IL-17A+ CD4+ cells were further elevated
on day 63 in all of the immunised mice (~1.2–1.9%) compared
with that on day 42, and was significant higher than that of the
PBS-injected mice (~0.3%). By day 84, this subset of population in
the immunised mice returned to that of the PBS-injected mice.
Interestingly, Foxp3+ CD4+ cell population increased significantly
in all immunised mice on day 42 (~8.6–9.4%) compared with PBS-
injected mice (6.3%) (Figure 4b-III). On day 63, these levels
remained elevated (~7.2–10.5%) compared with those in naive
mice (~5%). By day 84, this subset of cell population in vaccinated
mice returned to that of PBS-injected mice.
Evaluation of long-term protection against pneumonic plague
provided by immunisation of mice with live-attenuated mutants
of Y. pestis CO92
On day 120, mice were challenged via the i.n. route with 1.2 × 104
CFU dose (24 LD50) of the WT CO92 luc2 strain (with the luciferase
gene) to mimic the pneumonic plague.23–26,48 The PBS-injected
mice succumbed to infection by day 125 (5 days p.i.) (Figure 5a).
Two of these five mice died prior to imaging for bioluminescence.
The image in Figure 5b-I (PBS) showed that two of the three
remaining control mice were positive for bioluminescence on day
123 (3 days p.i.). One animal with the strongest bioluminescence
died immediately after the imaging, whereas the other two with
somewhat weaker or negative bioluminescence died on day 4 and
5 p.i., respectively. The mouse on the extreme right side in the
panel PBS represented an uninfected control for imaging. One
animal from each of the Δlpp ΔmsbB Δail and Δlpp ΔmsbB::ailL2
mutant-immunised groups were positive for bioluminescence, and
Figure 3.
Production of LcrV and F1 by the live-attenuated mutants of Y. pestis CO92. To detect F1 production, 100 μl of each 37 °C grown
bacterial cultures (1 × 107 CFU) was analysed with the F1 antigen capture-based dipstick, and WT CO92 as well as its F1 minus mutant (Δcaf1)
were used as controls (a). To detect LcrV production, bacterial cultures were first grown at 37 °C in the presence of 5 mmol/l EGTA to activate
T3SS. Cell pellets were then subjected to western blot analysis with specific anti-LcrV antibodies, and the antibody to DnaK was employed as a
control for the sample loading (b). The density of LcrV on the immunoblot for each lane was normalised to that of its corresponding DnaK
immunoblot and presented as a bar graph (c).

 the infection was confined to the lungs (Figure 5b-II and III). These
two mice succumbed to infection on day 125 (5 days p.i.),
resulting in 80% animal survival (Figure 5a). The remaining mice in
these groups survived and were negative for bioluminescence on
day 10 after challenge, thus suggesting clearance of WT CO92
before day 10. All of the mice immunised with the Δlpp ΔmsbB
Δpla mutant survived exposure to WT CO92, and they were
negative for bioluminescence on both days 3 and 10 p.i.
(Figures 5a, b-IV).
Evaluation of the immediate innate immune response of
vaccinated mice after exposure to WT Y. pestis CO92 in a
pneumonic plague model
On day 120, both mutant-immunised- and PBS-injected control
mice were exposed to 24 LD50 of WT CO92 luc2 strain. On day 124
(4 days p.i.), spleens were harvested from a subset of the
challenged mice (n = 3–4 per group) to determine innate immune
cell response subsequent to the challenge. The total number of
CD11c+ CD11b− resident dendritic cells (DCs) was maximally
increased in mice immunised with the Δlpp ΔmsbB::ailL2 mutant
(6.3%) compared with the other two groups of vaccinated (with
Δlpp ΔmsbB Δail (4.3%) or Δlpp ΔmsbB Δpla (4.7%) mutant) mice
(Figure 6a). Importantly, the DC numbers significantly increased in
all immunised mice compared with mice that were injected with
PBS and exposed to the WT CO92 luc2 strain (2.5%) (Figure 6a).
The total number of CD80+ CD86+ cells, which represented
activated
CD11c+
CD11b−
DC
populations,
was
maximally
increased in mice immunised with the Δlpp ΔmsbB Δail mutant
followed by the Δlpp ΔmsbB::ailL2 and Δlpp ΔmsbB Δpla mutants
subsequent to the WT CO92 exposure (Figure 6b-I). These
activated DC cell numbers were in comparison to mice injected
with PBS and exposed to WT CO92. Likewise, MHC-II expression
was highest in the CD11c+ CD11b− cell population isolated from
mice vaccinated with the Δlpp ΔmsbB Δail mutant followed by
that of Δlpp ΔmsbB::ailL2 or Δlpp ΔmsbB Δpla mutants when
compared with mice injected with PBS and exposed to WT CO92
(Figure 6b-II).
Evaluation of cytokine producing CD4+ T cells in immunised mice
after exposure to WT Y. pestis CO92 in a pneumonic plague model
Similar to the DC staining above, the isolated splenocytes were
stained for T cell markers to determine immune recall response
after exposure to WT CO92, and an additional time point on day
141 (21 days p.i.) was also included. For the 124-day time point,
spleens from PBS-injected mice with and without exposure to WT
CO92 were used as controls. As all PBS-injected mice, exposed to
WT CO92 succumbed to infection by day 141 (21 days p.i.), we
only used PBS-injected mice not exposed to WT CO92 as controls
for this time point.
On day 124 (4 days p.i.), there were no differences in the total
number of CD4+ cell population in any groups of the immunised
and control mice after challenge with WT CO92 (Figure 7a). By day
141 (21 days p.i.), mice immunised with Δlpp ΔmsbB::ailL2 or Δlpp
ΔmsbB Δpla mutants had increased number of total CD4+

 population (~260–27.5%) compared with Δlpp ΔmsbB Δail mutant-
immunised mice, or those which served as controls (Figure 7a).
Early after exposure to WT CO92 (day 4 p.i.), the spleens of all
immunised mice, for example, with Δlpp ΔmsbB Δail, Δlpp ΔmsbB::
ailL2 or the Δlpp ΔmsbB Δpla mutants possessed increased
percentage of IFN-γ+ CD4+ cells (4.6, 5.2 and 7.4%), respectively.
This was in comparison to mice injected with PBS but not exposed
to WT CO92 (1.6%) as well as to those mice that were injected with
PBS and exposed to WT CO92 (1.7%) (Figure 7b-I). By day 21 p.i.,
the percentage of IFN-γ+ CD4+ cells decreased in all surviving mice
immunised with Δlpp ΔmsbB Δail, Δlpp ΔmsbB::ailL2 or Δlpp ΔmsbB
Δpla mutants (3, 3.2 and 3.4%, respectively) (Figure 7b-I). However,
this cell population was still significantly higher when compared
with the control naive mice without exposure to WT CO92 (1%).
IL-17A+ CD4+ cells were increased in spleens of mice immunised
with the Δlpp ΔmsbB Δail and Δlpp ΔmsbB Δpla mutants compared
with mice vaccinated with the Δlpp ΔmsbB::ailL2 mutant or
injected with PBS after exposure to WT CO92 on day 4 p.i.
(Figure 7b-II). On day 141 (21 days p.i.), the percentage of IL-17A+
CD4+ cells was further increased in spleens of mice immunised
with the Δlpp ΔmsbB Δail mutant, whereas maintained at a similar
level in mice vaccinated with the Δlpp ΔmsbB Δpla mutant
compared with day 4 p.i. On the contrary, a robust increase in the
population of IL-17A+ CD4+ cells was noted in mice vaccinated
with the Δlpp ΔmsbB::ailL2 mutant followed by exposure to WT
CO92 on day 141 (21 days p.i.) (Figure 7b-II).
On day 124 (4 days p.i.), the Foxp3+ CD4+ cell population was
increased in mice vaccinated with Δlpp ΔmsbB Δail, Δlpp ΔmsbB::
ailL2 or the Δlpp ΔmsbB Δpla mutants (7.8, 5.2 and 6.8%,
respectively) when compared with PBS-injected and unexposed
naive control (3.6%) (Figure 7b-III). However, this difference was
only significant for the Δlpp ΔmsbB Δail mutant when compared
with mice that were injected with PBS and exposed to WT CO92.
By day 141 (21 days p.i.), all surviving mice immunised with Δlpp
ΔmsbB Δail, Δlpp ΔmsbB::ailL2 or Δlpp ΔmsbB Δpla mutants had
increased Foxp3+ CD4+ cells (15.5, 14.7 and 12.5%, respectively),
compared with control mice (7.4%) (Figure 7b-III).
Evaluation of humoral and cell-mediated immunity in the mutant-
immunised rats necessary for protection against WT Y. pestis CO92
challenge in a pneumonic plague model
On the basis of the mouse data presented above, both Δlpp
ΔmsbB Δail and Δlpp ΔmsbB Δpla mutants elicited slightly better
humoral and cell-mediated immune responses than that of the
Δlpp ΔmsbB::ailL2 mutant. Therefore, these two mutants were
further evaluated in a rat model of pneumonic plague to
authenticate mouse data.
Similar to the mouse model, inbred Brown Norway rats were
immunised with two i.m. doses (2.5 × 106 CFU/dose, 21 days apart)
of the selected mutants, and rats receiving PBS injection served as
a control. Sera were collected from all rats on days 0, 14, 35, 56, 77
and 88 after the first vaccination for measuring antigen-specific
antibody responses. As shown in Figure 8a, the immunised rats in
both immunisation groups exhibited high IgG antibody titres
(Geometric Mean IgG titres of 9,325) against Y. pestis F1-V fusion
antigen on day 14. More specifically, in rats immunised with the
Δlpp ΔmsbB Δail mutant, the IgG antibody titres remained
plateaued until day 56 with a slight decrease on day 77 and then
maintained at the same level to the last examining day (day 88).

Survival analysis of immunised mice after exposure to WT
Y. pestis CO92 in a pneumonic plague model. Mice (n = 5–6 per

CFU/dose) of Δlpp ΔmsbB Δail, Δlpp ΔmsbB::ailL2 or the Δlpp ΔmsbB
Δpla mutants on days 0 and 21. Mice were injected i.m. with PBS to
serve as controls (n = 5 per group). (a) Mice were exposed i.n. on day
120 with 1.2 × 104 CFU (24 LD50; 1 LD50≅500 CFU)24 of the WT CO92
luc2 strain (with luciferase gene). The P values were calculated using
the Kaplan–Meier analysis with log-rank (Mantel–Cox) test and were
in comparison to the naive control. (b) Bioluminescence imaging of
mice. Surviving mice after i.n. exposure with 1.2 × 104 CFU of WT
CO92 luc2 strain were imaged on days 123 and 130 (days 3 and 10 p.
i.). The mouse at the extreme right side in each panel was
uninfected naive animal to serve as an imaging control. The
bioluminescent scale is within the figures and ranges from most
intense (red) to least intense (violet).

 On the other hand, by day 35, a boost in the IgG antibody titres
(46,875) occurred in rats immunised with the Δlpp ΔmsbB Δpla
mutant and remained high until day 88.
To evaluate CD4+ T cell-mediated immune responses in
vaccinated rats, splenocytes (n = 3 per group) were isolated on
day 42. Although all groups of rat (both immunised and PBS-
injected control) had similar number of total CD4+ cell populations
(~31.4–33.9%), significantly increased IL-17A+ CD4+ cell popula-
tion was observed in both groups of immunised rats (~1.2–2%)
compared with the PBS-injected control rats (0.2%) (Figure 8b).
Furthermore, rats immunised with the Δlpp ΔmsbB Δpla mutant
had
higher
IL-17A+CD4+
population
than
that
of
animals
vaccinated with the Δlpp ΔmsbB Δail mutant (Figure 8b). The
IFN-γ+ CD4+ cell population also increased in both mutant-
immunised rats (~15.5–19.9%) as compared with the PBS-injected
control rats (~8.5%); however, a statistical significance was not
achieved (data not shown).
To further evaluate the vaccine efficacy of the two mutants, the
immunised rats (n = 6 per group) were challenged via the i.n. route
with WT CO92 luc2 strain at the dose of either 2.3 × 104 CFU (46
LD50) on day 43 to evaluate short-term protection or 1.6 × 104 CFU
(31 LD50) on day 91 to evaluate long-term protection. As shown in
Figure 8c,d, all the PBS-injected control rats succumbed to
infection. On the contrary, 100% survival was noted in rats
immunised with either the Δlpp ΔmsbB Δail or the Δlpp ΔmsbB
Δpla mutant. Most importantly, no WT CO92 luc2 strain were
detected in the blood and organs (lungs, liver and spleen) from
both groups of immunised rats 14 days after challenge for the
long-term protection assessment, indicating that the challenged
bacterium was cleared from the immunised rats.
DISCUSSION
It is crucial that a potential vaccine candidate(s) demonstrates
long-term immune responses and protection. This is the first study
to
examine several
components
of
the
immune
response
generated after immunisation of mice and rats with the above
three live-attenuated mutants over a period of 3–4 months.
The kinetics of memory B-cell production in Y. pestis EV76
vaccine strain-immunised mice has been reported.49 Similar to our
protocol, mice were immunised i.m. with two doses (8 × 107 CFU/
dose) of EV76 (21 days apart) and splenocytes harvested
periodically
after
immunisation.49
However,
CD38
and
IgD
expressing CD19+ CD27+ population was evaluated in that
study. CD27 is not considered as an appropriate marker for
memory B cells in mice,50,51 and the lack of CD27 expression on
memory B cells has been previously reported.52 CD38 has been
widely accepted as a marker of memory B cells as antigen-specific
IgG1 B cells with high CD38 expression and similar characteristics
to recirculating memory B cells are apparent weeks after
immunisation.50,53 Although IgD and IgG are produced by
activated B cells, we designated memory B-cell population as
CD38 and IgG producing CD19+ cells. By day 7, memory B-cell
populations increased in EV76-immunised mice in the spleen.49
However, this population of cells sharply decreased by day 56.49
Memory B cells in the Δlpp ΔmsbB::ailL2 mutant-immunised mice
behaved similar to those in the EV76-immunised animals with
increases in the CD19+ CD38+ IgG+ cell population on day 42
which decreased to the levels seen in naive mice by day 63
(Figure 2a). However, memory B-cell population in Δlpp ΔmsbB
Δail and Δlpp ΔmsbB Δpla mutant-immunised mice increased or
remained high through day 63 and declined to levels seen in
naive mice only on day 84 (Figure 2a).
In terms of antibody production, total IgG titres in the Δlpp
ΔmsbB::ailL2 mutant-immunised mice reached a maximal level on
day 56 and then plateaued, whereas mice immunised with the
other two mutants, Δlpp ΔmsbB Δail and Δlpp ΔmsbB Δpla,
showed maximum IgG titres by day 35 and then plateaued
(Figure 2b). In contrast, the total memory B-cell population peaked
at day 42 in the Δlpp ΔmsbB::ailL2 mutant-immunised mice, which
then decreased to levels of PBS-injected, naive mice by day 63
(Figure 2a). Interestingly, mice immunised with the other two
mutants were capable of sustaining memory B-cell populations
until day 63 (Figure 2a). These differences in time to peak antibody
titres versus the maximum percentage of memory B-cell popula-
tion in the Δlpp ΔmsbB::ailL2 mutant-immunised mice (Figure 2a,b)
could be attributed to low avidity of the IgG antibodies to F1-V
antigens of Y. pestis early during vaccination before switching to
high-affinity antibodies later during immunisation. Alternatively,
these memory B cells from Δlpp ΔmsbB::ailL2 mutant-immunised
mice might be secreting less IgG per cell compared with that of
the memory B cells of Δlpp ΔmsbB Δail- and Δlpp ΔmsbB Δpla
mutant-immunised
mice
because
of
a
high
proportion
of
unswitched memory B cells early during immunisation.54

days 0 and 21. Mice i.m. injected with PBS served as controls. On day 120, all mice were exposed i.n. to 1.2 × 104 CFU (24 LD50; 1 LD50≅500
CFU)24 of the WT CO92 luc2 strain. Spleens were harvested from mice (n = 3–4 per group) on day 124 (days 4 p.i.). Splenocytes were stained
and analysed by Flow cytometry. (a) Total per cent of CD11c+ CD11b− (resident DC markers) expressing cells was calculated using FlowJo. (b)
Per cent of CD80+ CD86+ (I; activation markers) and MHC-II+ (II) expressing DCs were also calculated. Two-way ANOVA analysis with Tukey post
hoc was utilised for determining statistical significance. *Po0.05, **Po0.01, ***Po0.001 and ****Po0.0001 as compared with PBS-injected

 Mice immunised i.m. with two doses (8 × 107 CFU/dose) of EV76
strain (21 days apart) had lower total F1-specific IgG titres (10,000–
15,000 on day 42).55 These titres decreased below 10,000 by day
70, and further declined before attaining a steady state level
(1,400) by day 322.55 In comparison, mice vaccinated with our live-
attenuated mutants at a lower dose (2 × 106 CFU/dose) were not
only able to achieve total F1-V specific IgG titres of 46,875 by day
35–56 but were able to maintain these maximum titres until day
112 (Figure 2b).
Overall, all three live-attenuated mutants stimulated long-
lasting T cell-mediated immune responses capable of protecting
mice from developing subsequent pneumonic plague. Our data
generally indicated an increase in IFN-γ-, IL-17A- and Foxp3-
expressing CD4+ T cells after immunisation (Figure 4). A similar
trend was also noted when these mutant-immunised mice were
subsequently exposed to WT CO92 in a pneumonic model
(Figure 7). All immunised mice that survived WT CO92 luc2 strain
challenge rapidly cleared the bacteria (3 days p.i.) as measured by
bioluminescence (Figure 5b), possibly due to increased production
of IFN-γ by CD4+ cells (Figure 7b-I). IFN-γ promotes macrophage
activation facilitating defence against bacterial pathogens,56 and it
has been shown that IFN-γ as well as tumour necrosis factor-α are
important
co-determinants
of
antibody-mediated
protection
against pneumonic plague.57 Consequently, the increased pre-
sence of IFN-γ+ CD4+ cells in conjunction with F1-V specific
neutralising antibody production could augment opsonization
and clearance of Y. pestis.
Th17 cells are potent secretors of IL-17A, and it has recently
been shown that IL-17A provides an antibody-independent
heterologous protection of the host against many pathogenic
bacterial infections, including Y. pestis.58,59 For example, IL-17A
was induced by the intranasal immunisation of mice with the
Y. pestis strain D27-pLpxL KIM/D27 engineered to produce
Escherichia coli LpxL, which increases TLR-4 activation by LPS of
Y. pestis.60 Thus, IL-17A contributed significantly to T cell-mediated
defence against pulmonary Y. pestis infection.59 Consistent with
previous reports,58,59 we also showed Δlpp ΔmsbB Δpla mutant-
immunised mice had the highest increase in IL-17A producing
CD4+ cells immediately after WT CO92 exposure (Figure 7b-II)
resulting
in
efficient
clearance
of
the
invading
pathogen.
Importantly, the IL-17A+ CD4+ cell population decreased in the
Δlpp ΔmsbB Δpla mutant-immunised mice 21 days post WT CO92
exposure (Figure 7b-II) signifying a possible faster resolution of
inflammation, which is desirable in a potential vaccine.
In contrast, mice vaccinated with Δlpp ΔmsbB Δail or Δlpp
ΔmsbB::ailL2 mutants and subsequently challenged with WT CO92
had increased IL-17A producing CD4+ cells 21 days p.i. (Figure 7b-II).
Thus, these mice would most likely had somewhat of a prolonged
Figure 7.

(2 × 106 CFU/dose) of Δlpp ΔmsbB Δail, Δlpp ΔmsbB::ailL2 or the Δlpp
ΔmsbB Δpla mutants on days 0 and 21. Mice were exposed i.n. on
day 120 with 1.2 × 104 CFU (24 LD50; 1 LD50≅500 CFU)24 of the WT

exposed or not exposed to WT CO92 luc2 served as controls. Spleens

IFN-γ (I; Th1 marker), IL-17A (II; Th17 marker) and Foxp3 (III; Treg
marker) expressing CD4+ cells was calculated. Two-way ANOVA

significance. *Po0.05, **Po0.01, ***Po0.001 and ****Po0.0001 as

 inflammatory response after exposure to WT CO92; however, not to
an extent to cause any adverse histopathological lesions in
immunised mice.25 Interestingly, production of IL-17A from T cells
was also observed in our previous study when isolated T cells from
Δlpp ΔmsbB Δail and Δlpp ΔmsbB::ailL2 mutant-immunised mice
were co-cultured with antigen-presenting cells, which had been
exposed to heat-killed WT CO92.25
Foxp3 is a transcription factor and marker for Treg cells (Foxp3+
CD4+), which are primarily responsible for dampening immune
responses. Recent studies have revealed that Treg cells can
promote protective Th17-associated immune responses against
bacterial infections.61,62 Interestingly, both Foxp3+ and IL-17A+
CD4+ cells were concurrently increased both after immunisation as
well as after WT CO92 challenge (Figures 4b and 7b). However, a
direct link between Treg cells and Th17-based protective immune
responses against Y. pestis still needs further investigation.
Consistent
with
the
above-mentioned
data,
all
mutant-
immunised mice had increased DC population expressing MHC-II
(Figure 6b-II), which is required for antigen presentation to CD4+
cells.63 An increasing trend in the activation of DCs was noted for
all mutant-immunised mice, which attained statistical significance
for the Δlpp ΔmsbB Δail mutant. Overall, our results indicated
immunisation of mice with any of these mutants could success-
fully induce activation of an innate immune response after
exposure to WT CO92. Most importantly, all three live-attenuated
mutants stimulated both long-term humoral- and cell-mediated
immune responses, which protected mice against exposure to
highly lethal pneumonic challenge (Figure 5).
In the second animal model of pneumonic plague, both the
Δlpp ΔmsbB Δail and Δlpp ΔmsbB Δpla mutants also stimulated
robust humoral and cell-mediated immune responses, which
provided both short and long-term protection to rats (100%)
against WT CO92 pneumonic challenge (Figure 8). The signifi-
cantly increased IL-17A+ CD4+ population in the immunised rats
further highlighted the importance of IL-17 against Y. pestis
infection.
In addition to efficiency, safety is another important aspect for
vaccine development. Recently, we have shown that both the
Δlpp ΔmsbB Δail and Δlpp ΔmsbB::ailL2 mutants are safe live-
attenuated vaccine candidates due to their quick clearance from
Figure 8.
Immune response and protection in rats conferred by immunisation with mutants of Y. pestis CO92 against pneumonic plague.
Brown Norway rats were immunized by the i.m. route with two doses (2 × 106 CFU/dose) of Δlpp ΔmsbB Δail or the Δlpp ΔmsbB Δpla mutant
on days 0 and 21. Rats were injected i.m. with PBS to serve as controls. (a) Sera were collected from rats on days 0, 14, 35, 56, 77 and 88 after

analysis with log-rank (Mantel–Cox) test and were in comparison to the naive control.

 injection site by 24–48 h after vaccination, and these mice had no
histopathological lesions during immunisation.25 Our extensive
data with the Δlpp ΔmsbB Δail mutant23,25 led to its exclusion from
the CDC select agent list. In this study, we have further
demonstrated that the WT CO92 luc2 challenge strain was
efficiently cleared from the immunised mice and rats after
10–14 days post challenge as examined by using either IVIS or
the plate count method. Our future goals are to obtain permission
from the CDC to exclude Δlpp ΔmsbB::ailL2 and Δlpp ΔmsbB Δpla
mutants from the select agent list, allowing safe production of
these vaccines under biosafety level 2 precautions. We will further
evaluate safety of these live-attenuated vaccine candidates in
immunocompromised mice, study in more depth their immune
protection mechanisms, and to finally examine efficacy of these
vaccines in non-human primates.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Y. pestis and recombinant E. coli strains were grown as described by us
previously.23,24,26 All of our studies were performed in a Tier-1 select agent
facility within the Galveston National Laboratory (GNL), UTMB.
Creation of the Δlpp ΔmsbB Δpla mutant of Y. pestis CO92
The in-frame deletion of the msbB gene from the Δlpp Δpla double mutant
of Y. pestis CO92 was prepared using the suicide vector pDMS197 followed
by homologous recombination as described previously by our laboratory.26
The in-frame deletion of the msbB gene was confirmed by polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) analysis employing specific primers26 as well as by
DNA sequencing of the flanking regions to the msbB gene on the
chromosome.
Production of LcrV and F1 by the live-attenuated mutants of
Y. pestis CO92
WT CO92 and the Δlpp ΔmsbB Δail, Δlpp ΔmsbB::ailL2. and Δlpp ΔmsbB Δpla
mutants were grown overnight in heart infusion broth (HIB) at 28 °C and
then diluted 1:20 in 5 ml HIB supplemented with 5 mM EGTA. Cultures
were incubated at 28 °C for 2 h and then at 37 °C (to activate the T3SS) for
an additional 3 h. The cell pellets were dissolved in SDS–PAGE buffer and
analysed with anti-LcrV antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz,
CA, USA). The anti-DnaK monoclonal antibody (Enzo Life Sciences, Boston,
MA, USA) was employed for analysis and normalisation of protein
concentrations in cell pellets. The density of the immunoblots was
analysed by using Image Studio Lite Version 5.2 (Li-Cor, Lincoln, NE, USA).
To detect F1 production, 100 μl of each 37 °C grown bacterial cultures
(1 × 107 CFU) was analysed with the F1 antigen capture-based dipstick
(Plague BioThreat Alert test strips, Tetracore, Inc., Rockville, MD, USA) as we
previously described.23,25
Animal studies
Six-to-eight-week old, female Swiss-Webster mice were purchased from
Taconic Laboratories (Germantown, NY, USA), and four-to-five-week old
(50–75 g) Brown Norway female rats were purchased from Charles River
(Houston, TX, USA). The animal studies were performed in the Animal
Biosafety Level (ABSL)-3 facility under an approved Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee protocol.
Attenuation.
Mice were infected by the i.n. route with one dose of
2.5 × 106 CFU/40 μl or 5 × 106 CFU/40 μl of the Δlpp ΔmsbB Δpla mutant,
and mice i.n. infected with 2.5 × 106 CFU/40 μl of WT CO92 served as
control.23,24 Animals were assessed for morbidity and/or mortality for
twenty-two days. The surviving mice were then rechallenged by the i.n.
route with 1.8 × 104 CFU/40 μl (36 LD50) of the bioluminescent WT Y. pestis
CO92 luc2 strain.23 The naive mice served as rechallenge controls.
Immunisation.
Mice were immunised by the i.m. route with two doses
(2 × 106 CFU/100 μl) of the Δlpp ΔmsbB Δail, Δlpp ΔmsbB::ailL2 or the Δlpp
ΔmsbB Δpla mutant. One group of mice received PBS in lieu of bacteria,
thus representing a naive, unimmunized control. Two doses of the vaccine
were given in a 50 μl volume in each of the hind legs 21 days apart.25
Animals were assessed for morbidity and/or mortality over the duration of
vaccination.
Antibody production.
Retro-orbital bleeding of all mice occurred on days
0, 14, 35, 56, 81 and 112. Sera were filtered by using Costar 0.1-μm
centrifuge tube filters (Corning Inc., Corning, NY, USA). ELISA plates were
coated with the F1-V fusion protein (1 ng/ml, BEI Resources, Manassas, VA,
USA) overnight at 4 °C.23,24,26 Total IgG and antibody isotypes (IgG1, IgG2a
and IgG2b) against F1-V in the sera (1:5 serially diluted) of all mice were
determined as we previously described.23,25
Organ harvesting.
To evaluate immunogenicity of the mutant strains,
spleens from three control and five immunised mice (per group per time
point) were isolated on days 42, 63 and 84. In addition, another set of mice
(immunised and control, n = 8–10 per group) were first exposed to
1.2 × 104 CFU/40 μl (24 LD50) of the bioluminescent WT Y. pestis CO92 luc2
strain on day 120 after the first immunisation. Spleens were then
isolated from these surviving mice (n = 3–5 per group) on either day 124
(4 days p.i.) or on day 141 (21 days p.i.). The PBS-injected mice without
exposure to WT CO92 luc2 (n = 3) served as an additional control for the T
cell experiment. Single cell suspensions were prepared by forcing the
spleens through nylon cell strainers and by suspending the cells in RPMI
1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were collected by
centrifugation, with blood cells being removed by using red blood cell lysis
buffer (Sigma-Aldrich; St Louis, MO, USA).
Flow cytometry analysis.
All cells were stained with Ghost Dye-APC/Cy7
(Tonbo biosciences; San Diego, CA, USA) to gate for live cell populations.
Splenic cells (1 × 106) were incubated with 0.5 μg/sample anti-mouse
CD16/32 antibody (BioLegend; San Diego, CA, USA) for 10 min on ice to
prevent non-specific binding of monoclonal antibodies to the Fc receptors.
The surface of the B cells was stained with monoclonal anti-mouse CD19-
FITC (B-cell surface marker; BioLegend), anti-mouse CD38-PE/Cy7 (memory
B-cell marker; BioLegend) and anti-mouse IgG-PE (mature, isotype-
switched B-cell marker; Southern Biotech; Birmingham, AL) for 30 min in
the dark at 4 °C.
To measure T cell kinetics, splenic cells were pretreated with ionomycin
(750 ng/ml) and phorbol 12- myristate 13-acetate (PMA, 50 ng per sample),
and then incubated 2 h later with Brefeldin A (0.7 μg per sample) to
accumulate intracellular cytokines. The surface of the T cells was stained
with monoclonal anti-mouse CD4-PE/Dazzle594 (BioLegend) and anti-
mouse CD8-FITC (BioLegend) for 30 min in the dark at 4 °C to distinguish
CD4+ and CD8− expressing cells. Stained cells were centrifuged, washed
and permeabilized with Foxp3 staining buffer set (eBioscience; San Diego,
CA, USA). T cells were stained with anti-mouse IFN-γ-Percp/Cy5.5
(BioLegend),
anti-mouse
IL-17A-PE/Cy7
(BioLegend)
and
anti-mouse
Foxp3-PacificBlue (eBioscience) for 30 min in the dark at 4 °C.
To determine innate immune responses, the surface of DCs was stained
with monoclonal anti-mouse CD11c-PE/Dazzle594 (BioLegend), anti-mouse
CD11b-Percp/Cy5.5 (BioLegend), anti-mouse CD80-Pacific Blue (BioLe-
gend), anti-mouse CD86-FITC (BioLegend) and anti-mouse MHC-II-PE
(Tonbo Biosciences) for 30 min in the dark at 4 °C.
All stained cells were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS, examined
for sterility and then subjected to flow cytometry. Suitable isotype
antibodies for all experiments were used as controls. The differential cell
population was acquired on flow cytometer (LSRII Fortessa) and analysed
using FACS diva software (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA).
Challenge.
On day 120, a set of immunised and PBS-injected control mice
(n = 5 per group) were exposed by the i.n. route with 1.2 × 104 CFU/40 μl
(24 LD50) of the bioluminescent WT Y. pestis CO92 luc2 strain, which
contains the luciferase operon (luc), allowing in vivo imaging of mice for
bacterial dissemination in real time.23 On days 123 and 130 (day 3 and 10
p.i.), the animals were imaged by using an in vivo imaging system (IVIS) 200
bioluminescent and fluorescence whole-body imaging workstation (Caliper
Corp.; Alameda, CA, USA) in the ABSL-3 facility to examine dissemination
and progress of infection.
Rat studies.
Rats were immunised by the i.m. route with two doses
(2 × 106 CFU/100 μl, 21 days apart) of the Δlpp ΔmsbB Δail or the Δlpp
ΔmsbB Δpla mutant. One group of rats received PBS in lieu of bacteria, thus
representing a naive, unimmunized control group. Saphenous vein
bleeding of all rats occurred on days 0, 14, 35, 56, 77 and 88. Sera were
processed as described above for mice. Total IgG against F1-V in the sera

On day 42, spleens were isolated from rats (n = 3 per group per time
point) and were pretreated with ionomycin and PMA and then incubated
2 h later with Brefeldin A. The surface of the T cells was stained with
monoclonal
anti-rat
CD4-PE/Cy7
(BioLegend)
and
anti-rat
CD8-APC
(BioLegend) for 30 min in the dark at 4 °C to distinguish CD4+ and CD8−
expressing cells. Stained cells were centrifuged, washed and permeabilized
with Foxp3 staining buffer set (eBioscience). T cells were stained with anti-
rat IFN-γ-PE(BioLegend) and anti-rat IL-17A-Percp/Cy5.5 (eBioscience) for
30 min in the dark at 4 °C. Cells were analysed by Flow Cytometry as
described above.
Another set of immunised and PBS-injected control rats (n = 6 per group)
were exposed by the i.n. route with 1.6–2.3 × 104 CFU/50 μl (31–46 LD50)
on day 43 or day 91 of the WT CO92 luc2 strain. Animals were assessed for
morbidity and/or mortality for 2–3 weeks after the exposure. During the
second challenge (on day 91), blood and organs (lungs, liver and the
spleen) from surviving rats were collected on day 14 post challenge. An
aliquot (200 μl) of the blood and homogenised organs were plated on the
blood agar plates to examine the clearance of the challenge strain from
these rats.
Statistical analysis
For majority of the experiments, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and
two-way ANOVA were used with the Tukey's post hoc test for data analysis.
We used Kaplan–Meier survival estimates with log-rank (Mantel–Cox) test
for animal studies, and P values of ⩽ 0.05 were considered significant for all
of the statistical tests used.
