Background: We predicted cancer mortality figures in the European Union (EU) for the year 2017 using most recent available
data, with a focus on lung cancer.
Materials and methods: We retrieved cancer death certification data and population figures from the World Health
Organisation and Eurostat databases. Age-standardized (world standard population) rates were computed for France,
Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, the UK and the EU overall in 1970–2012. We obtained estimates for 2017 by implementing a join-
point regression model.
Results: The predicted number of cancer deaths for 2017 in the EU is 1 373 500, compared with 1 333 400 in 2012 (þ3%).
Cancer mortality rates are predicted to decline in both sexes, reaching 131.8/100 000 men (�8.2% when compared with 2012)
and 84.5/100 000 women (�3.6%). Mortality rates for all selected cancer sites are predicted to decline, except pancreatic
cancer in both sexes and lung cancer in women. In men, pancreatic cancer rate is stable, in women it increases by 3.5%. Lung
cancer mortality rate in women is predicted to rise to 14.6/100 000 in 2017 (þ5.1% since 2012, corresponding to 92 300
predicted deaths), compared with 14.0/100 000 for breast cancer, corresponding to 92 600 predicted deaths. Only younger
(25–44) women have favourable lung cancer trends, and rates at this age group are predicted to be similar in women (1.4/
100 000) and men (1.2/100 000). In men lung cancer rates are predicted to decline by 10.7% since 2012, and falls are observed
in all age groups.
Conclusion: European cancer mortality projections for 2017 confirm the overall downward trend in rates, with a stronger
pattern in men. This is mainly due to different smoking prevalence trends in different generations of men and women. Lung
cancer rates in young European women are comparable to those in men, confirming that smoking has the same impact on
lung cancer in the two sexes.

Introduction
Since official cancer mortality figures become available with a few
years lag, we developed a method to predict mortality figures for all
cancers and six major types of cancers in the European Union (EU)
and the six largest countries of the Union [1, 2]. We were also able
to validate our estimates [3]. Similar approaches have long been
used in the USA [4]. Despite uncertainties inherent in any predic-
tion, these are useful to understand patterns and trends in risk fac-
tor exposure for major cancers, and for public health planning.
In the present work, we predicted the number of cancer deaths
and mortality rates for 2017 with specific focus on lung cancer,
and its recent trends in the two sexes, various age groups and
countries [5, 6].
Materials and methods
This work updates the previous articles on European cancer mortality
predictions, and it uses similar methods [1–3].
We considered official death certification data for cancer of the stom-
ach, colorectum, pancreas, lung, breast, uterus (cervix and corpus), pros-
tate, as well as leukaemia and total neoplasms (malignant and benign)
from the WHO database (WHOSIS) [7].

 We derived figures for the EU (28 countries as of July 2013) in the
period 1970–2012 and up to the most recent available year for the 6 larg-
est EU countries: France (2013), Germany (2014), Italy (2012), Poland
(2014), Spain (2014) and the UK (2013).
Using the matrices of certified deaths and resident populations, we com-
puted age-specific death counts and rates for each 5-year age group (from
0–4 to 85þ years), sex and calendar year. We obtained age-standardized
rates (world standard population) per 100 000 men and women, at all ages,
using the direct method [8]. For lung cancer, we also computed rates for
the 25–44, 45–64, 65–74 and 75þ year age groups for the EU.
We fit a logarithmic Poisson count data joinpoint regression model to
the number of certified deaths in each 5-year age group in order to identify
the most recent trend segment [9]. Thus, we applied a linear regression to
mortality data for each 5-year age group over the most recent trend seg-
ment identified by the joinpoint model to compute the predicted age-
specific certified numbers of deaths and the corresponding 95% prediction
intervals (PIs). We estimated 95% PIs using a standard error accounting
for the variability of the new observation [10]. Predicted standardized
death rates with 95% PI were computed using the predicted age-specific
deaths counts and the predicted population data from Eurostat [11].
Results
Table 1 shows the total numbers of predicted cancer deaths
(rounded to the nearest hundred) and rates with the correspond-
ing 95% PIs for 2017, in the EU as a whole, for the neoplasms
under study. Table 1 also includes the 2012 recorded data.
Figure 1 shows bar plots of standardized death rates per
100 000 population for all cancers and the eight major cancer
sites, in men and women in 2012 (dark grey, blue online), and the
predicted values for 2017 (light grey, orange online) with corres-
ponding 95% PIs.
Overall, 1 373 500 EU deaths from cancer are predicted in 2017
(761 900 men and 611 600 women), when compared with
1 333 421 (745 281 men and 588 140 women) in 2012. The corres-
ponding projected age-standardized rates for 2017 are 131.8/
100 000 men and 84.5/100 000 women, compared with 143.5/
100 000 men and 87.7/100 000 women recorded in 2012. Thus, an
8.2% fall in rates for men and a 3.6% fall in women are predicted
between 2012 and 2017, while the absolute number of deaths is
expected to increase by about 40 000 (þ3.0%).
In the EU, in 2017, lung cancer has the highest predicted age-
standardized cancer mortality rate in both sexes. In men, the rate
is 33.3/100 000, corresponding to 183 400 predicted deaths (24%
of total male cancer deaths), and to a �10.7% fall in rates since
2012. In women, the predicted rate is 14.6/100 000, correspond-
ing to 92 300 deaths (15% of total female cancer deaths) and a
5.1% rise in rates since 2012. Overall, lung cancer is predicted to
cause 275 700 deaths in both sexes combined in 2017, corres-
ponding to about 20% total cancer deaths.
Breast cancer projected rate in 2017 is 14.0/100 000 women, the
second highest rate in women. However, the total number of
deaths remains slightly higher for breast cancer (92 600) than for
lung cancer. Between the ages of 45 and 74 years, more deaths
from lung than breast cancer were predicted, while in young and
elderly women breast cancer deaths remain more frequent.
Colorectal cancer has predicted rates of 16.1 in men and
9.3/100 000 in women, corresponding to 97 100 deaths in men
and 78 600 in women (about 13% of total cancer deaths in both
sexes), and with, respectively, 5.3% and 6.7% falls in rates since
2012. Prostate cancer has the third highest projected rate
(10.3/100 000 with a 6.9% fall since 2012), and accounts for about

 10% of the total cancer deaths in men. Pancreatic cancer rates
remain approximately stable in men, with a predicted rate of
7.9/100 000, while in women it rises to 5.6/100 000 (þ3.5%, com-
pared with 2012). The total number of pancreatic cancer deaths
(87 400) corresponds to about 6% of all cancer deaths. Cancers of
the uterus, stomach and leukaemias represent 2, 4 and 3%, re-
spectively, of total cancer deaths, and their falls since 2012 ranged
between �16% (stomach in men) and �5% (uterus).
Figure 2 gives trends in all ages total cancer mortality rates for
men and women in the EU overall in quinquennia centred from
1972 to 2012, and the predicted rates for 2017 with PIs. In men,
rates have been declining since the late 1980s, while in women
rates declined during the whole studied period. However, recent
falls were largest in men.
Figure 3 shows mortality trends for each selected cancer site in
the EU. Stomach cancer has the greatest proportional falls in mor-
tality in both sexes. Lung cancer in men also shows considerable falls
in mortality since 1990, as well as breast cancer in women.
Pancreatic cancer in men shows an approximately stable trend over
the last few years, while in women the rate rises steadily. Lung cancer
in women shows a steady upward trend over the entire period. The
supplementary appendix, available at Annals of Oncology online,
provides country-specific data and analyses (supplementary Tables
S1–S9 and Figure S1, available at Annals of Oncology online).
Table 2 gives all ages standardized mortality rates for lung can-
cer in the 2005–2009 quinquennium and in 2012, the predicted
age standardized rate for 2017 and the percent difference between
2017 and 2012, in the six selected countries and in the EU as a
whole. Moreover, for the EU, Table 2 shows specific figures for
the age groups 25–44, 45–64, 65–74 and 75þ years.
In 2005–2009, overall lung cancer mortality rates among men
ranged between 33.1 (the UK) and 62.0/100 000 men (Poland);
all countries show downwards trends for 2017 between 25.7 (the
UK) and 46.8/100 000 men (Poland). The overall decline in EU
male, between 2012 and 2017, is 10.7%, and in all age groups the
patterns are favourable, particularly in the 25–44 group
(�48.5%). In women, the lowest rate for 2005–2009 was 6.3 in
Spain, while the highest was 20.5/100 000 in the UK. Apart from
the UK, all countries have unfavourable trends and predicted
rates vary between 8.8 (Spain) and 19.1/100 000 women (the
UK). Only young women show favourable patterns (�15.1%).
Figure 4 shows joinpoint analysis for lung cancer age-
standardized mortality rates for the EU, in both sexes, in the five
studied age groups, along with predictions for 2017 and corres-
ponding PIs. In men, all age groups display a downward trend
since late 1980s/early 1990s. Women aged 25–44 years increased
up to the late 1980s, and decline moderately thereafter. All other
age groups show upwards trends.
Figure 5 gives the estimated number of avoided cancer deaths
for EU men and women between the top rate in 1988 and 2017
(light grey area, light green online). Over the 30 years period con-
sidered, 2 893 054 cancer deaths in men and 1 471 216 in women
(for a total of 4 364 270) have been avoided. In 2017, 253 915 are
predicted to be avoided in men and 107 780 in women, for a total
of 361 695.
Discussion
EU mortality rates from all cancers combined and from most
site-specific cancers are predicted to further fall to 2017, confirm-
ing the favourable trends in cancer mortality registered in Europe
and other areas of the world over the last two decades [12, 13].
However, the fall in age-standardized rates is not reflected in the
total number of deaths, since these are still expected to rise mod-
erately, due to the continuous population’s increase in size and
ageing [14]. Despite a steady substantial decline in breast cancer
mortality, the predicted fall in overall cancer mortality was
smaller in women than in men (�4% versus �8%).
This essentially reflects the different trends in lung and other
tobacco-related cancers between the two sexes [15]. In fact, lung
cancer mortality in women is still rising, to reach an overall pre-
dicted rate of 14.6/100 000 in 2017, while it is decreasing by 11%
in men. In the age group 25–44, predicted lung cancer rates in the
EU are similar in men and women, reflecting the similar smoking
patterns in the young generations of the two sexes over recent

 decades [16]. This confirms that the impact of smoking on lung
cancer is the same in men and women [17]. Despite the persisting
unfavourable trends, female lung cancer rates remain consistently
lower in the EU (except the UK and Poland) than in the USA [4],
and are unlikely to reach the high levels reached in the USA dur-
ing the 1990s [18]. Only in the UK, where female lung cancer
rates approached 20/100 000, trends appear to be levelling off,
but the rise in other countries remains substantial, particularly in
France and Spain, where smoking became common in women in
the 1970s [19]. In general, all former non-market economy coun-
tries of central and eastern Europe have higher lung cancer rates
in men, and the pattern of trends reported for Poland are reason-
ably representative of the area.
The other major neoplasm showing no favourable predictions
is pancreatic cancer. Similar trends were registered for the
USA [4, 20]. Tobacco is the major recognized risk factor for
pancreatic cancer, but its attributable fraction is 15–25% in most
populations [21, 22]. Thus, at least in men, some fall would have
been expected, and indeed the recent trends were no longer ris-
ing. No real progress has been made in the screening, manage-
ment and treatment of pancreatic cancer, and the increased
prevalence of overweight, obesity and diabetes, mostly in north-
ern Europe, may have unfavourably affected pancreatic cancer
rates [23].
The predicted downward trends for colorectal cancer and
leukaemias in both sexes, as well as for cancers of the prostate
[24], breast and uterus [25], likely reflect improved diagnoses,
management and treatment of these neoplasms over the last three
decades [26, 27] and are expected to continue in the near future.
Likewise, continuous falls are predicted for gastric cancer,
probably due to the long term effects of the decreased prevalence
of Helicobacter pylori infection in subsequent generations and

 across countries [28]. Still, major differences in gastric cancer
mortality remain across Europe [29], with rates about twice as
high in Poland compared with the UK.
Short term predictions of deaths and rates from major cancer
sites provide a reasonable picture of current cancer burden in the
EU, and have proven to be satisfactory robust for the EU and its
major countries [3]. Still, none of the proposed models is able to
estimate sudden fluctuations or major changes in slopes. Thus, as
for any prediction, due caution is required for interpretation and
inference.
In conclusion, cancer mortality rates are predicted to decline
further in the EU, mainly in men following the decreased preva-
lence of smoking in subsequent generations in recent calendar
decades. The persistent unfavourable trends in female lung cancer
resulted in similar mortality rates in both sexes in the young, con-
firming the similar impact of tobacco on lung cancer in men and
women.
