Abstract
Background: Chronic inflammation and oxidative balance are associated with poor diet quality and risk of cancer and other
chronic diseases. A diet–inflammation/oxidative balance association may relate to evolutionary discordance.
Objective: We investigated associations between 2 diet pattern scores, the Paleolithic and the Mediterranean, and
circulating concentrations of 2 related biomarkers, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), an acute inflammatory
protein, and F2-isoprostane, a reliable marker of in vivo lipid peroxidation.
Methods: In a pooled cross-sectional study of 30- to 74-y-old men and women in an elective outpatient colonoscopy
population (n = 646), we created diet scores from responses on Willett food-frequency questionnaires and measured
plasma hsCRP and F2-isoprostane concentrations by ELISA and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry, respectively.
Both diet scores were calculated and categorized into quintiles, and their associations with biomarker concentrations were
estimated with the use of general linear models to calculate and compare adjusted geometric means, and via unconditional
ordinal logistic regression.
Results: There were statistically significant trends for decreasing geometric mean plasma hsCRP and F2-isoprostane
concentrations with increasing quintiles of the Paleolithic and Mediterranean diet scores. The multivariable-adjusted ORs
comparing those in the highest with those in the lowest quintiles of the Paleolithic and Mediterranean diet scores were
0.61 (95% CI: 0.36, 1.05; P-trend = 0.06) and 0.71 (95% CI: 0.42, 1.20; P-trend = 0.01), respectively, for a higher hsCRP
concentration, and 0.51 (95% CI: 0.27, 0.95; P-trend 0.01) and 0.39 (95% CI: 0.21, 0.73; P-trend = 0.01), respectively, for a
higher F2-isoprostane concentration.
Conclusion: These findings suggest that diets that are more Paleolithic- or Mediterranean-like may be associated with
lower levels of systemic inflammation and oxidative stress in humans.

Introduction
Chronic inflammation is associated with many chronic diseases
that have become increasingly common in the Western world
(1). Reactive oxygen species can cause lipid peroxidation (2), a
major result and indicator of oxidative stress (3), and oxidative
stress can increase inflammation and vice versa (4). Both chronic
inflammation and oxidative stress have been associated with
cardiovascular disease (5, 6), cancer (7–10), and other chronic
diseases (11). Several dietary factors influence a person�s chronic
inflammation level (12, 13). For example, a higher ratio of v-6
to v-3 FAs, a high intake of saturated fat or foods with a high
glycemic load, and lower dietary fiber intake are associated with
higher inflammation levels (12). Investigations into which foods
alter systemic inflammation and oxidative balance led to several
large clinical trials of nutritional supplementation to prevent

 cardiovascular disease (14) and cancer (15, 16), most finding
limited effects and even harm in some instances (17–20).
Although there are many reasons why these trials might not have
found the expected benefits, it may be that, at least in part, the
nutritional supplements used in the trials cannot sufficiently
address the relevant complex and likely interacting components
of diet (21–23).
To better capture the potential synergistic effects of food
constituents in a complex diet, nutrition researchers have used
dietary patterns. Dietary patterns can be entirely data driven,
decided entirely a priori, or a combination thereof, and they can
be used to quantify a person�s entire diet, rather than its
individual components. One such pattern that is of increasing
interest is a Paleolithic diet pattern. The Paleolithic diet of
preagricultural hunter-gatherer humans was estimated from
anthropologic evidence from fossils and extant hunter-gatherer
groups (24). The diet pattern is characterized as a predominantly
plant-food–based diet, with a wide diversity of fruits, nuts, and
vegetables, and very little to no grains, dairy products, or sugar.
It is also high in calcium and other minerals, which are found in
relatively high amounts in various wild plant foods (24). The
consequences of the discrepancies between the diets and lifestyles
of Homo sapiens before the agricultural revolution and those
during the modern, postindustrial revolution era are referred to as
evolutionary discordance, and they have been proposed to account
for some of the dramatic increase in chronic disease in the past
century (25). To our knowledge, there has been very limited study
of this diet reported in the scientific literature, with some
indications that it may improve cardiovascular and meta-
bolic biomarkers (26–32), perhaps similar to or even more so
than a Mediterranean diet (28, 33). The Mediterranean diet is
considered to be one of the healthiest diets for preventing many
chronic diseases (34–36), and it is associated with lower concen-
trations of biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress
(37–39). The Mediterranean diet is similar to the Paleolithic
diet in that it emphasizes a high consumption of fruits, vege-
tables, and lean meats, with little added sugars; but, unlike a
Paleolithic diet, it is characterized by a moderate intake of dairy,
grains, and alcohol (40).
We previously reported an inverse association of Paleolithic
and Mediterranean diet scores with incident sporadic colorectal
adenoma (33). In this paper we present a cross-sectional analysis
of data from another pooled elective, outpatient colonoscopy
population, to 1) investigate the association of a Paleolithic diet
score with circulating markers of inflammation [high-sensitivity
C-reactive protein (hsCRP)9] and oxidative stress (F2-isoprostanes),
and 2) compare these findings with those from a parallel analysis
of associations of a Mediterranean diet score with the same
markers.
Methods
Study population and data collection. Data from 2 methodically
similar studies, both cross-sectional studies of elective outpatient
colonoscopy populations conducted by the same principal investigator
(RMB), were pooled. The first study, Markers of Adenomatous Polyps I
(MAPI), was conducted from 1994–1997 in Winston-Salem and
Charlotte, North Carolina, and the second, Markers of Adenomatous
Polyps II (MAPII), was conducted in 2002 in Columbia, South Carolina.
Participants in the 2 studies were recruited from patients with no prior
history of colorectal neoplasms who were scheduled for an elective
outpatient colonoscopy for colorectal cancer screening or gastrointes-
tinal symptoms in several large community-based gastroenterology
practices. Initial eligibility for participation in both studies required
that patients be 30–74 y old; English speaking; free of known genetic
syndromes associated with a predisposition to colonic neoplasia; and
with no individual history of inflammatory bowel disease, adenoma-
tous polyps, or cancers except for nonmelanoma skin cancer.
In MAPI, 669 (30%) of the 2246 colonoscopy patients identified met
these eligibility criteria; 617 (92%) were contacted, and 472 (76%)
consented to participate. In MAPII, 305 (87%) of the 351 colonoscopy
patients identified were eligible and 203 (67%) agreed to participate. We
combined the 2 studies, because their selection criteria, study protocols,
and questionnaires were nearly identical. Details of the study protocols
for MAPI and MAPII were previously reported (41–46). An additional
33 participants were excluded from the present analyses because of
implausibly low or high estimated total energy intake (<500 or >5000 kcal/d).
The study protocols for both studies were approved by the respective
institutional review boards of the corresponding institutions, and all
participants provided informed consent.
Mailed questionnaires were completed at home and collected at the
colonoscopy visit. Study participants provided detailed information on
demographic characteristics, personal medical history, smoking history,
usual physical activity (via a modified Paffenbarger questionnaire),
anthropometric characteristics, reproductive history and hormone use
(women only), and family history of cancer. Frequency of aspirin and
other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use were assessed
as the number of pills taken per week. A 153-item (MAPI) or 85-item
(MAPII) self-administered semiquantitative Willett FFQ was com-
pleted before colonoscopy to assess food and nutritional supplement
intake over the previous 12 mo. A standard portion size and 9 possible
frequency-of-consumption responses, ranging from ‘‘never, or less than
once per month’’ to ‘‘6 or more times per day’’ were given for each item.
Total daily energy and nutrient intake was calculated by summing
energy and nutrients from all food sources with the use of the dietary
database developed by Willett (47, 48).
On the day of the colonoscopy, fasting peripheral venous blood
samples were drawn into red-coated, prechilled tubes and then imme-
diately placed on ice and shielded from light to prevent sample
degradation. Blood fractions were portioned into amber-colored cryo-
preservation tubes, air was displaced with an inert gas (nitrogen in MAPI
and argon in MAPII), and then the aliquots were placed immediately in a
280�C freezer until analysis. The present study was conducted after
most of the stored plasma samples were exhausted from prior studies;
samples for hsCRP were available on 87% (n = 558) of the eligible
participants, and samples for F2-isoprostanes were available on 67.6%
(n = 434) of eligible participants; the analyses reported herein are based
on these sample sizes (Figure 1).
hsCRP was measured via latex-enhanced immunonephelometry on
a Behring nephelometer II analyzer (interassay CV: 4%; Behering
Diagnostics). F2-isoprostanes were measured via a highly specific and
quantitative gas chromatography–mass spectrometry method (49) by
the Molecular Epidemiology and Biomarker Research Laboratory at
the University of Minnesota. This method, considered to be the gold
standard for measuring F2-isoprostanes, measures a well-defined set of
F2-isoprostane isomers. These were extracted from participants� samples
with the use of deuterium-labeled (4) 8-iso-prostaglandin F2a as an
internal standard. Quality control procedures included the analysis of 2
control pools that had varying concentration ranges of F2-isoprostanes
(CV: 9.5% and 11%, respectively).
Dietary scores. The Paleolithic and Mediterranean diet pattern scores
were constructed as described previously (33). Briefly, for each score,
each study participant was assigned a quintile rank (and score from 1–5)
of intake for each score component (Paleolithic diet score—14 compo-
nents; Mediterranean diet score—11 components), based on the sex-
specific distributions in each original study population. For the most
part, higher points were given for a higher intake of foods considered to
be characteristic of a given score or for low to no consumption of foods
considered to be uncharacteristic of that dietary pattern (Table 1). For

 the Mediterranean diet, this scheme was modified in relation to dairy,
grains and starches, and alcohol intake, as noted in Table 1. For the
Paleolithic diet score, 2 unique variables were created. The first, a fruit
and vegetable diversity score, was created by summing the total number
of responses on the fruit and vegetable sections of the FFQ that indicated
that the participant had eaten >1–3 servings of a given food item/mo.
More diversity was considered desirable. Second, because the Paleolithic
diet had little dairy but high amounts of calcium (from wild plant foods)
(24), to consider dietary calcium separately from dairy products, we used
the residuals of a linear regression of total (i.e., dietary plus supplemen-
tal) calcium on total dairy intake to represent calcium intake indepen-
dent of dairy consumption. The points for each food component were
then summed to create the final diet pattern score. The final scores could
range from 14–70 for the 14-component Paleolithic diet score and 11–55
for the 11-component Mediterranean diet score.
Statistical analysis. The characteristics of the study population, by
quintile of each diet pattern score, were summarized and compared by
using chi-square tests for categorical variables and for continuous
variables following a normal distribution, or the Kruskal-Wallis
nonparametric test for continuous variables that did not follow a
normal distribution. Because the distributions of hsCRP and F2-
isoprostanes were right skewed, their values were transformed by ln, and
then the adjusted geometric means 6 SEs by quintile of each dietary
pattern were computed by using a general linear model (implemented
with the use of the SAS GLM procedure), controlling for potential
confounding by other factors. Correlations between the 2 scores were
assessed with the use of a Spearman correlation coefficient. To facilitate
interpretation and comparisons between the relative strengths of the diet
pattern–biomarker associations, ordinal logistic regression analysis also
was used, in which hsCRP and F2-isoprostane concentrations were
categorized into quintiles based on the sex-specific concentrations in
the pooled study population. The multivariable unconditional ordinal
logistic regression models were used to calculate ORs and 95% CIs
for associations of each dietary score with each sex-specific quintile

 increase in each biomarker. The median of each diet score quintile was
used for calculating all tests for trend.
Based on previous literature and biological plausibility, potential
confounding variables considered included the study (MAPI or MAPII),
regular NSAID or aspirin use ($4 times/wk), age, total energy intake,
hormone replacement use (in women), sex, current smoking status, BMI,
education, physical activity, regular multivitamin use, season of the year
the questionnaire was filled out, race, and family history of colon cancer
in a first-degree relative. Inclusion in the final models required $1 of the
following criteria: biological plausibility, statistical significance, and/or
whether inclusion/exclusion of the variable from the model changed the
adjusted OR for the primary exposure variable by $10%. The final
adjusted models controlled for study (MAPI or MAPII), regular NSAID
or aspirin use ($4 times/wk), age, total energy intake (kilocalories;
continuous), regular hormone replacement use (in women), sex, smoking
(current or former/never), BMI (in kg/m2; categorized by WHO criteria
into normal/underweight, overweight, and obese), education (no college
education or some college education), physical activity (high or low
based on the study population median weekly metabolic equivalent
task–hour per week expenditure from moderate and vigorous activities),
regular multivitamin use ($3 times/wk), and the season of the year the
questionnaire was filled out.
To assess potential effect measure modification, separate analyses
were conducted within dichotomous categories (as defined above) of
smoking (current or former/never), BMI (underweight/normal or
overweight/obese), sex, NSAID and aspirin use (regular or nonregular
users), multivitamin use (regular or nonregular users), physical activity
(higher or lower than the pooled study population�s median of 195.5
metabolic equivalent task–h/wk), age (younger or older than the pooled
study population�s median age of 56.9 y), and education (any college or
no college).
To assess the sensitivity of the observed associations to how we
defined the scores, each food component was removed from each a
priori score one at a time to determine whether any one component
substantially influenced the diet score–biomarker associations. Diet
scores also were constructed with the use of medians rather than
quintiles for the food groups, and an alternative calculation of the fat
ratio variable (mono- plus polyunsaturated fat:saturated fat) was used
for the Mediterranean diet score. The presence of colon or rectal
adenomas in this study population was also assessed as a potential
confounder and an effect measure modifier. All analyses were
conducted with the use of SAS statistical software, version 9.3).
Two-sided tests were considered to be statistically significant at
P # 0.05.

 Results
Selected characteristics of the participants by diet score quintile
are summarized in Table 2 (Paleolithic diet score) and Table 3
(Mediterranean diet score). Compared with those in the lowest
quintile of the Paleolithic diet score, those in the highest quintile
on average were older; were less likely to smoke; were more
likely to have a bachelor�s degree or higher; and consumed less
total energy, more calcium (mainly via supplements), more
dietary fiber and vegetables, more v-3 FAs per gram of v-6 FAs,
and less fat and red and processed meat. The descriptive
comparisons for the Mediterranean diet score were similar to
those for the Paleolithic diet score. The Paleolithic diet score
ranged from 25 to 62, whereas the Mediterranean diet score
ranged from 14 to 48; the mean score for each diet pattern did
not differ appreciably between the 2 original study populations.
Also, the score ranges did not differ appreciably by sex, and the
correlation between the scores was linear (r = 0.72, P = 0.01).
For each quintile of the Paleolithic diet score, the percentages of
participants who were in the same or different quintiles of the
Mediterranean diet score are shown in Table 4. Among those
in the lowest and highest quintiles of the Paleolithic diet score,
62.6% and 55.8%, respectively, were in the corresponding
quintile of the Mediterranean diet score.
The multivariable-adjusted geometric means of serum hsCRP
and F2-isoprostanes for each quintile of each dietary pattern
score are presented in Table 5. For each diet pattern, there was a
pattern of decreasing hsCRP and F2-isoprostane concentrations
with increasing diet score quintile. For those in the highest
compared with the lowest quintile of the Paleolithic and
Mediterranean diet scores, the geometric mean hsCRP con-
centrations were proportionately 31% and 19% lower, respec-
tively, and the geometric mean F2-isoprostane concentrations
were proportionately 11% and 16% lower, respectively. The
P-trend was statistically significant for each biomarker for each
diet pattern.
For additional perspective, the overall associations of the
diet scores with each serum biomarker from the ordinal
logistic regression analyses are presented in Table 5. In the
multivariable-adjusted analyses, all tests for trend, except for the

 association of the Paleolithic diet score hsCRP, were statisti-
cally significant. For those in the upper compared with those in
the lowest quintile of the Paleolithic and Mediterranean diet
scores, there was an estimated 37% and 29% lower odds,
respectively, of having a higher plasma hsCRP concentration
and an estimated 49% and 61% lower odds, respectively, of
having a higher plasma F2-isoprostane concentration.
The results of analyses of the diet–biomarker associations
stratified by age, sex, education, current smoking status, current
NSAID/aspirin use, and physical activity are summarized in
Figures 2 and 3 (see Supplemental Table 1 for all exact geometric
means). The inverse associations of the Paleolithic diet score
with hsCRP concentrations tended to be stronger in participants
who were current smokers, overweight/obese, or less physically
active, or who did not attend college. For the Mediterranean diet
score and hsCRP, the inverse association was stronger in those
who did not attend college (P-interaction = 0.02). The inverse
associations of the Paleolithic diet with F2-isoprostane concen-
trations tended to be stronger in those who were female,
younger (P-interaction = 0.04), or current smokers, or those
with some college education (P-interaction = 0.03); whereas
for the Mediterranean diet score, the inverse association was
stronger in those who were female or younger, or had low
physical activity levels or some college education (no statistically
significant tests for multiplicative interaction).
In the sensitivity analyses in which each component of each
dietary score was removed individually to determine its influence
on the observed associations, no single component substan-
tially altered the associations between the diet scores and
concentrations of either biomarker. Yet, removing some com-
ponents that most clearly define the differences between the 2
scores (e.g., grain, dairy, fruit, and vegetable diversity) did
lessen the differences between the associations of the 2 scores
with F2-isoprostanes (data not shown). Combining all red meats,
separating all red meats from processed meats, and awarding
points for more consumption of all red meats and for less
consumption of processed meats did not alter the observed
associations materially. There were also no appreciable differ-
ences in diet–biomarker associations between those found to
have colorectal adenomas at their colonoscopy and those who
did not, and including adenomas as a covariate in the models did
not appreciably alter the estimated associations.

 Discussion
Our results suggest that diets that are more Paleolithic- or
Mediterranean-like may be associated with lower levels of
systemic inflammation and oxidative stress. Although the 2
diet patterns are similar in some but not all respects, and the
overlap in how persons in this study were categorized was
only moderate, the associations of the 2 diet patterns with
the markers of inflammation and oxidative stress were quite
similar. Our results also suggest that the Paleolithic diet–
biomarker associations may be stronger in those who smoke,
and that for either diet score, the association with F2-
isoprostanes may be stronger in those who are younger.
Although there were other differences across subgroups, they
were not consistent across diets or biomarkers.
Both the Paleolithic and Mediterranean diet patterns have
elements that may reduce chronic inflammation or improve
oxidative balance. Both are high in fruits, vegetables, fish, and
nuts; have more antioxidant and fewer pro-oxidant nutrients, a
more favorable v-6:v-3 FA ratio, and a lower glycemic load; and
are less energy dense than a Western diet [likely leading to an
improved energy balance (12, 13)], all of which are thought to
improve systemic inflammation and oxidative balance. Research
into other dietary patterns would tend to support these
mechanisms. Diets that are meat-based or Western-like tend to
be associated directly with inflammation biomarker concentra-
tions, whereas produce-based, or ‘‘healthy’’ diet patterns are
usually inversely associated with them (13, 37, 50, 51). Studies
of other diets that are similar to the produce-based diets also
found inverse associations with systemic inflammation bio-
marker concentrations; other such diets included those with a
low glycemic load (52) or high fiber (53), those that replaced
SFAs with PUFAs (54), and low-carbohydrate diets (55, 56).
More comprehensive diet patterns, such as a healthy Nordic diet
(57) and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet,
were also associated with lower concentrations of inflammation
biomarkers and improved oxidative balance (58–63), and may
share underlying mechanisms with the 2 dietary patterns
examined in this paper.
To our knowledge, there are few reported studies of a
Paleolithic diet pattern in relation to biomarkers of disease risk.
Six small pilot trials that examined the effects of a Paleolithic
diet on cardiovascular disease risk and glycemic control
biomarkers, such as glycated hemoglobin, plasma insulin, blood
pressure, and serum TGs and cholesterol (26–31), generally
observed improvements in these markers, although only 3 of
these pilot trials had a control group (27–29). A slightly larger
study (n = 70) of the effects of a Paleolithic diet on long-term
weight loss found statistically significant greater weight loss at
6 mo in the Paleolithic diet group than in the control group,
although the difference mostly dissipated after 24 mo (32).
Maintenance of a more normal body weight may be one way a
Paleolithic diet may maintain lower levels of inflammation and
oxidative stress. However, because we controlled for BMI in our
models, our findings suggest that a Paleolithic diet may also
reduce inflammation and oxidative stress via other mechanisms.
In further, although indirect, support of the inverse associations
found in the present study of the 2 diet pattern scores with
inflammation and oxidative stress levels, in part because
colorectal neoplasms are thought to be associated with inflam-
mation and oxidative stress (45, 46, 64–66), we previously
investigated associations of the 2 diet pattern scores with
incident, sporadic colorectal adenoma in a case-control study in
a different population from that reported herein (33). In that

 study we found that both diets were similarly inversely associ-
ated with adenoma (33).
The Mediterranean diet was associated with lower circu-
lating concentrations of biomarkers of inflammation and
oxidative stress in several prior studies. This diet generally has
been more strongly inversely associated with hsCRP than have
other healthy diet patterns reported in the literature (37), and
greater adherence to a Mediterranean diet pattern also has
been associated with lower F2-isoprostane concentrations, as
well as with other biomarkers of lipid peroxidation (38). In the
Prevenci´
on con Dieta Mediterr´
anea substudy (n = 110) of
participants with metabolic syndrome, those randomly as-
signed to a Mediterranean diet supplemented with either olive
oil or nuts were estimated to have an almost 50% greater
reduction in mean F2-isoprostane concentrations (P = 0.06)
than did those in the comparison diet arm after 1 y (39). The
results of the current study support these previously published
findings.
Unlike most diet patterns, for which stronger inverse asso-
ciations for a wide range of outcomes are usually observed for
men but not women (22), we found the Paleolithic and
Mediterranean diet patterns to be more strongly inversely
associated with the biomarkers—especially F2-isoprostanes—in
women. However, the tests for interaction mostly were not
statistically significant, and our sex-specific findings may be
due to the sex-specific diet scoring procedure we used, which
allowed for different consumption patterns across the sexes.
This study has several strengths and limitations. Strengths
include that, to our knowledge, it is the first investigation of
associations of a Paleolithic diet pattern with biomarkers of
inflammation or oxidative stress. The Paleolithic and the
Mediterranean diet patterns were constructed with the use of
similar methods, so differences in the findings for the 2 diets
would be attributable to the differences in the dietary patterns,
rather than to the mechanics of how the scores were
constructed. Limitations include the fact that participants�
diets were not perfectly consistent with the ideal of either
pattern; however, this likely yielded more modest inverse
associations with hsCRP and F2-isoprostanes than would be
expected with stronger adherence, and it suggests that even
moderate adherence to one of the diet patterns may be
associated with lower levels of inflammation and oxidative
balance. Other limitations include the study�s cross-sectional
design, the known limitations of assessing diet with self-
reported semiquantitative FFQs (47, 67), and the limited
number of biomarkers to characterize inflammation and
oxidative balance. The 2 original studies that were pooled for
the present analysis used different versions of the Willett FFQ;
however, within each study, the diet pattern components and
scores were similarly highly correlated. Last, individuals
undergoing elective outpatient colonoscopy may not be repre-
sentative of the general US population.
In conclusion, our findings, taken together with those
from previous studies, suggest that diets that are more
Paleolithic- or Mediterranean-like may be associated with lower
levels of systemic inflammation and oxidative stress in humans.
