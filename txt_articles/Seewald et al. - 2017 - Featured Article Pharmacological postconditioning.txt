Impact statement
In this study, we found that postcondi-
tioning with Deltorphin D significantly
improved diastolic relaxation and
decreased the incidence of ventricular
arrhythmias during early reperfusion.
Furthermore, these treated hearts demon-
strated increased tissue perfusion after 2 h,
suggesting improved microvascular func-
tion. Delta opioid agonists attenuated
reperfusion injury, suggestive of a post-
conditioning effect. Such agents may have
a potential role in minimizing reperfusion
injury associated with coronary stenting,
bypass surgery, myocardial infarction,
cardiac transplantation, or with the utiliza-
tion of heart preservation systems.
Abstract
Ischemic preconditioning has been utilized to protect the heart from ischemia prior to
ischemia onset, whereas postconditioning is employed to minimize the consequences of
ischemia at the onset of reperfusion. The underlying mechanisms and pathways of ischemic
pre- and postconditioning continue to be investigated as therapeutic targets. We evaluated
the administration of a delta opioid agonist or cariporide on various parameters associated
with myocardial reperfusion injury upon reperfusion of isolated porcine hearts. The hearts
were reperfused in vitro with a Krebs buffer containing either: (1) 1 mM Deltorphin D (delta
opioid specific agonist, n ¼ 6); (2) 3 mM cariporide (sodium–hydrogen exchange inhibitor,
n ¼ 4); or (3) no treatment (control, n ¼ 6). Subsequently, postischemic hemodynamic per-
formance, arrhythmia burden, relative tissue perfusion, and development of necrosis were
assessed over a 2 h reperfusion period. Postconditioning with Deltorphin D significantly
improved diastolic relaxation (Tau, P < 0.05 versus controls) and decreased the incidence
of ventricular arrhythmias during early reperfusion. Additionally, these treated hearts demonstrated increased tissue perfusion
after 2 h (P < 0.05 versus controls), suggesting improved microvascular function. Delta opioid agonists elicited the potential to
attenuate reperfusion injury, suggesting a postconditioning effect of these agents. We hypothesize that the induced benefits of
delta opioids, in part, are associated with decreased calcium influx on reperfusion, independent of sodium–hydrogen exchange
inhibition. Such agents may have a potential role in minimizing reperfusion injury associated with coronary stenting, bypass
surgery, myocardial infarction, cardiac transplantation, or with the utilization of heart preservation systems.

Introduction
Reperfusion injury is a paradox by which reperfusion,
ultimately the most beneficial treatment after myocardial
ischemia, causes additional injury to the myocardium.
Characteristics of reperfusion injury after ischemia involve,
but may not be limited to, myocardial stunning, arrhyth-
mias, no-reflow phenomenon (microvascular damage),
and
accelerated
cell
death.1
Furthermore,
additional
delayed injury may occur as molecular signals released
from injured cells can induce apoptosis in bordering healthy
cells.
Importantly,
reperfusion
injury
can
potentially
account for an estimated 25–60% of the total infarct
volume following transient ischemia and reperfusion.2,3
Therefore, any potential reduction of reperfusion injury
remains of great clinical interest, e.g. reperfusion injury
after percutaneous coronary interventions, fibrinolysis, or
after cardiac bypass surgery. Other relevant clinical scen-
arios
may
include
cardiac
transplantation
and,
most
recently, assessment of ex vivo function prior to and as a
bridge transplantation, for instance in TransMedic’s Organ
CareTM System (Andover, MA, USA).4,5
Opioids have been reported to be beneficial when asso-
ciated with either ischemic preconditioning6 or pharmaco-
logical preconditioning, not only in animal models1,7–14 but
also in humans.15,16 The induced effects included antiar-
rhythmic and anti-ischemic as well as cardioprotective
benefits
through
various
signaling
mechanisms.

 adaptation to ischemia observed in humans after two
sequential coronary balloon inflations was abolished by
naloxone, an opioid antagonist,15 and the opioid receptor
agonist DADLE was shown to precondition isolated human
atrial trabeculae.16 Moreover, opioids are commonly used in
the intensive care unit for patients suffering from cardiac
diseases requiring sedation, intubation, and cardiopulmon-
ary resuscitation among other treatments.17 While ischemic
and opioid preconditioning have been convincingly shown
to delay cell death in various experimental models, to date,
the relative clinical applicability of the aforementioned
observations has been limited to situations where the ische-
mic event can be anticipated. Yet, there is proven evidence
that brief bouts of ischemia, subsequent to a prolonged
ischemic event (ischemic postconditioning), can confer car-
dioprotection against reperfusion injury.18,19 Furthermore,
pharmacological preconditioning agents (such as adeno-
sine, bradykinin, and isoflurane) have also been shown to
attenuate reperfusion injury when administered following
ischemia. If pharmacological postconditioning could be
shown to be beneficial for minimizing reperfusion injury,
the administration of such agents could even be applied
after restoration of blood flow. Opioid postconditioning
has the potential to be developed into a safe and non-inva-
sive therapeutic approach to reduce cardiac reperfusion
injuries.20–26
It was initially assumed that cardioprotection would occur
only when opioids were given prior to, but not during ische-
mia, i.e. as a cardioplegia additive.8,27 However, it has been
subsequently shown that opioids attenuate reperfusion injury
when administered upon reperfusion and even during a
defined
time
frame
up
to
30 min
afterward.11,26,28
Deltorphin D is a specific delta opioid receptor agonist.29,30
Significant myocardial infarct size reductions were observed
when preconditioning swine with Deltorphin D at a dose of
1mg/kg, compared with controls.10
The overall aim of the present study was to investigate the
ability of Deltorphin D to reduce reperfusion injury when
administered as a supplement to the reperfusion buffer.
Specifically, four parameters of reperfusion injury (myocar-
dial stunning, arrhythmias, microvascular damage, and
necrosis) were quantified. We employed an isolated working
porcine heart model, which became subject to global ische-
mia; this model may mirror, to some degree, a transplant
procedure or application of an ex vivo perfusion device. In
addition, cariporide, a sodium–hydrogen exchange (NHE)
blocker and an agent previously shown to attenuate reperfu-
sion injury, was administered upon reperfusion and result-
ing effects were compared between therapies.1
Materials and methods
This study was conducted in accordance with the Guide for
the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals after approval from
the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the
University of Minnesota.
Working isolated heart preparation
Briefly, swine (75–85 kg) were sedated with thiopental, then
intubated and mechanically ventilated. Anesthesia was
maintained using isoflurane and a 2:1 air-to-oxygen mix-
ture. Medial sternotomies were performed exposing the
hearts and major cardiac vessels. After cross-clamping of
the aorta and great vessels, the hearts were arrested using
cold (4�C) St. Thomas Hospital cardioplegia (110 mM NaCl,
16 mM KCl, 1.2 mM CaCl2, 16 mM MgCl2, 10 mM NaHCO3)
administered under pressure (�70 mmHg) via cannulas
inserted into the ascending aortas. The hearts were excised
and placed in a saline buffer slurry while the major vessels
of the hearts were cannulated. Cardioplegia perfusion was
maintained throughout the cannulation process to ensure
the arrested state. The major vessels of the left ventricles
(pulmonary veins and aortas) were fitted with clear tygon
tubing cannulas and connected to the isolated heart appar-
atus. The hearts were then reperfused with warmed
(37 � 5�C), oxygenated (95% O2, 5% CO2) modified Krebs–
Henseleit
buffer

insulin).
Initially, the hearts were perfused using Langendorff’s
constant coronary pressure perfusion method. The post-
treatments Deltorphin D (1 mM, n ¼ 6) and cariporide
(3 mM, n ¼ 6) were supplemented to the buffer, whereas con-
trols had no treatment (n ¼ 6). If normal atrioventricular
electrical activity was not present upon reperfusion (e.g.
ventricular fibrillation (VF)), a 24–34 J defibrillation shock
was delivered via a coiled lead (SprintTM 6932, Medtronic,
Minneapolis, MN, USA) with the tip positioned in the apex
of the right ventricle; additional shocks were delivered until
occurrence of normal sinus rhythm. After 30 min of
Langendorff perfusion (stabilization period), the apparatus
was modified to allow the hearts to eject from the left
ventricles (working mode), by filling the left atriums via
preload filling chambers. The afterloads (mean aortic pres-
sures) were maintained at approximately 60 mmHg by
adjusting the height of a fluid column attached to the
aortic cannulas. Further details of the methods can be
reviewed in detail.31,32
Quantitative assessment of stunning and postischemic
dysfunction
Hemodynamic and pressure data were collected prior to
ischemia (in situ), at the initiation of working mode
(Tw ¼ 0 min), and for the subsequent 2 h, every 30 min.
Left ventricular pressures were measured using Mikro-Tip
catheter
transducers
(5 F,
Model
MPC-500,
Millar
Instruments, Inc., Houston, TX, USA). In vitro left atrial
and aortic pressures were measured via pressure trans-
ducers placed at the inlets of the left atriums (pulmonary
veins) and at the proximal ends of the descending aortas
distal to the occluded brachiocephalic arteries, respectively.
In addition, using 2 mm sonometric ultrasound crystals
(Sonometrics, London, Ontario) placed on the endpoints
of the two major axes of the left ventricles (four crystals
total), time-dependent changes in left ventricle volume par-
ameters were monitored (specifically, cardiac output and
ejection fraction). Preload independent parameters of left

 (EDPVR) and preload recruitable stroke work were mea-
sured by pressure–volume data collection during tempor-
ary occlusions of the inferior vena cavae or the pulmonary
veins. All data were acquired with the Sonosoft program
(Sonometrics) and postacquisition analyses were per-
formed using the Cardiosoft program (Sonometrics).
Reperfusion arrhythmia assessment
Reperfusion arrhythmias were quantified during the first
45 min of working mode perfusion. A lead II electrocardio-
gram configuration was employed to monitor arrhythmias
upon reperfusion in the isolated setting. Specifically elec-
trodes were placed in the water bath proximal to the super-
ior vena cava (Lead I), the left atrial appendage (Lead II),
and the apex (Lead III). The electrocardiograms were ampli-
fied and filtered with a Spacelabs monitoring system
(Model 1020, Spacelabs, Inc., Chatsworth, CA, USA) and
analyses were completed using the Ponemah Physiology
Platform Version 3.1 Program (Gould Instrument Systems,
Inc., Valley View, OH, USA). The following modified scor-
ing system was used to quantify arrhythmias: 0: <10 pre-
mature ventricular contractions (PVCs) in 9 min; 1: 10–50
PVCs in 9 min; 2: >50 PVCs in 9 min; 3: 1 episode of VF in
9 min; 4: 2–5 episodes of VF in 9 min; 5: >5 episodes of VF in
9 min.33,34
Microvascular damage and no-reflow assessment
For quantification of edema, tissue water contents were rec-
orded prior to reperfusion as a baseline and again 2 h after
working mode initiation by taking small (<100 mg) serial
biopsies from the right atrial appendage (findings in our
lab have indicated that serial left ventricular biopsies
are associated with frequent arrhythmias). Additionally,
regional myocardial blood flow was assessed with the use
of two different colored 15 mm microspheres (1.0 � 106 per
injection, E-Z TRAC Ultraspheres, Interactive Medical
Technologies, Irvine, CA, USA) injected into the left
atrium 15 min and 2 h after working mode start. After the
study was completed, each left ventricle was frozen and cut
into transverse 4 mm slices. Two transmural biopsies (�3 g)
were taken from the anterio-medial surface of the left ven-
tricle. Each segment was separated into three layers (�1 g
each) for blood flow analysis: subendocardial, midmyocar-
dial, and subepicardial. Routine tissue processing was com-
pleted (according to procedural instructions by Interactive
Medical Technologies) and tissue perfusion was calculated
using the formula
Flow ¼ Qb x Ct=Cb
where Qb is the reference flow (from descending aorta), Ct
is the number of microspheres in tissue normalized per
gram wet weight, and Cb is the number of microspheres
of the reference sample.
Metabolic status
Serial 1 mL perfusate samples were simultaneously taken
from the arterial (aorta) and venous coronary sinus
(6 F Venaport coronary sinus guiding catheter, Cardima,
Inc.,
Fremont,
CA,
USA)
for
metabolic
analysis
at
working mode initiation (Tw ¼ 0 min) and every 30 min
thereafter. Blood gas measurements (pCO2, pO2, and pH;
Instrumentation Laboratory 1640 BGE, Instrumentation
Laboratory, Lexington, MA, USA) as well as lactate levels
(Model
2300
Stat
Plus
Analyzer,
Yellow
Springs
Instruments, Yellow Springs, OH, USA) were quantified
and used for MVO2 and lactate efflux calculations. All
data were normalized to prereperfusion heart weights
(wet).
Necrosis assessment
Serial aliquots of perfusate (3 mL) were taken from the 6 F
catheter placed in the coronary sinus to analyze creatine
phosphokinase
(CK)
at
working
mode
initiation
(Tw ¼ 0 min) and every 30 min thereafter. All values were
normalized to prereperfusion heart weight (wet).
Protocol
Following 80 min of hypothermic (4�C) ischemia, the hearts
were reperfused on the isolated heart apparatus (Figure 1).
The reperfusion buffer was supplemented with the concen-
tration listed below. The buffer was recirculated in the
apparatus (through the coronary system) for 30 min in
the Langendorff mode, after which a complete buffer
change was accomplished and the hearts were made to
function in working mode. Three groups of animals were
used to study the effects of the delta opioid receptor agonist
therapy administered on reperfusion; hearts were treated
with either: (1) no reperfusion therapy (control, n ¼ 6), (2)
1 mM Deltorphin D (n ¼ 6), or (3) 3 mM cariporide (n ¼ 4).
Statistical analysis
Data are reported as mean � SEM. Data from all groups
were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA and
Fisher’s protected least significant difference (PLSD) test
as a post hoc test. One-way ANOVA analyses with Fisher’s
PLSD were used to determine differences between groups
at individual time points. All statistical analyses were com-
pleted using the Statview � 5.0.1 program (SAS Institute
Inc., Cary, NC, USA).
Results
Twenty-one experiments on isolated porcine hearts were
attempted. Four of ten (40%) control hearts and one of
seven (14%) Deltorphin D-treated hearts could not be tran-
sitioned into a sustained working mode due to insufficient
left ventricular pressure development (<50 mmHg) and
were subsequently excluded from the functional data ana-
lyses. Between groups of included animals, total body
weights (controls: 81 �1 kg, Deltorphin D: 82 � 6 kg, car-
iporide:
78 � 2 kg)
and
wet
heart
weights
(controls:
468 � 34 g, Deltorphin D: 431 � 26 g, cariporide: 442 � 23 g)
did not differ.

 Postischemic dysfunction
Hemodynamic differences between groups were most pro-
nounced immediately following working mode initiation
(30 min postreperfusion, Tw ¼ 0 min). Diastolic relaxation
was significantly improved (as evidenced by a decreased
diastolic relaxation time constant, Tau) in Deltorphin
D-treated
hearts
compared
to
controls
at
Tw ¼ 0 min
(Figure 2). Left ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP) was
decreased in the Deltorphin D-treated hearts at Tw ¼ 0 min
compared with controls (Table 1). Additionally, left ven-
tricular contractility (dP/dtmax) was significantly lower
relative
to
preischemic
values
at
Tw ¼ 0 min
in
the
Deltorphin D group. Both control- and cariporide-treated
hearts demonstrated decreased left ventricular diastolic
compliance (increased left ventricular EDPVR) throughout
the reperfusion period compared to baseline (preischemia)
and relative to the Deltorphin D group (Table 1). Finally,
lactate efflux as a measure of anaerobic metabolism
declined significantly over the perfusion period with
Deltorphin D treatment (Table 2).
Reperfusion arrhythmias
All hearts elicited VF upon reperfusion and required inter-
nal defibrillation. There were no significant differences
between groups in the number of defibrillatory shocks
needed to convert to normal sinus rhythm. As displayed
in
Figure
3,
compared
to
control
and
cariporide,
Deltorphin D-treated hearts presented with fewer arrhyth-
mias during the first 9 min of working mode and, therefore,
showed decreased reperfusion arrhythmia scores (Control:
1.3 � 0.2 versus Deltorphin D: 0.8 � 0.2, P < 0.1). Cariporide-
treated hearts demonstrated a significantly increased inci-
dence of PVCs and consequently higher arrhythmia scores
compared with Deltorphin D during the second arrhythmia
scoring period (10–18 min; P < 0.05).
Figure 1
Experimental Protocol. Hemodynamic data were collected prior to ischemia, at working mode transition, and every 30 min thereafter. In treated hearts,
Deltorphin D (1 mM) or cariporide (3 mM) was administered in the reperfusion buffer and circulated through the coronary system in Langendorff constant pressure
retrograde perfusion for 30 min (stabilization period). Working mode transition occurred 30 min after reperfusion, just after opioid washout. Water content samples via
right atrial biopsies were taken at baseline, prior to reperfusion, and 2 h postreperfusion. Arrhythmias were monitored during the first 45 min of working mode. Regional
myocardial perfusion was assessed via colored microspheres 15 min (Tw ¼ 15 min) after working mode transition and at Tw ¼ 120 min
Figure 2
Opioid effects on postischemic diastolic relaxation. Postischemic
diastolic relaxation was impaired relative to baseline (preischemia) in all groups,
as evidenced by significantly increased diastolic relaxation time constants (Tau).
However, Tau was significantly lower in Deltorphin D-treated hearts during early
reperfusion (Tw ¼ 0 min) compared to controls, indicating improved relaxation
with delta opioid treatment. *P < 0.05 versus preischemia (baseline); yP < 0.05

 Microvascular damage
Edema development (i.e. water content) at Tw ¼ 120 min
was not statistically different between groups (%H2O:
control ¼ 66 � 3%; Deltorphin D ¼ 57 � 6%; cariporide ¼
67 � 4%). Tissue perfusion data collected over the reperfu-
sion period via serial colored microsphere injections are
shown in Figure 4. Comparisons were only made between
control- and Deltorphin D-treated hearts (n ¼ 4 each), as
these data were not collected in cariporide-treated hearts.
Control hearts showed minimal change in perfusion of the
subendocardial, midmyocardial, and subepicardial layers
over the perfusion period. Conversely, Deltorphin D-trea-
ted hearts showed increased tissue perfusion compared to
controls at Tw ¼ 120 min, which was significant in the mid-
myocardial layer (P < 0.05).
Necrosis
At the initiation of working mode (Tw ¼ 0 min) there was a
trend of increased creatine kinase activity in the perfusate
from controls; however, there was no significant difference
between groups (control: 0.16 � 0.13 versus Deltorphin D:
0.08 � 0.08 IU/L/g; Figure 5). Additionally, hearts in both
groups elicited similar levels of creatine kinase activity in
the perfusate during the first hour of reperfusion and there-
after. Creatine kinase activity in the perfusate collected from
cariporide-treated hearts was not detectable with spectro-
photometric analysis (<20 IU/L/g).
Discussion
In the present study, we demonstrated that the postischemic
administration of Deltorphin D, a specific delta 2 opioid
agonist, during the initial reperfusion period significantly
attenuated subsequent reperfusion injury in isolated work-
ing porcine hearts. While Deltorphin D supplemented to
the reperfusion buffer initially transiently decreased sys-
tolic LVSP and contractility (dP/dtmax) compared to control
hearts, subsequently there were no differences in sys-
tolic
performance

groups.

Opioid effects on postischemic myocardial tissue perfusion. Regional myocardial perfusion of the anterior left ventricular wall was assessed using colored
microsphere injections at 15 and 120 min after working mode initiation (Tw ¼ 0). Transmural biopsies were taken from the myocardium at experiment termination and
separated into three layers: (a) subendocardial, (b) midmyocardial, and (c) subepicardial. Flows were normalized per gram of tissue. Preliminary evidence of the no-
reflow phenomenon was seen at the Tw ¼ 120 time point, as all control hearts showed declining trends in flow to all layers of the heart. This trend was not present in the
Deltorphin D-treated hearts and a significant increase in flow at Tw ¼ 120 was found in the midmyocardial level. *P < 0.05 versus control

Opioid effects on ventricular arrhythmias during reperfusion. Shown
is a comparison of ventricular arrhythmia scores during the first 45 min of working
mode perfusion. Quantification of arrhythmias using a scoring system (scored
every 9 min) showed a decrease in relative arrhythmia occurrence with Deltorphin
D during the early periods of working mode perfusion compared to the cariporide
group. While mean arrhythmia scores were lower in the Deltorphin D-treated
hearts compared to controls during the first 9 min of working mode, this differ-
ence was not significant (P ¼ 0.1). *P < 0.05 versus cariporide

 Deltorphin D treatment was associated with enhanced left
ventricular diastolic compliance (left ventricular EDPVR)
and relaxation (Tau). Furthermore, Deltorphin D also pre-
vented decreases in tissue perfusion (no-reflow phenom-
enon)
over
time
and
decreased
reperfusion-induced
arrhythmias. The administration of cariporide, a NHE
blocker, upon reperfusion failed to demonstrate any func-
tional benefits and increased the incidence of reperfusion
arrhythmias. Interestingly, necrosis determination showed
no detection of CK, which could indicate less necrosis
development in comparison to the Deltorphin D and
control groups. This finding might offset cariporide’s
aforementioned
negative
effects
during
reperfusion.
Nevertheless, these results collectively show, for the first
time, that delta opioid postconditioning is effective in
attenuating
dysfunction
during
the
early
reperfusion
period.
As in the current study, similar protocols with other
known pharmacological preconditioning agents such as
adenosine, bradykinin, and isoflurane have been shown
to mitigate reperfusion injury. For example, the selective
A1/A2 agonist AMP 579 has been proved to attenuate reper-
fusion injury (reduce infarct size) in swine when adminis-
tered either prior to ischemia (preconditioning) or during
the early reperfusion period.35 Similarly, in the globally
ischemic and reperfused isolated rabbit hearts, administra-
tion of AMP 579 at reperfusion decreased infarct size and
reduced postischemic contracture.22 In addition to those
studies, Ke et al.36 found that postconditioning with adeno-
sine also inhibited inflammation by dropping myocardial
NF-kB and TNF-a expression significantly in the rat myo-
cardium. Furthermore, administration of different mu
opioid receptor selective drugs (e.g. remifentanil, fentanyl,
butorphanol, etc.) has elicited attenuations in reperfusion
injury as postconditioning agents.11,14,37–39 Lastly, it was
reported that the addition of DADLE, a delta and mu
opioid agonist, to the reperfusion buffer of a postischemic
isolated rat heart prevented the development of ventricular
arrhythmias. However, it should be noted that specific
blockade of the mu opioid receptor abolished this effect.40
Previous
work
from
our
laboratory
demonstrated
that preconditioning with the delta 2-specific agonist,
Deltorphin D, significantly decreased infarct size in a por-
cine coronary occlusion model while kappa opioid receptor
co-activation during preconditioning exacerbated the ische-
mic insult.10,41 In addition to its infarct limiting ability,
Deltorphin D preconditioning was also associated with
decreased LVSP and contractility (dP/dtmax) during ische-
mia and early reperfusion compared with controls. Similar
to our preconditioning studies, in the present study post-
conditioning with Deltorphin D decreased systolic per-
formance (LVSP and dP/dtmax) compared to controls
during the early reperfusion period. Of additional interest,
isolated rat hearts preconditioned with DPDPE, a delta
1-specific opioid agonist, also demonstrated decreased
reperfusion-induced ventricular arrhythmias with con-
tractile
dysfunction
(negative
inotropic
effect)
upon
reperfusion.42
As was found with adenosine,43 Deltorphin D adminis-
tration attenuated the no-reflow phenomenon exhibiting a
significant increase in coronary flow in the midmyocardial
layer at the 2 h reperfusion time point. The no-reflow phe-
nomenon is a multifactorial syndrome that is potentially
caused by leukocyte-mediated endothelial damage; how-
ever, it may also present as a secondary consequence of
myocyte edema and contracture.1,44 In the leukocyte-free
crystalloid perfused heart employed in the present study,
we found early evidence of the no-reflow phenomenon in
control hearts only (i.e. trends of decreased myocardial per-
fusion over time). The Deltorphin D post-treated hearts also

 elicited trends for decreased edema development and sig-
nificantly improved diastolic performance during the
reperfusion period, possibly implicating attenuation of
microvascular damage via this secondary mechanism.
While we did not find a decrease in necrosis (creatine
kinase efflux) with Deltorphin D administration during
reperfusion compared to controls, it should be noted that
the severity of the ischemia stimulus is considerably less in
a hypothermic globally ischemic model compared to a nor-
mothermic coronary occlusion model. Also of interest, in a
previous study from our laboratory using the same isolated
porcine model of global ischemia, we did not find a reduc-
tion in necrosis but rather improved hemodynamic per-
formance with morphine or DADLE preconditioning of
isolated porcine hearts.32 It should be noted that reperfu-
sion injury is a multifaceted phenomenon and lack of pro-
tection against reperfusion-induced necrosis does not
necessarily preclude that reperfusion injury was not
attenuated.
The underlying mechanisms of ischemic postcondition-
ing are considered to be multifactorial and involve cell-sur-
face receptor activation, survival signaling pathways, and
mitochondria as the end effectors. Calcium is known to play
an important role in the pathophysiology of reperfusion
injury, as reperfusion-induced calcium overload is one of
the primary instigators of myocardial stunning, reperfusion
arrhythmias, and necrosis.1,29,38,45–48 The data collected in
this study lead us to speculate that opioid administration on
reperfusion may alter sarcolemmal or mitochondrial cal-
cium fluxes. In an additional attempt to elucidate the role
of sarcolemmal calcium influx on reperfusion injury in our
isolated heart model, we administered the NHE blocker,
cariporide, during the reperfusion period. It has been
shown in previous studies that cariporide secondarily pre-
vents calcium overload by attenuating sodium influx and
subsequently preventing sarcolemmal calcium overload
upon reperfusion.49 Many investigators have demonstrated
that administration of NHE blockers prior to ischemia
limits the extent of ischemia–reperfusion injury. However,
when this therapy was administered during the early reper-
fusion period, there were conflicting opinions as to the
benefits. While we found similar trends of decreased
LVSP with either cariporide or Deltorphin D administra-
tion, which may be due to decreased intracellular calcium
during systole, there were no marked benefits of cariporide
treatment. Furthermore, cariporide administration in this
model produced a pro-arrhythmogenic effect during the
early reperfusion period compared to Deltorphin D and
controls (Figure 3). Hence, it may be speculated that in
this isolated heart model, decreased sarcolemmal calcium
influx alone does not have a significant effect on reperfu-
sion injury.
It
is
generally
accepted
that
endogenous
opioid
ligands are involved in the process of ischemic pre- and
postconditioning, making the opioid receptor system a
logical drug target to achieve similar effects. The opioid
receptor is composed of seven transmembrane domains
and belongs to the class A family of G protein-coupled
receptors. These are involved in cardiac stress signaling
and cardioprotection by activation of PI3K/Akt and RISK
pathway components.14
Delta opioid-induced cardioprotection during reperfu-
sion may be due, in part, to opening of sarcolemmal and
mitochondrial KATP channels, subsequently preventing
mitochondrial Ca2þ overload during reperfusion and thus
preserving postischemic mitochondrial energy production
(i.e. decreased lactate production) and enhancing diastolic
relaxation.11,50
The no-flow phenomenon was lessened in patients when
the KATP channel opener, nicorandil, a coronary vasodilator
and pharmacological preconditioning agent, was adminis-
tered as an adjunct to reperfusion therapy.51 Similarly,
results from the IONA Study Group52 and CESAR53 clinical
trials demonstrated that nicorandil, when given to patients
with unstable angina, decreased cardiovascular events
associated with ischemia, including a decreased incidence
of arrhythmias. Murata et al.54 reported that opening of the
MPT during reperfusion, secondary to cytosolic and mito-
chondrial calcium overload, may be primarily responsible
for reperfusion-induced cellular death. They also showed
that MPT opening is a reperfusion-specific phenomenon
that does not occur during ischemia and that diazoxide, a
mitochondrial KATP channel opener, attenuates mitochon-
drial Ca2þ loading and, consequently, MPT opening during
reperfusion.54 Collectively, these results lead us to assume
that opioid-induced cardioprotection during reperfusion
may be due partly to opening of mitochondrial KATP chan-
nels, and subsequently preventing mitochondrial Ca2þ over-
load during reperfusion, thus preserving postischemic
mitochondrial energy production (i.e. decreased lactate pro-
duction) and enhancing diastolic relaxation. Furthermore,
decreased calcium influx with Deltorphin D treatment
would also explain the observed decrease in systolic per-
formance during the early reperfusion period found in
both the preconditioning and present studies.
Despite the fact that Deltorphin D administration did not
completely ameliorate ischemia–reperfusion injury in the
present study, altering the dose and timing of administration
may prove more successful. The dose employed in our study
was chosen based on preliminary preconditioning studies in
an acute coronary occlusion model10 and in vitro isolated
muscle bath preparations (unpublished data). Whereas bene-
fits were observed in these models, due to the novel design of
this study, direct extrapolation of these results to administra-
tion upon reperfusion was not possible. Additionally, since
the Tw ¼ 0 min data collection time point appeared to show
the most functional benefit of opioid administration, it may
be of greater benefit to increase the timing of administration
on reperfusion.
This pharmacological approach has its clinical applica-
tion as an addition to thrombolysis medication and during
coronary angioplasty procedures. In this setting, the drug
could be administered early and allow time to actually cir-
culate through the body until onset of coronary reflow.29
Also myocardial ischemia and reperfusion injury both
negatively affect the outcome of cardiac transplantation.
With advances in normothermic ex vivo organ perfusion,
pharmacological postconditioning is gaining a new dimen-
sion and importance. The discovery of drugs that effectively

 attenuate reperfusion injury and better maintain cardiac
function on the device, or even induce functional recovery,
is relevant.
In this study, we utilized a large mammalian porcine
model, in comparison to small animals and rodents that
were mostly used in the past for postconditioning stu-
dies.37,55 The pig serves as an appropriate acute surgical,
transplantation, and ischemia model presenting with similar
anatomic and physiologic characteristics to humans for this
experimental setup, making this research translational.56,57
We conclude that the investigation of this specific delta
opioid as a postconditioning agent in the porcine model
may confer clinical relevance in minimizing reperfusion
injury associated with coronary stenting or bypass surgery,
myocardial infarction, or cardiac transplantation. Further
additional reperfusion studies on heart preservation systems
utilizing the specific delta opioid would be revealing.
