Implicit bias in healthcare professionals:
a systematic review
Chloë FitzGerald* and Samia Hurst
Abstract
Background: Implicit biases involve associations outside conscious awareness that lead to a negative evaluation of
a person on the basis of irrelevant characteristics such as race or gender. This review examines the evidence that
healthcare professionals display implicit biases towards patients.
Methods: PubMed, PsychINFO, PsychARTICLE and CINAHL were searched for peer-reviewed articles published
between 1st March 2003 and 31st March 2013. Two reviewers assessed the eligibility of the identified papers based on
precise content and quality criteria. The references of eligible papers were examined to identify further eligible studies.
Results: Forty two articles were identified as eligible. Seventeen used an implicit measure (Implicit Association Test
in fifteen and subliminal priming in two), to test the biases of healthcare professionals. Twenty five articles
employed a between-subjects design, using vignettes to examine the influence of patient characteristics on
healthcare professionals’ attitudes, diagnoses, and treatment decisions. The second method was included
although it does not isolate implicit attitudes because it is recognised by psychologists who specialise in implicit
cognition as a way of detecting the possible presence of implicit bias. Twenty seven studies examined racial/
ethnic biases; ten other biases were investigated, including gender, age and weight. Thirty five articles found
evidence of implicit bias in healthcare professionals; all the studies that investigated correlations found a significant
positive relationship between level of implicit bias and lower quality of care.
Discussion: The evidence indicates that healthcare professionals exhibit the same levels of implicit bias as the wider
population. The interactions between multiple patient characteristics and between healthcare professional and patient
characteristics reveal the complexity of the phenomenon of implicit bias and its influence on clinician-patient
interaction. The most convincing studies from our review are those that combine the IAT and a method measuring the
quality of treatment in the actual world. Correlational evidence indicates that biases are likely to influence diagnosis
and treatment decisions and levels of care in some circumstances and need to be further investigated. Our review also
indicates that there may sometimes be a gap between the norm of impartiality and the extent to which it is embraced
by healthcare professionals for some of the tested characteristics.
Conclusions: Our findings highlight the need for the healthcare profession to address the role of implicit biases in
disparities in healthcare. More research in actual care settings and a greater homogeneity in methods employed to test
implicit biases in healthcare is needed.

 Background
A patient should not expect to receive a lower standard
of care because of her race, age or any other irrelevant
characteristic. However, implicit associations (uncon-
scious, uncontrollable, or arational processes) may influ-
ence our judgements resulting in bias. Implicit biases
occur between a group or category attribute, such as being
black, and a negative evaluation (implicit prejudice) or
another category attribute, such as being violent (implicit
stereotype) [1].1 In addition to affecting judgements, im-
plicit biases manifest in our non-verbal behaviour to-
wards others, such as frequency of eye contact and
physical proximity. Implicit biases explain a potential
dissociation between what a person explicitly believes
and wants to do (e.g. treat everyone equally) and the
hidden influence of negative implicit associations on
her thoughts and action (e.g. perceiving a black patient
as less competent and thus deciding not to prescribe
the patient a medication).
The term ‘bias’ is typically used to refer to both implicit
stereotypes and prejudices and raises serious concerns in
healthcare. Psychologists often define bias broadly; such as
‘the negative evaluation of one group and its members
relative to another’ [2]. Another way to define bias is to
stipulate that an implicit association represents a bias
only when likely to have a negative impact on an
already disadvantaged group; e.g. if someone associates
young girls with dolls, this would count as a bias. It is
not itself a negative evaluation, but it supports an image
of femininity that may prevent girls from excelling in areas
traditionally considered ‘masculine’ such as mathematics
[3]. Another option is to stipulate that biases are not
inherently bad, but only to be avoided when they incline
us away from the truth [4].
In healthcare, we need to think carefully about exactly
what is meant by bias. To fulfil the goal of delivering
impartial care, healthcare professionals should be wary
of any kind of negative evaluation they make that is
linked to membership of a group or to a particular char-
acteristic. The psychologists’ definition of bias thus may
be adequate for the case of implicit prejudice; there are
unlikely, in the context of healthcare, to be any justified
reasons for negative evaluations related to group mem-
bership. The case of implicit stereotypes differs slightly
because stereotypes can be damaging even when they
are not negative per se. At least at a theoretical level,
there is a difference between an implicit stereotype that
leads to a distorted judgement and a legitimate associ-
ation that correctly tracks real world statistical informa-
tion. Here, the other definitions of bias presented above
may prove more useful.
The majority of people tested from all over the world
and within a wide range of demographics show re-
sponses
to
the
most
widely
used
test
of
implicit
attitudes, the Implicit Association Test (IAT), that indi-
cate a level of implicit anti-black bias [5]. Other biases
tested include gender, ethnicity, nationality and sexual
orientation; there is evidence that these implicit attitudes
are widespread among the population worldwide and
influence behaviour outside the laboratory [6, 7]. For
instance, one widely cited study found that simply chan-
ging names from white-sounding ones to black-sounding
ones on CVs in the US had a negative effect on callbacks
[8]. Implicit bias was suspected to be the culprit, and a
replication of the study in Sweden, using Arab-sounding
names instead of Swedish-sounding names, did in fact
find a correlation between the HR professionals who
preferred the CVs with Swedish-sounding names and a
higher level of implicit bias towards Arabs [9].
We may consciously reject negative images and ideas
associated with disadvantaged groups (and may belong
to these groups ourselves), but we have all been
immersed in cultures where these groups are constantly
depicted in stereotyped and pejorative ways. Hence the
description of ‘aversive racists’: those who explicitly
reject racist ideas, but who are found to have implicit
race bias when they take a race IAT [10]. Although there
is currently a lack of understanding of the exact mech-
anism by which cultural immersion translates into impli-
cit stereotypes and prejudices, the widespread presence
of these biases in egalitarian-minded individuals suggests
that culture has more influence than many previously
thought.
The implicit biases of concern to health care profes-
sionals are those that operate to the disadvantage of
those who are already vulnerable. Examples include
minority ethnic populations, immigrants, the poor, low
health-literacy individuals, sexual minorities, children,
women, the elderly, the mentally ill, the overweight and
the disabled, but anyone may be rendered vulnerable
given a certain context [11]. The vulnerable in health-
care are typically members of groups who are already
disadvantaged on many levels. Work in political philoso-
phy, such as the De-Shalit and Wolff concept of ‘corro-
sive disadvantage’
, a disadvantage that is likely to lead to
further disadvantages, is relevant here [12]. For instance,
if a person is poor and constantly worried about making
ends meet, this is a disadvantage in itself, but can be cor-
rosive when it leads to further disadvantages. In a coun-
try such as Switzerland, where private health insurance
is mandatory and yearly premiums can be lowered by in-
creasing the deductible, a high deductible may lead such
a person to refrain from visiting a physician because of
the potential cost incurred. This, in turn, could mean
that the diagnosis of a serious illness is delayed leading
to poorer health. In this case, being poor is a corrosive
disadvantage because it leads to a further disadvantage
of poor health.

 The presence of implicit biases among healthcare pro-
fessionals and the effect on quality of clinical care is a
cause for concern [13–15]. In the US, racial healthcare
disparities are widely documented and implicit race bias
is one possible cause. Two excellent literature reviews
on the issue of implicit bias in healthcare have recently
been published [16, 17]. One is a narrative review that
selects the most significant recent studies to provide a
helpful overall picture of the current state of the re-
search in healthcare on implicit bias [16]. The other is a
systematic review that focusses solely on racial bias and
thus captures only studies conducted in the US, where
race is the most prominent issue [17]. Our review differs
from the first because it poses a specific question, is sys-
tematic in its collection of studies, and includes an
examination of studies solely employing the vignette
method. Its systematic method lends weight to the
evidence it provides and its inclusion of the vignette
method enables it to compare two different literatures
on bias in healthcare. It differs from the second because
it includes all types of bias, not only racial; partly as a
consequence, it captures many studies conducted out-
side the US. It is important to include studies conducted
in non-US countries because race understood as white/
black is not the source of the most potentially harmful
stereotypes and disparities in all cultural contexts. For
example, a recent vignette study in Switzerland found
that in the German-speaking part of the country, physi-
cians displayed negative bias in treatment decisions
towards fictional Serbian patients (skin colour was un-
specified, but it would typically be assumed to be white),
but no significant negative bias towards fictional patients
from Ghana (skin colour would be assumed to be black)
[18]. In the Swiss German context, the issue of skin
colour may thus be less significant for potential bias
than that of country of origin.2
Methods
Data sources and search strategy
Our research question was: do trained healthcare profes-
sionals display implicit biases towards certain types of
patient? PubMed (Medline), PsychINFO, PsychARTICLE
and CINAHL were searched for peer-reviewed articles
published between 1st March 2003 and 31st March 2013.
When we performed exploratory searches on PubMed be-
fore conducting the final search, we noticed that in 2003
there was a sharp increase in the number of articles on
implicit bias and so we decided to begin from this year.
The final searches were conducted on the 31st March
2013. We used a combination of subject headings and free
text terms that related to the attitudes of healthcare
professionals (e.g. “physician-patient relations”, “atti-
tude of health personnel”), implicit biases (e.g. “prejudice”,
“stereotyping”, “unconscious bias”), particular kinds of
discrimination
(e.g.
“aversive
racism”,
anti-fat
bias”,
“women’s health”), and healthcare disparities (e.g. “health
status disparities”, “delivery of health care”) which were
combined with the Boolean operators “AND” and “OR”.
Study selection
3767 titles were retrieved and independently screened by
the two reviewers (SH and CF). The titles that were
agreed by both after discussion to be ineligible according
to our inclusion criteria were discarded (3498) and the
abstracts of the remaining articles (269) were independ-
ently screened by both reviewers. Abstracts that were
agreed by both reviewers to be ineligible according to
our inclusion criteria were discarded (241). When the in-
eligible abstracts were discarded, the remaining 28 arti-
cles were read and independently rated by us both. Out
of these, 27 articles were agreed after discussion to merit
inclusion in the final selection. One article was excluded
at this stage because it did not fit our inclusion criteria
(it did not employ the assumption method or an implicit
measure). Additionally, the reference lists of these 27
articles were manually scanned by CF, and the full text
articles resulting from this were independently read by
both reviewers, resulting in the inclusion of a further 11
articles that both reviewers agreed fitted the inclusion
criteria. After a repeat process of scanning the reference
lists of the 11 articles from the second round, the final
number of eligible articles was 42. All disagreements
were resolved through discussion.
The inclusion criteria were:
1. Empirical study.
2. A method identifying implicit rather than explicit
biases.
3. Participants were physicians or nurses who had
completed their studies.
4. Written in English or another language spoken by
CF or SH (CF: French, Italian, Spanish, Catalan; SH:
French, Italian, German).
There is no clear consensus on the meaning of the
term ‘implicit’. The term is used in psychology to refer
to a feature or features of a mental process. We chose a
wide negative definition of implicit processes, assuming
that implicit social cognition is involved in the absence
of any of the four features that characterise explicit cog-
nition: intention, conscious availability, controllability,
and the need for mental resources. This absence does
not rule out the involvement of explicit processes, but
indicates the presence of implicit processes. While
most institutional policies against bias focus on explicit
cognition, research on implicit bias shows that this is
mistaken [6].

 There is broad agreement in psychology that methods
known as ‘implicit measures’
, including the affective
priming task, the IAT and the affective Simon task,
reveal implicit attitudes [19]. We included articles using
these measures. We also included studies that employed
a method popular in bioethics literature that we label
‘the assumption method’. It involves measuring differ-
ences across participants in response to clinical vignettes,
identical except for one feature, such as the race, of the
character in the vignette. There is no direct measure of
the implicitness or non-explicitness of the processes at
work in participants; instead, there is an assumption that
the majority are explicitly motivated to disregard factors
such as race. If there is a statistically significant difference
in the diagnosis or treatment prescribed correlated with –
for example- the race of the patient, the researchers infer
that it is partly a result of implicit processes in the phy-
sicians’ decision-making. The assumption method of
measuring implicit bias has been used in a variety of
naturalistic contexts where it is harder to bring subjects
into the laboratory. It is recognised by psychologists who
specialise in implicit cognition as a way of detecting the
possible presence of implicit bias, if not as an implicit
measure in itself [6].
Studies that used self-report questionnaires were not
included because, although they can use subtle methods
to estimate a subject’s attitudes, they are typically used
in psychology as a measure of explicit mental processes.
There are potential problems with the implicit/explicit
distinction as applied to psychological measures and it
may be preferable in future research to speak of ‘direct’
and ‘indirect’ measures, but for the purposes of the
review we followed this convention in psychology. The
original idea behind implicit measures was that they
attempted to measure something other than explicit
mental processes, whereas self-report questionnaires ask
a subject direct questions and thus prompt a chain of
explicit conscious reasoning in the subject.
Data extraction
Data were extracted by CF and reviewed by SH for ac-
curacy and completeness. All disagreements with the
information extracted were resolved through discussion.
We contacted the corresponding author of an article to
obtain information that was not available in the pub-
lished manuscript that related to the nature of the pres-
entation given to recruit participants, but received no
response.
Results
Identified studies
The eligible studies are described in Table 1 and their
main characteristics are outlined in Table 2. The most fre-
quently examined biases were racial/ethnic and gender,
but ten other biases were investigated (Table 2). Four of
the assumption studies compared results from two or
more countries to explore effects of differences in health-
care systems.
The 14 assumption method studies examining mul-
tiple biases investigated interactions between biases.
They recorded the socio-demographic characteristics of
the participants to reveal complex interactions between
physician characteristics and the characteristics of the
imaginary ‘patient’ in the vignette.
All IAT studies measured implicit prejudice; five also
measured implicit stereotypes. When implicit prejudice
is measured, words or images from one category are
matched with positive or negative words (e.g., black
faces with ‘pleasant’). When implicit stereotypes are
measured, words or images from one category are
matched with words from a conceptual category (e.g. fe-
male faces and ‘home’).
Nine IAT studies combined the IAT with a measure
of physician behaviour or treatment decision to see if
there were correlations between these and levels of im-
plicit bias.
The subliminal priming studies were dissimilar: one
was an exploratory study to see if certain diseases were
stereotypically associated with African Americans, using
faces as primes and reaction times to the names of dis-
eases as the measure of implicit association; the other
study used race words as primes and tested the effect of
time pressure on responses to a clinical vignette.
A variety of media were used for the clinical vignette
and the method of questioning participants within the
assumption method. One unusual study used simula-
tions of actual encounters with patients, hiring actors
and using a set for the physicians to role-play. Physi-
cians’ treatment decisions were recorded by observers,
and the physician recorded his own diagnosis, prognosis
and perceptions after the encounter.
Limitations
Of specific studies
Limitations are detailed in Table 3. Some studies failed to
report response rates, or to provide full information on
statistical methods or participant characteristics. Some
had very small sample sizes and the majority did not men-
tion calculating the power of their sample. Some authors
explicitly informed participants of the purpose of the
study, or gave participants questionnaires or other tests
that indicated the subject of the study before presenting
them with the vignette. For optimal results, participants
should not be alerted to the particular patient charac-
teristic(s) under study, particularly in an assumption
study where knowing the characteristic(s) may influ-
ence the interpretation of the vignette. In IAT studies,

 this is less worrying because IAT effects are to some
extent uncontrollable.
Of the field
Implicit bias in healthcare is an emerging field of research
with no established methodology. This is to be expected
and is not a problem in itself, but it does present an obs-
tacle when conducting a review of this kind. The range of
methods used and the variety of journals with differing
standards and protocols for describing experiments made
it difficult to compare the results. In addition, authors fo-
cusing on a particular bias (e.g. gender), often in combin-
ation with a particular health issue (e.g. heart disease),
frequently did not appear to be familiar with one another’s
research. This lack of familiarity meant that often used dif-
ferent terms to describe the same phenomenon, which
also made conducting the review more difficult.
Few of the existing results can be described as ‘real
world’ treatment outcomes. The two priming studies
involved very small samples and were more exploratory
than result-seeking [20, 21]. The IAT and assumption
studies were conducted under laboratory conditions.
The only three studies conducted in naturalistic settings
combined the IAT with measures of physician-patient
interaction [22–24]. However, many of the assumption
studies attempted to make their vignettes as realistic as
possible by having them validated by clinicians [25–41]
and also by having participants view/read the vignettes
as part of a normal day at work [27–36, 39, 41].
Because the studies of interest used psychological
techniques, but were mainly to be found in a medical
database (PubMed), the classification of the studies was
not always optimal. There is no heading in Medline for
‘implicit bias’ and studies using similar methods were
sometimes categorized under different subject headings,

which increased the risk of missing eligible studies.
Existence of implicit biases/stereotypes in healthcare
professionals and influence on quality of care
Healthcare professionals have implicit biases
Almost all studies found evidence for implicit biases
among physicians and nurses. Based on the available evi-
dence, physicians and nurses manifest implicit biases to
a similar degree as the general population. The following
characteristics are at issue: race/ethnicity, gender, socio-
economic status (SES), age, mental illness, weight, having
AIDS, brain injured patients perceived to have contributed
to their injury,3 intravenous drug users, disability, and
social circumstances.
Of the seven studies that did not find evidence of bias,
one compared the mentally ill with another potentially
unfavourable category, welfare recipients; this study did
find a positive correlation between levels of implicit bias
and over-diagnosis of the mentally ill patient in the
vignette [42]. Another used simulated interactions with
actors, which may result in participants being on ‘best
behaviour’ in the role-play [41]. The two studies that re-
ported no evidence of bias in diagnosis of depression
found that physicians’ estimates of SES were influenced
by race (lower SES estimated for black patients); [37, 38]
one reported that estimates of SES in turn were signifi-
cantly related to estimates of patient demeanour (lower
SES associated with hostile patient demeanour) [37]. A
further study failed to find differences due to patient
race in the prescription of opioids, but found an inter-
action whereby black patients who exhibited ‘challen-
ging’ behaviour (such as belligerence and asking for a
specific opioid) were more likely to be prescribed opioids
than those who did not, an effect possibly due to a racial
stereotype [43]. Another study that failed to find implicit
race bias suggested that this was due to the setting of
the study in an inner-city clinic with high levels of black
patients and the fact that many physicians were born
outside the US [24]. Finally, one study that found no evi-
dence of racial bias in prescription of opioid analgesics
presented each participant with three vignettes depicting
patients of three different ethnicities, thus probably
alerting them to the objective of the study [40].
The interaction effects between different patient char-
acteristics in assumption studies are varied and a few are
surprising. The authors of one study expected that phy-
sicians would be less likely to prescribe a higher dose of
opioids to black patients who exhibited challenging be-
haviours; in fact, physicians were more likely to pre-
scribe higher doses of opioids to challenging black
patients, yet slightly less likely to do so to white patients
exhibiting the same behaviour. Sometimes significant
effects on the responses to the vignette of a patient char-
acteristic, e.g. race, are only found when the interaction
between gender and race or SES and race is examined.
For example, physicians in one study were less certain of
the diagnosis of coronary heart disease for middle-aged
women, who were thus twice as likely to receive a men-
tal health diagnosis than their male counterparts [34]. In
another, low SES Latinas and blacks were more likely to
have intrauterine contraception recommended than low
SES whites, but there was no effect of race for high SES
patients [39].
Implicit bias affects clinical judgement and behaviour
Three studies found a significant correlation between
high levels of physicians’ implicit bias against blacks on
IAT scores and interaction that was negatively rated by
black patients [23, 24, 44] and, in one study, also nega-
tively rated by external observers [23]. Four studies
examining the correlation between IAT scores and
responses to clinical vignettes found a significant correl-
ation between high levels of pro-white implicit bias and
treatment responses that favoured patients specified as
white [42, 45–47]. In one study, implicit prejudice of
nurses towards injecting drug users significantly mediated
the relationship between job stress and their intention to
change jobs [48].
Twenty out of 25 assumption studies found that some
kind of bias was evident either in the diagnosis, the
treatment recommendations, the number of questions
asked of the patient, the number of tests ordered, or
other responses indicating bias against the characteristic
of the patient under examination.
Determinants of bias
Socio-demographic
characteristics
of
physicians
and
nurses (e.g. gender, race, type of healthcare setting, years
of experience, country where medical training received)
are correlated with level of bias. In one study, male staff
were significantly less sympathetic and more frustrated
than female staff with self-harming patients presenting
in A&E [26]. Black patients in the US –but not the UK-
were significantly more likely to be questioned about
smoking than white [28]. In another study, international
medical graduates rated the African-American male
patient in the vignette as being of significantly lower
SES than did US graduates [38]. One study found that
paediatricians held less implicit race bias compared
with other MDs [47].
Correlations between explicit and implicit attitudes
varied depending on the type of bias and on the kind of
explicit questions asked. For instance, implicit anti-fat
bias tends to correlate more with an explicit anti-fat bias
than racial bias, where explicit and implicit attitudes
often diverge significantly. Because physicians’ and nurses’
FitzGerald and Hurst BMC Medical Ethics  (2017) 18:19 
Page 13 of 18
 implicit attitudes diverged frequently from their expli-
cit attitudes, explicit measures cannot be used alone
to measure the presence of bias among healthcare
professionals.
Discussion
A variety of studies, conducted in various countries, using
different methods, and testing different patient character-
istics, found evidence of implicit biases among healthcare
professionals and a negative correlation exists between
level of implicit bias and indicators of quality of care. The
two most common methods employed were the assump-
tion method and the IAT, the latter sometimes combined
with another measure to test for correlations with the be-
haviour of healthcare professionals.
Our study has several limitations. Four studies in-
cluded participants who were not trained physicians or
nurses and failed to report separate results for these
categories of participants [42, 44, 49, 50]. Since either
the majority of participants were qualified physicians
and nurses, or were other health care professionals in-
volved in patient care, we included these studies despite
this limitation. Excluding them would not have changed
the conclusions of this paper. In addition, we initially
centred our research on studies employing implicit mea-
sures recognised in psychology, but the majority of the
included studies in the final review used the assumption
method. However, the limitations imposed by the lack of
consistency in keywords and categorization of articles
actually worked in our favour here, enabling us to cap-
ture a variety of methods and thus to consider including
the assumption method. Scanning the references of the
articles that were initially retained and repeating this
process until there were no new articles helped us to
capture further pertinent articles. From the degree of
cross-referencing we are confident that we succeeded in
identifying most of the relevant articles using the
assumption method.
Publication bias could limit the availability of results
that reveal little or no implicit bias among healthcare
professionals. Moreover, eight articles appeared to refer
to the same data collected in a single cross-country
comparison study [27–32, 34, 35] and a further two
articles analysed the same data [45, 47]. The sum of 42
articles thus can give the impression that more research
has been carried out on more participants than is the
case. The solidity of data revealing high levels of implicit
bias among the general population suggest that this is
unlikely to have invalidated the conclusion that implicit
bias is present in healthcare professionals [6, 7].
However, our decision to exclude studies that involved
students rather than fully-trained healthcare profes-
sionals meant that we did not include a study conducted
on medical students that showed no significant association
between implicit bias and clinical assessments [51].
Several studies post 2013 (thus after our cut-off date)
have also indicated a null relationship between levels of
implicit bias and clinical decision-making [52–54]. The
scientific community working in this area agrees that
the relationship between levels of implicit bias in
healthcare professionals and clinical decision-making is
complex and that there is currently a lack of good evi-
dence for a direct negative influence of biases [16, 17].
As our review shows, there is clearer evidence for a
relationship between implicit bias and negative effects
on clinical interaction [23, 24, 44]. While this may not
always translate into negative treatment outcomes, the
relationship between a healthcare professional and her
patient is essential to providing good treatment, thus it
seems likely that the more negative the clinical inter-
action, the worse the eventual treatment outcome (not
to mention the likelihood that the patient will consult
healthcare services for future worries or problems).
This is where the bulk of future research should be
concentrated.
The interactions between multiple patient characteris-
tics and between healthcare professional and patient
characteristics reveal the complexity of the phenomenon
of implicit bias and its influence on clinician-patient
interaction. They also highlight the pertinence of work
in feminist theory on ‘intersectionality’
, a term for the
distinctive issues that arise when a person belongs to
multiple identity categories that bring disadvantage, such
as being both black and female [55]. For instance, one
study only found evidence of bias against low SES Latina
patients, not against high SES Latinas, illustrating how
belonging to more than one category (here, both low
SES and Latina) can have negative effects that are not
present if membership of one category is eliminated
(here, low SES) [39]. Class may trump race in some cir-
cumstances so that being high SES is more salient than
being non-white. One criticism of mainstream feminism
by theorists who work on intersectionality is that per-
tinent issues are unexplored because of the dominance
of high SES white women in feminist theory. Using our
example from the review, high SES Latina women may
not experience the same prejudice as low SES Latina
women and thus may falsely assume that there is no
prejudice against Latina women tout court in this con-
text. This could be frustrating for low SES Latina
women who have unrecognized lived experiences of
prejudice in a clinical setting.
In some studies, the attitudes of patients towards
healthcare professionals were recorded and used to
evaluate clinical interaction [23, 24, 44]. It is important
to remember that patients also may come to a clinical
interaction with biases. In these cases, the biases of one
participant may trigger the biases of the other, magnifying
FitzGerald and Hurst BMC Medical Ethics  (2017) 18:19 
Page 14 of 18
 the first participant’s biased responses and leading to a
snowball effects [56]. Past experience of discrimination
may mean that a patient may come to an interaction with
negative expectations [57].
Our findings in the review suggest that the relation-
ship between training and experience and levels of im-
plicit bias is mixed. In one study, increased contact with
patients with Hepatitis C virus was associated with more
favourable explicit attitudes, yet more negative implicit
attitudes towards intravenous drug users [49]. Another
study demonstrated that nursing students were less pre-
judiced, more willing to help and desired more social
interaction with patients with brain injury, when com-
pared with qualified nurses [58]. Exposure to communi-
cation skills training was not associated with lower
race-IAT scores for physicians [23]. However, individ-
uals with mental health training demonstrated more
positive implicit and explicit evaluations of people with
mental illness than those without training [42]. Yet in
the same study, graduate students had more positive
implicit attitudes towards the mentally ill than mental
health professionals.
We included all types of implicit bias in our review,
not only race bias, partly in an effort to capture non-US
studies, hypothesising that the focus on race in the US
leaves fewer resources for investigation into other biases.
It is possibly the case that a wider range of biases were
investigated in non-US countries, but there is not
enough evidence to deduce this from our review alone.
For instance, two British studies examine bias against
brain-injured patients who are perceived as having con-
tributed to their injury [58, 59], and two Australian
studies looked at bias against intravenous drug users
[48, 49], but the sample size of studies is too small to
warrant drawing any conclusions from this.
Is it possible that there are implicit associations that
are justified because they are based on prevalence data
for diseases? One study in our review aimed to test the
statistical discrimination hypothesis by asking physi-
cians to estimate the prevalence data among males and
females for coronary heart disease in addition to
presenting them with vignettes of a female or male cor-
onary heart disease patient. It found that 48% of physi-
cians were inconsistent in their population-level and
individual level assessments and that the physicians’
gender-based population prevalence assessments were
not associated with the certainty of their diagnosis of
coronary heart disease. There was no evidence to sup-
port the theory of statistical discrimination as an ex-
planation for why physicians were less certain of their
diagnoses of CHD in women [36]. Another exploratory
study looked at the diseases that were stereotypically
associated with African-Americans and found that
many diseases were associated with African-Americans
that did not match prevalence data, such as drug abuse
[20]. The danger in these cases is that a physician may
apply a group-level stereotype to an individual and fail to
follow-up with a search for individuating information.
Impartial treatment of patients by healthcare profes-
sionals is an uncontroversial norm of healthcare. Impli-
cit biases have been identified as one possible factor in
healthcare disparities and our review reveals that they
are likely to have a negative impact on patients from
stigmatized groups. Our review also indicates that there
may sometimes be a gap between the norm of imparti-
ality and the extent to which it is embraced by health-
care professionals for some of the tested characteristics.
For instance, explicit anti-fat bias was found to be
prevalent among healthcare professionals [60]. Since
weight can be relevant to diagnosis and treatment, it is
understandable that it is salient. It is nonetheless
disturbing that healthcare professionals exhibit the
same explicit anti-fat attitudes prevalent in the general
population.
The most convincing studies from our review are
those that combine the IAT and a method measuring
the quality of treatment in the actual world. These
studies provide some evidence for a relationship be-
tween bias as measured by the IAT and behaviour by
clinicians that may contribute to healthcare disparities.
More studies using real-world interaction measures
would be helpful because studies using vignettes remain
open to the criticism that they do not reveal the true
behaviour of healthcare professionals. In this respect,
the three studies using measures of physician-patient
interaction are exemplary [22–24], in particular when
using independent evaluators of the interactions [23].
Overall, our review reveals the need for discussion of
methodology and for more interaction between differ-
ent literatures that focus on different biases.
Conclusion
Our findings highlight the need for the healthcare pro-
fession to address the role of implicit biases in disparities
in healthcare. In addition to addressing implicit biases,
measures need to be taken to raise awareness of the po-
tential conflict between holding negative explicit atti-
tudes towards some patient characteristics, such as
obesity, and committing to a norm to treat all patients
equally.
Our review reveals that this is an area in need of more
uniform methods of research to enable better compari-
son and communication between researchers interested
in different forms of bias. Important avenues for further
research include examination of the interactions be-
tween patient characteristics, and between healthcare
professional and patient characteristics, and of possible

 ways in which to tackle the presence of implicit biases in

Endnotes
1There are conceptual problems with this distinction
as used in psychology that have been pointed out by phi-
losophers, but we will ignore these for the purposes of
this review.
2Interestingly, physicians were also asked for how they
expected their colleagues to rate the vignette, and in
these ratings there was a negative bias towards both
patients from Ghana and from Serbia.
3Bias against patients who are seen as contributing to
their injury initially seems to be an odd category com-
pared to the more familiar ones of race and gender.
Clinicians may treat brain injured patients differently if
they are somehow seen as ‘responsible’ for their injury,
for instance, if they were engaging in risk-taking behaviour
such as drug taking. Our review was intended to capture
studies such as these that identify biases that are spe-
cific to clinical contexts and thus of particular interest
to clinicians.

Authors’ contributions
Both authors discussed to select the databases and decide on the research
question, based on CF’s knowledge of the field of implicit bias and SH’s
knowledge of systematic reviews and bioethics literature. CF compiled the
key words for the search strategy with constant advice and input from SH.
CF drafted the inclusion criteria and received constant input on this from SH:
CF carried out the search and downloaded the relevant articles to be
scrutinised. CF and SH both independently read all the initial titles to select
which were relevant, then the abstracts, and then the final included articles
and discussed at each stage to resolve any disagreements. CF drafted the
initial tables including the information from the studies and this was revised by
SH. SH particularly revised the statistical methods used by the studies and both
reviewed their methodology. CF drafted the manuscript and it was revised with
comments by SH a number of times until both authors were satisfied with the
manuscript. Both authors read and approved the final manuscript.
