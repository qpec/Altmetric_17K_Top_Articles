Abstract
Rationale: Restoration of vitamin D sufficiency may reduce
asthma exacerbations, events that are often associated with
respiratory tract infections and cold symptoms.
Objectives: To determine whether vitamin D supplementation
reduces cold symptom occurrence and severity in adults with
mild to moderate asthma and vitamin D insufficiency.
Methods: Colds were assessed in the AsthmaNet VIDA (Vitamin D
Add-on Therapy Enhances Corticosteroid Responsiveness) trial,
in which 408 adult patients were randomized to receive placebo
or cholecalciferol (100,000 IU load plus 4,000 IU/d) for 28 weeks
as add-on therapy. The primary outcome was cold symptom
severity, which was assessed using daily scores on the 21-item
Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey.
Measurements and Main Results: A total of 203 participants
experienced at least one cold. Despite achieving 25-hydroxyvitamin D
levels of 41.9 ng/ml (95% confidence interval [CI], 40.1–43.7 ng/ml)
by 12 weeks, vitamin D supplementation had no effect
on the primary outcome: the average peak WURSS-21
scores (62.0 [95% CI, 55.1–68.9; placebo] and 58.7
[95% CI, 52.4–65.0; vitamin D]; P = 0.39). The rate
of colds did not differ between groups (rate ratio [RR], 1.2;
95% CI, 0.9–1.5); however, among African Americans,
those receiving vitamin D versus placebo had an increased
rate of colds (RR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.1–2.7; P = 0.02). This
was also observed in a responder analysis of all subjects
achieving vitamin D sufficiency, regardless of treatment
assignment (RR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1–1.7; P = 0.009).
Conclusions: Our findings in patients with mild to
moderate asthma undergoing an inhaled corticosteroid
dose reduction do not support the use of vitamin D
supplementation for the purpose of reducing cold severity or
frequency.

 Vitamin D insufficiency is common in the
general population and has been linked to
susceptibility to respiratory infections (1–4).
Physiologically, vitamin D alters the
function of multiple cell types involved in
both the innate and the adaptive immune
systems, modulating pathways that can
participate in the response to respiratory
viral infections (5–9). Because of the results
of epidemiologic and physiologic studies,
trials have been conducted to determine
whether vitamin D supplementation
reduces respiratory infections, but the
findings of these trials have been mixed.
In children enrolled during the winter,
vitamin D supplementation with 1,200
IU/d for 4 months reduced laboratory-
confirmed influenza illnesses by 42%
(10). Likewise, ingestion of vitamin D
(300 IU/d)–fortified milk during the winter
reduced the incidence of acute respiratory
tract infections (RTIs) by 44% as assessed
using questionnaires with children (11).
However, monthly vitamin D doses of
100,000 IU for 18 months failed to reduce
reported and laboratory-confirmed upper
RTIs in adults (12). A metaanalysis of
11 randomized controlled trials indicated
that vitamin D supplements may prevent
RTIs when administered daily rather than
in high doses intermittently, although
heterogeneity among the trials prevented
a definitive conclusion (13). Recently,
researchers in a trial of 10,000 IU of
vitamin D3 weekly for 2 months in the fall
found that it did not affect the viral load
or clinical rate of colds, but that it did
reduce the incidence of laboratory-
confirmed viral RTIs in healthy adults
(14). Although very few of these studies
selectively enrolled patients with vitamin D
insufficiency, the results collectively suggest
that vitamin D supplementation may
protect against RTIs, particularly when
the supplements are taken daily.
Patients with asthma are prone to
more severe chest cold symptoms
despite having rates of RTIs similar to
those of healthy cohabitants (15).
Because vitamin D insufficiency is also
common in this population and may
have independent effects on lung function
and corticosteroid responsiveness (16), we
recently completed a trial of vitamin D
supplementation in patients with asthma
and baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D
[25(OH)D] insufficiency (17). Vitamin D
supplements taken daily for 28 weeks
did not reduce the rates of first asthma
treatment failure or exacerbations,
although this treatment modestly spared
the daily dose of inhaled corticosteroid
(ICS) when the corticosteroid was tapered
(17). There was a trend for a reduction
of the overall rate of exacerbations,
including multiple events per subject
associated with assignment to vitamin D
supplementation (hazard ratio, 0.63;
95% confidence interval [CI], 0.39–1.01;
P = 0.05). In a responder analysis, patients
achieving vitamin D sufficiency at
12 weeks, regardless of treatment
assignment, had a 40% reduction in overall
exacerbations compared with placebo,
with a 20% decrease noted for every
10–ng/ml improvement in 25(OH)D levels
(17). Because asthma exacerbations are
frequently caused by viral RTIs (15,
18–20), we sought to determine whether
vitamin D supplementation could reduce
the severity and rate of acute RTIs
(common colds) and the associated
changes in asthma control in adults with
mild to moderate asthma and vitamin D
insufficiency. A portion of this work has
been presented previously as a poster (21).
Methods
Study Population
We carried out a prospectively planned
secondary analysis of a multicenter,
randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled clinical trial (the VIDA
[Vitamin D Add-on Therapy Enhances
Corticosteroid Responsiveness] trial) (17).
Briefly, 408 adult patients with mild to
moderate asthma, baseline serum levels of
25(OH)D3 less than 30 ng/ml, and asthma
symptoms despite low-dose ICS therapy
were randomized to receive placebo or
cholecalciferol for 28 weeks (100,000 IU
once, then 4,000 IU/d for 28 wk) as add-on
therapy in the background of a tapering
ICS protocol.
Procedures
The visit structure and assessment of
treatment failure, exacerbation, lung function,
airway hyperresponsiveness, asthma
symptoms, asthma control (measured using
the Asthma Control Test [ACT] score [22]),
asthma-specific quality of life, 25(OH)D
levels, and ICS exposure have been described
previously (17). Cold symptoms were
assessed using the 21-item Wisconsin Upper
Respiratory Symptom Survey (WURSS-21), a
validated instrument with a range of 0–140
points and a minimal important difference
of 18.5 (23, 24). Instructions on how
to complete these surveys and their
distribution occurred at the randomization
visit, with reinforcement of its use at all
subsequent visits, which occurred at 4- to
6-week intervals. Electronic diaries were
used to assess asthma symptoms. In
the diaries, participants answered the
question, “Did you have a cold today”? If
they answered “yes,” they were instructed
to start completing WURSS-21 surveys
daily. Survey completion continued until
the first question on the survey (“How sick
do you feel today?”) was answered “not
sick” for 2 days in a row. All completed
surveys were returned to the study
coordinator at the participants’ next study
visit. Each participant was given 21 copies
of the WURSS-21 to keep at home in
the event that he or she experienced a
cold symptom between visits.
Melanin-dependent skin pigmentation
is a measure of sun exposure, which can
correlate with endogenous production
of 25(OH)D (25). Melanin levels were
estimated with a SmartProbe 400
spectrophotometer (IMS, Portland, ME).
This device is used to measure degrees
of pigmentation on a continuous scale from
0 to 100, with 0 being absolute black and
100 being absolute white. Pigmentation
measurements were made from the
At a Glance Commentary
Scientific Knowledge on the
Subject: Asthma exacerbations are
frequently caused by viral respiratory
tract infections (RTIs), but whether
vitamin D supplementation can reduce
the severity and rate of acute RTIs is
unknown. Recent studies suggest that
vitamin D supplementation may
protect against RTIs, particularly when
supplements are taken daily.
What This Study Adds to the
Field: Our study suggests that
replacement of vitamin D levels does
not affect the severity of colds but may
increase the frequency of cold
symptoms in select groups of patients
with asthma, particularly when the
dose of inhaled corticosteroid is being
reduced.

 forehead, outer forearm, inner upper arm,
and abdomen, with two readings averaged
and recorded at each location. We
proposed that the difference between the
forearm and abdominal readings would
be a surrogate measure of degree of sun
exposure. Skin pigmentation was measured
before and after the 28 weeks of vitamin D
supplementation.
Statistical Analysis
Testing the primary hypothesis regarding
the effect of vitamin D supplementation
on the severity of colds was addressed by
fitting a repeated-measures analysis of
covariance (RM-ANCOVA) model to
the peak WURSS-21 cold scores during each
cold, allowing for multiple colds for each
participant. Assuming that the incidence
of colds in our study was similar to that
seen in the Asthma Clinical Research
Network’s Post-cold Asthma Control and
Exacerbation study (24), we estimated that
65 participants per group would experience
at least one cold (32.4%). With this
sample size, we expected to have over
90% power to detect an effect size of 18,
assuming that the power in our analyses
was increased by the inclusion of multiple
colds for each person (two-sided a, 0.05;
SD, 32).
In addition to evaluating the average
peak cold score from each cold, the average
scores on Day 1 and Day 2 were also
compared between the intervention and
control groups. The rates of colds were
compared between the treatment groups
using Poisson regression. Each model
included adjustment for center, African
American race, and body mass index
(BMI) greater than 25 kg/m2 (similar to the
parent trial [17]). Exploratory analyses to
investigate the effect of treatment on cold
severity and rate at different levels of
baseline factors [African American race,
BMI .25 kg/m2, baseline 25(OH)D level,
cold season] were conducted via the
inclusion of nested effects in the RM-
ANCOVA and Poisson regression models.
A responder analysis was performed
to compare the cold severity and rate

 measures between those participants who
became vitamin D sufficient [achieving a
25(OH)D level >30 ng/ml by 12 wk
postrandomization] with those of
participants who did not become vitamin D
sufficient, regardless of treatment. This
analysis was also performed using RM-
ANCOVA and Poisson regression models
as described above. In addition, 25(OH)D
level at 12 weeks and change in the
difference between the forearm and
abdominal readings for melanin
pigmentation were evaluated as potential
factors in each of these models. The impact
of an RTI on the subsequent development
of a treatment failure or exacerbation,
regardless of treatment assignment, was
assessed using Kaplan-Meier methods for
the first event and Poisson regression for
the analysis of multiple events. The change
in the ACT score during a cold was
compared with the change in the ACT
score throughout the duration of the study
in those who did not experience a cold.
This comparison was made using an
RM-ANCOVA model adjusted for center,
African American race, and BMI greater
than 25 kg/m2. All tests were two-sided,
with a P value less than 0.05 denoting
significance. Without formal adjustment for
the number of secondary analyses that were
performed, the secondary results should be
considered exploratory. All analyses were
performed using SAS version 9.3 software
(SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

 a cold during the study, stratified by
treatment assignment. In the original
trial, there were no baseline characteristic
differences noted between treatment
assignments (17). This randomization
process was also successful when we
evaluated participants who had a cold
during the course of the trial; the exceptions
noted were small differences in baseline
melanin (Tables 1 and 2).
Cold Severity and Frequency
Figure 1 demonstrates the month of
occurrence of the colds. The average peak
WURSS-21 score for the group of subjects
with colds was 61.3 (95% CI, 57.6–65.0).
We defined time until RTI improvement as
the time until the WURSS-21 score was
less than 50% of the peak value for
2 consecutive days (24). The median time
to improvement was 4 days with an
interquartile range of 3–6 days. Participants
with a cold had a decline in their ACT
scores (average, 21.3; 95% CI, 21.8
to 20.8) at the visit after the cold that
was significantly different from the
change in ACT scores over the course
of the entire treatment period for
subjects who did not experience a cold
(average, 0.2; 95% CI, 20.4 to 0.8;
P , 0.001) (Figure 2, left). The minimally
important differences for the ACT score
range between 2 and 3, depending on the
methods and population studied (26). In
our study, a cold increased the odds of
having an ACT score decline of at least 2
(OR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.01–2.49; P = 0.043)
(Figure 2, right).
There were no significant differences
between treatment groups in the adjusted
models for the WURSS-21 scores on Day 1,
Day 2, the sum of Days 1 and 2, the
sum of Days 1–4, or the sum of Days 1–7
(Figure 3A). The time course of the
WURSS-21 scores is shown in Figure 3B,
reflecting symptoms experienced by the
participants during the first 14 days
after the start of their colds, stratified by
treatment assignment. The peak WURSS-
21 cold score for participants assigned to
placebo was 62.0 (95% CI, 55.1–68.9), and
the peak for subjects receiving vitamin D
was 58.7 (95% CI, 52.4–65.0). This
difference was not significant before or after
adjustment for center, African American
race, and BMI greater than 25 kg/m2
(P = 0.39 by RM-ANCOVA). There were
no differences between treatment groups in
terms of the time to improvement, even
when we allowed for multiple colds per
person.
Of those participants with at least
one cold, the median number of colds
per subject was 1, with an interquartile
range of 1–2. Seventeen subjects had
three colds, two subjects had four colds,
and one subject had five colds. With respect

 to overall rate in the two treatment
groups, there were 139 colds among
the 207 subjects in the placebo group,
for a rate of 1.24 colds per person-year,
and 161 colds experienced by the 201
subjects receiving vitamin D, with a rate
of 1.48 colds per person-year. The rate
ratio for the effect of vitamin D on the
rate of colds was 1.2 with a 95%
confidence interval of 0.9–1.5 (P = 0.15
in adjusted Poisson regression model).
This effect was not different by center or
BMI class; however, among African
American participants, those receiving
vitamin D had a higher rate of colds
than those who received placebo
(rate ratio, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.1–2.7;
P = 0.02).
Responder Analysis
Despite enrollment of 217 (53.2%) of
408 subjects with baseline 25(OH)D levels
less than 20 ng/ml, 82% of the participants
assigned to receive vitamin D achieved
sufficiency, reaching a level greater
than 30 ng/ml after 12 weeks of treatment,
with a mean level of 41.9 ng/ml (95% CI,
40.1–43.7 ng/ml). Additionally, 9% of the
subjects who received placebo treatment
achieved 25(OH)D sufficiency (17).
Figure 4 (light gray bars) shows similar
overall rates of colds in patients stratified by
their baseline 25(OH)D levels. In a
responder analysis in which we compared
only those subjects who achieved
sufficiency with those who did not,
regardless of treatment assignment,
achieving vitamin D sufficiency had no
effect on any of the cold severity measures
(P . 0.1 in all cases). Also, as shown in
Figure 4 (dark gray bars), vitamin D
responders had a higher rate of colds
relative to nonresponders (1.4; 95% CI,
1.1–1.7; P = 0.009). Analysis of the
25(OH)D level achieved at 12 weeks
postrandomization as a predictor of cold
severity did not reveal a difference when
this was evaluated as a main effect (P . 0.4
for all cold severity measures) or nested
within cold season (P . 0.1 for all seasons).
Additionally, adjustment by the change
in the difference between the forearm
and abdominal readings for melanin
pigmentation did not show significance
(P . 0.05 in all cases).
Discussion
In symptomatic patients with mild to
moderate asthma and baseline insufficiency
of vitamin D in the setting of ICS dose
reduction (17), those assigned to an
effective vitamin D supplementation
regimen did not have less severe or less
frequent colds than subjects who received
placebo treatment (Figure 3). Although this
was a negative result, it is worth noting that
the frequency of colds in this prespecified
analysis conferred over 90% power to
observe an effect size that was smaller than
the minimal clinically important difference
for the survey instrument used. The
observation period was slightly longer than
6 months, ensuring that each subject was
followed during at least one cold season.
Adjustment for season of enrollment or sun
exposure did not change these results. We

 conclude that the lack of effect on cold
severity in the overall study population is
valid and unlikely to change without
significant modification of the study design.
A few caveats prevent broad
generalization of this study’s results.
These include the mild to moderate severity
of baseline asthma and acute cold
symptoms in the patient population
studied. Patients with more severe asthma
who had a history of frequent RTI-induced
exacerbations might be an ideal population
in which to evaluate respiratory samples
during the course of the cold to confirm
virus-associated events. Additionally,
the ICS tapering protocol may have had
unanticipated effects. For example, we
hypothesized but did not observe (17) that
achieving vitamin D sufficiency would
allow for enhanced responsiveness to ICS
with respect to lung function owing to the
ability of vitamin D to influence steroid
metabolism. Conversely, it is also possible
that the change in ICS doses during the
protocol influenced vitamin D metabolism
and/or the expression of the vitamin D
receptor and binding protein. With these
considerations in mind, it is possible
that we did not give enough vitamin D and
that 25(OH)D levels in the serum do
not reflect the changes relevant to airway
epithelium innate immunity. This is
unlikely in that the supplementation
strategy used in this trial achieved a
25(OH)D level of 41.9 ng/ml (95% CI,
40.1–43.7 ng/ml) by 12 weeks (17) and
epithelial cell conversion of 25(OH)D to the
1,25-dihydroxy active metabolite starts
to plateau at around 40 ng/ml. These
levels are sufficient for subsequent
expression of cathelicidin and CD14 (27).
Researchers who conduct future studies in
this area should use a fixed dose of ICS
(or none) and verify end-target effects
of vitamin D supplementation, perhaps
by including evaluation of changes in
epithelial cell vitamin D–responsive gene
expression.
We observed that achieving vitamin
D sufficiency increased cold frequency.
The direction of this effect is opposite
to our hypothesis and appears to be driven
by the subjects of African American race,
who also had the lowest mean baseline
vitamin D level (15.6 ng/ml [95% CI,
14.4–16.8] vs. 20.4 ng/ml [95% CI,
19.6–21.2] for all other races [17]). This is
also contrary in some ways to the
observation that patients achieving vitamin
D sufficiency have a lower overall rate of
exacerbations (17). It is unlikely that
vitamin D levels have any influence on
exposure to respiratory viruses. One
speculation is that patients with 25(OH)D
levels less than 20 ng/ml may be more likely
than patients with higher levels to have
asymptomatic upper RTI when exposed to
common cold viruses, and in this case
replacement of vitamin D could
reconstitute the inflammatory responses
related to symptom development. This
reconstitution could lead to a greater
likelihood of upper airway symptoms
while also reducing the likelihood of
lower airway infection and related risk of
exacerbation. Of note, the median severity
of the cold symptoms in a qualitative
assessment was mild. Reconciling these
possibilities would likely be best
addressed by using an inoculation study
design, before and after vitamin D
supplementation.
In conclusion, the statistical power,
frequency of study visits, and lack of a
signal in the present trial suggest that
longer studies or those in which higher
vitamin D levels are achieved are
unlikely to change the implication that
restoration of vitamin D sufficiency does
not impact cold severity in patients with
mild to moderate asthma undergoing an
ICS dose reduction and may increase
the rate of symptomatic colds in
patients with the lowest baseline levels
of vitamin D. n
