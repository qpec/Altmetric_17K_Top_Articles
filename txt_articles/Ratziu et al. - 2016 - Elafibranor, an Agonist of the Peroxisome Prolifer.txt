BACKGROUND & AIMS: Elafibranor is an agonist of the perox-
isome
proliferator�activated
receptor-a
and
peroxisome
proliferator�activated receptor-d. Elafibranor improves insulin
sensitivity, glucose homeostasis, and lipid metabolism and reduces
inflammation. We assessed the safety and efficacy of elafibranor in
an international, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial
of patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). METHODS:
Patients with NASH without cirrhosis were randomly assigned to
groups given elafibranor 80 mg (n ¼ 93), elafibranor 120 mg (n ¼
91), or placebo (n ¼ 92) each day for 52 weeks at sites in Europe
and the United States. Clinical and laboratory evaluations were
performed every 2 months during this 1-year period. Liver bi-
opsies were then collected and patients were assessed 3 months
later. The primary outcome was resolution of NASH without
fibrosis worsening, using protocol-defined and modified defini-
tions. Data from the groups given the different doses of elafi-
branor were compared with those from the placebo group using
step-down logistic regression, adjusting for baseline nonalco-
holic fatty liver disease activity score. RESULTS: In intention-to-
treat analysis, there was no significant difference between the
elafibranor and placebo groups in the protocol-defined primary
outcome. However, NASH resolved without fibrosis worsening in
a higher proportion of patients in the 120-mg elafibranor group vs
the placebo group (19% vs 12%; odds ratio ¼ 2.31; 95% confi-
dence interval: 1.02�5.24; P ¼ .045), based on a post-hoc analysis
for the modified definition. In post-hoc analyses of patients with
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity score �4 (n ¼ 234), ela-
fibranor 120 mg resolved NASH in larger proportions of patients
than placebo based on the protocol definition (20% vs 11%; odds
ratio ¼ 3.16; 95% confidence interval: 1.22�8.13; P ¼ .018) and
the modified definitions (19% vs 9%; odds ratio ¼ 3.52; 95%
confidence interval: 1.32–9.40; P ¼ .013). Patients with NASH
resolution after receiving elafibranor 120 mg had reduced liver
fibrosis stages compared with those without NASH resolution
(mean reduction of 0.65 ± 0.61 in responders for the primary
outcome vs an increase of 0.10 ± 0.98 in nonresponders; P <
.001). Liver enzymes, lipids, glucose profiles, and markers of
systemic inflammation were significantly reduced in the elafi-
branor 120-mg group vs the placebo group. Elafibranor was
well tolerated and did not cause weight gain or cardiac events, but
did produce a mild, reversible increase in serum creatinine (effect
size vs placebo: increase of 4.31 ± 1.19 mmol/L; P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: A post-hoc analysis of data from trial of patients
with NASH showed that elafibranor (120 mg/d for 1 year)
resolved NASH without fibrosis worsening, based on a modified
definition, in the intention-to-treat analysis and in patients with
moderate or severe NASH. However, the predefined end point was
not met in the intention to treat population. Elafibranor was well
tolerated and improved patients’ cardiometabolic risk profile.

 O
f all chronic liver diseases, nonalcoholic steatohe-
patitis (NASH) is of increasing concern, as it is
highly prevalent, potentially severe and without approved
therapy. NASH defines a subgroup of nonalcoholic fatty liver
disease where liver steatosis coexists with hepatic cell
injury (apoptosis and hepatocyte ballooning), and inflam-
mation.1 It occurs in close association with overweight/
obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiometabolic conditions that
define the metabolic syndrome.2 Because of the prevalence
of these comorbidities, NASH is emerging as the most
common chronic liver disease.
NASH promotes liver fibrosis and some patients prog-
ress to severe hepatic diseases, including cirrhosis, liver
failure, hepatocellular carcinoma, or require liver trans-
plantation.3,4 Liver-related mortality is increased 10-fold in
NASH patients compared with the general population.5
However, NASH is also a multisystem disease that could
worsen insulin resistance, the metabolic syndrome, and the
systemic inflammatory state.6 Consequently, NASH patients
also have an increased rate of cardiovascular events and
neoplasia. These 2 latter conditions carry the heaviest toll in
terms of mortality, the leading cause of death being from
cardiovascular events.3,7,8
Peroxisome proliferator�activated receptors (PPARs)
are nuclear receptors playing key roles in cellular processes
regulating metabolic homeostasis, immune-inflammation,
and differentiation. PPARg agonists demonstrated efficacy
in improving histology in NASH,9–11 but side effects, such as
congestive heart failure, peripheral edema, bone fractures,
and weight gain severely restrict their prescription and
acceptance as long-term therapies. PPARa is most promi-
nently expressed in the liver and is activated by hypolipi-
demic fibrates. PPARa controls the lipid flux in the liver by
modulating fatty acid transport and b-oxidation, while
improving plasma lipids by decreasing triglycerides and
increasing high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol.12 In
addition, PPARa activation inhibits inflammatory genes
induced by nuclear factor-kB and decreases the expression
of acute-phase response genes.12 PPARd (also called PPARb)
regulates metabolism in liver and peripheral tissues. PPARd
agonists enhance fatty acid transport and oxidation, in-
crease HDL levels, and improve glucose homeostasis by
enhancing insulin sensitivity and inhibiting hepatic glucose
output.13 Importantly, PPARd exerts anti-inflammatory ac-
tivities in macrophages and Kupffer cells.14 In a pilot trial, a
selective PPARd agonist reduced liver fat content, while
improving insulin sensitivity, plasma lipids, and decreasing
g-glutamyltransferase.15
Elafibranor (GFT505) is a dual PPARa/d agonist that has
demonstrated efficacy in disease models of nonalcoholic
fatty liver disease (NAFLD)/NASH and liver fibrosis.16 Ela-
fibranor confers liver protection by acting on several path-
ways involved in NASH pathogenesis, reducing steatosis,
inflammation, and fibrosis. In phase 2a trials in dyslipi-
demic, prediabetic and type 2 diabetic patients, elafibranor
consistently improved plasma lipids and glucose homeo-
stasis,
peripheral
and
hepatic
insulin
resistance,
and
reduced liver inflammatory markers.17,18
This phase II study was conducted to assess the efficacy
of elafibranor for NASH in an international, randomized,
placebo-controlled, multicenter, 1-year clinical trial.
Methods
Study Design
This
international,
multicenter,
randomized
placebo-
controlled study tested elafibranor at the dose of 80 mg and
120 mg once a day vs placebo over 52 weeks and was con-
ducted at 56 sites, 19 in the United States and 37 in 8 Euro-
pean countries. The study had a staggered design as requested
by the regulatory agencies to test the safety of elafibranor
during a 6-month period at the lower dose before exposing
patients for 1 year at the highest dose. During the first
recruitment phase, 172 patients were screened between
September 2012 and June 2013 for treatment with 80 mg/d of
elafibranor or placebo (allocation 2:1). The second recruit-
ment period at the dose of 120 mg/d started in July 2013,
when 179 patients were screened in 1 week. The randomiza-
tion of this second cohort started in October 2013 (allocation
of elafibranor 120 mg or placebo in a 2:1 ratio), after unre-
stricted approval from the Independent Data and Safety
Monitoring Board. The clinical study protocol was approved in
all countries by National Authorities and Ethics Committees.
All patients gave written informed consent. All authors had
access to the study data and have approved and reviewed the
final manuscript.
Patients
The inclusion criteria included age 18 to 75 years and a
histologic diagnosis of noncirrhotic NASH confirmed by a cen-
tral pathologist. Patients were excluded if daily alcohol con-
sumption was more than 2 drink units/d (equivalent to 20 g) in
women and 3 drink units/d (30 g) in men, if steatohepatitis
was due to secondary causes, or if any other chronic liver
disease was identified.
Randomization and Masking
Randomization
was
obtained
through
a
computer-
generated coding list, and treatment allocation was per-
formed centrally for all sites through a web system, based on
date of randomization, and stratified for diabetes. No stratifi-
cation was made on investigation sites. Elafibranor and placebo
were provided as identical capsules in wallets labeled with
code numbers. Patients, investigators, clinical site staff, and the
pathologist were masked to treatment assignment. The alloca-
tion of treatment was done in a 1:1:1 ratio for the 3 treatment
arms—placebo, elafibranor 80 mg, and elafibranor 120 mg.
Procedures
Patients were followed every 2 months with clinical and
laboratory evaluations throughout the 1-year treatment period.
An end-of-treatment biopsy and a 3-month post-treatment
follow-up
visit
were
performed.
Screening
and
end-of-
treatment biopsies were all read centrally by a single pathol-
ogist in a blinded manner (PB). At end of study, all slides
(baseline and end of study) were read in scrambled order. For
inclusion, the liver biopsy needed to be collected within the

 past 9 months. Steatohepatitis was diagnosed based on the
presence
of
steatosis
(>5%
of
hepatocytes),
hepatocyte
ballooning, and lobular inflammation. Fibrosis was evaluated
using the NASH CRN fibrosis staging system. Included patients
had an NAFLD activity score (NAS) ranging from 3 to 8, with at
least 1 for steatosis, ballooning, and inflammation. All stages of
fibrosis (0�3) were accepted, except for cirrhosis. Noninvasive
panels for steatosis or fibrosis (Fatty Liver Index, SteatoTest,
Fibrotest, and the NAFLD Fibrosis score) were measured at
baseline, 6 months, and 12 months (end of treatment). Biologic
assessments were all centralized and performed at each visit
for efficacy and safety purposes.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was reversal of NASH without
worsening of fibrosis. This was defined as per protocol, before
study start, as the absence (score of 0) of at least 1 of the 3
components
of
NASH,
that is, steatosis, ballooning,
and
inflammation; worsening of fibrosis was defined as the pro-
gression to bridging fibrosis (ie, stage 3) or cirrhosis in patients
without bridging fibrosis at baseline or to cirrhosis in patients
with bridging fibrosis at baseline.
After the study was completed, a modified and more
stringent definition was proposed by academic and regulatory
experts and recommended by regulatory agencies for ongoing
trials.19,20 It defines resolution of NASH as disappearance of
ballooning (score ¼ 0), together with either disappearance of
lobular inflammation or the persistence of mild lobular
inflammation only (score ¼ 0 or 1), and resulting in an overall
pathologic diagnosis of either steatosis alone or steatosis with
mild inflammation; any stage increase in fibrosis is considered
fibrosis progression. Because this more stringent definition is
now used for current and future trials, we will here report on
both the protocol-defined and the post-hoc analysis of the
modified definition.
Secondary outcomes included changes in NAS between end
of treatment and baseline biopsy (including the proportion of
patients with a 2-point decrease); changes and improvements
in individual histologic scores of steatosis, ballooning, inflam-
mation, and fibrosis; changes in liver enzymes, in noninvasive
markers of steatosis and fibrosis, in lipid and glycemic pa-
rameters, in surrogate markers of insulin resistance (fasting
insulin and Homeostasis Model Assessment Index scores);
changes in systemic inflammatory markers; and safety and
tolerability of elafibranor at both doses.
Statistical Methods
The main selection was the population of all randomized
patients that received at least one dose of study drug (inten-
tion-to-treat [ITT] sample). To assess the robustness of
findings, sensitivity analyses were performed using the per-
protocol population defined as the ITT population with avail-
able liver biopsy at the end of the study. For sensitivity
purposes, the following post-hoc selections were considered:
patients with baseline NAS (bNAS) �4 (moderate or high dis-
ease activity), who are similar to those included in previous
NASH trials11,21; patients with bNAS �4 and fibrosis of any
stage at baseline; patients with bNAS �4 and fibrosis stage �2
at baseline (target patient population for current phase 3 tri-
als), and patients with bNAS �4 recruited in centers that
randomized at least 1 patient in each treatment arm (justified
by the strong treatment-center imbalance). The ITT population
was the main selection and a significant effect observed in the
ITT population was conditional to test the significance in the
other subpopulations.
The main analysis was a mixed model featuring logistic
regression on therapy response with treatment as fixed factor
(placebo, 80 mg, and 120 mg), adjusted for bNAS. The multi-
center context was accounted for by random factor. Based on
the assumption of superiority of the 120-mg dose, testing the
80-mg dose was conditional to the significance of the effect of
120 mg (step-down testing22). No multiplicity correction was
needed due to step-down strategy.22 For patients with liver
biopsy unavailable at the end of treatment, a worst-case
imputation in assimilating missing value to therapy failure
was considered.
Post-hoc analyses tested the main treatment effect and its
interaction with baseline severity (bNAS).
For easier clinical discussion, risk ratio was reported with
odds ratio (OR) derived from logistic regression. Geometric
mean change over baseline and related t tests were used to
compare the treatment subgroups on biologic parameters,
composite biomarker scores for NAFLD and fibrosis.
For sample size calculations, we assumed a 20% and 45%
responder rate in the placebo and 120-mg dose groups,
respectively, and a dropout rate of 25%. Ninety patients per
group were required to reach this difference, with a power of
80% at a 2-sided .05 significance test level. The analyses were
conducted with the Statistical Package R (release 3.1.1), all tests
were conducted at .05 two-sided level.
Role of the Funding Source
The GOLDEN-505 study was sponsored by Genfit SA. The
protocol was written by a panel of academic experts and
sponsor representatives and amended in accordance to input
from regulatory bodies. The corresponding author had full
access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility
for manuscript submission.
Results
A total of 276 patients were randomized, 92 in the pla-
cebo group, 93 in the elafibranor 80 mg group, and 91 in the
elafibranor 120-mg group (Figure 1). Two patients did not
receive the study medication and the remaining 274 pa-
tients constitute the ITT population. Thirty-three patients
(12%) dropped out during the study (Supplementary
Table 1). Final liver biopsies were available in 237 pa-
tients (77, 82, and 78 patients in the placebo, elafibranor 80
mg, and elafibranor 120 mg groups, respectively). Of these,
only 5 patients were no longer diagnosed as having NASH
on the baseline biopsy upon scrambled re-reading at end of
study. This did not modify the overall results.
Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics across treat-
ment groups. The elafibranor arms contained fewer Cauca-
sians, fewer men, more diabetics, and overall higher
Homeostasis Model Assessment Index�Insulin Resistance
(HOMA-IR) and insulin levels than the placebo group.
Table 2 shows the response rates and corresponding
risk ratios in the ITT population for the primary outcome.

 There was no difference between the elafibranor arms and
placebo according to the protocol-defined definition. A post-
hoc analysis using the modified definition of response
shows that the response rate was significantly higher for the
120-mg arm than for placebo (19% vs 12%; OR ¼ 2.31;
95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02�5.24; P ¼ .045). The
80-mg arm did not perform better than placebo for both
definitions of response, the protocol-based and the modified
definition (OR ¼ 1.48; 95% CI: 0.7�3.14; P ¼ .30 and 1.11,
95% CI: 0.48�2.57; P ¼ .80, respectively), or for any other
histologic analysis.
Results
of
the
secondary
histologic
outcomes
(Supplementary Table 3) show no significant difference
between elafibranor and placebo. Nonetheless, the efficacy
of the 120-mg dose to reduce the NAS by 2 points and to
improve steatosis, ballooning, and lobular inflammation was
more pronounced with increasing baseline severity, in
contrast to the absence of a clear pattern in the placebo or
80-mg groups.
A number of post-hoc, secondary analyses were per-
formed. Importantly, there was a strong interaction effect
between baseline severity and elafibranor dose, which was
significant for 120 mg for both the protocol-defined (OR ¼
2.63; 95% CI: 1.25�5.52; P ¼ .012) and modified defini-
tion
(OR
¼
2.76;
95%
CI:
1.33�5.76;
P
¼
.007)
(Supplementary Table 2). The significant interaction effect
with baseline severity indicated that the efficacy of elafi-
branor 120 mg vs placebo increased with baseline
severity. Hence, the exclusion of patients with mild disease
activity (bNAS ¼ 3, n ¼ 40) revealed a significant direct
effect of elafibranor 120 mg vs placebo (OR ¼ 3.16; 95%
CI: 1.22�8.13 and OR ¼ 3.52; 95% CI: 1.32�9.40, for the
protocol-defined and modified definitions, respectively) in
the remaining population of 234 patients with bNAS �4
(85% of the ITT population); there was no significant
difference for the 80-mg arm. Overall, the 120-mg elafi-
branor dose doubled the proportion of responders vs
placebo in patients with bNAS �4.

 As patient recruitment was based on a wide spectrum of
baseline severity (NAS 3�8 and fibrosis stage 0�3), we
performed post-hoc analyses in NAS �4 populations with
increasing fibrosis stages (Table 3). The response rates of
120 mg elafibranor for the protocol-defined definition were
significantly higher than that of placebo, while there was no
significant difference for the 80-mg arm. The 120-mg dose
was also more effective in the subpopulation of patients
with any fibrosis (F1�F3), as well as in those with moderate
or advanced fibrosis (F2�F3) (Table 3). The results were
qualitatively similar when using the modified definition
(data not shown).

 staggered design and an unexpected high rate of recruit-
ment), we performed an analysis in the subset of bNAS �4
patients recruited in centers that randomized at least 1
patient in each treatment arm (n ¼ 120, Supplementary
Table 4). The response rates were 29% and 26% (proto-
col-defined and modified definitions) vs 5% placebo (P ¼
.01 and.02, respectively). Forty-eight percent of patients
improved the NAS by �2 points (vs 21% in the placebo arm;
P ¼ .013). Hepatocyte ballooning and lobular inflammation
were also significantly improved, with a trend toward
improvement in steatosis but not fibrosis.
Finally, we tested whether patients that achieved reso-
lution of NASH without worsening of fibrosis in the 120-mg
elafibranor arm also experienced improvement in fibrosis.
Supplementary Figure 1 shows strong reductions in fibrosis,
hepatocyte ballooning, and the NAS (all P < .001), as well as
in lobular inflammation and steatosis (both P < .05), when
compared with nonresponders to the same regimen. These
findings were similar with both definitions of response.
Patients treated with both elafibranor doses (80 mg and
120 mg) improved liver function tests (alanine amino-
transferase, g-glutamyltransferase, and alkaline phospha-
tase; Figure 2A�C) and lipid parameters (triglycerides,
low-density
lipoprotein
cholesterol,
HDL
cholesterol,
Figure 2D�F). In diabetic patients (40% of the Intention to
Treat population), elafibranor improved fasting serum
glucose (�0.98 ± 0.56 mmol/L for 120 mg vs placebo; P ¼
.08) and HbA1c (�0.46% for 120 mg vs placebo; P ¼ .038),
as well as markers of insulin resistance (fasting insulin,
HOMA-IR, and circulating free fatty acids, Figure 3). There
was a clear reduction in systemic inflammatory markers,
such as high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (�42% for 120
mg vs placebo; P ¼ .161), fibrinogen, and haptoglobin at
both doses (Supplementary Figure 2A). In line with the
histologic changes, serum panel biomarkers of steatosis and
fibrosis, such as SteatoTest, Fatty Liver Index, Fibrotest/
FibroSure, and the NAFLD Fibrosis score, showed significant
reductions in patients treated with elafibranor 120 mg
compared with placebo (Supplementary Figure 2B).
Elafibranor was safe and well tolerated. Clinical adverse
events were mostly mild and similar in the placebo and
elafibranor arms (Table 4). There were no cardiovascular
events or deaths in the elafibranor arms. Six patients (6.5%)
were discontinued for adverse events in the placebo group, 7
(7.9%) in the 80-mg group, and 5 (5.4%) in the 120-mg
groups. There was a mild, reversible but statistically signifi-
cant increase in serum creatinine (effect size vs placebo: 4.31
± 1.19 mmol/L; P < .001). Other renal markers, such as
cystatin C and microalbuminuria, remained normal. The in-
crease in creatinine led to a reported renal impairment/
failure in 7 patients treated with elafibranor (Supplementary
Table 5). All of them had increased creatinine at baseline; 1

Discussion
This randomized controlled trial provides evidence of
efficacy of the dual PPARa/d activator elafibranor on both
histologic reversal of NASH and metabolic improvement in
patients with NASH. Both are important objectives on the
path of controlling NASH. Steatohepatitis is indirectly
associated with reduced hepatic survival in NAFLD.5,23 It
drives fibrogenesis, a slow process of hepatic scar formation
that can result in cirrhosis and its deadly complications,
such as liver failure, portal hypertension, and hepatocellular

 carcinoma. Consequently, clearance of steatohepatitis,24 that
is, reversal to a normal liver or to steatosis without
steatohepatitis—a condition not associated with increased
hepatic morbidity or mortality—is expected to improve

When analyzed according to the a priori, protocol-
defined primary outcome, there were no significant dif-
ferences in treatment response between the 2 elafibranor
groups and placebo. However, when using an updated,
modified definition of reversal of NASH without worsening
of fibrosis,19,20 the 120-mg elafibranor arm performed
significantly better than placebo in the ITT population. The
latter definition is more stringent than the one used in the
protocol. First, it emphasizes hepatocyte ballooning, a sign
of liver-cell injury and a cardinal feature of steatohepatitis
that is associated with disease progression and enhanced
fibrogenesis. In contrast, the protocol-based definition
required the disappearance of either steatosis, inflamma-
tion, or hepatocyte ballooning. Second, based on older data
showing that bridging fibrosis but not earlier stages is
associated with liver-related mortality,23,27–29 only pro-
gression to bridging fibrosis (or to cirrhosis) was consid-
ered
“worsening
of
fibrosis”
in
the
protocol-based
definition. Instead, the modified definition defines wors-
ening of fibrosis as any one-stage increase based on recent
data showing that even early fibrosis is associated with
global and liver-related mortality.7 Importantly, this more
stringent definition led to a lower placebo effect. Earlier
studies have not explicitly defined reversal of NASH and
subtle differences in the criteria used might explain the
variable rates of response in the placebo group (from
13%21 to 21%11). Therapeutics in NASH is an evolving field
and previous trials have used an aggregate histologic score,
the NAS, as a primary end point.11,21 However, the prog-
nostic value of the NAS is not established.7,23,30 We expect
that future, large phase 3 trials will be using this more
stringent definition of response and, therefore, we reported
on both definitions of primary response in an attempt to
facilitate comparisons of the magnitude of the effect both
across trials and across classes of pharmacologic agents.
Interestingly, for both definitions there was a significant
interaction effect with baseline activity, suggesting that the
latter is an important determinant of the efficacy of
elafibranor.
Regardless of the definition of response, elafibranor at
120 mg was significantly superior to placebo in the post-hoc
analysis after excluding the 15% of patients with mild
steatohepatitis (ie, bNAS of 3). The 80-mg dose was not
significantly better than placebo in any primary or second-
ary histologic analyses. Patients with mild but well-defined
NASH were allowed to participate because of early concerns
about recruitment feasibility, and because it was assumed
that resolution of NASH was dependent on the presence of
NASH and not on a particular level of severity. In these
patients with mild steatohepatitis, there was an unexpect-
edly high placebo response rate that might have led to a lack
of treatment effect in the planned primary outcome
assessment. In addition, the observation that elafibranor is
more efficient in more severe disease is consistent with
recent data showing that hepatic PPARa expression is
reduced in advanced inflammatory and fibrotic NASH and
that resolution of NASH is associated with a recovery of
PPARa expression.31 Whatever the explanation for the fail-
ure of elafibranor to significantly outperform placebo in
patients with mild disease, it is important to note that these
patients are usually not considered eligible for pharmaco-
logic therapy, but rather should be managed through dietary
and lifestyle changes. The 2 previous large trials in NASH
that had NAS reduction as a primary outcome, only included
patients with an NAS �4,11,21 and current practice for drug
development is to include only patients with moderate or
severe disease, defined by a NAS �4. Similarly, it has been
shown that fibrosis is a strong predictor of liver-related
deaths7 and patients with fibrosis are at highest need for

Elafibranor RCT for NASH 1155

 pharmacotherapy. In secondary analyses of patients with
moderate or severe NASH, 120 mg elafibranor was better
than placebo, regardless of the presence or severity of
fibrosis. The histologic benefit of the 120-mg dose was
mirrored by a significant improvement in liver function
tests, in particular alanine aminotransferase, g-glutamyl-
transferase, and alkaline phosphatase, and in noninvasive
serum panels of steatosis (Steatotest, Fatty Liver Index) and
fibrosis (NAFLD Fibrosis score and Fibrotest), which are
likely more sensitive and earlier response indicators than
histology.
In order to randomize 270 patients, 56 sites were
selected, with competitive recruitment and centralized
randomization. Due to the unexpectedly high recruitment
rates and the staggered design, treatment distribution
across the sites was imbalanced. Patient recruitment ranged
from 1 to 24 randomized patients per site, and only 15 sites
had patients randomized in all 3 treatment arms. In an
exploratory, post-hoc analysis designed to control for both
center effect and baseline severity, the efficacy of 120 mg
elafibranor was explored in the subset of patients with
bNAS �4 from centers that randomized at least 1 patient
per treatment arm. Both NASH resolution and a reduction
by �2 points in the NAS were achieved more often than
placebo. Interestingly, the 21% response rate of the placebo
arm for a 2-point NAS reduction is comparable to previous
studies,11,21 thus suggesting that this subgroup of the pop-
ulation is representative of patients included in previous
trials.
Because prevention of the occurrence of cirrhosis is the
ultimate goal, both from a clinical and a regulatory stand-
point,26 drug therapies for NASH should ideally impede
fibrogenesis, either directly or indirectly, as a consequence
of clearing steatohepatitis. Fibrosis reduction has been an
elusive goal so far,11,32 but recently, a randomized trial of
obeticholic acid reported a reduction in fibrosis stage over
18 months of therapy in NASH patients.21 The GOLDEN-
505 trial was shorter and not designed for anti-fibrotic
end points. It provided the proof-of-principle that resolu-
tion of steatohepatitis can result in improvement of
fibrosis, an indirect anti-fibrotic effect. Responders for the
primary end point, at the 120-mg elafibranor dose, expe-
rienced a significant reduction in fibrosis, which was not
seen in the overall group of treated patients. Whether a
direct anti-fibrotic potency of elafibranor, reported in
experimental murine models of fibrosis,16 can be repro-
duced in humans deserves specific testing in longer trials.
Future phase 3 trials will evaluate the effect of elafibranor
on the rate of progression to cirrhosis as a result of the
resolution of NASH or also through a direct anti-fibrotic
effect.
An equally important aspect when treating patients with
NASH is the requirement for absence of deterioration (or at
best improvement) of the cardiometabolic comorbidities
that contribute to overall mortality.25,26 In addition, insulin
resistance, an almost constant feature of NASH, could be
causally related to the hepatic buildup of fat, induction of
lipotoxic compounds within the liver, and systemic and
adipose
tissue
inflammation.
All
of
these
pathways
contribute to liver injury and fibrosis and, therefore,
improving insulin sensitivity could also have beneficial
effects on hepatic damage, as trials of pioglitazone have
shown.9–11 As expected from earlier phase 2 studies,17,18
including a hyperinsulinemic�euglycemic clamp study in
insulin-resistant patients, elafibranor improved markers of
insulin resistance, such as the HOMA-IR index, hyper-
insulinemia, and free fatty acids, and also significantly
reduced HbA1c in diabetics, which reflects improved gly-
cemic control. The pro-atherogenic lipid profile of NASH
patients was also improved with significant reductions of
total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and increases
in HDL cholesterol at both elafibranor doses. Remarkably,
the improvements in glycemic and lipid parameters were
achieved in patients already treated with conventional
glucose and lipid-lowering therapies, which suggests an
additional, direct effect of PPARa/d agonism. It is interesting
to note that contrary to placebo-induced resolution of NASH,
patients that met the primary end point on elafibranor also
exhibited a greater degree of improvement of metabolic and
inflammatory parameters than nonresponders. The tempo-
ral interaction and dose dependency between the metabolic
effects and the histologic response of elafibranor remains to
be elucidated in larger trials.
Elafibranor showed a very good tolerability and safety
profile throughout the 1-year exposure in this trial. This is
of paramount importance, as NASH therapies are expected
to be taken on a long-term basis. In addition, these patients
often have asymptomatic liver disease and are therefore
less willing to tolerate drug-induced side effects in the long
term. There was a mild, isolated, and reversible increase in
creatinine levels in some patients, and longer post-
treatment follow-up is necessary to confirm the revers-
ibility of this biologic effect. PPARa agonists, such as
fenofibrate, are known to induce reversible increases in
serum creatinine without promoting renal failure, as a
result of a pharmacodynamic effect.33–35 The mechanisms
are not entirely known, but might involve increased skel-
etal muscle production. An improvement in renal function
upon fibrate treatment has been reported in a meta-anal-
ysis36 that described a reduction in albuminuria progres-
sion. Here, the increase in creatinine was lower than that
observed with fenofibrate (7.1% with 120 mg elafibranor
vs 17.2% with fenofibrate; a >20% increase in half of the
treated population from the ACCORD [Action to Control
Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes] trial34). However, the
absence of an adverse effect of elafibranor on renal func-
tion in patients with NASH should be confirmed in larger
trials.
This trial has several other strengths and some limita-
tions. The rigorous centralized pathologic reading for both
inclusion and end-of-treatment biopsies avoided inclusion
of patients without clearly defined NASH,24 and provided
uniformity and lack of inter-observer variability for the
assessment of histologic end points. The proportion of
screen failures for histology was low, thus ensuring that
included patients were representative of most real-life
NASH patients seen in tertiary centers. Likewise, the low
proportion of missing end-of-treatment biopsies minimized
1156 Ratziu et al
Gastroenterology Vol. 150, No. 5
CLINICAL LIVER
 potential biases due to patient retention. Another strength is
that this was the first large, international, multicenter
trial in NASH. However, there were also methodologic lim-
itations. The staggered design of the trial could have
resulted in unequal access to the 3 treatment arms, as the
randomization sequence was not set upfront for the 3 arms.
The competitive recruitment resulted in a variable number
of included patients in each center and in an uneven dis-
tribution between treatment arms that contributed to a
significant center effect. Finally, the inclusion of patients
with mild steatohepatitis (bNAS 3) might have blunted the
effect of elafibranor in the overall ITT population, as it
resulted in a high placebo response rate. Nonetheless, the
size of the trial allowed exploratory subgroup analyses that
strengthened the demonstration of efficacy. Although sec-
ondary analyses are to be considered with caution, this was
not a registration, phase 3 trial, but a proof-of-concept,
phase 2b exploratory trial designed to inform the design
of subsequent, larger, pivotal studies.
The results of this trial compare favorably with results of
other investigational agents tested in comparable trials. For
instance in the FLINT (Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR) Ligand
Obeticholic Acid in NASH Treatment) trial, obeticholic acid
induced resolution of NASH in 22% of patients vs 13% in
the placebo group. The difference became significant in a
post-hoc analysis of the subset of patients with well-defined
steatohepatitis
at
baseline:
19%
vs
8%,
respectively
(P < .05). These rates of response are very close to those
obtained in the current trial in the ITT population and in the
subset with NAS � 4 (all FLINT participants had an NAS �
4). In post-hoc analyses from the subgroup of patients with
well-defined NASH in the PIVENS (Pioglitazone vs Vitamin E
vs Placebo for Treatment of Non-Diabetic Patients With
Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis) trial, pioglitazone induced
resolution of steatohepatitis in 47% of patients (21% for
placebo; P ¼ .001) and vitamin E in 36% (P ¼ .05). Direct
comparisons between molecules are misleading in the
absence of head-to-head trials, and because of differences in
inclusion criteria and in definitions of histologic response.
Importantly, a detailed definition of “resolution of steato-
hepatitis” is not available from FLINT or PIVENS. In addi-
tion,
there
was
no
requirement
for
the
absence
of
“worsening of fibrosis” when defining resolution of NASH as
an end point for either PIVENS or FLINT, which further
limits comparisons between rates of response with the
GOLDEN-505 trial. Only large, phase 3 trials will provide
reliable estimates of treatment response for obeticholic acid
and elafibranor, but what is clear so far is that a majority of
patients are nonresponders and that additional pharmaco-
logic strategies will be necessary to optimize the response
rate.
In conclusion, this randomized controlled trial pro-
vides evidence that pharmacologic modulation of the
PPARa/d nuclear receptors results in substantial histologic
improvement in NASH, including resolution of steatohepa-
titis and improvement of the cardiometabolic risk profile,
with a favorable safety profile. Larger phase 3 trials of ela-
fibranor in the target population of patients with moderate
to severe NASH are warranted.
