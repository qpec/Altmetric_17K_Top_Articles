In Brief
Koyano et al. report a laminar microcircuit
for memory retrieval in monkey temporal
cortex. L5 neurons initiated cue-to-target
conversion in cued recall, which was
followed by emergence of a synchronized
cell assembly in L6 that exclusively
encoded to-be-recalled objects for
cortical output.

SUMMARY
The cerebral cortex computes through the canonical
microcircuit that connects six stacked layers; how-
ever, how cortical processing streams
operate
in vivo, particularly in the higher association cortex,
remains elusive. By developing a novel MRI-assisted
procedure that reliably localizes recorded single neu-
rons at resolution of six individual layers in monkey
temporal cortex, we show that transformation of
representations from a cued object to a to-be-re-
called object occurs at the infragranular layer in a
visual cued-recall task. This cue-to-target conver-
sion started in layer 5 and was followed by layer 6.
Finally, a subset of layer 6 neurons exclusively en-
coding the sought target became phase-locked to
surrounding field potentials at theta frequency, sug-
gesting that this coordinated cell assembly imple-
ments cortical long-distance outputs of the recalled
target. Thus, this study proposes a link from local
computation spanning laminar modules of the tem-
poral cortex to the brain-wide network for memory
retrieval in primates.
INTRODUCTION
The cerebral cortex consists of six stacked layers (layers I–VI,
L1–L6), each of which is endowed with unique combinations
of cell types, intra-/inter-laminar connections, and long-range
input/output with other brain regions (Douglas and Martin,
2004; Gilbert and Li, 2013; Reid and Alonso, 1996). Information
that arrives at the cortex is processed by a local circuit that tra-
verses the six layers (often called the ‘‘canonical’’ microcircuit)
(Douglas and Martin, 2004). In the canonical microcircuit, this
process advances in steps from the granular layer to the supra-
granular layer, and then to the infragranular layer, which is ubiq-
uitously observed across almost every cortical area examined.
Laminar differences in neural coding have been examined
mostly in primary sensory cortices (Gilbert and Li, 2013; Reid
and Alonso, 1996); however, it remains elusive whether and
how different layers of the higher association cortex implement
the computation for distinct steps of high-level cognition such
as memory and attention (Godlove et al., 2014; Kaliukhovich
and Vogels, 2012; Logothetis and Sheinberg, 1996; Maunsell
and Newsome, 1987; Miyashita, 2004; Sargolini et al., 2006;
Tsao and Livingstone, 2008).
Converging evidence from neuropsychological and neuroi-
maging studies in humans and non-human primates has
suggested that the temporal association cortex implements
neuronal mechanisms for retrieval of visual long-term memory
(Albright, 2012; D’Esposito and Postle, 2015; Miyashita, 2004;
Ranganath and Ritchey, 2012; Squire et al., 2004). In the cued-
recall paradigm widely used in memory retrieval studies, it is
well known that the presented cue and/or to-be-recalled target
are represented in area 36 (A36; Figure 1A) of the monkey tem-
poral cortex, a crucial region for visual long-term memory, as
originally demonstrated by single-unit recordings (Messinger
et al., 2001; Miyashita, 1988, 2004; Sakai and Miyashita, 1991)
and lesion experiments (Higuchi and Miyashita, 1996; Murray
et al., 1993). Toward understanding for intracortical processing
in this area, translaminar signal flows have been identified during
cue presentation and subsequent delay (Takeuchi et al., 2011);
however, neither the anatomical identity of the flows at six-layer
resolution nor signal contents at the source and target layers has
been revealed. A key question is whether different types of mem-
ory-related neurons are situated in distinct layers (laminar mod-
ule model; Figure 1B) or distributed throughout cortical layers
(non-laminar functional model; Figure 1B). If the former model
is true, it would be necessary to elucidate in which layer the neu-
rons were coding for the presented cue and/or to-be-recalled
target and how the representation for to-be-recalled target
emerges through the interaction among layers. If the latter model
is true, it would be necessary to elucidate how a neuronal popu-
lation distributed across cortical layers can form a functional
cluster.
A crucial obstacle to addressing these queries has been the
lack of techniques to reliably localize recorded single neurons

 at six-laminar resolution in each microelectrode penetration
with task-trained monkeys. Conventional techniques used for
acute experiments on the primary sensory cortices of anesthe-
tized animals, e.g., lesion marking on each electrode penetra-
tion, are difficult to apply to chronic experiments on the associ-
ation cortices of task-trained primates because the marks on
individual penetrations do not remain for months to years. In
the present study, we overcame this obstacle by developing a
novel MRI-based microelectrode-tip localization procedure in
task-trained monkeys that enabled identification of both func-
tions and laminar positions of all recorded neurons in each elec-
trode penetration. We then applied this procedure to reveal
laminar module cascades for object memory retrieval in the
temporal cortex.
RESULTS
We conducted the MRI-assisted single-unit recording in mon-
keys performing an object-object association memory task (Hir-
abayashi et al., 2013a; Naya et al., 2003; Takeda et al., 2015;
Takeuchi et al., 2011) (Figure 1B). In every recording track, the
microelectrode tip position was localized on high-resolution
structural MR images by enhancing the detectability of the
microelectrode tip (Matsui et al., 2007) that is otherwise invisible
on conventional MRI (150-mm in-plane resolution; Figure 1C, left
column, and Figures S1A–S1C, available online). The locations of
recorded neurons were reconstructed in the MRI volume by
referring to the locations of the microelectrode tip on each
recording track. This reconstruction procedure in the MRI
volume is similar to the conventional procedure in acute
experiments in which the locations of the recorded neurons
were reconstructed on histological sections by referring to the lo-
cations of the electrolytic lesion mark on each recording track
(Hubel and Wiesel, 1965, 1977) (see Experimental Procedures,
‘‘Reconstruction of Microelectrode Tracks and Cell Locations
on the MRI Volume’’). Then the positions of the recorded neurons
in the MRI volume were registered onto the postmortem histo-
logical volume by aligning both of these volumes (Yang et al.,
2012) with the aid of metal deposit marks that served as common
references visible in both the MRI volume and the histological
volume (Koyano et al., 2011) (Figure 1C, right column, and Fig-
ures 1D, S1D–S1G, and S1I–S1K) (see Experimental Proced-
ures, ‘‘Localization of Recorded Neurons in Individual Cortical
Layers’’). In this way, the location of neurons in cortical layers
was identified based on the laminar architecture visible in the his-
tological volume.
Object Coding Dynamics of Single Neurons in Each
Cortical Layer
In total, 2,825 single units were recorded from three hemispheres
of two monkeys. As described previously (Naya et al., 2003;
Yoshida et al., 2003), a spatially limited patch of neurons re-
sponding to the learned visual stimuli was found in each hemi-
sphere of the rostrolateral A36 (Figure S2). Within these
patches, the laminar locations of 657 neurons were identified.
Reconstruction errors estimated using lesion marks were small
enough to identify the cortical layer to which a given neuron
belonged (�45.8 ± 79.8, �14.2 ± 84.4, and �54.5 ± 47.5 mm
[mean ± SD] in the anteroposterior, lateromedial, and dorsoven-
tral directions, respectively) (Figure S1H). Indeed, the assign-
ment of laminar positions for 86.1% ± 1.2% (mean ± SD) of neu-
rons was not affected, even when the 3D spatial reconstruction
errors were taken into account (Table S1). Of the layer-identified
neurons, 398 neurons exhibited stimulus-selective visual re-
sponses (p < 0.01, one-way ANOVA; Figure S3).
Responses and laminar locations of representative neurons
are shown in Figure 2. For each electrode penetration, MR im-
ages of the electrode tip were acquired at two (Figures 2A and
2B) or one (Figures 2C–2E) depth locations. In addition to a tonic
response to the optimal stimulus, the L5 neurons also showed a
tonic response when the paired associate of the optimal stimulus
was presented as a cue (Figures 2B and 2D), thus indicating
neuronal coding of learned object-object association memory
(Hirabayashi and Miyashita, 2014; Hirabayashi et al., 2013a;
Miyashita, 2004; Naya et al., 2003). By contrast, responses of
L6 neurons to the paired associate increased at the middle of
the delay period and were maintained until choice stimuli were
presented (Figures 2A–2C). Unlike the infragranular neurons, re-
sponses of L3 neurons were correlated more strongly with cue
stimuli than with target stimuli throughout the cue and delay pe-
riods (Figures 2A and 2E). For each neuron, neuronal coding of
memory representation was quantified with the dynamics of
the indices that extracted the response components coding for
the presented cue (cue-holding index, CHI) and the sought target
(pair-recall index, PRI) (Figures 2A and 2B, right column, and Fig-
ures 2C–2E, second column from the left; Experimental Proced-
ures). Laminar difference of memory coding was then quantita-
tively examined at the neuronal population level.
Memory Retrieval Signal Appeared Only in L5 and L6
We found differential dynamics for cue- and target-stimulus
coding in distinct layers (Figures 3A–3D; see also Figure S4A).
In addition to the stimulus-selective visual response in the cue
processing. In a ‘‘non-laminar functional model,’’ each type of functional neuron is distributed throughout cortical layers, leading to a non-laminar (salt-and-
pepper) functional cluster. Parameters for the behavioral task are also shown in the bottom row.
(C) Localization procedure of recorded neurons at the resolution of six cortical layers. In ‘‘MRI-based in vivo localization’’ of recorded neurons in each recording
track (left column), the microelectrode tip position was localized in MRI scan sessions and the locations of recorded neurons were reconstructed in the MRI
volume by referring to the locations of the microelectrode tip (Figure S1C). After completion of all the recordings, the neurons in the MRI volume were registered
onto the postmortem histological volume by aligning both of these volumes with the aid of metal deposit marks that served as common references visible in both
the MRI volume and the histological volume (right column; Figure S1D). Black dot, recorded neuron; red cross and arrowhead, electrode tip; yellow dot and
arrowhead, elgiloy-deposit fiducial mark.
(D) Representative reconstruction of laminar locations of recorded neurons. The electrode tip on the MR images (top panel), as well as location of recorded
neurons, is registered to a Nissl-stained histological section (bottom panel). Elgiloy-deposit marks are visible both in the MR image (top panel) and a histological
section (bottom panel). The framed area in the top panel indicates the position of the bottom panel. Scale bars, 5 (top) and 1 mm (bottom). See also Figures S1–S3

 period, neurons in all layers showed significant CHI during the
delay period (Figure 3E, left column; p < 0.001, two-tailed paired
t test against zero with Bonferroni’s correction), with L5 showing
the highest value (p < 0.01, post hoc Tukey’s test after one-way
ANOVA), which was also reflected in the relative number of neu-
rons with significant CHI (Figure 3F, left column; p < 0.001, resid-
ual test after c2 test). By contrast, the PRIs in L5 and L6 were
significant during the delay (Figure 3E, column second from the
right; p < 0.001) and were higher than those in other layers (p <
0.02), which was also reflected in the relative number of neurons
with significant PRI (Figure 3F, column second from the right; p <
0.001 for L5 and p < 0.03 for L6). This indicated an overlap in
mnemonic functional properties between L5 and L6 neurons:
only L5 and L6 encoded recalled target information during the
delay period. The laminar characteristics of these mnemonic
codings were observed more directly in the comparisons be-
tween CHI and PRI for each neuron (Figures 3D–3F, right col-
umn); while CHI was significantly larger than PRI for neurons in
L2, L3, and L4 (Figure 3E, right column; p < 0.05 for L2 and L4,
p < 0.001 for L3), the opposite was true in L6 (p < 0.05). In L5,
CHI was balanced with PRI in individual neurons (p = 0.52).
Correspondingly, the relative number of neurons showing higher
CHI than PRI was significantly greater in L3 than in other layers,
and the opposite was true for L6 (Figure 3F, right column; p <
0.001). These results were unchanged even when the recon-
struction error for layer assignment of recorded neurons was
taken into account (Figure S4B) or when the data from individual
monkeys were separately examined (Figures S4C–S4F; see also
Figure S4G). Thus, these results support the laminar module hy-
pothesis (Figure 1B), in which target information in cued recall is
exclusively represented by the infragranular laminar module.
Differential Memory Recall Dynamics in L5 and L6
Within the infragranular layer, L5 and L6 have different cytoarch-
itectonic and cytochemical structures (Douglas and Martin,
2004; Saleem et al., 2007; Suzuki and Amaral, 2003) (Figure 4A),
suggesting distinct functional roles of the two layers. Though
target representation was observed in both L5 and L6 during
the delay period, it is noteworthy that target-representing activity
was already clearly seen during the cue period in L5 (Figure 3E,
second column from the left; p < 0.0001), but much less in L6
(p = 0.049). We thus further investigated whether the cued recall
proceeded in steps from L5 to L6. Comparison of the PRI onset
latency between L5 and L6 showed that the recall process
occurred significantly earlier in L5 (Figures 4B and 4C, left col-
umn; p < 0.05, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). In L5, PRI started to
increase in the middle of the cue period (Figure 4B), with
33.3% of L5 neurons showing onset latencies shorter than
150 ms (Figure 4C), suggesting a feedforward origin of the
sought target coding (Hirabayashi et al., 2013a; Naya et al.,
2003). The cue-related information was also represented differ-
entially in L5 and L6; in L6, CHI remained significant for a shorter
time period than it did in L5 (Figures 4B and 4C, right column; p <
0.005, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test).
Recall Target Representation in Phase-Locked L6 Cell
Assembly
Further examination of the dynamics of mnemonic representa-
tion showed that L6 neurons, but not L5 neurons, were segre-
gated into two functionally distinct populations by a cluster anal-
ysis (Figure 5A); the number of clusters was assessed by the
upper-tail rule (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures for
details; see also Figures S5A and S5I–S5O for the results of addi-
tional analyses for clustering). One group of L6 neurons exhibited
a prominently slower increase in the coding of the sought target,
with a faster decrease in the coding of the presented cue (‘‘late’’
group) compared with the other group of L6 neurons (‘‘early’’
group) (Figures S5B–S5D). The PRI latency lagged the CHI fall
time in L6 late group, while the opposite was true in L5 and L6
early group (Figure 5B), suggesting that the late group in L6
was different from L5 and the early group in L6 in terms of the
time course of stimulus coding. The early and late groups in L6
appeared intermingled across the cortical depth (Figures S5E
and S5F), suggesting functional segregation of these neurons in-
dependent of possible anatomical sub-laminations within L6.
These results raised a possibility that one or both of the two
groups of L6 neurons might exhibit distinct coordination in their
firings, such that the neuronal groups would constitute separate
‘‘non-laminar’’ functional clusters. To test this possibility, we
compared the phase-locking of spike firing to the local field po-
tentials (LFPs) (Figures 5C and 5D). Across the neuronal groups
in the infragranular layer, only the late group in L6 showed
increased phase-locking to the LFP in the theta frequency range
(5–8 Hz) during the delay period compared with the fixation
period (Figure 5E; p < 0.005, two-tailed paired t test against
zero with Bonferroni’s correction; Figures S5G and S5H).
DISCUSSION
In the present study, by developing a novel MRI-assisted
approach that reliably localizes recorded single neurons at
laminar resolution in task-trained monkeys, we provided evi-
dence that supports the ‘‘laminar module’’ hypothesis in mne-
monic processing in the higher-association cortex of monkeys
(Figure 1B). We found that transformation of representations
from a cued visual object to a to-be-recalled object occurs at

 the stage of the infragranular layer, but not the supragranular
layer, of the temporal cortex in a visual cued-recall task. The pre-
sent results suggest a recall circuit in the temporal cortex (Fig-
ure 5F): in the circuit, L5 neurons as a population implement
the coding of both cue and target information during retrieval
and thus represent the relevant ‘‘pair’’ of objects in the trial,
whereas a subset of L6 neurons (late group) implement the
more exclusive coding of the retrieved target and thus most
unambiguously represented the behaviorally relevant sought
target. The L6 neurons in the late group exhibited cooperative
firing with other neurons in the same group, suggesting a func-
tionally distinct module in the processing of associative memory
retrieval. Because the latency of recall signal was much shorter in
L5 than L6, there would be directional information flow from L5 to
L6, which carries the signal of the sought target.
To the best of our knowledge, the present MRI-based method
combined with histological layer identification is the first to allow
reliable laminar localization of all recorded neurons in behaving
primates, even within a small cortical patch (Freiwald and
Tsao, 2010; Moeller et al., 2008) of task-related neurons. In the
primary sensory areas as well, laminar localization of recorded
neurons provides indispensable knowledge for revealing intra-
cortical information processing, and has been extensively inves-
tigated through acute experiments. In these acute experiments,
as typically shown by Hubel and Wiesel (Hubel and Wiesel, 1965,
1977), the electrolytic-lesioning/dye-marking approach can
identify all the locations of recorded neurons if lesioning or
marking is performed in each electrode track. However, it is
not straightforward to extend such a conventional approach to

chronic recording experiments in task-
trained monkeys for the following three
reasons. First, in most chronic experi-
ments, neuronal activities are recorded
from many electrode tracks in a cortical
area,
typically
in
a
spatially
limited
(�3 mm in diameter) functional patch of
task-related neurons, such as a face
patch (Freiwald and Tsao, 2010; Lafer-
Sousa and Conway, 2013; Moeller et al.,
2008). Thus, if electrolytic lesioning/dye
marking is applied in every electrode track, it is practically
impossible to reconstruct all tracks solely based on histology.
Second, if lesion/dye marks are placed at such high density
within a patch, tissue damage would be non-negligible. Third,
an electrolytic lesion mark is identifiable only for an order of
weeks after lesioning, whereas neuronal activities in task-trained
monkeys are usually recorded for months to years. Therefore,
histological reconstruction errors become substantial in the
case of neurons that were recorded long before making lesions
(Koyano et al., 2011). Although elgiloy-deposit marks survive
longer than electrolytic lesion marks (Suzuki and Azuma, 1987),
recording efficiency of elgiloy microelectrodes, particularly
signal to noise ratio, is limited compared to that of more conven-
tional tungsten microelectrodes (Koyano et al., 2011). All of these
difficulties were overcome by the MRI-based in vivo 3D elec-
trode tip localization method in the present study.
Multiple visualizations of the microelectrode tip per penetra-
tion are beneficial in cases where it is difficult for an electrode
to penetrate perpendicular to the cortical layers. For example,
a brain region near a sulcus has complicated structures, and
the angle between the electrode and the cortical layers depends
on the distance from the sulcus. In this case, multiple visualiza-
tions could contribute to precise reconstruction of the location
of recording site along a penetration. By contrast, a single visu-
alization per penetration is applicable to brain regions where it is
easy for an electrode to penetrate perpendicular to the cortical
layers, such as brain regions located at the cortical surface. In
this case, once the first MRI scan is done, then the depth will
be quite well controlled by the scale of the microdrive.

 On the other hand, a current source density (CSD) analysis
with a linear-array multi-channel electrode has been recently es-
tablished as a powerful approach to identify the laminar pattern
of neuronal responses in chronic experiments with task-trained
animals (Takeuchi et al., 2011). The CSD method provides solid
physiological evidence for the location of the cortical layer that
receives a strong bottom-up input, typically L4 (Buffalo et al.,
2011; Haegens et al., 2015; Hansen et al., 2012; Komban
et al., 2014; Maier et al., 2011; Mitzdorf, 1985; Nicholson and
Freeman, 1975). However, CSD signals that are observed in
other layers under task-performing conditions are usually
weaker and broader in distribution than those in L4, and thus
have been only rarely used to identify layers other than L4 (see
Godlove et al., 2014 for its careful application to the agranular
cortex, SEF). Therefore, while the CSD method has been suc-
cessfully applied to identify the location of L4 in order to disso-
ciate the supra- and infra-granular layers (Takeuchi et al.,
2011), no definitive way has been provided to resolve other
cortical layers for each recorded neuron; e.g., L5 cannot be
resolved from L6. In contrast, the present approach using MRI
can be a powerful method for identifying individual cortical layers
other than L4. However, the CSD is still beneficial to determine
the depth location of recording sites at the resolution of deep/up-
per layers when the target brain region was located at the cortical
surface and the electrode could penetrate perpendicular to the
cortical layers.
Functional laminar organization has been examined in the pri-
mary sensory/motor cortices (Alonso and Martinez, 1998; de
Kock et al., 2007; Hubel and Wiesel, 1965, 1977; Jin et al.,
2011; Martinez et al., 2005; Masamizu et al., 2014; Sakata and
Harris, 2009; Self et al., 2013; Spaak et al., 2012). Most studies
consistently showed that the neuronal signal flow proceeds
from the granular layer to the supragranular layer and then to
the infragranular layer (the so-called canonical microcircuit)
and that sensory coding develops through this microcircuit
from the granular to the supragranular layer (e.g., the simple
receptive field to the complex receptive field in the primary visual
area), while, recently, other signal flow from the thalamus directly
to the infragranular layer was identified (Constantinople and
Bruno, 2013). It was thus unexpected that memory-retrieval ac-
tivities emerged abruptly in the infragranular layer, instead of
more gradual development of the coding, through the above ca-
nonical stream. Though unexpected, this observation is quite
robust (Figures 3E and 3F, column second from the right) and
it remained highly significant even when the potential recon-
struction error for layer assignment of recorded neurons was
taken into account (Figure S4B, column second from the right).
It should also be noted that this transformation of neuronal
coding from a cued object to a to-be-recalled object cannot be
interpreted simply as an ‘‘added complexity of receptive field
property,’’ as is found in the primary visual area. Although the
mechanisms of emergence of recall activities are to be further
investigated, the present results also indicated that both the neu-
rons coding for the presented cue and/or the to-be-recalled
target were co-localized in the infragranular layer, particularly
in L5. Accordingly, we suggest that this co-localization provides
a local network environment for cell-to-cell interactions from
cue-coding cells to target-coding cells, which would be a crucial
computational step toward the retrieval of associative object
memory. Indeed, such local cell-to-cell interactions were identi-
fied and suggested as a microcircuit mechanism underlying the
cue-to-target conversion in our previous study (Hirabayashi
et al., 2013a).
Compared with other cortical layers, the functional coding
properties of L6 neurons are less well understood (Thomson,
2010) except for several seminal works: Bolz and Gilbert (Bolz
and Gilbert, 1986) demonstrated that end inhibition in L4 as
well as L2/3 was generated intracortically by L6 neurons in cat
V1. Recently, Olsen et al. (Olsen et al., 2012) found that L6 excit-
atory neurons in mouse V1 controlled the gain of visually evoked
activity in neurons of the upper layers. On the other hand,
regarding the signal flow from L5 to L6, an ‘‘outward bias’’ of
translaminar excitatory connectivity has been identified in slice
preparations (Binzegger et al., 2004; Lefort et al., 2009). Using
CSD analysis, a similar outward signal flow has been found in
the infragranular layer of the monkey temporal cortex in memory
retrieval (Takeuchi et al., 2011). However, neither the functional
significance nor corresponding six-laminar structure of the flow
has been identified. The present results, together with Takeuchi
et al. (2011), suggested not only the signal flow from L5 to L6
in vivo but also the underlying microcircuit by which combined
encodings of both the prior cue and sought target were con-
verted to the distinct coding of the retrieved target that is most
relevant to the task demand. Because the low-frequency coordi-
nation can tolerate the long conduction delays occurring in
neuronal signals traveling a long distance between different
cortical areas (Buzsa
´ ki et al., 2012; Kopell et al., 2000; Liebe
et al., 2012), the low-frequency phase-locked L6 neurons (L6

 neurons in the late group) could subsequently broadcast the
retrieved target to distant cortical areas (Figure 5F), possibly to
lower-order visual areas, as we found recently (Takeda et al.,
2015). Thus, the late L6 group would contribute to output the
task-relevant signal. Such an interpretation is consistent with
other recent anatomical findings that morphologically distinct
L6 neurons selectively project to distant cortical areas (Harris
and Shepherd, 2015; Markov et al., 2014; Ve
´ lez-Fort et al.,
2014). The present results thus open a new window linking the
cortical computation of cued recall in local laminar circuits with
the brain-wide network in primates.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Two male macaque monkeys (Macaca mulatta) weighing 7.9–9.3 kg were used
in this study. MRI-compatible head holders and recording chambers targeting
A36 were attached to the skull under aseptic conditions and general anes-
thesia (Hirabayashi et al., 2013a; Takeda et al., 2015; Takeuchi et al., 2011).
All the experimental protocols were in full compliance with guidelines of the
University of Tokyo and NIH as well as other guidelines for primate research.
The experimental protocol was approved by the University of Tokyo School
of Medicine Animal Care and Use Committee (permission number, MED:
P11-098). Details of the experimental procedures are described in Supple-
mental Experimental Procedures.
Behavioral Task and MRI
Monkeys were trained to perform an object-object pair-association task (Fig-
ure 1B), which requires formation and retrieval of the long-term associative
memory between visual objects (Hirabayashi et al., 2013a, 2013b, 2014; Naka-
hara et al., 2016; Naya et al., 2003; Takeda et al., 2005). Twenty-four mono-
chrome Fourier descriptors were paired arbitrarily into twelve pairs and used
as visual stimuli. Eye position was continuously monitored with an infrared
eye-tracking system (sampling rate, 60 Hz), and monkeys were required to
maintain their gaze throughout the trial.
MR images were acquired with a 4.7-T MRI scanner (Biospec 47/40, Bruker)
using an actively decoupled surface receive coil with a diameter of 50 mm. T2-
weighted fast spin-echo (FSE) sequence was performed to acquire high-reso-
lution structural images.
Pre-implant Targeting of Selective Neuron Cluster
To determine the location of a dense cluster of stimulus-selective neurons in
A36 (hot spot; Naya et al., 2003; Yoshida et al., 2003), we first mapped A36
by recording neuronal activities extracellularly as previously described (Naya
et al., 2003; Yoshida et al., 2003). The location of each electrode track was
measured on an X-ray image (Aggleton and Passingham, 1981; Koyano
et al., 2011; Naya et al., 2003; Takeda et al., 2015; Takeuchi et al., 2011) in
these pre-implant recording sessions. After identifying the hot-spot location,
we inserted an elgiloy microelectrode around the hot spot and placed MRI/his-
tology dual-detectable elgiloy-deposit fiducial marks (Koyano et al., 2011) by
passing an anodic direct current from the electrode tip (2 mA for 3–5 min) to
make common reference markers on both MR images and histological sec-
tions. After the deposition of the elgiloy-deposit marks, their in vivo locations
were examined by MRI (Koyano et al., 2011) (‘‘template 3D MRI volume’’; in-
plane resolution, 150 3 150 mm2).
MRI-Assisted Single-Unit Recording with Semi-chronic Implantation
To record single-unit activities and localize the position of recorded neurons,
we semi-chronically implanted a microelectrode and determined its tip posi-
tion with the MRI-based electrode tip localization method that we have devel-
oped (Matsui et al., 2007) (Figures S1A–S1C). At the beginning of each implan-
tation (‘‘recording track’’ in Figure 1C), a microelectrode (Microprobe) was
inserted into the brain by an MRI-compatible screw microdrive manipulator
(Narishige) (Figures S1A and S1B) that precisely held the microelectrode
without significant displacement for several days (Matsui et al., 2007). On
the day of neuronal recording (‘‘recording session’’), single-unit activities
were recorded while the monkeys performed the pair-association task. On
the day of the MRI-based electrode tip localization (‘‘MRI scan session’’),
the monkeys were anesthetized and high-resolution structural MR images
were acquired (‘‘in vivo electrode MRI volume’’; in-plane resolution, 150 3
150 mm2 and 200 3 200 mm2 for coronal and sagittal images, respectively).
During the scanning, the monkey was placed in the prone position with his
head facing forward to make the angle between the microelectrode and the
static magnetic field close to perpendicular (>70�) for localizing the microelec-
trode tip precisely (Matsui et al., 2007). Sets of the recording session and MRI
scan session were repeated on successive days until the microelectrode in a
single recording track reached the bottom of the cortex.
Reconstruction of Microelectrode Tracks and Cell Locations on the
MRI Volume
The positions of recorded neurons in each recording track were registered on
the template 3D MRI volume using the following procedures (Figure S1C).
First, the microelectrode tip position and the elgiloy-deposit mark positions
in the in vivo electrode MRI volume were determined using a Bayesian classi-
fier with the maximum likelihood method (Bezdek et al., 1993) as described
previously (Koyano et al., 2011; Matsui et al., 2007). The in vivo electrode
MRI volume was then aligned with the template 3D MRI volume using rigid-
body transformation based on the elgiloy-deposit mark positions. Finally,
the position of each recorded neuron was reconstructed from the microdrive
readings and the microelectrode tip positions in the template 3D MRI volume
(Figures 1D and S1C), as is the case with the conventional procedure in acute
experiments using electrolytic lesion marks (Gilbert, 1977; Hubel and Wiesel,
1962, 1965, 1977).
Localization of Recorded Neurons in Individual Cortical Layers
To visualize cortical laminar structures, histological sections were prepared
using standard protocols (Koyano et al., 2011; Matsui et al., 2007) after
completion of all the in vivo recording experiments. Briefly, after transcardial
perfusion, the fixed whole brain was scanned by MRI (‘‘postmortem 3D MRI
volume’’; in-plane resolution, 150 3 150 mm2). The brain was then sliced coro-
nally into 40 mm sections as close as the image slicing planes of the MRI vol-
ume. During cryosectioning, four to five fiducial holes were punctured vertical
to the sectioning plane with a 26G needle and were used as a reference of con-
tinuity for reconstructing sections into the 3D volume (Figure S1E). One series
of sections was collected every fourth section (separated by 160 mm) and was
stained with cresyl violet for Nissl to determine laminar and areal borders
(Saleem et al., 2007; Suzuki and Amaral, 2003). The other series of sections
were stained for parvalbumin, SMI-32, and myelin to confirm the boundary be-
tween L5 and L6 (Figure S3A).
The procedure for localizing recorded neurons in cortical layers is illus-
trated in Figure S1D. Briefly, a stack of hemispheric histological sections
was used to determine the plane in the postmortem 3D MRI volume (steps
1–3 in Figure S1D) that corresponded to the histological sectioning plane.
Then a high-resolution histological volume around A36 (‘‘local 3D histology
volume’’) was constructed from histological sections by referring to the post-
mortem 3D MRI volume and fiducial holes that were punctured during cryo-
sectioning (step 4 in Figure S1D). The positions of the recorded neurons were
then transformed from the template 3D MRI volume onto the local 3D histol-
ogy volume using an affine transformation matrix that was calculated by
comparing the positions of the elgiloy-deposit marks between the two vol-
umes (step 5 in Figure S1D). The reconstruction errors were estimated by
comparing the positions of the lesion marks that were registered from each
track to the local 3D histology volume through the registration procedure
and the positions of the lesion marks that were actually found on the histolog-
ical sections.
Data Analysis
Neuronal response data were analyzed with MATLAB (MathWorks). Spike
trains were smoothed by convolution with a Gaussian kernel to obtain spike
density functions for each stimulus (Figure 2). To examine the object coding
properties related to cue and target stimuli (CHI and PRI) (Figure 3) as well
as their temporal dynamics in each layer (Figures 2, 3, and 4), we calculated
response correlation with the cue and target stimuli (Pearson’s correlation

 coefficients). Hierarchical clustering and the spike-LFP phase-locking analysis
were conducted for L5 and L6 neurons (Figure 5).
Details of other data analyses such as spatial distribution of task-related
neurons in the anterior-posterior and lateral-medial axes (Figure S2), response
properties of neurons in each layer (Figure S3), accuracy of layer assignment
(Figure S4), and angular phases between spikes and LFPs (Figure S5) are
described in detail in the figure legends and Supplemental Experimental
Procedures.
