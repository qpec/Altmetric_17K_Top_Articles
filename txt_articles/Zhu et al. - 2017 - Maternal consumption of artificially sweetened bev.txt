Abstract
Background: Artificial sweeteners are widely replacing caloric sweeteners. Data on long-
term impact of artificially sweetened beverage (ASB) consumption during pregnancy on
offspring obesity risk are lacking. We prospectively investigated intake of ASBs and
sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) during pregnancy in relation to offspring growth
through age 7 years among high-risk children born to women with gestational diabetes.
Methods: In a prospective study of 918 mother-singleton child dyads from the Danish
National Birth Cohort, maternal dietary intake was assessed by a food frequency ques-
tionnaire during pregnancy. Offspring body mass index z-scores (BMIZ) and overweight/
obesity status were derived using weight and length/height at birth, 5 and 12 months and
7 years. Linear regression and Poisson regression with robust standard errors were
used, adjusting for major risk factors.
Results: Approximately half of women reported consuming ASBs during pregnancy and
9% consumed daily. Compared to never consumption, daily ASB intake during preg-
nancy was positively associated with offspring large-for-gestational age [adjusted rela-
tive risk (aRR) 1.57; 95% CI: 1.05, 2.35 at birth], BMIZ (adjusted b 0.59; 95% CI: 0.23, 0.96)
and overweight/obesity (aRR 1.93; 95% CI; 1.24, 3.01) at 7 years. Per-serving-per-day

 substitution of ASBs with water during pregnancy was related to a lower overweight/
obesity risk at 7 years (aRR 0.83; 95% CI: 0.76, 0.91), whereas SSB substitution with ASBs
was not related to a lower risk (aRR 1.14; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.31).
Conclusions: Our findings illustrated positive associations between intrauterine expos-
ure to ASBs and birth size and risk of overweight/obesity at 7 years. Data with longer
follow-up are warranted.

Introduction
The global epidemic of childhood obesity remains a growing
public health concern due to its short- and long-term adverse
health sequelae.1,2 Despite the overall plateauing trends in
some countries, the prevalence of more severe forms of obes-
ity continues to increase among certain subgroups.3 In par-
ticular, offspring born to women with gestational diabetes
(GDM), the most common metabolic pregnancy complica-
tion affecting approximately 16% of pregnancies world-
wide,4,5 represent a high-risk phenotype which may serve as
a unique model to study the early origins of obesity.6
Further, accumulating evidence has linked nutritional per-
turbations during pregnancy to fetal development and obes-
ity risk in later life.7 Thus, it is of great clinical and public
health significance to identify modifiable intrauterine dietary
factors which may potentially interrupt the vicious cycle be-
tween maternal pathophysiology and offspring obesity.8
Pregnancy is characterized by an increase in plasma vol-
ume and accretion of amniotic fluid.9 Despite the compensa-
tion by gestational haemodynamic changes, there is an
increased demand in fluid intake. Due to the health concern
related to sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) in the general
population,10 artificially sweetened beverages (ASBs) have
been considered as potential healthier alternatives, although
emerging evidence has suggested the contrary. Specifically,
despite the lack of acute toxicity, accumulating experimental
data in animal models have questioned the advisability of
artificial sweeteners, as evidenced by alterations in the gut
microbiome,11 increase in intestinal glucose absorption12 and
stimulation
of
sweet-taste
receptors.13
However,
epidemiological data on ASB consumption during pregnancy
in relation to offspring longitudinal growth and obesity risk
over life span are limited. To date, only one study has re-
ported a positive association between ASB, but not SSB, con-
sumption during pregnancy with offspring growth at 1
year.14 Longitudinal studies on long-term impact of ASB on
offspring growth beyond infancy are lacking. Further, despite
the possibility of examining the association related to substi-
tuting SSBs or ASBs with other types of beverages in observa-
tional studies,15 no such data are available; this however
might be informative in terms of identifying healthier
alternatives.
To address these critical data gaps, we prospectively
investigated the associations between maternal consump-
tion of ASBs and SSBs during pregnancy, and offspring
growth and risk of overweight/obesity through age 7 years
among high-risk offspring born to pregnancies complicated
by GDM. Furthermore, we examined offspring risk of
overweight/obesity associated with substituting SSBs or
ASBs with an equal serving of alternative beverages (fruit
juices or water) during pregnancy.
Methods
Study population and design
The study data were based on the Danish National Birth
Cohort (DNBC), a longitudinal cohort of 101 042 preg-
nancies (91 827 women) in Denmark (1996–2002).16
Briefly, Danish-speaking pregnant women residing in
Denmark were recruited by general practitioners at the
Key Messages
• Among high-risk children born to women with gestational diabetes, maternal daily consumption of artificially sweet-
ened beverages compared with never consumption during pregnancy was associated with a higher body mass index
z-score and increased risk of overweight/obesity at 7 years.
• Per-serving-per-day substitution of sugar-sweetened beverages with artificially sweetened beverages was not related
to a lower risk of overweight/obesity at 7 years, whereas substitution of artificially sweetened beverages with water
was related to a lower risk.
• Given the widespread use of artificially sweetened beverages, further investigation with longer follow-up beyond
early childhood is warranted.

 first

around

weeks
6–12.
Enrolled participants completed four computer-assisted
telephone interviews at gestational weeks 12 and 30, and 6
and 18 months postpartum, which collected data on socio-
demographic, perinatal and clinical factors. In addition, a
validated food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was admin-
istered at 25 weeks of gestation.17 When the offspring was
7 years old, a follow-up questionnaire about the child’s
health and development was delivered by mail or electron-
ically to the parents. The study was approved by the
Danish National Committee on Biomedical Research
Ethics.
Informed
consent
was
obtained
from
all
participants.
As part of the ongoing Diabetes and Women’s Health
Study,18 we identified 1379 pregnancies complicated by
GDM, documented from the study interviews at 30 weeks
of gestation or 6 months postpartum and/or the Danish
National Patient Registry in the DNBC. The World Health
Organization (WHO) criteria19 or local clinical practices20
were
applied
for
GDM
diagnosis.
We
sequentially
excluded pregnancies with missing dietary data from FFQ
(n ¼ 346),
implausible
daily
energy
intake
(<4000
or >20 000 kJ/day; n ¼ 14), missing data on offspring
growth at birth and all follow-ups (n ¼ 2), multiple gesta-
tions (n ¼ 24), pre-existing diabetes (n ¼ 57) and recurrent
GDM (n ¼ 18), rendering a pool of 918 mother-child dyads
as our analytical sample. At follow-up, we included data
from offspring with complete anthropometric data at birth
(n ¼ 918), 5 months (n ¼ 589), 12 months (n ¼ 575) or
7 years (n ¼ 531) in the final analysis. Maternal and off-
spring characteristics at baseline did not substantially dif-
fer between those lost to follow-up due to missing
offspring anthropometric data and those retained, except
that women lost to any follow-up were more likely to have
a lower socioeconomic status. The mean consumption of
ASBs or SSBs during pregnancy (serving/day) did not differ
between the lost and retained groups.
Exposure assessment
Maternal dietary intakes during pregnancy were assessed
by an FFQ self-administered at 25 weeks of gestation,
which collected information on habitual dietary intake
during the previous month.17 Consumptions of ASBs and
SSBs were determined by reported frequency of sugar-free/
light and sugar-sweetened soft drinks, respectively, with re-
sponse categories ranging from never to � 8 servings/day
(d). Servings of ASBs and SSBs were standardized with the
assumption that one serving was equivalent to 1 cup (250
ml or 261 g).21 Dietary intakes and macronutrient contents
of individual food items were quantified in grams per day
based on standard portion sizes and the Danish Food
Composition Tables version 6.02.22 The FFQ has been
validated against a 7-day weighted food record and several
biomarkers, and demonstrated as a useful instrument for
analyses of energy, food and nutrient levels.23,24 Further, a
randomly selected sample of 103 women completed the
FFQ a second time at 33–35 weeks of gestation. For both
beverage variables, Spearman’s correlation between in-
takes reported in the first and second FFQ was approxi-
mately 0.7.25
Outcome measures
Offspring birthweight and length were extracted from the
Danish Medical Birth Registry. Ponderal index at birth
was calculated as birthweight in kg/birth length in m3.
Large-for-gestational age (LGA) was defined as a birth-
weight greater than the sex- and gestational age-specific
90th percentile based on the entire DNBC population.
During the 6-month postpartum interview, the mother
referred to the Child’s Book and reported child’s weight
and recumbent length measured by the general practitioner
at the 5-month postnatal visit. Similarly, child’s weight
and recumbent length at 12 months were reported during
the 18-month postpartum interview. At the 7-year follow-
up questionnaire, child’s weight and height were reported
by the parent(s) based on measurements obtained by the
general practitioner, school nurse or parent(s). Age- and
sex-specific body mass index z-scores (BMIZ) were calcu-
lated using the WHO Child Growth Standards for children
aged < 5 years26 and WHO Growth Reference for those
aged � 5 years.27 Childhood overweight/obesity was classi-
fied using age- and sex-specific WHO cutoffs [� 85th per-
centile for children aged < 5 years26 and � two standard
deviations (SD) for those aged � 5 years27].
Covariates
A comprehensive list of a priori selected covariates was
considered in the analyses. These include, first, the follow-
ing maternal non-dietary covariates obtained from inter-
views at gestational weeks 12 and 30: maternal age
(continuous), socioeconomic status determined by the
highest familial employment level [high (medium-to-high-
level professionals), middle (skilled workers), low (un-
skilled workers, others)], pre-pregnancy BMI (< 25.0,
25.0–29.9, �30.0 kg/m2; derived from self-reported pre-
pregnancy weight and height), smoking during pregnancy
(yes, no), and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity dur-
ing pregnancy (ever, never). Second, covariates include ma-
ternal dietary covariates from FFQ: intakes of total energy,
desserts and sweets, oil/margarine/butter, potato, pro-
cessed
meat,
refined
grains
and
whole
grains

 continuous). Third, covariates include offspring character-
istics from: the Medical Birth Registry, postpartum 6- and
18-month questionnaires and 7-year follow-up question-
naire
[sex
(male,
female),
breastfeeding
duration � 6
months (yes, no), ASB consumption � 1/week (yes, no),
SSB consumption � 1/week (yes, no) and physical activ-
ity � 2 h/weekday (yes, no) at 7 years]. All models were
mutually adjusted for maternal intake of both beverage
types (ASBs and SSBs) during pregnancy. Given the rela-
tively low frequency of missing values for categorical vari-
ables in the full sample (range 0–4%), we assigned a
separate category for missing values as necessary.
Statistical analysis
Distributions of maternal and offspring characteristics
across ASB or SSB categories were assessed by analysis of
variance (ANOVA) for continuous variables and v2 test for
categorical variables. Multivariable linear regression mod-
els estimated the beta coefficients (b) and 95% confidence
intervals (CIs) for offspring ponderal index at birth and
BMIZ at follow-up in association with maternal ASB or
SSB consumption during pregnancy, after adjustment for
aforementioned covariates. Similarly, Poisson regression
with robust standard errors calculated relative risks (RR)
and 95% CIs for offspring risk of LGA at birth and over-
weight/obesity at follow-up. Further, nonparametric cubic
spline regression examined the association between bever-
age intake on a continuum (in serving/d) and offspring risk
of overweight/obesity. Further, assuming the observed as-
sociation between maternal ASB consumption and off-
spring overweight/obesity reflected a true effect, we used
the substitution regression models28,29 to examine whether
ASBs could serve as healthier alternatives for SSBs. We
also assessed whether substitution of SSBs or ASBs with an
equal serving of alternative beverages (fruit juices or water)
might have any beneficial effect on mitigating offspring
risk of overweight/obesity. Specifically, Poisson regression
estimated adjusted RRs (aRRs) and 95% CIs for the substi-
tution association using the computed difference in b coef-
ficients and variances, and the covariance between the two
beverage types of interest.28
To minimize the potential reverse causality impact, we
performed a priori subgroup analyses by known risk fac-
tors for GDM including maternal pre-pregnancy obesity
status, age and smoking during pregnancy. Further, to
examine the potential effect modification by offspring sex
and early life factors (breastfeeding, diet and physical ac-
tivity), we included a cross-product of the potential modi-
fier and maternal ASB consumption. Accordingly, we
conducted stratified analyses by sex and breastfeeding dur-
ation (<, � 6 months), with a P-for-interaction < 0.20.
To further test the robustness of the findings, we con-
ducted several sensitivity analyses restricted to women
who did not receive medications for GDM treatment
(93%), women without hypertensive complications during
pregnancy (91%) or women who delivered at term (� 37
gestational weeks; 94%), respectively. All analyses were
conducted using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary,
NC).
Results
In total, 45.4% of women reported consuming ASBs dur-
ing pregnancy, with 9.3% consuming ASBs daily; 68.7%
reported consuming SSBs, with 9.2% consuming SSBs
daily (Table 1). Across the increasing maternal ASB catego-
ries, women tended to have a higher pre-pregnancy BMI
and energy density of proteins, but a lower total energy in-
take, glycaemic index and glycaemic load. Maternal SSB
consumption was associated with a younger maternal age
and a lower energy density of proteins, but a higher total
energy, energy density of carbohydrates, and glycaemic
index and load. Offspring characteristics at birth did not
vary by maternal ASB or SSB intake, respectively. Also not-
ably, compared with offspring of women with SSB in-
take � 1/d,
their
counterparts
of
women
with
ASB
intake � 1/d were more likely to be boys (55% vs 44%)
and had a slightly higher mean birthweight (3747.5 g vs
3603.2 g).
After adjusting for major maternal and offspring covari-
ates, daily ASB consumption during pregnancy compared
with never was positively associated with offspring risk of
LGA (aRR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.05–2.35; Figure 1) and over-
weight/obesity at 7 years (aRR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.24–3.01;
Table 2), but not during infancy (Figure 1). Consistently
for continuous growth outcomes, ASB consumption � 1/d
was associated with a 0.59 SD increase (95% CI, 0.23–
0.96) in offspring BMIZ at 7 years (Table 2) but not at ear-
lier ages (Figure 1), except for a marginally significant
0.83 kg/m3 increase (95% CI, �0.04 to 1.70) in ponderal
index at birth (P ¼ 0.06). Further, cubic spline regression
curve illustrated a dose-response relationship between per-
serving-per day consumption of ASBs during pregnancy
and
offspring
overweight/obesity
at
7
years
(Supplementary Figure 1, available as Supplementary data
at IJE online). In contrast, no significant associations were
observed for SSB consumption with offspring growth at
birth, in infancy (Supplementary Figure 2, available as
Supplementary
data
at
IJE
online)
or
at
7
years
(Supplementary Table 1, available as Supplementary data
at IJE online). Notably, per-serving-per-day substitution of
SSBs with ASBs was not associated with a reduced but with
an increased risk of offspring overweight/obesity at 7 years

 sensitivity analyses showed robust results even among
women who did not take any medications for GDM, or
had no hypertensive complications during pregnancy or de-
livered at term (Supplementary Table 3, available as
Supplementary data at IJE online).
Discussion
In this prospective study, daily maternal ASB consumption
during pregnancy compared with never was associated
with a 1.57-fold increase in LGA risk at birth, a 0.59-SD
increase in BMIZ at 7 years and a 1.93-fold increase in
overweight/obesity risk at 7 years after adjustment for
major maternal and offspring risk factors, among high-risk
offspring born to women with GDM. Notably, results re-
mained robust even after adjustment for pre-pregnancy
BMI and other major risk factors of GDM. Furthermore,
substituting one-serving-per-day of SSBs with an equiva-
lent serving of ASBs was not associated with a decreased
risk of offspring overweight/obesity at 7 years, whereas
ASB substitution with water was significantly associated
with a reduced risk.
Our findings are biologically plausible. The high-
intensity artificial sweeteners compared with glucose or
sucrose may exacerbate glucose intolerance at a greater
magnitude via alterations of gut microbiota,11 increase in-
testinal glucose absorption through apical glucose trans-
porter 212 and promote excessive intake and weight gain
via dysregulation of sweet taste and caloric reward.30 Such
maternal metabolic perturbations during the critical devel-
opmental window of gestation may in turn predispose off-
spring to obesity and metabolic disorders in later life.31
Moreover, we observed sex-specific associations of ASB
consumption during pregnancy, with male but not female
offspring risk of overweight/obesity at 7 years. Despite that
the mechanisms underlying the observed sexual dimorph-
ism remain to be elucidated, our findings are consistent
with animal data; male mice exhibited greater weight gain
and decreased insulin sensitivity compared with females in
response to chronic lifetime exposure to aspartame starting
in utero.32 In addition, the metabolic perturbations among
male offspring might be partially attributable to sex-
specific alterations in the gut microbiome,33 which has
been implicated in the artificial sweeteners-induced glucose
tolerance.11 On the other hand, no significant associations
were observed for SSB consumption during pregnancy and
offspring growth herein and previously.14 As observed in
our study and previously,14 women who consumed more
ASBs during pregnancy were different from those who con-
sumed more SSBs in terms of several key characteristics.
Specifically, the former compared with the latter had rela-
tively greater pre-pregnancy BMI but lower total daily
energy intake during pregnancy, suggesting the intention
of women at higher risk for GDM to seek for ‘healthier’ al-
ternatives of SSBs during pregnancy. Since we have ad-
justed for these major risk factors in the multivariable
models, they could be indicators of other unmeasured risk
factors, which could partially contribute to the null find-
ings for SSB consumption. Further, notably, only 9% of
pregnant women reported daily SSB consumption in our
study during 1996–2002, which was remarkably lower
than the consumption of a Canadian pregnant population
(23.4%) in 2009–1214 and a contemporary US non-
pregnant population (59%).34 Therefore, the null findings
for SSBs in the present study could also be partially attrib-
uted to the limited variation in SSB exposure.
To our knowledge, only one study in a Canadian popu-
lation has investigated the associations between maternal
ASB and SSB consumption during pregnancy and offspring
growth at 1 year, with positive associations observed only
for ASBs but not SSBs.14 In the present study, the positive
associations were pronounced at birth and extended to 7
years but not during infancy. The discordant findings in
age-specific associations could be partially attributable to
the difference in the underlying study population and off-
spring growth pattern. Also notably, the validity of using
BMIZ as an indicator of paediatric adiposity in infancy re-
mains debatable.35 Studies with more objective measures
of paediatric adiposity are warranted. Further, our data
suggest that unfavourable early life factors (i.e. suboptimal
breastfeeding duration) may exacerbate the potential ad-
verse effects of intrauterine ASB exposure on childhood
risk of overweight/obesity. It is plausible that the subtle
metabolic alteration due to fetal programming may be-
come more apparent later in life encountered by a second
hit or challenge, resulting in latency between intrauterine
exposure and disease phenotype.36
A major strength of this study is the prospective and
longitudinal follow-up of offspring growth through 7 years
of age. Further, our results are robust against a series of
sensitivity analyses. For instance, to reduce potential con-
founding from pre-pregnancy BMI, we included it in multi-
variable models and observed significant associations even
after its adjustment. Moreover, stratified analysis illus-
trated robust findings; even among non-obese women, ma-
ternal ASB consumption was related to higher offspring
risk of overweight/obesity at 7 years. Notably, our findings
could be of particular relevance to the high-risk population
of GDM women who may be particularly health conscious
and be seeking ‘healthier’ alternatives for SSBs during
pregnancy.
Several potential limitations of the study need to be
noted. First, offspring weight and height at 7 years were re-
ported by parents based on measurements made by general
1506

 practitioner, school nurse or parent(s). Despite the inevit-
able measurement errors, parent-reported and measured
data are highly correlated (height r ¼ 0.942, weight 0.925,
BMI 0.813; P < 0.001).37 Second, loss to follow-up due to
missing offspring anthropometric data may have reduced
statistical power and resulted in a lower proportion of
women from the high-risk group (i.e. low SES group),
which may consequently underestimate the true effect sizes.
Third, estimates from the substitution analyses should be
interpreted with caution due to the underlying assumption
of causality between maternal beverage consumption and
risk of offspring overweight/obesity. Nonetheless, given
that an effective long-term, population-based dietary inter-
vention study to assess the causal relationship would be
costly and pragmatically challenging, such data from inter-
vention studies are lacking and therefore carefully con-
ducted observational studies could serve as a reasonable
approach to assessing the association. Further, our findings
suggest that pregnancy is an important window of suscepti-
bility to ASBs in relation to risk of offspring obesity.
However, notably, despite the richness and uniqueness of
our data, dietary data during pregnancy were collected be-
tween 1996 and 2002. The shifting beverage landscape
with an overall increasing trend of ASB consumption dur-
ing the past decades38,39 necessitates further investigation
using more contemporary data. Moreover, although results
were robust even after additional adjustment of childhood
factors (breastfeeding, and dietary intake and physical ac-
tivity at 7 years), we could not completely rule out the pos-
sibility of residual confounding due to other postnatal
obesogenic risk factors across early childhood (e.g. food
and eating environment, other eating behaviours, and psy-
chosocial factors). Nonetheless, these postnatal factors
could be in the downstream pathway between diet during
pregnancy and offspring outcomes during childhood; ad-
justment for them could underestimate the true effect sizes,
and therefore investigation on their mediating roles may be
warranted to identify potential effect modifiers. Finally, the
study is generalizable to Danish women with GDM and
their children. Future investigations among other high-risk
racial/ethnic groups are warranted.
In conclusion, our study fills the critical data gap in the
literature with a longitudinal follow-up of offspring
growth from birth through age 7 years, among high-risk
offspring born to women with GDM. In this prospective
cohort, higher maternal ASB consumption during preg-
nancy was positively related to LGA at birth and offspring
BMIZ and risk of overweight/obesity at 7 years. Our find-
ings further raise the questionability of promoting ASBs as
‘healthier’ alternatives for SSBs, particularly among high-
risk
pregnant
women.
Future
studies
among
other
populations with longer follow up beyond early childhood
are warranted.
