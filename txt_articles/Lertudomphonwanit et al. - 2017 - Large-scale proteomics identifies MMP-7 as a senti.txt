of epithelial injury and of biliary atresia

Biliary atresia is a progressive infantile cholangiopathy of complex pathogenesis. Although early diagnosis and sur-
gery are the best predictors of treatment response, current diagnostic approaches are imprecise and time-consuming.
We used large-scale, quantitative serum proteomics at the time of diagnosis of biliary atresia and other cholestatic
syndromes (serving as disease controls) to identify biomarkers of disease. In a discovery cohort of 70 subjects, the
lead biomarker was matrixmetalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7), which retained high distinguishing features for biliary atre-
sia in two validation cohorts. Notably, the diagnostic performance reached 95% when MMP-7 was combined with
g-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT), a marker of cholestasis. Using human tissue and an experimental model of biliary
atresia, we found that MMP-7 is primarily expressed by cholangiocytes, released upon epithelial injury, and pro-
motes the experimental disease phenotype. Thus, we propose that serum MMP-7 (alone or in combination with
GGT) is a diagnostic biomarker for biliary atresia and may serve as a therapeutic target.
INTRODUCTION
Diagnostic accuracy and timeliness are critical for therapeutic inter-
ventions that target pathogenesis of diseases. When diseases are
caused by well-defined sequence variants in gene or gene groups,
the use of mutation screening tests simplifies diagnostic algorithms
and allows for the personalization of treatments (1, 2). Unfortunately,
the opportunities for molecular diagnosis or targeted treatments are
limited in diseases of multifactorial etiology and complex pathogenesis
(3, 4). Biliary atresia (BA) is such a disease prototype, with increasing
evidence for viruses, environmental toxins, and susceptibility genes as
etiologic agents, as well as a dysregulated immune response that dis-
rupts the epithelial lining and limits tissue repair (5–8). This rare dis-
ease results from a rapidly progressive inflammatory and fibrosing
injury to extrahepatic bile ducts (EHBDs), which interrupts the flow
of bile and produces severe liver injury in otherwise healthy infants.
With an onset of pathological jaundice limited to a highly reproduc-
ible window in the first 3 to 4 months of life of affected infants, early
diagnosis and surgical intervention are critical for the restoration of
bile flow and improvement in short-term outcome (7, 9, 10). However,
neonatal jaundice is a common sign for several clinical syndromes.
Clinical algorithms have been proposed to differentiate BA from other
causes of neonatal cholestasis (7, 11, 12), but they are imprecise and
have the potential to delay the diagnosis and treatment (12).
Previous studies analyzing the serum and plasma by metabolomics,
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), and microRNA
quantification have yielded potential biomarkers of BA (13–15). How-
ever, the use of small cohorts and the lack of prospective validation in
these studies limit the application of the findings in diagnosis or
screening. Although circulating cytokines [for example, interleukin-2
(IL-2), IL-10, tumor necrosis factor–a (TNF-a), and IL-8] have been
reported to play regulatory roles in pathogenesis of BA, they have not
been shown to reliably differentiate BA from other cholestatic syn-
dromes (16, 17). Here, we report the proteomic analysis of serum
samples at the time of diagnosis of BA, which uncovered high circu-
lating concentrations of matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7) above
those of age-matched disease and healthy controls. After demonstrating
the reproducibility of the findings in two validation cohorts, we ex-
plored the potential role of this marker in the pathogenesis of tissue
injury. We found that MMP-7 is constitutively expressed by normal
cholangiocytes, increases in the serum upon biliary injury, and mod-
ulates the clinical phenotype in an experimental model of BA.
RESULTS
Serum proteomics of BA in a discovery cohort
To search for biomarkers of BA, we applied the slow off-rate modified
aptamer scan (SOMAscan, SomaLogic Inc.) to 70 serum samples from
a discovery cohort of infants at the time of diagnosis of BA (at Kasai
operation,n = 35) and to age-matched infants withneonatal intrahepatic
cholestasis (IHC; n = 35; Fig. 1), as described previously (18). Infants
were enrolled into a prospective study of the National Institute of
Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)–funded Childhood
LiverDiseaseResearchNetwork(ChiLDReN; www.childrennetwork.org;
ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00061828). All groups were age-
matched and had similar levels of hepatocellular injury and cholestasis
(Table 1), except for a higherconcentration of g-glutamyltranspeptidase
(GGT) in infants with BA (P < 0.0001). Of 1129 proteins (table S1),
76 were significantly overexpressed or underexpressed in BA compared
to IHC [false discovery rate (FDR)–adjusted P < 0.05; table S2), with
the top nine differentially expressed proteins shown in Fig. 2.
To explore the potential value of these proteins as biomarkers of
disease, we used multivariable logistic regression analyses and found
that the combination of MMP-7 and ENPP7 distinguished BA from
IHC with area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve
(AUC)of0.99[95%confidenceinterval(CI),0.97to1.00;Fig.3,AandB].
Between the two proteins, MMP-7 alone showed excellent diagnostic

 features, with an AUC of 0.97 (95% CI, 0.93 to
1.00) and a sensitivity of 97% and specificity of
91% at a cutoff probability of 0.49. Taking into ac-
count the relatively low AUC of 0.78 for ENPP7
and the previous reports that serum GGT is gener-
ally higher in infants with BA (19, 20), we next
examined how the combination of serum MMP-7
and GGT (available from the biochemical studies;
n = 29 for BA and 31 for IHC; Fig. 3C) would com-
pare to MMP-7 + ENPP7. Although GGT alone
generated an AUC of 0.9 (95% CI, 0.83 to 0.97;
Fig. 3, B and C), the AUC for MMP-7 + GGT at
0.98 (95% CI, 0.94 to 1.00) was just under the
AUC for MMP-7 + ENPP7 at 0.99 (95% CI, 0.97
to 1.00). Collectively, the data on this discovery co-
hort were preliminary evidence that the combination
of MMP-7 with ENPP7 or GGT had a potentially
high diagnostic accuracy for infants with BA.
Validation of MMP-7 as a biomarker of BA
To test the reproducibility of the high accuracy for
MMP-7, ENPP7, and GGT alone or in combination
in BA, we performed the same SOMAscan assay in
two other independent cohorts separately (Fig. 1).
The first cohort consisted of the same number of
age-matched infants with BA or IHC. To evaluate
assay reproducibility, we included six samples from
the discovery cohort to serve as bridging samples
and found a high correlation (r = 0.9958; 95% CI,
0.9956 to 0.9960) between the two assays. Using
the same analytical approach as in the discovery
cohort, the different combinations of the serum
biomarker and GGT produced lower AUCs than
in the discovery cohort, except for a persistently
high AUC of 0.94 for MMP-7 + GGT (95% CI,
0.88to1.00;Fig.4A).Inthesecondvalidationcohort,

 we performed a SOMAscan assay in 105 age-matched infants with BA
and used the MMP-7 abundance signals and the serum GGT values in
a discriminatory model for BA. Using the cutoff probability from the
discovery cohort to assess the probability of a true positive and a false
negative, the MMP-7 + GGT model showed a sensitivity of 96% to
predict BA (table S3).
On the basis of the reproducibility of the findings in the validation
cohorts, we next examined whether MMP-7 would aid in solving the
clinical conundrum of differentiating BA from syndromes of IHC
with high serum GGT. For this analysis, we hypothesized that serum
MMP-7 maintains high discriminatory features for BA in subjects
with serum GGT > 300 U/liter, a concentration that has been reported
as more frequent in BA (19, 20). For this analysis, we combined all
subjects in the discovery and validation cohort #1 (GGT concentrations
available for 122 subjects), which were classified into groups as follows:
(i)GGT<100U/liter(n=0forBAand n=24forIHC),(ii)GGT=100to
300U/liter(n=10forBAandn= 25forIHC),and(iii)GGT>300U/liter
(n = 50 for BA and n = 13 for IHC). The analysis for group (i) was not
pursued because it contained no infant with BA. For groups (ii) and
(iii), the AUCs for MMP-7 (0.92 and 0.88, respectively), MMP-7 +
ENPP7 (0.91 and 0.93, respectively), and
MMP-7 + GGT (0.93 and 0.88, respec-
tively) were higher than for GGT (0.63
and 0.73, respectively) (Fig. 4B).
Examining the potential use of serum
MMP-7 to diagnose infants with BA, we
calculated the “number needed to mis-
diagnose”(NNM)asameansforestimating
the number of patients assigned with the
correct diagnosis of BA before a mis-
diagnosis occurs (21). The NNM for
MMP-7 was 13.4 (meaning that 1 of 13.4
patientsismisdiagnosed)andforMMP-7+
ENPP7 was 16.67, which were superior to
the NNM of 5.4 for GGT (1 of 5.4 is mis-
diagnosed). Notably, the combination of
MMP-7 + GGT had the best NNM at
19.1. Overall, this estimation emphasized
the benefit of serum MMP-7 (alone or in
combination) over GGT as a diagnostic
aid for BA.
Validation by an
antibody-based assay
To determine whether the high concentra-
tion of MMP-7 could be validated using a
different technology, we obtained serum
aliquots from 10 infants in the discovery
cohort and determined the MMP-7 con-
centration using an antibody-based ELISA.
The direct measurement of MMP-7 was
high for BA and had no overlap with
IHC (Fig. 4C). A comparative plot using
SOMAscan data for the same subjects
showed an even greater separation be-
tween the cohorts (Fig. 4D). Together,
these data confirmed the high accuracy of
MMP-7 + GGT for the diagnosis of BA,
withvalidation in twoindependentcohorts
and demonstration of technical reproducibility using an antibody-
based assay.
Expression of MMP-7 in EHBDs and cholestatic syndromes
Searching for the biological basis of the increased serum concentra-
tions of MMP-7 in BA, we first stained paraffin-embedded sections
of the human liver (normal segment from liver tumor resection),
gallbladder (normal histology after cholecystectomy of adult subject),
and EHBDs (from a stillborn neonate). We focused on these tissues
because of the predominant expression of MMP-7 in the liver and bil-
iary system reported in the Human Protein Atlas (www.proteinatlas.
org/ENSG00000137673-MMP7/tissue). Our immunostaining
showed minimal or no expression of MMP-7 in parenchymal or non-
parenchymal cells of the normal liver. By contrast, the protein was spe-
cifically expressed in the cytoplasm of cholangiocytes along the
epithelium of the gallbladder, EHBD, and the surrounding peribiliary
glands (Fig. 5A).
In liver biopsies obtained at the time of diagnosis of BA, MMP-7
was detected in cholangiocytes of intrahepatic bile ducts (IHBDs) in
most samples, albeit at variable levels, and in a few hematopoietic cells

 within the portal tracts (n = 12; Fig. 5B). A lighter expression pattern
was detected in liver biopsies of infants with a1-antitrypsin deficiency
(n = 6; Fig. 5C) and idiopathic neonatal cholestasis (n = 2), which may
account for the increased serum concentration in IHC above healthy
controls (Fig. 5D). To determine MMP-7 expression at the transcrip-
tional level, we extracted liver mRNA data from the genome-wide ex-
pression data sets for subjects with BA (n = 64), IHC (n = 14), and
normal controls (n = 7), which we published previously and submitted
to the Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE46995) (17). Consistent with
histological findings, livers from BA subjects had higher MMP-7
mRNA expression compared to IHC (fold change relative to normal
controls, 9.98 ± 7.65 versus 2.54 ± 1.73; P < 0.0001; Fig. 5E).The mRNA
expression for GGT in these biopsies was not significantly different
between the groups, revealing a discrepancy at the hepatic transcrip-
tional level when compared to the differences in serum GGT (fig.
S1). Together, these data defined a primary localization of MMP-7
in cholangiocytes of EHBDs, with minimal or no expression in in-
trahepatic cholangiocytes of normal livers and detectable expression
in intrahepatic cholangiocytes of diseased livers (but lower than
the level seen in EHBDs). At the whole tissue level, the total liver
MMP-7 mRNA was still higher in BA when compared to diseased
controls.
Lack of correlation between MMP-7 and fibrosis
To explore the biological properties of MMP-7 in
determining the phenotype of extrahepatic cholangiopa-
thies, we first investigated the relationship between
MMP-7 expression and tissue fibrosis. On the basis of
the well-described role of metalloproteinases in the
turnover and degradation of extracellular matrix and on
the previous reports linking MMP-7 to elastin, E-cadherin,
and syndecan-1 (22–24), we hypothesized that MMP-7 ex-
pression would correlate with the severity of liver fibrosis.
To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the relationship be-
tween serum MMP-7 and histological fibrosis using the
Scheuer fibrosis staging 0 to 4, as described previously
(25). For these experiments, the fibrosis staging was per-
formedindependently by the pathologistsof the ChiLDReN
consortium in liver biopsy samples from the same subjects
with BA whose sera were analyzed by the SOMAscan as-
say. Serum MMP-7 correlated poorly with liver fibrosis
staging at the time of diagnosis (Spearman r = 0.33; 95%
CI, 0.17 to 0.48; P < 0.0001; fig. S2A). Similarly, ROC anal-
ysis showed that serum MMP-7 was a poor predictor of
hepatic fibrosis (AUC, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.78; fig.
S2B). To investigate whether the expression of MMP-7
correlated with fibrosis within the same tissue, we com-
pared the surface area of hepatic fibrosis detected by tri-
chrome staining and of the area immunostained by
MMP-7 (fig. S2C). Again, MMP-7 expression in the liver
had very low correlation with hepatic fibrosis (Spearman
r = 0.25; P = 0.52; fig. S2D). Collectively, these data did not
support a functional role of MMP-7 in modulating the
fibrosing phenotype at the time of diagnosis of BA.
Increase of MMP-7 upon experimental
biliary injury
Without evidence that MMP-7 is linked to hepatic fibrosis
in BA, we next explored whether the protein is involved in
the inflammatory mechanisms that regulate epithelial
injury. On the basis of the proposed role of MMP-7 in activating
the innate immune response to a tissue injury (26),we first determined
whether serum concentrations of MMP-7 increase in neonatal mice
after bile duct epithelial injury induced by rotavirus infection. In this
model, the intraperitoneal administration of 1.5 × 106 fluorescent-
forming units of rhesus rotavirus type-A (RRV) into BALB/c mice
within 24 hours of birth injures the epithelial lining of EHBD, followed
by an inflammatory obstruction of the lumen and atresia (27, 28). As
expected, RRV infection resulted in obstruction of EHBD, jaundice,
growth retardation, and acholic stools; universal mortality occurred
by day 15 of viral challenge (29). Analyzing serum samples collected
7 days after RRV injection (time of the peak of epithelial injury), the
concentration of MMP-7 increased significantly above that of age-
matched, saline-injected controls (2.01 ± 0.39 versus 0.96 ± 0.14 ng/
ml; n = 3 to 4 per group; P = 0.03; Fig. 6A). In the liver, real-time poly-
merase chain reaction (RT-PCR) revealed that Mmp-7 expression sig-
nificantly increased at 14 days after RRV injection (P < 0.0001; Fig. 6B),
and in EHBD, Mmp-7 increased by 20- and 6-fold higher than age-
matched controls at 7 and 14 days, respectively, after RRV injection
(P < 0.0001; Fig. 6C). This pattern of mRNA expression differed
from Ggt1, which only increased in the liver 3 days after RRV (fig.
S3, A and B).

 To examine whether the cellular source of MMP-7 expression in
neonatal mice was similar to the pattern in humans, we immunostained
livers and EHBD at 3, 7, and 14 days of life of saline-injected mice
(servingascontrols) andafterRRVinjection. Incontrolmice,thehepatic
expression of MMP-7 was detected in extramedullary hematopoietic
cells and restricted to the first 3 days of life, whereas the pattern in
EHBDs was predominantly localized to cholangiocytes lining the en-
tire length of the duct epithelium, cholangiocytes of neighboring
peribiliary glands, and in few subepithelial cells at all time points
(Fig. 6, D and E). After RRV infection, MMP-7 was detected in
inflammatory cells infiltrating the periductal space of portal tracts at
7 and 14 days (Fig. 6D), with a broader staining pattern in epithelial cells

 and subepithelial compartment of EHBD (Fig. 6E). Together, the im-
munostaining pattern revealed a striking similarity with the findings in
human tissues, in which MMP-7 is expressed predominantly by cholan-
giocytes of EHBDs, witha release to the serum triggered by the epithelial
injury. These findings raised the possibility that MMP-7 may be
involved in the regulation of the phenotype of experimental BA.
Suppression of experimental BA by batimastat and
MMP-7 antibody
To directly test whether MMP-7 plays a mechanistic role in patho-
genesis of biliary injury, we injected the MMP inhibitors batimastat
(with activity against MMP-7) or GM6001 (without activity against
MMP-7) intraperitoneally on days 1, 3, 5, and 7 after RRV injection;
the vehicle [5% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), 28.5% propylene glycol,
5% Tween 80, and 62% of 0.9% NaCl] was injected into a separate
group of RRV-infected mice serving as controls. First, we evaluated
whether other MMPs were up-regulated in the experimental model
at the time of bile duct obstruction and onset of symptoms (7 days
after RRV challenge). We found minimal or no change in the mRNA
expression of Mmp-2, Mmp-3, Mmp-8, Mmp-9, Mmp-10, Mmp-12,
Mmp-13, and Mmp-14 in the liver and EHBD, with only Mmp-7
increasing in the liver by 2-fold and in EHBD by 89-fold above
controls (Fig. 7A). The RRV-infected experimental and control mice
injected with batimastat, GM6001, or vehicle were sacrificed
at 12 to 14 days after RRV injection for tissue analyses. In the
liver, the histological features of portal inflammation and
hepatocellular necrosis were mild in batimastat-treated mice
and moderate or severe in mice treated with vehicle or
GM6001 (Fig. 7B). The beneficial effects of batimastat were
even more pronounced in EHBDs, where it prevented epi-
thelial injury and duct obstruction in 86% of neonatal mice,
whereas all EHBDs were obstructed in mice injected with
GM6001 or vehicle (Fig. 7, C and D). Livers of mice treated
with batimastat had suppressed mRNA expression for Tnfa,
Cxcl1, Cxcl2, Cxcl5, and Cxcl9 14 days after RRV infection,
without changes in Cxcl10, Cxcl11, Ifng, or IL12p40 (Fig. 7E).
These findings suggested that the potential mechanisms of
tissue injury used by MMP-7 are directly or indirectly linked
to TNF-a and IL-8 circuits (29).
To more rigorously examine the impact of inhibition of
MMP-7 on the development of the obstructive phenotype in
experimental BA, we injected neutralizing anti–MMP-7
antibodies (AF-907, Bio-Techne) intraperitoneally daily to
12 newborn mice at days 1 to 5 after RRV inoculation; control
mice received goat serum. All mice were sacrificed 12 days
later. Histologically, the liver injury varied from mild to
moderate, with a notable prevention of the duct obstruction,
as shown by patency of EHBDs in 82% of the mice similarly
to the phenotype observed after administration of batimastat
(Fig. 7, B to D), whereas all control mice receiving goat serum
had full obstruction of EHBDs.
DISCUSSION
By applying large-scale quantitative proteomics to sera of in-
fants with BA, we found high circulating concentrations of
soluble proteins at the time of diagnosis of BA. Chief among
them was MMP-7, whose expression distinguished the dis-
ease from other causes of IHC. The prospective validation of
these findings in two independent cohorts pointed to the value of
MMP-7 as a biomarker of BA, with an even greater discriminatory
value when linked to the serum concentrations of GGT. Searching
for the biological basis of high circulating MMP-7, in situ immuno-
staining localized MMP-7 expression in cholangiocytes along the epi-
thelium of EHBDs and gallbladder of normal subjects, and to a lower
extent, in intrahepatic cholangiocytes of diseased livers. A similar ex-
pression pattern was present in neonatal mice, in which modeling of
the disease demonstrated a release of MMP-7 into the circulation
upon epithelial injury. Notably, pharmacologic inhibition by batima-
stat and antibody neutralization of MMP-7 suppressed the experi-
mental BA phenotype, with lower expression of Tnfa, Cxcl9, and the
three murine orthologs of IL8 and decreased tissue injury. Together,
these findings support a role for serum MMP-7 as a biomarker of BA
and a distinct cellular expression in the extrahepatic epithelium that
suggested a direct implication in pathogenesis of disease.
The discovery of minimally invasive biomarkers highly predictive of
BA is crucial for the timely diagnosis and stratification of care. Despite
the well-recognized value of young age as a key factor associated with
the best surgical outcome, the overlapping clinical and biochemical
features shared between BA and other causes of neonatal cholestasis
create a formidable diagnostic challenge that leads to a delay in surgery.
Here, the finding that the quantification of a single protein biomarker

 has an accuracy of 94.3% for BA has the potential to greatly simplify
diagnostic approaches, especially when the findings are validated in
two separate cohorts and by a different assay/technology.
Among the published biomarkers of BA, serum GGT concentra-
tions have the highest sensitivity and specificity of 40 and 98%, respec-
tively (19), which may reach up to 83 and 82% in infants aged 61 to
90 days (20). The analysis of the behavior of GGT in our cohorts
showed higher concentrations in BA, with 83% sensitivity and 81%
specificity to predict the disease. When we coupled serum
MMP-7 with GGT in a composite model, we obtained higher
sensitivity and specificity of 97 and 94%, respectively, at op-
timal cutoff, which provided positive and negative predictive
values of 85 and 99%, respectively, if one considers the prev-
alence of BA of 25.9% among infants with conjugated hyper-
bilirubinemia (30). Other candidate biomarkers previously
reported include miR-140-3p (31), miR-200b/429 (14),
miR-4429, and miR-4689 (32) but with lower sensitivity
(66 to 83%) and specificity (79 to 83%) and no prospective
validation. In a separate study, the use of two-dimensional
gel electrophoresis with tandem mass spectrometry found
a combination of 11 proteins as biomarkers; the small cohort
size and relatively large number of protein analytes selected
in this study limit the interpretation of the results and their
potential use in clinical practice (33). Together, these data
suggest a superior value for MMP-7 + GGT among circulat-
ing biomarkers of BA. Their predictive features may extend
beyond the published predictive value of liver histology in
BA (25, 34). In fact, assuming the existence of some degree
of variability among pathologists in interpreting histological
features of biliary obstruction (25), the noninvasive, non–
operator-dependent features suggest that the measurement
of serum MMP-7 + GGT early in diagnostic algorithms
may substantially facilitate the evaluation of cholestatic in-
fants and establish the diagnosis of BA.
The singular emergence of MMP-7 from a comprehensive
proteomic analysis points to a potential link to pathogenic
mechanism(s) of disease. Previous studies have reported
MMP-7 as a diagnostic or prognostic marker for various
malignancies, including cholangiocarcinoma, pancreatic
carcinoma, and gastric cancer, as well as fibrosis of lung
and liver (35–39). Specifically relevant to our findings,
MMP-7 was previously reported as increased in serum and
liver samples from subjects with BA after surgical treatment
(40, 41), correlating with the severity of fibrosis regardless of
the degree of jaundice clearance (41). However, testing this
possibility, we found no or weak correlation between the ex-
pression of MMP-7 in the serum or in the liver and the degree
of hepatic fibrosis at the time of diagnosis. It remains possible
that the concentrations of serum MMP-7 may change after
surgical treatment and be a useful marker of progression of
tissue fibrosis.
The close relationship between MMP-7 and BA suggests
a potential role for MMP-7 inpathogenesisofdisease. Its pre-
dominant expression in normal extrahepatic cholangiocytes
and the variable detection in intrahepatic ducts of diseased
livers (from patients with BA and IHC) link its increase in
the serum to a response to tissue injury. Making use of the
mouse model of experimental BA, we directly demonstrated
this possibility by the timely rise of serum MMP-7 after rota-
virus injury of EHBDs. In published reports by other investigators, the
release of MMP-7 after injury of the lung epithelium was shown to pro-
mote shedding of syndecan-1 and CXCL-8 and create a pericellular che-
mokine gradient that controls the influx and activation of neutrophils
at the injury site (26). Furthermore, MMP-7 may modulate tissue re-
pair by cleaving E-cadherin and disrupting adherens junctions to fa-
cilitate cell migration and inflammation by activation of FAS ligand
and latent TNF-a (26, 42). Therefore, we performed proof-of-principle

 studies for investigating the role of MMP-7 in pathogenesis of biliary
injury by using antibody neutralization or inhibition by batimastat.
Both agents prevented the obstruction of EHBDs in >80% of neonatal
mice infected with RRV and decreased the expression of IL-8 orthologs
and TNF-a in mice treated with batimastat.
We recognize that acquisition and analysis of samples and data in a
prospective fashion are important to determine the diagnostic utility
of MMP-7. To overcome the intrinsic challenge of designing such a
study in a disease of very low incidence, such as BA, we used blood
samples and clinical data collected prospectively from subjects over
several years and then simulated a prospective study design by randomly
assigning the samples into the discovery and validation cohorts before
any assay or analysis. Next, we performed the SOMAscan and analyzed
the data in the discovery cohort. Only then, we sequentially validated
the findings in the two test cohorts, thus strengthening the evidence for
MMP-7 as a biomarker of disease. Another limitation is that our study
design did not include multiple subcohorts of infants with specific
syndromes of neonatal cholestasis. This limitation was largely due to
the rare nature of these diseases and to our objective of building a dis-
ease cohort that will more closely replicate the most common clinical
scenario, which includes idiopathic neonatal cholestasis (most of which
has spontaneous recovery) and a few patients with specific syndromes,
such as Alagille syndrome and deficiencies of canalicular transporters,
that are not readily distinguishable clinically. With these limitations
notwithstanding, we report a distinct increase in serum MMP-7 at
the time of diagnosis of BA, with concentrations above those in age-
matched diseased and normal controlsand high predictive features as a
biomarker of disease. Combining these findings with the rise of serum
MMP-7 after experimental biliary injury and the preliminary evidence
that it modulates tissue injury and inflammation, we propose that
MMP-7 has a role in pathogenesis of disease. Clinically, the implica-
tions of our findings relate to the potential incorporation of serum
MMP-7 alone or in combination with GGT in diagnostic algorithms
in the clinical setting. It remains to be investigated whether the longi-
tudinal measurement of serum MMP-7 may also be used to monitor
progression of liver injury and fibrosis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
Human subjects were infants with cholestasis enrolled into the Prospec-
tive Database of Infants with Cholestasis (PROBE study; ClinicalTrials.
gov identifier: NCT00061828) of the NIDDK-funded ChiLDReN
(www.childrennetwork.org). PROBE was designed to acquire longitu-
dinal, prospective clinical, and laboratory data in a standardized fash-
ion at defined time points. Serum samples from BA or IHC subjects
were randomly assigned into the discovery or validation cohort #1
(with similar numbers of subjects) before any assay or analysis. A
second validation cohort consisted of 105 samples from BA subjects.
SOMAscan proteomics was performed in individual cohorts sequen-
tially to enable the discovery of candidate protein biomarkers,
followed by validation in the two cohorts (Fig. 1).
For mouse studies, newborn mice were randomly assigned into an
“infection group,” injected with 1.5 × 106 fluorescent-forming units of
RRV or into a “control group,” injected with an equal volume as 0.9%
NaCl (saline) within 24 hours after birth to induce experimental bil-
iary injury and obstruction according to protocols published previous-
ly (29). Mice were monitored daily, and subgroups of mice were
randomly selected (independently of the presence or absence of jaun-
dice or other phenotypic feature) and sacrificed at days 3, 7, and 14 for
serum and tissue examination. Additional groups of mice were injected
intraperitoneally with 30 mg/day of batimastat (BB-94, ApexBio) or
3 mg/day of GM6001 (ApexBio) daily at 1, 3, 5, and 7 days after RRV
injection; the vehicle (5% DMSO, 28.5% propylene glycol, 5% Tween
80, and 62% of 0.9% NaCl) was used in the control group. A separate
group of neonatal mice received 10 mg of goat-derived, anti-human
MMP-7 antibody (AF-907, Bio-Techne) intraperitoneally at days 1 to 5
after RRV infection; controls included a similar volume of goat serum.
Human samples
Sera were collected at the time of diagnosis (initial evaluation before or
at the time of Kasai portoenterostomy) from 175 BA subjects; 70 other
subjects with IHC served as disease controls. The diagnosis of BA was
confirmed by the finding of luminal obstruction of EHBD by histo-
pathological examination. The diagnoses of IHC included idiopathic
neonatal hepatitis (n = 1), Alagille syndrome (n = 2), progressive famil-
ial IHC (n = 1), cytomegalovirus hepatitis (n = 1), neonatal sclerosing
cholangitis (n = 1), mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome (n = 1),
endocrinopathy (n = 1), and cholestasis of unknown etiology (n =
62). Serum samples were also obtained from nine age-matched subjects
(without history of previous liver disease) to serve as normal controls.
Tissue sections for immunostaining were obtained from deidentified
paraffin-embedded liver tissues archived in the biobank repository of
Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC); the diagnosis
followed the same criteria used for subjects enrolled in ChiLDReN. All
samples were obtained after informed consent from patients’ parents/
legal guardians. The study protocols were approved by the human re-
search review boards of all participating institutions.
Mice and histological analyses
NewbornmicewereoftheBALB/cstrainandwerehousedinatemperature-
controlled, 12-hour light cycle, and specific pathogen-free environment.
Histological analyses of tissues stained with hematoxylin and eosin
were performed by an investigator unaware of the experimental or con-
trol origin of samples. EHBDs were classified as obstructed or patent,
and liver histology was scored according to portal inflammation and
area of lobular necrosis as follows: 1 - mild portal inflammation with-
out area of necrosis (mild), 2 - mild to moderate portal inflammation
with patchy necrosis (moderate), and 3 - moderate to severe portal
inflammation with large area of necrosis (severe). The Animal Care
and Use Committee at CCHMC approved all experiments involving
laboratory animals.
Proteomic assay and MMP-7 concentration
Serum samples were subjected to the SOMAscan protein analysis plat-
form (SomaLogic Inc.). The assay measures 1129 proteins simulta-
neously using aptamer-based technology; detailed assay protocols
and specificity have been described elsewhere (18). To determine
the interassay reproducibility, we included six samples in every run
to serve as bridging samples.
MMP-7concentrationsweredeterminedbyELISAusingMILLIPLEX
Multiplex kits (Millipore) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Briefly, 25 ml of sample in duplicate was incubated with 25 ml of
antibody-coated beads in a 96-well multiscreen filter plate overnight
at 4°C on a plate shaker. Plates were then washed twice on a vacuum
apparatus, followed by the addition of 25 ml of secondary antibody,
and incubation at room temperature for 1 hour with gentle shaking.
To the plate, 25 ml of streptavidin–R-phycoerythrin were added and

 incubated for 30 min and then washed and read using the Bio-Plex
(Bio-Rad). Concentrations were calculated from standard curves
using recombinant proteins and expressed in nanograms per milliliter.
Histology, immunohistochemistry, and automated
image analysis
The correlation of liver fibrosis with serum MMP-7 used histological
grade scores generated by ChiLDReN pathologists for liver biopsy
samples from the same subjects with BA whose sera were analyzed
by the SOMAscan assay. Immunohistochemistry was performed on
5-mm paraffin-embedded tissue sections from human subjects and ex-
perimental mice, as described previously (43), using 1:50 polyclonal
MMP-7 antibody (Cloud-Clone Corp.) in blocking serum overnight at
4°C. Biotinylated anti-rabbit antibody (Vector Laboratories) was used as
secondary antibody followed by avidin/biotin detection (VECTASTAIN
ABC reagent PK-4001; Vector Laboratories) and the 3,3′-diaminobenzidine
(DAB) substrate (Vector kit, SK-4100; Vector Laboratories). The same
protocol was used in human and mouse tissues. An additional liver
biopsy slide from each BA subject was subjected to Masson’s tri-
chrome staining. For image analyses, entire sections were scanned
and subdivided to depict the portal tracts using Olympus BX51 micro-
scope (Olympus America Inc.) and cellSens Dimension digital imaging
software (version 1.8.1, Olympus Corporation). Automated quantifica-
tion of MMP-7 expression was performed on scanned images with
NIS Nikon Elements software using red-green-blue (RGB) general
analysis. Positive expression was defined as DAB-positive (DAB+)
brown area. Portal tracts were selected and enumerated as regions of
interest. RGB general analysis was usedin hue, saturation,and intensity
modes to identify DAB+ areas. All subdivided regions were averaged
to report surface area of DAB+ per portal tract in each sample. For
Masson’s trichrome staining, positive collagen was defined by blue
areas with use of hue, saturation, and intensity modes. The quantifica-
tion was reported as surface area of collagen (blue-stained)/portal tract.
Microarray analysis
We obtained data on MMP-7 expression from the genome-wide ex-
pression data sets of human liver samples of BA, IHC, and healthy
controls (as above) reportedby us previously andsubmitted to the Gene
Expression Omnibus (data accessible at NCBI GEO database, accession
GSE46995) (17). The data sets were extracted as Affymetrix CEL files
and analyzed with GeneSpring software (Agilent Technologies).
Quantitative PCR
Total RNA was isolated from the livers and EHBDs of RRV- or saline-
injected BALB/c mice with or without batimastat or vehicle injection
using the RNeasy Mini Kit, according to the manufacturer’s protocol
(Qiagen Inc.); RNA integritywas verified by agarose gel electrophoresis
as described previously (29). All samples were then reverse-transcribed
to cDNA using the High-Capacity RNA-to-cDNA kit (Applied Biosys-
tems) and used for RT-PCR on a Stratagene Mx3000P thermocycler
(Agilent Technologies Inc.) to detect relative concentrations of individ-
ual mRNAs. PCR amplifications were performed with specific primers
of Mmp-7, Ggt1, Cxcl1, Cxcl2, Cxcl5, Cxcl9, Cxcl10, Cxcl11, Tnfa, Ifng,
and IL12p40 (table S4). mRNA expression of target genes was normal-
ized to the endogenous reference Gapdh gene.
Statistical analysis
Without a priori data on the serum concentration of 1129 proteins in
the first year of life, we did not estimate a sample size, and instead,
built a discovery cohort with a convenience size of n = 35 each for
BA and for IHC. Then, we developed a validation cohort #1 that
matched the numbers for BA and IHC (n = 35 for each) and additional
samples of BA only as a validation cohort #2 (n = 105), without inclu-
sion of IHC, due to the lack of available samples. All protein results
were log-transformed to accommodate the wide range of assayed pro-
teins and skewness of their measurement values. Statistical analyses
and graphic presentation were performed using SAS software, version
9.3. First, we chose the candidate proteins using Student’s t test with
FDR correction (Benjamini-Hochberg procedure) in the discovery
cohort; significance criteria were adjusted P (Q value) < 0.05 for BA
versus IHC. Then, we applied multivariable stepwise logistic regres-
sion analysis to the list of candidate proteins to identify proteins that
best discriminate BA from IHC. The diagnostic performance of the
biomarkers was assessed by analyzing ROC curves and by calculating
the AUC of each model. The sensitivity (true positive) and the spec-
ificity (true negative) were determined at optimal cutoff probability.
Positive and negative predictive values were calculated using preva-
lence of BA among infants with cholestasis reported in the literature
(30). Likewise, the ROC analyses were used to validate the diagnostic
performance of each model in the validation cohort #1. In the second
validation, because the cohort consisted of BA subjects only, we used
the cutoff probability from the discovery cohort to assess the probability
of true positive and false negative, followed by calculation of sensitivity.
Other statistical analyses included ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis test, and
Spearman and Pearson correlations. Differences were considered sta-
tistically significant at P < 0.05. The NNM was calculated as described
previously (21).
