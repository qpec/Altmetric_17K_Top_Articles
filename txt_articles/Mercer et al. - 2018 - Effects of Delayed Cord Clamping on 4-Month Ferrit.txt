Objective To evaluate whether placental transfusion influences brain myelination at 4 months of age.
Study design A partially blinded, randomized controlled trial was conducted at a level III maternity hospital in
the US. Seventy-three healthy term pregnant women and their singleton fetuses were randomized to either delayed
umbilical cord clamping (DCC, >5 minutes) or immediate clamping (ICC, <20 seconds). At 4 months of age, blood
was drawn for ferritin levels. Neurodevelopmental testing (Mullen Scales of Early Learning) was administered, and
brain myelin content was measured with magnetic resonance imaging. Correlations between myelin content and
ferritin levels and group-wise DCC vs ICC brain myelin content were completed.
Results In the DCC and ICC groups, clamping time was 172 ± 188 seconds vs 28 ± 76 seconds (P < .002), re-
spectively; the 48-hour hematocrit was 57.6% vs 53.1% (P < .01). At 4 months, infants with DCC had significantly
greater ferritin levels (96.4 vs 65.3 ng/dL, P = .03). There was a positive relationship between ferritin and myelin
content. Infants randomized to the DCC group had greater myelin content in the internal capsule and other early
maturing brain regions associated with motor, visual, and sensory processing/function. No differences were seen
between groups in the Mullen testing.
Conclusion At 4 months, infants born at term receiving DCC had greater ferritin levels and increased brain myelin
in areas important for early life functional development. Endowment of iron-rich red blood cells obtained through
DCC may offer a longitudinal advantage for early white matter development. (J Pediatr 2018;203:266-72).

elayed cord clamping (DCC) at birth supports a transfer of blood from the placenta to the newborn infant, resulting
in a 30% increase in blood volume and a 50% increase in iron-rich red cell volume.1,2 Ferritin, the major iron
storage protein in the body, is increased after DCC through 6 months of age,3 whereas immediate cord clamping
(ICC) decreases early iron stores4-11 and may contribute to iron deficiency (ID) in infancy.12 Infant ID can adversely
affect cognitive, motor, social–emotional, and behavioral development.13-18 Red
blood cells from DCC may provide a critical early iron endowment for the
oligodendrocytes, the most metabolically active cells in the brain. These myelin-
producing cells are sensitive to iron deprivation, as oligodendrocytes require
iron for both maturation and function.19-24 Iron is transported readily across the
blood–brain barrier, on demand, through the process of transferrin endocytosis.20
Studies in animals clearly link hypomyelination with ID and neurodevelopmental
impairment,15 and abnormal myelination is associated with a variety of
childhood developmental disorders, including dyslexia and autism spectrum
disorders.25-27

 Based on the importance of iron availability for oligoden-
drocytes to form myelin, we investigated the potential effects
of timing of umbilical cord clamping (DCC vs ICC) on myelin
maturation. We employed a novel, noninvasive neuroimaging
technique termed mcDESPOT (multicomponent-Driven Equi-
librium Single-Pulse Observation of T1 and T2) to quantify
myelin water volume fraction (VFm), a surrogate measure for
myelin content28-30 that has been used previously to charac-
terize normative patterns of myelination in healthy infants,31,32
and to investigate relationships between myelin content and
evolving brain function and cognitive skills.33,34
We hypothesized that infants born at term exposed to pla-
cental transfusion via DCC (or cord milking) would have
greater iron stores and enhanced myelin formation showing
increased myelin content at 4 months of age compared with
infants who were exposed to ICC.
Methods
Enrollment for this randomized controlled trial (RCT) was con-
ducted from July 2012 to November 2015 (ClinicalTrials.gov:
NCT01620008), and corresponding follow-up at 4 months of
age occurred from November 2012 to March 2016. The study
was conducted at Women and Infants Hospital of Rhode Island
and Brown University (Providence, Rhode Island) after ap-
proval by the institutional review boards from Women and
Infants Hospital, the University of Rhode Island, and Brown
University. Results of the birth and 2-day data have been pub-
lished previously.35 Assessments at 12 months of age were com-
pleted in November 2016 and 24-month assessments in
December 2017.
Intervention, Randomization, and Blinding
Methods for enrollment and randomization for this study
have been described previously.35 We obtained informed
consent from healthy, term pregnant women and enrolled
them prenatally. Just before birth, blocked stratified random-
ization was used (in sequenced and sealed envelopes) to
assign women to either DCC (>5 minutes) or ICC (<20
seconds). Milking of the cord (5 times) was the proxy for
DCC at cesarean delivery or if the provider could not delay.
Residual placental blood volume (RPBV), the remaining
blood in the placenta after birth, was obtained via drainage.35
Blinding of the research assistants at the infant’s birth was
not possible due to the nature of the intervention. However,
group assignment was not revealed to the pediatric or labo-
ratory staff or the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
developmental testing personnel. All study staff except the
birth research assistants were unaware of the randomization
assignment.
Participant Follow-Up
There were 4 separate data collection points for the subjects
at 4 months of age: well-baby visit, blood draw for iron
indices (including ferritin), MRI, and neurodevelopmental
testing. To support retention, contact with participants was
maintained by the research assistants and the lead research
nurse. Research assistants attended the infants’ 4-month
well-baby pediatric visits and collected growth and health
data. Within 1 week of the blood draw, MRI scans were
completed (limited to 140 days of life for the 4-month
analyses). Neurodevelopmental testing was completed within
1 week of a successful MRI.
At 4 months, a heel capillary blood sample was collected for
a complete blood count and iron indices including ferritin,
transferrin, soluble transferrin receptor, and C-reactive protein.
The samples were collected by a pediatric nurse at the child’s
home or by a laboratory technician at the hospital labora-
tory. Discussion of the blood sample methods is found in the
Appendix (available at www.jpeds.com).
Infants underwent MRI during natural, nonsedated sleep
at either nap or bedtime on a Siemens Tim Trio 3 Tesla scanner
(Siemens Healthineers Headquarters, Erlangen, Germany). Mea-
sures of brain myelin content, as measured by VFm, were ac-
quired from 4-month-old participants using the mcDESPOT
MRI technique and following previously described guide-
lines for infant neuroimaging.36 Further details about the MRI
technique can be found in the Appendix. Notably, this tech-
nique has been used extensively to study myelination pat-
terns in infancy and early childhood.31-33,37,38
Within 7 days of a successful MRI, each child was assessed
with the Mullen Scales of Early Learning, a standardized and
population-normed tool for assessing fine and gross motor
control, visual reception, and expressive and receptive lan-
guage for children up to 5 years, 9 months of age.39 In addi-
tion to individual age-normalized domain scores, there are 3
composite Mullen scores that reflect overall cognitive ability
(Early Learning Composite) as well as verbal and nonverbal
development quotients. Each of these composite scores is ex-
pressed as a standard score with a mean of 100 and an SD of
15. In addition, mothers were asked to complete the Edin-
burgh Postnatal Depression Scale at the enrollment visit and
at 4 months after birth as well as the Parental Stress Index at
4 months of age.
Sample Size
Effect sizes based on data from previous studies of ferritin levels
after DCC suggest that without adjustment sample sizes of 30
per group would have more than 80% power at an alpha of
0.05 to detect differences in ferritin levels between the 2
groups.3,5,6 Substantial variance reduction (at least 50%) can
be achieved by controlling for baseline covariates, such as age,
gestational age, and birth weight, as planned. No previous data
exist for the effects of umbilical cord clamping time on VFm.
Deoni et al reported that the SD of VFm estimates in white
matter is 5% in healthy children.40 To reliably measure a 5%
VFm difference between the control and experimental groups,
using a 2-sample t test (alpha = 0.05, power = 0.80), 16 ob-
servations per group were required.
Statistical Analyses
Data analyses included 2-sided Pearson c2 tests, 2-sample t tests,
and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests for non-normally distributed

 variables. Primary analyses were conducted using intention-
to-treat, and sensitivity analyses were conducted using actual
treatment to assess the robustness of the findings and to
examine results of the biological variables. Log transforma-
tion was used for the analysis of the ferritin levels due to non-
normal distribution of the ferritin data. The level of significance
was .05 (2-tailed) for main effects. Data were analyzed with
SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, North Carolina) and SPSS
Version 23 (IBM Corp, Armonk, New York).
Image Analysis and Statistical Testing
Associations between VFm and 4-month blood ferritin levels
were evaluated at each image voxel using a general linear model
(GLM) that included age, gestational age, and birth weight as
additional variables of noninterest. Voxel-wise VFm differ-
ences between the DCC and ICC groups additionally were in-
vestigated by performing an unpaired t test. The FMRIB
Software Library package (FMRIB Analysis Group, Oxford,
United Kingdom) was used to construct the GLM, and both
the GLM and group differences were tested nonparametrically
using permutation testing (randomize) and 5000 permuta-
tions. Significance was defined as P < .05, with correction for
the multiple comparisons in MRI data using a cluster-based
technique.41,42
Results
Seventy-three healthy term pregnant women were random-
ized to DCC or ICC. At 4 months, 64 (88%) infants were active
participants. Of those, 59 (92%) had blood draws and 58 (91%)
underwent MRI scanning. Fifty-six (88%) infants completed
the developmental testing. Of the 58 MRIs completed, 48 MRIs
were completed before 140 days (83%) and 44 (92%) were
usable (Figure 1; available at www.jpeds.com). Only data from
these 44 infants are reported here and are referred to as the
MRI cohort.
Participant demographics and clinical variables for infants
with an MRI within 140 days are shown in Tables I and II.
There were no significant group differences with respect to ma-
ternal age, education, type of insurance, mode of delivery, ges-
tational age, birth weight, or sex. Consistent with the previous
report,35 infants in the MRI cohort with DCC had longer cord-
clamping time (per protocol) (P = .002), less RPBV at birth
(P = .05), and greater hematocrit levels at 2 days of age (P = .01).
There was no difference in cord ferritin levels between the
groups.
Table II shows no differences in hemoglobin, hematocrit,
or other blood values at 4 months of age with analysis by in-
tention to treat. However, infants who received DCC exhib-
ited greater ferritin and log ferritin levels, and the absolute
(relative) effect size was 31.1 (48%), 95% CI –59.7, –2.5. All
ferritin levels were within normal range.43 Ferritin levels <40
occurred in 22% of the in the ICC group compared with 9%
of the DCC group (P = .23). The mode of feeding was not dif-
ferent between groups and was not a significant predictor for
ferritin. Thus, it was not included in a model for ferritin and
VFm. None of the infants in either group received iron
supplementation.
There were no significant differences between groups on any
of the other blood values examined (Table II). We found no
significant differences in neurodevelopmental testing in the
Mullen verbal and nonverbal developmental quotient com-
posite scores or overall cognitive ability between the DCC and
ICC groups (Table II). The values highlight that both groups
fall within the normal range of Mullen scores and are within
1 SD of the standardized mean.
There were significant positive associations between VFm
and 4-month blood ferritin levels (Figure 2). In particular, these
associations were localized in regions of early developing white
matter, including the right hemisphere cerebellar white matter,
brain stem, parietal and occipital lobes, as well as the left and
right anterior and posterior internal capsules. In all cases, greater
levels of ferritin were associated with increased VFm. Con-
trolling for sex did not affect the findings.
Dichotomous comparisons between infants in the DCC and
ICC groups revealed infants exposed to DCC had signifi-
cantly more myelin content in early myelinating areas than
infants exposed to ICC. Analysis was completed using both in-
tention to treat and actual treatment. Both analyses demon-
strated significant differences, but actual treatment showed more
robust differences in the various brain regions (Figure 3).
Regions with increased myelin included the brain stem and
cerebellum, left and right posterior arms of the internal capsule,

Discussion
Infants who received a placental transfusion had greater fer-
ritin levels at 4 months of age compared with those with ICC,
as previously reported.3 In addition, these greater ferritin levels
were associated with increased brain myelination at 4 months
of age. Using mcDESPOT-derived VFm, a novel quantitative
MRI measure of brain myelin content, we found that infants
who received DCC had increased myelination at 4 months of
age compared with those who received ICC. We observed sig-
nificant VFm differences between infants receiving DCC and
ICC, with infants receiving DCC having increased VFm in
similar brain regions associated with the blood ferritin levels.
Collectively, these results suggest a direct neurophysiological
link between DCC and early myelin development, reinforc-
ing and strengthening the literature that draws attention to the
benefits of DCC in the newborn and supporting the previ-
ous finding that an endowment of iron-rich blood cells fa-
cilitated by placental transfusion is associated with increased
iron storage and blood ferritin levels.3 This study extends the
available evidence to show that increased ferritin levels are as-
sociated with greater brain myelin content at 4 months of
age.
Beginning in the late second trimester and early third tri-
mester, oligodendrocytes lay the groundwork for the lipid
myelin bilayers that sheathe neuronal axons in a carefully or-
chestrated pattern that extends center-out and from poste-
rior to anterior brain regions.44,45 This process initiates within
the brain stem and cerebellum, progresses to the cerebellum
and internal capsules by the first postnatal month, and extends
to parietal and occipital white matter between 4 and 6 months
of age, before continuing its protracted developmental trajec-
tory across the cortex.31,36,46 Over the first 2 postnatal years, my-
elination advances rapidly, with myelin present in nearly all
brain areas by 9 months of age, and approximately 80% of adult
levels reached by the end of year 2. An activity-driven process,47
the establishment and maintenance of the myelin sheath re-
quires timed delivery of essential lipids and micronutrients,
including iron.23,30,48 Significant associations between blood fer-
ritin levels and VFm as well as VFm differences between infants
with DCC and ICC were localized to these early developing
brain regions, including the brain stem, cerebellar, parietal and
occipital white matter, and the internal capsules. Our find-
ings suggest that placental transfusion at birth may result in
increased iron stores, represented by ferritin, and may help
promote myelination in the first few months of life. This is par-
ticularly important, as myelinated axons facilitate rapid and
efficient brain communication and messaging.49,50 Future

Effects of Delayed Cord Clamping on 4-Month Ferritin Levels, Brain Myelin Content, and
Neurodevelopment: A Randomized Controlled Trial
 research examining whether these myelination differences
between infants with DCC and ICC persist, become more ex-
tensive, or normalize over time will be important. Evaluation
of the long-term consequences of DCC on infant brain de-
velopment and other neurodevelopmental outcomes is planned.
In this RCT, infants will return for MRI scans and
neurodevelopmental testing at 12 and 24 months of age, pro-
viding the opportunity to continue to study such outcomes.
The early developing brain regions, ie, the internal cap-
sules, differed between infants with DCC and ICC. These areas
of the brain are essential to a wide variety of cognitive func-
tions, including motor and sensory processing.46 Previous
studies investigating neurobehavioral outcomes following DCC
using neurodevelopmental testing only demonstrated im-
proved scores in fine motor and the social domains in infants
with DCC at 4 years of age, especially in boys,51 although no
differences were seen at 4 and 12 months of age.3,52 Our find-
ings suggest that differences in myelin content may underlie
neurodevelopmental differences between infants with DCC and
ICC that appear later in childhood. The present study exam-
ined neurodevelopmental outcomes in infants at 4 months of
age as this stage of infancy marks the onset of the most rapid
period
of
myelin
development.46
We
observed
no
neurodevelopmental differences between the DCC and ICC
groups at this early time. VFm differences between children
with above-average and below-average cognitive ability do not
present until early toddlerhood (1-2 years).53 Thus,
neurodevelopmental gains resulting from DCC may not be ob-
servable until later in development. Assessment of the infants
enrolled in our current RCT at 12 and 24 months of age will
allow us to examine whether these differences manifest over
time.
One potential mechanism underlying our findings of early
myelination in infants with DCC and ICC may be related to
iron. Iron is involved in myelinogenesis and is a necessary
component for the maturation and function of the
oligodendrocytes.21 Studies in animals have demonstrated that
ID can lead to altered myelin lipid synthesis,15,54 changes in
myelin basic protein transcripts,55 and fundamental changes
to the myelin-producing oligodendrocyte populations.21 ID can
disrupt the trajectory of myelination growth and subse-
quently result in long-lasting myelin alterations.13 Our find-
ings associating VFm and blood ferritin levels have not been
reported previously. The increased iron stores afforded by in-
creased red cell volume at birth facilitated by DCC appear to
lead to increased infant myelination at 4 months of age. Myelin-
producing oligodendrocytes, the predominant cell type con-
taining iron, are composed of a mixture of ferritin subunits,
which allows these cells to both store and use iron in the bio-
synthesis of cholesterol and lipids for myelin production.21 Thus,
increased iron endowed through placental transfusion as mea-
sured by ferritin may enable oligodendrocytes to more rapidly
accumulate iron and initiate and sustain myelination more
quickly. However, this theory should be more specifically in-
vestigated with additional research in humans and animals.
Nonetheless, our findings provide further evidence of an as-
sociation between iron or ferritin and early brain myelina-
tion and may have important implications for clinical practice
based on these underlying mechanisms.
This study used a 5-minute delay for DCC. When the study
began in 2010, skin-to-skin care was adopted by the hospital
as the standard of care for healthy infants born at term. We
chose the 5-minute delay based on our pilot study,56 which
showed that RPBV was significantly greater in infants placed
skin-to-skin with ICC or a 2-minute delay compared with
infants with a 5-minute delay or cord milking (×5). We wanted
to obtain the maximum difference in placental transfusion
between groups to optimize variances in the MRI results. One
concern was that a delay of 5 minutes in this RCT resulted in
a RPBV of 20 mL/kg, which was more residual blood than ex-
pected. It is also more than we found in our earlier pilot study,
which yielded 11 mL/kg for infants born at term after 5 minutes.
In addition,Yao reported 13.8 mL/kg of RPBV after a 3-minute
delay with infants held below the level of the perineum, sug-
gesting that placing the infant on the maternal abdomen slows
the placental transfusion.2
Although we demonstrated greater ferritin levels at 4 months
with DCC, the levels were lower than those in a study by
Andersson et al, who reported a 3-minute delay but did not
discuss placement of the infant.3 In a personal conversation,

 the lead author reported that the midwives held the infants
below the level of the placenta for about 30 seconds as cord
blood gases were obtained. Infants were then placed skin-to-
skin. It is possible that the infants obtained more placental trans-
fusion during those first 30 seconds.
Despite the findings of greater ferritin levels in the DCC
group at 4 months, we found no differences in the hemoglo-
bin and hematocrit levels. This finding is consistent with other
studies in infants born at term,3,57 suggesting that hemoglo-
bin and hematocrit levels do not adequately represent the in-
fant’s body iron stores. Yet, ferritin levels are not assessed
routinely at 4 months. Thus, most pediatric providers rely on
the hemoglobin and hematocrit to reflect iron status.58
Although the current study suggests DCC results in better
VFm outcomes in infants at 4 months of age, and mcDESPOT
has shown qualitative agreement with myelin histology,59,60
future studies are needed to quantitatively validate mcDESPOT
measures.
Nonetheless,
the
extant
literature
using
mcDESPOT31-33,37,38 provides confidence that mcDESPOT-
derived VFm measurements are sensitive to myelin content.
Placental transfusion via DCC facilitates a transfer of re-
sidual iron-rich placental blood and increases iron stores
without adverse effects. Our findings show that infants who
received a placental transfusion have increased myelin content
at 4 months of age compared with infants who received ICC,
adding to a growing number of studies that describe the ben-
efits of DCC. Moreover, given that DCC is a feasible, low-
tech, no-cost approach, it has the potential to have widespread
impact on early life development. Future studies examining
the long-term effects of DCC on child development would be
important, but the ethical concerns regarding comparisons to
ICC are to be considered. ■

Methods: Blood Samples. The complete blood count samples
were collected in a 0.5-mL EDTA tube (BD Microtainer, Frank-
lin Lakes, New Jersey) and then analyzed using an automated
hematology analyzer (Sysmex XN 3000; Sysmex America Inc,
Lincolnshire, Illinois). The iron indices and C-reactive protein
were collected in a 0.5-mL serum separator tube (BD
Microtainer) and analyzed with a clinical chemistry analyzer
(Architect ci4100, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, Illi-
nois). All samples, except ferritin, were processed at Women
& Infants Hospital. Ferritin was processed at the Mayo Medical
Laboratories (Rochester, New York) using an immunoassay
system (Beckman Coulter Unicel DXL 800; Beckman Coulter
Inc, Brea, California).
MRI Data Acquisition and Processing. Parents were con-
tacted to schedule the 4-month MRI. Children were brought
to the MRI center either at nap or bedtime. Special sleep rooms
were provided for parents to get the infant to sleep.When sleep-
ing, the infant was placed securely on an MRI-compatible cart
and transported to the MRI scanner. Parents (after appropri-
ate screening) were invited to stay with the infant during the
MRI. The MRI scan lasted approximately 30-45 minutes once
the infant was asleep. If an infant was unable to fall asleep or
to return to sleep after waking, the MRI examination was re-
scheduled. Within 1 week after a successful MRI scan, chil-
dren were scheduled for developmental testing.
Measures of brain myelin content were acquired with the
mcDESPOT MRI technique. mcDESPOT is a multicompo-
nent relaxometry technique that decomposes the measured MRI
signal into contributions from myelin and nonmyelin water-
based on the unique relaxation properties of each of these water
pools.1-4 Unlike traditional multicomponent relaxometry
techniques,1,2 mcDESPOT uses rapid and time-efficient gra-
dient echo sequences, acquired over a range of flip angles, to
quantify the relaxation characteristics of multicompartment
water pools.5,6 Specifically, the mcDESPOT protocol in-
cluded 8 T1-weighted spoiled gradient-recalled echo (SPGR)
and 16 T1/T2-weighted balanced steady-state free precession
(bSSFP) images acquired over multiple flip angles.5,6 Two
inversion-prepared (IR)-SPGR images additionally were ac-
quired for correction of radio-frequency (B1) inhomogene-
ities, and bSSFP images were acquired with 2 phase cycling
patterns (4 = 180° and 0°) for correction of main magnetic field
(B0) inhomogeneities.7 Choice of scan acquisition param-
eters for the mcDESPOT protocol have been optimized ac-
cording to the relaxation characteristics at various stages of
infancy and early childhood.8 Specific acquisition param-
eters of the SPGR, bSSFP, and IR-SPGR scans used in the
current study are as follows:
SPGR: repetition time (TR) = 12 milliseconds; echo time
(TE) = 5.8 milliseconds; flip angles (a) = [2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11,
14] degrees; receiver bandwidth = 350 Hz/voxel; and 6/8 partial
k-space in the phase and slice-encode directions.
bSSFP: TR = 10 milliseconds; TE = 5 milliseconds; a = [9, 14,
20, 27, 34, 41, 56, 70]; bandwidth = 350 Hz/voxel; 6/8 partial
k-space in the phase and slice–encode directions.
IR-SPGR: TR = 12 milliseconds; TE = 5.8 milliseconds; in-
version times = [600, 950] milliseconds; a = 5 degrees; 6/8
partial k-space in the phase-encode directions. Half the reso-
lution in the slice direction.
All data were acquired from each participating 4-month-
old infant on a Siemens Tim Trio 3 Tesla scanner (Siemens)
with a 12-channel head radiofrequency array. To help the chil-
dren sleep during the scan, acoustic noise levels were mini-
mized by reducing imaging gradient slew rates and peak values.
Additional passive sound attenuation was achieved with a
sound-insulating bore liner (Ultra Barrier HD Composite;
American Micro Industries, Chambersburg, Pennsylvania) and
MiniMuff ear pads. Electrodynamic and sound-attenuating
headphones (MR Confon GmbH, Magdeburg, Germany) also
were used and provided constant white noise throughout the
duration of the scan.9
Following successful acquisition, image data were in-
spected visually for motion-related image artifacts (eg, edge
blurring and ghosting). Each participant’s SPGR, bSSFP, and
IR-SPGR images were then linearly coregistered to account for
subtle head movement10 and nonbrain (ie, skull) signal was
removed.11 SPGR and IR-SPGR images were used to estimate
the flip angle correction map.12 VFm values were calculated
at each image voxel by fitting the SPGR and bSSFP data to a
multicomponent relaxometry model of 3 microstructural water
compartments: intra/extra-axonal water, myelin-associated
water, and nonexchanging free water.6
For correlation analysis and group comparisons, indi-
vidual VFm maps were nonlinearly aligned to a common study
template8 using a fully 3-dimensional image registration
approach.13 Before statistical analyses, aligned VFm data were
smoothed with a modest 4-mm full-width-at-half-maximum
3D Gaussian kernel to account for residual registration
inaccuracies.14
