Functional brain networks demonstrate significant temporal variability and dynamic reconfiguration even in the resting state.
Currently, most studies investigate temporal variability of brain networks at the scale of single (micro) or whole-brain (macro)
connectivity. However, the mechanism underlying time-varying properties remains unclear, as the coupling between brain network
variability and neural activity is not readily apparent when analysed at either micro or macroscales. We propose an intermediate
(meso) scale analysis and characterize temporal variability of the functional architecture associated with a particular region. This
yields a topography of variability that reflects the whole-brain and, most importantly, creates an analytical framework to establish
the fundamental relationship between variability of regional functional architecture and its neural activity or structural connect-
ivity. We find that temporal variability reflects the dynamical reconfiguration of a brain region into distinct functional modules at
different times and may be indicative of brain flexibility and adaptability. Primary and unimodal sensory-motor cortices demon-
strate low temporal variability, while transmodal areas, including heteromodal association areas and limbic system, demonstrate
the high variability. In particular, regions with highest variability such as hippocampus/parahippocampus, inferior and middle
temporal gyrus, olfactory gyrus and caudate are all related to learning, suggesting that the temporal variability may indicate the
level of brain adaptability. With simultaneously recorded electroencephalography/functional magnetic resonance imaging and
functional magnetic resonance imaging/diffusion tensor imaging data, we also find that variability of regional functional architec-
ture is modulated by local blood oxygen level-dependent activity and a-band oscillation, and is governed by the ratio of intra- to
inter-community structural connectivity. Application of the mesoscale variability measure to multicentre datasets of three mental
disorders and matched controls involving 1180 subjects reveals that those regions demonstrating extreme, i.e. highest/lowest
variability in controls are most liable to change in mental disorders. Specifically, we draw attention to the identification of
diametrically opposing patterns of variability changes between schizophrenia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder/autism.
Regions of the default-mode network demonstrate lower variability in patients with schizophrenia, but high variability in patients
with autism/attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, compared with respective controls. In contrast, subcortical regions, especially
the thalamus, show higher variability in schizophrenia patients, but lower variability in patients with attention deficit hyperactivity
disorder. The changes in variability of these regions are also closely related to symptom scores. Our work provides insights into the
dynamic organization of the resting brain and how it changes in brain disorders. The nodal variability measure may also be
potentially useful as a predictor for learning and neural rehabilitation.

Introduction
The human brain demonstrates remarkable variability in its
structure and function (Rademacher et al., 2001; Sugiura
et al., 2007; Frost and Goebel, 2012), which explains inter-
subject variability in cognitive function and other behav-
iours. Intersubject variability in resting state functional
connectivity is heterogeneous across the cortex, and it is
significantly correlated with the degree of evolutionary cor-
tical expansion (Mueller et al., 2013). Individual variability
in functional connectivity is also predictive of task perform-
ance (Baldassarre et al., 2012). Recently, the temporal vari-
ability of neuronal activity and functional connectivity/
functional
networks
has
attracted
increasing
attention
(Bassett
et
al.,
2011,
2013,
2015;
Hutchison
et
al.,
2013a; Mueller et al., 2013; Calhoun et al., 2014; Kopell
et al., 2014; Kucyi and Davis, 2014; Tagliazucchi and
Laufs, 2014; Braun et al., 2015). For example, variability
of blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal, which was
previously considered to be measurement-related ‘noise’,
has been demonstrated to have significant age-predictive
power (Garrett et al., 2010) and is related to task perform-
ance (Garrett et al., 2011). Even during rest, either sliding
window or time-frequency analysis shows non-stationarity
in both spontaneous brain activity (McIntosh et al., 2008;
Lippe et al., 2009; Garrett et al., 2010, 2011; Misic et al.,
2010; Protzner et al., 2010; Samanez-Larkin et al., 2010)
and interactions among brain regions (Chang and Glover,
2010; Kang et al., 2011; Majeed et al., 2011; Hutchison
et al., 2013b; Mueller et al., 2013).
To date, most work on dynamic brain network analysis
either focuses on single functional connectivity between a
given pair of regions of interest (Chang and Glover, 2010;
Kang et al., 2011; Majeed et al., 2011; Hutchison et al.,
2013a; Kucyi and Davis, 2014; Zalesky et al., 2014), or the
connectivity of the whole brain (Allen et al., 2014).
Temporal variability of brain networks at the mesoscale,
i.e. the functional architecture of a given region (defined
as the overall functional connectivity profile associated
with the region), has never been investigated. While non-
stationarity in functional connectivity/networks has been
revealed, the underlying mechanisms and neuroanatomical
basis for temporal variability are still unknown. The advan-
tage of investigating temporal variability of functional
architecture associated with a specific brain region (i.e. a
mesoscale analysis), is 2-fold. First, it allows coupling be-
tween temporal variability of the functional architecture of
a region and its neural activity to be conveniently analysed.
This helps delineate factors contributing to temporal vari-
ability, thus shedding light on the underlying mechanisms.
Second, it facilitates the construction of a whole-brain top-
ography of variability, which allows localization of regions
showing significant variability changes in patients, thus
helping to define the dynamics of functional brain networks
for various brain disorders. In comparison, analysis at the
level of single functional connectivity would increase the
burden of correction for multiple comparisons, while ana-
lysis of the whole-brain functional connectivity simultan-
eously may be less sensitive in uncovering local (regional)
changes.

 Temporal variability of regional, or nodal functional
architecture
can
be
characterized
by
first
constructing
whole-brain functional networks from BOLD signals at suc-
cessive, non-overlapping time windows and second, by com-
paring the functional architecture of a region of interest
across different windows. Accordingly, we hypothesized
that temporal variability of regional functional architecture
is modulated by local neural activity, as manifested by the
BOLD signal and EEG, and that it has an anatomical sub-
strate. Using simultaneously recorded EEG/functional MRI
and functional MRI/diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data, we
found that the temporal variability of functional architecture
of a given region is modulated by local BOLD activity, i.e.
amplitude and frequency of BOLD oscillations during the
scan, and that it is positively associated with the EEG �
power of the region of interest. Variability is also related
to the ratio of intra- to inter-community structural connect-
ivity of a region. Application to different psychiatric dis-
orders, including schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder,
and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) with
their matched controls, revealed disease-specific variability
changes in the default mode network (DMN), as well as
visual and subcortical regions of the brain, which provides
new insights of spatiotemporal organization of the brain
networks and how it changes in patients with psychiatric
disease.
Materials and methods
Participants, image acquisition and
data preprocessing
The study included eight multicentre datasets involving 1180
subjects. Six resting state functional MRI datasets were used
for case-control studies of variability change in patients with
psychiatric disorders: schizophrenia [Dataset 1: Taiwan (Guo
et al., 2014); Dataset 2: COBRE], autism (Dataset 3: New
York

are
given
in
Table
1
and
Supplementary Table 1. An EEG/functional MRI dataset
(Dataset 7) and a functional MRI/DTI dataset (Dataset 8)
from IMAGEN consortium (Schumann et al., 2010) were
also used to investigate the electrophysiological and structural
basis of variability, respectively. Details of participants, image
acquisition and data preprocessing can be found in the
Supplementary material, which also includes a discussion of
global signal removal and details of data scrubbing.
In view of the fact that we combined multicentre data for
case-control studies, and this might possibly result in a large
variation, we set up the following exclusion criteria to help
ensure data quality: (i) subjects with poor structural scans,
or functional MRI data, making successful preprocessing
unlikely
[i.e.
normalization
to
Montreal
Neurological
Institute (MNI) space], or without complete demographic in-
formation; and (ii) head movement, including subjects with
410% displaced frames in a scrubbing procedure (Power
et al., 2014; Cheng et al., 2015b), or maximal motion between
volumes in each direction 43 mm, and rotation about each
axis 43� (Cheng et al., 2015a). In each dataset, patients and
controls were screened so that the total root mean square dis-
placements did not show significant differences. For the
ADHD dataset, we only have preprocessed data (i.e. BOLD
time series) from the public website, thus the data scrubbing
procedure cannot be performed. For the autism dataset,
subjects with an overall IQ score exceeding 2 standard devi-
ations (SD) from the overall ABIDE sample mean were not
included.
T
emporal variability of regional
functional architecture
To characterize the temporal variability of the functional archi-
tecture associated with a given region (Fig. 1A), we first seg-
mented all BOLD time series into n non-overlapping windows
each with length l. Within the ith time window, the whole-
brain functional network Fi (an m � m matrix, with m nodes)
is obtained using Pearson correlation as the measure of func-
tional connectivity. The functional architecture of a region k at
time window i is defined as the overall functional-connectivity
profile of region k, i.e. Fi (k,:) which is a m-dimensional vector
and is shortened as Fi,k. We then define the variability of a
region of interest k as:
Vk ¼ 1 � corrcoef Fi;k; Fj;k
�
�
; i; j ¼ 1; 2; 3; . . . ; n; i 6¼ j;
ð1Þ
as illustrated in Fig. 1A. The latter part of Vk compares the
functional architecture, i.e. overall functional connectivity pro-
file associated with brain region k across different time win-
dows, which is the averaged correlation coefficient among
different functional architecture of region k and thus a simi-
larity measure. Next, a deduction from 1 indicates temporal
variability of a region. In this way, it is possible to both evalu-
ate temporal variability of the functional architecture at the
network level and simultaneously localize this to a specific
brain region. In fact, this approach has been used in a different
context to measure intersubject variability of regional func-
tional architecture (Mueller et al., 2013). We have adopted
this same measure to address the temporal variability of the
functional architecture of a region in one subject.
To reduce the influence from segmentation scheme for the
BOLD signal, we perform l � 1 times segmentation for a given
window length l, and each time we start from the sth point
(s = 1,2,. . ., l) and average the variability obtained from l � 1
times segmentation. To avoid arbitrary choice of window
length in the applications, we calculate Vk at different l
(l = 10, 11, 12. . .20 volumes, equal to 20, 22, 24,. . .40 s) and
then take the average value as the final variability of the region
of interest. We chose the above window length as it was sug-
gested that window sizes around 30–60 s produce robust re-
sults in image acquisitions, cognitive states (Shirer et al., 2012)
and topological descriptions of brain networks (Jones et al.,
2012). In fact, we found that variability obtained at different
window lengths (e.g. 20 s, 30 s, 40 s) was highly correlated
(r 4 0.98, Supplementary Fig. 1), indicating that this metric

Correlation analysis between
temporal variability and local/global
measures from multimodalities
To identify the neural, electrophysiological and anatomical
basis of temporal variability, we performed extensive correl-
ation analyses using BOLD, EEG/functional MRI and func-
tional
MRI/DTI
data
collected
from
healthy
controls
(Fig. 1B). To establish the neural basis, the variability of a
region was correlated with its BOLD activity (the variance of
BOLD signal during the whole scan) and node degree across
90 brain regions for each subject in Dataset 5 (which has the
largest number of controls). To establish the electrophysiolo-
gical basis of variability, we performed correlation analyses
between the variability of a region and its � band power of
simultaneously recorded EEG during the entire scan (in
Dataset 7, across all 28 electrodes, see Supplementary mater-
ial for details of the 28 corresponding regions in the AAL
template). To establish the anatomical basis, we performed
correlation analyses between the variability of a region and
the ratio of intra- to intercommunity structural connection
(RIIC) across 90 brain regions for each subject in the
IMAGEN dataset (Dataset 8). A high RIIC implies that the
region connects more with regions belonging to the same
functional module, while a low RIIC means the region con-
nects more with nodes belonging to communities other than
its own (see DTI data preprocessing in the Supplementary
material for details).
Case-control studies: meta-analysis
integration of multicentre results
To identify regions with significant change in variability for
various mental disorders including schizophrenia, autism and
ADHD, we first performed t-test between patients and matched
healthy controls for all 90 brain regions (AAL template) for
each dataset, with age, sex and root mean square displacements
of head movement being regressed out (Fig. 1C). For disorders
with multiple datasets, we then used the Liptak-Stouffer z-score
method (Liptak, 1958) to integrate the results (e.g. MRI; Glahn
et al., 2008): the P-value of each region in the relevant dataset i
was converted to the corresponding z score: zi ¼ ��1ð1 � piÞ,
where � is the standard normal cumulative distribution func-
tion. Then a combined z-score for a functional connectivity
was obtained using the Liptak-Stouffer formula as:
Z ¼
Xk
i¼1wizi
ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi
ffi
Xk
i¼1w2
i
q
;
ð2Þ
where wi is the inverse of the variance of zi. Z follows a stand-
ard normal distribution under the null hypothesis and is trans-
formed into its corresponding P-value with both Bonferroni
(P = 0.05) and false discovery rate (FDR) (q = 0.05) correction
used to correct for multiple comparisons.
Results
Variability reflects change of
community membership, or
flexibility of a region
The temporal variability of a region defined in our paper
characterizes the collective changes of all its functional con-
nectivities over time. Low temporal variability means that
this functional architecture of a given region of interest is
highly correlated across different time windows, or alterna-
tively that the dynamical functional connectivity time series
between the region of interest and all other regions are
highly synchronized (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig. 2A).
On the contrary, high temporal variability means that the
dynamical functional connectivity series between a region
of interest and other regions remains independent (Fig. 3A
and Supplementary Fig. 2B). Due to the dynamic nature of
the functional brain network in resting state, a region of
interest may connect with different brain regions and be
involved in different functional communities/modules at dif-
ferent times. The variability herein defined is also a good
indicator for this property (Supplementary Fig. 3). Of the
62 healthy control subjects in Dataset 1, all subjects
showed significant negative correlation between the vari-
ability of a region and stability of its intra-community
members (P 5 0.05). The intra-community members of a
region of interest indicate the regions belonging to the
same functional module with the region of interest. The
above negative correlation suggests that the higher the vari-
ability of a region of interest the less stable its intra-com-
munity members, i.e. its intra-community members change
frequently with time. Since the intra-community members
of a region of interest are not stable, the region of interest
may connect with different brain regions, and functional
communities at different times. This result indicates that
the temporal variability we defined reflects the ability or
tendency of a region to reconfigure itself into different func-
tional communities, or its flexibility in terms of functional
integration/coordination with different neural systems. The
larger the temporal variability of a region of interest, the
more functional communities it will be involved with at
different times (see Supplementary Fig. 3 for details).
Stable brain-wide topography of
variability in healthy control subjects
For healthy control subjects, we found a non-uniform dis-
tribution of variability throughout the brain (Fig. 2 and
Supplementary Table 2). Various datasets consistently dem-
onstrate low variability in primary sensory cortices (e.g.
Heschl’s gyri, postcentral and calcarine gyrus), visceral sen-
sory cortex (insular), unimodal association cortex (middle/
superior occipital gyrus, cuneus, lingual gyrus, superior
temporal gyrus), and default mode systems such as the

 medial frontal gyrus and posterior cingulate/precuneus. In
comparison, the transmodal association cortices, including
the heteromodal association cortex (such as the anterior
association cortex, which includes interior and orbital fron-
tal gyrus, the posterior association cortex including inferior
parietal gyrus, inferior/middle temporal gyrus and paracen-
tral lobule) and the limbic association cortex (such as the
temporal pole, hippocampus, parahippocampus and amyg-
dala; Pearlson et al., 1996; Bullard et al., 2013) all dem-
onstrate high variability. See Supplementary Table 3 for
details of the 90 brain regions in AAL template and their
characteristics.
As shown in Supplementary Fig. 4, the temporal variability
we defined demonstrates great similarity by showing a con-
sistent pattern in healthy controls across Datasets 1–6, indi-
cating the robustness of the variability defined in our work.
T
emporal variability as an index of
regional adaptability in the brain
The human brain is perhaps the most adaptable and chan-
ging part of the body, which accounts for its incredible
learning capability. Interestingly, the transmodal cortices
of the brain, which are found to demonstrate the highest
levels
of
temporal
variability
(the
top
regions
in
Supplementary Table 2), have almost all been implicated
in key aspects of learning, suggesting that it may provide
an index of the adaptability and plasticity of these brain
regions, which support learning. For example, the hippo-
campus is extensively involved in many aspects of learning
and memory (Deng et al., 2010), the inferior temporal
cortex
in
visual
association
learning
(Kawasaki
and
Sheinberg, 2008), the olfactory cortex in olfactory learning
(Fletcher and Chen, 2010), and the caudate in reinforce-
ment-based associative learning (Williams and Eskandar,
2006) and classification learning (Seger and Cincotta,
2005). In particular, there is solid evidence that learning-
associated neurogenesis (birth of brain cells) can occur in a
number of these regions in the adult mammalian brain
(Gould et al., 1999; Rakic, 2002), including hippocampus,
olfactory bulb and inferior temporal cortex. Our proposed
link between high temporal regional variability and plasti-
city underpinning learning is further supported by our add-
itional finding that it is positively associated with various
kinds
of
IQ
score
in
two
independent
datasets
(see
Supplementary Fig. 7 for details).
Correlation between variability
and measures from multiple
neuro-modalities
Blood oxygenation level-dependent activity
Variability of a region results from the temporal changes
of its functional architecture triggered by changes in
BOLD signals. We first analysed the correlation between
variability and other measures derived from the BOLD
signal over the entire period of scan, including local meas-
ures such as the amplitude and frequency of BOLD activity,
and global measures such as the degree of the region
(defined as the number of a region’s functional connectivity

obtained from controls in six different datasets (Datasets 1–6). See Supplementary Table 2 for details.

 whose strength is larger than 0.3). We found that the tem-
poral variability of a region correlates negatively with both
the amplitude of its BOLD activity and the node degree, since
the BOLD activity of a region and its degree are positively
correlated, see (Fig. 3A, B and D). In addition, the variability
of a region is negatively associated with the energy of low
frequency components of the BOLD signal. For scatter plots
and details of correlations, (see Supplementary Fig. 5D, E
and F and Supplementary Table 4).
Electrophysiological recording
We next analysed the correlation between the variability of
a region and its � band power derived from EEG recorded
simultaneously with functional MRI data. Correlations
were performed across brain regions having both BOLD
signal and EEG recordings in each of the subjects in
Dataset 7. We found that the variability of a region was
mostly positively correlated with its � band power during
the entire period of scan, with 8 of 26 subjects (31%)
showing a significant positive correlation (Fig. 3A and C;
detailed in Supplementary Table 5).
Structural connectivity: diffusion tensor imaging
Finally, we analysed the correlation between the variability
of a region and its structural connectivity derived from
diffusion tensor imaging. We used the RIIC to determine

nodes belonging to different communities), and the lower part is for a region with a small RIIC (i.e. the region of interest connects with nodes
belonging to the same communities). All upper parts (or lower parts) in each panel are correlated such that a region with low variability will have
higher BOLD activity, a high node degree, low � band power and a high RIIC.

 the extent to which a node is structurally connected to
nodes within its own community. Of 142 healthy subjects
in the IMAGEN dataset (Dataset 8), 49 showed a sig-
nificant correlation (P 5 0.05) between regional variability
and regional RIIC, with 40 (28%) showing significant
negative correlation (r = �0.28 � 0.0032; Fig. 3A and E).
Therefore,
the
more
intra-community
connections
a
region has (relative to its inter-community connections),
the smaller its variability will be. A brain region with
more fibre connections to those of the same community
would be involved more stably in that functional commu-
nity, thus showing less variability. In comparison, a brain
region structurally connected to regions belonging to many
other communities will switch among them, i.e. the region
belongs to different functional communities at different
times, resulting in high variability.
Disease-specific changes of variability
in mental disorders
Next, we performed a whole-brain variability analysis in
patients with schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorders
(ASD) and ADHD and identified disease-specific changes
by comparing them to matched healthy controls. For dis-
orders with more than one dataset, meta-analysis was
adopted to integrate results from multiple datasets. For
schizophrenia, 420% of brain regions (n = 19) showed sig-
nificant differences in variability (Fig. 4A and Table 2).
Variability decreased mainly in DMNs, such as rectus,
hippocampus, parahippocampus, inferior parietal gyrus
and temporal lobe (middle temporal pole and inferior tem-
poral gurus), while it increased most prominently in sub-
cortical areas such as the thalamus, pallidum and putamen,
and the visual cortex (superior occipital and lingual gyrus).
Thalamic variability was associated with positive and gen-
eral symptom scores, while variability in visual areas cor-
related with general symptoms such as poor impulse
control and preoccupation (Table 3).
For autism patients, all regions showing significant changes
had higher variability when compared to healthy controls,
most significantly in the medial orbital and superior medial
frontal gyrus, rectus and angular gyrus (Fig. 4B and Table 2).
In particular, the variability of these default network regions
was positively associated with the restricted, repetitive and
stereotyped patterns of behaviour subscore (Table 3).
For ADHD patients, DMN regions involving the poster-
ior cingulate cortex and angular gyrus all showed higher
variability. In contrast, brain regions in the subcortical net-
work, i.e. thalamus, showed lower variability in patients
with
ADHD
compared
to
healthy
control
subjects
(Fig. 4C and Table 2). Variability changes in posterior cin-
gulate and frontal regions were associated with the severity
of ADHD symptoms (Table 3).
Discussion
Brain regions with highest and lowest
variability in healthy control subjects
We find that both primary sensory cortex and unimodal
association cortex show very low variability because these
regions are involved in unitary neural circuitry responsible
for simple sensory functions. These regions are usually
structurally connected more with regions belonging to the
same modality (i.e. the same functional module) and their
variability is small. In comparison, the transmodal areas
(Mesulam, 1998), including the heteromodal association
cortex and limbic regions, demonstrate high variability.
These regions receive information from multiple sensory
modalities and other heteromodal regions and are therefore
responsible for more complex, integrated cognitive activ-
ities
(Pearlson
et
al.,
1996;
Bullard
et
al.,
2013).
Consequently, these regions may participate in multiple
functional communities at different times with resultant
high temporal variability, or flexibility. Our results from
resting state functional MRI are consistent with those ob-
tained in task functional MRI by Bassett et al. (2013), who
found that in a motor learning task primary sensorimotor
and visual areas reconfigure little over time, while multi-
modal association regions reconfigure frequently.
Lastly, we note the relatively low variability of the DMN,
including medial frontal gyrus and posterior cingulate/pre-
cuneus, which is consistent with the strong functional con-
nectivity within this network during resting state. These
results are also in agreement with Power et al. (2011),
who suggested that sensory-motor, visual and default
mode systems are rather stationary.
Neural, electrophysiological and
anatomical basis of variability
In terms of defining the neural basis of variability, Fig. 3
and Supplementary Table 4 show a negative correlation
between the variability of a region and its BOLD activity/
node degree. This indicated that the variability of a re-
gion is modulated by its BOLD activity. To facilitate in-
formation transmission with other regions, it is natural for
a brain region to demonstrate greater BOLD activity to
allow for high-level functional integration with other re-
gions. Under these circumstances, this region will also
have a high level of functional connectivity with other
regions and, hence, higher degree. In this case, the tem-
poral variability of the region of interest is expected to be
low to maintain a high level of information transmission
and functional integration. These results are consistent
with
previous
studies
(Bassett
et
al.,
2012;
Zalesky
et al., 2012; Yu et al., 2013), which showed that activity

 and connectivity are related to one another in the resting
state.
The negative correlation between the variability of a
region of interest and the low frequency component of its
BOLD signal (see Supplementary Fig. 5D, E and F and
Supplementary Table 4) suggests that the low-frequency
BOLD oscillation of a region facilitates information trans-
mission
and functional
integration.
This
is
essentially
because
regions
with
more
low-frequency
components
tend to synchronize more easily with other regions and
thus have lower temporal variability. It is also consistent
with the finding that low-frequency oscillations allow for
integration
of
large
neuronal
networks
(Buzsaki
and
Draguhn, 2004). In contrast, a region with more high-fre-
quency components usually cannot synchronize effectively
with other regions, thus demonstrating high variability.

 For the electrophysiological basis of variability, the vari-
ability of a region was modulated by the � band power of
its EEG, as manifested by a positive correlation between
variability of a region and its � power during the entire
scan (Fig. 3A, C and Supplementary Table 5) across brain
regions. This is consistent with the finding that � oscillation
inhibits BOLD activity by showing a strong negative cor-
relation with BOLD activity, especially in occipital, parietal
and frontal cortices (Laufs et al., 2006; de Munck et al.,
2007). In view of our finding that there is a negative cor-
relation between BOLD activity and temporal variability
(Fig. 3A and B), the observed positive correlation between
� power and variability is therefore expected. Our results
are based on correlation analysis across brain regions
for each subject. In comparison, Chang et al. (2013) per-
formed a correlation analysis across subjects for a given
functional connectivity (i.e. between default-mode and
dorsal attention networks). Further studies investigating
correlation between brain network variability and EEG sig-
nals at different bands (both across subjects and across
brain regions) are needed to provide a full understanding
of the electrophysiological basis of variability (Thompson
et al., 2015).
In terms of the structural basis of variability, we found a
negative correlation between variability and the ratio of
intra- to inter-community structural connections (Fig. 3A
and E). Thus, if a region is more structurally connected
to nodes of the same functional community, then it will
be more stably involved with this community and exhibit
lower variability. In comparison, a region with structural
connections to multiple communities would tend to fre-
quently switch functional communities and demonstrate
high variability.
As the resting state is a unconstrained condition that
involves varying levels of mind-wandering, arousal, at-
tention and vigilance (Chang and Glover, 2010), the

 temporal variability of functional brain networks derived
from the BOLD functional MRI may be driven ultimately
by changes in mental state. Further investigations are
needed to explore how different levels of vigilance/
mind-wandering can modulate BOLD/EEG activity and,
in turn, the temporal variability of functional brain
networks.
Disease-specific changes of variability
Resting state functional connectivity analysis has revealed
changes in the intrinsic topographical organization of the
brain in many psychiatric disorders, including schizophre-
nia, autism and ADHD (Castellanos et al., 2008; Kennedy
and Courchesne, 2008; Bassett et al., 2012; Whitfield-
Gabrieli and Ford, 2012). However, time-varying proper-
ties of brain networks in general mental disorders have
been less investigated (Damaraju et al., 2014; Schaefer
et al., 2014; Yu et al., 2015). Our work has demonstrated
disease-specific changes of variability in three mental dis-
orders, which may provide clues to the dynamics under-
lying neuropathological profiles of different psychiatric
disorders and thereby contribute to the development of dif-
ferential and diagnostic imaging.
Previous studies in schizophrenia have reported a hyper-
activated
and
concomitantly
hyper-connected
DMN
(Whitfield-Gabrieli et al., 2009), which may mirror inten-
sive self-reference and decreased attentional capacities in
patients (Whitfield-Gabrieli et al., 2009). In line with
these
findings,
patients
with
schizophrenia
exhibited
decreased variability in those DMN regions associated
with increased activity and connectivity in this disorder.
Interaction between the DMN and task-positive networks
is related to working memory and switching between an
intrinsic and an extrinsic focus of attention (Weissman
et
al.,
2006;
Whitfield-Gabrieli
and
Ford,
2012).
Therefore, decreased DMN variability is associated with
neurocognitive symptoms characteristic of schizophrenia,
e.g. an exaggerated focus on one’s own thoughts and a
blurring of the boundary between internal and external
worlds (Whitfield-Gabrieli et al., 2009). Schizophrenia
also demonstrates basic information processing deficits,
particularly sensory gating (Bender et al., 2007) associated
with the thalamus. Increased variability in patients with
schizophrenia in subcortical regions (such as thalamus,

 putamen, and pallidum; see Table 2) could therefore point
to desynchronized basic filter modules associated with an
inability to filter out irrelevant stimuli and a correspond-
ingly diminished ability to focus attention (Freedman et al.,
1987). This is consistent with a recent study that reported
hypo-connectivity of the putamen using a dynamic analysis
(Damaraju et al., 2014).
For autisms, a number of studies have found reduced
DMN
connectivity
and
activity
(Kennedy
and
Courchesne, 2008) in resting state, which corresponds to
the high variability of DMN regions we have observed.
High variability in the DMN network suggests low func-
tionality,
i.e.
disruption
of
resting
state
default-mode
mediated cognition, which is mainly related to self-referen-
tial and theory of mind processing, inner speech, retrieving
and manipulating memories, and future plans (Greicius
et al., 2003; Kennedy et al., 2006; Garrity et al., 2007).
Therefore,
self-referential
thought
may
be
reduced
in
autism (Cherkassky et al., 2006) and directed more to-
wards obsessive interests and sensory-environment process-
ing
than
towards
self-reflective
activities
(Crespi
and
Badcock, 2008).
Temporal variability analysis in ADHD patients revealed
increased variability in regions of the DMN and concomi-
tantly decreased variability in subcortical regions. Previous
studies have also reported decreased DMN connectivity
and integration (Castellanos et al., 2008) in ADHD, as
explained by the ‘default-mode interference’ hypothesis
(Sonuga-Barke and Castellanos, 2007; Castellanos et al.,
2008). This theory suggests that the characteristic pattern
of variability in performance in ADHD could be based on a
dysfunctional synchronization in the DMN or its inter-
actions with ‘task-active’ regions, e.g. decreased anti-correl-
ations
between
the
PCC
and
task-positive
regions
(Castellanos et al., 2008). This is consistent with our find-
ing of high variability in DMN regions such as the poster-
ior
cingulate
in
association
with
low
functional
connectivity, and may reflect default mode interference
that contributes to attentional deficits in ADHD. In particu-
lar, the high variability associated with the posterior cingu-
late may be related its diminished volume (Carmona et al.,
2005) or decreased cortical thickness (Makris et al., 2007)
in ADHD, as well as in the precuneus.
Two interesting trends are worth noting. First, regions
demonstrating
extreme
variability
(either
highest
or
lowest) in healthy controls are those most subject to
change in mental disorders. As is shown in Table 2, half
of the regions showing significant variability changes in the
three disorders are among the top 10% of regions that
have the highest or lowest variability in matched controls
(11/19 in schizophrenia, 3/8 in autism, and 4/10 in
ADHD). This indicates that regions at the two extremes
of the axis of variability are unstable and tend to be af-
fected by mental disorders. We find that regions with high-
est variability in controls (transmodal areas) always show a
decrease in variability in disorders while regions with
lowest variability in controls (primary sensory regions)
tend to show an increase in disorders, suggesting abnormal
functional integration tend to occur in primary sensory re-
gions and transmodal areas in mental disorders.
Second, the three disorders studied showed a disease-spe-
cific and partly opposing pattern of altered variability in
regions previously reported to be associated with symp-
toms. For example, schizophrenia and autism demonstrate
opposing trends in variability changes in DMN regions
compared with respective controls (Fig. 4 and Table 4),
with posterior DMN regions affected in schizophrenia
and anterior DMN regions affected in autism. This is con-
sistent with the idea that schizophrenia and autism may
represent contrasting pathologies (Crespi and Badcock,
2008).
These
disorders
exhibit
diametrically
opposed
phenotypes, or patterns of social brain development, such
as social cognition, language, and behaviour, as well as
local/global processing. Social cognition is thought to be
underdeveloped in autistic-spectrum disorders, but hyper-
developed in the psychotic spectrum (Crespi and Badcock,
2008). In addition, an opposing trend was also observed
for variability changes in thalamus for schizophrenia and
ADHD (Fig. 4 and Table 4).
Finally, although both autism and ADHD demonstrate
changes in variability in DMN regions, the former involves
mainly medial frontal areas, while the latter includes the
Table 4 Disease-specific changes of variability for regions belonging to the DMN and subcortical
areas for schizophrenia, autism and ADHD

 posterior cingulate. Autism spectrum disorders are charac-
terized by deficits or inability to relate to other people and
understand others’ mental states (Assaf et al., 2010). These
theory of mind processes are supported by DMN activity,
especially by the medial prefrontal cortex (Assaf et al., 2010).
The higher variability in medial frontal regions identified in
autism indicates the low functionality of these regions, which
may underlie the undermined theory of mind processes in
autisms. In comparison, posterior cingulate dysfunction in
ADHD is responsible for the disruption of the DMN that
leads to attentional lapses (Leech and Sharp, 2014)
Relationship between variability and
other measures and potential
applications
We found that the temporal variability defined here is
related to the concept of functional brain entropy proposed
in our previous research (Yao et al., 2013). Where a brain
region exhibits large functional entropy this indicates a
wider distribution of all its functional connections. In this
case the region tends to maintain relatively high functional
connectivity with many other regions (i.e. high network
degree) and therefore demonstrates low temporal variabil-
ity. Interestingly, regions showing a significant trend to-
wards increased entropy with age, such as hippocampus/
parahippocampal gyrus, olfactory cortex, and paracentral
lobule, all have high temporal variability. On the other
hand, regions demonstrating decreased entropy with age,
such as the insular, have low temporal variability.
Bassett et al. (2011) have shown that flexibility of the
brain is an important factor that predicts learning, and
found correlations between the ability for the brain to
learn and its flexibility (Bassett et al., 2011, 2013, 2015).
This suggests that the more often the brain switches con-
nectivity patterns (i.e. more variable), the more flexible it is.
Therefore, the temporal variability measure proposed in our
paper may be a suitable indicator of the flexibility of a brain
region, and could potentially be used to predict the outcome
of learning. Our measure of brain variability may also have
implications in rehabilitation, e.g. for patients who have had
a stroke or glioma, or general brain injury. A brain region
with more variability in global functional connectivity profile
after brain injuries suggests its ability to participate in mul-
tiple communities, or neural systems, therefore this region is
more likely to restore its function after rehabilitation or sur-
gery. The variability measure proposed here consequently is
also expected to reflect plasticity of the brain.
The influence of head movements
While it has been shown that head movements can in-
fluence estimates of functional connectivity (Satterthwaite
et al., 2013; Power et al., 2014), evidence also indicates
that head movement only explains a small fraction of
the variability in connectivity (Van Dijk et al., 2012).
Motion-associated differences in functional connectivity
cannot be fully attributed to motion artefacts, but rather
also reflect individual variability in functional organization
(Zeng et al., 2014). To evaluate the possible effect of head
motion on temporal variability, we calculated the correl-
ation between variability of a region and the head move-
ments (Supplementary Table 6). Of the six functional MRI
datasets (Datasets 1–6), only the patients in Dataset 4
(ADHD: NYU) show significant correlation between re-
gional variability and head movement (nine regions sur-
vived correction; FDR, q = 0.05). We also listed regions
with P 5 0.01 (correlation between variability and head
movement) for other datasets in Supplementary Table 6,
and we found no consistent patterns across datasets.
These results suggest that the effect of head movement is
likely to be small and that the observed temporal variability
in brain networks we have observed cannot be attributed to

state (Allen et al., 2014). In the current study the NYU-

head movement was excluded from our analysis.
