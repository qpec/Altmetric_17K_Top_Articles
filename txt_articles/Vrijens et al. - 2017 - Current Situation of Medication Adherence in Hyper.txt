Despite increased awareness, poor adherence to treatments for chronic diseases
remains a global problem. Adherence issues are common in patients taking
antihypertensive therapy and associated with increased risks of coronary and
cerebrovascular events. Whilst there has been a gradual trend toward improved
control of hypertension, the number of patients with blood pressure values above
goal has remained constant. This has both personal and economic consequences.
Medication adherence is a multifaceted issue and consists of three components:
initiation, implementation, and persistence. A combination of methods is recommended
to measure adherence, with electronic monitoring and drug measurement being the
most accurate. Pill burden, resulting from free combinations of blood pressure lowering
treatments, makes the daily routine of medication taking complex, which can be a
barrier to optimal adherence. Single-pill fixed-dose combinations simplify the habit of
medication taking and improve medication adherence. Re-packing of medication is also
being utilized as a method of improving adherence. This paper presents the outcomes
of discussions by a European group of experts on the current situation of medication
adherence in hypertension.

INTRODUCTION
Poor adherence to treatments for chronic diseases is a worldwide problem and was highlighted as a
problem of striking magnitude by the World Health Organization [WHO] (2003). Adherence is of
particular concern in hypertension, with about half of the patients prescribed an antihypertensive
drug stopping taking it within 1 year, in a longitudinal study of electronically compiled dosing
histories of 4783 patients (Vrijens et al., 2008). While, it is recognized that awareness of adherence
has increased in recent years, there is still a long way to go.
Adherence is key to therapeutic success; however, it is a multifaceted issue and should not
be considered as a dichotomous variable (adherent versus non-adherent). Interestingly, drug
adherence goes beyond pill consumption and is a reflection of healthy behavior (Simpson
et al., 2006). Medication adherence can be defined as the process by which patients takes their
medications as prescribed (Vrijens et al., 2012) and is a dynamic process that changes over time.
Adherence consists of three components, which need to be considered separately: (A) initiation,
(B) implementation, and (C) persistence (Figure 1; Vrijens et al., 2012). The concept of percentage

Medication Adherence in Hypertension
adherence is misleading as it does not reflect these three
components (Vrijens, 2016). Persistence with antihypertensive
treatment significantly reduces long-term cardiovascular risk
(Corrao et al., 2011).
Non-adherence occurs when a patient does not: initiate
a new prescription, implement as prescribed, or persist with
treatment (Figure 1). Failure of patients to fill prescriptions
when new medications are started has been shown to be as
high as 28% in an analysis of 195,930 electronic prescriptions
(Fischer et al., 2010). Suboptimal daily implementation of the
prescribed regimen was one of the most common factors for
poor adherence with once daily antihypertensive treatment in
a longitudinal database study (Vrijens et al., 2008). On any
day about 10% of the patients omitted their scheduled dose.
In a cohort of 16,907 patients prescribed oral medications for
one of a variety of medical conditions in 95 studies, almost
40% of participants had discontinued treatment by 1 year,
and 4% never initiated treatment (Blaschke et al., 2012). The
consequences of medication non-adherence are drugs not or
stopping working, or working partially or creating harm and
stopping working (Figure 1). Variable adherence also creates
drug-specific issues of periodic loss of effectiveness, occasional
toxicity, and eventually apparent drug resistance (Blaschke et al.,
2012). There is a need to understand the concept of a drug’
s
“
forgiveness”in order to improve understanding of adherence in
the future. A drug’
s “
forgiveness”is best described as the post-
dose duration of action minus the dosing frequency (Osterberg
et al., 2010).
Persistence and initiation are better in clinical trials than
in clinical practice; however, implementation is more of a
patient attribute and there is no difference in either setting.
The pharma model is changing from one dose fits all
toward personalized, precision and individualized medicine
(Personal Communication: Tufts Centre for the Study of Drug
Development, 2012), with adherence being a vital sign to measure
and manage (Figure 2). Adherence should also be incorporated as
a measure in drug development studies (phase II, III, and IV) in
line with how drug-related adverse events are currently recorded
including discontinuation (Vrijens and Urquhart, 2014). There
is also a unique opportunity to improve adherence at initiation

of treatment and for approximately 1 week after, and then at
treatment failure before escalating therapy. For example, a survey
of data collected from 23 community pharmacies in south east
England reported that 30% (67/226) of patients still taking a new
medication at 10 days were non-adherent (Barber et al., 2004).
Problems caused by medicines were categorized as: side effects,
difficulties with the practical aspects of taking the medication and
necessity concerns. This has led to an initiative by which patients
are encouraged to visit their community pharmacist in order to
support adherence.
A group of European clinicians and a biostatistician recently
met to discuss the current situation of medication adherence, its
economic consequences, management, and strategies to improve
adherence. This paper presents the outcome of those discussions
with particular reference to adherence to antihypertensive
medication.
ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES OF
NON-ADHERENCE
The costs of non-adherence to medication are both personal and
economic, with knock-on costs as a result of increased demands
for healthcare resources if there is deterioration in patients’
health (NICE, 2009). Lack of medication adherence is estimated
to cost European governments €
125 billion per year; and cost
arising due to complications of poor adherence represents 14%
of total healthcare expenditure in the United Kingdom’
s National
Health Service (EFPIA, 2013). It is recognized that payment for
drug treatment has some impact on drug adherence but doesn’
t
prevent non-adherence. In the US, the relationship between non-
adherence and associated costs has been depicted as a continuous
cycle, with poor medication adherence leading to poor health
outcomes, increased service utilization and health care costs,
which are passed on to the patient and then lead to further effects
on adherence (Iuga and McGuire, 2014).
The IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics, using a global
modeling approach, identified a $500 billion (€
455 billion) saving
across 186 countries with the responsible use of medicines (IMS,
2012). Responsible use of medicines implies that “
activities,
capabilities, and existing resources of health system stakeholders
are aligned to ensure patients receive the right medicines at the
right time, use them appropriately, and benefit from them”(IMS,
2012). About 8% of the global total health expenditure, could be
avoided from adherence to medicine (IMS, 2012).
Whilst a gradual trend to improve treatment of hypertension
has been seen in the UK between 2003 and 2011, the percentage
of patients who are hypertensive and uncontrolled has remained
consistent (Figure 3; Health Social Care Information Centre,
2015). In the UK the annual cost of medicine wastage in
primary care is estimated to be £300 million (€
333 million), with
£100–
150 million (€
111–
166.50 million) identified as avoidable,
according to research by York Health Economics Consortium,
The School of Pharmacy, University of London (2010). The
research also evaluated the cost of non-adherence in six long-
term conditions, including hypertension. Savings of just over
£100 million (€
111 million) per year could be achieved if 80%
of patients with hypertension were adherent with treatment
(York Health Economics Consortium, The School of Pharmacy,
University of London (2010)).

Medication Adherence in Hypertension
FIGURE 3 | Prevalence of hypertension and blood pressure control in UK between 2003 and 2014 (Health Social Care Information Centre, 2015). Blood
pressure was not measured in 2004.
The costs related to hypertension and the economic impact
of increasing adherence to antihypertensive therapy have been
investigated in five European countries (Italy, Germany, France,
Spain, and England), using a probabilistic prevalence-based
model, over a 10-year period (Mennini et al., 2015). This model
indicated that a total saving of €
332 million could be achieved
by increasing adherence to antihypertensive therapy to 70%.
Studies such as this can help inform decision makers and aid
understanding of the importance of adherence. It is important
to note that the adherence goal of ≥80% originally came from
pharmacy refill claims databases and is not necessarily valid in all
clinical situations, for example resistant hypertension, and does
not address the drug’
s forgiveness as described earlier.
Hypertension is a serious public health issue in low- to
middle-income countries (Nielsen et al., 2017), and affordability
of medication is an important consideration as this is a
problem for medication adherence (Choudhry et al., 2016).
A recent systematic review of the literature on non-adherence to
antihypertensive medication, among adults in low- and middle-
income countries, has highlighted that this is more problematic
in some parts of the world (Nielsen et al., 2017). Affordability
affects the treatment initiation and persistence components
of adherence, as patients who cannot afford the medications
typically do not buy them.
Treatment escalation is one of the drivers for increased
cost:
poor
adherence
leads
to
treatment
failure,
disease
progression and more complex treatments, which then lead
on to further impact adherence. Adherence is perceived by
payers to be associated with increased costs, and there is a
need to raise awareness that reimbursement to avoid treatment
escalation is beneficial, e.g., supporting ambulatory blood
pressure monitoring. Furthermore, most of the estimates of non-
adherence are top down and are not sequential in terms of time.
However, the key message remains that the number of patients
who are non-adherent is high and this jeopardizes the healthcare
budget.
MANAGEMENT OF ADHERENCE
Low adherence is the most common cause of apparent
resistant hypertension (Jung et al., 2013). Poor adherence to
antihypertensive therapy is associated with increased risks of
coronary and cerebrovascular events (Corrao et al., 2011). In
terms of the management of adherence the objective is to
achieve the best use, by patients, of appropriately prescribed
medicines in order to maximize the potential for benefit
and minimize the risk of harm (Vrijens et al., 2012). The
European Society of Hypertension (ESH)/European Society
of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines provide recommendations on
methods to improve adherence to physicians’
recommendations,
and adherence management is also becoming part of care
pathways (PriceWaterhouseCoopers, 2007; Mancia et al., 2013;
Heidbuchel et al., 2015); however, more global guidance that is
not disease specific is needed. Furthermore, the guidelines should
be more prescriptive and less generic.

Medication Adherence in Hypertension
FIGURE 4 | Non-invasive and invasive methods of measuring adherence.
Drug adherence problems are characterized by two major
patterns:
non-persistence
and
good
persistence
but
poor
implementation of the dosing regimen (primarily missed doses
and drug holidays). Identification of the problem is crucial as the
prevention strategy depends on the type of pattern. Suboptimal
implementation may lead to poor blood pressure control, which
in turn can lead to non-persistence (Blaschke et al., 2012).
In addition to determining whether drugs are taken, it is
important to assess drug adherence. The difficulty of accurately
assessing adherence is highlighted by a study by Meddings et al.
(2012) where primary care providers recognized non-adherence
for less than half of those patients who had significant gaps in
their refill history. Apps are a conceptual way to implement
adherence; however, there are too many, they work for a limited
time, are often generic and even if they provide feedback to the
healthcare provider they are too complicated. Adherence data is
needed at the point of care.
There are several non-invasive and invasive methods of
measuring adherence (Figure 4). There is no one gold standard
method of measuring adherence; a combination of methods
should be used to measure initiation, implementation and
persistence which should be individualized (Figure 1; Gupta
et al., 2010). The most accurate methods are electronic
monitoring and drug measurement. Electronic monitoring
consists of automatic compilation of drug dosing history data
that may be useful in the management of patients with
resistant hypertension (Burnier et al., 2001). The Medication
Event Monitoring System (MEMS
R
�) is an example of electronic
monitoring of adherence that records the date and time when the
package is opened to remove medication. Although not available
in all countries, they are recognized as an underutilized resource.
They have the advantage of being a dynamic measure, but do
not prove ingestion. Monitoring of drug levels has been shown
to improve blood pressure control at follow-up visits (Brinker
et al., 2014). Whilst blood or urine drug measurements prove

• Prepare Consensus Document and Practical Guidelines, share with General

• Interventions for information and motivation among the population (blood

network of dedicated outpatient care units
• Dialog with stake-holders
• Promote long-lasting anti-hypertensive drugs in mono and combination
therapy
• Promote therapeutic simplification
ingestion they are invasive, costly, and are very limited as they
do not reflect the behavior of medication taking. The Medication
Event Monitoring System (MEMS) is an example of an electronic
medication monitoring, measurement and adherence system.
A meta-analysis of the impact of different strategies to improve
adherence and blood pressure control found that collaboration
with healthcare partners has the greatest impact (Glynn et al.,
2010).
Other systems in development for monitoring adherence
include ingestible sensor systems combined with wireless
observed therapy (Belknap et al., 2013) and electronically
chipped packaging. It is anticipated that in the future, adherence
monitoring will become routine for chronic conditions at specific
time points, i.e., initiation and treatment failure.
STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE ADHERENCE
A number of different strategies can be used to improve
blood pressure control (Table 1; Volpe et al., 2012a,b, 2013).

Medication Adherence in Hypertension
Patients’preferences as to methods of improving adherence
remain an “
unknown, unknown.” The majority of patients
need combination therapy to achieve blood pressure control;
however, pill burden is associated with lower adherence
(Gerbino and Shoheiber, 2007). Dosing frequency is important
and can in cases of less frequent dosing lead to non-
intentional non-persistence. Treatment simplification is one
of the most straightforward ways to enhance adherence, by
facilitating implementation of the dosing regimen (Redon
et al., 2008; Burnier et al., 2009). Single-pill FDCs can reduce
pill burden and simplify treatment regimens (Mancia et al.,
2013). FDCs significantly improve adherence and improve
BP normalization ratios compared with free combinations
(Gupta et al., 2010; Sherrill et al., 2011). Efforts to take
advantage of the benefits of FDCs for improving adherence
include an angiotensin-receptor-blocker-based
hypertension
treatment platform. This is a practical tool which has been
devised to guide the use of single-pill FDCs containing
two- and even three drugs in clinical situations commonly
seen in hypertension (Volpe et al., 2014). FDCs can be
expensive in some countries and may constitute a barrier for
adherence.
Patients’awareness of their adherence patterns can change
their behavior (Vrijens et al., 2006). The key elements to
changing patients’
behavior include: education, motivation, and
measurement (Vrijens et al., 2014). Packaging is an underused
opportunity to effectively manage medication adherence. It has
a role to play in measurement and provision of information.
The ESH/ESC guidelines include reminder packaging as a
method of improving adherence to physicians’
recommendations
(Mancia et al., 2013). A real-world assessment of the impact of
reminder packaging in the US has shown that it can improve
rates of adherence and persistence to antihypertensive treatment
(Dupclay et al., 2012). A higher proportion of patients who
received their prescribed medication in reminder packaging
remained on treatment and were less likely to discontinue
therapy compared with the non-reminder packaging group. This
approach to improving adherence through improvements in
packaging is now being applied within Europe. Recently, Daiichi
Sankyo re-designed its hypertension medication packaging to
include the following features: top-opening to provide easy
access to medication, improve convenience, and hopefully lead
to patients keeping the packaging; an intake reminder inside
the box to reduce the risk of missing pills (it is important
to link an activity to the same time every day, to facilitate
patient engagement); instant weekday visibility, makes patients’
aware if they have missed a dose; digital patient product
information available via a QR-code provides access to relevant
information in an easy to read, legible format. Finally, a
blister reminder helps to prevent patients from running out of
medication.
Re-packing products in this way might be considered as a
major step in improving initiation, supporting implementation
and ultimately persistence to treatment. Other important
considerations to engage discussion between patients and health
care providers are: materials to support counseling; dummy
packaging. It is recognized that pharmaceutical manufacturers
could do more with regards to improving packaging of
medications; small changes may have a meaningful impact on
adherence.
CONCLUSION
The advent of uniquely powerful medicines and reliable means
to measure adherence highlights the importance of patient
adherence, particularly in hypertension. Patient-tailored and
measurement-guided interventions are required to achieve
sufficient adherence to therapeutic drug regimens. Achieving
satisfactory adherence may have far greater impact than any
other maneuver to improve antihypertensive treatments, and
healthcare systems must evolve to meet this challenge.
