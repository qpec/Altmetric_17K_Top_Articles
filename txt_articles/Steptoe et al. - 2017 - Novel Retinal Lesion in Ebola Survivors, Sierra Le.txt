 We conducted a case–control study in Freetown, Sierra 
Leone, to investigate ocular signs in Ebola virus disease 
(EVD) survivors. A total of 82 EVD survivors with ocular 
symptoms and 105 controls from asymptomatic civilian and 
military personnel and symptomatic eye clinic attendees un-
derwent ophthalmic examination, including widefield retinal 
imaging. Snellen visual acuity was <6/7.5 in 75.6% (97.5% 
CI 63%–85.7%) of EVD survivors and 75.5% (97.5% CI 
59.1%–87.9%) of controls. Unilateral white cataracts were 
present in 7.4% (97.5% CI 2.4%–16.7%) of EVD survivors 
and no controls. Aqueous humor from 2 EVD survivors with 
cataract but no anterior chamber inflammation were PCR-
negative for Zaire Ebola virus, permitting cataract surgery. 
A novel retinal lesion following the anatomic distribution of 
the optic nerve axons occurred in 14.6% (97.5% CI 7.1%–
25.6%) of EVD survivors and no controls, suggesting neu-
ronal transmission as a route of ocular entry.
T
he most recent Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak 
in West Africa is the largest outbreak in history. As 
of March 27, 2016, an estimated 3,956 persons in Sierra 
Leone had died from EVD, and 10,168 had survived (1). 
The scale of this epidemic has enabled the study of large 
numbers of survivors, facilitating the characterization of 
post-Ebola syndrome. Ocular symptoms have been report-
ed, with incidence among survivors ranging from 14% to 
60% (2–4). Evidence of acute uveitis on ophthalmic ex-
amination ranges from 18% to 58% (4–7). Classification of 
uveitis also varies and has been reported as 36%–62% ante-
rior, 3% intermediate, 26%–36% posterior, and 18%–25% 
panuveitis (4,8). However, little is known regarding the 
medium- to long-term visual outcome of survivors or the 
rates of background uveitis and chorioretinal lesions within 
the local population.
Two published cases (9–11) and 2 case series (7,12) 
included fundus imaging, which attribute a range of retinal 
lesions to Ebola uveitis. Fourteen weeks after EVD dis-
charge, a unilateral anterior hypertensive uveitis developed 
in 1 survivor and soon progressed into an aggressive anteri-
or scleritis and intermediate uveitis. Viable Zaire Ebola vi-
rus (EBOV) was detected from the aqueous humor 9 weeks 
after the clearance of viremia (9). The duration of EBOV 
ocular persistence remains unknown, although repeated 
aqueous humor testing in the same survivor was negative 
for EBOV by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-
PCR) 1 year later (10). Recurrences up to 13 months after 
EVD discharge have been reported, but confirmation of 
Ebola etiology through aqueous humor analysis was not 
conducted (7). Because of the unknown prevalence and 
duration of EBOV persistence in aqueous humor, survi-
vors’ access to cataract surgery is still restricted. Our study 
aimed to detect if any specific retinal signs can be attributed 
to past EVD in survivors, to describe the implications for 
visual acuity, and to assess for EBOV persistence in survi-
vors with cataracts amenable to cataract surgery where no 
intraocular inflammation was present.
Methods
Study Design
We conducted a case–control prospective study comparing 
ophthalmic findings between EVD survivors and a control 
group during January–June 2016. Reporting of the findings 
is in accordance with guidelines set forth in the Strengthen-
ing the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiol-
ogy (STROBE) statement (13).
Study Population
We searched a database of EVD survivors from the 2014–
2016 EVD epidemic who had attended the EVD survivors 
clinic at 34th Regiment Military Hospital in Freetown, Si-
erra Leone, for patients who had reported ophthalmic com-
plaints at any of their follow-up appointments (2). Patients

  Retinal Lesion in Ebola Survivors, Sierra Leone
were contacted by telephone and invited to attend the oph-
thalmology clinic for review. EVD survivors from other 
medical facilities in the region who had reported ophthal-
mic complaints also attended the clinic through word of 
mouth and electronic social media networking from other 
survivors. EVD survivor status was verified by the posses-
sion of a valid discharge certificate from an Ebola treatment 
center. Date of acute admission, date of discharge, and lo-
cation of the Ebola treatment center were recorded from 
each discharge certificate.
Controls were recruited from ophthalmically symp-
tomatic and asymptomatic local military personnel, their lo-
cal family members, and symptomatic civilians. Survivors 
and controls were invited to participate in English or Krio, 
as preferred, with local ophthalmic nurses acting as inter-
preters. Consent was confirmed by fingerprint or signature.
Ocular Examination
Data were collected on first visit. The onset and nature of 
ocular complaint, and any systemic complaints were re-
corded on a standardized form before examination. Patients 
underwent visual acuity testing with either Snellen or Il-
literate E-chart acuity methods. Snellen visual acuity was 
grouped into visual acuity ranges according to the Interna-
tional Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical 
Modification, and reported as patient’s best eye vision.
Ocular anterior chamber assessment was conducted 
with a table-mounted slit lamp by 3 local ophthalmic clini-
cal officers. The initial 35% of anterior chamber examina-
tions were supervised and verified by an ophthalmologist 
from the United Kingdom. Patient examinations thereaf-
ter were conducted by local clinical officers alone with a 
telecommunication link for advice if required. Assessment 
of anterior chamber inflammation was graded according to 
the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature criteria (14). 
Intraocular pressures were measured by automated pneu-
matic tonometry (Canon TX-F; Melville, NY, USA); if 
out of reference range, this measure was repeated by using 
Goldmann applanation tonometry.
Widefield retinal images were obtained from patients 
with the use of a nonmydriatic Daytona Scanning Laser 
Ophthalmoscope (fundus camera; Optos, Dunfermline, 
UK). Optical coherence tomography was undertaken 
with the use of a Topcon DRI Triton swept source opti-
cal coherence tomography (Topcon Corporation, Tokyo, 
Japan). Posterior subcapsular and cortical cataract were 
graded from a comparison of standard images used in the 
Lens Opacities Classification System III (15) and applied 
to acquired fundus images. White cataracts were identified 
during patient examination, and fundus imaging was not 
possible. Presence of signs in the vitreous indicative of in-
termediate uveitis were also recorded from scanning laser 
ophthalmoscope imaging.
All clinical and artifactual signs present on scanning 
laser ophthalmoscopic imaging and corresponding auto-
fluorescent imaging were recorded, grouped, and incor-
porated into an original classification form with associ-
ated standard images and descriptions (online Technical 
Appendix 1, https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/article/23/7/16-
1608-Techapp1.pdf). All images were graded for these fea-
tures by 2 independent, masked ophthalmologists from the 
United Kingdom with specialist interests in medical retina. 
Certainty of positive findings were quantified as “yes, defi-
nitely,” defined as >90% certainty, or “yes, questionably,” 
defined as >50% certainty. Mutual agreements of definite 
or probable certainty were counted. Where discordance ex-
isted between findings, a third independent consultant oph-
thalmologist made final arbitration.
Paracentesis of the anterior chamber was performed at 
a slit lamp with a sterile 30-gauge needle while the clini-
cian was wearing personal protective equipment. After in-
formed consent was obtained, the procedure was conducted 
on 2 patients with white cataracts but no clinical signs of 
anterior chamber inflammation. At the time of sampling, 
the 2 survivors were 430 and 482 days postdischarge from 
their respective Ebola treatment centers. By using an an-
terior chamber tap procedure protocol (online Technical 
Appendix 2, https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/article/23/7/16-
1608-Techapp2.pdf), 0.1 mL of aqueous humor was ob-
tained in both cases. Both specimens were delivered to the 
Public Health England laboratory (Makeni, Sierra Leone) 
for analysis for EBOV RNA on qRT-PCR assay. Testing 
was performed with the use of the standard institutional op-
erating protocols by clinical laboratory technologists who 
were trained in the safe handling of infectious pathogens.
Statistical Methods
We reported results per patient and grouped by subject by 
using IBM SPSS version 22 (http://www-01.ibm.com/sup-
port/docview.wss?uid=swg27038407). Where data were 
missing, we reduced the denominator for each variable. We 
double-checked 10% of data entry and found 0% transcrip-
tion errors. We calculated 97.5% CIs by using the exact 
binomial (Clopper-Pearson) method (16); no overlap be-
tween CIs indicates a statistically significant result. Fisher 
exact statistical value was calculated for significant results.
The study was approved by the Sierra Leone Ethics 
and Scientific Review Committee on January 29, 2016. In 
addition, the study was authorized by the Pharmacy Board 
of Sierra Leone.
Results
The numbers of patients recruited and examined at 34th 
Regiment Military Hospital were 82 EVD survivors (161 
eyes; 2 missing retina images and 1 prosthetic eye) and 105 
never-infected controls (208 eyes; 2 missing retinal images).

 RESEARCH
Male-to-female ratio was 1:1.48 of EVD survivors and 
1:0.64 of controls. Median age at time of ophthalmic exami-
nation was 28 years (interquartile range [IQR] 22–38 years) 
for EVD survivors and 41 years (IQR 30–48 years) for con-
trols. Median time from Ebola treatment unit discharge to 
ophthalmic examination for survivors was 411 days (n = 
70) (IQR 368–470 days). Ophthalmic examination findings 
were summarized for survivors and controls (Table).
We subclassified pigmented and nonpigmented retinal 
lesions into 10 discrete groups (online Technical Appendix 
1) and noted frequency of each lesion type (Figure 1). We 
found no occurrences of the retinal lesion documented in a 
previous case report (9) in this EVD survivor cohort. Only 
the type 6 subcategory of retinal lesion was observed exclu-
sively in EVD survivors, occurring in 12/82 (14.6% [97.5% 
CI 7.1%–25.6%]) EVD survivors and 0/105 controls (0%

  Retinal Lesion in Ebola Survivors, Sierra Leone
[97.5% CI 0%–4.1%]) (p<0.01). In 50% of EVD survivors, 
this type of lesion was observed bilaterally.
Two fundal distributions of type 6 lesions were evi-
dent: isolated or multifocal lesions in the peripheral retina 
or peripapillary lesions observed emanating from the optic 
disc (Figure 2). Each lesion shape was variable but often 
exhibited characteristic sharp angulations, resembling a 
diamond or wedge (Figure 3). Surrounding these lesions 
was a well-demarcated area of darkened retina in compar-
ison with the adjacent retina. Presence of any retinal le-
sions of types 1–10, excluding type 6, were observed in 
21/82 (25.6% [97.5% CI 15.5%–38%]) EVD survivors and 
25/105 (23.8% [97.5% CI 15.1%–34.4%]) controls.
The aqueous humor of 2 EVD survivors with white 
cataract and no anterior chamber inflammation was nega-
tive for EBOV RNA on qRT-PCR assay. Postprocedure 
conjunctival swabs also were negative. The aqueous humor 
sampling procedure was uncomplicated and well-tolerated. 
No complications were reported on follow up.
Discussion
This case–control study identified a novel retinal sign that 
appears to be specific to EVD survivors. This sign occurred 
among a local population with a high rate of background 
chorioretinal disease. Uveitis after EVD has been reported 
(3,8), and a recent case report included a published fundus 
image from a survivor with a chorioretinal lesion attributed 
to EVD (9). That patient went on to have panuveitis.
The retinal lesions specific to EVD survivors were lo-
cated either adjacent to the optic disc or in the fundus periph-
ery. In the 8 cases in which lesions appear adjacent to the 
optic disc, their curvilinear projections from the disc margin 
appear to align with the anatomic pathways of the retinal 
ganglion cell axons that constitute the optic nerve. This dis-
tribution suggests a neurotrophic spread into the eye from 
the optic nerve and along the retinal ganglion cell axons. 
The other possible mode of entry into the eye is hematolog-
ic. Although the retinal ganglion cell axons often have par-
allel curvatures around the retinal arcade vessels, the lesions 
clearly follow the nerve fiber distribution in the absence of 
major vessels (Figure 1, panels A and C). Furthermore, we 
have not found any signs suggestive of associated vascular 
involvement, such as vasculitis, vascular occlusions, retinal 
ischemia, or secondary neovascularization, to support a he-
matologic spread. Neurotrophic properties are increasingly 
being recognized in EBOV (18). West Nile virus disease, 
caused by a known neurotropic virus, is associated with reti-
nal lesions that follow a similar pattern of distribution to the 
pattern we have observed in our study (19).
Each Ebola lesion shape is variable, but a character-
istic angulated appearance often resembling a diamond or 
wedge shape appears unique (Figure 2). As far as we are

aware, the appearance of these lesions is not characteristic 
of any other retinal disease. The reason for the sharp angu-
lated appearance of these lesions might be explained by the 
tight triangular packing of the retinal cone mosaic (Figure 
3, panel D) (17,20). The regular pattern of the photorecep-
tor triangular mosaic is disrupted by larger blue cones (17) 
and diminishes with eccentricity (20), which might explain 
the variability in shape. Optical coherence tomography in-
dicates that these lesions are limited to the retina (Figure 
3, panel B), and the resemblance of the lesion shape to the 
photoreceptor mosaic suggests that the ganglion cell axons 
act merely as a means of transportation to the photoreceptor 
end target.
Despite the proximity of the lesions to the optic nerve 
head, we observed no optic nerve head swelling or pallor in 
our study. This fact is in contrast to the 10% of optic nerve 
swelling reported in 1 abstract (5), although the time from 
acute infection to ophthalmic examination in that case was 
not stated. This difference might be attributable to varying 
durations since acute infection, allowing for any potential 
disc swelling to resolve in our cohort, for whom the me-
dian time since discharge was 411 days. Further optic nerve 
functional assessment, such as visual field analysis or color 
vision testing, has yet to be conducted.
The Ebola retinal lesions did not affect visual acu-
ity. Overall, no difference was observed in uncorrected 
visual acuity between EVD survivors and controls. The 
most common cause of visual impairment in EVD survi-
vors was white cataract (7.3%), which was accompanied 
by hypotony (low intraocular pressure) in 80% of EVD 
survivors. Hypotony suggests inadequate aqueous humor 
production and can limit the visual potential of an eye 
through complications such as retinal folds at the macula 
(i.e., hypotensive maculopathy).
Concern exists about the safety of cataract surgery in 
EVD survivors in Sierra Leone because of the unknown 
duration of EBOV ocular persistence. A sample size of 2 
negative aqueous humor samples in this study is too small 
to make any definitive conclusions but shows that EBOV 
does not necessarily persist in aqueous humor in those with 
cataract but no ongoing intraocular inflammation. This find-
ing suggests that cataract surgery can be conducted safely, 
providing an opportunity to restore vision and remove the 
stigma of EVD survivor status associated with having a vis-
ible white cataract. At present, we would recommend that 
anterior chamber sampling with EBOV PCR and a negative 
result should precede cataract surgery. However, cataract 
surgery might be challenging and visual outcomes disap-
pointing in cases of secondary hypotony, which occurred 
in 80% of EVD survivors.
Before this study, only 1 aqueous humor sample had 
been obtained in an EVD survivor (9), enabling the de-
tection of viable EBOV in aqueous humor during acute 
uveitis 9 weeks after discharge from hospital (9). Virus 
persistence in aqueous humor has also been observed 
in uveitis after Marburg virus infection (21), becoming 
negative on being repeated at 10 weeks (22). In EVD and 
Marburg virus–associated uveitis, intraocular pressure 
was markedly elevated (9,21). Although Ebola-related 
acute uveitis has been reported to be associated with high 
intraocular pressure, we did not find any evidence of per-
sistently high intraocular pressure in survivors with Ebola 
retinal lesions.
Uveitis accounts for 24% of blindness in Sierra Leone 
and is second only to cataracts as the leading cause (23). 
A proportion of those cataracts might be a consequence of 
intraocular inflammation, especially in younger patients. 
Given the high endemic rates of parasitic, viral, and fungal

disease in the region, infectious uveitis is likely to have a 
higher prevalence than in Western populations (24). Nev-
ertheless, the proportion of controls with chorioretinal le-
sions and retinal vasculitis was surprising. Pigmented and 
atrophic chorioretinal scars not in keeping with the Ebola 
retinal lesions were no more common in EVD survivors 
than controls, and it is important not to attribute these find-
ings to EBOV infection in survivors documented in case 
series (7,12).
The leading cause of uveitis in Sierra Leone is oncho-
cerciasis, but this disease is in decline because of the sys-
tematic distribution of ivermectin to affected areas (25,26). 
The rate of other uveitis-associated blindness appears to be 
increasing in Sierra Leone (23). This study was conduct-
ed in Freetown, where the incidence of onchocerciasis is 
lower than in rural regions, and other causes are probably 
responsible. Toxoplasmosis accounted for 43% of symp-
tomatic cases of posterior uveitis in 1 study (27), and it 
was probably a common cause among the patients in our 
study, although no serologic testing for toxoplasmosis was 
available. HIV prevalence in persons >15 years of age in 
Sierra Leone was estimated to be 1.25% in 2015 (28). The 
Ebola outbreak disrupted the fragile health system, includ-
ing HIV reporting mechanisms and AIDS response (29). 
This HIV rate is still relatively low compared with many 
other African nations. Further diagnostic investigation is 
required to attempt to attribute causation to the various cho-
rioretinal lesions observed in this study. Geographic areas 
of retinal whitening (white without pressure) are thought 
to be normal variants (30,31). Areas of retinal darkening 
(dark without pressure) have previously been attributed to 
sickle cell disease (32). 
Our study is subject to 1 limitation with regard to the 
control group, who were selected opportunistically with un-
matched cases and controls, and differences in age and sex 
ratios between the groups. This fact reflects the difficulties 
and limitations of conducting research in the post-Ebola set-
ting in Freetown in 2016. The study was conducted in a mili-
tary hospital, which housed the Ebola treatment unit and the 
continuing EVD survivors clinic. The hospital also serves 
the local civilian community and a military barracks com-
munity. The use of a non-EVD control group, even with-
out matching, allowed a comparison in the fundus findings 
between post-EVD and control groups. We found a higher 
prevalence of retinal disease in the symptomatic clinic-at-
tending control group than in the asymptomatic population 
control group; both groups included some military mem-
bers of staff and families. This comparison allows us to be 
more positive about the specificity of the Ebola retinal le-
sion. Given our aim to compare EVD with non-EVD fundus 
findings, an age- and sex-matched population control group 
probably would not change the study conclusions.
EVD survivors were identified by the possession of 
an Ebola treatment center discharge certificate. Forgery of 
these certificates has been known given the free access to 
healthcare it confers. IgG confirmation of previous EBOV 
infection is planned for ongoing follow-up studies. Our 
study provides information on the medium-term ocular se-
quelae of EVD survivors with a median time of 411 days 
since hospital discharge. Our study does not provide data 
on acute uveitis and ocular disease in the immediate after-
math of EVD as reported elsewhere (2,4,6).
Although we can reasonably conclude the retinal 
lesions described in our study are sequelae of EVD, no

 RESEARCH
pre-EVD retinal imaging was available to conclusive-
ly identify the timing of acquisition of the lesions. Our 
control group demonstrates the common retinal signs 
and pathologies that are present in the population before 
 
Ebola exposure.
We have documented a novel retinal abnormality in 
EVD survivors that appears to be specific to EVD, al-
though the proportion in the cohort with the condition is 
small. The background prevalence of chorioretinal ab-
normalities, including scarring with pigmentation, in the 
population is high and should not be attributed to EVD. 
Although further studies with larger sample sizes are re-
quired, EBOV does not necessarily persist in the aqueous 
humor of those with cataracts and no ongoing intraocular 
inflammation. These initial results raise the possibility of 
safe cataract surgery for EVD survivors with no signs of 
ongoing intraocular inflammation.

EID SPOTLIGHT TOPIC
Ebola, previously known as Ebola hemorrhagic fever, is a rare and deadly disease 
caused by infection with one of the Ebola virus strains. Ebola can cause disease in 
humans and nonhuman primates (monkeys, gorillas, and chimpanzees).
Ebola is caused by infection with a virus of the family Filoviridae, genus Ebolavirus. 
There are five identified Ebola virus species, four of which are known to cause 
disease in humans. Ebola viruses are found in several African countries; they 
were first discovered in 1976 near the Ebola River in what is now the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo. Before the current outbreak, Ebola had appeared 
sporadically in Africa.
The natural reservoir host of Ebola virus remains unknown. However, on the basis 
of evidence and the nature of similar viruses, researchers believe that the virus 
is animal-borne and that bats are the most likely reservoir. Four of the five virus 
strains occur in an animal host native to Africa.
