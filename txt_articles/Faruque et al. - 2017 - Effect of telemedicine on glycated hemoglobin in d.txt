iabetes is one of the most common chronic diseases 
worldwide and is associated with premature death and 
disability. Over the past 3 decades, the prevalence of dia­
betes has more than doubled globally1 and is projected to rise fur­
ther from 382 million in 2013 to 592 million in 2035.2 Optimal gly­
cemic control helps to prevent and reduce complications of 
diabetes, including cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, blind­
ness, neuropathy and limb amputation.3,4 However, maintaining 
optimal glycemic control is challenging.5
Telemedicine is the use of telecommunications to deliver 
health services, including interactive, consultative and diagnostic 
services.6 Telemedicine interventions for diabetes can range from 
simple reminder systems via text messaging to complex Web inter­
faces through which patients can upload their glucose levels mea­
sured with a home meter and other pertinent data such as medica­
tions, dietary habits, activity level and medical history. Providers 
can review the data and provide feedback regarding medication 
adjustments and lifestyle modifications. Telemedicine has previ­
ously been shown to have clinical benefits for patients with severe 
asthma,7 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,8 hypertension9 or 
chronic heart failure.10 It may also be helpful for providing care to 
people with diabetes, especially those unable to travel to health 
care facilities owing to large distances or disabilities. In particular, 
telemedicine may facilitate self­management, an important po­
tential objective in diabetes care.11,12
Previous reviews describing the effect of telemedicine on the 
management of diabetes have been published.13–31 However, some 
focused on only specific types of telemedicine (e.g., telemonitor­
ing20,23,26) or interventions delivered only by telephone.16,17,23,31

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: Telemedicine, the use of 
telecommunications to deliver health 
services, expertise and information, is a 
promising but unproven tool for im­
proving the quality of diabetes care. We 
summarized the effectiveness of differ­
ent methods of telemedicine for the 
management of diabetes compared 
with usual care.
METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Em­
base and the Cochrane Central Register 
of Controlled Trials databases (to Novem­
ber 2015) and reference lists of existing 
systematic reviews for randomized con­
trolled trials (RCTs) comparing telemedi­
cine with usual care for adults with diabe­
tes. Two independent reviewers selected 
the studies and assessed risk of bias in 
the studies. The primary outcome was 
glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) reported at 
3 time points (≤ 3 mo, 4–12 mo and 
> 12 mo). Other outcomes were quality of 
life, mortality and episodes of hypoglyce­
mia. Trials were pooled using random­
effects meta­analysis, and heterogeneity 
was quantified using the I2 statistic.
RESULTS: From 3688 citations, we identi­
fied 111 eligible RCTs (n = 23 648). Tele­
medicine achieved significant but modest 
reductions in HbA1C in all 3 follow­up peri­
ods (difference in mean at ≤ 3 mo: −0.57%, 
95% confidence interval [CI] −0.74% to 
−0.40% [39 trials]; at 4–12 mo: −0.28%, 
95% CI −0.37% to −0.20% [87 trials]; and at 
> 12 mo: −0.26%, 95% CI −0.46% to 
−0.06% [5 trials]). Quantified heterogene­
ity (I2 statistic) was 75%, 69% and 58%, re­
spectively. In meta­regression analyses, 
the effect of telemedicine on HbA1C ap­
peared greatest in trials with higher HbA1C 
concentrations at baseline, in trials where 
providers used Web portals or text mes­
saging to communicate with patients and 
in trials where telemedicine facilitated 
medication adjustment. Telemedicine 
had no convincing effect on quality of life, 
mortality or hypoglycemia.
INTERPRETATION: Compared with usual 
care, the addition of telemedicine, espe­
cially systems that allowed medication 
adjustments with or without text mes­
saging or a Web portal, improved HbA1C 
but not other clinically relevant out­
comes among patients with diabetes.

tional clinical trials have recently been published, which suggests 
the value of an updated review. We did a systematic review and 
quantitative synthesis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) com­
paring the impact of different methods of telemedicine with usual 
care on glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) and health­related quality of 
life in people with diabetes mellitus.
Methods
We performed a systematic review of RCTs that compared telemedi­
cine with usual care for the management of diabetes (type 1 and 
type 2). The review was reported according to an accepted guide­
line.32 We followed a written but unregistered protocol.
We included studies if they were RCTs (parallel, cluster or cross­
over); were published in English; enrolled adult patients with diabe­
tes; compared telemedicine (some electronic form of provider­to­
patient communication) with usual care; and reported the degree of 
metabolic control measured by HbA1C level. We excluded studies on 
gestational diabetes because of the different nature of the disease. 
We considered peer­reviewed full­text articles published until 
November 2015.
Literature search
The search strategy was designed by an expert librarian. We 
searched the following electronic databases through the Ovid 
 
interface: MEDLINE (1946–November 2015), Embase (1974–
November 2015) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled 
Trials (November 2015). We also performed manual searches of 
the reference lists of existing systematic reviews. Because tele­
medicine is a broad term that can cover different interventions, we 
included all electronic forms of communication in our search. The 
search strategies are shown in Table A1 in Appendix 1 (available at 
www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.150885/­/DC1). Re­
sults of the search were transferred to Endnote software and were 
checked for duplicates.
Study selection
Two reviewers (N.W. and L.F.) independently screened the titles 
and abstracts of all unique citations. Studies with “diabetes,” 
“type 1” or “type 2” in the title or abstract that studied any kind of 
telemedicine intervention were selected for full­text review. Two 
independent reviewers (L.F. and a research assistant) assessed 
them using an inclusion/exclusion form based on a priori selection 
criteria for eligibility. Disagreements between the reviewers were 
resolved by meeting with a third reviewer (N.W.).
Data extraction
We used a standardized method to extract and record relevant 
properties of each trial into a database. Data from eligible trials 
were extracted by 1 reviewer (L.F.) and checked by another 
reviewer (Y.L.) using a standardized extraction sheet. We resolved 
disagreements by discussion. 
We extracted the following information from selected studies: 
trial characteristics (study name, year of publication, country, study 
design, duration and sample size); patient characteristics (age, sex, 
type of diabetes, diabetes duration, blood pressure, cholesterol, 
body mass index [BMI], smoking status and medications [insulin, 
oral  
hypoglycemic agents, lipid­lowering therapy]); telemedicine 
interventions; and outcomes. 
We classified the telemedicine interventions by (a) form of com­
munication from patient to provider, (b) form of communication 
from provider to patient, (c) type of provider (nurse, physician, 
allied health professional, clinical decision support system), (d) fre­
quency of contact and (e) characteristics of any intervention. Forms 
of communication between provider and patient included tele­
phone, smartphone application, email, text messaging (short mes­
sage service [SMS]), Web portal (websites where patients upload 
blood glucose levels or other clinical data and share these with 
their health care providers, with or without provider­to­patient 
communication) and “smart” device or glucometer (any computer­
ized device specifically developed to collect and transmit patients’ 
data to health care providers). Characteristics of any intervention 
included medication adjustment, exercise, general education 
about diabetes, blood pressure management and nutritional 
intervention.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was HbA1C level. Secondary outcomes were 
quality of life as measured by a validated instrument, mortality and 
incidence of hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemic events were classified as 
severe if they were reported as such or if they required assistance.
Risk-of-bias assessment
We assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane Collaboration’s tool33 
and included other items (funding, intention to treat and interim 
analysis) also known to be associated with bias.34–40 Two reviewers 
(L.F. and a research assistant) assessed the trials independently and 
resolved any disagreements by meeting with a third reviewer (N.W.).
Data synthesis and analysis
We used Stata 13 (StataCorp) for all statistical analyses. We used 
the difference in means (MD) to pool continuous outcomes, and the 
risk ratio or the risk difference (when the events were rare) to pool 
dichotomous outcomes. Because of the differences expected 
between trials, we combined results using a random­effects 
model.41 We imputed missing standard deviations by substituting 
the baseline value from the same intervention group whenever 
possible; otherwise the median value from the systematic review 
was substituted.42 We pooled outcomes using 3 categories of time 
points (≤ 3 mo, 4–12 mo and > 12 mo). Dichotomous outcomes of 
HbA1C were pooled by the floored threshold value (e.g., < 6%, < 7%, 
< 8%, < 9%). We reported results from a quality­of­life instrument 
when data from at least 2 trials could be pooled. Heterogeneity was 
identified by visual inspection of the forest plots and by quantifying 
I2 statistic.43 We assessed publication bias using the Egger test44 and 
by visual inspection of the contour­enhanced funnel plot.45
We planned a priori to examine the association between popu­
lation characteristics, intervention characteristics, risk­of­bias 
items (as specified earlier) and the effect of telemedicine on HbA1C 
for characteristics reported in 5 or more trials. We did univariable 
weighted (with the inverse of the trial variance) linear meta­regres­
sion to evaluate for effect modification on HbA1C at 4–12 months.46

In a post hoc analysis, we examined whether adjustment for 
potential confounders in the trial­level results modified the effect 
of telemedicine on HbA1C.
Results
Our literature search identified 3688 unique citations. After the 
screening of titles and abstracts, 517 potentially eligible studies were 
identified, of which 111 trials21,47–156 met our inclusion criteria (Figure 
1). Disagreements occurred with 7% of the articles (κ value = 0.82).
Characteristics of the trials are summarized in Table 1 (see end 
of article). Of the 111 included trials, 4 were published before 2000. 
Five were cluster RCTs, 3 were crossover trials, and the remainder 
were parallel RCTs. Forty­one trials (37%) were done in the United 
States, 14 (13%) in Korea and 7 (6%) each in Canada and Australia; 
6 or fewer were done in each of the remaining countries. 
The median number of study participants was 114 (range 
10–2378) (Table 1). The median mean age at baseline was 56 years, 
and the median mean BMI at baseline was 31. The range of meta­
bolic control at baseline varied substantially between trials (mean 
HbA1C 6.4%–10.9%); however, the mean HbA1C level in 71 (64%) of 
the trials was 8% or greater at baseline.
The telemedicine interventions varied in a number of ways 
between the trials (Table 2 [see end of article]). Patients initiated com­
munication with their health care providers in 3 ways: voice, text mes­
saging and transmission of data. The trials used a large variety of plat­
forms: Web portal (24%), customized “smart” device (14%), telephone 
for communication to provider (13%), smartphone application (8%), 
SMS (5%), email (3%), personal digital assistant (2%), automated 
voice reminder system (1%), computer software (1%), fax (1%), list­
serv (electronic mailing list to send group emails; 1%), customized 
patient­specific Web page (1%) or a call­me button (1%).
Health care providers initiated communication with patients in 
at least 4 ways: voice, text messaging, images and through clinical 
decision support systems. The platforms used were telephone 
(59%), clinical decision support system (32%; e.g., automated 
interactive voice [9%]), Web portal (22%), SMS (16%), email (7%), 
videoconference (4%), computer software (3%), customized 
“smart” device (3%), customized patient­specific Web page (2%), 
video message (2%), letter (2%), smartphone application (1%) or 
listserv (1%). Providers were nurses (37%), care managers (10%), 
diabetes educators (11%), physicians (29%), allied health profes­
sionals (17%; including dietitians, nutritionists, physiologists, exer­
cise trainers, psychologists and pharmacists), clinical decision sup­
port systems (32%) and nonspecialized support (23%; including 
trained peers, members of research teams, counsellors and com­
munity health care workers). 
Most (94%) of the interventions were interactive, whereby the 
patient could communicate with the provider, and the provider 
could communicate with the patient. Interactive telecommunica­
tion initiated by providers occurred in the following frequencies: at 
least daily (8%), weekly (26%), every 2 weeks (10%), monthly 
(16%) or less often (7%). Frequency of interaction was not 
reported in 33% of trials. Many of the interventions (45%) adjusted 
medication based on the data received. Other frequent compo­
nents of the interventions included general diabetes education 
(76%), nutritional interventions (53%), exercise (49%) and blood 
pressure management (9%).
The risk­of­bias assessment of the trials is shown in Figure 2 
and Table A2 in Appendix 1. Because blinding of participants is not 
feasible for telemedicine interventions, all trials were open label to 
the participants; thus, every trial included at least 1 element of risk 
of bias. However, we assessed for blinding of outcome assessors 
(present in 20% of trials). Seventy­eight trials (70%) reported and 
described an appropriate method of randomization, but only 30 
(27%) reported an adequate allocation concealment process. The 
intention­to­treat principle was applied in 51 (46%) of the trials. 
Public funding was exclusively used in 57 trials  (51%).
Effect on HbA1C
Thirty­nine trials (n = 3165) reported the effect of telemedicine on 
HbA1C at 3 months or less (Table 3 and Table A3 in Appendix 1). 
Eighty­seven trials (n = 15 524) reported HbA1C at 4–12 months, and 
5 trials (n = 1896) reported HbA1C beyond 12 months. The MDs were 
all significant and favoured telemedicine, although there was large 
heterogeneity (≤ 3 mo: −0.57%, 95% confidence interval [CI] −0.74% 
to −0.40%, I2 = 75%; 4–12 mo: −0.28%, 95% CI −0.37% to −0.20%, I2 = 
69% [Figure 3]; and > 12 mo: −0.26%, 95% CI −0.46% to –0.06%, I2 = 
58%). Inspection of the effect sizes identified 3 outlier trials87,98,154

for which effects were larger than in the other trials. Exclusion of 
these 3 trials did not materially affect our results for the primary 
outcome (HbA1C at 4–12 mo), but it did reduce heterogeneity 
(–0.24%, 95% CI –0.31% to –0.16%, I2 = 58%). Findings were similar 
when control of HbA1C was dichotomized at various thresholds 
(6.4%–6.5%, 7%–7.5%, 8% or 9%) and when we pooled results from 
the last time points from every available trial (Table A3 in Appen­
dix 1, and Appendix 2 [available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/
doi:10.1503/cmaj.150885/­/DC1]).
The contour funnel plot of HbA1C was asymmetrical, consistent 
with publication bias (more small studies favouring telemedicine) 
(Figure 4). The bias estimate from the regression analysis was signifi­
cant (Egger test: bias −0.95, p = 0.02). When the 3 outlier trials were 
removed, the bias estimate was not significant (bias −0.68, p = 0.07).
Meta-regression analysis
We explored a number of population and inter 
vention characteristics 
using univariable meta­regression (Table 4). Both trial region and 
baseline HbA1C modified the effect of telemedicine on final HbA1C, but 
mean age, percent male, diabetes duration, BMI, insulin use, use of 
oral hypoglycemic therapy and diabetes type did not. European (n = 
26) and North American trials (reference group, n = 47) reported simi­
lar MDs (difference in MD −0.08%, 95% CI −0.27% to 0.11%); however, 
trials from Asia (n = 9) reported significantly larger differences favour­
ing telemedicine relative to North American trials (difference in MD 
−0.49%, 95% CI −0.77% to −0.22%).
Because most telemedicine platforms were used in fewer than 5 
trials, it was not possible to use meta­regression to evaluate the rel­
ative merits of all platforms. Choice of patient­to­provider platform 
(smartphone application, Web portal, smart device, telephone) did 
not significantly modify the effect of telemedicine on HbA1C. How­
ever, choice of provider­to­patient platform (SMS text messaging, 
Web portal, clinical decision support system, telephone) signifi­
cantly influenced the association between telemedicine and HbA1C, 
with both SMS text messaging and Web portal associated with 
greater benefit than telephone­based systems (difference in MD: 
SMS v. telephone −0.28%, 95% CI −0.52% to −0.05%; Web portal v. 
telephone −0.35%, 95% CI −0.56% to −0.14%). Interventions in 
which providers adjusted medication in response to data from 
patients were also associated with larger improvements in HbA1C 
(−0.23%, 95% CI −0.42% to −0.05%). Inclusion of interactive com­
munication, exercise, general diabetes education, blood pressure 
management or nutritional interventions did not modify the bene­
fit of telemedicine on HbA1C. Frequency of contact and type of pro­
vider did not significantly modify the association.
None of the items from the Cochrane risk­of­bias tool were sig­
nificant effect modifiers, except for reporting loss to follow­up. Tri­
als that partially reported loss to follow­up (i.e., no stated reasons 
for loss to follow­up, or loss was reported for the whole trial and 
not by group) showed a smaller difference in HbA1C than trials with 
fully reported loss to follow­up or trials that did not report loss to 
follow­up (difference in MD 0.30%, 95% CI 0.11% to 0.48%). 
Because there was no gradient of effect, there was no evidence 
that reporting versus not reporting loss to follow­up was a signifi­
cant effect modifier.
Effect on quality of life and mortality
Few trials (27 trials) reported on quality of life. Among the 23 trials 
that reported an instrument used by at least one other trial, a total 
of 6 instruments were validated (Table 3). Telemedicine led to sig­

at 4–12 mo: 2.86, 95% CI 1.74 to 3.97, I2 = 0%, 2 trials, n = 363). 
Three scores or subscores showed significant worsening (SF­36 
physical functioning ≤ 3 mo: MD −3.98, 95% CI −0.62 to −7.34, I2 = 
30%, 2 trials, n = 311; SF­36 social functioning ≤ 3 mo: MD −2.22, 
95% CI −0.10 to −4.34, I2 = 0%, 2 trials, n = 311; and EQ­5D at 4–12 
mo: MD −0.01, 95% CI −0.01 to −0.01, 2 trials, n = 743). There was no 
evidence of selective reporting of subscores for quality of life. 
However, the effect of telemedicine was not significant for most 
subscores, and the few statistically significant differences were 
likely not clinically relevant.157
We pooled the mental health and physical health component 
summaries of the SF­36 and SF­12 instruments from 7 trials (n = 
1333): MD 0.55 (95% CI −0.83 to 1.92; I2 = 29%) and 0.06 (95% CI −1.01 
to 1.13; I2 = 0%), respectively. We also pooled the global scores (after 
transformation to a 1–100 range, where 100 was optimal) from all 
3 diabetes­specific instruments from 8 trials (14 within­trial sub­
groups, n = 1324): MD 0.86 (95% CI −0.73 to 2.45; I2 = 23%). Because 
all of these findings were nonsignificant,157 there was no evidence to 
suggest that telemedicine enhanced quality of life.
Eleven trials (n = 1361) reported all­cause mortality within 3 
months, 42 trials (n = 7197) reported mortality at 4–12 months, and 
4 trials (n = 2376) reported mortality beyond 12 months. The risk 
differences were all nonsignificant, without evidence of heteroge­
neity (≤ 3 mo: 0.2%, 95% CI −0.6% to 0.9%, I2 = 0%, 6 deaths; 4–12 
mo: −0.2%, 95% CI −0.6% to 0.2%, I2 = 0%, 68 deaths; and > 12 mo: 
−0.3%, 95% CI −1.6% to 1.0%, I2 = 0%, 351 deaths).
Effect on hypoglycemia
Five trials (n = 462) reported participants with hypoglycemic episodes 
within 3 months, and 4 trials (n = 282) reported participants with 
hypoglycemia at 4–12 months (Table 3). One trial (n = 92) reported 
participants with severe hypoglycemia within 3 months, and 10 trials 
(n = 1259) reported participants with severe hypoglycemia at 4–12 
months. There was no evidence that telemedicine reduced the risk of 
hypoglycemic episodes (risk difference for hypoglycemic episodes ≤ 
3 mo: 0.0%, 95% CI −5.5% to 5.5%, I2 = 63%; and at 4–12 mo: 3.1%, 
95% CI −7.9% to 14.2%, I2 = 47%). Risk differences for severe hypogly­
cemia were also not significant (≤ 3 mo: 0.0%, 95% CI −4.2% to 4.2%; 
and at 4–12 mo: −0.1%, 95% CI −1.0% to 0.8%, I2 = 0%).

Interpretation
Compared with usual care, the addition of telemedicine appeared 
to improve HbA1C significantly in people with either type 1 or 2 dia­
betes. Although there was substantial heterogeneity, the pooled 
analyses showed that telemedicine lowered HbA1C by 0.57% within 
3 months and by 0.28% beyond 4 months. The lower apparent 
magnitude of benefit with longer follow­up may reflect reduced 
adherence to the intervention. Nonetheless, the effect on HbA1C 
appears clinically relevant and is comparable to improvements 
associated with some oral antidiabetic agents (0.5%–1.25%),158 
psychosocial interventions (0.6%, 95% CI −1.2% to −0.1%)159 or 
quality improvement strategies (0.42%, 95% CI 0.29% to 0.54%)160 
among patients with diabetes. However, we did not find good evi­
dence that telemedicine reduced the risk of hypoglycemia, quality 
of life or mortality, although it is unlikely that benefits for the latter 
would have been observed given the short duration of the 
included trials. Although telemedicine may also improve patient 
satisfaction with care, we did not collect data to test this hypothe­
sis, and thus this suggested benefit is speculative.
The meta­regression analyses suggested that telemedicine inter­
ventions that facilitated medication adjustments were more effec­
tive in improving glycemic control than interventions that did not al­
low such adjustements. This finding is consistent with medication 
adjustment by nurse or pharmacist (0.23%, 95% CI 0.05% to 0.42%) 
reported in a previous meta­regression analysis of quality improve­
ment strategies, including case man­
agement.160 Our findings suggest that 
text messaging and Web portals may 
be especially effective mechanisms for 
linking providers to patients with dia­
betes. The use of SMS text messaging 
may be feasible to communicate and 
motivate patients, which could result 
in positive outcomes.134 Although the 
trials we studied required providers to 
generate the text messages, it may 
prove feasible and less expensive to 
generate such messages by means of 
automated algorithms.92
There are various types of telemedi­
cine interventions, including telehealth 
(clinical services provided at a dis­
tance6), telecare (often applied to non­
clinical aspects of care such as mobility 
and safety27) and telemonitoring (re­
mote collection and transmission of 
clinical data from patients to provid­
ers161). We primarily included trials in 
which patients received clinical feed­
back or communication from providers 
using some technology or devices. 
Therefore, we cannot differentiate trials 
that focused on telemonitoring or tele­
care in our review. Among the included 
trials, telemedicine  
interventions 
ranged from simple messages providing generic management sug­
gestions for patients52,134 to more comprehensive interventions per­
mitting videoconferencing with a nurse case manager, and remote 
monitoring of glucose and blood pressure with electronic data cap­
tured in the electronic medical record.133 This wide variation in inter­
ventions likely contributed to some of the observed heterogeneity, 
which was only partly explained by meta­regression.
Although our study is, to our knowledge, more comprehen­
sive than previous studies of telemedicine in diabetes, our re­
sults are generally consistent with prior work showing beneficial 
effects of telemedicine on HbA1C. Compared with other system­
atic reviews, the relatively large number of studies that we iden­
tified allowed more detailed exploration of factors that may in­
fluence the magnitude of benefits on HbA1C. We were also able to 
show that effects on HbA1C diminished but were sustained over 
time and that benefits were more pronounced with more interac­
tive interventions (e.g., Web portals and text messaging).
Limitations
Weaknesses of our systematic review include limitations of the 
constituent trials (small sample size, lack of blinding and rela­
tively short duration). However, evidence suggests that lack of 
blinding would be less likely to affect an objectively assessed out­
come such as HbA1C.162 
Second, there was considerable variation in the types of tele­
medicine technology used, the type of care the control groups

Figure 4: Contour funnel plot using glycated hemoglobin levels at 4–12 months. Each trial’s precision (the 
inverse of the standard error of each study’s effect estimate) is plotted against each trials’s effect estimate. 
This funnel plot appears mildly asymmetric about the vertical dashed line (the fixed­effects pooled esti­
mate). There are 3 statistical outliers that appear in the far right of the plot. The emptier left side of the 
inverted funnel may indicate small missing studies. Because most of these missing studies would be within 
the white region, they would be nonsignificant, which would indicate publication bias rather than some 
form of heterogeneity.

received and the populations studied. The variation may have con­
tributed to the observed heterogeneity, and it may explain why 
some trials found positive effects of telemedicine and others found 
no benefit. However, we used meta­regression to identify which 
types of telemedicine interventions were particularly efficacious. 
The potential benefits of SMS text messaging and Web portals 
when used in conjunction with tailored (patient­specific) sugges­
tions for medication adjustment suggest that these forms of inter­
vention should be the highest priority for future uptake.
Third, as with all meta­regression analyses using summary data 
rather than individual participant data, our findings are vulnerable 
to the ecological fallacy (i.e., findings at the population level do 
not always translate correctly to individuals) and from limited sta­
tistical power.
Fourth, we did not collect data on the effects of telemedicine 
on satisfaction of care or its cost­effectiveness.163 
Finally, we found some evidence of publication bias, which sug­
gests that some small negative trials might exist, but they were not

identified by our literature search. If this supposition were correct, it 
might lead to a slight overestimation of the efficacy of telemedicine 
interventions, but it would likely not affect our conclusion given that 
elimination of the outliers removed any significant publication bias.
Conclusion
Our systematic review showed that telemedicine may be a useful 
supplement to usual clinical care to control HbA1C, at least in the 
short term. Telemedicine interventions appeared to be most effec­
tive when they use a more interactive format, such as a Web portal 
or text messaging, to help patients with self­management.

Note: CDSS = clinical decision support system, NA = not applicable, PCP = primary care provider, PDA = personal digital assistant, SMS = short message service (text messaging),  
“–” = not reported.
*Studies are ordered by provider­to­patient communication; they are ordered by any use of Web portals, SMS text messaging, automated communication, smart device, computer 
software, videoconference, email, customized patient Web pages, video messaging, smartphone application, telephone and letter. A smart device is any computerized device 
specifically developed to collect and transmit patient data to health care providers. Web portals are websites where patients upload blood glucose or other clinical data and share 
these with their health care providers; many times providers also use Web portals to provide feedback to patients. CDSS systems receive data from patients and automatically 
respond using computer algorithms in a variety of ways, such as precomposed messages sent as SMS text messages to patients (Kim 201095), alarms sent to the providers when 
abnormal data are received (Gomez78), analyzed data reports sent to providers (Quinn125) and voice feedback over the telephone to patients (Schillinger131). Other components not 
mentioned in this table include psychological support, such as support for depression, smoking cessation and behavioural therapy.
†Indicates an approximate frequency of feedback. For example, we used "~ daily" rather than 3 times per week for Lim102; "~ every 2 wk" replaced 14 times per 6 months for Eakin,67 
and 11 times per 6 months for Munshi;112 "~ monthly" replaced 5 times per 6 months for Blackberry55 and Frosch,73 and 10 times per year for Walker;147 and "~ every 2 mo" replaced 
every 7 weeks for Young.155
