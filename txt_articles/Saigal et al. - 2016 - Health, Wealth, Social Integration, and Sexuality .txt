IMPORTANCE Although it has been previously reported that the transition of extremely
low-birth-weight survivors (�1000 g) in their mid-20s was similar to that of
normal-birth-weight controls (>2500g), there was uncertainty as to whether this positive
pattern would persist.
OBJECTIVE To compare the social functioning of low-birth-weight prematurely born adults
aged 29 to 36 years with that of normal-birth-weight term controls.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A population-based longitudinal cohort study was
conducted in Ontario, Canada, between March 14, 2011, and August 13, 2013, among 100 of
165 low-birth-weight survivors (60.6%) prematurely born between January 1, 1977, and
December 31, 1982, and 89 of 144 sociodemographically matched normal-birth-weight term
controls (61.8%) recruited at age 8 years. Neurologic impairments were present in 20
premature participants (20.0%).
EXPOSURES Extremely low birth weight.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Information on health, educational level, employment,
social integration, sexuality, and reproduction was obtained through standardized
questionnaires completed by the participants.
RESULTS Participants included 100 (39 males) extremely low-birth-weight survivors and 89
(33 males) normal-birth-weight term controls. The groups did not differ in the highest
educational level achieved or in family and partner relationships. However, a lower proportion
of premature adults was employed (odds ratio [OR], 0.37; 95% CI, 0.15 to 0.93) and fewer
were employed full time (OR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.24 to 0.98). The premature group had a mean
total personal income of $20 000 less than controls, and more required social assistance
(OR, 4.16; 95% CI, 1.13 to 15.33). Compared with the control group, more members of the
premature group remained single (OR, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.08 to 3.50), had never had sexual
intercourse (OR, 11.30; 95% CI, 2.56 to 49.91), did not have children (OR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.27
to 0.99), reported more chronic health conditions (β, 1.54; 95% CI, 0.79 to 2.30), had lower
self-esteem (β, 8.40; 95% CI, 1.68 to 15.12), and were less likely to have current drug abuse or
dependence (OR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.90 to 0.92) or lifetime alcohol abuse or dependence (OR,
0.30; 95% CI, 0.15 to 0.59). A higher proportion of premature adults without neurosensory
impairments identified themselves as nonheterosexual (OR, 4.87; 95% CI, 1.01 to 23.69).
After exclusion of individuals with neurosensory impairments, differences in employment,
social assistance, marital status, and reproduction were no longer significant.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In the fourth decade of life, extremely low-birth-weight
survivors achieved similar educational levels and family and partner relationships, and
reported fewer risky behaviors compared with controls. However, they had lower levels of
employment, income, and self-esteem, and fewer were married and had children. It is
therefore essential that these individuals receive necessary support and continued
monitoring throughout life.

hefirstgenerationofextremelylow-birth-weight(ELBW,
<1000 g) premature infants born after the introduc-
tion of neonatal intensive care has survived into the
fourthdecadeoflife.Severalinternationalstudiesontheyoung
adult outcomes of very premature infants have been pub-
lished in the last decade from Canada,1-5 the United States,6,7
England,8 Sweden,9 Norway,10 the Netherlands,11 Denmark,12
Finland,13 and Australia.14 These reports reveal that these
individuals have poorer educational6,8-11 and employment
outcomes,6,11 fewer leave the parental home,13 and more ex-
perience delays in the onset of sexual activity,6,8,11,13,15 mar-
riage or cohabitation,7,13,15 and reproduction.16-18 In addition,
a higher prevalence of chronic physical4,7,14 and mental health
issues5,19-22 have been noted, although risk-taking behaviors
appear to be less common.6,8,11
In previous assessments of this Canadian ELBW cohort
of young adults aged 22 to 26 years, no differences were
reported in educational attainment; employment; living
arrangements; marriage or cohabitation2; and peer, partner,
and family relationships23; as well as in self-reported quality
of life, compared with the normal-birth-weight (NBW,
>37 weeks and > 2500 g) control group.3 Consistent with
other studies, previously reported findings with this co-
hort showed that fewer ELBW individuals were sexually
active, and a lower proportion indulged in risk-taking
behaviors.6,8,11,13,23 These general findings pertained to all
participants, both with and without neurosensory impair-
ments (NSIs).
The question remains, though, whether as these ELBW
individuals mature, will they have employment opportuni-
ties, earn suitable wages, have fulfilling family and sexual re-
lationships,and/orintegratewellintosociety?Itisalsonotclear
if they will continue to have more chronic health problems that
might affect their adult functioning. This study explores these
issues,includingpossiblesexdifferencesandtheeffectofNSIs,
in the only prospective longitudinal cohort, to our knowl-
edge, of ELBW infants and NBW term controls followed into
their fourth decade of life.
Methods
Participants
Extremely low-birth-weight participants, weighing between
501 and 1000 g at birth, were recruited to a population-based
study of all individuals born from January 1, 1977, to Decem-
ber31,1982,incentral-westOntario,Canada.24Theyhavebeen
followeduplongitudinallysincebirth,andtheiroutcomeshave
been reported in multiple domains at ages 3, 5, and 8 years,25
at adolescence,26 and at young adulthood.2
The NBW term group was recruited at age 8 years from lo-
cal schools, and matched for sex, age, and social class.25 The
subsequent follow-up protocol for the NBW cohort was iden-
tical to that of the ELBW cohort. Both groups, now aged 29 to
36 years, were the primary respondents for all question-
naires, completed on a visit to McMaster Children’
s Hospital,
between March 14, 2011, and August 13, 2013. Ethics approval
was obtained from the Hamilton Health Sciences Research
EthicsBoard,andwritteninformedconsentwasobtainedfrom
all participants.
Measures and Sources of Data
Demographics
Information on educational level, employment, income, mari-
tal status, number of children, and current living arrangements
was obtained using standardized questionnaires, derived from
the Ontario Child Health Study.27
Relationships
Informationregardingcurrentinvolvementinromanticrelation-
shipswasobtainedthroughaself-administeredquestionnaire,28
complemented by additional questions from the Ontario Child
HealthStudy27regardingtherespondent’

Scale.29 Family functioning (specific to their current cohabit-
ingfamilymembers)wasmeasuredusingtheGeneralFunction-
ing subscale of the McMaster Family Assessment Device.30 In-
formationonsexualactivityandsexualorientationwasderived
from the Starfield Teen Health Profile.31 A Finnish study ques-
tionnaire on reproduction was modified, but not validated.32
Subjective Well-being
Social support was measured using the Young Adult Social
Support Index,33 which reflects 5 aspects of social support:
emotional, esteem, network, appraisal, and altruism. Partici-
pants rated their loneliness on the Revised UCLA Loneliness
Scale34 and rated their self-esteem using the Coopersmith Self-
Esteem Inventory.35
Risk-Taking Behaviors
Informationoncurrentandlifetimealcoholandsubstancemis-
use was obtained via the Mini International Neuropsychiatric
Interview, a structured psychiatric interview conducted by
trained interviewers who were naive to participant group
status.22,36 Participants also answered questions from the
Young Adult Self-Report questionnaire37 about contact with
police and whether they had ever been convicted of a crime.
Key Points
Question What are the differences in outcomes during the fourth
decade of life between extremely low-birth-weight infants
(<1000 g) and normal-birth-weight term controls?
Findings In this population-based, longitudinal cohort study,
compared with the control group, fewer extremely
low-birth-weight adults were employed in the last year, their
personal total income was $20 000 lower, and they were more
likely to remain single. There were no differences in educational
level, partner relationships, current drug abuse and dependence,
and lifetime alcohol abuse and dependence.
Meaning Overall, most members of the extremely
low-birth-weight cohort were living independently and
contributing to society in their fourth decade of life.

Health
The presence or absence of 24 chronic health conditions, in-
cluding hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes
mellitus,wasself-reportedusingtheOntarioChildHealthStudy
scales,27 and the counts were summed.
Statistical Analysis
Simple comparisons between ELBW and NBW participants on
variables were measured categorically and dimensionally. For
categorical measures, we used χ2 tests of statistical signifi-
cance and computed 95% CIs around percent differences. For
dimensional measures, we used analyses of variance and the
unstandardized β and 95% CIs of the pairwise comparisons.
All statistical analyses were performed with IBM SPSS Statis-
tics, version 22 (IBM Corp). Possible sex differences were also
explored for all outcomes. Analyses were also performed af-
ter removing participants with an NSI, to determine if the find-
ings remained significant for subjects without NSIs.
Results
Participant Characteristics
ELBW Cohort
A total of 179 of 397 (45.1%) ELBW infants survived to hospi-
tal discharge; 13 children died after discharge. One ELBW child
with NSI subsequently died in young adulthood. At age 29 to
36 years, 100 of 165 eligible survivors (60.6%) were assessed
(Table 1). Mean (SD) birth weight for the ELBW cohort was
834.90(132.74)gandmean(SD)gestationalagewas27.13(2.42)
weeks;25participants(25.0%)werebornatlessthan26weeks’
gestationand29(29.0%)weresmallforgestationalage.38Neu-
rosensory impairments were present in 20 of the participants
(20.0%).
Within the ELBW cohort, those who participated at age 29
to 36 years were more likely to be female (odds ratio [OR], 2.44;
95% CI, 1.23-4.83) and have a higher parental socioeconomic
status at the 8-year visit (M difference, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.22-
0.81) than those lost to attrition. However, they did not differ
by birth weight or gestational age.
NBW Cohort
At age 29 to 36 years, 89 of 144 of those recruited at age 8 years
(61.8%) were assessed. Of these, 1 woman with NSIs subse-
quently died. The NBW participants were also more likely to
be female (OR, 2.44; 95% CI, 1.23-4.83). At the current visit,
the 2 groups did not differ by participant sex or age.
Participant Attrition
Of the 282 potential ELBW and NBW participants from young
adulthood, we were unable to contact 73 individuals (ELBW,
38; NBW, 35), 13 declined participation (ELBW, 5; NBW, 8), 2
weredeceased(ELBW,1;NBW,1),and5ELBWparticipantswere
unable to be tested owing to severe neurologic and/or cogni-
tive deficits (eFigure in the Supplement). Among the nonpar-
ticipants, 20 ELBW individuals and 2 NBW individuals had
NSIs.
Education, Employment, Income, and Housing
There were no differences in the total number of years or in
the highest educational level completed to date (Table 2). In
comparison with the NBW group, the ELBW group had signifi-
cantly lower rates of any employment in the last year (78 of
97 [80.4%] vs 78 of 85 [91.8%]) and fewer were employed full
time(48of78[61.5%]vs59of77[76.6%]);womenintheELBW
cohort were less likely to work full time than were women in
the NBW cohort (OR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.18-0.99) There were
marked differences between the groups in personal annual in-
come and total household income, with those in the ELBW co-
hortearningameanof$20 000(Canadiandollars)lessperyear
than those in the NBW cohort. In addition, a higher propor-
tion of ELBW survivors were receiving social assistance (12 of
87 [13.8%] vs 3 of 81 [3.7%]), which was significant only for
ELBW men vs NBW men (OR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.02-1.39). Never-
theless, similar to the NBW group, more than one-third of the
ELBW cohort owned their own home, while 8 of 96 individu-
als in the ELBW cohort (8.3%) and 2 of 84 individuals in the
NBW cohort (2.4%) were in subsidized housing. The propor-
tion of those in the ELBW cohort vs those in the NBW cohort
with special living arrangements (7 of 98 [7.1%] vs 1 [1.1%]) did
not reach statistical significance.
Dating, Marriage, Sexuality, and Reproduction
Overall, a significantly higher proportion of the ELBW cohort
who were not married or cohabiting were either not dating or
were rarely dating compared with the NBW cohort (30 of 96
[31.3%] vs 11 of 84 [13.1%]) (Table 3). While there were no dif-
ferences among men, ELBW women were significantly more
likely than NBW women to not be dating (OR, 3.44; 95% CI,
1.25-9.48). Also, there were significant differences in marital
status: a higher proportion of the ELBW cohort was single or
never married vs the NBW cohort (51 [51.0%] vs 31 [34.8%]).

In terms of their sexual orientation, although a higher pro-
portion of the ELBW cohort identified themselves as nonhet-
erosexual (9 of 96 [9.4%] vs 2 of 86 [2.3%]), statistical signifi-
cance was achieved only when participants with NSIs were
excluded (Table 3). Of the 9 nonheterosexual ELBW partici-
pants, 6 identified as bisexual (5 women and 1 man), 1 as les-
bian, and 2 as questioning their sexual orientation (1 man and
1 woman). Two women in the NBW cohort (2.2%) identified
themselves as nonheterosexual (1 as bisexual and 1 as ques-
tioning her sexual orientation).
Significantly more ELBW survivors had never experi-
enced sexual intercourse compared with the NBW cohort (20
of 97 [20.6%] vs 2 [2.2%]) (Table 3). Men in the ELBW cohort
were 9.93-fold (95% CI, 1.19-82.25) more likely to have never
experienced sexual intercourse than were men in the NBW co-
hort (9 of 38 [23.7%] vs 1 of 33 [3.0%]), while women in the
ELBW cohort were 12.60-fold (95% CI, 1.57-101.23) more likely
than women in the NBW cohort (11 of 59 [18.6%] vs 1 of 56
[1.8%]). The mean (SD) age at first sexual intercourse was also
higher for those in the ELBW cohort than those in the NBW co-

hort (19.7 [4.0] vs 18.4 [3.3] years); there were no differences
between sexes for this outcome.
A significantly lower proportion of the ELBW cohort had
children vs the NBW cohort (20 [20.0%] vs 29 [32.6%])
(Table 3). Women in the ELBW cohort were less likely than
women in the NBW cohort to have children (OR, 0.44; 95% CI,
0.20-0.96), whereas there were no differences between the
groups among men. The mean number of children did not dif-
fer between the groups.
Reproductive Problems
There were no differences in the proportion of participants
in the ELBW and NBW cohorts with self-reported fertility
problems (eTable in the Supplement). Women in the ELBW
cohort did not have a higher incidence than those in the
NBW cohort of menstrual irregularities or endometriosis.
Significantly fewer women in the ELBW cohort had ever
been pregnant. Among the women in the ELBW cohort who
had been pregnant (23 of 60 [38.3%] vs 32 of 52 [61.5%]),
there were no differences in the rates of miscarriages (8 of
23 [34.8%] vs 6 of 32 [18.8%]) or births at less than 37
weeks’gestation (4 of 23 [17.4%] vs 3 of 32 [9.4%]) com-
pared with women in the NBW cohort.
Social Integration and Risk-Taking Behaviors
There were no differences between the groups in relation-
ship functioning with their partners, family functioning, lone-
liness, or social support (Table 4). However, the ELBW group
had significantly poorer self-esteem, which did not differ
by sex.
Although there were no differences in current alcohol
abuseordependencebetweentheELBWandNBWgroups,life-
time alcohol abuse or dependence was significantly lower
among both ELBW men and women, both with and without
NSIs.Lifetimealcoholabuseordependencewas0.24-fold(95%
CI, 0.08-0.70) less likely among men in the ELBW cohort than
men in the NBW cohort, and 0.30-fold (95% CI, 0.11-0.81) less
likely among women in the ELBW cohort than women in the
NBW cohort.
Current drug abuse or dependence was significantly lower
among the ELBW than NBW participants. Men in the ELBW co-
hortreportedlowerlevelsofabuseordependencethandidmen
in the NBW cohort (OR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.04-0.97), while there
werenodifferencesbetweenthewomenintheELBWandNBW
cohorts. There were no differences in lifetime substance abuse
or dependence. Rates of contact with the police and being
convicted of a crime or incarcerated were similar between the
cohorts.
Chronic Health Conditions and Medication Use
Participants in the ELBW cohort self-reported significantly
more chronic health conditions than did those in the NBW
cohort (mean [SD], 3.29 [3.1] vs 1.71 [1.8]) (Table 5). Visual
problems were significantly more common in the ELBW

cohort had a higher prevalence of coordination problems vs
those in the NBW cohort (16 of 99 [16.2%] vs 1 [1.1%]), which
was higher in women in the ELBW cohort than women in
the NBW cohort (OR, 10.78; 95% CI, 1.33-87.25). Those in the
ELBW cohort had a higher rate of medication use on a regu-
lar basis than those in the NBW cohort (55 of 99 [55.6%] vs
32 of 88 [36.4%]), which was higher among women in the
ELBW cohort than women in the NBW cohort (OR, 2.23;
95% CI, 1.05-4.77). Overall, the rate of long-term health con-
ditions was significantly higher among the ELBW cohort
than the NBW cohort (24 of 98 [24.5%] vs 11 of 88 [12.5%]),
but there were no reported limitations in daily activities due
to these conditions.
Exclusion of Individuals With NSIs
After excluding individuals with NSIs, there were no signifi-
cant differences in rates of any employment, rates of full-
timeemployment,receiptofsocialassistance,datingandmari-
tal status, mean age at first sexual intercourse, proportion who
had children, and current drug abuse or dependence. How-
ever, statistically significant associations remained in per-
sonal and total household income, lower self-esteem, ever ex-
periencing sexual intercourse, lifetime alcohol abuse or
dependence, learning disability, mental illness, problems
with coordination, visual impairment, sinusitis, medication
use, wearing glasses or contact lenses, and chronic health
conditions.
Discussion
This is the first comprehensive report, to our knowledge, of
the health and social status of a longitudinally followed
cohort of ELBW adults into the fourth decade of life. The ELBW
group showed no differences in family and partner relation-
ships vs the NBW cohort and continued to have a lower rate
of risk-taking behaviors than did the NBW group. Although
the groups did not differ in their educational levels, the
ELBW cohort had lower rates of employment and personal in-
come,andahigherproportionreceivedsocialassistance.Fewer
participants in the ELBW group were dating, married, or
cohabiting, and a significant proportion had never experi-

enced sexual intercourse. Although they did not report more
reproductive problems, fewer participants in the ELBW co-
hort had children. In addition, chronic health problems and
medicationuseweremorefrequentamongthemembersofthe
ELBW cohort. Unlike the data reported in some studies,8,13 the
data in our study are based on all participants, including those
with NSIs.
The trajectory exhibited in our longitudinal study ap-
pears to be that during early childhood the ELBW group pre-
sented with delayed milestones and 46 of 166 individuals
(27.7%) had NSIs.24 As they grew older, they faced further chal-
lenges with learning and behavioral issues that persisted into
adolescence.25,26,39 However, they did show relative improve-
ments in their health status40 and reported similar levels of
self-esteem41 and quality of life compared with their peers.42
In their early 20s, contrary to our hypothesis, the members of
the ELBW cohort did remarkably well in most variables of suc-
cessful transition.2 Based on this finding, the future of these
former children should be considered from a lifespan
perspective.43
What is the explanation of this downward trend seen at
the current assessment? First, it may be that in the last
report at young adulthood, the participants had just started
this transition, and therefore the differences were less
apparent.2 Second, many social and economic factors may
have contributed to this delayed transition. Despite pursu-
ing a higher education, today’
s young adults face a labor
market in which fewer are employed full time and jobs are
scarce. Consequently, they may live in the parental home
for a longer time and postpone marriage and parenthood.
Obviously, these factors also apply to the NBW group. How-
ever, the high proportion among the ELBW cohort with NSIs
accounted for many differences between the groups. After
exclusion of those with NSI, only differences in employ-
ment, income, lower rates of sexual intercourse, self-
esteem, and lifetime alcohol abuse or dependence remained
significant.
An unexpected finding was that, after exclusion of
those with an NSI, a higher proportion of the ELBW cohort
self-identified as bisexual or homosexual compared with
the NBW group. By and large, there was consistency in the
reported sexual orientation at young adulthood (ELBW, 12 of
141 [8.5%] vs NBW, 3 of 133 [2.3%]; P = .23)23 and at the cur-
rent age, except for 1 member of the ELBW cohort and 1
member of the NBW cohort who changed their status
between the 2 follow-up periods. However, it is unclear why
there is a preponderance of nonheterosexual women in
both follow-up periods and in both groups. To our knowl-
edge, there is no such information available from other pre-
mature cohorts.
The first 2003 Canadian Community Health Survey on
sexual orientation of more than 135 000 individuals aged 18
to 59 years revealed that 1.0% considered themselves to be
homosexual and 0.7% considered themselves to be
bisexual.44 The homosexuality rate of 1.3% among men was
about twice that of women (0.7%). However, a slightly
higher proportion of women than men identified as bisexual
(0.9% vs 0.6%). The corresponding figures from a 2013 US
National Survey reported that 1.6% of adults identified as
gay or lesbian and 0.7% as bisexual.45 Similar to this study,
these surveys also relied on self-report. We recognize that
survey respondents may not feel comfortable disclosing
their sexual orientation for fear of stigma and discrimina-
tion. Nevertheless, we have a comparison NBW group that
was surveyed at the same time, using the same methods.
The incidence of nonheterosexuals is much higher in our
ELBW cohort relative to both our NBW group and the Cana-
dian and US population-based data. Pooled data from other
premature cohorts, when available, would help confirm
whether this is a true association, or whether it is within the
range of measurement error.
The rate of chronic health conditions, particularly visual
impairments, was higher in the ELBW cohort than the
NBW cohort. This finding may be a reflection of the lack
of treatment in the era before cryotherapy; participants in
the ELBW cohort also had a high prevalence of retinal
detachment. Women in both groups reported more health
problems than did men. Although our preterm adults had
lower pregnancy rates, we did not observe an increase in
infertility, miscarriages, or premature births.16-18 However,
we recognize that our sample size is rather small for such
analyses.
Overall, the majority of extremely premature adults are
living independently and contributing well to society.
Women in the ELBW cohort are more compromised than
men in employment, dating, marriage, and chronic health
conditions.
This 4-decade longitudinal follow-up study of former
ELBW infants is not without limitations. In our previous re-
ports, compliance was very high, but new family and employ-
ment pressures may have contributed to the lower rates at this
visit. The sample size is thus smaller and may have contrib-
uted to the large variance in some findings. A higher propor-
tion of women than men participated, and the parental socio-
economic status at age 8 years was also higher. Nevertheless,
the groups were balanced on most key variables, and the fol-
low-up rate of over 60% into their 30s is still acceptable rela-
tive to other studies.8,13,18,46

these individuals receive necessary support and continued

doubled, and so in absolute numbers, there are significantly
more survivors. Such studies, and others on newer cohorts in
the post-surfactant era, should be conducted throughout the
life course of these individuals to obtain a better understand-
ing of the most pressing issues, and to develop effective in-
tervention strategies.
