A
trial fibrillation (AF) has an estimated prevalence of 2% to 
3% in the adult population.1,2 It is associated with increased 
morbidity and mortality, mainly as a result of an increased risk of 
stroke and comorbidities such as hypertension, coronary artery 
disease, obesity, diabetes mellitus, and heart failure. Exercise 
training has been documented as effective in preventing and treat-
ing most of these diseases.3–6 According to international guide-
lines, many patients with AF should therefore be recommended 
to increase their level of physical activity because of their comor-
bidities.7,8 However, the effect that physical activity has on the 
burden of AF is unclear, and there are no specific recommenda-
tions for exercise in the AF guidelines.9,10 Recent studies have 
suggested that high levels of physical exercise training increase 
the risk of AF11–14 but have not led to reservations about exercise 
for AF patients in the guidelines for the prevention and treatment 
of cardiovascular disease.7,8 Other studies indicate a lower inci-
dence of AF in individuals performing more moderate levels of 
exercise.13,15,16 Because of these conflicting findings, many AF 
patients and their physicians have been uncertain about the ben-
efits and potential negative effects of exercise training and have 
therefore been reluctant to partake in endurance exercise, particu-
larly at higher intensities. The purpose of the present study was to 
evaluate the effect of 12 weeks of aerobic interval training (AIT) 
on time in AF, AF symptoms, cardiac function, exercise capacity, 
quality of life (QoL), lipid profile, and the need for healthcare 
services in patients with paroxysmal or persistent AF.
Methods
Study Sample
We recruited 51 patients with symptomatic, ECG-documented, nonper-
manent AF who were referred for first AF ablation or to the outpatient 
Background—Exercise training is an effective treatment for important atrial fibrillation (AF) comorbidities. However, a 
high level of endurance exercise is associated with an increased AF prevalence. We assessed the effects of aerobic interval 
training (AIT) on time in AF, AF symptoms, cardiovascular health, and quality of life in AF patients.
Methods and Results—Fifty-one patients with nonpermanent AF were randomized to AIT (n=26) consisting of four 
4-minute intervals at 85% to 95% of peak heart rate 3 times a week for 12 weeks or to a control group (n=25) continuing 
their regular exercise habits. An implanted loop recorder measured time in AF continuously from 4 weeks before to 4 
weeks after the intervention period. Cardiac function, peak oxygen uptake (V
⋅o2peak), lipid status, quality of life, and AF 
symptoms were evaluated before and after the 12-week intervention period. Mean time in AF increased from 10.4% to 
14.6% in the control group and was reduced from 8.1% to 4.8% in the exercise group (P=0.001 between groups). AF 
symptom frequency (P=0.006) and AF symptom severity (P=0.009) were reduced after AIT. AIT improved V
⋅o2peak, left 
atrial and ventricular ejection fraction, quality-of-life measures of general health and vitality, and lipid values compared 
with the control group. There was a trend toward fewer cardioversions and hospital admissions after AIT.
Conclusions—AIT for 12 weeks reduces the time in AF in patients with nonpermanent AF. This is followed by a significant 
improvement in AF symptoms, V
⋅o2peak, left atrial and ventricular function, lipid levels, and QoL.

clinic at the Department of Cardiology, St. Olavs Hospital, Trondheim, 
Norway. Nonpermanent AF was paroxysmal (ie, self-terminating within 
7 days) or persistent (ie, lasting >7 days or requiring cardioversion).10 
Exclusion criteria were the following: performing endurance training 
at high intensity >2 times a week or at moderate intensity for >3 times 
a week, previous open heart surgery, left ventricular ejection fraction 
<45%, significant cardiac valve disease, implanted cardiac pacemaker, 
coronary artery disease without complete revascularization, or inability 
to accomplish the exercise program. Of the 313 individuals screened for 
inclusion, 125 patients met the inclusion criteria. Forty-two met 1 of the 
exclusion criteria (Figure I in the online-only Data Supplement). Of the 
83 patients invited, 53 accepted the invitation. Two patients withdrew 
from the study before randomization because of highly symptomatic AF 
that required ablation within the study period of 5 months.
Study Design
This study is a single-center, single-blind, randomized, controlled 
trial. After inclusion, a loop recorder was implanted to continuously 
record time in AF. Baseline data were collected during the first 4 
weeks. After the initial data collection, patients were randomized 
either to AIT (n=26) for 12 weeks or to a control group (n=25) that 
continued their previous exercise habits. Patients were stratified for 
paroxysmal or persistent AF to obtain an equal burden of AF between 
groups. After the intervention, there was a 4-week follow-up period 
with examinations and data collection. Numbers of hospital admis-
sions, cardioversions, and changes in medication were recorded dur-
ing the whole 20-week period. The investigators performing the data 
analyses were blinded for intervention identity, and none of the study 
investigators were involved in treatment of the patients. The study 
was performed according to the Helsinki Declaration, approved by 
the regional medical ethics research committee (No. 2010/3345-1), 
and registered in Clinicaltrials.gov (identifier: NCT01325675) before 
inclusion. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients.
Exercise
Endurance training was performed as walking or running on a tread-
mill 3 times a week for 12 weeks. Each session started with a 10-min-
ute warmup at 60% to 70% of maximal heart rate obtained at exercise 
testing (HRpeak), followed by four 4-minute intervals at 85% to 95% 
of HRpeak with 3 minutes of active recovery at 60% to 70% of HRpeak 
between intervals, ending with a 5-minute cooldown period. During 
AF, patients exercised at the same treadmill speed and inclination as 
in the previous sessions in sinus rhythm, with the Borg scale of 6 to 
20 as an aid to control intensity. When familiar with the training regi-
men, patients were allowed to perform 1 exercise per week at home, 
where exercise intensity was documented with a heart rate monitor 
(RS300X, Polar Electro, Kempele, Finland).
Study Outcomes
The primary outcome was predefined as change in time in AF from 
baseline to follow-up. Secondary outcomes were AF symptoms, 
exercise capacity measured as peak oxygen uptake (V
⋅o2peak), car-
diac volumes, QoL, lipid status, level of physical activity, and number 
of cardioversions and hospital admissions resulting from AF.
Time in AF
A loop recorder (Reveal XT, Medtronic Inc, Minneapolis, MN) was 
implanted in a left parasternal position.17 The AF-detecting algorithm 
calculates variability of intervals between consecutive ventricular 
depolarizations in 2-minute periods and classifies each period as 
sinus rhythm or AF on the basis of regularity. The overall accuracy of 
this unit for detecting AF was 98.5% in a validation study.18 The loop 
recorder was programmed to record only AF and no regular tachycar-
dia. AF episode–detection parameters were kept in the default setting. 
Raw data files were used for analysis, showing minutes of AF each 
day. Two-minute strips of ECGs were recorded for the last 10 AF 
episodes between each interrogation, and all were manually reviewed 
to verify AF. A 48-hour ambulatory, continuous ECG recording 
(DigiTrak XT, Phillips Healthcare, Andover, MA) was performed 3 
times for each patient to ensure validity of the data from the loop 
recorder. Time in AF is the percentage of the time in each 4-week 
period with verified AF that was recorded by the loop recorder.
AF Symptoms and QoL
Participants completed the Norwegian version of the Short-Form 3619 
and the AF Symptoms and Severity Checklist20 previously used in 
AF patients.21
Magnetic Resonance Imaging
A Siemens Avanto 1.5-T system with a body matrix coil (Siemens, 
Erlangen, Germany) was used for magnetic resonance imaging. 
Images were analyzed with Segment version 1.9.22 Left atrial and 
ventricular volumes were measured by outlining the endocardial wall 
in a stack of short-axis images (6-mm slice thickness, no gap). The 
basal extent of the left ventricle was decided manually by orientation 
in multiple planes during the cardiac cycle, with long-axis images 
used in addition to the short-axis images. Volumes were then deter-
mined by the Simpson rule. Papillary muscles were included in the 
ventricular volumes. The left atrial appendix and pulmonary veins 
were excluded from atrial volumes. Magnetic resonance imaging 
examinations performed during AF were excluded from analyses.
Exercise Testing
An individualized treadmill V
⋅o2peak test was performed with the 
Jaeger Oxycon Pro (CareFusion, San Diego, CA) or MetaMaxII 
(Cortex, Leipzig, Germany).23 All subjects were tested in sinus 
rhythm with the same equipment at baseline and follow-up.
Biochemistry
Blood samples were analyzed by standard procedures at St. Olavs 
Hospital. Low-density lipoprotein values were estimated with the 
Friedewald equation.
Activity Monitoring
Daily activity and energy expenditure were measured with a 
SenseWear Pro 3 Armband (BodyMedia, Inc, Pittsburgh, PA).24 
Participants wore the armband for at least 4 consecutive days during 
both the 4-week baseline period and the last 2 weeks of the interven-
tion period.
Statistics
By including 50 patients, the study was estimated to have sufficient 
power (0.84) to detect a 30% reduction from a mean time of 34±12% 
in AF.25 Change from baseline to follow-up within each group was 
analyzed with the paired-samples t test for normally distributed data 
and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for nonnormally distributed data. 
Changes from baseline to follow-up between groups were analyzed 
by the independent-samples t test for normally distributed data and 
the Mann-Whitney U test for nonnormally distributed data. Two-
sided values of P<0.05 were considered to indicate statistical sig-
nificance. Analyses comparing the 2 groups adjusted for age, systolic 
blood pressure, and weight at baseline were performed with logistic 
regression. Investigators analyzing the data were blinded to the inter-
vention group. Data for the primary end point were not normally dis-
tributed, and the median time in AF was not properly descriptive for 
the results. The means, however, were considered the best descriptive 
parameter and are included with standard deviations or confidence 
intervals (CIs), but the numbers should be interpreted with the reser-
vations mentioned above in mind. When patients without AF during 
the study were excluded, the data were normally distributed in each 
4-week period. Data for change from baseline to follow-up for all 
study patients were also normally distributed. Differences were ana-
lyzed with the Mann-Whitney U test as a precaution.
Results
Study Patients and AF Detection
From March 2011 to April 2013, 51 patients with symptom-
atic, nonpermanent AF were included. Of these, 41 were 
referred for AF ablation. All patients completed the 20-week

study period. Baseline data were similar between groups, 
except patients in the exercise group were younger (Table 1). 
All patients performed exercise as described in the protocol 
and achieved the target heart rate, but as a result of intercurrent 
infections and musculoskeletal symptoms, 6 patients com-
pleted <80% (56%–78%) of the planned number of exercises. 
There were no significant differences in use of antiarrhythmic 
drugs (Table 2) or changes in such treatment between groups. 
Three patients in the control group changed their medications 
during the study period. One patient changed from bisopro-
lol to sotalol because of symptomatic AF; 1 patient changed 
from flecainide to sotalol as a result of intolerable skin rash; 
and 1 patient discontinued flecainide owing to self-terminat-
ing ventricular tachycardia at follow-up testing. One patient 
in the exercise group reduced the dose of metoprolol depot 
because of symptomatic hypotension. There were no major 
adverse events in the exercise group, but 2 patients had self-
limiting episodes of bursitis that required participants to sub-
stitute stationary bicycle exercise for treadmill exercise for a 
short period of time. In the control group, 1 patient suffered a 
stroke during the intervention period, and 1 patient had a self-
terminating ventricular tachycardia during follow-up exercise 
testing.
All AF episodes of >2 minutes with a simultaneous loop 
recorder and ambulatory ECG recording were correctly 
detected by the loop recorder. In 18 patients, AF episodes reg-
istered by the loop recorders were reclassified after manual 
analyses. In these patients, 0.02% to 2.7% of the study time 
was misclassified as AF owing to sinus arrhythmia, ectopic 
beats, or noise in the ECG recordings during activity. The 
loop recorder was not programmed to detect atrial flutter with 
regular ventricular activity, but episodes with atrial flutter and 
irregular ventricular activity were included in the analyses. 
This represented <1% of the total AF time.
Primary End Point: Time in AF
Sixteen patients in the control group and 3 patients in the exer-
cise group had increased time in AF, whereas 5 patients in 
the control group and 10 patients in the exercise group had a 
decreased time in AF (Figure 1). Mean time in AF increased 
from 10.4% (95% CI, 4.6–17.8) to 14.6% (95% CI, 6.4–24.9) 
in the control group and was reduced from 8.1% (95% CI, 
4.1–12.8) to 4.8% (95% CI, 2.0–7.6) in the exercise group 
(Table 2), with a mean difference in change between groups 
of 7.6 percentage points (95% CI, 2.1–13.0) (P=0.001). 
Because there was a significant difference between groups 
for age and a trend toward lower systolic blood pressure and 
weight in the exercise group at baseline, analyses adjusting 
for those differences were performed. For change in time in 
AF, the estimated difference between groups increased to 
8.4 percentage points (P=0.031; Table I in the online-only 
Data Supplement). Fifteen patients had no AF during the 
study period. When these patients were excluded from analy-
ses, there was a decrease in time in AF in the exercise group 
from 15.0% (95% CI, 8.4–21.6) to 8.8% (95% CI, 4.4–13.3; 
P=0.02) and an increase from 11.8% (95% CI, 4.2–19.4) to 
16.6% (95% CI, 5.9–27.3) in the control group (P=0.09) with 
a significant difference between groups (P=0.007; Figure 2). 
Of the patients without AF during the study period, 47% were 
using amiodarone compared with 6% in the group with AF 
during the study period (P=0.001). Twenty-two of the patients 
(43%) had persistent AF, but only 2 of them had AF episodes 
lasting >7 days during the study period.
AF Symptoms and QoL
Patients in the exercise group improved their Short-Form 36 
scores on general health and vitality from baseline to follow-
up compared with control subjects (Table 3). They also had 
an improvement in summary measures of both physical and 
mental health, but this was not significant compared with the 
control subjects. In the exercise group, there was a reduction 
in AF symptom frequency and severity as measured by the 
AF Symptoms and Severity Checklist compared with control 
subjects.
Exercise Testing and Resting Heart Rate
After 12 weeks of exercise training, subjects in the exercise 
group had a significant increase in V
⋅o2peak compared with 
control subjects (Table 2). Patients in the exercise group had 
a significant reduction in resting heart rate, but this was not 
statistically significant compared with control subjects.

Cardiac Imaging
There were no changes in left atrial or left ventricular end-dia-
stolic volumes with exercise (Table 2). Patients in the exercise 
group had a significant increase in total and active left atrial 
emptying fraction compared with control subjects. Left ven-
tricular ejection fraction was improved compared with control 
subjects.
Lipid Status and Body Mass Index
Patients in the exercise group had decreases in total choles-
terol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride 
levels compared with control subjects, and there was a signifi-
cant decrease in weight and body mass index compared with 
control subjects (Table 2).
Activity Monitoring
Patients in the exercise group increased their daily energy 
expenditure as measured by calories per day, time in activity 
higher than 3 metabolic equivalents (METs), and steps per day, 
whereas there was no change in activity level from baseline to 
follow-up in the control group (Table 2). Time in activity >6 
METs was the only parameter that was significantly increased 
compared with control subjects, but this was not significant 
when adjusted for age, systolic blood pressure, and weight at 
baseline (Table I in the online-only Data Supplement).
Cardioversions and Hospital Admissions
There was a trend toward fewer cardioversions (1 versus 6; 
P=0.14) and hospital admissions (1 versus 9; P=0.07) in the 
exercise group.
Discussion
AIT for 12 weeks reduced the time in AF in patients with par-
oxysmal or persistent AF. It was associated with significant 
improvements in AF symptoms, exercise capacity, left atrial 
and ventricular function, lipid levels, and QoL.
The effect of exercise on AF is a matter of both mecha-
nistic and clinical relevance. The present study confirms

that physical activity can reduce the time in AF. This has not 
previously been shown in a randomized study. The findings 
are strengthened by the gradual decrease in AF burden in 
the exercise group and the persistent effect 4 weeks after the 
intervention period. Most patients (82%) were referred for AF 
ablation. This indicates highly symptomatic patients with a 
need for intervention beyond medical treatment. The reduc-
tion of time in AF and AF symptoms and the improved QoL in 
this group of patients imply an important clinical benefit and 
suggest that exercise training can also be a valuable tool in an 
increasingly symptomatic phase of the disease. A trend toward 
fewer cardioversions and hospital admissions in the exercise 
group is in line with the main findings.
AIT is an effective and individually controllable exercise 
modality that allows exercise at higher intensities, inducing 
larger biological effects than continuous exercise.5,6 AIT was 
therefore chosen as the exercise intervention, although con-
tinuous exercise at moderate intensity is more commonly 
used. With relevant exclusion criteria and initial testing, AIT 
has been shown to be safe in clinical settings,26 and no major 
adverse outcomes were seen in this study. The time spent at 
higher intensities, which is also defined as vigorous exercise,27 
was short, and the total amount of exercise performed was 
moderate and in line with current guidelines on primary and 
secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases.3,7,8
Our results showed that moderate amounts of exercise are 
beneficial for patients with AF; these results support the grow-
ing evidence of an exercise-induced protective effect on AF 
risk in healthy individuals. Light to moderate amounts of exer-
cise seem to reduce AF risk,13,15,16 and better cardiorespiratory 
fitness is shown to have a graded, inverse relationship to AF 
risk up to a certain point.28,29 Our study results extend these 
previous findings by also showing a reduced burden of AF in 
individuals with manifest disease. This concept of AF treat-
ment has not previously been reported, but other studies have 
shown that modification of risk factors reduces AF burden,30,31 
risk of new-onset AF,32 and recurrence after ablation33,34 and 
cardioversion.32 Exercise is known to be effective in modu-
lating cardiovascular risk factors, and the results support the 
concept that lifestyle changes and modification of risk factors 
should be a central part in the management of AF.
The present results differ from the findings of several 
studies that suggest an increased incidence of AF with physi-
cal activity. In these epidemiological studies, the increased 
risk was found with exercise training only at high levels 
over a long period of time.11,35 Two larger studies showed an 
increased risk of AF in men who had exercised at least 5 d/
wk from a young age.16,35 In a study on cross-country skiers, 
increased risk was seen only in the athletes with the best rac-
ing times and longest periods of endurance training.14 With the 
limitation of the different study populations kept in mind, it 
seems that the increased risk of AF in these studies is associ-
ated with exercise levels far above that applied in the present 
study. The patients included in our study are more comparable 
to the general AF population and probably have a different 
mechanism of AF disease than highly trained athletes.36–38 The 
long-term effects of AIT are uncertain. Self-reported endur-
ance exercise for at least 30 minutes 3 times per week, which 
is comparable to the amount of exercise in our study, did not 
increase AF risk over a time span of <20 years or in individu-
als >50 years of age.39 Therefore, our data support that the 
recommendations of at least 30 to 40 minutes of moderate to 
vigorous exercise for at least 3 to 4 d/wk are also applicable 
for patients with AF.3,7,8
Improvements in QoL and AF symptoms have also been 
shown after exercise in patients with permanent AF.40,41 These 
findings are important because many AF patients are highly 
symptomatic.42,43 Because pulmonary vein ablation, cardio-
versions, and medical treatment are largely symptomatic treat-
ments without documented effect on mortality, exercise might 
be an important supplement and, in some cases, an alternative 
to medication and invasive procedures with lower risks of side 
effects and complications.
Patients in the exercise group improved their exer-
cise capacity and left atrial and ventricular function. The

end-diastolic cardiac volumes did not increase in the exercise 
group, although this is a well-known adaption to exercise.44,45 
A possible explanation might be that many of the patients had 
enlarged cardiac volumes at inclusion. In this setting, exercise 
might reduce the cardiac volumes toward normal, as shown in 
patients with heart failure.5
Improved exercise capacity by endurance exercise has 
been shown in patients with permanent AF but has not been 
studied in patients with nonpermanent AF.41,46 The increase in 
this study was lower than expected from comparable studies 
in patients with metabolic syndrome, heart failure, and coro-
nary artery disease.5,6,23 Use of antiarrhythmic and heart rate–
reducing drugs might be a contributing factor because they 
reduce the maximal heart rate and might reduce the response 
to exercise. However, a larger relative increase in V
⋅o2peak was 
seen in heart failure patients with even lower peak heart rate.5 
An alternative explanation may be that recurrent episodes of 
AF reduce the cardiac response to exercise.
Study Limitations
The single-center design and the relatively small number of 
participants are limitations of the present study. Compared 
with the general AF population, the patients in this study are 
rather healthy with few comorbidities; therefore, generaliza-
tion of these findings to AF populations with more severe 
cardiovascular disease should be done cautiously. However, 
similar findings have been seen in AF patients with obesity and 
other cardiovascular risk factors, implying that our findings 
might also be valid in other populations. This should encour-
age larger multicenter studies. The improvement in cardiac 
and metabolic parameters indicates that aerobic interval exer-
cise has the same favorable effect on risk factors in patients 
with AF as in patients with other cardiovascular diseases.3,4,8
The patients were not blinded for the exercise interven-
tion. This might have affected the self-reported end points and 
the patients’ everyday lifestyle (eg, general activity and diet), 
but it would not have affected the primary end point directly.
Although no major adverse events were registered, the 
study is too small to establish the safety of exercise training 
in AF patients. However, the safety of exercise training is well 
documented in patients with established coronary artery dis-
ease and a high incidence of AF.8,26 The ideal dose of exercise 
training in AF patients in terms of intensity and duration is 
still not known. Most important, the long-term effect of AIT 
in AF needs to be investigated further.
Conclusions
AIT for 12 weeks reduces the arrhythmic burden in AF 
patients. It is associated with significant improvements in AF 
symptoms, exercise capacity, left atrial and ventricular func-
tion, lipid levels, and QoL. Further studies are needed to find 
the optimal intensity and amount of exercise training over a 
longer period of time and to explore the mechanisms of exer-
cise-induced effects in AF. These findings support the concept 
that interventions aimed at lifestyle and risk factors should be 
central in the management of patients with AF.

CLINICAL PERSPECTIvE
Exercise training is an effective treatment for important atrial fibrillation (AF) comorbidities, and risk factor interventions 
have recently been shown to reduce AF burden. On the other hand, high levels of endurance exercise have been associated 
with an increased prevalence of AF. The effects of exercise training on arrhythmic burden in AF patients are uncertain, 
and there are currently no specific recommendations for exercise training in AF patients. In this randomized study, aerobic 
interval training for 12 weeks reduced the time in AF in patients with paroxysmal or persistent AF. It was associated with 
significant improvements in AF symptoms, exercise capacity, left atrial and ventricular function, lipid levels, and quality of 
life. These results support the growing evidence of a favorable effect on AF burden and disease progression by modulating 
cardiovascular risk factors and AF substrate. The reduction of time in AF, reduced AF symptoms, and improved quality of 
life induced by exercise training imply an important clinical benefit and support the concept that interventions aimed at life-
style and risk factors should be central in the management and prevention of AF. Exercise intervention in the study is within 
the intensity, duration, and frequency recommended in guidelines for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease. 
Further studies are needed to assess the safety of exercise training in AF patients and to find the optimal intensity and amount 
of exercise training over a longer period of time.
