Background-—Obesity is a risk factor for various subtypes of cardiovascular disease (CVD), including coronary heart disease (CHD),
heart failure (HF), and stroke. Nevertheless, there are limited comparisons of the associations of obesity with each of these CVD
subtypes, particularly regarding the extent to which they are unexplained by traditional CVD mediators.
Methods and Results-—We followed 13 730 participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study who had a body
mass index ≥18.5 and no CVD at baseline (visit 1, 1987–1989). We compared the association of higher body mass index with
incident HF, CHD, and stroke before and after adjusting for traditional CVD mediators (including systolic blood pressure, diabetes
mellitus, and lipid measures). Over a median follow-up of 23 years, there were 2235 HF events, 1653 CHD events, and 986
strokes. After adjustment for demographics, smoking, physical activity, and alcohol intake, higher body mass index had the
strongest association with incident HF among CVD subtypes, with hazard ratios for severe obesity (body mass index ≥35 versus
normal weight) of 3.74 (95% CI 3.24–4.31) for HF, 2.00 (95% CI 1.67–2.40) for CHD, and 1.75 (95% CI 1.40–2.20) for stroke
(P<0.0001 for comparisons of HF versus CHD or stroke). Further adjustment for traditional mediators fully explained the
association of higher body mass index with CHD and stroke but not with HF (hazard ratio 2.27, 95% CI 1.94–2.64).
Conclusions-—The link between obesity and HF was stronger than those for other CVD subtypes and was uniquely unexplained by
traditional risk factors. Weight management is likely critical for optimal HF prevention, and nontraditional pathways linking obesity
to HF need to be elucidated. (J Am Heart Assoc. 2016;5:e003921 doi: 10.1161/JAHA.116.003921)

O
besity is a common risk factor for several subtypes of
cardiovascular disease (CVD), including coronary heart
disease (CHD), stroke, and heart failure (HF)1–4; however,
increasing evidence suggests that obesity leads to various
subtypes of CVD through multiple distinct pathways. Some
traditional risk factors, including hypertension, diabetes
mellitus, and dyslipidemia, are established as mediators
between
obesity
and
atherosclerotic
vascular
disease.
Although weight management is a fundamental component
of CVD prevention, the majority of persons with obesity in the
general population do not achieve sufficient and sustained
weight loss.5–8 Consequently, there is great emphasis on
controlling the traditional CVD risk factors resulting from
obesity as a strategy for reducing cardiovascular risk.
Nevertheless, uniform approaches to the control of cardio-
vascular risk factors may not have the same impact on the
likelihood of developing different subtypes of CVD.
In this context, data conflict regarding whether the
relationships of obesity with CHD and stroke are independent
of established CVD mediators. Several prospective studies9–
16 and current scientific statements1 describe obesity as an
independent risk factor for CHD and stroke, whereas other
studies suggest that the associations are caused entirely by
established mediators.17–24 Nonetheless, a recent meta-
analysis indicated that most of the associations of obesity with
CHD and stroke may be mediated by hypertension, dyslipi-
demia, and diabetes mellitus.25 Notably, this meta-analysis

 did not include HF as an outcome, and indeed, data on an
independent association of obesity with incident HF are
relatively sparse.26–29 Most important, very few prospective
analyses have compared the association of obesity with each
of these CVD subtypes within the same population after
controlling for traditional CVD mediators.
It is possible that mechanisms other than hypertension,
dyslipidemia, and diabetes mellitus, such as excess metabolic
demand and direct adverse effects of adiposity on the
myocardium, play especially important roles in the develop-
ment of HF among persons with excess weight.30,31 If this is
the case, traditional CVD risk factor control alone may not
lead to optimal prevention of HF. In this prospective analysis
of white and black middle-aged men and women without
baseline CVD in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities
(ARIC) study, we compared the associations of obesity with
incident HF, CHD, and stroke before and after accounting for
traditional CVD mediators.
Methods
The ARIC study is a prospective, predominantly biracial,
community-based cohort of 15 792 participants extensively
characterized for cardiovascular risk factors and followed
longitudinally for CVD events.32 Participants were recruited
from 4 US population centers (Washington County, Maryland;
Jackson, Mississippi; Forsyth County, North Carolina; and the
suburbs of Minneapolis, Minnesota) and examined at a
baseline visit in the period from 1987 to 1989. Participants
were subsequently examined at 3 study visits spaced
�3 years apart and at a fifth visit conducted recently from
2011 to 2013.
Given the focus on incident CVD events, we excluded those
participants with a prior history of HF, CHD, stroke, or
peripheral vascular disease at the first ARIC study visit in the
period from 1987 to 1989 (n=1847). We also excluded those
with missing data on body mass index (BMI; kg/m2; n=25) or
with BMI <18.5 (n=142), along with the small number of
participants who were not of either black or white race
(n=48), leaving a study population of 13 730 participants.
Informed consent was obtained from all study participants,
and the institutional review boards affiliated with each ARIC
field center and with the coordinating center approved the
study protocol.
Information regarding covariates of interest was collected
at visit 1. The primary exposure was BMI, calculated from
measured weight and height (weight in kilograms divided by
square meters). Smoking status was categorized as current,
former, or never smoker. Self-reported alcohol use was
calculated in grams per week. Occupation was categorized
into subtypes of employment. Exercise physical activity was
self-reported
and
assessed
using
a
modified
Baecke
questionnaire, and each activity was subsequently converted
into metabolic equivalents of task based on the Compendium
of Physical Activities. Diabetes mellitus was defined as the
presence of fasting blood sugar ≥126 mg/dL, nonfasting
blood sugar ≥200 mg/dL, a self-reported prior physician
diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, or the use of hypoglycemic
medications. Systolic blood pressure was measured 3 times
during the same examination, and the average of the last 2
measurements was used for analysis. Enzymatic assays were
used to measure levels of total cholesterol, high-density
lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides; low-density lipopro-
tein cholesterol was calculated for those with triglycerides
≤400 mg/dL, using the Friedewald’s equation.33
The outcomes of interest were incident HF, CHD, and
stroke, with follow-up through December 31, 2012. After the
baseline visit, ARIC participants were followed continuously
for CVD events, receiving annual phone calls to obtain
information regarding hospitalizations. For all deaths, vital
records were examined, and in the majority of potential CHD
cases occurring out of hospital, an interview with the
decedent’s next of kin and a questionnaire completed by
the patient’s physician were also reviewed. Incident HF was
defined as the first hospitalization or death related to HF. HF
events were identified by discharge codes from hospitaliza-
tions and death certificates (International Classification of
Diseases, 9th Revision [ICD-9] code 428 for hospitalizations
and deaths in early years of follow-up and ICD-10 code I-50
for deaths in later years of follow-up). HF events from 2005
onward were also adjudicated by an expert panel.34 Incident
CHD was defined as an adjudicated event of definite or
probable nonfatal myocardial infarction or definite fatal CHD.
Potential incident strokes were identified by the presence of
related discharge codes (ICD-9 codes code 430–437), the
mention of a cerebrovascular condition or procedure in a
discharge summary, or the presence of stroke findings on a
computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging report.
If there was disagreement between automated and physician
diagnoses, events were adjudicated from abstracted medical
records by a third reviewer. Definite or probable strokes of
ischemic or hemorrhagic etiology were included in this
analysis.
Statistical Analysis
We performed univariate comparisons of baseline character-
istics across BMI categories (normal weight 18.5 to <25.0,
overweight 25.0 to <30.0, obese 30.0 to <35.0, and severely
obese ≥35.0), using ANOVA for continuous variables and the
chi-square test for categorical variables. Using Poisson
models, we calculated the adjusted incidence rates for each
CVD subtype associated with higher BMI at mean levels of
age, sex, race, smoking status, alcohol use, education level,

 occupation, and physical activity within the study population.
In addition to the aforementioned categories, BMI was
modeled continuously by constructing linear spline models
with knots at the BMI values of 25, 30, 35, 40, and 45. We
also assessed the median onset of incident events for each
subtype of CVD.
For each CVD subtype, we constructed Cox proportional
hazards models to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95%
CIs associated with higher BMI, with 2 levels of adjustment.
Model 1 was adjusted for the confounding variables of age
sex, race, smoking status, alcohol use, physical activity,
education level, and occupation. To estimate the associations
between obesity and each CVD subtype after accounting for
established mediators, model 2 was adjusted for the model 1
variables plus baseline values of traditional mediators of CVD
in the setting of obesity: diabetes mellitus, systolic blood
pressure, antihypertensive medication use, low- and high-
density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and estimated
glomerular filtration rate.
In sensitivity analyses, regression models were con-
structed for smoking status, hypertension, diabetes mellitus,
and
hypercholesterolemia
as time-varying
covariates
to
account for potential changes in these variables after the
baseline visit but prior to the onset of CVD events. In creating
time-varying covariates, measurements from ARIC visits 1, 2
(1990–1992), 3 (1993–1995), and 4 (1996–1999) were
incorporated into regression analyses if the visit took place
before an incident CVD event. Smoking status was catego-
rized as current smoker versus current nonsmoker; hyperten-
sion was defined as systolic blood pressure ≥140 mm Hg,
diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mm Hg, or use of antihyperten-
sive medications; diabetes mellitus was defined as described;
and hypercholesterolemia was defined as low-density lipopro-
tein cholesterol ≥160 mg/dL or the use of lipid-lowering
medications. For the latter 3 variables, after the onset of the
mediator, participants were considered to have that mediator
thereafter.
To formally compare the strength of associations for
obesity with incident HF, CHD, and stroke, we used
seemingly unrelated regression. This statistical approach
accounts for correlations of the error terms in the risk
equations for different outcomes within the same population
by estimating the risk equations jointly, providing a means
for formally comparing the magnitude of the different risk
associations.35
We performed analyses stratified by race, sex, and age
(≥60 or <60 years) and created product terms to assess for
differences in associations across demographic subgroups.
Sensitivity analyses were performed using only adjudicated
events of definite or probable incident HF from 2005 onward.
Additional sensitivity analyses were performed by adjusting
for baseline lung function (forced expiratory volume in 1
second and forced vital capacity), by including coronary
revascularization procedures (percutaneous intervention or
coronary artery bypass grafting) in the definition of incident
CHD, and by adding incident CHD to regression models as a
time-varying
covariate
to
evaluate
the
contribution
of
ischemic events to the association observed between obesity
and incident HF. To account for the possibility of death from
other causes that may have prevented participants from
experiencing one of the outcomes of interest, we also
performed competing risks regression analyses. In addition,
we performed analyses modeling obesity (BMI ≥30) from visits
1 through 4 as a time-varying covariate to account for the
impact of the development of obesity after the baseline ARIC
visit. Additional analyses were performed using waist circum-
ference, divided into sex-specific quartiles, as a secondary
metric of adiposity.
All P values presented are 2-sided. Statistical analyses
were performed using Stata version 13.1 (StataCorp LP).
Results
Baseline characteristics of the study population are displayed
in Table 1. Those with severe obesity were younger, were
most likely to be female and black, were least likely to be
current smokers, and had the lowest average levels of
exercise physical activity. Higher BMI categories were asso-
ciated with higher systolic blood pressure, triglycerides, and
estimated
glomerular
filtration
rate;
lower
high-density
lipoprotein cholesterol; and greater prevalence of antihyper-
tensive medication use and diabetes mellitus.
Over �23 years of follow-up, there were 2235 HF events,
1653 CHD events, and 986 strokes. For each subtype of CVD,
higher BMI was associated with a greater adjusted incidence
of events at mean levels of demographic variables, smoking,
alcohol use, and physical activity (Figure 1). The incidence
rate difference for severe obesity versus normal weight (per
1000 person-years) was 12.1 for HF, 4.0 for CHD, and 2.7 for
stroke. The median time to incident events for each CVD
subtype was 15.7 years for HF, 12.7 years for CHD, and
13.7 years for stroke.
In regression models adjusted for confounding variables
(model 1), overweight status and obesity were significantly
associated with increased HRs for each CVD subtype;
however, the strongest associations with higher BMI were
seen for incident HF (Table 2). Severe obesity, for example,
was associated with a nearly 4-fold higher risk of incident HF
(HR 3.74, 95% CI 3.24–4.31) and a �2-fold higher risk of CHD
(HR 2.00, 95% CI 1.67–2.40) and stroke (HR 1.75, 95% CI
1.40–2.20) compared with normal weight. In seemingly
unrelated regression analyses, the risk coefficient between
severe obesity and incident HF was significantly greater than
those for incident CHD and stroke (P<0.0001 for both

 comparisons). In the confounder-adjusted model, with BMI
modeled linearly, each 5-U increase in BMI was associated
with a 46% higher risk of incident HF compared with 22% and
16% higher risks for incident CHD and stroke, respectively
(P<0.0001 for comparisons of risk coefficients).
After further adjustment for traditional CVD mediators
(model 2), a statistically significant association remained
between higher BMI and incident HF (HR for severe obesity
2.27, 95% CI 1.94–2.64), but no significant associations were
seen for incident CHD and stroke. Similarly, in the fully
adjusted model, every 5-U increase in BMI was associated
with a 29% higher risk of incident HF, whereas no significant
associations were seen for CHD and stroke. Our findings were
analogous when BMI was modeled continuously in linear
spline models (Figure 2).
In regression analyses stratified by demographic sub-
groups using the fully adjusted model, significant associations
between higher BMI category and incident HF were seen

(Figure 3). Notably, a trend toward weaker associations
between higher BMI and incident HF was seen among
black
participants
in
comparison
to
white
participants
(Pinteraction=0.4), although significant associations were seen
for both races. In contrast, no significant associations
between higher BMI and either incident CHD or stroke were
seen in any of the demographic subgroups after adjustment
for both confounders and traditional CVD mediators (data not
shown).
Similar findings were seen when smoking status, hyper-
tension, diabetes mellitus, and hypercholesterolemia from
ARIC visits 1 through 4 were modeled as time-varying
covariates (Table 3), with severe obesity having a mildly
positive association with incident CHD (HR 1.20, 95% CI
1.02–1.41) and no significant association with stroke (HR
1.15, 95% CI 0.90–1.47) compared with a stronger associ-
ation with incident HF (HR 2.18, 95% CI 1.87–2.54). Notably,
in this time-varying analysis, HF was the only outcome for
which significant associations remained for the obese cate-
gory (BMI 30.0–34.9).
Our findings were similar in sensitivity analyses using only
adjudicated HF events (n=663), with severe obesity associ-
ated with an HR of 2.22 (95% CI 1.74–2.85) for incident HF
compared with normal weight in the fully adjusted model.
Findings were also not appreciably different when lung
function was included in regression models, when revascu-
larization procedures were included in the definition of
incident CHD, or when incident CHD was modeled as a time-
varying covariate on the outcome of incident HF. Similar
findings were also seen in competing risks regression
analyses to account for the possibility of non-CVD death
precluding the development of the outcomes of interest.
Analogous findings were seen when obesity (defined as BMI
≥30) was modeled as a time-varying covariate to account for
the onset of obesity after the baseline ARIC visit, with
significant associations seen only for incident HF after
adjustment for traditional CVD mediators (Table 4). In
analyses using waist circumference divided into quartiles
as a secondary measure of adiposity, higher waist circum-
ference quartiles were significantly associated with only
incident HF (HR 1.96, 95% CI 1.70–2.27, for quartile 4

Discussion
In this prospective analysis of a biracial community-based
cohort of 13 730 adult men and women without baseline
CVD, we compared the relationship of higher BMI with
incident HF, CHD, and stroke. After controlling for confound-
ing variables, we found that overweight status and obesity
were most strongly associated with incident HF among CVD
subtypes. Severe obesity was linked to a nearly 4-fold higher
risk of incident HF compared with �2-fold higher risks for
incident CHD and stroke.
In regression analyses adjusting for both confounders and
traditional CVD mediators, we found that traditional mediators
explained all association of higher BMI with incident CHD and
stroke. In contrast, the relationship of obesity with incident HF
was largely unexplained bytraditional mediators. These findings
were qualitatively consistent across demographic subgroups.
Similar findings were seen when major risk factors and obesity
were modeled as time-varying covariates to account for their
potential onset after the baseline visit. Our results were also
largely unchanged when the analysis was restricted to adjudi-
cated HF events and when CHD was included in regression
models as a time-varying covariate to account for antecedent
myocardial infarction as a precipitant of HF.
The 2006 American Heart Association Scientific Statement
on obesity and CVD describes obesity as a risk factor for CHD
and stroke independent of established mediators,1 but prior
data on this subject have been inconsistent. Some prospec-
tive data suggested an association between obesity and CHD
and stroke beyond that explained by traditional CVD medi-
ators,10–12,14 whereas other longitudinal studies indicated
that extensive adjustment for these mediators fully explains
these associations.17,18,21 A meta-analysis indicated that at

 least half of the association between obesity and CHD and
three-quarters of the association between obesity and stroke
are likely explained by hypertension, dyslipidemia, and
hyperglycemia. The relatively limited prospective data regard-
ing an independent link between obesity and incident HF,
however, suggest a persistent risk association after account-
ing for traditional CVD mediators.26–29
Most notably, there are very limited analyses comparing the
relationship of obesity with HF, CHD, and stroke within the
same population. A recent analysis of a Norwegian cohort found
that “metabolically healthy” obese participants were at
increased risk for HF but not for acute myocardial infarction.28
Our study, using contemporary follow-up data in a biracial
community-based cohort, extended prior research by demon-
strating a much stronger relationship between obesity and
incident HF than with CHD and stroke within the same
population. Furthermore, among major CVD subtypes, the
obesity–HF relationship was the only one unexplained by
traditional risk factors.
The mechanisms underlying the association between
obesity and HF remain incompletely understood. Increased
fat mass is associated with expanded blood volume and
increased myocardial workload.31,36 Obesity is also associ-
ated with adverse cardiac remodeling and abnormalities of
myocardial structure and function, changes that are known to
precede the development of clinical HF.30,31,37 Several
adipokines, which are associated in particular with abdominal
obesity, are linked to structural and functional myocardial
abnormalities and increased HF risk.29,38–41 Increasing labo-
ratory and clinical data suggest a direct link between obesity
and myocardial injury that may predispose to fibrosis,
myocardial dysfunction, and future HF.42–44 Several pro-
cesses are hypothesized to contribute to myocardial injury
and dysfunction among persons with obesity, including
increased metabolic demand, the paracrine effects of adipose
tissue, and increased myocardial triglyceride accumulation
leading to myocardial damage and potential apoptosis44–46;
however, the pathophysiological links between obesity and HF
have not yet been fully elucidated.
Overweight status and obesity were associated with higher
risks for all forms of CVD, a finding of considerable public
health importance, given that the majority of the US adult
population falls into one of these weight categories. This
analysis, however, has particularly important implications for
HF prevention. The clinical importance of refining strategies
for HF prevention in obesity is reinforced by the finding that
the obesity–HF relationship was strongest among the incident
CVD subtypes. Although weight reduction remains advisable
as a first-line strategy for CHD and stroke prevention in the
setting of obesity, this analysis indicates that controlling the
traditional risk factors associated with obesity may address
much of the excess risk for these outcomes in this population.
In contrast, our findings suggest that controlling traditional
risk factors alone will not be sufficient to address the excess
risk of HF in association with obesity.
This study further indicates that weight management,
including the avoidance of weight gain and weight reduction
among those who are overweight or obese, is likely critical for

*The following risk factors were modeled as time varying covariates from ARIC visits 1 through 4 to account for their potential onset after the baseline visit: smoking status (current
smoker versus current nonsmoker); hypertension (defined as systolic blood pressure ≥140 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mm Hg, or use of antihypertensive medications); diabetes
mellitus (defined as fasting blood sugar ≥126 mg/dL, nonfasting blood sugar ≥200 mg/dL, self-reported prior physician diagnosis, or use of hypoglycemic medications); and
hypercholesterolemia (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ≥160 mg/dL or use of lipid-lowering medications). Measurements from study visits occurring before incident CVD events were
incorporated in regression analyses. For hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hypercholesterolemia, risk factors were considered to be present after onset. Regression models were
additionally adjusted for age, race, sex, alcohol use, occupation, education level, physical activity, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and estimated glomerular filtration rate.

 optimal HF prevention. Several prior analyses, however, have
documented the challenges of achieving significant and
sustained weight loss in the population setting,5–8 indicating
the importance of developing additional approaches to reduce
the risk of HF associated with obesity. These findings
underscore the need for further investigation to elucidate
the nontraditional pathways linking obesity to HF to inform
novel preventive strategies. In addition, the later onset of HF
relative to CHD and stroke among those with obesity may
indicate that the processes leading to myocardial dysfunction
and HF in this population generally require a cumulative effect
over an extended time period prior to the development of
clinical disease, and that period may provide an important
window for preventive interventions.
Although this analysis highlights the markedly increased
risk of incident HF associated with obesity, an “obesity
paradox” has been noted among those with prevalent HF,
among whom higher BMI is associated with increased
survival.47,48 Further investigation is needed to elucidate the
mechanisms underlying the obesity paradox and to under-
stand how the processes leading from obesity to incident HF
affect myocardial function, structure, and overall prognosis
among those who have already developed clinical HF.
This analysis has certain limitations. Although the ARIC
population was rigorously assessed regarding traditional risk
factors, the observational nature of this analysis makes the
presence of some residual confounding still possible. In
addition, the use of discharge codes for the diagnosis of HF
may have resulted in some misclassification, although anal-
yses restricted to only adjudicated HF events yielded largely
unchanged results. This analysis also does not account for
therapies administered during follow-up that may have had
variable effects on the risk of developing different subtypes of
CVD.
Nonetheless,
this
prospective
analysis
from
an
extremely
well-characterized
cohort
provides
important
insights regarding the relative associations of higher BMI
with different subtypes of incident CVD and the extent to
which the associations are unexplained by traditional CVD
mediators. The community-based design and the inclusion of
a biracial population of middle-aged men and women makes
the results broadly generalizable. The large number of events
allowed for direct statistical comparisons of the risk associ-
ations among obesity and different CVD subtypes and
permitted assessments of the robustness of the findings
across demographic subgroups.
In conclusion, this analysis demonstrates that the associ-
ations of overweight status and obesity with incident HF are
stronger than those for CHD and stroke. Although traditional
CVD mediators explained the associations of obesity with
CHD and stroke, the association between higher BMI and
incident HF was largely unexplained by adjustment for
traditional CVD risk factors and mediators. These findings
highlight the importance of weight management for optimal
HF prevention and the need to identify nontraditional
pathways linking obesity to incident HF to inform the
development of additional preventive strategies.
