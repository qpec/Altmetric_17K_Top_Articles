Global, regional, and national age-sex-specific mortality for 
282 causes of death in 195 countries and territories, 
1980–2017: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of 
Disease Study 2017
GBD 2017 Causes of Death Collaborators*
Summary
Background Global development goals increasingly rely on country-specific estimates for benchmarking a nation’s 
progress. To meet this need, the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2016 estimated 
global, regional, national, and, for selected locations, subnational cause-specific mortality beginning in the year 
1980. Here we report an update to that study, making use of newly available data and improved methods. GBD 2017 
provides a comprehensive assessment of cause-specific mortality for 282 causes in 195 countries and territories from 
1980 to 2017.
Methods The causes of death database is composed of vital registration (VR), verbal autopsy (VA), registry, survey, 
police, and surveillance data. GBD 2017 added ten VA studies, 127 country-years of VR data, 502 cancer-registry 
country-years, and an additional surveillance country-year. Expansions of the GBD cause of death hierarchy resulted 
in 18 additional causes estimated for GBD 2017. Newly available data led to subnational estimates for five additional 
countries—Ethiopia, Iran, New Zealand, Norway, and Russia. Deaths assigned International Classification of Diseases 
(ICD) codes for non-specific, implausible, or intermediate causes of death were reassigned to underlying causes by 
redistribution algorithms that were incorporated into uncertainty estimation. We used statistical modelling tools 
developed for GBD, including the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm), to generate cause fractions and cause-
specific death rates for each location, year, age, and sex. Instead of using UN estimates as in previous versions, 
GBD 2017 independently estimated population size and fertility rate for all locations. Years of life lost (YLLs) were 
then calculated as the sum of each death multiplied by the standard life expectancy at each age. All rates reported here 
are age-standardised.
Findings At the broadest grouping of causes of death (Level 1), non-communicable diseases (NCDs) comprised the 
greatest fraction of deaths, contributing to 73·4% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 72·5–74·1) of total deaths in 
2017, while communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional (CMNN) causes accounted for 18·6% (17·9–19·6), 
and injuries 8·0% (7·7–8·2). Total numbers of deaths from NCD causes increased from 2007 to 2017 by 22·7% 
(21·5–23·9), representing an additional 7·61 million (7·20–8·01) deaths estimated in 2017 versus 2007. The death 
rate from NCDs decreased globally by 7·9% (7·0–8·8). The number of deaths for CMNN causes decreased by 
22·2% (20·0–24·0) and the death rate by 31·8% (30·1–33·3). Total deaths from injuries increased by 2·3% 
(0·5–4·0) between 2007 and 2017, and the death rate from injuries decreased by 13·7% (12·2–15·1) to 
57·9 deaths (55·9–59·2) per 100 000 in 2017. Deaths from substance use disorders also increased, rising from 
284 000 deaths (268 000–289 000) globally in 2007 to 352 000 (334 000–363 000) in 2017. Between 2007 and 2017, 
total deaths from conflict and terrorism increased by 118·0% (88·8–148·6). A greater reduction in total deaths and 
death rates was observed for some CMNN causes among children younger than 5 years than for older adults, 
such as a 36·4% (32·2–40·6) reduction in deaths from lower respiratory infections for children younger than 
5 years compared with a 33·6% (31·2–36·1) increase in adults older than 70 years. Globally, the number of 
deaths was greater for men than for women at most ages in 2017, except at ages older than 85 years. Trends in 
global YLLs reflect an epidemiological transition, with decreases in total YLLs from enteric infections, respiratory 
infections and tuberculosis, and maternal and neonatal disorders between 1990 and 2017; these were generally 
greater in magnitude at the lowest levels of the Socio-demographic Index (SDI). At the same time, there 
were large increases in YLLs from neoplasms and cardiovascular diseases. YLL rates decreased across 
the five leading Level 2 causes in all SDI quintiles. The leading causes of YLLs in 1990—neonatal disorders, 
lower respiratory infections, and diarrhoeal diseases—were ranked second, fourth, and fifth, in 2017. Meanwhile, 
estimated YLLs increased for ischaemic heart disease (ranked first in 2017) and stroke (ranked third), even 
though YLL rates decreased. Population growth contributed to increased total deaths across the 20 leading 
Level 2 causes of mortality between 2007 and 2017. Decreases in the cause-specific mortality rate reduced the effect 
of population growth for all but three causes: substance use disorders, neurological disorders, and skin and 
subcutaneous diseases.

Introduction
Systematic recording and analysis of causes of 
human death remains one of the most resilient successes 
for public health, beginning with routine and continuous 
reporting of deaths by physicians starting in the 
15th century.1 Today, hundreds of thousands of physicians 
evaluate and select the cause of death for millions of 
deaths annually, codifying the results according to the 
International Classification of Diseases (ICD) system.2 
These efforts form the basis of a global mortality 
reporting system that is widely relied upon to prioritise 
health system investments, track progress towards 
global development goals, and guide scientific research. 
Although there remains a need for wider adoption and 
improvement of these systems, continuous reporting of 
cause-specific mortality in many countries represents a 
success for global health.3
More mortality data are now becoming available 
because of broader adoption of vital registration 
systems and increased information-sharing made 
possible by digital communication. At the same time, 
efforts to correct, sort, analyse, and report this massive 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Previously, the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk 
Factors Study (GBD) 2016 provided estimates for 264 causes of 
death for 195 countries and territories, by age and sex, from 1980 
to 2016. GBD 2016 incorporated newly available data for many 
locations, expanded and refined the included causes of death, 
improved modelling techniques, and developed a star rating 
system for the quality of cause of death data. To better assess 
mortality among the oldest adults, terminal age categories for 
age 90–94 years and 95 years and older were added. Other 
organisations periodically produce estimates of cause‐specific 
mortality, including for a wide list of causes and across multiple 
age groups (WHO), for selected cancers (the International Agency 
for Research on Cancer), and for child deaths (the Maternal and 
Child Epidemiology Estimation [MCEE] group). GBD continues to 
provide the only peer‐reviewed annual estimates of cause‐specific 
mortality available for all locations over time.
Added value of this study
GBD 2017 includes estimates for 2017 and also updates the 
entire series from 1980 produced for GBD 2016. The list of 
included causes has been expanded and study methods have 
been improved in multiple ways. First, inclusion of an 
independent estimation of population and fertility developed 
for GBD 2017 substantially improved estimates in selected 
countries. Second, additional data were identified, including 
127 country‐years of vital registration and ten verbal autopsy 
studies. Third, new subnational assessments were developed 
for five countries in 2017: Ethiopia, Iran, New Zealand, Norway, 
and Russia. Fourth, a new stratum was developed for 
subnational‐level estimation in New Zealand to characterise 
populations by ethnicity as Māori or non‐Māori. Fifth, we 
revised adjustments made for misclassified deaths due to 
dementia, Parkinson’s disease, and atrial fibrillation. Finally, 
additional diseases are now estimated, including 
non‐rheumatic calcific aortic and degenerative mitral valve 
disease; subarachnoid haemorrhage; myelodysplastic, 
myeloproliferative, and other haemopoietic disorders; 
diabetes mellitus as type 1 and type 2 (previously combined); 
poisoning by carbon monoxide; liver cancer due to 
non‐alcoholic steatohepatitis; ectopic pregnancy; and invasive 
non‐typhoidal salmonella.
Implications of all the available evidence
Deaths due to communicable, maternal, neonatal, and 
nutritional causes continue to decline, while deaths from non‐
communicable diseases increase and injury deaths are stable. 
Declines in death rates of some non‐communicable diseases 
have slowed or ceased. GBD 2017 has increased its 
collaboration with governments, leading to additional data 
for subnational estimation. Engagement with GBD 
collaborators, policy makers, disease experts, and the public is 
guiding expansions of the cause list and resulting decreasing 
burden classified in residual “other” categories. 
Non‐communicable diseases remain the leading causes of 
death globally, and their burden is rising. GBD 2017 is 
motivated by the same goals as GBD 2016, including the belief 
that annual updates, reflecting improvements due to 
improved data availability, new causes estimated, and better 
methods to reduce bias and improve transparency in 
reporting, are contributing to the formulation and tracking of 
new evidence‐based health policy. We intend for GBD 2017 to 
serve as a global public good, freely available for policy makers 
and the public seeking to improve human health.
Interpretation Improvements in global health have been unevenly distributed among populations. Deaths due to 
injuries, substance use disorders, armed conflict and terrorism, neoplasms, and cardiovascular disease are expanding 
threats to global health. For causes of death such as lower respiratory and enteric infections, more rapid progress 
occurred for children than for the oldest adults, and there is continuing disparity in mortality rates by sex across age 
groups. Reductions in the death rate of some common diseases are themselves slowing or have ceased, primarily for 
NCDs, and the death rate for selected causes has increased in the past decade.

amount of global data are evolving to keep pace with 
increasing demands for timely assessment of global, 
regional, and local mortality patterns. In addition to 
shifts in mortality patterns due to an ongoing 
epidemiological transition, rapid spikes in mortality 
due to specific causes are frequently observed and 
require recurrent updates to global estimates. Examples 
of mortality spikes include opioid-associated deaths in 
parts of the USA,4 suicide in eastern Europe in the 
1990s,5 and conflict-associated deaths in the eastern 
Mediterranean and North Africa region.6 Causes of 
death are now reported digitally in many locations, 
allowing health authorities to improve the quality and 
timeliness of mortality reporting.7,8 Global development 
goals increasingly rely on country-specific estimates for 
benchmarking 
a 
nation’s 
progress. 
Global 
commitments, 
such as the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs),9 the Moscow Declaration to End Tuberculosis,10 
WHO’s First Global Conference on Air Pollution and 
Health11 in October, 2018, and the UN High-level 
Meetings on NCDs12 and tuberculosis,13 both in 
September, 2018, will require ongoing tracking of 
cause-specific mortality, including in locations where 
mortality surveillance data remain limited.
The following study represents an annual update to 
the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors 
Study (GBD), an effort to produce consistent and com-
parable estimates of cause-specific mortality for all 
locations globally. GBD 2017 includes results by age and 
sex, for the years 1980 through to 2017, for 195 countries 
and territories. A cycle of continuous quality improve-
ment has led to substantial changes, including new data 
sources, new causes of death, and updated methods. 
For the first time, population estimates have been 
independently produced by GBD 2017,14 and subna-
tional estimates have been produced for Ethiopia, Iran, 
New Zealand, Norway, and Russia. The purpose of GBD 
2017 is to serve as a global public good, freely available 
for policy makers and the public seeking to improve 
human health.
Methods
Overview
GBD cause of death estimation incorporates methods to 
adjust for incomplete or missing vital registration (VR) 
and verbal autopsy (VA) data, general heterogeneity in 
data completeness and quality, and the redistribution 
of so-called garbage codes (insufficiently specific or 
implausible cause of death codes). A general description 
of these methods is provided in this section, with further 
detail presented in appendix 1. GBD 2017 complied with 
the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health 
Estimates Reporting (GATHER)15 statement (appendix 1 
section 1.3). Analyses were completed with Python 
version 2.7.14, Stata version 13.1, and R version 3.3.2. 
Statistical code used for GBD estimation is publicly 
available online.
Geographical units and time periods
The locations included in GBD 2017 have been arranged 
into a set of hierarchical categories composed of seven 
super-regions and a further nested set of 21 regions 
containing 195 countries and territories (appendix 1). 
Each year, GBD includes sub 
national analyses for a few 
new countries and continues to provide subnational 
estimates for countries that were added in previous cycles. 
Subnational estimation in GBD 2017 includes five new 
countries (Ethiopia, Iran, New Zealand, Norway, Russia) 
and countries previously estimated at subnational levels 
(GBD 2013: China, Mexico, and the UK [regional level]; 
GBD 2015: Brazil, India, Japan, Kenya, South Africa, 
Sweden, and the USA; GBD 2016: Indonesia and the UK 
[local government authority level]). All analyses are at the 
first level of administrative organisation within each 
country except for New Zealand (by Māori ethnicity), 
Sweden (by Stockholm and non-Stockholm), and the UK 
(by local government authorities). All subnational 
estimates for these countries were incorporated into 
model development and evaluation as part of GBD 2017
. 
To meet data use requirements, in this publication we 
present all subnational estimates excluding those pending 
publication (Brazil, India, Japan, Kenya, Mexico, Sweden, 
the UK, and the USA); because of space constraints these 
selected subnational results are presented in appendix 2. 
Subnational estimates for countries with populations 
larger than 200 million (measured with our most recent 
year of published estimates) that have not yet been 
published elsewhere are presented wherever estimates 
are illustrated with maps but are not included in data 
tables.
The complete cause-specific estimation results include 
the years 1980 through to 2017, and are available for 
exploration by an online data visualisation tool. To better 
support current health policy assessment, we include a 
subset of analyses in the current study featuring the 
most recent interval, 2007–17
. 
The GBD cause of death hierarchy
The GBD study attributes each death to a single 
underlying cause that began the series of events leading 
to death, in accordance with ICD principles. The GBD 
study organises causes of death in a hierarchical list 
containing four levels (appendix 1 section 7). At the 
highest level (Level 1), all disease burden is divided 
among three mutually exclus 
ive and collectively 
exhaustive 
categor 
ies: 
communicable, 
maternal, 
neonatal, and nutritional (CMNN) diseases; non-
communicable diseases (NCDs); and injuries. Level 2 
distinguishes these Level 1 categories into 21 cause 
groups, such as cardiovascular diseases; diarrhoeal 
diseases, lower respiratory infections (LRIs), and other 
common infectious diseases; or transport injuries. 
Level 3 disaggregates these causes further; in most 
cases this disaggregation represents the finest level of 
detail by cause, such as stroke, ischaemic heart disease,

or road injuries. Where data are sufficiently available or 
specific policy relevance has been sought, selected 
causes are further disaggregated at Level 4, such as 
drug-susceptible 
tuberculosis, 
multidrug-resistant 
tubercu 
losis without extensive drug resistance, and 
extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis. For GBD 2017, 
the cause hierarchy was further refined to separately 
estimate causes with sub 
stantial policy interest or high 
levels of burden. Specific changes included separate 
estimation of non-rheumatic calcific aortic and degen-
erative mitral valve dis 
eases, and myelodysplastic, 
myeloproliferative, and other haemo 
poietic neoplasms, 
resulting in a reduction in the estim 
ates of some 
residual causes. Disaggregation of residual causes also 
allowed separate estimation of type 1 and type 2 diabetes, 
chronic kidney disease due to type 1 and type 2 diabetes, 
poisoning by carbon monox 
ide, liver cancer due to 
non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), subarachnoid 
haemorrhage, ectopic pregnancy, and invasive non-
typhoidal salmonella. Maternal and neonatal disorders, 
previously estimated as separate cause groupings at 
Level 2 of the hierarchy, were estimated for GBD 2017 
at Level 3 of the hierarchy, and then aggregated up to 
Level 2 to better capture the epidemiological connections 
and linked burden between them. The complete 
hierarchy of causes included in GBD 2017 and their 
corresponding ICD9 and ICD10 codes are described in 
appendix 1 (section 7).
Cause of death data
The GBD cause of death database consists of VR and VA 
data; survey and census data for injuries and maternal 
mortality; surveillance data for maternal mortality and 
child death; cancer registries; and police records for 
interpersonal violence and road injuries. Self-harm 
estimates incorporate VR data and are based on ICD 
categorisation as described in appendix 1 (section 7). In 
this iteration of GBD, ten new VA studies and 127 new 
country-years of VR data were added at the country 
level. 502 new cancer-registry country-years were 
added, as was one additional new surveillance country-
year. Data sources comprising the GBD cause of 
death database can be reviewed on the Global Health 
Data Exchange website. Multiple factors can influence 
changes between GBD studies in estimates for a given 
cause-location-year, including the quality of a country’s 
data system (as represented by the GBD star rating 
system) and the addition of more recent data. 
Figure 1 shows the relative stability of GBD estimates 
between study iterations. Variation between GBD 2016 
and GBD 2017 estimates was greater in countries with 
both low star ratings and no new VR data updates 
occurring between these iterations of the study. Changes 
to estimates can be seen even in high star rating 
locations because of changes in modelling strategy or 
model covariates even when no new VR data were 
available between cycles.
Data standardisation and processing
To standardise cause of death data, we used protocols 
to address the minor proportion of deaths that were 
assigned to age groups broader than the GBD five-year 
age groups or were not assigned an age or sex, and to 
address differences in ICD codes due to national 
variation or revision, as described in appendix 1 
(section 2). Garbage codes, deaths with non-specific 
codes (eg, unspecified stroke), deaths assigned to ICD 
codes that could not be underlying causes of death 
(eg, senility), or deaths assigned to intermediate but 
not underlying causes of death (eg, heart failure), were 
redistributed by age, sex, location, and year to the 
most likely causes of death. Methods used for this 
redistribution included regression models, redistri-
bution based on fixed proportions, pro 
portional 
reassignment, and fractional assignment of a death 
assigned to multiple causes, as developed by Naghavi 
and colleagues16 and detailed in appendix 1 (section 2.7). 
We excluded all data sources with more than 50% of 
deaths assigned to major garbage codes (those at 
Level 1 or Level 2 of the GBD hierarchy) in any location-
year to mitigate the potential for bias from these 
sources. The proportion of VR data assigned to major 
garbage code categories for each location-year is 
shown, with supporting detail, in appendix 1 (section 7). 
New to GBD 2017, the uncertainty around re-
distribution methods was also estimated. Additional 
details for this process are provided in appendix 1 
(section 2.7). Because mortality due to HIV/AIDS is 
sometimes coded to other causes of death such as 
tuberculosis, meningitis, or toxoplasmosis, we also 
corrected the cause of death assignment to HIV/AIDS 
for peak epidemic times. Tuberculosis deaths can be 
misclassified as pneumonia deaths in children in 
locations with a high tuberculosis burden. Methods to 
adjust for this potential mis 
classi 
fication are described 
in detail in appendix 1 (section 3.3).
Mortality rates from dementia and Parkinson’s disease 
reported in VR systems cannot be reconciled with 
observed trends in prevalence and excess mortality—a 
disparity that can be attributed to variation in death 
certification practices for these causes across countries 
and over time.17 For GBD 2017, we sought to address this 
known bias by using details from multiple cause of 
death data. For GBD 2017, multiple cause of death data 
were available to investigators only for the USA, where 
recent years show improved use of previously under-
utilised codes such as dementia. Statistical models of 
these USA data were used to reclassify deaths from 
other GBD causes and garbage codes to dementia and 
Parkinson’s disease according to the pattern of 
intermediate and immediate causes observed in the 
most recent years. Model results were applied to all 
countries. A similar reallocation pro 
cess was used for 
atrial fibrillation deaths misclassified as deaths due to 
heart failure or thromboembolic events. A detailed

description of these redistribution procedures and the 
manner in which they were applied to all countries is 
available in section 2 of appendix 1. This reallocation is 
illustrated in appendix 1 (section 7).
For the first time in GBD 2017, we separately estimated 
deaths from diabetes by type. Deaths due to diabetes can 
be reported in VR and VA data as type 1, type 2, or 
unspecified. Two data manipulation steps were necessary. 
First, we assumed all deaths reported in individuals 
younger than 15 years were type 1 regardless of the 
original code assignment. Second, we redistributed 
unspecified diabetes deaths on the basis of a regression 
in which the true proportions of type 1 and type 2 deaths 
by age-sex-location-year are a function of the proportion 
of unspecified deaths, age, the age-standardised pre-
valence of obesity, and an interaction term for age and 
obesity prevalence. These methods are described in detail 
in appendix 1 (section 3.3).
Figure 1: Effect of new VR data on Level 1 cause estimates from GBD 2016 to GBD 2017, based on national locations with varying quality of VR data, 2008–16  
The figure shows the degree of consistency between GBD 2016 and GBD 2017 estimates for Level 1 causes at the national level from 2008 to 2016. The diagonal line represents no change from 
GBD 2016 to GBD 2017. Each point represents one country‐year, with colours indicating the Level 1 cause grouping (communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases; non‐communicable 
diseases; and injuries). Panels indicate whether or not any new VR data between 2008 and 2016 were added for that location for GBD 2017, and whether or not a location has 4‐star or 5‐star VR 
quality. Points that are outside of the standard 95% prediction interval for a linear regression of 2017 values on 2016 values are annotated (if the same location‐cause had multiple points in a time 
series, only the furthest‐most point was annotated). The Spearman’s correlation coefficient is noted in the lower right‐hand corner of each panel. CSMR=cause‐specific mortality rate. GBD=Global 
Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study. VR=vital registration.

Data completeness assessment
Completeness of VR data was assessed by location-year, 
and sources with less than 50% completeness were 
excluded. We multiplied the estimated all-cause mor 
tality 
for each age-sex-location-year by the cause fraction for the 
corresponding age-sex-location-year to adjust all included 
sources to 100% completeness. VA and VR data availability 
and completeness are shown for each location-year in 
appendix 1 (section 7). To further char 
acterise the quality 
of data available in each country, the GBD study rated 
each location-year from 1980 to 2017 on a level of 0 to 
5 stars according to methods previously described.18 
Ratings convey an overall measure of the reliability of 
cause of death estimates for each location-year but do not 
directly affect the estimation process.
Cause of death estimation with CODEm
The GBD Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm) 
systematically tested and combined results from 
different statistical models according to their out-of-
sample pre 
dictive validity. Results are incorporated into 
a weighted ensemble model as detailed in appendix 1 
(section 3.1) and below. For GBD 2017, CODEm was 
used to estimate 192 causes of death (appendix 1 
section 7). To predict the level for each cause of death, 
we used CODEm to systematically test a large number 
of functional forms and permutations of covariates.18 
Each resulting model that met the predetermined req-
uirements for regression coefficient significance and 
direction was fit on 70% of the data, holding out 30% for 
cross-validation (appendix 1 section 3.1). Out-of-sample 
pre 
dictive validity of these models was assessed by use 
of repeated cross-validation tests on the first 15% of the 
held-out data. Various ensemble models with different 
weighting parameters were created from the com-
bination of these models, with the highest weights 
assigned to models with the best out-of-sample pre-
diction error for trends and levels, as detailed in 
appendix 1 (section 7). Model performance of these 
ensembles was assessed against the root-mean squared 
error (RMSE) of the ensemble model predictions of the 
log of the age-specific death rates for a cause, assessed 
with the same 15% of the data. The ensemble model 
performing best was subsequently selected and 
assessed against the other 15% of the data withheld 
from the statistical model building. CODEm was run 
independently by sex for each cause of death. A separate 
model was run for countries with 4-star or greater 
VR systems to avert uncertainty inflation from more 
heterogeneous data. The distribution of RMSE relative 
to cause-specific mortality rates (CSMRs) at Level 2 of 
the GBD hierarchy shows that model performance was 
weakest for causes of death with comparatively low 
mortality rates (figure 2; appendix 2), while models for 
more common causes of death such as stroke, chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease, and self-harm and 
interpersonal violence generally had low RMSE.
Cause of death estimation with alternative estimation 
strategies
Alternative estimation strategies were used to model a 
subset of causes of death with unique epidemiology, 
large changes in reporting over time, or particularly 
limited data availability, including HIV/AIDS, malaria, 
chronic kidney disease, cirrhosis, liver cancer, men-
ingitis, de 
mentia, and atrial fibrillation. Alternative 
strategies included prevalence-based models, incidence 
and case fatality models, and sub-cause proportion 
models as described in appendix 1 (section 7). Mortality-
incidence ratio models based on registry data were used 
to estimate mortality from 32 cancers (appendix 1 
section 3.3). Negative-binomial models were used for 
eight causes of death with typically low death counts 
or causes that typically have no deaths in countries 
with a high Socio-demographic Index (SDI), includ-
ing ascariasis, cystic echinococcosis, cysticer 
cosis, 
diphtheria, iodine deficiency, other intestinal infectious 
diseases, schistosomiasis, and varicella and herpes 
zoster virus. Once underlying cause of death estimates 
and accompanying uncertainty were generated, these 
models were combined with the cause of death 
correction procedure (CoDCorrect) to establish estimates 
consistent with all-cause mortality levels for each age-
sex-year location.
Estimation of fatal discontinuities
Fatal discontinuities are large changes in deaths due to 
unexpected spikes in injuries or epidemics—defined by 
GBD as more than one per million or more than 
Figure 2: Out-of-sample model performance for CODEm models and age-standardised cause-specific 
mortality rate by Level 1 causes
Model performance was defined by the root‐mean squared error of the ensemble model predictions of the log of 
the age‐specific death rates for a cause with 15% of the data held out from the statistical model building. The figure 
shows the association between the root‐mean squared error and the log of the CSMR, aggregated over 1980–2017. 
Each point represents one CODEm model specific for model‐specific age ranges and sex. Circles denote models run 
with all locations. Triangles denote models run on only data‐rich locations. Colours denote the Level 1 cause 
categories. Open circles and triangles denote models that were run with restricted age groups of less than 30 years.

25 deaths—in a specific location-year. We classified 
fatal discontinuities as conflict and terrorism, major 
trans 
portation accidents, natural disasters, other forms 
of disaster such as large fires or the collapse of large 
buildings, or major outbreaks of infectious diseases. 
Data on fatal discontinuities came from VR data in the 
75 countries with a 4-star or 5-star data quality rat-
ing for the interval of 1980–2017
. For the remaining 
120 countries with a rating of 3 stars or lower, we used 
alternative databases (appendix 1 section 7). Cholera 
and meningitis were estimated as fatal discontinuities to 
reduce the risk of underestimation for small-magnitude 
outbreaks caused by the smoothing of VR or VA data 
over time in CODEm. To address lags in reporting and 
publishing of data, we included news reports and other 
supplemental data sources when known gaps existed. 
Further detail about fatal discontinuity estimation is 
presented in appendix 1 (section 3.3).
Pathogen counterfactual analysis
Aetiology-specific mortality was estimated for LRIs and 
diarrhoeal diseases by use of a counterfactual approach 
that relates the frequency of each aetiology in a 
population and the association with that aetiology and 
either LRI or diarrhoea. LRI and diarrhoea were selected 
as initial candidates for this counterfactual analysis 
approach given the large disease burden they represent 
and the broad interest in interventions, mostly vaccine-
based, to reduce their burden.19 We attributed LRI 
deaths to four aetiologies: Haemophilus influenzae 
type B pneumonia, Streptococcus pneumoniae pneum-
ococcal pneumonia, influenza, and respiratory syncyt 
ial 
virus pneumonia. Diarrhoeal deaths were attribu-
ted to 13 aetiologies: adenovirus, Aeromonas spp, 
Campylobacter spp, Clostridium difficile, cryptospori-
diosis (Cryptosporidium spp), amoebiasis (Entamoeba 
histolytica), typical entero 
patho 
genic Escherichia coli, 
enterotoxigenic E coli, noro 
virus, rotavirus, non-
typhoidal Salmonella spp, shigellosis (Shigella spp), and 
cholera (Vibrio cholerae). The mortality attributable to 
each aetiology is the product of the attributable fraction 
and the mortality due to LRI or diarrhoea. The current 
counterfactual analysis is an extension of work begun in 
GBD 2010, based on the most common pathogens and 
available data. This method allows for less common 
aetiologies to be added in the future.
YLL computation
Years of life lost (YLLs) are a measure of premature death 
calculated as the sum of each death multiplied by the 
standard life expectancy at each age. The standard life 
expectancy was taken from the lowest observed risk of 
death for each five-year age group in all populations 
greater than 5 million. In 2017, GBD 2017 included a 
new demographic assessment of population, fertility, 
migration, and all-cause mortality.14 We used these 
components to generate single calendar-year and single 
age-year estimates of the population using transparent 
and replicable methods.14 This independent assessment 
of the population was subsequently used in the calcula-
tion of YLL rates and age-standardised mortality rates. 
Details of these calculations are available in appendix 1 
(section 4.3).
Decomposition of change in global deaths
Using methods adapted from demographic research 
from Das Gupta,20 we decomposed change in numbers of 
deaths by cause from 2007 to 2017, using three ex-
planatory components: as change occurring from growth 
in the total population; as shifts in population structure 
by age; or as changes in cause-specific mortality rates. 
We calculated the fraction of change in deaths by cause 
from each component using counter 
factual scenarios, 
changing the level of one factor from 2007 to 2017, with 
all other factors held constant. Since the effect depends 
on the order of entry of the factor, we calculated the 
average of all combinations of the three factors. Thus, the 
change in global deaths due to shifts in population age 
structure could be calculated by comparing the number 
of deaths in 2007 to the number of deaths in 2017, using 
the population age structure from 2017 and holding both 
population size and cause-specific mortality rates at 2007 
levels (appendix 1 section 7).
Uncertainty analysis
Uncertainty in our estimates was attributable to cause-
specific model specifications; varied availability of data by 
age, sex, location, or year; and variability of sample size 
within data sources. We quantified and propagated 
uncertainty into final estimates by calculating uncertainty 
intervals (UIs) for cause-specific estimation components 
based on 1000 draws from the posterior distribu 
tion 
of cause-specific mortality by age, sex, location, and 
year.21 95% UIs were calculated with the 2·5th and 
97·5th percentiles, and point estimates were calculated 
from the mean of the draws. Changes over time were 
considered statistically significant when the uncertainty 
interval of the percentage change over time did not cross 
zero.
Socio-demographic Index and epidemiological 
transition analysis
The SDI is a value between 0·0 and 1·0 calculated from 
the geometric mean of three rescaled components: total 
fertility rate under 25 years (TFRU25), lag-distributed 
income per capita (LDI), and average educational 
attainment in the population older than 15 years.22 
Because the total fertility rate—used in the calculation 
of SDI for GBD 2016—has a U-shaped association at 
the highest levels of development, for GBD 2017 we 
recomputed the SDI using TFRU25 only, an age range for 
which the association with development is clearest.14 We 
used a generalised additive model with a Loess smoother 
on SDI to estimate the association between SDI and each

age-sex-cause death rate using GBD estimates from all 
national locations across all years from 1980 to 2017 
(appendix 1 section 7). Expected cause-specific death rates 
were scaled to the expected all-cause death rate to ensure 
internal consistency. We then computed the number of 
YLLs and deaths expected for each age-sex-location-year 
based on SDI alone and compared these estimates to 
observed rates. Additional details of the development and 
calculation of SDI for GBD 2017 are described in 
appendix 1 (section 5).

Global causes of death
Mortality estimates by cause for the years 1990, 2007, and 
2017 are available by age and sex through the GBD results 
tool and for each year in the GBD estimation period 
1980–2017 through the online data visualisation tool. All 
reported rates are age-standardised.
In 2017, at the broadest level of cause of death 
classification in the GBD cause list (Level 1), CMNN 
causes accounted for 18·6% (95% UI 17·9–19·6) of 
total deaths or 10·4 million (10·0–11·0) deaths in 2017, 
while non-communicable causes (NCDs) accounted for 
73·4% (72·5–74·1) or 41·1 million (40·5–41·5) deaths, 
and injuries accounted for 8·0% (7·7–8·2) of deaths or 
4·48 million (4·33–4·59) deaths (table 1). Of the 
1·65 billion (1·62–1·67) global YLLs in 2017, 35·1% 
(34·2–36·2) were from CMNN causes, 53·0% (52·2–53·8) 
were from NCDs, and the remaining 11·9% (11·5–12·1) 
were from injuries. Both the number of deaths and death 
rates from CMNN causes decreased from 2007 to 2017, by 
22·2% (20·0–24·0) in terms of total deaths and by 31·8% 
(30·1–33·3) in terms of mortality rate. Decreases in the 
number and rate of YLLs from CMNN causes were 
similar in magnitude (30·4% [28·2–32·4] decrease in 
YLLs; 35·4% [33·4–37·3] decrease in YLL rate) over the 
same time period. By contrast, total deaths from NCD 
causes increased between 2007 and 2017 by 22·7% 
(21·5–23·9) and total YLLs from NCD causes increased 
by 13·6% (12·2–14·9), repre 
senting an additional 7·61 
million (7·20–8·01) deaths and 105 million (94·3–114·0) 
YLLs estimated in 2017
. Rates of both deaths and YLLs 
from NCD causes decreased over the same time period, 
by 7·9% (7·0–8·8) to 536·1 deaths (528·4–542·2) per 
100 000, with a 9·6% (8·6–10·7) decrease in the YLL rate 
to 11 100 YLLs (10 900–11 300) per 100 000 in 2017
. Total 
deaths from injuries varied little between 2007 and 2017, 
with an increase of 2·3% (0·5–4·0) to 4·48 million 
(4·33–4·59) deaths, while death rates from injury 
decreased by 13·7% (12·2–15·1) to 57·9 deaths 
(55·9–59·2) per 100 000 in 2017
. Decreases in the number 
of YLLs (by 6·4% [4·8–7·8] to 195 million [189–200] YLLs 
in 2017) and YLL rate (by 16·9% [15·3–18·2] to 
2550 [2460–2610] YLLs per 100 000 in 2017) for injuries 
were estimated during the same period.
Communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases
The overall decrease in communicable causes of death 
included reductions in some of the largest contributors to 
global mortality, including HIV
/AIDS, tuberculosis, 
diarrhoeal diseases, and malaria (table 1). The peak in 
HIV
/AIDS mortality occurred in 2006 with 1·95 million 
deaths (95% UI 1·87–2·04) and a rate of 28·8 deaths 
(27·7–30·1) per 100 000, but between 2007 and 2017, total 
mortality from HIV
/AIDS decreased from 1·92 million 
(1·84–2·00) deaths to 0·954 million (0·907–1·01) deaths 
with a commensurate decrease (56·5% [54·7–58·0]) in the 
mortality rate from 27·9 deaths (26·8–29·1) per 100 000 in 
2007 to 12·1 deaths (11·5–12·9) per 100 000 in 2017
. 
Although tuberculosis caused an estimated 1·18 million 
(1·13–1·25) deaths in 2017, this was nonetheless a decrease 
of 14·9% (10·3–18·2) from levels in 2007, when 
tuberculosis caused 1·39 million (1·34–1·46) deaths. Drug-
susceptible tuberculosis deaths were the largest component 
of tuberculosis deaths in 2017 (88·2% [81·4–93·3]) and 
decreased the most since 2007 (15·5% [8·6–22·3]) in 
comparison with other tuberculosis sub-causes. All 
HIV
/AIDS and tuberculosis co-infections also decreased, 
with declines occurring for deaths from HIV
/AIDS and 
drug-resistant tuberculosis co-infection (8·3% [–26·8 to 
14·7]), HIV
/AIDS and multidrug-resistant tuber 
cu 
losis co-
infection (52·2% [33·2–66·4]), and HIV
/AIDS and drug-
susceptible tuberculosis co-infection (55·4% [51·6–58·4]). 
The total number of deaths from diarrhoeal diseases 
decreased by 16·6% (6·7–25·3) between 2007 and 2017, 
from 1·88 million (1·53–2·47) deaths in 2007 to 
1·57 million (1·18–2·19) deaths in 2017
. There was a 
parallel decrease in the death rate (30·2% [22·7–36·1]) 
from diarrhoeal diseases, from 31·0 deaths (25·0–40·9) 
per 100 000 in 2007 to 21·6 deaths (16·4–29·7) per 100 000 
in 2017
. There were 620 000 deaths (440 000–840 000) from 
malaria in 2017, a decrease of 30·8% (20·8–39·4) from 
2007 when 896 000 deaths (664 000–1 180 000) were 
estimated. Deaths due to measles decreased by 57·0% 
(51·9–61·9) from 222 000 deaths (82 300–457 000) in 2007 
to 95 300 (34 500–205 000) in 2017
. Invasive non-typhoidal 
salmonella deaths were estimated to have decreased from 
71 900 deaths (42 200–116 000) in 2007 to 59 100 deaths 
(33 300–98 100) in 2017
. A notable exception to the estimated 
improvements for communicable diseases occurred for 
dengue, where deaths increased by 65·5% (21·7–99·7) 
from 24 500 (11 500–29 600) in 2007 to 40 500 (17 600–49 800) 
in 2017, with a similar increase in mortality rate (40·7% 
[3·6–69·7], from 0·4 deaths [0·2–0·5] per 100 000 in 2007 
to 0·5 deaths [0·2–0·7] per 100 000 in 2017).
At Level 2 of the GBD cause hierarchy, there were 
1·98 million (95% UI 1·89–2·06) deaths from maternal

and neonatal disorders globally in 2017, and 90·2% 
(89·4–90·9) of these deaths were from neonatal 
disorders (table 1). Deaths from neonatal disorders 
decreased by 24·1% (20·6–27·2), from 2·35 million 
(2·27–2·44) deaths in 2007 to 1·78 million (1·70–1·86) in 
2017
. A 26·2% (22·7–29·1) decrease in death rates for 
neonatal disorders was also estimated, from 36·7 deaths 
(35·3–38·0) per 100 000 in 2007 to 27·1 (25·8–28·3) per 
100 000 in 2017
. Deaths from maternal disorders 
decreased by 24·0% (19·5–28·4), from 255 000 deaths 
(241 000–268 000) 
in 
2007 
to 
194 000 
deaths 
(180 000–210 000) in 2017
. The mortality rate for 
maternal disorders decreased by 30·7% (26·6–34·8), 
from 3·6 deaths (3·4–3·8) per 100 000 in 2007 to 2·5 
(2·3–2·7) per 100 000 in 2017
.
There were 270 000 deaths (95% UI 249 000–295 000) 
from nutritional deficiencies in 2017, representing 
2·60% (2·37–2·86) of all deaths from CMNN causes in 
that year (table 1). Decreases in death rates from 
nutritional deficiencies followed a trajectory similar to 
that of maternal and neonatal disorders, with mortality 
rates from nutritional deficiencies decreasing by 33·6% 
(26·5–38·1), from 5·8 deaths (5·4–6·2) per 100 000 in 
2007 to 3·8 (3·5–4·2) per 100 000 in 2017
.
Non-communicable diseases
At Level 2 of the GBD hierarchy, the largest numbers of 
deaths from NCDs were estimated for cardiovascular 
diseases (17·8 million [95% UI 17·5–18·0] deaths), 
followed by neoplasms (9·56 million [9·40–9·69] deaths) 
and chronic respiratory diseases (3·91 million [3·79–4·04] 
deaths; table 1). Overall, deaths from NCDs increased 
globally, from 33·5 million (33·1–33·8) in 2007 to 
41·1 million (40·5–41·5) in 2017, while the death rate 
decreased (from 582·1 deaths [575·1–587·8] per 100 000 
in 2007 to 536·1 deaths [528·4–542·2] per 100 000 in 
2017). Total deaths from NCDs decreased significantly for 
only two Level 3 causes: sudden infant death syndrome 
(17·3% [1·4–28·6]) and congenital anomalies (14·3% 
[10·1–21·1]). During the past decade the estimated 
number of deaths from neurological disorders increased 
by 42·1% (40·2–43·9), from 2·18 million (2·14–2·20) 
deaths in 2007 to 3·09 million (3·04–3·14) deaths in 
2017; although the death rate increased, this change was 
not significant (0·1% [–1·2 to 1·3], from 43·0 deaths 
[42·3–43·4] per 100 000 in 2007 to 43·1 deaths [42·3–43·7] 
per 100 000 in 2017). Among neurological disorders, the 
greatest increase between 2007 and 2017 occurred for 
deaths from Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias 
(an increase of 46·2% [43·9–48·0], from 1·72 million 
[1·70–1·74] deaths in 2007 to 2·51 million [2·47–2·55] in 
2017; and from 35·2 deaths [34·7–35·5] per 100 000 in 
2007 to 35·4 [34·8–35·9] per 100 000 in 2017). 
At a global level, total deaths from cardiovascular diseases 
increased by 21·1% (95% UI 19·7–22·6) between 2007 and 
2017 but death rates decreased from 259·9 deaths 
(257·1–263·7) per 100 000 in 2007 to 233·1 (229·7–236·4) 
per 100 000 in 2017 (table 1). In combination, ischaemic 
heart disease and stroke—at Level 3 of the cause hier-
archy—accounted for 84·9% (84·3–86·3) of cardio 
vascular 
disease deaths in 2017
. Deaths from both these causes 
increased between 2007 and 2017, from 7·30 million 
(7·22–7·46) deaths to 8·93 million (8·79–9·14) deaths for 
ischaemic heart disease, and from 5·29 million (5·22–5·40) 
deaths to 6·17 million (6·04–6·33) deaths for stroke. The 
largest decline in mortality rates among cardiovascular 
diseases during the same decade occurred for rheumatic 
heart disease, which decreased by 21·3% (17·8–25·2) 
between 2007 and 2017, from 4·7 deaths (4·4–5·0) per 
100 000 to 3·7 deaths (3·4–3·9) per 100 000.
Neoplasms contributed to 23·3% (95% UI 23·0–23·5) of 
deaths from NCDs in 2017, with tracheal, bronchus, and 
lung cancer leading to the most deaths (1·88 million 
[1·84–1·92]), followed by colon and rectum cancer (896 000 
[876 000–916 000]; table 1). Newly estimated for GBD 2017, 
liver cancer due to NASH caused 66 900 deaths 
(59 600–74 500) in 2017, representing an increase of 42·3% 
(38·0–47·6) from 2007
. Globally, deaths from cancers 
increased by 25·4% (23·9–27·0) between 2007 and 2017, 
from 7·62 million (7·51–7·70) deaths in 2007 to 
9·56 million (9·40–9·69) deaths in 2017
. The largest 
increases occurred for other neoplasms, which includes 
myelodysplastic, myeloproliferative, and other haemo-
poietic neoplasms, benign and in-situ intestinal, cervical, 
and uterine neoplasms, and other benign and in-situ 
neoplasms (increase of 42·0% [35·6–51·7] to 103 000 deaths 
[80 200–122 000]), other pharynx cancer (increase of 40·4% 
[29·7–48·4] to 117 000 deaths [102 000–124 000]), and 
pancreatic cancer (increase of 39·9% [36·7–42·6] to 
441 000 deaths [433 000–449 000]). Mortality rates for most 
types of cancer decreased in the decade 2007–17; the largest 
statistically significant decreases occurred for stomach 
cancer (decrease of 17·1% [15·1–18·8] to 11·0 deaths 
[10·8–11·2] per 100 000), Hodgkin lymphoma (decrease of 
16·8% [14·0–19·8] to 0·4 deaths [0·4–0·5] per 100 000), 
and oesophageal cancer (decrease of 14·5% [12·0–16·9] to 
5·5 deaths [5·3–5·6] per 100 000).
Several non-communicable causes were separately 
estimated for the first time in GBD 2017
. Among these, 
diabetes mellitus resulted in 1·37 million (95% UI 
1·34–1·40) deaths in 2017, of which 25·2% (23·0–27·3) 
were from type 1 diabetes (table 1). Total deaths from 
type 1 diabetes increased from 2007 to 2017 by 15·1% 
(10·5–19·0) and those from type 2 diabetes by 43·0% 
(40·4–45·8). During this time period, the mortality rate 
decreased by 11·0% (7·8–14·6) for type 1 diabetes and 
increased by 5·9% (4·1–8·0) for type 2 diabetes. Deaths 
from diabetes-related chronic kidney disease also 
increased over the past decade, rising from 62 800 deaths 
(51 100–76 200) in 2007 to 77 300 deaths (62 400–95 200) 
in 2017 for chronic kidney disease due to type 1 diabetes 
and from 248 000 deaths (219 000–282 000) in 2007 to 
349 000 (307 000–396 000) in 2017 for chronic kidney 
disease due to type 2 diabetes. Among other newly

estimated causes, subarachnoid haemorrhage was 
estimated to have caused 445 000 deaths (417 000–492 000) 
in 2017, representing 0·8% (0·7–0·9) of global deaths 
and 2·5% (2·3–2·8) of cardiovascular disease deaths in 
2017; deaths from non-rheumatic valvular heart disease 
(145 000 [122 000–150 000]) represented 0·3% (0·2–0·3) 
of global deaths and 0·8% (0·7–0·9) of cardiovascular 
disease deaths in 2017
. Deaths from substance use 
disorders increased between 2007 and 2017, rising 
from 284 000 deaths (268 000–289 000) to 352 000 deaths 
(334 000–363 000) globally; although not statistically 
significant, the death rate for these disorders increased 
by 2·0% (–1·0 to 5·0) during this period, rising from 
4·3 deaths (4·0 to 4·3) per 100 000 to 4·3 (4·1 to 4·5) per 
100 000 (table 1). The great 
est number of deaths from 
drug use disorders were due to opioid use disorders, 
which resulted in 110 000 deaths (106 000–114 000) 
globally in 2017, comprising 65·7% (63·8–67·4) of global 
deaths from drug use disorders.
Injuries
At Level 3 of the cause hierarchy, most injury deaths 
were from road injuries, which caused 1·24 million 
(95% UI 1·19–1·28) deaths in 2017, representing 27·7% 
(26·7–28·9) of all injury deaths in that year (table 1). 
794 000 deaths (744 000–820 000) in 2017 were from self-
harm, followed by 696 000 deaths (645 000–742 000) from 
falls, 405 000  deaths (365 000–432 000) from interpersonal 
violence, and 295 000 deaths (285 000–306 000) from 
drowning. Mortality rates in 2017 were highest among 
injury causes of death at Level 3 of the GBD hierarchy for 
road injuries (15·8 deaths [15·2–16·3] per 100 000), self-
harm (10·0 deaths [9·4–10·3] per 100 000), and falls 
(9·2 deaths [8·5–9·8] per 100 000). Overall, from 2007 to 
2017, there were 20·1 million (18·7–20·8) deaths from 
unintentional injuries, 15·1 million (14·8–15·4) deaths 
from transport injuries, and 14·4 million (13·7–14·7) 
deaths from self-harm and interpersonal violence. 
Poisoning by carbon monoxide, estimated for the first 
time for GBD 2017, caused 35 500 deaths (25 700–38 800) 
in 2017
.
Since 1980, sudden changes in the expected number of 
deaths—described as fatal discontinuities in the GBD 
study—were found in several countries (figure 3). To 
emphasise the magnitude of these events, we describe 
total deaths rather than rates in this report. Figure 3 
combines total deaths across disparate types of fatal 
discontinuity; appendix 2 separates these deaths by

Figure 3: All-age deaths due to fatal discontinuities (violence, disasters, famine, and disease outbreak),  for both sexes combined, 1980–2017
We have chosen to show this map in counts to capture the wide range of discontinuity‐related deaths ranging from motor vehicle accidents with a smaller number of deaths to natural disasters and 
conflicts with a larger number of deaths. Deaths are coded to the location of residence for the deceased. Maps by each subtype—violence, disasters, famine, and disease outbreak—are provided in 
appendix 2. ATG=Antigua and Barbuda. FSM=Federated States of Micronesia. Isl=Islands. LCA=Saint Lucia. TLS=Timor‐Leste. TTO=Trinidad and Tobago. VCT=Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.

category. Deaths from conflict and terrorism, despite 
substantial limitations to their enumeration, were 
estimated to have increased greatly, rising by 118·0% 
(95% UI 88·8–148·6) in 2007–17 (table 1). Of deaths 
related to conflict and terrorism, 16 200 (13 400–19 800) 
were among people aged 5–14 years and 14 300 
(11 700–17 300) occurred for children younger than 5 years; 
combined, these deaths represented 23·5% (20·5–26·9) 
of all deaths from conflict and terrorism (table 2).
Age-specific and sex-specific mortality for causes of 
death
Progress in reducing deaths was not equal between age 
groups (table 2). Total deaths from lower respiratory 
infections decreased by 36·4% (95% UI 32·2–40·6) 
between 2007 and 2017 for children younger than 
5 years, while an increase of 33·6% (31·2–36·1) was 
estimated among older adults (≥70 years). A parallel 
pattern occurred for deaths from diarrhoeal diseases 
between 2007 and 2017, which decreased by 40·6% 
(32·2–47·8) for children younger than 5 years, and 
increased by 15·0% (4·5–31·1) for adults older than 
70 years.
Decreases among aetiologies of infection over 
the wider time period 1990–2017 included decreases 
in deaths from pneumococcal pneumonia (71·2% 
[95% UI 67·1–75·1]), respiratory syncytial virus pneu-
monia 
(64·2% 
[59·4–68·2]), 
influenza 
(66·0% 
[61·6–69·9]), and H influenzae type B pneumonia 
(82·5% [80·0–85·2]) for children younger than 5 years 
(appendix 2). Among adults older than 70 years, deaths 
increased from pneumococcal pneumonia (60·4% 
[39·7–79·9]), 
influenza 
(91·1% 
[82·3–99·6]), 
and 
respiratory 
syncytial 
virus 
pneumonia 
(100·3% 
[92·4–108·6]) between 1990 and 2017
. Diarrhoeal deaths 
due to C difficile increased among adults older than 
70 years (779·9% [736·7–831·0]), and for diarrhoeal 
diseases overall (44·0% [24·7–84·6]); by contrast,

diarrhoeal disease deaths declined by 67·9% (61·1–73·1) 
between 1990 and 2017 for children younger than 5 years.
At a global scale, total deaths were greater for men than 
for women at most ages in 2017; exceptions included 
ages 80–84 years (women, 3·30 million [95% UI 
3·26–3·35] deaths; men, 3·14 million [3·10–3·18] 
deaths), 85–89 years (women, 3·02 million [2·99–3·05] 
deaths; 
men, 
2·29 
million 
[2·27–2·32] 
deaths), 
90–94 years (women, 1·94 million [1·92–1·96] deaths; 
men, 1·09 million [1·09–1·10] deaths), and 95 years 
and older (women, 858 000 deaths [852 000–864 000]; 
men, 329 000 deaths [327 000–331 000]; figure 4). Across 
causes, the largest female-to-male ratio of deaths 
occurred for neurological disorders (women ≥85 years, 
1·05 million [1·04–1·07] deaths; men ≥85 years, 
475 000 deaths [464 000–483 000]) and for cardiovascular 
diseases (women ≥85 years, 2·65 million [2·61–2·69] 
deaths; men ≥85 years, 1·56 million [1·53–1·58] deaths). 
Overall, deaths from injury were also greater for men 
than for women (3·07 million [2·95–3·14] vs 1·42 million 
[1·36–1·46]) and in each five-year age group up to age 
85 years (122 000 deaths [112 000–128 000] for men aged 
≥85 years vs 173 000 deaths [166 000–181 000] for women 
aged ≥85 years).
Patterns in rates of change in global cause-specific 
mortality rate
To better understand recent changes across a wide range 
of causes, we present the distribution of the percentage 
change in mortality rate at the country level by 
Level 1 causes and over three time periods (2003–07, 
2008–12, and 2013–17; figure 5A, 5B, 5C). At Level 1 of the 
GBD cause hierarchy, a decrease in the global percentage 
change in CSMR was evident between time periods, 
particularly for NCDs, although this varied by SDI 
quintile. Globally, the percentage change in mortality

rate for NCDs was smaller in the most recent period, 
slowing from a decrease of 7·8% (95% UI 7·5–8·2) over 
the 2003–07 period to a decrease of 2·1% (1·5–2·7) for 
2013–17
. For CMNN causes, the largest decrease in 
percentage change occurred at high SDI quintiles, from 
a decrease of 8·8% (8·1–9·4) for 2003–07 to a decrease of 
3·0% (1·7–4·2) for 2013–17
. Increases in the magnitude 
of the percentage change between 2003–07 and 2013–17 
for CMNN causes were estim 
ated at low SDI quintiles 
(from a decrease of 12·9% [11·6–14·1] for 2003–07 to a 
decrease of 13·9% [12·1–15·5] for 2013–17), low-middle 
SDI quintiles (from a decrease of 11·2% [9·8–12·6] for 
2003–07 to a decrease of 13·5% [11·4–15·5] for 2013–17), 
and middle SDI quintiles (from a decrease of 11·8% 
[10·8–12·8] for 2003–07 to a decrease of 15·6% 
[14·3–16·7] for 2013–17; figure 5A). For NCDs, the largest 
decrease in percen 
tage change was for high-middle SDI 
quintiles, from 11·5% (10·8–12·2) in 2003–07 to 4·5% 
(3·2–5·7) in 2013–17 (figure 5B). Across injury causes of 
death, the largest decrease in the magnitude of change 
occurred at high-middle SDI quintiles (from a decrease 
of 16·1% [15·2–16·9] for 2003–07 to a decrease of 7·0% 
[5·5–8·3] for 2013–17), while an increase in magnitude 
was estimated at low-middle SDI quintiles (from a 
decrease of 2·1% [0·7–3·6] for 2003–07 to a decrease of 
6·3% [4·0–8·6] for 2013–17; figure 5C).
Epidemiological transitions
The five leading causes of YLLs at Level 2 of the GBD cause 
hierarchy, together with injuries, by SDI level are shown in 
figure 6A. The greatest total YLLs for enteric infections in 
2017 were at low SDI (42·6 million [95% UI 37·1–50·5] 
YLLs) and low-middle SDI quintiles (33·4 million 
[28·4–40·3] YLLs), but with a large decrease from 1990, 
when YLLs were 83·2 million (69·6–95·8) in low SDI 
countries and 76·9 million (63·9–89·4) in low-middle SDI 
countries; changes in respiratory infections and tubercu-
losis followed a similar pattern. Similarly, YLLs from 
maternal and neonatal disorders remained high for both 
low SDI and low-middle SDI countries, despite a large 
decrease in total YLLs from 87·5 million (76·0–103·0) in 
1980 to 71·1 million (66·9–75·5) in 2017 for low SDI 
countries and from 98·0 million (89·2–108·0) in 1980 to 
67·3 million (62·3–72·4) in 2017 for low-middle SDI 
countries. The impact of premature death due to 
neoplasms has risen across SDI levels but with the largest 
increases in low-middle SDI countries (15·1 million 
[13·6–17·3] YLLs in 1980 vs 35·0 million [33·4–36·8] YLLs 
in 2017) and middle SDI countries (30·6 million 
[28·9–33·5] YLLs in 1980 vs 62·0 million [60·1–63·8] YLLs 
in 2017). YLLs from cardiovascular diseases increased at all 
SDI levels with the exception of high SDI countries, where 
total YLLs fell from 60·6 million (60·2–61·0) in 1980 to 
41·4 million (40·8–42·2) in 2017
. Total YLLs from injuries 
(self-harm and interpersonal violence, transport injuries, 
and unintentional injuries) at certain time periods 
exceeded those from the global leading causes of death; 
from 1980 to 2017 this increase occurred most often at 
lower SDI levels, and even with YLL rates slowly decreasing 
during this time period. Low SDI countries had a decrease 
in the rate of YLLs due to self-harm, falling from 604·4 
(499·7–712·0) per 100 000 in 1980 to 441·4 (410·9–479·2) 
per 100 000 in 2017, but still remained higher than in all 
other SDI quintiles. In general, the precision of estimates 
was lower at lower SDI levels, represented by the wider 
95% UIs across causes, which reflects the availability of 
data for these locations.
Despite increasing populations and changes in 
population age-structure, YLL rates decreased across the 
five leading Level 2 GBD causes of YLLs in all SDI 
quintiles (figure 6B). Large decreases in YLL rates were 
estimated at low SDI levels for respiratory infections and 
tuberculosis (from 14 900 [95% UI 13 000–16 600] YLLs per 
100 000 in 1980 to 4750 [4505–4990] YLLs per 100 000 in 
2017). Rates for enteric infections also decreased rapidly 
at low SDI levels (from 12 600 [9990–15 300] YLLs per 
100 000 in 1980 to 3180 [2670–4090] YLLs per 100 000 in 
2017) and low-middle SDI levels (9310 [7640–11 300] YLLs 
per 100 000 in 1980 to 2020 [1670–2500] YLLs per 100 000 in 
2017). The YLL rate also decreased for cardiovascular 
diseases and for neoplasms across all SDI levels despite 
increases in the total number of YLLs. YLL rates for 
cervical cancer at low SDI levels—a cancer of infectious 
aetiology—decreased from 317 (242–373) YLLs per 
100 000 to 191 (173–211) YLLs per 100 000 (appendix 2). At 
the same time, cancers such as pancreatic cancer—driven 
substantially by non-infectious risks—increased at low 
SDI levels from 38·6 (31·2–50·0) YLLs per 100 000 to 
55·9 (51·9–60·0) YLLs per 100 000 (appendix 2).
Leading causes of global YLLs
Figure 7 shows the ongoing epidemiological shift in 
leading causes of total YLLs from CMNN diseases to NCDs 
at Level 3 of the GBD cause hierarchy over the 1990–2007 
period and for 2007–17
. Globally, the leading causes of YLLs 
in 1990 were neonatal disorders (ranked first), lower 
respiratory infections (second), and diarrhoeal diseases 
(third). Estimated YLLs decreased by 21·2% (95% UI 
16·6–25·8) for neonatal disorders, by 38·6% (34·3–42·0) 
for lower respiratory infections, and by 39·5% (32·6– 45·4) 
for diarrhoeal diseases, from 1990 to 2007, and by a further 
24·1% (20·6–27·2), 25·9% (22·2–29·2), and 32·0% 
(23·9–38·6), from 2007 to 2017
. YLL rates also decreased 
during the entire 1990–2017 time period for neonatal 
disorders (from 4059·1 [3802·1–4336·0] YLLs per 100 000 
to 2377·2 [2263·7–2485·1] YLLs per 100 000), lower respira-
tory infections (from 3821·4 [3509·9–4093·3] YLLs 
per 100 000 to 1515·1 [1424·8–1602·2] YLLs per 100 000), 
and diarrhoeal diseases (from 2843·6 [2415·0–3280·8] 
YLLs per 100 000 to 1009·1 [870·5–1211·0] YLLs per 
100 000). In 2017, neonatal disorders were ranked second, 
lower respiratory infections fourth, and diarrhoeal diseases 
fifth in terms of total YLLs. Estimated YLLs from ischaemic 
heart disease, ranked first, increased by 20·9% (19·0–22·9)

(B) Non‐communicable diseases. (C) Injuries. The figure shows the distribution of 
the percentage change in the age‐standardised mortality rate by Level 1 cause over 
the three 5‐year periods (2003–07, 2008–12, and 2013–17). The colours represent 
SDI quintiles. The solid line represents no change in the age‐standardised mortality 
rate during the specified 5‐year period. The dotted line represents the median over 
all countries in the percentage change. Countries that were outliers (>30% decrease 
or a 10% increase in a given time period) were removed from the figure in order to 
better distinguish the shape of the distribution. For communicable, maternal, 
neonatal, and nutritional diseases, the following countries were excluded: Finland, 
Georgia, Lithuania, Rwanda, Serbia, South Africa, Turkey, and Ukraine in 2003–07; 
Botswana, Croatia, Dominica, Malawi, Namibia, Zambia, and Zimbabwe in 
2008–12; and Botswana, Lesotho, South Africa, and Swaziland in 2013–17. For 
injuries, the following were excluded: Afghanistan, Burundi, Cape Verde, Comoros, 
Georgia, Iran, Iraq, Jamaica, Liberia, São Tomé and Príncipe, Spain, and Trinidad and 
Tobago in 2003–07; El Salvador, Honduras, Israel, Libya, Mexico, Myanmar, 
Palestine, Samoa, South Sudan, Sri Lanka, Syria, and Ukraine in 2008–12; and

from 1990 to 2007, and by a further 17·3% (15·4–19·0) 
from 2007 to 2017, while estimated YLLs from stroke, 
ranked third, increased by 12·9% (10·6–15·2) from 1990 to 
2007, and by a further 12·1% (9·9–14·1) from 2007 to 2017
. 
However, decreases in YLL rates were estimated for 
ischaemic heart disease between 1990 and 2007 (20·2% 
[19·0–21·4]), and from 2007 to 2017 (9·8% [8·5–11·2]). YLL 
rates for stroke decreased by 24·0% (22·5–25·4) from 1990 
to 2007, and by 13·8% (12·3–15·5) from 2007 to 2017
. Other 
leading NCD causes of YLLs in 2017 included congenital 
anomalies (ranked ninth), and chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (seventh); other leading CMNN causes 
included lower respiratory infections (fourth), diarrhoeal 
diseases (fifth), HIV
/AIDS (eighth), and malaria (tenth). 
The only injury cause of death in the leading ten causes of 
YLLs in 2017 was road injuries, for which the YLL rate 
decreased by 18·4% (14·4–22·0) from 1990 to 2007, with a 
further decrease of 19·6% (17·5–21·6) from 2007 to 2017, 
but with an increase in relative rank as a source of total 
YLLs from eighth in 1990 to sixth in 2017
.
YLLs and Socio-demographic Index level
The association between SDI level and YLL rates for 
each GBD region for each year between 1990 and 2017 is 
illustrated for CMNN causes, NCDs, and injuries in 
figure 8. In general, YLL rates decreased as SDI for a 
given region increased, with some exceptions. Among 
these, the YLL rate in southern sub-Saharan Africa was 
distinctly non-linear, increasing across CMNN causes 
even as SDI level increased before decreasing by a 
similar amount against a backdrop of rising SDI level. 
Southern sub-Saharan Africa achieved a higher SDI 
level than did other regions of sub-Saharan Africa, 
although not necessarily consistently lower YLL rates 
for CMNN causes than the other regions of sub-Saharan 
Africa. Variation in the association between YLL rate for 
NCDs and SDI in the regions of central Asia and eastern 
Europe was observed, with the highest YLL rate observed 
in 2005 for central Asia, and in 1994 for eastern Europe. 
An end to previous declines in the YLL rate for NCDs at 
highest SDI (in the most recent years) was observed for 
high-income North America and Australasia. The 
impact of fatal discontinuities can be seen in the large 
spikes in YLL rates estimated in eastern sub-Saharan 
Africa in 1994, reflecting mortality from the genocide in 
Rwanda, and in the Caribbean region where the 2010 
earthquake in Haiti resulted in a YLL rate 2·5 times 
greater than the level expected in that year given the 
SDI level.
Decomposition of driving factors in epidemiological 
change for selected causes
Changes in mortality are driven by population growth, 
population ageing, and changes in CSMR. The relative 
contributions of these factors to the change in total 
mortality for the 20 leading Level 2 causes of mortality 
from 2007 to 2017 are shown in figure 9. Population 
growth was an important contributor to increased levels 
of mortality across all causes. Declines in CSMR 
counterbalanced this effect for all but three causes—
substance use disorders, neurological disorders, and 
skin and subcutaneous diseases. Without these de-
creases in CSMR, population ageing and growth would 
have resulted in increased mortality for most causes. 
Although population ageing led to increases in total 
deaths for most leading causes, for some causes—
particularly neonatal conditions or other causes that 
primarily affect children—population ageing con-
tributed to reductions for maternal and neonatal dis-
orders (13·0%), neglected tropical diseases and malaria 
(3·9%), other infectious diseases (3·3%), other NCDs 
(1·6%), and nutritional deficiencies (1·3%). Changes in 
CSMR contributed the largest fraction to estimated 
changes in total deaths for 12 leading causes. CSMR 
contributed to 66·5% of the decrease in deaths from 
HIV/AIDS and to 8·1% of the increase in substance use 
disorders.
Discussion
High-level conclusions from the new health estimates 
of GBD 2017
General trends
The results of GBD 2017 show that, globally, CMNN 
diseases have declined steadily since 1990 in terms of 
total numbers of deaths and death rates. Global malaria 
deaths peaked in 2004 and HIV
/AIDS-related deaths 
peaked in 2006, reflecting investments in the delivery of 
antiretroviral therapies, insecticide-treated bednets, and 
other interventions. NCDs, including both cardiovascular 
diseases and cancers, have risen steadily since 1990 in 
terms of total number of deaths, driven by ageing and 
population growth, while death rates have decreased, 
more slowly in the most recent years, as a result of 
improvements in prevention strategies and health-care

Causes are connected by lines between time periods; solid lines are increases and dashed lines are decreases. For the time period 1990–2007 and for 2007–17, three measures of change are shown: 
percentage change in the number of YLLs, percentage change in the all‐age YLL rate, and percentage change in the age‐standardised YLL rate. Communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases 
are shown in red, non‐communicable causes in blue, and injuries in green. Statistically significant changes are shown in bold. COPD=chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. YLLs=years of life lost.

interventions. Injury-related death rates have continued 
to decline since 1990.
Diseases of obesity
Our results show that a large number of deaths are known 
to be caused by high body-mass index, including cardio-
vascular diseases, neoplasms, dementia, asthma, hepato-
biliary diseases, as well as diabetes and kidney diseases.23 
The prevalence of obesity continues to rise in almost 
every country in the world, with more than 1 million 
deaths estimated as being due to type 2 diabetes, half a 
million deaths due to diabetes-related chronic kidney 
disease, and 180 000 due to NASH-related liver cancer 
and cirrhosis in this analysis.24 NASH is most often due to 
chronic insulin resistance secondary to obesity and might 
be present among 10–35% of the global adult population.25 
The increasing prevalence of obesity might explain 
why death rates for cardiovascular disease are no 
longer declining in Australia, Austria, Brazil, Germany, 
Netherlands, the UK, and the USA.26  There is concern 
that global rates of ischaemic heart disease and ischaemic 
stroke might begin to rise for the first time since the 
1970s.27 Increasing obesity could be the result of increased 
national wealth leading to complex changes in food 
systems, food quality, nutrition, technology, and levels of 
physical activity.28 Adult obesity has been identified as a 
key challenge to global nutrition, in particular for 
locations where malnutrition and obesity co-occur.29 
Evidence-based nutrition policies should address this 
double burden, including in countries where obesity 
prevalence is low but estimated to be increasing.24 At the 
same time, cost-effective therapies that lower elevated 
blood pressure, cholesterol, and glucose, and reductions 
in tobacco smoking will remain important interventions.
Lower respiratory and enteric infections
Given the UN General Assembly High-level Meeting on 
tuberculosis in September, 2018, it is notable that total 
deaths due to tuberculosis have decreased since 2007, 
falling most rapidly for children younger than 5 years, but 
also that the majority of tuberculosis deaths were due to 
drug-susceptible tuberculosis (88·2% [95% UI 81·4–93·3]

of total tuberculosis deaths in 2017). Deaths due to other 
lower respiratory infections remain a greater concern for 
children younger than 5 years due to a mortality rate more 
than ten times higher than that of tuberculosis.
Pneumococcal pneumonia was estimated to be the 
leading cause of death due to LRI in 2017 for children 
younger than 5 years, followed by respiratory syncytial 
virus pneumonia, H influenzae type B pneumonia, and 
influenza (appendix 2). Although the GBD counter 
factual 
methodology for causes of death does smooth over some 
epidemics, our results show that over the past 27 years, 
mortality due to influenza and pneumococcal pneumonia 
has decreased but not at the same rate, reflecting differences 
in the age patterns and vaccination trends during this time 
period.30 Declines in other vaccine-preventable causes of 
child mortality, such as measles, suggest that achievements 
are possible over short periods of time.
Reductions in deaths due to pneumonia between 1990 
and 2017 have been far larger for children than for older 
adults, with death rates due to pneumococcal pneumonia 
in adults older than 70 years having fallen by less than 
half as much as those of children, while death rates due 
to influenza and respiratory syncytial virus pneumonia 
have changed only minimally (appendix 2). 
Similar patterns are seen for deaths due to enteric 
infections. Deaths related to C difficile increased among 
older adults, with only moderate declines in deaths due to 
other infectious causes of diarrhoea, while diarrhoeal 
deaths for children younger than 5 years continued to 
decline. The epidemic of C difficile might reflect increased 
incidence and pathogenicity of this bacterium, due to 
changing patterns of antibiotic resistance, comorbidity, 
and susceptibility among an ageing adult population.31 The 
age pattern for deaths due to multiple infectious diseases 
reflects investments in interventions that reduce childhood 
mortality as well as the challenges of delivering more 
complex health interventions to older adults with comorbid 
conditions. Evidence-based health policies will need to 
consider whether large increases in the use of antibiotics32 
are leading to meaningful reductions in adult infections.33
The geography of conflict
Conflict-related deaths represent the fastest growing cause 
of injury-related deaths. Since 2007, conflicts have resulted 
in 1·14 million deaths, concentrated in the North Africa 
and Middle East region.34 Parts of South Asia, sub-
Saharan Africa, and Latin America are also ex 
periencing 
increasing rates of conflict-related deaths since 2007
. 
Childhood deaths due to conflict were dis 
proportionate. 
Regions with ongoing conflict are likely to face recurring 
health emergencies and present a particular challenge for 
achieving global development targets.35 Regional efforts to 
promote public health in areas with ongoing conflict, such 
as the recently established Africa Centres for Disease 
Control and Prevention,36 might help to support 
surveillance and implementation of evidence-based health 
policies in these often dire situations.
Countervailing patterns
The identification of exceptions to any large-scale patterns 
is an important result of GBD 2017
. There are notable 
exceptions to the overall pattern of increasing total deaths 
from NCDs. For example, the total number of deaths from 
various congenital anomalies, including neural tube 
defects, congenital heart anomalies, and orofacial clefts 
decreased during the past decade. Some of the decline 
in neural tube defects and orofacial clefts could be related 
to improved nutritional status of women and more 
widespread introduction of folic acid fort 
ification 
programmes, and some reductions might also be related 
to improvements in prenatal screening, access to abortion, 
supportive and interventional care services for infants 
born with birth defects, and broader reductions in 
infectious diseases to which such infants are especially 
susceptible.37 Conversely, for selected causes, both the 
number of deaths and death rate are increasing, including 
opioid, cocaine, amphetamine, and other drug use dis-
orders, and liver cancers due to hepatitis B and hepatitis C. 
Inadequate access to treatment for hepatitis C, and 
restricted implementation of risk-prevention and treat-
ment strategies for addiction and substance abuse might 
explain, in part, why death rates due to these preventable 
diseases are increasing.38 The total number of fall-related 
deaths has also risen steadily with no decline in rates, 
reflecting the way in which population ageing might be 
having a differential effect on injury-related deaths.
Public health significance
Recent plateaus in mortality rates
The results of GBD 2017 show that declines in death 
rates of some common diseases are slowing or have 
ceased, primarily for NCDs. Declines in cardiovascular 
disease and neoplasms are slowing for many high-
income countries. This observation is clearest for 
estimates at the subnational level, where deaths from 
these causes are increasing for some states in the USA 
and local authorities in the UK. Medications that lower 
blood pressure and blood cholesterol, and therefore the 
risk of atherosclerotic vascular disease events and deaths, 
are among the most cost-effective interventions available 
to health systems but are not being delivered effectively. 
 Global Health Metrics
1770 
www.thelancet.com   Vol 392   November 10, 2018
Increasing evidence of a plateau in the decline, or even 
increases, in atherosclerotic vascular diseases should 
drive investment towards innovative systems that can 
effectively deliver these medications as well as public 
health measures and behaviour changes that need to 
accompany them.39 Plateaus in mortality are not restricted 
to high-income countries and can also be seen for leading 
causes in low-income countries. Decreases in the death 
rate of malaria have slowed for many regions, perhaps 
related to a period of slowing in the decline in incident 
infections observed in many regions between 2011 and 
2013. Improved malaria mortality surveillance will be 
required to understand these most recent patterns.
Beyond the leading causes of death
Some common causes of death receive relatively less 
attention from the global community, because of their 
position as second or lower-ranked causes within a 
larger category. These highly ranked but non-leading 
causes include stomach cancer, asthma, syphilis, chronic 
kidney disease, congenital heart disease, and rheumatic 
heart disease. These causes combined resulted in more 
than 3 million deaths in 2017
. Deaths due to these causes 
are at least partially amenable to primary or secondary 
pre 
vention strategies, suggesting that improvements 
in the continuum of care, including in food quality, 
sanitation, diagnosis and screening, ongoing case 
management, and increased access to essential 
medicines via expanded universal health coverage, will 
have an important role in their reduction.40 GBD 2017 
added several important but less heralded causes of 
death, including liver cancer due to NASH, subarachnoid 
haemorrhage, and non-rheumatic valvular heart dis-
eases. These diseases sometimes do not have the more 
easily addressed risk exposures associated with the 
leading causes of death such as LRI, HIV/AIDS, lung 
cancer, or ischaemic heart disease, or they might be 
prevalent in locations where medical technologies or 
effective health-care interventions are less widely 
available. Diseases ranked lower within a larger cause 
category also might not benefit from the large-scale, 
focused advocacy efforts for the leading causes of death 
yet represent important future targets for research and 
public health. A rational, disease-burden-based approach 
to priority setting for health policy, now being adopted in 
some countries,41 might help to accelerate the scale-up of 
interven 
tions that will have the largest impact on 
disability and pre 
mature death.
Emerging diseases and disorders due to antibiotic and opioid use
Although GBD provides estimates starting in the year 
1980, changes in the most recent years are of particular 
importance for governments working to improve 
re 
sponsive 
ness to emerging threats to human health.

Since 2007, rapid increases in death rates have been 
observed for a small number of diseases and disorders, 
including dengue, extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis, 
cellu 
litis, C difficile diarrhoea, and opioid, cocaine, and 
amphetamine use disorders. Of the infectious causes 
(other than dengue, the increase of which might reflect 
changes in the range of its primary vector, Aedes aegypti), 
increased patho 
genicity due to antibiotic use or resis 
tance 
is likely to be a major factor. Rapid increases in opioid-
related deaths, particularly in the USA and Canada42 
but also in other high SDI locations,43 have been attributed 
in part to wider availability of high-potency opioid 
analgesics44 and to international illegal trade of synthetic 
opioids.45
These emerging causes are associated with wider use 
of pharmaceuticals. The global health armamentarium 
will need to expand beyond its traditional approach of 
increasing access to treatment to include antimicrobial 
stewardship46 and programmes to manage the use of 
synthetic opioids. Policy makers will need particular 
expertise to balance these initiatives with equally vocal 
calls to address sepsis47 and cancer pain48,49 as global 
health priorities.
Epidemiological transition for injuries and cancer
The epidemiological transition is most commonly 
thought of as a decline in CMNN deaths and a rise in 
chronic NCDs. GBD 2017 shows that deaths due to 
injuries and cancers also undergo characteristic 
transitions. Although specific locations have substantial 
spikes in injury-related mortality during natural disasters 
or conflicts, the mortality rates from specific injuries 
can vary as a function of development along the SDI 
spectrum. Road injuries, for example, might initially 
increase early in development when more of the 
population has exposure to transport-related injuries. As 
development increases, however, it becomes increasingly 
important for countries to invest in specific resources 
that can protect against mortality from these injuries, 
such as advanced trauma care, emergency medical 
response, vehicle safety initiatives such as seatbelt laws, 
and interventions to reduce distractions while driving.50
By contrast, other injuries such as falls and self-harm 
might more reliably decline as SDI increases and access 
to medical care improves. For example, deaths related to 
self-harm have declined drastically throughout China, 
possibly because of improved economic prospects among 
the poorest individuals and decreased access to lethal 
pesticides.51 There are also exceptions where deaths 
related to self-harm are not declining, including Australia, 
Brazil, the Philippines, Turkey, and the USA. Further 
research is needed to fully examine the underlying factors 
driving these divergent trends.
The epidemiological transition can also be observed 
among the different types of cancer. In many countries 
with lower SDI, cancers of infectious aetiology52 or related 
to poor nutrition are decreasing, whereas cancers typically 
associated with obesity and alcohol consumption are 
becoming more common. The concept that future 
demands on health systems might be, at least in part, 
predictable is an attractive feature of the theory of 
epidemiological transition that merits further exploration, 
such as recent work to produce health forecasts using 
results of the GBD study and projections of SDI.53
Continuous quality improvement
GBD 2017 has developed new methods to address the 
observation that some common causes of death are 
reported by surveillance systems as having implausible 
trends across time and varying widely between coun-
tries.54,55 This concern has been noted for dementia and 
Parkinson’s disease, where there has been a rapid rise in 
reported deaths attributed to these causes despite stable 
incidence and case fatality in most epidemiological 
studies.56–60 A new analysis by GBD 2017 uses 35 years of 
person-level underlying and intermediate cause of death 
data from the USA—a database of 80·4 million deaths—
to better understand how physicians are choosing from a 
range of alternative diseases when selecting an underlying 
cause of death that was actually dementia. Countries 
should consider better use of important contextual 
data already being collected, such as intermediate and 
immediate causes of death, to improve the stability and 
robustness of their mortality surveillance systems. Both 
New Zealand and Brazil have already made intermediate 
cause of death data available for this kind of analysis, and 
other countries should consider this low-cost, high-
impact path in the future.
Changes in health estimates between GBD 2016 and 
GBD 2017
Each iteration of GBD re-analyses the entire time series 
by use of newly available data sources from across all 
estimation years and continually improved methods. 
New data and modelling approaches effectively improve 
model validity and decrease uncertainty from various 
sources with the consequence that estimates for a given 
cause, location, and year might differ between GBD 
iterations. The magnitude of these differences between 
GBD 2017 and GBD 2016 is presented in figure 1. Below 
we discuss some specific data and methodology changes 
underlying distinct differences in estimation.
A novel, integrated demographic assessment of popu-
lation, fertility, and all-cause mortality was completed for 
GBD 2017
. This development affected all causes because of 
the inclusion of population estimates in age-sex splitting 
algorithms, but most directly affected maternal and 
HIV
/AIDS-related mortality estimates. The GBD 2017 
assess 
ment of the proportion of all-cause deaths due to 
maternal and neonatal disorders (3·7% [95% UI 3·5–3·8]) 
was similar to that of GBD 2016 (3·6% [3·4–3·8]), with the 
difference largely due to addition of new data and expanded 
subnational estimation. Additionally, GBD 2017 combined 
maternal and neonatal conditions as a category at Level 2 of 
 Global Health Metrics
1772 
www.thelancet.com   Vol 392   November 10, 2018
the cause hierarchy; as a result, causes within this grouping 
are now separately reported at Level 3 (rather than Level 2), 
with neonatal conditions appearing for the first time as the 
second most common Level 3 source of YLLs.
Access to additional data sources led to several 
differences in estimation, including the addition of 
2778 deaths in children younger than 5 years attributable 
to the inclusion of additional VA data for Nigeria61—a high-
population, high-burden location—in GBD 2017
. Similarly, 
introduction of these new data resulted in a decrease in 
estimated mortality from malaria, so that the GBD 2017 
estimate for the year 2016 included 78 200 fewer deaths for 
Nigeria than were estimated by GBD 2016 for that year.
GBD 2017 also included an additional 502 country-
years of cancer registry data and 127 country-years of 
VR system data compared with GBD 2016; 49·6% of the 
new cancer registry data came from the newly released 
Cancer Incidence in Five Continents (CI5 XI) database.62
For GBD 2017, major changes to the modelling strategy 
for dementia and Parkinson’s disease included reallocating 
deaths from causes identified in multiple cause of death 
data in the USA as the likely alternative cause of death if 
dementia had not been assigned as the underlying cause. 
This approach allowed for more accurate identification of 
deaths to be reassigned to dementia and Parkinson’s 
disease, including a sizeable proportion that had been 
assigned to garbage code categories as well as common, 
more specific causes of death in people with dementia or 
Parkinson’s disease.
Changes in data sources and methods have led to 
improved estimates for several causes. Comparing the 
most recent decade between GBD 2016 and GBD 2017, 
2006 to 2016, the estimated increase in deaths from drug 
use disorders in GBD 2017 (55·9% [95% UI 53·1–58·8]) 
was greater than the estimated increase for the same 
period in GBD 2016 (15·2% [4·8–26·4]), driven by a better 
fit to most recent years of data in the USA and the use 
of more appropriate covariates, including sales of pre-
scription opioids by country and the prevalence of 
injecting drug use. Estimates of HIV
/AIDS deaths among 
children in 2016 were higher in GBD 2017 (84 500 deaths 
[75 800–94 200]) than those (61 700 deaths [56 000–68 000]) 
estimated by GBD 2016 for the same year. In countries 
with high-quality VR data, child incidence was adjusted to 
produce mortality estimates that better align with 
recorded HIV
/AIDS deaths. Additionally, the paediatric 
HIV
/AIDS mortality estimates were produced with the 
CD4-count-specific mortality and progression parameters 
developed by UNAIDS.63
Comparison of GBD 2017 to other estimates
The primary comparison dataset for malaria is the World 
Malaria Report (WMR)64 produced by WHO. As the 
Malaria Atlas Project produces results for both GBD and 
the many countries in the WMR, it is not surprising that 
these results align closely. WHO hepatitis estimates for 
2015 present combined mortality results for different 
stages of viral hepatitis infection (acute hepatitis, 
cirrhosis, and liver cancer), but the methods and data 
sources used to generate these estimates are incompletely 
described;65 at least some results were based on additional 
modelling of GBD 2013 results. Total deaths were 
estimated at 1·34 million by WHO in 2015, compared 
with 1·07 million (95% UI 1·02–1·11) for the same year 
in the present analysis (139 000 deaths [116 000–158 000] 
for acute hepa 
titis, 306 000 deaths [281 000–305 000] for 
hepatitis B cirrhosis, 165 000 deaths [159 000–172 000] for 
hepatitis B liver cancer, 294 000 deaths [268 000–319 000] 
for 
hepatitis 
C 
cirrhosis, 
and 
165 000 
deaths 
[159 000–172 000] for hepatitis C liver cancer).
The estimates from the WHO Maternal Child 
Epidemiology Estimation (MCEE) for cause-specific 
under-5 mortality in 2016 at the global level differ from 
those produced by GBD 2017
. Notable differences 
include the absence of estimates for haemoglobino-
pathies by WHO-MCEE and estimates of deaths from 
congenital anomalies (303 000 deaths) that are lower 
than those estimated by GBD (516 000 deaths [95% UI 
446 000–595 000]). 
Lower 
congenital 
estimates 
are 
primarily due to inclusion of VA studies by WHO-MCEE 
that were assessed for GBD but found to be unreliable 
and implausibly low, as described above.66 The number of 
LRI deaths estimated by GBD 2017 for children younger 
than 5 years (828 000 deaths [774 000–884 000]) was 
smaller globally than the number estimated by the MCEE 
group (920 000 deaths in 2015), with the main differences 
in India and Pakistan. GBD uses the sample registration 
system by Indian state, whereas the MCEE group uses 
the Million Deaths Study and the INDEPTH network 
mortality data,66 driving much of the difference between 
those estimates and those from the present study. Iuliano 
and colleagues67 recently estimated 290 000–650 000 seas-
onal influenza-associated respiratory deaths globally. 
Differences in modelling strategy and underlying premise 
account for much of the difference in that estimate from 
those of the present study. Chiefly, the estimate of Iuliano 
and colleagues accounts for any deaths that potentially 
could be associated with influenza, whereas the GBD 2017 
approach estimates only LRI deaths attributable to 
influenza within the GBD counterfactual framework. The 
UN Maternal Mortality Estimation Inter-Agency Group 
(MMEIG) has not updated its estimates since 2015.68
The Globocan project, led by the International Agency 
for Research on Cancer (IARC),69 provides estimates of the 
global and national-level cancer burden for 2012. Whereas 
Globocan only estimates cancer mortality for a single year, 
GBD provides mortality estimates for all diseases over 
time, including for selected subnational locations. This 
approach allows GBD to account for unknown causes of 
death by redistributing these to the most likely underlying 
cause—including cancer. To estimate cancer mortality, 
six different methods are used in Globocan. In GBD, 
cancer mortality was estimated with a single ensemble 
model approach. Despite these differences, estimates at 
 Global Health Metrics
www.thelancet.com   Vol 392   November 10, 2018 
1773
the global level were similar, with Globocan estimating 
8·2 million cancer deaths and GBD estimating 
8·38 million (95% UI 8·26–8·48) for the year 2012 
(appendix 2).
GBD 2017 estimates of deaths from all cardiovascular 
diseases were generally similar to WHO estimates from 
recent years. Non-GBD estimates for specific cardio-
vascular diseases are less common. A recent study 
estimating global and national deaths due to alcoholic 
cardiomyopathy used a model based on all-cause mortality 
and alcohol-attributable fractions.70 The investigators esti-
mated 25 997 deaths (95% CI 17 358–49 096) in 2015 
compared with GBD 2017 estimates of 90 700 (95% UI 
82 800–97 500). Higher GBD estimates are the result of 
the garbage code redistribution method used by GBD, 
although the geo 
graphical distribution of deaths by 
country is similar for both studies. In GBD, a substantial 
number of garbage-coded deaths (eg, heart failure, senility, 
and atherosclerosis) are redistributed to cardiovascular 
disease causes, including ischaemic heart disease and 
alcoholic cardiomyopathy.
In this iteration, we estimated that 136 000 deaths were 
from drug use disorders globally in 2015; by contrast, the 
2017 World Drug Report by the UN Office on Drugs 
and Crime (UNODC) estimated a total of 191 000 drug-
attributable deaths in 2015. Differences might reflect the 
fact that UNODC data are reported directly by member 
states and the definition of drug-related deaths differs 
between countries; some countries include overdose 
deaths, whereas others can include deaths for which 
drug use was considered to be a contributing factor.
A direct comparison on a global level is possible for 
selected injuries and locations. Globally, WHO estimated 
1·25 million road traffic deaths in 2013,71 a lower figure 
than that of GBD 2017, which estimated 1·32 million 
(95% UI 1·29–1·36) road traffic deaths for the year 2013. 
Although this difference might be partly due to different 
modelling strategies, the relatively lower estimate 
was also present in locations with reliable VR data—
for example, for the USA, WHO estimated 34 064 deaths 
for 2013, whereas the GBD 2017 study estimated 41 600 
deaths (39 800–43 000). These differences might also 
be partly due to modelling differences from internal 
consistency requirements in the GBD framework, as 
well as differences in ICD mapping to the underlying 
cause of death. Our estimate of 645 000 deaths 
(559 000–679 000) globally due to falls was only slightly 
lower than WHO’s estimate for 2015 of 646 000 deaths,72 
and a similar difference was present for estimates 
of deaths from self-harm,73 with WHO estimating 
approximately 800 000 deaths annually in recent years 
and GBD esti 
mating approximately 800 000–820 000 
deaths annually in recent years.
Limitations
Limitations remain in GBD 2017 despite advances in 
methodology that addressed some of the difficulties of 
estimating cause-specific mortality at global, regional, 
national, and subnational scales. Limitations that 
primarily affect specific causes—such as identification of 
covariates to address the non-linearity in the association 
between some injuries and the SDI or accounting for 
changes in awareness of NASH as an explanation for 
estimated increased mortality—are described in detail in 
appendix 1 (section 3). Here, we identify limitations with 
applicability across many causes. First, time lags in 
available data, absence of data from specific regions, age 
groups, or time periods, or unreliability in the data that 
are available—as is the case for malaria estimation, where 
a key limitation is the rare and punctuated nature of 
nationally representative surveys of parasite rate; or 
diarrhoea mortality estimation, where data are restricted 
among adults and for the geographical areas with the 
highest mortality levels—can affect the precision of 
estimations. Second, the accuracy with which underlying 
cause of death is assigned is a key limitation for both VR 
data and VA data sources, which is complicated by 
multimorbidity at the time of death. GBD 2017 makes 
substantial efforts to enhance the comparability of results 
by applying corrections for under-registration and garbage 
code redistribution algorithms. Levels or estimated time 
trends might still be affected by systematic problems in 
selected locations. Third, to separately estimate type 1 and 
type 2 diabetes we used a regression method to redistribute 
unspecified diabetes deaths on the basis of the specified 
type 1 and type 2 deaths. As the proportion of unspecified 
deaths is high, even in many good-quality VR systems, the 
type-specific estimates are more uncertain. An additional 
complication is that many excess deaths in people 
with diabetes are preferentially coded to macrovascular 
complications such as stroke and ischaemic heart disease. 
This approach leaves the more direct consequences of 
diabetes such as ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma as 
reasons to code a death to diabetes as the underlying 
cause. These complications can affect type 1 and type 2 
diabetes differently. Ascertaining the correct proportions 
of diabetes deaths that should be assigned to type 1 or 
type 2 diabetes is difficult. Fourth, the percentage of well 
certified data is a useful indicator of data completeness; 
however, quality or accuracy in cause of death certification 
is not necessarily indicated by a low level of identified 
garbage coding for a given location. Fifth, some sources of 
uncertainty will not have been captured by the GBD 2017 
estimation process, including among the covariates used 
in models. Sixth, although some causes use negative 
binomial modelling approaches to improve estimation 
with overdispersed data, we have not yet developed a 
standardised empirical approach for selecting causes to 
use this method. Seventh, the ICD coding convention 
does not distinguish between suicide and deaths associ-
ated with self-harm, and thus our estimate includes both 
intentional and unintentional self-harm. Finally, because 
GBD results are a combination of data and estimation, 
lags in data reporting mean that estimates for the most

recent years rely more on the modelling process, as do 
estimates for locations with low levels of data complete-
ness. However, for causes with scarce data, the provision 
of an estimate with an adequate measure of uncertainty is 
preferable to no information, and identification of these 
causes is an important step in improving the certification 
of deaths globally.
Future directions
Re-estimation of the entire GBD mortality time series 
from 1980 onwards as part of the GBD annual cycle 
offers multiple opportunities for strengthening global 
health estimates. This kind of continuous quality 
improvement74 remains a hallmark of GBD. However, 
the task of informing national and global policy responses 
to changing mortality patterns is still reliant on cause of 
death information that in many cases remains sparse or 
outdated. The improvements in estimation methods 
represented in each iteration of GBD do not mitigate the 
pressing need for investments in data and surveillance 
on a global scale.
Further work is needed to address the misclassification 
that occurs in VR data. For example, multiple death codes 
can be assigned for drug overdoses, and these coding and 
attribution issues can vary across countries. Additional 
work is needed to understand the impact of rapid 
diagnostic testing on the GBD malaria model. Better 
approaches are needed to make use of location, age, and 
time patterns when assigning deaths where the disease 
subtype remains unspecified, such as for diabetes and 
stroke. More specific subtypes will need to be added for 
other conditions, such as vascular dementia, breast cancer, 
and lung cancer. Multiple cause of death data should be 
put to wider use. Information about intermediate causes 
of death can be used to improve estimation of disorders 
that exist as final common pathways to death, including 
sepsis, heart failure, and acute kidney injury. Multiple 
cause of death data might also better inform maternal 
and neonatal death estimates, especially if combined 
models can borrow strength across related conditions. 
Associations between inborn and congenital diseases, 
developmental disorders, and infectious or malnutrition-
related deaths are also likely. Additional data about 
maternal exposures, including tobacco, air pollution, 
alcohol, and obesity, could lead to cause-specific mortality 
estimates among newborn babies.
An important goal of the GBD collaboration is the 
production of estimates for increasingly granular 
locations, down to areas as small as a 5 × 5 km grid. 
Estimates of diarrhoea, LRI, and tuberculosis mortality 
would all have greater impact if produced with a higher 
degree of geographical precision. Ascertaining the 
location of injury for causes such as road injuries, falls, 
drowning, and fires is also an important goal and could 
improve understanding of where investments in civil 
infrastructure might most benefit the population. Injury 
models could also make use of satellite and other open 
data sources to incorporate more information about the 
presence and use of improved roads, use of seatbelts, or 
availability of firearms.
Conclusion
GBD 2017 reveals both long-term and more recent 
patterns in global health. The number of deaths due to 
communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional 
causes continues to decline, although at varying rates, 
whereas the number of deaths from NCDs is increasing 
and those from injuries remains stable. There is evidence 
that previously observed declines in death rates of some 
common diseases are now either slowing or have ceased, 
primarily for NCDs. Mortality estimates are being made 
with increasing detail as a result of improved methods 
for correcting biases in the data and the addition of new 
data sources, new causes, and new subnational locations. 
The GBD collaboration has expanded to include experts 
from 140 countries, with formal government engagement 
leading to the production of subnational estimates. 
Investments are being made to extend the reach of high-
quality mortality surveillance and VR. SDG targets tied to 
mortality rates will be able to use annual GBD results to 
benchmark progress and identify best practices in 
every country.
