ABSTRACT
Although the use of chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) based on single-chain antibodies for gene immunotherapy of cancers is
increasing due to promising recent results, the earliest CAR therapeutic trials were done for HIV-1 infection in the late 1990s.
This approach utilized a CAR based on human CD4 as a binding domain and was abandoned for a lack of efficacy. The growing
number of HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies (BNAbs) offers the opportunity to generate novel CARs that may be more ac-
tive and revisit this modality for HIV-1 immunotherapy. We used sequences from seven well-defined BNAbs varying in binding
sites and generated single-chain-antibody-based CARs. These CARs included 10E8, 3BNC117, PG9, PGT126, PGT128, VRC01,
and X5. Each novel CAR exhibited conformationally relevant expression on the surface of transduced cells, mediated specific
proliferation and killing in response to HIV-1-infected cells, and conferred potent antiviral activity (reduction of viral replica-
tion in log10 units) to transduced CD8� T lymphocytes. The antiviral activity of these CARs was reproducible but varied accord-
ing to the strain of virus. These findings indicated that BNAbs are excellent candidates for developing novel CARs to consider for
the immunotherapeutic treatment of HIV-1.
IMPORTANCE
While chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) using single-chain antibodies as binding domains are growing in popularity for gene
immunotherapy of cancers, the earliest human trials of CARs were done for HIV-1 infection. However, those trials failed, and
the approach was abandoned for HIV-1. The only tested CAR against HIV-1 was based on the use of CD4 as the binding domain.
The growing availability of HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies (BNAbs) affords the opportunity to revisit gene immunother-
apy for HIV-1 using novel CARs based on single-chain antibodies. Here we construct and test a panel of seven novel CARs based
on diverse BNAb types and show that all these CARs are functional against HIV-1.
R
ecent years have seen a surge in immunotherapeutic ap-
proaches for treating malignancy, including numerous prom-
ising human trials of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) gene ther-
apy to generate tumor-specific T cells, based on the importance of
CD8� T lymphocytes (CTLs) in tumor surveillance and malig-
nant cell clearance through cytotoxicity. The general approach has
been to identify monoclonal antibodies that bind a tumor cell
surface antigen and use a single-chain version of the antibody as
an artificial T cell receptor by genetic fusion to the CD3 � chain
signaling domain. As opposed to native T cell receptors (TCRs),
CARs have the advantage of being major histocompatibility com-
plex (MHC) unrestricted and therefore broadly applicable across
human individuals and are also unaffected by tumor cell immune
evasion through MHC downregulation.
Notably, one of the earliest tested clinical applications of CARs
was for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. In 1994, Roberts et al.
designed two virus-specific CARs using CD4 or a single-chain
antibody as the binding domain for recombinant gp120 on the
surface of cells (1), and these CARs were shown subsequently to
have the direct capacity to kill HIV-1-infected cells and suppress
viral replication at levels similar to those of HIV-1-specific CTL
clones isolated from infected persons (2). Based on these data, the
CD4-based CAR, consisting of the CD4 extracellular and trans-
membrane domains fused to the CD3 � intracellular signaling
domain (CD4� �), was advanced to clinical trials starting in the
late 1990s, using retroviral transduction of autologous peripheral
blood T lymphocytes and reinfusion. Unfortunately, this effort
was abandoned after these trials showed safety but no clear bene-
fits: one study with viremic subjects showed no reduction in
viremia, although there appeared to be decreased rectal tissue vi-
rus burden (3), while another study of antiretroviral drug-treated
subjects with baseline undetectable viremia not surprisingly
showed no change in the persisting blood viral reservoir in the
form of proviral DNA (4). Follow-up of these studies after more
than a decade showed low-level persistence of transduced cells
without evidence of malignancy (5).
Several factors may have contributed to failure in these trials.
The Moloney-based retroviral vector was relatively inefficient,
and peripheral blood T cells were massively expanded ex vivo us-
ing supraphysiological levels of interleukin-2, likely contributing
to the rapid loss of CAR expression and death of reinfused cells.
The CAR itself may have been problematic: the CD4 domain may
have allowed HIV-1 infection of transduced CTLs, or there could

 have been selection for viral escape through reduced CD4 binding,
which can vary greatly between different HIV-1 envelopes (6).
The identification of a growing number of broadly neutralizing
antibodies (BNAbs) against HIV-1 offers the possibility of creat-
ing new HIV-1-specific CARs with improved properties. These
BNAbs have high affinity and excellent reactivity against various
HIV-1 strains, which could translate to efficient CARs with broad
coverage of HIV-1 variation. Here we report the generation and
testing of CARs based on seven BNAbs that recognize diverse
epitopes on the HIV-1 envelope.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cells and media. The immortalized HIV-1-permissive CD4-expressing
cell lines T1 (7) and T2 (8) and Jurkat cells were maintained as previously
described (9–11) in complete medium (R10) consisting of RPMI 1640
(Lonza, Allendale, NJ) supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine (Mediat-
ech, Manassas, VA), 100 U/ml penicillin (Mediatech, Manassas, VA), 100
U/ml streptomycin (Mediatech, Manassas, VA), 10 mM HEPES (Sigma,
St. Louis, MO), and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS)
(Sigma, St. Louis, MO). HEK 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s
modified essential medium supplemented with L-glutamine, penicillin,
streptomycin, and FBS as described above and previously (12). Primary
CD8� T lymphocytes were isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear
cells (PBMCs) of healthy HIV-1-uninfected donors by using anti-CD8
antibody-coated magnetic beads according to the manufacturer’s direc-
tions (MACS column separation kit; Miltenyi, San Diego, CA) and then
cultured for 5 days in R10 supplemented with 50 U/ml recombinant hu-
man interleukin-2 (NIH AIDS Reagent Repository) (R10-50) in the pres-
ence of the anti-CD3 antibody 12F6 (13), yielding a purity of �99%
CD3�/CD8� cells by flow cytometry. All experiments were confirmed
with cells from multiple donors and showed no significant donor-specific
differences.
Construction of CAR vectors. The backbone for novel CAR construc-
tions was the pTRPE-cMET-BB� CAR plasmid, provided as a generous
gift from Carl June. This lentiviral expression vector (Fig. 1) contained the
gene for the CAR with a single-chain antibody against hepatocyte growth
factor receptor (cMET) fused to the human IgG4 hinge sequence, the
human CD8 transmembrane sequence, and cytoplasmic domains of hu-
man 4-1BB (CD137) and the human CD3 complex � chain (CD247). This
vector was modified by creating a novel ApaI restriction site via a silent
mutation in the hinge sequence (Fig. 1). This was accomplished by sub-
cloning the XbaI-SmaI restriction fragment into pUC19, in which the
mutation was created by point mutagenesis (QuikChange kit; Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA). After sequencing of the entire fragment to ensure no PCR-
induced errors, this restriction fragment was ligated into the parental
vector. Single-chain antibody sequences of heavy chain-linker-light chain
(Table 1) were synthesized as codon-optimized genes preceded by the
signal sequence for granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor
(MLLLVTSLLLCELPHPAFLLIP) and followed by the beginning of the
hinge region, flanked by XbaI and ApaI restriction sites, allowing ligation
into the parental vector after restriction digestion. The BNAb sequences
used for this approach included 10E8 (14), 3BNC117 (15), PG9 (16),
PGT126 (17), PGT128 (17), VRC01 (18), and X5 (19).
Production of lentiviral vectors and transduction of cells. Lenti-
virus was produced by cotransfection of HEK 293T cells with a CAR
lentiviral vector construct plasmid (10 �g) in conjunction with pack-
aging and pseudotyping vectors, including the lentiviral packaging
plasmid pCMVDR8.2DVPR (7 �g) and the vesicular stomatitis virus en-
velope glycoprotein G expression vector pHCMVG (3 �g), using BioT
transfection reagent according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Bioland,
Paramount, CA) with 5 � 106 HEK 293T cells that had been seeded into a
T75 tissue culture flask 24 h previously. Supernatants were obtained 24
and 48 h after transfection, passed through a 0.45-�m filter, and concen-
trated by ultracentrifugation (26,000 rpm for 90 min at 4°C) (SW28 rotor;
Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). Aliquots containing �50 ng HIV-1 p24
antigen in 50 �l were frozen at �80°C until use.
For transduction of primary CD8� T lymphocytes, polystyrene 6-well
plates (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) were coated with RetroNectin ac-
cording to the manufacturer’s instructions (TaKaRa, Mountain View,
CA). An aliquot of the lentiviral vector was diluted to 500 �l in R10 and
placed into a precoated well, followed by centrifugation at 2,000 � g for 2
h at 32°C (Sorvall Legend RT; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Grand Island,
NY). After aspiration of the medium, 106 recently stimulated CD8� T
lymphocytes were added per well in a total volume of 2 ml R10-50. After
overnight incubation in a tissue culture incubator, the cells were trans-
ferred to fresh R10-50 and cultured for about 7 days before assessment of
transduction efficiency (see below).
For Jurkat cells, 106 cells in log-phase growth were incubated with the
lentiviral vector for 4 h with intermittent shaking, washed, and resus-
pended in fresh R10.
Western blotting for CD3 �. The cell lysate from 2 � 106 transduced
cells was prepared by lysing the cells in lysis buffer (0.5% NP-40, 0.5%
sodium deoxycholate, 50 mM NaCl, 25 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM EDTA)
containing 10 mM phenylmethyl sulfonyl (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and 1�
Halt protease inhibitors (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Proteins were sepa-
rated by loading of 20 �l of the lysate onto a 10% NuPAGE Bis-Tris gel
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and electrophoresis, followed by blotting onto
a 0.45-�m polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Millipore, Bil-
lerica, MA). The membrane was probed by using a mouse anti-human
CD247 monoclonal antibody (catalog number 551033; BD Pharmingen,
San Jose, CA) and the SuperSignal West Pico detection kit (Pierce, Rock-
ford, IL).
Flow cytometry for cell surface single-chain antibody expression.
Transduced cells were washed, resuspended in 100 �l of wash buffer (5%
bovine serum albumin [BSA] with 2 mM EDTA in phosphate-buffered
saline [PBS]) containing either fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conju-
gated goat anti-human F(ab)2 antibody (catalog number 109-006-003;
Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) or isotype con-
trol antibody, and incubated for 30 min at 4°C. After washing in fresh
wash buffer, the cells were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde and analyzed by
flow cytometry (LSR Fortessa II cytometer [BD Biosciences] and FlowJo
software [FlowJo, Ashland, OR]).
Flow cytometry for CAR-mediated proliferation of transduced
CD8� T lymphocytes in response to HIV-1-infected target cells. HIV-
1-infected T2 cells, which are MHC class I low due to a deletion in the
transporter associated with processing (TAP) (8) and were previously
shown to be suitable target cells for an HIV-1-specific CAR (20), served as
FIG 1 CAR structure and construction strategy. The parental vector contained a CAR based on a single-chain antibody. This vector was modified with a silent
mutation to create an ApaI site (GGCCCT¡GGGCCC; mutated nucleotides are underlined) in the hinge region of the CAR gene (within a sequence-confirmed
XbaI-SmaI intermediate plasmid vector). New CAR genes were generated by the synthesis of single-chain antibody genes that were substituted into this vector
via XbaI-ApaI restriction fragments.

 target cells. These cells were infected with an excess of HIV-1NL4-3-based
reporter virus containing a gene for murine CD24 (mCD24) in the vpr
locus (21) to yield �90% infected cells by 3 or 4 days after infection, as
previously reported (9, 10, 12). These cells were irradiated immediately
before use with 10,000 rads in a cesium irradiator, and peripheral blood
mononuclear cells from a healthy donor were irradiated with 3,000 rads
(feeder PBMCs). CAR-transduced primary CD8� T lymphocytes were
labeled with CellTrace Violet and washed according to the manufacturer’s
directions (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Grand Island, NY). In a 48-well plate
well, 5 � 105 labeled transduced cells were added to 5 � 105 irradiated
infected T2 cells and 2 � 106 irradiated feeder PBMCs and cultured in 1 ml
R10-50 for 5 days with a medium change after 3 days. Flow cytometry
(LSR Fortessa II cytometer; BD Biosciences) was then performed with
costaining for human CD8 (peridinin chlorophyll protein [PerCP]–anti-
human CD8, catalog number 30130; BioLegend, San Diego, CA), and
proliferation was analyzed by using FlowJo software (FlowJo, Ashland,
OR).
Chromium release killing assays for CAR-mediated killing of HIV-
1-infected target cells. T2 cells infected with HIV-1NL4-3 as described
above were used as target cells for CAR-transduced primary CD8� T
lymphocytes in standard 51Cr release assays as previously described (9, 10,
12). Briefly, infected and control uninfected T2 cells were 51Cr labeled for
1 h and incubated with or without effector CD8� T lymphocytes for 4 h at
various cell ratios in a 96-well U-bottom plate. Supernatants were then
harvested for measurement of extracellular 51Cr by microscintillation
counting in 96-well plates. Spontaneous release was measured on target
cells without effector cells, and maximal release was measured on target
cells lysed with 2.5% Triton X-100. Specific lysis was calculated as follows:
(experimental released chromium � spontaneous release)/(maximal re-
lease � spontaneous release).
Virus suppression assays. The ability of CAR-transduced CD8� T
lymphocytes to suppress the replication of HIV-1 was tested as previously
described in detail (2, 9, 11, 12, 22–24). HIV-1 strains tested were obtained
from the NIH AIDS Reference and Reagent Repository, including
94US_33931N (catalog number 11250), 90_US873 (catalog number
11251), 96TH_NP1538 (catalog number 11252), and 00TZ_A246 (cata-
log number 11256). In brief, T1 cells transduced with human CCR5 were
infected at a multiplicity of 0.1 tissue culture infectious doses per cell and
cocultured in a 96-well plate with CAR-transduced cells at a ratio of 5 �
104 to 1.25 � 104 cells, respectively, in 200 �l of R10-50 or with no effector
cells as a control. The effector cells had been confirmed to be �90%
transduced. Experiments under each condition were run in triplicate, and
viral replication was monitored by using a p24 quantitative enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (XpressBio, Frederick, MD).
RESULTS
Genetic construction of chimeric antigen receptors based on
broadly neutralizing antibodies against HIV-1. A set of BNAbs
was selected based on the binding of different HIV-1 Env domains
and the availability of sequences (Table 1). These BNAbs included
seven antibodies targeting the CD4-binding site, the CD4-bind-
ing-induced site on gp120, the gp120 V2 loop, gp120 N-glycans,
and the membrane-proximal region of gp41. Genes for single-
chain versions of each antibody were created by the synthesis of
codon-optimized sequences for the heavy and light chains, sepa-
rated by a (GGGGS)3 linker, and these genes were substituted for
the single-chain antibody in a second-generation CAR vector con-
taining the 4-1BB signaling domain fused to the CD3 � signaling
domain (Fig. 1).
Confirmation of expression and potential functionality of
the novel CARs. The CAR genes were delivered by lentiviral vec-
tors to Jurkat cells for initial confirmation of expression and func-
tionality. Western blotting for CD3 � confirmed that the trans-
duced cells contained both native CD3 � and the expected larger
CD3 �-containing CAR for all seven constructs (Fig. 2). Flow cy-
tometry for cell surface CAR expression using a goat antibody
against human Fab (antigen-binding antibody fragment) further
demonstrated the cell surface expression of each CAR (Fig. 3).
Primary CD8� T lymphocytes were then transduced with the len-
tiviral vectors, and flow cytometry also confirmed cell surface
CAR expression for each construct, although the transduction ef-
ficiency was lower than that for Jurkat cells. By using the goat
anti-human Fab antibody as a stimulus, there was selective expan-
sion and enrichment of the CAR-transduced cells within the bulk
population (Fig. 4), indicating that cross-linking of CARs induced
the proliferation of the transduced cells analogous to anti-CD3
antibody-induced proliferation of normal T lymphocytes.
CAR-transduced primary CD8� T lymphocytes proliferate
in response to HIV-1-infected cells. Enriched CAR-transduced
(�90%) primary CD8� T lymphocyte effector cells were tested for
their capacity to proliferate in response to HIV-1-infected cells.
After coculture with irradiated HIV-1NL4-3-infected T2 cells or
control uninfected T2 cells, all effector cells transduced with CARs
exhibited HIV-1-specific proliferation to various degrees (Fig. 5).
These results confirmed the retained specificity of the single-chain

 versions of the parental antibodies against HIV-1 envelope on the
surface of infected cells.
All novel CARs mediate specific killing of HIV-1-infected
target cells. The enriched CAR-transduced effector cells were
tested for specific killing of HIV-1-infected CD4� lymphocytes.
They were assayed in standard chromium release assays against
HIV-1NL4-3-infected T2 cells or control uninfected T2 cells (Fig.
6). All CARs mediated substantial killing of infected versus unin-
fected target cells at effector-to-target cell ratios of 5:1, indicating
specific targeting of HIV-1-infected cells.
All novel CARs exhibit antiviral activity. The enriched CAR-
transduced effector cells were also tested for antiviral activity
against infected CD4� cells. T2-CCR5 cells were infected with a
panel of HIV-1 strains, including primary R5-tropic isolates, and
cultured in the absence or presence of the CAR-transduced effec-
tor cells. Virus replication was assessed by measurement of p24
antigen levels between days 7 and 10 of culture. Suppression of
replication was calculated as the difference in log10 units of p24

domain of the novel CARs. After transduction of primary CD8� T lympho-
cytes with each of the seven CAR vectors, the cells were serially passaged (10
days each passage) by using stimulation with a goat anti-human Fab antibody
with irradiated allogeneic feeder PBMCs and interleukin-2. The percentage of
cells determined to express CAR was determined by flow cytometry as de-
scribed in the legend of Fig. 3.
FIG 5 Proliferation mediated by novel CAR interactions with HIV-1-infected target cells. Primary CD8� T lymphocytes transduced with the panel of CARs were
enriched to �90% purity and labeled with CellTrace Violet and then cocultured with irradiated HIV-1 NL4-3-infected T2 cells. CellTrace Violet fluorescence was
assessed by flow cytometry after 7 days. The open histograms indicate transduced cells exposed to control uninfected cells, while the shaded histograms indicate
those exposed to infected cells.
FIG 6 Specific killing of HIV-1-infected target cells mediated by novel CARs.
CAR-transduced primary CD8� T lymphocytes were cocultured with HIV-1-
infected T2 cells in standard 4-h chromium release assays to assess killing
mediated by the CARs. PGT128- and PG9-based CARs were tested for killing
in an experiment separate from those for the other CARs. The relative efficien-
cies of the CARs varied between experiments, and no single CAR was consis-
tently superior.

 between cultures without and those with effector cells, which was
then normalized as the ratio to total replication without effector
cells (Fig. 7). Across multiple experiments, each CAR exhibited
consistent levels of antiviral activity against five HIV-1 strains,
including four subtype B strains and one subtype C strain (Fig. 8).
For this limited set of viruses, some CARs, such as the one based
on PGT126, appeared to have broader coverage than others, such
as the one based on 3BNC117.
DISCUSSION
Given the success of CARs for cancer immunotherapy and short-
comings of the prior attempt of this approach for HIV-1 treat-
ment, revisiting CARs for HIV-1 infection is appropriate. We took
advantage of the new generation of BNAbs, which are remarkable
for their affinity, potency, and breadth of HIV-1 neutralization.
These BNAbs were engineered as single-chain constructs to serve
as binding domains for novel CARs.
Somewhat unexpectedly given the uncertain affinity of anti-
bodies converted to single-chain versions, all seven CAR con-
structs showed HIV-1-specific functional activity. Each CAR con-
struct demonstrated conformationally relevant cell surface
expression (by binding of a goat anti-human Fab antibody) as well
as mediation of HIV-1-specific proliferation, killing, and suppres-
sion of viral replication. The generally high binding affinity of
BNAbs may have afforded the retention of enough affinity of the
single-chain versions to meet the much-lower-affinity require-
ment of T cell receptors for signaling. Thus, each CAR conferred
the functional properties that are likely important for transduced-
cell expansion and clearance of HIV-1-infected cells in vivo.
Against HIV-1NL4-3, these CARs had antiviral properties simi-
lar to those determined in preclinical in vitro antiviral tests of the
CD4� � CAR (2) that was previously advanced to clinical trials.
Matching these novel CARs, that CAR mediated �50 to 60% lysis
of cells infected with HIV-1IIIB (the source of the Env in HIV-
1NL4-3) and a �40 to 50% log efficiency of virus suppression. In a
separate previous study, the CD4� � CAR also mediated HIV-1-
specific proliferation of transduced T lymphocytes (1).
It is unclear as to which in vitro assays might predict the supe-
riority of one CAR over the other for use in vivo. While prolifera-
tion and antiviral activity are likely to be the critical activities for
efficacy in vivo, our in vitro assays are semiquantitative, and con-
ditions may not reflect those in vivo. Our data suggest that some
BNAb-based CARs have broader activity against HIV-1 variability
FIG 7 Sample calculation of percent log efficiency of suppression by CAR-transduced cells. T1-CCR5 cells were infected with the indicated viruses at a
multiplicity of infection of 10�1 tissue culture infective doses/cell and cultured with or without CAR 10E8-transduced CD8� T cells (�90% enriched) at an
effector-to-target cell ratio of 1:4. (Left) The HIV-1 p24 antigen level was measured by an ELISA on day 7. Log units of p24 antigen (log10 picograms per milliliter)
are indicated above each bar. Virus suppression by CAR-transduced cells ranged from 5.44 � 4.73 � 0.71 log10 units to 5.77 � 3.52 � 2.25 log10 units (80.5%
to 99.4%) for HIV-133931N and HIV-1NL4-3, respectively. In general, replication without effector cells reached 3 to 6 log10 pg/ml (103 to 106 pg/ml). (Right) Virus
suppression is normalized to total replication without effector cells as the percent reduction in log10 units of p24 antigen comparing cultures with and those
without added effector cells: for HIV-1NL4-3, (5.77 � 3.52)/5.77 � 0.390 � 39.0%; for HIV-1873, (5.06 �3.77)/5.06 � 0.255 � 25.5%; and for HIV-133931N,
(5.44 � 4.73)/5.44 � 0.130 � 13.0%.
FIG 8 Efficiencies of novel CAR-transduced primary CD8� T cells against a panel of HIV-1 isolates. CAR-transduced primary CD8� T cells were tested against
a panel of 4 subtype B viruses and one subtype C virus (TZA246) to determine the percent efficiency of log suppression, as shown in Fig. 7. For each virus, bars
represent the medians for all replicates across 1 to 6 (mean, 2.9) independent experiments, each with triplicates, with standard-error bars. Note that a 30% log
efficiency of suppression for a typical experiment with control viral replication of 5 log10 pg/ml would correspond to a reduction of 1.5 log10 units, or 96.8%
suppression of viral replication.

 than others, although more testing will be required. Given an op-
timal range of affinity for CARs against their target proteins,
where higher or lower levels of affinity yield inferior activity (25),
it may be that CARs will differ in their persistence depending on
their affinity for the specific HIV-1 Env sequence encountered in
vivo. In this regard, the demonstration by Webb et al. (26) that
different BNAbs have highly variable neutralization curve slopes
might suggest that BNAbs with a flatter slope would have a larger
“sweet spot” of affinity across various HIV-1 Envs. Those authors
reported that CD4-binding site (including VRC01 and 3BNC117)
and V3-glycan (including PGT128) BNAbs exhibit steeper slopes,
while V2-glycan (including PG9) and membrane-proximal exter-
nal region (including 10E8) BNAbs exhibit flatter slopes. How-
ever, this appears to be contradicted by our observation that the
PG9- and 10E8-based CARs seem to have less breadth of antiviral
activity than the VRC01- and 3BNC117-based CARs, suggesting
the influence of other potential factors such as the preservation of
affinity in the single-chain form and/or a greater reserve of affin-
ity. Further supporting this point, while X5 was originally consid-
ered broadly neutralizing, it has relatively poor neutralizing
breadth against various HIV-1 isolates compared to the other an-
tibodies tested here (27) yet demonstrates good breadth as a CAR.
Regardless, because BNAbs seem to be escaped by HIV-1 Env
variation in their original hosts (28–30), viral variability and es-
cape may remain a barrier to the therapeutic implementation of
BNAb-based CARs.
In summary, we have demonstrated that seven BNAbs with
various epitope specificities all have activity as single-chain HIV-1
receptors in CARs. All constructs have the ability to recognize
infected cells for proliferation, killing, and suppression of viral
replication, although they may vary in their breadth of HIV-1
sequence diversity coverage. Additional studies will be necessary
to understand and assay the properties important for transduced-
cell proliferation and function for in vivo immunotherapies based
on BNAb CARs.
