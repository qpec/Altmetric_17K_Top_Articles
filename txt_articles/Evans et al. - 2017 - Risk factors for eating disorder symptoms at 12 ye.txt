Eating disorders pose risks to health and wellbeing in young adolescents, but prospective studies of risk
factors are scarce and this has impeded prevention efforts. This longitudinal study aimed to examine risk
factors for eating disorder symptoms in a population-based birth cohort of young adolescents at 12 years.
Participants from the Gateshead Millennium Study birth cohort (n ¼ 516; 262 girls and 254 boys)
completed self-report questionnaire measures of eating disorder symptoms and putative risk factors at
age 7 years, 9 years and 12 years, including dietary restraint, depressive symptoms and body dissatis-
faction. Body mass index (BMI) was also measured at each age.
Within-time correlates of eating disorder symptoms at 12 years of age were greater body dissatis-
faction for both sexes and, for girls only, higher depressive symptoms. For both sexes, higher eating
disorder symptoms at 9 years old significantly predicted higher eating disorder symptoms at 12 years
old. Dietary restraint at 7 years old predicted boys' eating disorder symptoms at age 12, but not girls'.
Factors that did not predict eating disorder symptoms at 12 years of age were BMI (any age), girls’ dietary
restraint at 7 years and body dissatisfaction at 7 and 9 years of age for both sexes.
In this population-based study, different patterns of predictors and correlates of eating disorder
symptoms were found for girls and boys. Body dissatisfaction, a purported risk factor for eating disorder
symptoms in young adolescents, developed concurrently with eating disorder symptoms rather than
preceding them. However, restraint at age 7 and eating disorder symptoms at age 9 years did predict 12-
year eating disorder symptoms. Overall, our findings suggest that efforts to prevent disordered eating
might beneficially focus on preadolescent populations.

1. Introduction
The incidence of eating disorders rises from childhood to early
adolescence, defined as 10e13 years of age (Nicholls, Lynn, & Viner,
2011; Sawyer et al., 2012). Consequently, most previous research
into the developmental psychopathology of eating disorders has
begun at around 12 years old. By this age, eating disorder symp-
toms are already present in non-clinical populations at levels
similar to those found in late adolescence (Wichstrøm, 2000),
which suggests that the antecedent conditions for such disorders
arise before adolescence. Eating disorder symptoms do not corre-
spond, in severity or specificity, to full-syndrome eating disorders.
Instead they encompass a broad array of dimensional maladaptive
cognitions and behaviours relating to eating and weight. These
cognitions and behaviours are found across the range of full-
syndrome eating disorder diagnoses as well as in sub-syndromal
variants (Walsh & Sysko, 2009). An understanding of causal risk
factors for eating disorder symptoms is important because such
symptoms increase children's risk of subsequent weight gain,

 depression, weight cycling and full-syndrome eating disorders in
adolescence (Chamay-Weber, Narring, & Michaud, 2005; Combs,
Pearson, Zapolski, & Smith, 2012; Field et al., 2003; Stice,
Hayward, Cameron, Killen, & Taylor, 2000).
A recent comprehensive evidence synthesis highlighted a clear
research need for prospective examinations of risk factors for
disordered eating, including non-clinical samples of both boys and
girls and commencing at a younger age than previous studies i.e.
6e10 years of age (Culbert, Racine, & Klump, 2015). In the current
study, we prospectively examined potential risk factors, starting at
age 7, to determine which variables contributed to the develop-
ment of eating disorder symptoms at 12 years of age. These vari-
ables included body dissatisfaction, depression, dietary restraint,
body mass index (BMI), and previous eating disorder symptoms.
Given the absence of an established theoretical framework within
which to situate the longitudinal development of eating disorder
symptoms over preadolescence - mainly due to an absence of
prospective data - these predictor variables were selected from
intrapersonal risk factors for disordered eating in older adolescents
and adults, broadly in line with the dual pathway model (Stice &
Agras, 1998).
1.1. Putative predictors of eating disorder symptoms at 12 years of
age
It is widely accepted that greater evaluative body dissatisfaction,
also referred to as lower body esteem, contributes to the emergence
and maintenance of eating disorder symptoms (Stice & Shaw, 2002;
Stice, 2002). This consensus is based primarily upon findings with
older, predominantly female samples. In contrast, findings with
younger, mixed-sex groups are equivocal: some studies suggest
that body dissatisfaction is directly correlated with, but does not
predict, eating disorder symptoms over pre-adolescence, (Allen,
Byrne, McLean, & Davis, 2008; Parkinson, Drewett, Le Couteur, &
Adamson, 2012), instead emerging as a predictor at around 13
years old (Ferreiro, Seoane, & Senra, 2012). Conversely, other
studies have found an effect in preadolescence, but only for boys
(Keel, Fulkerson, & Leon, 1997) or only for girls (Gardner, Stark,
Friedman, & Jackson, 2000). The effects and developmental dy-
namics of body dissatisfaction's relation to eating disorder symp-
toms may vary depending on age and gender (Culbert et al., 2015).
In these terms, body dissatisfaction and eating disorder symptoms
may co-emerge in pre-adolescence but the former may drive the
latter during adolescence itself.
Body dissatisfaction is extremely common in preadolescence,
affecting around 40% of children aged 6 to 11 (Truby & Paxton,
2008), whereas elevated eating disorder symptoms are less prev-
alent, (Erickson & Gerstle, 2007; Westerberg-Jacobson, Ghaderi, &
Edlund, 2012). There is a degree of conceptual and statistical
overlap between the two. However, the aforementioned prevalence
data suggest that it is unlikely that the former should be considered
an exclusive subcategory of the latter as opposed to a potential risk
factor in its own right. Further investigation is needed regarding
body dissatisfaction's role as a risk factor for eating disorder
symptoms in younger mixed-sex groups.
In addition to a direct relationship, body dissatisfaction may
lead to eating disorder symptoms via the mediating influences of
elevated depressive symptoms and greater dietary restraint (Stice,
Ng, & Shaw, 2010), as proposed in the dual pathway model of
eating pathology (Stice & Agras, 1998). Limited evidence suggests
that depressive symptoms predict eating disorder symptoms in
early adolescence among girls (Rodgers, Paxton, & McLean, 2014),
although a reciprocal relationship has also been reported (Ferreiro,
Wichstrøm, Seoane, & Senra, 2014). Dietary restraint has been
found to predict disordered eating in adolescents (Neumark-
Sztainer et al., 2006) and similarly, dietary restraint at 7 years of
age was found to predict subsequent eating disorder symptoms at 9
years of age in a previous study with this cohort (Parkinson et al.,
2012). It is possible that dietary restraint constitutes a precursor
or subcomponent of eating disorder symptoms although, like body
dissatisfaction, dietary restraint is highly prevalent (Shunk & Birch,
2004) whereas eating disorder symptoms are less so. A cross-
sectional study recently demonstrated that depressive symptoms
and dietary restraint fully mediated the relationship between body
dissatisfaction and eating disorder symptoms in girls aged 7e11
years (Evans, Tovee, Boothroyd, & Drewett, 2013).
Higher body mass index (BMI) is another proposed risk factor
for higher eating disorder symptoms, although previous studies
have not found evidence of this relationship in childhood (e.g.,
Gardner et al., 2000; Parkinson et al., 2012) with rare exceptions
(Jendrzyca & Warschburger, 2016). Research with adults and ado-
lescents suggests that body dissatisfaction may fully mediate the
inconsistently observed relationships between eating disorder
symptoms and BMI (Lynch, Heil, Wagner, & Havens, 2008; Micali
et al., 2015; Rohde, Stice, & Marti, 2015; Stice & Whitenton, 2002).
Continuity of eating disorder symptoms over time has been
observed amongst children and young adolescents in most previ-
ous longitudinal studies (e.g., Ferreiro et al., 2014; Gardner et al.,
2000; Keel et al., 1997), suggesting that eating disorder symptoms
become at least partially established at an early age (Wichstrøm,
2000). This highlights the importance of controlling for initial
levels of the outcome variable (Stice, 2002) when predicting an
outcome across time, something that has not always been done in
previous studies of eating disorder symptoms with preadolescents
(e.g., Davison, Markey, & Birch, 2003).
1.2. Sex differences in eating disorder symptoms
Both eating disorder symptoms and depressive symptoms are
overrepresented in girls from 12 to 13 years of age onwards
(Ferreiro, Seoane, & Senra, 2011), and it has been proposed that
these internalising symptoms constitute female-specific reciprocal
risk factors whose mutual influence escalates with time (Beato-
Fern�
andez, Rodríguez-Cano, Pelayo-Delgado, & Calaf, 2007). How-
ever, other studies suggest that depressive symptoms also play a
direct causal role in boys’ eating disorder symptoms from around
the age of 13 (Ferreiro et al., 2011). The influence of body dissatis-
faction on eating disorder symptoms, too, may vary with sex:
Ferreiro et al. (2012) found that body dissatisfaction and eating
disorder symptoms were directly correlated in boys and girls at age
11 but that body dissatisfaction emerged as a causal risk factor for
girls only, from age 13 onwards. However, none of these studies
looked at preadolescent risk factors, and dietary restraint does not
appear to have been examined as a predictor in this context.
Questions remain regarding sex differences in the emergence of
eating disorder symptoms, and further longitudinal studies of these
phenomena in preadolescent girls and boys are clearly merited
(Culbert et al., 2015).
1.3. Aims and hypotheses
The present study set out to examine risk factors by identifying
earlier predictors and within-time correlates of eating disorder
symptoms in a population-based birth cohort (Gateshead Millen-
nium Study: GMS) of boys and girls at 12 years of age. The first aim
was to identify within-time associations of eating disorder symp-
toms with measures of body dissatisfaction, depressive symptoms,
and BMI all at 12 years of age. Associations were examined sepa-
rately for boys and girls. The second aim was to identify prospective
predictors of eating disorder symptoms at 12 years of age, again
E.H. Evans et al. / Appetite 108 (2017) 12e20
13
 separately for boys and girls, taking into account prior eating dis-
order symptoms at 9 years of age. Putative across-time predictors
included prior body dissatisfaction measured at 7 and 9 years of
age, and dietary restraint measured at 7 years. BMI was also
measured at 7 and 9 years.
Our expectations for the within-time associations (correlates) at
12 years of age were that there would be a direct association be-
tween eating disorder symptoms and body dissatisfaction for both
boys and girls, based on existing findings to this effect (Ferreiro
et al., 2012). In contrast, we expected that depressive symptoms
would be directly associated with eating disorder symptoms for
girls but not boys, based on the balance of evidence for their
reciprocal relationship in girls but not boys of this age (e.g., Beato-
Fern�
andez et al., 2007). Previous research also led us to expect that
BMI would be strongly directly associated with body dissatisfaction
but not with disordered eating in participants of both sexes (Micali
et al., 2015).
Our expectations for the prospective predictors of eating disor-
der symptoms at 12 years of age were that prior eating disorder
symptoms at 9 years of age would be a strong direct predictor for
both boys and girls, given evidence of continuity of such symptoms
across preadolescence and beyond (Ferreiro et al., 2014). We
further expected higher eating disorder symptoms at 12 years of
age to be predicted by greater dietary restraint at age 7 for boys and
girls, as has been found previously at 9 years of age (Parkinson et al.,
2012). The balance of the existing evidence, which suggest that
body dissatisfaction emerges as a causal factor at around the age of
13 years, led us to expect that body dissatisfaction at 7 or 9 years of
age would not predict eating disorder symptoms at age 12 for boys
or girls, acting only as a correlate (Allen et al., 2008; Ferreiro et al.,
2012; Parkinson et al., 2012) rather than as a risk factor, contrary to
the pattern seen in adolescent populations (Ferreiro et al., 2012).
2. Method
2.1. Participants
The data reported are from the Gateshead Millennium Study
(GMS) cohort in which mothers of infants born between June 1999
and May 2000 were approached to permit their infant(s) to join a
longitudinal study of feeding and growth (Parkinson, Wright, &
Drewett, 2007). All infants born to mothers resident in Gates-
head, an urban district in northeast England, in 34 pre-specified
weeks were eligible and 1029 infants (82%) joined the study.
Mothers were primarily from the white ethnic majority group (98%)
(Parkinson et al., 2010), which represented the ethnic composition
of the region at the time. The principal aim was to examine pro-
spectively the joint influence of infant feeding behaviour and
maternal characteristics on weight gain in a population birth
cohort. Full details are published (Parkinson et al., 2007, 2010).
The cohort has been followed up at intervals since recruitment;
at each follow-up assessment all children whose families had not
previously asked to leave the study were eligible to participate. For
the present study, assessments of the children were taken at three
follow ups: 6e8 years referred to as 7 years in this paper (median
7.4, range 6.4e8.4); 8e10 years referred to as 9 years (median 9.3,
range 8.4e10.2); and 11e13 years referred to as 12 years (median
12.5 range 11.6e13.3). The mean interval between the 7 and 9 year
assessments was 1.9 years (SD ¼ 0.2 years) and the mean time in-
terval between the 9 and 12 year assessments was 3.2 years (SD ¼
0.3 years). Mothers gave written consent for their own participation
and for the child to participate in the study. The children/adoles-
cents gave written assent.
Favourable ethical opinions were granted by Gateshead and
South Tyneside Local Research Ethics Committee (7 year follow up)
and by Newcastle University Ethics Committee (9 year and 12 year
follow ups).
2.2. Procedure
The data were collected by researchers trained in anthropom-
etry and the other study procedures. At each follow up the children
were visited in schools, or at home, to collect anthropometric and
questionnaire data. If necessary the researchers helped the children
with comprehension of the questionnaires, using the standardised
study assessment protocol.
2.3. Measures
2.3.1. Eating disorder symptoms and dietary restraint
i) The Dutch Eating Behaviour Questionnaire child version
(DEBQ-C) (van Strien & Oosterveld, 2008) was adapted for 7e12
year olds from the Dutch Eating Behaviour Questionnaire (DEBQ)
(van Strien & Oosterveld, 2008; van Strien, Frijters, Bergers, &
Defares, 1986). The cohort completed the seven-item Restraint
subscale at 7 years old. It assesses the tendency to eat reduced
amounts in order to lose or maintain weight. Participants respond
‘no’, ‘sometimes’ or ‘yes’ to each item, scoring 1, 2 or 3, with higher
scores indicating greater dietary restraint. The subscale has estab-
lished reliability (a ¼ 0.8) and adequate construct validity in boys
and girls aged 7e12 years (van Strien & Oosterveld, 2008). In the
current cohort, a ¼ 0.7 at the 7 year follow up assessment.
ii) The Children's Eating Attitudes Test (ChEAT) (Maloney,
McGuire, & Daniels, 1988), a modified version of the adult Eating
Attitudes Test (Garner & Garfinkel, 1979; Garner, Olmsted, Bohr, &
Garfinkel, 1982), was completed by the cohort at 9 and 12 years of
age. The ChEAT is a 26-item measure of dimensional eating disorder
symptoms including concerns about being overweight, binging and
purging, and food pre-occupation. Items are scored between 1
(never) and 6 (always); the three most symptomatic responses are
scored 1, 2 and 3 respectively, whilst the other three responses are
scored zero. The scale has satisfactory test-retest reliability (r ¼ 0.8)
and internal consistency of a ¼ 0.9 in boys and girls aged 7e12
years (Maloney et al., 1988; Smolak & Levine, 1994). Higher scores
indicate greater symptomatology. Participants completed the
ChEAT at 9 years and 12 years old. In the current cohort, a ¼ 0.8 at 9
years and a ¼ 0.8 at 12 years of age.
2.3.2. Body image
i) The Children's Body Image Scale (CBIS) (Truby & Paxton, 2002,
2008) consists of photographic figures of pre-pubescent children,
seven each of boys and girls ranging from very thin to obese. The
CBIS scale asks: ‘Looking at the pictures below, which body shape
looks most like your own?’ (perceived figure); and ‘Looking at the
same pictures, which body shape would you most like to have?’
(preferred figure). The CBIS categories were assigned scores of 1e7
to give an ordered numerical scale of increasing size. Body dissat-
isfaction was calculated by subtracting the perceived figure from
the preferred figure to produce a directional discrepancy score,
where a negative score indicated a preference for a smaller body
than one's own and a positive score indicated a preference for a
larger figure (Truby & Paxton, 2002). The scale demonstrates
acceptable construct validity and test-retest reliability in boys and
girls aged 7e11 years (r ¼ 0.7). The cohort completed the CBIS at 7
years and 9 years of age.
ii) The Impact of Weight on Quality of Life-Kids (IWQOLeKids)
assesses self-perceptions of weight-specific quality of life across the
entire weight spectrum for children and adolescents aged 11e19
years (Kolotkin et al., 2006). The scale is comprised of 4 sub-scales,
including a 9-item body esteem subscale that assesses evaluative
E.H. Evans et al. / Appetite 108 (2017) 12e20
14
 satisfaction with one's physical body. Respondents report the fre-
quency with which they experience a given negative body-related
cognition on a scale from 1 (always) to 5 (never). The subscale
provides a reliable (a ¼ 0.9) and valid measure of body esteem in
overweight and non-overweight boys and girls aged 11e19 years
and excellent test-retest reliability of r ¼ 0.9 (Kolotkin et al., 2006;
Modi & Zeller, 2011). The cohort completed the IWQOL-Kids at 12
years of age, and an internal reliability (Cronbach's a) of 0.9 was
obtained.
The CBIS is unsuitable for 12-year-olds because the figures de-
pict pre-pubertal children, so the age-appropriate IWQOL-Kids
body esteem sub-scale was selected for the 12 year follow-up
assessment. Although these scales differ in format, both capture
global attitudinal body dissatisfaction (as opposed to other di-
mensions of body image). They are referred to as body dissatis-
faction (CBIS) and body esteem (IWQOL-Kids) in the analyses to
distinguish between the different measures used. Lower/more
negative scores on both the CBIS and the IWQOL-Kids scale indicate
greater body dissatisfaction (and thus lower body esteem).
2.3.3. Depressive symptoms
The Child Depression Inventory e Short Form (CDI-S) (Kovacs,
1992) is a simplified version of the Beck Depression Inventory
(Beck, Ward, Mendelson, Mock, & Erbaugh, 1961). It was used to
measure depressive symptoms at 12 years. It consists of 10 items,
each comprising three statements about the respondent's feelings in
the preceding two weeks from which one is selected per item
(scored 0, 1, or 2). A higher total score, calculated by summing each
item's score, indicates greater symptomatology. The CDI-S has a
satisfactory internal consistency of 0.8 in its validation sample of
boys and girls aged 7e17 years (Kovacs, 1992). The internal consis-
tency of the scale in the current sample was a ¼ 0.8 at 12 years of age.
2.3.4. Body measurements
Weight and height were measured by the study researchers at 7
years, 9 years and 12 years of age, using equipment purchased from
Chasmors, London. Weight was measured to 0.1 kg using Tanita
scales TBF-300MA, and height was measured to 0.1 cm with the
head in the Frankfurt plane using a Leicester portable height
measure. On each assessment occasion, measurements were taken
at least twice, until two consistent values were obtained (data
points within 0.1 kg of each other for weight and within 1 cm of
each other for height). The mean value of the two measurements
for weight and for height was calculated. The child's body mass
index (BMI) (weight[kg]/height[m]2) was calculated from the
averaged height and weight measurements. BMI z-scores for age
were calculated using data from the UK90 reference dataset (Cole,
Freeman, & Preece, 1995).
2.3.5. Socio-economic status
Socio-economic status measures were collected from the
mother at recruitment shortly after birth. The family's postcode
was transformed into the Townsend deprivation score (Townsend,
Phillimore, & Beattie, 1988). We used the Townsend deprivation
score as an index of SES when evaluating the effect of attrition at 12
years (from the original cohort) upon the representativeness of the
cohort.
2.4. Statistical methods
Data analysis was conducted on all cases for whom an eating
disorder symptom score at 12 years was obtained. In total, 525
participants were assessed at the 12 year follow up, and eating
disorder symptom scores were available for 516 of these (<2%
missing data).
To examine the representativeness of the cohort in the light of
attrition, the current cohort composition was compared to the
original cohort composition according to Townsend deprivation
index quintile (Table 1).
Next, descriptive statistics were calculated for all measured
variables, the proportion of missing data for each variable was
recorded and initial comparisons of boys' and girls’ characteristics
were made (Table 2). Anthropometric and scale data were not
normally distributed, so the median and the semi-interquartile
range was used to summarise them, and non-parametric methods
(Mann-Whitney U test) were used to compare values for boys and
girls.
The first aim of the study was to examine within-time associa-
tions between eating disorder symptoms (12y) and putative cor-
relates; correlations (Spearman's rho) were calculated separately
for boys and girls (Table 3). A significance threshold of p � 0.005
was applied to the data in Tables 2 and 3 to correct for multiple
comparisons. Significant correlates of eating disorder symptoms
(12y) were used in the subsequent multivariate regressions for boys
and girls.
The second aim of the study was to develop multivariate pre-
dictive
models for eating disorder
symptoms with
variables
measured both within and across-time, using OLS linear regression.
Disordered eating symptoms (12y) were regressed, separately for
boys and girls, on variables significant in the preceding correlation
analyses (Table 4). SPSS version 21 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA) was
used for statistical analysis.
3. Results
3.1. Sample attrition
The original sample comprised a total of 1011 mothers and it
was comparable with the northeast region of England in terms of
socio-economic deprivation apart from slight under-representation
of the most affluent quintile (Table 1). Overall, non-participation
has been higher in the least affluent families than in the most
affluent. This means that by 12 years the distribution across all the
deprivation quintiles was fairly even and the sample is represen-
tative of the north of England.
3.2. Descriptive statistics
Eating disorder symptom data were collected from 516 adoles-
cents (254 boys and 262 girls) at the 12 year follow-up; 4.8% were
11 years old, 89.8% were 12 years old and 5.4% were 13 years old.
Descriptive data are shown by sex at each follow up assessment
(Table 2). The proportion of complete data for each variable ranged

 from 79 to 83% at age 7 years to 99e100% at 12 years.
At 12 years girls had significantly higher depressive symptom
scores than boys and they had significantly higher body dissatis-
faction than boys at 7, 9 and 12 years of age. There was no signifi-
cant difference between boys and girls on the eating disorder
symptom scores at either 9 or 12 years; however the scores overall
at 9 years were significantly higher than at 12 years (Z ¼ 10.62,
p < 0.001). Overall, for both girls and boys, children's BMI z-scores
at 9 years were higher than those at 7 years (c2 ¼ 28.4, p < 0.0001),
and BMI z-scores at 12 years were higher than those at 9 years
(c2 ¼ 13.3, p < 0.0001) i.e. their relative adiposity increased at each
time-point.
3.3. Within-time associations among 12 year eating disorder
symptoms and putative correlates
Table 3 shows a zero-order non-parametric correlation matrix
for study variables at 12, 9 and 7 years of age. For boys, eating
disorder symptoms at age 12 were inversely associated with body
esteem at age 12 and directly associated with eating disorder
symptoms at age 9 and dietary restraint at age 7. For girls, eating
disorder symptoms at age 12 were directly associated with
depressive symptoms and BMI at age 12, inversely associated with
body esteem at age 12 and directly associated with eating disorder
symptoms at age 9.
Variables with a significant correlational relationship with
eating disorder symptoms at 12 years were entered into separate
multiple regressions for boys and girls (Table 4). Variables entered
into the boys' model were dietary restraint (7y), previous eating
disorder symptoms (9y) and body esteem (12y). Variables entered
into the girls’ model were previous eating disorder symptoms (9y),
BMI (12y), depressive symptoms (12y) and body esteem (12y).
3.4. Prospective predictors and correlates of eating disorder
symptoms at 12 years of age
To examine the combined effects of the aforementioned vari-
ables upon eating disorder symptoms at 12 years, OLS linear
regression analyses were run separately for boys and girls. The
resultant regression coefficients are shown in Table 4.
For boys, higher dietary restraint (7y), higher eating disorder
symptoms (9y) and lower body esteem (12y) all accounted for
significant variance in eating disorder symptoms at 12 years.
For
girls,
higher
eating
disorder
symptoms
(9y),
higher
depression (12 y) and lower body esteem (12y) all accounted for
variance in eating disorder symptoms at 12 years of age, but BMI
(12y) did not. The initial contribution of BMI (12y) to variance in
eating disorder symptoms (12y; b ¼ 0.15, p ¼ 0.001) was fully
cancelled out by the addition of body esteem (12y) to the model,
rendering the contribution of BMI non-significant.
The final regression model accounted for a greater proportion of
variance in eating disorder symptoms at 12 years of age in girls
(R2 ¼ 0.49) than in boys (R2 ¼ 0.26).
3.5. Multicollinearity
To examine the extent to which the regression models evi-
denced multicollinearity, tolerance and variance inflation factor
(VIF) scores were inspected for all variables in the final models. In
the boys' model, tolerance values ranged from 0.93 to 0.95 and VIF
values ranged from 1.05 to 1.08, suggesting that multicollinearity
was not a concern. In the girls' model, tolerance values ranged from
0.49 to 0.86 and VIF values ranged from 1.17 to 2.03. The relation-
ship between BMI (12y) and body esteem (12y), as shown in
Table 3, likely accounts for these less optimal collinearity statistics,
even though the latter statistics are within the acceptable range
(O'Brien, 2007). Because BMI (12y) did not account for significant
variance in girls' eating disorder symptoms, its removal from the
model reduced the range of tolerance values without reducing the
R2 value at all. The revised range for VIF was from 0.63 to 0.86 and,
for tolerance, from 1.15 to 1.66.
4. Discussion
This study shows that higher eating disorder symptoms at 9
years significantly predicted higher eating disorder symptoms at 12
years for both boys and girls, whilst greater dietary restraint at 7
years was a significant predictor for boys. Lower 12 year body
esteem (for boys and girls) and higher 12 year depressive symp-
toms (for girls) were also associated with higher 12 year eating
disorder symptoms. A number of variables, which had been
included based on adult risk factors for disordered eating, did not
function as predictors of eating disorder symptoms, notably pre-
vious body dissatisfaction and concurrent BMI. Low body esteem
appeared to have developed alongside eating disorder symptoms
rather than acting as a predictor. Girls’ body esteem at 12 years fully
accounted for the initially observed univariate relationship be-
tween 12 year BMI and eating disorder symptoms.
Initial eating disorder symptom score at 9 years of age was the
strongest predictor of subsequent eating disorder symptoms, a
finding consistent with the overwhelming majority of previous
studies of children and young adolescents (Keel et al., 1997;
Wichstrøm, 2000). Such attitudes are moderately stable over
time, appearing to belie assertions that children's eating disorder
symptoms are temporally and conceptually unstable (Micali &
House, 2011). This finding reinforces the importance of targeting
children with higher eating disorder symptoms in preadolescence
for possible intervention before they enter adolescence itself.
In keeping with initial hypotheses and previous research (Allen
et al., 2008; Gardner et al., 2000; Keel et al., 1997; Parkinson et al.,
2012), prior body dissatisfaction did not prospectively predict
higher eating disorder symptoms in this cohort, whereas concur-
rent body esteem at 12 years old did. This provides additional
weight to the premise that body dissatisfaction is not a reliable
causal risk factor for eating disorder symptoms in childhood. The
significant associations between lower body esteem and higher
eating disorder symptoms at 12 years of age for both boys and girls
suggest that body dissatisfaction may co-develop with eating dis-
order symptoms in preadolescence rather than the former pre-
ceding the latter. Similar prospective findings have been obtained
previously (Smolak, 2009; Wertheim, Paxton, & Blaney, 2009)
although only one study e involving an older sample - gathered
data over a comparable 6-year period (Ferreiro et al., 2012).
A clear sex difference was found in this cohort in depressive
symptoms and their association with eating disorder symptoms at
age 12; concurrent depressive symptom scores were a highly sig-
nificant correlate of higher eating disorder symptoms at 12 years of
age in girls but not boys. This fits with previous findings that sex
differences in links between depressive and disordered eating
symptoms emerge around the age of 13 years (Ferreiro et al. 2012).
It has been proposed that at this age, girls but not boys are more
likely to use disordered eating behaviours to relieve depressive
symptoms and, reciprocally, disordered eating gives rise to negative
self-evaluations and depressed affect (Beato-Fern�
andez et al.,
2007). In the current study, boys’ depressive symptom scores
were low and showed little variance; this may also explain the
absence of a significant effect in the predictive model.
Conversely, dietary restraint at 7 years directly predicted sub-
sequent eating disorder symptoms at 12 years for boys but not girls,
despite predicting eating disorder symptoms for children of both
E.H. Evans et al. / Appetite 108 (2017) 12e20
17
 sexes at the earlier 9 year follow up (Parkinson et al., 2012). This
suggests that early dietary restraint may play a more pivotal role in
developing eating disorder symptoms in boys than girls. Notably,
however, the final regression model for girls accounted for almost
twice as much variance in eating disorder symptoms as the model
for boys, suggesting that additional, untested predictive variables
may have been missing from the boys' model. Such variables may
include the pursuit of muscularity and athletic internalisation,
which reflect the male ideal body more closely than the ‘thin ideal’
(Rodgers, Ganchou, Franko, & Chabrol, 2012). However, the overall
proportion of variance accounted for by the predictive models for
boys and girls (26% vs 49% respectively) compares favourably to
that of previous studies with slightly older children, using similar
variables (Ferreiro et al., 2012). These findings suggest that pre-
ventative measures against both depression and disordered eating
need to take into account the sex differences on internalising
symptoms found in this cohort and previously.
The dual pathway model, based on research with older pop-
ulations, suggests that dietary restraint and depression provide two
routes via which body dissatisfaction is enacted through behav-
ioural and cognitive symptoms of disordered eating (Stice & Agras,
1998). In the current sample, this was not found to be the case:
dietary restraint acted as a predictor of eating disorder symptoms
in boys but not girls, whilst depressive symptoms had an effect on
girls' eating disorder symptoms but not boys'. Similar relationships
have been found before in adolescent populations, in relation to
specific subsets of eating disorder symptoms, but patterns of sex
differences vary (Field et al.,1999; Ricciardelli & McCabe, 2001). It is
plausible that these variables act as specific risk factors at different
points throughout childhood and adolescence, and that their in-
fluence may, to some extent, depend upon the child's sex.
Regarding gender differences in levels of eating disorder
symptoms, older adolescents' eating disorder symptoms are typi-
cally higher in girls than boys (Ferreiro et al., 2014). In this cohort at
9 years, boys' eating disorder symptoms exceeded girls' (Parkinson
et al., 2012) whereas at 12 years we have found no significant dif-
ference between their scores. This finding is consistent with pre-
vious research in which gender differences emerged around 13
years of age (Ferreiro et al., 2012; Rolland, Farnill, & Griffiths, 1997).
Over the time between the 9 and 12 year assessments, both girls'
and boys’ eating disorder symptom scores decreased, a trend seen
in several similar studies (e.g., Combs et al., 2012). Others have
noted age-related increases in girls but not boys (Gardner et al.,
2000) or found age-related declines in boys but not girls (Ferreiro
et al., 2011, 2014).
Evidence in this field increasingly suggests that preadolescent
psychological variables provide a critical context within which the
seismic changes of puberty occur. Yet there remains a lack of lon-
gitudinal research into the childhood antecedents of eating disor-
der symptoms in early adolescence, despite the physical and
psychological developmental risks these phenomena pose. Our
research presents a picture of these antecedents at 12 years of age,
alongside within-time correlates, using data gathered at 7 years, 9
and 12 years (Parkinson et al., 2012). It benefits from a unique,
representative UK population-based birth cohort of boys and girls,
making the findings generalisable to similar populations. It focuses
on children aged 7e12 years of age, a key developmental window
for understanding eating psychopathology (Davison et al., 2003;
Smolak, 2004, 2009; Wertheim et al., 2009). Indeed, a recent re-
view highlighted the importance of longitudinal research, involving
boys, into causal risk factors for sub-syndromal disordered eating
over the preadolescent period: the current study meets all of these
criteria (Culbert et al., 2015). No previous study has drawn on data
from three time-points spanning preadolescence, spaced over six
years, addressing this particular constellation of empirically-
justifiable risk factors. However, the current study has several
limitations. First, sample attrition may have introduced biases over
time,
although
lower
socio-economic
families
were
over-
represented in the initial cohort, and attrition has been higher in
such families, making the remaining cohort more representative
over time (Parkinson et al., 2010). The current sample therefore
remains socially diverse and representative of the north of England.
Second, use of self-report instruments, specifically depressive
symptoms and eating disorder symptoms, may have led to under or
over-reporting of symptoms; this is a particular hazard with young
children (Erickson & Gerstle, 2007). Third, key putative sociocul-
tural predictors of eating disorder symptoms e such as thin-ideal
internalisation and perceived pressure to be thin e were not
measured (Evans et al., 2013); it is possible that such unmeasured
latent variables account for some of the findings.
Future research should seek to theoretically model the re-
lationships among intrapersonal predictors and correlates of
disordered eating, along sociocultural and biological factors over
the developmental course of pre- and early-adolescence. This could
be
operationalised
through
a
framework
such
as
the
bio-
psychosocial model, and would enable a more nuanced under-
standing of developmental ‘cause’ in this context (Rodgers et al.,
2014). A key question to address will be whether body dissatis-
faction functions as a causal risk factor in childhood for subsequent
eating disorder symptoms. Evidence from the current study and
others (e.g., Ferreiro et al., 2012) suggests not. However, to
conclusively answer this question, additional studies with similar
preadolescent age groups are needed which adopt Stice’s (2002)
recommendations to adjust for initial levels of the outcome vari-
able (and, preferably, subsequent levels of the predictor variable)
when attempting to ascertain temporal precedence, as done in
studies of this cohort (Parkinson et al., 2012). Consideration should
also be given to different theoretical models for the development of
boys' eating disorder symptoms, since most existing models draw
on data from adolescent female samples and focus upon pressure to
be thin, rather than pressures towards hyper-muscularity as well
(Culbert et al., 2015).
In summary, the findings of this study add to the small but
growing body of prospective research into the emergence and
consolidation of eating disorder symptoms in children and young
adolescents, taking into account sex differences. Such research has
the potential to inform an understanding of factors that place
children at the greatest risk of disordered eating, paving the way
towards effective interventions (Pratt & Woolfenden, 2002). Our
findings strongly suggest the importance of early interventions
(before the age of 9 years) to address children's eating disorder
symptoms, since a higher level of symptoms at 9 years of age was
the strongest risk factor for a higher level of symptoms at 12 years
old. Efforts might be profitably aligned with interventions to pre-
vent excess weight gain and/or depression, given the behavioural
and possible aetiological overlap between these phenomena
(Haines & Neumark-Sztainer, 2006; Neumark-Sztainer, 2005). In
particular, our results indicate that a focus on childhood dietary
restraint in boys, on body dissatisfaction concurrent with eating
disorder symptoms for both boys and girls, and on concurrent
depression (in girls) in early adolescence may help identify children
with a phenotype suggestive of an elevated risk for future eating
disorder symptoms.
