Summary
Background Prognosis for women with abdominal aortic aneurysm might be worse than the prognosis for men. We 
aimed to systematically quantify the differences in outcomes between men and women being assessed for repair of 
intact abdominal aortic aneurysm using data from study periods after the year 2000.
Methods In these systematic reviews and meta-analysis, we identified studies (randomised, cohort, or cross-sectional) 
by searching MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, and grey literature published between Jan 1, 2005, and Sept 2, 2016, for 
two systematic reviews and Jan 1, 2009, and Sept 2, 2016, for one systematic review. Studies were included if they were 
of both men and women, with data presented for each sex separately, with abdominal aortic aneurysms being assessed 
for aneurysm repair by either endovascular repair (EVAR) or open repair. We conducted three reviews based on whether 
studies reported the proportion morphologically suitable (within manufacturers’ instructions for use) for EVAR (EVAR 
suitability review), non-intervention rates (non-intervention review), and 30-day mortality (operative mortality review) 
after intact aneurysm repair. Studies had to include at least 20 women (for the EVAR suitability review), 20 women (for 
the non-intervention review), and 50 women (for the operative mortality review). Studies were excluded if they were 
review articles, editorials, letters, or case reports. For the operative review, studies were also excluded if they only 
provided hazard ratios or only reported in-hospital mortality. We assessed the quality of the studies using the Newcastle–
Ottawa scoring system, and contacted authors for the provision of additional data if needed. We combined results across 
studies by random-effects meta-analysis. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42016043227.
Findings Five studies assessed the morphological eligibility for EVAR (1507 men, 400 women). The overall pooled 
proportion of women eligible (34%) for EVAR was lower than it was in men (54%; odds ratio [OR] 0·44, 95% CI 
0·32–0·62). Four single-centre studies reported non-intervention rates (1365 men, 247 women). The overall pooled 
non-intervention rates were higher in women (34%) than men (19%; OR 2·27, 95% CI 1·21–4·23). The review of 
30-day mortality included nine studies (52 018 men, 11 076 women). The overall pooled estimate for EVAR was higher 
in women (2·3%) than in men (1·4%; OR 1·67, 95% CI 1·38–2·04). The overall estimate for open repair also was 
higher in women (5·4%) than in men (2·8%; OR 1·76, 95% CI 1·35–2·30).
Interpretation Compared with men, a smaller proportion of women are eligible for EVAR, a higher proportion of 
women are not offered intervention, and operative mortality is much higher in women for both EVAR and open 
repair. The management of abdominal aortic aneurysm in women needs improvement.

Introduction
Treatment guidelines recommend that an abdominal 
aortic aneurysm in men should be considered for elective 
repair once the aneurysm has reached a diameter of 
5·5 cm, based on randomised trials that compared early 
elective repair with surveillance; these trials included 
only a small proportion of women.1 The decision to offer 
repair is made when the probable risk of rupture exceeds 
the risk of repair. Since the rate of rupture of small 
abdominal aortic aneurysm is four times higher in 
women than men at the same diameter,2 women are 
often considered for repair at diameters smaller than 
5·5 cm. Several studies3,4 have suggested that the 
prognosis of individuals with abdominal aortic aneurysm 
is worse for women than men, with the operative 
mortality following repair of intact aneurysm being 
higher in women than men.
To determine whether women, compared with men, 
are being offered adequate management of their intact 
aneurysms once they have reached the aneurysm 
diameter threshold for intervention, three pieces of 
crucial information are required: the proportion of each

sex morphologically suitable for endovascular aneurysm 
repair (EVAR; often preferred to open repair because it is 
minimally invasive and has a lower operative mortality), 
the proportion of each sex not offered repair (for which 
the suitability for EVAR might be influential), and the 
30-day mortality after elective aneurysm repair, either 
EVAR or open repair.
Randomised trials have reported that 30-day operative 
mortality for elective repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm 
is about three times higher after open repair than after 
EVAR,5 but again, women were poorly represented in 
these trials, perhaps partly because the early generation 
endografts were not suitable for most women.6,7 However, 
data from the large Medicare database in the USA 
suggest that this relative difference in 30-day mortality 
between EVAR and open repair is observed for both men 
and women, even though the absolute mortality was 
higher in women than men.8 An earlier systematic 
review,9 including studies published by July, 2009, 
showed that for elective open repairs the operative 
mortality (30 day or in-hospital) was 7·6% for women 
versus 5·1% for men. For EVAR, the mortality for women 
was 2·9% versus 1·5% for men, but included only 
1014 women undergoing EVAR.
The aim of this study was to quantify how the 
prognosis of women with abdominal aortic aneurysm 
compares with the prognosis in men. Therefore, we 
have systematically searched for contemporary evidence 
that describes the outcome of women with an intact 
abdominal aortic aneurysm of the size for which repair 
is considered in three sequential stages of the care 
pathway.
Methods
Search strategy and selection criteria
We identified relevant publications according to PRISMA 
guidelines, with the aim of systematically reviewing 
published data and grey literature published since 2005 
or 2009. First, we obtained data for the proportion of men 
and women with abdominal aortic aneurysm being 
assessed for aneurysm repair who were morphologically 
suitable for EVAR (EVAR suitability review); second, we 
obtained data for the proportion of men and women not 
offered aneurysm repair (non-intervention review); and 
finally, we obtained data for the elective operative (30 day) 
mortality in men and women after either EVAR or open 
repair reported since an earlier review9 was published in 
2010, (operative mortality review). A favourable ethical 
opinion for the systematic reviews done for the SWAN 
project was obtained from the West of Scotland REC 5 
(15/WS/0136).
For our reviews, we searched MEDLINE and Embase 
using a combination of controlled vocabulary (MeSH or 
Emtree; panel) terms and free-text terms in ProQuest 
Dialog (ProQuest, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) and restricting 
the search to data published since Jan 1, 2005 (EVAR 
suitability and non-intervention reviews), and since 
Jan 1, 2009 (operative mortality review, and therefore 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
An earlier systematic review (of articles published by July, 2009) 
showed that the operative mortality (defined as either 
in-hospital mortality or 30-day mortality) for elective 
abdominal aortic aneurysm open repairs was 7·6% in women 
versus 5·1% in men, and for endovascular repair the mortality in 
women was 2·9% versus 1·5% in men. To our knowledge, no 
previous systematic reviews have been done to compare women 
with men for either the morphological suitability for minimally 
invasive endovascular repair or for non-intervention rates.
Added value of this study
Operative mortality is not the first step in the care pathway of a 
patient with an abdominal aortic aneurysm of a size at which 
intervention is considered. First the patient must be assessed, 
including imaging, to evaluate the extent of their aneurysm 
and whether the aortic morphology might be suitable for 
endovascular repair. Often the next step is discussion of the 
patient at a multidisciplinary team meeting, where the decision 
to offer a repair and what type of repair is made. The gold 
standard for surgical reporting is 30-day mortality, and 
in-hospital mortality is often lower than 30-day mortality.
Our study, using international data, shows that at each step of 
the care pathway, women fare worse than men. Fewer women 
than men are deemed morphologically suitable for 
endovascular repair, more women than men are not offered an 
intervention, and the 30-day operative mortality is almost 
twice as high in women than in men for both endovascular and 
open repair. 
Implications of all the available evidence
Previously, abdominal aortic aneurysm has been considered as 
having a strong male preponderance and aneurysm screening is 
recommended for men, but not for women. Nowadays, women 
constitute a third of the patients presenting with the 
devastating complication of rupture. This presentation might 
result, in part, from only two-thirds of women with a large 
intact abdominal aortic aneurysm being offered a corrective 
intervention, which in turn, might be partly because their more 
complex aortic morphology renders them unsuitable for the 
lower risk endovascular repair. The default option of open repair 
is associated with an unacceptably high mortality, which might 
even be increasing with time, possibly because these are the 
most challenging cases in which endovascular repair was not 
feasible and the expertise with open repair is waning. The 
management of abdominal aortic aneurysm in women needs 
urgent improvement.

were not included in the 2010 review)9 for articles in 
English, French, or German. We also searched 
CENTRAL, ClinicaTrials.gov, Current Controlled Trials, 
and the National Research Register (UK) for details of 
ongoing or unpublished studies. We complemented 
searches by scanning reference lists of relevant articles, 
by direct enquiries to the companies’ marketing 
endografts for the EVAR suitability review, and by hand-
searching the abstracts of the 2015 and 2016 annual 
meetings 
of 
the 
Society 
for 
Vascular 
Surgery 
(North America) and the European Society for Vascular 
Surgery for all reviews. The final search date for all 
reviews, including a PubMed search, was Sept 2, 2016.
The panel shows the MeSH headings and key 
information for the three reviews, which were informed 
by the review protocols. For the EVAR suitability review, 
studies were included if they had more than 20 women, all 
or nearly all of the patients were considered for abdominal 
aortic aneurysm repair, morphological criteria for 
suitability were clearly defined with measurements or 
device instructions for use, and had CT with 1 mm slices 
and 3D reconstruction. For the non-intervention review, 
studies were included if they had more than 20 women, all 
or nearly all of the patients were considered for abdominal 
aortic aneurysm repair, and if it was a team decision 
whether repair offered. For the operative review, studies 
were included if they had a study period after the year 2000, 
and had more than 50 women. Studies were excluded if 
they were review articles, editorials, letters, or case reports, 
and if they only provided hazard ratios or only reported 
in-hospital mortality.
The appendix has the full search strategies and PRISMA 
flow diagrams. For duplicated data, the most recent or 
most comprehensive paper was included. Studies must 
have included both men and women, and presented data 
for each separately. Initial screening was based on the 
study title, followed by reviewing abstracts, after which 
full-text versions of the selected shortlist of documents 
were obtained and assessed for eligibility by two reviewers 
(RSvA and JTP for the EVAR suitability review and PU 
and JTP for the non-intervention review and operative 
mortality review). We recorded study design and setting, 
demographic and technical details, and potential biases 
(eg, ascertainment of outcomes). A summary checklist 
was completed for each study. When necessary, we 
contacted authors for the provision of additional data. 
Differences of opinion about study inclusion were 
resolved by discussion or a third reviewer. Two reviewers 
independently undertook quality scoring using the 
Newcastle–Ottawa score for cohort or cross-sectional 
studies.10
Data analysis
We made an estimate of the suitability for EVAR in men 
and women from each study, calculated as the number of 
each sex whose abdominal aortic aneurysm was suitable 
for EVAR (according to the manufacturers’ instructions 
for use) divided by the number who were assessed. We 
made an estimate of the non-intervention rate in men 
and women from each study, calculated as the number of 
each sex who were not offered repair divided by the 
number who were assessed.
95% CIs for percentages were calculated assuming 
normality on the log odds scale. Differences between 
women and men in each study were expressed as odds 
ratios (OR). For all reviews, we did random-effects meta-
analyses on the log odds (or log OR) scale using the 
method of DerSimonian and Laird;11 estimates were then 
transformed back to the probability (or OR) scale. We 
assessed heterogeneity using the I² statistic.12 Results are 
presented as forest plots. The reviews were registered in 
the PROSPERO database (CRD42016043227).
Role of the funding source
The funder of the study had no role in the study design, 
data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or 
writing of the report. The corresponding author had full 
access to all the data in the study and had final 
responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.
Results
After our search and evaluation (appendix), five papers 
based on five studies13–17 were eligible for inclusion in the 
meta-analysis regarding suitability for endovascular 
repair. Another study18 also included suitability for 
endovascular sealing technology, but used a selected 
population. The characteristics of the included studies 
are summarised in the appendix. One of these studies 
included more than 100 women, most studies were 
small, and the quality of these studies was assessed as 
fair. The criteria of morphological suitability for EVAR 
were different in each study; three studies13,15,16 included 
all the aneurysms diagnosed (including those not offered 
intervention), one study17 did not specify which patients

were being considered for EVAR, and one study14 only 
considered patients who had undergone elective repair. 
The largest study15 has published two further updates but 
neither provided sufficient information to merit 
inclusion in the review.19,20 Threshold abdominal aortic 
aneurysm diameter for inclusion ranged from 4 cm to 
5 cm. In total, information was available for 1507 men 
and 400 women in whom the suitability for EVAR ranged 
from 46% to 64% for men and from 25% to 47% for 
women. The overall pooled estimate of suitability for 
EVAR was 34% in women compared with 54% in men; 
both overall estimates had significant heterogeneity 
(figure 1A). For the proportion of women compared with 
men who were suitable for EVAR, the OR was 0·44 
(95% CI 0·32–0·62), with moderate heterogeneity 
(figure 1B).
Some 
studies 
considered 
relaxation 
of 
the 
morphological criteria for EVAR, which increased the 
proportion of women suitable for EVAR. For instance, in 
the largest study including 251 women,15 relaxation of the 
neck length to longer than 7·5 mm (from >15 mm) 
increased the suitability for EVAR from 63 (25%) women 
to 113 (45%) women. In one study,13 relaxation of the 
minimum iliac diameter from 7·5 mm or 8 mm to 6 mm 
increased the proportion of 41 women eligible for EVAR 
from 11 (27%) to 16 (39%). The type of endograft 
considered also affects the proportion of women suitable 
for EVAR. For example, in one excluded study18 of 
78 women that considered both conventional endografts 
and endovascular sealing, 32 (41%) women were suitable 
for the Gore Excluder graft (Gore Medical, Flagstaff, AZ, 
USA), but 61 (78%) would have been eligible for 
endovascular-sealing technology.18
The largest study15 investigated how suitability for 
EVAR declined with increasing aneurysm diameter, with 
almost no women being considered suitable for EVAR if 
their abdominal aortic aneurysm diameter cutoff
 
exceeded 6·5 cm compared with 30% of men being 
suitable. The other four studies13,14,16,17 provided few 
demographic or clinical details, so it was not possible to 
investigate how the suitability for EVAR in women might 
depend on age or other characteristics.
Our search and evaluation of non-intervention rates 
(appendix) yielded four publications, all from the UK, 
including two papers21,22 and two abstracts23,24 (both with 
additional information provided by the authors). All 
four studies were retrospective, with a total of 1365 men 
and 247 women; the studies were assessed as of fair 
quality (appendix). The overall results showed greater 
heterogeneity for men than for women and suggested that

a third (34%) of potentially eligible women were either not 
offered or refused abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. The 
proportion was about double the non-intervention rate in 
men (19%; OR 2·27, 95% CI 1·21–4·23; figure 2). The 
difference in non-intervention rates between men and 
women was highest for the earliest study22 at a specialist 
tertiary referral centre.
After our search and evaluation for studies on elective 
operative mortality (appendix), eight papers based on 
eight studies met the inclusion criteria.25–32 For one study31 
reporting from 1992 to 2012, the 30-day operative 
mortality data for the late era (2003–12) were obtained 
from the corresponding author. Similarly, the data for 
30-day mortality for the time period 2006–10 in the 
Swedish study28 were supplied by the corresponding 
author. All studies included consecutive patients 
undergoing EVAR or open repair, or both, for infrarenal 
abdominal aortic aneurysm between January, 2000, and 
March, 2015. One further study5 was identified and we 
excluded the few patients with repairs before 2000. 
Therefore, nine studies were included in the meta-
analysis. All nine studies provided data for intact 
infrarenal aneurysms only: two5,31 studies excluded 
symptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm. The English 
study32 was population-based, but for EVAR only. We 
excluded a similar study,33 including open repair but 
covering an earlier time period, because much of the 
30-day mortality was not aneurysm-related.
Full details of the included studies are summarised in 
the appendix. Three population-based studies28,30,32 were 
done in Sweden (765 women), the USA (5421 women), 
and the UK (2304 women). Other, mostly smaller, 
studies,25–27,29,31 based on either single centre or voluntary 
registries, were all from the USA and included 
2438 women. Individual patient data meta-analysis5 of 
four prospective randomised controlled trials contributed 
data for 148 women. These data gave a total of 
11 076 women operated on in nine separate studies, with 
an overall 30-day mortality of 2·31% (95% CI 1·99–2·68) 
after EVAR with no heterogeneity (figure 3A) and 5·37% 
(95% CI 4·18–6·88) after open repair with slight 
heterogeneity (figure 4A). These data contrast with the 
more heterogeneous results for a much larger cohort of 
52 018 men operated on in these same studies with an 
overall 30-day mortality of 1·37% (95% CI 1·12–1·68) 
after EVAR and 2·82% (95% CI 1·88–4·22) after open 
repair (figures 3A, 4A). The Medicare study30 provided 
the most data for the results of open repair. When this 
study was removed from the meta-analysis, the change in 
30-day mortality was little: 4·72% for women (95% CI

3·83–5·82) and 2·50% for men (1·76–3·55). Similarly 
for EVAR, after exclusion of the two largest studies,30,32 
the change in 30-day mortality was little: 2·55% for 
women (95% CI 1·83–3·55) and 1·24% for men 
(0·81–1·89).
In the nine included studies, 30-day mortality was 
significantly higher in women than in men for both types 
of repair: the overall OR for EVAR was 1·67 (95% CI 
1·38–2·04) and for open repair 1·76 (1·35–2·30; 
figures 3B, 4B). Confounding factors such as age, 
abdominal aortic aneurysm diameter, number of 
symptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysms included, and 
comorbidities were reported inconsistently, but the 
adjusted OR continued to show a higher mortality in 
women of almost double (table); only three studies 
reported separately for EVAR and open repair.
Discussion
Prognosis of abdominal aortic aneurysm is often regarded 
as worse in women than men,3,4 with adverse factors likely 
to include the older age of women, and higher morbidity 
and mortality after elective aneurysm repair. The data from 
our systematic review do not suggest that the proportion of 
women morphologically suitable for EVAR has improved 
since earlier this century.6,7 However, the operative 
mortality in both men and women has fallen substantially 
since a 2010 systematic review,9 particularly for open repair; 
although 30-day operative mortality remains almost twice 
as high in women as in men. Some of the reduction in 
operative mortality in women might have come at the 
expense of the high proportion of women (a third) who are 
assigned to a non-intervention policy; although, the 
literature on non-intervention policy remains sparse.

Surgical registries and national databases do not 
record or report the numbers of patients with abdominal 
aortic aneurysm who either are morphologically suitable 
for EVAR or denied elective repair. The only non-
intervention data identified came from four single 
centres in the UK, with decisions about repair being 
made at a multidisciplinary team meeting: presumably 
the 
women 
not 
offered 
repair 
had 
extensive 
comorbidities and had a high risk of early postoperative 
death. Only one of these series21 has provided detailed 
follow-up data for those initially assigned to a non-
intervention policy. The study showed that after 3 years, 
only about a third of these patients remained alive and 
that 37% had died of rupture. Similarly, in the other full 
paper,22 only 35% of non-intervention patients were 
alive at 2 years.

repair and is associated with a third to half of the 30-day

mortality, the rate of morphological eligibility for EVAR is 
likely to effect the non-intervention rates for elective 
abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery. In 2001, using early-
generation endografts, one study7 reported that only 39% 
of women versus 60% of men were morphologically 
eligible for EVAR. Our systematic review shows no 
improvement, with an overall estimate of 34% of women 
being morphologically suitable for EVAR, based on the 
manufacturers’ instructions for use. The principal 
morphological criteria rendering women unsuitable for 
EVAR include both short and angulated proximal 
aneurysm necks and the dimensions of the access iliac 
arteries. Many endovascular specialists are willing to relax 
the strict requirements of the instructions for use,34 and 
adjunct techniques do exist, such as iliac conduits, to use 
EVAR in narrow or heavily calcified iliac arteries. 
Nowadays, lower profile devices suitable for smaller access 
vessels and devices that can adapt to shorter and more 
angulated necks are available. Potentially, this availability 
should allow more women to be treated by EVAR. 
However, summary information from the Characterization 
of Human Aortic Anatomy Project20 for 2012–13 lower 
profile devices (including Aorfix [Lombard Medical, 
Didcot, UK], Endurant II [Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, 
USA], and Ovation [Endologix, Irvine, CA, USA]) suggests 
that only 40% of women remain suitable for EVAR based 
on the instructions for use. Other information from this 
project indicates that in women older than 80 years, EVAR 
eligibility is particularly low (29%).19 No endografts have 
been designed specifically for women, but preliminary 
data suggest that the endovascular-sealing technology is 
the approach most likely to increase the proportion of 
women suitable for endovascular repair.18
A comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis9 
showing the sex-specific differences in mortality after 
either EVAR or open repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm 
was published in 2010. This review included publications 
from 1995 to July, 2009, for operative mortality (either 
30-day or in-hospital mortality; in-hospital mortality is 
usually lower than 30-day mortality). Operative mortality 
was higher in women than in men (overall OR for EVAR 
2·51, 95% CI 1·72–3·69 vs OR for open repair 1·50, 
1·33–1·69). The results were dominated by a 20-year 
review (1980–2000) from the USA with 81 384 women35 
and contained few data for patients who underwent 
EVAR. By contrast, we focused on 30-day mortality only 
in studies published since Jan 1, 2009, which included 
more data for EVAR. Again the mortality for both EVAR 
and open repair was almost twice as high in women as in 
men, with mortality for EVAR being much lower than for 
open repair. Overall 30-day mortality for EVAR was 2·3% 
and for open repair was 5·4% for women versus 1·4% for 
EVAR and 2·8% for open repair in men. Although the 
overall mortality has decreased since the 2010 systematic 
review, the OR for women versus men has changed little. 
The mortality following open repair in women appears to 
be unacceptably high.
Since our analysis of 30-day mortality, we have become 
aware of two sources of recent data, covering the period 
2011–14. A retrospective cohort study36 of 6661 patients 
from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical 
Quality Improvement Program has shown that, for either 
EVAR or open repair of intact abdominal aortic aneurysm, 
30-day mortality in women is double that of men and 
women have a 30% increase in complication rate, even 
after adjustment for age and aneurysm diameter: 
mortality in women was 2·9% for EVAR and 8·2% for 
open repair versus 1·1% for EVAR and 4·0% for open 
repair in men. Analysis of the similar size English 
administrative dataset (Hospital Episode Statistics) 
showed that 30-day mortality for elective admissions was 
2·3% for EVAR and 7·0% for open repair in women 
versus 1·4% for EVAR and 4·1% for open repair in men 
(Michaels J A, University of Sheffield, personal 
communication). The apparent recent increase in 
mortality for open repairs might be explained by the 
decreasing proportion of operations undertaken as open 
repairs, which diminishes expertise at a time when the 
remaining open repairs are likely to be the most 
technically challenging cases.
These studies have several limitations. First and 
foremost, factors that might confound the comparison of 
men and women, such as age, aneurysm diameter, and 
comorbidities, were inconsistently reported. Operative 
mortality is known to increase with age, and women 
appear to develop clinically relevant aneurysms at an 
older age than men.37,38 Since prevalence increases rapidly 
with age, especially in women,39 this factor is an 
important consideration. Nevertheless, when adjusted 
data were available, the much higher 30-day mortality in 
women remained. Second, there was a varying amount 
of heterogeneity in the meta-analyses, but the results for 
all outcomes consistently showed sex-specific differences. 
Third, it can take several years for publications to appear 
in print, which might cover several generations of 
endografts and experience for EVAR, so obtaining 
contemporary data is challenging. Fourth, the patients 
selected for EVAR and open repair in the various studies 
are likely to be different, including differences in aortic 
morphology, which might affect mortality from both 
EVAR and open repair. Particularly when used outside 
the instructions for use, the complication, re-intervention, 
and mortality for EVAR could all increase.34,40 Finally, a 
relative paucity of data is available about the number of 
women versus men either eligible for EVAR or not 
considered for any intervention, which underscores the 
importance of reporting primary data by sex.41
Moreover, our review has several strengths. All the 
studies included in this series had to include both men 
and women and present the data for each separately, so 
that men and women from the same population and the 
same time period are compared in each study. 
Furthermore, we presented results as OR and compared 
women with men in each study (and overall), since these 
 Articles
2490 
www.thelancet.com   Vol 389   June 24, 2017
OR should be less susceptible to heterogeneity than the 
results for men and women separately.
In summary, the results of these reviews indicate that 
the prognosis of women with abdominal aortic aneurysm 
is worse than that of men; although, we have not 
considered the management of cardiovascular risk (often 
worse in women),42,43 complications after repair, and 
longer term quality or length of life. Women have smaller 
aortas than men,44 and perhaps if a smaller threshold for 
both diagnosis and intervention were introduced, 
compared with those recommended for men, women 
might have a better chance of being offered and surviving 
intervention at a younger age. Given the relatively high 
mortality following open abdominal aortic aneurysm 
repair in women, it would seem to be crucial either to 
design an endograft for women or to accept that most 
women need to be referred to centres that either offer 
endovascular sealing technology or are specialists in open 
repair. Such measures might see an improved prognosis 
for women.
