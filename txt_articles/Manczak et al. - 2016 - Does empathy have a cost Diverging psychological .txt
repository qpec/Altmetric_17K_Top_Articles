Abstract
Objective—Parental empathy is associated with a host of beneficial psychosocial outcomes for 
children. However, less is known about the effects of being empathic for parents. The current 
study tested the hypothesis that, although parental empathy may be beneficial to children both 
psychologically and physiologically, it may take a physiological toll on parents.
Methods—The current study examined psychological and physiological correlates of parental 
empathy in 247 parent-adolescent dyads. During a baseline laboratory visit, parents and 
adolescents provide blood samples from which markers of systemic inflammation, including 
interleukin 1-ra, interleukin 6,and C-reactive protein, were assayed. Parents completed self-report 
questionnaires of empathy, well-being, and self-esteem, and also reported on their child's emotion 
regulation. Following the laboratory visit, adolescents completed two weeks of daily diary 
reporting on their emotion regulation abilities.
Results—In adolescents, parental empathy was significantly associated with both better emotion 
regulation and with less systemic inflammation. For parents, being empathic was associated with 
greater self-esteem and purpose in life, but also with higher systemic inflammation.
Conclusions—These findings reinforce the importance of simultaneously considering both 
psychological and physical health-related effects of psychosocial traits and suggests that empathy 
may have diverging effects across providers and recipients of empathy.

 McNally, 1993). However, is it possible that empathy comes at a cost to parents? The 
current study tests the hypothesis that although parental empathy may be beneficial to 
children, and may also promote parents’ psychological well-being, ongoing efforts to engage 
in empathy may take a physiological toll on parents.
Receiving Parental Empathy
Empathy refers to the trait tendencies of a person to both affectively experience emotions of 
concern at the suffering of others and to cognitively adopt the perspective of another (Davis, 
1983). Parents who are better able to empathize with their children provide more attuned 
caregiving (Dix, 1992; Soenens, Duriez, Vansteenkiste, & Goossens, 2007) and show more 
harmonious interactions characterized by greater shared positive affect and mutual 
responsiveness (Kochanska, 1997). Empathic parenting is thought to help children develop 
effective emotion regulation skills (Field, 1994), allowing children to develop greater 
mastery of their own emotions through parents’ scaffolding of children's experiences. In 
turn, children with more empathic parents show lower internalizing (e.g., less depression) 
and lower externalizing (e.g., less aggression) symptoms, as well as greater empathy 
themselves (Eisenberg, Fabes, Schaller, Carlo, & Miller, 1991; Feshbach, 1987), with 
effects of empathy apparent in youths ranging from young children to adolescents (Soenens 
et al., 2007; Strayer & Roberts, 2004).
Parental empathy may also contribute to better physiological profiles in children. 
Specifically, previous work has demonstrated that psychosocial characteristics of the family 
environment relate to offspring's chronic inflammation. For example, individuals who grow 
up in harsh family environments, such as those characterized by risky parenting behaviors 
and low warmth, display more chronic, low-grade inflammation, including elevations in 
interleukin 6 and C-reactive protein (G. E. Miller & Chen, 2010; Taylor, Lehman, Kiefe, & 
Seeman, 2006). In addition, if individuals who grow up under family adversity (e.g., low 
socioeconomic status) also report high levels of parental warmth in childhood, they display 
less proinflammatory signaling and reduced multisystem biological risk in adulthood 
(Carroll et al., 2013; E. Chen, Miller, Kobor, & Cole, 2010). One possibility is that the 
availability of support and comfort from parents helps to calibrate children's biological stress 
response systems in beneficial ways (Boyce & Ellis, 2005).
Providing Parental Empathy
What are less well established are the effects of being an empathic provider. 
Psychologically, being empathic may make individuals feel good about themselves, much as 
helping others is associated with better psychological well-being (Greenfield & Marks, 
2004; Lum & Lightfoot, 2005; Weinstein & Ryan, 2010). These exhibitions of empathy may 
reinforce images that parents hold of themselves as caring individuals and competent, 
effective parents (Caprara, Alessandri, & Eisenberg, 2012; Jones & Prinz, 2005). In turn, 
this type of image may encourage a sense of satisfaction and pride (Coleman & Karraker, 
2000; Ryff, Lee, Essex, & Schmutte, 1994).
Regarding the physiological correlates of providing empathy: on the one hand, it is possible 
that empathy— similar to the effects of other positive traits such as psychological well-being

 (e.g. Friedman, Hayney, Love, Singer, & Ryff, 2007; Ryff, Singer, & Dienberg Love, 2004)
—may relate to lower levels of chronic inflammation. On the other hand, however, several 
converging lines of research support the possibility that providing empathy can have costs. 
First, the effort involved in consistently expressing empathy toward others may involve 
acting in a manner that elevates physiological reactivity. Specifically, responding 
empathically often necessitates transcending one's own point of view and being nonreactive 
to whatever is encountered (Larson & Yao, 2005). To accomplish this, parents may suppress 
their own feelings in order to help their children feel safe or understood. Emotional 
suppression is known to increase physiological responses to stressors (Gross, 1998; Gross & 
Levenson, 1993). In addition, individuals who engage in more frequent emotional 
suppression show higher levels of inflammation, indexed by C-reactive protein (Appleton et 
al., 2013). Second, a separate line of research suggests that certain positive psychological 
traits (e.g., self-competence) can sometimes have physiological costs. For example, Brody et 
al. (2013) showed that among youths living under adverse circumstances, ongoing high self-
regulation (psychosocial competence) protected them from behavior problems and substance 
use years later, but at the same time, led to higher levels of wear and tear on their 
physiological systems. Similarly, persistence towards different personal goals has been 
shown to longitudinally predict greater systemic inflammation (Miller & Wrosch, 2007). 
Thus positive psychological traits can sometimes be beneficial in certain regards but costly 
in others. In similar ways, acting empathically may require parents to expend sustained 
psychological effort that is physiologically taxing.
The Current Study
The current study sought to test the hypothesis that parental empathy, while beneficial to 
adolescents, would come at a physiological cost to parents. Specifically, for adolescents, we 
predicted that greater parental empathy would be associated with a) better emotion 
regulation skills (based on previous work positing the formative role of attuned parenting in 
shaping these abilities (Field, 1994; Fox & Calkins, 2003)) and b) lower levels of interleukin 
1-rA (IL-1ra), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP): classic measures of pro-
inflammatory responses and systemic inflammation that are associated with risk for chronic 
diseases of aging, such as hypertension (Sesso et al., 2007) as well as with certain 
characteristics of family environments (Schreier, Roy, Frimer, & Chen, 2014). In parents, 
we hypothesized that greater parental empathy would be associated with a) higher self 
esteem and purpose in life (psychological states most consistently linked to prosocial 
efficacy (Greenfield & Marks, 2004; Jones & Prinz, 2005) but b) higher levels of chronic, 
low-grade inflammation, given the costs hypothesized to be associated with providing 
empathy to others. We focus on families with adolescents given the increasingly complex 
emotional landscape during this period (Arnett, 1999), which may make emotion regulation 
skills particularly important.
Method
Participants
Using advertisements in local media, 13-16 year old adolescents and their parents were 
recruited within a large metropolitan area as part of a larger study on psychosocial

 contributors to cardiovascular disease risk. One adolescent and one parent from each family 
participated. All participants were required to be free of any chronic or acute medical illness 
and to be English-speaking. Complete data on all study variables were available on 494 
individuals in 247 dyads (76% mothers; 52% girls). Adolescents were on average 14.56 
years old (SD=1.06) and parents were 45.77 years old (SD=5.42). Fifty-four percent of 
families identified as being of European descent, 35% were Asian descent, 21% were 
Hispanic descent, 14% were African descent, and 16% identified as “other.” Parents had on 
average some college education and average family income was in the $50,000-75,000 
Canadian dollars range. Seventy-two percent of parents were married, 17% were divorced, 
and 11% were single.
Procedure
As part of a baseline laboratory visit, parents and adolescents provided written consent, as 
overseen by the Institutional Review Board. Parents completed questionnaires described 
below. Blood was drawn from both parents and adolescents to measure inflammatory 
markers. Covariates related to inflammation, including waist circumference and 
demographic variables, were also recorded. Following this visit, adolescents completed two 
weeks of daily diary reporting on their emotion regulation experiences, which they mailed 
back to the lab in a pre-paid envelope.
Measures
Parental Report Measures
Empathy: Parents completed the Empathic Concern and Perspective-Taking subscales of the 
Interpersonal Reactivity Index (Davis, 1983), capturing both affective and cognitive aspects 
of empathy. Each scale consisted of seven items asking participants to rate on a 5-point scale 
how well various statements describe them. The Empathic Concern subscale assesses 
emotional experiences stemming from sympathy or compassion for others, containing 
statements like, “I often have tender, concerned feelings for people less fortunate than me” 
(α=.76). The Perspective Taking subscale probes for the respondent's tendency to adopt the 
psychological viewpoint of others, including items such as “I sometimes try to understand 
my friends better by imagining how things look from their perspective” (α=.76). Responses 
on the two scales were significantly correlated (r=.52, p<.01); consequently, a single 
composite score (labeled “Empathy” for simplicity) was computed by summing 
standardized scores on each scale. Higher scores indicate greater empathy. The reliability 
and validity of the IRI have previously been established (Cliffordson, 2001; Pulos, Elison, & 
Lennon, 2004).
Purpose in Life: Parents completed the Purpose in Life subscale of the Psychological Well 
Being questionnaire (Ryff, 1989), comprised of nine items assessing the extent to which 
parents believe they have meaning and purpose in life. Respondents were asked to rate 
statements on a 6-point scale such as, “Some people wander aimlessly through life, but I am 
not one of them” (α=.88). Greater purpose in life is reflected by higher scores on this 
measure.

 Self-Esteem: Parents’ self-esteem was measured using the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale 
(Rosenberg, 1965), a widely-used questionnaire consisting of ten items rated on a 7-point 
scale. A sample item includes, “I feel that I am a person of worth, at least on an equal basis 
with others.” Cronbach's alpha on this measure was .85 and higher scores correspond to 
higher self-esteem.
Perceived Child Emotion Regulation: Parents completed a shortened version of the 
Emotion Regulation Checklist (Shields & Cicchetti, 1997) by rating the extent to which they 
believed six statements were characteristic of their child, such as “Can recover quickly from 
things that upset or distress him/her” and “Is able to delay gratification.” Each statement was 
rated on a 4-point scale (α=.75), with higher scores reflecting more adaptive emotion 
regulation skills.
Child Report Measures
Daily Diary Assessment of Emotion Regulation: To capture a real-world assessment of 
emotion regulation, following the laboratory visit, adolescents were asked to complete daily 
diary cards every night immediately before going to bed for two weeks. As part of this diary, 
they reported on whether or not they experienced four aspects of emotion regulation during 
that day by checking a box after each statement: “Got frustrated,” “Got angry at other(s),” 
“Noticed I had mood swings across the day,” and “Recovered quickly from things that made 
me upset” (reverse coded). The sum of endorsed items for each day was then averaged 
across the 14-day period, with higher scores relating to greater difficulty regulating emotion.
Inflammatory Markers: Peripheral blood was drawn from both parents and adolescents 
using antecubital venipucture into serum separator (SST) tubes. Serum was harvested by 
centrifugation at 1200g for 10 minutes before being frozen at −30°C until assays were 
performed. Circulating levels of three markers of chronic, low-grade inflammation were 
assessed: C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), and 
interleukin 6 (IL-6). These markers were chosen because elevations are associated with all-
cause mortality and cardiovascular disease (Harris et al., 1999; Volpato et al., 2001) and 
have been found to fluctuate with psychological variables (e.g. Steptoe, Hamer, & Chida, 
2007).
CRP was measured in the Clinical Chemical Laboratory at St. Paul's Hospital using a high-
sensitivity, chemiluminscent technique on an IMMULITE 2000 (Diagnostic Products 
Corporation, Los Angeles, CA). This system has a lower detection threshold of .20mg/L and 
coefficients of variation of <3%. Circulating levels of IL-1ra and IL-6 were measured in the 
lab using ELISA kits (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). This system has a lower detection 
threshold for ILra of 18.3 pg/mL and for IL-6 of .07pg/mL. Intra- and inter-assay 
coefficients of variation were <10%. All inflammatory markers were log transformed to 
normalize distribution and reduce the influence of outliers prior to analyses.
Covariates: Demographic variables of participant age, ethnicity, gender, and gender-match 
between parent and adolescent were assessed and retained as covariates. Waist 
circumference, tobacco use, and alcohol use were additionally included as covariates for

 inflammation analyses. Waist circumference was selected as a measure of adiposity because 
it has been shown to be more closely related to chronic inflammation than overall adiposity 
indexed by body mass index (Festa et al., 2001; Hermsdorff, Zulet, Puchau, & Martinez, 
2010). In addition, child pubertal status, measured using the Pubertal Development Scale 
(Peterson, Crockett, Richards, & Boxer, 1988) was also included in child inflammatory 
analyses.
Potentially Confounding Variables
Parent-Child Relationship Quality: To better gauge the role of parental empathy in the 
context of more general parenting behaviors, aspects of parent-child relationship quality 
were also assessed. Using four-point scales, adolescents reported on parental harshness/
inconsistency and parental warmth using items developed by Brody et al. (2001). For the 
harshness/inconsistency subscale, 11 items probed for the frequency with which parents 
used harsh disciplinary techniques, such as spanking or shouting, and for the consistency of 
parents’ parenting practices. Higher scores reflected more negative parenting behaviors 
(more harsh, less consistent parenting). For the warmth subscale, 9 items assessed how 
frequently adolescents believed their parents acted supportively and lovingly toward them, 
such as listening to them or helping them on something important. Higher scores on this 
scale reflect greater parental warmth. Due to the significant correlation between the scales 
(r=−.28, p<.001), z-scored totals on each scale were summed (with harshness reverse 
scored) to create a relationship quality composite variable, with high scores indicating 
greater warmth and less harshness.
Perceived Stress: Adolescents and parents additionally each completed a 4-item scale 
designed to measure global perceived stress over the course of the last month (Cohen, 
Kamarck, & Mermelstein, 1983). For example, participants were asked to rate the extent to 
which they feel unable to control important things in their lives. This shortened measure has 
previously been used to predict health behaviors, such as smoking, fat consumption, and 
exercise (Ng & Jeffery, 2003).
Depressive Symptoms: Participants also completed the Center for Epidemiological Studies 
Depression Scale Short Form (Bjorgvinsson, Kertz, Bigda-Peyton, McCoy, & Aderka, 
2013), which is a widely used depression screen with established validity and reliability in 
both clinical and community samples (Anderson, Malmgren, Carter, & Patrick, 1994; 
Bradley, McGrath, Brannen, & Bagnell, 2010). This measure assesses the frequency of ten 
depressive symptoms over the course of the previous week, with higher scores reflecting 
higher levels of depressive symptoms.
Amount of Time Spent Together: As part of the take-home diary component, parents and 
adolescents were asked to record the amount of time they spent together that day in hours 
and minutes for 14 days. Each separately completed this measure at the end of the day, prior 
to going to sleep. Parent and adolescent reports were averaged per day and then averaged 
across the days of the diary.

 Statistical Analyses
Multiple regression analyses were conducted in which psychosocial and inflammatory 
outcomes were regressed on parental empathy, while covarying age, gender, ethnicity, 
gender congruence of the dyad, pubertal status, alcohol use, tobacco use, and waist 
circumference. Secondary analyses included parent-child relationship quality in the models 
of psychological and physiological outcomes to test whether parental empathy uniquely 
predicted outcomes above and beyond the contribution of more general relationship quality 
variables. In addition, further analyses probed the potentially confounding variables of 
perceived stress, depressive symptoms, and time parents and children spend together.
Results
Descriptive Statistics—Means and standard deviations for all study variables are 
presented in Table 1.
Adolescent Psychosocial Outcomes—Regression analyses revealed a significant 
independent contribution of parent empathy in the prediction of parent-reported adolescent 
emotion regulation (β=.14, p<.05), and adolescent's report of emotion regulation difficulty 
in their daily diary (β= −.13, p<.05). Patterns indicated that adolescents who had more 
empathic parents were rated as using more adaptive emotion regulation strategies by their 
parents and reported having less difficulty regulating emotions across a two-week daily 
diary period (see Table 2).
Adolescent Inflammation Outcomes—Beyond contributions of demographic 
covariates, pubertal status, alcohol use, tobacco use, and waist circumference, analyses 
similarly showed a significant independent contribution of parental empathy in predicting 
adolescents’ CRP (β= −.13, p<.05). That is, having a more empathic parent was associated 
with lower levels of CRP in adolescents.
Parent Psychosocial Outcomes—Among parents, empathy made significant 
independent contributions in the prediction of purpose in life (β=.24, p<.001), and self 
esteem (β=.18, p<.01). Here, parents who reported greater empathy also reported feeling a 
greater sense of purpose in their lives and higher self-esteem (see Table 3).
Parent Inflammation Outcomes—Parental empathy significantly contributed to the 
prediction of IL-1ra (β=.14, p<.05) and made a trend-level independent contribution to the 
prediction of IL-6 (β=.12, p<.10) in parents. In contrast to the psychosocial outcomes, these 
patterns indicate that parents who had higher levels of empathy had higher levels of 
inflammatory markers.
Secondary Analyses—One possibility is that associations with parental empathy simply 
reflect the effects of broader psychosocial factors, rather than a specific contribution of 
empathy. To test this, secondary analyses were conducted including various psychosocial 
variables as covariates in the above analyses in order to test the robustness of the parental 
empathy effects. In these analyses, we tested the role of parent-child relationship quality, 
stress, depression, and time spent together as alternative explanations for the empathy

 effects by including each variable in models of psychological and physiological outcomes, 
along with previous covariates and parental empathy. With respect to parent-child 
relationship quality, associations with parental empathy and perceived child emotion 
regulation, child CRP, and parent IL-1ra remained significant; the only exception was that 
the contribution of parental empathy to adolescents’ diary report of difficulty regulation 
emotions shifted slightly to a trend once parent-child relationship quality was controlled (β=
−.11, p=.09). With respect to participant perceived stress, all results linking parental 
empathy to psychological and immune outcomes in parents and children remained the same. 
With respect to participant depressive symptoms, all associations between parent empathy 
and psychological and immune outcomes in parents and children remained the same with the 
exception that the link between parental empathy and adolescents’ diary reported emotion 
regulation and adolescent CRP shifted slightly to marginal significance (β=−.11, p=.07 and 
β=−.13, p=.06, respectively,). With respect to the amount of time parents and adolescents 
spend together daily, all results remained significant, with the exception of the link between 
parental empathy and child CRP shifting slightly to trend level significant (β=−.13, p=.06).
Discussion
Parental empathy had beneficial associations with adolescents’ psychological and 
inflammatory profiles, but a mixed pattern of associations for parents. Among adolescents, 
higher parental empathy related to better emotion regulation as well as to lower levels of 
CRP. This supports and extends research suggesting that parental empathy plays an 
important role in the development of children's self regulation skills by finding evidence of 
associations with emotion regulation into adolescence (Field, 1994). It may be that highly 
empathic parents are more accurate in their assessment of their children's abilities and 
skilled at anticipating their needs. In turn, this may allow parents to more sensitively 
facilitate the development of masterful self-regulation while also signaling the availability of 
support (Fox & Calkins, 2003).
With regards to children's inflammatory profiles, there are several potential mechanisms by 
which parental empathy may relate to lower levels of adolescent inflammation. One 
possibility is that parental empathy may impact adolescent inflammatory processes by 
reducing the stressfulness of negative daily life experiences for children (Compas, Connor-
Smith, Saltzman, Thomsen, & Wadsworth, 2001). Previous work has demonstrated that 
adolescents evince higher levels of CRP when exposed to more substantial or frequent 
interpersonal stress, including with family members (Fuligni, Telzer, Bower, Cole, et al., 
2009a; Fuligni, Telzer, Bower, Irwin, et al., 2009b). By creating a more harmonious family 
environment, it is possible that households with empathic parents show lower levels of 
interpersonal conflict. Likewise, an empathic parent may encourage better emotion 
regulation (as discussed above) or may serve as a protective factor during times of stress by 
acting as a support buffer, resulting in children feeling less burdened by stressful 
experiences. An additional possibility is that empathic parenting may calibrate children's 
stress-responsive biological systems early in life through sensitive and expedient responding 
to child distress (Boyce & Ellis, 2005; Repetti, Taylor, & Seeman, 2002). Consequently, 
children may continue to show better physiological profiles, including lower systemic 
inflammation, in adolescence.

 Among parents, higher levels of empathy related to greater psychological well-being, but 
also to heightened inflammatory profiles. Psychologically, being empathic may give parents 
a greater sense of purpose, increasing eudemonic well-being (Steger, Kashdan, & Oishi, 
2008). These findings are consistent with work demonstrating that greater empathy and 
perspective-taking predicted higher job satisfaction among professions involving caretaking 
(e.g., physicians) (Gleichgerrcht & Decety, 2013) and higher well-being in caregivers of 
older adults (H. S. Lee, Brennan, & Daly, 2011). It is also in line with research suggesting 
that providing social support to others is related to better psychological outcomes 
(Silverstein, Chen, & Heller, 1996), including reduced depressive symptoms.
In contrast, empathy was also related to elevated indicators of chronic, low-grade 
inflammation in parents, suggesting that providing empathic care might come at a 
physiological cost. Parents who readily engage with the struggles and perspectives of others 
may leave themselves vulnerable to additional burdens, expending physiological resources 
in order to better help others. This is consistent with work suggesting that taking care of 
others and providing high levels of support can take a physiological toll through elevations 
in chronic stress (Kiecolt-Glaser, Dura, Speicher, Trask, & Glaser, 1991; Lovell & 
Wetherell, 2011; Rohleder, Marin, Ma, & Miller, 2009). It also compliments research 
documenting high rates of professional burnout seen in empathically-demanding professions 
(Larson & Yao, 2005; Zapf, Seifert, Schmutte, Mertini, & Holz, 2001). One additional 
possible explanation for these findings is that empathic parents may prioritize the needs of 
their children and insufficiently attend to important health behaviors, such as getting 
adequate sleep, exercise, and nutrition. Although the precise mechanism for these effects is 
yet unclear, this divergence between psychological and physiological outcomes suggests that 
certain psychosocial characteristics may have complex associations with mental and 
physical health processes and may be adaptive in ways that are only “skin deep” (Brody et 
al., 2013; Luthar, Doernberger, & Zigler, 1993).
There are several limitations to acknowledge in the present work. First, empathy was 
measured by self-report and the study design was cross-sectional. Future work should 
consider additional indicators of empathy in parents, such as child report or behavioral 
measures, and examine associations with psychological and physiological variables 
prospectively. In a related manner, multiple diary assessments per day as well as 
questionnaires relating to purpose in life specific to one's role as a parent or attachment 
status would improve the reliability and specificity of measures. Second, it is unclear why 
different inflammatory markers emerged as relating to empathy in parents versus children. 
Follow-up tests suggested that the differences in beta-weights between CRP and IL-6 were 
not statistically significant within parents or children; thus, this could be an issue of power 
and we are hesitant to overly interpret differences in associations. Moreover, each 
inflammatory marker serves a different purpose: for example, IL-6 is a pro-inflammatory 
cytokine that regulates immune responses and mediates the acute phase response, with one 
of its roles being to secrete CRP. CRP is released from the liver and has a longer plasma 
half-life than IL-6, and hence may be a more stable indicator of chronic inflammation (Wirtz 
et al., 2000). Previous research has sometimes shown differential associations with CRP 
versus cytokines (Sesso, Wang, Buring, Ridker, & Gaziano, 2007), and this may be due to 
factors such as differences in the half-lives or diurnal variations of these markers, making

 them correlated but not entirely overlapping with one another. It is also possible that noise 
that can occur in processing biological samples or because of the single time point blood 
draw could produce variability in associations across inflammatory markers. Third, 
consistent with trends in developmental research (Phares, Lopez, Fields, Kamboukos, & 
Duhig, 2005), the majority of the parents participating in our study were female. Although 
we statistically controlled for parent gender in all analyses, it is possible that expressions of 
empathy by mothers differ from expressions of empathy by fathers. It would also be 
important in future studies to consider simultaneously the role of empathy coming from 
different family members, such as mother vs. father, or parents vs. siblings. Lastly, in this 
preliminary investigation, we did not have information on certain possible mechanism 
variables—such as chronic strain or coping processes—that might account for our results, 
nor on other aspects of the family environment, such as parental marital quality, that may 
also affect parent and child psychological and physiological profiles. Additional research 
will be necessary to better understand the specific chain of psychological processes that link 
parental empathy to psychosocial and physiological outcomes in both parents and children.
The current work also raises several possible directions for future research. The present 
study examined trait-level empathy, which is believed to reflect largely stable, consistent 
tendencies of individuals to experience empathic concern and to take the perspective of 
others (Davis, 1983). Future work, however, might want to consider the idea of states of 
empathy—that is, whether a person is responding empathically in a given moment—and 
examine how this relates to health-relevant indices assessed with greater temporal 
resolution. Additionally, it is important to note that empathy was not operationalized as 
specific to the parent-child relationship. However, previous work supports the possibility 
that this type of relationship may be an especially germane context for displays of empathy 
because of overlap with dimensions known to increase empathic responding, specifically, 
familiarity, similarity, past experience, learning, and salience of distress (Preston & de Waal, 
2002). Future studies should explore the role of empathy in other types of relationships (e.g., 
friendships) and across different ages. In addition, the present work examined parents and 
children from a healthy community sample. As a result, families were generally well 
adjusted and values for immune markers were generally within normal ranges. An important 
topic for future research would be to examine less physically and psychologically healthy 
populations to explore whether parental empathy has similar associations in the context of 
emotionally-troubled youth or pediatric illness, for example. Given that the inflammatory 
markers assessed in the present work forecast the development of many chronic diseases of 
aging, such as cardiovascular disease (Harris et al., 1999; Volpato et al., 2001), the 
associations that we find with inflammatory markers here in healthy samples – if sustained 
over time – may confer risk (for parents) or protection (for children) for such diseases later 
in life. Future longitudinal work is needed to probe this possibility.
Despite these limitations, the current study reinforces the importance of examining both 
psychological and physical health-relevant markers when investigating the effects of 
empathy, as well as considering differential effects for empathy providers versus empathy 
recipients. Specifically, the present work suggests that although parental empathy appears to 
benefit adolescents, and relate to greater psychological well-being in parents, it can come at 
a physiological cost to parents.
