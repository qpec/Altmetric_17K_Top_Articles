IMPORTANCE As the US population ages, public health agencies have released guidelines
encouraging aerobic activity and muscle-strengthening exercises among older individuals.
Facial trauma from such activities among elderly individuals has long been underappreciated.
OBJECTIVES To evaluate the incidence of recreational activity–associated facial fractures
among older adults and to further delineate injury characteristics including demographics,
fracture location, and specific activities.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The National Electronic Injury Surveillance System was
used to collect data on emergency department visits from January 1, 2011, to December 31,
2015, for individuals 55 years of age or older who sustained facial fractures from recreational
activities. Individual entries were evaluated for activity code, fracture site, and demographics.
Weighting data were used to extrapolate national incidence.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Incidence and location of facial fractures and associated
recreational activity.
RESULTS During the study period, there were 20 519 emergency department visits for
recreational activity–associated facial fractures among adults 55 years of age or older (8107
women and 12 412 men; mean [SD] age, 66.5 [9.1] years). The annual incidence of facial
fractures increased by 45.3% from 2011 (n = 3174) through 2015 (n = 4612). Bicycling
(26.6%), team sports (15.4%), outdoor activities (10.1%), and gardening (9.5%) were the
most common causes of facial fractures. Walking and jogging caused 5.5% of fractures. In
cases specifying site of fracture, nasal (65.4%) and orbital (14.1%) fractures were the most
common. A greater proportion of men than women sustained bicycle-associated fractures
(35.7% vs 14.9%; P = 3.1056 × 10−170), while more women than men sustained fractures
associated with gardening (15.5% vs 6.1%; P = 2.1029 × 10−97), outdoor activities (14.6% vs
7.7%; P = 4.3156 × 10−50), and gym exercise (7.7% vs 1.3%; P = 3.0281 × 10−114). Men
harbored a greater likelihood than women of orbital (14.9% vs 12.8%; P = 6.1468 × 10−5) and
mandible fractures (9.3% vs 2.0%; P = 9.3760 × 10−64). Walking and jogging and gardening
comprised a greater proportion of injuries in older cohorts.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Facial fractures sustained from recreational activity increased
by 45.3% during a 5-year period among older adults. Although bicycling was the most
common activity facilitating these injuries, many other pursuits represent areas of concern.
Nasal fractures predominated, although orbital fractures increased with age. These findings
offer areas for targeted prevention and provide valuable information for patient counseling.
Furthermore, initiatives encouraging greater activity among this population may need to be
accompanied by guidelines for injury prevention.

ignificant improvements in medicine and technology,
adoption of preventive strategies, and decreasing smok-
ing rates all contribute to an increasing life expectancy
among US adults in the past century.1-4 As the baby boomer
generation comes of age, the population of Americans older
than 55 years of age continues to increase dramatically, mak-
ing a greater understanding of age-specific health concerns im-
portant for individual practitioners as well as policymakers.
Hence, programs such as the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention’
s Healthy Aging Initiative have been developed in
recent years.5-7 Specifically, guidelines have been released by
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention pertaining to
physical activity among older adults, with specific recommen-
dations detailing the appropriate amount of moderate-
intensity aerobic activity and muscle-strengthening activi-
ties required for maintaining health.8
An active and aging population carries increasingly
important implications for patient counseling, injury pat-
terns, and prevention. Although head injuries along with
trauma affecting the hips and extremities have been well
studied in this age group, facial trauma has long been
underappreciated. Hanba and colleagues9 recently exam-
ined facial trauma patterns among American adults, noting
that risk of facial fracture increased with advancing age,
female sex, and race/ethnicity. Facial trauma among
younger adults more frequently resulted from participation
in recreational activities compared with injuries among
older adults.
In light of the aging US population and recent public
health initiatives, we had several objectives in the current
analysis. We were interested in focusing on older adults (≥55
years of age) and determining a national incidence of facial
fractures resulting from participation in recreational activi-
ties. In addition to calculating an incidence and elucidating
temporal trends, our objectives also included exploring
what activities most commonly facilitated these injuries
among this cohort, delineating the anatomical locations of
these fractures and comparing demographic trends. Particu-
larly in our current health care environment, this informa-
tion may be timely and invaluable for practitioners involved
in the care of older patients, physicians managing facial
trauma, and policymakers.
Methods
TheNationalElectronicInjurySurveillanceSystem(NEISS)was
used to collect relevant data in this analysis. Initially offered
by the US Consumer Product Safety Commission as a tool to
evaluate emergency department (ED) visits associated with
consumer products, the NEISS was expanded in the past de-
cade to include injuries associated with sports and recre-
ational activity, and it has demonstrated its value in numer-
ous analyses.10-18 The NEISS database is publicly available and
qualifies as nonhuman participant research. Therefore, insti-
tutional review board approval was not required. Because all
data entries are deidentified in the NEISS database, informed
consent was not obtained.
Emergency department visits from the most recent 5-year
period available, January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2015, were
evaluated for entries involving adults 55 years of age or older
who sustained facial fractures. Each entry is assigned a unique
productoractivitycode,andonlyentriesspecifyinginjuryfrom
a recreational activity (eg, not a consumer product) were in-
cluded. There were ultimately 507 entries extrapolating to
20 519 ED visits included in this analysis.
We used methods detailed previously in the literature to
ensure accurate reporting of NEISS trends.19 This resource pro-
vides weighted data, which allowed us to extrapolate na-
tional incidence using SAS statistical software (SAS Institute
Inc). Patient demographics, including age and sex, were evalu-
ated, along with specific activities facilitating facial fracture.
In addition, the text narrative accompanying each entry was
evaluated to determine the specific location of the facial frac-
ture (orbit, nose, maxilla or zygoma, mandible, frontal, or
other).
Statistical Analysis
To report clinically useful comparisons, multiple compari-
sons were performed individually for each respective group
using χ2 analysis. The threshold for significance was set at
P < .05.
Results
From 2011 through 2015, a total of 20 519 adults 55 years of age
or older presented to EDs with facial fractures. Of these pa-
tients, 12 412 (60.5%) were identified as men, and the remain-
ing 8107 (39.5%) as women. A total of 3927 individuals (19.1%)
were 75 years of age or older. The weighted national inci-
dence of cases increased through all years except from 2014
through 2015 (Figure 1). A plurality of facial fractures were sus-
tainedfrombicycling(26.6%),followedbyparticipationinteam

Question What are the incidence and characteristics of
recreational activity-associated facial fractures among elderly
Americans?
Findings In this analysis, which uses the National Electronic Injury
Surveillance System for facial fractures from recreational activities,
there were 20 519 emergency department visits for recreational
activity–associated facial fractures among adults 55 years of age or
older. The annual incidence of facial fractures from recreational
activities increased by 45.3% from 2011 through 2015; bicycling
and team sports were the most common activities involved, and
men were more likely than women to sustain orbital and mandible
fractures.
Meaning These findings offer areas for targeted prevention and
provide valuable information for patient counseling.

 in facial fractures were baseball and softball (11.9% of all frac-
tures), whereas the most common individual sport repre-
sented was golfing (2.7%). The anatomical location of the fa-
cial fracture was reported in 31 809 cases (67.3%); of those
cases,amajorityoffracturessustainedweretothenose(20 803
[65.4%])(Figure3),followedbyorbitalfractures(4485[14.1%]).
Sex
Differences between the sexes in mechanisms of injury were
noted (Table 1), with a significantly larger proportion of men
than women sustaining facial fractures from bicycling (35.7%
vs 14.9%; P = 3.1056 × 10−170), whereas a greater proportion of
women than men sustained facial fractures while gardening
(15.5% vs 6.1%; P = 2.1029 × 10−97), participating in nature or
outdoor activities (14.6% vs 7.7%; 4.3156 × 10−50), and exer-
cising at a gym (7.7% vs 1.3%; P = 3.0281 × 10−114). Further-
more, a greater proportion of facial fractures among men than
women were sustained to the orbit (14.9% vs 12.8%;
P = 6.1468 × 10 −5) and mandible (9.3% vs 2.0%;
P = 9.3760 × 10−64),whereasagreaterproportionoffacialfrac-
tures among women than men were to the nose (74.9% vs
59.3%; P = 3.5619 × 10−21) (Table 2).
Age
The breakdown of injury mechanism and location varied with
increasing age. A decreasing proportion of facial fractures oc-
curred owing to bicycling when broken down by decade of in-
jury (55-64 years, 39.3%; 65-74 years, 23.6%; and ≥75 years,
5.8%) (Table 1). In contrast, walking and jogging and garden-
ing comprised a greater proportion of injuries among the el-
derly (walking and jogging: 55-64 years, 0.8%; 65-74 years,
7.4%;and≥75years,14.4%;gardening:55-64years,3.3%;65-74
years, 10.8%; and ≥75 years, 23.8%) (Table 1). Individuals 55
to 64 years of age were less likely to sustain orbital and nasal
fractures(orbital,11.7%;nasal,54.4%)thanthose65to74years
of age (orbital, 16.1%; P = 8.9578 × 10−13; nasal, 71.7%;
P = 7.3508 × 10−42) or those 75 years of age or older (orbital,
16.0%;P = 3.3493 × 10−12;nasal,78.3%;P = 2.1302 × 10−66)and
were more likely to have fractures located in the maxilla or zy-
goma(55-64years,12.4%;65-74years,2.2%;P = 7.9207 × 10−74;
and ≥75 years, 1.1%; P = 2.1598 × 10−55) and mandible (55-64
years, 9.8%; 65-74 years, 4.0%; P = 5.7678 × 10−26; and ≥75
years, 3.5%; P = 5.1414 × 10−19) (Table 2). The mean age of in-
dividuals injured walking and jogging was 74.8 years (eFig-
ure in the Supplement), while bicyclists had the lowest mean
age (62.8 years) of individuals in this analysis.
Discussion
Many analyses have demonstrated a positive association
between facial fractures among older adults, longer hospital
stays, and mortality rates, all leading to a greater health care
burden.20 There are several potential reasons for this asso-
ciation, including the profound effect that facial trauma
may have on independence and functionality, including
effects on breathing, speech, swallowing, and sight. None-
theless, extensive investigations into fractures among
adults focus largely on injuries elsewhere throughout the
body, and there remains a paucity of literature detailing the
causes of facial fractures among older adults. With an
expanding and increasingly active older population, our
study fills a gap in the current literature by delineating the
epidemiologic factors and patterns of facial fractures in
such settings.
The incidence of facial fractures among older adults stem-
ming from recreational activities increased year by year dur-
ing the period from 2011 to 2014 and increased by 45.3% from
2011 (n = 3174) to 2015 (n = 4612) (Figure 1). This is a concern-
ing increase despite previous study into the proper amounts
and methods of exercise for aging adults,3,8 suggesting that
strategies for injury prevention and education should accom-
pany the contemporary movement that has encouraged ac-
tivity among this population. Our findings also demonstrate
that activities such as bicycling and team sports are most as-
sociated with facial fractures in this vulnerable population

 (Figure 2). Furthermore, because we discovered that the pro-
portion of facial fractures from various activities depends on
age and sex, our study highlights areas for possible interven-
tion and education for specific populations.
Exhaustive evidence has shown significantly decreased
bone density throughout the skeletons of older adult
women,21-29 contributing to an increased risk for fractures
compared with men, even in those without osteoporosis.22,29
Although such changes in bone density have been shown to
extend to facial bones,30 our data demonstrate an overall
male predominance among this injury population (60.5%).
This finding differs from fractures seen throughout the rest
of the body, where certain fractures have a strong female
predominance,31 as well as from previous studies showing
significantly higher rates of facial fractures in women
among the older population.20 This finding suggests that
facial fractures specifically due to recreational activities do
not follow the typical distributions seen among fractures in
older adults as a whole, which is an important distinction
for health care professionals to keep in mind when consid-
ering facial trauma diagnosis and management, as well as
preventive counseling. Furthermore, a survey-based study
exploring sex differences in the rates of participation in rec-
reational activities may help further elucidate the consider-
ations responsible for our findings. The greater rate of frac-
tures in men coincides with differences in the causes of
fracture between sexes, as a majority of men sustained frac-
tures while participating in “higher-risk” activities associ-
ated with greater energy, such as bicycling and sports, com-
pared with women, whose fractures were most frequently
associated with activities such as gardening and dog walk-
ing (Table 1). Although injuries associated with more ener-
getic and vigorous activities were more common overall,
physicians should be aware that even activities character-
ized as having a low risk of injury such as gardening and
walking still carry potential for trauma and facial fractures
in this older patient population.
Differences in epidemiologic factors of facial fracture be-
tween sexes are further highlighted by differences in fracture
location. Although the greatest proportions of fractures were
of the nasal and orbital bones in both sexes, which are seen to
increase with age, there were significantly higher rates of man-
dible fractures, which tend to regress with age, among men.
Mandible fractures have previously been associated with fa-
cial fractures in younger patients.20,32 Hence, while results for
women and men 65 years of age or older coincide with previ-
ous findings20 and depend largely on structural changes as-
sociated with sex and age, fractures sustained during recre-
ation by men younger than 65 years of age are likely influenced
more by the mechanism of injury and often display different
fracture patterns.

 Limitations
To our knowledge, this is the first investigation into the epi-
demiologic factors of facial fractures sustained during recre-
ation in the older adult population. As the US population
continues to age, issues that affect this segment of the
population will have an increasingly greater effect on health
care delivery and costs, and understanding the unique
issues associated with older adults will take on greater
importance. However, our study has some weaknesses
inherent to the study design. Although the NEISS database
is an excellent tool for estimating ED visits, it does not
include patients who may have presented elsewhere; conse-
quently, our extrapolated national incidence rates may
potentially be underestimating the extent to which facial
fractures among older adults is a public health concern. The
database also does not provide detailed information on
management or outcomes. Despite this limitation, we were
able to collect a large sample size from across the country,
and the NEISS focus on recreational activities makes it ideal
for analyzing relevant trauma. Furthermore, our conclu-
sions also possess a greater degree of external validity com-
pared with individual institutional studies.
Conclusions
Concomitant with numerous initiatives encouraging exercise
among older Americans, facial fractures sustained from rec-
reational activity increased by 45.3% during a 5-year period
among adults 55 years of age or older. Although bicycling was
the most commonly identified activity associated with facial
fracture, many other pursuits represent areas of concern. Na-
sal fractures predominated, although orbital fractures in-
creased with age. These findings offer areas for targeted pre-
vention and provide valuable information for patient
counseling. Furthermore, initiatives encouraging greater ac-
tivity among this population may need to be accompanied by
guidelines for injury prevention.
