ABSTRACT
Objective: Historically, alcohol use and related harms
are more prevalent in men than in women. However,
emerging evidence suggests the epidemiology of
alcohol use is changing in younger cohorts. The
current study aimed to systematically summarise
published literature on birth cohort changes in male-to-
female ratios in indicators of alcohol use and related
harms.
Methods: We identified 68 studies that met inclusion
criteria. We calculated male-to-female ratios for 3
broad categories of alcohol use and harms (any
alcohol use, problematic alcohol use and alcohol-
related harms) stratified by 5-year birth cohorts
ranging from 1891 to 2001, generating 1568 sex
ratios. Random-effects meta-analyses produced pooled
sex ratios within these 3 categories separately for each
birth cohort.
Findings: There was a linear decrease over time in the
sex ratio for all 3 categories of alcohol use and related
harms. Among those born in the early 1900s, males
were 2.2 (95% CI 1.9 to 2.5) times more likely than
females to consume alcohol, 3.0 (95% CI 1.5 to 6.0)
times more likely to drink alcohol in ways suggestive of
problematic use and 3.6 (95% CI 0.4 to 30.3) times
more likely to experience alcohol-related harms.
Among cohorts born in the late 1900s, males were 1.1
(95% CI 1.1 to 1.2) times more likely than females to
consume alcohol, 1.2 (95% CI 1.1 to 1.4) times more
likely to drink alcohol in ways suggestive of
problematic use and 1.3 (95% CI 1.2 to 1.3) times
more likely to experience alcohol-related harms.
Conclusions: Findings confirm the closing male–
female gap in indicators of alcohol use and related
harms. The closing male–female gap is most evident
among young adults, highlighting the importance of
prospectively tracking young male and female cohorts
as they age into their 30s, 40s and beyond.
Alcohol use and alcohol-related harms are
among the most significant risk factors for
burden of disease. Overall, they resulted in
around 5 million deaths globally in 2010,
and were responsible for more than 161
million years of life lost, equating to 5% of
total global health burden.1 Historically, the
prevalence of alcohol use and related harms
has been between 2 and 12 times higher in
men than women.2–7 However, there is emer-
ging
evidence
to
suggest
that
the
gap
between men and women in alcohol use and
related harms is closing among recently born
cohorts.8–11 Understanding sex-specific birth
cohort trends in the epidemiology of alcohol
use is vital as they point to key environmental
and social mechanisms associated with popu-
lation shifts in alcohol use patterns. For
example, studies have attributed these gener-
ational
shifts
in
sex-specific
drinking
to
changes in traditional gender roles over
Strengths and limitations of this study
▪ Prior to this study, the evidence around gender
convergence in alcohol use and alcohol-related
harms was fragmented. This study systematically
summarised all available literature and provided
a quantification of the rate of gender conver-
gence through the derivation of a single metric
—the male-to-female ratio in alcohol use and
alcohol-related harms.
▪ This study was strengthened by its examination
of 11 separate indicators of alcohol use and
alcohol-related
harms,
summarised
in
three
broad categories and showed that gender con-
vergence
was
evident
across
all
indicator
categories.
▪ While the derivation of a single metric facilitated
numerical synthesis of data, the analyses are not
independent of measurement variance.
▪ The current study did not test specific hypoth-
eses for why the male–female gap in alcohol use
and alcohol-related harms is closing.

 time,5 changes in sex-specific attitudes towards drink-
ing12 and/or changes in the contexts and environments
in which men and women now drink.4 Furthermore,
substantial changes over time in the sex distribution of
alcohol use may require a rethink of effective health pol-
icies, resource allocation models and intervention strat-
egies to combat the societal costs associated with use. In
fact, a recent evidence synthesis of the effectiveness of
population-level alcohol policy interventions argued that
with shifting sex-specific population trends in alcohol
use, there is a pressing need to understand the effective-
ness of policy interventions separately for males and
females.13
Several individual studies have empirically addressed
the question of sex differences in birth cohort effects on
alcohol use. The most methodologically rigorous of
these employs age-period-cohort (APC) modelling, a
statistical approach designed to isolate temporal changes
in prevalence that are independently associated with
being in a specific birth cohort from changes associated
with a specific age and/or a particular historical period.
A subset of these APC analyses has examined whether
the birth cohort effect is of the same magnitude for
men and women and reported mixed evidence.14–18 For
example, analysing data from the Finnish Drinking
Habits
Survey,
Harkonen
and
Makela14
found
male-to-female convergence in the frequency of heavy
episodic drinking (defined as 6+ drinks on one occasion
for males and 4+ drinks on one occasion for females) in
recent cohorts. However, Keyes and Miech17 demon-
strated that while heavy episodic drinking (defined as 5+
drinks
on
one
occasion
for
males
and
females)
decreased in recent birth cohorts, there was little evi-
dence of sex differences in this cohort effect. Over and
above these APC studies, a wider body of literature has
explored, in more indirect ways, the changing epidemi-
ology of alcohol use over time. A narrative synthesis
carried out nearly 10 years ago concluded that the
male–female gap in alcohol problems appears to be nar-
rowing in some countries.19
However, in this narrative synthesis, sex convergence
was not numerically quantified making it difficult to
judge the extent of the convergence. Moreover, the pub-
lished literature on sex convergence in alcohol use has
nearly doubled in size since 2008 indicating a timely
need to revisit this issue. We report the results of a sys-
tematic review and meta-analysis of the male-to-female
ratio in key indicators of alcohol use and related harm
to enumerate the magnitude of any observed male–
female convergence in alcohol use and related harms
over time.
METHODS
The current systematic review followed guidelines for
the
conducting
and reporting
of Meta-analyses Of
Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE20) and
the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews
and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA).21 22 The final reporting
was informed by the findings of a systematic review of
meta-analyses of observational studies in psychiatric epi-
demiology.23 We used EppiReviewer V.4 for the manage-
ment
of
screening,
coding
and
data

Study inclusion criteria
We used search terms that aimed to identify studies that
reported on the following indicators of alcohol use and
related harm: lifetime and/or current alcohol use dis-
order (abuse or dependence); alcohol-related problems
(eg,
drunkenness,
other
negative
consequences),
alcohol-related treatment seeking; stages in the alcohol
use and related problems cycle (eg, onset of use, transi-
tion from use to disorder). We also explicitly looked for
studies reporting data on commonly investigated drink-
ing patterns (eg, heavy episodic or binge drinking). We
included studies published between January 1980 and
June 2014 inclusive that:
1. Measured at least one of the above indicators of
alcohol use or related harm;
2. Reported on a regionally or nationally representative
population sample;
3. Explicitly measured a cohort effect or presented indi-
cator data across at least two birth cohorts; and
4. Presented indicator data separately for males and
females or carried out explicit comparisons between
males and females (this included sex by time or sex
by cohort interactions).
We included studies based on samples of high school
or college students where these samples were regionally
or nationally representative. We excluded studies that
only sampled targeted groups within the population (eg,
people seeking treatment). The decision was made to
focus only on representative population samples in
order to characterise overall changes in general popula-
tion means and prevalence estimates at regional and
national levels. Full electronic search strategies including
search terms are contained in tables 1–3.
Search strategy
We searched three databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE,
PsychINFO) using three separate search strategies. The
search strategies were developed by TS and CC in con-
sultation with the librarian at the National Drug and
Alcohol Research Centre (MK).
Search strategy 1 aimed to identify studies that explicitly
derived parameter estimates of changes over time in
indicators of alcohol use and related harms. This strat-
egy focused on keywords that are commonly used to
describe APC analyses and these were combined with
database-specific
MeSH
headings
and
keywords
for
alcohol use and related harms. Relevant MeSH terms
were identified separately in each database and were

 ‘exploded’ to capture the broadest possible set of
alcohol studies. When subject headings did not accur-
ately cover the target domain, we added .mp to the
search term (see table 1).
Search strategy 2 aimed to identify studies that focused
on sex differences in alcohol use and related harms but
did not explicitly conduct APC analyses. This strategy
included search terms related to sex or gender, sex or
gender convergence and sex or gender gap, and these
were combined with the broad database-specific terms
for alcohol and related harm outlined for search strategy
1 (see table 2).
Search strategy 3 aimed to identify studies that reported
data split by sex and birth cohorts or by sex and age
groups (as a proxy for birth cohorts) but did not expli-
citly conduct APC analysis or examine sex convergence.
In order to obtain adequate sensitivity and specificity,
this search was restricted to gold standard epidemio-
logical studies based on guidelines developed for the
WHO 2010 Global Burden of Disease study protocols24
and used narrower terms to capture studies that have
focused on alcohol use and related harms.
The initial search of the three databases was under-
taken in January 2013 and then updated at the end of
June 2014. All article abstracts were screened independ-
ently by one of the authors (TS, CC or ZT) to exclude
those that were ineligible for inclusion. We obtained full
texts of remaining articles, and the same authors inde-
pendently
assessed
them
in
detail
for
inclusion.
Non-English texts were not included in the review.
Approximately 20% of abstracts and full-text articles
were independently screened by a second reviewer.

Data extraction
Data were extracted in the following domains: study
design, population, country, survey name, survey year,
sample age, sample size, birth cohorts covered, indica-
tors reported including indicator definitions, definition
timeframe and whether the authors reported evidence
of gender convergence on any indicators of interest.
Studies varied in the parameters used to define alcohol
use and related harms. For example, studies reporting
data on prevalence of any alcohol use differed with
regard to timeframe (lifetime, past 12 months, current),
definition of alcohol use (one or more standard drinks,
12+ or more standard drinks), frequency of drinking
(weekly, monthly, yearly) and whether a continuous or
categorical measure was used. Similarly, studies that mea-
sured alcohol-related harms (eg, abuse and dependence,
alcohol-related problems) differed in terms of diagnostic

 system (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders (DSM)-III, DSM-IIIR, DSM-IV), timeframe
(lifetime, past 12 months) and type of negative conse-
quence considered (eg, drunkenness, drink driving,
risky sexual behaviour). While some of these differences
are methodological, others reflect important conceptual
distinctions.81 Attention to these methodological and
conceptual distinctions resulted in an initial coding of
11 key indicators of alcohol use and related harm that
were further grouped into three broad categories:
A. Indicators of any alcohol use, including:
1. Prevalence of any alcohol use (categorical),
2. Prevalence of alcohol abstinence (categorical),
3. Total amount of alcohol consumed (continuous),
4. Frequency of alcohol use (ordinal or continuous);
B. Indicators of alcohol use that is suggestive of prob-
lematic use, including:
5. Prevalence of heavy episodic or binge drinking
(categorical),
6. Prevalence of risky drinking (categorical),
7. Frequency of heavy episodic or binge drinking
(ordinal or continuous),
8. Age of onset of alcohol use (continuous);
C. Indicators of alcohol-related harms:
9. Prevalence of alcohol-related problems (categorical),
10. Prevalence of alcohol use disorder (categorical),
11. Frequency of alcohol-related problems (continuous).
See (online supplementary file) for more details of
individual indicator definitions for each included study.
Study quality
Study quality was rated based on the critical appraisal
tool for use in systematic reviews addressing questions of
prevalence developed by Munn et al,82 as well as the
study design and analysis used to examine gender con-
vergence in indicators of alcohol use and related harms.
Level 1 studies were repeated cross-sectional studies that
conducted APC analysis; level 2 studies were repeated
cross-sectional studies that separated age and cohort
effects (either by presenting data across cohorts in a
single age group or by presenting data across cohorts in
separate age groups); level 3 studies were repeated cross-
sectional studies that did not attempt to separate age
and cohort effects; level 4 studies were single cross-
sectional studies that reported lifetime estimates of at
least one target indicator by sex and age groups (proxy
for birth cohorts). Study quality was assessed for all

ratings achieved through consensus.
Statistical analysis
In addition to the extracted qualitative data described
above, quantitative data (eg, percentages, means, etc) on
the 11 key indicators for each available birth cohort for
males and females were also extracted and summarised
using meta-analysis. To facilitate quantitative synthesis
across varying indicator definitions, we calculated a
single metric, the male-to-female ratio, to express the
relationship between male and female levels of alcohol
use and related harms. This sex ratio represents the rela-
tive,
not
absolute,
difference
between
males
and
females. A value >1 indicates greater alcohol use or
more alcohol-related harms in males compared with
females. For two indicators, age of onset of alcohol use
and alcohol abstinence, the ratio was reversed. Sex ratios
on each of the 11 key indicators were calculated separ-
ately for each birth cohort in each study where data were
available. For sex ratios based on binary indicators, esti-
mates in which both the male and female prevalence
fell below 5% (n=39, 2.4% of all estimates) were consid-
ered
base
rate
outliers
and
not
further
analysed.
Sensitivity analyses indicated that this exclusion did not
impact the overall findings. All sex ratios were logarith-
mically transformed and all meta-analyses were carried
out on these logarithmically transformed values, with
back-transformation for reporting purposes. Log sex
ratios for binary indicators were considered equivalent
to log risk ratios and SEs were calculated accordingly.
SEs for each (log) sex ratio derived from means of con-
tinuous indicators were calculated using formulae con-
tained in Friedrich et al.83 Pooled (log) sex ratios with
95% CIs were calculated separately for each birth cohort
with STATA (V.12.1). Significant heterogeneity, as as-
sessed by the I2 index, was evident. Thus, random-effects
meta-analyses were carried out and statistical heterogen-
eity was handled using the Knapp-Hartung approach
Cornell et al.84 Random-effects metaregression analyses
were carried out to determine how much of this hetero-
geneity in sex ratios was explained by birth cohort, con-
trolling for important methodological characteristics.
These characteristics included age at the time of data col-
lection, world region, study design and indicator time-
frame. These analyses were carried out and are presented
separately for each of the three broad alcohol indicator
categories. Formal tests of publication bias were not
applicable in the context of the current analysis.
RESULTS
Summary of characteristics of included studies
We identified 68 citations that met inclusion criteria (see
figure 1, (online supplementary file) and table 4). Data
used in the studies were collected between the years 1948
and 2014 representing birth cohorts from 1891 to 2000.
One-quarter of the studies used data collected across a
timespan of 20 years or more (n=16), 5 of which used
data collected over 30 years or more. More than one-third
of studies (36.7%) were conducted in North America,
39.7% in Europe, 5.9% in Asia, 7.4% in Oceania, 2.9% in
another world region and 7.4% across more than one
world region. Study sample sizes ranged from 1056 to
809 281 (median 15 144); 27.9% of studies had a sample

lowed by indicators of problematic alcohol use (N=30)
and indicators of alcohol-related harms (n=18). Following
qualitative review, 42 of the 68 studies reported evidence
of sex convergence in recent cohorts on at least one
alcohol indicator (see online supplementary file). The
majority of these (n=31; 73.8%) reported that conver-
gence was driven by greater and/or more consistent
increases in subsequent birth cohorts on one or more
alcohol indicators among females compared with males.
Six studies reported that convergence was driven by
decreases in males across birth cohorts and five studies
reported mixed findings depending on the country or
indicator under investigation.
Individual study estimates
Of the 68 citations, we identified 50 that provided indica-
tor estimates separately for males and females across at
least two separate birth cohorts. While not every citation
provided estimates in every birth cohort, collectively these
citations spanned birth cohorts starting in 1891 and
ending in 2000. These citations allowed for the calculation
of 1568 separate sex ratios, 845 related to any alcohol use,
439 to problematic alcohol use and 323 to alcohol-related
harm. Owing to low numbers of estimates, the earliest four
birth cohorts were collapsed into one category (1891–
1910), as were the latest two birth cohorts (1991–2000).
Among the subset of n=518 estimates based on categorical
indicators of any alcohol use, the matched female (x-axis)
and male (y-axis) prevalence estimates are graphed, by
birth cohort, in figure 2. A diagonal line is superimposed
on each graph indicating where male and female estimates
would be equal and therefore where the sex ratio would
be 1. As expected, most estimates fall above this line of
equality, denoting a male excess in the prevalence of any
alcohol use. However, in recent birth cohorts, particularly
those born from 1976 onwards, the estimates are shifting
closer to the line of equality, indicating a narrowing of the
male–female gap.
Pooled results from meta-analyses
For all three broad indicator categories (any alcohol use,
problematic alcohol use and alcohol-related harms), the
pooled sex ratios declined over successive birth cohorts
(see tables 5–7). With regard to indicators of any alcohol

 use, the sex ratio was 2.2 (95% CI 1.9 to 2.5) in the 1891–
1910 birth cohort indicating that males born between 1891
and 1910 were around two times more likely to report any
alcohol use than their female counterparts born during
the same time. The sex ratios decreased to a low of 1.1
(95% CI 1.1 to 1.2) in those born between 1991 and 2000.
The same pattern of findings was evident for indicators of
problematic alcohol use (declining from 3.0 (95% CI 1.5
to 6.0) in the 1891–1910 birth cohort to 1.2 (95% CI 0.9 to
1�5) in the 1991–2000 birth cohort) and indicators of
alcohol-related harm (declining from 3.6 (95% CI 0.4 to
30.4) in the 1891–1910 birth cohort to 1.3 (95% CI 1.2 to
1.3) in the 1991–2000 birth cohort). For all three broad
indicator categories, metaregression analyses indicated that
the sex ratio declined linearly across birth cohorts. For
example, for indicators of any alcohol use when birth
cohort was entered into the metaregression as a continu-
ous variable, each successive 5-year birth cohort was

DISCUSSION
The current study summarised the available published
literature on sex convergence in indicators of alcohol
use and related harms across the world. By extracting
estimates from studies and deriving a single metric, the
male-to-female ratio, we were able to use meta-analysis to
numerically
summarise
the
overall
relationship
of
male-to-female alcohol use, problematic alcohol use and
alcohol-related harms. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first study to do so. The results of the
meta-analysis indicate that the male–female gap in
alcohol use is closing over time.
The results of the qualitative review demonstrated
support for sex convergence among recent cohorts.
Sixty-two per cent of identified studies found evidence
of sex convergence among recent cohorts on at least 1
of the 11 individual alcohol-related indicators, 4 of
which were APC analyses. Meta-analysis confirmed these
qualitative results indicating, for example, that the sex
ratio in any alcohol use has decreased from 2.2 among
those born in the earliest years of the 20th century to
1.1 among those born during the end of the 20th
century. Follow-up analyses on the rate of change in sex
ratios demonstrated that the decline in the sex ratio was
steepest
in
cohorts
born
from
1966
onwards.
For
example, overall, the sex ratios for any alcohol use
decreased by 4.2% with each successive 5-year birth
cohort between 1891 and 2000. However, this rate of
change was 1.2% for successive cohorts born from 1891
to 1966 and 10.1% for cohorts born from 1966 to 2000.
It is important to note that the sex ratio metric used
in the current study provides information on the relative
prevalence of alcohol use or related harms in males
versus females. This metric does not empirically deter-
mine whether observed changes in the sex ratio are
being driven by increases or decreases in male or female
prevalence or whether, in fact, there is a more complex
indicator-specific and/or birth cohort-dependent rela-
tionship between male and female alcohol use and/or
harms that is driving the change in sex ratios over time.
However, the qualitative review determined that of the
42 studies that reported some evidence for sex conver-
gence in alcohol use or related harms, the majority of
these reported that convergence was driven by greater
and/or
more
consistent
increases
in
indicators
of
alcohol use among females compared with males from
recent cohorts.5

interesting to note that 5% of the sex ratios were <1,
indicating that, in some cases, females have surpassed
males in their drinking levels. The majority of such esti-
mates (60%) came from cohorts born after 1981.

The pooling of estimates within birth cohorts across
studies meant we are not able to use traditional publica-
tion bias assessments.85 However, our conclusions were
informed most by large nationally representative surveys
several of which were strengthened by APC analyses, and
it is unlikely that we would have missed large unpub-
lished surveys or relevant APC studies that were only
available in the grey literature. Moreover, our findings
are consistent with the latest data on trends and social
disparities in alcohol consumption in Organization for
Economic
Co-operation
and
Development
(OECD)
member countries around the world.86 While the deriv-
ation of a single metric facilitated numerical synthesis of
data, the analyses are not independent of measurement
variance. If, for example, definitions that are associated
with smaller sex ratios were more likely to be used by
studies reporting recent cohorts, this could have inflated
the observed cohort effect on sex convergence. While
the number of different definitions used by studies pre-
cludes direct testing of this effect, the fact that sex con-
vergence across birth cohorts was found controlling for
important methodological characteristics and across the
three broad categories of indicators examined, implies
that the finding is at least somewhat robust to the vari-
ability in methods and measurement across studies.
Finally, 68% of studies included in the meta-analysis
reported data on multiple indicators and as such a sig-
nificant proportion of the sex ratios were derived from
the same respondents within a given study. While violat-
ing the assumption of independence, this multiplicity
was far more often observed across rather than within the
broad indicator categories. Given we pooled sex ratios
within broad indicator categories, this observation is
unlikely to impact on the summary estimates.
The current study did not test specific hypotheses for
why the male–female gap in substance use is closing.
However, speculative explanations can be proposed.
Changes over time in female gender role traditionality
may be one explanation for the closing male–female gap.
In a large multicountry epidemiological study, Seedat
et al5 measured female gender role traditionality using
female-to-male ratios in factors such as the percentage
participating in the labour force by age 35, the percent-
age with education levels in the upper quartile of the
income distribution and the median age of first marriage.
Using this definition, they demonstrated that the narrow-
ing sex differences in the prevalence of substance use dis-
orders across birth cohorts were strongest in those
countries where female and male roles were converging
over time. Beyond the impact of changing gender role
traditionality, some have suggested that broader social,
cultural and economic developments explain converging
patterns of substance use in males and females.87 The
large-scale GENACIS (Gender, Alcohol and Culture: An
International Study) project has shown that sex differ-
ences in alcohol use are linked, albeit in complex ways, to
greater engagement by females in paid employment
outside the home.12 In a novel examination of gener-
ational changes in female drinking over a period of three
decades, Alati et al88 demonstrated that the daughters of
1053 mother/daughter dyads had more than five times
the odds of heavy drinking than their mothers had at the
same age. Moreover, they demonstrated that this increase
was partly accounted for by later age at childbearing thus
providing much needed direct evidence on potential
mechanisms driving the generational increase in alcohol
consumption.
These results have implications for the framing and
targeting of alcohol use prevention and intervention
programmes. Alcohol use and alcohol use disorders
have historically been viewed as a male phenomenon.
The present study calls this assumption into question
and suggests that young women in particular should be
the target of concerted efforts to reduce the impact of
substance use and related harms. Those born in the
most recent cohorts (ie, the 1990s) can, by definition,
only have a maximum age of between 15 and 25. That
the birth cohort effect on sex ratios has become more
pronounced in these recent birth cohorts points to the
value of continuing to focus research on adolescent and
young adult sex-specific trends in substance use. Given
that this young age group are relatively early in their
alcohol use careers, these findings highlight the import-
ance of further tracking young male and female cohorts
as they age into their 30s, 40s and beyond.
