The American Academy of Pediatrics is dedicated to optimizing the well-
being of children and advancing family-centered health care. Related to 
this mission, the American Academy of Pediatrics recognizes the increasing 
use of complementary and integrative therapies for children and the 
subsequent need to provide reliable information and high-quality clinical 
resources to support pediatricians. This Clinical Report serves as an update 
to the original 2008 statement on complementary medicine. The range of 
complementary therapies is both extensive and diverse. Therefore, in-depth 
discussion of each therapy or product is beyond the scope of this report. 
Instead, our intentions are to define terms; describe epidemiology of use; 
outline common types of complementary therapies; review medicolegal, 
ethical, and research implications; review education and training for select 
providers of complementary therapies; provide educational resources; and 
suggest communication strategies for discussing complementary therapies 
with patients and families.

CLINICAL REPORT
The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) 
of the National Institutes of Health (NIH)1 defines complementary 
therapies as evidence-based health care approaches developed outside 
of conventional Western medicine that are used in conjunction with 
conventional care. Examples of complementary care include the use of 
acupuncture to treat migraine headache2 and clinical hypnosis to improve 
symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).3 The term integrative health 
describes the blending of complementary and conventional therapies by 
the practitioner to include all appropriate therapies in a patient-centered 
and evidence-informed fashion. In an integrative approach, evidence-
based complementary therapies may be used as primary treatments or 
used in combination with conventional therapies. In contrast, alternative 
therapies are not evidence-based, are used in place of conventional care, 
and are not covered in this report.
Interest in the field of pediatric integrative medicine is driven by a 
number of factors, including the prevalence of use in children living with 
chronic illness,

prescription medication use, and the 
need for more effective approaches 
to preventive health in children.6, 
 
7  
To date, consumer interest in and 
use of complementary therapies 
has outpaced training options in 
pediatric integrative medicine, 
leaving pediatricians with a desire 
for more training and familiarity 
with resources.8 For example, a 
2012 survey of academic pediatric 
training programs revealed that only 
16 of 143 programs reported having 
an integrative medicine program.8 
National initiatives to introduce 
pediatric integrative medicine into 
conventional pediatric residency 
training include programs such as 
the Pediatric Integrative Medicine 
in Residency program through the 
University of Arizona, initiated in 
2012.9 Other teaching initiatives are 
underway through the American 
Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Section 
on Integrative Medicine and through 
academic institutions affiliated 
with the Academic Consortium for 
Integrative Medicine and Health 
(ACIMH), a prestigious organization 
of more than 65 medical schools that 
offer integrative medicine research, 
education, and clinical initiatives (eg, 
Harvard, Yale, Duke, Stanford).10 This 
Clinical Report serves as an update 
to the original 2008 statement on 
complementary medicine.11
EpIDEmIOlOgy
Overview
Results of the 2012 National Health 
Interview Survey (NHIS) revealed 
that the prevalence of children <18 
years using complementary therapies 
remained approximately 12% in 
the preceding 5 years, 
12 reflecting 
the fact that more than 1 in every 
10 children had used some form 
of complementary therapy in the 
preceding year. In both the 2007 
and 2012 NHIS, complementary 
approaches were used most often for 
back or neck pain, head or chest cold, 
other musculoskeletal conditions, 
anxiety or stress, and attention-
deficit/hyperactivity disorder 
(ADHD) and were more often chosen 
to treat a specific condition rather 
than to promote general well-
being.12 Nonvitamin, nonmineral 
dietary supplements (eg, herbal 
medicines, probiotics), osteopathic 
or chiropractic manipulation, and 
yoga, tai chi, or qigong were the 
complementary therapies used 
most frequently by children in both 
the 2007 and 2012 NHIS.12 Zhang 
et al13 conducted a study in which 
they used data from the Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) and 
Infant Practices Feeding Study II of 
the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, and they showed that 
9% of infants, including newborn 
infants, received dietary botanical 
supplements or teas in the first year 
of life.
Use in Chronic Illness
The use of complementary therapies 
increases to >50% in children 
living with chronic illness, 
6, 
 
12, 
 
14 
– 
18 
with the most common category 
of complementary therapy being 
natural health products.12 Children 
with multiple chronic conditions or 
greater functional disability from 
their chronic illness were more  
likely to use complementary 
therapies.5, 
14, 
 
19, 
 
20 Data from the 
National Comorbidity Survey 
Replication Adolescent Supplement 
revealed that for youth with 
any psychiatric disorder, 5.3% 
received mental health services in 
a complementary medicine setting 
within the past 12 months.21
In a study of 926 children attending 
10 Canadian pediatric outpatient 
specialty clinics (cardiology, 
gastroenterology, neurology, 
oncology, and respiratory), Adams 
et al4 showed that the prevalence of 
pediatric complementary therapy 
use reached up to 70%. Prevalence 
increased in older age groups and 
with severity of illness.4 The top 
conditions for which children used 
complementary therapies included 
various heart disorders, Crohn 
disease, colitis, celiac disease, 
epilepsy, headache, migraine, 
cerebral palsy, leukemia, asthma, 
cystic fibrosis, and other respiratory 
disorders. The most common 
complementary treatments used 
by this study population included 
vitamins and minerals, massage, and 
homeopathic treatments.4
Use in Adolescents
Both the 2007 and 2012 NHIS results 
revealed that adolescents (ages 
12–17 years) were more likely to 
use complementary therapies than 
younger children (ages 4–11 years).12 
In numerous reports, researchers 
have described the frequent use 
of complementary therapies by 
adolescents, 
22 
– 
26 including those 
living with chronic illnesses  
such as IBS, juvenile idiopathic 
arthritis, 
27, 
 
28 and a range of mental 
health conditions.21
Adolescents use supplements to 
lose weight, increase energy, and 
improve their body image or athletic 
performance, among other reasons. 
Commonly used dietary supplements 
in this age group include ginseng, 
zinc, echinacea, ginkgo, weight 
loss supplements, and creatine.29 
The primary influences for use of 
complementary therapies among 
adolescents include their use by 
a family member and targeted 
marketing and advertising on 
television and the Internet.30
High prevalence of Use, High Out-of-
pocket Costs
The 2012 NHIS showed that the 
prevalence of adult complementary 
medicine use in the preceding 
year remained steady at 33.2%, 
(approximately 1 in 3) compared 
with 35.5% in the 2007 survey.18 
This accounts for an estimated 354 
million visits to complementary 
medicine practitioners and an 
estimated 835 million individual 
purchases of products, classes, and

Downloaded from 
 materials. According to the 2012 
NHIS, an estimated 59 million adults 
spent $30.2 billion out of pocket 
(with $1.9 billion spent on children) 
for complementary medicine 
practitioners and purchases of 
complementary medicine products, 
classes, and materials in the 
preceding year, an estimated 1.1% of 
total health care costs in the United 
States and up to 9.2% of out-of-
pocket health care expenditures in 
2012.31
predictors of Complementary 
medicine Use and low Disclosure 
Rates
Parental use of complementary 
medicine remains one of the 
most consistent predictors of 
complementary medicine use 
in children.12 Other important 
predictors of complementary 
medicine use in children include 
higher parental education, higher 
family income, living in the western 
United States, and higher number 
of physician visits in the preceding 
year.6 Adults have been shown 
to be more likely to discuss use 
of complementary therapies for 
themselves and their children if their 
physician is perceived as having 
patient-centered communication 
and specifically inquires about use, 
32 
reinforcing the key message of asking 
patients about all therapies in use to 
reduce of potential supplement-drug 
interactions and to promote greater 
trust between parent and physician.8
pATIEnT CHARACTERIsTICs
The use of complementary therapies 
spans the socioeconomic spectrum 
and varies considerably among 
cultural and ethnic groups.19, 
 
20, 
 
33  
According to the 2012 NHIS, non-
Hispanic African American and 
Hispanic children have the lowest 
use of complementary therapies 
in the United States.12 Researchers 
in several studies have indicated 
that complementary medicine 
use among children may be 
underreported because certain 
ethnic populations are less likely to 
disclose the use of these practices 
to their providers.34 
– 
36 This may be 
in part because many cultures do 
not see their indigenous practices as 
“complementary”; rather, they are 
viewed as traditional approaches to 
health and health care indigenous to 
their culture. Language barriers may 
result in underrepresentation of non-
English speakers because many of the 
large population-based surveys are 
conducted only in English.37 Reasons 
for the use of complementary 
medicine vary and include alignment 
with family or patient beliefs, fear 
of adverse drug effects, supporting 
conventional treatments, and desire 
to improve overall health.11, 
38 Data 
from the 2007 NHIS showed that 
patients who delayed conventional 
care because of financial constraints 
were also more likely to use 
complementary therapies.39
pHysICIAn AwAREnEss, ATTITUDE, 
AnD pERCEpTIOn
In the 2001 AAP Periodic Survey 
number 49, “Complementary and 
Alternative Therapies in Pediatric 
Practice, 
” most pediatricians (72.8%) 
agreed they should provide patients 
with information about all potential 
treatment options but reported 
they had little or no knowledge 
of complementary or alternative 
therapies. They recognized patients’ 
frequent use of these therapies 
and expressed a strong desire for 
additional education on topics, 
including herbs, dietary supplements, 
special diets, and exercise.40 More 
than one-third of the pediatricians 
reported that they or their families 
personally used some type of 
complementary therapy. Of those 
reporting complementary therapy 
use, 70% used massage therapy, 
21% received chiropractic care, 
13.5% consulted a spiritual or 
religious healer, and 13% had used 
acupuncture.41 In a 2005 report, the 
Institute of Medicine42 stated that 
health care professionals needed to 
be informed about complementary 
therapies and to be knowledgeable 
enough to discuss them with their 
patients. It also advocated that 
conventional health care professional 
training programs (eg, schools of 
medicine, nursing, pharmacy, and 
allied health) should incorporate 
sufficient information about 
complementary therapies into their 
curricula to enable licensed health 
care professionals to competently 
advise their patients about the 
various options.42 As of 2012, only 
16 of the 143 academic pediatric 
programs surveyed in the United 
States reported having pediatric 
integrative medicine programs.8 As 
of 2015, 50% of US medical school 
Web sites (n = 130) listed at least 
1 course or clerkship offering in 
complementary and alternative 
medicine (CAM).43 These offerings 
embraced a wide range of topics 
and instructional methods. Although 
the extent to which pediatric 
residencies and postgraduate 
courses address educational needs 
about complementary therapies is 
unknown, 
44 
–47 there is a growing 
number of Web-based educational 
training resources in the area of 
pediatric integrative medicine, 
including the AAP Section on 
Integrative Medicine48 and the 
Pediatric Complementary and 
Alternative Medicine Research 
and Education Network.49 Since 
2012, a growing number of 
academic pediatric integrative 
medicine programs have offered a 
complementary therapy curriculum 
to medical students and residents 
as part of their standard medical 
education.9 In the United States, 
board certification in integrative 
medicine is now offered to eligible 
candidates through the American 
Board of Physician Specialties.50

nIH: nCCIH
The Office of Alternative Medicine 
was established as part of the NIH 
by congressional mandate in 1992. 
In 1998, the Office of Alternative 
Medicine became the National Center 
for Complementary and Alternative 
Medicine, and in 2014 the name 
was changed to the National Center 
for Complementary and Integrative 
Health. The NCCIH has increased 
its fiscal-year appropriations from 
$50 million in 1998 to an estimated 
$124 million in 2014 (∼0.4% of 
the total NIH budget).1 In the early 
years, NCCIH’s focus on research 
emphasized the importance of basic 
and clinical research as the core of 
building the evidence base for CAM.
In 2005, at the request of the NIH 
and the Agency for Healthcare 
Research and Quality, the Institute 
of Medicine (now known as the 
National Academy of Medicine) 
released the report “Complementary 
and Alternative Medicine in the 
United States.” The report assessed 
what is known about Americans’ 
reliance on complementary 
therapies and assisted the NIH in 
developing research methods and 
setting priorities for evaluating such 
products and therapies. It advocated 
that conventional medical treatments 
and complementary and alternative 
treatments be held to the same 
standards for demonstrating clinical 
effectiveness.42
The 2016 NCCIH strategic plan 
identified 5 core objectives and 6 top 
scientific priorities and they are as 
follows.51
Objectives
1. Advance fundamental science and 
methods development;
2. improve care for hard-to-manage 
symptoms;
3. foster health promotion and 
disease prevention;
4. enhance the complementary 
and integrative health research 
workforce; and
5. disseminate objective 
evidence-based information on 
complementary and integrative 
health interventions.
Top scientific priorities
 
• Nonpharmacologic management 
of pain;
 
• neurobiological effects and 
mechanisms;
 
• innovative approaches for 
establishing biological signatures 
of natural products;
 
• clinical trials utilizing innovative 
study designs to assess 
complementary health;
 
• disease prevention and health 
promotion across the lifespan;
 
• clinical trials utilizing innovative 
study designs to assess 
complementary health approaches 
and their integration into health 
care; and
 
• communications strategies and 
tools to enhance scientific literacy 
and understanding of clinical 
research.
The NCCIH divides the various 
complementary therapies into 1 of 
2 main subgroups: natural products 
or mind and body practices. Natural 
products include botanicals, vitamins 
and minerals, and probiotics as 
a group (also widely known as 
dietary supplements). Mind and 
body practices include acupuncture, 
relaxation techniques, tai chi, 
qigong, healing touch, hypnotherapy, 
and movement therapies. A third 
category, other complementary 
heath approaches, includes practices 
such as traditional Chinese medicine 
(TCM), Ayurvedic medicine, 
homeopathy, and naturopathy 
(https://

nih.

health#types).
REsEARCH
Pediatric integrative medicine 
involves the integration of 
complementary and conventional 
therapies on the basis of the best 
available data, with the goal of 
maximizing therapeutic benefit to 
the patient. Ideally, an approach to 
the integration of complementary 
therapies into practice would 
depend on the same evidenced-
based decision-making used for 
conventional therapies, with 
the understanding that in both 
instances, evidence available for 
particular therapies in specific 
clinical situations may be variable. 
That said, formal expert evaluation 
has suggested that the quality 
of randomized controlled trials 
(RCTs) of CAM is as good as that of 
RCTs of conventional medicine52 
and that the quality of systematic 
reviews of CAM exceeds that of 
conventional medicine.53 In addition, 
publication bias in complementary 
medicine research is opposite that 
of conventional medicine; that is, 
negative studies are more likely to 
be published in well-known journals, 
and positive studies are more likely 
to be published in foreign language 
journals.53
There are some unique 
considerations when conducting 
research on the efficacy of 
complementary therapies, including 
underlying theories, which may seem 
quite disparate from the conventional 
model, and heterogeneity of both 
products and practices. Some 
complementary therapies have 
traditions that date back thousands 
of years, which generates evidence 
of an iterative, experiential type. 
In recognition of the variety and 
value of different types of evidence, 
research studies to measure the 
effect of such complementary 
therapies should be designed to test 
the therapy within the context of 
its tradition. Rigorous N-of-1 trials 
(clinical trials in which a single 
patient receives both experimental

 and control intervention) are 
particularly useful for the evaluation 
of individualized therapies used in 
CAM. One useful N-of-1 resource 
can be found through the Agency 
for Healthcare Research and Quality 
monograph.54
To be comprehensive, high-
quality data about both safety and 
effectiveness are needed. Most 
current safety data consist of case 
reports identified through passive 
surveillance, with little known about 
the true denominator of the number 
of people receiving the treatment 
and considerable concern about 
underreporting of the numerator. 
Researchers in a number of reviews 
of provider-delivered therapies have 
found reassuring evidence regarding 
the safety of complementary 
therapies.55, 
 
56 Although the need 
for rigorous safety evaluation is 
questioned by some who perceive 
“natural” as equivalent to “safe, 
” to 
support patient-centered integration 
of therapies, more rigorous data 
on safety are needed. In addition, 
in contrast to pharmaceuticals, 
there are limited requirements to 
demonstrate safety before marketing 
natural products, resulting in little 
motivation for detailed safety work 
from the manufacturer standpoint. 
Although consumer interest in 
complementary therapies continues 
to increase, there remains an 
important unmet need to develop 
rigorous safety data to inform policy 
and practice.
Although there are numerous 
challenges inherent in all clinical 
research, these difficulties are 
compounded when performing 
research in children and on 
therapies based on different 
theoretical approaches to health 
and well-being. The use of rigorous 
scientific methods to study the use 
of complementary therapies from 
other healing traditions has been 
greatly encouraged and supported by 
the NCCIH. Although much progress 
has been made, there remain 
significant opportunities to expand 
the evidence base for the integration 
of complementary therapies in our 
care of children. A useful research 
resource includes a data query 
and research resource Web site 
developed by the Data Resource 
Center for Child and Adolescent 
Health (http:// 
www. 
childhealthdata. 
org/ 
learn/ 
nhis) to facilitate access to 
the data on CAM from the 2007 and 
2012 NHIS (Fig 1).57
One issue that must be considered in 
all research, both conventional and 
complementary, is the placebo effect, 
a sophisticated psychobiological 
event that operates on multiple levels 
of the therapeutic relationship. It has 
been shown to involve conditioning, 
learning, memory, motivation, 
reward, and patient expectancy on 
the basis of interactions with the 
clinician.
It has been established that the 
placebo effect is real and holds 
significant therapeutic potential, 
although many questions remain 
about how best to harness the

REgUlATIOn OF DIETARy 
sUpplEmEnTs
Concerns exist about the purity 
and potency of herbal products and 
other dietary supplements sold in 
the United States, in part because of 
regulations that differ from those 
governing the use of pharmaceuticals. 
The Dietary Supplements Health and 
Education Act (DSHEA) of 199459 
amended previous FDA statutes to 
encompass dietary supplement–
specific provisions, including the 
definition of a “dietary supplement” 
as food and not a drug, product 
safety, nutritional statements and 
claims, ingredient and nutritional 
labeling, good manufacturing 
procedures, and the classification of 
“new” dietary ingredients.59 Under 
the DSHEA, a dietary supplement is 
the following59:
 
• "a product (other than tobacco) 
intended to supplement the diet 
that bears or contains 1 or more 
of the following ingredients: a 
vitamin, a mineral, an herb or other 
botanical, or an amino acid;
 
• intended for ingestion in pill, 
capsule, tablet, or liquid form;
 
• not used as a conventional food or 
as the sole item of a meal or diet; 
and
 
• labeled as a dietary supplement."
In contrast, dietary supplements 
in Canada are regulated through 
Health Canada’s Natural and 
Non-prescription Health Products 
Directorate, formerly known 
as the Natural Health Products 
Directorate. Products manufactured 
or distributed in Canada are required 
to have a product license by Health 
Canada, certifying premarket safety, 
efficacy, and quality.60
The FDA can demonstrate that a 
supplement is unsafe only after it 
reaches the market and must prove 
that the product is unsafe before it 
can restrict a product’s use or take 
other legal action. The FDA relies 
largely on the MedWatch voluntary 
reporting system to collect safety 
data on dietary supplements.61
The DSHEA also regulates third-
party literature regarding dietary 
supplements. Informational materials 
(ie, articles, fact sheets) may be 
displayed in commercial retail 
sites provided they are displayed 
separately from the product, do 
not contain false or misleading 
information, and do not promote a 
specific brand of supplement. Quality 
and standardization of natural health 
products also significantly affect 
research, in which reproducibility of 
results is a critical factor.
Perhaps most importantly, the 
DSHEA regulates the labeling of 
dietary supplements. Under this 
provision, any claims to prevent, 
treat, or cure a specific disease 
are expressly prohibited (unless 
approved by the FDA). Labels can 
include statements describing 
the supplement’s effects on the 
“structure and function” or general 
“well-being” of the body as long 
as they are truthful and bear the 
statement, “This statement has not 
been evaluated by the Food and 
Drug Administration. This product 
is not intended to diagnose, treat, 
cure, or prevent any disease.” 
59 
Just as with food products, dietary 
supplements are allowed to have 
suggested dosages on the label and 
must bear nutritional labeling. The 
label must include the name and 
quantity of each dietary ingredient, 
and if the ingredient is botanical 
in origin, the label must state the 
part of the plant from which the 
ingredient is derived.59 To maximize 
patient safety, all primary care 
providers should be knowledgeable 
about correct labeling of dietary 
supplements.62,

Uncertainty about the scope of 
practice, licensing requirements, 
and credentialing of complementary 
medicine providers are common 
concerns, as are concerns about 
patient safety and legal liability when 
recommending complementary 
therapies or therapists.
licensing
Licensing information about health 
care professionals who are not 
doctors of medicine or doctors of 
osteopathic medicine is maintained 
by state licensing boards and shows 
significant state-to-state variation. 
As with physicians, regulations, 
licenses, or certificates do not 
guarantee safe, effective treatment 
from any provider.64 Local and 
state governments and professional 
organizations generally establish 
the credentials that complementary 
health providers need to treat 
patients.
Chiropractic is licensed in all 50 
states.65 Acupuncture66 and massage 
therapy are licensed in more than 
half of the states.67 At the time 
of writing, 17 states, 5 Canadian 
provinces, the District of Columbia, 
and the US territories of Puerto Rico 
and the US Virgin Islands all have 
laws regulating naturopaths.68 Only 
3 states currently offer licensing to 
doctors of medicine and doctors of 
osteopathic medicine to practice 
homeopathy (Arizona, Nevada, 
and Connecticut).69 It is essential 
for physicians to understand local 
and state statutes and regulations 
governing specific therapeutic 
modalities.70,

Informed Consent
As the evidence base grows and 
standard of care evolves, some 
complementary therapy modalities 
may need to be included in 
discussions about informed consent 
for treatment. The informed consent 
process may require a discussion 
about potential benefits and harms 
associated with complementary 
therapies, notwithstanding the 
ability of a patient to acquire 
complementary treatments without 
the involvement of the pediatrician. 
An example is the practice of 
inquiring about dietary supplement 
use and discussing its potential 
benefit and harms. Ideally, the 
primary care provider will inquire 
about any complementary medicine 
use at every patient visit.35
Life-threatening Conditions
Pediatricians also need to be aware 
of alternative therapies that may be 
used as a substitute for conventional 
medical care for children with life-
threatening conditions and decide 
whether they believe such treatment 
is reportable under state abuse and 
neglect laws.72 Another legal duty of 
pediatricians relates to the assurance 
that seeking reimbursement for 
complementary therapy does not 
trigger a potential violation of fraud 
and abuse laws for therapy deemed 
“medically unnecessary.” Ultimately, 
it is prudent to be cautious about 
any representations or guarantees. 
In certain circumstances, charging 
patients directly for services may 
violate medical insurance or system 
contracts; therefore, individual 
primary care providers should 
apprise themselves of rules and 
regulations relevant to their specific 
practice model.
Ethical Considerations
Uncertainty about how to translate 
principles of medical ethics into 
integrative medicine is another 
common area of confusion. Primary 
care providers should know that case 
law has placed a burden on them to 
discuss viable options of treatment 
although they may be unwilling to 
offer the therapy.73
The first guideline of ethical practice 
is to seek reliable, evidence-based 
information about the safety and 
effectiveness of specific therapies 
and therapists, although the specific 
ethical questions in clinical practice 
vary in different clinical situations. If 
a therapy is both safe and effective, 
the pediatrician is ethically required 
to discuss its use as he or she 
would for any other such therapy in 
conventional care.74
The 2001 AAP Policy Statement, 
“Counseling Families Who Choose 
Complementary and Alternative 
Medicine for Their Child With 
Chronic Illness or Disability, 
” was 
reaffirmed in 2010 and continues to 
recommend that pediatricians seek 
information, evaluate the scientific 
merits of specific therapeutic 
approaches, and identify risks 
or potential harmful effects.75 
Pediatricians may want to be familiar 
with the complementary medicine 
providers in their area so that 
they are able to advise patients on 
providers who are appropriately 
working within their scope of 
practice.42 Similarly, pediatricians 
are encouraged to advise parents 
and patients about the importance of 
establishing the safety and quality of 
any product sold in a complementary 
medicine provider’s office or in any 
commercial venue.
A common-sense guide to balancing 
risks and benefits when making 
therapeutic decisions provides 
a framework for decision-
making surrounding treatment 
recommendations.76
Factors to be included in a risk/
benefit analysis when considering 
complementary and integrative 
therapies are the severity and 
acuteness of illness; curability 
with conventional care; degree of 
invasiveness; toxicities and adverse 
effects of conventional treatment; 
quality of evidence for efficacy and 
safety of the complementary therapy; 
and the family’s understanding of the 
risks and benefits of the treatment, 
voluntary acceptance of those risks, 
and persistence of the family’s 
intention to use complementary or 
integrative therapy (Fig 2).77, 
 
78
The level of evidence required for 
evaluating efficacy can be small 
when there is little to no risk of 
harm from a therapy, especially 
when other therapies are likely to be 
futile. Likewise, the level of evidence 
for efficacy required to endorse a 
particular complementary therapy 
would be quite high when that

 therapy is risky and when safer, more 
effective therapies are available.
Situation-specific variables can also 
affect ethical decision-making. For 
example, the patient’s and parents’ 
personal beliefs, cultural values and 
practices, and therapeutic goals; 
the type and severity of illness; 
and the lack of efficacy and safety 
data in a specific patient can affect 
the decision to use complementary 
therapy. Even when such data 
are known for other populations, 
application of population data to 
individual pediatric patients requires 
inference and implies some degree 
of uncertainty. The tolerance of the 
patient, family, and primary care 
provider for uncertainty varies from 
one situation to another.79 As experts 
in assessing safety and efficacy, 
pediatricians’ input into treatment 
decisions is critical in enabling 
families to make the best evidence-
based decisions regarding these 
therapies.
Informed consent for any proposed 
treatment includes a discussion of 
the risks, benefits, and reasonable 
alternatives. Failure to discuss 
reasonable alternatives can create 
legal risk for a physician.73 Although 
courts have not yet ruled that failure 
to offer reasonable complementary 
medicine alternatives is actionable, 
the potential for liability exists. 
Children should be allowed to 
participate in their care and 
decision-making in a manner that is 
appropriate and specified by state 
law; most states have very specific 
laws regarding age for assent for 
treatment.
Finally, primary care providers 
should be aware of and apply the 4 
basic principles of biomedical ethics 
as described by Beauchamp and 
Childress: (1) respect for patients’ 
autonomy, (2) nonmaleficence 
(avoiding harm), (3) beneficence 
(putting the patient’s interest and 
well-being first), and (4) justice 
(fairness in providing access to 
essential care).42
In summary, if recommending 
complementary therapies, 
pediatricians are strongly 
encouraged to use an evidence-
informed approach and give due 
consideration to issues of liability 
with relation to patient referral 
and/or a shared-care approach to 
treatment. A 2011 series in Pediatrics 
on legal and ethical issues pertaining 
to pediatric complementary  
and integrative medicine provides  
an excellent foundation of 
information on licensing and 
other specific medicolegal 
considerations.64,

TRAInIng AnD EDUCATIOn
Training in Complementary 
Therapies
Many complementary therapy 
providers provide care for children; 
however, most are trained as 
generalists in their fields. Pediatric 
specialty training is the exception, 
not the rule, in most CAM disciplines. 
The Committee on the Use of 
Complementary and Alternative 
Medicine by the American Public 
recommends that the national 
professional organizations for all 
CAM disciplines ensure the presence 
of training standards and develop 
practice guidelines. Ideally, health 
care professional licensing boards 
and accrediting and certifying 
agencies (for both complementary 
and conventional medicine) should 
set competency standards in the 
appropriate use of both conventional 
medicine and complementary 
therapies, consistent with 
practitioners’ scope of practice and 
standards of referral across health 
professions.42
medical Education in Integrative 
medicine
Despite high demand for integrative 
care, 
42 a lack of systematic education 
about the safety and effectiveness 
of complementary and integrative 
therapies in pediatrics still exists.9 
One example of educational 
initiatives underway in pediatric 
integrative medicine to fill this gap 
is the Pediatric Integrative Medicine 
in Residency program, a 100-hour 
online educational curriculum 
that was implemented as a pilot 
in 5 pediatric residency training 
programs in the United States, and 
in 2016 it reached >500 residents 
nationally and internationally.9 
Osteopathic physicians receive 
extensive training in integrative 
medicine with regard to osteopathic 
principles and osteopathic 
manipulative treatment (OMT).
Other opportunities include 
online case-based training44, 
 
46 and 
educational courses at national 
meetings of the AAP through the 
Section on Integrative Medicine and 
collaborating sections and a variety 
of educational resources through

THERApIEs
What follows is an overview of 
each of these categories with 
resources for further reading, 
rather than an exhaustive review 
of individual therapies. The level of 
evidence evaluating the use of these 
therapies varies greatly. For some 
interventions, there are numerous 
high-quality investigations, but for 
others the data are sparser. It is 
important for individuals to weigh 
the best available evidence and risk/
benefit ratio for any intervention 
used in children, either conventional 
or complementary.

It may be most important for the 
pediatrician to recognize that 
thousands of natural health products 
exist, many are routinely marketed to 
children and adolescents, hundreds 
of studies have been published in this 
area, good sources of synthesized 
information exist, and consistent 
caution is needed in assessing quality 
of natural health products and their 
potential for adverse interactions 
with prescription or over-the-counter 
medications.
Parents may use natural products 
for their children for a variety 
of reasons, including a desire to 
avoid prescription medication or a 
preference for a natural approach 
to preventive health.6 Despite the 
fact that natural health products 
may be perceived as safe because 
of their natural origins, researchers 
have demonstrated the potential for 
serious toxicity and possible adverse 
reactions or events, especially 
in patients taking prescription 
medications concurrently.85 
Compounding this risk is the fact 
that safety standards that specifically 
address the pediatric population 
are lacking, 
86 and parents may 
be reluctant to disclose the use of 
natural products for fear of censure 
or ridicule.6 Failure of pharmacists 
and physicians to routinely inquire 
about natural health product use is 
another significant compounder.86 
Another challenge in this area is 
widespread reliance on passive 
surveillance systems that depend on 
health care providers or consumers 
to recognize and appropriately 
report adverse reactions, which may 
result in a serious underestimation of 
adverse reactions.86
One useful resource for primary 
care providers to address some 
of these concerns is the natural 
health products–drug interaction 
grid developed by Complementary 
and Alternative Research and 
Education Program.87 Additional 
high-quality resources on drug–
natural product interactions include 
these subscription natural product 
databases:
 
• Natural Medicines (formerly 
Natural Standard and Natural 
Medicines Comprehensive 
Database)88; and
 
• ConsumerLab.com.
Dietary supplements Commonly 
Used in Children
Fish Oil
The 2012 NHIS results revealed that 
fish oil is one of the most commonly 
used natural products in children. 
Docosahexaenoic acid found in 
fish oil has convincing evidence for 
supporting full-term gestation and 
is integral in the development of 
the brain, nervous system, retina, 
testes, and renal cortex.89 It has also 
been associated with improvement 
of symptoms of neuropsychiatric 
disorders, such as ADHD in some 
children, with minimal adverse 
effects noted.90, 
 
91
Melatonin
Melatonin is another commonly 
cited dietary supplement in the 
NHIS in children. Melatonin is 
primarily produced by the pineal 
gland and is closely regulated by 
the suprachiasmatic nucleus, which 
regulates the sleep-wake cycle. 
Melatonin is used for functional 
sleep disorders to decrease sleep 
latency and in some children with 
neurodevelopmental disorders 
who have associated sleep 
disturbances.92 
– 
94 Despite wide use, 
long-term studies on the safety and 
efficacy of pediatric melatonin use 
are lacking.
Probiotics
Probiotics are a third commonly used 
category of dietary supplements. 
Probiotics are live microorganisms 
that offer benefit to their host.95 
In children, some probiotic strains 
have been demonstrated to shorten 
the duration of acute infectious 
diarrhea96 and to decrease functional 
abdominal pain symptoms in 
some children.97 Other important 
applications of probiotics and/ 
prebiotics include the prevention 
of atopic dermatitis in predisposed 
children.98 Evidence supporting the 
use of probiotics in the prevention 
of necrotizing enterocolitis99 and 
late-onset sepsis in preterm infants is 
strong and continues to accrue.100
Well-designed RCTs are expanding 
the evidence on natural products in a 
variety of other pediatric conditions, 
including the following: pain, 
headaches, ADHD, asthma, atopic 
disease, and colic, 
101 among others.
Herbal products
There are a number of excellent 
review articles on the use of 
herbal products in pediatric 
populations.102 
– 
109 As with other 
natural products, due caution must 
be taken with herbal remedies, 
especially for individuals with 
allergic reactions to certain plants. 
Recognition and avoidance of 
potential herb-drug interactions will 
help pediatricians optimize patient 
safety.110
An example of a potential serious 
interaction includes the combination 
of prescription drugs with St. John’s 
wort, which can affect therapeutic 
dose of medications that are 
substrates of cytochrome P450s 
and/or P-glycoprotein, such as oral 
contraceptives, anticoagulants, 
calcium-channel blockers, digoxin, 
and benzodiazepenes.111
Another potential problem is seen in 
the aggressive marketing of energy 
drinks to adolescents. Many brands 
contain dietary supplements in 
addition to high levels of caffeine and 
sugar.112 The AAP Clinical Report 
on sports drinks and energy drinks 
encourages pediatricians to screen 
for use of energy drinks and hidden 
sources of dietary supplements and 
to provide education to youth and

Diet
The use of diets with what have 
been termed “functional foods” 
is an evolving research topic in 
pediatrics. One familiar example is 
the ketogenic diet, used for children 
with refractory and severe epilepsy, 
which has shown benefit in seizure 
control in some children comparable 
to antiepileptic drugs.114 Elimination 
diets have been studied in IBS, 
115 
gastrointestinal food sensitivities  
or allergies, 
116 atopic disease, 
117  
ADHD, 
118 autism spectrum  
disorders, 
119 and migraines.120 A 
common concern about each of these 
types of diets are the risks of macro 
and micronutrient deficiencies.
A newer area of nutrition research in 
pediatrics is the use of the balanced 
Mediterranean diet pattern as a 
preventive tool in childhood obesity 
and its associated comorbidities, 
such as cardiovascular disease and 
metabolic syndrome.121 A protective 
effect of the Mediterranean diet has 
also been noted against asthma, 
rhinitis, and eczema in certain 
pediatric populations.122 
– 
124 Larger-
scale studies are needed, including 
assessment of long-term outcomes of 
various diets in children.
manipulative, movement, and Body-
Based practices
The most commonly used 
manipulative, movement, and 
body-based practices in pediatrics 
include osteopathic manipulation, 
chiropractic, and massage.1 
According to the most recent NHIS, 
3.3% of US children (1.9 million) 
used chiropractic or osteopathic 
spinal manipulation in 2012.12, 
 
125 
Yoga is a popular movement therapy 
also widely considered a mind-body–
based practice11 and is discussed 
under the Mind-Body Therapies 
section of this report. Research 
on manipulative, movement, and 
body-based practices in children or 
adolescents is limited and available 
mostly for osteopathic manipulation, 
chiropractic, and massage. The 
studies primarily consist of case 
reports or small series with only 
a handful of small RCTs. A brief 
overview of the modalities follows.
Osteopathic medicine, practiced by 
those who have earned Doctor of 
Osteopathic Medicine (DO) degrees, 
emphasizes preventative medicine 
and holistic care.126 In addition, 
OMT, a form of manual manipulation, 
is taught to all osteopathic 
medical students, emphasizing the 
importance of maintaining healthy 
muscle and lymphatic balance. DOs 
incorporate OMT to varying degrees 
in clinical practice, although it has 
been established that many DOs do 
not use OMT regularly in their  
care of patients.127 Historically, 
osteopathic medicine has emerged 
as a separate discipline but has been 
accepted as an effective treatment 
modality in today’s health care 
climate in the United States.128, 
 
129  
Although a small community of 
DOs maintains that osteopathy is a 
distinct discipline, 
128 most consider 
OMT to be conventional therapy. 
The AAP Section on Osteopathic 
Pediatricians serves as an important 
resource for further education and 
evidence-based study in osteopathic 
medicine and provides an overview 
of evidence-based research (https://

Some chiropractors limit care to 
primarily musculoskeletal issues, 
but others see patients for wide 
variety of concerns. Infants and 
children are seen by chiropractors 
for many different reasons. A bias 
against childhood vaccinations has 
been shown to exist in chiropractic 
care; children 1 through 17 years 
of age in the care of a chiropractic 
practitioner were significantly less 
likely to receive recommended 
vaccinations, leading to higher risk 
of vaccine-preventable disease.130 
The AAP supports interventions to 
increase immunization awareness 
and recommends that primary care 
providers encourage and support 
families in fully immunizing children. 
High-quality evidence supporting 
effectiveness of spinal manipulation 
for nonmusculoskeletal concerns 
is lacking, especially in infants and 
children, for whom the risks of 
adverse events may be the highest 
because of immature stability of the 
spine.56
Safety and Adverse Events
Serious complications are possible 
with chiropractic treatment of 
children, but such adverse effects 
are rare and related to high-velocity, 
extension, and rotational spinal 
manipulation.56, 
 
131 It is essential that 
any known preexisting underlying 
pathology be discussed and an age-
appropriate, thorough history and 
physical examination be conducted 
to exclude abnormal anatomic or 
neurologic findings before any type 
of manual or manipulative therapy 
is used on a child or adolescent.132 
Prospective population-based 
active surveillance is recommended 
to accurately assess the rates of 
adverse events related to manual and 
manipulative therapies in children.56 
Studies are ongoing.
Massage
Massage therapy is a common body-
based practice often provided at 
home by parents to children and 
by licensed massage therapists and 
nurses in clinical settings. According 
to the latest NHIS, approximately 
0.7% of US children (n = 385 000) 
used massage therapy, 
12 which 
seems to be the same number as in 
many other countries.132 Massage 
has become routine practice in 
many NICUs and has been shown to 
promote weight gain, growth, and 
development in preterm infants133, 
 
134  
and may lead to shorter hospital 
stays and, thus, cost savings.135

mind-Body Therapies
The NCCIH1 has reclassified 
complementary health approaches 
into 2 broad categories: natural 
products or mind and body practices. 
According to the NCCIH, 
1 examples 
of mind-body therapies include, 
but are not limited to, mindfulness, 
meditation, yoga, tai chi, hypnosis, 
biofeedback, guided imagery, and 
journal writing. In a review of the 
overarching use of mind-body 
therapies in children, researchers 
found a low prevalence of adverse 
effects and good acceptance of these 
noninvasive therapies, even in 
children of preschool age, for several 
modalities, such as progressive 
muscle relaxation, music therapy, and 
guided imagery.141
Evidence for the use of selected 
mind-body therapies in children 
has recently been published in the 
first AAP Clinical Report on mind-
body therapy use in children.142 The 
following therapies were reviewed: 
biofeedback, clinical hypnosis, 
guided imagery, yoga, meditation, 
and mindfulness-based stress 
reduction. The range of therapies 
were successfully applied in a broad 
range of conditions, including chronic 
pain, migraine headache, tension 
headache, functional disorders of 
elimination, procedural anxiety, 
depression and anxiety, coping and 
self-regulatory skills, and sleep 
disorders, among other conditions.1 
In emerging literature, benefits 
of school-based mindfulness in 
coping and self-regulation as well as 
reduction in psychological symptoms 
have been demonstrated.143 
– 
146
Yoga
Yoga has its historical origins in 
ancient Indian philosophy and has 
become a popular form of exercise 
and movement practice in Western 
nations. According to the 2012 NHIS, 
for children 4 to 17 years of age, 
there was a statistically significant 
increase in the use of any yoga, 
tai chi, or qigong between 2007 
(2.5%) and 2012 (3.2%). Most of 
this increase can be attributed to the 
increased use of yoga (2.3%–3.1%), 
reflecting an estimated 429 000 more 
children using yoga in 2012 than in 
2007.12
In a systematic review of yoga in 
children, Rosen et al147 showed 
that yoga has a positive effect 
on psychological functioning, 
particularly to address emotional, 
behavioral, and mental problems in 
children, and proposed that schools 
may be an ideal place to introduce 
yoga programs. Yoga was found to 
be especially beneficial in children 
with asthma, IBS, juvenile idiopathic 
arthritis, and fibromyalgia in the 
review.147 Authors of a systematic 
review of literature and a meta-
analysis on yoga in the treatment 
of ADHD including 8 RCTs (n = 
249 patients) suggested that yoga 
improves the core symptoms 
of ADHD.148 Yoga has also been 
suggested to improve symptoms of 
IBS in adolescents149 and asthma150 
and has been shown to help in stress 
reduction in children.151
Prenatal yoga has also been shown 
to reduce maternal anxiety and 
depression, according to a systematic 
review, 
152 and to improve birth 
weight, decrease preterm labor, 
and reduce the risk of intrauterine 
growth restriction.153, 
 
154 More 
systematic studies are needed on the 
effects of prenatal yoga and yoga in 
other health conditions in children.
Spirituality
Spiritual healing includes prayer 
and has traditionally been identified 
as one of the most prevalent 
complementary therapies in the 
United States.155 Eighty-two percent 
of Americans believe in the healing 
power of personal prayer, 73% 
believe that praying for someone 
else can help cure their illness, and 
77% believe that God sometimes 
intervenes to cure people who 
have a serious illness.156 Prayer is 
used by up to two-thirds of parents 
for their children.157, 
 
158 Studies 
have suggested that spiritual and/
or religious beliefs and practices 
may contribute to decreased stress 
and increased sense of well-being 
and enhanced immune system 
functioning.157 In a large systematic 
literature review, Best et al159 
demonstrated that the majority 
of patients express interest in a 
discussion of religion and spirituality 
in the medical visit. Spirituality in 
health care is especially relevant to 
children in oncology and palliative 
care settings, in which skillful 
intervention can be of benefit to both 
child and family.160
RCTs of the clinical therapeutic 
effects of prayer in pediatrics are 
lacking, although work is active on 
a national level to introduce more 
structure into the use of spirituality 
in health care via the FICA Spiritual 
History tool for use in the clinical 
setting. Categories covered include 
Faith and belief, Importance, 
Community, and Address in care.161 
Some states have pursued legal 
measures against parents seeking 
prayer or spiritual healing as an 
alternative to conventional medical 
therapy for children with serious 
medical problems, such as cancer. 
The AAP report of the Task Force 
on the Family recommends that, 
although the religious beliefs of

 the family must be respected, 
parents must be held accountable 
for withholding medical care when 
doing so would likely result in 
death or suffering.162 The majority 
of families surveyed viewed 
spiritual healing as a personal 
practice that is complementary 
to medical care rather than a 
replacement for it.156
Mind-body medicine is a rapidly 
growing area of research in children 
that shows low risk of adverse 
events. The 2016 AAP Clinical 
Report on the use of mind-body 
therapies in children provides a 
detailed overview of the current 
research in this area.142 Potential 
concerns associated with the use of 
mind-body therapies may include 
delays in diagnosis or treatment of 
serious illness or use in a child with 
a history of trauma or who suffers 
posttraumatic stress disorder. 
Open discussion of all therapeutic 
approaches is important so that 
parents feel safe and supported 
in bringing their questions on the 
use of complementary therapies 
to conventionally trained health 
care providers. Additional studies 
are needed to evaluate safety 
and effectiveness of individual 
and combination mind and body 
therapies for specific medical 
conditions and overall well-being.
Biofield Therapies
Biofield therapies encompass 
several healing practices that 
include therapeutic touch, healing 
touch, and spiritual healing, among 
others.163 The biofield therapies are 
“intended to affect energy fields that 
purportedly surround and penetrate 
the human body” and are “rooted 
in concepts of compassion, positive 
intention, self-empowerment, the 
mind-body-spirit triad, and the 
body’s innate tendency toward 
healing.” 
164 Therapeutic touch 
and healing touch have been used 
successfully in pediatric oncology 
patients as a nonpharmacologic 
approach to reduction of pain and 
stress.165 
–167
Acupuncture
Acupuncture is an integral 
component of TCM, which has been 
practiced for thousands of years. 
The use of acupuncture is thought 
to address blockages, excess, or 
deficiency of “Qi, 
” defined in TCM as 
the circulating life force that flows 
through the body in meridians.167 
Acupuncture is performed using 
solid-core, small-gauge sterile 
needles to penetrate the skin, which 
are then commonly stimulated 
manually. Acupuncture points can 
also be stimulated by massage 
or pressure in a therapy called 
acupressure. Some children and 
adolescents may be more willing to 
try acupressure than acupuncture, 
especially patients with a fear of 
needles.168
The use of acupuncture is widespread 
in the United States, with increasing 
numbers of Americans having 
been shown to seek acupuncture 
treatments each year.18 Researchers 
conducting the 2007 NHIS estimated 
that 150 000 children had received 
acupuncture treatment in the 
preceding year.39
In a 2011 systematic review of 
reported adverse events associated 
with pediatric acupuncture, Adams 
et al55 concluded that acupuncture 
is generally safe in the pediatric 
population when practiced by an 
appropriately trained practitioner. 
The body of literature on the efficacy 
of acupuncture in specific conditions 
is accruing, although interpretation 
is hampered by study size and 
design variability. In a review of 24 
systematic reviews involving 142 
RCTs and >12 000 children, Yang  
et al169 showed there is promise 
for the use of acupuncture in 
pediatric pain, nocturnal enuresis, 
tic disorders, amblyopia, and 
cerebral palsy, with few adverse 
events reported. In a review of the 
literature in a 2016 paper, Brittner 
et al170 reflected a similar variability 
in study design and quality, with 
the strongest evidence seen in the 
treatment of pediatric headache 
and migraine and in treatment of 
postoperative pain.
whole and Traditional medical 
systems
Whole medical systems involve 
complete systems of theory, 
diagnosis, and practice that have 
evolved independently from or 
parallel to conventional Western 
medicine.1 The most commonly 
recognized whole medical systems 
include TCM, Ayurvedic medicine 
(India’s traditional system of 
medicine), and naturopathy.171 
Each generally relies on the use of 
a detailed diagnostic process and 
uses highly individualized treatment 
protocols that may involve diet 
and exercise, along with herbal 
treatment, making them more 
challenging to evaluate, especially in 
pediatrics.
TCm
TCM is a complete medical system 
that includes a variety of practices 
such as acupuncture, herbal 
medicine, moxibustion (burning an 
herb above the skin to apply heat to 
acupuncture points), tui na (Chinese 
therapeutic massage), acupressure, 
cupping, dietary therapy, and tai 
chi and qigong (see Mind-Body 
Therapies).172 Herbal medicines 
used in TCM can have powerful 
therapeutic but also toxic effects on 
the body’s biochemistry and may 
also affect the metabolism of other 
drugs.173, 
 
174
Ayurveda
Ayurvedic medicine is one of the 
oldest whole medical systems in 
the world and is widely used in 
India and South Asia.175 The word 
Ayurveda means “the knowledge of 
life” and comes from the Sanskrit 
words “ayur” (life) and “veda” 
(science, knowledge). Ayurvedic

 medicine concepts include universal 
interconnectedness (people, health, 
universe), the body’s constitution 
(prakriti), and life forces (dosha). 
Ayurvedic physicians prescribe 
individualized treatments, including 
diet, herbs, spices, exercise, and 
lifestyle.176 Similar to herbs used in 
TCM, Ayurvedic herbal medicines 
can have both powerful therapeutic 
and toxic effects and may expose 
patients to heavy metals, especially 
lead, mercury, and arsenic.168, 
 
177– 
179 
Ayurvedic approaches have been 
studied in children for treatment 
of certain conditions (for example, 
iron-deficiency anemia).168 Curcumin 
is valued in Ayurvedic medicine 
for its antiinflammatory properties 
and has been evaluated for safety 
and tolerability in children with 
IBS. Further studies on its specific 
clinical application and dosing in 
pediatric conditions are needed.180 A 
2012 Cochrane Systematic Database 
review commented that curcumin 
may be safe and effective as an 
adjunct treatment in the maintenance 
of remission in ulcerative colitis.180 
Further studies are needed to 
determine the efficacy and safety of 
Ayurvedic treatment modalities in 
pediatrics.
naturopathy
Naturopathy is guided by a 
philosophy that emphasizes 
the healing power of nature. 
Naturopaths use both traditional 
and modern therapies (approaches 
they consider to be the most 
natural and least invasive) and 
view their role as supporting the 
body’s inherent ability to maintain 
and restore health.172, 
 
181 There is 
currently little evidence on the use 
of naturopathy in medical conditions 
in children.
InsURAnCE COvERAgE
The Patient Protection and 
Affordable Care Act182 was signed 
into law in 2010 and ensured 
coverage for essential health 
benefits. The initial list of 10 
essential health benefits included 
ambulatory care, emergency 
services, hospitalizations, laboratory 
services, maternity and newborn 
care, mental health and addiction 
treatment, rehabilitation services, 
pediatric care, prescriptions, and 
preventive, wellness, and chronic 
disease treatment. Although the 
Patient Protection and Affordable 
Care Act promotes wellness, 
the effect on compensation for 
integrative medicine services is 
still unclear. States have discretion 
regarding which services are 
considered part of the essential 
health benefits. For example, some 
states include acupuncture as an 
essential health benefit (at the time 
of writing, this includes California, 
Florida, Minnesota, New Mexico, 
and Oregon). Many states include 
chiropractic as an essential benefit, 
typically under rehabilitation 
services. Section 2706a of the Public 
Health Service Act states that an 
insurer “shall not discriminate 
with respect to participation under 
the plan or coverage against any 
health care provider who is acting 
within the scope of that provider’s 
license or certification under 
applicable State law.” The type of 
health care provider is not specified 
and, therefore, is open to a level of 
interpretation. An ongoing obstacle 
for health insurance companies 
is a lack of standardization in 
credentialing and coding of 
complementary medicine services, 
compounded by the sparse number 
of Current Procedural Terminology 
codes that adequately cover these 
services.183
COnClUsIOns AnD 
RECOmmEnDATIOns
Pediatricians and other primary 
care providers who care for 
children are encouraged to advise 
and counsel patients and families 
about relevant, safe, effective, and 
age-appropriate health services and 
therapies, regardless of whether 
they are considered conventional 
or complementary therapies. In 
the 2001 AAP Periodic Survey of 
Fellows, 73% of pediatricians agreed 
that it is the role of pediatricians 
to provide patients and/or families 
with information about all potential 
treatment options for the patient’s 
condition, and 54% agreed that 
pediatricians should consider the 
use of all potential therapies, not 
just those of mainstream medicine, 
when treating patients. Because 
most families use complementary 
and integrative health services 
without spontaneously reporting this 
use to their primary care provider, 
pediatricians can best provide 
appropriate advice and counseling if 
they regularly inquire about all the 
therapies the family is using to help 
the child.
Pediatricians should seek continued 
and updated knowledge about 
therapeutic options available to 
their patients (whether they are 
mainstream or complementary) 
and about the specific services 
used by individual patients to 
promote discussion about the safety, 
appropriateness, and advisability 
of complementary therapies. Only 
then can pediatricians appreciate 
the concerns of their patients 
and families and offer them the 
thoughtful and knowledgeable 
guidance they may require. Given 
accruing supporting evidence and the 
potential of integrative approaches to 
improve preventive care in children, 
policy and health insurance coverage 
should evolve accordingly to provide 
fair coverage for patients and 
equitable payment for physicians.

 help health care providers feel 
“ARMED” to address the topic of 
complementary approaches with 
more confidence and ease.
 
• A: Ask about the different therapies 
used by patients. Patients and 
parents often do not disclose 
use of complementary therapies 
because many of them believe 
that it is not relevant or not within 
the primary care provider’s 
interest or expertise.185, 
 
186 By 
asking routinely, pediatricians can 
learn whether a child is receiving 
complementary therapies. This 
knowledge is essential for the 
pediatrician to evaluate and 
counsel about potential adverse 
effects and to enhance the 
probability of correctly attributing 
improvements or adverse effects to 
the specific intervention. Questions 
that include examples are often 
helpful in jogging memories and 
enhancing disclosure. Rather than 
asking whether a patient is using 
any alternative therapies, the 
pediatrician might ask whether 
the patient is using any “vitamins, 
herbs, supplements, teas, home 
remedies, back rubs, chiropractic, 
acupuncture, or other services to 
enhance health.” It is also often 
useful to ask how the patient 
manages stress; examples here 
may include exercise, prayer, 
music, or talking with friends or 
trusted adults;
 
• R: Respect the family’s perspectives, 
values, and cultural beliefs in open, 
ongoing communication centered 
on the patient’s well-being. 
Recognize cultural or educational 
differences. Demonstrate respect 
for families and their values. 
Work together with the parents 
as a team to consider and evaluate 
all appropriate treatments. 
A discussion of an array of 
conventional and complementary 
treatment options may be required. 
By actively listening to families and 
patients, pediatricians can become 
important allies in examining all 
potential treatment options for 
children. Maintaining a dialogue to 
promote the best interests of the 
child is critical to the integrity of the 
medical home;
 
• M: Monitor the patient’s response 
to treatment and establish 
measurable outcomes for 
evaluation. Measurable outcomes, 
such as specific goals for symptom 
relief, can be established. The 
concept of primum non nocere 
(“first do no harm”) is central to 
all clinical practice. If there is a 
lack of response or an untoward 
response, the therapy needs to be 
reevaluated;
 
• E: Educate yourself and the patient 
and/or family by identifying 
credible, evidence-based resources 
on complementary therapies. 
Complementary medicine is an 
evolving field, and maintaining 
current knowledge of popular 
complementary therapies is 
important in evaluating safety and 
effectiveness of integrative health 
approaches. Become familiar with 
the definitions, terms, and uses of 
complementary practices and learn 
about specific complementary 
therapies patients are using in 
your community. Identify the 
most common modalities and 
professionals that are available in 
your pediatric practice area; and
 
• D: Distribute evidence-based 
information about relevant 
therapies available from the 
NCCIH, the ACIMH member 
institutions, and an increasing 
number of publications in peer-
reviewed journals and professional 
review articles.
