Measuring progress from 1990 to 2017 and projecting 
attainment to 2030 of the health-related Sustainable 
Development Goals for 195 countries and territories: 
a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease 
Study 2017
GBD 2017 SDG Collaborators*
Summary
Background Efforts to establish the 2015 baseline and monitor early implementation of the UN Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs) highlight both great potential for and threats to improving health by 2030. To fully 
deliver on the SDG aim of “leaving no one behind”, it is increasingly important to examine the health-related SDGs 
beyond national-level estimates. As part of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2017 
(GBD 2017), we measured progress on 41 of 52 health-related SDG indicators and estimated the health-related SDG 
index for 195 countries and territories for the period 1990–2017, projected indicators to 2030, and analysed global 
attainment.
Methods We measured progress on 41 health-related SDG indicators from 1990 to 2017, an increase of four 
indicators since GBD 2016 (new indicators were health worker density, sexual violence by non-intimate partners, 
population census status, and prevalence of physical and sexual violence [reported separately]). We also improved 
the measurement of several previously reported indicators. We constructed national-level estimates and, for a 
subset of health-related SDGs, examined indicator-level differences by sex and Socio-demographic Index (SDI) 
quintile. We also did subnational assessments of performance for selected countries. To construct the health-
related SDG index, we transformed the value for each indicator on a scale of 0–100, with 0 as the 2·5th percentile 
and 100 as the 97·5th percentile of 1000 draws calculated from 1990 to 2030, and took the geometric mean of the 
scaled indicators by target. To generate projections through 2030, we used a forecasting framework that drew 
estimates from the broader GBD study and used weighted averages of indicator-specific and country-specific 
annualised rates of change from 1990 to 2017 to inform future estimates. We assessed attainment of indicators 
with defined targets in two ways: first, using mean values projected for 2030, and then using the probability of 
attainment in 2030 calculated from 1000 draws. We also did a global attainment analysis of the feasibility of 
attaining SDG targets on the basis of past trends. Using 2015 global averages of indicators with defined SDG 
targets, we calculated the global annualised rates of change required from 2015 to 2030 to meet these targets, and 
then identified in what percentiles the required global annualised rates of change fell in the distribution of 
country-level rates of change from 1990 to 2015. We took the mean of these global percentile values across 
indicators and applied the past rate of change at this mean global percentile to all health-related SDG indicators, 
irrespective of target definition, to estimate the equivalent 2030 global average value and percentage change from 
2015 to 2030 for each indicator.
Findings The global median health-related SDG index in 2017 was 59·4 (IQR 35·4–67·3), ranging from a low of 11·6 
(95% uncertainty interval 9·6–14·0) to a high of 84·9 (83·1–86·7). SDG index values in countries assessed at the 
subnational level varied substantially, particularly in China and India, although scores in Japan and the UK were 
more homogeneous. Indicators also varied by SDI quintile and sex, with males having worse outcomes than females 
for non-communicable disease (NCD) mortality, alcohol use, and smoking, among others. Most countries were 
projected to have a higher health-related SDG index in 2030 than in 2017, while country-level probabilities of 
attainment by 2030 varied widely by indicator. Under-5 mortality, neonatal mortality, maternal mortality ratio, and 
malaria indicators had the most countries with at least 95% probability of target attainment. Other indicators, 
including NCD mortality and suicide mortality, had no countries projected to meet corresponding SDG targets on the 
basis of projected mean values for 2030 but showed some probability of attainment by 2030. For some indicators, 
including child malnutrition, several infectious diseases, and most violence measures, the annualised rates of change 
required to meet SDG targets far exceeded the pace of progress achieved by any country in the recent past. We found 
that applying the mean global annualised rate of change to indicators without defined targets would equate to about 
19% and 22% reductions in global smoking and alcohol consumption, respectively; a 47% decline in adolescent birth 
rates; and a more than 85% increase in health worker density per 1000 population by 2030.

Interpretation The GBD study offers a unique, robust platform for monitoring the health-related SDGs across 
demographic and geographic dimensions. Our findings underscore the importance of increased collection and 
analysis of disaggregated data and highlight where more deliberate design or targeting of interventions could 
accelerate progress in attaining the SDGs. Current projections show that many health-related SDG indicators, 
NCDs, NCD-related risks, and violence-related indicators will require a concerted shift away from what might have 
driven past gains—curative interventions in the case of NCDs—towards multisectoral, prevention-oriented policy 
action and investments to achieve SDG aims. Notably, several targets, if they are to be met by 2030, demand a pace 
of progress that no country has achieved in the recent past. The future is fundamentally uncertain, and no model 
can fully predict what breakthroughs or events might alter the course of the SDGs. What is clear is that our 
actions—or inaction—today will ultimately dictate how close the world, collectively, can get to leaving no one 
behind by 2030.

Research in context
Evidence before this study
Measuring country progress on the UN’s Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs) has been an important 
international priority since the SDGs were introduced in 2015. 
The UN, the Sustainable Development Solutions Network, 
WHO, and the World Bank also report on the SDGs, but their 
analyses do not consistently measure indicators for each 
location and year. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and 
Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2015 estimated 33 health-related 
SDG indicators and the overall health-related SDG index from 
1990 to 2015 for 188 countries. In GBD 2016, the number of 
indicators included was expanded to 37, and projections of 
health-related SDG achievement in 2030 were estimated for 
the first time. The ability of decision makers, particularly at the 
national level, to adequately monitor progress on the 
health-related SDGs and budget and plan for the future 
is potentially hampered by the scarcity of disaggregated data, 
such as by subnational unit, sex, and socioeconomic level. 
Complete estimates of SDG progress at these levels are needed 
to identify, and target programmes to, the populations that 
are most at risk of falling behind.
Added value of this study
GBD 2017 provides consistent, comparably generated 
estimates of the health-related SDG indicators for 
195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2017. Additionally, 
GBD 2017 provides, for the first time, estimates of 
health-related SDGs at the subnational level for select 
countries and by sex. Newly estimated indicators in GBD 2017 
include health worker density per 1000 population 
(SDG indicator 3.c.1), sexual violence by non-intimate 
partners (SDG indicator 5.2.2), and population census status 
(SDG indicator 17.19.2a), as well as disaggregation of SDG 
indicator 16.1.3 into prevalence of physical violence (SDG 
indicator 16.1.3a) and sexual violence (SDG indicator 16.1.3c) 
following the March, 2018, refinements accepted by the UN 
Statistical Commission. Measurement improvements 
included reporting on prevalence of current smoking rather 
than of daily smoking to better align with the UN’s definition 
and internally consistent, systematic estimation of 
adolescent birth rates within the broader GBD study. We used 
a forecasting platform that systematically captures the effects 
of independent drivers of population health into the future to 
generate projections through 2030. On the basis of past 
trends, we assessed country-level probabilities of attainment 
for SDG indicators with defined targets. We also calculated 
the rates of change required to meet defined SDG targets at 
the global level from 2015 to 2030, and then compared them 
to annualised rates of change observed at the country level 
from 1990 to 2015; this analysis provided a way of 
benchmarking the pace of progress needed to meet 
ambitious SDG aims with what the world has achieved in the 
past. We then applied the mean percentile of the global 
required rates of change to all SDG indicators, providing a 
historically grounded foundation to evaluate progress for 
indicators without explicit targets and the relative feasibility 
of current ones.
Implications of all the available evidence
Most countries were projected to improve their health-related 
SDG index scores by 2030, although our results revealed gaps 
in potential progress at and beyond the national level. This 
information is urgently needed to inform strategies for 
attaining SDG targets, which for many countries will require 
rates of progress that are faster than rates achieved in the 
recent past. Most countries already have national action plans 
in place for, and are in a better position to meet indicator 
targets that have origins in, the Millennium Development 
Goals, whereas the SDGs have not been similarly 
operationalised in many national policies. In the remaining 
years of the SDG era, it is crucial that governments and 
international institutions invest in and implement 
SDG-related programmes and continue to monitor 
inequalities in the health-related SDGs within populations to 
truly deliver on the promise of leaving no one behind.

Introduction
During the early years of implementation of the UN’s 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which were 
adopted in 2015,1 various international efforts have 
sought to galvanise faster progress towards the 
SDGs’ bold aims. A recent example includes WHO’s 
13th General Programme of Work (GPW13) for 2019–23,2 
which involves an ambitious agenda of measurable goals 
and interconnected strategies to ensure healthy lives and 
wellbeing for people of all ages. The GPW13 has three 
strategic priorities that will be measured by existing, or 
composites of existing, SDG indicators: achieving 
universal health coverage (UHC), addressing health 
emergencies, and promoting healthier populations.3
We are in the third year of the SDG era, and progress 
towards the world-changing aspirations of the SDGs 
remains a gradual, ongoing process. Although, for 
some indicators, many countries have maintained the 
pace of progress made during the era of the Millennium 
Development Goals, for other indicators, countries 
have seen gains slow.4–7 These trends under 
score the 
need to focus existing programmes and policies on the 
expanded scope of the SDG agenda. For instance, some 
countries in sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America will 
need to hasten progress against non-communicable 
diseases (NCDs) if corresponding SDG targets are to be 
met, and NCDs are a major component of the GPW13.8,9 
Although NCD prevention is a UN policy priority,10 
and many evidence-based policies and programmes 
exist to target NCDs, substantial implementation gaps 
remain. The Lancet has called for 2018 to be the year 
for action against NCDs,9,11,12 and in the report Time 
to Deliver,5,6 the WHO Independent High-Level Com-
mission on Noncommunicable Diseases declared there 
is no excuse not to act.
The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk 
Factors Study (GBD) 2015 was the first GBD effort to 
measure the health-related SDGs, producing estimates 
for 33 health-related SDG indicators and generating an 
overall measure, the health-related SDG index, from 
1990 to 2015 for 188 countries.13 For GBD 2016, this effort 
was expanded to include four additional SDG indicators, 
as well as projections of SDG attainment through 
2030 based on past trends.5 GBD 2016 also improved 
methods for measuring UHC service coverage.5 Other 
organisations measure a subset of the health-related 
SDG indicators, but not consistently across locations and 
years.4,6,7
Although national SDG analyses can be useful for 
guiding health policy, the most vulnerable populations 
within countries are still at risk of being left behind. 
Country-level measures of population health likely 
mask disparities between and within subnational ad-
mini 
s 
t 
rative divisions, particularly in low-income and 
middle-income countries.14–18 National governments need 
subnational data to inform the localisation of global SDG 
policies and programmes, allowing decision makers to 
better target resource allocation and service delivery.19,20 
In many places, males and females also experience 
disparate risk exposures and corresponding health 
outcomes,21 yet SDG reports do not typically provide 
data disaggregated by sex, with the exception of those 
on smoking prevalence. The Inter-agency and Expert 
Group on Sustainable Development Goal Indicators has 
requested that metadata be disaggregated by sex for 
19 health-related SDG indicators,22 and more detailed 
data will need to be collected and monitored to assess 
progress, identify high-risk populations, and develop 
targeted approaches to prevention and treatment. 
Although valuable, even data at this level might not be 
sufficient to capture inequalities underlying macro-level 
trends. Finally, in the absence of clearly defined targets, 
progress on several health-related SDG indicators cannot 
be benchmarked against SDG aims. Target setting is a 
complex process that requires a delicate balance of 
technical and political inputs; yet, without established 
targets, galvanising greater political and financial 
commitments to address health needs during the SDG 
era could be challenging.
In this study, we provide updated estimates for 41 of 
52 health-related SDG indicators and the overall health-
related SDG index for 195 countries and territories. For 
ten indicators, we compare progress from 1990 to 2017 by 
sex and by Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a composite 
measure of overall development. Using past trends, we 
project global progress and analyse attainment of the 
health-related SDGs through 2030. These estimates will 
provide a benchmark against which the feasibility of 
attaining SDG targets by 2030 can be assessed on the 
basis of what countries have achieved in the past. 
Compared with GBD 2016, GBD 2017 includes four 
additional health-related SDG indicators and improves 
the measurement of some previously included indicators. 
This analysis can support global efforts, such as the 
monitoring of the GPW13, and national-level decision 
making by inter 
national institutions, policy makers, and 
national governments who implement the health-related 
SDGs.
Methods
Overview of GBD
Each year, the GBD study produces age-specific, sex-
specific, and location-specific estimates of all-cause and 
cause-specific mortality, non-fatal outcomes, overall 
disease burden (ie, disability-adjusted life-years), and risk 
factor exposure and attributable burden from 1990 to the 
current study year.
This analysis of the health-related SDGs is based on 
GBD 2017 estimates. Broader GBD 2017 methods are 
described elsewhere,21,23–27 while further detail on data 
sources and estimation approaches used for this analysis 
are available in appendix 1 (part 1). We used previously 
established GBD methods to generate indicator-specific 
estimates for 1990–2017, including the Cause of Death

Ensemble model for causes of death,23,28 DisMod-MR for 
many non-fatal causes,26,29 and spatiotemporal Gaussian 
process regression for most risk factor exposures, 
measures of intervention coverage, and other SDG 
indicators (eg, well-certified death registration [SDG 
indicator 17
.19.2c]).21,30
Each year, GBD includes sub 
national analyses for a few 
new countries and continues to provide subnational 
estimates for countries that were added in previous 
cycles. Subnational estimation in GBD 2017 includes five 
new countries (Ethiopia, Iran, New Zealand, Norway, 
Russia) and countries previously estimated at subnational 
levels (GBD 2013: China, Mexico, and the UK [regional 
level]; GBD 2015: Brazil, India, Japan, Kenya, South 
Africa, Sweden, and the USA; GBD 2016: Indonesia and 
the UK [local government authority level]). All analyses 
are at the first level of administrative organisation within 
each country except for New Zealand (by Māori ethnicity), 
Sweden (by Stockholm and non-Stockholm), and the UK 
(by local government authorities). All subnational 
estimates for these countries were incorporated into 
model development and evaluation as part of GBD 2017
. 
To meet data use requirements, in this publication we 
present all subnational estimates excluding those 
pending publication (Brazil, India, Japan, Kenya, Mexico, 
Sweden, the UK, and the USA); these results are 
presented in appendix tables and figures (appendix 2). 
Subnational estimates for countries with populations 
larger than 200 million (as measured with our most 
recent year of published estimates) that have not yet been 
published elsewhere are presented wherever estimates 
are illustrated with maps, but are not included in data 
tables.
The GBD study uses standardised and replicable 
methods that comply with the Guidelines for Accurate 
and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting (GATHER).31 
Analyses were done with R version 3.4.4, Python 
version 2.7
.14, or Stata version 13.1. The entire GBD time 
series is updated annually with improved methods and 
data sources, and thus GBD 2017 findings, including the 
SDG analysis presented here, supersede all previous 
GBD publications.
Indicators, definitions, and measurement approaches
The health-related SDG indicators are shown in table 1. 
GBD 2017 assesses four more indicators than assessed in 
GBD 2016. The first is health worker density (SDG 
indicator 3.c.1), which is defined by the UN as health 
workers per 1000 population, by cadre of health worker. 
For this analysis, we report estimates for three main 
groups of health workers: physicians, nurses and 
midwives, and pharmacists. We used International 
Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO) 88 to map 
cadres of health workers from multiple data sources and 
coding systems, resulting in comparable and consistently 
defined groupings of health workers over time and across 
locations (appendix 1 part 1). 
The second new indicator is sexual violence by non-
intimate partners (SDG indicator 5.2.2), which is defined 
as the prevalence of females aged 15 years and older who 
have been subjected to sexual violence by non-intimate 
partners in the past 12 months. The third is the separate 
reporting of the prevalence of physical and sexual 
violence (SDG indicator 16.1.3). In March, 2018, the UN 
Statistical Commission approved refinements to SDG 
indicator 16.1.3, such that the indicator is now defined as 
the “proportion of population subjected to (a) physical 
violence, (b) psycho 
logical violence, and (c) sexual 
violence in the previous 12 months”.32,33 Following the 
GBD precedent of measuring each component of an 
SDG indicator (eg, reporting separately on child wasting 
and overweight [SDG indicators 2.2.2a and 2.2.2b] and 
on sanitation and access to handwashing facilities [SDG 
indicators 6.2.1a and 6.2.1b]),5,13 we report the prevalence 
of physical violence and that of sexual violence separately. 
Owing to measurement challenges and data sparsity, we 
did not measure the prevalence of psychological violence.
The final new indicator is population census status 
(SDG indicator 17
.19.2a), which was defined as covered if 
a location had conducted a population and housing 
census within the past 10 years or had an established 
population registry that routinely captured nationally 
representative demographic infor 
mation (appendix 1 
part 1). To assess population census status, we used data 
compiled for GBD 2017 population estimates,24 as well as 
all available data on population census implementation 
since 1980 and documentation of population registries.
As well as adding new indicators, we have improved the 
measurement of several previously reported indicators. 
For smoking prevalence (SDG indicator 3.a.1), we now 
report prevalence of current smoking (daily and occasional 
smokers) rather than only daily smoking to better align 
with the UN’s definition (appendix 1 part 1). For vaccine 
coverage (SDG indicator 3.b.1), we include all eight 
vaccines in the aggregate measure for each location-year, 
rather than limiting the aggregate to vaccines expressly 
included in national vaccine schedules. Additionally, we 
now take the arithmetic, rather than the geometric, mean 
across the eight vaccines. These revisions allow better 
comparability across locations over time, avoid inadvert-
ently penalising countries for introducing and scaling up 
new vaccines, and provide a better reflection of overall 
vaccine coverage for target populations.
The UHC service coverage index includes nine 
measures of coverage for a subset of interventions for 
communicable diseases and maternal and child health 
and the 32 causes that comprise the Healthcare Access 
and Quality (HAQ) Index (appendix 1 part 1). The HAQ 
Index is an overall measure of health-care access 
and quality based on risk-standardised death rates or 
mortality-to-incidence ratios from causes amenable to 
health care.34 Following updated HAQ methods,34 
we used mortality-to-incidence ratios for cancers 
rather than risk-standardised death rates for the UHC

does not capture the distribution of use. The SEV for alcohol use 
is based on two primary dimensions: individual-level drinking 
(current drinkers and lifetime abstainers, and alcohol 
consumption by age and sex) and population-level consumption 
(litre per capita of pure alcohol stock). The SEV then weights 
these categories with their corresponding relative risks, which 
translates to a risk-weighted prevalence on a scale of 0% (no risk 
in the population) to 100% (the entire population experiences 
maximum risk associated with alcohol consumption)

Target 3.b: Support the research

medicines for communicable and 
NCDs that primarily affect 
developing countries; provide 
access to affordable essential 
medicines and vaccines, in 
accordance with the Doha 
Declaration on the TRIPS 
Agreement and Public Health, 
which affirms the right of 
developing countries to use to the 
full the provisions in the 
Agreement on Trade-Related 
Aspects of Intellectual Property 
Rights regarding flexibilities to 
protect public health, and, in 
particular, provide access to

Vaccine 
coverage 
(3.b.1)
Coverage of eight vaccines in 
target populations, %
Yes
Vaccines included DPT3, both doses of measles vaccine 
(one dose and two doses, reported separately), polio 
(three doses), hepatitis B (three doses), Haemophilus influenzae 
type b (three doses), pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (three 
doses), and rotavirus vaccine (two or three doses). We then used 
the arithmetic mean of coverage of these eight vaccines to 
calculate overall vaccine coverage of target populations. For GBD 
2017, we made some methodological updates for this measure. 
We now assess coverage for all eight vaccines for every 
location-year rather than limiting the aggregate to vaccines 
expressly included in national vaccine schedules. This revision 
allows for greater comparability across locations over time and 
helps to avoid overly penalising countries for introducing and 
scaling up new vaccines. As a result, we were able to remove the 
3 year lag that had previously been used for new vaccine 
introduction; its original utility was to provide a window in 
which coverage could be scaled up before it counted towards 
the aggregate. By replacing all location-year estimates with 
0% coverage before a given vaccine’s introduction, any amount 
of scale-up now contributes to improved overall coverage for 
this indicator. We also now take the arithmetic mean across the 
eight vaccines rather than the geometric mean to avoid over 
sensitivity to the 0% estimates for vaccines that have yet to be 
introduced in a given location-year and to provide a more easily 
interpretable measure of overall vaccine coverage

Development assistance for health is currently assessed within

2017; however, funding specifically for medical research 
(eg, research and development of vaccines and medicines, as 
described in Target 3.b) is not systematically available across 
source and recipient countries. Additionally, the appropriate 
assessment of country-level performance remains unclear 
(eg, whether countries that receive high levels of 
developmental assistance for medical research are equivalent, 
in terms of indicator performance, to countries that disburse 
high levels of developmental assistance for medical research)

Essential

Proportion of health facilities

Across all locations and over time, comparable data on the 
stocking and stock-out rates of essential medicines for all types 
of facility (hospitals, primary care facilities, pharmacies, and 
other health-care outlets) and facility ownership 
(public, private, and informal) are not currently available. In the 
absence of robust measures of stock-outs in both the public 
and private sectors across countries and over time, the 
measurement strategy for producing comparable results for 
this indicator is unclear. Furthermore, what should constitute a 
core set of relevant essential medicines is likely to vary by 
location based on its epidemiological profile, and thus work is 
needed to more precisely define what these core sets of 
relevant essential medicines should be given known disease 
burden, risk factor profiles, and health risks across countries. 
Lastly, the proposed indicator stipulates measurement of not 
simply access to a core set of essential medicines but also access 
to affordable medicines. No comprehensive and comparable 
datasets on the status of essential medicine affordability, in 
addition to their stocks, presently exist

IHR capacity 
(3.d.1)
The WHO-recommended 
measure of IHR capacity and 
health emergency preparedness 
is the percentage of 13 core 
capacities that have been 
attained at a specific time 
(IHR core capacity index). 
The 13 core capacities are: 
national legislation, policy, 
and financing; coordination 
and national focal point 
communications; surveillance; 
response; preparedness; risk 
communication; human 
resources; laboratory; points of 
entry; zoonotic events; food 
safety; chemical events; and 
radionuclear emergencies 
No
Comprehensive and comparable data for all components of the 
IHR core capacity index, for all locations and over time, are not 
currently openly available. Self-evaluations have been 
undertaken by some member states, with a subset followed up 
with independent assessments via the Joint External Evaluation 
process. To date, 23 countries have completed this process and 
made reports fully available out of a total of 43 completed Joint 
External Evaluations. An additional 30 countries are scheduled 
for assessment by the end of 2018. As these data become more 
openly available it might be possible to model regional and 
temporal trends to obtain estimates for outstanding countries, 
but this will likely necessitate creating bespoke covariates 
relating to policy status and types of surveillance system that 
are not currently reported in the GBD study

Indicator 16.1.3 involves three separate types of violence 
experienced by populations: physical, psychological, and sexual. 
Current data availability allows for reporting of physical and 
sexual violence as part of the GBD study, whereas substantial 
challenges remain for the measurement of psychological 
violence across locations, by sex, and over time. These include 
issues with self-report and recall periods; non-standard 
classifications and reporting of types of psychological violence; 
and overall minimal data availability on psychological violence, 
particularly among males

cause-specific mortality.36 The modelling framework was 
designed to account for the relationships between risk 
factors and other independent drivers of health outcomes 
(eg, gains in sociodemographic develop 
ment, select 
interventions such as vaccine coverage, and met need for 
family planning), thus better capturing causal pathways 
of health change shown in randomised controlled trials 
and cohort studies.
We generated projections for independent drivers by 
calculating the annual change in each location and year 
from 1990 to 2017 in logit or natural-log space, and then 
computing weighted annualised rates of change. If 
weights were closer to zero, annual rates of change over 
time were more equally weighted across years; if weights 
were closer to higher values, recent years were more 
heavily weighted than were earlier years. These weights 
were selected through out-of-sample predictive validity 
tests; further details on the overarching forecasting 
framework and weight selection are in appendix 1 (part 3). 
Some causes (eg, natural disasters, conflict and terrorism, 
and HIV) required model modi 
fications or alternative 
estimation strategies to account for either their stochastic 
nature or, in the case of HIV, unique sensitivity to 
intervention coverage (see appendix 1 part 3, and 
elsewhere36).
Some indicators were inputs or outputs of the 
forecasting platform; for others, we used the weighted 
annualised rate of change method to produce projections 
to 2030 (appendix 1 part 3). For the UHC service coverage 
index, a modified version of the overarching forecasting

Indicator 17.19.2 involves three separate country-level 
components pertaining to demographic and health data 
collection and monitoring: status of conducting at least 
one population and housing census in the past 10 years, 
birth registration, and death registration. Although these 
data collection and monitoring systems are interconnected, 
their actual status or functionality at a given time can vary. 
Thus, we have separated reporting on 17.19.2 into three 
indicators. For indicator 17.19.2a, census status was ascertained 
according to whether a population and housing census was 
conducted within the past 10 years for a given location-year 
or a population registry had been established. Census 
implementation was cross-checked against the World 
Population and Housing Census Programme online database

components pertaining to demographic and health data 
collection and monitoring: status of conducting at least 
one population and housing census in the past 10 years, birth

collection and monitoring systems are interconnected, their 
actual status or functionality at a given time can vary. Thus, we 
have separated reporting on 17.19.2 into three indicators. 
For indicator 17.19.2c, well-certified deaths were determined by 
three measures: completeness of death registration, fraction of 
deaths not assigned to major garbage codes (ie, causes that 
cannot or should not be underlying causes of death), and 
fraction of deaths assigned to detailed GBD causes

framework was used, modelling the relationship between 
total health spending per capita and the UHC service 
coverage index with stochastic frontier analysis.37 We did 
not generate projections of census coverage because of 
its binary nature and the lack of documentation about 
planned censuses across all countries. Additionally, we 
do not currently project indicators by sex or subnationally.
Health-related SDG index
The health-related SDG index was originally developed 
in GBD 2015.13 The overall index for GBD 2017 consisted 
of 40 health-related SDG indicators (population census 
coverage was not included because of its binary status 
and because it does not have forecasts). To create the 
health-related SDG index, we used a preference-weighted 
approach in which we considered the SDGs as 
representing the expressed preferences of UN member 
states and thus assumed that each SDG target should be 
weighted equally.
Each indicator was scaled to a value from 0 to 100, 
reflecting worst to best performance, to enable optimal 
comparison across diverse indicators, with 0 being the 
2·5th percentile value and 100 being the 97·5th percentile 
value of 1000 observed or projected draws over the period 
1990–2030. This approach reduced sensitivity to extreme 
outliers in given location-years. Negative indicators, for 
which lower values were more desirable than higher 
values (ie, mortality, incidence or prevalence, and risk 
exposure), were assigned 100 for the 2·5th percentile and 
0 for the 97·5th percentile. For mortality and incidence, 
values were scaled in log-space.
We calculated the geometric mean of scaled health-
related SDG indicators by target, and then took the 
geometric mean across all health-related SDG targets to 
produce the overall health-related SDG index. We used 
the geometric mean to allow for partial substitutability 
(ie, permitting high values for some indicators to only 
partially compensate for indicators with very low values). 
We restricted indicators to a minimum value of 1 when 
calculating the overall index to mitigate issues with 
values close to 0. To generate subnational SDG indices, 
we used the national-level 2·5th and 97·5th percentile 
values for each indicator to scale indicators for each 
subnational location. We used the same overall index 
construction methods for national and subnational 
locations.
For health worker density (SDG indicator 3.c.1), we 
used a modified scaling approach to reflect the impor-
tance of each health worker cadre (physicians, nurses 
and midwives, and pharmacists). On the basis of logistic 
regressions between each cadre and the HAQ Index,34 we 
identified the values at which additional increases in 
health worker density resulted in diminishing returns 
on the HAQ Index.34 In per 10 000 population space, 
these threshold values were 30 physicians, 100 nurses 
and midwives, and five pharmacists (appendix 1 part 1). 
Although we used the 2·5th percentile value of 
1000 draws observed or projected from 1990 to 2030 to 
set the 0 threshold for all three cadres of health workers, 
we used cadre-specific thresholds to set the bounds for a 
100 score rather than the 97·5th percentile of 1000 draws. 
We then took the geometric mean of scaled scores across 
the three cadres to estimate overall performance on the 
health worker density indicator.
Country and global SDG indicator attainment
Some health-related SDG indicators have targets 
explicitly defined by UN resolution 71/313,38 including 
absolute targets and targets set in relation to 2015 values, 
whereas some indicators have undefined targets. In this 
analysis, 25 indicators had defined targets, for which we 
applied corresponding thresholds to analyse 2030 
attainment (2020 in the case of road injury mortality, as 
set by the UN). For indicators with targets related to 
universal coverage or access, we set thresholds as 99%, 
whereas for indicators with targets related to achieving 
elimination or ending epidemics, we set thresholds as an 
incidence of 0·5 per 100 000 population or less or a 
prevalence of 0·5% or less. Thresholds or relative 
reductions for each target are shown in table 1.
For GBD 2017, we estimated the probability of each 
country attaining health-related SDG indicators with 
defined targets. We used our indicator projections to 
2030 at the draw level (1000 draws in total), calculating 
at each draw whether or not a country would attain a 
target. The total probability of attainment was the 
number of draws in which the country would attain the 
target divided by the total number of draws. We also 
calculated the mean estimate in 2030 (the average of 
1000 draws), and used that estimate to assess whether or 
not a country would attain a target. Consequently, 
countries could have some probability of attainment for 
given targets despite not having projected attainment at 
the mean level.
We also used past rates of change observed before the 
SDG era (ie, 1990–2015, or the monitoring period of 
the Millennium Development Goals) to analyse the 
feasibility of attaining SDG indicator targets in 2030. 
For SDG indicators with defined targets, we compared 
country-level annualised rates of change for 1990–2015 
(ie, what has been achieved in the past) with the global 
pace of progress required to meet targets during the 
SDG era (2015–30) based on 2015 global estimates 
for each indicator; these estimates were derived from 
population-weighted means. For each indicator, we 
compared the required global annualised rate of change 
for 2015–30 against the distribution of past country-
level annualised rates of change, and calculated in 
which percentile of performance the global required 
annualised rate of change would fall. We took the mean 
of those percentiles across the 25 indicators with defined 
targets and found that, on average, the required global 
annualised rates of change for 2015–30 would be in the 
90th percentile of perfor 
mance compared with the

projected the 2030 value and corresponding percentage 
change from 2015 to 2030 based on these annualised 
rates of change.
Uncertainty analysis
For all indicator estimates, GBD 2017 produced 
1000 draws by location, age, and sex and for all years. 
Draws from the posterior distribution represent 
uncertainty in steps in the estimation process as 
well as in underlying data sources. For each scaled 
SDG indicator and the health-related SDG index, we 
calculated 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) on the basis of 
these 1000 draws using simulation analysis. Further 
information about GBD uncertainty analysis is provided 
in related GBD publications.21,23–27
Role of the funding source
The funder of the study had no role in the study design, 
data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or 
writing of the report. All authors had full access to all the 
data in the study and had final responsibility for the 
decision to submit for publication.
Results
Health-related SDGs in 2017
The global median health-related SDG index was 59·4 
(IQR 35·4–67·3) in 2017, ranging from a low of 
11·6 (95% UI 9·6–14·0) to a high of 84·9 (83·1–86·7; 
figure 1). The overall health-related SDG index masked 
substantial variation across indicators within countries. 
Many countries with low overall index scores performed 
reasonably well on some individual indicators and vice 
versa. For example, although Kenya scored only 31·7 
(30·6–32·9) on the overall health-related SDG index for 
2017, the country scored much better on met need for 
family planning (77·8, 74·6–80·9) and smoking 
prevalence (85·4, 82·6–88·0). By contrast, South Korea, 
which scored 72·2 (69·0–74·4) on the overall index, 
scored comparatively worse on suicide mortality (16·3, 
11·5–21·1). Results for each indicator and country can be 
explored through the online data visualisation tool.
Scores for NCD mortality were worst in Afghanistan 
and in many countries in Oceania; the best scores 
were primarily among higher-SDI countries, with the 
exception of Peru (figure 1). Most countries with the 
best alcohol use scores were in north Africa and 
the Middle East, whereas countries with the worst 
values were generally concentrated in Europe. The 
worst smoking prevalence scores were found among a 
heterogeneous set of locations (eg, Greenland, Kiribati, 
and Montenegro), and the best were primarily found 
in sub-Saharan Africa. Suicide mortality scores were 
generally best in countries in the Middle East and worst 
in a variety of countries (eg, Greenland, Lesotho, and 
Lithuania).
The worst scores for health worker density were 
primarily in sub-Saharan African countries; by contrast, 
Cuba, Qatar, and many European countries recorded 
among the best scores for this indicator. Several 
Latin American countries had the worst scores for sexual 
violence by non-intimate partners, whereas several 
countries in central Asia, eastern Europe, and south Asia 
had the best scores for this indicator.
During 2008–17, 165 countries conducted at least 
one population and housing census. 30 countries had 
existing or had implemented population registries 
during this time, and eight of these countries had 
conducted at least one census since 2008 (appendix 2). 
Eight countries did not have this important source of 
demographic information over the full time period.
Global and subnational variation
Performance on the health-related SDG index in 2017 
varied globally (figure 2) and at the subnational level 
(figure 3). Countries in the tenth decile of performance—
those with the best index values—were primarily in 
western Europe, although Canada, Japan, and Singapore 
were also in this decile. Afghanistan was in the first 
decile of performance, which otherwise predomin 
antly 
included countries in sub-Saharan Africa.
Among the countries with subnational SDG index 
scores (figure 3), India (which ranked in the third 
decile nationally) had the largest range in 2017, with a 
34·9-point difference between states with the highest 
and lowest scores. China also had considerable sub-
national differences, performing in the sixth decile 
nationally but recording a 19·3-point difference in scores 
across provinces, followed by the USA (ninth decile 
nationally and a 14·8-point difference across states) and 
Mexico (seventh decile nationally and a 15·3-point differ-
ence across states). Scores were most homo 
geneous in 
Japan (tenth decile nationally and a 3·0-point difference 
across subnational locations), the UK (tenth decile 
nationally and a 3·6-point difference across regions in 
England), and Brazil (eighth decile nationally and an 
8·0-point difference across states). 
Variation by sex and SDI
Globally, the median age-standardised NCD mortality 
rate, as it aligns with the UN definition, was higher for 
males (472·0 [IQR 330·5–604·9] per 100 000) than for 
Figure 1: Performance on the health-related SDG index and 40 individual 
health-related indicators, by location, in 2017
Countries and territories are ranked by their health-related SDG index from highest 
to lowest in 2017. Indices and individual indicators are reported on a scale of 0 to 
100, with 0 representing the worst scores from 1990 to 2030 and 100 reflecting 
the best during that time. SDG indicator 17.19.2a, population census status within 
the past 10 years, was not included in the health-related SDG index because 
projections were not generated for this indicator. Definitions of health-related SDG 
indicators are shown in table 1. FP need met, mod=family planning need met with 
modern contraception methods. NCD=non-communicable disease. 
NTD=neglected tropical disease. PM2·5=fine particulate matter smaller than 2·5 μm. 
SDG=Sustainable Development Goal. UHC=universal health coverage. 
WaSH=water, sanitation, and hygiene.

females (307·8 [215·4–417·9] per 100 000; figure 4). 
Variation by sex was also pronounced for alcohol use 
(18·5% [IQR 8·4–27·3] of males vs 6·4% [2·2–11·8] of 
females), smoking prevalence (25·0% [IQR 17·2–34·7] of 
males vs 6·1% [3·0–15·8] of females), and suicide 
mortality (13·8 [IQR 8·8–19·7] per 100 000 males vs 4·0 
[2·5–5·6] per 100 000 females; figure 4).
NCD mortality showed an inverse association 
with SDI quintile, with the lowest mortality in high-
SDI countries. Males in high-middle-SDI countries 
were the exception, recording higher mortality rates 
than males in middle-SDI and low-middle-SDI 
countries. Disparities in NCD mortality by sex emerged 
across SDI quintiles, particularly among high-
middle-SDI countries, for which the median age-stan-
dardised mortality rate was 512·4 (IQR 356·2–643·9) 
per 100 000 males and 285·9 (250·1–333·6) per 
100 000 females. Alcohol use was generally higher 
among higher-SDI quintiles, although differences 
between sexes were smallest in low-SDI and low-
middle-SDI countries. Smoking prevalence was also 
higher among higher-SDI quintiles, with the exception 
of males in high-SDI countries who had a lower 
smoking prevalence than males in high-middle-SDI 
countries. Differences between sexes were pronounced 
across SDI quintiles but were often smallest in high-
SDI countries. The median age-standardised suicide 
mortality rate showed a U-shaped pattern, with the 
highest rates in high-SDI and low-SDI countries.
Overall, males had worse health outcomes—higher 
mortality, incidence, and risk exposure—than females 
for all ten disaggregated indicators globally and across 
SDI quintiles; the primary exception was HIV incidence 
among low-SDI countries, where the incidence was 
higher in females than in males (figure 4). In 2017, 
the global median age-standardised incidence of HIV 
was 0·14 (IQR 0·04–0·37) per 1000 males versus 
0·07 (0·02–0·30) per 1000 females. For tuberculosis, 
the global median age-standardised incidence was 
48·9 (IQR 18·6–211·2) per 100 000 males and 39·7 
(14·8–187·0) 
per 
100 000 
females. 
Overall, 
age-
standardised mortality rates for road injuries and 
poisoning were lower among higher-SDI countries. In 
2017, the global median mortality rate from road injuries 
was 21·5 (IQR 12·9–32·5) per 100 000 males and 7·0 
(4·0–12·1) per 100 000 females, while the equivalent for 
poisoning mortality was 0·8 (0·4–1·7) per 100 000 males 
and 0·4 (0·2–0·8) per 100 000 females.

Health-related SDGs in 2030 and target attainment
On the basis of past trends, most countries were 
projected to have higher health-related indices in 2030 
than in 2017 (appendix 2). For the health-related SDG 
indicators with defined targets (figure 5; appendix 2), 
the probability of attainment by 2030 varied sub 
stan-
tially across locations and by indicator. Under-5 
mortality, neonatal mortality, maternal mortality ratio, 
and malaria had at least 100 countries or territories 
with at least a 95% probability of attaining defined 
targets in 2030. Indicators including vaccine coverage, 
HIV incidence, neglected tropical diseases prevalence, 
non-intimate partner violence, well-certified death 
registration, and environmental risks such as sanitation 
and household air pollution showed substantial hetero-
geneity in terms of projected attainment, with many 
locations recording probabilities of less than 10% and 
others recording probabilities of 95% or higher. For 
nine indicators, including child overweight, road in-
jury mortality, and tuberculosis, all 195 countries and 
territories had lower than 5% probability of attainment 
by 2030.
Figure 6 shows the distribution of annualised rates of 
change in 195 locations for 1990–2015. For several 
indicators, the global required annualised rates of change 
were met or exceeded by many countries not in the top 
decile of performance from 1990 to 2015. These indicators 
generally had value-specific SDG targets, such as under-5 
mortality (ie, ≤25 deaths per 1000 livebirths), or had 
targets linked to universal access or coverage of specific 
interventions (ie, vaccine coverage and met need for 
family planning). Furthermore, most of these indicators

had origins in the Millennium Development Goals era. 
Despite substantial progress in the past, only countries 
in the top decile of performance for 1990–2015 met or 
surpassed the global rate of change required to meet the 
maternal mortality ratio target for 2030 (ie, <70 deaths 
per 100 000 livebirths), and very few countries recorded 
the rates of change required at the global level to meet 
the UHC service coverage target by 2030. A similar 
pattern emerged for NCD mortality. For other health-
related SDG indicators, the global annualised rates of 
change required to meet their SDG targets far exceeded 
the pace of progress ever recorded by any country in the 
past (figure 6). These included several elimination 
indicators for infectious diseases, such as HIV and 
tuberculosis, and environmental risks such as household 
air pollution, among others (figure 6; appendix 1).
For NCD mortality and suicide mortality, performance 
at the global mean percentile of past rates of change 
(90th percentile) aligned with defined SDG targets of 
reducing rates by a third from 2015 to 2030 (ie, the 
equivalent of a 32·5% reduction for NCD mortality and a 
31·4% reduction for suicide mortality; table 2). Yet, for 
several indicators, performance at the 90th percentile 
would not equate to meeting established SDG targets. 
Many indicators with elimination targets saw the widest 
gaps in how the 90th percentile could translate into 
global attainment in the SDG era. For example, indicators 
under SDG target 2.2, which aims to end all forms of 
malnutrition, would see the global average for child stun-
ting decrease to 18·0% and wasting to 5·0% in 2030 if 
the 90th percentiles of past rates of change are achieved. 
For child overweight, the 90th percentile equated to a 
0·5% decrease by 2030, from a global average of 15·9% in 
2015 to 15·8% in 2030. SDG target 3.3 calls for ending 
the epidemics of several infectious diseases, including 
tuberculosis, HIV, and neglected tropical diseases; based 
on the 90th global mean percentile, the global percentage 
change from 2015 to 2030 would fall short of such 
aspirations for most of these causes (ie, decrease of 
7·9% for hepatitis B, 35·6% for tuberculosis, 53·4% for 
HIV, and 48·2% for neglected tropical diseases). The 
exception was malaria, which would decrease by 94·0% at 
the 90th percentile.
For two leading risk factors, alcohol use (SDG 
indicator 3.5.2) and prevalence of current smoking (SDG 
indicator 3.a.1), annualised rates of change in the 
90th percentile would equate with 18·7% and 21·9% 
reductions, respectively, at the global level from 2015 to 
2030 (table 2). Global percentage declines would range 
from 41·5% for mor 
tality attributable to ambient air 
pollution and household air pollution (SDG indi-
cator 3.9.1) to 68·1% for mortality attributable to unsafe 
water, sanitation, and hygiene (SDG indicator 3.9.2), 
reflecting the substantive improvements in reducing 
mortality attributable to these risks that many countries 
achieved in 1990–2015. If the 90th percentile was used as 
an SDG target, adolescent birth rates would need to 
decrease by 47·4%, or to a global average of 11·4 per 
1000 females aged 10–19 years in 2030, and health worker 
density would need to increase by 85·4%, from an 
average of 5·9 per 1000 population in 2015 to 10·9 per 
1000 population in 2030.
Discussion
Summary of findings
Although nearly all countries were projected to have 
improved health-related SDG index scores by 2030, 
progress varied by country and across individual indi-
cators. Performance on health-related SDG indi 
cators 
differed subnationally for several countries, as well as by 
sex and across SDI quintiles, highlighting the need for 
disaggregated data to ensure that no one is left behind. 
For many indicators, the annualised rate of change 
required to meet defined targets far exceeded the pace of 
progress achieved by any country in the recent past. Yet, 
even for those indicators with a mean projected value 
that fell short of the 2030 target, there was some 
probability of attainment by 2030, highlighting the 
potential for future SDG achievements if progress can be 
accelerated in the coming years. These results highlight 
the need for more rapid yet strategic implementation of 
programmes and continued monitoring of inequalities 
in the health-related SDGs within populations.
SDG indicator progress and challenges
Health-related SDG index scores were projected to be 
higher in 2030 than in 2017 in almost all countries; 
however, improved index performance does not inher-
ently reflect whether or not countries will attain 
individual SDG targets. The composite nature of the 
index means that many factors have a part in deter-
mining a country’s overall score, and ensuring that 
progress on the index score translates into progress 
across indicators and equitably across populations will 
continue to be a challenge for countries.
Countries that performed well on the health-related 
SDG index commonly scored worse on the individual 
indicators of childhood overweight and alcohol use than 
on other indicators. Among countries that performed 
worst on the health-related SDG index, well-certified 
death registration was a frequent challenge. As popu-
lations age, all countries will need to strengthen health 
information systems to ensure death registration keeps 
pace with increasing mortality in older populations.23 
Although suicide mortality and alcohol use prevalence 
appeared to be lowest in many countries in north Africa 
and the Middle East, in places where these practices are

deemed illegal or shameful, our results might reflect a 
dearth of accurate data rather than true circumstances.39,40
Without a concerted scale-up of efforts to prevent and 
treat NCDs, most countries will fall short of the 2030 
SDG target.9 The NCDs included in SDG indicator 
3.4.1—cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes, and 
chronic respiratory diseases—accounted for 82·8% of all 
deaths due to NCDs in 2017
.21 Total deaths due to NCDs 
increased from 9·5 million in the population aged 
30–69 years in 1990 to 12·9 million in 2017 (or 62·9% of 
all deaths in that age group).23 Of those 12·9 million 
deaths, 6·3 million were due to cardiovascular diseases, 
4·9 million to cancers, 1·1 million to chronic respiratory 
diseases, and 0·6 million to diabetes.23 Although the 
absolute number of deaths due to NCDs is rising 
annually, in most countries, this increase is the result of 
population ageing and growth; with the exception of 
diabetes, age-standardised NCD mortality rates for NCDs 
included in the SDG indicator have generally decreased.23 
Nonetheless, many NCD-related risk exposures have 
seen minimal changes over time or are increasing, 
portending future challenges if more deliberate action is 
not taken against NCDs.21
In many countries, reductions in mortality due to 
cardiovascular diseases have been driven by improved 
access to antihypertensives and statins for addressing 
high cholesterol.41,42 Investing in programmes that 
promote the early diagnosis and control of such metabolic 
risks should be prioritised by national govern 
ments and 
development partners.43 Furthermore, prevention of 
other modifiable risk factors, such as smoking, harmful 
alcohol consumption, and obesity, should also be a 
priority, as advocated by WHO’s best buys for NCD 
control, including taxation of alcohol and tobacco and 
reduced salt intake.44 Yet, national financing of NCD 
programmes remains low, with patients often paying 
out-of-pocket for related services,45 and surveil 
lance and 
reporting of NCDs are still sparse in many regions.46 The 
lack of action against NCDs is a current paradox of global 
health: despite numerous high-profile com 
mitments and 
robust evidence underscoring the impact of NCDs, the 
actual scale-up and maintenance of NCD-related 
interventions and programmes is lacklustre at best.9 
Inadequate access to affordable diagnostics and treat-
ment, poor prioritisation of NCD risk-prevention pro-
grammes, and low overall UHC are among challenges 
facing many low-SDI and middle-SDI countries.42,47 
Political influences and corporate interests might also 
affect the effectiveness of NCD programmes and 
policies, particularly those targeting sugar and alcohol 
consumption.48,49
Our estimates from 2017 indicate that 47·2% of 
countries and territories have less than one physician per 
1000 population and 46·2% have less than three nurses 
or midwives per 1000 population. The largest gaps in 
health worker density were found in sub-Saharan Africa, 
although density was also low in southeast Asia, south

Asia, and some countries in Oceania. GBD 2017 provides 
consistently estimated time series across locations for 
health worker density as an SDG indicator and by cadre, 
which supports supplementary analyses of the types and 
numbers of health workers required to deliver particular 
sets of interventions or health programmes. For instance, 
the threshold of 23 physicians, nurses, or midwives 
per 10 000 population, which was set by WHO in 2006, 
was a widely referenced minimum required to provide 
essential maternal and child health services during the 
Millennium Development Goals era.50 12 years later, this 
recommendation persists, despite it being likely that very 
different health workforce quantities, composition, and 
quality of training are needed to provide a broader range 
of effective health-care services—particularly as more 
countries aim to make progress towards UHC.
With their explicit emphasis on eliminating violence, 
the SDGs offer an opportunity to reduce and prevent 
violence against females and children.51 This is the first 
time that a global development agenda has prioritised all 
forms of violence, including violence against females 
and children, homicides, and armed conflicts. Reliable 
information and evidence are required to develop 
programmes and policies to prevent violence, as well as 
to demand accountability and resources from govern-
ments, civil society, and international institutions when 
violent acts occur. As a result, it is vital to strengthen 
routine reporting of violence across all ages, and to 
ensure that accurate, timely measures of violence are 
accompanied by effective support and systems for 
survivors of violent acts to enable long-term recovery.
Monitoring the health-related SDGs by sex and SDI
Despite the major part sex has in determining health 
behaviours and outcomes, only a third of the global 
health organisations included in the Global Health 50/50 
report produce data disaggregated by sex.52 Data disag-
gregated by sex are crucial to uncovering key sex 
inequalities in health from which gender inequalities can 
be inferred or extrapolated.
Several studies53–58 have shown that sex differences in 
health outcomes vary across causes of disease and 
disability. However, differences in health between sexes 
are less clear than is often assumed.59 Although males 
generally had worse outcomes than females for most 
indicators disaggregated in this study, this pattern might 
not hold true for many of the health-related SDG 
indicators that are not currently disaggregated by sex. 
Increased sex-specific collection of data, modelling, and 
reporting are needed, particularly for health-related SDG 
indicators related to child or neonatal mortality.
We showed that SDI quintile is also related to sex-
specific patterns. For example, although globally, HIV 
incidence is higher in males, a large portion of the global 
HIV incidence occurs in lower-SDI countries in sub-
Saharan Africa, where incidence is higher in females.23

similar patterns by sex: on average, males were more 
likely than females to smoke and consume harmful 
levels of alcohol, and while use was often higher among 
people living in higher-SDI countries, sex differences in 
these countries were also more pro 
nounced.60,61 Although 
the global smoking prevalence decreased from 1990 to 
2017, particularly in males in high-SDI countries, some 
low-SDI and middle-SDI countries saw increasing 
prevalence in females.61 Alcohol use did not show similar 
rates of decline, which is unlikely to change in the 
absence of effective legal instruments and taxation 
policies.62–65 Further research is needed to understand the 
role of attitudes and practices associated with smoking 
and alcohol use by sex.66–70
Measuring progress at the subnational level
It is well known that national averages mask subnational 
disparities within countries, and the results of the health-
related SDG index at the subnational level showed 
substantial differences in performance within countries, 
particularly in India and China. Differences between 
localities were lowest in Japan and the UK. Across 
countries, the states with the lowest SDG index scores in 
the USA (Mississippi, Arkansas, West Virginia, and 
Nevada) had lower scores than did 17 states in Mexico 
and 12 states in Brazil, while ten states in the USA had 
lower scores than Shanghai.
Disparities on the health-related SDGs at the sub-
national level were particularly pronounced among low-
SDI and middle-SDI countries, indicating that greater 
invest 
ments in targeting the most vulnerable or 
disadvantaged people in a country are probably required 
to improve the health of the entire population. Generally, 
we found that higher-SDI countries had less variation in 
their performance among first administrative levels; 
however, differences at more focal levels (eg, counties in 
the USA and municipalities in Brazil) and by age and sex 
might still present considerable challenges to reaching 
the SDG aims of leaving no one behind. Identifying such 
gaps is a necessary first step to focus the attention of 
local decision makers when targeting resources and

Figure 5: Comparing the probability of attainment for defined health-related 
SDG indicator targets based on past trends, by location, in 2030
Countries and territories are ranked from highest to lowest by the total number of 
SDG indicator targets they are projected to attain on the basis of mean estimates 
for 2030. Numbers preceding the country names are the numbers of targets 
projected to be met by each country or territory based on means. Values reported 
reflect the probability of projected attainment based on the percentage of draws 
that fell above or below defined targets in 2030. Of the 41 health-related indicators 
measured in this study, 25 had defined targets linked to each indicator. SDG 
target 3.6 aims to reduce road injury mortality by 50% between 2015 and 2020, 
and thus attainment for this indicator is based on estimates from 2015 to 2020 
rather than 2015 to 2030. Definitions of health-related SDG indicators and targets 
associated with them, as well as the specific target thresholds applied, are shown in 
table 1. FP need met, mod=family planning need met with modern contraception 
methods. NCD=non-communicable disease. Non-int=non-intimate. 
NTD=neglected tropical disease. reg=registration. SDG=Sustainable Development 
Goal. UHC=universal health coverage.

programmes. Few reports of countries seeking to address 
SDGs at the local level exist, although many countries 
have published voluntary reports of SDG progress with 
national-level data.71–77
Owing to the broad and multisectoral nature of the 
health-related SDG indicators, a whole-government 
approach is needed to strengthen their monitoring. Data 
are needed to inform planning and investment. Dis-
aggregation of data can empower local administrations 
and improve local health information systems—an 
important government need beyond reporting indicator 
progress—but it is unlikely that it will be sufficient to 
identify all health inequalities.19,20 The increased number 
of national and subnational units included in GBD 2017 
is in line with the recommendation of the High Level 
Political Forum on Sustainable Development to produce 
regular voluntary national reviews of progress at national 
and subnational levels.78 The production of subnational 
estimates for the GBD study is not intended to substitute 
for country-level reporting; on the contrary, we hope that 
the dissemination of these results might help stimulate 
subnational reporting in a proactive manner.79
Setting and assessing SDG targets
Projected attainment differed substantially among 
indicators with defined SDG targets. This pattern was 
particularly true for indicators that had few countries 
projected to meet targets based on mean values but had 
relatively more countries that showed some probability 
of attaining them by 2030. For some indicators with 
strong links to the Millennium Development Goals era—
eg, maternal mortality ratio, child mortality, malaria, and 
skilled birth attendance—more than 50% of countries 
were projected to meet 2030 targets; furthermore, of 
those countries not projected to achieve these targets 
based on their mean values, many showed some 
probability of attainment by 2030. These findings 
highlight possible trajectories for meeting targets if 
progress can be accelerated in the future. 
Nonetheless, based on past rates of progress, no 
country is currently on track to meet all defined health-
related SDG targets. For under-5 mortality, which has 
many countries on track for or already achieving the 
target of 25 deaths or fewer per 1000 livebirths by 2030, 
31 countries or territories would need to achieve annual 
Figure 6: Global annualised rate of change required to meet selected SDG targets based on annualised rate of change achieved by countries or territories, 1990–2015
For the 25 SDG indicators with defined targets, we estimated the required global annualised rate of change (dotted line) required to meet each target using the global average in 2015 and specific 
thresholds to be met by 2030 or relative reductions to be achieved by 2030. The top performing decile (the 10th decile) is shown in blue and all other annualised rates of change are shown in red. 
A subset of SDG indicators with defined targets are shown here; the remaining plots can be found in appendix 2. Definitions of health-related SDG indicators and targets associated with them are shown 
in table 1. FP need met, mod=family planning need met with modern contraceptive methods. NCD=non-communicable disease. SDG=Sustainable Development Goal. UHC=universal health coverage.

rates of decline from 2015 to 2030 that are two to 
ten times higher than what was recorded for 1990–2015. 
To bring such ambition closer to reality for all 
populations, the UN and other agencies will need to 
provide technical leadership and financial support, 
particularly for the countries with the lowest health-
related SDG performance.
A subset of SDG indicators, such as NCD mortality and 
suicide mortality, represent both the expansion of the 
SDG agenda to encompass broader health priorities 
beyond the narrower focus of the Millennium 
Development Goals and the establishment of ambitious 
yet potentially more feasible targets to meet within a 
15 year time frame. At first glance, reducing NCD or 
suicide mortality by a third from 2015 to 2030—on 
average, the equivalent of a 2·7% reduction per year—
might not seem particularly ambitious. Yet, amid the 
rising number of total deaths due to NCDs and challenges 
associated with providing quality NCD services in 
many countries,23,34 this rate of change ranked in the 91st 
to 93rd percentiles of country-level annualised rates of 
change achieved from 1990 to 2015. However, to truly 
eliminate many health challenges, as the SDGs set out to 
do by 2030, most—if not all—countries will need to 
achieve rates of change that surpass those ever achieved 
in the past. This is particularly true for child overweight, 
for which most countries have only seen rising prevalence 
since 1990; tuberculosis, a disease that has received 
comparably less international funding than have HIV 
and malaria;79 road injury mortality; and most non-fatal 
violence measures. All countries had less than 
5% probability of attaining child overweight and road 
injury mortality targets, highlighting priority areas for 
intervention globally.
Our global attainment analysis, which is grounded in 
historical rates of change, offers a mechanism to assess 
the ambitiousness of undefined targets. For instance, 
SDG target 3.a calls for strengthening the implementation 
of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control 
in all countries, a target against which changes in current 
smoking prevalence are not easily evaluated. The 90th 
mean global percentile of country-level rates of change in 
current smoking prevalence was a 1·6% decline per year 
from 1990 to 2015, which equated to a 21·9% decrease 
from 2015 to 2030 at the global level. Notably, the GPW13 
calls for a 25% reduction in current tobacco use within 
5 years (ie, a 5·8% decline per year),3 a pace that far 
exceeds what countries have achieved in the recent past.
The setting of targets is both a technical and political 
exercise, aiming to balance important societal objectives 
with the reality that many bold targets might be 
challenging, if not impossible, to achieve within short 
periods of time. Instituting targets solely on the basis of 
past rates of change and data is unlikely to happen within 
global and national policy circles; even if it could occur, 
such an approach might be equally unhelpful given that 
galvanising new funds, innovations, and commitments 
to improving population health worldwide often requires 
setting sights beyond what seems possible today. Instead, 
we hope that the methods used in this study will be 
useful in providing technical underpinnings for setting 
realistic and achievable targets; in the long run, such 
targets are likely to be more effective in driving action. 
We view these results as an important entry point for 
charting possible pathways to accelerated gains by 2030, 
as well as identifying more tangible interim goalposts 
against which countries can track ongoing advances and 
needs. As the Inter-agency and Expert Group on 
Sustainable Development Goal Indicators and UN 
Statistical Commission prepare for their formal review 
and revision of the global indicator framework in 2020, 
these findings might serve as inputs for consideration.
The perceived feasibility of target attainment can shape 
how international institutions, funding agencies, and 
countries approach health challenges. In particular, strict 
interpretation of the UN’s targets for elimination or 
universal coverage sets very high bars for success 
(eg, 100% coverage or elimination). Although elimination

Using the global average observed in 2015 for each of the 25 health-related indicators with defined targets, we calculated the global annualised rates of change required to meet these targets by 2030 (or by 2020 in 
the case of road injury mortality). The global required annualised rates of change were then compared with country-level annualised rates of change calculated from 1990 to 2015. The percentiles in which the global 
required annualised rates of change fell among country-level annualised rates of change in the past were ascertained, and then the average of these percentiles was computed (90th percentile) to serve as a way to 
assess defined SDG targets and potential targets for indicators that do not currently have defined SDG targets. The 90th percentile annualised rates of change observed for each indicator was applied to the global 
average in 2015 to compute the equivalent average in 2030 and percentage change from 2015 to 2030 if these rates of change are achieved during the SDG era. SDG=Sustainable Development Goal.

has been achieved for some diseases in various settings 
(eg, malaria and a subset of neglected tropical diseases), 
truly ending an epidemic is much more complex for 
others, especially in the absence of fully effective vaccines 
or a radical cure. For other SDG indicators, such as 
intimate partner violence, elimination should be wholly 
feasible; yet to completely end all violent acts would 
require societal, cultural, political, and legal structures 
to fully align. Without more concrete strategies and 
funding for elimination, setting such ambitious targets 
could risk setting countries up for short-term failure 
and longer-term obstacles to instituting sustainable 
programmes; such arguments have been recently made 
about ambitions to eliminate HIV.80 Nonetheless, HIV 
remains a massive public health threat, particularly 
because global financing has plateaued, domestic health 
spending on HIV has stayed low among high-burden 
countries,79 and its incidence has not declined as quickly 
in younger as in older populations.26 It could also be 
argued that aiming for elimination but falling short in 
2030 would still substantially improve the lives of 
millions and facilitate medical breakthroughs that might 
not be funded without a global elimination campaign. 
How best to galvanise accelerated action against the 
world’s largest health challenges is far from clear; going 
forward, the GBD study can offer international agencies 
and countries alike a platform through which different 
operationalisations of SDG targets can be tested.
Comparisons with other assessments
International agencies and the GBD study began 
producing annual reports of country estimates for the 
health-related SDG indicators in 2016. Of the 52 health-
related indicators, GBD 2017 reported on 41, WHO 
reported on 37 in its 2018 World Health Statistics report,6 
the World Bank covered 33 in its 2018 SDG Atlas,7 and 
the 
Sustainable 
Development 
Solutions 
Network 
included 27
.4 Standardisation of definitions and methods 
used to calculate the health-related SDG indicators could 
improve comparability across organisations and collab-
orations involved in monitoring the SDGs. The complete 
set of metadata for SDG indicators, provided by the 
UN and other international organisations, comes with 
instructions on how indicators should be measured.81 
However, GBD approaches to measurement differ from 
WHO approaches in various ways. For example, we 
use age-standardised rates for indicators that include 
mortality or incidence (eg, NCD mortality, suicide 
mortality, probability of death), whereas WHO generally 
use all-age rates. Furthermore, we define child overweight 
in terms of body-mass index for age and sex to align with 
the definition of overweight and obesity for adults, rather 
than in terms of weight for height. We also include all 
women of reproductive age in measurement of the met 
need for family planning indicator rather than limiting 
this measure to only women who are married or in 
a union. GBD also offers estimates for more years 
and locations than other organisations currently do, 
supporting the overarching SDG endeavour of leaving no 
one behind.
Strengths
An important strength of GBD 2017 is the increasing 
number of collaborators involved: participation increased 
by more than 44% from 2016, with collaborators from 
144 countries and two territories. The collaborator 
network offers multiple benefits to the GBD study, and in 
the case of the SDGs, it provides the particular benefit of 
supporting international and national policy dialogue, 
connecting technical infor 
mation to the political needs 
of the health-related SDGs. Health programmes and 
plans have a limited chance of success in the absence of 
robust evidence and policy dialogue. The benchmarking 
presented in GBD 2017 can help countries to promote 
and increase account 
ability at the national level. The 
bottom line is the need to enhance mutual understanding 
of the SDG agenda across the entire global range 
of stakeholders and to champion the importance of 
national ownership of local guidance, monitoring, and 
management in achieving SDG targets.
To facilitate comparisons across locations and over 
time of the diverse array of health-related SDG indicators, 
we have produced an overall SDG index since 
GBD 2015.5,13 The health-related SDG index is not 
presented in lieu of monitoring individual indicators, 
which we also do here. Instead, this index provides a 
mechanism by which overall performance across health-
related SDGs can be more easily compared. A single, 
robust measure 
ment such as the health-related SDG 
index is a useful tool for policy makers and other decision 
makers to interpret the performance of a particular 
location. With the production of time trends for several 
indicators, the SDG index also facilitates the under-
standing of the pace of progress. While index values 
represent a combination of different dimensions con-
sidered together as a proxy of health-related SDG 
indicator performance, results reported by individual 
indicator allow for more nuanced analyses.
Limitations of indicator measurement
Our measurement of the health-related SDG indicators 
is subject to the limitations of the broader GBD 2017 
study and its estimation processes; details can be found 
in the accompanying GBD 2017 capstone papers23–27 and 
in appendix 1 (part 1). Beyond these limitations, there 
are other important limitations that are specific to this 
analysis.
First, for measurement of health worker density we 
used ISCO 88 codes as the base classification system 
instead of ISCO 08, which is a more recent system than 
ISCO 88 that offers greater detail and standardisation. 
However, few occupational data sources currently include 
ISCO 08 codes, and benchmarking all past surveys to 
ISCO 08 would have resulted in substantial information 
 Global Health Metrics
2120

loss. In future GBD iterations, we aim to collate more 
recent occupational data and to further refine health 
worker cadre mapping. Additionally, the UN includes 
density of dentist personnel in health worker density 
estimates, but the GBD study does not because including 
the four health cadres leads to counterintuitive results. 
Finally, the measure of health worker density can reveal 
only the quantity, not the quality, of available care.
Second, continued data sparsity for many violence 
measures, particularly for males and non-intimate 
partners, results in comparatively high uncertainty for 
these SDG indicators. Data on the prevalence of any 
form of violence are also subject to a number of 
measurement biases. All data for these indicators are 
self-reported and subject to recall bias and varying 
interpretations of survey questions. Variation in case-
definitions or survey questions used by different surveys 
might also lead to increased uncertainty. We did not 
estimate psychological violence because there was 
no good standard for how to consistently measure it. 
Cultural influences, legal barriers to reporting, and 
stigma can also lead to underreporting and make the 
interpretation of self-reported data challenging, partic-
ularly for sensitive topics such as violence and other self-
reported SDG indicators. Suicide is another indicator 
that might be affected by religious, cultural, and legal 
barriers to reporting. Accurate monitoring of violence 
measures requires routine, carefully implemented data 
collection, experienced interviewers, and thoughtful 
design for data intake, as well as ensuring that adequate 
protections and resources are available for victims of 
violence.
Third, owing to overall data sparsity, many challenges 
remain in modelling of both temporal and age patterns 
for non-fatal health outcomes; for the SDGs, this 
challenge is particularly pronounced for hepatitis B. Our 
current hepatitis B vaccine coverage covariate, a key 
input into hepatitis B incidence modelling, is limited 
to infant vaccination coverage. Because the current iter-
ation of DisMod-MR cannot accommodate age-specific 
covariates, the effects of vaccination in older children and 
young adults for countries with long-running hepatitis B 
vaccination programmes (eg, Taiwan [province of China]) 
are not well captured. A priority of future GBD iterations 
is to use a version of DisMod that will allow for age-
specific covariates, which will benefit hepatitis B 
modelling. Additionally, expanding the underlying data 
inputs for hepatitis seroprevalence, particularly for age 
groups that have benefited from vaccination programmes, 
has the potential to substantially improve hepatitis B 
estimation; for instance, the Polaris Observatory has 
markedly increased its seroprevalence data collection 
efforts in recent years, and such data have yet to be 
incorporated into the GBD study.
Fourth, our estimates of UHC currently only capture 
service coverage and do not include the second 
dimension of financial risk protection. The addition of 
financial risk protection and catastrophic health spending 
is a priority for future iterations of the GBD study. 
Ongoing review by the WHO Task Force on Metrics 
for GPW13 will likely yield recommendations that will 
inform future GBD revisions of how to measure UHC 
service coverage.
Fifth, the UN’s metadata definition for vaccine coverage 
includes the human papillomavirus vaccine, but we do 
not currently include this vaccine owing to the limited 
number of countries with available data. Future iterations 
of the GBD study will aim to estimate human papilloma-
virus vaccine coverage.
Sixth, conflicts and refugee populations might affect 
SDG indicator trends in ways not well captured by our 
data. Although these factors introduce additional un-
certainty to our estimates, these populations cannot be 
ignored, and GBD strives to make the best estimates 
based on the available data.
Limitations of forecasting and attainment analyses
Generating forecasts has inherent limitations: when 
forecasts are grounded in past rates of change, we cannot 
fully account for what might occur between now and 
2030, including changes in health financing and global 
health priorities, conflict, and climate change. Positive 
developments, such as new medical advances, can be 
challenging to predict, as are negative events, such as the 
emergence of drug resistance. Continued improvements 
in our overall fore 
casting framework and specific 
approaches by cause, risk, and intervention have the 
potential to further advance our ability to understand 
how and where the largest challenges in making progress 
on the health-related SDGs might occur.
Limitations of indicator scaling and index construction
Ideally, we would systematically implement a scaling 
approach that accounts for the lowest possible levels 
of avoidable mortality, non-fatal outcomes, and risk 
exposures given current medical technologies and 
population-level interventions and the highest levels 
of coverage conditional upon measurable scale-up con-
straints or system inefficiencies. Scaling these indi 
cators 
to the 2·5th and 97·5th percentiles of 1000 draws over 
time approximates this approach and allows consistent 
comparison of performance across indicators and 
locations. Nonetheless, our scaling strategy can either 
mask the potential for further improve 
ments or imply 
worse performance, especially in relation to more 
modest SDG targets. Although the addition or refinement 
of new health-related SDG indicators with each GBD 
cycle is viewed as supportive of a more comprehensive 
assessment of the health-related SDGs, such updates can 
result in changes in individual countries’ overall index 
values and relative rankings (appendix 2). These changes 
reflect our efforts to collectively improve the data for and 
science of monitor 
ing the health-related SDGs. Overall 
index scores can be affected by indicators linked to fatal 
 Global Health Metrics

2121
discontinuities, whereby an abrupt increase in deaths 
one year might not be present in the following year. 
We continue to use the geometric mean for the health-
related SDG index. This decision might result in lower 
overall index scores for some locations if they experience 
worsening 
per 
formance 
on 
particular 
indicators; 
however, it provides a more direct reflection of how the 
SDGs have been established by the UN and UN member 
states.82
Limitations of data availability and disaggregation
GBD data are currently only available by sex, and not by 
gender, which limits the scope of analyses that can be 
conducted. The binary application of sex does not encom-
pass differences in transgender and other popu 
lations. 
We currently only present data disaggregated by sex for 
ten indicators. Further collection and disag 
gregation of 
data would strengthen the ability of the GBD to support 
additional sex-specific analyses. For some new indi-
cators, such as violence, some countries have better data 
collection systems in place than do others, and increased 
data collection is needed to make accurate comparisons 
between countries. Overall, the availability and repre-
sentative 
ness of reported numbers from each country, 
particularly low-SDI and middle-SDI countries, could be 
improved by increased data collection, surveillance, and 
reporting at the national level.
Future directions
Important refinements to our estimation process are 
made with each GBD iteration. As discussed already, one 
priority is to improve our measurement of UHC service 
coverage (SDG indicator 3.8.1), generate comprehensive 
estimates of catastrophic health expenditures (SDG 
indicator 3.8.2), and then ultimately develop an overall 
measure of UHC. In theory, UHC service coverage and 
catastrophic health expenditures (the inverse of financial 
risk protection) should be linked; however, to date, their 
measurement has generally involved separate en—
deavours. GBD and collaborators are working to update 
estimates of UHC in this direction in the near future, in 
line with the WHO/World Bank framework.83 We 
currently use the arithmetic mean to construct the UHC 
service coverage index; however, other methods of index 
construction might be considered for future analyses. 
Other future priorities include analysing results by age 
as well as by sex, generating subnational projections, 
decomposing potential drivers of indicator-level progress, 
and further advancing the quantity and quality of data 
used in overall GBD estimation. Two other indicators, 
coverage of substance use disorder treatment (SDG 
indicator 3.5.1) and populations who feel safe walking 
home alone (SDG indicator 16.1.4), also are candidates 
for future inclusion pending data availability and access. 
Furthermore, it might be worthwhile to revisit what 
constitutes health-related SDGs, particularly as the UN 
Statistical Commission prepares for its formal review of 
current indicators and proposed additions. Finally, in 
view of the reasonably short window for the SDG era, 
there is increasing interest in developing model-based 
scenarios wherein the effects of investment “X” or 
introduction of intervention “Y” can be explored. The 
forecasting frame 
work developed by Foreman and 
colleagues sets the foundation for such work36 given that 
the causal relationships captured and propagated 
through projections can be set at different levels or 
altered in response to funding changes (eg, 10% budget 
cut and its effects on HIV).83 
Conclusion
International institutions are increasingly calling for 
disaggregated data to guide decision making in health, 
and the SDGs are no exception. The SDG health-related 
index varied greatly at the subnational level in many 
countries, reflecting the need to focus on subnational 
health inequalities in the SDG era. Globally, males 
generally experienced a greater toll than did females 
from the ten health-related indicators analysed, 
emphasising the importance of both health data and 
programmes that incorporate sex-specific dimensions. 
Although most countries were projected to have 
improved SDG index scores in 2030, progress is slower 
than what is needed to attain defined targets across a 
wide range of health domains, including NCDs, which 
have many recommended best buy policies that have yet 
to be widely implemented. Countries and supporting 
international agencies must move beyond commitment 
to implemen 
tation, with a special focus on monitoring 
gains and gaps on the health-related SDGs beyond 
national trends. As shown by past rates of country-level 
progress, we have the opportunity to catalyse substantial 
gains in the future if the right investments and focus can 
occur today.

We thank the Russia Longitudinal Monitoring Survey, done by the 
National Research University Higher School of Economics and ZAO 
Demoscope, together with Carolina Population Center, University of 
North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and the Institute of Sociology of the 
Russian Academy of Sciences, for making these data available. This 
analysis uses data or information from the Longitudinal Ageing Study in 
India (LASI). The development and release of the LASI pilot study was 
funded by the National Institute on Aging (R21AG032572, 
R03AG043052, and R01 AG030153). Health Behaviour in School-aged 
Children (HBSC) is an international study performed in collaboration 
with the WHO Regional Office for Europe. The international coordinator 
of the 1997–98, 2001–02, 2005–06, and 2009–10 surveys was Candace 
Currie and the databank managers were Bente Wold for the 1997–98 
survey and Oddrun Samdal for the following surveys. A list of principal 
investigators in each country can be found on the HBCS website. The 
Health and Retirement Study is sponsored by the National Institute on 
Aging (grant number NIA U01AG009740) and done by the University of 
Michigan. This research uses data from Add Health, a programme 
project designed by J Richard Udry, Peter S Bearman, and Kathleen 
Mullan Harris, and funded by grant P01-HD31921 from the Eunice 
Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human 
Development, with cooperative funding from 17 other 
agencies. Ronald R Rindfuss and Barbara Entwisle are acknowledged for 
their assistance in the original design of Add Health. People interested 
in obtaining data files from Add Health should contact Add Health, 
Carolina Population Center, Chapel Hill, NC, USA (addhealth@unc.

The Costa Rican Longevity and Healthy Aging Study (CRELES) is a 
longitudinal study by the University of Costa Rica’s Centro 
Centroamericano de Población and Instituto de Investigaciones en 
Salud, in collaboration with the University of California at Berkeley. 
The original pre-1945 cohort was funded by the Wellcome Trust (grant 
072406), and the 1945–55 Retirement Cohort was funded by the 
US National Institute on Aging (grant R01AG031716). The principal 
investigators of CRELES are Luis Rosero-Bixby and William H Dow, 
and the co-principal investigators are Xinia FernÃ¡ndez and Gilbert 
Brenes. We used data from the 2009–10 Ghana Socioeconomic Panel 
Study Survey, which is a nationally representative survey of more than 
5000 households in Ghana. The survey is a joint effort undertaken by the 
Institute of Statistical, Social and Economic Research (ISSER) at the 
University of Ghana and the Economic Growth Center (EGC) at Yale 
University. It was funded by the EGC. ISSER and the EGC are not 
responsible for the estimations reported by the analysts. This study uses 
data from the WHO Study on global AGEing and adult health.
