Abstract
Background: Previous research has shown fluid replacement beverages ingested after exercise can affect hydration
biomarkers. No specific hydration marker is universally accepted as an ideal rehydration parameter following
strenuous exercise. Currently, changes in body mass are used as a parameter during post-exercise hydration.
Additional parameters are needed to fully appreciate and better understand rehydration following strenuous
exercise. This randomized, double-blind, parallel-arm trial assessed the effect of high-pH water on four biomarkers
after exercise-induced dehydration.
Methods: One hundred healthy adults (50 M/50 F, 31 ± 6 years of age) were enrolled at a single clinical research
center in Camden, NJ and completed this study with no adverse events. All individuals exercised in a warm
environment (30 °C, 70% relative humidity) until their weight was reduced by a normally accepted level of 2.0 ± 0.
2% due to perspiration, reflecting the effects of exercise in producing mild dehydration. Participants were
randomized to rehydrate with an electrolyzed, high-pH (alkaline) water or standard water of equal volume
(2% body weight) and assessed for an additional 2-h recovery period following exercise in order to assess any
potential variations in measured parameters. The following biomarkers were assessed at baseline and during their
recovery period: blood viscosity at high and low shear rates, plasma osmolality, bioimpedance, and body mass,
as well as monitoring vital signs. Furthermore, a mixed model analysis was performed for additional validation.
Results: After exercise-induced dehydration, consumption of the electrolyzed, high-pH water reduced high-shear
viscosity by an average of 6.30% compared to 3.36% with standard purified water (p = 0.03). Other measured
biomarkers (plasma osmolality, bioimpedance, and body mass change) revealed no significant difference between
the two types of water for rehydration. However, a mixed model analysis validated the effect of high-pH water on
high-shear viscosity when compared to standard purified water (p = 0.0213) after controlling for covariates such as
age and baseline values.
Conclusions: A significant difference in whole blood viscosity was detected in this study when assessing a
high-pH, electrolyte water versus an acceptable standard purified water during the recovery phase following
strenuous exercise-induced dehydration.

 Background
Water is an essential nutrient for life, and hydration plays a
critical role in human physical performance as well as in
the prevention of chronic diseases. Dehydration is a well-
accepted contributor to impaired human physical perform-
ance, resulting in guidelines established for fluid replace-
ment in many professions involving significant physical
activity, including athletes [1]. Performance impairments
that are mediated by dehydration can produce untoward
effects such as cardiovascular strain, heat strain, altered
neurologic function and altered metabolic function [2].
Reductions in body mass by 2% or more due to perspir-
ation during exercise have been well-established to be
linked with impaired aerobic and physiologic performance.
While this impairment involves metabolic, neurological, car-
diovascular and important thermoregulatory factors, the pri-
mary
limiting
factor
of
exercise
performance
is
cardiovascular drift, reflecting a shrinking cardiovascular re-
serve by reduced stroke volume and mean arterial pressure
during intense or protracted exercise, coupled with an in-
crease in heart rate [3]. Exercise-induced elevations in heart
rate with a decrease in myocardial stroke volume can correl-
ate closely with the degree of dehydration [2]. Dehydration
has been shown to increase systemic vascular resistance by
17 ± 6% compared with euhydration during prolonged exer-
cise (p < 0.05) [4].
Numerous studies have evaluated beverage rehydration
around exercise sessions, which have included supplemen-
tation with water, coconut water, juices, teas, sodas, as well
as carbohydrate, electrolyte and glycerol beverages [5–9]. In
a majority of these studies, fluid replacement beverages
were administered orally after a dehydration challenge and
the rehydration abilities of specific replacement beverages
were assessed using biomarkers, physical performance eval-
uations and subjective questionnaires. One study involving
6 healthy males suggested that higher vs. lower concentra-
tions of a carbohydrate-electrolyte solution were more
effective in restoring hydration following exercise [5]. A
study of 10 soccer players reported that exercise-induced
changes in body mass and plasma volume were smaller
with the ingestion of a carbohydrate-glycerol beverage than
a carbohydrate beverage, highlighting improved hydration
with the addition of glycerol [6]. Another study which mon-
itored hydration biomarkers showed that coconut water did
not hydrate significantly better than water alone [7].
Alkaline water (ALK) has been hypothesized to be superior
to standard purified water in restoring rehydration and
high-shear blood viscosity during a 2-h recovery period fol-
lowing exercise-induced dehydration; however, specific
structured studies of one or multiple biomarkers during re-
hydration following exercise have not established a gold
standard biomarker for recovery period. Therefore, we de-
signed a randomized, double-blind, parallel arm research
study to characterize and compare the magnitude and rate
of rehydration of high-pH electrolyzed water vs. standard
purified water by assessing serial levels of a specific bio-
marker of whole blood viscosity at high-shear rate as a pri-
mary endpoint. In addition to measuring whole blood
viscosity at high shear rate, the following secondary end-
points were assessed: low-shear blood viscosity, plasma
osmolality, bioimpedance, and changes in body weight.
Methods
This study, performed at the Waterfront Technology Center
(Camden, NJ), was a randomized, double-blind, parallel-arm,
controlled trial, which recruited 100 adult volunteers (50
male, 50 female), between 25 to 49 years of age. Eligible
participants were healthy, non-smoking adults, having a
body-mass index less of 29 or less and free from any medica-
tion for at least one week prior to the participation in the
study. Female participants were excluded from the study if
they were pregnant, breast-feeding, menstruating at the time
of screening, or if they had taken oral contraceptives in the
previous 3 months. Subjects were instructed to refrain from
strenuous activity, alcohol, and to limit excessive caffeine
intake (>2 six-ounce cups) for at least 24 h prior to their
assigned arrival on the study date. This clinical study was
approved by the Institutional Review Board, and written in-
formed consent was obtained from all subjects at the time of
enrollment and prior to participating in this study. The study
was registered (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02118883)
and conducted in accordance and compliance with Good
Clinical Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki.
Design of study
The two different fluid replacement beverages consisted
of standard bottled water as the control (CON), having a
normal pH with minerals added for taste (Dasani®, The
Coca-Cola Company, Atlanta, GA). The electrolyzed,
high-pH ALK with added minerals for taste acted as the
experimental treatment beverage (Essentia®, Essentia
Water, LLC, Bothell, WA). Supplies of both water
samples were stored in the same climate-controlled in-
door location and covered to prevent prolonged light
exposure.
Subjects were permitted to consume food and water at
will prior to the study. Following a baseline assessment, par-
ticipants were asked to refrain from food or fluid intake.
Baseline assessments for body mass, bioelectrical impedance
and vital signs (heart rate (HR), systolic (SBP) and diastolic
blood pressure (DBP), respiration rate, body temperature)
were collected at the initiation of the study prior to exercise.
Blood samples were collected by venipuncture for evaluation
of whole blood viscosity and plasma osmolality. Following
baseline measures, the subjects performed moderate aerobic
exercise sessions (using their choice of a treadmill, stationary
bicycle, and/or elliptical trainer) in a warm environment
(30 °C, 70% relative humidity) until they reached a

 dehydrated state. The duration of exercise varied between
subjects; however, the dehydration threshold target was
standardized to 2.0 ± 0.2% body weight loss due to the ef-
fects of a period of exercise in producing mild dehydration.
During the exercise period, participants dried themselves
thoroughly before each body mass measurement. A dispos-
able paper gown of known weight was provided during body
mass measurements. After the exercise period was com-
pleted and a dehydrated state attained, study participants
moved to a thermo-neutral environment (21 °C, 60% relative
humidity), where they rested for 20 min. After this rest
period, vital signs, weight and bioimpedance were assessed.
In addition, blood samples were collected for assessment of
blood viscosity and plasma osmolality.
A prior study, assessing the effect of oral carbohydrate
solution on rates of absorption reported an approximate
3% reduction in plasma volume during a 105-min inter-
val after beverage consumption [10]. The present study
incorporated a follow-up period of 120 min, which was
considered to be sufficiently long in duration to show
any effect of rehydration during recovery. The 120-min
follow-up period (T000 to T120 min), which followed
exercise and rest, was divided into a 30-min rehydration
period and a 90-min recovery period. Participants were
rehydrated orally by CON or ALK (T000 to T030 min).
The mass of the water consumed during the rehydration
period was calculated according to a participant’s body
mass change during the exercise period. The recom-
mended amount of rehydration fluids was determined
using a formula of 20 mL of oral hydration per 1 kg of
subject body weight, i.e. 2% of pre-exercise, baseline
body weight. Water volumes poured into containers were
measured using a precision scale (Intelligent-Lab PD-3000,
Intelligent Weighing Technology, Inc. Camarillo, CA) by
an unblinded coordinator who had no contact with any
participants or study results throughout the study. Subjects
were required to consume the entire quantity of designated
water following exercise ad libitum within 30 min (T000 to
T030 min). Blood samples were collected for whole blood
viscosity and plasma osmolality at T015 min and T030 min
during this rehydration period.
Additional data were collected during the 90-min
recovery period (T030 to T120 min) to fully assess any
potential
variations
in
measured
parameters.
Blood
viscosity and plasma osmolality were assessed seven
times: at baseline and at six subsequent intervals (T000,
T015, T030, T060, T090, and T120 min). Bioimpedance
analysis and body mass change measurements were
performed five times: at baseline and at four subse-
quent intervals (T000, T045, T075, and T120 min).
Vital signs were evaluated a total of three times: at
baseline, as well as at T000 and T120 min. A flow sheet
showing time points for each biomarker evaluation is
represented in Fig. 1.
Measured parameters
Whole blood viscosity
Whole blood viscosity, the inherent resistance of blood to
flow, was used as a measurement of intravascular hydra-
tion status. Blood viscosity was assessed across a physio-
logic range of shear rates of 1-1000 s-1 in increments of
0.1 s-1 using an automated scanning capillary tube viscom-
eter (Hemathix SCV-200, Health Onvector, King of Prus-
sia, PA). This instrument has been validated using rotating
cone-and-plate and couette type viscometers across a
range of shear rates [11]. Approximately 3 cc of whole
blood were collected for each blood viscosity test. Each
blood sample was processed and analyzed at 37 °C within
24 h after being collected. Blood viscosity levels were re-
ported
in
millipoise
units
(1
centipoise
[cP] = 1
millipascal-seconds [mPa•s] = 10 millipoises [mP]). Blood
viscosity values, measured at a high shear rate of 300 s-1,
were reported as systolic blood viscosity, and those mea-
sured at a low shear rate of 5 s-1 were reported as diastolic
blood viscosity.
Plasma osmolality
Once retrieving a blood sample, the plasma osmolality was
assessed within 24 h. Each sample was centrifuged at 5 °C
for 10 min at 1000 x g, and the plasma component was
shipped to a reference laboratory (Laboratory Corporation
of America, Burlington, NC), which performed the analysis
using a freezing-point depression osmometer (Advanced
Instruments, Norwood, MA).
Bioelectrical impedance
Bioelectrical impedance analysis, or bioimpedance, was per-
formed on site using a bioimpedance analyzer (Quantum IV,
RJL Systems, Clinton, MI). Subjects assumed a supine pos-
ition with their arms 30° from the body and their legs not
touching. Electrodes were placed on the right hand and right
foot of each subject and removed after each measurement.
On the subject’s hand, the signal electrode was placed on
the skin of the metacarpophalangeal joint of the middle
finger, and the detecting electrode was placed on skin of the
wrist. On the foot, the signal electrode was placed on the
skin at the base of the second toe, and the detecting
electrode was placed on the skin at the top of the ankle. The
following indices were recorded during each measurement:
impedance, reactance, capacitance, phase angle, total body
water, intracellular water, and extracellular water.
Body mass
Body mass index (BMI) was measured using a digital floor
scale (HealthOMeter 349KLX, Pelstar, LLC, McCook, IL).
Measurements were performed using a nude, dry weight,
with a dry gown of known weight provided for comfort.

 Determination of sample size
The scanning capillary viscometer used to assess the pri-
mary endpoint in this study was previously employed in a
preliminary study of dehydration and rehydration by high-
pH alkaline water in 15 nonsmoking, apparently healthy
firefighters. The variability of systolic blood viscosity
measurements (high-shear viscosity) and the rehydration
effect of high-pH alkaline on systolic viscosity observed in
this prior study population were used to determine the
sample size for this study [12]. In this firefighter trial, de-
hydration induced by fighting mock fires in training ses-
sion with full equipment produced mean systolic viscosity
values of 42.7 mP, and after rehydration, mean systolic
blood viscosity was significantly reduced to 38.8 mP (p =
0.003). A standard deviation of 2.6 mP observed at base-
line was used in determining our sample size for the
present study. We postulated that high-pH ALK would
demonstrate 40% greater rehydration effect than CON,
that is, rehydration by CON was hypothesized to reduce
mean systolic blood viscosity to 40.5 mP while ALK was
hypothesized to reduce systolic blood viscosity to 38.8 mP
from a dehydrated level of 42.7 mP. The present study
was powered to detect such a contrast with 90% power
using a type I error rate of 5%. This required 100 partici-
pants or 50 in the CON group and 50 individuals in the
ALK group.
Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses were performed using SAS (Statistical
Analysis System, Version 9.3, 2012, Cary, NC). The data
were analyzed using both descriptive and inferential
statistics.
Four
separate
analyses
were
pre-planned:
comparison of percent change in biomarkers, compari-
son of the slopes of regression lines, absolute differences,
and mixed model analyses.
A comparison of the percentage change of each outcome
measure was performed during the rehydration and recov-
ery period. Such an analysis was intended to compensate
for the individual differences at baseline and at T000 min
values. For example, the percentage change in the endpoint
parameter from T000 to T120 was computed for whole
blood viscosity (WBV) as:
WBV T000
ð
Þ – WBV T120
ð
Þ
WBV T000
ð
Þ
Mean values for each treatment group and estimates
of standard errors for each enabled confidence intervals
were to be computed and conclusions made based on
these differences.
Fitting a line to each set of endpoint data for each variable,
CON versus ALK were examined and statistical tests were
conducted on the difference of the slope parameter for each
line to determine if there was a significant overall treatment
effect on the rate of rehydration during the recovery period.
Regression procedure (PROC REG) was used in SAS to pro-
vide estimates of the best fitting line and of the slope and
intercept parameters and to generate the data plots. Faster
rehydration would be demonstrated for the group having a
steeper slope for the line fit to the data between T000 and
T120 min.
Absolute changes between baseline and each subsequent
time point were also computed for each of the outcome
parameters. Keeping the two assigned treatment groups
separate, a plot of the mean values was performed for each
of the outcome parameters at each time point starting at
baseline and continuing through T120 min after commen-
cing rehydration. By graphing each of the endpoints (y-axis)
vs. time (x-axis), an initial change in the outcome measure
between baseline and T000 was expected, as the latter was

 at or near the maximum point of dehydration and thus an
expected inflection point of the endpoint parameters.
Subsequently, a gradual restoration in these measures was
expected as rehydration occurred. The mean value at T000
was expected to serve to indicate the dehydration level for
each group. Mean and standard errors for each time
point were to be computed, allowing tests at any par-
ticular time point to be made comparing the two treat-
ment groups. Structuring 95% confidence intervals
(using mean ± 1.96 S.E.) around each point enabled dif-
ferences to be tested at every time point.
A final pre-planned analysis was employed for valid-
ation using a linear model approach but allowing for re-
peated measures generated for the outcome variables at
all time points. In this analysis, a mixed model was used
to specify observations at the different time points as
random effects, and included fixed effects such as treat-
ment (i.e., ALK vs. CON), age, baseline levels, and weight
loss at end of exercise (%) in the analysis. Then, the treat-
ment effect was estimated while controlling for these
covariates. Using mixed model procedure (PROC MIXED)
in SAS, the treatment effect comparing ALK vs. CON was
tested for each of the outcome variables.
Data displays of key outcome variables at each time
point starting at baseline and continuing through T120
min after start of rehydration are provided in Figs. 2, 3, 4
and 5. Mean and standard errors for each time point were
computed, allowing tests at any particular time point to be
made comparing the two groups. Structuring 95% confi-
dence intervals using mean ± 1.96 S.E. enabled absolute
differences to be tested. As shown in Figs. 2, 3, 4 and 5,
the 95% confidence intervals are displayed graphically for
the two treatment arms using error bars. Each pair of
confidence intervals displayed for the two treatment arms
observably overlapped.
The linear mixed models account for the correlational
structure inherent in these repeated measures data, as
intra-individual measures are more highly correlated than
inter-individual measures. Since there was only one pri-
mary endpoint and only one endpoint was used to

 estimate the sample size, all statistical tests were con-
ducted at the alpha = 0.05 level; no Bonferroni correction
was employed. For the mixed model analyses, a linear
model approach was used while allowing for the repeated
measures to be generated for outcome assessment. The
treatment effect was tested while controlling for the
following covariates: time point, age, dehydration weight
change, a gender-treatment-arm interaction effect, as well
as baseline levels for systolic blood viscosity, diastolic
blood viscosity, and plasma osmolality. Analyses of all
outcome variables were performed using a mixed model,
which takes into account intra-individual correlations
across repeated measures.
Results
One hundred adult participants completed the study. For
each subject, the study required approximately 4–8 h of
time on a single study date with no follow-up visits. Table 1
shows demographics of each study arm (CON versus
ALK), including average age and the number of subjects by
ethnicity were similar between the two study arms. Table 2
shows baseline characteristics for each study arm prior to
exercise, including systolic and diastolic blood viscosities,
hematocrit,
plasma
osmolality,
bioelectric

analysis, body weight, systolic and diastolic blood pres-
sures, heart rate, respiratory rate, and body temperature.
The CON and ALK subjects did not differ significantly
from baseline values.
The study involved between 4–8 h of time for each par-
ticipant, depending upon the duration of the exercise
period to achieve a dehydrated state. Study participants
were monitored by a registered nurse from enrollment to
discharge. There were no adverse events of any kind
during the study. There were also no clinically significant
abnormal values among the vital signs collected and la-
boratory evaluations performed. Systolic blood pressure,
DBP, HR, respiratory rate, and body temperature were re-
corded

 summarized in Table 3. Mean values for vital signs were
similar in the two study arms. In addition, mean values
with standard deviations for outcome parameters are also
provided in Table 3.
The percentage change during the rehydration period
from T000 to T120 min was computed for each outcome
measure, reflecting the overall magnitude of hydration
during the rehydration and recovery period, following stan-
dardized exercise-induced dehydration, while compensating
for inter-individual differences at baseline and T000 min.
Subjects acted as their own controls, and the inter-
individual variability of endpoints was moderated by divid-
ing the difference between the subject’s dehydrated state
(T000 min) and final rehydrated state (T120 min) by the
value of each subject’s own dehydrated state (T000 min).
After rehydration and recovery, the average percentage
change for systolic blood viscosity, measured at a high-
shear rate of 300 s-1, in subjects administered CON was
3.36%; whereas for ALK, the average percent change was
6.30% (p = 0.03). Nominally, ALK significantly reduced and
restored high-shear blood viscosity during a 120-min rehy-
dration
period
by
87.50%
more
than
CON.
After
rehydration and recovery, the average percentage change
for diastolic blood viscosity (measured at low-shear rate:
5 s-1) in subjects administered CON was 5.43%, while the
mean percent change for ALK was 9.35%. Furthermore, no
other outcome variables, serving as hydration markers,
demonstrated a significant difference between the two
treatment arms when comparing the percent change in the
outcome measure during the rehydration period (T000 to
T120 min, Table 4).
Further analyses, using PROC REG in SAS provided an
estimate of the best fitting line per treatment arm, as well
as the slope and intercept parameters. The period of rehy-
dration from T000 to T120 min was used to determine
the best-fit regression line for each arm and endpoint. No
significant difference was detected in the slope parameter
between the two treatment arms for each endpoint. This

 analysis of slopes was used to examine the rate of change
for each endpoint parameter during the rehydration
period (see Table 5). A significant difference between the
two treatment arms would reflect a faster hydration rate.
A trend was observed for mean systolic and diastolic
blood viscosity levels, which decreased faster (greater
negative slope) for ALK as compared with CON. Imped-
ance, an index derived from bioelectrical impedance ana-
lysis, was observed to increase faster (greater positive
slope) for ALK as compared with CON.
Figure 2 shows systolic blood viscosity changes as a
function of time, where the 2 treatment groups had
similar viscosity levels at baseline. The parallel slopes for
the 2 study arms measured from baseline to T000 min
(i.e., end of the exercise period and the beginning of the
rehydration period) suggests both study arms achieved a
similar rate of dehydration during exercise. After T000,
when the subjects began ingestion of water, a steeper
slope can be observed for the ALK group than for CON
group, demonstrating an enhancement in the recovery
period towards restoring pre-exercise baseline levels. By
T060 min, midway through the recovery period, mean
systolic viscosity levels for ALK subjects returned to the
pre-exercise baseline levels, whereas the CON did not
return to pre-exercise baseline levels even at T120 min.

 This pattern is observed visually in the graphic display
and consistent with the comparison of the percent
changes in systolic viscosity. However, these noted dif-
ferences that were significant using a comparison of per-
cent changes from T000 to T120 min could not be
detected using absolute differences based on 95% confi-
dence intervals, as shown in Fig. 2, probably due to the
large inter-individual variability.
Similar results were observed for diastolic blood vis-
cosity as shown in Fig. 3. The values at baseline were
even closer for the two groups. The increases found with
exercise, between baseline and T000, progressed at a
similar rate for both treatment groups. Based on mean
levels for diastolic viscosity, Fig. 3 shows a more pro-
nounced rehydration rate for ALK than CON with fail-
ure to return to baseline levels for mean diastolic
viscosity in the CON group by T120 min.
Using mixed model analyses, the treatment effect of
ALK vs. CON was observed to be significant for systolic
blood viscosity (p = 0.02). The treatment effect of ALK
vs. CON was not observed to be significant for the other
outcome measures of diastolic blood viscosity, plasma
osmolality, or the bioelectrical impedance indices. The
mixed model analysis appeared to confirm the signifi-
cant difference in the effect of ALK on blood viscosity,
showing that after controlling for the effect of multiple
covariates using a mixed model, ALK had a statistically
significant effect on systolic blood viscosity when com-
pared with CON. When the analysis was repeated with
the interaction of treatment-effect-by-time included as a
variable in the mixed model, the treatment effect was
still significant for systolic blood viscosity (p = 0.02) in
favor
of
ALK;
however,
the
interaction
effect
of
treatment-arm-by-time-point for systolic blood viscosity
was not itself significant.
Discussion
This randomized, double-blinded, parallel-arm controlled
study compared the rehydration effect of ALK to CON in
order to characterize relative hydration efficacy and per-
formance. A pre-planned analysis of percentage changes,
starting at dehydration (T000) and ending at recovery
(T120), enabled the two treatment groups to be compared
while reducing the impact of inter-individual variability.
For systolic blood viscosity, ALK demonstrated signifi-
cantly greater rehydration than CON (p = 0.03), and this
result was consistent with the findings using the mixed
model analyses.
Interest in the study of biomarkers for hydration has in-
tensified in recent years, however the relative utility of
markers is dependent on the environment and the nature
of the stimuli applied in a given study. Even in studies of
responses to acute exercise-induced dehydration, a gold
standard biomarker for hydration status has proved elu-
sive [13–15]. Viscosity was used as the primary endpoint
in this study to reflect intravascular hydration and was
clearly affected by exercise-induced dehydration. Several
prior studies have reported increases in blood viscosity fol-
lowing exercise [16, 17]. In a study of 20 healthy adults,
blood viscosity was reported to increase after 15 min of
submaximal exercise [18]. In a prior clinical study of 47
endurance-trained and untrained females, mean viscosity
levels after 1 h of maximal exercise were reported to be
12.6% higher, a greater magnitude increase than could be
attributed to hematocrit, which rose by a mean of 8.9%
[19]. Blood viscosity is not static but changes dramatically
depending on shear rate. Shear rate is calculated by divid-
ing flow velocity by lumen diameter. When blood moves
quickly at the peak of systole, it is at high-shear and rela-
tively thinner because erythrocytes are dispersed. At high
shear rates, systolic viscosity is influenced by hematocrit
levels and red cell deformability, whereas at low shear
rates, diastolic viscosity is influenced by red cell aggrega-
tion [20]. For this reason, systolic blood viscosity may be
able to provide a more direct marker of hydration status
than diastolic blood viscosity.
The key difference between electrolyzed, high-pH ALK
and standard drinking water purified by reverse osmosis,
used as the CON in this study is the degree of alkalinity.
In a study of 1136 Japanese females, Murakami et al.

 waist circumference [21]. These researchers suggested
that unfavorable metabolic cardiac risk factors may be
induced by mild metabolic acidosis which increased cor-
tisol production. Heil reported significantly increased
blood pH secondary to consumption of mineral-rich
ALK [22]. Separately, Heil et al. demonstrated faster and
better overall hydration with ALK than CON (bottled)
in ten male cyclists. Hydration markers reported therein
were urine specific gravity, urine output, serum protein
concentration, and water retention [23]. In both of these
studies, the effects took at least one week to occur after
habitual intake of alkaline water. While Heil et al. did not
perform mechanistic studies, they hypothesized that blood
alkalinity was shifted as a result of direct absorption of al-
kaline minerals into the blood and that water retention
within the vasculature was improved by the absorption of
additional minerals into the blood [22]. In a more recent
study by the same group, it was suggested that increases

 in extracellular pH may influence blood flow indirectly by
altering interstitial potassium concentrations [24].
Separately, a study using an exercise-induced dehydra-
tion protocol to compare the effect of two fluid replace-
ment beverages on markers for oxidative stress showed
that rehydration recovery following ingestion of either a
carbohydrate-electrolyte beverage or water reduced levels
of malondialdehyde, a common marker for oxidative stress,
relative to plasma concentrations of malondialdehyde at a
dehydrated state [25]. Disruptions in blood flow promote
an oxidative state where reactive oxygen species accu-
mulate. Red blood cells in particular are vulnerable to an
oxidative environment in the human body and, as a conse-
quence of their iron content, are capable of producing their
own free radicals [26]. This process of autoxidation occurs
when oxygenated hemoglobin is degraded and releases a
superoxide. Concurrently, the ferrous (Fe2+) state iron in
hemoglobin is oxidized to ferric (Fe3+) hemoglobin, produ-
cing methemoglobin which is incapable of transporting
oxygen [27]. Peroxides in the body degrade hemoglobin
proteins and cause erythrocytes to release heme and iron.
Forces required for red cells to perfuse capillaries can cause
cell membranes to leak ions, causing further damage to
lipid membranes [28]. When reactive oxygen species
initiate peroxidation of lipid membranes, cellular mem-
brane proteins often become cross-linked and red cells be-
come stiffer with less deformability [27]. Production of
methemoglobin, modification and degradation of proteins,
cross-linking of membrane proteins, lipid peroxidation,
hemoglobin cross-linking, and impaired surface properties
are all mechanisms by which oxidative stress functionally
modifies red blood cells [26]. These mechanisms alter red

 cell properties, including reduced membrane fluidity and
increased aggregation, leading to increased blood viscosity
and impaired flow [29].
A separate study of 154 subjects with varying stages of
diabetes mellitus and healthy controls showed that more
than 76% of oxidative stress in apparently healthy subjects
was associated with elevated WBV, with 95% prevalence
in the prediabetes group and 92% prevalence in the
diabetes group [30]. This clinical study measured markers
of erythrocyte oxidative stress included erythrocyte gluta-
thione, methemoglobin, and malondialdehyde. Associa-
tions between oxidative stress of red blood cells and
altered blood viscosity in healthy subjects, as well as those
with diabetes and prediabetic patients, suggest that blood
viscosity may be a marker for underlying oxidative stress.
We speculate that differences in systolic viscosity levels
caused by ALK vs. CON following dehydration may have
been mediated by the influence of reactive oxygen species
on erythrocyte membranes and their deformability. Further
studies are needed to determine if high-pH ALK is directly
associated to reductions in oxidative stress. With respect to
plasma osmolality as a hydration marker, Armstrong in his
authoritative review noted that “a single gold standard,
including plasma osmolality, is not possible for all hydra-
tion assessment requirements” [15]. He stated body mass
change is the most accurate assessment of hydration in real
time, and his review of biomarkers, which did not include
blood viscosity, suggested that the accuracy of most hydra-
tion markers is not consistently supported. Body mass
changes reflect body water losses and gains secondary to
sweating and water intake, respectively. Consequently,
changes in mass are very frequently measured in exercise
studies and serve as a benchmark for other hydration
markers. Although plasma osmolality is considered among
the best available indices by many researchers, none of the
analyses performed in this study showed significant differ-
ences between ALK and CON on this marker. Plasma
osmolality does not incorporate the influence of cellular
content in the blood and is difficult to assess when total
body water, fluid intake, and fluid loss are altered.
Bioelectrical impedance analysis has been widely used to
assess hydration status. This tool allows for the determin-
ation of water volumes throughout various fluid compart-
ments of the body. There were no treatment arm effects
when comparing ALK with CON on any of the bioimpe-
dance indices in our study. It is possible that acute dehydra-
tion and rehydration consistent within this present study (2%
body mass) failed to accurately predict changes in body water
that were otherwise able to be determined by assessing body
mass changes. Further, in athletes with low baseline body fat,
small body water changes may be mistakenly reported as
body fat changes by bioimpedance testing [31]. Changes in
extracellular volume and osmolality may also impair the
accuracy of bioelectrical impedance assessments [32].
Conclusion
This study was designed to characterize differences between
ALK and CON in terms of intravascular hydration as
quantified by serial changes in systolic blood viscosity follow-
ing exercise-induced dehydration. Drinking high-pH ALK
was shown to reduce systolic blood viscosity significantly
more than CON consumption following exercise-induced
dehydration, when comparing the percent change in WBV
from a dehydrated state to 120 min after rehydration and re-
covery. A mixed model analyses validated this significant
treatment effect for high-pH ALK on systolic blood viscosity
vs. CON. Absolute differences at multiple time points did
not demonstrate any significant differences; however the
subjective observed benefit may be attributed to the high
variability of WBV measurements in the study groups.
