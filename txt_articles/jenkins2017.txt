ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND Dietary recommendations emphasize increased consumption of fruit, vegetables, and whole grain
cereals for prevention of chronic disease.
OBJECTIVES This study assessed the effect of dietary advice and/or food provision on body weight and cardiovascular
disease risk factors.
METHODS Healthy overweight men (n ¼ 209) and women (n ¼ 710), mean age 44.7 years, body mass index [BMI]
32.4 kg/m2, were randomized between November 2005 and August 2009 to receive Health Canada’s food guide (control,
n ¼ 486) or 1 of 3 interventions: dietary advice consistent with both Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) and
dietary portfolio principles (n ¼ 145); weekly food provision reflecting this advice (n ¼ 148); or food delivery plus advice
(n ¼ 140). Interventions lasted 6 months with 12-month follow-up. Semiquantitative food frequency questionnaires and
fasting blood, anthropometric and blood pressure measurements were obtained at baseline, 6 months, and 18 months.
RESULTS Participant retention at 6 and 18 months was 91% and 81%, respectively, after food provision compared to
67% and 57% when no food was provided (p < 0.0001). Test and control treatments showed small reductions in
body weight (�0.8 to �1.2 kg), waist circumference (�1.1 to �1.9 cm), and mean arterial pressure (0.0 to �1.1 mm Hg) at
6 months and Framingham coronary heart disease risk score at 18 months (�0.19 to �0.42%), which were significant
overall. Outcomes did not differ among test and control groups.
CONCLUSIONS Provision of foods increased retention but only modestly increased intake of recommended foods.
Current dietary recommendations showed small overall benefits in coronary heart disease risk factors. Additional dietary
strategies to maximize these benefits are required. (Fruits, Vegetables, and Whole Grains: A Community-based

 D
ata from major cohort studies sug-
gest that 82% of cardiovascular
disease and 91% of diabetes risk
may be prevented by changes in diet and
lifestyle (1,2). To address the growing burden
of chronic disease, dietary guidelines for the
general public, including the Dietary Refer-
ence Intakes for the United States and Can-
ada, focus on chronic disease reduction in addition
to simple nutritional adequacy. The most recent sci-
entific recommendations of the U.S. Dietary Guide-
lines Advisory committee now advocate 3 dietary
patterns to prevent chronic disease: the healthy
American diet, the Mediterranean diet, and for the
first time, a vegetarian diet (3). All of these dietary
patterns incorporate traditional advice to eat more
fruit, vegetables, and whole grain cereals, plus more
recent advice to eat more cholesterol-lowering “func-
tional” foods such as oats, barley, nuts, and plant pro-
tein foods (e.g., soy and other legumes). This dietary
approach fits with the recent report of the workshop
convened by the World Heart Federation (4). Thera-
peutic diets such as the Dietary Approaches to Stop
Hypertension (DASH) recommended in the AHA/ACC
guidelines (5) and the dietary portfolio recommended
in the Canadian Cardiovascular Society guidelines (6)
to lower cholesterol also emphasize these principles
and consistently result in large reductions in blood
pressure and lipids when taken under metabolically
controlled conditions (7–9). Yet despite efforts to
encourage the general public to increase plant food
consumption, the response has been slow (10).
We determined whether we could increase adher-
ence to the DASH-type and dietary portfolio eating
patterns and improve health outcomes by providing
both
advice
and
food
to
healthy
overweight
individuals.
METHODS
PARTICIPANTS. Participants were residents of the
city of Toronto, 18 years or older, English speaking, and
had body mass index (BMI) >25 kg/m2. Individuals or
families were recruited if at least 1 family member had
BMI >25 kg/m2, and blood pressure and thyroid medi-
cations (thyroxin) dosages, if taken, were stable for at
least 1 month prior to starting the study. Exclusion
criteria included pregnancy or breastfeeding; actively
following a special diet or weight-loss program; major
surgery or a cardiovascular event in the previous 6
months; diabetes, liver disease, renal failure, cancer
(except nonmelanoma skin cancer), inflammatory
bowel disease or major chronic inflammatory diseases;

mm Hg on more than one occasion.
PROTOCOL. Eligible participants recruited by adver-
tisements between October 2005 and July 2009 were
sent
questionnaires
including
a
semiquantitative
food frequency questionnaire (11). Completed ques-
tionnaires, fasting blood, anthropometric, and blood
pressure measurements were obtained at baseline
and at subsequent clinic attendances at 6 and 18
months at St. Michael’s Hospital, a University of
Toronto Teaching Hospital. Research Ethics boards of
the University of Toronto and St. Michael’s Hospital
approved
the
protocol.
All
participants
provided
signed
consent.
The
trial
was
registered
with
ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00516620).
DIETARY INTERVENTIONS. All participants received
a copy of Health Canada’s Food Guide. No further
advice was given to the control group. The first
treatment group received additional dietary advice
weekly for the first month and monthly for the
following 5 months as 20- to 30-min telephone in-
terviews with individual participants or the families’
primary shopper or cook. The advice addressed ben-
efits, strategies for change, and barriers to change for
each participating family member. Participants were
encouraged to increase intake of fruit, vegetables,
whole grain cereals, to reduce meat and sweets, and
to
increase
consumption
of
cholesterol-lowering
functional
foods
including
soy
foods,
nuts,
and
viscous fiber sources such as oats and barley. A sec-
ond treatment group received a weekly food basket
(Food Share, Toronto, Ontario) for 6 months, reflect-
ing the advice given to the first treatment group but
did not receive dietary advice. A third treatment
group received both the weekly food basket and di-
etary advice. All members of the same family were
expected to follow the same treatment. Exercise
patterns were recorded but no additional advice was
given (Figure 1). The effect of advice to avoid sugar-
sweetened
beverages
was
also
assessed
using
a
factorial design with the addition of a treatment
group that involved sugar sweetened beverage advice
alone. The effect of sugar-sweetened beverage advice
will be reported separately.
BIOCHEMICAL AND DIETARY ANALYSES. Biochem-
ical analyses were performed in the St. Michael’s
Hospital (Toronto) routine laboratory. Participants’
body weight was measured without shoes in light
indoor clothing on the same beam balance at each
clinic visit. Blood pressure was the mean of 3 readings
using an automatic sphygmomanometer (Omron HEM
907 XL, Omron Healthcare Inc., Burlington, Ontario,
Canada).
The
original
validated
semiquantitative
food frequency questionnaire of Willett et al. (11) was
expanded to 184 food items to better capture whole
grains and viscous fiber products, including oats and
barley. Questionnaires were processed in the Nutri-
tion Department, Harvard School of Public Health.
SAMPLE SIZE. The power calculation was based on
households,
and
randomization
was
planned
to
assess dietary change. Sample size was calculated
using Student’s t-test for independent observations
that required 360 controls, 120 for dietary advice,
120 for food delivery, and 120 for food delivery and
dietary advice (Online Methods 1).
RANDOMIZATION. Randomization
took
place
be-
tween November 2005 and August 2009 to control or
1 of the 3 dietary treatment groups to achieve an
approximately 3:1:1:1 ratio for the control and the 3
dietary interventions, respectively. Participants were
randomized as households (assuming an average of 2
family members per household), and all members of
the same household received the same treatment. A
statistician not involved in the day-to-day operation
of the interventions created blocks of random as-
signments (n ¼ 39). Assignments were sealed in or-
dered, numbered, opaque envelopes. Upon consent
and eligibility confirmation for the individual or
household, the coordinator opened each envelope in
sequence and assigned the participant to the treat-
ment group it contained. To allow for assessment of
the effect of advice to reduce consumption of sugar-
sweetened beverages (to be reported separately), a
factorial design was used with the addition of an ex-
tra cell of 60 households given only this advice. Their
data are reported as part of the control group in the
present study.
STATISTICS. Means and 95% confidence intervals
(CIs) are provided. Body weight change was the pri-
mary outcome. To model change, the dependent
variable was the end-of-study value with treatment
(categorical) and the baseline value as independent
variables in a mixed model ANCOVA (PROC MIXED),
SAS version 9.4 software (Cary, North Carolina). A
Tukey correction was applied for multiple compari-
sons where significance was found. We used an ITT
(intention-to-treat) analysis that accounted for drop
outs using multiple imputation (5 sets) and a mono-
tone predictive mean matching method (PROC MI)
modeled with visit, age, sex, baseline weight and
height,
smoking
status,
income,
education,
and
baseline outcome as covariates (Online Methods 2
and 3). Results from the 5 imputations were pooled
using PROC MIANALYZE. To address correlated ob-
servations within families, we added a random effect

 term to the statistical model to account for family
unit. Framingham coronary heart disease (CHD) risk
scores were calculated (12) using participants’ age at
baseline. Dietary data were analyzed using ANCOVA,
using all available data. Two further assessments of
the data were also undertaken. First to assess the
outcomes using household as the unit of analysis, the
mean values of each household were taken and sec-
ondly those participants whose BMI was <25 kg/m2
(n ¼ 36) were removed from the analysis, and again
the data were reanalyzed.
RESULTS
SIX-MONTH OUTCOMES. A total of 919 participants
were randomized (209 men, 710 women; mean age:
44.7 years, and BMI: 32.4 kg/m2) (Online Table 1).
A total of 722 were randomized as single-member
households, 94 as 2-member households (n ¼ 188),
and 3 as 3-member households (n ¼ 9). A total of
685 participants completed 6 months (170 men, 515
women), equating to a 75% retention rate (Figure 1).
When “food provided” was compared to “no food
provided,” a major difference was seen in retention
favoring food provision, with 91% retention for those
with food provision versus 67% (p < 0.0001) for
those without food provision completing the 6-month
active intervention.
SIX-MONTH CHANGE IN DIETARY INTAKE. At 6 months,
only small increases were seen in intake of fruit (0.3 to
1.1 servings/day), vegetables (0.4 to 1.3 servings/day),
and whole grains (0.0 to 1.0 servings/day) (Figure 2,
Online Table 2). The increases in intake in the treat-
ment groups compared to the control were even
smaller, with only food provision plus advice showing
consistent increases in fruit, vegetables, and whole
grain cereals (Online Table 3). The differences were
0.8, 0.9, and 0.9 servings/day, respectively, for the 3
treatments (Figure 2). Other treatment differences,
where they occurred, were small (Online Table 3).

 The same pattern of very small increases was seen
with the so-called functional, cholesterol-lowering,
foods (nuts, viscous fiber, and soy protein foods).
Thus the maximum increase in nut intake was only
6.5 g/day (under one-quarter of an ounce) following
food delivery plus advice (Online Table 2).
SIX-MONTH OUTCOMES: BODY WEIGHT AND CHD
RISK FACTORS. Overall, at 6 months, the cohort
showed small reductions in body weight (�1.0 kg),
waist circumference (�1.4 cm), and blood pressure
(diastolic:
�0.8
mm
Hg
and
mean
arterial
pressure: �0.7 mm Hg) (Table 1). Similar reductions
were seen on the control and individual test treat-
ments for body weight (�0.8 to �1.2 kg), waist
circumference (�1.1 to �1.9 cm), and blood pressure
(diastolic: �0.1 to �1.0 mm Hg, and mean arterial
pressure: 0.0 to �1.1 mm Hg) (Table 2). The within
treatment
differences
in
body
weight
and
waist
circumference were significant for the control and
test treatments (Central Illustration).
The only other significant reductions were for both
diastolic blood pressure and mean arterial blood
pressure on control (�1.0 mm Hg, p ¼ 0.002, and �0.9
mm Hg, p ¼ 0.042, respectively) (Table 2). However,
there were no significant treatment differences for any
of the outcome measurements between any of the
4 groups (control and 3 treatments) (Online Table 4).
DIFFERENCES
AND
“LEGACY
EFFECTS”
AT
18
MONTHS. At 18 months, the overall retention was
65%, including 81% for those provided with food and
57% for those without food provision. Only small in-
creases from baseline remained for fruit (0.4 to 0.6
servings/day), vegetables (0.3 to 0.6 servings/day),
and whole grain cereals (0 to 0.6 servings/day). These
increases were significantly reduced from the already
modest 6-month increases (Online Figure 1, Online
Table
5).
The
same
pattern
was
seen
with
the
cholesterol-lowering functional foods, for example,
for nuts, the increase was reduced at 18 months to
between 3.3 and 4.7 g/day on the test treatments,
and
when
compared
to
the
control
increase
of
3.6
g/day,
these
differences
became
negligible
(�0.8 to 1.3 g/day) (Online Table 3).
For the whole cohort, the reductions in body
weight, BMI and waist circumference that were seen
at 6 months were maintained (Online Table 6). High-
density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) rose between
6 and 18 months (0.05 mmol/l, p < 0.0001) and the
total-to-HDL-C ratio was reduced. Reduction in blood
pressure at 6 months was further reduced signifi-
cantly between 6 and 18 months, with the reductions
in the Framingham CHD risk score becoming signifi-
cant at 18 months (Online Table 6). These differences
were also reflected in the individual treatment re-
sponses (Online Figure 2), with no significant treat-
ment
differences
either
between
the
18-month
changes from baseline or between the 6 to 18 months
differences (Online Tables 4 and 7).
ADDITIONAL ANALYSES. No outcome differences at
6 and 18 months were uncovered by assessing the
data by using household as the unit of analysis or by
eliminating those family members who had body
weights in the normal range (Online Tables 8 and 9).
ADVERSE EVENTS. There were 24 serious adverse
events according to the Code of Federal Regulations
(13) (7 control, 11 food basket and dietary advice,
4 food basket only, and 2 dietary advice only) (Online
Table 10). After adjustment for length of participant
time in the study the difference between the pooled
test and control treatments failed to reach signifi-
cance (p ¼ 0.068). However, separate assessment of
gastrointestinal-related events indicated significantly
more
events
among
test
participants
than
control
participants:
7
versus
0.
Adverse
events
were cholecystectomy (n ¼ 3), appendectomy (n ¼ 2),
hiatal hernia repair (n ¼ 1), and diverticulitis (n ¼ 1),
p ¼ 0.005 (Online Table 10).
DISCUSSION
These data demonstrate the difficulty in effectively
promoting fruit, vegetable, and whole grain cereals to

 the general population, using recommendations that,
when followed, decrease risk factors for chronic dis-
ease (Central Illustration). They indicate an urgent
need
for
innovative
approaches
to
support
the
implementation of current dietary advice (5,6,14,15).
Our findings are supported by a meta-analysis of
smaller
shorter
studies,
beginning
in
1998,
that
showed no change in body weight compared to the
control treatment even when fruit and vegetables
were provided (16,17). However our results contrast
with trials in participants at higher risk (8). One trial of
345 participants with hypercholesterolemia, many of
whom had been given a statin “holiday,” showed low-
density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reductions of
13% to 14% with corresponding 41% to 46% adherence
to a dietary portfolio of cholesterol-lowering foods (8),
as opposed to only 12% adherence in the present
study. In this respect, a very recent large (543 partici-
pants)
comprehensive
lifestyle
peer
group-based
intervention on cardiovascular risk factors also found
no
significant
effect
on
individual
risk
factors,
although due to a major success in smoking cessation,
a reduction in estimated cardiovascular risk was ach-
ieved (18). In that trial 31% of participants smoked
compared to 7.8% in the current study. Smoking
cessation, exercise, and stress management were not
part of our purely dietary intervention.
ADVERSE EVENTS. Those given advice plus the food
basket suffered an excess of gastrointestinal side ef-
fects.
Although
the
diets
prescribed
are
recom-
mended for long-term gastrointestinal health, it is
possible that the acute increase in fiber from cereals,
fruits,
and
vegetables
may
have
caused
some
abdominal discomfort and drawn attention to pre-
existing
conditions. The
increase
in fiber
intake
compared to the control at 6 months was 8.2 g/day
extra for a 2,000 kcal diet. This fiber intake was
equivalent to 4 slices of whole wheat bread daily.
However,
these
participants
were
already
accus-
tomed
to
a
reasonable
fiber
intake
at
baseline
(25.4 g/day), and problems were not anticipated
with higher fiber diets.
FACTORS FAVORING LIFESTYLE CHANGE. The suc-
cess of dietary advice may be influenced by the
perception of immediate benefit from the interven-
tion. Further emphasis is therefore required on the
longer term health advantages of sustaining a good
diet
for
otherwise
healthy
people,
as
has
been
demonstrated
in
cohort
studies
with
long-term
follow-up (19,20). Usual diets may also represent
stable “habits” that are resistant to change without
specific personal and environmental supports (21).
Thus more emphasis should be placed on overcoming
barriers related to methods of food preparation and in
illustrating those situations in which the desired
foods can be eaten (meals and snacks). Addressing
these issues in cafeteria trials where entire meals
were fed to healthy people addressed the issue of diet
adherence and demonstrated that lower body weight
and blood lipids can be achieved in the long term (22).
Consumption
of
nuts
has
increased considerably
since the repeated demonstration of their cholesterol-
lowering potential, their possible CHD risk reduction
properties in cohort studies, and recently, in a ran-
domized controlled trial (23–25). However this secular
trend did not increase our success in promoting

 population? In the present study, provision of foods
very significantly increased retention. Although this
approach only resulted in modest increases in con-
sumption of recommended foods or reductions in
study outcomes, retention itself may be an indication
of continued adherence.
Finally, should the ecological sustainability ad-
vantages of increased plant food consumption be
emphasized?
Sustainability
considerations
are
increasingly alluded to in current dietary guide-
lines and science advisory reports internationally
(3,26), and may increase the appeal to younger and
healthier people, similar to our participants.
ADHERENCE
IN
THE
PRESENT
STUDY. Using
the
above ideas, adherence in our study might have
been improved if our participants had had compel-
ling
reasons
to
change
their
dietary
habits,
including raised LDL-C or elevated blood pressure
(baseline LDL-C: 3.23 mmol/l, and blood pressure:
115/73 mm Hg in the present study). Furthermore,
provision of complete diets or use of workplace
cafeteria to provide meals incorporating DASH and
portfolio dietary principles, plus a comprehensive
educational program on the value of food in the
maintenance of good health, might also have been
helpful.
STUDY LIMITATIONS. A significant limitation of the
study was the differential dropout rate between the
treatment arms, with a 6-month retention of 91% in
the 2 food delivery arms versus 67% when no food
was provided. Similar effects of food provision have
been seen in longer diet trials such as the PREDIMED
trial where provision of nuts or olive oil was associ-
ated with enhanced retention (23), and high retention
rates commonly observed in drug trials may relate in
part to the free provision of the intervention. It is
interesting that in our study there also appeared to be
a “legacy effect” in that when no food was provided,
prior provision of food still resulted at 18 months in
an 81% retention versus 57% where no food had been
provided.
A second limitation was the provision of Canada’s
Food Guide, which may have had beneficial effects
in increasing intake of the desired foods in the
control group; however, the changes observed were
small. Furthermore, we did not recruit sufficient
family members to allow the assessment of family
influences on dietary change. Third, as the partici-
pants were generally healthy at baseline, with 18%
of participants who belonged to 2- or 3-member
family units already at a healthy body weight (4% of
total group), changes in risk factors may have been
more difficult to detect and so limited our ability to
see an effect.
STRENGTHS. One strength of our study is that it is
the first to encourage specific food consumption by
providing both dietary advice and a range of foods
that included less familiar functional foods. It is
also the first to do so in the context of DASH and
portfolio
dietary
approaches,
and
determine
the
effects on body weight and risk factors for CHD. In
addition it demonstrated that removal of certain
potential barriers to consumption including avail-
ability
and
familiarity
(e.g.,
soy
products)
was
not enough to increase substantially the use of
desired foods in overweight but otherwise healthy
people.
CONCLUSIONS
Increasing the intake of not only fruit, vegetables,
and whole grain cereals but also functional foods
proved difficult (27), even when these foods were
provided weekly and despite the known effectiveness
of such foods in managing CHD risk factors. Healthy
shifts in diet among generally well populations is
likely to require a range of sustained approaches and
multiple
forms
of
communication
in
a
process
measured in decades rather than months (10).

PERSPECTIVES
COMPETENCY IN SYSTEMS-BASED PRACTICE: Although
fruit, vegetables, and whole grain cereals are part of dietary
advice given internationally, foods containing soy protein, nuts,
viscous fiber sources (oats, barley, psyllium), and plant sterols
(e.g., as in enriched margarine) have been approved by the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration for heart health claims since they
specifically lower serum cholesterol.
TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Dietary change is difficult in
relatively healthy populations and may take community-based
strategies to implement effectively, but even limited patient
instructions, including pamphlets and guidelines from national
public health agencies may lead to reductions in body weight and
coronary heart disease risk scores.
