Abstract
Alongside its immediate implications for pregnancy complications, increasing evidence implicates 
maternal obesity as a major determinant of health in the offspring during childhood and later adult 
life. Observational studies provide evidence for effects of maternal obesity on the offspring’s risks 
of obesity, coronary heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes and asthma. Maternal obesity may also 
lead to poorer cognitive performance in the offspring and an increased risk of neurodevelopmental 
disorders including cerebral palsy. Preliminary evidence suggests potential implications for 
immune and infectious disease related outcomes. Insights from experimental studies support 
causal effects of maternal obesity on offspring outcomes, mediated at least in part through changes 
in epigenetic processes including alternations in DNA methylation, and perhaps through 
alterations in the gut microbiome. Although the offspring of obese women who lose weight prior

 to pregnancy have a reduced risk of obesity, to date few controlled intervention studies have 
reversed maternal obesity and examined the consequences for the offspring. The long term effects 
of maternal obesity may have profound public health implications and indicate the urgency of 
studies on causality, underlying mechanisms and effective interventions to reverse the epidemic of 
obesity in women of child-bearing age and to mitigate its consequences for the offspring.
Introduction
Maternal obesity is widely recognised for its immediate implications in terms of pregnancy 
complications, including gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia and delivery of large-for-
gestational infants.1 More recently the recognition that developmental influences can have 
long term consequences on offspring health and wellbeing has focused attention on the 
potential for maternal obesity to be one of the influences contributing to the “developmental 
origins of health and disease”.2 The high prevalence of maternal obesity associated with the 
global obesity epidemic dictates that determination of any such long-term effects is now an 
urgent priority.3
While control for potentially confounding variables remains a challenge in human 
observational studies, an extensive experimental literature in rodents and non-human 
primates has demonstrated that maternal obesity induced by dietary intervention leads to 
obesity, diabetes, raised blood pressure, fatty liver and behaviour changes in the offspring.4 
Maternal obesity has been shown to permanently alter a variety of metabolic control 
processes in the fetus, including the hypothalamic response to leptin and subsequent 
regulation of appetite and pancreatic beta cell physiology.4 Mechanisms are likely 
multifactorial but potentially include maternal metabolic changes such as changes in glucose 
and fatty acids,5 altered maternal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity6 and changes 
in placental function and inflammation.7
In this Series paper, we review the evidence linking maternal obesity with long-term 
offspring consequences, focusing on body composition, cardiometabolic, allergic, immune/
infectious and neuro-behavioural outcomes and discuss altered epigenetic processes as a 
likely major mechanism underlying long-term effects of maternal obesity on the offspring.
Body composition and cardiometabolic outcomes
An accumulating body of evidence suggests that maternal pre-pregnancy obesity and 
excessive gestational weight gain are associated with an increased risk of obesity in the 
offspring during childhood.8–11 While the initial focus was on extreme categories of 
maternal obesity, several recent studies suggest that higher maternal pre-pregnancy body 
mass index (BMI) across the full spectrum is associated with greater childhood adiposity 
and an adverse body fat distribution.12–15 Higher gestational weight gain is also associated 
with a higher childhood BMI and greater fat mass estimated by dual-energy X-ray 
absorptiometry.15–20 Whilst both maternal pre-pregnancy obesity and excessive gestational 
weight gain seem to be associated with a higher blood pressure, adverse lipid profile, and 
insulin resistance in childhood,12,16,20,21 there is some evidence that these associations are 
largely mediated by childhood BMI.12,16

 Alongside studies focused on outcomes in children, multiple studies have suggested that a 
higher maternal pre-pregnancy BMI and greater gestational weight gain are associated with 
a higher BMI in adolescents and adults.22–29 A study of 2,432 Australians found that 
greater maternal gestational weight gain was associated with a higher BMI (on average 0.3 
kg/m2 (95% CI 0.1-0.4 kg/m2) higher for each 0.1 kg/week greater gestational weight gain) 
in the offspring at the age 21 years.29 These associations were independent of maternal pre-
pregnancy BMI. Similarly, a study among 1400 mother-offspring pairs in Jerusalem showed 
that higher maternal pre-pregnancy BMI was associated with higher offspring BMI at age 30 
years (an increase of 1.8kg/m2 in offspring BMI per increase of one standard deviation in 
maternal pre-pregnancy BMI).23 In this study the associations of maternal pre-pregnancy 
BMI with cardiovascular risk were fully explained by adult BMI.23 Findings from the 
Helsinki Birth Cohort Study (HBCS) suggest that maternal BMI is positively associated with 
offspring BMI at age 60 years.30,31 A higher maternal BMI was also associated with a less 
favourable body fat distribution in female offspring at a mean age of 62 years.31 Similarly to 
the studies in children, no consistent associations of maternal BMI with other cardiovascular 
risk factors were present among adults. Inconsistencies may be due to study design and 
availability of measurements and confounding factors.
Findings from registration/register-based and retrospective cohort studies in Helsinki 
implicate maternal obesity in pregnancy as an important determinant of the risk of 
cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in the offspring. A further study using birth records 
from 37,709 individuals in the UK showed that a higher maternal BMI was associated with 
an increased risk of premature all-cause mortality (hazard ratio HR 1.35, 95% CI 1.17-1.55) 
and hospital admissions for cardiovascular events in adult offspring (HR 1.29, 95% CI 
1.06-1.57).32 These associations were independent of socioeconomic status and current age. 
In line with these findings, similar findings have been reported in the Helsinki Birth Cohort 
Study participants born 1934–44 and followed up between the years 1971 to 2010.33 
Cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes and stroke were all more 
common among offspring of obese mothers. For cardiovascular disease, findings were 
similar for males and females, while for type 2 diabetes the association was stronger in 
women. The association of maternal BMI with offspring coronary heart disease was 
statistically significant among males only (trend per kg/m2 HR 1.031, 95% CI 1.009-1.054), 
whereas the association of maternal BMI with stroke was significant among females only 
(trend per kg/m2 HR 1.059, 95% CI 1.019-1.101).33
Several studies have aimed to identify critical periods of maternal weight during pregnancy 
for childhood outcomes. A study performed among 5,000 UK mother-offspring pairs 
showed that gestational weight gain in the first 14 weeks of pregnancy was positively 
associated with offspring adiposity at 9 years of age.17 Likewise a study among 6,000 Dutch 
mother-offspring dyads showed that early-pregnancy weight gain was associated with an 
adverse cardio-metabolic profile (OR 1.20 95% CI 1.07- 1.35) in childhood16 and that this 
finding was independent of maternal weight gain before pregnancy and of weight gain in 
later pregnancy. These studies suggest that maternal weight gain in early pregnancy, when 
maternal fat accumulation forms a relatively large component of gestational weight gain,34 
may be a critical period for an adverse childhood cardiovascular risk profile.

 Thus, maternal pre-pregnancy obesity and gestational weight gain, especially in early 
pregnancy, may influence the risks of adiposity and adverse cardiovascular risk from 
childhood to adulthood.
Allergic and atopic outcomes
The global rise in maternal obesity has been implicated in the parallel rising burden of 
asthma, allergic disease and other early immune diseases, with speculation that this may be 
part of the multisystem consequences of obesity-related inflammation for the offspring. 
Indeed, a recent meta-analysis that included 14 studies and 108,321 mother-child pairs found 
that maternal overweight or obesity in pregnancy were associated with increased risks of 
childhood asthma or wheeze ever (OR 1.31, 95%CI 1.16-1.49) and current asthma or 
wheeze (OR 1.21; 95%CI, 1.07-1.37), independent of offspring BMI.35 Higher maternal 
gestational weight gain was also associated with higher offspring odds of current asthma or 
wheeze (OR 1.015 per 1 kg increase, 95% CI 1.01–1.02) but not associated with asthma or 
wheeze ever (OR = 1.04 per kg, 95% CI 0.97–1.11). Follow up of the Danish National Birth 
Cohort found that the impact of maternal obesity was largely limited to asthma and 
wheezing, and did not increase the risk of eczema, sensitisation (largely assessed to 
aeroallergens) or hay fever,36 suggesting tissue specific effects. This is consistent with 
evidence that allergic diseases result from both systemic immune dysregulation and tissue-
specific effects during critical stages of development.
Whilst pathways linking maternal obesity to offspring allergic and atopic outcomes are 
multifactorial, the contribution of reduced microbial diversity, and in particular intestinal 
dysbiosis, has emerged as a central risk factor. Changing microbial exposure has been long 
implicated in the dramatic increase in early-onset inflammatory non-communicable disease 
such as allergy and asthma, but the importance of these complex microbiological ecosystems 
is becoming increasingly apparent in the physiological, immunological, and metabolic 
dysregulation seen in obesity.37 Emerging evidence suggests the multisystem influences of 
declining microbial diversity also begin in utero, including through epigenetic influences.38
Thus, an aberrant gut microbiome, known to be associated with maternal obesity, provides 
an additional mechanism for both the immune and metabolic consequences on the 
developing fetus.39 There is preliminary evidence in humans that dietary manipulation of 
the maternal microbiome in pregnancy with prebiotic fibre has beneficial effects for both 
offspring immune function and metabolism (reviewed in [40]). In animal models this can 
prevent the development of an allergic asthma phenotype in the offspring – an effect directly 
mediated by the short chain fatty acid (SCFA) metabolites produced by microbial 
fermentation of dietary fibre.41 In addition to their effects on metabolism, glucose 
homeostasis and appetite regulation, SCFA also have powerful anti-inflammatory effects – 
both in local tissues and systemically through regulatory T cell induction.40,41 Notably, this 
includes tissue-specific effects in the lung. Moreover, there is preliminary evidence in 
humans that high SCFA (acetate) levels in pregnancy correlates with fewer doctor visits for 
cough and wheeze in their offspring.41 This provides a novel perspective on how a Western-
style fast food diet associated with obesity might increase asthma risk, whereas a 
Mediterranean diet (high in fish, fruits, nuts and vegetables) might be protective against

 wheeze and asthma in childhood42; such an effect could be mediated, at least in part, 
through the microbiome and its metabolic effects on immune responses and tissue function.
Collectively these observations underscore the complex interplay between evolving 
metabolic and immune responses and how these may be modified by maternal nutrition, 
adiposity and microbial diversity to alter susceptibility to inflammatory diseases across the 
lifecourse.43
Other immune and infectious disease related outcomes
Whether maternal obesity increases offspring susceptibility to other immune and infectious 
disease related outcomes has been less well studied, but is important to consider given the 
rising increases in obesity in low- and middle-income countries44 where the burden of 
infection during pregnancy and in childhood is high. With dampened maternal immunity to 
tolerate the semi-allogenic offspring, pregnancy represents a period of increased 
susceptibility to infection, and maternal obesity further increases this risk.45 Studies in 
rodent models of maternal obesity demonstrate worse offspring outcomes in response to 
bacterial infection and experimentally induced autoimmunity.46,47
In humans, maternal obesity also impacts the maturation and development of the newborn 
immune system, with adverse influences on the frequency and function of key innate and 
adaptive immune cells measured in umbilical cord blood.48 Infants born in developed 
countries also have different proportions of circulating immune cells and innate immune 
responses compared to those born in developing countries, but at present little is known 
about the contributions of maternal nutritional state vs. other exposures (e.g. infections) to 
these differences.49 The difference may, however, have important effects on susceptibility to 
pathogens, responses to vaccines, and development of immunopathological disorders such as 
asthma and allergy.50 Obesity is a recently recognised risk factor for severe viral infections,
51 and in obese mothers prenatal exposure to a range of infections (such as influenza, 
Toxoplasma gondii, rubella, cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus) could have 
consequences for the offspring, including cardiometabolic and neurobehavioural diseases. It 
is not known if maternal obesity further increases susceptibility to vertical transmission of 
pathogens, though it is plausible that this may occur indirectly through exacerbation of the 
already altered maternal endocrine, immune, metabolic milieu and inflammatory status 
associated with maternal adiposity.52,53
A further important consideration is whether therapies used to treat maternal infection can 
also have adverse impacts on the offspring’s risk of later disease, through increasing 
maternal adiposity. Notably protease inhibitors, antiretrovirals (ARVs) used to prevent 
mother-to-child transmission of HIV, are associated with adverse maternal metabolic side 
effects. These include changes in maternal body composition including increased central 
adiposity, together with associated dyslipidaemia, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes and 
mitochondrial toxicity which may have long term effects on ARV-exposed infants.54 
Detailed studies will be required to establish the long term effects, and to determine optimal 
regimens to reduce any adverse outcomes.

 Offspring neurocognitive and behavioural outcomes
Despite the potential public health importance, relatively few cohort studies have examined 
associations between maternal obesity and detailed neuro-developmental outcomes in 
offspring (Table 1). For cognitive outcomes, human data showed that higher pre-pregnancy 
weight is associated with poorer cognitive outcomes, while higher (but not excessive) weight 
gain during pregnancy has been associated with better offspring cognitive outcomes.55,56 
However, published data do not allow definitive conclusions of potential effects of pre-
pregnancy adiposity on offspring cognitive development. Most studies found modest inverse 
associations with both early and later cognitive standardized assessments or reading and 
math scores,57 while a recent study found indications for a possible temporary increase in 
cognitive outcomes on a standardized assessment at 6 months.58 However, associations with 
maternal reports of cognitive performance were inconsistent in other large cohort studies.59
Maternal obesity has also been associated with offspring behavioural and emotional 
problems.57,60 A recent meta-analysis and longitudinal study found an increased risk for 
Autism Spectrum Disorders in children of mothers with obesity before/during pregnancy or 
excessive gestational weight gain,60,61 with other approaches suggesting a particularly 
robust association for excessive gestational weight gain .62 In 3 large European cohort 
studies the association between pre-pregnant obesity and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity 
Disorder was inconsistent, and lost when adjusted in full sibling comparisons.59,63 Fewer 
studies have investigated the association with affective disorders and no recent studies have 
investigated the link with anxiety, psychotic or eating disorders. Only one qualitative review 
has been published on pre-pregnancy obesity and schizophrenia, which suggested an 
association, although maternal schizophrenia was not taken into account.64 Although past 
studies reported contradictory results relating maternal obesity to offspring cerebral palsy,65 
large studies over the last 5 years have found positive associations, even after multiple 
adjustments.57
One major limitation of the above-mentioned studies is the difficulty in differentiating 
intrauterine effects from residual confounding. One way to explore this is to compare effect 
sizes of maternal obesity versus paternal obesity. However, even with maternal effect sizes, it 
is clear that other influences are also associated with both obesity and neurodevelopment, 
such as maternal intelligence, socio-economic status, breastfeeding, maternal mental health, 
maternal diet and other postnatal lifestyle influences. Other reasons for contradictory 
findings are differences in methodology, sampling biases, different ages of measuring 
outcomes and differences in defining obesity and outcomes. Some studies used retrospective 
self-reports of pre-pregnancy weight or maternal reports of offspring outcomes, which may 
be less reliable.55,59
In human studies it is difficult to confirm causation or to identify mechanisms linking 
maternal obesity with offspring neurodevelopment. However, studies in rodents and non-
human primates have indicated 3 potential pathways: 1) high levels of nutrients, including 
fatty acids and glucose; 2) high levels of hormones like leptin and insulin; 3) inflammatory 
mediators, including interleukins and tumor necrosis factor.57,66 These factors cross the 
placenta and can influence fetal neuroendocrine development, neuronal proliferation and

 brain development.57,66 Many dynamic factors play a role, with complex interactions 
between maternal environment, placental patho-physiology and fetal epigenetic changes. 
Indeed, animal studies showed that obesity during pregnancy can change brain homeostasis 
and offspring behaviour through epigenetic mechanisms, including in the serotonin and 
dopamine pathways, lipid peroxidation and corticosteroid receptor expression.67,68 Even 
parental lifestyle factors prior to and at conception may have transgenerational effects by 
epigenetic reprogramming at fertilization.69
Maternal obesity has many pathophysiological features in common with gestational 
diabetes, a condition increasingly associated with evidence of mild cognitive impairment in 
the offspring.58 For maternal obesity the paucity of current evidence indicates a need for 
large-scale studies with more detailed cognitive and behavioural phenotyping in populations 
of different cultures and ethnicities. Future studies should examine if maternal diet or 
obesity itself is more important for programming of neurodevelopmental outcomes, and 
include comprehensive assessments of diet and direct measurements of adiposity. Moreover, 
underlying mechanisms should be studied in humans with biomarkers including genetic and 
epigenetic modifications.
Epigenetic modifications: a potential underlying mechanism
Epigenetic processes are emerging as an important mechanism through which the “memory” 
of developmental exposures is held, with pathophysiological consequences for a variety of 
organs and systems. Epigenetic modifications have been proposed as a key causal 
mechanism linking maternal adiposity and offspring outcome.70 Moreover, there is now 
emerging evidence that epigenetic processes can act over several generations, including 
three or more generations and through the paternal line.71 Epigenetic modifications result in 
alterations in gene function in the absence of changes in the DNA sequence. The epigenetic 
marks which mediate this include DNA methylation, post-translational modification of 
histones and non-coding RNAs. DNA methylation occurring predominantly at cytosines in 
cytosine-guanine (CpG) dinucleotides is the most widely studied. Table 2 summarises the 
existing evidence linking maternal obesity in humans with offspring DNA methylation.
As shown in Table 2, a number of studies have used global methylation techniques to 
explore associations between maternal obesity and offspring DNA methylation. Though the 
findings are not consistent, three cohort studies found associations between maternal BMI 
and offspring DNA methylation at birth72,73 and at 3 years.74 Notably, in the largest and 
methodologically most robust study73 the methylation differences were only observed with 
comparisons of extreme groups of BMI (i.e. obese vs normal-weight) and not when the over-
weight group was compared with normal-weight group. Reasons are unknown but this 
observation may partly explain the negative findings in other studies where analyses have 
been conducted across a range of maternal BMI measurements.75,76 The observation of 
differentially methylated CpG sites in the peripheral blood of 2-25 year old siblings born to 
obese mothers before and after bariatric surgery with associated weight loss77 is also 
consistent with the hypothesis that maternal obesity impacts on offspring DNA methylation.

 Where a candidate gene approach has been adopted, associations between maternal 
adiposity and DNA methylation at imprinted genes78–80 or in a number of genes known to 
be involved in metabolism78–82 have been reported. Of particular interest is the observation 
that aryl-hydrocarbon receptor repressor (AHRR) DNA methylation is 2.1% higher in 
offspring of obese vs. normal weight mothers81; robust links are now established between 
maternal smoking and offspring AHRR methylation and there is much evidence that 
maternal smoking is associated with long term effects on offspring adiposity.15 The 
observations raise the possibility that AHRR DNA methylation may be involved in the link 
between maternal obesity and offspring adiposity. There is also evidence that maternal 
glycaemia is involved in causal pathways influencing offspring leptin epigenetic regulation.
83
Methodological considerations
Fixed genetic variants shared by mother and offspring are important confounders of 
proposed links between metabolic factors linked to maternal obesity and offspring outcomes, 
as are shared postnatal influences on diet/lifestyle behaviours84 and microbiome-related 
mechanisms.85 However, abdominal fat depots already differ at birth between groups with 
different risks of later metabolic disease86 and it seems likely that at least some of the 
effects of maternal obesity are mediated through prenatal environmental mechanisms. 
Further delineation of maternal effect modifiers will aid the development of interventions to 
improve offspring health, as will understanding of the underlying mechanisms and related 
biomarker signatures of these processes. Alongside giving insights into the fundamental 
processes and additional risk factors, such signatures will provide immediate outcome/
adherence measures for interventions, and enable identification of postnatal effect modifiers 
and stratification of infants for targeting of postnatal interventions.
Whilst the available data is consistent with the hypothesis that maternal obesity impacts on 
offspring DNA methylation changes at birth, whether these changes impact on development 
of later adverse outcomes in the offspring remains unclear. The observation that the 
methylation changes found at birth were also present at 3 year follow-up,74 provides some 
evidence that the methylation changes may persist over time. This, together with the 
observation of persistence of epigenetic marks associated with obesity across childhood and 
adolescence,87 raises the possibility that epigenetic analysis may provide useful biomarkers 
of disease risk across the lifespan. The findings do need to be interpreted with caution. Few 
studies have included attempts to replicate or validate findings through using a replication 
cohort,76 validation in comparison with published data73 or sex specificity. It is well 
established that many DNA methylation patterns are tissue- and cell- specific,88 so the 
relevance of findings from DNA extracted from cord or peripheral blood leukocytes remains 
unclear. However, there is also evidence that, for a number of non-imprinted genes, DNA 
methylation levels measured in blood are equivalent in buccal cells despite the fact that these 
cell types arise from different germ layers (mesoderm and ectoderm respectively).89
Whilst the majority of studies have utilised DNA extracted from blood leukocytes as a 
window on processes occurring in the fetus,72–76,78–81 the heterogeneity in sample 
population, study size, and the inconsistency between methodological approaches, makes

 comparison of studies challenging. Further, methodological considerations, particularly if 
complex tissues are used such as the placenta which contains mixed cell types, each with a 
distinct methylation pattern, may present problems with data interpretation.
We do not know whether the reported associations between maternal obesity and epigenetic 
processes are causal in relation to later outcomes, or whether they are merely a response to 
the maternal obesogenic environment, or are secondary to the changes in growth that occur 
in a fetus exposed to maternal obesity in utero. Obesity is also associated with changes in 
intestinal microbiota and epigenetic changes can also be induced by gut microbiome 
metabolites such as short chain fatty acids. Obesity associated changes in intestinal 
microbiota have implications for infant microbiome development with consequences for 
later child outcomes.90 Postnatal colonization of the microbiome in offspring has been 
linked to changes of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis linking brain function and 
intestinal bacteria.91 Studies indeed showed associations between changes in the 
microbiome and neurodevelopment disorders in which inflammation is implicated, such as 
autism-spectrum disorders and attention-deficit hypersensitivity disorder.92
Studies to test causality for effects of maternal obesity on offspring epigenetics in humans 
are hard to conduct; however, utilising associations with paternal obesity as a ‘negative 
control’, the demonstration that epigenetic modifications are more strongly associated with 
maternal than paternal obesity73 provides some support for the thesis that the associations of 
maternal obesity with offspring methylation are due to an intrauterine mechanism. The 
experimental demonstration that paternal diet prior to conception can have lasting effects on 
offspring outcomes through epigenetic processes does, however, add further complexity to 
an already complex situation.69 Further, many of the techniques used to investigate global 
DNA methylation changes are limited in coverage of the human epigenome. For example, 
the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array used in many recent studies73,77 only 
covers around 1.7% of all CpG sites in the genome and to date there has been little 
consideration of non-CpG methylation or 5-hydroxymethylation.93 More studies are needed 
that consider interaction of epigenetic changes with changes in the genome – recent studies 
suggest that around a quarter of the variation in neonatal methylomes arises from fixed 
genetic variants, with the remainder from gene-environment interactions.94
Conclusion
Although initial research linking developmental influences with major non-communicable 
disorders in later life focused on the effects of fetal undernutrition, increasing evidence 
indicates that exposure to maternal obesity also leads to an increased risk of disease in the 
offspring. Observational studies have provided strong evidence for associations between 
maternal obesity and an increase in the offspring’s risk of obesity, coronary heart disease, 
stroke, type 2 diabetes and asthma. Emerging evidence suggests that maternal obesity may 
be associated with poorer cognition in the offspring and an increased risk of 
neurodevelopmental disorders including cerebral palsy. With the exception of recent small 
studies of obese women who had bariatric surgery between pregnancies, there is a paucity of 
controlled intervention studies that have reversed maternal obesity and examined the 
consequences for the offspring. However, the offspring of obese women who lose weight

 prior to pregnancy have reduced risk of obesity95, and insights from experimental studies 
support a causal effect of maternal obesity on offspring outcomes in later life. Mechanistic 
insights also support causal effects on maternal obesity on the offspring, mediated through 
changes in epigenetic processes, and perhaps through alterations in the gut microbiome of 
the offspring. Table 4 lists key points for further research.
Greater insight is needed into the mechanisms acting in the mother, through which maternal 
obesity and excess nutrient supply impart increased risk for future metabolic disease. Pre-
pregnancy obesity predisposes the mother to gestational diabetes, hypertension and pre-
eclampsia which may affect placental function and fetal energy metabolism. In addition, 
obesity in pregnancy is associated with complex neuroendocrine, metabolic and immune/
inflammatory changes which likely impact on fetal hormonal exposure and nutrient supply.

The observations linking maternal obesity with lifelong consequences for the offspring have 
profound public health implications. The prevalence of overweight/obesity in women of 
childbearing age is increasing worldwide (with over 60% of women either overweight or 
obese at conception in the United States97), which will increase population of children 
exposed to an “obese intrauterine environment” and thus perpetuate cycle of increasing 
obesity and chronic disease burden. Public health measures that will rapidly reverse the 
current epidemic of maternal obesity appear implausible at present; in their absence, 
breaking the cycle of maternal and offspring obesity requires from a new generation of 
intervention studies, based on more detailed analysis of observational studies and designed 
with a better understanding of the underpinning mechanisms acting in the mother and 
offspring.

Key points for future research
•
Molecular mechanisms: Comprehensive experimental research is required into the epigenetic and 
other mechanisms linking maternal obesity to long term outcomes in the offspring. This will enable 
development of novel biomarkers and assist design of new intervention studies.
•
Lifestyle, nutritional and metabolic drivers: Detailed information is needed on the specific maternal 
lifestyle (e.g. physical activity, smoking, other environmental stressors), nutritional and metabolic 
exposures that underpin effects of maternal obesity on offspring outcomes. This needs to be 
combined with information on whether there are critical periods during development when such 
exposures have their effects and whether any outcomes are sex-specific.
•
Causality: Alongside mechanistic research, sophisticated observational studies are needed to obtain 
further insight into the (multiple) causalities of the observed associations. Such study designs 
include parent-offspring longitudinal cohorts, sib-pair analyses and the use of genetic variants and 
haplotypes as instrumental variables.
•
The need for new intervention studies: There is a paucity of intervention studies focused on 
remediation of maternal obesity before and during pregnancy, or on moderation of the effects of 
maternal obesity on the offspring. With a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms, new 
interventions need to be designed and tested, with long-term follow-up of the offspring.
