Global, regional, and national under-5 mortality, adult 
mortality, age-specific mortality, and life expectancy, 
1970–2016: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of 
Disease Study 2016
GBD 2016 Mortality Collaborators*
Summary
Background Detailed assessments of mortality patterns, particularly age-specific mortality, represent a crucial input that 
enables health systems to target interventions to specific populations. Understanding how all-cause mortality has 
changed with respect to development status can identify exemplars for best practice. To accomplish this, the Global 
Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 (GBD 2016) estimated age-specific and sex-specific all-cause 
mortality between 1970 and 2016 for 195 countries and territories and at the subnational level for the five countries with 
a population greater than 200 million in 2016.
Methods We have evaluated how well civil registration systems captured deaths using a set of demographic methods 
called death distribution methods for adults and from consideration of survey and census data for children younger 
than 5 years. We generated an overall assessment of completeness of registration of deaths by dividing registered deaths 
in each location-year by our estimate of all-age deaths generated from our overall estimation process. For 163 locations, 
including subnational units in countries with a population greater than 200 million with complete vital registration 
(VR) systems, our estimates were largely driven by the observed data, with corrections for small fluctuations in numbers 
and estimation for recent years where there were lags in data reporting (lags were variable by location, generally between 
1 year and 6 years). For other locations, we took advantage of different data sources available to measure under-5 
mortality rates (U5MR) using complete birth histories, summary birth histories, and incomplete VR with adjustments; 
we measured adult mortality rate (the probability of death in individuals aged 15–60 years) using adjusted incomplete 
VR, sibling histories, and household death recall. We used the U5MR and adult mortality rate, together with crude 
death rate due to HIV in the GBD model life table system, to estimate age-specific and sex-specific death rates for each 
location-year. Using various international databases, we identified fatal discontinuities, which we defined as increases in 
the death rate of more than one death per million, resulting from conflict and terrorism, natural disasters, major 
transport or technological accidents, and a subset of epidemic infectious diseases; these were added to estimates in the 
relevant years. In 47 countries with an identified peak adult prevalence for HIV
/AIDS of more than 0·5% and where VR 
systems were less than 65% complete, we informed our estimates of age-sex-specific mortality using the Estimation and 
Projection Package (EPP)-Spectrum model fitted to national HIV
/AIDS prevalence surveys and antenatal clinic 
serosurveillance systems. We estimated stillbirths, early neonatal, late neonatal, and childhood mortality using both 
survey and VR data in spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression models. We estimated abridged life tables for all 
location-years using age-specific death rates. We grouped locations into development quintiles based on the Socio-
demographic Index (SDI) and analysed mortality trends by quintile. Using spline regression, we estimated the expected 
mortality rate for each age-sex group as a function of SDI. We identified countries with higher life expectancy than 
expected by comparing observed life expectancy to anticipated life expectancy on the basis of development status alone.
Findings Completeness in the registration of deaths increased from 28% in 1970 to a peak of 45% in 2013; completeness 
was lower after 2013 because of lags in reporting. Total deaths in children younger than 5 years decreased from 1970 
to 2016, and slower decreases occurred at ages 5–24 years. By contrast, numbers of adult deaths increased in each 5-year 
age bracket above the age of 25 years. The distribution of annualised rates of change in age-specific mortality rate 
differed over the period 2000 to 2016 compared with earlier decades: increasing annualised rates of change were less 
frequent, although rising annualised rates of change still occurred in some locations, particularly for adolescent and 
younger adult age groups. Rates of stillbirths and under-5 mortality both decreased globally from 1970. Evidence for 
global convergence of death rates was mixed; although the absolute difference between age-standardised death rates 
narrowed between countries at the lowest and highest levels of SDI, the ratio of these death rates—a measure of relative 
inequality—increased slightly. There was a strong shift between 1970 and 2016 toward higher life expectancy, most 
noticeably at higher levels of SDI. Among countries with populations greater than 1 million in 2016, life expectancy at 
birth was highest for women in Japan, at 86·9 years (95% UI 86·7–87·2), and for men in Singapore, at 81·3 years 
(78·8–83·7) in 2016. Male life expectancy was generally lower than female life expectancy between 1970 and 2016, and 
the gap between male and female life expectancy increased with progression to higher levels of SDI. Some countries

with exceptional health performance in 1990 in terms of the difference in observed to expected life expectancy at birth 
had slower progress on the same measure in 2016.
Interpretation Globally, mortality rates have decreased across all age groups over the past five decades, with the largest 
improvements occurring among children younger than 5 years. However, at the national level, considerable 
heterogeneity remains in terms of both level and rate of changes in age-specific mortality; increases in mortality for 
certain age groups occurred in some locations. We found evidence that the absolute gap between countries in age-specific 
death rates has declined, although the relative gap for some age-sex groups increased. Countries that now lead in terms 
of having higher observed life expectancy than that expected on the basis of development alone, or locations that have 
either increased this advantage or rapidly decreased the deficit from expected levels, could provide insight into the 
means to accelerate progress in nations where progress has stalled.

Research in context
Evidence before this study
Three organisations periodically report on some dimensions of 
all-cause mortality: the UN Population Division (UNPD) produces 
revised estimates of age-specific mortality for 5-year intervals 
every 2 years; the United States Census Bureau reports periodically 
on life expectancy; and WHO produces estimates of life expectancy 
on a 2-year cycle, although these estimates are substantially based 
on those from the UNPD. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, 
and Risk Factors Study (GBD) produces the only annual 
assessment of trends in age-specific mortality for all locations with 
a population over 50 000 from 1970 to the present that is 
compliant with the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent 
Health Estimates Reporting (GATHER) standard.
Added value of this study
This study improves on the GBD 2015 assessment in 11 substantial 
ways. First, new data have been incorporated; at the national level 
we included 171 new location-years of vital registration data, 
41 new survey sources for under-5 mortality, eight new survey 
sources for adult mortality, and 15 667 new empirical life tables. 
New prevalence data were used to revise HIV/AIDS estimates and 
the fatal discontinuities database was updated. Second, we 
incorporated a new systematic analysis of data on educational 
attainment in reproductive-aged women, which is an important 
covariate for the estimation of under-5 mortality, and for 
educational attainment in the population older than 15 years, 
which is a covariate for adult mortality models. The new 
systematic analysis improved estimates, particularly for census and 
survey data that reported on categories of educational attainment 
such as primary school completion. Third, in previous GBD studies 
we used UNPD estimates of total fertility rate (TFR) and births. For 
this study, we did a systematic analysis of fertility data to estimate 
time series of TFR for each country and subnational location in the 
GBD study. Birth numbers used to compute the number of child 
deaths for GBD 2016 were estimated on the basis of TFR. These 
modifications led to substantial changes in estimated birth 
numbers in some countries and at the global level. Fourth, for the 
analysis of expected death rates based on the Socio-demographic 
Index (SDI), we updated SDI estimates and extended the SDI time 
series back to 1970 and used Gaussian process regression to fit the 
expected death rate for each age-sex group. Fifth, new subnational 
assessments for Indonesia by province and local government areas 
in England were included in the analysis. Sixth, in the modelling of 
HIV/AIDS, we replaced an assumed antiretroviral therapy (ART) 
allocation to those most in need with an empirical pattern derived 
from household surveys. This captured the allocation of ART in 
some cases to individuals who do not necessarily qualify in 
national guidelines. Seventh, given the interest in civil registration 
and vital statistics, we reported our estimated completeness of 
vital registration data for each location and year. Globally, 
completeness in the registration of deaths increased from 28% 
in 1970 to a peak of 45% in 2013. Eighth, since GBD 2010, we have 
estimated all-cause mortality from 1970 to the most recent 
estimation year. In this study, we present the full time series of 
these results for the first time. Ninth, given the rising interest in 
adverse trends in mortality for selected age groups—such as the 
increase in mortality in middle age in some locations—we focused 
on presenting age-specific trends in addition to summary 
measures of mortality such as life expectancy. Tenth, we used the 
time series of age-specific mortality rates to assess whether there 
has been convergence or divergence in either absolute or relative 
mortality rates. Finally, we formally assessed which countries had 
higher observed life expectancy than expected on the basis of their 
development status alone. These countries can potentially serve as 
exemplars on how to accelerate declines in mortality.
Implications of all the available evidence
The empirical basis for assessing age-specific mortality has 
improved; nearly 45% of deaths are now registered through civil 
registration and vital statistics and survey data provide measure-
ments for child and adult mortality in other settings. These data 
show that there have been substantial improvements in life 
expectancy over the past 47 years in nearly all locations assessed 
by GBD. From our analysis, a new set of countries emerged as 
exemplars for achieving better than expected life expectancy for 
their level of development, including Ethiopia and Peru.

Introduction
Mortality, particularly at younger ages, is a key measure 
of population health. Avoiding premature mortality from 
any cause is a crucial goal for every health system, and 
targets for mortality reduction are central in the 
development agenda for improving health.1,2 In the era of 
the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), reducing 
mortality rates among children was one of eight overall 
goals.3 In the current era of Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs), reducing neonatal and under-5 mortality 
remains a priority, accompanied by attention to reducing 
premature deaths among adults from non-communicable 
causes, road injuries, natural disasters, and other causes.4 
As the global health agenda broadens, the need for up-to-
date and accurate measurement of overall mortality 
continues to grow. Global interest in the convergence 
between death rates in countries with lower levels of 
development and those in countries at higher levels of 
development also adds value to the monitoring of age-
specific mortality rates over the long term.5 Evidence of 
stagnation or reversals in mortality rates in specific age-
sex groups in countries such as the USA and Mexico has 
also heightened interest in acquiring timely assessments 
of levels and trends in all-cause mortality.6–8
Age-specific mortality from all causes can be measured 
annually in locations with vital statistics from civil 
registration systems that capture more than 95% of all 
deaths. Incomplete civil registration data can also be 
used to monitor mortality if the completeness of 
reporting can be quantified. For countries with very 
incomplete or non-existent civil registration systems, 
age-specific mortality must be estimated from surveys, 
censuses, surveillance systems, and sample registration 
systems. Several regional groups regularly attempt to 
collate available mor 
tality data, including Eurostat, 
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and 
Development (OECD), and the Human Mortality 
Database. Fewer efforts attempt to estimate age-specific 
mortality rates based on some of the available data; these 
include the UN Population Division (UNPD),9 WHO,10 
the United States Census Bureau (USCB),11 and the 
Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors 
Study (GBD). The UNPD provides updated demographic 
estimates, for 5-year intervals, every 2 years; WHO 
provides annual life tables for 194 countries for the 
years 2000–15 with episodic updates; currently the USCB 
provides demographic estimates and projections up to 
the year 2050 for 193 countries. In addition to these 
efforts to measure mortality across all age groups, the 
United Nations Interagency Group for Child Mortality 
(IGME) produces periodic assess 
ments of mortality in 
children younger than 5 years for 195 countries.
Of these estimation efforts, the GBD study is unique. 
This study (GBD 2016) provides an annual update of the 
full time series from 1970 to the present for 195 countries 
or territories and for first administrative level dis-
aggregations for countries with a population greater than 
200 million, covering age-specific death rates and life 
table measures up to the age group 95 years or older. 
Estimates are based on statistical methods that yield 
95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) for all age-specific 
mortality rates and summary life table measures. The 
GBD study is also the only effort that fulfils the Guide-
lines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates 
Reporting (GATHER) requirements for transparent and 
accurate reporting.12 In contrast to the UNPD, WHO, 
and USCB estimates, in the GBD study, mortality among 
adult age groups in many locations without civil 
registration is not estimated solely on the basis of 
mortality levels for children younger than 5 years. Finally, 
the GBD study is based on the application of a set of 
standardised methods to all locations in a consistent 
manner, enabling comparisons between locations and 
over time, whereas other efforts at mortality estimation 
frequently use different methods or approaches in 
different countries.13–16
The primary objective of this study was to estimate all-
cause mortality by age, sex, and location from 1970 to 
2016. Compared with GBD 2015, the main changes that 
are reflected in this study include updates to data, 
methods, and presentation (Research in context panel). 
We use the time trend to 2016 to explore patterns by age 
and location, assess the convergence of absolute and 
relative mortality rates, and examine which countries 
have higher than expected life expectancy on the basis of 
their level of development using consistent methods and 
a comprehensively updated database.17 Because we re-
estimate the entire time series from 1970 to 2016 for all-
cause mortality, additions to data and revisions to 
methods mean that results from this study supersede all 
prior GBD results for all-cause mortality.
Methods
Overview
The goal of this analysis was to use all available data 
sources that met quality criteria to estimate mortality 
rates with 95% UIs for 23 age groups, by sex, for 
195 locations from 1970 to 2016 with subnational 
disaggregation for the five countries with a population 
greater than 200 million in 2016. The estimation process 
was complex because of the diversity of data types that 
provide relevant information on death rates in different 
age groups. Here we provide a broad explanation of the 
GBD 2016 mortality analysis with an emphasis on the 
challenges these methods address, while the appendix 
provides detailed descriptions of each step in the 
analytical process.
In general, locations can be divided into two groups: 
80 countries and territories with a civil registration 
system or sample registration system that captures more 
than 95% of all deaths (complete vital registration [VR]) 
and the remaining 115 countries or territories. For 
countries with complete VR, there are two main 
measurement challenges: dealing with problems of

small numbers for some age-sex groups, and lags in the 
reporting of VR data that mean generated estimates for 
the most recent year must be estimated from data 
reported 1–5 years previously. To account for lags in data, 
we used models with covariates and spatiotemporal 
effects to estimate the years since the last measurement. 
In the remaining 115 countries and territories, our 
modelling process took advantage of the greater volume 
of survey and census data available for measuring 
under-5 mortality rate (U5MR) compared with the lower 
volumes of data, primarily from sibling histories and 
incomplete VR, for mortality in adults aged 15 to 60 years 
(45q15). We used the available data for U5MR, 45q15, and 
covariates to generate a best estimate with uncertainty 
for these quantities in each location-year. Building on a 
decades-long tradition in demographic estimation, we 
estimate age-sex specific death rates for a location-year 
using information on under-5 child mortality, adult 
mortality, crude death rate due to HIV, and a set of 
expected associations with death rates in each age-sex 
group—called a model life table.18–20 In previous analyses, 
the GBD model life tables have been shown to perform 
better in predicting age-specific mortality than have other 
model life table systems.20
The modelling approach for countries without 
complete VR was modified to deal with two classes of 
events that were not well captured by the demographic 
process of estimating under-5 and adult mortality by use 
of model life tables: fatal discontinuities and locations 
with large HIV/AIDS epidemics. Fatal discontinuities are 
abrupt changes in death rates related to conflicts and 
terrorism, disasters, or acute epidemics such as Ebola 
virus disease. We use data from various databases 
tracking these mortality events to modify estimates of 
death rates made from data excluding these events. 
Second, in the 47 countries with VR systems that are less 
than 65% complete, and where the peak prevalence of 
the HIV/AIDS epidemic reached more than 0·5%, 
the rapid increases in death rates from HIV
/AIDS, 
particularly in younger adults (aged 15–49 years), 
were not well-captured by the standard demographic 
estimation model. For these countries, we used a 
modelling process that also uses information on the 
prevalence of HIV/AIDS from surveys and surveillance 
as a further input.
As with the previous iteration of the GBD study, this 
analysis adheres to GATHER standards developed by 
WHO and others.12 A table detailing our mechanism for 
adhering to GATHER is included in section 8 of the 
appendix (p 77); statistical code used in the entire process 
is available through an online repository. Analyses were 
done with Python versions 2.5.4 and 2.7
.3, Stata 
version 13.1, or R version 3.1.2.
Geographic units and time periods
The GBD study organises geographic units, or locations, 
by use of a set of hierarchical categories, beginning with 
seven super-regions; 21 regions are nested within those 
super-regions; and 195 countries or territories within the 
21 regions (appendix section 1, p 4). For GBD 2016, new 
subnational assessments were added for Indonesia by 
province and England by local government areas. In this 
Global Health Metrics paper, we present data from 
subnational assessments for the five countries with a 
population greater than 200 million in 2016: Brazil, 
China, India, Indonesia, and the USA. Detailed 
subnational assessments will be reported in separate 
studies or reports; appendix section 1 (p 4) provides a 
description of all subnational assessments included in 
the analytical phase for GBD 2016. All-cause mortality 
covers the period 1970 to 2016; online data visualisation 
tools are available that provide results for each year of 
estimation in addition to what is presented here and in 
the appendix (p 4).
Completeness of VR
Many countries operate civil registration systems to 
register births and deaths, with causes of death certified 
by a medical doctor; individual records are tabulated to 
produce annual vital statistics on births and deaths from 
these civil registration systems. VR data thus refers to 
data sourced from civil registration and vital statistics 
systems; India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh operate sample 
registration systems that collect data from a representative 
sample of communities in those countries. For all VR 
systems and sample registration systems, we have 
evaluated how well these systems have captured deaths 
in adults using a set of demographic methods called 
death distribution methods (DDM).21,22 There are several 
well-described variants in DDM methods, each with 
particular advantages and limitations; in simulation 
studies, we found no real advantage for one method over 
the others.21 Additional details of our use of DDM are 
available in appendix section 2 (p 25). The completeness 
of registration systems in tabulating deaths for children 
younger than 5 years was based on consideration of 
survey and census data for the same populations. We 
generated an overall assessment of completeness of 
registration for all age groups combined by dividing 
registered deaths in each location-year by our estimate of 
all-age deaths generated from our overall estimation 
process.
New data sources in GBD 2016
GBD 2016 estimated mortality from a comprehensive 
database that included both data from prior years (ie, 
1970–2014) that were not available in previous GBD 
assessments and the most recent data sources, which 
might not yet have been publicly available. New data 
sources for GBD 2016 supplied an additional 171 location-
years of VR data at the national level and 6902 location-
years of VR and 45 sample registration years including 
all subnational locations, 13 complete birth history 
sources at the national level and three complete birth

histories added for subnational locations, 28 national and 
45 subnational summary birth history data sources, and 
eight national and six subnational sibling history surveys. 
The all-cause mortality databases used in GBD 2016 
included a total of 165 674 point estimates of U5MR, 
47 279 point estimates of 45q15, and 32 174 empirical life 
tables. The availability of data by year is summarised in 
appendix section 8 (p 159); data sources by location can 
also be identified with an online source tool.
Estimating educational attainment, total fertility rate, 
and births
For GBD 2016, we substantially revised the systematic 
analysis of educational attainment. The new estimation 
is based on 2160 unique location-years of data for 
educational attainment. The method for estimating 
average years of schooling for categorical responses 
(such as primary school) was revised to reflect national 
and regional variation in school duration. Appendix 
section 4 (p 55) provides details on how educational 
attainment was estimated from these data sources, 
including the cross-validation of the modelling approach.
For GBD 2016, we did a systematic analysis of data on 
the total fertility rate (TFR); using surveys, census, and 
civil registration data, we identified 16 847 location-years 
of data for TFR. We used spatiotemporal Gaussian 
process regression (ST-GPR) to estimate the time trend 
of TFR in each location. Details of data and methods 
used in this systematic analysis are available in appendix 
section 3 (p 53). We estimated births for each location-
year on the basis of the estimated TFR using the age 
patterns of fertility produced by the UNPD. Since births 
are an important input to under-5 mortality and still-
birth estimation, this change of method impacted the 
all-cause mortality and stillbirth estimates. 
Stillbirths, early neonatal, late neonatal, post-neonatal, 
and childhood mortality
The numbers of location-years for which any data from 
VR systems, surveys, and censuses were available to 
estimate 
the 
overall 
level 
of 
under-5 
mortality 
between 1970 and 2016 are presented in the appendix 
(section 8 p 143). Point estimates of U5MR were 
generated with both direct and indirect estimation 
methods applied to survey responses of mothers; 
additional details of location-specific and year-specific 
measurements are available in appendix section 2 (p 7). 
We used ST-GPR to generate the full time series of 
estimates of U5MR for each location included in GBD 
2016 after the application of a bias adjustment process to 
standardise 
across 
disparate 
data 
sources. 
This 
estimation process is described in detail in appendix 
section 2 (p 11).
We modelled the ratio of the stillbirth rate to the 
neonatal death rate using ST-GPR. This ratio was 
modelled as a function of educational attainment of 
women of reproductive age, a non-linear function of the 
neonatal death rate, location random effects, and random 
effects for specific data source types nested within each 
location. In the source data collated for our database, 
stillbirth was variously defined as fetal death after 20, 22, 
24, 26, and 28 weeks’ gestation, or weighing at least 
500 g or 1000 g. Additionally, our database contained 
1066 location-years for which no stillbirth definition was 
provided. We accounted for variation in stillbirth 
definitions in the original data, including no definition, 
by adjusting the data with scalars developed by Blencowe 
and colleagues.23 Further details of data source and 
definition adjustments and the development and use of 
covariates in the modelling process for stillbirth 
estimation are provided in appendix section 2 (p 21).
Adult mortality estimation
Our estimates of adult mortality were developed using data 
from VR systems, censuses, and household surveys of the 
survival histories of siblings. The number of years for 
which data were available for adult mortality estimation by 
location—an indication of data completeness—are shown 
in appendix section 8 (p 143). Although sibling survival 
data have known biases, including selection bias, zero 
reporter bias, and recall bias,24,25 they are one of the most 
important, and sometimes only, sources of information on 
the levels and trends of adult mortality rate in some 
locations. We used an improved sibling survival method 
to account for these biases as detailed by Obermeyer 
and colleagues.25 We applied this method to each 
new data source that contains sibling histories. We 
used ST-GPR with lag-distributed income per capita, 
edu 
cational attainment, and the estimated HIV
/AIDS 
death rate as covariates to estimate adult mortality for 
each location.
Age-specific mortality from GBD model life table system
Age-specific mortality among age groups older than 
5 years was estimated from U5MR, 45q15, crude death 
rate due to HIV in corresponding age groups, and a 
location-year standard in the GBD model life table 
system. The location-year standard was selected from the 
database of 15 221 empirical life tables that met strict 
quality inclusion criteria (appendix section 2 p 39). The 
selection of the standard was designed to capture 
location-specific differences in the relative pattern of 
mortality over different ages.17 In locations with complete 
VR, the GBD model life table system standard was driven 
almost exclusively by the observed age pattern of 
mortality in that location. In locations without complete 
VR, the standard was derived from locations with high-
quality life tables that had similar levels of U5MR and 
adult mortality. To capture regional differences in age 
patterns of mortality that might be driven by different 
causes of death, the selection of the standard gives 
preference to life tables that are proximate in space and 
time. The availability of empirical age patterns of 
mortality in the GBD database is summarised in

appendix section 6 (p 80); the development of a standard 
age pattern of mortality from these data is summarised 
in appendix section 2 (p 7).
Fatal discontinuities
In the GBD study a fatal discontinuity is defined as 
conflict and terrorism, a natural disaster, a major trans-
port or technological accident, or one of a subset of 
epidemic infectious diseases that results in an abrupt 
increase in mortality greater than one death per million 
for all ages or that caused more than 100 deaths. We 
identified data for these discontinuities from a range of 
international databases;26–29 specific sources are listed in 
appendix section 5 (p 59) and in the online source 
tool. Events in locations for which we do subnational 
assessments were geolocated to the appropriate sub-
national unit. When mortality from a fatal discontinuity 
was only available as a point estimate rather than as a 
range, we used the regional cause-specific UI to estimate 
uncertainty for that event. To supplement the temporal 
lags in these databases, we used additional searches 
of internet sources to find information on fatal 
discontinuities occurring in the most recent year. If 
conflicting data sources were identified for a single event, 
we used estimates sourced from VR systems over 
alternative estimates identified from internet searches. 
Ebola virus disease, cholera, and meningococcal men-
ingitis were the subset of epidemic infectious diseases 
included as fatal discontinuities. Cholera and men-
ingococcal meningitis were added as cause-specific fatal 
discontinuities for GBD 2016 because their current 
modelling strategy did not optimally capture epidemic 
mortality levels and trends, and they have contributed to 
substantial total fatalities in a given location-year. More 
information on these methods is listed in appendix 
section 5 (p 58).
Estimating mortality in locations with high HIV/AIDS 
prevalence and without complete VR
In 47 countries with VR completeness less than 65% 
and where the peak adult prevalence of HIV
/AIDS 
exceeded 0·5%, we modified our estimation approach 
to account for the specific temporal patterns of the 
HIV/AIDS epidemic and the concentration of mortality 
in younger adult age groups (ages 15–49 years). First, an 
HIV/AIDS-free age pattern of mortality (assuming zero 
deaths due to HIV/AIDS) was estimated using the 
estimation methods already described and setting the 
HIV/AIDS crude death rate to zero. We then add on to 
the HIV-free age pattern of mortality the excess mortality 
due to HIV/AIDS by using the age pattern of the relative 
risk of dying from HIV estimated in the UNAIDS 
Spectrum model (Spectrum).30 This step provides the 
implied HIV/AIDS-related mortality based on demo-
graphic sources. Second, we used a combination of the 
Estimation and Projection Package (EPP)31 and a 
modification of Spectrum30 to estimate the HIV
/AIDS-
related death rate using data on HIV
/AIDS prevalence, 
prevention 
of 
mother-to-child 
transmission, 
ART 
coverage, and assumptions about the natural history of 
the disease embedded in the Spectrum model. For 
GBD 2016, to capture the allocation of ART to individuals 
who do not necessarily qualify in national guidelines, we 
replaced the prior assumption of ART allocation to those 
most in need with an empirical pattern derived from 
household surveys. For two countries, Myanmar and 
Cambodia, we used the UNAIDS estimates of incidence 
derived from the Asian Epidemic Model because the 
underlying prevalence data were not available to 
model with EPP-Spectrum. Third, our final estimate of 
HIV
/AIDS-related mortality in these 47 countries was the 
average of the demographic source estimate and the 
HIV
/AIDS natural history model estimate. We used both 
approaches because of the inconsistency in some 
countries between these sources that results from the 
large uncertainty associated with data for adult mortality 
derived only from sibling histories and the sensitivity of 
the EPP-Spectrum estimates of mortality to assumptions 
on progression of disease and death rates and scale-up 
of ART. Details of this multistep process, including 
safeguards to ensure that the HIV
/AIDS-free estimate of 
mortality is not artificially depressed by overestimation 
of HIV
/AIDS-related mortality, are described in appendix 
section 2 (p 46).
Socio-demographic Index and expected mortality 
analysis
To move beyond binary descriptions such as developed 
and developing countries and assessments of develop-
ment status based solely on income per capita, a Socio-
demographic Index (SDI) was developed for GBD 2015. 
GBD 2015 used the Human Development Index method32 
to compute SDI. SDI was calculated as the geometric 
mean of the rescaled values of lag-distributed income per 
capita (LDI), average years of education in the population 
older than 15 years, and TFR. The rescaling of each 
component variable was based on the minimum and 
maximum values observed for each component during 
the examined time period.17 Alter 
native approaches to 
equal weighting, such as principal components analysis, 
yielded results that were correlated (Pearson correlation 
0·994, p<0·0001; more detail on the correlation used is 
listed in appendix section 6, p 62). In response to the 
addition of more subnational locations for GBD 2016—
with further expansion anticipated in subsequent 
iterations—a fixed scale was developed for the rescaling 
of each component of SDI in GBD 2016. For each 
component, an index score of zero for a component 
represents the level below which we have not observed 
GDP per capita or educational attainment or above which 
we have not observed the TFR in known datasets. 
Maximum scores for educational attainment and LDI 
represent the maximum levels of the plateau in the 
relationship between each of the two components and

the selected health outcomes, suggesting no additional 
benefit. Analogously, the maximum score for TFR 
represents the minimum level at which the relationship 
with the selected health outcomes plateaued. Detail for 
the development of these fixed-scale restrictions on SDI 
components is shown in appendix section 4 (p 55). The 
final SDI score for each location in each year was 
calculated as the geometric mean of the component 
scores for that location. The correlation between the SDI 
computed for GBD 2016 with these updated methods 
and that calculated for GBD 2015 was 0·977 (p<0·0001). 
Aggregate results are reported for the GBD 2016 study by 
locations grouped into quintiles; thresholds defining 
quintiles were selected on the basis of the distribution of 
SDI for the year 2016 for national-level GBD locations 
with populations greater than 1 million. The classifi-
cation of locations into these quintiles is shown in 
appendix section 8 (p 98). Additional details of the 
development of this index are provided in appendix 
section 4 (p 57).
For GBD 2015, we characterised the relationship 
between SDI and death rates for every age-sex 
combination using first-order basis splines. For GBD 
2016 we have improved the robustness and replicability 
of the estimation of this relationship. We used Gaussian 
process regression (GPR) with a linear prior for the mean 
function to estimate expected all-cause mortality rates for 
each age-sex group on the basis of SDI alone using data 
from 1970 to 2016. We examined the expected age-sex-
specific mortality rates by SDI to confirm that mortality 
rates were consistent with known relationships (eg, 
Gompertz–Makeham law) and that there was no overlap 
in age-sex-specific mortality rates estimated across SDI 
levels. The set of expected age and sex mortality rates was 
used to generate a complete expected life table based on 
SDI. Finally, we made draw-level comparisons between 
observed life expectancy at birth (E0) and expected E0 
based on SDI to identify location-years where this 
difference was statistically significant. These comparisons 
between expected values and observed levels for age-sex-
specific mortality rates and life expectancy at birth were 
used to identify locations where improvements in life 
expectancy were greater than anticipated on the basis of 
SDI alone. We examined age-specific and sex-specific 
correlations between starting levels of mortality and 
annualised rates of change in mortality rate and the 
absolute change in the mortality rate to assess available 
evidence for either relative or absolute convergence in 
death rates, respectively.
Uncertainty analysis
We have systematically estimated uncertainty throughout 
the all-cause mortality estimation process. For U5MR, 
completeness synthesis, and adult mortality rate esti-
mation, uncertainty comes from sampling error by data 
source and non-sampling error. For the model life 
table step and the determination of HIV
/AIDS-specific 
mortality, uncertainty comes from the sampling error 
and regression parameters in EPP and from uncertainty 
in the life table standard. We generated 1000 draws of 
each all-cause mortality metric including U5MR, adult 
mor 
tality rate, age-specific mortality rates, overall mor-
tality, and life expectancy. All analytical steps are linked at 
the draw level and uncertainty of all key mortality metrics 
are propagated throughout the all-cause mortality esti 
-
mation process. The 95% uncertainty intervals were 
computed using the 2·5th and 97·5th percentile of the 
draw level values.
Role of the funding source
The funders of the study had no role in study design, 
data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or 
writing of the report. All authors had full access to the 
data in the study and had final responsibility for the 
decision to submit for publication.
Results
Civil registration and vital statistics completeness
At the global level, registration of deaths increased 
from 28% in 1970 to a peak of 45% in 2013. Death 
registration completeness declined after 2013 because of 
lags in reporting. Completeness of registration in 
creased 
steadily, although slowly, at 0·35 percentage points per 
year on average through to 2008. The improvement 
since 2008 was largely driven by sub 
stantial increases in 
the registration of deaths in China, which reached 64% 
by 2015. Figure 1 shows the completeness of registration 
as a time series by location for 1990–2016. Registration 
was deemed complete (ie, more than 95%) in nearly all 
countries in western Europe, central Europe, eastern 
Europe, Australasia, and North America. Completeness 
was more variable in Latin America and the Caribbean, 
where several coun 
tries, such as Peru and Ecuador, have 
maintained completeness levels in the range of 70–94% 
since 1995, whereas others, such as Costa Rica, Cuba, 
and Argentina, have had complete systems for many 
years. Completeness was highly variable across countries 
in north Africa and the Middle East and across countries 
in southeast Asia. Of note, the Indian Sample Registration 
System completeness ranged from 92% to complete. 
Recent 
improvements 
include 
the 
increase 
in 
completeness in Iran from 64% in 1996 to 91% in 2015, 
an increase in Nicaragua from 75% in 1990 to 94% 
in 2013, and an increase in Thailand from 78% in 1990 to 
complete registration from 2005 to 2014. A few settings 
have seen declines in completeness including Albania, 
Uzbekistan, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, and the 
Bahamas.
Long-term trends in global mortality
The total number of deaths in the world per year increased 
from 42·8 million (95% UI 42·3 million to 43·3 million) 
in 1970 to 46·5 million (46·2 million to 46·9 million) 
in 1990 and 54·7 million (54·0 million to 55·5 million)

in 2016. These changes reflect interplay between mortality 
rates, population totals, and the ageing of the world’s 
populations. Figure 2 shows the change in the global 
number of deaths by age group estimated for the 
years 1970, 2000, and 2016. The number of under-5 deaths 
decreased from 16·4 million (16·1 million to 16·7 million) 
in 1970 to 8·7 million (8·5 million to 9·0 million) in 2000, 
and to 5·0 million (4·8 million to 5·2 million) in 2016. 
Decreases between time periods were also evident, 
although at a lower magnitude, for ages 5–24 years. By 
contrast, the number of adult deaths generally increased 
relative to 1970. Deaths among younger adults

(25–49 years) increased from 4·8 million (4·7 million to 
4·9 million) in 1970 to 7·5 million (7·4 million to 
7·6 million) in 2000, but decreased to 6·9 million 
(6·7 million to 7·0 million) in 2016. The rate of increase in 
deaths for older adults (50–74 years) has been steady, 
increasing from 11·8 million (11·7 million to 12·0 million) 
in 1970 to 17·7 million (17·5 million to 17·8 million) 
in 2000, and to 20·0 million (19·6 million to 20·2 million) 
in 2016. Increases in adult deaths were largest in age 
groups older than 75 years; there were 6·7 million 
(6·6 million to 6·7 million) deaths among people 75 years 
and older in 1970, increasing to 14·7 million (14·6 million 
to 14·8 million) in 2000, and to 20·8 million 
(20·5–21·1 million) in 2016.
From 1970 to 2016, global mortality rates decreased for 
both men and women (appendix section 8 p 358). Age-
standardised death rates for women decreased from 
1367·4 per 100 000 (95% UI 1351·5 to 1384·2) in 1970 to 
1036·9 per 100 000 (1026·9 to 1,047·4) in 1990 and 690·5 
per 100 000 (678·2 to 706·3) in 2016, an annualised 
decrease of 1·49% during the period 1970 to 2016. The 
male age-standardised death rate declined from 1724·7 
per 100 000 (1698·5 to 1751·8) in 1970 to 1407·5 per 
100 000 (1394·7 to 1421·3) in 1990 and 1002·4 per 100 000 
(985·1 to 1020·8) in 2016, an annualised decrease of 
1·18% per year from 1970 to 2016. Over the same period, 
global life expectancy at birth for both sexes combined 
increased from 58·4 years (95% UI 57·9–58·9) in 1970 to 
65·1 years (64·9–65·3) in 1990 and 72·5 years (72·1–72·8) 
in 2016 (appendix section 8 p 279). Life expectancy 
remains higher for women than for men on a global 
scale, with an estimated life expectancy at birth in 2016 of 
75·3 years (75·0–75·6) for women and 69·8 years 
(69·3–70·2) for men; the absolute increase in life 
expectancy at birth was 14·8 years (14·1–15·4) for women 
(60·5 years [60·2–60·9] in 1970), but 13·5 years 
(12·3–14·6) for men (56·3 years [55·6–57·0] in 1970). 
The rate of increase in female life expectancy at birth was 
greater than that for men, rising by 0·32 years per year 
between 1970 and 2016 while the annualised rate for 
global male life expectancy at birth rose by 0·29 years 
per year over the same period. The difference in life 
expectancy at birth between men and women globally 
increased to 5·5 years in 2016 from 4·2 years in 1970. Life 
expectancy at age 65 years increased in 189 of 
195 countries between 1970 and 2016.
Figure 3 shows the distribution of annualised rates of 
change in mortality rates by age group and sex for 
locations grouped within GBD super-regions. From 1970 
to 1980 (figure 3A), age-specific mortality rates decreased 
in the most locations for both sexes. Increases in 
annualised mortality rates did occur in many locations, 
notably across most age groups for locations in the super-
region of central Europe, eastern Europe, and central 
Asia. The largest annualised increases occurred for 
adolescent and younger adult males (aged 15–34 years) in 
north Africa and the Middle East; southeast Asia, 
east Asia, and Oceania; and Latin America and the 
Caribbean. By contrast, the largest decreases in rates of 
change occurred for children younger than 5 years, 
particularly in the GBD super-regions of the high-income 
countries, Latin America and the Caribbean, and north 
Africa and the Middle East, while decreasing rates also 
occurred in young people aged 5–19 years in the super-
regions of southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania and 
south Asia. Between 1980 and 1990 (figure 3B), rates 
notably increased in adolescent age groups in sub-
Saharan Africa and in older adult age groups (older than 
70 years) in the high-income super-region. Decreases in 
annualised rates of change occurred across most age

groups and for both sexes in north Africa and the Middle 
East, with large decreases for children younger than 
5 years. From 1990 to 2000 (figure 3C), annualised 
increases occurred in more locations than in the previous 
decades, particularly for locations in sub-Saharan Africa, 
but also for locations in central Europe, eastern Europe, 
and central Asia, and for locations in Latin America and 
the Caribbean. Increased annualised rates of change also 
occurred for adults of both sexes older than 70 years in 
the super-region of southeast Asia, east Asia, and 
Oceania. The distribution of annualised rates of change 
in age-specific mortality was visibly different over the 
period 2000 to 2016 compared with previous periods, 
with fewer instances of increasing annualised rates of 
change. Most annualised rates of change in age-specific 
mortality rates decreased, particularly for young adults 
(25–49 years) in sub-Saharan Africa and for children 
younger than 5 years in almost all GBD locations. 
However, notable exceptions included adolescents and 
younger adults in some locations in north Africa and the 
Middle East and adolescents in some locations in sub-
Saharan Africa. Smaller increases were scattered across 
locations and age groups within other super-regions. 
Annualised rates of change in mortality rates bet-
ween 2000 and 2016 were greater than 5·0% in 15 age-
sex-location groups and greater than 10·0% in Syria for 
males aged 15–19 years (10·5%), 20–24 years (12·9%), 
and 25–29 years (11·2%) and females aged 10–14 years 
(10·2%).
Figure 4 shows that the absolute difference between 
the age-standardised death rate for locations in the 
lowest SDI quintile and highest SDI quintile (countries 
classified by their 2016 level of SDI) narrowed 
between 1970 and 2016. However, the ratio of death rates

in the lowest SDI quintile to those in the highest SDI 
quintile, a measure of relative inequality, increased over 
the same period. Whether this pattern is interpreted as 
convergence or divergence in death rates depends on 
which metric—the ratio of death rates or the absolute 
difference in death rates—is evaluated. Relative con-
vergence can also be assessed by correlating annualised 
rates of change between time periods with starting 
levels of mortality. A positive correlation between the 
rate of change by age and the starting level of death rate 
indicates that countries with higher starting levels of 
mortality in an age group also had slower rates of 
decline or even increases, suggesting divergence in 
mortality rates; a negative correlation would indicate 
convergence. Figure 5A shows these correlations by age 
and sex. There was more evidence of divergence by age 
group over the period 1970 to 2016 for women (positive 
correlations) with the exceptions of ages 1–4 years and 
older than 85 years. Correlations were negative for 
females aged 5–9 years, 10–14 years, 15–19 years, and 
20–24 years; however, the UIs for these correlations 
included zero. For men, evidence of convergence was 
clearer, with negative correlations between starting 
levels of mortality in 1970 and subsequent rates of 
change occurring for ages 1–4 years, 15–19 years, 
20–24 years, and for each 5-year age group older than 
65 years; negative correlations were also estimated for 
males aged 25–29 years, 55–59 years, and 60–64 years, 
although UIs for these correlations included zero. 
Correlations between the absolute change in age-sex-
specific mortality rates between 1970 and 2016 and 
starting levels of mortality in 1970 (figure 5B) suggest 
convergence in mortality rates across all age groups for 
both men and women. Because small rates of change 
might nevertheless produce large magnitude differences 
when starting levels are high, negative correlations 
from absolute measures—apparent convergence in 
levels—might effectively mask evidence of diverging 
mortality rates.
Stillbirths and child mortality
Numbers and rates of stillbirths across locations in 2016 
are presented in table 1. In 2016, there were 1·7 million 
(95% UI 1·6 million to 1·8 million) stillbirths worldwide, 
a decrease of 65·3% since 1970. This decrease occurred 
against a background increase in the number of livebirths 
worldwide, which rose from 114·1 million in 1970 to 
128·8 million in 2016. Rates of stillbirth decreased by 
68·4%, from 41·5 deaths per 1000 livebirths (38·0–45·6) 
in 1970 to 13·1 deaths per 1000 livebirths (12·5–13·9) in 
2016. The lowest rate of stillbirths in 2016 was 1·1 per 
1000 (1·0–1·2) in Finland; stillbirth rates were highest in 
South Sudan at 43·4 per 1000 (42·4–44·5). 
Regionally, stillbirth rates were highest among the 
countries of central sub-Saharan Africa, where rates 
exceeded 23 per 1000 in 2016. Rates were highly variable 
across south and southeast Asia, spanning 3·5 per 1000 
(3·2–3·7) in Malaysia to 25·9 per 1000 (25·1–26·8) in 
Pakistan. Only six countries in western Europe had 
stillbirth rates below 1·5 per 1000 in 2016. Across the 
Americas, no country had a stillbirth rate below 1·5 in 
2016. For 114 of 195 countries, decreases in stillbirth rates 
were most rapid in the most recent decades; annualised 
stillbirth rates in these countries decreased faster in the 
years after 2000 than in the period 1990–2000.
Rates of mortality for children younger than 5 years 
decreased globally between 2000 and 2016, from 69·4 per 
1000 livebirths (67·2–71·8) to 38·4 per 1000 livebirths 
(34·5–43·1); since 2000, U5MR has decreased in 189 of 
195 countries. Table 1 also shows the variation in levels of 
U5MR in 2016, which ranged from 2·2 per 1000 livebirths 
(1·8–2·6) in Luxembourg to 130·6 per 1000 livebirths 
(97·2–176·9) in the Central African Republic. Not only 
were levels highly variable, but there was considerable 
variation in rates of change over the period 2000–16. The 
largest annualised change for this time period was 
estimated for Botswana, with a decrease of 9·1% 
(7·1–10·9). In other locations, rates of change ranged 
from an annualised decrease of 8·9% (8·1–9·7) in the 
Maldives to an annualised increase of 2·5% (–1·7 to 6·0) 
in Syria. In the SDG era, the target for U5MR has been 
set as 25 deaths per 1000 livebirths by 2030 with a target 
for neonatal mortality of 12 deaths per 1000 livebirths. As 
of 2016, the SDG target for U5MR had been met or

exceeded in 121 countries and the SDG target for neonatal 
death rate had been met or exceeded by 118 countries.
Age-specific mortality rates for children younger than 
5 years varied across locations (table 1). Neonatal 
mortality was greater than mortality in the 1–4 year age 
group in 19 of the 21 GBD regions; for example, in 
southern sub-Saharan Africa, rates of mortality for 
neonates in 2016 (17·6 deaths per 1000 livebirths, 
95% UI 14·6–21·4) were 1·6 times greater than those 
for the 1–4 year age group (10·8 per 1000 livebirths, 
9·0–13·0). Mortality rates were highest for children 
aged 1–4 years in the GBD regions of western sub-
Saharan Africa and central sub-Saharan Africa (18·1 per 
1000 livebirths, 15·5–21·5) and central sub-Saharan 
Africa (27·5 per 1000 livebirths, 20·4–36·4). The range 
of mortality rates across countries was also largest 
within this age group, from 0·4 deaths per 1000 
(0·3–0·6) in Finland to 56·6 per 1000 (46·4–68·6) in 
Niger in 2016. 
Regionally, 24·8% of under-5 deaths in 2016 occurred 
in South Asia (1·2 million deaths, 95% UI 1·2 million to 
1·3 million), with a further 28·1% in western sub-
Saharan Africa (1·4 million deaths, 1·3 million to 
1·6 million), and 16·3% in eastern sub-Saharan Africa 
(0·8 million, 0·8 million to 0·9 million). In absolute 
terms, the largest number of under-5 deaths nationally 
in 2016 occurred in India at 0·9 million (0·8 million to 
0·9 million) followed by Nigeria (0·7 million, 0·6 million 
to 0·9 million) and the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo (0·3 million, 0·1 million to 0·4 million).
Adult mortality and life expectancy in 2016
Summary measures of adult mortality, life expectancy at 
birth, and life expectancy at age 65 years in 2016 are 
presented in table 2. Among countries with populations 
greater than 1 million in 2016, mortality rates were 
highest in the countries of sub-Saharan Africa, where 
16 of 46 countries had mortality rates in excess of 
1500 deaths per 100 000, including the highest global age-
standardised mortality rate of 2470·7 per 100 000 in the 
Central African Republic. The lowest age-standardised 
mortality rates in 2016 were in countries in the 
high-income Asia Pacific region: the lowest rate globally 
was in Japan at 379·0 per 100 000.
On a global level, life expectancy at birth increased 
overall by 13·5 years for men and 14·8 years for women 
from 1970 to 2016. In 2016 there was a 1·7-times 
difference between the lowest overall life expectancy of 
50·2 years (95% UI 47·3–53·3) in the Central African 
Republic to the highest of 83·9 years (83·8–84·1) in 
Japan. The highest life expectancy was in Singapore for 
men, at 81·3 years (78·8–83·7), and in Japan for women, 
at 86·9 years (86·7–87·2). In 2016, the lowest life 
expectancy at birth worldwide was in Lesotho for men, at 
47·1 years (44·6–49·7), and in the Central African 
Republic for women, at 52·6 years (48·8–56·6). Life 
expectancy at birth was greater than 80 years for women 
in 57 countries and in just 10 countries for men. Life 
expectancy at birth was less than 50 years for men and 
less than 55 in women in Lesotho and Central African 
Republic. Geographic patterns in life expectancy at age 
65 years were similarly variable. In 2016, female life 
expectancy at age 65 years was highest in Japan 
(24·2 
years, 
24·1–24·4), 
Singapore 
(23·3 
years, 
21·6–25·2), and France (23·2 years, 22·8–23·7), whereas 
male life expectancy at age 65 years was highest in Kuwait 
(19·8 
years, 
17·4–22·4), 
Singapore 
(19·7 
years, 
17·9–21·5), and Japan (19·5 years, 19·4–19·7). Life 
expectancy at age 65 years was less than 10 years for men 
in Lesotho and the Central African Republic.
Observed versus expected life expectancy
The entire GBD dataset of life expectancy at birth from 
1970 to 2016 for the 195 countries and territories, as well 
as the expected value of life expectancy as a function of 
SDI is shown in figure 6. The expected value is based on 
Figure 5: Correlation between the log of age-specific mortality rates in 1970 and (A) annualised (relative) 
rates of change and (B) absolute change, 1970–2016
Each bar represents the correlation between the log of age-specific mortality rate in 1970 and the change in the 
age-specific mortality rate from 1970 to 2016, for 195 countries and territories, by sex. Black lines represent 95% 
uncertainty intervals.

fitting of the expected pattern of age-specific mortality 
and using the expected death rates to calculate expected 
life expectancy. In addition to the strong relationship 
between life expectancy at birth and SDI (correlation of 
0·83 for men and 0·87 for women), the figure also shows 
the strong temporal shift over the decades towards higher 
life expectancies. This shift is most evident at high SDI 
and not evident at levels of SDI from 0 to 0·7 (ie, in most 
low-income and middle-income countries; appendix 
section 8 p 113).
In the most location-years, male life expectancy at birth 
was less than female life expectancy at birth (figure 7). 
The GBD estimation of sex differences in life expectancy 
shows a clear pattern of an increasing negative difference 
between male and female life expectancy as countries 
achieve higher levels of SDI. The expected difference 
between male and female life expectancy reaches a 
maximum of 6·3 years at an SDI of 0·78; above this level 
of SDI, the difference in life expectancy between men and 
women is narrower. At high SDI there were generally 
smaller differences in life expectancy in the most recent 
time periods. During the entire period of estimation and 
across all levels of SDI, there were 324 location-years of 
negative difference in which male life expectancy was 
more than 10 years lower than female life expectancy, 
including for Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania at high SDI. 
Conversely, during the entire estimation period, there 
were 1725 location-years with a positive difference 
whereby male life expectancy was higher than female 
life expectancy, although only 351 such location-years 
occurred in the most recent period, 2000–16. In 2016, the 
largest negative difference between male and female life 
expectancy at birth at the national level was in Russia, 
where male life expectancy (65·4 years, 60·8–70·7) was 
10·8 years lower than female life expectancy (76·2 years, 
71·4–80·7). In 2016, only three locations at the national 
level had an estimated male life expectancy that was 
higher than female life expectancy: Congo (Brazzaville), 
Kuwait, and Mauritania. Around the observed patterns of 
increasing and decreasing difference in life expectancy 
between men and women, there was also large variation 
in the sex differences in life expectancy within the same 
level of SDI.
Figure 8 shows the difference in observed life 
expectancy at birth and life expectancy at birth anticipated 
on the basis of SDI for men and women in 1970, 1980, 
1990, 2000, and 2016, with locations ordered by the 
average value for men and women in 2016. This difference 
quantifies how much a location exceeds the value 
expected on the basis of SDI alone. In 2016, higher than 
expected life expectancies occurred in many regions; at 
the national level, Niger, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Peru, and 
the Maldives had the largest positive differences between 
observed life expectancy and that expected in 2016. 
Negative differences—where observed life expectancy 
was below that expected on the basis of SDI—were largest 
in Lesotho, Swaziland, South Africa, the Central African 
Republic, and Fiji. Figure 8 also shows how the difference 
between observed and expected life expectancy at birth 
has changed over time. For example, the general trend in 
Costa Rica has been for increases in this difference, from 
an average difference for both sexes of 3·3 years in 1970,

the positive difference increased and life expectancy has 
remained 6 or more years higher than expected since 1980; 
whereas, in 1970, Cuba had a life expectancy 4·7 years 
higher than expected, which subsequently decreased to 
3·5 years higher than expected in 2016.
The largest increases in positive differences between 
observed and expected life expectancy during the 
period 2000–16 were achieved by Niger (7·1 years for 
women and 5·3 years for men), Senegal (3·8 years for 
women and 4·4 years for men), Timor-Leste (4·0 years

for women and 3·6 years for men), and Mali (4·0 years 
for women and 2·6 years for men). Reductions in the 
negative difference between observed and expected life 
expectancy also represent improvement. From 2000 
to 2016, notable improvements of this type occurred in 
many locations in sub-Saharan Africa, such as Botswana, 
Zimbabwe, Malawi, and Zambia, where the negative 
difference in observed and expected life expectancy at 
birth shrank by 10 or more years. Outside of sub-Saharan 
Africa, the largest decreases in negative difference over 
that period were by 6·0 years in Kazakhstan, 5·2 years in 
Laos, and 4·8 years in Estonia. National locations notable 
for progressing from having observed life expectancy 
below the level anticipated on the basis of SDI in the 
year 2000 to observed life expectancy greater than 
expected in 2016 included: Rwanda (from 7·2 years less 
than expected to 4·3 years greater than expected), 
Burundi (from 6·7 years less than expected to 2·0 years 
greater than expected), and Ethiopia (from 6·7 years less 
than expected to 5·0 years greater than expected). By 
contrast, the so-called 4C countries—China, Costa Rica, 
Cuba, and Chile—noted by the Lancet Commission on 
Investing in Health5 as exemplar locations for 
improvements in health outcomes in previous time 
periods, were notable for their comparatively slower 
success in reducing the difference from expected life 
expectancy at birth during the most recent period. 
From 2000 to 2016, the positive difference in observed 
and expected life expectancy grew slowly, increasing for 
women by 0·5 years in Costa Rica, 0·4 years in Cuba, 
and 1·1 years in Chile, and increasing for men by 
0·9 years in Costa Rica, 0·4 years in Cuba, and 1·3 years 
in Chile. Contrasting with this slower progression, the 
most recent improvements in China remained notable. 
From 1990 to 2000, the negative difference in observed 
and expected life expectancy decreased by just 0·2 years 
for women and 0·1 years for men; however, 
from 2000 to 2016, observed life expectancy in China 
exceeded the level expected on the basis of SDI for the 
first time since the 1970s, by 2·6 years for women and 
2·2 years for men.
Discussion
Main findings
Mortality rates decreased for most age groups from 2000 
to 2016, with particularly notable decreases for adolescents 
and younger adults in several world regions. From 1970 
to 2016, life expectancy at birth overall increased by 
13·5 years for men and 14·8 years for women. Over the 
past 47 years, life expectancy at birth increased in 194 of 
195 locations included in this analysis; the only decline 
observed was related to conflict in Syria. Globally, U5MR 
declined from 2000 to 2016, decreasing from 69·4 per 
1000 livebirths (67·2–71·8) to 38·4 per 1000 livebirths 
(34·5–43·1), giving an average decrease of 3·7% per year 
(3·0–4·3); of 195 countries and territories, 189 had 
declines in U5MR since 2000. In many countries, major 
increases in mortality have been followed by faster rates 
of decline in subsequent years or decades,17 leading to 
some degree of mortality rate catch-up declines for 
locations that had mortality increases. More recent 
increases in mortality in some countries8—possibly 
linked to drug use, self-harm, homicide,7 tobacco use,33 
and obesity34–36—are still occurring. As mortality has 
declined, the capacity to monitor detailed trends through 
VR systems has improved globally: in 1970, 28% of deaths 
were registered, increasing to 34% in 1990, with a peak of 
45% in 2013. Male life expectancy was generally lower

than female life expectancy in the most locations and 
time periods. Niger, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Peru, and the 
Maldives had the highest levels of observed life expectancy 
relative to the level expected in 2016 on the basis of SDI. 
Stillbirths and under-5 mortality rate
Enormous global progress has been made in reducing 
the stillbirth rate over the past 47 years, but the stillbirth 
rate varies considerably across countries and even across 
countries with similar neonatal mortality rates. The 
global trend toward reduced stillbirth rates and numbers 
could be further accelerated by addressing common 
risks—low access to antenatal car or skilled birth 
attendence and detection and treatment of maternal 
disorders during pregnancy, for example—particularly in 
countries with the highest burden of stillbirths. Although 
we provide an overall assessment of stillbirth rates, our 
understanding of trends in stillbirths is hampered by the 
inconsistent definitions used in many studies and 
national reporting. Standardised reporting in VR systems 
and in other studies would enable the future tracking 
of stillbirths. 
The number of deaths among children younger than 
5 years has declined substantially over the past 47 years, 
with rates of change accelerating in many countries since 
2000, particularly compared with the previous decade, 
1990–2000. In 2016, the number of under-5 deaths 
dropped below 5 million for the first time. This finding is 
continued evidence that progress is being made in 
tackling the key causes of child death, which is probably 
linked to successful strategies and trends, including 
increased educational levels of mothers,37,38 rising 
incomes per capita,39,40 declining levels of fertility,41–43 
scale-up of vaccination programme,44,45 mass distribution 
of insecticide-treated bednets,46–48 improved water and 
sanitation,49–51 and the impact of a wide array of other 
health programmes funded by expanded provision of 
development assistance for health.52 The multiple global 
development initiatives that have prioritised maternal 
and child health over the past four decades have also 
raised and maintained global and national policy 
attention on child mortality.3,53–56 However, trends in the 
decline of child mortality in the past decade suggest that 
the ambitious SDG targets—setting absolute levels of the 
U5MR at below 25 deaths per 1000 livebirths and a 
neonatal death rate equal to or lower than 12 deaths per 
1000 livebirths by 2030—can only be achieved if the pace 
of progress is accelerated, particularly in countries in 
sub-Saharan African such as the Central African 
Republic, Chad, Mali, and Sierra Leone. If trends seen in 
the period 2000–16 were to continue through to the year 
2030, 148 of the 195 countries in the GBD study would 
achieve the SDG U5MR target and 47 countries would 
not. Similarly, although 157 countries could achieve the 
SDG neonatal mortality target by 2030 on the basis of 
current trajectories, 38 countries would not reach this 
target. The shift in the SDGs from relative targets of a 
two-thirds reduction in the starting U5MR to an absolute 
target requires a major shift in how resources are 
allocated. Increased funding in general and prioritisation 
of support for countries that are farthest from these 
targets will be needed to accelerate progress. Enhanced 
funding of health programmes, expansion of female 
education, and continued innovation in interventions for 
child mortality reduction will likely be key parts of 
the strategy to achieve the SDG targets for child and 
neonatal mortality. 
Adolescents
The GBD 2016 results showed great variation in the 
health profiles of 10–24 year olds. Although annualised 
rates of change in mortality rates for adolescents 
decreased for most locations from 2000 to 2016, this age 
group also included some of the largest increases 
estimated for this time period, most notably for 
adolescent girls in Syria and adolescent boys in Syria, 
Yemen, Iraq, and Libya. It is during adolescence that 
inequities related to gender, poverty, and social 
disadvantage have their greatest effects,57 and this is 
reflected in the distribution of increasing annualised 
rates of change in mortality rates for this age group. 
Adolescence is a formative life stage for health and 
wellbeing.57,58 Investment in adolescent health will result 
in benefits during the adolescent and young adult years, 
healthier trajectories across the adult life course, and the 
healthiest possible start for the next generation, given 
that adolescents are the next generation to be parents. 
Unfortunately, relative to other age groups, adolescent 
health has attracted little policy attention, although 
adolescent health is central to nearly every major agenda 
in global health, including HIV
/AIDS, mental health, 
injury, maternal, newborn, and child health, and non-
communicable diseases. 
Younger adults
Our analysis shows that during 1970–2016, mortality 
rates in men aged 25–49 years increased in 32 (16%) of 
195 countries; for women in this age range, mortality 
rates increased in 18 (9%) countries. Increased mortality 
rates were more common in the earlier periods analysed, 
particularly for men; in this age group, mortality rate 
increased in 62 (32%) countries from 1980 to 1990 and 
increased in 100 (51%) countries from 1990 to 2000. For 
another subset of countries—27 (14%) countries for men 
and 55 (28%) countries for women—mortality in younger 
adults declined by at least 2% per year from 1970 to 2016. 
The enormous variability in trends in this age group 
reflects the impact of many factors that have dis-
proportionate effects on younger adults, such as conflict 
and terrorism, HIV
/AIDS,59 injuries, and alcohol-related 
or drug-related mortality.17 However, these increased 
mortality rates occurred not only among countries 
heavily affected by the HIV
/AIDS epidemic and other 
public health crises such as drug,7 tobacco,33 and alcohol

use,60 but also in countries such as the USA, Portugal, 
Nicaragua, Guam, Jamaica, and Venezuela in different 
decades, where sources of mortality increases, including 
obesity,36 diabetes,61 chronic kidney disease,62 smoking,33 
ischaemic heart disease, or cirrhosis, might be additional 
factors.63 Mortality in these age groups has been studied 
far less than mortality in children, adolescents, and the 
elderly. In light of our observations, more study and 
policy attention is justified for these age groups. 
Older adults
Whereas improvement in mortality among children 
younger than 5 years and young adults has been 
substantial (figure 3A), changes in mortality among 
people older than 65 years have been relatively small. 
A consequence of the improvements in survival at 
younger age groups over the past five decades is that 
more people are living to older adult ages. Understanding 
the levels and trends of mortality in older age groups has 
increased relevance for countries at high SDI with greater 
life expectancy and is rapidly becoming more relevant 
among countries lower on the SDI scale because of 
decreases in mortality and a decline in fertility over the 
past five decades. Life expectancy at age 65 years increased 
in almost all countries from 1970 to 2016, and these 
increases typically occurred across successive decades, a 
trend with significant implications for health care, health 
insurance, and social security systems across all levels of 
SDI. Given the large fraction of the world’s population 
that will probably survive into these age groups, more 
research and policy attention on the determinants of 
mortality and health at these ages is warranted. 
Differences between male and female mortality
For the first time, we have characterised how sex differ-
ence in life expectancy (and age-specific mortality) 
compare with the patterns expected on the basis of 
development status. The characteristic U-shaped pattern 
that we saw, in which males fall progressively behind 
females with increasing SDI until high levels of SDI 
where the gap narrows, deserves attention. Throughout 
the development process, mortality rates decline more 
slowly for men than for women across a range of SDI 
levels, from low SDI to upper-middle SDI. At high SDI, 
male progress is faster, especially in middle-aged and 
older adults, leading to a narrowing difference in life 
expectancy; the temporal shifts shown in figure 7 also 
suggest that this U-shaped curve has a more marked 
upturn over time at high SDI. The extent to which this 
narrowing gap is due to shifts in male versus female 
behaviours in settings with much more equal labour 
force participation versus risk exposure to factors such as 
tobacco deserves further analysis. 
Compensating mortality change
In analysing the rates of change in age-specific mortality, 
both over the long-term from 1970 to 2016 and by decade, 
it is notable that the two GBD super-regions in which 
many locations had increasing mortality in the 1980s and 
1990s, sub-Saharan Africa and central Europe, eastern 
Europe, and central Asia, had large decreases in 2000–16. 
This catch-up phenomenon can partly be explained as a 
regression to the mean, in which exceptional circum-
stances in a location result in increases or fast rates of 
decline in one time period that revert back to more typical 
patterns in later time periods. In addition to this 
phenomenon, however, we have found clear compen-
sating patterns after unique mortality increases: for 
example, the rise and subsequent fall in mortality as a 
consequence of ART scale-up in countries with large HIV
/
AIDS epidemics,59,64–66 as well as the rise and then fall of 
alcohol-related mortality in eastern Europe and central 
Asia.67–70 Additionally, for many locations, such as Rwanda 
or Liberia, episodes of major conflict and terrorism have 
been followed by rapid declines in mortality in the 
subsequent decade.71,72 Re 
gression to the mean and 
compensating rates of change in mortality after major 
increases result in greater consistency in long-term rates 
of change for age-specific mortality than is seen in any 
given year or decade. These compensating rates of change 
can be driven by concerted societal res 
ponse to major 
mortality reversals. As new types of adverse mortality 
events arise, such as increased mortality related to drug 
use, obesity, or chronic kidney diseases,17,62,73,74 the likely 
consequence is that, over a longer period of obser 
vation, 
there will be a concerted societal response to counter these 
effects. This likely mechanism will also be an important 
factor in assessing the long-term impact of emerging 
mortality threats such as food insecurity stemming from 
climate change. 
Convergence
The Lancet Commission on Investing in Health5 called 
for a “grand convergence” in health, through the elimi-
nation of global inequalities in mortality rates. This 
vision was instrumental in the call by the governments of 
the USA, India, and Ethiopia to end preventable maternal 
and child death in a generation. These efforts were 
central to the development of the absolute targets for 
U5MR and neonatal mortality rate set in SDG goal 3. 
More generally, however, assessments of convergence in 
the research literature on mortality inequalities have 
focused on relative measures, such as the ratio of the 
death rates in the top quintile of SDI to those in the 
bottom quintile.5,75–78 In order for ratios of death rates 
between the worst off and best off to narrow, the worst off 
need to have faster, not slower, rates of decline. We found 
that convergence, when measured as the relative change 
in death rates, has occurred for children aged 1–4 years, 
adolescents, and young people, and for men older than 
55 years; however, there has been relative divergence for 
women and men aged 30–54 years, as well as for women 
through to age 84 years. When convergence is assessed 
in terms of the absolute difference in death rates, the

findings are much more positive, showing clear con-
vergence in all age groups. Although relative conver-
gence is a high bar, it is not impossible, as shown by the 
progress achieved in some age groups. The potential 
for mortality to be reduced through access to high-
quality personal health care and through population-level 
modification of risk factors means that this divergence 
is not necessarily inevitable.79–85 More atten 
tion on 
how even faster progress can be made in the worst-off
 
places will be needed to achieve convergence in relative 
death rates. 
New generation of exemplars
In the 1980s, the book Good Health at Low Cost86 called 
attention to the notable levels of health achieved in 
several lower-income locations: China, Cuba, Costa Rica, 
Sri Lanka, and the Indian state Kerala. Nearly 30 years 
later, this assessment was updated by Balabanova and 
colleagues,87 who highlighted Bangladesh, Ethiopia, 
Kyrgyzstan, Thailand, and the Indian state Tamil Nadu, 
while the Lancet Commission on Investing in Health5 
called attention to what has been called the 4C countries 
(China, Cuba, Costa Rica, and Chile). Identification of 
exemplars is important because examination of these 
countries can identify successful policy strategies or 
leadership approaches. In our analysis comparing ob-
served life expectancy to that expected on the basis of 
SDI alone, some of the locations previously identified as 
success stories do not stand out to the same degree 
in 2016. Across 371 locations, ranked by the differ-
ence between observed and expected life expectancy, 
Cuba ranked 58th, China 104th, Kyrgyzstan 233rd, 
Thailand 62nd, Kerala 74th, and Tamil Nadu 264th. By 
contrast, countries such as Niger, Nicaragua, Peru, 
The Gambia, Nepal, and Ethiopia are low-SDI to middle-
SDI nations that rank 1st, 2nd, 6th, 13th, 18th, and 19th, 
respectively. When the assessment is extended to look at 
which countries have improved the gap between ob-
served and expected life expectancy the most since the 
year 2000, the top five countries include Botswana, 
Zimbabwe, Rwanda, Malawi, and Zambia; in four of 
these countries, the scale-up of ART played a crucial role 
in the recent progress. Among countries where observed 
life expect 
ancy minus expected life expectancy was 
greater than 5 years in 2016, the locations with the 
largest gains since 2000 were, in order, Ethiopia, Niger, 
Portugal, Peru, and the Maldives. The policies and 
leadership strategies of these countries should be 
studied in more depth to see whether consistent 
messages that are relevant to other countries can be 
identified. Our quantified approach of directly com-
paring expected life expectancy with that anticipated on 
the basis of SDI provides a more rigorous assessment of 
which countries have achieved the most impressive 
improvements in life expectancy that are not explained 
by income per capita, educational attainment, or fertility 
decline. Some of the differences in our assessment from 
past efforts such as Good Health at Low Cost might be 
related to the use of SDI instead of GDP per capita 
because it removes from the assessment countries with 
higher life expectancy related to early investment in 
educational attainment. Education, especially education 
of young girls,88–90 is a powerful driver of health 
improvement, and our identification of countries that 
have performed well while controlling for SDI should 
not be taken as evidence to the contrary. 
Measurement challenges
In our analysis, we estimated that 80 countries have civil 
registration systems that capture more than 95% of 
deaths in the most recent year with available data. The 
number of countries with VR systems capturing more 
than 95% of deaths increased from 57 in 1970 to a peak of 
76 in 2012. The fraction of global deaths that are 
registered has increased from 28% to a peak of 45% over 
the past 47 years. Progress made on VR has been larger 
than previously appreciated.91 The increased coverage of 
death registration is good news, and suggests that further 
accelerated progress might be possible. The rapid 
increase in coverage in China is particularly encourag-
ing. However, some countries have stagnated, with 
VR completeness remaining stubbornly in the range of 
70–90%. Several new initiatives have been launched to 
strengthen civil registration, such as the Bloomberg Data 
for Health Initiative and the World Bank Global 
Financing Facility for Maternal and Child Health, 
which include VR systems to monitor progress.92 These 
efforts to strengthen registration will hopefully improve 
the precision of age-specific mortality estimates by 
reduc 
ing the dependency of the GBD study and various 
national monitoring efforts on model life tables and 
other statistical modelling. The annual assessment of 
VR completeness from the GBD studies can provide a 
mechanism to evaluate progress on this important 
global agenda. 
In the GBD assessment, we have not used U5MR to 
predict adult mortality rates or age-specific mortality 
rates directly in places without empirical mortality data 
from civil registration. Instead, we have depended on 
sibling history data collected through household surveys 
and Bayesian statistical models that incorporate key 
covariates, including lag-distributed income per capita, 
educational attainment, and HIV
/AIDS mortality, which 
affect all-cause mortality. The relationship between 
under-5 mortality and adult mortality in our results has 
remained generally weak over the past five decades. This 
generally weak relationship should not be surprising, 
especially in the past two decades, given the focused 
investments in child health and the development of 
effective interventions for child health. More importantly, 
this weak relationship highlights the problems of using 
child death rates as the main driver to predict adult 
mortality, and thus the full age pattern of mortality, as is 
the practice for UNPD15 and USCB11 estimation.93

Our estimates of mortality in locations with ongoing 
conflict and terrorism, such as in Syria or Yemen, are 
limited by data that are generally not validated and are 
based on eyewitness recall and by the sparseness of data 
on indirect sources of mortality during conflict and 
terrorism, such as poor access to health care, famine, or 
epidemic diseases that affect civilian populations. The 
direction of the bias for these types of sources is 
unknown. In the GBD we have made substantial use of 
the Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCPD) database, 
which records the range of estimates for many conflicts. 
The UCPD database, however, does not provide detailed 
information on the source of the estimate for each event. 
In future work, we hope to collaborate with groups that 
track conflicts and disasters to more precisely characterise 
the nature of the source for each event. 
Comparison of GBD 2016 to other estimates
The Research in context panel summarises the main 
changes between GBD 2015 and GBD 2016. Substantial 
correlation exists between GBD 2016 stillbirth results 
and those published by the Stillbirth Epidemiology 
Investigator Group (SEIG);94,95 where results differed the 
most, the probable explanation is related to variation in 
modelling strategies. The unified modelling strategy 
used by GBD, which includes methods developed to 
account for non-sampling biases from different data 
sources, supports the estimation of an internally 
consistent time series of levels and rates for stillbirths 
across locations; a comparison between modelling 
strategies for SEIG and GBD and resulting estimates is 
shown in the appendix (section 8 p 74).
Previous estimates of U5MR from the UN Interagency 
Group for Child Mortality (IGME) have been broadly 
similar to those produced by GBD,94 and the most recent 
estimates from IGME are strongly correlated (Pearson 
correlation 0·982, p<0·0001) with those of GBD 2016 
(appendix section 8 p 72). However, country-level 
disparities in estimation are evident and this results in 
notable differences in the assessment of progress toward 
achieving SDG targets.96,97 Figure 9 shows substantial 
differences in life expectancy at birth as assessed for 2015 
by the GBD 2016 study compared with estimates from 
WHO, UNPD, and USCB. For higher SDI countries, 
particularly those with complete VR systems, the 
differences are less notable. The WHO estimates of life 
expectancy differed from GBD estimates by more than 
5 years for 28 countries; UNPD estimates differed by 
more than 5 years from the GBD 2016 estimates in 23 
countries for men and 21 countries for women; USCB 
estimates differed from those of GBD 2016 by more than 
5 years in 35 countries for men and 31 countries for 
women. Such large differences in a summary measure of 
mortality suggest even more greater differences for age-
specific mortality. The USCB and WHO release summary 
measures such as life expectancy at birth, U5MR, 
and adult mortality rates, but not for more detailed 
disaggregation of age groups over a long time series. 
WHO, UNPD, and USCB do not follow GATHER for 
their analyses of all-cause mortality, which limits the 
ability to understand the basis of these differences. The 
UNPD and USCB predict adult mortality from under-5 
mortality in many lower-SDI countries, which might be a 
contributing factor. The UNPD and USCB use model life 
table systems based on a set of life tables collected 
before 1980; there are many reasons to expect that 
these mortality patterns are not relevant to the current 
period.96,97
Limitations
Although this study includes many methodological 
advances, it also has limitations. First, the accuracy of the 
estimates depends crucially on the available data sources 
and density of data by time period. For child mortality, at 
least one year of data was available for all countries. For 
adults, however, there were 12 countries with no data; in 
these cases, estimates depend critically on covariates and 
the ST-GPR statistical model. Additionally, for country-
years with input data, data quality, as determined by both 
sampling and non-sampling errors, varies across 
locations and over time within the same location. This 
adds to the uncertainty in comparing the same metric 
from different locations, even though we have made 
every effort to systematically propagate uncertainty 
throughout our estimation process. Second, for many 
countries with limited or absent VR systems, particularly 
in sub-Saharan Africa, we use sibling history data to 
estimate levels and trends in adult mortality. Sibling 
history data have several known biases.17,22,98 In settings 
outside of sub-Saharan Africa we found no net biases in 
our estimates based on sibling histories when compared 
with equivalent estimates derived from other sources of 
information such as VR systems. Although differences 
in adoption practices in parts of sub-Saharan Africa 
create the potential for sibling histories to perform 
differently than in other settings, Obermeyer and 
colleagues,25 
Helleringer 
and 
colleagues,98 
and 
Masquelier99 did not find a consistent direction of bias in 
sibling history data in these settings. Third, our 
assessment of mortality depends on the validity of our 
modelling of HIV
/AIDS epidemics, particularly in 
settings such as in eastern and southern sub-Saharan 
Africa, which have large generalised epidemics. While 
there are relatively robust data available on the prevalence 
of HIV
/AIDS from population-based surveys in many of 
these countries, such data are often available only for 
selected years, and the data on HIV
/AIDS-specific 
mortality and CD4 progression rates, both on and off
 
ART, are far more scarce. Death rates on ART by 
CD4 count are also confounded by other indications for 
ART such as the presence of opportunistic infections.100–102 
All combined, there is a much higher level of uncertainty 
in the HIV
/AIDS-specific mortality estimates than in all-
cause mortality estimation and these are used as a key

covariate in the estimation of all-cause mortality. Fourth, 
there is significant challenge in the synthesis of stillbirth 
mortality across countries, because the definition of 
stillbirth varies over time and across countries. We 
include a fixed effect on the definition of stillbirth with a 
no definition category. Bias adjustment for data from this 
definition category is done with the adjustment factor 
used by Blencowe and colleagues.23 Although this 
situation is not ideal, it does help us to generate estimates 
for countries in central Asia where no definition of 
stillbirth is provided in the data that we have. Fifth, in 
this assessment we use the UNPD estimates of 
population by age, sex, and year in 150 countries. 
However, in years far from a census, these estimates of 
population are affected by the UNPD estimates of 
mortality, which differ from the GBD estimates; where 
UNPD mortality estimates are lower than those from 
GBD, population estimates will be larger and GBD 
mortality might be underestimated. In future assess-
ments, it would be preferable to develop estimates of 
population that are fully consistent with GBD estimates 
of age-specific mortality and the GBD 2016 assessment of 
age-specific fertility. Sixth, estimating the mortality 
envelope for the 95 years and older age group presents a 
challenge. Our estimated population in this age group 
might be biased due to the potential underestimation or 
overestimation of the number of 79 year olds in the 
interpolated UNPD population estimates; the estimated 
mortality rate itself might be biased depending on the 
population structure in this age group; and availability of 
empirical data on mortality in this age group may be low. 
A more rigorous analytical framework of population 
estimation needs to be applied in the future to improve 
accuracy. Seventh, we used ST-GPR in our current study 
to estimate TFR with all available data on TFR from 
surveys, censuses, and civil registration systems. By 
using informative covariates including income and 
education, our current estimates are likely to reflect the 
level and trends of fertility in periods for which we have 
sparse data and that are further away from available 
censuses. However, our current model for TFR is 
separate from the demographic estimation process of 
mortality, migration, and population, and it is likely to 
have induced internal inconsistency among the key 
components of the demographic balancing equation. 
Combined with use of the age pattern of fertility from 
World Population Prospects 2015 revision, our current 
birth estimates might be biased in data-sparse locations, 
even though we provide a 95% UI. Eighth, data 
availability assessed for GBD 2016 peaks in 2013. Fewer 
data are available for subsequent years because of lags in 
reporting of vital statistics and lags in the collation, 
analysis, and publication of household surveys. Estimates 
for more recent years are increasingly model-dependent. 
Ninth, we have yet to propagate uncertainty of estimated 
completeness of VR system into our all-cause mor-
tality estimation process because of constraints in 
computation. Currently, we only adjust mortality rate 
from VR systems if the estimated completeness is 
below 95%. This dichotomous approach, however, could 
generate rather substantial changes in the age-specific 
mortality if the estimated completeness is just under the 
95% threshold. In the case of South Korea, for example, 
our estimated completeness is 0·1% below 95%, which 
results in a 5·4% increase in the age-specific mortality 
that we have used. Such instability needs to be eliminated 
in future iterations of GBD. Tenth, migration, both 
domestic and international, should have a substantial 
impact on estimated mortality in certain locations. 
However, our input data on mortality, fertility, and 
population might not have fully considered the impact of 
migration. VR systems and disease surveillance systems

are likely to omit deaths from migrants, domestic or 
international. Given the quality and quantity of available 
data on migration, long-term investment to improve the 
quality of VR and civil registration systems is essential. 
Eleventh, our assessment of SDI is based on mean levels 
of income per capita, educational attainment, and the 
total fertility rate. We do not take into account the 
distribution of each of these quantities within each 
country or location. In future work, it would be desirable 
to explore distribution-sensitive measures of SDI. Finally, 
our current study only provides subnational estimates 
for countries with populations higher than 200 million. 
Further detailed subnational analysis will be incorporated 
in future iterations of GBD as necessary data become 
available. 
Future directions
For this GBD 2016, we used a systematic analysis of 
fertility data to estimate TFR and annual birth numbers; 
our assessment has, however, continued to use the 
UNPD estimates of relative age pattern of fertility by the 
age of the mother. We plan to explore the empirical 
evidence in each age group and location for maternal age 
patterns of fertility. More importantly, for this study we 
used the UNPD estimates of population by age and sex. 
These estimates, especially in years that are further away 
from a high-quality census, are dependent on their 
estimates of age-specific mortality, fertility in previous 
years, and migration. GBD estimates of mortality are 
quite different, and in some locations our fertility 
estimates were also quite different, leading to potential 
inconsistencies between UNPD population estimates 
and the implied GBD estimates of population. For GBD 
2017, we plan to develop estimates of age-specific 
population that are internally consistent with GBD 
estimates of fertility and mortality. 
Conclusion
Understanding comparative mortality levels in different 
population subgroups, and how they are changing, has 
enormous implications for policy. Our results tracking 
mortality rates in 195 countries and territories over 
47 years, suggest that progress is being made in 
improving survival rates; however, in some populations, 
that progress has been slow. This slow progress is 
particularly the case for young adult males, for whom the 
leading causes of death are largely preventable, but it is 
also evident at older adult ages where the return on the 
comprehensive public health and disease control 
strategies of the past few decades is less evident. 
Moreover, although massive declines in the risk of child 
mortality since 1970 have led to substantial gains in life 
expectancy at birth, they have done little to accelerate the 
relative convergence of mortality levels in populations, 
which is now increasingly driven by premature adult 
death. Our findings also make evident the fact that some 
of the exemplar countries that were at the vanguard of 
mortality declines over the last 25 years of the 
20th century, particularly in terms of child mortality, 
have been surpassed in terms of recent successes. In 
2016, survival prospects in populations as diverse as 
Ethiopia, Niger, Portugal, Peru, and the Maldives have 
increased substantially, and these countries now top the 
list in terms of the magnitude of overall improvement 
since 2000. Learning from such successes, making the 
detection changes in mortality patterns more reliable, 
and use of that information to more extensively guide 
health and social policy should accelerate further declines 
in mortality, particularly in populations where progress 
remains modest.
