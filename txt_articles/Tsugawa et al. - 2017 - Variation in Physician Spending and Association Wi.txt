IMPORTANCE While the substantial variation in health care spending across regions and
hospitals is well known, key clinical decisions are ultimately made by physicians. However,
the degree to which spending varies across physicians and the clinical consequences of that
variation are unknown.
OBJECTIVE To investigate variation in spending across physicians and its association with
patient outcomes.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS For this retrospective data analysis, we analyzed a 20%
random sample of Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries 65 years and older who were
hospitalized with a nonelective medical condition and treated by a general internist between
January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2014. We first quantified the proportion of variation in
Medicare Part B spending attributable to hospitals, physicians, and patients. We then
examined the association between physician spending and patient outcomes, adjusted for
patient and physician characteristics and hospital fixed effects (effectively comparing
physicians within the same hospital). Our primary analysis focused on hospitalist physicians,
whose patients are plausibly quasirandomized within a hospital based on physician work
schedule. A secondary analysis focused on general internists overall. To ensure that patient
illness severity did not directly affect physician spending estimates, we calculated physicians’
spending levels in 2011 through 2012 and examined outcomes of their patients in 2013 and
2014.
EXPOSURES Physicians’adjusted Part B spending level in 2011 through 2012.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Patients’30-day mortality and readmission rates in 2013
and 2014.
RESULTS To determine the amount of variation across physicians we included 485 016
hospitalizations treated by 21 963 physicians at 2837 acute care hospitals for the analysis of
hospitalists and 839 512 hospitalizations treated by 50 079 physicians at 3195 acute care
hospitals for the analysis of general internists. Variation in spending across physicians within
hospital was larger than variation across hospitals (for hospitalists, 8.4% across physicians vs
7.0% across hospitals; for general internists, 10.5% across physicians vs 6.2% across
hospitals). Higher physician spending was not associated with lower 30-day mortality
(adjusted odds ratio [aOR] for additional $100 in physician spending, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.98-1.01;
P = .47) or readmissions (aOR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.99-1.01; P = .54) for hospitalists within the
same hospital. We observed similar patterns among general internists.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Health care spending varies more across individual physicians
than across hospitals. However, higher physician spending is not associated with better
outcomes of hospitalized patients. Our findings suggest policies targeting both physicians
and hospitals may be more effective in reducing wasteful spending than policies focusing
solely on hospitals.

T
he substantial variation in spending and quantity of
health care services across US regions, as well as among
hospitalswithinthesamecommunity,arewellknown.1-8
Findingsontheclinicalimplicationsofthisvariationaremixed,
but most suggest that greater health care spending does not
reliably translate into better patient outcomes.9-17 Decisions
on utilization of health care services, are ultimately made by
frontline clinicians and not by regions or hospitals.6-8 How-
ever, the degree to which utilization decisions by individual
physicians vary within regions and hospitals, and the clinical
implications of that variation, are unknown.
While regional culture and hospital capabilities surely in-
fluence patient treatment, individual physicians are increas-
ingly recognized as critical contributors to the observed varia-
tion in health care services.6-8 Physicians make key decisions
aboutadmittinganddischargingpatients,orderingimagingand
diagnostic tests, engaging consultants, and referring for pro-
cedures. Despite the central importance of physicians in de-
termining medical spending, we know surprisingly little about
how much their utilization behavior varies within the same
hospital. Even more importantly, we have almost no data on
whether higher-spending physicians within the same hospi-
tal have meaningfully better patient outcomes. While some
studies have profiled physician spending for specific condi-
tions, they have not examined associations with patient out-
comes or analyzed nationally representative data.18-21
WeusedanationalsampleofMedicarebeneficiarieshospi-
talizedwithamedicalconditionfromJanuary1,2011,toDecem-
ber 31, 2014, and treated by a hospitalist or general internist to
answer 3 questions. First, how much variation in spending ex-
istsacrossindividualphysicianswithinthesamehospitalcom-
pared to variation in spending across hospitals? Second, what
characteristics of physicians are associated with higher spend-
ing? Third, what is the relationship between physician-level
spending and 30-day patient mortality and readmissions?
Methods
This study was approved by the Harvard Medical School in-
stitutional review board, and patient consent was not re-
quired.
Data Source and Study Sample
We linked 4 data sources: the 100% Medicare Inpatient Files
(2011-2014), 20% Medicare Carrier Files (2011-2014), Ameri-
canHospitalAssociation(AHA)annualsurveyonhospitalchar-
acteristics, and a comprehensive physician database as-
sembled by Doximity, which is an online professional network
for physicians whose data have been used in previous studies
(additional details about the database, including its
validation,22-24 are provided in the Supplement).

Key Points
Question How much does health care spending vary across
physicians within the same hospital, and do higher-spending
physicians achieve better patient outcomes?
Findings In this retrospective data analysis, health care spending
varied more across individual physicians than across hospitals.
Among hospitalized patients, higher physician spending was not
associated with lower 30-day mortality or 30-day readmissions.
Meaning Policies targeting both hospitals and physicians may be
more effective in reducing wasteful spending than policies
focusing on hospitals alone.

component of imaging incorporated in the Part A payment. In
other words, some variation in spending that is attributable to
physician decisions that we do not measure because it is in-
corporated in Part A spending, such as inpatient imaging and
laboratory tests, is likely to be correlated with variation in Part
B spending.
To avoid unstable estimates of physician spending, we re-
stricted our sample to physicians with at least 10 observed hos-
pitalizations in 2011 and 2012. Because we used a 20% sample
of Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries and because Medi-
care fee-for-service beneficiaries account for 27% of all hos-
pitalizations (including non-Medicare) in the United States,31
the requirement of at least 10 hospitalizations to be included
is equivalent to an annual threshold of 90 hospitalizations.
Extrapolating from the average number of Medicare fee-
for-service patients that physicians in our sample treated, the
average number of total patients that physicians in our analy-
ses treated annually is approximately 250. We restricted our
sample to hospitalizations with both admission and dis-
charge dates in 2011 and 2012, to ensure that we observed all
spendingforagivenhospitalization.Additionaldetailsarepro-
vided in the Supplement.

medical training (allopathic vs osteopathic).
Statistical Analysis
First, using data on hospitalizations in 2011 and 2012 treated
by hospitalists and also by general internists (including both
hospitalists and nonhospitalist internists), we analyzed how
the variation in spending across individual physicians within
hospital compared with variation across hospitals. We fit a
cross-classified multilevel model and partitioned total vari-
ance in spending into 3 levels: hospital-, physician-, and hos-
pitalization-levelvariation.Across-classifiedmultilevelmodel
allows us to partition total variation into different levels, even
when physicians (lower-level units) are not nested within hos-
pitals (higher-level units) (ie, physicians may practice in mul-
tiple hospitals).33-36 We report variance partition coefficients
and interunit reliability (IUR). The variance partition coeffi-
cients describe the proportion of total variance explained by
each level of the model hierarchy.37 For example, a variance
partition coefficient of 10% for physicians indicates that 10%
of total variation in spending can be explained by differences
in practice patterns between physicians, after accounting for
variation at the hospital level. The IUR, which takes a value be-
tween0and1,assessesthedegreetowhichtheobservedvaria-
tion among physicians is due to true differences in physician
practice patterns rather than random noise.38 An IUR close to
1 suggests that a physician who is classified as high-spending
in one year is likely to be classified as high-spending in sub-
sequent years, whereas an IUR close to 0 indicates that a phy-
sician categorized as high-spending in one year is likely attrib-
utable to random variation in patient mix.
Second, we investigated physician characteristics associ-
ated with higher physician spending.
Last, we examined the association between average physi-
cian spending and 30-day mortality and readmissions, using 2
multivariablelogisticregressionmodels.Model1adjustedforpa-
tientcharacteristicsandhospitalfixedeffects,effectivelyevalu-
ating the relationship between physician spending and patient

ureofthelikelihoodmaximizationalgorithmtoconvergeforlo-
gistic regression models, we combined MS-DRG codes that had
nodeathorreadmissionintoclinicallysimilarcategories.39Stan-
dard errors were clustered at the physician level.40
Given that unobservable patient characteristics that influ-
ence outcomes may vary systematically across physicians with
different spending levels even within the same hospital, we fo-
cused our primary analysis on hospitalist physicians and a sen-
sitivity analysis among general internists (including hospitalist
and nonhospitalist internists). Hospitalists typically work in
scheduledblocks,41andtherefore,withinthesamehospital,pa-
tientstreatedbyhospitalistsmayplausiblybequasirandomized

assessedthevalidityofourquasirandomizationassumptionby
testing the balance of patient characteristics across quartiles
ofhospitalistphysicianspending(detailsaboutidentificationof
hospitalists are provided in the Supplement). Furthermore, to
preventseverityofillnessofpatientsfromdirectlyaffectingaphy-
sician’

s spending pat-
tern using 2011 and 2012 data, and then examined the associa-
tion between that categorization of physician spending and
patientoutcomesusing2013and2014data.Usingthisapproach,
patients from different years were used to measure physicians’
spendinglevelandpatientoutcomes,andassumingseverityfluc-
tuations for a physician are independent across different years,
there are no correlated effects to introduce confounding.
Sensitivity Analyses
We conducted several sensitivity analyses. First, we repeated
analyses using total spending (sum of Part A and B spending)
instead of Part B spending, to test whether our findings were
sensitive to how we defined physician spending. Second, to
evaluate whether our findings were sensitive to how we attrib-
uted patients to physicians, we tested 2 alternative attribution

estnumberofevaluationandmanagementclaimsand(2)attrib-
uting patients to physicians who billed the first evaluation and

quartile compared with the lowest ($1055 vs $743 per hospi-
talization) (Table 2). We found that higher-spending physi-
cians were slightly older and more likely to be female than
lower-spending physicians.
Physician Spending and Patient Mortality
To examine the association between physician spending and
patient outcomes, our primary analysis included 346 613 hos-
pitalizations treated by 13 833 hospitalists (after restricting the
sample to physicians treating 10 or more hospitalizations in
2011-2012 and excluding observations with missing covariate
data).Amonghospitalists,patientcharacteristics,includingde-
mographics,comorbidconditions,andprimarydiagnosis,were
largely similar across adjusted physician-level spending quar-
tiles (Table 2).
The overall 30-day mortality rate was 11.0%. We ob-
served no association between physician spending and mor-
tality (Figure 2). An additional $100 in physician spending was
associated with an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of mortality of
0.99 (95% CI, 0.98-1.00; P = .09) (Table 3). This relationship
remained qualitatively unchanged after additional adjust-
ment for physician characteristics (aOR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.98-
1.01, P = .47).
Physician Spending and Patient Readmissions
Among 342 037 hospitalizations treated by 13 870 hospital-
ists, the overall 30-day readmission rate was 14.5%. We ob-
served no systematic association between physician-level
spending and readmission rates of patients after adjustment
for patient characteristics and hospital fixed effects (aOR, 1.00;
95% CI, 0.99-1.01, P = .93) or additional adjustment for phy-
sician characteristics (aOR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.99-1.01, P = .54)
(Figure 2) (Table 3).
Sensitivity Analyses
Our findings were robust to sensitivity analyses: using total
spending instead of Part B spending for calculating physician-
level spending; alternative methods for attributing patients to
physicians;usingdifferentmethodsfortreatingoutliercases;re-
stricting analysis to physicians treating 30 or more hospitaliza-
tions;incorporatingspendingonpatientswhoweretransferred
to other acute care hospitals; excluding patients with cancer or
dischargedtohospice;additionaladjustmentforLOS;repeating
analyses among general internists overall; and stratified analy-
sis by primary diagnosis (eTables 3-11 in the Supplement).
Discussion
Using national data on hospitalized Medicare beneficiaries, we
found a wide variation in risk-adjusted, standardized spending
across individual physicians practicing within the same hospi-
tal.Infact,between-physicianvariationinspendingwithinhos-
pital was larger, if not larger, than between-hospital variation.
However, we observed no association between a physician’
s
spending level and patient outcomes (30-day mortality and re-
admissions)withinthesamehospital.Takentogether,thesefind-
ingssuggestthatnotonlydoesphysicianspendingvarysubstan-
tiallyevenwithinthesamehospital,butalsothathigher-spending
physicians do not reliably achieve better patient outcomes.
Policy efforts to improve the efficiency of health care
should focus on units of observation where key decisions are
made, ie, physicians and hospitals.6-8 While both physicians
and hospitals are important in determining efficiency of health
care, federal efforts to improve the quality and value of inpa-
tient care to date, such as hospital value-based purchasing and
penalties for 30-day readmissions, have focused on hospi-
tals, implicitly assuming that hospitals can shape individual
physician behavior.43 However much this is true, given that
our findings demonstrate a large variation in spending across
physicians practicing in the same hospital, policy interven-
tions may be made more effective by not only targeting hos-
pitals but by narrowing the focus to practice patterns of indi-
vidual physicians.
To this point, under the Medicare Access and Children’
s
Health Insurance Program (CHIP) Reauthorization Act
(MACRA),44 most physicians will be measured and compen-
sated on the basis of performance, 2 domains of which will be
cost and quality of care. While evidence is limited as to how
variation in physician spending relates to quality of care or pa-
tient outcomes, we found that for 30-day mortality and read-
missions, physician-level spending is unrelated to patient out-
comes. Our findings suggest that higher-spending physicians
may be able to reduce resource use without compromising pa-
tient outcomes. Policy interventions that target physicians
within hospitals (eg, physician-level pay-for-performance pro-
grams and reporting of how resource use of each physician
compares with other physicians within the same hospital)
should be developed and evaluated.
Limitations
Our study has limitations. First, we calculated physician-level
estimates of Part B spending based on a limited number of hos-
pitalizations per physician. Although we demonstrated the ro-
bustnessofourfindingstoalargerthresholdnumberofcasesand

Conclusions
We found substantial variation in spending across physicians
practicing within the same hospital that exceeded variation in
spending across hospitals. Among both hospitalists and gen-
eral internists, physicians with higher spending per hospital-
ization had no detectable differences in 30-day mortality or
readmissionscomparedwithlower-spendingphysicianswithin
the same hospital. Given larger variation in spending across
physicians than across hospitals, policies that target physi-
cianswithinhospitalsmaybemoreeffectiveinreducingwaste-
ful spending than policies focusing solely on hospitals.

Editor's Note
HEALTH CARE POLICY AND LAW
Physician Spending and Patient Outcomes
Gregory Curfman, MD
Across the nation, spending on health care varies widely by
geographic location. Differences in health care expenditures
have been carefully documented over the past 2 decades in the
Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care,1 a treasure trove of data on
variations in Medicare spending and the implications for US
health care policy.
In 2009, per capita health care spending among the states
varied from $5924 in Texas to $9278 in Massachusetts, and the
percentage of gross state product allocated to health care var-
ied from 13% in Texas to 22.4% in Maine. Spending also var-
ied according to hospital re-
ferral region. For example, in
Boston, Massachusetts, aver-
age Medicare reimburse-
mentperenrolleein2009was$11 263,whilejustover100miles
awayinLebanon,NewHampshire,averagereimbursementwas
27% lower at $8270.
Because prices for medical services are set by Medicare,
variations in spending generally reflect differences in utiliza-
tion of medical services, not differences in prices. Further-
more, the wide variations in spending are not reflected in
meaningful differences in health outcomes. New research has
shown that per capita spending on health care varies as much
within private health insurance as it does within Medicare, but
in contrast to Medicare, variation in the level of spending in
private insurance is due largely to differences in prices.2
Inthisissue,Tsugawaetal3 analyzespendingbyindividual

pitalistspracticingwithinthesamehospital.Toprofileeachphy-
sician’

ThenewdataonphysicianspendinginMedicarealignwith
previous data on geographic variation in spending. Higher
spending (reflecting greater utilization of health care ser-
vices) did not translate into better health outcomes. From this
study, we can conclude that differences in the utilization of
health care services among hospitalists are not associated with
differences in clinical outcomes, adding to the growing body
of fascinating research on the complex relationship between
spending and health.
