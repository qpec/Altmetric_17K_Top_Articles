Abstract
The purpose of this study to examine support for indoor
tanning policies and correlates of policy support among
young adult women who indoor tan. Non-Hispanic white
women ages 18–30 who indoor tanned in the past year
(n = 356, M 23.3 age, SD 3.1) recruited in the Washington,
DC area from 2013 to 2016 completed measures of indoor
tanning behaviors, attitudes, perceptions, beliefs, and
policy support. Most women in the sample supported
policies to prevent children under the age of 18 from
indoor tanning (74.0 %) and stronger warnings about the
risks of indoor tanning on tanning devices (77.6 %); only
10.1 % supported a total ban. In multivariable analyses,
support for individual indoor tanning policies varied by
demographics (e.g., age), frequent indoor tanning be-
havior, indoor tanning beliefs, and risk perceptions. Non-
Hispanic white young adult women who indoor tan, the
primary consumers of indoor tanning, and a high-risk
population, largely support indoor tanning prevention
policies implemented by many state governments and
those currently under review for national enactment. Giv-
en low levels of support for a total indoor tanning ban,
support for other potential policies (e.g., increasing the
minimum age to 21) should be investigated to inform
future steps to reduce indoor tanning and the associated
health risks.

INTRODUCTION
Skin cancer is the most common malignancy in the
USA where an estimated 3.5 million cases of non-
melanoma skin cancer and 75,000 cases of melanoma
are diagnosed each year [1]. Although most skin can-
cer is preventable by reducing ultraviolet (UV) radia-
tion exposure, the incidence has increased in recent
decades, an estimated 9,000 deaths occur each year
due to melanoma, and the total costs of skin cancer
treatment exceed $8 billion annually [1].
While sunlight is a primary source of UV radiation
exposure, intentional indoor tanning accounts for an
estimated 10 % of annual skin cancer cases in the USA
[2]. Meta-analyses indicate that any lifetime indoor
tanning increases the risks of non-melanoma skin can-
cer by 29–67 % and melanoma by approximately
20 %, and these risks are increased with greater indoor
tanning exposure [3, 4]. Despite modest declines in
the prevalence of indoor tanning in the USA recently,
indoor tanning remains prevalent among non-
Hispanic white women 18 to 30 years of age [5].
Within this group nearly 30 % indoor tan each year
and an estimated 15 % tan frequently (i.e., ten or more
times) each year [6, 7], making young adults and white
women the primary consumers of indoor tanning and
a high-risk population.
Many state governments have taken action to ad-
dress this public health concern by enacting policies
intended to limit indoor tanning, primarily policies
restricting indoor tanning access for minors under
the age of 18. As of 2015, more than 40 states have
such policies in place, but the strength of policies
varies widely as does their enforcement. Eleven states
and the District Columbia banned indoor tanning
among minors under age 18 [8], while other states

Implications
Researchers or research: In the future, as addi-
tional regulations are potentially considered to pre-
vent indoor tanning and reduce the associated bur-
den of skin cancer research can inform this process
by ascertaining support for specific policies under
consideration among key consumer groups.
Practitioners or practice: For public health prac-
titioners, our data on the correlates of policy sup-
port can also help them to craft communications
about policies including those conveying informa-
tion about the potential risks of indoor tanning.
Policymakers or policy: For policymakers, these
findings can potentially inform FDA’s decision-
making as the recently proposed regulations are
finalized to consider regulations that would be ac-
ceptable to consumers.

 require indoor tanning retail facilities to provide con-
sumers with information about the potential risks of
tanning and parental permission requirements for
minors [9]. Evidence suggests stronger state-level in-
door tanning prevention policies (i.e., minimum age
vs. parental permission requirements) are associated
with reduced prevalence of indoor tanning among
adolescent females [9]. This suggests uniform policies
at the national level could help to prevent indoor
tanning behavior.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently
issued new regulations reclassifying indoor tanning
devices from class I (low to moderate risk) to class II
(moderate to high risk) medical devices. The new
regulations put into place additional premarket review
requirements for manufacturers seeking to introduce
new indoor tanning devices to the market, and require
all indoor tanning devices to conspicuously display a
“black box” warning stating they should not be used
by minors under 18 years of age [10]. In December
2015, FDA issued additional proposed rules including
a national minimum age requirement of 18 years of
age to indoor tan, requirements that adults who indoor
tan in retail settings (e.g., tanning salons) must sign a
statement acknowledging the risks, specifications for
the display of required warning labels on tanning
devices, and additional device requirements (e.g., bulb
regulations) [11].
The 2014 Surgeon General’s “Call to Action to
Prevent Skin Cancer” emphasized that indoor tanning
prevention is critical to achieve national skin cancer
prevention goals [1]. As in other areas of cancer pre-
vention and control (e.g., tobacco control), indoor
tanning prevention policies can play an important role
in reducing the public health burden of skin cancer.
Public health policy implementation models indicate
public support is a key factor influencing policy suc-
cess [12]. Public health policymakers can foster public
support in the process of policy implementation by
understanding public support for potential policy
measures and through targeted communications and
outreach efforts to educate key consumer groups about
the rationale and potential impact of policies for im-
proving public health. Understanding the degree to
which consumers support public health policies and
correlates of policy support can help to guide national
implementation efforts. A recent example of the im-
portance of understanding support for potential public
health policies occurred in 2014 in the town of West-
minster, Massachusetts, where public officials pro-
posed a complete ban on the sale of tobacco products
[13]. The vehement response from the town’s citizen-
s—including both tobacco users and non-users—during
town hall meetings and through petitions led public
officials to abandon the proposed policy [13]. Al-
though research has investigated public health policy
support in other behavioral domains (e.g., tobacco
control) [14], evidence on support for indoor tanning
prevention policies and associated behaviors, atti-
tudes, cognitions, and perceptions among young wom-
en is extremely limited [15]. Behavioral theories
identify attitudes, cognitions, and perceived risks as
potentially modifiable precursors to behavior change
[16, 17], thus these constructs may be important targets
of communications to foster support for indoor tan-
ning prevention policy. For example, communications
conveying the risks of indoor tanning and the impor-
tance of indoor tanning policy for reducing potential
risks to key consumer groups may be one strategy to
foster policy support if research indicates it would be
beneficial for this purpose. Such an approach would be
consistent with FDA’s regulatory science goals of en-
suring that key consumer groups are informed about
potential risks of regulated products and the relevant
regulations in order to make informed decisions about
product use [18].
With national momentum building towards a uni-
form set of indoor tanning prevention policies, and
supporting policy statements by health organizations
[19], the goal of this study was to further inform the
implementation of indoor tanning prevention policies
by examining support for specific policy measures
among young non-Hispanic white women ages 18–
30 who indoor tan. Specifically, we investigated sup-
port for indoor tanning policies, some of which were
proposed for national enactment in FDA’s December
2015 proposed rule, including restricting indoor tan-
ning access among minors under the age of 18 and
stronger labels on indoor tanning devices to inform
consumers about the potential risks. We also exam-
ined support for a total ban on indoor tanning, such as
policies in place in Australia and Brazil. Finally, we
investigated correlates of policy support in this
population.
METHODS
Sample and procedures
Participants were 356 young adult women 18–
30 years of age who indoor tanned at least once in
the past 12 months. Participants were recruited as
part of a larger study of high-risk indoor tanning
behavior in young women in the Washington, DC
metropolitan area via community and online adver-
tisements. Recruitment materials provided a brief
description of the study and directed potentially
interested individuals to contact study personnel
by telephone or email. Interested individuals were
screened for eligibility using items from epidemio-
logical surveys assessing demographic characteris-
tics and indoor tanning behavior [7]. Eligible, inter-
ested participants signed written informed consent
forms to complete study enrollment.
All participants completed a confidential, self-report
online survey. Research staff conducted outreach to
participants to ensure timely completion of the online
survey. Participants in the study sample were recruited
from September 2013 to February 2016. All study
procedures were reviewed and approved by the host
institution’s Institutional Review Board.

 Measures
Demographics—Demographic characteristics measured
included age, household income, educational attain-
ment, and whether participants were currently a
college/university student using items from validated
epidemiological surveys [7]. Indoor tanning behaviors
were measured using validated items, with frequent
indoor tanning defined as indoor tanning ten or more
times in the past year [7]. Similarly, age of indoor
tanning initiation was measured using a single item [7].
Indoor tanning attitudes—Ten items assessed attitudes
toward the positive benefits of indoor tanning by cap-
turing participants’ agreement with statements indicat-
ing that indoor tanning makes them look healthier, feel
confident, look more attractive, look younger, and
hides skin flaws and blemishes based and on a 5-
point scale (1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree)
[20, 21]. Example items included “I think I look
healthier when I am tan” and “I look more attractive
when I have a nice tan.” Responses to the items were
averaged to create a summary score with higher values
indicating more favorable attitudes towards indoor
tanning (Cronbach’s α = 0.83).
Indoor tanning cognitions—Participants’ cognitive
rationalizations for indoor tanning behavior were mea-
sured using ten items from a scale developed in a
previous study [22]. Example items include “Tanning
bed use cannot be that bad for you, because many
people who use tanning beds live long lives” and “It
is more important for me to get that tanned look at this
age than to worry about skin cancer.” Responses were
based and on a 5-point scale (1 = strongly disagree,
5 = strongly agree) and were averaged (Cronbach’s
α = 0.77) to create a summary score where higher
values indicating more favorable indoor tanning
cognitions.
Perceived risks of indoor tanning—Participants’ percep-
tions of the health risks associated with indoor tanning,
including skin cancer and appearance-damaging
effects, were measured using four items with a 5-
point response scale (1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly
agree). Items captured participants’ agreement with
statements such as “Indoor tanning can lead to prema-
ture skin wrinkling and aging” and “Indoor tanning
significantly increases my risk of developing skin can-
cer” [23]. Responses were averaged to create a score
where higher values indicate greater perceived risks of
indoor tanning (Cronbach’s α = 0.93).
Perceived severity and susceptibility to skin cancer—Five
items were adapted from previous research to assess
participants’ perceived severity of skin cancer based
on a 5-point scale (1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly
agree) [24]. Example items include “Skin cancer is not
very serious” and “Many people survive skin cancer
without scarring or long-lasting effects.” Responses
were averaged to create an overall score with higher
values indicating greater perceived severity of skin
cancer (Cronbach’s α = 0.73).
Perceived personal susceptibility to the risks of tanning
was measured using seven items adapted from previ-
ous research [24]. Items assessed participants’ level of
agreement with statements about susceptibility to the
risks of tanning on a 5-point scale (1 = strongly dis-
agree, 5 = strongly agree). Example items included “I
am worried about developing skin cancer because of
too much tanning” and “I am likely to develop skin
cancer at some point.” Responses were averaged to
create a score with higher values indicating greater
perceived susceptibility (Cronbach’s α = 0.74).
Indoor tanning policy support—The primary dependent
variables for this study were participants’ support for
three indoor tanning policies, measured with three
items adapted from studies of policy support in other
areas, such as tobacco control [14]. Items were pref-
aced with the introductory statement that “Sometimes
health professionals advocate for stricter federal, state,
and local laws to protect people from the potential
harms of indoor tanning. Please indicate how much
you agree or disagree with the following statements
about these types of laws.” Items measured partici-
pants’ level of agreement with the following state-
ments: “There should be laws to prevent children
under the age of 18 from indoor tanning,” “Indoor
tanning devices should have stronger labels to warn
about the potential health risks of tanning,” and “In-
door tanning devices should be banned.” Responses
were based on a 5-point scale (1 = strongly disagree,
5 = strongly agree). These items were analyzed indi-
vidually as continuous variables, and for descriptive
purposes participants’ responses were also examined
and reported by response category.
Statistical analysis
The statistical analysis occurred through several steps.
Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the
sample and to describe level of support for individual
indoor tanning prevention policies. Bivariate statistical
tests (Pearson’s r correlation, t tests) were used to
examine the associations between demographics, in-
door tanning behavior, indoor tanning attitudes and
perceptions, and policy support variables. Finally,
multivariable linear regression models were created
where each policy support dependent variable was
regressed onto predictor variables that were associated
with policy support at p < .10 in bivariate analyses.
RESULTS
Sample characteristics
Characteristics of the study sample are shown in
Table 1. Participants (n = 356) averaged 23.2 years of
age (SD 3.1 years), 62.9 % had a college degree or
higher, and 59.7 % reported an annual income of
$50,000 per year or higher. On average, participants
first indoor tanned at age 17.1 years (SD 2.6) and
43.9 % were frequent indoor tanners (i.e., ten or more
tanning episodes) in the past year (Table 1). Bivariate
correlations among indoor tanning attitudes, cogni-
tions, perceived risks, perceived severity, and per-
ceived susceptibility ranged from r = −0.43 (p < .001)

Indoor tanning policy support
The categorical distribution of participants’ level
of support for individual indoor tanning preven-
tion policies is shown in Fig. 1. A majority of
participants strongly agreed or agreed that poli-
cies should be in place to prevent children under
the age of 18 from indoor tanning (74.0 %) and
that there should be stronger warnings about the
risks associated with indoor tanning on tanning
devices (74.6 %). A majority disagreed (77.7 %)
that indoor tanning devices should be banned.
The average level of support for policies to re-
strict access among children under age 18 (M 3.9,
SD 1.2) and stronger warnings communicating
the potential risks (M 4.0, SD 1.0) did not differ
significantly (p = .100). However, on average
support for both of these policies was higher than
average support for a total indoor tanning ban (M
2.0, SD 1.0, p < .001).
Correlates of policy support
Bivariate correlates of support for the three indoor
tanning policies examined are shown in Table 1.
Support for policies to prevent children under age
18 from indoor tanning was correlated with age,
age of tanning initiation, and less favorable atti-
tudes and cognitions toward indoor tanning. Sup-
port for policies to prevent children under age 18
from indoor tanning was also lower among those
with less than a college education. Support for
stronger warnings conveying the potential risks of
indoor tanning was lower among frequent indoor
tanners, and was correlated with less favorable
indoor tanning cognitions and stronger perceived
risks, perceived severity, and perceived susceptibil-
ity. Finally, support for a total ban on indoor tan-
ning was lower among those with less than a col-
lege education and among frequent indoor tanners,
and was correlated with less favorable indoor tan-
ning cognitions and attitudes, and stronger per-
ceived risks, perceived severity, and perceived sus-
ceptibility (Table 1).
Results of the multivariable regression models
including all variables associated with support for
each indoor tanning policy at p < .10 in bivariate
analyses are shown in Table 2. Support for policies
to prevent children under the age of 18 from in-
door tanning was greater with increasing age
(β = 0.06, SE = 0.02, p = .011), older age of indoor
tanning initiation (β = 0.07, SE = 0.02, p = .003),
and greater perceived susceptibility to risks of tan-
ning (β = 0.28, SE = 0.09, p = .002). Support for
stronger warnings about risks of tanning was lower
among frequent indoor tanners compared with in-
frequent tanners (β = −0.32, SE = 0.11, p = .003)
and was associated with greater perceived severity
of risks (β = 0.19, SE = 0.08, p = .016) and greater
perceived susceptibility (β = 0.22, SE = 0.22,
p = .005). Finally, support for a total ban on indoor
tanning was lower among frequent tanners com-
pared with infrequent tanners (β = −0.31, SE = 0.11,
p = .004), was associated with less favorable cog-
nitions towards indoor tanning (β = −0.37,
SE = 0.09, p < .001), and was associated with
greater perceived severity of (β = 0.17, SE = 0.08,
p = .034) and greater perceived susceptibility to
(β = 0.29, SE = 0.03, p < .001) the risks of indoor
tanning.

 DISCUSSION
Policies to prevent indoor tanning are recommended
as part of a comprehensive approach to reduce the
population-level burden of skin cancer and other
health outcomes associated with indoor tanning
[25]. As state and national policymakers are consid-
ering implementing indoor tanning prevention pol-
icies, evidence on the level of public support for
specific policy measures among consumer groups
that may be affected can inform implementation
decisions. This study investigated support for in-
door tanning prevention policies among young
adult women who indoor tan, a primary consumer
group who may be affected by such policy measures
and a group at risk of skin cancer and other potential
negative outcomes associated with indoor tanning
behavior. Our results show high levels of support for
some prevention policies, including policies similar
to those that have been recently proposed for na-
tional enactment by FDA, such as policies to pre-
vent children under the age of 18 from indoor tan-
ning and stronger warnings communicating the risks
of indoor tanning on tanning devices. However,
young women in the sample largely did not support
a total ban on indoor tanning. Analyses of correlates
of indoor tanning policy support indicate support
varies by specific subgroups (e.g., past year frequent
tanners) and highlight perceptions and cognitions
correlated with policy support. These findings have
potential implications to inform policy implementa-
tion efforts and future research in this area.
A recent analysis of state-level policies to restrict
youths’ access to indoor tanning indicates more restric-
tive policies such as minimum age requirements are
associated with greater reductions in indoor tanning
prevalence than less restrictive policies (e.g., parental
permission for minors) [9]. A national minimum age
requirement could address documented issues with
retailer compliance with state-level age restrictions by
positioning FDA to take stronger enforcement actions
against retailers in violation of such policies [26]. In the
study sample support for policies to prevent indoor
tanning among children younger than age 18 was high
overall, and on average the young women in our
sample initiated indoor tanning before the age of 18.
This finding is consistent with another recent study
that which found 61 % of female college students
who indoor tanned in the past year, a majority of
whom tanned for the first time before age 18, sup-
ported minimum age requirements [15]. Taken togeth-
er, this evidence suggests a minimum age restriction
may have the potential to prevent the escalation of
indoor tanning behavior from adolescence into young
adulthood. In terms of independent variables exam-
ined, support for policies to prevent indoor tanning
among those under age 18 was most strongly associat-
ed with greater perceived personal susceptibility to the
risks of indoor tanning in multivariable analyses.
This suggests policymakers could craft communi-
cations conveying information about susceptibil-
ity to risks (e.g., that no level of indoor tanning
is safe, that indoor tanning at a younger age
increases skin cancer risks) and the potential pre-
ventive impact of a minimum age restriction as
one possible measure to garner stronger support.
Our results also showed a high level of support for
stronger warnings about the risks of indoor tanning on
tanning devices. The FDA’s recently proposed rule
includes provisions for new warning labels on indoor
tanning devices and requirements that consumers sign
a written acknowledgement listing the potential risks
associated with indoor tanning such as skin cancer.
However, under the proposed rule the required warn-
ings and acknowledgement statement consist of text
only. Evidence suggests that indoor tanning risk com-
munication messages incorporating imagery to en-
hance their persuasive appeal [27] may be more effec-
tive for conveying risks and dissuading indoor tanning
among young women than text-only messaging. Such
communications with visual information about risks
are currently implemented in indoor tanning retail
settings in New York City through policies enacted
there [28] and in the future federal rulemaking could
be undertaken to implement such messages nationally
in the form of warnings on indoor tanning devices and
through other potential communications (e.g., risk ac-
knowledgement statements signed by consumers).
Our data suggest young women may be supportive
of stronger warnings about potential risks of indoor
tanning, that support was lower among women who
indoor tanned frequently, and that greater support was
correlated with higher perceived severity of and per-
sonal susceptibility to the risks associated with indoor
tanning. However, we used a broad measure of sup-
port for stronger warnings about risks on indoor tan-
ning devices and did not examine support for specific
risk communication strategies such as those noted
above (e.g., text-only communications versus messag-
ing with graphic, visual content). Future studies can
further clarify the extent of support for specific policies
in this domain.
In contrast to other policies examined, support for a
total ban on indoor tanning as has been enacted in other
settings (e.g., Australia, Brazil) was low overall. This
finding suggests that although policies can continue to
be strengthened through state and federal rulemaking,
there are likely boundary conditions surrounding spe-
cific policies that young women will support. Support
for a total ban was lower among women who indoor
tanned frequently in the past year, decreased with more
favorable beliefs about indoor tanning, and increased
with greater perceived severity and susceptibility to
risks. Across the different policies examined, our find-
ings indicate that young women in the sample tended to
view favorably age-based restrictions that would not
directly affect them and risk communication policies
that may draw limited attention and be of limited im-
pact (e.g., text-only risk communications) [29], but they
largely did not support policy that would restrict their
personal access to a behavior in which they engage
frequently or that they perceive to be beneficial. Future
studies can help to better understand young women’s

 views on the most restrictive indoor tanning policy
measure—a total ban—by gathering additional data on
the reasons for supporting such a measure in the small
subset of young women who do so.
A total ban on indoor tanning may be unrealistic in
the US regulatory environment considering challenges
to implementing federal regulations in other public
health domains, but more incremental policies could
also be investigated to inform future policy develop-
ment. For example, studies could investigate support
for increasing the minimum age to indoor tan to
21 years, as is being considered for tobacco products
[30], and support for specific aspects of warnings on
indoor tanning devices and other risk communications
(e.g., incorporating persuasive visual content) [29] as
possible future policy measures.
The study findings should be interpreted in light of
important limitations. We assessed support for a small
number of potential policies, and additional studies are
needed to continue to examine levels of support for a
range of specific policy options, such as thresholds for
minimum age restrictions, specific risk communica-
tion strategies (e.g., visual depictions of risks), and
potentially others such as increasing taxation on in-
door tanning [31]. Our measures of policy support
were broad and did not specifically assess young wom-
en’s support for policies recently proposed by the
FDA, although some policies examined were similar
to those proposed. This context may affect their levels
of policy support. The study involved a convenience
sample of non-Hispanic white young adult women
ages 18–30 recruited in a single geographic region,
limiting generalizability to broader populations. Stud-
ies in representative samples that include both indoor
tanners and those who do not will be important to
inform indoor tanning prevention policies at the na-
tional level. Finally, the constructs examined as corre-
lates accounted for a relatively small amount of vari-
ance in policy support (12–19 %). This indicates a need
to consider a broader set of constructs that may be
associated with policy support in future research.
IMPLICATIONS
Young adult women who indoor tan support indoor
tanning prevention policies including policies to pre-
vent indoor tanning among children younger than age
18 and stronger warnings about the risks of indoor
tanning on tanning devices, policies that are similar
to those recently proposed for national enactment by
the FDA. However, support for a total ban on indoor
tanning among the sample was low. Indoor tanning
prevention policy support varied based on indoor
tanning behavior, beliefs, and perceptions as well.
For researchers, in the future as additional regulations
are potentially considered to prevent indoor tanning
and reduce the associated burden of skin cancer, re-
search can inform this process by ascertaining support
for specific policies under consideration among key
consumer groups. For public health practitioners, our
data on the correlates of policy support can also help
them to craft communications about policies including
those conveying information about the potential risks
of indoor tanning. For policymakers, these findings
can potentially inform FDA’s decision-making as the
recently proposed regulations are finalized to consider
regulations that would be acceptable to consumers.
