Abstract –
Objectives: To examine the short-term impact of fluoridation
cessation on children’s caries experience measured by tooth surfaces. If there is
an adverse short-term effect of cessation, it should be apparent when we focus
on smooth tooth surfaces, where fluoride is most likely to have an impact for
the age group and time frame considered in this study. Methods: We examined
data from population-based samples of school children (Grade 2) in two similar
cities in the province of Alberta, Canada: Calgary, where cessation occurred in
May 2011 and Edmonton where fluoridation remains in place. We analysed
change over time (2004/2005 to 2013/2014) in summary data for primary (defs)
and permanent (DMFS) teeth for Calgary and Edmonton, for all tooth surfaces
and smooth surfaces only. We also considered, for 2013/2014 only, the exposed
subsample defined as lifelong residents who reported usually drinking tap
water. Results: We observed, across the full sample, an increase in primary
tooth decay (mean defs – all surfaces and smooth surfaces) in both cities, but
the magnitude of the increase was greater in Calgary (F-cessation) than in
Edmonton (F-continued). For permanent tooth decay, when focusing on
smooth surfaces among those affected (those with DMFS>0), we observed a
non-significant trend towards an increase in Calgary (F-cessation) that was not
apparent in Edmonton (F-continued). Conclusions: Trends observed for primary
teeth were consistent with an adverse effect of fluoridation cessation on
children’s tooth decay, 2.5–3 years post-cessation. Trends for permanent teeth
hinted at early indication of an adverse effect. It is important that future data
collection efforts in the two cities be undertaken, to permit continued
monitoring of these trends.

Since its initial implementation in 1945, much
research has been conducted on community water
fluoridation (CWF) and its impact on dental caries.
Mechanistically, fluoride benefits teeth by inhibiting
tooth demineralization, enhancing re-mineralization,
and inhibiting enzyme activity of plaque bacteria1.

 While both a systemic (pre-eruptive) and a topical
(post-eruptive) mechanism of impact have been
studied intensively, experts now seem to agree that
fluoride’s major anti-cariogenic effect is post-erup-
tive1,2; however, studies have continued to accrue
that are consistent with some pre-eruptive effect3.
As a whole, the evidence base supports the bene-
fits of fluoridation for preventing caries in popula-
tions4,5.
However,
systematic
reviews
have
highlighted methodological limitations of the evi-
dence base, such as weak study designs4,5. This
reflects that research on CWF and CWF cessation is
observational (takes advantage of natural experi-
ment circumstances) and may rely on pre-existing
data collected for another purpose. Contemporary
evidence was furthermore noted to be sparse: in a
recent systematic review5, 71% of included studies
were conducted prior to 1975.
To a large extent, the research literature is char-
acterized by studies of fluoridation initiation, early
in the intervention’s history6,7 and cross-sectional
comparisons of fluoridated and non-fluoridated
communities8–10. There is less research on fluorida-
tion cessation circumstances11, even though cessa-
tion appears to be occurring with increasing
frequency in some regions. For example, in Canada
alone since 2005, more than 30 communities have
opted to discontinue fluoridation12. To inform fluo-
ridation decision-making, high-quality research on
the impact of cessation is needed. In our context,
there was demand from decision-makers for high-
quality, locally relevant evidence on the impact of
fluoridation cessation on dental caries experience.
A systematic review (L. McLaren and S. Singhal,
unpublished results) identified 15 instances of pub-
lished research on fluoridation cessation in 13
countries.
Those
studies
provided
important
insight into the impact of cessation on dental caries
in different contexts. However, many of the studies
had important methodological limitations, such as
no comparison community13 or no questionnaire
data to assess important covariates14. Furthermore,
many of the cessation studies were older: of the 15
jurisdictions represented in the review, only six
focused on cessation that occurred in 1990 or
later3,13,15–18 and only one3 since 2000. Older stud-
ies may not reflect contemporary circumstances
such as historically low caries rates, skewed caries
distributions
(smaller
proportion
of
people
accounting for the majority of problems) and mul-
tiple sources of exposure to fluoride19. Finally, with
important exceptions16, many studies examined
the impact of cessation using tooth-level data.
Tooth surface-level data would be preferable, if the
aim is to evaluate a prevention initiative20 such as
community water fluoridation or its cessation.
The purpose of this study was to examine the
impact of fluoridation cessation
on children’s
dental caries. Our analysis took advantage of the
natural experiment opportunity provided by fluo-
ridation cessation in the city of Calgary, Canada,
which occurred in May 2011 (after having been in
place since 1991). Published definitions of interven-
tion in the research context highlight ‘intentional
change’21 and ‘to disturb the ‘natural’ order of
things’22, and thus accommodate cessation (as well
as initiation) of CWF as a viable study focus. We
compared caries rates in Calgary to those in the
city of Edmonton, where fluoridation began in
1967 and remains in place. Elsewhere (L. McLaren,
S. Patterson, S. Thawer, P. Faris, D. McNeil, M.
Potestio et al., unpublished results) we reported on
tooth-level data and showed that for primary (but
not permanent) teeth, a significant increase in car-
ies between pre- and post-cessation was observed
in Calgary (F-cessation). The effect was smaller
and less consistent in Edmonton (F-continued).
These initial findings for primary teeth were con-
sistent with a short-term adverse effect of cessation
on caries experience.
The objective of this article was to report further
on the impact of CWF cessation on children’s caries
experience, focusing on smooth tooth surfaces,
where fluoride is most likely to have an impact23
for the age group and time frame considered in this
study. If there is an adverse effect of fluoridation
cessation, as observed in our other paper, it should
be apparent using this more sensitive measure.
Materials and methods
Design
We used a pre–post cross-sectional design with
comparison group. Data were collected from popu-
lation-based samples of schoolchildren during the
2004/2005 and 2013/2014 school years (October–
May/June). The target population was children in
grade 2 attending school in the Public or Catholic
school system in Calgary and Edmonton. Calgary
and Edmonton are well matched: they are the two
largest cities in the province of Alberta and are
both large urban centres with diverse demographic
profiles.
We
ascertained
fluoride
content
of
municipal drinking water in the two cities by
securing annual water quality reports (L. McLaren,
275
Fluoridation cessation in Calgary, Canada
 S. Patterson, S. Thawer, P. Faris, D. McNeil, M.
Potestio et al., unpublished results).
Pre-cessation data (2004/2005)
Pre-cessation data for Calgary and Edmonton were
available
from
population-based
surveys
con-
ducted by former health regions in Alberta in
2004/2005. Oral health data were collected via
open mouth examinations conducted in the schools
by trained and calibrated assessment teams, each
consisting of a registered dental hygienist and a
clerk. Decayed, missing/extracted, and filled teeth
and surfaces were recorded using standard crite-
ria20. Decay referred to cavitated decay, defined as
a lesion that ‘has a detectably softened floor,
undermined enamel or softened wall. On inter-
proximal surfaces, the point of the explorer must
enter a lesion with certainty’24.
For Calgary in 2004/2005, a stratified random
sample was selected, with strata based on median
neighbourhood income quartile where the school
was located. Within sampled schools, all children
of eligible grades were invited to participate. An
opt-in consent process was used, and the participa-
tion rate was 60%24. In Edmonton in 2004/2005, all
elementary schools in the two school boards were
invited to participate, and within each school, a
sample was taken from each class with the sample
size predetermined based on class size (80–100% of
the full class). The participation rate was approxi-
mately 89%.
Post-cessation data (2013/2014)
Data collection in 2013/2014 was designed to maxi-
mize comparability with the 2004/2005 surveys.
We drew a stratified random sample, with strata
based on the median neighbourhood income quar-
tile where the school was located. Trained and cali-
brated assessment teams, each consisting of a
registered dental hygienist and a clerk, conducted
open mouth examinations following the protocol
from the Iowa Fluoride Study25, which is based on
the WHO criteria20 and yields a d1d2-3mf index
based on whole tooth codes and 2-digit surface-
specific codes. Our analysis focused on d2-3 to
permit comparability with the decay data in the
2004–05 surveys. Assessments were based on all
primary teeth and a subset of 12 permanent teeth
(central incisors, lateral incisors and 1st molars).
The same 12 permanent teeth were considered pre-
and post-cessation. Assessment teams were trained
together in the protocol, and each team was cali-
brated on two occasions (early October and mid-
November 2013) by a public health dentist with
considerable experience in survey calibration and
an extensive knowledge and background in survey
methodology and tooth surface-level assessment.
Signed parental consent and child verbal assent
were secured for the open mouth examination.
Post-cessation data collection also included a par-
ent questionnaire and, for a small random subsam-
ple in each city, fingernail clippings to assess total
fluoride
intake
(L.
McLaren,
S.
Patterson,
S.
Thawer, P. Faris, D. McNeil, M. Potestio et al.,
unpublished results). The 2013/2014 school-level
participation rates were 57.3% (Calgary) and 54.1%
(Edmonton), and the student-level participation
rate within participating schools were 49.1% (Cal-
gary) and 47.0% (Edmonton).
Variables and data analysis
In this article, we focused on summary data for
tooth surfaces, both primary (defs) and permanent
(DMFS). Because both defs and DMFS tended to be
positively skewed, we examined both overall mean
and the mean for those with one or more defs or
DMFS. We considered all tooth surfaces, as well as
smooth surfaces only. Our designation of smooth
surfaces included all surfaces except the following:
occlusal surfaces (whenever present), and surfaces
where pit and fissure caries commonly occur,
namely buccal (vestibular) surfaces for teeth 46
and 36, and lingual surfaces for teeth 16 and 26
(Though we had codes to specifically indicate pit
and fissure caries in the 2013/2014 data, we used
the proxy approach of excluding certain surfaces to
permit comparability with 2004/2005 (for which
we did not have that specific information). When
we computed smooth surface caries summary
measures in 2013/2014 using the specific pit and
fissure designation, the estimates tended to be
higher (for example, in Table 1b, mean DMFS
among those with DMFS>0 was 2.3 [versus 2.0] for
Calgary and 2.1 [versus 1.7] for Edmonton).).
Permanent tooth summary data (DMFS) were
based on children with at least one permanent
tooth. The percentage of children with at least one
permanent tooth, and the mean number of perma-
nent teeth, did not differ appreciably across sur-
veys: the percentages with zero permanent teeth
were 1.5% (Calgary 2004/2005), 1.1% (Edmonton
2004/2005), 1.5% (Calgary 2013/2014) and 1.9%
(Edmonton 2013/2014), and the mean numbers of
permanent teeth, of the 12 assessed, were 9.1 (Cal-
gary 2004/2005), 9.0 (Edmonton 2004/2005), 8.8
(Calgary 2013/2014) and 8.7 (Edmonton 2013/

Fluoridation cessation in Calgary, Canada
 2014). The median (6) and range (0–12) were the
same for all four survey samples.
For 2013/2014 only, we additionally considered
the subsample of lifelong residents who reported
usually drinking tap water (versus bottled water).
This information was gleaned from the parent
questionnaires included as part of the 2013/2014
data collection.
We examined change over time in Calgary (F-
cessation)
compared
to
change
over
time
in
Edmonton (F-continued). Change over time was
inferred from non-overlapping 95% confidence
intervals for means, which was then verified by
testing a year x city interaction term in a Poisson
regression.
All analyses applied sampling weights developed
for this project, which accounted for the clustered
sampling design and response imbalances. We also
ran all analyses unweighted and results were
broadly similar (no change to statistical significance).
Weighted estimates are presented below.
The study received approval from the Conjoint
Health Research Ethics Board at the University of
Calgary (ID E-25219) and the Health Research
Ethics Board at the University of Alberta (ID
Pro00037808).
Approval
was
also
sought
and
granted by all four participating school boards.
Results
Results for primary teeth were based on the follow-
ing sample sizes: n = 599 for Calgary 2004/2005;
n = 6445 for Edmonton 2004/2005; n = 3230 for
Calgary 2013/2014; and n = 2307 for Edmonton
2013/2014. The sample sizes for permanent teeth
were slightly smaller because the denominator
included those with at least one permanent tooth.
Sample sizes for the 2013/2014 subsample (lifelong
residents who reported usually drinking tap water)
were: n = 930 and n = 916 for Calgary defs and
DMFS, respectively, and n = 575 and n = 565 for
Edmonton defs and DMFS, respectively.
The summary data for Calgary and Edmonton,
in 2004/2005 (pre-cessation) and 2013/2014 (post-
cessation) are shown in Table 1. For primary teeth
(defs),
a
statistically
significant
increase
was
apparent in both Calgary and Edmonton, although
the absolute magnitude of the increase was greater
in Calgary (F-cessation). This was true for all pri-
mary tooth surfaces (Table 1a) and for primary
smooth surfaces only (Table 1b). In all cases (mean
defs, mean defs among those with defs>0; all sur-
faces
and
smooth
surfaces
only),
the
greater
increase in Calgary compared to Edmonton was
confirmed in a Poisson regression that showed a
statistically significant year x city interaction term
(far right hand column in Table 1), indicating that
the increase in primary tooth decay in Calgary (F-
cessation) over time was significantly greater than
that in Edmonton.
Table 1 also contains permanent tooth summary
data (DMFS). For all tooth surfaces among perma-
nent teeth (Table 1a), there was a statistically sig-
nificant decrease in Calgary, for the overall mean
DMFS, which was not observed in Edmonton. For
permanent tooth smooth surfaces only (Table 1b),
there was no statistically significant change over
time in Calgary or Edmonton. However, we noted
a trend (non-significant) towards an increase in

Table 2 shows summary data for 2013/2014, but
this time estimates were restricted to the subsample

ple (Table 2) tended to be similar to or lower than
for the full sample (Table 1) for both Calgary and
Edmonton, with few exceptions (permanent tooth
measures for smooth surfaces in Calgary). The
2013/2014 subsample estimates in Table 2 could
not be compared directly to 2004/2005 data, due to
lack of questionnaire data which with to define a
comparable subsample in 2004/2005.
Discussion
We set out to examine the short-term impact of flu-
oridation cessation on children’s caries experience,
with a specific interest in whether findings we
observed based on tooth-level data (L. McLaren, S.
Patterson, S. Thawer, P. Faris, D. McNeil, M. Potes-
tio et al., unpublished results) – namely an adverse
effect of cessation on caries experience for primary
teeth – were also apparent when focusing on
smooth tooth surfaces, where fluoride is most
likely to have an impact23 for the age group and
limited period of time considered in this study. If
an adverse effect of cessation is indeed occurring,
it should be apparent when using this more sensi-
tive measure.
This line of thinking was borne out in our
results. In primary teeth, an increase in caries expe-
rience was observed in Calgary (where cessation
occurred in 2011). A similar observation, which
was smaller in magnitude, was noted in Edmonton
(where fluoridation remained in place). Thus, for
primary teeth, our results presented here and else-
where (L. McLaren, S. Patterson, S. Thawer, P.
Faris, D. McNeil, M. Potestio et al., unpublished
results) provide consistent indication of an adverse
short-term effect of cessation.
In permanent teeth, we elsewhere (L. McLaren,
S. Patterson, S. Thawer, P. Faris, D. McNeil, M.
Potestio et al., unpublished results) reported a
decrease in caries over time in both Calgary (F-ces-
sation) and Edmonton (F-continued), which was
larger and more consistent in Calgary. Based on
knowledge of enamel differences between primary
and permanent teeth26,27, which make it likely that
effects of cessation would appear sooner in pri-
mary teeth, we suggested that the absence of an
increase in permanent teeth may have reflected the
short time frame since cessation in our study, and
that continued monitoring would be important to
see if an adverse effect in permanent teeth emerges
as time passes.
In this study, though effects were not statistically
significant, the decrease in permanent tooth decay
in Calgary (F-cessation) that we observed using
tooth-level data (L. McLaren, S. Patterson, S.
Thawer, P. Faris, D. McNeil, M. Potestio et al.,
unpublished results) and for all tooth surfaces (this
manuscript,
Table 1a)
was
muted
when
we
focused on smooth surfaces only; and for mean
DMFS among those with DMFS>0, the direction of
change became positive (though non-significant).
Further, though estimates from the 2013/2014 sub-
sample (lifelong residents who reported usually
drinking tap water) are based on small numbers,
they were nonetheless consistent with an apparent
increase in Calgary (F-cessation), because the Cal-
gary estimate of mean DMFS among those with
DMFS>0 was even higher in the subsample (3.0)
(that is, even more discrepant from the 2004/2005
estimate) than in the full sample (2.0). Though we
do not know what the subsample estimates would
have been for 2004/2005 due to lack of question-
naire data, we note that both residential mobility
and bottled water consumption were lower in
2004/2005 than in 2013/2014. Specifically, net
migration (inter- and intra-provincial) increased in
Calgary from 14 099 in 2004/2005 to 16 781 in
2013/2014, and in Edmonton from 9548 in 2004/
2005 to 17 482 in 2013/201428 (that is, the popula-
tion in both cities was more stable, in terms of
migration, in 2004/2005 than in 2013/2014), and
statistics on bottled water sales for Canada showed
an increase over time; for example, litres per
household (total volume) increased from 104.5 in
2004 to 173.8 in 201429 (Data on bottled water sales
or consumption for the specific parameters of Cal-
gary, Edmonton, 2004/05 and 2013/14 could not
be located.). Therefore, it seems reasonable to
assert that the discrepancy between the estimates
for the full sample and for the subsample would be
larger in 2013/2014 than in 2004/2005; or in other
words, it would make less difference to exclude
non-lifelong residents and bottled water drinkers
in 2004/2005 than in 2013/2014. However, we do
not know this for certain.

Fluoridation cessation in Calgary, Canada
 Taken together, our findings were consistent
with an adverse effect of fluoridation cessation on
children’s
caries
experience,
about
2.5–3 years
post-cessation. The effect was most apparent for
primary teeth, but it appeared from these analyses
that an effect for permanent teeth, which, initially,
we hypothesized would take longer to occur (if it
occurred at all), was emerging. If true, one might
expect a statistically significant effect on perma-
nent teeth to become evident at further follow-up
as the permanent teeth in the age group studied
have been present in the mouth for a longer period.
As we reported elsewhere, findings were consis-
tent with lower fluoride in Calgary than in Edmon-
ton based on 1) annual estimates of fluoride in
drinking water secured from each city and 2) esti-
mates of total fluoride intake from biomarkers (fin-
gernail clippings) from a subsample in each city.
Furthermore, estimates were robust to adjustment
for
socio-demographic
and
behavioural/dental
characteristics of the Calgary and Edmonton sam-
ples in 2013/2014 (L. McLaren, S. Patterson, S.
Thawer, P. Faris, D. McNeil, M. Potestio et al.,
unpublished results).
Our findings contribute to the published litera-
ture on fluoridation cessation and impact on dental
caries. While several studies showed an increase in
caries following cessation of fluoridation17,30, sev-
eral others did not31,32. Among the studies that did
observe an increase in caries, several were many
years or decades old33,34, and it is important to
question whether an adverse effect of fluoridation
cessation on caries experience is apparent contem-
porarily. Our results were somewhat different
from the one other Canadian study16,35 which,
based on repeated cross-sectional data, did not
observe an adverse trend in tooth decay in the ces-
sation community, following cessation in 1992.
However, that finding may have reflected changes
over time in treatment and preventive practices
such as an increase in application of protective sea-
lants, and the importance of investigating smooth
surfaces. Collectively, the literature (including our
study) indicates that the impact of fluoridation ces-
sation on dental caries is not uniformly positive or
negative but varies by time and place, and sorting
out the reasons for different patterns is important.
The increase in caries (especially in primary
teeth) observed in both cities in our study, though
consistent
with
anecdotal
reports
from
those
regions (personal communication, Associate Den-
tal Public Health Officer, Alberta Health Services,
19 January 2015), contrasts with other reports of a
general decline in child caries prevalence during
recent decades19,36. The reasons for the increase are
not known but could have to do with various fac-
tors impacting the province or larger geographies.
Some examples include the global economic reces-
sion of 2008 and its social and economic aftermath;
shifts in the Alberta economy due to rising and fall-
ing prices in the province’s primary industry of oil
and gas, which have implications for employment
and
migration
(workers
coming
to
Alberta);
increasing
ethnic
diversity
in
Canadian
cities
including Alberta (for example, the percent of the
Alberta population who only speak a non-official
language most often at home has shown an
increasing trend, with 7.5%, 9.1% and 10.5% in the
2001, 2006 and 2011 census, respectively)37,38; and
trends in bottled water consumption which, as
noted above, has increased for Canada as a whole.
Although data on trends in sugar consumption are
not specifically available for our samples, national
data suggest that that may not present a likely
explanation: although the percentage of daily calo-
ries from sugar is higher among four- to eight-year
olds (which contains the age group in our study)
than among the population as a whole (26%, ver-
sus
21%)39,
overall,
sugar
consumption
has
decreased for the Canadian population over time,
including between 2004 and 201340. The reasons
for the increase in caries in our two cities is an
important remaining question.
Limitations of our study included the short dura-
tion of follow-up since cessation, the absence of
questionnaire data from 2004/2005, non-identical
examination
criteria
at
the
two
time
points
(although both were anchored in the WHO criteria
and yielded comparable summary measures), the
use of different (though highly-skilled) calibrators
in 2004/2005 and 2013/2014 and lack of blinding
of examiners to residence of participants. Our pre-
cessation data (2004/2005) were collected several
years prior to cessation (2011) and it would have
been preferable to have data collected closer to the
year of cessation. However, elsewhere (L. McLa-
ren, S. Patterson, S. Thawer, P. Faris, D. McNeil, M.
Potestio et al., unpublished results) we considered
other possible explanations such as socio-demo-
graphic characteristics of the samples and dental
treatment and preventive programming and con-
cluded that they did not appear to represent likely
alternative explanations for our findings. The
greater increase over time in deciduous caries
experience observed in Calgary reflects, in part, the
low estimates in 2004/2005 (compared to Edmon-
280
McLaren et al.
 ton). However, because of the rigorous sampling
methods and development and application of sam-
pling weights, we believe the 2004/2005 estimates
to be an accurate reflection of the caries experience
at that time. The differences between Calgary and
Edmonton pre-cessation speak to the importance
of using a study design that involves comparison
of change over time when evaluating the impact of
CWF cessation, versus a cross-sectional post-cessa-
tion study.
Strengths of our study include: high-quality oral
health data gathered by trained and calibrated den-
tal professionals; population-based samples cou-
pled
with
development
and
application
of
sampling weights to maximize representativeness
of each sample of its underlying population; a
comparative study design that permitted analysis
of change over time; and multiple sources of data
(open mouth examination; biomarker data; ques-
tionnaire) which allowed for assessment of consis-
tency of findings across multiple indicators.
In conclusion, findings observed for primary
teeth were consistent with an adverse effect of fluo-
ridation cessation on children’s tooth decay, 2.5–
3 years post-cessation. Trends for permanent teeth
hinted at early indication of an adverse effect. It is
important that future data collection efforts in the
two cities be undertaken, to allow continued moni-
toring of these trends.
