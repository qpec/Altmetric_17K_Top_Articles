lthough Zika virus was introduced to the Americas in 
2013,1 widespread transmission became recognized in 
late 2015,2–4 with the Pernambuco state of Brazil serving 
as the epicentre of what has evolved into an international crisis.5,6 
Within weeks, transmission became increasingly dispersed across 
the Americas such that, at the time of writing, autochthonous 
Zika transmission was documented in 50 countries of the Ameri­
cas, including the United States.7 Cases acquired in the Americas 
are being exported around the globe with regularity,8,9 and sec­
ondary sexual transmission of Zika virus in nonendemic areas is 
now well described.10,11 In addition, new clinical syndromes attrib­
utable to Zika virus are becoming increasingly recognized,12 
although how frequently these syndromes occur among exported 
versus endemic cases is unknown.
Many series to date have documented the epidemiologic fea­
tures and clinical spectrum of Zika virus exported to other coun­
tries.8,9,13 Data specific to Canadian travellers with Zika infection 
have yet to be synthesized, which constitutes an important 
knowledge gap owing to the lack of vectorial transmission of 
Zika in Canada. Given that Canadians are a highly mobile popu­
lation, we present a Canada­specific surveillance summary of 
Zika infection in a cohort of Canadian travellers returning from 
the Americas who presented for care to a CanTravNet site over a 
1­year period.

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: Widespread transmis­
sion of Zika virus in the Americas has 
occurred since late 2015. We examined 
demographic and travel­related charac­
teristics of returned Can 
adian travellers 
with Zika infection acquired in the 
Americas to illuminate risk factors for 
acquisition and the clinical spectrum.
METHODS: We analyzed demographic and 
travel­related data for returned Canadian 
travellers who presented to a CanTravNet 
site between October 2015 and Septem­
ber 2016 for care of Zika virus acquired in 
the Americas. Data were collected with 
use of the GeoSentinel Surveillance Net­
work data platform.
RESULTS: During the study period, 1118 
travellers presented to a CanTravNet site 
after returning from the Americas, 41 
(3.7%) of whom had Zika infection. Zika 
infection from the Americas was diag­
nosed at CanTravNet sites as often as 
dengue (n = 41) over the study period. In 
the first half of the study period, Zika 
virus burden was borne by people visit­
ing friends and relatives in South Amer­
ica. In the latter half, coincident with the 
increased spread of Zika throughout the 
Caribbean and Central America, Zika 
virus occurred more often in tourists in 
the Caribbean. Forty (98%) of the travel­
lers with Zika infection acquired it 
through probable mosquito exposure, 
and 1 had confirmed sexual acquisition. 
Congenital transmission occurred in 2 of 
3 pregnancies. Two (5%) of those with 
Zika had symptoms resembling those of 
Guillain–Barré syndrome, 1 of whom also 
had Zika viral meningitis.
INTERPRETATION: Even in this small 
cohort, we observed the full clinical spec­
trum of acute Zika virus, including adverse 
fetal and neurologic outcomes. Our obser­
vations suggest that complications from 
Zika infection are under 
estimated by data 
arising exclusively from populations where 
Zika is endemic. Travellers should adhere 
to mosquito­avoidance measures and bar­
rier protection during sexual activity.

illness in Canada. It provides situational awareness support to 
the Public Health Agency of Canada. Recent surveillance analy­
ses using CanTravNet data in collaboration with the Public 
Health Agency of Canada have shown consistent capture of 
about 15% of travel­acquired illnesses imported to Canada.
CanTravNet sites are all members of GeoSentinel, a global surveil­
lance network of the International Society of Travel Medicine. The 
GeoSentinel network is situated on 6 continents and has strict affilia­
tion criteria, including recognized travel medicine expertise on the 
part of site directors and high volumes of ill returned travellers cared 
for at individual sites. Demographic and travel­related data are col­
lected using the GeoSentinel data platform, as previously described15 
(for additional details see www.istm.org/geosentinel). The GeoSenti­
nel data collection protocol is reviewed cyclically by the institutional 
review board officer at the National Center for Emerging and Zoo­
notic Infectious Diseases at the US Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention. The protocol is classified as public health surveillance, 
not human­subjects research requiring submission to and approval 
from institutional review boards. Final diagnoses include specific 
causes (e.g., Zika virus) and syndromes (e.g., rash).
Definitions and classifications
We used 5 travel­purpose designations, coded into the GeoSentinel 
data collection document: tourism; business; missionary/volunteer/
research/aid work; visiting friends and relatives; and education. The 
designation “visiting friends and relatives” has been previously 
described.16 Month of acquisition was defined by date of symptom 
onset in relation to the median probable incubation period: symp­
tom onset within the first 4 days of a given month was ascribed as 
acquisition in the prior month, and symptom onset between the 
fifth to the last day of a given month was attributed to acquisition in 
that month. Objective neurologic impairment (e.g., meningitis, 
encephalitis, myelitis, Guillain–Barré syndrome or neuropathy) and 
congenital infection were considered to be severe complications of 
Zika infection. Dengue was considered to be severe if accompanied 
by plasma leakage, third­spacing of fluid, hemorrhagic complica­
tions, end­organ damage, or respiratory distress as defined by the 
World Health Organization.17
Inclusion criteria
We extracted and analyzed demographic, clinical and travel­related 
data on ill Can 
adians returning from travel to the Americas, and 
non­Canadians who fell ill during their travel to Canada, who were 
encountered at any of 7 CanTravNet sites from Oct. 1, 2015, to 
Sept. 30, 2016. We included only patients who had a final diagnosis 
of Zika virus infection confirmed either serologically (i.e., positive re­
sult on IgM enzyme­linked immunosorbent assay and plaque reduc­
tion neutralization test performed at Canada’s National Microbiol­
ogy Laboratory) or by real­time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). 
Diagnostic testing algorithms in Canada support the use of both PCR 
and serologic testing during the acute stage of illness (i.e., within the 
first 14 d), and only serologic testing beyond the acute stage.
Statistical analysis
Extracted data were managed in a Microsoft Access database. 
Travellers were described by purpose of travel, demographic 
characteristics, presence or absence of a pre­travel medical 
encounter, destination and method of diagnosis. Women of 
child­bearing age were defined as those between 15 and 49 years 
of age. Differences between groups of travellers were compared 
with the use of the Fisher exact test or, in the case of continuous 
variables, the Mann–Whitney rank sum test. All statistical compu­
tations were performed with the use of GraphPad Prism software 
(GraphPad Software Inc.).
Results
During the study period, 1118 ill travellers presented to a 
CanTravNet site after returning from the Americas. Of these, 41 
(3.7%) were found to have Zika virus infection, 41 (3.7%) dengue 
and 23 (2.1%) chikungunya. As of Oct. 6, 2016, the Government 
of Canada had reported 330 confirmed cases of Zika virus infec­
tion (14 of which occurred in pregnant women) in Canada;18 
thus, the CanTravNet cases accounted for 12% of the national 
burden. Twenty­four (59%) of the travellers with Zika in our 
study were women, of whom 19 (79%) were of child­bearing age, 
and 3 (12%) were pregnant. Forty (98%) of the travellers with 
Zika virus infection acquired it through probable mosquito 
exposure, and 1 (2%) had confirmed sexual acquisition. The 
median age was 36 years (range 13–70 yr; interquartile range 
[IQR] 30–53 yr).
Most of the Zika cases occurred in Canadians who were trav­
elling as tourists (n = 17; 41%) or were visiting friends and rela­
tives (n = 15; 37%); the remainder were travelling for business 
(n = 4; 10%), missionary/aid work (n = 4; 10%) or education­
related travel (n = 1; 2%) (Table 1). Within the Americas, the 
most common region of exposure was the Caribbean (n = 22; 
54%), followed by Central America (n = 10; 24%) and South 
America (n = 8; 20%) (Table 1). The 1 case of sexual acquisition 
occurred in Canada from a partner who had been infected in the 
Caribbean. The top countries of exposure were Colombia (n = 7; 
17%), Trinidad and Tobago (n = 6; 15%), Nicaragua (n = 5; 12%), 
Barbados (n = 3; 7%), El Salvador (n = 3; 7%) and Martinique (n = 
3; 7%); only 1 (2%) of the cases was acquired in Brazil, and none 
in Florida. The most common months of acquisition were 
August (n = 9; 22%), July (n = 8; 20%) and December (n = 6; 15%) 
(Figure 1). The median duration of travel was 15 days (range 
4–420 d; IQR 10–28 d).
Over the course of the outbreak in the Americas, the epide­
miologic features of Zika cases seen at CanTravNet sites 
changed. From October 2015 to March 2016, 54% of the cases 
were acquired in South America, whereas from April to Septem­
ber 2016, only 4% of cases were acquired in South America (p < 
0.001) (Table 1). Similarly, from October to March, 46% of the 
cases were acquired in the Caribbean or Central America. Con­
versely, from April to September, 93% were acquired in that 
region (p = 0.002) (Table 1).
Among the travellers with Zika, rash (n = 36; 88%) and fever 
(n = 33; 80%) were the most common presenting symptoms 
(Table 2). About half reported arthralgia (n = 22; 54%) or myal­
gia (n = 19; 46%), 41% had headache (n = 17), and 5 (12%) had 
conjunctivitis. Two (5%) travellers with Zika had symptoms

resembling those of Guillain–Barré syndrome, acutely charac­
terized by peripheral weakness, paresthesia and hyporeflexia; 
1 of them also had Zika viral meningitis. One ill traveller with 
Zika also had related epididymitis. A comparison of presenting 
symptoms between patients with Zika and those with dengue is 
provided in Table 2. In most cases (n = 28; 68%), Zika­related 
symptoms developed during travel; the remainder occurred a 
median 3 days after travel (range 1–7 d; IQR 2–6 d).
Nineteen (46%) of Zika cases were confirmed by serologic 
testing alone; another 15 (37%) were confirmed by real­time 
PCR alone. The remaining 7 (17%) were found to be positive for 
Zika virus by both serologic testing and PCR. Most of the travel­
lers with Zika (n = 32; 78%) presented for care during the acute 
phase (within 10 d after symptom onset) or early convalescent 
phase (10–30 d after symptom onset); the remaining 9 (22%) 
presented during late convalescence (> 1 mo after symptom 
onset). Those who presented during the acute or early conva­
lescent phase were also tested for dengue and chikungunya; 
2 (5%) of those with Zika were also positive for chikungunya 
IgM antibodies, which likely reflects intercurrent or recently 
acquired chikungunya virus. Among those presenting during 
the acute or early convalescent phase of Zika virus infection, 
the median time from symptom onset to assessment at a Can­
TravNet site was 8 days (range 2–30 d; IQR 5–14 d). Among 
those in the late convalescent phase of Zika virus infection, the 
median time from symptom onset to assessment at a CanTrav­
Net clinic was 64 days (range 45–160 d; IQR 50–92 d). 
Among travellers with Zika who presented for care during the 
acute phase (n = 20), PCR was positive in 10 (50%) and serologic 
testing was positive in 15 (75%); however, only 1 test was posi­
tive in 15 (75%): PCR in 5 (25%) and serologic testing in 10 (50%). 
Among those who presented during the early convalescent 
phase (n = 11), PCR was positive in 7 (64%) and serologic testing 
was positive in 5 (45%).
Both of the travellers who had symptoms resembling those of 
Guillain–Barré syndrome presented for care during the acute or 
early convalescent phase of illness, which yielded an approxi­
mate 6% prevalence of neurologic involvement among the trav­
ellers with Zika who presented during the acute or early conva­
lescent phase. In 2 of 3 cases of Zika in pregnant travellers, 
congenital infection was documented by detection of the virus in 
fetal tissue. Overall, 4 (10%) of the 41 travellers with Zika had a 
severe complication of the infection, as compared with none of 
the 41 travellers with dengue (p = 0.1).
Interpretation
Our analysis of surveillance data provides demographic and 
travel­related details for a subset of Canadian travellers who 
acquired Zika virus in the Americas. We have described our col­
lective 1­year experience with this emerging imported arboviral 
infection. Our findings show strong potential for secondary 
transmission in Canada, both sexually and congenitally. Our 
analysis also establishes a clinical and epidemiologic framework

for the pre­ and post­travel consultation processes: Zika was as 
common as dengue as a cause of illness upon return from the 
Americas; neurologic complications of Zika were common; sex­
ual transmission occurred even in this small cohort; and a 
2­pronged approach to diagnostic testing is supported by the 
limited overlap between seropositive and PCR­positive cases.
Even though Zika was diagnosed as often as dengue in this 
cohort, the rate of complications of acute illness was much 
higher among those with Zika than among those with dengue. 
Dengue is one of the most common causes of fever in returned 
travellers19 and a common cause of hospital admission among ill 
returned travellers in general. Depending on the diagnostic cri­
teria applied, severe dengue is thought to occur in 1% to 20% of 
all imported dengue cases.20,21 The common perception that 
Zika is associated with a more mild or benign clinical course 
than that of dengue or chikungunya was not borne out in this 
small cohort. Strong referral bias is unlikely, because the symp­
toms on presentation were mostly nonspecific, and the practice 
in the CanTravNet sites is to test most patients for all 3 infec­
tions, given common epidemiologic features and vectorial 
transmission. Accrual of further large­scale data on imported 
Zika is required to understand the true prevalence of complica­
tions of infection among travellers. Because of a lack of vaccine 
availability or chemoprophylaxis (2 common strategies for pre­
vention of travel­acquired illness), prevention of all 3 arboviral 
infections relies solely on the use of mosquito­avoidance mea­
sures (e.g., screens or netting, insecticide­treated clothing, and 
insect repellents).22,23
Neurologic complications of Zika were observed in 5% of the 
travellers in our small cohort. The substantial neurotropism of 
Zika virus24,25 was supported by our observation of symptoms 
similar to those of Guillain–Barré syndrome, meningitis and 
polyneuropathy in 5% of the travellers with Zika. Population­
level analysis of neurologic disorders in Colombia has shown 
that, since the recognition of the Zika virus outbreak, there has 
been a fourfold increase in the number of reported cases of 
Guillain–Barré syndrome, but no commensurate increase in 
reported myelopathies, neuropathies or demyelinating disor­
ders.26 Conversely, using hospital admission data available 
through Brazil’s Unified Health System, Barcellos and col­
leagues27 documented a threefold rise in cases of Guillain–Barré 
syndrome in the northeastern region of Brazil after recognition 
of the outbreak, and a twofold increase in hospital admissions 
for encephalitis, myelitis and encephalomyelitis.27 Although the 
proclivity of Zika virus to infect neural tissue is now well 
described, the full range of clinical manifestations from such 
neurotropism have yet to be elucidated. This challenges our 
ability to adequately counsel patients on risk and prognosis. In 
our small cohort, neurologic complications arose during the 
acute phrase rather than in convalescence, which is atypical of 
post­infectious Guillain–Barré syndrome and polyneuropathy. In 
a patient with neurologic manifestations, particularly meningo­
encephalitis, and illness clinically compatible with Zika, imaging 
of the brain and spine, nerve conduction studies and collection 
of cerebrospinal fluid for cytology, biochemistry and PCR are 
appropriate investigations beyond what would be routinely 
done to exclude Zika virus infection.
Congenital and sexual transmission were observed in our 
cohort. We documented congenital transmission in at least 2 
of 3 travellers with Zika who were pregnant. In addition, we

documented 1 case of sexual transmission coincident with 
conception. Furthermore, 80% of women with Zika were of 
child­bearing age. The frequency and severity of the newly 
described congenital Zika syndrome5,6 dictates that women 
who are pregnant avoid travel to areas with ongoing transmis­
sion of Zika virus,28 and those planning to conceive should con­
sider deferring travel.28 The risk of sexual transmission of Zika 
virus can be reduced through use of condoms and absti­
nence,28 although because of prolonged seminal shedding, 
practical algorithms for the prevention of sexual transmission 
remain challenging.
The epidemiologic features of imported Zika virus among 
Canadians seen at CanTravNet sites may have changed with 
maturation of the Americas outbreak. Phylogenetic analysis has 
confirmed the introduction of Zika virus to Brazil in 2013.1 How­
ever, specific diagnostic testing for Zika virus became available 
in Canada only in early 2016.28 In the first half of the study 
period in our analysis, the burden of Zika virus was borne by 
people travelling to the Americas, particularly South America, 
for the purpose of visiting friends and relatives; in the latter 
half, coincident with the increased spread of Zika throughout 
the Caribbean and Central America, the burden was borne 
more often by tourists travelling to the Caribbean. This finding 
may reflect travel proclivities among groups of travelling Can­
adians, seasonality of mosquitoes according to precipitation, or 
declining transmission rates in regions involved in the early 
stages of the epidemic. However, it may also reflect more wide­
spread and protective seroconversion among travellers visiting 
family and friends, who tend to travel repeatedly, stay abroad 
for longer periods (thereby increasing their chances of infective 
mosquito bites) and interact more with local residents, who 
themselves are accumulating immunity but are also a potential 
source of sexual transmission. At this point, the durability of 
protection conferred by neutralizing antibody titres in travel­
lers is unknown. However, based on experience with other flavi­
viruses, it is presumed to be prolonged, if not lifelong. Despite 
large volumes of Canadians travelling to Florida, no cases were 
observed from this region.
Fewer than 1 in 5 travellers with Zika virus infection in our 
analysis had positive results from both serologic and molecular 
testing. Current Zika testing algorithms in Canada support the use 
of both serologic and nucleic acid–based tests for confirmation of 
acute infection,28 with molecular testing of serum performing best 
within the first 5 days of illness, and serologic testing increasing in 
sensitivity beyond day 7 of illness. Beyond 14 days of illness, test­
ing algorithms support use of isolated serologic testing,28 unless 
the patient is pregnant, which can lead to prolonged viremia 
and detection of viral RNA in serum.29,30 Our data support the 
2­pronged testing approach in acute illness, because neither PCR 
nor serologic testing was sufficiently sensitive for diagnosis in iso­
lation. However, our documentation of viremia in 64% of travel­
lers with Zika who presented in the early convalescent phase (10–
30 d after symptom onset) counters the general recommendation 
to avoid PCR beyond 14 days of illness. Our analysis highlights 
how testing criteria may evolve over time. Newer serologic tests 
that are designed to minimize cross­reactivity with other flavivi­
ruses and that can be deployed closer to the point of care are cur­
rently being evaluated.31,32 Implementation of such tests would 
facilitate access to diagnostic testing and reduce the turnaround 
time of results.
Limitations
Analysis of CanTravNet data has several limitations, which have 
been described previously.14 The current analysis pertains only 
to the sample of ill travellers who presented to a CanTravNet 
site for care of Zika virus acquired in the Americas. Thus, our 
conclusions may lack generalizability to other Canadian travel­
lers and to those travelling outside the Americas. Our findings 
may also lack generalizability to people living in endemic areas. 
Our database likely underrepresents the actual burden of Zika 
among ill travellers returning from the Americas because of the 
prolonged turnaround time of Zika virus serologic testing. It is 
highly probable that many more ill travellers who were entered 
into our database with “suspected” or “probable” Zika virus, or 
“viral syndrome” will be confirmed to have Zika virus in the 
future. Moreover, those who acquired mild or asymptomatic Zika 
virus infection during long­duration travel may not be repre­
sented in our database, because they may be less likely to seek 
care upon return. 
Some CanTravNet sites offer rapid assessment of febrile trav­
ellers from the affiliated emergency departments, which may 
bias the data toward those with undifferentiated febrile illness 
presenting early in the course of their disease.

We could not estimate incidence rates or destination­specific 
numerical risks for Zika because of the absence of a total denomi­
nator of travellers to the Americas.33 The Winnipeg site was new to 
CanTravNet in 2016, and at the time of writing, it had not contrib­
uted cases to the database. Similarly, there are no CanTravNet 
sites in the Maritime provinces. 
Our study was of a 1­year duration. Thus, our conclusions 
around shifting temporal epidemiologic characteristics of Zika 
virus infection may be limited and need to be corroborated by 
analyses of longer duration. 
Finally, our clinic sites primarily serve adult returned travel­
lers. As such, pediatric cases are likely underrepresented.
Conclusion
We have documented the full clinical spectrum of acute Zika 
virus infection in 12% of all such cases imported to Canada from 
the Americas over a 1­year period, including adverse fetal and 
neurologic outcomes, as well as sexual transmission. Dengue is 
one of the most common causes of fever in returned travellers, 
and over our study period, Zika was encountered as frequently 
as dengue at the CanTravNet sites, which highlights the emer­
gence of this arboviral pathogen in the mobile Canadian popula­
tion. Prevention of transmission rests on mosquito­avoidance 
measures, which may include travel deferral, and on barrier pro­
tection during sexual activity.
