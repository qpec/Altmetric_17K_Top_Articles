Are Autistic Traits Associated with Suicidality? A Test of the
Interpersonal-Psychological Theory of Suicide in a Non-Clinical
Young Adult Sample
M. K. Pelton and S. A. Cassidy
Autism spectrum conditions (ASC) has recently been associated with increased risk of suicidality. However, no studies
have explored how autistic traits may interact with current models of suicidal behavior in a non-clinical population.
The current study therefore explored how self-reported autistic traits interact with perceived burdensomeness and
thwarted belongingness in predicting suicidal behavior, in the context of the Interpersonal-Psychological Theory of
Suicide (IPTS). 163 young adults (aged 18–30 years) completed an online survey including measures of thwarted
belonging and perceived burdensomeness (Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire), self-reported autistic traits (Autism
Spectrum Quotient), current depression (Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale), and lifetime suicidality
(Suicide Behavior Questionnaire-Revised). Results showed that burdensomeness and thwarted belonging significantly
mediated the relationship between autistic traits and suicidal behavior. Both depression and autistic traits signifi-
cantly predicted thwarted belonging and perceived burdensomeness. Autistic traits did not significantly moderate the
relationship between suicidal behavior and thwarted belonging or perceived burdensomeness. Results suggest that the
IPTS provides a useful framework for understanding the influence of autistic traits on suicidal behavior. However, the
psychometric properties of these measures need be explored in those with clinically confirmed diagnosis of ASC.

Lay Summary: Recent research has shown that people with high autistic traits are more likely to attempt suicide.
However, no studies have explored why. We found that people with high autistic traits were more likely to experi-
ence feelings that they do not belong in the world, are a burden on others, and depression, which may increase their
likelihood of attempting suicide. These results suggest that promoting inclusion and independence in those with
high autistic traits could help prevent people attempting suicide.

Introduction
Suicide is the leading cause of death for men and
women in the UK aged between 20 and 34 [Office for
National Statistics, 2015]. Often termed a ‘preventable’
form of death, suicide is a complex phenomenon influ-
enced by biological, social, and environmental factors
making it stubbornly hard to predict [Walter & Prid-
more, 2012; World Health Organization, 2012]. Recent
research indicates an association between autistic traits
and suicidality in clinical samples with and without
diagnosis
of
an Autism
Spectrum
Condition
(ASC)
[Cassidy et al., 2014; Takara & Kondo, 2014]. However,
no studies have yet explored associations between autis-
tic traits and suicidality in a non-clinical population, or
how existing models of suicidality may interact with
autistic traits (Cassidy and Rodgers, 2017). This is cru-
cial to understand why people with high autistic traits
may be at increased risk of suicide, and develop new
effective assessment, support and treatment approaches
for these individuals.
Autistic traits characteristic of ASC are normally dis-
tributed in the general population without an ASC diag-
nosis, termed the broader autism phenotype [Piven,
Palmer, Jacobi, Childress, & Arndt, 1997]. For example,
individual differences in ability to interact and commu-
nicate with others, imagination, attention to detail, and
tendency to have narrow obsessive interests [Baron-
Cohen, Wheelwright, Skinner, Martin, & Clubley, 2001;
Ruzich et al., 2015a]. The employment of a dimensional

 rather than categorical approach reflects current thinking
that ASC diagnosis represents the extreme end of cogni-
tive and behavioral differences distributed at various lev-
els across the general population [Constantino & Todd,
2005; Hoekstra, Bartels, Hudziak, Van Beijsterveldt, &
Boomsma, 2007; Baron-Cohen et al., 2001; Sucksmith,
Roth, & Hoekstra, 2011]. Such traits are recognized to
increase susceptibility to poor social and functioning out-
comes and reduced coping strategies at sub-clinical as
well as clinical levels [Best, Moffat, Power, Owens, &
Johnstone, 2008; Kanne, Christ, & Reiersen, 2009]. For
example, difficulties in social and communication skills
could increase risk of experiencing social isolation [Ors-
mond, Shattuck, Cooper, Sterzing, & Anderson, 2013],
which could in turn lead to secondary depression [Cas-
sidy et al., 2014]. Depression and social isolation are sig-
nificant risk factors for death by suicide in the general
population [e.g., Kasper, Schindler, & Neumeister, 1996;
Barraclough, Bunch, Nelson, & Sainsbury, 1974]. Are
autistic traits therefore also associated with increased risk
of suicidality in a non-clinical sample?
Research has shown that autistic traits increase risk of
suicidality in those with clinically confirmed diagnosis
of ASC [Cassidy et al., 2014], and depressed patients
without ASC [Takara & Kondo, 2014]. These results sug-
gest that increased levels of autistic traits in clinical
populations with and without clinically confirmed ASC
increase risk of experiencing suicidality. Additional evi-
dence for an association between autistic traits and sui-
cidality is that those with confirmed diagnosis of ASC,
at the extreme end of the autism phenotype, are at sig-
nificantly increased of suicidality compared to other
groups. Up to 66% of adults with ASC have contem-
plated suicide in their lifetime, significantly higher than
the general population (17%) and patients with psychosis
(59%) [Cassidy et al., 2014]. Suicide is a leading cause of
premature mortality in those with ASC [Hirvikoski et al.,
2015]. However, it is unknown whether autistic traits are
also a risk factor for suicidality in non-clinical populations
without a diagnosis of ASC, or how models explaining
suicidality in the general population may interact with
autistic traits in a non-clinical sample. Many psychiatrists
are not trained in recognizing autistic traits, which can
impede patients’ access to appropriate support and treat-
ment to prevent death by suicide [Raja, Azzoni, & Frus-
taci,
2011].
Elucidating
risk
markers
for
suicide
in
individuals with high autistic traits would therefore aid
assessment and treatment of suicide risk in a large section
of the population.
This study will be the first to explore these associations
in relation to suicidal behavior in the broader autism phe-
notype. Due to its strong emphasis on social functioning,
the framework of the Interpersonal-Psychological Theory
of Suicide (IPTS) is employed (Fig. 1). Non-clinical sam-
ples are widely employed as proxy for clinical samples in
model testing studies. Models to date have explored asso-
ciations between autistic traits and (for example) social
anxiety,
loneliness,
and
social
relationships
[Jobe
&
White, 2007; Lamport & Zlomke, 2014], bullying [Kuni-
hira, Senju, Dairoku, Wakabayashi, & Hasegawa, 2006]
quality of life, stress levels and impaired coping styles
[Pisula, Danielewicz, Kawa, & Pisula, 2015], and depres-
sive symptoms [Jackson & Dritschel, 2016]. This study
represents the first that has considered suicidal behavior,
a high-risk area for research where there are currently no
models validated for use in ASC populations.
IPTS argues that the strongest predictors of suicidal
behavior are mental health conditions, previous suicide
attempts, social isolation, family conflict, unemploy-
ment, and physical illness. However, many experience

INSAR
 these high-risk factors and do not consider or attempt
suicide [Van Orden et al., 2010]. The IPTS therefore
argues that the social impact of negative life events and
broader risk factors constitute distal risk factors for sui-
cide. Suicide ideation is however activated via two prox-
imal social risk factors: (i) an absence of reciprocal
social relationships termed ‘thwarted belonging’; and
(ii) the perception that one has become a hopeless bur-
den on family and friends termed ‘perceived burden-
someness’ [Joiner, 2007; Van Orden et al., 2010]. These
two factors constitute the focus of this study. The pres-
ence of a single social factor represents passive suicide
ideation but the presence of both activates suicide idea-
tion termed ‘the desire to die’. For a suicide attempt to
be made a third variable ‘the acquired capability for sui-
cide’ is required [Joiner, 2007; Van Orden et al., 2010].
See Figure 1.
The IPTS suggests that the nature of different mental
health conditions influence their relationship with sui-
cidal behavior [Joiner, 2007; Van Orden et al., 2010].
For example, conditions affecting social interaction and
liability to others, such as depression, increase the like-
lihood that one will experience thwarted belonging and
perceived burdensomeness [Davidson, Wingate, Grant,
Judah, & Mills, 2011; Kleiman, Liu, & Riskind, 2014;
Silva, Ribeiro, & Joiner, 2015]. Autistic traits have not
been considered in IPTS research to date. However,
observable behaviors which indicate the presence of the
psychological
state
of
thwarted
belonging—self-
reported loneliness, few social supports, relationship
breakdown, absence of life partner—are widely associ-
ated
with
high
autistic
traits
[Causton-Theoharis,
Ashby,
&
Cosier,
2009;
Chamberlain,
Kasari,
&
Rotheram-Fuller, 2007; Chen, Bundy, Cordier, Chien, &
Einfeld, 2015; Chown & Beavan, 2012]. Additionally,
observable behaviors indicative of perceived burden-
someness, such as unemployment [Riedel et al., 2015],
physical illness [Hirvikoski et al., 2015], family burden
[Cadman et al., 2012; Croen et al., 2015], low self-
esteem [Williamson, Craig, & Slinger, 2008], and agita-
tion [e.g., McGonigle, Venkat, Beresford, Campbell, &
Gabriels, 2014] are also associated with high autistic
traits. Hence, it is possible that high levels of autistic
traits may also be associated with increased suicidal
behavior due to increased thwarted belonging and per-
ceived burdensomeness.
There
is
also
an
established
association
between
depression and suicidal behavior via thwarted belong-
ing and perceived burdensomeness [Cole et al., 2013;
Davidson et al., 2011; Joiner, 2007; Van Orden et al.,
2010; Van Orden, Witte, Gordon, Bender, & Joiner,
2008]. Depression increases the experience of thwarted
belonging due to symptoms of social disconnectedness.
Individuals
may
experience
difficulties
with
life
achievements due to experiential avoidance, fatigue,
motivational or concentration difficulties leading to
increased feelings of burdensomeness [Davidson et al.,
2011]. These may in turn increase perception of needi-
ness leading to (inaccurate) negative projections of self
onto those close by; a perception of being a hopeless
burden to family and friends [Joiner, 2007].
The IPTS argues that co-morbid diagnoses change the
relationship with suicidal behavior due to an interac-
tion of symptoms. Understanding these associations is
important for designing effective clinical interventions
[Silva et al., 2015]. For example, a diagnosis of co-
morbid depression and generalized anxiety disorder
would increase suicide ideation but lower levels of capa-
bility reducing imminent risk [Silva et al., 2015]. Risk of
depression increases with higher levels of autistic traits
in the general population [Jackson & Dritschel, 2016].
Depression may also be exacerbated by the presence of
autistic traits. For example, increased tendency for
repetitive behavior, cognitive rigidity and difficulties in
attention switching may increase risk of rumination
(passive and internal problem solving without reference
to solutions) [Cassidy et al., 2014; Gotham, Bishop,
Brunwasser, & Lord, 2014]. Depressive symptoms and
autistic traits may therefore interact; i.e., increased
depressive symptoms may lead to observable increases
in autistic traits [Andersen, Skogli, Hovik, Egeland, &
Øie, 2015]. IPTS argues that the most dangerous form
of thwarted belonging is where a limited social network
and cognitive barriers to participation are accompanied
by low mood [Van Orden et al., 2010]. Hence, increased
levels of autistic traits may amplify the experience of
depression leading to increased thwarted belonging.
Therefore, one might expect that depression in the
presence of high autistic traits together may more
strongly predict higher levels of thwarted belonging
than either of these two variables alone. By contrast,
perceived burdensomeness relies on ability to put one-
self in another’s shoes, and adopt their perspective
[termed a ‘theory of mind’; Baron & Frith, 1989] in
order to successfully recognize that one constitutes a
burden on others. Suicidal behavior in those with high
autistic traits may therefore be hastened by the opposite
process, that is, an inability to see that one’s death will
affect others [Hannon & Taylor, 2013]. Therefore autis-
tic traits and depression may influence perceived bur-
densomeness independently of one another.
However, autistic traits are associated with difficulties
that may impede ability to experience, and/or effec-
tively report on feelings of thwarted belonging and per-
ceived
burdensomeness.
For
example,
in
order
to
believe that one is burden on others, you must first be
able to take their perspective (they think I am not con-
tributing), and attribute a belief (they think I am a bur-
den on them) on the basis of this. Difficulties in taking
another’s perspective and subsequently attributing a

 belief, (termed a theory of mind) are commonly associ-
ated with high autistic traits and ASC [Baron-Cohen,
Leslie & Frith, 1989]. Hence it is possible that those with
high autistic traits may have difficulty contemplating
whether or not they are a burden on others. In the IPTS,
thwarted belonging stresses social connectedness. Those
with high autistic traits may avoid social situations and
the anxiety this causes. The extent this impacts mental
health may be affected by the extent to which the indi-
vidual craves social connections. If the constructs of the
IPTS do not effectively apply to the case of high autistic
traits, then we would expect that the strength of the asso-
ciation between these factors with suicidality could be
attenuated at high levels of autistic traits. This could offer
some insight into a potentially different route to depres-
sion and suicide in those with high autistic traits.
The present study aimed to test these predictions,
thereby addressing a gap in the literature in our under-
standing of how autistic traits in a non-clinical sample
may be associated with suicidal behavior [Hannon & Tay-
lor, 2013; Segers & Rawana, 2014]. Firstly, this study will
examine the relationship between autistic traits and sui-
cidal behavior through the proximal risk factors for sui-
cidal behavior set out in the IPTS [Joiner, 2007; Van
Orden et al., 2010]. Specifically, this study hypothesizes
that the relationship between autistic traits and suicidal-
ity will be significantly mediated by thwarted belonging
and perceived burdensomeness. Secondly, this study will
consider
the
well-established
relationships
between
depression and both thwarted belonging and perceived
burdensomeness [e.g., Cole et al., 2013; Davidson et al.,
2011], by examining whether these relationships are
moderated by autistic traits. Specifically, this paper
hypothesizes that depressive symptoms and autistic traits
will interact to increase the experience of thwarted
belonging. By contrast, perceived burdensomeness will
be predicted by depressive symptoms and autistic traits
but there will be no interaction. Lastly, this study will
explore
the
well-established
respective
relationships
between thwarted belonging and perceived burdensome-
ness and suicidal behavior [Joiner, 2007; Van Orden
et al., 2010], by considering whether these are moderated
by high levels of autistic traits. Specifically, this paper
hypothesizes
that
perceived
burdensomeness
and
thwarted belonging will each constitute a weaker predic-
tor of suicidal behavior at high levels of autistic traits.
Method
Participants
Participants were undergraduate students and members
of the general population (n 5 163, 65% female, aged
18–30 years (mean age 5 21.58 years)) (Table 1).
Students were recruited via the Coventry University
psychology research participation scheme and via adver-
tising posters placed around campus. Members of the
general population were recruited via the Cambridge
Autism Research Database (CARD), posters placed in
community organizations and via social media channels.
Materials
AQ. The Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ) is a 50-item
self-report questionnaire [Baron-Cohen et al., 2001].
Scores range from 0 to 50, with higher scores indicating
higher levels of self-reported autistic traits. The AQ has
strong evidence for its psychometric properties, reliably
distinguishing those with and without ASC [Baron-
Cohen et al., 2001; Ruzich et al., 2015a], and is an
acceptable screening instrument prior to ASC diagnosis

 INQ-15.
The

Needs
Questionnaire
(INQ-15) is a 15-item self-report questionnaire assessing
the two interpersonal constructs that describe the men-
tal state required for desire to die; ‘Thwarted Belonging’
and ‘Perceived Burdensomeness’ [Van Orden, Cukro-
wicz, Witte, & Joiner, 2012]. The INQ-15 has strong evi-

validated in young adults [Van Orden et al., 2012]. For
burdensomeness subscale alpha 5 .936. For belonging

CESD-R.
The
Centre

Depression Scale Revised (CESD-R) is a validated 20-
item scale used to assess severity of depressive symp-
toms in line with the American Psychiatric Association
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual V [Eaton, Smith,
Ybarra, Muntaner, & Tien, 2004]. It comprises nine sub-
scales: dysphoria (sadness), anhedonia (loss of interest),
appetite, sleep, thinking/concentration, guilt, fatigue,
agitation, and suicide ideation. Respondents indicate
on a five-point scale how many days in the last 2 weeks
they have been experiencing each symptom [Eaton
et al., 2004]. Scores range from 0 to 60 with scores over
16
indicating
clinically
significant
depression.
The
CESD-R has strong evidence for its psychometric prop-
erties, and has been validated for use in general popula-

SBQ-R. The Suicide Behaviors Questionnaire-revised
(SBQ-R) is a validated 4-item self-report questionnaire
that assesses lifetime suicidal behavior, suicide ideation
over the past 12 months, threat of suicide attempt, and
likelihood of suicidal behavior in the future. This study
employed question 1 of the SBQ-R: ‘Have you ever
thought about or attempted to kill yourself?’ There are
six possible responses from ’never’ to ’I have attempted
to kill myself and really hoped to die’ with responses
grouped into one of four categories: ’non-suicidal’, ‘sui-
cidal ideation’, ‘suicide plan’, and ’suicide attempt’. The
first item of the SBQ-R has been validated for use in
general population samples to reliably distinguish those
who have and have not previously attempted suicide
[Osman et al., 2001].

Participants
indicated
their age, ethnic origin, living and work status, develop-
mental history, and mental health diagnoses (Table 1).
Ethical Approval
The current study received ethical approval from Cov-
entry University Psychology Ethics Committee, and was
approved by the scientific advisory group at the Autism
Research Centre, University of Cambridge, prior to
recruiting
participants
registered
in
the
Cambridge
Autism Research Database (CARD).
Procedure
Participants were invited to complete an online survey
using Bristol Online Survey tool. Participants read the
participant information and indicated informed con-
sent to participate via an online form. Participants were
fully briefed about the nature of the research, that they
could skip questions that made them feel uncomfort-
able, and were provided information about relevant
support services before and after taking part in the
study.
Results
Analytic Approach
Anonymised data were exported into SPSS version 22
for analysis. Simple mediation models explored whether
the relationship between autistic traits and suicidal
behavior were mediated by perceived burdensomeness
and thwarted belonging, using SPSS custom dialogue
box PROCESS [Field, 2009; Hayes, 2013], as in previous
similar studies [e.g., Cole et al., 2013]. Hierarchical
regressions explored whether autistic traits moderated
associations between depression with burdensomeness
and
belonging,
and
whether
associations
between
thwarted
belonging,
perceived
burdensomeness
and
lifetime suicidality were attenuated at high levels of
autistic
traits.
The
Johnson-Neyman
technique
was
employed to identify regions of significance in signifi-
cant interaction effects.
Descriptive Statistics
Data
from
the
SBQ-R
was
significantly
skewed
(skew 5 3.38), which was not successfully corrected by
either square root or log transformation. The INQ is
designed to be non-normally distributed in the general
population as it measures experiences and feelings that
are rare [Van Orden et al., 2012]. Analyses were there-
fore
undertaken
using
bootstrapping
techniques,
a
robust analysis technique which is reliable even when
assumptions of a symmetric distribution are not met
[Field, 2009]. Utilizing this robust analysis technique
did not alter the pattern of results, with similar direc-
tion and magnitude of effects and statistical signifi-
cance found using bootstrapping or normal analytic
approach, therefore untransformed results are reported
for ease of interpretation.
All variables—autistic traits, depression, belonging,
and
burdensomeness—were
significantly
correlated
with lifetime suicidal behavior (Table 2). Mean AQ
score in this sample was 18.2, similar to the general
population mean of 16.7 [Ruzich et al., 2015b], and stu-
dent sample mean of 17.6 [Baron-Cohen et al., 2001].
Clinically relevant AQ scores (AQ � 26) were reported
by 15.7% of the sample. Prevalence of lifetime suicide

 plan was 19.6%, and suicide attempts 8.6% of the cur-
rent sample, similar to prevalence rates found in gen-
eral
and
university
populations
[2.5–10%
suicide
attempts; Nock et al., 2008; Kessler, Borges, & Walters,
1999; O’Carroll, 1992].

through bootstrapping procedures [Field, 2009; Hayes,

traits (R2 5 .078, F(1,161) 5 13.68, P 5 .001), Perceived
burdensomeness (R2 5 .376, F(1,161) 5 96.921, P 5 .001),

densomeness (b 5 .021 BCa CI [.011, .033]), with a

thwarted belonging and perceived burdensomeness as
the outcome variables. To statistically control for these
variables, age and gender were entered into the first
step. The second step comprised the main effects of
autistic traits and depression, and the third step the
interaction effect. All independent variables were mean
centered to avoid issues of collinearity in the interac-
tion effect [Field, 2009] (Table 3).
Thwarted belonging. In step 1, a model containing
age and gender did not significantly predict thwarted
belonging (F(2,160) 5 .179, P 5 .836). In step 2, depres-
sion and autistic traits each significantly predicted
thwarted
belonging
(F(4,158) 5 34.008,
P 5 .001)
accounting for 46.3% of the variance. In step 3, the
addition of the interaction effect between autistic traits
and depression significantly accounted for a further
1.6% of the variance (F(5, 157) 5 28.904, P 5 .026).
This interaction effect is illustrated in the scatterplot
in Figure 4. The relationship between depression and
thwarted belonging is illustrated at high (�26) and low
(<26) levels of autistic traits. As depicted in Figure 4,
the
relationship
between
depression
and
thwarted
belonging is stronger at low levels of autistic traits than
at high levels of autistic traits.
Perceived burdensomeness. In step 1, a model con-
taining age and gender significantly predicted perceived
burdensomeness (F2,160)5 6.608, P5 .002). In step 2, the
main effect of depression and autistic traits significantly
predicted
perceived
burdensomeness

the addition of the interaction effect between autistic traits
and depression did not significantly increase the prediction
of burdensomeness (F(1,141)5 28.883, P5 .000).
Are Associations between Perceived Burdensomeness and
Thwarted Belonging with Suicidal Behavior Attenuated in
Those with High Levels of Autistic Traits?
The PROCESS model for moderation was employed as it
encompasses the Johnson–Neyman (JN) technique to
identify regions of significance within the continuum
of autistic traits, in this case to specifically assess
whether there is any difference in effect at high (clini-
cal) levels of autistic traits [Field, 2009; Hayes, 2013].
Simple slopes were analysed at high, mean, and low
values of the moderator. The predictor variable (X) was
either thwarted belonging or perceived burdensome-
ness, the moderator (M) in each case was autistic traits
and the outcome variable was suicidal behavior (Y).
There was no significant moderating effect of autistic
traits on the relationship between perceived burden-
someness and suicidal behavior (b 5 2.001, 95% CI
[2.0024, .0024], t 5 2.705, P 5 .482). The output of the
JN technique showed that in this sample perceived bur-
densomeness significantly predicted suicidal behavior at
all levels of autistic traits.
The examination of simple slopes shows that burden-
someness significantly predicted suicidal behavior at
high (1SD above mean), (b 5 .065, 95%CI [.047, 0.082],
t 5 7.21,
P 5 .000),
medium
(b 5 .070,
95%CI
[.055,

mean) (b 5 .074, 95%CI [.052, .097], t 5 6.58 P 5 .000)
of autistic traits. The value of beta of the regression
equation increased as autistic traits decreased but this
did not reach statistical significance in the current
sample.
There was no significant moderating effect of autistic
traits on the relationship between thwarted belonging
and suicidal behavior (b 5 2.0003, 95%CI [2.002, .002],
t 5 2.269, P 5 .79). Examination of simple slopes shows
that thwarted belonging significantly predicted suicidal
behavior at high (1SD above mean), (b 5 .032, 95%CI

beta increased as autistic traits decreased this did not
reach statistical significance in the current sample.
Discussion
This study aimed to explore for the first time whether
autistic traits are associated with suicidality in a non-
clinical young adult sample, and how autistic traits
interact with two proximal factors of the IPTS in pre-
dicting suicidality; thwarted belongingness and per-
ceived
burdensomeness.
Results
showed
that
self-
reported autistic traits significantly predicted suicidal
behavior. This extends the limited body of research
showing associations between autistic traits and risk of
suicidality in clinical samples with and without ASC
[Takara & Kondo, 2014; Cassidy et al., 2014]. This find-
ing is also consistent with research indicating that high
levels of autistic traits could increase likelihood of expe-
riencing
risk
factors
for
suicidality.
For
example,
increased exposure to negative life events [Graetz, 2016;
Matthews et al., 2015; Pisula et al., 2015; Schmidt et al.,
2015], difficulties forming and maintaining social rela-
tionships
and
support
networks
[Causton-Theoharis
et al., 2009; Chamberlain et al., 2007; Chown & Bea-
van, 2012; Gray, 2012; Griffith, Totsika, Nash, & Has-
tings, 2012a]. Coping strategies to effectively deal with
life challenges could also be reduced by difficulties in
imagination, and ability to think flexibly [Pisula et al.,
2015, Pollmann, Finkenauer, & Begeer, 2010; Schmidt
et al., 2015].
In line with predictions, results showed that the rela-
tionship between autistic traits and suicidal behavior
was mediated by the two social risk factors of the IPTS:
perceived
burdensomeness
and
thwarted
belonging.
These findings are consistent with the principles of the
IPTS, which argue that distal risk factors, in this case
autistic traits, influence suicidal behavior via the proxi-
mal risk factors: thwarted belonging and perceived bur-
densomeness [Joiner, 2007; Van Orden et al., 2010].
Models containing each factor recorded medium effect
sizes indicating a promising insight into understanding
how autistic traits may be associated with suicidal
Figure 4.

tic traits in the prediction of thwarted belonging.

 behavior. Results are thus consistent with the interpre-
tation that autistic traits increase vulnerability to expe-
riencing
perceived
burdensomeness
and
thwarted
belonging.
Results showed a significant indirect effect of autistic
traits on suicidal behavior through thwarted belonging
in line with our predictions from the IPTS. Thwarted
belonging places the absence of reciprocal social rela-
tions in a central role in suicidal behavior [Joiner, 2007;
Van Orden et al., 2010]. This is consistent with the
widely documented association between autistic traits
and reduced reciprocity leading to self-report loneliness
and limited social network [Chamberlain et al., 2007;
Gray, 2012; Griffith et al., 2012a; Usher, Burrows,
Schwartz, & Henderson, 2015; van Ommeren, Begeer,
Scheeren, & Koot, 2012; White & Roberson-Nay, 2009].
Personal and social functioning challenges are attrib-
uted to the core difficulties of social cognition, which
provide
the
stable
barriers
to
social
participation
described in the IPTS [Joiner Jr et al., 2009; Joiner,
2007; Van Orden et al., 2010].
There was a significant indirect effect of autistic traits
on suicidal behavior through perceived burdensome-
ness. This is in line with findings that autistic traits are
associated with caregiver burden, unemployment and
poor self-esteem, core components of Van Orden et al’s
(2010) observable behaviors of perceived burdensome-
ness [Cadman et al., 2012; McGonigle et al., 2014;
Scott, Falkmer, Girdler, & Falkmer, 2015; Yang & Wang,
2014]. The association of burdensomeness with suicidal
behavior is highly pertinent due to its established rela-
tionship with lethal suicide methods [Ciubara et al.,
2015; Hannon & Taylor, 2013; Segers & Rawana, 2014].
However, consideration should be given to the possibil-
ity that autistic traits may lead to under-reporting of
burdensomeness given known difficulties in
under-
standing others’ point of view [termed a Theory of
Mind; Baron-Cohen, Leslie, & Frith, 1989]. This model
could be expanded, in particular, to include aspects of
other co morbid diagnoses, especially anxiety disorders,
and environmental factors.
In line with predictions results showed that there was
a significant interaction between depressive symptoms
and autistic traits in the prediction of thwarted belong-
ing. Both depression and high autistic traits are typified
by social difficulties: social withdrawal, loneliness, isola-
tion, and relationship difficulties. Autistic traits and
depressive symptoms are also seen to exacerbate one
another [Ghaziuddin, Ghaziuddin, & Greden, 2002;
Gotham, Unruh, & Lord, 2015; Matson & Williams,
2014]. Those who find social interaction challenging
are likely to avoid social interaction, struggle to express
themselves and to seek support leading to increased
depressive
symptoms
[Hallett,
Ronald,
Rijsdijk,
&
Happ�
e, 2010]. However, the direction of interaction
was
surprising;
increasing
levels
of
autistic
traits
appeared to reduce rather than exacerbate the experi-
ence of thwarted belonging. This could indicate a dia-
metric effect; that is, autistic traits alleviate symptoms
of depression reversing negative social consequences,
such as withdrawal. An alternative explanation would
be that autistic traits may lead to under-reporting on
the thwarted belonging subscale of the Interpersonal
Needs
Questionnaire.
Items
such
as
‘these
days
I
belong’ or ‘these days, I’m close to other people’ require
abstract language and pragmatics, which are core lan-
guage difficulties associated with autistic traits [Roth,
2010]. This reflects current research reporting substan-
tial challenges in measuring depression in the context
of high autistic traits due to over-lapping symptoms
and increased rates of alexithymia [Bird & Cook, 2013;
Cassidy et al., 2014; Gotham et al., 2015]. Hence, high
levels of autistic traits could reduce the ability to effec-
tively articulate one’s feelings of thwarted belonging.
Autistic traits and depressive symptoms both signifi-
cantly predicted perceived burdensomeness but there
was no interaction effect between these two variables.
This suggests that both depression and autistic traits
provide separate, additive contributions to the experi-
ence of perceived burdensomeness. For example, autis-
tic
traits
are
particularly
associated
with
increased
support needs regardless of depressive symptoms, such
as unemployment, poor self-esteem, and caregiver bur-
den [Hendricks, 2010; McDonough & Revell, 2010;
Scott et al., 2015, Myers, Ladner, & Koger, 2011; Parsi &
Elster, 2015; Ar�
an-Filippetti & Krumm, 2013; Bekhet,
Johnson, & Zauszniewski, 2012; Cadman et al., 2012;
Griffith, Totsika, Nash, Jones, & Hastings, 2012b]. By
contrast deep depression is particularly associated with
negative self-perceptions, where feelings of poor self-
worth trigger excessive reassurance seeking that one is
truly valued and subsequent rejection [Cole et al., 2013;
Hill & Pettit, 2014, Jahn, Cukrowicz, Mitchell, Poin-
dexter, & Guidry, 2015; Nsamenang, Webb, Cukrowicz,
& Hirsch, 2013]. It is unlikely that autistic traits would
exacerbate these types of interpersonal symptoms of
depression that rely on reciprocity due to theory of
mind difficulties. However, the concept of perceived
burdensomeness is described as a form of ‘extreme
social ineffectiveness’ leading to two behavioral compo-
nents: firstly, the perception of being a burden on
others, as described above and secondly, intense self-
hatred, poor self-esteem, and agitation [Joiner, 2007;
Van Orden et al., 2010]. In the presence of theory of
mind difficulties it is conceivable that this second com-
ponent may be present in the absence of verbal expres-
sion of the former. This would be consistent with
internalizing symptoms, physiological, and behavioral
changes noted to associate depressive symptoms with
autistic traits [Ghaziuddin et al., 2002; Gotham et al.,
INSAR
Pelton and Cassidy/Are Autistic Traits Associated with Suicidality?
1899
 2015; Matson & Williams, 2014]. Future research could
consider to what extent this is the case and how effec-
tively this second component is captured by current
measures. This reflects broader calls in the literature to
improve the reliability and validity of the measurement
of burdensomeness through development of measures
that do not rely solely on verbal self-report [e.g., Hill &
Pettit, 2014].
The current study predicted that high levels of autis-
tic traits would attenuate the relationship between per-
ceived burdensomeness and thwarted belonging with
suicidality. However, no significant moderation effect
was found. This suggests that the capacity of the IPTS
in predicting suicidality remains consistent at both
high and low levels of autistic traits in a non-clinical
sample. This echoes findings from a wide range of other
clinical populations, which have found that the ‘desire
to die’, represented by perceived burdensomeness and
thwarted belonging, significantly predicted suicide idea-
tion when controlling for other risk factors [Barzilay
et al., 2015; Bryan, Hernandez, Allison, & Clemans,
2013].
The
results
showed
a
trend
for
decreasing
strength in the relationship between burdensomeness/
thwarted belonging and suicidal behavior at the highest
level of autistic traits in the current sample. This reflects
research
indicating
difficulties
reporting
emotional
states in those with high autistic traits [Bird & Cook,
2013; Greenberg et al., 2006]. Difficulties in reporting
emotional
states,
theory
of
mind
difficulties
and
abstract language ability may lead to a different inter-
pretation of statements such as ‘These days, the people
in my life would be better off if I were gone’ or ‘These
days I think I am a burden on society’.
This study has a number of strengths. It is the only
study to date which has explored how autistic traits
interact with well validated risk factors in predicting
suicidal behavior, in a non-clinical sample. The limited
number of available studies in this area have all been
small scale and/or utilized clinical samples, without
systematically
exploring
risk
or
protective
factors
according to a well-defined and validated theoretical
framework [Cassidy and Rodgers, 2017; Segers & Raw-
ana, 2014]. It therefore addresses an under-researched
area—suicidality and autistic traits, and contributes to
the development of a robust theoretical framework to
understand and explore suicide in those with and with-
out ASC. This is crucial to explore whether autistic
traits are a risk marker for suicide in the wider popula-
tion, and why, prior to further application in those
with confirmed diagnosis of ASC.
This study also has some limitations. It utilized mea-
sures of self-reported autistic traits (AQ), suicidality
(SBQ-R), depression (CESD-R), perceived burdensome-
ness and thwarted belonging (INQ). However, all have
undergone
substantial
reliability
tests
and
have
excellent
psychometric
properties
[Ruzich
et
al.,
2015a,b; Osman et al., 2001; Eaton et al., 2004; Van
Orden et al., 2012]. The study drew on a largely female
undergraduate sample. This limits the generalizability
of results to the wider general population, and possibly
to those with ASC. However, recent research has indi-
cated that ASC may be under-diagnosed in females
[Rynkiewicz et al., 2016; Rutherford et al., 2016], and
that females diagnosed with ASC, without co-morbid
intellectual disability, are at higher risk of dying by sui-
cide than males [Hirvikoski et al., 2015]. Hence, it is
important to explore associations between autistic traits
and suicidality in females, without intellectual disabil-
ity as this is particularly high-risk group for death by
suicide in the ASC population. This study was cross-
sectional, hence results from the mediation analyses
must be interpreted with caution. Future research will
need to conduct longitudinal studies to confirm results
from the mediation analyses in the current study,
regarding
whether
perceived
burdensomeness
and
thwarted
belongingness
mediate
the
association
between autistic traits and suicidal behaviors. However,
results from regression analyzes demonstrate that autis-
tic traits, thwarted belonging and perceived burden-
someness
are
associated
with
each
other,
and
all
significantly predict suicidal behavior.
In summary, this is the first study to use well-
validated measures to explore the relationship between
autistic traits and suicidal behavior within a robust the-
oretical framework: the IPTS. This study provides the
first evidence of an association between autistic traits
and suicidal behavior in a non-clinical sample, and pro-
vides new avenues for exploring and understanding sui-
cide in those with and without ASC. Within this study,
autistic traits do not appear to influence the relation-
ship between perceived burdensomeness and thwarted
belonging with suicidality, suggesting that these consti-
tute, on the face of it, accurate predictors of suicidal
behavior. Individuals with high levels of autistic traits
are more likely to experience depression, thwarted
belonging,
and
perceived
burdensomeness,
thereby
increasing their risk of attempting suicide. Clinicians
need to be aware of autistic traits, how they manifest
and lead to increased risk of suicide. Improving inclu-
sion, sense of belonging, and independence in people
with high levels of autistic traits, could reduce prema-
ture death by suicide in a significant number of people.
