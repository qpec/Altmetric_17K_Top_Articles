Abstract
Introduction: Once-daily tenofovir/emtricitabine-based pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) can reduce HIV acquisition in men who
have sex with men (MSM), by 44% in the iPrEx trial, and reaching up to 99% with high adherence. We examined the potential
population-level impact and cost-effectiveness of different PrEP implementation strategies.
Methods: We developed a dynamic, stochastic compartmental model of HIV transmission among the estimated 57,400 MSM in
Toronto, Canada. Parameterization was performed using local epidemiologic data. Strategies examined included (1) uniform PrEP
delivery versus targeting the highest risk decile of MSM (with varying coverage proportions); (2) increasing PrEP efficacy as a
surrogate of adherence (44% to 99%); and (3) varying HIV test frequency (once monthly to once yearly). Outcomes included HIV
infections averted and the incremental cost ($CAD) per incremental quality-adjusted-life-year (QALY) gained over 20 years.
Results: Use of PrEP among all HIV-uninfected MSM at 25, 50, 75 and 100% coverage prevented 1970, 3427, 4317, and 4581
infections, respectively, with cost/QALY increasing from $500,000 to $800,000 CAD. Targeted PrEP for the highest risk MSM at
25, 50, 75 and 100% coverage prevented 1166, 2154, 2816, and 3012 infections, respectively, with cost/QALY ranging from $35,000
to $70,000 CAD. Maximizing PrEP efficacy, in a scenario of 25% coverage of high-risk MSM with PrEP, prevented 1540 infections with
a cost/QALY of $15,000 CAD. HIV testing alone (Q3 months) averted 898 of infections with a cost savings of $4,000 CAD per QALY.
Conclusions: The optimal implementation strategy for PrEP over the next 20 years at this urban centre is to target high-risk MSM
and to maximize efficacy by supporting PrEP adherence. A large health benefit of PrEP implementation could come from
engaging undiagnosed HIV-infected individuals into care.

Introduction
HIV incidence among men who have sex with men (MSM) in
high-income countries remains high and concentrated in
large, urban settings [1�6]. In Canada, the incidence of HIV
infection among MSM ranges from 0.62 per 100 person-years
to 1.14 per 100 person-years, similar to the ranges in other
developed countries [2�6]. In 2014, 837 new HIV infections
were diagnosed in the province of Ontario, with half occurring
in Canada’s largest city, Toronto [5,6]. Of the estimated 57,400
MSM living in Toronto, nearly 20% have HIV [1]. Despite
the scale-up of a combination anti-retroviral therapy (ART)
and sustained investments in behavioural prevention pro-
grammes [7,8], the rates of newly diagnosed HIV infections
and HIV-attributable deaths in Toronto MSM have not
markedly declined over the last 10 years, and remain a major
public health concern [1]. Daily use of tenofovir/emtricitabine
(Truvada †) by HIV-uninfected individuals as pre-exposure
prophylaxis (PrEP) has been shown in randomized trials to
reduce HIV acquisition in high-risk groups [9�11]. The iPrEx
study, a placebo-controlled trial in high-risk MSM, found that
those randomized to tenofovir/emtricitabine were 44% less
likely to acquire HIV compared to placebo over a median
follow-up of 1.2 years [9], and pharmacokinetic analyses
suggest efficacy of up to 99% if adherence is high [12].
More recent data from the iPrEx open-label extension
corroborate this estimate, with dosing of four to seven times
per week associated with virtually 100% (95% CI�86,100%)
efficacy [13]. To inform broader PrEP implementation, addi-
tional demonstration projects are underway across North
America, including the US PrEP community-based demonstra-
tion project out of New York City, an NIH-funded community-
based project out of San Francisco [14], and PREPARATORY-5
(NCT02149888), a demonstration project in Toronto evaluat-
ing PrEP acceptability, effectiveness and sexually transmitted
infection rates. To contextualize the findings of these regional
demonstration projects and prepare for wide-scale PrEP

 delivery, we need to understand how to maximize its
population-level impact on HIV transmission in large, urban
centres, given the added cost to the healthcare system.
Dynamic mathematical models of the population impact of
PrEP on HIV spread among MSM have been developed on
both national and sub-national scales in high- [15�19] and
low-income regions [20]. Five modelling studies of high-
income countries suggest that PrEP is most cost-effective
when restricted to the highest risk subgroups [15�19].
Not surprisingly, these studies also showed that uptake
and adherence would have large effects on predicted HIV
outcomes. However, key implementation questions remain
unanswered. For instance, although clinical guidelines recom-
mend that HIV testing be done every three months in
individuals using PrEP on the basis of the protocols used in
clinical trials, the optimal HIV screening frequency remains
unclear. It is also unclear what proportion of the total benefit
of PrEP programmes accrues from the ability of PrEP-related
HIV testing to diagnose infections earlier, versus from the use
of PrEP itself. Furthermore, most models of PrEP population-
effectiveness and/or cost-effectiveness in high-income set-
tings examined national-level epidemics by drawing on
national-level sexual behaviour and HIV surveillance data
[15,17�19]. However, a national perspective belies the hetero-
geneity in HIV epidemics between locales, such as states,
provinces or major cities [4]. Furthermore, HIV prevention
programmes are often funded and administered at a regional
level [6,21]. There is often marked heterogeneity of pre-
valence and rates of HIV infection/diagnosis across regions
within countries, and comparing metropolitan and non-
metropolitan regions [22,23]. Regional models of PrEP may
thus offer a more relevant assessment of implementation
costs and outcomes for the purpose of guiding local interven-
tions, and may be more generalizable to regions with similar
epidemic characteristics. To date, there has been no model-
based evaluation of PrEP implementation in a Canadian city.
To address these gaps, we developed a mathematical
model of HIV spread in Toronto MSM using the best available,
regional epidemiologic data. Our aim was to evaluate the
impact of different strategies of PrEP delivery in Toronto MSM
on the following outcomes: reduction in the total number of
diagnosed and undiagnosed HIV infections, total number
of HIV-related deaths averted, incremental costs and cost
per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained, over a 20-year
period. Strategies examined included targeting PrEP at the
highest risk MSM (with varying proportions of coverage) and
varying the frequency of HIV screening in those on PrEP. We
further assessed the sensitivity of outcomes to varying rates
of adherence.
Methods
Model design
We developed a dynamic, deterministic-stochastic hybrid
compartmental model of HIV spread among MSM in
Toronto, Canada. The model was represented by a combined
deterministic-stochastic model [24] of state-transitions based
on the probability of moving from one compartment to
another. The transitions were stochastic for compartment
population sizes fewer than 5000 individuals, and were
deterministic for compartments exceeding 5000 individuals.
The motivation for using a stochastic approach was to better
accommodate relatively small population sizes within com-
partments that would be encountered in a regional model.
A deterministic function was used to accommodate the
few compartments that would have a consistently higher
population, allowing improved computational efficiency. For
this analysis, we chose to present mean values, corresponding
to repeated realizations of the model.
Figure 1 shows the schematic of the model structure, while
Table 1 shows the parameter values. Model compartments
reflected the natural history (or ‘‘states’’) of untreated and
treated HIV, and populations were further stratified by
known/unknown HIV serostatus and sexual behaviour (high/
low risk). The natural history of untreated HIV was divided
into four progressive stages reflecting data from untreated
HIV-infected cohorts [25]. Each stage was associated with a
different probability of infectiousness and HIV-attributable
mortality (Table 1), and defined by time to specific CD4
cell counts [25]: (1) acute seroconversion; (2) CD4�500
cells/mm3 as early disease; (3) CD4 200 to 500 representing
late HIV and (4) CD4B200 representing AIDS. The model
represented an open population of MSM. HIV-uninfected
men entered the model at a rate maintaining 1% popula-
tion growth. HIV-uninfected and HIV-infected MSM left the
modelled population at compartment-specific rates, with
mortality dependent upon the stage of infection.
The sexual behaviour of high-risk MSM was drawn from the
annual number of sexual partners taken from regional empiric
data (using the highest decile of the reported number of
sexual partners in the last year). These data were collected
from MSM undergoing anonymous HIV testing at a downtown
Toronto sexually transmitted infection clinic in Spring 2013
and suggested that the highest decile of MSM had a mean of
36 partnerships in the last year [26]. The remainder had a
mean of five partnerships in the last year. For this aforemen-
tioned study, research ethics board approval was obtained
from the University of Toronto, protocol #30129. Consent for

 the use of these data was obtained at the time of entry into
the study. Data analysis performed for this study was done
using anonymous and deidentified data.
HIVserostatus was based on an individual’s awareness of his
diagnosis of HIV. We assumed that HIV infectivity decreased
after a diagnosis of HIV infection, based on behaviour change

 observed in population-based studies [27]. The reduction in
infectivity was operationalized as a reduced probability of
transmission between HIV-infected and uninfected indivi-
duals, reflecting either increased use of condoms or seropo-
sitioning favouring lower transmission, but not a change in the
number of partners.
HIV transmission between compartments was a function
of the following variables (Table 1): (1) the number of sexual
partners per individual per annum; (2) condom use, which
was combined with condom efficacy; (3) HIV transmission
probability based on HIV stage, awareness of HIV serostatus
and HIV treatment status and (4) PrEP use, which decreased
HIV susceptibility (per sex act) but did not impact on the
number of partners.
Individuals who were diagnosed with HIV could initiate
ART at a rate that varied depending upon CD4 stage, as
described below. Similarly, individuals who were on ARTcould
discontinue treatment and return to the diagnosed, infected,
but untreated population with CD4�500. In the intervention
scenarios, PrEP could be initiated among HIV-uninfected
individuals. If taking PrEP, the likelihood of acquiring HIV
infection per act was reduced by 44% (unless otherwise
evaluated). If individuals became infected with HIV while on
PrEP, they were infectious while undiagnosed (with no effect
of PrEP on HIV infectivity). Once diagnosed, they moved into
the diagnosed HIV category. We did not incorporate the
potential impact of PrEP use on emergence of antiretroviral
drug resistance.
Epidemiological and behavioural data for model
parameterization
Toronto-specific epidemiologic data was used wherever
possible for parameters and initial conditions (Table 1,
Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). Baseline (non-HIV) mortality
rates were based on average North American life expectancies
[28], and adjusted based on expected increased mortality in
late-stage (CD4B200) HIV infection [15]. The probability of
HIV transmission, as a function of the stage of CD4 count
(transmissions per partnership per year) was drawn from the
literature [15,29�31].The annual HIV testing rate among MSM
in Toronto was estimated by dividing the mean annual number
of HIV tests performed in Toronto MSM by the estimated
population of undiagnosed MSM [1]. We used an annual
1% population growth rate of susceptible MSM, in keeping
with Canadian population growth rates [32]. Individuals on
ART were assumed to be fully adherent and non-infectious
[33]. Estimated rates of condom use and efficacy, used for
calibration, were based on published values and local data
[1,34,35].
Cost and quality of life data
Cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted from the health-
systems perspective and included costs associated with
inpatient and outpatient clinical care and diagnostics. PrEP,
ART and HIV/AIDS related care costs were drawn from
previous studies based on Canadian estimates, and included
physician-visit and nursing costs, acute hospitalization costs,
diagnostic testing and prescription costs [36,37]. Specific
diagnostic testing costs in susceptible individuals were
determined based on provincial (Ontario) cost listings for
HIV serology as of July 2013 [37]. Estimates of stage-specific
QALYs
lost/gained
among
persons
with
HIV/AIDS
and
those on ART were determined from the literature [38].
We assumed that PrEP did not affect quality of life. In
evaluating cost-effectiveness, we determined the total health
care related costs, as well as costs associated with PrEP
implementation, HIV treatment related costs, untreated HIV-
associated costs, HIV testing costs among the susceptible
population and QALYs. QALYs were calculated at each time
step of the model. Costs and QALYs were discounted at a rate
of 3% per annum.
Model calibration
We calibrated the model at an equilibrium state against the
following historical estimates (10-year period in Toronto, 2001
to 2011) using acceptance-rejection sampling: (1) a stable
annual HIV diagnosis rate (330 to 400 cases per annum) and
(2) a stable annual HIV-attributable mortality (58 to 72 cases
annually) [1,39]. Parameter values were selected using Monte-
Carlo sampling.The calibrated parameters are listed in Table 1,
and included those about which we were most uncertain
and those expected to influence study outcomes the most:
ART initiation and cessation rates, reduction in risky sexual
behaviour after HIVdiagnosis, AIDS mortality, condom use and
efficacy. We cross-validated the model-generated HIV pre-
valence ratio (high-risk versus low-risk population), against
local data on HIV prevalence among the 10% of MSM with the
highest risk of HIV (using syphilis co-infection as a risk factor)
compared to the lowest-risk 90%, which was a ratio of 3 [35].
Analyses
We used the accepted parameter sets to simulate the base-
line scenario (without PrEP), and different strategies of PrEP
delivery. PrEP was introduced at an HIV-equilibrium state
and outcomes were measured at 20 years. Because we were
interested in the mean outcome per parameter set (i.e., the
average of a large number of stochastic realizations), we
performed 150 stochastic realizations per parameter set to
ensure the mean incidence of diagnosed and undiagnosed HIV
infections varied less than 1% with each additional simulation.
Outcomes included the impact of daily PrEP on cumulative
number of newly diagnosed and undiagnosed HIV infections,
the cumulative number of HIV-associated deaths, annual
costs and cost per QALY. Newly diagnosed infections included
those individuals who were already infected at the start of
the simulation, and then were subsequently diagnosed. We
compared the following PrEP implementation strategies: (1)
targeting all MSM (high- and low-risk sexual activity) versus
only high-risk activity MSM alone, with varying proportions
of coverage; (2) varying the frequency of HIV testing in those
taking PrEP including the scenario in which screening is
performed without PrEP use and (3) increasing PrEP efficacy
(as a surrogate for adherence) based on pharmacokinetic
analyses from the iPrEx trial, from 44% risk reduction
(corresponding to fewer than two doses per week), to 76%
(two doses per week), 96% (four doses per week), and 99%
risk reduction (seven doses per week) [12]. We then
conducted a sensitivity analysis to explore the influence
of changing coverage in an ideal adherence scenario (99%
efficacy).

 Results
In the absence of PrEP, the model estimated 8378 new HIV
infections and 1567 HIV-attributable deaths over 20 years. Of
the new HIV infections, 30% were acquired by high-risk
MSM. The prevalence ratio of high to low-risk was 3, in
keeping with the increased risk of infection in the high-risk
population [35].
Risk targeting
Over 20 years, PrEP use in 25, 50, 75 and 100% of MSM
prevented 1970, 3427, 4317, and 4581 new HIV infections,
and 110, 182, 222, and 236 HIV-associated deaths. The
estimated cost of implementing PrEP increased as more men
used PrEP, from $1.36 billion CAD with 25% PrEP coverage to
$4.37 billion CAD with 100% PrEP coverage. Total QALYs
gained varied from 2673 to 5430, and cost per QALY gained
varied from $495,175 to $792,763 CAD with 25% to 100%
PrEP coverage, respectively (Table 2).
In contrast, restricting PrEP to the highest risk decile of
HIV-uninfected MSM at 25, 50, 75 and 100% coverage was
estimated to prevent 1166, 2154, 2816, and 3012 new HIV
infections, and 70, 117, 137, and 140 HIV-associated deaths
over 20 years. The cost of targeting PrEP at the highest risk
MSM increased from $80 million CAD with 25% PrEP coverage
to $269 million CAD with 100% PrEP coverage. Total QALYs
gained varied from 1417 to 2951, and cost per QALY gained
varied from $34,999 to $68,203 CAD with 25% to 100% PrEP
coverage respectively (Table 2). Incremental cost-effectiveness
(cost per QALY gained) was greatest when PrEP use was
restricted to the high-risk MSM (Figure 2).
Increasing PrEP coverage in high-risk MSM (25%, 50%,
75%, 100%) under the assumption of 99% efficacy (and ideal
adherence scenario) prevented more infections (1540, 2881,
3827, 4095), prevented more HIV-associated deaths (87, 152,
182, 196), led to more QALYs gained (1852, 3286, 4033, 4108)
and produced improved cost per QALY ($15,275, $24,099,
$35,682, $44,427 CAD).
Clinical implementation parameters
To evaluate the impact of HIV testing frequency and PrEP
efficacy among PrEP users, we assumed a baseline scenario in
which 25% of high-risk MSM used PrEP.When keeping efficacy
fixed at 44%, changing the frequency of HIV testing in those on
PrEP had minimal influence on the number of HIV infections
prevented over 20 years (1209 to 1113 HIV infections
prevented with Q1 month versus Q12 month testing,
respectively). Similarly, costs and cost-effectiveness did not
significantly change with variation in testing frequency (Table
3). However, when keeping test frequency fixed at Q3 months,
increasing PrEP efficacy from 44% to 99% resulted in a marked
increase in infections prevented, from 1166 to 1540. Cost-
effectiveness improved with cost per QALY gained, decreasing
from $34,999 to $15,275 CAD (Table 3). Finally, in the scenario
of 25% coverage of high-risk HIV-uninfected MSM, we
considered the option of HIV screening only and no PrEP
administration. This resulted 898 infections prevented, 1164
QALYs gained and a cost savings per QALY gained of $4,332
CAD.
Discussion
In this regional model of HIV transmission, we found that PrEP
implementation in all MSM, irrespective of risk profile,
provides important reductions in HIV infections and mortality.
Increasing the frequency of HIV testing in susceptible indi-
viduals on PrEP resulted in minimal improvement in the
number of infections averted, even when testing monthly.
When compared to established cost-effectiveness thresholds
($20,000 to $100,000 CAD per QALY) [41], general PrEP
delivery to high- and low-risk MSM was not cost-effective.
Focusing PrEP on the highest risk HIV-uninfected MSM
was a more efficient strategy than targeting all high and low
risk at comparable levels. Specifically targeting a fraction of
highest risk MSM (25% coverage) was the most cost-effective
option, with a cost per QALY of approximately $35,000 CAD,
similar to values previously described in the literature for
comparable populations [15,16]. This occurs because even
with 25% PrEP coverage, few high-risk MSM (in absolute
numbers) remain susceptible to HIV. In contrast, improving
PrEP efficacy in high-risk individuals, via better medication
adherence [12,13], increased cost-effectiveness. Recent em-
pirical studies suggest the potential for even better efficacy
than the 44% efficacy reported in iPrEX [42]. With 99%
efficacy, increasing PrEP coverage in high-risk MSM showed
even less costs per QALY that could be achieved. Under-
standing a community’s high-risk population (its relative size
and relative HIV risk) will be important in guiding endpoints
for PrEP implementation programmes, such that coverage
targets can be set that optimize cost-effectiveness.
Increasing the frequency of HIV testing in susceptible
individuals on PrEP resulted in minimal improvement in the
number of infections averted, even when testing monthly.
This is because most new infections still occur in non-users
when PrEP efficacy is moderate to high. Decreasing the

7
 frequency of testing (outside of guideline recommendations
of every three months) suggests minimal cost savings and
modestly more infections. There has also been documented
drug resistance in breakthrough infections [43]. Together,
these suggest that it may be more efficient to focus efforts
on PrEP adherence rather than testing frequency if there are
little marginal benefits.
Given the cost savings of approximately $4,000 CAD per
QALY of HIV testing alone in high-risk populations, our
findings suggest a potentially large collateral health benefit
of PrEP programmes via engaging more high-risk MSM in
routine HIV testing, even if they do not ultimately take PrEP.
This is likely occurring due to both behavioural changes in
those who are diagnosed with HIV and early initiation of ART,
both of which will lead to reduced transmission. Some of the
barriers to HIV screening among MSM include a belief that
they are not at risk for infection, fear of a positive test and
fear that other people might find out they are infected
[44�47]. Particularly because of its novelty, PrEP programmes
offer a new opportunity to engage these individuals in care
by providing a means through which they may reduce their
likelihood of infection, and potentially feel more comfortable
with routine screening. Retention in PrEP programmes,
regardless of PrEP initiation, may thus be an important
programmatic objective, given the significant cost benefit of
having regular screening in high-risk MSM.
Of note, with increased HIV testing in a PrEP programme,
the fraction of undiagnosed men with HIV declines, and the
number of new HIV diagnoses can outpace incident HIV
infections. Since HIV diagnoses are used for surveillance and
assessing response to interventions, this could misinterpret
the population-effectiveness of PrEP programmes. There may
be increased HIV cases diagnosed due to increased HIV
testing, especially early in the PrEP programme. Similarly,
observed declines in new diagnoses may underestimate true
declines in new HIV infections.
Limitations
While a strength of this study is its regional focus, using a
city with epidemic features similar to other urban MSM
HIV epidemics [22,48], the findings must be interpreted in
this context and are conditional on the assumptions and
data inputs. First, we did not include female sexual partners
of MSM. Based on available data, the sexual structure of
the model did not detail a more nuanced sexual network
and behavioural heterogeneity. Second, we tested the PrEP
interventions under an endemic equilibrium, which was
supported by local stability in the rates of HIV diagnoses and
mortality in the last decade [1,4]. It is possible that this
equilibrium could be disrupted, and the cost-effectiveness of
PrEP may vary during periods of growing or declining
epidemics [49]. A third limitation is our assumption that the
cost of PrEP medication remains stable, even if adherence is
less than daily. Dosing PrEP as infrequently as four times
weekly has recently been estimated to still provide nearly
100% risk reduction among MSM [13]. Less frequent dosing
and the possibility of future reductions in PrEP drug costs
suggest the potential for further cost savings [12]. Fourth, the
cost-effectiveness could be overestimated by the low fre-
quency of HIV testing used for this population compared to
guidelines. However, the baseline HIV testing rate drew on
numbers of performed HIV tests and the susceptible popula-
tion size [1] and is corroborated by other studies of the same
population [35]. Fifth, cost-effectiveness ratios may be over- or
underestimated if the quality of life ratio for individuals on
PrEP is not equal to one � the value we used in the absence of
data to suggest otherwise. Lastly, we assumed ART adherence
in those with diagnosed HIV to be excellent and highly
effective, which is an increasing reality in the era of well-
tolerated once-daily dosing regimens in high-income settings
[50]. However, the assumption of perfect ART adherence for
those with HIV may overestimate the benefit of a testing-only
strategy, and underestimate the potential benefit of PrEP in
the susceptible population, whereby individuals with poor ART
adherence could actively transmit HIV, increasing the force of
infection.
Important next steps include an evaluation of the impact
of PrEP use on rates of ART resistance accumulation among
those who become infected while taking PrEP, as has preli-
minarily been explored in some models [51]. Further, given
the results of the placebo-controlled IPERGAY trial, in which
‘‘on-demand’’ PrEP (averaging roughly three to four tablets
weekly) was associated with an 86% risk reduction [52], future
work should assess how best to utilize daily and intermittent
PrEP strategies from both a preventive efficacy and cost-
effectiveness perspective. Lastly, although clinical data has not
suggested significant increases in risk behaviour on PrEP (‘‘risk
compensation’’ or ‘‘behavioural disinhibition’’) [13,14], the
clinical and cost-effectiveness impact of PrEP-related reduc-
tions in condom use and increased rates of other STIs warrant
further study [53].
Conclusions
Providing once-daily PrEP for HIV prevention among MSM
in a large, urban city could be associated with important
reductions in HIV infections and deaths from the use of PrEP
itself, and from newly engaging MSM in HIV care through
PrEP-related screening. The most efficient approach to PrEP
delivery would involve identifying high-risk MSM and aiming
for modest PrEP coverage, with a focus on maximizing PrEP
adherence over more frequent HIV testing.
