BACKGROUND: The current randomized trial examined the effects of a Tibetan yoga program (TYP) versus a stretching program
(STP) and usual care (UC) on sleep and fatigue in women with breast cancer who were undergoing chemotherapy. METHODS:
Women with stage (American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM) I to III breast cancer who were undergoing chemotherapy
were randomized to TYP (74 women), STP (68 women), or UC (85 women). Participants in the TYP and STP groups participated in 4
sessions during chemotherapy, followed by 3 booster sessions over the subsequent 6 months, and were encouraged to practice at
home. Self-report measures of sleep disturbances (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), fatigue (Brief Fatigue Inventory), and actigraphy
were collected at baseline; 1 week after treatment; and at 3, 6, and 12 months. RESULTS: There were no group differences noted in
total sleep disturbances or fatigue levels over time. However, patients in the TYP group reported fewer daily disturbances 1 week after
treatment compared with those in the STP (difference, -0.43; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], -0.82 to -0.04 [P 5.03]) and UC (dif-
ference, -0.41; 95% CI, -0.77 to -0.05 [P 5.02]) groups. Group differences at the other time points were maintained for TYP versus
STP. Actigraphy data revealed greater minutes awake after sleep onset for patients in the STP group 1 week after treatment versus
those in the TYP (difference, 15.36; 95% CI, 7.25-23.48 [P 5.0003]) and UC (difference, 14.48; 95% CI, 7.09-21.87 [P 5.0002]) groups.
Patients in the TYP group who practiced at least 2 times a week during follow-up reported better Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and
actigraphy outcomes at 3 months and 6 months after treatment compared with those who did not and better outcomes compared
with those in the UC group. CONCLUSIONS: Participating in TYP during chemotherapy resulted in modest short-term benefits in
sleep quality, with long-term benefits emerging over time for those who practiced TYP at least 2 times a week. Cancer 2018;124:36-

INTRODUCTION
Although chemotherapy for breast cancer improves disease-free and overall survival, toxicities remain high and impact
quality of life.1,2 Sleep disturbances and fatigue, often ranked as the most problematic side effects of treatment,3,4 are espe-
cially debilitating. Specific rates of fatigue are hard to estimate from previous studies due to different measures used and a
lack of clinical specificity. Nevertheless, one cohort study of 218 women reported that at the end of treatment, 26% of the
sample experienced case rates of fatigue and 16% of the sample reported case rates of fatigue plus mood disturbances.5
Some studies also have shown only modest increases in fatigue.6 In addition, fatigue levels do not appear to be linear in
nature. For example, 2 longitudinal studies revealed that women demonstrated a marked increase in fatigue during cycle
1, which then decreased, yet peaked during cycle 4.7,8 The prevalence of sleep disturbance appears to be higher, with esti-
mates ranging between 30% and 75%,9,10 yet with some studies demonstrating stable levels.7
Yoga is an effective modality with which to reduce symptoms pertaining to sleep disturbances and fatigue for cancer
survivors who have completed cancer treatment. A large multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving 410
survivors (75% of whom had breast cancer) with sleep disturbances found that an 8-session yoga intervention improved

 both objective and subjective sleep quality compared with a
group receiving usual care (UC).11 Two smaller trials con-
ducted in survivors of breast cancer after completing treat-
ment, 1 of which was a single-arm study12 and the other
comparing yoga with a health education control group,13
found that yoga was effective at reducing persistent fatigue
that was maintained at 3 months after the intervention.
Although research has examined the effects of yoga
delivered during chemotherapy for women with breast
cancer,14-24 to the best of our knowledge only one study
to date was designed to specifically target fatigue and none
have targeted sleep outcomes. Taso et al16 conducted a
small RCT comparing yoga with UC for women with
breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy and found
reduced fatigue compared with UC, which demonstrated
increased fatigue. Other studies have examined sleep and
fatigue as secondary outcomes. Improvement in fatigue
was noted in 2 small single-arm studies21,25 and only for
within-group analyses in RCTs22 and for those attending
more yoga classes.24 Similarly, a small RCT by Dhruva
et al14 found that the amount of yoga practice during che-
motherapy was associated with decreased sleep distur-
bance. Our prior work of a Tibetan yoga program (TYP)
for patients with lymphoma who were either undergoing
treatment or within 12 months of completing treatment
found that the program resulted in fewer sleep disturban-
ces compared with a wait-list control group.26 A subse-
quent trial for women with breast cancer found that TYP
led to reduced sleep disturbances and fatigue27 for women
who were undergoing chemotherapy at the time of deliv-
ery of the intervention.
Previous yoga research has not typically included
active control groups or long-term follow-up, thereby lim-
iting the interpretation of the findings. The current trial
was designed to address the limitations of previous studies
and to further our knowledge regarding the effective man-
agement of sleep disturbances and fatigue in women with
breast cancer
actively receiving
chemotherapy.
We
hypothesized that the TYP group would have lower sleep
disturbances and fatigue than an active stretching pro-
gram (STP) group and a UC wait-list control group (UC)
because the TYP integrates physical movements with spe-
cific breathing exercises and meditative stress reduction
techniques.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population
Women with stage (American Joint Committee on Cancer
(AJCC) TNM) I to III breast cancer who were undergoing
chemotherapy and were aged �18 years; were able to read,
write, and speak English; and were scheduled to undergo
neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy (weekly or every 21
days) at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer
Center were enrolled. Patients with lymphedema, deep
vein thrombosis, a documented diagnosis of a formal
thought disorder (eg, schizophrenia), a score of �23 on the
Mini-Mental State Examination, extreme mobility prob-
lems limiting their ability to engage in the practices (self-
defined), or those who had regularly (self-defined) prac-
ticed yoga in the year before diagnosis were excluded. The
protocol was approved by The University of Texas MD
Anderson Cancer Center Institutional Review Board, and
patients were recruited between 2007 and 2012.
Procedures
Women were approached either before starting or within
the first 2 cycles of chemotherapy. Chemotherapy con-
sisted of neoadjuvant or adjuvant paclitaxel given weekly
for 12 cycles or every 3 weeks for 4 cycles or neoadjuvant
docetaxel given every 3 weeks for 4 cycles followed by 5-
fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FAC)/
5-fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FEC)
every 3 weeks for 4 cycles. Therefore, the majority of
patients completed the TYP or STP intervention sessions
within the first 12 weeks of chemotherapy and before ini-
tiation of FAC/FEC. After providing written informed
consent, participants completed a 60-minute baseline
assessment and wore an actigraphy watch 24 hours per
day for 7 days to assess sleep quality. Participants then
were randomized to 1 of 3 groups (TYP, STP, or UC),
using a form of adaptive randomization, minimization,28
with age, stage of disease, time since diagnosis, baseline
fatigue scores, menopausal status, type of surgical proce-
dure, and chemotherapy treatment and regimen as ran-
domization
factors.
Follow-up
assessments
were
conducted 1 week after the end of the intervention and 3,
6, and 12 months later. Participants were given a gift cer-
tificate with a $25 value after completing each assessment.
Participants in the UC group completed all assessments
on the same timeline as the active groups. STP and UC
group participants were offered yoga classes at the end of
their study participation. All participants were asked to
refrain from participating in any other yoga classes while
on study or to report it if they did practice.
Intervention Programs
Participants in the TYP and STP groups attended 4 classes
of 75 to 90 minutes each during their chemotherapy treat-
ment. The majority of classes were delivered in a 1-on-1

 format to meet each patient’s unique schedule. Patients
also were encouraged to practice daily outside of the clas-
ses at the hospital. Patients in both interventions were
given printed materials, audio recordings, and a video of
all the techniques. Both groups also had 3 booster sessions
during follow-up. The manualized interventions are avail-
able upon request.
Tibetan yoga program
Each TYP class was taught by 1 of 4 trained instructors
from the Ligmincha Texas Institute, with continuity of
instructor for each patient. TYP instructors had at least 3
years of practice experience and received relevant oncol-
ogy training as well as specific training for teaching the
TYP protocol to patients with breast cancer.
TYP consisted of 4 main components: 1) mindful-
ness and focused attention through guided meditation
with breathing and visualization; 2) an alternate nostril
breathing practice (9 breathings of purification) and a
breath retention exercise (eg, 4-part breath); 3) Tsa Lung
movements; and 4) closing with a brief compassion-based
meditation. Tsa Lung26 is an ancient Tibetan contempla-
tive practice that includes a series of 5 gentle movements
involving rotations and stretches of different parts of the
body coordinated with specific breathing patterns.
Stretching program
A physical therapist and an exercise physiologist taught the
majority of the STP classes, with <10% of the sessions
taught by a mind-body instructor, with continuity of
instructor for each patient. Instructors had > 10 years of
experience. STP included exercises recommended specifi-
cally for women undergoing or recovering from breast can-
cer treatment.29,30 The exercises included standing, lying
down, and sitting positions and approximated the gross
movements of the TYP (eg, horizontal arm stretch, breast
stroke, neck stretch, and a quarterback throwing a football).
Outcome Measures
Demographic and medical data were collected and
extracted from the medical records.
Primary intervention outcomes: self-report
Sleep disturbances were assessed using the Pittsburgh
Sleep Quality Index (PSQI).31 The PSQI is an 18-item
self-rated questionnaire that assesses quality of sleep and
sleep disturbances over a 1-month period. The scale
includes 3 component subscales of sleep efficiency, per-
ceived sleep quality, and daily disturbances, and a total
score, with scores of �5 indicating clinically significant
sleep disturbances.31
Fatigue was assessed using the Brief Fatigue Inven-
tory (BFI).32 The BFI is a 9-item questionnaire designed
to be used in the clinical setting to rapidly assess fatigue
severity. The items are ranked from 0 to 10, and patients
rate their fatigue at its “worst” and “usual” and as it is
“now,” with 0 indicating “no fatigue” and 10 indicating
“fatigue as bad as you can imagine,” and how much their
fatigue has interfered with their life.
Secondary intervention outcomes: objective
measures
Objective sleep patterns were measured with actigraphy.
Participants were instructed to wear actigraphs on the
wrist of their nondominant arm for 24 hours for 7 days at
each study time point. Data were collected in 15-second
epochs for the entire 7 days. Weekly aggregate scores for
daily data are presented for measures of sleep efficiency
(the percentage of time asleep during the sleep episode),
onset latency (the number of minutes it takes to fall
asleep), total sleep time, and wake after sleep onset
(WASO) (number of minutes awake during the night
after initial sleep onset).
Out-of-class practice
Out-of-class practice was encouraged for participants in
the TYP and STP groups, and patients reported their out-
of-class practice each week during the intervention phase
and then at each follow-up assessment that asked about
practice during the previous week.
Data Analyses
The primary outcomes were self-reported sleep disturban-
ces and fatigue. When the sample size in each of the 3
groups is 100, a 1-way analysis of variance will have 81%
power to detect at the 0.05 level a difference in the means
of each outcome characterized by a variance of means of
0.034, assuming that the common standard deviation is
1.0. As an example, the variance of means of 0.034 may
be characterized by means of 0, 0.39, and 0.39, respec-
tively, across the UC, STP, and TYP groups. Although we
recognized that the power calculation was based on 1 out-
come at 1 time point (specifically, 1 week after the inter-
vention), with a significance level of 0.05, we considered
it appropriate to make a Bonferroni adjustment for the
analyses of the PSQI and BFI total scores to reduce
inflated type I errors, yielding an alpha level of .025 for
each outcome. Main analyses were based on observed data
from women who were randomized and met the study eli-
gibility criteria, and were performed with multilevel
modeling using PROC MIXED (9.2.2 version; SAS Insti-
tute Inc, Cary, NC). These analyses allowed between-

 group comparisons of the outcomes of interest, not only
across time points but also at specific time points as post
hoc analyses, when desirable. We assumed a random
intercept in the model, and randomization factors were
entered as a priori covariates in all main analyses (stage of
disease, type of surgery, chemotherapy regimen, timing of
chemotherapy, menopausal status, age, and time since
diagnosis). Time point was treated as a categorical vari-
able. We examined the group main effect while control-
ling for baseline scores of the outcome. For the secondary
outcomes of PSQI subscales and actigraphy, we used a
conventional alpha level at .05. CONTRAST statements
were used within the mixed procedure to test for group
differences. If there was no significant group main effect
or contrast comparison effect noted, we then examined
the interaction of the group multiplied by the time using
CONTRAST statements to determine whether there
were significant group differences at a given time point
and reported on the effect size estimates. Model assump-
tions were examined by plotting histograms and quantile-
quantile plots of the studentized residuals from the mixed
models. In the event model assumptions were not met, a
log or square root transformation was applied, as
appropriate, with the corresponding results briefly sum-
marized, yet with the untransformed data being presented
for the results to be comparable to those in the literature.
RESULTS
Baseline Characteristics of Sample
We approached 933 potentially eligible patients (Fig. 1),
of whom 132 were ineligible, 349 refused participation,
and 452 consented. Of those, 352 patients completed
baseline measures and were randomized. Of those patients
randomized, 54 had completed chemotherapy at baseline
and 71 did not provide any follow-up data, resulting in an
evaluable sample of 227 participants. The dropout rate
was similar in each group. Chi-square and Student t tests
comparing baseline demographic and medical characteris-
tics and outcome measures of study completers versus
noncompleters demonstrated no significant differences,
with the exception of PSQI total score (F value, 4.26;
P 5 .04); completers had lower PSQI scores (less sleep
disturbance) compared with noncompleters. Activity
monitor data were missing for 31% of participants (71
participants) who returned questionnaires. No significant
group differences were found with regard to demographic

 and medical factors (Table 1) or any of the baseline study
variables. There were no group differences noted based on
when patients underwent surgery compared with their
participation in the study (11.5% before, 52.0% during,
and 36.6% after).
Completion of Interventions
A total of 54 participants (73% of the baseline sample)
completed all 4 TYP sessions, 6 completed 3 sessions, 5
completed 2 sessions, and 8 completed only 1 session. Of
the STP participants, 50 (74% of the baseline sample)
completed all 4 sessions, 7 completed 3 sessions, 5 com-
pleted 2 sessions, and 5 completed only 1 session. Approxi-
mately 63% of the participants in the TYP group said they
practiced �2 times a week 1 week after the end of the pro-
gram, as did 38.3% at 3 months, 41.3% at 6 months, and
20.5% at 12 months. STP participants reported high levels
of practice at each follow-up time point: 69.4% at 1 week
and 45.4% at 3 months, 61.5% at 6 months, and 50.0% at
12 months. Adherence to the booster sessions was lower for
both groups. Of the 74 participants in the TYP group,
51% did not have any booster classes, 24% had 1 booster
class, 16% had 2 booster classes, and 8% had all 3 booster
classes. Of the 68 participants in the STP group, 43% did
not have any booster classes, 31% had 1 booster class, 12%
had 2 booster classes, and 15% had all 3 booster classes.
There were no significant group differences noted with
regard to class attendance or frequency of practice during
the follow-up time period. There were no adverse events
found to be associated with either intervention.

 STP group (F value, 9.55; Least Square Mean (LSM):
2.26 for TYP vs 2.75 for STP [P 5 .002]), but neither
group differed from the UC group (LSM of 2.45). Con-
trast comparisons revealed that women in the TYP group
reported significantly fewer daily disturbances than
women in the STP and UC groups at 1 week (F value,
4.67 [P 5 .03; Cohen D, -0.41] and F value, 5.05
[P 5 .025; Cohen D 5 -0.39], respectively; LSM: 2.47
for TYP, 2.90 for STP, and 2.88 for UC). Contrast com-
parisons for the other time points are presented in Figure
2, demonstrating that group differences between TYP and
STP remained over time. The main effects, time multi-
plied by group interactions, and contrast comparisons
were not significant for sleep efficiency, perceived sleep
quality, or use of sleep medications. Effect size estimates
for the 1-week follow-up time point are presented in
Table 3.
Fatigue
There was a significant main effect of time (F value,
19.19; P<.0001), with significant increases in fatigue
observed at the 1-week and 3-month time points and
returning to baseline at 6 months and 12 months (Table
2). However, the group main effect (F value, 0.12;
P 5 .89), contrast comparisons, and the group multiplied
by time interaction (F value, 0.49; P 5 .82) were not
significant.
Actigraphy
Although the group main effect was not significant, there
was a significant group multiplied by time interaction for
WASO (F value, 2.50; P 5 .03). At 1 week, women in the
TYP and UC groups reported significantly shorter
WASO times compared with those in the STP group
(F value, 14.09 [P 5 .0003; Cohen D, -0.96] and F value,
15.09 [P 5 .0002; Cohen D, -0.91], respectively; LSM:
44.72 for TYP, 60.09 for STP, and 45.61 for UC), with
no differences noted at any of the other time points. For
sleep efficiency, there was no group main effect, but there
was a significant group multiplied by time interaction (F
value, 2.56; P 5 .02) (Table 2). Contrast comparisons
revealed that the TYP group had significantly higher sleep
efficiency than the STP group for 1 week (F value, 5.45
[P 5 .02]; LSM: 82.69 for TYP vs 80.02 for STP; Cohen
D, 0.53), with no differences noted between either group
and the UC group (LSM of 81.92) (Table 2). The histo-
grams of studentized residuals from the mixed models for
WASO and sleep efficiency appeared slightly right-
skewed and left-skewed, respectively. A log and a square
root transformation thus were applied to each of the out-
comes, respectively, resulting in approximate normality of
the residuals. After the log transformation for WASO, the
group multiplied by time interaction became nonsignifi-
cant, with the 1-week outcomes remaining the same. The
outcomes remained the same for sleep efficiency after a
square root transformation was applied. There was no
group main effect or group multiplied by time interaction
for sleep latency and total sleep time, and no contrast
comparisons were significant. Effect size estimates for the
1-week follow-up time point are presented in Table 3.

Exploratory analyses examined the association between
class attendance and out-of-class practice and outcomes,
covarying for baseline. The number of classes attended

 was not found to be associated with any of the outcomes;
however, there was little variance, because the majority of
the participants attended all 4 classes (72.97% in the TYP
group and 73.53% in the STP group). TYP participants
who indicated they practiced at least 2 times per week
compared with those who practiced less often reported
less daily disturbances at 3 months (LSM: 2.01 vs 2.66; F
value, 5.49 [P 5 .024; Cohen D, -0.74]) and better over-
all sleep quality (LSM: 5.01 vs 7.47; F value, 6.09
[P 5 .018; Cohen D, -0.78]), better sleep efficiency
(LSM: 0.53 vs 1.50 [P 5 .01]; F value, 6.86 [P 5 .01;
Cohen D, -0.82]), and better perceived sleep quality
(LSM: 2.10 vs 3.51; F value, 4.54 [P 5 .04; Cohen D, -
0.67]) at 6 months after treatment. A practice effect was
not found for those in the STP group for any outcome.
When we compared the TYP participants who practiced
at least 2 times per week with the UC group, we found
TYP participants reported fewer daily disturbances at 3
months (LSM: 1.97 for TYP vs 1.56 for UC; F value,
5.95 [P 5 .017; Cohen D, -0.67]) and better sleep effi-
ciency at 6 months (PSQI sleep efficiency subscale LSM:
0.45 for TYP vs 1.37 for UC; F value, 5.14 [P 5 .026;
Cohen D, -0.61]). Frequency of practice was not found to
be associated with BFI scores or actigraphy data.
Although there were no group differences noted
between participants with and without missing data
regarding demographic, medical, or the outcome variables
at baseline (except for PSQI total score), we imputed 20
values for the missing data using multiple imputations
(V9.2 MI procedure; SAS Institute Inc) with the Markov
chain Monte Carlo method and then used the MIANA-
LYZE procedure to generate statistical inferences. All the
analyses remained the same or resulted in similar P values.
DISCUSSION
We examined a TYP program targeting sleep disturbance
and fatigue in women undergoing chemotherapy for
breast cancer. Group differences mainly emerged when
comparing TYP with STP, suggesting that the STP partic-
ipants had worse daily sleep disturbances than TYP partic-
ipants and more minutes being awake after sleep onset
(WASO) than both TYP and UC participants, who did
not differ from each other except with regard to daily sleep
disturbances at the end of the program, with the differ-
ences disappearing over time. However, there were no sta-
tistically significant group differences noted for the
primary outcomes of total sleep disturbance and fatigue,
thereby limiting the clinical significance of the findings.
Sleep disturbance scores remained in the clinically signifi-
cant range over time and fatigue levels did increase
significantly during treatment, but then returned to base-
line levels by the 6-month and 12-month time points.
However, it was found that patients who reported practic-
ing TYP �2 times a week did have better sleep outcomes
than those who did not and better sleep outcomes com-
pared with those in the UC group 3 months and 6 months
after the program, with medium to large effect sizes.
A reason for the modest effects of TYP noted in the
current study compared with our past studies and those of
others examining the effects of yoga may be due to the fre-
quency of instruction and the timing of instruction. In
our prior studies of a similar TYP,26 our work with
Tibetan yoga for patients with lung cancer and their care-
givers,33 and our Indian-based yoga research, the patient-
instructor contact varied from a low of 7 weekly 60-
minute sessions26 up to 18 sessions of 60 minutes each (3
times a week for 6 weeks).34 In the current trial, patients
attended a maximum of 4 sessions of 90 minutes each.
The original trial design was to deliver 7 weekly 60-
minute sessions over 7 weeks. However, due to the fact
that many patients started to receive paclitaxel every 3
weeks instead of weekly, it became impractical to conduct
weekly sessions due to patients not wanting to come to the
hospital for their sessions. Future research ideally should
have a minimum of 6 weekly sessions so there is some con-
tinuity of practice. If shorter exposure is necessary, then it
is critical to ensure that patients are willing to engage in
the practices outside of class to enhance the benefits and
provide them with home-based support.
In fact, we did find that those patients who engaged
in the TYP �2 times per week did have better sleep out-
comes. This finding is consistent with other yoga studies
that found the frequency of practice was associated with
better outcomes.14,24,25 Although to our knowledge the
minimum frequency of yoga practice with which to
achieve positive benefits has yet to be determined, it gen-
erally is believed that daily practice is ideal. Future studies
should examine methods to increase practice frequency
outside of class, including reminders for practice,
engaging local practitioners for convenient booster
sessions, and exploring the delivery of yoga classes via
mobile technologies.
Although we hypothesized that the TYP would
result in better outcomes than STP and UC, it was found
that TYP was mainly better than STP, with only 1 out-
come noted to be different from UC. The differences
between STP and TYP/UC mainly were due to the
fact that the STP group did not get better over time,
as was noted with the other 2 groups. It remains unclear
why simple stretching exercises would slow down

 improvement in sleep outcomes after chemotherapy com-
pared with usual care. Chart reviews did not offer any
clues.
There are several limitations to the current study.
Recruiting patients undergoing chemotherapy was chal-
lenging, resulting in a 56% participation rate. Moreover,
approximately 22% of patients dropped out of the study
before randomization and another 20% did not provide
any follow-up data and therefore were not included in the
analyses. However, we noted that there were no systematic
differences with regard to any factors between those
patients who provided follow-up data or were lost to
follow-up, thereby diminishing concerns of a biased sam-
ple. The high rate of attrition may have resulted in the trial
being underpowered. However, it is unlikely that a larger
sample size would have changed the findings. The current
study also was a single-center study with a relatively homo-
geneous
patient
population.
The
patient-instructor
encounter time also was limited and this may have been the
main reason for the lack of benefit noted when comparing
TYP with UC. In addition, the classes were delivered in a
1-on-1 format, thereby removing the possible benefits
derived from teaching yoga in a group format in which par-
ticipants receive social support. Although the current study
was not a priori powered to detect clinically significant
group differences, the majority of group differences were
classified as medium to large effects. In addition, due to the
exclusion of the 54 patients who were not receiving treat-
ment during the trial, the current analyses were not entirely
consistent with the intent-to-treat principle. Instead, the
current study should be deemed a per-protocol analysis
based on women who were randomized and met the study
eligibility criteria. The current trial also was not conducted
in a blinded manner with regard to the group assignment.
Because there were 2 active intervention groups, partici-
pants could have been informed that we were testing 2 dif-
ferent behavioral interventions to improve aspects of
quality of life. In this way, participants would not have
known the details of each intervention group and patients
in both groups would have believed they were receiving the
active intervention. This is the model the study laboratory
and others currently are using for mind-body research.
However, at the time the current study was launched, this
innovative approach was not being used. We also did
not inquire regarding expectations of the benefits of the
interventions programs, which could have influenced
outcomes.
Even with the limitations of the current study,
it is interesting to note that there were some modest
short-term benefits associated with TYP, even though
patients attended only up to 4 in-person sessions spread
over 4 to 12 weeks. It also is encouraging to note that the
frequency of practice outside of class was associated with
improved sleep outcomes over time. The findings of the
current study suggest that it is ideal to have >4 in-person
sessions to improve patient outcomes, whereas to our
knowledge the minimum dose necessary to improve out-
comes was previously unknown. Future research using
shorter in-class instruction exposure should focus on
increasing patient engagement in the practices after leaving
the formative instructional portion of the intervention.
