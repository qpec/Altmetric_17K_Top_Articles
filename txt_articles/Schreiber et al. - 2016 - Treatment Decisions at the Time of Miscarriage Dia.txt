Abstract
Objective—To describe the factors patients and physicians prioritize during first-trimester 
miscarriage management, and assess what drives satisfaction with care.
Methods—We conducted a mixed-methods study of clinically stable women seeking surgical, 
medical, or expectant miscarriage treatment. Women with first trimester fetal demise or 
anembryonic gestation (n=55) completed demographic and psychosocial surveys. Using purposive 
sampling, 45 (82%) completed in-depth interviews. Fifteen obstetricians were interviewed. 
Participants described factors that informed their counseling (physicians) or decision-making 
(patients). Content analysis used an integrated approach with inductively and deductively derived 
codes. Patient-derived themes were stratified by treatment choice. Associations between variables 
and treatment choices were analyzed.
Results—Thirty-four women (62%) received surgical, 19 (35%) received medical and two (4%) 
received expectant management. Physicians expected that women with prior pregnancies have 
strong management preferences, and indeed, multigravid patients were less likely to change their 
initial treatment choice after counseling than primigravid patients (12% vs. 42%, odds ratio 0.18 
[95%CI 0.04, 0.81] p=0.03). Physicians favored patient-centered decisions and patients chose the 
treatment that they thought would least affect other responsibilities. Those ultimately receiving 
surgical management had a higher monthly income (adjusted OR 1.30 (1.04, 1.63) p=0.023) and 
more social support (adjusted OR 2.45 (1.07, 5.61) p=0.035) than the medical group. The surgical 
group cited loss acceptance, a favorable perception of surgery, and a desire to expedite the 
miscarriage as decisive factors. The medical group endorsed control over, and timed completion

 of, the miscarriage in a more intimate setting, an aversion to surgery or anesthesia, and a 
perception of improved fertility preservation as decisive factors. Regardless of treatment choice, 
satisfaction with treatment was linked to a supportive clinical team and expeditious resolution.
Conclusion—Prior pregnancy experiences, obligations, and socio-demographic factors influence 
miscarriage management decision-making. Structured counseling, especially for primigravid 
patients, could improve both the physician and the patient experience with miscarriage care.
INTRODUCTION
Miscarriage is the most common complication of pregnancy, affecting approximately one in 
four pregnant women [1]. Treatment options have evolved over recent years and now include 
uterine aspiration (in the office or operating room, under local anesthesia or sedation), 
medical management with prostaglandin analogues (most commonly misoprostol), or 
expectant management. Although all three treatment options are generally considered safe, 
the therapies are experientially different both clinically and logistically, and offer different 
amounts of patient participation [2]. Provider bias and training, as well as the clinical 
resources available, can determine how management options are presented to patients [3].
Patient satisfaction with treatment may be higher when women’s preferences are taken into 
account in the decision-making process [2,4]. Data on the nature of these preferences and 
evidence-based facilitators of the decision-making process are limited, and more 
representative of women residing in the UK, where the healthcare environment is different 
from the US [5-7]. Given that there are management options for women obtaining 
miscarriage care in U.S. urban tertiary care centers, this study used mixed methods to 
synthesize a better understanding of patient-level and physician-level factors that impact 
treatment choice and ultimate satisfaction, with the goal of informing improvements in 
patient–centered miscarriage care.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
We used a convergent parallel mixed methods design [8] to conduct this study from January 
2014-January 2015. In this type of design, qualitative and quantitative data are collected 
simultaneously and interpreted once the two data streams are merged. Patient participants 
were recruited from the clinical practices of the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania 
as well as the Hospital’s Emergency Department (ED) at the time of miscarriage diagnosis. 
Many initiated clinical care at EDs or outpatient practices outside of our institution and 
either self-referred or were referred to our institution for clinical care. Eligible patients could 
have had symptoms that prompted them to seek care (for example, bleeding or cramping), or 
could have had the diagnosis of a nonviable pregnancy made incidentally at the time of a 
viability ultrasound, but all patients were clinically stable enough to be offered options for 
clinical management, and none carried the diagnosis of incomplete of inevitable abortion or 
required urgent intervention. A patient was eligible to participate if she was 1) 18 and over, 
2) had an ultrasound diagnosis of an anembryonic gestation or embryonic or fetal demise in 
the first trimester (5-12 completed weeks of pregnancy) confirmed by 2 clinicians, neither of 
whom were the investigator of record, 3) willing to provide informed consent, and was 4)

 English speaking. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the 
University of Pennsylvania and all participants gave written informed consent.
At enrollment, which was after the miscarriage diagnosis had been made, but before a 
treatment plan was finalized, the patient participants completed validated questionnaires that 
included demographics, psychosocial assessments including the Center for Epidemiologic 
Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) [9], the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) [10], the 
Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) [11], the PTSD Checklist-Civilian (PCLC) [12], and the Social 
Support Interview [13] , as well as questions about pregnancy loss management preferences. 
Following survey completion, an open-ended, semi-structured interview was scheduled to be 
completed within 7 days. Interviews were conducted in-person or over the telephone by 
trained research staff from the Mixed Methods Research Lab at the University of 
Pennsylvania. We used a semi-structured interview script with standardized prompts to 
ensure consistency with content (see Appendix 1, available online at http://links.lww.com/
xxx). The script was based upon our research question, a literature review and the Integrated 
Behavioral Model [14]. It explored logistical, social, health, and personal factors that 
significantly impacted the patient’s decision when choosing treatment for early pregnancy 
loss. Duration of interviews was approximately 30 minutes. All participants received 
reimbursement for time and travel. Forty-five patient-participant interviews were necessary 
to reach thematic saturation, when no new ideas related to management choice emerged. We 
used a purposive sampling approach to achieve adequate representation from individuals 
who received active (surgical or medical) management.
Physician participants (attending obstetricians and gynecologists) were recruited from area 
academic and community practices, including sites where the patient participants were 
diagnosed or treated, in order to assess counseling practices of the range of providers. All 
managed miscarriage patients, but not all offered all three methods themselves (some 
referred out for office-based uterine aspiration, for example). Physicians participated in 
open-ended, semi-structured interviews designed to identify key considerations that 
physicians cited as important when counseling patients regarding miscarriage management. 
Interviews were conducted in-person or over the telephone by trained Mixed Methods 
Research Lab staff. A semi-structured interview script was created to ensure consistency 
with content (see Appendix 2, available online at http://links.lww.com/xxx).
Associations between maternal demographic and clinical variables and treatment outcomes 
were computed using Stata 14 (Statacorp LP). Evaluations included Kruskal-Wallis and 
Wilcoxon rank tests, and logistic regression. Multivariate analysis included variables with 
significance <0.1 in bivariate analysis. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, de-identified 
and entered into qualitative data analysis software (NVivo 10.0) for coding and analysis. We 
conducted a content analysis by developing a coding scheme using an integrated approach to 
coding . This involved establishing a set of codes based upon a line by line reading of the 
interviews. The investigator team read through five interviews to identify key ideas that were 
present in the transcripts. These ideas became grounded theory codes. Each code was 
defined and decision rules for use of each code was entered into the codebook. In addition, 
several a priori codes were established to capture key elements of our research questions 
(e.g. satisfaction with decision) [15-18]. Coding was performed by the Mixed Methods

 Research Lab. In order to ensure reliability of the coding scheme, a total of 12 transcripts 
were independently coded by two coders. The coding in those transcripts was compared 
using the inter-rater reliability function in NVivo 10.0 and inconsistences were resolved 
through discussion between the two coders in an iterative process. After each iteration, the 
coding scheme was refined. The final inter-rater reliability was 94.4%. Quantitative analysis 
and qualitative analysis were performed by different teams.
RESULTS
The quantitative characteristics of all fifty-five patient-participants were assessed. Just over 
half of participants (55%) stated that their first choice of miscarriage management was 
surgical, 18 (33%) said their first choice was medical management, and 7 (13%) participants 
initially opted for expectant management. After counseling, 34 (62%) participants made a 
final choice to receive surgical management, 19 (35%) participants received medical 
management, and 2 (4%) participants received expectant management. The patient-
population’s demographics, obstetric histories and psychosocial metrics, stratified by 
treatment received, are shown in Table 1.
In bivariate comparisons, the 34 participants receiving surgical management were 
significantly (p<0.05) more likely than the 19 receiving medical management to be educated 
beyond high school, to have a higher monthly income and were less likely to report being 
depressed. The thirteen measures of social support tested were similar between the 2 groups 
except for one (‘Generally speaking, when you may need help in doing something, or 
advice, information support, etc., do you turn to the people available to you?’ [13]) which 
was statistically significantly higher in participants receiving surgical management.
Table 2 gives the odds ratios, 95%CI and significance of these bivariate comparisons and 
shows that in the multivariate analysis, monthly income and high score on the social support 
measure showed significant association (p<0.05) with receiving surgical treatment. In the 
adjusted model, there was a 30% higher odds of surgical treatment for each $400 bracketed 
increase in salary, and 2.45-fold increase for each reported step higher in social support. The 
only factor that distinguished the 2 participants who ultimately committed to expectant 
management was higher order gravidity (G10 and G12, respectively). Multigravidae were 
less likely to change their initial treatment choice after counseling than primigravidae (12% 
vs. 42%, odds ratio 0.18 [95%CI 0.04, 0.81] p=0.03), Fifty percent of the women who 
switched treatments were primigravid, compared to 18% primigravida among women who 
did not switch treatment (p=0.03), but otherwise there were no significant socio-
demographics associated with switching treatment choice after physician counseling.
Qualitative themes from patient interviews were summarized (representative quotes of the 
dominant considerations are shown in Table 3). Though not a focus of the interview script, 
many participants described frustration with a lengthy process of obtaining a definitive 
diagnosis, or of finding a treating provider, or both, as heavily influencing their management 
choice. Once a definitive demise diagnosis was received, women described coming to terms 
with the loss, and a desire for closure. “I was ready to move on from the horrible news I’ve 
heard. I felt like once I got this news, I just wanted it out.” Overall, and regardless of

 management choice, participants emphasized a need to control or predict when and where 
they would complete their miscarriage. “The pill seemed like a better option because I had 
more control over the situation. Even though I didn't have control of what happened, it felt 
like I had some control of how I handled it.” This theme was often discussed in conjunction 
with their need to fulfill work and home responsibilities. For example, a woman who chose 
surgical management stated, “I didn’t want to be miscarrying at work. That would be 
number one. So [either] the medicine or the procedure. And then I went with the procedure 
because I didn’t want to prolong it in case everything didn’t happen the first time.” In 
addition to considering how their management choice would affect those around them, 
participants also considered how the treatment would be experienced personally. “The sight 
of blood… that’s just not something I can deal with, let alone the evidence of a baby or 
something” stated a woman who chose surgical over medical or expectant management.
Further qualitative themes were revealed by patient participants (representative quotes are 
shown in the second half of Table 3). Previously pregnant women relied on their past 
experience to inform their miscarriage management choice and many cited previous 
spontaneous and induced abortion experiences as allowing them to anticipate what surgical 
or medical management would entail. “I chose to do it at home because I already know what 
it is to get the surgery part. It was more intimate being home…being angry and sad … I did 
not want to take it out on anybody else.” A few women stated they felt uncomfortable with 
surgical management because they associated it with induced abortion, “the one that 
sounded like abortion, that wasn't a good option for me because I had one prior, and I don’t 
have good memories of that.” Others explained they were not religious or said that their 
beliefs did not play a role because the pregnancy was no longer viable. “The procedure I got 
had nothing to do with an abortion … I had to get it done. [but] I don’t believe in killing a 
‘baby’ that’s healthy and will make it.” Some women who had experienced multiple losses 
or were highly invested in childbearing explained that their choice for procedure was 
motivated by a desire for genetic testing or generally “getting answers” as a motivation for 
choosing a procedure, while others believed medical management to be more aligned with 
fecundity preservation. “So we would like to start trying again as soon as we can. So I didn't 
really want to do the natural route. I just didn't want to be waiting. I think also once I got to 
the clinic, I was like, I don't know if I feel comfortable about like doing surgery. So between 
that and talking to my mom, the medication seemed like the best route for me.”
The patient-participant population valued the physician counseling, “Once she [the doctor] 
explained each procedure and what it entailed, I knew what I wanted to do.” And patients 
often relied on their support system in conjunction with the physician recommendation, 
“[the doctor’s opinion] was a big part of my decision. And then I was reassured by my 
partner to go ahead with proceeding.”
Thematic saturation was reached after interviews with 15 physicians and their demographics 
are shown in Table 4. Physicians described their role in treatment decision-making. “There 
are many situations where [patients] turn it back on me and ask me what I would do if I were 
them and so I think that tends to be reflective of the importance of my role.” Physicians were 
sensitive to the complexity of the decision, and that the full counseling requires 
acknowledgement of how women balance their preferences, their responsibilities, as well as 
Schreiber et al.

 system limitations, “patients, once they get a diagnosis like this, want to end the pregnancy 
and move on with their grieving as quickly and efficiently as possible …. The procedures 
that require them to wait for pre-op testing and then get a spot in the day unit to get their 
termination done are often less preferred than something that can be done quickly … I think 
it has mostly to do with how fast they can get it done, how discretely they can get it done 
and how quickly they can get back to their lives afterwards… For me as a consultant it 
would be easier if I had more physicians who did manual aspirations in the office.”
Physician-participants appreciated that patients diagnosed with miscarriage have a range of 
expectations about their pregnancy, and that this can influence how a patient makes a 
management decision: “their knowledge about miscarriage in general affects it [their 
decision]… I think that if [the miscarriage diagnosis] came as a shock… they aren’t able to 
make a decision and then come back deciding they want a rapid cure.” Physician 
participants described that patients have different relationships with their pregnancies, and 
that this influences how they respond to the news of the miscarriage which may modify the 
counseling process. “They need to feel that the provider isn't judgmental, because sometimes 
– like for instance, if the patient didn't want to be pregnant in the first place, and now they're 
there with a miscarriage, sometimes they're relieved.” Some reported that they are able to 
assess the patient’s tolerance for pain and bleeding while discussing treatment choices. As 
these preferences become clear, the best management choice emerges. “…the way I phrase it 
is if you're willing to go through the process of the miscarriage at home …without rushing to 
the emergency room as soon as you start bleeding, then I say that's what you should do.”
Ten (18%) of the 55 participants received a treatment strategy that was different from what 
they stated they intended to do before they had completed the clinical counseling process 
(Table 5). These participants often described being influenced by their provider, in some 
cases, their family and friends, as well as the failure of expectant management to provide 
timely resolution. Six women switched from expectant to surgical management, one woman 
switched from expectant to medical management, two women switched from surgical to 
medical management, and one woman switched from medical to surgical management. 
Women who switched their management choice from expectant management to surgical 
management often did so in reaction to their dissatisfaction with the length of time required 
to receive a definitive pregnancy loss diagnosis: “At that time it had already been two weeks, 
and I just didn’t feel like waiting anymore. So then I went ahead and we scheduled the 
procedure.” Women also switched to surgical management because they became concerned 
about the risk of incomplete abortion with medical or expectant management: “…when she 
said that sometimes [medical management] doesn’t work the first time, that it was necessary 
to use it again or still end of having a D&E, I was already sad enough that I really didn’t 
want it to drag out.”
Regardless of treatment choice, patient satisfaction was linked with the presence of 
supportive and compassionate staff, having sufficient information regarding miscarriage 
procedures and confidence in the quality of their care: “Absolutely, they addressed every 
question, concern we had. And I felt like they gave the best care that they possibly could.” 
Most women described relief that the miscarriage was complete: “I honestly emotionally felt 
better the next day. It was just like now we can move on. It's over, as opposed to thinking

 about how I thought I was pregnant for three weeks and I wasn't anymore.” Those women 
who received medical management reported the process was better than anticipated: “It was 
fine. Actually I was described that it could be a lot worse, like a lot of bleeding. I had pain, 
but I mean, it was bearable. It was fine. So yes, it was okay. It was okay. I was expecting 
something worse actually.” Those women who were thoroughly informed by their doctor on 
what to anticipate while using the medication felt more comfortable with the process: “They 
let me know exactly what to do beforehand, and so that made everything easier. Keeping up 
with the – knowing what to do with the medication… That's what we did, they let me know I 
could lay down, get a movie, get a favorite food, et cetera.”
DISCUSSION
In this mixed-methods study of women seeking management for a current, clinically stable, 
first trimester miscarriage, we found that the choice of management strategy was influenced 
by the woman’s socio-economic status, the opinion of those the she trusts (including her 
physician), her experience with the current pregnancy, her past pregnancy experiences (or 
lack thereof), and the time investment required for treatment. Physicians from a variety of 
practice settings had independent insight into the majority of these considerations. In our 
population, women who had had prior personal experience with any pregnancy, and more 
specifically an interrupted pregnancy (spontaneous or induced abortion) were able to use this 
knowledge-base to inform their management preferences for the current pregnancy, while 
women without prior pregnancy experiences were less likely to bring strong opinions to the 
clinical encounter and looked to their physician team for directive counseling. Prior 
literature has suggested that specialized attention from medical providers can be therapeutic 
to women and couples experiencing pregnancy loss [19, 20]. Our results suggested 
specifically that women new to pregnancy rely more heavily on their clinician for guidance, 
and that they might benefit most substantively from care from providers with expertise in 
miscarriage management experiences and outcomes.
Women reported the importance of having control and self-determination in concluding their 
miscarriage in a timely manner. In our sample, many women of higher socio-economic 
status chose surgical management, and cited the need to return to work and family 
obligations as a primary rationale. While both patients and obstetricians value the flexibility 
and less invasive qualities of medical management, concerns about the probability of 
incomplete abortion, as high as 15-37% [2] limited its utilization by many. An improved 
medication regimen for embryonic and fetal demise, or a clinical prediction rule for success, 
is warranted so that women have the option for this management strategy without sacrificing 
timely completion of the abortion.
Our data uncovered that satisfaction with management is driven by the experience with the 
care received, rather than one specific therapeutic option over another. Satisfaction was 
mainly driven by efficiency of care, confidence in quality of care, sensitive providers, and 
effective two-way communication. Both the physician and patient-level data show alignment 
in considering the individual needs of the patient as well as her external demands when 
choosing a treatment course. Prior studies have suggested that provider treatment 
preferences influence treatment recommendations [3], but our mixed method data show that

 physicians hoped to facilitate the patient making her own management decision. Physicians 
grappled with the counseling the process, stating simultaneously that the management 
choice should be patient-driven, but that their medical knowledge and experience was of 
value. Our patient-level data also show (and support what others have suggested [4]) that not 
all women feel equipped to make the management decision. The data highlight that a critical 
gap exists in how to structure patient-centered miscarriage management counseling. 
Primigravidity could be an alert that a patient may require more in-depth guidance on 
miscarriage management decision making. A decision tool to aid in patient counseling and 
shared-decision making, could be of benefit.
Our study has limitations. All patient participants were recruited from a single clinical 
research site and all participants were English speaking to maximize integrity of the 
linguistic subtleties during data interpretation, so our results may not be generalizable. 
However, many women were referred from other practices and hospitals in the region, so the 
range of their clinical care experience was representative of many different practice patterns. 
Similarly, while the physicians we interviewed were all obstetricians and gynecologists, so 
may not be representative of all pregnancy-care providers [3], they came from a range of 
practice sites, clinical expertise, races and both sexes. While our sample size was small, the 
distribution of our population was diverse, and our use of purposive sampling allowed us to 
describe a wide range of experiences, and attaining thematic saturation enabled us to distill 
the range of ideas in the population. Given that we found class differences in miscarriage 
experience and management choice, regional differences may also occur. Future research to 
validate our findings nationally would be useful.
Our study populations’ narratives make clear that women do not make a miscarriage 
management decision in a vacuum, but instead their management preferences are highly 
influenced by the woman’s a priori experience with the diagnostic and treatment process of 
the miscarriage (length of time, quality of their interactions with the clinical team) in 
addition to her personal pregnancy history and social pressures. Meanwhile, physicians 
grapple with systems limitations to delivering timely, patient-centered care. The ready 
availability of highly sensitive urine pregnancy tests and early pregnancy recognition has 
revealed the high prevalence of pregnancy loss and recent data show that misconceptions 
and feelings of isolation are all too common [19]. Pregnancy loss has been traditionally been 
considered inevitable and untreatable by mainstream medicine, and support services 
therefore emerged as an adjunctive, not integrated, social movement [21]. Given the 
incidence and prevalence of this diagnosis, one million times annually in the United States 
[22, 23], it is time to ameliorate our approach to miscarriage care. This study highlights 
some of the systems, therapeutic, and counseling gaps that can be addressed in clinical care 
and advanced by future research.

2Monthly income was measured in brackets of $400 per month, with a base bracket of $0.
3Social support was measured on a 5-point Likert scale (1:Never, 2:Rarely, 3:Sometimes, 4:Usually, 5:Always) and was found to be linearly related 
to the probability of surgical treatment.

Major patient consideration themes regarding miscarriage management
Theme
Medical
Surgical
Acceptance of
Pregnancy Loss
I really, honestly, I didn’t want to
wait it out, like I said, because I
already didn’t know how long … the
fetus didn’t have a heartbeat inside
me and I really didn’t want to wait
just for that reason.
I was ready to move on from the
horrible news I’ve heard. I felt like
once I got this news, I just wanted it
out.
Timing &
Control of
Miscarriage
Process
So when she gave me the pills she
said I can either take them today or
tomorrow…And as long as it gets
done, that’s the only thing I care
about.
I didn’t want to be miscarrying at
work. That would be number one. So
[either] the medicine or the
procedure. And then I went with the
procedure because I didn’t want to
prolong it in case everything didn’t
happen the first time.
Home & Work
Responsibilities
So I’d rather be in the comfort of my
own home with a bed, TV or
whatever the case is, so I can be
comfortable.
I’m a manager of about 150 people
and I make decisions for them every
day that I go to work. So it’s hard for
me to follow behind somebody else’s
ideas, decision, choice, opinion. And I
have three children: one that’s in
college and two small children – ten
and five. And that’s just not something
that I wanted to happen at home,
especially at work.
Pain &
Physical
Aversions
Yeah, natural passing was just taking
too long. I couldn’t bear the pain of
with the D&C, so I just figured the
pill was my last option.
I faint at the sight of blood… that’s
just not something I can deal with, let
alone the evidence of a baby or
something.
Prior
pregnancy
experience:
I chose to do it at home because I
already know what it is to get the
surgery. It was more intimate being
home. I know … the first time I
miscarried being angry and you're
sad … I did not want to take it out on
anybody else.
Since I’d had abortions in the past I
knew what it was like. It’s just about
whether or not they were going to
scrape it out, or use a vacuum … other
than that, I knew that was going to
happen.
Understanding
of Management
Choices
The option to let it pass on its own…I
wouldn't know exactly when …and I
wanted it to be the right time and
place. I don't want it just to happen
anywhere. So that wasn't good for
me. So then the one that sounded like
abortion, that wasn't a good option
for me because I had one prior, and I
don’t have good memories of that.
And the pill seemed like a better
option because I had more control
over the situation. Even though I
didn't have control of what happened,
it felt like I had some control of how I
handled it.
…she offered me to either let it pass
through or to take a vaginal medicine
to have it pass through. Either – but
both of those options I felt like I
would’ve had to come back to the
hospital to make sure everything was
fully out, so I figured that by me
getting it aspirated right here that
everything will be out and I wouldn’t
have to come back to go through the
trauma again.
Health and
Safety
I chose it because I didn’t want the
scaring [from surgery]
But I know from what my mother-in-
law said, if I was carrying a dead
baby, that toxins would be going
through my body. That’s why I
decided, to get the D&C.
Opinions of
Physician,
Family, and
Friends
It was a very personal decision to
take the medication. I was afraid of
the other option. Actually I called
[my doctor who] … was an
important part of the decision.
My first thought was to get this over
with as quickly as possible. And so I
was leaning towards the surgical
route a little bit. My mom, a nurse,
helped advise me too. So that was
instrumental in picking the decision I
did.

Major physician consideration themes regarding miscarriage management
Theme
Representative quote
Opinions of
Physician,
Family, and
Friends
You know, it's my responsibility to give them an even
picture where I'm trying not to seemingly support one
over another. If for a particular patient I do, I’ll tell them that,
you know what? I like this one. And then I’ll them
why I like that one, and not the other options. And I’ll tell
them why I don’t like the other options, and [then] they
have some sense of what my thought process is.
Pain &
Physical
Aversions
I phrase it… if you are willing to go through the process
of the miscarriage at home […] then I say that’s what you
should do. But I tell them if they’re the type of person
that’s going…rush to the emergency room; they’re going
to end up with a D&E anyway.
Timing &
Control of
Miscarriage
Process
It would be easier if I had more physicians who did
manual aspirations in the office. There’s really only one
person who does that and as a result a lot of these
patients … then have some limits in the options available
to them.
Prior
Pregnancy
Experience
I think with the ones who’ve had it before … they’ve sort
of already made up their mind … if they had a decent
experience with the certain option they’ll go for that or if
they didn’t, they’ll go for something else…
Understanding
of
Management
Choices
I generally give detailed information about the risks,
benefits and alternatives including the percentage of
success and the likelihood of further complications and I
help them make a decision that’s right for them.
