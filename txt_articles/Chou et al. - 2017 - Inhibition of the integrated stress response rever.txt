Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of long-term neuro-
logical disability, yet the mechanisms underlying the chronic cogni-
tive deficits associated with TBI remain unknown. Consequently,
there are no effective treatments for patients suffering from the
long-lasting symptoms of TBI. Here, we show that TBI persistently
activates the integrated stress response (ISR), a universal intracellular
signaling pathway that responds to a variety of cellular conditions
and regulates protein translation via phosphorylation of the trans-
lation initiation factor eIF2α. Treatment with ISRIB, a potent drug-like
small-molecule inhibitor of the ISR, reversed the hippocampal-
dependent cognitive deficits induced by TBI in two different injury
mouse models—focal contusion and diffuse concussive injury. Sur-
prisingly, ISRIB corrected TBI-induced memory deficits when admin-
istered weeks after the initial injury and maintained cognitive
improvement after treatment was terminated. At the physiological
level, TBI suppressed long-term potentiation in the hippocampus,
which was fully restored with ISRIB treatment. Our results indicate
that ISR inhibition at time points late after injury can reverse memory
deficits associated with TBI. As such, pharmacological inhibition of
the ISR emerges as a promising avenue to combat head trauma-
induced chronic cognitive deficits.

T
raumatic brain injury (TBI) represents a major mental health
problem (1–4). Even a mild TBI can elicit cognitive deficits,
including permanent memory dysfunction (2, 4). Moreover, TBI
is one of the most predictive environmental risk factors for the
development of Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of de-
mentia (5–9). Current treatments have focused primarily on
reducing the risk of TBI incidence, immediate neurosurgical
intervention, or broad behavioral rehabilitation (10–13). Despite
posing a huge societal problem, there are currently no pharma-
cological treatment options for patients that suffer from TBI-
induced cognitive deficits.
The integrated stress response (ISR) is an evolutionarily con-
served pathway that controls cellular homeostasis and function
(14). The central ISR regulatory step is the phosphorylation of the
α-subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2α) by
a family of four eIF2α kinases (15, 16). Phosphorylation of eIF2α
leads to inhibition of general protein synthesis, but also, to the
translational up-regulation of a select subset of mRNAs (17, 18). In
the brain, phosphorylation of eIF2α regulates the formation of
long-term memory (19–21). Briefly, animals with reduced phos-
phorylation of eIF2α show enhanced long-term memory storage
(19, 22–24), and increased phosphorylation of eIF2α in the brain
prevents the formation of long-term memory (19, 24, 25).
Similar to other chronic cognitive disorders (21, 26), TBI leads
to a persistent activation of the ISR. TBI induces eIF2α phos-
phorylation even in brain regions that are distal to the injury site
(27, 28). However, the direct impact of ISR activation on chronic
TBI-induced behavioral deficits remains unknown.
We recently discovered a potent (in-cell EC50 = 5 nM) drug-like
small molecule ISRIB (ISR inhibitor) that reverses the translational
effects induced by ISR-mediated eIF2α phosphorylation and readily
permeates the blood–brain barrier (29). ISRIB binds to eIF2’s gua-
nine nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B and induces its dimerization
(30, 31). ISRIB-induced dimerization increases eIF2B-mediated
guanine nucleotide exchange and desensitizes eIF2B activity to in-
hibition by phosphorylated eIF2α (p-eIF2α). As such, it blunts the
effects of eIF2α phosphorylation on translation initiation. Strong
parallels between in vivo genetic and pharmacological experiments
support the notion that ISRIB exerts all its effect on target by
inhibiting the ISR induced by eIF2α phosphorylation (19, 32, 33).
We hypothesized that TBI-induced sustained eIF2α phosphor-
ylation in the hippocampus, a brain region crucially involved in
memory formation, could be a major contributor to the permanent
cognitive dysfunction observed after TBI (34). To test this notion,
we investigated whether treatment with ISRIB, several weeks
postinjury, could remedy TBI-induced impairments in cognitive
function and associated changes in synaptic function.

Significance
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of long-term neu-
rological disability and affects an ever-growing population. Cur-
rently, there are no effective treatments for patients suffering
from chronic TBI-induced cognitive impairments. Here, we found
that suppression of the integrated stress response (ISR) with a
drug-like small-molecule inhibitor, ISRIB, rescued cognition in two
TBI mouse models, even when administered weeks after injury.
Consistent with the behavioral results, ISRIB restored long-term
potentiation deficits observed in TBI mice. Our data suggest that
targeting ISR activation could serve as a promising approach for
the treatment of chronic cognitive dysfunction after TBI.

 controlled cortical impact in mice (34). This mouse model of TBI
exhibits cognitive deficits similar to those commonly observed after
contusion injuries in humans (35). Briefly, we surgically exposed the
brain and induced a controlled impact injury with a pneumatic
piston on the right parietal cortex above the hippocampus. Sham
controls received the same surgery but without a TBI. We collected
and processed the hippocampus ipsilateral to the injury to quantify
p-eIF2α levels at 1 and 28 d postinjury (dpi) (Fig. 1A). The phos-
phorylation of eIF2α was significantly increased in the hippocampus
of animals with TBI at 1 dpi (Fig. 1 B and C). Compared with sham
controls, in mice with TBI, hippocampal p-eIF2α remained ele-
vated even 28 d after injury (Fig. 1 D and E), indicating that TBI
triggers a persistent activation of the ISR in the hippocampus.
ISRIB Rescues TBI-Induced Deficits in Spatial Learning and Memory
Consolidation. Next, we investigated whether blockage of the TBI-
induced ISR could reverse the learning and memory deficits in
mice with TBI. To this end, we induced focal TBI (as described in
Materials and Methods) and allowed animals to recover for 4 wk.
We then evaluated hippocampal-dependent long-term memory
storage using a radial arm water maze (RAWM) (34). In this
forced-swim behavioral test, animals learned to locate a hidden
platform in one of the eight arms using navigational cues set in the
room (Fig. 2A). Analysis tracking software was used to determine
the number of incorrect arm entries (termed an “error”). The total
number of errors before the animal finds the escape platform is
used as a metric of learning and memory.
As expected, sham animals learned the location of the escape
platform after multiple training blocks (Fig. 2B, 28–29 dpi, black
solid circles). When memory was measured at 1 d and 7 d after
training (Fig. 2B, 30 and 37 dpi), sham animals averaged less than
one error before locating the escape platform. By contrast, learning
was dramatically impaired in mice with TBI, even after multiple
training blocks (Fig. 2B, 28 dpi, red circles; TBI mice averaged
more than three errors). Consequently, when memory was tested
on day 30 and day 37, injured mice made significantly more errors
compared with sham animals (Fig. 2 A and B, red solid circles).
Thus, these data indicate that TBI impairs learning and memory.
To test whether pharmacological blockage of the ISR restores the
lasting learning and memory deficits resulting from TBI, we injected
the animals with ISRIB (at 2.5 mg/kg or vehicle) intraperitoneally
(i.p.) into both sham and TBI animals. ISRIB treatment started at
27 dpi, the day before the first behavioral training (Fig. 2B, 27 dpi),
and continued with daily injections throughout the duration of the
training (three injections in total, Materials and Methods). Strikingly,
during training ISRIB-treated injured animals (Fig. 2B, 28–29 dpi,
red open circles, dotted line) performed better than vehicle-treated
TBI animals (Fig. 2B, 28–29 dpi, red solid circles). More impor-
tantly, memory tested both 1 d (30 dpi) and 7 d (37 dpi) after
training was dramatically improved in brain-injured mice treated
with ISRB. As ISRIB was given only during training, the data
demonstrate that the effect of ISRIB on memory lasts beyond the
period of treatment.
ISRIB Reverses TBI-Induced Deficits in Hippocampal Long-Term
Potentiation. Sustained changes in synaptic efficacy that result
from repeated neuronal activity are believed to constitute the cel-
lular basis of learning and memory (36). The best-characterized
form of synaptic plasticity in the mammalian brain is long-term
potentiation (LTP), which is manifested as long-lasting increases
in synaptic strength. Consistent with the deficits in hippocampal
long-term memory, TBI has been previously reported to inhibit
hippocampal LTP (37). To examine whether LTP was altered in
our focal TBI model, we induced TBI as above, allowed the animals
to recover for 4 wk, and measured hippocampal LTP in hippo-
campal brain slices at Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses. We ob-
served that LTP was significantly impaired in hippocampal slices
from TBI mice compared with those of sham animals (Fig. 3 A and
B). Treatment with ISRIB reversed the deficient LTP in slices from
TBI mice (Fig. 3 A and B). It is noteworthy that ISRIB had no
effect on LTP in sham animals (Fig. 3 A and B), and did not sig-
nificantly change basal synaptic transmission in TBI mice (Fig. S1).
Thus, ISRIB specifically restores LTP in mice with an injured brain.
Taken together, these data show that ISRIB restored both hippo-
campal long-term memory and associated changes in synaptic
function in TBI mice.
ISRIB Restores TBI-Induced Deficits in Working and Episodic Learning
and Memory in a Concussive Injury Model. To assess the robustness
of our results, we next asked whether ISRIB might also be ef-
fective in another TBI model. We used a close head injury model
(38–40), which mimics diffuse concussive injury commonly ob-
served in human patients (35). Like the focal TBI model, con-
cussive injury resulted in a chronic activation of the ISR in the
hippocampus, as determined by increased phosphorylation of
eIF2α at 26 dpi (Fig. S2). We evaluated cognitive function using
a delayed-matching-to-place paradigm (DMP) (41), a more chal-
lenging hippocampal-dependent behavioral task than RAWM. In

 DMP, deficits in both working and episodic-like learning and
memory are assessed, while eliminating the potential stress-based
caveats introduced by water exposure and forced swimming be-
havior, typically associated with RAWM. Animals on the DMP
learn to locate an escape tunnel attached to one of 40 holes in a
circular table using visual cues to evade loud noise in a brightly lit
room (Fig. 4A). Importantly, the escape location was changed every
day, forcing the animal to relearn the location of the tunnel. To
quantify performance, analysis tracking software measured “escape
latency,” or the time taken by the mouse to enter the escape tunnel.
Both sham and concussive-injured animals were treated with
ISRIB 1 d prior to behavior testing (14 dpi) and after the last trials
of each testing day (Fig. 4B, 15–17 dpi). Compared with sham,
concussive-injured animals failed to learn the task and took sig-
nificantly longer to reach the escape tunnel (Fig. 4B, TBI, vehicle:
red solid circles; sham, vehicle: black solid circles), a clear in-
dication that their spatial memory is impaired. By contrast, ISRIB
treatment ameliorated the concussive-injured animals’ perfor-
mance by the 3rd and 4th day of testing (Fig. 4B, 17 and 18 dpi;
TBI, ISRIB: red open circles, dotted line). Specifically, compared
with vehicle-treated injured animals, ISRIB-treated concussive-
injured animals, found the escape location faster, on the 3rd and
final day of the DMP (Fig. 4 C and D, 17 and 18 dpi). Thus, ISRIB
effectively reversed cognitive deficits induced by a different TBI
model and on an additional behavioral task.
Discussion
Our results demonstrate that pharmacological inhibition of the
ISR with ISRIB can effectively reverse TBI-induced cognitive
deficits in both focal and concussive rodent models. In both in-
jury models, eIF2α phosphorylation was persistently increased,
and hippocampus-dependent spatial learning and memory were
severely impaired. Remarkably, ISRIB treatment was sufficient
to reverse the cognitive deficits in these TBI models. Likewise,
LTP was restored in brain slices isolated from brain injured mice
when treated with ISRIB. Since the long-term deficits induced by
rodent focal contusion injury last for more than a month (as shown
here)—and even a year in a corresponding rat model (42)—these
results suggest that pharmacological attenuation of the ISR can
alleviate TBI-induced dementia and associated changes in synaptic
function long after injury.
Unlike previous studies, our work focused on reversal of
chronic deficits that develop after TBI. Previous work has been
limited to acute injury responses immediately following injury
where a robust inflammatory response characterized by immune-
cell infiltration into the brain (34, 43–47), cytokine production
(39, 40, 48–50), and reactive oxygen species release (51–53) lead
to neuronal death. Thus, strategies to counteract acute injury-
mediated effects have aimed to dampen the inflammatory re-
sponse (43, 44, 52, 54, 55). We and others have shown that
blocking the acute inflammatory responses within 24 h after in-
jury prevented the development of TBI-induced cognitive defi-
cits (34, 39, 40, 45, 50, 56, 57). However, attempts to translate the
insights gleaned from acute TBI models have failed in preclinical
studies. In addition, the development of potential treatments
that can be effective only within an acute time window after
injury poses limitations because their optimal treatment timing
may not be feasible in many clinical settings.
In the present study, we demonstrate that treatment with ISRIB
at late time points (2 and 4 wk, respectively) rapidly reverses long-
term TBI-induced cognitive deficits. Our findings rely on the study
of two injury models and combine molecular biology, pharmacology,
electrophysiology, and behavioral studies to demonstrate that acti-
vation of the ISR is responsible, at least in part, for the memory
deficits associated with TBI. As such, our results offer hope that
chronic cognitive defects resulting from TBI may be treatable.

ISRIB treatment rescues TBI-induced behavioral deficits on the radial arm
water maze 28 d after focal TBI. (A) Representative track plots showing explor-
atory activity on the RAWM. Although all animals initially made multiple errors
while locating the escape platform (block 1, Left), sham and ISRIB-treated TBI
animals learned the escape platform location and therefore made fewer errors
during the memory test 7 d after training (block 12, 37 dpi). Vehicle-treated TBI
animals made more errors than animals in the other three experiment groups
(Right). (B) Animals were i.p. injected (either vehicle or ISRIB) (2.5 mg/kg) the night
prior to starting behavior (27 dpi) and after the last trials each day during training
(28 and 29 dpi; n = 8 per sham group, n = 16 per TBI group). Animals ran 15 trials
on each training day with the performance of every 3 trials averaged as a single
block. Compared with vehicle-treated group (red solid circle, solid line), ISRIB-
treated animals (red open circle, dotted line) made significantly less errors over
the course of training and when memory was tested 24 hr (30 dpi) and 7 d (37 dpi)
after training. Data are means ± SEM (Bonferroni post hoc test, TBI + vehicle vs.

 inhibits the activity of eIF2’s guanine nucleotide exchange factor
eIF2B, and ISRIB counteracts this effect by activating eIF2B
through dimerization, which renders it less sensitive to inhibition by
p-eIF2. The consequences of ISR activation are a general down-
regulation of translation of most cellular mRNAs that utilize
eIF2 to initiate ribosomes at AUG start codons. In addition, pro-
teins encoded by a small subset of mRNAs that contain strategically
placed small open reading frames in their 5′-UTRs become selec-
tively up-regulated when the ISR is activated. ISR-up-regulated
proteins include the broadly expressed transcription factor ATF4,
a memory repressor gene (58, 59), and the neuronally expressed
Rho GAP OPHN1 (33, 60). We have previously shown that eIF2α
phosphorylation-mediated increase in OPHN1 leads to AMPA
receptor down-regulation and mGluR-induced long-term de-
pression (LTD) in the hippocampus and ventral tegmental area
(VTA) (33, 61). We have also found that reduced phosphorylation
of eIF2α (or treatment with ISRIB) blocks mGluR-LTD but en-
hances cocaine-induced LTP in the VTA (61, 62). Whereas it
remains unknown whether the principles described for the VTA
also apply to the hippocampus, we speculate that ISRIB en-
hances cognitive abilities by blocking LTD and consequently
enhancing LTP, thus keeping synaptic connections stronger.
Indeed, reduction of eIF2α phosphorylation enhances hippo-
campal LTP (19, 22), but blocks mGluR-LTD (33). By contrast,
induction of eIF2α phosphorylation in hippocampal neurons
impairs LTP (19, 25) and induces mGluR-LTD (33). Thus, our
finding that ISRIB treatment rescued long-term TBI-induced
deficits in hippocampal LTP is entirely consistent with these
studies linking the ISR to LTP.
Most surprisingly, we found that systemic treatment with
ISRIB weeks after injury allowed mice to form stable spatial
memories that lasted for at least a week even after ISRIB
treatment was stopped. ISRIB’s bioavailability has a half-life of
approximately 8 hr in mouse plasma and in the brain. It equili-
brates readily between plasma and the brain and therefore it is
entirely cleared from the system within a week (29). Thus, it is
highly unlikely that ISRIB is directly influencing memory recall
(e.g., Fig. 2, at 37 dpi), but rather that ISRIB has produced
enduring changes to memory processes during the treatment
period, such as dendritic spine remodeling. Previous work has
established that TBI acutely induces significant dendritic spine
degeneration (63), and dendritic spine loss persists even a year
after a severe TBI (64). In addition, pharmacological induction
of eIF2α phosphorylation in chicks blocks training-induced increase
in the number of spines in an auditory brain area (24). Given the
close association between eIF2α phosphorylation, LTP, and spine
formation, the observed lasting effects of ISRIB treatment on
memory may point to changes in structural plasticity during learning
that persist even in the absence of the ISRIB (65–67).
It remains unclear whether ISRIB is enhancing learning and
memory through direct impact on neurons or if the potential
therapeutic effects act on other cell types such as microglia,
astrocytes, and/or immune cells. Since activation of the ISR and
eIF2α phosphorylation causes inflammatory cytokine production
(68, 69), and ISRIB interferes with downstream effects of eIF2α, it
is possible that ISRIB may be reversing TBI-initiated residual low-
grade inflammation that remains after acute inflammation has
subsided (34). We have previously shown that pharmacological or
genetic blockade of peripherally derived bone marrow macrophage
infiltration to the brain ameliorates TBI-induced cognitive loss by
preventing inflammatory cytokine production and reactive oxygen
species release (34, 53). Whether ISRIB can influence immune cell-
mediated cytokine production after TBI is not known. Whereas our
previous reports have shown that peripheral macrophage in-
filtration occurs only acutely after injury, we have observed low-
level chronic inflammation after TBI (34). Hence, it is entirely
plausible that ISRIB may impact immune function to alleviate
cognitive decline.
The surprising results presented here have yet to be extended from
mouse models to human physiology. It also remains unclear whether
ISRIB treatment cures the cognitive defects permanently or whether
lingering pathologies necessitate the ISRIB treatment to be repeated
for each new learning task. Chronic activation of the ISR and/or
neuroinflammation are associated with numerous neurodegenerative
disease states (reviewed in ref. 70). Therefore, increased un-
derstanding of these pathways characterized in TBI may have broader
therapeutic potential, especially when the window for treating acute
injuries has passed. These gaps in our knowledge notwithstanding, we
are hopeful that our findings may open promising therapeutic ave-
nues for patients that are suffering from cognitive deficits associated
with TBI and other neurodegenerative disorders.

 ∼12 wk of age. Mice were group housed in environmentally controlled
conditions with reverse light cycle (12:12 h light:dark cycle at 21 ± 1 °C) and
provided food and water ad libitum.
Surgical Procedure. All animals were randomly assigned to TBI or sham sur-
geries. Animals were anesthetized and maintained at 2% isoflurane and
secured to a stereotaxic frame with nontraumatic ear bars. The hair on their
scalp was removed, and eye ointment and betadine were applied to their eyes
and scalp, respectively. A midline incision was made to expose the skull.
Focal TBI: Controlled Cortical Impact. A unilateral TBI was induced in the right
parietal lobe using the controlled cortical impact model (34). Mice received a
∼3.5-mm diameter craniectomy, a removal of part of the skull, using
an electric microdrill. The coordinates of the craniectomy were: anteroposterior,
−2.00 mm and mediolateral, +2.00 mm with respect to bregma. Any animal that
experienced excessive bleeding due to disruption of the dura was removed from
the study. After the craniectomy, the contusion was induced using a 3-mm convex
tip attached to an electromagnetic impactor (Leica). The contusion depth was set
to 0.95 mm from dura with a velocity of 4.0 m/s sustained for 300 ms. These injury
parameters were chosen to target, but not penetrate, the hippocampus. Sham
animals received craniectomy surgeries but without the focal injury.
Concussive TBI: Closed Head Injury. TBI was induced along the midline of the
parietal lobe using the closed head injury model (38). The head of the animal
was supported with foam before injury. Contusion was induced using a
5-mm convex tip attached to an electromagnetic impactor (Leica) at the
following coordinates: anteroposterior, −1.50 mm and mediolateral, 0 mm
with respect to bregma. The contusion was produced with an impact depth
of 1 mm from the surface of the skull with a velocity of 5.0 m/s sustained for
300 ms. Any animals that had a fractured skull after injury were excluded
from the study. Sham animals received the midline skin incision but
no impact.
After focal or concussive TBI surgery, the scalp was sutured and the animal
was allowed to recover in an incubation chamber set to 37 °C. Animals were
returned to their home cage after showing normal walking and grooming
behavior. All animals fully recovered from the surgical procedures as exhibited
by normal behavior and weight maintenance monitored throughout the du-
ration of the experiments.
Drug Administration. ISRIB solution was made by dissolving 5 mg ISRIB in 1 mL
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (Fisher Scientific, D128-500) and 1 mL poly-
ethylene glycol 400 (PEG400) (EMD Millipore, PX1286B-2). The solution was
gently heated in a 40 °C waterbath and vortexed every 30 s until the solution
became clear. The solution was kept in a warm environment throughout the
experiment. Each solution was used for injections up to 4 d maximum. If the
solution became visibly cloudy or precipitated, a new solution was prepared.
ISRIB was delivered at 2.5 mg/kg dosage through i.p. injections. The vehicle
solution consisted of 1 mL DMSO and 1 mL PEG400.
Western Blotting. Hippocampi ipsilateral to the TBI in focal injury model
animals were removed at 1 or 28 d postsurgery, whereas the right hippocampi
from concussive injury model animals were removed at 26 dpi. Samples were
processed for protein quantification using homogenization buffer consisting
of RIPA lysis and extraction buffer (Fisher Scientific, 89900), PhosSTOP (Roche,
04906845001), and cOmplete ULTRA tablets (Roche, 05892970001). The nu-
clear and high molecular weight membrane fraction was removed and the
remaining cytoplasmic and membrane fraction was quantified through use
of a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit; Fisher
Scientific, 23227).
Total protein (50 μg) per lane was loaded onto a 5–15% SDS-polyacrylamide
gel (Bio-Rad, 567–1084) for electrophoresis. Proteins were then transferred
from gel onto a nitrocellulose membrane for immunodetection. Membranes
were blocked for 1 h in 5% nonfat dry milk (NFDM) (Bio-Rad, 170–6404) in PBS
with Tween20 (PBS-T) (0.1% Tween20). Antibodies specific for eIF2α (Cell Sig-
naling, 9722; 1:1,000), p-eIF2α (Cell Signaling, 9721; 1:1,000), and GADPH (Sigma,
G8795; 1:10,000) were incubated overnight at 4 °C in 5% NFDM in PBS-T. After
washes in PBS-T, the membrane was incubated at room temperature for 1 h in
appropriate secondary antibodies (Li-Cor) diluted in 1% NFDM in PBST-T.
Membranes were scanned using a Li-Cor Odyssey near-infrared imager. Raw

ISRIB treatment rescues TBI-induced behavioral deficits on the
delayed-matching-to-place paradigm 14 d after concussive injury. (A) Rep-
resentative tracks of trials on the modified Barnes maze of the DMP assay.
During trial 1 of each day, animals did not know the escape tunnel location
and did not find it quickly (trial 1, Left). By trial 4, the animals had learned
the location of the escape tunnel and took significantly less time on the trial.
ISRIB-treated TBI mice showed similar performance as both sham groups on
day 4, whereas vehicle-treated TBI mice took longer to escape (Right). (B)
Animals were injected the night before the first day of behavior (14 dpi) and
after the last trial of each day (15–17 dpi; n = 11–12 per group). Animals that
received sham surgeries were able to learn the location of the escape tunnel
over the course of each day (vehicle: black solid circle, solid line; ISRIB
treated: black open circle, dotted line). TBI animals given vehicle injections
(red solid circle, solid line) took longer to find the escape tunnel, whereas TBI
animals given ISRIB (red open circle, dotted line) did significantly better than
their vehicle-treated counterparts. Data are means ± SEM (Bonferroni post
hoc test; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001). (C) Individual animal perfor-
mances averaged across trials 2, 3, and 4 on day 3 of the DMP (17 dpi). TBI
animals treated with ISRIB were significantly faster at locating the escape
location than their vehicle-treated, TBI counterparts. Data are means ± SEM
(Bonferroni post hoc test; **P < 0.01). (D) Individual animal performances
averaged across trials 2, 3, and 4 on day 4 of the DMP (18 dpi). ISRIB-treated
TBI animals were significantly faster in locating the escape tunnel than the
vehicle-treated TBI group. Data are means ± SEM (Bonferroni post hoc test;
**P < 0.01).

 intensity for each band was measured using Li-Cor Odyssey image analysis
software. Target protein intensities were normalized to corresponding GADPH
loading control intensities to account for amount of protein per well.
Behavioral Assays. For all behavioral assays the experimenters were blinded
both to the injury regimen and therapeutic intervention. Behavioral tests
were recorded and scored using a video tracking and analysis setup (Etho-
vision XT 8.5, Noldus Information Technology). Additionally, all behaviors
were run on independent animal cohorts.
Radial Arm Water Maze. At 28 dpi, the focal TBI experiment groups (n = 8 sham +
vehicle, n = 8 sham + ISRIB, n = 16 TBI + vehicle, and n = 16 TBI + ISRIB) were
tested on the RAWM assay (34). The maze involved a pool 118.5 cm in diameter
with 8 arms, each 41 cm in length, and an escape platform that could be moved
(Fig. 1A). The pool was filled with water that was rendered opaque by adding
white paint (Crayola, 54–2128-053). Visual cues were placed around the room
such that they were visible to animals exploring the maze. Animals ran 15 trials a
day during training and 3 trials during each memory test. On the first training
day, the escape platform could be made visible by placing a flag that could
be seen above water on the platform. The escape platform alternated
between being visible and hidden for the first 12 trials. The final 3 trials of
the first day were all presented with a hidden platform. During the second
training day and the memory tests, the escape platform remained hidden.
Animals were trained for 2 d and then tested on memory tests 24 h and 7 d
after training.
During a trial, animals were placed in a random arm that did not include
the escape platform. Animals were allowed 1 min to locate the escape
platform. On successfully finding the platform, animals remained there for
10 s before being returned to their holding cage. On a failed trial, animals
were guided to the escape platform and then returned to their holding cage
10 s later. The escape platform location was the same, whereas the start arm
varied between trials for each individual animal. The escape platform loca-
tion was randomly assigned for each animal to account for any preferences of
exploration in the maze.
Animals were i.p. injected with either vehicle or ISRIB (2.5 mg/kg) starting
the day prior to behavior (27 dpi) and after each of the final trials of the
training days (28 and 29 dpi) for a total of three injections. No injections
were given when memory was tested on days 30 and 37 dpi.
RAWM data were collected through a video tracking and analysis setup
(Ethovision XT 8.5, Noldus Information Technology). The program auto-
matically analyzed the number of errors made per trial. Every three trials
were averaged into a block to account for large variability in performance;
each training day thus consisted of five blocks, whereas each memory test was
one block each. Furthermore, the experimenter was blinded to the treatment
groups during the behavioral assay.
Delayed-Matching-to-Place Paradigm. At 15 dpi, the concussive TBI experiment
groups (n = 12 sham + vehicle, n = 11 sham + ISRIB, n = 11 TBI + vehicle, and
n = 12 TBI + ISRIB) were tested on DMP using a modified Barnes maze (41).
The maze consisted of a round table 112 cm in diameter with 40 escape
holes arranged in three concentric rings consisting of 8, 16, and 16 holes at
20, 35, and 50 cm from the center of the maze, respectively. An escape
tunnel was connected to one of the outer holes. Visual cues were placed
around the room such that they were visible to animals on the table. Bright
overhead lighting and a loud tone (2 KHz, 85 db) were used as aversive
stimuli to motivate animals to locate the escape tunnel. The assay was
performed for 4 d (15–18 dpi). The escape tunnel location was moved for
each day and animals ran four trials per day.
During a trial, animals were placed onto the center of the table covered by
an opaque plastic box so they are not exposed to the environment. After they
had been placed on the table for 10 s, the plastic box was removed and the
tone started playing, marking the start of the trial. Animals were given 90 s to
explore the maze and locate the escape tunnel. Upon the animals successfully
locating and entering the escape tunnel, the tone was stopped. If the animals
failed to find the escape tunnel after 90 s, they were guided to the escape
tunnel before the tone was stopped. Animals remained in the escape tunnel
for 10 s before being returned to their home cage. The maze and escape
tunnel were cleaned with ethanol between each trial.
Animals were i.p. injected with either vehicle or ISRIB (2.5 mg/kg) starting the
day prior to behavior (14 dpi) and after the final trial of each day (15–17 dpi) for
a total of four injections. The experimenter was blind to the treatment groups
during the behavioral assay. Each trial was recorded using a video tracking and
analysis setup (Ethovision XT 8.5, Noldus Information Technology) and the
program automatically analyzed the amount of time required to locate the
escape tunnel. The escape latencies of trials 2, 3, and 4 were averaged as a
measure of ability to learn and perform the DMP task during the day.
Electrophysiology. Electrophysiological recordings were performed as pre-
viously described (22, 72, 73). Briefly, hippocampal slices (350 μm) were cut
from brains of sham and TBI (focal injury; n = 7–9 per group) mice in 4 °C
artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF), kept in ACSF at room temperature for at
least 1 hr before recording, and maintained in an interface-type chamber
perfused with oxygenated ACSF (95% O2 and 5% CO2) containing in milli-
moles: 124 NaCl, 2.0 KCl, 1.3 MgSO4, 2.5 CaCl2, 1.2 KH2PO4, 25 NaHCO3, and
10 glucose (2–3 mL/min). Bipolar stimulating electrodes were placed in the
CA1 stratum radiatum to stimulate Schaffer collateral and commissural fi-
bers. Field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) were recorded using
ACSF-filled micropipettes at 28–29 °C. The stimulus strength of the 0.1-ms
pulses was adjusted to evoke 30–35% of maximum response. LTP was eli-
cited by a train of high-frequency stimulation (100 Hz, 1 s). When indicated,
slices were treated with ISRIB (50 nM) for at least 30 min before stimulation
and throughout the entire recording.
Statistical Analysis. All statistical analyses were performed on GraphPad Prism
6 (GraphPad Software). Western blot quantification was analyzed by un-
paired Student’s t test. Behavioral data were analyzed by two-way analysis
of variance (ANOVA) with post hoc Bonferroni’s multiple comparison. Elec-
trophysiology data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA with post hoc
Bonferroni’s multiple comparison and n = number of slices. All data presented
are means ± SEM with significance set at P < 0.05.
