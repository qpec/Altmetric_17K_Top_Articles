Introduction
Tuberculosis is a major global public health 
problem, ranked in 2013 as the 11th leading 
cause of years of life lost globally (GBD 2013 
Mortality and Causes of Death Collaborators 
2014). One strategy for reducing the inci-
dence of tuberculosis has been through 
Mycobacterium bovis bacille Calmette–Guérin 
(BCG) vaccination. BCG is a live, attenuated 
vaccine typically administered around the 
time of birth. The BCG vaccine substantially 
reduces the risk of disseminated, severe forms 
of tuberculosis in early childhood (Trunz et al. 
2006), but the protection that early-life immu-
nization confers against pulmonary tubercu-
losis in older children and adults is variable 
and generally poor (Corbel et al. 2004; Fine 
1995). The reasons for the highly variable and 
less than ideal effectiveness of the BCG vaccine 
are not known, and have been debated, some-
times quite hotly, for many years (Abebe 
2012). However, generally overlooked in this 
discussion are the potential contributions of 
early-life exposures to the initial host response 
to BCG immunization or to the maintenance 
of immune protection it affords over time.
Recent evidence suggests that early-life 
chemical exposures alter the developing 
immune system, including decreased antibody 
responses to some vaccines. For example, 
higher polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs) 
and perfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) serum 
concentrations have been associated with 
lower responses to tetanus and diphtheria 
vaccines during childhood (Grandjean et al. 
2012; Heilmann et al. 2006), and higher 
maternal and infant PCB concentrations have 
been associated with a reduced volume of 
the infant thymus, the site of T-cell matura-
tion (Jusko et al. 2012). Development of the 
immune system is a complex and intricate 
process, requiring coordinated events that 
span gestation through early postnatal life. 
Even small changes to these events may lead 
to long-term alterations to immune function. 
Support for this idea comes from animal 
models that demonstrate that exposure to 
2,3,7,8-tetrachloro 
dibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) 
during gestation and shortly after birth results 
in functional changes that persist into adult 
life (Gehrs and Smialowicz 1999; Sugita-
Konishi et al. 2003; Vorderstrasse et al. 2004). 
Changes reported include alterations to the 
immune cells that control antibody produc-
tion and the formation of immunological 
memory, a fundamental tenet of vaccina-
tion strategies. Taken together, these studies 
suggest that chemical exposures occurring 
during early life may increase the susceptibility

Background: Reasons for the highly variable and often poor protection conferred by 
the Mycobacterium bovis bacille Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccine are multifaceted and 
poorly understood.
oBjectives: We aimed to determine whether early-life exposure to PCBs (polychlorinated 
 
biphenyls) and DDE [1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethylene] reduces 6-month infant BCG 
vaccine response.
Methods: Data came from families participating in a prospective birth cohort in eastern Slovakia. 
At birth, maternal and cord blood were collected for chemical analyses, and infants were immunized 
with BCG. Blood was collected from infants for chemical analyses and to determine 6-month 
BCG-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgA levels. Multivariable linear regression models were 
fit to examine chemical–BCG associations among approximately 500 mother–infant pairs, with 
adjustment for confounders.
results: The median 6-month infant concentration of the prevalent congener PCB-153 was 
113 ng/g lipid [interquartile range (IQR): 37–248], and 388 ng/g lipid (IQR: 115–847) for DDE. 
Higher 6-month infant concentrations of PCB-153 and DDE were strongly associated with lower 
6-month BCG-specific antibody levels. For instance, BCG-specific IgG levels were 37% lower 
for infants with PCB-153 concentrations at the 75th percentile compared to the 25th percentile 
(95% CI: –42, –32; p < 0.001). Results were similar in magnitude and precision for DDE. There 
was also evidence of PCB–DDE additivity, where exposure to both compounds reduced anti-BCG 
levels more than exposure to either compound alone.
conclusions: The associations observed in this study indicate that environmental exposures may 
be overlooked contributors to poorer responses to BCG vaccine. The overall association between 
these exposures and tuberculosis incidence is unknown.

to vaccine-preventable diseases in adulthood. 
Some authors have suggested that environ-
mental toxicants may be a “missing link” in 
the global battle against infectious disease 
(Winans et al. 2011).
In the present study we focused on 
two chemicals of concern, PCBs and DDE 
[1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)
ethylene]. Both organochlorines are considered 
persistent organic pollutants (POPs) that resist 
environmental and biological degradation, 
are lipophilic, and bioaccumulate in human 
tissues (ATSDR 2000, 2002). PCBs were once 
used in commercial and consumer applications 
because of their desirable physical and chemical 
properties (e.g., water insolubility, low flam-
mability, and chemical stability) (ATSDR 
2000). PCB levels have declined in human 
tissues in many parts of the world (Fängström 
et al. 2005). Yet there is still concern about 
their potential health effects, particularly 
among populations living in areas with signifi-
cant environmental contamination (Jusko 
et al. 2014; Pavuk et al. 2014) or those whose 
diet includes heavy consumption of PCB 
contaminated seafood (Ayotte et al. 2005; 
Fängström et al. 2005). DDE is the primary 
metabolite of DDT, an insecticide, which is 
still used in areas of the world where malaria 
vector control is needed (van den Berg 2009). 
Both DDE and PCBs can cross the placenta 
and mammary glands, and therefore can be 
readily passed from mother to infant (Al-Saleh 
et al. 2012; Glynn et al. 2011; Lancz et al. 
2015; Needham et al. 2011). To determine 
whether exposure to these POPs is associated 
with decreases in infant BCG-specific antibody 
levels, we conducted an investigation among a 
cohort of mother–infant pairs recruited from 
two districts in eastern Slovakia.
Methods
Study Population and Sample 
Selection
Mother–infant pairs participating in the 
present study were enrolled from two districts 
in eastern Slovakia: Michalovce, an area with 
substantial environmental PCB contamina-
tion (Kocan et al. 2001), and Svidnik, an area 
located approximately 70 km to the northwest. 
Pollution in the Michalovce region results, in 
part, from a chemical-manufacturing facility 
that produced PCBs between 1959 and 1984. 
Women were approached to participate in our 
study between 2002 and 2004 at the time they 
came to the local hospital in either Michalovce 
or Svidnik to deliver their child. At that time, 
mothers gave informed consent to participate. 
Because each district has only one hospital, the 
vast majority of women giving birth during 
this period delivered at either hospital. We 
excluded a) mothers with more than four 
previous births, b) mothers < 18 years of age, 
c) mothers who had resided < 5 years in their 
district, d) mothers with a major illness during 
pregnancy, and, after delivery, e) mothers of 
infants who had severe birth defects. In total, 
1,134 women were enrolled in both districts 
(811 in Michalovce and 323 in Svidnik). 
Mother–infant pairs were followed up by study 
staff for 6 months after the child’s birth, at 
which time 973 mother–infant pairs were still 
participating (86%). The study protocol was 
approved by institutional review boards at 
the University of California at Davis and the 
Slovak Medical University.
Blood Collection
Maternal blood was drawn during the mother’s 
delivery hospital stay, and cord blood was 
collected just after delivery. At the 6-month 
visit, up to 9 mL of blood was collected 
from the infant. Details on the handling of 
specimens and isolation of serum have been 
presented elsewhere (Jusko et al. 2010). From 
the isolated 6-month infant serum, approxi-
mately 500 μL was aliquoted into each micro-
tube (up to two tubes total) and stored frozen 
at –20°C. Of the 973 mother–infant pairs 
participating at 6-months, 960 infants (99%) 
received a 6-month blood draw, and a suffi-
cient volume of serum for anti-BCG analysis 
was available for 541.
Chemical Measurement
Maternal, cord, and 6-month infant chemical 
concentrations were determined at the 
Department of Toxic Organic Pollutants at 
the Slovak Medical University in Bratislava 
using high-resolution gas chromatography 
with electron capture detection (HP 5890; 
Hewlett-Packard). This laboratory serves as the 
National Reference Laboratory for Dioxins 
and Related Compounds for the Slovak 
Republic and has been certified by the Slovak 
National Accreditation Service (ISO/IEC 
17025:2005, certification no. S-111). Further, 
the laboratory participates in interlaboratory 
comparison tests, such as the Interlaboratory 
Quality Assessment coordinated by the World 
Health Organization (G-EQUAS 2009; 
WHO 2000). The concentrations of 15 PCB 
congeners [International Union of Pure and 
Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) numbers 28, 
52, 101, 105, 114, 118, 123+149, 138+163, 
153, 156+171, 157, 167, 170, 180, and 
189] and p,p´DDE were determined using 
a process which involved solid-phase extrac-
tion, cleanup, and quantitation (Conka et al. 
2005; Kocan et al. 1994). Quantification was 
based on the calibration curve generated by 
authentic PCB and DDE standard solutions 
at five different concentration levels. Quality 
control activities consisted of analyses of 
samples in batches of 10 run simultaneously 
with a blank sample and in-house reference 
material (spiked porcine serum); response for 
a particular congener had to be in the range 
of 90–110% using the concentration of the 
middle point of the calibration curves for that 
congener. We calculated the limit of detec-
tion (LOD) for each analyte by considering 
the ratio of background to noise (multiplied 
by three) and the peak height of the analyte 
in standard solution of the lowest concen-
tration. For a portion of 6-month samples 
(29%), high-resolution mass spectrometry 
(HRMS) (Chovancová et al. 2012) was used 
to quantitate PCB concentrations instead of 
high-resolution gas chromatography with 
electron capture detection, as these samples 
were analyzed subsequently with newer tech-
nology. The same laboratory performed both 
analytic procedures.
Lipid Measurement
Lipid concentrations were estimated by the 
enzymatic summation method (Akins et al. 
1989). Total serum cholesterol (TC) and 
triglyceride (TG) concentrations were 
determined at the Department of Clinical 
Biochemistry of TOP-MED General Hospital 
Bratislava using a DuPont Automatic Clinical 
Analyzer III, and cholesterol oxidase without 
cholesterol esterase was used to detect free 
cholesterol (FC). The method of Takayama 
et al. (1977) was used to determine serum 
choline–containing phospholipids (PL). Total 
serum lipids were calculated using the formula: 
TL = 1.677 × (TC – FC) + FC + TG + PL.
BCG Vaccination
During the study period in Slovakia, a 
mandatory BCG vaccination was given 
approximately 4 days after birth. The live, 
attenuated vaccine is given intradermally when 
mother and neonate are still in the hospital. 
According to the WHO and the United 
Nations Children’s Fund, 98% of all Slovak 
infants received this vaccination in the years 
2002–2004 (the years that children in our 
study were born) (WHO 2006). Infants in 
our cohort were vaccinated with one of three 
different BCG vaccines: a) BCG Behringer, 
strain Kopenhagen 1331; b) Lyophilized 
BCG, strain Mérieux (Glaxo/Sanofi) 1077; 
or c) BCG Statens Serum Institut, Danish 
strain 1331, as all three vaccines were in use 
in the Slovak Republic from 2002 to 2004 
(Otrusinik R, personal communication). After 
August 2004, BCG SSI was used exclusively.
BCG-Specific Antibody Enzyme-
Linked Immunosorbant Assay
BCG-specific antibody levels in serially 
diluted 6-month infant serum samples were 
determined by stacking antibody isotype-
specific enzyme-linked immunoassay 
(ELISA), as previously described (Boule et al. 
2014). BCG was purchased from Sanofi 
Pasteur and reconstituted and diluted as per 
 PCB and DDE exposure and infant anti-BCG response

manufacturer instructions. Coating antigen 
was prepared by sonication and heat inacti-
vation (Shirtcliffe et al. 2004). Because we 
did not know which BCG vaccine formula-
tion infants received, we piloted the ELISA 
using both Sanofi and SSI strains (the two 
main strains that infants were vaccinated 
with). A comparison of results for the two 
strains revealed that absorbance values were 
strongly correlated for both immunoglobulin 
(Ig) G and IgA (r > 0.9), suggesting that 
the measured anti-BCG levels would not be 
strain dependent. Because the Sanofi strain 
produced slightly higher absorbance values 
(data not shown), it was chosen as the coating 
antigen for analyses. Ninety-six–well plates 
were coated with BCG at 0.1 μg/mL for IgG 
isotype measurements and 0.5 μg/mL for the 
IgA isotype. Six-month infant serum samples 
were prepared in a series of 3-fold dilutions 
ranging from 1:25 to 1:6,075. A serially 
diluted reference sample was used on all 
plates. Biotinylated goat anti-human IgG or 
IgA antibodies (Southern Biotech) were used 
to detect and compare the relative amount of 
each antibody isotype.
Questionnaires and Medical 
Records
After enrollment at the time of delivery, 
women were administered a questionnaire 
by trained staff which elicited information 
about maternal health, past pregnancies, 
tobacco use, family living environment, and 
socio 
demographic information. No women 
reported tuberculosis infection during preg-
nancy. The lack of maternal or infant tuber-
culosis infection through age 6 months was 
confirmed by the study physician. Women 
were considered smokers if they reported 
smoking during pregnancy or stated that they 
were a current smoker at the delivery inter-
view. Romani ethnicity was assigned if the 
ethnic origin of either of the mother’s parents 
was Romani, the Romani language was 
spoken at home, or the mother was planning 
to raise her child with the Romani language. 
Otherwise, ethnicity was assigned as Slovak/
other European. From the newborn medical 
record, we abstracted information about the 
perinatal health of the infant and the child’s 
birth weight and gestation length. Gestation 
length was based on the date of the woman’s 
last menstrual period and the judgment of 
her physician. An additional questionnaire 
was administered during the infant’s 6-month 
visit, which took place at either hospital in the 
Department of Pediatrics. The questionnaire 
included questions about the home environ-
ment of the child and breastfeeding habits. 
Mothers were asked whether they were pres-
ently breastfeeding, and if not, when they 
stopped. They were also asked if and when 
they began using a milk substitute.
Pharmacokinetic Modeling 
of Postnatal PCB and DDE 
Concentrations
To estimate additional PCB-153 and 
p,p´-DDE exposure parameters beyond the 
measured concentrations, we used a previously 
validated physiologically based pharmaco-
kinetic (PBPK) model (Verner et al. 2013) 
that incorporates information on the mother’s 
age at delivery, prepregnancy body weight, 
gestational weight gain, infant’s weight at 
birth and at 6 months, gestational age at birth, 
the duration of breastfeeding and exclusivity, 
infant’s sex, maternal and cord plasma concen-
trations, and the half-lives of PCB-153 and 
p,p´-DDE. For each child in the study, we esti-
mated monthly postnatal concentrations from 
1 to 6 months, the cumulative exposure during 
the first 6 months [i.e., the area under the 
concentration × time curve (AUC)], and the 
peak concentration reached during that period. 
We also estimated peak and AUC measures for 
the entire pre- and postnatal period.
Data Analysis
PCB and DDE concentration. For the present 
analysis, we used PCB-153 (hereafter, PCB) 
as a surrogate for the 15 total PCB conge-
ners measured in serum. This was done for 
two reasons: a) PCB-153 is highly correlated 
with total PCB concentration in this cohort 
(ρ > 0.99 for maternal, cord, and 6-month 
exposures), and b) PCB-153 was detectable 
in all maternal and infant specimens. For the 
< 1% of p,p´-DDE (hereafter, DDE) concen-
trations that were below a limit of detection, 
we used the values as reported by the labo-
ratory (i.e., no substitution or imputation). 
Two maternal, three cord, and two DDE 
measures were below a limit of detection.
Statistical models. The outcome vari-
ables—BCG-specific IgG and IgA levels—
were modeled as the absorbance value 
recorded from the ELISA plate. From the 
3-fold dilutions ranging from 1:25 to 
1:6,075, we modeled the 1:225 dilution 
because this was in the middle of the linear 
range of the dilution curve (see Figures S1–
S3). Absorbance values were transformed by 
the natural log to normalize residuals.
To select potential confounding variables, 
we created a directed acyclic graph (DAG) 
(Greenland et al. 1999) to identify a minimally 
sufficient set of adjustment variables to reduce 
confounding. We regarded the causal struc-
ture of the maternal and cord exposure models 
to be identical, and adjusted these models 
for ethnicity (Slovak/other European vs. 
Romani), maternal smoking (yes/no), educa-
tion (< 12, 12–16, or ≥ 17 years), parity (0–4), 
and maternal age at the child’s birth (years). 
Six-month exposure models included adjust-
ment for ethnicity, maternal age, and maternal 
education (DAGs not shown). Because the 
role of breastfeeding as a confounder of the 
postnatal PCB/DDE–anti-BCG association 
can be debated, 6-month exposure models are 
presented both with and without adjustment 
for the duration of exclusive breastfeeding 
(months). For the PBPK models, postnatal 
only models were adjusted for the same set 
of potential confounders as the 6-month 
models above, except that exclusive breast-
feeding duration was truncated at the exposure 
time point of interest (e.g., the duration was 
truncated at 3 months in the 3-month PBPK 
regression model). PBPK models that included 
both the pre- and postnatal period used 
the same covariate set as the maternal/cord 
exposure models, and results are shown both 
with and without adjustment for exclusive 
breastfeeding duration. Chemical concentra-
tions were modeled as natural log transformed 
concentrations on a per lipid basis (nanograms 
per gram lipid), and estimated associations 
are reported as the percent difference in the 
relative absorbance level for an interquartile 
range difference in exposure. The MIXED 
procedure in SAS was used to estimate each 
chemical–BCG level association and associated 
95% confidence interval and p-value (version 
9.4; SAS Institute Inc.). In light of research on 
endocrine-disrupting compounds and observa-
tions of sexually dimorphic findings in terms 
of neurodevelopment and other developmental 
processes, we initially examined measured 
chemical concentrations and anti-BCG levels 
by stratifying on infant sex, but found little 
evidence of heterogeneity (data not shown), 
and therefore report chemical–anti-BCG 
 
associations without sex stratification.
First, we examined individual associations 
between maternal, cord, and 6-month infant 
PCB concentrations and BCG-specific IgG 
and IgA. Identical models then addressed 
maternal, cord, and 6-month infant DDE in 
relation to BCG-specific IgG and IgA. Then, 
to assess the unique contributions of PCB and 
DDE, several approaches were taken. First, 
because PCB and DDE concentrations were 
only moderately correlated for the maternal 
(ρ = 0.54; p < 0.0001) and cord measures 
(ρ = 0.55; p < 0.0001), we included models 
with simultaneous inclusion of both expo-
sures. A second approach was used for the 
6-month chemical–BCG associations, owing 
to the strong correlation between PCB and 
DDE (ρ = 0.86). We dichotomized each 
chemical exposure at the median into “high” 
and “low” exposure categories. Anti-BCG 
antibody levels were then modeled as a 
function of dummy-coded PCB and DDE 
variables and the interaction between the two 
(i.e., main effects for both PCB and DDE, 
and the interaction term). This parameteriza-
tion allowed the estimation of, and contrasts 
between, the four categories of exposure: 
a) low PCB and low DDE; b) low PCB and 
 Jusko et al.

high DDE; c) high PCB and low DDE; and 
d) high PCB and high DDE, and permitted 
us to statistically evaluate the presence or 
absence of exposure additivity between 
6-month PCB and DDE concentrations.
Sensitivity analyses. We conducted a 
series of sensitivity analyses. These models 
were identical to our primary 6-month infant 
PCB/DDE and BCG-specific IgG model, 
except that a) PCB/DDE concentration was 
entered into the regression model on a wet-
weight basis (nanograms per milliliter) and 
6-month infant total lipid concentration was 
included as a separate covariate (Schisterman 
et al. 2005); b) we included additional covari-
ates that either did not meet the criteria for 
our DAG but have been reported in the liter-
ature as potential confounders of the relation 
between PCB/DDE and immune function 
or may be strong predictors of the outcome 
[maternal smoking, parity, district of resi-
dence (Michalovce or Svidnik), and child 
age at 6-month blood draw (essentially “time 
since vaccination”)]; c) we added a categorical 
variable for the BCG ELISA batch date; d) we 
added an indicator variable to the primary 
model for high-resolution gas chromatog-
raphy with electron capture detection versus 
HRMS, to confirm that the 29% of 6-month 
infant serum samples analyzed by HRMS did 
not bias our results; e) we removed the top 
and bottom 3% of PCB/DDE concentra-
tions to evaluate the influence of extreme 
values; and f) we combined all the previous 
sensitivity model specifications to evaluate the 
total effect of these alternative specifications.
Results
Study Population
Table 1 shows characteristics of the 541 
mother–infant pairs who had adequate 
6-month serum for the measurement of BCG 
antibody levels, the complete group of those 
followed-up at 6 months (n = 973), and the 
full cohort (n = 1,134). Overall, these subsets 
of the cohort were very similar. Among the 
541 mother–infant pairs in the present study, 
50% of infants were female, 1% were born 
preterm (< 37 weeks of gestation), and 5% of 
infants were born low birth weight (< 2,500 
g). The majority (81%) of infants were of 
Slovak or other European ethnicity, and 19% 
were Romani. Of the 541 mother–infant pairs 
with adequate serum for the measurement 
of BCG antibody levels, complete data for 
the multivariable models (discussed below) 
were available for 480 mother–infant pairs 
in maternal exposure models, 492 in models 
that used cord blood concentrations, and 454 
in models where 6-month infant concentra-
tions were the exposure of interest. For the 
PBPK models, up to 517 mother–infant pairs 
were included.
PCB and DDE Concentrations
PCB and DDE concentrations were detected 
in > 99% of maternal and infant samples 
(Table 2). PCB concentrations were highest 
in maternal serum (median, 150 ng/g lipid), 
compared with cord (median, 115 ng/g lipid) 
and 6-month infant serum (median, 113 ng/g 
lipid); DDE showed a similar pattern of 
median lipid-basis concentration over time 
(Table 2). PCB and DDE concentrations had 
higher extreme values at 6 months compared 
with maternal or cord concentrations. The 
cross-sectional correlation between PCB and 
DDE concentrations on a wet-weight basis was 
strongest at 6 months (ρ = 0.86; p < 0.0001) 
compared with cord (ρ = 0.55; p < 0.0001) 
and maternal serum (ρ = 0.54; p < 0.0001)

concentrations were predictive of 6-month 
infant PCB concentrations (0.37 ≤ ρ ≤ 0.38; 
p < 0.0001) and maternal and cord DDE 
concentrations were predictive of 6-month 
infant PCB concentrations (0.42 ≤ ρ ≤ 0.45;

of exclusive breastfeeding and 6-month PCB 
was ρ = 0.63 (p < 0.0001), and the correlation 
between duration of exclusive breastfeeding 
and 6-month DDE was ρ = 0.63 (p < 0.0001).

 PCB and DDE exposure and infant anti-BCG response
Environmental Health Perspectives • volume 124 | number 6 | June 2016 
817
Measured PCB and DDE 
Concentrations in Relation to 
6-Month Anti-BCG Levels
Maternal (n = 480) and cord (n = 492) serum 
PCB and DDE concentrations showed little 
evidence of dose response with IgG-specific 
anti-BCG levels in adjusted models, though 
there was some evidence of an association 
between cord PCB concentrations and 
BCG-specific IgA levels (Figure 1; see also 
Table S1 for regression results). The inclu-
sion of both chemicals in maternal and 
cord models did not appreciably change the 
estimated associations. In contrast, higher 
6-month infant PCB and DDE concentra-
tions were associated with lower BCG-specific 
antibody levels, after adjusting for maternal 
ethnicity, education, and age. BCG-specific 
IgG levels were 37% lower, on average, for 
participants with PCB concentrations at the 
75th percentile compared to the 25th percen-
tile [95% confidence interval (CI): –42, –32; 
p < 0.001], and estimates for DDE were very 
similar in magnitude and precision. The esti-
mated associations for both 6-month PCB 
and DDE were attenuated by approximately 
50% after additional adjustment for duration 
of exclusive breastfeeding. The dose response 
across quartiles of 6-month serum PCB and 
DDE concentration was apparent regardless 
of the serum dilution (see Figure S3).
In the 6-month infant serum PCB 
and DDE multivariable models (n = 454), 
Romani infants had BCG-specific IgG levels 
approximately 30% lower than Slovak/other 
European infants. When duration of exclusive 
breastfeeding was included as a covariate, each 
month of exclusive breastfeeding was asso-
ciated with a 12% lower BCG-specific IgG 
level; other covariates were not meaningfully 
predictive of BCG-specific IgG level (data 
not shown).
PBPK Models and Anti-BCG Levels
PCB. AUC PCB models that included 
both the pre- and postnatal period showed 
evidence of an inverse association with 
IgG- and IgA-specific BCG antibody levels, 
though the association was slightly stronger 
for IgA-specific antibody levels (Figure 2; see 
also Table S2 for regression results). Peak 
PCB concentration during the pre- and post-
natal period was also associated with lower 
BCG-specific antibody levels. Postnatal 
month–specific results were consistent with 
findings from the measured maternal, cord, 
and 6-month infant analyses: PCB measure-
ments closest to birth were not associated with 
anti-BCG antibody level, whereas estimates 
of exposure closest to 6 months of age were 
strongly and inversely associated. The post-
natal AUC measure of PCB exposure, as esti-
mated from the PBPK model, was strongly 
and inversely associated with antibody levels; 
the peak exposure variable was attenuated 
compared to the AUC measure (despite the 
peak exposure having a larger interquartile 
range: peak AUC IQR = 240, postnatal 
AUC IQR = 195; see also Table S2). In this 
population, an IQR difference in postnatal 
AUC PCB exposure was associated with a 
14% lower BCG-specific IgG level (95% CI: 
–20, –8) (see Table S2). As with the measured 
6-month infant serum PCB concentrations, 
results from the PBPK models were attenu-
ated after adjustment for duration of exclusive 
breastfeeding (see Table S2).
DDE. Compared with PCB, AUC and 
peak DDE concentrations for the pre- and 
postnatal period were not as strongly associated 
with BCG-specific antibody levels (Figure 3; 
see also Table S3). Like PCB, however, month-
specific DDE concentrations more proximal 
to 6 months were more strongly associated 
with lower BCG-specific antibody levels, and 
postnatal AUC measures of DDE exposure 
were inversely associated with BCG-specific 
antibody levels. Adjustment for duration of 
exclusive breastfeeding again attenuated 
most associations.

PCB and DDE exposure as above or below 
the median (see also Table S4). For both IgG 
and IgA isotypes, a clear dose response was 
evident: Infants with PCB and DDE concen-
trations above the median (“high/high”) had 
the lowest antibody levels, whereas infants 
who were below the median for PCB and 
DDE (“low/low”) had higher antibody levels 
(above median PCB and DDE group vs. 
below median PCB and DDE group: –94%; 
95% CI: –116, –74). Concentrations above 
the median of either PCB or DDE but not 
the other showed BCG levels intermediate 
to the low/low and high/high groups. The 
contrast between high PCB/low DDE and 
low PCB/low DDE tended to be greater than 
the contrast between high DDE/low PCB and 
low PCB/low DDE regardless of antibody 
isotype. In both IgG and IgA models, adjust-
ment for breastfeeding tended to attenuate 
the differences between exposure categories. 
Evidence of joint effects for PCB and DDE 
was also observed: For IgA-specific anti-BCG 
levels, exposure to both compounds appeared 
to be additive, and for IgG-specific anti-BCG, 
more than additive. For example, IgA-specific 
anti-BCG levels were 85% lower in the high 
PCB/high DDE group relative to the low 
PCB/low DDE group, compared with 70% 
lower in the high PCB/low DDE group and 
15% lower in the low PCB/high DDE group, 
relative to the low PCB/low DDE group. 
For IgG, anti-BCG levels were 94% lower 
in the high PCB/high DDE group relative 
to the low PCB/low DDE group, compared 
with 36% lower in the high PCB/low DDE 
group and 11% lower in the low PCB/high 
DDE group, relative to the low PCB/low 
DDE group, suggesting more than additive 
joint effects. Consistent with the estimated 
contrasts above, there was a statistical inter-
action between 6-month PCB and DDE 
concentration on IgG-specific BCG levels, 
both in models unadjusted for breastfeeding 
duration (p = 0.012) and adjusted for breast-
feeding duration (p = 0.066), but there was 
little evidence for statistical PCB × DDE 
 
interaction in IgA-specific models.
Sensitivity Analyses
Overall, results using different model specifi-
cations or truncating the PCB/DDE concen-
trations did not meaningfully differ from our 
primary model (see Figure S4).
Discussion
The results from this prospective birth cohort 
study suggest that two common environmental 
contaminants, PCB-153 and p,p´-DDE, 
substantially reduce the infant response to 
BCG vaccination. Six-month infant PCB 
and DDE concentrations were strongly and 
inversely associated with BCG-specific IgG 
and IgA levels measured at 6 months, and the 
estimated associations were precise. The results 
from models using estimated concentrations 
from validated PBPK models were in accor-
dance with results from measured chemical 
concentrations in serum, suggesting that post-
natal exposures more proximal to the outcome 
are most strongly associated with lower 
anti-BCG antibody levels. Finally, we observed 
evidence of exposure additivity, where infants 
with high exposures to both compounds 
exhibited lower BCG-specific antibody levels 
compared to infants with high concentrations 
of either compound.
In this study, higher measured postnatal 
concentrations of PCBs and DDE were 
associated with lower antibody levels, but 
measured perinatal concentrations (maternal 
and cord) were not. Interestingly, a similar 
finding was observed in this cohort in relation 
to PCBs with thymus volume, also measured 
at 6 months of age in the infant. In that 
study, where thymus volume was estimated 
using ultrasound, 6-month total PCB concen-
tration was associated with a 0.4–standard 
deviation decrease in thymus volume, whereas 
total maternal PCB concentration was not 
associated with altered thymus volume (Jusko 
et al. 2012). Evidence of the post- versus 
prenatal association has also been observed 
in other cohort studies. For instance, in a

 PCB and DDE exposure and infant anti-BCG response
Environmental Health Perspectives • volume 124 | number 6 | June 2016

study of mother–child pairs highly exposed 
to PCBs in the Faroe Islands, PCB concentra-
tions were determined in maternal and child 
serum, and antibody levels were measured 
at 18 months of age (Heilmann et al. 2006). 
Results from that study showed that higher 
postnatal rather than prenatal PCB concen-
trations were associated with lower 18-month 
diphtheria and tetanus toxoid levels. The 
responses to diphtheria and tetanus toxoid 
vaccination were also assessed in the Faroese 
cohort at age 5 and 7 years. At the later 
childhood examination, 18-month child 
PCB concentrations were most predictive 
of vaccine response, compared to prepreg-
nancy, milk, or concurrent PCB concentra-
tions (Heilmann et al. 2010). Experimental 
studies in rodents also show that early post-
natal exposure, via mothers’ milk, signifi-
cantly perturbed adaptive immune responses 
in adult offspring, whereas developmental 
exposure solely during gestation had a less 
pronounced effect (Hogaboam et al. 2008). 
Given that the immune system starts to 
develop in utero but continues to develop 
after birth, the results of the present study 
and others suggest that the early postnatal 
period is a critical period for immune system 
development and for its particular sensitivity 
to perturbation by environmental agents.
In addition to the measured chemical 
concentrations in maternal, cord, and 
6-month infant serum, the use of a vali-
dated PBPK model permitted estimation of 
exposure metrics during the postnatal period 
(AUC, peak, and month-specific concentra-
tions), as well as metrics spanning both the 
gestational and the postnatal period (AUC 
and peak). Overall, the estimated inverse 
association between chemical concentration 
and BCG-specific antibody levels from the 
PBPK models tended to be stronger for PCB 
than DDE. There was also evidence that the 
PCB–antibody association was stronger than 
the DDE–antibody association when both 
exposures were dichotomized and modeled 
simultaneously. At the same time, there was 
a suggestion that, for infants with both PCB 
and DDE above the median, the decrease 
in IgG-specific BCG antibody levels was 
greater than expected based on the decreases 
in IgG associated with high PCB alone and 
high DDE alone. Taken as a whole, these 
results suggest that a) PCBs exert a greater 
influence on anti-BCG antibody levels 
than does DDE, and b) that the combina-
tion of both exposures may more adversely 
affect anti-BCG antibody levels, compared 
with either exposure individually. A strength 
of using PBPK models in addition to our 
measured concentrations is that we were able 
to estimate peak concentrations spanning the 
postnatal as well as the combined pre- and 
postnatal period. Interestingly, we observed 
stronger associations with estimated 6-month 
infant concentrations compared with peak 
concentrations. This finding suggests that 
the association between PCB and DDE and 
anti-BCG level is time- and dose-specific, 
rather than only dose-specific. This provides 
further evidence that the early postnatal period 
may be a critical period during which envi-
ronmental exposures perturb the developing 
immune system.
These analyses also provide intriguing 
evidence to support that the chemical–
antibody associations differed by antibody 
isotype, particularly for PCB exposure. For 
instance, there was some suggestion that 
higher cord PCB concentration was associ-
ated with lower IgA- but not IgG-specific 
BCG antibody levels. This was also evidenced 
in the PBPK models examining AUC and 
peak concentrations (pre- and postnatal). 
Furthermore, when examining the combined 
exposure of PCB and DDE, IgA was less 
strongly associated with DDE, compared with 
PCB. For instance, the BCG-specific antibody 
level in the high PCB/high DDE group was 
only 9% lower than the high PCB/low DDE 
group for the IgA isotype (Figure 4C), but 
42% lower comparing those same groups for 
IgG-specific BCG (Figure 4A). Thus, there 
may be differences in the association between 
PCB and DDE exposure and anti-BCG 
levels for different antibody isotypes. The 
switching of these isotypes is controlled, to a 
large extent, by external signals delivered to 
B cells by CD4+ T cells. Therefore, differences 
in relative levels of vaccine-specific antibody 
isotypes suggest that environmental expo-
sures may also influence T-cell functions that 
contribute to the generation and maintenance 
of optimal responses to vaccination.
Previously in this cohort, we examined 
early-life PCB exposure in relation to 6-month 
IgG-specific anti-Haemophilus influenzae 
type b, tetanus toxoid, and diphtheria 
toxoid (Jusko et al. 2010) as well as 6-month 
measures of total IgG, IgA, IgM, and IgE 
(Jusko et al. 2011). In neither study did we 
observe associations between maternal or 
6-month PCB exposure and specific or total 
immunoglobulin concentrations. Compared 
with diphtheria, tetanus, and Haemophilus 
vaccines, BCG is a live, attenuated vaccine, 
and because of this it elicits a greater number 
of effector mechanisms in the immune system 
(Siegrist 2001). Thus, if immune dysfunc-
tion from POP exposure truly exists, then the 
comprehensive nature of the immune response 
to BCG increases the likelihood of detecting 
an association, and may explain the positive 
findings of the present study compared with 
Figure 4. Six-month infant serum PCB and DDE concentrations, categorized as above (“high”) and/or 
below (“low”) the median value, in relation to 6-month BCG-specific IgG (A,B) and IgA (C,D). Results are 
adjusted for maternal ethnicity, education, and age (A,C) and maternal ethnicity, education, age, and 
duration of exclusive breastfeeding (B,D). Adjusted numerical estimates are available in Table S4.

our null findings using other antigen-specific 
outcomes. Similarly, the null results observed 
for total immunoglobulin concentrations 
(Jusko et al. 2011) may be explained by their 
lack of specificity. Total immunoglobulins 
include all antibodies in an extremely large 
(> 108) antibody repertoire. Thus, subtle 
changes involving functional capacity of the 
immune system may go undetected when 
nonspecific measures such as total antibody 
concentrations are used in lieu of more precise 
and specific assessments (Luster et al. 2005).
The estimated association between 
6-month infant PCB and DDE concentra-
tions and anti-BCG antibody levels was rela-
tively large. For instance, we estimated that 
for both 6-month PCB and 6-month DDE, 
an IQR increase in concentration was associ-
ated with a 37% reduction in anti-BCG IgG 
antibody levels. As in any observational epide-
miological study, the magnitude of these asso-
ciations raises concerns about the possibility 
of positive confounding. However, fitting 
additional 6-month PCB and DDE models 
that included additional covariate adjust-
ment beyond our prespecified set of covari-
ates suggested that the observed associations 
are unlikely to be attributable to unmeasured 
confounding. The relative lack of a change 
in the crude association following covariate 
adjustment is a finding that is consistent with 
previous findings from this cohort (Jusko 
et al. 2010) and others (Heilmann et al. 2010) 
and suggests that confounding of the POP–
antibody association, empirically evaluated in 
these populations, is minimal.
Inclusion of duration of exclusive breast-
feeding in the 6-month infant serum and 
PBPK models tended to attenuate the 
chemical–antibody level associations, because 
longer breastfeeding was associated with lower 
BCG antibody levels and higher postnatal 
PCB and DDE concentrations. Although the 
finding that longer breastfeeding is associated 
with a poorer response to BCG vaccination 
seems paradoxical, a significant literature 
supports the idea that the relationship between 
breastfeeding and vaccine responses is complex. 
For instance, studies have reported enhanced, 
decreased, or no difference in the immune 
response to some vaccinations, comparing 
breastfed to non-breastfed infants (Dórea 
2012). For BCG vaccines specifically, one 
study observed that breastfeeding enhanced 
lymphocyte blastogenesis (stimulated by 
purified protein derivative of Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis) (Pabst et al. 1989), and a second 
study, that examined Mantoux test results at 
6 months, found no difference in tuberculin 
response size across different strata of breast-
feeding duration (Goh et al. 1989). Whether 
breastfeeding is a true confounder or a proxy 
of exposure that drives its inverse association 
with anti-BCG antibody levels is difficult to 
determine. Nevertheless, we observed strong 
inverse associations between 6-month infant 
chemical concentrations and BCG-specific 
antibody levels even with adjustment for 
duration of exclusive breastfeeding.
Despite the advantages of our study, two 
limitations deserve mention. First, PCB and 
DDE concentrations in our population were 
highly correlated, so fully disentangling their 
separate associations with anti-BCG antibody 
levels was not possible. Although the poten-
tial immunotoxicity of PCBs and dioxin-like 
compounds has been studied in human and 
animals studies (Gascon et al. 2013; Lawrence 
and Kerkvliet 2006), far fewer studies have 
examined the potential immunotoxic effects 
of DDE. Indeed, a recent review of literature 
regarding POPs and immune outcomes did not 
identify any human studies evaluating early-life 
DDE exposure and antibody-specific outcomes 
(Gascon et al. 2013). The lack of prior vaccine-
specific antibody studies of DDE in animals 
or humans contributes to the uncertainty of 
whether the DDE–BCG antibody association 
may be causal, or whether this association is 
due entirely to the strong positive correlation 
between PCB and DDE concentrations in this 
population. Our categorical analysis of high 
and low concentrations of both compounds 
suggests that the inverse associations between 
DDE and anti-BCG antibody levels are not 
solely the result of correlated exposures.
A second limitation concerns our ability 
to determine whether the PCB-associated 
decreases in anti-BCG IgG and IgA levels 
were attributable to dioxin-like effects on the 
aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) or mecha-
nisms independent of the AHR. Dioxin-like 
compounds (including some PCB congeners) 
bind AHR, which is known to modulate the 
immune response. However, our method of 
chemical analysis was predominantly based 
on high-resolution gas chromatography with 
electron capture detection, rather than HRMS. 
As a consequence, many of the values for PCB 
congeners with dioxin-like activity were below 
the limit of detection, or co-eluted with other 
non–dioxin-like PCBs (e.g., PCB-156+171). 
Although suppression of the immune response 
following exposure to non–dioxin-like PCBs 
has been observed in experimental studies in 
animals (Lyche et al. 2004, 2006), disentan-
gling health effects with highly-correlated PCB 
congeners in human populations is problem-
atic. Even though PCB-153 (a non–dioxin-
like PCB) was the exposure of interest in the 
present study, PCB-153 concentration among 
adults in our population has been correlated 
with the total WHO toxic equivalency (TEQ) 
(ρ ≥ 0.58), a measure of dioxin-like activity 
(Van den Berg et al. 2006). Thus, it is diffi-
cult to determine whether our PCB-associated 
findings derive from AHR-dependent or 
 
independent mechanisms.
Conclusions
Although our findings for PCB-153, a 
common PCB congener observed in most 
populations around the world (Longnecker 
et al. 2003), are remarkable, our results for 
DDE, the main metabolite of DDT, are also 
noteworthy. The reduced antibody response to 
BCG with increasing DDE concentrations was 
observed at concentrations of DDE that are far 
below those seen in areas where indoor residual 
spraying is used for malaria vector control 
(Whitworth et al. 2014). Thus, our findings 
may have particular implications for areas of 
the world where DDT is used for malaria 
vector control, and where, interestingly, rates 
of tuberculosis are also highest (WHO 2015). 
In sum, the data presented here provide strong, 
new evidence that environmental chemicals 
may lower the response to the vaccine against 
tuberculosis, a disease responsible for a signifi-
cant portion of the world’s morbidity and 
mortality. These data further emphasize that 
environmental exposures are likely overlooked 
but critical contributors to the global burden of 
infectious diseases.
