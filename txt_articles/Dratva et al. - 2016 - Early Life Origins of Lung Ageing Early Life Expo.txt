Abstract
Objectives
Early life environment is essential for lung growth and maximally attained lung function.
Whether early life exposures impact on lung function decline in adulthood, an indicator of
lung ageing, has scarcely been studied.
Methods
Spirometry data from two time points (follow-up time 9–11 years) and information on early
life exposures, health and life-style were available from 12862 persons aged 28–73 years
participating in the European population-based cohorts SAPALDIA (n = 5705) and ECRHS
(n = 7157). The associations of early life exposures with lung function (FEV1) decline were
analysed using mixed-effects linear regression.

 Results
Early life exposures were significantly associated with FEV1 decline, with estimates almost
as large as personal smoking. FEV1 declined more rapidly among subjects born during the
winter season (adjusted difference in FEV1/year of follow-up [95%CI] -2.04ml [-3.29;-0.80]),
of older mothers, (-1.82 ml [-3.14;-0.49]) of smoking mothers (-1.82ml [-3.30;-0.34] or with
younger siblings (-2.61ml [-3.85;-1.38]). Less rapid FEV1-decline was found in subjects who
had attended daycare (3.98ml [2.78;5.18]), and indicated in subjects with pets in childhood
(0.97ml [-0.16;2.09]). High maternal age and maternal smoking appeared to potentiate
effects of personal smoking. The effects were independent of asthma at any age.
Conclusion
Early life factors predicted lung function decline decades later, suggesting that some mech-
anisms related lung ageing may be established early in life. Early life programming of sus-
ceptibility to adult insults could be a possible pathway that should be explored further.
Introduction
Early childhood is a critical time window for subsequent lung health. Adverse childhood envi-
ronmental exposures can restrain growth[1], modulate lung function [1, 2] and induce changes
to gene-expression, modulating airway pathophysiology.[3, 4] The impact of a range of early
life factors have been evidenced such as parental life-style [5, 6], nutrition [7] ambient air pol-
lution [8, 9] or viral infections.[10] Epigenetic programming has been suggested as an underly-
ing mechanism leading to less favourable long term respiratory health outcomes. [7, 11–13]
Emerging research suggests that not only lung growth, but also lung ageing, may be pro-
grammed early in life [14, 15]. Lung ageing encompasses the physiological as well as pathologi-
cal processes which lead to altered lung function and lung diseases with increasing age. [16]
Lung function decline is on one hand a normal ageing process, on the other hand it can be
potentiated by risk factors, such as smoking [17, 18] or obesity.[17, 19] Early life impact on
adult respiratory health is relatively well documented [20–23]. However, the potential impact
on lung function decline by early life factors has been scarcely studied and remains inconsis-
tent. Svanes et al., for example, shows that a childhood disadvantage score, including childhood
asthma, predicted more rapid lung function decline in middle aged adults [21] and Jackson
et al. evidenced earlier and quicker lung function decline for young adults with lower childhood
SES [24] whereas Marossy et al. found no significant association between lung function decline
in adults age 35–45 and early life respiratory infections.[25]
Smoking is known as the main adult risk factor for accelerated lung function decline; how-
ever, causes for varying susceptibility to tobacco exposure between individuals are not well
understood. Early life factors, in particular parental smoking, have been hypothesized to play a
role for modifying susceptibility.[26–28]. No previous study on early life factors has yet fol-
lowed participants into old age or had the power to investigate individual early life factors in
sufficient detail. We wished to investigate the hypotheses i) that early life factors may predict
lung function decline, independent of childhood or parental asthma and ii) that one potential
pathway might be through altered susceptibility to adult insults like smoking.

Material and Methods
Study population
The study population consists of 12862 subjects of the SAPALDIA [29] and the ECRHS cohort.
[30] Both studies have been described in detail elsewhere. In short, the SAPALDIA study popu-
lation was recruited in 1991 as a population–based, random sample of adults (N = 9651, age
20–60 years) from eight study areas in Switzerland.[29] In the second assessment in 2002/03,
lung function measures as well as the questionnaire on socio-demographic characteristics, life-
style factors, living, housing and work related characteristics and health status, were repeated.
Lung function data from both surveys was available for 5705 participants and mean follow-up
time was 10.9 years. In ECRHS I, a random sample of adults aged 20–44 years were recruited
in 29 centres (N = 13 359).[30] 7157 participants with lung function measures at two time
points (at ECRHS I in1991–1993 and at ECRHS II in 1998–2002), were included into the anal-
yses. The mean follow-up time was 8.8 years. The two cohorts have coordinated study design,
questionnaires and common standards for interview and clinical examinations which allows
for analyses of the combined data sets. Each study centre received approval by the institutional
or regional ethics committee (S1 Text), and all participants signed informed consents.
Because of the large number of study centres, and the large number of study participants
from Switzerland, the study centres were categorised into four European regions: Southern
(Spain, France-Montpellier, Central (Switzerland, France-Grenoble and Italy-Pavia, -Turin,
-Verona), Northern (Iceland, Sweden, Norway, Estonia) and Western Europe (Great-Britain,
Belgium, France-Bordeaux and -Paris; S1 Fig).
Early life factors
Information on early life characteristics was collected by an interview-led questionnaire assess-
ing serious respiratory infection <2 years, day care attendance <5 years, bedroom sharing,
older and younger siblings, maternal age at delivery, season of birth (winter, defined as born in
November to end of January, versus other seasons), paternal and/or maternal smoking during
childhood, childhood pet keeping and urban living environment (large town vs. small town or
farm/village) (S5 Table).
Lung function measurements
Spirometry testing in both studies was performed according to the ECRHS protocol following
the American Thoracic Society guidelines.[31] The maximum FEV1 and maximum forced vital
capacity (FVC) of up to five technically acceptable manoeuvres were determined. Annual
decline in FEV1 (ΔFEV1/yr.) was calculated by subtracting the baseline from the follow-up
value and dividing the difference by the individual time of follow-up in years, a negative value
representing a decline. SAPALDIA used identical spirometry devices (model 2200, SensorMe-
dics Corp., Yorba Linda, CA, USA) and protocols in both examinations,[32] as did ECRHS
centres using same or comparable spirometers (Spiro Medics; Biomedin).[21]
Covariates
Asthma status: Participants reported doctor diagnosed asthma and age of onset. Childhood
and teenage asthma was defined based on the age of reported first asthma attack (<10 yrs. of

3 / 14
 age, respectively <20 yrs.). Adult asthma was defined as having the first asthma attack after the
age of 20 yrs.
Other: Socio-demographic, individual, lifestyle factors associated with respiratory health
and family predisposition, such as parental and sibling asthma, were considered as confound-
ers. Smoking status was defined on self-reported smoking history. Pack years at the 2nd survey
were calculated based on an estimation of the average number of cigarettes smoked per year.
Missing data for pack years (N = 225) and maternal age at birth (N = 237) were imputed by a
“simple” imputation technique based on multivariate regression models to predict the missing
information. Imputed data were only used as confounders in multivariate analyses.
Statistical methods
Descriptive analyses, including comparative lung function (FEV1) at first survey and lung func-
tion decline (ΔFEV1/yr.), were ran by European region and by smoking status. We studied the
impact of early life factors on lung function decline in a mixed-effects linear regression model;
in a first step, for single early life factors (S1 Table), and secondly, adjusting mutually for all
early life exposures. Model adjustments were made for mid age, mid age square, mid BMI (mid
= [survey 1 + survey 2]/2), change in BMI (between survey 1 and 2), height, pack years smoked,
age at highest education, based on the significance level of p�0.2. Different regional adjust-
ments, including the four European regions (main analyses), the cohorts (ECRHS, SAPALDIA)
or study centre as random factors, were performed. To investigate independency of the investi-
gated early life factors from childhood & teenage and adult asthma, we ran additional models
adjusting for the reported asthma status, as well as sensitivity analyses excluding subjects who
reported 1.) asthma as a child (<10 yrs.) 2.) ever having had asthma, 3.) COPD, defined as pre-
bronchodilator FEV1/FVC <0.70 [33]. The potentially increased susceptibility to adult smok-
ing was investigated by interaction terms between significant adverse early life factors and par-
ticipants’ current smoking exposure (e.g. smoking�maternal smoking), and by stratified
analyses by smoking status and sex. Significance of interaction was assumed at a p-value of
�0.1. Furthermore, we ran a sensitivity analysis excluding participants under 25 yrs. at the first
survey and stratified analyses by gender, smoking status and European region. To take regional
differences in population size into account we performed meta-analyses by European region.
All analyses were conducted using STATA 12 (www.stata.com/stata12). The final significance
level was p = 0.05 for all results.
Results
Characteristics of the 12862 study participants by European region are provided in table 1. The
early life factors, except season of birth (p = 0.7), differed significantly between the regions
(p<0.001, Table 1). Age-and height-adjusted lung function and lung function decline is pre-
sented in table 2. In both men and women FEV1 decline was higher in the Northern European
region and among current smokers (Table 2).
The associations of early life factors with adult FEV1 decline, analysed with mixed-effects
linear regression analyses and mutual adjustment for all the early life factors, are presented in
Table 3. The lung function decline was significantly more rapid in participants who were born
during the winter season, to mothers >31 years at delivery, with �2 younger siblings or
exposed to maternal smoking. Significantly less rapid lung function decline was observed in
persons who had attended day care in childhood and was indicated for early life pet exposure
(Table 3).
Sensitivity analyses excluding asthmatic participants (S4 Table) and adjusting for reported
asthma at any age (S5 Table) showed consistent results.

 Analyses stratified by sex yielded consistent results in men and women, with the exception
of parental smoking and respiratory infections (S2 Table, S2 Fig): Differential effects were
observed for maternal smoking by sex, with higher effect estimates in men (ΔFEV1/yr. -2.23 ml
[-5.11 to -0.33]) than in women (-0.57 ml [-2.34 to 1.20], pheterogeity = 0.08). In non-smokers,
respiratory infections were more strongly associated with FEV1 decline in men (pheterogeity =
0.053). Separate analysis for synergistic effects between adverse early life factors and adult
smoking showed that maternal smoking and higher maternal age were more strongly associ-
ated with FEV1 decline among current smokers than among never-smokers (S3 Table). In par-
ticipants exposed to both early life factors we observed a significantly larger effect estimates
compared to a single exposure (Table 4). The synergistic effects were larger in men than in
women (higher maternal age & smoking -4.45 ml [-7.04 to -1.85] vs. (-3.98 ml [-6.80 to -1.14];
maternal smoking& smoking -5.87 [-10.01 to -1.7] vs. -3.17 [-6.39 to -0.08]). Further stratified
analyses by sex yielded a significant interaction between maternal age and current smoking sta-
tus among men (pinteraction = 0.023) but not in women. Synergistic effects were not observed for
season of birth or younger siblings.

 Meta-analyses showed that the associations of early life factors with FEV1 decline were gen-
erally consistent across European regions (adjusted for study centres within each region) (Fig
1, S2 Fig). Only the association with urban living environment showed a significant heteroge-
neity, with protective effects in Central Europe whereas adverse effects were present in Western
and Southern Europe (heterogeneity p-value 0.016, Fig 1).

 Discussion
In two European multi-centre cohort studies, including 12862 persons aged 28–73 at follow-up
and relying on comparable methodology, we found that early life factors predicted lung func-
tion decline into old age, suggesting that lung ageing is programmed early in life. Our analyses
show a substantial impact on lung function decline by early life factors, ranging from adverse
effects almost as large as the effects of personal smoking, to “protective” effects of similar mag-
nitude for having older siblings. The early life impact was independent of participant’s lifetime
asthma status. A more rapid lung function decline was associated with season of birth, higher
maternal age at delivery, maternal smoking and the presence of younger siblings, whereas early
day-care attendance, older siblings and childhood pet keeping appeared to be associated with a
less rapid decline. One must consider, that these early life factors may reflect underlying mech-
anisms, [34] having led to or potentiated the observed lung function decline. The main findings
were consistent across European regions with the exception of urban living environment.
There was some evidence of a differential impact of early life factors by sex, suggesting that
early life programming may be related to gender. Accelerated decline related to adverse early
life factors was more pronounced among current smokers than never-smokers, possibly point-
ing to an increased susceptibility to smoking in subjects exposed to higher maternal age and
maternal smoking.
This is the first study to investigate early life impact on lung function decline into old age,
and to address the hypothesis on interaction with adult insults like smoking. Our findings
agree with some of the earlier studies showing association between early life environment, e.g.
maternal smoking, and lung function decline in younger adults.[6, 21, 26, 27]. We did not
observe a significant effect for respiratory disease on lung function decline, neither did Svanes
et al.[21] or Marossy et al.,[25] although early infections have been associated with lung growth
and function.[15] In our study, non-differential misclassification by retrospective recall or dif-
ferent severity of childhood disease may explain the null-finding. Such imprecision would
most likely attenuate the true association.

 Among the novel findings is the association of lung function decline with season of birth.
This association was strong and consistent between European regions. Participants born in
winter months had a more rapid decline in lung function. Being born in winter has been related
to in-utero exposures to viral infections or allergens and to a higher frequency of respiratory

 infections in the first months of life,[35] both likely major influences on the subsequent estab-
lishment of immune response.[36] Low maternal vitamin D levels, more frequent in winter sea-
son, have also been discussed as possible factor influencing childhood wheeze and asthma.[37]
Season of birth cannot be separated, however, from season of conception and pregnancy. Our
finding that season of birth is somehow related to early life programming of lung ageing should
fuel further research into underlying mechanisms.
We found a more pronounced lung function decline in participants born to older mothers.
Maternal age at delivery reflects biological ageing of the mother as well as sociocultural charac-
teristics. Pregnancy complications [38] and Caesarean section are more common in older
mothers, and may be of importance for immunological functions in infants [39] and beyond
[40]. A birth cohort effect may also play a role, as participants born between 1930 and 1950
were more often born to older mothers than younger participants (data not shown). Our result
conflict with earlier publications,[41, 42] but are in line with a recent study by Caudri et al.
observing a differential impact of maternal age depending on the wheeze phenotypes, implying
older age to be associated with late onset wheeze. [43] We also observed that maternal smoking
is a significant predictor for accelerated lung function decline even in older age. Long-term
impact of maternal smoking have previously been shown with regard to asthma [5] and lung
function in young to mid-age adults.[21, 26, 27] Inflammatory pathways are believed to be cen-
tral; however, many open questions remain regarding the underlying mechanisms.[26, 34] In
our cohorts lung function decline was more pronounced in smokers who in addition were
exposed to either maternal smoking or higher maternal age. This indicates that susceptibility to
later adult insults might be programmed early in life. A synergistic effect of parental smoking
has been described by Guerra et al. [26] who found a steeper decline of lung function in young
adults exposed to both parental and individual smoking. Upton et al. showed that the effect on
airflow limitation by 10 cigarettes/day maternal smoking was numerically equivalent to 10
years active smoking. [27] The importance of the early life environment for susceptibility to
adult insults has already been discussed by Ramsey et al., who found an additive influence on
FEV1 decline by parental and individual socio-economic position. Previous findings on syner-
gistic effects support our novel finding on an increased susceptibility to smoking in subjects
born to older mothers. Our data further support some heterogeneity by gender: we found a
stronger overall impact of maternal age and current smoking in men as compared to women,
even after adjustment for pack years. There are several known mechanisms which may explain
different susceptibility by sex to life-time exposures, [13, 44, 45] and several studies have
shown a higher respiratory vulnerability in men. [5, 46–48] The concept of increased vulnera-
bility at certain time-points in life is also underlying the analyses of both older and younger sib-
lings, representing an early and a later prolonged exposure to a variety of microbes. While the
effect of older siblings was non-significant, we found an independent and adverse effect of the
presence of younger siblings. The analytic approach and the result is supported by a publica-
tion by Svanes et al. that found a U-shaped association between number of siblings and adult
asthma,[23] and a recent publication by Grabenhenrich et al. also observing a U-form associa-
tion between asthma and age at entering day care.[42]
Day care attendance was related to less rapid lung function decline, independent of gender
or smoking status, and similar “protective effects” were indicated for childhood pet keeping
and having older siblings. This is the first analysis of lung function decline in relation to these
early life exposures. Our findings are in agreement with previous research in younger popula-
tions and other respiratory health outcomes, in particular allergic diseases.[49] The data imply
that these factors, generally discussed in view of the hygiene hypothesis,[50] can induce long-
term modifications of the immune system.

 While a study within ECRHS showed that some childhood exposures are reported with high
consistency, irrespective of respiratory health status,[51] residual confounding due to recall
bias cannot be excluded. All factors except maternal age were recorded at baseline, prior to
measurement of lung function at baseline and at follow-up. The retrospective reporting of
these factors might have led to imprecise recall, which is likely to have attenuated true associa-
tions. It is, however, unlikely that recall would be differential with regard to the outcome of the
present analysis—the difference between two objectively measured lung function values. It is
also unlikely that recall bias should be uniform across different cohorts and European
countries.
The consistent results across European regions suggest that the associations may be due to
homogeneous biological mechanisms rather than heterogeneous socio-cultural differences.
Heterogeneity between regions was only found for the impact of urban living environment. We
observed a significant protective effect on lung function decline by urbanity in Central Europe,
while the opposite was found in Western and Southern Europe. Urbanity can be considered a
proxy for opposite health determinants, e.g. higher pollutant exposure versus better access to
health care. Our data did not allow investigating the latent construct urbanity any further.
With respect to parental smoking, we could not assess how much parents have smoked and
for how long. This limitation possibly reduced the power of our study, since one would assume
that the synergy would increase with higher doses of exposure in childhood.[27] Residual con-
founding is also possible due to a lack of information on further potentially influencing factors
e.g. nutrition, air pollution exposure in childhood or birth characteristics. Individuals with par-
ticularly poor early life development could possibly be more or less likely to participate in the
cohort, thus, the prevalence of early life factors might not reflect the true population preva-
lence. In view of our study hypothesis, this bias would limit the generalizability of our study,
but not produce spurious associations. As some study participants were younger than 25 years
at the first survey, late lung growth may have confounded the analyses. However, excluding
these subjects resulted in consistent associations. The analytical strategy, including all factors
in mutually adjusted analyses, may have introduced over-adjustment, potentially reducing the
power to identify less strong direct associations.
Investigating early life factors and potential interactions demands large study populations,
which was achieved by combining the cohorts SAPALDIA and ECRHS. We had the power to
study even potentially small effects of early life factors and to identify sub-groups at risk, given
the inclusion of persons in the 7th decade with the advantage of rich information about declin-
ing lung function in this aging cohort. This multinational study population constitutes both
strengths and limitations. On one hand, our homogenous results across the European regions
underline the importance of early life environment in Europe. On the other hand regional dif-
ferences in the effects of childhood factors may attenuate the overall effects when adjusted for
regions and regional specific risks may not have been picked up. The results cannot be general-
ized to countries where the investigated childhood factors, such as day care, must be considered
proxies of considerably different exposures.
In conclusion, our results showed that lung function decline into old age were predicted by
early life factors. This novel finding supports the hypothesis that lung ageing, which is captured
by lung function decline, is programmed early in life. We further found that lung function
decline was more rapid in those with early life disadvantages who subsequently smoked, sug-
gesting that altered individual susceptibility to adult insults could be one possible pathway for
persisting effects of early life factors decades later. Interestingly, lung function was found to
decline more rapidly in people born during the winter season, consistently across European
regions; this effect merits further investigation. From a public health point of view, early life
impact on lung function decline and on susceptibility to adult exposures offers possibilities for

accelerated lung function decline.
