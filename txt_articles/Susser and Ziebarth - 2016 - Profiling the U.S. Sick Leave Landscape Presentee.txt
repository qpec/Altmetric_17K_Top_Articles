 Profiling the U.S. Sick Leave Landscape:
Presenteeism among Females
Philip Susser and Nicolas R. Ziebarth
Objective. To profile the sick leave landscape in the United States.
Data Sources. The 2011 Leave Supplement of the American Time Use Survey.
Study Design. Bivariate and multivariate analyses to identify (i) employees without
sick pay coverage and (ii) employees who attend work sick.
Principal Findings. Sixty-five percent of full-time employees have sick pay coverage.
Coverage rates are below 20 percent for employees with hourly wages below $10, part-
time employees, and employees in the hospitality and leisure industry.
Conclusion. Each week, up to 3 million U.S. employees go to work sick. Females,
low-income earners, and those aged 25 to 34 years have a significantly elevated risk of
presenteeism behavior.
Key Words. Paid sick leave, sick pay, presenteeism, low-income worker, U.S. sick

The United States is the only industrialized country without universal access
to paid sick leave (Heymann et al. 2010; Schliwen et al. 2011). However,
underscored by the epigraph, support for paid sick leave has grown substan-
tially in the last decade. Sick leave mandates have been implemented in San
Francisco, Seattle, Washington D.C., New York City and Portland, among
others. Connecticut was the first state to implement an employer mandate
in 2012 (Ahn and Yelowitz 2015); California, Massachusetts, and Oregon
have followed. The Healthy Families Act even proposes the introduction of a
federal paid sick leave program.
A strong rationale for sick pay coverage is public health promotion.

 “negative externalities” and spreads diseases. Given vaccination rates of
around 40 percent in the United States, workplace presenteeism is one impor-
tant channel through which flu epidemics spread (Blank, Schwenkglenks, and
Szucs 2009; CDC 2014a). It has also been found that the costs of reduced work
productivity due to presenteeism can exceed the medical costs for some condi-
tions (Goetzel et al. 2004). Over-the-counter (OTC) drugs that suppress flu
symptoms, but fail to curb contagiousness, reinforce the spread of diseases
under presenteeism (Earn, Andrews, and Bolker 2014). The annual death toll
associated with the flu ranges from 3,000 to 49,000 individuals in the United
States (CDC 2014b, WHO 2014). Using 1987 MEPS data and structural mod-
eling techniques, Gilleskie (1998) estimates that a quarter of all employed
males work during an illness episode. Pichler and Ziebarth (2015) show that
the spread of influenza-like diseases decreased by about 5 percent after U.S.
cities mandated employee access to (paid) sick leave.
This paper empirically investigates the sick leave landscape in the Uni-
ted States, exploiting the 2011 Leave Supplement of the American Time Use
Survey (ATUS). Our conceptual framework consists of two main categories of
predictors. The first category includes workplace factors that predict access to
paid sick leave, such as part-time and full-time work, salary, and industry. The
second category includes factors that predict the individual need for sick leave
such as age and whether one has children.
Our findings show that 55 percent of American employees have sick pay
coverage. Large differences by type of work and sociodemographics exist.
Coverage rates are significantly lower for part-time workers, low-income work-
ers, very young employees, and very old employees. The service sector—
where presenteeism is a particular public health concern—reveals very low
coverage rates.
When analyzing the need for paid sick leave, one finds: In a given week
of the year, 4.8 percent of employees actually take sick leave due to own sick-
ness, and 1.6 percent take sick leave due to a relative’s sickness. Two percent
of employees—or about 3 million Americans—self-report that they would
have needed sick leave but did not take it. Half of those who went to work sick
indicated that a lack of coverage was the reason for their presenteeism. When
analyzing the characteristics of these employees, a clear picture emerges:

DATABASE AND EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS
ATUS Leave Supplement 2011
This research uses the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) provided ATUS, a
nationally representative cross-sectional survey with approximately 14,000
participating households every year, which are equally distributed over all
months of the year (BLS 2014; United States Department of Labor 2015).
In 2011, a special “Leave Module” was included in the ATUS. Because
only employed respondents were eligible for the Leave Module, our final sam-
ple consists of 6,354 respondents.1 We use the sample weights provided by the
ATUS throughout the empirical analysis.
Sick Pay Coverage. The first ATUS Leave Supplement question asks employ-
ees whether they receive paid leave (in general) on their main job. Those 61
percent who answer “yes” are then asked specifically whether they could take
paid leave for different reasons, among them “own sickness.” Our first out-
come variable Sick Pay Coverage is one for those 55 percent who self-report that
they are able to take paid leave for their own illness or those of a sick family
member.2 Other surveys indicate similar shares (Lovell 2003; Boots, Martin-
son, and Danziger 2009; CEA 2014; Gault et al. 2014). For example, the
National Compensation Survey, which surveys employers, reports that 61
percent of U.S. employees would be covered by paid sick leave in 2012 (up
from 50 percent in 1992/1993) (Van Giezen, 2013).
In the United States, it is increasingly common that employers offer a
single “convertible” form of paid leave that can either be used as paid vaca-
tion, paid maternity leave, or paid sick leave. Such plans are sometimes called
“consolidated leave plans” or “PTO banks” (Lindemann and Miller 2012).
Because “consolidated leave plans” do not represent sick pay schemes in the
narrow sense,3 Sick Pay Coverage overestimates the true rate of (separate) sick
leave coverage if employees with such plans claim that they can take paid sick
leave. The Leave Supplement explicitly asks respondents whether their
employer would offer (1) a PTO plan and/or (2) paid sick leave separately.
Respondents who answer positive on the former question, negative on the lat-
ter, and still claim that they can take paid leave when sick, represent 15 percent
Profiling the U.S. Sick Leave Landscape
2307
 of all employees. Thus, only around 40 percent have Sick Pay Coverage and also
claim that their employer offers a separate sick leave plan.4
Unmet Need for Paid Sick Leave (“Presenteeism”). The second outcome variable
indicates an unmet need for sick leave. The binary variable is one for
respondents who indicate that, in their main job in the last week, they
would have needed to take sick leave because of own or a relative’s sick-
ness but, in fact, did not take it. In other words, we measure presenteeism
behavior.
Bivariate Comparisons by Type of Job and Sociodemographics

 similar rates. Coverage rates remain near the average of 55 percent until three
children, and sharply drop to 40 percent when the household counts more
than three children.
While only 18.5 percent of part-time workers have sick pay coverage, 65
percent of full-time workers have access. Put differently, 35 percent of all full-
time employees in the United States claim that they cannot take paid leave
when sick.
The next four rows in Table 1 illustrate that coverage rates are around
60 percent for age groups 25–65 but sharply decrease to 21 percent for
employees under the age of 25, and to 37 percent for employees above the age
of 65.
Jobs that pay less than $10 per hour have coverage rates below 20 per-
cent. Access to sick pay sharply increases to 56 percent for hourly wages
between $10 and $20. Employees who earn $20 per hour or more report in
more than 70 percent of all cases that they can take paid sick leave.
Presenteeism. The average presenteeism rate is 2.1 percent. Relative to an esti-
mated 130–140 million employees between 2011 and today (BLS 2015), this
representative rate translates to between 2.7 and 3 million U.S. employees
going to work sick (or not being able to take care of their sick child) in a given
week of the year. Moreover, 4.8 percent of respondents took sick leave
because of own sickness, and 1.6 percent took leave for a sick family member
(numbers not reported in table).5 In addition, 1.3 percent rescheduled their
work hours or work location due to own or a relative’s sickness.6 This yields
an estimated weekly demand for sick leave of 9.8 percent of the workforce.
Column (2) of Table 1 shows that, first, presenteeism is more than twice
as high for female than male employees (2.9 percent vs. 1.3 percent). Second,
the rate more than doubles from 2.2 to 5.2 percent when more than three chil-
dren are in the household. Third, the rate is higher for full-time than part-time
employees (2.5 percent vs. 1.9 percent). Fourth, the rate is highest for age
groups 25–34. Lastly, presenteeism and the hourly wage are negatively associ-
ated.
Reasons for Presenteeism. Table 2 lists the reported reasons for not taking sick
leave despite needing it. Almost one third—or about 1 million Americans
every week—could not afford the loss in income. Almost 7 percent wanted to
save leave and almost 5 percent got denied leave. Another 2 percent reported
Profiling the U.S. Sick Leave Landscape
2309
 that they did not have enough leave. When adding up these categories, 40 per-
cent of all employees with presenteeism behavior indicate a lack of (compre-
hensive) coverage as reasons for not taking sick leave.
The other main reasons for not taking sick leave when needed are a high
workload (20 percent) or being afraid of negative job consequences
(11 percent).
Multivariate Regression Results
Table 3 estimates the determinants of sick pay coverage and presenteeism
behavior using a multivariate parametric regression framework. Each column
is one regression model, where the models only differ by the sets of covariates
included.
Predictors of Sick Pay Coverage. First, one does not observe significant coverage
differences by gender.
Second, the number of children is linked to paid sick leave access. Hav-
ing less than three children in the household is significantly associated with a
higher likelihood of access to paid sick leave. When controlling for the type of
job, the strength of the relationship is cut in half; yet it is still a highly signifi-
cant 8–9 percentage points (ppt) or around 15 percent of the mean (column 2
of Table 3).

Notes. Standard errors are in parentheses. Each column stands for one Linear Probability Model. The results are robust to estimating probit models and
calculating marginal effects. All regression models are weighted using the ATUS-provided leave module weights. The binary dependent variable in the
first two columns indicates whether interviewed employees have access to paid sick leave. The binary dependent variable in the last two columns indi-
cates whether interviewed employees needed to take sick leave but did not do it in the week prior to the interview. All regressions include controls for
the calendar month of the interview. Reference groups are as follows: age 35–65, male, more than three children in household, hourly wage above $30,
part-time work. The findings are robust to excluding those 114 respondents with an hourly wage of more than $200.

 Third, the highly significant negative correlations between young
employees, old employees, and coverage rates decrease strongly when con-
trolling for the type of job, income, and industry. Yet employees below the age
of 25 and above the age of 65 still have 11–12 ppt lower sick pay coverage
rates when controlling for these factors.
Fourth, controlling for sociodemographics and job characteristics, full-
time work is associated with a significant 29 ppt higher coverage probability.
Fifth, hourly wages between $10 and $20 (as compared to wages of more
than $30) are associated with an 11 ppt reduced coverage probability. For jobs
that pay less than $10 an hour, coverage rates decrease even further and are
29 ppt lower as compared to wages above $30.
Finally, in the regression analysis, the industry reference group agricul-
ture has a coverage rate of 29 percent. Nonsignificant coefficients (construc-
tion, leisure and hospitality, other services) thus reflect low coverage rates. As
seen, coverage rates are a significant 23 ppt, 25 ppt, 33 ppt, and 41 ppt higher
in transportation, education and health care, finance, and public administration,
respectively (see Table 3, column 2).
Predictors of Preseenteeism. Even when controlling for the type of job, age, and
present children, employed women are significantly more likely to report pre-
senteeism behavior. The magnitude of the difference with men is huge: the
presenteeism risk for females is more than 70 percent greater than for males.
Also note that the coefficient hardly changes when job characteristics are con-
trolled for, reinforcing that higher needs—not lower access rates (also see
Table 1)—drive the higher presenteeism rates for females. Explanations could
include the “double burden” or “time squeeze” hypothesis according to which
the number of working hours and responsibilities have particularly increased
for females (Leete and Schor 1994; Costa 2000; Bratberg, Dahl, and Risa
2002).
Second, having more than three children in the household strongly and
significantly increases the risk of presenteeism.
Third, and in line with the observation just made, the 25–34 age group
reports significantly more often to work despite having needed sick leave. The
significant children and age group predictors suggest that children both
directly and indirectly increase the need for sick leave through (1) own sick-
ness, and (2) transmission of infectious diseases to parents.
Finally, the hourly wage is significantly related to presenteeism behav-
ior. Employees with a wage of less than $10 and $10–$20 per hour are more
Profiling the U.S. Sick Leave Landscape
2313
 than three times as likely to report presenteeism behavior in the past week—
relative to wages above $30 with a baseline risk of 0.8 percent.
CONCLUSION
This paper describes the sick leave landscape in the United States—the only
industrialized country without universal access to paid sick leave. The overall
coverage rate among U.S. employees is 55 percent. While middle-aged full-
time employees in finance or public administration have relatively high cover-
age rates, they are below 20 percent for part-time and low-income employees.
We estimate the actual demand for paid sick leave—own or those of a
child—to lie at around 10 percent among the U.S. workforce in a given week
of the year. About 6.4 percent take sick leave, paid or unpaid, and others find
ways to rearrange their working hours or location. However, in any given
week of the year, 2 percent of U.S. employees go to work despite being sick.
These up to 3 million U.S. employees who work sick are primarily low-
income females with kids.

NOTES
1. We leave the sample as unrestricted as possible. The first filter question was
answered by 6,602 respondents (71 missings). To keep the sample size stable across
2314
HSR: Health Services Research 51:6, Part I (December 2016)
 models to allow for clean comparisons, we drop an additional 248 (3.8 percent)
respondents with missings on one of the other covariates.
2. In fact, 99.3 percent of those who report that they can take paid leave for a sick fam-
ily member also report that they can take paid leave for their own illness.
3. “Consolidated” paid leave appears to be superior to paid leave under separate cate-
gories. The BLS reports that the average PTO bank has 20 days of total paid leave
after 5 years of service with the employer. It has been argued that employers offer
PTO plans to reduce the overall number of paid leave days (Lindemann and Miller
2012). In addition, PTO plans may not reduce contagious presenteeism in an opti-
mal way because employees are reluctant to use their paid vacation for sickness.
Note that employees are always free to use their paid vacation as personal sick pays
or for any other reason.
4. Eighty-nine respondents not only deny that they have separate sick leave plans, indi-
cate to have a PTO plan, but also deny that they can take paid leave when sick.
While all these statement could be true at the same time, we suspect small reporting
errors among those 89 respondents with a zero on Sick Pay Coverage. The findings are
robust to recoding these 89 respondents.
5. As a comparison, under Germany’s generous mandated sick leave scheme—with
up to 6 weeks of paid sick leave without wage cuts—on a given workday, 4 percent
of the workforce is on sick leave. During the flu season, each day about 1.5 percent
are on sick leave due to colds and flus (Techniker Krankenkasse, 2015). About half
the workforce report zero sick days per year, but, on average, employees take
15 days of paid sick leave (Ziebarth and Karlsson 2010, 2014). The majority of sick
days are due to musculoskeletal diseases—back pain—(20 percent), mental diseases
(18 percent), and respiratory diseases (13 percent), which also include influenza
(Techniker Krankenkasse, 2015).
6. Except for four respondents, no one who rescheduled work reported an unmet need
for sick leave; that is, the reported shares above are all mutually exclusive.
