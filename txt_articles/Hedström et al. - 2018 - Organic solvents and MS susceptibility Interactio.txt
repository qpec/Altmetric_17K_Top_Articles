Abstract
Objective
We hypothesize that different sources of lung irritation may contribute to elicit an immune
reaction in the lungs and subsequently lead to multiple sclerosis (MS) in people with a genetic
susceptibility to the disease. We aimed to investigate the influence of exposure to organic
solvents on MS risk, and a potential interaction between organic solvents and MS risk human
leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes.
Methods
Using a Swedish population-based case-control study (2,042 incident cases of MS and 2,947
controls), participants with different genotypes, smoking habits, and exposures to organic
solvents were compared regarding occurrence of MS, by calculating odds ratios with 95%
confidence intervals using logistic regression. A potential interaction between exposure to
organic solvents and MS risk HLA genes was evaluated by calculating the attributable pro-
portion due to interaction.
Results
Overall, exposure to organic solvents increased the risk of MS (odds ratio 1.5, 95% confidence
interval 1.2–1.8, p = 0.0004). Among both ever and never smokers, an interaction between
organic solvents, carriage of HLA-DRB1*15, and absence of HLA-A*02 was observed with
regard to MS risk, similar to the previously reported gene-environment interaction involving
the same MS risk HLA genes and smoke exposure.
Conclusion
The mechanism linking both smoking and exposure to organic solvents to MS risk may involve
lung inflammation with a proinflammatory profile. Their interaction with MS risk HLA genes
argues for an action of these environmental factors on adaptive immunity, perhaps through
activation of autoaggressive cells resident in the lungs subsequently attacking the CNS.

 Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic immune-mediated dis-
ease of the CNS in which the etiology involves both genetic
and environmental factors. The strongest genetic associations
with MS are located within the human leukocyte antigen
(HLA) complex. The HLA-DRB1*15 allele provides an in-
creased risk of MS with an odds ratio (OR) of approximately 3
whereas the HLA-A*02 allele of the HLA-A locus exerts
a protective effect with an OR of approximately 0.5.1,2 Al-
though predisposing gene variations have a role in disease
development, previous estimations of the heritability may
have been overestimated. Recently published population-
based studies give concordance rates of approximately 17%
for monozygotic twins as opposed to approximately 2% for
dizygotic twins and siblings in general, compared to the
general population in northern Europe with a prevalence of
about 0.2%.3 These data strongly argue for an essential role of
environmental exposures in determining disease risk, and
these are important to define since they are potentially
preventable.
Environmental factors influencing MS risk are Epstein-Barr
virus infection,4 vitamin D status,5 sun exposure habits,6 ad-
olescent obesity,7,8 and smoking.9 The recently described
interaction between smoke exposure10,11 and MS risk HLA
genes indicates that smoke exposure displays a considerably
higher association with MS among participants with a genetic
susceptibility to the disease.
A meta-analysis concluded that exposure to organic solvents,
another source of lung irritation, is a risk factor for developing
autoimmune diseases.12 Based on 15 studies, the OR of MS
among participants exposed to organic solvents was 1.53
(95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03–2.29).
In a Swedish population-based case-control study, we aimed
to investigate the influence of exposure to organic solvents on
MS risk. We also explored a potential interaction between
exposure to organic solvents and the HLA-DRB1*15 and
HLA-A*02 alleles, taking smoking habits into consideration.
Methods
Study design and study participants
This study was based on Epidemiological Investigation of
Multiple Sclerosis, which is a Swedish population-based case-
control study comprising the general population aged 16 to 70
years. Newly diagnosed cases with MS were recruited via 40
neurology units, including all Swedish university hospitals. All
cases were diagnosed by a neurologist according to the
McDonald criteria. Two controls per case were randomly
selected from the national population register (density sam-
pling), frequency matched for the case’s age in 5-year age
strata, sex, and residential area. The study participants were
recruited between April 2005 and December 2013. More
detailed descriptions of study design and methods are given
elsewhere.13
Data collection
Information regarding environmental exposures and lifestyle
factors was collected using a standardized questionnaire.
Completed questionnaires were obtained from 2,325 cases
and 4,948 controls; the response rate was 93% for cases and
73% for controls.
All participants were asked to provide a blood sample. Blood
samples were available from 2,042 cases (88%) and 2,947
controls (59%) who answered the questionnaire.
Standard protocol approvals, registrations,
and patient consents
The study was approved by the regional ethical review board
at Karolinska Institutet. All participants gave their informed
consent to participate in the study.
Data availability statement
Data related to the current article, intended for reasonable
use, is in principle available from Lars Alfredsson, Karolinska
Institutet. However, to be able to share data from the Swedish
cohort, a data transfer agreement needs to be completed be-
tween Karolinska Institutet and the institution requesting to
access the data. This is in accordance with new data protection
legislation in Europe (GDPR [General Data Protection
Regulation]). Anyone interested in obtaining access to the
data from the Swedish cohort can contact Ingrid Kockum
(ingrid.kockum@ki.se) to set up such a data transfer
agreement.
Definition of smoking habits and exposure to
organic solvents
The initial clinical appearance of MS symptoms was used as an
estimate of the disease onset, and the year in which this oc-
curred was defined as the index year. The corresponding
controls were given the same index year.
Participants were asked to provide information on occupa-
tional exposures by stating whether they had been exposed to
a number of specified items including organic solvents,
painting products, and varnish. For those exposed, partic-
ipants were asked to specify during what period or periods
they were exposed (calendar years) and how many hours per
week they were exposed during each period. Participants who

 reported that they had been occupationally exposed to or-
ganic solvents, painting products, and/or varnish before the
index year were defined as exposed to organic solvents.
Information on smoking was collected by asking detailed
questions regarding current and previous smoking habits in-
cluding duration of smoking and average number of cigarettes
smoked per day. Smoking was only considered prior to the
index year. Participants who had smoked before or during the
index year were defined as ever smokers, whereas those who
had never smoked before or during the index year were de-
fined as never smokers.
Genotyping and definition of genetic
risk factors
All participants who donated blood were genotyped for the
HLA-A and HLA-DRB1 alleles as previously described.14
The participants were classified according to carriage of any
HLA-DRB1*15 allele vs no carriage. Absence of HLA-A*02 has
a protective association to MS, and the participants were classi-
fied according to carriage of any HLA-A*02 allele vs no carriage.
Statistical analysis
By means of logistic regression, the occurrence of MS in par-
ticipants who reported exposure to organic solvents was
compared with that of participants who had never been ex-
posed, by calculating ORs with 95% CIs. Trend test for a dose-
response relationship regarding exposure to organic solvents
and risk of MS was performed by using a categorical variable for
duration (5-year intervals) and cumulative dose (<52, 52–104,
and >104 hours of exposure) in logistic regression models.
A possible interaction (super-additive associations) between
carriage of HLA-DRB1*15, absence of HLA-A*02, and ex-
posure to organic solvents, was evaluated by quantification of
departure from additivity of effects. The overall interaction
(i.e., due to all 2- and 3-way interactions) between HLA-
DRB1*15, absence of HLA-A*02, and organic solvents with
regard to MS risk was calculated by comparing the joint effect
of the 3 risk factors to the situation when each one acts sep-
arately, using the total attributable proportion due to in-
teraction (TotAP).15 Furthermore, we investigated a potential
2-way interaction between exposure to organic solvents and
smoking in participants with different genotypes.
Both conditional and unconditional logistic regression was
performed. However, only the results from the unmatched
analyses are presented since these were in close accordance
with those from the matched analyses but had higher pre-
cision in terms of more narrow CIs. All analyses were per-
formed using Statistical Analysis System (SAS) version 9.4
(SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
Confounding factors
All analyses were adjusted for age, sex, residential area, an-
cestry, and, when appropriate, smoking habits. Ancestry was
dichotomized into Swedish vs non-Swedish origin. A partic-
ipant who was born in Sweden, whose parents had not im-
migrated,
was
classified
as
Swedish.
Smoking
was
dichotomized into ever or never smoking.
Other potential confounding factors adjusted for only had
minor influence on the results and were not retained in the
final analyses (appendix e-1, links.lww.com/WNL/A594).16
Results
Our analysis of exposure to organic solvents and MS risk was
based on 2,042 cases and 2,947 controls matched by age, sex,
and residential area. The mean age at MS onset was 34 years
and the median duration from the clinically overt disease
onset to the diagnosis was 1.0 year. Almost all cases were
recruited within 1 year after the diagnosis and the ques-
tionnaires were completed after a median of 2.0 years fol-
lowing the onset of the disease. Characteristics of cases and
controls, by exposure to organic solvents, are presented in
table 1.
A significant association was observed between exposure to
organic solvents and increased risk of developing MS (ad-
justed OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.2–1.8, p = 0.0004). There were
statistically significant trends showing increasing MS risk with
increasing duration of exposure (p = 0.04) and total hours of
exposure (p = 0.001). We calculated the ORs associated with
different combinations of the genetic risk factors carriage of
DRB1*15 and absence of HLA-A*02 in participants with
different exposure to smoking and exposure to organic sol-
vents, compared with unexposed participants without the
genetic risk factors (table 2). Participants exposed to smoking
and organic solvents carrying HLA-DRB1*15 and lacking
HLA-A*02 had a 30-fold increased risk of developing MS
compared with nonexposed participants without the genetic
risk factors (OR 30.3, 95% CI 11.7–78.3) (table 2). The
interactions among carriage of HLA-DRB1*15, absence of
HLA-A*02, smoking habits, and exposure to organic solvents
are illustrated in the figure.
Overall, a significant interaction between exposure to organic
solvents, carriage of HLA-DRB1*15, and absence of HLA-
A*02 was observed with regard to MS risk (TotAP 0.6, 95%
CI 0.3–0.8, after adjusting for the matching factors ancestry
and smoking) (table 3). We also performed the analysis
stratified by smoking, as displayed in appendices e-2 and e-3
(links.lww.com/WNL/A594). There were presence of in-
teraction between organic solvents, carriage of HLA-
DRB1*15, and absence of HLA-A*02 among both never
smokers (TotAP 0.4, 95% CI 0.07–0.7) and smokers (TotAP
0.7, 95% CI 0.4–1.0).
We then analyzed the interaction between organic solvents
and smoking regarding MS risk in relation to different genetic
contexts. Among participants with MS risk HLA genes, there

 was a significant interaction between exposure to organic
solvents and smoking (attributable proportion due to in-
teraction [AP] 0.4, 95% CI 0.2–0.7 among those with either of
the genetic risk factors, and AP 0.7, 95% CI 0.4–1.0 among
those with both genetic risk factors), whereas no significant
interaction was observed among those without increased ge-
netic risk (table 4).
All analyses were adjusted for age, sex, residential area, an-
cestry, and, when appropriate, smoking habits. The analyses
were also adjusted for heredity, educational level, socioeco-
nomic status, snuff use, body mass index at age 20, ultraviolet
radiation exposure habits, supplemental vitamin D intake
during the last 5 years, vitamin D status at inclusion, and
a history of infectious mononucleosis. However, these factors
had only a minor effect on the results and were not kept in the
final analyses.
Discussion
In our study, we calculated the association between exposure
to organic solvents and MS risk, and demonstrated a signifi-
cant interaction between HLA-DRB1*15, absence of HLA-
A*02, and exposure to organic solvents, similar to the
previously reported gene-environment interaction involving
the same MS risk HLA genes and smoke exposure. Since the
basic function of the HLA molecules is to present antigen to
T cells, their interaction with smoking and organic solvent
exposure strongly suggests that these environmental risk
factors mechanistically act on the adaptive immunity.
The previous findings that smoking and exposure to passive
smoking,10,11 but not oral tobacco,17 increase the risk of MS
indicate that it is the lung irritation itself that drives the increased
risk associated with smoke exposure. Smoking causes proin-
flammatory cell activation in the lungs and induces post-
translational modifications of proteins,18–20 which may be
cross-reactive with CNS antigens. Furthermore, in experimental
neuroinflammation, autoaggressive T cells have been shown to
be present and available for triggering in the lungs, and after
assuming migratory properties, they reach the CNS with ensuing
inflammation.21
The interaction between lung irritative agents and HLA genes
with regard to MS risk is consistent with class II allele-specific
recognition of autoantigenic peptides in the lungs, resulting in
organ-specific inflammatory disease depending on preferen-
tial peptide binding by allelic variants of class II molecules.
Expression of A*0201 molecules has been suggested to in-
crease negative selection of CNS autoreactive T cells or
modulate their autoreactivity.22 Absence of A*0201 may thus
result in autoreactive T cells persisting and launching an im-
mune response against the self-antigen.
Class I allele-specific suppression mediated by CD8+ cells
has been demonstrated in experimental autoimmune

 encephalomyelitis.23–25 However, further research on
CD8+ T cells in relation to allelic influences is strongly
warranted.
The mechanism linking both smoking and exposure to or-
ganic solvents to MS risk may thus involve lung inflammation
with a proinflammatory profile. We hypothesize that different
sources of lung irritation may contribute to induce an immune
reaction against modified self-proteins or against potentially
autoaggressive cells resident in the lungs and promote MS
development in people with a genetic susceptibility to the
disease.
There is some evidence that environmental agents enter the
CNS via the olfactory structures. Olfactory bulb and tract
demyelination has been shown to be highly inflammatory and
we cannot rule out the olfactory axis as a route by which
organic solvents and smoking influence the initiation of the
disease.26,27 The gut microbiota has emerged as a potential
factor in MS development, and another mechanism by which
smoking and organic solvents may affect MS risk is through
microbiome alterations.28,29
The study was designed as a case-control study in which
information regarding environmental exposures and smoking
habits was collected retrospectively. We used incident cases of
MS in order to minimize recall bias. The questionnaire con-
tained a large number of questions regarding many potential
environmental risk factors and no section in the questionnaire
was given prime focus.
Organic solvents are liquid organic chemicals used to dissolve
solid materials. It is difficult to analyze different solvents sep-
arately since most of the solvents are a mixture, and most
people cannot specify to what specific agents they have been
exposed. In this study, participants were defined as exposed to
organic solvents if they reported previous exposure to organic
solvents, painting products, and/or varnish. Among those who
reported exposure to organic solvents, there were no differ-
ences regarding professions or line of work between cases and
controls, indicating a similar reporting pattern. Furthermore,
those who reported exposure to organic solvents stated occu-
pational titles/activities that were consistent with those in
which exposure to solvents is most highly probable.
A potential selection bias may arise during the recruitment
process of cases and controls. Since the structure of the
Swedish health care system provides equal free-of-charge ac-
cess to medical services for all citizens, almost all cases of MS
are referred to neurologic units, making them eligible to be

 part of the study. The response rate for participation in the
study was 93% for cases and 73% for controls. Selection bias is
probably modest because the prevalence of lifestyle factors,
such as smoking, among the controls was consistent with that
of the general population.30
Onlycontrolswhohadrespondedtothequestionnairewereasked
to provide a blood sample. There were no significant differences in
age, sex, smoking habits, or exposure to organic solvents between
those who provided blood and those who did not, indicating that
selection bias did not take place in this step. It seems unlikely that
our findings would be affected by bias to a large extent, especially
since such a bias would depend on HLA types.

 genetic risk factors, among women and men, respectively.
However, a significant interaction between the genetic risk
factors and organic solvents was observed among both sexes
when the exposure exceeded 1 hour per week during at least 1
year (AP 0.6, 95% CI 0.01–1.2 among women, and AP 0.6,
95% CI 0.04–1.1 among men). Furthermore, the interaction
between smoking and organic solvents among participants
with both genetic risk factors was similar among women and
men (AP 0.7, 95% CI 0.2–1.3 among women and AP 0.7, 95%
CI 0.2–1.1 among men), whereas no significant interaction
was observed among those without genetic risk factors (AP
0.1, 95% CI 0.8–1.0 among women and AP 0.2, 95% CI
0.6–1.0 among men).
In our study, we calculated the overall interaction (i.e., due
to all 2- and 3-way interactions) between HLA-DRB1*15,
absence of HLA-A*02, and organic solvents with regard to
MS risk, by comparing the joint effect of the 3 risk factors to
the situation when each one acts separately, using the
TotAP. The observed TotAP was 0.6 (95% CI 0.3–0.8) after
adjusting for the matching factors, ancestry, and smoking
(table 3). Part of this interaction consists of the 2-way in-
teraction between HLA-DRB1*15 and absence of HLA-
A*02. For comparison, the AP for the 2-way interaction
between these 2 genetic risk factors was 0.3 (95% CI
0.2–0.4).
We demonstrate a significant interaction between the MS risk
HLA genes and exposure to organic solvents regarding MS risk,
similar to the previously reported gene-environment interaction
involving the same MS risk HLA genes and smoke exposure. We
hypothesize that different sources of lung irritation may con-
tribute to induce an immune reaction against modified self-
proteins induced by lung irritation or against potentially
autoaggressive cells resident in the lungs, and promote MS de-
velopment in people with a genetic susceptibility to the disease.
