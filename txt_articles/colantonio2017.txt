IMPORTANCE High-intensity statins are recommended following myocardial infarction.
However, patients may not continue taking this medication with high adherence.
OBJECTIVE To estimate the proportion of patients filling high-intensity statin prescriptions
following myocardial infarction who continue taking this medication with high adherence and
to analyze factors associated with continuing a high-intensity statin with high adherence after
myocardial infarction.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective cohort study of Medicare patients
following hospitalization for myocardial infarction. Medicare beneficiaries aged 66 to 75 years
(n = 29 932) and older than 75 years (n = 27 956) hospitalized for myocardial infarction
between 2007 and 2012 who filled a high-intensity statin prescription (atorvastatin, 40-80
mg, and rosuvastatin, 20-40 mg) within 30 days of discharge. Beneficiaries had Medicare
fee-for-service coverage including pharmacy benefits.
EXPOSURES Sociodemographic, dual Medicare/Medicaid coverage, comorbidities, not filling
high-intensity statin prescriptions before their myocardial infarction (ie, new users), and
cardiac rehabilitation and outpatient cardiologist visits after discharge.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES High adherence to high-intensity statins at 6 months and 2
years after discharge was defined by a proportion of days covered of at least 80%,
down-titration was defined by switching to a low/moderate-intensity statin with a proportion
of days covered of at least 80%, and low adherence was defined by a proportion of days
covered less than 80% for any statin intensity without discontinuation. Discontinuation was
defined by not having a statin available to take in the last 60 days of each follow-up period.
RESULTS Approximately half of the beneficiaries were women and fourth-fifths were white.
At 6 months and 2 years after discharge among beneficiaries 66 to 75 years of age, 17 633
(58.9%) and 10 308 (41.6%) were taking high-intensity statins with high adherence, 2605
(8.7%) and 3315 (13.4%) down-titrated, 5182 (17.3%) and 4727 (19.1%) had low adherence,
and 3705 (12.4%) and 4648 (18.8%) discontinued their statin, respectively. The proportion
taking high-intensity statins with high adherence increased between 2007 and 2012. African
American patients, Hispanic patients, and new high-intensity statin users were less likely to
take high-intensity statins with high adherence, and those with dual Medicare/Medicaid
coverage and more cardiologist visits after discharge and who participated in cardiac
rehabilitation were more likely to take high-intensity statins with high adherence. Results
were similar among beneficiaries older than 75 years of age.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Many patients filling high-intensity statins following a
myocardial infarction do not continue taking this medication with high adherence for 2 years
postdischarge. Interventions are needed to increase high-intensity statin use and adherence
after myocardial infarction.

T
he2013AmericanCollegeofCardiology/AmericanHeart
Association cholesterol treatment guideline recom-
mends patients aged 75 years or younger with coro-
nary heart disease take high-intensity statins (ie, dosages as-
sociated with a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level
reduction of at least 50% in clinical trials).1 Among patients
older than 75 years of age with coronary heart disease, the
guideline recommends moderate-intensity statins (ie, dos-
agesassociatedwitha30%to50%low-densitylipoproteincho-
lesterol level reduction), with high-intensity statins consid-
ered reasonable for some older patients.1
Adverse effects are more common among people taking
high-vslow/moderate-intensitystatins.2Theaimsofthisanaly-
sis were to estimate the proportion of patients filling high-
intensity statin prescriptions following a myocardial infarc-
tion (MI) hospitalization who continue taking this medication
with high adherence after discharge and investigate factors as-
sociated with continuation of high-intensity statins with high
adherence.
Methods
We analyzed data for 57 898 Medicare beneficiaries aged 66
years or older with an MI hospitalization (defined by an inpa-
tient claim with a code of 410.x0/410.x1 in any diagnosis po-
sition)betweenJanuary1,2007,andDecember31,2012,whose
initial statin fill within 30 days of hospital discharge was for a
high-intensity dosage (eFigure 1 in the Supplement). We ex-
cluded younger beneficiaries because their main reasons for
being Medicare eligible are disability and end-stage renal dis-
ease.Wealsoexcludedbeneficiarieswhoseinitialstatinfillwas
simvastatin, 80 mg, because this formulation is no longer
recommended.3 All beneficiaries had continuous fee-for-
servicecoveragefrom1yearbeforethrough6monthsaftertheir
MI hospitalization. Only the first MI for each beneficiary was
analyzed. The institutional review board at the University of
Alabama at Birmingham approved the study. A waiver of in-
formed consent was granted for the use of deidentified data.
We used Medicare data to identify patient characteristics
andhealthresourceusepriorto,during,andaftertheMI(eTable
1 in the Supplement). Prescription fills for low-, moderate-, and
high-intensity statins were identified using Medicare phar-
macy claims (eTable 2 in the Supplement). Beneficiaries with
and without a high-intensity statin fill in the year prior to their
MI were defined as prevalent and new users, respectively.
We analyzed patterns of statin use at 6 months, 1 year, 18
months,and2yearsaftertheMI,restrictedtobeneficiarieswho
had continuous fee-for-service coverage during these times
(eFigure 2 in the Supplement). Patterns analyzed at 6 months
after discharge included:
• Continuing to take high-intensity statins with high adher-
ence: proportion of days covered of at least 80% for high-
intensity statins without low/moderate-intensity statin pre-
scriptionfillswithin6monthsafterdischargeandwithastatin
available to take in the last 60 days of the 6-month period.
Proportion of days covered was calculated using the interval-
based method, excluding days spent in the hospital.4
• Down-titrating to low/moderate-intensity statins with high
adherence: low/moderate-intensity statin prescription fill
during the 6 months after discharge without subsequent
high-intensity statin prescription fills, proportion of days
covered of at least 80% from the first low/moderate-
intensity statin fill through 6 months after discharge, and a
statin available to take in the last 60 days of the 6-month
period.
• Statin use with low adherence: proportion of days covered
lessthan80%forhigh-orlow/moderate-intensitystatinswith
a statin available to take in the last 60 days of the 6-month
period.
• Discontinuationofstatins:nothavingastatinavailabletotake
in the last 60 days of the 6-month period.

Other patterns of statin use
The group “other patterns of statin use” includes beneficiaries who do not meet
the definition for continuing to take high-intensity statins with high adherence,
down-titrating to low/moderate-intensity statins with high adherence, using
statins with low adherence, or discontinuing statins.
Key Points
Question Do patients take high-intensity statins with high
adherence after a myocardial infarction?
Findings In this cohort study, 41.6% and 39.1% of patients aged
66 to 75 years and older than 75 years, respectively, who filled a
high-intensity statin prescription within 30 days after a myocardial
infarction hospitalization continued taking this medication with
high adherence at 2 years postdischarge.
Meaning A substantial proportion of patients filling high-intensity
statin prescriptions following a myocardial infarction do not
continue taking this medication with high adherence and may
benefit from interventions aimed to improve high-intensity
statin use.

• Other patterns of statin use: not meeting any of the previ-
ously mentioned definitions (eg, down-titration to low/
moderate-intensity statins followed by up-titration back to
a high-intensity statin).
Analogous definitions were used to analyze statin use pat-
terns at 1 year, 18 months, and 2 years.
Beneficiaries aged 66 to 75 years and older than 75 years
were analyzed separately. We calculated patterns of statin use
following hospital discharge in the overall population among
patients with an MI in 2007 and 2012 and among prevalent and
new high-intensity statin users. Also, we calculated patterns
of statin use at 1 year, 18 months, and 2 years postdischarge
restricted to beneficiaries who continued taking high-
intensity statins with high adherence, down-titrated to a low/
moderate-intensity statin with high adherence, took statins
with low adherence, and discontinued their statin at 6 months.

culated prevalence ratios for taking high-intensity statins with
high adherence at 2 years following hospital discharge overall
and conditional on taking a high-intensity statin with high ad-
herence at 6 months. Factors associated with taking high-
intensitystatinswithhighadherencewerealsoanalyzedamong
prevalent and new high-intensity statin users, separately.
Results
Among beneficiaries 66 to 75 years of age, 17 633 (58.9%) con-
tinuedtakingahigh-intensitystatinwithhighadherence,2605
(8.7%) down-titrated to a low/moderate-intensity statin with
high adherence, 5182 (17.3%) had low statin adherence, and
3705 (12.4%) discontinued their statin at 6 months after dis-
charge (Figure 1). Progressively fewer beneficiaries contin-
uedtakingahigh-intensitystatinwithhighadherenceat1year,
18 months, and 2 years. The proportion of beneficiaries tak-
ing high-intensity statins with high adherence after dis-
charge increased between 2007 and 2012 (eFigure 3 in the
Supplement). New high-intensity statin users were less likely
to continue taking high-intensity statins with high adher-
ence vs prevalent users (eFigure 4 in the Supplement). Among
beneficiaries taking high-intensity statins with high adher-
ence at 6 months postdischarge, 9547 (64.0%) continued tak-
ing a high-intensity statin with high adherence at 2 years (eFig-
ure 5 in the Supplement). Few beneficiaries taking statins with
low adherence or who discontinued statin therapy at 6 months
were taking high- or low/moderate-intensity statins with high
adherence at 1 year, 18 months, and 2 years. Results were simi-
lar among beneficiaries older than 75 years of age (eFigures 6-9
in the Supplement).
Characteristics of beneficiaries by their pattern of statin
use at 6 months after discharge is shown in the Table for those
aged 66 to 75 years and eTable 3 in the Supplement for those
older than 75 years. After multivariable adjustment, the prob-
ability of continuing to take a high-intensity statin with high
adherence at 6 months and 2 years after discharge increased
from 2007 to 2012 and was higher among beneficiaries with
dualMedicare/Medicaidcoverage,cardiacrehabilitation,more
cardiologist visits, and a medication coverage gap after dis-
charge (Figure 2; eFigure 10 in the Supplement for beneficia-
ries 66-75 years and older than 75 years, respectively). In con-
trast, African American patients, Hispanic patients, and new
high-intensity statin users were less likely to continue taking
a high-intensity statin with high adherence. Factors associ-
ated with continuing to take a high-intensity statin with high
adherence were consistent for prevalent and new high-
intensity statin users (eFigures 11-14 in the Supplement).
Discussion
In this study, most Medicare beneficiaries who filled a high-
intensitystatinprescriptionfollowinganMIhospitalizationdid
not continue taking this medication with high adherence for 2
years after discharge. Several patient and health resource use
characteristics were associated with continuing high-intensity
statins with high adherence. These factors could inform inter-
ventions to reduce residual cardiovascular risk after MI.
Risk for recurrent coronary heart disease events is high af-
ter an MI.5 However, between 2007 and 2011, less than 30%
of Medicare beneficiaries 65 to 74 years of age filled a high-
intensity statin prescription within 90 days after a coronary
heart disease–related hospitalization.6 Results from this analy-

sis show that many patients who fill a high-intensity statin pre-
scription after an MI do not continue taking this medication
with high adherence. Suboptimal adherence to high-
intensity statins has been reported among patients 18 years of
ageorolderwithcommercialhealthinsuranceorMedicarecov-

sis suggests that African American individuals, Hispanic in-
dividuals,andnewhigh-intensitystatinusersmayhavealarger
benefit from monitoring adherence to high-intensity statins
after MI.
The association between reaching the Medicare medica-
tion coverage gap and high-intensity statin use with high
adherence may be owing to high medication adherence being
associated with greater costs. Dual Medicare/Medicaid cover-
age and postdischarge cardiologist visits and cardiac rehabili-
tation were associated with continuing to take a high-
intensity statin with high adherence. These results are
consistent with prior studies showing that a lower medica-
tion copayment, cardiology visits, and cardiac rehabilitation
are associated with higher statin use.10-13 Full coverage of
medications, including statins, was effective in reducing the
risk for major vascular events or revascularization after an MI
in a cluster-randomized trial.14 In another trial, randomiza-
tion to cardiac rehabilitation vs usual care increased adher-
ence to lipid-lowering medication at 3 months and lowered
cholesterol levels at 6 months following MI hospitalization.15
Limitations
This study has potential limitations. Use of pharmacy claims
may result in misclassification of statin use patterns because
somebeneficiariesmaynottakethemedicationtheyfilledwhile
others may receive free samples. Other factors not considered
in this analysis, including characteristics of the hospital where
thepatientwastreatedfortheirMI,maybeassociatedwithpat-
terns of statin use. Reasons for statin down-titration or discon-
tinuation were not analyzed because these data are not avail-
able in Medicare claims.
Conclusions
Results from this study indicate that many patients who fill a
high-intensitystatinfollowinganMIhospitalizationdonotcon-
tinue taking this medication with high adherence during the 2
years postdischarge. Lower medication costs, cardiologist vis-
its,andcardiacrehabilitationmaycontributetoimprovinghigh-
intensity statin use and adherence after myocardial infarction.
