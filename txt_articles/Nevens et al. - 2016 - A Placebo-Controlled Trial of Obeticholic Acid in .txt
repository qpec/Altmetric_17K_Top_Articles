BACKGROUND
Primary biliary cholangitis (formerly called primary biliary cirrhosis) can progress 
to cirrhosis and death despite ursodiol therapy. Alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin 
levels correlate with the risk of liver transplantation or death. Obeticholic acid, a 
farnesoid X receptor agonist, has shown potential benefit in patients with this disease.
METHODS
In this 12-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial, we randomly as-
signed 217 patients who had an inadequate response to ursodiol or who found the 
side effects of ursodiol unacceptable to receive obeticholic acid at a dose of 10 mg 
(the 10-mg group), obeticholic acid at a dose of 5 mg with adjustment to 10 mg if 
applicable (the 5–10-mg group), or placebo. The primary end point was an alkaline 
phosphatase level of less than 1.67 times the upper limit of the normal range, with 
a reduction of at least 15% from baseline, and a normal total bilirubin level.
RESULTS
Of 216 patients who underwent randomization and received at least one dose of 
obeticholic acid or placebo, 93% received ursodiol as background therapy. The 
primary end point occurred in more patients in the 5–10-mg group (46%) and the 
10-mg group (47%) than in the placebo group (10%; P<0.001 for both comparisons). 
Patients in the 5–10-mg group and those in the 10-mg group had greater decreases 
than those in the placebo group in the alkaline phosphatase level (least-squares 
mean, −113 and −130 U per liter, respectively, vs. −14 U per liter; P<0.001 for both 
comparisons) and total bilirubin level (−0.02 and −0.05 mg per deciliter [−0.3 and 
−0.9 μmol per liter], respectively, vs. 0.12 mg per deciliter [2.0 μmol per liter]; 
P<0.001 for both comparisons). Changes in noninvasive measures of liver fibrosis 
did not differ significantly between either treatment group and the placebo group 
at 12 months. Pruritus was more common with obeticholic acid than with placebo 
(56% of patients in the 5–10-mg group and 68% of those in the 10-mg group vs. 
38% in the placebo group). The rate of serious adverse events was 16% in the 5–10-mg 
group, 11% in the 10-mg group, and 4% in the placebo group.
CONCLUSIONS
Obeticholic acid administered with ursodiol or as monotherapy for 12 months in 
patients with primary biliary cholangitis resulted in decreases from baseline in 
alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin levels that differed significantly from the 
changes observed with placebo. There were more serious adverse events with 
obeticholic acid. (Funded by Intercept Pharmaceuticals; POISE ClinicalTrials.gov

P
rimary biliary cholangitis, former-
ly called primary biliary cirrhosis,1-5 is a rare 
autoimmune liver disease (prevalence of ap-
proximately 20 to 40 cases per 100,000 persons) 
that predominantly affects women.6-8 It is char-
acterized by inflammation and progressive de-
struction of interlobular bile ductules, cholestasis 
that provokes debilitating fatigue and itch, even-
tual cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease, and death.7 
Elevated alkaline phosphatase and γ-glutamyl-
transferase (GGT) levels are early biochemical 
signs of primary biliary cholangitis; the bilirubin 
level increases with advanced disease.7 Higher 
levels of alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin levels 
correlate with disease progression, and lower levels 
are predictive of survival without the need for 
liver transplantation.9,10 In a large, international 
cohort analysis involving patients with primary 
biliary cholangitis, elevations in the alkaline phos-
phatase level were independently associated with 
a risk of liver transplantation or death that was 
2.0 to 2.5 times as high as the risk associated with 
normal levels.10 An abnormally elevated bilirubin 
level, which occurs later in disease progression, 
was a stronger predictor of outcomes, with a risk 
of liver transplantation or death that was 5.1 to 
10.7 times the risk associated with normal levels; 
however, even increased values within the normal 
range were associated with a risk of disease pro-
gression.10
The only approved treatment for primary bili-
ary cholangitis was ursodiol, which decreases liver 
biochemical values and delays the time to liver 
transplantation.7,8 However, an abnormally elevat-
ed level of alkaline phosphatase persists in many 
patients, and mortality is significantly higher 
among these patients than in the general popu-
lation; therefore, there is an unmet need for ad-
ditional therapeutic options for patients with pri-
mary biliary cholangitis.9
Obeticholic acid is a selective farnesoid X re-
ceptor (FXR) agonist that is derived from the bile 
acid chenodeoxycholic acid, the endogenous FXR 
ligand. Obeticholic acid has approximately 100 
times greater potency in activating FXR than 
chenodeoxycholic acid.11 FXR signaling protects 
hepatocytes against bile acid toxicity by impairing 
bile acid synthesis and stimulating choleresis by 
means of up-regulation of bile acid transporters.12 
In addition, FXR regulates other pathways with 
direct antiinflammatory and antifibrotic effects.13-15
In two 12-week phase 2 studies, daily doses of 
up to 50 mg of obeticholic acid resulted in reduc-
tions from baseline in levels of alkaline phospha-
tase and bilirubin that were significantly greater 
than those with placebo.16 However, dose-related 
increases in the incidence and severity of pruri-
tus were evident, particularly at doses of more 
than 10 mg. The aim of our phase 3 trial was to 
assess the longer-term efficacy, safety, and ad-
verse-event profile of obeticholic acid in patients 
with primary biliary cholangitis who were receiv-
ing daily doses of 5 mg or 10 mg.
Methods
Participants
Patients 18 years of age or older who had received 
a diagnosis of primary biliary cholangitis7,8 were 
recruited at 59 sites in 13 countries (see the Sup-
plementary Appendix, available with the full text 
of this article at NEJM.org). Entry criteria were an 
alkaline phosphatase level of at least 1.67 times the 
upper limit of the normal range or an abnormal 
total bilirubin level of less than 2 times the upper 
limit of the normal range. The first patient was 
enrolled in March 2012, and the last patient com-
pleted the double-blind phase in December 2013.
Trial Design
The PBC OCA International Study of Efficacy 
(POISE) was a randomized, double-blind, place-
bo-controlled, parallel-group, 12-month phase 3 
trial. Patients were randomly assigned, in a 1:1:1 
ratio, to receive once-daily oral placebo, obeticho-
lic acid at an initial dose of 5 mg with adjust-
ment to 10 mg if applicable (the 5–10-mg group), 
or obeticholic acid at a dose of 10 mg (the 10-mg 
group), all of which were added to standard-of-
care ursodiol (at a daily dose of 13 to 15 mg per 
kilogram of body weight) or administered alone 
in patients who had unacceptable side effects from 
ursodiol (patients who were not receiving ursodiol 
had to have not received ursodiol for ≥3 months 
before enrollment). Randomization was stratified 
according to Paris 1 risk criteria (an alkaline phos-
phatase level >3 times the upper limit of the nor-
mal range, an aspartate aminotransferase level 
>2 times the upper limit of the normal range, or a 
bilirubin level above the upper limit of the normal 
range)17 and according to the use or nonuse of ur-
sodiol. Patients who were assigned to the 5–10-mg 
group initially received obeticholic acid at a dose of 
5 mg for 6 months, after which time the dose was

increased to 10 mg on the basis of the side-effect 
profile and biochemical response; if patients had 
adverse events such as severe pruritus or had al-
ready met the primary composite end point, their 
dose was not increased. All patients who entered 
the 5-year open-label extension phase after com-
pleting the double-blind phase received obeticholic 
acid at a dose of 5 mg (including those who been 
taking 10 mg in the double-blind phase) for the 
first 3 months, after which time dose could be 
increased.
Trial Oversight
The protocol, available at NEJM.org, was approved 
by appropriate local and national ethics and regu-
latory agencies and was conducted in accordance 
with Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the 
Declaration of Helsinki (Seoul, South Korea, Octo-
ber 2008 amendment). All the patients provided 
written informed consent. Details regarding trial 
oversight and author contributions are provided 
in the Supplementary Appendix. The authors vouch 
for the accuracy and completeness of the data and 
analyses reported and for the fidelity of this report 
to the protocol. Employees of the funder (Intercept 
Pharmaceuticals) assisted with the writing and 
internal review of the manuscript. The funder par-
ticipated in each of the tasks outlined above in 
collaboration with the academic investigators (Sec-
tion 2.1 of the Supplementary Appendix). The fi-
nal decision to submit the manuscript was made 
by the members of the publication steering com-
mittee, which included the last author, who is an 
employee of the funder.
Primary, Secondary, and Exploratory  
End Points
The primary composite end point was an alkaline 
phosphatase level of less than 1.67 times the up-
per limit of the normal range, with a reduction of 
at least 15% from baseline, and a total bilirubin 
level at or below the upper limit of the normal 
range at 12 months. Secondary efficacy end points 
included levels of alkaline phosphatase, GGT, ala-
nine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransfer-
ase, total and conjugated bilirubin, and albumin; 
prothrombin time; international normalized ratio; 
plasma bile acid levels; level of fibroblast growth 
factor 19 (FGF-19), an enterokine released after 
FXR activation; inflammation, as assessed by high-
sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) and tumor ne-
crosis factor α (TNF-α) levels; interleukin-6 level; 
transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) level; liver 
apoptosis, as assessed by the cleaved cytokeratin 
18 level; serum autotaxin level; and noninvasive 
measures of fibrosis, such as transient elastogra-
phy18 and the enhanced liver fibrosis score19 (in-
cluding the components of levels of hyaluronic 
acid, procollagen type III N-terminal peptide 
[P3NP], and tissue inhibitor of metalloprotein-
ase 1 [TIMP-1]). Other secondary end points in-
cluded results of categorical analyses of alkaline 
phosphatase levels and biochemical-response cri-
teria; symptoms, as assessed by the primary bili-
ary cirrhosis–40 (PBC-40) questionnaire (a disease-
specific quality-of-life questionnaire)20; and a 
patient-research questionnaire. For patients who 
had undergone liver biopsy at baseline, a repeat 
biopsy is planned to be performed after 3 years 
of treatment with obeticholic acid.
Additional secondary analyses focused on the 
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of 
obeticholic acid, the effect on the bile acid pool, 
and the effect of bile acid sequestrants (data not 
reported here). Exploratory end points included 
IgA, IgG, IgM, interleukin-12, and interleukin-23 
levels. A genetics study is planned in a subgroup 
of patients after they receive obeticholic acid for 
3 years. Assessments of safety and side effects 
included adverse events, laboratory variables, a 
visual-analogue scale for pruritus,21 the 5-D pru-
ritus questionnaire (measuring the degree, dura-
tion, direction [improvement or worsening], dis-
ability [effect on daily activities], and distribution 
of itching),22 dual energy x-ray absorptiometry 
(DEXA), electrocardiography, physical examina-
tion, and vital signs. A post hoc analysis to assess 
the correlation between the autotaxin level and 
the severity of patient-reported pruritus was also 
performed. Relevant methods and domain ranges 
are summarized in the Supplementary Appendix.
Statistical Analysis
An analysis of the primary end point was performed 
in the phase 2 trial, in which obeticholic acid was 
added to ursodiol therapy16: 9% of the patients in 
the placebo group and 40% of those who were 
assigned to receive 10 mg of obeticholic acid had 
a positive response. We then calculated the sample 
size using more conservative numbers. Assuming 
a rate of response of 14% in the placebo group 
and of 40% in the group that received 10 mg of 
obeticholic acid, on the basis of a two-sided test 
of equality of binomial proportions at an alpha

level of 5%, we calculated that a sample of 60 pa-
tients per group would provide the trial with 90% 
power to detect a significant difference between 
the 10-mg group and the placebo group.
Statistical testing was two-sided and was per-
formed at the 0.05 alpha level. The analyses of 
the composite end point and of response were 
performed with the use of a Cochran–Mantel–
Haenszel test that was stratified according to the 
randomization stratification factors for the in-
tention-to-treat population. Missing values were 
considered in the analyses as nonresponse. For 
the primary end point, multiple comparisons were 
accounted for with the use of a sequential closed 
gatekeeping method; if the P value was less than 
0.05 for the primary comparison between the 
10-mg group and the placebo group, testing of 
the 5–10-mg group would be considered to be 
confirmatory. There was no prespecified plan for 
the adjustment for multiple comparisons in the 
analyses of secondary outcomes.
Results of laboratory tests, transient elastogra-
phy, enhanced liver fibrosis tests, and the PBC-40 
questionnaire were compared between the 
obeticholic acid groups and the placebo group with 
the use of an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) 
model with changes from baseline as the depen-
dent variable, treatment group and randomization 
stratification factors as fixed effects, and baseline 
value as a covariate. Markers of immunity, inflam-
mation, apoptosis, and the FGF-19 level were not 
normally distributed; differences between the trial 
groups were therefore compared with the use of 
a Wilcoxon rank-sum test and Hodges–Lehmann 
estimates of median differences between the treat-
ment groups and the placebo group.
Adverse events were summarized according 
to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA) System Organ Class, the MedDRA pre-
ferred term, severity (as defined in the protocol), 
and causal relationship (as assessed by the indi-
vidual investigators). DEXA scans were obtained at 
baseline and at month 12. Other safety and side-
effect assessments were summarized with the use 
of descriptive statistics at baseline and at each visit. 
The visual-analogue scale and the 5-D question-
naires were analyzed with the use of an ANCOVA 
model, as described above. Details of additional 
statistical analyses and sample-size and power 
calculations are provided in the Supplementary 
Appendix.
Results
Trial Populations
A total of 316 persons were screened for partici-
pation, of whom 217 underwent randomization; 
73 patients were randomly assigned to the place-
bo group, 71 to the group that received obeticho-
lic acid at an initial dose of 5 mg with adjust-
ment to 10 mg if applicable (5–10-mg group), and 
73 to the group that received 10 mg of obeticho-
lic acid (10-mg group) (Fig. S1 and Table S1 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). The intention-to-treat 
population and the safety population included all 
patients who underwent randomization and re-
ceived at least one dose of obeticholic acid or 
placebo (216 patients; 1 patient from the 5–10-mg 
group withdrew).
The trial groups were balanced at baseline. As 
is typical of the demographic characteristics of 
patients with primary biliary cholangitis, 91% of 
the participants were female and 94% were white; 
the mean age of the patients was 56 years (Ta-
ble 1). A total of 93% of the patients took urso-
diol at baseline and throughout the trial. A total 
of 63% of the patients had a history of disease-
related pruritus, and 59% reported pruritus at 
baseline. Approximately 20% of the patients who 
underwent transient elastography had a value that 
was indicative of cirrhosis (≥16.9 kPa).18
Primary End Point
On a background of standard of care, the rate of 
the primary end point was higher in the 5–10-mg 
group (46%) and in the 10-mg group (47%) than 
in the placebo group (10%) at month 12 (P<0.001 
for both comparisons) (Fig. 1). Response to 
obeticholic acid was rapid, with a significant dif-
ference observed between each obeticholic acid 
group and the placebo group by week 2 and at each 
time point thereafter in the double-blind phase 
(P<0.001 for all comparisons) (Fig. 1).
Secondary End Points
The reduction in the alkaline phosphatase level 
was greater in each obeticholic acid group than 
in the placebo group at all visits, with significantly 
greater reductions from baseline at 12 months 
(least-squares mean [±SE] reduction, −113±14 U 
per liter in the 5–10-mg group and −130±15 U per 
liter in the 10-mg group vs. −14±15 U per liter in 
the placebo group; P<0.001 for both comparisons)

Obeticholic Acid in Primary Biliary Cholangitis
(Fig. 2A, and Table S2 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix). In the 5–10-mg group, an incremental 
benefit was observed among patients who had 
dose adjustment from 5 mg to 10 mg at month 6, 
as compared with those who continued taking 
5 mg (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix).
The percentage of patients who had a reduction 
of at least 15% from baseline in the alkaline phos-
phatase level was higher in the 5–10-mg group 
(77%) and in the 10-mg group (77%) than in the 
placebo group (29%) (P<0.001 for both compari-
sons). The total bilirubin level decreased in each 
treatment group, as compared with a progressive 
increase in the placebo group (least-squares mean, 
−0.02±0.04 mg per deciliter [−0.3±0.7 μmol per 
liter] in the 5–10-mg group and −0.05±0.04 mg 
per deciliter [−0.9±0.7 μmol per liter] in the 10-mg 
group vs. 0.12±0.04 mg per deciliter [2.0±0.7 μmol 
per liter] in the placebo group; P<0.001 for both 
comparisons) (Fig. 2B, and Table S2 in the Sup-

The Mayo Risk Score incorporates the patient’s age, total levels of bilirubin and albumin, the prothrombin time, and 
the presence or absence of edema and ascites in order to estimate survival, with lower scores indicating longer survival.  
A score of 1.28 to 7.42 indicates a low risk of death, a score of 7.43 to 8.49 intermediate risk, a score of 8.50 to 9.09 
high risk, and a score of 9.10 to 11.62 highest risk23; for example, a patient with a score of 10.2 has a 50% risk of death 
at 1 year (http://www

Liver stiffness was assessed by means of transient elastography. On the basis of research by Corpechot et al.,18 liver 
stiffness in patients with primary biliary cholangitis is assessed as follows: fibrosis stage F1 is associated with stiffness 
of 7.1 to 8.7 kPA, stage F2 with a stiffness of 8.8 to 10.6 kPA, stage F3 with a stiffness of 10.7 to 16.8 kPA, and stage F4 
with a stiffness of 16.9 kPa or more. Data were missing for 34 patients in the placebo group, for 35 in the 5–10-mg 
group (initial dose of 5 mg, with adjustment to 10 mg, if applicable), and for 41 in the 10-mg group.

lic acid had reductions in liver biochemical mea-
surements even if they did not meet the criteria 
for the primary end point (Fig. S3 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). Both obeticholic acid groups 
had results that were superior to those in the 
placebo group with regard to all previously pub-
lished composite biochemical-response criteria ex-
cept one (total bilirubin level at or below the upper 
limit of the normal range and albumin level at or 
above the lower limit of the normal range)24 (Fig. 
S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). The levels of 
GGT, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate amino-
transferase, and conjugated bilirubin decreased 
from baseline in each obeticholic acid group; in 
each case, the changes with obeticholic acid dif-
fered significantly from the changes with placebo 
(P<0.001 for both comparisons) (Table S2 and 
Fig. S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). There 
were no significant differences between the treat-
ment groups and the placebo group in the differ-
ences in change in the albumin level, prothrom-
bin time, and the international normalized ratio 
from baseline to 12 months (Table S3 in the Sup-
plementary Appendix).
As compared with the changes from baseline 
with placebo, significant decreases from baseline 
in bile acid levels and dose-dependent increases 
from baseline in the FGF-19 level were observed 
in each obeticholic acid group (P<0.01 for all 
comparisons), findings that are consistent with 
FXR activation (Fig. 3). In addition, as compared 
with the changes from baseline with placebo, 
Figure 1. Primary Composite End Point in the Double-Blind and Open-Label Extension Phases, According to Trial 
Group.
The primary composite end point was an alkaline phosphatase level of less than 1.67 times the upper limit of the 
normal range, with a reduction of at least 15% from baseline, and a total bilirubin level at or below the upper limit 
of the normal range. Obeticholic acid was administered with standard-of-care ursodiol or as monotherapy (in pa-
tients who had unacceptable side effects from ursodiol). P values were calculated with the use of the Cochran–
Mantel–Haenszel test, stratified according to the randomization stratification factor. P<0.001 for each obeticholic 
acid group versus placebo at each time point shown during the double-blind phase. All trial groups shown are 
those that were assigned at randomization in the double-blind phase. In the open-label extension phase, most pa-
tients initially received obeticholic acid at a dose of 5 mg; at 3 months, and every 3 months thereafter, patients had 
the option to increase the dose up to 10 mg.

Obeticholic Acid in Primary Biliary Cholangitis
the high-sensitivity CRP level decreased signifi-
cantly from baseline in each obeticholic acid group 
(P<0.01 for both comparisons) and the TNF-α 
level decreased significantly from baseline in the 
10-mg obeticholic acid group (P 
= 
0.006) (Fig. S6 
and Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
The cleaved cytokeratin 18 level decreased sig-
nificantly from baseline in each obeticholic acid 
group, as compared with the change from base-
line in the placebo group (P<0.001 for both 
comparisons). The changes in the levels of inter-
leukin-6 and TGF-β did not differ significantly 
between each treatment group and the placebo 
group. The autotaxin level decreased significantly 
from baseline in the 10-mg group, as compared 
with the change from baseline in the placebo 
group (P 
= 
0.03); the difference with placebo was 
not significant in the 5–10-mg group. Details 
are provided in Table S4 in the Supplementary 
Appendix.
Obeticholic acid did not result in any signifi-
cant abatement in symptoms as measured by the 
PBC-40 questionnaire. Patients in the 10-mg group 
had significantly worse scores than those in the 
placebo group on the itch domain of the PBC-40 
questionnaire during the initial 3 months of the 
trial (P 
= 
0.005 at week 2 and P<0.001 at month 3) 
(Fig. S7 in the Supplementary Appendix). A pa-
tient-research questionnaire that was adminis-
tered at month 12 showed that 85% of the pa-
tients in the placebo group, 87% of those in the 
5–10-mg group, and 92% of those in the 10-mg 
group considered participation in the trial to be 
worthwhile (Table S5 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix).
There were no significant differences in non-
invasive measures of liver fibrosis between either 
treatment group and the placebo group. The 
change from baseline to 12 months in transient 
elastographic findings (as assessed at centers at 
which a FibroScan device was available) and in 
the enhanced liver fibrosis score did not differ 
significantly between either treatment group and 
the placebo group. The changes in the levels of 
hyaluronic acid and TIMP-1 (components of the 
enhanced liver fibrosis score) did not differ sig-
nificantly between either treatment group and the 
placebo group; the P3NP level was significantly 
decreased from baseline at month 12 in the 10-mg 
group, as compared with the changes from base-
line with placebo (P 
= 
0.04). Details are provided 
in Table S6 in the Supplementary Appendix.
Exploratory End Points
The IgM level was elevated at baseline in all groups 
and was reduced to a greater extent in each 
obeticholic acid group than in the placebo group 
(P<0.001 for both comparisons). Reductions from 
baseline in the IgA and IgG levels were greater 
in the 10-mg group than in the placebo group 
(P<0.001 for both comparisons), and the reduc-
tion in the IgG level was greater in the 5–10-mg 
group than in the placebo group (P 
= 
0.02); the 
reduction in the IgA level did not differ signifi-
cantly between the placebo group and the 5–10-mg 
group. The interleukin-12 level decreased sig-
nificantly from baseline, as compared with pla-
cebo, in the 5–10-mg group (P 
= 
0.009) and in the 
10-mg group (P 
= 
0.003). The change in the inter-
leukin-23 level did not differ significantly between 
either treatment group and the placebo group. 
Details are provided in Figure S6 and Table S4 in 
the Supplementary Appendix.
Open-Label Extension
A total of 193 of 198 patients (97%) who com-
pleted the 12-month double-blind phase entered 
the open-label extension. Patients who had re-
ceived obeticholic acid in the double-blind phase 
had sustained reductions in the alkaline phospha-
tase levels and total bilirubin levels, a finding that 
shows a durable response through 2 years of treat-
ment (Fig. 2). Patients in the placebo group who 
initiated treatment with obeticholic acid in the 
open-label extension had similar efficacy to those 
who had received obeticholic acid in the double-
blind phase, including a reversal of previous in-
creases in the total bilirubin level to levels that 
were similar to baseline levels (Fig. 2, and Table S2 
in the Supplementary Appendix).
Safety and Side Effects
A total of 198 of 217 patients (91%) who under-
went randomization completed the double-blind 
phase (Fig. S1 and Table S1 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). Nineteen patients withdrew from the 
double-blind phase; 1 patient (<1%) died from an 
exacerbation of preexisting congestive heart fail-
ure and ischemic heart disease (as determined 
by hospital staff), 8 patients (4%) withdrew be-
cause of pruritus, 6 (3%) withdrew because of 
other adverse events, and 4 (2%) withdrew con-
sent (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Pruritus was the most common adverse event 
that occurred during the double-blind phase across

Obeticholic Acid in Primary Biliary Cholangitis
Autotaxin is the only variable that has so far 
been identified to correlate with the severity of 
cholestatic pruritus.25 However, post hoc analysis 
showed no correlation between autotaxin activity 
and patient-reported measures of pruritus sever-
ity (according to the visual-analogue scale, 5-D 
questionnaire, or PBC-40 itch scores) (Fig. S9 in 
the Supplementary Appendix).
Among patients who reported pruritus during 
the double-blind phase (Table S7 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix), the percentage of patients 
who received an intervention (mostly bile acid 
sequestrants) was similar across groups (range, 
50 to 62%). Discontinuation of treatment owing 
to pruritus occurred in 7 patients (10%) in the 
10-mg group and in 1 (1%) in the 5–10-mg group; 
no patient in the placebo group discontinued the 
trial regimen owing to pruritus.
The incidence of serious adverse events was 
greater in each obeticholic acid group than in the 
placebo group; no single serious adverse event 
occurred in both obeticholic acid groups, and all 
serious adverse events resolved without sequelae 
(Table S8 in the Supplementary Appendix). High-
density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels de-
creased in patients in the two obeticholic acid 
groups but stabilized within the normal range 
and were similar to levels observed in patients in 
the placebo group after 12 months. At week 2, a 
sustained decrease from baseline in the triglyc-
eride level and an increase from baseline in the 
level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol 
were observed, as compared with the changes 
from baseline with placebo (Fig. S10 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). Electrocardiographic 
results were similar in each treatment group and 
the placebo group (Table S9 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix).
Although the rates of bone fracture were 
similar among the trial groups, DEXA revealed a 
smaller decrease in the femoral bone mineral 
density T score in each obeticholic acid group 
than in the placebo group (P<0.05 for both com-
parisons). The z score and the lumbar bone min-
eral density did not differ significantly between 
each treatment group and the placebo group 
(Table S10 in the Supplementary Appendix).
The safety profile that was observed with 
obeticholic acid during the open-label extension 
was similar to that in the double-blind phase 
(Table S8 in the Supplementary Appendix). Ap-
proximately 6 months after entering the open-
label extension, one patient died (the death was 
attributed by hospital staff to sepsis complications 
related to endocarditis associated with a replace-
ment valve). Mild-to-moderate pruritus was the 
most common adverse event in all the groups, 
although among patients who were originally 
randomly assigned to receive obeticholic acid, 
the severity and incidence were both lower in the 
open-label extension than in the double-blind 
phase. Lipid profiles were similar in the 12 month 
open-label extension and the double-blind phase. 
No incremental safety findings were observed 
during the open-label extension.
Discussion
Obeticholic acid that was administered in addi-
tion to ursodiol or as monotherapy in patients 
with primary biliary cholangitis reduced alkaline 
phosphatase and total bilirubin levels, as well as 
most other evaluated markers of cholestasis, 
hepatocellular injury, immunity, inflammation, 
and apoptosis. Almost half the patients in each 
obeticholic acid group, as compared with 10% of 
those in the placebo group, met the criteria for

group with placebo. In Panel B, P = 0.046 for the com-
parison of the 5–10-mg group (initial dose at 5 mg 
with adjustment to 10 mg, if applicable) with placebo 
at month 3, P = 0.008 for the comparison at month 6, 
and P<0.001 for the comparison at month 12; P<0.001 
for the comparison of the 10-mg group with placebo 
at month 6, P = 0.003 for the comparison at month 9, 
and P<0.001 at month 12. To convert total bilirubin 
values to micromoles per liter, multiply by 17.1. P val-
ues for the comparison of each treatment group with 
placebo with respect to the change from baseline were 
obtained with the use of an analysis of covariance 
model, with the baseline value as a covariate and with

the composite primary end point at the end of the 
double-blind phase. In the 5–10-mg group, ap-
proximately half the patients remained at the 5-mg 
dose level throughout the trial, and the remain-
ing patients had doses adjusted to 10 mg after 
6 months. Although the primary end point oc-
curred at the lower dose in some patients, there 
was an incremental benefit observed with adjust-
ment to the higher dose.
Liver biopsies are not routinely conducted to 
assess disease progression in patients with pri-
mary biliary cholangitis; therefore, noninvasive 
assessments of fibrosis were made in this trial 
with the use of transient elastography and en-
hanced liver fibrosis scores. Among the subgroup 
of patients who had transient elastography as-
sessed (43%), obeticholic acid was not associated 
with significant reductions in this noninvasive 
measure of liver fibrosis at 12 months. Similarly, 
changes in the enhanced liver fibrosis scores did 
not differ between either obeticholic acid group 
and the placebo group.
Although obeticholic acid and ursodiol are 
structurally similar, they have distinct but com-
plementary pharmacologic properties. Obeticholic 
acid acts by means of the FXR-mediated transcrip-
tional mechanisms (as shown by the FGF-19 and 
bile acid levels), whereas ursodiol acts mainly 
through post-transcriptional mechanisms.15 Ef-
fective daily doses of ursodiol are 13 to 15 mg 
per kilogram (approximately 1 g per day), which 
makes this drug the primary constituent of the 
bile acid pool during long-term administration. 
In contrast, obeticholic acid is effective at consid-
erably lower doses and constitutes less than 2% of 
the bile acid pool at steady-state concentrations.16
In addition to mediating the anticholestatic 
and antifibrotic effects of obeticholic acid, FXR 
also modulates immune response and inflam-
mation.26 Several immune and inflammatory 
mediators were evaluated in an exploratory man-
ner, and the results showed that treatment with 
obeticholic acid was associated with decreases in 
the levels of IgM (which is classically elevated in 
patients with primary biliary cholangitis),7,8 IgA, 
IgG, interleukin-12,27 TNF-α,28 and high-sensitivity 
CRP, findings that suggest potential disease modi-
fication, although no significant between-group 
differences were observed in the levels of inter-
leukin-6, interleukin-23, or TGF-β.
Pruritus was the most common adverse event 
across all groups in the double-blind phase, with 
a higher incidence reported in the 5–10-mg group 
(56%) and the 10-mg (68%) group than in the pla-
cebo group (38%). Although pruritus is the most 
common symptom in patients with primary bili-
ary cholangitis, neither its incidence nor its sever-

the Double-Blind Phase, According to Trial Group.
The median values of fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF-19) increased (Panel A), 
whereas the mean values for plasma bile acids decreased (Panel B) in the 
two obeticholic acid groups. Error bars in Panel A indicate the interquartile 
range, and those in Panel B standard deviations. For the total plasma bile 
acid levels, data are shown only for patients who were receiving ursodiol.  
P values for the comparison of each treatment group with the placebo 
group with respect to the change from baseline in the FGF-19 level were 
calculated with the use of the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. For the analysis of 
plasma bile acid levels, P values for the within-treatment group compari-
sons are from a paired Student’s t-test.

Obeticholic Acid in Primary Biliary Cholangitis
ity correlates with disease stage.29,30 However, the 
initiation of therapy with obeticholic acid at a 
dose of 5 mg, with adjustment up to 10 mg if 
appropriate, was associated with a lower rate of 
discontinuation owing to pruritus (one patient) 
than was starting at 10 mg (seven patients). The 
mechanism for obeticholic acid–related pruritus 
is unclear; although autotaxin has been shown 
to correlate with cholestatic pruritus,25 there was 
no correlation in this trial. There were no other 
changes in quality of life, as assessed by the 
PBC-40 questionnaire, among patients who were 
treated with obeticholic acid.
Patients with primary biliary cholangitis typ-
ically have hyperlipidemia, with elevated levels of 
HDL cholesterol and LDL cholesterol; this pro-
file is not associated with increased cardiovascu-
lar risk.31 As in previous studies, treatment with 
obeticholic acid was associated with a reduction 
in the HDL cholesterol level. This finding may 
result from increased hepatic scavenger receptor 
B1 expression, which is up-regulated by FXR acti-
vation and stimulates hepatic uptake of cholesterol 
from HDL.32 Treatment with obeticholic acid was 
associated with an initial increase in the LDL 
cholesterol level and persistent decreases in the 
triglyceride level, which remained stable during 
the open-label extension. The long-term signifi-
cance of these findings is unclear.
This trial has several limitations. First, primary 
biliary cholangitis is a chronic liver disease, and 
the results reported here are for only 2 years of 
treatment with obeticholic acid. The focus of the 
trial was therefore limited to surrogate biomark-
ers, imaging, and symptom end points, with no 
statistical power to assess clinical outcomes. 
Second, multiplicity adjustments were made only 
for the primary end point and not for secondary 
or exploratory analyses.
In conclusion, 12 months of obeticholic acid, 
administered either with ursodiol or as mono-
therapy, in patients with primary biliary cholan-
gitis resulted in improvements in the alkaline 
phosphatase level, the total bilirubin level, and 
other biochemical markers of disease. These ef-
fects were sustained for 2 years, and patients who 
crossed over from placebo to obeticholic acid had 
similar improvements after 1 year. Obeticholic 
acid dose-dependently increased the incidence of 
pruritus; the mechanism remains unknown. A

clinical trial registration
The Journal requires investigators to register their clinical trials  
in a public trials registry. The members of the International Committee  
of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) will consider most reports of clinical  
trials for publication only if the trials have been registered.  
Current information on requirements and appropriate registries  
is available at www.icmje.org/faq_clinical.html.
