In Brief
Negative regulation of innate immunity is
critical to maintain homeostasis, but it
can have negative consequences in an
infection context. Guo et al. demonstrate
that NLRX1 sequesters the DNA-sensing
adaptor STING to disrupt STING-TBK1
signaling and inhibit innate immunity to
HIV-1 and DNA viruses. Thus, NLRX1
facilitates virus infection.

SUMMARY
Understanding the negative regulators of antiviral im-
muneresponseswillbecriticalforadvancingimmune-
modulated antiviral strategies. NLRX1, an NLR protein
that negatively regulates innate immunity, was previ-
ously identified in an unbiased siRNA screen as
required for HIV infection. We find that NLRX1 deple-
tion results in impaired nuclear import of HIV-1 DNA
in human monocytic cells. Additionally, NLRX1 was
observed to reduce type-I interferon (IFN-I) and cyto-
kines in response to HIV-1 reverse-transcribed DNA.
NLRX1 sequesters the DNA-sensing adaptor STING
from interaction with TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1),
which is a requisite for IFN-1 induction in response
to DNA. NLRX1-deficient cells generate an amplified
STING-dependent host response to cytosolic DNA,
c-di-GMP, cGAMP, HIV-1, and DNA viruses. Accord-
ingly, Nlrx1�/� mice infected with DNA viruses exhibit
enhanced innate immunity and reduced viral load.
Thus, NLRX1 is a negative regulator of the host innate
immune response to HIV-1 and DNA viruses.
INTRODUCTION
A fundamental question in human immunodeficiency virus 1
(HIV-1) research is why the immune system is unable to contain
the virus. Unlocking this key would provide a significant
advance in the advancement of immune-modulated HIV antivi-
rals and the direct strategies for the development of efficacious
vaccines and adjuvants. HIV-1 is known to utilize host-en-
coded proteins to facilitate its replication. On the other hand,
innate immune response, including type-I interferon (IFN-I) pro-
duction triggered by HIV-1 infection, has been reported to
restrict virus replication and promote systematic inflammation,
although innate immunity can also lead to T cell exhaustion and
CD4 T cell depletion (Doyle et al., 2015). It is of great signifi-
cance to understand the roles of host proteins in viral replica-
tion and innate immune response induction by HIV-1 infection.
One approach to advance our knowledge of these complex is-
sues is the use of unbiased screening to identify pivotal players
in HIV infection (Ko
¨ nig and Stertz, 2015). Previous work from
one of our groups used unbiased RNAi screening to identify
host factors that are important during the early step of HIV
infection that resulted in the promotion of viral infection (Ko
¨ nig
et al., 2008). The present work describes the importance of a
host protein, NLRX1, in promoting HIV infection. Different
innate immune sensors and mechanisms have been identified
for HIV-1 components recognition (Altfeld and Gale, 2015).
Recent advances show that HIV-1 complementary DNA, but
not its genomic RNA, induces IRF3 activation and IFN-I pro-
duction dependent on cyclic GAMP synthase (cGAS)-STING
pathway in human macrophages (Gao et al., 2013). Impor-
tantly, the polyglutamine binding protein 1 (PQBP1) is recently
identified as the coreceptor of reverse-transcribed HIV-1 DNA
and associates with cGAS (Yoh et al., 2015). HIV-1 DNA
triggers cGAS to synthesize cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP), which

 is the activator of adaptor protein STING to induce IRF3 and
NF-kB activation, and, thereafter, innate immune response
(Gao et al., 2013).
The nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich repeat-contain-
ing proteins (also known as NOD-like receptors, NLRs) repre-
sent a large family of innate immune receptors or regulators
that have been primarily associated with inflammasome func-
tion (Guo et al., 2015). However, recently they are shown to
play important roles in modulating IFN-I production through
different mechanisms (Allen, 2014). For example, NLRX1 was
the first NLR found to attenuate IFN-I signaling (Allen et al.,
2011; Moore et al., 2008; Xia et al., 2011). NLRC3 has been
recently identified as an inhibitor of STING function by inter-
fering with STING translocation and STING-TBK1 association
(Zhang et al., 2014). NLRP4 negatively regulates IFN-I signaling
by promoting TBK1 degradation (Cui et al., 2012). Nlrp6 binds
viral RNA via RNA helicase Dhx15 and interacts with MAVS
(mitochondrial antiviral signaling) to induce type-I/III IFNs
(Wang et al., 2015). Although the role of NLRP3 inflammasome
in HIV-infected human monocytes is known to trigger IL-1b
(Chattergoon et al., 2014; Guo et al., 2014), the role of NLRs
in modulating HIV-1-induced IFN-I and HIV-1 infection remains
unexplored.
Host factors required for HIV-1 infection were previously
screened by an unbiased siRNA (small interfering RNA) strategy,
and NLRX1 was identified as one of 295 hits, although its signif-
icance was not highlighted nor studied (Ko
¨ nig et al., 2008).
NLRX1 is unique in that it resides in the mitochondria and medi-
ates a host of functions, including ROS induction (Abdul-Sater
et al., 2010; Tattoli et al., 2008), attenuation of the RIG-I-MAVS
and TRAF-IKK signaling (Allen et al., 2011; Moore et al., 2008;
Xia et al., 2011), and induction of autophagy (Lei et al., 2012).
However, the mechanism by which NLRX1 promotes HIV-1
infection is completely unexplored.
In this study, we validated that NLRX1 is required for HIV-1
infection in multiple cell types, including primary human macro-
phages and dendritic cells. Strikingly, the reduction of HIV-1
infection in NLRX1 depletion cells is due to an impaired nuclear
import of HIV-1 DNA. Furthermore, we found that NLRX1
promotes HIV-1 infection by attenuating reverse-transcribed,
HIV-1-DNA-induced IFN-I, IFN stimulatory genes (ISGs), and
proinflammatory cytokines. Notably, NLRX1 associates with
STING to reduce TBK1 activation. We also extended the nega-
tive regulatory function of NLRX1 to immunity to DNA viruses
such as herpes simplex virus 1(HSV-1) and vaccinia virus
(VACA).
RESULTS
NLRX1 Enhances HIV-1 Infection
A recent report showed that expression of the mitochondrial-
localized NLR, NLRX1, is decreased in HIV-1 patient (Nasi
et al., 2015). From an unbiased siRNA screening for host factors
required for HIV-1 infection described previously (Ko
¨ nig et al.,
2008), we identified NLRX1 as a validated hit (Figure 1A). To
test the function of NLRX1 in HIV-1 infection in more relevant
cell types, an HIV-1-permissive human macrophages cell line,
THP-1, was used. NLRX1 was knocked down in THP-1 by two
different shRNAs (small hairpin RNAs) (Figure 1B, left panel).
Notably, HIV-VSV exhibited reduced infection in THP-1 cells
containing shRNA for NLRX1 over time, compared to cells con-
taining the scrambled shRNA (Figure 1C, left). CRISPR/Cas9
strategy was also used to target NLRX1 by two different single
guide RNAs (sgRNAs) in THP-1 cells (Figure 1B, right panel).
Incongruent with the shRNA strategy, THP-1 cells with attenu-
ated NLRX1 expression showed reduced HIV-1 infection (Fig-
ure 1C, right). In addition to measurement of luciferase activity
for HIV-1 infection, THP-1 cells with attenuated NLRX1 expres-
sion displayed a lower level of HIV-1 Gag protein p55 compared
to control cells (Figures 1D and 1E). Finally, NLRX1 was knocked
down in human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) and
dendritic cells (MDDCs) by two to three different siRNAs (Figures
S1A and 1B, upper panels, available online). HIV-VSV infection
was reduced in human MDMs and MDDCs containing siRNA
for NLRX1 from three to four different donors (Figures S1A and
1B, lower panels). Data pooled from different donors were shown
in Figures 1F and 1G. Importantly, a CCR5/CXCR4 dual-tropic
HIV-1 strain R3A also showed reduced replication in cells with
attenuated NLRX1 expression (Figures 1H and S1C) (Meissner
et al., 2004). To examine the point at which NLRX1 promoted
HIV infection, we identified that NLRX1 deficiency reduced nu-
clear import of HIV-1 DNA as measured by the nuclear-imported
2-LTR circles, but did not affect early, minus-strand transfer and
intermediate stages of HIV-1 reverse transcription (Figure 1I).
Taken together, these data indicate that NLRX1 is a host factor
that enhances HIV-1 infection by increased HIV-1 DNA import,
a process that is partly controlled by ISGs (Kane et al., 2013).
Removal of NLRX1 Enhances Innate Immune Response
to HIV-1 Infection
It was previously shown that NLRX1 functions as a negative
regulator of innate immune response by inhibiting IFN and cyto-
kine responses (Allen et al., 2011; Moore et al., 2008; Xia et al.,
Densitometry analysis was performed for Gag p55 levels shown in (E). SC, scrambled control; sh-1, sh-NLRX1-1; sh-2, sh-NLRX1-2; sg-1, sg-NLRX1-1; sg-2,
sg-NLRX1-2.
(F and G) Knockdown of NLRX1 decreases HIV-1 infection in human primary macrophages (F) and dendritic cells (G). Monocyte-derived macrophage and
monocyte-derived dendritic cells were transfected with scrambled siRNA or siRNA targeting NLRX1 followed by infection with HIV-VSV. HIV-1 infection as
reflected by luciferase activity is shown. Data pooled from three or four different donors.
(H) Same as (C) except that the infection was done by using a CCR5/CXCR4 dual-tropic HIV-1 strain R3A. HIV-1 particle release was quantified by p24 ELISA.
(I) Real-time PCR analysis of HIV-1 reverse transcription and cDNA nuclear import as previously described (Mbisa et al., 2009). THP-1 cells with scrambled or
shRNA or sgRNA targeting NLRX1 were infected with HIV-VSV. At indicated time points, total DNA was extracted and HIV-1 DNA was quantified by amplifying
indicated target sequences.
Data are presented as the mean ± SEM. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001 (Student’s t test). All data are representative of two or three independent
experiments.

 2011). Thus, we tested if NLRX1 inhibits HIV-1-triggered innate
immune response, which may account for reduced HIV-1 infec-
tion. Upon HIV-VSV infection, THP-1 cells with attenuated
NLRX1 expression produced more IFNB mRNA and IFNb
protein than control cells (Figure 2A). MX2, a key ISG that in-
hibits HIV-1 cDNA nuclear import (Kane et al., 2013), was
also increased in NLRX1-deficient THP-1 cells, consistent
with decreased HIV-1 DNA nuclear import in the absence of
NLRX1 (Figure 1I). Mouse cells can be infected with HIV-VSV
to interrogate the relevance of a specific gene. Bone-marrow-
derived macrophages (BMDMs) from Nlrx1�/� mice showed
higher induction of IFNb, proinflammatory cytokine genes Il6
and Rantes, and the IFN-stimulated gene 15 (Isg15) than
wild-type (WT) control cells (Figure 2B). MEFs (mouse embry-
onic fibroblasts) from Nlrx1�/� mice and littermate WT mice
were also subjected to HIV-VSV infection (Gao et al., 2013).
Similarly, enhanced innate immune response was observed in
Nlrx1�/� MEFs over time (Figure 2C). To test whether enhanced
IFN-I alone caused the difference in HIV-1 infection between
WT and NLRX1-deficient cells, antibody against the IFN-a/b
receptor (IFNAR) was used. Anti-IFNAR antibody abolished
the difference in HIV-1 infection of WT and NLRX1-deficient
cells (Figure 2D), suggesting that increased IFN production by
NLRX1-deficient cells accounted for reduced HIV-1 infection.
In addition, THP-1 cells with shRNA for NLRX1 and scrambled
shRNA control were infected with HIV-VSV and cultured in
transwells to allow the diffusion of soluble products across
these wells. As a result, the secretory products in the media
should reach equilibrium in these two wells. In this configura-
tion, WT and NLRX1-deficient cells exhibited comparable levels
of HIV-1 infection, suggesting that the difference in diffusible
secreted factors from WT and NLRX1-deficient cells accounted
for the difference in HIV-1 infection between these two samples
(Figure 2E). We next investigated key signaling innate immune
pathways upon HIV-1 infection. HIV-1 infection is known to
cause phosphorylation of TBK1 and IKKε, which leads to
IRF3 activation (Gao et al., 2013; Yoh et al., 2015). The phos-
phorylation of TBK1, IKKε, and IRF3 was significantly enhanced
in THP-1 cells with attenuated NLRX1 expression relative to
control cells upon HIV-VSV infection, and this is followed by
enhanced STAT1 phosphorylation, which is known to be acti-
vated by IFN-I (Figure 2F). In summary, removal of NLRX1
enhanced anti-HIV-1 innate immune response and signaling
known to affect IFN and cytokine production, and this enhance-
ment accounted for reduced HIV-1 infection.
NLRX1 Inhibits HIV-1 Reverse-Transcript-Induced
Innate Immune Response
Previous reports showed that HIV-1 reverse-transcribed DNA,
but not RNA, induces innate immune response such as
IFN and cytokine responses (Gao et al., 2013; Yan et al.,
2010). We next tested whether NLRX1 inhibits HIV-1-DNA-
induced innate immune response. As described by the previous
papers, an HIV-1 reverse-transcriptase inhibitor, nevirapine, and
an integrase inhibitor, raltegravir, were used to inhibit HIV-VSV
infection in MEFs (Figure S2A). Nevirapine blocks HIV-1 comple-
mentary DNA synthesis, while raltegravir blocks HIV-1 DNA
integration into host genome after HIV-1 complementary DNA
synthesis (Figure S2B). As previous reported in MEFs, nevirapine
abrogated IFNb, Isg15, Il6, and Rantes induction upon HIV-VSV
infection, but raltegravir had no effect. Interestingly, enhanced
IFNb, Isg15, Il6, and Rantes induction from HIV-VSV-infected
Nlrx1�/� MEFs was also abrogated when cells were treated
with nevirapine, while raltegravir had no effect (Figures S2C–
S2F). These data indicate that NLRX1 inhibits HIV-1 reverse-
transcribed DNA-induced innate immune response to promote
HIV-1 infection.
NLRX1 Inhibits STING-Dependent DNA-Sensing
Pathway
In HIV-1 infected cells, PQBP1/cGAS recognizes HIV-1 DNA and
generates cyclic GAMP to activate STING (Gao et al., 2013; Yoh
et al., 2015). To investigate the role of NLRX1 in STING-depen-
dent innate immune signal transduction, we first examined the
impact of NLRX1 on STING-induced activation of IFN-stimulated
responsive element (ISRE)-luciferase reporter, which is known to
be activated by STING, TBK1, and IRF3 (Ishikawa and Barber,
2008; Zhong et al., 2008). NLRX1 dramatically reduced ISRE
activation by STING, but not downstream molecules TBK1 and
IRF3, suggesting that NLRX1 interferes with STING function (Fig-
ures 3A–3C). Even though we previously found that NLRC3 in-
hibited STING signaling (Zhang et al., 2014), this has not been
a common feature among NLRs, as several different NLRs,
including NLRP3, NLRP11, NLRC5, and NOD2, did not reduce
STING-induced ISRE activation (Figure 3D). STING can be acti-
vated by cytosolic DNA and cyclic dinucleotides (Burdette et al.,
Figure 2. Removal of NLRX1 Enhances Innate Immune Response upon HIV-1 Infection
(A) THP-1 cells with shNLRX1 or scrambled control shRNA were infected with HIV-VSV (MOI = 1), and the induction of IFNb was determined over time. IFNB1 and
MX2 mRNA levels were determined by qPCR 18 hr postinfection.
(B) WT or Nlrx1�/� BMDM was infected with HIV-VSV (MOI = 1) at different time points. IFNb was measured by ELISA, and Il6, Isg15, and Rantes were measured
by qPCR.
(C) WT or Nlrx1�/� MEF was infected with HIV-VSV (MOI = 1) at different time points. Ifnb was measured by qPCR and ELISA, and Il6, Tnf, Isg15, and Rantes were
measured by qPCR.
(D) THP-1 cells with shNLRX1 or scrambled control shRNA were infected with HIV-VSV (MOI = 1) in the presence of anti-IFNR1 or control IgG. At 72 hr post-
infection, luciferase activity (normalized by total protein) was determined to measure virus infection (left panel). Luciferase data were normalized by setting
scrambled control as 1 (right panel).
(E) THP-1 cells with shNLRX1 (X1 KD) or scrambled control (Scr) shRNA were infected with HIV-VSV (MOI = 1) and seeded in the plate with transwell as indicated,
and luciferase activity from upper and lower wells was determined for virus infection 72 hr postinfection. Luciferase activity was normalized by total protein.
(F) THP-1 cells with shNLRX1 or scrambled control shRNA were infected with HIV-VSV (MOI = 1). One day after infection, cells were collected and p-TBK1,
p-IKKε, p-IRF3, p-STAT1, TBK-1, IKKε, IRF3, STAT1, and STING were determined by western blot. GAPDH was used as the loading control.

 2011; Ouyang et al., 2012; Sun et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2013;
Zhang et al., 2013); thus, we evaluated the role of NLRX1 in
cytosolic-DNA- and cyclic-dinucleotide-induced innate immune
signaling. Upon intracellular delivery of IFN stimulatory DNA (ISD)
(Stetson and Medzhitov, 2006), cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP), or
cGAMP, Nlrx1�/� MEFs exhibited enhanced induction of Ifnb,
Il6, and Tnf when compared to control MEFs (Figure 3E–3G).
Phosphorylation of TBK1 is required for STING-dependent IFN
and proinflammatory cytokine production. Consistent with the
cytokine induction data, cGAMP induced greater phosphoryla-
tion of TBK1 with more rapid kinetics in Nlrx1�/� than in control
MEFs (Figure 3H). The effect of NLRX1 was further studied in
BMDM and peritoneal macrophage. Intracellular delivery of
ISD or another commonly used DNA stimulus for STING,
VACV 70-mer (Unterholzner et al., 2010), induced more IFNb in
Nlrx1�/� BMDMs than controls (Figure 3I). cGAMP also induced
more IFNb cytokine and Ifna4 mRNA in Nlrx1�/� BMDMs (Fig-
ure 3I). Similarly, in peritoneal macrophages, intracellular ISD,
VACV 70-mer, or c-di-GMP induced more IFNb in Nlrx1�/� cells
than controls (Figure 3J). Taken together, these data indicate
that NLRX1 attenuates STING-dependent innate signaling
pathway.
NLRX1 Associates with STING to Disrupt STING-TBK1
Interaction
To explore the mechanism by which NLRX1 interferes with
STING-dependent
pathway,
we
tested
the
interaction
of
NLRX1 with STING as a mechanism by which NLRX1 inhibited
STING function. In an overexpression system, bidirectional
coimmunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG or anti-HA beads was
followed by immunoblot to show that FLAG-NLRX1 associated
with HA-STING (Figure 4A, left panel). As a specificity control,
NLRX1 did not interact with cGAS (Figure S3). Recruitment of
TBK1 to STING is a critical step that is required for IRF3 activation
and the induction of IFN and cytokines. Overexpressed FLAG-
TBK1 and HA-STING also showed interaction as expected
(Figure 4A, right panel), which made it possible to test if NLRX1
interfered with STING-TBK1 association in a later experiment.
Since overexpressed protein interaction analysis could produce
artifacts, we tested the association of endogenous NLRX1 with
STING. NLRX1-STING association was detected by immuno-
precipitation using anti-NLRX1 antibody in THP-1 cells and
immunoblotting with the reciprocal anti-STING antibody. Asso-
ciation was detected in controls cells, but not in cells where
NLRX1 was eliminated with sg-NLRX1 (Figure 4B, left). Recip-
rocal immunoprecipitation with anti-STING antibody followed
by immunoblotting with anti-NLRX1 also confirmed endoge-
nous NLRX1-STING association (Figure 4B, right). Endogenous
NLRX1-STING association was also detected by immunopre-
cipitation using anti-NLRX1 antibody in MEF (Figure 4C). This
NLRX1-STING association was increased during HSV-1 infec-
tion of THP-1-derived macrophages and BMDMs (Figure S4).
Furthermore, we also determined that the association between
NLRX1 and STING is direct by reciprocal pull-down assay using
recombinant full-length NLRX1 prepared from insect cells and
truncated STING protein (amino acid 139–379 and 139–344)
used previously (Figures S5A, 4D, and 4E) (Zhang et al., 2014).
To rule out the possibility that NLRX1 associates with STING
nonspecifically, we showed that recombinant ASC prepared
similarly to NLRX1 did not interact with recombinant STING (Fig-
ure S5B). To better understand how NLRX1 interacted with
STING, we mapped the domains of NLRX1 required for this inter-
action. The results showed that constructs containing NBD alone
or NBD in combination with other domains interacted with
STING. Constructs lacking the X (NBD + LRR) or LRR (X +
NBD) domain also interacted with STING, while construct encod-
ing LRR alone did not interact, suggesting that NBD is the key
domain of NLRX1 that associated with STING (Figure 4F).
Another approach to examine for NLRX1 interaction with STING
is by microscopy. The antibody for NLRX1 was found to be
unsuitable for immunofluorescence analysis; thus, we overex-
pressed FLAG-NLRX1 and HA-STING to assess their colocaliza-
tion. Previous reports showed that NLRX1 is a mitochondrial
membrane protein and STING mainly localizes to the endo-
plasmic reticulum (ER). We reinvestigated the localization of
NLRX1 and found by proteinase K digestion that NLRX1 showed
a protease-sensitivity pattern that is consistent with its localiza-
tion to the mitochondrial outer membrane, but not in mitochon-
drial matrix in HEK293T cells (Figure S6). Colocalization of
NLRX1 and STING was observed by confocal microscopy, which
could occur on the mitochondria-associated membrane (MAM)
(Figure 4G). We performed coimmunoprecipitation by using iso-
lated MAMs prepared as described and confirmed that NLRX1
and STING interacted within this fraction (Figures S7 and 4H)
(Zhang et al., 2011). Finally, we assessed if NLRX1 could interfere
with STING-TBK1 interaction by assaying for STING-TBK1 inter-
action in the presence of increasing quantities of NLRX1.
Increasing NLRX1 reduced STING-TBK1 association in a dose-
dependent fashion (Figure 4I). These data suggest that NLRX1
associates with STING to disrupt STING-TBK1 interaction, thus
providing a mechanism by which NLRX1 inhibits STING-depen-
dent DNA sensing.

 NLRX1 Deficiency Causes Enhanced Innate Immune
Response to DNA Viral Infection
We next investigated the broader role of NLRX1 during DNA viral
infection. We infected Nlrx1�/� or WT MEFs with DNA viruses
VACA or HSV-1. Ifnb and various innate immune cytokines
were induced 6 hr postinfection. VACA infection induced more
Ifnb mRNA and MCP-1 protein compared to control MEFs (Fig-
ures 5A and 5B). Nlrx1�/� MEFs infected with HSV-1 also pro-
duced more Ifnb mRNA and IL-6 protein, as well as MCP-1
and IP-10, than control MEFs (Figures 5C–5F). Furthermore,
the extent of TBK1 and NF-kB p65 phosphorylation was higher
in Nlrx1�/� than that in control MEFs (Figure 5G). More phos-
phorylation of STAT1, which is activated by IFNb, was also
induced in Nlrx1�/� than control MEFs, consistent with the
observation that Nlrx1�/� cells produced more IFN-I compared
to control MEFs. Consistent with enhanced innate immune
response to HSV-1 infection in Nlrx1�/� cells, Nlrx1�/� BMDM
contained less HSV-1 genomic DNA than WT cells (Figure 5H).
These data suggest that NLRX1 is a negative regulator of innate
immune signals induced by DNA virus in vitro.

lacking LRR domain (X+NBD), and NLRX1 NBD were expressed in the absence or presence of HA-STING in HEK293T cells. Immunoprecipitation was performed
by anti-HA beads.
(G) Partial colocalization of NLRX1 and STING. FLAG-NLRX1 and HA-STING were coexpressed in HEK293T cells, and immunofluorescence staining was
performed. Pictures were taken using confocal microscopy. Scale bar, 20 mm.

using anti-NLRX1 or control IgG. Sig1R was used as the MAMs marker.
(I) NLRX1 attenuates STING-TBK1 interaction. STING and TBK1 were coexpressed in HEK293T cells with increasing dose of NLRX1. Immunoprecipitation was
performed with anti-HA beads.
All data are representative of at least three independent experiments.

 STING Deficiency in THP-1 Abrogates the Enhancement
of HIV-1 Infection by NLRX1
To demonstrate that the impact of NLRX1 on HIV-1 infection
occurred through a STING-dependent pathway, we generated
THP-1 cells with diminished NLRX1 and STING expression (Fig-
ure 6A). The former was reduced by shRNA, while the latter was
deleted by sgRNA. Compared to control cells, HIV-VSV infection
was enhanced by 4.91- and 2.41-fold 2 days postinfection and
3.93- and 2.12-fold 3 days postinfection in two NLRX1-deficient
cell lines. In the absence of STING, this enhancement of HIV-1
infection in the absence of NLRX1 was attenuated at 2 days
postinfection and completely abolished at 3 days postinfection
(Figure 6B). Similarly, knocking down NLRX1 expression ampli-
fied HIV-VSV-induced IFNB1 and ISG MX2 mRNA levels
compared to control cells (Figures 6C and 6D). However, induc-
tion of IFNB1 and MX2 mRNA by HIV-VSV infection was
completely abrogated in the absence of STING, regardless of
the presence or absence of NLRX1 (Figures 6C and 6D). These
data provide direct evidences that NLRX1 enhances HIV-1
infection and reduces IFNB1 and MX2 expression by negatively
regulating STING-dependent innate immune response. In the
absence of STING, NLRX1 does not exert its function.
NLRX1 Negatively Regulates Host Immunity against
HSV-1 Infection in Mice
Next, we evaluated the in vivo role of NLRX1 in host innate im-
mune defense against DNA viral infection. Nlrx1�/� or WT mice
were infected intraperitoneally with HSV-1, and their body weight
was monitored. Both WT and Nlrx1�/� mice exhibited a transient
body weight loss during the first 2 days after infection and then
started to recover at day 3 after infection (Figure 7A). WT mice
showed a 10% body weight loss at day 2, while Nlrx1�/� mice
only had a 5% weight loss; this difference was maintained
through the monitored period. As intraperitoneal delivery of
HSV-1 did not cause any mortality, we next infected WT and
Nlrx1�/� mice with HSV-1 intravenously (Zhang et al., 2014).
With a lower dose of HSV-1 infection by this route (2 3 107
PFU [plaque-forming units]/mouse), WT mice showed more
body weight loss than Nlrx1�/� mice (Figure 7B). At a higher
dose of HSV-1 infection (5 3 107 PFU/mouse), 40% of WT
mice died by day 5 postinfection, while only 9% of Nlrx1�/�
mice died at this time point (Figure 7C). Consistently, HSV-1
genome copies and live viruses were more than a log higher in
the brains of WT mice harvested at day 5 after intravenous infec-
tion than those in Nlrx1�/� mice (Figures 7D and 7E). Nlrx1�/�
mice also displayed a moderately higher production of IFNb
and IL-6 in the serum upon HSV-1 infection than WT mice (Fig-
ures 7F and 7G). Taken together, these data indicate that
NLRX1 negatively impacts the ability of the host to contain a
DNA viral infection.
DISCUSSION
The identification of negative regulators of the adaptive immune
system, such as PD-1 andCTLA-4,hasrevolutionized therapeutic
approaches to manipulate T cell immunity in infection and cancer
(Pardoll, 2012). By comparison, checkpoints or negative regula-
tors of innate immunity have been limited. This is a particularly
critical issue in HIV research, since the host immunity is ineffective
in eliminating the virus. Previous work has shown that HIV-1
exploitstheexonuclease TREX1 todegrade viral DNAandsubvert
its sensing by host cells (Yan et al., 2010). In this study, we show
that NLRX1 serves as a negative regulator of innate immunity,
resulting in the promotion of HIV-1 infection. Recent findings
have demonstrated that reverse-transcribed HIV-1 DNA induces
IFN-I and proinflammatory cytokines through initiation of the
PQBP1/cGAS innate response pathway. Our study shows
that NLRX1 inhibits IFN induced by antagonizing this pathway.
This is achieved by the association of NLRX1 with STING, which
results in a block of STING-TBK1 interaction, thereby inhibiting
TBK1 activation required for IFN-I production. From a broad
perspective, the negative regulatory impact of NLRX1 is not
limited to innate immunity elicited by HIV-1 DNA but is extended
to those caused by inflammatory DNA, cyclic dinucleotide, and
DNA viruses that are reliant on the cGAS-STING-TBK1 pathway.
Importantly, NLRX1 also attenuates DNA virus-induced innate
immune response in mouse models of infection, supporting the
physiologic importance of these findings.

 NLRX1 has been previously found to inhibit RIG-I-MAVS and
TRAF-IKK signaling (Allen et al., 2011; Moore et al., 2008; Xia
et al., 2011) but promote ROS induction (Abdul-Sater et al.,
2010; Tattoli et al., 2008) and autophagy (Lei et al., 2012). How-
ever, its impact on IFN caused by RNA viruses is not uniformly
observed (Soares et al., 2013). In this study, we found that deple-
tion of NLRX1 inhibits HIV-1 infection. This may be due to two
possibilities: by a direct alteration of antiviral IFNs or cytokines
that are secreted in the milieu or by a cell-intrinsic mechanism
such as altered autophagy. Autophagy has been shown to inter-
sect with HIV-1 biosynthesis and regulates viral yield in macro-
phages (Kyei et al., 2009). The experiment employing a transwell
system favors the former possibility and supports the impor-
tance of secreted soluble factors that are negatively regulated
by NLRX1 in HIV-1 infection. The targeted usage of anti-IFNR
antibody directly points to IFN-I as a soluble factor that is nega-
tively impacted by NLRX1, resulting in increased HIV-1 infection.
This report shows the association of NLRX1 with STING, which
disrupts STING-TBK1 interaction. NLRX1 resides in mitochon-
drial outer membrane, and STING preferentially localizes to the
ER membrane (Ishikawa and Barber, 2008; Moore et al., 2008).
The interaction between mitochondrial proteins with ER proteins
to regulate inflammation, calcium transfer, and autophagy has
been described by others (Marchi et al., 2014). For example,

the serum were assessed. In (B) and (D)–(G), the
dose of infection is 2 3 107 PFU/mouse, and in (C),
the dose of infection is 5 3 107 PFU/mouse. Data
are presented as the mean ± SEM. *p < 0.05
(Student’s t test or Mann-Whitney U test). Data
are representative of at least two independent
experiments.
STING is known to interact with the
mitochondrial outer membrane protein
MAVS at mitochondria-associated mem-
branes, contributing to RNA-triggered
RIG-I-MAVS
signaling
pathway
(Ishi-
kawa and Barber, 2008; Zhong et al.,
2008). Our finding shows that NLRX1
directly interacts with STING, as demon-
strated by using recombinant proteins. A
further analysis of MAM-enriched frac-
tions suggests that NLRX1 associates
with STING at MAM.
In addition to NLRX1, we previously
showed
that
another
NLR
protein,
NLRC3, binds to both STING and TBK1,
thus blocking their association and sub-
sequent activation (Zhang et al., 2014).
In this regard, NLRX1 functions similarly
to NLRC3 by regulating STING-dependent pathways. It is
possible that NLRC3 and NLRX1 function synergistically in
regulating cytosolic DNA-triggered innate immune response
delivered by HIV-1 or DNA viruses. It will be worthwhile to
generate mice lacking both Nlrc3 and Nlrx1 or human cells
missing both genes to test this hypothesis. Similar to NLRC3,
NLRX1 interacts with STING through its NBD domain. Thus,
NBD is emerging as a common protein-interacting domain since
the inflammasome NLRC4 also relies on the NBD domain for its
binding to NAIP2 (Hu et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2015).
NLRX1 inhibits HIV-1-mediated innate immune response
and promotes HIV-1 infection in myeloid cells; however, future
studies will be necessary to assess if NLRX1 promotes HIV-1
transmission or pathogenesis in a chronic infection. However,
a recent study showed that HIV-1 elite controllers possess an
enhanced cGAS-dependent innate response to HIV-1, and a
corresponding proliferation of CD8+ T cells (Martin-Gayo et al.,
2015). HIV-1 triggered systematic inflammation is known to
cause T cell exhaustion, CD4 T cells depletion, and immune
deficiency, while adequately inhibiting IFN-I improves antiviral
T cell function during chronic infection (Li et al., 2014; Wilson
et al., 2013). Thus, NLRX1 may benefit the host by preventing
T cell exhaustion and deficiency in chronic infection. Further-
more, activation of NF-kB has been reported to result in viral
Cell Host & Microbe 19, 515–528, April 13, 2016
525
 reactivation, while NLRX1 is known to inhibit NF-kB activity (Allen
et al., 2011; Kauder et al., 2009; Xia et al., 2011). Thus, it
is possible that NLRX1 may restrict reactivation of HIV from
latency. However, in the case of HSV-1 acute infection in mice,
our study clearly shows that blocking NLRX1 expression can
be beneficial to the host.
In summary, NLRX1 is found to serve as a checkpoint of
STING activation by HIV-1, DNA viruses, cGAMP, and dsDNA.
As a consequence, it acts as a host protein that is adopted by
HIV-1 and HSV-1 to restrict innate immunity. Taken together, tar-
geting NLRX1 may represent an approach to enhance early host
immunity mediated by IFN to restrict these viruses, as well as an
adjuvant strategy to enhance the efficacy of vaccines (Towers
and Noursadeghi, 2014). Interestingly, Barouch et al. reported
that NLRX1 level is positively correlated with simian immunode-
ficiency virus (SIV) spread and negatively correlated with antiviral
gene expression in SIV-infected rhesus monkeys, which sup-
ports the physiological importance of our findings (Barouch
et al., 2016).
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
For complete Experimental Procedures, please see the Supplemental Exper-
imental Procedures.
Experimental Animals and In Vivo Virus Infection
The C57BL/6 Nlrx1�/� mice have been described (Allen et al., 2011). Age- and
sex-matched C57BL/6 littermates were produced and used in all the experi-
ments. Mice were treated in accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care
and Use of Laboratory Animals and the Institutional Animal Care and Use Com-
mittee of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Eight-week-old mice
were infected with HSV with 2 3 107 or 5 3 107 plaque-forming units (PFU)
of viruses per mouse by intravenous injection or 2 3 107 PFU of viruses per
mouse by intraperitoneal injection. The body weight of the mice was monitored
accordingly. For cytokine studies, mice were sacrificed 6 hr postinfection and
sera were collected through cardiac puncture. For HSV-1 genome copy num-
ber and viral titer measurement, brains were harvested 5 days postinfection.
Cell Stimulation and Virus Infection
MEFs, BMDM, or peritoneal macrophages were seeded in 24-well plates and
transfected with 2 mg/ml ISD, VACV 70-mer, c-di-GMP, or cGAMP by lipofect-
amine 2000 (ThermoFisher Scientific). BMDMs were infected with HSV-1 (KOS
strain) at the indicated MOI at 37�C for 1 hr. MEFs were infected with HSV-1 or
vaccinia virus at MOI of 1 or 5 at 37�C for 1 hr. Cells were then washed with
warm PBS and cultured in complete DMEM.
siRNA Transfection
Transient knockdown of human NLRX1 was achieved by transfection of specific
siRNAs (si-NLRX1-1; QIAGEN [siNOD9_4; SI00659960], si-NLRX1-2; QIAGEN
[siNLRX1_2; SI04231255], si-NLRX1-3; QIAGEN [siNOD9_5; SI03143952]) or
unspecific negative control siRNA (si-scramble, target sequence is as follows:
50-AAGGTAATTGCGCGTGCAACT-30). siRNAs were transfected using Lipo-
fectamine RNAiMAX Reagent (Invitrogen) for HEK293T cells or Stemfect RNA
Transfection Kit (Stemgent) for MDMs and MDDCs following the manufacturer’s
instructions. Briefly, 293T cells were reverse transfected using 1.5 pmol siRNA
and 0.15 ml RNAiMAX reagent per 96 well. MDMs and MDDCs were transfected
on day 5 of differentiation after batch lift and seeding in 96-well format using
2.5 pmol siRNA and 0.136 ml stemfect reagent.
HIV-1 Propagation and Infection
The single round virus pNL4.3-Luc E-R+ (HIV-1 WT deltaEnv, encoding firefly
luciferase GL3, kind gift of Nathaniel Landau) was pseudotyped with VSV-G
(HIV-VSV). Viruses were produced as described previously (Ko
¨ nig et al.,
2008). HIV-1 R3A virus was amplified in SupT1 cells as described previously
(Guo et al., 2014).
MDMs and MDDCs were infected with HIV-VSV at an MOI of 0.25 or 0.5.
MEFs and BMDMs were infected with HIV-VSV at an MOI of 1 for 6 hr followed
by culture in complete DMEM. THP-1 cells were infected with HIV-VSV at an
MOI of 1 by spinoculation (1,000 3 g, 25�C) for 3 hr and cultured in completed
RPMI medium. Infection readout was performed 24, 48, and 72 hr postinfec-
tion by luciferase assay.
Real-Time PCR Analysis of HIV-1 Reverse Transcripts
THP-1 cells containing scrambled shRNA or shRNA for NLRX1 were infected
with HIV-VSV at an MOI of 1 by spinoculation (1,000 3 g, 25�C) for 3 hr and
cultured in completed RPMI medium. Total DNA was extracted 3, 6, 9, 12,
and 24 hr postinfection, and HIV-1 reverse transcripts were quantified by
real-time PCR as previously described (Mbisa et al., 2009).
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was carried out with Prism 5.0. All data are shown as
mean ± SEM. The mean values for biochemical data from each group were
compared by Student’s t test or Mann-Whitney U test. Comparisons between
multiple time points were analyzed by repeated-measurements ANOVA with
Bonferroni posttests. In all tests, p values of less than 0.05 were considered
statistically significant. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.
