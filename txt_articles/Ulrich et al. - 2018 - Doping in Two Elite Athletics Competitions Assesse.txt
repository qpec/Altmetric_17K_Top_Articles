Abstract 
 
Background Doping in sports compromises fair play and endangers health. To deter doping 
among elite athletes, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) oversees testing of several 
hundred thousand athletic blood and urine samples annually, of which 1-2% test positive. 
Measures using the Athlete Biological Passport suggest a higher mean prevalence of about 
14% positive tests. Biological testing, however, likely fails to detect many cutting-edge doping 
techniques, and thus the true prevalence of doping remains unknown.  
Methods We surveyed 2167 athletes at two sporting events: the 13th International 
Association of Athletics Federations Word Championships in Athletics (WCA) in Daegu, 
South Korea in August 2011 and the 12th Quadrennial Pan-Arab Games (PAG) in Doha, 
Qatar in December 2011. To estimate the prevalence of doping, we utilized a “randomized 
response technique,” which guarantees anonymity for individuals when answering a sensitive 
question. We also administered a control question at PAG assessing past-year use of 
supplements.  
Results The estimated prevalence of past-year doping was 43.6% (95% confidence interval 
39.4-47.9%) at WCA and 57.1% (52.4-61.8%) at PAG. The estimated prevalence of past-
year supplement use at PAG was 70.1% (65.6-74.7%). Sensitivity analyses, assessing the 
robustness of these estimates under numerous hypothetical scenarios of intentional or 
unintentional noncompliance by respondents, suggested that we were unlikely to have 
overestimated the true prevalence of doping.   
Conclusions Doping appears remarkably widespread among elite athletes, and remains 
largely unchecked despite current biological testing. The survey technique presented here 
will allow future investigators to generate continued reference estimates of the prevalence of 
doping.

Key Points 
 
 
Although elite athletes routinely receive biological tests to detect prohibited doping, 
these tests likely fail to detect many cutting-edge doping techniques, and thus the 
true prevalence of doping remains unknown. 
 
 
We utilized a “randomized response technique” – a method that guarantees 
anonymity for individuals when answering a sensitive question – to estimate the 
prevalence of past-year doping at two major international athletic events: the 13th 
International Association of Athletics Federations World Championships in Athletics 
(WCA) in Daegu, South Korea and the 12th Quadrennial Pan-Arab Games (PAG) in 
Doha, Qatar, both held in 2011. 
 
 
After performing numerous sensitivity analyses, assessing the robustness of our 
estimates under various hypothetical scenarios of intentional or unintentional 
noncompliance by respondents, we found that the prevalence of past-year doping 
was at least 30% at WCA and 45% at PAG. 
 
 
These findings suggest that biological testing greatly underestimates the true 
prevalence of doping in elite athletics, and indicate the need for future studies of the 
prevalence of doping in athletics using randomized response techniques.

1 Introduction  
Recent decades have seen increasingly sophisticated biological testing programs to 
deter doping among athletes, especially at elite international competitions  [1–3]. Among 
Olympic-level athletes tested between 1987 and 2013, the percentage of positive test results 
has ranged from 0.96% to 2.45% [1]. However, with sophisticated modern doping schemes 
[4–8], many athletes may beat the tests. Given the numerous recent highly publicized doping 
scandals in major sports [9–11], one might guess that the proportion of such undetected 
cheats is high. Nevertheless, the true rates of both false-negative and false-positive cases 
among tested athletes remain unknown, while subject to much continuing speculation and 
debate [12–15]. Several recent commentaries have suggested technical, human, political, 
and financial factors that may have contributed to flawed results from current biological 
testing techniques [4,16,17]. Unfortunately, however, one cannot estimate the rates of such 
false test results without an estimate of the true underlying prevalence of doping [12,18].  
To pursue this issue, we assessed the prevalence of doping at two major international 
athletic competitions using a novel method, the so-called “randomized response technique 
(RRT).” This technique allows investigators to pose sensitive questions to respondents in a 
manner that visibly guarantees the respondent’s anonymity – thus encouraging truthful 
responses. The basic idea of the technique and its variants is to include a random element 
that masks each individual’s answer to the sensitive question, thereby encouraging honest 
reports (for reviews see [19,20]). An extensive meta-analysis of RRT research [21] has 
shown that these survey techniques indeed result in more valid data than conventional 
question-and-answer methods.  
 
The RRT was originally developed by Warner in 1965 [22] to estimate the proportion 
𝜋𝑠 of “yes” answers to sensitive questions on issues where a respondent might be reluctant 
to disclose the true answer for fear of loss of confidentiality or other reasons. In Warner’s 
model, the respondent receives one of two questions about a sensitive issue. For example, 
Question A might be, “have you ever used illicit drugs?” while Question B would be the 
reverse question, “have you never used illicit drugs?” There is a known probability p that the 
 Doping in elite sports assessed by randomized-response surveys 
 
5 
 
respondent will receive Question A, and the complementary probability 1 – p that the 
respondent will receive Question B.  A random element (e.g., the throw of a die seen only by 
the respondent) determines which of the two questions the respondent receives. Thus, when 
the investigators obtain a “yes” or “no” answer from a given respondent, they cannot know 
the status of that specific respondent on the sensitive item, since they cannot know which of 
the two questions that particular individual has received and answered. However, given a 
large survey population, and knowing the value of p and the total number of “yes” answers, 
the investigators can estimate the prevalence of the sensitive item in the overall population. 
 
However, one limitation of Warner’s original technique is that both questions involve 
the sensitive topic. Thus, some respondents may believe that there is a trick that enables the 
investigators to figure out their real status on the sensitive item. To address this problem and 
make Warner’s procedure psychologically more acceptable, Greenberg, Abul-Ela, Simmons, 
and Horvitz in 1969 [23] proposed the unrelated question model (UQM; see Figure 1). 
Although the basic procedure of the UQM is analogous to Warner’s technique, Question B is 
replaced by a neutral question, such as “think of someone close to you whose birth date you 
know, and answer ‘yes’ if that person was born during the first half of the year.” In this 
example, the probability 𝜋𝑁 of a "yes" response to Question B will be approximately 𝜋𝑁 = 0.5. 
Note that although birth rates vary slightly across months [24], it can be shown that UQM 
estimates are rather robust when the true probability 𝜋𝑁 deviates from the assumed 
probability [25]. Thus, the UQM will be similarly robust if some respondents misinterpret a 
question (e.g., “were you born during the first half of the year?”) and respond incorrectly. 
 
In addition to being psychologically more acceptable than Warner’s original method, 
the UQM also has more favorable statistical properties (see [25,26]). With the UQM, the 
maximum likelihood estimator of 𝜋𝑆 is computed from the observed proportion 𝜆 of total “yes” 
responses (see [23], p. 533) as  
𝜋
̂𝑠 =
𝜆−(1−𝑝)⋅𝜋𝑁
𝑝
.                                              (1) 
With a sample of n respondents, the standard error of the estimate 𝜋
̂𝑠 is computed as

𝑛⋅𝑝2 .                                                    (2) 
With adequate sample size, this technique yields high statistical power [25].  
 
Randomized response techniques such as the UQM have been used in several prior 
studies of athletes in Germany [27–33], which all revealed a much higher prevalence of 
doping among athletes than that obtained with conventional survey methods that lacked a 
guarantee of anonymity. The first such study RRT study, to our knowledge, was performed 
by Musch and Plessner in 2002 [27]. In an online survey, these authors employed a forced-
answer version of RRT and surveyed 467 German athletes; this study reported a 42% 
prevalence of doping for the athletes during their careers.  In another online survey in 2007, 
Pitsch, Emrich and Klein [28] also employed the forced-answer version of RRT to assess 
doping among a group of 448 German top-level athletes. These researchers reported that 
between 26% and 48% of this group admitted to having used banned substances or methods 
during their athletic careers. In 2012, using a much larger sample, the same investigators 
replicated their previous finding and concluded that between 10% and 35% of German 
athletes use doping in a given season. In a recent RRT online study, Frenger, Pitsch and 
Emrich estimated the doping prevalence among about 2000 recreational and amateur 
athletes [33]. This study reported a lower limit of about 4% for the use of prohibited 
substances (i.e., approximately 4% for both lifetime use and for use during the last season).  
In another RRT study using the UQM, Striegel, Ulrich and Simon [29] assessed intentional 
doping behavior among 480 junior athletes in Germany. They estimated a lifetime prevalence 
of 6.8% for this group of athletes. Twelve-month prevalence estimates between 4% and 12% 
were observed in two German triathlon events among 2017 athletes based on two different 
RRT methods (a forced-choice RRT version and UQM) [32].  A similar RRT survey using 
UQM at three locations in Germany revealed a 12-month prevalence of 13% among a 
sample of 2997 triathletes [31].     
Based on the results of RRT studies, together with other sources (e.g., blood doping 
markers, and questionnaires), de Hon et al. [1] concluded, in a review of doping in elite

sports, that about 14-39% of elite athletes have employed doping. These authors suggest 
that RRT studies currently yield the most accurate estimates of doping in sports, and they 
suggest that this approach should be used routinely to assess the prevalence of doping. 
However, the authors note that “true doping prevalence studies have been scarce in elite 
sport so far” (p. 57).  
 
2 Methods 
2.1 Study design and participants  
We utilized the UQM method to estimate the prevalence of past-year doping at two 
elite international athletic competitions: the 13th International Association of Athletics 
Federations World Championships in Athletics (WCA) in Daegu, South Korea and the 12th 
Quadrennial Pan-Arab Games (PAG) in Doha, Qatar, both held in 2011. We chose these two 
events because they conveniently occurred a short time apart, allowing us to refine our 
methods at PAG based on experience from WCA. Thus, the study was not specifically 
designed to compare doping rates at these two events.  
 
Six data collectors, selected because they collectively spoke 10 languages, 
approached athletes at WCA and invited them to perform the survey on tablet computers. 
The survey was available in 21 languages (English, Spanish, Russian, French, Korean, 
Arabic, Portuguese, Japanese, Polish, German, Chinese, Czech, Swahili, Turkish, Greek, 
Norwegian, Romanian, Slovakian, Estonian, Croatian and Slovenian). The text of the survey 
instrument in all languages was translated by the World Anti-Doping Agency translation 
services, and then back-translated by staffs of the National Anti-Doping Agencies most 
appropriate to each language in order to maximize accuracy. At PAG, with its less 
geographically diverse athlete population, the survey was available in English, Arabic and 
French, and was administered by 10 data collectors who collectively spoke five languages. 
We obtained excellent cooperation: of the 1841 registered athletes at WCA, we approached 
1290, of whom 1203 (93.3%) agreed to participate. Of 3346 athletes accredited at PAG, we 
approached 1030, of whom 965 (93.4%) agreed to participate. At both games, the number of 
 Doping in elite sports assessed by randomized-response surveys 
 
8 
 
athletes approached was limited simply by the availability of data collectors and tablet 
computers; the athletes approached appeared representative of the entire population 
registered. Additional information about these samples appears in the appendix, section 1. 
 
2.2 Procedure 
 
The tablet computers displayed the survey questions and recorded both the athletes’ 
responses ("yes" or "no") and their response times. The latter measure enabled us to identify 
athletes who responded very quickly and hence perhaps carelessly. The first screen seen by 
the athletes (used in PAG but not at WCA) asked them to indicate the sport in which they 
were competing; this screen also included a prominent red button that athletes could press if 
they wished to decline participation. The next screen offered athletes a choice of languages 
as described above. A detailed presentation of these and all subsequent screens, together 
with an explanation of the minor differences between the instrument administered at WCA 
and that used at PAG, is provided in section 2.1 of the appendix.  
The next screen invited the athlete to proceed with the study; this screen (which now 
appeared in the athlete’s chosen language) included a prominent “no” button offering 
athletes the option to decline participation (Figure 2a). Additionally, if athletes reached a later 
screen and showed unwillingness to participate, they were directed back to this “decline” 
option – thus effectively ensuring a consent process. The subsequent screens utilized the 
UQM to estimate the prevalence of past-year doping while guaranteeing the athlete’s 
anonymity. Specifically, participants were asked to think of a person close to them (e.g., a 
parent, sibling, or spouse) whose date of birth they knew (Figure 2b). Then, if this date fell 
between the 1st and 10th day of the month, the participant was asked to answer a non-
sensitive question, Question A: “Is the person’s date of birth in the first half of the year 
(January through June inclusive)?” However, if the chosen person’s birth date fell between 
the 11st and 31th day of the month, the participant was asked to answer the sensitive 
Question B: “Have you knowingly violated anti-doping regulations by using a prohibited 
substance or method in the last 12 months?” (Figures 2c-2d).

We then analyzed the athletes' responses using equations (1) and (2) above, using 
values of 𝑝 = (365.25 – 12.10)/365.25 = 0.671 and 𝜋𝑁 =  0.5, to calculate estimates and their 
95% confidence intervals for the prevalence of past-year doping among athletes at each of 
the two events. Full methodological details of this procedure are provided in the appendix, 
sections 1-2.  
As a partial test of the validity of this methodology, we added a control question in the 
survey administered at PAG: “Have you used herbal, mineral, or vitamin supplements in the 
past 12 months?” This question was administered in a manner identical to the doping 
question (e.g., an introductory "choose a person" screen, followed by Questions A and B, 
where "B" was the "supplements" question), with the order of doping and control questions 
counterbalanced across respondents. We then estimated the prevalence of past-year 
supplement use by the formula just described. 
Finally, we performed a series of sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of our 
estimates under numerous hypothetical assumptions of noncompliance or carelessness 
among the respondents, as detailed below. 
 
3 Results 
3.1 Primary analysis 
 
We obtained strikingly high estimates of the prevalence of past-year doping at both 
events: 43.6% (95% confidence interval 39.4-47.9%) at WCA and 57.1% (52.4-61.8%) at 
PAG. The estimated prevalence of past-year supplement use at PAG was 70.1% (65.6-
74.7%). These estimates are markedly greater than the results obtained by biological testing 
at the two events. Specifically, at WCA, 440 athletes received biological testing, and only 2 
(0.5%) were found positive. At PAG, 670 athletes were tested, of whom 24 (3.6%) were 
positive. Notably, the prevalence of positive analytical findings at PAG was significantly 
greater than that at WCA (p < 0.001, two-tailed; bootstrapping the statistics D = PPAG - PWCA, 
where PPAG and PWCA are the resampled prevalence rates for PAG and WCA, respectively; N

= 100,000 bootstrap samples; the null hypothesis is 𝜇𝐷 = 0). Further details are provided in 
the appendix, section 3 (basic results). 
3.2 Analyses using response time  
We noted that some athletes showed very rapid response times, suggesting possible 
carelessness or failure to adequately read the instructions. Interestingly, at both athletic 
events, fast responders yielded even higher prevalence estimates than normal responders, 
possibly as an artifact of hasty responding. Specifically, athletes had to touch “yes” twice on 
the opening tablet screens to reach the beginning of the survey (appendix section 2 and 
Figure 2), and thus some hasty athletes might have continued to mechanistically respond 
“yes” on successive screens. Such behavioral rigidity has been documented in prior 
psychological studies [34]. Accordingly, we performed sensitivity analyses in which we 
deleted 0%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, or 50% of the fastest responders (see details in 
appendix, section 3). The prevalence estimates decreased upon deleting the 10-20% of 
fastest responders, but stabilized thereafter (Figure 3). Looking at the results obtained by 
deleting 30% or more of the fastest responders, we obtained estimates of 30-31% for past 
year doping at WCA and 45-49% for PAG. 
 
4 Discussion 
4.1 Summary 
 
We used a randomized response technique, a survey method designed to guarantee 
anonymity to respondents, to assess the prevalence of past-year doping among 2167 elite 
athletes at two major international competitions. With this method, we found that the 
prevalence of past-year doping at both events was many times greater than the 1-2% 
prevalence typically estimated from biological testing, or even the 14% figure estimated from 
the Athlete Biological Passport [8] (which does not quantify all forms of doping, in contrast to 
the present RRT survey). Our findings augment the findings of prior studies using the 
randomized response technique in more local athletic populations [27–33], which have also 
found doping to be much more prevalent than indicated by conventional survey methods or 
 Doping in elite sports assessed by randomized-response surveys 
 
11 
 
by biological testing. These results suggest that doping in elite athletics may be much more 
prevalent than has been reported before. 
4.2 Limitations  
The current findings may be limited by the possibility of various types of 
noncompliance among the respondents. To address this issue, we considered the potential 
effects of three plausible forms of respondent noncompliance. First, refusal to participate 
might have introduced selection bias, although any such bias was likely modest, since of the 
athletes approached, only 6.7% refused participation. Moreover, doping athletes likely 
refused participation more often than non-doping athletes, thus potentially causing us to 
underestimate the true prevalence of doping. Second, doping athletes directed to Question B 
might have lied and answered a self-protective “no” despite the assurance of anonymity. This 
behavior also would have led us to underestimate the true prevalence (appendix, section 
4.2). Third, some dopers, upon receiving Question B, might have surreptitiously reverted to 
non-sensitive Question A (e.g., they might have retroactively chosen a different “close 
person” born within the first ten days of the month). This phenomenon again would have 
biased our estimates downwards, since only 50% of these noncompliant dopers would 
consequently have answered “yes” (appendix, section 4.3). Thus each of these three 
possible forms of noncompliance would have caused us to underestimate the true 
prevalence of doping. 
We next considered three other seemingly less plausible scenarios. First, some non-
dopers receiving Question A might have reverted to Question B, even though they (unlike 
dopers) would have had no obvious motivation to do so. Even assuming such unlikely 
behavior, our estimates would remain little changed. For example, if 20% of dopers and 20% 
of non-dopers receiving question A had inappropriately reverted to B, our estimates would be 
biased by less than 2% (appendix, section 4.4). Second, some non-dopers might have 
falsely claimed to be dopers. However, there is little plausible motivation for such behavior, 
and empirical evidence suggests that such false self-incrimination is very rare [35]. Third, 
some athletes, regardless of doping status, might have randomly pressed "yes" or "no” 
 Doping in elite sports assessed by randomized-response surveys 
 
12 
 
without actually considering the questions, due to haste or poor reading ability. Such 
behavior would drive the estimates towards 50%, and again would have little effect on our 
results. For example, if 20% of athletes had answered randomly, our prevalence estimates 
would still be biased by less than 2% (appendix, section 4.1). Fourth, we also considered the 
effect of automatic or hasty responding with "yes" or "no”.  Although automatic yes-
responding and automatic-no responding would substantially overestimate and 
underestimate, respectively, the prevalence of doping, automatic responders were almost 
certainly excluded by our exercise of deleting 30% of the fastest responders (see section 3.2 
above, and also sections 4.6 and 4.7 in the appendix). Thus our prevalence estimates after 
deleting the 30% of fastest responders are likely to present a lower bound of the doping 
prevalence at each event. 
Finally, we considered that some athletes using prohibited substances might have 
erroneously believed that they were not doping, or conversely might have believed that they 
were doping despite actually complying with doping regulations. However, such errors would 
seem rare among world-class athletes, who are typically well educated regarding doping 
rules, and thus unlikely to misinterpret a question explicitly asking about having “knowingly 
violated anti-doping regulations.” Moreover, any such false-negative and false-positive 
misinterpretations would have biased the results in opposing directions (appendix, section 
4.9). Nevertheless, we acknowledge the limitations of utilizing a single “doping” question – 
chosen to maximize simplicity and participant compliance in this study – and would 
encourage more detailed questioning in subsequent studies. 
Also in our attempt to maximize simplicity and participant compliance, we omitted 
demographic questions such as age, gender, country of origin, or years of elite competition. 
Specifically, we considered that some athletes presented with such questions might refuse 
participation, fearing that their anonymity might be compromised (even though, in reality, the 
RRT method ensured that we could not know their doping status even if we knew their 
precise identities). Thus, we could not use these demographic measures to assess the 
representativeness of the sample of athletes who chose to participate at each event.

13 
 
However, our data on the distribution of languages chosen by athletes at WCA and the 
distribution of sports/events endorsed by athletes at PAG suggest that our samples were 
reasonably representative (see appendix, section 3 and Table 3). 
In summary, even assuming conservatively that (a) none of the first three above-
mentioned plausible forms of noncompliance caused any underestimate of the doping 
prevalence, despite their mutual risk of doing so; and (b) the entire surfeit of “yes” responses 
among the fast responders was artifactual, and did not reflect any surfeit of genuine dopers; 
we would estimate a 30-31% prevalence of past-year doping among athletes at WCA and 
45-49% at PAG. The reasons for the higher PAG estimate remain speculative, but notably, 
adverse analytical findings on biological testing were also higher at PAG, as noted above.  
Our control question at PAG, assessing past-year supplement use, yielded an 
estimate of 64-65% after deleting fast responders – a finding consistent with the results of a 
systematic review and meta-analysis on supplement use by elite athletes, which reports an 
average prevalence of dietary supplement use of 69% (95% confidence interval, 60-78%) for 
male athletes and 71% (62-79%) for female athletes [36]. Because of the heterogeneity of 
athlete populations, one must be cautious in comparing our PAG results with those from this 
meta-analysis. Nevertheless, the consistency of our results with these meta-analytic results 
offers some support for the validity of our survey methodology. 
A comprehensive analysis of possible noncompliance scenarios, detailed in the 
appendix and summarized in section 4.10, finds no combination of plausible noncompliant 
response behaviors likely to have caused our findings to be overestimates. By contrast, there 
are numerous reasons to suspect that we may well have underestimated the true prevalence 
of doping among these athletes. 
 
5 Conclusion 
Our results, combined with the results of previous recent studies [27–33], support the 
feasibility of using a randomized response technique to estimate the prevalence of doping in 
elite athletes. With this technique, we found that the prevalence of doping appears to be 
 Doping in elite sports assessed by randomized-response surveys 
 
14 
 
much higher than that indicated by biological testing. Given these provocative findings, we 
would urge continued use and refinement of this methodology to estimate the prevalence of 
doping in future sports events.

Acknowledgements We are grateful to Heba Jamal Al Ardah, Juliana Chialvo Arriola, Derek 
Jon Galotera, Ricky James, Fatma Lanouar, Dmitri Vorobyov, Ong Chin Wei, and Yoon Ji Yu 
for their help in data collection. We are especially grateful to Olivier Rabin for launching this 
project and to Georg Sandberger for legal advice. The authors are also grateful to the 
International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) and the Union of Arab National 
Olympic Authorities for their permissions to distribute the survey at 13th World Championship 
in Athletics (Daegu, South Korea, 2011) and at PAG 12th Quadrennial Pan-Arab Games 
(Doha, Qatar, 2011), respectively. The authors also appreciate the comments of the IAAF’s 
reviewers on previous drafts of the manuscript.

Funding This work was funded by the World Anti-Doping Agency / Agence Mondiale 
Antidopage, Montréal, Canada (WADA). The approximate cost of conducting the study was 
$155,000 US.  
 
Conflict of interest All authors received travel reimbursement and an honorarium of $300 
Canadian from the World Anti-Doping Agency for their work on designing the study. Andrea 
Petróczi, Perikles Simon, and Rolf Ulrich have received grant support from WADA for work 
on other studies. Léa Cléret was employed by WADA when this survey was conducted. 
Harrison Pope, Tamás Nepusz, Jay Schaffer, Gen Kanayama, and R. Dawn Comstock 
declare no competing financial interests.  
 
We would note that there was a delay of nearly 6 years between the completion of the 
data collection and the publication of this paper, due to negotiations between WADA and the 
IAAF, and subsequently between the IAAF and the authors, regarding the authority to publish

the results. This process has been described in reports in the popular media. However, the 
authors declare that neither WADA nor the IAAF has imposed any restrictions on the authors’ 
access to the data, the analysis and interpretation of the data, or the writing of this report. 
   
Ethical approval This study was conducted under the approval of the Kingston University 
Science Faculty Ethics Committee (Kingston on Thames, UK), and has been performed in 
accordance with the ethical standards as laid down in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and 
its later amendments or comparable ethical standards.

Figure 1.  Probability tree for the unrelated question model (UQM).  
a. The respondent is asked an initial personal question for which only the respondent knows 
the answer, but for which the probability p of a “no” response and the complementary 
probability q = 1 – p of a “yes” response in the overall population are known (e.g., a birthdate; 
see Figure 2). Respondents answering “yes” to the initial question are directed to a 
subsequent non-sensitive question A, for which the probability N of a “yes” answer is again 
known (e.g., another birthdate). Respondents answering “no” on the initial question are 
directed to a sensitive question B (e.g., past-year doping), where the probability S of a “yes” 
answer is unknown and represents the target of the investigation. b. The expected proportion 
 of “yes” answers from the total group of respondents is therefore a function of p, N, and 
S. In the present study, the probability p of being directed to the sensitive question was 
approximately 2/3. In addition, the probability N of answering the non-sensitive question with 
“yes” was approximately 1/2. Using these values and solving for S, the prevalence of past-
year doping would be expected to be approximately ( - 0.167)/0.667. See the main text for 
exact numbers.    
 
Figure 2: Sequential screens of the tablet-computer survey instrument. 
Athletes received an initial screen (not shown; used at PAG only) in which they could select 
their sport or alternatively decline to participate in the study. On the next screen (also not 
shown) athletes could select their preferred language. Thereafter, they were shown a series 
of screens (shown in the Figure) where they were a. asked to consent for participation in the 
study; b. asked to choose a random individual whose birthday was known to them; and c. 
instructed to answer one of two possible questions based on the birthday of the chosen 
individual. The computer then presented: d. a screen showing the two questions, where

question “A” concerned a non-sensitive issue for which the expected proportion of “yes” 
answers was known, and where question “B” concerned the sensitive issue under study 
(past-year doping). This screen contained a phrase reminding respondents that no one could 
know which of the two questions they were answering. At the PAG event, respondents also 
received a second series of screens identical to screens b-d, but with a question about use 
of supplements substituted for the doping question (screens not shown; see text).
