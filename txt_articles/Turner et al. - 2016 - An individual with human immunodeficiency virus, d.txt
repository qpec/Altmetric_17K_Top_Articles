Abstract
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)–associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) is found in
30%–50% of individuals with HIV infection. To date, no HIV1 individual has been reported to
have a positive amyloid PET scan. We report a 71-year-old HIV1 individual with HAND. Clinical
and neuropsychologic evaluations confirmed a progressive mild dementia. A routine brain MRI was
normal for age. [18F]Fluorodeoxyglucose–PET revealed mild hypermetabolism in bilateral basal
ganglia and hypometabolism of bilateral parietal cortex including the posterior cingulate/precuneus.
Resting state functional MRI revealed altered connectivity as found with individuals with mild AD.
CSF examination revealed a low Ab42/tau index but a low phospho-tau. An amyloid PET/CT with
[18F]florbetaben revealed pronounced cortical radiotracer deposition. This case report suggests
that progressive dementia in older HIV1 individuals may be due to HAND, AD, or both. HIV infec-
tion does not preclude CNS Ab/amyloid deposition. Amyloid PET imaging may be of value in dis-
tinguishing HAND from AD pathologies.

1. Introduction
More than 36.9 million individuals worldwide are in-
fected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in 2014
[1]. HIV infection has largely changed from a fatal illness
to a chronic manageable condition since the introduction
of combination antiretroviral treatment (cART) in 1996.
HIV-infected adults older than 55 years comprise the fastest
growing age group in the HIV1 population [2]. HIV-
associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) occurs in
30%–50% of HIV1 individuals treated with cART [3].
The etiology of HAND remains unclear but may be due to
viral infection and inflammation accelerating CNS aging
[4] and decreasing cognitive reserve. It is currently unknown
whether chronic HIV infection and/or treatment are risk fac-
tors for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). As an increasing fraction
of the HIV1 populace advances into the geriatric age range,
clinicians will be challenged to differentiate HAND from
other dementias of aging, including AD.

 proteomics [6]. However, a review of CSFAD biomarkers in
subjects with HAND reveals low amyloid levels in both di-
agnoses, increased phospho-tau in AD, and inconsistent tau
levels in HAND [7]. To date, no HIV1 individual has been
reported to have a positive amyloid PET scan. In fact, Ances
et al. [8] suggest that HAND is not associated with increased
CNS fibrillar amyloid as detected by amyloid PET imaging
because all five subjects examined were negative, but the
oldest was 67 years old. Given the aging HIV1 populace,
we report the sentinel case of a possible new emerging
epidemic of HAND/AD.
2. Methods and results
2.1. Case study
The subject is a 71 year-old man with a 14-year history of
HIVinfection diagnosed after presenting with flu-like symp-
toms and a viral pneumonia. He was subsequently treated
with cART. He and his wife noted mild short-term memory
problems for 5 years with insidious onset and a more notice-
able decline in the last 3 years. His symptoms manifested by
comprehension difficulty, forgetting recent conversations,
and difficulty with multitasking. Functionally, he stated
that he took longer to complete projects and sometimes
made mistakes. He could no longer work as an attorney.
His spouse stated that he had trouble learning new skills
such as using his cellular telephone. As calculations became
more challenging, his spouse assumed household financial
management. He currently shops independently but requires
a list. He performs personal care and basic activities of daily
living with minimal or no assistance. He describes his mood
as fearful of his cognitive disorder. He remains socially
active, exercises daily, and enjoys weekly religious services.
He denies aggression, anxiety, agitation, hallucinations, de-
lusions, paranoia, and suicidal ideation. He has a long-
standing history of sleep problems. His spouse also reports
frequent (2–3 times a week) episodes of violent movements
and screaming while dreaming. The patient reports these
events as acting out his dreams. His spouse also reports oc-
casional jerks of his extremities during sleep. Review of clin-
ical records indicates a stable HIV infection with consistent
compliance with cART (most recently abacavir, lamivudine,
darunavir, and ritonavir). He also takes atorvastatin for hy-
percholesterolemia. There is no history of CNS infection
or injury, stroke, transient ischemic attack, or alcohol or
drug abuse. He had one episode of loss of consciousness
with a minor head injury secondary to syncope in 2002.
His mother died at age 89 years with probable AD; his father
died at age 71 years with parkinsonism and dementia.
His physical and neurologic examination was remarkable
only for cognitive impairment. His Mini-Mental State Ex-
amination [9] score was 22/30, and Montreal Cognitive
Assessment [10] score was 20/30. He recalled zero of five
words on delayed recall. He had difficulty with repetition
and gave concrete answers to similarities. He named only

 Fig. 1. (A) The two fused FDG-PET/CT images on the left demonstrate reduced activity in the bilateral parietal cortex and posterior cingulate/precuneus. The
panel on the right shows projection maps (Syngo.via software, Siemens Medical Solutions, PA, USA) with areas of reduced activity in the temporoparietal
regions and precuneus bilaterally. A voxel-based analysis was conducted with comparison to a normal age-matched database. Regions at least 3 SDs below
the normal reference value were considered abnormal and displayed in blue. Specifically, these brain regions (with corresponding SDs below the normal refer-
ence value) were L parietal (6.5), R parietal (4.5), L frontal (3.9), and L temporal (3.1). (B) Functional MRI (fMRI). Six minutes of resting state fMRI data were
collected from 22 HIV-uninfected individuals with mild cognitive impairment (mild cognitive impairment [MCI]; n 5 8) or mild AD (n 5 14; age 69.4 6 7.5, 13
males) and 42 age-matched cognitively normal controls (age 67.4 6 5.1, 14 males). Standard fMRI preprocessing procedures were followed [12]. After regress-
ing out nuisance factors including head movements, global signal variations, and signal in white matter and CSF, we used the posterior cingulate cortex (PPC;
left and right collapsed together) as the seed region, and obtained the correlation coefficients between PPC and other brain regions. The correlation coefficients
were then z-transformed and entered into second-level whole brain analysis. The contrast of controls .MCI/AD revealed decreased connectivity between PPC
and left and right precuneus, left and right supramarginal/angular gyrus, and left and right middle temporal region (threshold, P ,.005 uncorrected, at least 200
contiguous voxels). (C) The mean Z-scores for the connectivity between PPC and the regions of interest (ROIs) identified in (B) from HIV-uninfected individ-
uals with mild AD or MCI, controls, and the subject (Subject S). The profile of resting state connectivity in this subject is similar to HIV-uninfected individuals
with MCI or mild AD. Error bars represent SEM. L/R-P, left/right precuneus; L-SA, left supramarginal/angular gyrus; R-SA, right supramarginal/angular gyrus;

 seven words beginning with F in 1 minute. His paragraph
recall was 5/25 immediately and 2/25 after 30 minutes. He
underwent two neuropsychological evaluations 27 months
apart—both consistent with dementia—which revealed in-
terval decline of working memory and verbal fluency
(Table 1). His laboratory workup revealed a chronic sub-
normal CD4 T cell count (w300–350/mL), depressed
CD4/CD8 ratio (0.75), and nondetectable plasma HIV
RNA (,20 copies/mL); all other blood tests were normal.
A polysomnogram revealed no significant sleep disordered
breathing with minimal periodic limb movements unassoci-
ated with arousals and sleep fragmentation.
A routine brain MRI revealed atrophy and white matter
changes consistent with age. [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose-
PET revealed mild hypermetabolism in bilateral basal
ganglia (consistent with HAND [11]) and marked hypome-
tabolism of parietal cortex including the posterior cingu-
late/precuneus (consistent with AD; Fig. 1A). Likewise,
resting state functional MRI (fMRI) revealed altered con-
nectivity as found in individuals with MCI/AD using the
posterior cingulate cortex as a seed region (Fig. 1B and C).
CSF examination revealed 0 cells, normal glucose (59 mg/
dL), elevated protein (118 mg/dL), a low Ab42/tau index
(consistent with AD), and a low phospho-tau (indeterminate
for AD). More specifically, analysis of CSF proteomics
revealed Ab42 237 pg/mL, total tau 285 pg/mL, phospho-
tau 49 pg/mL, and an amyloid/tau index of 0.41 (Athena Di-
agnostics, Worcester, MA, USA). An amyloid PET/CT with
[18F]florbetaben (NEURACEQ; Piramal Imaging, Matran,
Switzerland) revealed pronounced radiotracer deposition in
the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes bilaterally including
the posterior cingulate/precuneus consistent with AD
(Fig. 1D). His APOE genotype was not determined. He
was prescribed a cholinesterase inhibitor for dementia due
to AD. Enrollment in treatment trials of AD was precluded
by HIV infection.
3. Discussion
This case report suggests that progressive dementia in
older HIV1 individuals may be due to HAND, AD, or
both. We propose that the individual described here may
have a mixed dementia—HAND and probable AD, but de-
mentia due to either diagnosis alone cannot be excluded.
This case suggests that CNS HIV infection does not
preclude Ab/amyloid deposition. In fact, chronic HIV
infection may be a risk factor for AD because of neuroin-
flammation, accelerated CNS aging, and reduced cognitive
reserve—thus constituting a “double-hit.” In support of this
notion, Cysique et al. [13] report that CSF biomarker pro-
files of HIV1 individuals suggest a 10! higher risk for
AD compared with age-matched uninfected subjects.
Although CNS HIV infection may be the primary etiology
of HAND, a role for cART is also possible because of
adverse effects of chronic treatment. Consistent with this
notion, Caniglia et al. [14] report that cART regimens
with a high CNS penetration effectiveness score increase
the risk of HIV dementia. Antiretroviral medications
disrupt microglial phagocytosis of b-amyloid and increase
its production by neurons in vitro [15]. In contrast, Lan
et al. [16] suggest that cART inhibits Ab clearance in mac-
rophages and Ab production in neurons, but these effects
do not significantly alter CNS Ab accumulation in a mouse
model. Clearly, the potential interactions of HAND and AD
pathologies leading to dementia, including a possible role
of cART, require further research.
Cognitive decline in HAND may be mediated in part by
CNS Ab/amyloid accumulation [17]. Although pathologic
studies of brain show that HIV increases intracellular and
possibly extracellular Ab42, Ortega and Ances [18] suggest
that HIV1 individuals are not at increased risk for AD. Am-
yloid PET neuroimaging will be useful to distinguish puta-
tive neuropathologies of HAND—either HIV associated,
amyloid associated, or both. However, to date, only five in-
dividuals with HAND have undergone amyloid PET imag-
ing—all were negative, but the oldest subject was 67 years
old [8]. Longitudinal studies of older HIV-infected versus
uninfected cohorts are now needed to further define the
potential interactions of HIV with AD–clinically, patholog-
ically, and effects on prognostic, diagnostic, and theragnos-
tic biomarkers, including fMRI.
Older individuals with HAND may be included in the
target population of a new study designed to determine the
clinical utility of amyloid imaging in subjects with dementia
of uncertain etiology (IDEAS, or Imaging Dementia-
Evidence for Amyloid Scanning, clinicaltrials.gov #NC
T02420756). Furthermore, the optimal cART regimen for
HAND remains unclear; some investigators propose a
regimen with a high CNS penetration effectiveness to
improve efficacy. The safety and efficacy of Food and
Drug Administration-approved medications for dementia
due to AD in subjects with coexisting HAND is unclear
because HIV infection is invariably exclusionary in MCI
and AD trials. Antiamyloid and other therapies for MCI
and AD now under development may also be effective for
older HIV1 individuals. This sentinel case raises new ques-
tions regarding diagnosis, pathogenesis, and treatment of de-
mentia in older HIV1 subjects that require further studies.
L-MT, left middle temporal region; R-MT, right middle temporal region. (D) The three images on the left show areas of at least moderate amyloid deposition in
the frontal, parietal, temporal regions, and posterior cingulate/precuneus. The panel on the right shows projection maps (Syngo.via software; Siemens Medical
Solutions, USA) with areas of increased amyloid deposition (shown in red). A visual and ratio analysis was conducted using the cerebellar cortex as reference.
The SUVr is the ratio of the individual standardized uptake value (SUV) for each of the brain regions compared with the SUV of the cerebellar cortex. Spe-
cifically, the SUVr values were as follows: posterior cingulate 1.99, parietal 1.95, temporal 1.89, frontal 1.81, anterior cingulate 1.6, occipital 1.53, average

RESEARCH IN CONTEXT
1. Systematic review: Since the introduction of combi-
nation antiretroviral therapy, human immunodefi-
ciency virus (HIV) has become a manageable
chronic disorder. As a result, an increasing fraction
of the HIV1 populace is reaching the geriatric age
range and thus at risk for Alzheimer’s disease (AD).
About 30%–50% of HIV1 individuals will develop
HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HANDs).
Amyloid PETimaging has not yet been systematically
examined in older individuals with HAND.
2. Interpretation: We report the first HIV1 individual
with a positive amyloid positron emission tomogra-
phy (PET) scan. This case report suggests that
chronic HIV infection does not preclude central ner-
vous system (CNS) amyloid deposition. Individuals
with HIV may develop cognitive decline because
of HAND, AD, or both.
3. Future directions: Amyloid PET imaging may be
useful to distinguish HIV-associated pathology and/
or CNS amyloid deposition in demented individuals.
Functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may
also be a useful biomarker. Antiamyloid treatments
now under development for mild cognitive impair-
ment, and AD may be effective for some individuals
with HAND.
