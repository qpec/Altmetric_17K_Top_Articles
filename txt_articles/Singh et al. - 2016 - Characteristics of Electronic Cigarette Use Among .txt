 Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report

Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are now the most com-
monly used tobacco product among U.S. youths (1,2); in 2015, 
5.3% of middle school students and 16.0% of high school 
students reported using e-cigarettes in the past 30 days (1). 
However, limited information exists on the e-cigarette product 
types and brands used and the substances used in these prod-
ucts by youths. CDC and the Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) analyzed data from the 2015 National Youth Tobacco 
Survey (NYTS) to examine the characteristics of e-cigarette 
use among U.S. middle (grades 6–8) and high (grades 9–12) 
school students in 2015, including types of products used, 
brands of products used, and whether substances other than 
nicotine were used with the products. Among respondents 
reporting ever having used an e-cigarette, 14.5% used only 
disposable e-cigarettes, 53.4% used only rechargeable/refillable 
e-cigarettes, and 32.1% used both types. Two of the most com-
monly used e-cigarette brands were blu (26.4%, 1.65 million
youths) and VUSE (12.2%, 760,000 youths); half of students
(50.7%, 3.18 million) did not know the brand of e-cigarette
they used. One third (32.5%) of those who reported ever using 
an e-cigarette also reported having used e-cigarettes for sub-
stances other than nicotine. Preventing youths from beginning
use of any tobacco product, including e-cigarettes, is critical
to tobacco use prevention and control strategies in the United
States (3). Monitoring the characteristics of e-cigarette use
among youths, including product types, brands, and ingredi-
ents, is important to inform strategies to prevent and reduce
e-cigarette use among youths.
The NYTS is a cross-sectional, school-based, self-adminis-
tered, pencil-and-paper questionnaire administered to U.S. 
middle and high school students.* A three-stage cluster sam-
pling procedure was used to generate a nationally representative 
sample of U.S. students attending public and private schools in 
grades 6–12. In 2015, 17,711 students completed the NYTS; 
the response rate was 63.4%.
The analytic sample included 4,021 students who reported 
ever using e-cigarettes, even once or twice.† Respondents were 
asked what types of e-cigarettes they had used (disposable, 
rechargeable/refillable, or both), what brands of e-cigarettes 
they had ever tried (blu, NJOY, MarkTen, Logic, VUSE, 
Finiti, Starbuzz, Fantasia, some other brand not listed, or 
don’t know), and if they had ever used an e-cigarette for any 
substance other than nicotine (yes or no).§ Data were weighted 
to account for the complex survey design and to adjust for 
nonresponse. Among e-cigarette users, prevalence estimates and 
95% confidence intervals are reported for type of e-cigarette 
ever used, brands, and whether e-cigarettes were used for any 
substance other than nicotine. Estimates were calculated overall 
and by school level (middle or high), sex, and race/ethnicity 
(non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, or non-
Hispanic other). Population estimates rounded down to the 
nearest 10,000 were also computed. Estimates with a relative 
standard error greater than 30% were not reported.
In 2015, 13.5% of middle and 37.7% of high school students 
had ever used an e-cigarette. Among all students reporting 
having ever used an e-cigarette, 14.5% had used only dispos-
able e-cigarettes, 53.4% had used only rechargeable/refillable 
e-cigarettes, and 32.1% had used both types (Table). Use of
both types of e-cigarettes was higher among males compared
with females, and non-Hispanic white and Hispanic students
compared with non-Hispanic black students.
Among students who had ever used an e-cigarette, approxi-
mately half (50.7%, 3.18 million) did not know the brand 
of e-cigarette they had used. The most commonly reported 
e-cigarette brand was blu (26.4%, 1.65 million), followed
by “other” brands (24.2%, 1.52 million); VUSE (12.2%,
760,000); Starbuzz (5.0%, 310,000); Logic (4.6%, 280,000);
NJOY (4.5%, 270,000); Fantasia (4.1%, 250,000); MarkTen
(2.2%, 140,000); and Finiti (1.4%, 90,000) (Figure).
Approximately one third of students who had ever used an 
e-cigarette (32.5%) reported having used (at least once) an
e-cigarette for a substance other than nicotine (Table). Use
of e-cigarettes for a substance other than nicotine was higher
among males compared with females, and non-Hispanic
white and Hispanic students compared with non-Hispanic
black students. The proportion of e-cigarette users who used
an e-cigarette for a substance other than nicotine was similar
among middle (33.7%) and high (32.2%) school students.

§ The wording on the survey instrument was as follows: “Thinking about all types
of electronic cigarettes or e-cigarettes, have you used the disposable kind or
rechargeable/refillable tank kind?”; “What brands of electronic cigarettes or
e-cigarettes have you ever tried? (CHOOSE ALL THAT APPLY)”; “Have you ever 
used an electronic cigarette device for any other substance other than for nicotine?”

Discussion
Among middle and high school students who have ever 
used e-cigarettes, most report using rechargeable/refillable 
e-cigarettes, and approximately one third report having used 
e-cigarettes for substances other than nicotine. Among students 
who have ever used an e-cigarette, the most commonly reported 
brand was blu; approximately half of students did not know 
the brand of e-cigarettes they have used. Tobacco use and 
addiction typically begin during adolescence (3,4), and the 
U.S. Surgeon General has concluded that the use of products 
containing nicotine in any form among youth, including in 
e-cigarettes, is unsafe (5). Comprehensive and sustained strate-
gies are critical to prevent and reduce the use of e-cigarettes 
among U.S. youths (5).
Most e-cigarette users (53.4%) reported using a rechargeable/
refillable e-cigarette, 32.1% used both rechargeable/refillable 
and disposable devices, and 14.5% used a disposable device 
only. Disposable e-cigarettes are often similar in size and shape 
to conventional cigarettes; rechargeable/refillable e-cigarettes, 
which come in various shapes and sizes, can be readily custom-
ized by the user to include various levels of nicotine, flavors, 
and other ingredients. In addition, refillable e-cigarettes come 
in multiple device types with a range of possible voltages and 
other characteristics that can affect the heating of the e-liquid, 
release of nicotine, and formation of toxicants (5). Variations 
in the efficiency of nicotine delivery might affect the products’ 
addiction risk (6). Because e-cigarettes are the most commonly 
used tobacco product among middle and high school students, 
and nicotine exposure from any source is harmful for youths 
(5), it is critical that comprehensive tobacco control and pre-
vention strategies address the diversity of e-cigarette products 
used by U.S. youths.
Most students did not know the brand of e-cigarettes they 
used. Among those who did know the brand of e-cigarettes 
they used, blu and VUSE were the most commonly reported 
brands. The higher reported use of blu and VUSE products 
might be explained, in part, by the fact that they are owned by 
large cigarette manufacturers, and thus, are among the most 
heavily advertised e-cigarette brands in the United States (7). 
Approximately 70% of U.S. middle and high school students 
are exposed to e-cigarette advertising (8), and youths’ exposure 
to e-cigarette advertising is associated with current use (5). 
Moreover, certain e-cigarette marketers are using advertising 
tactics similar to those used in the past to market conventional 
cigarettes, employing themes and imagery conveying indepen-
dence, rebellion, and sexual attractiveness (5). The unrestricted

marketing of e-cigarettes could contribute to increasing use 
of these products among youths (5) and has the potential to 
undermine progress in preventing tobacco product use and 
promoting a tobacco-free lifestyle among youths (3,5).
Approximately one third of students reported using 
e-cigarettes for substances other than nicotine. This aligns 
with previous research, including one study of Connecticut 
high school students, in which 18.0% of those who had ever 
used an e-cigarette reported using cannabis in an e-cigarette 
(9). The present study’s finding suggests that the remaining 
majority of users have used e-cigarettes to consume nicotine. 
In contrast, a recent study using a different self-reported 
measure found that between 13% and 22% of students in 
grades 8, 10, and 12 who had ever used an e-cigarette reported 
using nicotine the last time they had used an e-cigarette (10). 
In the present analysis, it is unknown whether students who 
had used an e-cigarette for a non-nicotine substance had also 
used an e-cigarette for nicotine, which might underestimate 
nicotine use. Additional research is warranted on the presence 
of nicotine in e-cigarettes, including from data sources that 
might not be subject to the same limitations as self-reported 
data among youth, such as retail sales data (5). Nicotine 
content in e-cigarettes is of public health concern because 
exposure to nicotine is the main cause of tobacco product 
dependence (3), and nicotine exposure during adolescence, 
a critical period for brain development, can cause addiction, 
can harm brain development, and could lead to sustained 
tobacco product use among youths (3,5).
The findings in this report are subject to at least five 
limitations. First, NYTS samples middle and high school 
students from public and private schools in the United 
States; therefore, these findings might not be generalizable to 
youths who are home-schooled, have dropped out of school, 
or are in detention centers. Second, data were self-reported; 
thus, the findings are subject to bias. Third, not all brands 
of e-cigarettes were assessed; one fourth of students reported 
having used brands not mentioned in the questionnaire. 
Fourth, response bias might have affected the results because 
the NYTS response rate in 2015 was 63.4%. Finally, it was 
not possible to ascertain the specific substances used by stu-
dents reporting that they had used a substance other than 
nicotine in an e-cigarette.
Comprehensive and sustained strategies are warranted to 
prevent and reduce the use of all tobacco products, including 
e-cigarettes, among U.S. youths (3,5). Regulation of the manu-
facturing, distribution, and marketing of tobacco products by 
FDA,¶ coupled with full implementation of comprehensive 
tobacco control and prevention strategies at CDC-recommended 
funding levels, could reduce youths’ e-cigarette use and initiation 
(3,5). In addition, monitoring the characteristics of e-cigarette 
use among youths, including product types, brands, and ingre-
dients, is important to guide measures to prevent and reduce 
use of e-cigarettes among youths.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
In 2015, e-cigarettes were the most commonly used tobacco 
product among U.S. middle and high school students. Tobacco 
use and addiction typically begin during adolescence, and the 
use of products containing nicotine in any form among youth, 
including in e-cigarettes, is unsafe.
What is added by this report?
Among U.S. middle and high school students who have 
ever used e-cigarettes, most report using rechargeable/
refillable e-cigarettes, and approximately one third report 
using e-cigarettes for substances other than nicotine. Among 
students who reported ever using e-cigarettes, the most 
commonly reported brand was blu (26.4%, 1.65 million youths); 
approximately half of students did not know the brand of 
e-cigarettes they have used.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Comprehensive and sustained strategies are warranted to 
prevent and reduce the use of all tobacco products, including 
e-cigarettes, among U.S. youths. Monitoring the characteristics 
of e-cigarette use among youths, including product types, 
brands, and ingredients, is important to guide measures to 
prevent and reduce the use of e-cigarettes among youths.
