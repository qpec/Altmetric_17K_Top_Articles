Maternal age-dependent APC/C-mediated
decrease in securin causes premature sister
chromatid separation in meiosis II
Ibtissem Nabti1,2,3, Rosanna Grimes2, Hema Sarna2, Petros Marangos2,4,5 & John Carroll1,2
Sister chromatid attachment during meiosis II (MII) is maintained by securin-mediated
inhibition of separase. In maternal ageing, oocytes show increased inter-sister kinetochore
distance and premature sister chromatid separation (PSCS), suggesting aberrant separase
activity. Here, we find that MII oocytes from aged mice have less securin than oocytes from
young mice and that this reduction is mediated by increased destruction by the anaphase
promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) during meiosis I (MI) exit. Inhibition of the spindle
assembly checkpoint (SAC) kinase, Mps1, during MI exit in young oocytes replicates this
phenotype. Further, over-expression of securin or Mps1 protects against the age-related
increase in inter-sister kinetochore distance and PSCS. These findings show that maternal
ageing compromises the oocyte SAC–APC/C axis leading to a decrease in securin that
ultimately causes sister chromatid cohesion loss. Manipulating this axis and/or increasing
securin may provide novel therapeutic approaches to alleviating the risk of oocyte aneuploidy
in maternal ageing.

 T
he ability of an oocyte to undergo correct chromosome
segregation during the two meiotic divisions is essential for
production of a healthy viable fetus. It is well known that
abnormalities in chromosome segregation in female meiosis
increase during maternal aging such that after the age of 35 there
is a significant decrease in fertility, an increase in the rate of
miscarriage and an increase in the risk of chromosomal anomalies
such as Down’s syndrome1–4. The exponential relationship
between maternal age and aneuploidy (chromosome number
abnormalities) is illustrated by the finding that by the age of 40 it is
estimated that 40–60% of oocytes are aneuploid2,3,5.
The first meiotic division (MI) is thought to be the origin of
most aneuploidy1. Oocytes enter MI in fetal life and it is not until
a hormonal signal reinitiates meiosis just prior to ovulation that
MI is completed. After a brief interkinesis, oocytes progress to
metaphase
of
the
second
meiotic
division
(MII)
before
fertilization triggers the completion of MII and entry into the
first embryonic mitosis. The successful completion of the meiotic
divisions requires the co-ordinated control of chromosome
segregation
by
tightly
regulating
the
activity
of
separase,
a protease necessary for cleaving the cohesin ring that holds
chromosomes together until the correct moment6,7. Timely
activation of separase is coupled to M-phase exit by the
anaphase
promoting
complex/cyclosome
(APC/C)-mediated
destruction of the separase inhibitor, securin8–12.
Tight control of separase in MI is particularly critical because
centromeric
cohesin
needs
to
be
protected
to
maintain
sister chromatid cohesion for MII11,13,14. Thus in MI, cohesin
cleavage needs to be restricted to the chromosome arms so as to
allow for resolution of chiasmata and segregation of homologous
chromosomes. This selective cleavage of cohesin on chromosome
arms is achieved through a Shugoshin (Sgo2)-mediated prote-
ction of centromeric cohesion9,15–18. Thus, loss of this protection,
or overriding it through unbridled separase activity leads to
premature sister chromatid separation in MI due to premature
cleavage of centromeric cohesin9,15–18.
The rapid sequential progression from MI to MII also presents
significant challenges for securin-mediated control of separase.
Securin is degraded by the APC/C during exit from MI, leaving
markedly reduced levels in MII-stage oocytes19,20. Maintaining
tight control of securin during the MI-to-MII transition is
therefore essential to ensure sufficient securin remains in MII so
as to inhibit separase and maintain sister chromatid cohesion
until fertilization triggers exit from MII19.
Cohesin is particularly susceptible to aging and chromosome-
associated cohesin levels are reduced in oocytes from old mice21–23.
This loss of cohesin is thought to be the basis of increased
aneuploidy caused by maternal aging3,4 although it is likely to
be
compounded
by
other
aging-related
deficits,
including
a
compromised
ability
to
correct
kinetochore-microtubule
miss-attachments24 and a decrease in the ability of the spindle
assembly
checkpoint
(SAC)
to
detect
incorrectly
attached
chromosomes25. The susceptibility to premature loss of cohesin is
considered to be due to the fact that cohesin is loaded onto
chromosomes as oocytes enter meiosis in fetal life and, as
demonstrated by elegant genetic studies in mice, there is no
capacity to reload cohesin once it is lost26. Thus, an aging-related
loss of cohesin due to accumulated insults and cellular damage is
thought to contribute to destablization of chiasmata; the cross-over
sites responsible for holding homologous chromosomes together in
MI4. Additional mechanisms that lead to the loss of Sgo2-mediated
protection of centromeric cohesin have also been implicated and
is supported by the finding that premature sister segregation
occur in MI27 as well as MII28. The fact that premature sister
separation is seen in MII and is a relatively a common form of
aneuploidy in mouse and human oocytes21,23,28–30 raises the
possibility that deficits in cohesin seen in aged oocytes could well be
further exacerbated if separase activity was increased in MII oocytes
as a result of aberrant securin depletion at exit from MI.
Here, we find that securin levels are reduced specifically in MII
oocytes from old mice. The cause appears to be an increased
APC/C-mediated securin destruction in old oocytes; an effect
that can be phenocopied in young oocytes by inhibiting the
SAC component, monopolar spindle 1 (Mps1) Kinase, during the
destruction phase. Finally, we show that restoring securin levels
or
overexpressing
Mps1
partially
reverses
the
inter-sister
kinetochore distance and decreases the frequency of premature
sister chromatid separation (PSCS).
Results
Decreased sister cohesion in MII eggs from aged MF1 mice.
Because strain differences have been reported in the susceptibility
of oocyte quality to aging25, we first set out to determine if MII
eggs from our laboratory-aged MF1 mice exhibit age-related
changes
reported
in
other
laboratories.
These
include
chromosome misalignment, increased inter-sister kinetochore
distance and PSCS. To analyse chromosome alignment in
MII-arrested oocytes from young (1 month old) and old
(13–14 month old, hereafter referred to as 41 year old) mice,
we generated confocal z-stacks of DNA and microtubules in fixed
MII oocytes. The images revealed that 45% of MII oocytes from
old mice had evidence of misaligned chromosomes compared to
only 15% of young controls (Fig. 1a,b). Next, we used monastrol
to induce monopolar spindles which, after staining with Hoechst
and CREST, provide an in-situ chromosome spread on which it is
possible to measure inter-sister kinetochore distance31–33. In MII-
arrested eggs from old mice, there was a highly significant 2-fold
increase in inter-sister kinetochore distance compared to controls
(Fig. 1c,e). Furthermore, the incidence of PSCS in old oocytes was
63% compared to only 8% in young control oocytes (Fig. 1d,e).
These data demonstrate that in our MF1 aging model, there is a
significant disruption to spindle formation and to sister cohesion,
most likely caused by the previously reported age-dependent
decrease in cohesin21,23,24,28,34–36.
Age-related decrease in securin stability. The two consecutive
meiotic cell divisions create a significant challenge in that cell cycle
proteins destroyed on exit from MI are then needed again for
controlling entry into and exit from MII. Securin, the inhibitor of
separase, is one such protein. Unlike cyclin B1, the level of securin
remains low after MI19,20, such that securin levels in MII oocytes
are B30% of that seen in MI (Supplementary Fig. 1). Despite this
relatively low level of securin, we have previously shown that
securin is essential for inhibition of separase in MII19. Given the
increase in inter-sister kinetochore distance and PSCS in old
oocytes, we investigated the levels of securin in young and old
MII oocytes. Analysis of immunoblots revealed a significant
48% decrease in the amount of securin in old MII oocytes
compared to young controls (Fig. 2a,b). To examine whether these
differences existed prior to MII, we performed western blots on
germinal vesicle (GV) and MI-stage oocytes. In contrast to MII, the
endogenous levels of securin in the GV and MI stages were not
affected by maternal age (Fig. 2c–f). These data suggest that in old
oocytes an increase in securin instability in the MI-to-MII
transition leads to a reduced level of securin in MII oocytes.

(Supplementary
Fig.

However,
consistent
with
the
observed
decrease
in
the
level
of
endogenous securin in old oocytes, the rate of securin-GFP
destruction was significantly increased in oocytes from old mice
compared to young controls (Fig. 3a,b and Supplementary
Fig. 2b). A number of factors may explain the mechanism
underlying the increased securin degradation in the MI-to-MII
transition
including
an
increase
in
APC/C
activity,
post-translational modification of securin, or a change in the
capacity of the 26S proteasome. Of these possibilities, we have
previously found securin phospho-mutants all get degraded at a
similar rate (unpublished data) and there is no evidence that the
proteasome is limiting in oocytes. In contrast, the APC/C is
highly regulated during meiosis and two recent independent
studies have shown that APC/C activity at the MI-to-MII
transition is restrained by residual SAC activity. In these
studies, inhibition of the SAC using Mps1 inhibitors resulted in
an increased rate of APC/C substrate degradation during exit
from MI31,37. In addition, oocytes from old mice have been
shown to have a reduced level of SAC components, such as
BubR1 (budding uninhibited by benzimidazoles related 1)25,38.
Therefore, we have asked whether the age-related increase in
securin destruction during the MI-to-MII transition and the
associated decrease in securin at the MII stage are caused by
a decrease in residual SAC activity in old oocytes.
First, given that oocytes from old mice are reported to have
decreased levels of BubR1 (refs 25,38) and because compromised
SAC activity is usually associated with a loss of SAC components
from the kinetochores, we went on to examine whether the
kinetochore level of BubR1 in late MI (11 h post release), just
prior to PB1 extrusion, differs in young and old eggs. As an
additional positive control, the essential SAC kinase, Mps1, was
inhibited by including AZ314631 in the media from 7.5 h after
release.

was
significantly decreased by 39% in old oocytes relative to young
controls (Supplementary Fig. 3), while young AZ3146-treated
oocytes showed a 73% decrease compared to untreated controls
(Supplementary Fig. 3). These finding support the idea that the
residual SAC activity during the MI-to-MII transition may be less
effective in old oocytes due to a reduced level of BubR1 remaining
on the kinetochores, even at this late stage of MI.
To address the potential role of the SAC–APC/C axis in
causing the increased rate of securin destruction in old eggs we
have asked whether inhibition or activation of the SAC is
sufficient to replicate the effects of maternal ageing on young
oocytes. If the SAC is the responsible factor, its inhibition at the
start of APC/C activity would be predicted to lead to similar rates
of securin destruction in young and old oocytes. To test this
hypothesis Mps1 was inhibited (as above) so as to prevent SAC
activity during exit from MI and securin-GFP destruction was
measured. The data confirm the hypothesis and show that
inhibition of the SAC increases the rate of securin destruction in
young oocytes to levels similar to that of oocytes from old mice
(Fig. 3c,d and Supplementary Fig. 2c).
The inhibition of the SAC in both young and old oocytes
results in a much sharper onset of destruction compared to

 untreated oocytes (compare peak of graphs in Fig. 3a,c). To test
whether this is simply an effect the Mps1-inhibitor synchronizing
the time of onset of destruction, we plotted the securin
destruction data normalizing the peak of each trace to start the
same point in time (Fig. 3e–g). The data show that despite
removing the variability in time of onset of destruction in control
oocytes (Fig. 3e), there remains a markedly faster onset of
destruction in Mps1-treated oocytes (Fig. 3f). This is clearly
illustrated when plotting old control and Mps1 inhibitor-treated
oocytes on the same graph; although the maximal rate of
destruction is the same, the inflection point is sharper in the
inhibitor-treated oocytes leading to a delay in the destruction
by about 20 min. These observations reveal that in control
conditions in both young and old oocytes the SAC is switched off
slowly in a graded manner rather than it being a switch-like
mechanism as is imposed in the presence of the Mps1 inhibitor.
Having
shown
that
Mps1
inhibition
in
young
oocytes
accelerates securin destruction to rates similar to that seen in
old oocytes, we asked whether Mps1 inhibition can also
recapitulate the decrease in securin seen in oocytes from old
mice (Fig. 2). Western blotting shows that oocytes treated with
Mps1-inhibitor during the MI-to-MII transition do indeed have a
40% reduction in securin at the MII stage (Fig. 3h,i). Thus
modulating the SAC, and by inference, APC/C activity, during
the MI-to-MII transition is sufficient to mimic the effects of
maternal ageing on the levels of securin in MII oocytes.
Rescue of the age-related increase in sister cohesion loss. Next,
we examined if increasing the rate of securin destruction in young
oocytes in the MI-to-MII transition can also cause an increase
in inter-sister kinetochore distance in young oocytes as is
seen in old oocytes21,23,24,28,36 (Fig. 1). Oocytes were treated with
AZ3146-7.5h after release and allowed to progress to the MII stage
at which point they were fixed and processed for in-situ
chromosome
spreads
and
CREST-labeling
of
kinetochores.
Measurement of the inter-sister kinetochore distances revealed
that inhibition of Mps1 in young oocytes phenocopies the
age-related loss in sister-kinetochores attachment by causing a
significant (almost 3-fold) increase in the inter-sister kinetochore
distance compared to non-treated controls (Fig. 4a,b).
Given
these
findings,
we
asked
whether
expression
of
exogenous Mps1 could protect against the increased inter-sister
kinetochore distance seen in oocytes from old mice. Mps1-GFP
cRNA was injected into GV oocytes from young and old mice and
the oocytes were matured to the MII stage (14 h). After expression
of Mps1-GFP, inter-sister kinetochore distances were significantly
reduced in oocytes from old mice and no effect was seen in
oocytes from young mice (Fig. 4c,d). Thus, manipulating the
SAC–APC/C axis via inhibition or expression of Mps1 not only
replicates the changes in securin in old oocytes, it also predictably
impacts inter-sister kinetochore distances.
Finally, given that depleting securin in MII oocytes leads to
PSCS19 and that MII-stage oocytes from old mice have reduced
levels of securin, we have asked whether increasing the level of
securin in oocytes from old mice can protect against the observed
decrease in cohesion and increase in PSCS. We first confirmed
that injection of securin-GFP cRNA into GV-stage oocytes led to
a detectable securin-GFP fluorescence in MII-stage oocytes
(Supplementary Fig. 4). The inter-sister kinetochore distance in
old oocytes injected with securin-GFP is less than that seen in
non-injected old oocytes (Fig. 4d). Increasing the level of securin
in young oocytes had no effect on inter-sister kinetochore
distances (Fig. 4e) suggesting that securin levels are limiting in
old eggs but not young. To check that the ability of securin
(and Mps1) expression to reduce inter-sister kinetochore distance
was not due to a small number of oocytes showing large
inter-sister kinetochore distances, we also analysed the mean
inter-sister kinetochore distance/oocyte (Supplementary Fig. 5).
This confirmed the analysis performed by measuring individual
sister kinetochore pairs across a population of oocytes and
supports the conclusion that securin-GFP expression protects
against the loss of cohesion in MII-stage oocytes from old mice.
Furthermore, the protection of cohesion in securin-GFP-injected
oocytes from old mice is accompanied by a 27% decrease in
the incidence of PSCS (Fig. 4f).
Discussion
The findings presented here demonstrate a new mechanism
underlying the effects of maternal age on oocyte quality. We find
that MII-stage oocytes from old mice have a reduced level of
securin compared to oocytes from young mice. It is proposed that
this is caused by an increased rate of securin destruction during
the MI-to-MII transition and that this aberrant increase in
securin degradation leads to incomplete inhibition of separase
resulting in premature loss of sister chromatid cohesion.
The finding that restoration of securin levels or increasing
Mps1 can partially recover inter-sister kinetochore distance and

 PSCS has implications for future research directions and potential
therapeutic approaches to blunting the impact of maternal age on
oocyte quality.
Our study identifies the mechanism leading to the observed
decrease in securin in oocytes from old mice. The finding that old
oocytes destroy APC/C substrates at a faster rate was unexpected
but is consistent with recent studies showing that in young
healthy oocytes undergoing MI exit, the APC/C is restrained by
SAC components31,37. Here, we show that this SAC-mediated
restraint appears to be compromised in oocytes from old mice.
The evidence supporting a role for the SAC in the increased
APC/C-mediated securin destruction in old oocytes includes
(i) the fact that inhibiting the SAC during the MI-to-MII
transition in young control oocytes leads to an increased rate of

 securin destruction and reduced MII levels of securin, similar to
that seen in old oocytes, and (ii) the observation that the level of
kinetochore-localized
BubR1
during
MI
exit
is
decreased
compared to young controls. Thus, our data strongly implicate
aging-related decreases in SAC function to be the cause of
increased APC/C-mediated securin destruction in the MI-to-MII
transition.
The role of the SAC in aging-related oocyte defects has been
subject to much experimentation. Initial studies indicated that the
SAC was unaffected in old oocytes because the time of polar body
formation is the same in young and old oocytes; an ineffective
SAC should allow for faster progression into MI exit39,40.
However, more recent studies have revealed that the SAC
is less effective in response to nocodazole24 or DNA damage-
induced38
chromosome
anomalies.
This
subtle,
context
dependent decrease in SAC function in old oocytes, together
with the recent discovery that the SAC restrains the active APC/C
during the MI-to-MII transition37, is consistent with our
observation
that
old
oocytes
have
an
increased
APC/C-
mediated destruction of securin.
One consequence of increased APC/C-targeted destruction
of securin in the MI-to-MII transition is that old oocytes
have a 48% decrease in the levels of securin compared to
young controls and an accompanying increase in inter-sister

 and sufficient for separase inhibition at MII14,19. Thus, given the
relatively low levels of securin at the MII stage, the further
reduction of securin in old MII oocytes may breach the threshold
necessary to maintain a tight grip on separase activity, resulting in
compromised cohesion and increased aneuploidy24,28. Intere-
stingly, securin knock-out mice show sub-fertility with a litter size
approximately half that of wild-type controls41. This is consistent
with our study and it would be interesting to investigate the origin
of this fertility loss to determine whether it is caused by an
increase in aneuploidy as well as to investigate whether there is
any compensation acting to inhibit separase via other pathways42.
Our data provide evidence supporting a role for the SAC–APC/C
axis and decreased securin in the loss of cohesion in MII oocytes.
Firstly, inhibition of the SAC in young oocytes undergoing the
MI-to-MII transition leads to loss of cohesion, similar to that seen
in old oocytes. Secondly, expressing Mps1 in old oocytes partially
reverses the increase in inter-sister kinetochore distance and finally,
that expression of exogenous securin to enhance separase inhibition
in
MII
oocytes
leads
to
a
partial
rescue
of
inter-sister kinetochore distances and PSCS in old oocytes. These
data are consistent with an important role for SAC-mediated
restraint of APC/C-mediated destruction of securin so as to
maintain sufficient levels to provide a complete inhibition of
separase during the transition into MII. The partial nature of the
ability to rescue the phenotype with exogenous Mps1 or securin
suggest that it is likely that other factors emanating from MI events
also contribute to the decrease in cohesion seen in old MII oocytes.
Previous studies in mouse and human oocytes have demon-
strated a maternal aging-associated loss of cohesion in both MI
and MII, but a particular increase in PSCS in MII oocytes has also
been reported5,28. The aging-related loss of cohesion in MII is
attributed to a decrease in centromeric cohesin caused by a loss of
Sgo2-mediated cohesin protection9,23,28 or due to a more generic
loss of cohesin function due to age and associated environmental
insults3,43. These factors will undoubtedly contribute to the
defects in cohesion seen in old MII oocytes but our study shows
that these underlying deficits may be amplified if securin levels
are reduced and thereby allow for incomplete inhibition of
separase. As such, the integrity of cohesin in maternal aging of
MII oocytes is likely compromised via a number of modalities.
Our findings suggest novel approaches to therapeutically
improving sister chromatid cohesion in MII and therefore
decreasing the rates of aneuploidy seen in oocytes from old
mothers. Two approaches have been shown to decrease inter-sister
kinetochore distances in old oocytes: first, increasing the oocyte
levels of Mps1 to strengthen the SAC during MI exit and secondly,
restoring the levels of securin to enhance separase inhibition in MII
oocytes. These approaches both improve cohesion but they target
the same pathway so are unlikely to be additive. However,
combining one of these approaches with increasing Sgo2 to
increase protection of centromeric cohesin may provide a highly
effective combinatorial approach to improving the fidelity of
chromosome number of oocytes in cases of advanced maternal age.
Methods
Animals. All oocytes were collected from 1 month or 41 year (13–14 months) old
female MF1 mice (Harlan). All experiments were preformed according to licensed
procedures under a Home Office Project Licence to JC.
Oocytes collection and culture. For GV oocytes, females were super-ovulated by
intraperitoneal injection of 7.5 IU of pregnant mares’ serum gonadotrophin
(PMSG, Intervet). Mice were killed by cervical dislocation at 46–48 h after PMSG
injection. The ovaries were removed and immediately transferred to dissection
medium, consisting of M2 medium supplemented with 200 mM IBMX, to keep the
oocytes arrested at the GV stage. The cumulus-enclosed oocytes were isolated by
mechanical perforation of the ovaries with a 27-gauge needle. The cumulus cells
were removed by repeated mouth pipetting, using narrow-bore glass Pasteur
pipettes. To obtain MII-stage oocytes, mice were first injected with 7.5 IU PMSG,
followed by 5 IU of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) 48 h later. 14 h after
hCG injection, mice were killed as before and oviducts were dissected and
transferred into M2 medium at 37 �C. Masses of cumulus-enclosed MII oocytes
were released from oviducts using forceps. Overall, 300 IU ml � 1 hyaluronidase was
then added to the medium to remove the cumulus cells; oocytes were collected by
mouth pipetting and washed in M2 medium. For longer-term incubation, GV and
MII oocytes were cultured in M16 in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator at 37 �C.
Treatment with inhibitors. For Mps1 inhibition, oocytes were incubated in
culture media (M2 or M16) containing 2 mM AZ3146 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).
Microinjection and imaging. All microinjections of GV-stage oocytes were
performed in M2 medium on the stage of an inverted microscope (Leica DM IRB,
Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). Briefly, fabricated micropipettes were inserted
into oocytes using the negative capacitance overcompensation facility on an
electrophysiological amplifier (World Precision Instruments, UK) while
immobilized using a holding pipette (Hunter Scientific). A precise injection volume
(2–5% of the total egg volume) was achieved using a Pneumatic PicoPump.
Epi-fluorescence images of oocytes incubated in M2 medium at 37 �C were
recorded using a (20 � 0.75 NA) objective and a Princeton Instruments
MicroMax interline cooled CCD camera (Roper Scientific, Buckinghamshire, UK).
GFP-tagged securin was imaged using a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) filter set
at band pass 450–490 nm for excitation, dichroic mirror 510 nm and band pass
520 nm for emission. Metamorph (MM) and metafluor (MF) software 6.1
(Universal Imaging, PA, USA) were used for image capture and data analysis.
Oocytes were imaged every 10 min to minimize photobleaching and photodamage.
Immunofluorescence. Oocytes were fixed and permeabilized in PHEM buffer
(60 mM Pipes, 25 mM Hepes, 10 mM EGTA and 2 mM MgCl2) containing
4% paraformaldehyde and 0.5% Triton X-100 and then labelled with mouse
anti–b-tubulin (T4026; 1:1,000; Sigma-Aldrich), and 10 mg ml � 1 Hoechst 33342
(Sigma-Aldrich). Serial z sections of fixed oocytes in PBS were acquired at room
temperature using a Plan Apochromat 63 � , 1.4 NA oil differential interference
contrast objective and a laser-scanning confocal microscope imaging system
(LSM 510 META; Carl Zeiss) with the following band pass emission filters in nm
385–470 (Hoechst 33342) and 585–615 (Alexa Fluor 546). Z sections were analysed
and projected onto a single plane using the LSM image browser (Carl Zeiss).
Chromosome spreads. Chromosome spreads were performed as previously
described31–33. In brief, spindles were collapsed using a 90-min pulse of 200 mM
monastrol (EMD Millipore). Oocytes were fixed and permeabilized in PHEM
buffer, labelled with calcinosis, Raynaud’s phenomenon, oesophageal dysmotility,
sclerodactyly, and telangiectasia (CREST) serum, a human centromere antiserum,
(1:300; kind gift from Bill Earnshaw, University of Edinburgh, UK), rabbit
anti-BubR1 (1:300; kind gift from Stephen Taylor, University of Manchester, UK),
10 mg ml � 1 Hoechst 33342 and mounted on slides in PBS. Serial z sections were
acquired at 1-mm intervals at room temperature using a Plan Apochromat 63 � ,
1.4 NA oil differential interference contrast objective and a laser-scanning confocal
microscope imaging system (LSM 510 META) with the following band pass
emission filters (nm): 385–470 (Hoechst 33342), 505–530 (Alexa Fluor 488) and
585–615 (Alexa Fluor 546). Z sections were analysed and projected onto a single
plane using the LSM image browser.
Complementary RNA. The cRNA for GFP-tagged securin and Mps1 were
prepared from the T3-promoter of a pRN3-GFP vector, using T3 mMESSAGE
mMACHINE kit (Ambion). The cRNA was then polyadenylated and purified in
nuclease-free water to a concentration of B1 mg ml � 1 before microinjection.
Western blotting. Oocytes were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with
1% polyvinylpyrolidone (PVP) solution and then heated at 95 �C for 5 min with
5 � sample buffer. Proteins were fractionated at 200 mV for 50 min on an X Cell II
blot Module (Invitrogen, UK) using a 4–12% NuPage Bis-Tris pre-cast gel
(Invitrogen) and MOPS running buffer. Proteins were blotted onto polyvinylidened
fluoride membranes (PVDF) for 1 h 30 min at 100 mV. Anti-securin (ab3305,
1:1,000, AbCam, UK) and anti-beta actin (ab3280, 1:400, AbCam, UK) were used
for western blotting. For primary antibody detection we used HRP-conjugated
anti-mouse/rabbit secondary antibodies (Sigma, UK). Standard enhanced
chemiluminescence (ECL) techniques (Amersham Biosciences, UK) were used for
secondary antibody detection according to manufacturer’s instructions. Actin
was always used as a loading control and the densitometric analysis of the blots
involved the measurement of the intensity of each band, which was then
normalized against the relevant actin loading control. The whole gel images of
western blots are presented in Supplementary Fig. 6.
Data analysis. The rate of securin-GFP destruction per hour was calculated
according to the formula (Fl1–Fl2)/(t2 � t1). t1 and t2 are the time points that

7
 correspond to Fl1 and Fl2, respectively. Background fluorescence was subtracted
from cell fluorescence.
To measure the inter-sister kinetochore distance, we used ImageJ software
(National Institutes of Health). In brief, a linescan was drawn across each pair of
CREST-labelled sister kinetochores. The inter-sister kinetochore distance was then
measured as the distance between the two peaks of fluorescence, which represent
the centre of each kinetochore. However, when the sister kinetochores were not in
the same plane of focus, we used the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the actual
inter-sister kinetochore distance.
For BubR1 levels measurement, we used ImageJ to measure the fluorescence of
each kinetochore from a single z section. The CREST image was used for
localization comparison. As background, we used the mean fluorescence of an area
surrounding the DNA, which was then subtracted from the kinetochore
fluorescence.
Statistics. All experiments were repeated at least twice with individual sample
sizes of 10–40 oocytes, which is sufficient to determine the magnitude of the effect.
For each experiment, oocytes were collected from at least two randomly chosen
animals and in all cases oocytes from individual mice were pooled and randomly
assigned to groups. Where appropriate (such as measurement of inter-kinetochore
distances), samples were analysed blind with experimental groups being
de-identified and decoded after analysis. For all data, the appropriate statistical test
was used and performed using Prism software (GraphPad Software). Individual
variance in the datasets is provided by showing each experimental point and
standard error bars.
