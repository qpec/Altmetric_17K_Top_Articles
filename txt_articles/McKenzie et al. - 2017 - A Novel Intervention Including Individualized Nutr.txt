Abstract
Background: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is typically managed with a reduced fat diet plus glucose-lowering medications, the latter
often promoting weight gain.
Objective: We evaluated whether individuals with T2D could be taught by either on-site group or remote means to sustain
adequate carbohydrate restriction to achieve nutritional ketosis as part of a comprehensive intervention, thereby improving
glycemic control, decreasing medication use, and allowing clinically relevant weight loss.
Methods: This study was a nonrandomized, parallel arm, outpatient intervention. Adults with T2D (N=262; mean age 54, SD
8, years; mean body mass index 41, SD 8, kg·m−2; 66.8% (175/262) women) were enrolled in an outpatient protocol providing
intensive nutrition and behavioral counseling, digital coaching and education platform, and physician-guided medication
management. A total of 238 participants completed the first 10 weeks. Body weight, capillary blood glucose, and
beta-hydroxybutyrate (BOHB) levels were recorded daily using a mobile interface. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and related biomarkers
of T2D were evaluated at baseline and 10-week follow-up.
Results: Baseline HbA1c level was 7.6% (SD 1.5%) and only 52/262 (19.8%) participants had an HbA1c level of <6.5%. After
10 weeks, HbA1c level was reduced by 1.0% (SD 1.1%; 95% CI 0.9% to 1.1%, P<.001), and the percentage of individuals with
an HbA1c level of <6.5% increased to 56.1% (147/262). The majority of participants (234/262, 89.3%) were taking at least one
diabetes medication at baseline. By 10 weeks, 133/234 (56.8%) individuals had one or more diabetes medications reduced or
eliminated. At follow-up, 47.7% of participants (125/262) achieved an HbA1c level of <6.5% while taking metformin only (n=86)
or no diabetes medications (n=39). Mean body mass reduction was 7.2% (SD 3.7%; 95% CI 5.8% to 7.7%, P<.001) from baseline
(117, SD 26, kg). Mean BOHB over 10 weeks was 0.6 (SD 0.6) mmol·L−1 indicating consistent carbohydrate restriction. Post
hoc comparison of the remote versus on-site means of education revealed no effect of delivery method on change in HbA1c
(F1,260=1.503, P=.22).
Conclusions: These initial results indicate that an individualized program delivered and supported remotely that incorporates
nutritional ketosis can be highly effective in improving glycemic control and weight loss in adults with T2D while significantly
decreasing medication use.

Introduction
Type 2 diabetes is generally regarded as a chronic, progressive
disease that can be slowed by the vigorous use of lifestyle
changes and medications but eventually results in vascular
damage and end-organ failure [1,2]. Current medical treatment
interventions result in virtually no disease remission, as seen in
a study within the Kaiser health care population where the
spontaneous remission rate is 0.5% [3]. As the disease
progresses, it has been shown that glucose-lowering medication
use, health care costs, and complications all rise. At 9 years,
less than 25% of patients are able to control their blood glucose
level with only one medication [4], and 10-15 years after the
diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, more than 50% of patients will
require insulin [5].
Despite the overall paucity of type 2 diabetes remission data,
there exist three notable treatment exceptions. Bariatric surgery,
such as gastric bypass, is effective at reversing type 2 diabetes,
with 40%-60% of surgical patients demonstrating remission 1
year after the surgery. The most comprehensive study of surgical
intervention to prevent or reverse type 2 diabetes is the Swedish
Obese Subjects Trial [6], demonstrating an 8-fold reduction in
the incidence of the disease at 2 years. However, further out
into the postoperative experience, many of these patients regain
weight and relapse into diabetes, and they are at risk of
developing nutritional deficiencies as well [7].
There have been many reports of short-term improvement in
glycemic control with very low-calorie diets (VLCDs) consisting
of either common foods or chemically defined formulas, ranging
in energy from 400-800 kcal·day−1. Bistrian et al [8]
administered a common-food 600-800 kcal·day−1 VLCD to 7
insulin-using subjects with type 2 diabetes for inpatient and
outpatient durations of 2-12 months. All 7 subjects achieved
rapid improvement in glycemic control despite the cessation of
insulin therapy, and 6 of 7 subjects experienced substantial
weight loss. Bauman et al [9] hospitalized 64 patients with type
2 diabetes, including 42 patients taking insulin, and administered
a VLCD for a mean of 23 days. After 19 months, 10 patients
remained in remission. Wing et al [10] randomized 93 obese
individuals with type 2 diabetes to either a low-calorie diet or
an intermittent formula VLCD for 1 year. The VLCD group
achieved greater initial weight loss and greater hemoglobin A1c
(HbA1c) reductions, but these differences between the 2 diet
arms were not sustained over the duration of the study. In a
recent study by Steven et al [11], 13 of 30 individuals with type
2 diabetes but not using insulin achieved normal blood glucose
values after 8 months of lifestyle intervention. In this case, a
chemically defined, liquid, low-carbohydrate VLCD was
prescribed for 8 weeks, followed by 6 months of an unspecified
energy maintenance diet.
These 4 studies [8-11] used VLCDs to control blood glucose
level while stopping or reducing diabetes medications. The
limitation of using a VLCD to manage a chronic disease is that
this type of diet is necessarily temporary, given that it provides
less than 800 kcal·day−1 and thus is unsustainable in the long
term.
Alternatively, nutritional ketosis, defined as a dietary regimen
resulting in serum beta-hydroxybutyrate (BOHB) levels between
0.5 and 3.0 mmol·L−1 [12], may yield similar or better results
over longer periods of time by not explicitly prescribing caloric
restriction. Nutritional ketosis is often achieved by reduced
carbohydrate, moderate protein, and increased fat intake. In this
setting, moderately reduced energy intake may occur in
association with the proportionately high fat intake, reduced
circulating insulin due to reduced carbohydrate consumption,
and potential metabolic benefits of mild ketonemia. For example,
Boden et al [13] reported that in patients with type 2 diabetes
fed a ketogenic diet to satiety improved insulin sensitivity by
75% within 2 weeks. When given free access to a ketogenic
buffet, daily energy intake dropped by about one-third, resulting
in a total weight loss of 2 kg over 2 weeks. The authors
concluded that this modest weight loss in and of itself could not
explain the improved insulin sensitivity.
There have been a number of studies using low-carbohydrate,
high-fat dietary strategies in the management of type 2 diabetes
[14-20], but these group sizes have been small and often
excluded subjects taking insulin. In addition, the dietary
interventions used in these studies frequently were not
sufficiently low in carbohydrate or protein to induce sustained
nutritional ketosis. However, multiple studies of ketogenic diets
prescribed without energy restriction have demonstrated both
tolerability and effectiveness of this dietary approach to improve
a broad range of cardiometabolic markers in prediabetic and
dyslipidemic outpatients [21-23]. And finally, recent studies
have identified BOHB in the nutritional ketosis range as a potent
epigenetic signal that decreases oxidative stress [24], hepatic
glucose output [25], and insulin resistance [26].
We therefore hypothesized that a comprehensive program with
individualized nutritional recommendations that supports
participants in achieving sustained nutritional ketosis while
eating to satiety may have unique benefits in the management
of type 2 diabetes. Specifically, this study was designed to assess
the practical utility of an intensive digital intervention supported
by medical management, continuous digital health coaching,
nutrition education, behavioral support, biometric feedback,
and peer support via an online community. We refer to this
technology-enabled medical service as the Virta Clinic.
Methods
Subjects
Adults with type 2 diabetes between the ages of 21 and 65 years
were recruited via clinical referrals, media advertising, and word
of mouth in the greater Lafayette, Indiana, region. Exclusion
criteria included advanced renal, cardiac, and hepatic
dysfunction, history of ketoacidosis, dietary fat intolerance, or
pregnancy or planned pregnancy.

 The Virta Clinic
Virta utilizes a technology-enabled, full-service clinic model
for metabolic recovery from type 2 diabetes including medical
management by physicians, health coaching, nutrition and
behavior change education, biometric feedback, and peer
support. Physicians and health coaches were trained in the basic
principles of achieving and maintaining nutritional ketosis based
on previous published works [21,22,27]. In this study,
educational content was delivered via either on-site weekly
90-minute group-based classes or Web-based recorded
educational content, and participants self-selected their preferred
mode of content delivery. The same educational content was
provided by each delivery method. Educational content included
discussion of the pathophysiology of diabetes, practical
management of carbohydrate restriction while consuming protein
in moderation and increasing fat intake, the utilization of ketones
as a biofeedback mechanism, and appropriate utilization of
behavior change techniques. No modifications to participants’
physical activity were encouraged in the first 10 weeks of the
intervention.
Remote support was provided to each subject through tracking
of daily biometrics, the assignment of a personal health coach
available daily via one-on-one texting for advice and problem
solving, support via an online community of his or her peers,
and physician supervision. Subjects were instructed to monitor
and report glucose level via the Web to the care team 1-3 times
per day, and a physician made medication changes as
appropriate. Additionally, the medication status of each
participant was reviewed by the care team and the principal
investigator weekly.
Nutritional Ketosis
The 
Virta 
Clinic 
includes 
individualized 
nutritional
recommendations to sustain nutritional ketosis by titrating
carbohydrate and protein intake to the patient’s individual
tolerance [27]. With the insulin resistance characteristic of type
2 diabetes, subjects typically require total dietary carbohydrates
to be restricted to <30 g·day−1. Daily protein intake was targeted
to a level of 1.5 g·kg−1 of reference (ie, medium-frame “ideal”)
body weight and participants were coached to incorporate dietary
fats to satiety. Other aspects of the diet were individually
prescribed to ensure safety, effectiveness, and satisfaction,
including consumption of 3-5 servings of nonstarchy vegetables
and adequate mineral and fluid intake for the ketogenic state.
BOHB was monitored routinely via finger-stick blood
monitoring using a handheld device (Abbott Precision Xtra
Blood Glucose and Ketone Monitoring System, Alameda, CA,
USA) and participants were encouraged to obtain BOHB
readings ≥0.5 mmol·L−1.
Outcome Measures and Testing Procedures
Type 2 diabetes status was determined by HbA1c level at
baseline and again at 10-11 weeks into the program. A value of
6.5% or greater, or HbA1c level <6.5% but taking at least one
hypoglycemic medication, was considered indicative of type 2
diabetes. Secondary outcome measures included assessment of
(1) body weight determined daily on a cellular-connected scale
(BodyTrace BT003 cellular-connected scale, New York, New
York, USA); (2) medication use for control of diabetes; and (3)
blood pressure obtained in the seated position. Fasting blood
was analyzed for total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides,
C-reactive protein, total white blood cell count, and kidney and
liver functions. All laboratory test results were analyzed by
standard procedures. Hunger was assessed using a 4-point Likert
scale from 1 (no) to 4 (always), representing the participant’s
subjective level of hunger over the previous 24-hours.
Statistical Analysis
Descriptive statistics were calculated for each variable as mean
(SD). Baseline and 10- to 11-week follow-up measures were
compared with paired-sample t tests to evaluate for significant
differences in primary (HbA1c level) and secondary outcome
variables over time, following implementation of carbohydrate
restriction per the Virta Clinic. Statistical significance was set
a priori at P<.05; for secondary outcome variables, we applied
a Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons, setting
P<.003 as the level of significance for those outcome measures.
McNemar test with continuity correction and Bonferroni
adjustment for multiple comparisons was utilized to assess for
a difference in the proportion of participants who were
prescribed each of the 7 medication classes at baseline compared
with follow-up, setting P<.007 as the level of significance. We
utilized an intention-to-treat analysis with the last observation
carried forward for analyses of all participants; separate
subanalyses were performed for participants who completed
follow-up testing (completers). Given that 2 different modes
were utilized for delivery of educational content, we performed
a post hoc analysis on the primary outcome measure to
determine if differences existed between groups.
Institutional Review Board Approval
The protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional
Review Board at Franciscan Health Lafayette East, Lafayette,
Indiana. Subjects were informed of the purpose and possible
risks of the investigation before signing an informed consent
document approved by the institutional review board.

Retention
At 11 weeks, 21 of the 262 subjects had dropped out and 3 had
not obtained the follow-up laboratory test results, yielding 238
or 90.8% retention for this phase of the study. Among the
noncompleters, the most common reasons to leave the study
were as follows: removed for noncompliance (n=6), unrelated
health issue took priority (n=3), family illness or other issues
(n=3), cost of medical appointments (n=2), and undisclosed
personal choice (n=2). The age and sex distributions did not
differ between noncompleters and completers.
Program Adherence
Daily BOHB level averaged over 10 weeks of the program was
0.6 (SD 0.6) mmol·L−1 (see Figure 1). This range is indicative
of a modest state of nutritional ketosis in most of the subjects,
with highest value similar to levels observed during fasting.
There were no cases of diabetic ketoacidosis (ie, hyperglycemia
concurrent with serum BOHB level >6 mmol·L−1).

due to increased exercise and another (6.0 mmol•L−1) in which we suspect participant data entry error. Excluding this 1 value, average BOHB
concentrations for this participant ranged from 0.4 to 1.4 mmol•L−1.

 Hemoglobin A1c
Baseline HbA1c level was 7.6% (SD 1.5%) and 210/262 (80.2%)
participants had an HbA1c level of ≥6.5%. After 10 weeks,
HbA1c level was reduced by 1.0% (SD 1.1%; 95% CI 0.9% to
1.1%, P<.001), and 56.1% (147/262) achieved an HbA1c level
of <6.5%. HbA1c level for the 238 completers was similarly
reduced from 7.6% (SD 1.5%) at baseline to 6.5% (SD 1.0%;
95% CI of mean difference −1.2% to −1.0%, P<.001) at 10-11
weeks into the Virta Clinic program. The varying responses of
HbA1c based upon starting level are shown in Figure 2. Of the
147 participants who achieved an HbA1c level of less than 6.5%,
143 (97.3%) reached this goal without an increase in the number
or dosage of diabetes medications. At follow-up, 47.7% of
participants (125/262) achieved an HbA1c level of less than
6.5% while taking metformin only (n=86) or no diabetes
medications (n=39).
Post hoc analysis of method of educational content delivery
revealed there was no significant interaction between delivery
method and time for HbA1c (F1,260=0.18, P=.67), nor was there
an effect of delivery method (F1,260=1.503, P=.22). Baseline
HbA1c level was similar (on-site: mean 7.7%, SD 1.6%, digital:
mean 7.5%, SD 1.4%; mean difference = 0.2%, 95% CI of mean
difference: −0.2% to 0.5%; t520=0.94, P=.69), and HbA1c
reductions of 1.0% (SD 1.1%) and 1.0% (SD 1.0%) for the
on-site and digital content delivery methods, respectively, were
achieved with no difference between delivery methods at
follow-up (mean difference = 0.2%, 95% CI of mean difference:
−0.2% to 0.6%; t520=1.29, P=.39).
Figure 2. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) changes by baseline level. Error bars
represent SD; the dotted line represents the threshold for diagnosis of type
2 diabetes. Significant reductions in HbA1c level from baseline to follow-up
were observed in subjects whose baseline HbA1c level was ≥7.5% (mean
9.0%, SD 1.3% to 7.2%, SD 1.1%, P<.001) and between 6.5% and 7.4%
(mean 6.9%, SD 0.3% to 6.2%, SD 0.5%, P<.001). For those whose baseline
HbA1c level was <6.5%, HbA1c level was improved but not significantly
after correcting for multiple comparisons (mean 6.1%, SD 0.3% to 5.8%,
SD 0.4%, P=.03). *Represents significant difference from baseline.
Hypoglycemic Medications
The majority of participants (234/262, 89.3%) were taking at
least one diabetes medication at baseline. Both the number and
dosage of most diabetes medications were reduced substantially
in the first 10-11 weeks of the Virta Clinic program (Table 2,
Figure 3). As shown in Table 2, of the initial 262 subjects, 112
(42.7%) experienced a decrease in their medications with

Figure 3 shows the changes in the 7 common classes of
hypoglycemic medication prescribed to the subjects in this study.
For sulfonylureas, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors,
and thiazolidinediones, the vast majority of subjects discontinued
these medications (90.3%, 86.2%, and 75.0%, respectively). To
a lesser degree, this was also the case for dipeptidyl peptidase-4
inhibitors (56.7%), insulin (35.9%), and glucagon-like peptide-1
receptor agonists (27.9%). The exception to this trend was
metformin. The proportion of participants who were prescribed
insulin, sulfonylureas, and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2
inhibitors was significantly different at follow-up compared
with baseline (all P<.007, see Figure 3). Given the reduced risk
for hypoglycemia with the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor
agonists relative to insulin and sulfonylureas, the former was
added in some cases in order to withdraw the latter two. In the
case of metformin, given its modest but significant efficacy in
the prevention of diabetes, its continued use in this cohort was
encouraged (ie, 186 users at baseline and 181 at follow-up).

 dosage increased in order to manage their initial HbA1c value
of 8.3% (SD 0.4%). For the other 74 subjects who entered the
study while taking insulin, the HbA1c values declined
significantly despite the same, reduced, or eliminated insulin
dosages.

P<.001, respectively). Six users with no change in insulin dose achieved a reduction in HbA1c level, although it was not statistically significant (8.2%,
SD 1.8%, to 7.6%, SD 1.2%, P=.25). Despite an increased insulin dosage in 4 users, HbA1c level increased but the difference was not significant (8.3%,
SD 0.4%, to 8.7%, SD 0.8%, P=.61).
Body Weight
Weight and body mass index (BMI) changes from baseline to
10 weeks are presented in Table 1, and the mean weight change
(as percentage of starting weight) over time is shown in Figure
5 (part “a”). Figure 5 (parts “b” and “c”) also shows individual
subjects’ weight change over 10 weeks for completers and at
the time of dropout for noncompleters. Mean weight loss at 10
weeks for completers was 7.2% (SD 3.7%) of initial body
weight. Only 5 out of 262 subjects (2 completers, 3
noncompleters) registered a weight gain, and 75% of completers
lost 5% or more of their initial body weight in this time period.

testing).
Laboratory Test Results and Measures
Consistent with the HbA1c changes, the fasting glucose level
(Table 1) declined markedly despite reduced hypoglycemic
medication usage. There were no significant changes in total,
low-density lipoprotein, or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol
levels, nor were any changes made to statin prescriptions during
this time. Triglycerides were significantly reduced by 20%.
There were modest but significant reductions in both systolic
and diastolic blood pressure. Although not elevated at baseline,
the mean serum creatinine, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate
aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase levels were all
significantly reduced at 10-11 weeks. Biomarkers of
inflammation were mixed. While C-reactive protein was
unchanged, total white blood cell count decreased significantly
after 10 weeks of the ketogenic diet.
Baseline hunger on a scale from 1 (no) to 4 (always) was 1.6
(SD 0.6). At 10 weeks, subjective hunger was 1.3 (SD 0.4; 95%
CI of mean difference: −0.4 to −0.2, t134=5.58, P<.001).
Furthermore, 46/135 (34.1%) subjects at baseline reported no
hunger, increasing to 78/135 (57.8%) at 10 weeks.
Side Effects
One subject withdrew from the study in the first 70 days because
of a dietary side effect (diarrhea due to fat intolerance). There
were no serious adverse events in this time period and,
specifically, no serious symptomatic hypoglycemic events
requiring medical intervention.
Discussion
Although the American Diabetes Association has recently
relaxed its advocacy for severe dietary fat restriction, the current
paradigm for the management of type 2 diabetes is to prescribe
a diet containing about 40% of energy from carbohydrates (eg,
a Mediterranean diet) and then adjust medications as necessary
to maintain glycemic control [28]. The Virta Clinic manages

 type 2 diabetes from the perspective that it is a disease of
carbohydrate intolerance. Given that this investigation is a
nonrandomized demonstration study without measurement
against standard of care, no statistical comparisons are made.
However, these data demonstrate that when participants were
supported through a novel, individualized program including
instruction for limiting dietary carbohydrates to <30 g·day−1,
medications could be substantially reduced or eliminated in
most subjects, overall glycemic control was improved, and
clinically relevant weight loss (5% or greater) was achieved in
a majority of participants.
Other group-based and digitally delivered programs have
demonstrated improvements in HbA1c level with modest or no
reduction in weight and often without a reduction in medication.
A recent in-person group-based intervention for weight loss in
adults with type 2 diabetes reduced HbA1c level by 0.7% and
weight by 3.3% after 12-13 weeks [29], while our investigation
reduced HbA1c level by 1.0% and weight by 7.2% in 10-11
weeks. Digitally delivered programs have elicited a range of
improvements in HbA1c (from none to significant) [30];
however, these results were often achieved by increased
medication use due to improved adherence and without a
reduction in weight [31]. This study demonstrated that these
results (reduced HbA1c level, weight, and medication use) can
be achieved concurrently. Specifically, 147 (56.1%) of the initial
262 subjects in this initial study of the Virta Clinic registered
HbA1c values <6.5% at 10- to 11-week follow-up. Of these, 39
participants were able to achieve these results without taking
any diabetes medication and 86 participants were able to achieve
these results taking only metformin. Considering the
equilibration time for HbA1c is approximately 120 days, the
significant decrease after 70-77 days reported here is a
conservative estimate of the true improvement in glucose
metabolism.
Achieving an HbA1c value under 6.5% is considered “tight
control” for type 2 diabetes. There are two commonly reported
side effects of tight control—weight gain [32,33] and
symptomatic hypoglycemia [28,33,34]. Paradoxically, in this
study, we observed very consistent weight loss while observing
no severe symptomatic hypoglycemic events. In addition to the
very close mobile communication between the participant,
coach, and physician in the Virta Clinic, this absence of severe
hypoglycemic episodes despite very tight glucose control may
be due to the protection of central nervous system function by
circulating levels of BOHB. Two studies of starvation-adapted
humans have demonstrated full preservation of central nervous
system function despite profound hypoglycemia induced by
exogenous insulin administration [35,36].
As it pertains to weight loss, it is all the more interesting that
the Virta Clinic instructs its participants to strictly limit
carbohydrates and eat protein in moderation but to eat fat to
satiety. In daily Web-based questionnaires, patients reported
reduced hunger once adapted to the ketogenic diet. This
subjective decrease in hunger, albeit modest in magnitude, may
have allowed the majority of subjects to experience significant
weight loss. This concurrent combination of weight loss and
reduced hunger is particularly interesting given that significant
weight loss by caloric restriction typically increases hunger
[37]. However, in light of the recent reports of epigenetic effects
of BOHB reducing oxidative stress [24,38] and improving
insulin sensitivity [26], it is possible that these paradoxical
results can be ascribed to a combination of the metabolic and
epigenetic effects of mild nutritional ketosis.
Although we have not calculated the economic implications of
improved glycemic control with reduced medications, the
removal of diabetes medications combined with clinically
significant weight loss [39] has been shown to generate health
care cost savings. The timing of these cost savings is immediate
in the case of the medication reductions and could accrue over
time because of the effect of lowering BMI. As for the HbA1c
reduction observed in this study, when changes of this magnitude
are attained with intensive medication use, this tends to increase
both drug costs and adverse events [40]. However, given that
a 0.5% reduction in HbA1c level was associated with a 17%
reduction in diabetic vascular complications following
aggressive medication management [2], our 1.0% HbA1c level
reduction with less medication has the potential to yield even
greater savings in the cost of complications over time.
In conclusion, we demonstrated for the first time that biomarkers
of type 2 diabetes can be reversed in a substantial fraction of
participants using a comprehensive digitally delivered
intervention, including medical management by physicians,
health coaching, nutrition education emphasizing individualized
carbohydrate intake to induce nutritional ketosis, behavioral
support, biometric feedback, and peer support. In contrast to
current intensive pharmaceutical management strategies, the
positive results were achieved with less use of medication and
substantial weight loss. The brief duration of this initial study
cannot predict the long-term outcomes or sustainability of the
nutrition recommendations used by the Virta Clinic. Early results
demonstrate markedly improved glycemic control with less
medication and modest changes in blood pressure, total white
blood cell count, and liver and kidney functions. Ongoing work
will evaluate the efficacy and sustainability of this intervention
over 2 years.
