Circadian misalignment, such as in shift work, has been associated
with obesity and type 2 diabetes. However, direct effects of
circadian misalignment on skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity and
the muscle molecular circadian clock have never been studied in
humans. Here, we investigated insulin sensitivity and muscle me-
tabolism in 14 healthy young lean men [age 22.4 ± 2.8 years; body
mass index (BMI) 22.3 ± 2.1 kg/m2 (mean ± SD)] after a 3-d control
protocol and a 3.5-d misalignment protocol induced by a 12-h rapid
shift of the behavioral cycle. We show that short-term circadian mis-
alignment results in a significant decrease in muscle insulin sensitiv-
ity due to a reduced skeletal muscle nonoxidative glucose disposal
(rate of disappearance: 23.7 ± 2.4 vs. 18.4 ± 1.4 mg/kg per minute;
control vs. misalignment; P = 0.024). Fasting glucose and free fatty
acid levels as well as sleeping metabolic rate were higher during
circadian misalignment. Molecular analysis of skeletal muscle biop-
sies revealed that the molecular circadian clock was not aligned to
the inverted behavioral cycle, and transcriptome analysis revealed
the human PPAR pathway as a key player in the disturbed energy
metabolism upon circadian misalignment. Our findings may provide
a mechanism underlying the increased risk of type 2 diabetes among
shift workers.

T
he dramatic increase in the prevalence of obesity and type 2
diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is an important global health issue,
as it comes with high morbidity and mortality and poses a major
burden on health care costs. Obesity and T2DM are both strongly
associated with a westernized lifestyle of low physical activity levels
and high caloric intake. However, recently it has been recognized
that also our 24-h culture, characterized by working and eating
late, reduced sleep (quantity and quality), and excessive light ex-
posure at night, should be considered as lifestyle factors that may
negatively impact metabolic health. Indeed, epidemiologic studies
show that night work, characterized by chronic circadian mis-
alignment, is associated with adverse metabolic consequences and
increased risk to develop T2DM (1, 2). Moreover, controlled
circadian misalignment studies have demonstrated detrimental
effects on (postprandial) glucose and insulin levels, which may
indicate decreased insulin sensitivity (3, 4).
Circadian rhythmicity of metabolism is regulated by the core
molecular clock, which consists of a transcriptional-translational
feedback loop, in which the transcriptional activators BMAL1
and CLOCK induce expression of their own repressors CRY and
PER, generating ∼24-h oscillations which affect up to 40% of the
genome transcripts (5). Importantly, circadian oscillators are
present in virtually every cell of the body, including skeletal
muscle (6, 7), which is a major organ involved in the regulation
of glucose homeostasis. The circadian clock is increasingly rec-
ognized as a key regulator of many metabolic processes and
serves to anticipate metabolic challenges and demands across a
normal day (8). Importantly, systemic or localized disruption of
core clock genes in animal models has been associated with
impaired glucose metabolism and the development of mito-
chondrial dysfunction. Thus, ablation of BMAL1 in mice resul-
ted in decreased fatty acid oxidation and mitochondrial oxygen
consumption rates (9, 10). Moreover, in rodent models, insulin
resistance can be induced by liver or skeletal muscle-specific
ablation of BMAL1 (11, 12) as well as circadian misalignment
protocols (13). So far, evidence that circadian misalignment can
Significance
Shift workers are affected by circadian misalignment and have
an increased risk to develop metabolic diseases such as type 2
diabetes. Here, we show that during simulated short-term night
shift work insulin sensitivity at the level of skeletal muscle is
decreased in male volunteers, which could contribute to the
development of type 2 diabetes in the long term. We also find
that the muscle molecular clock does not align rapidly to the
new behavioral cycle. Importantly, on the level of the tran-
scriptome, circadian misalignment induced upregulation of fatty
acid metabolism pathways, potentially resulting in substrate
competition on the cellular level. These findings help to better
understand the negative consequences during night shift work.

 also affect skeletal muscle metabolism in humans is lacking. We
have previously shown that in humans, skeletal muscle is char-
acterized by a day-night rhythm in clock gene expression and
mitochondrial respiratory capacity (7). A reduction in mito-
chondrial respiratory capacity is commonly associated with
compromised insulin sensitivity (14, 15). So far it is unknown if
circadian misalignment in humans also leads to disturbed skel-
etal muscle metabolism and/or blunted insulin sensitivity.
To this end, we performed an in-depth human intervention
study in male volunteers in which insulin sensitivity—assessed by
the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp—and molecular analysis
of muscle biopsies were performed after a 3-d control protocol
(circadian alignment) and after a 3.5-d protocol in which the
behavioral cycle was abruptly shifted by 12 h, while male par-
ticipants stayed in dim light conditions to minimize shifts of the
central brain clock (circadian misalignment).
Materials and Methods
Participants. Fourteen healthy lean young men [age: 22.4 ± 2.8 y; body mass
index (BMI): 22.3 ± 2.1 kg/m2; mean ± SD] participated in the study. Partic-
ipants were nonsmokers, had no active diseases, used no medication, and
did not engage in exercise for more than 3 h per week, as verified by
questionnaires. In addition, participants reported regular bedtimes (11 PM ±
2 h), regular sleep duration of 7–9 h, did not perform shift work or travel
across more than one time zone in the last 3 mo, and were not definite
morning larks or night owls, assessed with a Morningness-Eveningness
Questionnaire Self Assessment (MEQ-SA: 54 ± 7, mean ± SD). The study
was conducted in accordance with the principles of the declaration of Helsinki
and approved by the Ethics Committee of the Maastricht University Medical
Center. All participants provided written informed consent. The study was
registered at https://clinicaltrials.gov with identifier NCT02580513.
Study Conditions. Seven days before the study periods, participants were
instructed to maintain a standardized normal lifestyle, including (trying to)
sleep and consuming meals at regular times, consistent with the times during
the study. In addition, participants were asked to abstain from consumption
of caffeine and alcohol during those 7 d. Each participant underwent one
control protocol and one circadian misalignment protocol, in a randomized,
crossover fashion, with a wash-out of 4–10 wk (mean 6.5 vs. 6.8 wk, for those
starting with control vs. misalignment). Participants resided in a respiration
chamber: a small room with a bed, toilet, TV, and computer. Light exposure
was 4 lx (horizontal angle of gaze) during wake episodes and darkness
during sleep opportunities. Participants did not have access to devices that
can display time (e.g., mobile phone), Internet, live television, or radio.
Study Design. The study design is graphically depicted in Fig. 1. For the control
period, participants were admitted to the research unit at 7:45 PM on day 1
and stayed until 5 PM on day 4. Sleep opportunities were from 11 PM until
7 AM, during which participants were required to switch off the lights and try
to sleep. Participants were not allowed to switch on the lights or get out of bed
during sleep opportunities, except for toilet breaks, and were not allowed to
sleep during wake periods. Adherence to the protocol was checked by visual
inspection at least every 15–20 min at all times. If participants had difficulties to
stay awake during the biological night in the misaligned condition, researchers
initiated conversations to promote wakefulness and supervision was in-
tensified. During the test days (except for the last test day), participants re-
ceived breakfast, lunch, a snack, and dinner (see below) at fixed times (8 AM,
12:30 PM, 3 PM, and 8 PM, respectively). To prevent sedentary behavior in our
small-sized room calorimeters, participants were instructed to perform a low-
intensity physical activity, consisting of 3 × 5 min of stepping exercises and 3 ×
5 min of standing in an alternating pattern, 1 h after each meal. In the mis-
aligned period, participants were admitted at 7:45 PM on day 1 and had a
normal sleeping opportunity from 11 PM until 7 AM. On day 2, circadian
misalignment was imposed by shifting the behavioral cycle by 12 h. Participants
were instructed to switch off the lights, remain lying in bed and try to sleep
from 3 PM until 7 PM. At 7 PM participants started a new behavioral morning
with all study procedures equal to the control period but shifted by 12 h.
Study Meals. Two days before and during the study, participants were pro-
vided with standardized meals. Caloric requirements for the study days were
estimated by multiplying sleeping metabolic rate as measured in the first
night of each condition with an activity factor of 1.5. Caloric intake was
spread over three daily meals and a snack. Breakfast accounted for ∼20
energy%, lunch for ∼25 energy%, a snack for ∼10 energy%, and dinner
for ∼45 energy%. Daily macronutrient distribution was ∼52 energy% as
carbohydrates, ∼31 energy% as fat (∼9% saturated), and ∼14 energy% as
protein. Breakfast and lunch were bread meals, while dinner was a hot meal,
resulting in a relatively higher fat content for dinner, as is common in The
Netherlands. No additional snacks or drinks other than water were provided.
Indirect Calorimetry. Whole-body energy expenditure and substrate metab-
olism were measured with an automated respiratory gas analyzer using a
ventilated hood system and whole-room calorimeter (Omnical; Maastricht
Instruments). Sleeping metabolic rate was assed as the lowest 3-h mean
energy expenditure of the sleep period and extrapolated to 24-h energy
expenditure (7).
Skeletal Muscle Biopsies. During each study period, two skeletal muscle bi-
opsies were obtained, at 8 AM and 8 PM from the m. vastus lateralis under
local anesthesia (1% lidocaine, without epinephrine). Successive biopsies
were taken moving from distal to proximal. The leg of the first biopsy during
the first study condition was randomized, and the next biopsy was taken from
the other leg, alternating between left and right leg (7).
Gene Transcript Quantification and Microarray Processing. RNA was isolated
from 50 mg of muscle material as described previously (7). Total RNA (100 ng) was
labeled with the Whole-Transcript Sense Target Assay (P/N 900652; Affymetrix-
ThermoFisher Scientific) and hybridized to whole-genome Affymetrix Human
Gene 2.1 ST arrays. Detailed information can be found in the SI Appendix.
Two-Step Hyperinsulinemic Euglycemic Clamp. To determine insulin sensitivity,
a two-step hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp with infusion of D-[6,6-2H2]glucose
tracer was performed. Insulin was infused at 10 mU/m2 per min for 3 h to assess
hepatic insulin sensitivity [suppression of endogenous glucose production (EGP)
by insulin] and subsequently at 40 mU/m2 per min for 2 h to determine rate of
disappearance of glucose, mainly reflecting muscle insulin sensitivity (glucose Rd).
Detailed information can be found in the SI Appendix.
Statistics. Data are presented as mean ± SEM unless indicated otherwise.
Statistical analyses were performed with the use of IBM Statistical Package
for Social Sciences for MAC, version 23 (SPSS, Inc.). The effect of circadian
misalignment on outcome variables was assessed by paired samples t test.
Statistical significance was defined as a P < 0.05.

12-H Rapid Shift in Behavior Induces Circadian Misalignment. In the
current study, we used a rapid 12-h shift protocol to induce
circadian misalignment modeled after ref. 3. To confirm that also
in the current study the volunteers were in circadian mis-
alignment, we recorded core body temperature (CBT). As can be
seen in SI Appendix, Fig. S1, CBT follows a classical 24-h rhythm

 during the control protocol, with a decrease in the late evening.
During circadian misalignment, CBT decreased in the late bi-
ological evening despite subjects remaining awake, indicating
that the shifted behavioral cycle was misaligned relative to the
central circadian clock (SI Appendix, Fig. S1B).
Circadian Misalignment Increases Sleeping Metabolic Rate. To ex-
amine if circadian misalignment of body temperature was also
reflected in alterations in energy expenditure, we determined
whole-body sleeping metabolic rate (SMR). Consistent with
higher body temperature during sleep, SMR was elevated during
circadian misalignment compared with the control condition
(4.96 ± 0.12 vs. 5.16 ± 0.15 kJ/min, control vs. misalignment P =
0.014, SI Appendix, Fig. S2 A and C). Substrate oxidation during
sleep was not affected by circadian alignment (RER: 0.83 ± 0.01
vs. 0.84 ± 0.01, control vs. misalignment, P = 0.687, SI Appendix,
Fig. S2B). Radar counts from the respiration chamber during the
sleeping period were not different between control and mis-
aligned condition [average (±SEM) for control: 26.3 ± 1.2 vs.
misaligned 28.1 ± 3.1 counts, P = 0.470]. Body weight, which is a
determinant of SMR, was not different between control and
misalignment (74 ± 12 vs. 74 ± 12 kg, P = 0.915).
Circadian Misalignment Alters Fasting Plasma Metabolites. We next
investigated the effect of circadian misalignment on plasma
substrate values taken after an “overnight” fast and predinner, at
7 AM and 7 PM in the control and misaligned condition (Fig. 2).
Plasma glucose levels were increased during circadian mis-
alignment in the biological evening, i.e., at 7 PM (control: 5.0 ±
0.1 and 5.0 ± 0.1 mmol/L, 7 AM and 7 PM; misalignment: 5.1 ±
0.1 and 5.2 ± 0.1 mmol/L, 7 AM and 7 PM P = 0.015, Fig. 2A),
while insulin levels were not statistically changed (control: 12.0 ±
1.1 and 7.4 ± 0.7 μU/mL, 7 AM and 7 PM; misalignment: 9.0 ±
1.0 and 10.9 ± 1.0 μU/mL, 7 AM and 7 PM P = 0.209, Fig. 2B).
Plasma free fatty acid (FFA) levels were however markedly in-
creased during circadian misalignment, with higher FFA levels
in the biological evening after an 11-h overnight fast (7 PM in
circadian misalignment) (control: 389 ± 47 and 433 ± 51 μmol/L,
7 AM and 7 PM; misalignment: 363 ± 50 and 525 ± 48 μmol/L,
7 AM and 7 PM P = 0.006, Fig. 2C). Also, plasma triglyceride
levels showed a more pronounced evening-morning variation
after circadian misalignment, with lower triglyceride (TG) levels
in the biological evening after an overnight fast (control: 0.76 ±
0.05 and 0.74 ± 0.06 mmol/l, 7 AM and 7 PM; misaligned: 0.87 ±
0.09 and 0.60 ± 0.04 mmol/l, 7 AM and 7 PM P = 0.004, Fig. 2D).
Circadian Misalignment Decreases Insulin Sensitivity. We next in-
vestigated if the changes in plasma metabolites upon circadian
misalignment were accompanied by a reduction in insulin sen-
sitivity. To this end, we performed a two-step hyperinsulinemic
euglycemic clamp after an overnight fast, either at 8 AM or 8 PM
in the control and misaligned condition, respectively. During
low-dose insulin stimulation, EGP (2.2 ± 0.3 vs. 2.4 ± 0.2 μmol/kg
per min, control vs. misalignment, P = 0.424) or the relative
suppression of EGP (Fig. 3A, P = 0.309) was not affected
by circadian misalignment. This suggests that circadian mis-
alignment had no effect on hepatic insulin sensitivity. During
high insulin infusion, EGP was fully suppressed in both study
conditions, further supporting a lack of effect of circadian mis-
alignment on hepatic insulin sensitivity. In contrast, circadian
misalignment resulted in a ∼14% lower insulin-stimulated glu-
cose disposal, mainly reflecting muscle insulin sensitivity, during
high insulin infusion (delta Rd: 35.2 ± 2.4 vs. 30.3 ± 1.3 μmol/kg
per min, control vs. misalignment P = 0.029, Fig. 3B). The de-
crease in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was not accounted for
by reduced glucose oxidation (delta glucose oxidation: 11.2 ± 0.8
vs. 11.9 ± 1.1 μmol/kg per min, control vs. misalignment, P =
0.583, Fig. 3C). However, nonoxidative glucose disposal was
∼23% lower upon circadian misalignment, suggesting decreased
ability to form glycogen (delta NOGD: 23.7 ± 2.4 vs. 18.4 ±
1.4 μmol/kg per min, control vs. misalignment P = 0.024, Fig. 3D)
(16). Free fatty acid levels decreased during the clamp from 386 ± 36
Fig. 2.
Plasma metabolites are altered in circadian misalignment. Plasma
glucose (A), insulin (B), free fatty acids (C), and triglycerides (D) were mea-
sured in the evening before dinner (nonfasted) and in the overnight fasted
state 15 min after awaking, 7 AM and 7 PM in the control and misalignment
condition, respectively. Data are mean ± SEM. *P < 0.05 biological morning
and evening; #P < 0.05 behavioral morning and evening.

steady states. Data are mean ± SEM. Rd, rate of disappearance. *P < 0.05.

 vs. 521 ± 43 μmol/L (control vs. misalignment P < 0.001) in the basal
state to 74 ± 11 vs. 81 ± 12 μmol/L, (P = 0.422) upon low insulin and
to 23 ± 2 vs. 26 ± 3 μmol/L (P = 0.456) upon high insulin infusion.
We next performed analysis in skeletal muscle biopsies to investigate
the mechanisms potentially underlying the reduction in skeletal
muscle insulin sensitivity.
The Core Skeletal Muscle Molecular Clock Does Not Rapidly Align to
the New Behavioral Rhythm. Given that circadian misalignment
resulted in skeletal muscle insulin resistance, we first investigated
whether circadian misalignment affected the skeletal muscle mo-
lecular clock. To this end, we performed quantitative PCR (qPCR)
analysis on muscle biopsies that were obtained at 7 AM and 7 PM
in both the control and circadian misalignment condition. In the
control condition, the core clock genes BMAL1, CRY1, and PER2
displayed diurnal differences in mRNA expression levels, concor-
dant with the results from our previous study (7) (Fig. 4). In-
triguingly, upon circadian misalignment, mRNA expression levels
of the core clock genes kept the same diurnal pattern as in the
control condition, albeit blunted for PER and CRY, indicating that
the core molecular clock in skeletal muscle indeed was misaligned
relative to the inverted behavioral cycle.
Mitochondrial Oxidative Capacity Is Elevated upon Circadian
Misalignment. A reduced mitochondrial function has also been
suggested as a determinant of skeletal muscle insulin resistance
(15). Therefore, we measured ex vivo mitochondrial oxidative
capacity using high-resolution respirometry in muscle fibers
obtained at 7 AM and 7 PM in both the control and circadian
misalignment condition. ADP-stimulated mitochondrial respira-
tion (state 3) upon pyruvate as a substrate was not significantly
different between evening and morning in the control condition
(state 3 MP: 65.6 ± 4.4 and 71.0 ± 5.1 pmol/mg per s in control
condition at 7 AM and 7 PM, P = 0.198, SI Appendix, Fig. S3A).
However, upon circadian misalignment, state 3 respiration was
higher at 7 PM (i.e., the behavioral morning) compared with 7 AM
(state 3 MP: 69.3 ± 4.3 and 78.9 ± 5.8 pmol/mg per s, misaligned
condition at 7 AM and 7 PM, P = 0.015, SI Appendix, Fig. S3A).
Similar results were observed for pyruvate-fueled state U respi-
ration (SI Appendix, Fig. S3A). As a result, state 3 and state U
respiration was higher upon circadian misalignment when mea-
sured in the overnight fasted state (state 3 MP: P = 0.034). ADP-
stimulated mitochondrial respiration (state 3) and uncoupled
respiration (state U) upon octanoylcarnitine as a substrate did not
show morning-evening variation, neither in the control nor in the
misalignment condition (SI Appendix, Fig. S3B). Please note that
oxidation of octanoylcarnitine is not dependent on CPT1 activity
or proximal metabolism of fatty acids. Differences in mitochon-
drial oxidative capacity did not originate from mitochondrial
content, as revealed by the absence of significant changes in mi-
tochondrial protein content (4.95 ± 0.42 and 4.94 ± 0.34 AU,
7 AM and 7 PM vs. 5.03 ± 0.51 and 5.29 ± 0.49 AU, 7 AM and
7 PM, control vs. misalignment P ≥ 0.05). Muscle fiber type
proved to be similar between control and misalignment condition.
Microarray Analysis Reveals Induction of PPAR-Mediated Oxidative
Gene Expression upon Circadian Misalignment. To further in-
vestigate the potential molecular mechanism underlying the dif-
ference in insulin sensitivity, we performed whole genome
expression profiling on the muscle biopsies taken in the evening
and morning of both conditions. Multilevel partial least squares-
discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) showed that based on the global
gene expression profiles, samples separated into four clusters that
well represented the four conditions (i.e., 7 AM and 7 PM of the
control condition and circadian misalignment) (Fig. 5A). In-
terestingly, the shift in the clustering of gene expression profiles
from 7 AM to 7 PM (biological morning to biological evening) was
clearly distinct in the control condition compared with the mis-
aligned condition (Fig. 5A, arrows), which suggests (only) partial
adaptation to the new (misaligned) behavioral cycle. A similar
conclusion was reached when depicting the gene expression
changes in a scatter plot (SI Appendix, Fig. S4). Correlation
analysis indicated that on average the diurnal expression tended to
have a reversed expression pattern in the misaligned condition
compared with the control condition, suggesting partial rather
than complete adaptation to the inverted behavioral cycle of the
subjects. Clock-related genes that display a circadian rhythm tend
to align into an opposite direction compared with the regression
line, i.e., they have not aligned to the inverted behavioral cycle.
These data thus confirm the data from the exploratory qPCR
analysis, that several clock genes did not reverse their expression
patterns during circadian misalignment [BMAL1 (ARNTL), PER1/
2/3, and CIART]. This was a very consistent response in all of the
subjects (SI Appendix, Fig. S5). At the level of individual genes,
several ones were identified that exhibited diurnal differences
between 7 AM and 7 PM in the control condition [296 genes, false
discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05] and during circadian misalignment
(238 genes, FDR < 0.05). To better characterize the potential
functional implications of the differences in gene expression, we
performed pathway analysis in the form of gene set enrichment
analysis, comparing 7 AM with 7 PM in both the control and
misaligned condition. Interestingly, many of the most highly
enriched gene sets among the genes changed in expression from
7 AM to 7 PM in the misaligned condition were related to fatty
acid metabolism and PPAR signaling. This observation indicates
that fatty acid metabolism and PPAR signaling are most strongly
increased from 7 AM to 7 PM in the misaligned condition (SI
Appendix, Fig. S6A). Since insulin sensitivity was only determined
once in each study condition, after the overnight fasts at 7 AM
(control) and 7 PM (misaligned) respectively, we next compared
Fig. 4.
Skeletal muscle core molecular clock genes are not aligned to be-
havioral rhythm upon circadian misalignment. mRNA expression levels of the
core molecular clock genes BMAL1 (A), CLOCK (B), PER2 (C), and CRY1 (D) in

points per arm were investigated, the lack of difference in mRNA expression
levels between 7 AM and 7 PM does not provide evidence that the measured
parameter lacks 24 h rhythmicity.

 the changed pathways between 7 AM in the control condition and
7 PM in the misaligned condition, representing the timepoints of
the clamp. Again, fatty acid metabolism and PPAR signaling fea-
tured prominently among the most significantly changed pathways
(SI Appendix, Fig. S6B). The functional role in lipid metabolism of
the positively enriched genes in the geneset “human PPAR tar-
gets” is illustrated in Fig. 5B. Interestingly, pathways involved in
glucose metabolism were not changed by circadian misalignment.
These data suggest that upon circadian misalignment, lipid me-
tabolism is induced in the behavioral morning compared with the
control condition.
Discussion
A substantial part of the working population is engaged in shift
work, which is associated with metabolic diseases. Here, we show
in male volunteers that short-term circadian misalignment
resulted in a significant decrease in insulin sensitivity that was
mainly due to impairment in insulin-stimulated nonoxidative
glucose disposal, but not hepatic insulin sensitivity. In addition,
we show that the molecular biological clock in skeletal muscle
was misaligned relative to the behavioral routine, suggesting that
skeletal muscle does not adjust to a new day-night rhythm within
3 d. Interestingly, this was accompanied by an enriched molec-
ular PPAR and fat (oxidative) metabolism signature, which may
suggest a role for substrate competition at the level of the skel-
etal muscle in the induction of compromised skeletal muscle
insulin sensitivity.
Controlled circadian misalignment decreased insulin sensitivity
and was accompanied by an increase in fasting plasma glucose
levels. This finding corroborates indirect observations from earlier
studies, demonstrating higher plasma glucose levels after a meal,
despite concomitantly increased levels of plasma insulin (3, 17),
during circadian misalignment. Also, Sharma et al. (18) recently
reported that postprandial glycemic excursion was higher after
night shift in shift workers, due to impaired β-cell function. It has
been suggested that eating at the wrong time is an important as-
pect in shift work conditions (19) and may be one explanation for
our results. Our findings are also in line with the finding that in-
sulin sensitivity is typically reduced in the evening (20). In-
terestingly, we here find that the decrease in insulin sensitivity
under misaligned conditions was not due to a reduction in hepatic
insulin sensitivity, as the suppression of hepatic glucose output
upon physiological concentrations of insulin (10 mU/m2 per min
infusion) was similar in both study conditions, indicating that he-
patic insulin sensitivity is not affected during short-term circadian
misalignment. In fact, the decrease in insulin sensitivity could be
completely attributed to a 23% decrease in insulin-stimulated
nonoxidative glucose disposal (NOGD).
Circadian misalignment also led to higher fasting FFA levels
and lower triglyceride levels. Notably, elevated fasting glucose
and FFA levels are important markers in the development of
prediabetes and point toward a disturbed glucose homeostasis
(21). The increase in fasting FFA with circadian misalignment is
consistent with previous findings by Morris et al. (3) and suggests
that basal rates of lipolysis display intrinsic circadian rhythmicity,
as has also been shown in mice (22). Moreover, a recent human
trial showed that the adipose tissue molecular clock responds to
delayed meal timing with a shift in circadian phase (23). We also
found altered triglyceride levels in circadian misalignment, which
can be due to intrinsic circadian regulation and/or elevated
clearance of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)-TG by the
skeletal muscle. In fasted rats, VLDL levels are lower during the
active phase compared with the resting phase (24); however,
human data in support of such regulation is lacking. Together,
these results highlight the negative consequences of a short-term
circadian misalignment.
We also found significantly higher SMR and a tendency for
higher resting energy metabolism in the misaligned condition.
These results are in line with a previous report of higher SMR
after 3 d of circadian misalignment, induced by an artificial 27-h
forced desynchrony protocol (25), but contrast with a recent
report by McHill et al. (26). The reason for the different results
are unclear. Importantly, we noted that energy expenditure was
consistently higher (and very stable) throughout the entire
sleeping period after circadian misalignment (SI Appendix, Fig.
S1C). This fits well with the higher body temperature during the
night upon misalignment. Although an elevation of energy me-
tabolism may seem beneficial in the context of body weight
regulation, improvements in metabolic health are usually char-
acterized by reductions in energy metabolism, due to improved
energy efficiency (27). Therefore, most likely the increase in
sleeping metabolic rate is another indicator for an unfavorable
metabolic profile during circadian misalignment.
Analysis of gene expression in skeletal muscle clearly showed
that in this 3-d circadian misalignment protocol the molecular
clock gene pathway had not adapted to the behavioral rhythm
(i.e., the new day-night rhythm). We here demonstrate that in
humans, upon short-term misalignment, the molecular clock in

 skeletal muscle does not realign to the new behavior. From
preclinical studies, it is assumed that the skeletal molecular clock
can be affected by behavioral factors such as food intake and
exercise (28). Future studies are needed to investigate whether
the muscle molecular clock can be realigned to the new behav-
ioral rhythm via interventions with food intake or physical ac-
tivity. A more global analysis of gene transcripts showed that the
vast majority of gene transcripts with diurnal expression differ-
ences in the control condition show a tendency toward reversed
expression in circadian misalignment and are thus not aligned to
the new behavioral rhythm. Interestingly, pathway analysis
revealed that particularly genes involved in lipid metabolism
were affected by circadian misalignment. Analysis of the most
significantly up-regulated genes upon circadian misalignment
revealed a clear PPAR signature, accompanied by markers of
elevated (fat) oxidative gene transcription. Consistent with a role
for PPAR in the regulation of this gene program, genes involved
in glucose oxidation were not affected. These findings are in line
with a recent report showing that PPARδ overexpression in mice
specifically affects cellular substrate choice by favoring fat oxi-
dation over glucose and glycogen usage (29). The finding that
specifically insulin-induced glycogen storage was reduced upon
circadian misalignment fits with the concept that PPAR activation
may have spared glycogen usage, similar as in mice overexpressing
PPARδ (29). Subsequently, this would lead to a reduced urge
to replenish glycogen stores under hyperinsulinemic euglycemic
conditions, hence the observed reduced NOGD. Higher FFA
levels measured after an overnight fast upon circadian mis-
alignment fit with this concept of substrate competition and could
then serve to fuel the muscle with fatty acid substrates. Follow-up
studies are needed to unravel whether, indeed, intracellular sub-
strate competition is responsible for the reduced insulin sensitivity
upon circadian misalignment.
Limitations of the study are that we only included male volun-
teers and have only studied the effect of a short-term, acute day-
night shift. Future studies are needed to investigate whether similar
effects are seen in women and whether the observed effects also
result in similar negative metabolic health effects under chronic
shiftwork conditions, as suggested by a recent study (30). Another
limitation is the lack of information on sleep quality, which can
decrease insulin sensitivity (31), and therefore no conclusion can
be made about the relative contribution of disturbed sleep versus
circadian misalignment on insulin sensitivity. In a similar study
protocol by Morris et al. (3), total sleep time, measured by poly-
somnography, was found to be reduced by ∼40 min. In daily
practice, individuals in circadian misalignment are usually also
affected by disturbed sleep, which thus can contribute to reduced
insulin sensitivity. However, it has been shown that a decrease in
insulin sensitivity, measured with the i.v. glucose tolerance test,
during circadian misalignment can also occur independently of
sleep loss (4).
In this study, we demonstrated that controlled short-term cir-
cadian misalignment reduced insulin sensitivity, which supports
the role of circadian disruption in the development of insulin re-
sistance and T2DM. Furthermore, we showed that the molecular
clock in skeletal muscle has not aligned to the new day-night
rhythm after 3 d of circadian misalignment, and that upon circa-
dian misalignment, a human PPAR gene profile is enhanced that
could favor intramuscular fatty acid metabolism over glucose
metabolism. Future studies should assess whether similar results
can be found in individuals at risk for the development of T2DM.
