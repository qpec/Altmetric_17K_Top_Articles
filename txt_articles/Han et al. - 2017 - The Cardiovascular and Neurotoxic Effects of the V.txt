Abstract: Fish venoms are often poorly studied, in part due to the difficulty in obtaining, extracting,
and storing them.
In this study, we characterize the cardiovascular and neurotoxic effects of
the venoms from the following six species of fish: the cartilaginous stingrays Neotrygon kuhlii
and Himantura toshi, and the bony fish Platycephalus fucus, Girella tricuspidata, Mugil cephalus, and
Dentex tumifrons. All venoms (10–100 µg/kg, i.v.), except G. tricuspidata and P. fuscus, induced a
biphasic response on mean arterial pressure (MAP) in the anesthetised rat. P. fucus venom exhibited
a hypotensive response, while venom from G. tricuspidata displayed a single depressor response.
All venoms induced cardiovascular collapse at 200 µg/kg, i.v. The in vitro neurotoxic effects of
venom were examined using the chick biventer cervicis nerve-muscle (CBCNM) preparation. N. kuhlii,
H. toshi, and P. fucus venoms caused concentration-dependent inhibition of indirect twitches in the
CBCNM preparation. These three venoms also inhibited responses to exogenous acetylcholine (ACh)
and carbachol (CCh), but not potassium chloride (KCl), indicating a post-synaptic mode of action.
Venom from G. tricuspidata, M. cephalus, and D. tumifrons had no significant effect on indirect twitches
or agonist responses in the CBCNM. Our results demonstrate that envenoming by these species of fish
may result in moderate cardiovascular and/or neurotoxic effects. Future studies aimed at identifying
the molecules responsible for these effects could uncover potentially novel lead compounds for future

1. Introduction
Venomous marine fish account for nearly two-thirds of the population of venomous vertebrates,
and include stingrays, scorpionfish, zebrafish, stonefish, and some species of shark, catfish, and
blenny [1–3]. Fish venoms are thought to have originated on at least 18 occasions via the process of
convergent evolution [2–4]. However, while significant research effort has focused on characterising
the biological activity of venom from terrestrial animals—particularly snakes—little is known about
the composition or biological activity of venom from many species of fish. A main reason that
these marine vertebrates remain understudied is the difficulty in obtaining, storing, and extracting
venom samples [5]. Nevertheless, marine venoms represent a diverse source of untapped biological
compounds which, when considering the utility of toxins isolated from other venomous lineages [6],
may be useful as potential research, pharmaceutical, or diagnostic tools.
The majority of venomous fish are sedentary, slow moving, and live in shallow, protected
waters [7]. Their venoms are classified as defensive, and are thought to be used much less frequently
than those employed by other venomous animals for predatory purposes [8]. Despite their extensive
taxonomic diversity at the organismal level, the venom delivery systems used by the majority of fish
are similar, and typically consist of dorsal, pectoral, and/or clitheral spines [2,3]. This is perhaps
not surprising, as the venoms are almost exclusively used for defence, and such spines are likely to
provide a degree of mechanical protection alongside the chemical defences conferred by their toxic
secretions. In addition, the pharmacological activities of fish venoms have been postulated to be
similar, despite their numerous independent origins. This is perhaps best evidenced by the clinical
effects of envenoming, which are often defined as resulting in considerable pain disproportionate to
the wound size, although a diverse array of other symptoms such as itching, erythema, and paralysis
have been described, resulting in occasional fatalities due to cardiovascular and neurological systemic
effects [9–13].
Surprisingly, little research has focused on the pharmacological or compositional nature of
fish venoms. One exception to this is that of the stonefish (Synanceia spp.), which due to their
medically-important nature have been reasonably well studied in terms of their pharmacology,
epidemiology, and clinical aspects of envenoming [14–20]. In the present study, we address the
paucity of information surrounding fish venoms by investigating those secretions from a variety of
cartilaginous (the blue-spotted stingray Neotrygon kuhlii and the brown whipray Himantura toshi, both
family Dasyatidae) and bony fish (the dusky flathead Platycephalus fuscus, family Platycephalidae;
the Luderick Bream Girella tricuspidata, family Kyphosidae; the mullet Mugil cephalus, family Mugilidae;
and the yellowback seabream Dentex tumifrons, family Sparidae).
2. Results
2.1. Effects of Crude Venoms on the Cardiovascular System
Venoms of H. toshi and N. kuhlii (10–100 µg/kg, i.v.) produced a dose-dependent biphasic effect
on mean arterial pressure (MAP), consisting of a depressor response, followed by a sustained pressor
response (Figure 1a,c). Venom of P. fuscus (10–100 µg/kg, i.v.) only caused a transient depressor
response (Figure 1e). All three venoms (10–100 µg/kg, i.v.) had no significant effect on heart rate
(Figure 1b,d,f), but caused complete cardiovascular collapse in response to 200 µg/kg, i.v. (Figure 1a–f).

Interestingly, the venom of Girella tricuspidata (5 μg protein/kg, i.v.) produced a biphasic 
depressor effect consisting of a transient depressor response, followed by a sustained depressor 
response (Figure 2a), with no significant effect on HR (Figure 2b). M. cephalus (3 μg/kg, i.v.) and D. 
tumifrons (15 μg/kg, i.v.) venoms both caused an initial depressor response followed by a pressor 
response which recovered over time (Figure 2c, e). In contrast to the stingray venoms, both M. 
cephalus and D. tumifrons venoms caused small transient decreases in the heart rate of the 
anaesthetised rat (Figure 2d, f). However, these changes in HR were not significant. The vehicle 
control group (i.e., saline administration) exhibited no significant effect on either MAP or HR of the 
anaesthetized rat (data not shown).

2.2. Effects of Crude Venoms on the Chick Biventer Cervicis Nerve‐Muscle (CBCNM) Preparation  
The venom of the two stingray species—H. toshi (0.5–1 μg/mL) and N. kuhlii (1–5 μg/mL)—both 
abolished indirect twitches of the CBCNM preparation in a concentration‐dependent manner  
(Figure 3a,c). Both venoms also significantly inhibited contractile responses to acetylcholine (ACh) 
and carbachol (CCh), but had no significant effect on responses to KCl (Figure 3b,d). Similarly, 
venom from the bony fish P. fuscus (1–2 μg/mL) was also found to abolish the indirect twitches of the 
CBCNM preparation in a concentration‐dependent manner (Figure 3e), and significantly inhibited 
the contractile response to ACh and CCh, but not KCl (Figure 3f). The time taken for twitch height to 
reduce by 50% of initial (i.e., t50) in response to 1 μg/mL of N. kuhlii, H. toshi, and P. fuscus venoms 
was determined. The t50 of H. toshi venom was significantly less than that of both N. kuhlii and P. 
fuscus (p < 0.05; one‐way ANOVA; N = 4, Table 1). In contrast, G. tricuspidata, M. cephalus, and D. 
tumifrons venoms induced transient increases in indirect twitches of the CBCNM preparation (Figure 
4a, c, e), and none of these venoms significantly inhibited contractile responses to ACh, CCh, or KCl 
(Figure 4b, d, f).

response to ACh and CCh, but not KCl (Figure 3f). The time taken for twitch height to reduce by 50%
of initial (i.e., t50) in response to 1 µg/mL of N. kuhlii, H. toshi, and P. fuscus venoms was determined.
The t50 of H. toshi venom was significantly less than that of both N. kuhlii and P. fuscus (p < 0.05; one-way
ANOVA; N = 4, Table 1). In contrast, G. tricuspidata, M. cephalus, and D. tumifrons venoms induced
transient increases in indirect twitches of the CBCNM preparation (Figure 4a,c,e), and none of these
venoms significantly inhibited contractile responses to ACh, CCh, or KCl (Figure 4b,d,f).

3. Discussion 
Fish venoms show enormous diversity and complexity of pharmacologically active components 
[21]. One of the major clinical symptoms observed in humans after fish envenoming is hypotension 
with marked cardiovascular activity [11]. In this study, we have examined the effect of several fish 
venoms on the cardiovascular system of anaesthetised rats, paying particular attention to MAP and 
HR. We have also examined the in vitro neurotoxic effects of these venoms using an avian skeletal 
muscle preparation. All venoms examined had some effect on the MAP of anesthetised rats, while 
only the venoms of N. kuhlii, H. toshi, and P. fuscus displayed in vitro neurotoxicity. Interestingly, 
three of the venoms potentiated twitch height in the skeletal muscle. 
In the anesthetised rat, the venoms from N. kuhlii, H. toshi, and P. fuscus induced an initial 
decrease in MAP at concentrations of 10–100 μg/kg. In the case of P. fuscus venom, the MAP returned 
to baseline. However N. kuhlii and H. toshi venoms displayed a biphasic response characterised by an 
initial drop in blood pressure followed by a sustained pressor response. This biphasic response is 
similar to results observed in previous studies on the Scorpaeniformes Gymnapistes marmoratus, 
Pterois volitans, and Synanceia verrucosa [22–24]. The pressoric cardiovascular responses induced by 
G. marmoratus, P. volitans, and S. verrucosa venoms were thought to involve an activity dependent on 
adrenoceptors [22,25,26] and/or to be mediated by non‐adrenergic mechanisms [1,27]. Prior research 
also suggested that the depressor response induced by some fish venoms involved muscarinic

Fish venoms show enormous diversity and complexity of pharmacologically active components [21].
One of the major clinical symptoms observed in humans after fish envenoming is hypotension with

We have also examined the in vitro neurotoxic effects of these venoms using an avian skeletal muscle

venoms of N. kuhlii, H. toshi, and P. fuscus displayed in vitro neurotoxicity. Interestingly, three of the
venoms potentiated twitch height in the skeletal muscle.
In the anesthetised rat, the venoms from N. kuhlii, H. toshi, and P. fuscus induced an initial decrease
in MAP at concentrations of 10–100 µg/kg. In the case of P. fuscus venom, the MAP returned to
baseline. However N. kuhlii and H. toshi venoms displayed a biphasic response characterised by
an initial drop in blood pressure followed by a sustained pressor response. This biphasic response
is similar to results observed in previous studies on the Scorpaeniformes Gymnapistes marmoratus,
Pterois volitans, and Synanceia verrucosa [22–24]. The pressoric cardiovascular responses induced by
G. marmoratus, P. volitans, and S. verrucosa venoms were thought to involve an activity dependent on
adrenoceptors [22,25,26] and/or to be mediated by non-adrenergic mechanisms [1,27]. Prior research
 Toxins 2017, 9, 67

also suggested that the depressor response induced by some fish venoms involved muscarinic receptors
and/or nitric oxide synthesis [1,19,27–29]. All three venoms—N. kuhlii, H. toshi, and P. fuscus—induced
cardiovascular collapse at 200 µg/kg.
Our results indicate that the venom of G. tricuspidata induces a sustained drop in MAP at
concentrations as low as 5 µg/kg. The venom from M. cephalus (3 µg/kg) and D. tumifrons (15 µg/kg)
also induced a biphasic response similar to that observed after administering venom from N. kuhlii
and H. toshi. The limited supply of venom from these three species precluded us from examining
their effects at higher concentrations. However, unlike N. kuhlii and H. toshi venoms, M. cephalus and
D. tumifrons venoms had a transient negative chronotropic effect on HR, in addition to changes in blood
pressure. Previously described chronotropic responses to fish venom have been attributed to different
mechanisms, including the activity of chemical mediators in the venom [30], activity on adrenergic and
muscarinic receptors [27], or the release of endogenous autacoids in cardiac tissues [22,27,28]. Further
studies are required to determine the mechanism(s) responsible for the decrease in HR observed in
response to D. tumifrons and M. cephalus venoms.
Although cardiovascular activity is the most widely reported symptom of fish envenoming,
paralysis, muscle spasm, and prolonged weakness have also been noted in envenomed humans [31].
Consequently, we studied the effects of the above-mentioned fish venoms on the skeletal
neuromuscular junction, using the chick biventer cervicis nerve-muscle preparation. The venoms from
H. toshi, N. kuhlii, and P. fuscus induced a concentration-dependent decrease in indirect twitches of
the preparation, with abolition of twitches within 60 min at the tested concentrations. In addition,
all three venoms significantly inhibited responses to the nicotinic agonists ACh and CCh, but not
to KCl. These results are consistent with the presence of postsynaptic neurotoxins in these venoms.
Postsynaptic neurotoxins have been shown to bind with high affinity to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors
and competitively antagonise the actions of acetylcholine [32]. Similar findings have been described
from the venom of the bony fish Scatophagus argus [33]. In contrast, D. tumifrons, G. tricuspidata, and
M. cephalus venoms did not abolish indirect twitches of the chick biventer cervicis. Instead, these
venoms induced a transient potentiating effect with no significant inhibition of the contractile responses
to exogenous agonists.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the neurotoxic and cardiovascular
effects of the venoms from these six species of fish. The cardiovascular effects as indicated by changes
in MAP were apparent across all of the species tested, even at low concentrations. However, in vitro
neurotoxicity was only observed in response to H. toshi, N. kuhlii, and P. fuscus venoms. These results
corroborate other findings, suggesting that while most fish venoms are convergently functionally
similar due to shared selection pressures for their use as defensive weapons, their effects differ
quantitatively due to unique components in different venomous fish lineages [15], in addition to the
quantity of the venom delivered [31]. Due to the limited amount of pharmacological data available
for fish venoms, our results contribute significantly to our understanding of the functional activity of
bony and cartilaginous fish venoms. These results have implications spanning evolutionary theory
through to the treatment of envenomed patients.

4.1.2. Protein Extraction
The crude venom was extracted from the fish spines and cleaned as previously described [5].
A solution was prepared on ice using 3.7 g EDTA, 5 mL 200 mM PMSF, 10 mL Triton X-100, 1 L purified
water. The solution was poured over the spines and placed on a magnetic stirrer overnight (>12 h) at
4 ◦C. The solution was then centrifuged at 4500 RCF, 4 ◦C for 30 min, before 80% ammonium sulphate
saturation (~43% w/v) was added and the solution placed on a magnetic stirrer at 4 ◦C and left
overnight (>12 h). The protein-containing precipitate was then centrifuged at 4500 RCF, 4 ◦C for 30 min.
The supernatant was removed, and the protein precipitate brought up in purified water (ratio of
15 parts water to 1 part supernatant), vortexed for 2 min, followed by centrifugation at 14,000 RCF, 4 ◦C
for 30 min. Subsequently, the supernatant was diluted 1:9 with cold 1:4 acetone:methanol. The solution
was placed at −20 ◦C and allowed to precipitate overnight (>12 h). The solution was subsequently
centrifuged at 14,000 RCF, 4 ◦C for 30 min, and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was left
to evaporate at room temperature for 1 h, then resolubilised in purified water. The total protein
concentration was then measured using a Thermo Scientific Nanodrop 2000 Spectrophotometer in
A280 mode (Wilmington, DE, USA). Extracted venom proteins were stored at −80 ◦C.
4.2. Cardiovascular Assays
The effect of venom on blood pressure and heart rate was determined using the previously
described anesthetised rat preparation [34]. This procedure was approved by the Monash Animal
Research Platform (MARP) Animal Ethics Committee, Monash University, Australia MARP/2014/97
(approved in December 2014).
4.3. Neurotoxicity Assays
The in vitro neurotoxicity of venoms was tested using the chick biventer cervices nerve-muscle
preparation as described previously [35,36]. This procedure was approved by the Monash Animal
Research Platform (MARP) Animal Ethics Committee, Monash University, Australia MARP/2014/97
(approved in December 2014).
