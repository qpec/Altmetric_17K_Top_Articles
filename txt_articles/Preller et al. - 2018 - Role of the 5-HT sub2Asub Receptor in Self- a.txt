Distortions of self-experience are critical symptoms of psychiatric disorders and have detrimental effects on social interactions. In light
of the immense need for improved and targeted interventions for social impairments, it is important to better understand the neuro-
chemical substrates of social interaction abilities. We therefore investigated the pharmacological and neural correlates of self- and
other-initiated social interaction. In a double-blind, randomized, counterbalanced, crossover study 24 healthy human participants (18

Significance Statement
Distortions of self-representation and, potentially related to this, dysfunctional social cognition are central hallmarks of various
psychiatric disorders and critically impact disease development, progression, treatment, as well as real-world functioning. How-
ever, these deficits are insufficiently targeted by current treatment approaches. The administration of lysergic acid diethylamide
(LSD) in combination with functional magnetic resonance imaging and real-time eye-tracking offers the unique opportunity to
study alterations in self-experience, their relation to social cognition, and the underlying neuropharmacology. Results demon-
strate that LSD alters self-experience as well as basic social cognition processing in areas of the “social brain”. Furthermore, these
alterations are attributable to 5-HT2A receptor stimulation, thereby pinpointing toward this receptor system in the development
of pharmacotherapies for sociocognitive deficits in psychiatric disorders.
The Journal of Neuroscience, April 4, 2018 • 38(14):3603–3611 • 3603
 and intentions toward the future (Gallagher, 2000). Distortions
of self-experience, particularly of the fundamental, minimal self,
are a critical symptom of major psychiatric disorders such as de-
pression, personality disorder, and schizophrenia (Grimm et al.,
2009; Moutoussis et al., 2014b; Nordgaard and Parnas, 2014; Picard
and Friston, 2014; Gerrans, 2015).
Furthermore, the concept of the self is closely intertwined with
the concept of the other (Decety and Sommerville, 2003; Metz-
inger and Gallese, 2003). The ability to distinguish between self
and other plays a crucial role in establishing a coherent self-
representation (Moutoussis et al., 2014a,b). Moreover, impor-
tant dimensions of the self, such as awareness of individuality, are
only meaningful when considering the self in the context of the
other (Decety and Sommerville, 2003). In light of the immense
need for improved and targeted interventions for transdiagnostic
social impairments, it is important to better understand the neu-
rochemical substrates of our sense of self and social interaction
abilities, and the importance of coherence of self-experience for
social interactions (Crockett and Fehr, 2014; Schilbach, 2016).
Pharmacological neuroimaging provides the opportunity to
study specific neurotransmitter systems that are involved in psy-
chiatric disorders and lead to a mechanistic understanding of
clinically relevant processes underlying our sense of self and so-
cial cognition (Anticevic et al., 2013; Crockett and Fehr, 2014). A
unique opportunity to study the self is to identify the neuronal
correlates of pharmacologically induced altered states of con-
sciousness in which the experience of the self is temporarily al-
tered. Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is a classic hallucinogen
that transiently produces, dependent on dose, discrete to profound
changes in the sense of self, such as a loosening of self boundaries, a
state of oneness with the external world, and changes in meaning
processing and self-relevance (Geyer and Vollenweider, 2008;
Schmid et al., 2015; Preller and Vollenweider, 2016; Preller et al.,
2017). LSD has predominantly agonist activity at 5-HT2A/C,-1A/B,-6,
and -7, and dopamine (D2 and D1) receptors (Rs; Marona-
Lewicka et al., 2002; Nichols, 2004; De Gregorio et al., 2016).
Pretreatment with the selective 5-HT2A and �-adreno R antago-
nist ketanserin has been shown to block the overall subjective effects
of LSD and therefore offers the possibility to investigate the specific
contribution of the 5-HT2A R system to self-processing and its rela-
tionship to social interaction (Preller et al., 2017).
Therefore, the present study set out to investigate the role of
the 5-HT2A R system in self- and other-initiated social interaction
by combining neuroimaging with pharmacological manipula-
tions (LSD with and without ketanserin pretreatment, and pla-
cebo). The applied task was specifically designed to capture the
reciprocal and interactive nature of social encounters where
participants engage in a gaze-based interaction with an anthro-
pomorphic virtual character in real time (Schilbach et al., 2010;
Preller et al., 2014) and furthermore giving the opportunity to
investigate self- versus other-initiated interaction, as well as joint-
and non-joint attention processing. Engagement in joint at-
tention is considered to reflect our understanding of another
person’s point of view and a perquisite of advanced social skills
such as theory of mind (Charman et al., 2000; Shepherd, 2010).
Impaired joint attention processing is found in neurodevelop-
mental and psychiatric disorders (Charman, 2003; Preller et al.,
2014; Timmermans and Schilbach, 2014). Furthermore, the
5-HT system is suggested to play an important role in illnesses,
such as autism spectrum disorders, which are characterized by
deficits in joint attention execution and processing (Muller et al.,
2016; Bolis and Schilbach, 2017). We therefore hypothesized that
LSD, at the dose tested, leads to alterations in self-experience, in
particular, experiences of loosening of self-boundaries accompa-
nied by decreased differentiation between self and other, and thus
modulates the processing of self- versus other-initiated social in-
teraction. Joint attention, i.e., an integration of perspectives while
maintaining a robust sense of self can be disturbed by the loosen-
ing of self-boundaries as for instance in schizophrenia (Fuchs,
2015). Based on this line of thought, we furthermore hypothe-
sized that LSD would affect measures of joint attention both be-
haviorally as well as at the neural level in brain areas relevant for
self-processing as well as social cognition such as the precuneus
and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), temporal cortex, and me-
dial prefrontal cortex (Schilbach et al., 2012). Additionally, we
hypothesized that LSD-induced alterations of self- and social-
interaction processing would be at least partially blocked by
ketanserin.
Materials and Methods
Participants
Participants were recruited through advertisements placed in local uni-
versities. Before inclusion in the study, participants underwent a screen-
ing visit 1 week before the first test day. All included subjects were healthy
according to medical history, physical examination, blood analysis, and
electrocardiography and had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. The
Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (Sheehan et al., 1998),
the DSM-IV self-rating questionnaire for Axis-II personality disor-
ders (SCID-II; Fydrich et al., 1997), and the Hopkins Symptom
Checklist (SCL-90-R; Franke, 1995) were used to exclude subjects with
present or previous psychiatric disorders or a history of major psychiatric
disorders in first-degree relatives. Further exclusion criteria included left-
handedness, poor knowledge of the German language, cardiovascular
disease, history of head injury or neurological disorder, history of alcohol
or illicit drug dependence, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) exclusion
criteria including claustrophobia, and previous significant adverse reac-
tions to a hallucinogenic drug. Participants were asked to abstain from
the use of any prescription or illicit drugs for a minimum of 2 weeks
before the first test day and for the duration of the entire study, and to
abstain from drinking alcohol for at least 24 h before test days. Urine tests
and self-report questionnaires were used to verify the absence of drug
and alcohol use. Urine tests of all participants included in the study were
negative on screening and each test day. Urine tests were also used to
exclude pregnancy.
The initial study population consisted of 25 participants. One partic-
ipant was not able to complete the task due to technical problems with
the eye-tracker. Therefore, the data of 24 participants were included in
the statistical analyses (n � 18 males and 6 females; mean age � 25.42
years; SD � 3.69 years; range � 20–34 years). Subjects received written
and oral descriptions of the study procedures, as well as details regarding
the effects and possible risks of LSD and ketanserin treatment. All par-
ticipants provided written informed consent statements in accordance
with the Declaration of Helsinki before participation in the study. The
Swiss Federal Office of Public Health, Bern, Switzerland, authorized the
use of LSD in humans, and the study was approved by the Cantonal
Ethics Committee of Zurich. No substantial side effects were recorded.
Four participants reported transient mild headaches after drug effects
had worn off. One participant reported transient sleep disturbances for
the first 2 nights after drug administration. Participants were contacted
again 3 months after the last drug administration. No further side effects
were recorded.
Experimental design
In a double-blind, randomized, crossover design, subjects received either
(1) placebo � placebo (Pla) condition: placebo (179 mg mannitol and
1 mg Aerosil, p.o.) after pretreatment with placebo (179 mg mannitol
and 1 mg Aerosil, p.o.), (2) placebo � LSD (LSD) condition: LSD (100
�g, p.o.) after pretreatment with placebo (179 mg mannitol and 1 mg
Aerosil, p.o.), or 3) ketanserin � LSD (Ket�LSD) condition: LSD (100
�g, p.o.) after pretreatment with the 5-HT2A antagonist ketanserin (40
mg, p.o.) at three different occasions 2 weeks apart. Pretreatment with

 placebo or ketanserin occurred 60 min before treatment with placebo or
LSD. The task was conducted 310 min after treatment administration.
The 5D-ASC (a retrospective self-report questionnaire; Dittrich, 1998)
was administered to participants 720 min after drug treatment to assess
subjective experience after drug intake. Mood state was assessed using the
Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS; Watson et al., 1988).
Participants completed the PANAS 10 min before pretreatment with
placebo or ketanserin and 720 min after treatment with placebo or LSD.
At the latter time point, participants were instructed to retrospectively
rate mood state at the time of peak subjective effects. Participants were
required to abstain from smoking for at least 60 min before MRI assess-
ment and from drinking caffeine during the test day.
Social interaction task
The social interaction task was based on the procedure described in pre-
vious publications (Schilbach et al., 2010; Preller et al., 2014). Joint
attention is a central and basic element of social interaction and is estab-
lished when one person follows another person’s gaze and both attend to
the same object (Materna et al., 2008; Nummenmaa and Calder, 2009).
All participants received standardized instructions before drug adminis-
tration and before the task. They were told that they would engage in an
interactive game with another participant located in another room but
because of anonymity constraints, they would not be able to meet the
other participant in person. Further, they were instructed that they
would see male and female anthropomorphic virtual characters on the
screen to keep the sex of the other participant concealed. During the
game, they would be instructed to either lead or follow the gaze of
the virtual character to one of two objects on the screen located on the left
and right of the avatar’s face. Their gaze behavior would be tracked and
transferred to the other participant’s computer. Likewise, they would be
able to see the other participant’s gaze behavior, allowing for real-time
interaction.
The experiment comprised five experimental conditions: selfjoint,
selfnonjoint, otherjoint, othernonjoint, and a baseline condition. Each
condition was presented in blocks lasting 5 s. Each block was preceded by
an instruction screen lasting 2 s. In each condition, participants were told
to first establish “eye contact” with the other participant. During the self
condition (selfjoint and selfnonjoint), participants had to choose one of
the two objects on the screen and gaze at it. Upon fixation, the object
turned from gray to blue. Participants were instructed to maintain their
gaze on the object until the color changed back to gray (after 1500 ms).
During this time, participants were able to peripherally observe the gaze
direction of the other participant, who would either follow the gaze (joint
attention) or look at another object (nonjoint attention). The reaction of
the avatar varied on a block-by-block basis.
During the other condition (otherjoint and othernonjoint), subjects
were instructed that the other participant had to choose one of the objects
and that they had to react by either looking at the same object [joint
attention (JA)] or choose another object [nonjoint attention (NJA)]. The
instruction to establish joint or non-joint attention varied on a block-by-
block basis analogous to the self-condition. If participants reacted ac-
cording to the instructions, the object’s color changed from gray to blue.
In the baseline condition the participant was instructed to look at one of
the objects and the avatar closed his eyes after eye contact was established.
Only one interaction (establishment of eye contact, fixation of partic-
ipant and avatar on the object according to the condition, object turning
from gray to blue) per trial was possible in each condition, according to a
fast event-related design. If establishment of eye contact and fixation
on the object did not occur, the trial was counted as “error trail”.
Furthermore, two measures of latency for eye-movement were extracted:
Latency to establish eye-contact (all conditions: time of eye contact–
beginning of trial) and latency to establish JA (otherjoint condition: time
of established JA by the participant–beginning of trial). Each of the five
conditions was repeated 20 times, resulting in 100 trials presented in a
pseudorandomized order divided into two runs with 50 trials each. The
presentation of male and female virtual characters was balanced across
conditions. A fixation cross was presented between trials with a jittered
duration of 3–7 s (mean 5 s). The stimuli were presented using Presen-
tation v14.1 (Neurobehavioral Systems).
Eye tracking
MRI-compliant resonance technology eye-tracking system (NordicNeu-
roLab VisualSystem, http://www.nordicneurolab.com/) was used to re-
cord gaze directions from the right eye. The system produced real-time
output of gaze positions, which was transferred via a fast network con-
nection to another computer controlling the visual stimulation. Saccades
and fixations were detected online. The eye-tracker’s sampling rate was
60 Hz. Eye-tracking calibration was performed before data acquisition.
Gaze positions were transformed to stimulus screen coordinates using
Presentation software. Fixations were subsequently tested to see whether
they occurred in one of the fields-of-interest (FOIs): the face of the avatar
and the objects. If this was not the case, the algorithm searched for an-
other fixation. By entering the FOIs for the online analysis, the avatar’s
gaze behavior was made contingent to the participant’s fixations (Schil-
bach et al., 2010; Preller et al., 2014).
MRI data acquisition and preprocessing
Magnetic resonance data were acquired on a Philips Achieva 3.0T whole-
body scanner (Best). A 32-channel receive head coil and MultiTransmit
parallel radio frequency transmission was used. Images were acquired
using a whole-brain gradient-echoplanar imaging (EPI) sequence (repe-
tition time, 2500 ms; echo time, 27 ms; slice thickness, 3 mm; 45 axial
slices; no slice gap; field-of-view, 240 � 240 mm 2; in-plane resolution,
3 � 3 mm; sensitivity-encoding reduction factor, 2.0). Additionally,
high-resolution anatomical images (voxel size, 0.7 � 0.7 � 0.7 mm) were
acquired using a standard T1-weighted 3D magnetization prepared
rapid-acquisition with gradient echo sequence. Images were analyzed
using SPM12 (www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk; RRID:SCR_007037). Preprocess-
ing consisted of slice time correction, realignment, spatial normalization
to the standard EPI template of the Montreal Neurological Institute
(MNI), and spatial smoothing using a Gaussian kernel of 8 mm FWHM
to meet the statistical requirements of the general linear model. Head
movement did not exceed 3 mm in any participant.
Statistical analysis
Subjective effects, number of errors, and latency. The 5D-ASC comprises 94
items that are answered on visual analog scales (Dittrich et al., 2006).
Scores were calculated for 11 recently validated scales (Studerus et al.,
2010): experience of unity, spiritual experience, blissful state, insightful-
ness, disembodiment, impaired control and cognition, anxiety, complex
imagery, elementary imagery, audio-visual synesthesia, and changed
meaning of percepts. 5D-ASC score was analyzed using a repeated-
measures ANOVA with treatment condition (Pla, LSD, and Ket�LSD)
and scale as within-subject factors. PANAS score was calculated for the
positive and negative affect scales. PANAS score was analyzed using a
repeated-measures ANOVA with treatment condition (Pla, LSD, and
Ket�LSD), time (pre-drug administration and post-drug administra-
tion), and scale (positive affect and negative affect) as within-subject
factors. Number of errors (error trials) and latency measures (latency
to establish eye-contact, latency to establish JA) were analyzed using
repeated-measures ANOVAs with treatment condition (Pla, LSD, and
Ket�LSD) as within-subject factor. Significant main effects and interac-
tions were followed by Bonferroni-corrected pairwise comparisons and
simple main effects analyses, respectively. Results did not change using
Tukey–Kramer correction instead of Bonferroni. The confirmatory sta-
tistical comparisons of all data were performed with a significance level of
p � 0.05 (two-tailed test). Analyses were conducted using SPSS Statistics
21 software (IBM).
fMRI data. The experimental conditions (self-initiated joint attention,
self-initiated non-joint attention, other-initiated joint attention, other-
initiated non-joint attention, baseline) were modeled as 5 s blocks con-
volved with a canonical hemodynamic response function in the first-level
analysis for each subject. Trials without a successful object fixation were
modeled using a separate regressor of no interest. Low-frequency signal
drifts were filtered using a 128 s high-pass filter. Furthermore, six head
motion regressors (3 translation, 3 rotation) were included in each par-
ticipant’s first-level model. According to a summary statistic approach
(Worsley et al., 2002), the following contrasts were computed for each
participant: (1) self�other, (2) JA � NJA, (3) self-initiated JA � self-

 initiated NJA, and (4) other-initiated JA � other-initiated NJA. The
individual contrasts were entered into a second-level random-effects
group analysis using a paired t test for the comparison between drug
treatment conditions and a one-sample t test for the main effects. Effects
were then analyzed using small-volume correction (SVC). Because we
were particularly interested in areas related to self-processing and social
cognition due to our a priori hypothesis, four ROIs were defined based
on a previous meta-analysis (Schilbach et al., 2012): left precuneus/PCC
(x � �6, y � �54, z � 24), left superior medial gyrus/medial prefrontal
cortex (x � �2, y � 52, z � 14), right middle temporal gyrus (x � 52, y �
�62, z � 16), and left middle temporal gyrus (x � �46, y � �66, z �
18). Search volumes were defined as spheres with a 10 mm radius cen-
tered on previously reported MNI coordinates (Schilbach et al., 2012).
Peak-level familywise error corrections (FWE) were used in all SVC ROI
analyses at a threshold of p � 0.05. All reported effects represent signifi-
cant differences between drug sessions as evidenced by direct compari-
sons of drug condition. All brain coordinates are reported in the MNI
atlas space.
Correlational analysis. Correlation analyses were conducted to further
investigate the relationship between LSD-induced differences in BOLD
signal and subjective effects. In case of significant differences between
conditions, BOLD signal responses (first eigenvariate) were extracted
from the predefined ROIs applied for SVC. Pearson’s product–moment
correlations were conducted between the extracted BOLD responses in
these ROIs (Pla � LSD and Ket�LSD � LSD change scores) and the
5D-ASC scale scores (LSD condition, because 5D-ASC scores represent
percentage deviations from the normal waking state) “changed meaning
of percepts” and “experience of unity” because these scales have previ-
ously been shown to be related to alterations in social cognition (Preller
et al., 2016; Pokorny et al., 2017) and capture alterations in self-
experience such as altered relationships between the observer and the
observed objects or persons, and include the experience of oneness and
connectedness with the surroundings as well as a loss of sense of the past
and future (Studerus et al., 2010). These results were replicated by using
5D-ASC scores as covariates of interest and regressing them against the
BOLD within the selected ROIs. Furthermore, to assess the influence of
mood, changes in mood states [Pla-LSD; (Ket�LSD)-LSD] after sub-
stance administration were additionally correlated with the extracted
BOLD responses in the above described ROIs.
Results
Subjective effects
A repeated-measures ANOVA (treatment � scale) was conducted
for the retrospectively administered 5D-ASC questionnaire, and re-
vealed significant main effects for treatment (F(2,46) � 77.40, p �
0.001) and scale (F(10,230) � 16.65, p � 0.001), and a significant
interaction of treatment � scale (F(20,460) � 15.06, p � 0.001).
Bonferroni corrected simple main effect analyses showed in-
creased ratings on all 5D-ASC scales in the LSD condition com-
pared with Pla and Ket�LSD conditions (all p � 0.05) except for
the scales spiritual experience and anxiety (all p � 0.20). Pla and
LSD�Ket scores did not differ on any scale (all p � 0.90; Fig. 1A).
To investigate treatment effects on mood state, a repeated-
measures (time � treatment � scale) ANOVA for the PANAS
revealed a significant main effect for scale (F(1,23) � 232.98, p �
0.001), indicating a higher score on the positive affect scale than
on the negative affect scale, a significant main effect for treatment
(F(2,46) � 6.10, p � 0.01), and significant interactions for treat-
ment � time (F(2,46) � 20.14, p � 0.001), time � scale (F(1,23) �
11.77, p � 0.01), and treatment � time � scale (F(2,46) � 3.95,
p � 0.05). Bonferroni-corrected simple main effect analyses re-
vealed that scores on the positive and negative affect scales did not
differ between treatments before drug administration (all p �
0.9). After drug administration, score on the positive affect scale
was significantly greater in the LSD treatment condition than in
both the Pla and Ket�LSD treatment conditions (all p � 0.05),
and score on the negative affect scale was greater in the LSD
treatment condition than in the Pla treatment condition (p �
0.05). Scores did not differ between the Pla and Ket�LSD treat-
ment conditions for either the positive or negative affect scale (all
p � 0.9; Fig. 1B).

Latency
Latency to establish eye contact was not different between drug
conditions [F(2,44) � 1.30, p � 0.2; mean in seconds (SD): Pla:
0.44 (0.17); LSD: 0.50 (0.18); Ket�LSD: 0.43 (0.14)]. A signifi-

Discussion
The present study investigated the role of the 5-HT2A R system in
social interaction by combining pharmacological manipulations
with neuroimaging and real-time eye-tracking. Our results show
that LSD decreased the response to participation in self-initiated
compared with other-initiated social interaction in the PCC and
the temporal gyrus, more precisely the angular gyrus. The results
are well in line with previous studies showing that the angular
gyrus is part of the default-mode network and implicated in self-
referential processing (Blanke et al., 2002; Kim, 2010). Moreover,
the results are in line with a recent study showing that self-related
processes are driven via PCC activity (Davey et al., 2016). The
PCC has been associated with experiential self-reflection (John-
son et al., 2006), self-referential processing and the integration of
self-referential stimuli in the context of one’s own person (Northoff
etal.,2006),andautobiographicalmemoryretrieval(Maddocketal.,

Preller et al. • LSD, 5-HT2A, and Social Interaction
 2001). Additionally, the PCC is part of the so called cortical mid-
line structures, which have been identified as a component in
generating a model of the self (Northoff and Bermpohl, 2004)
and has been shown to be involved in disturbances of self-
experience in schizophrenia patients (Ebisch et al., 2014; Leech
and Sharp, 2014). The current results are consistent with previ-
ous studies showing that altered resting-state connectivity and
density in the angular gyrus and the retrosplenial cortex, a part of
the PCC, after LSD administration was related to the dissolution
of self or “ego” (Carhart-Harris et al., 2016; Tagliazucchi et al.,
2016). The current study extends these findings by demonstrat-
ing that LSD also alters self-processing during social interaction.
Furthermore, the LSD-induced decrease in BOLD signal in the
PCC compared with both Pla and Ket�LSD in the self � other
contrast was significantly correlated with the 5D-ASC scale score
“changed meaning of percepts”. This is in line with a previous
study showing that this scale was associated with psilocybin-
induced alterations in social cognition (Pokorny et al., 2017).
This scale captures the relationship between the observer and the
observed objects or the environment and therefore corroborates
that the sense of self is intertwined with the sense of our sur-
roundings and in particular other persons around us. Therefore,
the LSD-induced reduction of self-related processing seems to
decrease the differentiation between the self and other during
social interaction as indicated by a blunted differential response
to self- versus other-initiated social interaction in the PCC and
the temporal cortex. Furthermore, our results show that the
5-HT2A R plays a key role in these processes, because the LSD-
induced reduction of self-other differentiation was normalized
by ketanserin and no significant differences were found between
Ket�LSD and placebo conditions.
When comparing selfjoint � selfnonjoint, greater BOLD sig-
nal in the medial prefrontal cortex was found in the Pla condition
compared with LSD. The medial prefrontal cortex has been shown
to be involved in social cognition tasks related to joint attention,
self-knowledge, mentalizing, and “the meeting of minds”, and may
be related to monitoring one’s own emotions during social inter-
action (Amodio and Frith, 2006; Schilbach et al., 2010). However,
increased activity and hyperconnectivity of the medial prefrontal
cortex with networks related to social and self-referential cogni-
tion has been reported to be clinically relevant in depressed pa-
tients and was related to an increased self-focus in these patients
(Lemogne et al., 2012; Schilbach et al., 2014). Furthermore, com-
paring otherjoint � othernonjoint greater BOLD signal was
found in the PCC and the temporal cortex, e.g., the angular gyrus,
in the Ket�LSD condition compared with LSD. Both the PCC
and the angular gyrus have repeatedly been implicated in social
cognitive abilities, in particular in “theory of mind” (Saxe and
Kanwisher, 2003; Mar, 2011) pointing to the interconnected na-
ture of self- and other-processing. This is also reflected in the
increased latency and therefore reduced efficiency to establish
joint attention with others under LSD. In sum, the current results
suggest that LSD-induced alterations in self-experience, particu-
larly the decreased differentiation between the self and the other,
influence the processing of fundamental aspects of social interac-
tion. However, it has to be acknowledged that LSD-induced ef-
fects on joint attention processing were more subtle that its effects
on self-processing and experience.
In parallel to the blocking effect of ketanserin in the self �
other contrast, no significant differences were found between
Ket�LSD and Pla in the selfjoint � selfnonjoint and otherjoint �
othernonjoint contrasts. Furthermore, the decreased efficiency in
establishing joint attention observed in the LSD condition was
also blocked by ketanserin. These findings are in line with the
observation that the subjective effects of LSD have been fully
blocked by ketanserin in this study as well as reported previously
(Preller et al., 2017). This suggests that the 5-HT2A R plays a key
role in the processing and execution of fundamental aspects of
social interaction such as joint attention. Our findings also point
to the importance of this receptor system in psychiatric disorders
such as depression, where recovered-depressed participants on
the one hand respond appropriately to joint attention, but on the
other hand seem to not use joint attention to form trust apprais-
als of others, suggesting normal social attention but impaired
cognition about the self and trusted other (Bayliss et al., 2017).
However, because other receptors stimulated by LSD have not
been investigated in this study, it cannot be excluded that other
receptors mediate LSD-induced effects as well. Furthermore,
considering that the number of errors was not different between
drug conditions, it is unlikely that the LSD-induced alterations in
self and joint attention processing are influenced by attention.
Yet, one limitation of this study is the unequal gender distribu-
tion of 18 males and 6 females.
In summary, LSD induced a feeling of loosening of self-boun-
daries that was reflected in a reduced neural response to self-
versus other-initiated real-time social interaction. In particular,
the current data show that the PCC and the angular gyrus are
involved in providing a coherent self-representation during so-
cial interaction. Moreover, LSD altered the processing of joint
attention, a basic and vital component of social cognition, in the
medial prefrontal cortex. Additionally, using pretreatment with
ketanserin, the current study was able to identify that aberrant
5-HT2A R-mediated signaling underlies these interdependent
changes in self-processing and social cognition. On the one hand,
not being able to generate a stable self-representation, as for in-
stance in patients suffering from an incoherent self-experience
such as seen in schizophrenia, may lead to social withdrawal
(Schilbach et al., 2016). Therefore, these patients might benefit
from treatment with 5-HT2A R antagonists. On the other hand,
an increased self-focus or self-referential bias, for instance in pa-
tients with depression (Pyszczynski and Greenberg, 1987), can
also lead to social interaction difficulties (Schilbach et al., 2014),
emphasizing the potential use of 5-HT2A R agonists in the treat-
ment of patients with increased self-focus. Future research should
therefore explore the potential of 5-HT2A agonists and antagonists
respectively to improve social abilities in different patient groups.
