The microbiota, the gut, and the brain communicate through the microbiota-gut-brain
axis in a bidirectional way that involves the autonomic nervous system. The vagus nerve
(VN), the principal component of the parasympathetic nervous system, is a mixed nerve
composed of 80% afferent and 20% efferent fibers. The VN, because of its role in
interoceptive awareness, is able to sense the microbiota metabolites through its afferents,
to transfer this gut information to the central nervous system where it is integrated
in the central autonomic network, and then to generate an adapted or inappropriate
response. A cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway has been described through VN’s
fibers, which is able to dampen peripheral inflammation and to decrease intestinal
permeability, thus very probably modulating microbiota composition. Stress inhibits the
VN and has deleterious effects on the gastrointestinal tract and on the microbiota, and
is involved in the pathophysiology of gastrointestinal disorders such as irritable bowel
syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) which are both characterized by
a dysbiosis. A low vagal tone has been described in IBD and IBS patients thus favoring
peripheral inflammation. Targeting the VN, for example through VN stimulation which
has anti-inflammatory properties, would be of interest to restore homeostasis in the
microbiota-gut-brain axis.

INTRODUCTION
A huge amount of data has highlighted a potential role of microbial dysbiosis in various chronic
disorders (Lynch and Pedersen, 2016). The microbiota, the gut, and the brain communicate
through the microbiota-gut-brain axis and a perturbation of this axis is involved in the
pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disorders (Cenit et al., 2017; Kobayashi et al., 2017; Quigley,
2017). The brain and the gut communicate in a bidirectional way, through the autonomic nervous
system (ANS) and the circumventricular organs (Bonaz and Bernstein, 2013). A perturbation of
this axis is involved in the pathophysiology of gastrointestinal (GI) disorders such as irritable bowel
syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) which are biopsychosocial diseases (Mulak
and Bonaz, 2004; Porcelli, 2004; Bonaz and Bernstein, 2013; O´
swiecimska et al., 2017). The vagus
nerve (VN), the principal component of the parasympathetic nervous system, is considered as the
sixth sense (Zagon, 2001) because of its role in interoceptive awareness (Strigo and Craig, 2016;
Smith et al., 2017). The VN is able to sense the microbiota, to transfer this gut information to the

central nervous system where it is integrated, and then to
generate an adapted or inappropriate response; the latter could
perpetuate a pathological condition of the digestive tract or
favor neurodegenerative disorders (Eisenstein, 2016; Tse, 2017).
A dysbiosis is observed in IBS and IBD. However, in the context
of this axis, the question is whether it is a cause or a consequence
of an abnormal gut-brain processing. Stress, either interoceptive
or exteroceptive, is involved in the pathophysiology of IBS and
IBD and can modify the gut microbiota (O’Mahony et al., 2009;
Konturek et al., 2011; Bonaz, 2013; Barbara et al., 2014). Stress
stimulates the sympathetic nervous system while inhibiting the
VN (Porges, 1995; Sahar et al., 2001). The VN, a mixed nerve
with anti-inflammatory properties both through its afferent and
efferent fibers, is at the interface of the brain-gut axis (Bonaz
et al., 2016a,b). An abnormal vagal tone is described in IBS and
IBD (Pellissier et al., 2010, 2014). Targeting the VN could restore
homeostasis in such diseases. In particular, VN stimulation
(VNS), approved for the treatment of depression and epilepsy
(Ben-Menachem, 2001; Bonaz et al., 2013) and for its anti-
inflammatory properties (Borovikova et al., 2000a,b; Pavlov et al.,
2003), should be of interest.
HOW THE MICROBIOTA COMMUNICATES
WITH THE BRAIN?
The human gut contains 1013–1014 microorganisms, much
more than the cells of our organism, and 100 times more
genes than our genome. The weight of the microbiota
is about 1 kg in the adult. The vast majority of bacteria
resides in the colon. In healthy adults, two bacterial phyla,
Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, dominate bacterial composition,
with smaller amounts of Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and
Verrucomicrobia. Gut microbiota also contains methanogenic
archae, eucaryotes (mainly yeasts), and numerous phages
(Eckburg et al., 2005; Reyes et al., 2010). The communication
between the brain and the microbiota is bidirectional, through
multiple pathways: neural through the VN and/or spinal cord,
endocrine (through the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal, HPA,
axis), immune (cytokines), and metabolic [short chain fatty acids,
(SCFAs), tryptophan...] (Cryan and Dinan, 2012; Brookes et al.,
2013; Perez-Burgos et al., 2015; Forsythe et al., 2016; Sarkar et al.,
2016). Neuroactive compounds are released by bacteria such as γ-
aminobutyric acid (GABA), serotonin, dopamine, acetylcholine
(ACh), and essentially act locally on the enteric nervous system
i.e., the gut brain (Lyte, 2011; Sarkar et al., 2016). Some of these
compounds reach the big brain via blood and circumventricular
organs or through the VN. In this minireview, we will focus on
the involvement of the VN at the interface of the microbiota-gut-
brain axis (Figure 1).
THE VAGUS NERVE IN THE
MICROBIOTA-GUT-BRAIN AXIS
The VN contains 80 and 20% of afferent and efferent fibers
respectively (Agostoni et al., 1957) and innervates all the digestive
tract for some authors (Delmas and Laux, 1933) or until the
left colonic flexure for others (Netter, 1989). In both cases,
an interaction between VN fibers and microbiota-rich colonic
mucosa is possible.
Gut to Brain Interactions
Vagal afferent fibers are distributed to all the layers of the
digestive wall but do not cross the epithelial layer (Wang and
Powley, 2007) so that they are not in direct contact with the gut
luminal microbiota. Consequently, these fibers can sense only
indirectly microbiota signals, through the diffusion of bacterial
compounds or metabolites, or thanks to other cells located in
the epithelium that relay luminal signals. Interactions between
gut endocrine cells and vagal afferents are at the interface
of gut chemosensing (Raybould, 2010). Enteroendocrine cells
(EECs), 1% of intestinal epithelial cells, release their content
in presence of luminal carbohydrate, triglycerides, and protein
and modulate GI functions such as motility, secretion, and food
intake (Näslund and Hellström, 2007; Gunawardene et al., 2011;
Wu et al., 2013). EECs interact with vagal afferents either directly
through the release of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT)
activating 5-HT3 receptors located on vagal afferent fibers (Li
et al., 2000) or gut hormones such as cholecystokinin (CCK),
glucagon-like peptide-1, peptide YY targeting the brain through
vagal afferents which express receptors for these anorexigenic
or orexigenic (ghrelin, orexin) hormones (Strader and Woods,
2005). Brain pathways activated by these hormones have been
mapped using c-fos expression as a marker of neuronal activation
(Bonaz et al., 1993a,b). EECs detect signals from microbiota
through toll-like receptors (TLR) which recognize bacterial
products such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and others (Abreu
et al., 2005), and are expressed by EECs (Bogunovic et al., 2007),
or receptors for microbiota metabolites such as SCFAs (Samuel
et al., 2008). Thus, EECs are key players in the detection of
luminal bacterial content and bacterial products that can regulate
GI motility, secretion, food intake, through their indirect effect
on vagal afferent fibers.
In addition with cell-mediated sensing, VN can sense
microbiota signals through direct mechanisms. For instance,
SCFAs produced by the microbiota activate vagal afferent fibers
by different mechanisms depending on the compound: while
oleate, a long fatty acid, acts on vagal afferents through a CCK-
mediated mechanism, butyrate, a short fatty acid, has a direct
effect on afferent terminals (Lal et al., 2001).
In addition, TLR4 are expressed on vagal afferent fibers
(Goehler et al., 1999) and these fibers could sense bacterial
products such as LPS to activate the brain. LPS also activate
directly vagal afferent fibers at the level of the nodose ganglia
(Hosoi et al., 2005) thus explaining that subdiaphragmatic
vagotomy does not completely block brain mediated behavioral
and neural effects of peripheral LPS or interleukin-1beta
(Schwartz et al., 1997).
Powley et al. (2011) have shown that vagal afferent endings
are divided into three subtypes: villus afferent endings are
distributed at the apical tips of intestinal villi, immediately below
the epithelial wall while other types of afferent endings are
independently distributed either around the intestinal glands or

The Vagus Nerve and the Microbiota-Gut-Brain Axis
FIGURE 1 | Communication between the central nervous system and the microbiota through the vagus nerve (VN). VN afferent fibers can be stimulated by microbiota
components either directly or indirectly via gut endocrine cells (GEC). VN afferent fibers exert stimuli on the central nervous system via the central autonomic network
(CAN). VN afferent fibers are able to stimulate efferent fibers through the inflammatory reflex. VN efferent fibers can reduce digestive inflammation and reduce intestinal
permeability by tight junction reinforcement. These actions of vagal efferent fibers can indirectly modulate microbiota composition. Alongside with brain-VN-microbiota
axis exists bi-directional communication by various ways.
crypts (crypt afferent endings), immediately below the crypt-
villus junction, or along the gastric antral glands (antral gland
afferent endings) and forms terminal concentrations immediately
below the luminal epithelial wall (Figure 2). These endings are
both chemo- and mechanosensitive. Blackshaw et al. (Blackshaw
and Grundy, 1993a,b) have recorded single afferent fibers
with receptive fields in the mucosa of the upper GI tract
from the cervical VN of urethane anesthetized ferrets. Single
chemosensitive vagal afferent units supplying the gut respond
to most luminal molecules by increasing their firing rate.
They observed a broad sensitivity of mucosal afferent fibers to
luminal chemical and mechanical stimuli. Mucosal endings were
stimulated by 5-HT acting directly on afferent endings via 5-HT3
receptors.
Vagal chemoreceptors are most likely involved in the
communication between the microbiota and the brain by
sensing
SCFAs
and/or
gut
hormones
(Raybould,
2010).
Indeed,
intraduodenal
injection
of
Lactobacillus
johnsonii
enhanced gastric VN activity (Tanida et al., 2005). Healthy
mice chronically treated with Lactobacillus rhamnosus (JB-
1) presented GABA brain expression modifications which
increased in the cingulate cortex and decreased in the
hippocampus, amygdala, and locus coeruleus. These animals
had also reduced stress-induced corticosterone and anxiety-
and
depression-related
behavior.
These
effects
were
not
observed after vagotomy. Hence, L. rhamnosus have potential
therapeutic indications in stress-related disorders pointing out
the vagally-mediated microbiota effect on mood (Bravo et al.,
2011).
Using an ex vivo intestinal jejunal segment mesenteric nerve
recording preparation, Perez-Burgos et al. (2013) have shown
that administration of L. johnsonii in the lumen of this segment
induced an increase in the firing rate of vagal afferents prevented
by prior subdiaphragmatic vagotomy. As electrical stimulation of
vagal afferent fibers modifies brain concentration of serotonin,
GABA, and glutamate (Ressler and Mayberg, 2007) and is
used in the treatment of drug resistant epilepsy and depression
(Bonaz et al., 2013), this study suggests that probiotic-mediated
VN activation could have beneficial effects in these diseases.
However, as no in vivo experiment has been yet conducted, VN
afferent fiber direct stimulation by digestive microbiota is still
hypothetical.
The activation of vagal afferent fibers by microorganisms was
highlighted indirectly by the group of Mark Lyte (Gaykema et al.,
2004) using c-fos as a marker of neuronal activation to map brain
pathways activated by oral administration of Campylobacter
jejuni at subclinical doses in mice influencing behavior and
brain functions. Brain activation was observed in the nucleus
tractus solitarius (NTS), the first entrance of vagal afferents
in the brain, as well as in the widespread projections of the
NTS such as the parabrachial nucleus, PVH, amygdala which
are part of the central autonomic network (CAN) (Gaykema
et al., 2004; Goehler et al., 2005, 2008). The CAN is involved
in the autonomic, endocrine, cognitive, and behavioral response

to interoceptive and exteroceptive stimuli (Benarroch, 1993) and
appears as the relay of vagal afferents, in particular of visceral
origin, in the central nervous system (Bonaz and Bernstein,
2013).
In
addition,
Bercik
et
al.
(2011)
have
shown
that
Bifidobacterium longum has anxiolytic effects during non-
infectious, chronic, low-grade gut inflammation induced by
dextran sodium sulfate administration. This effect required
vagal integrity, and was probably mediated by vagal pathways
originating at the level of the enteric nervous system.
Bellono et al. (2017) have recently detailed the mechanisms
involved in the communication between gut epithelial cells,
particularly EECs, and the neural system by generating
murine intestinal organoids where EECs were genetically
tagged with green fluorescence protein to characterize their
physiologic, pharmacologic, and molecular functions through
electrophysiological analysis. They showed that EECs are
excitable
and
express
voltage-gated
sodium
and
calcium
channels. They screened 30 compounds present in the gut
such
as
microbial
products,
irritants
and
inflammatory
agents, and neurotransmitters. They showed that only allyl
isothiocyanate, a mustard plant component that induces visceral
inflammatory pain, isovalertate, a volatile fatty acid fermentation
product produced by gut microbiota associated with GI
disorders, and the catecholamines (dopamine, epinephrine,
and norepinephrine), involved in GI stress, specifically activate
EECs. Isobutyrate and butyrate elicited small but consistent
responses. They showed that EECs express sensory receptors,
which detect and transduce specific signals, such as transient
receptor potential cation channel A1, an irritant receptor for
allylisothiocyanate, the olfactory receptor 558 which serves as
a microbial metabolite sensor activated by isovalerate, and an
α2A adrenoreceptor-TRPC4 channel signaling cascade that
detects stress response-related catecholamines. Using imaging
of intestinal preparations, they showed that many 5-HT3R-
expressing fibers, colocalized with synaptic markers thus of
neural origin, innervate gut epithelium and make close contacts
with EECs. By recording mechanosensory nerve fibers from an
ex vivo colonic preparation, they showed that noradrenaline or
isovalerate applicated to the epithelium induced responses in
the sensory neurons dependent on EEC-mediated transduction
through 5-HT3 receptors. They concluded that EECs are
polymodal chemosensors that integrate extrinsic and intrinsic
signals within the gut and convey this information to the nervous
system. These data have potential therapeutic implications in the
domain of IBS and IBD. In this study, they did not characterize
nerve fibers in close contact with EECs but sympathetic and vagal
sensory fibers communicate with EECs (Williams et al., 2016).
Serotonin released by EECs may also act on enteric neurons
(Veiga-Fernandes and Mucida, 2016). Together, communication
between bacterial products and the VN seems possible, but
does not necessarily happen permanently during physiological
conditions.
Non-vagal pathways are also involved in the microbiota-gut-
brain axis (Mayer et al., 2015). For instance, van der Kleij et al.
(2008) showed the protective effects of Lactobacillus reuteri and
Bifidobacterium infantis in a model of dextran sulfate sodium
colitis in mice after subdiaphragmatic vagotomy. Both strains

did not require the presence of an intact VN for their protective
effects.
Brain to Gut Interactions
Central vagal stimulation with a thyrotropin-releasing hormone
analog, known to activate preganglionic neurons of the dorsal
motor nucleus of the VN, activates M2 macrophages which
are in close connection with gastric cholinergic myenteric
neurons and have anti-inflammatory properties, and deactivates
pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages in the stomach which are
involved in abdominal surgery-induced gastric inflammation and
gastric ileus (Yuan and Taché, 2017). However, few objective data
are available on the pro- or anti-inflammatory role of M1 and M2
macrophages on intestinal permeability. M2 macrophages did
not play a role in the increase of intestinal permeability observed
in a model of enteric nematode infection (Notari et al., 2014). The
VN is able to inhibit M1 proinflammatory macrophages (Yuan
and Taché, 2017) and this anti-inflammatory effect could modify
intestinal permeability and/or the gut microbiota.
Vagal afferents activate vagal efferents in an inflammatory
reflex described in 2000 by the group of Tracey in a model
of septic shock and called the cholinergic anti-inflammatory
pathway (CAP) (Borovikova et al., 2000a,b; Martelli et al.,
2016). Indeed, ACh released at the distal end of vagal
efferents inhibits the release of TNFα by macrophages through
their α7nicotinicACh receptors (α7nAChR) (Wang et al.,
2003). In the same way, a vago-sympathetic pathway to
the spleen inhibiting TNFα release by splenic macrophages
has been described (Olofsson et al., 2012) and for some
authors
the
splanchnic
pathway
is
the
efferent
arm
of
the inflammatory reflex (Martelli et al., 2016). In addition,
vagal afferents, through the widespread projections of the
NTS, target the CAN which in return modulates the ANS,
through descending pathways from the PVN, A5, and C1
noradrenergic and adrenergic group respectively (Bonaz et al.,
2017). When targeting vagal afferents to the brain, the gut
microbiota could modulate this inflammatory reflex either
activating or inhibiting the VN thus being anti- or pro-
inflammatory.
The intestinal epithelium is a barrier to prevent translocation
of bacteria and other agents. Severe burn injuries in a rat
scald model injuring 35% of the total body surface area
result in intestinal barrier dysfunction due to gut ischemia
and electroacupuncture has a protective role through the
VN by decreasing intestinal permeability (Hu et al., 2013;
Wang et al., 2015). VNS increases the expression and proper
localization of tight junction proteins and decreases intestinal
epithelial permeability (Zhou et al., 2013; Van Houten et al.,
2015). In the same way, electroacupuncture prevents intestinal
barrier dysfunction following prolonged hemorrhagic shock
by decreasing intestinal permeability through a vagal anti-
inflammatory mechanism (Du et al., 2013). In the same model,
VNS had a protective effect, independent of the spleen but
involving a cholinergic nicotinic receptor since this effect
was reproduced with nicotine (Levy et al., 2013). Lipid-rich
enteral nutrition prevented intestinal barrier dysfunction in a
model of septic shock by activating the CAP through CCK
receptors; this effect was prevented by vagotomy and CCK or
nicotinic receptor antagonists (Luyer et al., 2005; de Haan et al.,
2010).
Endotoxemia following intraperitoneal LPS induces intestinal
barrier dysfunction with a decreased expression of occludin
and zonula occludens 1 with a disruption of tight junction
and increase of intestinal permeability. These effects were
prevented by VNS and dampened by pretreatment of the
animals with an α7nAChR antagonist before VNS (Zhou et al.,
2013). VNS also prevents burn-induced intestinal permeability
by improving tight junction protein expression of occludin
(Costantini et al., 2010; Krzyzaniak et al., 2011). The α7nAChR
protects against burn-induced gut barrier injury by preventing
the decreased expression and altered localization of occludin
and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) (Costantini et al., 2012).
The mechanism through which vagal efferents protect barrier
epithelium is not well-known. One of the mechanisms could
be the connection of the VN with the enteric nervous system
which communicates with enteric glia cells through nicotinic
cholinergic signaling (Cheadle et al., 2014). These glia cells
preserve epithelial barrier against intestinal bacteria insult by
increasing the expression of tight junction proteins such as
occludin and ZO-1 through the secretion of S-nitrosoglutathione
(Yu and Li, 2014). However, a recent study has shown that
enteric glia is not required for maintenance of the intestinal
epithelium (Rao et al., 2017). Consequently, vagal activity
provides a protective function to the intestinal epithelial barrier
and a low vagal activity makes intestinal epithelium more
permeable thus promoting systemic inflammation and chronic
disease.
There are presently no published data regarding the effect
of vagal stimulation either chemically or through VNS on
the gut microbiota but based on its effect on intestinal
permeability and local immunity (Meregnani et al., 2011), we
can hypothesize that the VN could modulate gut microbiota
composition that depends on these two factors (Karl et al.,
2017).
STRESS, VAGUS NERVE, AND THE
MICROBIOTA
The effect of stress on the GI tract is well-known (Taché and
Bonaz, 2007). Stress, through its neuromediators, corticotrophin-
releasing factor (CRF) and its related peptide urocortin(s), acting
on their G protein coupled CRF (1 and 2) receptors located
in the brain and the GI tract, increases intestinal permeability
and modifies the gut microbiota (Taché et al., 2018); these two
factors are involved in the pathophysiology of IBS and IBD.
CRF2 receptors are involved in the perturbation of intestinal
permeability (Ducarouge et al., 2017). CRF and urocortin are
released by mastocytes of the lamina propria which have CRF1-
2 receptors, activation of which releases cytokines and other
pro-inflammatory mediators by mastocytes (Theoharides and
Cochrane, 2004; Theoharides et al., 2004). CRF also increases
intestinal permeability via mast cell release of tumor necrosis
factor (TNF)-α and proteases (Overman et al., 2012). Targeting

The Vagus Nerve and the Microbiota-Gut-Brain Axis
CRF receptors by selective antagonists to inhibit mast cell
activation is a therapeutic option for chronic inflammatory
disorders exacerbated by stress. Chronic early life stress induces
dysbiosis in rats via modifications of intestinal permeability,
which may later sensitize adult rats to visceral hypersensitivity
(Moussaoui et al., 2017). Classically, stress inhibits the VN and
stimulates the sympathetic nervous system through autonomic-
related projection neurons of the PVH to the dorsal motor
nucleus of the VN and sympathetic pre-ganglionic neurons of
the spinal cord (Taché and Bonaz, 2007; Wood and Woods,
2007). Since the VN has anti-inflammatory properties through
its afferent and efferent fibers (Bonaz et al., 2016a), stress
has thus pro-inflammatory properties. A single acute stress
induces a prolonged increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines
after the end of stress exposition (Marsland et al., 2017), at
the moment of the recovery period which is a critical period
since it corresponds to the parasympathetic rebound. Exposition
to multiple repeated stressors counteracts the parasympathetic
tone recovery, favoring an allostatic load (McEwen, 2008) thus
blunting the anti-inflammatory regulatory action of the VN.
Stress could counterbalance the overall protective effect of the
VN on epithelial barrier and thus favor dysbiosis by disrupting
epithelial homeostasis.
CONCLUSION
The role of the VN in microbiota-brain communication is
now well-established. A reduction in vagal tone reflecting
dysautonomia has been shown in IBS and IBD (Pellissier et al.,
2010, 2014) characterized by a leaky gut and dysbiosis (Bonaz
et al., 2016b). Consequently, monitoring vagal tone would be
an interesting marker of the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Relevant
electrophysiological data could be then considered as a part of
the—omes, and should be integrated in a converging combined
approach to decipher complex IBD and IBS pathophysiology (de
Souza et al., 2017). Moreover, monitoring and targeting vagal
tone through VNS, microbiota modulation (using prebiotics,
probiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation, diet...), drugs
targeting the cholinergic system and/or complementary medicine
(hypnosis, meditation), cognitive behavioral therapies, deep
breathing, and moderate and sustainable physical activity would
be of interest to restore a homeostatic microbiota-gut-brain axis.
