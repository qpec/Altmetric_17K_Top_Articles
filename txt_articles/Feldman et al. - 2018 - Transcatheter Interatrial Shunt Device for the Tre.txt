ABSTRACT  
Background: In non-randomized, open-label studies, a transcatheter interatrial shunt device 
(IASD, Corvia Medical) was associated with lower pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 
(PCWP), less symptoms, and greater quality of life and exercise capacity in patients with heart 
failure (HF) and mid-range or preserved ejection fraction (EF≥40%). We conducted the first 
randomized, sham-controlled trial to evaluate the IASD in HF with EF>40%. 
Methods: REDUCE LAP-HF I was a phase 2, randomized, parallel-group, blinded multicenter 
trial in patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or ambulatory class IV HF, 
EF ≥ 40%, exercise PCWP ≥ 25 mmHg, and PCWP-right atrial pressure gradient ≥ 5 mmHg. 
Participants were randomized (1:1) to the IASD vs. a sham procedure (femoral venous access 
with intracardiac echocardiography but no IASD placement). The participants and investigators 
assessing the participants during follow-up were blinded to treatment assignment. The primary 
effectiveness endpoint was exercise PCWP at 1 month. The primary safety endpoint was major 
adverse cardiac, cerebrovascular, and renal events (MACCRE) at 1 month. PCWP during 
exercise was compared between treatment groups using a mixed effects repeated measures model 
analysis of covariance that included data from all available stages of exercise. 
Results: A total of 94 patients were enrolled, of which n=44 met inclusion/exclusion criteria and 
were randomized to the IASD (n=22) and control (n=22) groups. Mean age was 70±9 years and 
50% were female. At 1 month, the IASD resulted in a greater reduction in PCWP compared to 
sham-control (P=0.028 accounting for all stages of exercise). Peak PCWP decreased by 3.5 [SD 
6.4] mmHg in the treatment group vs. 0.5 [SD 5.0 mmHg] in the control group (P=0.14). There 
were no peri-procedural or 1-month MACCRE in the IASD group and 1 event (worsening renal 
function) in the control group (P=1.0).

Conclusions: In patients with HF and EF≥40%, IASD treatment reduces PCWP during exercise. 
Whether this mechanistic effect will translate into sustained improvements in symptoms and 
outcomes requires further evaluation.

CLINICAL PERSPECTIVE 
What Is New? 
 We report a novel therapy for patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction 
(HFpEF, EF>50%) or mid-range EF (EF 40-50%) utilizing an implanted device to create an 
atrial shunt (InterAtrial Shunt Device [IASD]).  
 The objective of the IASD is to dynamically (at rest and during exercise) decompress left 
atrial pressure overload associated with HFpEF and HFmrEF. 
 We conducted a randomized, sham-controlled trial to evaluate the mechanistic effect of the 
IASD on invasively measured pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP). At 1 month 
after randomization, the IASD treatment group had a significantly greater reduction in PCWP 
during exercise compared to the control group. In addition, PCWP during passive leg raise 
and also during 20W of exercise decreased to a greater degree in the patients randomized to 
IASD compared to sham-control. 
 
What Are the Clinical Implications? 
 In patients with HF with EF≥40% creation of an atrial shunt with the IASD unloads the left 
atrium and reduces PCWP during exercise.  
 This hemodynamic study demonstrates the beneficial mechanistic effect of IASD. 
 The IASD could have beneficial clinical effects in patients with HFpEF and HFmrEF. A 
larger trial to examine the effects of the IASD on symptoms, quality of life, exercise 
capacity, and clinical outcomes such as HF hospitalization is warranted.

INTRODUCTION 
Heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF, EF>50%), which is 
increasing in prevalence and currently accounts for approximately 50% of all HF cases, is 
associated with high morbidity and mortality, and lacks effective therapies.1,2 HF with mid-range 
EF (EF 40-50%) is also prevalent and lacks proven therapies, and was recently highlighted in the 
European Society of Cardiology HF guidelines.3,4 Although HFpEF and HF with mid-range EF 
are heterogeneous with respect to etiology and pathophysiology, elevated left atrial (LA) 
pressure at rest and/or during exertion represents a central underlying abnormality in all patients 
with these syndromes.5  
Patients with HFpEF are known to have left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction 
(impaired LV relaxation and reduced LV compliance).6,7 These abnormalities result in elevated 
LA pressure and volume overload with subsequent elevation in pulmonary venous pressures, 
particularly during exertion, resulting in symptoms of dyspnea and exercise intolerance.8 In 
addition, intrinsic LA mechanical dysfunction is increasingly recognized as potentially important 
in driving symptoms and poor outcomes in HFpEF.5,9-11 The inability of the LA to handle 
increased load during exercise is especially problematic in HFpEF patients.5,12 Pulmonary 
capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) is an invasive hemodynamic parameter that reflects LA and 
pulmonary venous pressures. Higher peak PCWP during exercise, corrected for workload, has 
also been associated with reduced exercise capacity13 and worse outcomes14 in the setting of 
HFpEF, further underscoring the importance of the LA in the pathogenesis of HFpEF.  
Given the importance of LA overload in HF—particularly HFpEF—unloading the LA 
with the goal of reducing pulmonary venous pressure may lead to improved symptoms and 
outcomes in these patients.15 It has long been known that in the setting of mitral stenosis, a 
  
6 
condition also associated with elevated LA pressure and LA dysfunction, the co-existence of a 
congenital atrial septal defect (Lutembacher syndrome) can be associated with less symptoms 
and a more favorable clinical course.16 It has been hypothesized that an interatrial septal 
communication can unload the LA in the setting of increased LA pressure (such as during 
exercise), transferring the excess LA blood volume to the larger reservoir of the right atrium 
(RA) and systemic veins, thereby limiting the increase in LA pressure and pulmonary venous 
pressures during exercise. The recognition of this concept led to the development of a novel 
interatrial shunt device (IASD, Corvia Medical) for the treatment of HF.17  
Hemodynamic simulations of IASD have shown LA unloading during exercise, without 
right ventricular (RV) pressure or volume overload.15 In non-randomized, open-label, single-arm 
studies, placement of the IASD has been associated with lowering of PCWP (a surrogate for LA 
pressure) during exercise in patients with HF and EF≥40%.18-20 In these prior studies, the IASD 
was also found to be safe and associated with fewer symptoms, better quality of life, and greater 
exercise capacity, without the development of right-sided HF or pulmonary hypertension. 
However, these were open-label, non-randomized studies that are subject to potential bias and 
confounding, and cannot prove effectiveness of the IASD. We therefore conducted a 
randomized, blinded, sham-controlled clinical trial to determine the effectiveness of the IASD in 
HF with EF≥40%. We hypothesized that the IASD reduces PCWP during exercise in patients 
with HF and EF≥40% by unloading the LA. 
 
METHODS 
Study design and participants 
  
7 
The rationale and design of the REDUCE LAP-HF I trial have been described 
previously.17 The primary objective of the REDUCE LAP-HF I clinical trial was to evaluate the 
mechanistic effect of implanting the IASD System II (Corvia Medical, Tewksbury, 
Massachusetts, USA) in HF patients with EF≥40% and elevated LA pressure who remained 
symptomatic despite optimal guideline-directed medical therapy. This was a multi-center, 
prospective, randomized, controlled, blinded trial, with non-implant (sham) control group and 
1:1 randomization. Patients were recruited between February 3, 2016 and November 23, 2016 at 
22 centers in the United States, Europe (Belgium, France, Netherlands, and United Kingdom), 
and Australia.  
A full list of inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed in the online-only Data 
Supplement. The inclusion and exclusion criteria were designed to ensure that patients had 
symptomatic HF (New York Heart Association [NYHA] class III or ambulatory class IV), an 
elevated LA pressure with a pressure gradient between the LA and RA, and no evidence of right-
sided HF. Key inclusion criteria included documented chronic symptomatic HF and (1) prior 
hospitalization for HF (or acute care facility/emergency room intensification of diuretic therapy) 
within the prior 12 months, or (2) elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal pro-
BNP (NTproBNP) within the past 6 months (BNP > 70 pg/mL in normal sinus rhythm, > 200 
pg/mL in atrial fibrillation, or NTproBNP > 200 pg/mL in normal sinus rhythm or > 600 pg/mL 
in atrial fibrillation); EF ≥ 40%; age ≥ 40 years; elevated LA pressure documented invasively by 
end-expiratory PCWP during supine bike exercise ≥ 25 mmHg, and PCWP-RA pressure (RAP) 
gradient ≥ 5 mmHg. Key exclusion criteria included stage D HF; cardiac index < 2.0 L/min/m2; 
history of stroke, transient ischemic attack, deep vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism within 
the past 6 months; hemodynamically significant valvular disease; hypertrophic or infiltrative 
  
8 
cardiomyopathy; RV dysfunction (> mild RV dysfunction, tricuspid annular plane systolic 
excursion < 1.4 cm, RV size > LV size, or RV fractional area change < 35%); resting RAP > 14 
mmHg; or pulmonary vascular resistance > 4 Wood units.  
The study protocol was approved by the institutional review board or ethics committee at 
each of the 22 enrolling sites, and all enrolled patients provided written informed consent. A data 
safety monitoring committee oversaw the program and reviewed trial data for patient safety at 
regular intervals. Because of the proprietary nature of the study data, it will not be made 
publically available at this time. All statistical analyses were performed independently by the 
Baim Clinical Research Institute. 
 
Randomization and blinding 
Eligible patients were randomized if they met all of the inclusion and exclusion criteria 
after undergoing the study-related qualification procedures (see online-only Data Supplement, 
Figure S1), including non-invasive screening with echocardiography and supine bicycle exercise 
right heart catheterization. Immediately following qualification, eligible patients were 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the treatment or control group. Patient randomization was performed 
via the Interactive Web Response System. Patient blinding included sedation, earphones with 
music to preclude the patient from hearing the procedural discussions, and blindfolding (or the 
use of opaque screens) to prevent the participant from viewing the imaging screens. Participants 
and non-procedural research staff were blinded to treatment assignment for 1 year following 
randomization. Each site was assigned blinded and unblinded staff to facilitate unbiased patient 
assessments through follow-up. The physicians managing the randomized patients clinically 
(including the treating cardiologist) and research staff involved in conducting selected post-
  
9 
randomization evaluations, including the hemodynamic core laboratory, were blinded to study 
arm. Treating physicians were also blinded to all right heart catheterization measurements. 
Research staff were given explicit instructions to maintain patient blinding throughout the trial 
(online-only Data Supplement).  
 
Study procedures 
Prior to enrolling patients into the study, all interventional cardiology investigators and 
associated investigative staff at each site underwent training to optimize and standardize invasive 
hemodynamic testing and recording of hemodynamic data, and to ensure proper deployment of 
the IASD System II device.  
Once enrolled into the study, all patients underwent non-invasive screening, including 
comprehensive echocardiography to ensure EF≥40%, diastolic dysfunction, and the absence of 
significant RV dysfunction or valvular disease. Participants meeting echocardiographic criteria 
underwent further screening with invasive hemodynamic testing. Right heart and pulmonary 
arterial catheterization was performed from the right internal jugular vein approach using the 
standard Seldinger technique under fluoroscopic guidance. Using a fluid-filled pulmonary artery 
catheter, all participants underwent recording of hemodynamics (RA pressure, pulmonary artery 
pressure, and PCWP) with a properly zeroed and calibrated pressure transducer. Hemodynamic 
measurements were recorded at rest, with legs up in the exercise bike pedals [equivalent to a 
passive leg raise procedure, a preload challenge], and during supine bike exercise. All pressures 
recordings were performed at a 50 mm/s paper speed with adjustment of pressure (mmHg) scale 
as needed, and the recordings were saved for blinded measurement by the hemodynamic core 
laboratory. Cardiac output was measured with the thermodilution method, and pulmonary 
  
10 
vascular resistance was calculated as the transpulmonary gradient (mean pulmonary artery 
pressure – PCWP) divided by cardiac output.  
After the baseline right heart catheterization and exercise protocol, all patients who 
remained eligible by invasive hemodynamic criteria were sedated, blinded using the methods 
described above, and randomized to IASD treatment or sham control. Both treatment and control 
arm patients underwent femoral venous access after randomization. Patients randomized to the 
control arm underwent intracardiac or transesophageal echocardiographic examination of the 
atrial septum and LA appendage (but no transseptal puncture). Patients randomized to the 
treatment arm underwent a transseptal puncture and IASD System II implantation guided by 
fluoroscopy and intracardiac or transesophageal echocardiography. The IASD System II consists 
of a 1-piece self-expanding metal cage that has a double-disc design with an opening (barrel) in 
the center (Figure 1A-C). The implant is radiopaque and echogenic to allow for imaging during 
the implantation procedure. The LA side of the implant is flat so the legs rest flush against the 
LA wall, thereby minimizing the LA profile of the deployed implant. The RA side is curved to 
accommodate variable interatrial septal wall thicknesses, with only the leg ends contacting the 
RA wall. The expanded external diameter of each disc is 19.4 mm. The inner diameter of the 
barrel in the center of the fully expanded implant is 8 mm, which corresponds to the optimal 
interatrial communication size (i.e., maximizing ability to reduce PCWP during exercise, while 
keeping the ratio of pulmonary to systemic blood flow at 1.2-1.3; Figure 1D).15 Details 
regarding medication administration related to the procedure and device are listed in the online-
only Data Supplement (Supplementary Table S1). Patients randomized to the IASD who were 
not previously on an anticoagulant (e.g., warfarin, direct oral anticoagulant) were treated with 
clopidogrel post-procedure. All patients who were on clopidogrel at baseline were kept on 
  
11 
clopidogrel post-procedure. All patients in both treatment arms received aspirin post-procedure. 
The baseline use of these medications (prior to randomization) is listed in Supplementary Table 
S2.   
At 1 month after randomization, all study patients underwent repeat right heart 
catheterization with hemodynamic measurements at rest, with legs up, and during exercise using 
the exact same protocol as the exercise study performed at baseline. The primary effectiveness 
endpoint was change in PCWP during exercise from baseline to 1 month. All hemodynamic 
pressure measurements for the trial were made at end-expiration using a standardized 
measurement protocol by the hemodynamic core laboratory, which was blinded to treatment 
allocation, baseline vs. follow-up procedure, and all other clinical data. After initial review, for 
patients with hemodynamic values that were outside the expected range (e.g., PCWP > mean 
pulmonary artery pressure) a systematic re-ascertainment of hemodynamic tracings for those 
patients was conducted by the hemodynamic core laboratory in a blinded fashion as part of their 
quality assurance process. Secondary effectiveness endpoints included change in peak exercise 
PCWP from baseline at 1 month, change in exercise duration at 1 month, and change in peak 
exercise workload at 1 month. Additional endpoints included change in NYHA class and change 
in diuretic use from baseline.  
The primary safety endpoint was peri-procedural events and major adverse cardiac, 
cerebrovascular, and renal events (MACCRE) at 1 month. MACCRE included cardiovascular 
death, embolic stroke, device and/or procedure-related adverse cardiac events, new-onset or 
worsening of kidney dysfunction (defined as a decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate > 
20 mL/min/1.73 m2) through 1-month post implant. Additional safety-related endpoints included 
  
12 
the need for implant removal or occlusion of the implant, and HF hospitalization. All endpoints 
were adjudicated centrally by a blinded, independent clinical events committee.  
 
Statistical analysis 
The statistical analyses for the primary efficacy and safety outcomes (including power 
calculations and the use of a mixed effects model repeated measures [MMRM, described below]) 
were pre-specified a priori and documented in the trial protocol and in our prior publication on 
the rationale and design of the REDUCE LAP-HF I trial.17 We assumed a mean change in 
exercise PCWP of -6.0 mmHg in the treatment group and 0.0 mmHg in the control group at each 
of 20W, 40W, 60W and 80W stages, and assumed a standard deviation in PCWP change of 7.2 
mmHg in each treatment group at each of the stages of exercise. Based on these assumptions, a 
sample size of 20 evaluable participants per treatment arm yielded 82% power at a 2-sided 0.05 
level of significance to detect a significant beneficial effect of IASD System II over control when 
comparing treatment means using a mixed effects model repeated measures (MMRM)21 analysis 
of covariance (ANCOVA) that included data from all available stages of exercise, assuming the 
compound symmetry correlation structure where the pairwise correlations between 20W, 40W, 
60W and 80W stages of exercise are 0.8 or less.  
The key safety outcome analysis on the endpoint of MACCRE at 1 month is descriptive 
(percentage of patients with MACCRE and two-sided exact confidence interval of the percentage 
based on the binomial distribution for each treatment group). It was anticipated that the true 
MACCRE rate in the population would be approximately 5%. Under this assumption, there was 
a 92% chance in a sample of size of 20 that the observed rate would be 10% or less. This 
analysis was carried out on the intention-to-treat population (ITT; all randomized participants 
  
13 
[n=44], which was identical to the safety population) with available data (follow-up through 1 
month, or a MACCRE event by 1 month. Sample size calculations were performed using PASS 
14 software (NCSS, LLC, Kaysville, Utah, USA). 
The primary analysis was based on an ITT analysis that included all randomized patients 
with available data (n=44; n=22 in each treatment arm). Femoral venous access was attempted 
on all ITT patients; thus, the safety population (n=44) was identical to the ITT population. The 
per-protocol population consisted of 42 patients (2 of the patient randomized to the treatment 
arm were excluded from the per-protocol population because they did not receive the IASD 
implant). All statistical tests were carried out at a 2-sided 0.05 level of significance, and all p-
values were presented as 2-sided p-values. There was no imputation for missing data. For the 
primary mechanistic endpoint (change in PCWP during exercise from baseline at 1 month), the 2 
treatment groups were compared using the aforementioned pre-specified MMRM ANCOVA, 
which included data from all available stages of exercise. For the primary safety endpoint (peri-
procedural and 1-month MACCRE), the 2 treatment groups were compared using a 2-sided exact 
confidence interval of the percentage of patients who experienced events in the 2 groups based 
on the binomial distribution for each treatment arm; given the sample size and low MACCRE 
rates that were expected, there was no anticipation of a treatment difference on 1-month 
MACCRE. Mean values of continuous secondary effectiveness outcomes were compared 
between treatment groups using ANCOVA with adjustment for the baseline value of the variable 
of interest. The rate of HF hospitalization was compared between treatments using the Fisher 
exact test. Mean differences between baseline and 1-month PCWP at rest (legs down), legs up, 
20W, and peak exercise were calculated using paired t-tests within each treatment group. 
Analyses were carried out using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina, USA).

Role of the funding source 
REDUCE LAP-HF I was designed jointly by the academic steering committee and the 
sponsor. The study was funded by Corvia Medical Inc. Data collection and analyses were done 
by the Baim Clinical Research Institute (Boston, Massachusetts, USA). Interpretation of the 
results and preparation of the report was the responsibility of the co-principal investigators (TF 
and SJS) and the chair of the steering committee (LM). Corvia had no role in the collection, 
analysis, interpretation of data, or the decision to submit for publication. All study authors 
contributed to data collection and analysis, reviewed the report, read and approved the final 
version, and endorsed its submission for publication.  
 
RESULTS 
A total of 94 patients with HF and EF≥40% underwent screening procedures. Of the 94 
enrolled patients, 44 met inclusion/exclusion criteria and were randomized 1:1 to the IASD and 
control (sham) groups (Figure 2). Baseline demographic, clinical, and invasive hemodynamic 
characteristics were similar between treatment groups except for more black patients in the 
control arm (Table 1). Echocardiographic indices of diastolic function were similar between the 
treatment groups (Supplementary Table S3).  
The study participants ranged in age from 48-84 years (mean age 70 years), were 50% 
women, and had multiple comorbidities (including a 50% prevalence of atrial fibrillation). At the 
time of screening, all but 1 participant were NYHA class III. The vast majority (42/44, 95%) 
were on a diuretic at baseline, and 28/44 (64%) of the participants had at least 1 hospitalization 
  
15 
or emergency department/acute care facility visit for heart failure HF within the 12 months prior 
to enrollment. All study participants had an EF ≥ 40% at baseline, and the majority (39/44, 89%) 
had a baseline EF ≥ 50%.  
Implantation of the IASD System II was attempted in 21 of 22 of the participants 
randomized to the treatment arm. In one participant, RA access could not be established for 
insertion of the procedure catheters (an occluded inferior vena cava filter was noted); therefore, 
the procedure was aborted. No subsequent MACCRE events were reported in this participant. Of 
the 21 remaining participants in whom implantation was attempted, there was one participant in 
whom the device was inadvertently fully deployed in the LA instead of at the interatrial septum. 
The device was percutaneously retrieved over the guidewire and the implantation of a second 
device was not attempted (see online-only Data Supplement for further details [Supplementary 
Table S4]). The 20 remaining participants randomized to the IASD treatment arm were 
successfully implanted; 19 participants had one implantation attempt and one participant had two 
implantation attempts. Table 2 lists the differences in procedure characteristics between study 
groups. Total procedure duration, total fluoroscopy duration, and total contrast administered 
were greater in the treatment group compared to the control group. See online-only Data 
Supplement (Supplementary Table S4) for further details about the procedural and device 
characteristics. Of the 20 participants who underwent successful device implantation, one 
refused repeat right heart catheterization at 1 month but remained in the trial and underwent all 
other follow-up assessments. All 22 control arm patients underwent repeat right heart 
catheterization with invasive hemodynamic testing at 1 month. 
The ITT analysis of the key effectiveness endpoint (PCWP during exercise) was 
performed on all participants who had PCWP results for at least one exercise level (at 20W, 
  
16 
40W, 60W or 80W) at both baseline and 1 month (all participants achieved an exercise level of 
at least 20W at 1 month). These results are shown in Table 3. Overall, the IASD treatment group 
had a greater reduction in PCWP during exercise after 1 month compared to the control group 
(p=0.028 by MMRM ANCOVA). Thus, the trial met its key effectiveness endpoint measure. On 
secondary outcome analysis, the change in peak PCWP at 1 month was -3.5±6.4 mmHg in the 
treatment group compared to -0.5±5.0 mmHg in the control group (P=0.14). As shown in Figure 
3, patients randomized to the IASD arm had a reduction in 1-month PCWP at legs up, 20W, and 
peak exercise (P<0.05 for all comparisons) while the control group did not. From baseline to 1 
month, the exercise time increased by a mean of 1.2±3.7 minutes in the treatment group 
compared to 0.4±3.5 minutes in the control group (P=0.60); and peak supine bike workload 
increased by a mean of 1.5±14.6 Watts in the treatment group compared to -1.9±10.8 Watts in 
the control group (P=0.35). On exploratory analyses, legs up PCWP and 20W PCWP decreased 
to a greater amount in the IASD treatment group compared to the control group (P<0.05 for both 
comparisons) (Table 3). Results of the per-protocol analyses were very similar to the results of 
the ITT analysis described above.  
Overall, there were very few peri-procedural, MACCRE, or other serious adverse events 
in either the treatment or control groups at 1 month of follow-up (Table 4). At 1 month, 0/21 
(0%) of the participants in the treatment group experienced a MACCRE event and 1/22 (4.5%) 
of the participants in the control group experienced a MACCRE event (new onset/worsening 
kidney function event), P=1.0. At 1 month of follow-up there were no deaths; myocardial 
infarctions; post-procedural IASD occlusions or removals; or strokes or transient ischemic 
attacks reported in either of the study arms. Furthermore, during the 1-month follow-up period, 
none of the study participants in normal sinus rhythm at baseline developed new-onset atrial 
  
17 
fibrillation or flutter, and there were no systemic embolic events or cardiac perforation, cardiac 
tamponade, or emergency cardiac surgery reported in either of the study arms.  
At 1 month of follow-up, the rate of HF-related hospitalizations or emergency 
department/acute care facility visits requiring intravenous treatment was 0/21 (0.0%) in the 
treatment arm compared to 2/22 (9.1%) in the control arm (P=0.49). There were no significant 
differences in loop diuretic dose (furosemide equivalents, in mg) at baseline or at 1 month of 
follow-up between the 2 treatment groups (mean change from baseline of -0.9±9.7 mg in the 
treatment group vs. 0.9±20.0 mg in the control group, P=0.70).  
 
DISCUSSION 
The REDUCE LAP-HF I randomized, blinded, sham-controlled trial was designed to test 
the hypothesis that the implantation of the IASD System II device in the interatrial septum in 
patients with symptomatic HF and mid-range or preserved EF (≥40%) results in lowering of 
PCWP during exercise. The trial met its primary effectiveness endpoint, with statistically 
significant lowering of PCWP during exercise at 1 month of follow-up (p=0.028). The 3-mmHg 
reduction in peak exercise PCWP in the IASD arm at 1 month is similar to the reduction seen in 
the prior observational study (n=64, all of whom received the IASD) at 6 months.18,19 Although 
the decrease in peak exercise PCWP is modest, it was associated with clinically important 
improvements in exercise duration and quality of life in the prior observational study, which 
were observed at both 6 and 12 months after IASD implantation.18,19  
The REDUCE LAP-HF I trial also showed that the IASD device was safe at 1 month. In 
1 patient the IASD was mal-deployed in the left atrium, but since the device remains on the 
guidewire after deployment and is fully retrievable, it was safely removed. The key safety 
outcome measure for the trial was MACCRE at 1 month, defined as the composite of 
  
18 
cardiovascular death, embolic stroke, device and/or procedure related adverse cardiac events, and 
new-onset or worsening kidney dysfunction. Implantation of the IASD appeared to be safe at 1 
month, with no MACCRE events reported in the IASD treatment arm compared to a 1-month 
MACCRE rate of 4.5% in the control arm. In addition, no patients in the treatment arm 
developed post-procedural persistent or permanent atrial fibrillation/flutter or complications such 
as cardiac perforation, cardiac tamponade, emergency cardiac surgery, systemic embolization, or 
major vascular complications. Finally, consistent with prior observational trials of the IASD, 
none of the treatment arm patients experienced device embolization, device occlusion, or device 
migration, and none of them required a repeat procedure for removal or occlusion of the device.  
As shown in Table 1, the patients enrolled in the trial were similar to those in prior 
studies of patients with HFpEF.22 Participants were elderly, 50% female, and were obese and had 
multiple comorbidities. Left ventricular EF was preserved (>50%) in the majority, and most of 
the participants were on a relatively high dose of diuretics and had a prior HF hospitalization or 
acute care visit within the last 12 months. On invasive hemodynamic testing, baseline resting 
PCWP was elevated (mean 20 mmHg) despite being on a mean dose of diuretics of 103 mg 
furosemide-equivalents per day. Thus, the patients were symptomatic and had significant HF. 
Patients enrolled in REDUCE LAP-HF I were generally similar to those enrolled in HFpEF 
epidemiologic studies23 and also contemporary HFpEF clinical trials.22 However, unlike these 
prior studies, patients enrolled in the present trial had objective evidence of elevated LV filling 
pressure (i.e., PCWP) at rest and during exercise at baseline, which confirmed the HF diagnosis. 
Together, these findings show that patients enrolled in REDUCE LAP-HF I represented 
contemporary HFpEF patients encountered in clinical practice.  
  
19 
The findings from REDUCE LAP-HF I trial are important because they are the first 
randomized data for this device. In the prior observational, open-label studies of the Corvia 
IASD in patients with HFpEF, including a total of 75 patients with the IASD implanted,18-20 the 
IASD was associated with lower PCWP during exercise, greater exercise capacity, and an 
excellent safety profile, but none of these prior studies were conclusive because they were non-
randomized and therefore subject to potential bias and confounding. In the present trial, 
randomized evaluation of the IASD confirmed the lowering of PCWP during exercise and 
demonstrated improvements in workload-corrected PCWP, exercise duration, and peak exercise 
workload compared to sham control. However, while these latter secondary outcomes were 
numerically better in the treatment group, the differences did not achieve statistical significance, 
as the trial was not powered to demonstrate effectiveness in these endpoints.  
Despite the fact that patients with HFpEF have evidence of pulmonary vascular 
stiffening, in open-label treated HFpEF patients enrolled in prior studies,19 left-to-right shunting 
through the IASD (which increases flow through the pulmonary vasculature) was not associated 
with increased pulmonary artery pressure or pulmonary vascular resistance, both of which could 
be deleterious in HFpEF due to increased RV load, with subsequent right-sided HF. The present 
randomized trial findings were similar to the prior open-label studies; there was a greater 
reduction in mean pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance in the IASD 
treatment arm compared to control arm, though these differences did not achieve statistical 
significance (Table 3). Possible explanations for the seemingly paradoxical trend towards lower 
PA pressures after IASD placement are two-fold. First, elevated PCWP can result in an 
augmentation of the reflected pressure wave in the pulmonary artery, which would raise 
pulmonary artery pressures and can lead to increased pulmonary vascular resistance.24 Lowering 
  
20 
of LA pressure and PCWP would therefore tend to reduce the reflected pressure wave, thereby 
lowering pulmonary artery pressure. Second, the LA blood that is shunted across the IASD is 
oxygenated and thus increases pulmonary artery saturation. The higher oxygen content in the 
pulmonary arterial vasculature, which was also seen in response to the IASD in prior non-
randomized studies, could have a vasodilatory effect that allows for the ability of the pulmonary 
vasculature to handle increased flow from the IASD-induced left-to-right shunting. This may be 
especially evident during exercise, as was seen in the present study (Table 3).  
Elevated LV filling pressure (i.e., increased PCWP) at rest or during exercise is an 
important determinant of both symptoms and outcomes in HF patients.25 Borlaug and colleagues 
showed that elevated PCWP during exercise can distinguish patients with HFpEF from those 
with non-cardiac dyspnea, and that the rise in PCWP during exercise is an important 
pathophysiologic determinant of HFpEF early in the course of the clinical syndrome.26 PCWP 
during exercise also correlates with 6-minute walk test distance and is an important determinant 
of mortality in patients with HFpEF.13,14 In addition, implantable hemodynamic sensor-guided 
lowering of pulmonary artery diastolic pressure (a surrogate for PCWP in left heart failure) has 
been shown to reduce HF hospitalizations in patients with HF and EF > 40%.27 On this 
background and in view of the hemodynamic effect of reduced exercise PCWP with the 
IASD,18,19 it is expected that treatment with the IASD will result in improved clinical outcomes 
in HFpEF patients. However, this hypothesis must be tested in a larger, adequately powered 
randomized controlled trial. 
The importance of testing cardiovascular device therapies against sham control 
procedures cannot be underestimated. The mere act of having an invasive control procedure 
alone may result in improved symptoms in HF patients. While studies of invasive treatments can 
  
21 
be difficult to study in a blinded fashion, lack of blinding may overestimate the effectiveness of 
treatments.28,29 Thus, the present trial—which evaluated a hemodynamic primary endpoint in a 
blinded fashion—is an important step in the development of the IASD as a potential treatment 
for HF patients. The finding that the IASD does indeed lower exercise PCWP provides a 
mechanistic rationale for further randomized evaluation of the device in a larger pivotal trial that 
has clinical endpoints.  
Certain limitations should be considered. Although an a priori power calculation was 
conducted showing adequate statistical power with a sample size of n=20 in each treatment 
group, the overall size of the trial is small. Thus, while the treatment groups were overall well-
balanced, there were some demographic and clinical differences between the groups, though only 
the difference in race/ethnicity was statistically significant. Furthermore, the primary 
effectiveness endpoint (PCWP during exercise) can be challenging to measure, even with 
training of sites and the use of a central hemodynamic core laboratory, as was done in the present 
study. However, the passive preload increase maneuver (which was done in this trial with legs up 
in the supine exercise bicycle pedals) does not suffer from the motion artifact of exercise but still 
provides information on how the LA handles an increased load. In the present trial, PCWP 
during the legs up maneuver decreased significantly at 1 month in the IASD treatment group but 
not in the control group (Table 3 and Figure 3), supporting the mechanistic effect of the IASD. 
An additional limitation relates to the use of anticoagulants (i.e., clopidogrel) in the IASD-treated 
patients not previously on a non-aspirin anticoagulant, but not in sham-control patients. Although 
we had specific instructions to maintain blinding throughout the trial (see the online-only Data 
Supplement), we did not administer a questionnaire to evaluate the success of blinding at 1 
month (we do have a questionnaire at the 1 year follow-up visit that will evaluate blinding). A 
  
22 
final limitation relates to the relatively short time frame of the study (1 month follow-up). 
However, the open-label studies show prolonged hemodynamic and symptomatic benefits of the 
IASD at 1 year.19  
 
In summary, we found that in patients with HF and EF ≥ 40%, implantation of an IASD 
reduced PCWP during exercise to a greater extent than a sham control procedure, demonstrating 
that in HF patients with elevated LA pressure during exercise, the creation of an 8-mm interatrial 
communication unloads the LA. We also found that the IASD is safe compared to sham control 
procedure at 1 month, and showed favorable but non-significant trends in several additional 
secondary hemodynamic and functional endpoints. These findings suggest that the IASD could 
have beneficial effects in patients with HFpEF and HF with mid-range EF, setting the stage for a 
larger-scale randomized clinical trial powered to examine the effects of the IASD on symptoms, 
quality of life, exercise capacity, and clinical outcomes.

Caption: (A) Corvia InterAtrial Shunt Device (IASD) System II; (B) En face view of the IASD 
System II (single size, internal diameter = 8 mm); (C) The IASD creates an interatrial shunt that 
unloads the left atrium by shunting blood from the higher pressure left atrium to the lower 
pressure right atrium; (D) Simulation studies have shown that an 8-mm internal diameter for the 
shunt device is optimal in maximally reducing left atrial pressure without overloading the right 
heart (i.e., keeping pulmonary-to-systemic flow relatively low at a 1.2-1.3 range). Figure 1D was 
reproduced with permission from Kaye D, et al. J Card Fail 2014. CVP = central venous

*In 1 patient in the control arm, femoral venous access was attempted but could not be established. Thus, the 
denominator is n=21 for the control arm for both femoral venous access and echocardiographic guidance tool.  
**The device did not deploy properly in 1 patient enrolled in the treatment arm (the left atrium legs of the device did 
not deploy so the device was removed without incident and another device was successfully deployed). 
***In 1 patient enrolled in the treatment arm, a small thrombus was observed on the tip of the device delivery system 
in the right atrium. The delivery system was removed and exchanged. A new system was then re-inserted and the 
IASD device was successfully implanted.  
****In 1 patient enrolled in the treatment arm, the device was inadvertently mal-deployed in the left atrium. The device 
remained on the guidewire and was percutaneously removed, and the procedure was subsequently aborted.

artery disease (n=11), history of stroke, transient ischemic attack, deep vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism 
within the last 6 months (n=5), resting right atrial pressure > 14 mmHg on invasive hemodynamic testing (n=5), not an 
appropriate participant in the opinion of the investigator (n=5), significant valvular disease (n=4), severe chronic 
kidney disease (n=2), severe heart failure (n=1), baseline 6-minute walk test outside of acceptable range of 60-500 
m, untreated clinically significant carotid stenosis (n=1), right ventricular dysfunction (n=1), significant lung disease 
(n=1), severe untreated obstructive sleep apnea (n=1), and current immunosuppressive therapy (n=1). In addition, 2 
participants could not be enrolled because the study was closed to enrollment during the screening period, and 1 
patient was diagnosed with breast cancer and wanted to defer the study while she underwent chemotherapy. Note: 
some participants had more than 1 reason for being excluded from the trial.  
** One participant withdrew consent to participate in the study during the index procedure. Right atrial access could 
not be obtained for insertion of the intracardiac echocardiography probe and the participant was unblinded 
immediately after the attempt.  The participant withdrew consent at that point upon learning that device placement 
was not feasible. 
*** One participant refused repeat invasive hemodynamic testing but completed all other study procedures.
