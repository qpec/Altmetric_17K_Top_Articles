Echocardiography in shock management
Anthony S. McLean
Abstract
Echocardiography is pivotal in the diagnosis and management of the shocked patient. Important characteristics in
the setting of shock are that it is non-invasive and can be rapidly applied.
In the acute situation a basic study often yields immediate results allowing for the initiation of therapy, while a
follow-up advanced study brings the advantage of further refining the diagnosis and providing an in-depth
hemodynamic assessment. Competency in basic critical care echocardiography is now regarded as a mandatory
part of critical care training with clear guidelines available. The majority of pathologies found in shocked patients
are readily identified using basic level 2D and M-mode echocardiography. A more comprehensive diagnosis can be
achieved with advanced levels of competency, for which practice guidelines are also now available. Hemodynamic
evaluation and ongoing monitoring are possible with advanced levels of competency, which includes the use of
colour Doppler, spectral Doppler, and tissue Doppler imaging and occasionally the use of more recent technological
advances such as 3D or speckled tracking.
The four core types of shock—cardiogenic, hypovolemic, obstructive, and vasoplegic—can readily be identified by
echocardiography. Even within each of the main headings contained in the shock classification, a variety of pathologies
may be the cause and echocardiography will differentiate which of these is responsible. Increasingly, as a result of
more complex and elderly patients, the shock may be multifactorial, such as a combination of cardiogenic and septic
shock or hypovolemia and ventricular outflow obstruction.
The diagnostic benefit of echocardiography in the shocked patient is obvious. The increasing prevalence of critical care
physicians experienced in advanced techniques means echocardiography often supplants the need for more invasive
hemodynamic assessment and monitoring in shock.

Background
Whether the cause of shock is unknown, suspected, or
established, echocardiography is utilized in its diagnosis
and management and to monitor progress. It is recom-
mended as the modality of first choice in consensus guide-
lines [1]. No other investigative bedside tool can offer a
similar diagnostic capability, allowing for exact targeting
of the underlying cardiac and hemodynamic problems
whether it be the right heart, left heart, fluid perturba-
tions, pericardial, or a cardiac response to vasoplegia as
found in septic shock. The clinician needs to undertake a
careful, structured echocardiographic examination, even
in an emergency situation where urgency demands a rapid
assessment.
Competency standards are well established for both
basic and advanced critical care echocardiography and
the scope of this review will cover both [2, 3] (Table 1).
Both transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and trans-
esophageal echocardiography (TEE) expertise should be
available, the latter being seen as part of the armament-
aria of the advanced practitioner. It may be an iterative
process whereby a basic assessment or rapid cardiac as-
sessment by echo (RACE) is performed immediately in

 the deteriorating patient, with subsequent initiation of
treatment, followed at a later time by a more detailed
advanced echocardiographic assessment.
Shock: definition and classification
Shock can be defined as a life‐threatening, generalized
form of circulatory failure associated with inadequate
oxygen delivery to the cells [1]. The four major under-
lying mechanisms, either alone or in combination, in-
clude inadequate circulating volume (cardiogenic shock),
failure of pump function (hypovolemic shock), obstruction
to blood flow (obstructive shock), and loss of vascular
tone (vasoplegic shock). The diagnosis of acute circulatory
failure includes the clinical signs of hypotension (not al-
ways present), poor peripheral perfusion determined by
skin changes, especially cold, clammy, discolored skin, de-
creased urine output (<0.5 ml/kg/min), and altered mental
function, including obtundation and confusion. It should
be noted that a defined level of blood pressure to denote
the presence of shock is not recommended [1, 4].
Cardiogenic shock
Cardiogenic shock is the extreme end of the acute deteri-
orating heart failure spectrum. A global study involving
666 hospitals involving nearly 5000 patients admitted to
hospital with acute heart failure found 36 % were first time
episodes, 37 % were in pulmonary edema, and 12 % were
in cardiogenic shock [5]. Overall hospital mortality was
12 %, rising to 18 % in those patients admitted to ICU.
Cardiogenic shock carries the worst prognosis with im-
provements in mortality, from 70 to 50 %, resulting mainly
from early revascularization. Consensus documents from
major societies are available [6].
Although most of the literature pertaining to cardiogenic
shock relates to underlying coronary artery pathology, the
critical care physician encounters a broader range of path-
ologies, including sepsis, resulting in severe cardiac failure
and echocardiography is the only bedside tool that can ac-
curately elucidate the underlying pathology.
A RACE assessment, using only two-dimensional (2D)
and

major
underlying abnormalities rapidly in the acute scenario
[7]. Overall left ventricular contraction, including ejec-
tion fraction, segmental wall motion abnormalities, right
heart failure, clues to intravascular volume status, and
pericardial tamponade, can be identified. However, ad-
vanced techniques involving the use of spectral Doppler
and tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) yield much more in-
formation, providing both diagnostic and hemodynamic
evaluation.
Overall cardiac performance
The estimation of cardiac output by echocardiography
(echo) is well validated. Although it can be measured
using the 2D Simpson’s multidisc method, the use of
pulsed-wave Doppler across the left ventricular output
tract (LVOT) is more accurate [8]. This often supplants
invasively acquired CO measurements unless continuous
monitoring is considered important. Other parameters of
overall cardiac function, such as myocardial performance
index (MPI) and mitral annulus plane systolic excursion
(MAPSE) are not well validated in critically ill subjects.
The LVOT velocity time integral (VTI) as a single meas-
ure that can be used as a surrogate for the stroke volume
with a normal value >20 cm [9]. A value above 18 cm im-
plies an adequate stroke volume.
Left ventricular systolic function
Contractility is the ability of the myocardium to contract
against a specific load for any given preload. Echo is
used to measure contraction, which is measured as the
degree of myocardial fiber shortening that occurs during
systole. The most common cause of cardiogenic shock
results from marked reduction in left ventricular con-
traction. The size of both the left atrium and ventricle
may provide clues to the duration of the contractile im-
pairment, with dilatation indicating a degree of chron-
icity (Fig. 1). Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is
a traditional parameter which, though far from ideal, can
be a helpful guide. The Simpson’s multidisc method can
be applied in RACE. Subjective evaluation or “eyebal-
ling” the LVEF is reasonably accurate with experience
but objective measurement should always be considered
in the advanced study. It is sufficiently robust to be used
regularly in large studies in the chronic heart failure

 setting where it serves as a prognostic marker [10].
When the endocardial border is difficult to visualize,
contrast echo may enhance accuracy [11].
Interpretation needs to take into account the effects of
arterial blood pressure (afterload), inotropes, and vaso-
pressors. For example, a struggling left ventricle may ap-
pear normal in the presence of inotropes. Other cardiac
pathologies need to be taken into account as a normal
or high LVEF may misled the clinician into believing
there is good cardiac function although marked diastolic
or valvular dysfunction is present.
Fractional area change (FAC) has been used to assess
the left ventricle with reasonable accuracy in surgical pa-
tients undergoing TEE during cardiac surgery [12]. It
can be measured from either the parasternal short axis
view (PSAX) using TTE or the transgastric view with
TEE short axis views, using the difference between the
end diastolic and end systolic areas divided by the end
diastolic area, with a normal range being 38–60 %. The
reliability is less certain in hemodynamically unstable pa-
tients, in the presence of segmental wall motion defects
or left bundle-branch block, or where right ventricular
dysfunction exists, and as a result is used less commonly
in the ICU setting compared with the operating theatre.
The advanced practitioner can use a number of
Doppler and TDI parameters to more accurately quan-
tify left ventricular dysfunction. When mitral regurgita-
tion is present, dP/dt can be calculated, a normal value
being >1200 mmHg/s and markedly abnormal values be-
ing <800 mmHg/s [13]. Using TDI, the myocardial sys-
tolic velocity S’
, measured from an average of readings
from multiple segments, correlates with LVEF. In a study
involving four basal segments, a S’ >7.5 correlated with an
LVEF >50 % with a sensitivity of 79 % and specificity of
88 % [14]. Using an average of six basal segments, Gulati
and colleagues found an S’ >5.4 indicated an LVEF >50 %
with sensitivity 88 % and specificity 97 % [15]. It should be
noted that S’ decreases with age and does not differentiate
active contraction from tethering effects.
Other techniques currently under investigation, al-
though contributing to left ventricular contraction as-
sessment in the stable outpatient population, have yet to
prove beneficial in the critically ill. Strain rate imaging
and speckle tracking using global longitudinal strain
have been demonstrated to identify systolic dysfunction
in patients with normal LVEF in oncology and heart fail-
ure patients [16, 17]. The value in critically ill patients is
still uncertain [18].
Any assessment of left ventricular contractility needs
to take the presence or absence of identifiable segmental
wall motion abnormalities into account; if present, ur-
gent revascularization should be considered to enhance
prognosis.
Valvular pathology
Echocardiographic investigation extends to possible valvu-
lar lesions, both acute and preexisting, like degenerative
aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation, frequently found
in the older population. Acute lesions such as peri‐infarc-
tion rupture of a papillary muscle resulting in severe mi-
tral regurgitation may necessitate urgent surgical repair of
the valve. Initial examination of the valves in the acute
setting, allowing for initiation of treatment, requires rea-
sonable but not necessarily expert skills. A more compre-
hensive valve examination can be performed later by
clinicians highly skilled in valve evaluation (Fig. 2).

 Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction
Approximately half the patients presenting with acute
heart failure have preserved ejection fraction via a
number of mechanisms, including diastolic dysfunction-
reduced coronary flow reserve [19, 20]. High metabolic
states frequently found in critically ill patients can ex-
acerbate cardiac failure by worsening diastolic function.
Although there is a comprehensive background to asses-
sing left ventricular diastolic function, it was the advent
of TDI that simplified the situation and brought analysis
to the bedside. In particular, TDI analysis of the mitral
annulus allows for rapid estimation of left atrial pressure
(LAP), an important parameter in evaluating left ven-
tricular function and preload.
The use of spectral Doppler of mitral inflow still re-
mains paramount. Both an E/A ratio >2 and an E wave
deceleration time <120 ms predict a LAP >20 mmHg
[21]. With TDI, the mitral annulus e′ offers a quick
guide to the presence of left ventricular diastolic dys-
function with a lateral e′ <10 and medial <7 cm/s highly
suggestive of diastolic dysfunction and elevated left atrial
pressures [22].
The E/e′ ratio, although still affected by loading condi-
tions, is of considerable value by giving a guide to ele-
vated left atrial pressures. The original description using
patients with coronary disease or heart failure used an
E/e′ <8 to indicate normal LAP and a value >15 gave an
LAP >13 mmHg [23]. The average of the lateral and sep-
tal e′ measurements is recommended. Interestingly, re-
cent international guidelines on assessing left ventricular
diastolic dysfunction choose a discriminating average
E/e′ value of 14 to identify elevated left atrial pres-
sure [24].
The E/e′ value used to identify elevated left atrial pres-
sures in patients on positive ventilation is less than that
used in non-ventilated patients, around 12 using the
average septal/lateral e′ rather than the classic 14–15
[25]. However, a precise and accurate value is unclear.
Positive pressure ventilation affects left ventricular dia-
stolic filling in a number of often opposing ways and the
overall effects are difficult to predict. Increased intratho-
racic pressure, by reducing systemic venous return,
results in decreased left ventricular preload and, by de-
creasing the atrial–ventricular pressure gradient, reduces
E and e′. Lung hyperinflation can decrease pulmonary
vascular resistance when the volume increase is less than
the functional reserve capacity but beyond this will in-
crease the resistance with subsequent effects on right
ventricular afterload and left ventricular preload. A low-
ering of the transmural pressure decreases afterload of
the left-sided chambers, resulting in an increase in left
atrial contractility and subsequent augmentation of ven-
tricular filling, theoretically increasing A and a’
, and even
E and e′ [26]. In critically ill patients an E/e′ >13 is
indicative of elevated left atrial pressure and, although
very useful, is not without controversy [27, 28].
Other considered pathologies in cardiogenic shock
The contribution of right heart function to shock will
be covered in the “Hypovolemic shock” section. Post-
infarction ventricular septal defects, although uncommon,
often occur some days after the actual infarction and are
usually catastrophic. The presence of new onset aortic re-
gurgitation, particularly when it is associated with a peri-
cardial effusion, should lead to investigation of dissection
of the thoracic aorta. This requires a TEE.
Hypovolemic shock
Although particularly pertinent in suspected hypovol-
emic shock, assessment of intravascular volume is the
starting point in all types of circulatory failure. Often
clinically insufficient volume is readily evident but can
be difficult to determine by physical examination alone.
At the basic level of competency the clinician relies on
2D and M‐mode echocardiography only. When hypovol-
emia is severe, 2D views can be impelling when they
show collapse of the left ventricular walls at end‐systole,
the so‐called “kissing walls”. Conversely, fixed bowing of
the atrial septum into the right atrium throughout the
cardiac cycle implies elevated left atrial pressures and
further fluid is not necessary (Fig. 3). It should be noted
that neither of these signs are specific for intravascular
fluid status. Left ventricular end diastolic area (LVEDA)
appears to be helpful in assessing response to a volume
load in anaesthetized patients undergoing surgery but
unfortunately not in the critically ill patients [29].
Inferior vena cava (IVC) variation has been recognized
as a useful parameter for some decades now and, while
far from ideal, is a good place to start. Numerous studies
have explored refining the technique using vessel diam-
eter variation in response to the respiratory cycle, max-
imum diameter, and percentage of diameter alteration to
assess right atrial pressure (RAP) [30].
Guidelines recommend that in the spontaneously
breathing patient an IVC diameter (D) <21 mm that col-
lapses with a sniff (i.e., the caval or collapsibility index
[CI = (Dmax − Dmin)/Dmax × 100 %]) indicates a normal
RAP of 3 mmHg, whereas an IVC diameter >21 mm
that collapses <50 % with a sniff indicates a RAP of
>15 mmHg [31]. In a study of 73 emergency patients
over 50 years of age, Nagdev and colleagues demon-
strated, without taking IVC diameter into account, that
an IVC collapse of >50 % had a positive predictive value
of 87 % and a negative predictive value of 96 % of a cen-
tral venous pressure <8 mmHg with a receiver operating
curve (ROC) of 0.93 [32]. In a study on IVC diameter
variation following fluid administration to hypovolemic
trauma patients, inadequate dilatation indicated insufficient

 circulating blood volume despite normalization of blood
pressure [33].
The transition from the cardiology setting to critical
care practice resulted in a conceptual change, with
changes in IVC diameter being used to assess fluid re-
sponsiveness rather than pressure equivalents.
For practical purposes, in the acute setting for the spon-
taneously breathing patient in shock, the IVC diameter is
measured within 0.5–3 cm from the caval–right atrial
junction in the subcostal view and when the diameter is
less than 10 mm the patient is likely to respond to fluid,
but when greater than 20 mm that is unlikely. Collapse of
>50 % between the diameters of 10–20 mm should result
in a trial of fluid. In the patient on fully supported positive
pressure ventilation, the distensibility index (dIVC) is a
good guide to fluid responsiveness. The dIVC is calculated
as the ratio of (Dmax − Dmin)/Dmin, with a threshold of 18 %
discriminating between responders and non-responders
with 90 % sensitivity and 90 % specificity [34].
There are pitfalls when performing IVC measurements
and the operator should take care to obtain a good lon-
gitudinal view with the scan plane parallel to the IVC
and the probe tilted in both directions to obtain the lar-
gest diameter. As the IVC can move inferiorly during in-
spiration, two different segments of the vessel can be
inadvertently measured using M‐mode, so 2D measure-
ments, with the highest possible frame rate, are recom-
mended. Neither collapse nor distension of the IVC
during respiratory ventilation should be used on patients
receiving partial ventilatory support and, even in both
groups described above, the clinician can only occasion-
ally confidently predict fluid responsiveness on the IVC
alone. Furthermore, the presence of right heart failure,
increased intra‐abdominal pressure, or pericardial fluid
makes the use of IVC even less reliable.
When TEE is being applied, the superior vena cava in
the fully supported ventilated patient can be used and a
collapse of >36 % during inspiration discriminates fluid
responders from non‐responders with a sensitivity of
90 % and specificity of 100 % [35].
The use of static measurements to assess fluid status is
recognized to be inadequate in the majority of situations
and dynamic techniques need to be applied. Administra-
tion of a bolus of intravenous fluid, passive leg raising,
and positive pressure ventilation-induced variation in
stroke volume (SV) and CO are commonly employed.
As a guide, fluid responsiveness is determined if there is,
on average, a >15 % increase in SV or CO. The under-
lying physiology is well covered elsewhere and the focus
of this review is on the practical application of echocar-
diography in shocked patients. [36]. Essentially, large SV
variations occur on the steep part of the Starling curve
and small variations on the flat part of the curve and ei-
ther the SV or a surrogate measure, such as the velocity
time integral (VTI), can be measured echocardiographi-
cally in response to the maneuver chosen. Doppler appli-
cation uses the relationship between the velocities of
blood flowing across the LVOT at the level of the aortic
valve annulus or, alternatively, flow across the right ven-
tricular outflow tract (RVOT) at the level of the pulmon-
ary valve annulus, combined with the cross-sectional
area (CSA = π(LVOT diameter/2)2) of the chosen loca-
tion. CO and SV are measured using pulsed‐wave
Doppler with the sample volume placed at the level of
the aortic annulus for left ventricular outflow (where
SV = VTI × CSA and CO = SV × Heart rate). Care must

 be taken to properly align the Doppler beam to the flow
and VTI is measured by tracing the modal velocity.
Selected maneuvers
Intravenous fluid administration
Application of a bolus of intravenous fluid has long been
used to assess fluid responsiveness with clinical parame-
ters, especially systemic blood pressure, used as an end-
point. Pulse pressure variation is used as blood pressure
does not always reflect fluid responsiveness, particularly
when other factors, such as impaired left ventricular
contraction or marked vasoplegia, exist. With increasing
awareness of the perils of excessive fluid administration,
the practice of mini‐boluses of fluid is attractive. This is
particularly the case in patients with impaired left ven-
tricular function who are at greater risk of acute pulmon-
ary edema. In a study on 39 low volume-ventilated
critically ill patients, sub-aortic VTI was measured follow-
ing an initial 100 ml of starch administered over 1 minute
followed by another 400 ml over 14 minutes. A change in
VTI of >10 % after the first 100 ml predicted fluid respon-
siveness with a sensitivity and specificity of 95 % and
78 %, respectively (area under curve (AUC) = 0.92) [37].
Respiratory variation
During the inspiratory phase of positive pressure ventila-
tion, right ventricular output is reduced because of a de-
crease in venous return (increased intrathoracic pressure)
causing a subsequent decrease in left ventricular output
after two to three beats if both ventricles are volume re-
sponsive. These approaches are limited to fully ventilated
patients and studies were performed using tidal volumes
of 8–10 ml/kg. As smaller tidal volumes are not proven to
be diagnostically helpful, it may be necessary to temporar-
ily increase these to 8 ml/kg. A SV variation >10 % is
highly predictive of volume responsiveness [38]. An in-
crease in a respiratory rate from 14-16 to 30-40 breaths
per minute in hypovolaemic patients resulted in a de-
crease in pulse pressure variation from 21 % to 4 % and in
respiratory variation in aortic flow from 23 % to 6 %, with
no accompanying change in cardiac index [39].
One factor to consider when using positive pressure
ventilation to predict fluid responsiveness in mechanic-
ally ventilated patients is right ventricular function.
Using TDI of the tricuspid annulus, Mahjoub and col-
leagues [40] found that an S’ <15 cm/s yields a false
positive positive pressure ventilation result.
Passive leg raising
Passive leg raising (PLR) has been demonstrated to be
applicable in both spontaneously breathing and venti-
lated patients. Correct positioning of the patient is es-
sential. CO is measured using pulsed‐wave Doppler. An
increase in CO or SV of >12 % during PLR was highly
predictive of fluid responsiveness with an AUC of 0.89
for the cardiac index and 0.9 for the SV. Sensitivity and
specificity values were 63 and 89 % for CO, and 69 and
89 % for SV, respectively [41]. Using esophageal Doppler,
Monnet and colleagues [42] demonstrated in 37 venti-
lated patients that a PLR increase of >10 % aortic blood
flow predicted fluid responsiveness with a sensitivity of
97 % and specificity of 94 %. A false positive response to
PLR may occur in the presence of increased intra-
abdominal pressure.
Assessing intravascular volume should be the first step
in managing all types of shock. A basic approach using
RACE generally identifies gross hypovolemia. Where un-
certainty exists about intravascular fluid status, more
advanced techniques utilizing Doppler and dynamic ma-
neuvers should be employed.
Obstructive shock
The common mechanism in patients with obstructive
shock is resistance to blood flow through the cardiopul-
monary circulation. Specific pathological diagnoses are
acute pulmonary embolus, cardiac tamponade, and dy-
namic outflow obstruction; on occasion, it also occurs as
a result of a type A dissection of the thoracic aorta or a
tension pneumothorax. Constrictive pericarditis is a rare
cause of obstructive shock.
Acute pulmonary embolus
Classic right heart changes identified by echo are diag-
nostically and prognostically very helpful, indeed essen-
tial, in the shocked patient [43]. Diagnostic criteria
include dilated right heart chambers, changes in right
ventricular contraction, elevated pulmonary artery pres-
sures, decreased cardiac output, and intra‐cavity emboli.
Dilatation of the right ventricle is readily assessed in the
apical four-chamber view with a right ventricle/left ven-
tricle area ratio >0.6; gross dilatation is seen with a ratio
>1.0. [44]. Right atrial area/volume is best measured by
the Simpson’s method in the apical four-chamber view.
Right ventricular contraction can be normal, hyperdy-
namic soon after the insult of the pulmonary embolus,
or hypodynamic in the later stages. Tricuspid annulus
plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) is a reasonably reliable
and easily obtainable parameter for overall right ven-
tricular contraction with a normal value being >16 mm.
TDI, using the lateral tricuspid annulus S’ velocity, is a
useful tool to identify early right ventricular dysfunction.
A right ventricular S’ velocity <11.5 cm/s predicts right
ventricular dysfunction (right ventricular ejection frac-
tion <45 %) with a sensitivity of 90 % and specificity of
85 % [45]. In regular daily practice an S’ of 10 cm/s is a
useful and easily remembered number to differentiate
between normal and abnormal right ventricular systolic
function.

 The McConnell sign, where good apical but poor free
wall contraction is seen, is considered an important sign
by some [46]. However, it is also found in right ventricu-
lar infarction and its specificity for pulmonary embolism
has been called into question [47, 48]. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is most commonly obtained by
converting the peak velocity of the tricuspid regurgita-
tion to pressure using the modified Bernoulli equation
and adding to the right atrial pressure. Care needs to
be taken to obtain accurate Doppler signals. In the
absence of a reliable tricuspid regurgitant signal, the
acceleration time of the pulmonary ejection signal (PAcT)
is used [49].
As a guide, a PAcT of 70–90 ms indicates a pulmonary
artery systolic pressure of >70 mmHg. The presence of
mid‐systolic notch also indicates severe pulmonary hyper-
tension (Fig. 4).
The classic 2D sign of pulmonary hypertension result-
ing in a marked increase in right ventricular pressures is
paradoxical septal motion, whereby a D‐shaped left
ventricle is seen on the parasternal short axis view.
The presence of mobile thrombo‐emboli in the right
heart chambers, inferior vena cava, or pulmonary ar-
tery are occasionally seen and may push the clinician
to early administration of thrombolytic therapy. Exam-
ination of the left ventricle is also informative in severe
acute pulmonary embolus, with small chamber size
and reduced cardiac output reflecting reduced left
heart filling.
Cardiac tamponade
When the intrapericardial pressure exceeds right heart fill-
ing pressure (diastole), impaired filling of the chambers
results in tamponade. A pericardial effusion is usually
readily identified by echo, although size is no guide to the
presence of tamponade. Fluid in the pericardial space is
generally easy to differentiate from a pericardial fat pad or
a pleural effusion. The crucial echo findings in RACE es-
tablishing the presence of tamponade and the need for
rapid drainage are either right atrial wall systolic collapse
for longer than one-third of the cardiac cycle, right ven-
tricular wall diastolic collapse, and a dilated IVC [50].
Doppler interrogation across the valves by the ad-
vanced user can be used for added diagnostic support.
Normal respiratory variation results in an increase of tri-
cuspid flow during inspiration and decrease during ex-
piration with reciprocal changes occurring with mitral
valve flow. Increases in peak tricuspid velocity are usu-
ally <25 % and peak mitral velocity <15 %, whereas with
tamponade the variation is much greater.
Echo is the investigation of choice in suspected cardiac
tamponade, with the diagnosis generally easy to make
when aligned with clinical findings. It also assists with
urgent pericardiocentesis.

 Dynamic LVOT obstruction
The true incidence of dynamic left ventricular outflow
obstruction in critically ill patients is unknown. It re-
quires advanced echo Doppler expertise and in the past
has usually gone unrecognized. Left ventricular wall
hypertrophy classically has alerted the clinician to the
possibility of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy
and searching for LVOT obstruction would be seen as
standard practice.
Dynamic LVOT obstruction can be present in the
aged ambulatory population in the absence of wall
hypertrophy [51]. Factors that make the critically ill
population more susceptible, apart from age, include
tachycardia, hypovolemia, and inotropes [52, 53]. 2D
echo examination reveals close approximation of lateral
wall and septum, plus systolic anterior motion of the an-
terior mitral leaflet. TEE examination often supplements
the TTE approach. Color Doppler will reveal turbulent
flow through the LVOT with continuous wave Doppler
picking up high velocities indicating obstructive and sub-
sequent pulsed-wave Doppler identifying exactly where
that obstruction occurs. A classic spectral Doppler pattern
is the so‐called “dagger” shape LVOT flow. Treatment in-
cludes re‐establishing an adequate intravascular volume,
reducing heart rate to enhance diastolic filling time, and
ceasing inotropes (Fig. 4).
Septic shock
A variety of cardiac changes can be associated with septic
shock, although a normal study also is not unusual
(Table 2). Abnormalities in left ventricular systolic func-
tion, left ventricular diastolic function, and right ventricu-
lar function have all been described [54]. Contractile
impairment may be exhibited as specific patterns such as
seen in Takutsubo syndrome with apical akinesis and
ballooning accompanied by good basal left ventricular
contraction. Occasionally, LVOT obstruction is also de-
scribed [55].
A variety of patterns can occur in septic cardio-
myopathy, including global left and/or right ventricular
hypokinesis, left ventricular segmental wall motion de-
fect patterns, and subtle changes only identified on sen-
sitive examination, such as with speckle tracking using
global longitudinal strain [56]. Importantly, the contract-
ile dysfunction is almost always reversible over days,
unless concomitant underlying coronary artery disease
or myocarditis are present. Measurement of ventricular
preload using echo to optimize a fluid management
strategy is recommended. A major pathological contri-
bution to shock in sepsis is peripheral vasoplegia and al-
though this is not measurable with echo, the cardiac
findings can be taken into account when estimating it.
For example, in shock a hyperdynamic, well filled left
ventricle is usually a clue to the presence of marked per-
ipheral vasodilatation. Echo has a pertinent role in evalu-
ating the valves in septic shock, both structurally and
functionally. Endocarditis or peri‐valvular abscesses may
be the cause of shock. TEE is the preferred technique,
although TTE can still be valuable in the acute setting.
The severity of any valve functional abnormality needs
to be assessed and more expert examination sought
where necessary, especially where prosthetic valves or
congenital heart disease exist.
Other causes of shock
Anaphylactic, neurogenic, hypo‐adrenalism, and other
less common causes of shock will be assisted by the ap-
plication of urgent echocardiography, sometimes in
directing the clinician away from the heart as a cause of
shock in the presence of a normal study.
Conclusions
Echocardiography is perhaps the most single useful tool
in the diagnosis and management of shock, particularly
where the etiology is undifferentiated or multifactorial.
Non‐invasive and rapid to initiate, it can be applied at
the bedside anytime during the day or night. An initial
basic or RACE study can lead to commencement of
treatment, with a more advanced study subsequently
providing incremental and vital additional information.
