Abstract
The adverse effects of mechanical ventilation in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) arise from two main
causes: unphysiological increases of transpulmonary pressure and unphysiological increases/decreases of pleural
pressure during positive or negative pressure ventilation. The transpulmonary pressure-related side effects primarily
account for ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) while the pleural pressure-related side effects primarily account for
hemodynamic alterations. The changes of transpulmonary pressure and pleural pressure resulting from a given
applied driving pressure depend on the relative elastances of the lung and chest wall. The term ‘volutrauma’ should
refer to excessive strain, while ‘barotrauma’ should refer to excessive stress. Strains exceeding 1.5, corresponding to
a stress above ~20 cmH2O in humans, are severely damaging in experimental animals. Apart from high tidal
volumes and high transpulmonary pressures, the respiratory rate and inspiratory flow may also play roles in the
genesis of VILI. We do not know which fraction of mortality is attributable to VILI with ventilation comparable to
that reported in recent clinical practice surveys (tidal volume ~7.5 ml/kg, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) ~8
cmH2O, rate ~20 bpm, associated mortality ~35%). Therefore, a more complete and individually personalized
understanding of ARDS lung mechanics and its interaction with the ventilator is needed to improve future care.
Knowledge of functional lung size would allow the quantitative estimation of strain. The determination of lung
inhomogeneity/stress raisers would help assess local stresses; the measurement of lung recruitability would guide
PEEP selection to optimize lung size and homogeneity. Finding a safety threshold for mechanical power,
normalized to functional lung volume and tissue heterogeneity, may help precisely define the safety limits of
ventilating the individual in question. When a mechanical ventilation set cannot be found to avoid an excessive risk
of VILI, alternative methods (such as the artificial lung) should be considered.

Background
For a reasonable number of years to come, mechan-
ical ventilation will likely still be needed. We acknow-
ledge the importance of stabilizing hemodynamics [1],
achieving synchrony [2], preserving muscle strength
[3, 4], avoiding the consequences of intubation [5],
minimizing dynamic hyperinflation [6], and monitor-
ing the biological reactions—all important goals of
ventilatory support. In this brief review, however, we
focus primarily on limiting tissue damage, thereby
improving the safety of artificial ventilation. Further
we will limit our analysis to ARDS patients, who are
among the most problematic to manage among the
mechanically ventilated patients. However, the princi-
ples of a safe treatment are equally applicable to all
mechanically ventilated patients. To artificially inflate
the lung (i.e., to increase the transpulmonary pressure
(PL), airway pressure – pleural pressure (Paw – Ppl)),
two diametrically opposed options can be applied: ei-
ther totally positive airway pressure ventilation associ-
ated with an increase of pleural pressure or totally
negative pressure ventilation, in which the chest cage
is expanded by external negative pressure. Between
these two extremes, mixed forms of ventilation may

 be applied, primarily by providing positive pressure to
the airways while allowing spontaneous contraction of
the respiratory muscles, which decrease pleural pres-
sure during inspiration (Table 1). To discuss the fu-
ture we must first understand the current problems
associated with mechanical ventilation.
Adverse effects of mechanical ventilation
The adverse effects of mechanical ventilation may be
grouped into two main categories. One category relates
to excessive/unphysiological transpulmonary pressure
(always positive), and the other relates to excessive/un-
physiological variation of pleural pressure, either positive
or negative (Fig. 1).
Side effects associated with pleural pressure
The magnitude and direction of change in pleural pres-
sure, negative or positive, depends on the ratio of chest
wall elastance (EW) relative to the elastance of the re-
spiratory system (Etot). The latter equals the sum of the
chest wall elastance and the lung elastance (EL). Accord-
ingly, during positive pressure ventilation the following
relationship applies under static conditions [7]:
ΔPpl ¼ ΔPaw⋅ Ew
Etot
ð1Þ
During negative pressure ventilation, however, where
the inflation-producing change in pressure is a reduction
in the pressure surrounding the respiratory system
(ΔPneg), the following applies:
−ΔPpl ¼ ΔPneg⋅ Ew
Etot
ð2Þ
Note that, in ARDS, the EW/Etot ratio averages 0.7, but
may range from 0.2 to 0.8 [8].
Obviously, in the presence of an artificial ventilation
mode where positive pressure may work simultaneously
with muscular efforts ( ΔPmuscÞ
(Table 1), the actual
changes of pleural pressure result from two ‘push–pull’
forces. Accordingly:
ΔPpl ¼ ΔPaw⋅ Ew
Etot
−ΔPmusc⋅ EL
Etot
ð3Þ
Positive pleural pressure
For passive inflation by a given airway pressure, the
pleural pressure will increase far more in the presence of
elevated chest wall elastance (i.e., elevated EW/Etot), as in
some cases of extreme obesity [9], whereas it will in-
crease far less in the presence of elevated lung elastance
(i.e., low EW/Etot; see Eq. (1)). All equations to which we
refer only approximate what is actually happening in the
pleural space, because in reality the pleural pressure is
not uniform along the thoracic cage, but rather depends
on several factors, such as gravitational gradients and
local pressure distortions arising from anatomical differ-
ences in the shapes of the lung and its chest wall enclos-
ure
[10].
Despite
the
limitations
in
accurately
determining pleural pressure [11, 12], its changing value
influences central vascular pressures and venous return.
A large experimental and clinical literature describes all
of the possible complications related to ventilation-
caused decreases of effective circulating volume. These
are particularly likely to occur when pleural pressure re-
mains positive throughout the entire respiratory cycle, as
during ventilation with positive end-expiratory pressure
(PEEP) [13]. The kidney [14], liver [15], and bowel [16,
17] may all be impaired or damaged by the resulting
venous congestion and reduced perfusion.
Negative pleural pressure
Excessively negative pleural pressure may arise during
spontaneous breathing, especially when vigorous respira-
tory effort is applied to a ‘stiff lung’ (see Eq. (3)). In
ARDS, for example, negative swings in esophageal pres-
sure may exceed 20–25 cmH2O, due to profoundly dys-
regulated respiratory drive [18]. Apart from increasing
the work of breathing and oxygen consumption, such
excessively negative intrathoracic and interstitial pres-
sures promote venous return and increase edema forma-
tion. Such phenomena, well described by Barach et al. in
1938 [19], have deservedly been reemphasized for the

 current era of positive pressure ventilation [20]. Recent
work has demonstrated that pedelluft phenomena which
occur during vigorous breathing efforts in injured lungs
have the potential to amplify local strains and could con-
ceivably contribute to tissue damage [21–23]. In con-
cept, certain asynchronies between the patient and
ventilator (e.g., double triggering and breath stacking)
may also be injurious when they occur frequently and/or
in groups.
Adverse effects associated with transpulmonary pressure
The adverse effects of excessive transpulmonary pressure
were recognized soon after mechanical ventilation was
first applied in patients with ARDS [24]. In those early
years the initial therapeutic targets were to maintain
normal blood gases and to avoid dyssynchrony while
limiting the use of muscle relaxants, which understand-
ably were considered hazardous when using the poorly
alarmed ventilators of that era. Consequently, tidal vol-
umes and respiratory rates were typically 15 ml/kg and
15–20 bpm, respectively [25]. Using this approach, few
patients fought the ventilator, but barotrauma (primarily
pneumothorax) occurred quickly and commonly. This
event was so frequent that preventive use of bilateral
chest tubes was suggested when ventilation for ARDS
was initiated [26]. ‘Barotrauma’ was used to collectively
identify the clinically recognizable problems of gas
escape: pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, interstitial
emphysema [27–30], gas embolism [31], etc. Used in a
broader sense, however, barotrauma also includes VILI.
A different viewpoint was elaborated by Dreyfuss et al.
[32], who emphasized the role of lung distention (strain)
as opposed to airway pressure. High airway pressures
were applied without excessive lung strain or damage by
restricting chest wall movement. Conversely, injury
(‘volutrauma’) was inflicted by similar airway pressures
in the absence of chest wall restraint. Barotrauma and
volutrauma, however, are two faces of the same coin if
we consider that the force distending the lung is not the
airway pressure, but the transpulmonary pressure (i.e.,
Paw – Ppl). This variable more accurately reflects the
stress applied to lung structures. Indeed, the following
relationship holds [7]:
PL ¼ ELspec⋅ ΔV
FRC
ð4Þ
Here, ΔV is the change in lung volume in reference to
its resting (unstressed) value, functional residual capacity
(FRC), and ELspec is the tissue elastance of the lung, elas-
tance referenced to the lung’s absolute inflation capacity.
In words, Eq. (4) can be expressed as:
Stress ¼ ELspec⋅Strain
ð5Þ
implying:

adverse consequences due to the progressive decrease or progressive increase of pleural pressure (ΔPpl). The key variation is the increase or
decrease of venous return, respectively. Right: sequence of possible damage when progressively increasing the transpulmonary pressure (ΔPL).
Either during negative pressure ventilation (here performed at baseline atmospheric pressure, i.e., 0 cmH2O) or during positive pressure
ventilation, ΔPL is always positive. See text for details. ΔPaw change in airway pressure
Gattinoni et al. Critical Care  (2017) 21:183 
Page 3 of 11
 Barotrauma ¼ k⋅Volutrauma
ð6Þ
Therefore, stress and strain are related by a propor-
tionality constant, equivalent to specific elastance ELspec.
This value, which is similar in normal subjects and in
acute lung injury patients, averages ~12 cmH2O [8]. In
other words, 12 cmH2O is the stress developed in lung
structures when the resting volume (FRC) is doubled.
Indeed, at total inspiratory capacity the stress would be
~24 cmH2O because the ΔV/FRC ratio is then ~2. Ex-
perimental studies indicate that barotrauma/volutrauma
requires some regions of the lung to reach the ‘their
own’ total lung capacity [33]. At this level, the collagen
framework is fully distended and works as a ‘stop length’
restraint. These concepts are summarized in Fig. 2 and
form
a
basis
for
understanding
barotrauma
and
volutrauma.
Volutrauma
In comparative studies investigating the role of volu-
trauma on outcome, tidal volume has usually been
expressed per kilogram of ideal (predicted) body weight
(PBW) in an attempt to relate tidal volume to the ex-
pected lung size. Unfortunately, due to the variability of
the aeratable lung size in ARDS (the concept of ‘baby
lung’ [34]), such normalization fails as a surrogate for
lung
strain.
Despite
these
limitations,
the
ARDS
Network [35] found a 9% survival benefit in an unse-
lected ARDS sample when using 6 ml/kg PBW tidal vol-
ume instead of 12 ml/kg PBW. Of note, this advantage
was also found in the quartile of patients with less severe
ARDS, where the ‘baby lung’ size was likely greater [36].
It seems plausible that the inverse correlation between
survival and dead space [37], as reflected by hypercapnia,
may relate to the relative sizes of the functioning baby
lungs and the strains that they undergo with ‘lung pro-
tective’ ventilation [38]. A tidal volume per kilogram ex-
ceeding 20–30 ml/kg is required to damage the healthy
lungs of experimental animals [39–43]. Although a dir-
ect comparison between healthy and ARDS lungs is
highly questionable, the mechanical characteristics of
the ‘baby lung’ (i.e., its specific compliance) are similar
to
those
of
normal subjects. The ARDS Network
mandate to avoid high tidal volumes deeply and appro-
priately influenced clinical practice. However, volu-
trauma may best be avoided by considering not simply
the tidal volume but the strain (i.e., the ratio of tidal vol-
ume to the resting lung volume). In this context, the re-
cently redirected focus on driving pressure (which
equals the ratio of tidal volume to compliance) rather
than on plateau pressure alone has a rough parallel with
this admonition [44]. We must also remind ourselves
that in prior randomized controlled trials [45–47], the
ARDS patients exposed to ~10 ml/kg tidal volume

shown, the doubling of the FRC occurs at a transpulmonary pressure of 12 cmH2O (specific elastance). We arbitrarily indicated the ‘risky’ zone of
PL as that which corresponds to lung strains exceeding 1.5 (based on experimental data [52]). PL transpulmonary pressure

 experienced better survival compared to patients ex-
posed to ~7 ml/kg. Therefore, decreases of tidal volume
below 6 ml/kg, as proposed for ‘ultraprotective ventila-
tion’
(associated
with
extracorporeal
CO2
removal)
would not necessarily be of benefit, because severe
hypoventilation and reabsorption atelectasis may offset
its putative advantages unless other preventative or com-
pensatory measures are taken to raise mean airway pres-
sure, with consequent increase of global lung stress [48,
49]. Attention should be paid to avoiding not only exces-
sively high strain, but also unphysiologically low strain.
Barotrauma
In the editorial accompanying the ARMA trial, 32
cmH2O plateau pressure was suggested as an upper
safety limit for (passive) mechanical ventilation [50].
Since then, the 30 cmH2O limit became infrequently
challenged dogma for both clinical practice and clinical
trials.
Actually,
in
a
normal
70-kg
human
(FRC
~2000 ml and compliance ~80 ml/cmH2O), the 30
cmH2O plateau would correspond to a tidal volume of
~2400 ml (strain = 1.2). In normal animals, this strain is
nearly harmless if applied at a respiratory rate of 15 bpm
for 54 hours [51]. The applied transpulmonary pressure
in this condition, assuming similar chest wall and lung
elastances, would be ~15 cmH2O (see Fig. 2). However,
as already stated, in ARDS the ratio between lung elas-
tance and the total respiratory system elastance may vary
from 0.2 to 0.8 [8]. Because the transpulmonary pressure
equals the applied airway pressure times the EL/Etot ra-
tio, the ‘safe’ 30 cmH2O may result in a transpulmonary
pressure as low as 6 cmH2O or as high as 24 cmH2O, a
value approaching that needed to reach total lung cap-
acity (Fig. 2), and may be lethal to animals [52]. There-
fore, the use of 30 cmH2O, in a given subset of patients
may
result
either
in
excessive
strain
or
in
hypoventilation and hypoxemia. This was likely the case
of many patients with low EL/Etot ratios (i.e., pregnant
women or obese patients) during the H1N1 epidemics in
Australia and New Zealand [53]. In some of those pa-
tients, ECMO perhaps could have been avoided, simply
by safely increasing the plateau pressure, as we found in
a cohort of H1N1 patients (ECMO candidates), where
low EL/Etot was documented [54]. Just as for volutrauma
it is wiser to consider strain instead of the tidal volume,
for barotrauma it is wiser to consider transpulmonary
pressure instead of plateau airway pressure (see Eq. (6)).
Consequences associated with other ventilatory variables
Although most of the studies dealing with VILI concen-
trate on the static components of the breath (tidal vol-
ume, plateau pressure, and PEEP), other important
factors should not be ignored. The most relevant, in our
opinion, are the respiratory rate (i.e., how many times
per minute a potential volutrauma or barotrauma is de-
livered) and the inspiratory flow rate (i.e., how fast a po-
tential volutrauma or barotrauma is applied).
Respiratory rate
The respiratory rate has been considered relatively in-
consequential, because it is usually set to maintain
PaCO2 within an acceptable range. Thus, in the mile-
stone ARDS Network trial, the lower tidal volume was
associated with a respiratory rate of 29 bpm, compared
to 16 bpm in the higher tidal volume group. Nonethe-
less, under certain conditions the respiratory rate is un-
likely to be innocent in the genesis of VILI. The harm
resulting from raising the respiratory rate is almost cer-
tain to be conditioned by the dynamic stress of the indi-
vidual tidal cycle [55]. The analogy with metal fatigue,
which is a function of the number of high stress cycles,
may help to frame the role of respiratory rate as codeter-
minant of VILI. Both in isolated lungs and large-size ani-
mals, reducing the respiratory rate provides definite
advantages in reducing VILI [56, 57]. Conversely, when
operated in an elevated pressure range, perhaps high-
frequency ventilation with small tidal volumes may in-
flict damage [58].
Inspiratory flow
The potential for high inspiratory flow to contribute to
VILI likely relates to locally intensified concentration of
stress, a problem influenced by viscoelastic tissue prop-
erties. Experimental literature consistently shows that,
for a given plateau pressure, or a given strain, the rate at
which the volume was delivered (i.e., the inspiratory
flow) plays a definite role in the genesis of VILI [33, 59–
61]. Although one would logically expect that any dam-
age attributed to high inspiratory flow should primarily
concentrate in the airway, high inspiratory flow accentu-
ates damage to the lung parenchyma, in all likelihood
because
viscoelastic
accommodation
has
insufficient
time to dissipate damaging forces when inflation occurs
quickly. Flow rate assumes a greater role in a mechanic-
ally inhomogeneous lung (e.g., ARDS) than in a homoge-
neous one. Moreover, a tidal volume delivered by
pressure control could be more dangerous than if
achieved by flow-controlled, volume-cycled ventilation
with constant flow, because in the former the peak in-
spiratory flow may reach far higher values. Finally, al-
though little studied, control of expiratory flow may
potentially
attenuate
microatelectasis
and
influence
stresses that occur as tissues rearrange themselves dur-
ing deflation.

 observational studies presented are the 2002 study by
Esteban et al. [62], the 2011 study by Villar et al. [63],
and the 2016 study by Bellani et al. [64]. These three
studies include unselected ARDS patients and should re-
flect daily practice. For comparison, we added the venti-
latory treatments and outcomes of patients enrolled in
randomized trials, filtered through exclusion criteria
from a wider ARDS population. In comparison to tidal
volume, more attention seems to have been paid to the
plateau pressure, which has been held consistently below
30 cmH2O after the ARDS Network ARMA trial. The
respiratory rate did not change remarkably, because it
seems to be dictated by the aim of maintaining PaCO2
within normal limits of 35–45 mmHg. PEEP values con-
sistently averaged 7–8 cmH2O, with levels up to 15
cmH2O systematically applied only in clinical trials.
Considering the ventilatory data reported in the largest
and most recent survey by Bellani et al. [64], we may
wonder what mortality fraction is attributable to VILI in
patients ventilated with tidal volume of 7.6 ml/kg PBW,
respiratory rate of 18.6 bpm, and PEEP of 8.4 cmH2O.
To date, we do not believe it is possible to answer this
question, which is of paramount importance in improv-
ing future mechanical ventilation. Indeed, if the mortal-
ity attributable to VILI is now already very low, we
cannot expect any great improvement from modifying
our current ventilatory practice. We must first better
understand the roles played by the mechanical ventila-
tor’s settings, the underlying lung pathophysiology, and
their interaction.
The future of mechanical ventilation
Ideally, mechanical ventilation should be applied so as to
avoid all adverse side effects, including VILI. To ration-
ally approach this task, we believe it necessary to
characterize much better than we do now the patho-
physiology of the lung parenchyma to which the mech-
anical ventilation is applied and to fully understand the
potential harm of each component of the ventilatory set.
Lung-related causes of VILI
The primary conditions influencing the occurrence of
VILI are baby lung size, parenchymal recruitability, and
extent of lung inhomogeneity. The routine measurement
of the lung size would allow the assessment of average
lung strain. The precise assessment of recruitability,
which currently requires imaging techniques, will facili-
tate both increasing functional lung size and preventing/
limiting atelectrauma by selecting ‘adequate’ PEEP. Lung
inhomogeneity likely promotes VILI. In healthy animals,
VILI requires tidal volumes as high as 30–40 ml/kg [39–
43, 51]. In contrast, 12 ml/kg appear sufficient, in ARDS
patients, even in those with better lung compliance (i.e.,
with likely greater lung size) [36]. Because the possible
alterations within the baby lung (i.e., a deficit of surfac-
tant, the presence of some edema, and fibrosis in the
extracellular matrix) are per se protective against exces-
sive strain, additional factors seem necessary to account
for the damage. These may be the lung parenchyma in-
homogeneities that locally increase the stress and strain
(stress raisers). In the classic theoretical model of Mead
et al. [65], the inhomogeneity occurring at the interface
between a fully open unit (volume = 10) and a fully
closed unit (volume = 1) will cause a pressure rise pro-
portional to the exponent 2/3 of their ratio (i.e., (10/1)2/
3). The proposed exponent of 2/3 is an approximation to
convert volume (cm3) to surface area (cm2), as stress re-
lates to surface area (force divided by surface area). Be-
cause 102/3 = 4.64, an applied pressure at the airway of
30 cmH2O would result, according to the Mead et al.
model, in a local tension approximating a pressure of
~140 cmH2O applied to a fully homogeneous and open
lung. When we estimated lung inhomogeneity with a CT
scan, we found that the multiplication factor between
units with different volumes is ~2, but more than
enough to locally expand some units to their own TLC
[66]. More than 40% of the lung volume in severe ARDS
may be subject to this stress-raising phenomenon, em-
phasizing the importance of designing maneuvers able
to decrease lung inhomogeneity.
Ventilator-related causes of VILI: the mechanical power
All of these mechanical factors discussed separately (vol-
ume, pressure, rate, and flow) can be considered parts of
a single physical entity: the mechanical power. The
equation describing power (Fig. 3) may be easily derived
by multiplying the classical equation of motion by the
tidal volume and respiratory rate [67]. Indeed, the energy
cost per cycle is computed as the product of pressure
times the change of volume, which, when multiplied by
the respiratory rate, gives the power value (energy/unit
of time). Total pressure is spent in performing elastic
work (elastance times tidal volume), in moving gas (flow
times resistance), and in maintaining end-expiratory
lung volume (by PEEP). If each of these elements is
multiplied by the tidal volume, the energy per breath is
obtained, and by multiplying this by the respiratory rate
we obtain the mechanical power. This equation is pre-
sented in this extended form, instead of other possible
simplified versions [67], to illustrate item by item the de-
terminants of power. A comparison of exponents indi-
cates that tidal volume (and its associated driving
pressure) and inspiratory flow are quantitatively potent
determinants ( Powerrs ¼ k � ΔV 2
and
Powerrs ¼ k
�flow2 ), followed by the respiratory rate ( Powerrs ¼ k
�RR1:4), and then by PEEP, elastance, and resistance (all
three linearly correlated with the mechanical power).

 Clearly, reduction of ventilatory demand to reduce tidal
volume, flow, and/or respiratory rate should be priori-
tized if applying damaging power is to be avoided.
Although the concept of mechanical power may ap-
peal as a unifying variable with which to track VILI risk
(both
during
controlled
and spontaneously assisted
breathing), several challenges must be met before it can
be
implemented
in
practice:
first,
power must be
normalized either for a standard lung volume or for the
amount of aerated lung tissue [68, 69]; and second, the
relationship between the power delivered to the whole
respiratory system and that actually delivered to the lung
(using the transpulmonary pressure) must be differenti-
ated. In particular, the impact of inspiratory flow and tis-
sue resistance should be better defined. From a practical
perspective, even if appropriately adjusted for resistance,
Fig. 3 Upper box: simplified equation of motion, showing that, at any given moment, the pressure in the respiratory system (P) above the relaxed
volume equals the sum of the elastic pressure (elastance of the respiratory system Ers times change in lung volume), plus the pressure needed to
move the gases (flow F times airway resistance), plus the pressure (if any) to keep the lung pressure above the atmospheric pressure at end
expiration (PEEP). If each of these three components is multiplied by the tidal change in lung volume ΔV, the energy per breath is obtained. If
multiplied by the respiratory rate, the corresponding power equation is obtained. 0.098 is the conversion factor from liters/cmH2O to Joules (J). I:E

Fig. 4 Left: baseline energy (red hatched triangle ABE), on which the inspiratory energy associated with the tidal volume (area BCDE) is added.
Yellow hatched area to the right of line BC represents the inspiratory dissipated energy needed to move the gas, to overcome surface tension
forces, to make the extracellular sheets slide across one another (tissue resistances), and possibly to reinflate collapsed pulmonary units. Light
green hatched area on the left of line BC defines the elastic energy (trapezoid EBCD) cyclically added to the respiratory system during inspiration.
Total area included in the triangle ACD is the total energy level present in the respiratory system at end inspiration. Right: energy changes during
expiration. Of the total energy accumulated at end inspiration (triangle ACD), the area of the trapezoid EBCD is the energy released during
expiration. The fraction of energy included in the hysteresis area (light blue hatched area) is dissipated into the respiratory system, while the
remaining area (dark blue hatched area) is energy dissipated into the atmosphere through the connecting circuit. Note that whatever maneuver
(as controlled expiration) reduces the hysteresis area will reduce the energy dissipated into the respiratory system (potentially dangerous?). PEEP

 flow, and chest wall elastance, any estimate of lung-
delivered power made using airway pressure alone dur-
ing spontaneous efforts would reflect only the machine’s
contribution to the total energy imparted during infla-
tion [33]. In addition, the distribution of mechanical
power throughout the lung parenchyma must be deter-
mined. We do not know whether it follows the same
maldistribution of stress and strain dictated by lung in-
homogeneity [66]. Finally, mechanical power as defined
here relates to the inspiratory phase; it is very possible
that the expiratory phase may also play a role. Indeed,
all of the energy accumulated at end inspiration must
have dissipated both into the lung structures and the at-
mosphere when exhalation is complete. It is interesting
and potentially important to know whether controlling
expiratory flow (which decreases the fraction of energy
expended into the lung) thereby helps to reduce VILI.
Actually, such a phenomenon has been reported in two
studies not normally considered in the VILI literature
[70, 71]. Fig. 4 summarizes all of these concepts, and
also suggests a slightly different nomenclature which we
believe
to
be
less
confusing
than
that
currently
employed.
Conclusion
To minimize adverse interactions between lung path-
ology and ventilatory settings that promote VILI requires
two distinct strategies: on one side, decreasing the in-
spiratory (and possibly the expiratory) mechanical power
and damaging strain should decrease VILI; and on the
other, steps to increase lung homogeneity should de-
crease the likelihood of injury. The best available maneu-
ver to encourage mechanical homogeneity, supported by
solid pathophysiological background [72] and proven
clinical results, is prone positioning for those patients in
whom inhomogeneity is prevalent (moderate-severe and
severe ARDS) [73].
In conclusion, we believe that a possible pathway to-
ward ‘improved’ mechanical ventilation for a future pa-
tient would consist of the following steps:
� Define excessive strain and mechanical power,
normalized for lung volume.
� Measure/estimate lung inhomogeneity to assess the
prevalence of stress raisers and the distribution of
mechanical power/stress–strain.
� Determine whether a given ventilatory set applied to
the lung parenchyma of which the mechanical
characteristics are known is associated with risk of
VILI and how much.
� If a mechanical ventilation set cannot be found to
avoid an excessive risk of VILI, alternative methods
(as the artificial lung) should be considered.
