BACKGROUND
Fremanezumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting calcitonin gene–related 
peptide (CGRP), is being investigated as a preventive treatment for migraine. We com-
pared two fremanezumab dose regimens with placebo for the prevention of chronic 
migraine.
METHODS
In this phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned patients with chronic migraine (defined 
as headache of any duration or severity on ≥15 days per month and migraine on 
≥8 days per month) in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive fremanezumab quarterly (a single 
dose of 675 mg at baseline and placebo at weeks 4 and 8), fremanezumab month-
ly (675 mg at baseline and 225 mg at weeks 4 and 8), or matching placebo. Both 
fremanezumab and placebo were administered by means of subcutaneous injec-
tion. The primary end point was the mean change from baseline in the average 
number of headache days (defined as days in which headache pain lasted ≥4 consecu-
tive hours and had a peak severity of at least a moderate level or days in which acute 
migraine–specific medication [triptans or ergots] was used to treat a headache of any 
severity or duration) per month during the 12 weeks after the first dose.
RESULTS
Of 1130 patients enrolled, 376 were randomly assigned to fremanezumab quarterly, 
379 to fremanezumab monthly, and 375 to placebo. The mean number of baseline 
headache days (as defined above) per month was 13.2, 12.8, and 13.3, respectively. 
The least-squares mean (±SE) reduction in the average number of headache days 
per month was 4.3±0.3 with fremanezumab quarterly, 4.6±0.3 with fremanezumab 
monthly, and 2.5±0.3 with placebo (P<0.001 for both comparisons with placebo). 
The percentage of patients with a reduction of at least 50% in the average number 
of headache days per month was 38% in the fremanezumab-quarterly group, 41% in 
the fremanezu 
mab-monthly group, and 18% in the placebo group (P<0.001 for both 
comparisons with placebo). Abnormalities of hepatic function occurred in 5 patients 
in each fremanezumab group (1%) and 3 patients in the placebo group (<1%).
CONCLUSIONS
Fremanezumab as a preventive treatment for chronic migraine resulted in a lower 
frequency of headache than placebo in this 12-week trial. Injection-site reactions 
to the drug were common. The long-term durability and safety of fremanezumab 
require further study. (Funded by Teva Pharmaceuticals; ClinicalTrials.gov number, 
NCT02621931.)

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
M
igraine is a complex neurologic 
disorder that is characterized primarily 
by recurrent attacks of pulsating head-
ache pain of at least moderate severity.1,2 It has a 
global prevalence of 15 to 18% and is a leading 
cause of disability worldwide.3 Chronic migraine, 
occurring in approximately 2% of the popula-
tion, has been defined as the occurrence of at 
least 15 days with headache per month for at least 
3 months.2,4 With daily or near-daily attacks, per-
sons with chronic migraine have functional im-
pairment and a lower quality of life than those 
with less-frequent migraine.4 Expert opinion has 
been that patients with chronic migraine should 
receive preventive treatment2,5,6; however, these 
treatments may be underused, not adhered to, as-
sociated with side effects, or ineffective.7,8
Fremanezumab (TEV-48125) is a humanized 
IgG2a monoclonal antibody that selectively and 
potently binds to calcitonin gene–related peptide 
(CGRP),9,10 a 37–amino acid neuropeptide involved 
in central and peripheral pathophysiological events 
of migraine.11-13 Fremanezumab targets both α and 
β isoforms of the CGRP ligand (not the recep-
tor), has flexible dosing, and is administered by 
means of subcutaneous injection.9,10 In a phase 2 
trial involving patients with chronic migraine, the 
numbers of migraine days and headache days 
were significantly lower with fremanezumab than 
with placebo, and no serious treatment-related 
adverse events occurred.14 We conducted a 16-
week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-con-
trolled, phase 3 trial with a 12-week active-inter-
vention phase to evaluate the efficacy, safety, 
and side-effect profile of two subcutaneous dose 
regimens of fremanezumab for the preventive 
treatment of chronic migraine.
Methods
Trial Oversight
The protocol, available with the full text of this 
article at NEJM.org, was approved by relevant eth-
ics committees and institutional review boards. 
The authors vouch for the conduct of the trial, 
adherence to the protocol, and the accuracy and 
completeness of the data and analyses and the 
reporting of adverse events. The trial complied 
with the International Conference on Harmoni-
sation Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice, the 
principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, and rel-
evant national and local regulations. At the time of 
screening, participants signed consent forms for 
both this trial and a concurrent trial of frema-
nezumab for episodic migraine (ClinicalTrials.gov 
number, NCT02629861). The trial sponsor, Teva 
Pharmaceuticals, provided the trial medication, 
performed the data analysis, and funded the trial. 
Assistance with manuscript preparation was pro-
vided by a medical writer funded by the sponsor.
Trial Participants
Patients were recruited at 132 sites in nine coun-
tries from March 2016 through January 2017. 
These sites were clinics caring for persons with 
headaches, and potential participants were iden-
tified from their databases. Key inclusion criteria 
were an age of 18 to 70 years, a history of migraine 
(according to the criteria of the International Clas-
sification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition 
[beta version], or ICHD-3 beta) for at least 12 
months, and the fulfillment of the criteria for 
chronic migraine during the 28-day preinterven-
tion period (headache of any duration or severity 
on ≥15 days and headache meeting ICHD-3 beta 
criteria for migraine on ≥8 days). The protocol 
allowed inclusion of up to 30% of patients using 
a stable dose of one migraine-preventive medica-
tion (hereafter referred to as preventive medica-
tion) for at least 2 months before the beginning 
of the preintervention period to continue these 
medications.
Key exclusion criteria were the use of ona-
botulinumtoxinA during the 4 months before 
screening; the use of interventions or devices for 
migraine, such as nerve blocks and transcranial 
magnetic stimulation, during the 2 months be-
fore screening; the use of opioid or barbiturate 
medications on more than 4 days during the pre-
intervention period; and a lack of efficacy, after an 
adequate therapeutic trial, of at least two of four 
clusters of preventive medications, the details of 
which are provided in the protocol.
Trial Design
This randomized, double-blind, placebo-con-
trolled, parallel-group trial consisted of a screen-
ing visit, a 28-day preintervention period, and a 
12-week intervention period, with a final evalu-
ation at week 12. On the basis of the screening 
visit and information collected in a daily diary 
during the preintervention period, patients were 
enrolled in the appropriate trial or were excluded 
if they were not eligible for either trial.

Fremanezumab for the Prevention of Chronic Migraine
Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 
1:1:1 ratio to receive fremanezumab quarterly, 
fremanezumab monthly, or placebo. All the pa-
tients received three abdominal subcutaneous 
injections at baseline and one injection at weeks 
4 and 8. In the fremanezumab-quarterly group, 
patients received a single dose of 675 mg of 
fremanezumab at baseline (three injections of 
225 mg per 1.5 ml), followed at weeks 4 and 8 by 
placebo (one 1.5-ml injection). In the fremanez-
umab-monthly group, patients received 675 mg 
of fremanezumab at baseline (as above) and 
225 mg of fremanezumab at weeks 4 and 8 (one 
injection of 225 mg per 1.5 ml). In the placebo 
group, placebo was administered as three 1.5-ml 
injections at baseline and one 1.5-ml injection at 
weeks 4 and 8. Randomization was performed 
by means of electronic interactive-response tech-
nology, with stratification according to sex, coun-
try, and baseline use of preventive medication (yes 
or no). Patients, investigators, the sponsor, and 
trial staff were unaware of the trial-group assign-
ments.
Patients were seen at five scheduled visits for 
protocol-specified evaluations: at screening, base-
line, weeks 4 and 8, and week 12, or at the time 
of early withdrawal from the trial. Patients who 
withdrew prematurely had final protocol-speci-
fied evaluations performed as soon as possible 
after withdrawal. Headache data (e.g., occurrence, 
duration, and pain severity; occurrence of photo-
phobia, phonophobia, nausea, or vomiting; and 
any use of migraine medication) were captured 
daily through an electronic headache-diary device 
(ERT DIARYpro platform on the Bluebird Pidion 
BM-170 device).
Trial End Points
The primary end point was the mean change in 
the average number of headache days (days in 
which headache pain lasted ≥4 consecutive hours 
and had a peak severity of at least a moderate 
level or days in which acute migraine–specific 
medication [triptans or ergots] was used to treat 
a headache of any severity or duration) per month, 
comparing the baseline 28-day preintervention 
period with the 12-week period after the first dose 
of the trial regimen.
Secondary end points were the mean change 
from baseline in the average number of migraine 
days per month, the percentage of patients with 
a reduction of at least 50% in the average number 
of headache days per month, and the mean change 
from baseline in the average number of days per 
month in which acute headache medication was 
used during the 12-week period after the first 
dose. A migraine day was defined as a calendar 
day in which headache pain lasted at least 4 con-
secutive hours and met criteria for migraine (with 
or without aura) or probable migraine (subtype in 
which only one migraine criterion is absent), or 
a day in which acute migraine–specific medication 
(triptans or ergots) was used to treat a headache of 
any duration. Other secondary end points included 
the mean change from baseline in the number of 
headache days during the 4-week period after 
the first dose in all the patients and during the 
12-week period after the first dose in patients 
not receiving concomitant preventive medica-
tion, as well as the mean change in the score on 
the six-item Headache Impact Test (HIT-6; scores 
range from 36 to 78, with higher scores indicat-
ing a greater degree of headache-related disabil-
ity)15 from baseline (day 0) to 4 weeks after ad-
ministration of the last dose of the trial regimen.
Safety and side-effect profiles were evaluated 
according to reported adverse events, vital signs 
(systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse, body 
temperature, and respiratory rate), physical ex-
amination, 12-lead electrocardiography, clinical 
laboratory tests (serum chemical, hematologic, 
coagulation, and urinalysis tests), systematic as-
sessments of local injection-site reactions (ery-
thema, induration, ecchymosis, and pain, all evalu-
ated both immediately and 1 hour after dose 
administration), concomitant medication use, and 
suicidal ideation and behavior as assessed by 
means of scores on the electronic Columbia–Sui-
cide Severity Rating Scale. Serum levels of anti-
drug antibodies were assessed with the use of a 
validated method.
Statistical Analysis
Estimations based on the phase 2b trial of 
fremanezumab in chronic migraine14 predicted 
that a sample of 867 patients who had completed 
the trial and could be evaluated would provide 
90% power to detect a mean (±SD) difference of 
1.7±6.3 in the average number of headache days 
per month between the fremanezumab-monthly 
group and the placebo group at a two-sided al-
pha level of 0.05. With an anticipated rate of 
discontinuation of 15%, 1020 participants were 
planned for randomization in this trial. Efficacy

analyses were conducted in the modified inten-
tion-to-treat population, which included all ran-
domly assigned patients who received at least one 
dose of a trial regimen and had at least 10 days of 
postbaseline efficacy assessments regarding the 
primary end point. Safety analyses included all 
randomly assigned patients who received at least 
one dose of a trial regimen.
The primary end point was analyzed with the 
use of an analysis of covariance. Trial regimen, 
sex, country, and baseline use of preventive medi-
cation (yes or no) were used as fixed effects, and 
the baseline number of migraine days and of years 
since the onset of migraines were covariates. We 
calculated 95% confidence intervals for the least-
squares mean differences between each frema-
nezumab group and the placebo group. The Wil-
coxon rank-sum test was performed as the 
primary analysis if there was deviation from the 
normality assumption as assessed by means of 
the Shapiro–Wilk test. For management of miss-
ing data in the primary analysis, the average 
number of headache days per month during the 
12-week period was prorated to a 28-day equiva-
lent with the use of all postbaseline observations. 
The same analyses were used for relevant sec-
ondary end points. For the percentage of patients 
with a reduction of at least 50% in the average 
number of headache days per month, the Co-
chran–Mantel–Haenszel test was used, with base-
line use of preventive medication (yes or no) as a 
stratification variable.
To control the type I statistical error rate at 
0.05, a hierarchical testing procedure was applied, 
with a prespecified sequence of comparisons be-
ginning with the primary end point and proceed-
ing to secondary end points in the order given in 
the protocol. Each comparison was performed 
only if the preceding comparison had a two-sided 
P value of 0.05 or less. Results are presented in 
the sequence in which end points were evaluated.
Results
Patients
A total of 1130 patients were randomly assigned 
to one of the three trial regimens: 376 to frema-
nezumab quarterly, 379 to fremanezumab month-
ly, and 375 to placebo (Fig. S1 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix, available at NEJM.org). Baseline 
demographic and clinical characteristics were 
similar among the three groups (Table 1). The 
mean number of baseline headache days (as de-
fined above) per month was 13.2 in the fremanezu-
mab-quarterly group, 12.8 in the fremanezumab-
monthly group, and 13.3 in the placebo group. 
Of the randomly assigned patients, 1034 com-
pleted the trial: 349 (93%) in the fremanezumab-
quarterly group, 343 (91%) in the fremanezu-
mab-monthly group, and 342 (91%) in the placebo 
group (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Efficacy
With respect to the primary end point, the mean 
(±SE) number of headache days per month was 
reduced by 4.3±0.3 days in the fremanezumab-
quarterly group, 4.6±0.3 days in the fremanez-
umab-monthly group, and 2.5±0.3 days in the 
placebo group (P<0.001 for both comparisons 
with placebo) (Table 2 and Fig. 1A). For the 12 
weeks of the intervention period, patients receiv-
ing placebo had an average of 10.4±6.4 headache 
days, as compared with 8.5±6.3 days for those 
receiving fremanezumab quarterly and 8.0±6.3 
days for those receiving fremanezumab monthly.
There was a larger reduction in the average 
number of migraine days per month with frema-
nezumab quarterly (by 4.9±0.4 days) and frema-
nezumab monthly (by 5.0±0.4 days) than with 
placebo (by 3.2±0.4 days) (P<0.001 for both com-
parisons with placebo) (Table 2 and Fig. 1B). 
Significantly more patients who received frema-
nezumab had a reduction of at least 50% in the 
average number of headache days per month 
(quarterly regimen, 38%; monthly regimen, 41%) 
than did patients who received placebo (18%) 
(P<0.001 for both comparisons with placebo) (Ta-
ble 2). There was a larger reduction in the aver-
age number of days per month in which acute 
headache medication was used in the fremanez-
umab groups (by 3.7±0.3 days with the quarterly 
regimen and by 4.2±0.3 days with the monthly 
regimen) than in the placebo group (by 1.9±0.3 
days) (P<0.001 for both comparisons with pla-
cebo) (Table 2).
Treatment effects were observed in the aver-
age number of headache days per month during 
the 4-week period after the first dose for all the 
patients and during the 12-week period after the 
first dose in the subgroup of patients not receiv-
ing concomitant preventive medication (P<0.001 
for all comparisons with placebo) (Table 2). The 
degree of headache-related disability decreased 
between baseline and the 4-week period after

the last dose, with significantly greater reductions 
in HIT-6 scores with fremanezumab quarterly 
(by 6.4±0.5 points) and fremanezumab monthly 
(by 6.8±0.4 points) than with placebo (by 4.5±0.5 
points) (P<0.001 for both comparisons with pla-
cebo) (Table 2).
Safety
Adverse events were reported for 64% of the pa-
tients receiving placebo, 70% of those receiving 
fremanezumab quarterly (P 
= 
0.06 vs. placebo), and 
71% of those receiving fremanezumab monthly 
(P 
= 
0.03 vs. placebo) (Table 3). Events were mild 
to moderate in severity in 95 to 96% of the patients 
in the three groups. A total of 20 patients discon-
tinued the trial owing to adverse events, including 
1% in the fremanezumab-quarterly group, 2% in 
the fremanezumab-monthly group, and 2% in the 
placebo group.
Injection-site reactions were reported in 40% 
of the patients receiving placebo, 47% of those re-
ceiving fremanezumab quarterly (P 
= 
0.08 vs. pla-
cebo), and 47% of those receiving fremanezumab 
monthly (P 
= 
0.03 vs. placebo); the severity of in-
jection-site reactions did not differ significantly 
among the trial groups. The most common adverse 
event was injection-site pain, which occurred in 
30% of the patients in the fremanezumab-quar-
terly group, 26% of those in the fremanezumab-
monthly group, and 28% of those in the placebo

group (Table 3). Injection-site induration and 
erythema were more frequent with fremanezumab 
than with placebo.
Serious adverse events occurred in 2% of the 
patients given placebo, 1% of those given frema-
nezumab monthly, and less than 1% of those given 
fremanezumab quarterly (Table 3, and Table S2 
in the Supplementary Appendix). No serious ad-
verse event occurred in more than one patient. 
One death occurred in the fremanezumab-quar-
terly group, 69 days after the patient received 
fremanezumab at a dose of 675 mg, which was 
determined on the basis of an autopsy to be due 
to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 
Except for the event of fatal COPD, all serious 
adverse events resolved or were resolving by the 
end of the trial. One serious adverse event led to 
discontinuation of the trial; an event of suicidal 
ideation (assessed by the investigator as being 
moderate in severity and unrelated to the trial 
regimen) was reported in a patient in the frema-
nezumab-monthly group who had a history of 
depression.

Fremanezumab for the Prevention of Chronic Migraine
jury (aspartate aminotransferase or alanine trans-
aminase level ≥3 times the upper limit of the 
normal range, total bilirubin level ≥2 times the 
upper limit of the normal range, or international 
normalized ratio >1.5) occurred in three patients 
in the placebo group (<1%) and five patients in 
each of the fremanezumab groups (1%) (P 
= 
0.73 
for each fremanezumab group vs. placebo and 
P 
= 
0.56 for the combined fremanezumab groups 
vs. placebo) (Table 3). Eight patients (1%) who 
received fremanezumab had liver enzyme levels 
that were higher than normal but less than 3 to 
5 times the upper limit of the normal range, 
which were transient and reverted to normal 
levels without discontinuation of the trial regi-
men. None of these events were considered by 
investigators as being serious, and none led to 
discontinuation of the trial. All the patients with 
liver enzyme levels that were higher than normal 
but less than 3 to 5 times the upper limit of the 
normal range (in the placebo or fremanezumab 
groups) had used nonsteroidal antiinflammato-
ry drugs or acetaminophen frequently or had 
used antidepressants daily. Two patients receiv-
ing fremanezumab (<1%) had an aspartate ami-
notransferase or alanine transaminase level more 
than 5 times the upper limit of the normal range. 
One of these patients had an alanine transami-
nase level 6.5 times the upper limit of the normal 
range at a single visit, and the level normalized 
without intervention while the patient was re-
ceiving the trial regimen. The other patient had 
an alanine transaminase level 6 times the upper 
limit of the normal range at baseline as well as 
an elevated level at visit 4, while being treated for 
an upper respiratory tract infection with medica-
tions containing ethanol. Values normalized af-
ter discontinuation of the ethanol-containing drug, 
while the patient was still receiving the trial 
regimen.
No participants had anaphylaxis or a severe 
hypersensitivity reaction. Antidrug antibodies de-
veloped in two patients who received fremanez-
umab quarterly. No clinically significant changes 
in vital signs, physical-examination findings, or 
electrocardiographic results occurred in any of 
the trial groups.
Discussion
This phase 3 trial of fremanezumab in chronic 
migraine showed a significant benefit of frema-
nezumab over placebo with respect to the aver-
Figure 1. Primary and Secondary End Points.
Panel A shows the change from baseline in the average number of head-
ache days per month during the 12-week period after the first dose of the 
trial regimen (primary end point), and Panel B shows the change from 
baseline in the average number of migraine days per month during the  
12-week period after the first dose of the trial regimen (secondary end 
point). A headache day was defined as a calendar day in which headache 
pain lasted at least 4 consecutive hours and had a peak severity of at least 
a moderate level, or a day in which acute migraine–specific medication 
(triptans or ergots) was used to treat a headache of any severity or dura-
tion. A migraine day was defined as a calendar day in which headache pain 
lasted at least 4 consecutive hours and met criteria for migraine (with or 
without aura) or probable migraine (subtype in which only one migraine 
criterion is absent), or a day in which acute migraine–specific medication 
(triptans or ergots) was used to treat a headache of any duration. An aster-
isk denotes P = 0.006 for the comparison with placebo, and a dagger P<0.001 
for the comparison with placebo. I bars indicate standard errors. Changes 
from baseline to weeks 4, 8, and 12 are part of exploratory analyses.

age number of headache days per month (differ-
ence vs. placebo, approximately −2 days per month), 
the number of migraine days, and headache-relat-
ed disability. Treatment effects were seen within 
4 weeks after the initial dose.
These results are consistent with those of the 
phase 2b trial of fremanezumab in chronic mi-
graine,14,16 with early onset of efficacy and similar 
treatment effects for both the monthly and quar-
terly regimens, although no direct comparison 
between dose regimens was made. The primary 
end point as defined in this trial adhered to In-
ternational Headache Society recommendations 
and is identical to that used in the pivotal trials 
of onabotulinumtoxinA,17-19 a preventive therapy 
approved by the Food and Drug Administration 
for chronic migraine. Fremanez 
umab probably 
exerts clinical effects through inhibition of the 
migraine-specific target CGRP and, as a mono-

Fremanezumab for the Prevention of Chronic Migraine
that are distinct from those of other preventive 
treatments, including a half-life that supports a 
long duration of action and long intervals be-
tween doses.20
Discontinuation of the trial due to adverse 
events was infrequent, a finding consistent with 
those of previous trials.14 Fremanezumab was 
associated with a higher incidence of injection-site 
reactions than placebo, but the severity of such 
reactions did not differ significantly among the 
trial groups. Because systematic assessment of 
injection sites was required for 1 hour after dose 
administration, the rates of the specific injec-
tion-site reactions in this trial may have been 
higher than those previously reported. Frema-
nezumab, a monoclonal antibody, is not metabo-
lized in the liver and is eliminated through catabo-
lism to smaller peptides or amino acids.20 Mild 
transient elevations in liver enzyme levels occurred, 
and the levels reverted to normal without discon-
tinuation of the trial regimen. All the patients who 
had these elevations used concomitant medica-
tions with a potential to cause increases in liver 
enzyme levels. Endogenous CGRP is a vasodilator, 
but there were no hemodynamic changes with 
fremanezumab. There was one death from chron-
ic pulmonary disease and one case of suicidal 
ideation in patients receiving the active drug. 
The latter occurred in a patient with a history of 
depression and was judged not to be related to 
the trial drug.
The current trial was conducted in parallel 
with a trial evaluating fremanezumab in episodic 
migraine, allowing persons who were ineligible 
for one trial to be considered for the other. Al-
though the current trial included patients with a 
long history of disease and those who had previ-
ously not had a response to or were currently 
taking preventive medications, it did not include 
patients with more refractory disease — those 
who had not had a response to at least two clus-
ters of preventive medications or who had con-
tinuous headache. As in other clinical trials of 
migraine treatment, eligibility was still restrict-
ed to relatively healthy patients. Further studies 
will be needed to assess the safety and efficacy 
of fremanezumab in a population of patients 
with migraine and coexistent diseases. Although 
the ongoing extension of this trial will provide 
further insights on efficacy and necessary safety 
follow-up data, results are not yet available to 
assess the long-term effects of fremanezumab 
on safety.
This trial showed that fremanezumab, given 
monthly or quarterly as subcutaneous injections, 
was effective for the preventive treatment of chron-
ic migraine.
