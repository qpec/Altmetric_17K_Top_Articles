ABSTRACT
OBJECTIVE
To quantify the effects of varying opioid prescribing 
patterns after surgery on dependence, overdose, or 
abuse in an opioid naive population.
DESIGN
Retrospective cohort study.
SETTING
Surgical claims from a linked medical and pharmacy 
administrative database of 37 651 619 commercially 
insured patients between 2008 and 2016.
PARTICIPANTS
1 015 116 opioid naive patients undergoing surgery.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Use of oral opioids after discharge as defined by 
refills and total dosage and duration of use. The 
primary outcome was a composite of misuse identified 
by a diagnostic code for opioid dependence, abuse, 
or overdose.
RESULTS
568 612 (56.0%) patients received postoperative 
opioids, and a code for abuse was identified for 
5906 patients (0.6%, 183 per 100 000 person 
years). Total duration of opioid use was the strongest 
predictor of misuse, with each refill and additional 
week of opioid use associated with an adjusted 
increase in the rate of misuse of 44.0% (95% 
confidence interval 40.8% to 47.2%, P<0.001), and 
19.9% increase in hazard (18.5% to 21.4%, P<0.001), 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS
Each refill and week of opioid prescription is 
associated with a large increase in opioid misuse 
among opioid naive patients. The data from this 
study suggest that duration of the prescription 
rather than dosage is more strongly associated with 
ultimate misuse in the early postsurgical period. The 
analysis quantifies the association of prescribing 
choices on opioid misuse and identifies levers for 
possible impact.
Introduction
Since the early 2000s, age adjusted rates of opioid 
overdose have tripled and now rank as the leading 
cause of death related to unintentional injury.1 2 
Prescription drugs are implicated in most of the cases, 
as rates of opioid prescription quadrupled 3 4 and were 
paralleled by increasing rates of deaths from overdose. 
Non-fatal overdose events from prescription opioids 
account for 7-11 times more episodes than fatal 
overdoses2 5 and have similarly increased by more than 
50% over 10 years.6 Strikingly the majority of these 
non-fatal overdose episodes take place in patients 
identified as non-chronic (<90 days) opioid users.
Overprescribing of opioids is thought to be a major 
contributor,7 where two thirds of opioid misuse 
can be attributed to opioids obtained through a 
single physician.2 Overprescribing enables opioid 
diversion and increases the potential for addiction.8 
9 Surgical patients are nearly four times more 
likely to get post-discharge opioids than their non-
surgical counterparts. Orthopedic surgeons alone 
were responsible for 7.7% of opioid prescriptions 
in 2009.10 11 Despite these numbers, surgeons have 
yet to find the right balance of opioid prescriptions: 
between 3% and 10% of opioid naive patients become 
chronic users, and emerging research suggests that 
as many as 80% of prescribed pills in the remaining 
group of patients are unused.12
The lack of guidance around postsurgical opioid 
prescribing13 14 partially results from little being 
known about the effect of longer and larger regimens 
of post-discharge opioids. More directly, it is not 
known how prescription refills affect the long term 
likelihood of misusing opioids. Prominent authors 
have called for study into this issue6 15 16 to underpin 
future guidelines.17 Furthermore, evidence shows that 
any post-discharge use is a risk factor for multiple 
refills18 independent of the specific prescription.19 
In this study, we examined the association between 
opioid prescription refills after surgery and misuse in 
an opioid naive population.
Methods
Data source
We extracted information on surgical patients with 
medical and pharmacy insurance from a deidentified 
administrative database at Aetna, a commercial 
managed healthcare company. This database includes

Data included all medical and pharmacy claims during 
the study period.
Sample cohort
For this retrospective cohort study, the sample 
consisted of members who underwent surgery and 
had at least six months of medical insurance and three 
months of pharmacy insurance before surgery, as 
well as 90 days of pharmacy coverage and one year of 
medical coverage16 after surgery. For the index surgery 
we chose the first surgery for each database member 
that met criteria and after which no further surgery 
claims were filed for 90 days. Members were followed 
until they experienced an opioid related event or their 
last month of enrollment in the database.
A member was considered opioid naive and 
eligible for inclusion if his or her total opioid use in 
the 60 days before surgery was seven days or less.20 
Postsurgical opioid use was measured if the member 
filled a prescription for an included opioid within 30 
days of discharge. Use was considered to have stopped 
when either 30 days elapsed without a filled opioid 
prescription or a misuse diagnosis was observed.
We excluded patients with presurgical evidence of 
opioid or other non-specific forms of misuse in the 
six months before surgery (see supplemental eTable 
1 for a list of presurgical exclusion codes). Finally, we 
excluded a small subset of patients with missing data 
for any variable. Supplemental eFigure 1 summarizes 
the protocol and derivation of the sample.
Outcome measures
Surgical claims were identified by a comprehensive 
list of Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes 
associated with inpatient and outpatient surgery and 
specialty released by the National Surgical Quality 
Improvement Program of the American College of 
Surgeons in 2015.21 Organ based categories were 
derived from top level CPT headers (eg, 10030-19499 
for surgeries of the integumentary system).
The primary outcome was an ICD-9 (international 
classification of diseases, ninth revision) diagnosis 
code of opioid dependence, abuse, or overdose (see 
supplemental eTable 1). Opioid misuse was defined 
as the presence of at least one of these ICD codes after 
discharge and encompasses a composite of a wide 
range of forms of misuse. We included only diagnosis 
codes related specifically to prescription opioids.
Opioid use
Opioids were identified in the database as narcotic 
analgesics or narcotic analgesic combinations by 
therapeutic category from Cerner’s Multum Lexicon 
Drug Database.22 We used only non-injected drugs 
associated with the following primary ingredients: 
codeine, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, morphine, 
oxycodone, oxymorphone, and tramadol. Other less 
common opioids were excluded for low numbers 
or association with palliative care or dependence 
treatment. We determined the morphine milligram 
equivalent (MME) dosage for each opioid prescription, 
using standard conversions.23 To decrease the influence 
of extreme outliers while respecting variation in the 
literature, we truncated the daily dose at 350 MME/
day.24 Length of use was truncated at 90 plus one days, 
and number of refills was truncated at five.
Refill identification
A drug refill is a physical event of varying durations. 
As with the initial prescription, there is no standard 
refill dosage or duration. Thus, identification of the 
event is an artificial threshold marking continuation 
of opioid use. The event is also relevant because it 
requires patients to approach their care provider for 
further drugs. We therefore chose to identify refills in 
two ways. First, we counted the number of physical 
prescriptions filled after initial use. The first post-
discharge prescription was counted as the initial use 
and we included all subsequent prescriptions with 
less than a 30 day gap between prescriptions. Second, 
we identified total post-discharge use by duration and 
dosage. We determined the post-discharge duration 
of opioid use to be the total number of calendar days 
covered by a prescription for an opioid after discharge 
from the index surgical procedure. This identified the 
“cabinet supply” of opioids acquired by patients.25 We 
used a well described method26 to consider overlapping 
prescriptions as part of the same episode and an 
indication of a completed previous prescription at a 
higher dose. Accounting for overlapping prescriptions 
consisted of defining use as the total number of days of 
accumulated prescriptions minus overlap.
When a single discharge date was listed on all 
medical claims associated with the index surgery 
date, we used this as the official discharge date. When 
multiple discharge dates were present, we used the 
last date. If no discharge date was associated with any 
medical claim on the index surgery date, we used the 
surgery date as discharge date.
Statistical analysis
We analyzed the time until a misuse event over the entire 
study period. To compute raw rates of opioid misuse 
we used the total number of misuse events divided 
by total follow-up time. These are reported as cases 
per 100 000 person years. Weighted linear regression 
was used for unadjusted analysis of log transformed 
weekly rates of misuse, where each week was weighted 
according to sample size. For adjusted analysis of time 
until misuse event we used Cox proportional hazards 
models. Adjusted models included either refills or 
duration, as well as daily dose (MME/day), age, sex, 
US state of residence, surgery type by CPT top level 
grouping, surgery year, concurrent benzodiazepine 
use, and binary indicators of presurgical diagnoses 
potentially related to misuse. A single surgery might be 
associated with multiple surgery types, if multiple CPT 
codes were assigned.
We used penalized logistic regression to determine 
presurgical diagnoses of interest.27 In the model we 
included all 590 ICD-9 codes assigned to at least 0.5% 
of patients in the six months before surgery, as well 
 on 1 June 2019 by guest. Protected by copyright.

as age, sex, and surgery type. In total, we selected 
65 presurgical diagnosis codes (see supplemental 
eTable 2).
Weighted linear regression effects are reported 
as multiplicative percentage increases in rate, and 
Cox effects as multiplicative percentage increases 
in hazard or equivalently hazard ratios. Throughout 
we report two sided P values and 95% confidence 
intervals. All analyses were conducted using R 3.2.2 
(R Core Team).
To ensure that the effect we observed was driven by 
initial opioid use and not downstream unidentified 
factors, we performed sensitivity analyses restricted 
to one year postsurgery and to members with no 
additional surgeries during follow-up. For misuse 
events within one year, we used logistic regression to 
adjust for covariates.
To detect if structural factors owing to changing 
trends over time (year of surgery) or geography 
were influencing our estimates, we considered two 
additional sensitivity analyses: a Cox model including 
an interaction between duration and an indicator 
for year and a model including an interaction 
between duration and state of residence. Further 
sensitivity analysis attempted to mimic an unobserved 
confounder by creating a synthetic binary variable that 
was associated with both duration and opioid misuse. 
The binary variable was generated as a Bernoulli 
random variable (fig 1). To determine the extent to 
which strong unobserved confounding might explain 
the observed association, we included this synthetic 
confounder in a Cox model.
Patient involvement
No patients were involved in setting the research 
question or the outcome measures, nor were 
they involved in developing plans for design or 
implementation of the study. No patients were asked 
to advise on interpretation or writing up of results. 
There are no plans to disseminate the results of the 
research to study participants or the relevant patient 
community.
Results
Cohort characteristics
The study sample included 1 015 116 members who 
met study criteria and underwent an index surgery. 
Members were followed for a median of 2.67 years. 
After the index surgery, 568 612 members (56.0%) 
filled a prescription for a postoperative opioid. Ninety 
per cent of prescriptions were filled within three days 
of discharge. In the subsequent follow-up period, 
misuse was identified in 5906 members (0.6%, 183 
cases per 100 000 person years), with 1857 occurring 
within one year after surgery (0.2%).
Characteristics of the cohort followed national 
trends (table 1). Surgeries were more prevalent 
among older age groups, and younger groups had 
higher rates of opioid usage. The most common 
surgeries were for the musculoskeletal system 
(367 317 surgeries; 2448 misuse events; 206 cases 
per 100 000 person years), digestive system (293 905 
surgeries; 1825 misuse events; 198 cases per 
100 000 person years), and integumentary system 
(106 914 surgeries; 533 misuse events; 161 cases per 
100 000 person years). Rates of misuse by age group 
followed national patterns, with higher rates among 
younger men (fig 2A) and increasing rates over the 
study period (fig 2B).
Over the study period there were notable changes in 
the characteristics of opioid prescriptions and the rates 
of misuse (table 1). Postsurgical incidence of misuse 
increased from 183 cases per 100 000 person years 
(2009) to 269 cases per 100 000 person years (2014), 
whereas rates for opioid prescription fill plateaued and 
began to fall in the later years of the study (also see 
fig 2C). Median duration and median dose prescribed 
remained stable throughout the study period at about 
five days and 50 MME/day, respectively. These stable 
numbers masked a change in opioid prescription 
characteristics during the study period: fewer short 
course and increased numbers of longer duration 
prescriptions as well as a trend toward lower doses 
by episode (see figs 3B and 3D). Similar prescribing 
changes were detected for all surgery types (see 
supplemental eFigure 2).
Rates of misuse by opioid use
The number of post-discharge prescriptions best 
predicted eventual misuse. Overall rates of misuse 
were low, but rates grew rapidly with increasing opioid 
use. The rate of misuse more than doubled among 
those with one refill (86 654 (15.2%); 293 cases per 
100 000 person years) versus those with no refills 
(434 273 (76.2%); 145 cases per 100 000 person 
years). In total, each additional refill increased the rate 
of misuse by 70.7% (95% confidence interval 54.6% 
to 88.4%) before adjustment and increased the hazard 
of misuse by 44.0% (40.8% to 47.2%, P<0.001) after 
adjusting for covariates.
The relation between number of refills and misuse 
was further supported by evaluation of the number 
of days of opioid use post-discharge. Each additional 
week of opioid use was associated with an average 
increase in the rate of misuse of 34.2% (26.4% to 
42.6%, P<0.001, see fig 3A). Adjusting for covariates, 
each additional week of opioid use was associated 
with a 19.9% increase in hazard (95% confidence 
interval 18.5% to 21.4%, P<0.001). For both refills 
and duration, the risk of misuse initially follows the 
trend line and begins to taper at higher levels of use 
greater than 11 weeks (fig 3A).
Compared with duration of use, the dosage 
prescribed was a weaker predictor of misuse (fig 3C), 
e   /(1 + e   ) where   i = -2.5 + di + log(5) x mi ,
di is the duration of exposure for patient i
and mi is an indicator of misuse

and dose became important only with extended use 
(fig 3E). Each additional 10 MME/day was associated 
with only a 0.8% increase in hazard of misuse 
(adjusted hazard ratio 1.008, 95% confidence interval 
1.003 to 1.013, P=0.001). Even high doses (>150 
MME/day) were associated with only mild increases 
in risk when duration was short (fig 3E). For example, 
when the duration of post-discharge prescription was 
less than two weeks, similar rates of misuse were 
found for lower (40-50 MME/day) compared with 
higher (100-150 MME/day) opioid dose. Conversely, 
members receiving greater than nine weeks of opioids 
at a higher dose had dramatically increasing rates of 
misuse: 476 cases per 100 000 person years at <20 
MME/day (n=422) to 2398 cases per 100 000 person 
years at 50-60 MME/day (n=430) to 5689 cases per 
100 000 person years at >150 MME/day (n=237). For 
short term opioid use less than 90 days, higher doses of 
opioids had smaller effects on the rate of misuse than 
did additional weeks of use.
Additional risk factors of misuse
After adjusting for covariates, other risk factors (see 
supplemental eTable 2), including benzodiazepines 
(hazard ratio 1.77, 95% confidence interval 1.64 to 
1.93) as well as regimens initiated with hydromorphone 
(1.76, 1.37 to 2.26) and oxycodone (1.24, 1.03 to 1.48) 
had a statistically significant association with opioid 
misuse. The adjusted effect of surgery was greatly 
attenuated after controlling for the strongly associated 
presurgical diagnoses. Notable presurgical diagnoses 
included bariatric surgery status (V45.86; hazard ratio 
2.19, 95% confidence interval 1.77 to 2.72), tobacco 
use disorder (305.1; 2.16, 1.97 to 2.36), other chronic 
pain (338.29; 2.02, 1.68 to 2.42), and major depressive 
disorder (311; 1.60, 1.44 to 1.78).

Sensitivity analyses
As part of a sensitivity analysis, we constructed models 
that removed potential confounders. We found no 
difference in effect, with similar results for misuse 
events within one year of surgery (see supplemental 
eFigure 3) and among patients with no additional 
surgery during follow-up (see supplemental eFigure 4). 
To ensure that our outcome analysis was not biased by 
a specific ICD-9 code, we removed opioid dependence 
code 304.00, the most common code, leaving only 
specific abuse and overdose codes. The findings 
of the model were virtually unchanged with this 
smaller subset: each additional refill was associated 
with an increased risk of 70.9% versus 70.7% in the 
comprehensive model.
We also verified that the observed association was 
not affected by geography or biased by changing 
conditions across the study period. We compared 
the association between duration and misuse over 
different years (fig 4C) and at the state level; results 
were statistically indistinguishable from a model 
with aggregated duration effect (likelihood ratio test 
P=0.26 and P=0.99, respectively). Figure 4A shows 
that surgeons appear to have reduced the mean dosage 
within their specialty during the study period. Typical 
reductions ranged from 3 to 18 MME/day (4% to 24%) 
over the duration of the study. While opioid dosage 
fell, mean duration of use during the years of the study 
remained relatively stable (fig 4B). Despite changing 
clinician behavior over time, the relation between 
duration of use and misuse was persistent (fig 4C, note 
that only weeks with >100 surgeries are included). 
Such stability is further evidence of the robustness of 
this effect.
Finally, we assessed the potential effect of 
unobserved confounding by generating a synthetic 
binary variable strongly associated with both duration 
of use (odds ratio 2.7) and misuse (odds ratio 5.0, 
see fig 1) and inserted it into the model. An example 
of such a confounder could be an undiagnosed risk 
factor for postsurgical misuse, such as presurgical 
alcohol dependence. Even in the presence of this 
artificial explanatory confounder, which has an 
unrealistically strong relation to misuse, each week of 
use was still associated with a 13% increase in hazard 
of misuse.
discussion
Physicians struggle to appropriately prescribe and dose 
postoperative opioids while tackling the real needs of 
acute pain from surgery.28 29 This study quantifies the 
strong relation between number and duration of refills 
of prescribed opioid drugs and subsequent opioid 
misuse in the surgical population. We focused on typical 
surgical patients without a history of misuse or ongoing 
opioid use and estimated an adjusted 44% increase in 
misuse for every refill fulfilled, or 20% increase for 
every week of prescription. This association remained 
statistically significant in multiple sensitivity analyses 
and using both time until any event and events within 
one year of surgery. Although rates of misuse were low, 
the large number of surgeries performed every year 
increases the importance of these numbers.
Our adjusted models suggest that the effect of 
duration is not explained by temporal changes in 
physician behavior or by patient population. By 
2014, the number of patients receiving opioids and 
the number of patients with prescriptions of short 
durations (<4 days) appears to have been reduced. 
Clinicians increased rates of prescriptions of longer 
durations for a subset of patients (see fig 3B). In the 
face of these changes, overall rates of opioid misuse

have continued to increase (fig 2B), showing that this 
crisis is multifactorial and not only driven by duration 
of use at an aggregate level. But despite a worsening 
trend and temporal changes, we found that the effect 
of duration was stable across study years and was 
unchanged by evolving misuse and prescribing rates 
in the population. The stable relation is suggestive of 
an independent effect (fig 4C).
A second finding was that duration of use rather 
than dosage of equivalent opioids was more strongly 
associated with subsequent misuse of post-discharge 
prescriptions. This builds on previous findings30 31 
showing the importance of prescription duration. 
Each week of opioid use was associated with a 20% 
increase in misuse; short term dosage carried a small 
(about 10%) incremental impact per 100 morphine 
milligram equivalent (MME) on misuse and became 
noteworthy only at longer durations of prescription. 
While this seems discordant with other studies that 
found 2-9-fold increases in rates of misuse for doses

greater than 100 MME/day,5 7 24 31 our work differs from 
these studies—which focused on chronic users—by 
examining a population of general surgical patients 
who typically receive opioids for fewer than two 
weeks. Patients with chronic opioid usage may exhibit 
different risk profiles for misuse.
Comparison with other studies
Our data were consistent with the literature: the rate 
of refills32 and the misuse event rate of 0.2% within 
one year33 was similar to those identified in other 
studies. These numbers build on recent literature 
about the broad effect of post-discharge prescriptions 
on subsequent opioid use. Patients who received even 
one post-discharge prescription were three times more 
likely to be taking opioids at one year.18 This finding 
extended across specialties, where surgical and non-
surgical patients had similar rates of opioid refills. 
Several studies in surgical patients have also shown that 
administering opioids early after surgery is associated 
with subsequent long term usage.31 34 Irrespective of 
the direction of causality, our data suggest that patients 
who require subsequent refills of opioid drugs are 
statistically more likely to have an episode of misuse, 
even years after the index surgery. Whether driven by 
the patient’s underlying need or the clinician’s tendency 
to prescribe opioids, this relation further holds when 
examining refills as individual weeks of use.
Our findings suggest that opioid naive patients who 
receive low to moderately high doses of analgesics for 
short durations have small associated increases in 
overall rates of misuse. Many studies have shown that 
pain is often poorly managed after surgery.35-39 Higher 
doses within standards of moderation may better 
saturate μ receptors, whereas under-treatment of acute 
pain increases the risk of pseudoaddiction, chronic 
pain, and, potentially, overdose.40 41 These findings 
suggest a more nuanced understanding of the relation 
between duration and dosage, with a focus on early 
appropriate treatment of pain (including higher doses) 
for a limited time. Such findings imply that optimal 
postoperative prescribing, which maximizes analgesia 
and minimizes the risk of misuse, may be achieved with 
moderate to high opioid dosages at shorter durations, 
a combination that merits further investigation in 
population based and clinical studies.41

Limitations of this study
We recognize that administrative data have inherent 
biases that may have affected our results. First, the 
dataset does not exclude patients with undocumented 
presurgical misuse or opioid usage. Similarly, 
postoperative misuse might not have been detected 
in members who left the cohort because of lost or 
changed coverage. Miscoded claims are possible but 
less likely as coding of opioid abuse has been found to 
be accurate 85% of the time.42 Alternatively, increased 
recognition of the problem of opioid misuse may 
lead to overcoding in later years or undercoding in 
earlier years. Overcoding could explain the increasing 
rates of misuse observed in later years, but recent 
national studies by other authors have also shown 
similar trends.1 Finally, measurement of opioid use 
is complicated by the possibility that patients might 
fill a prescription and modify the course or dosing 
of the drug.43 We used the cabinet supply method 
for measuring use in an attempt to conservatively 
overestimate usage.
As for the problem of confounding, although we 
controlled for disease burden by adjusting for surgery 
type and examined the full spectrum of presurgical 
diagnosis codes, these are, at best, partial measures of 
disease state at the time of surgery. Notably, we were 
unable to control for the extent of pain or the individual 
features of surgical techniques. In the presence of 
uncontrolled confounding, we cannot be certain of the 
magnitude of the effect we observed. Those patients 
with a higher likelihood of developing misuse might 
request augmented treatment.44 The consistency of 
our findings, despite extensive sensitivity analyses, 
suggests there may yet be a causal component to our 
analysis. This is further supported by evidence linking 
most patients who present to addiction centers to an 
initial prescribed opioid for pain.45
Finally, the generalizability of this study is limited to 
insured adults in the US, as several studies have shown 
increased rates of misuse in Medicaid, Medicare, and 
veteran populations.25 46 47
Conclusions and policy implications
In this study, we quantified the strong association 
between short term postsurgical refills and misuse. 
A single refill increased the potential of misuse by 
more than 40%, and the duration of use appeared 
to be the most prominent predictor of misuse. Our 
findings are important as they offer a potential lever 
for intervention and behavior change after surgery. 
Given that surgical and non-surgical patients receive 
similar numbers of opioid refills, these findings have 
the potential to extend beyond surgery. Surgeons and 
non-surgeons are changing the characteristics of their 
opioid prescriptions, but rates of misuse continue to 
increase. Clinicians are trapped between guidelines 
that recommend shorter duration and lower dosing of 
opioid drugs and a subset of patients who request or 
require opioids beyond the initial prescription. With 
these seemingly conflicting forces at play, our analysis 
provides a broad evidentiary framework to inform 
clinician behavior and promote protocol development. 
Further research of this relation is needed to determine 
how initial treatment regimens can minimize misuse 
and addiction.
