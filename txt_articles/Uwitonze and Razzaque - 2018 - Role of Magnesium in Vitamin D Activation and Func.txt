Nutrients usually act in a coordinated manner in the body. Intestinal absorp-
tion and subsequent metabolism of a particular nutrient, to a certain extent,
is dependent on the availability of other nutrients. Magnesium and vitamin D
are 2 essential nutrients that are necessary for the physiologic functions of
various organs. Magnesium assists in the activation of vitamin D, which
helps regulate calcium and phosphate homeostasis to influence the growth
and maintenance of bones. All of the enzymes that metabolize vitamin D
seem to require magnesium, which acts as a cofactor in the enzymatic reac-
tions in the liver and kidneys. Deficiency in either of these nutrients is
reported to be associated with various disorders, such as skeletal deform-
ities, cardiovascular diseases, and metabolic syndrome. It is therefore essen-
tial to ensure that the recommended amount of magnesium is consumed to
obtain the optimal benefits of vitamin D.

he adequate balance of magnesium and vitamin D is essential for maintaining
the physiologic functions of various organs. Vitamin D helps regulate calcium
and phosphate balance to maintain healthy bone functions.1-6 Skeletal muscles,
heart, teeth, bones, and many other organs require magnesium to sustain their physiologic
functions. Furthermore, magnesium is needed to activate vitamin D. Abnormal levels in
either of these nutrients can lead to serious organ dysfunctions.7-12 Magnesium is the
fourth most abundant mineral in the human body after calcium, potassium, and sodium.
Magnesium activates more than 600 enzymes and influences extracellular calcium
levels.13 It is essential for the stability of cell function, RNA and DNA synthesis, and
cell repair, as well as maintaining the antioxidant status of the cell. It is an important
cofactor for the activation of a wide range of transporters and enzymes.14,15 Also,
magnesium-dependent kinases are responsible for the activation of up to 30% of the func-
tional body proteins. Approximately 40% of total body magnesium content is intracellu-
lar, and almost 60% of magnesium is present in bone and teeth, with less than 1% in
extracellular fluids.15-20 Approximately 0.3% of total body magnesium is found in
serum; therefore, serum magnesium concentration does not reflect the total amount of
body magnesium content and is a poor predictor of intracellular magnesium
content.7,14,20-23 Even when the skeletal or intracellular magnesium content of soft
tissue may be depleted, the circulating levels of magnesium could remain within the
normal range because of its tight homeostatic control24; severely reduced tissue and

 bone magnesium content in the setting of normal serum
magnesium levels has been termed chronic latent
magnesium deficit.24
Vitamin D is a lipid-soluble vitamin with a steroidal
structure that exerts numerous essential cellular and
molecular functions. Other than bone mineralization,
vitamin D is also involved in cellular differentiation
and regeneration of various organs; it is claimed to
influence glucose homeostasis and actively contribute
to maintaining the physiologic functions of the muscu-
loskeletal system. Adequate intake of vitamin D has
shown to diminish the risk of some of the skeletal as
well as nonskeletal disorders.25-32 Vitamin D needs to
be converted from its storage or inactive form (25[OH]
D) to an active form (1,25[OH]2D) before exerting its
biological functions. These various stages of vitamin
D conversions are actively dependent on the bioavail-
ability of magnesium.33,34 Vitamin D is mostly synthe-
sized from 7-dehydrocholesterol upon skin exposure to
sunlight (>80%) and may also be obtained from dietary
sources or supplements as either vitamin D2 or D3.
Research has claimed that its dysregulation can lead to
the development of numerous diseases, affecting the
cardiovascular system, musculoskeletal system, and
nervous system.35-39 Optimal health benefits of exogen-
ous and endogenous vitamin D might not be achieved
without the adequate presence of magnesium, as the
bioactivity of vitamin D is a magnesium-dependent
process.33,34 The purpose of this review article is to
present the biological significance of magnesium in
vitamin D metabolism and its therapeutic importance
to minimize complications related to vitamin D
deficiency.
Physiologic Regulation of Magnesium
Body storage of nutrients are partially dependent on the
balance
between
daily
intake
and
renal
loss.
Approximately 30% to 70% of dietary magnesium is
absorbed by the healthy intestine; the absorption rate
increases with negative magnesium balance and with
the high acidic microenvironment.
Magnesium homeostasis in the body is regulated by
a delicate interplay among intestinal absorption, skel-
etal resorption, and renal reabsorption.7,40,41 Intestinal
magnesium absorption is attained by a passive para-
cellular and an active transcellular uptake; in the small
intestine, magnesium absorption partly occurs by an
electrochemical gradient and by the solvent drag. A
small fraction of magnesium is transported via the spe-
cific ion channels, the transient receptor potential mela-
statin
(TRPM)
subfamily,
mainly
TRPM6
and
TRPM7.23,40 These ion channels are assumed to be dis-
tinctive transporters for magnesium, which possess a
channel and a kinase domain, and are believed to
actively regulate magnesium homeostasis at the cellular
level.40,41 Renal regulation of magnesium is partially
achieved
by
reabsorption
and
urinary
excretion
(Figure 1)23,40,42,43; almost 60% of filtered magnesium
is reabsorbed in the cortical thick ascending limb, and
nearly 5% to 10% is reabsorbed in the distal convoluted
tubule.44 The passive paracellular reuptake of magne-
sium in the thick ascending limb is impaired by the
mutations in claudin-16/paracellin-1, as noted in famil-
ial hypomagnesemia with hypercalciuria and nephro-
calcinosis.23,45 The active transcellular transport of
magnesium in the distal convoluted tubule is similarly
affected by the defects in TRPM6, causing hypomagnes-
emia with secondary hypocalcemia.46 This channel con-
trols the apical entry of magnesium into the tubular
epithelium and changes total-body magnesium homeo-
stasis by altering urinary excretion. The transcriptional

 activity of TRPM6 is regulated by acid-base status,
17β-estradiol, and certain immunosuppressive drugs
(eg, FK506 and cyclosporine).23 Slc41a3, which is
expressed in the distal convoluted tubule and the intes-
tine, has been shown to be actively involved in systemic
regulation of magnesium homeostasis.47 Genetically
ablating Slc41a3 from mice has been found to induce
hypomagnesemia, suggesting a role in its metabolism.
Sources of Magnesium and
Vitamin D
Magnesium is naturally found in many foods, is avail-
able as a dietary supplement, and is present in such
medicines as antacids and laxatives. The magnesium
consumption from natural foods has decreased in the
past few decades, owing to industrialized agriculture
and changes in dietary habits. The standard diet in
the United States contains about 50% of the recom-
mended daily allowance (RDA) for magnesium, and
as much as three-quarters of the total population is
estimated to be consuming a magnesium-deficient
diet.23,48 The recommended daily allowance (RDA) of
magnesium for adults is 310 to 420 mg/d (Table).49
However, the required amount increases during preg-
nancy. It is estimated that more than 50% of women of
a reproductive age do not consume the RDA for
magnesium.50,51
Also, regular strenuous exercise can induce magne-
sium loss through urine and sweat.14 According to the
2005-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES) data, the consumption of magne-
sium was below the estimated average requirement in
diets of 48% of people in the United States.50,52,53
Foods high in magnesium include almonds, bananas,
beans, broccoli, brown rice, cashews, egg yolk, fish
oil, flaxseed, green vegetables, milk, mushrooms, other
nuts, oatmeal, pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds, soybeans,
sunflower seeds, sweet corn, tofu, and whole grains.
However, it is estimated that the magnesium content in
various food and vegetables is declining, ranging from
25% to 80% compared with the levels before 1950.54
It may be possible that errors or differences in measure-
ment systems due to technological advancement might
show such changes in magnesium content. However,
other reasons for reduced magnesium content are
related to the removal of magnesium during food pro-
cessing, as well as changes in soil conditions. For
instance, refined oils, grains, and sugar lose most of
their magnesium during processing. Also, increased
use of pesticides and fertilizers change soil qualities,
which reduce the content of magnesium and other
minerals while growing crops and vegetables.
Moreover, changes in dietary habits from whole food
without preservatives to processed fast food has also
added to the reduced magnesium intake. In the Women’s
Health Initiative Observational Study of 73,684 postme-
nopausal women, the baseline hip bone mineral density
was 3% higher (and the whole-body bone mineral
density was 2% higher) in women who consumed more
than 422 mg/d of magnesium compared with women
who consumed less than 206 mg/d.55 However, the inci-
dence and relative risk of hip and total fractures did not
differ across quintiles of magnesium intake.55 The
2011-2012 US Department of Agriculture survey
reported that the average magnesium intake for men in
the United States was found to be below the RDA.56

 Although the mean magnesium intake had increased from
1977 to 2011 by approximately 15% to 357 mg/d for
men,56 it was still less than the RDA of 420 mg/d.
In a comparative study of the UK government’s
Composition of Food Tables, a steady decline in mag-
nesium content was noted in commonly consumed
food. For instance, between 1940 and 1991, the
decline in magnesium was approximately 24% in vege-
tables, 17% in fruits, 15% in meats, and 26% in
cheeses.57 Water is also a useful source of magnesium,
with some hard tap water containing more magnesium
than soft water.58 Magnesium status is low in popula-
tions who consume processed foods that are high in
refined grains, fat, phosphate, and sugar.57
Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) is produced in the skin
when exposed to sunlight. Vitamin D is therefore not
a real vitamin. People with optimal sunlight exposure
do not need to consume dietary supplementation.
Because standard diets usually do not contain enough
vitamin D, safe sunlight exposure or consumption of
foodstuffs artificially supplemented with vitamin D are
necessary to avert complications related to vitamin D
deficiency.30,32,59,60 Vitamin D, either D3 (animal
source) or D2 (nonanimal source), does not have sig-
nificant biological activity. Rather, it needs to be pro-
cessed further in the liver and kidneys to generate the
biologically active form 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D
(1,25[OH]2D). This activation process occurs in 2
steps: (1) within the liver, cholecalciferol is hydroxy-
lated to 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25[OH]2D) by the
enzyme 25-hydroxylase; and (2) within the kidneys,
25-hydroxycholecalciferol is converted to 1,25(OH)2D
by the enzyme 1α hydroxylase.1,2,32,38,61 The enzym-
atic activity of both hepatic 25-hydroxylase and renal
1α-hydroxylase is a magnesium-dependent process.
Vitamin D is transported in blood bound to the carrier
proteins, and the major carrier is vitamin D–binding
protein. Importantly, the activity of vitamin D–binding
protein
is
also
a
magnesium-dependent
process
(Figure 2).62,63
The high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency is a
pressing global health concern, as hypovitaminosis D is
claimed to be an independent risk factor for overall mor-
tality.53,64 Nutrient deficiencies could be cumulative
effects of dietary inadequacy, reduced absorption, or
excessive excretion. Vitamin D deficiency (<12 ng/mL)
can appear when regular consumption is lower than the
recommended levels for a prolonged period, contact to
sunlight is minimal, the kidneys are not able to generate
the active form of vitamin D, or intestinal absorption of
vitamin D is impaired. Vitamin D insufficiency (12-20
ng/mL) is attributed to low sunlight exposure, the
source of UVB, which is required to induce vitamin D
synthesis in the skin. In addition, seasonal variations,
weather conditions, latitude, and clothing can influence
plasma levels of 25(OH)D28,65-67; race, skin pigmenta-
tion, and age can also influence vitamin D levels.30,68,69

 intestinal magnesium absorption.14 The effects of
vitamin D supplementation on circulating levels of mag-
nesium were investigated in patients with type 2 dia-
betes mellitus.31 In 126 adult patients with controlled
diabetes (55 men and 71 women; mean [SD] age, 53.6
[10.7] years), a significant increase in serum levels of
magnesium was found after they consumed vitamin D3
supplements (2000 IU/d) for 6 months.31 Conversely,
magnesium
acts
as
a cofactor
for
the
vitamin
D–binding protein. Moreover, as mentioned, the metab-
olism of vitamin D by hepatic 25-hydroxylation
and renal 1α-hydroxylation into the active form of
1,25(OH)2D
is
a
magnesium-dependent
process.
Magnesium deficiency results in reduced levels of 1,25
(OH)2D and impaired parathyroid hormone (PTH)
response, and it has been implicated in magnesium-
dependent vitamin D–resistant rickets.14,70,71 Magnesium
supplementation was shown to markedly reduce the
resistance to vitamin D treatment.14,70,71 Magnesium is
the second most abundant intracellular cation and plays
a key role in bone mineralization by influencing the syn-
thesis of the active vitamin D metabolites.33,34 Studies
have shown that hypovitaminosis D–associated risk of
mortality could be modified by the consumption of
magnesium.14,70-72 The effectiveness and clinical ben-
efits of vitamin D are significantly reduced when mag-
nesium homeostasis in the body is not maintained.
Vitamin D also plays a key role in the intestinal
absorption of phosphate and magnesium to influence
eventual skeletal mineralization process.1,2,39 Earlier
studies have shown that the activities of 3 major
vitamin
D–converting
enzymes
and
vitamin
D–binding proteins are magnesium dependent; those
3 enzymes are 25-hydroxylase in the liver and 1α-
hydroxylase and 24-hydroxylase in the kidneys.33,34
Magnesium supplementation markedly reversed the
resistance to vitamin D treatment in patients with
rickets.14,70,71 According to the NHANES data, a
high consumption of magnesium reduced the risks of
vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency in the general
population.53 Also, magnesium plays a significant
role in the immunoregulation of the body. It is critical
to immunocompetence and in natural and adaptive
immunity, partly by influencing the activity of
vitamin D metabolites.22,73
Furthermore, the potential associations of serum 25
(OH)D with mortality, particularly due to cardiovascu-
lar diseases and colorectal cancer, were found to be
modified by magnesium ingestion, and the inverse
associations were primarily found among individuals
whose magnesium intake was above the median.

 Magnesium is vital for maintaining a healthy heart; it
helps stabilize the rhythm of the heart and plays a role
in preventing abnormal blood clotting in the heart.
Magnesium also helps maintain healthy blood pressure
levels.23,74,75 Studies have found that magnesium is
highly effective in reducing the rate of heart attacks
and strokes.14,76,77 A positive association has been
found between dietary magnesium intake and bone
mineral density.55,78-81 Although most osteoporosis
treatment and prevention research has been centered
around increased calcium and vitamin D intake, a
study82 has shown that persons who consumed the
highest amount of magnesium (420 mg for males and
320 mg for females) had higher bone density and
lower risk of osteoporosis (Figure 3). In a study con-
ducted on a small number of osteoporotic postmeno-
pausal women, biochemical features of suppressed
bone turnover were seen in women who consumed
oral magnesium citrate for 30 days.82 Compared with
baseline, serum osteocalcin levels decreased by 5% in
the women who did not receive magnesium supple-
ments (control), and serum osteocalcin levels increased
by approximately 44% in women who received oral
magnesium supplements. Urine deoxypyridinoline
levels decreased by about 41% in the magnesium-
supplemented group and by 5% in the control group
(without supplements). Serum PTH levels decreased
by 32% in the magnesium-supplemented group com-
pared with 4% in the control group.82
Consuming the RDA of magnesium may be more
effective in preventing bone thinning than vitamin D,
as magnesium potentiates vitamin D activities, possibly
by increasing its absorption and endogenous activa-
tion.55,78-80 In bone, magnesium binds at the surface of
the hydroxyapatite crystals to determine its size.83
Crystals in magnesium-deficient bones are bigger,
and they may form brittle bones that are prone to
fractures.84 In addition to skeletal mineralization,
magnesium also helps in osteoblast proliferation,
and
its
deficiency
impairs
bone
formation.85
Magnesium-deficient rats have decreased bone mass
related to reduced numbers of osteoblasts.86,87
Magnesium has been found to be a contributing
factor in patients with established osteoporosis with
vitamin D deficiency and blunted PTH level.88 Studies
have suggested that magnesium could influence PTH
synthesis and determine the number of vitamin D
receptors; therefore, a deficiency in magnesium levels
may lead to diminished synthesis and secretion of
PTH and a reduced number of available vitamin D
receptors in the target cells.42 One study53 claimed that
a significant increase in serum 25(OH)D was achieved
only when vitamin D supplementation was given with
magnesium; another study89 concurred, finding no
increase in serum 25(OH)D level either with vitamin
D or magnesium supplementation alone. A study in
mice showed that magnesium deficiency during preg-
nancy influences both maternal and fetal fatty acid
metabolism and adversely affects fetal growth and sur-
vival, emphasizing the importance of adequate mater-
nal magnesium status for better pregnancy outcome.90
Future Research
Magnesium is an essential cofactor for vitamin D syn-
thesis, and activated vitamin D, in turn, can increase
intestinal absorption of magnesium and, therefore, can
form a feed-forward loop to maintain its homeostasis.
With regard to the musculoskeletal system, future
study may explore the synergistic effect of vitamin D
and magnesium levels along with osteopathic manipu-
lative treatment on performance. The roles and regula-
tion of magnesium in health and diseases are a rapidly
evolving area. Studies have shown that magnesium sup-
plementation can increase the effectiveness of vitamin
D activity; therefore, further controlled studies should
determine the dose of magnesium required for a par-
ticular clinical situation for reducing vitamin D–asso-
ciated disorders.
Conclusion
Magnesium homeostasis is maintained by the delicate
interactions of the intestine, bone, and kidneys.

 Magnesium is an essential cofactor for vitamin D syn-
thesis and activation and, in turn, can increase intestinal
absorption of magnesium and establish a feed-forward
loop to maintain its homeostasis. Dysregulation in
either of these nutrients can be associated with various
disorders, including skeletal deformities, cardiovascular
disorders, and metabolic syndrome.91 A core principle
of osteopathic medicine lies in promoting the body’s
innate ability to heal itself. A better understanding of
how magnesium supplementation might reduce compli-
cations related to vitamin D deficiency would help
improve patient care.
