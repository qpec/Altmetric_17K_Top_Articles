Aim: Hamstring muscle injury is the main injury related to sports requiring sprint
acceleration. In addition, hamstring muscles have been reported to play a role in
horizontal force production during sprint acceleration performance. The aim of the
present study was to analyze (i) the determinants of horizontal force production and
(ii) the role of hip extensors, and hamstring muscles in particular, for horizontal force
production during repeated sprint-induced fatigue conditions.
Method: In this experimental laboratory setting study including 14 sprint-trained male
athletes, we analyzed (i) the changes in sprint mechanics, peak torque of the knee and
hip extensors and flexors, muscle activity of the vastus lateralis, rectus femoris, biceps
femoris, and gluteus, and sagittal plane lower limb motion, before and after twelve 6-
s sprints separated by 44 s rest on an instrumented motorized treadmill, and (ii) the
determinants of horizontal force production (FH) during the sprint acceleration in a fatigue
state (after 12 sprints).
Results: The repeated-sprint protocol induced a decrease in maximal power output
(Pmax) [−17.5 ± 8.9%; effect size (ES): 1.57, large] and in the contact-averaged
horizontal force component (FH) (−8.6 ± 8.4%; ES: 0.86, moderate) but not meaningful
changes in the contact-averaged resultant (total) force (FTot) (−3.4 ± 2.9%; ES: 0.55,
small) and vertical force component (FV) (−3.1 ± 3.2%; ES: 0.49, small). A decrease was
found in concentric peak torque of the knee flexors and extensors and in gluteus and

vastus lateralis muscle activity during entire swing and end-of-swing phase. An increase
was found in contact time and swing time, while step frequency and knee speed before
ground contact decreased. Muscular determinants associated with FH and its decrease
after the repeated-sprint protocol were concentric peak torque of the hip extensors
(p = 0.033) and a decrease in gluteus maximus activity at the end-of-swing (p = 0.007),
respectively.
Conclusion: Sprint-induced fatigue lead to changes in horizontal force production
muscular determinants: hamstring muscle seems not to have the same role than
in non-fatigue condition. Horizontal force production seems to be more dependent
on the hip extensors and gluteus maximus function. Given the fatigue-induced
decrease in hamstring muscle strength, we can hypothesize that muscle compensatory
and kinematic strategies reported in a fatigued state could be an adaptation to
allow/maintain performance and a protective adaptation to limit hamstring muscles
constraints.

INTRODUCTION
Hamstring muscle injury (HMI) is, despite improvements in
knowledge and prevention strategies, the main injury related to
sport requiring sprint acceleration, such as football (Woods et al.,
2004; Ekstrand et al., 2011, 2016), rugby (Brooks et al., 2006), and
athletics (Opar et al., 2014; Edouard et al., 2016). HMI leads to
considerable consequences for athletes, such as time-loss from
sport and high risk of recurrence (Woods et al., 2004; Ekstrand
et al., 2011, 2016; Malliaropoulos et al., 2011; Edouard et al.,
2016). This makes HMI a challenge for all stakeholders around
the athletes to better understand and prevent them.
The majority of HMIs occur during sprinting actions, for
example for sprinters at or near top speed (Stanton and Purdam,
1989; Askling et al., 2007), or in football winning ball possession,
passing a defending player or gaining position to score a goal
(Arnason et al., 1996; Woods et al., 2004; Opar et al., 2015). There
is a clear link between sprinting activity and HMI occurrence
(Stanton and Purdam, 1989; Schache et al., 2012). From this
basic standpoint, we suggest that better understanding sprint
performance and mechanics is a key parameter to improve HMI
prevention.

to be a stronger determinant of field sprint performance than
the overall magnitude of vertical or resultant GRF (Morin
et al., 2011a, 2012; Rabita et al., 2015). Hip extensor muscles
(gluteus maximus and hamstring muscles) play a key role in
this horizontal force production (Dorn et al., 2012; Hamner
and Delp, 2013; Morin et al., 2015), and their neuromuscular
behavior (strength and EMG) has been linked to an increased
risk of sustaining HMI (Croisier et al., 2008; Sugiura et al., 2008;
Yeung et al., 2009; Opar et al., 2015; Schuermans et al., 2017).
Concretely, a greater amount of horizontal GRF (as averaged over
an entire sprint acceleration) was found in subjects who were
both able to highly activate their hamstring muscles just before
ground contact and had the greatest capacity to produce eccentric
knee flexor peak torque (PT) (Morin et al., 2015). In addition to
contributing to a net transfer of power from proximal to distal
joints, it has been suggested that the bi-articular posterior thigh
muscles such as the hamstring muscles have a major influence on
controlling the direction of external forces and propel the center
of mass in the horizontal/forward direction (Jacobs and van
Ingen Schenau, 1992; Jacobs et al., 1996). In addition, in terms
of hamstring demands in locomotor tasks, sprinting seems to
place the largest demands on this muscle group (van den Tillaar
et al., 2017). Coherently, it has been reported that football players
returning to play after rehabilitation from an HMI can display
a decrease in horizontal force production (Mendiguchia et al.,
2014, 2016). Interestingly, gluteus maximus activity and peak
concentric hip extension torque were also significantly related to
the horizontal force production averaged over the initial steps of
the acceleration phase (Morin et al., 2015). Thus, from this basic
standpoint, it seems logical to expect hip extensors and knee
flexors to play a key role in sprinting both from performance and
injury prevention perspectives.
In addition to the mechanical and muscular determinants of
HMI occurrence in sprinting, another parameter comes into the
equation: fatigue. Indeed, injuries do not only occur during the

Sprint Mechanics in Fatigue Conditions
initial sprints. Since team sports matches are associated with
muscular fatigue (Silva et al., 2017), and since HMI occurrence
significantly increases at the end of each half of football or rugby
matches (Woods et al., 2004; Brooks et al., 2006), it is reasonable
to assume that HMI risk increases with hamstring muscle fatigue.
Mair et al. (1996), in an animal laboratory study, reported that
fatigued muscles absorbed less energy before failure compared
to unfatigued muscles, suggesting that fatigued muscles may
be at higher risk of injury. Therefore, in a HMI prevention
perspective, it seems imperative to investigate the influence of
fatigue, since it represents what a broad population of athletes
experience in practical conditions and is one of the acknowledged
HMI risk factors (Opar et al., 2012; Buckthorpe et al., 2018).
There is a clear interest to better understand (i) how fatigue
influences hamstring muscle function during sprint acceleration,
and (ii) what is the role of the hamstring muscles for horizontal
force production in fatigue conditions. This could help to better
understand and prevent this injury risk associated with sports
practice (Buckthorpe et al., 2018; Lord et al., 2018).
In match-induced fatigue conditions (Andersson et al., 2008)
or after a simulated match (Rahnama et al., 2003; Greig, 2008;
Small et al., 2009, 2010) or after RS (Pinniger et al., 2000; Timmins
et al., 2014), changes in sprint kinematics and a decrease in
hamstring strength have been reported. These changes could
cause higher HMI risk due to: (i) changes in sprint kinematics
leading to higher constraints on the hamstring muscles during
fatigue (Small et al., 2009; Røksund et al., 2017), and (ii) fatigue-
induced decrease in hamstring strength leading to increased HMI
risk, as hamstring weakness is an acknowledged modifiable HMI
risk factor (Croisier et al., 2008; Yeung et al., 2009; van Dyk
et al., 2016). In addition, Morin et al. (2011b) reported that a
repeated sprint protocol on an instrumented treadmill induced
both a significant decrease in the capability to produce total force
(FTot) and an even larger relative decrease in horizontal force
component (FH). However, it is unknown whether this decrease
in FH is explained by the decrease in hamstring strength or other
mechanisms. To our knowledge, experimental studies exploring
the influence of fatigue (Rahnama et al., 2003; Greig, 2008; Small
et al., 2009, 2010; Morin et al., 2011b) (i) did not report direct
relationships between fatigue and HMIs, and (ii) did not analyze
the muscular determinants and the role played by hamstring
muscles for horizontal force production in fatigue conditions.
Furthermore, since muscle fatigue is task-specific (Enoka and
Duchateau, 2008), it is of interest to analyze hamstring muscles
function in sprint-specific fatigue conditions. In addition, in
terms of hamstring demands in locomotor tasks, sprinting seems
to place the largest demands on this muscle group (van den
Tillaar et al., 2017). Thus, a repeated-sprint protocol seems to
be a relevant design to analyze both the influence of fatigue
on hamstring muscle function during sprint acceleration, and
the muscular determinants of horizontal force production in
such fatigue conditions. Pinniger et al. (2000) reported that a
general hamstring fatigue task (i.e., 10 maximal 40-m sprints
separated by 30-s recovery) in addition to a specific hamstring
fatigue task on an isokinetic dynamometer lead to a decrease in
hamstring PT, as well as changes in sprint kinematics and muscle
activity. They interpreted these results as potential evidence
for a “
protective”mechanism to compensate for the decreased
force generation capacity of the fatigued muscles (Pinniger
et al., 2000). However, sprint mechanics have not been recorded
concomitantly. To our knowledge, no study has presented a
global approach recording sprint mechanics, muscle strength
and activity after repeated sprint, thus inducing sprint-specific
fatigue and a potentially a better scientific understanding of
sprint acceleration performance, mechanical determinants, and
hamstring muscle function in this context.
Thus, the aim of the present study was to analyze (i)
the determinants of the sprint acceleration performance and
horizontal force production and (ii) the role of hip extensors,
and hamstring muscles in particular, for the horizontal force
production, in repeated sprint-induced fatigue conditions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design
This was an experimental laboratory setting, cross-sectional
study analysing sprint mechanics, isokinetic PT of knee and
hip extensors and flexors, muscle activity and sagittal plane
lower limb motion, before and after twelve 6-s sprints on an
instrumented motorized treadmill. The study was approved
by the institutional ethics review board of the Faculty of
Sport Sciences, and conducted according to the Declaration of
Helsinki II.
Participants
Fourteen male subjects (body mass (mean ± SD): 79.9 ± 7.9 kg;
height 1.79 ± 0.07 m; age 24.2 ± 4.6 years) trained for
sprint running (seven football and basketball competitive level
players, four under-23 high-level rugby union players, and three
regional to national-level track and field athletes) volunteered to
participate in this study. All subjects trained at least three times
a week since more than 3 years, and were free of musculoskeletal
pain or injuries at the time of the study and in the six previous
months. Written informed consent was obtained from the
subjects.
Experimental Protocol and Repeated
Sprints Protocol
A familiarization session for treadmill sprints and isokinetic tests
was performed approximately 1 week prior to the testing session.
After a standardized warm-up described below, subjects repeated
short (<5 s) treadmill sprints at increasing intensities, with full
recovery and until being comfortable with the running technique
required (∼6 trials). Following this, the subjects performed a
familiarization session with the isokinetic test procedure for the
knee flexors (KFlex) and extensors (KExt) and hip flexors (HFlex)
and extensors (HExt), following the isokinetic testing procedure
described below, during which they were encouraged to perform
at their best.
For the testing session, the standardized warm-up consisted
of 5 min of 10 km.h−1 running, followed by 5 min of sprint-
specific hamstring warm-up exercises, and three progressive 6-s

Sprint Mechanics in Fatigue Conditions
sprints at increasing velocities separated by 2 min of passive rest.
Subjects performed the isokinetic warm-up followed by maximal
isokinetic strength measurements of KFlex, KExt, HFlex, and
HExt. Thereupon, EMG electrodes and reflective markers were
placed on the right lower limb. Maximal EMG activity was
measured for each muscle group for standardization. Subjects
repeated the sprint specific warm-up on the treadmill with two
submaximal 6-s sprints. After 5 min of recovery, the subjects
performed one maximal 6-s sprint, from which maximal power
output (Pmax) was used as the criterion score for the first sprint
of the RS performed during the testing session. Indeed, to prevent
pacing effects occurring in such RS protocols (Billaut et al., 2011),
subjects were requested to achieve at least 95% of their respective
criterion score during the first sprint of the RS testing session
(Morin et al., 2011b). Subjects were then allowed ∼3 min of
free cool-down prior to the RS protocol. The RS consisted in
performing twelve 6-s sprints separated by 44-s of passive rest.
Subjects exercised to protocol completion or volitional fatigue,
whichever occurred first. Sprint mechanical data, EMG activity
and video data were recorded during each sprint, and before and
3 min after RS maximal isokinetic strength of KFlex, KExt, HFlex,
and HExt were recorded.
Isokinetic Testing Procedure
Isokinetic
strength
was
measured
using
a
Con-Trex
R
�
isokinetic dynamometer (Con-Trex MJ; CMV AG, Dübendorf,
Switzerland), following the same standardized procedure after
instructions and conducted by the same examiner (PE). PT
of KFlex, KExt, HFlex, and HExt was obtained during three
maximal repetitions at 120◦/s, in concentric and eccentric mode
in a randomized order (Morin et al., 2015). Only the right lower
limb was tested. Gravity corrections were incorporated and
artifacts were controlled (Maffiuletti et al., 2007; Julia et al.,
2010). Subjects were given oral encouragement without visual
feedback. Before maximal measurement and only before RS,
each subject performed two series of six graded submaximal
concentric repetitions at 120◦/s, followed by three submaximal
repetitions at 120◦/s in the concentric and eccentric mode in a
random order, as a specific isokinetic warm-up. This angular
velocity (120◦/s) was chosen because (i) it was previously used
in experimental studies on fatigue-tasks (Rahnama et al., 2003;
Small et al., 2009), (ii) showed a high inter-session reliability
(Maffiuletti et al., 2007), and (iii) we wanted to set only one
velocity to avoid the bias induced by multiple isokinetic series.
A 60-s rest separated each series of movements (Morin et al.,
2015). For KFlex and KExt measurements, each subject was
seated on the dynamometer, with 105◦ of hip flexion, with auto
adhesive straps placed across the chest and pelvis, support to
stabilize the contralateral limb, and with instruction to grip
the seat during maximal measurements (Morin et al., 2015).
The knee rotational axis was aligned with the dynamometer
rotational axis. The dynamometer shin pad was attached 2–
3 cm
proximal to the malleoli. The range of knee motion was fixed
at 90◦ (from full extension to 90◦ of knee flexion) (Morin et al.,
2015). For HFlex and HExt measurements, each subject laid in
the supine position, with the pelvis and chest stabilized by auto
adhesive straps, the hip in the sagittal plane and the knee flexed
at 90◦ (Julia et al., 2010; Morin et al., 2015). The contralateral leg
rested on a support under the foot, with 0◦ of hip extension and
90◦ of knee flexion (Julia et al., 2010; Morin et al., 2015). The
dynamometer rotational axis was aligned with the trochanter
major, and the tested side was attached to the dynamometer via
a thigh strap. The range of hip motion was fixed at 90◦ (from
10◦ of hip extension to 80◦ of flexion) (Morin et al., 2015). PT
normalized to body weight (PTBW, in Nm.kg−1) and agonist-
to-antagonist ratios were used. Reliability of each parameter
was calculated using maximal data from the familiarization and
testing session (Hopkins, 2000; Maffiuletti et al., 2007): reliability
for KFlex and KExt was high [for PT: intraclass correlation
coefficient (ICC): 0.86–
0.95; SEM: 3.8–
8.5%; and CV: 3.0–
5.7%;
for ratios: ICC: 0.69–
0.85; SEM: 6.2–
7.5%; and CV: 5.5–
5.7%];
reliability for HFlex and HExt was moderate (for PTBW: ICC:
0.60–
0.78; SEM: 9.6–
19.4%; and CV: 8.0–
17.3%; for ratios: ICC:
0.20–
0.55, SEM: 10.6–
21.3%; and CV: 7.0–
19.6%).
Sprint Performance Variables
Sprint mechanics were measured during sprints performed on
a motorized instrumented treadmill (ADAL3D-WR, Medical
Development
– HEF
Tecmachine,
Andrézieux-Bouthéon,
France) (for full details, see Morin et al., 2010). Subjects started
in a typical crouched sprint-start position with their preferred
foot forward, attached with a leather weightlifting belt and
thin stiff rope to the wall behind. According to previous studies
(Morin et al., 2010, 2011a, 2012, 2015), sprint kinematics [contact
time (tc in s), aerial time (ta in s), swing time (tswing in s) and SF
(Hz)] and sprint kinetics [contact-averaged horizontal (FH, BW)
and vertical (FV, BW) force component, resultant (total) force
(FTot, BW), maximal velocity (Vmax, m.s−1), and maximal power
output (Pmax, W.kg−1) were calculated using all steps from start
until Vmax].
Muscular Activity
EMG activity of the right vastus lateralis (VL), rectus femoris
(RF), BF and gluteus maximus (Glut) muscles was recorded using
bipolar silver chloride surface electrodes of 30 mm diameter
(Meditrace 100, Tyco healthcare, Mansfield, ON, Canada)
placed on the skin according to recommendations by SENIAM
(Hermens et al., 2000), with low impedance (Z < 5 k�) at the
skin-electrode surface, and with the reference electrode on the
patella. EMG data were recorded with PowerLab system (16/30 –
ML880/P, ADInstruments, Bella Vista, NSW, Australia) with a
sampling frequency of 2,000 Hz. The EMG signal was amplified
with octal bio-amplifier (Octal Bioamp, ML138, ADInstruments)
with a bandwidth frequency ranging from 5 to 1,000 Hz (input
impedance = 200 M�, common mode rejection ratio = 85 dB),
transmitted to the computer and analyzed with LabChart 7.3
software (ADInstruments). Vertical GRF and EMG signals for
the right leg were time synchronized on LabChart 7.3. EMG
activity of each muscle was quantified using the root mean square
(RMS) with a 20-ms moving window, and recorded during the
following phases of the running cycle for the right leg: (i) first
half of the stance phase, (ii) entire stance phase as detected by
a 30-N threshold, (iii) entire swing phase (from foot takeoff

to the subsequent landing of the same foot), and (iv) end-of-
swing phase, defined as the aerial phase (no foot-ground contact)
preceding the stance phase (Figure 1). RMS data for all phases
were normalized to maximal voluntary isometric contractions
(MVIC) data obtained during two 3-s efforts. MVICs were
performed in the sagittal plane to assess hip extension (Glut) and
knee flexion (BF) and extension (VL and RF) for the right hip
and knee with a constant angle. Hip extension was tested with
subjects laying on a table in a prone position, 30◦ hip flexion and
the knee fully extended. Knee extension and flexion were tested
with subjects seated in the frame of a Cybex II (Ronkonkoma,
NY, United States) seat, fastened to the frame at the pelvis and
with knee and hip angles set at 90◦. During these three sets of
two MVICs, two experimenters applied manual resistance at the
subjects’
ankles to ensure a safe maximal isometric exertion.
Sagittal Plane Lower Limb Motion
The motion of the right foot and knee was recorded in the sagittal
plane of motion with a camera (sampling rate of 120 frames per
second, Basler scA640-120gc, Basler AG, Germany) mounted on
a tripod placed 1.5 m away from the treadmill in a lateral view
(for more information, see Morin et al., 2015). Retro-reflective
markers were placed onto the great trochanter, the lateral femoral
epicondyle, and the fifth metatarsal head. Marker trajectories in
the sagittal plane (vertical and horizontal directions) were tracked
and analyzed with Simi Motion 2D software (Simi Reality Motion
Systems GmbH, Unterschleissheim, Germany). The kinematic
variables of interest were: foot and knee speed before contact (in
m.s−1) and foot acceleration before ground contact (in m.s−2).
Data Analysis and Statistics
Descriptive statistics are presented as mean values ± SD. Normal
distribution of the data was checked by the Shapiro–
Wilk
normality test. For all sprint mechanics and EMG variables
considered, “
first sprints”and “
last sprints”values were averaged
for the first two and last two sprints for each subject, respectively
(Morin et al., 2011b). For isokinetic values, we considered
measurements performed before RS as “
pre-RS”and after RS as
“
post-RS.”The significance level was set at P < 0.05. Analyses
were performed using Excel (Office, Microsoft
R
�, 2017) and JASP
(JASP Team software, Version 0.8.5.1, University of Amsterdam,
Netherlands).
In order to estimate the influence of the RS protocol, we
compared first vs. last sprints sprint mechanics and muscle
activity values, pre-RS vs. post-RS muscle PT and ratio values,
using paired samples t-tests and standardized differences in
means for practical significance with ES threshold values of <0.2,
0.2, 0.6, 1.2, 2.0, and 4.0 to represent trivial, small, moderate,
large, very large and extremely large effects, respectively (Hopkins
et al., 2009). Only moderate or higher effects were kept for
interpretation.
In order to analyze the determinants of the horizontal force
production (FH, dependent variable) we used a stepwise multiple
regression model including last sprints and post-RS values
and percentage of difference between the first and last sprints
muscular activity values and between pre- and post-RS muscular
PT and ratio values (delta-RS) as independent variables.
RESULTS
Comparison of Values Before and After
the Repeated-Sprint Protocol
The comparison of first vs. last sprints and pre-RS vs. post-RS
values is presented in Table 1, and for muscle activity according to
the different phases of the step cycle in Figure 1. The RS protocol
induced a large decrease in sprint acceleration performance:
mean decrease in Pmax was −17.5 ± 8.9% (ES: 1.57, large). There
was also a decrease in Vmax (−6.6 ± 6.7%; ES: 0.86, moderate)
and in FH (−8.6 ± 8.4%; ES: 0.86, moderate), but not meaningful
in FTot (−3.4 ± 2.9%; ES: 0.55, small) and in FV (−3.1 ± 3.2%;
ES: 0.49, small). There were moderate to large changes in step
temporal and kinematics variables with the RS protocol: increase
in contact time (11.8 ± 9.8%; ES: 1.30, large) and swing time
(5.2 ± 9.1%; ES: 0.77, moderate), decrease in SF (−6.0 ± 7.7%;
ES: 0.91, moderate), decrease in knee speed before ground contact
(−14.1 ± 11.0%; ES: 1.56, large). For muscular aspects, we
observed a moderate decrease in KFlex (−11.9 ± 13.1%; ES:
0.70, moderate) and KExt (−5.8 ± 8.8%; ES: 0.73, moderate)
concentric PT, and in gluteus maximus muscle activity during

Determinants of Horizontal Force
Production After Repeated Sprints
When explaining last sprints horizontal force production with
stepwise multiple regression model using last sprints and post-
RS values, the muscular determinant associated with FH after
RS (i.e., in a fatigue state) was post-RS HExt concentric
PT (p = 0.033). When explaining the changes in horizontal
force production between first and last sprints with stepwise
multiple regression model using delta-RS values, the muscular
determinant associated with the decrease in FH was the
decrease in gluteus maximus activity at the end-of-swing
(p = 0.007).
DISCUSSION
The main findings of the present study were that (i) the
RS protocol induced a clear decrease in sprint acceleration
performance (Pmax) and in horizontal force production (FH),
which can be considered markers of neuromuscular fatigue, (ii)
higher FH in a fatigue state was mainly associated with a higher
concentric PT of the hip extensors, (iii) the lower decrease in
horizontal force production after fatigue was mainly associated
with a lower decrease in gluteus maximus activity at the end-
of-swing, and (iv) hamstring muscle torque during knee flexion
was not associated with horizontal force production in a fatigue
state, contrary to what was observed in the non-fatigue condition
(Morin et al., 2015).

Determinants of Sprint Acceleration
Performance in Fatigue Conditions
Our results showed a decrease in Pmax in the fatigue condition.
This could be caused by a fatigue-induced decrease (i) in
the total amount of force produce by the athletes onto the
ground (decrease in FTot), or (ii) in the ability to orient the
force in the horizontal direction (represented by FH in the
present study), or (iii) both. Since FH decreased with RS while
FTot was not meaningfully affected, it is very likely that the
decrease in Pmax in the fatigue condition was mainly explained
by the decrease in force output in the horizontal direction
(FH) rather than the total amount of force produced. This
is in agreement with a previous study using repeated sprint-
induced fatigue (Morin et al., 2011b), and with previous findings
in non-fatigue condition reporting that the ability to produce
and apply high levels of FH over the entire sprint acceleration
represents a strong determinant of field sprint performance (e.g.,
Morin et al., 2011a, 2012; Rabita et al., 2015). Thus, whatever
the fatigue state, sprint acceleration requires high amounts of
force applied in the horizontal direction. This reinforces the
interest of a performance-focused perspective to analyze the
muscular determinants of the horizontal force production in
fatigue conditions.
Muscular Determinants of Horizontal
Force Production in Fatigue Conditions
In non-fatigue conditions, hamstring muscles have been reported
to play a key role in horizontal force production (Morin et al.,
2015). In a fatigue state, in this population of athletes, the
main muscular factor associated with FH production was hip
extensor concentric PT assessed by isokinetic dynamometer
within the 3 min after the RS. In addition, the lower decrease
in FH was associated with a lower decrease in gluteus maximus
activity during the end-of-swing. Hamstring muscles do not
seem to have the same association with FH than in non-fatigue
condition. A possible interpretation is that hip extensors (and
mainly gluteus maximus) play a relatively more important role
in horizontal force production in fatigue condition. Hip extensor
function was associated with non-fatigued FH production in
the initial part of the acceleration (first 10 steps) (Morin et al.,
2015). Moreover, Schache et al. (2014) reported that progressing
running speed from jogging to sprinting was mostly dependent
on ankle and hip muscle performance. Everything happens
as if, in fatigued state, the hip extensors maintained their
primary role throughout the acceleration. We hypothesize that
muscles playing a more important role in the second part
of the acceleration (and thus over the entire acceleration) in
non-fatigue condition (i.e., hamstring muscles) (Morin et al.,
2015) do not equally assume this role in an fatigued condition.
Hip extensors (i.e., gluteus maximus) may then compensate the
potentially altered hamstring muscle function in a synergistic
manner.
Further support to this interpretation was the observed
decrease in knee flexor concentric PT in fatigue condition, which
could lead to consequences for muscle action management to
allow FH production. Indeed, due to muscle redundancy various
neuro-motor strategies may exist to compensate for decreased
muscle strength (Goldberg and Neptune, 2007). The muscular
pattern could shift with fatigue to maintain a forward-oriented
force production given the greater decrease in knee flexors
compared hip extensors PT (Table 1). This synergist hypothesis
is consistent with walking studies showing that gluteus maximus
and hamstring muscles compensated for one another (Jonkers
et al., 2003; Komura and Nagano, 2004; Goldberg and Neptune,
2007): when gluteal muscle strength was reduced, positive work

Sprint Mechanics in Fatigue Conditions
from hamstring muscles increased; when hamstring muscles
strength was decreased, the primary compensatory strategy was
an increased work output from gluteus maximus.
In the sprint acceleration context, compensatory strategies
could be an adaptation to maintain performance. It could also
be interpreted as a protective adaptation to limit hamstring
muscles constraints and risk of damage. Indeed, it has been
suggested that a decreased ability of muscle to generate force
is thought to reduce energy absorption efficiency of the muscle
which, in turn, can increase potential for musculotendinous
injuries (Garrett, 1990; Mair et al., 1996). As a result of the
weaker state of the hamstring muscles/knee flexors with fatigue,
the hamstring muscles might be further exposed to injury
risk, especially when high levels of force, velocity and power
production are needed to produce maximal sprint acceleration.
We suggest that muscle compensatory strategies observed
in the present study, with more important role of gluteus
maximus in sprint acceleration, are a possible mechanism to
maintain performance and protect hamstring muscle in fatigue
condition.
In addition, the changes observed in sprint kinematics
could also be associated with hamstring muscles protection.
We reported a decrease in SF, in agreement with Dal Pupo
et al. (2017), as an adaptation of sprint kinematic to the
fatigue. We also reported changes in step temporal variables
and decreased knee speed before the ground contact (Table 1).
These results would be in relation with the reduced maximum
combined hip flexion and knee extension angle reported by
Small et al. (2009) after simulated football match in combination
with the decreased leg angular velocity reported immediately
before foot ground contact after fatigue showed by Pinniger
et al. (2000). Both authors interpreted these findings as a
potential protective mechanism to reduce the rapid lengthening
of the hamstring muscles during fatigued sprint running. In
agreement with this hypothesis, but contrary to our present
results, Dal Pupo et al. (2017) reported an increase of the
leg angular velocity in fatigue conditions, and suggested that
could be due to the hamstring muscles strength decrease
leading to difficulties to decelerate the knee extension, and
exposing the hamstring muscles to higher injury risk in fatigue
conditions. The changes in kinematics variables reported by
Small et al. (2009) and Pinniger et al. (2000) have also
been interpreted as limiting the “
pawing action”of the lower
limb prior to ground contact considered by different authors
(Mann and Sprague, 1980; Wiemann and Tidow, 1995) as
the most likely functional possibility to produce high amounts
of FH.
Explanatory Hypothesis for Hamstring
Injury Risk in Fatigue Condition
Our findings and our hypothesis on compensatory strategies
could help to better understand/explain why a high risk of HMI
has been reported in a fatigue context (Woods et al., 2004;
Brooks et al., 2006). Fatigue-related weakness of the hamstring
muscles should be compensated by hip extensors/gluteus
maximus to allow horizontal force production and protect the
hamstring muscles, as we hypothesized. However, in case the hip
extensors/gluteus maximus muscles strength is impaired, due to
pre-fatigue or fatigue-induced weakness, they cannot perform
these roles. This scenario would place the hamstring muscles in
a high-demand context, possibly higher than they can assume
because of their fatigue state, and consequently expose them to
increased potential damage. This hypothesis is further supported
by the results of previous studies reporting the role of hip
extensors/gluteus maximus as HMI risk factor (Sugiura et al.,
2008; Schuermans et al., 2017). Weaker concentric hip extensors
and eccentric knee flexors PT have been associated with higher
risk of HMI occurrence (Sugiura et al., 2008). Schuermans et al.
(2017) also reported that lower amounts of gluteus maximus
activity during the front swing phase of sprint was associated
with higher risk of HMI occurrence in football players. Time-
dependent muscle activity analysis revealed that players appear to
be relatively protected against HMIs when the proximal muscles
are recruited to a greater extent throughout the swing phase
of sprinting. They suggested that it is very plausible that the
hamstrings might be exposed to higher mechanical loading and
have to engage in higher metabolic output when the supporting
proximal musculature does not function in time (Schuermans
et al., 2017). This is also in agreement with Thelen et al. (2006)
suggesting that the lumbo-pelvic region muscles affect HMI
risk more than that for the distal muscles of the knee and
ankle.
Perspectives for Hamstring Injury
Prevention
Following our hypothesis, we suggest that HMI prevention
strategies should include hamstring muscle strengthening in
both knee flexors and hip extensors function, as well as gluteus
maximus strengthening as hip extensors, in agreement with
Sugiura et al. (2008).
In addition, our present findings support the interest of
analysing fatigue-related aspects when managing athletes in
the context of HMI primary and secondary prevention. This
is in agreement with previous studies analysing hamstring
muscle function in fatigue conditions in athletes with history
of HMI (Røksund et al., 2017; Lord et al., 2018). Lord
et al. (2018) reported a decrease in the knee flexors PT
after fatiguing exercises (isokinetic or RS) on the limb with
previous HMI compared to contralateral healthy limb or control
group. Røksund et al. (2017) reported a significant decrease
in running speed with fatigue in football players reporting
previous HMIs compared to uninjured players. They suggested
that the higher drop in speed during the repeated sprint testing
may be an indication of increased disposition to hamstring
muscle fatigue in players with previous HMI and concluded
about the need for targeted reconditioning programs to ensure
complete post-injury rehabilitation in players recovering from
HMI (Røksund et al., 2017). Therefore, keeping in mind
that HMIs do not only occur during the initial sprint of a
match or a training session (Pinto et al., 2018), we think that
it is relevant to also perform tests/evaluations investigating
hamstring muscle in fatigue conditions. This is in agreement

with Mendiguchia et al. (2017) reporting the interest of global
rehabilitation program after HMI, where single leg bridge test
(Freckleton et al., 2014) for endurance was included as a criterion
to meet before clearance for returning to sports in secondary
prevention. In addition, Van Der Horst et al. (2017) discussed
the interest of evaluating the repeated sprint ability to help
determine the return to sport after HMI. We can also hypothesize
that the reduced ability to continue maintaining performance
when repeating sprints could be an indirect parameter to detect
athletes with higher HMI risk, since such decrease in sprint
acceleration performance in a fatigue state would mean decrease
horizontal force production, as well as hip extensors/gluteus
maximus performance, which could place the hamstring muscles
at risk.
Perspectives for Sprint Training
Our findings support the interest of compensatory muscle
and kinematic strategies to help sprinting performance despite
repetitions leading to fatigue. In a performance perspective, we
can suggest adding an endurance element in strengthening for
lower limb, mainly for posterior chain muscles since they are
involved in sprint acceleration performance. Such an approach
seems relevant since a short-term conditioning program (4
weeks) with either a maximum strength or a muscular endurance
emphasis can equally reduce fatigue-induced loss of strength
over a football match (Matthews et al., 2017). In addition,
we suggest improving sprint technical effectiveness, and also
as specific strengthening exercises for muscles implicated in
sprint mechanics (Morin et al., 2017; van den Tillaar et al.,
2017) during fatigue conditions. All these strategies could
also help in an overall win-win (performance-prevention)
strategy.
Methodological Considerations
The main strengths of the present study were the experimental
design and materials used. The motorized instrumented treadmill
used allowed performing realistic sprint accelerations from
zero to almost maximal velocity in kinetic conditions that
are subjectively and objectively comparable to field linear
sprinting (Morin et al., 2010; Morin and Sè
ve, 2011). It
also allowed measuring sprint kinetics for all the steps, and
synchronizing other analyses such as kinematics and EMG
(Morin et al., 2015). Such an experimental context represents a
great opportunity to improve knowledge on sprint mechanics,
and consequently sprint-related issues such as injury risk
factors. In addition, this specific setup allowed performing a
fatigue protocol using the specific task of sprint accelerations,
while continually recording sprint mechanics and muscular
activity.
Some limitations related to the methodology used have
previously
been
discussed
(Morin
et
al.,

2015).
Other limitations, such as the small number of subjects,
limit the generalization of the findings. However, the small
number of subjects is reflective of an ethical exclusion

The

effects in different level of population including elites. In
this study, we only quantified isokinetic PT value, and
further research might be directed toward the angle at
which PT is attained and also the area under the torque
curve time history (total work). Assessment of HFlex and
HExt has been performed in the supine position, which is

2013; Mendiguchia et al., 2017; Buckthorpe et al., 2018; Oakley
et al., 2018).
CONCLUSION
This study allows better understanding of the determinants of
sprint acceleration performance and horizontal force production
in fatigue conditions and the role of the hamstring muscles in
such conditions, which presents relevant perspectives in practice
given the interest of repeated sprint ability in team sports
and the importance of HMIs in sports including sprinting and
multiple acceleration. The present results show that the muscular
determinants of the horizontal force production change in fatigue
state: the hamstring muscles seem not to have the same role
than in non-fatigue condition. The horizontal force production
seems to be more dependent on the function of the hip
extensors and gluteus maximus. Given the decrease in hamstring
muscle strength with fatigue, we can hypothesize that muscle
compensatory and kinematics strategies reported in fatigue state
could be an adaptation to allow/maintain performance and a
protective adaptation to limit hamstring muscle constraints.
However, in a case of gluteus maximus weakness, this exposes
subjects to HMI risk. Although strong conclusions cannot
be made, these present results should be used in practice
by integrating hip extensors/gluteus maximus strengthening in
addition to hamstring knee flexors strengthening, as well as
endurance-focused training strategies in addition to maximal
performance training, and taking into account the win–
win
performance-prevention strategy: training for performance can
help for injury prevention and vice-versa.
