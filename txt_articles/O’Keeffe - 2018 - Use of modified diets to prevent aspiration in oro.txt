Use of modified diets to prevent aspiration
in oropharyngeal dysphagia: is current
practice justified?
Shaun T. O’Keeffe1,2
Abstract
Background: Although modifying diets, by thickening liquids and modifying the texture of foods, to reduce the
risk of aspiration has become central to the current management of dysphagia, the effectiveness of this
intervention has been questioned. This narrative review examines, and discusses possible reasons for, the apparent
discrepancy between the widespread use of modified diets in current clinical practice and the limited evidence
base regarding the benefits and risks of this approach.
Discussion: There is no good evidence to date that thickening liquids reduces pneumonia in dysphagia and this
intervention may be associated with reduced fluid intake. Texture-modified foods may contribute to undernutrition
in those with dysphagia. Modified diets worsen the quality of life of those with dysphagia, and non-compliance is
common. There is substantial variability in terminology and standards for modified diets, in the recommendations
of individual therapists, and in the consistency of diets prepared by healthcare staff for consumption. Although use
of modified diets might appear to have a rational pathophysiological basis in dysphagia, the relationship between
aspiration and pneumonia is not clear-cut. Clinical experience may be a more important determinant of everyday
practice than research evidence and patient preferences. There are situations in the management of dysphagia
where common sense and the necessity of intervention will clearly outweigh any lack of evidence or when
application of evidence-based principles can enable good decision making despite the absence of robust evidence.
Nevertheless, there is a significant discrepancy between the paucity of the evidence base supporting use of
modified diets and the beliefs and practices of practitioners.
Conclusion: The disconnect between the limited evidence base and the widespread use of modified diets
suggests the need for more careful consideration as to when modified diets might be recommended to patients.
Patients (or their representatives) have a choice whether or not to accept a modified diet and must receive
adequate information, about the potential risks and impact on quality of life as well as the possible benefits, to
make that choice. There is an urgent need for better quality evidence regarding this intervention.

Background
Oropharyngeal dysphagia is common in older people
and in those with neurological and neurodegenerative
diseases [1–6]. Dysphagia increases the risk of aspiration,
or entry of food and fluid into the airways below the true
vocal folds, and of aspiration pneumonia. Use of modi-
fied
diets
to
try
to
prevent
aspiration
and
its
consequences in those with dysphagia has increased dra-
matically in recent decades [3, 7]: thickened fluids are
used in up to a quarter of long-term care residents [8];
and 15–30% of long-term care residents and 30–45% of
older people in acute and rehabilitation wards receive
modified-texture food [9]. Dietary modifications are often
guided by an instrumental assessment, such as a video-
fluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS), during which the
effects of physical manoeuvres and of swallowing liquids
and solids of varying bolus sizes and consistencies on the

 passage of material through the vocal cords into the air-
ways are examined [4].
The clinical effects of modified diets in adults with
dysphagia, or in selected subgroups, have been examined
in multiple high-quality systematic reviews in recent
years [10–24]. These have noted the generally small size
and low quality of studies and the paucity of randomized
controlled trials (RCTs). A systematic search of the lit-
erature since the most recent such review [10], and
using the same search strategy, did not find any relevant
RCT published between May 2016 and May 2018. In the
absence of new RCT evidence, it is arguable that an add-
itional systematic review is unnecessary. Instead, this
narrative review has the following goals:
� To summarise the evidence regarding the potential
benefits and hazards of modified diets in dysphagia;
� To examine whether current practice regarding
modified diets reflects and is supported by the
current evidence base;
� To explore the reasons for any disconnect between
evidence and practice; and
� To provide recommendations and suggestions
regarding the appropriate use of modified diets.
Discussion
Modifying diets to prevent pneumonia
Overall, there is no convincing evidence to suggest that
texture modified foods and thickened fluids benefit
adults with dysphagia by preventing pneumonia and its
consequences [10–28]. There have been few RCTs re-
garding the effects of thickening fluids and none regard-
ing
texture
modified
food.
This
contrasts
with
reasonable evidence suggesting benefits from swallow re-
habilitation [29], including a large single-site RCT show-
ing that a standard programme of early behavioural
swallowing intervention (including active therapeutic ap-
proaches and dietary modification) from speech and lan-
guage therapists (SLTs) in acute stroke patients reduced
the risk of chest infections over six months compared with
‘usual care’ (relative risk reduction 0.56) [30]. (Usual care
in this study involved patient management by the attend-
ing physicians and referral to SLTs or for a VFSS only if
the physician considered it to be appropriate).
The best evidence (based on the GRADE system of
rating quality of evidence [10, 31]) regarding the effects
of thickened liquids in dysphagic patients on prevention
of pneumonia comes from a large multi-centre study
[32, 33]. Initially, Logemann et al. studied 711 patients
with dementia or Parkinson’s disease who aspirated on
thin liquids during a VFSS and who all received three in-
terventions - chin-down posture while taking thin fluids
and nectar-thickened and honey-thickened liquids in a
head-neutral position – in a randomised order during
the VFSS [32]. Half the participants aspirated on all and
25% did not aspirate on any of the interventions; 68% as-
pirated on chin-down, 65% on nectar-thickened and 53%
on honey-thickened liquids (all pair-wise comparisons
significant at p < 0.001 or more). Honey-thickened liq-
uids were significantly less likely to prevent aspiration
when presented last than when presented first in the se-
quence of trials, which may reflect the effects of fatigue.
In a follow-up study, Robbins et al. randomised 504
subjects who had done equally well (all interventions
eliminated aspiration) or poorly (no intervention elimi-
nated aspiration) to continue with one of the three inter-
ventions [33]. The cumulative incidence of pneumonia
after 3 months was 9.8% in the chin-down group, 8.4%
in the nectar-thick group and 15.0% in the honey-thick
group (differences not significant). The median hospital
stay
because
of
pneumonia
was
18
days
in
the
honey-thick
group
compared
with
4
days
for
the
nectar-thick and 6 days for the chin-down groups, which
may reflect an increased aspiration risk and greater diffi-
culty in clearing the airways with more viscous fluids in-
terventions [28, 34, 35]. More patients assigned to
thickened liquids than those assigned to the chin-down
posture developed dehydration (6% vs. 2%, p = 0.05).
Urinary tract infection and fever were also more com-
mon in the thickened liquid groups. Ultimately, the trial
ended early after a futility analysis concluded that enrol-
ling additional participants would not change the results.
The authors concluded that no definitive conclusions
about the superiority of any of the tested interventions
could be made.
Other studies provide indirect evidence regarding the ef-
fects of thickened fluids. In ‘free water protocols’
, selected
patients who aspirate thin fluids are allowed to drink
water, often under supervision and after meticulous oral
hygiene,
in
addition
to
thickened
fluids.
A
recent
meta-analysis of data from inpatient rehabilitation units
concluded that there was low-quality evidence that this
approach did not increase the risk of lung complications
and may increase fluid intake and patient satisfaction [36].
Prospective and retrospective studies of the long-term
outcomes of patients with aspiration or penetration on in-
strumental assessments have not found a significant asso-
ciation between dietary recommendations and occurrence
of pulmonary complications or survival [37, 38].
Potential hazards and disadvantages of modified diets
Poor hydration
Poor hydration is common in frail older people and, in
particular, in nursing home residents where up to a half
of residents in several studies have current or impending
water-loss dehydration (when fluid output exceeds fluid
input leading to raised serum osmolality) [39–41]. Some
reports examining fluid intake have found a reduced
O’Keeffe BMC Geriatrics  (2018) 18:167

 intake in those receiving thickened fluids [42–45].
Vivienti and colleagues found that the greatest contribu-
tion to oral fluid intake in hospital patients with dyspha-
gia was from food rather than beverages; however, even
allowing for this, none of the patients in their study
achieved their calculated fluid requirements unless en-
teral or parenteral fluids were given [44]. An Australian
study noted that only 17% of health care facilities moni-
tored thickened fluid consumption routinely although
most staff recognised the risk of inadequate fluid intake
in those given such fluids [46].
Fewer studies to date have examined the relationship
between modified diets and biochemical indices of dehy-
dration. In a retrospective study of acute stroke patients,
any modification of solid diets or thickened liquids re-
sulted in significantly elevated blood urea nitrogen/cre-
atinine values at discharge compared with those not
having that intervention [47]; these biochemical changes
occurred after an average of only 3–4 days of receiving
modified diets. In another study, 75% of residential care
residents restricted to thickened liquids for oral hydra-
tion had biochemical indices showing dehydration [48].
Poor nutrition
The use of modified-texture foods, particularly pureed
diets, contributes to the high prevalence of malnutrition
in those with dysphagia, especially in long-term care res-
idents [9, 49–52]. A reduction in food intake is common,
and pureed diets are often poorer in calories, protein
and micronutrients than regular diets. In a study of
Canadian nursing homes, pureed menus tended to con-
tain lower amounts of nutrients than regular texture
menus, although there was variability between homes
and in some the pureed menus provided the same or
more nutrition than the regular texture menus [52].
Delayed medication absorption
Even a minimal increase in viscosity can delay medication
dissolution and disintegration and hence bioavailability
and this delay becomes greater with increasing viscosity
[42, 53]. Absorption of Biopharmaceutics Classification
System Class 1 (e.g. prednisolone) and Class 3 (e.g. ateno-
lol, erythromycin and metformin) drugs may be particu-
larly affected if given with thickened liquids [42]. Crushing
and mixing tablets or capsules with thickened fluids delays
dissolution of amlodipine, atenolol, carbamazepine and
warfarin [54]. Although the possible clinical effects of such
alterations in bioavailability aren’t known, they would be
of particular concern for drugs, like carbamazepine and
warfarin, that have a narrow therapeutic index.
Impact on quality of life
Half
to
two
thirds
of
dysphagia
patients
are
non-compliant with recommendations to take a modified
diet; some are completely non-compliant, while others
‘cheat’ or ‘sneak’ proper food and drinks [55–57]. The ob-
vious reason for non-compliance is that patients don’t like
modified diets. Patients have even been noted to include
refusal of thickened fluids in advance directives [32].
A recent systematic review of studies confirmed that
modified diets worsen health-related quality of life signifi-
cantly [58]. Patients using thickened fluids report less sat-
isfaction with the drinks, with their level of thirst and with
mouth cleanliness and use descriptions such as ‘vile’ and
‘awful’ [58, 59]. Some patients may give up preferred
drinks rather than having them in their thickened form
[60]. Food modification may have an even greater impact
on quality of life than thickening of fluids, and consumers
complain about the appearance, taste, and mouth-feel of
pureed food [58, 61–63], and report that eating is reduced
‘to a matter of necessity and hunger’ [63].
Caregiver perceptions
Carers’ beliefs that modified diets are unpalatable also
contribute to non-compliance. In a recent study of staff
perceptions of pureed food, most had a negative view
describing such food with terms like ‘tasteless’ and
‘mush’; positive comments such as ‘tasty’ and ‘aromatic’
mainly
came
from
allied
health
professionals
and
dietary-nutrition staff [64].
Healthcare professionals and non-dysphagic patients
who have sampled them report a strong dislike for thick-
ened fluids, especially those of higher viscosity [65–68].
Gorham-Rowan and Coston reported the experience of
68 speech and language therapy students asked to con-
sume only thickened liquids for 24 h: all but one had a
negative response to the experience; common symptoms
– perhaps related to underhydration - included persist-
ent thirst, craving water, fatigue, headache and difficulty
concentrating [68].
Costs associated with modified diets
In the USA, the total monthly costs for thickened liquids
for a person have been estimated to be in the range of
$174 to $289 [33, 69] In England, prescribing of thick-
eners costs the health service about £14 million per year
[70]. Pre-prepared meals and fluids are often costlier but
this may be offset by savings on staff preparation time
and costs in long-stay units [69]. It has been argued that
‘a modest reduction in pneumonia incidence would (my
emphasis) produce an enormous economic benefit and
increased survival, justifying management of dysphagia’.
[71] However, a reduction in pneumonia remains un-
proven and the costs from treating dehydration and its
consequences [72] and from providing nutritional sup-
plements in those with reduced oral intake due to modi-
fied diets would be equally deserving of consideration in
any economic analysis.

 Modified diets in clinical practice
Usual clinical practice with regard to modified diets is
characterised by a startling inconsistency at all levels: in-
consistencies in national standards and practices; incon-
sistencies in how carers and professionals apply those
standards that do exist; and inconsistencies in the rec-
ommendations and practices of individual therapists.
Lack of standardisation of modified diets
An international convention on terminology and defini-
tions for texture-modified foods and thickened liquids has
recently been agreed [73]. National approaches to describ-
ing thickened fluids include descriptive terms such as – in
increasing
thickness
-
nectar-like,
honey-like
and
pudding-like, and rheological measures. The same vari-
ability is seen in labelling of modified foods [3, 9].
Even experienced SLTs are unable to reliably produce
liquids to desired levels of thickness and have only mod-
erate success in their ability to replicate those levels of
thickness in later attempts [74]. There is considerable
variability in the consistency of thickened fluids prepared
by staff within and between hospitals [75]. It is likely
that the same problems arise with in-house production
of modified texture food [7].
Variability in clinical practice
The use of different modified diets among SLTs vary
greatly [7, 76–78]. Among 145 experienced SLTs, al-
though nearly half prescribed thickened liquids for
one-fourth to three-fourths of their dysphagic patients,
responses ranged from less than 5 % to greater than 90%
[7]. A vignette (including viewing a VFSS) of a dysphagic
stroke patient elicited 47 treatment techniques and more
than 90 treatment combinations from 245 SLTs, includ-
ing different approaches to modifying diet [78]. In one
nursing home study, 91% of patients placed on modified
diets were placed on overly restrictive diets [79]. It has
also been reported that SLTs are not always involved in
training other staff in how to prepare modified diets [7].
While conducting their RCT, Logemann et al. noted
that some patients were receiving thickened fluids al-
though they did not have any aspiration of thin liquids
during the VFSS [32]. A failure to assess the need for, and
to review the acceptability and effectiveness of, modified
diets in residential care settings may result from staff
shortages or inadequate funding of services provided by
SLTs [80]. In an Australian survey of attitudes of different
disciplines to mealtime issues in residential care, some
participants reported that nurses had the skills to assess
swallowing problems and to modify the texture of diets
accordingly; a common response was to place residents
on a puree diet and thickened fluids without specification
of the degree of thickening [80]. Studies of nursing home
residents and their families also suggest ‘a blanket
provision’ of modified diets in some nursing homes [62].
Why is there a disconnect between evidence and practice?
The lack of evidence supporting the use of modified di-
ets to reduce pneumonia is widely acknowledged in the
dysphagia literature, and several writers have expressed
unease at how widely they are used in everyday practice
despite the lack of evidence [26, 81–83]. However, even
among dysphagia experts, acknowledgement that the
evidence base is not strong may be followed may be
followed declarations that modified diets are important
to maintain health [84]. Commentators have suggested a
number of reasons for the discrepancy between evidence
and practice and for continuing to recommend modified
diets in some circumstances (Table 1) [71, 85–89].
Modified diets have a rational pathophysiological basis in
dysphagia
Modifying diets is a rational approach to reducing aspir-
ation, and this, irrespective of any paucity of long-term
evidence, may justify their use [19, 71]. Studies of the ef-
fects of bolus modification on swallow safety show that
thickening liquids slows their flow rate, allowing more
time for airway closure and reduces the risk of aspiration;
modified texture food are easier and safer to swallow for
those with chewing problems [1–4]. The avoidance of as-
piration by modifying bolus consistency in a swallowing
study suggests that modifying everyday dietary consisten-
cies for that person to a similar degree might reduce their
subsequent risk of aspiration pneumonia.
This argument sounds plausible, but it is only a hy-
pothesis; many widely-used interventions in medicine
that should have benefited patients, based on patho-
physiological reasoning, ultimately were shown to have
no benefit, or even to cause harm [90, 91]. There are
also reasons to question whether modifying diets to pre-
vent aspiration pneumonia might represent a consider-
able over-simplification of the issue.
� Aspiration pneumonia is not a direct and inevitable
consequence of aspiration: not all who aspirate
develop pneumonia, and many who develop
pneumonia are not aspirators [92–95]. Dysphagia is
one but not necessarily the strongest risk factor for
aspiration pneumonia [92]. Colonization of the
oropharynx with pathogens and subsequent
aspiration of infected saliva and secretions is
important in the pathogenesis of aspiration
pneumonia [96]. Modifying diets will not influence
the aspiration of saliva and secretions.
� An instrumental swallowing assessment bears little
resemblance to eating in real life and fluids used
during videofluoroscopy do not provide an accurate
O’Keeffe BMC Geriatrics  (2018) 18:167 
Page 4 of 10
 indication of swallowing ability at mealtime [97].
There remain concerns regarding the interrater and
intrarater reliability of instrumental assessments of
swallow even with highly-trained raters [98], and
test-retest reliability of assessments is unknown and
might be affected by factors such as fatigue [35].
� Although the risk of aspiration in instrumental
studies is reduced with liquids with increasing
degrees of thickness, higher viscosity liquids also
result in increased pharyngeal residue after
swallowing with the potential for increased
aspiration risk [28]. The same may be true for some
modified texture foods [25].
Evidence-based decision making is not just about RCTs
Other writers have criticised the over-emphasis on (the
lack of) RCT evidence regarding dysphagia interventions
[71, 86]. Many healthcare interventions lack good RCT
evidence; this doesn’t mean they don’t work nor that
they should not be used [71, 99, 100]. Evidence based
practice has been defined as “the integration of best re-
search evidence with clinical expertise and patient
values” [101]. Good clinical practice is more complex
than trials alone. Even when good evidence exists, it is
not always generalizable to the individual patient, and
clinical expertise will be needed to adapt research find-
ings to the needs and wishes of the individual patient.
These are strong arguments. Practitioners faced with a
patient with troublesome dysphagia must often make
pragmatic recommendations even if based on imperfect
evidence. It is also true, however, that the absence of ro-
bust evidence has a more detrimental effect on decision
making if an intervention, as with modified diets, is in-
trusive and carries significant potential hazards as well
as benefits [102, 103].
Attitudes and knowledge of practitioners
Surveys of practicing SLTs suggest a strong consensus
supporting modified diets based primarily on therapists’
training and experience [7, 8, 87]. Quantitative and quali-
tative surveys of the attitudes and beliefs of practitioners
suggest that clinical experience and pragmatic consider-
ations outweigh research evidence and patient preferences
in determining everyday practice [87–89]. Ignorance of
the lack of evidence may be a factor: one paper commen-
ted on ‘a lack of research-based reasoning’
, [87] and a sur-
vey of 145 SLTs found that 85% agreed and only 5%
disagreed that thickening liquids was effective in dyspha-
gia [7]. Also, even therapists familiar with the lack of evi-
dence may be uncomfortable recommending thin fluids
for someone who is known to aspirate [81].
Modified diets are justified if consent is obtained
As with other healthcare interventions, the person or, if
he or she lacks capacity to decide, their representative
should decide - and accept responsibility for the conse-
quences of that decision - whether to take a modified
diet after receiving adequate information about the risks
Table 1 Non-evidence-based arguments for and against use of modified diets
Argument
Pro
Con
Modifying diets has a
rational
pathophysiological
basis.
Dietary modifications make swallowing easier and
safer in those with dysphagia
The risk of aspiration in instrumental studies is
often reduced by dietary modification.
Similar dietary modifications in everyday life might
reduce aspiration pneumonia.
Many physiologically rational healthcare interventions
have ultimately been shown not to benefit patients.
Aspiration pneumonia is not a direct and inevitable
consequence of aspiration.
Modifying diets will not influence the aspiration of saliva
and secretions.
Instrumental swallowing assessment bears little
resemblance to eating in real life.
Evidence-based decision
making is not just about
clinical trial evidence.
There is sometimes an overemphasis on (the lack of)
trial evidence.
Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.
Decision making requires the integration of the best
evidence available with clinical expertise and patient
values.
The absence of robust evidence is problematic because
modifying diets is intrusive and carries significant possible
hazards as well as benefits.
Many practitioners overestimate the benefits of modified diets.
There is evidence that clinical experience outweighs research
evidence and patient preferences in determining everyday
practice regarding modified diets.
Modified diets are
justified if consent
is obtained.
Patients should make their own decision after receiving
adequate information about the potential benefits
and risks of modified diets.
Strong beliefs that modified diets are beneficial might
influence how practitioners present risks and benefits to
patients.
There are exceptions
to the need for
research evidence
Modified diets may be required if there is an immediate
and significant distress related to feeding or a high risk
of asphyxiation.
Modified diets may be justified if used in conjunction
with an active swallow rehabilitation program.
An individual treatment trial is warranted if there is
reasonable expectation of benefit, the patient agrees,
and there is follow-up to assess the impact of treatment.
Follow-up assessment is not always available, perhaps
especially in residential care settings.
O’Keeffe BMC Geriatrics  (2018) 18:167

 and benefits of their use [32, 104, 105]. This is a persua-
sive argument provided that the ethical requirements of
informed consent - provision of accurate and balanced
information regarding treatment options and their bene-
fits and risks and the voluntariness of choice - are met.
Given the lack of robust evidence, most recommenda-
tions to modify diets should come hedged with ‘maybe’s’
and with acknowledgements of uncertainty rather than
with ‘must’s’. However, the strong belief of some practi-
tioners that modified diets are essential and beneficial
might influence how they educate patients (as well as
catering, nursing and other staff) about modified diets
[78, 87]. Ullrich and Crichton, in a qualitative study of
the attitudes of staff and nursing home residents and
their families regarding texture modified food, commen-
ted on a risk-averse culture of care: ‘Risk management
was …. communicated through language that was puni-
tive—stripped down to imperatives that attended solely
to compliance…’ [63].
Some reports regarding those who are non-compliant
with recommendations to modify diets raise questions about
how voluntarily people give consent. Non-compliance may
cause ‘moral unease or distress’ to staff; some may refuse to
participate in feeding a non-compliant patient; patients who
remains determined to make what is seen as an unduly risky
choice may be threatened with premature discharge [106].
Non-compliant patients may be asked to sign waivers of
liability [106–108], although this approach has been criti-
cized by others [109, 110].
Exceptions to the need for research evidence
Situations do arise in the management of dysphagia
where common sense and the necessity of interven-
tion will clearly outweigh any lack of evidence or
when
application
of
evidence-based
principles
can
enable good decision making despite the absence of
robust RCT evidence.
Immediate and significant distress or danger
It seems obvious that assessment and intervention is
needed if there is immediate and significant distress
related to feeding or a high risk of asphyxiation. (‘Im-
mediate’ and ‘significant’ are highlighted: the distress
that
might
result
from
developing
pneumonia
or
occurrence of non-severe symptoms such as a wet
voice or a clearing cough should not be used as a
justification for widespread intervention). People with
severe aspiration or chewing problems may be fearful
of taking thin liquids and a normal diet [85]. They
may, even without liking the diet, appreciate the
greater control and lower risk of immediate aspiration
from a modified diet.
In conjunction with a swallow rehabilitation program
There is some evidence of benefit from swallow re-
habilitation programs, and intensive swallow therapy
reduces chest infections in dysphagic acute stroke pa-
tients [29, 30]. Patients undergoing swallow rehabilita-
tion may also, if judged appropriate, receive modified
diets. This implies, even without direct evidence, that
similar benefits can be expected in other populations
undergoing active swallow rehabilitation. Also, modi-
fied diets seem likely to be more acceptable to patients
if they are for a limited period under practitioner super-
vision in this context.
Individual treatment trial
Even in the absence of high quality evidence, a ‘carefully
controlled single patient treatment trial’ to evaluate the
effect of an intervention is justified if an intervention is
logical for that patient, there is a reasonable expectation
of benefit and the patient agrees [111]. This seems a rea-
sonable approach when, for example, an instrumental
assessment suggests that someone might benefit from a
particular modified diet. It acknowledges, in particular,
the importance of the patient’s perspective, the need for
any
discussion
regarding
an
intervention
to
be
dependent on the quality of evidence and the import-
ance of follow-up.
Conclusions
There is little good evidence of benefit from modified di-
ets and there is the potential for harm including as ad-
verse impact on quality of life. This does not mean that
use of modified diets should be abandoned. It does sug-
gest the need for careful consideration as to when modi-
fied diets might be recommended to patients and how
discussions about modified diets should be conducted
and informed consent sought.
When should modified diets be considered or
recommended?
It is likely that practitioners will have to continue to
consider the appropriateness of modified diets for pa-
tients with dysphagia without the benefit of RCT evi-
dence for the foreseeable future. (Examination of the
International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (23rd May
2018) shows no registered trial dealing with this topic).
It has been argued persuasively that, even in these
circumstances,
application
of
the
principles
of
evidence-based practice can lead to practitioners and
their patients making reasonable decisions about this
intervention [32, 111]. Individual trials of treatment,
after discussing the possible benefits and risks and their
own
preferences
with
patients,
with
appropriate
follow-up will often be a reasonable option.

 While there are no doubt many settings where such
good practices are followed, some studies raise concerns
about whether everyday practice and attitudes towards
modified diets does reflect an evidence-based approach.
These include studies showing an overreliance of some
practitioners on clinical experience and training to guide
practice and the provision of modified diets, perhaps
particularly in long-stay units, without appropriate as-
sessment, communication, implementation and review.
It is true that some such practices are outside the con-
trol of clinicians [80]; nevertheless, clinicians should not
be complicit in poor practice and should communicate
and document their concerns to their patients and to
the relevant institutions.
Communicating with patients about modified diets
Tone of discussions and strength of recommendations
The tone of the discussions between clinicians and pa-
tients and the strength of recommendations of the
former should be highly dependent on the quality of the
evidence. There should be, in effect, a sliding scale of
how strongly clinicians should recommend modified di-
ets from, for example, urging or pleading with a reluc-
tant
or
non-compliant
patient
to
accept
some
modification of food texture if their risk of an asphyxial
death is high to, at most, a tentative suggestion of a trial
of therapy if there might be sufficient benefit from a
thick fluid consistency to offset the risks of dehydration
and impact on quality of life. Ultimately, the patient
must understand that, irrespective of the view of the
clinician, he or she has a choice.
What level of disclosure is required regarding benefits and
risks
Clinician recommendations and patient decisions are
based on their relative assessments of whether the po-
tential benefits of modified diets (or other interventions)
will outweigh the potential risks (including impaired
quality of life). It is for the patient to decide how he or
she would judge that balance. In order to make that de-
cision the patient needs and is entitled to information,
not only about the potential for reducing aspiration
pneumonia, but about possible risks and hazards, in-
cluding underhydration and nutrition and the impact on
quality of life [112]. Uncertainty, while a potential cause
of stress for patients, is a fair description of current
knowledge of the potential benefits and risks from modi-
fied diets and should be acknowledged and communi-
cated when discussing this intervention. It would be
unacceptable to seek to withhold information about the
possible hazards of modified fluids to try and improve
adherence to clinician recommendations.
Quality of life
Quality of life is as or more important than quantity of
life for many people [103, 113–116]. The fact that modi-
fied diets often worsen quality of life suggests that
non-compliance
is
an
understandable
and
rational
choice for many people [58, 65]. This would still be the
case even if there were evidence that non-compliance re-
sult in adverse effects. One benefit of reviewing patients
who have had a trial of therapy with modified diets is
that they can balance any possible benefits (such as ab-
sence of chest infections), possible risks (such as need
for treatment with parenteral fluids) and their lived ex-
perience with modified diets and make a fresh, and
more-informed, decision whether to continue with a
modified diet.
Need for further research
Modified diets are a more intrusive intervention than
any medication and are widely used in the absence of a
high-quality evidence base. Individual patient trials may
be the best that can be achieved at present but are no
substitute for having RCT evidence to guide practice.
Such trials are even more important if widespread
screening of those who do not present with worrying
symptoms directly suggestive of aspiration problems is
to be recommended [117]. There is also much to learn
about how best to monitor those receiving modified di-
ets, in particular for hydration status. Biochemical test-
ing, perhaps weekly initially and then less frequently,
would seem the most obvious candidate but this requires
further evaluation. ‘More research is needed’ is an
often-derided cliché, but it is, I believe, a justified con-
clusion of many reviews dealing with modified diets in
dysphagia [12–20].
