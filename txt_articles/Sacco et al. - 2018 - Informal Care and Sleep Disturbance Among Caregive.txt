Abstract
Study Objectives: To examine cross-sectionally and prospectively whether informal caregiving is related to sleep 
disturbance among caregivers in paid work.
Methods: Participants (N = 21604) in paid work from the Swedish Longitudinal Occupational Survey of Health. Sleeping 
problems were measured with a validated scale of sleep disturbance (Karolinska Sleep Questionnaire). Random-effects 
modeling was used to examine the cross-sectional association between informal caregiving (self-reports: none, up to 5 
hours per week, over 5 hours per week) and sleep disturbance. Potential sociodemographic and health confounders were 
controlled for and interactions between caregiving and gender included. Longitudinal random-effects modeling of the 
effects of changes in reported informal caregiving upon sleep disturbance and change in sleep disturbance was performed.
Results: In multivariate analyses controlling for sociodemographics, health factors, and work hours, informal caregiving 
was associated cross-sectionally with sleep disturbance in a dose–response relationship (compared with no caregiving, up 
to 5 hours of caregiving: β = 0.03; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.06, and over 5 hours: β = 0.08; 95% CI: 0.02, 0.13), results which varied by 
gender. Cessation of caregiving was associated with reductions in sleep disturbance (β = −0.08; 95% CI: −0.13, −0.04).
Conclusions: This study provides evidence for a causal association of provision of informal care upon self-reported sleep 
disturbance. Even low-intensity care provision was related to sleep disturbance among this sample of carers in paid work. 
The results highlight the importance of addressing sleep disturbance in caregivers.

Statement of Significance
Sleep disturbances are a common health problem. One likely cause of sleep disturbance is provision of informal care 
to an elderly, ill, or disabled person. In this prospective analysis of 21 604 participants in paid work, caregiving was associ-
ated with self-reported sleep disturbance, particularly at higher numbers of hours of informal care. The effects of provid-
ing informal care at different intensities varied between women and men. In analyses of change in caregiving, providing 
caregiving at the first but not the second wave was associated with reduction in sleep disturbance. These findings support 
the hypothesis that provision of informal care affects the carer’s sleep quality. Further large-scale studies to examine the 
mechanisms of sleep disturbance among in-work carers are required.

 Introduction
Sleeping problems are common: in Swedish adults aged 18–84, 
insomnia disorder, that is, insomnia symptoms and daytime 
consequences, has an estimated prevalence of around 10.5% and 
symptoms of insomnia are reported by one-quarter of the popu-
lation [1]. Evidence is growing that people with insomnia symp-
toms have a raised risk of developing physical illness [2], specific-
ally cardiometabolic disease, occupational injuries, and all-cause 
mortality [3, 4]. In terms of mental illness, disturbed sleep and 
tiredness are common symptoms of mood disorders such as 
depression [5]. Consequently, addressing the causes of insomnia 
may contribute to improvements in population health [6].
One likely important cause of sleep disturbance is provision 
of informal care to an elderly, ill, or disabled person. Informal 
care is assistance provided by people from the intimate environ-
ment of the dependent person, who do not receive any training 
or economic compensation. It is common: in the United States, 
16.6% of adults [7] and in Sweden, 10.9% of adults [8] are cur-
rently informal carers, rates that are expected to increase in line 
with population aging and cut-backs in publicly funded care [9]. 
Informal caregiving has been associated, albeit inconsistently, 
with a range of poor health outcomes among carers in large 
cross-sectional and prospective studies [10–13], depending on 
the characteristics of the carer and person cared for, type of 
health outcome, type of care provided, and duration of follow-
up [14, 15]. However, some studies find that caregiving may be 
neutral or benefit carers’ health, e.g., by providing an additional 
rewarding role (role enhancement) and improving the quality of 
family relationships [16–20]. Among other factors, it is prob-
able that the intensity and duration of care provision determine 
whether and to what degree caring has a positive or negative 
impact on the caregiver.
Although it has been argued that various aspects of the caregiv-
ing role impact on sleep specifically [21], recent reviews of the evi-
dence note that few adequately powered, community-based, longi-
tudinal studies have examined the impacts of caregiving on sleep 
[22–24]. Existing studies point to poorer sleep among caregivers, 
but apart from certain exceptions, tend to be cross-sectional, use 
small samples which make effects hard to detect, or only examine 
specific groups of carers without comparing them to the general 
population. Important confounders such as the caregiver’s educa-
tion level or health may not be controlled for, factors which lead to 
both selection into the caregiving role and sleep disturbance [17]. 
Stronger evidence would also be provided by prospective designs 
linking changing provision of care to changes in sleep, but almost 
no research has so far done so [25, 26].
Although recent reviews have argued for greater focus on 
subpopulations of carers in terms of factors such as age [27], 
or care recipient characteristics [28], to the best of our know-
ledge, prior research has not examined the impact of care-
giving on sleep in the important and large population of car-
egivers who are simultaneously engaged in paid work. This is 
despite evidence that difficulties combining work tasks with 
family obligations can generate stress and health problems [29, 
30], Specifically, the demands of paid work may conflict with 
requirements to provide informal care, which may lead to role 
overload, in which an individual with a finite amount of time and 
energy experiences strain from trying to fulfil multiple roles [16].
Consequently, this study focuses on caregivers and non-
caregivers who are in paid work, and uses a large community-
based prospective dataset to examine both the cross-sectional 
and longitudinal associations of caregiving with sleep dis-
turbance. Important health and demographic confounders of 
the caregiving-sleep relationship are controlled for. Firstly, we 
examine whether greater intensity of caring, operationalized 
using weekly hours of care provided, is associated with sleep 
disturbance in cross-sectional analyses. We hypothesize that 
providing informal care will be associated with sleep disturb-
ance, although the benefits of “role enhancement” may mean 
that carers providing low-intensity caregiving experience lower 
levels of sleep disturbance than noncaregivers. Since women 
tend to provide more informal care than men [7], and reports 
of insomnia symptoms are more frequent for women than for 
men [1], gender interactions are included in these analyses in 
case the relationship between caregiving and sleep disturbance 
differs by gender. Secondly, in longitudinal analyses, we exam-
ine the effects of changes in caregiving upon sleep disturbance 
and upon change in sleep disturbance. We hypothesize that 
commencing informal caregiving will be associated with greater 
sleep disturbance and cessation of caregiving with reduced 
sleep disturbance. To the best of our knowledge, only one study 
has previously examined the relationship between starting and 
stopping provision of informal care on sleeping problems, in a 
small sample of spousal Alzheimer caregivers [26]. In short, the 
longitudinal analyses performed in this study may offer add-
itional evidence for a causal relationship between informal care-
giving and sleep disturbance in a large sample of in-work carers.
METHODS
Study Population
Participants in the Swedish Longitudinal Occupational Survey 
of Health (SLOSH) formed the study population. SLOSH is a 
biennial postal survey, which follows a subsample of gainfully 
employed people aged 16–64 from the Swedish Labour Force 
Survey who were recruited into the Swedish Work Environment 
Surveys (SWES) 2003–2011 [31]. Both SLOSH and the present 
study have been approved by the Regional Research Ethics Board 
in Stockholm. All participants provided informed consent.
SLOSH participants respond to one of the two versions of 
the postal questionnaire: an in-work questionnaire for those 
currently in paid work at least 30% of full-time and another for 
those working less or who are outside the labor force whether 
permanently or temporarily. The present study is based on 
information provided in the in-work questionnaires only from 
2010, 2012, 2014, and 2016. Response rates to the SLOSH ques-
tionnaires were 57% in 2010 and 2012, 53% in 2014, and 51% in 
2016. In total, 21604 participants responding to at least one in-
work questionnaire were included in the study, providing 42928 
observations for the analysis. The change analyses required par-
ticipants to respond to the in-work questionnaire in at least two 
consecutive waves, a requirement which reduced the sample to 
12253 people.
Sleep Disturbance
Self-reported sleep disturbance was measured at each wave 
using a validated measure of disturbed sleep composed of four 
questions from the Karolinska Sleep Questionnaire [32–34]. The 
measure contains the core symptoms of insomnia; specifically 
participants were asked how often they had been disturbed in

 the previous 3 months by difficulties falling asleep, repeated 
awakenings with difficulties going back to sleep, premature 
(final) awakening, or disturbed or restless sleep, with response 
options ranging from 0 (“never”) to 5 (“always/five times a 
week”). Item nonresponse rates were low: 1.1% for one missing 
item, 0.2% for each of two and three missing items, and 1.1% 
for four missing items. An average sleep disturbance score was 
calculated for participants who provided responses to at least 
three of the four items. Change in sleep disturbance from one 
wave to the next was calculated by subtracting the score in the 
earlier wave from the score in the next wave.
Provision of Informal Care
At each study wave, questions about participants’ time use in 
a typical work week were used to identify how much care in 
hours participants provided for a relative other than a child or 
grandchild. Original response categories were 0 hour (85.8% of 
sample members), 1–5 hours (12.4%), 6–10 hours (1.2%), 11–15 
hours (0.3%), and >15 hours (0.4%). The last three categories were 
collapsed into >5 hours per week since relatively few respond-
ents provided high numbers of hours of informal care. A dichot-
omized variable of caregiving was used in analyses examining 
change between consecutive waves: no care-giving and provi-
sion of any care (at least 1 hour per week). This generated the 
combinations: no caregiving at either wave; no caregiving at the 
first wave, caregiving at the second wave; caregiving at the first 
wave but not at the second; and caregiving at both waves.
Covariates
Selection of covariates was performed by drawing directed acyc-
lic graphs based on existing knowledge of factors which might 
affect both sleep disturbance and possibilities to provide infor-
mal care [35]. The sociodemographic variables of gender, age, 
marital status, and education were included in the analyses as 
possible confounders of the relationship between caring and 
sleep disturbance. Information regarding gender, age, education, 
and marital status (0 = married/cohabiting and 1 = nonmarried/
divorced/widowed/single) was obtained through linkage using 
individual person numbers to Statistics Sweden’s Longitudinal 
Individual Data Base (LISA) administrative register. Age was cen-
tered at its mean of 50 years. In order to model nonlinear rela-
tionships between age and sleep disturbance, squared and cubic 
functions of age were generated. Highest education level was 
grouped into the following categories: compulsory schooling; 
2 years upper secondary/vocational training or 4 years upper 
secondary; university or equivalent shorter than 3 years; and at 
least 3 years of university or equivalent.
T
wo variables recorded participants’ perceptions of whether 
their lives were affected by (1) any of a range of chronic con-
ditions and (2) physical pain or discomfort. These variables 
were included as confounders because such health problems 
might prevent carers from providing help to relatives and are 
also likely to increase sleep disturbance [36–38]. Specifically, 
participants indicated whether they had any of the follow-
ing chronic conditions (hypertension, cardiovascular disease, 
diabetes, rheumatic disorder, musculoskeletal disorder, men-
tal illness, asthma, obstructive pulmonary disease, migraine, 
physical disability, cancer, and other illness) and in a separate 
question whether they had experienced pain or discomfort over 
the previous 3 months (specifically headache, pain in the neck 
or shoulders, pain in the lower back, or other pain). For both 
variables, participants could respond: no; yes, but this does not 
affect their life at all; yes, this affects their life a little; or yes, this 
affects their life a lot. The two variables were dichotomized such 
that reports that chronic disease or pain/discomfort affected the 
participant’s life either a little or a lot were coded as 1, otherwise 
they were coded as 0.
Self-rated health and reports of depressive symptoms were 
included in the analyses as both potential confounders and 
mediators of the relationship between informal caregiving and 
sleep disturbance. To measure self-rated health, respondents 
were asked: “How would you rate your general state of health” 
with the responses: very good, good, neither good nor bad, quite 
poor, or very poor, a single-item measure of general physical 
and mental health which predicts mortality [39, 40]. A brief six-
item version of the Symptom Checklist Core Depression Scale 
(SCL-CD6) was used to measure depressive symptomatology 
[41–43]. Questions in this scale evaluate how much (from 0 = not 
at all to 4 = very much) participants were troubled by lethargy 
or low energy, feeling blue, blaming oneself, excessive worry-
ing, feelings of no interest in things, and feeling that everything 
is an effort. An overall score (0–24) was obtained by summing 
responses to all items.
Self-rated health and depressive symptoms were considered 
to be potential confounders of the informal caring–sleep rela-
tionship because poor self-rated health and depressive symp-
toms might prevent carers from providing help to relatives and 
also be likely to increase sleep disturbance. However, self-rated 
health and depressive symptoms might also mediate the rela-
tionship from informal caregiving to sleep disturbance; i.e., they 
may be on the causal path. Previous research has highlighted 
the importance of physical fatigue and tiredness to how peo-
ple evaluate their self-rated health [40, 44]. Furthermore, fatigue 
and sleep disturbance are common symptoms of depressive 
episodes in the ICD-10 classification of mental and behavioral 
disorders.
Paid work intensity was measured in four categories indicat-
ing time spent weekly in paid work created from participants’ 
reports (<10 hours, 10–19 hours, 20–29 hours, and ≥30 hours). This 
covariate could be both a confounder or mediator of the infor-
mal caring–sleep relationship: a confounder because time in paid 
work could affect both the number of hours dedicated to informal 
caregiving and sleep disturbance, and a mediator because hours 
spent providing informal care could lead to a decrease in hours 
of paid work, which in turn may affect sleep disturbance if, for 
example, this generated financial difficulties [45].
Statistical Methods
Statistical analysis was carried out in Stata 14.2 (Stata 
Corporation, College Station, TX, USA). We performed ran-
dom intercept (random effect) modeling, which allows the 
use of full information provided by longitudinal data, while 
accounting for the dependency of repeated measures within 
individuals [46]. These models use both the between- and 
within-subject components of the variability that are present 
in longitudinal data.
T
wo main analyses were performed, which both present 
results from the random intercept models as regression coef-
ficients with 95% confidence intervals. First, cross-sectional

 associations between intensity of informal caregiving (no care-
giving, up to 5 hours, and over 5 hours) and sleep disturbance 
were examined. The reference group contained participants 
who provided no informal care. These bivariate associations are 
presented as Model 1. In Model 2, variables were included that 
were considered to be potential confounders (sociodemograph-
ics, physical pain, and chronic disease) because they might affect 
both sleep disturbance and possibilities to provide informal 
care. In Model 3, additional variables (self-rated health, depres-
sive symptoms, and hours in paid work) were included which 
might be both confounders and mediators of the informal car-
ing–sleep relationship. In other words, in addition to being likely 
confounders, these factors may also lie on the causal pathway 
from informal caregiving to sleep disturbance. Consequently, 
adjusting on them may remove part or all of any effect of infor-
mal caregiving on sleep disturbance (overadjustment). Potential 
interactions between gender and care-giving intensity were also 
examined (Model 4).
Second, we examined changes in informal caregiving 
(whether providing any care or not) between two consecutive 
waves in relation to sleep disturbance at the second of the 
two waves, as well as in relation to change in sleep disturb-
ance between the waves. All of the changes between the four 
available waves were simultaneously modeled in random inter-
cept models. Covariates were taken from the second of the two 
waves. The reference group contained participants providing no 
informal care in either of the two waves.
RESULTS
Descriptive and bivariate statistics of the total study sample 
(N = 21604) are presented in Table 1 using information from 
the baseline survey year for each individual. Although most of 
the sample (18531 participants) did not report providing infor-
mal care at baseline, 2675 participants (12.4%) reported provid-
ing informal care up to 5 hours per week, and 398 participants 
(1.8%) reported higher number of hours of care. Caregivers were 
more likely to be female, be older, have a lower education level, 
report that their life was affected by physical pain or discomfort 
or by chronic illness, report poorer self-rated health, depressive 
symptoms, and sleep disturbance, and be in paid work under 20 
hours per week. In sensitivity analyses (not shown), caregivers 
had poorer physical and mental health as well as greater sleep 
disturbance even after controlling for the average older age of 
caregivers.
In the random effects model, presented in Table 2, informal 
care provision was associated with sleep disturbance before 
(Model 1) and after adjustment for possible socioeconomic and 
health confounders (Model 2). Specifically, after adjustment, 
compared with participants who were not providing informal 
care, those who were providing care up to 5 hours per week 
reported higher levels of sleep disturbance (β = 0.07; 95% CI: 0.04, 
0.09), whereas those who were providing over 5 hours of care 
reported highest levels of sleep disturbance (β = 0.17; 95% CI: 
0.11, 0.23). In Model 3, we adjusted for depressive symptoms, 
self-rated health and hours in paid work, and variables which 
could be both confounders and mediators of the association 
between caregiving and sleep. Following this adjustment, care-
giving was still associated with higher levels of reported sleep 
disturbance (up to 5 hours of care: β = 0.03; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.06 and 
over 5 hours of care: β = 0.08; 95% CI: 0.02, 0.13).
Gender interacted significantly with caring (Table 2, Model 4 
and Figure 1). Men who did not provide care and who provided 
up to 5 hours of care had similar levels of sleep disturbance. 
Both groups had significantly lower sleep disturbance than men 
who provided over 5 hours of care. Women who provided up to 
5 hours of informal care weekly reported slightly more sleep 
disturbance than women who provided no care; differences 
between those groups and women providing more than 5 hours 
of care were not discernible (Figure 1).
In Table 3, random effects models of change in caregiving 
on both sleep disturbance and change in sleep disturbance are 
presented. The left-hand set of analyses present change in care-
giving from one wave to the next on sleep disturbance at the 
second of the two waves. Compared with participants who did 
not provide informal care in either wave, those who provided 
care during at least one time point had greater sleep disturb-
ance both before (Model 1) and after adjustment (Model 2) for a 
range of possible confounders at the current wave. Specifically, 
compared with participants who did not provide informal care 
in either wave, those who provided care at both waves had sig-
nificantly greater sleep disturbance (β = 0.10; 95% CI: 0.04, 0.15), 
as did those who provided care only at the second of the two 
waves (β = 0.07; 95% CI: 0.03, 0.12), and those who provided care 
at the first, but not at the second wave (β = 0.05; 95% CI: 0.00, 
0.10). Results from Wald tests showed that differences in sleep

 disturbance among these three categories in which participants 
provided care in at least one wave were not significant at the 5% 
level. Only the coefficient for high sleep disturbance for those 
who were caring in both waves remained significant at the 95% 
level after including variables in Model 3 (self-rated health, 
depressive symptoms, and time spent in paid work), which may 
be both confounders and mediators of the caregiving–sleep 
relationship.
The right-hand set of analyses present change in caregiving 
from one wave to the next upon change in sleep disturbance 
over the same period. Compared with participants who did not 
provide informal care in either wave, providing caregiving at the 
previous but not the current wave was associated with a reduc-
tion in sleep disturbance over the same time period, results 
which changed little after adjustment for possible confounders 
and mediators (Model 2: β = −0.07; 95% CI: −0.12, −0.02 and Model 
3: β = −0.08; 95% CI: −0.13, −0.04). Results from Wald tests showed 
that this group who provided care only at the first wave also 
reported a reduction in sleep disturbance in comparison to the 
other two caregiving groups ( compared with caregiving only at 
the second wave: χ2: 7.85, p = .005; compared with caregiving 
at both waves: χ2: 4.45, p = .035). Performing caregiving in both 
waves and providing care only at the current wave were not 
associated with change in sleep disturbance compared with the 
reference group composed of participants who did not provide 
care at either wave.
Discussion
In this large sample of Swedish people in paid work, provid-
ing informal care predicted higher levels of self-reported sleep 
disturbance, particularly when more than 5 hours of care per 
week were provided, associations which were robust to inclu-
sion of demographic and health covariates as well as time in 
paid work. These results correspond to previous research sug-
gesting that informal caregiving impacts on self-reported and 
objective sleep [22–24, 47]. and that providing informal care for a 
higher number of hours is more strongly associated with sleep 
disturbance [48, 49], Studies have shown that provision of night-
time care is associated with poorer self-reported sleep [49], as 
is (albeit inconsistently) when carers and care recipients are 
coresident [50–52], It might be expected that providing relatively

 low intensity of informal care (up to 5 hours a week) would be 
associated with better sleep through the mechanism of role 
enhancement. However, in this Swedish working sample, even 
low intensity caregiving was associated with self-reported sleep 
disturbance, suggesting that in-work carers may be experienc-
ing stress generated by role overload in managing the compet-
ing commitments of paid work and informal caregiving.
In terms of the stress process model, in which primary stress-
ors generated by informal caregiving lead to problems in other 
domains, such as job-caregiving conflicts [53], such role over-
load may be generated due to the difficulty of apportioning time 
and energy to two relatively inflexible activities [54]. In-work 
carers have partial control at best over the timing of caregiv-
ing and paid work activities, leading to scheduling difficulties 
(e.g., providing care at unpredictable times, at night, and during 
the working week), and the difficulty of catching up on sleep 
during the day due to the fixed timing of most jobs. Informal 
caregiving, unlike other unremunerated activities, is often per-
formed out of a sense of moral obligation, particularly when the 
care recipient is a close family member, leaving some caregivers 
with little or no choice about engaging in caregiving [55]. The 
impacts of caregiving upon sleep disturbance extend beyond 
the time taken for care tasks: caregivers may be on 24-hour call 
[21, 56] and the emotional labor involved in caregiving can gen-
erate substantial worry and distress. Accordingly, introduction 
of depressive symptoms and self-rated health into the models 
attenuated the relationship between provision of informal care 
and sleep disturbance. This result accords with prior research 
which has highlighted the comorbidity of insomnia symptoms 
with depression [24] and self-rated health [57], and found cross-
sectional and longitudinal associations between sleep and affect 
in caregivers [25, 58, 59].
In contrast to a previous study which failed to find gender 
differences in the impact of caregiving upon sleeping problems 
[50], we found significant interactions between gender and infor-
mal caring in relation to sleep disturbance, specifically similar 
levels of sleep disturbance in men providing no caregiving and 
up to 5 hours of caregiving and much higher sleep disturbance 
among men providing more than 5 hours of care. Women had 
higher levels of sleep disturbance overall; differences among

 women by caregiving status were smaller than among men. It 
is possible that gender differences in sleep disturbance at mod-
erate levels of caregiving are due to different tasks being per-
formed by male and female carers, e.g., more personal care and 
routine tasks being performed by female carers [60,61]. Higher 
intensity caregiving is more often spousal care, where gender 
differences in care tasks are smaller [60]. It would be valuable for 
future research to examine gender differences in large samples, 
where information about the carer burden, who is cared for and 
the tasks performed, is available, in order to examine possible 
mechanisms generating gendered differences in the impact of 
caregiving upon sleep disturbance.
Relatively little prior research has examined the relationship 
between starting and stopping provision of informal care and 
sleep disturbance, an approach which provides additional evi-
dence for the direction of effects. We found that, compared with 
not providing informal care in either wave, patterns of caregiv-
ing between two study waves that would correspond to begin-
ning, terminating, or continuing to provide informal care were 
associated with higher sleep disturbance at the second of those 
study waves. The finding that reporting providing care only at 
the first wave was associated with sleep disturbance at the sec-
ond wave is in line with qualitative research suggesting that 
sleep disturbance extends beyond the end of informal care pro-
vision [62].
In analyses relating changes in sleep disturbance from 
one wave to the next to patterns of caregiving over the same 
period, individuals who provided informal care only at the first 
wave (which would correspond to ceasing caregiving) experi-
enced improved self-reported sleep compared with the refer-
ence group of participants not providing informal care at either 
wave. These results point to cessation of caregiving generating 
reductions in sleep disturbance, even if not to the level of those 
who had not provided informal care at either wave. They stand 
in contrast to the sole earlier study examining transitions out 
of caregiving, which used a small sample of spousal Alzheimer 
caregivers and differentiated caregiving ceasing as a result of 
spousal institutionalization or death [26]. That study, by von 
Känel et al., found no impact on self-reported or objective sleep 
measures of spousal institutionalization and a negative impact 
of spousal death on nighttime wakening and sleep time (meas-
ured with actigraph data), but no effect on self-reported sleep 
complaints.
Strengths and Limitations
The major strengths of this study are its use of a validated 
measure of sleep disturbance with good measurement prop-
erties in a longitudinal analysis of a large sample with a wide 
range of demographic and health covariates. In addition, the 
random effects model is a robust approach to dealing with 
unbalanced panels and missing data due to attrition, which is 
generally found in longitudinal analyses. Rather than having to 
assume that data are missing completely at random, random 
effects models make the less restrictive missing at random 
assumption, i.e., the propensity for data to be missing is not 
related to the missing data after accounting for relationships 
with observed data [63–65]. However, the study has certain limi-
tations: first, although the original sample of the SLOSH study 
was drawn from a representative sample of the Swedish popu-
lation within the age-range 16–64 years (i.e., the Swedish Labour 
Force Survey), the findings are not generalizable to those work-
ing less than 30% of full-time or outside this age range. In add-
ition, selective attrition from the SLOSH study has taken place, 
with SLOSH respondents more likely than nonrespondents to 
be older, female, married, Swedish-born, with university quali-
fications, and to work in the government sector. Second, it is 
possible that individuals with disturbed sleep are less likely to 
provide informal care, as a result of the impact of health con-
ditions associated with disturbed sleep (e.g., depression and 
chronic pain). Although this would have a conservative effect on 
the results, weakening the caregiving–sleep disturbance associ-
ations, such reverse causation has been reduced by taking such 
health variables into account. Third, although we were able to 
control for a wide range of demographic and health variables, 
there may be residual confounding related to unobserved char-
acteristics which could generate a spurious positive association 
between participation in informal care and sleep disturbance. 
Consequently, we performed a sensitivity analysis using fixed 
effect modeling, which partials out unobserved time-invariant

 individual differences as well as baseline differences in sleep 
disturbance by utilizing only information on changes in depend-
ent and independent variables within individuals. The results 
are presented in Supplementary Table S1 and confirm the con-
clusions presented in the main analyses. Fourth, measures of 
care-giving were only provided at each wave; therefore, it was 
not possible to ascertain what was happening between the 
waves, e.g., whether a carer providing care at two consecutive 
waves had been providing care continuously during the 2-year 
period between those waves. Last, it was only possible to exam-
ine associations with weekly hours of care provision because the 
SLOSH study lacks information about the nature of tasks per-
formed and characteristics of the care recipient (e.g., whether 
co-resident, nature of disability, or illness), an important avenue 
for future research in large, community-based samples.
Concluding Remarks
This study has found that among workers, providing informal 
care is an independent predictor of sleep disturbance after con-
trolling for demographic and health variables. Even low-inten-
sity caregiving, measured in hours per week, was associated 
with self-reported sleep disturbance. Sleep disturbance among 
carers is an under-recognized and under-treated problem [24], 
which is related to a variety of serious health outcomes, includ-
ing major depressive disorder and physical health complaints. 
The data are from Sweden, a country with a welfare model aim-
ing to minimize conflict between paid work and caring commit-
ments among informal carers, although recent years have seen 
cuts to formal care services [66]. A promising avenue for further 
research may be to investigate the caregiving–sleep disturb-
ance association in diverse welfare and social care contexts [67]. 
That a caregiving–sleep association was observed in a country 
with relatively comprehensive formal care provision suggests 
the need for policy actors everywhere to consider measures to 
support employed caregivers, concerning both government and 
employers, as well as to protect formal care services. Since it 
appears that informal carers are at a high risk of sleep disturb-
ance, improved recognition and management by healthcare 
staff of sleeping problems in carers may also improve carers’ 
health and quality of life.
