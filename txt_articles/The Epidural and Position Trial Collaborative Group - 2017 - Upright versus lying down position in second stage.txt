Upright versus lying down position in second stage of labour in 
nulliparous women with low dose epidural: BUMPES randomised 
controlled trial
The Epidural and Position Trial Collaborative Group
ABSTRACT
OBJECTIVE
To determine whether being upright in the second 
stage of labour in nulliparous women with a low dose 
epidural increases the chance of spontaneous vaginal 
birth compared with lying down.
DESIGN
Multicentre pragmatic individually randomised 
controlled trial.
SETTING
41 UK hospital labour wards.
PARTICIPANTS
3093 nulliparous women aged 16 or older, at term 
with a singleton cephalic presentation and in the 
second stage of labour with epidural analgesia.
INTERVENTIONS
Women were allocated to an upright or lying down 
position, using a secure web based randomisation 
service, stratified by centre, with no masking of 
participants or clinicians to the trial interventions.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
The primary outcome was spontaneous vaginal birth. 
Women were analysed in the groups into which they 
were randomly allocated, regardless of position 
recorded at any time during the second stage of 
labour (excluding women with no valid consent, who 
withdrew, or who did not reach second stage before 
delivery). Secondary outcomes included mode of 
birth, perineal trauma, infant Apgar score <4 at five 
minutes, admission to a neonatal unit, and longer term 
included maternal physical and psychological health, 
incontinence, and infant gross developmental delay. 
RESULTS
Between 4 October 2010 and 31 January 2014, 3236 
women were randomised and 3093 (95.6%) included 
in the primary analysis (1556 in the upright group and 
1537 in the lying down group). Significantly fewer 
spontaneous vaginal births occurred in women in 
the upright group: 35.2% (548/1556) compared with 
41.1% (632/1537) in the lying down group (adjusted 
risk ratio 0.86, 95% confidence interval 0.78 to 0.94). 
This represents a 5.9% absolute increase in the 
chance of spontaneous vaginal birth in the lying down 
group (number needed to treat 17, 95% confidence 
interval 11 to 40). No evidence of differences was 
found for most of the secondary maternal, neonatal, or 
longer term outcomes including instrumental vaginal 
delivery (adjusted risk ratio 1.08, 99% confidence 
interval 0.99 to 1.18), obstetric anal sphincter injury 
(1.27, 0.88 to 1.84), infant Apgar score <4 at five 
minutes (0.66, 0.06 to 6.88), and maternal faecal 
incontinence at one year (1.18, 0.61 to 2.28).
CONCLUSIONS
Evidence shows that lying down in the second stage 
of labour results in more spontaneous vaginal births 
in nulliparous women with epidural analgesia, with no 
apparent disadvantages in relation to short or longer 
term outcomes for mother or baby.
TRIAL REGISTRATION
Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN35706297.
Introduction
As the most effective form of pain relief in labour, 
epidural analgesia is chosen by approximately 30% 
of women in the UK each year, and this proportion 
has remained relatively stable over the past decade.1 2 
Epidural analgesia leads to prolongation of the second 
stage of labour (from full dilation of the cervix until 
birth) and an increased risk of instrumental vaginal 
delivery. However, this evidence comes mostly from 
trials that used epidural techniques which cause 
dense neuraxial blockade.3 Epidurals that use low 
dose local anaesthetic in combination with opioids 
result in a lower risk of instrumental vaginal delivery, 
but the rate of such delivery is still higher than among 
women with no epidural.4 5 Maternal position during 
the second stage of labour has been suggested to affect 
the risk of instrumental vaginal delivery. A Cochrane 
review of position in the second stage of labour in 
women without epidural showed a reduction in 
instrumental vaginal delivery in the upright group, 
although the quality of the included trials was reported 
to be generally poor.6 Maternal mobility is limited with 
dense neuraxial blockade. Low dose epidurals preserve 
motor function, allowing greater mobility throughout 
labour and enabling women to adopt upright 
positions. A Cochrane review of position in the second 
stage of labour for women with epidural analgesia

WhAT IS AlReAdy knoW on ThIS TopIC
Women who use an epidural for pain relief in labour are more likely to have an 
instrumental vaginal birth than those who use other methods of analgesia
Maternal position in the second stage of labour (after the cervix is fully dilated) 
may affect the incidence of spontaneous vaginal birth, but the existing evidence 
from randomised controlled trials is unclear
WhAT ThIS STudy AddS
In nulliparous women in labour at term with an epidural and a singleton fetus, a 
policy of adopting a lying down position (left or right lateral) during the second 
stage of labour increases the chance of spontaneous vaginal birth compared with 
a policy of adopting an upright position
There were no adverse consequences of this approach for mother or baby in the

was published in 2017, after the current (Birth in the 
Upright Maternal Position with Epidural in Second 
stage: BUMPES) trial was started. This review included 
trials that compared upright with recumbent positions 
and suggested no effect. The risk ratio of operative birth 
(caesarean section or instrumental vaginal delivery) 
reported in the five included trials, comprising 879 
women in total, was 0.97 (95% confidence interval 
0.76 to 1.25).7 In this group of women therefore, the 
debate remains about whether an upright posture in 
the second stage of labour increases the incidence of 
spontaneous vaginal birth.8 9
The aim of the BUMPES trial was to evaluate 
whether, in nulliparous women with low dose epidural 
analgesia, being upright during the second stage of 
labour increased the chance of spontaneous vaginal 
birth, compared with lying down.
Methods
Study design and participants
This was a pragmatic randomised controlled trial 
carried out in UK maternity units. Women were eligible 
for the trial if they were 16 years or older, were at 37 
weeks or more gestation, nulliparous (no previous 
birth ≥24+0 weeks’ gestation), had a singleton cephalic 
presentation, and intended to have a spontaneous 
vaginal birth. They had to be in the second stage of 
labour, have a low dose epidural in situ (administered 
according to local unit protocol) during the first stage 
of labour that provided effective pain relief, and be 
able to understand documents in English and provide 
written answers in English.
Women were provided with written information 
about the trial during pregnancy and again in labour. 
They could give written informed consent during 
the first stage of labour but were not eligible to be 
randomised until the second stage of labour had been 
confirmed. Diagnosis was based on usual clinical 
criteria, either when the cervix was fully dilated 
on a vaginal examination (no additional vaginal 
examinations were specified as part of the trial 
protocol) or when the presenting part was visible.
Randomisation and masking
Women were randomised to the allocated intervention 
(allocation ratio 1:1) using a secure web based central 
randomisation service hosted by the National Perinatal 
Epidemiology Unit Clinical Trials Unit, University of 
Oxford. To ensure that the recruiting staff could not 
reliably predict the next allocation, the randomisation 
schedule used random permuted blocks of sizes 
2, 4, 6, 8, and 10, randomly selected according to 
the ratio specified by Pascals’ triangle (1:4:6:8:10). 
Stratification was by centre. Owing to the nature of the 
intervention, it was not possible to mask the women or 
clinicians to the trial intervention.
Procedures
Women were allocated to a policy of an upright 
position, which would maintain the pelvis in as vertical 
a plane as possible during the second stage of labour, 
with the intention of continuing the allocated position 
until the birth (this could include walking, standing, 
sitting out of bed, supported kneeling, bolt upright in 
an obstetric bed, or any other upright position for as 
much of the second stage as possible); or a lying down 
position (left or right lateral, to prevent aorto-caval 
compression, with up to 30 degrees inclination of the 
bed), which would maintain the pelvis in as horizontal 
a plane as possible during the second stage of 
labour, with the intention of continuing the allocated 
position until the birth. Because midwives in the UK 
routinely provide care for women in labour, they 
administered the intervention. Before the start of the 
trial, the midwives received training to emphasise the 
importance of supporting mothers in their allocated 
position, especially for the passive second stage of 
labour (the period before pushing commences, which 
can last one to two hours). As this trial was pragmatic 
we expected that there would be “unavoidable” 
reasons for changing maternal position—for example, 
fetal distress, fetal blood sampling, or to help improve 
pushing in the active second stage. Women were free to 
change position if they wished at any stage after trial 
entry.
From hospital notes we collected information at 
trial entry about maternal characteristics (including 
index of multiple deprivation,10 an area measure of 
deprivation derived from the mother’s postcode), 
pregnancy complications, and progress of labour 
before trial entry. Data on adherence to the allocated 
intervention were collected every 15 minutes when the 
attending midwife recorded what position the woman 
was in “for the majority of the time since the last 
assessment” and, if this position had changed from 
the allocated position, recorded the reasons for this 
change. Information on clinical outcome after birth as 
well as neonatal outcomes and hospital inpatient stay 
was collected after the birth from hospital records. As 
soon as possible after delivery, the woman was asked to 
complete a one page questionnaire about satisfaction 
with her birth experience (see supplementary 
appendix). Women with infants who survived and 
resided with them were followed up at one year using 
a self administered postal questionnaire asking about 
specific health problems and their general health and 
wellbeing, as well as that of their baby.
Outcomes
The primary outcome measure was spontaneous 
vaginal birth. Secondary short term outcomes were 
instrumental vaginal delivery (forceps and ventouse), 
caesarean section, augmentation of labour, major 
interventions 
to 
maintain 
blood 
pressure 
(eg, 
vasopressors), hypotension (systolic blood pressure 
<100 mm Hg before delivery), application of fetal scalp 
electrode, fetal blood sampling, total doses of epidural 
local anaesthetic and opioids administered after 
randomisation, duration of active second stage (time 
from pushing to delivery), duration of second stage of 
labour (time from randomisation to delivery), additional 
anaesthesia 
used

operative 
delivery,

management of the third stage, episiotomy, pain during 
delivery (assessed using a visual analogue scale, with 
0 as no pain and 10 as worst pain imaginable), genital 
tract trauma, manual removal of the placenta, primary 
postpartum haemorrhage requiring blood transfusion, 
duration of maternal inpatient stay after delivery, and 
satisfaction with the experience of birth. For the neonate, 
secondary outcomes were metabolic acidosis (cord 
artery pH <7.05 in second stage, with base deficit ≥12 
mmol/L), presence of meconium stained liquor, Apgar 
score <4 at five minutes, resuscitation at birth, skin to 
skin contact within the first hour of birth, initiation of 
breast feeding within the first hour of birth, duration 
of neonatal inpatient stay, and admission to neonatal 
unit and duration of stay. Secondary outcomes at one 
year for the mother were urinary incontinence, faecal 
incontinence, other bowel problems, dyspareunia, 
general physical and psychological health, and health 
related quality of life measured with the EQ-5D-3L 
and SF-12 instruments.11 12 Secondary outcomes at 
one year for the infant were major morbidity (eg, gross 
neurodevelopmental delay, including cerebral palsy) 
and hospital admissions.
Statistical analysis
Assuming a rate for the primary outcome of 
spontaneous vaginal birth of 55% in the control group 
(derived from data published from the COMET trial4) 
and a two sided 5% significance level, we required a 
sample size of 3000 women. This had 90% power to 
detect an absolute difference of 6% in the spontaneous 
vaginal birth rate between the two policies, equivalent 
to a risk ratio of 1.11. On collation of the pilot data for 
an interim analysis presented to the independent data 
monitoring committee in 2011, it was recognised that 
the combined primary outcome event rate was lower 
than anticipated, at 34%, 95% confidence interval 
26% to 42% (based on 49/145 events, combining 
upright and lying down groups). With a reduction 
in the control group event rate (from an anticipated 
55% to between 30% and 40%), keeping the sample 
size fixed at 3000 meant that a risk ratio of between 
1.13 and 1.19 would be detectable, equivalent to an 
absolute risk increase of 5% to 6%. Although power 
was insufficient to detect a risk ratio as small as the 
planned 1.11, the absolute risk detectable was similar 
and the trial steering committee agreed that changes to 
the target sample size were unnecessary.
Before analysis of the trial data the trial steering 
committee developed and approved a detailed 
statistical analysis plan. Women were analysed in 
the groups into which they were randomly allocated, 
regardless of position recorded at any time during the 
second stage of labour (an intention to treat analysis). 
We excluded women from the analysis if a valid 
consent form was not received by the central study 
team, consent to use their data was withdrawn, they 
were not in second stage of labour when randomised 
and did not reach second stage before delivery, or they 
were not in labour or without an epidural in place at the 
time of randomisation. All comparative analyses were 
performed using generalised linear models with centre 
as a random intercept. Binary outcomes were analysed 
using log binomial regression models, and results are 
presented as adjusted risk ratios with corresponding 
confidence intervals. Where possible we analysed 
continuous outcomes using linear regression models, 
and results are presented as adjusted differences 
in means with associated confidence intervals. 
Unadjusted Hodges-Lehmann median differences (plus 
confidence intervals) for skewed continuous variables 
are presented. The geometric mean indicates the 
central tendency or typical value of a set of numbers 
by using the product of their values (as opposed to the 
arithmetic mean which uses their sum) and is used 
for summarising skewed data. Comparative analysis 
uses a ratio of the geometric means instead of the 
mean difference and therefore a ratio of 1 indicates 
no difference between the groups. For the primary 
outcome we present 95% confidence intervals, and for 
all other outcomes 99% confidence intervals to allow 
for cautious interpretation of the results.13
Positions recorded were categorised according to 
whether the women were lying down, upright, or in 
“other” positions for each 15 minute interval. Positions 
recorded as lithotomy were categorised as “lying down” 
since the pelvis is in a horizontal position. A summary 
of adherence to allocated position is reported by trial 
arm for the passive second stage (ie, before pushing 
commenced), the active second stage (ie, pushing), and 
the whole of the second stage. Summaries of adherence 
data were calculated as the proportion of 15 minute 
intervals a woman spent in the position to which she 
was allocated out of the total number of 15 minute 
intervals recorded in the passive, active, or whole of 
the second stage of labour. Medians and interquartile 
ranges are presented owing to the skewed distribution 
of the data. Hodges-Lehmann differences in medians 
with corresponding 95% confidence intervals are 
presented by randomised group. The trial statistician 
and an independent clinical assessor reviewed and 
classified all reasons for changes in position as 
avoidable or unavoidable. Periods where changes to a 
non-allocated position were considered necessary for 
unavoidable reasons were treated as adherent.
The 
self 
completed 
maternal 
satisfaction 
questionnaire included a question about what 
position the women were in for most of the time 
during the passive and active stages of labour, with 
responses “lying down,” “upright,” “other,” and “can’t 
remember.” We summarise these data by trial arm 
using counts and percentages.
To examine whether the effect of the policy of position 
during the second stage of labour was consistent 
across prespecified subgroups, we undertook the 
following subgroup analyses: gestational age (37+0 to 
38+6; 39+0 to 40+6; and ≥41+0); maternal age (≤24, 
25-29, 30-34, ≥35); augmentation with oxytocin in the 
first stage of labour (yes or no); and index of multiple 
deprivation (population based fifths 1 to 5).

outcome to investigate the impact of known prognostic

factors (age, ethnicity, diagnosis of delay, onset of 
labour—induced versus spontaneous).
On a restricted dataset we carried out a sensitivity 
analysis on the one year maternal outcomes, excluding 
all women who were pregnant or had had another 
child at the time of completing the one year follow-up 
questionnaire.
The time from randomisation to trial entry, and all 
other durations, are prone to errors because of time dif-
ferences recorded in different locations of the maternity 
units. The time of randomisation is accurate as this was 
recorded by the computer server providing the randomi-
sation service. However, all other times depended on the 
accuracy of the clocks in the different locations. For ex-
ample, the clock on the central midwifery station might 
have read a slightly different time to that in the labour 
room, and these might both have been different from 
the clock in theatre. Many relatively minor problems 
occurred with derived duration variables in the dataset 
(eg, negative values), suggesting variation in actual time 
recorded between different settings. Stata version 13 was 
used for all analyses.
The trial was overseen by a trial steering committee 
and an independent data monitoring committee. 
The data monitoring committee used the Haybittle-
Peto approach to stopping guidelines for interim 
analyses using three standard errors as the cut-off for 
consideration of early cessation, preserving the type 1 
error across the trial.14
Patient and public involvement
The public was involved throughout the design, 
conduct, analysis, and interpretation of this trial. One 
patient and public involvement co-investigator (MN) 
attended all the planning meetings and was involved 
in drafting the funding application, developing the 
detailed trial protocol and data collection forms, 
conducting the trial meetings, and writing the report 
and paper. MN took a lead in helping the team develop 
participant information leaflets to be used in the 
antenatal period and at the time of labour, as well as 
helping plan dissemination activities and drafting and 
developing the summary information for the public.
Results
Between 4 October 2010 and 31 January 2014, 3236 
women were randomised to the BUMPES trial from 41 
participating centres (fig 1 and see supplementary table). 
This deliberate over-recruitment was to compensate 
for women being excluded from the analysis. A total 
of 143/3236 women (4.4%) were excluded from the 
analysis of the primary outcome (fig 1). Most of these 
exclusions were because of missing or incomplete 
consent forms. For 32 women, exclusion was because 
they were randomised in error. Data at the time of 
birth were available for 100% of women recruited and 
analysed. Follow-up data at one year were received 
from 1892/3093 (61.2%) women. The median time to 
completion of the questionnaire from birth was 11.9 
months (interquartile range 11.7-12.7) in each group.
Baseline characteristics were broadly similar 
between the two arms of the trial (table 1). Most of the 
women in both arms were between 37 and 41 completed 
weeks of pregnancy, although 7.5% (231/3093) of 
women were 42 weeks or more. The majority of women 
participating in the trial were of white ethnic origin 
and the mean body mass index at booking was just 
over 25 kg/m2. Approximately 40% of women had their 
labour induced. About 80% of women could perform 
a straight leg raise at the time of trial entry suggesting 
that they had reasonable mobility with their epidural 
analgesia. There was an apparent disparity between 
the two groups in the position of the women at the time 
of trial entry; a greater proportion of women who were 
lying down in the group allocated lying down compared 
with those in the upright position. The way these data 
were requested is likely to have led to misclassification 
of this variable, in that midwives may have recorded 
the position of the women at the time of allocation (ie, 
after they had already assumed the allocated position). 
As all other characteristics of the women were similar 
at baseline it seems unlikely that this represents the 
true position at the time of randomisation; rather it is a 
combination of this plus actual allocation.
Adherence to the intervention was generally good. 
The median proportion of time spent in the allocated 
position during the passive second stage (before 
pushing commenced) was 1.0 (interquartile range 1.0-
1.0) in the upright group and 1.0 (0.67-1.0) in the lying 
down group (median difference 0, 95% confidence 
interval 0 to 0). As anticipated, adherence was poorer in 
the active second stage, with the median proportion of 
time spent in the allocated position 0.88 (0.60-1.0) in 
the upright group and 0.75 (0.38-1.0) in the lying down 
group (median difference 0, 0 to 0) (table 2, fig 2). The

information provided by women about their position 
in labour was broadly similar to this, with 75.8% 
(794/1047) of women in the upright group stating that 
they were mostly in the upright position during the 
passive stage and 72.3% (752/1040) of women in the 
lying down group stating they were mostly lying down. 
In the active stage, 72.5% (745/1028) of women in 
the upright group recalled being mostly upright, and 
63.7% (652/1024) of women in the lying down group 
recalled mostly lying down (table 2).
A clear statistically significant difference (at the 
5% level) in the incidence of the primary outcome of 
spontaneous vaginal birth was found between the 
groups, with 35.2% (548/1556) of women achieving 
spontaneous vaginal birth in the upright group 
compared with 41.1% (632/1537) in the lying down 
group (adjusted risk ratio 0.86, 95% confidence 
interval 0.78 to 0.94) (table 3). This represents a 5.9% 
absolute increase in the chance of spontaneous vaginal 
birth in the lying down group (number needed to treat 
17, 95% confidence interval 11 to 40). This result was 
unchanged when adjusting for age, ethnicity, diagnosis 
of delay, and the nature of the onset of labour (adjusted 
risk ratio 0.86, 95% confidence interval 0.79 to 0.94).
We found no evidence of a difference for most of the 
secondary maternal outcomes after study entry and 
during the second stage of labour (tables 3 and 4). The 
duration of the active second stage of labour showed a 
statistically significant difference at the 1% level, with 
a shorter duration of labour in the lying down group 
(median difference of 7 minutes, 99% confidence 
interval 0 to 13). Other secondary maternal outcomes, 
such as instrumental vaginal delivery, caesarean 
section and perineal trauma, were suggestive of an

increased risk associated with the upright position, but 
these differences were not statistically significant at 
the 1% level. For example, the incidence of episiotomy 
increased in the upright group (58.8%, 914/1556) 
compared with the lying down group (54.6%, 
838/1537) (although not statistically significant at 
the 1% level). There seemed to be a higher incidence 
of obstetric anal sphincter injury in the upright group 
(6.7%, 104/1556) compared with the lying down 
group (5.3%, 81/1537), but again this difference was 
not statistically significant at the 1% level (table 3).
Infant outcomes were good, with few babies 
having a low Apgar score at five minutes or evidence 
of metabolic acidosis. Overall, about 12% of babies 
required resuscitation at birth (table 4).
Maternal satisfaction in labour was similar between 
the two groups (table 5); however, only half of the 
 
women reported being able to move as much as they 
wanted. Few adverse events occurred. Mothers experi-
enced dizziness (n=29 in the upright group and n=21 
in the lying down group), postpartum haemorrhage 
(n=1 in each group), seizure (n=2 in lying down group), 
stroke (n=1 in the lying down group), maternal infec-
tion (n=1 in the upright group and n=2 in the lying 
down group), dural tap (n=1 in the upright group) and 
postpartum haemorrhage with retained placenta (n=1 
in the upright group). Of infants born to mothers in the 
upright group one was a stillbirth, one experienced 
birth trauma, one had cardiorespiratory collapse one 
hour post birth, and one had suspected Erb’s palsy.
The 
prespecified 
subgroup 
analyses 
showed 
no evidence of heterogeneity between any of the 
prespecified subgroups for the primary outcome of 
spontaneous vaginal birth (fig 3).
No evidence of any differences between the groups was 
found for incidence or severity of urinary incontinence, 
faecal incontinence, constipation, haemorrhoids or dys-
pareunia, general wellbeing, or health related quality 
of life (table 6). This finding was unchanged in a sensi-
tivity analysis where women were excluded if they were 
pregnant or had another child by the time of the one year 
follow-up (table 7). Similarly, there was no evidence of a 
difference in the incidence of diagnosed cerebral palsy 
or severe neurodevelopmental delay in any of the infants 
at one year: major morbidity was experienced by 0.1% 
(1/950) in the upright group and 0.4% (4/942) in the ly-
ing down group, with a risk ratio adjusted for centre as a 
random effect of 0.25 (99% confidence interval 0.01 to 
4.40). The response rate to the one year follow-up was 
61.2% (1892/3093). There were differences between 
women who responded and those who did not respond, 
with responders tending to be slightly older, white, and 
from less deprived areas, and more likely to have an in-
strumental vaginal birth with evidence of perineal trau-
ma. However, there were no apparent differences in the 
two randomised groups in their response rates or char-
acteristics, suggesting no major biases in the comparison 
between the two groups (table 8).
discussion
Evidence from this randomised controlled trial 
indicates that a policy of adopting a lying down 
position in the second stage of labour in women having 
their first baby with epidural analgesia increases the 
chances of a spontaneous vaginal birth (number 
needed to treat 17 women (95% confidence interval 11 
to 40) to achieve one additional spontaneous vaginal 
birth). No disadvantages were apparent to short or 
longer term outcomes for mother or baby.
Strengths and limitations of this study
As with all pragmatic trials, this study has limitations. 
The incidence of spontaneous vaginal birth in this 
population of women was lower than anticipated. 
Our original sample size calculation was based on a 
spontaneous vaginal birth rate of approximately 55% 
in the control group.4 This trend towards higher rates 
of intervention in the second stage of labour—both 
instrumental delivery and caesarean section—has been 
previously noted.15 Instrumental delivery is associated 
with high rates of perineal trauma and subsequent 
morbidity, particularly faecal incontinence.
With an intervention such as this, masking is 
impossible, so the results may be influenced by the 
women’s and the midwives’ perceptions of the different 
positions in their ability to achieve a spontaneous

vaginal birth. Given that existing guidance from the 
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 
recommends that women with an epidural should be 
encouraged to adopt whatever upright position they 
find comfortable, it is perhaps not surprising that 
adherence was lower in the lying down group than in 
the upright group, causing a possible dilution of the 
treatment effect.16 Owing to the unmasked nature 
of the intervention and the possibility that some 
midwives may firmly believe that the upright position 
is preferable, we might also expect the trial results to 
suggest an improvement in spontaneous vaginal birth 
with an upright position. The finding that the lying 
down position increased the chances of achieving a

spontaneous vaginal birth suggests that this potential 
bias was either absent or minimal in its impact, or that 
the benefit of the lying down position may be even 
greater in leading to a spontaneous vaginal birth.
We can only speculate about the mechanism 
by which lying down increases the chance of a 
spontaneous vaginal birth in nulliparous women with 
a low dose epidural. We have no direct measurements 
of the density of the epidural block in the two positions 
nor the level of the block as second stage progressed. It 
is possible that women in the upright position acquired 
a denser block around the birth canal resulting from the 
potential effects of posture and gravity on the spread of 
drugs within the epidural space, which could in turn 
have made expulsive efforts less effective. However, the 
similarity of drug doses throughout the second stage of 
labour used in each group would suggest that this is 
unlikely. Women in the upright group, who may have 
been sitting, might have had a restricted pelvic outlet 
because of pressure on their coccyx or because of 
venous obstruction causing lower genital tract oedema 
and obstruction of the soft tissues of the pelvic outlet. 
In addition, it is possible that the lying down group, 
by easing pressure of the fetal head on the pelvis had 
improved uterine blood flow and therefore improved 
uterine activity. This would suggest a difference in the 
risk of operative delivery associated with failure to 
progress. The distribution of indications for operative 
delivery, however, appeared to be the same in either 
group. In addition, little difference was found in the 
use of oxytocin because of delay in labour progress 
after trial entry.
There was a suggestion that perineal trauma might 
also have been decreased in the lying down group, 
although differences in these inter-related outcomes 
were not statistically significant at our prespecified 1% 
level. A recent large observational study from Sweden, 
using routine data, found a statistically significant 
lower incidence of obstetric anal sphincter injury in 
women in the lateral position compared with the sitting

group (risk ratio 0.79, 95% confidence interval 0.68 to 
0.92).17 This result is similar to our finding (adjusted 
risk ratio 0.79, 95% confidence interval 0.59 to 1.04). 
Given that an increase in spontaneous vaginal births 
results in a decrease in operative births, it would follow 
that perineal trauma would be increased in the group 
with more instrumental deliveries. There is also a 
suggestion (not statistically significant at the 1% level) 
that instrumental vaginal delivery might be increased 
in the upright group in this trial.
In this trial the lack of any difference on longer term 
outcomes such as faecal incontinence is of interest. The 
existing observation that instrumental vaginal delivery is 
associated with an increased risk of faecal incontinence 
is robust.18-21 The likely explanation in this trial is that 
the difference between the randomised groups of women 
in their risk of spontaneous vaginal birth was relatively 
small, meaning that the impact of different modes of 
birth on long term outcomes is diluted.
Comparison with other studies
The existing evidence from randomised controlled 
trials is inconclusive. The Cochrane review7 contains 
five trials including a total of 879 women, with clinical 
heterogeneity between the trials. For example, some 
women were actively encouraged to walk, and others 
were supported in a sitting position in the upright 
group. In the recumbent group, some trials had women 
sitting and others had women in a lateral position. 
This trial adds a further 3000 women to this evidence, 
with clearly defined comparison groups. When these 
data are added to the three most comparable trials—
that is, those where women were allocated upright 
versus lying down positions (as opposed to semi-
recumbent positions), then the sum of the evidence 
strongly supports a lying down position to achieve 
a spontaneous vaginal birth (upright versus lying 
down meta-analysis odds ratio 0.80, 95% confidence 
interval 0.70 to 0.92).
Conclusions and policy implications
This study provides evidence that adopting a lying 
down position in the second stage of labour results 
in more spontaneous vaginal births in nulliparous 
women with epidural analgesia, with no apparent 
disadvantages for short or longer term outcomes for 
mother or baby. The intervention seems to be easy 
to adopt and is cost free. This evidence will allow 
pregnant women, in consultation with their healthcare 
providers, to make informed choices about their 
position in the second stage of labour.
The results from this trial apply to nulliparous women 
in the second stage of labour with epidural analgesia. 
It is unclear what the findings mean for multiparous 
women in labour with an epidural. However, women 
should be offered the choice of adopting a lying down 
position in the second stage until proven otherwise. We 
also do not know what these results mean for women 
of all parities without an epidural. Given the variable 
quality of existing randomised trials of position in the 
second stage of labour in women without an epidural,6 
the results of the BUMPES trial strongly support the 
development of a similar large pragmatic trial with 
clear operational descriptions of position in women in 
labour without epidural analgesia.
We thank the women who agreed to join the trial.
