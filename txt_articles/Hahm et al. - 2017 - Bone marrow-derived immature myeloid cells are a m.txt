Abstract
Excess levels of protein in urine (proteinuria) is a hallmark of kidney disease that typically occurs 
in conjunction with diabetes, hypertension, gene mutations, toxins or infections but may also be of 
unknown cause (idiopathic)1. Systemic soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) 
is a circulating factor implicated in the onset and progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD)2, 
such as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS)3,4. The cellular source(s) of elevated suPAR 
associated with future and progressing kidney disease is unclear, but is likely extra-renal, as the

 pathological uPAR is circulating and FSGS can recur even after a damaged kidney is replaced with 
a healthy donor organ. Here we report that bone marrow (BM) Gr-1lo immature myeloid cells are 
responsible for the elevated, pathological levels of suPAR, as evidenced by BM chimera and BM 
ablation and cell transfer studies. A marked increase of Gr-1lo myeloid cells was commonly found 
in the BM of proteinuric animals having high suPAR, and these cells efficiently transmit 
proteinuria when transferred to healthy mice. In accordance with the results seen in suPAR-
associated proteinuric animal models, in which kidney damage is caused not by local podocyte-
selective injury but more likely by systemic insults, a humanized xenograft model of FSGS 
resulted in an expansion of Gr-1lo cells in the BM, leading to high plasma suPAR and proteinuric 
kidney disease. Together, these results identify suPAR as a functional connection between the BM 
and the kidney, and they implicate BM immature myeloid cells as a key contributor to glomerular 
dysfunction.
FSGS is a common primary glomerular disease leading to kidney failure, necessitating 
dialysis or kidney transplantation5. It is characterized morphologically by segmental 
sclerosis in some glomeruli; clinically, it is characterized by proteinuria6,7. About 80% of 
FSGS cases are primary or idiopathic. FSGS recurs in newly transplanted kidneys in 30% of 
adults and even more frequently in children8. Because of the rapid onset of FSGS recurrence 
after transplantation, circulating factors have been considered as pathogenic causes9–12. We 
previously reported that suPAR is one such circulating factor in FSGS, and we demonstrated 
that suPAR binds to and activates β3 integrin on the podocyte membrane. This leads to 
podocyte foot process effacement and disrupted glomerular barrier function, resulting in 
proteinuria3,4. Furthermore, as relatively high levels of suPAR associate with lower kidney 
function, prospective cohort studies in humans were subsequently performed: through these, 
suPAR has recently emerged as a risk factor for the incidence and progression of CKD2.
Circulating suPAR can be generated by release from the membrane-bound form of urokinase 
plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR), a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored 
three-domain (DI, DII and DIII) signaling protein13,14. suPAR exists in multiple forms due 
to alternative splicing, protein glycosylation and enzymatic cleavage of the mature protein15. 
While mounting experimental and clinical evidence suggests that suPAR is involved in the 
pathogenesis of CKD, the cellular source(s) of elevated suPAR remains unknown. Thus, 
identifying the cellular source(s) of suPAR that are relevant to kidney disease is one essential 
step required for the exploration of potential therapeutics aimed at the treatment of suPAR-
related renal dysfunction such as that seen in FSGS.
Experimental studies have shown that mice injected with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) as a 
model of glomerular injury display a transient proteinuria associated with podocyte foot 
process effacement3,4,16,17, as well as some renal lesions similar to FSGS in humans18. 
Based on our previous findings that uPAR deficiency protects against LPS-induced 
proteinuria and podocyte injury3,4, we first tested the contribution of hematopoietic cells on 
suPAR production and proteinuria development in the LPS model using a bone marrow 
transplantation (BMT) technique (Fig. 1a). We have successfully generated BM chimeric 
mice in which the recipient uPAR-deficient knockout (Plaur−/−, KO) mice were irradiated 
and reconstituted with BM cells of either uPAR wild-type (Plaur+/+, WT) or uPAR KO mice

 (Supplementary Fig. 1, WT→KO; 94.6% ± 3.7, KO→KO; 99.3% ± 0.7). As expected, 
KO→KO chimeric mice showed a strong defect in suPAR production (Fig. 1b,c) with a lack 
of proteinuria development (Fig. 1d) upon LPS stimulation. In contrast, the chimeric mice 
expressing uPAR selectively within hematopoietic cells (WT→KO) exhibited elevated 
suPAR levels in both blood and urine (Fig. 1b,c), as well as proteinuria (Fig. 1d), following 
LPS stimulation. These results suggest that hematopoietic cells are sufficient for the 
production of suPAR and the development of proteinuria in this model.
We further tested if the ablation of BM cells via irradiation could prevent suPAR-associated 
proteinuria following LPS treatment (Fig. 1e). Irradiation before LPS injection led to a 
marked reduction in the degree of proteinuria (Fig. 1f and Supplementary Fig. 2a,b) as well 
as in plasma suPAR levels (Fig. 1g) in BALB/c mice. However, when irradiated mice were 
reconstituted with unstimulated BM cells, they once again displayed proteinuria (Fig. 1f) 
with elevated plasma suPAR levels (Fig. 1g) upon LPS treatment.
Given that hematopoietic cells are categorized into lymphoid cells and myeloid (erythro-
myeloid) cells, we next examined which cell lineages participate in suPAR-associated 
proteinuria. This was accomplished by taking advantage of NOD-scid IL-2rγnull (NSG) 
mice, in which the white blood cell population is comprised of predominantly myeloid-
lineage cells due to the lack of mature lymphocytes: T cells, B cells and natural killer (NK) 
cells19. Despite impaired lymphoid populations, these NSG mice showed comparable levels 
of suPAR and proteinuria to BALB/c WT mice upon LPS administration (Fig. 1h–j). Based 
on these observations and previous findings16,17, we could rule out the contribution of 
mature lymphocytes on suPAR-associated proteinuria in this model and focus on cells of the 
myeloid lineage.
To define the nature of the myeloid cells in the LPS proteinuric mice, we studied the 
expressions of uPAR and of the mouse myeloid differentiation antigen Gr-1 in BM cells as 
well as in peripheral blood leukocytes. In LPS-treated animals, BM Gr-1+ myeloid cells—
but not peripheral blood Gr-1+ cells—exhibited elevated levels of uPAR on their membrane 
when compared to phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-treated mice (Fig. 2a). The surface 
expression of Gr-1 is representative of the maturation status of myeloid cells20. In the BM, 
the level of Gr-1 expression is low on myeloid progenitors or immature cells and increases 
as they mature to granulocytes. Of note, LPS stimulation led to a marked increase in the 
percentage of Gr-1lo cells in the BM of WT mice (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 3a,b). 
However, loss of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) receptor (G-CSFR), a 
major regulator of myelopoiesis21, resulted in impaired expansion of Gr-1lo BM myeloid 
cells upon LPS treatment (Fig. 2b) and, accordingly, in lower levels of proteinuria (Fig. 2c). 
We therefore hypothesized that the reactive expansion of immature myeloid cell populations 
in BM may contribute to the pathogenic kidney process. To test this, we used two conditions
—antibody-induced peripheral neutropenia and G-CSF treatment—as myeloid cell 
production can be stimulated either through feedback regulation in response to peripheral 
neutropenia or via direct supplementation with G-CSF. Injection of Ly6G-specific 
monoclonal antibody resulted in depletion of peripheral mature neutrophils (Supplementary 
Fig. 4a,b) and augmented the degree of proteinuria in LPS-challenged mice (Supplementary 
Fig. 4c). Similarly, G-CSF stimulated myelopoiesis (Supplementary Fig. 4d,e), accelerated

 proteinuria and elevated plasma suPAR levels as compared to LPS treatment alone 
(Supplementary Fig. 4f,g). Together, these data suggest that increased myelopoiesis 
amplifies suPAR-associated proteinuria in the LPS model.
Given the recent discovery of suPAR as a risk factor for CKD2, we reasoned that the 
expansion of Gr-1lo immature myeloid cells in the BM could be a common feature of 
suPAR-associated proteinuric kidney disease. We subsequently examined the levels of 
suPAR and Gr-1lo BM myeloid cells in additional animal models of proteinuria that included 
(i) TGF β1 Tg (transforming growth factor beta 1 transgenic), a mouse model that develops 
severe fibrosing kidney disease22,23, (ii) NTS (nephrotoxic serum nephritis), a rodent model 
of glomerulonephritis (GN)24, and (iii) BTBR ob/ob mice, a mouse model of diabetic 
nephropathy (DN)25. All tested animals exhibited proteinuria after their respective induction 
(Fig. 2d). Elevated suPAR levels were detected in the urine of TGF β1 Tg mice that typically 
have severe, nonselective proteinuria and in both blood and urine samples of NTS and DN 
models. These elevated suPAR levels were accompanied by an expansion in Gr-1lo BM 
myeloid cells (Fig. 2d) as seen in the LPS model.
Further testing with additional models of proteinuria shows a potential difference in the 
disease process between suPAR-mediated and suPAR-independent forms of disease. We 
tested blood and urine suPAR levels along with Gr-1lo cell populations in a genetic and a 
pharmacological model of podocyte injury. NEF-rtTA:Rac1 is a double transgenic mouse 
line where the expression of active Rac1 is induced in a podocyte-specific manner when 
animals are fed a diet that includes doxycycline (DOX) (hereafter referred as Pod-Rac1)26. 
Adriamycin (ADR) can induce nephropathy by causing toxin-mediated podocyte 
mitochondrial damage27. Unlike the suPAR-associated proteinuric models previously 
mentioned, the Pod-Rac1 (Fig. 2e) and ADR (Supplementary Fig. 5a) models, in which 
podocytes are the direct target of injury, did not exhibit elevated suPAR levels in the blood or 
urine (Fig. 2f,g and Supplementary Fig. 5b,c). Furthermore, there was no significant increase 
of the percentage of Gr-1lo myeloid cells in the BM (Fig. 2h and Supplementary Fig. 5d). 
Taken together, these results suggest that expansion of Gr-1lo BM myeloid cells could be a 
common upstream event that leads to systemic suPAR elevation, resulting in podocyte injury 
and proteinuria development in certain forms of kidney disease.
Next, we set out to test the therapeutic effect of BMT in suPAR-associated kidney 
dysfunction. NTS administration induced proteinuria and increased suPAR levels, reaching a 
peak at day 3 (Fig. 2i,j). However, the proteinuria following NTS injections was 
substantially ameliorated by irradiation and reconstitution with normal BM cells on day 2, 
and urinary suPAR levels were also reduced (Fig. 2i,j). BMT also ameliorated NTS-induced 
renal damage, including crescent formation and glomerular sclerosis (Supplementary Fig. 
6a,b). These results support the notion that BM plays an important role in suPAR-associated 
glomerular dysfunction, acting as an upstream regulatory system.
Our group4 and others28 (GenBank accession NM_011113, without GPI anchor) have 
previously reported that injection either of full-length suPAR into uPAR KO mice or of a 
shorter form of suPAR (GenBank accession BC010309) into WT mice leads to rapid 
proteinuria. Subsequent studies29,30 have shown that full-length suPAR injected into WT

 mice does not elicit a rapid proteinuric response unless combined with some other podocyte-
injurious molecule such as anti-CD40 autoantibody31. Given the recent insight that elevated 
suPAR predicts CKD several years before its onset, we tested the effect of chronic exposure 
of suPAR on podocyte injury by generating a novel transgenic mouse model (suPAR-Tg) 
that expresses mouse suPAR (full length: DIDIIDIII, without GPI anchor) under the control 
of the adipocyte protein 2 (aP2, also known as Fabp4) promoter. This model, in contrast to 
shorter timed suPAR exposure models29,30, allows for the analysis of long-term effects of 
high levels of suPAR (Supplementary Fig. 7a), as large amounts of suPAR can be generated 
from adipocytes of the transgenic mice fed a high-fat diet with a consequent release into the 
circulation (Supplementary Fig. 7a). At 16 weeks of age (and after being on a high-fat diet 
for the prior 8 weeks), suPAR-Tg mice exhibited a marked increase of suPAR expression in 
adipose tissues along with elevated plasma suPAR levels as compared to littermate controls 
(Supplementary Fig. 7b,c). Subsequently, these mice developed relatively mild but 
significant albuminuria (Supplementary Fig. 7d P = 0.016) with podocyte foot process 
effacement (Supplementary Fig. 7e), implying a disruption in kidney filter function.
Evidence continues to accumulate pointing to suPAR as being causative and not merely a 
biomarker for kidney disease4,28,31,32. Thus, we hypothesized that Gr-1lo BM myeloid cells 
harvested from proteinuric mice may be able to induce proteinuria when injected into 
healthy animals (Fig. 3a). To test this, BM cells isolated from PBS- or LPS-injected NSG 
mice were adoptively transferred into unchallenged NSG recipient mice. Indeed, transfer of 
LPS-challenged BM cells induced proteinuria in healthy recipient mice (Fig. 3a). Similarly, 
LPS-challenged WT C57BL/6 mouse BM cells were able to stimulate proteinuria (Fig. 3b 
and Supplementary Fig. 8a,b) and increase suPAR levels (Supplementary Fig. 8c,d) in 
recipient mice, whereas these effects were abrogated when Plaur−/− BM cells were 
transferred (Supplementary Fig. 8). However, the BM cells of Pod-Rac1 proteinuric mice did 
not cause proteinuria (Fig. 3b), suggesting that podocyte injury per se does not induce Gr-1lo 
BM myeloid cells to become kidney pathogenic; this interpretation is consistent with low 
systemic suPAR levels and low percentage of Gr-1lo myeloid cells in BM of Pod-Rac1 
proteinuric mice.
Since Gr-1lo myeloid cells in the BM are heterogeneous, we sought to determine which 
subsets of uPAR-expressing Gr-1lo cells are responsible for the development of proteinuria. 
Given that stem cell antigen-1 (Sca-1) is expressed on mouse hematopoietic stem/progenitor 
cells (HSPCs)33 and the expression is markedly enhanced by particularly primitive myeloid 
and granulopoietic progenitors during bacterial infection34, we examined Sca-1 expression 
in uPAR-expressing Gr-1lo BM cells. LPS stimulation increased a uPAR-expressing BM cell 
population (shown in blue in Fig. 3c) that is Sca-1loGr-1lo, suggesting that uPAR-expressing 
cells are myeloid-lineage-committed cells (defining immature myeloid cells) (Fig. 3c,d). To 
test whether the immature myeloid cells are capable of secreting suPAR, we studied suPAR 
secretion using in vitro BM cell culture under LPS stimulation (Fig. 3e). Consistent with the 
results from our in vivo studies, LPS stimulated the expansion of uPAR-expressing immature 
myeloid cells (Fig. 3f) as well as suPAR secretion (Fig. 3g) into the culture medium (CM) in 
a dose-dependent manner. To further evaluate if these cells can transfer disease when 
injected into healthy mice, Sca-1+ cells were depleted from LPS-challenged BM cells by 
magnetic separation before transfer into NSG mice (Fig. 3h and Supplementary Fig. 9). The

 removal of Sca-1+ BM cells lowered both proteinuria (Fig. 3i) and suPAR levels (Fig. 3j,k) 
when compared with that in non-depleted control BM cells. These results emphasize the 
primary role of BM immature myeloid cells in the regulation of suPAR production and 
proteinuria development.
In an effort to translate our findings to human disease, we used a humanized mouse 
approach35–37. A model commonly used is the immunodeficient mouse engrafted with 
human hematopoietic cells, such as peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) or 
hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs). A previous report38 demonstrated that transfer 
of CD34+ HSPCs from individuals with glomerular diseases into healthy mice can induce 
albuminuria, but offered no mechanism. Thus, we hypothesized that human CD34+ cells 
isolated from individuals with recurrent FSGS might induce proteinuria via suPAR-driven 
podocyte injury. To test this hypothesis, we introduced whole PBMCs or PBMCs depleted of 
CD34+ cells (CD34Δ PBMCs) derived either from individuals with recurrent FSGS or from 
healthy individuals into the NSG mice (Fig. 4a). Engraftment rate of human cells was 
determined by the percentage of human CD45+ cells in the blood and BM of the recipient 
xenograft animals (Supplementary Fig. 10a). Mice receiving patient whole PBMCs, but not 
CD34Δ PBMCs, developed proteinuria (Fig. 4b) in association with high mouse suPAR 
levels in both blood and urine (Fig. 4c,d). These mice also had a higher percentage of Gr-1lo 
population in BM (Fig. 4e), similar to what we observed in the suPAR-associated proteinuric 
animal models. This disease phenotype was prevented by depleting CD34+ cells from the 
samples of individuals with FSGS (Fig. 4b–e). Proteinuria in mice receiving patient whole 
PBMCs was accompanied by mild glomerular sclerosis (Supplementary Fig. 10b) and 
podocyte foot process effacement (Fig. 4f). These mice also exhibited elevated blood urea 
nitrogen (BUN) levels, increased kidney weight and enlarged, loosely structured glomeruli 
(Supplementary Fig. 10c–e) reminiscent of human FSGS. It is unlikely that the observed 
impairment in kidney function was due to graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) since PBMCs 
from the healthy individuals, as well as those depleted of CD34+ cells derived from 
individuals with recurrent FSGS, did not cause kidney injury. In contrast, using a mouse 
model of GVHD, we observed both weight loss and a mortality rate of 80% within 3 weeks 
in the mice receiving allogeneic BM cells (Supplementary Fig. 11a,b). The xenograft mice 
did not exhibit body weight loss (Supplementary Fig. 12a). Moreover, only negligible 
glomerular deposits of human IgGs were observed (Supplementary Fig. 12b), as well as very 
mild lymphocyte infiltration in the skin and liver of the xenograft mice (Supplementary Fig. 
12c). Since GVHD is mainly caused by donor T cells, we repeated the xenograft experiment 
with PBMCs depleted of T cells to avoid the risk of GVHD in the xenograft model. 
Consistently, we found that T-cell-depleted PBMCs from individuals with recurrent FSGS 
were sufficient to induce proteinuria and increase suPAR levels in mice (Fig. 4g–i). Taken 
together, these data suggest that engraftment of CD34+ cells derived from individuals with 
recurrent FSGS into NSG mice caused expansion of Gr-1lo BM myeloid cells, leading to 
suPAR-associated podocyte injury that results in proteinuria.
Here we demonstrate that BM myeloid lineage cells that are Gr-1lo and Sca-1lo are a 
common source for the overproduction of suPAR that fuels the development of proteinuric 
kidney disease. The systemic models (LPS, TGF β1-Tg, NTS and DN) and the xenograft 
mouse model of human FSGS converge at the expansion of uPAR-expressing immature

 myeloid cells in BM and high suPAR levels, unlike podocyte selective injury models (Pod-
Rac1 and ADR) (Fig. 4j). Given that bacterial infection induces massive myeloid cell 
production in BM, it seems that the LPS model is a preferentially immune-related model as 
compared to other models tested. Indeed, the LPS model showed the highest percentage of 
Gr-1lo BM myeloid cells among the suPAR-associated proteinuric animal models. The 
pathogenesis of these other models may be undoubtedly more complex and heterogeneous, 
resulting in differing disease states and/or severity. In addition, transfer of these pathogenic 
myeloid cells was sufficient to cause proteinuria in healthy mice. Consistently, BMT 
substantially reduced suPAR levels and subsequently improved kidney function in 
proteinuric mice. In this study, we expand the role of BM from being merely a place for 
hematopoietic cell production to also being a key regulator of kidney function by expanding 
suPAR-generating cells. The expansion of suPAR-expressing immature myeloid cells could 
be a common upstream event that leads to suPAR-associated kidney injury seen in FSGS and 
possibly relevant to other proteinuric kidney diseases. Given the observation of increased 
Gr-1lo BM cells in animal models of primary and secondary forms of glomerular disease, 
this finding may represent a dogma change, and this discovery may also shift the focus away 
from the kidney to common upstream regulatory systems with broad relevance to general 
forms of CKD. In accordance with the notion of a very upstream mediator of kidney disease, 
suPAR levels predicted incidence of CKD in people many years ahead of the onset of 
symptoms or the diagnosis of disease2.
Although we have identified uPAR-expressing BM immature myeloid cells (Sca-1loGr-1lo) 
as cellular sources of suPAR responsible for damaging kidney podocytes in mice, the 
equivalent type of cell subset in humans remains to be determined and is not immediately 
identifiable given the lack of human homologs for Gr-1 or Sca-1. Thus, the identification of 
cellular sources of suPAR in patients followed by a relevant therapeutic regimen for proper 
modification could be the basis for a novel treatment of proteinuric kidney diseases that are 
characterized by high suPAR levels.
We engineered a xenograft mouse model of FSGS and further revealed that CD34+ HSPCs 
derived from individuals with recurrent FSGS are critical for development of a suPAR-
associated glomerulopathy in mice. This was surprising given the rarity of CD34+ cells 
among PBMCs: a frequency of only 0.05–0.2%. However, the mechanism by which CD34+ 
cells from individuals with FSGS expand the murine myeloid cells remains elusive. 
According to our observations, it seems that CD34+ cells from people with suPAR-
associated kidney disease are functionally different from those from healthy individuals, and 
these HSPCs carry and transfer information on disease pathogenesis. Similarly, Gr-1lo BM 
myeloid cells generated in the systemic inflammatory models such as the LPS model 
increased suPAR levels and caused proteinuria, whereas Gr-1lo BM myeloid cells produced 
by normal myelopoiesis did not. Supporting our hypothesis, it has been shown that HSPCs 
are significantly expanded and functionally altered in lupus model mice, with skewing 
toward myeloid cell production39. It has also been shown that undifferentiated HSPCs 
produce a wide range of cytokines upon stimulation and these cells are significantly more 
potent cytokine secretors than are mature immune cells40. It will be of interest to further 
investigate whether CD34+ cells from individuals with FSGS produce distinct cytokines that

 are capable of stimulating the mouse hematopoietic system to become pathogenic, leading to 
an increase of suPAR and induce proteinuria.
In conclusion, this study further demonstrates a direct pathogenic role of suPAR as a 
circulating mediator of kidney disease, such as FSGS. Given its specific cellular source, 
suPAR-associated renal diseases may originate as a primary hematopoietic stem cell 
disorder, providing novel functions for BM in extrarenal regulation of the glomerular 
filtration barrier. In addition, our findings serve as a prototype for the pathogenesis of other 
diseases in which BM progenitors may regulate organ function via soluble mediators 
presently categorized as ‘idiopathic’. Stem cell transplantation may prove to be a viable 
approach to treat diseases such as suPAR-associated kidney disease.

(NSG) mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). The Plaur−/− 
mice were originally on a mixed background of 75% C57BL/6 and 25% 129, but 
backcrossed to C57BL/6 mice for more than ten generations before use. EGFP_CA-Rac1

(Washington University School of Medicine, Missouri)26. Albumin TGF β1 transgenic and 
littermate mice were kindly provided by M. Bitzer (University of Michigan)22. Animal 
experiments were carried out according to the National Institutes of Health Guide for Care 
and Use of Experimental Animals and approved by the Rush University Institutional Animal 
Care and Use Committee (IACUC). All groups of mice were age- and sex-matched. The 
numbers of animals used in each experiment are described in the figure legends. Five 
experimental animal models of proteinuria were used in this study. i) LPS injected mice: 
Proteinuria was induced with a single injection of LPS as described previously3,4. Briefly, 
10- to 12-week-old female and male C57BL/6 mice were injected with LPS (Sigma, L3129) 
intraperitoneally (i.p.) at a dose of 10 mg per kg body weight. PBS injected mice were used 
as a control. 24 h after LPS treatment, urine and blood samples were collected and kidney, 
femurs and tibias were harvested from killed mice. ii) Pod-Rac1, inducible EGFP_CA-Rac1 
transgenic mice: EGFP_CA-Rac1 transgenic mice were crossed to Nphs1-rtTA (NEF-rtTA) 
inducer mice to generate double transgenic (dTG, NEF × Rac1) mice. Male mice were used 
in this study. To induce transgene expression, regular chow was replaced with doxycycline 
(DOX)-supplemented chow (2,000 ppm; TestDiet). Single transgenic (EGFP_CA-Rac1) 
mice were used as a control. 12 d after DOX administered diet, urine and blood samples 
were collected and kidney, femurs and tibias were harvested from killed mice. iii) 
Adriamycin (ADR) injected mice: Proteinuria was induced with a single injection of ADR 
as described previously40. Briefly, male BALB/c mice aged 10–12 weeks were injected with

 ADR (Doxorubicin Hydrochloride, Sigma, D1515) via the tail vein at a dose of 11 mg per 
kg body weight. 6 d after ADR injection, urine and blood samples were collected and 
kidney, femurs and tibias were harvested from killed mice. iv) TGF β1 transgenic mice: 
transgenic mice expressing an active form of TGF β1 under the control of the murine 
albumin promoter developed proteinuria as described previously22. Since the transgene is on 
the Y chromosome, only male mice (aged <4 weeks) with a severe phenotype were used. 
Littermate female mice were used as a control. v) Nephrotoxic serum (NTS) nephritis 
model: Proteinuria was induced by injection of NTS as described previously24. Briefly, male 
C57BL/6 mice aged 8 weeks were injected i.p with sheep anti-rabbit-glomerular basement 
membrane antibody at a dose of 500 mg per kg body weight on consecutive days. PBS 
injected mice were used as a control. 7 d after injection, urine and blood samples were 
collected and kidney, femurs and tibias were harvested from killed mice. vi) BTBR ob/ob 
diabetic nephropathy (DN) model: the mouse strain BTBR with the ob/ob leptin-deficiency 
mutation developed severe type 2 diabetes with heavy proteinuria as described previously25. 
Wild-type (BTBR ob+/+), heterozygous (BTBR ob+/−) and homozygous (BTBR ob−/−) mice 
were obtained by mating heterozygous (BTBR ob+/−) mice. For the DN model, male and 
female homozygotes aged 16 weeks (BTBR ob−/−) were used. Wild-type (BTBR ob+/+) or 
heterozygote (BTBR ob+/−) littermates were used as controls.
Generation of BM chimeric mice
We used female uPAR KO mice aged 10–12 weeks as recipients. uPAR KO (CD45.2) mice 
were irradiated with a dose of 9.5 Gy using Gammacell 40 and reconstituted via retro-orbital 
injection with 1 × 107 BM cells of either uPAR WT (B6.SJL, CD45.1) or uPAR KO 
(CD45.2) mice. Mice were administered antibiotic-treated water and used for experiments at 
6 weeks after BM transplantation. Engraftment of the donor cells was evaluated by flow 
cytometric analysis of peripheral blood leukocytes stained with fluorescence-conjugated 
antibodies against CD45.1 (eBioscience, 12-0453) and CD45.2 (eBioscience, 11-0454).
Detection of circulating and urinary suPAR levels
Mouse suPAR levels from plasma (and/or serum) and urine were evaluated by enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (R&D systems, DY531) following the 
manufacturer’s protocol.
Albumin creatinine ratio (ACR) measurement
Mouse urine samples were collected and urinary albumin and creatinine were measured by 
mouse albumin ELISA (Bethyl Labs, E99-134), and creatinine assay (Cayman Chemical, 
500701) kits according to manufacturers’ protocols. The ratio of urinary albumin to 
creatinine was then calculated.
Purification of mouse PBLs and BMCs
To collect blood, mice were anesthetized, then the blood was drawn from posterior vena 
cava into acid-citrate-dextrose (ACD, Sigma, C3821) solution-containing 1 ml syringe. After 
lysis of red blood cells (RBCs), blood leukocytes were washed and counted. For BMCs 
purification, femurs and tibias were taken from killed mice and flushed with a syringe filled

 with Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS, Life Technologies, 14170112) containing 0.1% 
bovine serum albumin and 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.4). Following RBC lysis, the BM cell 
suspensions were filtered through a 40 μm cell strainer (Falcon).
Adoptive transfer of BMCs
To explore the role of BMCs in production of suPAR in proteinuric mice, female BALB/c 
mice aged 10–12 weeks were lethally irradiated with 9.5 Gy using Gammacell 40. On the 
next day, these mice received syngeneic donor BMCs, which were labeled with Calcein-AM 
(Molecular Probes, C3100MP), via the retro-orbital route (5 × 106 cells per mouse). To 
induce proteinuria, LPS was injected into the recipient mice 1 h after transfer of BMCs. 24 h 
after LPS treatment, urine and blood samples were collected and kidney, femurs and tibias 
were harvested from the killed mice.
Flow cytometric analysis
Isolated peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) or BMCs were resuspended with PBS and 
single cell suspensions were first incubated with rat anti-mouse CD16/CD32 (eBioscience, 
14-0161) at 5 μg/ml for 30 min on ice to block Fc receptors. The cells were then labeled for 
30 min on ice with fluorescence-conjugated antibodies at 2 μg/ml: Gr-1-Alexa Fluor 647 
(BioLegend, 108418), uPAR-phycoerythrin (PE) (R&D Systems, FAB531P), Sca-1- 
fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) (eBioscience, 11-5981), c-kit-allophycocyanin (APC) 
(eBioscience, 17-1171) and irrelevant IgG isotype control anti-bodies. Data acquisition and 
analysis were performed on an Accuri C6 flow cytometer (BD Biosciences).
In vivo depletion
Anti-Ly6G monoclonal antibody (1A8, BioXcell) or control rat IgG2a antibody (2A3, 
BioXcell) was injected i.p. into female BALB/c mice aged 10–12 weeks (500 μg per mouse) 
48 h and 1 h before LPS injection. Neutrophil depletion was confirmed by flow cytometric 
analysis.
Treatment with granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF)
Recombinant mouse G-CSF (Shenandoah Biotechology, 200-14) was administrated by daily 
i.p. injection into BALB/c mice (female, aged 10–12 weeks) at a dose of 4 μg per 20 g body 
weight for two consecutive days. Blood cell counts were determined using a Hemavet 950FS 
(Drew Scientific).
Intervention study (NTS model)
Male C57BL/6 mice aged 8 weeks were injected i.p with NTS (250 mg per kg body weight) 
for two consecutive days (day 0 and day 1). The next day (day 2), proteinuric animals were 
divided into two groups having an equal ACR mean level; one group was irradiated (9.5 Gy) 
and received BM cells (1 × 107 in 100 μl PBS, retro-orbital injection) collected from naive 
male C57BL/6 mice as a treatment group (NTS + BMT). The other group received PBS (100 
μl, retro-orbital injection) as a control (NTS + vehicle). Urine and blood samples were 
collected and proteinuria and serum suPAR levels were evaluated before and after BMT 
treatment.

 Generation of suPAR transgenic mice
We generated a suPAR transgenic mouse (suPAR-Tg) model overexpressing the soluble 
form of mouse full-length suPAR (corresponding to NP_035243, DIDIIDIII without GPI 
anchor) in adipose tissue using the adipocyte fatty acid binding protein (AP2) promoter. The 
suPAR transgene (DIDIIDIII) is secreted into the circulation owing to the absence of a cell-
tethering GPI anchor. Non-transgenic (non-Tg) littermate mice were used as a control. To 
enhance suPAR production, regular rodent diet was replaced by high fat food when the mice 
were aged at least 2 months, and the animals were kept on the high fat diet for 8 weeks. Both 
suPAR-Tg and non-Tg control animals showed comparable body weight. After 8 weeks of 
high fat diet feeding, urine and blood samples were collected and kidney and visceral fat 
tissues were harvested from the killed mice. Adipose-tissue-specific expression of the 
suPAR transgene was confirmed by performing ELISA using lysates of visceral fat tissues of 
the suPAR-Tg and non-Tg littermate controls.
BM cell transfer from proteinuric animal models into NSG mice
To evaluate if Gr-1lo BM myeloid cells from mice with proteinuria are able to induce 
proteinuria, the BM cells were isolated from different proteinuric animal models, then 
transferred into 10- to 12-week-old female NSG mice. 12 h following transfer of donor BM 
cells, ACR was measured from the urine samples of the recipient mice. To test the ability of 
BM cells to develop proteinuria directly, donor (WT or Plaur−/−) mice were injected with 
LPS, 24 h later, BM cells were isolated and transferred into NSG recipient mice (female, 
aged 10–12 weeks). ACR and suPAR levels were monitored in a time course as indicated in 
the relevant figure. To determine if Sca-1+ cells are required for suPAR-associated 
proteinuria, BM cells were isolated from LPS-challenged C57BL/6 WT mice (female, aged 
10–12 weeks) and divided into 2 groups, whole BM cells and Sca-1+ cell depleted BM cells. 
These two groups of cells were then transferred into female NSG mice aged 10–12 weeks. 
ACR and suPAR levels were monitored over time.
In vitro LPS stimulation on isolated BM cells
The BM cells were isolated from C57BL/6 WT mice (female, aged 10–12 weeks) and 
treated with PBS or various concentrations of LPS (0.1, 1, and 10 μg/ml). Following 24-h 
incubation at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator (5%), the cells and culture supernatants were 
collected. The cells were stained for uPAR, Sca-1 and Gr-1. The in vitro induction of 
uPAR+Sca-1loGr-1lo cells in total BM cells was determined by triple color-flow cytometric 
analysis. The culture supernatants were used for suPAR measurement.
Cell depletion methods
To study adoptive transfer of Sca-1+ cell depleted BMCs, Sca-1+ cells were removed from 
whole BMCs using EasySep mouse cell isolation kits (Stemcell technologies, 18556). In 
brief, LPS-challenged WT BM cells were isolated and labeled with biotinylated anti-mouse 
Sca-1 antibody and then incubated with streptavidin-magnetic micro beads. By collecting 
unbound cells in the magnetic field, Sca-1+ cell-depleted BM cells were prepared. For the 
humanization study, human CD34+ or CD3+ cells were depleted from PBMCs obtained from 
individuals with recurrent FSGS and healthy donors, using EasySep human CD34 positive

 selection kit (Stemcell technologies, 18056) or EasySep human CD3 positive selection kit II 
(Stemcell technologies, 17851).
Human subjects
Peripheral blood was drawn from healthy volunteers and individuals with recurrent FSGS in 
accordance with guidelines on human research and approval of the Institutional Review 
Board of Rush University Medical Center. Informed consent was obtained from the blood 
donors. All individuals with recurrent FSGS participated in this study have undergone 
kidney transplantation and shown a recurrence in the allograft.
Engraftment of human PBMCs into NSG mice
PBMCs were isolated from peripheral blood of healthy volunteers and individuals with 
recurrent FSGS by standard ficoll separation. The purified PBMCs were transferred via i.p. 
injection into female NSG mice aged 6–8 weeks (5 × 106 cells per mouse) on day 0. The 
engrafted mice were monitored overtime for the development of FSGS-like phenotypes by 
monitoring proteinuria and high suPAR levels in the blood and urine, respectively. We used 
freshly isolated PBMCs for transfer as the freeze-thawed PBMCs showed poor engraftment 
in our experimental settings. For measurement of reconstitution rates of human cells, 
peripheral blood was drawn from the mice 10–12 weeks post engraftment and blood 
leukocytes were stained with fluorescence-labeled antibodies against human CD45 
(Beckman Coulter, IM2473U) and mouse CD45 (BD Pharmingen, 553081). Following RBC 
lysis, the cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. To rule out the risk of GVHD, donor T 
cells were removed from PBMCs before engraftment. In brief, human CD3+ cells were 
depleted from PBMCs obtained from individuals with FSGS and healthy donors. The T-cell 
depleted PBMCs were injected via i.p into female NSG mice aged 8 weeks (3.5 × 106 cells 
per mouse) on day 0. ACR and suPAR levels were measured at 16 weeks post-engraftment.
Histology
Kidneys were dissected from the xenograft mice and NTS injected animals (NTS and NTS + 
BMT). Renal tissues were fixed overnight in formalin and embedded in paraffin. The 
sections were cut at 3- to 4-μm thickness and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) or 
periodic acid–Schiff (PAS). Glomerular crescent formation and sclerosis was evaluated in a 
blinded fashion on PAS-stained paraffin sections and scored using a semiquantitative scale 
(0–3), in which 0 represented no abnormalities, and 1, 2 and 3 represented mild, moderate 
and severe abnormalities, respectively. Ten glomeruli were assessed for each animal (n = 3 
per group).
Electron microscopy
Following dissection, mouse kidneys were cut down to 23–33 mm pieces. For scanning 
electron microscopy (SEM), tissues were fixed in Trumps Fixative (Electron Microscopy 
Sciences, 11750), dehydrated with graded ethanol, dried using a 850 Critical Point Dryer 
(Electron Microscopy Sciences) and gold coated on a Cressington 108 Auto Sputter Coater 
(Ted Pella). For transmission electron microscopy (TEM), renal tissues were fixed and 
processed as described above then post fixed in 1% OsO4 for 1 h on ice. Tissues were

 washed, dehydrated and embedded in Epon812 (Electron Microscopy Sciences). Ultrathin 
kidney sections (70 nm) were obtained using an EM UC7 Ultramicrotome (Leica) and 
collected on Formvar coated Ni slot grids (Electron Microscopy Sciences, FF-2010-Ni) then 
stained in 5% uranyl acetate and 0.1% lead citrate. Digital micrographs were taken using a 
Sigma HDVP Electron Microscope (Zeiss).
Immunofluorescence
Frozen kidney tissues of the xenograft mice were cut at 4 μm thickness and fixed with ice-
cold acetone for 5 min. After blocking with blocking solution (2.5% donkey normal serum 
and 2.5% FBS (FBS) in PBS) for 1 h, samples were stained with goat anti-mouse 
synaptopodin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-21537) diluted at 1:300 with blocking solution, 
followed by Alexa Fluor 546-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG (Molecular Probes, A11057) 
diluted at 1:1,000 with blocking solution. After washing, the samples were further incubated 
with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 
109-545-006) diluted at 1:300 with blocking solution. After washing, stained samples were 
mounted with ProLong Gold antifade reagent with DAPI (Molecular Probes, P36935). 
Images were obtained and analyzed using a Carl Zeiss LSM 700 confocal microscope.
A mouse model of MHC mismatched GVHD
BALB/c recipients (female, aged 10–12 weeks) were lethally irradiated (9.5 Gy) and 
received 107 BM cells and 5 × 106 spleen cells from C57BL/6 donors (MHC mismatched 
allogeneic transplant) via retro-orbital injection. As a control (syngeneic transplant), 
irradiated BALB/c recipients received BM cells and spleen cells from BALB/c donors. Mice 
were monitored for body weight and mortality.
Statistical analysis
Data are shown as mean ± s.d. or ± s.e.m. Statistical analysis was assessed using GraphPad 
Prism 5.0 (⋆P < 0.05, ⋆⋆P < 0.01, ⋆⋆⋆P < 0.001). Significance of the difference between two 
groups was assessed using the Student’s unpaired two-tailed t test. For multiple group 
comparisons, we performed one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison test. No 
statistical method was used to predetermine sample size in animal studies. Sample sizes 
were estimated on the basis of sample availability and previous experimental studies3,4,22–27. 
No samples or animals were excluded from the analyses. Animals were allocated at random 
to treatment groups. Investigators were not blinded during animal experiments.

 percentages of Gr-1lo cells in BM from three different animal models of proteinuria: (i) TGF 
β1-Tg mice (n = 5 per group), (ii) NTS-injected mice (n = 5 per group), and (iii) BTBR 
ob/ob DN mice (n = 4 per group). Their relevant controls were used as described in the 
Online Methods. Data are shown as mean ± s.e.m.; unpaired two-tailed Student t-test, *P < 
0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, NS, not significant. (e–h) Examination of proteinuria (e), 
suPAR levels in the serum (f) and urine (g) and the percentages of Gr-1lo cells in BM (h) of 
LPS injected and Pod-Rac1 transgenic mice. Their relevant controls were used as described 
in the Online Methods. In e n = 10 for PBS, n = 16 for LPS, n = 5 for control+DOX, n = 7 
for Pod-Rac1+DOX); in f n = 6 for PBS, n = 11 for LPS, n = 4 for control+DOX, n = 5 for 
Pod-Rac1+DOX; in g n = 8 for PBS, n = 8 for LPS, n = 4 for control+DOX, n = 5 for Pod-
Rac1+DOX; in h n = 5 per group. Data are shown as mean ± s.e.m.; unpaired two-tailed 
Student t-test, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, NS, not significant. (i,j) Proteinuria (i) and urinary 
suPAR levels (j) in the NTS-injected C57BL/6 mice receiving PBS (NTS + vehicle, n = 3) 
or BMT (NTS + BMT, n = 3). Data are shown as mean ± s.e.m.; unpaired two-tailed Student 
t-test, *P < 0.05.

BM immature myeloid cells have an ability to transfer disease. (a) Examination of 
proteinuria in recipient NSG mice before (0) and 6, 12, and 24 h after adoptive transfer of 
BM cells obtained from PBS- or LPS-injected NSG mice. The results are from two 
independent experiments (n = 4 for PBS-BMCs; n = 7 for LPS-BMCs). Data are shown as 
mean ± s.e.m.; unpaired two-tailed Student t-test, *P < 0.05. (b) Examination of proteinuria 
in recipient NSG mice 12 h following adoptive transfer of BM cells obtained from LPS-
challenged C57BL/6 WT and Pod-Rac1 mice. n = 5 per group. Data are shown as mean ± 
s.e.m. One-way ANOVA, Tukey’s multiple comparison test, **P < 0.01, NS, not significant. 
(c) Representative dot plots (chosen from a total of three generated) of triple-color stained 
(uPAR/Sca-1/Gr-1) total BM cells (red) isolated from PBS- or LPS-injected C57BL/6 mice 
(n = 3 per group). uPAR+ cells (blue) were gated and shown in these dot plots. (d) 
Quantitation for uPAR-expressing immature myeloid cells (uPAR+Sca-1loGr-1lo) cells 
shown in c (n = 3 per group). Data are shown as mean ± s.e.m.; unpaired two-tailed Student 
t-test, ***P < 0.001. (e–g) In vitro culture of total BM cells isolated from C57BL/6 WT 
mice with PBS or various concentrations of LPS (0.1, 1, and 10 μg/ml). (e) Experimental 
scheme. (f) In vitro induction of uPAR+Sca-1loGr-1lo cells determined by triple color-flow 
cytometric analysis. (g) suPAR secretion into culture medium (CM) measured by suPAR 
ELISA. Data are shown as mean ± s.e.m. One-way ANOVA, Tukey’s multiple comparison 
test, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001. (h) Schematic diagram outlining the experimental 
design of the BM cell transfer used in i–k. (i–k) Examination of proteinuria (i), serum (j) 
and urinary suPAR levels (k) in recipient NSG mice before (0) and 6, 12, and 24 h after 
adoptive transfer of either whole BM cells or Sca-1+ cell-depleted (Sca-1Δ) BM cells of 
LPS-challenged C57BL/6 WT mice. The results are from three independent experiments (n 
= 9 for whole BMCs; n = 8 for Sca-1ΔBMCs). Data are shown as mean ± s.e.m.; unpaired 
two-tailed Student t-test, *P < 0.05.

hFSGS CD34+ cells induce suPAR-associated proteinuria in mice. (a) Schematic diagram 
outlining the studies of humanized mice. rFSGS, recurrent FSGS. (b–e) Proteinuria (b), 
mouse suPAR levels in plasma (c) and in urine (d), percentages of Gr-1lo cells in BM (e) of 
the xenograft mice after 10–12 weeks post-engraftment. The results are from two 
independent experiments. In b–d, n = 4 per group, except n = 5 for healthy whole PBMCs; 
in e, n = 3 per group. Data are shown as mean ± s.e.m. One-way ANOVA, followed up by 
Tukey′s multiple comparison test, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001. (f) Transmission 
and scanning electron microscope (TEM, 10,000×, and SEM, 15,000×) analysis of kidney 
glomeruli of the xenograft mice. TEM images displaying podocyte foot processes were 
enlarged and highlighted. SEM images show a podocyte cell body, primary processes and 
interdigitating foot processes. Scale bars, 2 μm. (g–i) T-cell-depleted PBMCs of individuals 
with recurrent FSGS or healthy donors were injected into NSG mice. Proteinuria (g), mouse 
suPAR levels in plasma (h) and in urine (i) of the xenograft mice after 16 weeks post-
engraftment (n = 4 per group). Data are shown as mean ± s.e.m. Student’s t-test, *P < 0.05, 
**P < 0.01. (j) Model depicting a role for Gr-1lo BM immature myeloid cells in suPAR-
driven podocyte injury and proteinuria. Systemic immunological proteinuric models—LPS, 
hFSGS xenograft, TGF β1 transgenic (fibrosing nephrotic syndrome), NTS (serum 
nephritis) and BTBR ob/ob (diabetic nephropathy)—converge at the expansion of Gr-1lo 
cells in BM and high blood suPAR levels.
