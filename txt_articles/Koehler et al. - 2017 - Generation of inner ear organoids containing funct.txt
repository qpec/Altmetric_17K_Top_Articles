Abstract
Human inner ear tissue derived from pluripotent stem cells could provide a powerful platform for 
drug discovery or a source of sound- or motion-sensing cells for patients with hearing loss or 
balance dysfunction. Here we report a method for differentiating human pluripotent stem cells to 
inner ear organoids that harbor functional hair cells. Using a three-dimensional culture system, we 
modulate TGF, BMP, FGF, and Wnt signaling to generate multiple otic vesicle–like structures 
from a single stem-cell aggregate. Over two months, the vesicles develop into inner ear organoids 
with sensory epithelia that are innervated by sensory neurons. Additionally, using CRISPR/Cas9, 
we generate an ATOH1-2A-eGFP cell line to detect hair cell induction and demonstrate that 
derived hair cells exhibit electrophysiological properties similar to those of native sensory hair 
cells. Our culture system will be useful for elucidating mechanisms of human inner ear 
development and testing potential inner ear therapies.
The human inner ear contains ∼75,000 sensory hair cells that detect sound and movement 
via mechanosensitive stereocilia bundles1,2. Genetic mutations or environmental insults, 
such as loud noises and ototoxic drugs, can cause irreparable damage to these hair cells,

 leading to hearing loss or dizziness3,4. We previously demonstrated how to generate inner 
ear organoids from mouse pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) using timed manipulation of the 
TGFβ, BMP, FGF and Wnt signaling pathways in a 3D culture system5,6. We have shown 
that mouse inner ear organoids contain sensory hair cells that are structurally and 
functionally similar to native vestibular hair cells in the mouse inner ear7. Moreover, our past 
findings supported a working model of otic induction signaling cascades in which BMP 
signaling activation and TGFβ inhibition initially specify non-neural ectoderm, and 
subsequent BMP inhibition and FGF activation induce a pre-otic fate8,9. Despite several 
recent attempts, a developmentally faithful approach for deriving functional hair cells from 
human PSCs (hPSCs) has yet to be described10-15. Here, to generate human inner ear tissue 
from hPSCs, we first established a timeline of in vitro human inner ear organogenesis (Fig. 
1a, b). The inner ear arises from the ectoderm layer and, in humans, produces the first 
terminally differentiated hair cells by ∼52 days post conception (dpc)16. Beginning with 
pluripotent cells in the epiblast, inner ear induction begins at ∼12 dpc with formation of the 
ectoderm epithelium. Then, the epithelium splits into the non-neural ectoderm (also known 
as surface ectoderm) and the neuroectoderm (Fig. 1a, b). The non-neural ectoderm 
ultimately produces the inner ear as well as the epidermis of the skin. Thus, in our initial 
experiments, we sought to establish a chemically defined 3D culture system for targeted 
derivation of non-neural ectoderm epithelia, from which we could derive inner ear organoids 
(Fig. 1a-c).
We first confirmed that dissociated human embryonic stem cells (hESCs; WA25 cell line, 
WiCell) aggregate well in E8 Medium containing a ROCK inhibitor, Y-27632, and display 
superior uniformity and cell-survival compared to cells aggregated in a chemically defined 
differentiation medium (hereafter, CDM; Supplementary Fig. 1 and Table 1). Following a 2-
day incubation in E8 Medium, we transferred aggregates to CDM containing a low 
concentration of Matrigel and FGF-2 to stimulate epithelization and ectoderm differentiation 
on the aggregate surface. We previously showed that a combination of BMP4 and the TGFβ 
inhibitor SB-431542 (hereafter, SB) can promote non-neural induction from mouse PSCs 
(mPSCs)6. We found that combining 10 ng/ml BMP4 and 10 μM SB (dual SB/BMP4 
treatment referred to as SBB) induces not only non-neural marker genes, such as TFAP2A 
and DLX3, but also the extraembryonic marker CDX2 (Fig 1d; Supplementary Fig. 2)17. In 
contrast, SB treatment alone led to an increase in TFAP2A and DLX3 expression with no 
corresponding CDX2 expression (Fig. 1d). 100% of SB-treated aggregates generated 
TFAP2A+ E-cadherin (ECAD)+ epithelium with a surface ectoderm–like morphology by 
days 4-6 of differentiation—a time scale consistent with human embryogenesis (n = 15 
aggregates, 3 experiments; Fig. 1b-e; Supplementary Fig. 2). Over a period of 20 days, the 
epithelium expanded into a cyst composed of TFAP2A+ Keratin-5 (KRT5)+ keratinocyte-
like cells (Supplementary Fig. 3). From these findings, we concluded that treating WA25 cell 
aggregates with SB is sufficient to induce a non-neural epithelium.
To determine whether endogenous BMP activity is sufficient for non-neural specification, 
we performed a co-treatment with the BMP inhibitor LDN-193189 (hereafter, LDN; dual 
LDN/SB treatment referred to as LSB). As previously shown in hESC monolayer cultures18, 
LSB treatment of WA25 aggregates up-regulated neuroectoderm markers, such as PAX6 and 
N-cadherin (NCAD), and abolished TFAP2A and ECAD expression, suggesting that

 endogenous BMP signals drive non-neural conversion (Fig. 1f; Supplementary Fig. 4). To 
further validate our approach, we treated human iPSCs (mND2-0, WiCell) with SB and 
found, contrary to our results with WA25 hESCs, that SB-only conditions generated PAX6+ 
neuroectoderm and TFAP2A+ ECAD- neural crest-like cells (Supplementary Fig. 5). We 
reasoned that variation in endogenous BMP levels may underlie the different outcomes, and 
the BMP concentration may have to be fine-tuned for each cell line. Accordingly, a low 
concentration of BMP4 (2.5 ng/ml) in addition to SB (SBB) resulted in generation of 
TFAP2A+ ECAD+ non-neural epithelium from mND2-0 iPSCs (Fig. 1g; Supplementary Fig. 
5). With either the SB or SBB approaches, the resulting epithelia closely resembled non-
neural epithelia generated with mPSCs5,6. In contrast to our mouse culture, non-neural 
conversion occurs without off-target induction of Brachyury (BRA)+ mesendoderm cells 
(Supplementary Fig. 6). The following data were generated using primarily the SB approach 
on WA25 hESCs and were subsequently confirmed using the SBB approach on mND2-0 
hiPSCs.
Next, we attempted to convert the non-neural epithelium into otic placode epithelium prior 
to keratinocyte commitment. Human cranial placodes arise at ∼18-24 dpc; thus, assuming 
hPSCs represent cells at ∼12 dpc, otic placodes would develop in our culture within the first 
6-12 days of differentiation with proper signaling modulation (Fig. 1b). Drawing on our 
previous finding that FGF activation and BMP inhibition are essential for pre-placode and 
otic induction from mPSC cultures, we treated day 4 aggregates with a combination of 
FGF-2 and LDN (hereafter, SBFL). With SBFL treatment, the outer epithelium thickened 
relative to SB-treated samples and expressed a combination of posterior placode markers, 
such as PAX8, SOX2, TFAP2A, ECAD, and NCAD, indicating a phenotype similar to the 
otic-epibranchial progenitor domain (OEPD) from which the otic placode arises (Fig. 1h-k; 
Supplementary Fig. 7). When allowed to undergo self-guided differentiation in a minimal 
medium, we found that SBFL aggregates generated BRN3A+ TUJ1+ sensory-like neurons 
between days 10-30 (Supplementary Fig. 8). Since both the epibranchial placodes and the 
otic vesicles produce sensory neurons, we investigated which tissue type had developed. We 
did not detect expression of the otic marker PAX2 nor did we observe any vesicles in SBFL-
treated aggregates, which would signify otic induction (data not shown). Thus, we concluded 
that SBFL treatment may be sufficient to induce epibranchial neurons, yet fails to initiate 
otic induction.
To promote PAX2 expression and vesicle formation, we tested various signaling modulators 
(Supplementary Fig. 9). Although none of the conditions we tested had a detectable effect on 
PAX2 gene expression using qPCR analysis, extensive immunostaining drew our attention to 
a small population of PAX2+ PAX8+ ECAD+ cells in the epithelia of aggregates of control 
samples on day 12, reminiscent of the otic placodes in vivo (Fig. 1l-n). Considering that 
extracellular matrix might provide structural support for vesicle formation, we transferred 
day 12 aggregates to Matrigel droplets in a minimal medium (Fig. 2a). In these cultures, we 
observed radial production of migratory cells but no vesicle-like structures or PAX2+ cells 
(Fig. 2b; Supplementary Fig. 10). Wnt activation seems to be essential for otic, but not 
epibranchial, development in vivo and can enhance the production of mouse inner ear 
organoids in vitro19-22. After Matrigel-embedded WA25 cell aggregates were treated with 
CHIR99021, a GSK3β inhibitor that activates the Wnt pathway23, 90.9 ± 5.2% (± S.D.) of

 the aggregates between days 12-16 (n = 84, 7 experiments) showed epithelial protrusions 
reminiscent of the otic pits that precede vesicle development in vivo (Fig 2c). These 
structures were PAX2+ PAX8+ SOX2+ SOX10+ JAG1+, confirming their otic identity (Fig. 
2d-h; Supplementary Fig. 10). The pits were accompanied by migrating TFAP2A+ SLUG+ 
SOX10+ cranial neural crest–like cells that formed a mesenchyme around the otic pits, 
similar to the peri-otic mesenchyme in vivo (Fig 2c-f; Supplementary Fig. 10).
We cultured the aggregates in stationary droplets until day 18 and then transferred them to a 
24-well plate on an orbital shaker or a spinner flask for further self-organized maturation. 
Both formats produced similar results. At 20-30 days in culture, vesicles remained visible 
through the surface of 71.7 ± 23.3% (± S.D.) WA25 cell aggregates examined (n = 37, 3 
experiments; Supplementary Fig. 11). In each aggregate we immunostained, we found 
multiple otic vesicles surrounding a central core epithelium that expressed the basal 
keratinocyte markers TFAP2A and KRT5 (n = 15, 3 experiments; Fig. 2g-i; Supplementary 
Video 1). As late as day 35, we observed vesicles and otic placode–like epithelia that 
appeared to be partially attached or incorporated into the epidermal epithelium (Fig. 2h). In 
addition, older vesicles (>30 days) expressed the ubiquitin ligase FBXO2, which is highly 
specific to developing inner ear epithelia in mice (Fig. 2i)24,25. Each aggregate we analyzed 
between days 30-40 contained SLUG+ mesenchymal cells and cartilaginous masses with 
S100+ SOX9+ chondrocytes, which also stained positive for Alcian blue (n = 7, 3 
experiments; Supplementary Fig. 10). These tissues likely arise from the cranial neural 
crest–like cells seen during vesicle formation on days 12-18. Thus, our culture system 
appears to derive multiple cranial tissues associated with the anatomic region surrounding 
the inner ear.
After 40-60 days of incubation, vesicles with complex multi-chambered morphologies were 
visible through the aggregate surface (Fig. 2j; Supplementary Video 2). Notably, a subset of 
vesicles in both WA25 and mND2-0 derived aggregates developed epithelia with cells 
expressing multiple hair cell markers, including MYO7A, PCP4, ANXA4, SOX2, and 
CALB2 (Fig. 2k-q; Supplementary Fig. 12). The sensory-like epithelia also contained 
SOX2+ SOX10+ SPARCL1+ cells, reminiscent of supporting cells in the mammalian 
utricle26. The luminal cells in these epithelia had elongated morphologies with F-actin-rich 
apical junctions characteristic of inner ear sensory epithelia (Fig. 2l-o). The cells expressing 
hair cell markers also had F-actin-rich and espin (ESPN)+ apical stereocilia bundles 
protruding into the vesicle lumen that were associated with an acetylated-alpha-Tubulin 
(TUBA4A)+ kinocilium (Fig. 2m-p, r). Together, these findings confirm that the hPSC-
derived otic vesicles generate inner ear organoids with sensory epithelia containing hair cells 
and supporting cells. Moreover, the hair bundle morphology and the densely packed clusters 
of hair cells are reminiscent of vestibular end organs.
To facilitate live-cell imaging and electrophysiological experiments, we engineered an hESC 
reporter cell line to label nascent hair cells with enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP). 
We used the CRISPR/Cas9 system to insert a 2A-eGFP gene cassette at the stop codon of 
the ATOH1 gene, which is highly expressed during hair cell induction and early maturation 
(Fig. 3a; Supplementary Fig. 13)7. We verified inner ear organoid induction from two clones 
containing the bi-allelic insertion of the 2A-eGFP cassette using our established protocol

 (hereafter, ATOH1-2A-eGFP cells). As early as day 39, we observed eGFP+ hair cell-like 
cells emerging in inner ear organoids (Supplementary Fig. 13). The individual organoids 
often contained multiple discrete patches with hundreds of eGFP+ cells (Fig. 3b-d; 
Supplementary Video 3). Immunostaining with hair cell markers, such as BRN3C and ESPN 
(present on 99.4% of eGFP+ hair cell-like cells), confirmed the hair cell identity of eGFP+ 
cells (Fig. 3e, f). Occasionally, we observed eGFP expression in disorganized clusters of 
neuron-like cells, which were clearly distinct from hair cells (∼20% of aggregates, 
Supplementary Fig. 14). Between days 60-100, 19.7 ± 7.0% (± S.D.) of aggregates 
contained at least one organoid with eGFP+ hair cells (n = 167, 7 experiments). The 
seemingly low efficiency of hair cell induction may be due to our inability to detect 
organoids deep within the aggregates, or it could indicate that the endogenous signals 
required for sensory epithelia formation vary from aggregate to aggregate. Every WA25 and 
mND2-0 aggregate examined between days 60-100 contained organoids with PAX8+ PAX2+ 
SOX10+ non-sensory epithelia (n = 21, 5 experiments; Supplementary Fig. 12e), suggesting 
that although inner ear induction is highly reproducible, non-sensory or immature otic 
epithelia are preferentially induced. Using 3D reconstructions, we estimated that there were 
68-779 hair cells per organoid (mean = 266, n = 12 organoids, 4 experiments). The stem 
cell–derived hair cells could be maintained for >150 days in floating culture and retained 
hair bundles even after dissection and sub-culturing (Fig. 3b-f; Supplementary Videos 3-4). 
In mice, Atoh1 is downregulated as hair cells mature; however, we did not detect any 
noticeable changes in eGFP expression in day 100-150 organoids, suggesting that 
maturation may be delayed or ATOH1 expression is more prolonged in human inner ear 
organogenesis.
Next we examined whether hPSC-derived hair cells function similarly to native mammalian 
hair cells. Using aggregates generated from ATOH1-2A-eGFP cells, we dissected and flat-
mounted inner ear organoids between differentiation days 63-70. The cells had large 
outwardly rectifying currents (Fig. 4a-c), typical of type II hair cells of human vestibular 
organs27, mouse vestibular organs28 and mouse organoid hair cells7. The amplitude of the 
currents ranged from several hundred picoAmps to several nanoAmps, presumably 
depending on the maturity of the cell. Small rapidly activating, rapidly inactivating inward 
currents were also present in 6 of 14 hPSC-derived hair cells (Fig. 4d), consistent with the 
small Na+ currents transiently expressed in developing mouse hair cells28 and mouse 
organoid hair cells7. Hyperpolarizing steps evoked slowly activating inward currents (Fig. 
4e, f) that resembled Ih of human27 and mouse29 vestibular type II hair cells, but atypical of 
mammalian cochlear hair cells. Responses to step and sinusoidal current injection (Fig. 4g, 
h) resembled those of rodent vestibular and organoid hair cells7, with an initial peak 
followed by repolarization, and larger excursions for hyperpolarizing than depolarizing 
current injections. Resting potentials of the hPSC-derived organoid hair cells were slightly 
depolarized (−51 ± 2.4 mV, n = 6) relative to those of rodent vestibular cells. Negative 
resting potentials in mouse vestibular hair cells are maintained by prominent inward rectifier 
currents, which are carried by Kir2.1 channels30. Inward rectifier currents develop early in 
all rodent vestibular hair cells and mouse organoid hair cells but were absent in human 
organoid cells and native human vestibular cells27. The constricted lumen morphology seen 
in most >60-days-old organoids and in all of the organoids used for recording made hair

 bundle deflection and mechanotransduction analysis inaccessible (for example see Fig. 3b-e; 
Supplementary Video 3). Nonetheless, to our knowledge there have been no previous 
recordings of voltage-dependent currents and membrane response (Fig. 4a-h) from hPSC-
derived human hair cells. Furthermore, the profile of current expression strongly suggests 
that the hPSC-derived organoid cells, like mouse inner ear organoid cells, have adopted a 
vestibular type II hair cell phenotype.
Finally, we examined neurogenesis during inner ear organoid formation. We observed the 
first sign of TUJ1+ BRN3A+ neurons in aggregates between days 20-30 after the start of 
differentiation (Supplementary Fig. 15). Immunostaining for TUJ1 and neurofilaments (light 
chain, NEFL, and heavy chain, NEFH) between days 60-75 revealed a mix of unipolar and 
bipolar neurons surrounding inner ear organoids (Fig. 4i, j and Supplementary Video 5). 
Inner ear ganglia neurons are bipolar, whereas epibranchial and neural crest ganglia neurons 
typically mature from a bipolar to a unipolar morphology31,32; thus, the cells observed here 
may be derived from placode or neural crest. We also observed S100β+ cells, reminiscent of 
myelinating Schwann cells, associated with NEFL+ soma and processes (Fig. 4k and 
Supplementary Fig. 15). In each sensory epithelium we analysed, we found neurites 
infiltrating the epithelium and contacting hair cells (Fig 4j-l, n = 15 sensory epithelia, 6 
separate experiments). A subset of hair cells displayed CTBP2+ puncta, indicating putative 
ribbon synapse–like structures. (Fig 4l, m and Supplementary Fig 15). Moreover, the 
CTBP2+ puncta were typically localized near synaptophysin (SYP)+ puncta, a post-synaptic 
marker of ribbon synapses (Fig. 4m and Supplementary Fig. 15)26. Together, these findings 
suggest that the human inner ear organoids assemble a sensorineural circuit between hair 
cells and sensory neurons, similar to in vivo organs and mouse inner ear organoids (Fig. 
4n)6,7,31. However, it remains to be determined whether the neurons innervating hair cells 
are authentic vestibular afferent neurons and whether the putative synapses are functional.
In conclusion, we have established a robust differentiation system for guiding the 
development of human inner ear organoids in 3D culture (see Supplementary Fig. 16 and 
Supplementary Table 5 for a comparison to past human otic induction approaches). Our 
findings support our previous model of in vitro pre-otic induction and underscore the 
importance of carefully timed GSK3β inhibition for otic placode specification. Notably, the 
convoluted and multi-chambered morphologies of human inner ear organoids bear a striking 
resemblance to the inner ear's membranous labyrinth, which consists of a series of tubes and 
chambers containing sensory and non-sensory epithelia (Figures 2j-l, 3i and Supplementary 
Videos 2-5). In addition, much like mouse organoids, the hPSC-derived organoids appear to 
form vestibular sensory epithelia by default; thus, additional signaling manipulation will be 
needed to initiate cochlear organogenesis6,7. We expect that this culture system will provide 
a useful tool for uncovering mechanisms of human inner ear development, studying genetic 
disease of the inner ear, and testing potential therapies.

cat. no. Ant-nr-1) on recombinant human Vitronectin-N (Invitrogen, cat. no. A14700)-coated 
6-well plates according to an established protocol33. At 80% confluency or every 4-5 days, 
the cells were passaged at a split ratio of 1:10-1:20 using 0.5 mM EDTA in DPBS. Both cell 
lines were acquired from the WiCell Research Institute and arrived with a statement of 
verification and authenticity. For additional validation and testing information refer to the

mnd2-0.cmsx. Cell lines were determined to be mycoplasma contamination-free using the 
MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Lonza). Prior to differentiation, pluripotency was 
assessed using immunocytochemistry to detect stem-cell markers, SOX2, OCT4, and 
SSEA-1 (see Supplementary Figs. 1, 5, and 13). Routine karyotyping was not performed, 
however, the passage number was minimized to reduce the risk of spontaneous chromosomal 
duplications or genetic mutations.
hPSC differentiation
To start differentiation, hPSC cells were dissociated with StemPro Accutase (Invitrogen, cat. 
no. A1110501) and distributed, 5,000 cells per well, onto low-adhesion 96-well V-bottom 
plates in E8 medium containing 20 μM Y-27632 (Stemgent, cat. no. 04-0012-02) and 
Normocin. Following a 48 hour incubation, the aggregates were transferred to low-adhesion 
96-well U-bottom plates in 100 μl of Chemically Defined Medium (CDM) containing 4 ng 
ml-1 FGF-2 (Peprotech, cat. no. 100-18B), 10 μM SB-431542 (Stemgent, cat. no. 
04-0010-05), and, for some experiments, 2.5 ng ml-1 BMP4 (Stemgent, cat. no. 03-0007), 
and 2% Growth Factor Reduced (GFR) Matrigel (Corning, cat. no. 354230) to initiate non-
neural induction—i.e. differentiation day 0. CDM contained a 50:50 mixture of F-12 
Nutrient Mixture with GlutaMAX (Gibco) and Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's Medium with 
GlutaMAX (IMDM; Gibco) additionally supplemented with 0.5% Bovine Serum Albumin 
(BSA), 1X Chemically Defined Lipid Concentrate (Invitrogen), 7 μg ml-1 Insulin (Sigma), 
15 μg ml-1 Transferrin (Sigma), 450 μM Mono-Thioglycerol, and Normocin (see 
Supplementary Table 1 for detailed formulation). After 4 days of incubation, 25 μl of CDM 
containing a 250 ng ml-1 FGF-2 (50 ng/ml final concentration) and 1 μM LDN-193189 (200 
nM final concentration; Stemgent, cat. no. 04-0074-02) was added to the pre-existing 100 μl 
of media in each well. After an additional 4 days (8 days total), 25 μl of CDM was added to 
the media. For some experiments, CDM containing a 18 μM CHIR99021 (3 μM final 
concentration; Stemgent, 04-0004-02) was added to the pre-existing 125 μl of media in each 
well on day 8—we determined that this treatment is optional for inner ear organoid 
production, but may improve induction of otic placode-like cells. On differentiation day 12, 
the aggregates were pooled together and washed with freshly prepared Organoid Maturation 
Medium (OMM) containing a 50:50 mixture of Advanced DMEM:F12 (Gibco) and 
Neurobasal Medium (Gibco) supplemented with 0.5× N2 Supplement (Gibco), 0.5× B27 
without Vitamin A (Gibco), 1× GlutaMAX (Gibco), 0.1 mM β-Mercaptoethanol (Gibco), 
and Normocin (see Supplementary Table 2 for detailed formulation). The aggregates were 
resuspended in ice cold undiluted GFR Matrigel and distributed in ∼25 μl droplets on the 
surface of a 100 mm culture plate. After at least 30 minutes of incubation at 37°C, the 
droplets were bathed in 10 ml of OMM containing 3 μM CHIR99021. For non-droplet otic

 induction, the aggregates were washed and plated individually into each well of a 24-well 
low cell adhesion plate in OMM containing 3 μM CHIR and 1% GFR Matrigel. For both 
culture formats, the medium was changed completely on day 15 with OMM containing fresh 
3 μM CHIR. During days 12-18, aggregates were monitored using DIC imaging daily. Otic 
pit-like protrusions were identifiable as bright translucent bulges from the dark core of the 
aggregates. On day 15 or 16, a subset of at least three aggregates were fixed, cryosectioned, 
and immunostained using PAX2/PAX8 antibodies to positively identify otic pit-like 
structures. On day 18 of differentiation, the CHIR was removed from the medium by 
washing and the droplet aggregates were moved to a floating culture. Droplets were 
carefully dislodged using a wide-mouth P1000 tip and transferred to 75 ml of fresh OMM in 
a 125 ml disposable spinner flask (Corning). Spinner flasks were maintained on an in-
incubator stir plate (Thermo Scientific) at 65 RPM for up to 180 days of differentiation. For 
some experiments, the aggregates were maintained in individual wells of 24-well low-cell 
adhesion plates in 1 ml of OMM on an in-incubator orbital shaker (Thermo Scientific) at 65 
RPM for up to 140 days. Technical repeats entailed a different start date, different passage 
number, and typically a different lot of reagents (some experiments used the same reagent 
lots).
Choice of Media Components—We used two media components that may lead to 
variability in results due to lack of definition or poor compatibility with human cells: GFR 
Matrigel and BSA. GFR Matrigel contains, < 0.1 pg ml-1 FGF-2, < 0.5 ng ml-1 EGF, 5 ng 
ml-1 IGF-1, < 5 pg ml-1 PDGF, < 0.2 ng ml-1 NGF, and 1.7 ng ml-1 TGFβ. In particular, the 
TGFβ in GFR Matrigel may have impacted cell fate specification on day 12 or later because 
we did not include a TGFβ inhibitor in the media during that phase of culture. GFR Matrigel 
was chosen because it has been shown to be a reliable inducer of self-organizing epithelia 
from pluripotent stem cells in 3D culture34. A purified Laminin/Entactin complex (Corning) 
may be a suitable, fully defined, alternative35. In the CDM, BSA was chosen as a cost-
effective and easy to dissolve alternative to Human Serum Albumin and Polyvinyl Alcohol 
(PVA), respectively. PVA has been shown to be a suitable chemically defined substitute for 
BSA in CDM36.
Signaling molecules and recombinant proteins
The following small molecules and recombinant proteins were used: recombinant human 
BMP4 (2.5-10 ng ml−1; Stemgent), human FGF-2 (25 ng ml−1; Peprotech), SB-431542 (10 
μM; Stemgent), CHIR99021 (3 μM; Stemgent), and LDN-193189 (200 nM; Stemgent).
Quantitative PCR
Analysis was performed as previously described on an ABI PRISM 7900HT Sequence 
Detection System (Applied Biosystems) or a Bio-Rad CFX96 quantitative PCR machine 
(Bio-Rad)6. Data were normalized to L27 expression (internal control) and the fold change 
was calculated relative to Ct values from d0 WA25 aggregates using the ΔΔCt method. 
Unless stated otherwise, data represent at least 3 separate biological samples from separate 
experiments. All indicators of statistical significance refer to comparisons between a given 
condition and the control group. Refer to Supplementary Table 3 for primer details.

 Immunohistochemistry
Aggregates were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature or at 4°C 
overnight. The fixed specimens were cryoprotected with a graded treatment of 15% and 30% 
sucrose and then embedded in tissue freezing medium. Frozen tissue blocks were sectioned 
into 12 μm cryosections on a Leica CM-1860 cryostat. For immunostaining, a 10% goat or 
horse serum in 0.1% Triton X-100 1X PBS solution was used for blocking, and a 3% goat or 
horse serum in 0.1% Triton X-100 1X PBS solution was used for primary/secondary 
antibody incubations. Alexa Fluor conjugated anti-mouse, rabbit, or goat IgG (Invitrogen) 
were used as secondary antibodies. ProLong Gold Antifade Reagent with DAPI (Thermo 
Scientific) was used to mount the samples and visualize cellular nuclei. For wholemount 
staining, a similar staining paradigm was used; however, the Triton X-100 concentration was 
increased to 0.5%, and the blocking and primary/secondary incubations were done at 37°C 
on a rotating shaker for 24 hours and 48 hours, respectively. Following each incubation, the 
samples were subjected to three 1-hour washes in 1X PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 at 
37°C on a rotating shaker. Wholemount samples were mounted in ScaleS4 clearing solution 
for 1-2 days or ScaleSQ(5) clearing solution for 1-2 hours prior to imaging37. Microscopy 
was performed on a Leica DMi8 inverted microscope, a Nikon TE2000 inverted microscope, 
or an Olympus FV1000-MPE Confocal/Multiphoton Microscope. 3D reconstruction was 
performed using the Imaris 8 software package (Bitplane) housed at the Indiana Center for 
Biological Microscopy. For the segmentation analysis in Supplementary Video 3 and 
estimates of hair cell number per organoid, eGFP+ cells were processed using the ‘Spots’ 
module in Imaris. Classification was based on estimated size, quality and signal intensity. 
Objects touching the border of the image were excluded. The following build parameters 
were used to identify eGFP+ cell bodies: estimated XY diameter = 7.00 μm; estimated Z 
diameter = 10.00 μm; ‘Quality’ above 20.0; ‘distance to image border XYZ’ above 0.001 
μm; ‘intensity center Ch = 1′ above 1,500. These parameters generated estimated, not 
absolute, counts and were adjusted to provide highly conservative values. For quality 
control, we performed slice-by-slice analysis of optical sections for three representative 
organoids. Movies were generated in Imaris from the raw image files and compiled in 
Adobe Premiere Pro to add titles and text. See Supplementary Table 4 for a list of 
antibodies.
Electrophysiological recordings
Human organoids were shipped at day 62 in cold Hibernate A medium supplemented with 
1X GlutaMax, 1× B27 Supplement (without Vitamin A), 22 mM NaCl, and Normocin. They 
were replaced back into OMM on day 63 in an incubator at 5% CO2 and 37°C. On recording 
days, organoids were dissected out using sharp tungsten needles (Fine Science Tools) and 
pinned to glass coverslips. The eGFP+ signal was used to find areas with hair cells and to 
target hair cells for recording. Whole-cell patch clamp was performed on the semi-intact 
tissue with 4-5 MΩ glass electrodes. Data were acquired using an Axopatch 200B amplifier 
(Molecular Devices), filtered at 5000 Hz, then digitized at 20 kHz through a Digidata 1322A 
converter. The recording pipette solution contained (in mM): 135 KCl, 5 HEPES, 5 EGTA, 
2.5 MgCl2, 2.5 K2-ATP, 0.1 CaCl2, adjusted with KOH to pH 7.4, ∼285 mmol kg-1. The 
external solution contained: 137 NaCl, 5.8 KCl, 0.7 NaH2PO4, 10 HEPES, 1.3 CaCl2, 0.9 
MgCl2, 5.6 Glucose, and was supplemented with vitamins and essential amino acids

 (Invitrogen), adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH, ∼310 mmol kg-1. Recordings were 
compensated 40% and cells were held at −66 mV for voltage clamp. Averages are reported ± 
SEM.
Generation of ATOH1-2A-eGFP reporter cell line
gRNAs (5′-TCGGATGAGGCAAGTTAGGA-3′ and 5′-
GTCACTGTAATGGGAATGGG-3′, offset = 0bp) targeting the stop codon region of 
ATOH1 were cloned into pSpCas9n(BB) vectors which express Cas9n under the control of 
CBh promoter (Addgene #48873)38. To construct the donor vector, a 2A-eGFP-PGK-Puro 
cassette (Addgene #31938)39 flanked by two 1kb homology arms PCR amplified from 
extracted WA25 hESC genomic DNA were cloned into a pUC19 backbone. The two gRNA 
vectors and the donor vector, as well as a vector expressing Cas9n under the control of CMV 
promoter (Addgene #41816)40 were transfected into WA25 hESCs with 4D Nucleofector 
(Lonza) using the P3 Primary Cell 4D-Nucleofector X kit and Program CB-150. After 
nucleofection, cells were plated in growth medium containing 1× RevitaCell (Thermo 
Fisher) for improved cell survival rate, and 1μM of Scr7 (Xcessbio) for higher HDR 
efficiency41. 0.5 μg ml-1 puromycin selection was performed for 10 days starting from 48 
hours post-nucleofection. The PGK-Puro sub-cassette flanked by two LoxP sites was 
removed from the genome after puromycin selection by nucleofection of a Cre recombinase 
expressing vector (Addgene #13775). Clonal cell lines were established by low-density 
seeding (1 – 3 cells cm-2) of dissociated single hESCs followed by isolation of hESC 
colonies after 5-7 days of expansion. Genotypes of the clonal cell lines were analyzed by 
PCR amplification followed by gel electrophoresis, and by Sanger sequencing of total PCR 
amplicons or individual PCR amplicons cloned into TOPO vectors. Cell lines with bi-allelic 
eGFP integration were used for inner ear hair cell differentiation. Hair cell-bearing 
organoids were identified using an inverted epiflorescent microscope (Leica DMi8). We only 
counted eGFP+ cells observed in an organoid epithelium with defined apical and basal edges 
that were located toward the surface of the aggregate. Hair cell bearing organoids located in 
the interior of the aggregates were undetectable using this approach.
Statistical analysis
All statistics were performed using GraphPad Prism 7 software. A Shapiro-Wilk normality 
test was used prior to analysis to determine that the data had a normal distribution. Statistical 
significance was determined using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by a 
Dunnett's post-hoc test for multiple comparisons to a control group (e.g. vehicle treated). A 
Brown-Forsythe test was used to determine that the variation among sample groups was 
similar. No statistical test was used to predetermine sample size, the investigators were not 
blinded to the treatment groups, and the samples were not randomized.
Representative Data and Reproducibility
Unless stated otherwise, images are representative of specimens obtained from at least 3 
separate experiments. For IHC analysis of aggregates between days 0-12, we typically 
sectioned 3-6 aggregates from each condition in each experiment. IHC analyses for later 
stages of the protocol were performed on at least 2 aggregates from each condition per 
experiment. The finalized culture method was successfully replicated 23 times by four

 independent investigators (K.R.K., J.N., E.L.M., and J.L.) using the WA25 (wild-type or 
ATOH1-2A-eGFP) cell line. The method, with noted modifications, was replicated 3 times 
using the mND2-0 iPSC line by K.R.K. A replication was deemed successful by confirming 
pit formation during days 12-18 and positively identifying hair cell-bearing inner ear 
organoids in at least one aggregate on days 50-100 of differentiation. If either of these 
criteria were not met, an experiment was deemed a failure and excluded from analysis. The 
investigators observed a failure rate of ∼21% (6/29 experiments), which was typically 
attributed to expiration/mishandling of a critical reagent or technical error.

 neurites in the sensory epithelium. j, Representative image of NEFL+ neurons innervating an 
organoid sensory epithelium. k, S100β+ Schwann-like cells associate with neuronal soma 
and appear to myelinate NEFL+ neuronal processes. l, NEFL+ neuronal processes infiltrate 
the epithelium and are closely associated with CTBP2+ puncta at the base of eGFP+ hair 
cells. m, CTBP2+ puncta are co-localized with SYP+ puncta. n, Summary of neurogenesis 
analysis. Scale bars, 100 μm (i), 25 μm (j, k), 10 μm (l, m), 5 μm (i insets).
