Abstract
Taxane therapy remains the standard of care for triple-neg-
ative breast cancer. However, high frequencies of recurrence
and progression in treated patients indicate that metastatic
breast cancer cells can acquire resistance to this drug. The actin
regulatory protein MENA and particularly its invasive isoform,
MENAINV, are established drivers of metastasis. MENAINV
expression is significantly correlated with metastasis and poor
outcome in human patients with breast cancer. We investigated
whether MENA isoforms might play a role in driving resistance
to chemotherapeutics. We find that both MENA and MENAINV
confer resistance to the taxane paclitaxel, but not to the
widely used DNA-damaging agents doxorubicin or cisplatin.
Furthermore, paclitaxel treatment does not attenuate growth of
MENAINV-driven metastatic lesions. Mechanistically, MENA
isoform expression alters the ratio of dynamic and stable
microtubule populations in paclitaxel-treated cells. MENA
expression also increases MAPK signaling in response to
paclitaxel treatment. Decreasing ERK phosphorylation by co-
treatment with MEK inhibitor restored paclitaxel sensitivity by
driving microtubule stabilization in MENA isoform–expressing
cells. Our results reveal a novel mechanism of taxane resistance

metastatic

cells

Introduction
While the number of targeted agents in clinical trials for
metastatic breast cancer continues to increase, chemotherapy
remains the standard of care for this disease, particularly for
triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), one of the most aggressive
breast cancer subtypes (1). TNBC, defined by a lack of expression
of both estrogen and progesterone receptors as well as low levels
of HER2, accounts for 15% of breast tumors. TNBC is associated
with a poorer prognosis along with a greater risk of recurrence and
metastasis (2, 3). Platinum agents, taxanes and anthracyclines, are
used in mono- or poly-chemotherapy as front-line treatment,
especially in the context of metastatic disease (4). Antimitotic
chemotherapy agents generally target proliferating cancer cells,
with platinum agents such as cisplatin and anthracyclines includ-
ing doxorubicin primarily functioning through direct interaction
with DNA and subsequent interference with its replication. In
contrast, taxanes such as paclitaxel lead to mitotic catastrophe by
stabilizing microtubules and inhibiting their disassembly during
metaphase, thus leading to mitotic arrest and cell death (5, 6). The
benefits of cytotoxic chemotherapy for TNBC are clear; neverthe-
less, response rates are low, and more than 50% of patients with
TNBC become resistant to chemotherapy typically by 6 to 10
months (7).
A number of cellular processes are known to drive chemore-
sistance, which can arise from both cell-intrinsic mechanisms
and tumor microenvironment–driven external survival signals
(8). First, changes in expression of the ATP-binding cassette
(ABC) superfamily of transporters, in particular P-gp/MDR1,
have been shown to be involved in paclitaxel resistance (9).
While in vitro and preclinical studies showed increased cell
death with dual chemotherapy and MDR1 inhibitor, the first
and second generation of inhibitors both failed in clinical
trials due to safety and efficacy issues (9). Second, mutations
in a drug's cellular targets, b-tubulin in the case of taxanes, can
drive cell-intrinsic resistance by impairing paclitaxel binding,
increasing
microtubule
dynamics,
and
blocking
taxane-
induced G2–M arrest (10). Third, changes in expression or
function of proteins of the apoptosis pathways, such as
caspase-3 or Bcl-2, have also been implicated in taxane resis-
tance (11, 12). Chemotherapy-induced proapoptotic signals
can be counteracted by constitutive activation of the prosur-
vival PI3K/Akt/mTOR or RAF/RAS/MEK MAPK signaling path-
ways (13). Paclitaxel treatment can induce MAPK activation to
attenuate microtubule stabilization (10), and multiple studies
have demonstrated that co-treatment with paclitaxel and a
MEK inhibitor can increase cancer cell death (14). Much of
our understanding of these and other mechanisms of taxane
resistance is derived from studies focused on cell survival and
proliferation. The question of how such mechanisms of resis-
tance are associated with cell invasion and metastatic disease
itself remains understudied.

 One key driver of breast cancer metastasis is MENA (alsoknown
as ENAH or hMena), a member of the Ena/VASP family of actin
elongation factors that is upregulated in various cancer types,
including breast cancer (15). MENA deficiency in the PyMT mouse
model of breast cancer slows tumor progression and decreases
metastasis (16), and stable depletion of MENA in the human
breast adenocarcinoma MDA-MB-231 cells significantly decreases
metastatic burden from orthotopic xenograft tumors (17). In
addition to a broadly expressed 80-kDa MENA isoform, multiple
other MENA protein isoforms can arise in some cell types from
changes in the inclusion of 5 alternatively spliced exons in the
MENA mRNA (18–20). In human patients with breast cancer and
in mouse breast cancer models, changes in expression of 2
functionally distinct isoforms, MENA11a and MENAINV, are
linked to metastatic tumor cell phenotypes and to patient out-
comes. MENA11a expression is high in normal epithelial tissues
and in epithelial-like cells in breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo
(19, 21) but is low in invasive tumor cell subpopulations (22).
Mena11a suppresses tumor cell migration and invasion and
promotes cohesive tumor morphology (19, 21, 23). While
expression levels of either MENA or MENA11a alone do not
correlate breast cancer patient outcome (17, 24), patients with
high Menacalc, a measure of the total Mena levels minus MENA11a
levels, have poor disease-specific survival (24, 25).
In contrast to MENA11a, MENAINV expression is significantly
higher in metastatic than in nonmetastatic human breast tumors,
and high levels of MENAINV, but not MENA, are associated with
increased metastasis and poor outcome in multiple human breast
cancer cohorts (17). MENAINV is highly upregulated in invasive
tumor cell subpopulations in vivo but found only at trace levels in
even highly aggressive breast cancer cell lines in culture (22, 26).
Expression of MENAINV in breast tumor cells renders them more
sensitive to multiple proinvasive growth factors (27, 28) and
increases their ability migrate toward higher concentration of
fibronectin, which is especially abundant near blood vessels
(17). As a consequence, cells expressing MENAINV are more
invasive and are highly metastatic. MENAINV has been shown to
drive resistance to targeted kinase inhibitors in growth factor–
elicited motility responses (28); however, its role in regulating
responses to chemotherapeutic drugs has never been studied.
Chemotherapy regimens containing taxanes are the standard of
care for patients with metastatic breast cancer (29). Given the fact
that both MENAINV and MENA are expressed in metastatic breast
tumors and drive prometastatic phenotypes, we wondered wheth-
er expression of MENA and MENAINV affected tumor cell
responses to chemotherapy, and how, in turn, standard-of-care
cytotoxic therapy might influence MENA/MENAINV-driven metas-
tasis. We show, using in vitro and in vivo models, that highly
metastatic cells expressing MENA or MENAINV confer paclitaxel
resistance, by preventing the microtubule stabilization via acti-
vation of the MAPK signaling cascade. Our findings reveal a novel
mechanism by which highly metastatic breast cancer cells can
become resistant to taxanes.
Materials and Methods
Antibodies and drugs
Antibodies. The anti-MENA and anti-MENAINV antibodies were
generated in the laboratory and previously described (26, 30):
anti-tubulin (Sigma, DM1A), anti-tubulin detyrosinated or Glu-
Tubulin (Millipore, AB3201), anti-tubulin tyrosinated (Millipore,
ABT171), anti-pERK Y204 (Santa Cruz, sc7383), anti-GAPDH
(Sigma, G9545), anti-Ki67 (BD Biosciences), cleaved Caspase-3
(BD Biosciences), and anti-pAkt473 (CST).
Drugs. Doxorubicin, cisplatin and paclitaxel (Sigma), docetaxel
were the drugs used. For in vitro experiment, drugs were diluted in
cell culture media with 1% of DMSO. Vehicle control correspond
to cells treated with culture media with 1% of DMSO (no drug),
PD0325901 MEK inhibitor (LC Labs), MDR1 inhibitor HM30181
(100 nmol/L) gift from the Weissleder Laboratory (MGH; ref. 31).
Cell culture
MDA-MB-231 cells were purchased directly from the ATCC in
June 2012, where cell lines are authenticated by STR profiling.
These cells were not reauthenticated by our laboratory and were
cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS (Hyclone). Cell line generation
and FACS were performed as previously described (32). Cell lines
show an 8- to 10-fold overexpression relative to endogenous
MENA and are labeled 231-Control, 231-MENA, and 231-
MENAINV (17). SUM159 cells were obtained from Joan Brugge
laboratory at Harvard Medical School (January 2011) and were
not reauthenticated in our laboratory. SUM159 cells were cul-
tured according to the ATCC protocols. T47D cells were purchased
at ATCC, where cell lines are authenticated by STR profiling. They
were cultured according to the manufacturer's protocol and not
reauthenticated in our laboratory. Stable knockdown cell lines
(T47D) were generated using a retroviral vector to express an
mir30-based shRNA sequence `CAGAAGACAATCGCCCTTTAA'
targeting a sequence shared among all known Mena mRNA iso-
forms. Western blot analysis, detected using an anti-Mena mono-
clonal that recognizes an epitope shared in all known Mena
protein isoforms (33), indicated that expression of all molecular
species detected were significantly reduced in the T47D-ShMena
cell line; expression analysis of specific MENA isoforms was not
performed. MDA-MB-175IIV, MDA-MB-453, MDA-MB-436, BT-
549, LM2, and BT-20 were gifted by. Dr Michael Yaffe laboratory
(Koch Institute, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cam-
bridge, MA) in April 2015 and cultured according to the manu-
facturer's protocol and not reauthenticated by our laboratory.
Cell viability assay
Cell viability assays were performed in a 96-well plate. Five
thousand cells were plated per well and treated with drug 24 hours
later. Cell viability was assessed 72 hours later using the Presto-
Blue Cell Viability Reagent (Life Technologies), according to
manufacturer's protocol. Fluorescence was measured and nor-
malized to cells exposed to vehicle. The activity area was calcu-
lated from dose–response plots using MATLAB. All measurements
were repeated in triplicates.
Xenograft tumor generation and in vivo chemotherapy
treatment
All animal experiments were approved by the MIT Division of
Comparative Medicine. Two million MDA-MB-231 cells expres-
sing different MENA isoforms (in PBS and 20% collagen I) were
injected into the fourth right mammary fat pad of 6-week-old
female NOD/SCID mice (Taconic). When the tumors reached 1
cm in diameter, mice were treated every 5 days with 3 doses of
paclitaxel at 10 mg/kg in 1% DMSO, 3% PEG (MW 400), 1%
Tween-80 in PBS by intraperitoneal injection. In parallel, mice

 were treated with only 1% DMSO, 3% PEG (MW 400), 1%
Tween-80 in PBS as a vehicle control. One day after the last
injection, tumors were measured and mice were used for
intravital imaging and then sacrificed. Their tumors and lungs
were fixed in 10% formalin overnight and their bone marrow
was collected using PBS and cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS.
The number of tumor cell colonies in cultured bone morrow
was counted 1 month after collection. The number of metas-
tasis in each lobe of the lung was counted from lung hema-
toxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained sections visualized by light
microscopy and counted by 2 blinded individuals. Each tumor
group contained 3 to 5 mice.
Intravital imaging
Intravital multiphoton imaging was performed as described
previously (17) using a 25� 1.05 NA water immersion objective
with correction lens. After exposing the tumor with a skin flap
surgery, 30-minute movies were captured. The number of motile
cells in each field of view was counted in ten 30-minute time-lapse
movies using ImageJ. Motile cells were cells that showed any
displacement of the nucleus and cell protrusion activity. Data
were pooled from 2 to 4 mice per tumor group, with 4 to 10 fields
imaged per mouse.
Western blot
Cells were lysed in 25 mmol/L Tris, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 10%
glycerol, 1% NP-40, and 0.5 mol/L EDTA with a Mini-Complete
protease inhibitor (Roche) and a phosphatase inhibitor cock-
tail (PhosSTOP, Roche) at 4�C for 20 minutes. Protein lysates
were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose
membrane, and blocked with Odyssey Blocking Buffer (LiCor).
Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies overnight
at 4�C and LiCor secondary antibodies at room temperature for
1 hour. Protein level intensity was measured with ImageJ.
Immunohistochemistry
Tumors dissected from NOD/SCID mice were fixed in 10%
buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. Tissue sections
(5 mm thick) were deparaffinized followed by antigen retrieval
using Citra Plus solution (Biogenex). After treatment with 3%
H2O2, sections were blocked with serum, incubated with pri-
mary antibodies overnight at 4�C and fluorescently labeled
secondary antibodies at room temperature for 2 hours. Sections
were stained using anti-MENA (1:500), biotinylated anti-
MENAINV (1:500), anti-CC3 (1:200), anti-Ki67 (1:200), and
DAPI. Fluorochromes on secondary antibodies included Alex-
aFluor 488, 594, or 647 (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Sections
were mounted in Fluoromount mounting media and imaged at
room temperature. Z-series of images were taken on a DeltaVi-
sion microscope using Softworx acquisition, an Olympus 40�
1.3 NA plan apo objective and a Photometrics CoolSNAP HQ
camera. At least 10 fields were captured for each tumor, with at
least 3 tumors per tumor group.
Human breast cancer expression analysis
Data retrieval from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA; ref. 34;
Supplementary Fig. S1A and S1B) was explained by Oudin and
colleagues (17). The data for MENAINV protein levels as measured
by immunohistochemistry (IHC) are also described by Oudin
and colleagues (17), from patient samples obtained from the
study done by Wang and colleagues (35).
In vitro imaging
Glass-bottom dishes were coated with collagen at 0.1 mg/mL
diluted in PBS for 1 hour at 37�C. Cells expressing different MENA
isoform were treated with paclitaxel at 1, 10, or 100 nmol/L or
vehicle and immediately plated on the glass-bottom dishes.
Thirty-minutes later, cells were imaged overnight, with one image
acquired every 10 minutes for 16 hours on a Nikon spinning disk
with a 20� objective and an Andor/NeoZyla camera. Individual
cells were manually tracked using ImageJ and Manual Tracking
plug-in. Data were analyzed using the chemotaxis tool developed
by IBIDI. For analysis of time spent in cell division, we measured
the time between when the mother cell first rounds up, to when
both daughter cells have spread out on substrate. The percentage
of successful cell divisions was quantified by counting the number
of cell divisions that lead to 2 surviving daughter cells. Data
are pooled from at least 50 cells tracked in 3 independent
experiments.
Cell-cycle analysis
231-Control, 231-MENA, and 231-MENAINV cells were treated
with paclitaxel at 10 or 100 nmol/L or vehicle. After 16 hours of
treatment, cells were trypsinized, washed in cold PBS, centrifuged
at 1,000 rpm for 3 minutes, resuspended in 1 mL of ice-cold PBS,
fixed by adding 4 mL of ethanol at �20�C, and incubated at 4�C
for 1 hour. After fixation, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and
centrifuged at 22,000 rpm for 20 minutes. DNA was stained using
propidium iodide at 50 mg/mL and RNase A at 1 mg/mL for 30
minutes at 37�C. DNA content was measured on a FACSCalibur
cytometer (Becton-Dickinson). Data were analyzed using Modfit
software (Verity Software House), with appropriate gating on the
FL2-A and FL2-W channels to exclude cell aggregates. Twenty-five
thousand events were analyzed per sample.
Immunofluorescence
Glass-bottom dishes (Mattek) were coated with collagen at 0.1
mg/mL diluted in PBS and 50 mg/ml fibronectin for 1 hour at
37�C. Cells were plated for 1 hour and then treated with paclitaxel
alone or in combination with MEKi for 24 hours. Cells were fixed
for 20 minutes in 4% paraformaldehyde in PHEM buffer with
0.1% glutaraldehyde and then quenched with sodium borohy-
drate for 5 minutes. Cells were blocked with 2% BSA in TBS/0.1%
Triton X-100 for 30 minutes and incubated with primary anti-
bodies and then secondary antibodies for 1 hour each, at room
temperature. Z-series of images were taken on an Applied Preci-
sion DeltaVision microscope using Softworx acquisition, an
Olympus 60� 1.4 NA plan apo objective and a Photometrics
CoolSNAP HQ camera. Images were deconvolved using Deltavi-
sion Softworx software and objective specific point spread func-
tion. Images were analyzed with ImageJ, where the whole-cell
intensity levels of Tyr-MT or Glu-MT were measured. Images are
pooled from at least 3 independent experiments.
Microtubule length image analysis
Microtubule images were processed with (i) a filament recon-
struction algorithm that selects bona fide filaments and (ii) a post-
analysis that quantifies the properties of the microtubule network
organization. For the filament reconstruction, briefly, the micro-
tubule images were first filtered by multiple-scale steerable filter to
enhance the curvilinear features. From the filtered images, the
centerlines
of
possible
filament
fragments
were

 low-confidence filament fragments were linked to high-confi-
dence fragments using iterative graph matching. The output of
the reconstruction is a network of filaments each presented by an
ordered chain of pixels and the local filament orientation. The
microtubule length was calculated as the number of pixels con-
verted to microns, per each identified filament. Overall, at least
2,000 microtubules were analyzed per condition, from at least 2
experiments.
Results
MENA and MENAINV are associated with increased survival
during paclitaxel treatment in vitro
To investigate a potential role for MENA in resistance to
chemotherapy in breast cancer, we first asked whether endoge-
nous MENA and MENAINV expression levels were associated with
paclitaxel resistance. MENA and MENAINV are widely expressed in
all main breast cancer subtypes, as measured by mRNA from
TCGA samples, as well as at the protein level by IHC (ref. 17;
Supplementary Fig. S1A–S1C), with slightly higher expression in
patients with Her2þ breast cancer. We then measured paclitaxel
efficacy and quantified levels of endogenous MENA protein
expression across cell lines from several human breast cancer
types, including Luminal A (MDA-MB-175IIV and T47D), HER2-
positive (MDA-MB-453), and TNBC (SUM159, BT-20, MDA-MB-
436, LM2, BT-549, MDA-MB-231; Fig. 1A and B, Supplementary
Fig. S1D). In addition to the canonical 80-kDa MENA isoform,
some the cell lines used express other MENA isoforms endoge-
nously, such as MENA11a, which is known to be expressed in
epithelial-like cell lines including T47D cells and absent from
mesenchymal-like cell lines including BT-549 and MDA-MB-231
cells. Under the conditions we used, MENA11a co-migrates with
the 80-kDa MENA; thus, the intensity of the measured 80-kDa
MENA, detected with an antibody known to recognize all MENA
isoforms, represents the total amount of 80-kDa MENA plus
MENA11a in the cell lines that express both isoforms. There was
a significant inverse correlation between paclitaxel efficacy, as
measured by cell survival, and levels of endogenous MENA
expression (Fig. 1C). To confirm that endogenously expressed
MENA promotes paclitaxel resistance, we knocked down MENA
in T47D cells, which normally express MENA and MENA11a
(Supplementary Fig. S1E; refs. 19, 21). It is important to note
that the shRNA used for these experiments targets a sequence
common to all known MENA isoforms, thereby depleting

 MENA11a as well as MENA. Reducing all MENA isoform levels
(>75%) in T47D cells renders them more sensitive to paclitaxel
(Fig. 1D).
To study the role of MENA and MENAINV independently, we
used a triple-negative breast adenocarcinoma cell line (MDA-MB-
231), which endogenously expresses low levels of MENA and
like other cultured breast cancer cell lines only trace levels of
MENAINVin vitro. As endogenous MenaINV expression is highly
upregulated by aggressive tumor cells within the in vivo tumor
microenvironment (17, 22, 26), we stably overexpressed GFP
(231-Control), GFP-tagged MENA (231-MENA), or MENAINV
(231-MENAINV) at equivalent levels in this cell line to match the
Figure 2.

 robust expression observed in vivo. We observed that the fraction
of viable 231-MENA or 231-MENAINV cells was at least 65%
higher than the fraction of viable 231-Control cells, after 72 hours
of treatment with varying doses of paclitaxel (Fig. 1E). To inves-
tigate the specificity of the response, we also tested 2 other
commonly used chemotherapeutics, doxorubicin and cisplatin,
and found that neither MENA nor MENAINV expression affected
the response to the different concentrations of either drug (Sup-
plementary Fig. S1F and S1G). These experiments revealed that
cell viability in the presence of high paclitaxel concentrations is
decreased with low MENA expression and increased by ectopic
expression of MENA or MENAINV. These data suggest that the
increased levels of MENA isoforms observed in tumor cells during
metastatic progression may contribute to paclitaxel resistance.
MENA isoform expression is associated with increased tumor
growth in vivo during paclitaxel treatment
We then investigated whether MENA-associated paclitaxel resis-
tance could also be observed in vivo. Xenograft tumors were
generated by injecting MDA-MB-231 cells expressing MENA iso-
forms into the mammary fat pads of NOD/SCID mice. Mice were
treated with paclitaxel once tumors reached 1 cm in diameter (Fig.
2A).Treatment withpaclitaxelsignificantly decreased the growthof
231-Control tumors compared to mice treated with vehicle (Fig.
2B). However, the growth of 231-MENA or 231-MENAINV tumors
was unaffected by paclitaxel treatment (Fig. 2B), thereby suggesting
that MENA and MENAINV promote drug resistance in vivo.
The increased size of paclitaxel-treated 231-MENA and 231-
MENAINV tumors could arise from elevated levels of proliferation,
decreased levels of cell death, or both. We evaluated proliferation
and apoptosis by quantifying the intensity of cells positive for
Ki67 and CC3, respectively, by immunostaining. Although pac-
litaxel treatment decreased the amount of Ki67 staining in 231-
Control tumors, it failed to decrease the numbers of Ki67-positive
cells in 231-MENA and 231-MENAINV tumors (Fig. 2C and D). In
contrast, treatment did lead to an increase in cell death as marked
by CC3-positive cells in all tumors (Fig. 2E and F). These data
indicate that during paclitaxel treatment of tumor-bearing ani-
mals, MENA- or MENAINV-expressing tumor cells continue to
proliferate but exhibit similar rates of apoptosis to control tumors.
Paclitaxel treatment decreases cell velocity in vitro but does not
affect MENAINV-driven tumor cell motility and dissemination in
mice
MENA and MENAINV drive increased cell motility and metas-
tasis during tumor progression (17, 27). Therefore, we examined

ment decreased velocity of the 3 MENA isoform–expressing cell

the drug used, 231-MENAINV maintained higher velocity than

 morrow and the number of metastases in the lung from mice
bearing 231-Control, 231-MENA, or 231-MENAINV tumors for 12
weeks. Neither the number of bone marrow colonies (Fig. 3B) nor
the number of lung metastases (Fig. 3C and D) from 231-MENA
or 231-MENAINV tumors was affected by treatment with pacli-
taxel. These data suggest that highly metastatic cells, such as those
expressing MENA isoforms, are not affected by paclitaxel treat-
ment in the context of metastatic disease.
Paclitaxel treatment selects for high MENA expression in vitro
and in vivo
Our results so far indicated that increased MENA or MENAINV
expression levels are associated with reduced responses to pacli-
taxel. We next investigated the effect of paclitaxel treatment on
levels of MENA expression in cell populations in vitro and in vivo.
First, we analyzed endogenous MENA expression by Western
blotting in 5 breast cancer cell lines that were exposed to 100
nmol/L of paclitaxel or a vehicle control (Fig. 4A). We found that
72 hours after paclitaxel treatment, some cell lines (MDA-MB-231
and MDA-MB-175VII) showed increased MENA expression (Fig.
4B). We performed a similar analysis using MDA-MB-231 cell
populations expressing heterogeneous levels of GFP, GFP-MENA,
or GFP-MENAINV. FACS analysis revealed that treatment with
docetaxel (a taxane closely related to paclitaxel) selected for cells
expressing higher levels of GFP-MENA or GFP-MENAINV, but not
of GFP (Fig. 4C). Finally, quantitative immunofluorescent anal-
ysis of tissue sections from 231-Control tumors taken from
animals that were treated with either paclitaxel or a vehicle control
revealed significant increases in total MENA levels, detected by a
pan-MENA antibody, and in MENAINV levels, detected by an anti-
MENAINV isoform–specific antibody, in tumors from the pacli-
taxel-treated mice compared with vehicle (Fig. 4D–F). Together,
these data indicate that, both in vitro and in vivo, paclitaxel
treatment selects for tumor cells expressing a higher level of MENA
and MENAINV.
MENA isoform–driven resistance does not involve drug efflux
or focal adhesion signaling but does affect cell division
We next investigated the mechanism by which MENA and
MENAINV increase resistance to paclitaxel. Paclitaxel efflux
through the MDR1 pump is one of the most frequent and best
described mechanisms of paclitaxel resistance (9). Co-treatment
with HM30181, a third-generation MDR1 inhibitor (31), and
100 nmol/L of paclitaxel negligibly affected the fraction of viable
231-Control cells and did not increase paclitaxel efficacy in 231-
MENAINV cells (Supplementary Fig. S3A). Focal adhesion signal-
ing has been reported to promote resistance to paclitaxel (36), and
we previously reported that MENA regulates focal adhesion
signaling via a direct link between an LERER repeat domain in
MENA and the cytoplasmic tail of a5-integrin (32). To determine
whether the interaction between MENA and a5 is required for
increased resistance to paclitaxel, we assayed cells expressing a5-
binding deficient versions of MENA or MENAINV (lacking the
LERER repeat domain) and found that these mutant versions were
equally effective to the wild-type versions in increasing resistance
to paclitaxel (Supplementary Fig. S3B). These data indicate that
neither drug efflux nor the MENA–a5 interaction mediates MENA
isoform–driven resistance to paclitaxel.
One of the key steps in paclitaxel-induced cell death is cell arrest
in the G2–M phases of the cell cycle. We performed cell-cycle
analysis on 231-Control, 231-MENA, and 231-MENAINV cells
treated with 10 or 100 nmol/L of paclitaxel for 16 hours (Sup-
plementary Fig. S4A–S4C) and found a similar dose-dependent
increase of cells in the G2–M phase across all three cell lines.
Therefore, MENA or MENAINV expression does not impair pac-
litaxel-induced arrest in G2–M, as measured in cells in suspension
by flow cytometry. We next performed time-lapse microscopy to
study the cell division phenotypes in more detail and imaged cells
expressing MENA isoforms while adherent on collagen (Supple-
mentary Fig. S4D–S4F). Treatment with paclitaxel increased
the time that 231-Control cells spent rounded in cell division
by 4-fold; however, 231-MENA and 231-MENAINV showed only a
2-fold increase in the time spent in cell division (Supplementary
Fig. S4G). Furthermore, paclitaxel treatment led to a 40% decrease
in the number of successful divisions in 231-Control cells, in
which one cell divides into 2 surviving daughter cells (Supple-
mentary Fig. S4H). In contrast, more than 90% of cell divisions in
paclitaxel-treated 231-MENA and 231-MENAINV cells were suc-
cessful (Supplementary Fig. S4H). Together, these data suggest
that MENA isoform expression confers the ability to progress
through cell division more effectively and successfully during
treatment with paclitaxel.
Expression of MENA is associated with increased ratio of
dynamic to stable microtubules during paclitaxel treatment
Paclitaxel promotes cell death by increasing the stability of
microtubules, and pathways driving increased microtubule
dynamics are known to promote resistance to taxanes (10).
Therefore, we examined microtubule structure and dynamics in
MENA isoform–expressing cells during paclitaxel treatment.
We found that at baseline, 231-MENA and 231-MENAINV cells
contained longer microtubules (Supplementary Fig. S5A–S5C).
Paclitaxel treatment had no effect on microtubule length in either
231-Control or 231-MENA cells but did elicit a small but signif-
icant increase in 231-MENAINV cells (Supplementary Fig. S5C).
Posttranslational modification of microtubules can regulate their
dynamics, and antibodies that detect such modifications can be
used to infer the relative dynamics of microtubule populations; in
particular, microtubule tyrosination indicates a dynamic micro-
tubule state, whereas detyrosination of microtubules is associated
with increased stability (37). We measured the relative abundance
of stable (Glu-MT) versus dynamic (Tyr-MT) microtubules in
individual cells by immunofluorescence with anti-Glu-MT and
anti-Tyr-MT antibodies (Fig. 5A and B). In 231-Control cells,
treatment with paclitaxel led to a significant increase in the relative
ratio of stable to dynamic microtubules. However, in both 231-
MENA and 231-MENAINV cells, there was no change in the relative
levels of stable to dynamic microtubules (Fig. 5C). Together, these
data demonstrate that MENA isoforms can affect microtubule
length and that MENA isoform expression maintains dynamic
microtubules during paclitaxel treatment.
MENA drives resistance to paclitaxel by increasing MAPK
signaling
The MAPK signaling cascade is among the key pathways known
to interact with microtubules. Both ERK1/2 interact with micro-
tubules; microtubule stabilization by paclitaxel increases ERK
phosphorylation and, in turn, ERK pathway activation increases
microtubule dynamics (10). We measured levels of ERK phos-
phorylation in 231-Control, 231-MENA, and 231-MENAINV cell
lines after 72 hours of paclitaxel treatment. We found that 231-
MENA and 231-MENAINV cells had higher levels of pERK Y204

 relative to 231-Control cells, after paclitaxel treatment, whereas
total ERK levels were unchanged in the same conditions (Fig. 6A
and B and Supplementary Fig. S6A and S6B). In contrast, treat-
ment with paclitaxel decreased pAkt473 levels equally in all 3 cell
lines, without significantly changing total Akt levels (Supplemen-
tary Fig. S6C–S6F). We therefore asked whether MEK inhibition
(MEKi) could make MENA isoform–expressing cells more sensi-
tive to paclitaxel. In all cell lines, we found significant additive
effects between paclitaxel and MEKi PD0325901 in a proliferation
assay (Fig. 6C–E), where treatment with both drugs simultaneous-
ly led to a greater increase in cell death than with each drug alone.
However, higher concentrations of each drug were needed in 231-
MENA and 231-MENAINV cells to obtain high levels of cell death,
relative to 231-Control cells. MEKi treatment blocked paclitaxel-
induced ERK phosphorylation in 231-MENAINV cells (Fig. 6F).
Finally, weinvestigated the effect of paclitaxel andMEKi treatment
on microtubule dynamics in 231-MENAINV cells and found that
treatment with both drugs simultaneously induced increases in
stable microtubules relative to dynamic microtubules whereas
treatment with either drug alone had no effect (Fig. 6G and H).
Together, these data suggest that MENA isoforms drive resistance
to paclitaxel via sustained microtubule dynamics and increased
ERK signaling.
Discussion
Previous work has identified several MENA isoforms, in par-
ticular MENAINV, as key drivers of metastatic breast cancer, with
high MENAINV levels being associated with increased recurrence
and poor outcome in patients with breast cancer (17). Our data
highlight an additional, unexpected role for MENA and MENAINV
in driving resistance to paclitaxel by maintaining dynamic micro-
tubules during paclitaxel treatment. We found that MENA and
MENAINV expression maintains microtubule dynamics during
paclitaxel treatment, leading to increased MAPK signaling. While
taxanes remain the standard of care for metastatic breast cancer,
our data suggest that this class of drugs may not be as effective in
targeting certain highly invasive, metastatic cells.
We observed an inverse correlation between the levels of
endogenous MENA expression in cultured breast cancer cell lines
and sensitivity to paclitaxel. Ectopic expression of MENA or
MENAINV in cultured MDA-MB-231 cells, which have low levels
of endogenous MENA, decreased sensitivity to paclitaxel. Con-
versely, in T47D cells, which endogenously express high levels of
MENA and MENA11a, depletion of all MENA isoforms increased
sensitivity to paclitaxel. Together, these data indicate that MENA
expression promotes resistance to paclitaxel. Because MENA11a
as well as MENA are expressed in T47D and in some of the other
cell lines in our analysis, it is possible that MENA11a can con-
tribute to paclitaxel resistance, although we did not perform any
experiments to address whether or not MENA11a plays a func-
tional role in resistance to paclitaxel. In this context, however, it is
of interest to note that, while a role for MENA11a in resistance to
chemotherapy remains unknown, MENA11a expression contri-
butes to resistance to PI3K inhibitors in HER2-overexpressing
breast cancer cells (38). While beyond the scope of this study, it
will be interesting to determine the extent to which other
MENA11a and other MENA isoforms may contribute to paclitaxel
resistance and how taxane therapy may affect expression of all
MENA isoforms in patients.
Superficially, it may seem paradoxical that aggressive breast
cancer cell lines, such as MDA-MB-231 and BT-549, express low
levels of endogenous MENA and only trace levels of MENAINV
when cultured in vitro. Our previous results indicate that MENA
and MENAINV expression is upregulated significantly in aggressive
tumor cell subpopulations when cultured breast cancer cells are
implanted to make orthotopic tumors in immunocompromised
mice (22). Therefore, it is likely that growth in the tumor micro-
environment triggers changes in gene expression and alternative
splicing in xenografted cells that increase the abundance of MENA
and MENAINV during tumor progression, similar to what is
observed in autochthonous mouse mammary carcinomas and
human breast tumors (26). As our goal in this study was to
determine investigate how MENA isoform expression might affect

 patients with breast cancer with aggressive, potentially metastatic
disease, we designed our experiments on the basis of knowledge
derived from studies of MENA isoform expression in tumor cells
in vivo. To mimic the effect of the tumor microenvironment on
MENA isoform expression for analyses in vitro, we engineered
MDA-MB-231 cells to express MENA or MENAINV, the 2 isoforms
expressed in patients with aggressive, metastatic breast cancer.
Our experiments demonstrated that MENA isoforms expressed in
metastatic tumors confer resistance to paclitaxel, and, conversely,
that paclitaxel treatment results in increased expression of MENA
and MENAINV in tumors. Because we found that paclitaxel treat-
ment was less effective in reducing metastatic burden in tumors
with elevated MENAINV, it is possible that taxane- based therapy
may, in some cases, trigger elevated expression MENAINV expres-
sion that, in turn, both promotes metastasis and decreases the
efficacy of the treatment. Studies to investigate this possibility are
underway.
How MENA/MENAINV might promote resistance to taxanes?
We initially hypothesized that the role of MENA in regulating
focal adhesion signaling may be important in this context, given
the established links between focal adhesions and microtubules
(39), as well as the known abundance of MENA at focal adhesion
sites and its direct interaction with the a5-integrin subunit (17,
32).We found, however, thatinteraction with a5 was not required

 for MENA-dependent increases in taxane resistance (Supplemen-
tary Fig. S2). After paclitaxel treatment, MENA-expressing cells
showed an increase in the abundance of dynamic microtubule
populations, in paclitaxel-treated cells (Fig. 5). Therefore, it will
be interesting to understand whether MENA influences micro-
tubules via association with microtubule-binding proteins,
through an effect on signaling pathways that regulates microtu-
bule dynamics, or both.
Interestingly, under control conditions, our data show that
MENA or MENAINV expression increased microtubule length,
supporting a role for MENA in regulation of microtubule behavior
(Supplementary Fig. S4). Consistent with these findings, siRNA
depletion of Enabled (Ena), the sole Drosophila MENA ortholog
(18) in Drosophila S2 cells, induced significant changes in micro-
tubule
dynamics,
suggesting
a
potentially
evolutionarily
conserved role for MENA in regulating microtubule dynamics.
However, under control conditions, we did not detect any changes
in tyrosination at the whole-cell level, which may be due to the
fact that whole-cell immunofluorescence is not sensitive enough
to detect subtle differences (Fig. 5). It is clear, however, that some
actin regulatory proteins can regulate microtubule dynamics. For
example, formins, actin nucleating and elongation factors, can
also act as positive regulators of microtubule organization and
stability (40). For example, complexes containing the activated
forms of the formins mDia1 and INF2 along with the scaffolding,
and microtubule-binding protein IQGAP1 can increase microtu-
bule stabilization via direct interaction with microtubules (41),
and microtubule regulators can also influence formin-dependent
actin dynamics (42). Interestingly, a genetic screen in Drosophila
identified Ena as a dosage-sensitive modifier of phenotypes asso-
ciated with ectopic expression of the microtubule þ TIP tracking
protein CLASP (43). Therefore, future work focused on the
interplay between the actin-based cell motility machinery and
microtubule regulation using fluorescent reporters for microtu-
bule tip proteins coupled to live imaging may yield additional
insight into the acquisition of taxane resistance by metastatic
cancer cells.
Paclitaxel resistance driven by MENA isoforms leads to sus-
tained microtubule dynamics that, in turn, leads to increased ERK
signaling, at least in vitro (Fig. 6). Disruption of microtubule
dynamics can lead to ERK phosphorylation, and MAPK activation
can inhibit microtubule stabilization (14, 44, 45). Therefore, a
feedback mechanism may act to balance MAPK pathway activity
with microtubule dynamics. Our data indicating that combined
treatment with paclitaxel and MEKi, but not with either drug
individually, leads to increased microtubule stability in MENAINV
cells, raising the possibility that MENAINV alters the balance
between MAPK signaling and microtubule dynamics (Fig. 6). In
a breast cancer cohort, MENA expression, as assessed by IHC,
correlated with pERK and pAkt staining, with a higher number of
pERK and pAkt positivity in MENA-positive tumors, irrespective
of Her2 status (46). Depletion of all MENA isoforms in the MCF7
Her2-overpressing line decreased ERK signaling and inhibited
EGF/NRG1-mediated effects on cell proliferation (46). These data
are consistent with a potential role for MENA in regulating ERK
signaling. Alternatively, activation of bypass signaling pathways
such as the Akt pathway occurs downstream of integrins in
response to paclitaxel treatment, even in the absence of differences
in G2–M arrest (47). Interestingly, there were no MENA isoform–
induced differences in the levels of Akt phosphorylation (Sup-
plementary Fig. S6), which were significantly decreased in all 3 cell
lines, during paclitaxel treatment. This finding is also consistent
with our in vivo data showing that during paclitaxel treatment,
MENA isoform expression selectively increases proliferation,
which is relatively more sensitive to MAPK signaling, but not
apoptosis, which is relatively more sensitive to Akt signaling.
Finally, our data suggest that combined treatment of a taxane with
a MEKi could bypass MENA isoform–driven resistance (Fig. 6).
Several groups have previously shown that treatment with a
MEKi can enhance paclitaxel-driven cell death in vitro and in vivo
(48–50). Multiple clinical trials are currently underway in
advanced solid tumors, such as melanoma and non–small cell
lung cancer, testing combinations of taxanes and the MEK inhib-
itor trametinib (51).
Our data reveal an interesting relationship between the
response of highly metastatic cells to taxanes and the effect of
taxanes on highly metastatic cell populations in tumors that could
have important clinical implications. First, following paclitaxel
treatment, MENA and MENAINV protein expression was higher in
both in vitro and xenograft tumors, suggesting that residual
surviving cells have undergone a selection for increased MENA
and MENAINV levels (Fig. 4). Second, we found that MENAINV-
driven tumor cell motility and metastasis are not affected by
paclitaxel treatment (Fig. 3). Paclitaxel is widely used as adjuvant
therapy to prevent breast tumor relapse and metastasis (52). Our
data suggest that paclitaxel may be less effective in treating
patients who have primary tumors expressing high levels of
MENAINV. While here we focused on TNBC, reduction in MENA
levels in estrogen receptor–positive breast cancer cells also altered
sensitivity to paclitaxel (Fig. 1), raising the possibility that this
mechanism may be important in other subtypes. Currently, there
are no biomarkers that predict response to taxanes in patients
(53). MENA isoforms are being developed as biomarkers in breast
cancer to predict metastatic potential and to guide patient treat-
ment (54). We also recently developed a MENAINV isoform–
specific antibody and used it to demonstrate that metastatic
tumors express higher MENAINV than nonmetatastic primary
tumors and that high MENAINV protein levels were significantly
associated with poor outcome and recurrence in a breast cancer
patient cohort (17,26). While further work isneeded toestablish a
clear link between MENAINV expression and resistance to pacli-
taxel in patients, it will be interesting to study how paclitaxel
increases MENAINV expression and whether this may contribute to
a more aggressive phenotype in posttreatment residual tumor cell
populations.
