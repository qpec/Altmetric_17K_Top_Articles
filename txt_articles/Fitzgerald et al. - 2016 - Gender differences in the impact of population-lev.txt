 Abstract 
 
Background: Consistent review-level evidence supports the effectiveness of population-level alcohol 
policies in reducing alcohol-related harms.  Such policies interact with well-established social, 
cultural and biological differences in how men and women perceive, relate to and use alcohol, and 
with wider inequalities, in ways which may give rise to gender differences in policy effectiveness.   
 
Aims: To examine the extent to which gender-specific data and analyses were considered in, and are 
available from, systematic reviews of population-level alcohol policy interventions, and where 
possible, to conduct a narrative synthesis of relevant data.   
 
Methods: A prior systematic ‘review of reviews’ of population level alcohol interventions 2002-2012 
was updated to May 2014, all gender-relevant data extracted, and the level and quality of gender 
reporting assessed.  A narrative synthesis of extracted findings was conducted. 
 
Results: Sixty-three systematic reviews, covering ten policy areas, were included.  Five reviews (8%) 
consistently provided information on baseline participation by gender for each individual study in 
the review and twenty-nine (46%) reported some gender-specific information on the impact of the 
policies under consideration.  Specific findings include evidence of possible gender differences in the 
impact of and exposure to alcohol marketing, and a failure to consider potential unintended 
consequences and harm to others in most reviews.   
 
Conclusions: Gender is poorly reported in systematic reviews of population-level interventions to 
reduce alcohol-related harm, hindering assessment of the intended and unintended effects of such 
policies on women and men.   
 
 
 
 
 Introduction 
1 
The identification and implementation of effective policies to reduce the adverse consequences of 
2 
alcohol is a major public health imperative (1).  While the heterogeneity of the interventions and 
3 
outcomes may impede understanding of the mechanisms of effect, (2–4), consistent review-level 
4 
evidence supports the effectiveness of population-level alcohol policy interventions.  These include 
5 
those involving regulatory enforcement such as increased taxation or price controls, drink-driving 
6 
limits, and the regulation of availability and marketing (4,5).   
7 
 
8 
There is persistent and strong evidence, from multiple countries worldwide, that men and women 
9 
relate to, perceive and use alcohol differently (6,7).  “Nearly everywhere that epidemiological or 
10 
ethnographic research has been carried out, historically and cross-culturally, men have consumed 
11 
more alcohol than women” (8)(p153).  Women are more likely to abstain; men are more likely to 
12 
drink heavily and develop alcohol problems (7,9).  Women are more likely to suffer intimate partner 
13 
violence; men to engage in drink-driving (5).   
14 
 
15 
While sex-linked biological differences influence alcohol consumption and related harms (7,10), the 
16 
variation in magnitude of differences in drinking between men and women (6,7,10,11), and the 
17 
convergence in consumption levels between men and women in many countries over recent 
18 
decades (7,11–14), suggest that societal and cultural influences may be more important.  Public 
19 
excessive drinking has historically been perceived as a demonstration of ‘masculinity’ in western 
20 
societies (15).  Alcohol consumption has historically been associated with fewer social sanctions for 
21 
men than women (10,16), particularly among poorer populations (17).   
22 
 
23 
The convergence in drinking between women and men has largely been attributed to a rise in 
24 
women’s drinking rather than a fall in men’s (18–21).  Hypothesized influences include greater 
25 
gender equality, marriage and parenting at an older age, increasing female participation in the 
26 
workplace and financial independence, changes in drinking environments such as bar design, and 
27 
more mixed-gender drinking occasions (16).  The alcohol industry is likely to have played, and 
28 
continues to play, a role through deliberate differentiation between men and women in product 
29 
development, targeting and marketing: “in many countries [women] have been the obvious group in 
30 
which the market has been far from saturated” (16).   
31 
 
32 
Policies which attempt to reduce alcohol-related harms interact with social, cultural and biological 
33 
differences in how men and women relate to, perceive, and use alcohol.  For this reason alone, there 
34 
may be gender differences in the effectiveness and unintended effects of alcohol policy 
35 
interventions.  In addition, these differences intersect with wider gender inequality, which is 
36 
acknowledged as an influential social determinant of health (22–24): “sex and society interact to 
37 
determine who is well or unwell, who is treated or not, who is exposed or vulnerable to ill health and 
38 
how, whose behaviour is risk-prone or risk-averse, and whose health needs are acknowledged or 
39 
dismissed” (23).  Increasing recognition of structural gender inequality, and its links with economic 
40 
and other inequality, has led to efforts to ‘mainstream gender’ within policy-making more broadly 
41 
(25–28), as well as calls for greater attention to gender in research(23,24,29–31). 
42 
 
43 
‘Umbrella’ reviews (reviews of reviews) are increasingly used to synthesize systematic review 
44 
evidence (32).  Published umbrella alcohol policy reviews (4,5) have not focused on how well-
45 
represented females are in studies, or the potential role of gender differences in influencing overall 
46 
policy effectiveness.  Therefore, the aims of this umbrella review were to: 
47 
 
48 
 
examine the extent to which sex/gender data and analyses were considered in, and are 
49 
available from, systematic reviews of population-level alcohol policy interventions  
50 
  
conduct a narrative synthesis of findings from systematic reviews relating to sex/gender 
51 
differences in effectiveness or potential effectiveness of such interventions. 
52 
 
53 
Given the difficulty of separating differences in ‘sex’ (biological differences between men and 
54 
women) and ‘gender’ (cultural constructions of masculinity and femininity), we refer to ‘gender’ to 
55 
encompass both, in line with current thinking (33). 
56 
 
57 
 
58 
Methods 
59 
Search Strategy 
60 
Martineau and colleagues previously conducted a review of reviews in 10 alcohol policy areas (“the 
61 
Martineau review”) without focusing  on sex/gender (4).  It was used as the starting point for this 
62 
umbrella review.  Their search strategy (Table 1)  from October 2012, identified 52 reviews from 
63 
2002 onwards from six databases (4); all 52 were included in this current review.   
64 
<Table 1 to be inserted here> 
65 
 
66 
The Martineau review search strategy was re-run for the period 1st July 2012 to 19th May 2014, to 
67 
allow for delays in indexing.  Six academic literature databases were searched: five the same as 
68 
those searched by Martineau and colleagues (Medline, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects 
69 
(DARE), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Campbell Collaboration Library of Systematic 
70 
Reviews, and a site search of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence’s (NICE) website); 
71 
and one covering the same subject areas (Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts) as an older 
72 
database used by Martineau and colleagues (Social Policy and Practice).  No reviews included in 
73 
Martineau were identified only in the latter database.   
74 
Results Screening 
75 
The search results were downloaded into bibliographic software (RefWorks) and duplicates 
76 
removed.  Two researchers (KA, NF) assessed the new reviews by first applying the Martineau review 
77 
inclusion criteria (4)(p.259) to titles and abstracts, and then, if necessary, to the full text.  The 
78 
inclusion criteria were:  
79 
1. Does the review have a stated aim to evaluate interventions to reduce alcohol use 
80 
and/or related harm, and report outcome data on alcohol use and/or related harm? 
81 
2. Does the review concern intervention effectiveness? (And include studies with 
82 
controlled, before-and-after or time series designs.) 
83 
3. Is at least one of the interventions reviewed population level? (Exclude interventions 
84 
involving interaction between health professionals and individuals or groups, and 
85 
interventions selectively targeting high-risk individuals, such as those convicted of 
86 
alcohol-related offences.) 
87 
4. Is the review a systematic review? (If the study reports search strategy details, inclusion 
88 
and exclusion criteria, and clearly identifies all included studies. Exclude reviews of 
89 
reviews.)  
90 
 
91 
If the answer to all four questions above was yes, the review was included and assigned to the 
92 
relevant policy area.  In the event of any disagreement or doubt about eligibility that could not be 
93 
resolved by discussion between KA and NF, a third researcher (LB) read the review to resolve 
94 
disagreement by majority opinion.  We planned to use updated reviews in place of the original 
95 
reviews; however no updated reviews were identified by our search.   
96 
 
97 
 The Martineau review did not limit the searches by language, although all the included reviews were 
98 
in English.  In our updated search, we excluded non-English language reviews due to lack of 
99 
resources for full-text translation.  We planned to list any identified by our search, however none 
100 
emerged.  In both the original and updated searches, reviews were not excluded on the basis of 
101 
methodological quality other than as outlined in the above criteria.  This is in line with guidance on 
102 
synthesizing evidence on health equity which emphasises an inclusive approach (34). 
103 
 
104 
Data Extraction 
105 
 
106 
Each review was assessed for relevant sex/gender content as follows: 
107 
 
108 
 
Searchable PDF documents: electronic searches were conducted for key terms (including: 
109 
male female women woman man men girl boy gender sex mother father maternal paternal 
110 
daughter son pregnant pregnancy schoolgirl schoolboy husband wife wives spouse spousal); 
111 
 
Data extraction tables within reviews:  scanned for findings reported by gender using the 
112 
abbreviations ‘f’ and ‘m’, or ‘w’ and ‘m’. 
113 
 
PDF documents that were not fully text-searchable or photocopies: full text read carefully 
114 
for key terms. 
115 
 
116 
Data were extracted from systematic reviews using a standardised framework (Table 2), which was 
117 
developed and revised by two researchers (NF, KA).  Initially, data were extracted using the 
118 
preliminary framework from three reviews, one from each of three policy areas, by the two 
119 
researchers independently.  The results were reconciled, and a consensus reached on adaptations to 
120 
the framework.  The adapted framework was applied independently to two new reviews in two 
121 
more policy areas.  The final version of the data extraction framework (Table 2) was agreed and 
122 
applied to all the remaining identified reviews by one researcher.  A sample of reviews in each policy 
123 
area was checked for accuracy by a second researcher. 
124 
 
125 
Many reviews included studies not relating to population-level alcohol policy interventions (e.g. 
126 
studies measuring the effectiveness of policy interventions for other addictive substances or those 
127 
targeting an individual rather than a population).  As in the Martineau review, data relating to these 
128 
studies were not extracted.  Within the eligible reviews, data were extracted from relevant studies 
129 
of any design.   
130 
 
131 
<Table 2 to be inserted here> 
132 
Data analysis 
133 
 
134 
The level and quality of reporting of sex/gender data in the reviews was analysed summatively for 
135 
each policy area using the items included in the data extraction framework (Table 2).  An overall 
136 
narrative synthesis of sex/gender-relevant findings was conducted, as well as for individual policy 
137 
areas.   
138 
 
139 
Results 
140 
In total, 63 unique systematic reviews were identified and included (52 from the Martineau review, 
141 
and 11 from our updated search: see Figure 1).   Table 3 shows the reviews categorised into 10 
142 
broad alcohol policy areas as defined by Martineau: three reviews covered two policy areas and one 
143 
review covered three policy areas.

151 
<Table 4 to be inserted here> 
152 
 
153 
Most of the systematic reviews (87%, n=55) did not plan to conduct pooled analysis of intervention 
154 
effects by gender (Table 4).  Seven of the 8 reviews which did plan to do so reported insufficient data 
155 
in the primary studies to enable such analysis (35–41).  The eighth of these reported pooled effects 
156 
by gender in the area of higher education interventions (42), and a review of mass media 
157 
interventions did post-hoc pooled gender analysis (43) (see policy findings below).   
158 
 
159 
Five reviews (8%) (37–39,41,44) ‘consistently’ provided information on baseline participation by 
160 
gender for the individual studies included in the review; four of these were conducted for the 
161 
Cochrane Library.  Another review sometimes (45) and another rarely (46) provided such 
162 
information; the rest (89%, n=56) never did so.   
163 
 
164 
More than half of the reviews (54%, n=34) provided no information on individual study findings 
165 
relating to the impact of the reviewed policy by gender, and there was wide variation in the location, 
166 
quality and level of detail of information provided for those which did (Table 4).  
167 
 
168 
Gender-relevant findings from systematic reviews 
169 
 
170 
Notwithstanding the gaps in reporting at review level, available information relevant to gender is 
171 
outlined below by policy area. 
172 
 
173 
Alcohol server setting/drinking environment (Table S1 – 6 reviews) 
174 
Five reviews focused on policies to prevent alcohol-related harm or intoxication in or around 
175 
licensed premises (47–51), with between 13 and 26 studies in each; a further review included a 
176 
single study of warning labels (52).  Across all six reviews, gender-relevant findings were reported 
177 
only for a single included study - of ‘Operation Drinksafe’ (a personalised risk-assessment in bars 
178 
involving the AUDIT screening tool and breath alcohol concentration measurement) – which 
179 
reported a greater reduction in AUDIT scores in women (p1588, Van Beurden et al., (2000) cited in 
180 
(47)). 
181 
 
182 
Sales Availability (Table S2 – 8 reviews) 
183 
Eight reviews, including between 13 and 132 studies, considered policies limiting the availability of 
184 
alcohol through hours/days of sale , outlet density and/or purchase age (53–60).  Gender-relevant 
185 
findings were reported for very few (15% or less) of the included studies in each review.  Such data 
186 
were reported for 5 of 88 studies in one review (54), all of which suggested that increasing outlet 
187 
density was associated with increased consumption or harms (suicides, night-time crashes, assaults) 
188 
in males, less so in females.  Another review (60) reported relevant findings for 10 of 69 studies, that  
189 
were more mixed suggesting either no effect or an enhanced effect in males.   
190 
 
191 
In another review, relevant data were reported from one paper which found that following an 
192 
extension of hours of sale in Scotland, women’s drinking increased while men’s decreased (Knight & 
193 
Wilson (61) as cited in (59)).  The same paper was cited in another review (56) as finding that the 
194 
introduction of Sunday alcohol sales in Scotland was associated with an increase in consumption 
195 
amongst males aged 18-45, with no significant change in women’s drinking..   
196 
 
197 
 Two reviews cited studies considering the effect of increased availability on assaults against women; 
198 
one suggested no effect (Norstrom & Skog, 2003 cited in (56)) and the other found a decrease in 
199 
assaults against women but could not conclude causation (Duailibi et al., 2007, cited in (62)).   
200 
 
201 
No gender-relevant data were reported for the 132 studies included in the one review of minimum 
202 
drinking age laws (58).   
203 
 
204 
Illicit alcohol – 1 review 
205 
No gender relevant data were reported for the 14 studies included in the review of policy options to 
206 
address illicit alcohol (63).   
207 
 
208 
Taxation/pricing (Table S3 – 4 reviews) 
209 
Gender relevant findings were reported for fewer than 25% of the studies included in the reviews, 
210 
which included between 9 and 50 studies overall.  No consistent differences in the direct effect of 
211 
increased price/taxation on consumption or harms in men compared to women were found.   
212 
 
213 
Two reviews (46,64) reported findings from 5 studies suggesting that higher prices were associated 
214 
with decreased male but not female harms, including suicide (Markowitz, 2003, cited in (46,64)) and 
215 
sexually transmitted diseases (Grossman 2004; Carpenter 2005 both cited in (46); Markowitz et al., 
216 
2005; Chesson et al., 2000 both cited in (64)).  A sixth study found an association between higher 
217 
prices and improved use of birth control and condoms that was only significant in males (Grossman 
218 
& Markowitz, 2005 cited in (64)). One other study (Heeb et al., 2003 cited in (65)) found a greater 
219 
increase in male spirits drinking with a decrease in price.   
220 
 
221 
Three studies found greater decreases in female than male drinking or harms with increased price 
222 
(Chaloupka & Wechsler, 1996; Makela et al., 2008; Academy of Medical Sciences, 2004, all in (46); 
223 
the latter also cited in (60)).  A further study (Herttua et al.2008a, as cited in (60)) found that a tax 
224 
reduction increased alcohol deaths more in females than in males.   
225 
 
226 
Finally, one study did not find any evidence that an overall increase in spirits consumption following 
227 
a decrease in price differed by gender (Kuo et al., 2003 cited in (65)).   
228 
 
229 
There was some consistency in studies considering indirect impact with five studies, all cited in one 
230 
review (46), suggesting an increase in price would reduce rapes (Cook and Moore, 1993), child abuse 
231 
perpetrated by females (but not males) (Markowitz & Grossman, 2000), sexual assault against 
232 
women (Markowitz, 2000, second listing), unwanted pregnancies/teen abortions (Sen et al., 2003 
233 
also cited in (64)) and violence aimed at wives (Markowitz, 2000).   
234 
 
235 
 
236 
Alcohol Marketing, Mass Media, Promotion, Counter-Advertising (Table S4 – 7 reviews) 
237 
Of the 7 reviews, Booth et al. (46) included the most relevant findings: males were found more likely 
238 
to be exposed to or influenced by broadcast advertising in 7 studies (Aitken, 1988; Casswell & Zhang, 
239 
1998; Chen et al., 2005; Kelly, 1998; Sargent, 2006; Stacy, 2004; Zwarun, 2006; all cited in (46)), 
240 
notably for beer, and such exposure was associated with increased consumption of beer in two 
241 
studies (Collins et al., 2003; Connolly, 1994, both cited in (46)).  Two studies found that point of sale 
242 
pricing/advertising may have increased female drinking to a greater extent than male drinking 
243 
(Saffer & Dave, 2003; Smith et al., 2005; both cited in (46)); 2 found no gender difference (Pederson, 
244 
2002; Yang & Raghubir, 2005; both cited in (46)).  Two studies found a greater exposure of females 
245 
to billboard and print media advertising (Dring & Hope, 2001; Jernigan, 2004; both cited in (46)) and 
246 
2 studies suggested that the effects of advertising bans were generally larger for females (Saffer & 
247 
Dave, 2003; Saffer & Dave, 2006; both cited in (46)).  One study found an association between 
248 
 possession of alcohol promotional items and binge drinking in girls and a stronger association 
249 
between such possession and alcohol initiation in girls rather than in boys (Fisher, 2007, cited in 
250 
(46)).  Finally, a different study found that males were more likely to have alcohol promotional 
251 
clothing items and that that was associated with a range of drinking variables (Workman, 2004, cited 
252 
in (46)). 
253 
The Jackson et al. review (60) was conducted by members of the same team as the Booth review 
254 
(46).  It covered three policy areas, and rather than conducting a new review, reported on the earlier 
255 
findings from the Booth review, however it summarised the findings slightly differently.  It reported 
256 
that younger age-groups and 15 to 17 year old girls experienced the greatest impact of alcohol 
257 
advertising, but did not highlight the finding from Booth that males may be more influenced by and 
258 
exposed to broadcast advertising.   
259 
 
260 
Drink-driving (Table S5 – 12 reviews) 
261 
No two reviews reported gender-relevant information from the same primary studies of drink-
262 
driving policy.  Reported studies suggested that such interventions have more of an impact on males 
263 
than on females in reducing consumption: (Carpenter et al., 2007 cited in (36)); breath alcohol 
264 
concentration (Zwicker, 2007 cited in (35); Kloeden & McLean, 1997; 1994 cited in (36)); crash-
265 
related hospital admissions (Hardes et al., 1985 cited in (66)); road traffic fatalities (Albalate et al., 
266 
2006, cited in (36)); and insurance claims for crashes (Mercer et al., 1996 also cited in (66)).  Other 
267 
studies suggested that females tended to be more compliant with drink driving laws (Timmerman et 
268 
al., 2003; Boots and Midford, 1999 both cited in (67); Kaplan and Prato, 2007 cited in (36)).  A small 
269 
number of studies across the reviews involved male drivers only. 
270 
 
271 
School-Based Interventions(Table S6 – 17 reviews) 
272 
There was no consistent evidence of gender differences in the effectiveness of school programmes 
273 
targeting alcohol.  Across all the reviews, gender relevant findings were reported for 14 studies, of 
274 
which six suggested greater impact of the intervention in females, five suggested greater impact in 
275 
males, and three found no gender differences.  There was limited evidence that males may have 
276 
responded better to classroom management interventions such as the ‘Good Behaviour Game’ 
277 
(Kellam et al., 2008 cited in (38)).  However, the review-level evidence for the effectiveness of 
278 
school-based interventions was weak overall (4). 
279 
 
280 
Higher Education-Based Interventions (Table S7 – 5 reviews) 
281 
There was no evidence to suggest gender differences in the effects of a range of higher-education 
282 
interventions focusing on alcohol.  One meta-analysis (42) of 62 individual and group-level 
283 
interventions for first year college students found that gender was not a significant moderator for  
284 
alcohol consumption post-intervention.   
285 
 
286 
Interventions Targeting Families/Communities (Table S8 – 4 reviews) 
287 
Reported review-level findings did not suggest a consistent gender difference in the efficacy of 
288 
family and community interventions:  two cited studies found no significant moderation of effect by 
289 
gender (Brody, 2006, Haggerty, 2007, both in (39)); another study suggested a negative impact on 
290 
females only (Wiggins et al., 2009, cited in (68)); another a greater positive impact on males (Perry et 
291 
al., 2003, cited in (69)); and a final study found a greater positive impact on females (Spoth et al., 
292 
1999a cited in (39)).   
293 
 
294 
Four trials of a female only intervention for daughters and their parents (mostly mothers) showed 
295 
signs of efficacy in the short to medium term (39) (p.12).

Workplace Interventions(Table S9 – 4 reviews) 
298 
 Few relevant findings were reported and there was no clear evidence overall for any specific gender 
299 
differences from the studies cited in these reviews (41,45,70,71).

Discussion  
303 
Although there is widespread recognition that “explicitly identifying to whom the evidence does or 
304 
does not apply, is necessary to formulate social policy initiatives… and to determine what 
305 
interventions are appropriate with particular populations” (72), gender has not been well-reported in 
306 
reviews of population-level alcohol policy.  Across 10 policy areas, and 63 reviews of population-level 
307 
alcohol policies, few or no reviews reported results by gender and some reported a lack of such data 
308 
in the primary studies.  Notwithstanding the lack of data in the reviews, the information extracted 
309 
suggests that there are likely to be gender differences that are relevant to policy effectiveness in 
310 
some areas.   
311 
 
312 
Policy Implications 
313 
 
314 
Possible gender differences exist in the area of alcohol marketing/mass media interventions, where 
315 
young men may be more affected by broadcast advertising especially for beer; and young women by 
316 
billboard/print advertising.  If broadcast advertising was subjected to restrictions (as has been 
317 
suggested (73) p19), which were not applied to print advertising, that may reduce advertising 
318 
exposure to a greater extent in young men and requires further investigation.   
319 
 
320 
In school and family interventions, a number of studies evaluated single-gender interventions aimed 
321 
at daughters (along with a parent, mainly their mothers) cited in (37,38).  These may reinforce 
322 
gender stereotypes and inequality, for example, by invoking even by their existence, a sense of 
323 
drinking being somehow more problematic, shameful or inappropriate for girls, than for boys (see de 
324 
Visser (74,75)).  It has been suggested that mass media campaigns focusing on ‘binge drinking’ can 
325 
fall into this category or engage in ‘victim-blaming’ in relation to sexual assaults sustained after 
326 
drinking alcohol (76).  No measures of this potential unintended outcome were reported in any of 
327 
the included reviews. 
328 
 
329 
While there were no consistent trends in the many gender differences reported in the impact of 
330 
increased alcohol prices or taxation on consumption or harms, studies did consistently report that 
331 
such interventions may have reduced harms such as assaults.  Importantly, these indirect outcomes 
332 
were not reported in reviews for eight of the ten policy areas, despite an increasing focus on ‘harm 
333 
to others’ from alcohol (77,78).   
334 
 
335 
Research implications 
336 
This review suggests a significant gap in the literature, which is not unusual.  Similar ‘gender 
337 
blindness’ has been reported in research in other health areas (79–81) and is both a symptom of, 
338 
and contributor to, wider gender inequality (22–24).  More basic research is required to better 
339 
consider, measure and report on the effectiveness of alcohol policy interventions by gender, as well 
340 
as potential unintended consequences such as gender stereotyping, and indirect effects including 
341 
‘harm to others’.   
342 
 
343 
Current developments may improve the analysis and reporting of sex and gender in health research.  
344 
Many research and governmental organisations require sex/gender issues to be addressed in 
345 
research proposals and policy initiatives (72).  In addition, a group of science editors have consulted 
346 
on common standards for reporting of sex/gender differences in scientific research (31).  Specific 
347 
guidance is available on how to address sex and gender issues in systematic reviews of policy 
348 
interventions (82).   
349 
  
350 
It remains to be seen how transformative initiatives to incorporate a gendered perspective will be: 
351 
long-standing efforts to mainstream gender into policy-making (83) have faced challenges (84) and 
352 
criticism for having a narrow ‘technocratic’ focus on processes (such as gender impact assessment 
353 
(85)) while failing to achieve societal change (25,28).  This review focused only on gender, however it 
354 
is important to acknowledge that gender inequality intersects with other forms of inequality 
355 
(including economic, racial, sexual orientation) in complex ways (23,30).  These interactions can have 
356 
important implications for alcohol-related harms (17,86,87), and require a broader focus in both 
357 
research and policy (22,29).   
358 
 
359 
Strengths and limitations 
360 
This umbrella review synthesizes a large amount of evidence about the impact of population-level 
361 
alcohol policy interventions on males and females, and adds to the current literature on alcohol and 
362 
gender, which focuses predominantly on consumption and consequences (7).  Its value is 
363 
constrained by a lack of focus on, and low levels of reporting of, gender-relevant data at review 
364 
level, either due to gaps in primary studies, selective reporting in the reviews, or more likely both.  
365 
This makes it difficult to speculate on the reasons for the differences found or to assume their wider 
366 
transferability.  Different reviews reported different aspects of the same primary studies and 
367 
working from reviews impeded judgement of the quality of the primary evidence.  Even reviews 
368 
which sought to analyse by gender were largely unable to do so, suggesting that further study of the 
369 
primary literature may not yield results that are any more conclusive.   
370 
 
371 
Conclusions 
372 
Gender differences in experiences of direct and indirect harm from alcohol are well established (87–
373 
89) but appear to be rarely considered in policy reviews.  Available evidence from systematic reviews 
374 
suggests that there may be plausible and important gender differences in the impact of population-
375 
level alcohol policy interventions which require further consideration in research and policy, 
376 
particularly in the area of advertising controls and mass media campaigns.

Martineau review, and of any design. 
Gender focus of review 
D. Did this review have a major and 
a priori focus on gender equity? 
If so, enter 1, 2 or 3 to indicate which type, using criteria 
from Welch et al., 2013 (34) (p2):  Type 1 Reviews assess 
effects of interventions in disadvantaged populations; Type 2 
Reviews assess effects of interventions aimed at reducing 
social gradients across populations; Type 3 Reviews have a 
major focus on equity and are “designed to assess the effects 
of interventions not aimed at reducing inequity but where it 
is important to understand the effects of the intervention on 
equity, positive or negative”.  
E. Was post-hoc analysis 
conducted of the effects of the 
intervention by gender? 
Yes/No or N/A (not applicable) if a priori analysis by gender 
was planned. 
F. Extract all gender-relevant data 
except from single-gender 
studies. 
Cut and paste any data on gender if relevant to population 
level alcohol interventions or policy.  
G. Extract all data from single-
gender studies. 
Cut and paste any data from single gender studies if relevant 
to population level alcohol interventions or policy.
