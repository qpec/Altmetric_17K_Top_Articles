BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Poor
appetite
in
older
adults leads to sub-optimal food intake and increases the
risk of undernutrition. The impact of poor appetite on
food intake in older adults is unknown. The aim of this
study was to examine the differences in food intake among
older community-dwelling adults with different reported
appetite levels.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of data from a longitu-
dinal prospective study.
SETTING: Health, aging, and body composition study
performed in the USA.
PARTICIPANTS: 2,597 community-dwelling adults aged
70–79.
MEASUREMENTS: A
semi-quantitative,
interviewer-
administered,
108-item
food
frequency
questionnaire
designed to estimate dietary intake. Poor appetite was
defined as the report of a moderate, poor, or very poor appe-
tite in the past month and was compared with good or very
good appetite.
RESULTS: The
mean
age
of
the
study
sample
was
74.5 � 2.8 years; 48.2% were men, 37.7% were black, and
21.8% reported a poor appetite. After adjustment for total
energy intake and potential confounders (including biting/
chewing problems), participants with a poor appetite had a
significantly lower consumption of protein and dietary fiber,
solid foods, protein rich foods, whole grains, fruits, and veg-
etables, but a higher consumption of dairy foods, fats, oils,
sweets, and sodas compared to participants with very good
appetite. In addition, they were less likely to report con-
sumption of significant larger portion sizes.
CONCLUSION: Older adults reporting a poor appetite
showed a different dietary intake pattern compared to
those with (very) good appetite. Better understanding of
the specific dietary intake pattern related to a poor
appetite in older adults can be used for nutrition interven-
tions to enhance food intake, diet variety, and diet quality.

P
oor appetite is an important problem in older persons,
with prevalence rates in community-dwelling older per-
sons varying between 11% and 15%.1,2 A poor appetite is
an important independent determinant of a reduced energy
intake3,4 associated with a lower diet quality4 and less diet
variety5 in older adults. Consequently, a poor appetite in
community-dwelling older persons is a risk factor for
undernutrition.2,6–8 As undernutrition is associated with
adverse clinical outcomes and reduced quality of life and
survival,9–11 effective strategies to increase food intake in
these older persons are needed.
Common approaches to improve appetite and food
intake in older adults include meal adaptations, such as
reducing portion sizes or increasing meal frequency12–14
and the use of flavor enhancers.15,16 However, no consis-
tent effects of these adaptations on food intake in older
adults have been observed. A few studies in hospitals14
and
nursing
homes12,17,18
showed
promising
effects
of feeding assistance, protected meal times, improved meal
ambiance and family-style meals on food intake12,14,17–20

 and body weight.17,18 However, these measures require
motivated staff and sufficient finances.21 A final approach
is to stimulate appetite by orexigenic drugs, but these
drugs may have serious side effects.22
Novel,
more
feasible
approaches
are
needed
to
increase the food intake of older persons with a poor
appetite.23 Research among specific groups suggests that
subjects with a poor appetite have specific food prefer-
ences.24,25 Knowledge of those food preferences could be
used to identify the risk of nutrient deficiencies, develop
attractive and nutritious foods and improve dietary intake
and diet quality. With poor appetite being an independent
parameter of undernutrition and poor outcomes in this
group, the aim of this study was to examine the differences
in dietary intake among community-dwelling older adults
with various levels of appetite.
METHODS
Study Sample
The health, aging, and body composition study is a
prospective cohort study investigating associations among
body composition, health conditions, and functional limi-
tations in older adults. Between April 1997 and June
1998,
three
thousand
seventy-five
community-dwelling
black and white men and women were enrolled. Partici-
pants were recruited from a random sample of white
Medicare-eligible residents and all of the black Medicare-
eligible residents in the Pittsburgh PA and Memphis TN
metropolitan areas.
Subjects who were eligible reported no difficulty walk-
ing .25 of a mile, climbing up 10 steps, and performing
basic activities of daily living. They also had to be free of
life-threatening illness, planning to remain in the geo-
graphic area for three or more years, and not enrolled in
any lifestyle intervention trials. All participants provided
written informed consent. The institutional review board
at each study site approved all protocols. The current
study uses dietary intake data from the year two examina-
tions and therefore has a cross-sectional approach.
Dietary Intake
Trained
interviewers
administered
a
semi-quantitative
block food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) at the year two
follow-up visit. This FFQ contained 108-items and was
used to estimate dietary intake over the previous year
(thereby excluding seasonal influences on food choice).
The FFQ was developed for the health, aging, and body
composition study by Block Dietary Data Systems26 using
24-hour recalls obtained in NHANES III from older
(>65 years) non-Hispanic white and black adults in the
Northeast or Southern U.S. Trained interviewers used
wood blocks, food models, standard kitchen measures,
and flash cards to estimate portion sizes. Interviews were
periodically monitored to ensure the quality and consis-
tency of the data collection procedures. Block Dietary
Data Systems determined the intake of energy, macronu-
trients, food groups, and solid foods. The healthy eating
index was calculated to measure compliance with U.S.
dietary guidelines.27 In addition, the relative consumption
of specific types of foods (processed fruits and fruit
juices, white bread, and high-fat products) was deter-
mined by dividing energy from these specific types of
foods by the energy consumed within the corresponding
food group. For example, processed fruit + fruit juices/all
fruits.
Appetite
Appetite was assessed by using the open-ended question:
in the past month, would you say that your appetite or
desire to eat has been. . .? The response options (very good,
good, moderate, poor, very poor, do not know) were read
by the interviewer and shown on a flash card. We
excluded three subjects who responded with “do not
know.” Appetite was categorized into three groups: very
good, good, and poor. The group with a poor appetite
combined relatively small numbers of subjects reporting
either a moderate, poor, or very poor appetite, all of
which indicate the absence of a good appetite. This catego-
rization was justified by preliminary analysis showing that
subjects with a moderate, poor, or very poor appetite had
a
comparable
energy
and
macronutrient
intake.
Appendix S1 reports the dietary intake for the five appetite
levels.
Potential Confounders
Age, sex, self-identified racial group, study site, education,
income, cognitive function, depression, number of house-
hold members, self-rated health status, smoking status,
and physical activity were all considered as potential con-
founders of the association between appetite and dietary
intake.
Age, sex, racial group, education (postgraduate, col-
lege, vocational training or some college, high school,
<high school), yearly family income (≥$50K, $25K to
<$50K, $10K to <$25K, <$10K), cognitive function (mini
mental state examination, MMSE),28 depression, self-rated
health status (excellent, very good, good, fair, poor),
smoking (current, past, never), and physical activity were
measured at year one of the health, aging, and body com-
position study (1997). Depression was assessed by the
CES-D10 scale, a 10-item instrument designed to measure
depressive
symptoms
experienced
during
the
previous
week.29,30 A score greater than 10 out of 30 was judged as
symptomatic depression. Physical activity was assessed by
self-report of time spent walking and exercising.31 Number
of household members and trouble with biting/chewing
foods (always, often, sometimes, seldom, never) were mea-
sured at year two examinations.
Statistical Analysis
General characteristics of the study sample were examined
by general descriptive statistics. For normally distributed
characteristics, differences between appetite groups were
examined using univariate logistic regression with appetite
(good or poor vs very good) as the dependent variable.
Differences in dietary intake between appetite groups were
examined by multinomial logistic regression using stan-
dardized variables (z-scores) of dietary intake variables as

 independent variables and appetite as the dependent vari-
able. For non-normally distributed variables, log-trans-
formed variables were entered into the regression model.
Multivariate analyses were adjusted for confounding
by adding the confounders to the regression model. Total
energy intake was added to the model if the (independent)
dietary intake variable was not expressed as a percentage
of total energy intake. Sex and race were tested as poten-
tial modifiers of the association between dietary intake and
appetite (interaction terms with P < .10 were regarded as
significant). The cut-off level for statistical significance for
differences between groups was P < .05. Statistical analy-
ses were performed using SPSS Statistics version 22.0 (SPSS
Inc.).
RESULTS
At year two of the health, aging, and body composition
study, 3,043 persons (99%) were still alive and 2,998 par-
ticipated in the follow-up visit. After excluding partici-
pants with missing values on appetite (n = 13) or FFQ
(n = 284), serious errors on the FFQ (n = 30; e.g., many
missing items or inconsistent answers), or unreasonably
dietary intakes (<800 or >4000 kcal/day in men or <500
or >3500 kcal/day in women, n = 74),32 2,597 partici-
pants were included for data analyses (Appendix S2).
General characteristics of the study sample are pre-
sented in Table 1. The mean age was 74.6 � 2.8 years,
48.2% were men, and 37.7% were black. A poor appetite
was reported by 21.8% of the study sample (n = 565).
Compared to the groups with a very good or good appe-
tite, the poor appetite group was on average older (ages:
75.0 vs 74.5, P < .005), had a lower BMI (P < .005), and
more often experienced unintentional weight loss (having
lost weight without trying), biting/chewing problems, and
depression (P < .001). Furthermore, they were significantly
more often female, black, current smoker, and had a lower
education level, income, health status, daily energy intake,
and healthy eating index (P < .05).
Intake of Macronutrients and Solid Foods
Table 2 shows the average daily macronutrient and food
group intake by level of appetite and reports the results of
univariate analyses. Results of multivariate analyses on dif-
ferences in macronutrient and food group intakes between
appetite groups, adjusted for total daily energy intake and
other potential confounders, are reported in Table 3.
When compared to participants with a very good appetite,
participants with a poor appetite had a lower intake of
(animal and vegetable) protein, higher intake of fat, and
lower intake of dietary fiber (consistent for fiber from
beans, grains, vegetables, fruits). They also reported a
lower consumption of solid foods (but the energy density
of solid foods was higher). The consumption of carbohy-
drates and alcohol was not significantly different between
participants with a poor or a very good appetite in multi-
variate analyses.
When compared to participants with a very good
appetite, participants with a good appetite showed a sig-
nificantly lower intake of energy, total protein, animal pro-
tein, fiber from vegetables, and fruits and solid foods, and
a higher energy density of solid foods, but the noted differ-
ences were smaller than the differences between the poor
and very good appetite groups (Tables 2, 3). Sensitivity

Appetite was assessed by asking: “In the past month, would you say that
your appetite or desire to eat has been: very good, good or moderate,
poor, very poor, or don’t know?” For this study, appetite level was classi-
fied as very good, good, or poor (moderate, poor, or very poor). Subjects
who responded with “don’t know” were excluded from analysis. Uninten-
tional weight loss was defined as having lost weight without trying.

 analyses to identify the impact of excluding subjects with a
moderate appetite from the poor appetite group showed
larger and more significant differences in macronutrient
and food group intake compared to the very good appetite
group (data not shown).
Food Groups and Portion Size
After adjustment for potential confounders, participants
with a poor appetite reported a significantly lower con-
sumption of protein rich foods, fruits and vegetables,
grains and whole grains, but a significantly higher con-
sumption of dairy foods (milk, yoghurt, cheese), fats and
oils, sweets, and sodas. The amount of absolute grain
consumption (number of servings per day) was signifi-
cantly lower only between participants with a poor appe-
tite
compared
to
those
with
a
very
good
appetite
(Tables 2, 4).
For all food groups except for dairy, grains, whole
grains, sweets, and desserts, similar trends (but with smal-
ler differences) were observed in participants with a good
appetite compared to a very good appetite (Table 4). Par-
ticipants with a poor and a good appetite consumed less
large or extra-large portions than participants with a very
good appetite (Table 4).
Intake of Specific Types of Foods
Compared to those with a very good appetite, older adults
with a poor appetite showed a significant higher intake of
fruit juices and processed fruits when expressed as % of

 interaction between race or gender and dietary intake vari-
able). In summary, gender and race modified the associa-
tion between alcohol intake and appetite. Gender also
modified the association between the intake of wholegrain
foods and appetite. Race modified the association between
the intake of dairy foods and appetite. Results for alcohol,
wholegrain foods, and dairy foods stratified for race and
gender are displayed in Appendix S2.
DISCUSSION
This study revealed differences in dietary intake between
community-dwelling older adults with various levels of
appetite. As expected, older adults with a poor appetite
reported a lower intake of energy, protein, fiber, solid
foods, fruits and vegetables, and large/XL portions; while
consuming more fats, sweets, sodas, and dairy foods than
older adults with a very good appetite. In addition, the
energy density of solid foods was higher than in older
adults with a very good appetite.
The appetite of participants was classified into very
good, good, and poor. We expected that older adults with
a poor appetite would have a different dietary intake than
older adults with a good or very good appetite. However,
our data show that participants with a good appetite also
reported a slightly lower intake of protein rich foods, fruits
and vegetables, and large portion sizes; and had a higher
consumption of fats and oils, sweets, and sodas. Thus,
there appears to be a continuous relationship between pat-
terns of dietary intake and levels of appetite from poor to
good and from good to very good.
Besides a reduced energy intake, the dietary patterns
identified in this study show that a poor appetite is associ-
ated with reduced protein and fruit and vegetable intake,
which could exacerbate sarcopenia36 and osteoporosis.37
Improvement of dietary patterns at an early stage could
prevent these unfavorable health issues. In order to main-
tain healthy eating patterns, it would be interesting to
identify predictors of a poor appetite and the associated
dietary patterns. Together with offering attractive and
nutritious foods and treating underlying diseases impairing
appetite, this could be a cost-effective approach to prevent
and treat undernutrition in older adults, thereby reducing
morbidity and mortality.
The distinct food choices of older adults with a poor
appetite could be explained by different food preferences
in those with anorexia of aging or disease-related anorex-
ia. So far, small studies performed in various countries,
care settings and disease backgrounds published inconsis-
tent findings on food preferences in older persons with a
poor appetite. In one study, cognitively impaired elderly
with anorexia when compared to non-anorexic elderly
showed a reduced global food intake and a reduced con-
sumption of certain food groups (meat, eggs, fish, and fruit
and vegetables) and a similar consumption of milk and
cereals.38 Others showed a dislike to fatty and heavy
food25 or a preference for certain protein and non-protein
foods in chronic ill elderly with anorexia.24 We previously
conducted computer tests, presenting pairs of photographic
images of foods categorized according to a certain charac-
teristic (e.g., high- or low-fiber) to older adults. A forced
choice methodology was used for every pair by asking,

 “what food do you most want to eat now?” The number
of choices for foods with a certain characteristic was
indicative of a certain food preference. We found that
older adults with a poor appetite preferred (color) varia-
tion, non-dairy, high-fiber foods, and solid texture.39
Similar to the literature,38,40 the current study showed
that older adults with a poor appetite had a lower intake
of protein-rich foods (1.6 vs 1.8 servings/day), fruits (1.8
vs 2.1 servings/day), and vegetables (2.6 vs 3.2 servings/
day) than those with a very good appetite, implying that
older adults with a poor appetite consume 10–20% less
than the group with a very good appetite, which is clini-
cally relevant, especially with a long-lasting poor appetite
and dietary intake. Some findings are inconsistent with
previous studies:24,38,39 older adults with a poor appetite
had a higher intake of dairy foods than subjects with a
very good appetite38 and a lower (instead of higher) intake
of dietary fiber and solid foods.39
The higher energy density of solid foods in older
adults with a poor appetite suggests a preference for fatty
and heavy foods. Consuming smaller portions of high den-
sity foods is a common way to provide sufficient energy,
for instance in subjects with insufficient dietary intake such
as hospital patients,33 or astronauts consuming foods with
an energy density of 3–4 kcal/g.34 We hypothesize that
choosing higher-density foods could be a natural mecha-
nism to ingest sufficient energy and nutrients and to miti-
gate against weight loss. This mechanism and the effect on
ingestion of other essential nutrients such as protein and
vitamin D need to be investigated in humans. However,

POOR APPETITE AND DIETARY INTAKE IN OLDER ADULTS

 evidence shows that increasing the energy density of meals
and snacks effectively improves energy intake and body
weight stabilization in older adults. This strategy is widely
used in daily practice.35
This is the first large-scale quantitative study investi-
gating dietary intake in older adults with various appetite
levels. The health, aging, and body composition study
cohort provides data on food intake and a number of gen-
eral and health characteristics that may confound the asso-
ciations under study. However, the large sample size and
large number of statistical tests can result in statistically
significant differences that may have limited clinical mean-
ingfulness. Moreover, it needs to be mentioned that our
conclusions are based on an American sample and cannot
be translated to older adults in other countries. Another
limitation of this study is that it used dietary intake pat-
terns obtained by a food frequency questionnaire as a mea-
sure of food preference. We cannot exclude that other
factors, including income and household member food
preferences, may have influenced intake.
The validity of the appetite question could also be
questioned: appetite is a subjective entity and no gold stan-
dard to assess appetite exists. However, the different appe-
tite levels were related to weight loss and energy intake,
indicating face validity of the applied appetite question.
While a person’s appetite may fluctuate over time, in this
study appetite was assessed at one time-point only. The
use of three appetite levels resulted in an under- or
over-estimation of dietary intake related to a poor appetite:
sensitivity analyses showed larger and more significant
differences after exclusion of subjects with a moderate
appetite.
The results of this study show several differences in
food consumption among community-dwelling older per-
sons with various appetite levels. This information is an
important first step in identifying specific food preferences
in older adults with a poor appetite and can be used to refine
nutrition interventions that aim to improve dietary intake
and diet quality in older adults with a poor appetite.
